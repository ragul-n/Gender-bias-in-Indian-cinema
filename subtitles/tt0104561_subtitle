1
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:06,292
Dehradun, a beautiful
paradise in the mountains,...

2
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:10,137
is situated far away from
the hustle and bustle of humanity.

3
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:15,141
And in this paradise are 12
chosen schools of lndia.

4
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,839
The very affluent
families of lndia,...

5
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:22,376
send their children
here for a good education.

6
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:27,486
Some own steel mills
and some, tea estates.

7
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:31,156
Every child is the
heir to millions.

8
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:38,259
Rajput School and College
is considered to be the best.

9
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:42,330
lt excels in academics
and is the best at sports.

10
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:47,470
Similarly, Queens Junior
College is the best for girls.

11
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:51,780
The boys from all the colleges
are crazy about them.

12
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:57,182
There is a place called
Mallroad, is centrally located.

13
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:00,719
Here you find
the shops run by the locals.

14
00:02:01,258 --> 00:02:05,456
The children of the poor locals
have an ordinary school....

15
00:02:05,796 --> 00:02:07,525
Model School and college.

16
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:11,524
The speciality of the boys here
is a poor academic record...

17
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:14,269
and a good record
for bad behaviour.

18
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:17,468
The exams are fast
approaching...

19
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,734
but the preparation at
Model College is different.

20
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:25,740
lf they have any goal, it is
the girls from Queens college.

21
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:31,782
Like every year,
the exams are over.

22
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:34,757
There is going to be an lnter
College sports competition.

23
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:37,758
The entire colony is busy
discussing who will ...

24
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:40,823
be the winner of lnter
College cup, this year.

25
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:58,579
Squeeze it a little more.
Pass me the spanner.

26
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:01,816
Ratan's cycle is ready?
- Just a a while longer.

27
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,116
l'll send Ratan over then.
- Uncle...

28
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:07,254
have some tea.
- No, l don't have the time, Anjali.

29
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:09,485
Give me number 13.

30
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:15,698
Does Ratan have any chances
of winning the cycle race?

31
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,135
l don't know. But he is
the champion of our college.

32
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:28,308
Hurry up. The boys are waiting.
- Yes, father.

33
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,248
Mr.Shakur, l am but a math
teacher at Model College.

34
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:37,451
Ask Mr.Ramlal about the probable
winners and losers in sports.

35
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:42,487
He is the coach. Well, Mr.Ramlal, how
are the sports preparations getting on?

36
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:45,726
Quite fine, Mr.Dube.
- Oh, really!

37
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:49,165
Shakur, you'll take charge
for a few days.

38
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:52,491
Yes, sir.
- Here's some money for the expenses.

39
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,447
Why are you standing idle?

40
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,290
Don't you have to train
the Model boys?

41
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:18,258
Or...Have you given up
the idea of competing?

42
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:55,830
Since the time the Rajput boys
won the tournament last year...

43
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:58,563
they seem to be walking
on air. The stupid...!

44
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:03,532
Criticism won't help. Our boys
will lag behind in every test.

45
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,674
That's not true, Mr.Dube.
- l am not referring to Ratan...

46
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:11,671
but to your younger son, Sanjay.

47
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:14,446
lf he passes the exams this year,
l will distribute sweets.

48
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:16,514
l will do it...
And plenty, too!

49
00:05:25,862 --> 00:05:29,127
Sanjaylal..l've found mine!
Only 2 marks!

50
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:31,457
Change it.
- Pass it quickly.

51
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:35,467
Have you found yours?
- Hey! l've found mine.

52
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:37,832
Let me have a look.
- None of my sums are right.

53
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:40,142
Hurry up.

54
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:42,276
Someone's here!

55
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,440
Who is there?

56
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:47,476
Who is there?

57
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:12,505
Thief! Catch him!

58
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:15,902
There he goes.
... catch him!

59
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,548
Stop the thief!
Hey Mister, stop him!

60
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:24,718
What were they doing?
- They were changing results.

61
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,918
Yes?
- All seems well.

62
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,297
Did Ratan tell father anything?
- No.

63
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,726
lf father would have known,
that would be the end of me.

64
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:52,648
Once again l lied to uncle
Ramlal to protect Sanju.

65
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:57,853
l don't know why, but l believe
that l can do anything for him.

66
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:09,492
l am still unaware of his
feelings for me.

67
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:23,111
Ratan, you changed my marks
in math again, didn't you?

68
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:25,114
Yes, my dear.

69
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,148
l will fail and you will
be responsible for it.

70
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:31,854
Be grateful that
l did not tell father.

71
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:34,587
Else, you would have been
thrown out as you were, my dear.

72
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:39,522
Hey! l don't fear anyone.
Besides, why are you patronising me?

73
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:43,332
Do you know what your problem is?
- What?

74
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,131
You want to achieve success
without any hard work.

75
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,838
Don't you know what integrity is?
- Sure.

76
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:52,799
You are the epitome of integrity.
You are Mahatma Gandhi

77
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:56,906
you are Sarojini Naidu.
- Hold this.

78
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:06,711
Let me have a look Wow!
Father was in great shape.

79
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,489
Hey, where did you find this?

80
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:21,501
ln 1965 Model College beat
Rajput in the cycle race...

81
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,638
for the first
and the last time.

82
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,801
My friends had brought me
home on their shoulders.

83
00:08:30,146 --> 00:08:32,512
Neither have l, nor have the
rest of our locals forgotten it.

84
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:39,255
The same event will take place
tomorrow. All eyes are on you, Ratan.

85
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:51,133
Who are the brave boys?
- Rajputs!

86
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,303
Who are the leaders?
- Rajputs!

87
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,682
At the lnter School sports meet
in the 100 metres race...

88
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:12,086
Shekhar Malhotra, last year's winner of
Rajput College is on the fourth track.

89
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:22,189
Shekhar Malhotra is first,
Ratanlal Sharma is second.

90
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:24,090
And Randhir Thapar is third.

91
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:27,268
lt appears that Sanjaylal
Sharma has sprained his ankle.

92
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:32,102
What happened?
- l sprained my ankle, else...

93
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,673
Otherwise you would have come first.
What lame excuses!

94
00:09:47,157 --> 00:09:50,524
Once again, Shekhar is first,
Ratanlal is second position.

95
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:54,260
Chances are that Rajput will
take championship once again.

96
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:58,563
Xavier's is leading at 245.
Rajput is second at 225.

97
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:00,563
Model is third at 210.

98
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:05,141
A sprain

99
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:10,806
6 schools are participating
in this event.

100
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:16,152
The first baton has
changed hands at 100 metres.

101
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:18,547
Rajput College is in the
lead and Xavier's is next.

102
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:24,285
The baton has changed
hands again at 200 metres.

103
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:27,221
Model is at the second.Whereas
Rajput is still in the lead.

104
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:30,496
The third baton has been
passed to Shekhar Malhotra...

105
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,165
and Ratanlal Sharma
is at his best to forge ahead.

106
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:37,771
And...What a wonderful
victory by Ratanlal Sharma.

107
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,176
And Model School gets
20 additional points.

108
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:43,179
That was wonderful,
Mr.Ramlal.

109
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,277
The 100m hurdle
race has started.

110
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:52,416
And Ratanlal has displayed
a miracle once again.

111
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:54,690
But Rajput is still
at the same position.

112
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:03,724
According to the
score board...

113
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:07,534
the lnter School Championship
is entirely dependent...

114
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,798
on the marathon cycle race.

115
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:13,798
lt's tough competition between
Rajput, Xavier's and Model.

116
00:11:15,178 --> 00:11:17,544
Whosoever
wins this cycle race...

117
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:20,213
will be deserving of the
lnter School championship.

118
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:38,565
And the 50 km marathon
cycling has started.

119
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:43,567
The participants will leave the
stadium, on uneven terrain...

120
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:47,501
to reach the highest
point and return.

121
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:51,304
We will be getting reports from
3 check points along the way.

122
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:03,758
'We will be successful!
Model College'

123
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,800
The cyclists have reached here...

124
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:23,145
and they are proceeding at great
speed towards Baramulla Hills.

125
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:52,497
l, Rakesh Sharma from
Pillar Rock check point...

126
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,743
welcome the spectators
at the stadium.

127
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:57,577
The cyclists will be
here at any moment now.

128
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:04,119
ln first place, is Randhir
Thapar from Xavier's College.

129
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:07,656
ln second place is
Vinay from Andrew's.

130
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,759
ln third place is
Shekhar Malhotra from Rajput.

131
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:14,296
ln fourth place is Ratanlal
Sharma from Model College.

132
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:40,314
And now the cyclists are
approaching the stadium.

133
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:43,748
At first place is Xavier's
followed by Lawrence...

134
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:46,161
Andrew's is third
and Peter's is fourth.

135
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:48,330
Next is Rajput
followed by Model.

136
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:50,866
There will be five laps
in the stadium.

137
00:13:51,968 --> 00:13:53,936
And Lawrence has
taken the lead.

138
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:00,266
Shekhar Malhotra is
trying his best.

139
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,207
And...

140
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,679
he has overtaken Peter's. Ratanlal
from Model is just behind him.

141
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,551
He has forged ahead of Andrews
and has now crossed Lawrence, too...

142
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:16,223
in second place. Shekhar has gone ahead
of Xavier's, taken the first place.

143
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:44,139
He missed by a hair's
breadth, Mr.Ramlal.

144
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:47,479
He would have defeated
Shekhar otherwise.

145
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:51,516
No, Dube l believe
in one motto alone...

146
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:53,856
''He who wins is
the conqueror''

147
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:33,552
Rajput School is not only famous
for its high level of education.

148
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:37,724
A good education can be
obtained at any other place too.

149
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:41,722
The only difference is that
the boys of this school...

150
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:44,724
are taught to be
leaders in every field.

151
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:49,735
The proof of this is the
lnter School Sports shield.

152
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:58,772
The person chosen as the sports
captain this year is the young man...

153
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:01,677
who has taken the
responsibility ...

154
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:07,687
to win this shield.
He is Shekhar Malhotra.

155
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:20,364
l'm sure you will win it the third
time too and set a new record.

156
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:31,637
Who are the brave boys?
- Rajput!

157
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:36,244
Who are the leaders?
- Rajput!

158
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,123
Sanju...
- Yes, father?

159
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:49,763
Have you got your results?
- No, not yet.

160
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:56,303
You got your results a fortnight ago.
lt was under your pillow.

161
00:18:57,973 --> 00:19:00,498
Leave alone lying, you have
no regrets about failing.

162
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:03,438
You still keep loitering with
your good-for-nothing friends.

163
00:19:03,746 --> 00:19:06,340
Someone with dignity would have
had sleepless nights.

164
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:10,081
He would have found it
difficult to swallow food.

165
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:23,359
Shakur, let him go! He'll come
around when he's hungry.

166
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:28,501
Are you aware? Sanju,
Maksood and Ghanshyam ...

167
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:32,501
have failed again. And now, these
scoundrels will be in your class.

168
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:37,703
Why do you mingle with those loafers?
Aren't there nice girls in your class?

169
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:42,208
They talk nonsense.
- And they talk about high ideals!

170
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,116
Their language is horrible.

171
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:52,283
They abuse a lot and use
slang while speaking.

172
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:55,286
Wow! What language!

173
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:58,490
What do you want?

174
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:00,863
l wanted the newspaper, uncle.

175
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,429
Do you want the price of gold?
- Pardon me...?

176
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:08,833
lt is right there, take it.
... And bring me my wallet.

177
00:20:46,816 --> 00:20:49,751
Anjali, give me a napkin.

178
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:51,186
Coming.

179
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:13,308
Ratan...

180
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:17,475
Yes, father?
- Here's a new blazer for you.

181
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:21,580
You will be receiving an award today,
so don't wear the old one.

182
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:22,851
Yes father.

183
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:26,716
Take this money.
- That's not necessary.

184
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:30,619
Keep it, and don't forget to
pay respects to your mother.

185
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,188
l will.

186
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:38,462
Ratan, your new blazer looks great.
- lsn't it good?

187
00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:43,729
Ratan, l want Rs.50.
- Do you want to buy books?

188
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,969
Aren't you giving it to me?
- No.

189
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,772
Did you see that?
Ratan gets a new blazer...

190
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:55,775
as well as money and
l don't get anything.

191
00:21:57,786 --> 00:21:59,617
lt happens with me always.

192
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:05,126
Take a look at my shoes
... They're torn.

193
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:13,129
Sanju, do you need money?

194
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,361
Do you have any?
- How much do you want?

195
00:22:18,574 --> 00:22:22,374
40... 50.
- l'll get it.

196
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:29,582
You, idiot! You are taking
advantage of her feelings?

197
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:35,346
Nonsense! She is my good friend
and cares about me, unlike you.

198
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:42,386
Ramlal's efforts are
the sole reason...

199
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:45,723
behind the fine performance
by Pradip Kumar, Afzal Khan...

200
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:47,793
and Ratanlal of our school.

201
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:52,731
And Ratanlal came second
in the marathon cycle race.

202
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:57,406
For this achievement, he is awarded
the school champion badge.

203
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:11,388
This is your final year, Ratan.
This time you must come first.

204
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:13,556
l'll try my best.

205
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:43,691
''He is called as a
conqueror, friends...''

206
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:51,457
''he who knows how to win
a losing battle''

207
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:56,404
''The day we come into the
field euphoric...''

208
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:59,373
''we will conquer with
a victory''

209
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:25,656
''Why should we go along
with the world?''

210
00:24:26,168 --> 00:24:29,535
''Why should we kill ourselves
with exercise?''

211
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:33,135
''Why should we be scared of
parents or the teachers?''

212
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:35,443
''We are the conquerors here''

213
00:24:35,844 --> 00:24:38,813
''We can tackle with everyone''

214
00:24:39,848 --> 00:24:43,147
''Beware of us, my friends''

215
00:24:44,186 --> 00:24:47,314
''lf they don't
understand us''

216
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,958
''How does it matter
to us?

217
00:24:52,194 --> 00:24:57,655
''We know how to win a
losing battle''

218
00:25:50,185 --> 00:25:53,279
''These lanes are ours
as well as the roads''

219
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:57,386
''Why should we feel
scared?''

220
00:25:57,926 --> 00:26:01,089
''Any one messing with us...''

221
00:26:01,797 --> 00:26:04,231
''will get aside feeling scared''

222
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,700
''We are the conquerors here''

223
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:10,230
''We can tackle with
everyone''

224
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:14,502
''Don't mess with us
my dears''

225
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:19,105
''lf they don't understand us,''

226
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:21,279
''how does it matter
to us''

227
00:26:23,318 --> 00:26:28,813
''We know how to win
a losing battle''

228
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,579
''These beautiful innocent
angels''

229
00:27:25,314 --> 00:27:28,442
''Are all crazy for
wealth''

230
00:27:29,151 --> 00:27:32,712
''When they realise the
value of true love''

231
00:27:33,188 --> 00:27:35,748
''They will go crazy
about us''

232
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:38,122
''We are the conquerors here''

233
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,725
''We can tackle with
everyone''

234
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:45,731
''We also are no less
than any princes''

235
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:52,396
''lf they do not understand us,
how does it matter?''

236
00:27:54,843 --> 00:28:00,247
''We know how to win a
losing battle''

237
00:28:30,312 --> 00:28:32,746
Damn you ! Swine!

238
00:28:49,164 --> 00:28:51,462
Take a look at that boy.
He's eating nuts like a monkey.

239
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,201
He looks like one.
- Look at his antics.

240
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:56,532
What will you have?
- A cheese sandwich.

241
00:28:56,872 --> 00:28:58,464
2 cheese sandwiches.

242
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:01,072
Make it fast

243
00:29:04,146 --> 00:29:07,638
Sanju, make two milk shakes.
Ramu, make two cheese toasts.

244
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:09,083
Get up!

245
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:29,394
Look, he's giving it a try.

246
00:29:48,323 --> 00:29:50,791
l have a good mind
to hit them.

247
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:55,220
Now watch the charm of
Shekhar Malhotra.

248
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:06,140
Who doesn't know the
inter college champion?

249
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:20,353
We visited Sidney point today.
lt is a beautiful place.

250
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,851
Will you come along sometime?
- Sure.

251
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:30,898
Chilled.

252
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:34,828
He's too proud of
himself.

253
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,311
You've fetched the bottles but
forgotten the straws... Fool!

254
00:30:49,918 --> 00:30:51,886
He's got the intelligence
of a child.

255
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:15,308
lgnore them.
They are jealous of you.

256
00:31:15,811 --> 00:31:16,778
He panicked.

257
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,441
The Xavier's boys
are scoundrels.

258
00:31:55,383 --> 00:31:57,180
ldiot! What have you done!

259
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:22,128
How did this happen?

260
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:25,571
How, l ask!

261
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:29,776
The boys from Xavier's and Rajput had
a scuffle and they broke the furniture

262
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:35,748
By fighting over a couple
of girls from Queens college...

263
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:38,584
you have maligned the
reputation of Rajput college.

264
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:43,385
lf you have a goon-like tendency, you
should have joined a sleazy college.

265
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:49,794
And you, Shekhar,...
The captain of this college...

266
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:53,800
Weren't you ashamed of
quarreling at an ordinary cafe?

267
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,700
Sir, it was my fault.
lt won't occur again.

268
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:59,669
lf it occurs again, you
will be suspended. All of you.

269
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,716
You will not be allowed to
leave the hostel for two weeks.

270
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,531
Stop it, Sanju.

271
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,536
Did you speak to the
Principal of Rajput College?

272
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,139
Yes. Damage was done to us but
they weren't sufficiently punished.

273
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:39,804
Go and complain some more.
- Why were you jealous?

274
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:42,840
Was it because a Rajput boy...
easily charmed a girl from Queens.

275
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:46,583
What nonsense! l don't care
about such cheap girls.

276
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:48,651
As if they care about you.

277
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:53,656
My dear brother,

278
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:59,763
a girl who could knock me out of my
senses, hasn't stepped on earth as yet

279
00:35:25,326 --> 00:35:29,456
Who is the new girl?
- Spoilt brat of a rich father, maybe.

280
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:00,520
Hey! Are you blind?

281
00:36:07,135 --> 00:36:08,568
He's gone.

282
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:12,306
Look at him.

283
00:36:26,688 --> 00:36:28,451
They are asking for trouble.

284
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:30,450
2 chocolate milk shakes.

285
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,620
Hi Rina, How are you?
- Who are you?

286
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:40,357
l'm Ganshu. Have you forgotten?
We met in Delhi at the market.

287
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:44,464
We were having snacks.
Don't you remember, Rina?

288
00:36:44,806 --> 00:36:46,774
My name is not Rina, but Tina.

289
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:52,146
What will you have, Tina?

290
00:36:55,717 --> 00:36:57,844
Or, will you have Chikoo?
lt is great...

291
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,691
We won't do it again !

292
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:14,097
The old woman has a firm hand.
She has skinned me.

293
00:37:18,173 --> 00:37:21,336
Aren't you new? l thought
l'd accompany you.

294
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:30,444
The boys in blue coats are from Rajput
college. They're from affluent families

295
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:33,253
The boys in red blazers
are from Xavier's.

296
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:37,587
And those boys in
green blazers?

297
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:43,593
Don't even look at them.
They are from Model College.

298
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:47,824
They are trash.
We call them jerks.

299
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,735
Jerks?
- Yes, dear.

300
00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:55,404
They are jerks who
look like hungry wolves.

301
00:37:57,378 --> 00:38:02,475
l have decided never to give girls
from Queens college a ride.

302
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:06,618
Hey... who is she?

303
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,246
Wow!
- O Lord!

304
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:55,301
Boys are dropping dead.
Should l call the ambulance?

305
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:06,770
The yellow headband... who is he?
- Shekhar Malhotra,

306
00:39:07,282 --> 00:39:10,149
inter college champion.
He is J.K.Malhotra's son.

307
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:12,583
The owner of Malhotra
Steel Mills?

308
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:18,622
There is no girl worth knowing.
- Neither is your Richa around.

309
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:23,695
What did you do the last time?
- Nothing, just a kiss.

310
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:27,657
A good night kiss!
Your kiss is sufficient.

311
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:36,642
Who is that girl?

312
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:45,343
She must be new.

313
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:51,349
Seated beside her is Ruksana,
from Queens, who always says 'dear'.

314
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:03,327
She is impressed.

315
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:07,831
Hey!
...He's gone.

316
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:13,745
The swine!
...He's gone to prey.

317
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:22,154
Do you know me?
- Who doesn't?

318
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:55,515
Scoundrel!
Why are you laughing?

319
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,450
lt angers me, that a
rogue is fooling a naive girl.

320
00:40:58,826 --> 00:41:01,522
One ought to tell her that
Shekhar was dating Richa.

321
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:05,321
Don't worry, Sanju. l'll take her
aside and explain everything .

322
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:08,131
Even l can take her aside in
the corner if it is necessary.

323
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:13,805
Everyone has a corner
but no one has a girl friend.

324
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,538
Hey...l'll hit you !
- Get lost!

325
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,426
This is insolence!
- Will you complain about this too?

326
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:14,792
l don't have the time for this
bickering. We are here to train.

327
00:42:16,704 --> 00:42:20,538
Whose training?
... Are these your champions?

328
00:42:20,842 --> 00:42:23,470
And take a look at
this bag of bones.

329
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:31,713
Look Paunchy,
there's no need to be angry.

330
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:34,848
As for the cycle race,
l'm the champion around here.

331
00:42:35,923 --> 00:42:38,483
No local boy can beat me!

332
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:42,490
And l shall win the race
this year too...

333
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:44,822
and blacken the
faces of these scoundrels.

334
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:49,169
You're a scoundrel! Your family is full
of scoundrels! l'll break your face.

335
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:53,363
l'll break your face.
- Why are you fighting with them?

336
00:42:56,978 --> 00:43:01,745
Hey fighter, pay heed to your dad.
Else you'll be severely beaten.

337
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,520
Let's disperse.

338
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:23,563
Uncle, l've brought
a vegetable dish.

339
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:26,673
l have already eaten.
They will have it.

340
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:29,604
Sanju, will you have some?

341
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:35,315
l won't spare them.

342
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:39,284
Why are you kicking up a storm?
Forget about what happened.

343
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:42,852
How can l?
You are afraid of them.

344
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:47,487
They insulted father and
you kept mum! You are gutless.

345
00:43:47,828 --> 00:43:50,820
l am not afraid of anyone.
- Then, why did you keep mum?

346
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:54,791
Violence is not the solution.
- Neither is submission.

347
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:59,430
Sanju is right. We ought
to give them a fit reply.

348
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:04,235
l spared them because of father.
Next time l won't spare them.

349
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:10,215
What will you do?
You talk utter rubbish.

350
00:44:12,853 --> 00:44:18,120
Shekhar is proud and very ill-mannered.
Ratan will break his pride.

351
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:22,526
Ratan, l have decided to buy
an imported cycle for you.

352
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:27,327
But father, an imported cycle costs
around 12 to 15 thousand rupees.

353
00:44:28,336 --> 00:44:32,739
lt's alright. l'll save every penny,
and l'll even borrow if l have to.

354
00:44:33,574 --> 00:44:37,442
Didn't he say that no
local boy could beat him?

355
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:41,781
This year, he will not win but
leave in defeat at your hands.

356
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:58,757
Where did you go with Shekhar?
- Nowhere in particular.

357
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,293
What did you do?
- We had a casual conversation.

358
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:04,432
Did anything interesting happen?
- That will take place tomorrow.

359
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:06,798
But we're going to Sidney point
on a school picnic tomorrow.

360
00:45:09,277 --> 00:45:11,711
ls Shekhar coming there?
- Yes. He said that...

361
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:15,707
he would fling himself from
Sidney point if l'm not there.

362
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:29,527
Deposit this Rs 1000 in the bank.
- Alright, father.

363
00:45:29,797 --> 00:45:31,765
l'm off to Mr.Dube's place
and l'll have my meal there.

364
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:38,466
Ramu, return these empty crates
to the soft drink delivery man...

365
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:40,832
and take delivery of
4 crates of soft drinks.

366
00:45:41,709 --> 00:45:43,677
l'll settle the accounts
when l return.

367
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:47,443
Sanju, put this
bread in the oven.

368
00:45:51,786 --> 00:45:54,846
Take this. l'm going to the bank.
- l'll go to the bank instead.

369
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:57,357
Father has directed me
to go to the bank.

370
00:46:06,734 --> 00:46:08,565
Kalpana... hi.
- Hello Ratan

371
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:11,104
Do you need something?
- l need some bread?

372
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,504
Bread...? Take a seat.
No, it's alright.

373
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:15,776
Please sit.

374
00:46:18,145 --> 00:46:20,113
l'll bake some fresh
bread and get it for you.

375
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,816
Sanju, go to the bank.
l'll bake the bread.

376
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,812
No, you go to the bank and l'll
bake the bread for Kalpana.

377
00:46:29,323 --> 00:46:31,120
Don't act smart.

378
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,453
All right...
But take my advice.

379
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:40,122
Grab her and give her a kiss.

380
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,566
Come on friends,
it's too hot out here.

381
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:48,842
''They spoke with their eyes''

382
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,141
''And found life partners''

383
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:57,316
Oh,... The bread!

384
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,717
Hey! What are you doing?

385
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:08,687
This is Mr.Wadia's car. lf he comes
to know, l'll be in trouble.

386
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,757
Damn Wadia.

387
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:19,635
Just a moment. l'll go
and buy some flowers.

388
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,807
Hurry up!

389
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:39,255
Hey, what are you doing!
Where are you going? Stop! ldiots!

390
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:56,137
Stop!

391
00:47:58,312 --> 00:48:00,405
What luck! They are three
and we are also three.

392
00:48:01,816 --> 00:48:03,784
The one in the centre is mine.
- Ganshu,

393
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:06,584
hop over to the store
and pick up three cigarettes.

394
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:09,084
The girls will be
impressed with our style.

395
00:48:09,824 --> 00:48:13,089
You have brains!
- Get filter cigarettes.

396
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:14,394
All right.

397
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:20,128
Ghode, fetch some mint, too.
- Why?

398
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:24,699
When you approach them,
your breath will smell fresh.

399
00:48:25,673 --> 00:48:26,640
Go.

400
00:48:53,868 --> 00:48:55,665
Please stop!

401
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:01,741
Please don't be angry. l've missed my
school bus. l got to go to Sidney Point

402
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:04,768
lf l don't reach there, there
could be a great problem.

403
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:21,561
l am Devika.
- And l am Sanjaylal.

404
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,867
Yes.

405
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,364
lnstead of your picnic, come
along to Mallroad for a coffee.

406
00:50:06,674 --> 00:50:08,301
Some other time, perhaps.

407
00:51:14,174 --> 00:51:16,438
You mentioned something
about a coffee.

408
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:35,726
There's a boy who is running
like crazy. ls he calling to you?

409
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:38,460
No.
- Devika, listen to me.

410
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,308
Sanjay considers himself
to be very smart.

411
00:51:52,846 --> 00:51:56,873
l'll make him pay for the cigarettes.
And why did you have to get off?

412
00:51:57,384 --> 00:52:00,444
He asked me to fetch mint.
- Shut up! Don't you have any brains?

413
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:02,122
What?

414
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:08,487
Greetings, sir!
- Greetings.

415
00:52:08,862 --> 00:52:10,295
So you know me, eh?

416
00:52:10,564 --> 00:52:15,331
Who doesn't know you, sir! You
are the lord of this village.

417
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:19,796
Oh, all right!
... Do you have matches?

418
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,832
Offer the matches to the lady.

419
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:27,145
How are your cattle?
- lt is all your grace, sir.

420
00:52:28,182 --> 00:52:31,743
Bad crops this year, l hear.
- There's been no rain...

421
00:52:32,186 --> 00:52:36,486
and we have no money and...
- Oh... keep this.

422
00:52:39,893 --> 00:52:40,860
Share it.

423
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:43,854
Thank you, sir.
- You are welcome.

424
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:45,320
Thank you, madam.

425
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:52,168
Enjoy yourself...At last
your wish has been granted.

426
00:52:52,906 --> 00:52:53,873
Come along.

427
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,274
Hey! ls my Mercedes ready?
- No, sir.

428
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:07,679
Oh, no!
Where is your father?

429
00:53:08,155 --> 00:53:10,623
He has gone to the police
station to file a report.

430
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,151
A thief stole one of our cars.
lt was similar to yours.

431
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:18,124
lt is a green Maruti Gypsy.

432
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:23,794
What a state this country has come to!
Devika, l hate thieves.

433
00:53:47,361 --> 00:53:49,852
lt's a small place
but the coffee is great.

434
00:54:04,178 --> 00:54:05,509
Hey! Come here.

435
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:12,250
Fetch 2 cups of
special coffee and...

436
00:54:20,861 --> 00:54:23,659
What happened?
- There's a problem with the chair.

437
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,596
Hey! Change your chairs.

438
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,863
What did he want?
- He's placed a tall order.

439
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:34,363
Who will pay for it?
- No one.

440
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,278
Have some.

441
00:54:40,881 --> 00:54:42,143
These pastries
are really good.

442
00:54:43,884 --> 00:54:45,715
Look! lt's those jerks again.

443
00:54:51,191 --> 00:54:53,716
Greetings, sir!
... Greetings, madam!

444
00:54:54,194 --> 00:54:55,684
Hello!

445
00:54:57,197 --> 00:55:02,100
We were passing through...
- So we decided to pay you a visit.

446
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:05,567
We were famished and
... all our money was stolen.

447
00:55:06,373 --> 00:55:08,341
Serve them too.

448
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:11,167
Thank you, sir.
We won't forget your favour.

449
00:55:11,845 --> 00:55:13,506
Let's make ourselves at home.

450
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:17,112
Hey, waiter!
Give us 3 menu cards.

451
00:55:24,191 --> 00:55:28,127
Did you really come for coffee
or to make someone jealous?

452
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:34,127
Do you know Shekhar?

453
00:55:35,202 --> 00:55:38,831
Yes, and l also know that he'd
called you to Sidney point today

454
00:55:42,876 --> 00:55:45,674
Yesterday, l overheard
Shekhar talking to his friends.

455
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,145
He mentioned that it took him a while
to woo Kamla, Bimla and Richa.

456
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:53,378
But Devika readily
dropped into his lap.

457
00:55:55,322 --> 00:55:56,789
He's a liar!

458
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:05,289
Richa is from Queens College,
but who are Kamla and Bimla?

459
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:10,496
They were from Sitaram college.
They returned home.

460
00:56:10,904 --> 00:56:11,871
Why?

461
00:56:14,141 --> 00:56:18,601
They were cheated.
- What happened?

462
00:56:19,846 --> 00:56:21,711
How can l tell you?
- Please tell me.

463
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:30,521
This is what happened to them.

464
00:56:37,264 --> 00:56:39,528
That must be it.

465
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,297
l hear that it's
Shekhar's old habit.

466
00:56:45,772 --> 00:56:48,206
l'll teach him a lesson
that he'll never forget.

467
00:56:48,508 --> 00:56:51,705
l'll seek revenge on him
for insulting me today.

468
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:53,146
How?

469
00:56:53,814 --> 00:56:55,543
Will you help me?

470
00:57:00,187 --> 00:57:04,351
Shall l contact you at Xavier's?
- Yes... No!

471
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:06,749
l share my name with a
couple of scoundrels.

472
00:57:07,227 --> 00:57:11,095
Then?
- There's another number... 202.

473
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:19,105
Add my bill to my account.

474
00:57:20,273 --> 00:57:22,332
Thank you, sir.
... Madam!

475
00:57:23,844 --> 00:57:25,641
Waiter, fetch us 3 menus.

476
00:57:29,316 --> 00:57:32,342
Get lost!
- l'll pay you Rs 100, smartass!

477
00:57:42,229 --> 00:57:43,787
She's walking on air since
the time she met Shekhar.

478
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:46,598
She'll come to her senses when
she becomes like this.

479
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,239
ls Shekhar really like
that, dear?

480
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:57,666
And who is Sanju?
- Xavier's boy.

481
00:57:58,879 --> 00:58:03,282
l have befriended Sanju,
to seek revenge on Shekhar.

482
00:58:03,617 --> 00:58:06,780
l don't want a romantic involvement.
- So, Sanju is a nobody?

483
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:11,652
He is not a nobody. Any boy who gives
a tip of Rs 200...

484
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:14,685
for a match, is surely somebody.

485
00:58:16,863 --> 00:58:19,491
Rs 100! Who gave it to you?
- Sanju.

486
00:58:19,866 --> 00:58:22,096
And Sanju took it back.
- Hey, give it back!

487
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:24,496
This belongs to father and l
have to return it to him.

488
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:27,672
Hey! What would happen if
l told Devika the truth?

489
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:30,575
She would have left.
l didn't want to befriend her.

490
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:33,210
l wanted to seek revenge on
Shekhar, which l have done.

491
00:58:56,169 --> 00:58:58,262
2 plates of samosas please.
- Yes, sir.

492
00:59:04,644 --> 00:59:05,633
lt's blank.

493
00:59:17,824 --> 00:59:21,089
Dear Ratan.

494
00:59:38,845 --> 00:59:42,110
Why didn't you return the chit
that fell from Kalpana's books?

495
00:59:43,283 --> 00:59:47,515
lt bore your name.
- My name?... where is it?

496
00:59:48,822 --> 00:59:51,518
The letter will cost Rs 20
- What!

497
00:59:52,192 --> 00:59:56,322
All right. Give me Rs 10.
- l won't give a single penny.

498
00:59:58,865 --> 01:00:01,732
All right.
l'm off.

499
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:07,140
Come here.

500
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:13,476
Here's a tenner.

501
01:00:14,214 --> 01:00:17,479
This is your Diwali gift.
And l'm not interested in the letter.

502
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:24,721
Take this... don't hesitate.
- l told you, l don't want it.

503
01:00:25,892 --> 01:00:28,554
Read. Might contain something special.
- Get lost.

504
01:00:36,903 --> 01:00:38,165
Dear Ratan,

505
01:00:38,905 --> 01:00:43,865
l don't know what has come over me.
l've been dreaming about you.

506
01:00:44,878 --> 01:00:46,505
Tonight is Diwali.

507
01:00:46,813 --> 01:00:50,374
All the boys and girls will
be gathered at the courtyard.

508
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:54,844
lf you come holding a red
rose in your hand,...

509
01:00:55,355 --> 01:00:58,847
l will assume that you love me too.
With love from Kalpana.

510
01:01:16,676 --> 01:01:20,703
Nazima, come here.
Give Kalpana this letter...

511
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:23,149
and tell her that it is from Ratan.
- Okay

512
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:27,153
Kalpana, this is from Ratan.

513
01:01:30,223 --> 01:01:33,420
Dear Kalpana, l don't know
what has come over me.

514
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:35,718
l've been dreaming about you.

515
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:38,824
Tonight you will surely
come to the courtyard.

516
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:43,862
And if you carry a red rose,
l will assume that you love me too.

517
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:46,498
With love from Ratan.

518
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:08,794
All the boys here are crazy
about the girls from Queens.

519
01:02:09,262 --> 01:02:12,493
And those girls don't even
given them a second glance.

520
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,734
Even we ought to do the same.
All boys are the same.

521
01:02:16,169 --> 01:02:17,898
lf you express your feelings,
they don't care.

522
01:02:18,305 --> 01:02:20,569
And if you play hard to get,
they come after you.

523
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:24,833
ls that so?
- Yes, of course. Try it and see.

524
01:02:25,312 --> 01:02:27,143
Who is your mule?

525
01:02:31,451 --> 01:02:33,442
Whose did you steal?
- Shut up...

526
01:02:34,854 --> 01:02:35,821
Take this.

527
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,487
Look over there.

528
01:02:50,837 --> 01:02:52,498
Let's tease him.

529
01:02:56,376 --> 01:02:59,504
Why are you holding a red rose?
Let me see.

530
01:02:59,813 --> 01:03:01,713
Let's see.
- lt's deep red!

531
01:03:02,182 --> 01:03:03,444
lt's a rose.

532
01:03:04,751 --> 01:03:06,810
Hey, look there! Kalpana
is also holding a red rose.

533
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,652
ls something going on?

534
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,517
He has improved.

535
01:03:12,926 --> 01:03:15,827
l'll call Anjali over, surely
Kalpana will accompany her.

536
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:18,594
Don't you want to speak to her?
- l don't want to speak to anyone.

537
01:03:18,865 --> 01:03:20,799
Hang on ! lt will be fun.

538
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:23,132
Anjali, come here!

539
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:24,837
Refuse.

540
01:03:29,843 --> 01:03:32,812
Tell him to get lost.
- Get lost!

541
01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:40,285
Acting smart, eh?
Come here!

542
01:03:40,787 --> 01:03:42,311
Hold your ground.

543
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:45,382
You come here, you pigeon.

544
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:52,854
Hey, why can't you listen?

545
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:29,130
''Those who are crazy after the
girls of this city''

546
01:04:31,571 --> 01:04:37,669
''What can they know about
our elegance...''

547
01:04:42,482 --> 01:04:44,450
''you disloyal sweetheart''

548
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:52,386
''The one who doesn't
realize..''

549
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:56,326
''Who l'm crazy about''

550
01:04:56,896 --> 01:05:00,354
''What can she understand about''

551
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,098
''the style of my amorousness''

552
01:05:07,841 --> 01:05:09,706
''Understand me, my love''

553
01:05:42,175 --> 01:05:45,576
''There may be many beauties,
but we are no less''

554
01:05:45,912 --> 01:05:48,745
''Have a proper look
at us''

555
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:53,317
''Don't be so boastful
it can be that..''

556
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:57,414
''ultimately you might
land up no where''

557
01:05:57,857 --> 01:06:04,228
''Those who are crazy after the
the girls of the city...''

558
01:06:05,798 --> 01:06:11,100
''What can they know about
our elegance...''

559
01:06:16,843 --> 01:06:18,811
''you disloyal sweetheart''

560
01:06:26,419 --> 01:06:27,386
''Come here''

561
01:06:30,523 --> 01:06:32,787
''No, no!
- Come into my arms, ''

562
01:06:33,226 --> 01:06:35,285
''don't go away''
- Never''

563
01:07:15,134 --> 01:07:18,592
''Many have gone crazy''

564
01:07:19,138 --> 01:07:22,164
''You can't escape either''

565
01:07:23,142 --> 01:07:26,543
''Hearing my plea...
with all style''

566
01:07:26,846 --> 01:07:30,247
''will come running
towards me''

567
01:07:30,817 --> 01:07:34,184
''The one who doesn't
realize''

568
01:07:34,821 --> 01:07:37,722
''Whom l'm crazy about''

569
01:07:38,758 --> 01:07:44,458
''What can she understand about
the style of my amorousness''

570
01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:51,598
''Understand, my love''

571
01:07:52,305 --> 01:07:59,143
''Those who are crazy after the
girls of this city''

572
01:07:59,946 --> 01:08:05,475
''What'd they know about the elegance
of our simplicity?''

573
01:08:11,124 --> 01:08:13,092
''My disloyal sweetheart''

574
01:08:14,827 --> 01:08:16,658
''Try and understand
sweetheart''

575
01:08:26,906 --> 01:08:30,706
Tonight, Sanju sat beside me
long after everyone had left.

576
01:08:32,145 --> 01:08:34,113
He seemed as though he
wanted to say something.

577
01:08:34,681 --> 01:08:38,811
l thought l'd say it myself
that you mean everything to me.

578
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:46,124
Numskull, how can l
explain to you?

579
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:02,270
Devika, please listen l have
nothing to do with Richa.

580
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:05,309
ln fact, l was fooling her.

581
01:09:05,778 --> 01:09:07,507
Like Kamla and Bimla?

582
01:09:07,914 --> 01:09:09,882
Anyway, why did you call?

583
01:09:11,184 --> 01:09:15,245
Devika, l'd like to meet
you alone some place.

584
01:09:15,822 --> 01:09:17,722
Like Kamla and Bimla?
- What!

585
01:09:18,124 --> 01:09:20,820
Never mind that! l'm coming
to Mallroad today.

586
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,760
Where exactly?
- Ahead of Mallroad there...

587
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:28,223
is a road going uphill.
A tree bearing yellow flowers.

588
01:09:29,836 --> 01:09:33,101
Wait for me at 5 p.m.
beneath that tree.

589
01:09:41,848 --> 01:09:43,577
Who are you calling now?

590
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:55,726
Who is Sanjay?
- Hey! Give it to me.

591
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:04,564
Yes, Devika. Go on.
- l have an appointment...

592
01:10:04,871 --> 01:10:08,272
with Shekhar at 5 this evening.
Could you come to Mallroad at 4 pm?

593
01:10:09,575 --> 01:10:11,736
You will have to come
there with some supplies.

594
01:10:12,178 --> 01:10:13,145
Sure.

595
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:19,682
A long rope... 2 buckets.

596
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:22,616
And... what?

597
01:10:25,925 --> 01:10:27,654
All right, l'll be there.

598
01:10:39,906 --> 01:10:41,874
What are you looking at?
- The necklace in the centre.

599
01:10:42,341 --> 01:10:43,831
lsn't it beautiful?
- Yes.

600
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:46,804
lt costs Rs 4000.
- So ? l'll get it for you.

601
01:10:47,914 --> 01:10:49,711
Why are you sweet talking me?

602
01:10:50,349 --> 01:10:53,648
Mr Thapar's car is at
your garage.

603
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,619
And l have to return it today.
- Correct. l could take it to him...

604
01:10:58,925 --> 01:11:02,224
and get it back under some pretext.
We could go for a drive in the evening

605
01:11:02,662 --> 01:11:05,825
Good idea. But what will we do
if Thapar keeps the car?

606
01:11:06,299 --> 01:11:09,291
Wait and see. l'll
get around him.

607
01:11:24,217 --> 01:11:27,618
Add the fresh one too.
- All right.

608
01:11:28,988 --> 01:11:29,818
Here...

609
01:12:12,198 --> 01:12:14,723
My stomach is hurting.

610
01:12:15,234 --> 01:12:19,364
Shekhar, why have
you brought us along?

611
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:23,534
l'll look like a fool if l
stand alone beneath this tree.

612
01:12:23,843 --> 01:12:25,834
So you want all of us
to look like fools, eh?

613
01:12:26,312 --> 01:12:27,677
As you wish.

614
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:50,566
Well?
- What?

615
01:12:55,908 --> 01:12:57,705
Take him somewhere.
- This fellow.

616
01:12:58,678 --> 01:13:00,270
Go, get some relief.

617
01:13:26,339 --> 01:13:28,307
Devika!
There's someone with her.

618
01:13:30,409 --> 01:13:32,138
l won't spare him.

619
01:14:17,957 --> 01:14:20,323
Why are you hitting me?
Help!

620
01:14:57,363 --> 01:14:58,728
We missed him!

621
01:15:03,836 --> 01:15:06,600
Where have you brought me?
- This is my house.

622
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,108
ls this your house?

623
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:15,113
l'll go and tell father
that l'm going out.

624
01:16:26,218 --> 01:16:28,345
Sir, l have brought your car
from Girdhari Garage.

625
01:16:28,921 --> 01:16:30,582
Give the keys and leave.

626
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:35,557
The engine is knocking. Shall
l take it back and repair it?

627
01:16:35,895 --> 01:16:38,523
You bring back the car after 10
days and it's still not ready!

628
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:44,359
Commissioner, the
locals are thieves.

629
01:16:44,837 --> 01:16:47,465
When they take the car to
the garage they keep it.

630
01:17:04,657 --> 01:17:07,091
l know how to deal
with the likes of you.

631
01:17:07,927 --> 01:17:09,895
Randhir, take the keys from him
and throw him out.

632
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:11,558
Give the keys.

633
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,109
Sanjay, your house
is very impressive.

634
01:17:27,146 --> 01:17:28,807
Was your father angry?

635
01:17:30,849 --> 01:17:33,716
He was angry because l
was late for the party.

636
01:17:36,222 --> 01:17:40,249
l tossed the car keys in anger,
l'll have to drop you in taxi.

637
01:17:46,832 --> 01:17:49,130
Your father appears to
be very hot tempered.

638
01:17:50,669 --> 01:17:55,129
So am l. Someday, l shall leave
this house and his wealth.

639
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:07,084
Devika, if l didn't have
any of this wealth,...

640
01:18:08,787 --> 01:18:09,754
would you...

641
01:18:10,823 --> 01:18:11,790
What?

642
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:14,285
Nothing.

643
01:18:14,793 --> 01:18:18,092
Sanjay, l know what
you're trying to say.

644
01:18:18,831 --> 01:18:21,766
Would you believe me
if l told you something?

645
01:18:22,835 --> 01:18:23,802
Go ahead.

646
01:18:25,504 --> 01:18:29,270
Sanjay, when l first met you,
l didn't know who you were.

647
01:18:30,142 --> 01:18:34,442
But it seemed as though
l had been waiting for you.

648
01:18:35,848 --> 01:18:39,113
lt is the truth, Sanjay.
l do not care for money.

649
01:18:39,852 --> 01:18:41,513
Even if you don't have
anything in the future...

650
01:18:41,854 --> 01:18:43,754
you'll mean the same to me.

651
01:18:52,298 --> 01:18:55,859
This is my memento.
You might forget me in the future,

652
01:18:56,335 --> 01:18:58,132
but l shall never forget you.

653
01:19:06,912 --> 01:19:09,642
l will have to solder it.
lt will take 5 to 10 minutes.

654
01:19:10,115 --> 01:19:11,776
All right.
- l'll be back soon.

655
01:19:20,526 --> 01:19:22,494
Give it to me.
- What happened?

656
01:19:26,298 --> 01:19:30,758
What is it?
- l'm on fire. The flame of love.

657
01:19:35,441 --> 01:19:37,102
Why are you being so dramatic?

658
01:19:46,285 --> 01:19:49,254
ls it gold?
- Yes.

659
01:19:50,155 --> 01:19:54,114
Someone has given it to me with
trembling hands and a throbbing heart.

660
01:19:55,828 --> 01:20:00,128
Who?
- Devika.

661
01:20:00,566 --> 01:20:02,295
Never! You are lying

662
01:20:05,838 --> 01:20:09,365
Big brother, you are the
heavy muscular type.

663
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:12,639
A heavy model like you,
wouldn't understand love.

664
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:22,143
Cut the crap. Tell me,
have you told her anything?

665
01:20:22,421 --> 01:20:24,184
No. Not as yet.

666
01:20:24,823 --> 01:20:26,848
Therein lies the problem.
lt's difficult to say anything.

667
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:30,294
lt is not difficult. All you
need to do is take a decision.

668
01:20:30,696 --> 01:20:34,291
Have you come to a decision?
- Yes, of course.

669
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,496
What will you say?
- What is there to say?

670
01:20:37,903 --> 01:20:43,773
l'll hold her hand like this, look
into her eyes and say, l love you.

671
01:20:45,778 --> 01:20:48,747
Ganshu, Ghode, listen to me.
- Not now.

672
01:20:49,214 --> 01:20:51,910
lt's something special.
- My father will kick my butt.

673
01:20:54,253 --> 01:20:57,381
l've soldered it, but is it
okay if l fix it tomorrow?

674
01:20:57,823 --> 01:20:59,791
All right, l'll come for
it tomorrow.

675
01:21:06,832 --> 01:21:09,528
Hi Anjali, l was on my way to see you.
- Really!

676
01:21:09,868 --> 01:21:12,166
Let's sit here.
- Anjali, come home soon.

677
01:21:13,338 --> 01:21:14,305
Yes, father.

678
01:21:16,308 --> 01:21:21,143
Oh yes, l couldn't bring the car back.
Thapar made mince meat of me.

679
01:21:21,713 --> 01:21:23,340
l knew that.

680
01:21:28,987 --> 01:21:31,353
Anjali, l want to
tell you something.

681
01:21:32,891 --> 01:21:34,825
lt's something special.
- Go on.

682
01:21:39,364 --> 01:21:44,267
l don't know how to say it. You might
wonder at the sudden change in Sanju.

683
01:21:45,871 --> 01:21:47,702
You won't laugh at me,
will you?

684
01:21:55,914 --> 01:21:57,643
The fact is...

685
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:04,115
Anjali, serve dinner.
- l'll be there.

686
01:22:10,295 --> 01:22:11,421
Go on, Sanju.

687
01:22:13,165 --> 01:22:16,328
No, not right now. We'll go
and speak in privacy tomorrow.

688
01:22:20,839 --> 01:22:23,239
''Whether you say it or not...''

689
01:22:24,243 --> 01:22:26,211
''but l have already heard it''

690
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:32,310
''You have chosen me as
your soulmate in love''

691
01:22:33,886 --> 01:22:36,377
''You have chosen me...''

692
01:22:36,889 --> 01:22:39,357
''and l have already heard it''

693
01:23:05,851 --> 01:23:09,446
''The first euphoria
and the ecstasy...''

694
01:23:11,857 --> 01:23:15,520
''The love is afresh,
and so is the await''

695
01:23:17,162 --> 01:23:22,122
''What should l do
oh my love lorn heart''

696
01:23:23,235 --> 01:23:27,228
''Oh my love lorn heart,
you only tell me''

697
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:17,254
''l'm flying high
in these euphoric winds''

698
01:24:17,823 --> 01:24:22,522
''Or should l swing with
these clouds''

699
01:24:23,528 --> 01:24:28,124
''Or should l get the
sky and the earth together''

700
01:24:29,534 --> 01:24:33,470
''Tell me friends what to
do and what not to do''

701
01:24:36,174 --> 01:24:39,769
''The first euphoria and
the ecstasy...''

702
01:25:42,407 --> 01:25:47,367
''He spoke to me in
such a manner that..''

703
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:53,277
''he gave me the
colourful dreams of love''

704
01:25:53,985 --> 01:25:57,716
''As is l remain helpless''

705
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:04,094
''And he kisses me
with all his love''

706
01:26:06,832 --> 01:26:10,359
''The first euphoria
and the ecstasy''

707
01:26:12,804 --> 01:26:16,501
''The love is afresh and
so is the await''

708
01:26:17,943 --> 01:26:20,844
''What should l do...''

709
01:26:21,513 --> 01:26:26,109
''oh my lovelorn heart''

710
01:26:42,968 --> 01:26:46,495
Keep this as my memento.
You might forget me in the future,

711
01:26:46,872 --> 01:26:48,840
but l shall never forget you.

712
01:26:50,408 --> 01:26:52,137
Sanju...
- Yes, father.

713
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:58,145
Deposit this Rs.5000 in the bank.
- Yes, father.

714
01:27:03,255 --> 01:27:05,086
What are you looking at, Anjali?

715
01:27:06,124 --> 01:27:08,684
There was a lovely pearl necklace here.
- lt is sold.

716
01:27:09,127 --> 01:27:11,687
Ramlal's son Sanjay bought it
this morning.

717
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:14,257
Do you wanting anything else?
- No, thank you.

718
01:27:16,234 --> 01:27:18,498
What happened?
- Sanju is crazy.

719
01:27:18,804 --> 01:27:22,672
There was a necklace here. l said that
l liked it so he got it for me.

720
01:27:23,141 --> 01:27:25,541
So, what?
- No, it is very expensive.

721
01:27:25,844 --> 01:27:29,803
l don't want such an expensive gift.
l'll get Sanju to return it.

722
01:27:31,183 --> 01:27:34,675
Ratan, have you seen Sanju?
- l saw him heading for sunset point.

723
01:29:12,329 --> 01:29:15,196
Sanju, wake up!
We have to go for practice.

724
01:29:15,466 --> 01:29:17,457
Let go of me!
- Get up!

725
01:29:18,803 --> 01:29:21,465
All right, l'm up.
- Come quickly.

726
01:29:38,856 --> 01:29:40,483
Where are the rest?

727
01:29:44,395 --> 01:29:46,295
Sanju is here too!

728
01:29:47,531 --> 01:29:49,795
lf he comes once, he takes
a break for several days.

729
01:29:51,035 --> 01:29:54,266
Have you taken the full round today?
- One hour 10 minutes.

730
01:29:55,606 --> 01:30:00,202
lf this was the race,
l would have won it.

731
01:30:00,845 --> 01:30:05,976
You would have won it last year.
But Shekhar forged ahead

732
01:30:06,884 --> 01:30:09,409
lt is the last few seconds that
decide the defeat and victory.

733
01:30:10,554 --> 01:30:13,284
Whatever it may be,
everyone believes that...

734
01:30:13,557 --> 01:30:16,822
only you can defeat
Shekhar.

735
01:30:17,528 --> 01:30:21,487
lt's true.
- Hopes can make a person nervous.

736
01:30:23,234 --> 01:30:28,228
Especially father. He keeps dreaming
of my victory and Shekhar's defeat.

737
01:30:30,674 --> 01:30:32,835
He wants to buy an
ltalian cycle for me.

738
01:30:33,878 --> 01:30:36,369
lt costs Rs.20,000.
- 20,000?

739
01:30:40,551 --> 01:30:46,217
l fear that if l don't win,
father will heartbroken.

740
01:31:12,249 --> 01:31:14,410
This training is very good.
We ought to take it too.

741
01:31:15,853 --> 01:31:18,822
Okay! With such training,
you'll surely beat Shekhar.

742
01:31:19,857 --> 01:31:21,825
We have seen nothing.
You may continue.

743
01:31:28,933 --> 01:31:30,992
Sanju meets me
very rarely these days.

744
01:31:31,502 --> 01:31:34,164
Perhaps he only remembers
me when he needs a car.

745
01:31:35,873 --> 01:31:38,307
lt hurts me, Sanju.
But l can still...

746
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:43,172
do anything for you.
Don't ever forget me, Sanju.

747
01:32:04,034 --> 01:32:05,797
Who is accompanying her?

748
01:32:11,842 --> 01:32:13,810
What is she doing
with a boy from Model?

749
01:32:27,892 --> 01:32:29,519
Do you know Devika?

750
01:32:30,995 --> 01:32:33,259
She is from Queens College
and is of our class.

751
01:32:33,564 --> 01:32:38,399
How dare a stupid localite of
Model College, befriend her?

752
01:32:39,536 --> 01:32:43,939
Are you Devika's father?
- Mind your language, bastard!

753
01:32:49,546 --> 01:32:52,014
And l am not a bastard
but you are.

754
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:00,989
Come on, jerk!

755
01:33:40,864 --> 01:33:43,355
What happened? Why are you fighting?

756
01:33:43,867 --> 01:33:45,835
Sir, he is attempting to
ruin a respectable girl.

757
01:33:46,537 --> 01:33:49,199
Which girl?
- Devika. From Queens College.

758
01:33:49,473 --> 01:33:51,338
She is my family friend.
- Cut the crap!

759
01:33:51,575 --> 01:33:53,304
Shut up!
- Get lost!

760
01:33:59,883 --> 01:34:03,785
You are standing upright now.

761
01:34:04,989 --> 01:34:09,449
Lest my boys break your ribs.

762
01:34:10,828 --> 01:34:11,795
Understand?

763
01:34:19,837 --> 01:34:22,806
What happened, Sanju?
- Quiet! You're spoiling him.

764
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,500
He must have started the fight.
- Don't interfere in my matters.

765
01:34:26,977 --> 01:34:28,808
l don't need your sermon.

766
01:34:37,154 --> 01:34:40,123
l'm glad to have found you.
l have something important to discuss.

767
01:34:40,457 --> 01:34:43,824
Let's go sit somewhere.
- Not now. l have to go for rehearsals

768
01:34:44,528 --> 01:34:48,430
Next Sunday is the a dance competition.
We're participating with Rajput College

769
01:34:48,866 --> 01:34:50,493
Shekhar is also participating.

770
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:55,538
Right now, l want to
tell you about myself.

771
01:34:59,877 --> 01:35:01,902
Devika, hurry up.
The bus is leaving.

772
01:35:04,982 --> 01:35:07,450
l'm off now, we'll meet at
the dance competition.

773
01:35:07,918 --> 01:35:10,250
You are in the Xavier's team, right?
- Yes.

774
01:35:17,895 --> 01:35:21,126
ln the lnter School Dance Competition,
after St.Peter's College,

775
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,298
is Xavier's College
at number four.

776
01:35:48,225 --> 01:35:51,922
''We are crazy for love,
we are love lorn''

777
01:35:52,296 --> 01:35:55,459
''Our songs are full of
youth''

778
01:35:56,066 --> 01:35:59,194
''Because of us
is this world''

779
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:32,498
''Where ever you see
in the darkness of the night''

780
01:36:33,003 --> 01:36:36,404
''Or you search in the
morning light''

781
01:36:36,873 --> 01:36:40,434
''We all are seen,
no one can be are equal''

782
01:36:45,315 --> 01:36:48,443
''The world is
because of us''

783
01:36:58,528 --> 01:37:00,792
Let's see how many points
the judges have given them.

784
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:04,192
After the spectacular
performance by Xavier's,...

785
01:37:04,501 --> 01:37:07,265
the next college is Model.

786
01:37:12,876 --> 01:37:14,844
Xavier's performed well,
didn't they?

787
01:37:16,546 --> 01:37:18,411
Now, it is Model's turn.

788
01:38:07,531 --> 01:38:10,932
''You are young, my friends.
Come on, don't feel depressed''

789
01:38:11,501 --> 01:38:14,959
''Look at me!''

790
01:38:15,572 --> 01:38:19,372
''Agreed that l have no money now,
but that won't be forever''

791
01:38:19,843 --> 01:38:21,936
''Even my fate will shine one day''

792
01:38:22,312 --> 01:38:25,804
''Believe me, my friends''

793
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,334
''Manage with whatever you
earn through hard work''

794
01:39:20,837 --> 01:39:24,238
''Don't eye what others have''

795
01:39:24,975 --> 01:39:29,002
''Fate will smile on
us too one day''

796
01:39:29,379 --> 01:39:32,371
''The world will envy us too''

797
01:39:32,916 --> 01:39:36,818
''Agreed that l have no money now,
but that won't be forever''

798
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:41,250
''Even my fate
will shine one day''

799
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:45,824
''Believe me, my friends''

800
01:40:27,571 --> 01:40:29,300
l have won a lottery!

801
01:41:07,043 --> 01:41:10,035
''You are young, my friends.
Come on, don't feel depressed''

802
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:14,241
''Look at me!''

803
01:41:15,185 --> 01:41:19,019
''Agreed that l have no money now,
but that won't be forever''

804
01:41:19,389 --> 01:41:23,450
''Even my fate will shine one day,
my friends''

805
01:41:23,994 --> 01:41:27,862
''Believe me, my friends''

806
01:41:33,503 --> 01:41:36,495
That was Model College.
l can hardly believe...

807
01:41:36,973 --> 01:41:39,498
that Model college could give such
a lovely performance.

808
01:41:43,613 --> 01:41:45,877
Now, it's our turn.

809
01:41:58,928 --> 01:42:02,420
l believe, the judges are taking
some time to give the points.

810
01:42:03,566 --> 01:42:08,833
And now for last year's winning teams,
Queens College and Rajput College.

811
01:42:56,686 --> 01:43:00,918
''My name is Fonseca''
You don't know me, baby''

812
01:43:01,257 --> 01:43:05,819
''You cannot escape me,
you will have to come to me''

813
01:43:06,529 --> 01:43:10,488
''My name is Monica. l won't
be intimidated by your threats''

814
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,835
''l will go where l please''

815
01:43:35,892 --> 01:43:39,953
''l own a car and a bungalow''

816
01:43:40,563 --> 01:43:44,192
''Moreover, l will
even love you''

817
01:43:44,701 --> 01:43:49,001
''All your big talks are a sham''

818
01:43:49,672 --> 01:43:53,574
''Your boots are borrowed,
your suit is hired''

819
01:43:55,345 --> 01:43:59,406
''My name is Fonseca.
You don't know me, baby''

820
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:04,478
''You cannot escape me,
you will have to come to me''

821
01:44:48,898 --> 01:44:52,857
''Sorry O dear,
l did not understand you''

822
01:44:53,469 --> 01:44:57,371
''You are just the
right guy to marry''

823
01:44:57,907 --> 01:45:01,308
''My dreams will all
come true now''

824
01:45:02,645 --> 01:45:06,513
''We give a damn for
those who envy us''

825
01:45:13,022 --> 01:45:17,254
''My name is Fonseca.
You don't know me, baby''

826
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:22,224
''You cannot escape me,
you will have to come to me''

827
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,433
Last year's winning teams,
Rajput and Queens college.

828
01:46:01,838 --> 01:46:05,467
All the colleges have performed
well in today's competition.

829
01:46:07,443 --> 01:46:11,470
The judges decision is before me.
Let's see who are the winners.

830
01:46:35,872 --> 01:46:39,399
Shakur, l'm off to the bank
and l might be delayed.

831
01:46:39,876 --> 01:46:40,843
Yes, sir.

832
01:46:51,587 --> 01:46:53,555
l'm sorry that l couldn't
meet you after the dance.

833
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:56,424
Even if we had met, l would
have said the same thing.

834
01:46:56,893 --> 01:46:59,521
You're absolutely
wonderful, Sanjay.

835
01:47:02,065 --> 01:47:04,795
l didn't know
that you were so great.

836
01:47:05,368 --> 01:47:08,496
You ought to get the first
prize for what you did.

837
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:13,942
l worked very hard, but l must have
lacked something to have missed it.

838
01:47:14,978 --> 01:47:17,811
You didn't understand.
Anyway, forget it.

839
01:47:18,381 --> 01:47:20,372
l'll be there at Mallroad
at approximately 8 O'clock.

840
01:47:20,850 --> 01:47:22,215
All right, at 8.

841
01:47:28,658 --> 01:47:31,218
Where are you coming from?
- The doctor's clinic.

842
01:47:31,527 --> 01:47:32,994
Why?
- l've got fever.

843
01:47:33,196 --> 01:47:36,393
Goodness! You ought to rest.
Why are you loitering around?

844
01:47:36,866 --> 01:47:38,333
l'm on my way home.

845
01:47:40,103 --> 01:47:42,162
Anjali, could l get
a car from your garage?

846
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:46,235
Where do you have to go?

847
01:47:46,609 --> 01:47:50,101
Devika's coming to meet me today
and l'll have to drop her back.

848
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:52,242
You can take it.

849
01:47:55,585 --> 01:47:58,247
Oh Anjali, sometimes l feel
as though l am in a dream.

850
01:47:59,889 --> 01:48:03,256
Frankly, l'd never contemplated
that a rich girl like Devika...

851
01:48:03,559 --> 01:48:06,357
would fall in love with me.
- Sanju, may l say something?

852
01:48:06,829 --> 01:48:09,798
Sure.
- Are you sure she really loves you?

853
01:48:10,533 --> 01:48:13,229
l mean, some girls
are hard to understand.

854
01:48:13,536 --> 01:48:15,504
No, Anjali. lt is not a
case of mistaken feelings.

855
01:48:16,539 --> 01:48:20,031
Have you told her all about yourself?
- That l'm from Model?

856
01:48:20,643 --> 01:48:23,441
She realised that on the day of the
dance competition. And she knows...

857
01:48:23,913 --> 01:48:25,471
no wealthy boy studies at Model.

858
01:48:25,848 --> 01:48:28,248
No wonder she went pale
when she saw you.

859
01:48:28,518 --> 01:48:29,849
What?
- Yes, Sanju.

860
01:48:30,119 --> 01:48:32,087
The moment she realised you were
from Model and not Xavier's...

861
01:48:32,288 --> 01:48:35,314
What nonsense! lf that was
the case, why would she call me?

862
01:48:35,591 --> 01:48:38,321
Why would she praise my dance
and come to meet me today?

863
01:48:38,661 --> 01:48:42,062
All girls are not the same.
Devika is not a gold digger.

864
01:48:42,565 --> 01:48:45,227
She likes me.
She loves Sanju.

865
01:48:45,601 --> 01:48:47,831
Don't be naive, Sanju.
She doesn't love you.

866
01:48:48,137 --> 01:48:52,471
You are raving. lnstead of being happy
for me, you're trying to create doubts

867
01:48:52,975 --> 01:48:57,002
No Sanju, l'm trying to stop you
from making a mistake.

868
01:48:57,547 --> 01:49:01,381
l don't want you
to be deeply hurt.

869
01:49:02,218 --> 01:49:04,982
Anjali, l don't like
this pointless talk from you.

870
01:49:05,521 --> 01:49:09,184
lf you don't approve the truth,
l'll never speak to you again.

871
01:49:09,525 --> 01:49:11,322
l won't meet you either.

872
01:49:14,564 --> 01:49:16,532
l don't want to see you either.

873
01:49:18,534 --> 01:49:21,469
Sanju, you shouldn't speak to
Anjali in this manner.

874
01:49:21,971 --> 01:49:23,939
Why? What was wrong
with my statement?

875
01:49:24,507 --> 01:49:26,873
Let it be.
... Bye, Sanju.

876
01:49:28,511 --> 01:49:30,342
Everyone seems to have gone crazy.

877
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:41,147
Shakur, l'm going out and
l'll be back in a short while.

878
01:49:41,557 --> 01:49:45,049
Hey! Who will serve at the tables?
Don't go anywhere.

879
01:49:59,375 --> 01:50:01,240
Hey, waiter!

880
01:50:16,893 --> 01:50:19,521
What will you have, Devika?
- What do you get here?

881
01:50:19,996 --> 01:50:23,454
Nothing special,
it's a lousy cafe.

882
01:50:24,901 --> 01:50:27,369
Now that we're here,
let's have some coffee...

883
01:50:27,904 --> 01:50:29,997
or the poor chap
will lose his tip.

884
01:50:31,908 --> 01:50:33,569
Fetch us 2 cups of coffee.

885
01:50:34,076 --> 01:50:36,874
And make sure that the
cups are washed and clean.

886
01:50:42,919 --> 01:50:44,887
Chotu, give me 2 cups of coffee.

887
01:50:45,988 --> 01:50:48,889
See? He doesn't seem to be ashamed.

888
01:50:49,592 --> 01:50:51,890
He is a perfect example
of a jerk from Model School.

889
01:51:03,573 --> 01:51:07,373
ls this Thapar's son?
- That's what he told me.

890
01:51:09,879 --> 01:51:12,848
Why would Thapar's
son be at this joint?

891
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:18,452
Perhaps his father threw him out,
so he has to work at this lousy cafe.

892
01:51:22,892 --> 01:51:25,452
Hey! There's no need
to stand around.

893
01:51:25,895 --> 01:51:27,863
Fetch the bill when
we have finished our coffee.

894
01:51:28,097 --> 01:51:30,895
You'll get paid for the coffee
as well as receive a tip. Get lost!

895
01:51:39,942 --> 01:51:41,102
Thapar's son !

896
01:52:28,691 --> 01:52:31,091
You said, money didn't matter to you.

897
01:52:31,894 --> 01:52:35,421
You said that it wouldn't matter if
l didn't have anything in the future.

898
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,295
So it was a lie.

899
01:52:41,137 --> 01:52:46,200
Someone who starts out with a lie, has
no right to call anyone else a liar.

900
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:52,074
l admit that l lied. But l did it
only to disguise my poverty.

901
01:52:52,548 --> 01:52:54,482
And you lied to disguise
your deceit.

902
01:52:54,917 --> 01:52:57,442
Until yesterday l was Thapar's son,
so you approved of me.

903
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,014
And now that l am an ordinary
man's son, l disgust you.

904
01:53:01,891 --> 01:53:05,224
That's because you want a rich
boyfriend. lf not Thapar's son...

905
01:53:05,528 --> 01:53:09,089
Malhotra's son Shekhar will do,
regardless of his bad character. Right?

906
01:53:09,565 --> 01:53:11,294
Yes, that's it.

907
01:53:35,024 --> 01:53:37,857
What is the matter, Devika?
- Nothing.

908
01:53:41,030 --> 01:53:44,466
Hey Jerk, l've left you
Rs 10 at your cafe.

909
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:46,868
Take it from
your champion brother.

910
01:53:55,911 --> 01:54:00,143
Why are you hiding your face now?
She wouldn't even care to spit on it.

911
01:54:00,549 --> 01:54:04,349
Stay within your limits, you'll
be happy. Go and take the tenner.

912
01:54:23,472 --> 01:54:25,497
Beat him!
Don't spare him!

913
01:54:31,247 --> 01:54:32,271
Pick him up.

914
01:54:36,585 --> 01:54:38,314
You woo a girl, eh?

915
01:54:38,687 --> 01:54:40,314
You're Model's hero, eh?

916
01:54:45,561 --> 01:54:48,530
Bloody localite! How dare you woo
a girl from Queens?

917
01:54:51,133 --> 01:54:53,431
You've become too big for
your boots. Didn't l tell you...

918
01:54:53,903 --> 01:54:56,565
l did not want any tricks from you?

919
01:54:59,708 --> 01:55:00,606
Bastard!

920
01:55:05,514 --> 01:55:08,950
Don't spare him!
Break his bones!

921
01:55:10,019 --> 01:55:13,978
Will you approach a girl again?
Do you take us for fools?

922
01:56:15,117 --> 01:56:17,517
Careful... watch it!

923
01:56:39,441 --> 01:56:40,430
Get lost!

924
01:56:43,879 --> 01:56:45,369
Both of you go home.

925
01:56:46,882 --> 01:56:48,042
Come along!

926
01:56:49,919 --> 01:56:52,251
l've warned you not to war
with these boys.

927
01:56:53,422 --> 01:56:55,413
You're still on Devika's case.

928
01:56:56,659 --> 01:56:59,287
Mark my words, this fight
will blow out of proportion.

929
01:56:59,962 --> 01:57:03,090
And, if l hadn't arrived, they
would have broken all your bones.

930
01:57:03,432 --> 01:57:05,866
Hey! l could have handled
them alone.

931
01:57:06,201 --> 01:57:08,795
Who asked you to interfere?
Don't pretend to be a great saviour.

932
01:57:09,138 --> 01:57:12,369
l see! So you're very strong, eh?
... Come on.

933
01:57:12,841 --> 01:57:14,809
Ratan, l warn you.
Don't mess with me.

934
01:57:15,077 --> 01:57:17,272
Are you afraid?
- Hey!

935
01:57:40,536 --> 01:57:43,369
l gave you Rs 5000 to deposit at
the bank but this shows only Rs 1000.

936
01:57:43,606 --> 01:57:45,574
Father, you didn't
give me any money.

937
01:57:46,575 --> 01:57:49,305
Oh yes, l had given it
to Sanju. Sanju...

938
01:57:52,615 --> 01:57:54,082
l had...

939
01:57:56,051 --> 01:57:59,282
What's this?
You've fought again !

940
01:58:02,858 --> 01:58:07,454
l gave you 5000 to deposit at the
bank. But this shows only Rs 1000.

941
01:58:10,099 --> 01:58:13,796
How much did you deposit?
Why don't you answer?

942
01:58:15,871 --> 01:58:16,838
Rs 1000.

943
01:58:17,373 --> 01:58:19,500
1000? What about
the remaining Rs 4000?

944
01:58:21,977 --> 01:58:23,376
l spent it.

945
01:58:23,946 --> 01:58:28,815
Spent it! What did you spend on?
Why don't you tell me?

946
01:58:30,486 --> 01:58:34,047
lt wasn't a paltry sum that
you spent with no explanations!

947
01:58:35,457 --> 01:58:37,220
Did you gamble?

948
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:40,488
Where is the Rs 4000?
Tell me!

949
01:58:41,864 --> 01:58:45,322
l can't tell you,
but l will return the money.

950
01:58:47,536 --> 01:58:52,235
l'm working day and night in order
to buy a cycle for Ratan.

951
01:58:52,608 --> 01:58:56,009
And you blow it up without
a second thought. Get out!

952
01:58:57,046 --> 01:59:01,983
Get out!
And don't you dare to return !

953
02:00:07,149 --> 02:00:11,245
Father, there's no need to go
to Delhi to buy a new cycle.

954
02:00:11,553 --> 02:00:14,579
lt will be an unnecessary expense.
Besides, my old cycle will suffice.

955
02:00:15,124 --> 02:00:20,221
Don't worry about it.
l'll be back by 11 p.m.

956
02:00:20,596 --> 02:00:21,858
All right, father.

957
02:00:23,899 --> 02:00:27,164
Father, please forgive Sanju.

958
02:00:28,070 --> 02:00:31,062
l'll reason with him.
lt won't happen again.

959
02:00:31,607 --> 02:00:33,370
Allow him to come home.

960
02:00:37,613 --> 02:00:38,580
Let's go.

961
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:07,839
Sanju, father has gone to Delhi
and he will return at 11 p.m.

962
02:01:09,545 --> 02:01:13,072
l apologised on your behalf and
he has forgiven you. Come home now.

963
02:01:15,884 --> 02:01:20,253
l know you're angry with me.
l shouldn't have hit you.

964
02:01:20,923 --> 02:01:24,051
Next time, l will ignore the fact
that you are my older brother.

965
02:01:25,294 --> 02:01:27,854
And l don't need your pity.
Here's your blanket.

966
02:01:28,897 --> 02:01:31,866
lt wasn't me, but Anjali, who
covered you with this blanket.

967
02:01:34,603 --> 02:01:36,195
Anyway, l'm sorry.

968
02:02:22,551 --> 02:02:27,420
Yesterday, your fighter and you
were lucky because l wasn't present.

969
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:30,251
What will you do today?

970
02:02:30,492 --> 02:02:32,858
l'll give you the same treatment
that l gave your friends.

971
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:41,467
You will have to be
taught a lesson.

972
02:02:46,909 --> 02:02:48,877
Let's see who
teaches whom a lesson?

973
02:04:24,539 --> 02:04:28,999
Ratan's met with an accident.
- What! How did it happen?

974
02:04:29,578 --> 02:04:33,139
l don't know, but it seems that he
fell off the cliff with his cycle.

975
02:04:33,482 --> 02:04:35,507
He has been taken to the
Government hospital... hurry!

976
02:04:49,398 --> 02:04:51,866
Doctor, l am
Ratan's younger brother.

977
02:04:52,401 --> 02:04:55,427
How is he? What has happened to him?
- Where is your father?

978
02:04:55,704 --> 02:04:57,262
He has gone to Delhi.
- When will he return?

979
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:59,531
Tonight.
- Bring him over as soon as he returns

980
02:04:59,941 --> 02:05:03,377
But, doctor, what's happened to him?
- The operation is badly needed.

981
02:05:03,845 --> 02:05:05,403
l don't have the time to spare.

982
02:05:26,268 --> 02:05:28,828
No one can defeat Ratan now.

983
02:05:33,642 --> 02:05:34,836
Call Ratan.

984
02:05:43,585 --> 02:05:45,382
Father...
- What is the matter?

985
02:05:48,690 --> 02:05:53,354
l have forgiven you. But don't repeat
this mistake again.

986
02:05:53,895 --> 02:05:56,557
Go... go and fetch Ratan.

987
02:05:57,899 --> 02:06:01,198
Ratan has met with an accident.
... He is in the hospital.

988
02:06:23,859 --> 02:06:27,226
The state in which he was brought,
required an emergency operation.

989
02:06:29,531 --> 02:06:31,431
He's still in coma.

990
02:06:37,672 --> 02:06:42,837
l do not wish to raise false hopes.
His condition is very critical.

991
02:08:08,630 --> 02:08:10,029
Be brave.

992
02:08:12,834 --> 02:08:13,801
Yes.

993
02:08:17,105 --> 02:08:19,073
Last night,
l fought with Ratan.

994
02:08:19,975 --> 02:08:25,345
This morning he came to pacify me,
but l didn't respond.

995
02:08:27,148 --> 02:08:28,809
lf anything happens to him...

996
02:08:34,923 --> 02:08:36,515
What will happen now?

997
02:08:37,993 --> 02:08:43,226
How will father survive?
Ratan means everything to father.

998
02:08:44,566 --> 02:08:46,534
He... and you too.

999
02:09:52,867 --> 02:09:55,836
''lf ever you got annoyed
with me...''

1000
02:09:56,571 --> 02:09:59,506
''and went away ..''

1001
02:10:00,508 --> 02:10:06,845
''l had never expected
to miss you so much''

1002
02:10:50,625 --> 02:10:55,392
''l could never walk
even two steps...''

1003
02:10:55,930 --> 02:10:57,227
''without you''

1004
02:10:58,466 --> 02:11:03,836
''Yet in my innocence,
l always thought ...

1005
02:11:06,508 --> 02:11:11,844
''you will never leave me''

1006
02:11:21,523 --> 02:11:27,428
''l had never expected to miss
you so much''

1007
02:11:29,130 --> 02:11:31,860
''lf ever you got annoyed
with me...''

1008
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:35,865
''and went away...''

1009
02:13:05,093 --> 02:13:07,527
Ratan has regained
consciousness.

1010
02:13:07,996 --> 02:13:11,523
l'm returning from the hospital.
He's fine. He even spoke to me.

1011
02:13:12,033 --> 02:13:15,469
The Lord has answered our prayers!

1012
02:13:48,703 --> 02:13:50,364
What if he tells the police?

1013
02:13:51,072 --> 02:13:54,041
l warned you to tell the principal,
but you...

1014
02:13:56,044 --> 02:13:58,035
lt would have been better
if he had died.

1015
02:14:03,851 --> 02:14:04,818
Water...

1016
02:14:07,121 --> 02:14:08,816
water...
- l'll get it.

1017
02:14:28,876 --> 02:14:32,243
lf you tell anything to anyone,
the consequences won't be good.

1018
02:14:33,581 --> 02:14:34,548
Get that?

1019
02:14:48,896 --> 02:14:51,057
What was he doing here, so late?

1020
02:14:52,567 --> 02:14:53,534
Tell me.

1021
02:14:55,570 --> 02:14:59,097
You are keeping something from me.
What is the matter?

1022
02:15:01,442 --> 02:15:03,376
Tell me.
- l'll tell you.

1023
02:15:07,382 --> 02:15:10,408
Sanju, do you think that
l'll be alright for the race?

1024
02:15:13,254 --> 02:15:14,812
Drink your medicine.

1025
02:15:17,992 --> 02:15:19,983
The race is on the 24th
of next month.

1026
02:15:21,462 --> 02:15:25,159
Even if l get a week's practice,
it will suffice.

1027
02:15:26,267 --> 02:15:27,529
What say?

1028
02:15:29,671 --> 02:15:32,071
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

1029
02:15:33,941 --> 02:15:37,399
There's still a month and a half left.
- Yes,

1030
02:15:37,879 --> 02:15:41,440
a month and a half left.
This time, l will defeat him.

1031
02:15:43,685 --> 02:15:46,950
Sanju, l will surely
defeat him this time.

1032
02:15:48,589 --> 02:15:50,352
l won't spare him.

1033
02:15:54,562 --> 02:15:56,189
l'll defeat him.

1034
02:16:04,505 --> 02:16:07,133
Come along, Sanju. Hurry up,
Ghode, let's go.

1035
02:16:18,419 --> 02:16:19,818
Shall we go?

1036
02:16:22,924 --> 02:16:25,415
Anjali, l will participate
in the cycle race this year.

1037
02:16:25,893 --> 02:16:29,226
What! Are you serious?
- Yes.

1038
02:16:30,565 --> 02:16:32,829
l might not be able
to take Ratan's place...

1039
02:16:33,868 --> 02:16:36,530
but it's the least
l can do for father.

1040
02:16:37,171 --> 02:16:41,505
Do your best, Sanju.
l'm with you all the way.

1041
02:17:33,961 --> 02:17:37,397
ldiot, you are taking advantage
of her feelings for you !

1042
02:18:24,345 --> 02:18:26,006
What is the matter?

1043
02:18:31,385 --> 02:18:33,353
Anjali, you might
consider it strange,...

1044
02:18:33,888 --> 02:18:36,322
but l'd like to tell you
what l have been feeling ...

1045
02:18:36,991 --> 02:18:39,516
these last few days.
- What?

1046
02:18:41,028 --> 02:18:43,360
l have always considered
you as my closest friend.

1047
02:18:47,535 --> 02:18:49,833
But... l have grown
to love you now.

1048
02:19:28,509 --> 02:19:30,477
You'll be perfectly alright
in another 3 or 4 weeks.

1049
02:19:30,845 --> 02:19:34,406
Until then, take care that you don't
put too much weight on this leg.

1050
02:19:42,857 --> 02:19:46,816
Don't be dejected.
lt is destiny.

1051
02:19:48,562 --> 02:19:50,996
lt doesn't matter that you can't
take part in the race tomorrow.

1052
02:19:52,066 --> 02:19:56,366
Without you, Shekhar's victory
will be meaningless anyway.

1053
02:20:10,584 --> 02:20:13,485
lt is Ratan's cycle. Only a
little work remains to be done.

1054
02:20:13,921 --> 02:20:15,513
Tomorrow is the race ...

1055
02:20:15,890 --> 02:20:18,051
and Sanju wants to
use this cycle for the race.

1056
02:20:24,899 --> 02:20:26,867
What is the matter, Kalpana?

1057
02:20:27,902 --> 02:20:30,871
Aren't you aware of Ratan's grief?

1058
02:20:33,607 --> 02:20:36,872
He had worked very hard
to participate in this race.

1059
02:20:38,346 --> 02:20:41,543
And now...
he is not in this race.

1060
02:20:43,918 --> 02:20:46,443
And Sanju is responsible
for all of it.

1061
02:20:46,921 --> 02:20:48,445
Sanju?
- Yes.

1062
02:20:49,023 --> 02:20:51,355
lf he hadn't messed around
with Shekhar...

1063
02:20:51,625 --> 02:20:55,493
Shekhar and his friends wouldn't...
- What did they do?

1064
02:20:58,065 --> 02:21:01,228
Anjali, please don't
disclose this to anyone.

1065
02:21:02,003 --> 02:21:06,372
Ratan forbade me to do so.
Please, Anjali, for my sake.

1066
02:21:49,950 --> 02:21:51,975
Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

1067
02:21:52,286 --> 02:21:54,254
You know perfectly well.

1068
02:21:54,922 --> 02:21:59,256
Shekhar and his friends attempted
to kill you and you kept mum?!

1069
02:22:02,596 --> 02:22:05,929
Ratan, you aren't aware of what
father and l have been through.

1070
02:22:07,535 --> 02:22:09,230
We nearly lost you.

1071
02:22:15,876 --> 02:22:17,343
lt's my fault.

1072
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:21,548
You became the target for
Shekhar's enmity towards me.

1073
02:22:29,957 --> 02:22:31,185
Where are you going?
- Let me go!

1074
02:22:31,392 --> 02:22:32,552
Let go of the rod!
- Let me go!

1075
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:34,027
Leave it!

1076
02:22:40,601 --> 02:22:44,264
Do you want to know why l kept mum?
Listen carefully.

1077
02:22:45,573 --> 02:22:48,508
When l came to my senses,
l noticed that you had changed.

1078
02:22:49,977 --> 02:22:54,311
You had changed completely. You had
begun to realise your responsibilities

1079
02:22:56,083 --> 02:22:59,109
You learned to appreciate me.
.... and father.

1080
02:23:01,522 --> 02:23:04,423
You became closer to us.
l was very happy.

1081
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:14,425
For your happiness, l couldn't care
if anything happened to me.

1082
02:23:31,018 --> 02:23:35,853
l troubled you so much.
Yet you never said anything to me.

1083
02:23:37,491 --> 02:23:42,861
l know you love me, Sanju.
That's why you want to take revenge.

1084
02:23:45,432 --> 02:23:47,332
You want to do something for me?

1085
02:23:49,603 --> 02:23:50,467
Yes.

1086
02:23:50,905 --> 02:23:54,272
Then forget all this. l have prepared
the new cycle for you.

1087
02:23:54,575 --> 02:23:57,339
Take it and try your best
at the race tomorrow.

1088
02:24:00,481 --> 02:24:03,450
Who are the brave kids?
- Rajput! Rajput!

1089
02:24:03,918 --> 02:24:07,376
Who are the leaders?
- Rajput! Rajput!

1090
02:24:08,589 --> 02:24:10,216
Senior boys 200m race.

1091
02:24:11,525 --> 02:24:14,426
Shekhar of Rajput leads from the start,
Randhir from Xavier's is behind him...

1092
02:24:14,862 --> 02:24:18,229
very closely. Shekhar speeds up,
and...

1093
02:24:18,666 --> 02:24:21,226
and he wins.
Shekhar Malhotra has won.

1094
02:24:22,636 --> 02:24:26,128
Champion for two consecutive years,
responsible for bringing Rajput...

1095
02:24:26,407 --> 02:24:28,841
to the first position,
Shekhar Malhotra

1096
02:24:35,883 --> 02:24:38,443
Rajput have risen to
first place with 230.

1097
02:24:38,886 --> 02:24:42,845
Model behind them, 225.
Xavier's are placed third on 215.

1098
02:24:46,427 --> 02:24:49,260
And again, the cycle race will be
the deciding factor...

1099
02:24:49,597 --> 02:24:51,565
for the inter school
championship trophy.

1100
02:24:52,566 --> 02:24:56,297
lt's a very important race
for Shekhar Malhotra. lf he wins...

1101
02:24:56,604 --> 02:25:00,199
this time too, it'll be three
consecutive wins for him...

1102
02:25:00,474 --> 02:25:03,807
and it will be a new record
for the inter school championship.

1103
02:25:22,463 --> 02:25:25,159
The brave sportsmen have
set off for their destination.

1104
02:25:25,866 --> 02:25:29,563
A 50 km cycle race. From the
stadium to Pykara junction.

1105
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:32,538
then a 20 km passage
through Baramulla Hills...

1106
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:35,440
to the highest point.

1107
02:25:42,583 --> 02:25:44,278
''We are as good as anyone - Model''

1108
02:25:55,696 --> 02:25:58,164
The cyclists are passing through.
lt remains to be seen ...

1109
02:25:58,432 --> 02:26:00,366
who crosses the dangerous
terrain of Baramulla.

1110
02:26:12,012 --> 02:26:14,810
''Baramulla Hills''

1111
02:27:12,239 --> 02:27:14,969
l'm Rakesh Sharma reporting
from check post 2 at Pillar Rock.

1112
02:27:17,544 --> 02:27:20,138
The first cyclists have
reached Pillar Rock.

1113
02:27:20,414 --> 02:27:22,382
ln the lead is Shekhar
Malhotra from Rajput College.

1114
02:27:32,025 --> 02:27:34,391
ln fifth place is Sanjaylal
Sharma from Model College.

1115
02:28:13,367 --> 02:28:14,994
Be careful, or you might fall!

1116
02:28:17,838 --> 02:28:20,807
Come along.
- The jerk is losing air.

1117
02:29:10,457 --> 02:29:14,484
Bastard! l was bound by
my promise to Ratan, ...

1118
02:29:15,062 --> 02:29:16,791
but l won't spare you now.

1119
02:29:21,969 --> 02:29:24,267
Because of you, my brother is not
participating in today's race.

1120
02:29:30,511 --> 02:29:32,809
l'll see how you are
able to finish this race.

1121
02:29:33,146 --> 02:29:36,411
Get lost, jerk! l'll
see how you try to stop me.

1122
02:29:56,236 --> 02:29:57,999
You hit my brother.

1123
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:01,167
This is Ratan's reply.

1124
02:30:17,591 --> 02:30:20,424
You won't let me
finish the race, eh?

1125
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:28,261
They've gone ahead!

1126
02:30:28,902 --> 02:30:31,268
Shekhar, go ahead.
We'll take care of him.

1127
02:30:31,572 --> 02:30:33,335
Don't set him free.

1128
02:30:33,907 --> 02:30:34,874
Well...

1129
02:31:34,568 --> 02:31:36,536
The cyclists are returning to
Pykara junction. ln the lead is...

1130
02:31:36,937 --> 02:31:40,373

02:32:01,528 --> 02:32:03,962
And at eleventh place is

1136
02:32:28,889 --> 02:32:30,481
Xavier's is in the lead.

1137
02:32:32,059 --> 02:32:33,526
Lawrence is second.

1138
02:32:34,594 --> 02:32:36,289
Andrews is third.

1139
02:32:46,139 --> 02:32:48,039
Shekhar Malhotra has arrived.

1140
02:32:58,585 --> 02:33:00,485
And now, it is
Sanjaylal Sharma from Model

1141
02:33:22,042 --> 02:33:25,011
Sanjaylal Sharma has
started his first lap.

1142
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:29,310
Overtaking a Xavier's cyclist,
he occupies 10th position...

1143
02:33:29,649 --> 02:33:33,176
Moving at great speed, Shekhar
has come to the 5th position.

1144
02:33:34,888 --> 02:33:37,049
Shekhar Malhotra has
started his second lap.

1145
02:33:38,291 --> 02:33:41,488
Sanjaylal is now at 7th place.

1146
02:33:50,904 --> 02:33:53,964
Cyclists number 7 and 8
have taken a bad fall.

1147
02:34:03,550 --> 02:34:05,518
Shekhar Malhotra is at
the first position.

1148
02:34:09,556 --> 02:34:12,150
Sanjaylal Sharma is at
the second position.

1149
02:34:31,411 --> 02:34:32,844
He's close to Shekhar...

1150
02:34:33,880 --> 02:34:34,847
even closer.

1151
02:34:38,685 --> 02:34:40,653
And that's the end
of the third lap.

1152
02:34:57,938 --> 02:34:59,462
A little bit more!

1153
02:35:06,580 --> 02:35:08,411
This is the fifth
and last lap!

1154
02:35:24,497 --> 02:35:26,522
The Championship is
only 200m away.

1155
02:37:23,016 --> 02:37:25,814
Mr Ramlal, even
l accept it today.

1156
02:37:26,653 --> 02:37:29,019
''He who wins is the conqueror!''
