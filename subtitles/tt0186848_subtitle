1
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:23,736
The great king. .

2
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:28,141
. .the victorious Panduraja. .

3
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,721
. . is entering the courtyard. .

4
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,183
. .after defeating the enemies.

5
00:02:41,832 --> 00:02:45,063
Salutations, brother.
- May God bless you !

6
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:48,465
I am happy to receive you after
your victory in the battlefield. .

7
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:51,873
. . but I can't
accept your salutations.

8
00:02:52,076 --> 00:02:53,475
What's my offence?
- When the head of the dynasty. .

9
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:55,479
. . Bheeshma is here,
how can you salute me. .

10
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:59,038
. . before saluting him?
- He hasn't done anything wrong.

11
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:01,075
Do not doubt Panduraju's propriety.

12
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,683
Dhrutarastra, you are
the king of this kingdom.

13
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:06,752
And we are all your servants.

14
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:09,151
You deserve the first salutations.

15
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:12,421
Though I am the king, you
are the head of this kingdom. .

16
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:14,157
. .and brother uses his talent.

17
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:17,433
I am just a fortunate
person to be in your company.

18
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,463
Brother, you are
undermining your strength.

19
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,962
Your physical strength is matchless.

20
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:25,135
Your intelligence is as
high as the mountains.

21
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:28,444
If you had eyes the rival
kings wouldn't have dared. .

22
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:32,710
. .to come in front of you.
God did injustice to you.

23
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,816
You are right. Your
words are true, brother.

24
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:44,594
Brother Vidhura, how are you?

25
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:46,461
I hope your worshipping and
ceremonies for the deity. .

26
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,998
. .are going on
without any obstacles.

27
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,463
Gods are pleased with
Vidhura's devotion. .

28
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:54,663
. .and a blessing for the world.
- Blessing?

29
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:59,975
Who knows how happy Gods
are with Vidhura's devotion !

30
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:05,947
Brother-in-law Shakuni is
right here? I didn't see you

31
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,814
This person is not that important.

32
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:12,420
The brother-in-law of the
king gets more respect. .

33
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,581
. .than the king.

34
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:18,417
Enough. This is the courtyard.
You can't laugh here.

35
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:24,432
Panduraja, your wives' are
eagerly waiting for you. .

36
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:26,025
. . in the palace.

37
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:40,947
Welcome to the palace.

38
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,521
Accept my salutations.

39
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,190
We welcome the victorious king.

40
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,061
Wives' reception is vital for me.

41
00:04:57,801 --> 00:05:01,396
But it's our tradition
to gift the wives'. .

42
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:06,967
. .who wait for the kings in
the palace. Here they are.

43
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:11,412
I am presenting these ornaments. .

44
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:14,417
. .to the queens of this kingdom.

45
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:19,115
Kunti, you accept that box.

46
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:22,419
It's not me.
There's another person. .

47
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:25,826
. .who should get the first gift.
Am I right, sister? - Yes.

48
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,558
Queen Gandhari is reverend for us.

49
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:34,161
You must present the
first gift to her. - Alright.

50
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:37,440
You must present the
first gift to her. - Alright.

51
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:38,839
. . is quite important in a family.

52
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:41,441
Present these ornaments
along with my salutations. .

53
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:42,809
. .to sister-in-law.

54
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:47,439
I can't see anything. Why are
you giving this blind woman. .

55
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:52,114
. .those ornaments?
- It's for our happiness, sister.

56
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:57,450
Flower emits fragrance not
for itself, but for others.

57
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:03,126
A flower and you both
provide us with happiness.

58
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,401
Sister, shall we adorn the
elder sister with these ornaments. .

59
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,407
. .and serve her?
- You shouldn't serve me, sisters. .

60
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:14,411
. . but you should serve
your husband who returned. .

61
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:16,571
. .after a long battle.

62
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:19,405
Brother-in-law might be
eagerly waiting for you. .

63
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:22,975
. .as he has been away
from you for a long time.

64
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:25,746
Am I right?

65
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:31,460
You must go to him immediately.

66
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,093
Sister, your wish is our command.

67
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,892
We shall go now.

68
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:47,840
Satyasena. Satyasena.
- Yes, sister-in-law.

69
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,970
Have you seen her! Have
you seen Kunti's magnanimity!

70
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:53,806
It's our good fortune to
have her in this family.

71
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,985
No! It's our misfortune.

72
00:06:57,588 --> 00:07:02,116
From distance even the
mountains appear smooth.

73
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:07,795
But sister, the filth in the
heart is not visible to eyes.

74
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:12,061
Brother, why do you have
so much ill-will for others!

75
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,397
Those who cannot see others happy. .

76
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:15,803
. .are digging their own graves.

77
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,405
I know that. But still I
have been telling you since. .

78
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:20,410
. .a long time that you
shouldn't show your generosity. .

79
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:22,001
. .where it is not needed.

80
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:27,774
Sister, danger is
approaching your husband and you.

81
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:32,548
Panduraju is
conspiring against your husband.

82
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,424
Bheeshma has made
the younger brother. .

83
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:42,932
. .the king of this kingdom even
when the elder brother is alive.

84
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:45,900
Brother, stop throwing
muck on their righteousness.

85
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:48,435
Great. You have tied
blindfold on your eyes. .

86
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:50,565
. .as your husband is blind.

87
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,641
Now you want to shut
your ears as well, sister?

88
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:57,012
Hear and see everything.

89
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:59,981
Then you will understand
the real nature of Bheeshma.

90
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,072
Enough !

91
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:04,581
How can you make such
baseless accusations on him!

92
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:06,455
He's a man of integrity.

93
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:08,619
And Panduraju is a
great human being.

94
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:14,429
And Kunti reveres me. Himadri
is an epitome of a human being.

95
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:16,966
Those who point fingers at them. .

96
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,557
. .will be given death-penalty?

97
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:24,396
It's only for your welfare
that I left my kingdom. .

98
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:27,433
. .and came here with my wife.

99
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,138
All I think about is your welfare.

100
00:08:30,547 --> 00:08:32,674
All I want is your happiness.

101
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:36,779
I can do anything for that.

102
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,080
I won't stop even if you stop me.

103
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,590
Aghori, what is your
canon ball saying?

104
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:54,463
Abracadabra.

105
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,575
See this.

106
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:09,917
He is entering the
forest to fight the monster.

107
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:16,184
If he enters the forest
there's a threat to his life.

108
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:33,475
Panduraja, for your
crime of being my enemy. .

109
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,637
. .you will be destroyed by me.

110
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,207
Do you have to ring the
bell to present gifts?

111
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:51,617
What's the problem
that you are facing !

112
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,891
Ours lives are in danger, lord.

113
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:56,531
There's a major threat to our lives.

114
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,233
We are unable to live
peacefully in the forest, lord.

115
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,433
The wild animals are
entering our provinces. .

116
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:08,638
. .and preying on our children.

117
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:11,571
Please hunt that beast
and save our lives, lord.

118
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,442
Brother, if you permit me I will
go to the forest today itself. .

119
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,786
. .and rescue these people.
- You need not go, brother.

120
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:23,982
Yes, you returned from
the battlefield yesterday.

121
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:25,924
You need not leave again today.

122
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:29,929
Don't leave your
queens for a few days.

123
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:33,463
Forgive me, lord. We
shouldn't get the scar. .

124
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:37,473
. .on the reputation of this
kingdom that when the lives. .

125
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:39,475
. .of your people are in
trouble the royal family. .

126
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,137
. . is enjoying the
company of their queens.

127
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:45,479
I think Panduraju
should go to the forest. .

128
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:47,039
. .and rescue these people.

129
00:10:47,184 --> 00:10:49,209
Now it's up to you
to take the decision.

130
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,553
What brother-in-law
Shakuni said is right.

131
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:59,086
I don't want to hamper the
reputation of this kingdom.

132
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,618
Give me your
permission to go to the forest.

133
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:04,432
We cannot do anything that
hampers the reputation. .

134
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:07,561
. .of this kingdom. You
may go to the forest.

135
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:10,633
You may go. You may go.
- Bless me, lord.

136
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:10,898
''You naughty beloved,
you mischievous beloved. ''

137
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:14,570
''Stop your mischief. ''

138
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:18,468
''I will reveal all your secrets. I
will tell everything about you. ''

139
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:22,007
''I will reveal all your secrets. I
will tell everything about you. ''

140
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:29,018
''You naughty beloved,
you mischievous beloved. ''

141
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:32,610
''Stop your mischief. ''

142

''I will reveal all your secrets. I
will tell everything about you. ''

143
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:40,456
''I will reveal all your secrets. I
will tell everything about you. ''

144
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:58,005
''You married me in
presence of fire-god. ''

145
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:01,708
''Now you brought the
other woman home. ''

146
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:09,153
''Even Gods have two wives. ''

147
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,792
''Even Gods have two wives. ''

148
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:16,957
''What's wrong if your
husband has two wives, O sister?''

149
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:23,033
''O my beloved one. O my dear one. ''

150
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,637
''Why are you
screaming at me, O girl?''

151
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:30,506
''Maharaja can hear you.
He can punish me. ''

152
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:34,447
''Maharaja can hear you.
He can punish me. ''

153
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:53,693
''You cast an evil eye on him. ''

154
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,601
''Your trapped this kid. ''

155
00:13:57,874 --> 00:14:01,139
''Your trapped this kid. ''

156
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:05,106
''I didn't call him to me. ''

157
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:08,774
''You are a shameless girl. ''

158
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:11,045
''Get out of our lives. ''

159
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,118
''O my beloved one. O my dear one. ''

160
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,691
''Why are you
screaming at me, O girl?''

161
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:24,730
''Maharaja can hear you.
He can punish me. ''

162
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:28,463
''Maharaja can hear you.
He can punish me. ''

163
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:48,982
''Follow me if you love me. ''

164
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,561
''If you love me, come to me. ''

165
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:55,990
''Come to me.
- Come to me. ''

166
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:59,966
''Come to me.
- Come to me. ''

167
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:05,397
''Why can't you live like
queen Kunti and queen Himadri?''

168
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:08,943
''Why can't you live like
queen Kunti and queen Himadri?''

169
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:13,505
''Learn something from them.
Live in peace like them. ''

170
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:19,152
''O my beloved one. O my dear one. ''

171
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:22,721
''Why do you fight all the times?''

172
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:26,418
''Let's sing and dance and
salute the king and queens. ''

173
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:29,995
''Let's sing and dance and
salute the king and queens. ''

174
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:33,569
''Let's sing and dance and
salute the king and queens. ''

175
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,739
''Let's sing and dance and
salute the king and queens. ''

176
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,775
''Let's sing and dance and
salute the king and queens. ''

177
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:44,504
Performer.

178
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,179
Hey, come here.

179
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,018
Take it.

180
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:03,891
You gave me your
chain for my performance?

181
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,694
May God give you 100 years!

182
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:10,395
Great. Doing charity
comes naturally to everyone. .

183
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,034
. . in this kingdom. Who is that kid?

184
00:16:13,743 --> 00:16:15,074
He's our son, lord.

185
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:26,150
Son, may you prosper in life.

186
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:29,483
Take this.

187
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:35,160
Great. So you only donate, but don'
t accept anything. - Yes.

188
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:39,799
Athiratha, what's
the name of this child?

189
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:42,972
We named him Vashusaina.
But everyone calls him Karna.

190
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:46,736
Why so? - May be because
he was born with the armor.

191
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:48,105
How do you know that, queen?

192
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:52,448
It's clearly visible, lord.
He got this armor with birth. .

193
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,642
. . but it's not an artificial one.

194
00:16:56,119 --> 00:17:01,386
The motherhood inside me
is making me hug this child.

195
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:03,992
Come to me, son.

196
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,060
Won't you come to me?

197
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,588
Go to her, son.

198
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,964
I am like your mother.
Come to me, son.

199
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:15,037
You are not my mother.
She's my mother.

200
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:22,137
You are right. She's
the one got this boon.

201
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:28,415
Son, not just those who gave
birth to you, but even those. .

202
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,646
. .who see you once in their
lifetime are fortunate ones.

203
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:35,415
Son, give me a chance to
take you into my arms. .

204
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:37,722
. .for a moment and pamper you.

205
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:39,959
Son, come to me once.

206
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,163
My son starts crying
when he is with strangers.

207
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,628
Please forgive me, queen.

208
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,866
Athiratha, you may go now.

209
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,781
Someone rightly said
that we shouldn't let. .

210
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:04,911
. .childless women hold our children.

211
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:09,054
She has cast an
evil eye on my child.

212
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:13,828
Radha.
- I cast off the evil eye from him.

213
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:15,689
She's an evil woman.
She's an evil woman.

214
00:18:15,932 --> 00:18:17,399
She can be the
queen of this kingdom. .

215
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:18,525
. . but she can't take
away my child from me.

216
00:18:18,802 --> 00:18:21,635
Radha, that's wrong.
- Yes. It's wrong.

217
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:24,498
Separating a mother
from her child is wrong.

218
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:26,607
How would she understand my pain !

219
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,409
You too won't
understand how much a mother. .

220
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:30,571
. .suffers when the child is crying.

221
00:18:30,947 --> 00:18:34,144
Radha, you can't forget the truth
because of your love.

222
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:36,408
We don't know who gave
birth to this child.

223
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:38,750
We got him at the banks of a river.

224
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:41,423
Lord, I touch your
feet and beg you. .

225
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:46,053
. . please do not talk about
that incident ever again.

226
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,158
My Karna is my life.

227
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:52,425
No matter whoever has
given birth to him. .

228
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:55,164
. .I won't let her come close to him.

229
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:14,681
''The saint was
pleased by her service and. . ''

230
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:21,457
''. .gave her a boon that she would
have children any time she wishes. ''

231
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:29,999
''She wanted to see. . ''

232
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:35,134
''. . if that saint meant his words. ''

233
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:46,679
''She prayered the lord. . ''

234
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:52,620
''. .and lord
prestended her with a child. ''

235
00:19:56,866 --> 00:20:02,168
''She couldn't enjoy the
bliss of motherhood. . ''

236
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:09,173
''. .and was scared
of the harsh world. ''

237
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:18,512
''With the fear of world. . ''

238
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:23,723
''. .she left her son in the Ganges. ''

239
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:31,794
''She left her son. . ''

240
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:38,664
''. .and wept for him
every living moment. ''

241
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:57,991
Dear, wise people
ignore what fools say.

242
00:20:58,861 --> 00:21:02,422
You shouldn't be upset
that someone else's child. .

243
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:04,796
. .didn't come to you.

244
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:06,762
I am not upset about that.

245
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:12,840
I am upset that God didn't
give me a child like him.

246
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:14,134
Do not worry, queen.

247
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:17,913
You will have a child
after we leave the forest.

248
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:22,547
We will have a big family.

249
00:21:23,486 --> 00:21:28,753
With God's wishes our house
will be filled with babies.

250
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:30,550
Come, dear.

251
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:43,498
Dear, due to my worries I
forgot to tell you this.

252
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:46,074
You are about to go to
hunting early in the morning.

253
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:47,735
Go and take rest.

254
00:22:24,814 --> 00:22:30,980
Lord. - You arrogant king,
you preyed on innocent people.

255
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:34,450
With your arrogance you predated. .

256
00:22:34,524 --> 00:22:37,618
. .on two saints who
renounced from the world.

257
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:40,459
I curse you that you will die. .

258
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:47,595
. .the moment you make
love with your life.

259
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:52,600
No. Can't I get rid
of this curse, saint?

260
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:55,535
Will my race end with me?
- No.

261
00:22:56,012 --> 00:23:00,711
Years ago a hunter
separated a pair of birds.

262
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:04,417
Valmiki saw that and
cursed that hunter. .

263
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:08,947
. .and then Ramayana
was born from his grief.

264
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:15,792
Your merciless act
can write history.

265
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:22,831
Do not worry. I will die
only if I come close to you.

266
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:25,434
If I take renouncement
from the worldly pleasures. .

267
00:23:25,475 --> 00:23:26,840
. .you won't become widows.

268
00:23:28,478 --> 00:23:30,844
Death can't come close
to me if I become a saint.

269
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:32,774
Atiratha.

270
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:37,519
You take my armory
back to the capital.

271
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:41,456
Inform the elders that I
have taken renouncement. .

272
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:43,048
. .along with my wives.

273
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:46,656
How unfortunate!
What have we done wrong !

274
00:23:47,163 --> 00:23:49,461
Why has God given this
punishment to Panduraja. .

275
00:23:49,532 --> 00:23:52,467
. .at this age! He should've
been ruling this kingdom. .

276
00:23:52,535 --> 00:23:55,595
. . but now he is leading his
life in the jungle. - Oh lord !

277
00:23:57,173 --> 00:23:59,698
Why has God done
this to Kunti's life?

278
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,879
Why has God done this to Himadri?

279
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:08,076
Why did they get
such harsh punishment?

280
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:13,012
Sister, you shouldn't get
upset when you should celebrate.

281
00:24:13,923 --> 00:24:16,414
You should be happy
that Kunti and Himadri. .

282
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:18,426
. .will be childless all their lives.

283
00:24:18,594 --> 00:24:23,156
My wish will come true when
you will give birth to a son.

284
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:27,561
All my efforts
will bear fruits then.

285
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,734
You got lord Shiva's
boon at a young age.

286
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,431
Offer prayers to lord
and ask him a boon. .

287
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:36,036
. .to give you 100 children, sister.

288
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,188
Kulekrusha, what's the rush?

289
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:54,588
Where are you going?

290
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:56,458
You are a saint.
First you stopped me. .

291
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:59,023
. .and then you are
asking me where I am going.

292
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:01,693
Don't you know that
Gandhari is about to be pregnant?

293
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:04,398
I know that. And I also know
that you are about to be born. .

294
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,907
. .from her womb as her eldest son.

295
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:08,067
Then why are you asking me
even after knowing that?

296
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:13,013
Mother earth will have
to earn a huge burden now.

297
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:14,677
Hail lord Narayana !
Hail lord Narayana !

298
00:25:17,086 --> 00:25:22,615
''O lord on the
seven-headed serpent. ''

299
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:28,022
''O incomprehensible being ! ''

300
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:35,633
''O destroyer of the demons. ''

301
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:38,634
''It's time you get up
and destroy the demons. . ''

302
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:43,801
''. .and save your beautiful world. ''

303
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:50,852
''Get up from your sleep! ''

304
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:59,184
Narada, what's the
reason for your turbulence?

305
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:01,392
It's natural. If the
demon takes birth on earth. .

306
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:03,398
. . before the birth
of your incarnation. .

307
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:05,093
. .then what will happen to earth !

308
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:07,525
Did he leave to take
birth from Gandhari's womb?

309
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:10,838
She's a faithful wife. He
can't enter inside her so easily.

310
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,735
He will enter into her
womb sooner or later.

311
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:15,402
If you don't take an
incarnation mother earth. .

312
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:17,810
. .can't take his burden.

313
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:19,879
In Dwapara age those who
were about to be born. .

314
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:21,040
Many of them have taken birth.

315
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,880
The demons, the destroyers,
everyone. .

316
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,420
The demons have taken
birth and their destroyers. .

317
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:28,480
. . have also reached the earth.

318
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:31,553
Mother earth is
waiting for your arrival.

319
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:34,156
Innocent Naradha,
you are omniscient.

320
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:37,527
You have already seen
who is killing whom.

321
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:40,959
What's the use if I take
birth on earth before Pandavas?

322
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:45,432
Narayana ! Narayana ! How
will Panduraju have children !

323
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:47,572
He is cursed, isn't he?

324
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,568
His wife Kunti has a boon.

325
00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:55,944
Remind it to them and
do a favor on world.

326
00:26:56,452 --> 00:26:57,510
Definitely.

327
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:10,994
''Lord Narayana, your
deeds are incomprehensible. ''

328
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:15,627
''With your blessings
Bharatam has taken birth. ''

329
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:18,097
''Bharatam has taken birth. ''

330
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:22,667
''Lord Narayana, your
deeds are incomprehensible. ''

331
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:27,507
''With your blessings
Bharatam has taken birth. ''

332
00:27:27,984 --> 00:27:29,884
''Bharatam has taken birth. ''

333
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:41,563
''The couple that was suffering
from the curse of the saint. . ''

334
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:46,424
''. .you reminded them
the way to have kids. ''

335
00:27:48,938 --> 00:27:53,671
''With the help of the chant
that the saint Narada told. . ''

336

Queen. Queen.
- Lord.

407

Queen, come into my arms.

408
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,760
You are cursed, lord.
- Queen.

409

Sister.
- Sister.

415

Sister, it's not my fault.

416

I reminded him of the curse.

417
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,877
I tried my best to stop him.

418
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:39,080
I tried my best to save
our husband's life, but. .

419
00:38:39,721 --> 00:38:40,779
But. .

420
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,889
Lord. Lord. O lord !

421
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:05,608
Why did you leave us alone?

422

Who will look after
our children, lord?

423
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:15,078
Will they become
fatherless so early in their lives!

424
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:17,683
O lord !

425
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:32,472
Lord, it's a wife's dharma to foll
ow her husband to heaven.

426
00:39:33,175 --> 00:39:35,871
Sister, call the priest.

427
00:39:36,845 --> 00:39:38,870
Make the arrangements for my
departure with my husband.

428
00:39:39,014 --> 00:39:43,144
Sister, it's not you, but I'm
the one who should go with him.

429
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:46,818
I am of reason behind of his death.

430
00:39:47,622 --> 00:39:49,749
I can't stay alive, lord.

431
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:53,151
I don't have the
strength to bring up our kids.

432
00:39:53,862 --> 00:39:57,093
You are the elder one. You
have to take that responsibility.

433
00:39:57,532 --> 00:40:01,969
Sister, if not for me, you will at
least have to live for our kids.

434
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:06,537
I am begging you. Please
give me your blessings.

435
00:40:08,777 --> 00:40:09,903
Sister.

436
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:38,964
Mother.

437
00:41:02,931 --> 00:41:03,989
Mother.

438
00:41:06,568 --> 00:41:09,867
Mother. Mother.

439
00:41:24,786 --> 00:41:26,014
Sister Dushala !

440
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:34,091
Whom are you
getting ready to worship?

441
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:37,623
You are about to
worship this prince?

442
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:39,457
Prince? You don't
even have a moustache. .

443
00:41:39,534 --> 00:41:41,798
. .and you want the kingdom.

444
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:44,469
You didn't even get
the prince's throne. .

445
00:41:44,506 --> 00:41:46,770
. .and you want me to worship you?

446
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:51,074
It's an insult to me.
Uncle Shakuni. - Nephew.

447
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:55,475
You said that you
would make me the king. .

448
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,485
. . no matter whoever
becomes the hurdle in my path. .

449
00:41:58,553 --> 00:42:00,487
. .and today this enemy of
mine is making fun of me.

450
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:02,153
And you are silent about it?

451
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:07,422
What you said is reasonable,
but it's not advisable. .

452
00:42:07,495 --> 00:42:08,962
. .to rush into things.

453
00:42:09,965 --> 00:42:16,131
If we rush into things now we
will have to pay for it later.

454
00:42:16,471 --> 00:42:17,938
You will never
succeed in your plans.

455
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,600
Arrogant girl, you
dared to insult our uncle?

456
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,038
I will punish you with this mace.

457
00:42:29,951 --> 00:42:32,010
Satyasena. Satyasena.

458
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:36,514
Take me to the reception
chamber right now. - Sister.

459
00:42:37,626 --> 00:42:40,789
So that you could
give reception to Kunti?

460
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:44,591
Yes, brother.
- Sister, it's wrong on your part.

461
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,468
Your son is about to be
enthroned as the prince. .

462
00:42:47,502 --> 00:42:51,461
. .and you are going
to receive Kunti. .

463
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:54,475
. .and her sons who
had a doubtful birth.

464
00:42:56,978 --> 00:43:00,414
As soon as those tribal
people step into this kingdom. .

465
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:04,418
. .your son will lose his
throne and you will be left with. .

466
00:43:04,486 --> 00:43:09,150
. .endless sorrows.
- Brother. Brother.

467
00:43:10,592 --> 00:43:14,153
Is that what would happen?

468
00:43:14,562 --> 00:43:15,654
I won't let it happen.

469
00:43:15,797 --> 00:43:18,891
I won't even let a
fly harm my nephew.

470
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,469
It's true. It's true.
- Your words are so comforting.

471
00:43:23,939 --> 00:43:27,636
Satyasena. Satyasena. We are
not going to the courtyard.

472
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:30,434
Sister, that's not right.
In politics the left hand. .

473
00:43:30,512 --> 00:43:34,915
. .shouldn't know what
the right hand does.

474
00:43:35,483 --> 00:43:38,452
You must shower her
with love from outside. .

475
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,819
. . but conspire against
her from inside. Go.

476
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:56,570
Sister. Kunti.
- Sister.

477
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:01,139
Kunti. Come, sister.

478
00:44:20,462 --> 00:44:22,123
Salutations to the king.

479
00:44:22,764 --> 00:44:25,426
Son, when the head of this
family Bheeshma is there. .

480
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,435
. .why did you salute me first?
- Lord, you are the king. .

481
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,439
. .and we are servants.
You must receive. .

482
00:44:31,473 --> 00:44:33,065
. .the first salutations.

483
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:36,470
A flower starts spreading
fragrance as soon as it's born.

484
00:44:36,978 --> 00:44:39,037
He got all the great
qualities of his father Panduraja.

485
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:42,443
God bless you.
Dhrutarastra, have you seen. .

486
00:44:42,517 --> 00:44:45,452
. .Yudhistar's manners!
Suyodhana, you must learn. .

487
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,115
. .such good manners
from your brother.

488
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,718
I need not learn
anything from others.

489
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:55,451
Suyodhana, if you don't know
the way to talk in courtyard. .

490
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,021
. .you should better keep quiet.

491
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,526
The prince knows the
etiquette of the court.

492
00:45:02,537 --> 00:45:04,095
So you already became the king?

493
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:07,798
Dharmaraja was born before
you. He's elder than you.

494
00:45:08,076 --> 00:45:09,805
He's the elder of this dynasty.

495
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:12,037
He will be the
successor of this kingdom.

496
00:45:12,981 --> 00:45:16,041
He will become the future king.
- I won't accept it.

497
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:20,453
Even if you don't accept
it that is what will happen.

498
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:23,417
It's wrong. The one who
returned from the forest. .

499
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:26,426
. .will get the throne
and the one who was born. .

500
00:45:26,494 --> 00:45:28,894
. . in the capital will be dethroned?
I can't tolerate it.

501
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,430
It doesn't matter if you
can tolerate it or not. .

502
00:45:31,499 --> 00:45:34,434
. . but as per dharma
Dharmaraja will be seated. .

503
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:38,929
. .on prince's throne. - What!
He will become the future king?

504
00:45:39,641 --> 00:45:42,439
We don't know when he was
born, where he was born. .

505
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,444
. .and to whom he was born,
and you call him. .

506
00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:47,106
. .the eldest of the kids?
- Shakuni !

507
00:45:47,816 --> 00:45:50,444
You can shut my mouth, but
you can't shut the mouth. .

508
00:45:50,518 --> 00:45:53,453
. .of this world. Before
the birth of these children. .

509
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:56,456
. .I heard that
Panduraju was cursed. .

510
00:45:56,524 --> 00:45:59,459
. .that he would die if
goes close to his wives.

511
00:45:59,794 --> 00:46:01,125
Then how were they born?

512
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:06,899
Who will believe it if you say he
is the father of these children?

513
00:46:07,535 --> 00:46:10,936
Who will accept it if that
child gets this kingdom!

514
00:46:11,906 --> 00:46:15,137
An illegitimate child
can't become the future king?

515
00:46:15,743 --> 00:46:18,610
The eldest of the Kauravas
deserves to get that throne.

516
00:46:19,414 --> 00:46:21,439
Suyodhana will be the
future king of this kingdom.

517
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:32,952
What's this quake? What does
this inauspicious sign means?

518
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:36,428
This is not new for us.
The moment your eldest son. .

519
00:46:36,498 --> 00:46:39,797
. . Suyodhana was born,
there vultures celebrated.

520
00:46:40,068 --> 00:46:42,434
And today when you are
thinking of making him the king. .

521
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,938
. .foxes are howling
and the earth is quaking.

522
00:46:46,574 --> 00:46:48,439
If you observe these
inauspicious signs. .

523
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,740
. . it seems that your son will
be the destroy of this dynasty.

524
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,448
Yes. If you
denounce him immediately. .

525
00:46:54,516 --> 00:46:58,043
. . it will save this
family from destruction.

526
00:46:58,453 --> 00:47:00,785
We need not punish anyone.

527
00:47:01,022 --> 00:47:02,387
Let there me
atonements and religious vows. .

528
00:47:02,457 --> 00:47:04,687
. .to get rid of
this auspicious signs.

529
00:47:04,993 --> 00:47:06,392
It would be appropriate if my sons. .

530
00:47:06,461 --> 00:47:08,554
. .and Panduraja's
sons live together.

531
00:47:08,897 --> 00:47:10,865
That's what is good for this family.

532
00:47:11,466 --> 00:47:13,400
Didn't you hear what
happened in the courtyard. .

533
00:47:13,468 --> 00:47:16,403
. .today? They are saying
that my son is the destroyer. .

534
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:18,405
. .of this family, and
that when he was born. .

535
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:21,408
. .vultures were celebrating,
and that today. .

536
00:47:21,476 --> 00:47:23,410
. .the foxes were howling.
That this kingdom. .

537
00:47:23,478 --> 00:47:25,969
. .will be in safe hands
if it's given to your son.

538
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,638
Then why do they need us here?

539
00:47:28,082 --> 00:47:30,414
I will hand you over
the comforts of kingdom. .

540
00:47:30,485 --> 00:47:33,579
. .and I will go to live
forest with my sons. - Sister.

541
00:47:34,923 --> 00:47:37,414
Had I known that we would
be hurting you so much. .

542
00:47:37,492 --> 00:47:39,551
. .we wouldn't have
returned to Hastinapur.

543
00:47:39,827 --> 00:47:42,421
The women of the royal family
can't go to live in the forest. .

544
00:47:42,497 --> 00:47:45,159
. .due to the issues
in the royal court.

545
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:49,436
Sister, I swear that
as long as I am alive. .

546
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,631
. .you will the king's mother.

547
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,068
Sister, your blessings are
very important for my sons and me.

548
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:58,172
Sister, I know your nature.

549
00:47:58,947 --> 00:48:01,381
I can give you my
blessings only if you assure me. .

550
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:04,384
. .that you will keep
your sons in your control. .

551
00:48:04,452 --> 00:48:07,387
. .and that the
differences between the cousin. .

552
00:48:07,455 --> 00:48:10,447
. .won't lead to
drastic consequences.

553
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:17,722
Sister, I want you to live
happily for hundred years.

554
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:19,397
I too want Kauravas and Pandavas. .

555
00:48:19,467 --> 00:48:20,934
. .to live harmoniously.

556
00:49:02,477 --> 00:49:05,605
Suyodhana, dare to stop me.

557
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:18,619
It's against the rules.
It's against the rules.

558
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:20,691
Shutting the nose is
against the rules.

559
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,624
You will get the
punishment for doing this mistake.

560
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:25,856
You can't play for some time.
- Who are you to punish me!

561
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:29,000
Questioning the
umpire is another mistake.

562
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:30,994
Get out of the line
of play immediately.

563
00:49:31,105 --> 00:49:34,006
I won't move.
- But still you will have to go.

564
00:49:35,076 --> 00:49:37,476
How arrogant! The hand
that is raised on my brother. .

565
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:39,513
. .will have to break into pieces.

566
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:41,981
Oh God !

567
00:50:02,837 --> 00:50:09,037
Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law.
I am your uncle Shakuni's son.

568
00:50:12,947 --> 00:50:14,005
Leave me.

569
00:50:14,582 --> 00:50:17,551
Mother. Mother.

570
00:50:18,086 --> 00:50:21,522
Mother. Mother.

571
00:50:21,956 --> 00:50:23,981
Mother. - What happened?
How did this happen?

572
00:50:24,492 --> 00:50:27,017
He broke my leg.

573
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:31,462
That evil Bheema twisted
my head and immersed me. .

574
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:34,695
. . in the water. . And. . Oh God !

575
00:50:35,803 --> 00:50:38,169
Bheema bashed all of us, brother.

576
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:41,074
You must have done something.

577
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:43,973
That's why he bashed you up.
- Sister.

578
00:50:44,946 --> 00:50:46,971
You shouldn't take the enemy's side.

579
00:50:47,148 --> 00:50:49,139
Mother, we haven't
done anything wrong.

580
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:51,478
I warned to behave themselves. .

581
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:54,715
. . in front of the future king
of this kingdom. That's all.

582
00:50:55,156 --> 00:50:58,057
And he bashed you up
for such a simple matter?

583
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:00,218
Oh God ! Oh God !

584
00:51:01,062 --> 00:51:04,657
That Bheema wanted to kill my sons.

585
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:08,765
This can't his idea.

586
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:12,733
It's Kunti who
must've instigated him.

587
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,432
Satyasena, come. We
will decide it right now. .

588
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:21,448
. . if Kunti or I will
stay in Hastinapur.

589
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,577
Mother, I taught them a lesson.

590
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:27,185
Now those hundred
brothers won't trouble us.

591
00:51:27,488 --> 00:51:31,822
It's wrong, son. They gave
us a shelter to live here.

592
00:51:32,493 --> 00:51:34,518
Do not forget that we are orphans.

593
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:37,487
Promise me that you won't
repeat such a thing again.

594
00:51:38,032 --> 00:51:40,592
Mother.
- Promise me, son.

595
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:43,761
Alright, mother.

596
00:51:43,971 --> 00:51:45,905
You are asking me
to control my anger?

597
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:49,134
I cannot bear it anymore.

598
00:51:49,644 --> 00:51:51,942
I will have to get that Bheema
thrown out of this province.

599
00:51:52,847 --> 00:51:53,939
Just out of the province?

600
00:51:56,884 --> 00:52:00,411
You think small.
Sister, throwing him out. .

601
00:52:00,488 --> 00:52:04,151
. .of this province
won't solve the problem.

602
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:07,426
Is that possible! Do you
have some other solution. .

603
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:11,124
. .to get rid of that demon?
- Yes, there is.

604
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:13,963
There is even a
single for the snake-bite.

605
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:15,459
Sister.

606
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,440
if you do as I say we will
get rid of the problem. .

607
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:23,943
. .called Bheema.
- Tell me.

608
00:52:24,479 --> 00:52:25,741
Tell me what I will have to do.

609
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:35,445
Brother Akrura, I didn't
know that kids' mischief. .

610
00:52:35,523 --> 00:52:39,186
. .will create
differences among the elders.

611
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:42,459
I try my best to keep
my children in control. .

612
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:45,522
. . but there is some fight
or other with their cousins.

613
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,468
Because of their
differences with their cousins. .

614
00:52:48,503 --> 00:52:50,664
. .I fear how the
future will turn out to be.

615
00:52:51,973 --> 00:52:55,739
This is something that
is deeply troubling me.

616
00:52:56,177 --> 00:52:58,202
God is there for those
who don't have anyone.

617
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:00,677
Sri Krishna is the
lord visible to everyone.

618
00:53:01,148 --> 00:53:02,547
His grace is eternal.

619
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:07,547
In Repalli, in Mathura, you will
find this statue in every house.

620
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:10,150
This is the statue
everyone's worshipping.

621
00:53:10,558 --> 00:53:14,756
Be his devotee and worship him.

622
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,032
Sister Kunti.
- Sister. You came here?

623
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:26,439
I would have come to your chamber. .

624
00:53:26,474 --> 00:53:28,442
. . had you called me there.
- Those who apologize. .

625
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:30,704
. .should go to those whom
they beg for forgiveness.

626
00:53:31,178 --> 00:53:33,112
Your sons and you must forgive us.

627
00:53:33,614 --> 00:53:34,672
What are you saying, sister!

628
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:37,951
You are elder than me. How
can you apologize to us!

629
00:53:38,786 --> 00:53:39,844
Because mother gets the punishment. .

630
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:40,979
. .for the kids' mistakes.

631
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:44,820
Suyodhana misbehaved
on the playground.

632
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:47,189
I told him that he should apologize.

633
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:49,794
He listened to me and
came here to apologize.

634
00:53:49,931 --> 00:53:51,592
Son. Suoyodhana.

635
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:56,993
Brother, forgive me.

636
00:53:59,974 --> 00:54:02,465
Bheema, you will
forgive me, won't you?

637
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:05,735
Suyodhana, I forgot what
happened a long time ago.

638
00:54:06,013 --> 00:54:08,914
Let bygones be bygones.

639
00:54:09,617 --> 00:54:12,415
I hope that the
affection towards each other. .

640
00:54:12,486 --> 00:54:14,545
. .stays there forever.
- I too want the same.

641
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:20,159
Sister, my children want to go
to the forest and also eat there.

642
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:23,160
Will you send your
children as well? - Sure.

643
00:54:23,965 --> 00:54:27,025
Dharmaja, go there with
your brothers. - Ok, mother.

How much can you
eat among the dishes?

678

Dushyasana, divide
the food in two parts.

None of us should eat these dishes.

has gone out of limits.

This is the right opportunity.

715
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:06,889
Tie him down and throw him
in the lake full of snakes.

01:14:50,123 --> 01:14:52,023
Grandfather,
what's the solution now?

836
01:14:52,192 --> 01:14:54,456
Do not worry. I am giving
you the boon that you can. .

837
01:14:58,064 --> 01:15:00,999
Bheema, come back
to your normal size.

838
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:03,401
Hail Kaka Aryaka !

839
01:15:09,776 --> 01:15:11,403
Hail Kaka Aryaka !

840
01:15:20,053 --> 01:15:21,543
Hail Kaka Aryaka !

841
01:15:30,029 --> 01:15:32,429
Grandfather, mother
will be very happy. .

842
01:15:32,498 --> 01:15:35,729
. .when she will see the
divine powers I got. - Yes, son.

843
01:15:35,969 --> 01:15:38,631
If you permit me I
shall go home now.

844
01:15:39,138 --> 01:15:42,130
Alright, son. Your
mother is worried about you.

845
01:15:42,609 --> 01:15:43,667
You shall go now.

846
01:15:45,011 --> 01:15:46,478
Mother, Bheema is here.

847
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,877
Bheema is here? Bheema is here?

848
01:15:52,952 --> 01:15:55,011
Mother.
- Bheema - Mother.

849
01:15:55,088 --> 01:15:56,680
Bheema
- Mother.

850
01:15:56,756 --> 01:15:59,020
You are back, son? You are back.

851
01:15:59,726 --> 01:16:03,594
Son, I was so worried
when you went missing.

852
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:07,524
You scared me, son.
You really scared me.

853
01:16:08,434 --> 01:16:09,924
Do not cry, mother. Do not cry.

854
01:16:10,136 --> 01:16:12,502
Mother, look how
many diamonds I brought.

855
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:20,404
I will worship your
feet with these, mother.

856
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:29,479
Son. Bheema.

857
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:33,423
Mother, I drank snake-nectar
in Nagalok( snake-world). .

858
01:16:33,493 --> 01:16:35,688
. .and got huge strength, mother.

859
01:16:35,995 --> 01:16:39,931
With this power I will
destroy all my enemies, mother.

860
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:41,523
Son, do not rush into anything.

861
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:43,432
No, mother. We
shouldn't forgive them.

862
01:16:43,636 --> 01:16:46,434
That day they mixed poison in my
food during the feast in the forest. .

863
01:16:46,472 --> 01:16:49,066
. .and tied me with ropes
and threw me in the lake.

864
01:16:53,513 --> 01:16:54,741
Who told you so, son !

865
01:16:55,581 --> 01:16:57,014
And also, who would
believe these words?

866
01:16:57,483 --> 01:16:59,451
Your great grandfather king Aryaka. .

867
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,419
. .told me in the Nagalok.

868
01:17:03,056 --> 01:17:05,991
King Aryaka?
- Yes, mother. He said that. .

869
01:17:06,459 --> 01:17:08,393
Don't tell anyone about it, son.
- Mother!

870
01:17:08,761 --> 01:17:11,855
Yes. You must behave
as if nothing happened.

871
01:17:12,031 --> 01:17:14,397
What are you saying, mother!
You want me to hide the truth?

872
01:17:14,634 --> 01:17:15,726
You shouldn't.

873
01:17:17,503 --> 01:17:19,027
No one can hide the truth.

874
01:17:20,406 --> 01:17:21,737
No one can.

875
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:26,472
Kunti, you are a
woman of great integrity.

876
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:28,413
But if we don't curb
the sins there can be. .

877
01:17:28,481 --> 01:17:30,711
. .disastrous consequences.

878
01:17:31,784 --> 01:17:33,411
If we can't mould a plant. .

879
01:17:33,486 --> 01:17:35,750
. .then we can never mould
it when it becomes a tree.

880
01:17:36,689 --> 01:17:38,486
The culprits must be
found and punished.

881
01:17:38,558 --> 01:17:41,493
Vidhura, call for a royal
meeting tomorrow morning.

882
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:45,425
Dhrutarastra, you have to
take come harsh decisions. .

883
01:17:45,498 --> 01:17:47,056
. . in the courtyard today.

884
01:17:51,037 --> 01:17:54,438
First of all decide that you
will take some tough decisions. .

885
01:17:54,507 --> 01:17:57,772
. .and we hear what happened.
- As you say.

886
01:17:58,444 --> 01:18:00,036
Everything is
quite surprising to me.

887
01:18:00,546 --> 01:18:02,377
I can't believe that
my son Suyodhana. .

888
01:18:02,448 --> 01:18:04,746
. .can do such a thing. I can't
believe it. I can't believe it.

889
01:18:05,651 --> 01:18:07,380
Dhrutarastra, emotional
attachments in courtyard. .

890
01:18:07,453 --> 01:18:09,580
. . lead to drastic consequences.

891
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,390
It's your dharma to
forgot your blood ties. .

892
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:14,426
. .and punish the culprit.

893
01:18:19,132 --> 01:18:20,394
This can't just be
the deed of the kids. .

894
01:18:20,433 --> 01:18:23,925
. . but there might be some
elders' evil intentions behind it.

895
01:18:24,537 --> 01:18:27,529
That's why the culprits
must get the punishment.

896
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:30,534
I am unable to understand it.

897
01:18:30,977 --> 01:18:32,501
You pass the verdict.

898
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:34,838
Alright.

899
01:18:35,148 --> 01:18:38,117
Suyodhana, what did you
during the feast in the forest?

900
01:18:39,819 --> 01:18:40,877
Why aren't you saying anything !

901
01:18:41,554 --> 01:18:43,886
Don't you have words to
explain your evil deeds?

902
01:18:44,157 --> 01:18:46,421
It's injustice. Even
before passing the verdict. .

903
01:18:46,492 --> 01:18:49,518
. .you cannot call
his deeds evil deeds.

904
01:18:50,129 --> 01:18:53,565
Suyodhana, do not be scared.
Tell him as it is.

905
01:18:56,035 --> 01:18:58,833
So you already told him what to say.

906
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:03,805
Dhrutarastra, Shakuni will
spoil your son. Be careful.

907
01:19:04,477 --> 01:19:06,911
Why is this gathering called !

908
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:10,707
To talk about what happened or
to predict what will happen?

909
01:19:11,784 --> 01:19:13,149
Both are important, Shakuni.

910
01:19:13,786 --> 01:19:15,720
Suyodhana, tell us
what you did that day.

911
01:19:15,788 --> 01:19:18,484
I tried to do a good deed
and I am accused of this crime.

912
01:19:18,691 --> 01:19:20,090
I don't know anything.
- You don't know anything?

913
01:19:21,761 --> 01:19:24,457
First you commit crimes and
then you lie in the court?

914
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:26,998
Tell me the truth.
- Lord. Lord.

915
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:30,201
Lord, will you punish
my son with the sword?

916
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:33,000
Have mercy on me and
don't destroy my legacy.

917
01:19:33,606 --> 01:19:37,474
Dhrutarastra, it's because of
you and to save your legacy. .

918
01:19:37,543 --> 01:19:41,479
. .I took the oath to
stay unmarried all my life. .

919
01:19:41,547 --> 01:19:45,483
. .and not to have children, so
that you can sit on this throne. .

920
01:19:45,551 --> 01:19:48,645
. .and be the king of Hastinapur.

921
01:19:48,888 --> 01:19:50,480
It's only to save your
legacy that I am staying here. .

922
01:19:50,556 --> 01:19:52,490
. . in this kingdom and
looking after the daily affairs. .

923
01:19:52,558 --> 01:19:53,684
. .of this kingdom.

924
01:19:54,527 --> 01:19:56,495
It's only for you that I
got your father remarried. .

925
01:19:56,562 --> 01:19:58,154
. .with king Kashi's daughter.

926
01:19:58,965 --> 01:20:02,423
I made you the
king of this kingdom. .

927
01:20:02,468 --> 01:20:07,132
. .only to save your legacy,
but not to ruin it.

928
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,436
Dhrutarastra, as
much as I protect you. .

929
01:20:12,512 --> 01:20:17,643
. .I will punish your
sinful, immoral sons.

930
01:20:18,184 --> 01:20:21,915
If he accepts his evil
deed I will forgive Suyodhana.

931
01:20:22,188 --> 01:20:24,679
Suyodhana, he never
goes back on his word.

932
01:20:24,957 --> 01:20:26,447
Touch his feet and
tell him the truth.

933
01:20:26,592 --> 01:20:29,026
Save your life and my life,
son. Save our lives.

934
01:20:31,063 --> 01:20:33,588
Tell me the truth.
- Alright, it was a mistake.

935
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:40,867
Mistake? Is searching for
poison purposely a mistake?

936
01:20:41,474 --> 01:20:44,807
Is mixing it in
Bheema's food a mistake?

937
01:20:45,111 --> 01:20:48,478
Or tying him and
throwing him in a lake. .

938
01:20:48,548 --> 01:20:53,485
. .to hide your evil deed a sin?
What's a mistake? Tell me.

939
01:20:54,987 --> 01:20:58,582
How unfortunate! I can't
see this. I can't see this.

940
01:20:59,025 --> 01:21:01,493
Suyodhana, do not have any
doubts. Tell him the truth.

941
01:21:06,532 --> 01:21:10,628
Yes, I searched for
poison to kill Bheema.

942
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:13,438
I mixed in his food.
- Did you get this idea. .

943
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:16,134
. .or did someone
asked you to do this?

944
01:21:16,842 --> 01:21:18,673
No one told me to do this.

945
01:21:19,946 --> 01:21:26,010
I conspired against Bheema
as he is stronger than me.

946
01:21:26,485 --> 01:21:28,043
It's my mistake. Forgive me.

947
01:21:28,921 --> 01:21:31,446
Don't touch my feet.
Touch Bheema's feet.

948
01:21:34,894 --> 01:21:40,457
Bheema, forgive my mistake.
- Suyodhana, elders forgive us.

949
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:41,690
But it's not me.

950
01:21:41,801 --> 01:21:43,462
Because of you I was
able to drink snake-nectar. .

951
01:21:43,502 --> 01:21:46,938
. .and gained immense strength.

952
01:21:47,173 --> 01:21:48,731
For that I thank you.

953
01:21:50,142 --> 01:21:53,475
Suyodhana, Dharmaja is
the eldest of you all. .

954
01:21:53,546 --> 01:21:56,811
. .and he's the one who has
the rights to forgive you.

955
01:21:57,550 --> 01:22:01,418
Give him a hug and say you
will live harmoniously. .

956
01:22:01,487 --> 01:22:05,150
. .and play together
and never fight again.

957
01:22:05,725 --> 01:22:09,889
Brother. - Suyodhana,
you need not say anything.

958
01:22:10,162 --> 01:22:12,460
From today onwards
we are 105 brothers.

959
01:22:18,638 --> 01:22:21,766
'Offense. Offense. It's an insult. '

960
01:22:22,508 --> 01:22:27,002
'Instead of leading such life
it would be far better to die. '

961
01:22:27,513 --> 01:22:30,778
'It would be far better to die. '

962
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:33,785
Suyodhana. Suyodhana.
- Leave me. Leave me.

963
01:22:38,124 --> 01:22:40,456
Suyodhana, it's the way of
the wise to kill oneself. .

964
01:22:40,526 --> 01:22:42,994
. .every time there is a trouble.

965
01:22:43,529 --> 01:22:45,156
You need not die till
I am there with you.

966
01:22:45,965 --> 01:22:49,457
I felt really proud of you
when you hid the truth. .

967
01:22:49,502 --> 01:22:52,767
. . in faced the insult in the
courtroom. I am proud of you.

968
01:22:53,673 --> 01:22:56,540
If possible I will make you
the emperor of this kingdom.

969
01:22:57,543 --> 01:23:01,411
Pandavas might have
respect in this kingdom. .

970
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,473
. . but we have the power of
these numbers. See this.

971
01:23:07,953 --> 01:23:09,716
Suyodhana, ask me for a number.

972
01:23:09,789 --> 01:23:15,785
Do not doubt. You can see
what the result will be.

973
01:23:16,962 --> 01:23:18,020
Six.

974
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:25,128
Three.

975
01:23:30,776 --> 01:23:38,478
Have you seen this! These
dices will get you the throne.

976
01:23:39,485 --> 01:23:41,680
My dices will come to your rescue.

977
01:23:44,957 --> 01:23:46,515
Gandhara-kumara !

978
01:23:50,029 --> 01:23:52,463
I know why you came to Hastinapur. .

979
01:23:52,531 --> 01:23:57,798
. .and why you settled
at this place forever.

980
01:23:58,571 --> 01:24:01,404
In the past when all
your men were dead. .

981
01:24:02,475 --> 01:24:06,036
. .you took rescue in
the homes of the poor.

982
01:24:06,612 --> 01:24:10,514
Shakuni, I can see the
evil behind those eyes.

983
01:24:11,417 --> 01:24:14,409
Even if this kid hides the
truth about your involvement. .

984
01:24:14,487 --> 01:24:17,650
. . in Bheema's poisoning,
this old man knows it.

985
01:24:18,157 --> 01:24:22,423
I didn't want to kill
you in the courtroom. .

986
01:24:22,495 --> 01:24:27,865
. .and hurt your
sister and brother-in-law.

987
01:24:28,968 --> 01:24:30,936
Your intelligence is
higher than the sky.

988
01:24:31,971 --> 01:24:33,939
Couldn't you
understand such a simple matter?

989
01:24:34,073 --> 01:24:35,506
You want me to believe it?

990
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:39,442
Shakuni, keep on thing in
mind that I can't bear it. .

991
01:24:39,512 --> 01:24:43,448
. . if you try to destroy
the kingdom I have built. .

992
01:24:43,516 --> 01:24:47,646
. . right in front of my eyes.

993
01:24:48,187 --> 01:24:53,489
Suyodhana, you must
befriend kids of your age.

994
01:24:53,826 --> 01:24:56,522
Go. Go and play with your brothers.

995
01:24:56,595 --> 01:25:00,156
Enjoy the songs and
dance of your sister. Go. Go!

996
01:25:22,955 --> 01:25:27,983
''O Krishna ! O Krishna !
You are our lord. ''

997
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:33,496
''You are the supreme lord.
You are the dharma. ''

998
01:25:33,766 --> 01:25:38,635
''O Krishna ! O Krishna !
You are our lord. ''

999
01:25:38,737 --> 01:25:43,902
''You are the supreme lord.
You are the dharma. ''

1000
01:26:02,895 --> 01:26:05,386
''Gods and demons. . ''

1001
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:07,929
''. .searched for the ocean of milk. ''

1002
01:26:12,605 --> 01:26:17,668
''Gods and demons
searched for the ocean of milk. ''

1003
01:26:19,578 --> 01:26:24,538
''Then nectar was born
and everyone got greedy. ''

1004
01:26:32,591 --> 01:26:34,991
''What did you do then?''

1005
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:40,029
''He took the form of a lady
and that grace and that aura. . ''

1006
01:26:40,165 --> 01:26:42,656
''. .and smiled mischievously. ''

1007
01:26:42,935 --> 01:26:45,529
''What else have you done?''

1008
01:26:46,672 --> 01:26:51,439
''You distributed the nectar
among the deserving ones. ''

1009
01:26:51,911 --> 01:26:57,850
''And you gave a big zero
to the arrogant ones. ''

1010
01:26:59,184 --> 01:27:03,917
''O Krishna ! O Krishna !
You are our lord. ''

1011
01:27:04,523 --> 01:27:09,392
''You are the supreme lord.
You are the dharma. ''

1012
01:27:24,143 --> 01:27:28,603
''A demon was proud of
conquering Indra's kingdom. ''

1013
01:27:29,648 --> 01:27:33,914
''To destroy his arrogance,
lord Hari turned into a dwarf. ''

1014
01:27:37,423 --> 01:27:42,417
''Lord Hari went to him and
asked him for three feet land. ''

1015
01:27:45,431 --> 01:27:50,027
''And he destroyed Shukra's eye who
tried to be a hurdle on his path. ''

1016
01:27:50,469 --> 01:27:55,133
''He destroyed his eye. ''

1017
01:27:55,774 --> 01:28:01,872
''And then grew in size.
- And then?''

1018
01:28:02,414 --> 01:28:05,383
''And then he covered
earth with one feet. . ''

1019
01:28:05,684 --> 01:28:08,380
''. .and covered sky
with another feet. . ''

1020
01:28:08,887 --> 01:28:13,824
''. .and then with the third
feet he crushed Bali into hell. ''

1021
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:21,698
''O Krishna ! O Krishna !
You are our lord. ''

1022
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:26,803
''You are the supreme lord.
You are the dharma. ''

1023
01:28:37,616 --> 01:28:39,846
''Brothers, did you hear. . ''

1024
01:28:40,152 --> 01:28:42,620
''. .the tales of young Krishna?''

1025
01:28:42,921 --> 01:28:45,116
''If there is no envy and jealousy. . ''

1026
01:28:45,491 --> 01:28:47,925
''. .everyone's life
will be beautiful. ''

1027
01:28:53,098 --> 01:28:58,058
''If we don't listen to others,
we will live in peace. ''

1028
01:29:00,839 --> 01:29:05,742
''If brothers live together,
everyone will be happy. ''

1029
01:29:05,811 --> 01:29:10,976
''And if God is there with us,
then our lives will become heaven. ''

1030
01:29:11,183 --> 01:29:15,813
''O Krishna ! O Krishna !
You are our lord. ''

1031
01:29:16,121 --> 01:29:20,820
''You are the supreme lord.
You are the dharma. ''

1032
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:25,688
''You are the dharma. ''

1033
01:29:25,998 --> 01:29:30,162
''You are the dharma. ''

1034
01:29:56,995 --> 01:30:00,123
Oh ! It's too deep.
What shall we do now?

1035
01:30:00,432 --> 01:30:02,093
Bheema is the
reason behind all this.

1036
01:30:02,367 --> 01:30:04,733
What was the need
throw you so much force?

1037
01:30:05,003 --> 01:30:07,494
Do you want me to throw it
like a skinny guy like you?

1038
01:30:07,706 --> 01:30:09,298
Ok, wait. There is no need to fight.

1039
01:30:09,441 --> 01:30:12,342
First of all let us
find a way to take it out.

1040
01:30:12,644 --> 01:30:15,010
It's too deep. How
do we take it out?

1041
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:18,738
We have to tie someone with
a rope and put him inside it.

1042
01:30:19,017 --> 01:30:20,416
You are right.
Viluka will be apt for us.

1043
01:30:20,486 --> 01:30:23,011
He's very light. We
can pull him easily.

1044
01:30:23,388 --> 01:30:26,380
Oh God ! Leave me. I
won't get into the well.

1045
01:30:26,525 --> 01:30:29,016
Viluka, do not get scared. I'm here.

1046
01:30:29,194 --> 01:30:32,254
I will hold the rope tight.
- And where's the rope?

1047
01:30:32,498 --> 01:30:35,490
Let's use the bands on our bodies. .

1048
01:30:35,567 --> 01:30:37,057
. .and tie them. It will
be as long as we want.

1049
01:30:37,703 --> 01:30:39,000
Bring your bands.

1050
01:30:40,405 --> 01:30:44,671
Viluka is running away. Hold him.
- Oh God ! Oh God !

1051
01:30:44,977 --> 01:30:51,075
No. No. I will die.

1052
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:54,608
Leave me. Leave me.

1053
01:30:55,387 --> 01:30:59,289
Leave me. I'm scared. I'm scared.

1054
01:30:59,358 --> 01:31:01,326
Leave me. Leave me.

1055
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,994
Stop it. Stop it.
What's going on over there!

1056
01:31:04,062 --> 01:31:05,461
Why are you throwing
that kid into the well?

1057
01:31:06,565 --> 01:31:08,999
You came here like God.
They are throwing me. .

1058
01:31:09,067 --> 01:31:12,696
. . into the well to take
out the ball. Please help me.

1059
01:31:13,038 --> 01:31:14,699
Is there no other way
to take out the ball?

1060
01:31:21,213 --> 01:31:26,412
You look like princes. Haven't
your master taught you archery?

1061
01:31:26,752 --> 01:31:28,014
Salutations to the saint,
but what is the relation. .

1062
01:31:28,086 --> 01:31:30,213
. . between archery and the ball.

1063
01:31:30,522 --> 01:31:33,548
He who is good at
archery can do anything.

1064
01:31:34,293 --> 01:31:36,955
Anything is possible for him.

1065
01:31:37,329 --> 01:31:38,387
See this.

1066
01:32:04,523 --> 01:32:07,720
Brother-in-law, what a great talent!

1067
01:32:08,227 --> 01:32:10,457
Saint Krupacharya, who
is this great saint?

1068
01:32:10,629 --> 01:32:12,062
He's my
brother-in-law saint Dhronacharya.

1069
01:32:14,199 --> 01:32:16,224
Brother-in-law.
- Brother-in-law. - Brother.

1070
01:32:16,735 --> 01:32:19,727
How are you, sister?
- What shall I tell you, brother!

1071
01:32:20,339 --> 01:32:22,000
Your brother has
acquired mastery in archery. .

1072
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,406
. . but we still have problems
in earning for a survival.

1073
01:32:25,043 --> 01:32:27,011
We don't even have enough
means to buy milk for our son. .

1074
01:32:27,079 --> 01:32:29,013
. .and here we are
wandering all over the world.

1075
01:32:30,616 --> 01:32:32,607
A master archer is
such a poor state?

1076
01:32:33,018 --> 01:32:34,952
Had he gone to any kingdom
he would've been received. .

1077
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:36,954
. .with open arms!
- But it's not in his nature. .

1078
01:32:37,022 --> 01:32:39,081
. .to go to someone
to ask for something.

1079
01:32:39,992 --> 01:32:42,961
Even when he went to the
great saint Parasurama. .

1080
01:32:43,028 --> 01:32:45,963
. . he accepted fruits
that he offered him. .

1081
01:32:46,031 --> 01:32:49,296
. . but he couldn't tell him
about his dire financial condition.

1082
01:32:50,535 --> 01:32:52,093
You are saint Parasurama's disciple?

1083
01:32:52,571 --> 01:32:53,970
He's my master as well.

1084
01:32:54,273 --> 01:32:57,674
Dhroncharya, thus we become
brothers. Fellow-disciples.

1085
01:32:58,076 --> 01:33:00,977
Do not say no to us and
kindly come to our kingdom. .

1086
01:33:01,046 --> 01:33:04,982
. .and teach our
princes the art of archery.

1087
01:33:07,019 --> 01:33:08,077
Do not think too much
about it, brother-in-law.

1088
01:33:08,353 --> 01:33:10,514
I have taught them all
the arts that I knew.

1089
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:13,121
Now you must teach them archery.

1090
01:33:13,692 --> 01:33:16,286
Please accept Bheeshma's offer.
- Alright.

1091
01:33:17,162 --> 01:33:19,995
There's nothing more
pleasurable in this world. .

1092
01:33:20,065 --> 01:33:21,999
. .than teaching. I
would be happy to teach. .

1093
01:33:22,067 --> 01:33:24,228
. .the deserving kids.
- We are happy.

1094
01:33:25,237 --> 01:33:29,139
Disciples, first of all I need
to test your present skills.

1095
01:33:30,008 --> 01:33:32,340
Look there. There's
a bird on that tree.

1096
01:33:32,678 --> 01:33:35,340
I want you to take aim on
the right eye of that bird.

1097
01:33:36,315 --> 01:33:37,373
Suyodhana.

1098
01:33:45,223 --> 01:33:46,281
Take aim at the bird's eye.

1099
01:33:48,527 --> 01:33:51,018
Can you see the tree?
- Yes, I can see the tree.

1100
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:52,954
Can you see the branch?
- I can see the branch. .

1101
01:33:53,031 --> 01:33:55,056
. .and I can also see the sky.

1102
01:33:56,034 --> 01:33:58,400
The bird?
- What are these questions, master?

1103
01:33:58,704 --> 01:34:01,468
My parents can't see,
but I can see very well.

1104
01:34:01,506 --> 01:34:03,997
You can? I don't think so.

1105
01:34:04,309 --> 01:34:06,971
Suyodhana, he who
doesn't obey his master. .

1106
01:34:07,045 --> 01:34:10,105
. .can never be a good student.

1107
01:34:10,349 --> 01:34:12,078
You can't leave this art. Go away.

1108
01:34:14,987 --> 01:34:17,046
Bheema.
- Yes, master.

1109
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:25,125
Can you see the bird?
- Yes, master. I can see the bird.

1110
01:34:25,497 --> 01:34:28,489
Branch?
- I can also see the branch, master.

1111
01:34:28,734 --> 01:34:31,362
Bird?
- I can see it very well, master.

1112
01:34:31,436 --> 01:34:35,429
Bheema, you can't master
the art of archery. Go away.

1113
01:34:37,075 --> 01:34:38,167
As you order, master.

1114
01:34:39,411 --> 01:34:40,469
Arjuna.

1115
01:34:55,694 --> 01:34:57,389
Can you see the tree?
- No.

1116
01:34:58,363 --> 01:34:59,455
Branch?
- No.

1117
01:35:01,299 --> 01:35:02,357
Bird?
- No.

1118
01:35:03,001 --> 01:35:04,059
Then what's visible to you?

1119
01:35:04,102 --> 01:35:07,299
Bird's right eye is visible to me,
master. - Then hit the bird.

1120
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:20,315
Disciples, did you know it
now how to take your aim?

1121
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:23,051
You must also take aim like Arjun.

1122
01:35:23,255 --> 01:35:25,519
Salutations, my lord. Salutations.

1123
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:30,686
My son is dying to
learn archery from you.

1124
01:35:31,363 --> 01:35:34,264
Kindly make him your disciple.
- Who are you?

1125
01:35:34,332 --> 01:35:35,526
My name is Vasadi Singari.

1126
01:35:36,001 --> 01:35:38,936
In my village I am
known as Hiranyadamyu. .

1127
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:41,268
. .and my son is known as Ekalavya.

1128
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:43,940
You are the right teacher for him.

1129
01:35:44,276 --> 01:35:46,005
I am sorry, but you
are from a lower caste.

1130
01:35:46,078 --> 01:35:49,013
It's against dharma
to teach you archery.

1131
01:35:49,514 --> 01:35:53,450
Master, my son came
here with lot of hope.

1132
01:35:54,386 --> 01:35:55,978
Kindly do not break his dreams.

1133
01:35:56,188 --> 01:36:00,022
I cannot help you. I cannot
teach someone against dharma.

1134
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:03,025
Lord, I came here with many dreams.

1135
01:36:03,361 --> 01:36:05,420
I cannot think
anyone else as my teacher.

1136
01:36:05,597 --> 01:36:08,259
Have mercy on me
and teach me archery.

1137
01:36:08,633 --> 01:36:11,363
I beg you. Kindly do not say no.

1138
01:36:12,704 --> 01:36:15,400
I cannot go against dharma.
I cannot teach you.

1139
01:36:15,974 --> 01:36:18,568
Master, I treated you as my teacher.

1140
01:36:18,643 --> 01:36:20,975
I will make your
statue and worship you. .

1141
01:36:21,046 --> 01:36:25,506
. .and learn archery on my own.
Give me your blessings, lord.

1142
01:36:26,718 --> 01:36:31,314
Alright. You can do that.
Fulfill your wish.

1143
01:36:56,982 --> 01:36:58,472
Great, my son.

1144
01:37:00,285 --> 01:37:02,253
Today you made me proud.

1145
01:37:18,403 --> 01:37:21,167
Nakula. Sahadeva. Remove the fire.

1146
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,949
What's that sound in the darkness?

1147
01:37:40,992 --> 01:37:42,926
Forgive me, lord. I am
trying to achieve mastery. .

1148
01:37:42,994 --> 01:37:45,428
. . in the art of hitting the
target in the dark. - Great. Great.

1149
01:37:45,664 --> 01:37:47,325
How did you think of it, son?

1150
01:37:47,399 --> 01:37:48,923
Once at night during dinnertime. .

1151
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,936
. .the candles went off,
and since I saw the dishes. .

1152
01:37:52,971 --> 01:37:58,568
. .that were there on the
leaf I could eat in the dark.

1153
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:02,946
And I realized that we can hit
the target even in the dark.

1154
01:38:03,014 --> 01:38:04,174
Great, Arjuna. Great.

1155
01:38:04,249 --> 01:38:05,944
Your dexterity is matchless.

1156
01:38:06,318 --> 01:38:08,946
I will teach you
everything that I have learnt.

1157
01:38:09,087 --> 01:38:12,056
There won't be a better
archer than you in this world.

1158
01:38:12,123 --> 01:38:13,181
It's my oath.

1159
01:38:52,030 --> 01:38:54,999
Duryodhana, you cannot hit
a person below his waist. .

1160
01:38:55,066 --> 01:38:57,432
. . in the mace-war. It's
against rules. Keep that in mind.

1161
01:38:57,502 --> 01:38:58,526
Alright, master.

1162
01:39:33,605 --> 01:39:37,268
Duryodhana, it's wrong. You
did it intentionally this time.

1163
01:39:37,442 --> 01:39:38,534
It is unpardonable.

1164
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:41,010
How can it be wrong when I did
it for self-defense, master!

1165
01:39:41,079 --> 01:39:43,047
You are arguing with me. It's wrong.

1166
01:39:43,248 --> 01:39:44,476
I am saying this for your welfare.

1167
01:39:44,649 --> 01:39:45,980
If you do such kind
of immoral things. .

1168
01:39:46,051 --> 01:39:48,986
. . it will be harmful to you in
future. That's sufficient for today.

1169
01:39:50,255 --> 01:39:55,283
In the mace-war Bheema has
beaten up my son mercilessly.

1170
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,118
There are wounds all over his body.

1171
01:39:57,395 --> 01:40:00,990
You said that that arrogant Bheema. .

1172
01:40:01,066 --> 01:40:05,628
. . is as strong as Naga.
How will my son fight him!

1173
01:40:06,538 --> 01:40:09,006
I wonder what will happen to my son.

1174
01:40:09,341 --> 01:40:14,005
Do not worry, sister. If Bheema
has as much strength as Naga. .

1175
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:19,278
. .we will get
Suyodhana as tougher body.

1176
01:40:20,118 --> 01:40:22,086
I made arrangements for that.

1177
01:40:22,387 --> 01:40:24,150
You need not worry anymore.

1178
01:40:24,689 --> 01:40:25,747
Aghori.

1179
01:40:29,561 --> 01:40:33,622
Queen Gandhari, take
Amruta-Varshini's blessings.

1180
01:40:42,474 --> 01:40:44,965
Aghori, explain it to
her how the prince's body. .

1181
01:40:45,043 --> 01:40:48,171
. .will become as hard as iron.

1182
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:53,110
Abracadabra.

1183
01:40:59,023 --> 01:41:02,652
Here are those
invaluable leaves and roots.

1184
01:41:03,361 --> 01:41:05,693
On the festive day, at mid-night. .

1185
01:41:06,064 --> 01:41:08,259
. .while worshiping
mother Amruta-Varshini. .

1186
01:41:08,333 --> 01:41:13,532
. .you have to crush these roots
and leaves and with your hands. .

1187
01:41:14,105 --> 01:41:17,541
. .you have to apply that extract
on each part of your son's body. .

1188
01:41:18,209 --> 01:41:20,177
. .and his body
will become iron-hard.

1189
01:41:21,413 --> 01:41:26,009
I am blessed. - Sister,
tomorrow it's an auspicious day.

1190
01:41:26,284 --> 01:41:29,185
You can perform this
vow tomorrow itself.

1191
01:41:29,654 --> 01:41:33,385
It's my responsibility
to bring Suyodhana here.

1192
01:41:33,691 --> 01:41:36,455
Welcome, saint Valmiki.

1193
01:41:37,228 --> 01:41:39,560
Your arrival has made
our monastery auspicious.

1194
01:41:40,031 --> 01:41:41,965
Our disciples are also blessed.
They got an opportunity. .

1195
01:41:42,033 --> 01:41:45,400
. .to showcase their
talent in front of you.

1196
01:41:45,503 --> 01:41:47,266
Today my wishes have come true.

1197
01:41:48,206 --> 01:41:52,700
I wanted to see all
these disciples together.

1198
01:41:53,678 --> 01:41:55,509
He is my chief disciple Balarama.

1199
01:41:56,581 --> 01:41:59,675
He is Sudhama.
People call him Kuchela.

1200
01:42:00,185 --> 01:42:04,519
Accept our salutations.
- Give us your blessings.

1201
01:42:09,093 --> 01:42:12,028
Please accept it as a gift from us.
- I am pleased to receive it.

1202
01:42:14,232 --> 01:42:18,430
Dharmaja, take it. Share
it with your brothers.

1203
01:42:21,105 --> 01:42:22,197
Saint.

1204
01:42:25,176 --> 01:42:26,575
Vayu-nandana( son of
wind-God), greetings!

1205
01:42:27,078 --> 01:42:29,012
Cousin, you
recognized me even before. .

1206
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:31,446
. .I could introduce myself!

1207
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:34,350
We don't need
introductions from sun and moon.

1208
01:42:35,019 --> 01:42:36,213
Arjuna.
- Cousin.

1209
01:42:36,688 --> 01:42:40,180
Son of mother Devaki.
- I am very pleased.

1210
01:42:40,492 --> 01:42:44,121
I am pleased that
you are a mace-fighter.

1211
01:42:44,429 --> 01:42:45,487
Suyodhana.

1212
01:42:49,367 --> 01:42:51,961
Master ordered us to share
this fruit among ourselves.

1213
01:42:52,303 --> 01:42:54,567
Brother, make two
halves of this fruit.

1214
01:42:54,606 --> 01:42:57,097
We'll get one half and the
Kauravas will get the other half.

1215
01:42:57,175 --> 01:42:59,973
What are you saying ! The five
of you will get one piece each. .

1216
01:43:00,044 --> 01:43:01,978
. .and the rest of the fruit
will be ours. - No. - Yes.

1217
01:43:03,214 --> 01:43:04,306
Krishna, come here.

1218
01:43:05,617 --> 01:43:07,983
You already started
creating differences between them.

1219
01:43:08,052 --> 01:43:10,987
What have I done, brother?
- Today you are making them. .

1220
01:43:11,055 --> 01:43:12,989
. .fight for a fruit,
tomorrow you will make them fight. .

1221
01:43:13,057 --> 01:43:15,548
. .for the kingdom.
- No, brother.

1222
01:43:15,727 --> 01:43:17,285
Do not make such
baseless accusations on me.

1223
01:43:17,362 --> 01:43:19,523
Krishna, I know you very well.

1224
01:43:19,731 --> 01:43:22,632
Suyodhana, you know how it
feels to get beaten up by me.

1225
01:43:23,067 --> 01:43:25,228
If you trouble me, I
will bash you up again.

1226
01:43:25,737 --> 01:43:28,297
Bheema, you shouldn't
fight with your brother.

1227
01:43:28,706 --> 01:43:31,231
Suyodhana, you can have this fruit.

1228
01:43:31,676 --> 01:43:33,667
If you want to give us,
you can give us a share.

1229
01:43:42,353 --> 01:43:45,948
Krishna, you are the father,
mother, guru, god. .

1230
01:43:46,024 --> 01:43:49,551
. .and everything for my children.

1231
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:53,190
It's your
responsibilities to look after them.

1232
01:43:53,698 --> 01:43:56,064
That's my dharma. You
can live peacefully.

1233
01:43:56,434 --> 01:43:57,492
May I go now?

1234
01:44:01,172 --> 01:44:03,265
Hail Mother Amruta-varshini !

1235
01:44:11,683 --> 01:44:14,447
Satyasena. Satyasena.
- Yes, sister-in-law.

1236
01:44:15,053 --> 01:44:18,113
Is it not mid-night yet? Hasn't
the auspicious moment arrived yet?

1237
01:44:18,189 --> 01:44:20,123
No, sister-in-law.
There still some time left.

1238
01:44:21,159 --> 01:44:23,719
Is Suyodhana here? Is he
getting ready? - Yes, he is.

1239
01:44:24,729 --> 01:44:25,991
Look, Satyasena. No one
other than Suyodhana. .

1240
01:44:26,064 --> 01:44:28,396
. .can come here.

1241
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,964
Go and close the gates.
- Alright, sister-in-law.

1242
01:44:38,676 --> 01:44:45,445
Aunt Gandhari, accept
Krishna's salutations.

1243
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:48,942
It's Krishna?
- Yes. - Welcome, son.

1244
01:44:49,287 --> 01:44:51,949
You came here after a long time,
but I'm not in a position. .

1245
01:44:52,023 --> 01:44:54,491
. .to give you a good reception.
I am in the middle of the vow.

1246
01:44:54,692 --> 01:44:56,387
Aunt, you need not
worry about the reception.

1247
01:44:56,694 --> 01:44:58,218
It's enough if you are
happy to see me here.

1248
01:44:58,529 --> 01:45:01,157
By the way, what's that vow about?

1249
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,295
It's a ladies' vow, son.

1250
01:45:06,004 --> 01:45:07,494
Krishna.
- Yes, aunt.

1251
01:45:07,672 --> 01:45:08,969
I heard that you have
a great understanding. .

1252
01:45:09,007 --> 01:45:11,237
. .about the political
affairs of the kingdom.

1253
01:45:11,676 --> 01:45:15,976
Son, the envious world
might tell you some lies. .

1254
01:45:16,047 --> 01:45:20,984
. .about my son. I want you
to help my spotless sons. .

1255
01:45:21,052 --> 01:45:26,354
. .when they are in trouble.

1256
01:45:26,691 --> 01:45:28,659
I am always on the
side of dharma, aunt.

1257
01:45:29,093 --> 01:45:30,424
Sister-in-law, the
auspicious time is passing by.

1258
01:45:30,695 --> 01:45:32,993
She is right. You
should complete your vow.

1259
01:45:33,064 --> 01:45:34,122
Shall I go now?

1260
01:45:41,539 --> 01:45:43,632
Satyasena.
- Sister-in-law.

1261
01:45:44,308 --> 01:45:47,072
Did he leave?
- Yes.

1262
01:45:47,445 --> 01:45:50,642
Close that door and
call Suyodhana. Go.

1263
01:46:03,594 --> 01:46:05,960
Brother. Brother.

1264
01:46:07,565 --> 01:46:10,329
What's this! Why did
you remove your clothes?

1265
01:46:10,401 --> 01:46:12,096
Dushala, what are you doing here?

1266
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:15,667
This is my chamber.
What are you doing here?

1267
01:46:16,074 --> 01:46:19,009
Suyodhana, come fast.
- Go there.

1268
01:46:19,077 --> 01:46:21,978
The auspicious time is passing by.
- Suyodhana.

1269
01:46:31,155 --> 01:46:36,024
Son, from today onwards your
body will become as hard as iron.

1270
01:46:36,994 --> 01:46:39,929
Even if the mountains
crush you, you won't die.

1271
01:46:41,299 --> 01:46:44,166
Bheema has great strength.

1272
01:46:44,669 --> 01:46:51,199
He won't be able to do anything
now. After touching your body. .

1273
01:46:52,276 --> 01:46:55,336
. . his mace will be
broken into pieces.

1274
01:46:58,116 --> 01:47:01,950
What's this! I
ordered you to come here. .

1275
01:47:02,019 --> 01:47:05,045
. . removing all your clothes.
- You are right.

1276
01:47:05,323 --> 01:47:07,951
But I felt ashamed to
remove all my clothes. .

1277
01:47:08,025 --> 01:47:09,959
. . in front of that Dushala.
- O lord !

1278
01:47:11,562 --> 01:47:14,224
What have I done wrong in my vow!

1279
01:47:15,233 --> 01:47:17,326
Will your thighs always be weak?

1280
01:47:19,403 --> 01:47:20,461
How unfortunate!

1281
01:47:29,013 --> 01:47:31,914
Greetings. Offer my salutations. .

1282
01:47:31,983 --> 01:47:35,180
. .to the king of Gandhara.
- O Krishna !

1283
01:47:35,486 --> 01:47:37,647
Your greetings have won my heart.

1284
01:47:37,722 --> 01:47:40,418
I learnt greetings people from you.

1285
01:47:41,325 --> 01:47:42,383
Goodbye.

1286
01:47:48,266 --> 01:47:52,259
I never knew that my own
daughter will be our enemy.

1287
01:47:53,171 --> 01:47:54,934
How can she do such a thing !

1288
01:47:55,039 --> 01:47:57,371
There she is. She's
coming here with uncle.

1289
01:47:58,142 --> 01:47:59,200
Dushala !

1290
01:48:00,077 --> 01:48:02,272
Why are you shouting at me!
What have I done wrong?

1291
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:04,940
You can't do anything worse.
- You came to the chamber. .

1292
01:48:05,016 --> 01:48:10,545
. .and stood in front of me.
- You had spoilt all my wishes.

1293
01:48:10,655 --> 01:48:13,954
What are you saying, sister!
In order to avoid such mishap. .

1294
01:48:14,025 --> 01:48:16,550
. .I felt her with me all day long.

1295
01:48:20,464 --> 01:48:26,460
Now I understood it. This
is Krishna's conspiracy.

1296
01:48:28,973 --> 01:48:34,707
Saint Dhronacharya,
your reception is great.

1297
01:48:35,146 --> 01:48:36,443
Shall we go now?

1298
01:48:38,349 --> 01:48:42,581
Balarama, where is Krishna? Krishna.

1299
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:45,989
Arjuna, you must be the best in
this art form. - Alright, cousin.

1300
01:48:46,157 --> 01:48:48,352
I will be the best in archery.

1301
01:48:49,126 --> 01:48:52,687
Foolish cousin, a better archer
is there in this forest itself.

1302
01:48:53,164 --> 01:48:55,223
Take your master's
permission and go to hunting.

1303
01:48:55,333 --> 01:48:56,391
You will know it on your own.

1304
01:49:16,187 --> 01:49:19,122
Lift it. Lift it.

1305
01:49:23,527 --> 01:49:26,189
Stop there. This is our province.

1306
01:49:26,364 --> 01:49:28,730
To hunt here you need to
take our permission first.

1307
01:49:29,166 --> 01:49:31,361
Who are you? This is our kingdom.

1308
01:49:31,469 --> 01:49:32,697
We will do whatever we wish.

1309
01:49:33,004 --> 01:49:35,495
I just warned you, if you
still don't listen to me. .

1310
01:49:35,673 --> 01:49:38,665
What will you do? If you don't
stop talking we will hunt you.

1311
01:49:39,176 --> 01:49:40,234
Is that so!

1312
01:49:47,118 --> 01:49:48,710
Fire. Fire.

1313
01:49:49,153 --> 01:49:52,213
Master. Master. Help! Help!

1314
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:55,587
Master. Master. Help! Help!

1315
01:49:58,129 --> 01:50:00,063
Fire. Fire.

1316
01:50:00,264 --> 01:50:02,198
Arjuna, use the
rain-arrow and put off that fire.

1317
01:50:03,134 --> 01:50:06,001
Fire. Fire.
- Hail the master!

1318
01:50:07,405 --> 01:50:08,997
Fire. Fire.

1319
01:50:09,507 --> 01:50:11,998
Fire. Fire.

1320
01:50:13,544 --> 01:50:15,637
Rain. Rain.

1321
01:50:28,292 --> 01:50:30,089
Master, give me your blessings.

1322
01:50:30,528 --> 01:50:31,961
Ekalavya, it's you? From
which master did you achieve. .

1323
01:50:32,029 --> 01:50:33,690
. .such proficiency in archery?

1324
01:50:34,131 --> 01:50:37,999
The master who taught you
has taught me these skills.

1325
01:50:38,302 --> 01:50:39,667
Saint Dhrona is my master.
- It's me?

1326
01:50:40,004 --> 01:50:42,666
I taught you the archery?
- Yes, lord. Yes.

1327
01:50:43,074 --> 01:50:45,099
I built your statue and
treated it as my master.

1328
01:50:45,376 --> 01:50:47,344
I worshiped you day and night.

1329
01:50:47,511 --> 01:50:51,971
You always kept whispering
your invaluable guidance. .

1330
01:50:52,049 --> 01:50:53,107
. . in my ears.

1331
01:50:57,488 --> 01:50:59,718
'There won't be a better
archer than you in this world. '

1332
01:50:59,991 --> 01:51:01,049
'It's my oath. '

1333
01:51:01,392 --> 01:51:04,987
Master, it's only because I
built your statue and worshipped it. .

1334
01:51:05,062 --> 01:51:07,257
. .that I mastered
the art of archery.

1335
01:51:07,498 --> 01:51:09,159
Kindly come to my
house and honor it.

1336
01:51:09,367 --> 01:51:11,426
It's an auspicious day. My
master came to my province.

1337
01:51:11,602 --> 01:51:13,729

1338

''My master is here. ''

1342
01:51:56,580 --> 01:52:01,279
''My master came to our province.
It's a delight for the eyes. ''

1343
01:52:28,245 --> 01:52:32,614
''He came here for the
first time. He is my master. ''

1344
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:37,387
''He came here for the
first time. He is my master. ''

1345
01:52:37,521 --> 01:52:41,981
''I shall bring the Ganges
here and wash his feet. ''

1346
01:52:48,632 --> 01:52:53,695
''I shall bring the Ganges
here and wash his feet. ''

1347
01:52:54,071 --> 01:53:00,670
''I will blow the drums.
I will ring the bells. ''

1348
01:53:03,347 --> 01:53:10,651
''I will blow the drums. I will ring
the bells. I will blow the conches. ''

1349
01:53:12,323 --> 01:53:16,726

''He's the greatest master.
No one is as good as he is. ''

1352
01:54:01,372 --> 01:54:06,002
''I learn everything from him. ''

1353
01:54:08,345 --> 01:54:12,543
''There is no such
person in this world. ''

1354
01:54:12,683 --> 01:54:17,484
''We shall worship him one by one. ''

1355
01:54:18,155 --> 01:54:20,715
''We shall worship him one by one. ''

1356
01:54:29,266 --> 01:54:34,033
''We shall offer him our lives. ''

1357
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:40,670
''Here it is. Here it is.
The festive season is here. ''

1358
01:54:40,945 --> 01:54:45,177
''My master is here. ''

1359
01:54:45,316 --> 01:54:47,477
''My master came to our province.
It's a delight for the eyes. ''

1360
01:55:30,327 --> 01:55:33,228
Master, this is your disciple.
This is our land.

1361
01:55:33,430 --> 01:55:37,526
And these are our men. Tell me what
I shall offer you. I will give you.

1362
01:55:37,635 --> 01:55:39,330
You won't go back on your
word after I ask you, right?

1363
01:55:40,271 --> 01:55:42,933
Master, if your disciple
goes back on his word. .

1364
01:55:42,973 --> 01:55:45,203
. . it will be an insult to you.

1365
01:55:45,442 --> 01:55:48,240
And your disciple
will never let you down.

1366
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:54,949
Then cut your right thumb
and give it to me as my fee.

1367
01:55:55,452 --> 01:55:58,182
Is that all? I will offer it to
you from the bottom of my heart.

1368
01:55:58,322 --> 01:56:01,223
I will give it to
you right now. Saint.

1369
01:56:01,558 --> 01:56:03,321
This is not right on your part.

1370
01:56:03,594 --> 01:56:08,088
Asking for his thumb is
like asking for his head.

1371
01:56:08,666 --> 01:56:11,191
After teaching him the
art do not waste it.

1372
01:56:11,602 --> 01:56:13,092
You can ask for anything else.

1373
01:56:13,370 --> 01:56:15,565
Take my finger. Take my
land. Take my reputation.

1374
01:56:15,973 --> 01:56:18,999
I will offer you
everything that I have, saint.

1375
01:56:20,577 --> 01:56:24,513
I will offer you my tears.

1376
01:56:26,684 --> 01:56:30,620
Have mercy on my son.
Have mercy on him.

1377
01:56:34,625 --> 01:56:36,923
Father, you are
the one who told me. .

1378
01:56:36,994 --> 01:56:39,929
. .that one should not
go back on his word. .

1379
01:56:39,997 --> 01:56:44,229
. .and death would be
better than doing that.

1380
01:56:45,169 --> 01:56:47,933
If your son doesn't
offer him what he asked for. .

1381
01:56:47,971 --> 01:56:49,131
. . it will bring defame to you.

1382
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:53,167
I cannot let you down, father.

1383
01:56:53,944 --> 01:56:55,434
I have to fulfill master's wish.

1384
01:56:55,579 --> 01:56:59,948
Wipe out your tears and
bring a smile on your face. .

1385
01:57:00,017 --> 01:57:02,281
. .and help me offer him my finger.

1386
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:04,954
Yes, son. Yes.

1387
01:57:05,989 --> 01:57:09,083
You are my son. You
will never say no.

1388
01:57:09,626 --> 01:57:10,684
You will never say no.

1389
01:57:12,329 --> 01:57:16,959
I might not know why you
asked for such a thing. .

1390
01:57:17,034 --> 01:57:20,970
. .why you become so merciless. .

1391
01:57:21,004 --> 01:57:24,531
. . but lord definitely knows it.

1392
01:57:25,476 --> 01:57:30,345
You will definitely
bear the consequences.

1393
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:58,268
Why did you do such a thing !

1394
01:57:59,276 --> 01:58:02,609
Why did you bring such a
scar on your spotless life!

1395
01:58:03,347 --> 01:58:06,407
I never knew that you
would behave so ruthlessly.

1396
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:08,008
Fate is the most ruthless.

1397
01:58:09,286 --> 01:58:14,246
There is a strong reason
behind every action of a human.

1398
01:58:14,691 --> 01:58:17,956
It's God's wish. Even the
best of the human beings. .

1399
01:58:18,028 --> 01:58:22,658
. .can't go against their destiny.

1400
01:58:24,968 --> 01:58:26,265
Do not worry about my deed.

1401
01:58:27,070 --> 01:58:33,976
Witness the great
talent of my disciples.

1402
01:58:34,044 --> 01:58:35,170
Come with me.

1403
01:58:52,029 --> 01:58:53,997
The future king of this kingdom. .

1404
01:58:54,064 --> 01:58:56,999
. .the eldest son of the dynasty,
queen Kunti's son Dharmaja. .

1405
01:58:57,067 --> 01:59:00,036
. . is about to showcase his skills.

1406
01:59:01,205 --> 01:59:05,574
He has already crowned
Dharmaja as the king.

1407
01:59:06,276 --> 01:59:07,436
It's just his love for him, sister.

1408
01:59:07,511 --> 01:59:08,569
Dharmaja.

1409
01:59:35,973 --> 01:59:38,965
Now Bheema and
Suyodhana will participate. .

1410
01:59:39,042 --> 01:59:42,136
. . in the mace-fight.
Bheema. Suyodhana.

1411
02:00:20,617 --> 02:00:22,175
Suyodhana, great!

1412
02:00:26,423 --> 02:00:27,583
Great, brother!

1413
02:00:28,759 --> 02:00:32,092
Who's winning?
- Sister, it's not a battle.

1414
02:00:32,629 --> 02:00:33,960
It's just to showcase their skills.

1415
02:00:34,031 --> 02:00:36,022
There is no question
of winning or losing.

1416
02:00:36,099 --> 02:00:37,964
That's not possible. When
two people are fighting. .

1417
02:00:38,001 --> 02:00:39,992
. .only one person can win the fight.

1418
02:00:46,243 --> 02:00:48,177
Save yourself, Bheema. I
will break your hands.

1419
02:00:49,212 --> 02:00:50,372
I will break your head.

1420
02:00:51,582 --> 02:00:54,142
They are baying for
each other's blood.

1421
02:00:54,217 --> 02:00:57,152
Ashwadhama, go there and stop them.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1422
02:00:57,321 --> 02:01:00,188
Master ordered you to
stop the fight. Stop it.

1423
02:01:04,661 --> 02:01:05,992
I am punishing you
for not listening. .

1424
02:01:06,063 --> 02:01:09,692
. .to your master's order.
Get out of the field.

1425
02:01:20,377 --> 02:01:24,006
Now the great archer
Arjuna will showcase. .

1426
02:01:24,081 --> 02:01:28,074
. . his archery skills. Arjuna.

1427
02:02:02,319 --> 02:02:04,048
What happened? What happened?

1428
02:02:04,621 --> 02:02:07,112
My son has set fire
with his archery skills.

1429
02:02:11,461 --> 02:02:15,124
Hail Arjuna !
- What happened now?

1430
02:02:15,399 --> 02:02:17,993
Arjuna put off the
flames with the rain-arrow.

1431
02:02:19,136 --> 02:02:21,604
I am proud of
Arjuna's archery skills.

1432
02:02:22,305 --> 02:02:24,500
There is no better
archer in this world.

1433
02:02:24,574 --> 02:02:26,337
No. There is one.

1434
02:02:28,011 --> 02:02:30,002
If you give me a chance I
will prove it to everyone. .

1435
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:31,206
. .that I am a better
archer than Arjuna.

1436
02:02:31,548 --> 02:02:33,948
Who is your master? - Which
master teaches the birds flying. .

1437
02:02:34,017 --> 02:02:36,952
. .the fishes swimming? Who
is the master of the flowers. .

1438
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:40,581
. .which emit fragrance
and the volcanic mountains?

1439
02:02:41,258 --> 02:02:44,955
God is the master of
all the living beings.

1440
02:02:45,028 --> 02:02:47,121
He is my master.

1441
02:03:13,690 --> 02:03:18,992
Great. First he created
clouds and then he dispersed them.

1442
02:03:20,497 --> 02:03:21,987
Saint, do you accept it
now that I am better. .

1443
02:03:22,065 --> 02:03:23,999
. .than your disciple?
Give us your permission. .

1444
02:03:24,034 --> 02:03:26,525
. .to fight each other
and showcase our skills.

1445
02:03:28,205 --> 02:03:30,139
Give him a chance.
- Give him a chance.

1446
02:03:31,942 --> 02:03:34,934
Why are you silent, saint?
- I know the meaning. .

1447
02:03:35,011 --> 02:03:38,947
. .of the saint's silence.
Karna, princes fight. .

1448
02:03:39,015 --> 02:03:43,281
. .only with the equals, but
they don't fight with others.

1449
02:03:43,587 --> 02:03:44,679
It's against their dharma.

1450
02:03:45,255 --> 02:03:46,313
You can tell which caste and
tribe you belong to. .

1451
02:03:46,389 --> 02:03:47,447
. .and then you can fight Arjuna.

1452
02:03:51,962 --> 02:03:53,020
Why are you silent?

1453
02:03:55,165 --> 02:03:56,962
It's injustice. To
save Arjuna from him. .

1454
02:03:57,033 --> 02:03:59,661
. .the saints are shielding
Arjuna with this excuse.

1455
02:04:00,303 --> 02:04:04,967
Saint Krupa, he who is
born in high caste. .

1456
02:04:05,041 --> 02:04:09,239
. .and he who has courage
and army is called a king.

1457
02:04:09,579 --> 02:04:10,637
Father.

1458
02:04:15,719 --> 02:04:19,348
Father, I heard that there
is no king in Anga territory.

1459
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:22,991
I beg you to make
Karna the king of Anga. .

1460
02:04:23,059 --> 02:04:26,119
. . let him give a fair
chance to showcase his skills.

1461
02:04:27,430 --> 02:04:29,990
What do you say?
- Giving someone a fair chance. .

1462
02:04:30,066 --> 02:04:34,435
. .to showcase his
skills is not wrong.

1463
02:04:35,238 --> 02:04:36,330
Give him your permission.

1464
02:04:38,008 --> 02:04:40,943
Right now, at this
stage I am making. .

1465
02:04:41,011 --> 02:04:44,276
. . Karna the king of Anga.

1466
02:04:45,315 --> 02:04:47,283
Hail king Karna of Anga !

1467
02:04:47,517 --> 02:04:50,179
Hail king Karna of Anga !

1468
02:04:50,253 --> 02:04:52,687
Hail king Karna of Anga !

1469
02:04:57,694 --> 02:05:01,323
Arjuna, I, the king of Anga am
challenging you to fight me.

1470
02:05:01,965 --> 02:05:05,594
If you have the courage to
fight me, you can step forward.

1471
02:05:07,404 --> 02:05:10,066
So you think you are a king?
You are challenging me?

1472
02:05:10,407 --> 02:05:13,205
You got pride as soon
as you got the crown?

1473
02:05:13,577 --> 02:05:18,071
Your pride will also
disappear like the disappearing sun.

1474
02:05:19,649 --> 02:05:23,483
The sun is setting. We
shall stop it here today.

1475
02:05:23,553 --> 02:05:26,078
Aswadhama, ask them to
blow the final horn.

1476
02:05:35,332 --> 02:05:38,130
Karna, from today
onwards we are friends.

1477
02:05:38,168 --> 02:05:40,636
Our friendship
shall survive forever.

1478
02:05:40,971 --> 02:05:43,940
How can I forget you who
rescued me at the right time. .

1479
02:05:43,974 --> 02:05:45,532
. .and made me the king !

1480
02:05:46,076 --> 02:05:50,137
I will offer my life,
skills, fame and everything to you.

1481
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:52,339
I swear on the Sun-God.

1482
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,211
Salutations to the king.

1483
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:07,561
Mother, my friend Karna,
the king of Anga. .

1484
02:06:07,631 --> 02:06:10,293
. . is offering you salutations.
Give him your blessings.

1485
02:06:10,367 --> 02:06:14,201
Salutations, mother.
- You fame may raise manifold, son.

1486
02:06:17,607 --> 02:06:20,371
Son. Karna. Come here, son.

1487
02:06:22,979 --> 02:06:25,709
Take your mother's blessings.
- What!

1488
02:06:26,650 --> 02:06:28,641
My enemy's mother is blessings me?

1489
02:06:29,386 --> 02:06:31,911
If sons fight each other
people will accuse the mother. .

1490
02:06:31,988 --> 02:06:33,387
. .of improper upbringing, son.

1491
02:06:34,190 --> 02:06:36,317
I want everyone to live happily.

1492
02:06:37,594 --> 02:06:41,997
May you lead a happy life, son.

1493
02:06:44,968 --> 02:06:46,060
Mother.

1494
02:06:48,438 --> 02:06:50,429
King of Anga, come
with me. We shall go now.

1495
02:06:53,276 --> 02:06:54,334
Radha.

1496
02:06:58,081 --> 02:07:00,481
Cast off the evil eye from
your son as soon as you go home.

1497
02:07:00,550 --> 02:07:01,608
Definitely.

1498
02:07:11,027 --> 02:07:12,961
Mother, your son won the battle. .

1499
02:07:13,029 --> 02:07:15,623
. .and you are shedding tears?

1500
02:07:16,099 --> 02:07:17,566
These are the tears
of happiness, son.

1501
02:07:22,272 --> 02:07:23,364
Stop the chariot.

1502
02:07:29,579 --> 02:07:32,173
What's this? - There are
the presents for the master.

1503
02:07:32,449 --> 02:07:34,917
We were waiting for
these. Give it to us.

1504
02:07:35,251 --> 02:07:36,912
Not to you, but your
Bheeshma said that. .

1505
02:07:36,987 --> 02:07:39,922
. . Dharmaja should
present them to your master. .

1506
02:07:39,990 --> 02:07:41,048
. .on behalf of all the disciples.

1507
02:07:42,392 --> 02:07:43,984
Has grandfather become mad?

1508
02:07:44,127 --> 02:07:45,924
When the future king of
this kingdom is here. .

1509
02:07:45,996 --> 02:07:47,987
. .why did he ask that
Dharmaja to go this honor!

1510
02:07:48,264 --> 02:07:52,064
Pandavas are
surviving here on our mercy.

1511
02:07:52,936 --> 02:07:55,336
Brothers, get hold of the presents.

1512
02:08:01,411 --> 02:08:04,471
How arrogant! He dared to go
against grandfather's order!

1513
02:08:04,614 --> 02:08:09,074
They will regret it
later. You stay calm.

1514
02:08:24,601 --> 02:08:28,970
Master, accept these diamonds,
these ornaments. .

1515
02:08:29,005 --> 02:08:34,966
. .this wealth as fee and
give this courageous prince. .

1516
02:08:35,045 --> 02:08:37,980
. .and his brothers your blessings. .

1517
02:08:38,048 --> 02:08:39,709
. . before we leave this place.

1518
02:08:43,653 --> 02:08:44,984
Where are the Pandavas?
- They are the poor. .

1519
02:08:45,055 --> 02:08:46,989
. .who cannot give you any
presents. They must be. .

1520
02:08:47,057 --> 02:08:48,991
. .ashamed of themselves and
must have left this place. .

1521
02:08:49,059 --> 02:08:51,527
. .without informing anyone.
- I know Pandavas well.

1522
02:08:52,195 --> 02:08:53,992
They will never step
out of this place. .

1523
02:08:54,064 --> 02:08:55,395
. .without their master's permission.

1524
02:08:58,201 --> 02:09:01,432
May your fame increase manifold !

1525
02:09:04,307 --> 02:09:07,003
Arjuna, you are your
master's favorite disciple.

1526
02:09:07,077 --> 02:09:09,409
Why are you so upset?
- That's the reason, mother.

1527
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:12,742
Master said that there will
not be a better disciple than me.

1528
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:16,014
But Ekalavya gave him
the invaluable fee. .

1529
02:09:16,086 --> 02:09:17,747
. .and left me far behind, mother.

1530
02:09:18,488 --> 02:09:22,015
We are unable to
understand what we should. .

1531
02:09:22,092 --> 02:09:24,083
. . present our master as fee.

1532
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:29,024
I cannot tell you what he wants,
but there is something. .

1533
02:09:29,099 --> 02:09:33,092
. .that has made him
upset since a long time.

1534
02:09:33,369 --> 02:09:35,963
What is that?
- When Ashwadhama was an infant. .

1535
02:09:36,005 --> 02:09:41,966
. .our condition was so bad
that we couldn't even afford. .

1536
02:09:42,045 --> 02:09:46,709
. .a glass of milk and I
couldn't bear this poverty.

1537
02:09:48,051 --> 02:09:49,985
Your master and Panchala's
king got education together. .

1538
02:09:50,053 --> 02:09:51,247
. .from the same master.

1539
02:09:52,255 --> 02:09:55,986
He said that he can even
give half of his kingdom. .

1540
02:09:56,059 --> 02:09:57,720
. . if your master ever needs it.

1541
02:09:58,661 --> 02:10:02,654
I reminded your master of that
word and sent him to that king.

1542
02:10:03,666 --> 02:10:04,724
Then. .

1543
02:10:07,437 --> 02:10:12,272
I am king Dhrupata
whose fame is spread. .

1544
02:10:13,409 --> 02:10:16,742
. .across the world. And you
will tell me what I should do?

1545
02:10:18,014 --> 02:10:20,073
You came here to ask me for help?

1546
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:23,280
You will get nothing.

1547
02:10:26,289 --> 02:10:29,019
You arrogant king, you
will definitely get punished. .

1548
02:10:29,092 --> 02:10:33,426
. .for this insult. Then you
will learn what you've done wrong.

1549
02:10:33,496 --> 02:10:34,554
I assure you of that.

1550
02:10:34,631 --> 02:10:37,964
He couldn't punish him till now.

1551
02:10:39,302 --> 02:10:41,202
And he is suffering from that pain.

1552
02:11:31,487 --> 02:11:34,945
Father, your son returned
after mastering all the arts. .

1553
02:11:35,024 --> 02:11:37,015
. .and offering you his salutations.

1554
02:11:38,294 --> 02:11:39,955
Mother, I returned after offering. .

1555
02:11:40,029 --> 02:11:41,428
. .the invaluable
presents to my master.

1556
02:11:42,565 --> 02:11:46,501
Suyodhana, where are the Pandavas?

1557
02:11:46,603 --> 02:11:49,265
Didn't you all offer
the presents together?

1558
02:11:49,372 --> 02:11:51,966
They didn't come with us.
We waited for them. .

1559
02:11:52,041 --> 02:11:54,976
. . but when they didn't come
we gave away the presents. .

1560
02:11:55,044 --> 02:11:56,238
. .and came back.

1561
02:11:57,580 --> 02:12:00,447
Our soldiers said that
they went out of this kingdom.

1562
02:12:25,675 --> 02:12:28,200
Master, this is what you
wanted since a long time.

1563
02:12:28,344 --> 02:12:30,005
We took your revenge as the fee.

1564
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:33,412
Please accept our fee
and give us your blessings.

1565
02:12:33,483 --> 02:12:37,544
Arjuna, today my
teaching has borne fruits.

1566
02:12:38,288 --> 02:12:39,687
Who is he?

1567
02:12:40,023 --> 02:12:42,355
You are the same king. .

1568
02:12:42,425 --> 02:12:45,417
. .who fame is spread across
the world? Are you king Dhrupata?

1569
02:12:46,296 --> 02:12:51,495
You are lying at the
feet of a poor man?

1570
02:12:52,502 --> 02:12:55,562
Friend Dhronacharya, forgive me.

1571
02:12:56,472 --> 02:12:59,032
I became arrogant
because of my throne.

1572
02:13:00,043 --> 02:13:03,638
Forgive me.
- Arjuna, untie him.

1573
02:13:04,647 --> 02:13:06,114
Hail the master!

1574
02:13:18,394 --> 02:13:21,989
King Dhrupada, though I
regret that you were. .

1575
02:13:22,065 --> 02:13:26,001
. . brought to our kingdom
in this manner I am happy. .

1576
02:13:26,035 --> 02:13:28,595
. .that your childhood
friendship has renewed.

1577
02:13:29,639 --> 02:13:32,938
Lord Bheeshma, I am happy
that I got an opportunity. .

1578
02:13:33,009 --> 02:13:35,671
. .to see you, even though
it's in these circumstances.

1579
02:13:36,079 --> 02:13:38,946
King of Panchala, my grandchildren. .

1580
02:13:39,015 --> 02:13:40,949
. . imprisoned you only to
take their master's revenge. .

1581
02:13:41,017 --> 02:13:42,951
. . but they don't have any
personal enmity against you.

1582
02:13:43,286 --> 02:13:45,220
Arjuna.
- Grandfather.

1583
02:13:45,621 --> 02:13:50,024
Ask him forgiveness.
- Forgive me, king.

1584
02:13:51,494 --> 02:13:53,962
Son, your dynasty
who got you as a son. .

1585
02:13:54,030 --> 02:13:56,965
. .and my friend Dhronacharya
who got you as his disciple. .

1586
02:13:57,033 --> 02:13:58,364
. .are blessed.

1587
02:13:59,969 --> 02:14:04,338
Son, I wish I had a son like you.

1588
02:14:05,108 --> 02:14:07,576
I would've been blessed.

1589
02:14:08,044 --> 02:14:10,706
You are right. They
met in the battlefield. .

1590
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:12,511
. . but still you can take him
your home as your son-in-law.

1591
02:14:12,582 --> 02:14:16,313
Pitamaha, am I that fortunate.

1592
02:14:17,587 --> 02:14:22,456
I need to pray lord to get
a son-in-law like Arjuna.

1593
02:14:23,126 --> 02:14:25,651
Friend, start praying
to get such a blessing.

1594
02:14:27,530 --> 02:14:30,966
Arjuna, your fee is matchless.

1595
02:14:31,334 --> 02:14:33,962
No disciple can give
better fee to his master, son.

1596
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:38,937
Master, I wonder what
fee my cousin Krishna. .

1597
02:14:39,008 --> 02:14:41,272
. . is about to give his master.

1598
02:14:50,153 --> 02:14:53,213
How is he who dared to call me. .

1599
02:14:53,289 --> 02:14:55,951
. .the God of death !

1600
02:14:56,225 --> 02:15:00,025
Who wants to get death-penalty!

1601
02:15:00,363 --> 02:15:03,628
Who is that arrogant fellow!

1602
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,592
Yamadharamraja( God of
death ), enough of it.

1603
02:15:05,701 --> 02:15:08,966
You are insulting the
lord who incarnated. .

1604
02:15:09,005 --> 02:15:11,030
. .for the prosperity of the world?

1605
02:15:11,107 --> 02:15:12,972
You can see my brother's greatness. .

1606
02:15:13,042 --> 02:15:14,441
. . if you open your eyes and see him.

1607
02:15:28,057 --> 02:15:30,525
Lord, what's the
reason behind your arrival.

1608
02:15:31,127 --> 02:15:35,063
Send my master's son back
with me whom you brought here.

1609
02:15:35,264 --> 02:15:44,297
''Lord, how is possible to send back
a human being who has already died. ''

1610
02:15:44,574 --> 02:15:50,069
''Is it possible for the rivers
to go back to. .

1611
02:15:50,146 --> 02:15:53,081
. .their origins after
meeting the ocean?''

1612
02:15:53,349 --> 02:16:00,619
''This is the law of nature. ''

1613
02:16:01,157 --> 02:16:11,158
''O lord, how shall
I break this law?''

1614
02:16:13,302 --> 02:16:20,037
''Dharma, death and lives
occur according to my wish. ''

1615
02:16:21,244 --> 02:16:26,443
''What I do is dharma ! ''

1616
02:16:28,317 --> 02:16:33,983
''To serve my master
on planet earth. . ''

1617
02:16:34,590 --> 02:16:39,254
''. .I have to save my master's son. ''

1618
02:16:39,462 --> 02:16:48,427
''Send back my master's son. ''

1619
02:16:57,013 --> 02:16:58,071
As you wish, lord.

1620
02:16:59,148 --> 02:17:00,945
Sandeep Kumara.

1621
02:17:06,088 --> 02:17:09,683
Sandeep Kumara, your
parents are waiting for you.

1622
02:17:10,293 --> 02:17:13,023
We shall go now. May I
take your leave now?

1623
02:17:24,273 --> 02:17:27,970
Master, here is your son.

1624
02:17:28,177 --> 02:17:30,304
Father.
- Son.

1625
02:17:30,913 --> 02:17:32,972
Father.
- Son.

1626
02:17:33,049 --> 02:17:35,449
Father.
- You are back, son. You are back.

1627
02:17:36,185 --> 02:17:41,179
Dear. Dear, our son is back.

1628
02:17:41,257 --> 02:17:43,122
Krishna and
Balarama brought him back.

1629
02:17:43,459 --> 02:17:44,517
Son.
- Mother.

1630
02:17:44,594 --> 02:17:45,652
Son.
- Mother.

1631
02:17:45,928 --> 02:17:47,395
Son. Son.

1632
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:56,937
Krishna. Balarama. I
wonder how we shall thank you. .

1633
02:17:56,973 --> 02:18:01,273
. .and how we will repay your debt.

1634
02:18:01,344 --> 02:18:06,213
Krishna. Balarama. I am
blessed to be your master.

1635
02:18:06,549 --> 02:18:10,280
May all your wishes come true. .

1636
02:18:10,620 --> 02:18:14,147
. .and may your name be
famous till eternity.

1637
02:18:14,423 --> 02:18:16,357
True. True.

1638
02:18:16,959 --> 02:18:18,017
How true it is.

1639
02:18:19,962 --> 02:18:21,361
This sight is a boon to eyes.

1640
02:18:21,497 --> 02:18:22,555
Today it's a festive day.

1641
02:18:23,099 --> 02:18:24,964
Human and God both
achieved great victories. .

1642
02:18:25,001 --> 02:18:26,969
. .on the same day, and
offered fee to their masters. .

1643
02:18:27,003 --> 02:18:28,561
. . in the same way.

1644
02:18:29,071 --> 02:18:31,096
Human being also
offered fee to his master?

1645
02:18:31,507 --> 02:18:33,304
Narada, what are you talking about?

1646
02:18:33,643 --> 02:18:34,974
Arjuna defeated and imprisoned. .

1647
02:18:35,044 --> 02:18:37,979
. .the might king
Dhrupada and made him touch. .

1648
02:18:38,047 --> 02:18:41,642
. . his master's feet
and beg for forgiveness.

1649
02:18:41,717 --> 02:18:42,979
What's the benefit in destroying. .

1650
02:18:43,052 --> 02:18:45,987
. .others' arrogance,
Narada ! One should be able to. .

1651
02:18:46,055 --> 02:18:49,513
. . kill the arrogance and
envy of the near and dear ones.

1652
02:18:50,059 --> 02:18:51,583
Near and dear ones?

1653
02:18:53,062 --> 02:18:54,996
Now I understood it.
Now I understood it.

1654
02:18:58,034 --> 02:19:00,628
. .and Gandhari's envy, right?
- Not just that. .

1655
02:19:01,203 --> 02:19:06,402
. . but if you offer prayers to lord,
it will make your life prosperous.

1656
02:19:06,609 --> 02:19:09,009
I understood it.
You are ordering me. .

1657
02:19:09,078 --> 02:19:15,210
. .to start a new chapter in this
act. I will fulfill your wish.

1658
02:19:16,085 --> 02:19:18,553
I shall go now. Hail lord Narayana !
Hail lord Narayana !

1659
02:19:20,690 --> 02:19:25,024
My sons cannot become as
famous as those Pandavas?

1660
02:19:25,361 --> 02:19:26,487
Do not worry, queen.

1661
02:19:26,696 --> 02:19:29,631
How can we expect more
fruits by putting less effort!

1662
02:19:30,232 --> 02:19:34,191
I am ready to put any
effort for my sons' welfare.

1663
02:19:35,071 --> 02:19:36,561
I am ready to perform any vow.

1664
02:19:37,273 --> 02:19:41,232
If someone tells me
which vow to perform. .

1665
02:19:41,310 --> 02:19:43,244
Hail lord Narayana ! Hail
lord Narayana ! - Who's that?

1666
02:19:43,512 --> 02:19:46,174
Saint Narayana ! Please be seated.

1667
02:19:48,517 --> 02:19:50,382
You came here on hearing my grief.

1668
02:19:50,986 --> 02:19:53,978
Saint, tell me which
vow I shall perform. .

1669
02:19:54,056 --> 02:19:56,183
. .for my son's fame and welfare.

1670
02:19:56,325 --> 02:19:59,453
There's a great
elephant called Iravatam.

1671
02:19:59,595 --> 02:20:03,998
The mother who worships that
elephant gets her sons' welfare.

1672
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:07,636
Iravatam vow? What's the
procedure of that vow?

1673
02:20:07,703 --> 02:20:11,070
This vow was started by
Mother Gauri in Kailasham.

1674
02:20:11,207 --> 02:20:13,732
That's why this vow is
also known as Gaja Gauri vow.

1675
02:20:14,410 --> 02:20:19,006
You need to get the Iravatam and roam
the entire province on that elephant.

1676
02:20:19,215 --> 02:20:21,012
. .and you have to give
the holy offerings. .

1677
02:20:21,083 --> 02:20:22,550
. .to hundred mothers who have sons.

1678
02:20:22,685 --> 02:20:24,414
How will Iravatam
come down to earth?

1679
02:20:24,687 --> 02:20:26,552
This vow seems to
be a difficult one.

1680
02:20:26,689 --> 02:20:29,021
If you want great fruits you
will have to take great efforts. .

1681
02:20:29,091 --> 02:20:30,718
. .for that. The saints and
ancestors knew that we humans. .

1682
02:20:31,227 --> 02:20:34,424
. . might face difficultly
in performing these vows. .

1683
02:20:34,497 --> 02:20:36,226
. .so they gave some concessions.

1684
02:20:36,632 --> 02:20:37,963
They said it every now and then. .

1685
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,969
. .that if we don't get
gold we can use silver. .

1686
02:20:41,003 --> 02:20:43,972
. . if we don't get silver,
we can use bronze. .

1687
02:20:44,006 --> 02:20:46,099
. . if we don't get bronze,
we can use mud.

1688
02:20:46,509 --> 02:20:49,967
If you can't get Iravatam,
then build him replica with mud. .

1689
02:20:50,045 --> 02:20:52,513
. .and worship it.
- What!

1690
02:20:53,582 --> 02:20:54,981
How can one make a mud-elephant. .

1691
02:20:55,050 --> 02:20:58,645
. .walk in the kingdom?
- You don't know that?

1692
02:20:59,054 --> 02:21:03,115
We can fix wheels to it.
- She is right.

1693
02:21:04,059 --> 02:21:05,993
I will get the elephant
build tomorrow itself.

1694
02:21:06,128 --> 02:21:09,393
You can't build it.
- You are right.

1695
02:21:09,532 --> 02:21:12,330
If uncle touches it the
elephant will become inauspicious.

1696
02:21:13,536 --> 02:21:16,004
That's not the thing,
dear. When you build. .

1697
02:21:16,038 --> 02:21:19,064
. .the mud-elephant, it
must be done by sons.

1698
02:21:19,208 --> 02:21:23,008
That's why they say that any
mother can perform this vow. .

1699
02:21:23,078 --> 02:21:25,672
. . if she has sons.
- Great.

1700
02:21:26,215 --> 02:21:30,208
So aunt Kunti can
also perform this vow.

1701
02:21:30,352 --> 02:21:31,683
Dushala, you stay quiet.

1702
02:21:32,555 --> 02:21:34,955
Saint, tell us an
auspicious moment. .

1703
02:21:35,024 --> 02:21:36,150
. .to build the mud-elephant.

1704
02:21:36,625 --> 02:21:39,560
The next Hasta-star
is an auspicious day.

1705
02:21:39,628 --> 02:21:42,688
Get the mud on that day
and build the elephant.

1706
02:21:43,966 --> 02:21:46,992
How difficult is that!
We are hundred brothers.

1707
02:21:47,169 --> 02:21:51,435
We will get the mud and
build the replica of Iravatam.

1708
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:54,973
May God bless you !
- Saint, you must stay here. .

1709
02:21:55,044 --> 02:21:58,639
. .and oversee this vow.
- I will be here.

1710
02:21:58,981 --> 02:22:01,711
But it's the Lord who
makes everything possible.

1711
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:03,576
Hail lord Narayana !
Hail lord Narayana !

1712
02:22:23,038 --> 02:22:25,734
''It's great, elder cousin. ''

1713
02:22:26,141 --> 02:22:28,473
''It's great, younger cousin. ''

1714
02:22:29,078 --> 02:22:31,478
''We never saw this miracle before. ''

1715
02:22:31,547 --> 02:22:34,539
''You are matchless. ''

1716
02:22:35,017 --> 02:22:37,611
''It's great, elder cousin. ''

1717
02:22:38,020 --> 02:22:40,614
''It's great, younger cousin. ''

1718
02:22:56,572 --> 02:22:59,302
''You are hundred brothers. ''

1719
02:22:59,375 --> 02:23:02,242
''You are thunders. ''

1720
02:23:04,313 --> 02:23:06,713
''You are hundred brothers. ''

1721
02:23:07,316 --> 02:23:09,716
''You are thunders. ''

1722
02:23:10,319 --> 02:23:12,719
''You brought the mud. . ''

1723
02:23:13,055 --> 02:23:16,047
''. .and built the elephant. ''

1724
02:23:24,133 --> 02:23:27,193
''. .and built the elephant. ''

1725
02:23:27,636 --> 02:23:33,336
''You are brave. You are courageous. ''

1726
02:23:33,609 --> 02:23:36,544
''It's great, elder cousin. ''

1727
02:23:36,612 --> 02:23:39,547
''It's great, younger cousin. ''

1728
02:23:52,027 --> 02:23:57,693
''Your mother expressed a
wish and you are fulfilling it. ''

1729
02:24:01,203 --> 02:24:03,967
''A mother can't ask for more. ''

1730
02:24:04,006 --> 02:24:06,975
''A mother can't ask for more. ''

1731
02:24:07,176 --> 02:24:12,978
''This is not a lie. But such people
won't be born again and again. ''

1732
02:24:13,315 --> 02:24:16,113
''It's great, elder cousin. ''

1733
02:24:16,251 --> 02:24:19,049
''It's great, younger cousin. ''

1734
02:24:31,166 --> 02:24:37,127
''There are drums, there are colors.
There are colorful umbrellas. ''

1735
02:24:43,345 --> 02:24:49,215
''There are drums, there are colors.
There are colorful umbrellas. ''

1736
02:24:49,485 --> 02:24:52,283
''The entire province is
filled with green leaves. ''

1737
02:24:52,354 --> 02:24:55,289
''I offer my salutations. ''

1738
02:25:01,230 --> 02:25:04,165
''The entire province is filled
with green leaves. ''

1739
02:25:04,199 --> 02:25:07,168
''I offer my salutations. ''

1740
02:25:07,302 --> 02:25:13,036
''It's a festive season all around.
Everyone is celebrating. ''

1741
02:25:13,375 --> 02:25:16,173
''It's great, elder cousin. ''

1742
02:25:16,311 --> 02:25:19,178
''It's great, younger cousin. ''

1743
02:25:19,515 --> 02:25:22,040
''We never saw this miracle before. ''

1744
02:25:22,117 --> 02:25:25,177
''You are matchless. ''

1745
02:25:38,167 --> 02:25:41,136
Mother, won't give you the
holy offering to aunt Kunti?

1746
02:25:41,236 --> 02:25:42,567
To that widow? No.

1747
02:25:43,038 --> 02:25:46,201
But I heard that it doesn't
matter if the lady is a widow. .

1748
02:25:46,475 --> 02:25:49,069
. .and that anyone who has sons
can accept this holy offering.

1749
02:25:49,144 --> 02:25:51,009
You don't know anything.

1750
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:52,411
Keep quiet.

1751
02:25:53,482 --> 02:25:56,474
Mother, why didn't they
stop it in front of our house?

1752
02:25:56,952 --> 02:25:58,613
Why didn't you get
the holy offering?

1753
02:25:58,954 --> 02:26:01,013
Radha, take the holy offering.

1754
02:26:01,290 --> 02:26:03,417
Mother, you are giving
me the holy offering?

1755
02:26:03,959 --> 02:26:08,555
Yes, Radha. You are
valiant Karna's son.

1756
02:26:08,964 --> 02:26:11,398
Take it.
- I accept it, queen.

1757
02:26:13,402 --> 02:26:16,963
Mother, aunt Gandhari has
given the holy offerings. .

1758
02:26:17,005 --> 02:26:21,374
. .to Karna's mother. Why did she
ignore you? - It's alright, son.

1759
02:26:21,643 --> 02:26:24,976
I can't tolerate it. We
must teach them a lesson.

1760
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:26,704
It took them 100
brothers to build that elephant.

1761
02:26:27,116 --> 02:26:29,710
I can build that
elephant single-handedly. - Son.

1762
02:26:30,052 --> 02:26:31,041
Bheema.

1763
02:26:39,928 --> 02:26:41,190
Hail grandfather Aryaka !

1764
02:27:20,969 --> 02:27:22,163
Brother Bheema !

1765
02:27:23,605 --> 02:27:26,165
Bheema. Bheema.
- Do not get scared.

1766
02:27:26,508 --> 02:27:29,966
I am throwing the
mud-pieces on the shore. Be careful.

1767
02:27:33,382 --> 02:27:35,441
What are you doing here! Go away.

1768
02:27:35,517 --> 02:27:38,247
We won't leave.
- Will you leave or not?

1769
02:27:53,168 --> 02:27:54,965
Uncle, eat this.

1770
02:27:57,306 --> 02:27:59,672
My hunger is
quenched a long ago, nephew.

1771
02:28:00,209 --> 02:28:04,009
Defaming Pandavas fills our stomach.

1772
02:28:04,146 --> 02:28:05,408
Have it.

1773
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:41,513
Mother, brother
Bheema has grown so big.

1774
02:28:41,583 --> 02:28:43,983
He is throwing the
mud-pieces and destroying everything.

1775
02:28:44,119 --> 02:28:47,316
Yes, mother. You must come.
- Let's go, son.

1776
02:28:53,195 --> 02:28:55,186
Bheema, you are
destroying everything.

1777
02:28:55,264 --> 02:28:57,129
Calm down, son. Calm down.

1778
02:29:04,172 --> 02:29:06,003
Son. Bheema.

1779
02:29:09,144 --> 02:29:11,009
Son, don't bring me the defame. .

1780
02:29:11,079 --> 02:29:14,276
. .that my son is
destroying the kingdom.

1781
02:29:14,549 --> 02:29:18,679
Mother, no. This is for your vow.

1782
02:29:19,021 --> 02:29:21,080
We brothers will
build the mud-elephant.

1783
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:25,420
Our mother will perform
the vow with a mud-elephant?

1784
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:27,687
We will bring the Iravatam.
Come down.

1785
02:29:28,230 --> 02:29:30,027
Is that possible?
- Yes, it is possible.

1786
02:29:30,365 --> 02:29:31,992
Nothing is
impossible for human being.

1787
02:29:32,167 --> 02:29:33,361
You come down first of all.

1788
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:36,969
Iravatam is in the heaven.
How will we get it?

1789
02:29:37,172 --> 02:29:40,972
It's not difficult. We will
send an epistle to lord Indra. .

1790
02:29:41,043 --> 02:29:44,035
. .to send Iravatam.
- I will send that epistle.

1791
02:29:44,112 --> 02:29:45,579
I will bring down Iravatam.

1792
02:29:46,181 --> 02:29:48,649
I will make mother perform
the vow. You come down first.

1793
02:29:48,984 --> 02:29:52,511
Come down, son.
- Hail grandfather Aryaka !

1794
02:30:04,633 --> 02:30:05,725
Where did this arrow come from?

1795
02:30:06,234 --> 02:30:10,000
It seems that that
arrow came from earth.

1796
02:30:11,473 --> 02:30:13,338
Master, please read it.

1797
02:30:17,412 --> 02:30:22,213
This is Arjuna's message
to the king of heaven.

1798
02:30:24,353 --> 02:30:28,016
My mother wished to
perform Iravatam's vow.

1799
02:30:28,090 --> 02:30:29,421
Kindly send your elephant.

1800
02:30:32,027 --> 02:30:34,962
I will send your another message. .

1801
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:37,021
. .after we receive Iravatam.

1802
02:30:38,567 --> 02:30:43,402
How can Devendra send his
elephant to planet earth !

1803
02:30:43,972 --> 02:30:46,566
How arrogant is he!

1804
02:30:47,175 --> 02:30:52,044
We must teach him a
lesson for this misdeed.

1805
02:30:52,514 --> 02:30:56,507
Dharmaraja, do not be upset.
You saw it just now.

1806
02:30:57,252 --> 02:30:59,982
No human being could
send a message to heaven. .

1807
02:31:00,055 --> 02:31:02,990
. .with his arrow.
Devendra, that human is none. .

1808
02:31:03,058 --> 02:31:05,390
. . but one of the
lord's incarnations.

1809
02:31:07,062 --> 02:31:08,120
He's a human being.

1810
02:31:09,197 --> 02:31:11,529
But still we have to
think about it, Indra.

1811
02:31:11,633 --> 02:31:13,999
Even if he's a
human being or a God. .

1812
02:31:14,035 --> 02:31:16,003
. . he won't get that elephant.

1813
02:31:16,204 --> 02:31:21,267
But do not forget
that Arjuna is your son.

1814
02:31:22,210 --> 02:31:24,201
I can't have any mercy on
him just because he is my son.

1815
02:31:24,679 --> 02:31:27,011
If he is that powerful
ask him to come here. .

1816
02:31:27,082 --> 02:31:29,607
. .and defeat it
and take it with him.

1817
02:31:30,152 --> 02:31:33,019
Master, send our message to him.

1818
02:31:51,506 --> 02:31:54,498
Lord Indra sent
his wishes to Arjuna.

1819
02:31:54,643 --> 02:31:56,975
Didn't he send Iravatam?
- He said that he would send. .

1820
02:31:57,045 --> 02:31:59,707
. .Iravatam if you
send your man to heaven.

1821
02:32:00,649 --> 02:32:02,446
Now it's up to you.

1822
02:32:04,653 --> 02:32:07,053
I will build a ladder to
heaven with my arrows.

1823
02:32:07,122 --> 02:32:10,182
And I will go to heaven
and bring Iravam here.

1824
02:32:10,325 --> 02:32:11,587
May your wish come true!

1825
02:32:56,972 --> 02:33:00,373
''The human being is magnificent. ''

1826
02:33:01,309 --> 02:33:04,437
''The human being is magnificent. ''

1827
02:33:05,580 --> 02:33:11,519
''He is strong. He is determination. ''

1828
02:33:12,187 --> 02:33:15,452
''The human being is magnificent. ''

1829
02:33:21,129 --> 02:33:25,327
''There is no stopping him if
he walks on the righteous path. ''

1830
02:33:27,402 --> 02:33:31,463
''A human can even make the
God come down to earth. ''

1831
02:33:33,942 --> 02:33:37,139
''The human being is magnificent. ''

1832
02:33:38,213 --> 02:33:41,205
''The human being is magnificent. ''

1833
02:34:00,168 --> 02:34:04,400
''Baghiratha who brought
Ganges to earth is a human being. ''

1834
02:34:06,508 --> 02:34:10,968
''Dhruva who turned into a
star is also a human being. ''

1835
02:34:13,114 --> 02:34:17,380
''Saint Vishwamitra is also a saint. ''

1836
02:34:19,454 --> 02:34:23,982
''All these achievers are humans. ''

1837
02:34:26,061 --> 02:34:29,189
''The human being is magnificent. ''

1838
02:34:30,265 --> 02:34:33,359
''The human being is magnificent. ''

1839
02:34:50,018 --> 02:34:54,421
''He crossed the
planets and the stars. ''

1840
02:34:58,560 --> 02:35:03,088
''He crossed the
planets and the stars. ''

1841
02:35:05,166 --> 02:35:12,163
''He reached the end of the sky. ''

1842
02:35:14,042 --> 02:35:18,240
''The Chandralok( world of moon-god)
and the Devendralok. . ''

1843
02:35:22,584 --> 02:35:26,987
''He can touch the
Chandralok and the Devendralok. . ''

1844
02:35:27,188 --> 02:35:31,386
''. .and come back to earth. ''

1845
02:35:31,459 --> 02:35:34,656
''The human being is magnificent. ''

1846
02:35:35,997 --> 02:35:41,629
''He is strong. He is determination. ''

1847
02:35:42,437 --> 02:35:45,463
''The human being is magnificent. ''

1848
02:35:46,608 --> 02:35:50,009
''The human being is magnificent. ''

1849
02:35:58,086 --> 02:36:00,953
Salutations the lord of heaven. .

1850
02:36:01,022 --> 02:36:05,015
. .from Pandavas and
Kunti's third son.

1851
02:36:05,627 --> 02:36:09,290
As per your wish my
brother sent me here.

1852
02:36:09,364 --> 02:36:11,161
Send Iravatam with me.

1853
02:36:11,499 --> 02:36:15,993
Son, Iravatam is very powerful.
Everyone can't tame it.

1854
02:36:16,571 --> 02:36:19,972
And you are just a kid. If you
have the strength to tame it. .

1855
02:36:20,041 --> 02:36:23,374
. .I do not have any objection.
What do you say?

1856
02:36:23,578 --> 02:36:25,375
I am pleased with your generosity.

1857
02:36:36,524 --> 02:36:40,119
Karma, Bheema must have
reached heaven by now.

1858
02:36:40,328 --> 02:36:41,920
You have to destroy the ladder. .

1859
02:36:41,996 --> 02:36:43,463
. .so that he could
never return to earth.

1860
02:36:43,531 --> 02:36:47,160
Burn that ladder
with one of your arrows.

1861
02:36:47,335 --> 02:36:49,929
It's not the right
thing to do on our part.

1862
02:36:49,971 --> 02:36:53,463
It's against dharma. - I don't
care if it's against dharma.

1863
02:36:53,541 --> 02:36:56,135
I accepted you as my best friend.

1864
02:36:57,078 --> 02:36:59,945
That day you made a
promise in front of everyone.

1865
02:37:00,014 --> 02:37:02,005
Will you go back on your word now?

1866
02:37:02,217 --> 02:37:03,946
Do not worry,
Suyodhana. Do not worry.

1867
02:37:04,018 --> 02:37:06,282
I will do anything that you ask for.

1868
02:37:06,488 --> 02:37:07,955
Even if the world says
that it's against dharma. .

1869
02:37:08,022 --> 02:37:10,286
. .I will bear that
disgrace for your sake.

1870
02:37:12,093 --> 02:37:15,085
Karna, that's what
true friendship is.

1871
02:37:16,030 --> 02:37:17,088
Do not wait further.

1872
02:37:30,979 --> 02:37:32,037
Shakuni.

1873
02:37:35,250 --> 02:37:38,651
You didn't quit your evilness yet.

1874
02:37:39,053 --> 02:37:42,648
You won't get forgiveness
after corrupting children's minds.

1875
02:37:43,925 --> 02:37:45,916
Karna, you dared to
commit such crimes. .

1876
02:37:45,994 --> 02:37:47,928
. .for the sake of friendship.
Is that why you won. .

1877
02:37:47,996 --> 02:37:51,124
. . Sun-god's heart and
learnt your skills from him?

1878
02:37:51,466 --> 02:37:54,026
This friendship might
lead to your destruction.

1879
02:37:55,436 --> 02:37:59,338
I must punish these evil
forces. Imprison them.

1880
02:38:03,278 --> 02:38:06,008
Dharmaja. Arjuna. Do not be scared.

1881
02:38:06,347 --> 02:38:08,008
Dharma always wins.

1882
02:38:08,483 --> 02:38:11,213
Our Bheema can come back to
earth with God's blessings.

1883
02:39:08,676 --> 02:39:13,272
Mother.
- Bheema. Bheema. Son.

1884
02:39:16,150 --> 02:39:17,549
Hail grandfather Aryaka !

1885
02:39:32,567 --> 02:39:35,365
Bheema. Bheema. Bheema.

1886
02:39:35,603 --> 02:39:38,163
I will send Iravatam with
you. Come down. Come down.

1887
02:39:38,506 --> 02:39:40,235
Hail grandfather Aryaka !

1888
02:39:48,316 --> 02:39:51,183
O great Bheema, I am pleased.

1889
02:39:51,519 --> 02:39:53,248
Your valor is matchless.

1890
02:39:53,521 --> 02:39:55,648
I will send Iravatam
with you today itself.

1891
02:39:56,190 --> 02:39:57,987
Your mother can
perform the Iravatam vow. .

1892
02:39:58,059 --> 02:39:59,526
. .without any hurdle. Iravatam.

1893
02:40:02,397 --> 02:40:03,989
Go to planet earth with Bheema. .

1894
02:40:04,032 --> 02:40:05,124
. .and help them perform the vow.

1895
02:40:07,035 --> 02:40:09,003
Narada, you are the
one who suggested them. .

1896
02:40:09,037 --> 02:40:10,732
. .to perform this vow. You
go there and oversee the vow.

1897
02:40:12,540 --> 02:40:15,737
Meghadoota, take
them to planet earth.

1898
02:40:17,078 --> 02:40:18,602
Hail lord Narayana !
Hail lord Narayana !

1899
02:41:06,527 --> 02:41:10,122
Hail Bheema ! Hail the Pandavas!

1900
02:41:10,198 --> 02:41:13,326
Hail Bheema ! Hail the Pandavas!

1901
02:41:14,235 --> 02:41:18,137
Hail Mother Kunti !
Hail the Pandavas!

1902
02:41:18,339 --> 02:41:21,740
Hail Mother Kunti !
Hail the Pandavas!

1903
02:41:22,143 --> 02:41:25,670
Hail Bheema ! Hail the Pandavas!

1904
02:41:30,952 --> 02:41:33,420
Suyodhana. Suyodhana.

1905
02:41:34,956 --> 02:41:36,150
Iravatam is here.

1906
02:41:36,224 --> 02:41:38,692
The vow is being
performed in a grand way.

1907
02:41:39,627 --> 02:41:44,587
A vow is being performed.
You too go with them. Go.

1908
02:41:47,368 --> 02:41:50,599
Hail Mother Kunti !
Hail the Pandavas!

1909
02:41:51,372 --> 02:41:53,636
Man proposes and god disposes.

1910
02:41:54,642 --> 02:41:57,975
I had so many
dreams to make my sons. .

1911
02:41:58,046 --> 02:42:00,241
. .greater than Kunti's son.

1912
02:42:02,250 --> 02:42:03,308
All my dreams have crashed.

1913
02:42:04,318 --> 02:42:09,187
Pandavas are succeeding
and my son faced disgrace.

1914
02:42:09,257 --> 02:42:14,194
And my envy is the
reason behind everything.

1915
02:42:14,395 --> 02:42:17,626
Hail Mother Kunti !
Hail the Pandavas!

1916
02:42:17,999 --> 02:42:20,593
Hail Mother Kunti !
Hail the Pandavas!

1917
02:42:21,602 --> 02:42:23,399
Is Kunti coming to our place?

1918
02:42:23,438 --> 02:42:27,204
No. Why would she come here!

1919
02:42:27,275 --> 02:42:30,711
She won't come here.

1920
02:42:31,279 --> 02:42:37,149
I insulted Kunti without
giving her the holy offering.

1921
02:42:38,152 --> 02:42:41,087
I don't deserve to get
the holy offering from her.

1922
02:42:42,623 --> 02:42:46,218
I must get punished.
- Mother. Mother.

1923
02:42:48,029 --> 02:42:50,497
Aunt came here to give
you the holy offering.

1924
02:42:51,966 --> 02:42:52,990
To me?

1925
02:42:54,402 --> 02:42:57,963
No, Dushala. I am
not that fortunate.

1926
02:42:58,306 --> 02:42:59,364
What are you saying, sister!

1927
02:43:00,241 --> 02:43:02,709
With you blessings I decided
to perform the Iravatam vow.

1928
02:43:03,578 --> 02:43:07,173
Whom else will I give the holy
offering, sister? Please accept it.

1929
02:43:08,049 --> 02:43:11,177
The holy offering? You brought
it for me? - Yes, it's for you.

1930
02:43:11,252 --> 02:43:13,049
Accept it, queen Gandhari.

1931
02:43:13,121 --> 02:43:15,248
Who is that? Is it saint Naradha?

1932
02:43:16,057 --> 02:43:20,517
Are you helping her
perform the vow? - Yes, queen.

1933
02:43:21,195 --> 02:43:24,995
I told you that day
itself that it's the Lord. .

1934
02:43:25,032 --> 02:43:26,192
. .who makes everything possible.

1935
02:43:26,234 --> 02:43:30,432
He just made me a messenger and
helped your sister perform the vow.

1936
02:43:30,938 --> 02:43:35,602
You are right. How can I
get the great saint's help. .

1937
02:43:37,011 --> 02:43:39,275
. .after bringing a
mud-elephant for the vow!

1938
02:43:41,616 --> 02:43:45,677
Sister Kunti, you are
really very fortunate.

1939
02:43:47,421 --> 02:43:49,218
You gave birth to great sons.

1940
02:43:50,224 --> 02:43:52,954
With their help you
are performing the vow. .

1941
02:43:53,027 --> 02:43:55,154
. .and getting fame
and goodwill for them.

1942
02:43:55,496 --> 02:43:58,192
We too have sons. We have 100 sons.

1943
02:43:58,499 --> 02:44:00,160
But they are of no use.

1944
02:44:00,301 --> 02:44:06,968
Parents'
responsibilities are not over. .

1945
02:44:07,041 --> 02:44:11,034
. .just after giving birth to kids.

1946
02:44:11,512 --> 02:44:13,377
You must also show
them the right path.

1947
02:44:14,515 --> 02:44:16,380
Only then will you get sweet fruits.

1948
02:44:17,185 --> 02:44:20,985
You can follow Kunti for that.
- You are right.

1949
02:44:21,989 --> 02:44:24,981
I got jealous and greedy.
I wanted my son. .

1950
02:44:25,059 --> 02:44:28,517
. .to become the king and
turned into an immoral person.

1951
02:44:29,330 --> 02:44:31,457
Father-in-law, forgive me.

1952
02:44:32,533 --> 02:44:33,932
At least from now
onwards I will try to lead. .

1953
02:44:33,968 --> 02:44:36,436
. .a life without
committing any mistakes.

1954
02:44:36,571 --> 02:44:37,663
Give me the holy offering, sister.

1955
02:44:43,077 --> 02:44:45,944
Sister, may your sons get
all the fame and happiness. .

1956
02:44:46,013 --> 02:44:49,141
. . in the world and you
may lead a peaceful life.

1957
02:44:49,617 --> 02:44:50,675
I am blessed.

1958
02:44:52,220 --> 02:44:55,485
Dharmaja, come here and
take your aunt's blessings.

1959
02:44:57,491 --> 02:44:59,959
Aunt, I am offering
you my salutations. .

1960
02:45:00,027 --> 02:45:04,964
. .along with my brother.
- God bless you. God bless you.

1961
02:45:05,967 --> 02:45:08,060
Dharmaja.
- Yes, aunt.

1962
02:45:10,571 --> 02:45:13,369
You are the most suitable
person for the king's throne.

1963
02:45:13,641 --> 02:45:16,041
You will definitely get
the crown sooner or later.

1964
02:45:17,178 --> 02:45:18,236
May that wish come true.

1965
02:45:19,981 --> 02:45:21,312
I am so fortunate.

1966
02:45:21,382 --> 02:45:25,250
Grandfather, I have a
small request on this occasion.

1967
02:45:25,519 --> 02:45:28,977
Why don't you
release brother Suyodhana. .

1968
02:45:29,056 --> 02:45:30,455
. .and uncle Shakuni from the prison?

1969
02:45:32,059 --> 02:45:35,460
Definitely. Definitely.
- Hail lord Narayana !

1970
02:45:47,541 --> 02:45:49,338
Krishna, it's all
because of your blessings.
