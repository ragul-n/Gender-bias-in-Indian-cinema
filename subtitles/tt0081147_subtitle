1
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:30,920
Sorry

2
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:40,101
I said, I'm sorry.
- Being sorry won't change facts

3
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,773
Then you tell me what I should do.
- Can anything be done anymore?

4
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,774
Thas my point, what can I do?
- Shame on you, Sanjay

5
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:58,649
You'll never know a girl's mind.
- But I can try. One more chance...?

6
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,759
Don't even talk to me

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,968
Will you say something?
- You just said don't talk to me.

8
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,810
Whas my problem?
- You're no good at relationships.

9
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,056
I'm sorry, Ria.
- What use being sorry now?

10
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,700
I'm really very sad.

11
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,366
I loved her so much.

12
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,373
And she dumped me, just like that?

13
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,045
It didn't take her even 20 minutes...
to get over a 20 day affair.

14
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,479
Broke my heart.

15
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,553
Sonia, you've hurt me.

16
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,556
My hears broken.

17
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:19,396
For the 8th time, Mr Sanjay Malhotra
in the last 11 months

18
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,071
Now get up and get it over with

19
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,745
Ria... listen to me

20
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,986
But one point. Over the last 11 months
8 girls broke my heart...

21
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,993
but only after I won their hearts, no?

22
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,826
Follow your heart, you can change the
world. 8 girls, 9th can't be too far

23
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,334
Thas Sanjay and Ria.
But this isn't their story

24
00:02:54,274 --> 00:03:00,770
This is Sanjay's and Anjali's story.
Sanju and Anju, who became friends...

25
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:05,446
long before they knew what friendship
meant. All they knew was...

26
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,280
they couldn't live
without each other

27
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,047
One minute, whas wrong?
Was touching her a crime?

28
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,414
You want what I want

29
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:30,291
Tell me, is thrilling, isn't it?
- Not another word

30
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:37,461
At my touch she becomes unworthy
of you? You care so much? Whas she?

31
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:42,803
Your fief, private property, what?
- Friend

32
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,779
Friends! Hear that? Can a boy and
a girl ever be friends?

33
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,808
See for yourself, thas an example
of friendship

34
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,386
What a pretense

35
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:57,979
Prem...

36
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:05,329
A boy and a girl can never be friends.
Actually is a...

37
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:10,998
You forgot the lines! I win the bet.
So you get to do the cooking

38
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,169
I didn't lose.
- No...?

39
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:21,675
I was thinking...
- Thinking? What?

40
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,342
This is a film, right?
With films, is different

41
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,179
But in real life, can a boy and
a girl be friends?

42
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,928
When a boy and a girl are friends
they either fall in love...

43
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,259
or else, they part ways

44
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:42,933
In any eventuality,
the friendship is terminated

45
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,599
Of course there can be a friendship
between boy and girl.

46
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,270
Look at us

47
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,908
You are a girl, I'm a boy. Between us
there's none of your so-called "love"

48
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,046
Our story is different.
We did go around for a week

49
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:01,143
But I knew on day three that
nothing could be more foolish...

50
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,385
than falling for you.
You get that?

51
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,217
Don't you forget, Ria Chowdhury was
the first girl who ditched you

52
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:12,897
Thank you for saving me!
As if she's some beauty queen

53
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,800
If you may spare some time off your
busy schedule, then is for you

54
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,304
Anju's...?

55
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,977
How was your trip? Was America fun?
How are your parents?

56
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,231
America was fun!
Mummy-Daddy enjoyed themselves

57
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:57,234
I returned 3 weeks ago.
- And you're calling me now?

58
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:04,347
I hope you didn't forget my list?
- Yes, I picked up everything

59
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,678
But hear me out first.
This is very important

60
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,715
Sanju...
- Yes tell me

61
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,094
I'm getting married, Sanju

62
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,434
The wedding is next month.
Everyone is coming

63
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,099
You got to be there too.
Come over, quick

64
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:35,780
You're... getting married?
- You never get anything fast, do you?

65
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,446
Now don't waste time, just pack and
take the first flight to Delhi

66
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:45,853
If you aren't here by tomorrow evening
...Sanju, are you listening?

67
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,190
Not just you. Everyone's surprised.
Everything happened so soon...

68
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,867
Just come over, I'll tell
you everything

69
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:06,978
I'm a bit busy for a few days.
Say hi, to Anu and your parents

70
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,526
I can't believe it...
she's getting married?

71
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,227
Who's upto what?

72
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,226
- Anju... Anjali is getting married

73
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:37,906
Wonderful news, no? - Yes, I'm glad,
very happy, thrilled

74
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,081
You don't seem so.
- What rubbish

75
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,954
I'm glad, very happy, thrilled!
Is only a bit sudden

76
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,281
Anjali, your childhood friend?
- Childhood? Ever since...

77
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:01,324
she was four and I was five.

78
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,993
And we were always together

79
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,671
School, college...
we were like buddies

80
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:16,678
How silly of Anjali...
- Anjali... has a lovely smile?

81
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:22,677
Thinking her smiling makes me smile.
- And your cheese omelettes?

82
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,512
Is Anjali who makes the real
cheese omelettes.

83
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,015
In comparison, I'm sordid

84
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:36,100
But how come you...? How come you
know all this about Anjali?

85
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,263
I know only bits and pieces.

86
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,267
But I'd like to know more.
Want to tell me?

87
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,109
What do you want to know?
- About your friendship

88
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,506
About your Anju.

89
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,048
About Anju!

90
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:56,947
How do I tell you...?

91
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:03,619
How do I introduce her?

92
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,235
"Here's a girl"

93
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,733
"What can I tell you about her?"

94
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,906
"She's crazy"

95
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,977
"She's different"

96
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,014
"Every moment..."
"there's something new about her"

97
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:11,262
"They shower flowers upon her path
and heads turn, wherever she goes"

98
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,522
"Oh what can I tell you about her?"

99
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,892
Tell me more about her

100
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,065
"She'll throw a tantrum"

101
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:30,568
"But then she comes around..."
"with a smile"

102
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,580
"She'll be quiet, without a word"

103
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,747
"And then she'll start humming..."

104
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:45,819
"a sweet song"

105
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:54,665
"How do I describe her?"

106
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:59,495
"She's only like herself'

107
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:05,267
"They shower flowers upon her path and
heads turn, wherever she goes"

108
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,613
"What can I tell you about her?"

109
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,451
You miss her?

110
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,549
"Every moment..."

111
00:14:55,394 --> 00:15:03,733
"I spent with her"
"I dream of, I don't know why..."

112
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:13,574
"Memories..."
"of that parting"

113
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:19,249
"hurt me,
I don't know why..."

114
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,984
"Now we have parted"

115
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,997
"But I pray for you,
my friend"

116
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,495
"May you find flowers upon your path
and make heads turn, wherever you go"

117
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,679
"Oh what can I tell you about her?"

118
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,690
Stop pacing and say something.

119
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,368
- I'm wondering... whether I ought
to tell you.

120
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,369
- Why not?

121
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,696
You can't take the truth.

122
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,875
Come on, out with it...
whatever this truth is.

123
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,373
- And you will hear me out?

124
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,713
I will, most patiently. I won't scream,
I won't say "what rubbish"

125
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:34,083
The truth is, you are in love
with Anjali

126
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,460
I know you think, I'm talking rubbish.

127
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,129
Because you don't realise...
you're in love with Anjali.

128
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,131
From Dehradun to Bombay...
you didn't take this trip alone.

129
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,304
Anjali came too, hidden in your heart

130
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,811
And in every girl you met afterwards,
you tried to find Anjali

131
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,783
Sonia. Her tresses reminded
you of Anjali

132
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:06,318
Megha. Her cheese omelettes
were passable

133
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,822
One Ria too. Her smile was
somewhat like Anjali's

134
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:16,000
But not Anjali. And how could
you find another? Anjali is unique

135
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:25,004
Every girl who looked into your eyes
found, not to herself, but someone else.

136
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,009
That was Anjali.

137
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,007
Do you read, Mr Sanjay Stupid Malhotra?

138
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,509
The absolute truth about your life

139
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,347
Absurd

140
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,918
See...? I didn't crack up, never said,

141
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,586
"what rubbish", never even got angry

142
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,958
In spite of the fact that I never
heard such a stupid theory

143
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,695
I said it in the beginning,
you can't take the truth

144
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,026
You are getting irritated.

145
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,270
- Anjali and I...
how did you imagine?

146
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,268
Given brains, you'd imagine too.

147
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,940
- What rubbish

148
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,768
Anjali and I are friends, period.
- No point talking to you

149
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,377
Listen to me

150
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,541
Not a word.
- I don't want to talk to you, either

151
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,292
No one cares to listen

152
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,257
You were right

153
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:15,178
We men are very selfish.
- If you insist, I'll accept

154
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,753
No, is true.
Men are dogs

155
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,766
And our convictions
are so convenient

156
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,433
I too concluded so conveniently
that Anjali is mine

157
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:43,108
I mean, she'll always be
where she is...

158
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:50,519
waiting for me to marry her
when is convenient for me

159
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,524
I never considered she's human.

160
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,189
That she has her desires, her dreams

161
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:08,029
But what if I'm not part
of her dreams?

162
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:15,208
Never imagined, someone else
could come into her life

163
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:24,381
And how would Anjali possibly know
something I never told myself?

164
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,356
But then, how could I have
told her?

165
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,127
Only today I have come to know
how dearly I love her

166
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:38,960
Today...

167
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,302
when she is about to marry
someone else

168
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:52,713
I can understand, Sanjay. Some things
can be comprehended only out of loss

169
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,545
So what will you do now?

170
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,458
The 8:40 flight

171
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,832
You're... going... to Dehradun?

172
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,345
I know you're going to be hurt
to see this wedding happen

173
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:29,177
Anjali is about to marry someone else
and yet, you're...?

174
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,894
Ria, you don't understand.
Yes, I'm going

175
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,929
But not to attend the wedding,
I'm going to break it up

176
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:51,599
Anjali is only about to marry someone
else, she hasn't done it yet

177
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,442
She'll marry only me

178
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,279
Because, if you follow your heart...

179
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,552
- You can change the world?

180
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:36,145
"May joys abound"

181
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:42,055
"May health abound"

182
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:47,393
"May goodwill abound"

183
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:54,738
"May sorrow be dispelled"

184
00:22:56,007 --> 00:23:07,509
"May peace abound"

185
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,419
Peace? How am I to keep my peace?

186
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:16,392
Please, don't be cross.
Anjali is like a daughter to you

187
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:22,093
Thas exactly why, Vishnu!
This I shall grudge you forever

188
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,929
I am her uncle. And you finalised
her wedding without consulting me?

189
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,599
Goodness!
- You're creating a problem for nothing

190
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:35,609
Now I am "for nothing"!
You be my judge, who's the elder?

191
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,441
You are my elder.
- And I'm older than you are

192
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,280
I have finalised this match.
- Look, mother...

193
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,987
Now whas your problem?
- You're always butting-in

194
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,780
Shut up and touch the sacred fires.

195
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,792
Then embrace your brother

196
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,692
Come on brother, -You'll take
a thrashing someday

197
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:59,868
My husband is a little scared of you.
But my brother-in-law too?

198
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,134
No, his wife scares him worse

199
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:08,475
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Pull down the wall, I say

200
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,140
Ma, if the door isn't facing east...

201
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:17,855
- Mother-in-law, you'll pull down walls?
Just for the wedding?

202
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,224
- My dear anglicised son-in-law...

203
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,724
I'd rather tear down walls than
defy the scriptures

204
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,397
Bridegrooms never enter from the west!
Good God! This is sacrilege

205
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:33,229
So what Kappo? Lord Rama entered
from the west when he went to wed

206
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,736
How come?
- Ayodhya is west of Mithila

207
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:41,239
How could you forget that?
- How could you forget dear brother?

208
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,080
Lord Rama was exiled for 14 years.
Had he observed the scriptures...

209
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,750
Lord Rama woulïve been happy, no?

210
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,080
- Can you match that?

211
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:54,456
Our sister-in-law is matchless!

212
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,487
- Convinced him, at long last

213
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:02,756
I wonder if I coulïve convinced him
to get married

214
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,771
Anju's wedding is going to be fun!

215
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,105
- This sister-in-law of mine...
happens to be everyone's favourite!

216
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,607
And our wedding was no less grand

217
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:18,949
Yes, but there's no sign of the one
who regaled everyone at your wedding

218
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,114
Who...?
- Sanju

219
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,072
Bahadur Singh, are the gates washed?
- Yes

220
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,538
Plant the new saplings

221
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,041
You said the prayers without
waiting for me?

222
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,548
Sorry "girlfriend", I'm late.
- Not too late

223
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,556
There's much you can do.
- Thas why, I've come

224
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,058
Hello Uncle!
- There you are

225
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,399
All set?
- All upset

226
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,232
The engagement is next Sunday.
And everyone is in an uproar

227
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:17,573
I'm going to the office.

228
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:18,900
You've got to take care of everything.

229
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,405
Has everyone arrived?
- Everyone.

230
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,909
Uncle, aunt...?
- Both

231
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:27,743
I better time my entry.
- Rascal! Go in, I'll join you

232
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,153
Take in Sanjay's luggage

233
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,822
I'll be back in two hours.
- No, please...

234
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,926
Hey girl...
I'll pull your hair

235
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:38,991
Stay back

236
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:47,496
First, have you found someone who can
straighten you out? A nice girl, like me?

237
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:52,536
Now... what can I say
- You married him and broke my heart

238
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:58,172
Somehow, I found someone.
Now I hear she's getting married too

239
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:04,986
Nice girl?
- Nice? Mind-blowing

240
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,484
More mind-blowing than me?
- You're unsurpassable

241
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,694
She's somewhat like you.

242
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,697
Could be a little sister to you?

243
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,695
Oh, but what good is all that now?

244
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,366
That boy is incorrigible

245
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:30,877
My obeisances to the Aunt.
- Bless you

246
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,216
Aren't you a bit too early for a
post-wedding appearance?

247
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:38,253
I would have come earlier were it not
for a black cat that crossed my path

248
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:44,293
Goodness! And then?
- I took a round trip to get here

249
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,120
Thas the right thing to do.
- Forget all that

250
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,793
Have you met Anju?
- I'll be seeing her

251
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,195
Look her up, before I leave...
I mean, I got to be going out

252
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,807
How's the business?
How is Wall Street treating you?

253
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,409
Anjali is upstairs.
- Upstairs... Anjali

254
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,072
Yes, go on

255
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:05,914
Sanju Uncle! -

256
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,282
Hi! Kutkut, You recognised me?

257
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:13,318
Yes and Grandpa wants to see you.
- Good Lord!

258
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,486
Obeisances, Uncle.
- Keep the obeisances for later

259
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,492
First, out there in Bombay
have you married secretly?

260
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:24,166
Good Lord!
- Good Lord! Without your approval...

261
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:28,668
Can I ever marry?
- Look at him, how understanding

262
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:34,673
What a good boy! And take our Anjali
...have you met her?

263
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,841
Sanju! You haven't met Anjali yet?
- No Nilu-didi

264
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,176
But why is everyone all
agog about Anjali?

265
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:45,755
Sanju, whas this I hear?
- Hello Grannie

266
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,549
Bless you. Haven't you seen Anju yet?

267
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,384
- I will, I will, please sit down

268
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,924
Whas the hurry?
- But of course...

269
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,424
Sanju! Here you are...
Anjali is waiting for you

270
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,768
Where...?
- Upstairs. Now come on

271
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,434
Let me say hi to the others.
- Later. Now come along

272
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:08,378
Oh come on, we've been expecting you
for ages. I mean, Anjali is waiting

273
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,375
Waiting for me... why?
- Would I know?

274
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,541
Is between you and your Anjali.

275
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,376
Go, she's waiting. Excuse me

276
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,134
Now he's floored

277
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,306
Today, little Anju, you've had it

278
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:51,785
Getting smart with Sanju?

279
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,587
You aren't giving me the slip.
- Come on

280
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,901
Let me see how can you
escape from me

281
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:39,300
Nice couple, no?
- Yes.

282
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:45,501
- Coulïve been better
Coulïve been you

283
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,012
Thas what I always thought.

284
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:59,753
- Whatever we think... marriages
are made in Heaven

285
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:11,466
Coulïve been different.
Nilu coulïve been my Aunt Nilu

286
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:18,708
"If you're in love,
why is the heart afraid of love?"

287
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,549
Hello, how are you?
- Hello Mr Khanna

288
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,877
Weren't you supposed to come yesterday?
- If you wish, I'll leave

289
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,089
You see, I just couldn't stay away.

290
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,725
Went to Delhi for few days
But couldn't stay there.

291
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,789
Where's our girl? Where's Anjali?

292
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,131
I'm here.
- There she is

293
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,135
Samosas. For you.
- Bless you

294
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,800
No. First, what did you
get from Delhi?

295
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,803
- Blackmailing me? Wait...

296
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:59,140
till you're married. Then I'll make you
cook hot samosas for me every day

297
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,909
I could cook for you. But your son, the
doctor, will he let you eat fries?

298
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,081
Between you and I and samosas
how did that fool crop up?

299
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:13,654
When is Rohit coming?

300
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,324
Sanjay, come over here

301
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:22,835
Sanjay. He's Mr. Malhotra's son.
- The late Mr. Malhotra...?

302
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,002
The one whose house I bought?
- Yes

303
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,339
So you are Sanjay!

304
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,844
Though we've never met,
I know your entire history

305
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,843
Anju speaks so much about you.
Whenever she's at our place...

306
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:40,180
she starts reeling off, here's Sanju's
room, this is where we played carrom...

307
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:45,394
so on and so forth.
Do come over some day

308
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,928
Is your house.
- Was. Now is yours

309
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,427
Anjali still calls it
Sanju's house

310
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,602
Silly, doesn't even realise
where she's going

311
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,715
After Mr. Malhotra died in the accident,
he moved to Bombay. Settled down well

312
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:16,291
Destiny is strange. Motherless boy,
at 20, he lost his father too

313
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,793
But he didn't break down

314
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,791
I like that boy

315
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,304
This is still here?

316
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,131
- Last year...

317
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:33,809
there was talk of cutting down this
branch. For 3 days, I cried

318
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:37,475
I went on hunger strike for 2 days
and at last, Papa relented

319
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,312
Why not let him cut it if he wants?

320
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,644
- How could I...? You made this swing

321
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:50,889
For hours we sat on this swing
as we plotted our mischief

322
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,726
Come, sit.
- I hope it doesn't break

323
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,899
If it hasn't broken in all these years
how can it break now? Come

324
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:07,002
You see? An old relationship
never lets you down

325
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,474
Go on, shoot.
- What...?

326
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:18,845
I know whas your tricky head
is full of

327
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,559
Full of what?
- Questions, countless questions

328
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:28,263
About him.
- About whom?

329
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:34,437
About Rohit, stupid. Who else?
Everyone is asking about him

330
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,098
But I haven't told anyone anything

331
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,276
Because I wanted you
to be the first to know

332
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,140
Rohit... where do I begin?

333
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,889
Last year... Rohis father came
to live in your house.

334
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,050
Papa told you, no?

335
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,652
Rohit has never come here.

336
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,256
Lives in America. He's a doctor

337
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,125
His father is a very nice person.

338
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,732
He started socialising with us

339
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,542
His house was always like a second home
to me, ever since your times

340
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,540
Everyone was worried about my trip
to America.

341
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:24,351
Rohit was out there. Uncle Khanna
assured us, there's no reason for worry.

342
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,315
That assured Papa

343
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,125
But I was so apprehensive.

344
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,586
Remember, I called you from the airport?

345
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,433
The prospect of travelling to America
all alone was so daunting

346
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,062
You were the one who gave me courage.

347
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:49,143
Were it not for your encouragement...
I might never have met Rohit

348
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,976
Takes a fool to shoot himself
in the leg

349
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,647
and I stepped right into the gun?

350
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:08,796
That a few days with Rohit would lead
us into this, I never expected

351
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,460
We hadn't quite met each other,

352
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,331
hardly had we got to know each other...

353
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,173
when his father made the proposal.

354
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:23,003
Papa asked me and I said yes

355
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:28,084
And look, we're getting ready
for the wedding

356
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:33,257
Sanju I need you to encourage me
once again.

357
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,159
I'm so nervous

358
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,027
Getting married for the
first time, you see

359
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,259
But now you're here and I know.

360
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,598
Everything is going to be fine

361
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,372
Mine is going to be
one memorable wedding

362
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,442
Anjali, over here...

363
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:53,869
- Coming, Didi (Didi: Sister)

364
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:09,415
One memorable wedding, for sure.

365
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,696
You won't forget it. Nor your Rohit

366
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,744
Your paan.
- Paan? Thanks

367
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:29,501
I've had a word with the priest.

368
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,271
The kulfi supplier is confirmed. 5,500

369
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,911
Bagged the queen already?

370
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,288
- He still needs a cover for score

371
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,891
Here you go

372
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,688
Uncle, bad luck! Lost your queen

373
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:53,496
For him, nothing new.
- What do you mean?

374
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:55,863
Means nothing.

375
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,839
Just put your heart into the game.
Winning, losing... makes no difference.

376
00:37:58,976 --> 00:37:59,465
Right?

377
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:00,873
Now whas on your mind?

378
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,443
Rohit.
- What about Rohit?

379
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:07,707
Unlike you, I know nothing about him.

380
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,612
- Know what? He's a doctor

381
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,586
Where?
- In America

382
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:12,719
Where in America?

383
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,782
You got an address?
A telephone number? Something?

384
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,287
Anjali would know.

385
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,893
- Is that all you care for her?

386
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,796
About the two of you, he wanted
to satisfy himself fully

387
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,030
While you were waiting for approvals.

388
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,639
He was investigating you thoroughly

389
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,940
Before the wedding was finalised,
he had every detail about you

390
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:44,948
Your photo was vetted even by the
farthest-flung relative

391
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,291
Naturally, is a brother's duty to vet
his sister's prospective suitors

392
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,123
And how have you investigated Rohit?

393
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,560
- You don't even have his numbers

394
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,299
Sanju, think before you speak.

395
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,630
- Sorry, I said what I felt right

396
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:05,902
Strange, no?

397
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,074
Here's a wedding in the offing and

398
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,610
no one has even seen the boy's photo?

399
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,440
Well, modern times

400
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,612
Look, nothing's wrong

401
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,349
He belongs to a nice family.

402
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,249
- And we were from bad ones?

403
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:25,460
No, I mean, his parents are nice.
- And our parents were bad?

404
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,332
Photo! Must-see!
- You must show us a photo

405
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:35,936
Quiet, I'm telling you.

406
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,767
- Why are the kids after you, Anjali?

407
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,809
She won't show us his photo.
- Whose photo?

408
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,378
Her fiance's.
- I don't have any photos

409
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,980
Yes, she has his photo.

410
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,680
- Uncle, will you scold them?

411
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,544
Kids, stop harassing her
and get lost

412
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,384
Come on, sit beside me

413
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,423
Come on, show it to me.
- What?

414
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,023
Your fiance's photo

415
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,428
Go on, let him see the photo.

416
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,600
In my time, I went to town...
with your grandfather's photo.

417
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,171
I showed him off to everyone...
the barber, the tailor, the confectioner

418
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,512
You can see Rohit when he comes.
Day after tomorrow

419
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,853
Upto you if you want to wait
till day after

420
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:27,851
But the eager will come to
Sanju, the magic man

421
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:32,853
The bridegroom's photo.

422
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,360
- How did he get his hands on it?

423
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,528
Rohis photo?

424
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,193
- Where did you find it?

425
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,530
I know every inch of your room

426
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:48,205
Sanju... don't you dare...

427
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,161
"I just heard..."
"you've chosen a mate for life"

428
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,598
"Now that you've made your choice..."

429
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,066
"tell us what is he like?"

430
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:06,651
"He's incomparable"
"He's smart and he's straight"

431
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:10,324
"And everyone thinks he's nice"

432
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:16,695
"He never lies"
"He never poisons minds"

433
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:20,767
"At heart, he's clean and honest"

434
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,296
"Understand, kid?"

435
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,813
"Tell me, or can't you?"
"Whas his species?"

436
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:09,581
"Unlike you, he isn't trash"
"He belongs to the new age"

437
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:31,670
"Did you take pity on him?"
- "Did he come crying to you?"

438
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:35,434
"Tell me, trust me"

439
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,513
"I know what you're getting at"
- "I warned her"

440
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,721
"Got to investigate boys, you know"

441
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,987
- "Be quiet"

442
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,759
"We just heard..."

443
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,258
"you've chosen a mate for life"

444
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,657
"But why did you have to make
such a choice?"

445
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,263
"What a choice"

446
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:36,365
"Does he keep mum? Is he a chatterbox?
How boring is he?"

447
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:41,571
"Wherever he is, he makes
such sparkling conversation"

448
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,993
"Is he Indian? Is he British?
- Is he an oaf? Is he witty?"

449
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:08,329
"Is he brave, like me?"

450
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,002
"Is he useless?"
- "How good will he be as a husband?"

451
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:18,271
"Just make sure he isn't like him"

452
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,412
"Surely not that type"

453
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,010
"We just heard..."

454
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,514
"you've chosen a mate for life"

455
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,949
"Well, now that you've made
your choice..."

456
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,588
"will you tell us what he's like?"

457
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:35,422
"Whatever you heard,
is absolutely correct"

458
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:40,432
"I have chosen my mate, but why should
I tell you about him?"

459
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:04,853
Can I take a walk?

460
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,128
- Whose wedding is it?

461
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,455
Who's arriving? Rohit!

462
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,529
- Then Rohit ges red carpet

463
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,961
Move it... not on that.
Get lost

464
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:00,081
One minute

465
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:08,723
Strange! No obeisances?
- Good Lord!

466
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,995
Bless you.

467
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,765
- Before anyone else...
I wanted to pay my respects to you.

468
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:22,934
Bless me...

469
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,774
that I may imbibe at least in part...

470
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,277
the ethics and the morality that
you have taught everyone

471
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,277
May such come to be

472
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,550
Obeisances, Uncle.
- May you live long

473
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:45,327
On my way, I carried oblations from
the temple of the Mother Goddess

474
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:51,298
Aunt, this book is for you.
Feng shui

475
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,436
Whas that?

476
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:56,697
- Ancient scriptures from China

477
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,874
Scriptures!
- Your favourite, no?

478
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,867
Wonderful! May you live long

479
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,513
Were I a son in this house
instead of a son-in-law...

480
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,654
you'd surely expect that before
I pay my respects to you...

481
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,891
I must obeisances to grandmother
and then to uncle and aunt

482
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:22,727
Thas why...

483
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:30,739
I hope I wasn't wrong.
- Oh no

484
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:34,409
Bless you

485
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:40,744
Bless you, son

486
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,145
Welcome Mr. Khanna

487
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,304
Will you never enter the sea?
Will you only watch from ashore?

488
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,844
Why drown yourself to learn what
someone else's mistakes can teach you?

489
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,260
You... must be Sanjay?

490
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,703
Guy Number Two who's close to Anjali.

491
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:39,374
- Number One

492
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,539
Number Two, is you

493
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,806
Just like Anjali described you.

494
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:50,948
Where's my Anjali?

495
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:07,135
Lord...

496
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:10,899
now I'm here

497
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,703
Let not this silly girl
pester You any longer

498
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,577
She can ask me for anything
she wants

499
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:22,249
Rohit, what are you doing here?
- Like you, praying

500
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:29,121
This is unbecoming of you

501
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:35,897
I asked your grandmother's permission.

502
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:37,800
- What have you done?

503
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:39,566
I've fallen in love with you

504
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,801
Now what do you want?
- I've travelled far

505
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:49,671
I ought to be rewarded

506
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,916
As of now, you're in a temple.

507
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,191
Oblations, is all you'll get here

508
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:04,091
Period

509
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:12,593
I'm making do, Lord.
But You must intercede

510
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:17,499
How can he better you?
Sanjay is the best

511
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:24,276
No Ria. I was over-confident.
But I don't compare with him

512
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:36,358
I think I should cook up an excuse
and leave tomorrow itself

513
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:42,256
Is Anjali there?

514
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:45,259
Where can she go?

515
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:49,469
- I mean, is she there with you?
Can you see her?

516
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,206
Yes, I can see her.

517
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:56,608
- Only Anjali?

518
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:12,823
You see what you're leaving behind?
You did it once

519
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,298
A second time...?
Will you be able to forgive yourself?

520
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,234
Do you still want to come back?

521
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:26,101
No, not without Anjali

522
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,310
And... that Rohit?

523
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:34,647
- Rohit? Forget it, Sanjay is the best

524
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:45,292
There you are Sanju. Anu and Rajesh
are expecting you for breakfast

525
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,664
Is stuffed fried pancakes.
- I prefer this sweet you make

526
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,061
Put that back.
Is for offering to the Gods

527
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,071
Okay

528
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:05,609
Call Anjali. She hasn't had breakfast,
isn't out of bed. Whas she upto?

529
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,681
Say that again.
- Anjali

530
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:16,687
My name sounds so different
when I hear you speak it

531
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:19,462
Say my full name

532
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:26,094
The name thas going to be mine

533
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,203
Anju, your mother wants you downstairs

534
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,213
Put the phone down.

535
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,211
- If you want to go, you disconnect

536
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:50,454
You know it, I can't disconnect
until you disconnect

537
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,493
Disconnect

538
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,722
No, you do it

539
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,896
Les do it
at the count of three

540
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:06,073
One

541
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:08,234
Two

542
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:09,910
Three

543
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:11,943
You haven't disconnected yet

544
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:20,946
No, how many times?

545
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:30,422
Disconnect... Please

546
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,227
Done. Now come on

547
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:36,496
Disconnected?

548
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:50,010
Rohit, your chocolate and ma'am,
your boring strawberry

549
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,956
Whas so boring?
- You'll only find out...

550
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:58,350
Once you try another flavour.
Have you ever tried anything else?

551
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:04,356
None of your fault, though.
Is your life thas so boring

552
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,696
Look at me, some black currant,
some mango, dash of mint

553
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,870
Lollipop, also. Variety my dear,
is the spice of life.

554
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,640
Say what?

555
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,382
But when I look at you,
I think your life's boring too

556
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,887
In your life, I'm sure,
Anjali is the first and last girl

557
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:36,290
You mean, you had girlfriends?
Before Anjali?

558
00:55:54,584 --> 00:56:00,454
Girls, who make friends.
But more girl than friend, yes?

559
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,491
Rohit, how come I know nothing
about your girlfriends?

560
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:13,866
Maybe because... you don't know?
You never told her?

561
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,339
I always wanted to tell you.
But you always said...

562
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,269
you aren't interested in my past.

563
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,342
- I wasn't. Now I am

564
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,741
Me too. Go on tell us.

565
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:31,678
- Fine. Our relationship...
will be grounded in truth.

566
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:35,021
Ask whatever you wish.
You got the right to know

567
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:43,821
What we want to know is,
how many girlfriends?

568
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:47,601
Count

569
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:58,046
I think four, no actually, five.
- Five? How long ago was this fifth?

570
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,509
Say, three months.

571
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:06,052
- When you were seeing me...
you had a girl friend?

572
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:07,579
- Yes, but...

573
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,524
when I saw you for the first time
I realised that you are the girl...

574
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:19,965
I want to spend a lifetime with.
I told her, she understood

575
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:23,133
Really? Thas so amazing!

576
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:26,970
- Why get worked up over that?

577
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:33,204
Everyone has a past. Is natural.
If you had a past, I won't get upset

578
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,741
Anjali's past! I'm Anjali's past!

579
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,222
Boring as her life is...
there was no friend, except me.

580
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,416
No chance of your getting upset

581
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:47,388
Sanjay, don't but in.
Rohit, I'm really hurt

582
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,491
You shouldn't have hidden it from me.

583
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,728
- Whas there to be hidden?

584
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,396
Why didn't you tell me?

585
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,499
- Whas there to be told?

586
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,908
Not to be told and nothing to hide?
Whas this all about?

587
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,835
Nothing. For nothing, Anjali...
- For nothing...?

588
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:10,014
My fiance has had five affairs
and till this day, I don't know?

589
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:13,722
Three happened when I was in school.
- I don't want to hear anything

590
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:18,285
People are staring.

591
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,924
- Not for another minute... do I wish to
embarrass you, Mr. Rohit Khanna

592
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:37,112
Sanju, will you drop me home?
- May I have my ice cream? No...? Okay

593
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:42,017
Got to go

594
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:05,134
You're so nice, but thas
also why you must die

595
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:13,645
You got to go, Rohit. Go away
from Anjali. Far away. Forever

596
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:31,599
Poor guy

597
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:34,799
Was nice

598
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,484
I ought to be thanking you.

599
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:51,418
Even unwittingly...

600
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,245
You've played a major role in
cementing my relationship with Anjali.

601
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:56,156
How so...?

602
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:02,592
- Back in America... Anjali told me about
the swing you rigged up for her.

603
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,158
For her... is a cherished childhood
memory.

604
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,760
And guess what I did? - What?

605
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:13,667
- I rigged a swing too
Then I did it up with flowers,

606
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,537
and I held her eyes shut...

607
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,812
as I took her to sit on the swing
and that was when I asked her...

608
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,017
Anjali, will you marry me?

609
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:32,193
She opened her eyes, saw the swing
And she gave me a quiet smile

610
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:40,468
Till this day I don't know what
she smiled at. Me? Or the swing?

611
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:42,864
The swing, of course

612
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:51,677
Yesterday, Anjali misbehaved with you.
In your place, I'd stop talking to her

613
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:56,609
What? I was about to call her.
- How silly

614
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,018
You see Rajesh?
You'll end up like him. Henpecked

615
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,057
Take my advice, you needn't call her.
- Why?

616
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,288
She fought with you.
Let her apologise

617
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:10,623
But Sanjay...
- Trust me, I know her

618
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:15,136
You needn't say a word. Tonight, at the
engagement, she will apologise

619
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,713
How about a light massage for me?

620
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:31,383
What did he say on the phone?
- Nothing?

621
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:35,651
But he surely said something?
- He never even called

622
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:40,395
Doesn't he call every morning?
- All except this morning

623
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:44,558
Maybe he's jogging.
- That was hours ago

624
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,664
Was he all right?
- He was enjoying himself

625
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:53,900
Said he had a good nighs sleep
and he was looking so fresh

626
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:58,006
I think he's still annoyed.
- Annoyed he is

627
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:02,811
So thas why he never called.
- Thas like a man

628
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:08,847
Not crazy, like me. In his place,
I woulïve called ten times by now

629
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:12,126
And I woulïve realised my mistake
and I woulïve apologised

630
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:15,425
But not Rohit. He'll never do that.

631
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:17,491
Because he knows...

632
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:18,765
If he takes the first step,

633
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,431
you will forever have the upper hand

634
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:27,101
And Rohit is unputdownable.
He's so smart

635
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:34,847
I could never be as clever.
I'll slave for my wife

636
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:48,454
You wanted to say sorry, no?
Go ahead. He isn't stone-hearted

637
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:49,795
He will forgive you.

638
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:52,794
- Why should Anjali apologise?

639
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:56,196
Rohit is to blame for making
a mountain for a molehill

640
01:02:56,472 --> 01:03:01,205
Anu, he is Anjali's fiance.
She can misbehave with her friends

641
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:05,311
She can do it to me. But Rohit...
- I can do it to Rohit too

642
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:11,145
And you needn't take sides with Rohit.
Whose friend are you? Mine or his?

643
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:20,930
And I won't to talk to him unless he
calls me. Tell your clever friend that

644
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:22,225
But Anjali...

645
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:25,399
Anu...

646
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:30,836
Sanjay, you're a genius

647
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:47,412
Nice pair

648
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,749
Could be nicer

649
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:57,729
Could be... someone else?
Could be... you...?

650
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:05,597
Didn't I tell you?
Marriages are made in Heaven

651
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:13,346
And I say, follow your heart
and you can change the world

652
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:20,549
Meaning...?
- Is no more than an engagement

653
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:24,854
Whether it will culminate
in a wedding...?

654
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:35,093
I do not understand...
- Keep watching. You'll get to know

655
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:42,369
The braves will carry
their brides home

656
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:46,380
Why aren't you talking to me?
- I don't want to talk to you

657
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:52,645
Are you annoyed?

658
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,191
Why didn't you call me?
- You didn't call me either

659
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,388
Bachelor party?

660
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:06,330
Will be great fun man!
- What gives you those grins?

661
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:16,074
Tomorrow, we're having
a bachelor's party

662
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:21,013
I said, I don't want to discuss it.
- What would you rather discuss?

663
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:27,155
When are we coming back from America?
- What...?

664
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:32,250
I asked, after the wedding, when do we
come on vacations from America?

665
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,556
Whenever you wish.
Les get married first

666
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:42,101
Are you trying to be evasive?
- Evasive? What are you saying?

667
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:47,334
We got to decide these things
before we get married

668
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,442
Really?
- Yes

669
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:57,116
But make sure no one
gets an inkling

670
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,519
No one gets an inkling.
- Not a soul

671
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:04,258
No one gets to know

672
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,057
No one gets to know, what?
- Nothing

673
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,534
I Rohit Khanna...

674
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,864
swear by God...

675
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:22,535
that after I'm married...

676
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:25,779
My wife Anjali...

677
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,809
once every year...

678
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,808
sometimes twice a year...

679
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:36,586
We never discussed twice a year.
- You said, whenever I wish

680
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,051
Yes, whenever. But twice a year?

681
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:45,466
- Are you trying to tell me... that I
can't come visiting twice a year?

682
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:50,638
The home where I spent my entire
childhood... where my parents live...

683
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:54,307
- Yes Anjali, but in some years...
we might not be able to make it twice

684
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:58,569
I'm a doctor, I got to work,
build a career

685
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:02,915
Your career means everything?
My parents mean nothing?

686
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:09,356
You won't even give me
such a small request?

687
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:29,002
How about celebrating this half
of a wedding over dinner?

688
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:48,686
Already at it?
Wonderful

689
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,498
But why go partying so far away?

690
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:03,842
- These bachelor parties... are best
done on the sly. - But why?

691
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:10,779
Because if we women get to know of
their antics, these men have had it

692
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:16,790
Will there be song and dance?
- And women

693
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:22,956
My sister-in-law says, you got to
see one of these parties...

694
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:29,967
to see what scoundrels men can be.
- Then I'm going, for sure

695
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:35,673
For all his naive looks, who knows
your brother might be a scoundrel

696
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:40,974
I'm going too.
Must see what Naren is upto

697
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:44,648
I got to keep an eye on Raju.
And there's Rohit. Is said...

698
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:50,024
the bachelor who's being given the
party might do just about anything

699
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,154
Les see what Rohit demands

700
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,263
Wonderful party

701
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:03,403
He has organised this party

702
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:27,594
Cigarettes?

703
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:34,329
Ajit too? What a revelation!
- Now I know!

704
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:39,773
Sanju said id be a lively party...
- I know, where are the babes?

705
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:42,602
I can't wait!

706
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:46,780
Be patient and you will
be rewarded, sweetly

707
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:50,280
I don't mind the sours,
but I can't wait

708
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,282
At this grievous juncture...

709
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:57,615
before another bachelor falls
to the blade of matrimony...

710
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,986
here's from me and from the
brotherhood of bachelors...

711
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,197
a requiem, in the words
of Mr Sanjay Malhotra

712
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:07,902
Today, weds my friend.
But I am not happy

713
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:12,699
Love, culminates into marriage.
But I'm far from happy

714
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:16,774
I stopped him, I even tried
to reason with him

715
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,877
For friendship's sake,
I told him

716
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,051
I posed obstacles for him,
I lay a thorn in his path

717
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,289
Like a blossom,
I even tried wilting

718
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,454
He's walking away with the most
beautiful flower of Spring...

719
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,294
is like a wedding in Eden.

720
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,287
But I'm far from happy

721
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:39,462
At my frienïs wedding,
I'm unhappy

722
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,697
Love, culminating into marriage
but I'm far from happy

723
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:27,681
"Swaying, gyrating..."

724
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:48,594
"lighting fires in hearts..."
"with my eyes"

725
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:58,976
"Spark"

726
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:01,648
"I'm a spark"

727
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:57,061
"My body is like flame"
"Don't you get too near"

728
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:02,067
"In the fires of the lamp..."

729
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:06,344
"die those who hover too close"

730
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:12,686
"You loonies..."
"try to understand"

731
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:17,754
"Keep distance..."
"while you watch me"

732
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:25,666
"Spark..."

733
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,129
"I'm spark"

734
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:35,271
"Spark..."

735
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:38,079
"I'm spark"

736
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:12,538
"Like lightning I strike"

737
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:17,985
"Like snake I sting"

738
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:22,981
"I'm the ecstasy
"that makes you swoon"

739
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:27,361
"I can bring out
your true colours"

740
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:33,258
"I can be the fragrance
on your breath"

741
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:38,602
"In a moment..."
"I can sway your heart"

742
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:46,106
"Spark"

743
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:48,945
"I'm spark"

744
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:08,798
"Swaying and gyrating..."
