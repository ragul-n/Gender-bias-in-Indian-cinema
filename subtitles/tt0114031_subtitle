1
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:42,899
Oh darling! This is lndia!

2
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:31,805
Look here! This is heaven, all right!

3
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,166
But you'll have to pay
an entry-fee, buddy!

4
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:38,206
Don't be scared!

5
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:28,985
Well? What's wrong with her?

6
00:05:29,157 --> 00:05:31,953
She seems to be sick
of life, the poor girl!

7
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:37,990
Happens, you know. You do
get upset in our profession.

8
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:40,990
Forget it.
- lt's over, with the night.

9
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:42,650
Another night's about to begin!

10
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:46,656
How'll you manage with
a long face like yours?

11
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:57,697
What happened?
- lt's time for business!

12
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,731
l won't walk the streets today!

13
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:03,625
Then what will you do?
- l'm going to have fun today!

14
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:31,674
Why does everybody break
my dreams in this city!

15
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,000
l have orders, understand?
- To clear the mess, okay?

16
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:39,040
We're expecting VlPs from abroad. Okay?

17
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:42,043
Get lost now... Quick. Go on!

18
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:44,111
You can't sleep here.
- ls that the law?

19
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,042
He's arguing with us! -
He's back-answering us!

20
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,670
Well then... out with the dough.
- How will you get away?

21
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:54,710
Straighten up now!
- Or get locked up for a week!

22
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:57,042
Let me sleep, guys. Please.

23
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,045
Won't you listen to us?!

24
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:04,012
We could slap lPO (lndian Penal Court) Section 95 on you!
- Scream, and get caught!

25
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:08,677
Or even slap Section 93!
- What's that with numbers?

26
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,682
They're sections of the Law.

27
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:13,011
Suppose l agree to go with
you to the police station?

28
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:21,019
You'll regret it. Even the
lnspector will expect a bribe there!

29
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,685
You guys are right. But l have no money.

30
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,022
No money, eh? Who the hell are you?

31
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,055
Who am l?

32
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:41,727
l don't know.

33
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,054
What's your background?
- Where are you from?

34
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:51,731
There's poverty and
starvation... and a sense of pain.

35
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,063
The world is my enemy.
And l'm pretty upset.

36
00:07:57,234 --> 00:07:59,064
Why is that?
- l don't know.

37
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:00,925
But who the hell are you?

38
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:53,850
Who's that?

39
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:58,177
Spend a day in prison, and you'll know.

40
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:03,218
Don't hit me!

41
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:07,822
Don't hit a poor man!
l'm broke and hungry.

42
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,819
l even got thrown out of my shack.

43
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,814
My dreams have brought
me out on the streets!

44
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:15,148
Where do you expect me
to go? Drown in the seas?

45
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:19,791
Don't...! And look at my face!
l was here to be a film-star.

46
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:23,827
But l've ended up a zero! l
had dreams! Of working in films!

47
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:29,828
l dreamt l'd have a bungalow, cars...
and affairs with beautiful women!

48
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,853
l dreamt l'd be written
about in the newspapers.

49
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:36,858
My pictures would be published in
magazines and fancy advertisements.

50
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:39,189
That people would go crazy
trying to get hold of a ticket.

51
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,196
The audience would go
crazy over my performance!

52
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,198
l'd continue to deliver
one hit film after another!

53
00:11:47,936 --> 00:11:49,197
And then?

54
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:51,198
This is lndia, darling!

55
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:55,200
l gave it my best shot! Tried all
l could! But no luck, my friend.

56
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:57,199
May l go now?
- Go on.

57
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,132
Where are you going?
- l told you a story. Let me go.

58
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,805
Now look... don't hit me.

59
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:04,833
Constable!

60
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:08,538
You're clinging to
the sucker, aren't you?

61
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:10,238
Hush! What are you saying?

62
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:15,239
Can't you see? He's broke.
He can't give you anything.

63
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,843
He looks like a perfect rogue.

64
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:24,111
l'm in trouble, all right.
Like a trouble-torn star.

65
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,176
Poor chap! He seems to be an actor.

66
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,846
How did you know?
- lt's all over your face. Struggler!

67
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:37,848
Constable! Let him go.
- No!

68
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,879
Why are you bothering him?
- No!

69
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:45,882
lf you refuse, l'll tattle
in the Superintendent's ear.

70
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:48,211
You'll lose your bribes and your Job!

71
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,887
Give me a kiss and take him away.

72
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:55,611
The rascal!

73
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:05,090
He's escaped, the rascal!

74
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,156
Hungry?
- Yes.

75
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,850
Very hungry?
- Very.

76
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:19,152
Want to eat?
- Yes.

77
00:13:19,862 --> 00:13:22,055
What do l get in return?
- What do you mean?

78
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:24,056
This is lndia, darling!

79
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:27,388
You get nothing for free.
- But what can l give you?

80
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:32,394
Well... let me try this role, too!

81
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:42,067
Don't you touch me! Or
l'll disappear. Like magic.

82
00:13:42,336 --> 00:13:44,359
So what do l do?
- What are you good at?

83
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:50,102
What would an actor be good
at? Entertaining his audience.

84
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:53,438
All right. That's what l want today.

85
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:56,436
l'll buy you a meal today.
But you must entertain me.

86
00:13:56,606 --> 00:13:58,435
Let's have a night of
non-stop entertainment!

87
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:01,469
- ls that a deal?
- Sure, it is.

88
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,470
Let's dedicate the
evening to entertainment.

89
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:11,402
Let's see a sample.

90
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:14,406
l want you dance... and sing.

91
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,078
Show me what's in your
heart... put your life at stake!

92
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:22,380
Show me a dream-like situation,
l've never even heard of.

93
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:26,070
Just... amuse me.

94
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:31,080
Make me laugh.

95
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:37,154
Amazing brains!

96
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:45,890
Your day has arrived!

97
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,552
So, laugh...

98
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:55,226
Your dream will be fulfilled today!

99
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:56,494
So, laugh!

100
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:04,488
You will have lndia
in your clutches today!

101
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,155
So, laugh!

102
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:14,694
Where has your mirth gone?

103
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:17,691
Bloody nincompoop! Laugh!

104
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:21,391
Laugh! Go on!

105
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:44,734
Why can't l realize it...
now that my chance is here?

106
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:49,132
Long live, the Don!

107
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:53,439
lt's time, sir.
- And they have arrived.

108
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,177
Amazing brains l possess!

109
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:09,180
Get me a plate of
chicken, minced-mutton,...

110
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:13,449
No, you don't. Get him a plate
of bread and mashed vegetables.

111
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:16,040
Mashed vegetables?!

112
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:21,451
Parliament has okayed a no-confidence
motion against the Government.

113
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:25,778
The Prime Minister has tendered
his resignation to the President.

114
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:28,484
The resignation has been accepted.

115
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:32,817
Keep it here... Quick!

116
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:37,483
The nation is going through
a very dangerous phase.

117
00:20:38,557 --> 00:20:42,820
On the one hand is the uncertainty
stemming from the resignation...

118
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:45,491
on the other hand is the
growing incidence of terrorism...

119
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:47,750
...in different parts of the country.

120
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:51,488
What makes it worse is the bad
economic condition of the nation.

121
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,123
ln view of all this...

122
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:59,791
President's rule has been
imposed on the country.

123
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:06,465
The army has been alerted to
prepare for any eventuality.

124
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,795
l appeal to the people
to maintain peace...

125
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:21,763
What is your name?

126
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,797
Every man gives me a new
name. l have many of them.

127
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:30,504
Call me anything you wish.

128
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:34,505
Sita! ... No.

129
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:39,803
Gita? Shakuntala, Menka... Saraswati?

130
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:41,636
No, that won't do.

131
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:45,500
Sridevi!

132
00:21:46,611 --> 00:21:47,838
No. None of them fits.

133
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,136
ls that all you can think of?

134
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:04,440
On this dark night, l give you a name.

135
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,480
Miss lndia!

136
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:27,850
And my name is...
- l don't want to know.

137
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,488
My name is...
- l don't want to know, l say!

138
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:33,851
lt's the name that makes man notorious.

139
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,114
Well, all right.

140
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:39,886
The name is...
- The rest come later.

141
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,523
But l'm still hungry!

142
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:45,885
You will have Just as much
food as the fun l have.

143
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:49,124
How'll l have fun on an empty
stomach? And how will l amuse you?

144
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,892
l swear, l...
- Let the oaths be.

145
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:54,891
This is business, darling.
A simple give and take.

146
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,820
What have you done?! lt's something
to sing after eating, you know!

147
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:03,828
To drink in this state... is fun, too.

148
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:10,067
What is she up to?!

149
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:12,534
Forget it, darling. This is lndia!

150
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:49,909
On the night of reckoning... we're out.

151
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:52,577
On a moonlit night... we're out to kiss!

152
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,577
We're in this bad habit!

153
00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:57,575
We're looking for trouble
in the middle of the night!

154
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:02,842
Destruction and mayhem... all the way!

155
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:17,273
Fantastic! Superb!

156
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:39,784
Spoilsport! Out to
ruin my fun, aren't you?

157
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:42,779
The fun begins now.

158
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:49,781
Dump these beggars. And come along.
l'll take you to a 5-star hotel.

159
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:51,045
Get lost!

160
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:56,322
She's all mine!

161
00:31:57,356 --> 00:32:02,256
Look. A necklace for you.
All the way from Dubai.

162
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:04,291
Ask your mother to wear it.

163
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:06,817
You can never have me.

164
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,258
You will have to wear the necklace.

165
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:14,760
Ordering me around, eh?!
l'm the Queen of the Nights!

166
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:18,755
Only the Moon can order me around.

167
00:32:22,531 --> 00:32:24,360
This necklace... you must wear!

168
00:32:24,831 --> 00:32:27,457
You shouldn't be forcing her...
- Don't interfere!

169
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:31,321
Are you enjoying it?
- No.

170
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:35,323
She's not enjoying this!
- Who are you to give her that?

171
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:37,801
She's mine!
- Yours?

172
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:41,295
Can you make her laugh?
No? Can you make her dance?

173
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:45,300
Can you amuse her? No?
You're of no use to her!

174
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:50,505
l'm sorry, but you should have
noticed. That no-entry sign there.

175
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:54,502
There it is... Right behind you.

176
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:08,532
Who might you be?

177
00:33:10,044 --> 00:33:10,976
Me?!

178
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:14,534
l'm the son of the Don!

179
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:52,022
Do the streets belong to your father?

180
00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:54,744
Who owns the world?
- My old man, does!

181
00:38:58,013 --> 00:39:02,879
Amazing brains... Don Kihote has!

182
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:18,385
The world is fast changing, gentlemen.

183
00:39:18,986 --> 00:39:21,418
Big countries are breaking up.

184
00:39:21,553 --> 00:39:23,918
Paving the way for smaller nations.

185
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:29,422
What one makes in this
confusion, belongs to him.

186
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:32,922
And l want lndia.

187
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:38,424
But lndia is no insignificant
or small country.

188
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:41,914
lt can't be won over
by force or aggression.

189
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:46,926
To win lndia, one needs brains.

190
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:55,929
Don Kihote! He has worked
out a terrific scheme.

191
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,464
lt is bound to make you exclaim....

192
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:04,396
Amazing brains... Don Kihote has!

193
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:12,968
lndia is no country. lt's a volcano,
that is simmering with hatred.

194
00:40:13,635 --> 00:40:17,693
lt can erupt at the
smallest of provocations.

195
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:25,961
We have instigated riots and
clashes in lndia for many years.

196
00:40:26,672 --> 00:40:31,572
Over matters of religion,
language, caste and boundaries.

197
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:37,997
We have made an explosive out of
this country, useless otherwise.

198
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:41,509
And that dynamite will explode today.

199
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:48,008
At midnight, our men
will start the riots.

200
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:54,012
We will shed blood. More than
anytime in lndia's history.

201
00:40:55,114 --> 00:40:59,014
Even as the lndian army busies itself
trying to control internal strife...

202
00:40:59,615 --> 00:41:04,981
terrorists from across the border,
from nations that are our friends...

203
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,481
will attack the nation.

204
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:14,986
Amidst all this, we will
kidnap the President of lndia.

205
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,977
We will replace him with a duplicate.
A duplicate we have tutored.

206
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:23,487
The puppet will dance to our tunes!

207
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:29,490
The Government and its troops
will, therefore, be in our control!

208
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:33,522
My word will be the law!

209
00:41:50,697 --> 00:41:53,562
Take us for a drive... please!

210
00:41:55,132 --> 00:41:57,031
Give me a hand...

211
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:10,000
We're going to have fun tonight!

212
00:42:19,105 --> 00:42:22,004
Our country is going through
a very dangerous phase.

213
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:26,031
We are surrounded by
problems and enemies.

214
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,469
From within and outside.

215
00:42:29,108 --> 00:42:32,007
lt is necessary that we remain alert...

216
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:35,509
to face any kind of eventuality.

217
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,072
We have a OBl report, sir.

218
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:41,073
This is an international
conspiracy to ruin lndia.

219
00:42:41,545 --> 00:42:43,034
You could be the target
of an attack, too.

220
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:45,511
Everything seemed to be
all right till yesterday.

221
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:48,578
l wonder what's so wrong that you're
blowing this issue out of proportion.

222
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:50,507
The situation is grave,
sir. lt's our advise....

223
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:53,580
that you cancel all your
engagements for the day.

224
00:42:53,915 --> 00:42:58,076
Should we cancel our engagements
on the basis of rumors...

225
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,445
it would send out the wrong signals
to the people. lt could scare them.

226
00:43:01,684 --> 00:43:04,674
But we can't risk your life, sir.

227
00:43:05,485 --> 00:43:07,452
He is casting aspersions
on our defense capability!

228
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:11,050
We have taken all precautions.
Special Commandos have been posted.

229
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:14,049
We can't put off important decisions
because of a little bit of danger.

230
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:16,011
Dignitaries have arrived
from all over the world.

231
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:20,045
Without their financial help,
this nation will be ruined.

232
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:25,047
The value of the Rupee will plummet.
lnflation will hit the skies.

233
00:43:25,558 --> 00:43:28,548
Unemployment and unrest will
drive the country to anarchy.

234
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:31,556
l must attend this meeting.

235
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:41,755
He's rammed into the
car! Grab him...! Get him!

236
00:43:42,163 --> 00:43:43,095
Get down...

237
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,528
One of those ruffians has
crashed into our truck!

238
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:50,098
Crashed into your truck, eh?

239
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:52,588
Trying to instigate a riot, are you?
- Cool off, sir.

240
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:55,699
We were only Joking...
- You will be punished for it!

241
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:59,100
What for? You didn't let me sleep.
So we decided to get married.

242
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:01,461
Married! Congratulations!

243
00:44:02,102 --> 00:44:03,534
Married, eh?!

244
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:08,536
Have your nuptials in captivity. C'mon!

245
00:44:30,143 --> 00:44:33,076
Who's that?
- The President, don't you know.

246
00:45:02,753 --> 00:45:06,551
Amazing brains... The Don has!

247
00:45:08,621 --> 00:45:13,055
Hats off, doctor...
l salute your skills!

248
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:16,056
l salute the wonders of technology!

249
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:19,517
l salute the magic of plastic surgery!

250
00:45:22,592 --> 00:45:26,549
l have not one... but
5 duplicate presidents!

251
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:37,087
They'd even fool the mirror
with their resemblance!

252
00:45:40,198 --> 00:45:43,097
No power on earth can stop me now!

253
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,688
No one can stop me!

254
00:45:52,768 --> 00:45:54,098
Speak your lines.

255
00:45:55,235 --> 00:45:57,668
This country is... sorry.

256
00:45:58,236 --> 00:46:00,634
This country is passing
through a very dangerous phase.

257
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,602
All problems seem to
have arisen together...

258
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:07,069
Speak.

259
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:12,071
This country is going through
a very dangerous phase.

260
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,673
With so many problems to encounter...

261
00:46:21,176 --> 00:46:23,665
This country is passing
through a very dangerous phase.

262
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:26,076
With so many problems to overcome...

263
00:46:30,345 --> 00:46:31,811
Speak the lines.

264
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,645
This country is passing
through a very dangerous phase.

265
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:40,114
With so many problems...

266
00:46:45,217 --> 00:46:46,706
Go on.

267
00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:50,151
This country is passing
through a very dangerous phase.

268
00:46:50,918 --> 00:46:53,146
There are so many
problems confronting us...

269
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,153
Good. Very good.

270
00:46:58,787 --> 00:47:05,120
But there must be no mistakes
in a dangerous situation.

271
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:09,122
You guys are good, no doubt.

272
00:47:09,757 --> 00:47:13,554
But l need only one man.

273
00:47:20,193 --> 00:47:25,127
Now who, amongst you,
will be the pawn...

274
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:28,827
who will make me realize my goal?

275
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:30,127
You?

276
00:47:31,763 --> 00:47:32,729
You?

277
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:34,694
You?

278
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:36,163
You?

279
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:37,729
You?!

280
00:47:56,238 --> 00:47:58,602
There goes one.

281
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:01,103
And now...

282
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:19,142
There goes another. That
makes my decision easier.

283
00:48:32,815 --> 00:48:35,714
That leaves only the two of you.

284
00:48:36,682 --> 00:48:39,581
Which of you will...

285
00:48:54,688 --> 00:48:58,177
You would have made
it. But you got scared.

286
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:03,748
And those who get scared... die.

287
00:49:17,228 --> 00:49:18,660
The President!

288
00:49:30,231 --> 00:49:32,164
ldiot! Give me your hand!

289
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:39,632
l am your slave!

290
00:49:44,669 --> 00:49:48,625
You must first prove your loyalty.

291
00:50:01,307 --> 00:50:02,739
No... please!

292
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,205
Don't kill me, please!

293
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:16,743
Amazing brains... Don Kihote has!

294
00:50:18,312 --> 00:50:20,745
No one knows my secret.

295
00:50:25,915 --> 00:50:27,779
What's wrong, prince?

296
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:32,780
l've been humiliated in public!
The Don's son has been insulted!

297
00:50:34,851 --> 00:50:39,716
Why must you chase that cheap slut?

298
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:43,285
What don't you do to satisfy your whims?

299
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,786
l am your son, too! l
must have what l want!

300
00:50:50,355 --> 00:50:52,287
When will you grow up, my son?

301
00:50:52,756 --> 00:50:55,279
That silly girl does not love you.

302
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,289
And you don't want to force her either.

303
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:02,257
So what can l do?

304
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,952
What can you do?

305
00:51:05,726 --> 00:51:08,955
You're the Don, they said!
And the Don can do everything!

306
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:10,759
All right.

307
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:14,258
lf you can't do anything...
l'll do something to myself!

308
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:23,764
Amazing brains... Don Kihote has!

309
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:31,299
Get in! Go on!

310
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:41,801
Shame on those who suppress laughter!

311
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:45,294
Shame on those who are against our Joys!

312
00:51:45,872 --> 00:51:49,805
Shame! Shame!

313
00:51:55,374 --> 00:51:58,307
- Who's that? This is Don Kihote.

314
00:51:58,975 --> 00:52:00,737
There's a girl there. ln a red dress.

315
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:03,239
Let her go. She's our babe.

316
00:52:05,944 --> 00:52:09,275
That girl in the red dress...
she's the Don's babe. Let her go.

317
00:52:15,947 --> 00:52:17,846
Now where's the girl in the red dress...

318
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:22,780
You... you have been
released. You may go.

319
00:52:22,949 --> 00:52:24,779
We have been asked to let you go.

320
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,782
How about the rest of them?
- No. Nobody else will go.

321
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:31,751
Now wait... l'm not
going from here either.

322
00:52:32,052 --> 00:52:35,712
Crazy girl! l'm letting her
off. And she refuses to go!

323
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,277
l told you! We'll all go
away, or no one will leave.

324
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,152
She's right. No one leaves.

325
00:52:40,721 --> 00:52:42,312
Why are you bothering us?
- Go away, please.

326
00:52:42,955 --> 00:52:44,819
l've made my condition clear.

327
00:52:45,089 --> 00:52:47,317
Everyone leaves. Else, no one does.

328
00:52:48,023 --> 00:52:50,319
Go and tell your boss.
- She won't go away.

329
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:53,787
Catch us against our will. But
you can't release us like this!

330
00:52:54,024 --> 00:52:58,321
lf you don't listen to her...
- She might kill herself!

331
00:52:58,726 --> 00:53:02,251
l'll kill myself!
- Wait!

332
00:53:02,694 --> 00:53:04,251
Hang on!

333
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:06,252
Think of these pour souls!

334
00:53:08,829 --> 00:53:11,762
Miss lndia! Why do you want
their blood on your hands?

335
00:53:12,364 --> 00:53:15,296
The hands! Show me your palm, mister!

336
00:53:15,965 --> 00:53:17,761
Let me see!

337
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:20,888
Let me see yours!

338
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:27,298
Your days are over!
- How is that?

339
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:30,901
Your palm says it all!

340
00:53:32,402 --> 00:53:33,800
Know why?
- Why?

341
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:38,301
That woman who will kill herself...
is going to be the end of you!

342
00:53:38,738 --> 00:53:40,034
Know why?
- Why?

343
00:53:40,439 --> 00:53:41,905
Use your brains!

344
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:46,339
What happens when the girl
kills herself in the lock-up?

345
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,070
What happens?

346
00:53:48,441 --> 00:53:50,873
The newspapers will carry the
news with your photographs.

347
00:53:52,442 --> 00:53:53,931
''Police atrocities''!

348
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:56,341
''Miss lndia dies in police custody''

349
00:54:01,378 --> 00:54:02,742
Know what happens later?

350
00:54:03,378 --> 00:54:06,277
There'll be an enquiry.
Charges pressed against you.

351
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:07,811
You will...
- Deny it!

352
00:54:07,946 --> 00:54:08,878
They will...
- lt's true!

353
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,309
Things will worsen. The matter
will reach the Supreme Court.

354
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,806
Where these witnesses will
testify against you. And then...

355
00:54:14,915 --> 00:54:19,815
Your wives will be widowed.
Your children will be orphaned!

356
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:23,315
They will roam the streets...
uncared for and unloved!

357
00:54:24,818 --> 00:54:28,775
But, darling, this is lndia.

358
00:54:29,987 --> 00:54:34,353
Anything is possible in this country.
You may perhaps use your influence.

359
00:54:35,421 --> 00:54:38,854
You might bribe them all
to keep their mouths shut.

360
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:42,354
But...
- But?

361
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:44,847
The opposition will not let go.

362
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,856
There will demonstrations and rallies!

363
00:54:49,459 --> 00:54:51,392
This question will figure
in the National Assembly!

364
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:53,850
You will be made to
account for your sins!

365
00:54:54,027 --> 00:54:56,391
There will be agitations! Slogans
will be raised against you!

366
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:58,091
They will hurl stones at you!

367
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:00,326
And then...

368
00:55:01,962 --> 00:55:06,896
your wives will be widowed
and your children, orphaned!

369
00:55:08,398 --> 00:55:12,331
They will roam the streets...
uncared for and unloved!

370
00:55:12,965 --> 00:55:13,897
No!

371
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,897
But, darling... this is lndia.

372
00:55:19,967 --> 00:55:22,366
Anything is possible in this country.

373
00:55:23,002 --> 00:55:26,901
The stones might not find their
mark and you might get away cheaply.

374
00:55:27,436 --> 00:55:29,902
And you might even be transferred.

375
00:55:30,437 --> 00:55:31,869
To Jhumritalaiya.

376
00:55:34,438 --> 00:55:44,864
But while you are spending your hard
- earned bribes with your children...

377
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:50,874
there is a telephone ring.

378
00:55:51,443 --> 00:55:54,410
Who's that?
- This is the Don!

379
00:55:55,478 --> 00:56:01,811
Yes! l had told you that
the girl in red is my babe!

380
00:56:02,014 --> 00:56:04,776
l did my best to let her
go. But she wouldn't agree!

381
00:56:05,414 --> 00:56:10,348
Bastards! How did you let her
die? l won't let you live now!

382
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:15,349
The Don hangs up! And you
break into a cold sweat!

383
00:56:16,018 --> 00:56:20,349
There's a storm outside.
And you can't go to sleep!

384
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:24,851
You are pacing the room when...

385
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,852
a car screeches to a halt
and its doors slam shut!

386
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:31,886
There are these thugs...
with swords and guns!

387
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:43,856
What happens then?

388
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:46,889
Your wives are widowed.

389
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,593
And your children are orphaned.

390
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:57,595
They roam the streets...
unloved and uncared for.

391
00:57:00,064 --> 00:57:04,521
But, darling... this is lndia.

392
00:57:05,232 --> 00:57:07,028
Anything is possible.

393
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:09,062
Maybe we're making a
mountain out of a molehill.

394
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:12,065
The incident might never
make it to the newspapers.

395
00:57:13,134 --> 00:57:15,157
The opposition parties might
never get to know of it.

396
00:57:15,635 --> 00:57:19,068
The Don might even forgive you.

397
00:57:22,237 --> 00:57:23,168
But...

398
00:57:24,238 --> 00:57:29,069
even as you are gambling the
money you've made in bribes...

399
00:57:33,673 --> 00:57:38,607
suddenly... there's the
sound of approaching anklets.

400
00:57:40,709 --> 00:57:42,335
You look around. There's no one.

401
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:44,271
You look further... there's no one.

402
00:57:44,543 --> 00:57:46,100
You look everywhere... there's no one!

403
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:59,070
Who is it?
- Miss lndia.

404
00:57:59,648 --> 00:58:01,546
But she's supposed to be dead!

405
00:58:02,215 --> 00:58:04,545
lt the ghost!

406
00:58:10,184 --> 00:58:14,084
Our wives will be orphaned.
- And our children, widowed!

407
00:58:15,253 --> 00:58:19,118
They will roam the streets...
- Uncared for and unloved.

408
00:58:21,254 --> 00:58:25,120
For one little mistake,
your wives and children...

409
00:58:25,256 --> 00:58:28,189
No! Let them go!

410
00:58:29,689 --> 00:58:31,121
Give me the keys!

411
00:58:31,423 --> 00:58:34,117
l will kill myself!
- No! They have agreed.

412
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:36,590
Sure?
- Sure?

413
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:39,120
Okay, then. My death has been canceled!

414
00:58:44,294 --> 00:58:45,658
One moment!

415
00:58:46,295 --> 00:58:49,160
l have a condition.
- You mustn't move about together.

416
00:58:49,729 --> 00:58:52,162
That's the order. From up above.
- No more trouble, okay?

417
00:58:52,297 --> 00:58:54,661
Not at all. May we go?
- Go on!

418
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:05,599
We're all our own again.
Our troupe has dispersed.

419
00:59:06,234 --> 00:59:07,598
And what now?

420
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:11,901
''She and l were together...
there was romance in the air''

421
00:59:12,535 --> 00:59:15,900
''l was heading for
Japan and got to China''

422
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:18,571
What does that mean?
- lt means...

423
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:21,436
Love! Love!
- Love?

424
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:26,430
Love? l see!

425
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,937
So that's the new item, isn't it?

426
00:59:32,008 --> 00:59:37,374
Love is no item. Love
is... love, after all.

427
00:59:39,311 --> 00:59:42,368
lt's a way of life.
The power of worship.

428
00:59:42,611 --> 00:59:44,441
A storm of emotions...
a flight dreams take!

429
00:59:47,012 --> 00:59:48,478
Love!

430
00:59:55,048 --> 00:59:55,980
Get lost!

431
00:59:58,049 --> 00:59:59,982
What impertinence is that?

432
01:00:03,051 --> 01:00:06,484
Not me. lt's you whose
into a lot of impertinence!

433
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:10,486
You've been teaching her
lessons in love? Her?!

434
01:00:12,053 --> 01:00:16,487
You've ruined half the night
for this bum! C'mon now!

435
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,484
Leave me alone...
- Where are you going?!

436
01:00:19,055 --> 01:00:21,488
l will not walk the streets.
- Are you crazy?

437
01:00:22,556 --> 01:00:25,489
l've got three customers
lined up. They've even paid me.

438
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,522
Let's go.
- Not today, l say!

439
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:31,024
Now listen. We have no
Sundays in our business.

440
01:00:32,092 --> 01:00:34,025
Whores have a short life anyway.

441
01:00:34,693 --> 01:00:37,024
Youth is a thing of the past
even before you realize it.

442
01:00:37,527 --> 01:00:42,757
So make the best of it!
Nobody will care for you later.

443
01:00:42,929 --> 01:00:44,327
Not today, please.

444
01:00:45,096 --> 01:00:47,528
Let go of her! And watch your tongue!

445
01:00:48,097 --> 01:00:51,030
The Prince, eh? To save
the damsel in distress!

446
01:00:52,098 --> 01:00:54,031
l'll smash your face!

447
01:00:56,633 --> 01:01:00,464
She's no princess, you
know? She's a whore!

448
01:01:01,068 --> 01:01:04,001
Ask her... she has a price.

449
01:01:05,402 --> 01:01:07,595
Take her away... if
you're carrying the money.

450
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,602
You're broke, aren't you?

451
01:01:12,071 --> 01:01:16,004
No wonder! Only those who
are broke, think of her!

452
01:01:17,072 --> 01:01:19,005
Bastard! l'll clobber you!

453
01:01:21,074 --> 01:01:22,005
Don't hit him!

454
01:01:33,577 --> 01:01:35,600
Stop it! Let him go!

455
01:01:36,144 --> 01:01:39,543
l'll get even with
you! Just you watch...

456
01:01:42,146 --> 01:01:46,045
Why did you come away?
l'd have killed him!

457
01:01:46,548 --> 01:01:48,037
You won't touch him!

458
01:01:48,648 --> 01:01:50,046
Just do as you are told!

459
01:01:51,148 --> 01:01:54,047
Now make me laugh... l want to laugh!

460
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:57,908
l won't cry today. l
won't recall anything.

461
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,980
l won't let anything
stop me... not even you!

462
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,019
Well... what were you talking about?

463
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,554
Love.

464
01:02:21,124 --> 01:02:25,558
Love is the intoxication that
robs of you of peace and sleep.

465
01:02:28,126 --> 01:02:31,025
You feel like talking to the other...

466
01:02:31,628 --> 01:02:34,527
of belonging to her and
making her belong to you.

467
01:02:34,862 --> 01:02:36,555
One feels like living!

468
01:02:38,162 --> 01:02:41,095
Love is the spring of life where
blossom the roses of imagination!

469
01:02:41,464 --> 01:02:43,090
Love gives poetry its music.

470
01:02:43,664 --> 01:02:48,598
lt evokes desire, spawns
off a thousand stories...

471
01:02:48,733 --> 01:02:50,097
and it gives ecstasy.

472
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:56,100
Love gives the future a meaning;
it gives the past an identity.

473
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:59,094
lt brings two strangers together.

474
01:02:59,669 --> 01:03:02,033
lt gives a Journey its destination.

475
01:03:03,104 --> 01:03:04,468
Love, eh?

476
01:03:06,604 --> 01:03:08,571
That's right up my alley!

477
01:08:40,802 --> 01:08:42,894
l saved you from the police.

478
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:45,400
But who will save you from me?

479
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:49,404
You haven't stopped following her.

480
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:51,796
lt's you who hasn't
stopped following us.

481
01:08:52,473 --> 01:08:53,803
And what are you doing here?

482
01:08:54,007 --> 01:08:57,804
We thought you'd be crying, with
your head in your father's lap.

483
01:08:59,408 --> 01:09:00,738
Have you forgotten the beating?

484
01:09:01,675 --> 01:09:05,336
She goes with me.
- No.

485
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,642
You will go with me! Okay?

486
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:10,741
Didn't you hear her refuse?

487
01:09:12,545 --> 01:09:13,340
No!

488
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,379
C'mon! Let's get the hell out of here!

489
01:10:19,531 --> 01:10:20,429
No!

490
01:11:34,553 --> 01:11:38,487
l'm scared. l'm feeling like
crying! Don't let me cry... please!

491
01:11:39,555 --> 01:11:41,521
No problem. Here goes...

492
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:56,048
How long can we run like this?
He's powerful. He can do anything.

493
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,822
Don't worry, Miss
lndia. He can't harm you.

494
01:11:58,994 --> 01:12:00,460
But he will kill you. For sure.

495
01:12:00,761 --> 01:12:02,989
Good. We can now remain together.

496
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:05,791
You save me. And l'll save you.

497
01:12:05,962 --> 01:12:07,451
You don't know whom you are taking on.

498
01:12:07,663 --> 01:12:09,788
His father is the Don. He
terrorizes the whole of lndia.

499
01:12:11,531 --> 01:12:13,725
l'd better go to him and
put an end this drama.

500
01:12:14,532 --> 01:12:17,499
l got punched on the nose for
you! And you're going to him!

501
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:24,490
All right. Go on...
Who am l to stop you?

502
01:12:24,835 --> 01:12:27,802
l'm a loafer, right?
A vagabond... a tramp!

503
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:30,800
You are at least alive. And
you won't be, if l hang around.

504
01:12:30,969 --> 01:12:33,800
l'd rather die than lead a
meaningless life like this!

505
01:12:34,571 --> 01:12:38,800
Whenever l have loved something,
they've snatched it away from me!

506
01:12:39,139 --> 01:12:41,731
My parents... my house and now my life!

507
01:12:42,573 --> 01:12:43,834
What do you mean?

508
01:12:44,574 --> 01:12:48,507
Don't leave me, please!

509
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:55,843
l know. This is not
part of our arrangement.

510
01:12:56,877 --> 01:13:04,438
But l need you... l'm
scared. Terribly scared.

511
01:13:04,946 --> 01:13:06,435
Of what?

512
01:13:10,548 --> 01:13:11,480
Death.

513
01:13:13,782 --> 01:13:15,772
l don't have much time now.

514
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:19,483
The doctors have diagnosed cancer.

515
01:13:22,552 --> 01:13:27,486
l don't want to die...
l don't want to die!

516
01:13:36,589 --> 01:13:39,488
You won't leave now, will you?
- No.

517
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:48,482
Wasn't that fun! Crying
is always fun, isn't it?

518
01:13:48,959 --> 01:13:51,518
Were you Joking?!
- Of course.

519
01:13:57,762 --> 01:13:59,786
That's all right. But
it was fun, wasn't it?

520
01:14:00,563 --> 01:14:02,462
Yes.
- So let me have a fiver.

521
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:05,795
l'm hungry, but l won't settle for
bread and mashed vegetables, okay?

522
01:14:15,601 --> 01:14:21,501
Your appearance and destiny...
everything has changed!

523
01:14:21,869 --> 01:14:23,927
But you are still as lecherous as ever!

524
01:14:26,871 --> 01:14:28,860
You are going places, Nathuram!

525
01:14:30,605 --> 01:14:31,866
The President...!

526
01:14:39,874 --> 01:14:41,864
Strange games You do play, O Lord!

527
01:14:43,843 --> 01:14:47,071
Not even You can save the country now!

528
01:15:00,147 --> 01:15:02,511
What are you doing?! Let me go!

529
01:15:02,714 --> 01:15:04,943
People don't Just hear... they even see!

530
01:15:05,149 --> 01:15:07,775
That's all right. This
is Just for a few moments.

531
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:15,512
l'm going to be the President...
and you will be my wife!

532
01:15:15,818 --> 01:15:16,681
My wife!

533
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:25,844
Don't be scared, darling.
My little firework!

534
01:15:28,622 --> 01:15:30,884
l wasn't born old, you know.

535
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:34,890
But this what power does to you.

536
01:15:35,624 --> 01:15:39,887
Come to power... and you feel the itch.

537
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:47,560
You understand the itch,
don't you? The itch?

538
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:57,553
An itching mind... an itching
body. And then, the itch to do it!

539
01:16:03,032 --> 01:16:05,498
Let me go, please!

540
01:16:05,867 --> 01:16:07,856
All right. Go on.

541
01:16:08,601 --> 01:16:10,863
l'll let you go!

542
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:16,535
But how can l let you go?

543
01:16:25,005 --> 01:16:25,937
What's going on?

544
01:16:28,006 --> 01:16:29,064
l've made a mistake!

545
01:16:38,476 --> 01:16:44,308
Bloody idiot! Can't you
see what is good for you?

546
01:16:46,045 --> 01:16:48,977
l'm elevating you to the
highest seat of the land.

547
01:16:50,046 --> 01:16:51,978
And you... you're down on your knees!

548
01:16:53,346 --> 01:16:59,178
Nothing is hidden from me.
Remember! l see everything!

549
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,909
You will do nothing without my consent!

550
01:17:04,017 --> 01:17:05,244
Very well, sir.

551
01:17:08,018 --> 01:17:11,281
Have you read the files?
- Yes, sir.

552
01:17:12,019 --> 01:17:14,282
Have you memorized what
you will say on television?

553
01:17:14,452 --> 01:17:15,941
Yes, sir... l have.

554
01:17:16,287 --> 01:17:17,913
Do you understand everything else?

555
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:19,652
Yes, sir.

556
01:17:20,022 --> 01:17:21,420
What ''Yes, sir'' !

557
01:17:22,022 --> 01:17:24,285
l understand, sir.

558
01:17:24,489 --> 01:17:28,287
What?
- l... understand, sir.

559
01:17:30,457 --> 01:17:31,946
Do you stammer?

560
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:33,947
No, sir.
- What?

561
01:17:34,392 --> 01:17:37,951
Well, sometimes,... l do.

562
01:17:41,527 --> 01:17:46,427
Damn it! Can nothing go
right in this bloody country?!

563
01:17:48,596 --> 01:17:50,028
Bloody fake!

564
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:53,991
Do you know how difficult it
has been to conceive this plan?

565
01:17:54,264 --> 01:17:56,322
The years it has taken
for this moment to arrive?

566
01:17:57,098 --> 01:17:59,929
The effort it has taken
to make you what you are?

567
01:18:00,433 --> 01:18:02,366
And l find you stammering?!

568
01:18:03,034 --> 01:18:05,933
l'm going to kill you!

569
01:18:06,302 --> 01:18:07,529
And what happens of your plans then?

570
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:14,002
l'm the only one you can bank on.

571
01:18:15,071 --> 01:18:17,970
You have killed the others.

572
01:18:19,339 --> 01:18:22,999
lt's l who has to ruin this country now.

573
01:18:29,075 --> 01:18:31,007
Don't worry, sir.

574
01:18:31,475 --> 01:18:33,408
l'm normal, once l
have rehearsed my lines.

575
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:38,009
Try me out; This nation is going
through a dangerous phase...

576
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:40,268
Stop it.
- See that, don't you?

577
01:18:43,112 --> 01:18:46,375
l'm amazed how you even passed the test!

578
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:53,380
Why didn't l detect your weakness?
- Nobody can, sir. Not even God.

579
01:18:53,515 --> 01:18:56,039
Or why would this
country be in such a mess?

580
01:18:56,449 --> 01:19:00,315
One's got to hide his
shortcomings. Or he's dead.

581
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:04,984
May l ask you something, sir?

582
01:19:05,452 --> 01:19:09,317
lt's not for pawns to question.
You will only obey orders.

583
01:19:10,054 --> 01:19:13,987
lt's on the tip of my tongue,
sir. lt might cause me problems...

584
01:19:14,355 --> 01:19:16,981
and l might go off-track, you know.

585
01:19:19,089 --> 01:19:21,420
Don't you ever blink, sir?

586
01:19:24,091 --> 01:19:26,353
Blink, and the tables turn.

587
01:19:27,326 --> 01:19:33,282
Blink and your game is over.
Your destiny goes to the dogs.

588
01:19:34,094 --> 01:19:36,356
Blink, and doomsday is upon you!

589
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:45,020
When one blinks... he sleeps
for that one brief moment.

590
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:48,362
And sleep is death.

591
01:19:49,398 --> 01:19:52,024
Man must never go to sleep!

592
01:19:54,334 --> 01:19:56,630
Understand?
- You're a great man, sir!

593
01:19:57,467 --> 01:20:02,401
And l can't sleep either.
My dreams don't let me.

594
01:20:03,135 --> 01:20:06,591
The moment l shut my eyes,
l'm obsessed by my nightmares!

595
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:13,063
ldiot! You are scared of nightmares!
How will you change your destiny?

596
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:21,397
l'm not as stupid as you think.
- l know what you are!

597
01:20:23,475 --> 01:20:27,067
But don't you begin to think
that you are very smart!

598
01:20:27,509 --> 01:20:31,102
That will be your
biggest act of stupidity!

599
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:50,115
Creating you was difficult, Nathuram.

600
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:52,809
But it is easier to destroy you.

601
01:20:56,751 --> 01:21:00,082
Remember. You will only play your part.

602
01:21:01,152 --> 01:21:03,415
And l will decide the course of events!

603
01:21:04,153 --> 01:21:07,416
Amazing brains... of Don Kihote!

604
01:21:17,591 --> 01:21:19,023
No...

605
01:21:20,692 --> 01:21:25,421
Don't do it! No way!

606
01:21:26,194 --> 01:21:28,092
l have a clean heart.
Every sin is allowed.

607
01:21:28,461 --> 01:21:29,654
But you can't steal!

608
01:21:30,228 --> 01:21:33,127
Who's stealing? Let's ask...

609
01:21:33,729 --> 01:21:38,129
Would you mind if l
borrowed your clothes, lady?

610
01:21:38,364 --> 01:21:40,456
You're not in the rat-race
of human-beings anyway.

611
01:21:40,631 --> 01:21:42,120
You don't need those clothes.

612
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:47,466
See? She's quiet! And
that's the green-signal.

613
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:52,124
Ask him, if you want to.
- Really? But then...

614
01:21:52,401 --> 01:21:53,424
Ask him!

615
01:21:55,636 --> 01:21:59,433
You're wearing nice clothes, mister.
Could l have them for the night?

616
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:01,059
Trying to woo the girl?!

617
01:22:03,204 --> 01:22:07,467
l can't impress a girl
with dirty such clothes.

618
01:22:07,605 --> 01:22:10,072
Let me have yours for the night. Please!

619
01:22:10,306 --> 01:22:11,637
All right!

620
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:14,469
Hear that, Miss lndia? He
does have a large-heart!

621
01:22:16,241 --> 01:22:19,140
You have an amazing hair-style...
and your wife, she's a wow!

622
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:21,098
Don't you have any kids?

623
01:22:29,646 --> 01:22:34,137
Lady from Heaven... what
punishment do we bear for this?

624
01:22:36,781 --> 01:22:40,509
lt'll be 1 minutes before someone
appears. By then, we'll flee!

625
01:23:02,589 --> 01:23:04,111
Don't look at me.
- Of course not.

626
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:18,158
Look away!

627
01:23:46,801 --> 01:23:49,200
You do look like a gentleman!

628
01:23:52,202 --> 01:23:54,192
What's wrong?
- My head is swimming!

629
01:23:57,271 --> 01:23:59,135
You look ravishing!

630
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:04,138
Let's go! Hurry... Or we'll get caught!

631
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:09,140
Bye, mister... don't you tell anyone!

632
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:11,440
Out the drama... let's go!

633
01:24:31,248 --> 01:24:34,272
This way... C'mon!
- No! There are cops there!

634
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:36,279
Yes. But they'll save
us from the other cops.

635
01:24:36,849 --> 01:24:38,281
C'mon! And keep that bag there.

636
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:40,281
No.
- Pick it up later! Now come on!

637
01:24:48,886 --> 01:24:50,819
Looks like l've seen you earlier.

638
01:24:53,387 --> 01:24:56,786
See? You've been fooled,
too! You must've met my twin!

639
01:24:57,889 --> 01:25:00,754
Same here! l mean, you
must've met my twin too!

640
01:25:01,223 --> 01:25:04,451
Actually, name is Ram. And he's...
- Shyam?

641
01:25:06,825 --> 01:25:09,257
My name is Geeta. And hers is...
- Seeta?

642
01:25:09,826 --> 01:25:10,757
They know it all!

643
01:25:11,226 --> 01:25:14,454
We were kids when we
were separated at a fair.

644
01:25:14,827 --> 01:25:18,760
At the fair of Kumbh?
- There! He knows everything!

645
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:22,318
Even our mothers were fooled, you know.

646
01:25:22,596 --> 01:25:24,494
But you need not be fooled.

647
01:25:24,863 --> 01:25:27,796
Look at them... the tramps! And
look at us... rich and elite.

648
01:25:28,432 --> 01:25:30,796
All suited and booted...

649
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:33,792
Where does one leave from?
- This way, please. Go on.

650
01:25:34,866 --> 01:25:36,355
The lnspector's here!

651
01:25:42,369 --> 01:25:44,301
Where have we arrived?

652
01:25:46,869 --> 01:25:48,358
ln fairyland.

653
01:25:55,472 --> 01:25:58,337
l don't want any mistake.
- Don't worry, sir.

654
01:25:58,773 --> 01:26:00,205
Have you checked the fuse of the ribbon?

655
01:26:00,441 --> 01:26:02,771
Yes. lt'll explode the moment it
comes in contact with the scissor.

656
01:26:21,447 --> 01:26:24,471
Everything is now in
your hands, Nathuram.

657
01:26:25,548 --> 01:26:27,276
l don't want even a second's delay.

658
01:26:27,816 --> 01:26:29,077
Do you understand?

659
01:26:29,882 --> 01:26:31,815
...and stop stammering!
- l understand, sir.

660
01:26:32,183 --> 01:26:33,548
Take him to his position.

661
01:26:52,355 --> 01:26:56,311
Moving around with you reminds
me of my childhood, Miss lndia.

662
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:57,820
Let's play cops and thieves.

663
01:26:58,357 --> 01:27:01,256
l'm the thief... Look for me!

664
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,292
Who are you?

665
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:11,293
How did you get in?

666
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:15,294
What have you seen?

667
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:20,295
Seen? l've seen nothing!
l don't ever see anything!

668
01:27:20,464 --> 01:27:22,260
l've never seen anything!

669
01:27:23,465 --> 01:27:27,796
Are you blind?
- Yes! How did you know?

670
01:27:28,866 --> 01:27:36,290
l was born blind. l
was brought up blind.

671
01:27:36,936 --> 01:27:38,834
You talk of seeing.

672
01:27:39,636 --> 01:27:43,831
And l've yet to set the Sun,
the Moon, the night and the day.

673
01:27:44,437 --> 01:27:48,337
l haven't seen a movie yet!

674
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:57,374
Give me that hand,
uncle... Give it to me!

675
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:04,475
Where were you, Miss lndia? l
lost my way, looking for you!

676
01:28:04,877 --> 01:28:06,309
And l met this nice man.

677
01:28:06,444 --> 01:28:07,774
This is Miss lndia, mister.

678
01:28:09,479 --> 01:28:10,775
l can't get this!

679
01:28:11,179 --> 01:28:14,509
How are people getting in
despite all the security?!

680
01:28:14,947 --> 01:28:16,846
Who are they, uncle?

681
01:28:17,614 --> 01:28:19,342
Let's hurry, Don. They're arriving.

682
01:28:19,914 --> 01:28:23,814
The amazing brains of Don Kihote!

683
01:28:24,416 --> 01:28:25,814
Where is he?

684
01:28:28,218 --> 01:28:28,842
Catch him!

685
01:29:43,672 --> 01:29:46,366
Mr. Dhirubhai Malpani,
Ohairman, Export-lndia.

686
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:50,371
This is Mr. Kihote. The
wealthiest non-resident lndian.

687
01:29:50,574 --> 01:29:52,404
The progress of our
country lies in your hands.

688
01:29:57,476 --> 01:29:59,909
And this is...
- Miss lndia!

689
01:30:00,277 --> 01:30:01,403
Greetings!

690
01:30:01,978 --> 01:30:04,911
And l... l'm an ordinary man.

691
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:07,411
lt's the ordinary citizen
who helps the country.

692
01:30:27,019 --> 01:30:28,951
This way, sir... Please come along!

693
01:30:34,021 --> 01:30:36,453
Mr. President! Your glasses!

694
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:43,949
Let's go, sir.

695
01:31:07,731 --> 01:31:11,425
The amazing brains.. of Don Kihote!

696
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,432
Gentlemen!

697
01:31:19,868 --> 01:31:22,834
Now begins our Operation Storm!

698
01:31:24,002 --> 01:31:26,833
lt will blow away the
lndependence of this country!

699
01:31:27,403 --> 01:31:32,064
And l will be the King of lndia!

700
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:37,365
l will press a button here,
...and the nation will explode!

701
01:31:37,906 --> 01:31:39,338
Riots will be sparked off!

702
01:31:39,873 --> 01:31:44,364
You will see the nation's destruction!

703
01:31:44,775 --> 01:31:46,866
Right here and now...

704
01:31:47,475 --> 01:31:51,374
not in flesh and blood;
on close-circuit TV!

705
01:32:20,885 --> 01:32:25,376
When l was a child, l
used to cry for the Moon.

706
01:32:27,454 --> 01:32:29,886
My mother used to say,
''Grow up soon...''

707
01:32:30,455 --> 01:32:33,354
''and you can snatch
the Moon from the skies''

708
01:32:35,489 --> 01:32:37,388
The moon looks beautiful
from a distance.

709
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:39,889
At close quarters,
it's full of blemishes.

710
01:32:41,491 --> 01:32:44,424
l wouldn't mind that.
- Let's stop this nonsense.

711
01:32:46,492 --> 01:32:48,425
Why are you so scared?

712
01:32:49,493 --> 01:32:55,428
We might go a bit too far.
- So? This is life.

713
01:32:57,496 --> 01:32:59,359
What do you know about life?

714
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:02,353
You make fun of everything.

715
01:33:03,431 --> 01:33:04,863
Not true, Miss lndia...

716
01:33:05,432 --> 01:33:06,864
Yes! He's the one!

717
01:33:08,466 --> 01:33:09,898
Get him!

718
01:34:04,182 --> 01:34:06,672
You dare back-answer me?!

719
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:22,418
Start the car! Quick!

720
01:34:24,088 --> 01:34:25,918
Wait, you bastard...

721
01:34:26,955 --> 01:34:29,286
Let him go! Leave him alone!

722
01:34:34,491 --> 01:34:36,923
Who's that man?
- Let me go!

723
01:34:37,092 --> 01:34:39,423
You aren't scared of anything...
but why are you scared of him?

724
01:34:40,226 --> 01:34:42,022
Forget it!
- How can l?

725
01:34:42,493 --> 01:34:46,427
He knows you. He tried to kill
me! And you want to save him!

726
01:34:46,794 --> 01:34:48,852
Who is he?
- What will you do?

727
01:34:49,129 --> 01:34:51,425
You must tell me! Who is he?

728
01:34:52,963 --> 01:34:57,192
My father! He's my father!

729
01:34:57,998 --> 01:35:03,399
He pimps for his daughter!
He beats me up, when l refuse!

730
01:35:25,506 --> 01:35:27,938
Why don't you run away?

731
01:35:29,507 --> 01:35:33,406
Where will l go? l don't trust anyone.

732
01:35:38,043 --> 01:35:40,942
Stop crying... okay?

733
01:35:51,747 --> 01:35:52,179
See the blemish now?

734
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:56,681
Let's get out of here.

735
01:36:01,183 --> 01:36:02,672
What's this?
- What?

736
01:36:03,717 --> 01:36:06,411
What are you hiding?
- l'm keeping it. Not hiding it.

737
01:36:09,019 --> 01:36:11,918
Photographs. l'm an actor, you see.

738
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,948
l've always wanted to be one.

739
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:17,949
And the villagers said, ''He's crazy!''

740
01:36:18,088 --> 01:36:19,952
''Send him away to the
city. He'll be all right''

741
01:36:20,088 --> 01:36:21,952
They took these pictures
and sent me here...

742
01:36:31,759 --> 01:36:35,454
But the doctors here
say, l have no future.

743
01:36:39,762 --> 01:36:41,990
My time is up.

744
01:36:43,763 --> 01:36:45,195
So that wasn't a Joke.

745
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:48,926
You really have cancer!

746
01:37:10,037 --> 01:37:13,970
Look... you see the blemish, don't you?

747
01:37:27,742 --> 01:37:30,675
Burn it down! Get them!

748
01:37:40,279 --> 01:37:41,711
Let's go! C'mon!

749
01:37:56,984 --> 01:37:59,849
Tonight seems to be
the night of apocalypse!

750
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,149
Please! Stop it!

751
01:38:14,122 --> 01:38:15,418
Listen to me!

752
01:42:01,022 --> 01:42:03,284
What's wrong, son?

753
01:42:04,057 --> 01:42:05,989
l have a problem, dad!

754
01:42:07,258 --> 01:42:11,521
We are celebrating tonight...
and you're mourning!

755
01:42:14,793 --> 01:42:16,316
l've lost her again!

756
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,527
l need an army of
your thugs to find her.

757
01:42:19,694 --> 01:42:23,525
Not today. They're all on duty.

758
01:42:24,695 --> 01:42:26,525
All right. l'll go and
look for her myself.

759
01:42:26,696 --> 01:42:28,525
No! You will not go anywhere!

760
01:42:29,564 --> 01:42:34,520
l've no importance at all! You Just
don't care! So l can go anywhere!

761
01:42:34,698 --> 01:42:38,188
Riots have broken out everywhere!
There's danger in the city!

762
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:42,033
Danger? She must be in danger, too.

763
01:42:43,101 --> 01:42:45,727
Where are you going? ...stop him!

764
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:08,967
My child! Let me save him!

765
01:43:10,376 --> 01:43:12,968
Back... get back!

766
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:12,020
We don't know where he's gone, sir.
- Go and look for him!

767
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:15,022
People are rioting out there.
- So get them to stop the riots!

768
01:44:15,228 --> 01:44:17,353
That's not possible, sir.
- Not possible?

769
01:44:18,129 --> 01:44:22,028
l have instigated the
riots. l can stop them, too!

770
01:44:22,263 --> 01:44:24,389
People are killing each
other. They can't be stopped.

771
01:44:25,131 --> 01:44:27,393
lt isn't advisable for you
to go out in this situation.

772
01:44:28,132 --> 01:44:31,031
But he's my son!
- But where will you look for him?

773
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,195
ln hell! Let's go!

774
01:44:52,506 --> 01:44:55,064
Leave me alone...

775
01:45:01,715 --> 01:45:04,410
What did you think? That
you'd escape the son of Don?

776
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,745
l'd have found you even in hell!

777
01:45:16,053 --> 01:45:17,020
No!

778
01:45:35,092 --> 01:45:37,581
So this is your hero!

779
01:45:41,527 --> 01:45:43,721
Or is he... the Joker?

780
01:45:56,898 --> 01:45:57,830
Dance...

781
01:45:59,932 --> 01:46:01,922
Dance, l say!
- Hold it!

782
01:46:17,505 --> 01:46:18,766
Wait...

783
01:46:36,077 --> 01:46:37,475
Stop the bloody riots!

784
01:46:37,811 --> 01:46:41,471
This is Don Kihote! ...Stop rioting!

785
01:46:50,548 --> 01:46:52,480
Let me go!

786
01:46:55,549 --> 01:46:56,913
You cheap muscle-flexing thug!

787
01:46:57,550 --> 01:47:00,744
You can bring me here forcibly! But
you can't make me change my mind!

788
01:47:00,917 --> 01:47:02,747
Forcibly? Damn it!

789
01:47:02,985 --> 01:47:04,746
l forced you only to save your life!

790
01:47:04,951 --> 01:47:06,417
There are riots out there!

791
01:47:06,652 --> 01:47:10,449
You've done me a favour, have you?
- What am l to do with you...?

792
01:47:11,521 --> 01:47:14,454
Don't come closer! l'll rip you apart!

793
01:47:16,622 --> 01:47:19,453
Get any closer, and l'll kill myself!

794
01:47:21,524 --> 01:47:23,786
You can make love to my corpse then!

795
01:47:33,894 --> 01:47:35,451
Crazy! l'm crazy!

796
01:47:35,861 --> 01:47:39,453
l could have had you abducted
and treated you any way l wished!

797
01:47:39,695 --> 01:47:41,491
And no one would have uttered a word!

798
01:47:41,929 --> 01:47:47,488
But l'm crazy! l wanted you to love me!

799
01:47:47,931 --> 01:47:49,192
Never!
- And why not?

800
01:47:49,598 --> 01:47:53,497
What do l lack? l look like a
hero! l'm a super hit with everyone!

801
01:47:53,866 --> 01:47:56,833
l have style that could
cause a traffic-Jam!

802
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:00,431
l'm the life of high-society; a
dashing, swash-buckling fighter!

803
01:48:00,668 --> 01:48:02,861
l know every trick. And
l'm a fantastic lover.

804
01:48:03,069 --> 01:48:04,001
So?

805
01:48:17,573 --> 01:48:20,472
What must l do?! What am l to do?

806
01:48:22,575 --> 01:48:25,837
Hey, hero... you can't do a thing!

807
01:48:27,576 --> 01:48:29,838
Where must l look for her?!

808
01:48:31,577 --> 01:48:34,840
Find yourself first. Where
will you look for her?!

809
01:48:35,578 --> 01:48:37,511
She's in danger.

810
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:41,512
Know how much of a danger
that place poses for you?

811
01:48:43,614 --> 01:48:44,910
There's danger everywhere.

812
01:48:46,615 --> 01:48:50,878
This is no play. This is life.
With real thugs. Real danger.

813
01:48:51,016 --> 01:48:53,540
How long have you known her
anyway? For how many hours?

814
01:48:54,017 --> 01:48:55,881
Emotions know no time.

815
01:48:56,617 --> 01:49:01,483
Emotions? Run away, buddy...
if you care for you life!

816
01:49:07,555 --> 01:49:09,487
Here you are... take this.

817
01:52:37,983 --> 01:52:40,643
But why?
- What is that?

818
01:52:42,751 --> 01:52:44,683
Why must you love ''me'' ?

819
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:47,017
Because you are who you are.

820
01:52:47,752 --> 01:52:52,015
And why don't you love me.
- Because you are what you are!

821
01:52:55,321 --> 01:52:58,015
You're going to regret
this! You're really going to!

822
01:53:16,728 --> 01:53:18,058
O God...

823
01:53:19,729 --> 01:53:24,662
Whoever You are...
and wherever You are...

824
01:53:27,164 --> 01:53:31,655
help me today. Please!

825
01:53:32,065 --> 01:53:33,053
Hero!

826
01:53:33,733 --> 01:53:35,665
They've taken Miss lndia away!

827
01:53:36,734 --> 01:53:38,064
Do you know the place?
- Yes!

828
01:53:40,735 --> 01:53:42,065
Thank You, God.

829
01:53:42,735 --> 01:53:45,702
Let's go.

830
01:53:53,772 --> 01:53:55,704
Driver! Turn the car around!

831
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:12,901
This is Don Kihote's order! Stop it!

832
01:54:17,045 --> 01:54:18,636
What are you guys doing?!

833
01:54:18,879 --> 01:54:21,243
Stop it! This is the Don's order!

834
01:54:23,747 --> 01:54:28,010
lt was l who asked you to start
the riots! l now ask you to stop it!

835
01:54:28,749 --> 01:54:30,340
Stop it... Stop it, l say!

836
01:54:35,184 --> 01:54:38,015
What are you guys doing?! Stop it!

837
01:54:40,186 --> 01:54:43,017
l beg of you! Stop it!

838
01:54:43,753 --> 01:54:45,014
Stop it, l say!

839
01:54:47,087 --> 01:54:55,682
Don't burn me alive... Stop it!

840
01:54:56,324 --> 01:55:00,155
The amazing brains of Don Kihote!

841
01:55:04,326 --> 01:55:07,850
The amazing brains of Don Kihote!

842
01:56:36,286 --> 01:56:38,309
The Chief of Army Staff
wishes to see you, sir!

843
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:39,951
Later.

844
01:56:41,127 --> 01:56:43,389
He says it's important!

845
01:56:43,528 --> 01:56:45,392
lt's urgent matter, sir!
- Later.

846
01:56:59,466 --> 01:57:02,990
Riots have spread everywhere, sir!
- Later.

847
01:57:06,334 --> 01:57:08,994
Terrorists have spread panic...
- Later.

848
01:57:12,103 --> 01:57:13,034
Later!

849
01:57:14,503 --> 01:57:15,366
Later!

850
01:57:38,143 --> 01:57:40,372
We are doomed!
- Who allowed you in?

851
01:57:41,144 --> 01:57:43,077
You don't understand! Our game is up!

852
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:45,074
What do you mean?

853
01:57:45,412 --> 01:57:49,073
The Don was killed in the riots!
- So?

854
01:57:51,147 --> 01:57:53,409
So we're dead-meat
too! What are we to do?

855
01:57:55,582 --> 01:57:57,412
What would you have done?

856
01:57:58,149 --> 01:58:03,015
l'd have fled.
- That's the difference between us.

857
01:58:05,518 --> 01:58:07,417
You can't take advantage of a situation.

858
01:58:07,652 --> 01:58:10,347
What do you mean?
- l mean...

859
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:16,020
history will be made tonight.
- How?

860
01:58:17,122 --> 01:58:18,452
You won't understand.

861
01:58:19,122 --> 01:58:23,056
Because you're a small-time traitor.

862
01:58:23,690 --> 01:58:25,054
Traitor?!

863
01:58:25,558 --> 01:58:28,047
Do you know how a traitor is punished?

864
01:58:30,126 --> 01:58:31,353
With death!

865
01:58:35,561 --> 01:58:40,052
He wanted to kill me! The traitor!

866
01:59:16,773 --> 01:59:18,034
What happened?

867
02:00:15,222 --> 02:00:17,485
What is it?
- We have bad news.

868
02:00:18,223 --> 02:00:20,486
Your dad...
- What's with Dad?

869
02:00:20,757 --> 02:00:22,485
The Don is no more.

870
02:00:24,259 --> 02:00:25,555
He's dead.

871
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:28,522
He went looking for you.
And got killed in the riots.

872
02:00:31,595 --> 02:00:34,528
lt's true, Prince. Come and take a look.

873
02:00:55,268 --> 02:00:56,598
What the hell is this?

874
02:00:58,302 --> 02:00:59,563
Do you think l'm a fool?!

875
02:01:04,471 --> 02:01:07,562
You're kidding!
- No kidding. lt's the truth.

876
02:01:34,113 --> 02:01:37,773
Swine! Did you think you could
buy me out with all your gold?!

877
02:01:38,281 --> 02:01:40,611
Did you think l'd change my
mind with a change of clothes?

878
02:01:41,548 --> 02:01:45,777
l don't want your riches!
Just let me go! Leave me alone!

879
02:02:00,787 --> 02:02:02,719
lt happened because of you.

880
02:02:04,254 --> 02:02:09,711
Nobody can save you now. Not even me.

881
02:02:11,557 --> 02:02:12,614
Run...

882
02:02:13,725 --> 02:02:14,622
Run, l say!

883
02:02:18,258 --> 02:02:19,190
Run!

884
02:02:30,563 --> 02:02:33,530
Calm down! You're not the Don's
son anymore... You are ''The Don'' !

885
02:02:33,697 --> 02:02:35,492
lt's a tricky situation.

886
02:02:35,697 --> 02:02:38,186
That man we made
President is betraying us.

887
02:02:38,431 --> 02:02:40,625
lf we don't find a solution
soon, he'll finish us.

888
02:02:41,299 --> 02:02:43,232
We are the only ones
who know of his secret.

889
02:02:43,433 --> 02:02:45,228
We must act immediately.

890
02:02:46,734 --> 02:02:48,564
Kill him.

891
02:02:55,603 --> 02:02:57,502
This is my reward!

892
02:02:58,771 --> 02:03:03,171
We have very little time.
We must hurry. Go and change.

893
02:03:03,406 --> 02:03:05,497
You're the Don now. Not the son anymore.

894
02:03:07,674 --> 02:03:09,606
Don Kihote...?

895
02:03:11,274 --> 02:03:12,638
C'mon!

896
02:04:00,389 --> 02:04:01,287
Don't move!

897
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:03,720
Don't you move!

898
02:04:04,157 --> 02:04:05,521
Didn't you hear them?

899
02:04:08,258 --> 02:04:10,349
l'm not the son anymore...
l'm the Don himself!

900
02:04:12,292 --> 02:04:16,191
My own boss! l will do as l please!

901
02:04:16,661 --> 02:04:17,558
Never!

902
02:04:19,828 --> 02:04:21,691
Stupid girl!

903
02:04:22,429 --> 02:04:25,328
You're fortunate. The Don loves you.

904
02:04:26,764 --> 02:04:29,663
What are you worth anyway,
if it wasn't for my love?

905
02:04:35,832 --> 02:04:40,698
The duplicate hero! Your
death brings you here, eh?

906
02:04:41,434 --> 02:04:47,369
You real thug! l'd have
found you even in hell!

907
02:04:47,770 --> 02:04:51,362
Let her go. Or else...
- What will you do?

908
02:04:52,371 --> 02:04:53,394
Or you'll land in trouble.

909
02:04:53,738 --> 02:04:55,364
Listen, chapter!

910
02:04:55,605 --> 02:04:59,334
Those lines land you in
trouble. Not help you escape.

911
02:04:59,639 --> 02:05:04,335
A gun does not a brave man
make, you son-of-the-don!

912
02:05:04,541 --> 02:05:07,337
You don't scare me.

913
02:05:07,776 --> 02:05:11,334
Worm from the gutters!
You will really die today!

914
02:05:11,643 --> 02:05:14,667
Shoot, if you have the
guts! Here l am, before you!

915
02:05:17,745 --> 02:05:20,735
But don't miss the target, okay?

916
02:05:28,715 --> 02:05:31,910
l've run out of patience. And
you've run out of your time.

917
02:05:33,450 --> 02:05:34,711
This game is up!

918
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:27,761
Let him go!

919
02:08:38,737 --> 02:08:39,964
Want to be the hero, eh?

920
02:08:41,505 --> 02:08:42,766
The hero, eh?

921
02:08:44,539 --> 02:08:45,470
Playing the hero, are you?!

922
02:09:35,521 --> 02:09:37,453
Are you badly hurt?

923
02:09:38,521 --> 02:09:40,784
No. l was overacting.

924
02:09:51,558 --> 02:09:53,491
Do l look like the Don?
- No.

925
02:09:53,993 --> 02:09:57,448
No?
- You look like a real hero!

926
02:10:10,865 --> 02:10:12,922
We're late, Don.
- So let's go!

927
02:11:23,418 --> 02:11:27,511
Honorable Leaders of Countries
from across the World...

928
02:11:28,854 --> 02:11:33,844
and honorable delegates from the
international business community ...

929
02:11:35,656 --> 02:11:37,554
l welcome you all.

930
02:11:39,657 --> 02:11:47,558
You are here to help me solve the
financial problems of my country.

931
02:11:48,660 --> 02:11:50,990
But we don't want a loan...

932
02:11:51,994 --> 02:11:53,551
we're looking for ''buyers''.

933
02:11:54,761 --> 02:11:56,921
lt might surprise you...

934
02:11:58,596 --> 02:12:02,495
but in view of our economic,
sociological and political...

935
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:07,024
conditions in the country, l
have come to the conclusion...

936
02:12:07,965 --> 02:12:09,955
that we must sell lndia.

937
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:14,890
What's going on?
- lt's a dangerous game.

938
02:12:15,501 --> 02:12:17,967
History repeats itself, they say.

939
02:12:18,635 --> 02:12:20,898
And that repetition is called progress.

940
02:12:21,636 --> 02:12:26,570
You will remember that there
was a company, 15 years ago...

941
02:12:27,638 --> 02:12:29,571
that ruled this country.

942
02:12:29,772 --> 02:12:33,569
What profits the East lndia Company
made in lndia, is now history.

943
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:38,537
History is witness. Every man who
ruled this country, has made money.

944
02:12:38,674 --> 02:12:42,573
So one of you must make
money and make history, too.

945
02:12:53,679 --> 02:12:57,942
lndia will be auctioned here today!

946
02:13:05,348 --> 02:13:06,871
Everything in lndia is up for sale!

947
02:13:07,016 --> 02:13:09,881
lts people, its land,
its forests, its water...

948
02:13:10,651 --> 02:13:13,584
its arts and culture,
its science and society...

949
02:13:13,817 --> 02:13:15,875
everything will be sold
today! Legally. And over-board!

950
02:13:16,052 --> 02:13:18,917
The destiny of 85 million people
will lie in the hands of the man...

951
02:13:19,086 --> 02:13:21,314
who makes the highest bid!

952
02:13:21,654 --> 02:13:24,587
Here's your opportunity,
gentlemen! lt's going cheap!

953
02:13:24,788 --> 02:13:27,913
From Kashmir to Kanyakumari...
you can do anything with lndia!

954
02:13:28,088 --> 02:13:33,579
Hurry up, here's lndia... Buy lndia!

955
02:13:38,091 --> 02:13:42,582
The country has oil reserves.
And bails are easy to come by too.

956
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:48,959
There's Kashmir and TaJ
Mahal. And the Tihar Jail, too.

957
02:13:49,695 --> 02:13:53,594
This is a cheap Joke. By sick people.

958
02:13:53,996 --> 02:13:58,293
But if there's money to be made
even in a Joke... where's the harm?

959
02:13:58,898 --> 02:14:04,560
The country is selling
itself! Who can save it now?

960
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:08,561
They are the ones who first
devour the freedom they have won.

961
02:14:08,768 --> 02:14:10,825
And later sell the country.

962
02:14:11,468 --> 02:14:16,561
Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Delhi...

963
02:14:20,671 --> 02:14:22,934
they're all up for sale!

964
02:14:23,805 --> 02:14:26,931
And now, let's start bidding.

965
02:14:27,673 --> 02:14:30,606
Come forth gentlemen... and buy lndian.

966
02:14:33,942 --> 02:14:35,203
This country's going to be mine!

967
02:14:36,809 --> 02:14:41,936
Games of exploring oil are
over. The sale starts now!

968
02:14:42,678 --> 02:14:44,610
All the best. Get cracking.

969
02:14:45,011 --> 02:14:45,942
One billion.

970
02:14:47,412 --> 02:14:48,379
One billion...

971
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:51,646
Two billion.

972
02:14:52,147 --> 02:14:52,942
Two billion?

02:15:02,650 --> 02:15:04,912
They're selling each lndian
at Just Rupees 66.49 paise!

977
02:15:06,084 --> 02:15:07,015
Seven billion.

02:15:09,652 --> 02:15:10,879
8.25 billion.

979
02:15:11,385 --> 02:15:13,818

980
02:15:14,086 --> 02:15:15,575
12 billion.

02:15:15,987 --> 02:15:18,453
16 billion.

982
02:15:18,688 --> 02:15:21,587

25 billion.

985
02:15:24,723 --> 02:15:25,586
27 billion.

986
02:15:26,123 --> 02:15:27,054

987
02:15:27,424 --> 02:15:29,357

988
02:15:29,657 --> 02:15:30,988
35 billion.

989
02:15:31,425 --> 02:15:33,688
41 billion.

02:15:34,726 --> 02:15:37,625
5 billion.

991
02:15:37,994 --> 02:15:38,925

992
02:15:39,161 --> 02:15:40,058

994
02:15:43,195 --> 02:15:44,491

02:15:52,098 --> 02:15:54,121
What can l do?!

999
02:15:54,932 --> 02:15:56,262
The first call... 85 billion!

1000
02:16:00,901 --> 02:16:02,060
The second call... 85 billion!

1001
02:16:09,903 --> 02:16:12,802
One million... l mean, one trillion!

1002
02:16:15,271 --> 02:16:18,670
One ... trillion?!

1003
02:16:20,906 --> 02:16:22,236
Two trillion.

1004
02:16:24,908 --> 02:16:25,805
Three trillion!

1005
02:16:26,175 --> 02:16:27,106
Three trillion!

1006
02:16:27,608 --> 02:16:28,835

2 trillion?

1023
02:17:28,226 --> 02:17:32,387
Young pisser! Trying to outbid me?!

1024
02:17:32,994 --> 02:17:34,051
Who's the crazy chap?

1025
02:17:38,129 --> 02:17:39,459

1026
02:17:45,997 --> 02:17:47,463
This chap is crazy!

1027
02:17:48,298 --> 02:17:51,424
He's gone mad! Throw him out!

1028
02:17:52,166 --> 02:17:53,826

02:17:55,401 --> 02:17:56,424

02:17:56,901 --> 02:17:58,299
We're losing lndia!

1 trillion!

1032
02:18:13,572 --> 02:18:15,402
A thousand trillion!

1033
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:19,603
That's what lndia is
worth! A thousand trillion!

1034
02:18:19,774 --> 02:18:21,569
lndia is sold at 1 trillion!

1035
02:18:21,674 --> 02:18:23,607
lt's sold for 1 trillion!

1036
02:18:45,548 --> 02:18:47,014
l've done nothing...

1037
02:18:47,616 --> 02:18:50,606
The amazing brains of Don Kihote!

1038
02:18:57,719 --> 02:19:01,243
What did you think? You'd ruin
our plans by killing my general?

1039
02:19:01,620 --> 02:19:05,576
You forget! All your
guards are in my pay!

1040
02:19:06,321 --> 02:19:07,582
l didn't think of anything...

1041
02:19:43,065 --> 02:19:44,997
lt's over!

1042
02:19:45,232 --> 02:19:47,722
Your histrionics... come to an end.

1043
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:50,662
The climax has Just
begun, bloody coconut!

1044
02:19:51,434 --> 02:19:52,661
Take him away!

1045
02:19:56,435 --> 02:19:59,334
Don't you even touch Miss lndia!

1046
02:19:59,837 --> 02:20:02,702
Where are you going? We're
are in love, aren't we?

1047
02:20:06,438 --> 02:20:10,701
l'll come back, you bald
head! l'm going to return!

1048
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:14,339
Hey bald head...

1049
02:20:19,442 --> 02:20:20,340
Who is it...

1050
02:20:21,443 --> 02:20:22,340
Who are you?

1051
02:20:25,811 --> 02:20:27,743
l'm being punished for my foolishness.

1052
02:20:27,878 --> 02:20:29,674
And what are you being punished for?

1053
02:20:29,879 --> 02:20:31,675
This is no punishment.
lt's a conspiracy.

1054
02:20:31,879 --> 02:20:33,675
lt's a conspiracy to
destroy this nation.

1055
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:35,403
And who are you?

1056
02:20:35,614 --> 02:20:38,103
l'm the President of this country.
- l see.

1057
02:20:39,482 --> 02:20:43,415
The President...?! Greetings, sir!

1058
02:20:45,484 --> 02:20:49,815
l'm sorry, but are you the real...
- ldiot! l'm the real one!

1059
02:20:51,486 --> 02:20:54,748
Could this... be yours?
- Yes!

1060
02:20:57,887 --> 02:21:00,353
You're amazing!

1061
02:21:00,855 --> 02:21:03,720
l couldn't see properly
without my glasses.

1062
02:21:03,856 --> 02:21:05,652
l can see everything now.

1063
02:21:06,723 --> 02:21:10,713
We must do something.
We must save lndia.

1064
02:21:20,894 --> 02:21:23,383
A shock!
- What's wrong?

1065
02:21:24,728 --> 02:21:27,388
Stop trembling and think of something.

1066
02:21:31,497 --> 02:21:35,760
l have an idea, sir. Could
you play-act a little?

1067
02:21:35,931 --> 02:21:37,761
Acting? No, not me!

1068
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:43,763
Well... what have l to do?

1069
02:21:48,502 --> 02:21:51,435
No... not me!
- You must, sir...

1070
02:21:51,636 --> 02:21:53,762
There's no other way, to save lndia.

1071
02:21:54,937 --> 02:21:57,768
Please, sir... try to act, sir.

1072
02:21:58,872 --> 02:22:02,703
That's it, sir... Your
face, make it tremble a bit.

1073
02:22:11,475 --> 02:22:17,740
Take a look, somebody!
Something's wrong with him!

1074
02:22:21,478 --> 02:22:24,411
Come and look! Save him, someone!

1075
02:22:25,479 --> 02:22:28,412
Come closer and look...
he's had a heart-attack!

1076
02:22:33,481 --> 02:22:38,848
Come in, you sinner! Take a look!

1077
02:22:40,518 --> 02:22:41,711
What's happened to him?

1078
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:49,451
Everything's okay.

1079
02:22:51,953 --> 02:22:53,442
What do you want?

1080
02:22:54,522 --> 02:22:57,455
Just what you are selling.

1081
02:22:58,456 --> 02:22:59,387
Begin.

1082
02:23:02,123 --> 02:23:03,384
Begin, l say!

1083
02:23:09,159 --> 02:23:16,720
We once again begin
the auction of lndia.

1084
02:23:18,529 --> 02:23:19,426
One.

1085
02:23:20,529 --> 02:23:23,428
One thousand trillion.

1086
02:23:26,531 --> 02:23:28,430
One Rupee.

1087
02:23:34,233 --> 02:23:36,165
Whoever wants to die...
can raise his hand.

1088
02:23:39,535 --> 02:23:40,796
No one?

1089
02:23:45,969 --> 02:23:47,435
There's no one!

1090
02:23:49,571 --> 02:23:51,833
The first call... One Rupee.

1091
02:23:54,238 --> 02:23:55,829
The second call... One Rupee.

1092
02:23:58,506 --> 02:24:00,666
And the last call... One Rupee.

1093
02:24:02,208 --> 02:24:03,538
The country now belongs to me!

1094
02:24:14,511 --> 02:24:17,444
lndia... for a Rupee!

1095
02:24:35,351 --> 02:24:37,146
The hero's here!

1096
02:24:37,351 --> 02:24:41,284
Here comes the hero!

1097
02:24:42,953 --> 02:24:45,216
How are you guys?
- All hell has broken loose.

1098
02:24:45,954 --> 02:24:47,215
Relax...

1099
02:24:48,288 --> 02:24:50,880
We're shattered, hero!
- Don't worry.

1100
02:24:51,288 --> 02:24:55,222
This gentleman here is the President.
- That's an interesting name.

1101
02:24:55,390 --> 02:24:58,618
That's not his name. He's
the President of lndia.

1102
02:24:58,924 --> 02:25:01,186
The President... Don't you understand?

1103
02:25:04,259 --> 02:25:09,193
Of course! He's the President!

1104
02:25:11,928 --> 02:25:13,189
l saw him on TV.

1105
02:25:13,928 --> 02:25:16,555
Perhaps you don't know.
lndia's in grave danger.

1106
02:25:17,063 --> 02:25:19,121
Miss lndia?! What's wrong with her?
- Let me explain.

1107
02:25:19,563 --> 02:25:23,190
There's a conspiracy against
us. But we must save lndia.

1108
02:25:23,931 --> 02:25:26,262
Save Miss lndia?
- Well, yes.

1109
02:25:26,966 --> 02:25:28,193
We must save Miss lndia!

1110
02:25:33,101 --> 02:25:35,533
Come along... let's go.

1111
02:25:44,905 --> 02:25:46,894
Attention... everyone!

1112
02:25:48,239 --> 02:25:51,900
Bow to the new Emperor of lndia.

1113
02:25:52,974 --> 02:25:54,304
Bow to me!

1114
02:26:03,943 --> 02:26:05,136
l like that!

1115
02:26:09,945 --> 02:26:11,877
The Emperor wants his Crown!

1116
02:26:19,281 --> 02:26:21,873
Things have gone haywire.

1117
02:26:30,252 --> 02:26:33,218
l've had my Crown. l have this country.

1118
02:26:33,986 --> 02:26:36,214
l now want my Queen.

1119
02:26:39,988 --> 02:26:40,919
No!

1120
02:26:41,988 --> 02:26:45,251
Everything belongs to
me... in the legal sense!

1121
02:26:45,623 --> 02:26:49,249
The nation, its people and
its lands and resources!

1122
02:26:51,991 --> 02:26:53,252
So?
- No!

1123
02:26:55,992 --> 02:26:59,187
l give you once last chance.
l'll make you my Queen.

1124
02:26:59,927 --> 02:27:01,859
Or else, l'll destroy you!

1125
02:27:20,299 --> 02:27:22,061
l will punish you now...

1126
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:24,061
like no one has ever
been punished before!

1127
02:28:33,021 --> 02:28:36,283
Help me, someone! Stop this man!

1128
02:28:37,022 --> 02:28:38,545
Stop him, someone!

1129
02:28:39,622 --> 02:28:41,282
Help!

1130
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:38,562
Leave Miss lndia alone!

1131
02:31:02,731 --> 02:31:03,662
No!

1132
02:31:28,472 --> 02:31:30,371
What happens to you now?

1133
02:31:43,176 --> 02:31:44,699
Long live!

1134
02:31:52,179 --> 02:31:53,770
Traitors!

1135
02:34:00,417 --> 02:34:03,406
Let me go... l was only a
puppet in the Don's hands!

1136
02:34:04,151 --> 02:34:06,084
lt's time for you to depart!

1137
02:34:38,361 --> 02:34:39,725
Traitor!

1138
02:34:41,862 --> 02:34:43,123
You tried to sell the nation!

1139
02:34:43,496 --> 02:34:45,395
l've done nothing... let me go!

1140
02:34:46,463 --> 02:34:54,126
Please! Leave me alone...
... Mr. President!

1141
02:35:03,402 --> 02:35:04,425
Hold it...

1142
02:35:05,169 --> 02:35:07,101
You tried to sell lndia?!

1143
02:35:09,170 --> 02:35:10,101
Give that to me...

1144
02:35:15,039 --> 02:35:17,801
Drink it... Go on!

1145
02:35:19,739 --> 02:35:22,104
No! Don't kill him... Stop it!

1146
02:35:25,941 --> 02:35:35,707
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two one...

1147
02:36:05,619 --> 02:36:07,085
Let's go.

1148
02:37:46,916 --> 02:37:50,145
l won't let him go!

1149
02:38:16,658 --> 02:38:18,886
She's mine!

1150
02:39:37,716 --> 02:39:39,614
We've made it, Miss lndia!

1151
02:39:40,716 --> 02:39:44,616
He whom the Lord
protects, no one can kill!

1152
02:39:48,285 --> 02:39:52,184
Why are you quiet? What's wrong?

1153
02:39:53,020 --> 02:39:55,350
You're asking me?
- Sure... why not?

1154
02:39:56,754 --> 02:39:59,653
You're... suffering from Cancer.

1155
02:40:00,755 --> 02:40:04,654
Yes. The doctor said l have
only six months to live.

1156
02:40:05,757 --> 02:40:08,656
But that happened a year and a half ago.

1157
02:40:10,758 --> 02:40:13,247
Really?
- Of course!

1158
02:40:21,761 --> 02:40:23,250
How did that happen?

1159
02:40:23,762 --> 02:40:27,695
O darling, this is... lndia!
