00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:07,875
(Koambai-Tamilnadu: Early morning 4 AM)

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Hey Rangu!

4
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:11,833
Hey!

5
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,000
Time to get up, Rangu.

6
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,958
Hey Rangu!

7
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,292
Get up, Rangu.

8
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,458
Rangu!

9
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,833
Get up.

10
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,417
Why did you leave the
firewood to get drenched?

11
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,750
Why are you dragging
my kins into it?

12
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,125
I have lots of work to take care.

13
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:28,375
Don't exaggerate.
You keep on blabbering.

14
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,292
Don't talk nonsense.

15
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,167
You are enjoying the
fruits of my labor. - Stop it.

16
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,625
I'll thrash you bad.

17
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:36,792
I'm easily get provoked.

18
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,417
I too do can get provoked.

19
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,750
Do you think I'm just
killing the time?

20
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,542
Keep quiet!

21
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:43,833
I do work hard.

22
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:45,875
Make it fast.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,083
Stop it.
- Have some patience.

24
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,042
Get me a tea!
- Give me a moment.

25
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,917
What do you mean?

26
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,333
I'll definitely clear the credit.

27
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,792
I did promise to clear
the debt at the earliest.

28
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,458
Why do you raise your tone when
you are yet to clear your debt?

29
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:03,250
I'll clear it by the end of the day.

30
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
To hell with your stall!

31
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,500
Tea please..
- Take it easy..

32
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:13,083
Get me a tea. - I should rather to
gone to any other stall.

33
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,583
Have some patience.

34
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,958
No one stopped you.

35
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:18,833
Ignore him.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,542
I'll clear the debts by 12 PM
or by the end of the day.

37
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,792
I have made my words clear.

38
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,208
Hell of a tea stall.

39
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,667
Don't go to his stall.

40
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:30,125
It's nothing but plain water.
- Why the hell did you take the credit?

41
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,292
Settle the account and raise your voice.

42
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,292
Mom, don't keep
repeating the same.

43
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,792
What did I say?

44
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,000
You have to come tomorrow.
I'm registering the land in your name.

45
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,042
Why will I need it?

46
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,750
Not necessary.

47
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,042
I'll be back after a trip.

48
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,250
I have to take care of the formalities.

49
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,125
Our money that Bhakkiyam
has safe guarded..

50
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:53,875
I'll get the money from her

51
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,167
and will hand over to Veeranan.

52
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:58,917
Make sure you get draped
in the best saree.

53
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,125
Let's register it in your name.
- Listen to me.

54
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,167
Register it in your name.
Why will I need it?

55
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,167
I have decided it.
Don't drag the conversation.

56
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:20,417
Bye, mom.

57
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,833
Take care.

58
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,625
Pannaipuram.

59
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,750
Accountant.

60
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,500
Accountant.
- Come.

61
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,792
Boss.

62
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,625
Safeguard the receipts.

63
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,708
Greetings.
- Greetings.

64
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,292
Take this.

65
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,167
Rangu.
- Yes.

66
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,625
This is a very important letter.

67
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,458
Make sure you personally handover
this to Meeraatha in Vattaparai.

68
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,667
Okay.

69
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,958
Make sure that you
bring the ledger. - Okay.

70
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,250
Accountant.

71
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,792
I'll be back by a trip.
- Why?

72
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,333
For land registration. - I'll take care of it.
You are not required for it.

73
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,750
Thevaram- Shopping street.

74
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,167
Oppari (death ritual folk song)

75
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,083
I have passed the information.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,875
My brother would have
hired a car to leave.

77
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,042
Get me kesari (dessert).

78
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,125
Kethara is sleeping over there.

79
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:02,958
Why is a podium erected?

80
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,792
Ramayya's mother passed away.

81
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,667
A tea for me.

82
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,958
Which path are you taking today?
- Saakaloothu Mettu.

83
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:16,958
Bro!

84
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,875
Why don't you rest at one place?

85
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,292
I'm tired of searching you.

86
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,292
I went for the last show (Cinema).

87
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,167
I slept here as it
started to rain.

88
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,625
Have this kesari (dessert).

89
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,333
2 teas.

90
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,792
Shall I borrow this bench?

91
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,208
You need not seek my permission.

92
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,000
Rangu.. give me a hand.

93
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,708
Haven't prepared the lights?

94
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:54,417
Do I need to pass the death news.
- I have already passed it.

95
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,542
They must have started.

96
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,083
Uncle.

97
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,708
Why are you hitting them?
- They aren't obliging me.

98
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,042
What do you mean?
- They aren't obeying me.

99
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,708
Move.

100
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,667
Isn't you land registration tomorrow?

101
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,917
Yes.

102
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,333
Is it Veeranan land in
Kariyanampatti foothills?

103
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,458
Yes.

104
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:28,917
It's a rocky terrain.

105
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,292
You need not worry.

106
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,667
We can clear it.

107
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:32,667
Okay.

108
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,750
We are lucky enough
to get this business.

109
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:40,083
Your parents have slogged
very badly to buy a piece of land.

110
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,458
But your father
isn't lucky enough.

111
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:48,250
You want to buy a land before
your mother passes away.

112
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:53,250
Why don't you follow the path?

113
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,292
Why are you whamming them?

114
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,250
Are you insane?

115
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,833
For the urgency of the bosses

116
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,667
you started to carry the load.

117
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,333
Since then the donkey's
were discarded off.

118
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,583
Why do you turn your
anger towards them?

119
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,167
Despite knowing that it's fatal

120
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,333
they are carrying the load.

121
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:08,708
We can't help them.

122
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,000
These donkeys are refraining
from their regular work.

123
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,542
They are used only once
or twice in this way.

124
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,500
They are helpless.

125
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,833
It's my mistake to wham them.

126
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,792
Move..

127
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,042
Are you trying to appease
after whacking hard?

128
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,542
Why do you hurt innocent creatures?

129
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,083
Is it the only way to
reach Kerala by walk?

130
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:35,333
There are many ways.

131
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,500
There is one route on this
side and one via Saakaloothu.

132
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,125
A path via Pathinettaam Padi.

133
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,708
There are many such ways.

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,375
This is Kuthirai Paanjaan.

135
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,958
This path is enroute
to Sathurangaparai..

136
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,125
Manathodu..

137
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,250
Thalayankaval..

138
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,458
Namari..

139
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,958
Uduppan Solai.

140
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,167
You can reach all these villages
in Kerala enroute this way.

141
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:59,458
Men have come,
you can join them.

142
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,458
These guys?
- Yes.

143
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,292
Grandma.
- What have you brought for me?

144
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:09,917
Lachumi, get me a coffee.

145
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,292
Sister Bhakkiyam..

146
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,042
Why are you grinding
the batter so late?

147
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:23,625
Elephant intrusion.

148
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,750
We just chased them away
which delayed my chores.

149
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,333
The elephant was
creating a ruckus

150
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,417
I have been working all night.

151
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,708
Who is this guy?

152
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,417
He is my kin.

153
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,000
He is from Nilakottai.

154
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,583
He needs to invite people in
Manathoadu for his family function.

155
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,750
He is scared of elephants.

156
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,417
Are you scared of elephants?

157
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,917
Why are you bothered about it?

158
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,375
Actually..

159
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,625
If we mind our business,
they will mind theirs.

160
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,250
In a worst case..

161
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,708
They will not harm
us if pleaded.

162
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,417
Are you sure of it?
- Yes. - Fine then.

163
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:02,458
(Insane lady shouting)

164
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,042
Has the insane lady gone there?

165
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,625
I tried stopping her.
But she seldom listens.

166
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,625
Let's start.
- Increase the flame.

167
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,917
Too much of smoke.
- Okay, grandma.

168
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,292
Come on.

169
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,833
Bye.

170
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,292
Good bye.

171
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,625
Take care.

172
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,375
Rangu.. Drop him in Manathoadu.

173
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,583
Okay.

174
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,750
Elephants won't attack us.

175
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:35,792
Uncle.

176
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,750
I'm used to living in the plains.

177
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,542
These paths are new to me.
So, I'm slightly scared.

178
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,625
We too travel via the same route.
Don't worry.

179
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,500
Our lives are equally worth.

180
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,625
It's my maiden trip.

181
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,792
I'm not used to this path.

182
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,208
Elephants are harmless creatures.

183
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:55,500
Have elephants ever
come to our territory?

184
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,125
Indeed we are crossing their path.
THEVAARAM (FOOT HILLS)

185
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,125
Why blame them?

186
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,792
Elephants always follow
a certain pathway.

187
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:09,500
We cross their path
and blame them.

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,750
They are very unlike us.

189
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,792
Do they often change
the paths like humans?

190
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,667
I agree.

191
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:24,083
'Western Ghats'

192
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,208
'Western Ghats'

193
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,500
Take him safely.

194
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,000
Bye.
- Okay.

195
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,000
Bye.

196
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,208
Uncle.

197
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,125
Uncle.

198
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,833
That route isn't very smooth.
Shall I assist you ?

199
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,542
Not neccessary.

200
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,458
I'm quite sure of the path.
Get lost.

201
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,125
I can travel safe
even if I'm blinded.

202
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,458
You are guiding me?

203
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,167
Reach safe.

204
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,583
Make sure that you reach safely.

205
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,417
Fold your dress.

206
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,042
Come on, come on.

207
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,958
Come on.
- Where does the path lead to?

208
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,750
That path too joins at hill top

209
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,208
That's the path for donkeys.
It's little farther.

210
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:13,500
Yes brother.
- As the guy mentioned..

211
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,875
If we stick to our path

212
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,250
Elephant's won't harm us, right?
- Yes.

213
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,667
Elephants?

214
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,583
They are harmless.

215
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,167
But a raging elephant

216
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,875
can launch a fatal attack.

217
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,708
Why are you scaring
the feared man?

218
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,875
You move ahead.

219
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,875
Rangu I can't match your pace.

220
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,875
Take your time.
I'll go ahead.

221
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,167
Okay.
- Be careful.

222
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,250
Excuse me.

223
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:40,542
Let's move on.

224
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,208
Wait.

225
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,250
If you take breaks
we can't reach on time.

226
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,542
Let's gather speed.

227
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,708
Come on.

228
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,625
Put this stone in your pocket.

229
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,875
Why?

230
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,875
I'll explain it later.

231
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,417
Come on.

232
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,375
Brother.
- Yes.

233
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,583
Why do you suffer so much?

234
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,708
Can't you get a job in the foot hills?

235
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,875
There are no jobs down there.

236
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,458
We can cultivate crops
provided we own a land.

237
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,125
I don't have that luxury.

238
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,542
My father used to transport
goods to Cardamom estates using donkeys.

239
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,625
I'm carrying on the lineage now.

240
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:28,125
I'll kill all the elephants.
(Insane lady)

241
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,583
I'll kill all the elephants.

242
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,875
I'll kill all the elephants.

243
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,250
I'll kill all the elephants.

244
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,750
I'll kill all the elephants.

245
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,208
I'll kill all the elephants.
- What are you doing?

246
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,875
I'll kill all the elephants.

247
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,292
Your money is being looted over there.
Scoot now.

248
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,042
Move fast.

249
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:49,417
I'll slay.

250
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,667
I'll stab you to death.

251
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,917
I'll stab you to death.
Get lost morons.

252
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,083
I'll slay.

253
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,125
I'll slay.

254
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:55,167
I'll stab.

255
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,250
Give me my money.

256
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
I'll kill you.

257
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,833
Dare not to touch my money.
- Brother.

258
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:04,250
Why is the woman shouting this way?

259
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:09,000
The lady and her husband
were working in the estate.

260
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,583
She had a daughter.

261
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,958
They wanted to get her married.

262
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:19,625
They were traveling with
their life time earnings

263
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,833
towards the foothills..

264
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:24,042
They were chased by an elephant.

265
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,292
It killed her husband.

266
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,458
Her husband died in her presence.

267
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,917
The money in her hands
scattered everywhere.

268
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,583
She lost her senses from then.

269
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,542
Since then..

270
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:43,917
She has been wandering
like this

271
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,750
Her relatives got her daughter married.

272
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:58,125
Her daughter gets her dress and
bangles on special occasions.

273
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,917
She only takes the bangles.

274
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,625
But I'm not sure of
the elephants' mind

275
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,500
They spare this lady.

276
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:13,458
We have come closer.
- Wait.

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,417
We shall reach in 5 minutes.

278
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,667
How can you trek via
this uphill everyday?

279
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,917
Its our only option of survival.

280
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,250
Come on.

281
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
We shall sit near Satha.

282
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,292
Excuse me!
- Yes.

283
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,625
Can we get water here?

284
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,000
No. There is no water here.

285
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,375
We can get it in the hill top.

286
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,083
In the hill top?
- Yes.

287
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:45,958
How farther is that?

288
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,542
That is Satha.

289
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,083
And if we cross one more
steep we can reach top hill.

290
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:55,625
How much distance
have we covered?

291
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,708
One fourth.

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,625
This 'Satha Medu' and
we are one steep away.

293
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,958
Shall we relax for a while?

294
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,208
We can't reach on time
if we take breaks.

295
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:09,917
We can reach sooner if
make a breakless journey.

296
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,708
Seems you will make this
final journey for ever.

297
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:13,875
Let's move, bro!

298
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,458
Your relatives were
waiting for you.

299
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,125
My relatives?
- Yes.

300
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,667
My relatives wouldn't
have come here.

301
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,542
4 elephants were awaiting you.

302
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,833
You are lucky.
They moved just now.

303
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:00,833
Not just 4 even if 400 elephants come

304
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,917
can't stop me from taking rest.

305
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,375
Why don't you stay quiet?

306
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,167
Take that stone.

307
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,083
Which stone?
- The one we took down there.

308
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,083
Yes.
- That one.

309
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,375
Why do you need it?
- I'll explain.

310
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,292
What are you upto?
- Come here.

311
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,083
Remove your sandals.

312
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,750
Come here.

313
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,000
Keep the stone here.

314
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Come on.

315
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,500
Pray God and then throw it.

316
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,500
Why are the stone heaped over here?

317
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,667
This is Satha.

318
00:18:58,042 --> 00:18:59,750
God for trekkers.

319
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,083
Okay.

320
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,542
Sit down.

321
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:06,667
People who travel for
the first time..

322
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:10,417
People with ailments..

323
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,667
They take a stone with them.

324
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,667
'I'll carry your burden.'

325
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,542
'You carry mine'.

326
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,833
They pray to God and
keep the stones here.

327
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:24,583
They go to the peak and thank
the God by performing rituals.

328
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,667
This is the history
of this custom.

329
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,375
Also porters like us..

330
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,583
Travel alone..

331
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:34,708
No one will be available
to lift the sacks.

332
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:38,708
So we use this heap as
a leverage to lift it.

333
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,667
May be this is reason
behind this custom.

334
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,208
Whatever might be the reason,
this Satha is our God.

335
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,542
Mr.Marimuthu.
- Yes, Rangu.

336
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,333
Are you at Satha?
- Yes.

337
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,875
If you meet my wife..

338
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,792
My trip was successful.

339
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,833
Tell her that I'm on my way.
- Okay.

340
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:02,250
You leave..
As they are coming this way

341
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,833
I will join them..
- It's okay.

342
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,000
I interrupted your job as well.

343
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:08,167
You go ahead.

344
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,667
It's not a problem.
- Listen.

345
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,708
You start.
- Okay.

346
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,042
It's just an uphill.
I will manage

347
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,375
Take care.

348
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:16,792
Bye.

349
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,625
Marimuthu brother.
- Yes.

350
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,917
He is Bhakkiyam's relative who
came to invite his kins.

351
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,250
Yes, she informed.

352
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,875
Guide him to hill top.

353
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:25,583
I'll take care.

354
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,708
You don't forget to pass the information.
- Okay.

355
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:30,958
Be careful.
- Okay.

356
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,542
Bye.

357
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Hey.

358
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,917
Wait a second.
- Yes.

359
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:41,042
I forgot to invite.

360
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,167
I forgot in this tiresome journey.

361
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,667
Don't feel bad, as I'm
inviting in an informal way.

362
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,000
You both come.
- Okay.

363
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,750
Will you?
- I'll definitely come.

364
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:56,583
I'll join them.
- Okay.

00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:57,667
Bye.

Kuthirai Paanjaan Mettu.

368
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,792
Song playing in Ceylon radio.

369
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,417
Sir.
- Why are you late, today?

370
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,667
Bhakkiyam's relative had
come to invite his kins.

371
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,875
Where is he?

372
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:27,875
He is staying near Satha Medu.

373
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,667
I have asked Marimuthu to guide him.

374
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,292
I have brought sugar.

375
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,167
Keep it inside and take money
from the drawer.- Okay.

376
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,667
♪♫♪♫♪♫♪♫♪♫

377
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
I'll prepare a coffee.

378
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:13,667
Sadhurangapaarai
Idukki district- Kerala.

379
00:22:58,417 --> 00:22:59,917
Mrs. Maarimuthu, your husband is on the way.

380
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,042
Did he pass any message?

381
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,042
He promised to get your
daughter married to me.

382
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,417
He is a crazy guy.
You tell me.

383
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,625
His travel turned out to be fruitful.

384
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:06,792
He would have crossed hill top.

385
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,667
Wait! Let me get a black coffee.

386
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,417
I'll leave.
I'm running out of time.

387
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,250
We have lots of work ahead.

388
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,917
Don't kill our time.

389
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:15,667
You enjoy your coffee.

390
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,667
You have brought me a good news.

391
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,750
Have this sweet.

392
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:20,875
Here.

393
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,792
I won't have it till I get
married to your daughter.

394
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,875
Hey Latchumi.

395
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:27,792
Where are you?

396
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:30,167
My husband is on the way.

397
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:34,542
Has everyone arrived?

398
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,875
Who worked in the 8 acres?

399
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,042
It's us.
- You?

400
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,792
Why, comrade?
- Greetings, comrade.

401
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Bye, Rangu.

402
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:46,417
I received a complaint that
cardamom plants have been damaged.

403
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,042
Don't do anything like that.

404
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,875
You must work hard.. only
then we can get the work.

405
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:54,417
You do know that how hard is
it to get work for the labor union?

406
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,625
You go to the 8 acres.

407
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,167
You are..
- 5 men.

408
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:02,167
5 men, right?
Go to SR estate.

409
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:03,917
How many men are there?
- Seven.

410
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:05,917
Seven men..

411
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,000
Nayar Estate.
- Thank you..

412
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:10,542
We don't have work since 2 days.
What shall we do?(Speaking in Malayalam)

413
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,167
How many are there?
Three, right?

414
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,875
They are group of 5 to 6.

415
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:16,292
They have no work since 2 days..
So...

416
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:18,917
You may leave.
I'll take care.

417
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:24,250
Couldn't you be more careful?

418
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:25,792
I'm going to Vattaparai.
It will take time for me to return.

419
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay, Rangu.
- Stay close to store room.

420
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,875
Got it.
- Don't make me search for you.

421
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,792
Ask the porters to stay here.

422
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Got it?
Bye.

423
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:35,250
Are you feeling better now?

424
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:36,875
What if you had injured your hand?

425
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:46,167
{\an3}Muruga!
- Comrade Chaako, a moment please.

426
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,167
{\an3}Here is the union fund.

427
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:27,042
{\an3}Ask those who haven't paid to expedite.
Okay.

428
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,375
{\an3}Take leave.
- Okay

429
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,375
{\an3}Bye.

430
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:39,417
Cardamom Plantation.

431
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,167
Pazhaniyamma.

432
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,167
Why didn't you come
to the conference?

433
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,167
I wasn't feeling well.

434
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,792
Make sure that you are present
for the next one. - Sure.

435
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,375
How are you?

436
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,667
Fine.

437
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:00,917
Carry on.

438
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,375
There is a giant
leech in the forest.

439
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,125
It will suck blood out of you.

440
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:07,375
Hey, come again.

441
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,792
Mind your language.
- A leech doesn't deserve it.

442
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,667
I'll teach you a lesson.

443
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:13,917
Let see.

444
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:16,417
Rangu!
- Comrade.

445
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:18,417
It's the medicine for dad.

446
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,042
Take it to home.
- Okay.

447
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,000
See you, comrade.

448
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,542
Rangu!

449
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,042
Convey my regards to Meeraatha.
- Okay.

450
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
'Thalayankaval'

451
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,500
Their parents are to be blamed.

452
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,917
3 cardamoms..300 jasmines..

453
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:03,042
Riterate it to your parents.

454
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:04,875
Why do you torment me?

455
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,042
Move.

456
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,500
Move away.
- If I catch hold of you...

457
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,500
Scoot!!

458
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,625
Get lost!

459
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,000
If I catch hold of you...

460
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:16,542
Assume you are dead.

461
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,667
I'll rip your skin.

462
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:19,667
Supervisor.

463
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,042
Shame on their parenting.

464
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:22,625
Darn!

465
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,542
Forget it.
- They do it all the time.

466
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,375
Move on.

467
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:27,792
I'll thrash them.

468
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:29,417
Move on.

469
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,125
This has become a routine.

470
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,167
Like father like son.

471
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,917
Useless fellows.. - Forget it.
- Did boss give money?

472
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:39,375
Yes..
- I have to tackle round the year.

473
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,667
A hell of a life.

474
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:42,792
Child games.

475
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:43,875
Worst parenting.

476
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:47,542
Get me the receipt.

477
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,542
Message from boss?

478
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:11,500
He asked me to get the ledger.

479
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:15,542
Cardamoms have to be plucked.

480
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,792
Union problems.

481
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,792
Boss has asked to finish
it with our men.

482
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:22,667
Let's manage.

483
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:25,292
Any message?

484
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:26,917
Yes.

485
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,667
Order some manure in
Aathukaadu estate.

486
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,792
I have to deliver a letter
to Meeratha in Vattapaarai.

487
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:34,667
Is it?

488
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:36,042
Okay, I'll get it
done by someone.

489
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,292
Okay.

490
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,917
Tomorrow is the land registration, isn't it?
- Yes.

491
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,917
Document it properly.
- Okay.

492
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Okay.

493
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,125
Take that bag.

494
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:46,792
Keep the ledger in it.

495
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:02,792
Will you get me my money or not?

496
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:06,292
What's it?
- Does it make any sense?

497
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:08,042
Collect my money from her.

498
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:11,792
How many times should I remind?
- I keep reminding her.

499
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,167
Won't I deliver it if given?
- Why aren't you stern about it?

500
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,917
It's hard earned money.

501
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,167
It my blood and sweat.

502
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,625
It's the fruit of my hard labor.

503
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,167
Okay, I'll get it.

504
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:26,917
Tell me my name.

505
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,167
You are torturing me.

506
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,792
A woman can't call
her husband's name.

507
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:32,792
I have tattooed it.
(R. Rangasamy)

508
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,167
Examine it properly.
(R. Rangasamy)

509
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:37,375
Okay, I'll pass the message.
- Don't fail.

510
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:40,417
She is enjoying the
fruit of my labor.

511
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,167
She never mends her ways.

512
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,417
Hi, madam.
- Come, Rangasamy.

513
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,042
How are you?
- Fine.

514
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,917
Great.
- Is mom doing well?

515
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,292
She is good.

516
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,375
She had joint pains.

517
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:58,292
I have got her medicinal
oil and she is using it. - Okay.

518
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,500
I met Chaako on the way.

519
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,042
He asked me to pass this medicine.

520
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:04,667
How are you?

521
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:07,542
Normal as ever.
- How's your health.

522
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:10,750
You met my son.
- yes.

523
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,417
How is he?
- Good.

524
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:15,625
It has been 20 days
since I last saw my son - Ok.

525
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,667
I asked him to get married
which he denied as well.

526
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:21,292
Even I struggling with ailments.

527
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:25,000
He is always engaged with
his political commitments.

528
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:29,167
This will lead him no where.

529
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:31,500
Say this when you meet him.

530
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:34,292
'You dad is not feeling well...

531
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,042
and wants to meet you'

532
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,167
Okay. You don't worry.
Take care of your health.

533
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:42,417
Take this tapioca to home.
- No, it's okay.

534
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:43,542
Take this.

535
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,667
Convey my regards to your mom.

536
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,042
See you.
- Take this.

537
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:51,917
Bye.
- Take care.

538
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:57,917
You discuss about our
son with every visitor.

539
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,292
His mind is filled up only
with party commitments.

540
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:03,625
Let the destiny take its path.

541
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,542
Rangasamy..
I saw Meeratha in Upparval.

542
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm going to visit him.

543
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,917
Is it? - I delivered
the medicine to dad.

544
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:25,125
Then dad had would have
narrated many stories.

545
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,875
My dad wants me to get married
and lead a normal life.

546
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,417
That's not possible.
- Who will do this job?

547
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,667
My dad always laments.
- Bye, Chaako.

548
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:12,875
Take this.

549
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,167
Take both of these.

550
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,500
Mani bro, have you taken everything?

551
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,250
Take them to the vehicle.

552
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,042
Have it.

553
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,917
Ramakrishnan wanted some saplings.

554
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,667
Ask him to visit tomorrow.
- Definitely.

555
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,375
Greetings.
- Hi, Rangasamy.

556
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,917
What's the purpose of visit?
- To meet you.

557
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,292
Boss has passed a message.

558
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,625
I went to the store to meet you.

559
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,500
Your daughter told me that you had
come to buy the saplings.

560
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,542
Why did you travel so long?

561
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:45,792
You should have passed
it through my daughter.

562
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:48,417
He insisted that I have to deliver
in person as it's very important.

563
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,750
He will order from foothills.

564
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:52,792
He will pass the order.

565
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:56,292
only those who pass through this passage
will know about its difficulties.

566
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,167
Why did you travel so long?

567
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:00,500
Where are you going?
- Sadhurangaparai.

568
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,250
I'll drop you in the jeep.

569
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:03,667
I'll go via Kaathoodhi medu.

570
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,375
I'll drop you in the jeep.

571
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:14,125
Did your boss pass
any message? - No.

572
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,750
Is the registration tomorrow?

573
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,750
Yes.

574
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,542
Do ask me for any financial
assistance if needed.

575
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:23,542
Don't be hesitant like your father.

576
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,292
The rate is less as it's
closer to the foothills.

577
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,292
The money I have is sufficient.

578
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,167
Whose land?
- Veeranan's.

579
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,417
Veeranan's land in Kariyanampatti?
- Yes.

580
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,667
That stretch?
- Yes.

581
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:40,750
Don't step on the cardamoms.

582
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:44,667
Careful.

583
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,542
Weigh it precisely.

584
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:57,375
It's on the higher side.

585
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:01,167
How long will you
take to weigh these?

586
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:02,750
It's almost over.

587
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,417
Don't step on the cardamoms.
- Hurry up.

588
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:06,792
55

589
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,792
Almost over.
Here we come.

590
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,667
Speed up

591
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,917
Stitch it faster.

592
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:13,292
Why did you take so much time, Rangasamy?

593
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,375
I had gone to Vattapaarai
to visit Meeraatha.

594
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,375
He had gone to Upparval.

595
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:17,542
So, it took some time.

596
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:21,042
What are you doing inside?

597
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:24,250
Speed it up.

598
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,417
You are talking years to do it.
- It's almost over.

599
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,750
At my age I would have
delivered 4 trips by now.

600
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,750
And would be working on the fifth one.

601
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,750
Shameless guys.
- You always boast of your generation.

602
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,792
When you sum up all our loads
On donkeys and ourselves

603
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:41,667
that we carried at younger age

604
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,500
would equal the height of Western Ghats.

605
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,292
You know nothing.
- Don't talk rubbish.

606
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,792
My shoulders speak
volumes of my hard work.

607
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,417
Look at the indelible mark it has left.

608
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,500
It's not easy, moron.

609
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,542
Pass it on.
- Okay carry on.

610
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:58,417
You are too soft on it.

611
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,542
You can't even stitch properly.

612
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,542
Don't waste time.
Carry on.

613
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:04,750
Lift the sacks.

614
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:06,292
Come on.

615
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:07,542
Move..

616
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:08,667
Keep moving.

617
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:12,625
You are taking hours for this job.

618
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:15,292
Want to bet on my skill?

619
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:18,125
Shall we race to the foothills?

620
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,792
You can even start ahead of me.

621
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:23,417
I will start after 10 minutes.
- Let's see.

622
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:24,917
Let's see who reaches first.

623
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:26,542
Come on.

624
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:31,667
Speed up.

625
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:33,792
You keep moving.
I'll follow.

626
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:48,542
You started before dawn,
but you are reaching so late, Mookaiah?

627
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:50,750
You never quit on this donkey.

628
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,917
I would have finished four trips by now.

629
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:57,167
Tie these donkeys over
there and get me coffee, Kethara.

630
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:00,042
Your hard work has
made your body shrink.

631
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:01,917
Why?

632
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:02,917
Pass this coffee.

633
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,042
Had you carried yourself,
you would have on par with us.

634
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,250
You follow the footsteps of donkeys

635
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,667
And reach so late.

636
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,292
I and the donkeys have been
taking the same path since ages.

637
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,542
one among us have to die.

638
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:19,167
I will not stop till then.

639
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,625
You have grown old.

640
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:23,042
You are not able to withstand.

641
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:24,667
Ask my wife about my vigor.

642
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,292
Behave like a matured person.

643
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:29,667
Accept that you are too
old to lift, mongrel.

644
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:32,292
Try lifting it
- I'll.

645
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,292
Why can't he carry the load?

646
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:36,625
Let's go.
- Get lost, cuckold.

647
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,750
Come on.

648
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,667
Take care of the shop.
I'll be back. - Okay.

649
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,750
Mookaiah.

650
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,542
Look at the way I lift it.

651
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,625
Don't provoke me.

652
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,292
I'll hit you badly.

653
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:56,417
Am I surviving on your efforts?

654
00:36:57,167 --> 00:37:00,417
You sold the donkeys and now
you are carrying the load, dick head.

655
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,750
Get lost.
- I forgot the goose berries.

656
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,542
I have the vigor.
- It's getting late. Please give it.

657
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:06,750
Get lost.
- To hell with your shop.

658
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:08,542
Useless frail man.

659
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,542
Why do you provoke him?

660
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,542
Come on.

661
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:17,542
He doesn't listen to me.
He is still managing with the donkeys.

662
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:19,750
A man must have dignity.

663
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:21,750
Why can't he carry it?

664
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:23,750
He is over dependent on donkeys.

665
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:25,292
Yes.

666
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:28,750
You talk as if they carry the mountain.
Come on.

667
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,542
What's your problem?

668
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,667
We have carried tonnes through this path.

669
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:40,667
We were once hit by a heavy monsoon.

670
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:43,750
It was torrential rains

671
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:47,542
All animals were in hibernation.

672
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:52,417
All the access routes were damaged.

673
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:57,542
One of my bosses had
financial trouble

674
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:00,750
He asked me to carry a sack of
cardamom to the foot hills.

675
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:04,542
No one from the village was ready.

676
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,667
I pitied him and offered to help.

677
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:13,292
Some discouraged me.

678
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:17,542
How can I refuse when someone is so helpless.

679
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,750
You have asked me a favour.

680
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,167
It's my responsibility to deliver it.

681
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,792
I started walking
off with the load.

682
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:30,292
Clouds were as dark as honey comb.

683
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,750
All the paths leading
to the foothills.

684
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:35,542
... were vanishing

685
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,750
The dark clouds were intimidating.

686
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:43,792
I totally trusted our forefather
deity and started walking.

687
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:48,000
Like a vulture landing
to grasp a chicken.

688
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,292
I dropped it in go down.

689
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,042
It started to pour.

690
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:53,792
That boss..

691
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Whenever he meets me.

692
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,167
Till his death..

693
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:00,500
He used to greet me.

694
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:03,292
What do you know?

695
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:16,167
Ask him to be take some rest.

696
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:17,417
He is coughing continuously.

697
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,750
Take some rest.

698
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:25,500
He has fallen down.
Please come..

699
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,500
Please lift him up.
- What happened?

700
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,417
What happened?

701
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:35,375
Take care of him.

702
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,792
What happened?
- He has vomited blood.

703
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,542
Sit..
Don't talk.

704
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Nothing to worry.

705
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:44,167
Distribute it.

706
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,167
Share some in this.

707
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,167
Don't stamp the cardamom.
- Fill it up.

708
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:54,292
Let me go.
- Take rest, bro.

709
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:58,417
Nothing to worry.

710
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:03,542
Let me carry my sacks.
- Wait, bro.

711
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,292
Don't talk.

712
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,167
Listen to me.
What's it?

713
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:10,542
Help him.

714
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Take some rest.
Nothing..

715
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,167
Don't talk.

716
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,042
Fill up.

717
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,417
Don't talk.
- Bro..

718
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,417
Listen..
- Leave it..

719
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:28,042
Wait..
- Leave it, I'll take care.

720
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,292
You go.
- I'll carry it.

721
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:39,500
Don't be stubborn.
Listen to me.

722
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:43,792
Take some rest.

723
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,542
I'll tie it up.

724
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,542
Don't touch it.
- Let me tie it for you.

725
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,375
Let me lift it.
- You lift it.. Take rest.

726
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:08,292
leave it.. I'm tying it
up for you to carry.

727
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:09,667
Why are you so adamant?

728
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:17,250
Listen, I'll bring it up.

729
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,542
Listen, I'll bring it up.
- I'll handle it.

730
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:22,042
Won't we help you?

731
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:24,125
He will not listen to us.
I don't know why he acts like this.

732
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:25,292
All who go to the top

733
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,792
pile up stones.

734
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:30,542
But you brought me down
through these stones

735
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:33,042
Everyone uses you as

736
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,542
a metaphor of trust.

737
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:39,792
But I trusted the mountain.

738
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:42,000
You betrayed me.

739
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:53,542
You expected me to run away?

740
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:57,542
Till my last drop of blood

741
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'll keep coming.

742
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,792
I swear on you.

743
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:22,042
Look at me.
You have to.

744
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,542
I will carry the load.

745
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,167
Brother

746
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:42,708
Please let me unload 4 baskets
of tomatoes in the village.

747
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:44,083
Load it, Logu.

748
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,167
Help him, Rangasamy.
- Pass it on.

749
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:52,000
Please move a bit.

750
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,000
Rangu, keep it aside.
- Okay.

751
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,625
Don't crush the baskets.
- Okay bro.

752
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,000
Careful.
- Hop on.

753
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,750
Careful.
- Hop on.

754
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:21,625
Make yourself comfortable.

755
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,958
Hold it tight.

756
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,167
Logu, have you got used
to new atmosphere?

757
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,792
No issues at all.

758
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:35,708
I had nothing but debts while
coming to this village.

759
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,625
I go meet the farmers

760
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,708
I buy tomatoes..

761
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:45,208
I sell it for a commission
and running my life.

762
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,625
Whatever you do.
Do it the right way.

763
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:50,792
Do maintain the records properly
and follow professional ethics.

764
00:44:51,042 --> 00:44:52,958
Run the family.
- Okay.

765
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:55,667
This village shouldn't
be a factor to turn you bad.

766
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:56,708
be careful.
- Okay.

767
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,417
Why will I go?

768
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,417
You keep quiet.

769
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:07,167
So, you will not listen.
- Accountant.

770
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:11,000
Let's go.
- Where?

771
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,542
I told you that I
will come today.

772
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,083
Let's meet Veeranan
and give the money.

773
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,958
He told that he will get
after tomorrow's registration.

774
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,375
Why are you in a hurry?

775
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,458
Let's go give the money.

776
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,500
Why are you pestering?
- You are a man of troubles.

777
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,917
Shall I leave?
- Okay.

778
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:28,167
Bye.
- Okay.

779
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:34,167
Hi brother in law.

780
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:36,458
Welcome.
Sit down.

781
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:38,708
Checking the ledger?

782
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:40,375
Tallying the remittance list.

783
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:44,417
Fine.
This man is behind me...

784
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,792
So that he can give
the money to you.

785
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:51,208
Take this money.
- I'll take it after the registration.

786
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,333
It just a day ahead.
Anyways I need to give it tomorrow.

787
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:55,917
You are a localite.

788
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:58,250
So am I.
I'll get after the deal is done.

789
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,833
I'll keep it behind the God's portrait.

790
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,875
Won't you budge to my request?

791
00:46:15,917 --> 00:46:17,917
Latch the door.

792
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,708
Are you going for registration?
- Yes.

793
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:34,208
All the best.
- Thanks.

794
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,500
Walk swiftly.
- Indeed I am.

795
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,917
I'm not walking slowly.

796
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:04,917
Woman quarreling.

797
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:10,000
Mind your business.
- Tone down.

798
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:13,417
Everything is settled.
- You are useless.

799
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,042
Don't talk.
- Why are you creating a ruckus?

800
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:21,917
Why are you selling the family
property to clear your brother's loan?

801
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,917
Have you lost your mind?

802
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,167
Let's go.
We shall leave.

803
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:31,458
I asked you to leave.
Don't talk.

804
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:34,458
I'll defame you.
Come on.

805
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:38,667
Why don't you listen to me?

806
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:42,917
My hands are tied as
it's a family issue.

807
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:46,208
Please forgive me.

808
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:48,917
It's okay.
- Forgive me.

809
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:13,458
Why are you looking dejected?

810
00:48:16,417 --> 00:48:18,500
Thinks it's our forefathers blessings.

811
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:24,375
What will we do with
the rocky land?

812
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,500
You said that there is work for
harvesting cardamom in the estate.

813
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:31,458
Go to the hill top.

814
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:34,000
Stay there for a while.

815
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:36,542
Go.

816
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:56,042
Bye, mom.

817
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Take care.

818
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:12,542
Tell me, bro.

819
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:15,792
My brother is working in SR
estate in Upparaval. - Okay.

820
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:18,708
His wife committed suicide
owing to unbearable stomach pain.

821
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:21,500
I requested some porters.

822
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,542
But they were ready to
go only in the morning.

823
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:24,750
So I came to you.

824
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:27,958
If not informed immediately,
they will push for post mortem.

825
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,958
They will take it for an autopsy. So..
- I'll inform.

826
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:30,958
Make it fast.

827
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:33,042
No need of money.
- For your conveyance.

828
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,333
I'll do it.
- Speed up.

829
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,250
I'll do the needful.
Will you join me?

830
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:37,583
I'll watch the movie
and join you tomorrow.

831
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:38,583
Take this.

832
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,667
Return this cycle in
the shop without fail.

833
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,042
Ok. Take care.
- Bye.

834
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,208
Hey!
Who is that?

835
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:15,292
Hey!
Stop.

836
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:16,708
Who is that?

837
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:18,625
Hey stop I say.

838
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,792
Stop.
Who are you?

839
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,333
Mani, Chandran, Rasa...please come.
The thieves have entered.

840
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:27,125
They are running towards the east.
Help me.

841
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:40,458
Hey flash the light.
Someone is screaming.

842
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,250
Nephew!

843
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,167
He is trapped.
Cut it off.

844
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,625
Someone hold the hip.

845
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:56,292
Hold the head.

846
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:00,167
Slowly..

847
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:08,583
Slowly...

848
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,250
Careful

849
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,583
Carry him carefully.

850
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:28,167
Who is she?
- Could you be extra careful?

851
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:30,042
Seems it Rangasamy.

852
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,792
Is it Rangasamy?
- Yes.

853
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:33,833
I was hoping that I
will get to eat pork

854
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,833
What are you doing here?

855
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,833
Go home and prepare black coffee.

856
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:40,917
Those setting a pig trap, don't know
that they should lay it on the path?

857
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,083
Be careful.
- They are coming, Eswari.

858
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:48,167
My dad is coming.
Go inside.

859
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:50,375
Come in, son in law.
- I'll leave, uncle.

860
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:52,708
Just sit for a while
and then leave.

861
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,250
Eswari.
- Dad!

862
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:56,333
Get a stool.
- Okay.

863
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,500
Sit.

864
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,917
Is the coffee ready?
- I'll bring it now.

865
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:07,458
Is it hurting much?

866
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:08,917
It's ok.
Bearable.

867
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,542
This has become their routine.

868
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:13,083
Had they caught got,
would have slayed them like pigs.

869
00:52:13,917 --> 00:52:16,125
What are you laughing at.
Pass the coffee and get inside.

870
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:20,333
As uncle was talking about
slaying a pig, it made me laugh.

871
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:25,375
It was the same gang
from the last week.

872
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:27,083
It was them whom looted
in 10 acres estate.

873
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:29,417
One day they will get caught.
Let's deal then.

874
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:33,875
Got enough sugar?

875
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,417
That's fine.
Get inside.

876
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,750
I said go.

877
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:41,958
Is it hurting much?
- It's fine.

878
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,708
Are my girls here?
- Yes they are inside.

879
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,250
Come on girls, time up.
Need to sleep.

880
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,083
Come quickly.

881
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:53,375
Be careful.
Don't get trapped again.

882
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Go.
Don't iterate the same thing.

883
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:56,167
Take extra care while going back.

884
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:58,625
Going home or Thalayangaaval.
- Thalayangaaval.

885
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:00,667
Then two of you drop him.
- No I will manage.

886
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:03,208
Those thieves might follow you.
- It's okay.

887
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:04,667
Escort him to the road.

888
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:06,333
Ok, bye.
- Fine.

889
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'll take leave as well.
- Fine.

890
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:19,625
You always keeping mocking.
- Not really, dad.

891
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:22,708
Won't he listen?
I said to stop working.

892
00:53:23,042 --> 00:53:24,292
Kangaani has informed him.

893
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:25,292
But boss doesn't agree.

894
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,667
Is kangaani there?
- Yes.

895
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,042
Stop talking and keep moving.

896
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,250
You know to demand snacks.
- Move fast.

897
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:38,042
Kangaani, stop them.

898
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,042
What? - I have informed
you many times.

899
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,417
You must employ only union members.

900
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,542
Summon everyone here.

901
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:48,417
Why do you employ less men
in such a large estate?

902
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:51,417
You must employ only union members.
Inform your boss.

903
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:53,417
What can I do?

904
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,542
I have told him many times.

905
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:56,917
He isn't listening to me.

906
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:59,375
It's your people who are
suffering of unemployment.

907
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:01,458
Ask your boss to call
the union office.

908
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:03,292
Then you can proceed.

909
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:04,500
Ask your boss to call.

910
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:06,750
Let's see tomorrow.
- We have to work.

911
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:09,417
Settle the wages.
- Move.

912
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:11,458
We mustn't allow it.

913
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:13,875
How can he work without
union members?

914
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,333
Have the union members arrived?

915
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:20,375
Speed up.

916
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:24,208
Stop talking..
Keep moving..

917
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:26,167
Why do you talk so much?

918
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:35,000
New members from the union.
Raise your hands.

919
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:42,042
Okay.

920
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,083
Ponnuthayi, take
them to the western portion.

921
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:48,667
Pasupathy, take
them to the southern portion.

922
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:51,167
Muthurasa, take
them to the north.

923
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:55,333
Have you ordered the perks?

924
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:58,125
She comes her only to have snacks.

925
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:01,542
Have patience.
- As if he will not eat it.

926
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,542
Can't you order it early?

927
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:07,250
Mind your business.

928
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:08,958
We are.

929
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:10,333
Oothuraasa.

930
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:11,958
I'll thrash you to death.

931
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:14,125
Are you showing off your attitude?

932
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:16,875
How much time will
you take, Kethara?

933
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,458
Snacks were prepared just now.

934
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,875
So it took some time.
- Come soon.

935
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,250
So long?

936
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:26,792
Open it..
Fast

937
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,375
Open it..

938
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:30,875
Open it..

939
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:34,625
3 cardamoms.. 300 jasmines.

940
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,833
You moron.

941
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:39,458
Bloody moron.

942
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:40,917
I'll kill you.

943
00:55:41,292 --> 00:55:42,833
No wages for this week.

944
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:45,125
Setting up a mockery show?

945
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,500
You losers.

946
00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:47,833
Come on.

947
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:50,417
No one from this portion
will get the payment.

948
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:57,167
Provoking me in the morning itself.

949
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:59,833
You have to come to
me to get the salary.

950
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:01,542
Get lost.

951
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,625
They never mend their ways.
They have made it a routine..

952
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:07,958
I have employed the union
members as you insisted.

953
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:09,417
Why the hell, are you coming here?

954
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:11,292
An important work.

955
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:13,458
I'm taking Oothuraasa and Bommayan.

956
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:15,500
These two will substitute.

957
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:17,208
Go.

958
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:18,292
Do as you wish.

959
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,042
My fate to blamed.

960
00:56:21,417 --> 00:56:22,417
Bomma.

961
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:23,625
Oothuraasa.

962
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:26,625
He is downstairs.
- Come here.

963
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:28,042
Here I come.

964
00:56:28,042 --> 00:56:30,292
Get the snacks.

965
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:34,042
I have got it.
No thanks.

966
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:36,042
I don't need it
- Go down.

967
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:38,667
Fast.
- Any issues?

968
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:40,417
Ravi is again creating problems.

969
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,833
Won't he listen?

970
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:46,417
Stop working.

971
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:47,750
Stop the work,

972
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:55,667
Come.

973
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,208
I have warned you several times.
(Speaking in Malayalam)

974
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:59,375
You mustn't employ lesser
labors in a larger estate.

975
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,708
Can't you understand?

976
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:04,500
We people eat unpolished rice.

977
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:06,750
But why do you support
the ragi eating Tamils?

978
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:07,958
It's not the criteria.

979
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:10,542
Language is not the barrier here.

980
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:11,708
It's for the laborers.

981
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:13,083
Nothing else.

982
00:57:13,417 --> 00:57:14,167
Is it so?

983
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:15,708
To remind you.
It's my estate.

984
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:17,917
It doesn't matter whose estate it is.
- It does, you moron.

985
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,042
It's my estate.

986
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:20,833
It's my father's.

987
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:22,417
Get out, moron.
These dogs..

988
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:24,083
Mind your tongue.

989
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:25,917
Come again..

990
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:32,125
You want job?
Serve me as slave.

991
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,042
What can you do?

992
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:37,042
Get lost, cretins.

993
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,292
Do use appropriate words.

994
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,750
Use parliamentary words.

995
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,875
Comrade.
- Get lost.

996
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:47,917
What's the problem?
- Comrade.

997
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:50,500
Ask him to use a proper language.

998
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,625
Use a proper language.

999
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:56,375
I'm speaking on behalf of the party.

1000
00:57:56,917 --> 00:58:00,042
It will not end up well.

1001
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:03,042
I ignored it, as your father passed away
before 3 months.

1002
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:06,042
Comrade, use a proper language.

1003
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:07,167
Comrade, he isn't using the appropriate words.

1004
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,667
INTERMISSION

1005
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,667
Have you paid the chit installment?

1006
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,750
Have to.

1007
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,708
Will go to hometown this Sunday.
Will pay then.

1008
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:35,417
Queue up.

1009
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:38,125
Those people of a portion can leave.

1010
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,917
You don't get salary.
Leave.

1011
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,167
I did tell you on the other day.

1012
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:42,458
You can leave.
No pay.

1013
00:58:45,917 --> 00:58:47,125
Move.

1014
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:49,292
Come get it.

1015
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:52,250
Take ti.
Keep moving.

1016
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,000
Keep quiet and move.

1017
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,250
Next.

1018
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:57,750
What shall I do with this?

1019
00:58:57,875 --> 00:58:58,875
Take.

1020
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,250
Keep quiet?

1021
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:05,917
Why should we keep quiet for
getting paid for the labor?

1022
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,500
Move.
- What shall I do with this money?

1023
00:59:09,042 --> 00:59:10,542
Why should keep quiet?

1024
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:14,042
Seems we should zip our
lips for this salary?

1025
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:15,625
Why should we?

1026
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,042
Doesn't fair words reach your ears?

1027
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:21,208
I did tell you on the other day.
You don't get paid.

1028
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:23,792
Leave.
3 cardamom and 300 jasmines.

1029
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:25,958
Bloody thieves.

1030
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,333
I will...
Money doesn't matter.

1031
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:32,875
I will kill you.
Don't you change ever?

1032
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:34,167
Hey!

1033
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:36,083
Hey!

1034
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:39,167
Oh God! I lost my money.

1035
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:40,917
Hey!

1036
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:46,708
Here take this.
- You...

1037
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,375
3 cardamoms and 300 Jasmines.

1038
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:52,792
Serve me some curry.

1039
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:55,542
Get me some meat.

1040
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:58,125
There's no meat left.
- Not so tasty.

1041
00:59:58,125 --> 01:00:00,792
It lacks salt and spice

1042
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:01,792
Shut up and eat.

1043
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:03,208
It's tasty.

1044
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:04,792
Finish it and leave the place.

1045
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:07,458
You didn't add turmeric and
also reduced the salt.

1046
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:08,875
I know to cook only this way.

1047
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:12,208
Don't buy meat henceforth.
- Lachumi.

1048
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:13,417
Take this money.

1049
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:16,458
Is the meat well cooked?

1050
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:19,167
Yes, Eswari. It's cooked well.

1051
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,583
It's good.

1052
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:27,875
Did you make the deposit?
- Yes.

1053
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:29,833
I have some savings.

1054
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:33,042
I'm planning to get her
married to a good man.

1055
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:35,000
We initiated the talks
but it didn't go well.

1056
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:36,375
You are a fool

1057
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:38,375
Rangasamy is present here.

1058
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,083
He is your nephew.

1059
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,042
Can't you stay quiet?

1060
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:43,833
I have made up my
mind to buy land

1061
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:46,375
Why do you bring the marriage matter?
- Stay quiet.

1062
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,375
You can't find a groom like this.

1063
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:52,500
Speak with your sister.

1064
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:54,542
Let me speak.

1065
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,375
See you.

1066
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:02,125
Think about my suggestion.
- Definitely.

1067
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
♫♫♫♫♫♫♫♫

1068
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:25,667
Just arrived?
- Yes.

1069
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Eswari, aren't
you keeping well?

1070
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,500
Nothing.

1071
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:33,667
Nothing to worry.

1072
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:37,125
Bhakkiyam sister proposed a marriage
alliance with Rangasamy.

1073
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:40,125
Since then she seems to be dejected.
- Bhakkiyam was indeed correct.

1074
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,125
Why didn't you think of it?

1075
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,375
Kaliamma is almost like
a sister to you.

1076
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,875
In that case this girl can
be married to Rangasamy.

1077
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,167
Yes.
- He is a good guy.

1078
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,583
You need not think twice.
He is a good guy.

1079
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,083
Are you okay with this?

1080
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,375
If Kaliamma sister agrees, I
have no objection.

1081
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:57,375
Come early in the morning.

1082
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,417
Let's discuss with Kaliamma.

1083
01:01:58,875 --> 01:01:59,875
Okay, we shall.

1084
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:02,375
Why are you roaming all over
when you have the groom ready?

1085
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:13,792
What's your opinion?

1086
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,458
He wants to get married
only after buying a land.

1087
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:20,875
Would you been born if your
parents had decided the same?

1088
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:22,375
Don't we know about it?

1089
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:23,625
Actually..

1090
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,125
Stay quiet.
- What's your final decision?

1091
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:28,792
Won't I want my son to get married?

1092
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:31,958
I give my consent.
- Your sister has agreed.

1093
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:35,458
We shall fix the engagement
on an auspicious day.- Okay.

1094
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:37,917
See you.
- Bye.

1095
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:39,208
Okay.

1096
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:44,292
Long live the revolution!

1097
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:45,917
Long live the revolution!

1098
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:48,708
Long live CPI(M)!

1099
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,417
Long live CITU.

1100
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:54,208
Down! Down!

1101
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:57,208
Capitalism down!

1102
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,125
By eradicating the
slavery of labors

1103
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:03,000
Winning over the rights
of plantation workers

1104
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:06,250
In the plantation that's
larger than 5 acres

1105
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:07,875
For all who have toiled hard..

1106
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:10,208
for establishing labor union.

1107
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,125
People who had participated in it

1108
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:18,542
And who sacrificed their
lives due to bullet injuries

1109
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,208
This rally is to salute their bravery.

1110
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:22,208
Don't feel shy.

1111
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:24,542
Everyone's here?

1112
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:26,167
Welcome, Chaako.
- Have a seat.

1113
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:27,875
Good timing.
- Eswari.

1114
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:31,583
I wanted to talk about something.
- Tell me.

1115
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:34,333
He is one of the porters in our estate.

1116
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,583
She has enrolled in
the union as well.

1117
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:38,958
It has been announced
in the conference

1118
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:40,500
that estates of 5 acres or more

1119
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:43,583
should employ the
members of union.

1120
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:46,583
Instead of registering and
working in some estate

1121
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:48,917
Let them register in our estate

1122
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,000
If they work here

1123
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:52,958
They can live in the
house in the estate.

1124
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,792
If they work
together for 4 years

1125
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:59,208
He can live prosperously
buying a land here.

1126
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:02,417
His mother can
survive of her own.

1127
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:04,208
Please do this favor.

1128
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:07,250
You are the only
Kangaani in the party.

1129
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:08,542
Would I say no to your request?

1130
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,250
Thank you.

1131
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:14,083
I need some more time.
You all can leave.

1132
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:16,417
Have food.
- No..no

1133
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:17,958
Is the jeep available?
- Yes.

1134
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,583
Shall I take leave?
- Okay.

1135
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:23,458
Bye, Eswari.

1136
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:31,250
Somehow I will get you
registered in the union

1137
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:59,083
We can hear the unheard instruments

1138
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:01,833
In this silent place

1139
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:05,042
A beautiful flower

1140
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,917
Is dancing to the song of the wind

1141
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,750
Didn't match horoscopes.

1142
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:14,375
Never sought the approval of the elders

1143
01:05:14,417 --> 01:05:18,458
My Lord show me the path.

1144
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:24,458
Come as my companion for the
welfare of the people around us.

1145
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:28,167
We can hear the unheard instruments

1146
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:31,167
...in this silent place.

1147
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:54,792
Mother, father and uncle and aunty..

1148
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:57,333
...are not strangers
when we are together.

1149
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:06,125
The unseen neighbours shower
unexpected love.

1150
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:14,458
Time cannot be judged
when we are together.

1151
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:17,375
Even as we separate...

1152
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:20,458
...the time will bring us together.

1153
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,833
Why should we fret

1154
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:26,917
we are there for each other

1155
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,458
We are there for each other
We stand for yourselves

1156
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:35,708
We can hear the unheard instruments

1157
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:38,375
In this silent place.

1158
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,375
A beautiful flower...

1159
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:44,458
... is dancing to the song of the wind.

1160
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:47,417
Didn't match horoscopes..

1161
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:52,250
Never sought the approval of the elders.

1162
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:55,458
You are the guide.

1163
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:59,875
You are the path to my wellness.

1164
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:05,000
We can hear the unheard instruments...

1165
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:07,958
... in this silent place.

1166
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:40,042
Don't know through whose penance...

1167
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:43,125
... have we come together?

1168
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,917
In this nest in this wild jungle...

1169
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:51,917
... we have come together

1170
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,375
The path that destiny paves...

1171
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:00,708
... is for everyone to travel.

1172
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:06,250
As we both go
destiny is behind us.

1173
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:09,250
The proof of our future..

1174
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:12,125
... is merely our heart..

1175
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:16,375
We don't have to live in vain
waiting for tomorrow.

1176
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:21,125
We can hear the unheard instruments...

1177
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,875
... in this silent place.

1178
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:26,958
A beautiful flower...

1179
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,792
... is dancing to the song of the wind.

1180
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:32,750
Didn't match horoscopes...

1181
01:08:32,792 --> 01:08:35,917
Didn't seek the approval of elders.

1182
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:39,792
My Lord show me the path.

1183
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:42,958
Come as my companion...

1184
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:46,333
... for the welfare of
the people around us.

1185
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:50,292
We can hear the unheard instruments...

1186
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:53,667
...in this silent place.

1187
01:08:58,333 --> 01:08:59,708
She has grown up.

1188
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:02,875
Stop it.
The old lady might hear it.

1189
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:10,375
Get inside.
- Shouldn't I clean the utensils?

1190
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:12,250
Get inside.
- You ask me to clean.

1191
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:13,750
Stop answering back.

1192
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:16,458
Chop the vegetables.

1193
01:09:17,042 --> 01:09:18,042
Get in.

1194
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:19,458
Chop it.

1195
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:21,208
Henceforth don't ask
me do any work.

1196
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:25,667
Lady

1197
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:29,917
lady

1198
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,375
Why are you feeling dejected?

1199
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,125
Excuse me.
- Nothing.

1200
01:09:36,792 --> 01:09:38,042
Share it with me.

1201
01:09:39,167 --> 01:09:40,458
She has grown up.

1202
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:43,458
What can I do staying here?

1203
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:47,958
If her parents were alive, they
wouldn't have kept her single.

1204
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:51,958
I took care of her since she was a child.

1205
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,333
Hence forth I can't.

1206
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:55,958
She has grown up.

1207
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,458
I have to get her
married very soon.

1208
01:09:58,167 --> 01:09:59,750
Her aunt is Varusanadu.

1209
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:01,917
They are good natured.

1210
01:10:03,417 --> 01:10:04,917
But she demands dowry.

1211
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:07,458
I'm ready to give it.

1212
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,875
If she get married there,
she will lead a happy life.

1213
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,833
I can't do anything
with the money I have.

1214
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,333
The land in the
foothills is unused

1215
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:19,042
I want to sell it
for her marriage.

1216
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:19,875
Okay.

1217
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:23,292
Why don't you buy the land?

1218
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,250
All of a sudden?

1219
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:27,667
What are you thinking about?

1220
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:31,958
Okay. - Consult with your
family if you wish to.

1221
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,417
I'll have a word with Eswari.

1222
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:34,792
I'll wait for a positive reply.

1223
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:36,167
Okay.
- Don't forget.

1224
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,375
See you later.

1225
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,917
How can you be silent?

1226
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,708
Nothing will happen
unless we proceed.

1227
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:49,167
We do have some money.

1228
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:50,667
If not sufficient

1229
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:52,333
we shall sell the jewelry

1230
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,083
and buy the land.

1231
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:57,458
That's a fertile land.

1232
01:10:58,458 --> 01:11:01,458
Tell Bhakkiyam that
we will buy it.

1233
01:11:02,042 --> 01:11:03,042
Okay?

1234
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:14,417
Accountant..

1235
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:16,250
Rangasamy has come.

1236
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,333
Please come.

1237
01:11:20,417 --> 01:11:21,417
Sit.

1238
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:25,333
How much money did you get?

1239
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:26,625
Actually..

1240
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:33,792
I have sold the earrings.
I have mortgaged wedding locket as well.

1241
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:36,583
But still there is shortage.

1242
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:40,167
So, I am little confused about it.

1243
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,458
You need not worry.

1244
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:52,958
Cardamoms have a good market price now.

1245
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,708
We shall meet the boss.

1246
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,958
We shall buy a sack of
cardamom at cost price.

1247
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:00,917
If you give it to merchant Damodharan

1248
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:03,958
He will sell it to a good price.

1249
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:08,542
We can clear the shortage
with that amount.

1250
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:11,917
Fine. But will help me out?

1251
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,458
You need not ask him.

1252
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:20,750
I'll talk to him.

1253
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:23,250
You don't worry.
Okay?

1254
01:12:23,792 --> 01:12:24,792
Okay.

1255
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:31,625
Come, accountant.

1256
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:32,667
Here I come.

1257
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:35,667
Greetings, boss.
- Greetings.

1258
01:12:35,708 --> 01:12:36,708
What made you come here?

1259
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:40,667
The one who works in our estate.
- Who?

1260
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:43,583
Rangasamy.
- Yes.

1261
01:12:43,917 --> 01:12:46,292
He wants to buy a land...

1262
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:48,917
He has got money is
pushing me strike a deal.

1263
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Which land?

1264
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,750
In the foot hills..

1265
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,458
There is a shop owned by Bhakkiyam.
- Yes.

1266
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:57,250
The land next to the shop.
- So what?

1267
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,000
So he wanted me to explain this to you...

1268
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,833
And make an arrangement.

1269
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,958
If you can sell him a sack of
cardamom at the actual price...

1270
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:09,042
He can resell it...

1271
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:13,125
And can manage with
the profit gained.

1272
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:16,292
I promised to talk
about it with you.

1273
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:18,458
Is it so?
- He has come with the money.

1274
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:20,708
Okay.

1275
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:25,042
Ask him to come.
- Okay.

1276
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,208
Come in.

1277
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:30,125
Greetings.
Handover the money to him.

1278
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:37,375
I have informed the accountant.

1279
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:41,000
He will get you a receipt with which
you can get a sack cardamon in the estate.

1280
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,542
Okay.

1281
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:44,667
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1282
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,167
Will leave.
- Go.

1283
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:00,375
Why are you removing your attire?

1284
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:01,708
Nothing.

1285
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:04,833
Why are you tying it to a tree?

1286
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:06,708
I said nothing.
Keep quiet.

1287
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:09,750
Why are you tying it?
- I'll let you know.

1288
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:25,125
Boss has asked to give this
receipt and take the cardamom sack.

1289
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:26,292
Oh?

1290
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:27,458
Good.

1291
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:29,250
Give it.

1292
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:31,458
Come.

1293
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:35,792
Carry it.

1294
01:14:35,917 --> 01:14:37,792
Not that.
Carry it.

1295
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:39,333
This one is of better quality.

1296
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,583
Careful.
Lift it correctly.

1297
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:48,375
Till now you have been
carrying it for your bosses.

1298
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:50,417
Today, you are carrying
it for yourself.

1299
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:54,750
I'm happy for you.

1300
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,500
Careful..

1301
01:14:57,792 --> 01:14:58,792
Careful..

1302
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:00,417
Come on..

1303
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:01,708
Let's move.

1304
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,208
Come on.
- Shall we go?

1305
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:05,667
Move.

1306
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:08,083
Where is our land?

1307
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,750
Dad will show you.

1308
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:13,083
Did you buy the cardamom?

1309
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:14,292
Yes.

1310
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:17,667
Are you coming to see our land?
- No thanks.

1311
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:18,958
Where is it?

1312
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:20,375
Wait..

1313
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,500
Where is our land?

1314
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:24,708
Dad will show it you.

1315
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:27,292
Where is our land?
- Have some patience.

1316
01:15:28,417 --> 01:15:31,500
Where is our land?
- I'll show it, dear.

1317
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:34,458
Where is our land?
- I'll show it.

1318
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:37,958
Come on.
Sit beside your mother.

1319
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,375
Where is our land?

1320
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,125
Can you see a stream?

1321
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:44,458
Yes.

1322
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:46,625
Where is it? - Look straight.
Look there.

1323
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,083
Can you see a stream?

1324
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,958
South of it there is a bund.

1325
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:51,292
Where?

1326
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:53,583
South of stream there is a bund.
Can you see it? - Yes.

1327
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Straight down the
bund is a tree.

1328
01:15:57,125 --> 01:15:58,625
Where is it?
- Look there.

1329
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:00,667
Can you see the tree?

1330
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:02,583
Where?
- Look there.

1331
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:04,917
A tree near the stream.

1332
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,250
Did you find it?

1333
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:07,417
Look there.

1334
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:08,917
Can you see it?
- Yes.

1335
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:10,542
Can you see a vaetti
tied to the tree?

1336
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:12,792
That's our land.

1337
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,208
Kethara uncle..

1338
01:16:15,417 --> 01:16:17,917
Did you see our land?
- Yes, I did.

1339
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:22,708
Wait, let me pluck some goose berries.
- Everyone, take a look at our land.

1340
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,000
This is our land.

1341
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,417
Take a look at our land..

1342
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,958
The life of poor is...

1343
01:17:06,292 --> 01:17:11,167
hanging on a weaker thread.

1344
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:16,875
This has been a
scenario for years.

1345
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:23,042
Whom shall I question this unjust?

1346
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:27,833
If You can't be our saviour...

1347
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:31,958
Then who shall be?

1348
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:36,458
We have no options left
except to embrace it.

1349
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:40,625
The life of poor is...

1350
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:45,917
hanging on a weaker thread.

1351
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:51,500
This has been a
scenario for years.

1352
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:57,292
Whom shall I question this unjust?

1353
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:29,792
The life has turned like
a rain shadow region.

1354
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:36,708
Dignity is gifted with mortality.

1355
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:42,750
The neighbors are scattered away.

1356
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:49,083
Even the blood relations are
fleeing away to foreign lands.

1357
01:18:50,042 --> 01:18:53,750
My land gazes at me.

1358
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:56,792
In return I throw a gaze at it.

1359
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,917
My land gazes at me.

1360
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,917
In return I throw a gaze at it.

1361
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:07,167
This has been the itinerary
for generations.

1362
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:11,333
The life of poor is...

1363
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:17,375
hanging on a weaker thread.

1364
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:22,167
This has been a
scenario for years.

1365
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:27,792
Whom shall I question this unjust?

1366
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,333
Sleep.

1367
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:03,958
What your mother said was true.

1368
01:20:05,292 --> 01:20:07,417
If we keep calm...

1369
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:09,042
That won't be nice.

1370
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,500
Bhakkiyam has started up the
marriage preparations.

1371
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:23,292
The land..

1372
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:25,958
Even if we can't buy..

1373
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:28,292
At least we can give some money.

1374
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,667
Can we get some loan
from Mr. Meeratha?

1375
01:20:43,292 --> 01:20:44,667
What are you thinking of?

1376
01:20:48,292 --> 01:20:49,292
Actually..

1377
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:53,625
I haven't taken
loan from anyone.

1378
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:57,083
So, I'm a little hesitant.

1379
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:00,292
Why are you feeling
hesitant about it?

1380
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:02,250
It's about marriage
life of the girl.

1381
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:05,625
Don't think.

1382
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,875
Ask him tomorrow.

1383
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:09,708
Okay.

1384
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:28,750
When did you come, bro?

1385
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:29,625
Just now.

1386
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:31,542
Have you dropped in the school?
- Yes.

1387
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,375
To whom are you buying sharbath?

1388
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:35,667
Bhakkiyam has come to
give invitations.

1389
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:38,167
Invitations?
- Your mom asked me to buy sharbath.

1390
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,208
She has come.

1391
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:44,750
She is not at home.

1392
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:47,792
They have gone for harvesting work.
She will be back by evening.

1393
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:48,833
Ok, stay at home.
I'll come soon.

1394
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,375
Here they come.

1395
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,583
Why did you take so long?

1396
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,792
When did you come?
- Just now.

1397
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:03,875
Take this.
- Give it, bro.

1398
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:15,542
Have this.

1399
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:27,042
Eswari, come here.

1400
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,083
Here I come.

1401
01:22:32,542 --> 01:22:33,542
Take it.

1402
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:35,583
Take this invitation.

1403
01:22:36,042 --> 01:22:37,042
Please do come.

1404
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,500
Here is the land document.

1405
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:39,500
What document?

1406
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:40,750
Take it.

1407
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,875
Why? I don't want to take it.
- Let me explain.

1408
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,000
Meeratha had come yesterday.

1409
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:47,208
He forced me to take the money.

1410
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,917
He asked me to
give this document

1411
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:52,917
I did try to convince
but he was adamant.

1412
01:22:53,792 --> 01:22:54,792
Keep this.

1413
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:56,750
Take it.

1414
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,000
You can talk to him.

1415
01:22:58,167 --> 01:22:59,167
I've nothing to say.

1416
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:15,083
Greetings..

1417
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:17,208
Come on, Rangasamy.

1418
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,375
Sit.

1419
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:24,625
It's okay.

1420
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:26,917
Please sit.

1421
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:36,833
Subaida, get some
water for Rangasamy.

1422
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
What's the matter?

1423
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,917
Bhakkiyam gave me this document.

1424
01:23:58,708 --> 01:23:59,750
It's yours.
Have it.

1425
01:24:00,417 --> 01:24:02,625
Why?
- I don't want to take it for free.

1426
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:05,125
So, I came to return.

1427
01:24:06,292 --> 01:24:07,292
Not for free.

1428
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:09,042
Your father's money.

1429
01:24:09,417 --> 01:24:11,750
He brought the terrain.

1430
01:24:12,417 --> 01:24:14,083
You bought it for pride.

1431
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,583
Your father and the Pannaipuram man.

1432
01:24:16,667 --> 01:24:18,667
Mookaiah and others.

1433
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:21,042
Worked hard in all circumstances.

1434
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:25,208
and made me earn this property.

1435
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:29,500
Your father had
left me with debt.

1436
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:32,500
Do you want to do the same to me?

1437
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,167
Take it.

1438
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:37,250
I'll take this if you are ready
to accept in installments.

1439
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:39,667
Else, I don't need.

1440
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Is it?

1441
01:24:41,917 --> 01:24:43,000
Okay, your wish.

1442
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:47,833
Take it. You are the witness, Kethara.
- Okay.

1443
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:49,208
Okay. - He has promised to
pay in installments.

1444
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,792
I'll receive the same.
- Okay.

1445
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:53,708
Subaida, he will give the money.

1446
01:24:53,792 --> 01:24:56,792
Collect all installments
and keep a record of it.

1447
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:58,625
Happy?

1448
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:00,125
It's not free.

1449
01:25:00,917 --> 01:25:02,083
I'll clear it somehow.

1450
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:05,167
Okay, you can happily settle it.

1451
01:25:07,042 --> 01:25:09,083
Okay?
- I'll take leave.

1452
01:25:09,417 --> 01:25:10,917
See you, later.
- Okay.

1453
01:25:14,917 --> 01:25:16,292
Seems he will clear the loan.

1454
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,792
Pray to the God.

1455
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:29,875
You have bought the land
for the first time.

1456
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:32,292
Pray to God to reap
you with benefits.

1457
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:35,792
Put a bit of motherly
earth in your mouth.

1458
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:39,208
Take some to your house.

1459
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:40,667
Brother Kethara.
- Rangu

1460
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:42,208
Pray to God.
- It's okay.

1461
01:25:42,208 --> 01:25:44,083
You carry on.
- Come on.

1462
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:46,208
Take it.

1463
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,208
Pray.

1464
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:50,708
Rangasamy.
- Brother.

1465
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:54,667
You are now a farmer.
But you didn't invite me.

1466
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:55,833
Please come.

1467
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:59,208
Take this offering.
- Pray to God.

1468
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:00,792
Come let's have a look at it.

1469
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:04,208
You have to transact everything
through my commission shop. - Okay.

1470
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:05,208
Come.

1471
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:08,083
I will wait there.
Come there, once it's done.

1472
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:28,042
Where are you leaving at this hour?

1473
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:29,625
I'll go visit our land.

1474
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:32,417
It's raining with a heavy wind flow.

1475
01:27:32,542 --> 01:27:35,208
I will just go have a look at it.
- I'm scared.

1476
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:37,792
I'm scared of the plants.
- Look at him.

1477
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,167
I have asked men to harvest.
- Don't go.

1478
01:27:41,292 --> 01:27:45,042
I have asked men to harvest.
- Don't go.

1479
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:48,167
It's flooding everywhere.
- I have asked men to harvest.

1480
01:27:48,292 --> 01:27:50,292
I will have a visit once.

1481
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:53,167
The plants will perish.

1482
01:27:53,292 --> 01:27:55,875
We can take care of it tomorrow.

1483
01:27:56,417 --> 01:27:59,042
To hell with this rain.

1484
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,500
I have to go.

1485
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:15,000
Look there.

1486
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:17,417
Look behind.

1487
01:28:20,292 --> 01:28:23,292
Last night rain has
destroyed everything.

1488
01:28:23,792 --> 01:28:26,292
We are searching
for the insane lady.

1489
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,125
Logu fertilizers shop.

1490
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:43,375
Don't worry, Rangasamy.

1491
01:28:44,292 --> 01:28:46,292
With respect to farming

1492
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:49,125
losses and gains are unpredictable.

1493
01:28:49,167 --> 01:28:50,542
Don't worry about it.

1494
01:28:51,167 --> 01:28:53,958
But if you continue
to sow conventional

1495
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:56,042
crops like maize, ragi..

1496
01:28:56,167 --> 01:28:58,958
You can't earn money.
It's doesn't benefit you.

1497
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:03,958
There are different type of new hybrid
seeds are available in the market.

1498
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:05,458
If you sow it..

1499
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:07,458
you can't trace a leaf.

1500
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,792
All you can see is the bunches
of fruits and flowers.

1501
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,250
Okay.

1502
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,500
You can get profit about
four times of investment.

1503
01:29:16,042 --> 01:29:18,292
You can earn well in 2 years.

1504
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:21,292
Okay. - You can
worry if I don't have stock.

1505
01:29:21,417 --> 01:29:22,417
I have it.

1506
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:23,500
Okay.

1507
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:26,583
I don't have money.
- Forget about money.

1508
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:27,625
Money doesn't matter.

1509
01:29:28,083 --> 01:29:29,083
Pass it.

1510
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:31,167
2 packets of seeds.

1511
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,958
The one which was
delivered yesterday.

1512
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:35,708
2 packets of seeds from it.

1513
01:29:36,083 --> 01:29:37,375
The pesticides for it

1514
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,292
Fertilizers.

1515
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,500
Give all these to Rangu.

1516
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:43,917
Don't worry about money.

1517
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:45,375
I will keep the account of the credit.

1518
01:29:46,208 --> 01:29:47,833
Pay once you get money.
- Okay.

1519
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:51,250
Pay as per your convenience.
I'll keep the record.

1520
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:52,750
Men are important.

1521
01:29:53,542 --> 01:29:55,458
It's you that I need to help.

1522
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:59,333
I left my village and came
here with no money.

1523
01:29:59,667 --> 01:30:02,292
I'm here today just
because of you.

1524
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:06,292
If we can't help each other,
it doesn't make any sense.

1525
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:08,375
If you can't get profit this year

1526
01:30:08,917 --> 01:30:10,792
you will pay the next time.

1527
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:12,125
I will get it.

1528
01:30:13,292 --> 01:30:15,292
You don't hesitate.

1529
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:17,375
Don't worry.
I'm here to help.

1530
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:18,792
Be strong.

1531
01:30:28,292 --> 01:30:32,583
What do people have to say
about our conference?(Speaking in Malayalam)

1532
01:30:32,792 --> 01:30:35,292
It was better than
what we expected.

1533
01:30:36,292 --> 01:30:40,000
Did people from Ottathi?

1534
01:30:40,542 --> 01:30:44,292
He brought the people
as he promised.

1535
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:46,292
Comrade is the in charge of
Sadhurangaparai, isn't it?

1536
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,667
How many people came from that place?

1537
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:50,667
I expected around 300 to 350.

1538
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:52,333
Around 500 to 550 men had come.

1539
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:53,667
What about Manathoadu?

1540
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:57,208
What about Manathoadu?
- I'm not the in charge for it.

1541
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:58,542
I was dealing with Parathoadu.

1542
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:02,542
But 6 to 7 trucks of people
have come from there.

1543
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:05,250
I did see my self.
7 trucks had come.

1544
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:09,042
I wanted to discuss something
since 2 to 3 days.

1545
01:31:09,208 --> 01:31:11,458
But I wasn't able to?
- What's it, comrade?

1546
01:31:11,708 --> 01:31:13,083
About the new roads.

1547
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:15,833
Your thoughts about the roads?

1548
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:17,875
What's our problem with the roads?

1549
01:31:17,917 --> 01:31:19,333
We have concerns.

1550
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,333
The new roads bring
machineries to the estates.

1551
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:27,083
Will it affect our laborers?

1552
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:30,125
It is his concern.
- How will it affect our laborers?

1553
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:32,625
The will not affect directly.

1554
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:35,875
The machineries will
reduce the work force.

1555
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:37,958
We will employ them in
some other jobs then.

1556
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:41,042
All who is going to suffer
is the poor laborers.

1557
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:42,333
It will affect them.

1558
01:31:42,417 --> 01:31:44,292
It's not possible.

1559
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:45,292
If it happens..

1560
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:49,417
You always seems to be opposing any
new reform in the party or nation.

1561
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,292
Chaako is not finding
mistakes in your statement.

1562
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:57,250
He is not against the machineries

1563
01:31:57,583 --> 01:32:00,542
How will these machineries
affect our labors?

1564
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:03,583
We will decide it then.
- No.. no.

1565
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:05,125
A true communist

1566
01:32:05,542 --> 01:32:09,000
... is one who thinks before
something happens not after it.

1567
01:32:09,042 --> 01:32:10,833
Are you teaching communism to me?

1568
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:13,125
I'm not teaching it, but
telling you the fact.

1569
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:16,875
My work in the national movements
through out the nation..

1570
01:32:16,917 --> 01:32:19,875
Do you have any idea?
- That's not the issue now.

1571
01:32:19,917 --> 01:32:22,042
Decision making must
very futuristic.

1572
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:25,000
Don't try to teach me.
- I'm not teaching you.

1573
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:29,917
A communist working for laborers
shouldn't use such words.

1574
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,958
Why did you lose words?
- I have done a lot.

1575
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:36,417
He is defending our men.

1576
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:17,375
Comrade..
- Yes, comrade.

1577
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:19,917
We spoke loud against Sasi comrade.

1578
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:25,125
He told that he was in a bad mood
so he spoke out of frustration

1579
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:27,792
Nothing to worry.
- I have been telling it.

1580
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:30,917
But he is ignoring it.
- We shall clear it.

1581
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:33,333
There is some problem
in Munaar estate.

1582
01:33:33,458 --> 01:33:35,000
Comrade Rajaiah is not available.

1583
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:37,333
So, some one from
here has to go there.

1584
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:38,917
So, Sasi comrade has asked you to go.

1585
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:42,458
While leaving, deliver this
letter to Devi Kulam party office.

1586
01:33:42,542 --> 01:33:43,542
Devi Kulam office?

1587
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:45,750
What about the conference?

1588
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:48,708
I will manage with the
workforce there. - Bye.

1589
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Okay.

1590
01:33:57,042 --> 01:33:59,042
What are you doing?
- Stop it.

1591
01:33:59,292 --> 01:34:00,750
Why are you locking it up?

1592
01:34:00,833 --> 01:34:03,125
Should we end up in the streets?

1593
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:04,208
What's this?

1594
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:06,875
It's a court order.
Whatever it is.. deal it legally.

1595
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:08,750
Got it?
- We aren't bothered about it.

1596
01:34:08,917 --> 01:34:10,417
We will not allow you to lock.

1597
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,833
I'll not let you do it.

1598
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:27,583
Done?
Let's go.

1599
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:35,583
Where can we go if
you ask to leave?

1600
01:34:35,833 --> 01:34:36,833
Wait..

1601
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:41,292
Please try to understand.
It's a court order.

1602
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:43,958
I have nothing to do with it.
Work in some other estate.

1603
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:45,625
We have no where to go.

1604
01:34:46,292 --> 01:34:48,500
It's an government order.
We can't help it.

1605
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:49,958
You can look for some other job.

1606
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:53,375
No.. no I can't help it.

1607
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:56,292
Please do consider us.
- I can't help it.

1608
01:34:57,083 --> 01:34:59,833
We beg you.
- I have nothing to do

1609
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:21,708
Hey!

1610
01:35:22,042 --> 01:35:23,042
Hey!

1611
01:35:23,167 --> 01:35:24,583
Chaako.
- What's it?

1612
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:25,958
Are you leaving for Munaar?

1613
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,500
I need not discuss it with you.

1614
01:35:27,708 --> 01:35:28,917
Then with whom will you discuss with?

1615
01:35:30,042 --> 01:35:32,500
You were an obstacle
to one of my works.

1616
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:34,042
So, I cleared you out.

1617
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:37,500
I have bought Thalayankaaval estate.
- What?

1618
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,375
Thalayankaaval estate where Tamils work.

1619
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:41,292
I have bought it.
Do you know how?

1620
01:35:41,667 --> 01:35:43,083
As 2 acres,3 acres and 4 acres.

1621
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,708
I've shared it as parts
among the family.

1622
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:48,625
If I own 5 acres your
union dogs come there.

1623
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,250
Will you come there?

1624
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:51,583
I forgot.

1625
01:35:51,917 --> 01:35:53,708
While buying the estate..
The comrade..

1626
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:55,833
Comrade Sasi..
I have brought him as well.

1627
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:59,667
You can buy any thing in
this world with money.

1628
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:00,958
I have court orders.

1629
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:02,833
What?

1630
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:05,750
If something happens to the labors

1631
01:36:06,833 --> 01:36:09,375
I'll kill you.
- Scoot.

1632
01:36:14,042 --> 01:36:17,500
Did I teach you the lesson I promised to?
- Get lost.

1633
01:36:30,167 --> 01:36:31,167
Pour some for me.

1634
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:39,417
Have it.

1635
01:36:43,833 --> 01:36:46,958
They have destroyed our lives
and brought us to streets

1636
01:36:47,167 --> 01:36:50,167
They have left no shelter to us.
But you are boozing.

1637
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:52,625
Why wait here?
Let's go.

1638
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:10,250
Call me.

1639
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:12,833
Call me now.

1640
01:37:13,917 --> 01:37:14,917
Who else will?

1641
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:18,417
3 cardamoms..300 jasmines

1642
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,417
Will anyone in the
plains call me by names?

1643
01:37:22,042 --> 01:37:23,042
You call me.

1644
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:24,500
Call me

1645
01:37:24,917 --> 01:37:26,958
You..
You call me..

1646
01:37:27,792 --> 01:37:29,375
Is your mouth stuffed?

1647
01:37:29,417 --> 01:37:30,708
Oothu rasa.

1648
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,750

Call me..

1652
01:37:39,417 --> 01:37:42,292
Some one please
call me by names?

1653
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:44,917
Please don't do it.

1654
01:37:45,708 --> 01:37:48,750
Please listen to me..
- Please call me..

1655
01:37:50,583 --> 01:37:53,250
3 cardamoms..300 jasmines
- Don't cry.

1656
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:57,375
Who will dare to call me by names?

1657
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,042
Call me..

1658
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:00,833
Let's go.

1659
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:03,375
Some one please call me..

3 cardamoms..300 jasmines

1661
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:08,417
Where are you going?
Drop your baggage..

1662
01:38:08,625 --> 01:38:12,500
They have asked us to leave the place.

1663
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:15,083
I'll take care of you.

1664
01:38:15,292 --> 01:38:16,958
Bring me the sickle.

1665
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:20,250
They have taken our bread
and butter. - Not to worry.

1666
01:38:20,292 --> 01:38:23,042
We have nothing left.
- Drop your baggage..

1667
01:38:23,292 --> 01:38:25,292
Come with me.

1668
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:28,958
Please do something..

1669
01:38:44,292 --> 01:38:45,667
Sasi bro.(Speaking in Malayalam)
- Yes

1670
01:38:46,292 --> 01:38:53,167
Ask me for any favour
without any hesitation.

1671
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,875
You need not mention it.
I do know.

1672
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:59,667
I want to tell you something.

1673
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:01,083
What's the sound?

1674
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:08,625
Chaako.

1675
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:12,042
Listen to me, Chaako.

1676
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:15,583
You have joined him by
betraying the laborers?

1677
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,500
Is this the communism you learnt?

1678
01:40:04,417 --> 01:40:05,542
Come.

1679
01:42:17,792 --> 01:42:19,792
5 YEARS LATER

1680
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:56,500
Who is it?
- Is Rangasamy in?

1681
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:57,625
Yes.

1682
01:43:57,625 --> 01:43:58,875
He is sleeping.

1683
01:43:58,875 --> 01:44:00,458
What's it about?

1684
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:02,000
Mr. Logu wants you to meet him.

1685
01:44:14,625 --> 01:44:17,250
Dear..

1686
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:19,375
Mr. Logu wants you to meet him.

1687
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:07,750
Come, Rangasamy.

1688
01:45:12,833 --> 01:45:14,625
I don't know how to say it.

1689
01:45:14,667 --> 01:45:16,417
But I have no option left.

1690
01:45:17,458 --> 01:45:18,625
After you were jailed..

1691
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:21,083
As she was suffering alone

1692
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:22,500
Whenever she asked

1693
01:45:22,708 --> 01:45:25,875
I have asked anything that was required.

1694
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:30,458
Now when I checked the credit..
The capital and interest is huge.

1695
01:45:30,667 --> 01:45:33,500
Years have passed.
Listen Rangu.

1696
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:34,625
If it was someone else

1697
01:45:34,708 --> 01:45:37,042
I would have recovered
the other way.

1698
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:44,000
You helped me when I
came here empty handed.

1699
01:45:44,667 --> 01:45:47,583
To pay back that

1700
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:49,750
I don't mind the losses

1701
01:45:50,042 --> 01:45:54,000
Register your land on my name.
That's enough.

1702
01:45:59,167 --> 01:46:00,792
Hey.

1703
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:02,958
If I check the credit..

1704
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:05,708
This will not even
match the credit.

1705
01:46:07,417 --> 01:46:09,542
It's okay.
Sign it.

1706
01:46:09,917 --> 01:46:12,708
Sign here.
Sign on the marked area.

1707
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:35,042
You don't worry.

1708
01:46:35,625 --> 01:46:36,792
I have recommended you a job

1709
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:39,833
There's a vacancy in the same land.

1710
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:42,125
I know him.

1711
01:46:42,542 --> 01:46:44,292
After some days

1712
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:45,750
Meet me.

1713
01:46:45,917 --> 01:46:50,583
Sir, I know him.
Please assign the job to him.

1714
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:52,750
Pity on him.

1715
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:54,750
Hey.
- Yes, sir.

1716
01:46:55,292 --> 01:46:58,375
Get him some food and escort him.

1717
01:47:41,708 --> 01:47:43,125
Pass the spanner.

1718
01:47:43,792 --> 01:47:45,292
Palchamy Brother.

1719
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:46,750
Come.

1720
01:47:51,958 --> 01:47:53,375
What happened?

1721
01:47:53,417 --> 01:47:55,250
They asked me to join tomorrow.

1722
01:47:55,875 --> 01:47:57,375
They have given me
the uniform too.

1723
01:47:57,917 --> 01:47:59,917
I'll have to pick
labors for estate work.

1724
01:48:00,542 --> 01:48:01,542
Wait near my house.

1725
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:03,125
I'll drop you in Thaevaaram.

1726
01:48:16,042 --> 01:48:18,792
Rangasamy, the vehicle has come.

1727
01:48:56,792 --> 01:48:58,417
Come Rangu.
Get in.

1728
01:49:28,792 --> 01:49:32,667
See you. - See you, bro.
- Okay.

1729
01:51:57,625 --> 01:52:05,375
Dedicated to 'The landless
labour class across the world.
