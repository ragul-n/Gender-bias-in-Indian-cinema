1
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:56,500
"Laila and Majnu were one soul
in two bodies"

2
00:02:56,501 --> 00:03:02,441
"They were the ideal symbols
of true love"

3
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:08,501
"They were the ideal symbols
of true love"

4
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:15,081
"They were the ideal symbols
of true love"

5
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:23,921
"Laila and Majnu were one soul
in two bodies"

6
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:38,971
"There were two clans with
old feud amidst them"

7
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:45,971
"These two were the offspring's
of those two clans"

8
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:51,691
"In whose hearts hatred
resided..."

9
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:57,901
"...and this hatred became
a legend later."

10
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:04,101
"God's will became a reality"

11
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:10,311
"Their Madrasa became
a place of hatred"

12
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:16,381
"Their love blossomed amidst
this hatred"

13
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:22,891
"Their love blossomed amidst
this hatred"

14
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:31,961
"Laila and Majnu were one soul
in two bodies"

15
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:38,971
"One day a priest in the
Madrasa said:..."

16
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:44,001
"...'All of you write the name
of God in your slate.'"

17
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:49,081
"All wrote except Majnu"

18
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:54,551
"He was engrossed in writing
the name of Laila."

19
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:59,661
"He was engrossed in writing
the name of Laila."

20
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:04,331
"The teacher was enraged
at this"

21
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:09,291
"He couldn't control his anger"

22
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:14,541
"He severely punished Majnu"

23
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:19,741
"But its effect was on Laila"

24
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:24,711
"But its effect was on Laila"

25
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:29,881
"The priest on seeing this..."

26
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:34,991
"...repented for his mistake"

27
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:40,101
"The innocent love
became known to all"

28
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:45,391
"They became the talk
of the town"

29
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:50,401
"When Laila's father
heard of this,..."

30
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:55,541
"...he was ashamed and enraged"

31
00:05:55,881 --> 00:06:00,681
"He stopped Laila
from going to the school"

32
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:05,751
"He forbade her from
leaving the house"

33
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:14,721
"One day evading all guards..."

34
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:20,701
"...Laila and Majnu
were absconding"

35
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:26,841
"Both the clans were frightened
out of their wits"

36
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:33,141
"Swords came out of
their sheaths"

37
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:43,121
"Those who passed by
that way..."

38
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:52,761
"...were frozen with fear"

39
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:59,041
"Laila and Majnu were
engrossed in playing"

40
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:17,251
"Laila and Majnu were
engrossed in playing"

41
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:29,501
"Majnu looked attentively and
said to Laila's father:..."

42
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:41,681
"...'Please allow us to play,
don't separate us.'"

43
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:47,291
"Laila's father said
with anger:..."

44
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:52,361
"...'Tomorrow this very play
can become a reason.'"

45
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:57,261
"'It might be the downfall
of our families.'"

46
00:07:57,701 --> 00:08:02,471
"'It might bring disgrace
to our families.'"

47
00:08:02,911 --> 00:08:07,501
"Saying this, he grabbed
Laila's hands..."

48
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:12,651
"...and took her away with him."

49
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:18,061
"...and took her away with him."

50
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:38,041
"No one saw them later"

51
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:44,681
"God knows in which
tribe they stayed"

52
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:50,921
"God knows in which
tribe they stayed"

53
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:57,731
"God knows in which
tribe they stayed"

54
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:40,771
Is there anyone to
hike the rate?

55
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:47,141
It's final on 9 dinar.
Last word 9 dinar once.

56
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,451
Nine dinar twice.

57
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,981
10 dinar.
- 10 dinar once...

58
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:56,691
11 dinar
- 12 dinar...

59
00:09:56,901 --> 00:10:01,531
13 dinar
- 14 dinar

60
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:07,301
15 dinar
- 20 dinar

61
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:10,961
22 dinar
- 24.50 dinar

62
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,071
24.75 dinar

63
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:15,541
Increasing the price
within yourselves only?

64
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:16,741
Yes.
- That's bad.

65
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:24,011
21 dinar once, twice...
- 24 dinar.

66
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,421
2200 dinar

67
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,691
Cost of a camel is
2200 dinar...

68
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:33,061
I mean for all camels...
- All camels...

69
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:37,631
Donkeys, have the status to
purchase all the camels?

70
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:43,031
One animal's less.
Tell me your price also.

71
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,571
I'll complete the deal
by purchasing you.

72
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,411
What did you say?
- Inspector.

73
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:55,691
Beware one and all,
here comes the inspector...

74
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:58,081
...with a sword in hand.

75
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:01,781
These 3 look like
aliens here.

76
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:05,551
But you belong to
this place.

77
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,491
Don't you know, it's a crime
to break the law here.

78
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,731
It was started by
these rogues.

79
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,601
If I get a proof,
I'll blacken their face and ...

80
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,001
...make them ride on
a donkey.

81
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,741
Tell me, who started first?

82
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,981
Shut up.
- Shut up.

83
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:26,351
First Mr. Tabrej took out
the sword from the cover.

84
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:29,141
Then you wander only with
the cover.

85
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,991
I'll tell your dad,
your sword's confiscated by me.

86
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,231
You didn't blacken his face.
Are you scared?

87
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,731
Scared and me?

88
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:42,021
Shut up.
- Shut up.

89
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:43,601
Why should I fear any one?

90
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,801
I'm the constable of the king.

91
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,371
Beware soldiers,
I'm ready to attack.

92
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:53,781
Attack...
March one two...

93
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:07,381
Oh God !
What's this untimely storm?

94
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,021
What does the nature want?

95
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:11,821
Attack...

96
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:33,571
Madam, come,
let's go from here.

97
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:42,311
This storm has stopped
by bringing us together.

98
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:48,131
But the storm in my heart
will never calm down.

99
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:57,601
Crook.

100
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,911
The man you were gaping at
is behind us now.

101
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:13,211
Wait Gulbadan.
- What are your intentions?

102
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,821
Let me see him properly.

103
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:20,421
But why?
- God only knows.

104
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:37,341
That Romeo's following you
like a nut. Come...

105
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,571
Today there are no bells
in your legs, Madam.

106
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,311
You need leg cuff instead.

107
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:25,821
You're the height, Madam.

108
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:28,561
Got attracted to an alien
in an open market.

109
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:31,621
Felt a oneness in him...

110
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,631
Know whom you are chasing?

111
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:41,341
That she knows...

112
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:44,941
Wonderful, by involving us
in the deal of camels...

113
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,071
...you're busy flirting
with a girl here.

114
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,821
That shameless chap is
still following us.

115
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:54,781
Walk fast madam, so that
we can escape from him.

116
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:00,591
Can anyone escape from his fate?

117
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:04,061
What did you say?
- Come...

118
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,061
In all we've purchased 50 camels.
Come and have a look.

119
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:11,361
Now I don't wish to see anything.

120
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:16,871
Let him keep dreaming.
Let's go and do our job.

121
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:19,971
Earlier, he used to hate
the sight of girls.

122
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,381
God knows, what magic
has she done on him.

123
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,951
Forgot his childhood
episodes of love?

124
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,011
At a very young age...

125
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,841
...he had to wash off his
hands with his love.

126
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:52,191
This body as though
carved out of marble...

127
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:56,441
...I crave to make it
my own.

128
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:02,151
Your lips look as though
they're dripping of red wine.

129
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:06,411
I wish to get intoxicated
by sipping that wine.

130
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:23,291
The delicate storm that's
roaring in your tender heart.

131
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,971
I wish to plunge deep
into this storm.

132
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:34,471
Don't know since when
I know you.

133
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:38,981
But I wish I could lay my
life for this beauty.

134
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:18,151
The anklet in your leg is
luckier than me.

135
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:23,791
I wish, I was an anklet.

136
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:54,661
Keep this anklet for
tomorrow.

137
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:59,021
Under that pretext you
can come here again.

138
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:56,681
Stop this fight.
- Stop it.

139
00:20:56,951 --> 00:21:02,091
Beware, here comes the
inspector with the sword.

140
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:07,261
Drive these rogues out of
this place immediately.

141
00:21:08,731 --> 00:21:10,861
Last time,
I had seen these trio.

142
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:13,571
Trio...
- Where has this 4th one come today?

143
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,931
I've come to frighten
the big bullies here.

144
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:21,981
Beware. Throw your sword
in front of me.

145
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,841
I won't spare you otherwise.

146
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:26,911
To hell with your
inspector...

147
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:34,621
Insulting me? Don't you know,
I apply butter daily?

148
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,291
That's evident
from your looks.

149
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:37,981
You're an expert in
applying butter.

150
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:41,531
You've become an inspector
may be, by pacifying only.

151
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:47,161
You're correct. He might be
a rich father's son.

152
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:51,771
First, I'll extract 2 Kg.
of butter from his father.

153
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,441
Later on I'll pardon...
Where have they vanished?

154
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:02,091
Beware, the inspector's
ready to attack...

155
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:43,251
Gulbadan.
- Yes Madam.

156
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:46,321
How come this anklet in my leg...

157
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:50,091
If the anklet's not in the leg,
will it be on the head then?

158
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:54,101
This is the same anklet that
I saw in the market yesterday.

159
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:55,641
In the market?
- Yes.

160
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:03,141
Yes, it's the same one.
Oh God...

161
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:08,341
I've told you many times,
don't wander in these gardens.

162
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:11,081
Definitely some ghost might've
fallen in love with you.

163
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,151
And that must've given you
this anklet.

164
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:17,361
Only in one leg?
- Might be an old time lover.

165
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:19,461
He couldn't have seen
the other leg.

166
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:20,601
Shut up.

167
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:22,991
Surely, last night, you would've
played a trick on me.

168
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:27,761
It's a man's job to play a
mischief at night.

169
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:31,841
I'm myself waiting since long...

170
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:35,971
...for someone to come and
play a mischief with me.

171
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:38,451
No one comes even
in my dreams.

172
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:41,181
Not even a rat, Madam.

173
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:46,251
What are you thinking?

174
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:52,291
If you haven't done then surely
he must've done this.

175
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:56,161
Who? You mean that
market lover?

176
00:23:56,731 --> 00:24:01,141
Evading all this thick security
how could he come here?

177
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:03,341
Must've come flying on the
wings of love...

178
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,581
...made me wear the anklet
and gone back.

179
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:33,091
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklets..."

180
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:38,111
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklets..."

181
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:43,811
"Wonderful is she who
has worn these anklets"

182
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:48,951
"Wonderful is she who
has worn these anklets"

183
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:54,821
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklet..."

184
00:24:57,531 --> 00:25:02,801
"I wish to sacrifice myself
for her hair and lovely lips"

185
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:08,031
"I wish to sacrifice myself
for her hair and lovely lips"

186
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:13,741
"Her looks were fiery and
her face was lovely"

187
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:19,041
"Her looks were fiery and
her face was lovely"

188
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:24,311
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklet..."

189
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:30,321
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklet..."

190
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:51,911
"Youth craved for this
beauty since ages"

191
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:59,621
"Youth craved for this
beauty since ages"

192
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:05,231
"Wish I could be her heart-beat"

193
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:11,001
"Oh! The one who's coming
stealthily..."

194
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:13,231
"Oh! The one who's coming
stealthily..."

195
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,301
"...lovely is your love"

196
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:21,401
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklet..."

197
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:27,181
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklet..."

198
00:26:48,971 --> 00:26:55,041
"The sleeping beauty had
colorful dreams in her eyes"

199
00:26:57,111 --> 00:27:02,641
"The sleeping beauty had
colorful dreams in her eyes"

200
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:07,951
"I've flicked them from her eyes"

201
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:13,691
"I've flicked them from her eyes"

202
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:19,401
"I thank my fate for
what has happened to me"

203
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:24,571
"I thank my fate for
what has happened to me"

204
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:30,181
"Her looks are wavery and her
body's depicting mischief"

205
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:35,811
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklet..."

206
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:54,631
"I'm looking for him again"

207
00:27:56,871 --> 00:28:02,611
"I'm looking for him again"

208
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:07,941
"I'm tempted to see her
for a second time"

209
00:28:08,051 --> 00:28:13,621
"I'm tempted to see her
for a second time"

210
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:19,231
"Wow! What a pain the heart
feels, when in love"

211
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:24,431
"Wow! What a pain the heart
feels, when in love"

212
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:29,671
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklet..."

213
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:35,211
"I wish to sacrifice myself
for her hair and lovely lips"

214
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:40,281
"Wonderful is she who
has worn these anklets"

215
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:45,511
"Wonderful is she who
has worn these anklets"

216
00:28:45,821 --> 00:28:50,821
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklet..."

217
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:56,831
"Wow! What a jingle
of the anklet..."

218
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:06,701
Today, the inspector's not
there for your safety.

219
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:11,971
When God's above us...
...and sword's with us...

220
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:19,121
There's also a grave yard.
Quit this city just now...

221
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:23,981
...or else I'll bury all of
you in this grave yard.

222
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:29,751
Is it your family trade
to dig graves?

223
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:33,831
It's my job to reach the
arrogance to hell.

224
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:37,841
The wise raise their swords
against atrocity...

225
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:39,731
...and not to commit a crime.

226
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:44,671
Daddy, atrocities of these
rogues have become intolerable.

227
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:47,781
These loafers are bullying
the entire market.

228
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:49,451
They were dancing and singing.

229
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,011
This is an age to dance
and play, son.

230
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:54,851
You're not cut out for
this type of joy.

231
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,221
Learn to be patient.

232
00:29:57,561 --> 00:30:00,531
Leave them on their own.

233
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:09,501
On behalf of my son,
pardon me, son.

234
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:14,671
You've lovingly called me, son.

235
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:17,601
By apologizing don't
make me feel embarrassed.

236
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:20,171
You're like my...
You can order me now.

237
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:23,821
Long live. Like your lovely
face...

238
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:25,811
...your talk is also sweet.

239
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:28,621
Looks like you come from
a reputed family.

240
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:34,821
Like his height,
he comes from a high family.

241
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:39,121
He belongs to Amari family
and his name's Kaish.

242
00:30:43,171 --> 00:30:46,631
Sir, why have you become quiet?

243
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:50,271
You belong to such a
family that...

244
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:54,511
...it's better for you to
leave this city and go away.

245
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:58,381
Why sir?
- I'm not sure of my son.

246
00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:01,281
If you're in this town...

247
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:04,621
...my son will be tempted
to use his sword soon.

248
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:11,591
May be, he thinks that his
son is a brave man.

249
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,371
If he removes his
sword in future...

250
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:18,201
...we'll break his bones.

251
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:22,071
Let's go and buy sheep.

252
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:46,771
Oh! God...

253
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:51,201
She's sleeping obliviously
after snatching my sleep.

254
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:55,141
I wish to take pity on
this face full of emotions.

255
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:06,081
You're quiet since long.
Say something.

256
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:11,611
Should you torture me more?

257
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:24,701
Oh! God...

258
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:50,961
The leg's bare.
Oh! beautiful damsel...

259
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:55,331
Yesterday I had given my
heart with the anklet.

260
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:58,431
How could you refuse that?

261
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:03,201
Then I'll take back
the other anklet.

262
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:21,191
I've barged in here without
your permission.

263
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:24,961
No. For the mistake you've
done to me, while I was asleep...

264
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:28,261
...I wish to punish
you for that act.

265
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:32,801
Pronounce your punishment. I'll
accept it with my head bowed down

266
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:36,271
Make me wear one anklet
and take away the other.

267
00:33:36,811 --> 00:33:41,041
This act will never end.
- But why?

268
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:45,151
As long as it's night after day,
you keep coming here.

269
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:47,111
Let our friendship bloom.

270
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:01,701
May God never make the
sun rise after today.

271
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:02,971
Why so?

272
00:34:03,701 --> 00:34:06,801
Just by giving permission
to meet at nights...

273
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,301
...you've really punished me.

274
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:13,141
Everyday will be a day
of disaster to me.

275
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:16,111
It's tough for me to live
away from you.

276
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:21,491
Look, if days keep passing
without you besides me...

277
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,291
...one day, I'll also die.

278
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:29,061
Is such a blind love
possible on this earth?

279
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,931
It's not possible if love
remains as love only.

280
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:40,371
My love's a worship,
a means for me to live.

281
00:34:41,011 --> 00:34:43,981
I and my love are there
in every breath of yours.

282
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:46,641
You're there in my
heart beat.

283
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:49,581
Stop it for God's sake.

284
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:52,641
Don't make me go mad
with your love.

285
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,591
Ever since I've seen you...

286
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:56,821
...I'm lost in your thoughts.

287
00:34:57,691 --> 00:35:01,061
You're there in my dreams
and when I'm awake.

288
00:35:02,531 --> 00:35:05,691
What a magic have you
done on me.

289
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:09,171
After all who are you,
O stranger?

290
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:15,541
I'm a stranger,
but am your adorer.

291
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:21,041
Open the door...
- Brother...

292
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:28,221
Open the door...
- Is everything O.K. ?

293
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:45,161
You shouldn't walk
in mid night.

294
00:35:45,471 --> 00:35:48,911
If your stomach's paining,
take a hot fomentation.

295
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:52,311
Gulabo said that a thief
has entered the house.

296
00:35:52,581 --> 00:35:55,481
Not in the house,
but in the heart...

297
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:58,811
In the heart...?
- It's your illusion.

298
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:01,921
I haven't seen any thief here.

299
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:08,291
Only one anklet in one leg,
where's the other one?

300
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:11,131
Perhaps your thief must
have taken that.

301
00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:15,631
You're very naughty.
Is this any time to joke?

302
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:17,731
Then go and sleep.

303
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:37,911
Is he your brother?
- Have you met him already?

304
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:43,191
I've tried my luck with
your family.

305
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,631
Sister's hurting her lover
with cupid arrows...

306
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,131
...while the brother is
attacking with his sword.

307
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,871
With a sword? Then you
should go away quickly.

308
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:54,371
Now, when the ground's empty,
why should I go?

309
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:58,401
Such a provocative face
is there before me...

310
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:02,241
...that my thirst is not
at all quenched.

311
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:04,811
Your life's in danger by
staying here.

312
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:07,211
Why don't you understand
and be matured?

313
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,251
For lovers, the heart rules
over their heads.

314
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,721
And this is the voice of
my heart.

315
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:13,791
How will I be at peace
when I'm away from you.

316
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,151
Wish I could live and die
here only.

317
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,061
What are you saying?
May God give you a long life.

318
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:22,201
Madam, now stop talking of
death in our long youth.

319
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,371
Instead come and embrace me.

320
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:29,271
You're very adamant.
For God's sake save yourself.

321
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:30,841
Go away from here.
I'll meet you elsewhere.

322
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:32,781
Trying to evade me?

323
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:37,611
I swear, I'll meet you
tomorrow at noon.

324
00:37:37,851 --> 00:37:39,151
Afternoon....
- Yes....

325
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,521
By meeting at noon, should
we collect dates there?

326
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,781
Let's meet at night to
cherish our wishes.

327
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,761
I'll wait for you at
midnight. Do come.

328
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:58,841
Good night.

329
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:15,151
My dear father,
accept my salutations.

330
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:21,561
I received your letter.
I'm at your beck and call.

331
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:26,031
I'm forced to stay here.

332
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:32,941
I'm sending all the camels
that I've purchased to you...

333
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:35,861
...except one camel that
I'm withholding with me.

334
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:41,481
Treat this as my fate
or a coincidence.

335
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:46,151
One day there was a lightning
in scorching heat.

336
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:48,711
It went off emitting fire.

337
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:53,351
Even the camel couldn't
tolerate its sparkle.

338
00:38:53,691 --> 00:38:55,861
Why point your finger
towards the camel?

339
00:38:56,131 --> 00:38:58,321
Why don't you decently
accept that...

340
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:00,731
...your eyes couldn't
bear that sparkle?

341
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:04,401
Write this also that the
eye-paint is being made.

342
00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:09,071
But that you don't have
a container to put that.

343
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:26,211
Had I wished, I could've
pierced this arrow through you.

344
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:30,061
But I bestow some more
moments of life on you.

345
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:52,211
Had I wished, I could've
pierced your own arrow in you.

346
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:57,381
But recently a girl has lit
a lamp of love in my heart.

347
00:39:57,721 --> 00:40:00,321
So, I've no place for
enmity in my heart.

348
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:06,431
So, you too change yourself
and be decent with me.

349
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:14,471
Bastard, how dare he calls
me his brother-in-law...?

350
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:48,071
Nature has adorned you
with its own hands.

351
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:52,001
I wish, I could just keep
seeing you.

352
00:40:52,881 --> 00:40:56,371
Your smiling face resembles
a full moon.

353
00:40:56,951 --> 00:41:00,941
I wish I could engrave
this look in me.

354
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:10,961
No one can dare
touch me.

355
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:15,471
I wish I could touch you
and swear this.

356
00:41:20,671 --> 00:41:24,871
Thanks for your kindness
and warmth.

357
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,781
You've showered a
new life on me.

358
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:31,811
Oh! God!
were you awake?

359
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:34,551
Now my fate is also awake.

360
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:37,921
Am I late?
- Not at all.

361
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:41,591
You've come long ago.
- Since when?

362
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:46,091
In my dreams and
imaginations.

363
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:50,631
Long before that
moon could rise...

364
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:54,031
...my moon is sending
lightning streaks on me.

365
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:57,401
How can a moon send
lightning streaks?

366
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:05,271
Your face is like the moon and
your looks are like lightning.

367
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:09,681
With every streak,
I wish to lay down my life.

368
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:31,101
The moon has no value
before the sun.

369
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:35,311
I wish to lay down my
life at your feet.

370
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:41,021
No, my dear. You can't die
as long as I'm alive.

371
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:47,651
You're my life now,
my heaven on earth.

372
00:42:49,661 --> 00:42:54,731
It was God's destiny that
I was attracted to you.

373
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:57,131
I too experienced
the same attraction.

374
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:00,701
I feel that we're united
since several births.

375
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,481
Though you're a stranger,
I can't treat you so.

376
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:07,041
This is a miracle of the
nature, the urge to love.

377
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:11,781
I don't even know your name.

378
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:15,951
Even then my heart beats
tell me that...

379
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:24,291
...I know you since ages.
What's your name?

380
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:53,681
Oh! my sweetheart, my life...
- Oh! my Lord, my love...

381
00:43:57,061 --> 00:44:00,831
Won't you ask the name
of your love?

382
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:05,701
No need to ask. There's only
one man in the whole world...

383
00:44:05,971 --> 00:44:07,941
...who can embrace me like this.

384
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:13,141
That can be none other
than my Kaish.

385
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:21,421
Oh God... I wish the
time should stop ticking...

386
00:44:22,321 --> 00:44:25,921
...so that Laila will embrace
me forever like this.

387
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:31,591
Even if I die now, I should
do so at Laila's feet.

388
00:44:32,231 --> 00:44:34,931
May God take my life
before you die.

389
00:44:35,301 --> 00:44:38,571
My Lord, my life's in your life.

390
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:41,911
I've lost you when I was
young and now I've got you back.

391
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:46,941
Oh! God! don't separate us again.

392
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:56,021
"Even if God's angry with me now..."

393
00:44:56,261 --> 00:45:01,491
"Even if God's angry with me now..."

394
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:07,501
"...my heart can never
be away from you"

395
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:13,341
"...my heart can never
be away from you"

396
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:22,071
"Even if my body's destroyed
and there's no life in me..."

397
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:27,681
"Even if my body's destroyed
and there's no life in me..."

398
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:39,471
"...even then my heart will
always be with you"

399
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:48,001
"Even if God's angry with me now..."

400
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:34,021
"The moment your arms
welcome me..."

401
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:39,721
"The moment your arms
welcome me..."

402
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:45,731
"...even a path of fire
can't stop me coming to you"

403
00:46:46,031 --> 00:46:51,301
"...even a path of fire
can't stop me coming to you"

404
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:56,981
"Even if my every
breath aches me..."

405
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:02,611
"Even if my every
breath aches me..."

406
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:08,191
"...my heart can never
be away from you"

407
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:19,421
"Even if God's angry with me now..."

408
00:47:54,731 --> 00:48:03,161
"Let the world put me
to heavy chains"

409
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:09,001
"Let the world put me
to heavy chains"

410
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:14,651
"I'll break them all and
come to you"

411
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:20,381
"I'll break them all and
come to you"

412
00:48:20,491 --> 00:48:25,861
"How much do you bet that
I can do that for you?"

413
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:31,541
"How much do you bet that
I can do that for you?"

414
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:37,171
"My heart can never
be away from you"

415
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:42,681
"My heart can never
be away from you"

416
00:48:42,951 --> 00:48:51,151
"Even if God's angry with me now..."

417
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:56,791
"...my heart can never
be away from you"

418
00:48:57,061 --> 00:49:03,301
"Even if God's angry with me now..."

419
00:49:35,671 --> 00:49:36,721
Open the door...

420
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:53,211
Oh God! Your mercy
knows no bounds.

421
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:58,081
Save me from the difficulty
that has come on me.

422
00:50:00,361 --> 00:50:03,091
Enter this room through the verandah
and open this door quickly.

423
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:05,921
How come you're in this room?

424
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:08,861
Laila madam's not well.
So, I...

425
00:50:09,231 --> 00:50:14,501
You cheat, if it's a lie, then
I'll put you to a deep slumber

426
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:33,781
If you're bored, why don't
you walk in the garden?

427
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:36,681
Why pounce into my room
at odd hours?

428
00:50:36,961 --> 00:50:39,861
No Laila. Actually I saw a dream.

429
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:43,391
Thought, that day's thief was
in my bed?

430
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:46,361
No, I saw that you're unwell.

431
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:51,701
But you're fine here.
I'll go now.

432
00:50:55,141 --> 00:50:59,051
Laila? That Amir Sharwari's
daughter?

433
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:02,221
That clan who were thirsty
for our blood.

434
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:07,321
Yes. The same Laila, for whose love,
I've been craving since ages.

435
00:51:07,561 --> 00:51:10,181
Then Tabrej will quench his
thirst with your blood.

436
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:11,651
And you'll be killed.

437
00:51:11,891 --> 00:51:13,731
I'll become a reality
if I survive...

438
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:15,361
...and a legend if I die.

439
00:51:15,631 --> 00:51:18,961
You can sing this song of love.
We don't need the song of death.

440
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,831
We're going back. Good bye.

441
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:22,871
Cowards, are you scared?

442
00:51:23,171 --> 00:51:25,971
You had sworn to be a
part and parcel of me.

443
00:51:26,311 --> 00:51:28,901
That was our friendship
- And loyalty towards you.

444
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,371
We had the disease
of friendship.

445
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:33,211
This suicide is forbidden
in our religion.

446
00:51:33,551 --> 00:51:35,611
Except in the religion of love.

447
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:39,111
That might be your religion.
- You fall in love all alone...

448
00:51:39,421 --> 00:51:40,621
...and we'll be killed in
that process.

449
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:42,381
Then why don't you also
love someone?

450
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:45,821
Then why don't you link me
with Laila's servant?

451
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:48,891
I won't die a dog's death.
But will live in comfort.

452
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:51,631
But how can all 3 of you
love the same girl?

453
00:51:55,201 --> 00:51:58,661
You should recognize the
one whom you catch.

454
00:51:58,971 --> 00:52:00,441
Then, alone will your
eyes be opened.

455
00:52:00,781 --> 00:52:02,801
I'll recognize them easily.

456
00:52:03,111 --> 00:52:06,671
I've 2 eyes on my face and
10 eyes in these fingers.

457
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:16,121
Is this a garden of fairies?

458
00:52:16,361 --> 00:52:17,991
Or a graveyard for
lovelorns like us?

459
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:32,141
The stoutest of lot is blind.
She needs a support to walk.

460
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:35,541
You blind brat, she has
her arms spread out.

461
00:52:35,851 --> 00:52:38,111
She needs the support of arms.

462
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:39,981
What about my arms?

463
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:42,771
Eh! take care of your fingers
you skinny thing.

464
00:52:56,001 --> 00:53:01,991
I've caught.
It's Nur.

465
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:08,071
Moon is before me.
- She's like the moon on the sky.

466
00:53:08,381 --> 00:53:10,441
I've lots of slaps
with me in store.

467
00:53:16,451 --> 00:53:18,721
Slipper these chimps and
make them bald.

468
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:24,351
I'm experiencing a rain
of shoes for the 1st time.

469
00:53:24,691 --> 00:53:26,161
Salutations Prince...

470
00:54:16,181 --> 00:54:20,141
I'm sorry, your friend
Tabrej is not here.

471
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:22,181
Can I be of some
help to you?

472
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:28,621
Who's this Princess?
- My loving daughter.

473
00:54:28,861 --> 00:54:30,951
Oh God! Save her from evil eyes.

474
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:33,691
I'll call for Tabrej.
Till then you...

475
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:35,061
I'm in a hurry now.

476
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:38,301
Next time I pass from here,
I'll meet Tabrej.

477
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:40,661
Good bye.
- Good bye.

478
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:52,211
Oh God!...

479
00:55:20,811 --> 00:55:24,841
Now we're dressed fully.
- You may open your eyes.

480
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:27,141
And show us your face.

481
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:32,411
I offer my salutations to you all.

482
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:36,921
We also do likewise.
- Is Kaish there inside?

483
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:39,961
No. He has gone out for a stroll.

484
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:41,661
We were also just following him.

485
00:55:41,931 --> 00:55:44,991
Now, why should we go
when heaven has come to us?

486
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:47,391
Please come in.

487
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:54,931
Wow! What a style of walk.
Please sit down.

488
00:56:00,951 --> 00:56:03,581
Tell me, what can I do
for you?

489
00:56:04,091 --> 00:56:08,251
When Kaish will return
tell him that...

490
00:56:08,521 --> 00:56:12,391
...Laila has told that she won't
be able to meet him tonight.

491
00:56:12,761 --> 00:56:15,491
There's a thick security
around the house.

492
00:56:15,801 --> 00:56:17,321
So it's dangerous.

493
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:20,121
We should find ways of
escaping from that danger.

494
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:23,241
I feel, you also don't go
back to the house tonight.

495
00:56:23,511 --> 00:56:25,471
We'll all share this
night together.

496
00:56:26,211 --> 00:56:27,701
What do you mean?

497
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:31,611
From now, till midnight,
I'll serve you.

498
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:34,981
From 12 to 4, I'll serve you
- And from 4 to 6, it's my turn.

499
00:56:35,181 --> 00:56:40,821
Oh! God! I feel it's more
dangerous here than there.

500
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:45,461
But we're waiting for
you since long.

501
00:56:45,661 --> 00:56:48,061
At least tell us your name
before you go.

502
00:56:48,961 --> 00:56:53,261
Jafran.
- But this is his name.

503
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:55,441
So she's your younger sister.

504
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:58,731
Well, what's your father's name?

505
00:56:59,611 --> 00:57:00,911
Kamraj.

506
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:05,981
Congrats. She's your
daughter now.

507
00:57:08,421 --> 00:57:11,411
Your name Sir?
- Mastan.

508
00:57:11,951 --> 00:57:14,291
That's the limit.
This is my uncle's name.

509
00:57:14,591 --> 00:57:18,321
I'm your niece then.
Good bye uncle.

510
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:26,761
Good bye brother,
good bye dad.

511
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:32,671
Oh! my love...

512
00:57:37,851 --> 00:57:38,681
Come, let's go...

513
00:58:32,271 --> 00:58:33,331
Bend down soon.

514
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:55,851
I can't get them married
without her dad's permission.

515
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:57,491
His influence is even
with the King.

516
00:58:57,691 --> 00:59:01,361
And I've influence even
with God. By ready.

517
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:06,801
For what?
- Saw this long chilli?

518
00:59:07,071 --> 00:59:08,041
What'll you do?

519
00:59:08,271 --> 00:59:10,431
I'll push it into your
mouth through your nose...

520
00:59:10,611 --> 00:59:15,871
...so that you may die
in a spicy way.

521
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:17,011
What do you mean?

522
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:21,811
Friends, hold his beard
and raise his nostrils.

523
00:59:22,921 --> 00:59:27,981
I'm reading.
- Hurry up. Read fast.

524
00:59:37,531 --> 00:59:49,071
Laila, your marriage is
fixed with Kaish.

525
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:57,721
Had I known earlier that
he's Amari's dog...

526
00:59:57,951 --> 01:00:04,191
...he wouldn't have been alive
today to bring dishonor to us.

527
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:05,391
Brother...
- Move away.

528
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:09,421
Throw him into the well.

529
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:44,551
Shameless, how could you
be so brave in love?

530
01:01:44,731 --> 01:01:48,631
You're heaving your lover's
name before your parents?

531
01:01:48,961 --> 01:01:53,901
Oh God! a spinster with
a stranger man.

532
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:59,501
Why didn't I die so that
I needn't see this day?

533
01:01:59,711 --> 01:02:03,771
Why curse yourself? She should
have died at her birth.

534
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:08,611
By cheating her family,
she was dating our enemy's son.

535
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:14,051
I wish I could bury her
and her lover alive.

536
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:20,061
Shut up. Dare you utter his
name again, I'll make you dumb.

537
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:24,921
Cowards, my son has
been killed and...

538
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:29,291
...you're alive to give me this
awful news.

539
01:02:29,711 --> 01:02:34,111
As his friend,
why don't you also die?

540
01:02:34,511 --> 01:02:39,411
For being disloyal, from today,
you all aren't free.

541
01:02:39,781 --> 01:02:42,081
You'll live as the slave
of our entire clan.

542
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:44,251
Get lost from here.

543
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:50,761
Brother, Kaish and Laila were
one life in one body.

544
01:02:51,091 --> 01:02:54,391
Only with the life of Kaish, your
thirst for crime won't be quenched.

545
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:56,621
Make me also a victim
of your sword.

546
01:02:56,931 --> 01:02:59,401
Why are you waiting?
Kill me also.

547
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:01,191
No Laila, No.

548
01:03:08,081 --> 01:03:10,541
Leave him, let him go.

549
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:15,671
If he reveals our hideout
then...?

550
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:17,941
He who doesn't know his own
address...

551
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:20,311
...what can he reveal
about us?

552
01:03:58,831 --> 01:04:01,801
Fool, forgot our customs...?

553
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:04,361
...that not to trespass while
Namaz is being performed.

554
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:05,991
Don't you remember even this?

555
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:09,501
Pardon me priest.

556
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:15,681
I neither remember the
world's torture on me...

557
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:17,781
...not my own loyalty.

558
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:21,641
Other than love,
I remember nothing else.

559
01:04:22,181 --> 01:04:24,481
You're blind in love.
Open your divine eyes...

560
01:04:24,621 --> 01:04:25,681
...or else you'll go to hell.

561
01:04:25,921 --> 01:04:28,251
In front of God,
your love has no value.

562
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:34,121
Worship of love is divine.
Love increases by worshipping it.

563
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:37,361
When love reaches its climax...

564
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,621
...it becomes worship
and divine.

565
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:42,331
Yours is just a worship
for namesake.

566
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:45,771
You mean, I don't know
to worship?

567
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:47,541
Don't get annoyed Sir.

568
01:04:47,841 --> 01:04:52,441
In Laila's love when I was
unaware of your Namaz...

569
01:04:52,651 --> 01:04:59,111
...how could you be aware of
my presence while praying?

570
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:05,351
True worship's very tough.

571
01:05:05,631 --> 01:05:10,391
When head is bowed down
with heart full of thoughts...

572
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:15,031
...if, this is worship, then
my love's any day better.

573
01:05:17,341 --> 01:05:20,041
Wait my son,
you're right.

574
01:05:20,581 --> 01:05:22,811
May God forgive me.

575
01:05:25,481 --> 01:05:29,251
Today your love has taught me
the method of worshipping.

576
01:05:58,151 --> 01:06:01,981
Oh! Pir Baba, you are our
only hope, now.

577
01:06:02,481 --> 01:06:05,111
Make my grand daughter well.

578
01:06:26,711 --> 01:06:31,941
"I've come to your doorstep.
I'll do something and go"

579
01:06:32,181 --> 01:06:37,681
"I'll get my wishes fulfilled
or I'll die"

580
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:42,911
"I've come to your doorstep.
I'll do something and go"

581
01:06:43,161 --> 01:06:48,101
"I'll get my wishes fulfilled
or I'll die"

582
01:07:22,201 --> 01:07:37,171
"You know everything and
everyone's agony"

583
01:07:37,411 --> 01:07:42,041
"I entrust all
my problems to you"

584
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:52,251
"I'm a wounded and mad lover"

585
01:07:52,461 --> 01:07:56,861
"Having heard of your miracles
I've come here with great hope"

586
01:07:57,131 --> 01:08:04,131
"I've come to your doorstep.
I'll do something and go"

587
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:09,111
"I'll get my wishes fulfilled
or I'll die"

588
01:08:37,711 --> 01:08:52,521
"My heart's full of sorrow
and my life's barren"

589
01:08:52,691 --> 01:08:57,591
"Let my sight be blessed with
my detached lover"

590
01:08:57,691 --> 01:09:07,591
"Now redeem me of my
sorrows, or let me die"

591
01:09:07,841 --> 01:09:14,041
"When life's tough living
I've come to your doorstep"

592
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:19,581
"I've come to your doorstep.
I'll do something and go"

593
01:09:19,811 --> 01:09:25,151
"I'll get my wishes fulfilled
or I'll die"

594
01:09:25,691 --> 01:09:29,621
"I've come to your doorstep.
I'll do something and go"

595
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:34,561
"I'll get my wishes fulfilled
or I'll die"

596
01:09:44,501 --> 01:09:48,241
I've been calling you
since long.

597
01:09:50,081 --> 01:09:52,071
But so far, I couldn't
get a glimpse of Laila.

598
01:09:52,781 --> 01:09:58,551
I've heard, no devotee goes
out from here...

599
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:00,151
...without his wishes
being cherished.

600
01:10:01,961 --> 01:10:04,821
Oh! the one who satisfies
the wishes of all...

601
01:10:05,131 --> 01:10:08,931
...am I not destined to
be blessed by you?

602
01:10:12,071 --> 01:10:15,131
I'll paint your doorstep
with my blood.

603
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:19,571
I'll lay down my life here only.

604
01:10:40,891 --> 01:10:47,961
"No one has returned from
here with uncherished wishes"

605
01:10:48,071 --> 01:10:53,671
"Wishes of all have
been fulfilled"

606
01:10:54,311 --> 01:10:59,071
"No one has returned from
here with uncherished wishes"

607
01:11:00,781 --> 01:11:02,911
"One who came to you
with their problems..."

608
01:11:03,121 --> 01:11:07,021
"...went back blessing you
as their wishes were fulfilled"

609
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:39,621
"No one has returned from
here with uncherished wishes"

610
01:11:58,311 --> 01:12:07,211
"He who comes to your doorstep
in misery..."

611
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:16,191
"...grant his wishes that he prays for"

612
01:12:17,221 --> 01:12:21,191
"You're an epitome of mercy"

613
01:12:21,191 --> 01:12:23,131
"You rebuild broken houses"

614
01:12:23,331 --> 01:12:26,231
"You're the messenger of God"

615
01:12:26,601 --> 01:12:29,431
"You can wipe off all the sorrow"

616
01:12:35,611 --> 01:12:43,411
"You're merciful with
lovelorn hearts"

617
01:12:45,621 --> 01:12:49,211
"You've saved men from drowning"

618
01:12:54,561 --> 01:12:57,221
"This is your specialty"

619
01:12:57,431 --> 01:13:00,591
"Your mercy's unique"

620
01:13:06,711 --> 01:13:18,481
"You're the abode of
happiness and love"

621
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:21,351
"You're the God of love"

622
01:13:21,661 --> 01:13:24,521
"You're the medicine for
all sorrow"

623
01:13:24,761 --> 01:13:29,221
"That's why all say that..."

624
01:13:29,631 --> 01:13:41,601
"...no one has returned from
here with uncherished wishes"

625
01:13:41,781 --> 01:13:56,621
"He who comes to your doorstep
in misery"

626
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:15,811
"We've seen lovelorn lovers"

627
01:14:24,681 --> 01:14:30,651
"We've seen several
sorrowful faces here"

628
01:14:30,921 --> 01:14:38,261
"We've seen people
living on hope"

629
01:14:41,971 --> 01:14:54,111
"Ever since I've seen you,
you're my God of Gods"

630
01:14:54,451 --> 01:15:06,591
"Even if my life's laid before
you, that too would be less"

631
01:15:07,191 --> 01:15:18,161
"I've found you exactly
as I've heard about you"

632
01:15:18,441 --> 01:15:29,471
"You build our hopes and make us
reach our destinations"

633
01:15:29,751 --> 01:15:32,741
"You give happiness to all"

634
01:15:33,021 --> 01:15:35,151
"You unite dispersed lovers"

635
01:15:35,491 --> 01:15:39,191
"That's why all say that..."

636
01:15:39,461 --> 01:15:55,711
"...no one returns empty-handed
from your doorstep"

637
01:16:20,991 --> 01:16:25,331
When she went, her face was
clouded with sorrow.

638
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,701
But she returned with a
cheerful blooming face.

639
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,991
All is due to the mercy
of Pir Baba.

640
01:16:31,441 --> 01:16:37,311
Showing her lover is no
less than the moon on ld.

641
01:16:37,781 --> 01:16:40,081
But how did he survive
from the death knell?

642
01:16:40,381 --> 01:16:43,981
God alone knows that.
You also think how he escaped.

643
01:16:44,321 --> 01:16:50,281
So far, no one has come alive
from that death knell.

644
01:16:50,521 --> 01:16:52,861
How did Kaish come out alive?

645
01:16:53,591 --> 01:16:57,391
Why did Laila's heart call
out that Kaish is alive?

646
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:02,661
Why did God give life
to Laila today?

647
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:04,631
What do you intend saying?

648
01:17:05,411 --> 01:17:09,471
My Lord, love of Kaish and
Laila has reached God.

649
01:17:10,011 --> 01:17:12,381
God's also involved in it.

650
01:17:12,851 --> 01:17:18,311
To crush such a love is a
crime and sin also.

651
01:17:18,921 --> 01:17:23,181
Make Kaish your son-in-law
and put an end to all enmity.

652
01:17:29,431 --> 01:17:34,591
There's no music when Amir
and Sharwari come together.

653
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:37,371
Only swords cling there.

654
01:17:40,011 --> 01:17:41,801
This Amri sword is thirsty
to drink your blood.

655
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:43,841
You've killed my son.

656
01:17:47,551 --> 01:17:51,811
You old man, I don't wish
to kill you.

657
01:17:56,121 --> 01:17:59,991
I've no intention to live
after my son's death.

658
01:18:00,361 --> 01:18:02,521
Today you'll live or I.

659
01:18:18,081 --> 01:18:24,811
Old man, I spare you today.
But in future...

660
01:18:25,721 --> 01:18:28,981
...don't dare to challenge
the Sharwari sword.

661
01:18:45,323 --> 01:18:48,023
Father...
- Kaish, my son, you're alive?

662
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:52,593
Father, is this your plight?

663
01:18:53,063 --> 01:18:57,733
Death was lurking over your head.
God gave it to me.

664
01:18:57,973 --> 01:19:05,673
No father, No.
- Accept my salutations, God.

665
01:19:05,843 --> 01:19:12,303
Save my Kaish.

666
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:31,263
From today, you'll be under
strict vigilance...

667
01:20:31,703 --> 01:20:34,633
...so that you'll never be able
to meet Kaish in your life.

668
01:20:35,033 --> 01:20:37,523
Man can't see God in
his life, father.

669
01:20:37,973 --> 01:20:42,413
Even then, man, till he dies,
keeps worshipping God.

670
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:45,113
You've given the status of
God to Kaish?

671
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:50,343
Not the status of God,
but his face sparkles with divinity.

672
01:20:50,713 --> 01:20:54,053
Then I wish to bow down
before him with devotion.

673
01:20:54,323 --> 01:20:59,423
It's a sin to worship humans.
Religion doesn't permit this.

674
01:20:59,723 --> 01:21:06,963
Love is my religion. To bow
down is like worshipping love.

675
01:21:07,263 --> 01:21:11,173
My child, I was testing your love.

676
01:21:11,543 --> 01:21:15,303
Even a priest has said
that after God...

677
01:21:15,513 --> 01:21:18,603
...if anyone is worth
prostrating...

678
01:21:18,813 --> 01:21:22,873
...then that's a husband.

679
01:21:22,983 --> 01:21:26,583
Don't worry. Kaish alone
will be your husband.

680
01:22:24,643 --> 01:22:29,603
Send the servants everywhere...

681
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:37,893
...to bring Kaish with honor
here. Go soon without gaping.

682
01:23:01,013 --> 01:23:09,753
Father...
- What's wrong with my son?

683
01:23:09,993 --> 01:23:11,083
What happened, Tabrej?

684
01:23:15,433 --> 01:23:17,993
Revenge of murder is murder.

685
01:23:18,363 --> 01:23:23,133
Tabrej killed the father of Kaish
and Kaish killed Tabrej.

686
01:23:23,433 --> 01:23:26,803
The law gives a death sentence
to the culprit.

687
01:23:27,243 --> 01:23:29,363
But on grounds of justice...

688
01:23:29,573 --> 01:23:32,673
...the emotions of a son should
be considered...

689
01:23:33,043 --> 01:23:38,043
Anyone in place of Kaish
would've done the same.

690
01:23:38,353 --> 01:23:41,343
So, I'll be sympathetic
with you, Kaish.

691
01:23:41,693 --> 01:23:44,523
Instead of a death sentence
you'll be extradited.

692
01:23:44,793 --> 01:23:47,523
Leave my country and go
away for ever.

693
01:23:47,863 --> 01:23:50,663
This is injustice, Oh! Lord.
Give me a death sentence.

694
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:54,133
But don't give me such
a strict punishment.

695
01:23:54,433 --> 01:23:57,803
Are you mad?
I'm saving your life.

696
01:23:58,073 --> 01:24:00,733
You treat it more severe than
a death sentence.

697
01:24:01,003 --> 01:24:03,303
You're not giving me life,
Oh! king.

698
01:24:03,613 --> 01:24:06,083
But after snatching
my life from me...

699
01:24:06,283 --> 01:24:07,743
...you're ordering me
to stay alive.

700
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:14,983
Give me death but I can't
live away from Laila.

701
01:24:15,253 --> 01:24:16,653
Who's this Laila?

702
01:24:16,853 --> 01:24:21,623
She's my daughter,
honor of the Sharwari family.

703
01:24:21,933 --> 01:24:24,833
He's hell bent on
maligning her name.

704
01:24:25,063 --> 01:24:28,223
Absolutely wrong.
Laila's my objective in life.

705
01:24:28,433 --> 01:24:29,523
She's my heaven.

706
01:24:29,733 --> 01:24:34,763
How can I leave this heaven and go,
where my Laila's staying?

707
01:24:35,013 --> 01:24:39,643
I'll serve her all my life.
I'll either attain her...

708
01:24:39,813 --> 01:24:42,473
...or die at her feet.

709
01:24:42,853 --> 01:24:45,373
I haven't seen such a
violent lover all my life.

710
01:24:45,623 --> 01:24:49,353
His love is a legend.
What a wonderful lover is he.

711
01:24:49,553 --> 01:24:53,113
His actions have made life
miserable for us.

712
01:24:53,323 --> 01:24:55,053
Get rid of him.

713
01:24:55,263 --> 01:24:59,223
Throw this man out of
our territory.

714
01:24:59,463 --> 01:25:05,263
If he's spotted here again,
beat him with stones, then.

715
01:25:05,473 --> 01:25:09,233
Even then, if he refuses to
go, chop off his head.

716
01:25:25,993 --> 01:25:30,553
My childhood friend Tabrej
has been murdered.

717
01:25:31,093 --> 01:25:34,723
So, I don't relish alcohol.

718
01:25:35,903 --> 01:25:41,533
If you refuse to drink,
give me a chance to serve you.

719
01:25:41,973 --> 01:25:46,143
I'll wipe out all your
sorrow in my embrace.

720
01:25:55,023 --> 01:26:01,453
I've heard that you'll be
crowned on 25th.

721
01:26:03,193 --> 01:26:08,563
Whose luck's going to click
amidst the girls of the Harem?

722
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:13,963
Whom do you intend
making your queen?

723
01:26:22,413 --> 01:26:29,683
I've decided that my friend
Tabrej's sister will be my bride.

724
01:26:30,153 --> 01:26:32,493
That's God's wish also.

725
01:26:32,693 --> 01:26:36,463
Amir Sharwari and his wife are
waiting to see you.

726
01:26:36,833 --> 01:26:40,823
What luck! Go soon and bring
them here with honor.

727
01:26:41,133 --> 01:26:42,163
Yes, My Lord...

728
01:26:42,633 --> 01:26:47,503
I've heard this and you too
should hear...

729
01:26:47,773 --> 01:26:52,943
...what people are gossiping about.
- Is it Tabrej's sister?

730
01:26:53,183 --> 01:26:59,143
All tongues wag of Laila
Majnu's love affair.

731
01:26:59,553 --> 01:27:03,183
If I rely on your words...

732
01:27:03,523 --> 01:27:07,083
...what's the difference between
you and the gossipers?

733
01:27:07,523 --> 01:27:11,823
Is it possible for a decent girl...

734
01:27:12,003 --> 01:27:14,523
...to fall in love with a boy
who has killed her brother?

735
01:27:14,733 --> 01:27:16,493
But my Lord,
this is not a rumor.

736
01:27:16,703 --> 01:27:23,073
I heard that Majnu openly
expressed his love for Laila.

737
01:27:23,343 --> 01:27:26,473
This is a one sided love.
How is she at fault?

738
01:27:26,743 --> 01:27:29,643
Her innocent beauty
is at fault.

739
01:27:29,883 --> 01:27:34,253
One look at her made
me fall in love with her.

740
01:27:34,623 --> 01:27:37,553
An ordinary man can also
go mad for her.

741
01:28:08,523 --> 01:28:30,403
"The girl's ready to accept
the punishment for her love"

742
01:28:30,743 --> 01:28:49,063
"Don't beat my lover
with stones"

743
01:28:49,233 --> 01:28:54,603
"Please don't harass my
lover so much"

744
01:28:55,173 --> 01:29:06,043
"Don't beat my lover
with stones"

745
01:29:24,063 --> 01:29:46,113
"He's not in his senses.
At least you all come to your senses"

746
01:29:46,353 --> 01:29:57,763
"He's badly wounded
and hurt with sorrow"

747
01:29:57,763 --> 01:30:08,603
"Don't incur God's wrath
he's indeed vulnerable"

748
01:30:08,843 --> 01:30:19,613
"Why have you come to
hurt a wounded weakling?"

749
01:30:20,053 --> 01:30:34,563
"Don't beat my lover
with stones"

750
01:31:09,433 --> 01:31:17,743
"He has turned mad
due to my love"

751
01:31:23,383 --> 01:31:34,313
"I'm a culprit for making
this sane man insane"

752
01:31:34,693 --> 01:31:45,693
"Crucify me or burn me alive"

753
01:31:45,943 --> 01:31:56,783
"I've no grievances. Give me
any punishment as you wish"

754
01:31:57,013 --> 01:32:07,793
"Spare him his life. I'm ready
to lay my life instead"

755
01:32:08,093 --> 01:32:22,373
"Don't beat my lover
with stones"

756
01:32:56,843 --> 01:33:07,513
"Love can turn even
stones into flowers"

757
01:33:07,823 --> 01:33:18,423
"It can be proved before
one and all"

758
01:33:18,703 --> 01:33:29,633
"Oh! men of the world,
pick up the stones"

759
01:33:29,913 --> 01:33:40,543
"I'll face you and
you'll face me"

760
01:33:41,123 --> 01:33:59,733
"I pray to God to
reform things here"

761
01:33:59,943 --> 01:34:14,483
"Don't beat my lover
with stones"

762
01:34:38,733 --> 01:34:43,673
"This culprit has refused
to obey the order of the king"

763
01:34:44,143 --> 01:34:46,073
Chop off his head.

764
01:34:46,443 --> 01:34:50,603
I give a word that Kaish
will obey the orders of the king.

765
01:34:50,913 --> 01:34:52,433
He'll leave this town
and go away.

766
01:34:57,753 --> 01:35:05,383
No king can compel me to
leave my Laila and go away.

767
01:35:05,563 --> 01:35:07,323
Don't be stubborn.
Go away Kaish.

768
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:08,423
No Laila.

769
01:35:08,593 --> 01:35:11,763
You should go or else
I'll die before you.

770
01:35:11,963 --> 01:35:15,563
I swear, if you refuse to
leave this place and go...

771
01:35:15,773 --> 01:35:17,203
...you'll only see my
dead body then.

772
01:35:20,403 --> 01:35:23,003
Don't punish me
like this, Laila.

773
01:35:23,313 --> 01:35:29,743
I swore and the world
has heard that.

774
01:35:29,983 --> 01:35:32,973
Our love's put to a test now.

775
01:35:33,223 --> 01:35:39,053
Honor my words if you
wish or else refuse it.

776
01:35:44,303 --> 01:35:45,853
Love is my religion.

777
01:35:46,403 --> 01:35:50,303
It would be improper to
break the lover's promise.

778
01:35:52,543 --> 01:35:58,133
I'm going with all my
uncherished ambitions.

779
01:36:07,723 --> 01:36:12,123
Don't be so depressed
my Lord. Laila's yours.

780
01:36:12,593 --> 01:36:14,723
She'll be yours till she dies.

781
01:36:15,793 --> 01:36:18,163
I'll also be waiting for
you till I die.

782
01:36:20,233 --> 01:36:22,603
How long can this world
stop us from meeting?

783
01:36:28,273 --> 01:36:31,943
I promise, we'll surely meet.

784
01:36:35,253 --> 01:36:36,773
Good bye.

785
01:36:46,493 --> 01:36:48,423
I've got the news that
prince Bahksh...

786
01:36:48,633 --> 01:36:51,393
...has gone to marry Amiri
Sharwari's daughter Laila.

787
01:36:51,663 --> 01:36:53,063
You mean that Laila of Majnu?

788
01:36:53,263 --> 01:36:56,633
Yes. He'll be returning with
lots of riches from there.

789
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:58,503
He'll be staying in a
tent on his way.

790
01:36:58,673 --> 01:37:01,103
Then it will be a good
chance for us.

791
01:37:01,413 --> 01:37:04,573
We'll keep the riches and...

792
01:37:04,913 --> 01:37:10,813
...handover Laila to Majnu.

793
01:37:28,133 --> 01:37:31,573
Not only the king,
even if I get God...

794
01:37:31,703 --> 01:37:34,173
...I won't accept Bahksh
as my husband.

795
01:37:35,843 --> 01:37:40,473
If you refuse to marry,
then remember...

796
01:37:40,783 --> 01:37:44,243
...you'll incur this mother's curse.

797
01:37:44,923 --> 01:37:47,083
You'll go to hell then.

798
01:37:47,553 --> 01:37:50,493
Heaven or hell is decided
after death, mother.

799
01:37:50,763 --> 01:37:54,323
Don't throw me into hell
while I'm alive.

800
01:37:54,533 --> 01:37:58,363
If I marry a man other than Kaish
life will become hell for me.

801
01:37:58,663 --> 01:38:00,363
Shut up you impertinent.

802
01:38:00,633 --> 01:38:04,263
The sinner who killed my son,...

803
01:38:04,573 --> 01:38:07,593
...he whose hands are stained
with your brother's blood...

804
01:38:07,773 --> 01:38:12,213
...do you wish to marry
such a person?

805
01:38:12,613 --> 01:38:18,343
Prince Bahksh, do you wish
to marry Laila...

806
01:38:18,623 --> 01:38:24,953
...for one lakh dinar?

807
01:38:25,223 --> 01:38:28,063
Do you agree ?
- Yes

808
01:38:32,303 --> 01:38:40,003
Laila, do you agree to marry
prince Bahksh...

809
01:38:40,243 --> 01:38:46,613
...for one lakh dinar.
Do you agree ?

810
01:38:48,153 --> 01:38:52,143
Say yes, my dear.
- Do you agree?

811
01:38:52,483 --> 01:38:54,453
For God's sake, don't refuse.

812
01:38:59,893 --> 01:39:03,763
Say yes.
- I swear on Kaish.

813
01:39:04,303 --> 01:39:08,933
If you refuse,
you'll see Kaish dead.

814
01:39:09,103 --> 01:39:14,373
Yes.

815
01:40:11,903 --> 01:40:31,483
"Take the good wishes of a man
who's destroyed in his love"

816
01:40:31,783 --> 01:40:41,683
"Take the wishes of a
broken heart with you"

817
01:40:42,293 --> 01:40:52,333
"Take the good wishes of a man
who's destroyed in his love"

818
01:41:20,103 --> 01:41:39,883
"May you go unhurt by
scorching heat in your path"

819
01:41:40,183 --> 01:42:00,103
"Take the tearful cloud of the
lover's eyes with you"

820
01:42:27,733 --> 01:42:52,323
"My heart wishes you happiness
in your life"

821
01:42:52,593 --> 01:43:12,243
"If these wishes are less, my
blood of love's there for you"

822
01:43:40,373 --> 01:44:00,253
"I'm punished with isolation
as a crime for falling in love"

823
01:44:00,593 --> 01:44:19,503
"Take those wishes with you"

824
01:45:43,123 --> 01:45:45,823
I wished to raise the veil
from your face.

825
01:45:46,533 --> 01:45:50,053
But I'm shocked to see...

826
01:45:50,263 --> 01:45:53,233
...that it's raised before
I entered.

827
01:45:53,433 --> 01:45:55,133
So that the secret will be
disclosed...

828
01:45:55,373 --> 01:45:57,843
...and you can know the reality.

829
01:45:58,243 --> 01:45:59,533
I know it, queen.

830
01:45:59,913 --> 01:46:04,473
I've seen that loafer Majnu's
foolishness with my own eyes.

831
01:46:04,943 --> 01:46:09,313
If Islam knew no mercy...

832
01:46:09,553 --> 01:46:13,613
...then I would've cut off
his head in the desert itself.

833
01:46:14,653 --> 01:46:16,093
Why are you shivering?

834
01:46:18,923 --> 01:46:23,993
Where are you lost?
You shivered because...

835
01:46:24,233 --> 01:46:27,223
...I was talking of Majnu's
head being chopped off.

836
01:46:28,433 --> 01:46:29,263
Yes.

837
01:46:30,203 --> 01:46:31,973
I can understand your problem.

838
01:46:32,473 --> 01:46:39,383
Any decent girl won't like her name
being linked with a loafer.

839
01:46:40,113 --> 01:46:45,283
These rumors will be
buried once you're my queen.

840
01:46:46,053 --> 01:46:49,613
You'll be respected
everywhere in my rule.

841
01:46:50,163 --> 01:46:53,223
You'll command respect
as my queen.

842
01:46:55,963 --> 01:47:01,493
These trembling hands show that
you're very delicate.

843
01:47:02,273 --> 01:47:08,763
As a bride, you're unaware
of today's night.

844
01:47:10,213 --> 01:47:12,343
I'll teach you, my love.

845
01:47:12,713 --> 01:47:15,913
You wished to disclose
a secret with me.

846
01:47:16,683 --> 01:47:19,853
In turn, I'll disclose a
few secrets with you.

847
01:47:20,053 --> 01:47:20,853
Just listen...

848
01:47:21,193 --> 01:47:23,183
Before you make me hear
your heart beats...

849
01:47:23,493 --> 01:47:25,753
...we've become one forever.

850
01:47:26,123 --> 01:47:30,083
Come close to me.
- First listen to me, O king!

851
01:47:30,433 --> 01:47:32,833
Don't control yourself my love.

852
01:47:32,973 --> 01:47:35,563
This is a lovely night
of tingling urges.

853
01:47:35,803 --> 01:47:38,403
Today is our first night.

854
01:47:40,143 --> 01:47:42,803
Will you like to have your
first night with a corpse?

855
01:47:43,383 --> 01:47:51,543
What do you mean?
- Yes, I'm a living corpse.

856
01:47:52,583 --> 01:47:55,713
Only life's there and
a will to live remains.

857
01:47:57,323 --> 01:48:00,293
You can take my body
in the form of a corpse.

858
01:48:00,733 --> 01:48:02,963
But you can never
attain a place in my heart.

859
01:48:03,203 --> 01:48:06,963
So, this was the secret you
wanted to tell me.

860
01:48:07,303 --> 01:48:13,763
Those rumors were true then,
I can't believe it.

861
01:48:14,113 --> 01:48:17,133
How can you love your
brother's killer?

862
01:48:17,443 --> 01:48:20,503
If you loved him,
why did you marry me?

863
01:48:29,893 --> 01:48:35,663
You made me swear on Laila
and separated me from her.

864
01:48:36,863 --> 01:48:40,263
You entrusted this poor man's
lover to a king.

865
01:48:40,603 --> 01:48:46,163
I swear, once again Kaish and
Laila will meet each other.

866
01:48:46,673 --> 01:48:49,273
You may take her far
away from me.

867
01:48:49,743 --> 01:48:53,373
Now I've these legs
of Laila to walk.

868
01:48:53,783 --> 01:48:56,153
These are my hands
to fondle Laila.

869
01:48:56,483 --> 01:48:59,143
These are my breaths
to die at Laila's feet.

870
01:48:59,483 --> 01:49:04,653
Even nature will bow
down before our love.

871
01:49:04,963 --> 01:49:10,693
You can't put my love
into the arms of a king.

872
01:49:11,133 --> 01:49:15,593
Till you crave to be
embraced by me...

873
01:49:15,933 --> 01:49:21,403
...I won't even touch you.
This is my promise.

874
01:49:21,813 --> 01:49:26,303
Had I known earlier
about your love...

875
01:49:26,613 --> 01:49:29,383
...I would never have
married you.

876
01:49:31,123 --> 01:49:34,243
Self respect means
more than my life.

877
01:49:34,623 --> 01:49:40,083
You're my wife now.
I can't tolerate anymore...

878
01:49:40,333 --> 01:49:43,393
...another man in your heart.

879
01:49:44,263 --> 01:49:46,203
Till I throw him out
of your heart...

880
01:49:46,503 --> 01:49:51,273
...I won't be at peace.
- This is impossible.

881
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:53,703
I've never accepted
defeat in my life.

882
01:49:54,073 --> 01:49:59,943
Such a big king unable to
win over his wife's heart.

883
01:50:00,383 --> 01:50:03,313
What a shame will it be on me?

884
01:50:03,683 --> 01:50:06,673
Today the love that's
bubbling in your heart...

885
01:50:06,993 --> 01:50:10,823
...will one day get dissolved
in the ocean of my heart.

886
01:51:26,573 --> 01:51:29,533
Majnu is a real eccentric.

887
01:51:31,143 --> 01:51:33,663
Laugh to your heart's
content at me...

888
01:51:37,343 --> 01:51:44,113
Just tell me, where's my Laila?
How's she now?

889
01:51:44,353 --> 01:51:47,723
You mad man, she's not yours.
Forget her.

890
01:51:47,923 --> 01:51:49,753
That day she saved
you from a shower of stones.

891
01:51:50,093 --> 01:51:55,553
She has forgotten you and
has married our prince.

892
01:51:55,933 --> 01:51:58,363
Not by forgetting me...

893
01:51:58,603 --> 01:52:02,263
...she would've married him
due to some compulsions.

894
01:52:02,473 --> 01:52:06,303
Shut up. There's no
compulsion in a wedding.

895
01:52:06,573 --> 01:52:09,173
Man agrees to marry on his own.

896
01:52:09,443 --> 01:52:15,353
For crown and power any girl
will desert a man like you.

897
01:52:17,523 --> 01:52:23,353
Why do you believe in God?
Answer me.

898
01:52:26,263 --> 01:52:29,023
Have you seen Him anytime?

899
01:52:29,363 --> 01:52:33,493
God can't be seen,
but He's to be believed.

900
01:52:33,903 --> 01:52:38,033
We believe in His mercy.

901
01:52:38,403 --> 01:52:41,963
I also am unaware
of Laila's problems.

902
01:52:42,243 --> 01:52:48,773
As much as you believe in God,
I believe in Laila's love.

903
01:52:51,123 --> 01:52:55,183
Let the crown and riches
lure Laila...

904
01:52:55,523 --> 01:52:59,483
...she's mine and will remain
so till I die.

905
01:53:29,823 --> 01:53:31,523
Allow her to rest.

906
01:53:52,483 --> 01:53:59,753
Are you tired physically
or mentally?

907
01:54:01,323 --> 01:54:02,723
Who are you?

908
01:54:03,053 --> 01:54:10,293
She's Zarina. She's a
servant in the harem...

909
01:54:10,403 --> 01:54:14,393
...sparkling like diamond.

910
01:54:14,773 --> 01:54:20,303
From today, you'll take
care of Laila.

911
01:54:20,813 --> 01:54:23,273
Give her all the comforts.

912
01:54:23,583 --> 01:54:26,603
Try to keep her happy...

913
01:54:26,783 --> 01:54:28,843
...so that she'll forget soon
the sorrow of leaving her parents.

914
01:54:29,083 --> 01:54:34,313
You mean only parents?

915
01:54:34,553 --> 01:54:40,983
Zarina, remember henceforth,
that Laila is my wife.

916
01:54:41,293 --> 01:54:44,293
After my crowning ceremony,
she'll be the queen.

917
01:54:44,563 --> 01:54:47,503
You shouldn't utter any
indecent word against her.

918
01:54:50,573 --> 01:54:55,373
As you say, Sir.
- You also keep a watch that...

919
01:54:55,673 --> 01:55:01,943
...Laila doesn't make a move
that would disgrace me...

920
01:55:02,353 --> 01:55:11,093
I've lost my own confidence.
Hope I try to keep up yours.

921
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:31,033
Oh! the one who's watching fun
from far away...

922
01:55:31,343 --> 01:55:36,713
...isn't there a messenger to take
my message to Laila?

923
01:55:53,233 --> 01:55:56,463
When asked for sympathy,
man gave me brick bats.

924
01:55:57,173 --> 01:56:00,763
They treat me like a mad man,
a lunatic.

925
01:56:01,513 --> 01:56:05,533
Even you're the same. Will you
pass my message to Laila?

926
01:56:07,013 --> 01:56:09,953
"When you go before my lover..."

927
01:56:10,123 --> 01:56:16,543
"...bow down gently
before that beauty"

928
01:56:17,163 --> 01:56:20,893
"If you can't convey all news,
reveal them through your eyes..."

929
01:56:21,263 --> 01:56:25,533
"...my each and every agony"

930
01:56:28,773 --> 01:56:42,743
"Tell her that your lover's
breathing your name"

931
01:56:42,983 --> 01:56:52,553
"He writes your name on the
ground and bows to that"

932
01:56:52,963 --> 01:56:59,193
"He writes your name on the
ground and bows to that"

933
01:57:13,913 --> 01:57:30,563
"With torn and tattered clothes
he's roaming on deserted roads"

934
01:57:40,103 --> 01:57:50,173
"He hugs shadows and calls
out to them as Laila"

935
01:57:50,483 --> 01:57:59,523
"He writes your name on the
ground and bows to that"

936
01:58:11,843 --> 01:58:37,493
"He has forgotten himself,
but not your thoughts"

937
01:58:37,863 --> 01:58:48,033
"All the wounds in his heart
reveal your name"

938
01:58:48,343 --> 01:59:04,023
"He writes your name on the
ground and bows to that"

939
01:59:14,433 --> 01:59:51,863
"Tell my lover that Laila's
your property"

940
01:59:52,173 --> 02:00:02,053
"I'll breathe my last in
his arms"

941
02:00:02,283 --> 02:00:10,783
"All the wounds of my
heart reveal your name"

942
02:00:11,493 --> 02:00:44,123
"My salutations to this deer
for bringing your message"

943
02:00:44,593 --> 02:01:10,413
"My love, my God you still
love me more than your life"

944
02:01:58,463 --> 02:02:00,723
Eat something, my friend.

945
02:02:02,133 --> 02:02:10,203
I'm the one who saved
you from your death.

946
02:02:10,743 --> 02:02:17,243
I'm your well wisher.
I can't see this plight of yours.

947
02:02:21,353 --> 02:02:23,083
What will you see my condition?

948
02:02:25,393 --> 02:02:29,153
I'll make you and Laila meet.

949
02:02:29,863 --> 02:02:35,423
Just tell me, does Laila
have a good friend...

950
02:02:35,663 --> 02:02:37,963
...who'll support your love?

951
02:02:39,233 --> 02:02:41,403
Laila's servant Gulbadan
is there.

952
02:02:41,603 --> 02:02:45,303
Then write a letter to Laila
and ask for her reply...

953
02:02:45,573 --> 02:02:49,343
...when she can meet
you in private.

954
02:02:49,743 --> 02:02:53,243
You write a letter. The rest
is my responsibility.

955
02:02:53,523 --> 02:02:57,653
Very soon, you'll get
to meet Laila.

956
02:02:59,993 --> 02:03:03,053
You're indeed a
messenger of God.

957
02:03:03,263 --> 02:03:07,223
Treat him as our own.
Take him inside...

958
02:03:07,403 --> 02:03:08,893
...and give him writing
material to write a letter.

959
02:03:14,303 --> 02:03:17,243
Do you really intend to
entrust Laila with Majnu?

960
02:03:17,573 --> 02:03:22,773
I would've done, as Kaish
will be just for namesake...

961
02:03:23,013 --> 02:03:27,283
...to bring Laila out of
the palace.

962
02:03:27,623 --> 02:03:28,643
After that...

963
02:03:30,593 --> 02:03:35,423
Do you see this blind eye
and my ugly face?

964
02:03:36,863 --> 02:03:40,093
The enemy who spoilt
my face...

965
02:03:40,363 --> 02:03:46,233
...I'll malign his honor,
only then will I get peace...

966
02:03:46,503 --> 02:03:51,203
...when Laila will become
my slave.

967
02:03:51,573 --> 02:03:56,203
I've brought a news that
would soothe your heart.

968
02:03:56,413 --> 02:04:00,213
Is it a message of death?

969
02:04:00,423 --> 02:04:02,543
God forbid, this news...

970
02:04:05,753 --> 02:04:08,953
You all can go,
the queen says.

971
02:04:09,223 --> 02:04:20,193
You may also go.
But give that letter and go.

972
02:04:20,373 --> 02:04:23,243
Which letter?

973
02:04:33,113 --> 02:04:34,983
Letter of Kaish.

974
02:04:36,793 --> 02:04:38,783
Your servant has
cheated me.

975
02:04:39,123 --> 02:04:43,353
I don't want my queen
also to cheat me.

976
02:04:43,833 --> 02:04:50,753
You can reply this letter and
I'll personally give Kaish.

977
02:04:51,633 --> 02:04:52,763
Read...

978
02:05:43,923 --> 02:05:52,423
Take it...
- Won't your reply?

979
02:05:54,103 --> 02:05:58,463
I've replied.
Kaish will understand.

980
02:06:18,593 --> 02:06:20,683
The reply's there in
this letter only.

981
02:06:22,763 --> 02:06:27,823
Tell Kaish that
I swear on God...

982
02:06:28,103 --> 02:06:31,433
...that I'll convert Laila's
tears into her laughter.

983
02:06:32,603 --> 02:06:34,163
Now a request for Kaish.

984
02:06:34,743 --> 02:06:37,973
Henceforth don't attempt
to write to or meet Laila.

985
02:06:38,343 --> 02:06:40,833
If he disobeys a
husband's request...

986
02:06:41,083 --> 02:06:45,573
...then he'll have to face
a king's move. Release him.

987
02:06:54,023 --> 02:06:57,083
A king's strength can make
a culprit bow down.

988
02:06:57,633 --> 02:07:01,653
But it can't enforce control
on two hearts in love.

989
02:07:02,263 --> 02:07:07,463
God alone can turn
tears into laughter.

990
02:07:07,743 --> 02:07:15,203
I've sworn on my God.
If I fail to fulfil it...

991
02:07:15,583 --> 02:07:19,983
...I'll not only leave my
crown but also this world.

992
02:07:21,583 --> 02:07:25,493
What's the news?

993
02:07:25,823 --> 02:07:29,593
Request of Kaish has been
drowned in tears.

994
02:07:40,973 --> 02:07:42,733
What do you know
about the value of tears.

995
02:07:44,013 --> 02:07:45,273
They are the pearls of love.

996
02:07:46,143 --> 02:07:50,873
They need no one's permission.

997
02:07:51,083 --> 02:07:54,313
They're revealed in the eyes.

998
02:07:59,453 --> 02:08:01,053
These few drops of tears...

999
02:08:01,263 --> 02:08:04,023
...reveal the incapability
and weakness of Laila.

1000
02:08:06,693 --> 02:08:12,433
Kaish has received your
message and he's coming.

1001
02:08:34,093 --> 02:08:36,753
Please go and
leave me alone.

1002
02:09:13,833 --> 02:09:15,523
Forgot your promise?

1003
02:09:16,433 --> 02:09:21,233
With this beauty of yours,
man can become insane.

1004
02:09:22,403 --> 02:09:24,233
Release me from that promise.

1005
02:09:25,373 --> 02:09:29,573
I say, my own heart's not
in my control...

1006
02:09:29,783 --> 02:09:32,143
...and my body's under
the control of a king.

1007
02:09:32,513 --> 02:09:33,813
At present not as a king...

1008
02:09:34,053 --> 02:09:36,353
...but I've come as a
slave of your beauty...

1009
02:09:36,653 --> 02:09:39,483
...that's reflected by my eyes.

1010
02:09:40,823 --> 02:09:47,493
Release me O Queen.
I can't break my promise.

1011
02:09:48,003 --> 02:09:50,493
I can't fulfil it also.

1012
02:09:51,373 --> 02:09:55,273
Your beauty's torturing me
day and night.

1013
02:09:55,473 --> 02:09:57,873
Tell me,
how long should I wait.

1014
02:09:58,443 --> 02:10:00,433
Just look at yourself.

1015
02:10:00,883 --> 02:10:03,843
You're dripping of beauty
from head to toe.

1016
02:10:04,183 --> 02:10:07,413
Why entertain hatred
in your heart then?

1017
02:10:07,783 --> 02:10:18,723
Give me permission to melt
your heart with my love.

1018
02:10:20,433 --> 02:10:22,493
A king bows down
before you, Laila.

1019
02:10:23,563 --> 02:10:27,363
Either permit me to
take you or make me blind...

1020
02:10:27,673 --> 02:10:32,003
...so that your beauty
won't make my eyes restless.

1021
02:10:33,713 --> 02:10:39,243
If you're so eager to
attain me...

1022
02:10:40,923 --> 02:10:49,383
...then where do I have the
strength to stop you? Take me.

1023
02:10:49,923 --> 02:10:54,093
O Queen, come into my arms.

1024
02:11:11,213 --> 02:11:15,343
I'm sorry, my medicines
have no effect on her.

1025
02:11:16,123 --> 02:11:18,883
I've removed the toxic
effect of the poison.

1026
02:11:19,393 --> 02:11:24,793
In spite of it,
her pulse is sinking.

1027
02:11:25,193 --> 02:11:30,393
Then God's prayer should
be resorted to now.

1028
02:11:31,133 --> 02:11:34,363
Till my Queen becomes well...

1029
02:11:35,043 --> 02:11:37,973
...I'll read Quran in
the Mosque.

1030
02:11:42,443 --> 02:11:45,643
Listen to this Royal
announcement.

1031
02:11:45,883 --> 02:11:48,143
All citizens are hereby
informed that...

1032
02:11:48,383 --> 02:11:54,983
...Queen Laila is seriously ill.
So it's the King's request...

1033
02:11:55,163 --> 02:11:58,353
...that after every Namaz
in all Mosques...

1034
02:11:58,533 --> 02:12:01,503
...we should pray for her
recovery and long life...

1035
02:12:01,663 --> 02:12:04,933
...and maintain fast
to attain our wish from God.

1036
02:12:05,073 --> 02:12:08,563
Tomorrow there'll be a
prayer for the Queen in Palace.

1037
02:12:08,743 --> 02:12:14,703
So all priests should
come and pray for her.

1038
02:12:14,883 --> 02:12:20,473
This is a royal request.

1039
02:12:40,943 --> 02:12:45,903
Oh! devotees of God, pray
for the recovery of Queen.

1040
02:13:02,263 --> 02:13:12,463
"When Kaish is alive,
Laila can't die"

1041
02:13:14,543 --> 02:13:38,763
"To prove this to the world,
you should come"

1042
02:13:38,933 --> 02:13:57,273
"This is the request of a
mad lover. So fulfil it"

1043
02:14:05,653 --> 02:14:20,523
"How can I return from your
doorstep with uncherished hopes"

1044
02:14:20,773 --> 02:14:31,873
"You're my God of Gods"

1045
02:14:32,083 --> 02:14:55,393
"Come to redeem me of
my sorrow"

1046
02:14:56,043 --> 02:15:02,773
"This is the request of a
mad lover. So fulfil it"

1047
02:15:16,663 --> 02:15:36,973
"I give you a promise
on my love"

1048
02:15:37,143 --> 02:15:48,653
"I give you a promise
on my sincere love"

1049
02:15:48,793 --> 02:16:05,973
"Come to show the world
about your sincerity"

1050
02:16:08,643 --> 02:16:26,483
"This is the request of a
mad lover. So fulfil it"

1051
02:17:03,003 --> 02:17:14,243
"Let me bow and pray so
that you come before me"

1052
02:17:14,443 --> 02:17:36,893
"I pray with devotion so
that you come before me"

1053
02:17:37,203 --> 02:17:54,573
"Come to relieve me of
my agony"

1054
02:17:55,823 --> 02:18:15,333
"This is the request of a
mad lover. So fulfil it"

1055
02:18:37,093 --> 02:18:44,763
Chop off his head.
- No, Kaish...

1056
02:18:46,603 --> 02:18:49,873
Wait, O Minister...
I feel that...

1057
02:18:50,143 --> 02:18:51,973
...when the Queen's sick...

1058
02:18:52,213 --> 02:18:54,443
...it would be improper
to indulge in bloodshed.

1059
02:18:54,643 --> 02:18:58,273
You're right. We'll imprison
him for the time being.

1060
02:18:58,383 --> 02:19:02,583
No Laila. Leave me,
I say...

1061
02:19:02,783 --> 02:19:07,353
I take the responsibility
of curing the Queen.

1062
02:19:07,763 --> 02:19:12,423
I'm an experienced priest,
a messenger of God.

1063
02:19:12,763 --> 02:19:16,703
I wish to make a request
with the King.

1064
02:19:17,063 --> 02:19:21,663
If your prayers can
cure my Queen...

1065
02:19:21,873 --> 02:19:25,033
...then I'll be highly obliged.

1066
02:19:25,773 --> 02:19:30,303
But this Mosque is the
appropriate place for it.

1067
02:19:30,513 --> 02:19:32,783
Why do you all wish to
pray in my Palace then?

1068
02:19:33,013 --> 02:19:38,113
We can't achieve our goal
by praying elsewhere.

1069
02:19:38,493 --> 02:19:43,393
My God taught me that,
where the patient's there...

1070
02:19:43,623 --> 02:19:46,023
...prayers should be
offered there.

1071
02:19:46,393 --> 02:19:51,093
If by tomorrow evening
the Queen's not O.K...

1072
02:19:51,333 --> 02:19:54,893
...you can chop off the
heads of we 40 priests.

1073
02:19:57,173 --> 02:19:59,833
How's my Laila?
Any news about her?

1074
02:20:00,173 --> 02:20:02,673
Yes. Come with me.

1075
02:20:13,323 --> 02:20:15,853
Kaish you and here?

1076
02:20:16,223 --> 02:20:19,523
To give a new life
to the Queen...

1077
02:20:19,793 --> 02:20:22,993
...there was no other way.
You go...

1078
02:20:55,563 --> 02:20:58,193
Your debtor has come once
again before you.

1079
02:21:01,003 --> 02:21:06,273
Oh my royal one, where did
you get these costly anklets?

1080
02:21:07,883 --> 02:21:15,043
I'm here with torn
and tattered clothes.

1081
02:21:16,383 --> 02:21:20,723
People see my plight and
say that...

1082
02:21:20,953 --> 02:21:23,393
...I've turned senile
in your love.

1083
02:21:26,293 --> 02:21:32,893
Please honor that senile
Kaish today, my love.

1084
02:21:40,473 --> 02:21:43,973
There might not be riches at
the feet of the Queen today.

1085
02:21:48,283 --> 02:21:52,723
But there's a piece of
Majnu's rag on you.

1086
02:21:58,333 --> 02:22:04,033
Accept this so that...

1087
02:22:04,233 --> 02:22:07,673
...the love of this poor man can
always cling to your feet.

1088
02:22:15,813 --> 02:22:24,153
My Kaish...
- May you live long, my love.

1089
02:22:24,993 --> 02:22:31,363
May God give you a long
and prosperous life.

1090
02:22:31,363 --> 02:22:35,563
May your problems
come to me.

1091
02:22:35,663 --> 02:22:37,153
Don't say that, my lord.

1092
02:22:39,533 --> 02:22:41,973
As such you've suffered
enough for my sake.

1093
02:22:43,773 --> 02:22:45,933
Just look at your plight.

1094
02:22:46,813 --> 02:22:48,783
How has the world
tortured you?

1095
02:22:50,183 --> 02:22:54,583
I can't remember a thing.
When you're there before me...

1096
02:22:55,153 --> 02:23:03,563
...I'm in heaven. Smile my love
so that all flowers...

1097
02:23:03,763 --> 02:23:08,133
...will shower their spring
on your face.

1098
02:23:26,113 --> 02:23:28,053
Saw this, O King?

1099
02:23:28,683 --> 02:23:31,013
Gave her the status of
a Queen after all?

1100
02:23:31,893 --> 02:23:34,793
Look, how your trust
is being fulfilled.

1101
02:23:35,193 --> 02:23:39,593
If I've broken your trust,
you may punish me.

1102
02:23:39,963 --> 02:23:41,863
Punish only me and not Kaish.

1103
02:23:46,973 --> 02:23:53,603
I had told him not to
meet you again.

1104
02:23:55,683 --> 02:23:59,043
I'm the culprit and how can
you punish Kaish

1105
02:23:59,313 --> 02:24:00,843
Is this the way you
render justice?

1106
02:24:11,893 --> 02:24:15,163
I had even said that if Kaish...

1107
02:24:16,433 --> 02:24:18,833
...refuses to obey the
request of a husband...

1108
02:24:19,173 --> 02:24:21,633
...he'll have to incur the
wrath of a royal King.

1109
02:24:24,003 --> 02:24:28,503
No Kaish...
- Move away...

1110
02:24:33,853 --> 02:24:38,653
Oh God! don't torture
my Kaish.

1111
02:24:39,853 --> 02:24:42,293
Today if you also don't
render justice...

1112
02:24:42,693 --> 02:24:44,753
...I'll lose my faith on you.

1113
02:24:45,733 --> 02:24:48,423
May my love for Kaish
become a shield to him.

1114
02:24:49,033 --> 02:24:51,263
Show your miracle
to the King, also.

1115
02:24:59,443 --> 02:25:05,743
Thank God, you've
heard my prayers.

1116
02:25:24,933 --> 02:25:37,373
Stop it O King. If you
whip him more then...

1117
02:25:37,643 --> 02:25:40,943
...the Queen will die.
- What are you blabbering?

1118
02:25:41,553 --> 02:25:44,643
I'm whipping him and how
can Laila be hurt there?

1119
02:25:44,923 --> 02:25:48,153
Yes my Lord. Laila called
for the God of justice.

1120
02:25:48,493 --> 02:25:53,933
He too bowed down before
their divine love.

1121
02:25:54,063 --> 02:25:55,293
Then why not we
humans bow down?

1122
02:26:27,533 --> 02:26:33,933
Oh! God, what've I done?
Please forgive me.

1123
02:26:38,143 --> 02:26:45,843
Oh King, how's Kaish now?
- Your love's great, Laila.

1124
02:26:47,113 --> 02:26:51,213
Even in this plight you
worry only about Kaish.

1125
02:26:51,653 --> 02:26:55,143
Oh! wicked ones, my Laila's
life's in danger. Leave me.

1126
02:26:55,463 --> 02:26:59,523
Leave him.
- How's my Laila, O King?

1127
02:27:01,933 --> 02:27:03,923
Those who realize God...

1128
02:27:04,363 --> 02:27:07,603
...miracles happen on earth
due to them.

1129
02:27:08,073 --> 02:27:13,013
God has realized the
love of Laila and Majnu.

1130
02:27:13,673 --> 02:27:18,543
The King bows down
before you, today.

1131
02:27:18,953 --> 02:27:21,783
O King of love, pardon me.

1132
02:27:24,893 --> 02:27:29,453
Very soon you'll meet Kaish.

1133
02:27:37,233 --> 02:27:42,293
There was no place for pain
in our acquaintance.

1134
02:27:43,203 --> 02:27:49,613
I divorce you and will get
you married to Kaish today.

1135
02:28:13,203 --> 02:28:15,003
I've kept up my promise.

1136
02:28:15,873 --> 02:28:19,103
At least I've turned Laila's
tears to her smile.

1137
02:28:27,683 --> 02:28:31,083
A few priests are praying
in the palace.

1138
02:28:32,053 --> 02:28:35,923
Let's request them to
conduct your marriage.

1139
02:28:37,093 --> 02:28:41,463
Adorn the bride of
Kaish, very well.

1140
02:28:53,043 --> 02:28:57,533
Oh devotees of God!
your entrance into the palace...

1141
02:28:57,943 --> 02:29:01,353
...has brought spring
into the life of Laila.

1142
02:29:02,283 --> 02:29:06,883
I've divorced her.
She'll marry Kaish now.

1143
02:29:08,053 --> 02:29:11,253
I want you to conduct
their wedding.

1144
02:29:13,363 --> 02:29:19,493
You've sacrificed your
happiness for Kaish.

1145
02:29:20,073 --> 02:29:24,633
You're a King of hearts.

1146
02:29:25,443 --> 02:29:30,033
If you permit, can this
hermit embrace you?

1147
02:29:30,483 --> 02:29:34,883
My pleasure...
- Oh! King...

1148
02:29:47,133 --> 02:29:50,863
Did you recognize me now?

1149
02:29:52,173 --> 02:29:56,303
Ever since you've made
my one eye blind...

1150
02:29:56,803 --> 02:30:00,333
...the other eye's waiting
to take a revenge.

1151
02:30:01,173 --> 02:30:03,873
Today, I've settled
my scores with you.

1152
02:30:04,413 --> 02:30:09,043
Let me deal with that
lady due to whom, my eyes...

1153
02:30:11,523 --> 02:30:14,323
Today, you won't survive.

1154
02:30:19,463 --> 02:30:30,433
Don't worry about me.
Save your Laila from Kajak. Go...

1155
02:30:42,553 --> 02:30:45,313
Stop...

1156
02:31:19,123 --> 02:31:23,063
Look, he's coming.

1157
02:31:25,863 --> 02:31:31,733
Break his legs so that he
can't reach his Laila.

1158
02:33:16,703 --> 02:33:23,733
Oh God! I had sworn to
support Laila all my life.

1159
02:33:24,543 --> 02:33:28,743
But before reaching my goal,
I seem to be dying.

1160
02:33:30,653 --> 02:33:35,593
Love of Kaish is not
dependant on you.

1161
02:33:57,183 --> 02:34:01,813
Your bride has come
to your arms, Kaish.

1162
02:34:02,083 --> 02:34:06,253
I've got my life and now
we'll never be separated.

1163
02:34:06,453 --> 02:34:11,393
Yes my Lord. Now death
alone can separate us.

1164
02:34:12,293 --> 02:34:15,493
Are you O.K?
Why did you scream then?

1165
02:34:15,703 --> 02:34:20,293
Seeing your plight, the way
the wicked have broken your leg.

1166
02:34:20,773 --> 02:34:25,173
When you're there what's
the use of my legs?

1167
02:34:25,673 --> 02:34:33,203
I only need eyes to see
you all my life.

1168
02:34:33,713 --> 02:34:35,613
May you live long
my Lord...

1169
02:34:36,753 --> 02:34:39,983
What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

1170
02:34:43,563 --> 02:34:48,123
Blood in your hands?
- I became your bride.

1171
02:34:48,703 --> 02:34:53,193
Wanted to put henna.
That's also applied now.

1172
02:35:03,143 --> 02:35:08,243
Embrace me Kaish.

1173
02:35:10,123 --> 02:35:13,883
I'll remain in your arms
till my last breath.

1174
02:35:37,983 --> 02:35:39,843
You said it right...

1175
02:35:41,883 --> 02:35:52,993
Death alone can
separate us.

1176
02:36:01,403 --> 02:36:13,113
Thanks a lot, God that
you've pierced my heart.

1177
02:36:17,823 --> 02:36:31,093
Let my heart struggle more,
as I've a promise to fulfil.

1178
02:36:34,873 --> 02:36:37,233
I've to die at Laila's feet.

1179
02:36:47,713 --> 02:36:58,563
My bride has worn cuffs
in her leg now.

1180
02:37:17,783 --> 02:37:21,613
Several years passed by.

1181
02:37:21,783 --> 02:37:27,083
Laila and Majnu were one
soul in 2 bodies.

1182
02:37:27,253 --> 02:37:31,313
They were ideal lovers.
