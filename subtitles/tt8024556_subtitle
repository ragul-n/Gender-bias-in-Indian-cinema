00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,818
"l am like a delicate sparrow."

2
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,883
"
 am as agile as a peahen.."

3
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,328
"

4
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,523
"
 have tiny feet."

5
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,895
"

6
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,564
"l am like a delicate sparrow."

7
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:31,808
"if you are like a delicate sparrow,
a golden tiger.."

8
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,371
"Pink lips on a bright face."

9
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,376
"Pink lips on a bright face."

10
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,546
"You get them as dowry."

11
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:45,224
"You are like a delicate sparrow."

12
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:58,232
"Just before sunrise,
I saw the moon shaped like a ring."

13
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:02,469
"That's why I am
singing joyous songs."

14
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,136
"That's why I am
singing joyous songs."

15
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:11,049
"And having a little fun.
It is called a ring.."

16
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:16,222
"It is called a ring..
But it binds us together."

17
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,055
"While taking wedding vows.."

18
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,557
"While taking wedding vows.."

19
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,155
"Tell me,
how do I control my excitement?"

20
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:28,930
"Just before sunrise, I saw.."

21
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:34,064
"You adorn my name
drawn with henna of love."

22
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,340
"She wants to ward off all evil.."

23
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,540
"She wants to ward off all evil.."

24
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,981
"My mother awaits us at the doorstep."

25
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,508
"She will keep you happy.."

26
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,388
"She will keep you happy.."

27
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,891
"The margosa tree
provides a good shade."

28
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,223
"l will fulfill all your desires.."

29
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,427
"l will fulfill all your desires.."

30
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,557
"Just enter my abode."

31
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,628
"You adorn henna of love.."

32
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:14,138
"Freshly crushed cardamom
is always good I say."

33
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:18,345
"
 ask God for you in my prayers."

34
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,481
"
 ask God for you in my prayers."

35
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:27,323
"The blue mountains
got coated in silver."

36
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:32,628
"When I saw you, I was bewildered."

37
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,437
Our boy Mehnga finally got married!

38
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,106
Go to sleep! Only if you
sleep will the kids stay awake.

39
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,203
Hello.

40
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,045
Hello.

41
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,240
If you don't mind,
can I lift your veil?

42
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,226
Please forgive me for any error.

43
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,072
It slipped.

44
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,219
You are so beautiful.

45
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,421
I am in trouble.

46
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,561
You are so much better than me.

47
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,292
I don't understand
how will I treasure you?

48
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,169
You are so beautiful,
how will I keep you safe?

49
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,643
You cried a lot when
you left your parents house.

50
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,647
All girls cry, I know.

51
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,450
But you looked like you were asking your
father what have you gotten me into?

52
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,575
no

53
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,647
Really?
I hope it's not so.

54
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,791
I am not making big promises to you.

55
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:23,799
I have a acre of land,
one buffalo, a few liters of milk..

56
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,637
..and a small house
and you will be its queen.

57
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,207
I won't be able to fulfill
many of your dreams.

58
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,338
"but I will try to do my best.

59
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,342
I have just one desire.

60
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,813
That I should be given
a chance to cook for everyone..

61
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,453
..and my mother-in-law
should love me like a mother.

62
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,487
You will get that.

63
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,795
Well, even my mother has
never loved me like a mother.

64
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,692
I hope my get that
from my mother-in-law.

65
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,364
It's okay,
we will survive by sing and dance.

66
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,571
I mean with each other's company.

67
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,133
Why not sing and dance?

68
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,909
I heard that you sing well.

69
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,206
- No.
- I know.

70
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,813
Someone told me.

71
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,712
Hum a few lines for me.

72
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,421
- I will switch off the lights.
- No.

73
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,918
Okay, I will sing.

74
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,832
"Come brother,
let me secure our bond."

75
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,867
Wrong relationship, wrong song.

76
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,238
Don't bother!

77
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,336
She is missing her brother.

78
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,177
She is quite loyal to her family.

79
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,642
What kind of a song is that?

80
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,380
Don't you know any romantic song?

81
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,823
I only know songs which
describe brother-sister's bond.

82
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,952
No, please sing a romantic song.

83
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,526
No.

84
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,562
Please.

85
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,824
- No.
- Please?

86
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,726
- Then I will switch off the lights.
- No.

87
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,235
I will sing you one.

88
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,238
Go on.

89
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,740
"My mother found me a
husband who is half-blind."

90
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:16,212
If you intend to sing
then sing for all of us.

91
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,479
I borrowed 75,000 from
the grocer and got them married.

92
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,883
I didn't bring her
here to entertain you guys.

93
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,889
- Take me along.
- I think everyone is awake.

94
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,455
They never wake up
for religious purposes.

95
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:27,460
Let's go.

96
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,494
Let's go, everyone.

97
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,558
0K8‘!-

98
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,524
She will sing something.
Sing.

99
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,768
Should I sing instead?

100
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,600
- No, let her sing.
- Okay.

101
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,605
They want to hear you.
Go ahead.

102
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,470
Sing.

103
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,375
l--

104
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,250
I have written this song.

105
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,809
Okay, so you write them as well?

106
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,857
She is going to sing
something she has composed.

107
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,519
"You are Laung and I am Laachi."

108
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,961
"I am lost in your love."

109
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,797
"Your love stole
my delicate hear-t away."

110
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:13,533
"
 am the shadow produced
by the mountains of Chambe."

111
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:18,543
- "
 hide your name in my eyes."
- She sings <i>so</i> well. Open the doors.

112
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,636
We too want to sit
inside and hear her.

113
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,910
There's enough place
for a few of us to sit inside.

114
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,678
The bulb got fused.

115
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,379
Where's the bed?

116
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,587
Boo!

117
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,834
This isn't your age
to play hide and seek.

118
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,962
No, but I can play
catch the thief, can't l?

119
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,405
You are the thief and I am a cop.

120
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,966
Where's my interest?

121
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,510
In order to pay your interest.

122
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,739
...I have star-ted taking tailoring
orders from far and wide.

123
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,706
I cannot see well either.

124
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,716
I cannot even make out whether
you are standing here or there.

125
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,616
I will pay it, I am not running away.

126
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,484
Try running away.

127
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,717
Boy, get the ledger.
Let's take her house.

128
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,049
She is running away!
I am coming!

129
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,988
- I am coming at the speed of 100.
- Come.

130
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,030
I am coming at the speed of 100.

131
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,031
Boy, get me some water.

132
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:20,361
"Wanderer came."

133
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,000
Why are you running, sister-in-law?
Grocer stopped you again?

134
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:27,502
Right. I never ran <i>so</i> much
when I was young <i>as</i> I run now.

135
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,708
He'll get you one day.

136
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,453
- Laachi?
- Yes?

137
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,091
Stop with drawing these flowers, dear.

138
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,425
There are plenty available outside.

139
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,087
It's been a month
since you got married.

140
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,864
You aren't my daughter-in-law.
You are my daughter.

141
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,491
Start stitching cloths
with me from today.

142
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,003
- We need to pay off the grocer's loan.
- Okay, mother.

143
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,663
Okay. Come on, dear.

144
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,838
Should I just you now,
or after I deliver him the lunch?

145
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,399
Go and deliver him lunch.
He must be hungry.

146
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,043
It's not as if the
grocer will follow me home.

147
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,103
I'll handle him if he does,
that Knucklehead.

148
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,550
Oh my!

149
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,861
- What are you staring at?
- At Mehnga's good for-tune.

150
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,457
From the time he got married,
no one in the village eats.

151
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,864
"but he asks for
lunch three times a day.

152
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,027
All wives should be like her.

153
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,901
You feel like taking her
to the hospital even if she sneezes.

154
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,599
Look at him talk like that.

155
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,837
- You should die drowning in shame.
- I died the day I married you.

156
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,503
Now I only need to drown.

157
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:40,112
Such women can even make
Anna Hazare break his fast.

158
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,888
What have you made?

159
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,523
Lentils.

160
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,997
Lentils?
Again?

161
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,930
What other option do I have?

162
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,112
God help you.

163
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,073
Have you..

164
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,515
Have you ever loved someone?

165
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,076
Yes.

166
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:49,979
My mother.

167
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,620
- The other kind.
- The dirty Kind?

168
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,687
Why is it dirty?

169
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,231
N is dirty.

170
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:03,934
Haven't you witnessed? When two
lovers are caught, how people react?

171
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,732
"They are so filthy!"

172
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,796
They want to make their
videos and upload it.

173
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,035
No, like the old school kind of love.
The good kind.

174
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,080
No, no, no. Love was the
same in the old school as well.

175
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,209
People just didn't have
mobile phones back then.

176
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:20,084
My uncle had fallen
in love when he was young.

177
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:21,915
He got caught.

178
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,885
He still cannot walk properly.

179
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,084
If there is any problem
in the village.

180
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,520
..everyone's hands
and legs shiver but.

181
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,264
..for uncle, only his hands shiver.

182
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:33,696
Poor thing.

183
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:39,931
Why are you asking about it?

184
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,274
Just.

185
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,741
Have you ever been in love?

186
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,970
No.

187
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,585
You are so beautiful.

188
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,153
I am sure someone must
have been in love with you.

189
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,179
No.

190
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,655
There must have been
a few who'd stare at you.

191
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,686
There were many.

192
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,664
Someone has rightly said:

193
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,099
Never ask how the journey was,
to guests.

194
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,758
You should be grateful
that they are here.

195
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,867
But we girls are used to ignore them.

196
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,104
0K8‘!-

197
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,136
Fine.

198
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:25,618
I really wanted to fall
in love and then get married.

199
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,349
- You are regretting?
- No.

200
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:32,916
Actually, I used to think
that we live as humans only once.

201
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,058
If both my desires
would get fulfilled..

202
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,186
If I could fall in
love and then get married?

203
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:41,199
Who knows what animal
I will be born as next?

204
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,632
True.

205
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,633
Then only one of your desires will
get fulfilled. They don't get married.

206
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,136
They only love.

207
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,172
Bloody animals.

208
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,976
But we can still fulfill my desire.

209
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,614
Who do you want to
fall in love with now?

210
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:57,715
With you.

211
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,251
Why with me?
I am already married.

212
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,020
You should've fulfilled all
your desires in your paternal home.

213
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,819
I used to wash my
father's turban every day.

214
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,263
I had thought,
I'd fulfill all my desires.

215
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,865
“with the one my father
gets me married to.

216
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,096
How will we do it?
I don't understand. How?

217
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,332
Assume that we don't know each other.

218
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,676
We are complete strangers.

219
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,734
We don't know each other?

220
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,105
This is not how you
behave when in love.

221
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,147
This is how you behave
when you have borrowed a sum.

222
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,713
..and you don't want to pay it back.

223
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,216
"We don't know each other."

224
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,844
My mother is an expert at that.

225
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,246
Let's give it a try.

226
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,985
Assume that you belong
to poor family in this village.

227
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:40,888
You are average looking.

228
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,053
I am a beautiful rich girl
from the neighboring village.

229
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,188
- Okay, I am average looking?
- Yes.

230
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,723
And you are beautiful.
Then love is impossible.

231
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,762
There are bound to be some difference.

232
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,703
But where will you stay?

233
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,434
We will stay in the same house.

234
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,937
But not as husband and wife.
Like strangers.

235
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,209
And if you make me
fall in love with you..

236
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,212
"then we will stay
as husband and wife.

237
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:10,218
I had a doubt whether
we were really married or not.

238
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,188
Who says we don't know each other?
We know each other.

239
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,155
We got married.
We have photographs to prove that.

240
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,787
We have a video of our wedding!

241
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,455
It is so nice.
You are sitting like this.

242
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,790
And there is a song playing in
the background. "Listen, my beloved."

243
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,696
"The sweet melody of love."

244
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,762
- Okay. Fine.
- "
 chose you."

245
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,363
- I won't.
- "You too choose me."

246
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,805
We are married!

247
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,267
Hey!

248
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,105
Laachi!

249
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,278
What?

250
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:42,185
The day you got married,
you said you didn't have any desires.

251
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,783
You had just one desire, that
you should be given a chance to cook.

252
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,921
Should we expand this desire a little?

253
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,755
Should we have a feast instead?

254
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,421
I didn't ask you to fulfill
any desire which needs money?

255
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,027
I didn't ask for gold or silver.

256
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,831
You cannot even give me the
happiness which is available for free?

257
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,928
Happiness which is available
for free doesn't seem like happiness.

258
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,936
You always have to
pay a price for happiness.

259
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,104
If happiness was available for free..

260
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,109
"then my father would
have been staying with us.

261
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,246
He wouldn't have left us.

262
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,251
He didn't have to
pay us to stay with us.

263
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,783
I have heard that
fathers are like banks.

264
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,861
My mother would have held
her head high in the village.

265
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,523
I would have been educated.

266
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:36,939
What if I make you
not miss your father?

267
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:46,314
Okay, so from now onwards,
I am your father.

268
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,179
From now onwards, your mother will
hold her head high in the village.

269
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,423
You will never be sad
again as long as I am with you.

270
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:59,464
Oh yes, don't worry, and let me
know if you want to thrash somebody.

271
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,365
Papa.

272
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,173
My papa is so beautiful.

273
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,108
If my papa were so beautiful..

274
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,373
..we would have been
well respected in the village.

275
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,388
People would have
invited him home for tea.

276
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:24,889
They would have told me..

277
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:28,861
"Mehnga, go call your father.
Let's have some tea and snacks."

278
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,328
The whole village would
have been crazy about my father.

279
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,396
Okay, enough of this.

280
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,131
Now your father needs to go
and stitch clothes with your mother.

281
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,005
Okay.
We are strangers henceforth.

282
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,613
I don't know you
and you don't know me.

283
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:54,951
0K8‘!-

284
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,555
How are you, buddy?

285
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,958
Buddy, my foot!

286
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,119
How dare you tease a girl like this?

287
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,491
You want to me to get my sandals out?

288
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,461
ls this how anyone
talks to her husband?

289
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,129
We are strangers.

290
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:15,864
"Let's live our lives as we please."

291
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,378
"You live only once, sweeties."

292
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,111
Yes, mother. I am very happy.

293
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,518
The whole family is very nice.

294
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,615
They are well respected
across the village.

295
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,350
He too is very nice.

296
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,326
He takes good care of me.

297
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,291
I don't think I will ever
get upset and go back there.

298
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,158
If I ever miss you..

299
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,599
"then you are with me.

300
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,440
Yes, I was getting the blankets out.

301
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,370
To keep them under the sun.

302
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,172
He doesn't have a good one.

303
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,471
I'll call you back.

304
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,481
We don't have good blankets?

305
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,314
Do you have your mother
hiding in the blanket?

306
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,355
You are here with me.
Your mother is hiding in it?

307
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,650
You won't understand.

308
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,159
Yes, I don't understand you at all.

309
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:14,131
Actually, my granny was married
very far away from her family.

310
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,060
Whenever she used to miss her mother"

311
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,474
..she used to take
this blanket and hug it.

312
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,344
Then she passed it on to my mother.

313
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,082
I have seen my mother.

314
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,249
..hugging this blanket and..

315
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,618
And I will pass on this
blanket to my daughter.

316
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,986
This blanket has never..

317
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,321
...let a daughter
be away from her mother.

318
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,664
But who knows whether or not
I'll be able to give it to my mother?

319
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:57,465
Why?

320
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,968
Why won't we? We aren't that pauper.

321
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,038
I am yet to fall in love, get married.

322
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,745
Let's see what happens.

323
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,119
She pretended to be my father
for a few minutes and trapped me.

324
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,089
I don't know whether I'll ever be able
to be a father to future daughter.

325
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:24,625
Uncle

326
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,630
"Hey boy,
if you want to check out my gait."

327
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,471
"Get me a silver water pot!"

328
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,568
- "And watch my waist."
- Enough, uncle.

329
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:34,477
Don't move your waist a lot,
your hip bone will crack.

330
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,378
Well said, nephew.

331
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:39,743
- Uncle..
- Yes?

332
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,779
I wanted to ask something.

333
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,155
Go ahead.

334
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,548
You were in love, right?

335
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,581
That's why I am like this.

336
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,462
- Right.
- This world hates love.

337
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,191
Specially the bottom half.

338
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,391
It breaks it.

339
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,297
Oh.

340
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,032
But why do you ask?

341
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,328
Just. 
.. Enjoy the meal.

342
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,139
Uncle, this love..
how does one do that?

343
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:05,806
How does one express it,
please tell me.

344
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,040
Here you go.

345
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:12,750
During our times,
we used to first find a girl.

346
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,081
0K8‘!-

347
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:17,145
Steal glances at first.

348
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,319
- Okay.
- Then stare at her.

349
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,187
0K8‘!-

350
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,125
Stare at her at someone's wedding..

351
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,595
Stare at her while passing by..

352
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,197
- Stare at her at someone's funeral..
- Okay.

353
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,801
You spend five years doing that.

354
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,063
How many?

355
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,569
- Five.
- Five years?

356
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,273
Then you learn what
lies in the girl's heart.

357
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:39,468
0K8‘!-

358
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,536
Then you need a pigeon.

359
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,444
Wh‘! a pigeon?

360
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:44,845
Because it's hot?

361
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,209
I'll break your..

362
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,520
Because it can fly!

363
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,782
To pass letters.

364
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,219
You deserved to get your legs broken.

365
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,555
- What.
- You make pigeon do your dirty work.

366
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,754
Shebds buffalo's unwell.

367
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,920
I'll go and inquire about its health.

368
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,163
You take care.

369
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:28,852
ls this how you steal glances?

370
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,219
How else do I do it?
You are clearly visible.

371
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,791
You should look at me..

372
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,920
..but I don't find out
that you are stealing glances.

373
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:39,759
I didn't understand, but I'll do that.

374
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,800
You shouldn't find out that I saw you.

375
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,299
"
 saw you! I saw you! I saw you!"

376
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,202
Look..

377
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:48,634
At least look at me.

378
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,836
Sometimes you say look
sometimes you say don't look.

379
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,971
How do I look?
Should I look like this?

380
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,871
Okay, let it be.

381
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,441
I'll do it and show it to you.

382
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,812
Come and sit over here.

383
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,618
I am a boy and you are a girl.

384
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,619
You are a boy and I am a girl.

385
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,419
Yes. Do some embroidery.

386
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,582
0K8‘!-

387
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,387
I am coming.

388
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:11,554
I am sitting right here.

389
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,229
- Here, I saw you.
- Okay.

390
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,230
And here I didn't see you.

391
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:17,763
- Here, I saw you.
- Yes..

392
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,370
Here I didn't see you.

393
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:20,769
Damn, it's hard to
make out when you do it.

394
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,675
Here we looked into each other's eyes.

395
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,403
- And I looked away.
- Why?

396
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,610
Girls love this.

397
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,514
They feel that the
boy's mother is very good.

398
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:36,248
She has taught him not to
look at girls will ill intentions.

399
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:38,481
I understood.

400
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,617
Listen, my mother too
has taught me the same.

401
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,019
That one should not to look
at girls will ill intentions.

402
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,691
But she didn't demonstrate it.

403
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,528
"Son, here you saw the girls,
and here you didn't see the girls."

404
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,627
"Son, here you saw the girls,
and here you didn't see the girls."

405
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,001
"Son, here you saw the girls,
and here you didn't see the girls."

406
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:54,967
Oh no.

407
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,642
- There my mother has seen her son.
- Oh God, when will the sun set?

408
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,285
Has mother gone to sleep?

409
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:09,319
Yes.

410
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,648
Has she switched off the light?

411
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:12,722
Yes.

412
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,416
Bring, water.

413
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,587
What are you doing?

414
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,631
Here, I saw the girl. Here I didn't.

415
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,997
Here, I saw the girl. Here I didn't.

416
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,872
Here, I saw the girl.
And her father saw me!

417
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:27,929
Here I didn't.

418
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,541
Here, I saw the girl. Here I didn't.

419
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:30,769
You are really that naA-ve?

420
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:33,370
I am feeling pity on you.

421
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,076
We can move things forward.

422
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,021
H ow?

423
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,625
You call me up by mistake.

424
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,494
Benefit?

425
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,720
We will star-t talking to each other.

426
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,490
To strike a conversation
is the toughest part.

427
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,097
Sometimes it even takes five years.

428
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,359
And you still don't
get a chance to talk.

429
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,471
Did you meet my uncle too?

430
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:05,538
I won't take that long.

431
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,878
- I will call you up by mistake.
- Do that.

432
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:09,973
Stan.

433
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,612
Hello?

434
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,917
It's a wrong number. Look over there.

435
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:25,830
Hello?

436
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,023
Hello.

437
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,657
Hello, who is it?

438
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:30,729
Who are you?

439
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,700
You called up. You tell me.

440
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,664
I am Mehnga.

441
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,674
What's your worth?

442
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,103
I have 15 rupees balance in my phone.
So you can do the math.

443
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,372
How did you get my number?

444
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:43,813
H ow?

445
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,046
I went to the bus depot.

446
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,490
Your number was written
on the bathrooms wall.

447
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,553
What?

448
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:58,124
It was written to contact on this
number if you want to donate eyes.

449
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,432
I want to donate my mother's eyes.

450
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,629
I think Sikha did this.

451
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,000
She must have written
my number on the wall.

452
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,563
She is jealous because
I am more beautiful.

453
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,875
Who is Sikha?

454
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,044
Sikha who stays in Nandnagar?

455
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,174
Yes.

456
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:18,608
She is very beautiful.

457
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:26,180
If you agree to meet then
I can decide who is better looking.

458
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,525
Good answer.

459
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,562
I liked it.

460
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:32,564
Really?

461
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:33,688
Thank God.

462
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:34,630
Hello?

463
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,733
Hello?

464
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:39,935
If you liked that,
can we meet in the morning?

465
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,133
Hey, how can I just agree to meet you?

466
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,035
First, say something about my voice.

467
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,509
Well..it's a little distorted.

468
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:50,948
Wrong answer.

469
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,643
She is scoring me?

470
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,951
I never talk to strangers
who dial wrong numbers.

471
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,459
I don't know why I am talking to you.

472
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,592
You liked the things I said.

473
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,659
Stop troubling me.

474
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,530
We have a mansion in Sundar Nagri.

475
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,967
I will go to college at sharp 8:30am.

476
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,594
Don't you dare come there!

477
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,139
I am warning you.

478
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,102
Okay. Okay, I won't come
there at 8:30am.

479
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,209
8:30am.

480
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:30,922
I had to go on the
fields early but anyway..

481
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,016
"l am like a delicate sparrow."

482
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,084
"
 am as agile as a peahen.."

483
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:40,723
"
 have tiny feet."

484
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,930
"
 have tiny feet."

485
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,096
"
 have mesmerizing eyes.."

486
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:49,971
"l am like a delicate sparrow."

487
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:55,009
"if you are like a delicate sparrow,
a golden tiger.."

488
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,778
"Pink lips on a bright face."

489
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,782
"Pink lips on a bright face."

490
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,947
"You get them as dowry."

491
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,650
"You are like a delicate sparrow."
Recognized me?

492
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:07,624
Wrong number?

493
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,092
You look like a wrong number.

494
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,626
I don't need to recognize you.

495
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,793
You are no good at this.

496
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,229
Move aside, I need to go to college.

497
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:16,959
You will go walking?

498
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,001
Then let me accompany you.
You will have company.

499
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:22,166
No, I have a scooter.

500
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,037
Where's my scooter?

501
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,108
Where's my scooter?

502
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,306
- I found it.
- Where?

503
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,049
This is a scooter?

504
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,178
Yes, everyone in
my family has a scooter.

505
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:36,846
We are very rich.

506
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,686
My father has a government job..

507
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:41,124
..so does my mother,
my brother and my sister-in-law.

508
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,821
When we leave together on
our scooters, villagers shout.

509
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,091
"There's a hundred
thousand burning away."

510
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:47,656
Everyone is jealous of us.

511
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,636
Don't follow me on a jeep.

512
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,868
Okay, you are on a scooter,
so I will follow you on a jeep.

513
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,143
0K8‘!-

514
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,181
What should I pretend to be my jeep?

515
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,340
Wait.

516
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,185
Who parked the jeep on the wall?

517
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,586
My servants are so careless.

518
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:19,162
It's yours?

519
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:23,200
No, my friend's?
I wash and clean it for him.

520
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,368
Oh God.

521
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,731
Let's stop it, it feels stupid.

522
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,376
Hey beautiful, where to?

523
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,779
I am going to my big college to study.

524
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,711
What do you study in your big college?

525
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,619
Social Studies.

526
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:48,621
What have you learnt
from the society then?

527
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,185
That one shouldn't talk to strangers.

528
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,859
You can't talk to strangers.

529
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,628
..but you can sit with a
stranger on his jeep, can't you?

530
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,227
Hop on to my jeep. Come on.
Here, sit here.

531
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,232
Come on.
Come on.

532
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,808
I'm racing it.

533
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,240
You'll hit something, be careful.

534
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,182
Don't you didn't tell
me that we own a jeep.

535
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,227
You should give me a lift sometimes.

536
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:26,390
Seasons change by the time
I walk home from the bus depot.

537
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:29,657
It's okay, our whole family
will go together on the no moon day.

538
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:35,400
Don't worry about me. Just help
your mother cross the grocer's store.

539
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:40,134
It is like Rajasthaﬁs border for her.

540
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,143
We have reached the college.

541
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,752
Whose goats are roaming freely?

542
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,287
Boo!

543
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,391
- And the rest?
- Let's play tomorrow?

544
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:55,391
- Today.
- Let go of my plait.

545
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,196
Otherwise, I will lodge an
eve teasing complaint against you.

546
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,892
You know how to behave
like a lady whenever convenient.

547
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,360
But who will pay my interest?

548
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,133
I won't lose my plait
for a few pennies.

549
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,037
Ask for the books,
I will give you my thumb impression.

550
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,041
Hey boy, get the books.

551
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,201
Let's settle this today.

552
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,042
I am doing such a big thing.
At least offer me a cold drink.

553
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,945
Cold drink?
Just one?

554
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,877
Drink two.
Hey boy!

555
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,421
I am coming!
I am coming at the speed of 100!

556
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,220
I am coming at the speed of 100!
I got you! I got you!

557
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,294
What if I owed him money?

558
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,095
Thank God she has star-ted working.

559
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,500
Good. Good. Good.
Let's go this.

560
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,172
Let me go work it the fields.
We should help mother out.

561
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,468
- Okay?
- What?

562
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,033
What fields?

563
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,871
And what are you doing
in my college canteen?

564
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,444
- This is a canteen?
- Yes, can't you see?

565
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,747
These are my books.
Exams are approaching.

566
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,048
And my coffee is getting cold.
Oh no.

567
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,423
Okay, okay, okay.

568
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,982
So those are buffaloes.
They are your professors hanging out?

569
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,458
Don't trouble me.

570
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,325
You know exams are approaching.

571
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:08,458
My parents have warned me, if I fail
this time then they will get me married.

572
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:13,095
Get married to me, and you'll
get freedom from these books.

573
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,999
I would rather fail than marry you.

574
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:17,439
I will be like a
traditional girl and marry..

575
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,206
..into an affluent family
chosen by my parents.

576
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,837
You keep talking about being rich.

577
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,846
I too am from a rich family.

578
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,175
I work in the fields just for fun.

579
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,822
We are moneylenders of our village.

580
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,255
Whenever my father passes
through the village.

581
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,851
...people show him respect
and address him as Mr. Bansal.

582
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,520
They salute him.

583
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,190
My father has 1000 notes of 100s.

584
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,525
My father lends money
to everyone in the village.

585
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:47,966
Young or old,
everyone fears my father.

586
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:52,133
My father has killed an old hag. I
will make you covered gold and silver.

587
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,405
If you have any other desire,
if you wish to watch a movie..

588
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:58,576
- ..if you want to have tea and snacks.
- You lazybones!

589
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,943
You didn't tell me
that you had two father?

590
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:06,190
One is dead and the
other is taking loans!

591
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:07,851
Come here!
I will teach you a lesson.

592
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,155
Don't hit me,
you are under father's oath.

593
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,924
I will teach you a lesson.
Who do you think you are?

594
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,498
You lazybones!
You have ruined such a nice girl.

595
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,501
I wonder what you keep
making her do all day long.

596
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:21,904
Hey girl, go pay your parents
a visit and also meet your aunt.

597
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,372
Go deceive her.

598
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,137
I regret the day he was born.

599
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,444
He is dead but he left
this trouble behind for me.

600
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:30,242
God, please make her go out of breath.

601
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,574
You two love dancing, don't you?
Make me dance as well.

602
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,387
They make my blood boil.

603
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,011
She is out of breath.

604
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:46,257
"We are locked in a room together."

605
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,596
"And mother is sitting outside."

606
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,368
Sitting is fine,
I just hope she hasn't fainted.

607
00:37:58,076 --> 00:37:59,942
What are you doing here?

608
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:01,637
I came here to hide from my mother.

609
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,014
Now you have come to
our college's hall as well?

610
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,311
We have come so far?

611
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:12,287
We are doing a dancing
practice over here.

612
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,350
Yes madam, I am coming.

613
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,464
"
 refuse to know anyone like you."

614
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:26,903
"You and l, we are no match."

615
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:30,465
"
 can sell away for scrap."

616
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,201
"
 can sell away.."

617
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,607
What are you?

618
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:37,012
You love to sing,
dance and do drama, don't you?

619
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,912
Did you dance in your house as well?

620
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,249
Dance now if you want to.. Don't
go home and kick the kitchen fire.

621
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,423
What do you mean?

622
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:53,159
I asked you a question
and you replied with a riddle?

623
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,470
I used to dance at weddings.

624
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,366
You used to perform at weddings?

625
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,301
Relatives weddings.

626
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,308
Oh yes.

627
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:08,243
That's the only place
where girls and oldies can.

628
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,407
..dance and vent out their anger.

629
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:11,708
There they say this.

630
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,714
"Dance now if you want to.. Don't go
home and kick the kitchen fire."

631
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,718
Neither the father nor the
brother nor the uncle stops you there.

632
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:22,121
You must have seen
how women dance like crazy?

633
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,988
It is because of this saying.
They fulfill all their desires.

634
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:34,197
I am a poor man,
I cannot offer you gold or silver.

635
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,598
But I can promise you one thing.

636
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:41,545
..you didn't get
married and come here.

637
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,471
You are here for a wedding.

638
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,445
You are a guest.

639
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,353
This isn't a house,
it is a marriage palace.

640
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:54,354
My mother isn't my mother.
She is the DJ.

641
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,461
Dance if you want to
or kick the kitchen fire.

642
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,528
Do whatever you please.

643
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,058
No one will stop you.

644
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:14,107
You know, I used to wonder
why I was named Laachi.

645
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:20,376
Maybe I was destined to
find a partner, a Laung like you.

646
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,484
Why Laung?

647
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,222
It is because I am dark?

648
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:34,765
Yes.

649
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:47,045
"You are Laung and I am Laachi."

650
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,512
"I am lost in your love."

651
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,755
"You are Laung and I am Laachi."

652
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,256
"I am lost in your love."

653
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:04,194
"Your love stole
my delicate hear-t away."

654
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:08,699
"Your love stole
my delicate hear-t away."

655
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:13,431
"
 am the shadow produced
by the mountains of Chambe."

656
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:18,499
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

657
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:24,073
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

658
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,616
"My feet are so pretty."

659
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,128
"You keep going to the city."

660
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:39,823
"
 don't ask for too much."

661
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:43,557
"Just buy me anklets that
don't cost a lot of bucks."

662
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,772
"My feet are so pretty."

663
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,501
"You keep going to the city."

664
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,236
"
 don't ask for too much."

665
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,473
"Just buy me anklets that
don't cost a lot of bucks."

666
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:59,881
"They are easily available
for a low price."

667
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:05,179
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

668
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:09,818
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

669
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:14,730
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

670
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,631
He keeps her so happy.

671
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,126
They keep laughing all daylong.

672
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,798
I too would've kept her happy
if it was me instead of Mehnga.

673
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,602
I would have also build
a proper wall here..

674
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:25,837
..so that no idiot watches
us loving each other.

675
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:34,882
"My dry hair soar,
without you I feel alone."

676
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:39,784
"Take me into your arms,
hide the sun with your charms."

677
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:44,522
"
 leave a message
for you in the skies."

678
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:49,466
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

679
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:54,370
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

680
00:42:54,439 --> 00:43:00,276
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

681
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:15,624
You want some good news?

682
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,454
- I have star-ted liking you.
- Really?

683
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,460
<i>~</i> But..?
~ But?

684
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,727
But my parents send me abroad.

685
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,494
To Canada, for further education.

686
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:24,501
Go.

687
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:25,627
It will take two years.

688
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:26,693
Go.

689
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,532
There's my plane!

690
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:31,832
Leaving already?

691
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,536
- Listen?
- Yes?

692
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,870
Don't put your hand
out of the plane's window.

693
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,913
- Go.
- Okay.

694
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:46,449
See you!
Keep your hands in! Face in!

695
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,487
You are out?

696
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,457
- You didn't leave?
- I have come after two years.

697
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,286
You are still standing here?

698
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:54,531
Two years?

699
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:56,599
0K8‘!-

700
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,563
Well, just.

701
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,661
Once I stand for something,
I keep standing.

702
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:03,832
But I am not standing
at the same place.

703
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:10,778
I was studying and then later,
I started working there.

704
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:14,242
I met a boy at work.

705
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,278
He star-ted liking me.

706
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:20,249
He told his parents
that he wanted to marry me.

707
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,722
We both are from affluent families.

708
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,620
We both have a sedan.

709
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:29,364
Well, my parents
accept their proposal.

710
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:32,999
I couldn't say anything to them.

711
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:34,329
You couldn't say anything?

712
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,598
You didn't think about me?

713
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,369
I was thinking about you.

714
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,433
What were you thinking about?

715
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,736
I thought that I will convince you.

716
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,278
And you will understand.

717
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,948
What makes you think that
we are so easy to understand?

718
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,745
You should have tried
convincing your parents instead.

719
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:48,909
What could I do?

720
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,715
I found him to be fine.

721
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,552
Otherwise,
I would have made some excuse.

722
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:54,590
- You found him to be fine?
- Yes.

723
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,551
Let's stop with this drama.

724
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,728
No, no, no. This is not a drama.

725
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:01,957
You found him to be fine.

726
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,023
No, no, no.

727
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,334
Enough of this.

728
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,403
Go home and make the greens.

729
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,405
If you don't cook it
well then you've had it.

730
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:09,664
Why are you getting so angry?

731
00:45:09,741 --> 00:45:12,301
You only had told me..
I am a guest here.

732
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,844
Dance if you want to
or kick the kitchen fire.

733
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,743
Then go kick the kitchen fire.
Why are you kicking me?

734
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,938
What am I a clay oven?

735
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,082
No, this is not possible.

736
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:23,421
It was just a drama.

737
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,624
You don't value things
if it is easily available to you.

738
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,019
That's why I was saying that.

739
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:34,797
I would pretend to go out with him,
watch movies with him..

740
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,960
..and you would get
drunk and sing sad songs.

741
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,427
"If you had fallen down,
I would have helped you up.."

742
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,562
"Now how can I help when
you have lost my respect?"

743
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:45,005
Or this song..

744
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:47,071
"You will get infested by worms.
You will die a dreadful death."

745
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:48,813
"You deceived me."

746
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:50,806
That's it.

747
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,379
This is all it was.

748
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,492
"If you had fallen down,
I would have helped you up.."

749
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:06,087
"Now how can I help when
you have lost my respect?"

750
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:09,766
Okay?
I saw you laughing with him.

751
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,359
You are cheating me, aren't you?

752
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,097
Yes, I am cheating you. So what?

753
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,496
So what, How happy are you

754
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,904
We are going to get married.

755
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,067
Why don't you believe me, uncle?

756
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:23,546
I heard him say that
you are cheating me.

757
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,810
She kept saying. so what if I did?

758
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,476
So what if I did?

759
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,385
Anyway, it is your family matter.

760
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,456
I shouldn't be dancing like this.

761
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,657
But uncle, I knew it that
he won't be able to handle her.

762
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:38,957
It is a wrong match.

763
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,397
He is fine.

764
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:42,991
He is not so bad.

765
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,000
Yes, the girl is wrong.

766
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:47,003
We should break the
legs of such girls.

767
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,402
No.

768
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,700
Why break anyone's legs?

769
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,071
Break the hands, crack the skull.

770
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,409
- There are a million places
you can hit someone. - True.

771
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,811
She must have strayed.

772
00:46:57,882 --> 00:47:00,476
Hey, this is a limit, uncle!

773
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,110
What's the fault of
such a beautiful girl?

774
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:06,585
She should have been matched
with the right partner.

775
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:11,491
Fine, some is unfortunate.

776
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,157
But who got lucky?

777
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:18,663
Nobody got lucky,
our family got unlucky.

778
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,767
It should have happened
in the neighborhood..

779
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,771
..so that the things would
stay in the neighborhood.

780
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,969
Yes, it could have happened
anywhere in the neighborhood.

781
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,102
Yes.

782
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:42,482
Laachi!

783
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:43,694
Laachi!

784
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:44,751
Come here.

785
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,163
Coming.

786
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,731
- Yes?
- I have been watching the two of you.

787
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:53,061
You two keep busy within yourselves.

788
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,865
What's the secret?

789
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:00,667
I lied to him that I am cheating him.

790
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:03,143
He didn't hit you?

791
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,049
No, I am right in front of you.

792
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,515
You keep watching us stealthily.

793
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,518
He keeps following me around.

794
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,854
Sometimes he gets sweets
and sometimes snacks for me.

795
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:15,216
He wants to win my love back.

796
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,057
0K8‘!-

797
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:18,853
Coming!

798
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:20,855
Litsen

799
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,688
This is the only way
to make them value you.

800
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,094
Listen!

801
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:29,997
Listen up!

802
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:30,973
Come here.

803
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,200
No, I won't.

804
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,610
I will give you some shocking news.

805
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:40,275
I too will give you
some troublesome news.

806
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,813
You have been troubling
me since forever.

807
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:42,853
What's new?

808
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,817
Kids, go and play.

809
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:47,149
Yes, tell me, what is it?

810
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:53,687
Sometimes both the husband
and the wife are good.

811
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,700
But.

812
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,001
You end up liking someone else.

813
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:02,637
You are absolutely right.
When a person..

814
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,004
You star-t liking someone else.

815
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,008
Tell me, what is so troublesome?

816
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:10,070
I have been hiding something from you.

817
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,707
I kept wondering when do I tell you.

818
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,775
And I ended up hiding
it for ten years.

819
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,188
I am having an affair.

820
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,792
An affair?

821
00:49:21,926 --> 00:49:23,087
Hook up?

822
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,150
Amour?

823
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,829
I think everyone's
gone bad in this village.

824
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,764
When you used to go to the fields.

825
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:34,303
..he used to sometimes get ice creams,
sometimes get fritters for me.

826
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:37,098
And sometimes both.

827
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,575
What could I do?

828
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,610
I gave in.

829
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,672
Why give in?

830
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,040
I'll look after you.

831
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,674
Let's go inside.

832
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,051
I'll get fritters for you. Let's go.

833
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:55,582
Go on.

834
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:58,753
I'll get spicy crispy
fritters for you. Go on.

835
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,805
She is Gamma's daughter-in-law.
Lock the door.

836
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,047
An affair?
Have you looked at your face?

837
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,377
- Damn you!
- Who will look at you?

838
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:20,913
You had a hook up?

839
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:24,855
I am doomed!

840
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:27,084
She wants fritters!

841
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:37,765
I never got fritters,
neither in love nor in deceit.

842
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:42,371
Damn you, Laachi!

843
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:56,910
Where are you taking us?
Aren't we going to the village?

844
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:58,786
You know Jagtar Maan,
the artist, don't you?

845
00:50:58,856 --> 00:51:00,346
- Yes.
- I work for him now.

846
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,256
<i>- Okay.
- You know Jagmr Mean?</i>

847
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:04,294
- Oh come on now. - He is bound to
know him as he works for him.

848
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:06,229
We are here. Get down.

849
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:11,167
- This is his office?
- Yes.

850
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,428
Let's go, sister-in-law.

851
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,935
- Where is he taking us?
- Hello, brother.

852
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:23,673
Yes?

853
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,272
- He's my uncle's son.
- Hello.

854
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:26,373
- Hello.
- She is my sister-in-law.

855
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,111
I had told you that she sings well.

856
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,686
Okay!

857
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,188
She is the girl who sang
well on her wedding night.

858
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:32,984
Yes.

859
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:34,684
- You weren't never out of tone.
- Yes.

860
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,091
Considering how nervous
one is on his or her wedding day.

861
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:38,686
And you sang so well.
Anyway, have a seat.

862
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,786
- Have a seat.
- Come here.

863
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,061
It's a pleasure to meet you.

864
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,700
You are such a big artist
and yet you work in the fields.

865
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:50,440
You are so down to earth.

866
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,002
All big artists are like that.

867
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:54,044
No, I am not.

868
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:56,310
I am watering them for the songs.

869
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,940
Water and songs?
I didn't get you.

870
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,814
Look, one has to sell
land to fulfill ones dreams.

871
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:05,916
I just watered three songs.

872
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,783
Two are upbeat and one is sad.

873
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,986
If you are going to sell
them then why water them?

874
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,755
That's what's called
a well placed strategy.

875
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:12,955
Strategy?

876
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:16,792
We click selfies while
pretending to work.

877
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:17,299
<i>'</i> Right?
- Okay,

878
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:19,462
Then I get comments that
you are very down to earth.

879
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:20,129
Yes.

880
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:22,901
That helps you regain
your lost respect.

881
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:23,735
0K8‘!-

882
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,242
I hope you are not into singing too.

883
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:29,107
No, I don't have enough land.

884
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:30,905
I just have 13% acre of land.

885
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:32,311
That is our means of income.

886
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,349
Then it's fine.

887
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,052
As per my experience,
including likes and comments.

888
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:37,986
Yes?

889
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:41,457
I have concluded that
a square meal is what you need.

890
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,988
All artists think the same.

891
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,390
That's what she says <i>as</i> well,
a square meal <i>is</i> enough.

892
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:50,025
- Right. - After all she is an artist,
even if she stays at home.

893
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:53,297
So.. show me what you have got.

894
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,497
- Sure.
- No.

895
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:57,865
- Sing, we are all like your
family members. - Yes.

896
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:00,175
There is nothing to feel shy about.

897
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:01,837
- Sing.
- Don't feel shy.

898
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,105
- No, she is not shy.
- Okay.

899
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,877
She is shy till she doesn't sing.

900
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:09,918
She sings care freely.
Sing.

901
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:11,318
- Go on.
- Sing.

902
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:14,918
- She is a little shy.
- Yes.

903
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:20,863
"Being with you.."

904
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:26,097
"Our conversations have changed."

905
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,434
- You are amazing, sister-in-law.
- She is great, don't you think"

906
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:29,438
Yes.

907
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,065
- "Mirror.."
- Enough.

908
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,440
Will you sing?

909
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,939
I already sang.

910
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:41,451
No, I am not talking about that.
I mean will you sing with me?

911
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,888
No, mother will thrash me.

912
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:49,049
No worries.

913
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,885
Don't mention your name in it.

914
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,429
There is a solution
to everything these days.

915
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,588
Yes.

916
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:59,133
Look, all the girls who have
delivered hits charge 100,000-150,000.

917
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,462
And I am on a shoestring budget.

918
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:05,235
I can only pay you 3000.

919
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:06,608
3000?

920
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:07,978
Sing a song

921
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:09,038
sing

922
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:11,510
You will pay 3000 for sure?

923
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,018
This is strange, I am not that poor.

924
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,211
After all I am an artist.

925
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,117
I have promised 3000
so I will give you 3000.

926
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:20,351
You can take 1500 as advance.

927
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:22,551
Dance now if you want to..

928
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,118
Later don't complain that
you kick the kitchen fire.

929
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:39,135
"Back off, don't act smart"

930
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,940
"Don't make a wrong match."

931
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:44,539
"Even the ones who act like studs."

932
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:48,142
"Are ready to fulfill
my every whims and fancy."

933
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,019
"You think you are someone great?"

934
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:56,253
"People like you are
available a dime a dozen."

935
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:58,625
"You think you are someone great?"

936
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:01,194
"People like you are
available a dime a dozen."

937
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,665
Hello. Yes?

938
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,329
Okay, you want her to sing?

939
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:07,199
It is difficult.

940
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,038
3000 is a very huge sum for us.

941
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,541
We are having trouble keeping it safe.

942
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:16,940
I don't know how to tell
mother where we got the money from.

943
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:17,606
Yes, thank you.

944
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:23,051
- Thank you. - "Let me spend
some time with father, mother.

945
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:24,345
Laachi..

946
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:29,456
You looked just like that when you came
here the first time after marriage.

947
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:34,158
You forgot? I am yet to get married.

948
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:35,423
God bless you!

949
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:41,565
When are you getting married?

950
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,234
You gave up so soon?

951
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:44,431
ls this only how much you loved me?

952
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:47,475
True lovers kidnap
the bride from the wedding.

953
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,706
Do one thing,
get dressed in your wedding attire.

954
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,014
..and I will come and get you.

955
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:54,976
No, I cannot wear that dress
and get married to someone else.

956
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,321
Thank you,
you at least have that much sense.

957
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,056
Do one thing, then wear this one.

958
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:03,320
You are sure?

959
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,279
- I cannot do it.
- Why?

960
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,478
I am not liking it.

961
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:32,649
I cannot marry anyone else.

962
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,248
Anyone else? Who?

963
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:35,450
We are just pretending, right?

964
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,228
Hey, I never know it with you.

965
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:39,763
You wanted to do it
when I didn't like it.

966
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,156
Now when I have come prepared..

967
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,665
I know what I have
to say and I will say it.

968
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:43,726
So let me do it.

969
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:47,269
I will hit the drummer
and break his drums.

970
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:48,504
You sit.

971
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,437
You sure?

972
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,302
You know what beautiful
things I have memorized to say?

973
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,043
Get ready.

974
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:55,336
Sit down.

975
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:01,278
I am coming.

976
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,121
What are you doing?

977
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:07,548
I have done so much for you!

978
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:10,025
My gifts and your false promises.

979
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,220
Hats off to you.

980
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:12,556
Hats off to you.

981
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:14,620
You are getting married for
the second time and I am still single?

982
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:17,128
Okay?

983
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,404
This is not possible.

984
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:22,666
You cannot deceive me.

985
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,400
You cannot marry him.

986
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,303
Today I have realized
how much you love me.

987
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:28,573
But I am helpless.

988
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:30,272
I have already taken
two vows with him.

989
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:32,509
It's okay. You took two with him
so now take two with me.

990
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,574
- You will end up taking four vows.
- No!

991
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,551
Instead of taking two vows
with you and two with him.

992
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,714
..
 should not belong to any of you.

993
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:42,150
- I'll jump into the well.
- No!

994
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:44,524
I thought why I should
take the trouble of coming back.

995
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:47,758
I should ask you whether
my dress is ready or not.

996
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,390
- Your dress is ready.
- Really?

997
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,093
- Do you know how to swim?
- Yes.

998
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:52,260
Then catch some fishes while in there.

999
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:54,236
- We will eat them when we
will feel hungry at night. - No!

1000
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,830
No one will stop us.

1001
00:57:58,542 --> 00:57:59,634
Why did you stop?

1002
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,470
See for yourself.

1003
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,547
She will kill me.

1004
00:58:04,615 --> 00:58:06,105
Get me down.

1005
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,250
Let me go.

1006
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:17,556
l--

1007
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,794
Mother.

1008
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:31,768
Shouldn't we put a door there?

1009
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,269
That we will know who comes in?

1010
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:35,845
Sure, I'll get it locked too.

1011
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:37,672
That way,
everyone who passes by will knock..

1012
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:39,739
..and also pay you
for entertaining them.

1013
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,845
My daughter's wedding dress?

1014
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,156
What have you done?

1015
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:52,592
Don't worry, aunt.
She will take it off.

1016
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:53,787
- Take it off.
- No way.

1017
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,188
She has ruined it for her.

1018
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,598
My daughter had bought
the dress she desired.

1019
00:58:58,669 --> 00:59:00,433
It is worth 2000 rupees.

1020
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:03,667
It's okay, she just wore it.

1021
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,368
No way!
What will I do with this dress now?

1022
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:07,877
I want cash.

1023
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:09,670
Two thousand rupees.

1024
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,211
There, you wanted to play right?

1025
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,342
First I used to keep running
away from the grocer's shop..

1026
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:16,682
..now I will keep running
away from her house.

1027
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,719
You want me to run from
the entire village, don't you?

1028
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:26,453
No, don't cry.

1029
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:27,596
I will be right back.

1030
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,247
ls it real?

1031
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:47,379
Yes.

1032
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:49,943
See you, sister.

1033
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:51,679
This is a limit.

1034
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,450
What will I tell my daughter?

1035
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,685
From where did you get so much money?

1036
00:59:58,462 --> 00:59:59,952
We didn't tell you
out of fear, mother.

1037
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:04,232
We know that you'd yell when you'll
learn that we have this kind of money.

1038
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,393
- Mother, 
..
- No.

1039
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,869
- Let me tell her.
- Yes, tell me.

1040
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,199
- I have..
- No.

1041
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:09,863
Let me tell her.

1042
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:11,641
- Tell me!
- Go on.

1043
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,706
Mother, I sang a song with someone.

1044
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:16,803
Using an alias.

1045
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,712
You sang with someone?

1046
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:20,375
Didn't you feel ashamed?

1047
01:00:21,418 --> 01:00:23,682
I don't want this nonsense
happening in my household again.

1048
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:25,512
Happy that you told her?

1049
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:28,449
We won't, mother.

1050
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:29,918
We got another call today.

1051
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,658
They said they would
pay 5000 if she sings.

1052
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,828
I told them that we aren't
interested in this nonsense.

1053
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:34,921
Once was enough for us.

1054
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,933
- How much did you say?
- 5000.

1055
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,433
- 5000?
- Yes.

1056
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,670
- There is so much money in
this fifthly business? - Yes.

1057
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:44,872
Then it isn't nonsense.

1058
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:46,643
Sing.

1059
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:51,376
She will make 5000.
You will make 3000.

1060
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:52,677
And I will make 2000.

1061
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:53,614
I too will sing.

1062
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:57,384
Mother, it is difficult to sing.

1063
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,521
It can't be more difficult
than stitching clothes.

1064
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:00,886
I just have to do this.

1065
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:05,992
We will together earn 10,000 a month.

1066
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:08,888
Okay, mother.

1067
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:15,962
When we will leave together,
there comes the singers' family.

1068
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:28,315
"Being with you.."

1069
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:31,480
"Being so close to you.."

1070
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:33,546
"Being so close to you.."

1071
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:38,925
"Our conversations have changed."

1072
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:41,589
"My mirror.."

1073
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:44,498
"My mirror.."

1074
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:50,007
"Your eyes have become my mirror."

1075
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:55,944
"Your eyes have become my mirror."

1076
01:01:56,013 --> 01:02:00,041
Ga-ma..

1077
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:01,978
Gamma?

1078
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:06,816
She never called me
out when we were young.

1079
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,024
Now she keeps taking my name.

1080
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:16,832
"Now my nose ring
shines even brighter."

1081
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:22,431
"
 feel excited when
I think about you."

1082
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,404
No, no, no.

1083
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,031
At least 3000.

1084
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,668
Her voice is precious.

1085
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,540
Hello?

1086
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:30,944
You can't hear me?
Can you hear me now?

1087
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,576
N ow?

1088
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,448
Now can you hear me? Now?

1089
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:37,849
Okay, let's meet in the middle.

1090
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:38,945
Let's finalize at 2900.

1091
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,013
She will do it then.

1092
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:41,919
Dear, there's another booking.

1093
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:42,959
Attend it.

1094
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,823
God bless you, dear.

1095
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,062
Stay blessed.

1096
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:49,895
"Your eyes have become my mirror."

1097
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,663
Ga-ma..
Ga-ma..

1098
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:55,569
Don't, dear. Don't...

1099
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:58,131
Ga-ma..

1100
01:02:58,375 --> 01:02:59,706
Sa-re-ga-ma..

1101
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:03,804
Don't. You have to face God one day.

1102
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:12,682
"Look, I have found my beloved."

1103
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:18,126
"People lie when they
say that love is hard to find."

1104
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:23,561
"People lie when they
say that love is hard to find."

1105
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:29,128
"There are so many
more things to be said.."

1106
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,565
If 3000 is too much then
you can get it done in 2000 too.

1107
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,804
My voice is a little heavy,
but you can hear me out.

1108
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:42,911
- "Your eyes have become my mirror."
- ls 3000 okay with you now?

1109
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,983
Okay, then she will come tomorrow.

1110
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:47,481
You owe me a lot.

1111
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,184
You should keep paying
me in installments. Okay?

1112
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,052
Catch her! Catch her! Catch her!

1113
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:53,620
Shut up!
How much do I owe you?

1114
01:03:53,964 --> 01:03:55,762
75,000 in the principal sum.

1115
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,800
Let me check the interest.

1116
01:03:57,868 --> 01:03:59,666
It must be another 10,000.

1117
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:01,898
You were troubling someone
e
se's wife for 95,000?

1118
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:04,100
- No, 85,000.
- Okay, take 85000.

1119
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,733
- Okay.
- Whatever.

1120
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:08,943
Come over tomorrow and take
the money and have a cold drink too.

1121
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,508
And villagers, this is for you.

1122
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:12,980
If you need money, come over.

1123
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:16,019
My doors are always open for you.

1124
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:23,920
Charge me for this as well.

1125
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:26,656
For this as well.

1126
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:38,002
Laachi has made delicious
carrots and peas dish.

1127
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,901
- Mother.
- Yes?

1128
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,980
You know the song Laachi
had sung.. about moustaches?

1129
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,205
They are making a video on it.

1130
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,214
They want Laachi to act in it.

1131
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:50,844
- They will pay well.
- No, no, no.

1132
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:52,514
It is not a respectable thing to do.

1133
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:57,960
- Mother, are you drunk?
- No.

1134
01:04:58,028 --> 01:04:59,018
You are drunk!

1135
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:01,964
I have been patient all my life.

1136
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:06,264
So what if I got drunk today?

1137
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:07,662
I am haPPV-

1138
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,504
Then be more happy.

1139
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:12,940
Drink some more.

1140
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:14,008
Video..

1141
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:18,644
I told you,
it is not a respectable thing to do.

1142
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:24,118
We have made enough
money to repay the grocer.

1143
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,647
We have to do respectable things.

1144
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,157
We will stitch clothes for others.

1145
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,954
- We will do manual labor.
- Yes.

1146
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,620
We will work in the fields.

1147
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:34,130
Yes, we should stick
to our respectable jobs.

1148
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:39,730
"We will spend the night together."

1149
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:40,770
Go to sleep, ma'am.

1150
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:45,070
- "
 hope this night never ends."
- Sleep.

1151
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,111
I had come at the speed
of 100 to take my money.

1152
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:51,239
Your mother went inside
but didn't come out.

1153
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:52,247
Don't worry, sir.

1154
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,250
- It's her house, she will return
when she wants to. - Yes.

1155
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,582
We have been waiting for
you since morning.

1156
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,601
This doesn't look
like a mouse's burrow.

1157
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,939
We have been robbed!

1158
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:22,772
We are ruined!
We have been robbed!

1159
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:24,143
What happened, mother?

1160
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:25,773
We have been robbed, dear!

1161
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:28,944
Someone dug a hole under
your father's feet and stole it.

1162
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:31,180
He drank himself to death.

1163
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:34,622
I got drunk just one
day and I too got ruined.

1164
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,855
Mother, what will we do now?

1165
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:40,025
Grocer is sitting outside.

1166
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:41,993
Shall we get leave from here?

1167
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:45,330
We will have to tell him the truth.

1168
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:49,230
Mother, I'd suggest
that we should leave.

1169
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:50,965
They didn't spare anything, son.

1170
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,371
They took everything.

1171
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:53,905
Calm down.

1172
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:55,609
Calm down, mother.

1173
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,213
We have been robbed. No one is dead.

1174
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,145
Why are you crying so much?

1175
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:00,740
Someone stole our money.
He will get punished for his sin.

1176
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:03,377
We have been robbed.

1177
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,087
Right.

1178
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:08,987
It is a good scheme.

1179
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:10,624
First invite me home.

1180
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,127
Then say that you have been robbed.

1181
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,027
No, I am telling the truth.

1182
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:15,326
You can see for yourself.

1183
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:18,231
The thieves have dug a hole
as big as your stomach in the wall.

1184
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:20,269
Look at her making excuses.

1185
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,963
I had my doubts.

1186
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,904
How can you manage
to arrange such a huge sum?

1187
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:25,099
You are such a pretentious woman!

1188
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:25,869
Sir!

1189
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,105
Don't insult my mother.

1190
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:32,042
Mother, why did you have to announce
to the village that we have money?

1191
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,410
This village is full of poor people.
Someone must have stolen it.

1192
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,947
Fine, I believe you
that you had the money.

1193
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,251
So, can you tell me
the source of your income?

1194
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:41,186
We have made money by singing

1195
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:41,816
My daughter in law

1196
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:42,721
No, mother. Let it be.

1197
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,225
Let me tell you everything

1198
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,827
No, mother. Let it be.

1199
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,226
Let me tell you everything

1200
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,287
Okay, tell him.

1201
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:51,062
Tell him, dear.
Tell him what all songs have you sung.

1202
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:55,366
"
 hide my face from the elder and offer
milk to the younger brother-in-law."

1203
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:58,100
That one.
And then this one..

1204
01:07:58,141 --> 01:08:00,439
"
 rule your heart."

1205
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:01,734
And then this one..

1206
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,074
"Your beauty makes the traffic stop."

1207
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:04,773
No, I sang the song with sedan.

1208
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:05,781
Yes, it was about cars.

1209
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:08,318
Stop playing games.

1210
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:10,944
I think the whole family has gone mad.

1211
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,153
Listen to me very carefully.

1212
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,721
If you don't pay me
my money back in 15 days.

1213
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:18,328
"then I will take over your house.

1214
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:22,191
I am sure it must be 60,000 at least.

1215
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,995
It is Worth 100,000.

1216
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,332
Have you ever seen 100,000 cash?

1217
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:28,735
"It is Worth 100,000."

1218
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:33,337
Mother, I hope you are
not going towards the well.

1219
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,844
I am going to sit down.

1220
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:43,743
Dear..

1221
01:08:45,155 --> 01:08:47,146
You can do a video
with whomever you want.

1222
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:50,223
You can dance wherever you want.

1223
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:53,219
People will talk about you.

1224
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:56,429
That she is involved
with this or that singer.

1225
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,232
She is stuck with that person.

1226
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:03,502
We just want to make money.

1227
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,205
So that we can teach
that grocer a lesson.

1228
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:09,344
We have to make him dance.

1229
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,806
Get this done and over with.

1230
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:18,279
I want all the respect that
I have lost, back in five years.

1231
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:21,281
I want to be the
headman of this village.

1232
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:24,154
Isn't that too much, mother?

1233
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:27,119
Yes, bro. Hi.

1234
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,025
Shooting is taking place near yours.

1235
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:31,257
If you could come then it
would help me get some respect.

1236
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,200
I just want a selfie with you.

1237
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:37,338
The audio's response is
good that's why I took this risk.

1238
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,366
I am sure it will be
a great hit in no time.

1239
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,870
No, I have five songs in it.
Yes.

1240
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:47,012
People invest their last hope
I've invested my last piece of land.

1241
01:09:47,884 --> 01:09:50,478
I have spent a few hundred
thousands on the lead.

1242
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,485
Yes. Try to understand.

1243
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:54,182
Be a bro and come here.
Okay.

1244
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:57,849
Laachi, move a little
towards the left.

1245
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,493
Yes, no. Correct.

1246
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:01,428
Move a little towards right.

1247
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:03,332
Nice, very nice.

1248
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,194
- Very good.
- Yes.

1249
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:11,231
ls the frame not right?

1250
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:13,141
Frame?

1251
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:15,806
What you see here is called the frame.

1252
01:10:17,147 --> 01:10:18,410
It doesn't look like
family entertainer.

1253
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,379
Laachi, move towards the right.

1254
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,157
Stick to the right.

1255
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:34,587
Action!

1256
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:48,004
- Look at her! She is hot!
- She is hot!

1257
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,101
- Very beautiful.
- Very.

1258
01:10:49,179 --> 01:10:52,376
- Who is hot?
- The one who is dancing is hot.

1259
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:54,479
Don't you have a sister
or a mother at home?

1260
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:57,020
We make them stay at
home and not face the camera.

1261
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,522
She is an artist.
Show some respect.

1262
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,183
- You should worship her.
- Who are you?

1263
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,455
I am her husband.

1264
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:54,038
"Back off, don't act smart"

1265
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:56,943
"Don't make a wrong match."

1266
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:59,607
"Even the ones who act like studs."

1267
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:03,277
"Are ready to fulfill
my every whims and fancy."

1268
01:12:05,255 --> 01:12:08,054
"You think you are someone great?"

1269
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:11,287
"People like you are
available a dime a dozen."

1270
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:13,659
"You think you are someone great?"

1271
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,399
"People like you are
available a dime a dozen."

1272
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:19,197
"
 am a brand in itself."

1273
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:22,034
"Don't mess with me, let it go."

1274
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:24,938
"
 don't say this, but people do.."

1275
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:28,535
"
 am priceless."

1276
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:36,350
"There isn't enough in this
world to put a price on my moustache."

1277
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:41,585
"There isn't enough in this
world to put a price on my moustache."

1278
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,251
200,000 view in 24 hours.

1279
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,456
1000 likes without any dislikes.

1280
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,224
Yes. Look at this.

1281
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:51,733
Now our time will be change.

1282
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:54,299
Shall I call them.

1283
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,032
No, no, no.

1284
01:12:57,173 --> 01:13:01,007
Now we won't call him,
he will call us.

1285
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,043
You just wait and watch.

1286
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:04,036
Here..

1287
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:11,719
"
 have been pampered to
the core by my parents for sure."

1288
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:17,289
"
 am adept and skilled,
I know how to get my work done."

1289
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,193
"Don't assume me to be easy.."

1290
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:23,631
"Only a fortunate one will
adorn this hand with bangles."

1291
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:28,334
"You think you are someone great?"

1292
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:31,568
"People like you are
available a dime a dozen."

1293
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:34,042
"You think you are someone great?"

1294
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:37,445
"People like you are
available a dime a dozen."

1295
01:13:44,387 --> 01:13:45,513
What are you staring at?

1296
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:46,778
Nothing.

1297
01:13:48,358 --> 01:13:51,123
Laachi, you are very good.

1298
01:13:52,328 --> 01:13:53,386
Really.

1299
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,220
When you danced for the video shoot.

1300
01:13:55,698 --> 01:13:59,032
..
 couldn't believe
that you are my wife.

1301
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:01,632
Why are you saying that?

1302
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:03,740
What do you mean by why?
What else should I say?

1303
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:06,401
What's the status of our drama?

1304
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:09,509
How far has our story reached?

1305
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,771
Do I stand a chance?

1306
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:16,747
Answer the phone.

1307
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:23,819
- Hello, who is it?
- Who are you?

1308
01:14:24,427 --> 01:14:26,088
You are the one who called.
So, you tell me.

1309
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:28,256
This is Ajaypal.

1310
01:14:29,365 --> 01:14:31,197
Oh.. I'm Laachi.

1311
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:32,257
Who is it?

1312
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:33,828
Mr. Ajaypal?

1313
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,329
Give him my regards.

1314
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,736
Sorry, I think dialed
your number by mistake.

1315
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:39,571
I was listening to your song.

1316
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,406
So, I think that's
how this call happened.

1317
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:43,170
Sorry, I will hang up now.

1318
01:14:43,246 --> 01:14:45,578
No.. It's okay.

1319
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:47,775
It's not a problem
if it happened by mistake.

1320
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:50,380
We can talk, right?

1321
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:54,289
Sure, we can talk the
whole day if you want.

1322
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:57,855
When I had heard your voice, I had
thought that you'd be very beautiful.

1323
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:04,365
But when I met you, I realized you
are more beautiful than your voice.

1324
01:15:04,434 --> 01:15:05,731
Thank you.

1325
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:09,670
You being such a big artist
are showing such respect to me.

1326
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,474
You know I was very happy to meet you.

1327
01:15:14,744 --> 01:15:16,610
I was wondering,
would you sing with me?

1328
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,408
- Sure.
- You are a very good singer.

1329
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,276
Okay then, come over and
we will discuss the details.

1330
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:23,545
- Sure, I will sing with you.
- How about a festive song?

1331
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:26,583
But not folk song.

1332
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:29,491
Okay then,
I will wait for the dawn to arrive.

1333
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,419
- Laachi, you are..
- Okay, I will come over.

1334
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:08,554
He is here.

1335
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,825
- Hello.
- Hello.

1336
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:16,929
- You are looking very..
- You are looking very..

1337
01:16:17,273 --> 01:16:18,536
You are looking very beautiful..

1338
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:22,905
You are looking very handsome, bro.

1339
01:16:23,179 --> 01:16:23,873
Yes.

1340
01:16:24,847 --> 01:16:26,406
The brooch is very beautiful.

1341
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:28,511
It's a wedding gift from her family.

1342
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:31,381
You two too are looking fine.

1343
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:32,947
Please have a seat.

1344
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:34,779
Sit.

1345
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:42,891
Congratulations on the song.
I had told you that it'd be super hit.

1346
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:45,598
This song is a super
hit because of you.

1347
01:16:45,668 --> 01:16:47,636
No one knows that idiot.

1348
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:52,206
Let's come to the point.
We want to do a song with you.

1349
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,967
Let's do a small contract before that.

1350
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,406
You will get 5% for every show..

1351
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,742
..and a fee of 800,000 for a year.

1352
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:02,412
- How much?
- 800,000.

1353
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,546
We accept it.
We accept it.

1354
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:06,953
I want to discuss something.

1355
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:10,323
You see, these companies
are very annoying.

1356
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:14,630
We want your pair to be a hit.

1357
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:20,360
But for that, it is necessary
that your pair is broken off.

1358
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:24,337
What do you mean?

1359
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:27,242
You got scared?
No, that is not what I meant.

1360
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:30,769
Look, the thing is that if
people learn that she is married..

1361
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:33,508
"then they won't accept their pair.

1362
01:17:40,523 --> 01:17:42,321
I won't divorce her
for 800,000 rupees.

1363
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,285
Who is asking you to divorce her?

1364
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,430
You just need to refrain from
publicly saying that you are married.

1365
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:49,531
This is just a small paperwork.

1366
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:51,464
We will make a new contract next year.

1367
01:17:51,534 --> 01:17:52,831
We don't have to say it publicly.

1368
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:56,634
- Okay, we can do that.
- No, we cannot.

1369
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:57,839
Why not?

1370
01:17:57,907 --> 01:18:00,467
Sometimes people anyway
don't believe that we are married.

1371
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:02,409
I have to show them our wedding video.

1372
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,576
It's okay. We accept the condition.

1373
01:18:05,581 --> 01:18:08,881
Do one thing, get your things
from the village in a day or two.

1374
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:10,783
And shift into my apartment.

1375
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,514
Then we will star-t
working on my album.

1376
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:15,654
We just don't need to say it publicly.

1377
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:17,620
We will stay as husband and wife.

1378
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:20,963
0K8‘!-

1379
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:24,423
Hello?

1380
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,025
This is Jagtar Maan.

1381
01:18:26,669 --> 01:18:28,467
I had sung a song with Laachi?

1382
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:31,334
I thought of giving
her another chance.

1383
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:32,738
<i>She sings well.</i>

1384
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:34,501
I will give her 5100.

1385
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:38,838
No, dear. Laachi no longer
sings with small time singers.

1386
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:41,709
She has been booked
for a year for 800,000.

1387
01:18:42,685 --> 01:18:44,676
You should go look for someone else.

1388
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:52,461
Get them read by someone
else if you want to.

1389
01:18:53,696 --> 01:18:54,754
It's okay.

1390
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:58,695
It just states that we aren't husband
and wife in front of people, right?

1391
01:18:59,802 --> 01:19:01,395
What's the big deal in that?

1392
01:19:21,557 --> 01:19:22,649
Go ahead.

1393
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:23,954
Yes.

1394
01:19:25,628 --> 01:19:27,756
- Tell me, what can I get for you?
- Nothing.

1395
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:30,356
- My life?
- I was just.

1396
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,099
- He is my lyricist.
- Hello.

1397
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:35,770
Out of all the songs that I have done,
95% of them have been penned by him.

1398
01:19:35,838 --> 01:19:37,397
He will tell you the lyrics today.

1399
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,404
Let's begin, brother?
Please have a seat.

1400
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,474
Please have a seat.
Go ahead.

1401
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:43,672
The song and the lyricist from Kokia..

1402
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:47,413
"When I saw that you were
alone near the village square."

1403
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:49,781
"l too all alone busy on my phone."

1404
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:52,080
"When I held your hand.."

1405
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,818
"Your villagers came after me."

1406
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:57,018
"After me!"
Very good.

1407
01:19:57,093 --> 01:19:59,892
"
 bashed them up."

1408
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,123
"All their clothes."

1409
01:20:01,397 --> 01:20:03,661
- "All their clothes were
soaked in blood." - Very good.

1410
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:06,464
- "Desi Crew! Desi Crew! Desi Crew!"
- Excellent!

1411
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:09,800
- Bless you.
- It's a hit. It's a hit. Super hit!

1412
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:13,070
No.

1413
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,770
No, brother.

1414
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:19,572
Something more suitable
for family audiences, huh?

1415
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:21,674
I change this to make it
more suitable for family audiences.

1416
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:23,913
- The bloodshed will go down a notch.
- Okay. Recite it.

1417
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:27,545
"When I saw you with your
family near the village square."

1418
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:30,490
"My family too was there."

1419
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:32,926
"When I held your hand
in front of your fami
y.."

1420
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:36,090
"Your family came after my family."

1421
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,657
"My family bashed them up."

1422
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:42,695
"All their clothes
were soaked in blood."

1423
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,197
How was it?

1424
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:49,604
No, it's okay. All the
six lines were soaked in blood.

1425
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,081
I will make sure that it
is a decent song. Don't worry.

1426
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:58,120
Brother, it is full of bloodshed.
Let's skip it.

1427
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,884
Let's increase the family strength.
The bloodshed will go down.

1428
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:04,787
"Family, my family, happy family..

1429
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,587
- "Fami
y.."
- Forget it.

1430
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,963
- We will do another one.
- Okay.

1431
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:10,528
Go.

1432
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,534
Count it. It's 50,000.

1433
01:21:32,021 --> 01:21:33,716
Do you want me to
sign any other documents?

1434
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:35,522
No.

1435
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:41,827
Do you have a problem with not publicly
announcing about your marriage?

1436
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,490
I mean, I hope you are not worried.

1437
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:45,559
No..

1438
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,795
We often keep saying
that we don't know each other.

1439
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:50,563
Why?

1440
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:53,575
It's nothing.

1441
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:56,771
No, is there a dowry
issue or something?

1442
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,911
No.

1443
01:22:01,984 --> 01:22:04,248
Actually, I have told him that.

1444
01:22:05,187 --> 01:22:06,951
Oh God, how do I explain this?

1445
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:16,824
Actually, I told him, that we'd stay
in the same house, but as strangers.

1446
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,932
Assume that I am sitting
at home doing embroidery..

1447
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:24,573
You should pass through
my house and tease me.

1448
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,299
Make me fall in love with you.

1449
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:29,942
Has he made you fall in love with him?

1450
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:33,674
Not as yet.

1451
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:37,118
- Shall we play the same game?
- No.

1452
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:39,780
I cannot play it with you.

1453
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:42,057
Why? 
..

1454
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:51,829
They have been in there for quite
some time. Laachi hasn't come back.

1455
01:22:53,169 --> 01:22:54,830
They must be selecting songs upstairs.

1456
01:22:56,172 --> 01:22:58,607
Can we see how they select the songs?

1457
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:01,700
Sure, why not.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1458
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,706
My uncle too is a writer.
My mother is learning.

1459
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:44,648
I was telling him about
the pretend game that we play.

1460
01:23:45,621 --> 01:23:50,923
He then was being stubborn like a child
and insisted that he too wants to play.

1461
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:55,389
You know, you should see like he was.

1462
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:56,756
0K8‘!-

1463
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,899
So, you taught him?

1464
01:24:01,904 --> 01:24:03,030
I have signed the documents.

1465
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,965
Once you are free from here,
we'll go for the meeting.

1466
01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:11,936
Let's go.

1467
01:24:13,249 --> 01:24:15,911
We'll stay here tonight.
We don't need to go home.

1468
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,347
Come soon.

1469
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,044
Bye, brother.

1470
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,795
It's such a beautiful house.
Isn't it?

1471
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:38,165
Yes.

1472
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:40,708
Ajaypal is such a nice man, isn't he?

1473
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:42,776
He had changed our world.

1474
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:43,902
Yes.

1475
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:45,071
AiavpaL

1476
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:48,816
- No, Ajitpal. Yes.
- Why Ajitpal?

1477
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:51,914
- I keep saying Ajaypal!
- Yes.

1478
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:54,149
- I hope I don't cast an evil eye on him.
- Okay.

1479
01:24:54,857 --> 01:24:57,417
You know, I told him I would do
a song suitable for family audience.

1480
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,888
But his lyricist could
not write such a song.

1481
01:25:00,963 --> 01:25:03,022
He kept on singing about bloodshed.

1482
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:05,766
Right, they don't
know what family means.

1483
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,433
Don't say that.

1484
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:10,430
They gave us 50,000.

1485
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,909
Can I see the money?

1486
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:15,370
Yes, sure.

1487
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:30,250
If God wills, one day you'll be on a
real jeep and I'll be on a real scooter.

1488
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:32,193
Then we will go on rides.

1489
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:33,928
0K8‘!-

1490
01:25:34,163 --> 01:25:36,427
You must be tired.
Go and have a bath.

1491
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:38,466
I will make us some dinner.

1492
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:40,200
We have to go to their house tomorrow

1493
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,438
Family Song will shoot with family

1494
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:54,076
Okay, father.

1495
01:25:56,218 --> 01:25:58,880
- My son is back.
- How brings him here today?

1496
01:26:06,762 --> 01:26:07,888
This is my family.

1497
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:10,158
- Hello. - From here we will get a
song suitable for family audiences.

1498
01:26:10,933 --> 01:26:12,958
She is the main verse of the song,
my grandma.

1499
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:16,036
The inner verse, my mother.

1500
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:18,070
The sad verse, my sister-in-law.

1501
01:26:18,307 --> 01:26:19,832
Small beats?

1502
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,169
Here's the drum.

1503
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:22,903
Here's the big drum.

1504
01:26:23,479 --> 01:26:25,038
He has all instruments at home.

1505
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:28,913
Back off. He has turned
his family into an orchestra.

1506
01:26:28,984 --> 01:26:30,509
Bloody harmonium.

1507
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:33,317
Son, who are they?

1508
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:35,446
Grandma,
he writes family oriented songs.

1509
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,458
I'm Baldev Singh Parvarkar.

1510
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:40,359
I am very family oriented.
I have three families.

1511
01:26:40,429 --> 01:26:42,295
Two in Ludhiana and one in Moga.

1512
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:44,059
And this beautiful girl?

1513
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,429
- That's Laachi. She's a singer.
- Hello.

1514
01:26:46,902 --> 01:26:48,427
And who is this ugly fellow?

1515
01:26:50,072 --> 01:26:51,301

.. I am her..

1516
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:52,863
Her manager.

1517
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:55,535
Okay, the one who handles the money.
Like an accountant?

1518
01:26:55,811 --> 01:26:56,937
No..

1519
01:26:57,246 --> 01:27:00,216
You should do some manual
labor at least. Like polish shoes?

1520
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:05,184
I too was wondering that such
a beautiful couldn't be married.

1521
01:27:05,254 --> 01:27:07,279
She is so beautiful.

1522
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:09,188
I am so hEPPY!

1523
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,817
- Grandma!
- What is it, son?

1524
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:12,293
Have you never seen
a beautiful girl before?

1525
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:16,862
Mother, how's your cough?

1526
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:19,094
- My cough?
- You weren't coughing.

1527
01:27:19,168 --> 01:27:21,296
Who was coughing?
Father, how's your cough?

1528
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:25,437
What is wrong with me?
Oh yes, I have a sore throat.

1529
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:29,205
Meet me alone and I'll
tell you what meds I am taking.

1530
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:31,537
You don't take care of them?

1531
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,574
- I spoke to them over phone.
- Okay.

1532
01:27:33,849 --> 01:27:35,578
He was coughing.
I don't know who coughed.

1533
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:38,920
More people come in the family come

1534
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:40,980
Bye.

1535
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:44,889
I wanted to write a family oriented.

1536
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,190
Tell me about your life.

1537
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:52,429
Which life is better? Before
marriage life or after marriage?

1538
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:58,929
Look, at first I thought that my life
would get better after I get married.

1539
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:02,935
And now I feel that my life
was better before I got married.

1540
01:28:03,312 --> 01:28:07,146
So do the math. I have always had
it tough, before and after marriage.

1541
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:12,646
I liked your family.

1542
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:14,352
They are very nice.

1543
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:15,914
You brought me here to say this?

1544
01:28:16,058 --> 01:28:16,957
No.

1545
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:21,190
We didn't have to say it
publicly that Laachi is my wife.

1546
01:28:21,363 --> 01:28:23,195
But why did you have
to hide it from your family?

1547
01:28:23,265 --> 01:28:24,892
You made me her manager?

1548
01:28:26,935 --> 01:28:28,528
You know my father
is a newspaper reporter?

1549
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:32,368
If he learnt the truth, the news will
spread all across Punjab like wild fire.

1550
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:35,636
He has never written in my favor.
Instead, he leaked two of my songs.

1551
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:37,409
<i>NV!</i>

1552
01:28:37,546 --> 01:28:38,479
Coming!

1553
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:44,676
Dear, should I tell you
how naughty Ajaypal was as a kid?

1554
01:28:45,187 --> 01:28:47,588
He used to play dollhouse
with his sisters.

1555
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,650
Once he got the neighbor's doll home.

1556
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:54,294
And he hid it.
She was just like you.

1557
01:28:54,363 --> 01:28:55,558
Just like you.

1558
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:58,132
Stop peeling these carrots and peas.
Come, I will show you the fields.

1559
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,326
Let's go.

1560
01:28:59,401 --> 01:29:00,425
Go, dear.

1561
01:29:02,404 --> 01:29:03,929
Where to?

1562
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,475
We were going to the pumping station.

1563
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:10,570
- I too will come along.
- What will you do there, son?

1564
01:29:11,246 --> 01:29:12,213
You guys 9°-

1565
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,338
Let him come along.

1566
01:29:13,415 --> 01:29:16,646
I wouldn't mind dear, but three people
shouldn't leave the house together.

1567
01:29:16,718 --> 01:29:18,186
- Come here.
- Let's go.

1568
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:22,118
Go. Come here, son.
Come, sit over here.

1569
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,988
Here, peel the carrots.

1570
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:29,528
Son..
How is her family?

1571
01:29:30,432 --> 01:29:31,399
Why do you want to
know about her family?

1572
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:33,992
What if I want to bring her home?

1573
01:29:38,607 --> 01:29:39,540
Her family is nice.

1574
01:29:39,608 --> 01:29:41,076
- Okay. - Okay.
- Yes.

1575
01:29:42,411 --> 01:29:44,311
Her family is into manual labor.

1576
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:45,676
- Okay.
- Yes.

1577
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:48,045
The dancers who dance at the weddings.

1578
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,082
He is one of them.

1579
01:29:52,421 --> 01:29:54,185
Her mother too is
very self-respecting.

1580
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:58,424
As there was no food at home,
she refused to stay.

1581
01:29:59,595 --> 01:30:01,529
Then it is a very bad family, son.

1582
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:04,256
Very bad?
I don't know. I don't interfere.

1583
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:05,424
Tell me about it.

1584
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:11,200
She has so many sorrows in her life.
But yet, she is always smiling.

1585
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,775
Grandma, such a girl should
be a pan of our family.

1586
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:18,237
She will hide our
sorrows behind her smile.

1587
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:21,276
Your family too is
very self-respecting.

1588
01:30:22,551 --> 01:30:25,418
I sometimes just want
to give up singing..

1589
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:27,114
...and star-t working
in the fields with father.

1590
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:30,786
And my wife would help
my mother in the kitchen.

1591
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,252
Then we would get
separated after some time.

1592
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:39,325
Why? Why get separated?
Your family is so nice.

1593
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:41,229
You liked my family?

1594
01:30:41,803 --> 01:30:43,328
So, I should never
get separated from them?

1595
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:45,206
Never.

1596
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,502
We should stay together, right?

1597
01:30:46,575 --> 01:30:49,067
And never interfere
if your parents fight.

1598
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:54,279
But then I wonder, who will that
poor girl cook for so many people?

1599
01:30:54,349 --> 01:30:55,407
She will be hassled.

1600
01:30:55,484 --> 01:30:57,543
Why? What's difficult in that?

1601
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:02,087
If they keep her happy then
I am sure she can cook for them.

1602
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:05,282
And what if they eat a lot?

1603
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:10,793
Let's play the pretend game?

1604
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:14,692
You pretend to be a married woman
and I'll pretend to be a crazy Jat.

1605
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:30,309
Hello.

1606
01:31:30,385 --> 01:31:31,750
Hi.

1607
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,788
Do reporters need to have a gun?

1608
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:35,721
Who told you that
I am a news reporter?

1609
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:37,851
Where did you read my article?

1610
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:40,727
Your son told me
that you are a reporter.

1611
01:31:41,263 --> 01:31:42,560
He is lying.

1612
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:44,526
Why would he lie to me?

1613
01:31:44,766 --> 01:31:47,758
He is a liar.
He cannot be respected or trusted.

1614
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,600
Leaving his 100 acres of land behind.

1615
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:52,402
..he dances at other
people's wedding for 800,000.

1616
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:54,272
What's 800,000, peanuts?

1617
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:55,633
no

1618
01:31:55,744 --> 01:31:57,178
Bloody loser.

1619
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:59,270
800,000 is nothing.

1620
01:32:00,449 --> 01:32:02,178
You can buy a cycle with it.

1621
01:32:02,484 --> 01:32:06,421
It's not such a small figure either.
You get tired counting.

1622
01:32:06,655 --> 01:32:08,180
Have you ever seen 800,000?

1623
01:32:08,223 --> 01:32:13,184
Still, is it a respectable thing to
dance at anyone's wedding for 800,000?

1624
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:14,695
If he doesn't care
about his reputation.

1625
01:32:14,763 --> 01:32:16,197
..he should at least
think about his father's.

1626
01:32:16,264 --> 01:32:19,723
Don't make me talk.
He talks about respect.

1627
01:32:20,168 --> 01:32:23,331
Son, he brought home
someone's betrothal.

1628
01:32:23,405 --> 01:32:26,739
How can you compete with my grandson?
He is so decent.

1629
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:31,846
Mother, he only looks decent.
I married someone's betrothal.

1630
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:33,711
He will marry someone's wife!

1631
01:32:34,683 --> 01:32:36,173
Why?

1632
01:32:37,185 --> 01:32:38,346
Why would he bring
home a married woman?

1633
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:41,321
No, son. Why would we get
him married to a married woman?

1634
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:42,651
Right.

1635
01:32:43,692 --> 01:32:46,889
- There he is.
- We will bring someone like her home.

1636
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:54,666
- Why her?
- Why, is she your daughter-in-law?

1637
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,164
You don't want my
grandson to get married?

1638
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,809
How did you like our fields, dear?

1639
01:33:02,844 --> 01:33:06,405
They are good. Only religious
organizations have so much land.

1640
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,181
I want to know about your family.

1641
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,953
I want to bring the
family together in my song.

1642
01:33:18,627 --> 01:33:20,527
I have been married for 27 years.

1643
01:33:20,662 --> 01:33:23,597
I still couldn't
get my family together

1644
01:33:23,665 --> 01:33:25,963
And you want to do that in
a song that's just three minutes long.

1645
01:33:26,234 --> 01:33:31,900
In three minutes, you won't even
be able to get a wife together.

1646
01:33:32,841 --> 01:33:34,309
Want a drink?

1647
01:33:34,843 --> 01:33:36,709
Sure, a family size.

1648
01:33:38,246 --> 01:33:41,341
Your gun will give me the strength.

1649
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:44,775
Litsen

1650
01:33:45,587 --> 01:33:48,784
They aren't good people.
They look good.

1651
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:52,853
- Aiaypal, he..
- Why?

1652
01:33:53,595 --> 01:33:55,427
What did Ajitpal do?

1653
01:33:55,597 --> 01:33:57,929
Ajit. Ajaypa
__

1654
01:33:57,999 --> 01:33:59,865
- Laachi..
- Yes?

1655
01:34:00,535 --> 01:34:02,799
- Go to sleep. Good girl.
- Okay.

1656
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:07,297
Laachi..

1657
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,301
- Be careful..
- Shut up.

1658
01:34:11,947 --> 01:34:13,881
Who signed on the documents?

1659
01:34:16,551 --> 01:34:18,952
Let me know if you feel scared.

1660
01:34:19,354 --> 01:34:21,686
Why would she tell you? Are we dead?

1661
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,848
She will tell me,
she will tell my son.

1662
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:26,928
Mother, when a person is scared,
he can tell anyone, right?

1663
01:34:27,295 --> 01:34:28,763
Shut up.

1664
01:34:33,602 --> 01:34:34,296
got it

1665
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:38,704
Got it, grandma.
I got a nice family oriented song.

1666
01:34:38,873 --> 01:34:40,432
Recite it.

1667
01:34:40,775 --> 01:34:42,709
I cannot recite it
in front of the family.

1668
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:44,404
I can only recite
it when you are alone.

1669
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:47,312
Mr. Parvarkar,
what such family oriented song..

1670
01:34:47,382 --> 01:34:49,544
..have you penned which you
cannot recite in front of a family?

1671
01:34:49,618 --> 01:34:52,451
There are many such family
oriented songs, father.

1672
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,852
"Brother-in-law,
you are eyeing your wife's sister."

1673
01:34:54,923 --> 01:34:56,755
Here they are talking about Brother-in-law
and his wife's sister, right?

1674
01:34:56,825 --> 01:34:58,520
But you cannot listen
to it with your family, right?

1675
01:34:58,593 --> 01:34:59,754
What are you saying?

1676
01:35:02,397 --> 01:35:03,364
That's not the song.

1677
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:05,661
It's.. "You are eyeing your
wife's sister, oh brother-in-law."

1678
01:35:05,734 --> 01:35:07,600
You duffer, it's not that.
It's goes like this.

1679
01:35:07,669 --> 01:35:09,535
"Brother-in-law,
you are eyeing your wife's sister."

1680
01:35:09,571 --> 01:35:10,868
Brother-in-law comes first.

1681
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:13,374
- Father, first it's the wife's sister.
- Brother-in-law comes first.

1682
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:15,569
- First it's the wife's sister.
- Brother-in-law comes first.

1683
01:35:15,644 --> 01:35:16,907
I say so from the
experience of my life.

1684
01:35:16,978 --> 01:35:20,039
Shut up. You have great experiences.
You don't have any shame.

1685
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:22,509
Listen to him blabber.
There is a young girl sitting here.

1686
01:35:22,584 --> 01:35:24,382
You should have recited it there
itself. Why did you make me come here?

1687
01:35:24,452 --> 01:35:25,010
What such family oriented song..

1688
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,053
..have you penned which you
cannot recite in front of a family?

1689
01:35:26,321 --> 01:35:27,083
I would have recited
it in front of a family.

1690
01:35:27,355 --> 01:35:28,720
..if I had penned something down.

1691
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:30,482
Brother, I am begging to you.

1692
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:32,356
Taking your family's
situation into consideration.

1693
01:35:32,427 --> 01:35:36,091
"forget me, even Baba
Bulleh Shah would write this.

1694
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:38,899
"The time has come, God."

1695
01:35:39,534 --> 01:35:41,730
Dear, sing us one of your songs.

1696
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:44,099
No.

1697
01:35:44,506 --> 01:35:46,873
Hey, why are you
looking at the manager?

1698
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:50,639
I will break his neck
if he says anything to you.

1699
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:53,577
Dear, sing us one of your songs.

1700
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:56,915
"You are Laung and I am Laachi."

1701
01:35:56,985 --> 01:35:59,477
"I am lost in your love."

1702
01:35:59,554 --> 01:36:04,014
"Your love stole
my delicate hear-t away."

1703
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:08,825
"
 am the shadow produced
by the mountains of Chambe."

1704
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:14,529
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

1705
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:16,596
Very good.

1706
01:36:16,671 --> 01:36:18,366
It is a very good song.

1707
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:20,702
- Let's sing this song together.
- Really?

1708
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:23,972
Yes, a song which you can hear with
your family is a family oriented song.

1709
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:25,570
Yes, it would be great.

1710
01:36:25,647 --> 01:36:28,514
Did any of the family members
found any word objectionable?

1711
01:36:28,917 --> 01:36:31,079
Well, the song is good.

1712
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:34,416
But she has used shackles
in the song twice.

1713
01:36:34,556 --> 01:36:37,548
- I hope no one misunderstands it.
- Shackle don't know.

1714
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:40,888
Shackle is like a leash.

1715
01:36:41,563 --> 01:36:43,122
Forget it if you don't know.

1716
01:36:43,665 --> 01:36:45,997
Dear, it is a very sweet song.

1717
01:36:46,568 --> 01:36:47,933
You should sing this song.

1718
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:50,663
Your album should
be called Laung Laachi.

1719
01:36:50,872 --> 01:36:52,806
You are Laung and she is Laachi.

1720
01:36:52,874 --> 01:36:54,899
Yes. It's great, isn't it?

1721
01:37:08,089 --> 01:37:10,956
"You are Laung and I am Laachi."

1722
01:37:11,025 --> 01:37:13,790
"I am lost in your love."

1723
01:37:17,966 --> 01:37:20,833
"You are Laung and I am Laachi."

1724
01:37:20,902 --> 01:37:23,428
"I am lost in your love."

1725
01:37:23,505 --> 01:37:28,033
"Your love stole
my delicate hear-t away."

1726
01:37:28,109 --> 01:37:32,774
"Your love stole
my delicate hear-t away."

1727
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:37,580
"
 am the shadow produced
by the mountains of Chambe."

1728
01:37:37,652 --> 01:37:42,180
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

1729
01:37:42,524 --> 01:37:47,462
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

1730
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:52,932
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

1731
01:38:01,943 --> 01:38:04,537
"My feet are so pretty."

1732
01:38:04,579 --> 01:38:06,980
"You keep going to the city."

1733
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:09,517
"
 don't ask for too much."

1734
01:38:09,584 --> 01:38:12,849
"Just buy me anklets that
don't cost a lot of bucks."

1735
01:38:13,821 --> 01:38:16,620
"My feet are so pretty."

1736
01:38:16,691 --> 01:38:19,092
"You keep going to the city."

1737
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,720
"
 don't ask for too much."

1738
01:38:21,796 --> 01:38:24,265
"Just buy me anklets that
don't cost a lot of bucks."

1739
01:38:24,532 --> 01:38:28,935
"They are easily available
for a low price."

1740
01:38:29,003 --> 01:38:33,804
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

1741
01:38:33,875 --> 01:38:38,711
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

1742
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:44,082
"
 hide your name in my eyes."

1743
01:39:17,919 --> 01:39:19,944
The pair of Laung Laachi
is a hit in the music world.

1744
01:39:20,021 --> 01:39:21,682
"but when will they
get together in real life?

1745
01:39:21,856 --> 01:39:22,948
Everyone wants to know.

1746
01:39:29,164 --> 01:39:31,258
At the moment,
we are very good friends.

1747
01:39:31,599 --> 01:39:33,795
We have a lot of work to do together.

1748
01:39:34,035 --> 01:39:36,697
We have a tour in Canada next month.

1749
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:39,133
- I'm late..
- Who are you?

1750
01:39:39,207 --> 01:39:40,902
We then have a few small jobs.

1751
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:43,774
- You didn't recognize me? I am Mehnga.
- Next, we wi

..

1752
01:39:43,845 --> 01:39:47,247
We don't know whether you are
cheap or expensive. We don't know you.

1753
01:39:47,749 --> 01:39:49,012
I am Laachi's husband.

1754
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:51,108
She isn't married, stop lying, man.

1755
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:53,143
I will keep giving you updates.

1756
01:39:53,221 --> 01:39:56,247
Laachi!
Tell them that I am your husband.

1757
01:39:56,324 --> 01:40:00,056
- Laachi, tell them.
- Let's go out. Come on.

1758
01:40:00,762 --> 01:40:02,230
Laachi, Tell these people I am your husband

1759
01:40:03,731 --> 01:40:06,325
- Laachi! Laachi! Laachi!
- Let's go!

1760
01:40:07,301 --> 01:40:08,962
Next question?

1761
01:40:17,612 --> 01:40:18,841
Laachi?

1762
01:40:19,214 --> 01:40:21,205
Why didn't you tell
them that I am your husband?

1763
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:24,883
Oh no.
You are still stuck at that?

1764
01:40:25,286 --> 01:40:27,846
What else could I do?
I should have gone against the law?

1765
01:40:28,156 --> 01:40:31,057
They would have gotten us arrested.
For fraud.

1766
01:40:31,292 --> 01:40:34,887
Then at least tell the one
who pushed me that I am your husband.

1767
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:36,791
You are only thinking about that.

1768
01:40:37,231 --> 01:40:39,825
You didn't even notice
that I am going to Canada.

1769
01:40:39,934 --> 01:40:41,197
I noticed.

1770
01:40:41,902 --> 01:40:43,267
That you are going alone.

1771
01:40:44,138 --> 01:40:45,765
Why are you not taking me with you?

1772
01:40:46,774 --> 01:40:47,900
You'll have to buy a ticket.

1773
01:40:48,109 --> 01:40:49,838
It costs a few hundred thousands.

1774
01:40:50,111 --> 01:40:52,341
He is taking me along.
Isn't that enough?

1775
01:40:52,747 --> 01:40:55,808
I will get a chance to go to Canada.
And I will also make us some money.

1776
01:40:56,951 --> 01:41:01,252
I have never met such
nice people in my life.

1777
01:41:05,193 --> 01:41:06,888
I don't know when you will understand.

1778
01:41:08,263 --> 01:41:09,697
No one is nice.

1779
01:41:13,267 --> 01:41:16,168
Good that you got a visa only for her.

1780
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:19,100
It's a 45 days tour.

1781
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:21,098
We will have fun.

1782
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:26,876
Hello?

1783
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:30,909
Why do you look so sad?

1784
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:33,952
We will take you along
when we got to Sri Lanka.

1785
01:41:47,468 --> 01:41:50,403
Bye, Mehnga.
See you after 45 days?

1786
01:41:50,905 --> 01:41:54,432
Take care. And don't you worry.
We will take good care of Laachi.

1787
01:41:55,744 --> 01:41:57,872
Bye. Take care.

1788
01:42:01,015 --> 01:42:02,005
Bye.

1789
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:04,882
Take care, okay?

1790
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:07,780
Have fun.

1791
01:42:08,189 --> 01:42:10,749
You too take care
of yourself and mother.

1792
01:42:11,426 --> 01:42:14,225
I have made carrot and peas,
make sure you eat them.

1793
01:42:14,896 --> 01:42:15,886
0K8‘!-

1794
01:42:16,497 --> 01:42:17,965
Listen.

1795
01:42:20,368 --> 01:42:22,063
Don't put your hand
out of the plane's window.

1796
01:42:24,339 --> 01:42:25,807
Okay, I won't.

1797
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:56,898
My daughter in law is in Canada

1798
01:42:56,971 --> 01:42:58,496
Now i want to become a headwoman.

1799
01:42:58,873 --> 01:43:01,137
What can I say? My words won't
be able to express my feelings.

1800
01:43:01,275 --> 01:43:03,403
Now you have to make me the headwoman.

1801
01:43:03,478 --> 01:43:05,378
As long as the compensation
is considered.

1802
01:43:05,446 --> 01:43:08,848
...I'd give 500 for the
trouble of casting your vote.

1803
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:09,849
Okay?

1804
01:43:10,018 --> 01:43:12,919
Aunt, you don't need to talk about it.

1805
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:17,887
He is my guide. I will vote
for the one whom he asks me to.

1806
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:21,493
As far as I am concerned,
I have never voted.

1807
01:43:22,062 --> 01:43:24,190
All my votes belong to you.

1808
01:43:24,265 --> 01:43:27,530
Then you alone have 20 votes in hand?

1809
01:43:28,169 --> 01:43:29,500
Thank you, brother.

1810
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:30,901
Brother?

1811
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,433
I never stood a chance.

1812
01:43:33,942 --> 01:43:35,876
It I did, then I would have scored.

1813
01:43:36,344 --> 01:43:39,336
I made a mistake.
A very big mistake.

1814
01:43:39,414 --> 01:43:41,815
Why didn't I try?

1815
01:43:41,983 --> 01:43:43,144
Hello?

1816
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,276
- Hello?
- Yes, Laachi.

1817
01:43:46,087 --> 01:43:48,454
Laachi, I couldn't get through
your number. It has been three days.

1818
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:52,087
I was traveling.
You didn't go to sleep as yet?

1819
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:55,352
Well, 
.. it's afternoon out here.

1820
01:43:55,429 --> 01:43:57,022
It's nighttime there.

1821
01:43:57,265 --> 01:43:58,824
It's night over there?

1822
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:02,332
That's why these two
countries are so different.

1823
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:07,235
Can I call you back?
Ajaypal is in my room.

1824
01:44:07,374 --> 01:44:09,240
Oh.
Why at this hour?

1825
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:15,105
We are preparing for the function.
That's why he is here.

1826
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:17,418
I'll call you back in some time.

1827
01:44:18,018 --> 01:44:19,383
Okay, but.

1828
01:45:03,965 --> 01:45:07,162
Here's another song for you.
The song and the lyricist from Kokia..

1829
01:45:08,102 --> 01:45:10,969
"Where did you go after
hurting my feelings?"

1830
01:45:11,172 --> 01:45:15,075
"Where do I throw your ring?"

1831
01:45:15,143 --> 01:45:20,309
"When I pondered,
I realized that you are a cheat."

1832
01:45:20,514 --> 01:45:25,953
"
 was scared of losing you.
But you ended up deceiving me."

1833
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:31,182
"
 was scared of losing you.
But you ended up deceiving me."

1834
01:45:31,959 --> 01:45:34,155
No, we cannot blame the girl.

1835
01:45:34,228 --> 01:45:35,696
She might be innocent.

1836
01:45:36,197 --> 01:45:38,097
She might have been trapped?

1837
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:41,295
No one is innocent here.
It takes two hands to applaud.

1838
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:45,631
What do you have to do with an
applaud? You keep singing sad songs.

1839
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:48,008
I live for applauds, sir.

1840
01:45:48,676 --> 01:45:50,644
now sing

1841
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:11,260
Very good.
Note it down.

1842
01:46:15,102 --> 01:46:17,196
It has pain,
but it didn't have any words in it.

1843
01:46:18,339 --> 01:46:21,570
Wonderful. There's one.
The song and the lyricist from Kokia..

1844
01:46:22,276 --> 01:46:28,010
The rockets fired by Russia doomed us.

1845
01:46:28,082 --> 01:46:33,486
The rockets fired by Russia doomed us.

1846
01:46:33,554 --> 01:46:39,323
You take flyovers now, while
I am doomed by the railway crossings.

1847
01:46:40,694 --> 01:46:43,095
Can't it be while I am
doomed with your pretense?

1848
01:46:53,708 --> 01:46:55,767
Feeling sad at the pumping station.

1849
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:00,270
You know what?

1850
01:47:01,048 --> 01:47:03,642
I'll tell you because you came.

1851
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:08,780
Today I learn for whom he
waited for two hours at the shooting.

1852
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:12,281
He is not a good person.

1853
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:14,258
That's why he is wandering in Canada.

1854
01:47:14,562 --> 01:47:15,688
He has no future.

1855
01:47:16,731 --> 01:47:18,392
Can I give you a good advice?

1856
01:47:18,466 --> 01:47:22,096
Sister-in-law went to Canada
by implementing a great formula.

1857
01:47:23,337 --> 01:47:25,032
At least save whatever you can.

1858
01:47:27,542 --> 01:47:29,442
Shall I sing a sad song for you?

1859
01:47:30,411 --> 01:47:33,278
No thank you, brother.
I'll go home and hear one.

1860
01:47:35,049 --> 01:47:38,781
"If you don't want to come back."

1861
01:47:39,053 --> 01:47:42,182
"Then send me a phone
after you go to Canada."

1862
01:47:43,324 --> 01:47:45,383
What an appreciate
song for the situation.

1863
01:47:45,592 --> 01:47:48,527
Oh my! How's my Laung
and Laachi doing?

1864
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:50,461
Son, I want to talk to Laachi.

1865
01:47:50,531 --> 01:47:53,125
- I too want to talk to her.
- Oh my baby, my child..

1866
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:54,832
How are you, son?

1867
01:47:55,502 --> 01:47:57,061
Do you want to talk to father?

1868
01:47:57,137 --> 01:47:59,731
- He doesn't.
- I am not eager either.

1869
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:02,139
We were longing to talk to you.

1870
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:03,777
Really?

1871
01:48:04,545 --> 01:48:06,240
Okay, okay, okay.

1872
01:48:07,548 --> 01:48:12,247
"
 am fed up of your daily excuses."

1873
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:19,848
"
 dissolve your memories
like ice in my drink and get drunk."

1874
01:48:20,128 --> 01:48:22,654
"
 dissolve your memories
like ice in my drink.."

1875
01:48:23,731 --> 01:48:25,358
"And get drunk."

1876
01:49:55,522 --> 01:49:58,514
What are you staring at?
I look different, don't l?

1877
01:49:59,827 --> 01:50:01,693
Yes. A lot.

1878
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:04,420
You too have changed a lot.

1879
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:08,800
Yes, I have.

1880
01:50:10,804 --> 01:50:11,965
But I am still standing there.

1881
01:50:20,414 --> 01:50:21,404
How are you, brother?

1882
01:50:21,481 --> 01:50:23,779
I am fine, bro. You are looking good.
What's the occasion?

1883
01:50:23,918 --> 01:50:24,976
Are you going for a wedding somewhere?

1884
01:50:31,259 --> 01:50:32,749
How were the shows?

1885
01:50:34,361 --> 01:50:36,853
They were great.
Laachi, tell him, how were our shows?

1886
01:50:37,264 --> 01:50:39,790
- They were great.
- Everyone was cheering for us!

1887
01:50:39,867 --> 01:50:42,632
Laung Laachi! Laung Laachi!
Everyone from Englishmen to Japanese.

1888
01:50:42,703 --> 01:50:43,932
Once they saw us sitting together.

1889
01:50:44,005 --> 01:50:46,235
- ..they said that we look good together.
- Yes.

1890
01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:48,365
In fact, we have also been offered a film.
What is the name of that movie?

1891
01:50:48,442 --> 01:50:50,638
Oh my dear, what have you
done to yourself in my absence?

1892
01:50:54,915 --> 01:50:56,815
It's the name of the movie, bro.

1893
01:50:56,884 --> 01:50:58,978
What have you done to
yourself in my absence, dear?

1894
01:50:59,253 --> 01:50:59,981
Yes.

1895
01:51:00,254 --> 01:51:02,655
Shooting will take place
for 30 days Canada and 15 days here.

1896
01:51:02,723 --> 01:51:04,350
Yes, we will be going back to Canada.

1897
01:51:04,425 --> 01:51:06,553
Yes. We wanted you to give
the clap of the first shot.

1898
01:51:11,598 --> 01:51:12,895
Open the boot, brother.

1899
01:51:20,808 --> 01:51:22,367
You are very happy-

1900
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:26,002
Yes. My Canada's tour was very good.

1901
01:51:27,781 --> 01:51:30,580
I didn't really realize
how quickly 45 days got over.

1902
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:35,717
Go to sleep.
I won't fall asleep so soon.

1903
01:51:36,957 --> 01:51:38,049
Why?

1904
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:41,355
You are no longer my habit

1905
01:51:42,396 --> 01:51:45,297
Oh no.
I am used to that place now.

1906
01:51:45,466 --> 01:51:47,525
When it's night here,
it's daytime over there, right?

1907
01:51:47,768 --> 01:51:48,929
I know.

1908
01:51:49,804 --> 01:51:50,965
When the sun hides here

1909
01:51:51,872 --> 01:51:52,964
there the sun rises

1910
01:51:55,075 --> 01:51:58,670
Hides here behind a poor house

1911
01:52:00,581 --> 01:52:02,777
there in the garden...

1912
01:52:05,619 --> 01:52:07,815
There is no conscience

1913
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:16,454
The first scene of the movie..

1914
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:18,624
At the ruins at the
outskirts of the village.

1915
01:52:19,099 --> 01:52:20,863
Get out of the ruins already.

1916
01:52:20,935 --> 01:52:22,835
We need to shoot the maximum
movie in Canada.

1917
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:25,667
- Talk about Canada. - Sir, then we
will shift the ruins to Canada.

1918
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:27,405
Okay?

1919
01:52:29,676 --> 01:52:30,609
Hello.

1920
01:52:31,445 --> 01:52:33,038
- Hello.
- Hi.

1921
01:52:33,113 --> 01:52:35,673
We all were missing you a lot.

1922
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:39,815
We didn't sleep last night.
We didn't even eat.

1923
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:41,886
We were working on
scripfs narration for you.

1924
01:52:41,956 --> 01:52:43,617
- Oh really?
- Yes.

1925
01:52:45,793 --> 01:52:49,696
Sir, the best scene in the movie. Both
the girl and the boy are in Canada.

1926
01:52:49,997 --> 01:52:51,431
why we go to canada

1927
01:52:51,498 --> 01:52:52,397
Can also make here

1928
01:52:52,766 --> 01:52:54,962
What's the use of making
the movie if she can't go to Canada?

1929
01:52:55,035 --> 01:52:56,400
Keep quiet.

1930
01:52:57,037 --> 01:52:59,802
You don't know anything.
You keep interfering for no reason.

1931
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:04,036
Here are your dresses.
See, which one do you like.

1932
01:53:05,779 --> 01:53:06,769
This one is better.

1933
01:53:07,481 --> 01:53:09,472
Pink.. I think so is better.

1934
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:10,711
- Pink is very nice.
- This is nice.

1935
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:11,615
Pink suits you.

1936
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:13,947
- Whatever Ajaypal says.
- This one is very nice, Laachi.

1937
01:53:14,454 --> 01:53:15,944
- No.
- Pink is very nice.

1938
01:53:16,123 --> 01:53:17,022
Pink?

1939
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:20,021
Try it on. Check it out.

1940
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:23,452
If you do not like my favorite

1941
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:25,621
Why did you bring me

1942
01:53:33,407 --> 01:53:34,704
Come for the shoot tomorrow morning.

1943
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:36,572
What's the name of the movie?

1944
01:53:37,077 --> 01:53:38,772
Oh my dear, what have you
done to yourself in my absence?

1945
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:40,177
Yes. That's a good boy.

1946
01:53:40,448 --> 01:53:41,506
He remembers.

1947
01:53:43,751 --> 01:53:45,845
Oh my dear, what have you
done to yourself in my absence?

1948
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,081
First shot.

1949
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:49,816
Get out of the frame!

1950
01:53:50,457 --> 01:53:52,050
Why are you walking
in front of them? Go back!

1951
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,820
Move to the side!

1952
01:53:54,094 --> 01:53:56,722
Get out of the frame!
Action!

1953
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:03,137
Go! I am tired of holding the mike.

1954
01:54:05,573 --> 01:54:06,131
Enough.

1955
01:54:28,795 --> 01:54:30,456
Laachi!

1956
01:54:30,631 --> 01:54:33,862
- Who is he? Why is he interrupting?
- What is wrong?

1957
01:54:34,067 --> 01:54:35,466
We are just pretending.

1958
01:54:35,669 --> 01:54:36,898
This is acting?

1959
01:54:38,205 --> 01:54:40,037
When you were doing
it with a wooden doll..

1960
01:54:40,207 --> 01:54:42,539
..you got scared and came back to me.

1961
01:54:43,544 --> 01:54:47,742
If you are still feel
scared then you can come to me.

1962
01:54:48,615 --> 01:54:50,583
They got it, they won't let it go.

1963
01:54:50,651 --> 01:54:53,643
Give me a hug and go back.
Then you can exchange the rings.

1964
01:54:54,021 --> 01:54:55,113
What's happening?

1965
01:54:55,189 --> 01:54:56,623
I am her husband!

1966
01:54:57,157 --> 01:54:58,591
Who is he?

1967
01:54:58,759 --> 01:55:01,160
- Move him out!
- Please take him out respectfully.

1968
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:02,828
Someone get us some snacks.

1969
01:55:02,897 --> 01:55:04,058
- Yes, take him out.
- Laachi!

1970
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:05,789
He said respectfully.

1971
01:55:05,833 --> 01:55:08,666
- We are being respectful.
- Otherwise, we would have thrashed you.

1972
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:09,767
Okay. Action!

1973
01:55:09,803 --> 01:55:11,032
- Let's go!
- Laachi!

1974
01:55:27,721 --> 01:55:33,888
"You walked all over me,
without a backward glance."

1975
01:55:33,961 --> 01:55:39,832
"You treated me just
like grass under your feet."

1976
01:55:40,066 --> 01:55:46,233
"My sighs question me.."

1977
01:55:46,306 --> 01:55:52,268
"Where do these beautiful
paths disappear to?"

1978
01:55:52,546 --> 01:55:58,747
"You walked all over me,
without a backward glance."

1979
01:55:58,819 --> 01:56:04,656
"You treated me just
like grass under your feet."

1980
01:56:04,858 --> 01:56:10,991
"My sighs question me.."

1981
01:56:11,064 --> 01:56:17,834
"Where do these beautiful
paths disappear to?"

1982
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:36,046
"l kept clearing
obstacles from your path."

1983
01:56:36,123 --> 01:56:42,187
"
 kept worshiping you."

1984
01:56:42,262 --> 01:56:48,258
"l kept clearing
obstacles from your path."

1985
01:56:48,635 --> 01:56:54,130
"
 kept worshiping you."

1986
01:56:54,174 --> 01:57:00,170
"You still sometimes
come in my dreams."

1987
01:57:00,247 --> 01:57:06,277
"In the morning I feel
your presence as heartache."

1988
01:57:06,353 --> 01:57:12,053
"My sighs question me.."

1989
01:57:12,693 --> 01:57:19,121
"Where do these beautiful
paths disappear to?"

1990
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:52,160
I have told mother so
many times to install a door..

1991
01:57:52,666 --> 01:57:54,430
Those who visit the house will find out

1992
01:57:59,873 --> 01:58:01,841
You didn't sleep?

1993
01:58:03,944 --> 01:58:05,309
Sit down.

1994
01:58:11,218 --> 01:58:12,379
You are drunk?

1995
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:19,749
If I knew you would like to come
I bring snacks for you

1996
01:58:22,395 --> 01:58:23,692
Sit.

1997
01:58:24,031 --> 01:58:25,055
l".-

1998
01:58:44,985 --> 01:58:46,009
Let me..

1999
01:58:49,156 --> 01:58:50,180
you are a guest

2000
01:58:56,396 --> 01:58:57,921
What is wrong with you?

2001
01:58:58,732 --> 01:59:00,427
What are you saying?

2002
01:59:02,035 --> 01:59:02,934
Has come to work

2003
01:59:04,171 --> 01:59:05,400
To go to the shooting again in the morning

2004
01:59:06,273 --> 01:59:07,331
Have to work

2005
01:59:09,843 --> 01:59:11,072
I am not going anywhere.

2006
01:59:12,179 --> 01:59:13,738
I don't want to work anymore.

2007
01:59:16,182 --> 01:59:17,445
Don't leave work.

2008
01:59:18,852 --> 01:59:21,116
Leave me.
It is easier.

2009
01:59:28,862 --> 01:59:30,489
I will convince mother.

2010
01:59:31,498 --> 01:59:37,870
that can't be handled

2011
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:40,400
Likewise you have not been handled

2012
02:00:01,294 --> 02:00:04,161
Dear..
You are leaving without meeting me?

2013
02:00:04,231 --> 02:00:07,064
Here I have made Pinnis for you.
Take them with you.

2014
02:00:07,567 --> 02:00:12,198
Share them with your colleagues.
Here you go.

2015
02:00:15,876 --> 02:00:20,871
Dear, during elections we
will sponsor a sport on your behalf.

2016
02:00:21,114 --> 02:00:24,550
Then see how people will vote for me.

2017
02:00:26,887 --> 02:00:28,878
Where are you going?

2018
02:00:28,955 --> 02:00:31,947
The buffalo won't leave
you won't feed her once.

2019
02:00:32,192 --> 02:00:34,251
She is leaving.
Meet her.

2020
02:00:35,429 --> 02:00:36,487
Yes, Mother

2021
02:00:38,532 --> 02:00:39,590
I already did.

2022
02:00:42,969 --> 02:00:43,993
Bye, dear.

2023
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:45,362
Bye, mother.

2024
02:01:12,632 --> 02:01:13,929
Vomiting?

2025
02:01:14,134 --> 02:01:16,432
Did you too get drunk
with Mehnga last night?

2026
02:01:17,304 --> 02:01:18,965
She ate..

2027
02:01:20,907 --> 02:01:24,002
Mehnga, you are going to be a father.

2028
02:01:24,244 --> 02:01:26,144
And I am going to be a grandma.

2029
02:01:26,213 --> 02:01:29,205
Come here, it's time to celebrate.

2030
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:44,995
Take these Pinnis and distribute them.

2031
02:01:45,065 --> 02:01:46,362
- Okay.
- You too have some.

2032
02:01:46,533 --> 02:01:50,299
- And tell them there we are
expecting good news. - Okay.

2033
02:01:50,437 --> 02:01:51,905
Go, son.

2034
02:01:52,339 --> 02:01:53,500
0K8‘!-

2035
02:01:55,575 --> 02:01:58,374
Son, I'll go and get the
sweets from the confectionery.

2036
02:02:23,203 --> 02:02:26,298
Maybe mother is mistaken?

2037
02:02:27,474 --> 02:02:30,569
Or it must be because of
the food you cooked last night?

2038
02:02:36,482 --> 02:02:38,678
Here dear, I distribute
sweets in the village too.

2039
02:02:38,952 --> 02:02:41,284
I have got something sour for you too.
It's very sweet.

2040
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:42,719
Here's tamarind for you.

2041
02:02:46,459 --> 02:02:48,723
Maybe it was because
of some wrong food she had.

2042
02:02:48,995 --> 02:02:50,656
You should be happy.

2043
02:02:51,131 --> 02:02:53,532
You are always getting
drunk with your friends.

2044
02:02:53,733 --> 02:02:55,132
Why should I be happy?

2045
02:02:55,502 --> 02:02:58,597
You didn't let her go for shooting.
She's a working woman.

2046
02:02:58,672 --> 02:03:01,266
Khalsa belongs to Lord.
Victory belongs to Lord.‘

2047
02:03:01,341 --> 02:03:05,244
Mrs. Tej Kaur is
expecting good news.‘

2048
02:03:05,312 --> 02:03:08,179
So, she has donated
500 rupees to the Gurudwara.‘

2049
02:03:08,248 --> 02:03:12,116
The whole village congratulates
her on becoming a grandma.‘

2050
02:03:19,325 --> 02:03:21,623
Mother has lost her mind.
She is thinking too much into it.

2051
02:03:32,406 --> 02:03:34,204
Brother,
do you have an infant at home..

2052
02:03:34,274 --> 02:03:35,571
..or a child who is
less than 5 years old?

2053
02:03:35,642 --> 02:03:36,666
We are here to administer polio drops.

2054
02:03:36,743 --> 02:03:38,211
No, we don't have
any child living here.

2055
02:03:38,611 --> 02:03:40,670
You keep looking
for kids in the house.

2056
02:03:40,713 --> 02:03:42,477
..how about giving polio
meds to the ones on the streets?

2057
02:03:42,549 --> 02:03:43,710
He is irked.

2058
02:03:59,532 --> 02:04:02,126
- Hello?
- Congratulations.

2059
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:10,304
To you too.

2060
02:04:10,643 --> 02:04:13,374
Everyone is celebrating here.

2061
02:04:13,546 --> 02:04:16,038
Everyone is very happy.
They are dancing outside.

2062
02:04:16,283 --> 02:04:17,307
And what about you?

2063
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:19,240
I am bound to be happy.

2064
02:04:19,753 --> 02:04:20,777
What about you?

2065
02:04:23,657 --> 02:04:25,056
I too am very happy.

2066
02:04:26,726 --> 02:04:29,661
I don't know how to handle this.

2067
02:04:30,764 --> 02:04:33,165
Child is important and so is the work.

2068
02:04:34,834 --> 02:04:36,495
Do as you feel fit.

2069
02:04:37,403 --> 02:04:38,427
I am with you.

2070
02:04:39,539 --> 02:04:42,372
I knew that you'd understand me.

2071
02:04:43,643 --> 02:04:45,577
Don't worry, I handle it.

2072
02:04:46,546 --> 02:04:47,604
0K8‘!-

2073
02:04:59,493 --> 02:05:01,518
Come here.
Come close to me.

2074
02:05:02,729 --> 02:05:03,821
Look at that.

2075
02:05:11,204 --> 02:05:12,228
Look at her.

2076
02:05:16,209 --> 02:05:18,109
Laachi.. boo!

2077
02:05:19,645 --> 02:05:21,340
You are eating tamarind stealthily?

2078
02:05:23,249 --> 02:05:26,879
I knew that I am right.
That's why I took good care of her.

2079
02:05:28,755 --> 02:05:30,450
You are going to be a father.

2080
02:05:32,359 --> 02:05:33,588
Right, Laachi?

2081
02:05:34,528 --> 02:05:35,689
Yes.

2082
02:06:13,266 --> 02:06:14,233
The tea is almost ready.

2083
02:06:14,901 --> 02:06:16,164
What is wrong?

2084
02:06:18,304 --> 02:06:19,465
What is wrong?

2085
02:06:20,907 --> 02:06:23,205
What do you want?
I will get it out for you.

2086
02:06:24,511 --> 02:06:25,672
What are you looking for?

2087
02:06:29,482 --> 02:06:30,677
Your family blanket.

2088
02:06:32,185 --> 02:06:33,482
We won't this now.

2089
02:06:33,953 --> 02:06:36,547
We will give it to our daughter.

2090
02:06:36,956 --> 02:06:37,923
That's it.

2091
02:06:38,257 --> 02:06:39,622
Don't fool me anymore.

2092
02:06:40,359 --> 02:06:42,418
Not our daughter, your daughter.

2093
02:06:44,464 --> 02:06:47,695
"Child is important
and so is the work."

2094
02:06:48,701 --> 02:06:50,726
I know whom you were
having the discussion with.

2095
02:06:51,504 --> 02:06:53,268
He is from an affluent family.

2096
02:06:53,473 --> 02:06:54,907
You both are in the same line of work.

2097
02:06:55,475 --> 02:06:56,442
Canada?

2098
02:06:58,811 --> 02:07:00,643
And I kept waiting for you over here.

2099
02:07:02,482 --> 02:07:03,847
And you never came back.

2100
02:07:10,624 --> 02:07:12,786
- You are mistaken.
- Enough!

2101
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:15,828
Enough of your drama.

2102
02:07:15,995 --> 02:07:17,463
I won't be able to tolerate it.

2103
02:07:18,264 --> 02:07:20,756
Your cheap happiness is
proving to be very dear to me.

2104
02:07:23,003 --> 02:07:26,439
Go back to your parents' house!

2105
02:07:26,906 --> 02:07:28,305
I am done with you!

2106
02:07:28,408 --> 02:07:29,534
Listen to me. 
..

2107
02:07:30,009 --> 02:07:30,908
Go!

2108
02:07:30,977 --> 02:07:33,241
" No!
<i>_</i> G0 away!

2109
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:44,253
"There are still so many
left incomplete, unsaid..."

2110
02:07:44,324 --> 02:07:50,286
"Why can't I forget
the things you said...?"

2111
02:07:50,463 --> 02:07:56,527
"Why can't I forget
the things you said...?"

2112
02:07:56,669 --> 02:08:03,041
"There are still so many
left incomplete, unsaid..."

2113
02:08:03,776 --> 02:08:07,906
Mehnga!
See, what's wrong with her!

2114
02:08:12,585 --> 02:08:14,679
Say something, dear.

2115
02:08:17,757 --> 02:08:19,953
What is wrong with her?

2116
02:08:37,344 --> 02:08:38,971
- ls my daughter fine?
- Yes, she is fine.

2117
02:08:39,312 --> 02:08:40,837
There is nothing to worry about.

2118
02:08:40,913 --> 02:08:42,608
- And her child?
- Child?

2119
02:08:42,749 --> 02:08:44,376
- She is pregnant, right?
- No, she isn't.

2120
02:08:44,417 --> 02:08:45,782
She kept saying that she wants to go.

2121
02:09:09,942 --> 02:09:11,603
I didn't like it.

2122
02:09:13,513 --> 02:09:15,845
..when they dragged you outside.

2123
02:09:17,583 --> 02:09:18,414
You know..

2124
02:09:21,087 --> 02:09:23,715
My mind was in the village
even before you went back.

2125
02:09:26,826 --> 02:09:27,554
But.

2126
02:09:29,829 --> 02:09:33,356
They are big, affluent people.
I couldn't just refuse to work.

2127
02:09:37,837 --> 02:09:39,931
When I decided I
couldn't take it anymore.

2128
02:09:43,543 --> 02:09:44,840
I came back to you.

2129
02:09:46,112 --> 02:09:48,444
And you asked me to go back.

2130
02:09:49,449 --> 02:09:51,577
I thought I'd make an excuse.

2131
02:09:53,586 --> 02:09:55,816
If I'd make an excuse of a headache.

2132
02:09:56,455 --> 02:09:58,389
"then I could only stay
here for two days at the most.

2133
02:10:04,464 --> 02:10:06,159
I gave it a lot of
thought over this act.

2134
02:10:10,503 --> 02:10:12,699
Even law can't interfere
when it comes to this.

2135
02:10:15,141 --> 02:10:20,170
I was very angry when you doubted me.

2136
02:10:20,813 --> 02:10:22,508
And our daughter's blanket.

2137
02:10:45,171 --> 02:10:46,434
Forgive me.

2138
02:10:47,607 --> 02:10:48,665
I misunderstood you.

2139
02:10:49,909 --> 02:10:51,104
Forgive me as well.

2140
02:10:51,811 --> 02:10:53,677
I was so lost in my acting.

2141
02:10:54,747 --> 02:10:56,613
Your acting will
get us killed one day.

2142
02:10:57,984 --> 02:10:59,850
No more acting inside
the house, got it?

2143
02:11:01,854 --> 02:11:04,687
Henceforth,
you can only act outside the house.

2144
02:11:10,663 --> 02:11:12,859
You have made me
fall in love with you.

2145
02:11:14,767 --> 02:11:16,201
Stop with the acting, I am..

2146
02:11:16,536 --> 02:11:17,230
Love?

2147
02:11:24,009 --> 02:11:25,704
You fall in love with me.

2148
02:11:30,717 --> 02:11:32,151
Let her go, bro.

2149
02:11:34,186 --> 02:11:35,711
Do it at home.

2150
02:11:36,889 --> 02:11:37,651
Yes.

2151
02:11:48,101 --> 02:11:49,569
So, shall we begin?

2152
02:11:50,903 --> 02:11:51,927
I won't say it.

2153
02:11:52,705 --> 02:11:54,571
It's just one dialogue.
Please say it.

2154
02:11:54,907 --> 02:11:56,568
It would wrap up the movie.

2155
02:11:56,676 --> 02:11:58,235
We have brought all
the equipments here.

2156
02:11:58,678 --> 02:12:00,612
We know that you are not well.

2157
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:02,976
But it's just one dialogue.
Please you could please do it?

2158
02:12:03,583 --> 02:12:04,778
Bro, please tell her to do it.

2159
02:12:06,685 --> 02:12:08,153
She is unwell, but.

2160
02:12:08,988 --> 02:12:10,820
She can say one dialogue.

2161
02:12:10,956 --> 02:12:12,549
These poor people will
be able to wrap up their movie.

2162
02:12:13,726 --> 02:12:14,249
Fine.

2163
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:18,728
But first,
you respectfully take Ajaypal outside.

2164
02:12:23,970 --> 02:12:25,734
It takes two people to do that.

2165
02:12:26,739 --> 02:12:27,934
Fine, then push him.

2166
02:12:28,207 --> 02:12:28,935
Push him?

2167
02:12:32,545 --> 02:12:34,172
Her condition is such
that she can say anything.

2168
02:12:40,152 --> 02:12:42,246
He is a nice man, why.. Laachi?

2169
02:12:42,621 --> 02:12:43,747
And he has his guards with him.

2170
02:12:43,822 --> 02:12:45,620
Okay tell me, what's the dialogue?

2171
02:12:45,758 --> 02:12:47,317
I am pregnant with your child.

2172
02:12:50,663 --> 02:12:52,324
Can't it be anything else?
"
 am going to be an aunt?"

2173
02:12:52,598 --> 02:12:53,997
"
 am going to be an auntie?"

2174
02:12:54,734 --> 02:12:55,633
Please?

2175
02:12:57,069 --> 02:12:58,230
It's just one dialogue.

2176
02:12:59,205 --> 02:13:00,070
Say it.

2177
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:02,267
I am pregnant with your child.

2178
02:13:02,708 --> 02:13:04,267
Drop the attitude.

2179
02:13:04,644 --> 02:13:06,772
You are not the father,
you are the mother.

2180
02:13:06,879 --> 02:13:09,007
- Try to understand the scene..
- Her condition is such..

2181
02:13:13,352 --> 02:13:15,116
I am pregnant with your child.

2182
02:13:15,288 --> 02:13:17,154
There, I knew it..

2183
02:13:17,289 --> 02:13:20,816
That she is pregnant.
The doctor lied.

2184
02:13:20,893 --> 02:13:23,362
She isn't pregnant with my child.
She is pregnant in her movie.

2185
02:13:23,629 --> 02:13:24,187
What?

2186
02:13:29,769 --> 02:13:31,066
She isn't pregnant with your child?

2187
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:34,037
No, she is pregnant with my child.

2188
02:13:34,673 --> 02:13:36,141
She is pregnant in her movie too.

2189
02:13:36,209 --> 02:13:36,903
Movie?

2190
02:13:36,976 --> 02:13:38,603
She is pregnant everywhere, right?

2191
02:13:41,213 --> 02:13:43,875
Bro, this reason calls for it.

2192
02:13:44,083 --> 02:13:46,984
I have a fresh song.
I'll sing it if you want me to.

2193
02:13:47,320 --> 02:13:48,651
Go ahead.

2194
02:13:50,222 --> 02:13:53,317
"People take care of their girl.."

2195
02:13:55,261 --> 02:13:58,026
"
 value my moustache more."

2196
02:14:00,233 --> 02:14:01,291
Anyway. .

2197
02:14:01,834 --> 02:14:04,269
It's been so long,
we haven't taken a selfie.

2198
02:14:06,372 --> 02:14:08,204
You are great, touch yours.

2199
02:14:10,376 --> 02:14:11,207
Do this.

2200
02:14:12,778 --> 02:14:13,404
Status?

2201
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:14,237
Like this.

2202
02:14:15,214 --> 02:14:17,410
"Go and drown yourself, you wretches!"

2203
02:14:17,750 --> 02:14:19,684
"You are not destined to be with us."

2204
02:14:20,186 --> 02:14:24,054
"Send someone who
understands our sorrows."

2205
02:14:25,991 --> 02:14:28,289
The story should be good.
Money is not a problem.

2206
02:14:28,361 --> 02:14:29,920
We can earn money
by singing and dancing.

2207
02:14:30,062 --> 02:14:32,656
Yes, and we want a good director.
Someone like Sanjay, Singh, Bansa
i..

2208
02:14:32,798 --> 02:14:34,789
Yes, someone like them.

2209
02:14:34,967 --> 02:14:36,093
Ma'am, is the costume okay?

2210
02:14:37,002 --> 02:14:38,128
Don't you think it's a little dirty?

2211
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:39,999
No actually,
ma'am, it's for the riots scene.

2212
02:14:40,172 --> 02:14:42,197
- Really? Then it's fine.
- Yes, ma'am.

2213
02:14:43,242 --> 02:14:45,176
- You are shooting the riots scene today?
- Yes, sir.

2214
02:14:45,978 --> 02:14:46,911
Can I say something?

2215
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:51,209
I wish we were born when
there was just one Punjab.

2216
02:14:51,717 --> 02:14:54,118
You wouldn't need a visa
to go to Punjab from Lahore.

2217
02:14:54,286 --> 02:14:56,015
All you needed was an excuse.

2218
02:14:56,689 --> 02:14:59,454
We would have belonged
to different religions.

2219
02:14:59,992 --> 02:15:02,359
Then we would fall in love.

2220
02:15:02,728 --> 02:15:05,288
Enough. I am tired of
pretending to be in love.

2221
02:15:05,464 --> 02:15:08,297
Next, you will ask me to be a can.
I won't do it.

2222
02:15:08,367 --> 02:15:10,893
No, we will act for long in it.

2223
02:15:11,437 --> 02:15:12,905
- When we fall in love..
- Yes.

2224
02:15:13,005 --> 02:15:14,234
It's 1947.

2225
02:15:14,473 --> 02:15:16,339
Riots take place and you get murdered.

2226
02:15:16,942 --> 02:15:19,172
Then I marry someone
from my own religion.

2227
02:15:19,345 --> 02:15:20,005
Greetings.

2228
02:15:24,917 --> 02:15:28,478
Oh, I forgot. I get murdered as well.

2229
02:15:29,221 --> 02:15:30,916
My uncles would kill you.

2230
02:15:31,190 --> 02:15:33,386
She wants to get married
after getting our boy murdered.

2231
02:15:39,131 --> 02:15:40,496
Which religion would I belong to?

2232
02:15:41,267 --> 02:15:44,237
"l saw an angel as white as milk."

2233
02:15:44,303 --> 02:15:47,432
"She changed my life completely."

2234
02:15:49,475 --> 02:15:52,467
"
 was carrying a
radio on my shoulder."

2235
02:15:52,745 --> 02:15:55,305
"She winked and called
out to me stealthily."

2236
02:15:55,414 --> 02:15:57,940
"
 was carrying a
radio on my shoulder."

2237
02:15:58,017 --> 02:16:01,146
"She winked and called
out to me stealthily."

2238
02:16:01,220 --> 02:16:05,885
"Impossible."

2239
02:16:06,125 --> 02:16:09,823
"You have been trying for so long..
You are so dense."

2240
02:16:09,996 --> 02:16:12,363
"Where are you from?"

2241
02:16:12,531 --> 02:16:16,764
"Where have you come from?
Where's your village and family?"

2242
02:16:16,903 --> 02:16:21,807
"Where have you come from?
Where's your village and family?"

2243
02:16:33,853 --> 02:16:39,087
"
 spend the entire day thinking
about the moment I met her."

2244
02:16:39,158 --> 02:16:42,059
"Her bangles are delicate,
my bracelet is heavy.."

2245
02:16:42,127 --> 02:16:44,528
"She filled my hear-t with happiness."

2246
02:16:44,797 --> 02:16:46,287
"
 was upset with the world."

2247
02:16:46,365 --> 02:16:51,201
"And she made me forget
everything in no time."

2248
02:16:53,105 --> 02:16:55,904
"
 was carrying a
radio on my shoulder."

2249
02:16:55,975 --> 02:16:58,910
"She winked and called
out to me stealthily."

2250
02:16:58,978 --> 02:17:01,379
"
 was carrying a
radio on my shoulder."

2251
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:04,848
"She winked and called
out to me stealthily."

2252
02:17:05,117 --> 02:17:07,484
"You are like cheap liquor.."

2253
02:17:07,886 --> 02:17:10,321
"You are like cheap liquor.."

2254
02:17:10,523 --> 02:17:13,151
"You taste bitten."

2255
02:17:13,358 --> 02:17:15,156
"You taste bitten."

2256
02:17:15,227 --> 02:17:17,286
"You make me go crazy."

2257
02:17:17,363 --> 02:17:22,597
"Why do you step into my
hear-t without my permission?"

2258
02:17:34,413 --> 02:17:37,280
"
 feel like I am dead
when I hear her voice.."

2259
02:17:37,349 --> 02:17:39,943
"
 feel like I am dead
when I hear her voice.."

2260
02:17:40,019 --> 02:17:42,852
"
 jump with joy,
like I have hit a jackpot."

2261
02:17:42,921 --> 02:17:45,856
"
 can feel the love in the air."

2262
02:17:45,925 --> 02:17:48,519
"There is a reason why she
plaits her hair as she does.."

2263
02:17:48,594 --> 02:17:53,031
"She sways it to distribute her love."

2264
02:17:53,866 --> 02:17:56,563
"
 was carrying a
radio on my shoulder."

2265
02:17:56,635 --> 02:17:59,502
"She winked and called
out to me stealthily."
