1
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,167
Gurgaon.

2
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,300
...my father's village.

3
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,736
My city.

4
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,237
Where I learned the business
of collection, in school.

5
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,438
The school head-boy and house-captain
were to be selected for next year.

6
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,145
I had to become either one.

7
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,523
Every year, there were
such collections in our school,

8
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,314
on Independence Day, on teacher's day,

9
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,892
even on the Principal's birthday.

10
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,058
Ten rupees per kid.

11
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,024
And kids used to bring it from home.

12
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,395
The students who could
make these collections happen

13
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,799
were selected as the
head boy or the house captain.

14
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,769
That year, the Principal
chose our class for the collections.

15
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,932
Ten rupees per student,
from nursery to class tenth.

16
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,239
However, a few tenth class students

17
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,405
were always adamant
about not paying up.

18
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,943
And that year some adamant
guys were beaten up by me.

19
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,820
In retaliation those students
got goons to beat me up.

20
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,116
But those goons also
got beaten up.

21
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,082
Police came to our school.

22
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,416
I had to apologise to the Principal.

23
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,589
But when the house-captain
post was announced,

24
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,861
'Arya Phogat' was
written on the badge.

25
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,693
My name.

26
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,269
Blood and sweat flow downwards

27
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,674
but money flows upwards,

28
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,907
and if the guy sitting down
can make it flow to the people on top,

29
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,147
they say that guy is 'diligent'.

30
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,092
'DCP Ravikant Phogat.'

31
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,690
My uncle.

32
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,298
He and his wife Rama
have brought me up,

33
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,098
along with their son
Dev and daughter Trishla.

34
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,140
Namaste uncle.

35
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,800
How are you?

36
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,609
Namaste Uncle.
- Bless you.

37
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,236
Listen, the kids are here.

38
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,042
How are you?
- Good..

39
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,051
Sister-in-law.
- Trishla.

40
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,951
Gently, the sweets will crumble.

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,683
Keep it inside?
- Here... yes.

42
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,151
Respect, sister-in-law.
- Bless you.

43
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,454
Everyone's here.

44
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,687
<i>Namaste, Aunty.</i>

45
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,690
Be happy-

46
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,423
OK, start tying the threads everyone.

47
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,364
Sit down.
I'll wash my hands and be back.

48
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,430
On the outside we look
like a normal police family.

49
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,469
But we are true businessmen.

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,338
We are in the business of collection!

51
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,852
Look this way...
smile everyone... good.

52
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,883
Hide it from Vishnu
and give it to Trishla.

53
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,956
You are giving Trishla
the money again on the sly.

54
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,199
Your sister has chosen
an honest policeman,

55
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,535
who sees colour in money.

56
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,372
Black or white!

57
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,607
Tell Vishnu about your brother Vijay.

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,840
He will realize that even
the dogs don't care about the honest.

59
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,580
Vishnu. My uncle's son-in-law.

60
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,917
Uncle has kept him far away
from the collection business.

61
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,185
Vishnu is honest.

62
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,226
I worry for him.

63
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,397
I hope he doesn't
end up like my father.

64
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,282
Carry on. I am coming.

65
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,423
Ok.

66
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:16,655
I built a home to live away
from the city for a quiet life.

67
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,390
Now this expanding city
has crawled upon our home.

68
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:25,062
The city where you achieved nothing,
made nothing,

69
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,569
won't even appeal
to you from a distance.

70
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,105
You did it all, didn't you?

71
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,411
Arya.

72
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:48,158
This is all the conversation
we have had, in all these years.

73
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,717
Policemen often get
into wrong encounters.

74
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,325
Innocent people get killed sometimes.

75
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,161
You made one mistake and,
and you stopped looking at me.

76
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,704
Your conversation used to be
'eaten?' 'School?'

77
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,100
Can I speak openly today?

78
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,509
Up to you.

79
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,449
I never mentioned this to you

80
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,256
because I did not want
you to get into any trouble.

81
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:25,384
Two lives were at risk.

82
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:31,530
The two people who depend on me,
who are my responsibility.

83
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,465
Which two people?

84
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,265
A woman and a boy.

85
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,212
Your woman?

86
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,887
Your son?

87
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,684
Yes.

88
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:00,963
Bloody...

89
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,098
Were you so lonely after mother died?

90
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,069
We fell in love with each other.

91
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,983
You'll learn a lot more
when you see them.

92
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,950
I don't want to see them.

93
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,453
Just the address would suffice.

94
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,584
You want me to send the money, right?

95
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,129
I'll keep sending it regularly.

96
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,760
Inform them when I pass away.

97
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,932
They live in Nainital.

98
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,066
Don't mention this to
your uncle Ravi or anyone else.

99
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:52,042
Once I am gone they
are your responsibility.

100
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,283
Your family.

101
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,479
Veera Phogat?

102
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,411
That's me.

103
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,081
I am Arya.

104
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,506
Mum, I am going...

105
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:35,281
Mum, what happened?

106
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,648
Your father.

107
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,062
Arya brought the news.

108
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,393
Arya?

109
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,412
Papa used to talk a lot about you.

110
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:13,248
He never mentioned you two until
only a few days before his death.

111
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,417
Yeah.

112
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,821
He was afraid of telling you.

113
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:24,564
He knew you wouldn't
accept my mother and me.

114
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,539
Could you not forgive him
after you heard the entire story?

115
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,007
Arya...

116
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,015
Arya...

117
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,399
Uncle.

118
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,598
I can't believe this.

119
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,176
Believe what?

120
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,546
Twenty-five years ago,

121
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,575
my brother Vijaykant was
thrown out of the police force,

122
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,146
because he accidentally
killed a criminal's wife

123
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,954
and their three-year-old son.

124
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,491
But today that woman and
that son are in front of me.

125
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,290
What are you saying?

126
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,893
Am I not making sense to you?

127
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,663
I don't know anything.

128
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,634
Not even 'Yashwardhan Singh?'

129
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,304
Who is Yashwardhan Singh?

130
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,744
Vishal, go inside.

131
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,449
You two also please leave.

132
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,411
I don't want to answer your questions.

133
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,623
Doesn't matter.
We will keep asking the questions.

134
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,993
I don't know any Yashwardhan Singh.

135
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,123
Who is Yashwardhan?

136
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,096
Your real father.

137
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,461
You have a brother too. Twin brother.

138
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,587
This...

139
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,330
What's all this, mother?

140
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,207
Say something, mum.

141
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:56,681
Yashwardhan Singh was
once the biggest gangster

142
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,279
in the three states
of Delhi-UP-Haryana.

143
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:06,786
I didn't know anything
about him when we got married.

144
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,961
And when I came to know

145
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,399
I'd already had twin babies.

146
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,031
Ajay

147
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,639
and Vishal.

148
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:29,709
Inspector Vijaykant was collecting
evidence against Yashwardhan.

149
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,949
I wanted to get out of
that marriage and that life.

150
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,455
So I became Vijaykant's informer.

151
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,569
All the people that met Yashwardhan...
the time he left home...

152
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,363
I kept informing...

153
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,870
this kept going on... time moved on,

154
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:03,544
but evidence was never gathered.
Case was never made.

155
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,891
Just like your encounter
never actually happened.

156
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,518
The case was never made.

157
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:18,894
But I and Vijay fell in love.

158
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,032
Then why bring just one of the twins?

159
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,082
Whatever I had to tell my son,
I have told.

160
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,518
If you want more information,

161
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,452
then bring a warrant, arrest me!

162
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,283
Or else, please leave.

163
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,090
I didn't understand one thing...

164
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,789
My father was thrown out
of the police because of you two.

165
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,199
He got humiliated in
the press and his department.

166
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,964
But he kept his silence.

167
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,973
He could have risen through
the ranks in his department.

168
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:04,772
He always believed that your
own kin matters more than your dreams.

169
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,507
Oh really?

170
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,951
I've always felt
that he never valued me.

171
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,659
But I know now that he
never thought of me as his own.

172
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,258
My brother was never able
to make his case against Yashwardhan.

173
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:24,290
Today that man operates
illegal businesses

174
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,434
in the garb of a real estate empire.

175
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,673
Police had no evidence against
him then, and has none until now.

176
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,244
Even now Yashwardhan could be arrested

177
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,574
and you two brought
in front of the world.

178
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:41,380
Then yes,
my brother's name can be redeemed.

179
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,081
But how can Yashwardhan
go to jail now?

180
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,626
Ever heard of 'Aurangzeb?'

181
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,592
The Mughal Emperor?

182
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,926
What if there was an 'Aurangzeb'
in Yashwardhan's gang,

183
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:01,998
the one who would capture the
king and kill the rest for the throne?

184
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,838
You mean Ajay?

185
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,986
Ajay's brother Vishal in his place.

186
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,568
When the land starts
getting sold in the villages,

187
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,304
the filth of the countryside
starts coming to the city.

188
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,938
You guys too have become
rich by selling your farmland.

189
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,313
You've earned money but not class.

190
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,753
Untie our driver. Bastard.

191
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,353
Of course I'll set this poor guy free,

192
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,464
but what I'll do to you...
have you thought of that?

193
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,158
I'll blow a window in your head.

194
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,899
The wind will blow through
and keep you cool.

195
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,406
My father says I am a thick-head.

196
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:16,810
Shoot, let's check if the
bullet goes through or bounces back.

197
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,438
Shoot... shoot... shoot.

198
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,949
You dog.

199
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,662
This property-dealer works for us.

200
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,767
He's the one we sent to take
your signature and thumb impressions.

201
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,701
And this is what you did to him?

202
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,675
He was forcibly making
us sign the papers.

203
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,268
And was quoting a very low price.

204
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,313
But he was saying our name, right?

205
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,578
Then how did you dare
sign for another colonizer?

206
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,643
Speak.

207
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,983
Listen, listen... someone called

208
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,284
to say that Yashwardhan
Singh wants to withdraw his claim.

209
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,222
Don't lie.

210
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,657
Never, brother.
- Don't lie!

211
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,319
I am not lying.

212
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,567
He's telling the truth.

213
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,930
Yashwardhan has cancelled the deal

214
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,609
He's called you for a meeting.

215
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,454
What the hell were you up to?

216
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,631
Some plots were
included in the R-zone.

217
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,263
I wanted to do the deal.

218
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,829
I've told you a million times to
let Nina handle the high level jobs.

219
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,837
So then why didn't
Nina herself find out

220
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,434
about the R-zone land before I could?

221
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,580
A politician was
interested in that land,

222
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,207
and we were interested
in a relationship with him.

223
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,080
That's why we backed
out from the deal.

224
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,220
You do have a lot of relationships,
hun... Ms. Nina.

225
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,879
Ajay!

226
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,888
Get a grip on your tongue and fists.

227
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,725
Sit at lnder's club
and learn the job.

228
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,196
Or else, go to hell.

229
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,132
Sit at the club and do what?

230
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,633
Look after the bouncers...

231
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,467
...or manage those girls who
charge ten thousand for a stag entry,

232
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,562
...thirty thousand for a dance...

233
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,142
...and one hundred
thousand to go to bed? Huh?

234
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,738
Those girls work for us.

235
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,178
Managing them is also part of our job.

236
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,140
I have no interest
in managing your sorts!

237
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,516
Apologise... apologise.

238
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,557
Apologise... apologise.

239
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,824
Don't exert yourself
too much in your old age.

240
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,600
Just like your chairs,
your bones are also delicate.

241
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,062
Apologise.

242
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,400
Why just an apology?

243
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,771
I can start calling
her 'mother' if you want.

244
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,314
By making her your business partner...

245
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,382
...your staff, politicians,
businessmen might respect her.

246
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,930
Not me.

247
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:18,715
Relax. Stress is not good for you.

248
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,386
Don't come out. I am diving in.

249
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,486
I'm not in the mood.

250
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,657
My head is messed up already,
so don't throw tantrums.

251
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,262
And if I do, will you hit me again?

252
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,242
Looks like you have
met your match outside.

253
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,603
Otherwise you just
keep abusing me here.

254
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,873
Hold on, hold on.

255
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,707
Take the robe off and then talk.

256
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,884
My ears are closed,
only my eyes are open.

257
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,390
Fine. Then keep your ears shut.

258
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,865
You like raising your hands on others?

259
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:37,691
Why?

260
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:43,364
Were you beaten up a lot as
a child by bullies in your school?

261
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,965
Or at home by uncle?

262
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:51,077
What weakness are you hiding
behind this anger... this violence?

263
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,910
You want a sample of it,
here or upstairs?

264
00:22:56,308 --> 00:23:00,586
You try so hard to look like
a powerful king like your father,

265
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,420
by beating and abusing people.

266
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,358
But people are not
scared of your violence,

267
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,123
they are scared of
Yashwardhan Singh's name.

268
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,093
Did you get scared now? Did you?

269
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,005
If you're so fed up
then why don't you leave me?

270
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,670
Because I love you.
You're the vice that I can't quit.

271
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,075
Are you telling the truth?

272
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,609
What does it look like?

273
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,175
A lie.

274
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,888
N ow?

275
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,287
Lie.

276
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,823
And now?

277
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,527
Lie.
- Never mind.

278
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,363
You enjoy the lies
more than the truth.

279
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,625
Car keys.

280
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,221
Wallet.

281
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,631
Ajay's mobile-phone.

282
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,231
This is the other phone.

283
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,430
Contact us through this.

284
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,206
Not from Ajay's phone.

285
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:38,414
And behave strangely for a few days.

286
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:40,849
Strangely?

287
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:45,855
Yes... lost... say you
were mugged on the highway.

288
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,152
Beaten up and mugged.

289
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,739
Vijay and I didn't bring
you out of there to send you back.

290
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,002
I know.

291
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,874
Even papa would have
not let me go back there.

292
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,774
And you're doing the same.

293
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,580
But if I don't go now...

294
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,744
...the stain of our murder...

295
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,413
...will always remain on papa's name.

296
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,132
Ajay.

297
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,803
Ajay!

298
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,181
What've you done?

299
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,917
Me... I...

300
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,590
You've been in some fight again?

301
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:16,070
Some guys beat me up and...

302
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,563
Did you kill someone? Speak up?

303
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:20,703
They hit me.

304
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,134
What?

305
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,742
Robbed me.

306
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,172
Ajay!

307
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:28,907
Ajay!

308
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,823
Who are you bastards?
Just tell me once.

309
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,829
Police. We are Police.

310
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,523
Do you know who I am?

311
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,393
You are you.

312
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:52,937
How could we disrespect the
prince and take him for someone else?

313
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,912
Do you have a warrant?

314
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,380
But this is not a lock-up
either... bad boy of Gurgaon...

315
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,179
Bloody old man!

316
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,322
Listen. We've got you here to talk.

317
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:15,091
If you flap too much,
we'll chop off your wings one by one.

318
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,164
Now answer the questions.

319
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,259
Answer.

320
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,064
We need names.

321
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,206
Yashwardhan has a clean front.

322
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,473
But what are his real businesses?

323
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,978
What's his source of income?

324
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,351
Who are his accomplices?

325
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:44,055
We need the names of people
and the firms from you, kid.

326
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,120
That's it?
- That's it.

327
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:54,263
Pour as much oil as you want...

328
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,573
Pour till the Arabian
oil wells dry up.

329
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,966
Enjoy yourselves till
my father comes to know that...

330
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,068
...you've arrested
me without a warrant.

331
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,844
He won't even know his son is missing.

332
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,387
Yes doctor, thank you.

333
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,088
How did those guys let you go?

334
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,699
Meaning?

335
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:28,531
Meaning, they didn't take
the imported car, or the mobile.

336
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,164
Left the wallet after
taking the money,

337
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,065
where did all this happen?

338
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,639
On Sohna road.

339
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,591
What happened?

340
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,859
He says someone misbehaved.

341
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,300
Take him away.

342
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,735
Sit.

343
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,600
Let me see how much you're hurt.

344
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,814
You're hurt as well?

345
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,243
Huh...

346
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,616
Yes, I suppose so.

347
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,791
I only sent the goons
who beat you up today.

348
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:23,892
Goons?

349
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,217
Yes, to get even with you.

350
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,632
I hit you.

351
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,530
It's ok, you don't need to feel bad.

352
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,074
Lie down.

353
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,532
Yes.

354
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,916
You've hurt your head really bad,
haven't you?

355
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,078
Meaning?

356
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,959
Meaning by now you
would've taken 2-3 guys...

357
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,120
...and gone out looking
for those goons yourself.

358
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,326
Anyway-

359
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,402
l am cancelling my program tonight.

360
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,271
I should be with you.

361
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,913
I've had minor scratches
like this before.

362
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,316
There is no need
to cancel the program.

363
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,484
In fact call the entire gang.

364
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,526
I want to see everyone's
faces together.

365
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,754
Ajay is here.

366
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,858
Good.

367
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,251
I want to kill him.

368
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,996
Excuse me.

369
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,658
Mom, how dare he misbehave with you?

370
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,361
It's a blessing in disguise.

371
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,737
The more he misbehaves...

372
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,076
...the more Yashwardhan will keep
him away from the business.

373
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:26,238
They fly about at night,

374
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:33,216
These dreams have come to life.

375
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:40,455
It's a misty sight,

376
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:48,169
Set them free tonight.

377
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:54,108
Let us burn, lets drown, lets go down.

378
00:33:54,198 --> 00:34:01,241
Destruction, sweet freedom.

379
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:08,382
Destruction, sweet freedom.

380
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:35,673
Come be divine, destroy the line

381
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:42,514
Do the crime, and cut it fine.

382
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:49,360
We're the fire in the eye

383
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:55,701
burning and bright, it's do or die

384
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:02,678
Let us burn, lets drown,
lets go down.

385
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:09,742
Destruction, sweet freedom.

386
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:16,486
Destruction, sweet freedom.

387
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:06,166
Didn't I tell you, no one
will even know you're missing?

388
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,800
Who is this?

389
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,845
Whose face did you change
with plastic surgery?

390
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,077
These are the names of some people...

391
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,617
...we suspect they are
working with your father.

392
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,588
Just say which ones are
correct and which are not.

393
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,097
You will rot here forever...

394
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,537
...while that guy lives your life.

395
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,305
He will call your dad 'Dad'.

396
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:44,338
He will sleep with your girlfriend
till you're silent.

397
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:51,012
The sooner you talk,
the sooner you can leave.

398
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,221
Think about it.

399
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:04,559
And will you believe whatever I say?

400
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,266
Just try it!

401
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,100
Sir, the next time you come...

402
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,170
...just bring a mosquito
repellent along.

403
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,706
Too many mosquitoes here!

404
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,780
They never bite,
just keep buzzing and annoying me.

405
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:58,940
What's this?

406
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:03,749
Ajay's emails, texts,
photographs, mobile phone contacts.

407
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,488
You've gathered this trash?

408
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,085
Ajay is not important.

409
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:16,629
The important one is Yashwardhan
and his business associates.

410
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,430
Yashwardhan is hardly at home

411
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,128
which is why I don't
see him very often.

412
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,731
Besides, Ajay spent most
of his time either with his friends

413
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,106
or with his girlfriend Ritu.

414
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,079
That's why I haven't got
information beyond Ajay's friends.

415
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,346
So...

416
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,119
...you will have to start
going to Yashwardhan's office then.

417
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,917
You will learn about his
business from there.

418
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,787
Why would he take me to his office?

419
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,892
Because you will ask him
to teach you about the business.

420
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,429
Won't he suspect
if I do things so soon?

421
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,591
'Soon?'

422
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,229
You've been living in that
house for twenty-seven years!

423
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,363
We've made this list
from new and old records.

424
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:02,474
These are names of people we suspect
are associated with Yashwardhan.

425
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:08,249
Just keep your ears open,
and don't ask too many questions.

426
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,479
Ok...

427
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,247
How's my mother?

428
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,825
She is fine.

429
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:26,863
We will have to break Ajay
to be able to guide Vishal.

430
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:33,304
Ajay won't break, no matter how
much we hit him or try to scare him.

431
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:39,046
He knows the minute he opens
his mouth, his father will go to jail.

432
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,511
He would be scared of the
fate he will be meted out after that.

433
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,083
I am not talking about
beating or scaring him.

434
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,689
Then?

435
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,992
Ajay loves his father's empire...

436
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,161
...because he believes
he will inherit it one day.

437
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,163
If we shake this belief of Ajay's...

438
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,268
...then he might open up.

439
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,861
Your mother.

440
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,339
My mother is dead.

441
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,755
Oh, so you've put
this fool over there.

442
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:35,126
Your mother left Yashwardhan
because of his bad ways.

443
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,966
Yashwardhan had an
affair with Nina Wadhwa...

444
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:43,202
...and they have a son.

445
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:45,696
Inder.

446
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,777
What did you think?

447
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:54,082
Yashwardhan will leave
the entire empire to you?

448
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,143
No! He will give it to
his other son lnder as well.

449
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,982
Nina will make sure
it's split two ways.

450
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,388
Perhaps a bigger portion for lnder.

451
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,196
Can I come with you?

452
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,727
Where?

453
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:17,132
I have to learn about the business
someday, might as well start today.

454
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:24,172
If you need money just ask Nina.
She'll arrange it for you.

455
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,437
If I needed money,
I'd have asked for it.

456
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:29,511
Last time you came to office
wanting to 'learn the ropes'

457
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,979
you put a gun to the accountant's
head and took away the cash.

458
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:39,192
If you still recall that event,
that means you haven't forgiven me.

459
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,144
Good Morning...
- Morning, Mr. Chauhan.

460
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,549
Morning, Mr. Singh. Please sit down.

461
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:21,592
How can I help you?

462
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,268
The C.M.
has agreed to give our company...

463
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,272
...the contract to
make the expressway.

464
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,207
Excellent.
Congratulations, Mr. Chauhan.

465
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,802
Thanks to Ms. Nina's convincing
power that it happened.

466
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:35,879
Can I be of any service?

467
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,851
The expressway will reduce the
Delhi-Mathura distance by twenty minutes

468
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:44,057
but it will have to run
through agricultural land.

469
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,428
The government has the right
to take anybody's land. Doesn't it?

470
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,691
But those farmers
are also the vote bank.

471
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,435
The expressway will benefit
the city people with cars...

472
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,372
...more than the villagers.

473
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,534
Hmmm...

474
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:04,411
The C.M. wants us to negotiate
the deal with the farmers.

475
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,913
Bargain for a fixed price,

476
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,382
and get the signatures of
the farmers on the transfer deeds.

477
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,181
The project's worth thirty
thousand crores, Mr. Yashwardhan.

478
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,749
And there is always
a fear of agitation.

479
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:20,159
That's why the government
doesn't want to be involved directly.

480
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,726
And our cut is one percent
of the entire deal.

481
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,734
This is the first time you've seen me.

482
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,142
You didn't even know I was alive.

483
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,874
Won't you say something?

484
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,386
Ask me something?

485
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,847
The one you kicked
out so many years ago...

486
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,222
...you want to talk to him now?

487
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:57,425
I ran away from Yashwardhan...

488
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,695
Leaving one of your children behind!

489
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:07,267
Twins may seem identical
to the world...

490
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,577
...but a mother always
knows the difference.

491
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,148
Which one cries longer...

492
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:18,015
who needs more feeding...

493
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,917
needs more care...

494
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,924
I left that child behind,

495
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:26,884
who wouldn't have
been able to live the life

496
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,952
that I had chosen for myself.

497
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,326
The weaker one.

498
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:40,339
I didn't have the courage
to keep that child away...

499
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,977
...from Yashwardhan's
money and luxury.

500
00:46:56,146 --> 00:47:01,255
Never go in an expensive car
when you're offering someone money.

501
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:06,595
If you display your
wealth he will ask for more.

502
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:16,975
The heart is a free spirit,

503
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:21,573
Understands all.

504
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:28,849
The heart is a free spirit,

505
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:32,689
Understands all.

506
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,696
Talk to the other farm owners
and let us know as soon as possible.

507
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,288
Yes.

508
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,213
Heart feels no peace
with all that it sees

509
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:05,192
Very gentle threads

510
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:08,230
With a tender weave.

511
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:14,234
God is always fair

512
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,897
Let go and be...

513
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:20,203
He is always there.

514
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:25,976
The heart is a free spirit,

515
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:30,416
Understands all.

516
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:37,988
The heart is a free spirit,

517
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:42,019
Understands all.

518
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,883
When you came here from Chandigarh
to become a pop singer,

519
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,579
I knew you were a capable girl.

520
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:11,889
All the other girls with you
have become upper class escorts now...

521
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:13,855
but you...

522
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:17,130
You can be the heir
to Yashwardhan's empire...

523
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:20,826
...and that too by sleeping
with just one man!

524
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,866
Should I move you
with those escorts as well?

525
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,836
I'm doing everything exactly
the way you asked me to.

526
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:33,308
Had you done it that way, then Ajay
would not be in the office every day.

527
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,574
Why is he taking so much
interest in the business?

528
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:41,247
He is a rich spoilt brat and
your job is to spoil him further.

529
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:44,554
To keep cocaine up his nose
and his mouth filled with alcohol.

530
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,857
He should be seen at the night club...
hitting a few people!

531
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,488
Picking up girls!

532
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,766
Why is he coming to the office?

533
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,695
Since his accident,

534
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,301
he doesn't drink too much...

535
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:58,873
and he doesn't touch cocaine at all.

536
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:01,068
Does he sleep with you?

537
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,819
May be he is bored with you.

538
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,925
I'll try harder to keep him
away from the office and business.

539
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:26,228
Please do, because if I feel
that he's lost interest in you...

540
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:32,732
...then I have many more men
who will take an interest in you.

541
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,169
That too, on a per night basis.

542
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,087
Ajay?

543
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,555
I was just...
- At home, so late at night?

544
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,927
Not out with friends?

545
00:50:58,188 --> 00:50:59,428
I am a bit tired.

546
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,629
Since when have you become shy?

547
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:05,698
Not at all.

548
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,222
What's the matter?

549
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,319
Nothing, dad.

550
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,825
Have you done something
that I need to handle? Hmm?

551
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,003
No, dad.

552
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,108
This expression of yours...

553
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,173
...always scares me.

554
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:48,872
Which expression?

555
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,718
Exactly this one.
Same as your mother's expression.

556
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:59,524
I would never have thought
that you could go on your mother.

557
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:03,721
Mother?

558
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,159
What happened to her?

559
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,738
I have told you so many times...

560
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:17,410
I don't remember perhaps.
Tell me again.

561
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,605
You've grown up now.

562
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:22,115
You hang out with friends,
and don't get time to ask me anything.

563
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,379
Well, I am asking you today.

564
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,687
A few cops wanted to shoot me,

565
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:36,926
but the car they attacked
had your mother and brother in it.

566
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:39,791
Did you love her?

567
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:44,997
Yes.

568
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,204
Do you miss her?

569
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:52,836
Yes.

570
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,611
Do you ever look at her old photos?

571
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,654
She was a police informer.

572
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,723
I burned all the photos
when I came to know.

573
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,831
And your other son?

574
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,296
Don't you miss him?

575
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:18,872
If he were alive,

576
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:24,746
he would've been as old
as me and looked exactly like me.

577
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,880
Ajay sir, Ms. Ritu has asked
me to inform you that she is here.

578
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,882
Go. I shall sleep now.

579
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:53,963
N.P. Developers and the Chief Minister
have a deal to make an expressway,

580
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,633
which will cut through
the farmers' lands.

581
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,880
The responsibility of convincing and
bargaining with the farmers has been

582
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,347
given to Yashwardhan.

583
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,076
Blue prints of the expressway.

584
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,252
Copy of the transfer
deeds of the farmers.

585
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:30,272
Lock up all the people on our list.

586
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:35,711
But we don't know how many of
these genuinely work for Yashwardhan.

587
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,209
Yes.

588
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,278
Some chaff always
gets crushed with the wheat.

589
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:46,791
If you really want to cause harm, then
slap Yashwardhan on both his cheeks.

590
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:53,692
You take one side. I know
exactly how to slap him on the other.

591
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,670
Tell me, Mr. Ahuja.
- Yes.

592
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,639
In an agricultural area...
- Yes... yes...

593
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,038
What will be the value
of these plots of land?

594
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,134
It's peanuts!

595
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,406
Peanuts?

596
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:09,239
And what if an expressway
were to cut through it?

597
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:10,811
Expressway?

598
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,413
Nanak Chauhan has got the contract.

599
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,988
I know which area it covers.

600
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,954
The plots along that
area will be empty.

601
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,223
Once the expressway comes,

602
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:26,256
then there will be enough scope for
malls, cinemas and everything else.

603
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:27,266
They're available.

604
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,931
Whose they are and where they are,

605
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:30,197
I'll let you know
when the time is right.

606
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:35,240
However, I'll decide the
cost of purchase from the farmers.

607
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,774
You just start preparing
to buy the land.

608
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,347
Done?

609
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,882
Done.

610
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:50,150
The C.M. has given the contract to
Nanak Chauhan to make the expressway.

611
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,653
Must have taken a huge cut.

612
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,897
Farmers' lands have been
bought for a throwaway price.

613
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:59,562
However, the competing builder
Mr. Ahuja is paying double...

614
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,568
...the price for the
surrounding plots of land.

615
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,570
Everyone is making money,

616
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:07,634
except us who are just
sitting doing nothing.

617
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:12,069
Why don't you fight for
the farmers' rights I say!

618
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:16,141
In the next election...

619
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:20,014
...these farmers will vote for you.

620
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:24,020
NP Developers! Down, down!

621
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,721
Haryana government down, down!

622
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,491
Until the time farmers
get their rightful dues,

623
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,191
the expressway will not be made.

624
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:35,132
Expressway shall not be made!

625
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:37,432
The situation in Chandela
is very volatile.

626
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,303
Orders are to deploy forces there.

627
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,441
In the next 24 hours the
situation should be under control.

628
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,007
Am I understood?

629
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,573
You can go.

630
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:54,916
Situation needs to be out-of-control,
not under-control.

631
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,686
Go back... go back

632
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,586
Police, go back.

633
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,994
Go back... go back

634
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,998
Police, go back.

635
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,364
Go back... go back.

636
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,101
Police go back.

637
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,139
Go back... go back

638
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,805
Police go back.
- Step back.

639
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:16,207
Go back... go back...
- Step back.

640
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,044
Don't touch me.

641
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:20,747
Charge.

642
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,148
Charge.

643
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:31,185
Had I not fired,
he would have shot me.

644
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,255
Come on, brother-in-law.

645
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,311
The protests against the construction
of the expressway...

646
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,210
...took a violent turn
today in Chandela village.

647
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,578
The farmers of Chandela
want to re-negotiate

648
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,777
the price of their land with
NP Developers since their competitors,

649
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:09,414
Ahuja Builders, have offered double
the price for the surrounding land.

650
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:13,016
The state government
is silent on this whole issue.

651
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,892
Angry farmers in Chandela
have burned down...

652
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,023
...some trucks of NP Developers
on the construction site too.

653
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:21,330
In order to control the situation,
the police used batons

654
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,393
and tear gas to disperse the crowd.

655
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,905
However, the situation
could not be controlled.

656
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,966
As a result the police opened fire...

657
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:31,808
...and a farmer boy was killed.

658
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,142
I'll be precise.

659
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,411
The police never wanted to control
the violence in Chandela village.

660
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,077
And a few smugglers
have been arrested...

661
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:40,711
...who work for you.

662
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:44,224
How did the police
know they are my people?

663
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,651
There is a solid police
informer within your gang.

664
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,558
Only one or two cops know of him.

665
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,775
Dad... Dad...

666
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,080
Dad... Dad...

667
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:19,892
You?

668
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,629
Why are you standing
here alone in the dark?

669
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:28,030
My father had left a case pending.

670
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,832
Today my Uncle and
I have completed it.

671
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,071
Are you happy

672
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,069
Yes.

673
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,777
So at least smile for once.

674
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,424
Lay the dinner.

675
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,390
I am hungry.

676
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:56,263
Do you love me?

677
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,163
Meaning?

678
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:04,933
It's a simple question,
not a difficult police case.

679
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:11,007
If there is a difference
between loving and being around,

680
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,878
then I have no answer for you.

681
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:18,982
I think my father loved me a lot...

682
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:20,883
...but was never around.

683
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,816
At least I am around you...
you can see me.

684
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:30,159
And the one who cannot see
you with his eyes, what about him?

685
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:44,044
Doctor just confirmed
the pregnancy today.

686
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:52,947
It's OK even if you don't smile.

687
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,416
I know you won't be able
to express your happiness...

688
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,489
...but I know you are happy.

689
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,888
I'll set the dinner.

690
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,371
There is a police informer amongst us.

691
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,243
Who is the informer?

692
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:18,111
I don't know.

693
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:24,078
But we are cornered from all sides.

694
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:32,250
There are lots of people vying
to take over my empire after I die.

695
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,661
Nina is also one of them...

696
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,826
They will not let you live either.

697
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,430
Go away.

698
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,973
Please don't think of all this, dad.
Just rest.

699
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,335
Ajay...

700
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,206
You asked me that day, didn't you...

701
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:59,144
...if I miss my other son or not?

702
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,485
I miss him a lot.

703
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:08,054
He was my favorite,

704
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,627
and you were your mother's...

705
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:18,666
...because you were
always a little weak.

706
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,305
Vishal!

707
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:29,106
I always felt that Vishal
would take over this family empire.

708
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:36,813
But he was also killed
with your mother.

709
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,623
Our time is finished, son.

710
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:43,989
Just go. Leave.

711
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,346
<i>Aurangzeb.</i>

712
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,583
All of Yashwardhan's men are in jail.

713
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:16,255
Once I present you in front of the
magistrate, as Ajay the state witness,

714
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,764
then I can put the
real Ajay behind bars.

715
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:20,533
Come on.

716
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:22,525
Sir,

717
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:28,104
I want a guarantee of
immunity for Yashwardhan.

718
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,202
Immunity?

719
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,511
I don't know, whatever the
word is in your government language.

720
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:37,315
But yes, he won't be going to jail.

721
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:38,745
Oh, sudden respect?

722
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,491
Apart from immunity should I also get
him the 'Indian of the year' award?

723
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:47,283
Vishal...

724
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:51,127
...but didn't we do
all this to send him to jail?

725
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,164
Sir, he is unwell!

726
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,326
He is a criminal.
- He is my father.

727
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:57,801
Your father? You snake!

728
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,166
He is not your father.
My father is your father.

729
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:04,339
Now shout at me. Shout.

730
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,209
Can you believe this, uncle?

731
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,579
My father ruined his life for them.

732
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,722
Career. Home. Everything.

733
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,293
For these thankless outsiders.

734
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:24,162
I agreed to do this only
to clear my stepfather's name...

735
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,423
...not for the two of you.

736
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:28,926
So don't do anything stupid now!

737
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:34,240
Once Yashwardhan is in jail then both
you and your mother will be free...

738
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,743
...from the threat she
was always protecting you from.

739
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,878
Really! Someone from
your side has told dad...

740
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,847
...that there is
an informer in his gang.

741
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:43,381
Who?

742
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,715
I don't know.
Some Sub-inspector Yadav told him.

743
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:52,188
But no one knows other than me,
Arya and Dev.

744
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:53,921
How can I trust you?

745
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,263
A man might have been
evil thirty years ago...

746
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,534
...and my mother might
have hated him then.

747
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:06,266
I have done as much harm
to him as I could in return.

748
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,209
However,
now I don't think he is evil...

749
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,911
...therefore I won't
cause any more harm to him

750
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,785
...or let any one else do so.

751
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:50,646
What's the matter?

752
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,085
Stressed?

753
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:01,523
The thing that I have
been striving for, for years,

754
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:08,997
has vanished just before
I could lay my hands on it.

755
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,805
So can't anything happen now?

756
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:17,835
Can't you do anything at all?

757
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,207
I can.

758
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,579
But I am unable to make
up my mind on a few things.

759
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,819
Over the past forty years
I've witnessed your status...

760
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,916
...and power increasing
with every decision.

761
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:36,292
If the decisions were right then,
they will surely be right now.

762
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,300
Whatever the decisions may be?

763
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:42,863
Of course.

764
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:47,169
Our kids never came
to know what bad times...

765
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,576
...and troubles we've been through.

766
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,740
The kids have only enjoyed
your power and money.

767
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:59,182
Their demands have always been met.

768
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:05,316
Dev, Trishla, Arya...
they bow in front of your power...

769
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,486
...like the rest of the world does.

770
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:12,290
Because you are like a king
who fulfills everyone's needs...

771
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:15,301
...both at the office and at home.

772
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:18,468
Be it someone's office
transfer or a promotion...

773
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,336
...or fixing files, you do it all.

774
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:27,646
The day you lose the power to do this,
who will bow in front of you?

775
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:34,844
That's why whatever
those decisions are...

776
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:38,748
make them... I am with you.

777
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:59,312
These are the names of the people
the police suspected...

778
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:01,278
...to be working for you.

779
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:06,178
The police arrested them all,

780
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,515
but released them later on.

781
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:12,985
Where did you get this list from?

782
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:17,556
I am not going to tell
you anything from now on, dad.

783
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,824
I am just going to
do it and show you. OK?

784
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,017
Take your papers and get
out of here in ten minutes.

785
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:43,283
Ajay! Disrespectful!

786
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:46,153
Mr. Chhabra.

787
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,554
Take him out of here...

788
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,230
...or I'll have to have
a word with Yashwardhan, directly.

789
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:54,795
I've informed him of this decision.

790
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,700
From today I'll be
handling the business.

791
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:19,753
Father-son! Both will be finished.

792
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:25,196
It's me who brings
the clients and the money.

793
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:31,898
Only those who want business dealings
with Yashwardhan Singh come to you.

794
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,075
Otherwise you are nothing.

795
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:40,442
From now on, the ones who have work
with dad will come directly to me.

796
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,650
You are not needed. Get out.

797
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,582
You bastard.

798
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:52,889
Ajay.

799
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:54,623
Congrats.

800
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:58,658
You've started your business...

801
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:01,231
...with a loss of fifteen
thousand million already.

802
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,102
Wars are not cheap, Mr. Chhabra.

803
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:09,073
And if they were wouldn't
everyone be at war?

804
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,779
The hand pulls the arrow,
and propels it,

805
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:21,343
but somewhere between the bow and
the target the arrow grows a brain.

806
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:25,449
The arrow doesn't
need to hit the target.

807
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,728
I released this arrow...

808
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,329
...to destroy Yashwardhan's empire.

809
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:35,900
But it destroyed the case
which my father had made years ago.

810
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:40,731
The arrested members of Yashwardhan's
gang had to be released.

811
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:45,775
And now Vishal is uprooting them
from the business like a disease.

812
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,718
Vishal is now siding with his father.
- Meaning?

813
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:37,229
Meaning, he is refusing
to co operate with us.

814
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:40,899
He is playing 'boss'
in Yashwardhan's office.

815
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:42,601
Vishal can't do that.

816
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,972
The dog has got this
meat after a lot of squealing.

817
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:48,735
He will enjoy it.

818
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:52,910
Do you still choose to keep quiet or
want to speak up about Yashwardhan?

819
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,575
Enjoying it, aren't you?

820
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,308
Well! I am having a great time too.

821
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,711
This oldie and I are
in the Big Boss house, right?

822
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,414
Weren't you very fond of making plans?

823
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:01,613
Now figure!

824
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,656
Let Vishal call my father 'dad'.

825
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:05,687
Let him sleep with
my girlfriend if he has to.

826
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:07,755
Ajay, Vishal is not like that!

827
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,188
Vishal is not like this!

828
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:10,753
Vishal is not like that!
How is Vishal?

829
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:11,763
Where is Vishal?

830
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:14,266
One, I can't see God
and the other - this Vishal.

831
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:16,963
The day I see him, I'll worship him.

832
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,872
What great sons you've borne.

833
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:27,006
One is a cheat and
the other an animal.

834
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,978
Papa made a mistake of
rescuing you a long time ago...

835
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,574
...from Yashwardhan's house.

836
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:35,281
My uncle and I will not
repeat the same mistake.

837
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:55,540
I've achieved whatever
I had planned to do for dad.

838
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,608
I am really happy today...

839
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,073
...and there is no one else other
than you to share this happiness with.

840
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:18,257
A fire burns in my breath,

841
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:21,834
Let it burn.

842
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:25,864
Let it burn.

843
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:33,702
This unbearable pain I sought

844
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,543
Let it hurt.

845
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,346
Let it hurt.

846
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:49,325
All strings are broken,
in this bright night.

847
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:56,893
Come sweet freedom,
in the destruction tonight.

848
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,934
Destruction

849
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:06,196
I can touch the sky,
I love this destruction.

850
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:41,509
When did you wake up?

851
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:43,642
Who are you?

852
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,150
What are you talking about, Ritu?

853
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:53,658
There is no place on my
body where you haven't bruised me.

854
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,256
What was that last night?

855
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:57,922
The tenderness?

856
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,022
Not a slap... no belt-pelt!

857
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,499
Ritu, please...

858
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,367
lam sorry. I am not complaining.

859
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,769
It's just that I've already
changed myself according to you...

860
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,209
...and now suddenly if
you show so much love towards me

861
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:13,303
And then if you come back
to your original self...

862
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:15,976
I don't think I'll be able to bear it.

863
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,608
I am not Ajay.

864
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,023
I am Vishal.

865
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:27,755
Ajay's twin brother.

866
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:36,502
Your mother and brother are dead.
Please, Ajay.

867
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,272
I am telling the truth.

868
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:48,378
I was raised by a police officer.

869
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:51,781
I used to call him 'papa'.

870
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,082
It's his family that
has placed me here...

871
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,884
...to finish off dad's empire.

872
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,635
I love you, Ritu.

873
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:18,241
Since the very first time I saw you.

874
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:24,473
The real girl that you've hidden
behind these books and photos...

875
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:28,788
I could see her right away, the
very first day when I walked in here.

876
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:36,362
There is no more truth than this...

877
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,925
...and there is no one
other than you I can say it to.

878
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:59,519
So it's you who gave the idea to Mr.
Ahuja to buy the land...

879
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:03,488
...around the proposed
expressway at double price?

880
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,386
Yes... I did give the idea

881
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,590
but the information
about the expressway...

882
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,957
...was given by someone else to me.

883
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,797
All the agreements, drafts...

884
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:15,801
...the blueprints and negotiations
are on this CD.

885
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:22,768
You brought no benefit
to anyone with this information

886
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:25,505
but definitely caused some damages.

887
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,774
Both to us and to Mr. Ahuja.

888
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:30,878
Because now thanks to these protests,

889
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,316
the expressway
definitely won't be made.

890
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:38,582
Everything gets made in this country,
but at it's own pace, Madam.

891
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,959
The point is...

892
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:44,020
...whether you are a part of it
or not at the time it does get made.

893
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:46,933
Now see, for example,

894
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:51,027
this small village in a corner
of Delhi has become a huge city...

895
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:52,938
'Gurgaon' today.

896
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:56,098
I have seen it grow.

897
01:18:56,598 --> 01:19:02,378
I can play this real estate development
game better than Yashwardhan.

898
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:05,349
I can defeat him whenever I want...

899
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:09,415
...exactly the way I
did in the expressway deal.

900
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,353
I don't work with
Yashwardhan any more.

901
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:14,316
Mr. Ahuja told me.

902
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:20,999
What if I get you a deal,
will you make it happen?

903
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:30,939
But you're retiring in 6 months.

904
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,702
I have my people in the department...

905
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:36,749
...a base that I've built
over many years of service.

906
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:38,676
My children are officers.

907
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:45,518
Besides, there won't be any police
restrictions on me once I retire.

908
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:48,851
So fine, we have a deal.

909
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:52,021
Uncle.

910
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:57,800
So all this was done to oust
Yashwardhan from the business?

911
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:01,036
Not for papa's case?

912
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:09,741
Today my son Arya is Assistant
Commissioner of Police.

913
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:12,516
Tomorrow he could be promoted
to a Deputy Commissioner of Police.

914
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:17,089
Who knows this city better than we do?

915
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:22,623
Then why should we spend our lives
like a retired or a suspended officer?

916
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:25,728
Why can't we rule this city?

917
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:31,130
Only two powers will
be running this country soon.

918
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:34,798
One political and the other corporate!

919
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:39,276
Either too much power
or too much money,

920
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:43,576
I definitely want one of them!

921
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,650
And will we leave Vishal back there?

922
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:54,325
If Ajay and Veera
don't exist any more...

923
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:59,498
...then Vishal can continue
denying that he is not Ajay...

924
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:02,333
...but who will believe him?

925
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:04,933
Simple!

926
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:20,548
We will plant new people, in place
of the older ones that were laid off.

927
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:23,912
And this time no one
will know you directly.

928
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:29,593
Mr. Chhabra suggested certain names,
which I wanted to discuss with you.

929
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:34,730
Whatever good has happened
so far is due to your decisions.

930
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,599
There is nothing for me to discuss.

931
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:40,763
Just be cautious.

932
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:45,742
All those people you've thrown
out will seek revenge some day.

933
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,850
How dare you...

934
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:55,985
How dare you?

935
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:58,153
Were you earning any less from us...

936
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:00,351
...that you went sucking
up to Yashwardhan as well?

937
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:01,791
I'm sorry I made a mistake.

938
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,321
Please forgive me
like a younger brother.

939
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:06,732
I made a huge mistake, Dev brother.

940
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:08,626
I'll talk to the DCP.

941
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,134
You will talk to the Boss?

942
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:12,432
You're nothing.

943
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:18,976
I made a huge mistake,
huge mistake, Dev brother.

944
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,739
Forgive me... I have little children.

945
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:27,311
May we live forever with our husbands.

946
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:31,482
May we live forever with our husbands.

947
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,515
Good evening, sir.

948
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:36,924
Vishnu brother, you... here?

949
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:40,263
Where is Arya?
I cannot get through to his number.

950
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:42,665
He's not in the office.

951
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:45,132
Sit down please. I'll find out.

952
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:25,304
Namaste, papa.

953
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:27,470
Namaste. ls your husband Vishnu home?

954
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:31,174
He is not answering, must be driving.

955
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:37,050
This phone's battery...
it needs charging again.

956
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:54,306
He'll be here, Trishla...

957
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:56,798
...don't worry so much.

958
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:10,820
Where are you? Your wife,
has been waiting for you.

959
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:14,320
Papa, Dev has killed Yadav.

960
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,921
Have you spoken to
anyone else about this?

961
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:20,255
I went to speak to Arya about it,

962
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:21,493
but he was not in the office.

963
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,661
Go to my office. Wait for me there.

964
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:25,164
I'll be there soon.

965
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:39,684
Where is he off to now?

966
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,302
Hi, this is Trishla Phogat.

967
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:59,395
Please leave a voice message after
the beep or send me a text message...

968
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:00,598
Thank you.

969
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:02,340
Vishnu.

970
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,808
Thank God you've come, dad.
- What happened?

971
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,277
All sorts of things are
going on behind your back.

972
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:10,209
Not here... Come into my office.

973
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:19,782
Dev and Arya are up
to something together.

974
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,589
Dev has killed Yadav.

975
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:22,987
What are you talking about?

976
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:24,462
Dev is out in Badarpur
since this morning.

977
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,361
He has signed in the
duty register as well.

978
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,092
I've seen it myself Papa.

979
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:30,393
That farmer boy in Chandela village...
- Keep it down!

980
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,869
...whose death worsened the riots...

981
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,133
Dev killed him as well.

982
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:36,633
No, you've not seen anything.

983
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:39,375
And you don't have any proof either.

984
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:41,242
And this?

985
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:43,947
This is evidence enough.

986
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:46,314
This woman and her son?

987
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:47,715
They are alive!

988
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,389
I respected Arya a lot, papa.

989
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,785
I even told him about
that Dev incident.

990
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:54,927
But despite knowing
that these two are alive,

991
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:57,087
he didn't even try to
clear Uncle Vijay's name.

992
01:25:57,185 --> 01:25:58,095
Vishnu.

993
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,293
How can he do this to his own father?

994
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:04,464
Give me this photo.

995
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,333
Please give it to me.

996
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:22,921
You knew everything, didn't you?

997
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,489
Just forget about it, Vishnu.

998
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:27,954
You won't understand it.

999
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:33,230
I've done all this to secure
the future of your kids, and my kids.

1000
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:37,366
Go home. Relax. OK?

1001
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:43,237
And you've neither seen Dev kill
anyone nor have you seen this picture.

1002
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,037
OK?

1003
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,271
I won't go home.

1004
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:50,477
I am going straight
to the Vigilance Bureau...

1005
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:55,118
...to complain about Arya and Dev.

1006
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:57,447
I even have uncle Vijay's diary...

1007
01:26:57,512 --> 01:27:00,618
...through which the vigilance
cell will find this woman and her son.

1008
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:04,555
Because this is not a family of
policemen, but a family of criminals!

1009
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,590
Killing innocent people,

1010
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:09,259
killing your fellow officers...

1011
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:25,480
I am sorry, so...

1012
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:28,485
you were not ready to listen.

1013
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:31,319
I had no other way.

1014
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:34,252
Sorry.

1015
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:50,443
Oh, my child, what did you do?

1016
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:52,033
Someone call the ambulance...

1017
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,377
...before I could stop
him he pulled my gun...

1018
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,848
...and killed himself...

1019
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:00,919
...someone call an ambulance.

1020
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:04,650
My child Vishnu... my son.

1021
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:16,734
So you've told Ajay
everything about us?

1022
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,126
What?

1023
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:34,450
Ritu.

1024
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:42,117
Ritu...
- Who did this? Who?

1025
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,091
Vishal...Vishal...

1026
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:48,826
Sorry Vishal... Vishal...

1027
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:54,770
Vishal...
- Baby... Shhh... Shhh...

1028
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,241
We'll be in the hospital in two minutes.
- Listen, Vishal...

1029
01:28:57,298 --> 01:29:00,302
Nina chose me
to be your girlfriend...

1030
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:02,609
...so that I could keep you,

1031
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:09,756
I mean Ajay,
addicted to cocaine and alcohol,

1032
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:13,455
but I fell in love with you, Vishal.

1033
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,820
I fell in love with you.

1034
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:20,058
Inder and Nina felt that
I've divulged something to you.

1035
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:23,695
And I let them think like that...

1036
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:31,604
...so that they don't
find out about you.

1037
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:36,881
I love you, Vishal. I love you.

1038
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:57,098
These are his belongings.

1039
01:29:58,693 --> 01:30:02,903
Ring, watch, chain, mobile.

1040
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:12,949
Sorry, we could not save Ritu.

1041
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,921
Vishnu.

1042
01:30:27,188 --> 01:30:29,395
Thank God you've come, dad.
- What happened?

1043
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:31,835
All sorts of things are
going on behind your back.

1044
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,966
Dev and Arya are up
to something together.

1045
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:36,667
Dev has killed Yadav.

1046
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,702
That farmer boy in Chandela village.

1047
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,575
Dev killed him as well.

1048
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:41,544
Papa.

1049
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:46,813
Vishnu's voice message
on Trishla's phone at 10:50 pm?

1050
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:50,281
This woman and her son.
They are alive!

1051
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:52,324
I respected Arya a lot, papa.

1052
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:54,415
But despite knowing
that these two are alive...

1053
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,962
...he didn't even try
to clear Uncle Vijay's name.

1054
01:30:57,018 --> 01:31:00,431
I am going straight
to the Vigilance Bureau.

1055
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:02,559
I even have uncle Vijay's diary,

1056
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:05,900
Through which the vigilance
cell will find this woman and her son.

1057
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:09,071
Because this is not a family of
policemen, but a family of criminals!

1058
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:12,673
Killing innocent people,
killing your fellow officers...

1059
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:20,076
I am sorry, son,
you were not ready to listen.

1060
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,816
Who collected Vishnu's mobile?

1061
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:26,556
Arya did.

1062
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:29,421
Arya.

1063
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:45,366
You.

1064
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:47,413
They killed Ritu.

1065
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:49,380
Who did?

1066
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:52,181
Nina's son lnder and his goons.

1067
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:54,677
You started the war.

1068
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:58,454
Foundations of empires
are always laid on corpses.

1069
01:31:59,413 --> 01:32:01,916
Yes, corpses.

1070
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:08,256
Nina and Bilal have
called me for a meeting.

1071
01:32:09,657 --> 01:32:11,227
Bilal just called.

1072
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,566
What meeting?

1073
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:19,470
I wanted to say something
to you before going to the meeting.

1074
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:23,712
We might have different
blood running in our veins...

1075
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:26,850
...but we were brought
up by the same father...

1076
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:30,385
...who always said...

1077
01:32:31,512 --> 01:32:35,517
'your own kin matters
more than your dreams'.

1078
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:39,726
Whatever I've done until today...

1079
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:42,759
...or whatever I am about to do,

1080
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:48,402
it's for my family, not for myself.

1081
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:51,741
I never wanted to create an empire.

1082
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:54,508
Vishal, where is your meeting?

1083
01:32:55,703 --> 01:32:58,946
If possible, don't include my
mother in your foundation of corpses.

1084
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:02,054
Vishal, where is your meeting?

1085
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:18,389
It's written in the Emperor Aurangzeb's
book 'kingship knows no kinship'.

1086
01:34:21,022 --> 01:34:23,764
'Kingship knows no kinship.'

1087
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:31,301
He believed that one's
own family should be killed...

1088
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:36,245
...before their ambitions
or stupidities...

1089
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:40,410
...ruin years of hard work.

1090
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:48,985
No one has the right to mess
around with someone's hard work.

1091
01:34:50,484 --> 01:34:54,022
So are dreams more
important than your own kin?

1092
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:58,367
Yes. But your father
believed otherwise.

1093
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:00,867
But...

1094
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:03,433
...what do you believe is right?

1095
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:08,672
I believe you are right, Uncle.

1096
01:35:10,938 --> 01:35:12,315
Good.

1097
01:35:13,674 --> 01:35:16,177
Did you find Vishnu's
mobile among his things?

1098
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,452
Where is it?

1099
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:31,063
Did you hear the voice message?

1100
01:35:36,964 --> 01:35:38,307
What do you think?

1101
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,405
Vishnu had lost his mind...

1102
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:44,777
...he was saying things
which had no base or evidence.

1103
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:48,152
And while he was talking he...

1104
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:51,756
Good.

1105
01:35:52,813 --> 01:35:54,190
Good.

1106
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:57,662
All is set, Arya.

1107
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:01,195
Tomorrow Vishal will attend
the meeting with Nina and gang.

1108
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:05,636
There he will transfer all
of Yashwardhan's company holdings.

1109
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,466
Where is the meeting?

1110
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:10,142
Vishal has been informed.

1111
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:12,505
As soon as the papers are signed...

1112
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:15,180
Yashwardhan will be
killed off in the hospital.

1113
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:19,507
You finish off Ajay and
your father's mistress. Got it?

1114
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:22,479
Yes.

1115
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:24,889
Good. Goodnight.

1116
01:36:33,087 --> 01:36:34,691
I am going to do something today.

1117
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:39,504
When you come to know
what I've done then,

1118
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:42,806
if possible, try not to judge me.

1119
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:47,510
All the money...
- Don't tell me where the money is.

1120
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:50,613
You'll need it.

1121
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:56,244
If I need it,
then you know where the money is.

1122
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:00,985
I don't want you to
go out thinking that...

1123
01:37:01,615 --> 01:37:03,561
...if Suman needs the money
then she knows where it is.

1124
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:07,997
She'll handle it,
if I don't make it back.

1125
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:11,230
You just come back to me.

1126
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,831
You've come alone!

1127
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,696
I was prepared to fight an army.

1128
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:48,431
Ajay...

1129
01:37:50,831 --> 01:37:51,673
Ajay...

1130
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:52,743
Ajay... listen to me.

1131
01:38:00,074 --> 01:38:01,610
Ajay... listen to me.

1132
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:09,623
Ajay... listen to me.

1133
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,193
Ajay...

1134
01:38:18,192 --> 01:38:21,537
Stay down, you cheap officer.
Stay down, you're done today.

1135
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:24,371
No, Ajay! No.

1136
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:26,407
Leave me.
- You won't kill anyone.

1137
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,706
Leave me, old woman!

1138
01:38:33,674 --> 01:38:34,846
No, Ajay!

1139
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:35,677
Leave me.

1140
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:36,481
Leave me.

1141
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:37,811
Leave me.

1142
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:39,451
Leave.

1143
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:42,727
Leave me, old woman.
- No, you won't become like your father.

1144
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:46,094
Leave me, leave me.

1145
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:48,656
Leave me. Leave me. Mother!

1146
01:39:04,405 --> 01:39:05,907
I said that by mistake.

1147
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:09,185
I am not your son and
you are not my mother.

1148
01:39:17,851 --> 01:39:19,057
Listen, you cop...

1149
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:22,059
...whether you show me a gun
or a grenade, nothing can stop me.

1150
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:23,359
<i>L</i> am going-

1151
01:39:23,424 --> 01:39:25,529
Worship her, give her a medal,
do whatever you want.

1152
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:27,870
You want to go...

1153
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:32,209
Go.

1154
01:39:35,569 --> 01:39:37,048
Take my car.

1155
01:39:38,172 --> 01:39:40,379
Even if someone sees you,
they won't stop you.

1156
01:39:57,391 --> 01:39:59,997
I've been sent here
to kill both of you.

1157
01:40:04,631 --> 01:40:07,805
Uncle wants to take
over Yashwardhan's business.

1158
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:13,311
Nina's son has killed Ritu,
and Vishal has gone mad.

1159
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:21,625
Bilal and Nina have
called Vishal for a meeting,

1160
01:40:22,783 --> 01:40:26,663
where they'll ask him to hand over
the control of Yashwardhan's business.

1161
01:40:27,554 --> 01:40:31,627
The minute he signs they
will kill Yashwardhan in hospital.

1162
01:40:31,925 --> 01:40:33,996
And Vishal will be killed
in that meeting, right!

1163
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:39,369
I'm afraid Vishal will
kill lnder and everyone else...

1164
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:41,674
...in the meeting
to avenge Ritu's death.

1165
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:46,177
It will be impossible to clean
Vishal's criminal record after that.

1166
01:40:46,907 --> 01:40:50,753
Let him die, the so called
'prodigal son' of his parents.

1167
01:40:54,248 --> 01:40:55,921
I can't let him die.

1168
01:40:57,284 --> 01:41:01,027
They are my father's
25 years of labour.

1169
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:03,991
He is my brother.

1170
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:06,635
Long live that Vishal...

1171
01:41:06,693 --> 01:41:09,173
...whom the mother, the father,
the step brother, the step father...

1172
01:41:09,229 --> 01:41:10,469
all keep on a pedestal.

1173
01:41:10,831 --> 01:41:12,333
Everyone is worried about him.

1174
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,904
Go, stop him.

1175
01:41:17,571 --> 01:41:19,414
I don't want to stop him.

1176
01:41:21,308 --> 01:41:23,015
It's very important
for this meeting to happen.

1177
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:26,449
Because neither Uncle
nor Nina will do anything...

1178
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:27,924
...till the end of this meeting.

1179
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:32,861
Just that Vishal should not
sign anything and not kill anyone.

1180
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,864
And Vishal knows nothing... right!

1181
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:37,698
But at least you know, don't you?

1182
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:42,597
If I place you there instead of Vishal

1183
01:41:43,363 --> 01:41:47,106
...then you won't sign anything
and nor will you kill anyone.

1184
01:41:50,037 --> 01:41:51,675
Ajay will not go anywhere.

1185
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:56,521
I don't want to lose him again.

1186
01:41:57,511 --> 01:42:00,924
I will go,
not for that Vishal but for myself.

1187
01:42:01,582 --> 01:42:04,995
I don't want to live with the tag of
'weak and useless' all my life.

1188
01:42:12,025 --> 01:42:13,561
And yes...

1189
01:42:14,394 --> 01:42:20,538
if <i>I</i> die,
then I will never forgive any of you...

1190
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:28,011
...you've all harassed me a lot.

1191
01:42:51,765 --> 01:42:53,039
Inspector Singh.

1192
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:55,713
Place one police vehicle outside
Yashwardhan's house...

1193
01:42:55,802 --> 01:42:57,975
...to tail Ajay Singh as he leaves.

1194
01:42:58,238 --> 01:42:59,148
Yes, Sir...

1195
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:02,050
Don't utter a word
to anyone about this.

1196
01:43:23,664 --> 01:43:25,007
Follow him!

1197
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:46,324
Baldev!

1198
01:43:46,887 --> 01:43:50,357
Sir, Ajay is heading towards MG road.

1199
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:13,255
Nina has a suite in
this hotel on the 17th floor.

1200
01:44:32,532 --> 01:44:33,533
Singh.

1201
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:35,370
I want two police parties
outside Marriot...

1202
01:44:35,469 --> 01:44:37,176
...and one outside Lifecare.

1203
01:44:37,237 --> 01:44:40,013
But who do we have to catch?

1204
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:41,848
Just send the teams to the locations.

1205
01:44:42,075 --> 01:44:43,645
You haven't said anything to anyone,
have you?

1206
01:44:44,478 --> 01:44:45,479
No, sir.

1207
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:47,286
Good. I'll call you back.

1208
01:45:00,527 --> 01:45:03,098
If this is in my hand,
then I might fire in nervousness.

1209
01:45:03,764 --> 01:45:05,368
They will be armed.

1210
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:07,771
According to them I'll come armed.

1211
01:45:08,302 --> 01:45:12,307
As they say, the one who's
unarmed is the biggest threat.

1212
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:28,832
Vishal!

1213
01:45:47,107 --> 01:45:47,710
Yes, say.

1214
01:45:48,475 --> 01:45:50,216
Yes, arrived.
- Fine.

1215
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:52,954
I'll call you as soon
as I get an update from the meeting.

1216
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:06,933
Hello!

1217
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:08,505
It's me, Singh.

1218
01:46:10,797 --> 01:46:12,470
Whose number is this?

1219
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:15,712
Whenever this number
flashes on your phone next,

1220
01:46:15,769 --> 01:46:18,010
just raid the suite
on the 17th floor.

1221
01:46:18,905 --> 01:46:20,782
Has the other team reached
the hospital?

1222
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:22,645
They should be reaching
any moment, sir.

1223
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:30,259
Raid both the places at the same time.

1224
01:46:30,751 --> 01:46:32,526
Up here you will find Ajay Singh.

1225
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:36,627
DCP's informer.
Get him to safety first.

1226
01:46:37,657 --> 01:46:40,570
The other team will arrest
Yashwardhan from the hospital.

1227
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:41,934
Yes, sir.

1228
01:46:45,799 --> 01:46:49,337
My people are in the hotel
and will be waiting for your call.

1229
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:56,617
This is to record everything that
will be discussed in Nina's meeting.

1230
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:37,790
Ajay!

1231
01:47:41,488 --> 01:47:42,432
Why have you called me?

1232
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:50,672
What is this?

1233
01:47:50,864 --> 01:47:53,276
All the legal front papers.

1234
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,911
These are the papers to
return all those businesses...

1235
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:59,416
...back to us that you took away.

1236
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:03,144
The rest are Yashwardhan's
company's share transfer deeds.

1237
01:48:03,443 --> 01:48:08,358
Your resignation letter.
Power of attorney, etc.

1238
01:48:08,782 --> 01:48:10,159
Even if I believe
that you all can run...

1239
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,991
...the legal fronts
of Yashwardhan's business,

1240
01:48:12,919 --> 01:48:14,921
...but I don't think any of you
will be able to run the illegal front.

1241
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:18,194
Leave that to us.

1242
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:22,269
What if I don't sign?

1243
01:48:22,662 --> 01:48:25,575
If you don't sign then your
father will be killed in the hospital.

1244
01:48:25,732 --> 01:48:27,837
He is your father as well.
Ask your mother.

1245
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:28,572
Ajay!

1246
01:48:28,802 --> 01:48:29,940
Don't shout!

1247
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:32,172
Don't think just because
Yashwardhan is old...

1248
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:34,742
...and ill you can
take over his business.

1249
01:48:35,408 --> 01:48:38,548
Say sorry and sit down.

1250
01:48:39,212 --> 01:48:42,125
Sorry brother, sorry Ms. Nina.

1251
01:48:43,617 --> 01:48:45,426
Please do take over the business.

1252
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:48,628
And all these people
will be working under you.

1253
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:54,733
But do they know they will in fact...

1254
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:58,871
...be working for DCP
Ravikant and not for you?

1255
01:49:01,968 --> 01:49:04,744
Mr. Ahuja, am I not right?

1256
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:06,879
Let him speak, lnder.

1257
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:14,624
Speak, Ajay.

1258
01:49:16,283 --> 01:49:18,695
Mr. Ahuja, speak up, don't be shy.

1259
01:49:18,985 --> 01:49:21,261
Who told you about the expressway?

1260
01:49:21,821 --> 01:49:24,495
The meeting that took place between
you and Ms. Nina two days ago...

1261
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:26,799
...who was it with?

1262
01:49:33,133 --> 01:49:34,203
What is he saying, Ms. Nina?

1263
01:49:37,137 --> 01:49:39,344
He wants to create a rift between us.

1264
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,613
Sign it.

1265
01:49:43,209 --> 01:49:45,485
Let him say everything, Bilal.

1266
01:49:53,486 --> 01:49:55,193
I am taking you to Veera.

1267
01:49:55,755 --> 01:49:58,429
Dad's life is in danger.
I want to go there.

1268
01:49:58,491 --> 01:50:02,462
He's not in danger. My officers
are there to arrest your father.

1269
01:50:02,562 --> 01:50:05,873
I don't trust you or your officers.

1270
01:50:05,932 --> 01:50:07,468
To hell with your trust.

1271
01:50:07,968 --> 01:50:11,245
My job was to kill Ajay and
Veera and let you die in the hotel.

1272
01:50:12,105 --> 01:50:14,210
Just free my hands, Arya.
Just free them.

1273
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:16,446
I am not doing this
to gain your trust.

1274
01:50:17,544 --> 01:50:20,957
My dead father asked me
to protect you and your mother...

1275
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:23,985
...and I did not do that.

1276
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:26,155
I want to set that right.

1277
01:50:27,187 --> 01:50:28,393
And am I not doing the same thing?

1278
01:50:29,089 --> 01:50:32,195
My father trusted me and
shared a lot of things with me...

1279
01:50:32,258 --> 01:50:33,737
...and I ruined it too.

1280
01:50:34,728 --> 01:50:37,106
I need to set a few things right,
if not all of them.

1281
01:50:37,931 --> 01:50:38,875
Let me go, Arya!

1282
01:50:38,932 --> 01:50:41,640
Ajay will be caught in the hotel and
you will be caught in the hospital.

1283
01:50:41,901 --> 01:50:44,541
Both of you will go to jail.
That is if you are caught alive.

1284
01:50:48,008 --> 01:50:49,578
Wasn't that the plan?

1285
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:55,583
To put the entire Yashwardhan's
gang in jail or finish them off?

1286
01:50:57,117 --> 01:51:02,123
And we did it together,
me, you and your uncle.

1287
01:51:03,923 --> 01:51:06,096
Just let me go, Arya, please.

1288
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:11,766
Think of your mother, Vishal.

1289
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:15,577
You can take care of mother better.

1290
01:51:16,803 --> 01:51:18,180
Dad is alone.

1291
01:51:24,878 --> 01:51:26,516
You will all work for Nina.

1292
01:51:26,613 --> 01:51:29,822
The police will come to know everything
about you and your businesses.

1293
01:51:29,983 --> 01:51:32,486
Then they will use you
in any and every way possible...

1294
01:51:32,552 --> 01:51:34,828
...and finally throw you away.

1295
01:51:36,289 --> 01:51:38,565
Yes, DCP Ravikant is with us.

1296
01:51:38,658 --> 01:51:41,730
Yes, I met him with Mr. Ahuja.

1297
01:51:42,662 --> 01:51:46,735
Not to sell you all out,
but to buy out Ravikant instead.

1298
01:51:47,167 --> 01:51:50,842
We all give monetary
cuts to the police, don't we?

1299
01:51:51,805 --> 01:51:56,220
Instead of bribing them why don't
we give them a share in the profits?

1300
01:51:56,676 --> 01:51:58,883
That way they won't check us...

1301
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:02,652
...because even if they did
discover a few of our illegalities...

1302
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:06,963
...we would be able
to discover theirs. Right?

1303
01:52:46,826 --> 01:52:47,463
Inder!!

1304
01:52:47,527 --> 01:52:48,835
Leave him. What are you doing?

1305
01:52:51,564 --> 01:52:52,907
What are you doing?

1306
01:53:00,173 --> 01:53:01,914
Let him go.

1307
01:53:02,008 --> 01:53:03,419
Police!

1308
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:04,716
Put your gun down.

1309
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:06,257
You put it first.

1310
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:12,861
Inder!

1311
01:53:49,556 --> 01:53:52,469
There has been a shoot
out in the Hotel Marriot,

1312
01:53:55,562 --> 01:53:59,135
policemen from your station said
that you've sent a team there.

1313
01:54:01,434 --> 01:54:03,345
How did you get to
know about the Marriot?

1314
01:54:04,871 --> 01:54:05,440
That...

1315
01:54:05,538 --> 01:54:08,917
You've sent a team to the hospital
as well to protect Yashwardhan!

1316
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:12,917
Yes.

1317
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:17,890
What did you think? By arresting
Vishal you could save him?

1318
01:54:18,718 --> 01:54:20,891
Do you know why a person loses?

1319
01:54:21,387 --> 01:54:23,958
A person loses because
he places his trust in others.

1320
01:54:24,557 --> 01:54:26,059
The way I trusted you...

1321
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:29,196
...because I couldn't be
in so many places at the same time.

1322
01:54:29,796 --> 01:54:31,833
Likewise now you cannot be
with Veera in the village...

1323
01:54:31,931 --> 01:54:34,639
...and with Suman
at home at the same time.

1324
01:54:56,990 --> 01:54:57,934
What are you guys doing here?

1325
01:54:58,391 --> 01:54:59,699
Following orders from the ACP.

1326
01:54:59,759 --> 01:55:01,898
OK. Now we have orders from the DCP.

1327
01:55:02,562 --> 01:55:05,543
We'll arrest Yashwardhan,
you guys leave.

1328
01:55:05,632 --> 01:55:07,168
Right, sir.
- Come on.

1329
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:12,213
What happened, Ajay?

1330
01:55:12,438 --> 01:55:14,543
The police planned to kill you.

1331
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:28,298
Leave my hand.

1332
01:55:33,159 --> 01:55:34,297
Come on... bloody...

1333
01:55:38,298 --> 01:55:39,572
I need more force.

1334
01:55:40,633 --> 01:55:41,441
Check there.

1335
01:55:41,534 --> 01:55:42,945
Hello... Excuse me...

1336
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:44,673
Excuse me...

1337
01:55:46,339 --> 01:55:47,613
Excuse me...

1338
01:55:50,543 --> 01:55:52,887
Hey, Doctor,
I want all these floors vacated.

1339
01:55:52,946 --> 01:55:55,517
A gangster and his son are
trying to escape through here.

1340
01:55:55,615 --> 01:55:57,561
Clear your staff
and patients from here.

1341
01:56:00,687 --> 01:56:02,894
There is no way out of here, dad.

1342
01:56:04,757 --> 01:56:06,930
Our time is gone.

1343
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:12,002
I told you to go away. Didn't I?

1344
01:56:12,432 --> 01:56:14,469
I couldn't leave you.

1345
01:56:16,869 --> 01:56:18,109
Dad.

1346
01:56:21,874 --> 01:56:25,720
If you fight, you'll die with me.

1347
01:56:27,046 --> 01:56:28,787
Let's surrender, come on.

1348
01:56:28,848 --> 01:56:30,919
They won't let us surrender, dad.

1349
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:33,430
They won't be able
to fire openly either...

1350
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:35,159
...if we don't give them
a reason to shoot at us.

1351
01:56:35,555 --> 01:56:36,329
Come on.

1352
01:56:36,656 --> 01:56:37,464
Come on.

1353
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:51,209
Don't shoot.

1354
01:56:52,472 --> 01:56:53,974
Don't shoot.

1355
01:56:54,874 --> 01:56:57,013
Don't shoot. We'll surrender.

1356
01:56:58,578 --> 01:57:00,285
We'll surrender.

1357
01:57:01,948 --> 01:57:03,450
Just take us to the police station.

1358
01:57:03,549 --> 01:57:05,529
Just take us to the police station.
- Dad.

1359
01:58:46,352 --> 01:58:47,490
Vishal?

1360
01:58:50,656 --> 01:58:51,430
No, dad...

1361
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:54,069
Ajay.

1362
01:58:59,999 --> 01:59:01,342
I am Vishal,

1363
01:59:02,568 --> 01:59:04,206
the informer in your gang.

1364
01:59:06,672 --> 01:59:09,744
I lived as Ajay all
this while with you.

1365
01:59:15,781 --> 01:59:16,919
<i>Veera'?</i>

1366
01:59:24,257 --> 01:59:26,863
Wasn't Arya taking
you to the village?

1367
01:59:27,793 --> 01:59:28,533
Why have you come here?

1368
01:59:28,928 --> 01:59:30,202
To save dad.

1369
01:59:32,265 --> 01:59:33,801
So do you want a 'son
of the year' trophy or what?

1370
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:34,905
Ajay.

1371
01:59:35,835 --> 01:59:38,645
Our mother wasn't mad
to take you away from all this...

1372
01:59:38,704 --> 01:59:39,842
...years ago.

1373
01:59:39,906 --> 01:59:43,251
Mom lost nothing because of me,
but dad has.

1374
01:59:46,779 --> 01:59:50,056
We weren't exactly saints
before you came here.

1375
01:59:50,116 --> 01:59:51,390
We were already a target...

1376
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:53,191
...you just hastened the process.
- Let go of me.

1377
01:59:59,692 --> 02:00:01,603
Dad, just forgive him
and throw him out of here.

1378
02:00:03,129 --> 02:00:05,609
Would you be able to
take care of dad if I go?

1379
02:00:05,898 --> 02:00:08,606
You were a rogue,
roughing up, beating up people,

1380
02:00:08,701 --> 02:00:11,477
being rude to your father,
stealing money from his office...

1381
02:00:11,571 --> 02:00:13,346
...thrashing Ritu and you
will take care of him?

1382
02:00:13,406 --> 02:00:14,407
Vishal...

1383
02:00:17,910 --> 02:00:19,287
Ajay is correct.

1384
02:00:22,081 --> 02:00:24,789
Everything was wrong before you came...

1385
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:28,763
...you came and set everything right.

1386
02:00:32,725 --> 02:00:36,867
If Veera wins in this fight...

1387
02:00:37,563 --> 02:00:42,342
...then she must win
without losing anything.

1388
02:00:48,274 --> 02:00:51,278
Fine. Dad has forgiven you. Now go.

1389
02:00:57,016 --> 02:00:58,290
This is for Arya.

1390
02:01:04,724 --> 02:01:06,067
Go.

1391
02:01:15,701 --> 02:01:16,702
Go.

1392
02:03:19,859 --> 02:03:20,564
Put your gun down.

1393
02:03:23,129 --> 02:03:24,506
It's the ACP's orders.

1394
02:03:26,232 --> 02:03:29,008
Ajay Singh has to be arrested.

1395
02:03:29,602 --> 02:03:30,740
No one will fire.

1396
02:04:29,195 --> 02:04:30,230
Ajay gave this.

1397
02:04:32,531 --> 02:04:33,475
Ajay?

1398
02:04:33,799 --> 02:04:36,143
He came to the hospital to save dad.

1399
02:04:36,669 --> 02:04:38,376
Yashwardhan and Ajay were arrested?

1400
02:04:38,671 --> 02:04:39,615
I don't know.

1401
02:04:39,738 --> 02:04:41,615
They sent me away from there...

1402
02:04:42,441 --> 02:04:46,947
...saying that if
Veera wins this fight...

1403
02:04:47,313 --> 02:04:50,556
...then she must win
without losing anything.

1404
02:05:10,269 --> 02:05:11,805
Take mother away, Vishal.

1405
02:05:13,172 --> 02:05:15,174
Leaving you all alone?

1406
02:05:16,342 --> 02:05:19,949
The years of labour done by your
mother and my father will be wasted...

1407
02:05:20,045 --> 02:05:22,548
...if you kill anyone.

1408
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:27,558
Vishal, please take
mother away from here.

1409
02:06:14,633 --> 02:06:16,340
Allowed them to run away, did you?

1410
02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:20,050
I didn't let them go anywhere, Uncle.

1411
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:23,580
I came here to kill them...

1412
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:27,357
...but the house was already
on fire when I arrived.

1413
02:06:28,213 --> 02:06:29,954
I could hear them
screaming from inside.

1414
02:06:30,249 --> 02:06:32,058
By now they must be charred.

1415
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:33,723
Right!

1416
02:06:34,286 --> 02:06:38,393
Exactly the way your father
killed them 25 years ago?

1417
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:42,695
Yes.

1418
02:06:44,964 --> 02:06:47,205
Why did you do all this, Arya?

1419
02:06:48,767 --> 02:06:51,475
You wanted to take my
place in the collection system?

1420
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:56,852
I don't want anything
from your collection empire.

1421
02:06:57,643 --> 02:06:59,884
I am going to finish everything today.

1422
02:07:01,347 --> 02:07:04,351
This has the entire recording
of Nina's meeting today...

1423
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:11,565
...and I've left a recording of
Vishnu's phone at home for Trishla.

1424
02:07:13,425 --> 02:07:16,406
My son and your
brother Dev got killed.

1425
02:07:17,596 --> 02:07:18,939
And Vishnu?

1426
02:07:20,232 --> 02:07:21,802
Was he nothing to me?

1427
02:07:24,503 --> 02:07:25,948
Isn't Trishla my sister?

1428
02:07:26,071 --> 02:07:28,312
Why did you do all this?

1429
02:07:28,674 --> 02:07:30,119
You bastard.

1430
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:34,992
So you turned out to be
your father's son after all!

1431
02:07:37,449 --> 02:07:38,655
Yes, Uncle.

1432
02:07:39,785 --> 02:07:41,696
I wanted to be like you...

1433
02:07:43,455 --> 02:07:45,264
...but could not...

1434
02:07:47,026 --> 02:07:48,835
...because I am my
father's son after all.

1435
02:07:56,802 --> 02:07:57,974
I am going HOW.

1436
02:07:59,071 --> 02:08:01,551
To submit both these recordings
to the Vigilance Bureau.

1437
02:09:14,947 --> 02:09:16,392
I knew it...

1438
02:09:16,882 --> 02:09:18,555
...you would let him kill you...

1439
02:09:18,784 --> 02:09:22,994
...because he raised you.

1440
02:09:24,857 --> 02:09:26,495
It was our father's wish...

1441
02:09:26,992 --> 02:09:29,598
...that I become neither
like this family, nor like that.

1442
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:34,236
But had I thought
of his wish today...

1443
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:37,402
...then I would have lost my kin.

1444
02:09:39,071 --> 02:09:42,348
And one's kin matters
more than one's dreams.

1445
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:18,752
Gurgaon.

1446
02:10:19,711 --> 02:10:21,088
...my father's village.

1447
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:23,050
My city.

1448
02:10:23,982 --> 02:10:27,225
The salt of his sweat
singes my wounds.

1449
02:10:28,187 --> 02:10:34,160
The colour on my hands stay

1450
02:10:34,393 --> 02:10:40,810
The deep shade of blood,
won't wash away.

1451
02:10:40,899 --> 02:10:47,009
My eyes are tearful

1452
02:10:47,306 --> 02:10:54,747
Happiness without, neither fearful

1453
02:10:57,783 --> 02:11:02,783
Beaten and broken I return home,
Aurangzeb.

1454
02:11:10,128 --> 02:11:15,128
Battled many enemies,
I lost myself more, Aurangzeb

1455
02:11:22,541 --> 02:11:29,459
Aurangzeb

1456
02:11:29,882 --> 02:11:34,882
I killed and I lived, Aurangzeb

1457
02:11:42,794 --> 02:11:49,871
I did what I did, Aurangzeb

1458
02:11:51,503 --> 02:11:54,143
This system of collection
has been in place for years.

1459
02:11:54,506 --> 02:11:55,712
The money from this system...

1460
02:11:55,774 --> 02:11:57,845
...goes all the way up
to the seniors and ministers.

1461
02:11:58,343 --> 02:12:01,950
The nexus is not going to come
to an end with just my Uncle's death.

1462
02:12:02,648 --> 02:12:06,095
The DCP said that only
two powers would survive...

1463
02:12:06,184 --> 02:12:07,629
...the politicians and the corporates.

1464
02:12:07,986 --> 02:12:10,592
But if a policeman doesn't take
bribes from any of them...

1465
02:12:10,689 --> 02:12:12,635
...then he won't fear them either.

1466
02:12:13,125 --> 02:12:15,469
This position can give
us either money or power.

1467
02:12:17,029 --> 02:12:18,599
We've seen a lot of money,

1468
02:12:20,032 --> 02:12:21,705
now it's time to show our power.

1469
02:12:28,907 --> 02:12:30,011
Vishal...

1470
02:12:31,043 --> 02:12:33,250
...come, food is ready.

1471
02:12:34,212 --> 02:12:35,486
Visha...

1472
02:12:37,482 --> 02:12:38,984
Ajay...

1473
02:12:42,521 --> 02:12:44,228
You spent so much time with me...

1474
02:12:45,924 --> 02:12:48,461
...but you never called me
to eat so lovingly.

1475
02:12:55,367 --> 02:12:57,813
You left me so many years ago...

1476
02:12:58,570 --> 02:13:02,643
...but I could not go anywhere
else after my release from prison.

1477
02:13:13,952 --> 02:13:15,727
There are no extra rooms here, right?

1478
02:13:16,388 --> 02:13:22,532
So from today you will sleep on the
couch, and I'll sleep in your room.

1479
02:13:36,975 --> 02:13:37,783
Ajay...

1480
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:39,653
Doesn't he ever smile or what?
