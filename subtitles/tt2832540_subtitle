26
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,323
No, Dolu. No. No, Dolu.

27
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,561
No. No. No. No.

28
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,632
No, Dolu. No.

29
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,434
You may kill me if you want..

30
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,330
..but don't you dare give me an electric shock.

31
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,630
Or else l'll really die.

32
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,375
lf l die,then who'll get my girls married?

33
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,139
l'm there.
Theirs and your brother.

34
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:13,383
Their uncle's son Dolu.

35
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,077
l will get them married.

36
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,316
And wherever l want.

37
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,785
So that later, you can usurp the property yourself.

38
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,156
The propertyis mine.

39
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,696
And now, you're no more my aunt.

40
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,768
lf uncle was interested in you..

41
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,302
..he would n't have got married again in ltaly.

42
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,633
And if uncle was interested in his property..

43
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:41,544
..then he would n't have given birth to two daughters,but a
son.

44
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,812
That's why l'm the owner of the entire property!

45
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,485
Brother, what do you mean?

46
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,091
When someone disowns you from his property..

47
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,784
..this is what happens.
- l see.

48
00:04:55,895 --> 00:05:01,094
And as for the girls,just say yes, aunt.
- No. No.

49
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:06,262
You will get the girls married where l ask you to.
- No.

50
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,566
Say yes, aunt.
- No.

51
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,537
l'll have to teach her a lesson.
- No.

52
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,210
Say yes, aunt. Say yes, aunt.
- No. No.

53
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,838
Say yes, aunt!
- No!

54
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,170
ls aunt made of wood?

55
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,634
Nothing happened to you.

56
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,516
You didn't get a shock?

57
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,122
Brother,the wire came off.

58
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,224
Then put it back.

59
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,417
Before l lose the property.

60
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,996
Brother, leave it loose.

61
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,434
Aunt, have mercy on us.

62
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,599
We don't have money to buy even a two feet long wire.

63
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,143
The entire property is with you.

64
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,136
Lalli, Challi.
- Yes, brother.

65
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,182
Put the wire in the plug and pull the chair two feet ahead.

66
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,819
No. No. No. No.

67
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,712
No. No.

68
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,456
You won't be able to survive now.

69
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,389
Aunt!

70
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,729
Mother.

71
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,706
Mother.
- Don'tlaugh.

72
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,475
You dreamt about Dolu again.

73
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,880
Okay,tell me something.

74
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:26,109
How did he try to kill you?

75
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,447
Did he push you from the terrace?

76
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,384
Or did he give you an electric shock?

77
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,047
Very simple.
He was about to give you an electric shock..

78
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,658
..but the lights went off at the last minute.

79
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,426
Or else you would keep sleeping.

80
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,327
Dear, you're joking?

81
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,593
l am really worried.

82
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,093
l want to get you two married quickly and send you..

83
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,966
..to your respective homes as soon as possible.

84
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,069
No. We won't leave you alone and go anywhere.

85
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,041
Or else people will say that even the daughters are like their father.

86
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,579
They left their mother alone as soon as they got married.

87
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,167
Rinki.

88
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:57,139
- Why?
Did l say anything wrong?

89
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,377
Even father left mother alone.

90
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,473
Rinki, think before you talk.

91
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:09,348
Who are you calling father?

92
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,554
The man who left our mother alone forever?

93
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,597
You're calling him your father?

94
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,633
He means nothing to us.

95
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,701
l'm sorry, mother.

96
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,399
But no matter what you say, we're not going to leave you.

97
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:30,013
Dear, daughters have to go to their in-laws' house.

98
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,981
No, mother.
We have to go.

99
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:33,966
But why should you be left alone?

100
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:34,760
Do one thing.

101
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,079
You too get married and go to your in-laws' house.

102
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,350
Okay?
- Correct.

103
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,719
Yes.
After sending you two off in your palanquin, ..

104
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,654
..l'll get into mine too.

105
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,257
What will people say?

106
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,361
Mother is has tier than her daughters.

107
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:49,959
You're crazy.

108
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,572
Love you, mother.

109
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,668
Always be happy like this, girls.

110
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:07,580
l just pray to God that you get such lovely boys..

111
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,853
..that give you all the joys in the world.

112
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,531
Darling, l..

113
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,470
l don't understand how to say this, but l'm breaking up with you.

114
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,511
l know that you felt bad.

115
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,912
But please forgive me.

116
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,711
Darling, we won't meet again after this.

117
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,357
Neither will we have coffee together, nor watch a movie together.

118
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,825
Don't even call meagain.

119
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,391
Whats the use of these romantic talks..

120
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,021
..when we can't get married eventually, darling?

121
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,003
l'm sorry. l.. l'll leave.

122
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,502
But who are you?
- That's it.

123
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,375
That's what you have to say every time we meet.

124
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,922
''Who are you?

125
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:04,626
How do you know me?''

126
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:05,964
Excuse me.

127
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,037
l don't even know you.

128
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,508
Pooja. What happened, darling?

129
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,083
Dimpy, this boy was trying to flirt with me.

130
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:12,983
You..
- One minute. One minute.

131
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:13,642
What did l say to you?

132
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,811
You spoketo me.

133
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,048
He was saying that we won't meet again.

134
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,454
We can't have coffee again.

135
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,377
Moreover, we can't get married either.

136
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,551
And..
- Don't call me.

137
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,059
Yes. Not to call him.

138
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:23,713
Look at this.

139
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:25,211
This is what we were talking about.

140
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,559
And when you came, she got scared.

141
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,428
She got scared and told you that l was flirting with her.

142
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,130
Okay, now you two don't fight.

143
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:32,029
Let by gones beby gones.
l'll leave.

144
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,196
Dimpy,this boyis lying.

145
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,501
l knew that you were having an affair with someone.

146
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,769
You have many friends on Facebook.

147
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:37,657
- At least listen to me.

148
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,671
First tell me how many boyfriends you have.

149
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:40,530
Show me your phone.

150
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,171
Dimpy, you're suspecting me because of this loafer?

151
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,180
You're talking about suspicion?

152
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,341
He was telling you not to call him..

153
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,974
..watch a movie with him or marry him..

154
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:47,460
Listen to me..

155
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,338
- You're talking about suspicion?

156
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,682
Shut up, Dimpy!

157
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,036
Hey! l will..two minutes, Pooja.

158
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,621
So, are you the girl's brothers?
- No.

159
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,033
Then why are you standing here as if you're the girl's brothers?

160
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,225
Move.

161
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,164
We're the boy's brothers.

162
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,293
Today because of you, l'll have to do that again.

163
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,116
What have l done?

164
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,755
Did you go and tell him everything?

165
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,428
l didn't tell him anything.

166
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,764
l was talking very calmly.

167
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,755
He heard everything.

168
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,910
Do you ever talk calmly?

169
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:47,887
You must have yelled!

170
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,005
l spoke calmly!

171
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:50,626
Do l ever talk loudly?

172
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,512
What are you doing right now?

173
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:52,225
You're talking loudly!

174
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,834
You..

175
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,864
Don't call me again.

176
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,793
- Why should n't l?

177
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:57,167
Why should n't l ?
Tell me.

178
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,375
ls it? ls it?
- Yes.

179
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,225
Don't touch my bike.

180
00:11:59,251 --> 00:11:59,772
- Here you go.

181
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:00,728
 l touched it. Tell me.

182
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:01,684
Sit on the bike and show me.

183
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,529
- Here you go.
l'll sit.

184
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,031
Here you go.

185
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,454
You sat.
Now don't start it.

186
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,488
What's the big deal about starting it?

187
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:08,949
l started it. Now tell me.

188
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,028
Let's run now!

189
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,564
Brother,they left.

190
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,828
Brother,they fooled you.

191
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,527
Fools! What are you waiting for?
Catch them!

192
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,363
Let's go! Let's go!
- Sit quickly!

193
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,605
Let's go quickly!

194
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:24,093
Half of you go there.

195
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,072
Go quickly, they should not escape.

196
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,138
We have escaped from there.

197
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,371
But we've gate-crashed this wedding.

198
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,378
We won't be able to escape from here.

199
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,846
Stay in control.

200
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,310
Don't drink.

201
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,413
You know that we go out of control after we drink.

202
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,954
We're uninvited here.

203
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,985
l just want to eat.

204
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,854
Yes. Then do onething.
You eat.

205
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,824
l'll be right back.
- Okay.

206
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,322
Don't drink.
- l've stopped drinking.

207
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,596
Hello, aunt.

208
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,336
The guy cameout from there.

209
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:41,881
Hello.

210
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,297
Girls do this..

211
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,981
- Who's speaking?

212
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,422
Fall in love with one and marry another.

213
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:49,009
- l'll call you later.
Later.

214
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,593
l am going to present this famous song.

215
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,188
Mani? Oh gosh!

216
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:10,104
''He will take you crying..''

217
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,014
''..in a car..''

218
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,609
..decorated with ribbons.''

219
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,087
Comedown!
Comedown!

220
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,751
One minute. One minute.

221
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,586
Say whatever you want to me.

222
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,196
But don't say anything to my brother.

223
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,525
You have abrot her too?

224
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,361
Yes.
Do whatever you want!

225
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,059
He's the one in the red jacket.

226
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,102
Don't you dare hit him!

227
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:34,661
No one will say anything to him!

228
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,299
What's going on?

229
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,603
Nimmi, you?

230
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,916
l had told you not to drink.

231
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:48,539
You messed up everything.

232
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,220
Did you know the girl?
- No.

233
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,014
Then why did you say, ''Nimmi, you?''

234
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,117
l thought that we were going to be beaten anyway.

235
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,388
Let the excuse be big enough.

236
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,885
You're a scoundrel.

237
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,080
- You think you're alone?

238
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,598
See where we are because of your Nimmi.

239
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:05,291
- Don't worry, son.

240
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,368
l still have to bring your father here.

241
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,296
Are you sure?

242
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:10,429
Don't back out later.

243
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,368
Sure? Set in stone.

244
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,773
Father is done for today.

245
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,768
Now itll be fun.

246
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,694
How does the dress look?

247
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,978
Doesn't it look pretty?.

248
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,022
Parminder Singh Pappihora has made this dress himself.

249
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,160
Using his personal brain.

250
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,526
While making this dress..

251
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,394
l kept in mind the two important weaknesses of women.

252
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,660
Do you know the two weaknesses of women?

253
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,371
One is to bargain and the other is to be praised.

254
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,939
This has both the qualities.

255
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,838
lts price is low and it will be praised as well.

256
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,237
Moreover, you know that ladies rarely repeat their dresses.

257
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,338
l remember, in our neighborhood during ..

258
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,040
..a mourning ceremony, a woman didn't go..

259
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,618
..only because she didn't have a white dress.

260
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,887
Her husband said, ''You have a white dress.''

261
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,013
''Why don't you wear it and go?''

262
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,088
She said, ''l know that l have a white dress..''

263
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,284
''..but l wore it for your mother's funeral.''

264
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,189
''lf l wear that dress and go again..''

265
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,524
''..then people will say that she is wearing the same dress again.''

266
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,297
''She is not at all concerned about the dead person.''

267
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:12,595
So, that's why, for death occasions we have prepared cheap dresses.

268
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,002
Use and throw.

269
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,539
That way, our brand will become popular too.

270
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,166
For your information, let me tell you that..

271
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:22,611
..we're opening four more showrooms in big cities of lndia.

272
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,706
And we are opening a showroom in Dubai too.

273
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,876
We'll send all our rejected goods over there.

274
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,248
People send new and good stuff.

275
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,411
Why are you sending rejected stuff?.

276
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,284
What's the use of sending good stuFF?.

277
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,290
People are going to wear it under their burqa anyway.

278
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,458
Actually, brother, customers always come..

279
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,460
..to a shop with a good reputation.

280
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:43,861
And you very well know what our reputation and name is in the market.

281
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,829
Mr. Parminder, the SHO has called you to the police station.

282
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,964
What have the idiots done today?

283
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,200
You go ahead. l'll be there.

284
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,006
No. lt's his order to bring you along.

285
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,942
The SHO is very fond ofme.

286
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,107
When l don't go to meet him, hesends his men.

287
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,810
l said l am coming, you go ahead.

288
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,409
Don't you understand polite language?

289
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,019
He won't agree!
Take him!

290
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,383
What is the use of this love in which people come ..

291
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,550
..to take you by force?

292
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,394
Comeon!

293
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:08,689
Comeon!

294
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,787
Your love is amazing.

295
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,892
l'm sorry, Mr. Parminder, but this is how l express my love.

296
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,161
Hello, father.
When did you come?

297
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,261
Getlost.

298
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,706
l wonder what you're punishing me for.

299
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,263
l have two sons.

300
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:27,499
Both are useless.

301
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,114
People tell me that l'm ill-fated.

302
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,181
What's my fate's fault?

303
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,250
They are useless.

304
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,646
Father, don't get angry.

305
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,845
When we see your angry face, we feel like laughing.

306
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:36,551
Come home!

307
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,607
Just see what l do to you today!

308
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,520
Father, you're talking as if we've done this for the first time.

309
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,293
ls this right?

310
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,380
You're insulting us in front of a respectable man.

311
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,123
Who did you call are respectable man?
- Him.

312
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,698
Now you will praise him too?

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,830
l won't spare you today!

314
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:49,754
l won't spare you today!

315
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,482
Stop it, Mr. Parminder.

316
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:53,192
You can't break the law.

317
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,237
You're talking of breaking the law?

318
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,170
l feel like tearing it into pieces.

319
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,673
The law?
- You two!

320
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,371
Mr. Parminder, you rich people learn to make money..

321
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,080
..but forget to bring up your children.

322
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,525
You're absolutely right, constable!

323
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:05,334
- Hey! Say lnspector!

324
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,044
lt's the same thing, uncle.

325
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,349
Uncle,when we were kids, we never saw our father in the house.

326
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,151
When we saw our father for the first time..

327
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,724
..he had slightly grayish beard.

328
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,089
We never got to see a young father.

329
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,321
He was never at home.

330
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,420
We wanted to call someone our father.

331
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,659
So we would address the peon in our school as 'father' and run away.

332
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,359
To hell with you!

333
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,235
Your mother died accusing me ofthis!

334
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,634
''l didn't get true love!''

335
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,299
Someone ask her that if she didn't get true love..

336
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,741
..then have l downloaded these two idiots from Google?

337
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,578
Mr. Parminder..

338
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,616
l don't know whether you've downloaded them or uploaded them.

339
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,479
lf you've given birth to them, then you must nurture them.

340
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,482
l won't interfere in your internet.

341
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,553
Sign these papers.

342
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,452
l won't sign these papers.

343
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,582
Make me sign papers to disown them.

344
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,025
Sign the disowning papers in court.

345
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:50,924
First come here and sign.

346
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,825
This is force!

347
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,604
This is not force.

348
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,014
We're asking you to do it lovingly.

349
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,260
Look, don't force me or push me.

350
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,629
l've told you many times before.

351
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,633
l havea problem.

352
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,000
That's why we're lifting you.
Carry him!

353
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,765
Take this. Hold it.

354
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,192
- What are you doing?

355
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,468
Over here.
- ls this how you make a person do something?

356
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,247
Very good.

357
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,613
Thank you, father.
Thank you.

358
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,686
Your 'thank you' seems like poison to me.

359
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,731
Even then, father, l love you.

360
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:18,742
- Even l love you, two,three, four.

361
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,046
Get lost!

362
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,023
Mr. Parminder, you won't find such children anywhere.

363
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,221
They say 'l love you' and ' thank you' for everything.

364
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,695
You don't know, Mr. Sher Singh.

365
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,063
When they say 'thank you' and 'l love you' to me, they cheat me.

366
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,069
The samething happened.

367
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,902
They took my wallet and the car keys as well.

368
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,303
l reached home like a donkey.

369
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,577
They broke my body!

370
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,314
Massage my legs, don't break them.

371
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,586
Do you want to get me drunk?
Get lost!

372
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,893
Sir, you scold me as if l'm your son.

373
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,059
lf you were my son, l would have thrashed you.

374
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,334
''l would have thrashed you.''

375
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,463
lf you had thrashed them at the right time..

376
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,201
..then this wouldn't have been the situation.

377
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,708
Go and see if there's ice in the fridge.

378
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:13,584
He can't do anything to his sons.

379
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,064
He just rebukes me.

380
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:14,941
Khadak Singh.

381
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,949
Where do you think l made a mistake?

382
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:23,283
Since childhood,l provided them with everything that l could.

383
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,691
When they asked for a scooter, l bought them a cycle.

384
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,220
Why are you staring at me?

385
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,123
Would l have bought a plane for a 7-year-old?

386
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,696
l never differentiated between them.

387
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,563
l treated both of them equally.

388
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,892
When it was one's fault, l punished both of them.

389
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,266
People give their children polio drops for the first five years.

390
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,134
l gave the younger one for seven years ..

391
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,468
..and the elder one for 11 years..

392
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,440
..thinking that they should not become handicapped.

393
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,406
Tell me.
Where did l lack?

394
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,028
You tell me.

395
00:20:48,054 --> 00:20:49,903
You take mangoes from Gauhati to Kolkata.

396
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,004
You have seen the world.

397
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,107
l have not seen the world.

398
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,415
l've only seen roads all my life.

399
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,352
Once my truck met with an accident, people picked me up later..

400
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,622
..first they picked up the mangoes.

401
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,524
This is how the world is.

402
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:07,463
Still, since you've asked me, l'll give you an advice.

403
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,169
Your sons are spoilt because they didn't get a mother's love.

404
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,761
l didn't get a wife's love.

405
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:13,559
Am l spoilt?

406
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,571
lt's been 17 years since my wife died.

407
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,170
l spent my time talking to her photo.

408
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,207
You didn't understand.

409
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:27,774
lf you want to save this family, then you need a woman in this house.

410
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,980
You have a point.

411
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,160
But who do l pick up and bring?

412
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,623
No, no.
Don't pick up anyone.

413
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:40,848
We will bring her by car.

414
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,025
l guarantee you that..

415
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:48,403
..the boys will come to their senses after the marriage.

416
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,868
l think you're too drunk.

417
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,037
What kind of non sensical suggestions are you giving me?

418
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,675
lt's not nonsensical.

419
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:57,607
l'm giving you the right suggestion.

420
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:01,483
A house without a woman is like a pyjama without elastic.

421
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,179
The pyjama was under the impression all..

422
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,916
..its life that it clothes people.

423
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,117
Actually, it's all due to the elastic.

424
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:09,864
Listen to me.

425
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,112
Marry someone as soon as possible.

426
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,926
lf the boys still don't come to their senses,..

427
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,465
..then l'll change my name.

428
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,232
Hello, Mrs. Pappi.

429
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,360
l love you a lot.

430
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,534
l won't talk to you.

431
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,144
Why did you leave me?

432
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,609
lf you were here today..

433
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,818
..then l wouldn't have had to listen to Khadak Singh's nonsense.

434
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,583
Did you hear what he said?

435
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:41,656
You didn't?

436
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,725
But l had heard that walls have ears.

437
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,071
What's the matter?

438
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:46,754
Are you deaf?.

439
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,999
He was telling me to get married.

440
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,199
You tell me.

441
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:53,986
Can anyone take your place?

442
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,731
No, right?

443
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,170
And how will the boys improve if I get married?

444
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,670
He says they're spoilt because they didn't get their mother's love.

445
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,374
Fine, let's assume that l bring home a new wife.

446
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,543
Don't mind. l'm just supposing.

447
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,154
lf they don't get motherly love from her either..

448
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,185
..then they'll beather to death.

449
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,690
l'll go crazy talking to two photos.

450
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,585
Forget it.
Why should we waste time?

451
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,608
Buddy, the documents of the car are in father's name.

452
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,646
We can sell our father without documents.

453
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,144
The car is not a big deal.

454
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,349
Yes.

455
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:45,960
l'm Speedy Singh.

456
00:23:45,986 --> 00:23:48,515
The king of cars, Speedy Singh.

457
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,185
l can see the indicator of amoving..

458
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,592
..car and guess which way the car will go.

459
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,090
l think he ate a lot of almonds when he was growing up.

460
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,525
By the way, brother, that's great.

461
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:57,896
Very few people have such knowledge.

462
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,903
Due to this knowledge, l never face losses in life.

463
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,371
l don't know about losses, but one thing is for sure.

464
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,442
You must haven ever eaten less.

465
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,737
Naughty boy!

466
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,604
Okay, brother.
So,tell me what you'll pay for the car.

467
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:09,509
But don't quote less.

468
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,941
lt seems to be worth 10 lakhs.

469
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:11,800
l'll quote 6 lakhs.

470
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:12,979
6 lakhs.

471
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:14,784
Giveme.

472
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,377
They agreed so soon?

473
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:18,887
lt's yours, isn't it?

474
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,618
You're strange.
lt's our car.

475
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,520
Firstly, if you need to go somewhere, you have to take a rickshaw.

476
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,992
Thats the problem with small towns.

477
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,001
Look,we're helpless to sell this car at such a low price.

478
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,205
Do you know how many memories of our friends are attached to this car?

479
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,467
Some inside and some outside.

480
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,042
The memories won't increase the value of the car.

481
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,810
You're going to get the same amount.

482
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:44,438
By the way, you two don't look that helpless.

483
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,775
Do we have to grow a beard to look helpless?

484
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,077
Do we have to wear torn clothes to show that we're helpless?

485
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,916
We have to repay our father's loans..

486
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,650
..that he had borrowed drinking expensive liquor.

487
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,483
He does not drink cheap liquor.

488
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,052
That's how everyone's fathers are.

489
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,924
My father thinks l'm useless.

490
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,226
Hes ays l don't know to deal with cars.

491
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,197
He's right.

492
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,117
Look, don't make us emotional.

493
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:06,157
Give us the money.

494
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,601
You think only you can do a drama?
l can't?

495
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,002
Give me the documents first.

496
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,472
Go and take the documents from father.

497
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,804
Then your father will get the money too.

498
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,003
All right,then.
Father will make the deal himself.

499
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,642
Lets go, then.
- Yes. Let's go.

500
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,209
2 lakhs.

501
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,953
l've never let anyone go empty-handed from my shop.

502
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,786
ls this your shop or aunt's house?

503
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,392
''l never let anyone go empty-handed.''

504
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,625
By the way, you shouldn't go empty-handed from your aunt's house.

505
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,225
lt's our right. Let's go.
- Come.

506
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,605
Father says that l can't make deals.

507
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,232
l bought a car worth 10 lakhs in 6 lakhs.
Yes!

508
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,071
Hey! Don't look at the girl likethat.

509
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,317
What can l do?

510
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:19,528
l've never seen a beautiful girl from so close.

511
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:23,636
l feel like being with her for six and three fourth life times.

512
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,339
Six and three fourth life times?

513
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,308
One fourth life is gone like this..

514
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:28,418
lt not called that.

515
00:26:28,444 --> 00:26:29,574
You are also like an Englishman.

516
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,280
What do they call it in Punjabi?
Quarter.

517
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,622
You know everything, don't you?

518
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,688
Tell me how l should propose to her.

519
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,424
What? What?
Tell me again.

520
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,706
Don't act so arrogant.

521
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:39,283
l need your help this time.

522
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,147
You know, l can't live without her.

523
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:42,456
l've fallen in love with her.

524
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,194
How can you fall in love so soon?

525
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,735
The minute you saw the girl..

526
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,534
lt happened.
- What?. - Love.

527
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,409
You're not helping your brother.

528
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:54,432
You're just wasting time.

529
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,718
No, it's not that.

530
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:58,803
l want to spend an entire life time with her.

531
00:26:58,883 --> 00:26:59,645
Just one life time?

532
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:03,619
You see, l feel like l've already lived my last six life times.

533
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,087
Now l want to live my one pending life time.
Hold this.

534
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,323
l'll be right back.

535
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,025
Excuseme, madam.
l need your help.

536
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,497
Please tell me where l can find things to commit suicide.

537
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,564
To commit suicide?

538
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,859
Do onething. From here..
But one second.

539
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:20,253
What will you do with it?

540
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,637
Look, it's simple.
l like you.

541
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,369
Now l'll propose to you and you'll refuse.

542
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,671
Then what's the use of living, madam?
l must die.

543
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,344
Excuse me.

544
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,181
l don't understand which CD of songs to listen to.

545
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,481
One is of happy songs and the other is of sad songs.

546
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,089
l don't know.
You decide.

547
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,154
l want to know your choice.

548
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,652
How can l tell you?

549
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,455
lt's simple.
l'm going to propose to you.

550
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,723
lf you say yes, then l'll listen to happy songs.

551
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,000
lf you say no,then sad.

552
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:53,394
By the way, l don't see any reason why you would reject me.

553
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,665
Look, l'm handsome.

554
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:56,633
l've worn good clothes.

555
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:57,663
l belong to a good family.

556
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,210
l'm punctual. l'm loyal too.

557
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:01,975
What do you think?

558
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,029
Will it work out?

559
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,475
Vicky.

560
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,514
Why are you following me with these excuses?

561
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,603
l'm not Vicky.

562
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:10,713
- Don't pretend to be innocent.

563
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,987
When we've already filed for divorce,
why are you after me?

564
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:15,791
What divorce?

565
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:17,211
You're misunderstanding.

566
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,024
Remember, after our divorce..

567
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,132
..Pinkywill be with me and Pappu will be with you.

568
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,763
Keep both of them.
l'm going.

569
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,361
Okay!

570
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,104
Keep sending money every month!

571
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,502
My father doesn't give me money even in a year.

572
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,303
How can l give you money every month?

573
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,237
You know what?

574
00:28:34,263 --> 00:28:37,071
l think you should commit suicide.

575
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,547
That's better. Right?

576
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,151
Bye.

577
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,953
lt didn't work out, did it?

578
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,821
No, no.
Girls wearing green pants don't agree easily.

579
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,427
What logic is that?

580
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,561
That girl was nice.

581
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:53,214
Nice girls don't agree easily.

582
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,657
Now she'll think about me.

583
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:56,416
She'll listen to romantic songs.

584
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,297
Then she'll realizeand then she'll come to me.

585
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,865
You mean to say that this was the right way to propose?

586
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:01,606
Yes, absolutely.

587
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:02,300
Yes, absolutely.

588
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:26,691
When l told him to commit suicide..

589
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,556
When l told him to commit suicide..

590
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:32,060
..the way he disappeared like how
the network is lost suddenly!

591
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:36,163
By the way, madam, a person could
lose his network on seeing you.

592
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,098
You're talking about mobile network.

593
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,170
l think you didn't find the things to commit suicide.

594
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,274
No, l found the things, madam,
but l didn't feel like spending money.

595
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,774
l need to send money to someone every month.

596
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,172
Vicky.

597
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,904
She takes my name with so much love, isn't it?

598
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,036
With alot of love.

599
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,615
Excuse me, please.

600
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,140
When are we going to meet again?

601
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,382
Bye. Bye.

602
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,552
Wonderful.

603
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,518
At least give me your address.

604
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,123
Give my love to Pinky and Pappu.

605
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,229
ls she married?

606
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,222
lt's our personal matter.

607
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,026
We'll teach these lovers a lesson today.

608
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,434
Back off!

609
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,931
Hey!
Why did you push?

610
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,002
l felt like pushing, so l pushed.

611
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,806
l felt like punching, so l punched.

612
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,612
Atleast find out first if the person has a stone.

613
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,996
Never mind.
lt must be broken.

614
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:26,971
lt will come out soon.

615
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,348
Now it will come sooner.

616
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,784
l don't want to build a road.

617
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,018
Giveme.
- Giveme.

618
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,450
l won't give this.
- Why?.

619
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,185
lt comes to use during difficult times.

620
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,850
Take it from me during difficult times.

621
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:38,660
Brother, comehere.

622
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,222
Come here, brother. Come here.
- Go.

623
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,200
You look good.

624
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,734
lt's my sister's wedding next month.

625
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,865
So, have you come here to buy vegetables?

626
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,065
Brother, come here.

627
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,133
Brother, don't hit me here.

628
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,426
l have a boil here.
- Okay.

629
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:55,601
Here you go.

630
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,014
lt broke!

631
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,914
Your tooth?
- No, the boil!

632
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,520
So,what do we do?

633
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,184
Should we build the road for you?

634
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,557
Brother,they served us very well.

635
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,665
What do you mean they served us?

636
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,372
They broke our bones.

637
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,441
Here's your stick.

638
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:26,798
lt will come to use during difficult times.

639
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,905
Brother,the stick got us in trouble.

640
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,306
By the way,tell me something.

641
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,313
You got beat up, but who are you?

642
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,286
The real cousin of those girls.

643
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:42,910
Their uncle's son Dolu.

644
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:46,724
Oh, no. Gani, we hit our relative.

645
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,759
Never mind.
l'll greet you during your weddings.

646
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,264
Mani, let's go.
- We should.

647
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,511
Take me to the hospital.

648
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,740
l feel suffocated.

649
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,147
Brother,they will give us glucose.

650
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,378
Rascals, wonder what all they will give us.

651
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,729
Hello. Are you Mr. Parminder?

652
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,699
Tell me.
What brings you here?

653
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,030
l've cometo take the documents.

654
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,064
Normally we hear offemale rag-pickers in the streets

655
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,335
This is the first time l have heard of a male rag-picker.

656
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,600
You look colorful.

657
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:34,997
You pick up colorful papers?

658
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,274
No, l've come to take the documents of your car.

659
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,178
Are you a traffic policeman?

660
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,651
Your sons sold your car to me.

661
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:42,687
How did they sell it?

662
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:43,870
ls it their father's car?

663
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:44,421
Yes.

664
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,250
They said that it's their father's.

665
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,348
Okay,then, take the documents from their father.
l won't give you.

666
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,483
Why won't you give me?

667
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,089
We've finalized a deal for 6 lakhs.

668
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,087
They've taken 2 lakhs.

669
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:52,818
Here are 4 lakhs.

670
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:53,839
Give me the documents.

671
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:54,844
You've already lost 2 lakhs.

672
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,289
Now do you want to lose 4 lakhs as well?

673
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,659
Be a good boy and give me my key back.

674
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,144
You won't get this key.

675
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,088

676
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,534

What's the matter?

681

The morning winding is over?

682
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:11,942
That you are asking for it again.

683
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,540
My father is going to beat me when ..

684
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:14,844
..he comes back from the religious place.

685
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,749
Son, when a person comes from a religious place..

686
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,481
..and gives you something it's not called beating.

687
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,246
lts called offerings.
Eat it.

688
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,017
lt's my first deal.

689
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,287
lf l fail, my father is going to hit me a lot.

690
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,896
Then you haven't experienced your uncle's beating yet.

691
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,662
Uncle, give me the key.

692
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:28,756

Here, son.
Take the key and the car as well.

704
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,588
Don't go empty-handed from your uncle's house.

705
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:49,240
- Don't shoot me!

706
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,947
Move! l'll be shot!

707
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,684
lf you try to get into my house again, l'll kill you!

708
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,555
Hey!
What are you doing here?

709
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,624
Nothing, uncle.
We've just come from out. Father..

710
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,032
Then we thought of hiding for a while.

711
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,692
Son, is anything hidden from your parents?

712
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:06,792
Softly, uncle. Softly.

713
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,131
What do you mean?

714
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,437
Khadak Singh, are you talking to the bushes?

715
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,138
Yes. Yes.

716
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,938
Yes. l talk to the bushes sometimes.

717
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,276
ls it? Are you friends with them?

718
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,048
lf you are,then ask them when they will flower.

719
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,845
And also ask if it's male or female.

720
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,887
Because sometimes when l am drunk, l pee in front of them.

721
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,354
What are you talking?

722
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,049
As if you're talking sense.

723
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,454
You're talking to the bushes..

724
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,186
You scoundrels!
l won't spare you today!

725
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,198
l won't spare you today!
l won't spare you today!

726
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,165
Move! Move!

727
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,660
Move!

728
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,299
l'll kill you today!

729
00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:42,860
- Have you gone crazy?.

730
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,637
Uncle, saveus!

731
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,212
Uncle, saveus!

732
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,364
Please don't shoot!
Please don't shoot!

733
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,400
l'm very scared of guns!

734
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,041
l never had medicine even when l had a headache.

735
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,312
l just hit my head and bear it.

736
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,387
l don't want to waste my bullet on you..

737
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,285
.. because you are a useless fellow.

738
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:05,460
One minute!
Before shooting me, you'll have to shoot my brother!

739
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,460
To hell with you!

740
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,096
Father! Father, don't shoot me!

741
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,359
Before shooting me, you'll have to go over your dead body.

742
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,595
Father.
- Buddy, l will not let you die.

743
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,898
You are my friend.

744
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,700
Don't shoot, father.
We will die.

745
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:17,318
Don't worry.

746
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:18,663
You won't die if l shoot you.

747
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,233
Because l'm going to hit you like this!

748
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,278
l'm going to hit you like this!

749
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:27,146
Move!
- Father!

750
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,926
The girls didn't agree to give their pictures.

751
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,766
l've found this family photo of ours.

752
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,901
You can keep this.
- lt's okay.

753
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,096
We don't have to get their passports made.

754
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,465
We have to look for boys for them.

755
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,139
Find good boys.

756
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,743
Sure, sister.

757
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,281
l have two sons.

758
00:37:01,307 --> 00:37:02,806
Both are useless.

759
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:04,652
People say that l'm ill-fated.

760
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,935
What's my fate's fault?

761
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:06,907
They are useless.

762
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,961
Pappi, you know what l think?

763
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:14,129
l'm quite drunk.
l must leave now.

764
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,491
Did you come here to finish my liquor?

765
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:17,657
Give me a solution.

766
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:18,812
Today they sold the car.

767
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:20,094
Tomorrow they might sell my showroom..

768
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:20,966
..and the day after, they might sell me.

769
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:26,975
Listen.
The chicken was tasty, but the salt was less.

770
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,109
The chicken was suffering from high blood pressure.

771
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,612
That's why l added less salt.

772
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,978
Tell me a solution to bring those idiots to their senses.

773
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,518
l can tell you a solution only if you listen to me.

774
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,821
l had told you.

775
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:41,606
Marriage is the solution to all the problems.

776
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,157
Who would ge this daughter married into..

777
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,556
..the house where such idiots live?

778
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,686
So what if your sons are idiots?

779
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,856
You'rea rich man.

780
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,696
You get married.

781
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,037
But Khadak Singh, what will people think?

782
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,769
ls this the age to get married?

783
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,533
Why do you care about the people?

784
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,740
This is the age to get married.

785
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,013
Just think.
After marriage,when the boys will get to eat the food..

786
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:09,084
..cooked by a woman and not by a servant..

787
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,177
..they'll change by themselves.

788
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,861
Will only the boys get all the benefits?

789
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:13,475
What about me?

790
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,870
You will benefit.

791
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:15,948
You will,too.

792
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:21,464
Look, you can get the new dresses..

793
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,528
..of your showroom tried at home itself.

794
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:29,069
How long will you put the dresses on mannequins and try?

795
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,474
You have a point.

796
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,745
Okay.
lf you insist, l'll do it for the sake of my children.

797
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,443
That's like it.

798
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,449
Look, l have a friend, Goga.

799
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,179
He is a matchmaker.

800
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,085
He'll get you photographs of girls.

801
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,658
You can see the photographs and decide.

802
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,954
But tell Goga that the girl should belong to a reputed family.

803
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,562
Absolutely.

804
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,757
Do onething.
Make arrangements for the wedding.

805
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:59,029
After the wedding, just watch how everything changes in the house.

806
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,468
ls the marriage proposal from a town planner?

807
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,300
Don't joke.

808
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,210
Father is planning to get us married.

809
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,806
Yes. We just fell in love today and
he's planning to get us married.

810
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,584
Let's go and tell him that we're in love with someone.

811
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,184
ls he going to listen to us?

812
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,389
l wonder why grandma gave birth to him.

813
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,918
ls he going to believe that we can fall in love with someone?

814
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,518
We can't love father, but we can love girls.

815
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:26,789
They don't have moustaches.

816
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,759
He'll agree.
- But how?

817
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,232
What will we tell him about the girls?

818
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,235
We don't even know their names or addresses.

819
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,629
We'll find that out.

820
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,225
Let's do one thing.

821
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:38,492
Let's forbid him from looking for girls for now.

822
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,338
Father!

823
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,882
lf you wish for your well being, then get out of my sight.

824
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,180
Don't always be angry at us.

825
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:49,000
Listen to us with a cool head sometimes.

826
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:53,216
Seeing your behavior, l think even my corpse won't be cold.

827
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,685
That will be hot too.

828
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,119
Tell me, what nonsense do you want to talk about?

829
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,522
Father, l feel like laughing seeing you angry.
- Shutup!

830
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,965
What you're about to do is not right.

831
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,292
Can't a person go to the bathroom?

832
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,234
Look, you may go to the bathroom..

833
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,930
..if you want, but don't ruin our lives.

834
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:09,732
What do you mean?

835
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:14,174
l mean,we heard what you were saying to uncle Khadak inside.

836
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,613
We don't like the idea of marriage.

837
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,361
We don't accept it.

838
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:17,810
Absolutely.
We don't!

839
00:40:17,836 --> 00:40:19,134
We don't! We don't!

840
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,879
A wedding is not happening here that you're saying
''We don't''.

841
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,419
Father,that is ''We do.

842
00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:25,378
We do. Wedo.''

843
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,831
Whatever it is, but l do.

844
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:29,281
l will do it.

845
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,720
Let's see how you do it.

846
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:32,445
lt concerns our lives.
- Yes.

847
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,131
l'm saying this for your lives.

848
00:40:34,157 --> 00:40:35,456
l mean, for your welfare.

849
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,966
We don't want your welfare.

850
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,193
And tell me something.

851
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,599
How can you go ahead with the marriage without asking us?

852
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,934
Don't make this mistake, father.

853
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,473
Yes, l won't.

854
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:48,003
Because l've already made two mistakes in life.

855
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,239
One small and the other big.

856
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,245
But l'm younger.

857
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,908
You're certainly younger, but you're a very big mistake.

858
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:54,746
Get lost!

859
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,001
How can we get lost?

860
00:40:56,027 --> 00:40:57,175
End the topic first.

861
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,880
Fine. Let's end it.

862
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,120
l'm the owner of this house, and everything in this house..

863
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,787
..will happen as Parminder Singh Tiwana wants.

864
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,728
Goga is bringing the photographs of girls tomorrow.

865
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,660
This marriage will take place.

866
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,060
Now go to your bed.

867
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,381
No, no, no. Brother.

868
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:15,920
Brother. No, he's our father.

869
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,371
l never said he's our brother-in-law.

870
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:21,343
Listen.
We can't do anything to our father.

871
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:26,079
But we can teach Goga a lesson.
- Yes.

872
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,124
Excuse me!

873
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,825
Yes?
Tell me, where do you want to go?

874
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:46,825
ls Mr. Tiwana at home?

875
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:48,194
- Yes, he is.
Who are you?

876
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,774
l'm Goga.

877
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,774
Oh!
- Goga!

878
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,938
Please come.

879
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,110
Actually, Mr. Khadak Singh has sent me.
- Oh.

880
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,845
l've brought marriage proposals for Mr. Tiwana's sons.
Yes.

881
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,652
Marriage proposals?
- Yes.

882
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,849
For his sons?
- Yes.

883
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:13,393
Brother, fearing his sons, no one comes to this area.

884
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:14,623
And you've brought marriage proposals for them.

885
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,365
What's the matter?

886
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:16,189
Are the boys not good?

887
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,916
No, no. lt's not that, brother.

888
00:42:17,942 --> 00:42:19,192
The elder son is good.

889
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,597
But he has already been married four times.
- Four times?

890
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,037
He was helpless.

891
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,203
The first wife consumed poison and died.
- l see.

892
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,709
The second wife consumed poison and died too.
- ls it?

893
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,005
The third wife consumed poison and died too.
- ls it?

894
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,135
The fourth wife died due to a head injury.

895
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,306
Why was the fourth one so different?

896
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,383
She wasn't ready to consume poison.

897
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,281
So the boy hit her on the head and killed her.

898
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:36,977
The elder one is very ruthless.

899
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,419
Brother, the younger one is even worse.

900
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,549
He didn't get married yet.

901
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,159
Who ever gets a marriage proposal for him..

902
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,989
..he puts a screwdriver in his eyes.

903
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,429
A screwdriver in the eyes!

904
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,690
Moreover, once he didn't like the moustache of the person..

905
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,358
..who brought a marriage proposal for him.

906
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,903
He pulled his upper lip alongwith the moustache.

907
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,534
The poor man can't even whistle now.
lt leaks.

908
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,169
The poor man keeps his finger on his upper lip now.

909
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,976
But how do you know these details about them?

910
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:11,852
How do we know?

911
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,358
Because heis the elder son.

912
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,826
And the younger one, who was even worse, is him.

913
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,762
l don't want to bring any marriage proposals here.

914
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,631
l'm going!
- At least have tea.

915
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,274
Run! Run!

916
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,543
Doesn't this photo look similar?

917
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,348
Not 'similar'. lt's 'familiar'.

918
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,855
She's the one you like.

919
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,720
This is the one you like.

920
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,728
Uncle Goga!
- Uncle Goga!

921
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,696
Stop! Stop!
- Stop, uncle Goga!

922
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,392
No, no. Enough.
Enough.

923
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,695
Did you bring the marriage proposal of these girls?

924
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,085
No, no.
Who told you that?

925
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:01,455
l had come just like that.

926
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,568
l wonder how this photo fell from my diary.

927
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:04,809
Uncle,why do you get angry?.

928
00:44:04,835 --> 00:44:05,700
We were just joking.

929
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,800
Right, Mani.
- Yes. We're very humorous.

930
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,538
We joke around with everyone.

931
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,810
l feel like you're joking with me now.

932
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,407
No, no. We're very serious right now.
- ls it? - See.

933
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,979
Father!

934
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,283
What?
You accept this alliance?

935
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:22,984
Yes, father.
We accept it.

936
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,594
This means you agree?
- Yes.

937
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:26,920
This means you have no problem with this marriage.

938
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:30,727
We've understood that we must not refuse our elders.

939
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:34,371
This means you've just learnt of it.

940
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,196
What?.
- That a father is elder to his son.

941
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,271
Until now, you've treated your father like your cousin.

942
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,367
By the way, father, you've kept your honor intact by saying that..

943
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,809
..because we thought of you even lower than that.

944
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,675
lf you consider me that young,then carry me.

945
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,214
Father, don't joke about everything.

946
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,817
Just give him the money.
- Money?.

947
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:48,755
Don't call it money.

948
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:50,467
What do they call itin Punjabi?
Advance.

949
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:51,258
Advance for what?

950
00:44:51,284 --> 00:44:52,546
Am l booking a singing artist?

951
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:53,854
Father, look, you're getting angry again.

952
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,478
l'll start laughing.

953
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,183
Don't change the topic.

954
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,554
Why don't you show him the photo?

955
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,560
What's the need to show father
the photo when we like her already?

956
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,079
So what if you like her?

957
00:45:01,105 --> 00:45:02,486
My choice matters too.

958
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,995
Come on, show him the photo quickly.

959
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:04,955
- Let's get it over with.

960
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:06,120
Show me now.

961
00:45:06,146 --> 00:45:07,356
They've been requesting you.

962
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:08,583
Look at this.

963
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:11,132
Dilraj Kaur's family is very nice.

964
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,607
These are her two daughters, Rinky and Minky.

965
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:14,836
Look at this.

966
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,124
Give me your photos, boys.

967
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,108
Did you see?

968
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,946
l told you that they would agree as soon as they see the photos.

969
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,879
The samething happened over there as well.

970
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:56,383
Thank God.

971
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,914
My girls liked the boys.

972
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,353
lt's a yes from us.

973
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,459
You had to agree.

974
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,773
l'll do one thing.

975
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:05,879
l'll send the boys tomorrow itself.

976
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,996
Okay, l'll leave.
Bye.

977
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,861
Okay, then, let's make arrangements for tomorrow.

978
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:45,683
Mrs. Pappi, you must be thinking that l'm very happy.

979
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,020
Yes, l'm very happy, but just from outside.

980
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,051
l've worn these colorful clothes only from outside.

981
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,991
l've still worn that white vest and am sad from within.

982
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,868
l'm not going for my sake.

983
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,898
l'm going to finalize a mother for your children.

984
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:06,039
lt's a yes from my end, if l have your permission.

985
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,108
What did you say?

986
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,971
Thank you.
You agreed so soon.

987
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,951
Why wouldn't you agree?

988
00:49:13,977 --> 00:49:15,239
You're a mother, after all.

989
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:17,650
Okay, l'll leave.

990
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:22,349
lt's a benefit to have your wife in a photo frame.

991
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,822
You can tell her whatever you feel like.

992
00:49:23,848 --> 00:49:24,645
She won't say anything.

993
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,243
Hello, father.

994
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,270
Give me your blessings, father.

995
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:46,303
Don't make me laugh early in the morning.

996
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:47,564
l'm quite serious now.

997
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:49,712
What seriousness is that?

998
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,412
Strange.. we are touching your feet.

999
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,723
Looks like you have heard some sermons
and come early in the morning.

1000
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,157
ls there nothing better to do?

1001
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,421
Move aside.

1002
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,962
Thank you.
- Hey!

1003
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,168
l have two sons.

1004
00:50:05,194 --> 00:50:06,817
Both are useless.

1005
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,601
Where do you think you're going?

1006
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:09,751
Won't we go?

1007
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:13,162
How can you take such a big decision of our life alone?

1008
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,710
The decision of your life?

1009
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:19,414
'lt's true.
They have the right to see their future mother.'

1010
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,771
Yes.
lt's important for you to come along.

1011
00:50:22,797 --> 00:50:23,709
lt's important.

1012
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,544
But remember one thing.

1013
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:27,805
Don't mess it up over there.

1014
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,388
What did he mean?

1015
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,759
May be he meant that we shouldn't act sensible.
Come on.

1016
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,751
'Pappi?'

1017
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:06,987
'There was a time..'

1018
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,958
'..when we wanted to get married to each other.'

1019
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:14,798
'And today,we are going to talk about getting our children married.'

1020
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:19,035
'So what if we couldn't get married when we were young, Dil?'

1021
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,372
'We can get married when our children are young.'

1022
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,339
Hello.

1023
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,682
We have come.

1024
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,277
These are my sons.

1025
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,418
This is my elder son.
Name?

1026
00:51:32,444 --> 00:51:33,740
- Parminder Singh Tiwana.

1027
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,381
Not mine.
l asked yours.

1028
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:38,017
l'm Mani.
- And l'm Gani.

1029
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:44,290
This is my small, incomplete family which you will complete.

1030
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,054
l'll call my daughters.

1031
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,284
Please have a seat.

1032
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,268
Rinky!

1033
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:57,843
Minky!

1034
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,422
These are my daughters.

1035
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,918
The elder one is Minky.

1036
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,021
And the younger one is Rinky.

1037
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,659
Hello.
- Hello.

1038
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:17,363
You have lovely daughters.

1039
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,931
They're bound to be lovely, since they're your daughters.

1040
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,701
Your sons are lovely too.

1041
00:52:22,727 --> 00:52:24,164
They're very innocent.

1042
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,999
Mine are too innocent.
- Father.

1043
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,635
They don't even know how much a caris worth..

1044
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:30,803
..and for how much it needs to be sold.

1045
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:31,744
Father.

1046
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,677
What do your daughters do?

1047
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,474
The younger one is doing MA in English..

1048
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,978
..and the elder one is doing a course in fashion designing.

1049
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,847
Fashion designing?
Very good.

1050
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,920
Then she'll be of great help to us in our garment business.

1051
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,117
That's true.

1052
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,525
Look, your children can be of help in your family business.

1053
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,493
What else do you want?

1054
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:50,225
lt means, car in the house and Gadda Singh is the guard.

1055
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,534
Father, control the race.

1056
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,159
Son, this car has no brakes.

1057
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,240
Father, it's not the car's fault.

1058
00:52:56,266 --> 00:52:57,364
Apply brakes on your mouth.

1059
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,772
l think we should give the children a chance ..

1060
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,707
.. to sit and talk in private.

1061
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,869
Why?

1062
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,038
After all, they're going to live together under one roof.

1063
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,549
They must get to know each other well.

1064
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,309
Oh, yes.
That's very important.

1065
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,888
Or else they might fight with each other.
- Yes.

1066
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,217
Go, children.
Talk to them.

1067
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,012
lt's your first meeting.

1068
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:17,082
Don't mess it up.

1069
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:19,824
Sameto you.

1070
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,627
Come.

1071
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,163
Let's go.

1072
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:25,933
Okay, father.

1073
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,032
You've been touching my feet a lot these days.

1074
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,064
Go, son. Go.
Very good.

1075
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,324
- Come. Come.

1076
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,977
So, you've decided that you'll never listen to sad songs.

1077
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:43,916
Absolutely not.

1078
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,884
l've deleted all the sad songs from my laptop.

1079
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,118
So,will you keep me happy..

1080
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,421
..so that l never have to listen to sad songs ever?

1081
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,462
Happy?.
l've also decided..

1082
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:56,623
..that the day you fast for me, l won't drink alcohol.

1083
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,298
The flowers that you like..

1084
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,960
..l will get them from the village and spread them for you.

1085
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:04,640
Now, everything will happen as you want.

1086
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,932
Really?
- Really.

1087
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:12,003
You're still as beautiful as you were 25 years back.

1088
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:15,516
Thanks.
You haven't changed either.

1089
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,386
You were so-so earlier, and you still are so-so.

1090
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,617
What?.
- l mean, the same physique.

1091
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,421
lt's just that my stomach is bloated now.

1092
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,424
Whats the use of making six packs now?

1093
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,692
There's no one to see those six packs.

1094
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,133
What had happened to Mrs. Pappi?

1095
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:39,140
The kids were very small when she left me and went to God.

1096
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,732
Thank God she didn't go to someone else.

1097
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,904
Pappi, you're still the same.

1098
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,605
You mean cute?

1099
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:50,109
Okay, so tell me, do you want to live or commit suicide?

1100
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,284
lf l couldn't have got married to you..

1101
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,720
..then l would have committed suicide.

1102
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,654
But even now, l'll have to live a suffocating life.

1103
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:58,887
What do you mean?

1104
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:02,829
l mean, l'll have to sacrifice for your sake.
- For me?

1105
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,524
Yes, l'll have to leave my friends.

1106
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,898
l'll have to leave parties and come home by 8.

1107
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,005
Will it be fine if I come by 8.30?

1108
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,434
Look at God's game.

1109
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,175
God brought us together under these circumstances.

1110
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,705
Someone has rightly said..

1111
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,138
l forgot the saying.

1112
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:21,016
Whatever it must be, it must be right.

1113
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,880
So, should l assume that you're okay with this alliance?

1114
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,751
What are you saying?
Unlike?

1115
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:29,552
ln fact, if you don't mind..

1116
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,887
..l think we should have the ring ceremony right away.

1117
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,424
Why would l mind?

1118
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,283
This is great news.

1119
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,251
Then what are you thinking about?

1120
00:55:35,277 --> 00:55:35,981
Call the children quickly.

1121
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,293
We're already too late.

1122
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,129
Rinky! Minky!
- Gani! Mani! Come quickly.

1123
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:46,202
So, by God's grace, our family has flourished.

1124
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,001
l mean,we were three and have now become six.

1125
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:52,047
l hope in the coming years, we'll flourish four times more.

1126
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,207
Take the name of the Lord.

1127
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,282
Father, why did you take out the ring?

1128
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,087
You're asking me my question.

1129
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,256
l want to ask you this question.

1130
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:07,245
Why did you takeout the ring?

1131
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,855
Father,the one who gets married exchanges rings.

1132
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,331
When you know everything, why do you ask stupid questions?

1133
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,333
Let me do it.

1134
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,062
Father, you mean you didn't come here for our marriage?

1135
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,765
You haven't even grown up yet and you want to get married?

1136
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,465
l told you that l've come here for my marriage.

1137
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:20,130
What did you say?

1138
00:56:20,156 --> 00:56:21,625
You had come here with your marriage proposal?

1139
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:22,370
This is strange.

1140
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:23,774
Even the bus conductor doesn't ask..

1141
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:24,902
..so many questions before giving the ticket.

1142
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,106
You all are asking me so many questions.

1143
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,081
Should l give you in writing that l've come for my marriage?

1144
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,545
Don't you feel ashamed?

1145
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,615
You brought your marriage proposal for my daughter?

1146
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,484
For your daughter? No, no, no.

1147
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:34,462
What do you mean?

1148
00:56:34,488 --> 00:56:35,577
That's why l was wondering..

1149
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,182
..why you were so interested in my elder daughter.

1150
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,021
Elder daughter?

1151
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,527
l had a doubt on you since the beginning.

1152
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,878
You will take away what is mine.

1153
00:56:40,904 --> 00:56:41,622
- Have some shame.

1154
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,495
Both of you are misunderstanding.

1155
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,998
l'm not interested in the elder one.

1156
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,535
l see.
This means you're interested in the younger one.

1157
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,229
You didn't even think about your old age.

1158
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,068
You are making up weird stories.

1159
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:52,766
l had heard about the witch that destroys children.

1160
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:53,672
For the first time..

1161
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,710
..l'm seeing a father that destroys children.
- Get lost!

1162
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,838
Mother.

1163
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,108
Run!
- l have a backache!

1164
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:01,659
May you rot in hell!

1165
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:03,343
- Mother, it will break!

1166
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:04,715
Oh, God!
What a trouble!

1167
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,845
Let it be.
Forget it.

1168
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:08,238
Wait, mother!

1169
00:57:08,264 --> 00:57:09,444
- You'll get hurt, mother.

1170
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,959
Stop it, mother.
Relax, mother.

1171
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,688
Mother,they left.
Sit.

1172
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:14,592
Relax.

1173
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,757
lt's okay.
- Okay, relax.

1174
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,131
My backache has made my life miserable!

1175
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,204
Cool down.
- Lets teach him a lesson today.

1176
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:22,980
No, no.
Don't hit him.

1177
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:23,558
He's our father.

1178
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:24,638
l know he's our father.

1179
00:57:24,664 --> 00:57:25,461
He's not a snack.

1180
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,115
Look, don't fight with me.

1181
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:29,196
l've already had a fight inside.

1182
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,710
And talk to me respectfully.

1183
00:57:30,736 --> 00:57:32,000
l'm your only father.

1184
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,345
Today we'll make our only father one-legged.

1185
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:35,904
We'll break the other leg of yours.

1186
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:37,034
You'll atleast sit quietly.

1187
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,982
You came to get us engaged and took out your own ring?
- Yes.

1188
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,537
l didn't come to get you engaged!

1189
00:57:41,563 --> 00:57:42,810
l came to get engaged myself.

1190
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,382
Have some shame.
Have some shame.

1191
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,250
What must they think?

1192
00:57:45,276 --> 00:57:46,248
Those girls are so young.

1193
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,762
You wanted to get engaged to those girls..

1194
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:48,989
..who are of your daughter-in-law's age.

1195
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:50,725
l didn't come to get engaged to them.

1196
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,630
l had come to get engaged to their mother.

1197
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:53,895
To their mother?
- Yes.

1198
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,436
We don't have a problem with that.

1199
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,299
Yes, l too was thinking that this could be a misunderstanding.

1200
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,771
Our father can't be so lowly.

1201
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,502
What do you mean?
- Nothing.

1202
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,306
Tell me something.

1203
00:58:01,332 --> 00:58:03,136
We just went to talk to the girls for a while..

1204
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,306
..and you tried to entice their mother..

1205
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,412
You've stooped so low?
So low?

1206
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,551
We can't bring you here again in the future.

1207
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,981
Our mother-in-law won't even come
to offer tea to us out of fear..

1208
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,885
..that the old man might hold her hand while taking tea.

1209
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,352
Look, we just went away from him..

1210
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,483
..for a while and he tried to fix his marriage.

1211
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:20,027
l'm not that advanced to do it so quickly.

1212
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,021
Khadak Singh had told me that the children didn't get..

1213
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:25,232
..their mother's love and that's why they're spoilt.

1214
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:26,592
So l should get married.

1215
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,195
Khadak Singh spoke about our marriage.

1216
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:31,032
That the boys would come to their senses after getting married.

1217
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,074
How will the boys improve if the father gets married?

1218
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,545
He spoke about my marriage.

1219
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:36,193
- He spoke about our marriage.

1220
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,713
Will we come home early after your marriage?

1221
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:43,849
Whatever it is, l want to get married to her now.

1222
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:47,047
How do l explain to you that she's the one..

1223
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,525
..who l lovedw hen l was in college?

1224
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:50,954
Did she love you too?

1225
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,155
Should l show you her love letters?

1226
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:55,254
Let it be.
l wonder what must be written in it.

1227
00:58:58,568 --> 00:58:59,796
Lets go inside and talk to them.

1228
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,730
Yes, let's get rid of the confusion.
Come.

1229
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,463
Go and do whatever you want.

1230
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:04,939
Aunt.
- Aunt.

1231
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,939
Aunt.
- You're back? - No, no.

1232
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,938
One minute, aunt.
Hit us later.

1233
00:59:08,964 --> 00:59:10,127
Listen to us first.

1234
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,180
Aunt, actually, there's a small confusion.

1235
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:13,680
Our father had come to fix his marriage not with your daughters..

1236
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,340
..but with you.
- Yes.

1237
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,440
With me?

1238
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,317
With mother?

1239
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,953
Yes. We were unnecessarily scared.

1240
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,321
Your father hasn't done anything sensible.

1241
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,953
Heis not sensible anyway, aunt.

1242
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:25,885
Even we know that.

1243
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,397
But what's the problem in that, aunt?

1244
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,131
He was telling us ..

1245
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,894
..that he was in love with you when he was in college.

1246
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,060
What?.

1247
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:35,936
Mother.

1248
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:40,164
Mother, you never told us that before.

1249
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,279
Did your mother do a great thing that she should tell you?

1250
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:47,040
Shut up.
But we want to get mother married.

1251
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,517
lf you could marry the person that you once loved..

1252
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,449
..then nothing can be better than that.

1253
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:54,721
Dear, that can't happen.

1254
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:56,553
Why not, aunt?
Why not?

1255
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,454
Even two sisters get married into one family.

1256
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,256
For the first time, even..

1257
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:01,796
..the mother will go into the same family as the daughters.

1258
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,090
lt will be so much fun.

1259
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:04,971
Let's do one thing.

1260
01:00:04,997 --> 01:00:06,590
Let's get father married to her first..

1261
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:07,727
..and then we'll get married.

1262
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,304
Yes, yes.
You're right.

1263
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,074
Old is first.

1264
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:17,607
Please.

1285
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,134
Congratulations, father.

1286
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,511
- Father,we got you married.

1287
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,452
Thank you, son.

1288
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,887
Father, now talk about our marriage.
- Yes.

1289
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:34,788
Look, son, some relationships can't be formed.

1290
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:35,859
They are formed automatically.

1291
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:36,753
- You're looking beautiful.

1292
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:40,530
Just as Dil is your mother from now on..

1293
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:44,739
..similarly, from now on, Minky and Rinky are your sisters.
- Yes.

1294
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:45,890
Come on, children.

1295
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:48,131
Let your sisters tie 'Rakhi' to you.

1296
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,877
No!

1297
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:54,714
No.
- This marriage can't happen.

1298
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:55,729
What happened, son?

1299
01:00:55,755 --> 01:00:57,140
Whose marriage can't happen?

1300
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,813
Aunt, actually,we forgot to tell you.

1301
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:03,392
Father was telling us outside that he won't get married..

1302
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,517
..into a family in which ladies throw fritters ..

1303
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,525
.. at people unnecessarily.

1304
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:06,993
Yes.
And he also said, ''You can get married to..''

1305
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:10,827
''..Rinky and Minky if you want, if you love them so much.''

1306
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,127
''But l won't get married.''
- He refused.

1307
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,996
One minute.
For the sake of mother's love,we'll apologizeto him.

1308
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:16,765
But uncle will get married to mother.

1309
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:19,101
That too because of a fritter?
No, no, no.

1310
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,699
We can never let our mother's marriage go for a toss.

1311
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:25,280
We will get our mother married to uncle at any cost.
- Yes.

1312
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:26,006
Promise?
- Yes.

1313
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,810
Please try to understand.

1314
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,817
lf they get married, then..
then we won't be able to get married.

1315
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,712
So what?

1316
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:34,352
So what?

1317
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:35,856
This means, for the sake of your mother's love..

1318
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,119
..you're ready to sacrifice our love?

1319
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,996
Yes. We're ready.
Right?

1320
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,126
Aunt, please explain to them.

1321
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:44,640
lt's okay, son.

1322
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:46,402
l'll explain to them.

1323
01:01:46,428 --> 01:01:47,749
They're crazy.

1324
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,062
Mother.

1325
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,872
Rest assured. Go and explain to your father.
- Okay.

1326
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:56,244
Aunt is so nice.

1327
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:57,572
Mother, you..

1328
01:01:57,598 --> 01:01:58,971
- Thank you, aunt.
- From me too.

1329
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,215
We'll have to explain to father properly.

1330
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,288
We'll have to explain to him properly.

1331
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,340
We will snatch..

1332
01:02:11,366 --> 01:02:13,751
- Our rights, my brother.

1333
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:17,857
Mother,we understand everything.

1334
01:02:17,883 --> 01:02:19,626
There's no need to explain to us.

1335
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:21,972
Yes, mother. Please.

1336
01:02:21,998 --> 01:02:24,725
Try to understand what we're saying.

1337
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:27,466
Just agree to marry uncle Parminder, that's it.
- Yes.

1338
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:33,516
Dear, what you think is never possible.

1339
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,674
And l like Gani and Mani.

1340
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:40,317
l want you two to get married to them.

1341
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,057
Mother, please don't worry about our marriage.

1342
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,458
The way we found these boys, we'll find many others.

1343
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,790
Why do you worry, mother?

1344
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,192
Listen to me also.

1345
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:51,459
No, mother.
We don't want to listen to you.

1346
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,183
Just get ready.

1347
01:02:52,209 --> 01:02:53,526
We'll go and apologize to uncle.

1348
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,136
You misbehaved with him by mistake.

1349
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,137
But dear..
- Mother, please.

1350
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,971
Please agree.
- Please.- Please.

1351
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,675
l wonder what those two must be doing.

1352
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:08,241
Sir, just watch how l straighten your back.

1353
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:12,648
No matter what you do, l will..
Slowly!

1354
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:16,781
The way you massage me, you're
going to break my backbone someday!

1355
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:19,259
Back off!
l will get married!

1356
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:21,925
Father, why don't you understand?

1357
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,862
lf you get married to her,
then we won't be able to marry them.

1358
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,830
You're talking about them?

1359
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,867
l'm sure you two can't get married to anyone.

1360
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,937
Why do you want to ruin a girl's life?

1361
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,164
Really?
You can ruin two lives and we can't even ruin one?

1362
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,105
Get lost!

1363
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:36,470
Uncle, explain to him. Make him see sense.

1364
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,577
He has dyed his grey hair black on your saying.

1365
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:41,275
Do you have to pay the bill for that?
- Stop it!

1366
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,843
Why are you all screaming so much?

1367
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:45,318
And l didn't know this.

1368
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:49,881
When l gave him the idea,
l didn't know what was on his mind.

1369
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,620
Parminder,why did you have to do this?

1370
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:56,391
What havel done?

1371
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,158
l just gave her the marriage proposal.

1372
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,661
lf it was some other girl, l would have refused.

1373
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:02,629
This is my love.

1374
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,772
Did you see how crazy he is about his love?

1375
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:08,070
lf you're so concerned about love, then get us married.

1376
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:11,374
ln just two years, we'll give you little grandchildren.

1377
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,846
Yes, then you can love them and clean them too.

1378
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,111
ls this my age to bathe them?

1379
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,650
You're going to give me little kids to love.

1380
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,621
l'm going to get you a mother to love.
ls that less?

1381
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,112
So you won't agree?

1382
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:25,910
- l won't.
Because love never bows down.

1383
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:27,561
You're trying to be a hero.

1384
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,899
You can't stand straight and
you're saying love never bows down.

1385
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,934
l've bowed down to respect it.

1386
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:38,570
Until l get my love, l won't straighten up.

1387
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,232
Come inside and straighten my back.

1388
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,808
Move!
He has seen the world.

1389
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,946
We will straighten you up, father.

1390
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,313
Why are you wasting your time on him?

1391
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,618
Go and get married to those girls.

1392
01:04:49,644 --> 01:04:50,809
He'll back off himself.

1393
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,242
Uncle, what do we tell you?

1394
01:04:52,268 --> 01:04:53,345
The girls are crazy.

1395
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,890
They want to get their mother married to our father.

1396
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:56,964
Uncle, he's our father.

1397
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,679
We'll threaten him and explain to him.

1398
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,091
The girls won't agree.

1399
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:00,959
Don't worry.

1400
01:05:00,985 --> 01:05:02,382
l'll explain to him.

1401
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,031
Who is it?
Hello.

1402
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:12,834
Hello.
We've brought mother to apologize to uncle.

1403
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:13,897
No, no.
There's no need.

1404
01:05:13,923 --> 01:05:14,729
There's no problem.

1405
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,040
But we're already outside your house.
- What?

1406
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,209
Just open the gate.
Okay?. Bye.

1407
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,281
What happened now, brother?

1408
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:24,717
The girls want to apologize to father.

1409
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,151
Then you should have forbidden them.

1410
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,722
They're standing outside at the gate.

1411
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,360
lf they meet father,then forget about the marriage.

1412
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:33,519
We'll have to do something.

1413
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:34,488
Do onething.

1414
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:35,894
You go and open the gate.

1415
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,221
l'll think of something.

1416
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,426
Are you sure?
- Yes.

1417
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:40,761
Oh, God!

1418
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,767
Hello again.
- Hello.

1419
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:48,673
Come.

1420
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:49,903
Come, mother.

1421
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:55,951
Come, mother.

1422
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:58,881
Father, you?

1423
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:01,786
lts father.
- Hello, uncle.

1424
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:02,948
Hello.
- Hello.

1425
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,026
l think uncle is still upset.

1426
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,187
He's very angry.

1427
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,094
Since he's back, he's been standing like that.

1428
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:11,631
But why is he wrapped in a blanket?

1429
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:12,756
Whatever he found at the moment.

1430
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:15,268
l mean,whenever he is angry,..

1431
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,872
..he wraps himself with what ever he finds.

1432
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:19,998
He's still angry.

1433
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:21,784
We're really sorry, uncle.

1434
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:22,831
- Yes. Sorry, uncle.

1435
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:23,912
Mother, tell him.

1436
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:28,206
l just.. l threw the fritters by mistake.

1437
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,612
Fine.
Now leave.

1438
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:36,517
lt was my fault that l thought of marrying your mother.

1439
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:41,623
Listen, girls.
l will get you married to my sons any how.

1440
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,057
Father, you're the best!

1441
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:46,194
Sorry. Sorry.
- Don't let the blanket slip.

1442
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,803
Look, girls, now don't insist.

1443
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:52,162
Did you hear me?

1444
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,242
Just quietly get married to my sons.

1445
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,408
You won't find such boys in the whole world.

1446
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,120
l have two sons.

1447
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:01,497
Both are very nice.

1448
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:03,742
People say that Pappi is fortunate.

1449
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,084
lt's not my fate.

1450
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:06,640
The credit goes to me.

1451
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:08,445
Did you hear?

1452
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:13,187
l too want the children to get married.

1453
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,896
Please keep my girls with love.

1454
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,532
l've brought them up with a lot of love.

1455
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:21,388
Did you hear?

1456
01:07:21,414 --> 01:07:22,122
We're not going..

1457
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:23,796
..to make them fill airin tires with a pump.

1458
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:25,769
l mean,we'll keep them with love.

1459
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,466
Now leave.
Did you hear me?

1460
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,942
l'll go and straighten myback.

1461
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:33,380
l mean l'll rest.
- Yes, absolutely.

1462
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:34,235
But uncle, you..

1463
01:07:34,261 --> 01:07:35,202
- Come on. Comeon.

1464
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,563
Okay, aunt. Bye.

1465
01:07:36,589 --> 01:07:38,739
Go and shop for the wedding. Go.

1466
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,683
Never mind.
You have to comeback to this house.

1467
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,164
Why are you looking there?

1468
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:42,840
lt's our father.

1469
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:48,930
Dil. Dil, you're here?

1470
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,537
Uncle, you're here?

1471
01:07:50,563 --> 01:07:51,957
Then who's that?

1472
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,033
l'll show you.

1473
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:58,204
Father..
- l have two sons. Both are useless.

1474
01:07:58,441 --> 01:07:59,408
Father, don't say anything to father.

1475
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:00,804
People say that l'm ill-fated.

1476
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:02,494
What's my fate's fault?

1477
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,801
They are useless.

1478
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:08,076
When you're here,why did they need to do this drama?

1479
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:10,015
l'll tell you why they did this drama.

1480
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:13,145
Because both of them didn't want me to get married to Dil.

1481
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:15,947
Oh. So you're ready to marry mother?

1482
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:19,585
Dear, l was always ready to marry your mother.

1483
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:20,957
Then why did you marry our mother?

1484
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:24,555
Actually, son, l had promised Dilraj's father on his death bed..

1485
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:27,329
..that l would surely marry his daughter Dil.

1486
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,797
Butit couldn't happen.

1487
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,030
Because when l went to the hospital to tell my father about it..

1488
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,534
..he was dead already.

1489
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,036
But before dying, he made me
promise him that l would marry..

1490
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:42,276
..his friend Pritam Singh's daughter Preeto.

1491
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:45,315
Because their family had done a lot of favors on our family.

1492
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:50,552
But your mother Preeto loved me just as much as l loved Dil.

1493
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:53,218
That's why l told her everything about Dil.

1494
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,827
ln spite of that, she loved me a lot.

1495
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,489
Aunt was so nice, wasn't she?

1496
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,658
All aunties aren ice.

1497
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,327
But uncles..

1498
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,745
Dear, she was nice.

1499
01:09:04,771 --> 01:09:06,695
But she was very innocent.

1500
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,503
Along with me, she would love animals too.

1501
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,575
You were very young then.

1502
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:14,883
Your mother and l left you at your
aunt's house and went on an outing.

1503
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:18,286
She was showing me a tiny rabbit from above a mountain.

1504
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:22,453
She slipped and fell in a river below.

1505
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:26,822
After that, neither was the rabbit found, nor your mother.

1506
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,362
Fine.
You couldn't find the rabbit.

1507
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:30,329
But you should've looked for aunt then and got married.

1508
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:31,922
We wouldn't have to see this day.

1509
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:34,467
Son, it's not that l didn't try to look for her.

1510
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:35,518
l tried a lot.

1511
01:09:35,544 --> 01:09:36,737
l found her too.

1512
01:09:36,763 --> 01:09:38,725
But it was too late by then.

1513
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,741
Why?.
Was it 11.30 by then?

1514
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,710
She was already with someone.

1515
01:09:42,736 --> 01:09:43,894
She was married.

1516
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,409
Let by gones be by ones.

1517
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:50,813
And it's not our age to get married now.

1518
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,585
lt's the children's age.

1519
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,517
We must get the children married.

1520
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:58,686
No, Dil.

1521
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:02,394
l've already sacrificed my love once..

1522
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:03,829
..for the sake of my father's promise.

1523
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,663
Now it's time to fulfill the promise that l made to my love.

1524
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,364
And l will do it.

1525
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:11,865
One more thing.

1526
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,640
l can't live without Dil.

1527
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:19,378
lf that's the matter, then even we
can't live without Rinky and Minky.

1528
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:20,654
You know what?

1529
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,905
But we can live without you.

1530
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:25,681
Dear,this means you want me to get married to your mother?

1531
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,015
But this marriage can't happen.

1532
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:28,953
We will marry you.

1533
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,389
Please don't be stub born.

1534
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:31,823
We had told you that we can sacrifice any joy..

1535
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,896
..for the sake of our mother's happiness.

1536
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:38,295
We will get our mother married to uncle Parminder at any cost.

1537
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,267
lf that's the matter, then we too
will get married to you at any cost.

1538
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:56,477
Welcome.

1539
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:58,178
One minute!

1540
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:04,751
''Let us offer water. Be our father's forever.''

1541
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,590
''Don't be shy.''

1542
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:12,292
''Father and aunt are standing outside.
The water..''

1543
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,008
''Let us offer water.

1544
01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:18,530
Be our father's forever.''

1545
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,041
''Don't be shy.''

1546
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:25,704
''Father and aunt are standing outside.
The water..''

1547
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:29,944
What happened, son?

1548
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,118
What happened?
- Actually..

1549
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:35,587
lnstead of water,we had offered poison to you!
- Why?.

1550
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:37,214
You consumed poison?
But why?.

1551
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:39,651
What's the use of this life in..

1552
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:42,959
..which the father is not bothered about his sons?

1553
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,965
But son, why did you drink poison?

1554
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:49,128
Father, don't worry about that.
Go inside.

1555
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:54,909
Your room has been decorated. Milk..
- Milk?

1556
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:58,377
Yes,the glass of milk is kept in the corner.

1557
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:02,949
Drink..that. And from inside..
- From inside..

1558
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,487
Yes? What?
What do we do from inside?

1559
01:12:05,513 --> 01:12:07,946
- Don't forget to lock from inside.

1560
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,121
Mother, what happened?

1561
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,864
This Dolu has made our lives miserable.

1562
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:18,698
He doesn't even let you sleep peacefully.

1563
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,196
Dolu didn't come in my dream.

1564
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:24,435
Today Gani and Mani camein my dream.

1565
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,768
They tried to kill you?

1566
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:29,509
They didn't try to kill me.
- Then?

1567
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,143
They tried to kill themselves.

1568
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,010
Kill them? Why?.

1569
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:40,215
ln the dream, l was married to your uncle Pappi.

1570
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:44,991
Really?
- And his sons consumed poison.

1571
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:49,754
Thank God!
At least our mother is dreaming about her wedding.

1572
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,423
You'll never be sensible.

1573
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:53,228
You be sensible too.

1574
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:56,302
God has brought you two together after 25 years.

1575
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:59,703
He too wants you two to reunite.

1576
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,534
You like those boys too.

1577
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:07,680
We like them, mother, but not more than you.

1578
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:12,353
lfl get married at this age..

1579
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:15,114
..then what will people think about your mother?

1580
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,949
What will they think?
- Nothing.

1581
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,186
No.

1582
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,824
This can never happen.

1583
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:29,900
The door of this life should be shut.

1584
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:32,601
Come on!
- Son, what are you doing?

1585
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,174
What are you doing?
- Come on!

1586
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:38,546
Don't you dare step out of this house!

1587
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,477
We won't spare you.
- Yes.

1588
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:43,779
l know that.
But don't be so merciless.

1589
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,545
And this is not my recent love.

1590
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:49,350
This is my 25-30 years old love.

1591
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:51,101
l can't live without Dil!

1592
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:52,349
l can't! l can't!

1593
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:54,520
Did you see how he's crying like a teenager?

1594
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:56,460
Love?
ls this your age to fall in love?

1595
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,828
How do l explain to you that this is the age?

1596
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:01,165
And if children behave strictly with their parents..

1597
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:02,895
..then parents get spoilt.
Yes.

1598
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:05,438
The way he is crying as if he has not seen anything in life.

1599
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:06,285
Yes. Stay here!

1600
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:08,194
You'll get your food here!
Let's go.

1601
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,369
Lock it from outside.

1602
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:12,711
Try to understand.
l'm not hungry for food.

1603
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,093
l'm hungry for love!

1604
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:16,867
l'm hungry for love!
l'm hungry for love!

1605
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,560
''Your heart should be young.''

1606
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:38,165
''There's nothing in the age.''

1607
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,098
''l'll show you what it means.''

1608
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:43,597
Where had you gone?

1609
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,998
l.. had gone to the showroom.

1610
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,575
Really?.
You were not at the showroom.

1611
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,093
Why are you looking down?

1612
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:51,297
Look into our eyes and talk.

1613
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,427
l was not at the showroom.

1614
01:15:53,453 --> 01:15:54,999
l had gone to a funeral.

1615
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:59,747
What funeral was so important that you climbed down like Spiderman?

1616
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,218
lt was my friend's funeral.

1617
01:16:02,244 --> 01:16:03,682
lt was important to go.

1618
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:04,994
Use your brain.

1619
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,820
Peopleof your age are dead already.

1620
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,557
And you'rerunning after rickshaws.

1621
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:12,327
ln my sorrow, l forgot that it wasn't my friend's funeral.

1622
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:13,867
lt was my friend's father's funeral.

1623
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,741
The funeral gets over by 1 o'clock.

1624
01:16:15,767 --> 01:16:17,096
Where were you after that?.

1625
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:20,548
After that..we went to get flowers for his father.

1626
01:16:20,574 --> 01:16:21,566
- Look at him.

1627
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,769
What flowers were so special that you offer after the funeral is over?

1628
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,507
The one whose father died should have this objection.

1629
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,345
Why are you interfering unnecessarily?

1630
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:30,971
We don't know abou this father.

1631
01:16:30,997 --> 01:16:32,270
But one thing is for sure.

1632
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:33,981
lf you don't mend your ways..

1633
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:35,817
..then our father's funeral is going to happen too.

1634
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,482
And one more thing.

1635
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,125
Those flowers will not be offered before or after.

1636
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:42,526
Only the bier will be lifted.

1637
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,726
l have two sons..
- Shut up!

1638
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:44,718
Why were you being a hero?

1639
01:19:44,744 --> 01:19:46,468
Couldn't you have come home?

1640
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:47,674
You've caught a cold now.

1641
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:55,815
Dil, how do l explain to you that
even today, l love you as much as l..

1642
01:19:58,059 --> 01:19:59,356
God bless you.

1643
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:04,595
l know that you love me a lot too.

1644
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:08,803
But you've hidden it fearing the world.

1645
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:16,076
Try to understand how important our marriageis to the kids.

1646
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,045
To hear a yes from you..

1647
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,274
l've..

1648
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:25,744
..been yearning.

1649
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:55,011
Pappi, people say that before you begin a good deed..

1650
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,484
..you shouldn't sneeze.

1651
01:20:57,652 --> 01:20:59,244
lt's considered a bad omen.

1652
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:00,981
Apply this balm.

1653
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:13,894
Thank you, Dil.

1654
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:18,068
What will people say?

1655
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:20,302
People won't say anything, mother.
- Don't worry.

1656
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:21,137
Why do you worry?.

1657
01:21:21,163 --> 01:21:22,458
- Everything will be all right.

1658
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:26,079
But my daughters..

1659
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:32,053
Daughters.

1660
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,783
Brother, you may slap me if you want to..

1661
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,517
..but what had the photo done to you?

1662
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,891
l'll fulfill your wish to be slapped as well.

1663
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:45,022
But don't you dare look for marriage proposals for those girls.

1664
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:50,695
Brother, l'll sell snacks after this..

1665
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:54,872
..but l'll never look for marriage proposals for any girl.

1666
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:02,080
Hello, Goga Marriage Bureau.

1667
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:04,912
Goga,the snack-seller speaking.

1668
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:07,079
The snack-seller?

1669
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,620
Tell all this nonsense to your aunt.

1670
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:11,316
Listen to me carefully.

1671
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,627
l mean, l'm Parminder Singh Pappi.
- Yes. Yes.

1672
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,630
The girls whose proposals you had brought for my sons..
- Yes.

1673
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,462
..look for even better boys for them soon.

1674
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:21,678
Done. Done.

1675
01:22:21,704 --> 01:22:23,619
- You'll have to.

1676
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:26,396
l'll send the snacks.

1677
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:31,509
Do you think l'm an idiot?

1678
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:34,475
Or do l look like a crazy man to you?

1679
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:36,877
lt was Parminder Singh's call.

1680
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:40,318
He was asking for marriage proposals for Dilraj Kaur's daughters.

1681
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,358
Take marriage proposals to him.
Do it.

1682
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:48,794
But you don't have to look for boys.

1683
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:50,929
Brother,what are you saying?

1684
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,466
l've already found the boys.

1685
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,769
Hello.
- Hello.

1686
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:05,904
Hello.

1687
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,379
Son, it's written over there that you're not allowed..

1688
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:08,813
..to pluck flowers and you plucked them.

1689
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,646
Okay?
- Father.

1690
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:14,119
The one with the blue turban is Dr. Sukhnain Singh.

1691
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,281
The other one is Lakhwinder Singh.

1692
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,052
He has his own marriage palace.

1693
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:21,356
l've found out everything about them from Goga for my satisfaction.

1694
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,657
Dil, if you want to ask them any
questions,then you're most welcome.

1695
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,399
lf you agree,then l agree too.

1696
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,472
But it all depends on their choice.

1697
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:35,372
But uncle..
- We'll fix the marriage only if you give your consent.

1698
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:38,446
Until then, you can make arrangements for our wedding.
- Oh!

1699
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,709
Yes.
- That's true.

1700
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:44,609
l wonder what else we'll haveto do for their wedding.

1701
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,084
Here you go.

1702
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:53,586
- Take it.
We have a right now.

1703
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,256
Thank you.

1704
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:00,699
Everything happened so soon, right?

1705
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,503
l don't believe it.

1706
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:06,340
Dolu won't believe it either.

1707
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:07,978
Dolu?
- No.

1708
01:24:08,004 --> 01:24:12,362
He means to say that Goga had told us..

1709
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:15,678
..that Dolu wants to get you married to the boys of his choice.
- Yes.

1710
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:19,985
But it eventually happened with us.

1711
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:22,386
Don't get too excited.

1712
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:24,682
We're doing all this for the sake of our mother's love.

1713
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,090
Don't say that.

1714
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:32,226
l've thought of a name for our elder son too.

1715
01:24:32,252 --> 01:24:33,883
Excuse me. No.

1716
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:36,829
They had called us here.

1717
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:42,438
So,what were you saying?

1718
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:44,011
What have you named him?

1719
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:46,808
Jasdev Singh Bitto.

1720
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:48,328
Minky, what's going on?

1721
01:24:48,354 --> 01:24:49,373
Leave her hand.

1722
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:51,811
Who are these idiots?

1723
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:52,995
Talk with respect.

1724
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:54,812
They're our future partners.

1725
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:55,913
Partners?
What do you mean?

1726
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,617
She means husband.

1727
01:24:58,760 --> 01:24:59,584
l'll thrash you.

1728
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:00,844
You'll be her husband?

1729
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:04,227
He's right.
We've called you here to meet them.

1730
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:07,597
Yes.
Our future father has chosen them for us.

1731
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:08,760
He has chosen them?

1732
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:09,925
Why are you joking?

1733
01:25:09,951 --> 01:25:12,558
Even their parents must have not chosen them.

1734
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:14,835
We're not joking.
lt's true.

1735
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:20,781
Look, what you're doing to us is not right.
lt's wrong.

1736
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,179
Whether it's right or wrong, this is going to happen.

1737
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:25,980
Because our mother and your father's wedding has been fixed.

1738
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,112
That can't happen.
- lt has happened.

1739
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:30,122
The wedding is after two days.

1740
01:25:30,148 --> 01:25:31,775
We have no other option.

1741
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:34,624
We just want to request you that..

1742
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:38,289
..please do not obstruct our mother and father's wedding.

1743
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:39,593
Please.

1744
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:42,100
So, excuse me, please.

1745
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:45,633
Rinky.
- Excuseme.

1746
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:38,063
We had imagined so many things.

1747
01:26:38,089 --> 01:26:39,408
We had so many dreams.

1748
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:42,520
That we would become grooms to gether.

1749
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,120
What did we do to anyone..

1750
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:46,959
..that this happened to us?

1751
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:50,765
l don't know whether we've done anything to anyone or not.

1752
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,531
But our father ruined everything for us.

1753
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:56,268
lfl knew that father would do this to us..

1754
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,947
..we would have never let father get married.

1755
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:04,416
Mani, how could we have stopped the wedding?

1756
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,453
We weren't there then.

1757
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:10,385
Father is getting married again and we can't stop that either.

1758
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:12,483
But its mother's fault.

1759
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,696
lf she hadn't left father..

1760
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:18,564
..we wouldn't have to face all this.

1761
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:20,290
Why just father?

1762
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:24,566
Mother left us alone too.

1763
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:00,966
lf mother was here, Mani, she wouldn't have let this wedding take place.

1764
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:07,641
What's the use of crying now?

1765
01:28:09,584 --> 01:28:10,846
Has the dead ever returned?

1766
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:21,388
Mother?

1767
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,692
See.
- Mother?

1768
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:32,935
How are you?

1769
01:28:41,549 --> 01:28:44,017
No, sir. No.

1770
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:50,853
l agree that my wife resembles your mother.

1771
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:54,209
But my wife in your mother's place..

1772
01:28:54,235 --> 01:28:55,519
- Okay. Okay.

1773
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:56,893
No. No. No.

1774
01:28:57,031 --> 01:29:00,467
Look,we're small time thieves.

1775
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:04,799
We pick wallets fallen on the street.

1776
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,613
But this is fraud.

1777
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,578
We won't do a fraud.

1778
01:29:08,604 --> 01:29:10,526
Did you understand?

1779
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:13,045
Brother. Brother, don't lie.

1780
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,512
The kind of a person you are..

1781
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:16,947
..you can pick money from within a man's pocket.

1782
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:19,281
He's right.

1783
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:22,515
But fraud is fraud.
No. No.

1784
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:27,185
Of course. lf the police catch us, they'll thrash him.

1785
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:32,463
She's crazy.
She winks and disappears.

1786
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,738
How dare you! To hell with you!

1787
01:29:33,764 --> 01:29:34,718
- One minute!
Oneminute!

1788
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:38,033
Hello!
- ldiot!

1789
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:39,571
You're fighting amongst yourself.

1790
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,138
lt's just the matter of four days, brother.

1791
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:43,472
Once our father's marriage is called off..

1792
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:45,307
..you can go to jail and we'll go to our house.

1793
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:47,339
You can go to your house and we'll go to our house.

1794
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:50,918
Listen to me.
l'm aman.

1795
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:56,718
How can l see my wife being someone else's wife in front of me?

1796
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:58,791
Brother.
Brother, don'tworry.

1797
01:29:58,817 --> 01:30:00,444
Our father is a saint.

1798
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:01,994
He's a saint.

1799
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:06,792
Such men look at ladies cycles and say..

1800
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:10,597
''Brother, it has such a nice figure.''

1801
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:13,004
That's true! That's true!
- Listen to me!

1802
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:16,372
What kind of a saintly man is planning to get married at this age?

1803
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:19,275
Brother. Brother.
Brother, listen to me.

1804
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:21,514
Look at our innocent faces.

1805
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:26,050
There's no such song that w ecan dance on at our father's wedding.

1806
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:27,124
Come here, brother.

1807
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:27,839
Listen to me.

1808
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:31,323
Please agree.
- We'll pay you whatever you demand. Rs. 1 lakh.

1809
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:34,656
1..
- 2 lakhs.- 2 lakhs.

1810
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:37,697
3 lakhs. 3 lakhs.
- 5 lakhs.

1811
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:39,959
Give us if you want to, or else leave.

1812
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:41,659
Fine. We agree.
We agree.

1813
01:30:41,803 --> 01:30:44,795
They agree!

1814
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,906
But tell me what l have to do.
- Tell us.

1815
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:49,496
Thank you. Thank you.

1816
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:58,027
Where is she?
- Stop! This wedding can't happen!

1817
01:32:58,172 --> 01:32:59,196
Why can't it happen?

1818
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:00,671
We didn't say anything.

1819
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:03,067
Yes, father. That wasn't our voice.
- Yes.

1820
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:06,169
Who else has come to obstruct the wedding?
- l have.

1821
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:16,513
Mother!

1822
01:33:16,657 --> 01:33:18,887
Preeto, you?
- Yes, it's me.

1823
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:21,256
You're alive?
- Yes.

1824
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:22,420
How's that possible?

1825
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:23,831
This can happen.

1826
01:33:23,857 --> 01:33:27,025
But your second marriage can't happen.

1827
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:30,969
l just went away from you for 16-17 years..

1828
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:34,139
..and you're getting married again?

1829
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:35,741
Who is she, Pappi?

1830
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:40,144
That's my question that l should ask you.

1831
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:42,680
But since you've asked, let me answer you.

1832
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:47,447
l'm his wife. P.P.S.D.

1833
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:53,428
Mrs. Preeto Pappi Singh Deewana.

1834
01:33:53,454 --> 01:33:54,780
- Yes.

1835
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:56,661
P.P.S.D.

1836
01:33:57,531 --> 01:34:02,366
You're not Mrs. Pappi, but an old bus from the highway.

1837
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:04,801
Now tell me your number too.

1838
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:07,069
You can'tbe my wife.

1839
01:34:07,095 --> 01:34:08,925
You're Preeto's look alike.

1840
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:14,710
l saw Preeto dying falling from the
mountain and drowning in the river.

1841
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:16,913
While falling, she was saying, ''l'm dead.

1842
01:34:16,939 --> 01:34:17,943
l'm dead. l'm dead.''

1843
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:20,213
A falling person never lies.

1844
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:22,151
You're wrong, sir.

1845
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:25,623
Actually, a dying person never lies.
- Yes.

1846
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,320
A falling person may lie.
- Yes.

1847
01:34:28,429 --> 01:34:30,954
When she fell, she lost her memory.

1848
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:33,589
Who are you, wearing extra large clothes of children?

1849
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:36,601
Why are you defending her?
- Her husband.

1850
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:38,905
l had come with her to look for her husband.
- Yes.

1851
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:39,842
You've come to look.

1852
01:34:39,868 --> 01:34:41,090
You'retrying to be Columbus.

1853
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:42,368
You're lying.

1854
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:45,104
l'm telling the truth.
l'm telling the truth.

1855
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:46,236
Listen, everyone.

1856
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:50,908
17 years ago, l had gone to the river bank.

1857
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:52,713
l saw her lying near the river.

1858
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:54,745
Her tongue was out like that.

1859
01:34:54,771 --> 01:34:56,336
So l brought her home.

1860
01:34:56,457 --> 01:34:59,756
You idiot.
You gave her first aid without washing your hands?

1861
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:01,589
You brought her home?

1862
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:03,228
lf you were so sympathetic..

1863
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:04,592
..then why did you keep her in your house for 17 years?

1864
01:35:04,732 --> 01:35:06,029
Why didn't you bring herto my house?

1865
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:10,827
When l went to her, she said l have lost my memory..

1866
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:12,370
..take me home. So l took her to my house.
- Yes.

1867
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:15,965
A person who loses his memory doesn't say that he has lost his memory.

1868
01:35:16,077 --> 01:35:19,672
A person who loses his memory can say anything.

1869
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:22,879
Enough. Don't go crazy again.

1870
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:26,680
l know how l've served her for 17 years.

1871
01:35:26,821 --> 01:35:29,221
l have kept her with me.

1872
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:31,791
The day before, she went outside to get milk.

1873
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:34,588
While buying milk, she regained her memory.

1874
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:38,756
She said, ''How did the price of milk become Rs. 50 overnight?''

1875
01:35:38,866 --> 01:35:40,959
''Where did the Chetak scooters go?''

1876
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:42,963
''Who's Yo Yo Honey Singh?''

1877
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:45,265
l said, ''Silly girl, what do l tell you?

1878
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:46,873
There's a new one now with seven gears.''

1879
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:49,841
Whoever has come in the way, he has removed them.

1880
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:51,402
She said, ''Forget all that.

1881
01:35:51,428 --> 01:35:52,938
Just take me to my family.''

1882
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:55,345
''l want to meet my little kids.''

1883
01:35:55,449 --> 01:35:57,576
You're lying. You're lying.

1884
01:35:57,818 --> 01:36:00,343
She's not my wife. My wife is dead.

1885
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:01,682
l saw her..

1886
01:36:01,822 --> 01:36:06,885
ln order to get married again, you want to kill me.

1887
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:08,938
Go. Go, my husband.

1888
01:36:08,964 --> 01:36:13,920
Get married again if you want to, but don't kill me.

1889
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:18,128
l will spend the rest of my life with my little kids.

1890
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,441
They're not little anymore.

1891
01:36:19,467 --> 01:36:20,357
They've grown big.

1892
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:21,387
Where are they?

1893
01:36:21,413 --> 01:36:22,658
Where are my children?

1894
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:23,869
Where are they? Where are they?
- Stop it.

1895
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:25,775
Don't overact.
- Okay.

1896
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:27,674
Where are my kids?
Where are they?

1897
01:36:27,815 --> 01:36:30,215
Mother! Mother!
- Mother!

1898
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:33,286
Gani!
- Come. Come.

1899
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:38,221
Mani! My little kids!

1900
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:40,224
Mother, why did you leave us?

1901
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:43,387
Mother, father harassed us a lot.
- Yes.

1902
01:36:43,497 --> 01:36:45,522
l'll never leave you again.

1903
01:36:48,169 --> 01:36:48,628
Here you go.

1904
01:36:48,654 --> 01:36:50,185
The children have found their mother..

1905
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:51,431
..and the mother has found her children.

1906
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:52,732
Sir, your wedding is cancelled.

1907
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:53,898
Why?
Why is it cancelled?

1908
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:57,909
Father, you wanted a new mother for
us so that we get a mother's love.

1909
01:36:58,045 --> 01:36:59,215
Right, Mani? See.

1910
01:36:59,241 --> 01:37:02,336
Our real mother is standing in front of us.

1911
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:04,417
This means father won't get married now?

1912
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:07,316
No, Mani.
A person cannot get married again..

1913
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:08,853
..when he's already married to his first wife.

1914
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:10,617
Father is so nice.

1915
01:37:10,758 --> 01:37:12,419
lnspector, explain to him.

1916
01:37:12,526 --> 01:37:17,020
Why are you ruining my marriage alongwith these frauds?

1917
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:18,359
Hey!

1918
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:21,661
Stop this family drama.

1919
01:37:21,802 --> 01:37:23,292
lnspector, you too?

1920
01:37:23,537 --> 01:37:24,970
Yes, Mr. Parminder.

1921
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:28,369
And don't you dare misbehave with Ms. Preeto.

1922
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:30,977
lt has been proved that she is your wife.

1923
01:37:31,111 --> 01:37:34,308
And until you prove that she's not your wife..

1924
01:37:34,448 --> 01:37:36,211
..she will live in your house.

1925
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:38,116
Hey! Stop the music!

1926
01:37:38,142 --> 01:37:40,435
The wedding is cancelled!

1927
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,720
Come on.
- Thank you.

1928
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:44,017
Mother.

1929
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:46,590
Come on. Enough of your mother's love.
Come on.

1930
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:48,059
Uncle, shut up.

1931
01:37:55,936 --> 01:38:00,498
How do l prove that she's not Preeto, but Preeto's look alike?

1932
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:02,326
Give me a solution.

1933
01:38:02,352 --> 01:38:03,734
How do l get rid of her?

1934
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:05,071
You have seen the world.

1935
01:38:05,312 --> 01:38:08,645
l havenot seen the world.
l'm just on the roads..

1936
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:11,376
For God's sakes don't talk about old issues.

1937
01:38:11,518 --> 01:38:12,419
l'm already troubled.

1938
01:38:12,445 --> 01:38:14,376
Tell me if you have any good advice for me.

1939
01:38:14,588 --> 01:38:17,148
l do have an advice, but only if you listen to me.

1940
01:38:23,297 --> 01:38:25,595
This one is beautiful too.
Keep her.

1941
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:28,526
Do you haveany shame?

1942
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:32,138
l mean to say that your aim is to improve your sons.

1943
01:38:32,273 --> 01:38:37,210
But why don't you understand that Pappi belongs only to Dil now?

1944
01:38:37,811 --> 01:38:41,474
Pappi can't think of anyone else besides Dil.

1945
01:38:41,715 --> 01:38:43,307
Don't dream too much.

1946
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:44,984
You are not her real husband.

1947
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:46,852
That you can't live without
her.

1948
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:52,192
That gives mean idea.

1949
01:39:10,411 --> 01:39:11,512
Hello, Rinki dear.

1950
01:39:11,538 --> 01:39:14,839
Come to my house with your mother at 10 pm tomorrow.

1951
01:39:22,389 --> 01:39:24,789
Thank you.
Thank you for cooling me down.

1952
01:39:24,892 --> 01:39:28,225
But l won't let my wife go to your father's room.

1953
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:29,336
You don't understand.

1954
01:39:29,362 --> 01:39:31,356
Our father is a man of good values.
- Yes.

1955
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:34,491
Let him have seminars in his house to display his good values.

1956
01:39:34,601 --> 01:39:37,729
Let him have discussions whether she is his wife or no.

1957
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:40,533
But why is he calling my wife to his room?

1958
01:39:40,674 --> 01:39:43,108
Shutup! You idiot!

1959
01:39:43,243 --> 01:39:44,835
She just has to act.

1960
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:48,446
Brother, if you want someone to act, then hire an actress.

1961
01:39:48,582 --> 01:39:54,020
Am l anyless than an actress?
l agree.

1962
01:39:55,055 --> 01:39:58,889
''A mother is a mother.''

1963
01:39:59,193 --> 01:40:01,559
Hey!
Don't act like Gurdaas Mann.

1964
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:05,392
l know about your mother, but l
know nothing about your father.

1965
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:08,558
Rajjo.
Fool, we can't do this.

1966
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:10,192
Pilla.

1967
01:40:10,604 --> 01:40:11,730
Hello.

1968
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:14,968
l'm doing all this to make money.

1969
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:18,440
Silly girl, we can make money by committing petty thefts..

1970
01:40:18,545 --> 01:40:21,207
..but we don't want money from people's beds.

1971
01:40:21,315 --> 01:40:22,839
Don't you trust me?

1972
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:24,611
No. l can't let this happen.

1973
01:40:24,752 --> 01:40:25,943
Why won't you let it happen?

1974
01:40:25,969 --> 01:40:27,541
We've made a deal of 5 lakhs.
- Yes.

1975
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:30,283
The 5 lakh deal was different.

1976
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:32,722
lf you want me to live in your father's room..

1977
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:34,794
..then you'll have to pay 1 lakh extra.

1978
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:36,822
Okay,fine.
We'll give you 1 lakh.

1979
01:40:36,964 --> 01:40:40,730
l agree!
- No! l don't agree!

1980
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:43,268
Rajjo, if you go to their father's room..

1981
01:40:43,404 --> 01:40:45,668
..then you'll have to go over my dead body.

1982
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:48,037
Your dead body won't be that long.

1983
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:49,802
lt can be crossed in two steps.

1984
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:52,105
l'm your uncle!
- Break his legs.

1985
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:55,477
Be careful that the corpse is not hurt.

1986
01:40:55,616 --> 01:40:59,552
We will beat you.
- 6 lakhs!

1987
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:15,032
''The weather seems very naughty today.''

1988
01:41:15,969 --> 01:41:18,301
''lt seems very wicked.''

1989
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:21,602
''The weather..''

1990
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:24,233
You seem even wickeder than the weather.

1991
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:25,437
Really?

1992
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,012
What are you doing?

1993
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:30,679
l'm being wicked.
- Move your hand.

1994
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:37,181
God has brought us together after so many years.

1995
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:40,626
Let's sit and talk for a while.

1996
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:43,594
What is it that you can't talk about without sitting?

1997
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:47,894
Mrs. Pappi, in order to run the family smoothly..

1998
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:51,365
..the husband and wife have to walk together.

1999
01:41:51,738 --> 01:41:56,038
You have to walk together, not hold meand walk.
Leave me.

2000
01:41:56,176 --> 01:41:57,666
How can l leave you?

2001
01:41:58,712 --> 01:42:02,113
A man whose wife has come home after 17 years..

2002
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:05,643
..he is bound to hold her and walk.

2003
01:42:05,986 --> 01:42:07,886
So that she doesn't flee again.

2004
01:42:08,322 --> 01:42:10,256
Come.
- Oh, no!

2005
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:13,169
You're being so mean.

2006
01:42:13,195 --> 01:42:15,551
You don't behave like that even with strangers.

2007
01:42:15,662 --> 01:42:19,029
l'm your husband, after all.

2008
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:22,162
Come. Please come.

2009
01:42:22,188 --> 01:42:23,894
Come. Comeon.

2010
01:42:24,204 --> 01:42:26,229
Come on.

2011
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:30,141
l've come.
Tell me,what do you want to say?. Tell me.

2012
01:42:30,277 --> 01:42:33,542
How did she change all of a sudden?
- Yes.

2013
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:39,251
Aunt, you're here?

2014
01:42:40,087 --> 01:42:41,782
Son, your father had called.

2015
01:42:41,889 --> 01:42:44,016
Father?
But father is notat home.

2016
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:45,350
How is that possible?

2017
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:47,359
He called us home and is not at home himself?.

2018
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:51,055
Aunt, he's not even in this room, let alone at home.
- No.

2019
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:54,327
One minute.
Mother, l think something is fishy.

2020
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:57,001
They don't want us to go in.
- Exactly.

2021
01:42:57,104 --> 01:43:00,471
lf you don't believe us,then come. See it yourself.
- Come on.

2022
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:05,145
Father!
- Dil!

2023
01:43:05,379 --> 01:43:06,846
Kids, you should at least knock before coming in.

2024
01:43:06,947 --> 01:43:08,711
Dil, all this was a drama.

2025
01:43:08,737 --> 01:43:10,635
What you just saw is wrong.

2026
01:43:10,884 --> 01:43:12,146
You can do wrong things..

2027
01:43:12,252 --> 01:43:14,186
..and they can't even see wrong things.
- Get lost!

2028
01:43:14,288 --> 01:43:17,746
Oh, God!
What a trouble!

2029
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:22,557
Dil!
Dil, please! Dil, please listen to me.

2030
01:43:23,063 --> 01:43:25,361
Try to understand me.
Dil, please!

2031
01:43:35,442 --> 01:43:36,704
Look at this, sir.

2032
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:38,504
What have you brought now to see?

2033
01:43:38,612 --> 01:43:41,877
l told you that l've seen those people somewhere.

2034
01:43:41,982 --> 01:43:43,973
Sir,they're from Amritsar.

2035
01:43:47,521 --> 01:43:52,015
The thieves of Amritsar, Rajjo and Pilla, looted an entire bus and fled.

2036
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:55,921
l see.
So this is the matter.

2037
01:43:56,730 --> 01:44:01,497
Those penniless thieves ruined Parminder Singh Pappi's love life.

2038
01:44:01,802 --> 01:44:02,962
They won't get away now.

2039
01:44:03,804 --> 01:44:06,705
That worthless woman's name is Rajjo.

2040
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:11,769
Hello.
- Hello, lnspector Sher Singh.

2041
01:44:11,912 --> 01:44:13,504
Yes, Mr. Parminder Singh.

2042
01:44:13,747 --> 01:44:16,375
l was telling you that she is not my Preeto..

2043
01:44:16,483 --> 01:44:18,280
..but none of you believed me.

2044
01:44:18,518 --> 01:44:21,544
Read the Jagte Raho newspaper of the 16th.

2045
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:24,586
You'll come to know that she's not Preeto..

2046
01:44:24,691 --> 01:44:26,556
..but my Preeto's look alike Rajjo..

2047
01:44:26,693 --> 01:44:28,957
..who's a famous thief of Amritsar.

2048
01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:30,292
Okay, don't worry.

2049
01:44:30,318 --> 01:44:31,646
l'll do something.

2050
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,001
Mr. Satish Kumar, call at the Amritsar control room.

2051
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:42,025
lt's from the police station.

2052
01:44:42,051 --> 01:44:43,533
Hello, lnspector Sher Singh.

2053
01:44:43,577 --> 01:44:45,067
Yes, Mr. Parminder.

2054
01:44:45,178 --> 01:44:48,443
Did you find out?
- l've found out from the Amritsar Police Station.

2055
01:44:48,548 --> 01:44:51,073
lt's true that two thieves have escaped from there..

2056
01:44:51,184 --> 01:44:53,084
..named Rajjo and Pilla.
- Yes!

2057
01:44:53,186 --> 01:44:55,677
l've spoken to lnspector Harnaik Singh.

2058
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:57,654
He'll come to your house tomorrow.

2059
01:44:57,791 --> 01:45:00,055
He'll identify them to confirm if they're the ones.

2060
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,236
Thank you very much.

2061
01:45:01,262 --> 01:45:02,983
- lt's my duty, Mr. Parminder.

2062
01:45:04,364 --> 01:45:06,216
Veer Pratap, that news was right.

2063
01:45:06,242 --> 01:45:07,756
They are Rajjo and Pilla.

2064
01:45:09,036 --> 01:45:12,233
Now that witch Rajjo and Pilla will learn a lesson.

2065
01:45:12,839 --> 01:45:16,741
lnspector Harnaik Singh is coming from Amritsar tomorrow to arrest them.

2066
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:20,811
Until then,we have to behave as if we don't know anything about them.

2067
01:45:25,452 --> 01:45:28,174
Your 5 lakh schemes will get us in trouble some day.

2068
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,072
l'm telling you.

2069
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:31,488
Pack whatever you find and let's leave.

2070
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:33,555
lt's just the matter of a few days.

2071
01:45:33,694 --> 01:45:35,753
Hey!
Where are you taking these things?

2072
01:45:35,862 --> 01:45:36,844
Where will we take them?

2073
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:38,219
We'repacking.
We have to leave.

2074
01:45:38,298 --> 01:45:39,526
You'll always be a thief.

2075
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:42,295
Yes, you rightly said that we're thieves, brother.

2076
01:45:42,402 --> 01:45:44,597
Your father has read the news in the newspaper..

2077
01:45:44,705 --> 01:45:47,765
..that we're thieves fled from Amritsar.
Let's go.

2078
01:45:47,874 --> 01:45:50,809
lnspector Harnaik Singh is coming from Amritsar to identify us.

2079
01:45:50,911 --> 01:45:51,822
He won't identify us.

2080
01:45:51,848 --> 01:45:53,234
He'll just arrest us directly.

2081
01:45:53,313 --> 01:45:55,508
Pilla, let's go.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

2082
01:45:55,649 --> 01:45:57,014
Why should we wait, brother?

2083
01:45:57,117 --> 01:45:58,044
One minute, brother.

2084
01:45:58,070 --> 01:45:59,488
You don't know that inspector.

2085
01:45:59,514 --> 01:46:00,364
Let me tell you.

2086
01:46:00,454 --> 01:46:01,682
He's a weird man.

2087
01:46:01,822 --> 01:46:04,723
ln the month of December, he bathes people in cold water..

2088
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:08,555
..and then makes them lieon iceslabs and eat ice creams.

2089
01:46:08,662 --> 01:46:10,857
Brother, you don't know us yet.

2090
01:46:10,997 --> 01:46:11,657
We'll take care of him.

2091
01:46:11,683 --> 01:46:12,284
- What will you do?

2092
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:13,856
We will do something.
Have patience.

2093
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,695
We won't let anything happen to you. Mani.

2094
01:46:17,237 --> 01:46:18,204
l wonder what they'll do.

2095
01:46:18,305 --> 01:46:20,466
Mani, we'll have to do something or they'll flee.

2096
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:23,338
Yes. What's his name?
- Harnaik Singh.

2097
01:46:31,351 --> 01:46:34,081
Are you sure that the inspector..
- Talk softly.

2098
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:36,189
Are you sure that inspector Harnaik Singh..

2099
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:37,585
..is coming tomorrow morning from Amritsar?

2100
01:46:37,724 --> 01:46:41,285
l'm sure.
l heard father talking on the phone.

2101
01:46:41,428 --> 01:46:44,886
Let's do onething.
As soon as the inspector comes,we'll shoot him.

2102
01:46:44,998 --> 01:46:48,263
No.
We can't shoot a government officer on duty.

2103
01:46:48,368 --> 01:46:51,531
You idiot, l'm talking of shooting father.

2104
01:46:51,671 --> 01:46:53,349
We'll shoot father later.

2105
01:46:53,375 --> 01:46:55,655
Think about Harnaik Singh first.

2106
01:46:56,710 --> 01:46:58,837
ldea!
As soon as the inspector comes..

2107
01:46:58,979 --> 01:47:01,209
..we'll throw him in the lake in the nearby village.

2108
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:03,509
No.
That lake flows to Amritsar.

2109
01:47:03,617 --> 01:47:05,915
lf he swims and reaches home, then he might come back.
- Oh.

2110
01:47:06,019 --> 01:47:08,681
We must think of something to get rid of him for good.

2111
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:12,322
Let's kidnap him on the way.

2112
01:47:12,459 --> 01:47:16,862
Yes.
And after kidnapping him, we'll make our friend Heera..

2113
01:47:16,997 --> 01:47:20,728
..a fake inspector and send him home.
- Yes.

2114
01:47:20,867 --> 01:47:24,564
He'll make Rs. 500 too.
Anyway, drama actors don't get paid too much.

2115
01:47:24,704 --> 01:47:27,172
He'll get his blind mother treated.

2116
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:29,902
He'll get his sick sister married too.
- Young sister.

2117
01:47:30,043 --> 01:47:31,806
Whatever it is,tell me something.

2118
01:47:31,912 --> 01:47:34,847
l hope no one has heard this conversation of ours.

2119
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:38,007
No. No.
Just wait and watch.

2120
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:40,881
Once this is proved a lie..

2121
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:46,353
..l'll dye my father's black beard gray myself.

2122
01:47:54,201 --> 01:47:56,863
l have two sons.
Both are useless.

2123
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:58,697
People say that l'm ill-fated.

2124
01:47:58,839 --> 01:48:01,467
What's my fate's fault?
They are useless.

2125
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:05,407
They are hell bent on proving their father wrong.

2126
01:48:11,885 --> 01:48:12,909
Hello, Minky dear.

2127
01:48:13,053 --> 01:48:14,645
There's no need to call us up.

2128
01:48:14,788 --> 01:48:17,882
l shouldn't call?
But dear, the letter will take very long to deliver.

2129
01:48:18,091 --> 01:48:19,581
lt will be too late by then.

2130
01:48:19,793 --> 01:48:22,091
Dear, it was Gani and Mani's conspiracy the other day.

2131
01:48:22,429 --> 01:48:24,727
Please. Please, on my saying..

2132
01:48:24,965 --> 01:48:26,990
..bring your mother to my house again tomorrow.

2133
01:48:27,267 --> 01:48:30,293
lf l don't show the reality of the fake Preeto to you..

2134
01:48:30,437 --> 01:48:32,405
..then l won't becalled Parminder Singh Tiwana.

2135
01:48:32,539 --> 01:48:35,406
But uncle..- Please.
Please give me one more chance.

2136
01:48:36,276 --> 01:48:39,871
Okay.
l'll try to convince mother.

2137
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:41,344
Let's see what happens.

2138
01:48:41,481 --> 01:48:43,574
Thank you, dear.
- Okay.

2139
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:50,414
Drama actor Heera, l'll teach you a lesson tomorrow.

2140
01:48:50,924 --> 01:48:53,688
l'll show you how a police uniform is worn.

2141
01:48:54,628 --> 01:48:57,961
''Oh, Priyanka!''

2142
01:48:58,064 --> 01:48:59,190
Give me.

2143
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:04,763
Thank you.

2144
01:49:05,939 --> 01:49:07,873
lnspector Harnaik Singh.

2145
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:11,776
What kind of misbehavior is this!
- He slapped him.

2146
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:13,571
He slapped him again.

2147
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:14,796
You were supposed to slap him.

2148
01:49:14,822 --> 01:49:15,639
Why did you slap me?

2149
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:17,808
You were offering him water.
ls he a priest?

2150
01:49:17,951 --> 01:49:20,977
How did you raise your hand on a policeman?
- Like that. Likethat.

2151
01:49:21,087 --> 01:49:23,055
What's this?
Have l come to the right house?

2152
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:24,520
Are you Parminder Singh, brother?

2153
01:49:24,624 --> 01:49:26,093
l am Parminder Singh.

2154
01:49:26,119 --> 01:49:28,915
You tell me, Heera, how's your mother?

2155
01:49:29,095 --> 01:49:31,495
Mother?
My mother is dead.

2156
01:49:31,598 --> 01:49:32,850
Tell me something.

2157
01:49:32,876 --> 01:49:34,615
How's your sick sister?

2158
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:36,301
Sister?
l have no sister.

2159
01:49:36,327 --> 01:49:38,059
My uncle has one daughter.

2160
01:49:38,138 --> 01:49:40,436
So, is your uncle's daughter your sister-in-law?

2161
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:41,732
lsn't she yoursister?

2162
01:49:41,875 --> 01:49:43,206
She is. She is.
- Then? Then?

2163
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:45,870
But l think you have no idea that hitting a policeman..

2164
01:49:46,012 --> 01:49:49,379
..could get you arrested under section 183.

2165
01:49:49,482 --> 01:49:50,782
l see. Tell mesomething.

2166
01:49:50,808 --> 01:49:52,704
Is 420 greater or is 183 greater?

2167
01:49:53,186 --> 01:49:55,211
420 is greater.
- 420 is greater, right? - Yes.

2168
01:49:55,622 --> 01:49:57,522
So,wearing an illegitimate police uniform..

2169
01:49:57,657 --> 01:49:59,215
..can get you arrested under section 420.

2170
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,587
But this is not illegitimate.
lt's legitimate.

2171
01:50:01,695 --> 01:50:02,992
My name is written on it.
Harnaik Singh.

2172
01:50:03,096 --> 01:50:06,088
Veer Pratap, if you minus 183 from 420, what remains?

2173
01:50:06,199 --> 01:50:10,568
420.. 183..
 - 236.- 236.

2174
01:50:10,704 --> 01:50:13,798
Here you go! Here you go!

2175
01:50:14,007 --> 01:50:18,376
The fake Heera of Gani and Mani!
- Help me!

2176
01:50:20,947 --> 01:50:22,346
Move!

2177
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:23,255
l won't spare you!

2178
01:50:23,281 --> 01:50:24,533
- l'll teach you a lesson!

2179
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:27,382
You fake inspector!
Catch him!

2180
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:31,081
ldiot Heera!
He was doing a drama in front of Parminder Singh.

2181
01:50:34,928 --> 01:50:37,158
Aunt, why do you listen to him?

2182
01:50:37,263 --> 01:50:39,356
What nonsense!

2183
01:50:39,466 --> 01:50:40,592
Keep quiet for a minute.

2184
01:50:42,602 --> 01:50:44,027
l'm fed up too, son.

2185
01:50:44,053 --> 01:50:46,119
Everyday we have to come here.

2186
01:50:50,043 --> 01:50:53,069
Mother, at least listen to what uncle has to say.

2187
01:50:53,179 --> 01:50:55,147
There's no need to give him a chance.

2188
01:50:55,448 --> 01:50:58,008
l can give you in writing that as soon as the inspector comes..

2189
01:50:58,118 --> 01:50:59,949
..he too will say that she's not the thief of Amritsar.

2190
01:51:00,086 --> 01:51:04,045
Son, the inspector on the basis of which you can give me in writing..

2191
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:06,352
..whom you admitted in the department yourself..

2192
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:08,393
..l've thrashed him and sent him away long back.

2193
01:51:08,528 --> 01:51:10,826
The real inspector is coming from Amritsar today.

2194
01:51:10,964 --> 01:51:14,923
He's going to arrest your so-called mother.

2195
01:51:15,135 --> 01:51:19,265
lf l don't bring thet ruth to light in front of you today..

2196
01:51:19,372 --> 01:51:20,930
..then l won't becalled Parminder Singh Pappi.

2197
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:22,167
All right, let's see.

2198
01:51:23,076 --> 01:51:24,168
l think he's here.

2199
01:51:33,086 --> 01:51:36,453
Hello, the real inspector Harnaik Singh.
- Hello.

2200
01:51:36,589 --> 01:51:37,886
Hello.

2201
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:40,785
Who's Parminder Singh Chummi?

2202
01:51:40,927 --> 01:51:42,895
Not Chummi.
My name is Pappi.

2203
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:44,114
lt's the samething.

2204
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,852
ls that a respectable name?

2205
01:51:50,136 --> 01:51:51,194
So she's the thief.

2206
01:51:51,337 --> 01:51:53,305
She's not that thief.

2207
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:55,485
She's the thief that stole my heart.

2208
01:51:55,511 --> 01:51:56,291
- What did you say?.

2209
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:57,948
l mean the real thie is inside.

2210
01:51:57,974 --> 01:51:59,495
Veer Pratap, go and get her.

2211
01:51:59,612 --> 01:52:01,239
Who is she?

2212
01:52:01,347 --> 01:52:04,748
She is Mrs. Dilraj Kaur and they are her daughters.

2213
01:52:05,952 --> 01:52:08,011
You roam about with your daughters.

2214
01:52:08,121 --> 01:52:10,555
Look for nice boys for them and get them married.
- What?

2215
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:12,988
Nothing. Nothing.
Bring the thief.

2216
01:52:14,394 --> 01:52:17,852
What happened?
Did you call me, my darling?

2217
01:52:17,997 --> 01:52:20,124
l'm not crazy to call you.

2218
01:52:20,266 --> 01:52:22,200
Give me your blessings.
- Go away!- Okay.

2219
01:52:22,302 --> 01:52:24,202
ldentity your thief and take her away.

2220
01:52:29,809 --> 01:52:30,901
ldentity me.

2221
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:32,136
l've identified her.

2222
01:52:32,278 --> 01:52:33,028
Did you see, Dil?

2223
01:52:33,054 --> 01:52:34,464
l told you that she's a thief.

2224
01:52:34,547 --> 01:52:36,845
She's the lady that fell from a mountain..

2225
01:52:36,983 --> 01:52:39,281
..and lost her memory 17 years ago.

2226
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:41,512
And this man..
You had come to me to lodge a complaint.

2227
01:52:41,654 --> 01:52:42,718
He's the one.
l'm sure.

2228
01:52:42,744 --> 01:52:44,409
- There's no mountain in Amritsar.

2229
01:52:45,024 --> 01:52:47,049
l was reporting in Kangrathen.

2230
01:52:47,193 --> 01:52:50,094
l have just come to know that Kangra was in Punjab 17 years ago.

2231
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:51,595
Should l send you to Kangra?

2232
01:52:51,731 --> 01:52:52,788
What was l saying?

2233
01:52:52,814 --> 01:52:54,281
- You were praising me.

2234
01:52:54,367 --> 01:52:58,997
Yes.
This tiny man took care of that tall lady with great difficulty.

2235
01:52:59,205 --> 01:53:00,801
He didn't get married.

2236
01:53:00,827 --> 01:53:02,495
He kept her with him.

2237
01:53:02,842 --> 01:53:05,276
As his sister. As his sister.

2238
01:53:06,012 --> 01:53:08,446
Brother is not well these days.

2239
01:53:08,581 --> 01:53:11,277
ln spite of suffering from asthma, after she..

2240
01:53:11,417 --> 01:53:12,850
..regained her memory, he brought her to you.

2241
01:53:12,986 --> 01:53:14,783
Where do you find such people these days?

2242
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:16,852
lnspector, you're misunderstanding.

2243
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:18,253
Her photo was published in the newspaper.

2244
01:53:18,358 --> 01:53:21,452
Then you should have called the reporters,why did you call me?

2245
01:53:21,561 --> 01:53:23,756
Look, many other things are published in newspapers.

2246
01:53:23,863 --> 01:53:25,160
They also publish in newspapers that you..

2247
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:26,731
..can increase your height within a month.

2248
01:53:26,866 --> 01:53:29,699
lnspector, false news is published in newspapers too.

2249
01:53:29,936 --> 01:53:31,801
How intelligent!
Who is this boy?.

2250
01:53:31,938 --> 01:53:33,838
My son.
- He's my mistake.

2251
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:36,306
Whatever it is, this case is solved.

2252
01:53:36,409 --> 01:53:38,104
She is not a thief.
- Thank God.

2253
01:53:38,211 --> 01:53:39,529
lnspector, look carefully.

2254
01:53:39,555 --> 01:53:40,466
She's the thief.

2255
01:53:40,547 --> 01:53:44,005
Listen, Paari..
- My name is not Paari. My name is Pappi.

2256
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:46,516
Whatever your name is, tell me something.

2257
01:53:46,653 --> 01:53:48,348
Why do you want to prove that she's a thief?.

2258
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:50,251
l'll tell you, inspector.

2259
01:53:51,257 --> 01:53:53,748
He wants to falsely prove her as a thief..

2260
01:53:53,893 --> 01:53:56,828
..and wants to write on my arm, ''Your mother is a thief.''

2261
01:53:57,330 --> 01:54:02,199
Because if mymother is proved a thief,this man can marry her.

2262
01:54:02,335 --> 01:54:04,963
And l, a young boy, who loves her daughter..

2263
01:54:05,071 --> 01:54:09,030
Who loves her daughte rwearing a yellow dress, can't marry her.

2264
01:54:10,143 --> 01:54:11,235
Hold on.

2265
01:54:11,578 --> 01:54:14,979
lnspector, l think l've seen you somewhere.

2266
01:54:16,382 --> 01:54:18,509
You've seen the whole world!

2267
01:54:18,618 --> 01:54:19,676
Get lost!

2268
01:54:19,786 --> 01:54:20,839
Now listen to me.

2269
01:54:20,865 --> 01:54:22,041
The caseis solved.

2270
01:54:22,121 --> 01:54:24,919
She is your wife.
You can't marry her now.

2271
01:54:25,024 --> 01:54:27,015
Now get the girls married to these boys.

2272
01:54:27,393 --> 01:54:30,123
l mean, get them married to nice boys.

2273
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:32,062
Did you understand, Kissi?

2274
01:54:32,165 --> 01:54:33,652
My name is not Kissi.

2275
01:54:33,678 --> 01:54:35,023
My name is Pappi.

2276
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:37,535
Whoever you are, your name is indecent.

2277
01:54:39,272 --> 01:54:40,466
One minute, brother.

2278
01:54:41,507 --> 01:54:42,735
Since when have policemen started wearing..

2279
01:54:42,842 --> 01:54:43,900
..sports shoes under their uniform?

2280
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:45,136
He's caught.

2281
01:54:45,245 --> 01:54:46,354
l haveto chase thieves.

2282
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,501
Should l wear leather shoes to chase them?

2283
01:54:48,681 --> 01:54:49,739
You don't understand.

2284
01:54:49,849 --> 01:54:52,784
Stop it, Pappi.
I've already wasted our time.

2285
01:54:53,386 --> 01:54:55,115
There's no need to prove anything else now.

2286
01:54:55,255 --> 01:54:56,760
She's not a thief.

2287
01:54:56,786 --> 01:54:58,875
She's a very nice woman.

2288
01:54:58,992 --> 01:55:02,484
She quietly tolerated all the accusations.

2289
01:55:02,595 --> 01:55:05,029
lf it was someone else, she would have taught you a good lesson.

2290
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:08,532
And don't you dare call my sister a thief!

2291
01:55:09,502 --> 01:55:10,696
l'm sorry, sister.

2292
01:55:11,971 --> 01:55:14,667
Now we'll make arrangements for our children's wedding.

2293
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:17,938
Let's go, dear.
Let's go.

2294
01:55:19,212 --> 01:55:20,941
Okay, sister. Bye.

2295
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,480
Bye, sister.
- Bye. - Dil.. - Bye.

2296
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:34,488
Who won't be happyto see young people getting married?

2297
01:55:34,794 --> 01:55:37,524
Come on, now it's time for Harnaik Singh to leave.

2298
01:55:37,630 --> 01:55:40,656
Okay, Buggi, l'll leave.

2299
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,344
My name is not Buggi.

2300
01:55:42,370 --> 01:55:43,692
My name is Paari.

2301
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:47,638
l mean, Chummi.
My name is Kissi. What is my name?

2302
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:49,571
You tell me as a sister.

2303
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:52,002
Mithi.

2304
01:55:58,885 --> 01:56:00,318
What is going on?

2305
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:02,650
When mother gets her love, we lose ours.

2306
01:56:02,755 --> 01:56:04,552
When we get our love, mother loses hers.

2307
01:56:04,691 --> 01:56:07,421
Don't cry.
We'll look for some nice..

2308
01:56:07,527 --> 01:56:08,885
..elderly man for your mother.

2309
01:56:08,911 --> 01:56:09,816
- You're too much.

2310
01:56:09,896 --> 01:56:13,127
We know some nice men.

2311
01:56:13,266 --> 01:56:14,927
One is aretired soldier.

2312
01:56:15,034 --> 01:56:16,865
He drives trucks these days.

2313
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:19,013
He gets his pension as well as his salary.

2314
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:20,226
He makes a lot of money.

2315
01:56:20,306 --> 01:56:24,470
You're troubling us because
we troubled you alot, right?

2316
01:56:24,577 --> 01:56:27,603
No, no.
You did everything for the sake of your mother's love.

2317
01:56:27,714 --> 01:56:30,182
And we did everything for the sake of our mother's love.

2318
01:56:30,717 --> 01:56:32,924
So minus both the mothers.

2319
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:34,803
Andwe'releft.- Yes.

2320
01:56:34,887 --> 01:56:38,914
So, now it's the turn of our love.
- Yes.

2321
01:56:49,869 --> 01:56:52,235
Parminder, act sensibly!
- Sir!

2322
01:56:52,372 --> 01:56:54,045
There are other ways to explain.

2323
01:56:54,071 --> 01:56:55,855
Listen to me.
l'm experienced.

2324
01:56:55,942 --> 01:56:57,315
You've only seen roads!

2325
01:56:57,341 --> 01:56:59,130
l'll show you reality today.

2326
01:56:59,212 --> 01:57:00,777
You'll be hanged if you kill them.

2327
01:57:00,803 --> 01:57:02,035
Your family will be over.

2328
01:57:02,115 --> 01:57:04,675
As if I have a flourishing family now that it will be over!

2329
01:57:04,784 --> 01:57:06,945
Till today, you've seen Parminder Singh Pappi's love.

2330
01:57:07,086 --> 01:57:08,080
You haven't seen his anger.

2331
01:57:08,106 --> 01:57:09,136
You'll see my anger today.

2332
01:57:09,255 --> 01:57:10,347
Pappi, stop!

2333
01:57:10,456 --> 01:57:13,084
''l have a bungalow.''

2334
01:57:13,192 --> 01:57:16,628
''There's a car at the bungalow.''

2335
01:57:16,729 --> 01:57:19,664
Are you my wife?
- Yes.

2336
01:57:19,799 --> 01:57:22,029
When you know that l suffer from high blood pressure..

2337
01:57:22,135 --> 01:57:23,500
..why did you add so much salt in the lentil?

2338
01:57:23,603 --> 01:57:24,857
Why did you add so much salt!

2339
01:57:25,083 --> 01:57:26,222
Why did you add so much salt!

2340
01:57:26,973 --> 01:57:28,531
You're my wife, right?
- Yes.

2341
01:57:28,641 --> 01:57:32,407
When you know that l've come home tired,
who will massage my legs?

2342
01:57:32,512 --> 01:57:33,610
Who will massage my legs?

2343
01:57:33,636 --> 01:57:34,732
- Have you gone crazy?.

2344
01:57:34,814 --> 01:57:35,659
l haven't gone crazy.

2345
01:57:35,685 --> 01:57:36,932
l've come to my senses today.

2346
01:57:37,016 --> 01:57:39,849
l'll bring you to your senses!
- Pilla! Pilla!

2347
01:57:39,986 --> 01:57:41,139
What are you doing?
Let go of her!

2348
01:57:41,165 --> 01:57:41,706
Let go of her!

2349
01:57:41,788 --> 01:57:43,187
l won't spare you today!

2350
01:57:43,289 --> 01:57:45,018
Listen to me!
l'm your brother-in-law!

2351
01:57:45,124 --> 01:57:46,627
Don't call me your brother-in-law!

2352
01:57:46,653 --> 01:57:48,243
Rather, you should be called a dog!

2353
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:49,953
A sister's brother is a dog!

2354
01:57:50,063 --> 01:57:51,746
Leave it! Leaveit!

2355
01:57:51,772 --> 01:57:52,613
Leaveit!

2356
01:57:52,698 --> 01:57:53,756
l won't spare you two today!

2357
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:55,629
Don't shoot!
l'm not your wife!

2358
01:57:55,768 --> 01:57:57,258
lf you're not my wife, then what are you doing here?

2359
01:57:57,370 --> 01:57:59,044
Get out! Get out!

2360
01:57:59,070 --> 01:57:59,955
Get out!

2361
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:01,597
Don't hit me!
- Get out!

2362
01:58:01,741 --> 01:58:03,732
One minute!
At least let us take our luggage!

2363
01:58:03,843 --> 01:58:04,867
Should l give you your luggage?

2364
01:58:04,977 --> 01:58:06,985
Brother, we made a mistake.

2365
01:58:07,011 --> 01:58:08,870
Forgive me. Forgive me.

2366
01:58:08,981 --> 01:58:10,513
My wallet!

2367
01:58:10,539 --> 01:58:13,602
My wallet!
Give me!

2368
01:58:13,686 --> 01:58:17,850
Take this! Take this! Let's go!
- Go! Go!

2369
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:24,563
Father.. Mother.
One minute.

2370
01:58:24,664 --> 01:58:26,495
Father,why did you push our mother?

2371
01:58:26,599 --> 01:58:28,328
l didn't push them. l kicked them.

2372
01:58:28,468 --> 01:58:30,732
lf you sympathize with them, then you'll be kicked too.

2373
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:32,196
Get lost with them!

2374
01:58:32,405 --> 01:58:35,067
l'll assume that as the mother is dead, you both are also dead.

2375
01:58:35,174 --> 01:58:38,200
Let me see who comes in between Dil and me now.

2376
01:58:38,311 --> 01:58:39,801
Father, listen to me!

2377
01:58:39,912 --> 01:58:41,743
Come out, Mr. Tiwana.
- Yes!

2378
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:43,381
Rascal! Scoundrel!

2379
01:58:43,483 --> 01:58:44,541
Mother, did you get hurt?

2380
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:46,584
Don't you dare call me your mother!

2381
01:58:46,686 --> 01:58:49,154
We've saved our lives with great difficulty.

2382
01:58:49,355 --> 01:58:51,186
We won't be ableto do this drama anymore.

2383
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:53,417
Just give us our 5 lakhs, that's it.

2384
01:58:53,526 --> 01:58:55,221
How can we give you the money before the job is done?

2385
01:58:55,328 --> 01:58:57,262
According to the deal, you'll get the money after the wedding.
- Yes.

2386
01:58:57,363 --> 01:59:00,355
We won't get ourselves killed for the sake of your wedding.

2387
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:01,951
Get married on your own.

2388
01:59:01,977 --> 01:59:03,426
Just give us our money.

2389
01:59:03,536 --> 01:59:05,401
Hello.
The wedding won't happen without you.

2390
01:59:05,505 --> 01:59:08,167
And if the wedding doesn't happen, then you won't get anymoney.

2391
01:59:08,274 --> 01:59:10,709
Listen to me, you mama's boy.

2392
01:59:10,735 --> 01:59:13,168
l know how to get my money.

2393
01:59:13,246 --> 01:59:15,339
The blade with which l pick pockets..

2394
01:59:15,448 --> 01:59:17,075
..l can slit people's throats with it too.

2395
01:59:17,216 --> 01:59:17,755
Listen to me!

2396
01:59:17,781 --> 01:59:18,939
How will you take the money?.

2397
01:59:18,965 --> 01:59:19,962
Are you threatening me?

2398
01:59:20,153 --> 01:59:21,209
All right, then.

2399
01:59:21,235 --> 01:59:23,807
Get married on your own.
We're going.

2400
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:24,384
Let's go.

2401
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:26,383
Are wehere to perform their wedding ceremony?
Let's go!

2402
01:59:26,459 --> 01:59:29,451
Listen to me! Listen to me!

2403
01:59:29,896 --> 01:59:31,420
That was bad.

2404
01:59:31,564 --> 01:59:33,998
What will we do now?

2405
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:38,300
Before father creates any more problems, we'll have to do something.

2406
01:59:38,404 --> 01:59:41,305
We will snatch..
- Our rights. - Mybrother.

2407
01:59:45,578 --> 01:59:47,045
Brother,what do we do now?

2408
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:48,941
Yoursisters..

2409
01:59:49,949 --> 01:59:52,213
l mean they're roaming with those boys..

2410
01:59:52,318 --> 01:59:54,252
..because of whom you landed in the hospital.

2411
01:59:54,587 --> 01:59:58,216
And brother, if the property is like Gani and Mani,

2412
01:59:58,324 --> 02:00:00,849
then it is gone from our hands.

2413
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,291
Don't talk nonsense.

2414
02:00:03,629 --> 02:00:08,589
l've thought about how to get Minky and Rinky married to you two.

2415
02:00:08,701 --> 02:00:10,603
They've kept all my sweaters.

2416
02:00:10,629 --> 02:00:12,924
They didn't let us take anything.

2417
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:15,303
You idiot!
You're concerned about your sweater?

2418
02:00:15,441 --> 02:00:17,272
They threw us out of their house without letting us eat anything.

2419
02:00:17,376 --> 02:00:20,140
See how thin l've gon ein just on day.

2420
02:00:20,246 --> 02:00:21,312
You have become so slim.

2421
02:00:21,338 --> 02:00:23,069
May no one cast an evil eye upon you.

2422
02:00:23,149 --> 02:00:24,980
Are you satisfied now?

2423
02:00:25,117 --> 02:00:27,210
You were thinking of looting them.

2424
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:31,017
You were about to be slapped because of that.

2425
02:00:31,123 --> 02:00:34,115
Now l will slap them.

2426
02:00:34,227 --> 02:00:34,905
What's the matter?

2427
02:00:34,931 --> 02:00:36,777
 Are you thinking of taking interest from them?

2428
02:00:36,862 --> 02:00:40,263
Not interest!
Revenge! l'll take revenge!

2429
02:00:40,499 --> 02:00:43,696
That too not from Gani and Mani, but from Rinky and Minky.

2430
02:00:43,803 --> 02:00:47,170
Enough!
You're thinking of taking revenge on Rinky and Minky.

2431
02:00:47,306 --> 02:00:49,900
You'll get me killed someday.

2432
02:00:50,543 --> 02:00:52,101
Get us tea!

2433
02:00:54,247 --> 02:00:55,839
Why do you want to take revenge on Rinky and Minky?

2434
02:00:55,948 --> 02:00:57,245
Did they open your hair and flee?

2435
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:59,116
Hey!
What are you saying?

2436
02:00:59,142 --> 02:01:01,402
She's like your sister-in-law.

2437
02:01:01,487 --> 02:01:02,625
You're joking with her?

2438
02:01:02,651 --> 02:01:03,343
Who are you?

2439
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:06,289
Are you talking about Dilraj Kaur's daughters?

2440
02:01:06,592 --> 02:01:08,890
Yes.

2441
02:01:09,262 --> 02:01:11,730
So, theene my's enemy is your friend.

2442
02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:14,396
Come on.
Let's have tea.

2443
02:01:14,533 --> 02:01:15,636
You scoundrel!

2444
02:01:15,662 --> 02:01:18,892
Don't fall for my looks! l'll kill you!

2445
02:01:18,971 --> 02:01:20,345
Come, sister.
Let's have tea together.

2446
02:01:20,371 --> 02:01:21,021
Let's sit there.

2447
02:01:22,141 --> 02:01:24,163
But why are you asking for 5 lakhs?

2448
02:01:24,189 --> 02:01:25,863
You look like their mother.

2449
02:01:26,112 --> 02:01:30,208
lf you want, you can be the sole owner of their property.
- How?

2450
02:01:30,316 --> 02:01:31,749
l have a scheme in mind.

2451
02:01:32,451 --> 02:01:33,577

2472
02:01:42,028 --> 02:01:43,325
Hello, Parminder Singh speaking.

2473
02:01:43,429 --> 02:01:45,426
Brother Pappi, do you have aminute?

2474
02:01:45,452 --> 02:01:47,447
l need to give you some bad news.

2475
02:01:47,533 --> 02:01:49,000
Who's speaking?

2476
02:01:49,101 --> 02:01:52,502
l'm your well-wisher, brother Pappi.

2477
02:01:52,605 --> 02:01:55,005
What kind of a well-wisher gives bad news?

2478
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:58,570
l just saw your two dear sons kidnapping Dilraj Kaur.

2479
02:02:03,549 --> 02:02:05,092
You saw them kidnapping her?

2480
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:06,771
What nonsense are you talking?

2481
02:02:06,852 --> 02:02:09,946
Brother Pappi, you're trying to be so innocent.

2482
02:02:10,089 --> 02:02:14,150
Don't you know?
The secret of the fake mother has been revealed.

2483
02:02:14,293 --> 02:02:18,093
Now he'll tell everything to Dilraj Kaur that she was a fake.

2484
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:22,894
So he'll get married to her.
That's why.

2485
02:02:23,035 --> 02:02:24,068
How dare they!

2486
02:02:24,094 --> 02:02:26,086
l won't spare them today.

2487
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:29,164
That's it.
Thats what they were saying too, brother Pappi.

2488
02:02:29,275 --> 02:02:31,829
''We won't spare our lover father.

2489
02:02:31,855 --> 02:02:34,033
We'll teach him a lesson.''

2490
02:02:34,113 --> 02:02:35,410
Time will tell.

2491
02:02:37,817 --> 02:02:39,045
There you go!

2492
02:02:39,151 --> 02:02:41,004
Okay. l'ved one my job.

2493
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:44,011
Now you call the boys.
- One minute.

2494
02:02:44,123 --> 02:02:46,023
Yes. Okay. Okay.

2495
02:02:48,861 --> 02:02:52,126
Hello.
- Your father has kidnapped the girls.

2496
02:02:52,231 --> 02:02:54,631
What? - He was also saying that if the girls are killed..

2497
02:02:54,734 --> 02:02:56,725
..then there'll be no marriage at all.

2498
02:02:56,869 --> 02:02:59,736
This means the root cause of the problem will be over.

2499
02:02:59,872 --> 02:03:00,964
Hello.

2500
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:04,067
The father-in-law has kidnapped his daughters-in-law.

2501
02:03:06,278 --> 02:03:07,836
What do we do about this man?

2502
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:09,948
Just because he's given birth to us, he calls himself our father.

2503
02:03:10,049 --> 02:03:11,414
lf we knew that our father would be like that..

2504
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:12,983
..we would have strangled him as soon as we were born.

2505
02:03:13,085 --> 02:03:14,902
lt's strange.
He's an old man.

2506
02:03:14,928 --> 02:03:17,410
He should see his sons getting married.

2507
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:18,383
He should play with his grandchildren.

2508
02:03:18,409 --> 02:03:18,948
- Let's go see today.

2509
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:42,172
They've come. They've come.

2510
02:03:44,517 --> 02:03:45,609
Has anyone come?

2511
02:03:46,552 --> 02:03:47,951
Slowly.

2512
02:03:52,158 --> 02:03:54,217
Father has chosen a dirty place just like he is.

2513
02:03:55,561 --> 02:03:57,426
Dirty father!
- What are you doing?

2514
02:03:58,164 --> 02:04:00,189
Have weever got anything that we've asked for, from father?

2515
02:04:00,699 --> 02:04:01,791
No.
- Then?

2516
02:04:01,901 --> 02:04:04,369
We'll have to get the girls out on the sly.

2517
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:07,136
Yes. - Yes.
Let's go.

2518
02:04:15,181 --> 02:04:16,808
Pappi, careful.

2519
02:04:20,586 --> 02:04:21,701
What are you waiting for?

2520
02:04:21,727 --> 02:04:23,375
Call out to those sons of an idiot!

2521
02:04:23,489 --> 02:04:25,423
Mind your language.
- You felt bad?

2522
02:04:25,558 --> 02:04:26,582
l will feel bad.

2523
02:04:26,692 --> 02:04:28,717
lf they are sons of an idiot, then that means l am an idiot.

2524
02:04:28,861 --> 02:04:32,922
Oh!
- They're not so innocent to come out on one call.

2525
02:04:33,065 --> 02:04:34,272
Come. Come. Come.

2526
02:04:34,298 --> 02:04:35,718
- Come on. Comeon.

2527
02:04:41,207 --> 02:04:43,232
Keep quiet.
- Look ahead.

2528
02:04:43,309 --> 02:04:44,196
This won't help.

2529
02:04:44,222 --> 02:04:47,327
They won't do anything even if they come face to face.

2530
02:04:47,546 --> 02:04:49,070
We'll have to give them weapons.

2531
02:04:49,215 --> 02:04:50,546
You'reright.

2532
02:04:57,089 --> 02:04:59,489
Where have they brought my Dil?

2533
02:04:59,725 --> 02:05:01,659
l think it's the third model.

2534
02:05:02,428 --> 02:05:03,690
Talk with respect.

2535
02:05:03,929 --> 02:05:04,944
Why are you getting angry?

2536
02:05:04,970 --> 02:05:06,218
l'm talking about the vehicle.

2537
02:05:06,332 --> 02:05:08,300
l see. l thought you were talking about Dil.

2538
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:11,130
Because Dil was born on the3rd.
- Oh.

2539
02:05:17,042 --> 02:05:18,634
Follow me. Slowly.

2540
02:05:22,448 --> 02:05:24,143
A gun.
- Oh, my!

2541
02:05:24,650 --> 02:05:25,878
Leaveit!

2542
02:05:27,286 --> 02:05:29,186
lt's our enemy father's conspiracyto frame us.

2543
02:05:29,288 --> 02:05:30,983
Our finger prints will come on it.

2544
02:05:31,223 --> 02:05:32,383
Never mind.

2545
02:05:38,898 --> 02:05:40,086
They do this in movies too.

2546
02:05:40,112 --> 02:05:41,255
Your brain works.
- Yes.

2547
02:05:41,333 --> 02:05:42,527
Does this work?

2548
02:05:42,868 --> 02:05:43,926
Do you want to kill me?

2549
02:05:44,403 --> 02:05:47,167
Over there.
- Then they will kill each other.

2550
02:05:56,448 --> 02:05:58,245
l think a poor man must have dropped it.

2551
02:06:02,488 --> 02:06:03,648
Look there.

2552
02:06:05,124 --> 02:06:08,457
Oh, God!
Our father has stooped so low?

2553
02:06:08,661 --> 02:06:10,424
Along with the girls, he kidnapped aunt as well.

2554
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:12,463
To marry her forcefully.

2555
02:06:12,565 --> 02:06:15,227
Why do we care?
lf aunt is here, then the girls must be here too.

2556
02:06:15,367 --> 02:06:16,595
Yes.
- Lets look for them.

2557
02:06:18,671 --> 02:06:20,935
What happened?
They kidnapped the girls too.

2558
02:06:22,141 --> 02:06:24,507
l think they want to marry them forcefully.

2559
02:06:24,610 --> 02:06:25,668
Come on, let's release them.

2560
02:06:25,778 --> 02:06:26,743
They're not running away.

2561
02:06:26,769 --> 02:06:27,771
We'll release them later.

2562
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:29,643
Let me look for Dil first.

2563
02:06:29,782 --> 02:06:33,946
We'll take aunt on gunpoint and ask father to release Rinky and Minky.

2564
02:06:34,486 --> 02:06:35,612
Let's go.

2565
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:39,251
Hello, aunt.
- Hello.

2566
02:06:39,858 --> 02:06:42,190
Aunt, forgive us. Our father has stooped very low.

2567
02:06:42,294 --> 02:06:44,922
Along with you, he has kidnapped Rinky and Minky as well.

2568
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:46,088
You know what we're going to do?

2569
02:06:46,198 --> 02:06:47,529
We're going to take you on gunpoint..

2570
02:06:47,633 --> 02:06:49,100
..and get Rinky and Minky released from father.

2571
02:06:49,234 --> 02:06:51,429
Aunt, l hope you'll forgive this mistake of ours..

2572
02:06:51,537 --> 02:06:53,164
..that we're making to get the girls released.

2573
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:55,664
What?.

2574
02:06:55,808 --> 02:06:56,934
What..

2575
02:06:57,443 --> 02:06:58,452
Aunt,we'll eat later.

2576
02:06:58,478 --> 02:07:00,494
Let's release the girls first.
Open her.

2577
02:07:01,547 --> 02:07:04,107
You'regoing through all this because ofmy useless sons.

2578
02:07:04,216 --> 02:07:05,808
l apologize to you on behalf of them.

2579
02:07:05,918 --> 02:07:08,682
And l'll have to apologize to you for something in advance.

2580
02:07:08,787 --> 02:07:12,154
Because now, l'm going to take you on gunpoint to release your mother.

2581
02:07:12,591 --> 02:07:13,819
Look at them.
They're refusing.

2582
02:07:13,926 --> 02:07:15,826
Can't you do this for your mother?

2583
02:07:16,762 --> 02:07:17,888
Open them quickly.

2584
02:07:18,063 --> 02:07:19,547
Keep quiet.
Why are you screaming?

2585
02:07:19,573 --> 02:07:20,488
- l'm opening them.

2586
02:07:21,433 --> 02:07:22,957
They're untying them.

2587
02:07:23,102 --> 02:07:24,660
An emotional scene is going on.

2588
02:07:26,839 --> 02:07:28,898
l think they'll fight later.

2589
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:45,188
Father, if you want to see aunt alive,then send the girls to us.

2590
02:07:45,324 --> 02:07:49,055
And if you want to see the girls alive,
then give my Dil back to me.

2591
02:07:49,161 --> 02:07:50,822
We didn't expect this from you.

2592
02:07:50,963 --> 02:07:53,090
But l had expected this from you two.

2593
02:07:53,932 --> 02:07:56,264
l proved your mother fake..

2594
02:07:56,368 --> 02:07:58,859
..and you stooped so low that you kidnapped my Dil?

2595
02:07:59,071 --> 02:08:01,767
l see.
You'rethe culprit and you're accusing us?

2596
02:08:01,874 --> 02:08:03,042
We didn't kidnap aunt.

2597
02:08:03,068 --> 02:08:04,766
You kidnapped Rinky and Minky.

2598
02:08:04,877 --> 02:08:07,869
Am l crazy to kidnap my daughters?

2599
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:09,174
Your daughters?

2600
02:08:10,683 --> 02:08:12,446
Father, don't make me laugh.

2601
02:08:12,951 --> 02:08:16,079
Were you taking them shopping on gunpoint?

2602
02:08:16,188 --> 02:08:18,986
Were you taking my Dil to operate on someone..

2603
02:08:19,091 --> 02:08:21,389
..putting a green doctor's mask on her mouth?

2604
02:08:22,494 --> 02:08:25,190
Gani and Mani, should l
shoot him if you say?

2605
02:08:25,216 --> 02:08:25,977
- Who is he?

2606
02:08:26,098 --> 02:08:27,292
Very good.

2607
02:08:27,966 --> 02:08:29,194
You've called goons.

2608
02:08:29,301 --> 02:08:30,962
No, no.
They're not our goons.

2609
02:08:31,103 --> 02:08:32,866
lf they're not your goons,
then are they your father's goons?

2610
02:08:33,005 --> 02:08:34,063
Pappi sir.
- Yes.

2611
02:08:34,173 --> 02:08:36,437
lf they're irritating you, should we kill them?

2612
02:08:36,642 --> 02:08:39,202
l see.
So you have called the goons.

2613
02:08:39,311 --> 02:08:40,437
No.

2614
02:08:40,779 --> 02:08:43,001
Just watch.
Now they'll fight.

2615
02:08:43,027 --> 02:08:44,433
- We'll have fun.

2616
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:45,605
l won't spare you today.

2617
02:08:45,631 --> 02:08:47,169
l won't spare you today.
Shut up!

2618
02:08:47,286 --> 02:08:49,345
Really? You'll hit us? Go ahead.

2619
02:08:49,488 --> 02:08:50,512
What will you do?

2620
02:08:50,656 --> 02:08:52,476
Look, don't force us.

2621
02:08:52,502 --> 02:08:54,412
- What will you do?

2622
02:08:54,526 --> 02:08:55,788
What will you do?

2623
02:08:55,928 --> 02:08:58,761
You don't know what l'm capable of doing.

2624
02:08:58,897 --> 02:09:02,230
We too don't know what we'recapable of doing.
- Yes.

2625
02:09:02,334 --> 02:09:05,792
Fight. Or we'll have to pay the goons unnecessarily.
- Yes.

2626
02:09:05,904 --> 02:09:07,667
You'll regret, Parminder Singh.

2627
02:09:07,773 --> 02:09:09,104
You're threatening your father!

2628
02:09:09,241 --> 02:09:10,387
Oh! So you'll hit us! Go ahead!

2629
02:09:10,413 --> 02:09:11,632
Go ahead!
- Go ahead! Go ahead!

2630
02:09:11,744 --> 02:09:13,268
l would have hit you.

2631
02:09:13,946 --> 02:09:16,915
When l had fever, if you had not
kept a cold cloth on my forehead..

2632
02:09:17,015 --> 02:09:20,007
..l would have taught you two a lesson today!

2633
02:09:20,152 --> 02:09:22,586
When we were little..

2634
02:09:22,721 --> 02:09:26,054
..if you hadn't stayed awake at nights and sent us to pee..

2635
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:28,989
lfl hadn't made you pee, you would have wet the mattress!

2636
02:09:29,094 --> 02:09:31,085
At least let me complete!

2637
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:33,725
lt's been two hours since this drama.

2638
02:09:33,866 --> 02:09:34,865
Do whatever you have to quickly.

2639
02:09:34,891 --> 02:09:35,358
l have to go.

2640
02:09:35,467 --> 02:09:36,525
Where do you have to go?

2641
02:09:36,635 --> 02:09:37,829
l have to see the world.

2642
02:09:37,936 --> 02:09:39,181
l'll deal with them later.

2643
02:09:39,207 --> 02:09:40,691
l'll show you the world first.

2644
02:09:40,806 --> 02:09:42,569
l don't think they'll do anything.

2645
02:09:42,674 --> 02:09:43,463
We'll have to go.

2646
02:09:43,489 --> 02:09:45,065
- l think we should let it be.

2647
02:09:45,144 --> 02:09:48,511
Let's go.
- Let's go.- Stop threatening me.

2648
02:09:48,647 --> 02:09:50,171
Come here!
- Are you scared?

2649
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:54,750
Comeon!
- You won't come ahead.

2650
02:09:54,853 --> 02:09:56,821
Try messing with us.

2651
02:09:56,847 --> 02:09:58,814
Come on. Shoot me.

2652
02:09:58,924 --> 02:10:00,084
Who shot?.

2653
02:10:02,261 --> 02:10:04,252
Stop this drama!

2654
02:10:05,464 --> 02:10:09,400
So much time a truck driver must have
not spent on the seat of the truck..

2655
02:10:09,535 --> 02:10:11,594
..that you guys have made us spend below the truck.

2656
02:10:11,703 --> 02:10:12,761
Mother, you?

2657
02:10:12,871 --> 02:10:14,771
Shutup, you mama's boy!

2658
02:10:14,907 --> 02:10:18,308
We made so many schemes so that you fight with each other.

2659
02:10:18,443 --> 02:10:22,106
And then, our goons will kill this man with a yellow turban.

2660
02:10:22,247 --> 02:10:23,992
Everyone knows that l'm his wife.

2661
02:10:24,018 --> 02:10:25,708
l would get all the property.

2662
02:10:25,818 --> 02:10:27,581
And then these boys would be shot and..

2663
02:10:27,719 --> 02:10:30,279
..the girls would be married off.

2664
02:10:30,422 --> 02:10:32,890
Dolu would get the property of the girls.

2665
02:10:33,025 --> 02:10:34,676
But you all are useless!

2666
02:10:34,702 --> 02:10:37,316
You're not fighting with each other!

2667
02:10:38,130 --> 02:10:40,291
Will you give away all the information alone?

2668
02:10:40,432 --> 02:10:42,593
Dolu is standing here useless.
- Shut up!

2669
02:10:42,701 --> 02:10:43,827
lt's over now.

2670
02:10:44,136 --> 02:10:47,071
Till today, l'veonly picked pockets.

2671
02:10:47,172 --> 02:10:49,299
Today l'll kill you all.

2672
02:10:49,441 --> 02:10:51,534
One minute, sister. Please.
One minute.

2673
02:10:52,244 --> 02:10:53,729
Dil, did you hearthe truth?

2674
02:10:53,755 --> 02:10:55,898
She is a thief.
She is not their mother.

2675
02:10:56,014 --> 02:10:57,208
Marry me now.

2676
02:10:57,316 --> 02:10:59,341
l wonder what you're made of.

2677
02:10:59,451 --> 02:11:01,419
We'reat gunpoint and you're thinking about your marriage.

2678
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,053
Listen to me carefully.

2679
02:11:03,079 --> 02:11:04,810
Whatever l may be made of..

2680
02:11:04,923 --> 02:11:06,515
..l will marry Dil at any cost.

2681
02:11:06,658 --> 02:11:08,785
First take care of those who you've given birth to.

2682
02:11:08,894 --> 02:11:10,156
You are readyto givebirth to new ones.

2683
02:11:10,262 --> 02:11:11,912
Stop this nuisance!

2684
02:11:11,938 --> 02:11:13,848
And get ready to die!

2685
02:11:13,966 --> 02:11:14,433
We're ready!

2686
02:11:14,459 --> 02:11:15,822
Do you want us to wear saris now?

2687
02:11:15,901 --> 02:11:17,926
l won't spare you today, Pappi!

2688
02:11:20,005 --> 02:11:21,165
Hands up!

2689
02:11:21,974 --> 02:11:23,965
Father!

2690
02:11:25,143 --> 02:11:26,508
Mani!

2691
02:11:29,414 --> 02:11:30,540
You..
- Gani!

2692
02:11:36,021 --> 02:11:37,613
Catch them!

2693
02:12:12,391 --> 02:12:13,642
Sons, open up my hands.

2694
02:12:13,668 --> 02:12:14,646
l'm your mother.

2695
02:12:14,726 --> 02:12:16,734
l'll open up your head.

2696
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:17,982
You shot me.

2697
02:12:18,063 --> 02:12:20,691
l was unnecessarily trying to be a villain.

2698
02:12:20,832 --> 02:12:22,993
l thought l would usurp aunt's property.

2699
02:12:23,101 --> 02:12:25,194
Now l feel my own property will be sold.

2700
02:12:25,337 --> 02:12:27,060
You look likea butcher.

2701
02:12:27,086 --> 02:12:28,957
You talk like an animal.

2702
02:12:29,041 --> 02:12:31,236
Brother, should we consider that
the marriage is not going to happen.

2703
02:12:31,343 --> 02:12:33,573
Let them say so.

2704
02:12:36,048 --> 02:12:38,753
Sister, please tell me when Lahore arrives.

2705
02:12:38,779 --> 02:12:40,032
l haveto get down.

2706
02:12:40,118 --> 02:12:43,144
l had asked Babar to meet Akbar, but he refused.

2707
02:12:43,288 --> 02:12:45,035
He gets along with Shah Jahan.

2708
02:12:45,061 --> 02:12:47,215
Tulsidas's passport isn't made yet.

2709
02:12:47,326 --> 02:12:49,055
Pilla has gone crazy.

2710
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:55,691
''l'm finished.
My husband has gone crazy!''

2711
02:12:55,801 --> 02:12:57,792
Son, are you all right?
- Yes.

2712
02:12:58,103 --> 02:12:59,659
Son, what were you about to do?

2713
02:12:59,685 --> 02:13:01,791
You were ready to get killed to save me?

2714
02:13:02,975 --> 02:13:05,203
Father, we've already lost mother.

2715
02:13:05,229 --> 02:13:06,800
We can't lose you now.

2716
02:13:06,912 --> 02:13:07,789
What are you saying?

2717
02:13:07,815 --> 02:13:09,337
- We are saying the right thing.

2718
02:13:09,614 --> 02:13:12,742
We know how much you've suffered while raising us.

2719
02:13:12,884 --> 02:13:14,749
Father, for your sake, we can sacrifice our lives not just once..

2720
02:13:14,853 --> 02:13:16,081
..but several times.

2721
02:13:16,488 --> 02:13:19,685
Parminder Singh Pappi is so fortunate.

2722
02:13:20,359 --> 02:13:21,576
l have two sons.

2723
02:13:21,602 --> 02:13:22,818
Both are gems.

2724
02:13:22,995 --> 02:13:25,122
Son, please forgive me if you can.

2725
02:13:25,497 --> 02:13:29,297
All my life, l couldn't understand that you love me so much.

2726
02:13:29,534 --> 02:13:30,694
Father..

2727
02:13:31,803 --> 02:13:35,000
He wants to say that we love those two as well.

2728
02:13:36,274 --> 02:13:39,801
lf that's the case,then no one will come between your love now.

2729
02:13:41,513 --> 02:13:43,879
Take care of her.

2730
02:13:44,483 --> 02:13:45,643
God bless you.

2731
02:13:46,852 --> 02:13:47,989
What about me?

2732
02:13:48,015 --> 02:13:50,369
Half is gone, half is left.

2733
02:13:51,523 --> 02:13:52,656
Love you, father.

2734
02:13:52,682 --> 02:13:53,948
- Thank you, son.

2735
02:13:54,659 --> 02:13:55,956
Listen to me.

2736
02:13:57,763 --> 02:14:01,824
Look, son, after your marriage, Rinky and Minky will come home.

2737
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:04,068
But Dil will stay alone over there.

2738
02:14:04,536 --> 02:14:08,131
l was thinking if she too could come here and live with us..

2739
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:10,437
Father!

2740
02:14:10,575 --> 02:14:12,270
l've seen this scene for the first time.

2741
02:14:12,477 --> 02:14:14,104
Though l have seen the world.
