1
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,438
We could have all died today.

2
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:47,522
I'll send Di (sister) back
to the US tomorrow.

3
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:51,272
You, Shozi
and Arfa stay away from this.

4
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,355
I'll handle Pali.

5
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:57,730
He attacked Di, Rohan.

6
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:00,688
I'll first kill his brother.

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,105
Then him.

8
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,480
We will have to do something.

9
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,355
- Kill him.
- You can't beat him.

10
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:11,772
Pali will stop him.

11
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:14,605
And for how long will we keep running?

12
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:18,230
We will have to do something now.

13
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:21,022
What do you mean?

14
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:24,480
I mean we have to stop
this cunt somehow.

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,397
Anyhow.

16
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,938
And whatever we do,
we'll do it together.

17
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:32,022
- But Rohan...
- You were right.

18
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:35,605
We will have to send Di
and Arfa far away from here.

19
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,105
Maybe even Shozi.

20
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:39,563
Arfa's not gonna understand.

21
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:47,313
I am the one who started this
and I am the one who will end it.

22
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:49,313
Don't get involved.

23
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,688
You don't get involved in this.

24
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:52,813
Please.

25
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:56,730
Don't get involved?

26
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,813
Whether we want it or not,
we are all involved in it.

27
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:10,980
But I don't want to
lose you like I did Krish.

28
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:15,980
That's why I am telling you,
whatever we do, we'll do it together.

29
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:19,397
But we will do it properly,
we will think it through.

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,272
Let's finish this.

31
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:49,563
My boys have been looking for
you all over and you came here?!

32
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:54,813
I need a favor from you.

33
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:59,938
I wouldn't give you and Sunny
death even if you beg for it.

34
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:02,272
- I'll have you two...
- Pali, listen to me.

35
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:05,355
Leave us alone.

36
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:07,480
Please.

37
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,730
I'll take Sunny and
we'll go somewhere far away.

38
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:14,063
We will never come before you again.

39
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,480
Promise.

40
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:20,147
Whatever that happened was wrong.

41
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:22,480
I agree to that.

42
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:26,605
But we can't stop that.

43
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,855
Give me a chance, please.

44
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:35,938
You guys started this
buy attacking my brother.

45
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:38,105
And I will end this.

46
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:40,313
And I will end this soon.

47
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,230
We didn't start this, Pali.

48
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:47,272
Your brother Kuljinder started this.

49
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:54,647
We lost many things in this fight, Pali.

50
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:58,772
But I lost more than you ever will.

51
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,813
- Sanober.
- Yes Pali.

52
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,688
Did you know Kulli had forced
himself on a ten-year-old boy?

53
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:25,980
Did you know that he
used to do that to kids?

54
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,313
Tell me.

55
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:36,730
Tell me!

56
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:39,730
I knew.

57
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,063
Tell me.

58
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,563
Do you know why are we here?

59
00:04:58,313 --> 00:04:59,022
Quiet.

60
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:00,980
Rohan! Hey, Rohan!

61
00:05:02,938 --> 00:05:03,938
Are you alright?

62
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,480
Yeah.

63
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:17,938
I am not fine either.

64
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:20,688
Let's play ping-pong.

65
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:24,272
Sunny?

66
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:28,438
There's a time for everything.

67
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:30,397
And it's time for ping-pong now.

68
00:05:31,313 --> 00:05:32,355
I'll serve.

69
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:41,813
I blame myself everyday,
for Krish and Mahi's death.

70
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:53,688
Come on, Rohan.

71
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:05,355
I wish forgiving someone
was easier than blaming someone.

72
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:09,397
We always keep blaming ourselves.

73
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:14,980
But the fact is,
that Krish and Mahi are dead.

74
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,605
Since the past two years,
I keep thinking about just one thing.

75
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,813
I wish it were the other way around.

76
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:32,855
Krish should have survived
and I should have died.

77
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:48,147
And every day, I keep thinking
that I wish hadn't told you anything.

78
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,522
Then why did you?

79
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,813
Why did you tell me, Rohan?

80
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:04,063
You know I'm like a matchstick
in a gunpowder factory.

81
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,147
And yet, you told me such a thing.

82
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:09,438
I know.

83
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,438
Have you lost your freakin' mind?

84
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,897
Where did you get this from?

85
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,938
- Relax. Relax.
- Motherfucker.

86
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:22,272
Relax?

87
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:25,480
This time we will go fully prepared.
There will be no fuck ups.

88
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:28,355
- Let me have that.
- Why?

89
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:30,855
For safety. Let me have that.

90
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:33,522
You think that I am crazy, don't you?

91
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,188
Yes.

92
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:37,855
Yes.

93
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,147
Everyone thinks so.

94
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:44,772
The pain inside me
doesn't heal, Rohan.

95
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,147
And it won't heal till
I don't get Pali punished.

96
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:56,647
Okay, fine.

97
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,230
But let go. Give me the...

98
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:07,938
You can take it tomorrow,
when we come back here to kill Jassi.

99
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:09,397
Let me have it in the meanwhile.

100
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:11,397
Okay?

101
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:20,730
- Rohan?
- Yes.

102
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:24,688
Don't come with me tomorrow,
if you don't want to.

103
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:27,772
I'll totally understand.
It's totally okay.

104
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:29,063
No, I'll come with you tomorrow.

105
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:32,313
You won't go alone, I'll come.

106
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:38,605
- Okay.
- Okay.

107
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,313
Where are you going?

108
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:46,563
We go together tomorrow.

109
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:48,480
Today I go alone, to the washroom.

110
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:04,522
Hey. Hey, Di.

111
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:07,022
Rohan, I'm with Dr. Pandey.
Are you alone?

112
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:08,730
Oh hello, doctor. Yeah.

113
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,272
Is everything set for tomorrow?

114
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:12,813
We cannot admit someone
without proper consent...

115
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:15,605
...but I know that this is a special case.

116
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,855
You can get him.
We will manage it.

117
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:19,688
Our centre is quite well-equipped.

118
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:22,272
I'll make some excuse and
bring him to the centre tomorrow.

119
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:26,063
We might have to lock him up.
We may have to sedate him.

120
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:28,730
Lock him? We'll have
to lock in here at the centre?

121
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:31,438
So, I'll... Di... Di, don't worry.

122
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,355
I'll stay there as long as it takes.

123
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:36,313
Rohan, you will be with him, right?

124
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:37,480
Yes.

125
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,730
This is the only option left.

126
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:43,730
It will take some time.

127
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:44,772
But...

128
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,813
- Oh, shit!
- Hello, Rohan?

129
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,355
What happened?

130
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:53,313
- I'll call you back.
- Rohan?

131
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,397
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

132
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:10,313
Come on Sunny, pick up.

133
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:11,730
Pick up the fuckin' phone.

134
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:22,647
Come on. Pick up the phone.

135
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:38,647
Shit! Fuck!

136
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,105
Shit...

137
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,688
Fuck!

138
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:13,230
Man, what the fuck.

139
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,938
Get the fuck off.

140
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:23,355
Get the fuck off.

141
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:42,522
Sunny!

142
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:44,105
No!

143
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:49,522
Don't.

144
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,355
I'll take both of you.

145
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:30,480
Jassi has...

146
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:32,897
Let it be, Pali.

147
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:35,897
Why do you want to see it?

148
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,480
I'll send you a picture.

149
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:03,980
Is it enough?

150
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,688
Should I disconnect...

151
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:08,563
Don't disconnect the call, Sukhi!

152
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:11,438
Make it quick, Pali.

153
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:14,022
Let me see.

154
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:17,063
Let me watch it.

155
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:24,022
Jassi was your responsibility, Sukhi.

156
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:27,397
I'm going to get out
and kill those two bastards.

157
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:32,897
But before that,
I'll fuckin' kill you! I'll kill you!

158
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,563
What have I done?

159
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:37,813
Jassi!

160
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,813
What have I done... what the fuck!

161
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:54,230
You know you don't have to do this.

162
00:13:56,397 --> 00:13:58,438
I can't believe I have
To explain this to you, Rohan.

163
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,438
You can still walk away.
There is still a chance.

164
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:03,355
- It's okay too late.
- Not anymore.

165
00:14:05,853 --> 00:14:07,772
Di's already taken a flight back.

166
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:12,938
You too should go be with your father.

167
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:50,230
What time?

168
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:52,688
Alright, thanks.

169
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,063
Pali's out.

170
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:55,230
Pali, why did you escape from jail?

171
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:57,063
The police came looking for you.

172
00:17:57,522 --> 00:17:58,897
They will come back.

173
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,980
You should leave.

174
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:03,522
Where's Jahaan?

175
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:06,813
Good that you came here, son.

176
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:11,938
Jassi is gone,
and you know what state Kulli is in.

177
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,522
We are all alone, Pali.

178
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:16,855
Sukhi, talk to him.

179
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,105
- Pali...
- Where's Jahaan?

180
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,230
Pali...

181
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:54,647
Pali is here.
Do you wish to meet him?

182
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,147
Rohan!

183
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,188
Rohan!

184
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,438
What are you doing?

185
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:57,022
Let's go. Come on.

186
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:59,438
Let's go.

187
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:08,063
Pali...

188
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:17,980
I am done living for others.

189
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:24,563
This time, you come with me.

190
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:26,230
Yes.

191
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,355
Please don't say no.

192
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:31,855
Please don't.

193
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:42,105
The flight leaves tomorrow morning.

194
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,355
Pali, don't wait until
tomorrow morning, leave tonight.

195
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:50,855
Pali...

196
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:53,855
We know where his lawyer friend is.

197
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:57,813
We will soon know where those two are.

198
00:22:00,813 --> 00:22:04,730
I won't leave in that flight alone.

199
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,605
Yeah?

200
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:11,147
Jahaan, if you don't come...

201
00:22:13,522 --> 00:22:15,063
...then I'll kill myself.

202
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:16,772
I won't ask again.

203
00:22:18,313 --> 00:22:21,063
Jahaan...

204
00:22:23,772 --> 00:22:27,022
You should get out of here.

205
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:32,980
Go away.

206
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:43,188
"We'll build a house together..."

207
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:45,647
"Me and you."

208
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:51,855
"Under a thatched roof,
me and you."

209
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:58,147
"Locked in an embrace, me and you."

210
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,688
"Lost in each other's eyes..."

211
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,355
Me and you...

212
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:07,772
Pali.

213
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:15,438
Don't you want to meet
your brother Kulli?

214
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,522
If I see him...

215
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,813
...I'm afraid I'll kill him.

216
00:24:22,522 --> 00:24:24,355
- But Pali...
- Sanober...

217
00:24:26,772 --> 00:24:28,355
You take care.

218
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,772
I'll in touch with you.

219
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:33,105
"I am alive,"

220
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:41,897
"but barely"

221
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:52,522
"There is no support,"

222
00:27:58,313 --> 00:28:02,355
"There is nothing to hang on to"

223
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:12,480
"I'll breathe my last,"

224
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:21,980
"as I embark to a new journey"

225
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:32,730
"Look at the stars,"

226
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,772
"I am immortal"

227
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:49,355
"I am alive,"

228
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:58,397
"but barely"

229
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:09,897
"There is no support,"

230
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:19,897
"Nothing..."

231
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:29,188
"There is nothing..."

232
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:55,397
Stay with me, stay with me, Sunny.

233
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,938
Stay with me, Sunny.

234
00:29:57,855 --> 00:29:59,897
Hey, call an ambulance!

235
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:01,605
Rohan...

236
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:09,313
- You okay?
- Yeah, call an ambulance!

237
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:11,313
Hey, Sunny.

238
00:30:11,522 --> 00:30:12,938
Sunny, look at me.

239
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:14,772
Look at me. Stay with me.

240
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,938
"I am alive,"

241
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:18,063
You're gonna be fine.

242
00:30:22,147 --> 00:30:23,105
You will be fine.

243
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,105
Stay with me.

244
00:30:30,105 --> 00:30:33,897
Rohan... Do you forgive me?

245
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,313
Yes.

246
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:39,313
Do you forgive me?

247
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:42,730
"I am alive,"

248
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:46,480
Do you forgive me?

249
00:30:48,188 --> 00:30:50,147
Do you forgive me?

250
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,272
You bastard... Yes, I forgive you.

251
00:31:08,688 --> 00:31:12,438
"I am alive,"

252
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:15,355
I have forgiven you.
I forgive you.

253
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:21,688
- I did, I did forgive you.
- "but barely"

254
00:31:21,772 --> 00:31:23,105
Get up.

255
00:31:28,522 --> 00:31:32,938
"There is no support,"

256
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,897
"There is nothing to hang on to"

257
00:32:14,188 --> 00:32:18,522
"I am alive,"

258
00:32:24,313 --> 00:32:27,063
"but barely"
