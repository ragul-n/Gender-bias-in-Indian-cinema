1
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:05,093
Sir, for you... No problem.

2
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:07,741
Alright. Thank you.

3
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,597
Hey, Jayesh. Tell me.

4
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:15,662
No, Jayesh. This date...

5
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,630
I mean, almost everyone
wants a booking on that date.

6
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,198
As you know,

7
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,910
everyone in Jamnagar wants
to get married on a yacht.

8
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,579
I agree with you, Mitesh.

9
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,390
But if you could offer
us some discount.

10
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,110
I am giving you the yacht, food, music,

11
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,990
drinks, a DJ and foreign dancers
for free.

12
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,793
You will be only paying for your safety.

13
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,710
Safety is important.
-Yes.

14
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,110
That is why I have hired two
experts on the yacht.

15
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,670
One is captain Shammi Thakur,
ex-Navy officer.

16
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,070
He has weathered many a storm.

17
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,230
Captain Shammi Thakur,
how did you manage

18
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,430
to single-handedly

19
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,310
sink the state-of-the-art and most
powerful submarine

20
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,870
of the Indian navy?

21
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,390
Sir, I beg your pardon,

22
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,230
but your question is irrelevant.

23
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,350
It is unfounded and baseless.

24
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,910
'The word submarine
is made up of'

25
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,310
two different words,

26
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,310
sub which means submersible

27
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,070
and marine which means water.

28
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,750
Allow me to prove it.

29
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,350
Look at this, sir.

30
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,870
How can anyone sink a boat
that's already underwater?

31
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,990
And the other person
is a technical genius,

32
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,630
my son Kedar.

33
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,190
The Americans want him,

34
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,830
but he refuses to go.

35
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,150
Name?
-What?

36
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,230
Tell me your name, please.
-Okay.

37
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,590
Scott Wright.

38
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,470
Not my name, tell me yours.

39
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,990
Kedar Mitesh Desai.

40
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,470
But it says here

41
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,030
you have recently applied twice.
-Yes.

42
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,390
As Kedar Patel.

43
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,430
Yes. But you don't give visa
to Patels.

44
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,950
That is why, I changed
my surname to Desai.

45
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,341
How long do you intend to stay
 in The United States of America?

46
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,390
Forever.
-Forever?

47
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,270
If I get a visa,
why would I come back?

48
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,270
But your application is
 for a tourist visa. -Yes.

49
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,470
And you have already told me,
you are not coming back to India.

50
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:58,574
No. -How are you going to manage
your finances?

51
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,710
Through money transfer.
-What!

52
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,590
Pay in rupees here
and get dollars there.

53
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,373
No problem. It is very simple.

54
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,470
What are you going
to do in America?

55
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,430
I will organise the best
cultural events in New Jersey,

56
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:14,421
earn a few dollars and marry
 an American lady

57
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,150
I will have no problem at all.

58
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,510
I have an aunt named Jayshree

59
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,150
who has been staying in America
illegally for the past 22 years.

60
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,790
She gives rooms on rent for $600.

61
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:24,510
Many people I know have gone there.

62
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,870
Mahesh, Paresh, Suresh and more.

63
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,390
I have had a word with my aunt.

64
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,150
Lodging and boarding
is not a problem.

65
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,630
Why don't you give me
a green card as well?

66
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,830
Enough. Get out.

67
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,750
What is the problem?

68
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:39,901
Out!
-Hold on.

69
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,550
Please wait.

70
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,190
Keep this.

71
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,070
What is this?

72
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,990
Mr Wright,

73
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,350
once you give me a tourist visa,

74
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,190
nobody will know whether
I came back or not.

75
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,150
It is between us.
No one will know.

76
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,390
Security!

77
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,790
Shammi, I am very angry.

78
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,069
First they rejected my visa
 because I was a Patel.

79
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,310
I changed my surname to Desai.

80
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,270
But they rejected
my visa application again.

81
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,990
Mark my words. They will give me
a permanent visa some day.

82
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,030
You want to go to America, right?
-Yes.

83
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,750
I will take you there.

84
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:19,917
Neither of us have visas.

85
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,830
How will we go there?

86
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,070
You need a visa to go by air.

87
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,190
We will go there on a boat.

88
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,270
What are you saying?
Can that really happen?

89
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,550
Of course. Why not?

90
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,190
We will

91
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,070
go via Africa.

92
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,430
Shammi,

93
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,030
can't we go via London?

94
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,550
Please.

95
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,870
Only for you.

96
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,910
We will go via London.

97
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,030
We will party there.

98
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,110
Thank you.
-It's okay.

99
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,470
Why do you want to go to America?

100
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,670
My dad organises parties in India.

101
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,070
I will do the same in America.

102
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,590
I will organise cultural events
and earn a lot of money.

103
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,790
Dad!

104
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,190
I lie through my teeth to get business,

105
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,150
and you want to go to America
and party? -No, dad.

106
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,510
We were discussing our future.

107
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,310
You were discussing your future!
What future are you talking about?

108
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,110
The two of you have no future.

109
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,990
Mitesh, your plans are short-term.

110
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,230
And we are making long-term plans.

111
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,470
Our vision is...

112
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,990
One needs to have brains
to think about their future

113
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,390
and that is what you both lack.

114
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,950
Therefore, just do as I say.
Don't use your brains.

115
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,990
I don't want anything
to go wrong tomorrow.

116
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,746
Don't take the boat too far.

117
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,430
And drinking is prohibited
on the boat.

118
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,070
Once the guests arrive,
leave with the boat.

119
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,790
Alright. We won't use our brains.

120
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,870
Very good. That is what I want.

121
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,270
Thank you. Good night.
-Good night.

122
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,350
Once the guests arrive,
leave with the boat.

123
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,830
Have a blast and
come back by evening.

124
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,510
Do you get it?

125
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,590
Shammi, start the boat.

126
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,230
The guests are here.

127
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,350
Look, the boat is leaving.

128
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,390
Stop the boat.
-Stop!

129
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,390
<i>Oh, it's party time!
Booze is on my mind.</i>

130
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,790
<i>Let's have shots on the boat.</i>

131
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,390
<i>Baby, let's do
something naughty.</i>

132
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,870
<i>It is the tequila
that is talking.</i>

133
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,310
<i>Beautiful girls are next to you.
Try to stay in control.</i>

134
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,990
<i>These cute girls
happened to be indelicate.</i>

135
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,030
<i>They are so mesmerising.</i>

136
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,830
<i>They are also very smart.</i>

137
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,910
<i>They click selfies. That is
something I don't understand.</i>

138
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,670
<i>So, let's just go with the flow.</i>

139
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,630
<i>Everyone is here,
let's have some fun.</i>

140
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,990
<i>Let's have shots on the boat.</i>

141
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,490
<i>What?</i>

142
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,700
<i>What the heck, man?</i>

143
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,370
<i>You got to be
kidding me, hottie.</i>

144
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,380
<i>Show me the money.</i>

145
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,280
<i>Don't say you are coming.</i>

146
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,490
<i>I'm coming after you, running.</i>

147
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,470
<i>She is a guzzler,
she is electric!</i>

148
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,650
<i>She brings the monsoon along!</i>

149
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,860
<i>Let me blow your fuse.</i>

150
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,770
<i>Let me show you what I got.</i>

151
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,480
<i>Come, drink the juice of love.</i>

152
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,400
<i>Party on the boat,
boys and girls are rocking.</i>

153
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,630
<i>On the boat,
let's have some shots.</i>

154
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,530
<i>Oh, it's party time!
Get on the floor.</i>

155
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,660
<i>On the boat,
let's have some shots.</i>

156
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,030
<i>Let's have shots on the boat.
-Oh, it's party time.</i>

157
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,300
<i>Let's have some fun.
-Booze is on my mind.</i>

158
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,550
<i>Party on the boat,
boys and girls are rocking.</i>

159
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,990
<i>Let's have shots on the boat.</i>

160
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,770
<i>Everyone is here,
let's have some fun.</i>

161
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,690
<i>Let's have shots on the boat.</i>

162
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,890
<i>Everyone is here,
let's have some fun.</i>

163
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
<i>Let's have shots on the boat.</i>

164
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,000
<i>Everyone is here,
let's have some fun.</i>

165
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,980
<i>Let's have shots on the boat.</i>

166
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,500
<i>Everyone is here,
let's have some fun.</i>

167
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,150
It's a storm!

168
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,870
Hello, Coast guard! We need help!

169
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,390
Shammi, do something.

170
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,310
Shammi.

171
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,510
Save the girls!

172
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,310
Help!

173
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:53,750
You fool! Don't eat those melons.
They are to be used as bombs.

174
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,910
I'm sorry, boss.

175
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:01,030
If these watermelons don't explode,
none of you will be spared.

176
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,990
Aslam!
-Sir.

177
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,340
Send the watermelons
to their destination.

178
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,010
He was a fool to commit suicide!

179
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,810
His watch is half an hour fast.

180
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,670
<i>At around 8 this
morning two powerful blasts</i>

181
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,430
happened at Karachi beach.

182
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,350
<i>Twelve people died in the blast</i>

183
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,270
<i>and another forty are
reported to be injured.</i>

184
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,830
This is the third big blast
in past 20 days.

185
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,750
<i>Security has been increased
in all parts of the city.</i>

186
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,910
The government will...

187
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,510
<i>We have just received news that
'Lashkar-E-Jaish' has</i>

188
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,590
<i>claimed responsibility for
the blasts in Karachi.</i>

189
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,230
There have been explosions
on the beach of Karachi.

190
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,590
<i>All hospitals are overcrowded
due to the blasts.</i>

191
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,790
<i>And the biggest problems the
doctors face is scarcity of blood.</i>

192
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,950
<i>As you can see,
the beach is being vacated</i>

193
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,590
<i>and the wounded are being
taken to the hospital.</i>

194
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,390
<i>Pakistan intelligence...</i>

195
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,110
Sources suggest, there are movements 
in Islamabad.

196
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,870
Check everything thoroughly.

197
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,590
What's that over there?

198
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,870
Come here and check what's this over here.

199
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,150
What do I do with these things?

200
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,550
Send them for analysis.

201
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,270
Move! Are you mad?

202
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,228
People often get irritated when they find
 themselves alive

203
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,270
in this city.

204
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,110
Now that you are alive,

205
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,950
allow me to share the bed with you.
-Get lost!

206
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,950
Jayesh Kakkar.

207
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,350
Excuse me.

208
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,870
Hey, you!

209
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,298
This man looks like my uncle,
Jayesh Kakkar

210
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,230
but it is not him.

211
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,870
His nose is too big.

212
00:19:16,182 --> 00:19:19,862
Who is he?
-How will this country progress,

213
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,950
when the youth knows not
its great history?

214
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,750
Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

215
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,030
A true patriot.

216
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,550
Tie anklets on the feet

217
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:43,150
of this girl and make her dance.

218
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,470
Prithvi Raj Kapoor...

219
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,710
Mughal-e-Azam.

220
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,150
Have you seen my watch,
wallet and chain?

221
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,990
You should be happy
that you are safe.

222
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,470
Alright. I should go.

223
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,950
Be seated. You still have 
to take the compensation.

224
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,350
I don't want compensation.

225
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,110
He seems to be very rich
to refuse compensation.

226
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,350
No one in Karachi lets go
of the compensation.

227
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,150
Karachi? -Yes.
This is the new Pakistan.

228
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,750
Pakistan!
-Yes. Mr Sharif had stated,

229
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,670
if he wins the elections,
every person who dies or

230
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,390
is injured in bomb blasts
will get compensation.

231
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,950
Who is Mr Sharif?
-What?

232
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,510
The injury seems to have
taken its toll.

233
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,950
Look over there.
That is Nawaz Sharif.

234
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,990
Why is his photo here?
-Where else would it be?

235
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,150
What is going on?

236
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,990
I have informed the reception.
The doctor will be here soon.

237
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,310
Kedar! Oh no!

238
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,830
Excuse me.

239
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,870
What's that written on the wall?

240
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,510
Shameless fellow!

241
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,950
You blindly follow western culture.

242
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,070
Are you ashamed

243
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,070
to speak Urdu?

244
00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:01,510
Shame on you!
-Why are you insulting me?

245
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,910
Young man...
-My name is Kedar.

246
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,350
Don't you know Urdu?

247
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,110
So that's the problem.

248
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,830
Hold on!

249
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:15,550
One.

250
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:23,110
<i>Let's all dance and make merry.</i>

251
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:24,670
Two.

252
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,590
<i>I've got a new parrot,
and it can sing.</i>

253
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,670
The third one is only for you.

254
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,430
Let me sit here.

255
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:41,950
<i>Let me tell you
something, my love.</i>

256
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:50,470
<i>If you are with me,
everything is fine.</i>

257
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,350
Now tell me something.

258
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,190
You know one language
but I know three.

259
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,110
Who is the winner?

260
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,390
Tell me.

261
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,270
Is this Karachi?
-Yes, it is.

262
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,790
The one in Pakistan?
-No, the one in America.

263
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,885
Can I use the phone? -The phone
booth is outside. You can use that.

264
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,750
A thin and tall guy
came in here with me.

265
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,510
Have you seen him around?

266
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,230
You came in with forty
other people.

267
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,350
All of them are in the same ward.
Did you check?

268
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,070
I checked the ward.
He is not in there.

269
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,150
He could have gone home
after receiving treatment.

270
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,590
He cannot go home.

271
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,470
If he is not in the ward
and hasn't gone home,

272
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,510
then he must be in ward number 11.
-Thank you.

273
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,510
Eight.

274
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,590
Nine.

275
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,390
Ten. Eleven.

276
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,550
Darn!

277
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,390
This...

278
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,630
Oh God!

279
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,070
Kedar!

280
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,390
I'm sorry.

281
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:27,957
I will never be able
to forgive myself.

282
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,230
It wasn't your fault.

283
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,950
I was steering the boat.
I should have died.

284
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:36,741
I didn't even get the chance to tell you

285
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,270
that you were like a younger
brother to me.

286
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,030
We partied...
-Who is he?

287
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,310
What the...

288
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,870
This is my watch.
-You...

289
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,310
You scared me.

290
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,190
You thought that was me.
-No.

291
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,670
You were crying for me,
weren't you? Yes, I know.

292
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,870
I knew, you were standing behind
me. -I am touched.

293
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,870
Don't talk nonsense.

294
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,830
Do you know where we are?
-Where?

295
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,910
Karachi, Pakistan.
-Okay.

296
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,750
Karachi?
-Yes.

297
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,790
The one in Pakistan.
-Yes.

298
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,590
Oh God! Don't cry.

299
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,390
Just chill. Calm.

300
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,110
I want to go back home.
-Me too.

301
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,270
Please take me home.
-Yes.

302
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,110
Look at what they do to people
who live her legally.

303
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,070
And we haven't come here legally.

304
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,510
Please take me home.

305
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,230
I have to think of something.
-My dad will die of shock.

306
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,150
We have to do something.
-Dad.

307
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,230
Listen...
-I don't want to...

308
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,750
I have an idea.

309
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,110
We should change our clothes.

310
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,870
Let's wear their clothes, mingle
with the crowd and get out of here.

311
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,950
Then, go to the Indian embassy.
-How do we hide our face?

312
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,910
We are in Pakistan,
not in Africa or China.

313
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,870
We look just like them.

314
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,230
Thank God!

315
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,510
Have you seen him?

316
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:03,350
No.

317
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,110
Have you seen him?
-No.

318
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,646
Let's go.
-Thank you.

319
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,550
Greetings!
-Greetings to you too.

320
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,950
Have you seen this man?

321
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,070
No, sir.

322
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,750
Okay.

323
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,070
Shammi.
-Yes.

324
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,710
This is not fair.
It is very wrong.

325
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,030
Yes, it is wrong.

326
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,310
My clothes are torn,
but yours are not.

327
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,830
This is not fair, Shammi.

328
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,310
Are you going to a fashion show?

329
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,470
We have much bigger problems
than that.

330
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,990
My dad says not to wear torn
clothes. It is a bad omen.

331
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,510
We are in Pakistan.

332
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,430
What could be worse than that?

333
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,190
Let's go from here before
we are caught. Come on.

334
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,950
Who will catch us?
What nonsense! It's not that easy.

335
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,710
Kedar...

336
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,350
Where are you taking me?
Kedar, run.

337
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,390
Shammi...
-Kedar, listen to me. Run.

338
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,510
Run!

339
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,190
What happened?
-Don't run.

340
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,710
Don't run.
-Who is he?

341
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,870
He is my assistant.
Don't shoot him.

342
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,350
We are innocent.

343
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,630
What do you want from us?
Let us go.

344
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,070
Soon, you will know everything.

345
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:27,350
Come on.
-Walk.

346
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,670
What do you want from us?

347
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,430
We want you to deliver a child.

348
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,150
That is impossible.

349
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,990
Go in.

350
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:36,334
Sorry.

351
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,110
My Lord!

352
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,070
I...

353
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,390
I will do something.

354
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,750
Were you shot?

355
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,270
Yes. But at that time, I was
not wearing this garment.

356
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,710
Is there a phone in here?

357
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,990
What is the hurry? Hold on.
-Why don't you do something?

358
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,470
Yes.

359
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,390
I want warm water and a towel.
-What?

360
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,750
I want warm water and a towel.

361
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,270
Shammi, it is a tense situation,
and you want to take a bath?

362
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,990
This is what I have seen in movies.

363
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,750
Hello, dad.

364
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,950
Kedar?

365
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,150
Kedar, where are you two?
-We are...

366
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,070
We are in Karachi.
-Karachi?

367
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,622
What should I do now?

368
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,550
Darn it!

369
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,750
Darn it!

370
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,070
How long will you fool me?

371
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,710
Where is Shammi?
-He is helping with delivery.

372
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,990
Push! Push!

373
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,110
Delivery?

374
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,310
I didn't send you for delivery.

375
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,510
Hold on, dad.

376
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,830
Shammi, ask that girl
to lower her voice.

377
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,230
Sorry, dad.
There is a lot of disturbance here.

378
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,910
Both of you come back with the yacht,
 right now.

379
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,510
Dad, the boat...

380
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:43,965
Hold on.

381
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,630
Shammi, will you have something?

382
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,230
Black coffee for me.

383
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,590
Should I order something for you?

384
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,670
Mister, can you please
get one black coffee?

385
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,390
Thank you.
-Hello?

386
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,030
Hello, dad. We are in Pakistan.

387
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,750
If you are in Pakistan,
call the Indian army.

388
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,950
Why are you troubling me?

389
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:07,118
But how do we contact
the Indian army?

390
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,750
You fool!

391
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,030
I have an idea.

392
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,750
Is there a vacuum cleaner?
-Vacuum cleaner?

393
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,070
You fool, first, do your job.

394
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,430
You can do the cleaning later.
-I am doing my job.

395
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,470
Sir, I need a vacuum cleaner.

396
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,830
Now, the baby will be out in no time.

397
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,590
Dad, you won't believe this,

398
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,230
Shammi delivered a baby.

399
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,230
Kedar, no matter where you are,

400
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:46,030
come back to Jamnagar
with my yacht.

401
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,270
Dad...
-Hel...

402
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,430
It's done.

403
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,550
It is a boy.

404
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,390
Congratulations.

405
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,070
To whom were you
speaking on the phone?

406
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,110
I was talking to dad.

407
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,950
Your dad? What did he say?

408
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,870
He doesn't believe
that we are in Karachi.

409
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,750
Shammi, what will we do now?

410
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,910
Let's go to the Indian consulate.

411
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,990
I'm sure, we'll get help there.

412
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,070
But where is it?

413
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,870
We can't even ask anyone.
-Why?

414
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,750
Hey, mister?
-Yes.

415
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,270
Do you know where
the Indian consulate is?

416
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,710
We don't want to go there.

417
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,470
We want to go to Amjad's shop

418
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,750
which is on the same street.

419
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,110
Okay. It is at Clifton.
-Thank you.

420
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,230
Shammi.

421
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,670
Who is Amjad?
-No idea.

422
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,950
I assumed there must be one
Amjad in every house in Pakistan.

423
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,390
Okay.
-Yes.

424
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,150
And who taught you
how to help with a childbirth?

425
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,030
Raju Hirani.

426
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,230
Let's go to Clifton.
-Okay.

427
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,870
One call has been made to India.
Here are the details.

428
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,310
Blast? They spoke about the RAW.

429
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,830
And also about a delivery.

430
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,910
What's the calling location?

431
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,830
Gizri.

432
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,430
Was he one of them?
-Yes.

433
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,230
But he is a doctor.

434
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,990
Are you sure, he is a doctor?
-Yes.

435
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,310
Do you have any idea
where he has gone?

436
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,830
He asked for the Indian 
consulate's address.

437
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,950
Clos-ed...

438
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,510
Closed until

439
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,110
further notice.

440
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,870
Please contact High Commission

441
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,790
of India, Islamabad.

442
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,150
Where is that written?

443
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,790
On the second board.
-Okay.

444
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,270
How can they be closed?

445
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,390
The government officials
in Pakistan

446
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,870
are just like the ones in India.
-Shammi.

447
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,630
Shammi, I am hungry.

448
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,550
Let me ask someone.

449
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,230
Sit here.

450
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,390
When will the consulate open?
-It won't.

451
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,230
There was a shootout here last week
in which the tea seller died.

452
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,110
Since then I have been
selling tea here.

453
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,510
He was shot for no reason?
-This is what happens here.

454
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,133
Stay in the car.

455
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,230
People in Karachi love to kill.
-Okay.

456
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,510
Bullets are cheaper than potato.
-What are you saying?

457
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,910
Hence, I too have purchased a gun
for my protection.

458
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,310
Excuse me. Have you seen this man?

459
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,310
This is very dangerous.
-Yes.

460
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,470
Hello. Why haven't you reached
the location yet?

461
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:16,662
India? I said meet us at the Indian
 consulate, Clifton.

462
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,590
You want to go to India
for everything.

463
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,390
Have you seen this man?

464
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,750
Him? Hold on.

465
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,030
Shammi, a beautiful girl
is looking for you.

466
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,230
Freeze!

467
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,110
What are you looking at? Shoot!

468
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,430
Darn it!

469
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,070
Jahan Bahadur,
it is a situation of war.

470
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,150
I knew that you are a Pakistani.
-What?

471
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,350
She wants to kill you
because you knocked her up.

472
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:07,134
But then why did
the tea seller shoot at the girl?

473
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,830
That is a point.

474
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,910
America!
-Shut up!

475
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,510
America, do I need to tell you

476
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:27,150
that our army is set. This
little man is going to show you.

477
00:33:27,397 --> 00:33:31,197
You are going to lose.
Beware, America!

478
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,310
Stop!

479
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,630
Now I got it.
-What?

480
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,510
Whose clothes did I steal?

481
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,390
A dead man's clothes.
-A dead man cannot talk.

482
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,150
And whose clothes did you
steal? Tell me. -Doctor.

483
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,670
Doctor is alive and
complained to his wife.

484
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:10,135
So, she has come here to take back
 the doctor's clothes.

485
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,578
That's why she is shooting at us.

486
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,828
What a country!

487
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:15,162
They are ready to kill even
for a pair of clothes.

488
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,110
Kedar, run!

489
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,270
<i>They are fools.
They are a bunch of losers.</i>

490
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,590
<i>They fell out of the frying pan
and into the fire.</i>

491
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,710
<i>They are fools.
They are a bunch of losers.</i>

492
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,910
<i>They fell out of the frying pan
and into the fire.</i>

493
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,230
<i>They must find a way to escape.</i>

494
00:34:57,317 --> 00:35:00,597
<i>Else their lives
will be in danger.</i>

495
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,590
<i>Run, else...</i>

496
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:08,550
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

497
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,710
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

498
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:18,070
<i>Run, else you will be doomed.</i>

499
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,790
<i>Fly like a rocket or
run like a rabbit,</i>

500
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,710
<i>you got to cross the border.</i>

501
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,110
<i>Fly like a rocket or
run like a rabbit,</i>

502
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,990
<i>you got to cross the border.</i>

503
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,350
<i>You are so screwed that
this will end badly.</i>

504
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,590
<i>Quickly find a solution to it.</i>

505
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,350
<i>You should start praying.</i>

506
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,750
<i>Else, you won't be spared.</i>

507
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,670
<i>Run, else...</i>

508
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,550
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

509
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,790
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

510
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,230
<i>Run, else you will be doomed.</i>

511
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,270
<i>Either hypnotize or mesmerize</i>

512
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,830
<i>or surprise everyone
to break the rules.</i>

513
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,590
<i>Go beyond limits</i>

514
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,030
<i>and change your destination.</i>

515
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,510
<i>Your luck isn't favouring you.
There is danger everywhere.</i>

516
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,030
<i>If you don't stay alert,
it could get worse.</i>

517
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,870
<i>Run, else...</i>

518
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,790
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

519
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:23,270
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

520
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,590
<i>Run, else you will be doomed.</i>

521
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:31,325
Aslam, what do you think
those men want?

522
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,750
I am scared that their presence
might terrorise the city.

523
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,310
I agree. We must keep it a secret.

524
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,190
Shammi.

525
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,790
I cannot walk further.

526
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,470
You have to walk.
-I am sitting down here.

527
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,630
Please give me food.
I am very hungry.

528
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,910
Either give me food
or sing a lullaby for me.

529
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,830
My brother rocks
the cradle for me...

530
00:38:14,382 --> 00:38:18,102
<i>It is not right to steal.
It is not a good habit.</i>

531
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:22,430
<i>A thief is always punished.</i>

532
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,190
<i>It is not right.</i>

533
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,150
Kedar, run!

534
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,590
Kedar, run!

535
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,950
Shammi!

536
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,550
Wait for me. Where are you going?

537
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,910
Who is it?

538
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,950
You are not the groom,

539
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,830
and your friend is not the doctor.

540
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,350
And you both are not Pakistanis.

541
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,430
You have come from India.
-Yes.

542
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,790
That too in a yacht.

543
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,390
Wow! -You are the first person
who has believed our story.

544
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,750
No one is ready to believe us.
-Quiet.

545
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,910
Do you think I am a fool?

546
00:39:46,346 --> 00:39:50,043
How do I believe you?

547
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:55,470
You can see my father
and I dancing in Youtube.

548
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,240
Youtube is banned in Pakistan.
-What?

549
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,740
Skype?
-Banned.

550
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,080
Whatsapp?
-Banned.

551
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,820
Do you subscribed to 3G services?

552
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,631
Everything is banned,
so you should unsubscribe 3g!

553
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,750
Tell me,

554
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,310
whom do you work for?

555
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,070
Who sent you?
-We work for no one.

556
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,670
No one sent us.

557
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,950
We stole pizza because
we were hungry.

558
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,430
We didn't know, there was
a gun inside the pizza box.

559
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,990
It was he who stole the pizza.
-Who will pay for my loss?

560
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,750
Your dad?

561
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,430
His dad will pay for it.
-What?

562
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,590
Shammi, my dad doesn't give me
money. Why will he give him?

563
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,310
He will definitely pay
a ransom for you.

564
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,950
Zuber?
-Boss.

565
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,710
What's the number?

566
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,060
Seven.

567
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,070
I am asking for your dad's phone number.

568
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,470
9-8-2-0-3.

569
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,650
6-5-6-0-8.

570
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,150
Hello.

571
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,150
What's the name?
-Kedar Patel.

572
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,390
Hello, Kedar Patel?

573
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,830
Hello.

574
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,870
I am talking to your dad, not you.
-Mitesh Patel.

575
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,670
He is Kedar Patel.

576
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,470
Hello, Mitesh Patel.

577
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,110
This is Azar Baloch
for Karachi, Pakistan.

578
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:31,150
Mister, if you want to book
my yacht, call up the office.

579
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,630
You fool!

580
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,190
Listen to me carefully.

581
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,150
I have your son and his friend.

582
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:41,230
If you are a friend of
Kedar and Shammi,

583
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,630
I will break your bones.

584
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,750
I am not their friend.
-Excuse me.

585
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,630
Can I try?
-Talk to him.

586
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,750
Mitesh, what are you doing?
Why are you arguing?

587
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,510
He might shoot us.

588
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,190
You know where we are.
-Give me the phone.

589
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,310
Hello, dad.

590
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,950
You never took me seriously.

591
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:05,350
Had you believed me the last
time, it wouldn't have cost you.

592
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,747
Now do you understand?

593
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,470
Listen to me carefully.

594
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,350
Sir... If you want 10, ask for 20.

595
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,630
If you want 20, ask for 40.

596
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,990
He'll pay you
only half the amount.

597
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,590
Rs 10 million.
-What?

598
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,550
Rs 10 million? For two people?

599
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,870
I have an idea.

600
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,070
You keep them.

601
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,750
Who will pay for our loss?
-Loss?

602
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,590
What could be the loss?

603
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,670
You have them
only for the past two days.

604
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,950
One of them is with me
since his birth.

605
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,470
I didn't ask you to father a child.

606
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,510
I just want my money.

607
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:46,110
Rs 5 million is too much. Let's
make a deal in Rs 2.5 million.

608
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,510
You bargain a lot.

609
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,950
Close the deal at Rs 3 million.

610
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,190
Rs 3 million?

611
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:57,150
It seems, Karachi is a cheap city.

612
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,670
You will get Rs 2 million now 
and Rs 1 million after the delivery.

613
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,350
Alright.

614
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,190
Zuber.
-Boss.

615
00:43:04,294 --> 00:43:07,790
Until we get the money...
-Okay.

616
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,190
They are our guests.

617
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,950
Take good care of them.
-Okay.

618
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,830
What will you eat?

619
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,270
Little...

620
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,910
'Sheekh' kebab, 'tangdi' kebab

621
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,430
and 'chapli' kebab.

622
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,150
Please get that along with 'roomali' rotis
 and 'biryani'.

623
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:28,910
'Nalli nihari', 'bheja masala',
'mutton chop' and 'kaleji'.

624
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,230
'Phirni' for desserts.

625
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,230
If you like to send something else,
please do.

626
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,790
Azar, I am a vegetarian.

627
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:40,430
Alright.

628
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,550
Boss, we have got the money.

629
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,310
Alright. Send them back.

630
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,350
Excuse me.

631
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,630
Mister, I am talking to you.

632
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:09,870
I said, listen to me.
I am talking to you.

633
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,790
Azar, I can hear from my ears.

634
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,510
My mouth is busy,
but you can speak. I am listening.

635
00:44:18,342 --> 00:44:20,022
From here,
you will go to Orangi town,

636
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,710
get your passport

637
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,310
and go back to India
via Kathmandu.

638
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,830
Azar,

639
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,590
I have a question.

640
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,630
Can't we go to Bangkok?

641
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,910
Do I look like a fool?

642
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,270
Don't you dare answer that!

643
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:39,450
Oh Lord! Take them away!
-Okay.

644
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,070
That is where you have to go.

645
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,270
This is a Pathan neighbourhood.

646
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,230
If they see a Baloch,
they will attack.

647
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,550
Everyone in this city
wants to kill someone.

648
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,750
We shall meet again
if destiny wants. Please go.

649
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:06,030
You are talking as if we
won't ever meet again.

650
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,670
If you ever come to India,
you can stay at my house.

651
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,630
I will send you a request
on social media, accept it.

652
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,870
Sir.
-And also...

653
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,590
If you want to remain alive,
make him shut up. -Okay.

654
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,070
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

655
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,710
What did he say?
-Nothing.

656
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,230
He just said...
-I hope, he said nothing about me.

657
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,950
You will get them in an hour.
-Where will we go for an hour?

658
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,710
There is a hotel nearby.
-We don't have money.

659
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,870
You can have tea there.
-Who has tea for an hour?

660
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:48,950
He is stupid.

661
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,990
Get lost.
-Okay.

662
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,950
Shammi,

663
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,990
what will we do now?

664
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,110
Let's go to the hotel!

665
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,510
Hurray!
-No.

666
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,290
Superb!

667
00:46:07,776 --> 00:46:09,102
It is an old match.

668
00:46:12,678 --> 00:46:15,918
Well done, Afridi!
-Very good, Afridi.

669
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:19,190
It is an old match. India will
win this match. Believe me.

670
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,750
It is a matter of half an hour.
Relax!

671
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,390
Oh no!
-On God!

672
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,910
Now, cheer for him!
You lousy Pathans.

673
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,750
What happened?
Why are you quiet now?

674
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,830
A wicket has been taken.

675
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,550
Afridi is out! Get me tea.

676
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,270
You all were cheering for Afridi.

677
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,870
Out! In the pavilion.

678
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,630
Get me some tea.

679
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,990
You like cricket?
Yes!

680
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,790
Yes. Yes. Yes.

681
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:55,870
What happened?

682
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,910
Don't mess with me!
Get me a cup of tea.

683
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,830
He seems to be a migrant.
-Yes.

684
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,790
<i>Run, else...</i>

685
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:10,910
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

686
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:17,310
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

687
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,510
<i>Run, else you will be doomed.</i>

688
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,710
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

689
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,870
<i>Run, else you will be doomed.</i>

690
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,870
<i>Get out of here.</i>

691
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:35,550
<i>Else, you won't be spared.</i>

692
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,990
<i>Run, else...</i>

693
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,190
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

694
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,430
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

695
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:52,830
<i>Run, else you will be doomed.</i>

696
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:56,030
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

697
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:59,110
<i>Run, else you will be doomed.</i>

698
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:26,110
It is all your fault.
-My fault?

699
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,750
You messed with the Pathans.

700
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:30,510
I was carried away by emotions.
But what about you?

701
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,630
Had you not messed
with the Pathans,

702
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,590
we would have crossed
the border by now.

703
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,430
It is America's fault.

704
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,870
It is all because of America.

705
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,070
You wanted to go to America,
so the yacht sank.

706
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,390
But I wanted to take a flight.
It was your idea to take the yacht.

707
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,790
It was my plan,
but it was your need.

708
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,870
It is America's fault.
It is always America's fault.

709
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,350
Right?
-Yes.

710
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,070
Had we been going to Dubai on the yacht, 
it wouldn't have sunk.

711
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,070
Right or left?

712
00:48:56,935 --> 00:49:00,095
We took a right last?
-Yes.

713
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,699
If we take a right again,
we might go back to the same place.

714
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:04,044
Go straight.
-Okay.

715
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,422
If you don't mind,
can I say something? -Sure.

716
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:07,468
Take a left.

717
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:08,531
Okay.
-Take left.

718
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:11,815
See, we would've been lost.
-I could be wrong at times.

719
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:12,875
Hold on!

720
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,270
Oh darn it!

721
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,550
Who are you?
-How did you get in the car?

722
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,150
I am warning you,
we are very dangerous people.

723
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,430
I am a traveller.

724
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,110
I can take you to your destination.

725
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,910
Sir, we want to go
across the border.

726
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:33,190
I know the route to every border.

727
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:34,670
What?

728
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,150
He seems to be a refugee.
-Can you take us to the border?

729
00:49:38,982 --> 00:49:40,182
Go straight.

730
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:50,990
What happened?
-You scared me.

731
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:52,430
I was trying to scare him.

732
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:55,470
Where should I go now?

733
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,830
Just go straight.

734
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,390
Who are they?

735
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,030
My friends.

736
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:14,270
Shammi.

737
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,390
They look dangerous.
-Yes.

738
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,190
They look very dangerous.

739
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,230
I just hope, they take us
across the border.

740
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,590
Let's go.

741
00:50:33,078 --> 00:50:34,918
Greetings.
-Greetings.

742
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,150
I hope, you had a comfortable journey.

743
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:40,710
Can you two please shift
the luggage from the boot?

744
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,710
The journey was fine,
but I had a situation.

745
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:51,030
Thankfully,

746
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:54,110
these two men could be very useful.

747
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:57,750
Shammi,

748
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,630
is this a fruit basket?

749
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,910
I don't think so.

750
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,630
Stay quiet. Don't say anything.

751
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:06,517
Take it out.

752
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,270
They are fools.

753
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,510
They won't ask many questions.

754
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,430
They want to go across the border.

755
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,470
Ask Aaga to take good care of them.
-Okay.

756
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,390
They might be useful.

757
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,190
Excuse me.

758
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:30,630
Who is he?
-Pasha of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,

759
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,150
Mullah Nasrullah.

760
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,830
Didn't you recognise him?
-Yes, we did.

761
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,510
We very well know him.

762
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:39,398
He is our friend.

763
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:45,630
Boys, go with my friend.
He will help you cross the border.

764
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,070
Alright.

765
00:51:54,672 --> 00:51:56,552
What are you doing?

766
00:51:57,606 --> 00:51:59,366
Thank you, sir.
-Go.

767
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,750
Greetings, brother.

768
00:52:43,645 --> 00:52:45,525
Well done.
-Father,

769
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,670
here is a gift from
Mullah Nasrullah.

770
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,870
They want to go across the border.

771
00:52:50,972 --> 00:52:53,710
Mullah Nasrullah said they might
 be helpful.

772
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,870
They are birdbrains.
They won't ask many questions.

773
00:53:23,414 --> 00:53:25,294
What is your name?
-Shammi.

774
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,750
My friend is mute.

775
00:53:33,622 --> 00:53:34,862
No problem.

776
00:55:35,901 --> 00:55:37,461
Kedar, this place
is very dangerous.

777
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,030
If we listen to these men,
we are going to die

778
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,590
and even if we don't.

779
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,830
We should elope from this place
as soon as possible.

780
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:48,230
I am thinking... -How would
I know what you are thinking?

781
00:55:49,311 --> 00:55:51,231
Doesn't this place
look like Shimla?

782
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:52,750
Shimla?

783
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:54,991
Let's stay here for a few days.

784
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,310
Will your dad come here after
a few days to save us? -Hey!

785
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:03,110
Do you know how expensive
a holiday in hill stations is?

786
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:07,230
We are getting this opportunity for free,
and you want to run away?

787
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:12,070
Think like a Gujarati, Shammi.

788
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:17,550
Right now, I can think
of only one thing.

789
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,470
What do I get out of this?

790
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:24,246
Two nights and three days,
free holiday with the terrorists.

791
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,990
You said, your friend is mute.

792
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:49,925
His name is Gunga,
which means mute.

793
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,990
Gunga-ul-Itefaaq.

794
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,390
And what is your name?

795
00:56:58,598 --> 00:56:59,758
Shammi

796
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:03,430
Al-Wahtafaq!

797
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,950
Gunga, are you Gujarati?

798
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:12,270
Gunga, you are ready.

799
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,590
Aaga, the great, also feels
that you are a Gujarati.

800
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:20,510
Our next destination...
Our next mission is Gujarat.

801
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:22,181
We will bombard the entire state.

802
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,590
He was preparing for that.
-Correct.

803
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,150
I am ready.
-Yes.

804
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,990
Gujarat was my mission.

805
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,150
Now, I will go to Gujarat

806
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:31,750
and blast it apart.
-Yes.

807
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,590
I will plant bombs in Gujarat.
-Blast.

808
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,310
Amazing!

809
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,990
I need people like you.
-Thank you.

810
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,710
Who can travel anywhere.
-Correct.

811
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,870
Let it be Gujarat or Gujarwala.

812
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:45,950
Let it be Washington or Wadala.

813
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,990
I am proud of people like you.

814
00:57:49,145 --> 00:57:51,113
We are proud of you too.
-We are proud of you too.

815
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:55,070
No. I am proud of you.

816
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,070
No. We are proud of you.

817
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:02,030
No. I am proud of you.
-No. We are proud of you.

818
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:05,230
We all are proud of you.
-We all are proud of you.

819
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:08,270
We all are proud of you.

820
00:58:08,462 --> 00:58:10,542
We all are proud of you.

821
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,750
Those men

822
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,550
are fools.
-Yes.

823
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,870
They are from Gujarat, India.

824
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:28,710
Let them be from India or Pakistan,

825
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:31,070
it doesn't matter to me.

826
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,190
Son.
-Yes, father.

827
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:37,590
Start their training.

828
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:39,990
Prepare them.

829
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:41,807
Let them know everything.

830
00:58:43,517 --> 00:58:44,917
Show them our hospitality.

831
00:58:45,701 --> 00:58:47,301
They will be very useful to us.

832
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,790
Prepare them for a sacrifice.

833
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:51,750
I want their blood.

834
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,790
Gujarat!

835
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,830
Come on.
-I am going.

836
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:06,190
This is too high.
-Come on. Dive.

837
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,270
What are you doing? Hey!

838
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:20,470
I am still a kid. Mom...

839
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:40,190
This gun is very heavy.

840
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,910
Ahmed, be careful.
-Yes, boss.

841
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,150
Shammi.
-Yes.

842
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,870
Give my regards to Aaga.

843
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:52,310
I think he is Mullah's delivery boy.

844
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,910
He delivers all arms
and ammunition.

845
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:57,550
Should I ask him?
-Please.

846
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,190
I will call later.
-Mister?

847
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:04,190
Do you deliver vegetarian pizza?

848
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:05,630
Vegetarian pizza?

849
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,910
I am hungry.
-Who are they?

850
01:00:08,581 --> 01:00:10,941
They are Mujahids, sent by Mullah
 from Karachi.

851
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,710
Come on. Get in the car.

852
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,670
Aaga, we have got the arms.

853
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,990
This is the detonator of the bomb.

854
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:26,070
But it looks like a mobile phone.

855
01:01:01,965 --> 01:01:03,205
Say it loud!

856
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,630
Let's get ready for war!
-Say it loud!

857
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,070
Hello, uncle.
-Hello, Shammi.

858
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:10,830
Now, it's our turn to attack.

859
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,710
Aaga, can I ask you something?

860
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:22,550
Yes.

861
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,550
How do they send phone bills here?

862
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:28,950
They don't send us bills. Only
the brave hearts are allowed here.

863
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:41,350
Aaga!
-Greetings.

864
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:44,230
Greetings.

865
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:47,710
Hail the Almighty Lord!

866
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:51,270
I am very thankful to you all

867
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:53,550
for coming here on my invitation.

868
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:57,550
It is time to fulfil our aims

869
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,390
for which we have gathered here.

870
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:06,430
Our enemy assumes
that he is more devious,

871
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:09,310
more cunning and smarter than us.

872
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,270
But today, I will prove

873
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,910
that we are smarter

874
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:17,830
and more cunning than him.

875
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:20,630
Can you see this sheep?

876
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,830
I have 100 such sheep

877
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,390
and have filled RDX
in all their stomachs.

878
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:29,030
My sheep

879
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,590
will go to all the officials
of every ministry.

880
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,910
These sheep will be a medium
to end their lives.

881
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:39,270
Instead of meat,
they will deliver death.

882
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:42,470
Wonderful!

883
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:01,790
Not bad!

884
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,110
Kedar, the truth is,

885
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:10,310
we have learnt to fire a gun here.

886
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,430
We couldn't have
done that in India.

887
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:18,150
That's right. I never thought
my aim would be so good.

888
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:21,510
Shammi.
-Yes.

889
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:23,230
Slowly,

890
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:26,550
I am feeling very scared here.

891
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,710
If we do as they say, we will die
and even if we don't.

892
01:03:30,979 --> 01:03:32,750
These words sound familiar.

893
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:34,750
My friend Shammi had told me that.

894
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:38,950
Oh yes! -Shammi, I'm sorry.
Let's go from here.

895
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:43,710
I have an idea.

896
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,470
It is a little dangerous.

897
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:47,350
You always give dangerous ideas.

898
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,390
What can I do?
We are with the Taliban.

899
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:50,795
Everything here is dangerous.

900
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:52,750
Tell me the idea.

901
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,550
Quietly, let's go from here.

902
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:57,510
We'll give the excuse
of going to the loo. -Okay.

903
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,750
We are going to the loo.

904
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:03,430
We are right here. Where can we go?
-We're going to the loo.

905
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:21,630
Shammi, where are you taking me?

906
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:23,950
Hide yourself.

907
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:34,590
It is not right to steal.
It is not a good habit.

908
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:38,350
<i>A thief is always punished.</i>

909
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:40,270
<i>It is not right.</i>

910
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:46,190
Yes.

911
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:48,630
<i>It is not right.</i>

912
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,150
Cell phone.

913
01:04:56,471 --> 01:04:58,596
What is this, Shammi?
In the generation of iPhone 6,

914
01:04:58,621 --> 01:05:00,261
you want this outdated phone.

915
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,870
Let's take the laptop. We'll get
a lot of money by selling it.

916
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:06,390
Stupid! I can use the phone
to call your dad.

917
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,230
Yes.
-Idiot!

918
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,510
You are so smart!

919
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:24,430
This place is stinking.

920
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,750
Shammi!
-Let's call your dad.

921
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:37,790
Come on.
-Network?

922
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:39,950
Make a call.
-Yes.

923
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,910
Come over this side.

924
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:44,758
There is no network here.
-Come up.

925
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,550
Okay.

926
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,550
Did you find the network?
-No.

927
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:54,439
Hold on. It was blinking.

928
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:56,470
Tell your father's number.

929
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:58,550
9-8.
-9-8.

930
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:01,190
Say it.
-You thought, I forgot?

931
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:03,110
9-8-2-0-3.

932
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:05,230
6-5-6-0-8.
-6-5...

933
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:07,430
6-0-8.
-Yes. Is it ringing?

934
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,710
Activated?
Your dad's name is activated.

935
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:11,941
Your dad's name is activated?

936
01:06:11,981 --> 01:06:13,861
Last I heard, it was Mitesh Patel.

937
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:16,390
My dad is a little weird.

938
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:21,910
What is this light for?

939
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:31,390
Darn it! What was that?

940
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:37,790
There are explosions in Kaba hills.

941
01:06:37,982 --> 01:06:40,982
Where?
-32 degrees, north.

942
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,910
Move to Kaba hills.

943
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:45,790
That looks like a camp.
-Is it a Taliban camp?

944
01:06:49,101 --> 01:06:51,581
I spot something, sir. Two males.

945
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:53,430
Look at that.
-Yes.

946
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:57,390
Stay with them. Don't lose them.
I want to find out who they are.

947
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:00,750
We are innocent.

948
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:03,790
What are they saying?

949
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:07,310
Closer!

950
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,990
They seem to be from Al-Qaeda, sir.

951
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:12,870
They are moving. Stay with them.

952
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:18,630
Go after them.

953
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,190
Where are we off to?
-Drive faster.

954
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,870
Go!

955
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:29,190
You can run, but you can't hide.

956
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:35,030
The air is blowing from the right.
-What is this?

957
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:37,070
Move in this direction?
-What does this mean?

958
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,070
It is air. Take a right.

959
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:41,078
No. Move straight.

960
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:45,310
Start the right indicator,
but take a left. -Okay.

961
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,110
What are you doing?

962
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,990
To the left.

963
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:52,750
Go!

964
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:54,910
Load the ammunition.

965
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,190
It is right behind us.

966
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:01,390
Guns!
-No. On the other side.

967
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:06,110
It is coming from ahead.

968
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:09,270
Stop the car.

969
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,950
Don't shoot.

970
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,870
What are you doing?

971
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,630
Please point the gun at him,
not me.

972
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:20,190
Please.

973
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:32,710
Who do you think, these guys are?

974
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:35,350
Just fools, sir.
-Yes.

975
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:36,470
It is a cover up.

976
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:38,350
Why would the Taliban
bomb themselves?

977
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:43,830
Maybe because they think,
it's a shortcut to paradise.

978
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,870
You think, it is revenge?

979
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:48,510
Whoever they are,

980
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:51,310
they are very clever.

981
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:54,150
Look at them. Look at their faces.

982
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:56,670
This is the new face of terror,

983
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:58,630
and it is threatening America.

984
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:01,870
Now, you get in there and find out
who they are.

985
01:09:04,063 --> 01:09:05,293
You know this guy?

986
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:14,390
He was an actor in 'Mandela'.

987
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:19,630
I have seen his photo before,
but I can't recognise him.

988
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,070
That film was without subtitles.

989
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,670
I don't know.
-Sorry.

990
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,110
So, what are you guys?

991
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:38,110
Taliban?

992
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:40,750
Terrorists?

993
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:43,470
Why are you here?
To blow this country up?

994
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,910
Where are you from? Afghanistan?

995
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,950
What is it? IIFA or ISIS?
I for Israel?

996
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:49,630
We are from Gujarat.

997
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:53,070
Yes. -He is Gujarati.
I am Indian.

998
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:56,230
We are not from Israel.
We don't look like them.

999
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,510
So, where is Gujarat?
-I know this answer.

1000
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,590
Gujarat is a state.

1001
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,590
Gandhi Nagar is
the capital of Gujarat.

1002
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,110
Language spoken is Gujarati.

1003
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,950
Our favourite dance is 'garba'.

1004
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:07,550
And we love...

1005
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:10,150
Shut up!

1006
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:12,510
I asked, where is Gujarat?

1007
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:14,910
Not what it is.
-Gujarat...

1008
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:16,830
Gujarat is in India.

1009
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:19,110
He and I, we are from India.

1010
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,230
We are Indians.

1011
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,030
Remember this?

1012
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:30,310
So, this is the problem.

1013
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:33,150
We are very sorry.

1014
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:36,110
This is the first time
we robbed anything.

1015
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:38,750
This is the first time
we robbed a phone.

1016
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:40,070
We have never robbed before.

1017
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:42,070
No. I stole dad's car
when I was a kid.

1018
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:43,830
I wanted to take Hetal for a ride.

1019
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:45,630
Father's car.

1020
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,150
He borrowed his dad's
car for a date.

1021
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:51,030
Before that, I stole Rs 200
from my dad's wallet.

1022
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,270
He stole money.

1023
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:54,870
Little money and car.

1024
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,030
Lunch. When I was in grade ninth,

1025
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:59,190
I stole Kamesh's lunch box.

1026
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:02,350
Kamlesh is his younger brother.
He robs only in the family.

1027
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,750
Not outside the family.

1028
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,510
This is the first robbery outside
the family.

1029
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:06,710
You stole pizza.

1030
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:08,950
He stole pizza in Karachi.
-One pizza.

1031
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,950
I was very hungry.
-Alright.

1032
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:12,990
So, you stole money,

1033
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:15,150
food and car.

1034
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:18,190
And you say, you are not thieves.

1035
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,270
You claim, you are Indians.

1036
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:22,270
But this is very casual.

1037
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:24,510
Everybody robs small things.

1038
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,070
By the way,
that phone doesn't work.

1039
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:29,270
It might work for you.

1040
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:42,150
They are not lying, sir.

1041
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,750
They are idiots and innocent.

1042
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:49,350
They think Barack Obama is
Morgan Freeman from 'Mandela'.

1043
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,790
How can anybody be so stupid?

1044
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:58,430
They think, you brought them
in for stealing a mobile phone.

1045
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,190
They didn't even know,
it was a detonator.

1046
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:03,210
Oh! This is a good day.

1047
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:05,660
Time for us to take the claim

1048
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:09,910
and win the game. The world will
now see how much they need us.

1049
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,710
God bless America!

1050
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,630
Greetings, you are watching
Indian News.

1051
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:19,110
Welcome to
Tonight with Deepak Chaurasiya.

1052
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:21,150
This news is from Pakistan.

1053
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,830
America has destroyed a big
Taliban camp in Waziristan

1054
01:12:24,957 --> 01:12:26,877
with a huge bomb blast.

1055
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:29,590
<i>Good morning and
welcome to TNA News.</i>

1056
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,470
Last night,
in a covered operation,

1057
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:34,990
American SEALs terminated
twelve big Al-Qaeda leaders'

1058
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:38,270
using only one drone.

1059
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:39,590
So, smell the coffee.

1060
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,470
Once again,
the world is a safe place.

1061
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:47,350
Well done! Congratulations.
Good job.

1062
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:50,190
Good job. Very good. Well done.

1063
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:52,270
Well done.

1064
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:57,390
What? You are not celebrating?

1065
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,350
Wrong! This is wrong.

1066
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:02,150
We haven't even done this.

1067
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,310
What about those two Indians, sir?

1068
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:07,806
Let's give them a medal.

1069
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,910
What are you doing?

1070
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,670
Spider-man stunt.
-Sorry.

1071
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:27,910
Out!

1072
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:37,050
Can we find a taxi here?

1073
01:13:44,957 --> 01:13:47,037
Usually, people
who go in this end up dead.

1074
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,910
It looks like a coffin to me.

1075
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,950
We have reached.
-Good!

1076
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:08,750
It is so suffocating inside,
Shammi.

1077
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:11,310
I wonder how they sit inside.

1078
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,350
Now?
-Indian border

1079
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:20,750
is 5 miles that way.

1080
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,630
Keep walking, and you
will get to the border.

1081
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:24,350
Okay.
-Thank you.

1082
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:26,550
Thank you. Let's go.
-Let's go.

1083
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:31,790
5 miles? 500 miles? Who knows?

1084
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,350
5 miles is approximately
10 kilometres.

1085
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,190
Shammi, would we get a taxi here?

1086
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,020
Good idea!

1087
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:40,790
I am not a traitor, mom.

1088
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:42,870
This doesn't feel right.

1089
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:45,990
The world needs to know this.

1090
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,750
From where did you get this?
-It was lying here.

1091
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:54,470
What is it?
-It is a compass.

1092
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,550
It might be useful.
-Okay.

1093
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:02,950
<i>I have a fantastic friend
who is quite jolly.</i>

1094
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:06,350
<i>Though he is sarcastic,
he is good at heart.</i>

1095
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:09,710
<i>My friend is swanky.
He acts a little hanky-panky.</i>

1096
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:13,030
<i>He loves alcohol, just like me.</i>

1097
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:15,070
<i>Let it be rum or whisky.</i>

1098
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:18,710
<i>We are very risky.</i>

1099
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:23,390
<i>Let it be rum or whisky.
We are very risky.</i>

1100
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:26,870
<i>Thank God,
we are together in this situation.</i>

1101
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:33,670
<i>For me, friendship comes first.</i>

1102
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:36,990
<i>The rest is all secondary.</i>

1103
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:40,430
<i>For me, my friend is my priority.</i>

1104
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:43,750
<i>Nothing can replace him.</i>

1105
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:46,630
<i>For me...</i>

1106
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:49,350
<i>My friend is my priority.</i>

1107
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:53,870
Greetings. Welcome to Karachi TV.

1108
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:55,950
New facts related
to the Waziristan incident

1109
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:57,270
have been revealed.

1110
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,830
This has exposed
America's conspiracy.

1111
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:03,270
A video clip of the Taliban camp
destruction has gone viral'

1112
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:04,950
which clearly shows

1113
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:07,830
that these two gentlemen are
responsible for the destruction,

1114
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,030
not American officers.

1115
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:11,670
The question is
who these gentlemen are.

1116
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:15,990
<i>The Lord is my companion!</i>

1117
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:22,270
<i>The Lord is my master.</i>

1118
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:28,070
<i>Your shrine is always lit
with four lamps...</i>

1119
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:34,830
<i>Your shrine is always lit
with four lamps.</i>

1120
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:38,110
<i>Your shrine is always lit
with four lamps.</i>

1121
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:42,470
<i>And here I come to light
the fifth lamp in Your honour.</i>

1122
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:46,990
<i>O master, O companion and Sire
 of Sindh and Sehwan.</i>

1123
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,710
Shammi!

1124
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,990
Shammi!

1125
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:56,590
<i>The red robed Lord of Qalandar.</i>

1126
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:59,030
<i>Let me sing Your glory.</i>

1127
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:01,430
Shammi!

1128
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:03,550
You could be court-martialled
for this.

1129
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:05,670
With all due respect, commander,

1130
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:09,357
so could you because you
have lied to the world.

1131
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,350
Shammi!

1132
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:19,790
I won't spare you.

1133
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:22,550
You know very well,
I get scared when left alone.

1134
01:17:23,925 --> 01:17:26,885
<i>Don't get lost
in the foreign land.</i>

1135
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:30,710
<i>Stay with me. Don't get lost
in the foreign land.</i>

1136
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:33,910
<i>We have to be with each other.</i>

1137
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:40,670
<i>For me, friendship comes first.</i>

1138
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,430
<i>The rest is all secondary.</i>

1139
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:47,470
<i>For me, my friend is my priority.</i>

1140
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:50,150
<i>Nothing can replace him.</i>

1141
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:53,670
<i>For me...</i>

1142
01:17:54,374 --> 01:17:57,254
<i>Friendship comes first.</i>

1143
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:04,390
<i>Who are these two gentlemen?
Ex-Talibans?</i>

1144
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:07,550
<i>Soldiers?
Or civilians like you and me</i>

1145
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,830
<i>who were frustrated
with terrorists.</i>

1146
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:13,070
<i>When will the government reveal
the truth about them?</i>

1147
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:16,350
Mister.
-Sir...

1148
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:21,670
What does the ministry have
to say about CIA's lead?

1149
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:25,510
Those two men are
the residents of our country.

1150
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:28,002
And they are ready to sacrifice
their lives for the country.

1151
01:18:28,027 --> 01:18:29,990
Why haven't you released
an official report then?

1152
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:32,190
Whenever Pakistan
will be in danger,

1153
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:35,430
the youth of our political
parties have decided

1154
01:18:35,455 --> 01:18:38,255
to lay down their lives in order
 to protect the country.

1155
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,588
Since when did political parties
start hiring such people?

1156
01:18:40,613 --> 01:18:42,845
Since terrorists and
Talibans have assumed

1157
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:44,830
this country to be their playground.

1158
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:48,430
The youth of our political party
have decided

1159
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:52,470
to do everything possible
to protect this country.

1160
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:55,590
Long live Pakistan.

1161
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:00,550
Yes.
-Give the phone to Mr Malik.

1162
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:03,270
Sir, an officer of the intelligence team.

1163
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:08,910
Yes. -Sir, as per
an intelligence report,

1164
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:11,950
the two men whom you have
declared to be Pakistanis

1165
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:14,190
are actually Indians.
-What?

1166
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:16,910
They are Indians?
-We have just got the news.

1167
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:18,390
Are you in your senses?

1168
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:21,190
Absolutely, sir. And I don't
think, they are dangerous.

1169
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:25,070
I will decide who is dangerous 
and who is not.

1170
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:28,630
Your job is to gather information.

1171
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:30,870
And find those men.

1172
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:33,790
They must have reached
India by now.

1173
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:37,990
Shammi, what is this?

1174
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:41,790
Border? It looks like a border.
-It looks like a border.

1175
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,910
This is Pakistan
and that is India.

1176
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:47,150
Shammi, don't you think,
this border is small?

1177
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:50,310
Borders are always small.
Differences are big.

1178
01:19:50,503 --> 01:19:52,423
I cannot see any wire here.

1179
01:19:52,448 --> 01:19:54,270
This place is between India and Pakistan.

1180
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,013
All wires must have been stolen.

1181
01:19:56,076 --> 01:19:57,839
Both of these sides
 are filled with thieves.

1182
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,910
Let's cross the border.
-Hold on.

1183
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:02,910
Let's do it together.
One. Two Three. -Yes.

1184
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:08,670
Yes.
-Yes.

1185
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:12,470
India.
-Fresh.

1186
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:16,190
The grass looks greener on this side.
 I feel so different.

1187
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:19,190
I like it. Today, I realise
the importance of India.

1188
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:20,830
Let me do something.

1189
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,070
What are you doing?

1190
01:20:23,078 --> 01:20:25,198
Hail the Lord...
-Ganesha!

1191
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:27,990
Mr Malik's statement
makes it very clear

1192
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:32,110
that these two gentlemen
who are responsible

1193
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:34,230
<i>for the Waziristan
incident are Pakistanis.</i>

1194
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:37,790
They have been associated with
Pakistan Democratic Front

1195
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,430
<i>and army for a long time.</i>

1196
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:41,630
I love Punjab.
Let's have some buttermilk.

1197
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:44,270
<i>When time came,
they risked their lives</i>

1198
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,150
<i>and successfully completed
this mission.</i>

1199
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:48,750
<i>The ministry has decided</i>

1200
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:51,670
to facilitate them with a reward.

1201
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:57,110
We are back.

1202
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:02,350
I love Punjab. Yeah!

1203
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:04,990
Come on.

1204
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:12,110
What is going on? Silence!

1205
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:29,950
He recognises me.
-Oh God!

1206
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:33,350
Gentlemen, you two are amazing.

1207
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:35,190
Let's have dinner.

1208
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:37,590
People of our country
are so caring.

1209
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:40,590
So much warmth and love can only
be found in our country. -Yes.

1210
01:21:40,982 --> 01:21:43,142
Hail the Lord!

1211
01:21:46,061 --> 01:21:47,901
May I say something?
-Sure.

1212
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:51,670
You have done something
 that even the army couldn't.

1213
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:53,590
Please don't...

1214
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,190
What is he talking about?

1215
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:57,830
Weren't you scared?

1216
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:01,550
We were very scared
when we crossed the border.

1217
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:06,510
Border?

1218
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:09,110
Do you go on the other side
of the border?

1219
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,510
We had gone there by mistake.

1220
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:13,790
Shammi, no matter what you say,

1221
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:15,950
but Pakistan is lovely country.
-Yes.

1222
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:18,030
Yes, it is.
-Too good.

1223
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:20,230
To tell you the truth,

1224
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:23,670
people of India are also very good.

1225
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:27,230
Pakistanis and Indians
are almost the same.

1226
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:30,270
It is the border
that has divided us.

1227
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:32,720
You are right.
-Scoundrels are on both sides.

1228
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,330
It's one and the same.

1229
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:38,950
Amazing! You do great jobs,

1230
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:41,390
yet you are still so grounded.
-Mister...

1231
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,670
That's true.
-Mister?

1232
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:45,510
Yes.

1233
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:47,470
Munniya. Please go.
-Yes.

1234
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:48,910
Come here.

1235
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,150
Is everything fine?

1236
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:08,870
Mister, why are you crying?

1237
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:11,510
What happened?

1238
01:23:11,934 --> 01:23:14,734
He has become emotional.
He has come home after a long time.

1239
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,070
Emotion!
-Go, wash your hand.

1240
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:19,470
You will also understand
what I am going through.

1241
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:21,190
I'll go and wash my hands.

1242
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:36,590
Pakistan?

1243
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,710
What else can I do for you?

1244
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:45,670
What happened to you now?

1245
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:49,150
Shammi, that man is staring at me.

1246
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,830
That man is blind.

1247
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,590
Look. He is also staring at me.

1248
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:01,790
Let it go. That man is a Pathan. 
-Pathan.

1249
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:04,270
Will you have anything sweet?
-Sweet?

1250
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:06,070
Even we would like to have
something sweet.

1251
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:11,910
Get a cold drink.
-Why did you call for string?

1252
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:17,390
I said cold drink, not string.
Will you have it?

1253
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:19,790
No, let it be.

1254
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:23,350
We want to go and meet our uncle.
-Who?

1255
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:24,950
Mr Baloch.

1256
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:28,110
We know only one person in Pakistan.

1257
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:30,070
Mister, can you drop us there?

1258
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:32,550
We can drop you.
-Thank you, sir.

1259
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:34,190
Thank you.
-No.

1260
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:35,870
He will ruin our lives.

1261
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:37,230
I am at your service.

1262
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:39,750
I will arrange for a ride.

1263
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,110
Okay.

1264
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:52,750
Kuber, you are right here.

1265
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:54,550
How are you?

1266
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:56,710
You said we would
never meet again.

1267
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,430
Take us to Mr Baloch.

1268
01:24:58,910 --> 01:24:59,910
Mr Baloch.

1269
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:03,150
<i>Mr Malik has confirmed that
these brave hearts</i>

1270
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:05,270
<i>are Pakistanis.</i>

1271
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:08,470
<i>But the question raised is</i>

1272
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:11,430
<i>where exactly they are and...</i>

1273
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:20,110
Azar!

1274
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,790
Hey!

1275
01:25:25,182 --> 01:25:27,062
Mr Baloch.

1276
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:30,670
Hello, uncle.
-Hi.

1277
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:35,390
What are you doing, Mr Baloch?

1278
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:39,150
What have you done?

1279
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:41,870
Sir, it is Shammi's fault.

1280
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:44,110
He messed with the Pathans.
-Me?

1281
01:25:45,141 --> 01:25:46,621
They were cheering for Afridi.

1282
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,990
They were praising him.

1283
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:50,990
I was getting very irritated.

1284
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:52,830
The patriot inside 
me couldn't tolerate it.

1285
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:55,670
When I get angry,
nothing can stop me.

1286
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:57,390
I abused them...
-Silence!

1287
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:59,710
I won't spare anyone.
-Okay.

1288
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:02,750
I would have shot...
-Silence!

1289
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:09,990
Tell me from the beginning
what exactly happened.

1290
01:26:10,407 --> 01:26:12,150
From the beginning?

1291
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:14,390
That will take a lot of time.

1292
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:16,630
Don't worry about that.

1293
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,710
I have a lot of time.

1294
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:22,350
Sure? Do you want to start
or should I? -I will tell him.

1295
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:25,350
First, Kedar and then me.
-Sir, here I go.

1296
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:28,590
I was born on 1st April, 1988
in Rajkot.

1297
01:26:28,695 --> 01:26:31,215
That was a very shocking event
for Gujarat. -Yes.

1298
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:33,910
I don't want to hear
from the very beginning.

1299
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:37,070
My schooling days?
-No.

1300
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:39,070
Further.
-Okay.

1301
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:41,630
Further.
-Tell him about your youth.

1302
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:42,830
Amazing days!

1303
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:44,950
He...
-Waziristan.

1304
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:46,390
What is Waziristan?

1305
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:51,550
Tell me how you met the Taliban?

1306
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,870
Oh! Shimla!
-Oh God!

1307
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:56,350
Darn it!
-We met a man named Mullah.

1308
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,830
He was very dangerous.

1309
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:01,230
Let me tell you that in detail.

1310
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:24,270
Then we met Zuber and came here.

1311
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:25,990
We came in from that door.

1312
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:27,750
Mind-blowing.
-You were seated here.

1313
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,950
Then you stood up and we hugged.

1314
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:33,630
Then we sat here to eat food,
but I haven't eaten anything yet.

1315
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:34,830
Pass me the kebab.

1316
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:38,830
Sir, how did you know
that we met the Taliban?

1317
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:43,070
Tell us. I want to hear this.

1318
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:45,150
Just like that.

1319
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,310
I guessed.
-Oh!

1320
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:49,950
You are so smart!
-Yes, he is.

1321
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:54,350
Why didn't you inform me,
you were investigating about them?

1322
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:56,510
Sir, I was waiting for results...

1323
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:02,590
Hello.
-Greetings, Mr Malik.

1324
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:05,510
Who is this?
-This is Azar Baloch.

1325
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,350
Hello, Mr Baloch.

1326
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:09,790
What reminds you of me today?

1327
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:12,230
I always had the desire

1328
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:16,150
to be a part of the ministry.

1329
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:20,830
Forgive me. But this desire of
yours won't ever be fulfilled.

1330
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:25,030
The two fools whom you have
declared to be Pakistanis

1331
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:29,270
are in my house right now,
having lunch.

1332
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:31,990
What?

1333
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:38,870
What do you want?
-Election ticket.

1334
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:41,750
You will get it,
but you won't win.

1335
01:28:42,133 --> 01:28:44,733
Send someone to get these men.

1336
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:48,070
As far as being a part of ministry
is concerned,

1337
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:50,790
leave that to me.

1338
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:58,470
So, you wanted results.
-Yes.

1339
01:28:58,670 --> 01:29:01,190
I wish, the Lord had blessed
you with some brains

1340
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:02,990
along with that beautiful face.

1341
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:07,910
I believe, those two are civilians.

1342
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:09,710
Keep your views to yourself.

1343
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:13,910
I will have to tolerate Azar Baloch
because of your foolishness.

1344
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:17,190
Go and make the Pakistani
passports for those two men.

1345
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:20,550
But, sir, as per law...
-Now, you will teach me law?

1346
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,990
I make the law for this country.

1347
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:24,950
Let me handle the situation.

1348
01:29:25,062 --> 01:29:28,142
Hand over your report
 to your junior officer, Asma Siddiqui.

1349
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:35,470
You have all the details
of this case.

1350
01:29:35,630 --> 01:29:37,790
These two gentlemen are locked
in ward number three.

1351
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:39,550
Mr Malik wants

1352
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:43,430
that their identities are not
to be made public at any cost.

1353
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:48,630
Oh Lord!

1354
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:58,070
No. Please.

1355
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:06,110
Why are you torturing us?

1356
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:08,870
What are you doing?

1357
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:17,190
You will do what we say.

1358
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:21,150
Let them freshen up 
and then take their measurements. -Okay.

1359
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:27,150
I thank you all for
coming here today.

1360
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:30,360
I present to you the brave hearts
who fought the Taliban.

1361
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,460
They are true patriots.

1362
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:36,590
These men risked
their lives to complete

1363
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:39,510
their mission successfully.

1364
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:41,990
The true sons of this country...

1365
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:46,910
What did you say their names are?
-Names?

1366
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:51,710
Colonel Itefaaq
and Colonel Wahtafaq Baloch.

1367
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:55,270
Colonel Itefaaq

1368
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:58,270
and Colonel Wahtafaq.

1369
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:02,430
Long live Pakistan!

1370
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:15,950
This world is filled with evil

1371
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:18,110
and sinners,

1372
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:21,110
but only a true hero

1373
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:24,190
spreads joy all around.

1374
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:27,630
Please raise your hands
to ask questions.

1375
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:30,230
Sir.
-Mr Malik.

1376
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:31,950
Sir.
-Mr Malik.

1377
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:34,830
Shahnawaz! -Where were you
trained for this mission?

1378
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,590
At our base in Abbottabad.

1379
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:39,510
The same place where you had
hidden Osama Bin Laden?

1380
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:41,390
Next question.
-Sir!

1381
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:43,110
Sir... Please listen to me.

1382
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:44,910
Please, sir.
-Ma'am, ask your question.

1383
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:46,990
My question to you is,

1384
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,750
what is your choice in music?

1385
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:52,110
Do you like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan
or Atif Aslam? -Ma'am!

1386
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:56,990
Since their childhood,
Pakistani intelligence agencies

1387
01:31:57,310 --> 01:31:59,670
made them hear sounds of bullets

1388
01:31:59,901 --> 01:32:02,501
and bomb blasts on headphones,

1389
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:05,630
all day long for many years.

1390
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:07,910
That is the only music
they have heard.

1391
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:09,110
Next!

1392
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,310
Can you tell us about your parents?

1393
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:14,750
You fool! I am their parent
and guardian.

1394
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:17,550
I am Mr Azar Baloch.

1395
01:32:17,630 --> 01:32:20,470
Please ask your question.
-Are you married?

1396
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:22,310
That is a personal question.

1397
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:24,550
Please spare them.

1398
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:28,790
That's enough.

1399
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:32,070
Now, these two courageous officers

1400
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:34,830
would like to say something
to the world.

1401
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:41,950
Hail...
-Pakistan.

1402
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:43,590
Applaud!

1403
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:50,790
Long live Pakistan.

1404
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:57,630
Attention, everyone. These brave
soldiers represent our PDF party.

1405
01:32:58,286 --> 01:33:02,206
Hail the brave hearts.

1406
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:05,590
Hail the brave hearts.

1407
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,550
Long live Pakistan.

1408
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,470
Hail...

1409
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:17,190
Pakistan.

1410
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:20,390
<i>This man is Kedar Patel,</i>

1411
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:23,790
'born to the family of
Mitesh Patel in Jamnagar.'

1412
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:26,310
His friend is Shammi Thakur.

1413
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:28,870
The question is why
Pakistan claims them

1414
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:31,150
to be the heroes
of their country.

1415
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:33,763
Yasir Ali from Jiah TV
is here with us today

1416
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:36,790
to give us some more
information on this case.

1417
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:40,310
Yasir, Kedar's father,
Mitesh Patel claims

1418
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:42,630
that they had left Jamnagar
in a yacht.

1419
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:45,070
Due to turbulence in weather,

1420
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:47,350
they reached Pakistan by mistake

1421
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:49,630
That's strange, Deepak.

1422
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:52,070
Is it easy to destroy
a Taliban camp?

1423
01:33:52,190 --> 01:33:54,790
Think about it. One can
neither enter Pakistan

1424
01:33:54,910 --> 01:33:56,790
nor destroy Taliban
camp by mistake.

1425
01:33:56,950 --> 01:34:00,110
My friend, they are trained
Pakistani soldiers.

1426
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:02,990
Allow me to introduce
their family to you.

1427
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:04,700
She is Colonel Itefaaq's mom.

1428
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:06,750
This is his aunt.

1429
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:09,790
<i>This is the family of Colonel
Itefaaq. That is his uncle.</i>

1430
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:13,070
His brother and that's her niece.

1431
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:16,150
Look at them.
Look at these innocent faces.

1432
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:17,510
Do you want more proof?

1433
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:21,790
<i>It is high time Indian media
should check their facts,</i>

1434
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:25,550
correct any error,
and not try to claim...

1435
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:27,710
Yasir? Hello?

1436
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:31,780
There seems to be
a technical problem.

1437
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:34,590
Or he has disconnected the line

1438
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:37,662
<i>because he has no answer
to our questions.'</i>

1439
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:39,590
But as you can see,

1440
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:42,030
this has become
a serious matter.

1441
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:51,430
My Lord, I welcome you
to this gathering.

1442
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:56,310
Forget bullets and bombs
and relax your minds.

1443
01:34:56,710 --> 01:35:01,670
I am here only to entertain you.

1444
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,800
<i>My evenings are
like the evenings in Awadh.</i>

1445
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:32,364
<i>My mornings are
like the mornings of Benaras.</i>

1446
01:35:32,607 --> 01:35:35,914
<i>I've stolen
the nights from Mumbai.</i>

1447
01:35:36,195 --> 01:35:39,627
<i>I've stolen
the nights from Mumbai.</i>

1448
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:43,543
<i>Lahore's glow on my cheeks,
I've got earrings from Baloch.</i>

1449
01:35:43,839 --> 01:35:46,210
<i>My beauty you could die for!</i>

1450
01:35:47,365 --> 01:35:50,564
<i>From Pindi to Delhi,..</i>

1451
01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:54,572
<i>...boys call me Shakira
from Karachi!</i>

1452
01:35:55,305 --> 01:35:57,006
<i>Shakira.</i>

1453
01:35:57,026 --> 01:36:00,068
<i>Shakira.</i>

1454
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,680
<i>I wanna drink, I wanna dance.</i>

1455
01:36:18,986 --> 01:36:22,204
<i>Give me what you can.</i>

1456
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,744
<i>I am a beauty,
you are a hottie.</i>

1457
01:36:26,054 --> 01:36:29,189
<i>Beware!
You will lose yourself.</i>

1458
01:36:29,485 --> 01:36:32,870
<i>Even the worst of scoundrels...</i>

1459
01:36:33,151 --> 01:36:36,177
<i>...turn to God for me.</i>

1460
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:39,860
<i>From Pindi to Delhi,..</i>

1461
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:43,720
<i>...boys call me Shakira
from Karachi!</i>

1462
01:36:44,524 --> 01:36:47,457
<i>Shakira!</i>

1463
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:03,550
Come with me now.

1464
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:07,950
These people
are going to kill both of you.

1465
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:09,830
Just leave. Leave now.

1466
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:16,510
<i>Liar!
You are nothing but a liar.</i>

1467
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:18,870
<i>Do you even realise
how embarrassing it is</i>

1468
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:20,510
<i>facing the President for this?</i>

1469
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:22,270
<i>Intelligence report says,</i>

1470
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,630
<i>the Taliban are planning
fresh attacks.</i>

1471
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:28,110
<i>And all of this because you left
those two fools in that country.</i>

1472
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:31,030
<i>Now, get out there
and clean up this mess.</i>

1473
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:34,430
Shammi, I am very tired.

1474
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:37,030
I am missing my dad.

1475
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:39,790
I am bored of this place. Please.

1476
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:42,390
Please take me back home.

1477
01:37:44,823 --> 01:37:45,903
That is your problem.

1478
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:48,710
You are always dependent on others.

1479
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:51,830
You are dependent on your dad
and others.

1480
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:53,350
Why don't you become independent?

1481
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:55,350
What do you mean?

1482
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:59,230
Had I known the way back home,
I would have gone myself.

1483
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:01,150
Kedar,

1484
01:38:03,101 --> 01:38:04,661
since I have met you,

1485
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:07,390
I have lived my life like you.

1486
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:09,990
If we want to get out
alive from here,

1487
01:38:12,095 --> 01:38:16,470
you have to think like me for once.

1488
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:18,550
Please get serious in life.

1489
01:38:21,110 --> 01:38:23,150
Shammi.
-Yes.

1490
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:27,110
Can I ask something?
-Sure.

1491
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:31,310
Will you tell me the truth?
-Yes.

1492
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:37,430
Are we going to die?

1493
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:41,270
Are you mad?

1494
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:43,950
That won't happen.

1495
01:38:46,030 --> 01:38:47,430
All will be well.

1496
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:40,110
My poor Itefaaq!

1497
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:43,390
Poor Wahtafaq!

1498
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:49,630
I didn't know the Taliban would
take this matter so seriously.

1499
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:54,470
They actually abducted them.
-Stop pretending.

1500
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:57,230
There are 20 days to go
for the elections.

1501
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:59,510
How much more will we use them?

1502
01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:03,110
So?
-I don't know what to do now.

1503
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:04,890
I am asking you.

1504
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:11,390
Shammi, it's too dark in here.
Are we dead?

1505
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:13,950
I have never died before.
I have no idea.

1506
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:21,630
Guns? Black?
-They are dressed like Talibans.

1507
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:24,070
White? Black?
-They don't look like Talibans.

1508
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:28,910
White?
They all are different races.

1509
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:34,590
Talibans also look like Americans.

1510
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:36,310
I...
-Shut up!

1511
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:40,190
Who blew up the Taliban camp?

1512
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:42,270
We didn't.
-We didn't.

1513
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:46,310
Who blew up the Taliban camp?

1514
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:48,710
You did that.

1515
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:51,350
Are you sure?
-Of course, we are.

1516
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:53,950
We saw you doing that.

1517
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:57,270
I know, it was you who did it.

1518
01:40:57,670 --> 01:40:59,390
Yes. Remember,

1519
01:40:59,510 --> 01:41:02,990
I was trying to call my dad from
that cell phone and... -Quiet!

1520
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:07,350
If I send you back to India,
will you tell them that we did it?

1521
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:10,270
Of course, we will tell them.
We are not scared. -Absolutely.

1522
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:12,630
I will get it printed
in all newspapers.

1523
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:16,630
I will personally message everybody
and tell them, you did it.

1524
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:19,390
So, you will let the media know,
we did it.

1525
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:22,030
I will tell uncle Jignesh,
aunt Jayshree

1526
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:23,830
and all my cousins in Jamnagar.

1527
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:25,110
Got it?

1528
01:41:25,190 --> 01:41:27,550
Boys, pack your bags.

1529
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:30,510
You are going back to India.
-But we don't want to go.

1530
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:33,070
What?
-No one respects us there.

1531
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:35,670
Here, we are in great demand.
The ISI wants us,

1532
01:41:35,790 --> 01:41:37,430
and so do the Talibans.
We don't want to go.

1533
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:39,790
When we wanted to go,
what did you do?

1534
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:41,990
You left us in a dessert to die.
-Right.

1535
01:41:42,085 --> 01:41:44,925
I would rather trust Pakistanis
than you. -Come on.

1536
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:46,430
What happened to him?

1537
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:49,110
We won't go.

1538
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:50,750
Okay, boys.

1539
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:57,460
I am sorry.

1540
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,240
I am very sorry.

1541
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:01,270
We don't trust you.

1542
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:06,350
Yes. I might trust my father once
but not you.

1543
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:09,270
The GPS in his tank wasn't working.

1544
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:10,870
Don't give us excuses.

1545
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:12,630
He could have asked someone
for directions.

1546
01:42:12,769 --> 01:42:14,110
Who was driving the tank?

1547
01:42:14,175 --> 01:42:15,790
Him.
-Fire him.

1548
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:18,030
Okay. Gary, you are fired.

1549
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:20,910
He is not working for me anymore.
-Good one.

1550
01:42:21,110 --> 01:42:24,030
I need someone. Can I have you?
-Sure.

1551
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:26,030
What do I have to do

1552
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:30,070
so that you fine gentlemen
get out of here

1553
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:33,230
and are not seen in this country anymore?

1554
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:39,590
Give us five seconds.

1555
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:48,670
We want to go back by Air India.

1556
01:42:48,990 --> 01:42:52,270
Air India doesn't fly from here.
-We don't care.

1557
01:42:52,727 --> 01:42:54,950
Okay.
-And we want two separate cabins

1558
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:57,310
with double beds
and big screen televisions.

1559
01:42:57,390 --> 01:42:58,750
Are you serious?
-Yes.

1560
01:42:58,830 --> 01:43:00,430
And I want to watch
only Hindi films.

1561
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:03,710
The plane shouldn't land
before my film ends.

1562
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:06,630
It will continue
to stay up in the air,

1563
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:08,590
and finally land in Gujarat.

1564
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:10,790
Multiple choices in food,

1565
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:14,150
vegetarian and non-vegetarian.
At least 25 dishes.

1566
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:17,670
I'll see what I can do on that one.

1567
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:20,670
Normal, good-looking air-hostess.

1568
01:43:20,741 --> 01:43:22,301
Wait a second.
Now, you are pushing it.

1569
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:23,630
You are going a bit too far.

1570
01:43:23,725 --> 01:43:24,925
Dancers.
-No way.

1571
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:26,310
Good cutlery.
-No way.

1572
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:28,710
Clean bathroom.
-Darn it! That's impossible.

1573
01:43:31,141 --> 01:43:33,621
Alright. We'll fly in any airline.

1574
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:36,150
Thanks. I suppose, now,
you would be wanting

1575
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:38,150
American passports.
-No.

1576
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:40,950
I want Indian passport

1577
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:45,950
with multiple entry,
life-time American visa.

1578
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:48,030
And you?

1579
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:50,630
Dual citizenship.
-India and America?

1580
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:54,550
America and UK?
-I too want that.

1581
01:43:54,670 --> 01:43:56,550
For both of us. Thank you.

1582
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:06,390
Do you have a gun?
-I always carry a gun, sir.

1583
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:08,950
Do you want to shoot them?
-I want to shoot myself.

1584
01:44:09,030 --> 01:44:10,550
Shall I load the gun for you?

1585
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:14,540
Dorothy, I want you
to get them ready,

1586
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:16,270
and send them home.

1587
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:19,230
This time, for real.

1588
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:12,430
Thank you and have a safe journey.
-Thank you.

1589
01:45:22,048 --> 01:45:23,710
Will you go to India
without a passport?

1590
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:30,510
Thank you.
-Thank you.

1591
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:37,990
It didn't make any noise
when it fell.

1592
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:40,230
Hence, I didn't realise it.
I'll keep it safe.

1593
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:42,750
You cannot handle yourself.
How will you handle a passport?

1594
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:45,070
I can't handle this bag either.

1595
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:47,470
When the bag falls,
it will make noise. Let's go.

1596
01:46:26,030 --> 01:46:28,670
When did you come to Pakistan?
-Never.

1597
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:31,870
I was sent on the other
side during the partition.

1598
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:36,510
Stand on this side,
facing the camera.

1599
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:52,550
Security, his passport is fake.
Take him away.

1600
01:46:55,430 --> 01:46:56,630
Next please.

1601
01:46:57,190 --> 01:46:58,590
Show me your passport.

1602
01:46:59,470 --> 01:47:00,750
Thank you.

1603
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:20,470
Stand on this side,
facing the camera.

1604
01:47:21,083 --> 01:47:22,670
Take off your glasses.

1605
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:26,870
Please come back.

1606
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:32,310
What made you come to Pakistan?

1607
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:38,750
My yacht drowned in the sea
because of a cyclone,

1608
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:40,710
and I swam all the way to Pakistan.

1609
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:44,510
You have a great sense of humour.

1610
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:53,510
Here is your passport.
Have a good day.

1611
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:54,990
Thank you.
-You too.

1612
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:57,150
You have to go this way.
-I know.

1613
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:11,150
Oh no!
-What?

1614
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:12,470
Look there.

1615
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:15,630
The Taliban delivery man.
-Where?

1616
01:48:16,808 --> 01:48:18,590
Remember we had seen
him with the Talibans.

1617
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:21,230
Let's confront him.
-Shammi, wait.

1618
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:25,750
Mr Delivery Man.

1619
01:48:26,190 --> 01:48:28,550
How are you? Did you recognise us?

1620
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:30,390
Itefaaq and Wahtafaq.

1621
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,350
Sorry?

1622
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:34,190
Shammi, how would he recognise us?
-Why?

1623
01:48:34,270 --> 01:48:36,070
We don't look like Itefaaq and Wahtafaq.

1624
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:39,430
Hold on!
-Remember,

1625
01:48:39,494 --> 01:48:41,390
you had come to delivery
a consignment to Aaga.

1626
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:43,830
I had asked you if you deliver 
pizza as well,

1627
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:46,030
and you got so annoyed.
Do you remember?

1628
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:47,710
Did you? Hold on.

1629
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:51,430
Now?

1630
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:55,150
Now? Hold on.

1631
01:49:02,404 --> 01:49:04,310
Guys, I think, you got
the wrong person.

1632
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:05,550
I got a flight to take.

1633
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:07,950
Really? -Sorry.

1634
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:13,430
He turned from
a delivery boy to pilot!

1635
01:49:14,230 --> 01:49:17,670
So what? Even you turned 
from a Navy officer to a Taliban.

1636
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:19,710
But in my heart,
I am still a Navy officer.

1637
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:22,030
And I am a Gujarati.

1638
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:26,910
Then, that man is definitely
a Taliban at heart. -Yes.

1639
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:33,590
Something is going to happen here.
Believe me, Kedar.

1640
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:35,310
Shammi, this is Karachi.

1641
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:37,230
Something or the other
happens here every day.

1642
01:49:58,950 --> 01:50:00,710
Greetings.
-Greetings.

1643
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:03,030
Is the flight on time?
-Yes.

1644
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:04,270
Thank you.
-Thank you.

1645
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:08,390
Something is definitely wrong.

1646
01:50:09,870 --> 01:50:12,990
Shammi, I just want
to go back to India.

1647
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:18,070
Something is wrong.

1648
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:27,110
Sorry, sir. This child was playing,

1649
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:29,470
and she threw the ball at you.
-That is no problem.

1650
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:31,830
Very sorry.
-Where are you off to? Picnic?

1651
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:33,230
No, it is not a picnic.

1652
01:50:33,310 --> 01:50:35,950
We are taking our team
to London for Paralympics.

1653
01:50:36,030 --> 01:50:37,990
Okay.
-All the best.

1654
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:42,790
She says, thank you.
-Tell her to get the trophy.

1655
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:44,350
How cute!

1656
01:50:45,413 --> 01:50:48,293
She says, she will definitely win.
Thank you. -Good.

1657
01:50:48,478 --> 01:50:50,718
All the best. Have a safe flight.
-You too.

1658
01:51:01,310 --> 01:51:02,670
Goodbye.

1659
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:04,870
All the best.

1660
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:08,230
All the best. Bye.

1661
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:12,710
All the best. Bye.
-Thank you.

1662
01:51:17,150 --> 01:51:19,870
Kedar, that Taliban guy is also taking
 the same flight.

1663
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:23,350
Something is just not right.

1664
01:51:24,390 --> 01:51:28,670
Shammi, these kids are going 
for Paralympics. What is not right?

1665
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:32,790
I am talking about that
Taliban guy, not these kids.

1666
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:35,670
What if he does something
in the flight?

1667
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:37,870
But he is a changed man.

1668
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:40,190
Even you saw that he has
become a pilot now.

1669
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:45,310
Alright.
Let's suppose you are right.

1670
01:51:45,999 --> 01:51:50,399
But what if he is still
a Taliban at heart?

1671
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:59,830
Shammi, it wouldn't be right
with these kids.

1672
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:02,110
That is what I am saying.

1673
01:52:05,470 --> 01:52:08,870
But we have to go home, right?

1674
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:11,830
What about the kids?

1675
01:52:14,070 --> 01:52:15,150
It is a risk.

1676
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:17,310
We could die.

1677
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:22,550
If we had to die, we would've died
when we were with Taliban or ISI.

1678
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:24,974
But we did not. We are still here.

1679
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:26,670
Nothing will happen.

1680
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:32,310
If we save these kids,

1681
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:34,110
our lie would be caught.

1682
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:36,470
But if we stay here,

1683
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:38,630
we will go back home.

1684
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:43,510
I cannot go home
with a heavy heart.

1685
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:47,070
You can stay if you want.
I am going.

1686
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:49,710
Shammi!

1687
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:55,630
Don't underestimate
the power of a Gujarati.

1688
01:52:59,070 --> 01:53:00,030
Good boy!

1689
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:01,470
What do we do now?

1690
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:04,070
First, we have to inform
Officer Shazia.

1691
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:05,590
Okay.

1692
01:53:05,670 --> 01:53:09,110
And I will stop the pilot.
-Okay.

1693
01:53:09,270 --> 01:53:11,950
But...
-How will I do that?

1694
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:15,190
You are Colonel Itefaaq.
You can do anything.

1695
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:17,750
Yes. Think of something.
-Yes.

1696
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:20,230
Come with me. Watch me.
-Where?

1697
01:53:21,990 --> 01:53:23,870
Is this the way you wear a cap?

1698
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:30,190
What are you doing? Listen to me.

1699
01:53:32,310 --> 01:53:35,310
What are you doing?
I am Colonel Itefaaq.

1700
01:53:35,590 --> 01:53:37,390
Get back! Look.

1701
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:39,270
Sir!
-Sir!

1702
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:41,790
I said, I am on a secret mission,
but you refuse to hear me.

1703
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:42,950
Call Officer Shazia.

1704
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:45,270
Yes, sir.
-Others, follow me.

1705
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:46,590
Come on.

1706
01:53:51,510 --> 01:53:53,030
Hey!

1707
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:56,110
Greetings!

1708
01:53:56,550 --> 01:53:59,270
Itefaaq and Wahtafaq
are at the Karachi airport.

1709
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:01,070
They have identified me.

1710
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:04,190
Activate plan B.

1711
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:09,870
Catch him.
-Sir, your boarding pass.

1712
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:11,870
Ma'am, your boarding pass.
Thank you.

1713
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:13,630
Boarding pass, please.

1714
01:54:17,830 --> 01:54:20,030
Stop him!

1715
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:22,510
Stop!

1716
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:29,630
You!

1717
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:34,550
Hey!
-I know you are not a pilot.

1718
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:17,260
Wahtafaq!

1719
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:19,260
I am here, my friend.

1720
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:07,950
Kedar, pass me the magazine.

1721
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:09,440
Throw it.

1722
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:12,740
Cover me.
I have to stop the Taliban guy.

1723
01:56:13,090 --> 01:56:14,210
Okay.

1724
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:20,220
Nobody moves.

1725
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:21,600
Hey, you!

1726
01:57:00,830 --> 01:57:02,710
Go on, Shammi!
I'll stop them!

1727
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:19,390
Easy! We're here to help you.

1728
01:57:30,956 --> 01:57:33,141
Air hostess, close the gate!

1729
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:34,700
Where's the pilot?

1730
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:38,480
The door is open.
Someone help!

1731
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,870
Where's the cockpit?
-Upstairs.

1732
01:57:58,250 --> 01:57:59,600
Come on!

1733
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:24,950
Shammi!

1734
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,120
Goodbye.

1735
01:58:46,230 --> 01:58:48,510
Why did you hit the pilot so hard?

1736
01:58:48,630 --> 01:58:51,470
I came to save you.
-Who will land the plane now?

1737
01:58:51,590 --> 01:58:53,750
Who is flying the plane?
-No idea!

1738
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:12,070
Shammi, do we have
to take a left or right?

1739
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:13,750
I think, we should go straight.

1740
01:59:14,670 --> 01:59:16,910
If we take two rights,
we'll get back to the same place.

1741
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:19,630
If you don't mind,
can I say something?

1742
01:59:19,710 --> 01:59:21,750
Sure.
-Take a left.

1743
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:25,150
<i>Run, else...</i>

1744
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:29,830
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

1745
01:59:32,510 --> 01:59:35,990
<i>Run, else you will be dead.</i>

1746
01:59:36,070 --> 01:59:39,670
<i>Run, else you will be doomed.</i>

1747
01:59:47,774 --> 01:59:53,574
<i>La La... La La...
This is a lullaby.</i>

1748
01:59:55,190 --> 02:00:01,030
<i>La La... La La...
This is a lullaby.</i>

1749
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:04,270
<i>My mom says to come home
