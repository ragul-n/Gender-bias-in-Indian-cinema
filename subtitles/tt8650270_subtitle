00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,960
My name is Karthik

3
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,150
I, too, are like you
Keeping a goal in life

4
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,280
It was very tiring for this

5
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,730
There is not much to do with what I meant

6
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
When we do what we think

7
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,550
We can not say the joy we feel

8
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,730
But at the same time,
If a person does

9
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,970
Words can not be said

10
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,110
Megan

11
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,190
How far do I go?

12
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,660
It's coming all the way

13
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,950
In his sorrow

14
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,440
To the extent of going

15
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,690
Sir, I'm scared of the office, sir
It's like going to school when you were younger

16
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,200
Last week, nine employees left, sir

17
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,610
This week, there are 3 people

18
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,540
Very unfair

19
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,970
There's a Tramp in America
This is what Karthik kills us

20
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,110
Good morning, nobody said
I will not make any comment, sir

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,710
You need to control a little, sir

22
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,980
Stay in fear every day
It's the same, sir

23
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,230
Karthik does not have enough capacity
My wife remembers sir

24
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,910
Take

25
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,060
Thank you, sir

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,420
Your senior servant
Your grief comes to me

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,320
But what does he have to do with that power?

28
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,950
One way to do this is Karthik
Remove one employee

29
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,340
You're all giving him a boost
To resign the entire team

30
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,190
And then Karthik will have to explain to Boss

31
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,360
You're someone else's job
Atahori tomorrow will lose your job

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,370
Right?
Okay, sir

33
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,150
As you said, we were together
We will face Karttyk

34
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,220
But in this case, in the bosom
We need your help, sir

35
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300
There's 100% of it

36
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,880
Sir, the manager is coming

37
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,740
Karthik is coming out here
Why is it?

38
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,510

Mister

118
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,360
Come to cabin for a bit
- All right

119
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,590
Prakash sent you a document to see it
- Right, sir

120
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,450
Karthik

121
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,730
You can not take me out of here

Shit

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,980
I am also Senior and Stable employee
This company

124
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,940
I have a clarification ... I need an explanation

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,900
This is your decision
If it's my decision, then listen

128
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,040
If I get out of this company, me
Then the clients are taken out

Well

135
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,840

137
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,550
Hi Sri

138
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,130
Stay

139
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,300
Hi ..
Hi

140
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,260
Today is our birthday

141
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Who are you?

142
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,100
There's 202 on your next block

143
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,270
New arrivals?

144
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,490
Yes, it's been two years

145
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Hello

146
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,970
Yes, check out the documents for a week
I'll send the rest of the money

147
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,800
Quickly decide

148
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,250
Ov..suvar..anivāryayenma

149
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
And

150
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,460
Sorry, sir

151
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,140
Completion of 4 projects within 6 months
It's one of the hardest things to do

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,130
Very soon after deciding one
If not completed

153
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,890
It's a big problem

154
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,450
That impact also affects the future of our company

155
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,420
My place may also be at risk

156
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
No problem, sir

157
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,440
If we work hard, we have to stay
It's easy with the staff

158
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,700
Karthik or okay, sir. We can do it

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I know Akil

160
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,470
But within the next three months, from you
One has been promoted

161
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,050
There's a chance to go to America

162
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,090
Then that pressure is one of them
It's my fault

163
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,470
Trust me, sir

164
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,300
We're both American to anyone
The rest will take that responsibility

165
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,460
Yes, sir

166
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,610
All right

167
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,190
Thank you guys

168
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,210
Bye sir

Sir

171
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,100
The head office is very impressed with your work

172
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,980
You've been waiting for a long time
The American dream too will not be far off

173
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,640
best wishes
- Thank you, sir

174
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,930
Yes, dad

175
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,170
Tell

176
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,770
Come on, Grandmother
I was able to inspect my mind

177
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,870
Night sleep
Have you been drinking tea?

178
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,900
These barges are less than that

179
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,560

180
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,260

Hey, Suda

181
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,510
brother in law

182
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,030
Tell the cousin
How are you?

183
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,160
How are you, my lady brother?

184
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,130
Because I'm okay

185
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,900
If you come to Hyderabad, you come home

186
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,220
Definitely the cousin

187
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,850
Take Dad's tea

188
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,220
What kind of stuff are you?

189
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,100
We got your daughter to our Katik
You think so?

190
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,980
Your daddy's his sister
See what happened

191
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,670
You're your daughter again
Why are you trying to bring Karthik?

192
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,830
Even if she is a fellow, I say this
Understand it

193
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,150
Mr. Sutakar is in our neighborhood village
A suggestion of the husband of the house

194
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,740
His elder son has a job in Bangalore

195
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,730
If you tell me, I'm gone now
I'll talk to you

196
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,220
Talk about my daughter's marriage
Did you say Okay?

197
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,620
My son's son is mine
The future nephew told me

198
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,850
Everyone is looking at it

199
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,190
I have jobs. I'll go

200
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Mr. Sutker

201
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,020
Why is your sister's son sacrificing your daughter?

202
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,500
Who's trying to get to America?
You know what you want

203
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,740
Yes, Uncle
- Yes

204
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,950
The decree is to check it
Karthik

205
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,390
Ok if it does not work, call again

206
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,540
Yes, uncle

207
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,670
It's okay to know that this is not right at this time, but it's not wrong

208
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,280
Years ago I had to talk to you and I wanted to ask again

209
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,600
Tell me, how will this one turn up?

210
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,070
What about uncle?

211
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
that's it

212
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,170
My daughter is safe to think about giving you a tumbler

213
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,280
What do you mean?

214
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,170
Why do not you talk?

215
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,130
If my friend were alive today, I will not be able to get this situation

216
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,960
Your mother has confirmed her

217
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,980
And this is the only decision I made
Not a decision we made together

218
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,510
If you do not want to leave
I'll see a different connection

219
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,510
If you wish, that's right, uncle

220
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,260
interested in?

221
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,620
What are you doing now?

222
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,820
Bse psychologically

223
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,550
Ah ..

224
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
That's not it

225
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
Um ..

226
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,810
I like Rajesh very much

227
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,460
I'm thinking of marrying him

228
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,030
All right, go get the point
Tell your dad

229
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,240
I do not like marrying too much

230
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,510
Please ... Do not say that

231
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,640
As a matter of fact, you need to save me

232
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,330
Dad would love to know this
I will not be able to face me either

233
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,990
Understand Brotherhood

234
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,790
Please

235
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,910
If I say I do not like it

236
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,690
Uncle will give you a court order
How is it?

237
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,310
Do the cousin

238
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,910
Because my dad loved me a lot

239
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,330
You're about to get yourself photographed because of his promise

240
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,420
If you tell her his nephew can not be
His promise would be useless

241
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,590
Then allows me to do it

242
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,840
Oh, my lord

243
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,550
What's the matter?

244
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,810
You do not have anything, Dad

245
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,620
Got to leave

246
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Sit

247
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,230
Go for a coffee

248
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,640
Dad, you can stop that cigarette

249
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,100
Stop smoking at the cigarette and need more?

250
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,570
This is just the moment when your mom was away from me

251
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,880
Stay alone

252
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,210
To drink

253
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,660
It's not when Dad lost his mother
Why did not you marry?

254
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,970
What about my marriage then?

255
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,110
Now think about your marriage

256
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,710
I do not like this wedding, Dad

257
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,180
Why do not you say why?

258
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,830
Last night I told you I like unity, right?

259
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,340
When we are in trouble, yours is yours
Uncle helped me a lot

260
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Today if you're like this

261
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,880
That's why your uncle is

262
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,950
Let's do what's best for me, Dad. Dad
- Now that's Bun?

263
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,180
I am without him
How are you, Dad

264
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,290
that's it

265
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,330
Why do not you like it?

266
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,420
What's wrong with him?
Learned beautiful

267
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,650
Where would a better kid come from?

268
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,820
Hail, Dad

269
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,680
I like him very much

270
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,390
He's also in my office

271
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,900
I'm thinking of marrying him

272
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,620
He's very big

273
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,070
Yes, dad

274
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,000
Who wants a girlfriend
You said there, right?

275
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,210
I want to see those kids

276
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,800
I want to talk to that kid

277
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,470
I'm coming to Hyderabad for two days

278
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,380
Dad, that's not it

279
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,070
Coming

280
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,470
You know, this is an award winning short film

281
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,320
The office did not come as it was
Can work just fine day

282
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
'' Without sleep ''

283
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,080
Sir Karthike, sir

284
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,500
for me?
As if you had an opportunity to get comments from your director

285
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,520
You're already scared to stay safe

286
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,160
What's with the girls?

287
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,030
Which girl, Kartik

288
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,360
What was that girl saying?

289
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,160
That means I could not
He explained and gave it

290
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,270
It's my personal thing with you
Think about dividing

291
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,780
Yes, definitely Karthik

292
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,780
Do you know what my things are with you?

293
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,220
Of course I was from your early childhood
Your class was friends and your friend

294
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,870
My job is in your hands ..

295
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,460
Another is good friends
And that's all it was in that class

296
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,160
What's the point?

297
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,750
<i> My daughter is yelling at you
Think twice. </ I>

298
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,030
<i> Rajesh I really like </ i>

299
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,960
<i> I like him, dad </ i>

300
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,100
<i> I told a girl that she was willing to go?
I want to meet the child </ i>

301
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,170
<i> I need to talk to that girl with </ i>

302
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,210
I've mastered Karthik

303
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,970
At first you trusted me so much
Thank you very much for the project, Karthik

304
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,640
One day, give me one day

305
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,690
It needs to be firm and firm

306
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,330
She's still here?

307
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,860
It's all set to late at night

308
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,370
Dad

309
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,900
If this wedding happens, I'll die, Dad

310
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,950
If you do not get married, we will die

311
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,980
What are you frightening about?

312
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,330
Give me that glass. I'll drink and die

313
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,450
This is you, Dad

314
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Mǣgī

315
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,130
I'm looking for you all around the tabernacle
Are you both here and drinking drinks?

316
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,580
What are you waiting for?

317
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,620
Your daughter does not like this whore

318
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,560
If you marry, they will die and die

319
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,300
That means you have not forgotten Idwan now

320
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,330
We're trying to sew our face
Why do you die for that?

321
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,230
I want to kill you

322
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,810
It's for you

323
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,380
Because you guys are kinda like that

324
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,590
How many kids are like

325
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,860
Do not get married

326
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,450
She always lives in the house of her mother and is dead

327
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,370
Today you die

328
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,080
You're all like parents
It's a lesson

329
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,240
See how your daughter loves us

330
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,310
You see?

331
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,450
Your loved one loves us

332
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,890
Sorry, sorry

333
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,310
Mēgnā

334
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Megna, please

335
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,320
See how your daughter loves us

336
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,840
Ma'am, it's just one shot, Ma'am
In 2 minutes, maximum 5 minutes

337
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,720
Sir, one minute is sir's last shot
- Brother ... brother

338
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,050
Understand the owner's home

339
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,510
What do you mean ...
- Tell me what to say

340
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,930
Pækap

341
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,880
Look at all the lenses

342
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,590
Roll my lot too

343
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,720
Please understand, Magna
I had 20,000

344
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,710
I have to pay two more cameras

345
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,090
I give everyone money as I arrive
Say something like this

346
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,380
That's not so, Mia

347
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Once

348
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,680
Look, your brother is calling for three months
Today, I will give you tomorrow

349
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,710
You can find Bhai's brother

350
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,910
Sister
- why?

351
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,520
Your movie has been postponed

352
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,730
is it?

353
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,900
I do not usually watch short films

354
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,360
I do not want to look or feel

355
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,480
What's on this movie?
After watching the actor

356
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,510
For a moment my heart stopped

357
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,460
It's really like a short film
I did not see it before

358
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,320
As soon as Meganad is seen ..

359
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,700
Put my hands on my pocket

360
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,280
Just as he watched, he walked away

361
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,880
Most felt

362
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,350
Tell the truth that's a comment
Was it you?

363
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,050
Hey, what's he saying?

364
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,860
Once every time he says that
Do not think so

365
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,590
Last week, the Boi Pope said
Now it's called 'three times'

366
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,230
Sajith is yet to be allowed a little bit
You can not believe it

367
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,510
It's your choice

368
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,960
We thought our team would be a source of strength

369
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,280
If you do not, do not

370
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,660
Excuse me, did you have to wait a long time for your brother to wait?
It's okay

371
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,370
You know my brother Colin Shootin
It's very difficult to manage

372
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,740
Would you like to go to the office for further study?

373
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,350
That's what

374
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,550
Are there any orders?
- Definitely

375
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,460
Ā..samāvenna

376
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,490
Brother

377
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,780
Brother

378
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,850
Tell me, ma'am

379
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,920
Vaj Samosa is one
The two bars

380
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,070
Tamp-Up

381
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,130
Bring me brother
Right, ma'am

382
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,470
Oh, forgive me, brother
I do not need anything

383
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,560
That's what that said
I'll get something

384
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,270
No, no, brother.
- Do not ... Alright

385
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,510
No thanks
No, please

386
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,410
Sure?
- I'm sure

387
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,060
All right, take a break

388
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,920
You tell me where you've been me
Which short film I saw

389
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,280
I've been watching your short films

390
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,030
Vaddy Pou Potty Pilla
Crazy love is good

391
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,760
This crazy love of brother of love is not marriages
Love is Love Marriage

392
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
Madness finally comes

393
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,540
Yes. Yes

394
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,710
What's your subject to say?

395
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,940
Love is pure

396
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,220
This is a play is like a family drama

397
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,470
Family drama
- Yes, please

398
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,450
Great

399
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,730
I have many subjects too
Challenging

400
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
Let's try it

401
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,990
Talk to my brother

402
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,920
Now open the screen

403
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,430
Qartik if you do not divorce my daughter

404
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,810
I'm dying

405
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,440
His wife does not like this marriage

406
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,850
My cousin, I like a lot of Rajaz

407
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,360
I like him, Dad
I'm just marrying him

408
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,400
Hey, you want to see Shriy

409
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,920
We need to talk with Sri

410
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,580
Within two days Hyderabad is coming ... coming

411
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,100
Now you go to the girlfriend and leave us
That's the point that needs to be solved

412
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
So

413
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,590
You're doing a short movie
Not that

414
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,180
I am at your company for two days

415
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,040
Love to act like that

416
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,120
No, please trust his dad
If you have a girlfriend

417
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,450
Both agree ... fool

418
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,600
Listen

419
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,720
Hello, who is this scooter?
What did you think was wrong?

420
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,820
Pasha's brother

421
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,520
What's this guy?

422
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,820
You pay the rest of the money
Rent and carry the car

423
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,280
You're biking
If you take it, it's gonna be a big deal, brother

424
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,250
Bike is my identity brother

425
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,270
Please ... Oh, please .... Oh, my brother

426
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,510
Shut up

427
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,370
Do not act, I said a lot

428
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,300
Oh, the only crew of my brother is the last
Give the chance to give the same chance

429
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,740
Surely, I'll give you your money
- Please, brother

430
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,360
Please ... I swear my brother

431
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,610
Can

432
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,190
Take the money after a week

433
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,980
No, it's 3 days

434
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,380
Good three days

435
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,860
Password number

436
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,950
5555

437
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,690
A good number

438
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,410
You need 3000
- What?

439
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,860
Would you please give me permission in 2000?

440
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,980
Let's first pay the money later. Let's see

441
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,110
Do you have 9999 brother?

442
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
Worthless one

443
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,560
What's it coming back?

444
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,580
A friend who told me he's coming

445
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,630
and you?

446
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,480
Another girl is coming to see her

447
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,170
Brother

448
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,390
Brother

449
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,010
What?

450
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,140
I'll do it

451
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,400
Not until now?

452
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,480
I'll do it now, brother

453
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,600
But why do you behave?

454
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,150
It's like a joke till now
He was acting like a villain right away

455
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,110
Did you see anything out there?

456
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,880
Then what else is there?
Is that it?

457
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,790
How much will I say?

458
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,820
Tell me how many you expect

459
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
10.000 million

460
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,190
Right for 10,000 days for two days
20,000, this is sure

461
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,020
No, it's not 10,000 days for both days

462
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,770
This is what is this

463
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,960
Then, we're not in any way wrong

464
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,910
But more than a brother's money is important

465
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,740
So all of your friends
I need information, right?

466
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,300
Aha! .....

467
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,950
Right

468
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,800
Hey, he's been waiting for 15 minutes

469
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:59,840
How much longer to wait?

470
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,480
Karthic, he'll be back for two minutes

471
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,550
Coming to be that girl

472
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,790
What's your name?

473
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,910
Megan

474
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,780
I told you I was working

475
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,730
No, Rohan said they did not come

476
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,050
There's a college project

477
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,610
No, excuse me.
Bye Bye

478
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Hi, I'm Karthik

479
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,220
Hi, I'm a software engineer

480
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,950
Hi uncle

481
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,770
Hi uncle

482
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,690
What are you doing?
I am a software engineer

483
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,520
Sri ..
Hello

484
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,390
What's your problem

485
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,760
I first told your friend
My character is very important

486
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,720
How's your father looking after?
I know, right?

487
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,640
What are you looking for?

488
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,220
Look at this

489
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,380
Sri

490
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,120
I can not believe this

491
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,630
Anyway, get it

492
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,650
Hi uncle

493
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,940
Uncle to bless

494
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Who are you, daughter?

495
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,320
I am Unil Sri Software Engineer

496
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,970
But Karthik told me about it

497
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,590
Excuse me, uncle

498
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,190
Hi uncle

499
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,190
I am Unil Sri Software Engineer

500
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,900
What happened when I got drunk somewhere?

501
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,570
No uncle, I'm fine

502
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,840
Uncle bless it
I am Unil Sri Software Engineer

503
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,610
How about uncle in village
Is everything okay?

504
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,130
Nothing is all normal

505
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,550
Everyone is without problem
They're doing their work

506
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,320
Yes, uncle said exactly
What is this?

507
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,150
What's said 100% is right

508
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,750
Actually, after this Jio Sim
The only people stop talking

509
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,920
Everyone in the Apps Face Face Book is busy

510
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,520
Especially because of these short films uncle

511
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,910
What are the short films?

512
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,110
Sorry

513
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,520
Forgot to uncle
How's Antan?

514
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,790
Aunt

515
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,270
Who was Auntie?

516
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,630
That uncle

517
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,330
How did Karthik's Arthie come in?

518
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,360
Everything's fine

519
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,680
Are you all right, huh?

520
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,240
How are you doing?

521
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,350
Good, man

522
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,400
Software Engineer

523
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,040
Are you Sri lana?

524
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,720
Do you know Shriya beforehand?

525
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,240
I do not know why, little gentleman
Talk every day on the phone

526
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,440
Ok, Dad, we're going to the office
Okay, come in and call

527
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Right

528
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,320
This is our short film
It's working

529
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Shall we?

530
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,630
Sri

531
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,640
Shall we?

532
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,790
to where?

533
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,050
Office

534
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,340
Oh, please forget Carthick

535
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,060
You leave me here today

536
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,160
Right? Bye

537
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,590
How to leave?

538
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,820
Why did she have to leave for this vacation?

539
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,670
Your boss will get angry

540
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,090
Unil it's nothing

541
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,010
You know something, my boss
What am I saying?

542
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,910
Is that so?

543
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,920
Yes, dad

544
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:34,020
Uncle, go and shake your chest
I'll get some good food

545
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,240
Why are you kidding?
I'm there

546
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,480
What a tough guy this is
Where is the mistake of eradicating our work?

547
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,690
After a long time I saw a wonderful character

548
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,850
Because of your shitty short film

549
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,050
My life was 20 minutes dead

550
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,410
No worries, Evvo

551
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,550
Gloomy

552
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,190
Duwa Sri

553
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,060
Getting rid of me

554
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,080
Why is this dilapidated?

555
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,590
Uncle is all in our house
You know I'm cooking food?

556
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Dear

557
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,100
I'm like hell there

558
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,170
Can we go somewhere else?

559
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,720
I understood uncle

560
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,350
That you need to go

561
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,860
Your house is very good ladies

562
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,510
Where are your parents and mother?

563
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,870
We are an uncle mother in the capital
Work in the CMC

564
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,360
What is Dad doing?

565
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,670
Before I understand my life
Dad was unhurt by accident

566
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,400
My dad's been seen only in photographs

567
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:56,510
Do not you think your daughter did it?
Remind your dad and give you a sorrow

568
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,010
Uncle, where is the sadness of reminding parents?

569
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,440
But my mother did not have a father
Trying to get lost

570
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,540
After dad's gone
My mother suffered so much, uncle

571
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,750
Dad's court to get his job done
It's like walking

572
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,390
I did not look at Mother either side of my dad

573
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,750
But me ... I took care of the situation for a while

574
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,190
It's my mom's love for me

575
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,920
Every month, Mother is going through her head
Walking with the beach

576
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
But

577
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,580
If daddy was dying at all
Uncle feels good

578
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,620
Now, if your dad were still alive
 What are you doing?

579
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,640
On my scaffold, I showed the whole city

580
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,780
Two ice cream bars

581
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,730
Uncle, this is good

582
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,910
Aṁkal..aṁkal

583
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,990
That's not right

584
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,660
Carthus and your first time
How I met you wherever

585
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,410
Both do not take the phone

586
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,180
But go ahead and ask your questions
Where I go

587
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,660
Dad is already angry
Now the girl is telling anything else she's coming into the mouth

588
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,020
Sir Sri Nahn used to be the first to use it, Sir

589
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,300
That's why I did not even hear anything

590
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,220
Do I know before from before?

591
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,770
You're in the Sir's phone, Sri
Talk to you

592
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,470
Silly, I'm in the iphone
Only what we say is done

593
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,480
This is not the case

594
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,890
Are you hungry for pissing your brother?

595
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,220
Uncle

596
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,190
She did not call mother in the morning
Scared I'll get a call

597
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,190
Right

598
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Hey

599
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,270
How about a city girl
It was frightening first

600
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,950
After all, the fear was gone

601
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,460
Hey

602
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,440
First of all, this is your uncle
We need to tell you clearly

603
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,210
He's an idiot

604
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,520
That's not it

605
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,930
Where the root of Sri was found

606
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Dad of college

607
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,460
Comes to campus in Sri Lanka

608
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,430
With all that interview I came with All

609
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,740
That was the first time

610
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
is it?

611
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,430
Then why did her daughter say otherwise?

612
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,220
O a time

613
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,000
Early in the morning

614
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,480
Before the house, Colle was alive

615
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,150
Cathtak back in that car
On the way.

616
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,880
Think about it or not

617
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,100
That's all you can not believe

618
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,050
I look around my house
Uncle was a kite ride

619
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,280
What's up for eating?

620
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,990
Why did you come to the bus stand?

621
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,340
Father goes to the village

622
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,970
Because Unil, I'll be in for two days
Karthik said

623
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,340
I know it's for you without knowing
Sorry, sorry, uncle

624
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,680
She did not have anything like that
Karthik did not get away from her mom and did not receive mom's love

625
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,290
From the hostel to learn
Father's love is gone

626
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,170
That love will kill you

627
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,840
There's nothing to see but to see you
I did not think so, daughter

628
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,650
To be honest, your highlights
Your heart is no mute

629
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,350
I like it very much

630
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,590
In one hand

631
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,420
My wife recalled Lakshmi

632
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:21,170
If he had been there, you'd see them
It will be very happy

633
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
She

634
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,900
It's been lucky

635
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,390
Dad

636
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,430
Go and go

637
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,790
Your father is a lot of you
Karthik believes

638
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,860
You do not have to cheat on him

639
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,480
First you get out of the car

640
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,440
Get out of my car

641
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,470
He told me because I wanted to say

642
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,400
Then it's your will

643
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,390
Better give the project a day ago

644
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,080
My father does not get any better, sir
It needs to be done before

645
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,560
Let me

646
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,070
Call Sri patha

647
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,560
Hello

648
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,690
Dad, it's late at night

649
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,820
Fine, son

650
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,270
At 4.00 am, Wijewadha dropped off the bus

651
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,370
By the time I got to the bank, I started to call you

652
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,880
We wait for our village bus
Talking

653
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,000
A mad crazy girl

654
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,670
Asleep while sleeping

655
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,480
But I contacted

656
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,620
Did not you tell?

657
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,550
Dad, I just spoke

658
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,360
Ok my dear.
Right, son

659
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,090
Call Sri Megha

660
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,600
Hello

661
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Are Megana?

662
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,740
The character is included in the role

663
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,210
May I have a phone for Megan?

664
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,110
No, no, no
He does not even phone with his phone

665
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,370
Where is Zuiting?

666
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,990
Loved more than life

667
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,640
After a while, when I go astray

668
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,100
That's all

669
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:33,930
Happily seen the same species
Then they talk about love

670
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
Cheese?

671
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,800
All cheese?

672
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,900
What does the duck say?

673
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,040
All the Koreans you said
A story in a movie

674
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,590
Korean movie?

675
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,540
You are the only person to act.

676
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:53,970
Hey
- Hey

677
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,370
Come here.
What happened, brother? What happened?

678
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,800
Are the background materials coming?
Come on, brother now

679
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,630
You have a brain, great
At night leaving a girl?

680
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,440
If I'm not there, who's responsible?

681
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,680
Do not you know that none of the balls came in there?
Ten miles [10 km] walked

682
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,260
Sorry

683
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,900
Angry

684
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,060
Forget it

685
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,420
I'm sorry, I made a grudge against you

686
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,200
I was joking with me

687
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,200
Why is it here?

688
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,940
I thought that he acted a little bit in the night
You came to ask forgiveness

689
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,080
It's ok. No, it's okay

690
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,620
Come see my friends

691
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,650
The guys are the Karthik

692
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:52,880
Hello ..
- Hi, sir

693
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,280
He is Murugesan, my DOP
- Hi, sir

694
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,700
He cheated you

695
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,570
All he does is play

696
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,210
I know that his acting has given him the money

697
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,850
Mom ... Mom ... grin for something

698
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,340
Hello Harsha
The best actor in our short film

699
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,060
Take it easy

700
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,010
Action

701
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,610
I'm very sorry

702
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,940
I'm really sorry

703
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,640
Even if you're in my line, I'm with you

704
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,710
I did not feel so much loving

705
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,880
You do not know where I'm from anywhere in my life.

706
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,520
From then on

707
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:14,030
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's not so

708
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,550
Brother ... how about the dialogue?
Why the pauses?

709
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,210
It's not good to pause at any time in the dialogue

710
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,460
You need to feel the feelings of the dialogue

711
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,500
You know it with that feeling
You have to play with your eyes

712
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,090
Right?
Say that

713
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:26,840
Eccarayinē?
- Ready?

714
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:29,460
Ready
Let's get another one and get on

715
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,320
Right?

716
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,590
Track 02

717
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,130
Action

718
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,020
I'm very sorry

719
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,270
I'm really sorry

720
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:40,360
Even if you're in my line, I'm with you
I did not feel so much loving

721
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,780
Since the day you came to my life
My life has completely changed

722
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,230
I was blindfolded by your ignorance

723
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,450
I love you

724
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,100
I really love you

725
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,590
The act of acting from the eyes was to open his eyes
Eyes are not reddish

726
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,590
Eyes need to show you feelings

727
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:04,280
But somebody's playing except for him
No one can know that it's a show of action

728
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,380
But you do not like me
We all see bro

729
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:11,340
You need to play Thatcher Songs
How are the kids listening?

730
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,870
Even when we make short movies
The audience sees that like that

731
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,400
With great desire

732
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,650
Let's do another one

733
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,880
Track 03.

734
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,550
Brooction

735
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,430
I'm sorry forgiving

736
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,020
You are so many days

737
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,020
I'm so far away from my face

738
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,340
I did not know if I loved him

739
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:36,730
By any chance

740
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:41,240
When I come to my life, from my life

741
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,570
Completely changed

742
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:49,270
I did not know about your mystery too

743
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:51,190
I love you, I love you

744
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:51,950
Cut

745
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,110
Track 05

746
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,190
Track 17

747
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:54,960
Track 34

748
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,480
Please, you are somehow
I need to get this out

749
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,430
I'm very hard with my life
The best feeling weighed is this

750
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,030
Look here for once

751
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,930
Since then everything has changed completely in my own world

752
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,940
I did not know about your mystery too

753
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:10,410
There is no sense in taste
That's the way it is

754
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,880
I understand your feelings

755
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:17,870
All right, sir

756
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,300
Mom, how are you?

757
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,340
It's not that Karthik's acting is anything

758
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,860
Whenever you are in a situation
As long as it is true

759
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:32,240
Girlfriend of your girlfriend, you love her
If you believe in a girlfriend

760
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,880
And then you will act automatically

761
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,820
Action

762
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,310
I'm very sorry

763
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,530
I'm really sorry

764
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:04,800
So long you are near me, I have you
I could not figure out how much I love you

765
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,290
Since the day you came to my life

766
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,680
Ever since, my life has completely changed

767
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,130
I got into your barefoot, too

768
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:13,790
I love you

769
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,100
I really love you

770
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,120
Pækap

771
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,690
We plan on any projects
It's what Karthik wants to do

772
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,800
That's normal for you, Prabhakar
Is there a problem?

773
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,150
How can you say that is normal?
I'm just asking

774
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,810
Wait ... wait ..
Karthik

775
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,540
Exceeding the previous day

776
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,420
He's gonna be late for this time

777
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,280
Sir, this way

778
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:48,890
This project can not be completed when we think it

779
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,810
Things are three things we need
one

780
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,960
Filing

781
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,470
Checking the process

782
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,660
Completion of the project

783
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,790
Filename is 8 days
The process is 7 days to check the process

784
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,550
The end of the project is 5 days all 20 days

785
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,300
So we finish it before the due date

786
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,220
Hello.
- Hello

787
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:14,390
where are you?
Are you in the office?

788
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,430
I'm bored in college

789
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,130
Get Out? I'm out of the rain
I like going very much

790
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,760
Rain does not rain

791
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,220
Let's go

792
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,250
Where are you going?

793
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:44,330
What did you say is wrong?

794
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,120
How did you do?

795
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,810
I'm hungry long time ago

796
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,400
Come on, let's have a meal

797
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:51,470
I'm not hungry, Dad

798
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,120
Eat some son
No, you're eating

799
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,050
Are you ready to come?
I'm ready for now

800
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,560
It's not that long

801
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,200
You do not know we're coming in there
All of these were pre-arranged

802
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,880
One day Karthik came without saying the same thing

803
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,720
I was sleeping right then

804
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,740
It's on the table with Dad
He told me to divide me

805
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,850
I did not understand what to do with me

806
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,260
From then on

807
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,450
Cooking together for me is a habit

808
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,050
But today I have come too

809
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,870
From tomorrow tomorrow, I will make food for three

810
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,730
Oh, how good you're when you smile

811
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,700
Sorry

812
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,230
It's okay

813
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,180
Hi, I'm safe

814
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,520
Megan

815
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,690
How are you?
Are you a engineer?

816
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:12,120
My cousin told me everything?
Oh, right

817
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,580
Who is Rajesh?

818
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:20,680
Tell the cousin

819
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:23,570
Right

820
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,050
Your brother-in-law asked you to go to Corn

821
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,400
Right

822
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,550
Already on the project on the desktop

823
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,960
You should send it?

824
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,060
Ov..bāyi

825
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,090
What ... What are you doing?

826
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:42,400
Do not worry, chase Mahatayu
In times like these are all of you

827
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,640
Trust your dad and plant it
This is yours

828
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,800
You broke up

829
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,660
Is this your planting?

830
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:54,010
Not now

831
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,270
So why did you come to this?

832
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,730
Dad is here every day

833
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,360
Hello ..
Yes, dad

834
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,820
Right

835
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,700
Daddy's gone home

836
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,880
You go home at the grease house
There's a little work to look at

837
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,670
Do not you think about my safety?

838
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,720
He sent himself alone as if he was looking at it

839
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,830
Come on
- OK, bye

840
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,580
Put her in your house
All right, brother

841
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,070
Hey Qarthy when did you come?
- Yesterday I came

842
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,380
Are you alright?
Yeah well

843
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,990
Coming

844
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,060
Hello
Karthik

845
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,680
Karthik

846
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,900
Mēga ..

847
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,490
All of them
Megan

848
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,060
What happened?

849
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,590
Karthik

850
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:07,020
Where are you going ... Kartik
where are you?

851
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,970
Fear Karthik

852
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,590
Karthik

853
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,910
Come on, brother.
Holy shit

854
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:26,600
Can you take Center?
Come on, brother

855
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:30,490
Do you believe?

856
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,020
Do you believe?

857
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,720
You believed

858
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,910
Okay, let's go

859
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,430
It was not the first time you were
Did not you see which village?

860
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:41,530
 Hayidrābādayiyē

861
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,990
Where did you come from?
Came to the house of Chaplipathi uncle

862
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,720
is it? Hyderabad
What are you doing, Sister?

863
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,500
Engineer is doing brother
With actors with short films

864
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,040
What are you doing?

865
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,490
Learning to drive a battery and drive a battery

866
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,540
Mama needs to watch Sister too

867
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:58,170
A lot of good stuff
He wants parents

868
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,320
Do not worry about anything
You have a good job, wife

869
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,080
Life's Successful Do not think

870
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:26,500
Who are you calling?

871
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,030
Hey, let go, hey

872
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,730
Leave me

873
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:34,770
Karthik

874
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,260
Kartik, they really are
It's troubling Karthik

875
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,070
Atǣrapan

876
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,750
Hey, he's getting up

877
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,020
It's my mother's case

878
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,900
Hey, give me my chance

879
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,290
Kartik Karttyk
What happened?

880
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,670
My chance was taken

881
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:22,440
Do you fool people who believe?

882
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,700
Whoever sees you will believe

883
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,030
Chen, give me the chan

884
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,090
Karthik

885
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:22,380
Because your dad Karthik said
Why is not our home coming?

886
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:25,490
I forgot to ask you, did you?

887
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:34,720
How long after the aha Hii? Karthik

888
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:36,150
Good, good

889
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,670
We're going to our Karatec Americans

890
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:39,970
Hey Congratulations

891
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,220
But is not the situation in America better?

892
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,450
Actually, I'm also starting a company

893
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,710
If you join, your baby will be better too

894
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:48,800
Yeah, right

895
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:51,510
How long do they have to work with?

896
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
It's okay

897
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,330
No I really say

898
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:58,720
How many of your posts when you went to America?
I'll pay more than that

899
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:02,060
My position in the US is company director

900
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:03,920
What
Yes

901
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:05,050
It's not possible

902
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:07,620
It needs a lot of handbills

903
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,870
Some company goes to the mall
Check it out once

904
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,160
These days, many companies are buzzing

905
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:17,250
And your father is like a big man in the village
All of us went and lost our fame

906
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,100
You do not do the same thing for our country

907
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:27,450
Brother

908
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,360
Sorry, brother, do not keep them in mind

909
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:33,690
Hello

910
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:36,510
What?

911
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,360
What was wrong with Sir?

912
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,060
Karthik is this

913
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:51,250
An environmental problem is this
There is no reason to worry

914
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,740
This is a Critical Bug
- What?

915
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,910
I know this for you this the whole day
He said he could not give time

916
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,300
What are these?

917
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,610
I've been watching you these days
Other actions have increased

918
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,580
No, Prabhark, I can handle this
Give me one chance

919
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:06,860
No Karthik

920
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:09,510
An employee does not look good to you

921
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,730
You did not respond to the clients
It's a big deal

922
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,210
Your US promotion in a month
There is a decision to make

923
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:18,080
At this time you will do this
I did not expect any hope

924
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:20,380
Give me one chance, please

925
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:23,050
Ok Karthik

926
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,180
3.00 is your last time

927
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,400
Right

928
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,690
Send to the clients, sir

929
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,540
Hello

930
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:57,630
What happened?

931
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:00,030
It works

932
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:03,170
Thank you, God

933
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,710
Do not let this go Karthik

934
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:04,980
Karthik

935
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:10,620
Karthik

936
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,100
are you OK?

937
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:20,660
No, I'm Magna

938
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,620
I'm not fine

939
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,800
Before you get into my world
A different one in my world

940
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,970
Then I was alone

941
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,990
Then you go to America
I did not go elsewhere

942
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,090
How are these two weeks with you?
I do not understand how I got paid

943
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:46,320
But it's not my life, it's the Mughana

944
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:54,530
This is my life
I designed a small thing

945
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,520
But now that's not the case

946
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,280
I dreamed of dreams

947
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,670
Get out of it every day

948
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,710
to be honest

949
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,950
Without me, you can not have me one day

950
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,030
My life is long past
It's been paid to me

951
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:23,220
It's just the easiest way to stay

952
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:27,570
So now we will not be back

953
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:31,880
Look at the time, I'll tell the truth

954
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,180
Goodbye

955
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:35,890

Sinhala subtitles are downloaded from www.zoom.lk.

957
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:47,330
What about Rs 50?

958
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:49,710
Do you know the 50% cocktail coat at COAT?

959
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,290
And whoever I was supposed to be, I was an U.S. officer

960
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,670
According to the law, we can not place the vehicle here
There are tax houses too

961
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:57,730
This mistake was a mistress
Take it to take off

962
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:00,320
There you are

963
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,410
50 and pay for cashew

964
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:18,040
Why tell your short movie
So off of a lot?

965
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,840
Release it quickly?

966
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:21,900
What are you talking about, Mom?

967
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,450
How can I learn other people?
You ask me to go to college every day

968
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,740
You are very frustrated now

969
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:29,050
All right, tell me

970
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,740
Are you going to the college?

971
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,330
When was Vipaj?

972
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,680
I do not know

973
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,770
That's why it is because that's why it's not heard

974
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:42,270
Love anybody?

975
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,740
How do you know?

976
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:48,430
40 years of experience
- Mom

977
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:52,220
With 45 years of experience
Do not you even know this?

978
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:56,000
Megana always reading
Not talking now

979
01:13:56,530 --> 01:14:00,790
See once for a moment
The man who came came said he could not come

980
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:04,300
Find out that you are not in need

981
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,030
Though there is a thousand, it can be a source of strength

982
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:10,500
It's only for love

983
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,740
Yes, Mum

984
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,820
I loved Kartik

985
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:19,900
I like him very much

986
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:23,740
Tell me I'm falling in love
At the same time, professional goals

987
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,630
He gave an eloquent address to America

988
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:30,710
He does not know what you love

989
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,840
That's why I say so

990
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,380
Look at your heart

991
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,720
I'll take some time to fix it

992
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,880
So now we will not see each other again

993
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,800
Mom

994
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,140
She told me she did not meet him

995
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:52,850
Then what else is it to think about that boy?
Stop it and think it's useless

996
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,740
Focus on a new project

997
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,010
Mom

998
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,950
It's been a long time in Wizag

999
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,120
Always when it's an airplane
Why are you waiting?

1000
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,280
No, my daughter

1001
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,020
That big flight

1002
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:12,990
How the sky is flying
I think from a small age

1003
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,310
The last three months are your work

1004
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,840
Karthik is raining in the last two months

1005
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:26,300
Now it's raining

1006
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,150
They're wasting time now
Find a job

1007
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:30,470
I did not even get married, Karthik

1008
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:31,530
What's wrong with that?

1009
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,070
Getting married

1010
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:37,440
No job, no one gives him a girl
If the Karthik does not exist, it will be more difficult

1011
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,320
In the letter of acceptance, the company
Did something give you a goal?

1012
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:43,460
You can go

1013
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:45,120
It's not Karthy.
Going

1014
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,380
She started again

1015
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:52,800
Make some useful short films
You had time

1016
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:56,020
Do such a big ad
Do not say time?

1017
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,630
Tell me my mood is not good

1018
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,560
This is because your mood is not good
When the ad was advertising, your mood would change

1019
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,890
On the beach we hit the big one

1020
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:08,810
Big Big Officer
Battling for this ad

1021
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,470
Do you run a big bean?

1022
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:14,830
That's why I left

1023
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:27,210
Hello

1024
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:54,350
How is it now

1025
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:57,230
Say something 24 hours later
They say they can

1026
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:06,560
This is a serious situation

1027
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:08,710
Now the disease needs complete rest

1028
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,350
Let's check for 10 days, then Eat
Normally, I can go with my home

1029
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:15,420
Thank you, sir

1030
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:22,570
Sety's mother's saffron
Have a look at her

1031
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:26,510
How are you, dad?

1032
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:27,780
Fine, son

1033
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:30,140
I did not think I could see you again

1034
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:32,260
What is uncle?

1035
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:36,270
You're all here for us
Nothing happens to rest you

1036
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:38,550
Yes, Father, take a break

1037
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,430
Everything changes to normal
Doctor said

1038
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:42,900
Wait for the patients to stop just one

1039
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:46,730
You're too late to go

1040
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:47,380
Right

1041
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:50,410
Take Karthic's daughter home, son

1042
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,040
Megan

1043
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,500
What?

1044
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,890
This week I go to the village to father
We were to think about our case

1045
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:07,800
But this is how it did not happen

1046
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:12,930
So, my father and I recovered a little while
 It's gonna be okay, Sarny

1047
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,700
Or your father's worried
They say that they think

1048
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:16,870
Is not it?

1049
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,140
Yes

1050
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:25,200
Oh, are you ready to make some money?

1051
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:26,570
How many?

1052
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,400
Tell

1053
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,030
Because that's what you're behaving
Obviously

1054
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:31,600
I'm in the usual way

1055
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:35,410
But do not come to meet you
I'm not the kind of girl I am

1056
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:40,100
This year, I'll go to Visigas and go to town
Set up a target job at the office

1057
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:42,850
Bye

1058
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,270
Your uncle came in

1059
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:55,150
I've been terribly worried

1060
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,480
For now, wait for you
 From now on I went

1061
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:01,420
In the presence of our suneetha, she has been confirmed as a wife

1062
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,700
Vijayawada Weddale marriage

1063
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:07,730
If I had a good health condition
I've been doing all the work myself

1064
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:11,710
No, first, think about your health

1065
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,040
We do not have anything to do with the wedding

1066
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:15,630
Hey, hey ... ..

1067
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:18,220
Why is it you say 'son'?

1068
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:21,350
All of you are our people in our home
People do not work well

1069
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,850
They do not feel that way

1070
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:25,280
Do not think so, son

1071
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:28,230
They like you very much

1072
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:31,810
Now you're going to marry
I want to see the kids

1073
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:33,690
Everybody thinks

1074
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,180
You guys have to go to the wedding

1075
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:39,360
I can not do it daddy's office
There are lots of work

1076
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,810
Lotus lotions

1077
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,580
You have to go to this wedding

1078
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,650
There's someone out there in the frame
Walk here

1079
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,070
There's no one here, sir, come here and walk

1080
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:27,810
The director is a fool to walk

1081
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:28,970
Harsha

1082
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:36,840
Hi Bravo

1083
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:38,740
what's up?

1084
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,710
My Demo Movie Shoots Bro

1085
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:43,480
We need a little help, Bro

1086
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:44,320
What is that?

1087
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:47,900
I did not do anything when I called Action
Broo, get this camera out of here

1088
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,970
I did not say I can not act

1089
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:51,700
She knows that just to walk

1090
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:53,500
To walk, that is ...

1091
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:54,710
It's not just that, Broo is simple

1092
01:20:54,730 --> 01:21:00,080
Now our movies are around the cellphone around the actress
One file is played in such a way

1093
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,510
You see me like junior rattis?

1094
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:06,130
No, you're a great actor, Bro
- Bro, no, bro

1095
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:07,410
Not at all

1096
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,140
Ready?

1097
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:16,010
Hold this

1098
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,190
You're not the hero, junior
Artis

1099
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:19,290
Hey

1100
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,820
If it goes down, I will die in my hands

1101
01:21:23,330 --> 01:21:24,330
Action

1102
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,020
Walking

1103
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:37,130
Which company did you not see before?

1104
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:38,070
Isprōṭ

1105
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:40,050
What is Ice Fruit?

1106
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:41,580
Isprōṭ

1107
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,450
Okay, who is your agent, that fat man?

1108
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:47,900
I do not know who Mastan is

1109
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:51,030
Well, where is Shutin?
Tell me your number

1110
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,250
What?

1111
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:02,410
My sister sister, Virayawada, is married

1112
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:05,570
Let's both go for the wedding
Dad's insisting

1113
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,960
I do not have time to go, but I can not stop

1114
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,670
So if you would be free tomorrow?

1115
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:14,350
You know what ...

1116
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,090
Actually, I do not have time

1117
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:18,440
Uncle already said this

1118
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,750
So

1119
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:22,320
I set aside my awesome goal

1120
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,360
I'll just take a break from the college

1121
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:27,030
Where are they scented?

1122
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:28,370
Hello

1123
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:33,620
Hello

1124
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:35,250
Hello, I'm cheating

1125
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:36,710
Shyamal?

1126
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:38,410
The wrong callback
Hello, hello

1127
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:39,870
I'm cheating

1128
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:41,650
Turn around a little

1129
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:47,880
Hello, I'm here
Save my magnitude

1130
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:54,800
Yes, I went in haste

1131
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:58,060
Doctor's Touring Environment
Let's get a call. Thank you

1132
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:00,890
Megan

1133
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:01,990
What's the matter?

1134
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,490
Suddenly, two days off, sir

1135
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:07,320
An adult told me to come with someone

1136
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,600
This is my uncle

1137
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:12,610
Hello, sir. How are you?
- I'm fine

1138
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:13,930
How about you

1139
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,180
I'm fine, sir

1140
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,990
It's a two-day vacation, sir

1141
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,770
A two-day vacation

1142
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,030
Once this file is checked

1143
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,260
You see what your daughter is like

1144
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:33,290
What is this?
What is this?

1145
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,790
Are you so sad?

1146
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:40,560
Seeing this

1147
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,770
I was tired of coming to my eyes

1148
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:44,520
Why?

1149
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,910
Sir, my uncle, I do not know English, sir

1150
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:49,430
It's okay

1151
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,560
It's a two-day vacation, sir
OK OK

1152
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:55,460
This Megan is a great student

1153
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,310
It's wasting time on short movies

1154
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,200
I do not ask them to tell me

1155
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:04,150
So, when you're on your own, you'll also hear
He asked me to come with an adult

1156
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:06,200
Why is this?

1157
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:11,510
You have more of your future
That's a lot of thinking

1158
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:15,880
Someone like that principal
If I had been, I was a colony ...

1159
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,300
Megan

1160
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,810
Is this your uncle?

1161
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:22,960
Yes, sir

1162
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:25,340
Tell

1163
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:29,070
If I were a Principal like that
I could have been a doctor

1164
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,280
Calm down, calm down

1165
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:33,770
Coffee

1166
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,100
Sir, just a minute. Sir

1167
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,110
Megan

1168
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,160
You left a little out

1169
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:48,130
It's okay

1170
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,800
It's a two-day vacation, sir

1171
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,300
A two-day vacation

1172
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:06,530
Are you all right,

1173
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:07,430
Doubts?

1174
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:18,790
What are you waiting for?

1175
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,300
We need a 2-day vacation

1176
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:23,160
Tomorrow is perfect all day long
Why Leave Again

1177
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,660
Holiday

1178
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:30,990
Sorry, rock band

1179
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,230
What?

1180
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:51,580
We have two days there

1181
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:54,010
He knows that it took so few items

1182
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:15,160
Sorry

1183
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:23,590
Hello

1184
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,570
Yes, Rohith

1185
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:28,730
Yes, right?

1186
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:31,780
Greetings to you a big day then

1187
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:35,420
That is, we were in a short film
His work did not go bad

1188
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:38,620
Rohit's film was selected

1189
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,080
Who's Rohit?

1190
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:43,730
I made a short movie with me
That's awesome

1191
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:44,960
I do not know

1192
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,970
I'll talk to Rohit

1193
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,360
OK, bye

1194
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,940
Have you not seen my bundy short story?

1195
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,610
Not seen

1196
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,480
Just why did not the Buahbulley look like that?

1197
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,940
Have you seen one of the short films I made?

1198
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,850
Not seen

1199
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,520

1202
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:13,750
This is my record

1203
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,300
For three months everyone knows each other

1204
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,890
You did not make the only short film I made
I did not see it

1205
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:22,160
Now what is your short one?
Want movies?

1206
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,380
No need

1207
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:45,750
Do not go upstairs, ma'am

1208
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:47,170
Drop to the ground

1209
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:51,500
There's a bunk in there
You can fix it

1210
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:53,980
It's okay for me here

1211
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:55,430

There is only one thing without any connection here
Our hotels are not allowed to stay in a room

1245
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:13,000
Sir, these rooms were booked, sir

1246
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:15,080
Then give the two rooms each other

1247
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:21,540
Why did they say they're gone?

1248
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,920
I do not know how you would say the same thing

1249
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,370
And why do you say that?

1250
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:31,840
I'm your wife to be your village
When you say that everyone in Hyderabad is wrong,

1251
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,730
We have nothing to do with Wijayawada
Are you wrong with the idiot?

Boys look like shorts

1275
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,070

He invited me to open it

1281
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:06,840
Open the shop?

1282
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,430
Where did they go without knowing?
The phone did not take it

1283
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:49,450
If you're in there, who's responsible?

1284
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:53,610
Appo Leaving alone in the nights
The guy you do not know now?

And I'm opening a shop

1286
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:58,420
What's to open a shop?

1287
01:31:58,460 --> 01:31:59,460
Really

1288
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:02,440
What is this?

1289
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:03,680
When Sweet Betel

So you went to open a market when you chew betel?

Have you come to open betel's shop?

01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,280
Do not mind what happened to you?

1293
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,410
I want to tell my dudes to my fans
Do not say anything

1294
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:20,800
And they're not like you

1295
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:23,040
I watch my short films

01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,870
They like me very much

1297
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,680
You are a national level cast

Yes, she is a national level actress now
What's your problem?

1299
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,020
You can not say anything

1300
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:35,730
Reading about acting

1301
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:37,870
What did you say?

1302
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,040
Nothing

1303
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:40,270
Can I play it?

1304
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:43,380
Was that the first time?
Without me, I can not act

1305
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:46,940
Is that right? I'll tell you the right one

1306
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,020
Just say it

1307
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:50,180
You need to prove your past
I do not have a need

1308
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:52,010
Shut up

1309
01:32:58,900 --> 01:32:59,900
Why did you laugh?

1310
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,440
I did not laugh at you

1311
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:05,790
Tell me right

1312
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,010
Tell the speaker

1313
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:08,900
I do not need to get ready
You need to go

1314
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:10,650
Tell the speaker

1315
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,400
Why the dialogue?

1316
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,510
Have your conversational dialogue

1317
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:18,970
Ok, give me a second

1318
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:27,720
If there is another word, please do it

1319
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:29,260
No need

1320
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,820
I'm really sorry

01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:57,770
Not once do you understand?

1325
01:33:57,950 --> 01:34:00,270
How many times do you want me to tell you?
Do not follow me

1326
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:01,470
you idiot

1327
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:04,280
It's your dialogue

1328
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:08,400
Not once do you understand?
How many times?

1329
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:10,490
You do not like me behind me
Do not come up, Modi

1330
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:12,420
Not once do you understand?
How many times?

1331
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:14,810
How many times do you want me to tell you?
Do not follow me

1332
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,490
you idiot

1333
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,600
Not once do you understand?

1334
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:17,900
You and your act

1335
01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:23,150
Sorry

1336
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:24,600
I'm very sorry

1337
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:27,010
What is pardon?
- I'll apologize too

1338
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:01,740
OK, bye

1339
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,280
Mr.

1340
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:17,960
Mr.

1341
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:19,070
Here

1342
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:56,100
Hello ..
- Uh, Karthik

1343
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:58,850
where are you?
Just came home

1344
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,210
I'll be right
- Ok Karthik

1345
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,080
Come on, Mom

1346
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,970
What happened to your workout?

1347
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:09,870
A friend took mine

1348
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:15,990
Tell me right

1349
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:17,780
Because this is all of a sudden in Hyderabad

1350
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:22,680
It was this Wednesday that the temple went there
I met my wife Subramaniam

1351
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:25,470
His son was searching for Nave

1352
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:27,510
Come on, move around without going around

1353
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:28,700
It's the same thing

1354
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:31,880
Subramaniam is thinking of getting you up

1355
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:34,800
I asked you to ask what kind of thought you were about Naveen

1356
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:36,780
Tell me it's big

1357
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:41,040
I said the same thing as a little girl
He's so big for nothing

1358
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:44,270
For me, to do this
He said he liked it very much

1359
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,880
Do you like it?

1360
01:40:45,970 --> 01:40:47,820
Who asked your will

1361
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:50,380
Am i the one you marry
- What's that?

1362
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:51,490
So much sherry?

1363
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:53,680
My daughter does not go beyond what I say

1364
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,090
Even if I say it, he's one more
I told you so much about him

1365
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:59,650
I do not know anything, Mom
I'm not getting married

1366
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:01,670
Tell them when you reach Veysag

1367
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:07,890
Earlier in that raid
I told you not to

1368
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,070
Now you are saying no to this marriage

1369
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:13,380
You do not really hear me
I will not even care

1370
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,090
Do not listen to me

1371
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:19,020
I do not like this marriage

1372
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,040
Who else wants me to say?

1373
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:24,400
No matter what you say, I do not ask
You need to get married

1374
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:27,010
That's what's happening in our satharam temple

1375
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:33,130
Mother first stop crying

1376
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,830
Let's hear what you say

1377
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:37,270
I do not believe you
Swear by my name

1378
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,790
Really, Mom, I'll marry

1379
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:40,910
You swear by me

1380
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:41,930
Our satharam temple

1381
01:41:42,150 --> 01:41:44,520
Okay, our satharam temple

1382
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,090
This is me hello brother
Let's talk about it

1383
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:04,150
Wait a minute. She needs to talk to you
- All right

1384
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:05,220
Here

1385
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:07,490
Hello
Are you alright?

1386
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,990
Are you OK, daughter?
I am OK

1387
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:10,830
To learn?
Yeah, well, he's studying

1388
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,200
All is well uncle

1389
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,030
How's Antan?
- Good daughter

1390
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:16,000
How about Naveen Brother?

1391
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:18,990
Why did Navin brother say?

1392
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,510
He promised me

1393
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:23,830
Took the phone up, Mother

1394
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:27,870
What if you do not do what?
Did you swear alleged by my name?

1395
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:30,550
After swearing falsehood, I swear to believe

1396
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:33,010
No need to swear to tell the truth

1397
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:37,120
Look who Kartik loves you
You do not even know if it will

1398
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:40,700
With him thinking of this
Saying no good connection

1399
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:41,920
Think about it

1400
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:45,570
I know what I love about Kartik. You know
So why bring in this

1401
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:49,020
What does Subramaniam uncle say?

1402
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,350
Tell my brother

1403
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:22,820
Well sir, I'll be there tomorrow morning

1404
01:44:24,010 --> 01:44:26,720
It's been two more days
Mother, why are you so good?

1405
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:29,430
I heard the office investigating

1406
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:30,970
Get in soon and call me

1407
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,040
And then I met Subramaniam
I want to say this too

1408
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:35,380
First do the job

1409
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:37,700
I'll do it

1410
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:40,260
Start by telling Karthik what is in your heart

1411
01:44:40,450 --> 01:44:42,570
When your love is hidden
How do you know that boy?

1412
01:44:57,310 --> 01:44:59,170
This is why you came here?

1413
01:44:59,790 --> 01:45:02,720
How big those planes are
Let's see if you're upstairs

1414
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,340
Can you see?

1415
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:06,340
You're going to Wetseag on a plane

1416
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:09,010
God damn it, on a plane?

1417
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:10,220
I'm not coming
Mom, Mom

1418
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:12,830
I'm scared
Nothing to worry about

1419
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,880
Everyday, hundreds of thousands of people go
Do not be afraid to stay here

1420
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,130
Come on, Mom, come on

1421
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:34,990
Mother's name is Shawatha

1422
01:45:35,010 --> 01:45:36,890
Do not be afraid
It goes to Wexag

1423
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:39,090
Right
- Go with me

1424
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,490
OK ..
It's all Auntie

1425
01:45:40,690 --> 01:45:43,050
Do not worry, I'm there
Thank you, In

1426
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:46,140
All right, will we do, Auntie?

1427
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:49,260
Bye

1428
01:46:00,490 --> 01:46:01,800
How is Basha?

1429
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:03,290
I'm alright?

1430
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:05,410
Your scooter is fine too, dear

1431
01:46:07,210 --> 01:46:08,490
No, brother

1432
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:11,650
I do not own my own store too

1433
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:16,080
All the money is your mother
I have not paid anything

1434
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,740
Your secret has your secret

1435
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:19,260
Get back here

1436
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:57,860
I'm on my way, sir

1437
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:02,700
Hi

1438
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:06,510
He did not even come to see him again ...

1439
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:08,290
I could not come

1440
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:10,170
Call it

1441
01:47:12,410 --> 01:47:13,410
Did not see

1442
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,390
Just go to the house

1443
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,350
I'm going to be late for another job

1444
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:20,540
I do not mind

1445
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:49,810
That's because David's house came

1446
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:51,720
I said I have a job

1447
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:52,880
Right

1448
01:47:57,990 --> 01:47:59,840
Come on, Kartik, come on

1449
01:48:04,090 --> 01:48:06,550
Why did you say that sir?
Is everything ok?

1450
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,440
Information from the Main Office, Karthik

1451
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,360
Promotions in America

1452
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,080
Achilles are sturdy

1453
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:20,110
Excuse me

1454
01:48:24,990 --> 01:48:28,610
I know Karttyk is about this promotion
That you had so many expectations

1455
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:31,630
I did not expect this to happen

1456
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,440
For a long time on this occasion
From here, sir

1457
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:38,870
I know that I know

1458
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,500
You really betrayed it

1459
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:45,950
With your experience with Akil
 It was not easy to push

1460
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:52,540
Okay, sir

1461
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:54,220
I will email you my letter of resignation

1462
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:55,870
Hey Karthik

1463
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:57,660
What's to be harvested?

1464
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:00,430
Yes Sir, I can not work for this company again

1465
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,680
I have an Owl Shop company
The server will come with me

1466
01:49:04,870 --> 01:49:07,280
I did not expect this from you, Karthik

1467
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,770
Anybody from both of you goes to America

1468
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:12,750
The rest of the rest will take responsibility
That's what I believe

1469
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,600
Believe what you said and head it
The office took four projects

1470
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:21,150
Now, if you let me down in the middle, you and me
They will face legal issues

1471
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:26,400
When I get a problem, you too
I do not want to think about problems

1472
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:34,270
Karthik

1473
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:36,200
Give me two days

1474
01:49:36,490 --> 01:49:38,680
One more time Head Office
I'll call

1475
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,520
Why uncle asked to come?

1476
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:55,800
Yes, daughter

1477
01:49:56,030 --> 01:49:57,850
It's important to talk to you

1478
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:01,140
I'm always your mother
But this was to come along with me

1479
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:04,340
My heart stopped him because of him

1480
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:09,720
Now he liked your marriage

1481
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:13,580
Yes, I thought she was trying to get the truth to Karthik

1482
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:16,230
Pete is our girl
Fear how you'll be carefree

1483
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:18,600
But for me, you know me
That fear was lost

1484
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,920
Saraswati ..

1485
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:32,070
Take it

1486
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,850
Today is my sister's daughter

1487
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:37,520
My aunt was to give these to her daughter-in-law

1488
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:39,920
When my sister is alive,

1489
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:43,540
My daughter is my daughter-in-law
This left our home

1490
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,790
My daughter does not enjoy it

1491
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,480
You are like my daughter

1492
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:55,580
Take it?
Do not worry

1493
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:58,500
Someday it will come to you to visit

1494
01:50:58,600 --> 01:50:59,890
Take it

1495
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:21,200
What is this?

1496
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:22,380
This is for your mom

1497
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:24,560
Your grandmother bribed your mother

1498
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,190
After your mother's home
To give in to daughter-in-law

1499
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:28,850
Your uncle gave me

1500
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:30,780
So what is it?

1501
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:33,550
Call me to come here urgently

1502
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:40,070
So what is it?

1503
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:42,450
Do you understand what you are talking about?

1504
01:51:42,650 --> 01:51:45,870
Your father is my siblings
Believe most

1505
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:49,550
It's not just that everyone is this
I believe in truth

1506
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,020
It's a lie because it's the one time

1507
01:51:55,150 --> 01:51:57,370
As of now, this is a deception
Has changed Karthik

1508
01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:01,520
This lie is not available today
Do you understand what to say?

1509
01:52:01,770 --> 01:52:03,560
He'll cut his father's ticket for two days

1510
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,570
I also became American promotion

1511
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,820
And then you're none of my nobody

1512
01:52:10,270 --> 01:52:12,250
Are you anybody I'm from?

1513
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:14,540
Theirs

1514
01:52:15,530 --> 01:52:18,210
He looked after his own brother
David took care of it

1515
01:52:18,670 --> 01:52:19,670
So who am I?

1516
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:21,780
But

1517
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:24,400
I did not think you were so selfish, Karthik

1518
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:27,670
Yes, I am selfish in here
No one is selfish

1519
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:31,480
This is also a big thing

1520
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:33,700
It's been a good one right now

1521
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,770
A few more days
What's going on?

1522
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:37,520
what?

1523
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:39,580
Grade?

1524
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,650
That's what you know

1525
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,220
Turn left to Gemini

1526
01:52:58,780 --> 01:52:59,780
To the right, sir

1527
01:53:01,170 --> 01:53:02,170
Right

1528
01:53:03,970 --> 01:53:05,700
These bills

1529
01:53:06,450 --> 01:53:07,890
This
Okay

1530
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:09,020
Sir.
B

1531
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,760
Sir, let's get your records done

1532
01:53:30,710 --> 01:53:31,710
Sorry

1533
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:35,150
Now you're a girl out there with you
Where did you see that one?

1534
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:36,620
I went to pay the bill

1535
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:38,060
Who are you?

1536
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:39,910
I am Mijaana's principal

1537
01:53:41,210 --> 01:53:42,210
Megan?

1538
01:53:42,670 --> 01:53:46,110
You see the name of the girl you saw with me Sri

1539
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:48,450
Shree?
- Yes

1540
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:51,010
No, that kid's name is Megana

1541
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,210
My student, sir

1542
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:55,960
She is not a student, but a software giant

1543
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:58,430
Is that a child software engineer?

1544
01:53:58,590 --> 01:53:59,590
Mr.

1545
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:02,010
Coffee came with the hot water

1546
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:05,990
Hey, you're staying

1547
01:54:06,690 --> 01:54:08,650
He knows once who I am who I am

1548
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:10,470
This is Meganai's
 My college came

1549
01:54:11,130 --> 01:54:12,590
What does he say?

1550
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:17,010
Sayin 'the idiot really
Are the names of the child, Megan? Shree?

1551
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:20,600
Raise your head up and talk

1552
01:54:23,450 --> 01:54:25,160
Asking you

1553
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:56,150
So we paid the bail

1554
01:54:58,590 --> 01:55:00,210
Talking with the phone

1555
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:03,180
When she needed the medicine, she told him
Kartik comes in 10 minutes

1556
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:06,860
No problem

1557
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:12,730
But he told me to take medicine
Do not forget the doctor

1558
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:17,440
Dear

1559
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:29,590
How many days do you have to play?
I do not know

1560
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:31,640
Take this

1561
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:34,860
Stop playing now

1562
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:38,620
It's my people too

1563
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:40,950
Some in the village cheated me

1564
01:55:41,210 --> 01:55:43,160
You have heard that you are deceived

1565
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:46,270
And I call it deceiving
I did not know what to do

1566
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:49,700
For the first time

1567
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:52,820
What are you talking about?
I found out

1568
01:55:57,620 --> 01:56:00,050
Please, get out of here

1569
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:01,140
Uncle

1570
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:44,290
Mēgā

1571
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:47,060
What else do you think about her?

1572
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:50,940
Our Subramaniam connection
Good relationship

1573
01:58:51,410 --> 01:58:52,740
Think about it

1574
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:57,940
Hello
- Megana

1575
01:58:58,260 --> 01:58:59,680
Kartik goes to America

1576
01:58:59,950 --> 01:59:00,950
let go

1577
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:02,210
That's the purpose

1578
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,130
Why are you talking like that?

1579
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:06,140
And you love him

1580
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:08,200
I did not love anyone

1581
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:10,750
Mom ... I like this

1582
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:16,140
The guy who loves does not have Megan
Trying to go to America ...

1583
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:19,160
Actually, you're a great cousin

1584
02:00:19,810 --> 02:00:21,190
I did not love anyone

1585
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:24,790
Before I come to Gaga
The dream was to America

1586
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,040
I need to accomplish my objectives

1587
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:31,670
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, your dreams
All of the goals are all about you

1588
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:34,700
The guy who's closing in for about five minutes
There is no time for you

1589
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:36,590
Yes. It's important that I go to America

1590
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:37,960
I do not need anybody

1591
02:00:38,430 --> 02:00:40,140
And Megana looks after him

1592
02:00:40,710 --> 02:00:42,160
I do not have time to think about him

1593
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:45,230
And do not even do your grandmother's last steps
You did not have time

1594
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:48,820
So, time to think about Megana
How Can I Think That I Have It?

1595
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:53,440
This is your father for 4 years
Look, it's only six times

1596
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:55,420
You're such a great person

1597
02:00:57,130 --> 02:01:00,060
Kohdeo is not known in America
Because I want to live with people

1598
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,770
Stay with your people
You forgot it

1599
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:06,510
No one else with you
A girl does not spend much time

1600
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:09,640
Because when you are, you are
They know

1601
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:11,870
You're going to leave that way

1602
02:01:17,090 --> 02:01:19,900
A good job in America is a good future

1603
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:21,730
What's more for a girlfriend?

1604
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:24,050
A lot of girls are willing to marry me

1605
02:01:25,130 --> 02:01:27,490
The girls were interested in America

1606
02:01:27,810 --> 02:01:30,200
Not everyone wants to go to America

1607
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:33,540
But what did you say?

1608
02:01:33,890 --> 02:01:35,600
Do you want any girl?

1609
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:40,110
Why is anyone else? Your cousin ...
I did not want to marry you

1610
02:01:42,430 --> 02:01:45,240
Why are you marrying me?
Rajesh loves

1611
02:01:51,170 --> 02:01:53,460
I do not know any Rajesh.

1612
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:57,580
I lied to you

1613
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:06,910
If I marry you, I'll be like you
He was afraid to live

1614
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:13,190
You are mechanically human
I do not know how to live apart

1615
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:41,860
Father ...

1616
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:52,960
Dad

1617
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:56,610
I'm going to America
You like it, do not you?

1618
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:59,440
Why are you asking that?

1619
02:02:59,890 --> 02:03:01,440
Nobody said anything?

1620
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:05,510
No matter what anyone says, I do not care
Dad, I'm important to you

1621
02:03:06,270 --> 02:03:08,160
Tell me you like, do not you?

1622
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:15,750
Really I'm scared, son

1623
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:19,950
Like many parents in the village

1624
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:23,110
From my computer today, from my computer

1625
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:26,300
You give it and I'll see the Pad

1626
02:03:26,890 --> 02:03:27,890
But...

1627
02:03:28,170 --> 02:03:31,730
A lot if you're in America
Happy birthday

1628
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:33,740
I did not say no, boy

1629
02:03:41,170 --> 02:03:43,170
Dad

1630
02:03:43,650 --> 02:03:46,640
From the age of your choice, you say no to me
The hostel

1631
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:51,070
It's a world other than learning
Not being aware of ...

1632
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:57,690
Every day, the whole 24 hours are targeted
Tired of the projects

1633
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:00,170
She's going to America now

1634
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:02,980
Did you think it was for my happiness, Dad?

1635
02:04:04,190 --> 02:04:05,690
No, Dad

1636
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:08,520
Because you need to be happy

1637
02:04:12,460 --> 02:04:14,820
I noticed your face when I was a child

1638
02:04:20,190 --> 02:04:21,640
It's sweet to see this again, Dad

1639
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:34,500
Tell me the truth, dad ...

1640
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,780
You're just laughing with your heart

1641
02:04:37,070 --> 02:04:39,760
How long does it take to sleep in comfort?

1642
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:48,350
I've always gone to that cornfield

1643
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:51,410
How are you?

1644
02:04:56,200 --> 02:04:58,310
Earn money and earn dad ..

1645
02:04:59,270 --> 02:05:01,770
Now, finally, to the United States

1646
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:04,840
Some months later
That land is back, Dad

1647
02:05:05,260 --> 02:05:06,820
Years ago

1648
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:09,380
Money is your face laughing at your face

1649
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:12,390
All
I do not need anything else unless it's my dad

1650
02:05:12,950 --> 02:05:13,950
Nothing

1651
02:05:15,890 --> 02:05:16,890
Hey

1652
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:20,880
What is this?

1653
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:22,600
B

1654
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:31,490
When I see my grief, you will ruin it
Would you be happy to see me?

1655
02:05:32,450 --> 02:05:35,340
Is it sad to understand it?

1656
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:37,810
I do not know, son

1657
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:42,030
What you said is true, son

1658
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:46,130
I smiled whole-heartedly for years

1659
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:47,840
What do you know?

1660
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,860
This money was the only thing worth more than the property

1661
02:05:53,090 --> 02:05:54,820
My property

1662
02:06:02,330 --> 02:06:03,690
It's your mother

1663
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:16,430
We go to our corn everyday

1664
02:06:16,610 --> 02:06:18,660
It's not what I want them to do

1665
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:21,360
That's it

1666
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:24,190
With your mother

1667
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:27,140
Remember the memories

1668
02:06:32,780 --> 02:06:34,240
You're crying

1669
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:38,570
After the loss of my mom, another marriage
Why not?

1670
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:43,630
My Laxmi's place is someone else

1671
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:50,930
My smile is happy too

1672
02:06:58,860 --> 02:06:59,860
Hey

1673
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:04,570
Now I'm the only one left for you

1674
02:07:07,420 --> 02:07:10,040
If I feel sad

1675
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:13,540
Soon, a ticket is taken and Hyderabad is coming

1676
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:17,080
Now

1677
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:19,310
If you're away

1678
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:28,630
It's been so long gone

1679
02:07:29,190 --> 02:07:31,440
Unbearable anger

1680
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:36,790
You've lost your property for so long
As a father, I saw him

1681
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:42,140
A wife is lost as a father
Look, Dad

1682
02:07:45,510 --> 02:07:48,270
It's been so lovely for you that love

1683
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:50,520
You are already

1684
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:53,830
He was distant from you

1685
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:58,100
I'm sorry, Dad

1686
02:07:59,490 --> 02:08:01,460
I'm sorry, Dad
Karthik

1687
02:08:01,970 --> 02:08:04,150
Apologize for what?

1688
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:08,790
You like to put your dad in a laugh

1689
02:08:09,450 --> 02:08:11,590
Much less

1690
02:08:18,430 --> 02:08:21,780
Somebody would like someone to enjoy our lives

1691
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:25,710
If they do, they will be left
Just remember

1692
02:08:27,050 --> 02:08:29,860
I wanted your mother's memories, though

1693
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:34,940
Why Memega's memories?

1694
02:08:40,350 --> 02:08:41,350
Son

1695
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:45,280
For Sight, lie
Will not I be truthful for myself?

1696
02:08:48,630 --> 02:08:51,040
I need to make it real dad

1697
02:08:51,970 --> 02:08:54,160
But he marries someone else

1698
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:57,850
How is that little girl in that bunny /

1699
02:08:58,670 --> 02:09:01,970
We all blush in his sorrow
Would you marry someone else?

1700
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:05,060
Where are you?

1701
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:19,460
Do not pick up the phone

1702
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:27,380
What you said is true mom

1703
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:29,780
I did not want you unnecessary

1704
02:09:31,310 --> 02:09:33,300
I did not ask your story

1705
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:44,250
Hello, I'm playing movies today
Are there shutting?

1706
02:09:44,730 --> 02:09:48,030
Who's filming the movie?
 Shootin's announcement

1707
02:09:48,110 --> 02:09:49,110
Holy shit

1708
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,470
Cut the phone

1709
02:10:38,010 --> 02:10:39,010
best wishes

1710
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:42,450
You're going to America. Good luck

1711
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:49,390
Hi, sir

1712
02:10:51,030 --> 02:10:52,080
I'm not going to America

1713
02:10:52,710 --> 02:10:55,750
I gave you a lot of sadness, sir
I'm really sorry, sir

1714
02:10:59,570 --> 02:11:00,570
Why cry?

1715
02:11:00,740 --> 02:11:02,050
Your marriage

1716
02:11:02,410 --> 02:11:03,410
That's why

1717
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:05,450
Tears come to your eyes without knowing

1718
02:11:09,670 --> 02:11:13,540
But to plan everything in life
I never thought of love

1719
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:16,180
Now

1720
02:11:17,190 --> 02:11:19,260
Karthik is not even thinking about it

1721
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:21,880
You better go to the front

1722
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:26,420
Holy shit

1723
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:31,050
Hello, I'm talking

1724
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:34,020
I told you that there is Shutin on Film City

1725
02:11:34,210 --> 02:11:36,890
If you do, I'll wait for you for this

1726
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:39,920
Thank you Shyamala lady waiting for me

1727
02:11:41,490 --> 02:11:43,580
I'll come to the shutin with you

1728
02:11:44,130 --> 02:11:45,800
Am I supposed to be alone alone?

1729
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:48,660
Alright, come on

1730
02:11:50,170 --> 02:11:51,530
Bye Karthik

1731
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,760
Now you know how to talk like this

1732
02:12:09,530 --> 02:12:11,050
But let me tell you

1733
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:15,540
I'm very sorry

1734
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:17,440
I'm really sorry

1735
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:21,240
I have such a day from my side

1736
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:24,410
You could not understand that you love so much

1737
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:29,600
Where did he come from my life?
I completely changed my life

1738
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:33,410
I was also caught in your aesthetic without knowing me

1739
02:12:35,550 --> 02:12:36,550
I love you

1740
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:37,640
I really love you

1741
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:42,020
No Karthik. You can not still act

1742
02:12:42,890 --> 02:12:44,110
This is not a show

1743
02:12:44,690 --> 02:12:46,280
That's what I say

1744
02:12:46,510 --> 02:12:48,170
This is not acting

1745
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:01,020
Did not you know a student?
Get out

1746
02:13:01,150 --> 02:13:03,140
Hey, come here and write it

1747
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:05,390
Is this a shotin?

1748
02:13:10,150 --> 02:13:13,310
Who are you in my first embrace of my daughter?

1749
02:13:14,090 --> 02:13:16,490
Mother said Karthik

1750
02:13:17,650 --> 02:13:21,060
But he likes Subramanium's contact
What did you say now?

1751
02:13:21,550 --> 02:13:23,210
Tell Naveen your brother Mum

1752

1753
02:13:27,590 --> 02:13:30,690

1754
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:32,560

1755

You did not need unnecessary things

1770
02:14:16,330 --> 02:14:20,040
If you said what you said in my heart
My marriage is going first
