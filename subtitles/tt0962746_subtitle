00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,459
You'll not stop till next
show begins, don't you?

8
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,271
Why should you take the
challenge for my sake?

9
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:17,301
l will accept the challenge.

10
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,236
No. Your wounds haven't healed yet.

The bell...

13
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,357
l told you not to keep awake
till the night show ends.

14
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,497
You're not God fearing.

15
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,431
You're awake till the show is on.

16
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,936
Once the show is over, you fall asleep.

17
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,369
Faster...

18
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,292
Oh no! You scared me...!

19
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,165
lf one Seetharamaraju dies,
millions will be born after me.

20
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,034
Every one will revolt against British
and send them packing out.

21
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,902
Seetharamaraju is not just a man,

22
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,045

23
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,236

Go on. Shoot me.
Long live lndia.

31
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,937
You either watch film in the theatre
or meddle with the film rolls.

32
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:26,969
Won't you to study?

33

36
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,770
Foing good things is really good.

37
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,911
But don't chase heroines
like film heroes do.

38
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,348
lf they are beautiful, l will.
-You brat!

39
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,285
You always want me to hike your salary.

40

What great job are you doing?

41
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,352
You wind the reels & switch on
the projector. That's all.

42
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,291
My son is growing up.

43
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,794
The expenses are shooting up.
l need to give him good education.

44

Will he study now and look afteryou?

45
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,531
Go & play the movie. Come in.

46
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,399
Work if you want to.
But l won't hike your salary.

47
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,176
Betterto be a lorry cleaner
than own a theatre.

48
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,315
Who threw these marbles?

49
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,813
Bobbili Puli''.

50
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,683

Please keep quiet.

53
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,625
Where is your son?

54
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,953
He went to get the film print.

55
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:02,786
Where is he?

56
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,122
This is not an ordinary issue.

57
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,628
lt involves public.

58
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,300

59
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,968
He went to the station early morning.

60
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,136
The train might be late.

61
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,567
The train might be late or he must
be chatting with someone.

62
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:14,637
Who knows!

63
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,072

00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,337
l will dismiss you.
lt is up to you now.

65
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,156
He got us arrested by police
for illicit brewing.

66
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,799

Husband won't send me

And parents won't send me
before marriage.

Jyothi, a 2nd year student was
shot dead on the road.

139

40 minutes before the murder,

140
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:22,966
Jyothi's friends say she and
Home Minister's Vicky had a tiff in a party.

141
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,796
They accuse him of this murder.

142
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:31,374
Students state wide are protesting
against Home Minister & his son.

143
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,874
Good.

144
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:37,208
Police say Home Minister's son
isn't involved in it.

145
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:42,979
But students are sure to
bring him to court.

Who is Home Minister? You or me?

153
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,803
You're just a FGP.
Be in your limits.

154
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,064
What? Students?

155
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:06,470
Students do agitate & protest.
You keep quiet.

156
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,303
Hang the phone.

Are they Naxalites?

159
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,078
Will they blow us up?
- They are much worse.

160
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:16,754

A small doubt sir.

169
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,443
Why is Home Minister & his son
always with shaven heads?

170
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,053
Home Minister was with shaven
head on his first night.

171
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,586
That's why.

172
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,591
What is your son doing?

173
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,228

What should l tell him?

178
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,430
Tell him that your nephew
is free at home.

179
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,403
Tell him to give him a post
so that he can mint money.

180
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,133
Shut up. Get up.

181

Call your brother-in-law.
- Brother-in-law...- Go.

183
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,810
Brother-in-law...

184
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,715
Brother-in-law...

185

Why do you disturb my morning sleep?

189
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,062

190
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:45,368
My son, tell us about the girl Jyothi.

191
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,239
l lost a bet because of her.
So, l kissed her in public.

192
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,848
She beat me with slipper.
l got angry. So l raped her.

193
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,281
For my safety, l shot her dead.

194
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,284

Your son will come out from
this case as a free man.

202

l swear on this money.

203
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,370
As prosecution failed to
produce evidence & witness,

accused Vikram alias Vicky

205

00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,979
Finish the job.
And don't quarrel with anyone.

211
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,084
Temple authorities will question me.

212
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:04,983

229
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,114

You licked the sweet pongal
with the plantain leaf.

00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,469
You devoured 10 Vadas with pickles.
-Were you counting?

257
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,234
What did you leave for me?
Plain curd rice.

258
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,139
Okay, give me betel leaf.

259
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,642

Come.

304
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:37,344
Are they gone?

00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,778
Kakinada and Rajahmundry are nearby,

00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,610
how will you reach there
hoodwinking the goons?

317
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:13,610
They will wait in bus & railway stations,

318
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,950
Then how?

00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,130
That's what infuriates me.

325
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,066

Fon't get scared seeing River Godavari.

After reaching Rajahmundry,

352
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:12,732
Your left eye.

353
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,405
Even then no use,
what's destined will happen.

354
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:17,900
So LlC is there foryou.

355
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,402
Take a policy.

356
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,743
Get a policy from this unlucky man.

357
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,916
Why are you smoking here?

358
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,244
He's illiterate,
how can he know?

359
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,750
l've also studied.

360
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:33,082
What have you studied?
Read Bharatham?- No.

361
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,089
A quarter life is waste.
Read Ramayanam?- No.

362
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,420
Half life is gone waste.

363
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,093
Read Bhagavatham?
- Never heard about it.

364
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,095
Three fourths of life is waste.

365
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,097
You asked me so many questions.

366
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,269
Can l ask you a question?

Fo you know to swim?
- No. Why?

368
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,601
Your entire life is waste.

369
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,944
What's this silly logic?

370
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:56,212
The boat may stop, it may drown,

371
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,780
or get washed away in flash floods.

372
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,953
That's LlC is there to insure your life.

373
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,957
You don't move...don't move...

374

Why are you beating him?
-You're the reason for all this.

376
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,637
Are you talking about my death?
Where is this man?

377
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:33,651
Why are you staring at me?

378
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,148

My time is running bad.
- Running bad time?

396
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,559
Who should say whether his
time is good or bad?- My Guru.

397
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,731
Why don't you tell him?
Bloody free loader!

lf not you, will this buffalo fall in love?

401
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,241
Love is justified and it's rule.

402

the girl you love?

He'll give way to you.

O mischievous boat...

431
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,874
Have you crossed the
lines of decency?

432
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,141
Swinging on the waves...

Half good man and half bad man.

00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,661
Why did you do like this? Why?

483
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:53,097
You gave everything to this girl,

Talk to me directly,

Ant...didn't l tell you about it?

489
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:13,449

491
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:30,799

Scared...l'll see if you come out.

You made a scene for ant bite,

00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:11,348
Let them bite,

Aren't they?
Leeches will save you from goons.

l was mad so l did all this.
Would your boy friend do all this?

504
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,419
l wouldn't face all this if
my boy friend had been here.

505
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:29,028
Who found this boy friend?

506
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,700
Hey! Your boy friend is flying away.

Just a wink can make the
mightiest of men to fall flat.

517
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,245
Still how far?

518

This side is bus station, Railway station is
that side, take any route you want.

525
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:43,606
We won't go by bus, we always

00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:51,272
Fire!

527

Bloody! You ask me to get out
and then get scared.

576

You call me as half good
and half bad man,

00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,456

Eat. Sathya.

582

She's totally mad not just half.

583
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:13,266
A boy liked your sister,
but he asked dowry.

Have water!

-What's your problem, Sathya?

588
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:42,891
Anyone will share joy but
only few share your sorrow.

589
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:48,795
l came forward to help you
on my own, so l'm cheap,

590
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,870
it's a trait of rich people.

00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,476
We are not rich people.
-What's this new twist?

592
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,879
There are many such twists in my life.

She still doesn't know
how to wear a sari.

Take care of your dress baby,

602
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:08,374
What might be the reason for her

How do l know?
My youth seems unstoppable...

Have the horoscopes matched...

Has time forthe union dawned?

621

01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,347
They are coming here.

704
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:47,083
They will kill us.

705
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,984
What happened to you?

706
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,033
One shot and gang of
robbers are finished.

707
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,012
What are they? They keep coming.

708
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,413
l don't have marbles, run for cover...

709
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:55,481
They will be here only,
find them.

710
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,921
What?
-What's happening?

711
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,697
They are up there, water below,
we are hanging between.

712
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,268
l feel something's going
to happen now.

713
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,228
lt's happening to me already.

714
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,772
What's happening to you?

715
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:17,962
You're holding the branch, right?

716
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,608
You're holding me, right?
- So what?

717
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:25,009
How can you know the pain of a man
when a girl like you holds him?

718
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:37,551
Boss, they are not here.
-Are you mad? Trying to scare me. Come.

719
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:40,613
What are you saying?

720
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:42,183
They both went to
Antarvedi together, right?

721
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,755
You've come alone, where is he?

722
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:45,788
He went on a boat tour
to river Godavari.

723
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,462
He promised to come back.
- Lies...

724
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,462
he went with the jeans clad girl
he met in the temple festival.

725
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:54,468
No uncle, he went with her
to help her. That's all.

726
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,502
He's Lord Krishna to help women.

727
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:04,304
l expected this mischief from him.

728
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:06,640
l did expect he'll get
beaten up by someone.

729
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:09,874
The show has just begun,
there's lot more to come.

730
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:14,055
Madam...l beg you...
l'll fall at yourfeet.

731
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,191
Lying to me.
- Please tell her, sir.

732
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,393
Sir, she's coming...
she'll beat me...

733
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:20,686
Bloody bastard!

734
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:24,860
You want me to believe a boy
blew up 10 jeeps just like that.

735
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,500
Moreover it seems he
did it with marbles.

736
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:29,703
You must believe that also,
beat them black & blue.

737
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:33,702
Why are you getting beaten up man?
Go...go...

738
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:41,777
Expecting this, l sent ACP
who is like my henchman.

739
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:45,052
He may be coming back with the girl.

740
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:51,716
Where are the police?

741
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:58,029
Tolly 2 Bolly
