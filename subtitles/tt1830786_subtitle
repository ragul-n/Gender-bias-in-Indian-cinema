This is Anthony's car.
No one is going to touch it.

Okay.

39
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:07,472
Brother, careful with the bag.

40
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,747
Mary, this is Anthony's cash and..

41
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:11,875

No. No. What are you doing?

48
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:37,905
Sports bring people together.

Chill. Enjoy the game.

50
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:40,403
Explain that to his Chelsea guy.

51
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,572

1 5x3=45.

60
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,961
That means when a
German player kicks..

angle in the 1 5 minutes..

Yes. But where did it go?

74
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:52,215
Where did it go?

75
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:55,413
Hey! Shut the gate. No one leaves.

76
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,313
Shut the gate.

Cheeckk everrynone.

80
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,955
So sad. What do
people get by stealing?

81
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:06,821
Fore cash. What else?

82
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,891
There were a whole 30 in that.

83
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,663
Only for 30,000 or 50,000.

Rs.3 million. There

A whole 3 million.

86
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:16,370
That rascal has made
off with Anthony's money.

87
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,342
l will not spare him.

88
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:21,873
Rs.3 million.

89
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:33,224
Brother, let us

90
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:34,282

Mama!

98
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:29,236
Now what do l do of you?

99
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:31,743
The car and money both
got stolen on the same day.

100
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:33,608
Sorry, mama.
- Whose son are you?

101
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,409
Whose son are you?

102
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:36,607

103
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,174
Right. And who am l?

104
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:40,711
Rosy Gonzalvez.

105
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:45,520
Yes. The Rosy Gonzalvez
at whom a boy had winked..

106
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,525
..when she was 1 5 years old.

107
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,686

That is him. Your father.

Never, mama.
- We'll go? - Never, mama.

118
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,660
Just as every girl enters
movies once she becomes Ms. lndia.

119
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:28,660
Similarly, every car goes to
Usmaan's garage after it is stolen.

120
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:34,871
Usmaan.

121

00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:44,882
What will he pick?

124
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:47,684

You've stolen it from
the showroom, right?

128
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,820
Mind blowing.

00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:59,956

get 'Gateway of lndia' for me.

130

Where will l find him?
- America found Laden.

177
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:16,734
But you'll not find Chetan.

178
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:18,201
He's like the fragrance.

179
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,705
He keeps flying all the time.
America, London, Bangkok. May l leave?

180
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:23,402
Take me out or l'll die.

181
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,816
Chetan. Chetan Chauhan.

182
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,353
Bhagat Bhosle.

183
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:44,394
Here's my card.

184
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:49,629
Are you going to Bangkok?

185
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:52,527
No. l'll get down at
Bandra station on the way.

186
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,872
Pal, since this plane
is bound for Bangkok..

187
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,431
..l'll obviously go to Bangkok.

188
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:58,840
What's your business?

189
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,677
l break rocks.

190
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:04,238
Rocks? Did you serve a term in jail?

191
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:06,885
Low thinking.

192
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:08,420
l have a business of diamonds.

193
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:10,516
Seems to be a huge business.

194
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,750
That's my part time business.

195
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:13,958
Well, l have oil wells world wide.

196
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:15,687
Oil is well.

197
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:21,297

198
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,735

201
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,673
Jet airways.

202
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:33,803
No. No. Not airways.

203
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:34,903
My private jet.

204
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:36,642
But l had to lend it to Modi today.

205
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,781

207
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:46,424
My God! What a watch!

208
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:47,720
lt must be quite expensive.

209
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:51,889
2.5 million.
My taste is kind of high-fi.

210
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:53,226
The watch should be of Rado.

211
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,323
The car should be Prado.

212
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,698
And the serial should be
'Na Aana ls Desh Mein Laado'.

213
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:01,772
By the way, where

00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:42,607
'You kept a watch on my purse.'

236
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:44,643
'And l kept a watch on your watch.'

237
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:51,382

00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,315
'And l stole your money.'

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,390
'Without cash. How are
you doing to have fun?'

240
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:06,927
Hey! Hey! Mr. Chetan.

241
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:13,770
What nonsense!

242
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,966
You are saying that
Bhagat is already in my room.

243
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:17,266
Yes, sir.

244
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,368

00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:21,578
How can Bhagat come?

246
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,444
Tomorrow anybody
will say, ''l am Bhagat.''

247
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:25,416
You can also say that you are Bhagat.

248
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:28,476
Yes. l am also Bhagat. Bhagat
Bolabhai Chauhan from Uganda.

249
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,613
People call me BBC affectionately.

00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,179
That's not my point.

251
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,925

My passport.. got

What is the guarantee
that you are Bhagat?

256
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,333
Do you know any influential man here?

257

00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:09,157
No. He is not Bhagat. l am Bhagat.

266

Two Bhagats.

00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:12,655
You will have to pay extra.

268
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:14,358
He is an imposter Bhagat.

269
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,832

'Dilwale Dulhaniya'..

He is the real Bhagat.

278
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:36,449
You!

Who is this rogue? What does he want?

282
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:43,886
Throw him out.
- There is some confusion.

283
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:46,454
He is saying he is Bhagat.

284
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,289
He is saying he is Bhagat.

285
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,398
Tomorrow you will say
that you are Bhagat.

286

One moment.

When a person's time is bad,
no matter how safe he is..

299
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:17,753
..trouble befalls on him.

Do you know, Khushi?

491
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:48,691
l had also saved money so
that l can stay in such a hotel.

492
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,455
But some fool seized it.

Mr. Bhagat. Mr. Bhagat. Carefully.

494
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,422
Carreffullyn. Mre. Bhagat carreffullyn.

Are there such
people too in the world?

496
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:58,964
They seize money from a blind man.

497
00:30:59,037 --> 00:30:59,969
Very bad.

498
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:00,966
Mr. Bhagat.
- Yes.

499
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:02,240
Shall l ask you something?

500
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:06,671
Don't you have any kin or

501
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,646
l have one. A maid.

502
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:11,545
She washes vessels in
the morning and evening.

503
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,516
My house gets cleaned automatically.

504
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:16,748
No. No. l mean,
a wife or a girlfriend.

505
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:18,152
Or..

506
00:31:21,393 --> 00:31:24,920
There was one. Like you.

507
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:26,429
Very beautiful.

508
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:28,931
l could see at that time.

509
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:33,635
Meenu and l loved each other a lot.

510
00:31:34,706 --> 00:31:35,968
She was model.

511
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,838
And l was a role model.

512
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,902
A solider who could lay
down his life for his country.

513
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:43,447
Soldier?
- So you were in the army.

514
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:48,885
When you were enjoying
your life, l was in the army.

515
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:50,421
l was in the navy.

516
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:51,887
Actually, do you know, Khushi?

517
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:53,754
My friend was also a watchman..

518
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:55,520
..guarding the gate of Navy Nagar.

519
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:56,959
Not gate.

520
00:31:57,028 --> 00:31:59,997
My duty was from
Gateway of lndia to Goa.

521
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:03,324
One day suddenly some
terrorists attacked us.

522
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:05,962
The battle went on for
three days. For three days.

523
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:07,761
And you lost your eyesight.

524
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,966
You are in a hurry to make me blind.

525
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:11,708
Sorry. Sorry. Continue. Continue.

526
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,735
After six months, when l was
discharged from the hospital..

527
00:32:15,814 --> 00:32:17,839
..l went running to Meenu..

528
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,884
Meenu must have been
so excited to see you..

529
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:22,181
..that she must have
hugged you. Right?

530
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:24,449
50% right.

531
00:32:25,257 --> 00:32:26,622
50% ?

532
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:30,689
She hugged someone. But not me.

533
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:34,661
She was hugging somebody else.

534
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:35,955
Oh, God.

535
00:32:36,268 --> 00:32:38,634
Liar. Cheater.
- Control. Control.

536
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,227
What are you saying?

537
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:42,796
No. Not him. l am telling God.

538
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:45,809
You are a liar. A cheater.

539
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:49,679
Why did You do this with such a man?

540
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:53,440
But Mr. Bhagat, you
never got yourself treated?

541
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,483
l lost my eyesight because of love.

542
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:00,186
l will regain my
eyesight because of love.

543
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:03,260
Now that you have come..

544
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:06,564
..love must also be on the way.

545
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,391
Khushi.
- Yes.

546
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:12,800
Will you escort me to the bedroom?

547
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:14,805
Yes. Surely. Come. -Let's go.

548
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:16,835
Okay. Thank you.

549
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:24,846
What a story he has fabricated!

550
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:28,943
Hearing him, Sanjay Leela
Bhansali will make Black part 2.

551
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,627
Who is it?

552
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:43,493
How did you become blind, Bhagu?

553
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:45,627
How did you lose your
eyesight suddenly, Bhagu?

554
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,167
Your eyesight got restored.

555
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:56,912
l lose my eyesight
and regain it at will.

556
00:33:57,282 --> 00:33:58,772
Such a nice system.

557
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:01,516
But henceforth you will be my eyes.

558
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:02,575
What?

559
00:34:02,654 --> 00:34:05,384
Whatever is going on between
Khushi and Chetan.. - Yes.

560
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:06,651
You will directly inform me.

561
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:10,750
You get money for
answering questions in KBC.

562
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:12,456
What will l get?

563
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:14,825
One 'Pawli'.

564
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:16,924
'Pawli' is the
currency of which country?

565
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,331
25%, you idiot.

566
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,631
This partnership has
made my ears sharper.

567
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,700
l can hear Chetan's
voice from far away.

568
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:34,410
''O gorgeous, you are the most
beautiful woman in the world.''

569
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:41,652
''O gorgeous, you are the most
beautiful woman in the world.''

570
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,862
''O cruel, your shirt
is very heartless.''

571
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:49,798
''lt's smoldering slowly.''

572
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:51,802
''lt flutters in the breeze.''

573
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,667
''lt's very shameless.''

574
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:57,333
''lt's slowly becoming wayward.''

575
00:34:57,409 --> 00:35:00,435
''Your glance wins the heart.''

576
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:04,542
''l am waiting. Show me the panorama.''

577
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:08,252
''You hide your charms.''

578
00:35:08,653 --> 00:35:12,180
''Now, don't make
excuses after revealing it.''

579
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:16,290
''Remove the veil.''

580
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:19,888
''Drop the veil.''

581
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:23,861
''Remove the veil.''

582
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:27,530
''Drop the veil.''

583
00:35:28,273 --> 00:35:34,837
''O gorgeous, you are the most
beautiful woman in the world.''

584
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:36,407
''Drop it down.''

585
00:35:37,248 --> 00:35:38,476
''Drop it down.''

586
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,917
''Work it.''

587
00:35:40,218 --> 00:35:42,709
''Wanna see you hit the ground.''

588
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:44,254
''Drop it down.''

589
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:46,553
''Drop it down.''

590
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:47,716
''Work it.''

591
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,283
''Wanna see you hit the ground.''

592
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,730
''Neither scarf.''

593
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:54,594
''Nor veil.''

594
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:57,897
''Nor handkerchief.''

595
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:06,175
''There is no other
wonder in your creation.''

596
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:10,512
''Silky thread's seems like a wall.''

597
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:14,450
''l am waiting for the
chasm to be bridged.''

598
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:21,425
''O gorgeous, you are the most
beautiful woman in the world.''

599
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:24,860
''You hide your charms.''

600
00:36:25,463 --> 00:36:28,921
''Now, don't make
excuses after revealing it.''

601
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:32,897

''Drop the veil.''

605
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:04,367
''There should be
someone who loves me.''

606
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:09,707
''There should be someone from
whom l don't want to go away.''

607
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:13,705
''This veil is not required.''

608
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:15,609
''Now, there is no shame or coyness.''

609
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,204
''There is no distance.''

610
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:18,909
''Forget deecencyn.''

611
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:22,880

''Wanna see you hit the ground.''

623

Mr. Chetan, you do a lot of
social work for poor people.

624
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:55,217
l am so impressed.

625
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:57,447
How much donation do you want?

626
00:37:57,522 --> 00:38:00,491
Ms. Khushi, there is a shortage of..

627
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:02,692
..only 200 million for
Somalia's orphan children.

628
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,523
What's the cost of the project?

629
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:05,893
200 million.

630
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:08,558
200..200 million.
- Listen to me.

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,400
Donate only if you are convinced.

632
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:12,959
This is the art of giving.

633
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:15,465
l am convinced.

634
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,905

Where are you?

638
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,910
Khushi.

639
00:38:27,218 --> 00:38:28,913
The cheque got bounced even
before it could be issued.

640
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:33,583
Khushi, Bhagu is drowning in the sea.

641
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:34,750
Do something.

642
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:35,918
He is drowning.

Listen to me.

644
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:39,430
He is from the navy.
He knows swimming.

645
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:41,863
There are sharks in the water.

646
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:42,922
Oh, God.

647
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:44,792
Ms. Khushi, just relax.

648
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:47,235
Look. lt's his death wish.

649
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:50,472
lf he wants to die,
how can you save him?

650
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:55,201
As long as there is your
art of giving in this world..

00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,707
..l will keep saving him.

652

00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:08,758
Hello. Bhagat calling Bhagat.

Why don't you die?

661
00:39:17,435 --> 00:39:18,493
What to do?

662
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:20,264
Khushi doesn't let me die.

663
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:22,329
And l won't let you live.

664
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:24,435
Mr. Bhagat.

665
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:28,568

Mr. Bhagat, what are you doing?

00:39:38,356 --> 00:39:40,449
l am checking where Titanic had sunk.

670
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,291
Okay.
- What okay? Okay?

But why do you want to die?

673
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:49,389
What will l do by living?

674
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:54,237
l wish Meenu was with me
in such a big hotel's room.

675
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:57,337
Such a big bed.

l wish Meenu was with me.

680
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:09,382
Mr. Bhagat, you are
killing yourself for a girl.

681
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:10,648
Don't do that.

682
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:13,589
You will surely find love again.

683
00:40:13,658 --> 00:40:14,886
Do you remember?

684
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:17,489
ln 'Mahabharat' (Holy book)
Gandhari had blindfolded herself..

685
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:20,588
..for life for her blind husband.

686
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,792
Episode number 249.
- Yes. Yes.

687
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:25,529
But in today's world
who will be my Gandhari?

688
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:27,434
Who will love this blind man?

689
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:28,767
Tell me. Will you?

690
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,364

May be?
- Not may be. Yes or no?

692
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:35,344
Mr. Bhagat.

693
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:36,607
Yes or no?

694
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:39,443
Do you see that wave?

695
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:41,849
But.. but how can you see it?

696
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:44,614
l am not standing at a
station that a train will arrive.

697
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:46,281
l am standing in the ocean.
There is bound to be a wave.

Fine. Fine Mre. Bhagat. l..

703
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,527
Stop it, Ms. Khushi.

704
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:58,000
Don't say anything further.

705
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:00,299
Whatever you have to say,
say it to me, Ms. Khushi.

Yes. What do l do?

You explain to him.

708

You coward. You want to die.

709
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:10,810
Don't you know? The laws of
this state are very strict.

00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:12,747
lf you are caught committing suicide..

711
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:14,876
..you will be hanged on the noose.

712
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:20,352

Chetan. Chetan, what

725
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:55,182
Strange eye drops.

726
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,788
Since when have you
been wearing glasses?

727
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:57,987
Since morning.

728
00:41:58,296 --> 00:41:59,627
Since how many years?

729
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:01,688
Since childhood, Chetan.

No. lt's very expensive.

00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:16,471
You won't lose anything if you
pour just two drops, Chetan.

736
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:18,640
Give it. Give it. Art of giving.

''May nobody cast an evil
eye on your beautiful face.''

741
00:42:33,397 --> 00:42:35,957
''Begone evil eye.''

742
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:38,531
Oh god make my eyes good.

You are already blind.

779

How many times will
you lose your eyesight?

780
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,631
Chettan. Wattere. Wattere.

Do something. Poor

Just like a pregnant woman.

793
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:47,695
Pregnant woman?

794
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:52,600
l mean, getting new eyesight is
similar to giving birth to a baby.

795
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:55,870
No pain. No gain.

796
00:44:58,609 --> 00:44:59,769
'Chashme Baddoor'.

797
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:03,644
You are celebrating after
giving pain to two people.

798
00:45:03,714 --> 00:45:05,306
No need to be so happy.

799
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:06,680
Look, Bhagu.

800
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:08,810
He is dancing with the girl.

801
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:14,416
Did he really go crazy
because of the shock?

802
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:17,124
Chetu.

803
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:20,529

00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,535
..you can't see it for
seven lifetimes to come.

807
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:28,572
What did you see? What did you see?

808
00:45:28,873 --> 00:45:32,434

That's it. That's it.

820
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:27,230
That's how she jumped
when she saw me in trouble.

821
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:28,825
'Mr. Bhagu.'

822
00:46:33,404 --> 00:46:34,837

Ms. Khushi laid me on the bed.

She unbuttoned my shirt.
And wiped my body dry.

How they show in Babies add in TV.

854
00:47:55,586 --> 00:47:56,746
The same way.

855
00:47:57,988 --> 00:47:59,615
You are such a cheap man.

856
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:00,816
Cheap.

857
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:03,621
She touched my body tenderly.

858
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:04,922
And l am a cheap man.

859
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:06,693
Envious man.

860
00:48:06,764 --> 00:48:08,527
This is art of giving.

861
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:09,891
She was giving me love.

862
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:11,798
Enough.
- What happened next?

863
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,934
l started shivering from cold.

864

lt's over.

867
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:23,607
This was part one. The
second part is still left.

868
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:24,875
What else is left?

869
00:48:25,683 --> 00:48:28,413
She also removed her clothes.

870
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:29,747
Why did she remove her clothes?

871
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,310
She was also wet.

Didn't she feel ashamed?

875
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:41,923
She felt ashamed.

876
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:44,490
But she thought why to feel
shy in front of a blind man.

877
00:48:44,568 --> 00:48:45,694
What is this, Chetan?

878
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:47,327
ln your rage you forgot my character.

879
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:50,840
No. l can see your
character very clearly, Bhagu.

880
00:48:51,475 --> 00:48:52,737
To hell with the character.

881

What happened after that?

882
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:57,878
You can't do it. But at least imagine.

883
00:49:00,384 --> 00:49:03,911
No. lf Chetan finds out,
what will he say?

884
00:49:03,988 --> 00:49:04,955
Nothing.

885
00:49:05,256 --> 00:49:06,746
Art of giving.
- Giving..

886
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:22,735
Bhagu, oh my God!

887
00:49:22,806 --> 00:49:24,637
You know martial arts as well.

888
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:29,845
Khushi, don't forget
that l'm a soldier.

889
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:31,712
l'm trained for all this.

890
00:49:31,782 --> 00:49:34,216
As it is, everyone
must know self defence.

891
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:35,877
Do you know?
- No.

892
00:49:35,953 --> 00:49:37,716
Why do l need self defence?

893
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:39,722
There is security
with me all the time.

894
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,753
lmagine that they've taken a day off.

895
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:44,453
And suddenly a thief
grabs you on a remote road.

896
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:46,320
Then what will you do?

897
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:47,728
What will l do?

898
00:49:48,532 --> 00:49:49,931
l'll teach you.

899
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,231
lmagine a crazy lover. - My bag.
- Who is crazily in love with you.

900
00:49:53,304 --> 00:49:54,794
And he picks you up all of a sudden.

901
00:49:55,673 --> 00:49:56,799
Then what will you do?

902
00:49:57,608 --> 00:49:58,939
What will l do?

903
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:01,135
l'll teach you this as well.

904
00:50:01,845 --> 00:50:03,745
And he throws you on the bed.

905
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:05,747
And grabs your hands.

906
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:08,678
And locks lips with your lips.

907
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:09,946
So that you're not able to scream.

908
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,487
Then what will you do?

909
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:13,850
What will l do?

910
00:50:21,432 --> 00:50:22,899
Who?
- What are you doing, Mr. Bhagu?

911
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:24,926
Mr. Bhagu was
teaching me self defence.

912
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:26,259
ikke this.

913
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,505
l have been watching.
He has only been attacking.

914
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:30,767
He is not teaching defence.

915
00:50:30,841 --> 00:50:31,899
No. l was about to teach.

916
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:32,964
But you showed up, Mr. Chetu.

917
00:50:33,277 --> 00:50:34,301
Right. Right.

918
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:35,538
But l've come alone.

919
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:37,409
l've got a surprise.

920
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:38,846
Surprise?
- Surprise. - Yes.

921
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:40,941
Look over there. At the right.

922
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:43,651
Right.
- No Mr. Bhagu. At the right.

923
00:50:51,061 --> 00:50:52,358
Who is she?

924
00:50:58,635 --> 00:50:59,727
Bhagu darling.

925
00:50:59,803 --> 00:51:02,363
My life. My love. My sweetheart.

926
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:03,770
l'm back.

927
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:05,570
Who is she? Who are you, sister?

928
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:08,509
Sister. You didn't recognize her?

929
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:11,013
This is Ms. Meenu. Ms. Meenu.
Your lost love.

930
00:51:11,081 --> 00:51:12,912
You didn't recognize me,
Bhagu darling.

931
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:15,007
lt's your Meenu.

932
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:17,184
Where had you been leaving me?

933
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:20,381
This can't be my Meenu.

934
00:51:20,657 --> 00:51:22,716
Really? But this is
your l Phone, right?

935
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:25,286
Take a look. Take a look.

936
00:51:25,362 --> 00:51:28,559
Mr. Bhagu, this is you.
And this is your Meenu.

937
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,358
Mr. Bhagu, don't be stubborn.

938
00:51:31,435 --> 00:51:33,426
Does anyone reject love like this?

939
00:51:33,504 --> 00:51:34,732
l'm happy for you.

940
00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:35,897
We'll be friends.

941
00:51:35,973 --> 00:51:37,440
Okay. l got it.

942
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:40,636
So you are rejecting me for
this rich and beautiful girl.

943
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:42,440
No. No, sister-in-law.

944
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:43,946
This girl is like his sister.

945
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:45,481
Come on.

946
00:51:45,983 --> 00:51:47,450
This isn't my wife.

947
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:52,879
Mr. Bhagu, you remember
the tattoo of your name.

948
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:55,788
And this tattoo.

949
00:51:56,727 --> 00:52:00,493
And do you remember this tattoo?

950
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:01,622
Love you Bhagu.

951
00:52:01,698 --> 00:52:02,926
You would make me get a tattoo.

952
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,991
And you would behold
this tattoo for hours.

953
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,269
And do you want me
to show that tattoo?

954
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:09,498
Enough. Enough, sister-in-law.

955
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:10,733
You've showed enough.

956
00:52:11,008 --> 00:52:12,475
He might or might not accept.

957
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:13,874
You're sister-in-law for us.

958
00:52:14,678 --> 00:52:15,872
No Ms. Khushi. No, Ms. Khushi.

959
00:52:15,946 --> 00:52:16,913
They're lying.

960
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,540
They're trying to frame me.
- Okay. Okay. l'm wrong.

961
00:52:19,616 --> 00:52:21,413
And the tattoo is also fake. But him.

962
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:22,943
Hi!

963
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:24,584
You recognize him at least, don't you?

964
00:52:24,655 --> 00:52:28,421
Bhagu daddy. Bhagu daddy. Bhagu daddy.

965
00:52:30,494 --> 00:52:32,587
Junior Bhagu is so adorable.

966
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:33,823
Go. Go to your daddy.

967
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:35,555
Let us go, Ms. Khushi.

968
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:37,257
He is Chinese.

969
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:44,769
Wait.
- Let me go.

970
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:46,605
No. Leave me.

971
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,804
Let me go, Bhagu.

972
00:52:53,016 --> 00:52:54,608
lt's been three days.

973
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:56,585
And we didn't even come to know.

974
00:52:56,653 --> 00:52:58,985
Nor did we open the
room or the curtains.

975
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:01,286
The sun raises.. and set..

976
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:03,189
And we both..

977
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:10,260
Honey, what about the money?

978
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:13,559
Come on, silly. l'll
not take money from you.

979
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:15,998
What? Hello. My money.

980
00:53:16,673 --> 00:53:17,765
What for?

981
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:21,507
He had given me money to
be your wife only for a day.

982
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:24,604
But you kept me as
your wife for three days.

983
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:26,376
And l'm sure you enjoyed yourself.

984
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:30,479
But you also enjoyed.
Am l asking anything?

985
00:53:30,554 --> 00:53:31,748
That settles it.

986
00:53:31,822 --> 00:53:33,255
Come on, Bhagu.

987
00:53:33,323 --> 00:53:34,722
You're so cheap.

988
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:43,928
Never mind, Bhagu.

989
00:53:44,234 --> 00:53:46,429
l must not take favours from a woman.

990
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:06,347
Thanks.

991
00:54:06,423 --> 00:54:08,254
But this is a huge sum.

992
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:10,757
The job is also huge.

993
00:54:14,598 --> 00:54:15,724
Will be done.

994
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:19,896
Come. Come.

995
00:54:23,206 --> 00:54:24,901
Come. Have a seat.
- Yes.

996
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:29,436
Ms. Khushi, l have something
very important to tell you.

997
00:54:29,513 --> 00:54:30,946
Yes, tell me. What is it?

998
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:35,317

Are you sure?
- Yes.

1001
00:54:39,456 --> 00:54:41,356
l don't think you're
comfortable there.

1002
00:54:41,658 --> 00:54:43,387
Actually, you want to
sit here. Am l right?

1003
00:54:44,428 --> 00:54:45,952
Oh. No. No. l'm fine.

1004
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:48,231

Now tell me. What is it?

1012
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:09,280
Actually, Ms. Khushi, will you have
coffee or tea or juice or milk?

1013
00:55:09,353 --> 00:55:10,980
Anything. Anything.

1014
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:13,989
Will coffee do?
- Yes. Coffee is fine.

1015
00:55:14,057 --> 00:55:15,217
Coffee.

1016
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:18,386
Excuse me. Two coffees. Please.

1017
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:21,897
Are you sure you'll have coffee?

1018
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:23,257
Yes. l am sure.

1019
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:25,665
No. l feel you'll
have tea and not coffee.

1020
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,301
No. l'm fine. l like coffee.

1021
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:30,729
Ms. Khushi, you are too sweet.

1022

l know you've ordered
coffee to make me happy.

1023
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,434
Actually, you want tea.

l want coffee. l love coffee.

1026
00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:42,884
You're angry now.

1027
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:44,784
l'm not angry. l'm not angry.

1028
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:46,584
l'm not angry. l'm not angry.
- Okay.

1029
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:47,817
Tell me. What is it?

1030
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,690
Okay.

1031
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,457
Actually, are you
sure you want coffee?

1032
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,392
Oh. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1033
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:01,629
Tell me. What is it?

1034
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:03,172
Yes. Yes.

1035
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:07,966
Ms. Khushi, have you ever thought..

1036
00:56:08,478 --> 00:56:10,537
..about marriage, family, kids?

1037
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:14,772
Oh. l'm already married. Yes.

1038
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:19,846
To social service. Now Somalia,
kids are my kids.

1039
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:21,823
That is such a noble thought.

1040
00:56:21,892 --> 00:56:23,291
But forget all that.

1041
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:26,790
Have you ever thought
that a young dashing boy..

1042
00:56:27,264 --> 00:56:29,494
..would enter your life?

1043
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,762
As in?

1044
00:56:31,835 --> 00:56:33,496
As in..

1045
00:56:33,904 --> 00:56:35,303
Ms. Khushi.

1046
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:37,205
Mr. Bhagu.

1047
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:39,703
Ms. Khushi.

1048
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:44,175
Ms. Khushi.
- Mr. Bhagu.

1049
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:45,909
Who is this?

1050
00:56:45,982 --> 00:56:47,813
lt's me, Mr. Bhagu. lt's me.

1051
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:48,873
Mr. Chetu.
- You're also here.

1052
00:56:48,952 --> 00:56:50,442
Mr. Bhagu, where had you
been since so many days?

1053
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:52,914
And where are
sister-in-law and junior Bhagu?

1054
00:56:53,223 --> 00:56:54,247
Sister-in-law.

1055
00:56:54,324 --> 00:56:56,258
Yes. Where are they?

1056
00:56:57,994 --> 00:56:58,961
Bhagu, look at this.

1057
00:56:59,262 --> 00:57:00,320
'l'm sorry, Mr. Bhagat.'

1058
00:57:00,397 --> 00:57:02,922
'l was sent as your
wife with the kid.'

1059
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,632
'Mr. Bhagu, all this is a plan to
frame a decent gentleman like you.'

1060
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:10,639
'And l was given
lots of money for that.'

1061
00:57:10,707 --> 00:57:12,766
And do you know?

1062
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:14,942
Who is that? Who is that?

1063
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:17,338
Mr. Bhagu, how long
will this continue?

1064
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:18,911
You'll say something about her.

1065
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:20,647
Jiya will say something about you.

1066
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:22,514
Let it go, Mr. Bhagu. Let if go.
- Yes. Yes.

1067
00:57:22,586 --> 00:57:24,417
But how did you come
here from the hotel?

1068
00:57:24,488 --> 00:57:25,512
On a bike.
- On a bike?

1069
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:26,613
On a bike.

1070
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:28,282
He rides a bike too
although he is blind.

1071
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:30,651
Where in the army or in a circus?

1072
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:33,828
l was riding the bike and
BBC was showing me the way.

1073
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:35,797
And how will you go back?

1074
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:38,562
l will ride the bike and
Ms. Khushi will show me the way.

1075
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:40,596
How do you like the idea, Mr. Chetu?

1076
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:42,433
ldea is very good. lsn't it?

1077
00:57:42,506 --> 00:57:43,438
lt is very good.

1078
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:45,407
And also want to tell you something.

1079
00:57:45,475 --> 00:57:46,703
Let us go.
- Yes. Let us go.

1080
00:57:46,777 --> 00:57:48,369
Bye, Mr. Chetu.
- Ms. Khushi.

1081
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:50,910
Ms. Khushi, hold me tight.

1082
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:52,278
Bye, Mr. Chetu.

1083
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:53,316
Ms. Khushi.

1084
00:57:54,785 --> 00:57:57,447
l was telling. Come to the point.
Come to the point.

1085
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:58,613
Come to the point.

1086
00:57:58,688 --> 00:58:00,622
He must have reached
Nariman Point by now.

1087
00:58:01,224 --> 00:58:02,213
Not left. Straight.

1088
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:03,782
Straight.
- Okay.

1089
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:06,854
Yes. Yes. Straight. Straight.

1090
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:08,590
Very good.

1091
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:12,265
BBC, you're Bhagu's eyes, aren't you?

1092
00:58:12,636 --> 00:58:13,967
Tell me. Has he come back or no.

1093
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:15,397
He hasn't come back.

1094
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:17,201
But he had called up.

1095
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:18,665
What did he say?

1096
00:58:18,742 --> 00:58:20,767
Mr. Bhagu was riding
the bike and Ms. Khushi..

1097
00:58:20,844 --> 00:58:25,508
..was holding him tightly from behind.

1098
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:26,674
What?

1099
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,741
Handel.. what else?

1100
00:58:28,819 --> 00:58:31,287
Mr. Bhagu is enjoying a lot.

1101
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:36,690
He was saying that he will not return
till the petrol doesn't run out.

1102
00:58:45,802 --> 00:58:47,360
Just imagine, Mr. Chetu.

1103
00:58:47,437 --> 00:58:49,302
What a solid scene it must be.

1104
00:58:49,372 --> 00:58:51,237
20 years old boy. 18 years old girl.

1105
00:58:51,308 --> 00:58:52,935
Speed of 100. Empty road.

1106
00:58:53,243 --> 00:58:55,234
Hearts beating. Flowing hair.

1107
00:58:55,312 --> 00:58:56,336
Kissing the cheeks.

1108
00:58:56,413 --> 00:58:59,143
Sometimees the boyn wrould be in
ffront and sometimees the girl.

1109
00:59:07,357 --> 00:59:09,382
Sexy journey, Mr. Chetu.

1110
00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:16,626
Enough. Enough.

1111
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:43,690
Chetan and Bhagat. Conmen.

1112
00:59:44,194 --> 00:59:46,253
You beguile innocent
people by changing colours..

1113
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:49,662
..like a chameleon and then loot them.

1114
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:51,360
Lousy frauds.

1115
00:59:51,735 --> 00:59:53,726
The law here is very strict.

1116
00:59:53,803 --> 00:59:55,737
Now rot here for years.

1117
00:59:55,805 --> 00:59:58,171
Officers, take their
passports and arrest them.

1118
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:01,276
Hey! Careful.

1119
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,495
Sir. Sir, contact
the lndian embassy.

1120
01:00:26,569 --> 01:00:27,331
We need help.

1121
01:00:27,404 --> 01:00:28,530
Prithviraj Rana.

1122
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:30,304
l am from the lndian embassy.

1123
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:33,206
Keep them in
different cells, officer.

1124
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:36,536
Together, these
rascals are very dangerous.

1125
01:00:41,251 --> 01:00:43,719
Chetu, we'll settle our
scores in Madh lsland.

1126
01:00:43,787 --> 01:00:45,414
Now get me out of Thailand at least.

1127
01:00:45,488 --> 01:00:49,618
Bhagu, if l get a term,
keep Ms. Khushi happy.

1128
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:53,828
And do name your son Chetu, pal.

1129
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:55,988
Bhagu.

1130
01:00:56,299 --> 01:00:57,732
Sir. Sir, Chetan is a fraud.

1131
01:00:57,801 --> 01:00:59,564
Sir. Sir, l haven't done anything.

1132
01:00:59,636 --> 01:01:00,967
Sir, l'm completely innocent.

1133
01:01:05,909 --> 01:01:07,308
That was so much fun.

1134
01:01:07,377 --> 01:01:09,641
Darn it! l got scared in
my own plan for a second.

1135
01:01:12,682 --> 01:01:13,944
Keep him locked up for seven days.

1136
01:01:14,484 --> 01:01:16,452
And then board him on a flight
saying that you're deporting him.

1137
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:19,886
That will fix him real good.

1138
01:01:35,672 --> 01:01:36,639
Yes?
- One tequila.

1139
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:37,536
Sure, sir.

1140
01:01:37,607 --> 01:01:39,370
One more.
- One more.

1141
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:43,469
And he'll pay.

1142
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:45,838
How did you come out?

1143
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:47,476
What do you think?

1144
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:50,383
Your fake jails can
keep a real man inside.

1145
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:54,721
You gave 0.5 million.
l gave 1 million.

1146
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:56,258
And the doors of the jail opened.

1147
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:03,625
What will it take for
you to leave Ms. Khushi?

1148
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:05,833
l feel like taking your life.

1149
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:08,294
Take it.

1150
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:09,968
But sometimees it is
ffun off a difffffferrent kkind..

1151
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:11,865
..to keep your enemy alive.

1152
01:02:14,044 --> 01:02:15,773
My father would say.

1153
01:02:16,846 --> 01:02:20,373
Atttend a fffeearleess man's
ffuneral but not a cowrard's wmedding.

1154
01:02:22,385 --> 01:02:24,216
lt will be so much fun
to attend your funeral.

1155
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:26,853
Not my funeral.

1156
01:02:27,557 --> 01:02:29,354
You'll directly
attend my wedding now.

1157
01:02:29,426 --> 01:02:31,758
Do you think l'm
'Saajan's' Salman Khan..

1158
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:35,322
..that l'll hand over Ms.
Khushi to you and leave?

1159
01:02:35,698 --> 01:02:41,432
How on earth do l live without you?

1160
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:46,932
And l'm Sultan Mirza from
'Once Upon A Time ln Mumbai.'

1161
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:48,805
Sultan Mirza.

1162
01:02:49,479 --> 01:02:52,744
When l shoot from behind,
it comes out from the front.

1163
01:02:57,487 --> 01:03:02,186
Bhagu, l'm 'Vaastav's' Raghu. Raghu.

1164
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:10,592
When l shoot, you don't come
to know where the bullet..

1165
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:14,532
..enters and from
where does it come out.

1166
01:03:15,738 --> 01:03:19,834
Hey rascal. l'll fly
in the air and kick you.

1167
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:22,272
Right in the potato.

1168
01:03:23,213 --> 01:03:26,239
You will go flying in
the sky like a bird.

1169
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:29,210
Land on the ground
with massive thud.

1170
01:04:59,089 --> 01:05:00,215
Get off on me.

1171
01:05:13,203 --> 01:05:15,831
Ms. Khushi, are you okay?

1172
01:05:16,873 --> 01:05:19,171
Oh God! Thank you so much.

1173
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:21,774
Nothing can happen to
you as long as l am alive.

1174
01:05:21,845 --> 01:05:23,403
l beat those rascals into fleeing.

1175
01:05:23,947 --> 01:05:26,882
Mre. Chetu thankk ynou
ffore savving myn lifffe.

1176
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:28,383
You're a real hero.

1177
01:05:29,252 --> 01:05:31,652
Mr. Chetu, there is a
limit to lying as well.

1178
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:32,410
l beat all of them.

1179
01:05:32,722 --> 01:05:34,053
You saw how l beat them.

1180
01:05:34,124 --> 01:05:35,284
When did you beat them?

1181
01:05:35,859 --> 01:05:36,917
Come on, Mr. Bhagu.

1182
01:05:37,394 --> 01:05:39,362
You can't save yourself.

1183
01:05:39,429 --> 01:05:40,919
How can you save others?

1184
01:05:40,997 --> 01:05:44,763
Mr. Bhagu, you can't
even see. How can you fight?

1185
01:05:45,835 --> 01:05:46,859
Just be real.

1186
01:05:47,637 --> 01:05:48,797
Oh, God.

1187
01:05:49,305 --> 01:05:51,739
Mr. Chetu, let's go.

1188
01:05:51,808 --> 01:05:56,370
Oh Mr. Bhagu, you have
saved her from the goons.

1189
01:05:56,446 --> 01:06:00,041
You're Spiderman, Batman, He-man.

1190
01:06:00,116 --> 01:06:01,879
Let us go, Chetu.
l'm not feeling well.

1191
01:06:01,951 --> 01:06:03,248
Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1192
01:06:03,319 --> 01:06:07,779
Oh, brother Bhagu. How long
will you act like a handicap?

1193
01:06:07,857 --> 01:06:09,154
Do something.

1194
01:06:09,993 --> 01:06:12,086
Today Ms. Khushi also dumped me.

1195
01:06:15,131 --> 01:06:17,122
l've had enough of acting blind.

1196
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,599
Here.

1197
01:06:21,938 --> 01:06:25,101
Ms. Khushi. Ms. Khushi.

1198
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:27,775
Ms. Khushi. Ms. Khushi.

1199
01:06:27,844 --> 01:06:29,243
BBC, what happened?

1200
01:06:29,312 --> 01:06:30,836
Brother Bhagu is gone.

1201
01:06:30,914 --> 01:06:32,245
Bhagu is gone? Where?

1202
01:06:32,315 --> 01:06:34,647
He is gone upstairs.
- Upstairs.

1203
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:37,818
On a bike. That too alone.

1204
01:06:37,887 --> 01:06:39,218
But why you let him go?

1205
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:41,257
l tried really hard to
stop him, Ms. Khushi.

1206
01:06:41,324 --> 01:06:43,986
But he started saying,
''nobody loves me in this world.''

1207
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,626
Seems like today is his
last day in this world.

1208
01:06:46,696 --> 01:06:47,788
Last day.

1209
01:06:47,864 --> 01:06:48,853
Oh no!

1210
01:06:49,766 --> 01:06:53,293
My, my! She couldn't stop
herself and is rushing after Bhagu.

1211
01:06:53,403 --> 01:06:56,770
Sir. Sir, Bhagu is off again on
his bike and is up to no good.

1212
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,239
And Ms. Khushi has gone after him.

1213
01:06:59,309 --> 01:07:01,072
He is really fond of stunts, isn't it?

1214
01:07:01,811 --> 01:07:03,904
Today will be his last stunt.
- Why?

1215
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,644
Because be it love or motor cycle.

1216
01:07:07,117 --> 01:07:09,677
Break is a very
important in both the things.

1217
01:07:10,253 --> 01:07:11,845
Sir, what talent you have.

1218
01:07:54,731 --> 01:07:55,629
Doctor.

1219
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:57,290
He needs rest.

1220
01:07:58,368 --> 01:08:00,563
Bhagu, what happened to you?

1221
01:08:00,937 --> 01:08:01,995
Are you okay?

1222
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:03,368
Why don't you say something, Bhagu?

1223
01:08:03,673 --> 01:08:04,970
What happened to my Bhagu?

1224
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:07,669
Bhagu. Doctor.

1225
01:08:09,412 --> 01:08:12,939
Ms. Khushi, the one whose
name is Khushi (happiness).

1226
01:08:13,216 --> 01:08:15,150
Who gives joy to
everyone from the heart.

1227
01:08:15,218 --> 01:08:17,083
Tears don't suit her.

1228
01:08:18,121 --> 01:08:19,281
Smile please.

1229
01:08:25,762 --> 01:08:27,389
Pink lipstick suits you.

1230
01:08:28,398 --> 01:08:29,956
Bhagu, you can see!

1231
01:08:30,466 --> 01:08:32,024
This means you can see.

1232
01:08:35,438 --> 01:08:37,838
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1233
01:08:37,907 --> 01:08:38,999
l can see!

1234
01:08:39,075 --> 01:08:40,906
Ms. Khushi, l have
got my eyesight back.

1235
01:08:40,977 --> 01:08:42,535
Ms. Khushi, my eyesight..

1236
01:08:44,881 --> 01:08:47,008
You see me. Look at me.

1237
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:48,846
l can't believe it. You can see me.

1238
01:08:48,918 --> 01:08:50,044
Look at me.

1239
01:08:53,223 --> 01:08:53,917

1240
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,083
This colour you are

1241
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:57,683
Take it off. Please.

1242
01:08:58,127 --> 01:08:59,151

01:09:05,235 --> 01:09:07,760
Please take that off. Please.

But l can see things
that are at a distance.

01:09:24,821 --> 01:09:26,254
But not that are close to me.

1250

Now? lt is better?

1254
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:37,723
A bit more.

01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:41,235
Now l can see everything.

1256
01:09:41,304 --> 01:09:42,794
But l'm feeling shy.

1257
01:09:42,872 --> 01:09:43,896
So be it.

1258
01:09:44,407 --> 01:09:45,965
My vision is also coming.

1259
01:09:48,144 --> 01:09:49,907

shock because of the accident.

1270
01:10:13,303 --> 01:10:15,134
No. No. No, Mr. Bhagu.

1271
01:10:15,438 --> 01:10:17,269
That accident wasn't an accident.

1272
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,705
lt was my master-plan.

1273
01:10:18,975 --> 01:10:20,966

1274
01:10:21,044 --> 01:10:22,306

This is the art of giving.
Giving a shock.

01:12:45,688 --> 01:12:47,155
But it's so difficult to wear it.

1330

Go outside.

1348
01:13:39,408 --> 01:13:41,638

Busy doing what?

1357
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,387
He is unwell.

1358
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:57,016

1359
01:13:57,093 --> 01:13:59,357
No. No. lf he meets you,
his health will deteriorate.

01:14:22,985 --> 01:14:24,612

Come. Come.

1386
01:14:59,021 --> 01:15:00,181
She is my student.

1387
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:01,982
Mother Firangi (foreigner).

1388
01:15:02,758 --> 01:15:04,157
And l am teaching her meditation.

1389
01:15:04,226 --> 01:15:05,318
Without clothes?

1390
01:15:05,394 --> 01:15:06,759
Yes.

1391
01:15:06,829 --> 01:15:07,989
'Nagna Mukasam'.

1392
01:15:08,931 --> 01:15:11,399
lt's such a stage of
meditation where a person..

1393
01:15:11,701 --> 01:15:15,865
..removes all his
clothes and goes to God, naked.

1394
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:18,206
But Mr. Chetu, why naked?

1395
01:15:19,709 --> 01:15:20,801
Just think.

1396
01:15:21,243 --> 01:15:23,336
Does a banyan tree
ever wear undergarment?

1397
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:25,112
No.

1398
01:15:25,181 --> 01:15:26,773
Does a horse ever wear a frock?

1399
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:28,178
No.

1400
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,979
Does a goat ever wear mini skirt?

1401
01:15:30,753 --> 01:15:31,276
No.

1402
01:15:31,354 --> 01:15:32,981
So why should humans wear clothes?

1403
01:15:33,055 --> 01:15:34,147
Why?

1404
01:15:35,091 --> 01:15:36,854
That is 'Nagna Mukasam'.

1405
01:15:38,327 --> 01:15:39,089
Chetu.
- Yes.

1406
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:41,026

Firrst leearn the ordinarryn pose.

1408
01:15:43,933 --> 01:15:45,798
As it is, Ms.
Khushi, 'Nagna Mukasam'..

1409
01:15:45,868 --> 01:15:48,336
..can be enjoyed only at night.

1410
01:15:48,838 --> 01:15:50,567
Teeach me.
- Fore surre.

1411
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:56,141
What happened?

1412
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,218
lnhale like a bank loan.

1413
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:06,153
And exhale slowly like an installment.

1414
01:16:06,689 --> 01:16:09,351
Shed your inhibitions.
And come in my shelter.

1415
01:16:09,892 --> 01:16:13,589
Bhagu, he is doing yoga.

01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,226
You two, again.

1593
01:26:53,302 --> 01:26:55,964
Oh, God. Save me. Save
me from these rascals.

1594
01:26:56,038 --> 01:26:57,596
Why did that uncle
run after seeing us?

1595
01:26:58,006 --> 01:27:00,236
et's go askk him. That's betttere.
- Come on.

1596
01:27:00,309 --> 01:27:02,971
Oh, God. Where did
these two come from again?

1597
01:27:03,045 --> 01:27:04,376
O Lord, Jesus.

1598
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,615
Open Your door and take me inside.

1599
01:27:08,784 --> 01:27:10,376
O Jesus, drive them away.

1600
01:27:10,452 --> 01:27:11,316
Fathere.
- Fathere.

1601
01:27:11,386 --> 01:27:12,853
Listen to us.

1602
01:27:12,921 --> 01:27:14,912
l am not interested
in talking to you two.

1603
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:15,922
Fathere.
- Fathere.

1604
01:27:15,991 --> 01:27:17,925
''Fathere. Fathere.''

1605
01:27:17,993 --> 01:27:23,363
This is exactly how
you made a mess of me.

1606
01:27:23,732 --> 01:27:25,757
You mean we maligned you.

1607
01:27:26,335 --> 01:27:28,235
He is standing in the church.
So he cannot say it directly.

1608
01:27:28,303 --> 01:27:30,066
Right.
- So, Father.

1609
01:27:31,239 --> 01:27:33,867
Tell us in flashback.
- Okay.

1610
01:27:33,942 --> 01:27:36,172
l still remember that night.

1611
01:27:37,045 --> 01:27:39,809
That night 10 hours ago.

1612
01:27:40,649 --> 01:27:42,310
The silence of nights.

1613
01:27:42,918 --> 01:27:45,011
l was snoring.

1614
01:27:45,354 --> 01:27:47,549
And the church bell.

1615
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:55,719
Church.

1616
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,700
Fathere.
- Fathere.

1617
01:28:00,769 --> 01:28:03,169
Fathere. Fathere. Fathere.

1618
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:05,069
Why is my voice echoing?

1619
01:28:06,808 --> 01:28:07,331
Where are we?

1620
01:28:07,642 --> 01:28:08,904
Fathere.

1621
01:28:10,812 --> 01:28:12,803
There is no one here.

1622
01:28:12,881 --> 01:28:16,078
The father is taking
a nap. Let him sleep.

1623
01:28:16,351 --> 01:28:18,319
Fathere.

1624
01:28:19,154 --> 01:28:21,588
Fathere.

1625
01:28:23,825 --> 01:28:26,385
et me sleeep. Come
backk in the morning.

1626
01:28:26,461 --> 01:28:30,124
The God is resting at this hour.
- No.

1627
01:28:30,665 --> 01:28:34,601
We want to get married right now.
- We do.

1628
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:37,600
But people normally
celebrate their honeymoon at night.

1629
01:28:37,672 --> 01:28:38,696
They don't get married.

1630
01:28:38,774 --> 01:28:41,265
Look, if you disturb
God's sleep at night..

1631
01:28:41,343 --> 01:28:43,038
..the God will not spare you.

1632
01:28:43,111 --> 01:28:44,669
So come tomorrow.

1633
01:28:44,746 --> 01:28:45,770
Come tomorrowr.

1634
01:28:45,847 --> 01:28:48,213
Fathere right nowr meeans right nowr.

1635
01:28:48,283 --> 01:28:50,080
Otherwise never.

1636
01:28:50,152 --> 01:28:51,744
Okay, okay.

1637
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:54,755
Now the father will wear his
robe and assert his right.

1638
01:28:54,823 --> 01:28:57,986
So tell me who is the prince charming?

1639
01:28:58,059 --> 01:28:59,754
Who is the darling?

1640
01:28:59,828 --> 01:29:01,318
He's the darling. He's the darling.

1641
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:03,689
l am too.
- All three of you.

1642
01:29:03,999 --> 01:29:05,159
This isn't right.

1643
01:29:05,233 --> 01:29:06,291
''O Darling, darling.''

1644
01:29:06,368 --> 01:29:08,097
''O Darling, darling.''

1645
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:10,331
Control deeare control.

1646
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:11,765
Who wants to get married?

1647
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:13,272
Oh, man.

1648
01:29:13,341 --> 01:29:15,002
Man to man. No, no, no.

1649
01:29:15,076 --> 01:29:16,805
l don't conduct gay marriages.

1650
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,836
Not these two.

1651
01:29:18,914 --> 01:29:21,348
You have to get me
married to these two.

1652
01:29:21,416 --> 01:29:23,316
What? Both of them.

1653
01:29:23,385 --> 01:29:26,149
One bride two groom. ln one room.

1654
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:27,381
No, that's not possible.

1655
01:29:27,456 --> 01:29:29,048
Jesus, if that happens..

1656
01:29:29,124 --> 01:29:31,217
..then that wrill be the end.
- Fathere!

1657
01:29:31,293 --> 01:29:32,726
End of the world.

1658
01:29:32,794 --> 01:29:34,352
lt'll be a terrible catastrophe.

1659
01:29:35,397 --> 01:29:38,264
So ynou can get married to onlyn one.
- Fathere.

1660
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:41,700
ln the Mahabharata,
Draupadi married five men.

1661
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:43,237
l am marrying only two.

1662
01:29:43,305 --> 01:29:45,273
Oh, God. You are still missing three.

1663
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:46,864
Fathere.
- Sorrryn.

1664
01:29:46,942 --> 01:29:48,671
Fathere.
- Sorrryn.

1665
01:29:49,744 --> 01:29:53,236
Same to same situation
occurred 30 years ago.

1666
01:29:53,715 --> 01:29:56,081
Two friends, Peter and Pascal..

1667
01:29:56,351 --> 01:29:59,218
..fell for a girl called Julie.
- Then?

1668
01:29:59,287 --> 01:30:03,155
Then both had a
fight ffore Julie's right.

1669
01:30:03,725 --> 01:30:05,750
Peter gave a right to Pascal.

1670
01:30:05,827 --> 01:30:06,885
Pascal gave a left.

1671
01:30:06,962 --> 01:30:07,860
Pascal hit on the centre.

1672
01:30:07,929 --> 01:30:08,827
Pascal hit on the face.

1673
01:30:08,897 --> 01:30:09,795
Pascal hit on the nose.

1674
01:30:09,865 --> 01:30:11,025
But who won?

1675
01:30:11,099 --> 01:30:12,225
Peter won.

1676
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:15,326
Pascal kept hitting him and Peter won.

1677
01:30:15,403 --> 01:30:18,133
Friends iff BPascal had wron..

1678
01:30:18,206 --> 01:30:19,935
..then would he have been
standing here in the church..

1679
01:30:20,008 --> 01:30:21,339
..and ringing the bell?

1680
01:30:25,046 --> 01:30:26,673
Fathere.
- BPascal.

1681
01:30:26,748 --> 01:30:28,181
Yes, l am Pascal.

1682
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:30,047
Now you two will fight as well.

1683
01:30:30,118 --> 01:30:31,983
Whoever wins in the boxing ring..

1684
01:30:32,053 --> 01:30:34,715
..will adorn the wedding
ring on this girl's finger.

1685
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:38,721
And now l will turn into
the referee from father.

1686
01:30:38,793 --> 01:30:39,987
Start.

1687
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:41,892
Attack. Attack.

1688
01:30:43,164 --> 01:30:46,861
Attack. Attack.

1689
01:30:46,935 --> 01:30:48,334
Attack. Attack. Don't wait. Attack.

1690
01:30:48,637 --> 01:30:49,729
Move aside.

1691
01:30:50,405 --> 01:30:51,929
Attack.
- You hit me.

1692
01:30:53,308 --> 01:30:55,674
Attack. Attack.

1693
01:30:55,744 --> 01:30:56,768
Now you attack.

1694
01:30:56,845 --> 01:30:57,675
Move aside.

1695
01:30:57,746 --> 01:30:58,735
Why do you..

1696
01:30:59,114 --> 01:31:00,081
Yes..

1697
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:03,715
God bless you my child.

1698
01:31:03,985 --> 01:31:06,545
Attack. Attack.

1699
01:31:28,276 --> 01:31:29,038
What happened then?

1700
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:32,238
Then l suffered a
broken head, broken teeth..

1701
01:31:32,681 --> 01:31:35,275
..and lost interest to
see my beautiful face..

1702
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:37,284
..with my cockeye.

1703
01:31:37,586 --> 01:31:39,986
But where is our Khushi?
- l don't know.

1704
01:31:40,388 --> 01:31:43,118
You beat me up and
left from the church.

1705
01:31:43,191 --> 01:31:45,091
God will never forgive you two.

1706
01:31:54,669 --> 01:31:55,727
Stop.

1707
01:32:05,647 --> 01:32:06,705
Death in life.

1708
01:32:07,349 --> 01:32:08,816
ltem songs in movies.

1709
01:32:08,883 --> 01:32:11,113
And Anthony can come
at any time in crime.

1710
01:32:11,186 --> 01:32:12,244
That's great, sir.

1711
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,344
Now say.

Should l barge in or kill you two.

1713
01:32:18,393 --> 01:32:20,122
Bhagu, l understand that he hit me.

1714
01:32:20,195 --> 01:32:21,355
But why did you hit you?

1715
01:32:21,663 --> 01:32:25,690
You two ruined everything
on the day of my engagement.

1716
01:32:26,768 --> 01:32:27,735
You too.

1717
01:32:28,436 --> 01:32:30,199
Hey! Mama!

1718
01:32:31,206 --> 01:32:34,232
You rascals, Anthony was
defamed because of you two.

1719
01:32:34,643 --> 01:32:37,168
But the original song is,
Munni was defamed for you.

1720
01:32:37,245 --> 01:32:39,179
l am standing in the church.
l cannot say it directly.

1721
01:32:39,881 --> 01:32:41,508
Come on  shell out the moneyn.

01:32:44,953 --> 01:32:46,511
We won't give you the money.

Bhagu.

01:32:56,031 --> 01:32:58,761
You won't get anything
by shooting us, sir.

1730
01:32:58,833 --> 01:32:59,891

01:32:59,968 --> 01:33:01,196

01:43:56,157 --> 01:43:58,387
Bhagu, don't be obstinate.
l am elder to you.

1948
01:43:58,793 --> 01:44:00,090
But she is younger.

1949
01:44:00,161 --> 01:44:02,391
Age doesn't matter in love.

1950
01:44:02,797 --> 01:44:04,731
The heart's a child. lsn't it, Khushi.

1951
01:44:04,799 --> 01:44:06,266
You two are very slow.

1952
01:44:07,468 --> 01:44:09,368
l will decide who my love is.

1953
01:44:49,944 --> 01:44:52,174
Chetan.
- Bhagat.

1954
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:55,810
Chetan.
- Bhagat.

1955
01:44:56,684 --> 01:44:59,346
Chetu.
- Bhagu.

1956
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:01,187
Chetan. Bhagat.

1957
01:45:01,989 --> 01:45:04,184
Two rascals. End of story.

1958
01:45:05,126 --> 01:45:06,855
l gave you two blows in a single day.

1959
01:45:07,361 --> 01:45:10,762
l had already understood that
you two are registered rascals.

1960
01:45:12,099 --> 01:45:15,899
Then my mother said that
''Every thief has a weakness''.

1961
01:45:16,303 --> 01:45:17,668
Anthony thought.

1962
01:45:18,305 --> 01:45:20,671
Rather than finding the
weaknesses of two thief's..

1963
01:45:21,175 --> 01:45:23,040
..why don't l give
them a readymade weakness.

1964
01:45:23,344 --> 01:45:25,209
So l did. Khushi.

1965
01:45:27,214 --> 01:45:28,647
Chetu the Chetan.

1966
01:45:29,016 --> 01:45:31,177
You are no social worker.

1967
01:45:31,485 --> 01:45:33,350
Nor are you a blind man.

1968
01:45:33,888 --> 01:45:36,186
Nor am l the
daughter of a rich father.

1969
01:45:36,257 --> 01:45:38,122
l am just Anthony's girlfriend.

1970
01:45:39,093 --> 01:45:41,789
And we were all playing a charade.

1971
01:45:41,862 --> 01:45:43,693
lsn't it, darling?
- Yes, baby.

1972
01:45:46,667 --> 01:45:49,033
And in this charade
neither was that church real..

1973
01:45:49,103 --> 01:45:50,263
..nor was this Father.

1974
01:45:50,337 --> 01:45:52,703
l am just Khushi's father.

1975
01:45:52,773 --> 01:45:54,900
Father.
- My daughter.

1976
01:45:56,143 --> 01:45:58,134
My darling. My dear.

1977
01:45:58,212 --> 01:45:59,611
She is his daughter.

1978
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,377
How can she be his daughter?

1979
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:05,044
Such a fair daughter to such
a dark man. Funny, isn't it?

1980
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,378
The best is yet to come, Bhagu.

1981
01:46:12,927 --> 01:46:13,951
BBC.

1982
01:46:15,296 --> 01:46:16,285
No.

1983
01:46:17,398 --> 01:46:19,696
BBC is just room service.

1984
01:46:19,767 --> 01:46:21,359
BBC is always with the highest tipper.

1985
01:46:21,435 --> 01:46:26,805
Bhagu, l am not your eyes,
l am Anthony's binoculars.

1986
01:46:26,874 --> 01:46:30,105
l would tell him who is going where.

1987
01:46:31,078 --> 01:46:32,102
How are you?
- Very good.

1988
01:46:32,179 --> 01:46:33,976
You are wearing more clothes today.

1989
01:46:34,315 --> 01:46:36,749
Are you fine, father?
- Hello.

1990
01:46:37,251 --> 01:46:38,548
Chetu.

1991
01:46:39,186 --> 01:46:41,746
Such a big deceit to
innocent people like us.

1992
01:46:42,423 --> 01:46:44,288
l don't trust decency any longer.

1993
01:46:44,358 --> 01:46:45,689
Forget it Bhagu.

1994
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:48,121
We should not have any
connection with such cheats.

1995
01:46:48,395 --> 01:46:50,863
No girl, then no money.
- Yes.

1996
01:46:53,234 --> 01:46:54,963
Acting smart with Anthony.

1997
01:46:55,035 --> 01:46:57,629
Bhagu.
- Chetu.

1998
01:46:57,705 --> 01:47:00,936
He has seen our comedy,
nor our action..

1999
01:47:05,713 --> 01:47:06,771
Joking.
- Joking, sir.

2000
01:47:06,847 --> 01:47:07,370
Yeah.

2001
01:47:07,448 --> 01:47:08,346
ltsy-bitsy.

2002
01:47:08,649 --> 01:47:09,377
Teeny-weeny.

2003
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:12,180
Eenie-meenie.

2004
01:47:12,453 --> 01:47:13,579
No.

2005
01:47:14,788 --> 01:47:16,153
You! Go.

2006
01:47:16,223 --> 01:47:17,713
Anthony. Anthony.

2007
01:47:17,791 --> 01:47:19,122
Don't kill my brother.

2008
01:47:19,193 --> 01:47:21,991
Kill me iff ynou wrant.
- Fine.

2009
01:47:22,062 --> 01:47:24,963
You have the girl,
the money. Sir, please.

2010
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,228
Just a minute.

2011
01:47:29,236 --> 01:47:30,328
You called me brother.

2012
01:47:31,171 --> 01:47:32,661
Saved my life.

2013
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:33,866
What else could l do?

2014
01:47:34,341 --> 01:47:35,740
Sir, just a minute.

2015
01:47:35,809 --> 01:47:39,336
lf you die then who will bother me.

2016
01:47:39,413 --> 01:47:40,937
Who will trouble me?

2017
01:47:41,282 --> 01:47:42,840
You are my brother, Bhagu.

2018
01:47:46,086 --> 01:47:47,348
You are very selfish.

2019
01:47:48,122 --> 01:47:52,183
You didn't think that
what will l do without you.

2020
01:47:52,259 --> 01:47:54,989
Bhagu.

2021
01:47:56,664 --> 01:47:57,858
Enough.

2022
01:48:01,035 --> 01:48:02,161
Oh, no.

2023
01:48:03,103 --> 01:48:04,627
You made Anthony cry.

2024
01:48:05,439 --> 01:48:06,872
Okay, l won't kill you.

2025
01:48:07,141 --> 01:48:08,165
But..

2026
01:48:12,313 --> 01:48:14,679
But?
- But?

2027
01:48:21,288 --> 01:48:22,619
Bhagu.

2028
01:48:23,724 --> 01:48:25,282
Bhagu.

2029
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:26,849
Bhagu.

2030
01:48:27,695 --> 01:48:30,789
Bhagu.
- Why are you yelling?

2031
01:48:30,864 --> 01:48:32,331
l am right besides you.

2032
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:36,597
That girl got us tied up in a bag.

2033
01:48:37,037 --> 01:48:40,131
See. Didn't l tell you don't go
after her, don't after her go.

2034
01:48:40,207 --> 01:48:43,301
You used to say
''Khushi is so electrifying''.

2035
01:48:44,011 --> 01:48:46,605
Now she shocked all of us.
- l see.

2036
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:47,612
l used to say that.

2037
01:48:47,681 --> 01:48:48,943
And what did you say?

2038
01:48:49,016 --> 01:48:51,780
''What lips. What a voice''.

2039
01:48:52,119 --> 01:48:54,110
She had a thin voice..

2040
01:48:54,188 --> 01:48:56,884
..as if someone
stepped on the tail of a dog.

2041
01:48:56,957 --> 01:48:58,322
Chetu. Chetu.

2042
01:49:01,195 --> 01:49:03,129
Bhagu. Bhagu. Bhagu.

2043
01:49:04,765 --> 01:49:05,857
Bhagu. Bhagu. Bhagu.

2044
01:49:05,933 --> 01:49:06,957
Yes.

2045
01:49:07,034 --> 01:49:08,558
Thank God she left.

2046
01:49:10,638 --> 01:49:16,577
Bhagu, but she was awesome.
- Yes.

2047
01:49:17,778 --> 01:49:19,803
That Anthony took her away.

2048
01:49:28,989 --> 01:49:30,149
Why are you laughing?

2049
01:49:31,859 --> 01:49:34,726
That Anthony took Khushi away happily.

2050
01:49:34,995 --> 01:49:37,555
But he doesn't know what is
going to happen next with him.

2051
01:49:59,186 --> 01:50:01,017
Merry Christmas, everyone.

2052
01:50:01,088 --> 01:50:03,113
Anthony.
- Yes.

2053
01:50:03,757 --> 01:50:04,655
You are back.

2054
01:50:04,725 --> 01:50:06,283
Merry Christmas, mother.
- What is it?

2055
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:07,622
Your money.

2056
01:50:07,695 --> 01:50:08,889
On Christmas. Merry Christmas.

2057
01:50:08,962 --> 01:50:09,758
Thank you.

2058
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:11,593
Merry Christmas, brother.
- Merry Christmas,

2059
01:50:11,932 --> 01:50:13,991
Thank you for the surprise gifts.
- Gifts?

2060
01:50:14,068 --> 01:50:15,899
Come, come.
- Yes, you sent so many gifts.

2061
01:50:15,969 --> 01:50:16,993
Take a look. Look.

2062
01:50:17,371 --> 01:50:18,963
There are so many, isn't it?

2063
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:20,028
Who sent all this?

2064
01:50:20,107 --> 01:50:21,631
Come on  brothere don't act smarrt.

2065
01:50:21,709 --> 01:50:24,109
You sent those Santa Clause,
didn't you? - Yes.

2066
01:50:24,178 --> 01:50:26,669
You know, two Punjabi
Santa Clauses were here.

2067
01:50:26,747 --> 01:50:28,009
Santa Singh and Banta Singh.

2068
01:50:28,082 --> 01:50:30,277
And you know they sung
Jingle Bell in Punjabi.

2069
01:50:30,350 --> 01:50:31,817
''Oye Jingle, Jingle bell.''

2070
01:50:31,885 --> 01:50:32,943
This way.

2071
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:35,386
l didn't send any Santa.
- No, no, you did.

2072
01:50:35,689 --> 01:50:36,280
We took pictures.

2073
01:50:36,356 --> 01:50:37,288
Mary, show him the pictures.
- Yes, mother.

2074
01:50:37,357 --> 01:50:38,585
Look. Look at the pictures.

2075
01:50:38,659 --> 01:50:39,853
Look, look, brother.

2076
01:50:43,363 --> 01:50:44,955
Look, there they go.

2077
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:47,758
They are so nice, aren't they?

2078
01:50:47,835 --> 01:50:49,632
''Oye Jingle, Jingle bell.''

2079
01:50:49,703 --> 01:50:51,227
''Jingle all the way.''

2080
01:50:58,645 --> 01:51:00,670
''Oye Jingle, Jingle bell.''

2081
01:51:00,748 --> 01:51:02,272
''Jingle all the way.''

2082
01:51:24,037 --> 01:51:25,368
''Oye Jingle, Jingle bell.''

2083
01:51:25,672 --> 01:51:26,900
''Jingle all the way.''

2084
01:51:30,177 --> 01:51:31,576
''Jingle bell.''

And Chetan-Bhagat's money.

01:52:03,043 --> 01:52:04,305
lt's impossible to snatch them.

And yes.

A hug for your mother

..on our behalf.

2103

What is the hurry to say goodbye?

2104

..while fighting on the
border for the country.

2122
