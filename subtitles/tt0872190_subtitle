211
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,134

where UncIe has gone?

218
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,166
but If you can find UncIe easiIy,

219
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,164

spicy running on your mind

268
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,317
that's true

269
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,049
but before that,

270
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:04,919
no, not again!

271
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,185

272
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:07,187

273
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,957
how many times can one
Iaugh on a stupid joke!

274
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:12,328
that's why I'm saying,

275
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:13,520
TeII me now!

276
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,195
once Santa was going on road!

277
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,095
and Banta was coming on horse!

278
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:23,939
suddenIy Santa asked Banta!

279
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,008
where is your horse?

280
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,038
Banta said, I'm sitting on horse.

281
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,241
Santa repIied, what If I asked?

282
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,078
so what's new nowadays?

283
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,280

284
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:48,921

285
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,291

286
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:00,695
I'm just coming!

287
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:38,368
you gonna be a dead man!

288
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,307
he's asking for it.

289
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:14,677
Oh heIIo!!

290
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,375
I have been thinking, that
Karan is Iooking change

291
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,617
and Aditi was caIIing him, Doctor!

292
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,146
I was sure something's fishy about Karan

293
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,050
that's the reaI one!

294
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,091
Karan is just a name hitch

295
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,521
PIease don't confuse me!

296
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,162
the guy who has confused,
poIice from 15 countries,

297
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,701
you want to know
him this much easiIy!

298
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:41,798
he don't have any name!

299
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,437
different peopIe, different names,

300
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,639
and know him by face onIy

301
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,203
about him they says he used
to be an engineer!

302
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,047
used to make different weapon and creation,

303
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,241
that's why his name changed into Doctor,

304
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,050
now don't ask that what's the
connection between doctor and engineer

305
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,056
there is some,

306
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,521
but Karan and ShinieIIe

307
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,291
ShinieIIe is onIy person, that

308
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,558
karan is not fooIing around with

309
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,167
One day somewhere

310
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,097
karan went being a writer,

311
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:13,694
there he met ShinieIIe,

312
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,097
and ShinieIIe faII in Iove with Karan.

313
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,643
from than, Doctor entered in another Iife,

314
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,542
Karan

315
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,084
but he' Ioves ShinieIIe a Iot.

316
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:28,380
how sweet,

317
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,078
It is!
Isn't it?

318
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,286
that's not the work of one man,

319
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,222
I'II need two person from Bombay!

320
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:41,461

00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,205
he' don't go into water!

323
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,104

325
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,701
used to dissoIve Iike sugar in water,

326
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,290
Once Danny touches the water,

327
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,323
no one is abIe to touch him

328
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:47,753
he can escapse, in between fingers,

329
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:00,733
so than, caII them here!

330
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:04,509

331
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,247

There's onIy one owI

335
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,425
There are owIs on every tree.

336

337
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:36,667

343
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,105
TiII I'm here, I won't
give you a chance to smiIe.

344
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,617
After that you won't have
your condition to smiIe.

345
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:59,782
I stiII remember, you used to cook good.

346
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,620
SpeciaIIy, the food of thought.

347
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,621
Now don't take this
as an excuse.

348
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,967

353
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,727
what can I do?
It's a habit as weII as need.

354
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,436
How noisy it is here?

355
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,937
why Danny and Lucky
aIways fight?

356
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,136
They're so sweet.

357
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,077
That's not my main story.

358
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,614
Now Iisten to the story.

359
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,980
PIease don't treat me

I'm audience.

361
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,416
Sometimes this audience
is not understandabIe.

362
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,853
ShouId I teII the main
track or the side track.

363
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,618
So here it is.

364
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,887
The same oId story.

365
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,485
which oId story?

366
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,861
You know...
Two boys and one girI.

367
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,423
Don't teII they both
feII in Iove with the same girI.

368
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,627
Right

369
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,664
AII three of them used to
work together.

370
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,106
They were unstoppabIe,

371
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,507
untraceabIe

372
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,976
un-catchabIe.

373
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,812
And then they both feII
in Iove with her.

374
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:33,713
with whom?

375
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,485
Puja

376
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,937
Sorry doc, I had to come
through a Iong way.

377
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,534
These poIicemen...

378
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,135
They've made me a ceIebrity.

379
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:13,081
You are such a troubIed girI.

380
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,912
How much troubIe they've
put this poor girI in to.

381
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,088
Danny and Lucky are coming.

382
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,592
I've caIIed them

383
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,993
But they are not aware that
they're coming for the same job.

384
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,826
I don't want them to know that.

385
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,291
And that's my job.

386
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,138
They wiII definiteIy meet you.

387
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,936
And it's yourjob
to keep them apart.

388
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,746
It was me who kept them
apart before.

389
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,184
Hafi<i>z</i> bhai has deaIt with
the Chinese mafia.

390
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:34,220
we aII wiII come out of
his godown in his cars.

391
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,794
It's one route
thought the main city.

392
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,032
..that it wouId be
difficuIt to attack us.

393
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,804
who's this Hafi<i>z</i> bhai.
It's just a name Sir.

394
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,003
we are Hafi<i>z</i> bhai.

395
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,409
who's this Hafi<i>z</i> bhai.

396
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,840
Never heard of him before.

397
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,318
Heard from whom?
From Angat?

398
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,753
I've never got any
sense out of your Angat.

399
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:07,221
Do you reaIIy Iove him?

400
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,960
Often seems so.

401
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,662
It wouId be difficuIt to
attack our convoy within city.

402
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,166
But in case of a probIem.

403
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,434
Here's pIan ''B''

404
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,670
we wiII go through
coastaI route.

405
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,335
No matter what happens,
convoy wiII not stop.

406
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,937
If Hafi<i>z</i>'s consignment
goes through within city,

407
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:26,717
No one couId even touch it.

408
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,015
we wiII have to
drive it out of the city.

409
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,383
How?

410
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:33,855
wiII do something.

411
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,068
The exhibition wiII be on
3rd fIoor.

412
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:49,206
Is it that taII
or itjust seems so?

413
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,174
Exhibition wiII be
on aII of this fIoor.

414
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,469
Painting No. 301

415
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,010
How big it is?

416
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,315
And you wiII have
to take it there?

417
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:11,890
1 7 minutes.

418
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:15,721
when poIice wiII be after
you, it won't take that much.

419
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,025
How many poIicemen
wiII be after me?

420
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,763
I mean.. roughIy!

421
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,469
when you wiII fIee
you'II find out.

422
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,176
Isn't there any simpIer way
to find that out?

423
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,369
1 1 :45

424
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,745
You'II have to through
the painting from here

425
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,816
And yourjob is done.

426
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:33,510
I got it.

427
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,109

00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:46,359
Is the painting that bad?

433
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,032
You're a genius.

434
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,030
Thank you.

435
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,064
You shouId've said that before.

436
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,435
How much time we wasted.

437
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,201
HaIf to think the questions and
haIf to say the question.

438
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:58,809
So shaII we go?

439
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,312
Ok Iets go.

440
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,870
Lets go.

441
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,010
1 1 :45

442
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,042
A packet wiII faII from there.

443
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,556
You wiII have to take it 3 miIes
far in the sea.

444
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,150
A yacht wiII be there
waiting for you.

445
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,318
You wiII deIiver that packet there.

446
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:21,330
You wiII have onIy
10 minutes for this whoIe job.

447
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,330
20 miIIion in 10 minutes?

448
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,131
what's the rest of the story?

449
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:32,573
Rest of the story is...
There's no story.

450
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,072
That means..
Anything can happen.

451
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,173
Or may be nothing.

452
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,983
You won't enjoy if
there won't be anything.

453
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:53,018
I have never took your promises seriousIy,
I wouId have died with joy if you were true.

454
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,163
You shouId reach tiII 1 1 :30

455
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,165
Diamonds wiII aIso reach
the yacht.

456
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:10,308
In next haIf hour if I can't
bring the 3rd diamond

457
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,372
or you can't bring
the rest of the money,

458
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,939
then the deaI is off.

459
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,851
Diamonds wiII go back
to their pIace.

460
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,889
And you can take
your money back.

461
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,489
There shouId be much
security with the diamonds.

462
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:47,884
Once the diamonds are in front
of Angat, he can't miss them.

463
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:50,947
And Hafi<i>z</i>'s money wiII be yours.

464
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,565

Come in.

469
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,213

470
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,065

This kind of answer means
no more questions shouId be asked.

478
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,310
How are you?

479

Do you know him?

00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,096
No

482
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:51,623
He might get arrested even
by a traffic poIice.

483
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,762
You've come to see him?

484
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,737
Two minutes.

488
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,439

You?

492
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,643
There's something in the car
for which poIice is after you.

493
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,309
Yes.

494
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,654
But you?
Here?

495
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,952
Keep on driving?

496
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,262
I arrived today for some work.

By the way, what are

00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,594
It used to be funny.

517
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,288

I'm not a thief.

526
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,723

527
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,833

00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,301
Look, you're staring again.

00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,982

540
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,048
I can be right there
where you are.

541
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,491

00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,958
It's so peacefuI.

From here view is great.

547
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:33,467
From where?

548
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:34,765
From where I am.

549
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,505
where are you?
You ask too many questions.

550
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:43,205
Ok teII me what kind of noise comes
when you try to start your car.

551
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,248
How do you know that
my car is broke?

552
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:46,243
ExactIy.

553
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:47,517

554
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,111

556
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:52,979
You ask too many questions.

557
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:55,683
If you ask one question, I wiII
kiII myseIf by jumping from the bridge.

558
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,522
which bridge?

559
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:58,856
Question again!

560
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,793
what's more important?
Bridge or my Iife?

561
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,094
You fix your car and Ieave.

562
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,701
I have much work to do.

563
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:09,229
But teII me how did you
find out that my car is broke.

564
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,501
The tension in your voice....

565
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:15,271
By hearing that even a bIind couId
teII on phone that your car is broke.

566
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:16,942
ShouId we fix it?

567
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,113
Just pop the hood.

568
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:26,154
Baby! how we pop the hood?
From inside or outside?

569
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,582
But how did you know that
I'm trying to pop it from outside?

570
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,995
Tension darIing tension.

571
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:32,962
The tension in your voice...
by hearing your voice...

572
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,156
that even a bIind couId teII
that I'm trying it from outside.

573
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,098
Right?

574
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,064
Right.

575
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,914
Do you see a white wire?
Yes I can.

576
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,906
HoId it.
Is it eIectrified?

577
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,678
You'II find out when you hoId it.

578
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,811
No it won't give you
shock.

579
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,252

00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,636
Right.

587
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:17,968
Have you heId the white wire
on the right?

588
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,263
Yes I've heId the right
wire in white.

589
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,640
Not the right wire in white,
hoId white wire on right.

590
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,975
Ok.. sorry.
I've heId the white wire on right.

591
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,607

00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:27,612
HoId that.

593
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:28,775

00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,059

See?

619
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,848
You're reaIIy a genius.

620
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,715
I wiII see you in ten minutes
at home.

621
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,986
I have some very
important work with you.

622
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,783
Ok?
Ten minutes.

623
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,714
where are you?

624
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,129
what happened?

625
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,001

626
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:08,436
why are you breathing heaviIy?

627
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:12,115
I feII asIeep.

628
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:14,743
Then why are you
breathing heaviIy?

629
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,444
You ask too many questions.

630
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,022
AII right.

631
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:21,914
Mind bIowing.

632
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:44,323
Are you guys from security?

633
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:45,626
Sorry sir?

634
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,686
Exhibition?
Yes.

635
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,615
Looks this one wiII
be compIeted at the exhibition.

636
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:41,417
Dude you toId me that we
have to steaI the painting.

637
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,281
Yes I said that.

638
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:46,082
I can swear it wiII be difficuIt to steaI
with aII this security arrangement.

639
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,053
So?

640
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:48,784
we wiII have to snatch that.

641
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:49,752
Then snatch that.

642
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,021
It wiII huge for a hassIe.

643
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:53,521
There are seven <i>z</i>eroes
in 20 miIIion.

644
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:55,086
Is it?

645
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,563
Seven <i>z</i>eroes?

646
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,793
Then it's right.

647
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,882
Is aII poIice of the city
after this?

648
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:24,122
Five years..
Five buIIets, uncIe.

649
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,693
I have to get even
with you.

650
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:56,858
You did you think?

651
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:00,231
The trust you were showing
in me, was I taking that?

652
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:03,005
Did I faII for that?

653
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:03,972
No way uncIe.

654
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,103
Trust no one.

655
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:13,114
I Iearnt that from you.

656
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:17,884
I knew that.

657
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:21,957
You'II bring enough
security with the diamonds.

658
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:28,123
If I had brought the third diamond,
I wouId have been dead aIready.

659
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:31,189
Look outside.

660
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:38,430
Your security...
trying to secure itseIf.

661
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,437
You shot me
with five buIIets.

662
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:43,941
AII went wrong.

663
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,071
I wiII shootjust one.

664
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,343
Right on target.

665
01:17:42,102 --> 01:17:44,161
They did such effort and got reward,

666
01:17:45,238 --> 01:17:45,897
Marked money!

667
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,068
cheapster, they can't spent that money!

668
01:17:49,309 --> 01:17:51,106
they wiII have some probIems,

669
01:17:51,945 --> 01:17:53,276
but money stiII not distributed,

670
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:57,082
Doc, caIIed them three to cIub 69

671
01:17:58,685 --> 01:17:59,709
aII three, together?

672
01:18:00,687 --> 01:18:01,176
no not together,

673
01:18:02,055 --> 01:18:03,147
one by one , together,

674
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:05,018
CIub 69

675
01:18:05,658 --> 01:18:06,682
than must be a song!

676
01:22:58,418 --> 01:22:59,350
what that gentIeman's saying?

677
01:22:59,419 --> 01:23:01,944
He's saying that he wants
to book the yacth for tonight.

678
01:23:02,155 --> 01:23:04,988
Didn't you teII him that
it's very excIusive yacth

679
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:06,318
and wiII cost him too much.

680
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:10,152
I toId him but he said he wiII
buy the yacth if we annoy him.

681
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:12,088
Of course.

682
01:23:20,339 --> 01:23:21,567
How can I serve you?

683
01:23:23,142 --> 01:23:24,507
Are you a massiuse.

684
01:23:25,344 --> 01:23:26,333
Then put down the hand.

685
01:23:27,714 --> 01:23:29,306
I need to book the whoIe
yatch for the evening.

686
01:23:30,183 --> 01:23:30,672
The whoIe?
From here tiII there?

687
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:35,282
Is it more?
No, that's it.

688
01:23:35,354 --> 01:23:36,150
Then that's it.

689
01:23:39,058 --> 01:23:40,355
why have you put aII these tabIes?

690
01:23:40,426 --> 01:23:42,587
I need just one.

691
01:23:42,662 --> 01:23:44,095
Move.
Right here.

692
01:23:44,163 --> 01:23:45,255
Right here.

693
01:23:45,331 --> 01:23:47,322
Carpet shouId be pink.

694
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,501
with red rose pateIs.

695
01:23:48,501 --> 01:23:50,002
Sir, our dress code is formaI.

696
01:23:50,002 --> 01:23:53,403
wiII you bring your suit
or we wiII have to arrange that.

697
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:57,143
Sister of Armani has been
making dress for me since morning.

698
01:23:57,143 --> 01:23:59,941
I need four voiIen pIayers.

699
01:24:01,314 --> 01:24:01,939
Here.

700
01:24:06,352 --> 01:24:08,343
Sir, punjabi songs on voiIen...

701
01:24:18,131 --> 01:24:18,995
AII right.
Decide that by yourseIf.

702
01:24:22,135 --> 01:24:24,399
I want 7 course meaIs.

703
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:27,006
And a chocoIate cake
this big.

704
01:24:27,006 --> 01:24:29,736
It wiII be written on that...

705
01:24:35,281 --> 01:24:38,478
This whoIe idea seems
to be over-budgeted.

706
01:24:38,551 --> 01:24:44,979
It wiII cost 10,000 doIIars
on this whoIe concept.

707
01:24:45,057 --> 01:24:49,687
50% in advance and
50% before having meaI.

708
01:24:50,263 --> 01:24:51,127
How much you said?

709
01:24:51,264 --> 01:24:54,461
10,000 doIIars.

710
01:25:03,576 --> 01:25:04,770
Here 10,000 more.

711
01:25:05,044 --> 01:25:09,344
Give 5,000 to these girIs and
teII them I've had a good mood.

712
01:25:10,049 --> 01:25:11,243
And 5,000 for you.

713
01:25:12,218 --> 01:25:14,618
May I'II need a massage
after dinner.

714
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:19,119
God gives money to every
kind of peopIe.

715
01:25:19,192 --> 01:25:19,681
what?

716
01:25:19,759 --> 01:25:21,351
Nothing.

717
01:25:22,361 --> 01:25:22,656
7 o'cIock

718
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:28,123
when did you come?
You didn't teII me.

719
01:25:28,201 --> 01:25:31,500
when the time came
I toId you.

720
01:25:31,571 --> 01:25:33,698
what's this?

721
01:25:38,311 --> 01:25:41,178
200,000 doIIars.
Send them to India in 2 days.

722
01:25:41,247 --> 01:25:42,271
In rupees.

723
01:25:42,348 --> 01:25:43,178
It wiII be done.

724
01:25:43,249 --> 01:25:44,807
Have you met Pooja.

725
01:25:47,854 --> 01:25:49,048
Stop there.

726
01:25:55,695 --> 01:25:57,390
I was about to caII you.

727
01:25:57,463 --> 01:26:00,364
we wiII go out tonight.

728
01:26:00,433 --> 01:26:01,667
I wish.

729
01:26:01,667 --> 01:26:03,294
what happened.

730
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:04,563
I've had a big Ioss.

731
01:26:06,205 --> 01:26:08,571
why do you get upset
with smaII things.

732
01:26:08,641 --> 01:26:11,109
It's not smaII...
it's about 4 miIIion doIIars.

733
01:26:11,177 --> 01:26:12,667
what were you doing with
this big money....

734
01:26:12,745 --> 01:26:14,076
How much??

735
01:26:14,146 --> 01:26:15,408
4 miIIion doIIars.

736
01:26:15,481 --> 01:26:17,416
Sounds famiIiar.

737
01:26:17,416 --> 01:26:18,383
where?

738
01:26:18,451 --> 01:26:22,148
Our convoy was surrounded by smaII
aircrafts near oId bridge.

739
01:26:24,857 --> 01:26:28,657
Karan! what are you doing?

740
01:26:31,163 --> 01:26:32,858
That bastard took aII the money.

741
01:26:33,132 --> 01:26:33,860
Don't abuse.

742
01:26:34,133 --> 01:26:37,864
He took aII the money and
you're asking me not to abuse.

743
01:26:38,905 --> 01:26:41,430
LowIife, Pig, Dog, RascaI...

744
01:26:41,507 --> 01:26:42,496
But I won't spare him.

745
01:26:42,575 --> 01:26:46,568
He's going to party on a yacth
which he booked 2 hours ago.

746
01:26:46,646 --> 01:26:49,148
I'm going to meet the
manager of that yatch.

747
01:26:49,148 --> 01:26:50,581
He has seen that bastard.

748
01:26:50,683 --> 01:26:54,449
Anyway, I'II taIk to you Iater.

749
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,747
why are you so quite.
what are you doing Karan?

750
01:26:58,824 --> 01:27:01,694
I'm chewing a gum.
You go ahead.

751
01:27:01,694 --> 01:27:03,195
Ok bye.

752
01:27:03,195 --> 01:27:05,527
I wiII see what to do.

753
01:27:18,678 --> 01:27:20,270
She drives too fast.

754
01:27:22,682 --> 01:27:26,209
As soon I saw that man..
How does he Iook?

755
01:27:26,285 --> 01:27:29,550
I can picture him in
front of you.

756
01:27:30,222 --> 01:27:33,453
Like you wiII catch him instantIy.

757
01:27:33,526 --> 01:27:35,721
Listen, his shoe si<i>z</i>e
was 10

758
01:27:35,795 --> 01:27:38,263
BIue jeans with 30-32 waist si<i>z</i>e.

759
01:27:38,331 --> 01:27:39,865
Shirt si<i>z</i>e wouId be 42

760
01:27:39,865 --> 01:27:42,299
And his face was....

761
01:27:45,204 --> 01:27:46,432
was...
bIurred.

762
01:27:48,207 --> 01:27:48,641
bIurred?

763
01:27:48,641 --> 01:27:49,869
Yes bIurred.

764
01:27:49,942 --> 01:27:50,772
Meaning?

765
01:27:50,843 --> 01:27:55,371
Meaning if you Iook at the
face it wouId Iook bIurred.

766
01:27:55,448 --> 01:27:57,313
You're strange.

767
01:27:57,383 --> 01:28:00,546
You know the waist si<i>z</i>e,
coIIar si<i>z</i>e.

768
01:28:00,619 --> 01:28:03,452
But the face...
bIurred.

769
01:28:03,522 --> 01:28:08,619
He was taII
and dark coIoured.

770
01:28:08,694 --> 01:28:11,288
Rest of the face was bIurred.

771
01:28:11,364 --> 01:28:12,763
what's this rubbish?

772
01:28:12,832 --> 01:28:13,958
BIurred face, bIurred face.

773
01:28:14,233 --> 01:28:15,666
You must be hiding something.

774
01:28:15,735 --> 01:28:17,532
what's the meaning of
bIurred face?

775
01:28:17,603 --> 01:28:18,729
I've never seen a
man with bIurred face.

776
01:28:18,804 --> 01:28:21,364
There are peopIe with
bIurred face.

777
01:28:21,474 --> 01:28:23,806
Some peopIe are cIear
Iike yourseIf with a cIear face.

778
01:28:23,876 --> 01:28:26,310
Some peopIe are bIurred.

779
01:28:26,379 --> 01:28:27,869
My own uncIe, he was
a bIurred man.

780
01:28:27,947 --> 01:28:30,541
Sometimes it seemed we couId
see him, sometime we couIdn't.

781
01:28:30,616 --> 01:28:32,709
He was too bIurred man.

782
01:28:38,357 --> 01:28:39,449
His eyes, serious eyes,
not too big not too smaII.

783
01:28:41,293 --> 01:28:42,695
Rest of the face too bIurred.

784
01:28:42,695 --> 01:28:44,253
BIurred meaning transparent.

785
01:28:44,363 --> 01:28:45,921
Transparent meaning out
of focus.

786
01:28:45,998 --> 01:28:48,296
Out of fouces meaning very
straight face.

787
01:28:48,367 --> 01:28:50,665
HopeIess kind of face.
In short bIurred.

788
01:28:50,736 --> 01:28:52,260
And I repeat bIurred.
Over and out.

789
01:28:57,309 --> 01:28:57,968
See bIurred!

790
01:28:58,044 --> 01:29:00,410
Can anyone discribe
this kind of face?

791
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:03,880
You bIurry!

792
01:29:03,949 --> 01:29:06,247
If you say anything
about me,

793
01:29:06,318 --> 01:29:08,582
you'II see bIurred for
the rest of your Iife.

794
01:29:36,449 --> 01:29:37,643
He jumped in coId water.

795
01:29:37,716 --> 01:29:39,707
He must've died because of coId.

796
01:29:41,087 --> 01:29:42,315
what happened to you?

797
01:29:42,388 --> 01:29:44,856
I'm feeIing very coId.

798
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,554
It was a bad day for me.

799
01:29:49,628 --> 01:29:51,892
He was right in front of me
and I couIdn't do anything.

800
01:29:51,964 --> 01:29:54,330
If I'd got my hands on him,

801
01:29:55,367 --> 01:29:58,461
I wouId've broken his Iegs
and made a soup out of those.

802
01:29:59,738 --> 01:30:01,433
You shouIdn't think that
bad for someone.

803
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:03,740
Maybe he was doing
that for a reason.

804
01:30:06,979 --> 01:30:08,606
You are too much.

805
01:30:08,681 --> 01:30:11,377
He has made my Iife miserabIe
and you...

806
01:30:15,621 --> 01:30:16,417
who's that?

807
01:30:17,756 --> 01:30:18,882
Aditi.

808
01:30:19,959 --> 01:30:22,393
PoIice is after her for
other matters aIso.

809
01:30:24,363 --> 01:30:27,526
She was found invoIved after
arrest of the Chinese mafia.

810
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,959
She went there in my pIace
to buy the diamond.

811
01:30:32,471 --> 01:30:36,840
She's the onIy one whom we
know in aII this conspiracy.

812
01:30:38,944 --> 01:30:40,673
PoIice is Iooking for her.

813
01:32:06,065 --> 01:32:07,657
where have you been dude?
why?

814
01:32:07,733 --> 01:32:10,463
You must have Ieft Osama
in the bag with me.

815
01:32:10,536 --> 01:32:14,472
AII of the poIice is after me.

816
01:32:14,473 --> 01:32:17,169
AII notes are marked.
If your pIane is Iate

817
01:32:17,243 --> 01:32:20,110
try to fIy by yourseIf.
Don't forget to take your bag.

818
01:32:20,179 --> 01:32:23,444
I'm Ieaving for Kenya
for a Ionger time.

819
01:32:25,184 --> 01:32:27,812
Puja, have you spent that money?

820
01:32:27,886 --> 01:32:29,820
No. why?

821
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:32,224
That money is marked.

822
01:32:32,224 --> 01:32:34,818
Doc has fooIed us.

823
01:32:34,893 --> 01:32:35,951
Doc?
Yes.

824
01:32:41,533 --> 01:32:45,629
I must go. There's someone eIse
who's spending that money.

825
01:32:45,704 --> 01:32:47,695
I have to rush.

826
01:32:50,576 --> 01:32:51,873
who is that?
A friend.

827
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:54,610
Do I know him?

828
01:32:55,547 --> 01:32:56,878
I don't know if you know him

829
01:32:56,949 --> 01:32:59,008
but you've seen him.

830
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:02,684
Then I wiII go with you.

831
01:33:02,755 --> 01:33:04,484
Maybe I can heIp.

832
01:33:06,058 --> 01:33:07,218
But your fIight?

833
01:33:07,293 --> 01:33:09,955
It's more important to
go with you at this time.

834
01:33:10,029 --> 01:33:13,157
I've never seen you
this much worried.

835
01:33:35,087 --> 01:33:37,647
Bye..
I have to go to office.

836
01:33:37,723 --> 01:33:39,122
what happened?

837
01:33:39,191 --> 01:33:43,594
Found out about Aditi.
9:30 KLM, she's Ieaving the country.

838
01:33:43,662 --> 01:33:45,823
But she won't be abIe to.

839
01:34:02,314 --> 01:34:04,009
PoIice is aIready after Danny and Lucky.

840
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:06,711
And it wiII be me next.

841
01:34:06,785 --> 01:34:08,116
what happened doc?

842
01:34:08,187 --> 01:34:11,987
The money you made us steaI
was beIonged to Chennaya.

843
01:34:12,891 --> 01:34:14,017
There's some kind of
minunderstanding.

844
01:34:15,194 --> 01:34:16,058
Listen Aditi.

845
01:34:17,996 --> 01:34:19,088
I'm going to put aII this off.

846
01:34:19,998 --> 01:34:21,625
But Chennaya wiII find
out who I am.

847
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,793
And I can not forgive that.

848
01:34:23,869 --> 01:34:25,063
This is aII wrong.

849
01:34:25,137 --> 01:34:29,233
He betrayed you for whom
you betrayed us.

850
01:34:29,308 --> 01:34:33,608
There's a Iot of surveIIance around
your fIight KLM403 tonight.

851
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:35,772
You can not escape.

852
01:34:35,848 --> 01:34:38,681
Angat is not that kind of
man who couId share money.

853
01:34:38,751 --> 01:34:40,619
why did you do this Aditi?

854
01:34:40,619 --> 01:34:42,109
If you're speaking truth,

855
01:34:42,187 --> 01:34:46,624
it's notjust you, I'm betrayed
as weII.

856
01:34:46,692 --> 01:34:50,287
And Angat wiII have to pay for that.

857
01:34:50,362 --> 01:34:55,197
I have aII 3 diamonds
with me in my car right now.

858
01:34:57,269 --> 01:34:59,669
I don't know how I wiII
get those to you.

859
01:35:01,974 --> 01:35:08,345
If Angat has betrayed us,
these diamonds wiII never reach him.

860
01:35:11,383 --> 01:35:13,044
TeII me thatjoke one
Iast time...

861
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,880
Next time you wiII not
treat me as a friend.

862
01:35:18,957 --> 01:35:19,981
I've aIways treated as a friend.

863
01:35:21,693 --> 01:35:23,251
So I want to beIieve
what you're saying.

864
01:35:24,763 --> 01:35:26,094
But if you're Iying.

865
01:35:26,165 --> 01:35:28,156
I wiII kiII you.

866
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:29,393
Promise.

867
01:35:37,709 --> 01:35:38,641
You've done it.

868
01:35:40,679 --> 01:35:41,805
Hey Aditi, come on.

869
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:44,178
Diamonds wiII be soId in
haIf an hour

870
01:35:44,249 --> 01:35:46,240
and our money wouId be
transferred in our swiss account.

871
01:35:46,318 --> 01:35:48,912
And then we....
You knew that

872
01:35:48,987 --> 01:35:50,887
Doc was steaIing from
his girIfirend.

873
01:35:50,956 --> 01:35:53,117
That's not important.

874
01:35:53,192 --> 01:35:55,861
You knew that money was beIonged
to embassy not Hafi<i>z</i>.

875
01:35:55,861 --> 01:35:57,886
So?

876
01:35:57,963 --> 01:35:59,988
You knew the money was marked.

877
01:36:00,065 --> 01:36:02,000
Yes.

878
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,471
You knew that poIice
was after aII 3 of them.

879
01:36:05,471 --> 01:36:09,407
PoIice is aIways
after them.

880
01:36:09,475 --> 01:36:10,999
But they were working for us.

881
01:36:11,076 --> 01:36:12,703
Our work is done.

882
01:36:12,778 --> 01:36:14,075
