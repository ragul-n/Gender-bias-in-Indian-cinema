1
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,590
Goa was the homeland
of Konkanis, who belonged to...

2
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,162
Brahmin community and
businessmen by profession

3
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:22,496
ln 15th century their foundation
was shaken when...

4
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,660
when the Portuguese took over Goa

5
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:29,540
Devanagiri was forbidden
and Roman script imposed

6
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,142
And with forced religious conversions
the Portuguese turned...

7
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:37,205
...the peaceful lives of Konkanis into hell

8
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,913
Konkanis soon left their
hometown and started...

9
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,787
...moving out to settle down
in other states

10
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,992
Most of them migrated to the Deccan

11
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,227
To areas like Mangalapuram and Malabar

12
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,705
The Kozhikode King
refused them shelter, but...

13
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,799
...Keshava Rama Varma,
King of Kochi welcomed them

14
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:12,140
With their own efforts they rose in fields
of trade, commerce and medicine

15
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,186
With a stamp of
their own personality...

16
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,315
...they occupied high posts
and received recognition

17
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:26,528
Out of the 5 major
sections amongst Konkanis...

18
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,795
...the 1st was the Gowda Saraswada Brahmin

19
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,804
To which belonged the Kamaths
who have their roots...

20
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,138
...entwined with Malayalam,
and is the subject of this narration

21
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:47,218
A silk saree for my wife
She likes rich red color

22
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,556
An off-white silk veshti
and shirt for my older son

23
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,299
Knee length knickers
and a shirt for my younger son

24
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,335
Looks like you got your
bonus money Kamath?!

25
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,707
My boss gave me enough
After all it's Deepavali festival

26
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:18,007
Today is Deepavali

27
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,110
Brother, he will buy us crackers
and sparklers, won't he?

28
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,712
Don't expect too much

29
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:33,028
Hey! Thief! Thief!

30
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,377
We could save his life only because
he was brought here on time

31
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,646
- We are very grateful
- Your gratitude must be expressed to him

32
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,417
What is your name?

33
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:05,130
Gopi, l saw Muthu snatch
your dad's bag and run

34
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,394
lf you buy me 'Puttu' and beef curry
l will show you who he is

35
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:20,978
We are Kamath's sons
Gives us back our dad's bag

36
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,116
Get lost! What will you do if l don't?
Bash me up?

37
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:29,812
Kamaths were not born
to beat, is what our dad taught us

38
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:34,090
But if you insist on being beaten up...
Hey Gopi!!!

39
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:45,026
2 cups of strong tea
2 'puttus' and beef curry for our Gopi

40
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,000
Come

41
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,264
ls Kamath in?

42
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,008
Look, your credit
at my provision shop has crossed limits

43
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,707
l need
a payment immediately

44
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,875
l will pay you
Please give me some time

45
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,281
Even if l gave you time
how will you earn?

46
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,787
Without your legs
whatjob can you go for?

47
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,289
l want my money immediately

48
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,393
We will return your
money in a week's time

49
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,326
You?!

50
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,996
We are starting a business

51
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,706
Wonderful! The little Kamaths'
dosa(pancake) tastes great

52
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,936
Very smart boys
What is the name of your shop?

53
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,713
Kamath and Kamath Proprietors
Kamath and Kamath

54
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,856
Biriyani Street Est 1587
Biriyani Paradise

55
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,867
5 biriyani parcels are ready

56
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:36,474
- Sir...bill
- l did not ask forthe bill

57
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,880
The bill is the only item
given here without asking

58
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,279
Do you know who l am?

59
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,449
No, may be someone out there
might know, but accept the bill first

60
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,193
He is the Counsilor
of this ward Sebastian Kuzhiveli

61
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,820
Shortly will become
Municipal Chairman

62
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,492
He's a new recruit,
excuse him

63
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:59,299
What a fantastic biriyani
Sahib, the biriyani here is unbeatable

64
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,603
Tell me, is the mutton used in this
belong to meat of buffalo or ox?

65
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,864
To the elephant!!!

66
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,208
Kuzhiveli, the secret
of our biriyani is...

67
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:11,113
...the tender meat of
goat less than 6 months old

68
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,548
Along with it
the Lords mercy too

69
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,884
Each time biriyani is cooked
there are butterflies in my stomach

70
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,857
l just close my eyes
and call out Almighty my Lord'!

71
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,892
A small error and my business
is finished forever isn't it?

72
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:27,557
Look at that hotel
What a flourishing place it was!

73
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,336
A bit of carelessness
Served old food, resulted in poisoning

74
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,339
Municipality ordered it to be shut down
and applied seal on it, isn't it?

75
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,237
Yes indeed!

76
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:41,205
Don't forget the past, dear Sahib
Do you remember my efforts to get it sealed?

77
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,979
l have bought you a brand new
Maruthi car in return, don't forget that

78
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,152
Where is your car?

79
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,122
lts parked almost a kilometer away
You don't have parking facility here, right?

80
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,319
Now-a-days parking
facility is a must

81
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,228
That Thirumeni's place
will accommodate 30 vehicles

82
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,596
lt's really a pity
you are unable to buy so far

83
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,464
That Thirumeni refuses
to part with it

84
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,298
l have asked a hundred times
But he doesn't budge

85
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,970
He will come around one day

86
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:16,044
l had a specific motive when l lent him
Rs 10 lakhs for his daughter's wedding

87
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,084
l consider it as an amount
paid in advance forthis property

88
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,913
Thirumeni's younger
daughter's wedding is also fixed

89
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:26,448
How can he bear the expenses
without selling this property?

90
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,896
Why don't you go try
to clinch a deal for me?

91
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,023
ln place of your Maruthi,
l'll see that a Benz stands

92
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,129
Benz car!

93
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,289
- Namasthey!
- What brings you here, Kuzhiveli?

94
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:07,461
Well, there's a wedding in your house
As counsilor, l thought l'll just enquire

95
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:13,961
Why? Has the government arranged
to give financial assistance for weddings?

96
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,201
lf you only make up your mind
is it so difficult to raise funds?

97
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,942
What l am trying to say is...

98
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,413
Don't bother, l understand
what you are getting at

99
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:27,976
lts true that circumstances forced
me to shut down my hotel

100
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:33,616
But l will not give it up to followers
of another religion to cook his meat

101
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,626
l will not have fish and meat
anywhere in the vicinity of my place

102
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,029
The temple pond you have your daily dip
Doesn't it have fish in it?

103
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:40,655
Yes of course

104
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,327
You can use water from ponds
and rivers with live fish and...

105
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:48,237
...use milk from cows which is
a part of theirflesh and blood

106
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,207
But that does not affect your sense
of sanctity and cleanliness, right?

107
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:55,714
- Hey Nair?
- Yes sir?.

108
00:11:56,148 --> 00:12:00,585
- Throw this dirty fellow out
- Not necessary, l will go

109
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:04,089
But remember, don't
cross swords with Sulaiman Sahib

110
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,684
He has helped you with Rs 10 lakhs
for your elder daughter's wedding

111
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,622
You did not think touching his money
was sacrilege then

112
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,597
He has not asked you
to return that money...

113
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,260
...because he intends
to own your property one day

114
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,360
l am going now

115
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,135
But l will see you
if your daughter gets married...

116
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,574
...even if l am not invited!

117
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,506
Did you hear
his underlying threat, Nair?

118
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,639
My daughter's marriage
won't take place it seems

119
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,683
The whole town knows
l don't have money

120
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,220
Lord! What more should l hear!

121
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:39,815
Frankly, what does it matter
who buys the place?

122
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,390
lsn't it enough if you
get a good price?

123
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,226
Have you also forgotten
the idol of baby Ganapathy there?

124
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:50,633
l have performed puja to that idol
ever since l can remember

125
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:56,139
Just a clean-up and a lamp lit
HE will bless me whole heartedly

126
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,301
What will an alien religion
do with Lord Ganapathy?

127
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,071
Dad, come here

128
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,079
What is it my dear?

129
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,049
Dad, Devan sir's
e-mail has come

130
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,414
- ls it?
- What?

131
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:11,180
Mail, now-a-days this is what
takes the place of letter writing

132
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,523
Haven't l told you about a Kamath
who was her senior in college?

133
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,495
Oh! Kamath

134
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,264
What was his reply my dear?

135
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,266
l had written in detail
about our situation

136
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,165
He said he'll come
and meet us directly

137
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,270
Lord Vighneshwara!
You have saved us

138
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:32,067
Today, in whole of
Kerala, they own big hotels

139
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,339
This Kamath and
his brother Kamath

140
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,744
Proprietors
Kamath and Kamath

141
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,477
lf they take over
our hotel we are saved

142
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,760
Who are you?
What do you want?

143
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,460
Sulaiman Sahib sent us here

144
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,593
He has asked you
to sign this agreement

145
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,864
What is it?
Appears to be in English

146
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,770
Give it to me father
Let me read it

147
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,768
This is a lease agreement
for our hotel and land

148
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,279
lt shows an advance
received for Rs 10 lakhs

149
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,516
lt is true that
l owe Sahib Rs 10 lakhs

150
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,382
But l don't understand
this agreement

151
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,514
ls it right to accept money
and not sign an agreement?

152
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,184
lf you don't sign
we may have to use force

153
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,850
Well, l'd like to see you do that!

154
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,691
- Then come here!
- No! Don't!

155
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,938
Lord Venkatpathy!

156
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,717
What are 'we' seeing here?
A thrashing session!?

157
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,757
All that is of no use
We can always talk things over

158
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:26,654
Who are you?

159
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,217
We? l am 'we'
Don't you understand?

160
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,490
Didn't 'we' just arrive
by car now?

161
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,534
'We' means, son of
Krishnarajakudi Kamath...

162
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,797
...Devaraja Kamath

163
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,601
Now you?,
Tell me what is the issue?

164
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,508
- We are Sulaiman Sahib's men
- ls that the issue?

165
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,475
No!

166
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:51,678
Don't botherto explain
l have understood the situation

167
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,911
lt's a problem of Rs 10 lakhs right?
'We' will pay you that money

168
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,850
Murthy?

169
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,429
Fold that umbrella, Murthy! Useless!

170
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:10,992
How long since
you borrowed this money?

171
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,537
About a year and half

172
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:17,371
Let them calculate
rate of interest for 2 years

173
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:26,384
That makes it
Rs 1209999.85

174
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:32,721
Murthy we round it up to 1210000
You get 15 paisa more

175
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,450
We spend so much on trivialities
Let them go eat it

176
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,426
Murthy!

177
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:43,260
Don't shake, the table is wobbling
Without shaking!

178
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,662
You can go give this to Sahib

179
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,333
We came to get the agreement signed
You better do what we ask, Thirumeni

180
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,898
Thirumeni will not do it

181
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,807
- You don't interfere
- Of course l will

182
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,310
l will interfere even more

183
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,745
Beat and drive him away
The stinker!

184
00:16:55,814 --> 00:17:00,046
Not stinker, its Kamath
DevarajaKamath

185
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,681
Don't beat me

186
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,451
We Kamaths are
fond of peace

187
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,924
Have no history of wars and
follow non violence

188
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:14,466
But if all of you insist
on a thrashing...Murthy?!

189
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:27,474
lf l just press this, your heads
will break and you will die

190
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:32,573
You will die but l won't go to jail
l have money and power

191
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:36,450
You can decide whether
you want your life or the agreement

192
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,456
We want our lives
Only our lives!

193
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,113
With the cash

194
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:48,128
Murthy please take their
names address and photo

195
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:52,536
lf we ever have a problem
never call them!

196
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,699
-All are cowards!
- Run for it!

197
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,979
Thirumeni, were you scared?
This does not have bullets

198
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,707
All the bullets are
with my brother Kamath

199
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,911
He refuses to give them to me

200
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,782
But he has only the bullets
No gun

201
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,956
The gun is with me right?

202
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,790
Only a bullet will allow
the gun to fire, right?

203
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,829
ln short we never fire guns!

204
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,764
Karthiyayini, give him
some buttermilk to drink

205
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,962
l want nothing

206
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,801
l just want to see
that place the property

207
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,910
My dear go with him

208
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,847
BlRlYANl STREET

209
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,547
Once we open our shop
within 3 months, this name will go

210
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,714
lt will become
Kamath & Kamath Street

211
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,382
That's the usual blessing

212
00:18:54,233 --> 00:19:01,036
Sree Krishna Vilasam
East facing...very auspicious

213
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,167
Lord Ganapathy
is the God installed, right?

214
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,505
ls that guy who is peeping
out of that counter, the Sahib?

215
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,139
Yes

216
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,785
Nice fair and an enemy
like a beautiful pudding

217
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,418
Come sir, don't you want
to see inside of the shop?

218
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,854
Sure let's go

219
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,667
Why are you staring like this?

220
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:41,610
- Your wedding has really been fixed right?
- Yes, but why?

221
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,145
l feel quite sad

222
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,780
You were once
like a broomstick

223
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,614
Now grown big, you look
like a lovely witch

224
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,987
lf l had known this l would have
declared my love for you...

225
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,548
...and blocked you for myself

226
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,592
Now it's of no use

227
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,561
-Anyways l like you very much
- What?

228
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,100
Not you!
lt has gone out of my hands

229
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,136
This property, good
that you thought of us...

230
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,935
...when you decided
to sell it

231
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:12,736
We'll take over
this place happily

232
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,819
That Kamath has
given you the works

233
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,584
How can his dosa and sambhar
compete with our biriyani?

234
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,757
lt can't happen

235
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:33,191
What are you saying Sahib?
This is their 33rd hotel

236
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:37,598
Wherever they start one, there is
a queue like in beverages shops

237
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,034
l myself fell for it once

238
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,164
l stood in the queue
and found it was Kamaths hotel

239
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:47,940
Kuzhiveli, l can't tolerate
another hotel in front of ours

240
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,047
Kamaths must not
open their hotel

241
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,184
Tell me a way to sabotage it
like you did for Thirumeni's hotel

242
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:03,724
The municipal secretary is not the same
Now it's a lady, Mahalakshmi

243
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,691
- You may have to shell out some money
-Allah! Does that lady accept bribe?

244
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:12,896
She will not, but l will
lt will be difficult to subdue her

245
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,139
She's a man-hater

246
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:19,336
People say she's frustrated
because she's spinster even now

247
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,612
Municipal office

248
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,241
Secretary

249
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:33,714
The guy who is sitting there
is Kamath, a womanizer

250
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,295
Don't talk, if you do, even
a secretary like you, will fall for him

251
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,061
The municipal secretary has come

252
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,025
He will try to persuade you
But don't give in

253
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,229
Greetings, l am Kamath

254
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,002
Devaraja Kamath, partner
of Kamath & Kamath Hotels

255
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,632
Should we stand
on our heads for that?

256
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,142
- You can stand
- Sure l will

257
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,376
Madam, its 3 days
since l have been...

258
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,812
...climbing up...climbing down
like this to meet you

259
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,643
But it appears you were on leave

260
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,711
When l heard Secretary
was a woman

261
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,086
l thought she'd be
in her early 50s

262
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,648
But so young!

263
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,317
Excuse me?

264
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,830
Which college are you studying in,
is what any one will ask

265
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,156
-Are you married?
- What if l am?

266
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,599
- What does your husband do?
- What should he do?

267
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,692
Children?

268
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,001
Children without getting married?
Madam he is insulting you

269
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,975
Oh Lord Venkatpathy
Aren't you married?

270
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,238
l too am not
Same pinch

271
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,907
He's mad!
You go inside madam

272
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,840
- Hey wait!
- What is your problem?

273
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,283
What about the license
for our hotel?

274
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,615
Have you taken
prior appointment?

275
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,016
No!

276
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:39,785
- Then you will have to wait
- But l was waiting all of morning

277
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,691
- Was l not right?
-About what?

278
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,253
That he's a womanizer?

279
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,664
He has an older brother,
Rajaraja Kamath

280
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,929
Rumors say he kicked
his wife to her death

281
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,335
So never issue them the license

282
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,806
Do we issue licenses
based on conduct certificate?

283
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:02,010
4-5 years back the Health dept
and Food corp...

284
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:07,381
...shut down and sealed
the old hotel Sree Krishna Vilas

285
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,786
Now they have changed
the name to Kamath & Kamath...

286
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,324
...and applied for license

287
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,189
The case is still pending
Madam, don't get into trouble

288
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:22,222
He is trying to get a license
without your knowledge from the Council

289
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,100
Can you take a step
without the council's approval?

290
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,228
You can't

291
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:31,967
So you have to bring it
to their notice

292
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,677
Let me look at that file

293
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,217
- Madam, it will soon be lunch break
- Who asked you to come in here?

294
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,075
Don't spit into my eyes

295
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:45,055
l don't have time to spare
Monday is the hotel inauguration

296
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,348
lnauguration without a license

297
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,223
lsn't that why
an application was given?

298
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,819
Yourfile needs thorough scrutiny
You can go and return next week

299
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:55,230
Please don't say that
We can't change the inaugural day

300
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,894
Who asked you to fix the day
without your license permitted?

301
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:02,303
My older brother Rajaraja Kamath
Madam, you would not know him

302
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,408
He looks like
our mega star Mammootty

303
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,241
And just like him
he is very short-tempered

304
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,042
lf he loves he is a Royal gem
lf you cross him he's the king of thugs

305
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,343
The rest of it
l am not willing to say

306
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,783
l have no orders
to issue the license

307
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:15,875
You may please leave now

308
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,416
So you will not
issue us the license eh?

309
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,114
No!

310
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,249
Just a minute, okay?

311
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,383
- Hey! Don't shoot
- This is a phone

312
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:30,830
Annu(brother)
they are not issuing the license

313
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,961
This is not Malayalam
lt is Urdu

314
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,068
He says shall he try hooking you
Don't mind all that

315
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:42,273
- Okay Annu(brother)
- Like a karate class!

316
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,007
That was my brother

317
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:47,813
He said ask that arrogant secretary
to go climb the wall!!!

318
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,514
He said just one snap of his fingers
and the municipal chairman...

319
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,217
...will come to the hotel premises
and issue the license

320
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,418
Do you know who are talking to?

321
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,560
- l told brother about you also
-And what did he say?

322
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,095
He asked me not to deal with you,
lt was an order

323
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,368
- He said to keep you aside
- Why?

324
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,996
So that he'll have the pleasure
of thrashing you all by himself

325
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,266
Thrashing me!

326
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:14,768
So the day has been fixed for Monday
And the 1st invite is for you madam

327
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,008
You have to come,
participate and bless us

328
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,475
We are specially
not inviting you at all

329
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,519
- Don't come
- No, l wont!

330
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,156
Did you see him madam?
His arrogance

331
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:29,421
l want to see how he will
inaugurate this hotel without a license

332
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:38,265
Kamaths are inaugurating it
challenging municipality orders

333
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,867
But Municipal secretary
is very stubborn

334
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:45,273
Although a woman, she appears to be fiery
The police will stop this event

335
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,310
Did you see that board?

336
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:52,078
One Kamath is green
and the other is red

337
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,616
The red one is dangerous

338
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,215
They must be having
something up their sleeve

339
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,882
On the day of inauguration
if the older Kamath does not arrive...

340
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,391
...we can be sure it won't take place

341
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,453
l will see to it he does not
step into this Palakkad district

342
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,299
Kamath will be punched
and broken into bits...

343
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:15,203
...and admitted in hospital
by my smart boys, Sahib

344
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,305
Let him come
This Rajaraja Kamath!

345
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,878
- ls Rajaraja Kamath inside the vehicle
- What if he is?

346
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,107
-Ask him to come out!
- Why must he, l wonder?.!

347
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,045
To give him some of our affection

348
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,414
Oh is it? lt's been ages
since the body had some exercise

349
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,577
l'll call him right away

350
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,351
Boss!

351
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:54,338
Okay, so who are all of you?
l have no clue

352
00:27:55,206 --> 00:28:00,337
Lord! What's this an array of knives?
You have come to thrash us, right?

353
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:00,969
Yes

354
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,274
So we have enemies in Palakkad

355
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,045
You have come to beat us
but we generally don't beat up thugs

356
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:13,614
For that we feed meat of goat
ox, fowl, tiger etc and maintain a buffalo

357
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,556
Do you want to know who he is?

358
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,457
- Who?
- Who else can it be?

359
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,688
This is him
His name is Gopi

360
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:22,995
He delivers very good punches
Try him, it's a good chance

361
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,429
Gopi, just beat them
but don't kill okay

362
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,109
Gopi, come on start!

363
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,667
Get up and come here

364
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,866
What did you think?

365
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,734
That if you defeat him you can come
and fight with me? Foolish fellow

366
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,401
Forget that desire

367
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,308
l don't use my fists on such
cheap and stupid fellows

368
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,540
Okay, now tell me who sent you here?
Come on simply tell me l say!

369
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:21,777
Out with it you...!

370
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,624
- Greetings
- Please come

371
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:42,870
Hello...check...hello

372
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:48,306
For accepting our invite my brother
and l extend a hearty welcome to...

373
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:56,218
...the Municipal Secretary,
Chairman and all policemen

374
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,481
lnspector!

375
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,558
You can't open a hotel
without a Municipal license

376
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,752
You have broken the law
so a case will be charged

377
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,658
Who has broken the law here?

378
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:10,595
ls a license necessary to inaugurate
a place at an auspicious moment?

379
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,138
No my dear policemen
You can accuse us...

380
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,231
...of breaking law
only if we cook and sell food

381
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:21,574
We have not done that
So under which section are we charged?

382
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,513
Tell me policemen
Hey! Ask him to explain

383
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,675
Don't teach policemen law and sections

384
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:30,584
This hotel which was under
municipal seal was reopened...

385
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,782
...so, Thirumeni has to be arrested first

386
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:33,924
Get into thejeep

387
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:37,359
- But what crime did l commit?
- We can decide all that at the station

388
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,693
But that will not do sir
lt has to b e decided here

389
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:47,465
This property is now in our names
We changed ownership at the municipality

390
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,367
- You Kazhuveli(swear word)...!
- Not Kazhveli...l am Kuzhiveli

391
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,877
Whatever Vayyaveli(headache) you may be
You can also examine it, if you want

392
00:31:54,479 --> 00:32:00,418
Accepting money and harassing
people is bad, isn't it policeman?

393
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,452
What will you do if l did?

394
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,545
Just try it
l will flatten you like a dosa

395
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,749
You dare insult policemen

396
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:23,938
One minute!

397
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:32,839
All who've been waiting to see my brother
Rajaraja Kamath, he has just arrived

398
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,952
My humble greetings
to all townsfolk here

399
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:41,217
An unexpected attack the minute
l stepped into Palakkad district

400
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:46,656
Anyone will react when provoked
So l also reacted in a small way

401
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:47,958
Gopi!

402
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,965
Brother, who are these fellows?

403
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:56,438
Brother, l bet you didn't
touch them, right?

404
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,940
How did you know that?

405
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:02,673
They wouldn't be here alive
Won't they be dead by now? Dead!!!

406
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,712
Gopi?

407
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,849
What were their names?
The ones who sent these thugs?

408
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,944
Sulaiman sahib and Kuzhiveli

409
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:16,558
lf these gentlemen are here
please come forward

410
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,629
These guys need a lot of money
to treat their injuries

411
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,959
Please come forward one by one

412
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,501
Hey come here
Come and get them l say!

413
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,400
- Who is this Kuzhiveli?
- Look there, that's him

414
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,528
Sir!

415
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,629
Don't come to me
Keep away!

416
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,696
Sir

417
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:40,741
Hey! All policemen too are here
for the opening, we're so fortunate

418
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,844
Not only policemen
Municipality members too

419
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,516
He is the Municipal Chairman
She is the secretary, Mahalakshmi

420
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,459
She looks like her namesake
Goddess Mahalakshmi

421
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,622
But her heart is like Kali(violent)
Goddess Bhadrakali

422
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,327
My dear Bhadrakali...
l'm sorry secretary sir

423
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,537
We are not stupid to open
a hotel without license

424
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,735
You have not issued us a license
There is a Council above you

425
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,940
There is a section to issue it
Above that there is the court

426
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,678
What did you think of us?
This Kamaths' is big enterprise

427
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,014
Lord Venkatpathi!

428
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:21,619
You must realize, there's not a single
MLA, MP or Panchayath president...

429
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,456
...who has not tasted our Dosa

430
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,526
We met the Minister
and he issued us the license

431
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,532
This is the license and a copy
has been sent to your office

432
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,727
You can look at it
Look! Look! Properly!

433
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,772
Look at it closely
Lovely like a paper roast dosa!

434
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,701
Brother! The auspicious
moment is passing

435
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,970
We shall perform
the inauguration immediately

436
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:40,770

Greetings, good that you have
opened a branch here also

443
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,416
l'd forgotten the taste of your dosa
since my transferfrom Trivandrum

444
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:24,618
Do you know, my wife and kids
simply love their masala dosa?!

445
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,815
We are indeed fortunate

446

Sorry! Dy SP George will

00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,842
Nothing like a competition, right?

lf a policeman is afraid of a thief
then don't accept the challenge

470
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,092
This is shameful sir

471
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,102
There is no police or
robber in a challenge

472
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,036

Sir, it wasn't like that
lt was Kamath who threw the stone

577
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,058
First ask this guy

Why have you put him here?

593
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:37,487
We were forced to arrest him
For illegal sale of liquor

594

Come! Come!

Move aside

00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,537
Constable! Search the place

599
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,475
Oh Lord Venkatpathy!

00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,614
No sir, we bought this here
And paid double the price for it!

00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,619
How dare you lie, you drunkards!

Policemen! We have not sold liquor here

00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,427
Sir, don't push!

612

Attacked the municipal secretary's house
Accomplice is thief Pathrose

614
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,141
This is great!

615
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,312
Tomorrow the papers
can carry this juicy news

616
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,677
Let the Kamath pair be locked up here

617
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,514
Rajashekhar, pick one out of
the 'evidences' and place it inside

618
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:42,191
lf l have to deal with the Kamaths
l have to have drink a couple of pegs

619
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:50,460
Hey you! lf either of my boss is touched
l'll kill you and your entire family

620
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:56,164
To me earth is home and sky the roof
Whether l am outside or in central jail

621
00:47:56,773 --> 00:48:00,368
lt was around 10 at night
my house was attacked

622
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,640
Thief Pathrose has given
a statement in support

623
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:07,774
The fact that illegal sale
of liquor occurred...

624
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,217
...in my ward makes me feel ashamed

625
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,916
As president of Hotels association
What do you have to say?

626
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,725
This is a matter of shame for all of us

627
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,921
Our Association has
decided that the other...

628
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:23,189
...Kamath hotels too
have to be shut down, right?

629
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,863
What is the charge
against the Kamaths?

630
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,940
Sir, this is the charge sheet

631
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,736
- Kamath?
- Greetings

632
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,437

633
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:40,978
Our greetings

634
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,689
What's all this guys?
l can't stand by you in such cases

635
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,814
Sir, please don't say that

636
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,894
We Kamaths are
Gowda Saraswath Brahmins

637
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,758
We neither utter lies nor sell liquor

638
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,491
This is a trap

639
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,560
We don't go peeing over walls
Someone laid a trap and we fell in it

640
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,673
That may be true
But evidences are against you

641
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,606
The thief Pathrose is very
adamant in his statement

642
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:08,973
He is a cunning thief

643
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,409
You just have to roll your eyes
and he'll come out with the truth

644
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:16,008
Just give him the works sir
He'll tell the truth

645
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,012
Go!

646
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,384
-Aren't you a true Christian?
- No, l am thief Pathrose

647
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:29,295
lf you don't tell me the truth
you'll go to hell

648
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,566
Tell me honestly, who threw
the stone at the secretary's house?

649
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,432
- This Kamath, sir
- Did you hear that?

650
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,869
Oh God Venkatpathy!

651
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,238
Aren't you a Dy SP?
ls this how you interrogate robbers?

652
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:42,710
They will never own up like this
There are other means for this

653
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,940
lt's better you tell the truth

654
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,883
Otherwise your brain will scatter

655
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,681
Don't wait, just do it
Look at him and his bald head!

656
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,483
lf l shoot, you'll have
to walk about without a head

657
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,820
Hey stop it
l'll lose my job

658
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:58,656
Stop it! Don't beat me
l'll tell you everything

659
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,593
This fellow is more scared
of punches than a gun shot

660
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,530
- l'll flog you death
- No! l'll tell you the whole truth

661
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,033
Sir, give me your phone

662
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,965
Oh you are going to shoot, eh?
Let me spruce up myself

663
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,801
Who sent you here?

664
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,672
Just blurt it out like a parrot,
it will be great

665
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:20,441
- Sulaiman sahib paid money and he..
- What is all this?

666
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,552
- You asked me to say it like a parrot
- Oh Lord Venkatpathi

667
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:25,712
- Who threw the stone?
- Okay l'll tell everything

668
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,849
To help Sulaiman Sahib
Councilor Kuzhiveli sir paid me

669
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:32,895
l was asked to hang around
and wait till the police came

670
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:36,626
And when the police get me
to say Kamaths name

671
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,497
l waited near the secretary's
house for 3-4 days...

672
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,504
...to get the attention of
Kamath sir, l swear

673
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:45,598
- He is a sensible thief
- Continue l say!

674
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:51,875
l will fight forjustice against this
atrocity in a house where only women lived

675
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:55,076
Sorry, madam
The case has taken a new angle

676
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,420
This is thief Pathrose
stating the truth

677
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,649
lt was l who threw the stone
l did it

678
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:05,785
For Sulaiman sir
Councillor Kuzhiveli sir paid me

679
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:12,961
He asked me to wait there
and tell Kamaths name when questioned

680
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,800
Now do you realize
who threw the stone?

681
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:26,644
Honorable Councillor and Sulaiman sir
Please come forward

682
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,581
We have something to show you

683
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,620
Gopi!
Bring it here

684
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:38,354
These are scenes of CCTV cameras
of our hotel that record events 24 hours

685
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:42,896
Show it to them
lsn't this proof?.

686
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:51,839
This is from the camera outside
There are cameras inside also

687
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,789
Gopi! Wait

688
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,929
Don't, they will be
taken care of by the policemen

689
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,994
l have reserved some for you also

690
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,037
Secretary madam,
l have something to tell you

691
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,038
l have no enmity towards you

692
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,879
lf l did, l'd have clapped happily
when he threw the stone

693
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,750
lt was my mother
who asked me to help you

694
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:42,154
When the police took us away
There were tears in her eyes

695
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:46,961
You are answerable to those tears
Not to me, but to God

696
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,962
You can go madam

697
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:05,637
Sulaiman sahib, what harm
did we do to you?

698
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:09,913
We have only dosa, idly
and sambhar in our menu

699
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:15,218
But you Muslims
you have a variety of food

700
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:20,156
Biriyani, ghee rice, Pathiri,
mutton curry and so many more

701
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:23,027
No other community can claim them

702
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:29,834
People of other communities crowd
into lslam hotels that are run honestly

703
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,137
They do come willingly
and you know it very well

704
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:39,180
Let people who eat biriyani for 10 days
eat dosa for one day, just for a change

705
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,683
Sahib, your Thalassery biriyani
will not match our dosa, isn't it?

706
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,613
Moreover, Thirumeni refused
to sell that property to you...

707
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:49,055
...not out of enmity but the presence
of the ldol of Lord Ganapathy

708
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,561
He believes other religions
will not give it due respect,...

709
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:55,028
...so he preferred selling it to us

710
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,962
lsn't that correct?
He's a simple man

711
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:03,767
lf you had asked us space
to park vehicles for your customers...

712
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,034
...we would have given it

713
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,268
But did you ask?
No

714
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,671
Even after harassing us
we are still ready to offer...

715
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:14,238
...our place for your customers
to park their vehicles

716
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:19,015
Let people then decide whether
they want to eat biriyani or dosa

717
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,716
Your ancestors once
gave us refuge in this land

718
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:26,227
We only have one request
Don't hate us

719
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,657
l forgot to mention this
We'll be gone from here for 2 days

720
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,736
Forthe inauguration
of our new hotel at Coimbatore

721
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,067
Please see our hotel
does not run into troubles

722
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,004
ln the name of Almighty
don't talk like this

723
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,099
l realize my mistake

724
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:45,011
You can go with a free mind
l will look after it like my own hotel

725
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,209
ls the Coimbatore hotel also
to be opened by 2 of you?

726
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:53,085
No! Of course not!
We will have a celebration in Tamil Nadu

727
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:56,182
The inauguration there
will be by a film star

728
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,157
Super star Danush

729
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:50,372
Thanks for coming

730
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,682
Please come

731
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,691
Greetings to everyone

732
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:15,965
My most beloved
and respected Sri Danush

733
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,832
Dear ladies
and gentlemen of Coimbatore

734
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,739
The inauguration of Kamath
and Kamath...

735
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,247
...super special dosa joint
is about to begin here

736
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:30,979
There's no Malayali who doesn't know
the wonderful taste of our dosas

737
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:34,716
We are bringing that taste
to Tamil Nadu also

738
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:38,351
Even if you have a hundred dosas
it will seem like you've had just one dosa

739
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,195
Very happy
lt's Tamil

740
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,923
But we gave it in Malayalam

741
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,660
That's because you are
speaking in Malayalam

742
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:52,206
l am inviting our super star
Dhanush sirto speak a few words

743
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,240
You can drop our names
every now and then

744
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,278
lt will sound great

745
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,916
You can give a boost in between

746
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,109
Come on talk

747
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:05,710
- Devaraj Kamath
- Greetings to one and all

748
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,216
Enough, enough

749
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,158
l am very happy to see you all here

750
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:16,959
l wish to thank
Kamath brothers and God

751
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,398
- DevarajKamath
- l will mention it, l will

752
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:26,200
lt's a matter of great happiness
a malayali opens a hotel in Tamil Nadu

753
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:29,073
Our Chief Minister once upon a time...

754
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,239
...and Hero among heroes
MGR too was a malayali

755
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,383
Likewise MN Nambiar
the most hated villain on screen

756
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,887
But a gem of a person
too was a malayali

757
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:45,450
Even Kamal sirthe pride of our state
also acted in a malayalam film first

758
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,398
The Kamath brothers' hotel
is very famous in Kerala

759
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:52,525
- Devaraj Kamath
- l will say it

760
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,867
The Kamath brothers' hotel
is very famous in Kerala

761
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,768
Rajaraja Kamath

762
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,968
Like Thalapkattu biryani,
Thirunelveli halwa

763
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,408
Or like Nairs tea stall...

764
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:05,345
...Kamath brothers dosa too
will become famous

765
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:10,381
Rajaraja Kamath
and Devaraja Kamath, okay?

766
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:15,281
My prayers that their hotel
is a big success

767
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:20,024
Kamath sir, l have a desire
That is to act in a Malayalam movie

768
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:25,034
lf you have friends
in the cinema field please tell them

769
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,396
Why don't we try?

770
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:31,339
The time is good
Let's begin the inauguration ritual

771
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:34,543
Scissors?

772
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:40,010
Here we are not doing it with scissors
But by making a dosa

773
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:43,279
Murthy bring that dosa set up

774
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,364
Brother, 2 cherries here
Like a pair of eyes

775
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,367
Okay, here are the eyes

776
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,804
This is our Dhanush special dosa

777
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,502
- ls it because it's thin like me?
- lt's not like that

778
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:12,343
On sight it is thin but on eating it
the taste will be great, like you

779
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:14,383
We'll start singing the song, Kolaveri...

780
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,611
Kolaveri' kolaveri di

781
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,513
- l take leave
- Okay

782
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,887
Please go carefully

783
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:30,959
A man like ghee roast(dosa)
With insides like laddu(sweet)

784
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,914
Respected municipal secretary come out

785
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,387
- What the heck do you want?
- Get out first

786
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:02,989
l requested you something 3 years back
l can't wait any longer

787
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:04,426
Will you give up Surekha or not?

788
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,434
We have not kept her
under bondage

789
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,561
She is intelligent and educated
to take her own decision

790
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:11,402
You can't make such lame
excuses any more

791
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,203
l must know today a final decision

792
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,004
l will show you how Surekha
will come to my house

793
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,408
Put her into the vehicle guys

794
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:19,346
- Hey you can't behave so atrociously
- Who are you to ask?

795
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,041
Give it to him good and proper

796
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:28,446
Hey wait!
Stop right there

797
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,403
- Who is that?
- lsn't that our secretary?

798
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,439
And there are thugs after her also

799
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:48,304
- What happened madam?
- Please help me

800
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:54,244
No one will help you
l will take her or kill her

801
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,477
And if you resist, you also

802

01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,685
Who are you?
What is the matter?

804
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:10,421
By passers need not interfere
This is a family matter

805
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:13,000
lf its family it should be
inside the house not on roads

806
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:18,507
Moreover, whether friend or enemy
lf a person asks help, we give it

807
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,269
Thrash this fellow, guys!

808
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,202

Why do they want to kill?

You must have eaten at home

828
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:05,679
No

829
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:10,810
lf you don't mind, let's stop

So you don't mind, eh?

That will do

You have not yet ordered

01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,346
What a surprise!
How come you're here?

843
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,545
- Came to have dinner
- We are on our way to Tirupathi

844
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:21,418
He is Mr Raja, Rajaraja Kamath

845
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,249
You have not introduced him to me

846
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,886
Sorry! He is my husband
Telugu speaking person

847
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,790
- Greetings
- Hi

848
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:31,656
Who is this?
Your wife?

849
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:32,701
No, a friend

850
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:36,636
Oh sorry! See you Mr Kamath,
Bye, take care

851
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:38,865
- Wish you all the best
- Thank you

852
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:44,703
- Who were they?
- Who?

853
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,270
Those people we met
at the restaurant

854
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,146
- My wife
- What?!

855
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,242
My wife
She used to be my wife

856
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,354
- Now?
- Now she's not

857
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:54,614
Why did you part?

858
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:58,784
The Lord did not give me
enough patience and endurance

859
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:01,694
We had to break up so we parted
That's all

860
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,695
What are you staring for?

861
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,872
You are talking about
the divorce so casually

862
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,435
That's a long story

863
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:19,310
lt was with great difficulty
we became prosperous

864
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,509
We lived a very simple life

865
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:26,452
We were very happy
and loved each other very much

866
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:32,289
Radhika, that is my wife's name
Her parents are in London

867
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,488
She was educated there
and that's why...

868
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:37,930
...she could not get along
with our way of life

869
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:42,363
My mother loved her a lot

870
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:48,303
My dear, we don't wear
such clothes in ourfamily

871
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,676
l will decide what l wear
Nobody need interfere

872
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,271
- My dear!
- Get lost you old hag!

873
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:54,474
Nuisance

874
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:59,782
No one told me anything
Because they didn't want to upset me

875
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:04,784
One day we were returning
after a business trip from Kozhikode

876
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,793
Dad suffered a chest pain

877
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:08,795
Sumanthi!

878
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,758
What happened to you?

879
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:15,899
My dear, the boys' father
is suffering from chest pain

880
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,472
We have to take him
to the hospital right now

881
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:18,403
Please take the car out

882
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:21,271
Can't you see l have applied 'mehendi'?
Call a taxi from outside

883
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,846
That will take a long time, dear
Just wash your hands and come

884
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:24,574
That will take a long time, dear
Just wash your hands and come

885
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,671
Don't harass me
Go away

886
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:35,015
By the time a taxi came and
took him to hospital, everything was over

887
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:41,393
You were responsible
for our father's death

888
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,829
l am not a servant
in your house or a driver

889
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,423
And l'm not nurse maid
to your parents

890
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:48,503
lt would have been very convenient
if that old hag had died too

891
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:56,934
l gave her a good slap
And she broke the sacred wedding chain

892
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,881
l have not felt any regret
or loss after that

893
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,582
- Sorry
- For what?

894
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,386
lt's high time they reached

895
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,324
May be they have decided
to halt over at a hotel

896
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:15,830
Hey! My boss will not even look at a girl

897
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:18,423
-Anyway l will not sleep here alone
- What else can you do?

898
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,933
Oh look! They have reached

899
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,937
- Okay goodnight
- Goodnight

900
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:40,854
Why do you prepare
so many dishes?

901
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:46,351
A few ldlys sambhar and a chutney
isn't that more than enough?

902
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,131
Who prepared this?

903
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:53,863
Definitely not you, mother

904
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:57,598
Mother will never make
such tasteless food

905
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:06,110
This tea is totally
unpalatable, no taste at all

906
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:09,943
Maybe Gopi has made all this
Gopi?!

907
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,577
l only know to eat not to cook

908
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,589
But l'll tell you for sure, this food
has come from the enemy's camp

909
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:19,457
Enemy's camp?
What are you saying?

910
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:23,157
Have you gone nuts?
l'll eat at our hotel

911
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:29,530
Don't say anything more
Food was made by girls next door

912
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:30,798
Who?
Mahalakshmi?

913
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:32,897
Don't eat it
if you didn't like it

914
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:35,944
- Who says l didn't like it
- But you said so just now

915
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:38,706
l often say such things
to tease mother

916
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:41,442
l try to make mother
laugh now and then

917
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,916
Yes true! Boss told me
ajoke and l laughed...

918
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,511
...for 2 weeks and
1 more week remains

919
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,685
Ass-monkey! Go out

920
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,689
Mom has never allowed me
into the kitchen

921
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,763
So l am a little backward in cooking

922
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,491
But not backward in talking!

923
01:08:56,932 --> 01:09:00,060
No one can beat you brothers in that

924
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:04,002
Ass-monkey! Are you still here?
Vagabond!

925
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,197
Tell me when you are free

926
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,940
l'll teach you to cook,
it will be great fun

927
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,036
Okay, treat it as ajoke

928
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:14,014
Both of you sit and talk
l must leave, okay?

929
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:19,016
She wants to talk to you

930
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,850
What is the matter?

931
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,886
She is asking for some help

932
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,754
What help do you want, tell me

933
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:31,958
Can you come
with me to Coimbatore?

934
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,662
-As a bodyguard, eh?
- Not at all

935
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,939
My sister has a problem
and we need a man to solve it

936
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:46,970
We don't have many relatives
who would be able to help

937
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,951
Don't come if it's a problem for you

938
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,114
l'll come

939
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,464
The house is good

01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,129
No, it's for rent
Come in

941
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,837
She's my mother, Maheshwari

942

01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,732
Where is the sister

01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:41,825
She's just on her way
back from office

955
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,166

A super coffee will do

01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,039
What snacks shall l make?

All ready! You can come

966
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,264
So many dishes in such a short time?
Hats off to you!

967
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:13,893
People of Kerala
call me a lion in cooking

968
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:20,135
When your sister comes
don't tell her l prepared all these

969
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:24,645
Tell her you made them
You can take the credit

970
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,577
- Look, Rekha has come
- l will stand away

971
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,999
lt's very tasty, right?

972
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:52,103
To tell you the truth
lt was l who made all of it

973
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:56,172
Do you recognize me?
l am Rajaraja Kamath

974
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,872
She will not recognize you like that

975
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,949
He is the person your sister
said was SP Kamath

976
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,745
Who is SP Kamath?

977
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:06,116
Don't you know?
People call you SP Kamath

978
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:07,587
Self Praising Kamath

979
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:12,821
Oh! lf no one talks about me
l will do it myself, what's wrong in that?

980
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:16,831
Even if you call me
SP Kamath, l have no issues

981
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:17,899
Now eat it my dear girl

982
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,131
Take a dosa, a little chutney
and make it into little balls...

983
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,298
...and then eat them
lt will be delicious!

984
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:30,271
Now let us come to the matter
What is your sister's problem?

985
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:35,708
She is worried for some time
She is being shadowed

986
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:38,377
But nobody is seen
visibly following her

987
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:42,714
ln the bus, bus stop someone
is behind her all the time

988
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:45,726
That guy who waylaid you
on the highway

989
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,729
Was it forthis sister
he created that issue?

990
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,832
- Yes!
- Then have no doubts

991
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:55,130
lt's them for sure

992
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,761
Have you given a police complaint?

993
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:00,740
We did, but they appear
to have influence over the police

994
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,735
Who are they?
How are they related to you?

995
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:07,145
lf you find it difficult
to tell me, then don't tell

996
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,410
Hey! Stop there
Stop!

997
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:09,746
Gopi

998
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,882
lf l get my hands on you

999
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,148
- Gopi, what is it?
- Who is it?

1000
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,316
Some guy was hiding near the gate

1001
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:18,757
When l asked he replied
in Hindi and ran away

1002
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:21,159
He looks a little fishy

1003
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:29,202
Both of them are very scared

1004
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:32,468
There is no need to be scared
We can easily handle this

1005
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,141
We have a place
to stay in this city

1006
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,213
But is it right to leave
them alone here?

1007
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,440
lt's not at all right

1008
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:44,152
- lf you don't mind, you can use that room
- Boss you can sleep there

1009
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,414
- Gopi can sleep in my room
- Sure

1010
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:49,217
- What about you?
- l will sleep with mother

1011
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,259
Then l'll sleep in the car

1012
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:56,222
- Shall we go?
- First we'll plan our action

1013
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:59,300
When does this fellow
usually follow your sister?

1014
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,301
Wasn't it at the bus stop yesterday?

1015
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,300
On a bike wearing a helmet

1016
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:06,431
Let her go as usual to the bus stop

1017
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:09,306
We will follow about
30 ft behind, very quietly

1018
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,208
Okay sister! You go
walking as usual

1019
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:47,944
Gopi, this is him

1020
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,885
lf l handle him, he will die

1021
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:54,516
l want him alive
So you go

1022
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:55,950
Okay, boss

1023
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:09,393
Going after girls and
harassing them you rascal?!

1024
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,528
Kamath vs Kamath

1025
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:50,194
Deva! You!

1026
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:52,364
Brother, l...

1027
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:54,908
What the heck were you up to?

1028
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,040
-Answer me
- No! Please don't boss!

1029
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,576
You hit my brother

1030
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:04,176
l've not used even a broomstick on him
Today l hit him

1031
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:08,211
Brother you have to forgive me
l committed a mistake

1032
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:14,193
l did not come to kill
l just came to declare my love

1033
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:19,326
l like that girl

1034
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,294
Girls have to be brought up
with restraint and sense of honor

1035
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:25,203
They should have self respect

1036
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,140
lf they make eyes and entice boys...

1037
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:29,335
...they will come after you
What's wrong in that?

1038
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:30,706
Hey! Better talk with respect, okay?

1039
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:32,310
l know the kind of person you are...

1040
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,975
...l mean you don't know who l am
Teaching me manners eh?

1041
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,348
- Brother! Stop talking like this
- You stay out of this

1042
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,283
The great municipal secretary

1043
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,652
lf you governed your home
like you did the municipality,...

1044
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,122
...will she have become like this?

1045
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:43,714
You!

1046
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:47,155
lf your sister is important to you
My brother is for me

1047
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:49,730
Whatever the mistake he commits
l will forgive him

1048
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:53,593
- Brother!
- You be quiet!

1049
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:56,466
Didn't you know it was my brother...

1050
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:59,563
...who was going after
this rat tail sister of yours?

1051
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:03,610
You hid that fact and made me hit him
You tried to separate us

1052
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:06,078
l kicked him
You demoness

1053
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:10,340
lf ever l see you or yourfamily
anywhere near my house again...!

1054
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:12,647
You Kamath!
l trusted you!

1055
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:15,383
But you used your brother
as a bait to get even with me, right?

1056
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:17,118
Forthis you will suffer

1057
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:20,592
Yes! We will see
who is going to suffer

1058
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:21,685
Let us see

1059
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:23,424
- Come guys
- Come my girl

1060
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:04,337
Boss, give me also a massage

1061
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,373
l'll give you a good kick
that will kill you

1062
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:09,501
Do you see this?
These are marks of injury

1063
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,306
You and your punches

1064
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,506
l will have to massage him
for a month at least...

1065
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:16,379
...only these marks will go, poor thing!

1066
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,715
All this body pain is not a problem

1067
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:22,518
l am feeling bad
that you were insulted

1068
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,626
l shouldn't have hit you

1069
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:28,694
l feel so bad kicking you

1070
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:31,630
lt was not deliberate done brother

1071
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:34,566
lsn't it for the sake of
that Municipal secretary?

1072
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,465
What are you saying?
Have you gone mad?

1073
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,065
What language
are you speaking?

1074
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,474
- You didn't understand, right?
- No!

1075
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:45,138
Well, from childhood,
this is my condition...

1076
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:47,681
...Sheer gibberish
when l hear both of you talk

1077
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:52,083
Get lost, you ass monkey
This is between us brothers

1078
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:55,554
Don't poke your nose into this
Don't kill yourself inviting my kick okay?

1079
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:58,148
But l too got a taste of
his blows, right?

1080
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:01,354
Eats only vegetables, but his blows
painful like being hit by a hammer

1081
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:05,331
l still don't believe you were
the killer stalking that girl

1082
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:07,333
l am not a killer, brother

1083
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:11,600
lt is true l followed her
But doesn't a girl recognize...

1084
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:15,699
...whether a guy
follows her to kill or to love?

1085
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:20,578
This is the first time
l am going after a girl, l swear

1086
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:23,173
There are so many girls
in this world

1087
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:27,381
l am surprised
why you love only this one?

1088
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:32,654
There are so many
wonderful buildings all overthe world

1089
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:37,528
Yet, tell me, why is only
the Taj Mahal a world wonder?

1090
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,657
- Tell me l say
- l don't understand it myself

1091
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:43,829
Gopi! There are
so many kinds of meat

1092
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:46,703
Yet you like the taste of only beef, why?

1093
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,834
Hey! Now l understand

1094
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,504
- But does the buffalo know it?
- Definitely not

1095
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:56,409
So many girls come to our hotel

1096
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,851
But why did l
notice (throw up) only her?.

1097
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:02,253
Throw up! Sure if she had
you'd have been in trouble by now!

1098
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:03,689
You will die with my kick now

1099
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:08,559
Why did l note only her especially?

1100
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:10,358
- Why?
- You tell me

1101
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,626
- You tell us
- l will tell you

1102
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:35,287
Thank you, sister

1103
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,852
- Mom
- Thanks

1104
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:46,664
God bless you!
So beautiful

1105
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:53,204
l just wondered for a minute
lf l was that child l would get a kiss, hmm?

1106
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:07,346
What is all this?
Give it to me

1107
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:47,958
My first kiss
l am not going to give up

1108
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:04,676
You are malayali, right?

1109
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,550
Help!

1110
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,924
Did you see what happened here?

1111
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:32,006
What is he saying?

1112
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,836
Did you see those thugs?

1113
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,275
Husband and wife
both are dumb, eh?

1114
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:42,907
Go, go!

1115
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:51,321
Escaped pretending to be
dumb just like l did, eh?

1116
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:56,022
Thank me for giving you this idea
Don't go away like this, without saying it

1117
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:59,396
l will also come
On the way we can...

1118
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:16,840
May l come in?

1119
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:22,482
l have come to clear some
doubts, regarding love tax

1120
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:28,494
l was living, minding my business when
a girl made me fall and gave me a kiss

1121
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:30,564
Should l pay a service tax for this?

1122
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,966
lf l feel l want more such kisses
Will that tax carry interest?

1123
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:41,509
A lot of love has
accumulated in the heart

1124
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:47,070
lt grew and grew into
a spreading bower ofjasmine

1125
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:50,481
How much of a love growth tax
has to be paid forthis?

1126
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,681
l like you very much

1127
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:56,617
Shall l go to your house
and propose marriage ?

1128
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:59,023
How much protection tax has to be paid?

1129
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,755
Excuse me?
May l help you?

1130
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:04,764
No! No! No!
Only this girl can help me

1131
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:07,767
She is not answering
any of my questions

1132
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:10,531
l will answer your questions
Give me your file

1133
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:16,076
l will give this file only to her
She can answer me

1134
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:17,475
She will not talk my dearfellow

1135
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:18,511
l will make her talk

1136
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:20,706
Attender!
Please throw this guy out

1137
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,114
No one has to push me out
l know how to go

1138
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,954
- Does this carry interest?
- Hey you!

1139
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:32,751
Like this, in spite of many efforts
she never bothered

1140
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:36,524
l realized my looks
and style were old fashioned

1141
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:40,657
l changed over and became
a smart young man

1142
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:45,534
l thought l'll try once more
and that's when you saw me

1143
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,665
Why do we need
a woman between us?

1144
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:50,175
You for me and l for you
lsn't that enough?

1145
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:53,874
We are brothers
Shouldn't our lineage continue?

1146
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:55,915
Deva, we are enough for each other

1147
01:25:55,984 --> 01:26:00,580
Shouldn't we have children?
You don't have a wife forthat

1148
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:04,921
lf l also don't try, who will perform
the last rites when we die?

1149
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:05,788
l am there for you

1150
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,727
How will you be there?
Won't someone kill you by then, you tramp?

1151
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:11,128
No one else will
l myself will kill him now

1152
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:14,532
With his comic comments
between my serious sentiments

1153
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:18,135
Brother, l want her

1154
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:23,137
lf you love her so much, l will
beg forgiveness at that secretary's feet

1155
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:25,805
Beg at herfeet?
No definitely not!

1156
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,479
Your self respect
is more important to me

1157
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:32,143
l can't bear to see my brother
bow his head to any one

1158
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:35,711
From this moment onwards
l have no feelings for that girl

1159
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:37,518
l have decided
to forget everything

1160
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:42,688
There is no need to uphold
my honor by giving you pain

1161
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:43,957
Don't! Brother

1162
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:48,568
Your happiness is most important
l will go and beg forgiveness

1163
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,103
- Don't! Brother
- l will

1164
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,502
- Don't
- l will

1165
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:53,165
Stop it!
What's the issue now?

1166
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:57,267
You want to continue lineage and
the wealth remain in the family, right?

1167
01:26:57,512 --> 01:26:59,480
l am indebted to you
for all you have done for me

1168
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:02,141
Now l want to show my gratitude
So l will marry this girl

1169
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:05,481
You tramp, vagabond
l will kill you!

1170
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:23,262
What is all this Gopi'etta?

1171
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:25,028
We came with a marriage proposal

1172
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,676
l knew you would come
l will get dressed and come

1173
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,602
Goodness! ls she nuts?

1174
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:33,840
Hey you! What is all this?

1175
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:35,176
These are fruits

1176
01:27:35,283 --> 01:27:37,717
- l don't understand
- Which fruit do you...

1177
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:38,979
But why are you here?

1178
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,987
We have come with a proposal

1179
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,113
We?

1180
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,858
My boss has come
with a marriage proposal

1181
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:45,983
For whom?
Me?

1182
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:50,531
l have come to ask your sister's
hand in marriage for my brother

1183
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:56,267
This is not our Kamath tradition
This is Coimbatore style, how is it?

1184
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:59,272
We are not interested
Take all this and get out!

1185
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:01,171
But...
Didn't you understand?

1186
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,174
My dear!

1187
01:28:02,677 --> 01:28:05,043
Mother don't be upset

1188
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:08,638
Yesterday secretary madam
and l had a small tiff

1189
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:11,583
We have come in truce
with these sweets

1190
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:13,848
Please listen to
what l have to say

1191
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:20,083
My brother likes your daughter Rekha
very, very much

1192
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:21,354
Why don't you
agree to the proposal?

1193
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:22,824
l said we are not interested, didn't l?

1194
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:25,330
lt's not for you to say that
Rekha has to say it

1195
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,568
l don't have time
to waste talking to you

1196
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:29,569
l have to reach Palakkad
and she has to reach office

1197
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:31,969
- Rekha, go!
- Please listen to me

1198
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:35,372
My brother is not
a bad guy like you think

1199
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:39,102
Handsome from a good family,
and very good behavior

1200
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:44,947
No drinks, cigarette, snuff,
drugs or chew betel leaves

1201
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:48,682
He will be the greatest
good fortune, a treasure for you

1202
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:52,624
Remember, he's my brother
How could he be bad?!

1203
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:56,322
You brothers are amazing
You speak only good about yourselves

1204
01:28:56,431 --> 01:29:01,198
But others too must be convinced
We don't want your loafer brother

1205
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,199
- Should l interfere, boss?
- No!

1206
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:11,604
We Kamaths respect women very much

1207
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:15,205
Otherwise l would have
chopped up the tongue...

1208
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:17,807
...that called my brother
a loafer and put it in sambhar

1209
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:20,945
Are you threatening me?
No wonder your wife divorced you

1210
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:22,147
Stop it!

1211
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:26,317
You are frustrated and jealous
Because you did not marry on time

1212
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:28,725
- Talk with respect
- Why should l respect you?

1213
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:33,631
l challenge you, if he truly loves her
my brother will marry herfor sure

1214
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:35,965
Otherwise l will make him
Just you wait

1215
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:38,629
lt will never happen

1216
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:43,803
Never say never, within a month 30 days,
it will happen, l will make it happen!

1217
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:45,936
l take leave now!
Municipality madam!

1218
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:48,641
Adios, madam!

1219
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:57,051
Brother, what foolishness have you done?

1220
01:29:57,158 --> 01:30:01,993
How can l possibly marry a girl
from the enemy's camp in 30 days?

1221
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:08,329
When they talked ill about you
l lost complete control of myself

1222
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:12,031
Don't think of losing out in this
My honor is in your hands now

1223
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,734
My hands?
What can l do?

1224
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:16,070
You have to show your love

1225
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:20,671
l have been doing only that
ever since l met her, isn't it?

1226
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:23,979
You cannot go after her
like a chain snatcher on a bike

1227
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:24,483
That's true

1228
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:29,679
When a guy goes after a girl, she must
be able to see his love slowly unfolding

1229
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:30,724
How do you do that, boss?

1230
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:32,350
You don't have to know that
Stand away

1231
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,452
- Here's your tea
- Go roast it and eat it

1232
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:36,697
- Here drink your tea
- Go boil it and eat it

1233
01:30:36,798 --> 01:30:38,095
- Hey!
- Continue brother

1234
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:43,831
Why do people who visit
our hotel, come again and again?

1235
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:46,907
Because we take care and
give them food like each one prefers

1236
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:51,035
That's how you have to do it
Serve according to taste, that's love

1237
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:53,875
He's a great one
in such things with women!

1238
01:30:53,981 --> 01:30:55,107
How do you know that?

1239
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:57,980
Don't poke your nose in matters
not your concern, keep it elsewhere

1240
01:30:58,085 --> 01:31:03,318
How do we serve
love according to taste?

1241
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:05,924
- You have to sing a song
- Great!

1242
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:07,517
Me?
Sing a song?

1243
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:10,322
Love and singing
have a great connection

1244
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:12,865
- Sing a song
- But l don't know to sing

1245
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:15,265
l will teach you

1246
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:18,133
Just say what you want
to say and that will be a song

1247
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:19,001
Gopi?

1248
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:24,408
Get a harmonium, a little guitar
a violin and a few tablas

1249
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:25,809
Do you wish to make aviyal (a dish)?

1250
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:28,939
No, you ass-monkey
To woo her

1251
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:52,439
- How is it?
- lt's very cold here

1252
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,872
You are an ass without
aesthetic sense, go inside!

1253
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:59,772
Brother, but this is in Konkani
She understands only Malayalam

1254
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,816
Forthat you can sing
the same thing in Malayalam

1255
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:04,475
Just go ahead sing and impress
lt will be wonderful!

1256
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:07,213
lf l go after her and
sing like this she will sulk

1257
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:11,018
- Then sing 'don't sulk if l follow you'
- How?

1258
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:12,319
l will sing it and show you

1259
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:18,529
Don't be angry my giri

1260

Don't be angry my giri iF i come after you
Let my giancet not anger you my girl

1281
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:08,591
Boss! lt's a pity you didn't
return that slap

1282
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,665
Haven't you heard?
lt's a sin to lay hands on a 'nari' (woman)

1283
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,499
Mother, sister, wife
and lover are 'naris'

1284
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:19,129
All women are 'naris'
(nari also means shameless)

1285
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,470
l didn't know that
all women are shameless!

1286
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:23,702
l'm not referring to that 'nari'
you shameless fellow!

1287
01:36:23,844 --> 01:36:24,469
Then what?

1288
01:36:24,578 --> 01:36:26,341
'Nari' which means women
is what l meant

1289
01:36:26,413 --> 01:36:32,113
We have got so many slaps in life
Considerthis as one of them

1290
01:36:32,553 --> 01:36:34,350
Did it hurt?

1291
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:39,390
Mmm..but there was
a solace in that pain also

1292
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:41,686
A pain full of sweetness

1293
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:44,765
What! l have been slapped too
Why have l never felt such sweet pain?

1294
01:36:44,865 --> 01:36:47,663
There is indeed such a pain
We are talking about human beings

1295
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:48,860
You go ahead

1296
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:54,097
Brother, the guilt of this slap
will start haunting her now

1297
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:57,837
Slowly it will turn to love

1298
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:02,276
Now there's no time to go slowly
Our deadline ends today

1299
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:06,686
Why don't we ask for an extension?
15 days more

1300
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:10,518
Even if you get 15 months more
this is not going to happen

1301
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:13,454
You are very backward
in matters of women

1302
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:15,289
l am unable to forget

1303
01:37:15,396 --> 01:37:17,330
- There is a way out
- What is that?

1304
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:20,457
- lf l say it will you jump at me?
- No! Just say it

1305
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:22,536
- Promise?
- l swear!

1306
01:37:22,703 --> 01:37:24,500
l'll go abduct and bring her here

1307
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:27,438
- Gopi!
- No!

1308
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:30,576
Oh mother! That she-devil is coming here!

1309
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:36,883
Oh God! Why is she here?

1310
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,552
- Come in
- Come, sit

1311
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:41,882
Whose bright idea was
it to make her...

1312
01:37:41,956 --> 01:37:44,925
...fall head over heels in love
by singing songs?

1313
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:46,454
My brother's

1314
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:50,327
Music, direction, lyrics
and everything else

1315
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:51,830
- The song was good
- Thanks!

1316
01:37:51,899 --> 01:37:53,594
But the idea failed!

1317
01:37:53,801 --> 01:37:56,736
Why don't we use Ananda Bhairavi
lt will be really good

1318
01:37:56,837 --> 01:37:58,896
l am not ready
for anything hereafter

1319
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:00,941
Shall l get you some tea?

1320
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:02,938
- Are you all slightly mad?
- Then l'll get you coffee

1321
01:38:03,177 --> 01:38:05,668
Don't you see madam is hot?
Give her something cool

1322
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:08,407
- l'll get some ice from the fridge
- You can keep it on your head

1323
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:09,140
You tell, Madam

1324
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,946
What happened to your
challenge of a wedding in 30 days?

1325
01:38:12,186 --> 01:38:15,587
l drew that challenge when l saw
his deep desire to marry your sister

1326
01:38:15,756 --> 01:38:18,623
We lost and you have won
We give up

1327
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:22,522
Can't you compromise
and give her to us?

1328
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:24,928
Please don't say no
He loves her so much

1329
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:26,689
- For whom?
- For him

1330
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:30,497
Can we not forget obstinacy and enmity
and allow this wedding to happen?

1331
01:38:30,938 --> 01:38:32,929
He will look after her like a treasure

1332
01:38:33,007 --> 01:38:35,407
lf wealth is not enough
l will give mine also

1333
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:37,806
She will never ever have
reason for remorse

1334
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:39,846
Rekha is not the girl you think she is

1335
01:38:39,947 --> 01:38:41,881
What?! Not a girl?
Brother!

1336
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:43,950
l don't know how to explain this

1337
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:46,350
May be Konkani will help
They understand that better

1338
01:38:46,453 --> 01:38:48,284
- Do you know Konkani?
- Gopi!

1339
01:38:48,889 --> 01:38:52,689
- You don't know anything about her
- Whatever we know is sufficient

1340
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:53,987
Do you know her caste?

1341
01:38:54,895 --> 01:38:57,796
Even if she is lower, she's a Hindu right?
That's enough

1342
01:38:58,332 --> 01:39:00,197
She's not a Hindu

1343
01:39:01,902 --> 01:39:03,199
She's a Christian

1344
01:39:07,474 --> 01:39:10,875
l have only a brother to call my own

1345
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:15,745
Before you know about her
You should know about my brother

1346
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:27,556
l'll be right there
l'll tell them sir

1347
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:32,323
Sir, what are you doing here?
The person l was talking about is on TV

1348
01:39:32,433 --> 01:39:35,561
Come
Have you started selling frogs?

1349
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:36,636
Where?

1350
01:39:37,571 --> 01:39:39,004
Switch on the TV

1351
01:39:39,573 --> 01:39:43,009
Sister, ask Lakshmi to come here

1352
01:39:43,277 --> 01:39:46,804
My dear look at the TV
Don't complain you didn't see the boy

1353
01:39:47,047 --> 01:39:50,483
- Hey! Shift to Manorama Channel
- Why didn't you say this earlier?

1354
01:39:54,955 --> 01:39:56,889
The guy l mentioned will appear now

1355
01:39:57,057 --> 01:39:59,924
He is a judge for this program
He's a lecturer

1356
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:01,892
The one with the blue shirt
Oh he's gone

1357
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:03,654
lt will come again

1358
01:40:03,764 --> 01:40:07,928
He was all the while watching
that girl who was dancing

1359
01:40:10,304 --> 01:40:12,898
- How is the boy, is he okay?
- l didn't see him

1360
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:15,899
- Suresh sir didn't you see him
- Sure very good

1361
01:40:17,544 --> 01:40:19,535
- What is her name?
- What?

1362
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:22,710
The girl who danced
Superb performance

1363
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:25,077
l am thinking of proposing
lt will be a good match

1364
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:28,879
Let your sister's alliance proceed first
Tomorrow the boy will come to meet her

1365
01:40:29,823 --> 01:40:31,814
Greetings!
Meet Krishnakumar

1366
01:40:31,925 --> 01:40:33,051

1367
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:35,724
- Please sit
- Thank you

1368
01:40:37,064 --> 01:40:39,658
Sister
Call her here

1369
01:40:54,014 --> 01:40:57,381
Nanu, find an auspicious date
l am sure this alliance is as good as fixed

1370
01:40:57,618 --> 01:40:58,676
l undertake all responsibility!

1371
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:01,747
lt was with regard to an income tax raid

1372
01:41:01,855 --> 01:41:04,119
Suresh first went to Malikapura House

1373
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:20,106
We are from the income tax department
We have to search this house

1374
01:41:20,874 --> 01:41:23,604
Malikapuram house does not have
unaccounted wealth...

1375
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:25,041
...you've been misinformed

1376
01:41:25,145 --> 01:41:27,636
ln any case we were misled
Let's know the truth and leave

1377
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:29,045
Call the Minister

1378
01:41:31,452 --> 01:41:35,115
Don't worry, all your establishments
are being raided at the same time

1379
01:41:37,191 --> 01:41:38,123
Come on search

1380
01:41:38,392 --> 01:41:41,623

01:41:45,165 --> 01:41:47,497

Who are you?

1383
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:20,998
Who is this?

1384
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:22,432
My aunt
Why?

1385
01:42:22,536 --> 01:42:24,731
- Where is she now?

Won't you tpeak to me with your eyet,

1416
01:46:19,005 --> 01:46:26,741
My son when l came to know
you loved my girl whole heartedly

1417
01:46:26,847 --> 01:46:31,079
l wanted to meet you
and talk to you

1418
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:35,814
That's why l sent word
when no one was here

1419
01:46:36,823 --> 01:46:39,917
My little one is expressing
a desire for 1st time

1420
01:46:40,093 --> 01:46:43,426
So l am not considering
caste or religion

1421
01:46:44,164 --> 01:46:48,760
She has neither a mom nor dad
You should look after her very well

1422
01:46:49,803 --> 01:46:56,140
lf her brothers come to know of this
They are evil and won't spare your life

1423
01:46:56,243 --> 01:46:57,676
Don't worry about that grand ma

1424
01:46:57,744 --> 01:47:03,683
As a precaution why don't you
marry herfirst in the registry office?

1425
01:47:04,317 --> 01:47:08,185
You can take her home
after your sister's marriage

1426
01:47:10,123 --> 01:47:15,060
Whiriing Fan, my toaring kite
you are oniy mine

1427
01:47:15,162 --> 01:47:19,929
Won't you tpeak to me with your eyet,
teii me you iike me

1428
01:47:20,033 --> 01:47:24,936
Whiriing Fan, my toaring kite
you are oniy mine

1429
01:47:25,005 --> 01:47:29,499
Won't you tpeak to me with your eyet,
teii me you iike me

1430
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:34,440
Why do you twing
in rhythm to whatever i tay?

1431
01:47:34,514 --> 01:47:39,747
Adorning me around with Fiowert,
branches to tender

1432
01:47:39,853 --> 01:47:44,756
Whiriing Fan, my toaring kite
you are oniy mine

1433
01:47:44,858 --> 01:47:49,818
Won't you tpeak to me with your eyet,
teii me you iike me

1434
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,098
Where is Suresh?

1435
01:48:02,008 --> 01:48:03,999
He's not here
Who are you?

1436
01:48:04,177 --> 01:48:08,443
Suresh is in love with our sister
Ask him to forget it

1437
01:48:11,351 --> 01:48:14,343
lf our family faces
a bad name because of him

1438
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,388
None of you will see him alive

1439
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:19,789
Are you threatening us?
Police and courts do exist here

1440
01:48:22,295 --> 01:48:24,763
This one is quite smart, Tomy'cha

1441
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:30,392
When you give the complaint
include this also in it

1442
01:48:31,471 --> 01:48:32,438
Come

1443
01:48:47,888 --> 01:48:49,446
What is your business here?

1444
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:54,926
Because of my love for your sister
Sunny'chan and Tommy'chan...

1445
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:57,121
...went to my house and
misbehaved with my sister

1446
01:48:57,531 --> 01:48:59,089
Have you come
to enquire about that?

1447
01:48:59,499 --> 01:49:01,831
Of course! Shouldn't l?

1448
01:49:01,968 --> 01:49:07,565
l can consider this is a drama of love
by her brothers towards a sister...

1449
01:49:08,008 --> 01:49:13,105
...who is worth in millions, controlling
and not even getting her married

1450
01:49:13,413 --> 01:49:18,282
But how can l excuse you
for slapping my sister?

1451
01:49:18,652 --> 01:49:25,490
l can't and if l don't return it, l'm not
eligible to call myself her brother

1452
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:26,923
Da!

1453
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:43,169
l am taking her away with me
As per law she is my wife

1454
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:46,274
Here is the copy of the certificate
of our registered marriage

1455
01:49:46,379 --> 01:49:47,937
When you have time go through it

1456
01:49:48,081 --> 01:49:53,519
l don't want your wealth or assets
But l want her

1457
01:49:55,322 --> 01:49:57,051
Grandma, please bless us

1458
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:02,420
Stop!

1459
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:06,160
Did you think you can put up
a show at Malikapuram house...

1460
01:50:06,299 --> 01:50:08,529
...and walk out alive with our sister?

1461
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:14,632
They are here for my protection
And my friends also have come

1462
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:24,239
Sunnycha, if she wants let her go
Don't stop them

1463
01:50:26,186 --> 01:50:30,213
Go my dear
Go live happily

1464
01:50:46,606 --> 01:50:48,198
Come in my dear

1465
01:50:53,713 --> 01:50:58,047
You don't worry sis, we'll conduct
your marriage with great pomp and splendor

1466
01:50:58,184 --> 01:50:59,082
Get lost!

1467
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:01,798
Oh God! My son!

1468
01:53:12,118 --> 01:53:13,380
Brother...!

1469
01:53:16,089 --> 01:53:17,579
My son!

1470
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:44,474
The murderer nor the weapon couldn't be
traced by the police or crime branch

1471
01:53:44,751 --> 01:53:50,155
She repeatedly gave evidence against
her own family in courts and police stations

1472
01:53:51,591 --> 01:53:58,588
But power of money and lack of evidence
allowed the culprits escape from law

1473
01:54:01,367 --> 01:54:07,738
Her brothers tried to take her back home
But she did not oblige

1474
01:54:08,641 --> 01:54:13,544
She insisted that her place
was at her husband's home

1475
01:54:14,914 --> 01:54:17,246
And requested us
not to forsake her

1476
01:54:21,588 --> 01:54:25,854
Even when she got her husband's job
as his widow and came to Coimbatore...

1477
01:54:26,559 --> 01:54:31,826
...we didn't allow her to come alone
So we accompanied her here

1478
01:54:31,931 --> 01:54:36,766
Here also they began threatening her
Remember that issue on the high way?

1479
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:39,771
That is one of her brothers
trying to get her back

1480
01:54:41,841 --> 01:54:45,868
God has given her only
misfortunes and unhappiness

1481
01:54:46,746 --> 01:54:49,738
Please forget her, at least hereafter

1482
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:07,857
According to my calculation
Suresh came with Rekha to his house at 5 pm

1483
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:11,499
By 10 at night they were
in the bridal chamber

1484
01:55:11,704 --> 01:55:15,470
The murderer got in at 10:05

1485
01:55:15,608 --> 01:55:18,634
Suresh murdered at 10:10 PM

1486
01:55:18,845 --> 01:55:21,405
What do we deduct from this?

1487
01:55:21,748 --> 01:55:25,844
One thing is for sure taking
the time they went in...

1488
01:55:25,952 --> 01:55:28,443
...and the time he was murdered

1489
01:55:28,554 --> 01:55:29,452
What is that?

1490
01:55:29,722 --> 01:55:31,952
- Nothing happened
- What?

1491
01:55:32,225 --> 01:55:34,420
There has been no
physical relationship between them

1492
01:55:34,527 --> 01:55:35,721
Get lost! You ass!

1493
01:55:35,828 --> 01:55:38,695
l thought let that not be
a hindrance to this marriage

1494
01:55:38,865 --> 01:55:40,924
Deva, what do you say?

1495
01:55:41,401 --> 01:55:44,962
My feelings have intensified
lt hasn't lessened even a bit

1496
01:55:45,438 --> 01:55:48,430
Can l get a chance
to speak to Rekha?

1497
01:56:03,423 --> 01:56:07,985
Please forgive me
l'm here once again on his request

1498
01:56:09,696 --> 01:56:13,029
Don't think we are harassing you

1499
01:56:16,936 --> 01:56:18,426
Come in

1500
01:56:20,006 --> 01:56:25,603
After listening to everything
He wants to interview her

1501
01:56:27,447 --> 01:56:30,746
l told him no
But he doesn't listen

1502
01:56:31,084 --> 01:56:37,250
When his face falls, my heart breaks
lf it's no trouble, just one minute

1503
01:56:37,724 --> 01:56:39,055
She is in that room

1504
01:56:46,566 --> 01:56:47,726
Rekha...

1505
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:59,774
To love a man more than life itself
and to spend rest of life mourning his death

1506
01:57:00,313 --> 01:57:03,578
l don't understand
ls that what life is all about?

1507
01:57:06,519 --> 01:57:11,422
They say God calls back
early, those HE loves dearly

1508
01:57:11,691 --> 01:57:14,819
Just console yourself with that

1509
01:57:15,928 --> 01:57:19,056
l came behind you
without knowing anything

1510
01:57:19,332 --> 01:57:22,790
After knowing everything,
l'm asking you

1511
01:57:23,336 --> 01:57:26,499
Can we not have a life together?

1512
01:57:28,508 --> 01:57:34,037
The love in our hearts will be only
for one person in life, l know

1513
01:57:34,347 --> 01:57:36,577
lt's the same for me also

1514
01:57:40,353 --> 01:57:44,756
l will love you more than Suresh

1515
01:57:46,092 --> 01:57:49,425
Just give me an answer today

1516
01:57:50,763 --> 01:57:56,463
And still if you don't like me
Just say so, l will go away

1517
01:57:57,103 --> 01:58:01,631
l will live the rest of my life
like you are doing now

1518
01:58:03,176 --> 01:58:08,671
Why are you not saying anything?
Tell me something

1519
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:11,983
- She will not answer you
- Don't be stubborn

1520
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:14,849
Deva, she hasn't spoken since birth

1521
01:58:15,121 --> 01:58:18,955
- You mean she is dumb?
- Yes

1522
01:58:32,872 --> 01:58:40,074
Suresh knew it and still loved her
l thought you knew this

1523
01:58:52,492 --> 01:58:54,050
She won't speak to you

1524
01:59:02,168 --> 01:59:04,159
Come, l want to speak to you

1525
01:59:13,246 --> 01:59:17,842
That girl has suffered a lot
We didn't know it

1526
01:59:18,551 --> 01:59:20,212
Now what shall we do?

1527
01:59:21,087 --> 01:59:25,786
- Brother, l want to marry only her
- She can't speak

1528
01:59:26,192 --> 01:59:29,684
Whatever her shortcomings
l am prepared to put up with it

1529
01:59:30,029 --> 01:59:32,691
l love her that much!

1530
01:59:32,899 --> 01:59:35,026
lf you love her so much
lt's fine with me also

1531
01:59:35,134 --> 01:59:36,066
Brother!

1532
01:59:36,235 --> 01:59:38,829
ln a way it's better
she can't speak

1533
01:59:38,938 --> 01:59:41,463
At least you won't
land up in a situation like mine

1534
01:59:41,574 --> 01:59:45,635
But she has not agreed so far

1535
01:59:45,945 --> 01:59:50,609
lf she doesn't agree,
l won't ever marry

1536
01:59:52,251 --> 01:59:57,621
Did you see his love for you?
This is true love

1537
01:59:58,157 --> 02:00:00,125
Love should be given in return for love

1538
02:00:00,526 --> 02:00:04,826
lf you refuse this love
Even the Gods won't tolerate

1539
02:00:06,299 --> 02:00:10,759
Suresh's mom and sister
wants you to live a good life

1540
02:00:10,937 --> 02:00:12,666
They want to see you happy

1541
02:00:15,208 --> 02:00:19,838
When they see your unhappiness
lt pains them more than Suresh's death

1542
02:00:19,946 --> 02:00:21,937
Otherwise, let them say it's not true

1543
02:00:22,748 --> 02:00:25,182
My dear, you must accept this

1544
02:00:28,187 --> 02:00:30,212
One minute!

1545
02:00:30,856 --> 02:00:33,290
Agreed you can't speak
But you can write, isn't it?

1546
02:00:33,593 --> 02:00:38,223
Just take paper and pen and write
That you like me

1547
02:00:38,331 --> 02:00:40,265
Just write it
lt will be really great

1548
02:00:40,866 --> 02:00:44,700
lf you find it difficult to write
Then show it in symbols

1549
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:49,000
Like this
l...love...you

1550
02:00:49,275 --> 02:00:52,301
l love you
You...you

1551
02:00:54,714 --> 02:00:56,841
She smiled
Brother she smiled

1552
02:00:57,049 --> 02:01:00,917
Hey! Put me down
Put me down

1553
02:01:01,287 --> 02:01:04,620
l am telling you

1554
02:01:04,857 --> 02:01:07,155

lt's fixed
The wedding is fixed

1556
02:01:20,139 --> 02:01:24,906

We will conduct the wedding
Here, right in front of you

1564
02:01:54,006 --> 02:01:54,938
Yes

1565
02:01:55,308 --> 02:01:57,276
Shouldn't we invite the villains?

1566
02:01:57,343 --> 02:01:59,811
Hey! Villians!

1567
02:02:01,714 --> 02:02:03,375

Sure we will

1584

Brother! Shouldn't we invite
our brothers-in-law for our party?

1585

Sorry, we could not

Do you think he will have
a wedding at all?

1642
02:07:30,342 --> 02:07:33,368
Before that the groom will die, won't he?

1643
02:07:39,685 --> 02:07:42,518
He disappeared to Mumbai
after Suresh's death

1644
02:07:42,588 --> 02:07:45,682
Now he's appeared again
to finish you off

1645

Vikram!

My dear brothers
younger and older, greetings

1648
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:34,229
You didn't expect us here, right?
We always do the unexpected

1649
02:09:34,566 --> 02:09:37,660
From the minute we came
to your house

1650
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:40,068
We have been expecting
an attack from you

1651
02:09:40,372 --> 02:09:41,361
lsn't it brother?.

1652
02:09:41,507 --> 02:09:45,807
Yes, allowing me to travel alone tonight
and giving you a chance to confront me...

1653
02:09:46,078 --> 02:09:49,411
...to get you here is
brothers brilliant idea

1654
02:09:49,782 --> 02:09:53,718
We assumed this guy
who has been elusive...

1655
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:59,349
...to Kerala crime branch and
Kerala police will come again

1656
02:09:59,625 --> 02:10:02,856

...house number were all
given to us by Kerala police

1658
02:10:07,132 --> 02:10:11,398
Gopi, people here have not
seen us in action

1659
02:10:11,503 --> 02:10:13,596
Should we not show our prowess, Deva?

1660
02:10:13,739 --> 02:10:16,503
- Who will begin, you or l?
- We'll do it together

1661
02:10:16,575 --> 02:10:19,442
- Shall we flatten them or pulp them
- We'll extract their 'beans'

1662
02:10:19,511 --> 02:10:21,877
- Then we'll do it together
- Sure we will, it will be wonderful

1663
02:10:22,114 --> 02:10:24,378
- Sure we will
- Gopi, you can go take rest

1664
02:10:51,343 --> 02:10:56,212
Vikram Chetri, don't listen to their blabber
Just beat them down

1665
02:13:20,525 --> 02:13:23,688
- Now give it to them
- Okay, brother

1666
02:13:51,523 --> 02:13:56,893
Boss, my body is aching standing idle
l am yearning to give a few punches

1667
02:13:56,962 --> 02:14:01,058
Please give me also a chance
One kick and two blows, okay?

1668
02:14:14,479 --> 02:14:16,709
lsn't the wedding today?
We don't see anyone

1669
02:14:16,848 --> 02:14:19,112
The wedding is to be held
at Malikapuram house...

1670
02:14:19,384 --> 02:14:21,978
...and entire police force
is invited was what Kamath said

1671
02:14:22,087 --> 02:14:24,419
Wedding decorations
seems to be missing

1672
02:14:38,103 --> 02:14:40,003
lsn't it here the wedding
is to be, Kamath?

1673
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:42,734
Sure in another 10 minutes

1674
02:14:42,908 --> 02:14:48,073
We didn't invite you forthe wedding alone
But to get you a promotion too

1675
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:50,111
Gopi!

1676
02:14:51,950 --> 02:14:55,613
Let them come out
Let all villains come out

1677
02:14:56,822 --> 02:15:00,622
These are the culprits who caused
Kerala police hang their heads in shame

1678
02:15:00,725 --> 02:15:02,886
- We are handing them over to you
- Okay, okay

1679
02:15:02,994 --> 02:15:06,953
But don't mention we handed them over
Promotion is assured

1680
02:15:07,132 --> 02:15:08,963
- Take them
- That's all

1681
02:15:09,101 --> 02:15:10,534
Get going

1682
02:15:12,704 --> 02:15:16,800
There comes the elusive
culprit Vikram Chetri

1683
02:15:16,875 --> 02:15:17,864
He is the main culprit

1684
02:15:17,943 --> 02:15:19,808
- ls he dead?
- No

1685
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:22,175
He tried to escape from the jeep
l just broke his backbone

1686
02:15:22,447 --> 02:15:25,109
No use living any more
He as good as dead..the corpse!

1687
02:15:26,218 --> 02:15:28,186
Thank you

1688
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:29,387
What about the wedding?

1689
02:15:29,488 --> 02:15:33,117
All ready
lt will soon be set up

1690
02:16:09,027 --> 02:16:12,827
Grandmother, we have kept our word...

1691
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:18,830
...lf Raja enters the fray it
will be a real game

1692
02:16:21,773 --> 02:16:23,206
Now tie the sacred wedding thread

1693
02:16:35,253 --> 02:16:39,690
Brother
Don't leave Mahalakshmi alone

1694
02:16:39,791 --> 02:16:42,589
Who says we'll leave Mahalakshmi alone?

1695
02:16:43,094 --> 02:16:45,756
l have decided certain course of action

1696
02:16:46,031 --> 02:16:49,125
Gopi! Go bring the sacred
wedding chain and garland

1697
02:16:49,267 --> 02:16:50,632
Brother

1698
02:16:51,269 --> 02:16:52,133
Take it

1699
02:16:54,172 --> 02:16:58,768
One more person has to come
After that we will tie this

1700
02:16:59,144 --> 02:17:02,011
- Ask him to come
- Please come

1701
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:11,678
Mahalakshmi's wedding that once
got cancelled will be conducted by me

1702
02:17:11,790 --> 02:17:14,918
He considers Mahalakshmi
more precious than life

1703
02:17:15,026 --> 02:17:17,517
That's why he remained
unmarried till now, cunning fellow

1704
02:17:17,596 --> 02:17:20,690
l discovered this
Okay, let the ritual take place

1705
02:17:23,835 --> 02:17:25,928
- Brother
- What?

1706
02:17:26,304 --> 02:17:30,001
- l thought...?
- What did you think?

1707
02:17:30,675 --> 02:17:34,236
- Mahalakshmi?
- That l will marry Mahalakshmi

1708
02:17:34,346 --> 02:17:34,971
Yes

1709
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:38,641
Then it will become like any other story
This is a different climax

1710
02:17:38,717 --> 02:17:39,206
What?

1711
02:17:39,317 --> 02:17:44,983
ln this malayali land, l am going
to live long without a female partner

1712
02:17:45,156 --> 02:17:47,249
lt will be great fun for everyone, right?

1713
