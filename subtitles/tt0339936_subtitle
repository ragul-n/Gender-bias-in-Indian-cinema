1
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:24,000
Some say that they have a right on this land. 

2
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:28,500
Some say that they have a right on the ocean. 

3
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:33,000
Some say that they have a right on the sun and the moon. 

4
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,708
But the silence if the maker above says that.. 

5
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:44,583
..you fools, it is only who has the right on the whole universe 

6
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,500
 Hey, good. The time is up. 

7
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,375
 One, two, three, four. 

8
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,916
Pyarelal, stop it. I said stop it. Pyarelal. 

9
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,333
 Oh, my God. Stop it. 

10
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,208
 Pyarelal. 

11
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,208
 Very good. You got up? 

12
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,875
 You idiot, what is all this? 

13
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,000
All these are the wonders of my brain, Anju baby. 

14
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,916
You had told me to wake you up exactly at 7 o'clock. 

15
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,375
I had asked you, how should I wake you up? 

16
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,500
Ring the bell and wake you, wake you with cold water.. 

17
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,000
 ..wake you with the bark of a dog? 

18
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,083
You said that you did not know anything. Use your brain. 

19
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:38,416
So I used my brain. And I woke you up at the exact time. 

20
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,666
You bloddy stupid fool, let Uncle come. 

21
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,208
I will get you fired from the job, today itself. 

22
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,708
 Who wants the job? 

23
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,083
I was thinking this is my father's house.. 

24
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,291
Greetings sir. - Greetings. 

25
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,083
 What is all this going on dear? 

26
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,500
See, Uncle I just slept after doing the rehearsal.. 

27
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:57,208
..the whole night. I told this fool to wake me at 7 in the evening 

28
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,375
But he woke me up, now that is 7 in the morning. 

29
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,041
In this I am not at all in fault, Anju baby. 

30
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,791
All these are the problems of the English people's, AM & PM 

31
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,500
Okay brother, all of you go now, and.. 

32
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,125
 ..come back at 7 in the evening. 

33
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,208
 It is okay now, isn't it, Anju baby? 

34
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,916
Get out, get out all of you or else I will shoot all of you. 

35
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,208
But dear, what was the need for you to practice dancing.. 

36
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,375
 ..the whole night? 

37
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,208
 Hey, Uncle, you don't understand. 

38
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,500
This year's dance competition in Mumbai this year.. 

39
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,375
 ..is very, very challenging. 

40
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,500
And my daughter, never gets defeated in any challenge. 

41
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,250
 Correct? 

42
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,833
 Correct. 

43
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,958
 Boss. Boss. Boss. Boss. 

44
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,166
 What is the matter, Hariya. 

45
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,500
The Banjaras, have again attacked our godowns. 

46
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,041
 Uncle. 

47
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:06,500
 Attack them. Kill them. 

48
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,375
 Destruction. 

49
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:07,708
Wherever Bhairav Singh goes, the storm of destruction comes 

50
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,291
 Destruction. 

51
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,583
 Come on. 

52
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,583
 Boss. Boss. Boss. 

53
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,166
 Hey, Balram what happened to you. 

54
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,541
 Come I will take you to the doctor. 

55
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,750
This wound will be made okay by the doctor, boss. 

56
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,875
But if their knife would have gone through my chest, then? 

57
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,666
Boss, we eat from the salary from you. 

58
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,208
 We can shed our blood for you. 

59
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,583
 But we can't give our life for you. 

60
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:11,208
Because we too have family. We too have family. 

61
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,500
After today, till the police come here.. 

62
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,333
 ..no one will do any work here. 

63
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,125
Yes, yes. No one will do any work here. 

64
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,125
 No one will work here. 

65
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:22,083
 Wait. No one has to go anywhere. 

66
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,375
I am going right now and bring the police here. 

67
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,416
Wait, daughter, wait. The police will not come here. 

68
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,166
 But why will it not come, Uncle? 

69
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,625
These Banjaras, often come here and loot our things. 

70
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,583
And you don't allow any one to tell the police. 

71
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,125
I am asking, why are you so afraid of the police? 

72
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:42,125
Did you do any crime, or are a murderer? 

73
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,458
 Or are you a criminal? 

74
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,375
Yes, dear. Yes. Your Uncle, is a criminal for the law. 

75
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,500
 Criminal? Till today.. 

76
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,250
..I hid this bitter truth from you. 

77
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,208
Not because I am afraid of the punishment the law will give. 

78
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,500
But it is because, even when in the eyes of law.. 

79
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,583
..I am a criminal, but in the eyes of Justice.. 

80
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,958
 ..I am not a criminal. 

81
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,500
Yet, I am leaving this decision to you today.. 

82
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:12,375
..to decide whether, I am a criminal or not. 

83
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,500
This matter took place at that time.. 

84
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,000
 ..when you had not come in my life. 

85
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,708
 I had a small family. 

86
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,666
 My wife, my son. 

87
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,666
 We were celebrating, Diwali. 

88
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,500
Listen, every day because of your work.. 

89
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,708
..you are able to spend some time with me and Vicky. 

90
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,500
But today when you got time during, Diwali.. 

91
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,375
 ..today too you are going to gamble. 

92
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,125
At least remain with us today, and celebrate the festival. 

93
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,291
And you have to worship mother Laxmi too today. 

94
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Goddess Laxmi, has given me without my worship.. 

95
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,125
..a wife like you and a son like, Vicky. 

96
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,791
 Papa, don't go. 

97
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,166
Did you see? Your son too is telling you not to go. 

98
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,666
At least to make him happy, you stay back. 

99
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,500
Shalu, I would definitely be with you. 

100
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,000
But they are waiting outside to take me with them. 

101
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Cote, my intentions are this. Some how I hit the target.. 

102
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,500
..with my plan that all the properties of Virendar.. 

103
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,666
 ..come to me. 

104
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,500
Brother, if our club works well then not only Virendar's.. 

105
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,500
..but one day we will have all the riches of.. 

106
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,541
..the creamy layer of this whole area. 

107
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,708
 Hello. Hello. 

108
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,875
 Come. 

109
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
 Cut, Mr. Virendar, sir. 

110
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,833
 Take these, 9, 10. Jack. 

111
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,708
Sorry, brother, this happens in a game. 

112
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:25,625
 7, 8, 9. Sorry, once again. 

113
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:31,625
What ever I brought with me, is finished. I am leaving. 

114
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,625
 What are you saying, Virendar sir. 

115
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,291
 The game has only started now. 

116
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,958
 And you get up and walk. 

117
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,500
On the night of Diwali, you should have brought.. 

118
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,583
..that much money, as per to your status. 

119
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,500
Quiet, how dare you talk to, Virendar, sir,. 

120
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,833
 ..in such a manner, you idiot? 

121
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,500
Golu, give Virendar, a credit of Rs.5 lakh.. 

122
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,041
 ..from my account. 

123
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,375
What happened? How did this happen. Hey. 

124
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,500
 What happened, what happened? 

125
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,166
 What happened. 

126
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,500
Sir, Virendar the money that I gave now as a loan.. 

127
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:11,083
 ..I have to pay that money tomorrow. 

128
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:15,375
If I am not able to pay, then I will be destroyed. 

129
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:20,291
No, no. You come with me right now to my house. 

130
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,500
I do not have that much cash, but I have some jewellery.. 

131
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,375
 ..and the papers of my bungalow. 

132
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,541
 That I will give you. 

133
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,708
 At last the same thing happened.. 

134
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,875
 ..which I was afraid of. 

135
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,041
They have deceived you and looted you. 

136
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,500
But I will not let you give, the jewellery, and.. 

137
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,125
 ..papers of this bungalow. 

138
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,500
You don't understand, Shalu. If I don't repay my debt now.. 

139
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,083
 ..I won't be respected any more. 

140
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,500
And when my family jewellery is sold.. 

141
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,000
 ..when this bungalow is auctioned.. 

142
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,291
..at that time how much honor will be left then? 

143
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,541
 Shalu. 

144
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,000
 Hey, Virendar, what are you saying? 

145
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:01,500
She is saying correctly. These jewellery are not for.. 

146
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,500
 ..repaying the debts of a gamble.. 

147
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:10,041
..but to embellish her beautiful body. 

148
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,208
 You dirty fellow. 

149
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,333
 No. 

150
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,000
 You go from here, immediately. 

151
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,208
 You dirty fellow. 

152
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,875
 You go from here. 

153
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,000
But. Shalum, how I can go leaving you and Vicky. 

154
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,375
 You don't worry about me. 

155
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,625
 I swear that you must go now. 

156
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,083
 Open the door. 

157
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,833
I swear on your son, Vicky you go from here. 

158
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,958
 You go from the back door. Go. 

159
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,500
Dear, I ran from the police that day, and 

160
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,958
 ..I am running today till today. 

161
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,208
But, Uncle what happened to, Aunt and Vicky. 

162
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,500
When the storm of misfortune comes, dear.. 

163
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:26,583
..it takes everything with it except grief, and tears. 

164
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
After I left, those villains took revenge on them.. 

165
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:35,375
..for not finding me, by burning them. 

166
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:42,916
But, my heart still says that they are alive even today. 

167
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,708
 The maker can not be so cruel.. 

168
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,500
..the he will give the punishment due to me.. 

169
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,750
 ..to my wife and son. No. 

170
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,500
Uncle, if God was angry with you, then in that bus accident.. 

171
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:57,500
..in which my parents were killed along with all.. 

172
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:01,833
..the other passengers, and I became alone in this world. 

173
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,041
And then why did God save only you among them all? 

174
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,500
May, God wanted us two support less people.. 

175
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:13,500
..to support each other. And after that as you came in life.. 

176
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:18,000
 ..the doors of riches opened for me. 

177
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,500
And the Virendra, who used to loiter in the streets.. 

178
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,583
 ..has become, Sardar Rajpal, today. 

179
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:28,000
Uncle, if really I am so lucky for you.. 

180
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:33,791
..then it will be due to me, that you will meet Aunt and Vicky. 

181
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,500
 But, Uncle we have to do something.. 

182
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,333
 ..about these Banjaras. 

183
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:51,458
Yes. I have thought of a ruse for that too. 

184
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,916
 You are going to, Mumbai tomorrow. 

185
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,500
You give an advertisement in the papers there.. 

186
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,500
..that we need a young and strong manager.. 

187
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,500
..who is not only expert in the management work.. 

188
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,541
..but is an expert in martial arts too. 

189
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:14,500
Advertisement? Uncle, tell me by what name you called.. 

190
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,083
 ..your wife, at home? 

191
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,166
 Shalu. Why? 

192
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,750
Now you rest assured that you have got, Aunt and Vicky. 

193
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,625
 Got them? How is that? 

194
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:32,666
Leave that to me. It is easy for me. Yahoo. 

195
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:55,291
Left, right, Left, right, Left, right, Left, right, ugh. 

196
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,500
Hey, he killed me. Is it your hand or a hammer? 

197
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,541
 Hey, Ganiya how was my new punch? 

198
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,875
Brother, this punch will puncture the best. 

199
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,791
But my dear, I had asked you to prepare for the interview. 

200
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,875
And you are getting ready for a fight? 

201
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,333
I am fed up of searching a job for you. 

202
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,500
 I am going friend. 

203
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,333
 Hey, listen to me, Ganiya. 

204
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:55,000
See, you have brought me an accountant's job. Right? 

205
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,500
Nowadays, people want such an account.. 

206
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,500
..who keeps account properly, and when needed.. 

207
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,958
 ..can make the accounts okay too. 

208
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,291
 Yes. 

209
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,500
You read in the papers daily, that some where looting.. 

210
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,875
..some where dacoits, some where robbery. 

211
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,208
 Catch, catch, thief. 

212
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:15,166
See, what did I say? Did I not say correctly? 

213
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,166
 Now you go, I will follow you. Go. 

214
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:22,875
 Catch, catch, thief. 

215
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,333
 Catch, catch, thief. 

216
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,125
 Catch him catch him. 

217
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,791
Now that I have relieved myself I am happy. 

218
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,041
 Hey, stand aside. 

219
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,208
 Hey what are you doing? 

220
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,916
What I am doing? I was doing, or you were doing? 

221
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,250
 That is over, now what? 

222
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:52,000
Over? Run, there is a thief, run. Hey, run. 

223

 No you run.

 Thief, thief. Catch him. 

225
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,541
It is very difficult to run with sarong. 

226
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,125
 Catch. Catch. There he is running. 

227
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,416
 Shall I stop? No I will be looted. 

228
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,750
 Hey, so many thieves? 

229
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,208
Are they the forty thieves of, Alibaba? 

230
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,500
But, I too am a Sindi, I won't get frightened. 

231
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,208
 I will be courageous, I will run.

00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,583
If I die, then my wife will become a widow. 

238
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,291
 And the other will become, free. 

239
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,500
 Hey, don't beat me. Don't beat me. 

240

00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,500
Do you know, on the way I caught a pick pocket..

00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,041
 ..and beat him a lot. 

272
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:56,208
Jhulelal, whose face did I see early in the morning?

 You did a wonderful thing. 

289
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,875
This pickpocket would pick the pocket of the boss too. 

290
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,125
 Hey, he is the boss, Chelaramani. 

291
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,291

00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,750
 ..Late Chelaramani & sons. 

295
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,208
 Listen to what I am saying, Boss. 

296
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,916
I don't want to hear anything, go from here. Go. 

297
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,166
 Come on. 

298
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,416
Do it in your underwear, do it in your sarong. 

299
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,625
 But never do it on the road. 

300
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,291
 Live, my dear. 

301
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,541
Hey, friend tell me, what you have done.. 

302
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,083
 ..that you are going on laughing? 

303
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,000
You are laughing, and shouting live, live. 

304
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,500
Then listen. Today the rich man whose pocket I picked.. 

305
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,041
 ..the people around shouted. 

306
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:28,375
Hey, the people always shout. Then what happened? 

307
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,208
Then what happened? Then came a foolish rich man. 

308
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,750
 He ran with the fright of the thief. 

309
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,166
A foolish rich man? Then what happened? 

310
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,500
Then another fool came there. He caught the first fool.. 

311
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,916
 ..thinking that he is the thief. 

312
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,375
 Then what happened? 

313
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,833
Then the second fool beat the first fool a lot. 

314
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:50,583
 And that lean, dry fish, half dead.. 

315
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,500
..thought himself to be Dara Singh, and the sixth son.. 

316
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,166
 ..of Mike Tyson. 

317
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,166
 Then what happened? 

318
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,333
 Then he broke the other's bones. 

319
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,250
I was sitting behind the car and enjoying the scene. 

320
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:16,875
Dry fish, lean, sixth son of Mike Tyson? 

321
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,125
You fool, because of you I lost my job, do you know that? 

322
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,875
 Hey, a very good think happened. 

323
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,500
A job is not written in your fate. In your fate.. 

324
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,166
..is written your own business. Own business. 

325
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,500
Brother, sign on this, and start your own.. 

326
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,041
 ..independent business. 

327
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,500
 Business? What business? 

328
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,500
Hey, it is the same business, without investment.. 

329
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,500
..without laboring, with courage and slyness.. 

330
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,250
..meaning, showing the knack of one's hands. 

331
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,583
I am the president of all India Pickpockets association. 

332
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:46,916
Start today. I don't even want your joining fees too. 

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,833
Hey, you want to make me a pick pocket? I will make.. 

334
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,500
 Police, police. Run. 

335
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,125
Hey, what a man he is, simply beating me up. 

336
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,000
 Hey, rickshaw wait. Cycle, cycle. 

337
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,500
sit in the cycle and run. Hey he is chasing.. 

338
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,958
 ..my God, save me from him. 

339
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:05,208
Did not even allow me to eat the chicken. 

340
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:13,000
Hey, madam. Daughter of a blind man. Can't you see? 

341
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:29,875
You son of Tata, is the muck smelling bad? 

342
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Here, take this, Rs.5, go and get your clothes cleaned.. 

343
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:44,500
..in a laundry. A listen, your own face too. 

344
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,166
 Stupid. 

345
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,333
 How dare you? 

346
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,083
Madam, when you throw muck at others.. 

347
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,291
 ..what you get is muck too. 

348
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,500
And remember one thing, that this muck can be cleaned.. 

349
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,125
 ..with any soap. 

350
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:52,500
But the muck of being rich in your head.. 

351
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,625
..it cannot be cleaned by any soap. Understand? 

352
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:01,125
Here take Rs.10- and with this, you wash.. 

353
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:04,791
..your English, frock. And then by a Hindustani sari. 

354
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,500
I only lifted your frock. I hope one day.. 

355
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:11,375
..a hot headed man would carry you off too. 

356
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,666
 Isn't it brothers? - Yes, yes. 

357
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,625
 This man is mad. Really mad. 

358
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,000
If he remains out even one second more.. 

359
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,125
..I do not know how many more people 

360
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,208
 ..he will make mad. 

361
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,458
 Somebody, please call the police. 

362
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,958
 Please call the police. 

363
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,708
 Put him inside. 

364
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,708
 Hey, inspector, I am not mad. 

365
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:35,875
Every mad man in this world says the same thing. 

366
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,625
Which sign of madness did you see in me? 

367
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:42,583
The justice is blind. It does not see. It only hears, what? 

368
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,166
 At least let me ring my friend. 

369
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,666
 A friend of a mad man? 

370
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:54,000
If you had any friend, would he not have freed you by now? 

371
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,625
 I have come, Inspector. 

372
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:00,666
 Is it you? 

373
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,791
 Yes. Me. 

374
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:06,000
I understand. You picked some one's pocket again.. 

375
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,208
 ..and the people are behind you. 

376
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,000
And you came inside the police station.. 

377
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:12,041
..to escape from them. Come on remove the goods. 

378
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,458
 And what is this? 

379
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:17,000
Bail. Today I have not come here to escape.. 

380
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:20,416
..but I have come here to bail some one out. 

381
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,291
 Wear your specs and see. 

382
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,000
I have brought a special bail, from a special court.. 

383
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,125
 ..and from a special magistrate. 

384
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:32,333
For my friend. He is my friend. That, too very close. 

385
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,791
 Havaldar, remove the man out. 

386
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:40,458
You are a pick pocket and how can you bail some one out? 

387
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:45,041
Why? A pick pocket can give bribe. Cannot give bail? 

388
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,000
Are you going to leave or shall I give the commissioner.. 

389
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,958
 ..the account of your bribes? 

390
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,500
 Hey, Babu why do you get angry? 

391
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:51,666
 Leave him. 

392
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,083
 Leave him.. 

393
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,250
 Leave him. 

394
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,416
 Leave him.. 

395
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:57,375
 Leave him. 

396
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:01,041
 In our first meeting, I lost my job. 

397
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,291
 In the second, I was jailed. 

398
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,791
Now after bailing me out what do you want to do? 

399
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,791
Brother, I am not as bad as you think. 

400
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,708
 Yes, I pick the people's pockets. 

401
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,333
But before looking into their pockets.. 

402
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:15,000
..I look into their hearts. I have never such a man's pockets.. 

403
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:19,041
..which there is money, but the heart is filled with sadness. 

404
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,000
My heart is not filled with sadness, but.. 

405
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:24,041
..is filled with rage for that rich girl. 

406
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,375
The one who made me mad and got me in to this jail. 

407
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,291
I have done the arrangement for that too, boss. 

408
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,833
Tonight at nine, there is a dance program.. 

409
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:35,125
..at Bhaidas hall, in which Anju is taking part. 

410
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,208
 He is mad, inspector, 

411
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,291
He is more dangerous than even a mad dog.. he is mad inspector. 

412
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:47,458
Take him away inspector he is a dangerous mad man. 

413
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:31,666
"Oh friends, there is song and music." 

414
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:39,416
"Oh friends, there is song and music." 

415
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:47,000
"My voice is there and my stylish actions are there." 

416
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:53,916
"My voice is there and my stylish actions are there." 

417
00:29:54,833 --> 00:30:01,541
"I will sing in such a manner that I will steal your hearts." 

418
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:09,750
"I will sing in such a manner that I will steal your hearts." 

419
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:13,041
 "Oh friends." 

420
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:52,750
"The singers have come, and players of music have come." 

421
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,208
"The singers have come, and players of music have come." 

422
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,625
"The singers have come, and players of music have come." 

423
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:04,208
"They don't know to dance and they have come to compete." 

424
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:07,708
"They don't know to dance and they have come to compete." 

425
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:11,166
"The singers have come, and players of music have come." 

426
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,833
"They don't know to dance and they have come to compete." 

427
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:21,625
"See my dear, the fun will start now." 

428
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:25,000
"See my dear, the fun will start now." 

429
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,541
"See my dear, the fun will start now." 

430
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,625
"See my dear, the fun will start now." 

431
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:20,208
"See, see. The girl is very angry but she is very proud." 

432
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:23,791
"See, see. The girl is very angry but she is very proud." 

433
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,000
"Tease her, tease her. One can see.." 

434
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:30,791
 "..the pride of her adulthood." 

435
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:34,000
One can see.." - "..the pride of her adulthood." 

436
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:39,208
 "My heart says .. 

437
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,166
 "My heart says that I steal.. 

438
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,041
"My heart says that I steal the pinkness of her cheeks." 

439
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:51,166
 "That I bring her to her senses." 

440
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,708
 "That I bring her to her senses." 

441
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:58,083
"See my dear, the fun will start now." 

442
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:01,583
"See my dear, the fun will start now." 

443
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:03,000
"The girl is getting red with anger.." 

444
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:07,166
"..as though she is heated in an oven." 

445
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,375
 red with anger.." 

446
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,666
"..as though she is heated in an oven." 

447
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,000
"The horse is running breaking the ropes." 

448
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:17,708
"Friends catch her, she is a monkey." 

449
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:21,083
"Friends catch her, she is a monkey." 

450
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:25,583
 "I feel that she is mad,.. 

451
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:31,041
 "I feel that she is mad,.. 

452
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:35,166
"I feel that she is mad, as she keeps abusing me." 

453
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,375
 "we will give here punishment." 

454
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,625
 "we will give here punishment." 

455
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:45,416
"See my dear, the fun will start now." 

456
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,291
"See my dear, the fun will start now." 

457
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,250
In which corner of the world are you lost in? 

458
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,000
The time of Lord Ram's staying in forest.. 

459
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:40,208
..was over in 14 years. Then why our stay without you.. 

460
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,666
 ..is not getting over? 

461
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,000
Just come and see, that son who used to crawl.. 

462
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:48,208
 ..has grown so big. 

463
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:49,500
 Mother. 

464
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:56,000
 Vicky, when did you come dear son? 

465
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,708
 When you were talking to this photo. 

466
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:02,083
Mother, I cannot understand, what this man gave you? 

467
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:04,000
He has given this holy symbol in your mother's neck.. 

468
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:05,916
..and had put vermilion on her forehead. 

469
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Along with that he also gave you the black spot of being.. 

470
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,125
 ..a murderer's wife. 

471
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,583
Shut up. Son's clean the spots on their father. 

472
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:16,625
And you, listening to others you yourself accuse him? 

473
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:20,208
I am not staining him, mother. The stain is put on me by him. 

474
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,625
That I am a murderer's son, and a gambler's son. 

475
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:24,708
A son of such a gambler, who even laid.. 

476
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:27,166
..his own wife's honor in the game too. 

477
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:32,000
Shut up. He did not lay his wife's honor in the game, son.. 

478
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:37,208
..but to save her honor, he had put his own life in danger. 

479
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:40,916
And to save his own life, he ran away leaving his wife.. 

480
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,958
..and son at the mercy of his enemies. 

481
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,875
 I had compelled him to run, Vicky. 

482
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:49,000
But see, the day you both come face to face.. 

483
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,416
..then at that time you will understand his love for you. 

484
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:54,708
 Pray that day never comes, mother. 

485
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,625
Or else, you will have to choose one of us. 

486
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:58,625
 Vicky. 

487
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:01,333
 Your son or that murderer 

488
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,250
 What happened to this, Vicky? 

489
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,166
Any way aunt, I am fed up of your, Vicky. 

490
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,000
I search jobs for him and get it, and.. 

491
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,458
 ..he makes a mess of it and goes. 

492
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:22,833
In the whole of Mumbai, there is no job left for him. 

493
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,250
Yes, if he gets a job out of Mumbai, then alright. 

494
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,000
There is an advertisement in the newspaper.. 

495
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,500
..that an estate manager's job is vacant. 

496
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,541
 That job is suitable for our, Vicky. 

497
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,500
And it written to meet immediately at this address.

God, I thank you a lot. At last you showed kindness on me. 

509
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,625
Now that you have given me his address..

511

 ..in my son's mind for his father. 

512
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:28,000
So that even a shadow of any enemy does not fall on us. 

513
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:31,666
 Rajpal estate? 

514
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:39,791
 Yes. Son read these advertisements. 

515
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:46,166
 Dad, some Rajpal estate's address.. 

516
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,166
..is printed in these advertisements. 

517
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,166
Yes, and the boss of this Rajpal estate.. 

518
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,375
..is none other than Thakur Virendar Singh. 

519
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,625
The one who killed my brother and your Uncle and ran away. 

520
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:03,166
Long cut in short cut dad. How can you say that.. 

521
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,000
..this is the same Thakur Virendar Singh? 

522
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,041
Both the advertisements are given by, Rajpal. 

523
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:14,541
The first advertisement he has give for an estate manager. 

524
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,166
The second ad he has given for calling his wife and son.. 

525
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,750
..who got separated from him 20 years before. 

526
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:28,166
In the ad he has called his wife as Shalu.. 

527
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,000
 ..and his son by the name of, Vicky. 

528
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:36,166
And twenty years before, Virendar Singh too.. 

529
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,250
..had called his wife, Shalu, and his son as, Vicky. 

530
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:45,583
And all this he has done to escape from us and the police. 

531
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:50,083
But you had yourself killed his wife and son by burning them. 

532
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:58,791
Yes, I had done so, but after Virendar ran away. 

533
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:02,166
And that is why till today Virendar, believes that.. 

534
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,000
..that his wife and son are still alive. 

535
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,916
He is very anxious to meet his wife and son, isn't it? 

536
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:11,541
I will just now go and send him to his wife and son. 

537
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:14,166
No son, no. this work we can do by calling the police.. 

538
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,583
 ..on phone any time we want. 

539
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:19,166
By the fire of my revenge which is not yet extinguished.. 

540
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,166
..even after burning them in the fire.. 

541
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,458
..how will be put off by burning this old man's pyre. 

542
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:33,166
He will die, but not like this. But he will flutter before.. 

543
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:39,291
..I will usurp all him wealth. And you will do this work. 

544
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:41,916
 By becoming his son. 

545
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:48,000
Understood, dad. This is long cut in short cut 

546
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,916
Then prepare for leaving immediately. 

547
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,375
 All preparations ar done, mother. 

548
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,166
But I don't feeling like leaving you alone. 

549
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,083
 Shall I cancel the ticket? 

550
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,291
No. It is a only a matter of few days. 

551
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:02,833
You make arrangements for staying there. 

552
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:03,958
 Then I too will come there. 

553
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,083
Mother, in such jobs, there is no arrangements for staying. 

554
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:10,583
You have to sleep on trees and stay amongst wild animals. 

555
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,541
 - Shall I cancel the ticket? - No. 

556
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:17,291
After years of prayers, God has shown us this day. 

557
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,833
And such jobs cannot be got every now and then. 

558
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,708
But mother, where I have got the job? 

559
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:23,750
Now I have to give interview and meet the owner. 

560
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,000
 Think that everything is over. 

561
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,375
 You have got this job. 

562
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:29,083
Got the job? Mother, you are talking as though.. 

563
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,333
 ..you know this Rajpal, very well. 

564
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:35,708
Not me, my friend's husband knows him very well. 

565
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,541
Hence, I have brought a recommendation letter.. 

566
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:41,500
..for you from him. You give this to him.. 

567
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,208
..and you will immediately get the job. 

568
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,708
Vicky, the taxi has come. Come soon.. 

569
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:47,833
..the train's leaves in a short while from now. 

570
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,666
Mother, you have become emotional again? 

571
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,416
 Shall I cancel the ticket? 

572
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,666
No need for that. Take this and go quietly. 

573
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:12,416
Mother, if you feel happy that I do this work.. 

574
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,875
..then I will definitely do this work. Bless me mother.. 

575
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:19,125
 ..that I am successful. 

576
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:23,041
 My blessings are always with you. 

577
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,166
Let God, help you in completing the job.. 

578
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,000
 ..for which I am sending you. 

579
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:31,041
 I am leaving mother. 

580
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:03,875
Hey, hey give way. Guddi, I am coming. Come quickly. 

581
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:04,875
 Hey, give way. 

582
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,625
 Come, come. 

583
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:14,166
Thank God. If I was late by one more minute.. 

584
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,250
..then I would not have caught this train. 

585
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,916
Then you could come by tomorrow's train. 

586
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,250
You could have enjoyed one more day at, Mumbai. 

587
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,875
Shut, Guddi. You are talking about one day? 

588
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:26,000
 I cannot stay one minute in, Mumbai. 

589
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:28,333
That jungle animal spoiled all my mood. 

590
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,875
 Oh, God! So many abuses? 

591
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:34,166
This is ours, isn't it? I was thinking that.. 

592
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,875
 ..the train would leave. 

593
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:38,500
 Who is this? 

594
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:43,333
 Ah, a dead body. A dead body. 

595
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:48,458
You people don't be afraid. I am there. 

596
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,291
 Now I will go and pull the chain. 

597
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,166
 Pulling the chain without a reason.. 

598
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,833
..is a crime. Rs.500 fine and 3 months imprisonment. 

599
00:43:57,916 --> 00:43:59,000
 Who said this? 

600
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:00,583
 The dead body. 

601
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:02,958
 The dead body? 

602
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,625
 The dead bodies don't speak. 

603
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,750
 But, you are speaking. 

604
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,500
 Because I am not a dead body. 

605
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:11,083
But then why are you lying down like a dead body? 

606
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:12,833
 Why don't you show us your face? 

607
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,666
 Because you will not like my face. 

608
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:18,291
 No. No such thing. 

609
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,458
 Promise? 

610
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:21,000
 Yes. Promise. Promise. 

611
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:22,000
 The see me. 

612
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:24,916
 Shriek, you? 

613
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,833
 Shriek, I mean me. 

614
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,666
 How dare you come here? 

615
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,375
 The same way that you did, madam. 

616
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:33,416
 See, here. First class ticket. 

617
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,166
See, if you don't want to go jail again, then.. 

618
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,958
..immediately get down at the next station. 

619
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,166
Hey, why the next station. If you get down with me.. 

620
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,166
..let us do so, right here in the forest. What? 

621
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,375
Anju, by law we cannot force him to get down. Come here. 

622
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:55,041
See, Mister. Don't get down. But pay attention to one thing. 

623
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:58,166
If you try something, then just think that you are alone.. 

624
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,083
 ..and we are so many. Understand? 

625
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:05,958
 Okay, sisters. No excepting her. 

626
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,208
 You idiot. I will kill you. 

627
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:36,583
Looks like he was an animal in his last birth. 

628
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,583
 Cockroach.. Idea. 

629
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:52,041
 Kid.. 

630
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:49,500
 How dare you do this? 

631
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,583
 No daring, madam. Necessity. 

632
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:54,083
 That too not mine, but yours. 

633
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:56,416
Looks like you won't listen like this. 

634
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:33,250
 Go to hell. 

635
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,666
Anju, you try many thing to leave him behind. 

636
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,333
 But he will come behind you. 

637
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:50,750
If he is not thee, then his coat. See here. 

638
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:09,958
Oh, God I heard that when ever you give, then you.. 

639
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,958
..tear the roof and give. Now what is you gave.. 

640
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,500
 ..tearing the roof? 

641
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,083
 Sardar Rajpal? 

642
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:35,625
Oh, God. You have really torn the roof. 

643
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:38,958
No, Chopra sir. You know the tea from our gardens.. 

644
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,833
..are one of the finest tea in the world. 

645
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,958
Hence, its price will never come down. 

646
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:50,125
Yes, the goods will reach when ever you want. Okay. 

647
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,041
 Uncle. Hai. 

648
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:56,958
Oh, my dear, you have come? Tell me dear.. 

649
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,208
 ..how was your dance program? 

650
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:00,958
Oh, Uncle, don't ask. One donkey had come and had.. 

651
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,541
..come and had made a mess of our program. 

652
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:05,125
Then surely some female donkeys must have been there 

653
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:09,125
Oh, God. Shut up Pyarelal. You take my things and go in. 

654
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:10,083
 Idiot. 

655
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:14,958
Anyway, dear did you give that ad fro the manager? 

656
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,958
 Yes, Uncle. How would I forget that? 

657
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I have not given one but, two advertisements. 

658
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:20,208
 Two advertisements? 

659
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,666
Yes. Now you see, all your problems will.. 

660
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,083
 ..be solved like this. 

661
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:27,166
 Hey, Anju solve our problems too. 

662
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,333
 We too have to go home dear. Come. 

663
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:30,666
 Uncle, I will them home and come. 

664
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,666
 Come soon dear. 

665
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,125
I will go like this, and come like this. 

666
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:34,625
 Bye Uncle. 

667
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,208
 Bye, bye. 

668
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:46,125
Boss, a man has come who has brought this letter for you. 

669
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:58,541
 Shalu? Shalu's letter? 

670
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:02,833
Dear, probably after long years my prayers are answered. 

671
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,708
 Only today I saw your advertisement. 

672
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:10,000
Advertisement? I knew that if your crime is not crime.. 

673
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:14,000
..in the eyes of God, then one day or the other.. 

674
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:16,125
..he will surely get us all together. 

675
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:18,000
You must be thinking, why I am sending this letter.. 

676
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:19,875
 ..instead of coming personally? 

677
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:23,000
That is because, the teasing of this world.. 

678
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:25,000
..and severe testing times have made our son, Vicky.. 

679
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:26,583
 ..your enemy. 

680
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:31,000
Enemy? - Yes. You let know that you are his father.. 

681
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:34,791
..hence I am sending. Vicky in the pretext of a job. 

682
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:39,000
You give him so much love that the hatred of you.. 

683
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,791
..in his heart has turns into elixir. 

684
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:45,000
And you both become father and son, just by blood.. 

685
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,833
 ..but also become so by love too. 

686
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:50,958
Where is the man who gave you this letter? 

687
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,708
 Boss, he is sitting in the hall. 

688
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:02,000
'That is because, the teasing of this world.. 

689
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:04,000
..and severe testing times have made our son, Vicky.. 

690
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:05,416
 ..your enemy. 

691
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:10,000
You give him so much love that the hatred of you.. 

692
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:13,291
..in his heart has turns into elixir.' 

693
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:19,916
Young man, you have come for the job of our manager? 

694
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,541
 Oh, so this is the old man. 

695
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:27,000
Sir, I did not want to come, but mother insisted on it. 

696
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:29,666
That if at all I do a job, then I do it only with you. 

697
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,000
 Yes, mother is like a, God to me. 

698
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:37,000
 Now if you want take management or.. 

699
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:41,541
..any tests in martial arts, then you can take it. 

700
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:45,583
The biggest test of a man is his character. 

701
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:49,000
And the man who considers his mother like, God.. 

702
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:51,625
.then there is no need to take his test. 

703
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,000
Just think that from today you are the.. 

704
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:55,750
 ..new owner of this estate. 

705
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,083
 What I mean is a new manager. 

706
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:03,750
 I am very happy to meet you. Hariya. 

707
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:05,000
 Yes, sir. 

708
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,833
Take the things of the new Manager to his cottage. 

709
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:09,750
 Come on, sir. 

710
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,000
 Thank you. 

711
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:20,875
Shalu, in spite of being alone, how well you have.. 

712
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,583
 ..reared my son. 

713
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,458
Hello. - Dad. 

714
00:52:28,541 --> 00:52:30,125
The gaps fit and the matter is a hit. 

715
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:33,000
Dad, you told me that you had burned this.. 

716
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:35,375
..old man's wife and son. But they are alive dad. 

717
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:38,000
Alive? Now even if his real son comes here.. 

718
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:40,250
 ..then I will take care of him. 

719
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
But dad by that time, you do long cut in short cut.. 

720
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:45,791
 ..of the old woman. 

721
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:46,833
 Okay, I will do that. 

722
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,000
 Who are you all? 

723
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,750
 Your death. 

724
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:49,000
If you don't want to die young, then tell me.. 

725
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:50,541
 ..where is, Shalu? 

726
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:53,333
 Who? Aunt, Shalini? 

727
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:57,000
She has gone on a pilgrimage of fourteen holy places. 

728
00:53:58,666 --> 00:54:00,458
A pilgrimage of fourteen holy places? 

729
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:06,000
Looks like the old woman is herself anxious.. 

730
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:11,000
..to go to, God. Okay, at least for the present.. 

731
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:16,333
..thorn in Shakti's way seems to be going away by itself. 

732
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:23,541
Tell me, whether you slept well in your cottage? 

733
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:25,458
 - No, sir. No. - Why? 

734
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:28,000
Because I was thinking the whole night, that when.. 

735
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:30,000
..it will be dawn, and when I will do work? 

736
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:33,250
Because my mother had said, son where you are going. 

737
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,833
 ..you do work. Don't take rest. 

738
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:41,958
 Sir, you bungalow is very good. 

739
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:46,000
I four more such Bungalows, by the grace of God. 

740
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:49,750
 I have tea gardens, forests of teak. 

741
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:50,833
 Good morning, Uncle. 

742
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:52,208
 Good morning. 

743
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:55,083
 A beauty in the Jungle, too? 

744
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:00,458
 This is my adopted daughter. Anju. 

745
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:04,041
 And he is our estate's new manager. 

746
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:06,125
 I had told you yesterday, isn't it? 

747
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,375
 How did you like our place? 

748
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:15,375
Anju, I believe that work is worship. 

749
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,583
 And the place we work as heaven. 

750
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:20,083
 And heaven is never bad. 

751
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:22,000
 Even then if you have any problems.. 

752
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:25,000
..or you need anything, then don't hesitate in saying so. 

753
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:27,916
Now it is my duty to keep the troubles away. 

754
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:31,375
 Yours and the Sardar's. 

755
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:35,000
Really, Uncle you have selected a very good manager. 

756
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,291
Come dear, let us show him around our estate. 

757
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:39,125
 Come. 

758
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,041
 Come. 

759
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,708
 Vicky, these are our farms. 

760
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:49,166
 From that mountain to that mountain. 

761
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:52,000
And this is the place, sir where the Banjaras.. 

762
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:54,041
..cut the head off the last manager's body. 

763
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,208
 Sorry for the fright I gave you. 

764
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,500
And the place you see now, are our teak wood, jungle. 

765
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:04,541
 It is spread far and wide. 

766
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:07,000
And it is this place where the previous to that manager's.. 

767
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:09,000
..intestines were removed by tearing his stomach.. 

768
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:10,750
 ..and threw it in the jungle. 

769
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,125
 Shut up, Pyarelal. 

770
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:15,541
Am I telling something wrong? I am telling the truth, baby. 

771
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,666
 And all these tea gardens are ours. 

772
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:25,208
 What had happened here? 

773
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:26,666
 Till now nothing has happened. 

774
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:28,041
 But it will happen now. 

775
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:29,291
 What do you mean? 

776
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:30,833
 I mean that you have come now. 

777
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:37,000
Sir, I will teach these, Banjaras such a lesson.. 

778
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:42,125
..that forget coming here, they will forget.. 

779
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:44,916
 ..even to look this side. Yes. 

780
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,666
 And this is our depot. 

781
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,041
The tea from the tea gardens are packed here. 

782
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:55,291
 Greetings, sir. 

783
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:56,458
 Greetings. 

784
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:57,291
 How are you, Baliram? 

785
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:58,625
 I am alright, sir. 

786
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,916
Have you loaded the goods in the truck, for Sitapur? 

787
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,041
 I am getting that done. Sir. 

788
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,208
That Rohtak and Kanpur, goods I have sent sir. 

789
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:05,375
 Very good. 

790
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:06,750
 - And Baliram. - Yes, sir. 

791
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:08,000
You were saying that you want.. 

792
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:10,041
 ..a good and brave manager. 

793
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,041
 Yes. 

794
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:13,041
Then this is the new manager, Mr. Vicky. 

795
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:13,916
 Greetings, sir. 

796
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,291
 Ok. Sir, the work is very big. 

797
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:20,083
Long cut in short cut, is the profit big too or not? 

798
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:22,333
Anyway, in a year, we get 14 to 15 crores. 

799
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,083
But if we get a person who can sweat.. 

800
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:26,375
 ..then we can get Rs.20 crores, too. 

801
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,083
 Rs. 20 crores? 

802
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,083
For Rs.20 crores, I can not only sweat but.. 

803
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:33,000
 ..can make blood flow too. 

804
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:34,000
 Blood? 

805
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:38,375
What I mean sir, if for you I can make my blood into sweat. 

806
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,166
 Sir, the Banjaras. 

807
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,083
You villains, you had to come today itself? 

808
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:57,500
 Destruction. 

809
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:59,166
 Uncle, where are you taking me? 

810
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:00,916
 Loot them. 

811
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,166
No need to run. We have a new manager today with us. 

812
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,958
 No. 

813
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:09,250
 Uncle. 

814
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:11,333
 What have I gotten into? 

815
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:13,500
 No. 

816
00:58:13,666 --> 00:58:15,083
 Manager, what are you doing here? 

817
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:16,750
I am searching for the, Banjaras here. 

818
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:19,166
The Banjaras, are there. Go and face them there. 

819
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,083
 Why do you search them here? 

820
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,000
Sir, will face them. I will go and protect, Anju. 

821
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,250
 This too is correct. 

822
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:29,750
 Destruction. 

823
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:48,416
Destruction. Come. Blood for Blood. Life for life. 

824
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,458
 You have killed a, Banjara. 

825
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:55,083
As per the laws of the Banjara, you will beheaded.. 

826
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:59,083
 ..by the daughter of that Banjara.. 

827
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:01,833
..in full view of the whole Kabila. Shiva take this man. 

828
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,000
 They have gone? 

829
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,416
 Where are you all? Come before me. 

830
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,208
 I will drink your blood one by one. 

831
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:14,291
 If you are a man, come before me. 

832
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:15,666
If you have drunk your mother's milk.. 

833
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,833
 ..then come before me. 

834
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:19,958
Where are they? Why are you shouting? They have left. 

835
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,416
 They have taken the boss and left. 

836
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,416
 The boss? Where have they taken him? 

837
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:42,083
Hey, Rajpal. You must have heard the sentence of death.. 

838
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:46,083
..many times over. But the death you will get today.. 

839
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:49,083
..hearing that even the most stone hearted man's.. 

840
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:51,250
 ..soul will shiver in fear. 

841
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:55,250
The souls of a coward shivers on seeing a brave man. 

842
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,083
 But remember one thing.. 

843
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:59,166
..that the hands of the one who saves is much longer.. 

844
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,541
 ..than the one who kills. 

845
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,583
Brave, young man, you really are an angel sent by, God. 

846
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,083
 How can I repay your debt? 

847
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,166
Just keep your hand on my head and bless me. 

848
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,083
My mother says, that the blessings of the elders are.. 

849
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:37,291
 ..the biggest wealth in this world. 

850
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,625
That mother is very fortunate who has a son like you. 

851
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,583
 Where do you stay? 

852
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,208
I am seeing you for the first time, in this area. 

853
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:51,750
I have come here for the first time, in search of a job. 

854
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,750
Can you tell me the address of the Bungalow, of Rajpal? 

855
01:01:58,291 --> 01:02:01,458
You are standing in front of Rajpal, right now. 

856
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:03,541
 You? 

857
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:05,708
Now you think that you got your job now. 

858
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,708
 You mean that I got this job? 

859
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,916
Where are they? Where are those, Banjaras? 

860
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,208
I will not even leave even a single, Banjara alive. 

861
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:13,500
 But this, Banjara.. No. 

862
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,375
 Uncle, are you okay, isn't it? 

863
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:19,208
I am okay dear. Where such brave young men reach.. 

864
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:21,541
 ..there everything becomes okay. 

865
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,625
I have appointed him as my estate's and jungle's.. 

866
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,125
 ..security officer. 

867
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,583
 You? 

868
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,625
 Uncle, what are you doing? 

869
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,208
You don't know that this fellow is a.. 

870
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:37,125
 ..no.1 villain, goon and a cheat. 

871
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:40,416
Whatever it is, he is nothing less than an angel for me. 

872
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,208
You know it my dear, that these Banjaras.. 

873
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,833
 ..are the enemies of our lives. 

874
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,041
 If they kidnap you are Vicky, then? 

875
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,208
In such a situation it is very necessary that.. 

876
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:50,875
..a brave man remains with us. Understood? 

877
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:56,333
What are you thinking, Anju? Even if he stays here.. 

878
01:02:56,416 --> 01:02:57,875
..he will be here as your servant, isn't it? 

879
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:00,208
Where will you get such a good chance.. 

880
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:02,291
 ..to even the insult he gave you? 

881
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:05,333
 Destruction. Destruction. 

882
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:18,541
A stranger saved, Rajpal from your hands. 

883
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:23,333
Now Bhairav's angers destruction will destroy you. 

884
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:25,791
 Destruction, Destruction, 

885
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:28,625
Stop it, Bhairav. Sot your anger, Bhairav. 

886
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:32,208
See, may be to stop this killing and bloodshed.. 

887
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:35,375
..my father is saved in spite of being shot. 

888
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:37,500
 Yes, but his blood has been let. 

889
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,208
And the policy of our, Kabila is blood for blood. 

890
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:43,583
 Listen the people of this, Kabila. 

891
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:48,708
..this is a promise by Bhairav, that Rajpal will be avenged.. 

892
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:52,208
..but before that the fire of Bhairav's destruction.. 

893
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:56,916
..will destroy the fellow who saved, Rajpal. 

894
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,666
 Destruction, Destruction, 

895
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:05,208
 Sir, sir the Banjaras, have again.. 

896
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:06,958
 ..attacked on our tea depot. 

897
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,291
 What? 

898
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:12,541
 Hey, the keys? 

899
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:26,083
 At last he got into my trap. 

900
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:29,333
Hey, Anju that fellow sat on your horse and went away. 

901
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,208
Till today, no human is born that will ride on my, Sheru.. 

902
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,791
 ..and has come back in good health. 

903
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:36,750
 This is my horse. 

904
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,208
Any one else except me, who has sat on it.. 

905
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,875
..has never return back walking on his feet. 

906
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:44,208
Oh, really? If he makes your stubborn horse into.. 

907
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:46,500
 ..tame pony then? 

908
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:48,791
 Will you wager a bet of Rs.1000? 

909
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:49,958
 One thousand each? 

910
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,875
Yes. - Okay, alright, I have done so. 

911
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:06,708
 Mother.. 

912
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:27,125
 Oh, no. Stupid horse. 

913
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:37,208
 Very good, my Sheru. Very good. 

914
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:41,958
Now do you believe? Yes. You won and I lost. 

915
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,208
Hey, come let us go and see, whether he is dead or alive? 

916
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:48,833
 That you people go and see. 

917
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:51,791
 Come on, Sheru. Come on. 

918
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:55,541
 Let us go. 

919
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:05,750
Hey, hey Sheru, what are you doing? Have you gone mad? 

920
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:08,541
 Stop it. Sheru, I said stop. Sheru. 

921
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:12,666
 You? 

922
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:17,208
Yes, me. Madam, no horse has been born on this earth.. 

923
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:23,000
..which I cannot ride. You did not win the bet, but lost it. 

924
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:24,083
 Leave me. 

925
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 You traitor. 

926
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:48,208
Ouch. The more stubborn the horse is.. 

927
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:54,375
..one gets more enjoyment riding it. Isn't it, madam? 

928
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:56,000
 You idiot. 

929
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:34,208
 "You walk carefully my dear queen." 

930
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:39,458
 "Don't act so proud, oh my sweetie." 

931
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:45,583
"Oh, my dear beautiful, Heer come into my arms.." 

932
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:47,791
 "..Let me lift you in my arms." 

933
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:51,208
"Oh, my dear beautiful, Heer come into my arms.." 

934
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:53,583
 "..Let me lift you in my arms." 

935
01:08:54,250 --> 01:09:00,000
 "You walk carefully my dear queen." 

936
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:05,125
 "Don't act so proud, oh my sweetie." 

937
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:11,208
"Oh, my dear beautiful, Heer come into my arms.." 

938
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:13,291
 "..Let me lift you in my arms." 

939
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:17,208
"Oh, my dear beautiful, Heer come into my arms.." 

940
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:20,291
 "..Let me lift you in my arms." 

941
01:09:49,416 --> 01:09:55,041
"You shake your small hips in such a way.." 

942
01:09:55,125 --> 01:10:00,625
"..that you make my heart more and more restless." 

943
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:09,541
"You shake your small hips in such a way.." 

944
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:14,708
"..that you make my heart more and more restless." 

945
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:17,791
"Your fragrant and lovely body, your adulthood.." 

946
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,416
 "..is not in your control" 

947
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:25,500
"Come and put off my fire, come, come." 

948
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:31,708
"Oh, my dear beautiful, Heer come into my arms.." 

949
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:34,125
 "..Let me lift you in my arms." 

950
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:37,458
"Oh, my dear beautiful, Heer come into my arms.." 

951
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:40,416
 "..Let me lift you in my arms." 

952
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:32,750
"One of these days I will make you mine." 

953
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:37,875
"if you won't agree like this then I will take you away." 

954
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:46,458
"One of these days I will make you mine." 

955
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:52,000
"if you won't agree like this then I will take you away." 

956
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:57,458
"Don't be so proud of yourself, turn and look this side too." 

957
01:11:57,541 --> 01:12:02,833
"smile and let the eyes meet. Come. Come." 

958
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:08,750
"Oh, my dear beautiful, Heer come into my arms.." 

959
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,958
 "..Let me lift you in my arms." 

960
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:14,208
"Oh, my dear beautiful, Heer come into my arms.." 

961
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:17,125
 "..Let me lift you in my arms." 

962
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:22,625
 "You walk carefully my dear queen." 

963
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:28,333
 "Don't act so proud, oh my sweetie." 

964
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:34,041
"Oh, my dear beautiful, Heer come into my arms.." 

965
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:36,541
 "..Let me lift you in my arms." 

966
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:40,000
"Oh, my dear beautiful, Heer come into my arms.." 

967
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:42,750
 "..Let me lift you in my arms." 

968
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:57,500
 You.. 

969
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:58,666
 I will kill you. 

970
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,291
 Save. 

971
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:25,291
 Hey what happened? 

972
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:27,958
 Save my grand child. 

973
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,166
Save the child. Save the child. Save the child. Save the child. 

974
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,833
Some one please save. Some one please save. 

975
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:36,958
Come brothers, some one save my grandchild. 

976
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,416
 Save. Save. Save. 

977
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,625
 What happened to my, Grandson? 

978
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:55,958
 Save him. Sir. 

979
01:13:56,958 --> 01:13:58,958
 Quickly sir. Quickly sir. 

980
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:02,291
 Hey, this jeep is not for servants. 

981
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:03,500
 It is for the bosses. 

982
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:04,500
 You stand aside from my way. 

983
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:07,708
You will stand aside. I have to take this Jeep for, Anju. 

984
01:14:07,916 --> 01:14:09,291
She goes for long rides in this, at this time. 

985
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:14,000
Tell her walking is better for her health. 

986
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,875
That two piece servant has that much courage? 

987
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,291
 And he does not obey my orders? 

988
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:30,208
This whip, which makes the animal obey.. 

989
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:33,166
..will now peel his skin and show him who he really is. 

990
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:14,208
You two bit man, I think you have forgotten that.. 

991
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:17,291
..this is not your city, but my property. 

992
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:21,958
 And you are my servant. 

993
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,666
And you took my jeep without my orders? 

994
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,416
Now this whip will you your real status. 

995
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:46,541
You proud, girl. You will show me who I am? 

996
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,375
 I will show you who you are. 

997
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:53,208
The wealth you are so proud of, is the result of.. 

998
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:57,041
..work of workers like us. This wealth is created by us. 

999
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:59,458
And with this wealth you rich people have made.. 

1000
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:02,333
..these Bungalows. You made your property. 

1001
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,291
 And made this tin box of a jeep. 

1002
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:09,458
My heart feels like making your fair skin in such a way.. 

1003
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:13,000
..that another girl who looks at you will never dare.. 

1004
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:15,375
 ..touch a whip again. 

1005
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,250
But as I am faithful to the my employer.. 

1006
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:23,541
..which has stopped my hands. Go. Go from here. 

1007
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:09,583
 Leave me. Leave me. 

1008
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,875
 Put me down. Put me down. 

1009
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:15,750
 I say leave me. I say leave me. 

1010
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,000
 Leave me. Leave me. 

1011
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:20,666
 Put me down. Put me down. 

1012
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,541
 I say leave me. I say leave me. 

1013
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:27,833
I will kill you. I will tell my, Uncle. Leave me. 

1014
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:35,958
Look, I am telling you now. You better leave me. 

1015
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,458
Or else my men will come here shortly.. 

1016
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,666
..and beat you so much that even your mother will.. 

1017
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,791
 ..not be able to recognize you. 

1018
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:45,458
Mothers, recognize their children in any condition. 

1019
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:49,416
But after today, you will learn how to recognize the humans. 

1020
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,791
 Understood? 

1021
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,333
 What are you doing? I say, you stop. 

1022
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:55,875
 See, if you even touch me.. 

1023
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:59,458
You gave me this wound. Now you will apply medicine.. 

1024
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:02,583
 ..on this wound with your own hands. 

1025
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:05,458
I will apply medicine on you? Are you in your senses? 

1026
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:06,791
 I have my senses intact. 

1027
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:09,125
Hence I only tell you to apply medicine. 

1028
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:14,416
Before I lose my senses and you everything of yours. 

1029
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:15,791
 Come on. 

1030
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:19,250
 Red chilly powder? 

1031
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:26,916
 Here is the medicine with my hands. 

1032
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,458
Now remember along with the wounds, this medicine too. 

1033
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,458
Such wounds and pain are a part of every day life.. 

1034
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:39,458
..of men like me. But today I will give you such a wound.. 

1035
01:18:39,541 --> 01:18:42,000
..which you will never forget for your whole life. 

1036
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:49,458
After today, whenever you see yourself on a mirror.. 

1037
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:53,750
..you will forget yourself and remember me. Me. 

1038
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:55,958
 Now get out. 

1039
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:03,458
After today, whenever you see yourself on a mirror.. 

1040
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:07,208
..you will forget yourself and remember me. Me. 

1041
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:09,875
 Me. Me. 

1042
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,416
 You fair body burns in the water. 

1043
01:19:39,416 --> 01:19:42,583
Now on this stones, I and you will have good time. 

1044
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:45,166
 Oh how I wish that I was this water. 

1045
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:48,083
 It will be short cut in long cut. 

1046
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:22,250
 Vikram, what is this nonsense? 

1047
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:25,458
This isn't any nonsense, it is my respect for you sir.. 

1048
01:20:25,541 --> 01:20:28,458
..that the eyes that ogle at the innocent women.. 

1049
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:31,208
..of the Banjaras, are okay tell now. 

1050
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:31,833
 What do you mean? 

1051
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:34,958
It means this. He is in cahoots with the, Banjaras. 

1052
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,083
 You villain. 

1053
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:39,000
Hey, you go. Sir, the Banjaras, had come again to loot us. 

1054
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:42,458
And this villain was with them. I courageously faced them.. 

1055
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:44,458
..and had caught one of their girls, so that.. 

1056
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:46,541
..I could present the truth in front of you. 

1057
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:49,708
But he got frightened, that his secret would now be revealed. 

1058
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:51,458
 Hence he accused me with this lie.. 

1059
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:53,750
..that I was trying to molest that Banjara, girl. 

1060
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:56,625
Sir, this villain is completely lying. 

1061
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,458
You better be in your limits, Vikram. 

1062
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:01,791
He is not the villain. The fault is in your blood. 

1063
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:05,000
The fault is not in my blood, but in your eyes, sir. 

1064
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:07,458
Which is why you are not able to see who is faithful to you.. 

1065
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:10,083
 ..and who is not. This villain.. 

1066
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:12,458
Vikram, before the time you abuse my so.. 

1067
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:15,458
..my manager, and I cross the limits of my patience.. 

1068
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:19,166
..go from here. I fire you here and now. 

1069
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,958
What you will remove me from the job? 

1070
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:23,875
 I myself kick this job of yours. 

1071
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:30,458
The boss who cannot see who is faithful and who is not.. 

1072
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:32,541
 ..he is not fit to be a boss. 

1073
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:39,625
Sir, Vicky your mother's letter has come from, Mumbai. 

1074
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:47,166
How dare you touch my mother's letter. 

1075
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:50,666
But on this the name of Vicky, is written. 

1076
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,041
 And your name is, Vikram. 

1077
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:55,750
Yes. My mother calls me by the name, Vicky. 

1078
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:58,541
 What is your mother's name? 

1079
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:00,000
 Shalini. 

1080
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:06,916
Oh, so this is the son of this old man. 

1081
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:10,583
You imposter, you have made my name yours. 

1082
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,000
Now you want to make my mother too yours? 

1083
01:22:13,916 --> 01:22:17,458
 Sir, Shalini is my mother's name. 

1084
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:20,458
You villain, how dare you take the name of my mother.. 

1085
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:22,750
..in your dirty mouth. I will pull your tongue. 

1086
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:24,333
 Leave my mother's letter. Leave. 

1087
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:33,291
 You villain I will not let you live. 

1088
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:36,375
 Stop it. I say stop it. Stop it. 

1089
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,333
 Mother. 

1090
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:10,833
Long cut in short cut dad. The son of Virendar is here. 

1091
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:13,458
What? You fool. Why didi you not crush him.. 

1092
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:15,875
 ..before he reached there? 

1093
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:17,708
I will do that too when the time comes. 

1094
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,250
And dad, have you taken care of that old woman or not? 

1095
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,250
That old woman has gone on a pilgrimage. 

1096
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:26,791
Make her pilgrimage into a funeral, dad. 

1097
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,666
That old woman must never reach here.. 

1098
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,041
 ..under any circumstance. 

1099
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:42,458
Please, stop Vikram, sir. We all are begging your pardon.. 

1100
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:44,458
..on behalf of the boss. Uncle, where one is not respected.. 

1101
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:46,250
 ..I cannot work there. 

1102
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:47,750
 But at least you can pardon me. 

1103
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,791
 As a boss, I did injustice to you. 

1104
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:59,458
And if you don't stop even after I ask your pardon.. 

1105
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:03,375
..then won't it be injustice on these poor people? 

1106
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:07,791
How much hope and love they have on you? 

1107
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:11,458
But, sir today the way you closed your eyes.. 

1108
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:13,458
..and insulted my faithfulness, and with knowing the truth.. 

1109
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:15,875
 ..you sided with him.. 

1110
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:19,583
You leave that. That was a compulsion on my part. 

1111
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:22,458
Such a compulsion which gets him entangled.. 

1112
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:24,458
..in justice, and injustice, and stops.. 

1113
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:26,291
 ..one from doing one's duty. 

1114
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,625
Vikram sir, when the boss is ashamed.. 

1115
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:32,791
..the servant's duty is to keep the honor of the boss intact. 

1116
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:38,583
Vikram, we all will await you at the farm, tomorrow at 9 AM. 

1117
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:51,458
What was the necessity for you to bow down.. 

1118
01:24:51,541 --> 01:24:52,833
 ..in front of that two bit servant? 

1119
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:55,916
What do you think, if he goes our work will stop? 

1120
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,791
 We will be destroyed, finished? 

1121
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:59,833
It would have happened so, if I had not stopped him yesterday 

1122
01:25:02,791 --> 01:25:04,791
Yesterday, a letter came on Vicky's name from Shalu. 

1123
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:06,125
 A letter? 

1124
01:25:06,208 --> 01:25:06,916
 Yes. 

1125
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:10,666
Before the time, Hariya gave that letter to, Hariya.. 

1126
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,666
..Vikram took it from his hand, saying.. 

1127
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:15,041
 ..that it was from his mother. 

1128
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:19,583
When I told him, Vicky's name is written on this.. 

1129
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:22,916
..he said yes, my mother too calls me by the name, Vicky. 

1130
01:25:25,291 --> 01:25:27,833
I felt as though a mountain fell on me. 

1131
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:29,875
 Then, Uncle we will do one thing. 

1132
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,458
We will find the address from this letter.. 

1133
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:33,000
 ..and get aunt here. 

1134
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:34,500
 Shalu, cannot come. 

1135
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:35,916
 Why, Uncle? 

1136
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,500
 She has gone on a Pilgrimage. 

1137
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:40,791
Then, Uncle, put all your troubles on me. 

1138
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:43,583
Before, Aunt comes back I will find who is the real son.. 

1139
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:47,041
..of the aunt, and who is the man who has come.. 

1140
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:50,791
..to deceive you and get hold of your wealth 

1141
01:25:56,291 --> 01:25:57,375
 You, get up. 

1142
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:05,708
 What is it? 

1143
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:07,583
I did not see anything special in you.. 

1144
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:10,208
..Either left, right, up or down, back or front. 

1145
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:11,666
 Then why did Anju baby say that.. 

1146
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,166
 ..I give the letter only to you. 

1147
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,583
 Anju's letter? Where is it? 

1148
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:15,583
 Here. 

1149
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:17,333
 You fool, it is here. 

1150
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:19,666
 My love. 

1151
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,500
 My love. 

1152
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:22,583
May be you don't know, that I like the red color.. 

1153
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:25,583
 ..more than anything in this world. 

1154
01:26:26,208 --> 01:26:29,000
Whenever I see your red drunken eyes, and.. 

1155
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,041
..the red tomato like, cheeks then the red blood.. 

1156
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:35,083
 ..in my heart, becomes more red. 

1157
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:39,958
My wish is that I see your redness, wearing red all over.. 

1158
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,583
..in the Lal Baug. And that I immerse my self.. 

1159
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:47,500
..in that redness and become red myself too. 

1160
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:51,416
 Awaiting you, only yours Anju. 

1161
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,666
 With you red. 

1162
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:01,583
Hey, Anju we are fully ready, but if he does.. 

1163
01:27:01,666 --> 01:27:04,625
 ..not come wearing red clothes then? 

1164
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:08,291
 Hey, Guddi. 

1165
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,000
 Yes. 

1166
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:10,833
 Won't he come? There he is, see. 

1167
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:23,916
 Banke Lal, see my wonder today. 

1168
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,291
 Your gait will change today. 

1169
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,000
When there happens a lot of fooling around. 

1170
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,916
 There he got it. 

1171
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:49,083
Go away. Save me, Go away. Save me, Go away. Save me, 

1172
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:55,500
Go away. Save me, Go away. Save me, Go away. Save me, 

1173
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:57,791
 Take this. 

1174
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:03,041
 Idea. Idea. 

1175
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,625
 Hide yourself. Hide yourself. 

1176
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:42,958
 Take this. 

1177
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,250
Take my red clothes. Save me. Remove red clothes. 

1178
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,291
 Save me. Now I will remove my pants. 

1179
01:28:48,375 --> 01:28:50,125
Now I will remove my pants. Red ones. 

1180
01:28:50,208 --> 01:28:51,291
 I am saved. 

1181
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Hey, my underpants too are red. Run. Idea. 

1182
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:01,916
 Come now. Come now. Come now. 

1183
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,083
You made my life difficult. Come now. 

1184
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:16,083
 Run. Run. Run. Run. 

1185
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:30,750
 The redness of Banke lal. 

1186
01:29:31,208 --> 01:29:34,083
 I am red from top to bottom. 

1187
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:41,083
The bull saw red and my underpants became red. 

1188
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:47,000
Ph, my love, where are you. My heart is yearning for you. 

1189
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:52,666
See the red marks on your body, now I hate red color. 

1190
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:56,500
Now even in my wedding I will not wear red dress. 

1191
01:29:56,583 --> 01:30:00,291
 Wedding? Whose wedding? 

1192
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:02,041
 Yours and mine. Who else? 

1193
01:30:02,791 --> 01:30:04,000
 Ours? 

1194
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:05,125
 Yes, my love. 

1195
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:06,666
Actually, our wedding has taken place.. 

1196
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,083
 ..in our previous birth. 

1197
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:10,583
And our divine love of this birth should have.. 

1198
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:12,541
 ..the stamp of wedding, isn't it? 

1199
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:15,125
 I have already talked to, Uncle. 

1200
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:21,041
You talk to my in laws, I mean your parents. 

1201
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,208
 And call them as soon as possible. 

1202
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:25,666
So that the talks of our wedding take place. 

1203
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,750
Then this wedding can never take place.. 

1204
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:31,125
..because my father can never come to talk about wedding. 

1205
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:33,500
 Can't come, but why? 

1206
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:36,541
Because for me my father is dead for me. 

1207
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,583
And if at all there is any one for me, then.. 

1208
01:30:40,666 --> 01:30:42,208
 ..that is only my mother. 

1209
01:30:42,708 --> 01:30:44,708
 Then call your mother. 

1210
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,666
 Mother? 

1211
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:49,833
 Yes, mother. 

1212
01:30:52,708 --> 01:30:56,125
I can make you meet my mother right now. 

1213
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,166
 Then do that. 

1214
01:30:58,458 --> 01:30:59,666
 Then come. 

1215
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:07,250
 Oh, oh. Come. 

1216
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:15,791
 Where is she? 

1217
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:19,583
 Now I will make you both meet. Come. 

1218
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:27,583
 This is my mother. 

1219
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:39,958
Mother. Mother. Mother. See who has come to meet you. 

1220
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:45,750
Your would be daughter-in-law. Mother, bless her. 

1221
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,166
That she live long and give you children. 

1222
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,666
 Anju. 

1223
01:31:52,208 --> 01:31:57,666
She is gone. Getting me beaten by a bull. 

1224
01:31:57,750 --> 01:32:00,583
By throwing the trap of love, she wanted to know.. 

1225
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:02,250
 ..my real details. 

1226
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:06,583
But I too am long cut in short cut, red among reds.. 

1227
01:32:06,666 --> 01:32:10,666
..best cheater, the god of death, oh I am torn. 

1228
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:17,541
 Destruction. Destruction. - No. 

1229
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:37,666
 No. Don't. 

1230
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:42,666
 No. No. No. No. 

1231
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:43,958
 Bhairav. 

1232
01:33:47,833 --> 01:33:49,708
 What justice is this, Sardar? 

1233
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:51,416
 The crime is done by some one and.. 

1234
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,375
 ..some one else is being punished. 

1235
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:53,166
 Who are you? 

1236
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:57,166
 Sardar, he is the manager of Rajpal. 

1237
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:05,500
It is good, manager that you yourself came here. 

1238
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:07,625
 No. 

1239
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:14,125
If you can save yourself from Bhairav's destruction.. 

1240
01:34:14,208 --> 01:34:16,791
 ..then do so. Here. 

1241
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,583
 No one interferes. 

1242
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:27,791
 Stop it, Bhairav. 

1243
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:28,958
 Stand aside, Gauri. 

1244
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,125
The hands that raise against your honor.. 

1245
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:33,208
..is not only just, but also my religion. 

1246
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:34,291
 No, Bhairav, no. 

1247
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:36,125
These are not the hands that was raised against.. 

1248
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:38,125
..Gauri's honor. These are those hands.. 

1249
01:35:38,208 --> 01:35:41,958
..that saved your, Gauri from that demon. 

1250
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:48,083
 No. What I was going to do? 

1251
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:52,083
The hands I have to kiss, I went to cut those very hands. 

1252
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:53,416
 No. 

1253
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:59,125
Sir, cut of my hands. I should have put garlands.. 

1254
01:35:59,208 --> 01:36:01,583
..with these hands, and I went to beat you.. 

1255
01:36:01,666 --> 01:36:03,791
 ..with those very hands? Kill me. 

1256
01:36:04,416 --> 01:36:08,250
Life for life. Dishonor for dishonor. 

1257
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:10,500
 This is your policy of your, Kabila. 

1258
01:36:11,416 --> 01:36:15,291
Love for love, and friendship for friendship.. 

1259
01:36:15,375 --> 01:36:16,833
 ..this is my policy. 

1260
01:36:23,583 --> 01:36:27,000
 No, no. He cannot be any deceiver.. 

1261
01:36:27,041 --> 01:36:29,083
..that has come here for, Uncle's wealth. 

1262
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:31,125
The one who fights for Gauri's honor.. 

1263
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:35,125
..and savior of my life, cannot be a thief of wealth.. 

1264
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:37,791
 ..but can be only a thief of hearts. 

1265
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,541
But Bhairav, our revenge is not yet complete. 

1266
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:44,750
Till the time, the one who is tried to molest, our Gauri.. 

1267
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:46,791
..till then this girl will remain with us. 

1268
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:50,833
Sardar, I saved the honor of Bhairav's fiancé. 

1269
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:53,041
 And you will hold my fiancé? 

1270
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:55,625
 What your fiancé? 

1271
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:57,375
 Yes, Bhairav. 

1272
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:05,875
The fiancé of the one who saves the honor.. 

1273
01:37:05,958 --> 01:37:09,541
..of Bhairav's, fiancé is Bhairav's sister. 

1274
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:11,541
 Gauri, go and free my sister. 

1275
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:12,708
 Yes. 

1276
01:37:24,666 --> 01:37:25,833
 Okay. 

1277
01:37:27,958 --> 01:37:30,750
Here brother, you can take your fiancé and go. 

1278
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:36,208
Not like that. There is a rule in this Kabila.. 

1279
01:37:36,291 --> 01:37:39,875
..that the boy lifts his fiancé in his own hands. 

1280
01:37:39,958 --> 01:37:42,250
Yes, sir. This is the rule in this, Kabila. 

1281
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:44,875
 Think, or else leave her here. 

1282
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,833
 Destruction. 

1283
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:23,958
Oh, I traveled in trains, planes, cars.. 

1284
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,500
..but I never enjoyed any travel, that I am enjoying.. 

1285
01:38:27,583 --> 01:38:32,958
..in your arms. What fiancé? Are you enjoying? 

1286
01:38:35,333 --> 01:38:38,666
 Ouch. Hard hearted man. 

1287
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,333
See, madam this road goes straight to your estate. 

1288
01:38:43,541 --> 01:38:46,958
Now sit on your horse, and it will take you to your estate. 

1289
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,750
 Understood? Good bye. 

1290
01:38:54,125 --> 01:38:55,875
 Hey, where are you going? 

1291
01:38:57,166 --> 01:38:59,250
 He is an understanding animal. 

1292
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:02,000
He does not want come between lovers. 

1293
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:05,125
Madam, this place is full of poisonous.. 

1294
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:08,958
..and dangerous animals. If something bites.. 

1295
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,416
 ..then you will die. 

1296
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,125
The one who is bitten by the most poisonous thing.. 

1297
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:16,875
..then nothing else will work on that person. 

1298
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:18,250
 What did you say? 

1299
01:39:18,333 --> 01:39:19,583
 You have given the wound. 

1300
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:22,791
 Now give the medicine too for it. 

1301
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:26,333
Medicine? What medicine? I don't have any medicine. 

1302
01:39:26,416 --> 01:39:27,875
 Really? You don't have? 

1303
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:31,000
Yes. I said I don't have. Strange girl. 

1304
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:39,958
"Friend we have started talking with our eyes." 

1305
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,541
"Friend we have started talking with our eyes." 

1306
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:52,791
"we have started loving, and acknowledging." 

1307
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:59,416
"dear we have started accepting the heartaches." 

1308
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:06,041
"Friend we have started talking with our eyes." 

1309
01:41:06,125 --> 01:41:12,583
"Friend we have started talking with our eyes." 

1310
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:19,000
"we have started loving, and acknowledging." 

1311
01:41:19,083 --> 01:41:26,416
"dear we have started accepting the heartaches." 

1312
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:02,125
"Take my salutes, the messages of my heart.." 

1313
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:05,000
 "..oh my dear, my better half." 

1314
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:11,416
"there is shade and sun, I see you wherever I look." 

1315
01:42:14,916 --> 01:42:18,125
"Take my salutes, the messages of my heart.." 

1316
01:42:18,208 --> 01:42:21,375
 "..oh my dear, my better half." 

1317
01:42:21,458 --> 01:42:27,750
"there is shade and sun, I see you wherever I look." 

1318
01:42:27,833 --> 01:42:34,458
"Your eyes stole my heart, and your style beat me hard." 

1319
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:41,208
"Before your faithfulness, I lost my heart to you." 

1320
01:42:41,291 --> 01:42:47,583
"You made my garden of desires bloom." 

1321
01:42:47,666 --> 01:42:53,791
"we have started loving, and acknowledging." 

1322
01:42:53,875 --> 01:43:00,583
"dear we have started accepting the heartaches." 

1323
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:23,500
"Do you know what my state is and my life is.." 

1324
01:43:23,583 --> 01:43:26,625
 "..without you, oh my dear." 

1325
01:43:26,708 --> 01:43:30,125
"you are near me, I always think of you.." 

1326
01:43:30,208 --> 01:43:33,166
"..you are the queen of my heart, my dear." 

1327
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:39,791
"Do you know what my state is and my life is.." 

1328
01:43:39,875 --> 01:43:42,916
 "..without you, oh my dear." 

1329
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,291
"you are near me, I always think of you.." 

1330
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:49,541
"..you are the queen of my heart, my dear." 

1331
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:56,208
"Whenever I think of you I lose my mind." 

1332
01:43:56,291 --> 01:43:59,125
"the exchange of hearts is madness.." 

1333
01:43:59,208 --> 01:44:02,708
 "..someone explain this to me." 

1334
01:44:02,791 --> 01:44:09,125
"You come to see me even in my dreams, in the nights." 

1335
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:14,958
"we have started loving, and acknowledging." 

1336
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:22,000
"dear we have started accepting the heartaches." 

1337
01:44:22,333 --> 01:44:28,875
"Friend we have started talking with our eyes." 

1338
01:44:28,958 --> 01:44:35,500
"Friend we have started talking with our eyes." 

1339
01:44:35,583 --> 01:44:41,875
"we have started loving, and acknowledging." 

1340
01:44:41,958 --> 01:44:48,625
"dear we have started accepting the heartaches." 

1341
01:44:48,708 --> 01:44:54,416
"we have started loving, and acknowledging." 

1342
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:01,291
"dear we have started accepting the heartaches." 

1343
01:45:11,083 --> 01:45:14,125
 Boss, see. Anju baby has come. 

1344
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:17,750
Dear. - Uncle. Oh, Uncle. 

1345
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:19,625
Thank God, countless times. As He saved.. 

1346
01:45:19,708 --> 01:45:23,125
..my daughter from the clutches of death, safe & sound. 

1347
01:45:23,208 --> 01:45:25,625
Uncle, the one who got me out from the clutches of death.. 

1348
01:45:25,708 --> 01:45:27,625
..and the giver of gift of life, is him. 

1349
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:33,583
Sir, Vikram it looks like you had to fight long and hard.. 

1350
01:45:33,666 --> 01:45:36,833
..to save, Anju baby. See your lips are cut. 

1351
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:45,833
But it does not seems to have been caused by some arms.. 

1352
01:45:45,916 --> 01:45:47,375
 ..but by something else. 

1353
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:51,083
Yes, a honeybee bit me in the jungle. 

1354
01:45:51,666 --> 01:45:53,625
 Hey, honeybees are very poisonous. 

1355
01:45:53,708 --> 01:45:54,833
 Stay away from them. 

1356
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:02,750
Vikram, this is second time you have done a favor for me. 

1357
01:46:04,375 --> 01:46:07,916
 Servants don't do favors. 

1358
01:46:08,666 --> 01:46:10,916
They only do their duty for the salary given. 

1359
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:14,833
 But the employers too have a duty.. 

1360
01:46:14,916 --> 01:46:17,833
..that they shouldn't see lie and truth with compulsion.. 

1361
01:46:17,916 --> 01:46:20,166
..but weigh it on the balance of justice. 

1362
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:22,208
 My mother has taught me this. 

1363
01:46:36,041 --> 01:46:37,375
 Vikram. 

1364
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:40,041
Sir, Sardar, it is you? Anything special? 

1365
01:46:40,125 --> 01:46:43,833
Come, the things you said yesterday.. 

1366
01:46:43,916 --> 01:46:45,125
 ..have opened my eyes. 

1367
01:46:45,625 --> 01:46:48,666
So today I have come today to do justice to you. 

1368
01:46:49,875 --> 01:46:52,041
 From today, you won't such work. 

1369
01:46:52,666 --> 01:46:55,583
Instead you will do the cash dealing work of, Rajpal estate. 

1370
01:46:58,083 --> 01:47:00,833
Go right now to the town, and get 25 lakhs.. 

1371
01:47:00,916 --> 01:47:02,708
 ..payment from Super tea. 

1372
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:06,125
But, sir such a big responsibility on me? 

1373
01:47:06,416 --> 01:47:08,833
 Has you mother not taught you this.. 

1374
01:47:08,916 --> 01:47:10,833
..that not to question your elders decision.. 

1375
01:47:10,916 --> 01:47:13,666
 ..but just obey them. 

1376
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,250
 As you wish sir. 

1377
01:47:29,083 --> 01:47:32,208
At last it is clear that blood is thicker than water. 

1378
01:47:35,458 --> 01:47:37,833
Before the father and son's blood shows.. 

1379
01:47:37,916 --> 01:47:41,833
..some other colors, color the land of the father.. 

1380
01:47:41,916 --> 01:47:47,541
..with the blood of the son. Kill that man. Finish him. 

1381
01:48:23,625 --> 01:48:26,000
Brothers what is matter, clear the road. 

1382
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:29,333
Sir, there is nothing special about this. 

1383
01:48:29,958 --> 01:48:31,666
 What is there to hide from you? 

1384
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:34,666
Ultimately it is you who will decide. 

1385
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:37,000
 Decision? What decision? 

1386
01:48:37,041 --> 01:48:41,916
The thing sir, is you are going to die alone. 

1387
01:48:42,416 --> 01:48:44,708
 We are four of us to do that. 

1388
01:48:44,791 --> 01:48:46,083
 I see. 

1389
01:48:46,166 --> 01:48:48,333
This Gujarathi, brother says that he alone is.. 

1390
01:48:48,416 --> 01:48:50,416
 ..enough to kill you. 

1391
01:48:51,125 --> 01:48:53,458
First he will hit you in the stomach.. 

1392
01:48:53,541 --> 01:48:58,875
..make you unconscious, and then he will finish you. 

1393
01:48:58,958 --> 01:49:02,833
Now you tell me, sir is there anything lacking in my plan? 

1394
01:49:04,416 --> 01:49:06,833
Now this Maharashtrian, brother says.. 

1395
01:49:06,916 --> 01:49:10,833
..if I break your limbs, then won't you.. 

1396
01:49:10,916 --> 01:49:13,416
 ..become unconscious? Tell me. 

1397
01:49:13,833 --> 01:49:15,833
 And the Tamil, brother says.. 

1398
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:18,833
..all the intestines will come out in one stroke. 

1399
01:49:18,916 --> 01:49:20,833
 I will stab you with my knife. 

1400
01:49:20,916 --> 01:49:25,041
Yes, looks like the matter is of the whole of India. 

1401
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:29,541
There should be no injustice in decision with any one.. 

1402
01:49:29,625 --> 01:49:33,250
..hence, every one has to be tested first. 

1403
01:49:34,791 --> 01:49:40,416
 Brother, you tell me that .. 

1404
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:43,125
..you will catch me, this way. 

1405
01:49:44,166 --> 01:49:47,666
And will box me in my stomach, this way? 

1406
01:49:50,541 --> 01:49:54,583
 Save me. Save me. Save me. 

1407
01:49:54,666 --> 01:49:59,541
 Don't hit me. I am dead. 

1408
01:50:03,875 --> 01:50:05,166
 He has failed in the test. 

1409
01:50:06,791 --> 01:50:14,000
What you Kolhapuri, you said that you would cut my limbs. 

1410
01:50:17,083 --> 01:50:22,833
 Mother, my head, legs. Head legs. 

1411
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:30,000
 Head legs. Head legs. Head legs. 

1412
01:50:33,208 --> 01:50:36,000
 He too failed. Aunt's leg. 

1413
01:50:37,083 --> 01:50:39,875
Come I will finish you. I won't leave you. 

1414
01:50:46,166 --> 01:50:48,291
 You came to stab me with a knife? 

1415
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:49,458
 No sir. 

1416
01:50:49,541 --> 01:50:51,750
 You were going to kill me. 

1417
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:03,291
 Rascal. You came to hit me? 

1418
01:51:03,375 --> 01:51:04,750
 No sir. 

1419
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,625
 Mother. 

1420
01:51:13,666 --> 01:51:17,291
 Brother, here hold your knife. 

1421
01:51:18,208 --> 01:51:21,916
I have dealt with your friends. Now what to do with you? 

1422
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,916
 See, son what I will do. 

1423
01:52:13,208 --> 01:52:15,916
 Sir, here is your money. 

1424
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,291
 Okay, good. 

1425
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,208
How did you get this wound? Nothing sir. 

1426
01:52:24,291 --> 01:52:26,208
 I met some goons on the way. 

1427
01:52:26,875 --> 01:52:30,500
 Anyway, you count your money. 

1428
01:52:31,541 --> 01:52:33,458
 I am counting your favors. 

1429
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,833
I am sure you must have had some blood relation.. 

1430
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:38,958
 ..with me, in some of your births. 

1431
01:52:40,333 --> 01:52:42,958
It is why you save me time and again. 

1432
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,375
 Go and put medicine on your wounds. 

1433
01:52:49,291 --> 01:52:54,583
I don't know why, you are wounded and I feel pained. 

1434
01:52:54,666 --> 01:52:58,291
 Sir, the kindness of the employer.. 

1435
01:52:58,375 --> 01:53:01,541
..is the biggest medicine for a servants wounds. 

1436
01:53:02,666 --> 01:53:04,166
 Mother has taught me this. 

1437
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:20,000
 Vikram, you are alright, isn't it? 

1438
01:53:22,666 --> 01:53:24,833
The man whose work is to protect others.. 

1439
01:53:24,916 --> 01:53:27,208
 ..knows how to protect himself. 

1440
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:30,833
You mad girl, the people who have true love.. 

1441
01:53:30,916 --> 01:53:33,375
 ..they have, God with them. 

1442
01:53:34,333 --> 01:53:35,833
 If something had happened to you.. 

1443
01:53:35,916 --> 01:53:38,000
 ..then I would have my life. 

1444
01:53:38,416 --> 01:53:43,000
No dear, don't ever talk again of taking your life. 

1445
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,958
My life is in your life. If this is there, then Vikram, is there. 

1446
01:53:49,208 --> 01:53:51,583
And if this is not there, then Vikram, too is not there. 

1447
01:53:51,666 --> 01:53:52,708
 Vikram. 

1448
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,041
 Destruction, Destruction, 

1449
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:08,708
Destruction, to those cast evil eyes on.. 

1450
01:54:08,791 --> 01:54:11,750
 ..this beautiful couple. 

1451
01:54:12,333 --> 01:54:13,833
 Hey, Bhairav you are here? 

1452
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:17,500
Why not, brother? Today we both are getting married. 

1453
01:54:17,583 --> 01:54:19,833
But I too have told, Bhairav clearly, that.. 

1454
01:54:19,916 --> 01:54:21,833
..if brother, Vikram does not shoulder my palanquin.. 

1455
01:54:21,916 --> 01:54:23,583
 ..then I won't sit in it. 

1456
01:54:23,666 --> 01:54:24,833
Hey, what only shoulder, I will come to reach you.. 

1457
01:54:24,916 --> 01:54:26,750
 ..up to his house. 

1458
01:54:26,833 --> 01:54:30,833
No. I won't allow her palanquin to enter my house.. 

1459
01:54:30,916 --> 01:54:37,791
..if my younger sister does not come along. Destruction. 

1460
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:40,041
 She felt shy. 

1461
01:54:44,791 --> 01:54:46,041
 What are you saying? 

1462
01:54:46,375 --> 01:54:47,833
 This is true. 

1463
01:54:47,916 --> 01:54:49,833
Vikram, is a traitor. He is in cahoots with your enemies.. 

1464
01:54:49,916 --> 01:54:53,666
..the Banjaras. And I had told this many times to you. 

1465
01:54:53,875 --> 01:54:56,541
 But, you did not believe me. 

1466
01:54:56,958 --> 01:54:59,833
And the result, is he has trapped Anju.. 

1467
01:54:59,916 --> 01:55:01,583
 ..in his love trap. 

1468
01:55:01,833 --> 01:55:04,583
 And now he is with our enemies.. 

1469
01:55:04,666 --> 01:55:07,000
..celebrating the success of his plans. 

1470
01:55:39,083 --> 01:55:45,666
 "Oh, mother. Oh, mother. " 

1471
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:49,625
"Oh, my adulthood has started troubling me." 

1472
01:55:49,708 --> 01:55:53,333
"My heart is not under my full control." 

1473
01:55:53,416 --> 01:55:56,916
"Oh, my adulthood has started troubling me." 

1474
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,333
"My heart is not under my full control." 

1475
01:56:00,541 --> 01:56:03,791
 "My steps are going astray." 

1476
01:56:04,083 --> 01:56:07,458
 "my heart started singing." 

1477
01:56:07,541 --> 01:56:10,875
 "My steps are going astray." 

1478
01:56:10,958 --> 01:56:13,500
 "my heart started singing." 

1479
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:21,416
"As you made me so restless, so I gave my heart to you." 

1480
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:28,375
"As you made me so restless, so I gave my heart to you." 

1481
01:56:28,458 --> 01:56:32,000
 "My steps are going astray." 

1482
01:56:32,083 --> 01:56:35,416
 "my heart started singing." 

1483
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:38,750
 "My steps are going astray." 

1484
01:56:38,833 --> 01:56:41,833
 "my heart started singing." 

1485
01:57:17,583 --> 01:57:19,375
 "Oh, mother. Oh, mother. " 

1486
01:57:20,916 --> 01:57:22,541
 "Oh, mother. Oh, mother. " 

1487
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:35,000
"My heart started beating faster in my chest." 

1488
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:41,125
"I have started getting lost in your dreams." 

1489
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:48,208
"My heart started beating faster in my chest." 

1490
01:57:48,875 --> 01:57:55,416
"I have started getting lost in your dreams." 

1491
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,166
 "I will tell the whole world." 

1492
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:02,625
 "that I too am mad after you." 

1493
01:58:02,708 --> 01:58:06,416
 "You hide me in your eyelids." 

1494
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:10,291
 "I am the target of your eyes." 

1495
01:58:13,375 --> 01:58:17,000
"Oh, my adulthood has started troubling me." 

1496
01:58:17,083 --> 01:58:20,583
"My heart is not under my full control." 

1497
01:58:20,666 --> 01:58:23,791
 "My steps are going astray." 

1498
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,458
 "my heart started singing." 

1499
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:30,666
 "My steps are going astray." 

1500
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:33,916
 "my heart started singing." 

1501
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:30,625
 "Oh, my dear, come into my arms." 

1502
01:59:30,708 --> 01:59:36,250
"Now my heart says don't trouble me now." 

1503
01:59:37,458 --> 01:59:43,625
 "Oh, my dear, come into my arms." 

1504
01:59:44,291 --> 01:59:49,666
"Now my heart says don't trouble me now." 

1505
01:59:51,208 --> 01:59:54,500
 "Your songs are on my lips." 

1506
01:59:54,583 --> 01:59:58,208
 "Your stories are in my talks." 

1507
01:59:58,291 --> 02:00:01,500
 "Your hands are very fragrant." 

1508
02:00:01,583 --> 02:00:05,500
 "My adulthood is just for you." 

1509
02:00:08,166 --> 02:00:15,416
"As you made me so restless, so I gave my heart to you." 

1510
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:22,500
"As you made me so restless, so I gave my heart to you." 

1511
02:00:22,583 --> 02:00:25,750
 "My steps are going astray." 

1512
02:00:25,833 --> 02:00:28,791
 "My heart started singing." 

1513
02:01:03,416 --> 02:01:06,791
Uncle, you have not gone to sleep till now? 

1514
02:01:08,541 --> 02:01:12,583
When a daughter makes merry with he father's enemies.. 

1515
02:01:12,666 --> 02:01:15,750
..then that father gets sleep with a lot of difficulty. 

1516
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:19,083
But, Uncle those, Banjaras are not out enemies any more. 

1517
02:01:19,166 --> 02:01:21,625
 My fate is my enemy, dear. 

1518
02:01:22,291 --> 02:01:24,916
I got my son after a long time, yet I can't call him son. 

1519
02:01:25,666 --> 02:01:28,958
 The one whom my daughter loves.. 

1520
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,083
..she cannot say whether her way will end.. 

1521
02:01:32,166 --> 02:01:34,958
..in a beautiful place or a dangerous pit. 

1522
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Uncle, as per the knowledge that you gave me.. 

1523
02:01:38,083 --> 02:01:40,833
..based on that I assure you that your girl will.. 

1524
02:01:40,916 --> 02:01:44,083
 ..never walk on such a path which.. 

1525
02:01:44,166 --> 02:01:46,416
 ..will end in a dangerous pit. 

1526
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:50,583
Mine or you heart can't decide that dear. 

1527
02:01:51,041 --> 02:01:52,416
Only the time that comes will decide that. 

1528
02:01:54,083 --> 02:01:59,916
I am afraid that if you go very far in the road of your love.. 

1529
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,625
..that if you have return you will not be able to do so. 

1530
02:02:06,583 --> 02:02:09,708
 Hence, even now you have time. 

1531
02:02:09,916 --> 02:02:11,750
 Pull back your steps. 

1532
02:02:12,291 --> 02:02:15,000
I am not saying that, Vikram is not a good boy. 

1533
02:02:15,625 --> 02:02:18,416
But my problem is this dear, that if he is not my blood.. 

1534
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:20,166
..and he is the enemy of my family, then? 

1535
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:22,333
Then I will strangle my love for him. 

1536
02:02:26,833 --> 02:02:30,000
I will forget that I ever loved, Vikram. 

1537
02:02:30,875 --> 02:02:35,083
 Enough, dear. Only a few days more. 

1538
02:02:35,958 --> 02:02:38,083
As soon as Shalu, returns from the pilgrimage.. 

1539
02:02:38,166 --> 02:02:40,750
 ..we will know who is the real son. 

1540
02:02:41,833 --> 02:02:44,708
 Vikram, or Vicky. 

1541
02:02:57,875 --> 02:03:01,416
Oh God, you know very well why I have come.. 

1542
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:04,250
..on the pilgrimage of 14 holy places. 

1543
02:03:05,375 --> 02:03:06,666
I hear that no one goes back empty handed.. 

1544
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:08,291
 ..from your house. 

1545
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:12,083
Then please put some alms in my lap.. 

1546
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:15,833
..that when I return back, the wall of hatred.. 

1547
02:03:15,916 --> 02:03:19,791
..between the father and son, falls down for ever. 

1548
02:03:19,875 --> 02:03:23,583
But you will not be alive to see all that. 

1549
02:04:17,416 --> 02:04:20,083
Villain, aren't you the one who set fire.. 

1550
02:04:20,166 --> 02:04:23,458
..to the happiness of my family and burnt it? 

1551
02:04:23,541 --> 02:04:27,791
 Yes. You escaped that day. 

1552
02:04:27,875 --> 02:04:29,666
 But you won't escape today. 

1553
02:05:35,041 --> 02:05:37,750
Don't get shocked, son and listen to a good news. 

1554
02:05:38,041 --> 02:05:42,083
I have parceled the biggest stumbling block.. 

1555
02:05:42,166 --> 02:05:44,291
 ..on our road to success, to hell. 

1556
02:05:44,375 --> 02:05:46,000
You could tell that on the phone too. 

1557
02:05:46,041 --> 02:05:47,791
There was not need for you to come here. 

1558
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,625
If any one sees both of us together.. 

1559
02:05:49,708 --> 02:05:51,875
..it will be long cut in short cut for both of us. 

1560
02:05:51,958 --> 02:05:56,041
Don't be afraid, son. I am your only father. 

1561
02:05:57,125 --> 02:06:00,041
I shoot and hit the target surely even with crooked arrows. 

1562
02:06:00,958 --> 02:06:03,166
 No one saw me coming here. 

1563
02:06:04,125 --> 02:06:08,375
But I saw everything. You laid the trap. 

1564
02:06:08,875 --> 02:06:12,125
But the crocodile is not fully trapped in it. 

1565
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:16,541
That is because the actual son of the crocodile has come here 

1566
02:06:17,375 --> 02:06:19,750
But be happy to note in this dad, that.. 

1567
02:06:19,833 --> 02:06:22,750
..the son still does not recognize the father. 

1568
02:06:24,708 --> 02:06:27,833
And the father is not able to make out till now.. 

1569
02:06:27,916 --> 02:06:32,000
 ..who is his real son. 

1570
02:06:32,083 --> 02:06:34,125
 Then I will do the good work. 

1571
02:06:34,208 --> 02:06:34,916
 What do you mean? 

1572
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,083
What I mean is so far I shot and hit the target.. 

1573
02:06:37,166 --> 02:06:42,000
..with crooked arrows. But today I will aim.. 

1574
02:06:42,041 --> 02:06:46,541
..surely with straight arrows at the final target. 

1575
02:06:47,666 --> 02:06:49,541
 - Greetings, sir. - Yes. Greetings. 

1576
02:06:49,625 --> 02:06:51,416
Has the Rajaram, company's trucks are loaded? 

1577
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:54,083
Yes, it is loaded, but we cannot send it. 

1578
02:06:54,166 --> 02:06:55,250
 Why? 

1579
02:06:55,333 --> 02:06:58,041
Because Vikram, is not here. He makes the challan. 

1580
02:06:58,125 --> 02:07:00,583
 No problem, I will make them. Come. 

1581
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:41,000
 Why are you suddenly sweating? 

1582
02:07:42,333 --> 02:07:45,083
This man, had come here in the morning here.. 

1583
02:07:45,166 --> 02:07:48,833
..to meet, Vikram. By looking at them talk.. 

1584
02:07:48,916 --> 02:07:51,208
..one could say that they father and son. 

1585
02:07:51,458 --> 02:07:56,166
After that, Vikram took him towards his cottage. Yes. 

1586
02:07:59,458 --> 02:08:01,083
 Long cut in short cut. 

1587
02:08:05,166 --> 02:08:06,666
 Yes, take this. 

1588
02:08:27,125 --> 02:08:29,083
 Son, Vikram just as we had planned.. 

1589
02:08:29,166 --> 02:08:32,083
..you have played all your hands successfully.. 

1590
02:08:32,166 --> 02:08:36,833
..and the best among them is to trap Virendar's foster.. 

1591
02:08:36,916 --> 02:08:40,958
..daughter in your love trap, but looks like.. 

1592
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,375
 ..his actual son too has come here. 

1593
02:08:43,875 --> 02:08:46,625
Hence you get married to, Anju at the earliest.. 

1594
02:08:46,708 --> 02:08:49,458
..so that immediately thereafter we can finish off, Virendar.. 

1595
02:08:49,541 --> 02:08:52,083
..and make all his wealth on our name. 

1596
02:08:52,166 --> 02:08:54,291
 Your father, Gajendar Singh. 

1597
02:08:58,666 --> 02:09:00,000
 Vikram. 

1598
02:09:15,041 --> 02:09:23,833
"I made you mine. I got you etched in my eyes." 

1599
02:09:24,458 --> 02:09:33,583
"I made you mine. I got you etched in my eyes." 

1600
02:09:33,666 --> 02:09:38,375
"Since the time I fell in love, I am far from everyone." 

1601
02:09:38,458 --> 02:09:47,166
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1602
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:52,791
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1603
02:09:52,875 --> 02:10:01,958
"I made you mine. I got you etched in my eyes." 

1604
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:11,583
"I made you mine. I got you etched in my eyes." 

1605
02:10:11,666 --> 02:10:16,375
"Since the time I fell in love, I am far from everyone." 

1606
02:10:16,458 --> 02:10:25,208
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1607
02:10:25,291 --> 02:10:30,750
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1608
02:11:13,041 --> 02:11:17,791
"your fragrance is strong in my heart." 

1609
02:11:17,875 --> 02:11:22,875
"I am nothing without you, and you without me." 

1610
02:11:27,416 --> 02:11:32,208
"your fragrance is strong in my heart." 

1611
02:11:32,291 --> 02:11:36,666
"I am nothing without you, and you without me." 

1612
02:11:36,750 --> 02:11:41,458
 "We won't get angry on each other." 

1613
02:11:41,541 --> 02:11:46,083
"we will never separate from each other." 

1614
02:11:46,166 --> 02:11:50,708
 "On this world, my dear." 

1615
02:11:50,791 --> 02:11:59,958
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1616
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:04,708
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1617
02:12:39,333 --> 02:12:44,041
"My dreams and future are all depending on you." 

1618
02:12:44,125 --> 02:12:49,500
"Now I cannot stay without you any more." 

1619
02:12:52,666 --> 02:12:58,458
"My dreams and future are all depending on you." 

1620
02:12:58,541 --> 02:13:02,833
"Now I cannot stay without you any more." 

1621
02:13:02,916 --> 02:13:07,666
 "I will live and die only for you.." 

1622
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:12,458
"..now why should we fear the world." 

1623
02:13:12,541 --> 02:13:17,000
 "I will love you only all my life." 

1624
02:13:17,083 --> 02:13:26,083
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1625
02:13:26,166 --> 02:13:31,625
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1626
02:13:31,708 --> 02:13:41,166
"I made you mine. I got you etched in my eyes." 

1627
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:50,625
"I made you mine. I got you etched in my eyes." 

1628
02:13:50,708 --> 02:13:55,333
"Since the time I fell in love, I am far from everyone." 

1629
02:13:55,416 --> 02:14:04,125
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1630
02:14:04,208 --> 02:14:10,000
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1631
02:14:40,833 --> 02:14:45,041
 Vikram. Leave me. 

1632
02:14:45,125 --> 02:14:46,541
 Leave me, Uncle. 

1633
02:14:46,625 --> 02:14:51,708
 Vikram, no. Uncle, please. No. 

1634
02:14:52,125 --> 02:14:53,458
 Finish that fellow. 

1635
02:14:53,541 --> 02:14:56,833
 No. Leave me. 

1636
02:15:01,375 --> 02:15:05,083
 Vikram. Vikram. 

1637
02:15:41,708 --> 02:15:44,166
 Long cut in short cut 

1638
02:15:52,541 --> 02:15:54,291
 Lift him and throw him. 

1639
02:16:22,541 --> 02:16:26,000
Until today, I gave you what ever you asked for. 

1640
02:16:26,041 --> 02:16:28,000
 I did whatever you wanted. 

1641
02:16:28,083 --> 02:16:31,208
But, now you will do only what I want. 

1642
02:16:31,291 --> 02:16:34,166
Uncle, why don't you listen to what I say? 

1643
02:16:34,250 --> 02:16:37,000
You don't know, but Vikram, is your son. 

1644
02:16:37,041 --> 02:16:40,708
Your true son. He is your own flesh and blood. 

1645
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,875
 It is not you but your love talking. 

1646
02:16:42,958 --> 02:16:44,333
 You blind love is talking. 

1647
02:16:44,416 --> 02:16:45,916
 No, Uncle the truth is speaking. 

1648
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,458
If you want to know the truth, then see. 

1649
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:52,000
See, his father Gajendra Singh's letter. 

1650
02:16:52,791 --> 02:16:55,541
This reveals the plans that the father laid for us. 

1651
02:16:55,625 --> 02:16:57,541
That fellow not only lied to me, but he.. 

1652
02:16:57,625 --> 02:16:59,666
..made a false drama of love with you.. 

1653
02:16:59,750 --> 02:17:01,291
 ..to destroy me, fully. 

1654
02:17:01,375 --> 02:17:04,208
No Uncle, this is a move by your enemies.. 

1655
02:17:04,291 --> 02:17:07,125
..so that you will become an enemy to your own son. 

1656
02:17:07,208 --> 02:17:09,708
And the enemy will succeed in their plans. 

1657
02:17:09,791 --> 02:17:12,083
They would have definitely succeeded.. 

1658
02:17:12,166 --> 02:17:14,458
..if my eyes had not opened in the right time. 

1659
02:17:15,041 --> 02:17:17,791
You can become blind in love, Anju but not me. 

1660
02:17:18,416 --> 02:17:20,125
 Now only what I say will happen. 

1661
02:17:20,208 --> 02:17:22,458
 - Uncle. - Stand aside. 

1662
02:17:23,291 --> 02:17:28,750
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Please open the door, Uncle. 

1663
02:17:29,166 --> 02:17:32,541
Uncle, you don't know what mistake you are going to do. 

1664
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:35,500
 Uncle, please open the door. 

1665
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:49,500
 Sir, I did just as you said. 

1666
02:17:51,541 --> 02:17:55,250
 You have done your work, Vicky. 

1667
02:17:56,166 --> 02:17:59,833
 Now I too have to do my work. 

1668
02:18:00,125 --> 02:18:05,750
 Today I am going to reveal a truth.. 

1669
02:18:05,833 --> 02:18:09,041
that I had hidden till today from you. 

1670
02:18:09,125 --> 02:18:10,375
 Truth? 

1671
02:18:10,458 --> 02:18:15,666
It is this that the father whom you hate so much.. 

1672
02:18:15,750 --> 02:18:22,500
..that unfortunate father is none other than me. 

1673
02:18:22,583 --> 02:18:25,000
 Sir, you? 

1674
02:18:25,041 --> 02:18:29,666
Yes, son. Now your unfortunate father.. 

1675
02:18:29,750 --> 02:18:32,166
 ..is standing before you. 

1676
02:18:33,708 --> 02:18:36,041
 What ever punishment you want.. 

1677
02:18:36,125 --> 02:18:38,250
..you can give for the crime that are mine. 

1678
02:18:39,416 --> 02:18:44,625
Due to your hatred for me, I hid this truth from you. 

1679
02:18:44,708 --> 02:18:48,791
And I hated a father, who is an angel. 

1680
02:18:49,583 --> 02:18:50,666
 The one whose snap, I had hang in.. 

1681
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:52,125
 ..the temple of heart.. 

1682
02:18:52,208 --> 02:18:53,833
..the one whom I had to worship my whole life.. 

1683
02:18:53,916 --> 02:18:55,666
..the one whose blessings I had to take.. 

1684
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:59,250
..I was abusing that great man my whole life. 

1685
02:19:00,250 --> 02:19:01,500
 I should be ashamed of myself. 

1686
02:19:02,166 --> 02:19:05,666
Such a wicked son has no right to live in this world. 

1687
02:19:05,750 --> 02:19:06,833
 No right. 

1688
02:19:06,916 --> 02:19:08,458
 No, son. No. 

1689
02:19:11,333 --> 02:19:15,333
Son, our enemies don't have the right to live. 

1690
02:19:16,625 --> 02:19:19,041
The ones who separated us father and son. 

1691
02:19:19,125 --> 02:19:21,666
And again today, those same enemies.. 

1692
02:19:21,750 --> 02:19:23,458
..want to snatch everything from me.. 

1693
02:19:23,541 --> 02:19:24,625
 ..and finish me off. 

1694
02:19:27,250 --> 02:19:32,208
 And so son, I decided that I will.. 

1695
02:19:32,291 --> 02:19:35,875
 ..get you married to, Anju. 

1696
02:19:36,541 --> 02:19:40,000
And write all my wealth on your name.. 

1697
02:19:40,083 --> 02:19:44,250
..I will surrender myself to the police. 

1698
02:19:45,250 --> 02:19:49,208
But dad, if Anju does not agree then? 

1699
02:19:49,291 --> 02:19:53,500
If she values, her Uncles life more than her blind love.. 

1700
02:19:53,583 --> 02:19:57,458
..then she will definitely marry you. 

1701
02:19:57,833 --> 02:20:00,666
Today, either the fire for wedding you and her.. 

1702
02:20:00,750 --> 02:20:04,916
..will be lit, or my funeral pyre will be lit. 

1703
02:20:09,041 --> 02:20:10,541
 Cheers. Cheers. 

1704
02:20:11,625 --> 02:20:14,166
Very good dad. Your shot with crooked arrow.. 

1705
02:20:14,250 --> 02:20:16,666
..hit the target bulls eye and my thorn in the right place.. 

1706
02:20:16,750 --> 02:20:18,000
 ..wrapped up the whole thing. 

1707
02:20:18,041 --> 02:20:19,541
 No son, no. 

1708
02:20:22,333 --> 02:20:26,375
The revenge of my brother, which is burning.. 

1709
02:20:26,458 --> 02:20:35,083
..for last twenty years will cool only when Virendar.. 

1710
02:20:35,166 --> 02:20:41,000
..aka Rajpal's wealth is in my hands.. 

1711
02:20:41,041 --> 02:20:43,416
..and he himself is in the clutches of death. 

1712
02:20:43,500 --> 02:20:47,791
 Once this wedding is over.. 

1713
02:20:47,875 --> 02:20:49,625
 No, Pyarelal, no. 

1714
02:20:49,708 --> 02:20:51,750
This wedding should be stopped at any cost. 

1715
02:20:52,166 --> 02:20:55,625
In this not only my destruction but, Uncle too will be finished. 

1716
02:20:55,708 --> 02:20:57,666
 But, Anju baby now only Vikram.. 

1717
02:20:57,750 --> 02:20:59,750
 ..can stop this marriage. 

1718
02:21:00,333 --> 02:21:03,750
But at this time, I don't where or how he is. 

1719
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,666
My Vikram, wherever or however he is.. 

1720
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:09,375
..will definitely come to save me, Pyare. 

1721
02:21:10,041 --> 02:21:13,375
 But who will inform him, and how? 

1722
02:21:13,625 --> 02:21:16,875
You know that, Uncle has kept guards all around the house. 

1723
02:21:21,958 --> 02:21:23,000
 Sheru. 

1724
02:21:23,958 --> 02:21:26,958
Pyarelal, my Sheru will do this work. 

1725
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,583
Yes. - My Sheru, will inform him, Pyarelal. 

1726
02:21:32,916 --> 02:21:36,333
Sheru, Sheru, will you do my work, Sheru. 

1727
02:21:37,666 --> 02:21:40,166
 Will you get my, Vikram Sheru? 

1728
02:21:41,291 --> 02:21:42,833
 Go Sheru, Go Sheru, 

1729
02:21:42,916 --> 02:21:48,541
 Go Sheru, Go Sheru, 

1730
02:21:53,083 --> 02:21:55,541
 Go Sheru. 

1731
02:22:06,708 --> 02:22:11,666
 "Come my dear. Come my dear. " 

1732
02:22:12,166 --> 02:22:16,916
 "Come my dear. Come my dear. " 

1733
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:22,416
"This is the last moment, of my wait for you." 

1734
02:22:22,833 --> 02:22:28,166
"Listen to my restless beats of my heart." 

1735
02:22:28,250 --> 02:22:33,458
"Those promises and oaths should not break." 

1736
02:22:33,541 --> 02:22:38,833
"the rites of our love should not break." 

1737
02:22:38,916 --> 02:22:44,208
 "Come my dear. Come my dear. " 

1738
02:22:44,291 --> 02:22:49,666
 "Come my dear. Come my dear. " 

1739
02:23:33,375 --> 02:23:38,916
"Come and destroy all the villainy of the foes." 

1740
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:44,416
"show the world the strength of our love and affection." 

1741
02:23:49,958 --> 02:23:55,333
"Come and destroy all the villainy of the foes." 

1742
02:23:55,416 --> 02:24:00,750
"show the world the strength of our love and affection." 

1743
02:24:00,833 --> 02:24:06,000
"Both of my eyes are fixed on the road of your coming." 

1744
02:24:06,041 --> 02:24:11,458
"The foes should not win and even in death I will pray." 

1745
02:24:11,541 --> 02:24:17,000
"Those promises and oaths should not break." 

1746
02:24:17,041 --> 02:24:22,291
"the rites of our love should not break." 

1747
02:24:22,375 --> 02:24:27,291
 "Come my dear. Come my dear. " 

1748
02:24:27,375 --> 02:24:33,000
 "Come my dear. Come my dear. " 

1749
02:25:11,083 --> 02:25:16,500
"without you I will die stifled alone in my life." 

1750
02:25:16,583 --> 02:25:21,916
"In spite of my love for you, I am not able to meet you." 

1751
02:25:27,333 --> 02:25:32,708
"without you I will die stifled alone in my life." 

1752
02:25:32,791 --> 02:25:38,125
"In spite of my love for you, I am not able to meet you." 

1753
02:25:38,208 --> 02:25:43,375
"I think and get afraid that it should not get late." 

1754
02:25:43,458 --> 02:25:48,875
"The time and the will to come together should get lost." 

1755
02:25:48,958 --> 02:25:53,916
"Those promises and oaths should not break." 

1756
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:59,541
"the rites of our love should not break." 

1757
02:25:59,625 --> 02:26:04,541
 "Come my dear. Come my dear. " 

1758
02:26:04,625 --> 02:26:09,791
 "Come my dear. Come my dear. " 

1759
02:26:52,333 --> 02:26:55,166
 Hey, this is Sheru's neighing. 

1760
02:26:55,958 --> 02:26:58,875
 Sheru. Sheru. Sheru. Sheru. 

1761
02:26:58,958 --> 02:27:00,625
 Sheru. 

1762
02:27:09,333 --> 02:27:11,333
 Sheru. You are here? 

1763
02:27:13,041 --> 02:27:19,416
Sheru, you are crying? Tell me what is the matter? Tell me. 

1764
02:27:21,208 --> 02:27:23,583
 What is the matter, Sheru? Tell me. 

1765
02:27:25,375 --> 02:27:28,041
 Understood, surely my.. 

1766
02:27:28,125 --> 02:27:33,083
 Anju is in trouble. Inst it Sheru. 

1767
02:27:35,416 --> 02:27:36,666
Vikram, can shed blood for his master.. 

1768
02:27:36,750 --> 02:27:38,875
 ..being faithful to him. 

1769
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:43,833
But I cannot see, my Anju's tears. Come on, Sheru. 

1770
02:28:21,458 --> 02:28:23,208
 Let both of you be blessed. 

1771
02:28:32,208 --> 02:28:33,750
 Anju. 

1772
02:28:36,208 --> 02:28:39,666
Why are you all looking, before he sets foot in the wedding.. 

1773
02:28:39,750 --> 02:28:40,833
 ..shoot him dead. 

1774
02:28:40,916 --> 02:28:42,000
 No, stop. 

1775
02:28:42,541 --> 02:28:43,750
 No. 

1776
02:29:08,833 --> 02:29:10,458
 Run, Anju. Run. Run. 

1777
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,125
People get fed up and die. This I have heard. 

1778
02:29:25,208 --> 02:29:27,708
But such a wish for death, I am seeing for the first time. 

1779
02:29:27,791 --> 02:29:30,666
Sir, the decision of life and death is written by.. 

1780
02:29:30,750 --> 02:29:33,375
 ..the pen, of the Almighty. 

1781
02:29:33,458 --> 02:29:35,666
Not from the gun, of rich people like you. 

1782
02:29:36,125 --> 02:29:38,333
 Shoot me, sir. Shoot. 

1783
02:29:52,750 --> 02:29:53,750
 Mother. 

1784
02:29:54,125 --> 02:29:55,375
 Shalu. You? 

1785
02:29:56,291 --> 02:29:59,666
Yes. What a fate? For years I decorated.. 

1786
02:29:59,750 --> 02:30:02,750
..the togetherness of the father and son in my eyes. 

1787
02:30:03,208 --> 02:30:05,291
 Today I saw it, but just opposite. 

1788
02:30:05,708 --> 02:30:07,708
 A father is the enemy of his son? 

1789
02:30:11,041 --> 02:30:12,541
What? - Yes. 

1790
02:30:12,625 --> 02:30:15,750
He is your son, he is our flesh and blood. 

1791
02:30:22,166 --> 02:30:23,916
 What she says is correct, Virendar. 

1792
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:24,875
 Gajendra Singh? 

1793
02:30:24,958 --> 02:30:29,416
Yes. The guy who has become the groom is my son.. 

1794
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:32,541
 ..and not yours, Shakti Singh. 

1795
02:30:34,041 --> 02:30:35,125
 Villain? 

1796
02:30:35,208 --> 02:30:39,458
Not villain. We are the worst of the mankind and criminals. 

1797
02:30:39,875 --> 02:30:41,458
 We are dogs. 

1798
02:30:42,416 --> 02:30:44,666
So long cut in short cut, let us do what we intended to.. 

1799
02:30:44,750 --> 02:30:46,708
 ..after the wedding. 

1800
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:50,375
 I mean signing the property papers. 

1801
02:30:50,666 --> 02:30:53,208
 Do that work right now. Take this. 

1802
02:30:53,291 --> 02:30:54,458
 Never. 

1803
02:30:54,791 --> 02:30:57,750
Villains no plans of yours will work now. 

1804
02:30:57,833 --> 02:31:00,791
Not plans old man, bullets will fly now. Bullets. 

1805
02:31:01,625 --> 02:31:04,750
If you don't sign these papers, then your wife.. 

1806
02:31:04,833 --> 02:31:07,083
..who you got after such a long time, and the son whom.. 

1807
02:31:07,166 --> 02:31:10,125
..you were separated from, will be lost to you forever. 

1808
02:31:10,541 --> 02:31:13,791
Long cut in short cut, think about it. 

1809
02:32:20,208 --> 02:32:25,250
Nothing? You pauper. It will of use to you above. 

1810
02:32:26,083 --> 02:32:27,750
 What will you do when He asks you? 

1811
02:32:27,833 --> 02:32:28,958
 They ask for money in all the gates. 

1812
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,875
Nothing works without money, anywhere. 

1813
02:32:43,125 --> 02:32:44,583
 Rotten egg of a cockroach. 

1814
02:32:50,541 --> 02:32:56,041
This is the first I saw love in Kalu's eyes. 

1815
02:32:56,125 --> 02:32:58,291
 Hold me tight. Hold me tight. 

1816
02:33:06,583 --> 02:33:07,541
 Father. 

1817
02:33:07,625 --> 02:33:08,625
 Uncle. 

1818
02:33:08,708 --> 02:33:11,833
 No. son. Did you see? 

1819
02:33:12,250 --> 02:33:13,333
 Stand aside. 

1820
02:33:15,708 --> 02:33:17,875
If any one tries to come in between.. 

1821
02:33:17,958 --> 02:33:20,666
 ..then I will shoot this girl. 

1822
02:33:21,833 --> 02:33:23,333
 Shakti. Come on. 

1823
02:33:25,791 --> 02:33:26,958
Vikram. - Come. 

1824
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,083
Vikram. - Come. 

1825
02:33:28,166 --> 02:33:31,125
 No. Uncle. No. Uncle. 

1826
02:33:36,250 --> 02:33:39,875
Son, Vikram go and save the honor of the house. 

1827
02:33:39,958 --> 02:33:42,666
Vikram, for the destruction of these rats.. 

1828
02:33:42,750 --> 02:33:45,333
 ..Bhairav Singh is enough. 

1829
02:33:45,416 --> 02:33:46,666
 You go and save my sister. 

1830
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:48,375
 Go my son. Go. 

1831
02:33:56,666 --> 02:33:58,541
 Sheru. 

1832
02:34:09,833 --> 02:34:11,375
 Leave me. 

1833
02:34:14,250 --> 02:34:15,333
 Vikram. 

1834
02:34:16,708 --> 02:34:18,000
 Roast that villain. 

1835
02:34:18,041 --> 02:34:19,125
 Vikram. 

1836
02:34:41,708 --> 02:34:42,791
 Vikram. 

1837
02:35:08,291 --> 02:35:10,416
 No. No. 

1838
02:35:13,333 --> 02:35:14,458
 Vikram. 

1839
02:35:23,916 --> 02:35:26,958
Sheru, you take care of him, I will take care of the other. 

1840
02:36:00,125 --> 02:36:03,666
 Vikram, Vikram, brake has failed. 

1841
02:36:35,750 --> 02:36:45,083
"I made you mine. I got you etched in my eyes." 

1842
02:36:45,166 --> 02:36:54,208
"I made you mine. I got you etched in my eyes." 

1843
02:36:54,291 --> 02:36:59,000
"Since the time I fell in love, I am far from everyone." 

1844
02:36:59,041 --> 02:37:08,083
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1845
02:37:08,166 --> 02:37:13,291
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1846
02:37:13,375 --> 02:37:22,958
"I made you mine. I got you etched in my eyes." 

1847
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:31,791
"I made you mine. I got you etched in my eyes." 

1848
02:37:32,041 --> 02:37:36,708
"Since the time I fell in love, I am far from everyone." 

1849
02:37:36,791 --> 02:37:45,833
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything." 

1850
02:37:45,916 --> 02:37:51,375
"Oh, my dear, you are my everything."
