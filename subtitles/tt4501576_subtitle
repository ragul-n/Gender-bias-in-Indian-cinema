1
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,458
My greetings to all the residents.

2
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,375
Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,166
Hi.

4
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,458
My name is Mukhtiar Singh.

5
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,500
Neither am I a Sikh,
Christian, Hindu nor a Muslim.

6
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,458
Just a human being.

7
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:49,625
All I will say is that I am not
that good that I can be called god.

8
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,875
I am not that bad that
I can be called a devil.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I am not here to seek your vote.

10
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,041
I know I will get them.
- Yes.

11
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,708
You will have to vote for me.
- We will.

12
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:06,041
Friends, everyone remembers
what Mahatma Gandhi had said.

13
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,166
Speak no..
- Evil.

14
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,875
See no..
- Evil.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,833
Hear no..
- Evil.

16
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,666
Is that's what's happening?
- No.

17
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,750
It's just the opposite.
- Yes.

18
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,375
It's true, right? Then speak up.

19
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,375
It was Mahatma's dream..

20
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,458
Move aside! Give way!

21
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,625
After gaining independence..

22
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:26,708
Move aside! Give way!

23
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,791
Peace should be restored.
- Move aside! Give way!

24
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,833
I am here to fulfil his dream.

25
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,750
I will..
- Mr. Mukhtiar..

26
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,875
Calm.. calm down.

27
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,583
With that your speech ends.

28
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,625
Let's go to the police station.

29
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,416
We are here to arrest you.

30
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,750
Long live!
- Mukhtiar Singh!

31
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:44,791
What for?

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
The list of your crimes is long.

33
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,208
We will have time
when you get locked up.

34
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,458
We will let you know.

35
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,125
Something official has come up.

36
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,291
I'll be back soon.

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,250
Long live!
- Mukhtiar Singh!

38
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,375
Long live!
- Mukhtiar Singh!

39
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,250
Long live!
- Mukhtiar Singh!

40
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,750
Long live!
- Mukhtiar Singh!

41
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,500
Long live! - Mukhtiar Singh!
- Move aside! Give way!

42
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,750
Long live!
- Mukhtiar Singh!

43
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,791
Long live!
- Mukhtiar Singh!

44
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,958
Long live!
- Mukhtiar Singh!

45
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,583
S.P. Karan Singh.

46
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,041
Karan Singh, it's me, Dinanath.

47
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,291
Your men have arrested Mukhtiar.

48
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,375
It was bound to happen.
How long will you save him?

49
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,708
Listen to me..

50
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,916
Hello?

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He hung up!

52
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes, Mr. Dayal..
- We need to win the election at any cost.

53
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,083
How are you, Mr. Dayal?

54
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,416
I am doing great.
Tell me, how you doing?

55
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,125
I am fine.

56
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,166
You are here to meet the C.M.?

57
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:43,291
Yes, you know it has been a few days
since Anokhi Devi has gone missing.

58
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,625
All the villagers
wish to meet the C.M.

59
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,250
But he isn't at home.
- Really?

60
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,083
Sir.. call for you.

61
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,666
See you later, then.
- Okay.

62
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,541
Yes?

63
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,708
Yes, Dinanath?

64
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,125
They have arrested Mukhtiar.

65
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,750
Call Karan Singh.

66
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,000
He is acting funny.

67
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,833
I will call the commissioner.

68
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,833
Do something, please.

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,583
The S.P. is calling.

70
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,708
Who S.P.?

71
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,708
Why aren't you answering my phone?

72
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,083
And why did you arrest Mukhtiar Singh?

73
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:18,957
Him?

74
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,291
He is a criminal.

75
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,082
He murdered Anokhi Devi.

76
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,750
What nonsense!

77
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,707
Anokhi Devi is alive.

78
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:26,875
Let him go.

79
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,457
Sir, we risk our life
and arrest such criminals..

80
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,166
And you always come and let them go..

81
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,625
Because he is either your friend,
brother or nephew.. - Shut up.

82
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,666
I will suspend you right away.

83
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,333
You cannot suspend us, sir.

84
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,541
Yes, but you can surely
get us transferred.

85
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:51,833
I feel like stripping off your uniforms
and sending you home right away.

86
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:59,041
There will be a day when we
will either surrender our uniforms..

87
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:03,041
Or make sure you
are stripped of yours.

88
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,082
You let go of Mukhtiar Singh?

89
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,707
Why? Do you have a problem with that?

90
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,041
Mr. Singh, he murdered Anokhi Devi.

91
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,416
Do you have any proof?

92
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,000
Nirbhay and Nishchay arrested
him because they had proof.

93
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,083
You got them into trouble.

94
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,458
They listened to you and made a..

95
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,833
..mistake of arresting
a politician like Mukhtiar Singh.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
What were the consequences of that?

97
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,083
They were transferred to Line duty.

98
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,541
You are here every day
with someone's sob story.

99
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,541
One day you will die trying
to solve someone else's problem.

100
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,541
It's a small machine.
It will give up suddenly.

101
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:47,833
Please take care.

102
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,333
Everyone's machine
will give up one day.

103
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,625
The only difference
is when people like me die..

104
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,207
There will be millions
attending our funeral.

105
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,250
Whereas people will be paid to attend
a funeral of a corrupted cop like you.

106
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,625
Tell me what will
you take to keep mum?

107
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:08,791
I will get you a nice deal.

108
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:14,500
I will talk to Dinanath
and get you the maximum I can.

109
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,750
You can keep half of
it and I'll keep the rest.

110
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,957
Should I address you as an officer,
a broker or a pimp?

111
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,625
Being an on duty cop in uniform..

112
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,541
..you are leading an
honest man towards perfidy?

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,541
This lecture is not going
to make any difference to me.

114
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:37,707
I hold enough power
to arrest you for any crime.

115
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,082
Tell call a constable.

116
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,416
There is a room vacant
in Agra's mental asylum.

117
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,625
If you want, I shall book it for you.

118
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:51,041
Until Anokhi Devi's case is resolved..

119
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,250
Neither will I rest in peace nor will
I let the likes of you rest in peace.

120
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:06,541
My friends, a brave cop
risks his life and arrests a..

121
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,957
..criminal like Mukhtiar Singh.

122
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,041
And the S.P. lets him go scot-free.

123
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,375
If the S.P. arrests someone..

124
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,582
..at the politician behest,
the commissioner gives him a call.

125
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,458
This is our system.

126
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,666
We have gotten used to
endure torture in silence.

127
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:31,000
We all will have to raise our voices.

128
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:35,957
We will have to rekindle
the fire inside us.

129
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,750
Long live..
- Manoj Singh.

130
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,458
Long live..
- Manoj Singh.

131
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:44,457
If we have to solve
Anokhi Devi's case..

132
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,375
And if you agree..

133
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,291
Then I suggest this case
should be handed over to the C.B.I.

134
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,166
Yes! Hand it over!

135
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:57,541
Because there is no crime in
this world that cannot be exposed..

136
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,000
..if the government wishes to do so.

137
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:05,041
If the respected chief
minister can hear me..

138
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:11,082
Then I wish to tell him
that Anokhi Devi is your daughter!

139
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,916
Chief minister's daughter..

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,208
..Anokhi Devi has been
missing since the past 10 days.

141
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,125
But he is keeping mum.

142
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,625
What nonsense is this!
- Stop it!

143
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,957
I will stick to what I have said.
I shall repeat what I said.

144
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,791
C.M.'s daughter was
raped and he is keeping mum.

145
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,333
Look sir, he is saying it again.

146
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,666
Look how he is talking.
- Look how he is talking to you.

147
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,125
Sit down. Calm down, all of you.

148
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:34,082
Calm down. Please have a seat.

149
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:35,750
This is not right.

150
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:41,291
You shouldn't have linked me
with Anokhi Devi in front of everyone.

151
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:43,957
I am not linking you with anyone, sir.

152
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,041
I am just repeating what you had said.

153
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,500
Five years back when you
were the opposition leader..

154
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,250
Bhomli Devi's rape had caused
an commotion in the assembly..

155
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Do you remember what
you had told the C.M.?

156
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,250
C.M.'s daughter was
raped and he is keeping mum.

157
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,375
These were your words.

158
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,083
Every daughter in this
country is C.M.'s daughter.

159
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:12,000
And it's a shame that this case
cannot be resolved in your presence.

160
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:17,000
The public suggests this
case to be handed over to the C.B.I.

161
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:22,500
I concur that every daughter
in this country is C.M.'s daughter.

162
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,750
But I disagree that
our police is incompetent.

163
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,750
Still, if all of you want this
case to be handed over to the C.B.I...

164
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,291
Then I have no objection to it.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I will discuss this in the assembly.

166
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,458
"Truth alone prevails."
- Thank you.

167
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,958
The C.M. is scared.

168
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,291
He knows all the senior leaders
of the party are supporting us.

169
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,250
Forget it.

170
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,750
We will make Bansilal Mehra
stand as independent candidate.

171
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,290
The C.M. will lose.

172
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,000
If he loses,
he will no longer be the C.M.

173
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,500
'There is a lot of upheaval
in Rajasthan's political..

174
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,250
..scene because of Anokhi Devi.'

175
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,250
'In a cabinet meeting the C.M.
has decided that..'

176
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:06,458
'..her case should be
handed over to the C.B.I.'

177
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:11,000
C.B.I. officer Satyaprakash
Mishra will investigate this case.

178
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,291
'Today Rajasthan Royals..'

179
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,041
This is a conspiracy by the C.M.

180
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,040
He has purposely handed
this case to the C.B.I.

181
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,833
The media welcomes you, Mr. Mishra.

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Do you think you will be able
to do what the police couldn't do?

183
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,500
Will you be able to find Anokhi Devi?

184
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,500
Look, one needs the police
for such types of cases.

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,750
Sir, I've heard you
are retiring in 60 days.

186
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,583
Will you be able to
solve this case in 60 days?

187
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,333
If one is determined even 60
seconds are enough to do something.

188
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,000
But I request the media not to hype..

189
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,958
..this case and present
it as a breaking news.

190
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,333
This can ruin the case instead.

191
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,665
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

192
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,166
Sir.

193
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,750
Sir.

194
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,083
May I come in, sir?

195
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,041
Come in, S.P. Karan Singh.

196
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,833
Have a seat.
- Okay.

197
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,040
Thank you, sir.

198
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,958
I was looking at your records.

199
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,333
How did you like them, sir?

200
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,125
You are going through a bad phase.

201
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,750
Here's the file of Anokhi Devi's case.
- Keep it there.

202
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,208
Sir.

203
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,125
What kind of a woman was Anokhi Devi?

204
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,208
She was a loose woman, sir.

205
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:35,000
She was known for luring
people with her moves.

206
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,708
She was a singer and a dancer.

207
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,125
Missing person's photos get
printed in the newspaper every day.

208
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,500
No one pays attention to them.

209
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,625
But a well-known politician's
name is being linked with this case.

210
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,291
Hence this case has become so big.

211
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,125
Which politician?

212
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,583
What?

213
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,915
You must be feeling
embarrassed to tell me.

214
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,458
No.
- No, you must be.

215
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,125
Fine, I'll tell you.
Your friend Dinanath.

216
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,375
If this file wasn't
an official record..

217
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,915
..I would've torn
it apart long time ago.

218
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:10,375
This file is a character certificate
of a corrupt officer like you.

219
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,125
No, sir.

220
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,208
You think I am a fool?
- No.

221
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,250
You gave me this file to misguide me.

222
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,125
You are making an accusation on me.

223
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,125
I am not accusing you.
I am putting a charge on you.

224
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,833
Two police officers risked their
lives and caught the culprit Mukhtiar.

225
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,375
What did you do?

226
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:33,333
Without filing a F.I.R.
or a case, you let Mukhtiar go.

227
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,708
No, sir.

228
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,875
Mukhtiar is a decent man.

229
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,041
Yes, sir.

230
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,125
You too look like a decent man.

231
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,415
You may go.

232
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,083
Wait a minute. Have a seat.
- Okay. Sir.

233
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,375
Next time when I call you..
- Yes.

234
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:56,125
It will not be to seek help,
but to investigate the case.

235
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,708
You may go now.

236
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:02,708
Yes, sir.

237
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,416
May I come in, sir.

238
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,041
Come in.
- Thank you.

239
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,791
Come, Mr. Mishra.
Please have a seat.

240
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,790
You will have to handle Anokhi
Devi's matter very delicately.

241
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,000
There is too much
politics involved in it.

242
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:30,541
But I am confident that you
will solve this mystery quickly.

243
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,541
I will try, sir.

244
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:39,041
If you have decided that this
case should be solved then it will be.

245
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,833
I just want inspectors Nirbhay
and Nishchay who know this case well.

246
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:49,333
Unfortunately S.P. Karan Singh
got them transferred to Police Line.

247
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:54,415
If you can transfer S.P.
Karan Singh to Police Line..

248
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,208
And send both of them
to me then it will help.

249
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,291
You will get whatever you want.

250
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:00,583
Thank you, sir.

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,708
Sir.

252
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,125
'He placed us in Line
and now he got placed in Line.'

253
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,791
Long Live..
- Dinanath Singh!

254
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,375
Welcome, Mr. Dinanath.

255
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:53,291
You got S.P. Karan Singh transferred
in spite of knowing that he is my man?

256
00:14:55,291 --> 00:15:01,083
You know how many proofs C.B.I. officer
Mishra has against Karan Singh?

257
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,541
I'll advice you to
keep mum for a few days.

258
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,333
It will do you good.

259
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:12,541
C.M., you know I am one of
the four legs of the chair you are on.

260
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,291
And you know that a
three-legged chair is unstable.

261
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,375
There is still time for the election,
you can test my claim of you want.

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,958
Don't threaten me.

263
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,625
I respect your seniority.

264
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,583
If I am used to sitting
in C.M.'s position..

265
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,416
..then I also have experience
of sitting in the opposition.

266
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,583
Fine then,
prepare to sit in the opposition.

267
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's go.

268
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,708
Thank you, sir.

269
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,790
We are fortunate to get an opportunity
to work with you and learn.

270
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,958
You are here because
of your abilities.

271
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,165
Thanks anyway.

272
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,625
I was just reading the newspaper.

273
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,833
Who is Manoj Singh?

274
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,208
Sir, Manoj Singh knows about Anokhi
Devi's case even more than the police.

275
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,916
Sir, actually, the government
was forced to handover..

276
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,583
..this case to the C.B.I.
because of him.

277
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,958
Have you met him?

278
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,708
Yes, sir.
- Yes.

279
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,166
Are you Shamsher Singh's sons?
- Yes, sir.

280
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,790
I knew your father.
- Okay.

281
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,083
Your bravery tales
are as famous as his.

282
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,791
You two are handling
Anokhi Devi's case?

283
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,458
We are here with regards to the same.

284
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:30,041
Sir, if we get your help,
we'll find our destination.

285
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,958
I want you to listen to something.

286
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,875
Listen to this.

287
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,040
'Hello, I am Anokhi.
I think Mukhtiar will kill me.'

288
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,250
'If anything happens to me then..'

289
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,250
That's Anokhi Devi's voice.

290
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,333
'And listen..'

291
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,125
But sir..

292
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,583
I know this evidence isn't enough.

293
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,208
But..

294
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,125
You are well aware
of Mukhtiar Singh's deeds.

295
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:03,416
If you can get him arrested
then we will know the truth.

296
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,332
Sir, we arrested Mukhtiar Singh..

297
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,666
But at a politician's behest S.P.
Karan Singh let him go..

298
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,375
..without filing any report against.

299
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,375
You two will not face
any obstacles henceforth.

300
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,540
Dinanath isn't scared of the prison.

301
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,333
Humans go to prison not animals.

302
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:27,083
The day I am arrested, there will
fall short of prisons in this country.

303
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,208
I have 50 lakh supporters.

304
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,041
He will send me to prison. Scoundrel!

305
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,500
Sir, this is the number
you asked me about.

306
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,000
This is Banaram's number.

307
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,708
Okay. You may go.
- Sir.

308
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,457
Banaram? - Banaram is
Anokhi Devi's right hand, sir.

309
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,166
Find out where he is.
- Okay, sir.

310
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,625
I..
- Tell me where's the CD?!

311
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,666
Tell me!
- I don't know where the CD is..

312
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:48,582
Tell me where you have kept it!
- Sir! Sir!

313
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,708
Why are hitting me? I don't know!

314
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,958
Speak up! Speak up! You scoundrel!
- Do you see the water down below?

315
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,333
I'll get you thrown in it!
It is filled with crocodiles.

316
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,041
They'll eat you up.

317
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,583
I swear by my mother!
- Speak up!

318
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,958
I don't know where that CD is!

319
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,250
You don't know?
- I don't know where the CD is.

320
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,541
Sharma.
- Yes, sir?

321
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,625
Come here.
- I don't know. Listen to me.

322
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,625
Make him confess. Beat him up!

323
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,375
I said I don't know.

324
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,791
I am not used to killing mosquitoes.

325
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,291
I have always hunted lions.

326
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:28,375
Don't make me do it.
Tell me, where is the CD?

327
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,750
I don't know. I don't have the CD.

328
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,541
You don't know?
- I don't.

329
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,957
Then who knows?
- Anokhi Devi has it.

330
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,625
Anokhi Devi has it?
- Yes.

331
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,291
Chote.
- Yes, brother?

332
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,208
Take him to Anokhi Devi.

333
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,041
Go.

334
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,708
Take him. Be careful.
- Let's go.

335
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,166
Sir..
- Yes?

336
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,083
You need the CD?

337
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,375
Come with me.

338
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,250
Let's go.
- Let's go.

339
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,958
Stop the car.

340
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,041
Please stop, it's urgent.

341
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,458
What's urgent?
- This is.

342
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,458
Otherwise I'll have
to do it in the car.

343
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,875
You want to relief yourself?
- Yes.

344
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,041
Go and do it.

345
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:10,333
Get down.

346
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,875
Go there and do it.

347
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,375
Yes.

348
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,458
Hurry back.
- Yes.

349
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,291
Brother..

350
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,083
He ran away!

351
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,375
Banaram!
- Banaram!

352
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,332
Banaram, stop!
- Banaram, stop!

353
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,250
He ran away.

354
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,583
Brother, I think he ran away.

355
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,207
Hi.
- Hello.

356
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,958
Is this Banaram's house?
- Yes, it is.

357
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:59,083
Is he home? - No. Brother hasn't
come home since the last few days.

358
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:00,333
Is it?

359
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,208
It's nothing.
I had taken some money from him.

360
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,083
I wanted to repay him.
It's okay. I'll come some other time.

361
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,707
Listen.. please wait here.
I'll go and check inside.

362
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:12,750
Okay.

363
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,207
Brother!

364
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,166
What is it, Rano?

365
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,000
Someone outside wants
to give you money.

366
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,666
How many times have I told you!

367
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,833
If anyone comes enquiring
about me say that I'm not at home.

368
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,041
But what about the money?

369
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,457
What about the money?
Let the money go to hell.

370
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,958
You say that.
I'll leave through the backdoor.

371
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,166
Don't get into this mess.
- Listen, brother..

372
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,457
Hello.

373
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:37,541
You were running away?

374
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,083
No, sir. I was not running away.

375
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,166
What brings you here, sir?

376
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,208
I am here to take you with me.

377
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,916
You are such a senior official.

378
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,207
You could've just phoned me.
I would've come there.

379
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,250
You didn't need to come here.
- Oh really?

380
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,666
You would've come there, huh?

381
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,125
Sir.

382
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,291
Where are you hiding Anokhi?

383
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:58,958
Is she alive or did you kill her?

384
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,458
What are you saying, sir?

385
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,166
You heard what I just said.

386
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,875
Where are you hiding Anokhi?

387
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,666
I have left no stoned unturned
searching for Anokhi Devi.

388
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:13,125
I cried a river missing her.
I have lost sight. I am half blind.

389
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,375
Sir, you should find her otherwise
I'll kill myself here itself.

390
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,916
We'll decide later whether you'll
kill yourself or we'll kill you.

391
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:31,083
It was your brainchild that
made a street dancer Anokhi stand in..

392
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,791
..the power corridor.

393
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,083
She became so powerful that
it caused havoc from the capital..

394
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,333
..to Haldighati when she went missing.

395
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,000
Hence tell us the truth..

396
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:46,207
..otherwise I'll have to
spend an official bullet on you.

397
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:46,750
Sir..

398
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,666
Which one of you killed
someone last time?

399
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,166
You..
- You go ahead.

400
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,750
Here, kill him.
- Okay.

401
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,208
Kill me. Kill me, sir.
End my life.

402
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,457
If I go here,
I am asked where is Anokhi Devi.

403
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,666
If I go there,
I am asked where is Anokhi Devi.

404
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,958
My life has become miserable.

405
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,791
Anokhi Devi!
- Calm down.

406
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,125
My life has become hell.

407
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:08,875
Shut up!

408
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,541
You don't know where Anokhi Devi is?

409
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,750
I don't know, sir.

410
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,083
Then tell him whatever you know.
- Calm down.

411
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:15,416
Come on.

412
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:16,416
Come here.

413
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,207
Go, tell him.

414
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,083
Sir..

415
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,250
Anokhi Devi and..

416
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:45,666
"A knife was used somewhere."

417
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,666
"A bullet was shot somewhere."

418
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:56,332
"A group of spoilt
brats are going somewhere."

419
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,791
"A knife was used somewhere."

420
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,957
"A bullet was shot somewhere."

421
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:07,541
"A group of spoilt
brats are going somewhere."

422
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:12,166
"What do I say,
how I saved my life!"

423
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:17,750
"What do I say,
how I saved my life!"

424
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,041
"How I saved my life!"

425
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,208
"My skirt.."

426
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,291
"My skirt.."

427
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:28,666
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

428
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:33,000
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

429
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,208
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

430
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,957
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

431
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,000
"Your skirt.."

432
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,166
"Your skirt.."

433
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,333
"Your skirt.."

434
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,666
"Your skirt.."

435
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,416
"Get lost!"

436
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:16,250
"A lot of crazy lovers.."

437
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:20,375
"Have been trapped by your skirt."

438
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,125
"You made us drunk with your eyes."

439
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:29,375
"Otherwise we would've
stayed thirsty."

440
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,166
"Your skirt.."

441
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,250
"Your skirt.."

442
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,166
"Your skirt.."

443
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,291
"Your skirt.."

444
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:41,458
"Every locality,
every market, everyone is after me."

445
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:45,625
"My skirt is colorful one."

446
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,125
"The accountant and the cop,
both are contenders."

447
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:54,375
"My skirt is well decorated."

448
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:59,541
"What do I say,
how I saved my life!"

449
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,041
"What do I say,
how I saved my life!"

450
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:07,082
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

451
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:11,791
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

452
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:15,750
"Everyone seems to
be chasing your skirt."

453
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,416
"Everyone seems to
be chasing your skirt."

454
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:44,291
"We will stay close to your body."

455
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:48,291
"Make us your skirt."

456
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:53,000
"We will love you from
the bottom of our hearts."

457
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,916
"Hide us in your body."

458
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,000
"Your skirt.."

459
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,958
"Your skirt.."

460
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:03,166
"Your skirt.."

461
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:05,166
"Your skirt.."

462
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,250
"You are sloshed."

463
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,541
"Your intentions are not good."

464
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,375
"You won't get a piece of my skirt."

465
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:18,000
"Don't hover around me,
my skirt is precious."

466
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:22,125
"My skirt won't listen to you."

467
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:27,208
"What do I say,
how I saved my life!"

468
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:30,832
"What do I say,
how I saved my life!"

469
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:35,208
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

470
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:39,250
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

471
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:43,708
"Everyone seems to
be chasing your skirt."

472
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:48,166
"Everyone seems to
be chasing your skirt."

473
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,166
"Yes."

474
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,416
"Beautiful your eyes.."

475
00:26:55,583 --> 00:27:01,208
Guru.. I have a unique idea.

476
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:08,083
If Anokhi Devi joins hands with
us then her skirt will cause havoc.

477
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,541
Her skirt?
- Yes.

478
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,416
Or she?

479
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,666
You are smart.

480
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:20,291
Look, to be honest, I like her.

481
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,041
You know her, don't you?

482
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,125
You know where she stays, right?

483
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:28,833
Brother, I know in which
area and where she stays.

484
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:32,708
I know her name,
caste, creed, horoscope. Everything.

485
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,416
That's enough.
- It's dangerous. Let's not go there.

486
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:42,250
I worship art and artists.

487
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,208
Stop this nonsense.

488
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,625
"I worship art and artists."

489
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,541
There is a beacon
on top your car, right?

490
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:50,875
Yes, there is.

491
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:57,166
When the beaconed car will
go in her area it will cause a scene.

492
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,416
You will earn yourself a bad name.

493
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:00,500
Elections are just around the corner.

494
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,082
I'll cover the beacon with a cloth.

495
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,000
Who will notice it in the night?

496
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,958
Saviour of the poor, Dinanath..

497
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:10,957
To put your pants down, you are
ready to tight a cloth to the beacon.

498
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,333
Get this straight.

499
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:17,332
A naked man and a covered
beacon are never respected.

500
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,833
Don't get into this mess.

501
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,375
Anokhi Devi is a deep dark well.

502
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,582
I wish to fall in this well.

503
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:26,166
You can survive a fall
from the top of a mountain..

504
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,166
But you won't be able
to survive the trap of a skirt.

505
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,666
After the election..

506
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,541
Why after the election?

507
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:41,000
I need it during the election.

508
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,750
Fine. Tomorrow.

509
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,166
Hello.
- Hello, sir.

510
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:46,791
Banaram.

511
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:47,500
Welcome, Banaram.

512
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:48,416
Thank you, sir.

513
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,041
Come here.

514
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:50,625
Okay..

515
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,291
Sit up here.
- Sit over here.

516
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:53,166
No, I'm fine, sir.

517
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,583
Not there, sit over here.

518
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:55,707
Over here.

519
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,500
Thank you, sir.

520
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:01,166
So you are Anokhi Devi's bodyguard.

521
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:02,500
Sir.

522
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:05,416
You have found a gem.

523
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:11,291
Why don't you give it to me?
I'll make your life a luxurious one.

524
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,083
Hey..

525
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,208
Why is he laughing?

526
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:16,750
It's a habit.

527
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:22,457
Even at a funeral,
his crying would sound like laughter.

528
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,666
Thank you, sir.

529
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,666
He watched the show yesterday.

530
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:28,500
Do you know who he is?

531
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:30,583
Yes, we met at the show yesterday.

532
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,750
When someone like Mr. Dinanath,
a party leader..

533
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:35,291
Yes.

534
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,333
Is so affected by Anokhi Devi's art..

535
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,375
..I wonder what must
be the state of young men.

536
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,291
Sir, every day a young man
faints and goes to the hospital.

537
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,291
Because of madam.

538
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,957
He is right. You will die.

539
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,125
Who wishes to live?

540
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Everyone has to die one day.

541
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,957
Why don't I have
some fun before I die?

542
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:56,708
Sir..

543
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:57,916
Get Anokhi Devi.

544
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,125
Sorry!

545
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,750
Will she come here?
- She will.

546
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,000
Soon she will be an M.L.A.
then a minister.. - Sir..

547
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,125
And you will be her secretary.

548
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:08,416
She is a wild horse.
No one can control her.

549
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:11,166
I too have had rich diet.

550
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:12,916
I am strong all over.

551
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,957
Thank you, sir.
May I leave?

552
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:17,291
Secretary?
- Yes, sir?

553
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,500
Give him a box of sweets.

554
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:20,625
Small one or a big one?

555
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,541
A small one for now.

556
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,083
Then?

557
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,207
Then..
- A big one later.

558
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:30,333
And after that..
something bigger. - Yes.

559
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,125
He likes Anokhi Devi.
- Yes.

560
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:34,458
Got him.

561
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:36,500
Why are you talking nonsense?

562
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:37,332
I won't meet him.

563
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:41,458
Your moves have made Mr.
Dinanath go crazy.

564
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,583
You have made a fused bulb light up.

565
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,250
A politician has
become a fan of yours.

566
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:51,208
Listen..

567
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:56,833
If you want to enter politics
then this is the first step.

568
00:30:57,416 --> 00:31:01,832
After taking the first
step you can soar higher..

569
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:07,875
From up there,
the world will look small to you.

570
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,375
You will get a big car, the crowd..

571
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,957
Well-known people will look up to you.

572
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:19,457
Even the best ones
will bow down to you.

573
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:20,041
Yes.

574
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:21,291
What do you say?

575
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,875
Hello.
- Hello.

576
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,125
Welcome, Mr. Sharma. How are you?

577
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:29,041
You met her?

578
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,250
I seek your blessings, madam.
- What are you doing?

579
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:33,375
It's nothing.
This is what happens in politics.

580
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,791
Someone or the other is touching
someone's feet for some reason.

581
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,125
He too has gotten into a habit.

582
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,125
It's worse, it flows in his veins now.

583
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:44,041
When he goes home,
he also touches his wife's feet.

584
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,166
Am I right, Mr. Sharma?
- Come on!

585
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,583
What brings you here?

586
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,916
Sir has sent a new car for her.

587
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:53,332
And asked me to make sure
she goes there in this car.

588
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:54,916
What.. what!

589
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:57,625
Here, talk to him.

590
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,291
Go ahead, talk to him.

591
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,208
Hello, sir.
- Hi.

592
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:09,875
This car, these gifts..
I usually don't accept gifts.

593
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:14,041
This is just the beginning, madam.

594
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,458
I.. I cannot accept it.

595
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:19,250
Please consider me
as your well-wisher.

596
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:22,208
Come here, we'll talk. Okay?

597
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,833
Just sit in the car and come here.

598
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:33,833
I was relaxing in a vest and you
have made me dress up and sit here.

599
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:35,791
Half an hour as passed.
When will she come?

600
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,707
Saviour of the poor, Dinanath..

601
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,750
Hello.
- Welcome.

602
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:44,791
Come here.

603
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,666
Mr. Dinanath.
- Hi.

604
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:48,375
Hello.
- Hi.

605
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:49,541
Welcome.

606
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:52,332
How are you?
- Fine.

607
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,458
Would you like some refreshments?

608
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:55,666
No, thank you.

609
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,958
You have met her?

610
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,332
Yes, you were at the show.

611
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,333
It's very..
- Yes.

612
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,208
I cannot express it.
It was an amazing show.

613
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,166
It had gathered a lot of crowd.

614
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:14,707
We put posters, shout slogans
but yet cannot gather such a crowd.

615
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:19,083
And what a crowd.
Everyone was getting restless.

616
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,457
Some of them fainted.

617
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,958
If someone like you is in
the Legislative Assembly, I say..

618
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:31,082
..then not even a single
M.L.A will be absent.

619
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:34,041
Even if it's raining
heavily or he has fallen ill.

620
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,791
They will attend the
Legislative Assembly session.

621
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,875
Hello, Mr. Dinanath.
- Hello, Mr. Gupta.

622
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I was discussing
something very important.

623
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,458
But it's okay.
We'll discuss it later.

624
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:44,000
Come, have a seat.
- Thank you.

625
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,583
How are you?
- I am fine.

626
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,208
Do you know who she is?

627
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,207
You are a famous dancer.

628
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:54,375
Not a dancer, an artist.

629
00:33:54,833 --> 00:34:01,208
Even a religious man like
Mr. Gupta knows who you are.

630
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,250
He too has heard about you.

631
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,333
What brings you here, Mr. Gupta?

632
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:09,875
There is a school in Biravar,
I want you to inaugurate it.

633
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,166
That's all.

634
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:14,375
With these hands?

635
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,791
Forget about it. Look over there.

636
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,583
God has created him
with a lot of affection.

637
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:23,458
He must have spent
a week to create her.

638
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,833
And he created me in half
an hour and threw me here.

639
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:27,958
Look at my nose.

640
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:29,375
He changed it.

641
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:31,583
Make her do it.

642
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,916
But Mr. Dinanath..

643
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,666
You won't even have to gather a crowd.

644
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:38,416
Just announce that Anokhi
Devi is inaugurating a school.

645
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:41,375
Mother, children,
grandparents, everyone will be there.

646
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,000
Such a big job.. I can't.

647
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,333
This isn't a big job.

648
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,083
It's not at all big.

649
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:50,458
You just have to go, cut the
ribbon and take the envelope of money.

650
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:51,041
That's all.

651
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,458
Banaram, make the arrangements.
- Okay, Mr. Dinanath.

652
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,041
Okay then, I'll make a move.

653
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:55,458
Okay.

654
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:56,166
Bye.

655
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:58,791
You make an arrangement
for the envelope.

656
00:34:58,916 --> 00:34:59,666
Okay.

657
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:04,250
One, two, three, four..
- Long live Mr. Dinanath!

658
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:08,541
One, two, three, four..
- Long live Mr. Dinanath!

659
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,833
One, two, three, four..
- Long live Mr. Dinanath!

660
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:17,208
One, two, three, four..
- Long live Mr. Dinanath!

661
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:23,166
Hello. - Hi.

662
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:27,208
I seek affection for the young
ones and blessings from the elders.

663
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,500
Anokhi Devi seeks your blessings.

664
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:33,916
She is seeking your blessings,
you act like her brother, right?

665
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,500
Listen.. listen to her.

666
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:38,125
Ladies and gentlemen..

667
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:40,041
Ask the tears..

668
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,083
Ask the tears..

669
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,166
To stop flowing.

670
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,250
Ask the lips..

671
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,291
To stop staying mum.

672
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:52,125
Rekindle the fire within you..

673
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,500
Rekindle the fire within you..

674
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:58,750
Let that fire burn brighter!

675
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,958
Long live..
- Anokhi Devi!

676
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,875
Long live..
- Anokhi Devi!

677
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,708
Your future is in danger.

678
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,375
They are all shouting slogans for her.

679
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,291
That's good, isn't it?

680
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:13,875
The more renowned she
gets the more I will grow.

681
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,500
Ladies and gentlemen..

682
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,875
Mr. Dinanath made me
inaugurate a school today.

683
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:21,916
I thank him for that.

684
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,166
He is a well-known politician.

685
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,708
He could've inaugurated
the school himself.

686
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But I don't know why he has given
an ordinary artist such an honour.

687
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:32,541
Great.

688
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,541
I welcome Mr. Dinanath
from the bottom of my heart.

689
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:38,250
Long live..
- Mr. Dinanath!

690
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:40,791
Long live..
- Mr. Dinanath!

691
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,375
I seek your blessings, sir.
- No, give me a hug.

692
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,583
Like this.

693
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,791
Friends, all of you know
that Anokhi Devi rules your hearts.

694
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:03,416
But now she has decided
to join politics.

695
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:06,583
And she will bring glory to our party.

696
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:09,750
I thank her from
the bottom of my heart.

697
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,041
Long live..
- Anokhi Devi!

698
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,541
Love live..
- Mr. Dinanath!

699
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,041
A unique union of art and politics.

700
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:18,416
Wonderful.

701
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,125
Did you notice something?

702
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,250
The crowd went crazy.

703
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,125
I thought Dinanath might get scared
of the praises you got and will say..

704
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:33,375
"Madam, it's not right
for you to enter politics."

705
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,083
Speak of the devil
and the devil appears.

706
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,458
Hello, sir. Welcome.
- Hi.

707
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,166
Wonderful.

708
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:49,291
Anokhi, today, your speech reminded
me of Ms. Indira and Mr. Atal.

709
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:56,583
They used to say
ladies and gentlemen..

710
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,750
And the crowd would keep quiet.

711
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:04,041
People used to pay
attention to what they said.

712
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:08,166
Your speech today..

713
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,791
I am pleased.

714
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,208
Hats off to you, Anokhi Devi.

715
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:18,583
He is on the track.

716
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:21,208
You are a miracle.

717
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:35,208
I want you to leave this rented
apartment and shift into a bungalow.

718
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:36,875
I will make the arrangements.

719
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:41,791
I want to make you the
most powerful women in the world.

720
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,833
I'll make you an M.L.A.

721
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,958
I'll make you a minister.

722
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:48,166
I will get you a car
with a beacon on the top.

723
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:52,125
There will be armed
bodyguards surrounding you.

724
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:56,541
When you'll proceed towards
your residence from your office..

725
00:38:56,875 --> 00:39:02,250
There will a police vehicles
before and behind your car.

726
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,208
And the whole city will standstill
till you don't enter your house.

727
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:08,708
There will be a traffic jam.

728
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,416
Nobody moves..

729
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,125
You are sure that I'll
be successful in politics?

730
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:19,541
You have Dinanath backing you.

731
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,250
Not that Dinanath (God),
this Dinanath.

732
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,791
Long live..
- Anokhi Devi!

733
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,708
Long live..
- Anokhi Devi!

734
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:43,666
Long live..
- Anokhi Devi!

735
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,666
Okay..

736
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,041
So..?

737
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,625
How did you like the bungalow?

738
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,291
How is it?

739
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
You didn't like it?

740
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,500
Okay, I'll get another one for you.

741
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:26,333
Yes?

742
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:28,833
What?

743
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:31,625
Why are you staring at me?

744
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,125
It's such a big house.

745
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:39,083
Big people like big stuff.

746
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:42,000
I want you to live like a queen.

747
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:46,041
The happier you are the
happier you will make me.

748
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:46,500
Right?

749
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,958
Right, Banaram?
- Thank you, sir.

750
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:50,041
Yes.

751
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,000
You should throw away your
old shoes when you get new ones.

752
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:57,375
Got it?

753
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,875
No matter how expensive it is.

754
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:07,625
I want to transfer all
the power Dayal has to you.

755
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:11,833
I see all the traits
of a good leader in you.

756
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:15,791
I will make you stand
for M.L.A's seat from Mertha.

757
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,000
It's your home ground.

758
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,416
Right?

759
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,166
Come on, let's get started.

760
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,083
Very good.

761
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:24,583
Yes.

762
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:29,333
Okay.

763
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,250
Keep your leg here.

764
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,375
What are you doing, sir?

765
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,708
What if anyone sees you
applying nail polish on my toes?

766
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:57,708
Okay, so now you have started
getting informal with me?

767
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:01,250
This is what happens in love.

768
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:05,250
Don't answer it.

769
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:07,500
What happened?

770
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,666
It must be one of my men.

771
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:12,000
Hello?

772
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:13,500
Where are you?

773
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:16,833
I am busy with some family matters.

774
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:18,541
I know your family matters very well.

775
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,250
You can do family planning later.

776
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:20,833
Come here right away.

777
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:23,541
We need to plan for the state,
the C.M. is waiting.

778
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,958
We need to decide on the tickets.

779
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:28,166
That decision was taken long back.

780
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,458
The C.M. has a habit
to keep calling meetings.

781
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,583
Tell him that I am not feeling well.

782
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:36,333
I will send a medical certificate.

783
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:39,875
If it is valid in a
court then why not there.

784
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:43,833
Stop troubling me.

785
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:45,250
What...!

786
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:46,291
Bloody skirt chaser!

787
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,625
You know how a tiger attacks?

788
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,625
Sir..

789
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:58,791
Sir..! Yes, sir.

790
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,458
You have to make an image.
Cover you head.

791
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:09,916
All ladies will get influenced.

792
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,458
My queen is getting famous.

793
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,541
'He misses no opportunity.'

794
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:17,250
That's it.

795
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,500
Higher. Higher. Higher.

796
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:21,416
Set the position.

797
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:23,416
Higher. Click it.

798
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:27,166
That's enough. You are done.

799
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:28,708
Nice. Well done.

800
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,083
Listen, Mr. Sharma..
- Yes, sir?

801
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,791
These hoarding should be places all
over the city within a week's time.

802
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:36,875
Huge ones.
- It will be done.

803
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,750
So big that it should put
Madras and Lucknow to shame.

804
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:41,541
Okay, sir.

805
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:42,791
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

806
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,250
Click a private one.

807
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:49,500
Mr. Dayal..

808
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:50,750
Hello.
- Hi.

809
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:51,458
Hello.

810
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,375
Welcome, sir.

811
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,000
Hi.

812
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:57,500
How are you?

813
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:58,833
Great.

814
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,125
I can see that.

815
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,375
I want you to do something.

816
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:08,125
I want Degana's M.L.A.
seat confirmed for Chaudhary Ramniwas.

817
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,416
You can take 5 crores.

818
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:12,750
Why are you joking with me?

819
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:15,208
Mr. Dinanath is like a brother to you.

820
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:16,958
Yes.

821
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:26,083
But nowadays you are
more important to him than me.

822
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:27,750
I cannot do it.

823
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,541
Yes, sir. It will be done.
- Shut up.

824
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,375
I am not saying anything.
I will stay quiet.

825
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,625
Anokhi, politics is a sea of pearls.

826
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:39,916
Whenever you dive in, you will
surface with a hand full of pearls.

827
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:45,250
Look, politics is a
place where you mint money.

828
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:58,875
Hello, sir.

829
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,500
Hi.

830
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,958
Where have you been, my queen?

831
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm always at your feet.

832
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,416
I'm the one who is at your feet.

833
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:09,541
You shouldn't leave, I feel sad.

834
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:10,791
It's the same for me.

835
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:15,250
Hey, you will kill me.

836
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,375
I will eat you up.

837
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:17,791
Hey..

838
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,416
Come on..

839
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,083
Hey..

840
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:30,666
Will you do me a favour?

841
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,875
Ask away, your highness.

842
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,666
I'll lay flat on the floor for you.

843
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:39,625
Give me Degana's seat's
ticket for Ramniwas Chaudhary.

844
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:42,916
Ramniwas Chaudhary! That scoundrel?

845
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,500
I don't like him.

846
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,708
He used to be very close to you.
What happened?

847
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:49,333
No one is ever very close in politics.

848
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,541
How did you get into that mess?

849
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,583
Sweetheart..

850
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,916
Stop being angry and give
me the ticket for Ramniwas.

851
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,791
I know his wife.

852
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:01,125
Really?

853
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,125
Is she as beautiful as you are?

854
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:07,000
Hey, come on. How can anyone
be beautiful compared to you?

855
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,041
Give me your hand.

856
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:10,583
A pen?

857
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,125
Ramniwas..

858
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:20,000
Ramniwas.. Degana

859
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:21,958
Go and show it to him.

860
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:23,291
He got the ticket.

861
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,125
Mr. Ramniwas.

862
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:37,125
He has brought 5 crores.

863
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:39,625
Hello.

864
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:43,708
Hi, headman. How are you?

865
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:45,833
I am pleased to see you progress.

866
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:47,291
It's all thanks to you.

867
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:50,250
No, Anokhi.
I am ashamed of what I did.

868
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:51,708
Please forgive me.

869
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:52,833
Anokhi, please forgive me.

870
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:56,333
What will people say when
they'll see me sit with a destitute?

871
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:59,250
If you want to talk
to me then go and sit there.

872
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:00,583
Get up. Go and sit over there.

873
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,375
I am a Nobody.

874
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:06,333
If anyone sees you touch
my feet then you'll be defamed.

875
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,291
Mangala's wife is giving
5 lakhs for the ticket.

876
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:11,666
What do you have to give me?

877
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,208
I will give you whatever I have.

878
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,333
That's not enough.

879
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:20,083
This is business.

880
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,541
It's time to make money.

881
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:23,375
I will give the ticket
to Mangala's wife.

882
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,791
It's time to make money.

883
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,583
You should start making
preparations for the election.

884
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:32,541
I will myself ask
people to vote for you.

885
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,833
Thank you very much.

886
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:40,041
You are worthless.
Get out of here!

887
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:43,250
She wants a ticket!

888
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,166
Aunt!

889
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,291
Mangala's men have
put a lock on your house.

890
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:14,666
What's happening?

891
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,541
Why did your men lock my house?

892
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:19,791
I have the key with me.

893
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:20,666
Do you want it?

894
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,416
Your stubbornness will kill you.

895
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:26,708
You can become rich whenever you want.

896
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:29,875
You possess such a big treasure.

897
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:33,166
You will ever get
what you are thinking.

898
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:34,041
Fine.

899
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:37,500
Give me fifty thousand
and take the key.

900
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:39,875
I will repay in instalments.

901
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,458
You still haven't given me a penny.

902
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:45,083
What will you do with the
honour you are trying to save..

903
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:49,666
..when the villagers learn
that your mother has lost her house?

904
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:05,541
You are great, Mahatma Gandhi.

905
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:10,583
You can make anyone rich or poor.

906
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,208
I used to yearn for hundred rupees.

907
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,458
Now I have millions in front of me.

908
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:19,875
Papa!

909
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,791
I had gone to Anokhi's house.

910
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,791
You know she has become
very rich overnight.

911
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:31,833
She owns a big house,
a big car, has servants.

912
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:34,250
She has completely changed.

913
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:35,791
What's in this bag?

914
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:37,833
Rs. 5 crores.

915
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:39,666
Anokhi has given them.

916
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:41,625
She trusts us.

917
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:44,333
You know she is contesting
in the elections.

918
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,833
Give it back.

919
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:48,375
But why?

920
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:50,333
Call her and ask her to take it back.

921
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,833
I didn't steal this money.

922
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:56,666
You are from a rich family.

923
00:49:57,666 --> 00:49:59,583
You don't know the value of money.

924
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,666
I know what poverty is.

925
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:07,625
I have seen my mother
struggle for every penny.

926
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:11,291
My father passed
away when I was a child.

927
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:14,250
I didn't have money to
treat my mother's illness.

928
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:16,625
I have seen her die a painful death.

929
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,208
For you this is just paper.

930
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,750
But for me, this is God.

931
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,958
After a lot of struggle this
Anokhi has become Anokhi Devi.

932
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:32,875
I asked Dinanath to give someone
a ticket for a M.L.A.'s seat.

933
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,250
I got 5 crores for that.

934
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,291
So what's wrong in that?

935
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:40,125
It's a pity..

936
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,875
..political positions are..

937
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:45,291
..being disturbed for money
and not on the bases of competence.

938
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,333
When these people will win and rule..

939
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:52,125
What kind of a reign it will
be and what will be the policy?

940
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:56,458
Anokhi, don't get into this mess.

941
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:59,583
When they didn't spare this
country how will stay spare you?

942
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:01,250
Give this money back.

943
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,458
What about my ticket, sir?
- Keep quiet.

944
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:05,916
"What about my ticket?"

945
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,583
This is not sweets that
I will keep distributing.

946
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:13,166
The headman wants to become an M.L.A.

947
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:14,541
The M.L.A. wants to become a minister.

948
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,083
And the minister wants
to become a the chief minister.

949
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,875
The chief minister wants
to become the prime minister.

950
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,791
Everyone has an inch to scratch.

951
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:24,041
Everyone is talking
about Anokhi Devi's ticket.

952
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:26,541
I have been opposing
this from the very beginning.

953
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,750
I have tried reasoning
it with Dinanath.

954
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,416
He shouldn't get involved with Anokhi.

955
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,708
But he doesn't listen.
He is stubborn.

956
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,250
He doesn't listen to me.

957
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,750
He does what he feels like.

958
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:40,250
Last night I told him when..

959
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:43,291
..the opposition has given
the ticket to Lakhan Chaudhary..

960
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:45,458
..then we should give the
ticket to Mukhtiar Pehalwan.

961
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:46,000
That's it.

962
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:47,333
But he doesn't listen.

963
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:50,333
People think from up here
and he thinks from down there.

964
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,666
Reason it with him or he
will be shot from down below.

965
00:51:55,041 --> 00:52:00,958
He will be framed for
crimes committed by all of us.

966
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:04,375
First let the opposition
party decide on their candidate.

967
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:07,791
Then we will announce
the name of our candidate.

968
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:12,750
If they give the ticket to a nice
man then we too shall do the same.

969
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:17,083
If they place a criminal
then we too shall do the same.

970
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:19,625
We party has a lot of criminals.

971
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:22,541
For Mertha they have announced
Lakhan Chaudhary's name.

972
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,583
We too should place
a leader with muscle power.

973
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:31,625
And I think Mukhtiar is
the perfect candidate for it.

974
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:36,416
Anokhi Devi will contest from Mertha.

975
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,625
She has my blessings.

976
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:41,291
Anokhi Devi won't suffice.

977
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,458
Lakhan Chaudhary is
a very strong candidate.

978
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:46,625
You should get Mukhtiar.

979
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:50,041
Do you think Anokhi
Devi is a weak candidate?

980
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:52,750
She gathers a crowd wherever she goes.

981
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,458
And our party is in the limelight.

982
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:57,875
Even if we make a donkey contest,
he will win.

983
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,333
Mukhtiar has made up his
mind to contest in the elections.

984
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,750
If you don't give him
a ticket the opposition will.

985
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:08,791
He has muscle power. A lot of it.

986
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:10,416
Think over it.

987
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:13,708
As far as Anokhi Devi is concerned..

988
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:15,666
..we will make her contest
from someplace else.

989
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:19,541
We need to think of her
otherwise she will destroy me.

990
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:20,083
Look at this!

991
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,875
One, two, three, four..
fifty and not five.

992
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,625
I will have your posters
placed everywhere.

993
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:29,791
Anokhi Devi will be seen
in every lane and juncture.

994
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:34,291
People will lift their head
and look at your poster and faint.

995
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:36,333
Let me know if there's
anything missing.

996
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:38,041
You have Banaram with you.
- This is what is missing.

997
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,083
Hello.
- This is missing.

998
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,500
Make her wear it.
Place it on her if you want to.

999
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:43,666
He's Mukhtiar.

1000
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,791
A well-known goon of our area.

1001
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:49,041
No one can win the election
in Mertha without his support.

1002
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:52,291
I am here to tell you that
I am contesting from Mertha.

1003
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:54,541
Dinanath will decide that.

1004
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:56,416
Dinanath cannot make that decision.

1005
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:57,875
I am the one making the decision.

1006
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,250
Reason it with her.

1007
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,541
You are threatening
me in my own house?

1008
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:04,125
You are very arrogant
about your power, aren't you?

1009
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:05,458
Do one thing..
- Anokhi..

1010
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:08,291
Let us both contest
as independent candidates.

1011
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,083
Let's see who the public votes for.

1012
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:12,708
Your pistol or my moves..

1013
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:13,666
Calm down, Anokhi.

1014
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:14,916
Why should I calm down?

1015
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,791
He is threatening me in my own house?

1016
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:22,916
Tell Dinanath that your madam has
decided not to contest from Mertha.

1017
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:24,000
Okay.

1018
00:54:24,125 --> 00:54:25,083
Let's go.
- Bye.

1019
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,166
Okay.

1020
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,583
What did he say?
- Sir..

1021
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:30,250
What does he think of himself?

1022
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,541
Let me tell you something, Anokhi.

1023
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,416
Let's not get into this mess.

1024
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,666
Mukhtiar knows a lot
of Dinanath's secrets.

1025
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:42,916
He cannot go against
Mukhtiar even if he wants to.

1026
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:44,666
I am not a novice either.

1027
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:47,458
I have given up everything,
I won't keep quiet.

1028
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:49,500
Be brave.

1029
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,333
I'll handle everyone.

1030
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:09,041
"Come closer."

1031
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:10,500
"Come close to me."

1032
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:13,166
"I am getting restless."

1033
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,833
"My heart is beating faster too."

1034
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:18,583
"I can feel the heat."

1035
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:31,541
"Come on, place a bet on love."

1036
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:39,125
"Come on, place a bet on love."

1037
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,791
"We both are here."

1038
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:45,125
"Our hearts are beyond logic."

1039
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:50,416
"There is no patience left."

1040
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:57,791
"Come on, place a bet on love."

1041
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:05,875
"Come on, place a bet on love."

1042
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:11,708
"My breath is erratic.
My heart yearns."

1043
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:17,708
"Come on, quench my thirst."

1044
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:22,458
"Oh yeah!"

1045
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:32,083
"Come into my arms."

1046
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,166
"Hold me."

1047
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:35,791
"Take whatever you want."

1048
00:56:35,916 --> 00:56:40,208
"Enjoy the warmth of my embrace."

1049
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:43,625
"Not being restricted by any ties.."

1050
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:46,500
"Let me love you the most.."

1051
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:51,125
"And take everything
that you possess."

1052
00:56:57,375 --> 00:57:04,500
"Come on, place a bet on love."

1053
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:12,500
"Come on, place a bet on love."

1054
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:21,333
"Come on, place a bet on love."

1055
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:29,291
Why is this trouble here?

1056
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:30,458
Hello.

1057
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:35,541
Welcome.
Welcome, my lion. My brave lion.

1058
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:37,458
My advisor!

1059
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,375
I was just thinking about meeting you.

1060
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,708
To tell me not to
contest in the elections?

1061
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,208
What are you saying?

1062
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:43,666
Have a seat.

1063
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:51,750
The opposition is petrified from
the time you have decided to contest.

1064
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,375
But I have a suggestion to make.

1065
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:57,375
You should contest from
Ajmer instead of Mertha.

1066
00:57:57,791 --> 00:58:00,500
There are more Muslims in Ajmer.

1067
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:03,708
It seems difficult
contesting from Mertha.

1068
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:09,291
You think it is difficult for
me to win and your girl, the dancer..

1069
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:10,625
It's easier for her to win?

1070
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:15,000
Look, you can sit
on her lap if you want.

1071
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,458
She can only get
you love and not votes.

1072
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:20,750
I have decided that
I will contest from Mertha.

1073
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:21,583
And that's final.

1074
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:24,500
Where are you going?
Why are you getting angry?

1075
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:27,166
Get some tea, please.

1076
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:29,291
We will do as you say.

1077
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:31,791
You can contest from
wherever you want.

1078
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:33,750
What are you saying, Mukhtiar?

1079
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:36,833
Where are you, Banaram?
- With the hoarding maker.

1080
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:38,541
You always disappear in the morning.

1081
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:40,291
Don't you have to deposit
money in the bank?

1082
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:40,958
I am here to do some work.

1083
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:44,500
'Mukhtiar Khan's name has
been announced from Mertha.'

1084
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:48,625
'From Degana, Ramniwas Chaudhary
will be Janseva Party's contestant.

1085
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:53,250
'Other contestants name
will be announced soon.'

1086
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:54,958
Sir, Anokhi Devi's call.

1087
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:58,541
Anokhi Devi!
Tell her I am not at home.

1088
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,791
He has left his phone at home.

1089
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:11,791
Look, your madam is here.

1090
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:13,250
My?

1091
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:15,333
Yours or mine,
it doesn't make a different.

1092
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,833
Calm her down. Hurry up.

1093
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:20,916
Yes, Mr. Gupta?

1094
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:23,250
What is this game that
you are playing with me?

1095
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:24,458
Let's go inside and talk.

1096
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:26,166
We will talk here.

1097
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,166
We cannot discuss
this out in the open.

1098
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,625
Come on, let's go inside.

1099
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:33,500
Think about what I said,
Mr. Gupta.

1100
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:36,083
This will benefit both of us.

1101
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,125
I will think over it.
- Yes.

1102
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,041
No, take your time.

1103
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,125
Calm down.
I will find a solution, I promise.

1104
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,291
You promise?

1105
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,791
You guys never keep your promises.

1106
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,041
Will you call him here
or should I go outside?

1107
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,583
I think she is angry.

1108
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:57,416
Why are you getting angry, madam?

1109
00:59:57,916 --> 01:00:01,333
There isn't just one seat,
there are 200 of them in the state.

1110
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:03,833
If not Mertha we will make
you contest from somewhere else.

1111
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:06,375
If needed I'll let go of my position,
and you can take it.

1112
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:07,333
I'll back out.

1113
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,083
Stop your drama.

1114
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:12,750
If I know how to strip,
I also know how to expose others.

1115
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:14,208
Hey! Stop it!

1116
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:16,166
I had told you not
to play this game.

1117
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,083
Don't chase the skirt..

1118
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,541
I have the price for it.

1119
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,750
I have given her a lot.
Wealth, money, car..

1120
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:27,291
I picked her up from the
ground and made her a queen.

1121
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,541
I have made her rich.

1122
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,083
If you need more you
can take another 20-50 lakhs.

1123
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:32,916
I am very generous.

1124
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:35,500
Don't try to lure me with money.

1125
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,958
I can get many fools like
you if I move my skirt a little.

1126
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,541
Mind your language!

1127
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:44,000
You are a fool.
You gave me the key to your fate.

1128
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:46,791
Get out of here. Get out!
- What are you doing? - Let go!

1129
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:48,041
Hey, old man!
- What are you doing!

1130
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:49,000
Have you seen your face in the mirror?

1131
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,625
Forget a human,
not even a dog will go close to you.

1132
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:53,833
Get lost! Just hear him talk!
- Banaram, get her out of here!

1133
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:54,666
Let go of me!

1134
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:57,125
You got what you wanted and
I got what I wanted. - Scoundrel.

1135
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,041
Get lost!
- You will be damned!

1136
01:00:58,166 --> 01:01:00,750
When she had come she used to say,
"I make a mean mutton curry."

1137
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,750
"I'll make it for you."

1138
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,875
Calm down.
- She will cook mutton for me!

1139
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,416
A thankless wretch!

1140
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:09,833
Calm down.
- Let go of me.

1141
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,083
Do you want to get us killed?

1142
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:12,583
Why are you getting angry with me?

1143
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:13,500
All this is happening because of you.

1144
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:14,000
What did I do?

1145
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:15,416
You were the one who praised Dinanath.

1146
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:16,416
You were the one who introduced us.

1147
01:01:16,541 --> 01:01:18,666
He is this, he is that.
He is like this. He is like that.

1148
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:19,583
Have fun now.

1149
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:22,166
Whatever I did was for your own good.
- "For me!"

1150
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:23,333
You should go and question Mr. Dayal.

1151
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:24,666
You will become an M.L.A.

1152
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:25,833
You will get a beaconed car.

1153
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:26,958
You will become a chief minister.

1154
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:27,791
Didn't you say such things?

1155
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,625
Mr. Dayal had promised me.

1156
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:31,500
You should talk to him.

1157
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,541
He is the one who showed us
this dream. - Mr. Dayal, yeah right!

1158
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:36,833
There he is! Why have you
gotten me into this mess, sir?

1159
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,791
You have a right to be angry, Anokhi.

1160
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:40,708
Get this straight.

1161
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:44,541
If someone cheats or deceives me..

1162
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:46,791
And if I don't get Mertha's seat..

1163
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,541
Then I'll do something
which you cannot even dream him!

1164
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:51,916
Why are you getting angry with me?

1165
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,333
I just told Dinanath that
what he did with you was not right.

1166
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,916
Let me show you what all he did to me!

1167
01:01:58,041 --> 01:01:59,416
The whole drama!

1168
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,416
Come on, have a seat.

1169
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:26,375
This is just a trailer.

1170
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,791
The film isn't over yet.

1171
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:28,041
The film isn't over yet.

1172
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:40,916
Yes? What happened?

1173
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,291
What else could've happened?

1174
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:46,708
She has made a CD
of you using her mobile.

1175
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:51,416
I just saw all your
deeds and poses on bed.

1176
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:53,958
That CD will ruin your reputation.

1177
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,541
Your political career will be over.

1178
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:56,916
The entire state will
be disgusted with you.

1179
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,375
You will be criticized
by every household.

1180
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,125
Forget the daytime, you wouldn't be
able to face anyone at night either.

1181
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:05,416
And the party you have
served all these years..

1182
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:07,875
The same party will throw you out.

1183
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:12,791
Yes?

1184
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:14,791
Did the old man understand?

1185
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,458
Reason it with him or I will ruin him.

1186
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:21,375
He is feeling embarrassed.
Here, talk to him.

1187
01:03:21,791 --> 01:03:24,208
I made a very big mistake, madam.

1188
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:32,083
Now, should I come to you to apologize
or will you come to me to forgive me?

1189
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,000
Hello?

1190
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:37,875
She disconnected the call.

1191
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:40,666
Thank God it's just the
phone which has been disconnected.

1192
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:42,666
Will you just stop your nonsense?

1193
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:49,125
Anokhi Devi, please accept
well-wishes from Premprakash Gupta.

1194
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,458
Why are you embarrassing me,
Mr. Gupta.

1195
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:53,375
You are elder to me.

1196
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,125
Please accept my well-wishes.

1197
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:58,208
You are incomparable.
There is no one like you.

1198
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:00,291
People of Biravar have
still not forgotten you.

1199
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:03,583
How are you, Mr. Dinanath?

1200
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:07,416
What is she doing over here?

1201
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:08,791
Banaram!

1202
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:13,791
Anokhi went to the C.M.
or did the C.M. call her?

1203
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:15,166
I'll give you an advice.

1204
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,541
Touch her feet and
apologize in a closed room.

1205
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:24,041
Stop your nonsense.
You think I'll apologize to her?

1206
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:27,416
I won't apologize to
her even if I am dying.

1207
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,958
I will die but I won't apologize.

1208
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,541
It's Dinanath.
- Talk to him. Don't be scared.

1209
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:41,125
Hello?
- Did you go to meet the C.M.?

1210
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:42,958
Yes, I did.
- Why?

1211
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:46,000
I had work.
I didn't go there to have tea.

1212
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:50,458
Look Anokhi,
the path you have chosen is not right.

1213
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,833
You will regret it.

1214
01:04:52,416 --> 01:04:53,291
You are threatening me?

1215
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,333
I am not threatening you.
I am trying to reason with you.

1216
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,166
What is wrong with you?

1217
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:01,625
Don't take a wrong step
getting influenced by others.

1218
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:02,750
Got it?

1219
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:05,291
Come on now,
stop being angry and come here.

1220
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
He is getting restless.

1221
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:09,041
Hello?

1222
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:13,500
I slept with her
and I invited trouble.

1223
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:22,500
Talk about Anokhi Devi and
thousands of crowd will gather.

1224
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,250
Hence I've decided that
not Dinanath but Dindayal..

1225
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:27,416
..will be the next chief
minister of this state.

1226
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:31,333
And this woman who is
being refused a ticket will..

1227
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:34,125
..be the deputy chief minister.

1228
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,833
The deputy chief minister.

1229
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,625
You don't need to beg for a ticket.

1230
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:42,166
This woman is meant
to distribute tickets.

1231
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:45,500
And nowadays money
is the biggest power.

1232
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:49,458
And she holds the
keys to his treasury.

1233
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:53,666
Now she should act smart and
ask for 50 crores instead of a ticket.

1234
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:54,583
He will give it to her happily.

1235
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:56,708
Not 50 crores, sir.
We are small. A few crores..

1236
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:59,333
We will make do with a few crores too.

1237
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:00,541
Banaram..

1238
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,250
Don't think keeping
in mind your height.

1239
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,750
Think about your courage and demand.

1240
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:07,208
You have the courage of an elephant.

1241
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:09,125
If this woman asks for
100 crores then too he'll..

1242
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,416
..give it with a smile on his face.

1243
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:12,458
But we are not greedy, only 50.

1244
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,875
Think 50 crores from Anokhi Devi.

1245
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:19,250
And I have 40 members with me.

1246
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:26,250
When these two unite,
it will create a drama in Rajasthan.

1247
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:38,875
Welcome, Anokhi Devi.

1248
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,583
You have done something very unique.

1249
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:46,875
A woman doesn't make such CDs.

1250
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:51,208
When a man acts like a streetwalker,
then a woman can do anything.

1251
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,166
You have changed very quickly.

1252
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:56,875
When you can change then so can I.

1253
01:06:57,541 --> 01:07:01,333
You gave Mertha's seat but
in the end announced Mukhtiar's name.

1254
01:07:01,791 --> 01:07:03,958
Don't I have any honour?

1255
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,958
I had my posters
pasted on the streets.

1256
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,416
What do you think of yourself?

1257
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,166
Who are you?

1258
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:12,666
Look, try to understand the matter.

1259
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,583
Mukhtiar is someone
I am helpless about.

1260
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,666
He is illiterate and uncivilised.

1261
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:23,083
He knows a lot of my secrets.
Why do you worry?

1262
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,500
I'll reason it with Mukhtiar
and give him another seat.

1263
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:29,333
Come on now, give me the CD.

1264
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:34,541
If the opposition gets hold of it
then both you and I will get defamed.

1265
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:35,416
Yes.

1266
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:40,291
And if the people see the
CD then you will become famous.

1267
01:07:40,666 --> 01:07:42,375
You will become the C.M.
without putting in any hard work.

1268
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,500
Don't test my patience.

1269
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,583
Give me the CD. It will benefit you.

1270
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:51,041
Fine, take the CD.
And give me 50 crores.

1271
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:57,791
50 crores. You don't
even weigh as much as it does.

1272
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:01,041
You are blackmailing me?

1273
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:03,875
A deal. I am making you a deal.

1274
01:08:04,416 --> 01:08:08,416
When you become the C.M.
you will make 5000-7000 crores.

1275
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:10,541
It's business for both of us.

1276
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:14,333
I can give you 1-2
crores to save my honour.

1277
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:17,041
I will take 50 crores.

1278
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:20,958
You will have to pay dearly for this.
Remember that.

1279
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:22,416
That's what I am saying.

1280
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:25,250
If I become stubborn
then you too will suffer.

1281
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:26,666
Goodbye.

1282
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:31,875
I think we should resolve
this matter peacefully and quietly.

1283
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:36,166
I'll buy her and
grow grass on top of it.

1284
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,666
Threatening me won't help her.

1285
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:42,166
People shoot for me
even before I order them to.

1286
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:44,875
I will get everyone arrested.

1287
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,125
I want my bungalow,
car, everything back.

1288
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,666
She wants 50 crores.

1289
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,750
She isn't even worth 50,000.

1290
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:56,832
Is this the first time
she slept with anyone?

1291
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:00,875
No one will give her
more than 2000 for a night.

1292
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:02,916
Go and reason it with her.

1293
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:07,250
Your problem is that
you act childishly stubborn.

1294
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:13,041
Look, Dinanath has bluntly said that he
will have us begging in the streets.

1295
01:09:13,541 --> 01:09:15,541
Think about it.
Don't get into this mess.

1296
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,791
We cannot make such big moves.

1297
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:23,000
Banaram, a horse never
stops in the middle of a race.

1298
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:27,750
It races till the end,
whether it wins the race or loses it.

1299
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:32,708
Anokhi has on the battlefield,
she cannot back out now.

1300
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:34,875
We will take things as they come.

1301
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,416
Sir, she was very stubborn.

1302
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:38,500
She didn't listen to me,
hence I left her alone.

1303
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:41,250
I don't know anything more than that.

1304
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,500
You don't know or you
don't want to tell me?

1305
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:46,166
When I have told you
everything what's left to hide?

1306
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:48,332
May I? It's urgent.

1307
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:50,083
Go.

1308
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:57,708
Keep an eye on him.
I don't trust him completely.

1309
01:09:58,208 --> 01:09:59,500
Okay, sir. - Yes, sir.

1310
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:02,666
Hello?

1311
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,708
Hello, Mr. Mishra.

1312
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,208
It's me, Dinanath.

1313
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:08,625
Yes, Mr. Dinanath?

1314
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:15,083
The home minister in Delhi,
Rajdeep Singh is my friend.

1315
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:16,875
He is also your friend.

1316
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:19,666
I have a desire to meet you.

1317
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:24,041
Will you come here to meet
me or should I come there to meet you?

1318
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:25,958
You will come here to meet me soon.

1319
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:27,791
For the time being I
will come there to meet you.

1320
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:29,291
As God wills.

1321
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:36,041
Look Mr. Jayant, you help me
now and I'll help you the next time.

1322
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:37,916
Yes of course. I am with you.

1323
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:39,791
Sir, the C.B.I.
officer Mishra is here.

1324
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:41,458
Ask him to come inside.
- Okay.

1325
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:43,791
See you soon, Mr. Jayant.
- Okay.

1326
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,333
Thank you.
- Bye.

1327
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:47,541
Just have some patience.

1328
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:48,041
Yes.

1329
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:48,791
Bye.
- Bye.

1330
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,083
This way, sir.
- Thank you.

1331
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:52,083
Hello.
- Hi.

1332
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:52,583
This way, sir.

1333
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:53,166
Hi.

1334
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:54,708
Welcome.

1335
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:58,458
Hello.
- Hi.

1336
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:01,375
I am so pleased that you came here.

1337
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:04,833
Rajdeep Singh keeps
singing your praises.

1338
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:07,125
He is my childhood friend.

1339
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:09,875
You told me.

1340
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:12,041
Please be comfortable.

1341
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:14,875
How about a cup of tea?

1342
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,625
I don't drink tea.

1343
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,666
Don't worry, I won't poison your tea.

1344
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,333
Poison has no effect on me,
Mr. Dinanath.

1345
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:24,041
Oh

1346
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:30,666
What's that status
of Anokhi Devi's case?

1347
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:32,125
What's the progress of the case?

1348
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:35,250
We are very close to the culprit, sir.

1349
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,500
Arrest him.

1350
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:39,708
I will as soon as you say it.

1351
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,541
Mr. Mishra,
you are getting off the track.

1352
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:50,333
I am trying to befriend you
and you are trying to become my enemy.

1353
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:53,375
You have been investing
for 40 days now.

1354
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:56,250
You have only 20
days before retirement.

1355
01:11:56,708 --> 01:12:00,666
A case can be solved
even in 20 seconds.

1356
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:04,500
It is solved. I just need
to execute the line of action.

1357
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,875
I will give you an advice.

1358
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:16,375
After 20 days you won't
have a beaconed car or any power.

1359
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,875
You will be walking on the streets.

1360
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:24,416
Friends that you make now
will come in handy, not enemies.

1361
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:27,083
Anyway, forget about it.

1362
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:30,291
It's okay if you don't have tea.
How about a cup of coffee?

1363
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:31,958
The next time.

1364
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:36,083
We will have a cup of coffee together,
but in my office.

1365
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:37,708
Bye.

1366
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,250
Yes, Dinanath?

1367
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:47,833
The C.B.I.
officer Mishra will ruin our lives.

1368
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,458
Then let's get rid of Mr. Mishra.

1369
01:12:58,125 --> 01:12:59,625
Sir, you go to the temple everyday?

1370
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:08,166
Those who live with their head held
high should bow down to God sometimes.

1371
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:08,833
Yes, sir.

1372
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:15,208
Sir!

1373
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:15,833
Sir!

1374
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:16,500
Sir!

1375
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:28,458
How much were you
paid to shoot at him?

1376
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:31,333
Tell me!

1377
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,041
10000 rupees, sir.

1378
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:38,166
You will kill someone for 10000?

1379
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:40,250
This is the ongoing
rate in the market.

1380
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,875
If I wouldn't have killed
him someone else would have.

1381
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:48,416
We will help you if you help us.

1382
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:54,333
Now it's up to you.
- Okay, sir.

1383
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,541
Good that you two came here.

1384
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:41,125
You have troubled me a lot.

1385
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:45,541
Don't test my patience.

1386
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,291
Go and get my brothers.

1387
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:48,333
Go.

1388
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:52,541
We are here because of your brothers.

1389
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:55,166
The thing is,
they feel lonely in the lock up.

1390
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:57,291
Hence we are here to get you.

1391
01:15:58,291 --> 01:16:02,375
You two against my army?

1392
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:07,208
Nirbhay Singh?
- Yes, Nishchay Singh?

1393
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:10,625
One Hanuman was enough
to set the Lanka on fire.

1394
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:13,541
There are two of us.
- Yes.

1395
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:17,333
And there are 200
standing outside as well.

1396
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:19,333
Do tell him that, Nishchay Singh.

1397
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:25,708
Look Mukhiar,
bloodshed won't help you.

1398
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:29,708
Act smart and fight us legally.

1399
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:35,000
We are here to arrest you
for Anokhi Devi's murder case.

1400
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,333
And we will arrest you.

1401
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:41,958
Come with us peacefully, sir.

1402
01:16:42,916 --> 01:16:45,291
Otherwise we know how
to take officially. - Yes.

1403
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:02,083
I won't ask whether
or not you know Anokhi Devi.

1404
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:06,500
Because I know you killed her.

1405
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:10,375
I am interested in the
people who instigated you for it.

1406
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:14,416
I want to end the crime
and criminal from the root.

1407
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:15,958
You have two options.

1408
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:21,208
If you help us then we
might be able to help you.

1409
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:26,125
But if we go to court,
before the court decides a..

1410
01:17:26,916 --> 01:17:34,125
..death sentence for Anokhi Devi's
murder, I'll kill you personally.

1411
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,083
You have to make the decision.

1412
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:44,125
Is it a yes or a no?

1413
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:55,541
Out!

1414
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:05,750
They are your brothers, right?

1415
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:07,791
They have confessed everything.

1416
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:11,333
He accepted defeat
even before the fight.

1417
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:15,666
How can he be my brother?

1418
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:17,750
Take them away.

1419
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:22,791
They've given a statement
that you have killed Anokhi Devi.

1420
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,625
It's over, everything's settled.

1421
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:30,000
Why are you so worried
when you know everything?

1422
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:35,666
Close the file. Take me to court.
That's all I am saying.

1423
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:41,583
Not to the court, we will
send you up there, Mukhiar Singh.

1424
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:47,041
Our sir has decided that we will
do your justice, and not the court.

1425
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:50,458
I have brought a
return ticket with me.

1426
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:52,333
Mukhtiar!
- Yes, sir.

1427
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:56,333
We will shove your attitude!

1428
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,041
It's said that the brawns
are killed by the fools.

1429
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:06,541
We can get your killed
by any ordinary man.

1430
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:11,250
We have many people.
- Anything else?

1431
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:18,875
This way, sir.

1432
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,833
What's the progress
on Anokhi Devi's case?

1433
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:22,250
We are very close
to the destination, sir.

1434
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:24,500
You are brave and talented.
- Thank you, sir.

1435
01:19:25,166 --> 01:19:25,708
This way.

1436
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:29,125
Hello.
- Hi.

1437
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,333
Come, Mr. Manoj Singh.

1438
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,416
I tried meeting you but
I came know that you had gone out.

1439
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:36,625
Yes, I had gone to my
village to meet my mother.

1440
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,416
Okay. Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

1441
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:45,375
You've troubled the government
with Anokhi Devi's case.

1442
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:49,333
In spite of knowing
that well-known goons and..

1443
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:51,458
..politicians have been
linked with Anokhi Devi's case..

1444
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:56,500
So, you didn't feel scared
to raise your voice against them?

1445
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:59,875
Look, everyone has to die one day.

1446
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:03,583
Death has been very generous to me.

1447
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:06,625
It has knocked on my door
a number of times and returned.

1448
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,500
You are an interesting person.

1449
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:12,208
I have heard a lot about you.

1450
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:13,875
Tea, sir.
Thank you. Shall I make it for you?

1451
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:14,916
Keep it here. You may leave.

1452
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:16,208
Okay, sir.
- Thank you.

1453
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:20,208
I cannot solve this
case without your help.

1454
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:22,666
You please continue.
- Tell me how I can help you.

1455
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,750
The information Anokhi Devi
gave you about Mukhtiar Singh..

1456
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:29,291
I would like to hear that.

1457
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:30,416
Sure. Just a minute.

1458
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:35,833
Here you go.

1459
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:36,666
Listen.

1460
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,666
'Hello, I am Anokhi.
I think Mukhtiar will kill me.'

1461
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:44,291
'If anything happens to me release
the CD, give it to the police.'

1462
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:48,500
What happened next?

1463
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:53,583
Either someone took the
phone from her or it fell.

1464
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:55,458
Did she mention a CD?

1465
01:20:55,916 --> 01:21:00,541
She was going to tell
me the details of the CD but..

1466
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,458
Do you have any CD?
- No.

1467
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:05,208
But Anokhi Devi has a bank locker.

1468
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:07,625
Geeta has the key of the locker.

1469
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:10,166
Perhaps that CD is
in that bank locker.

1470
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:14,250
Geeta..

1471
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:19,166
Does Anokhi Devi have a bank locker?

1472
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,708
Yes, I have the locker number.

1473
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:24,708
There must be a CD in it.
I want that CD. - Okay.

1474
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:40,291
Yes, I understood.
I need to give way to him, right?

1475
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:43,750
Darling, your demands never end.

1476
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:47,208
Fine. Don't worry.
I will get whatever you want.

1477
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:50,833
Let's go for a movie in the evening.

1478
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:54,166
Wear the skirt I gifted
you on your birthday.

1479
01:21:54,291 --> 01:21:54,875
Okay?

1480
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:59,000
Tell your mother that
you have extra classes.

1481
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:01,916
Anyway, your mother is very naïve.
She won't say anything.

1482
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:05,250
Hang up. You will get me killed.

1483
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,625
What are you doing, son?

1484
01:22:09,083 --> 01:22:12,041
You are talking on the
phone while riding a motorcycle.

1485
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,125
You will die and also
get others into trouble.

1486
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:19,083
Stop at the side and talk at leisure.
- Yes, sir.

1487
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:52,291
I am letting him pass.
Bang into him.

1488
01:22:52,416 --> 01:22:53,750
Yes, let him come.

1489
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:20,541
Sir!

1490
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,041
He's bleeding profusely.

1491
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,875
Hurry up. He is badly hurt.

1492
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:48,041
Doctor, my father?

1493
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:49,375
He is fine.

1494
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:51,750
I have given him something
to help him sleep.

1495
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:53,125
Go home and rest.

1496
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:55,000
No, I will stay here with him.

1497
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:56,916
Look, you have been
worried since morning.

1498
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:58,291
We are here to take care of him.

1499
01:23:58,541 --> 01:23:59,750
Go. Come in the morning.

1500
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,291
Are you sleepy?
- No, sir.

1501
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:10,666
But you look like you want to sleep.

1502
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,208
Go.
- No, sir. We weren't sleeping.

1503
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:13,666
Go and wash your face.
Go and have tea.

1504
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:15,041
Go and have tea. Go.

1505
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:16,000
Let's go.

1506
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:48,041
Karan Singh..!

1507
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:50,083
You!

1508
01:24:59,666 --> 01:25:03,750
The greed for power and
money has made you a scoundrel.

1509
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:08,541
What you did is legally
termed as an attempt to murder.

1510
01:25:08,958 --> 01:25:12,166
And the police department
could've killed you for that.

1511
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:14,500
I too could've done that..

1512
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:18,750
. but I didn't want your
impure body to be covered..

1513
01:25:19,416 --> 01:25:21,291
..with the Indian flag after you die.

1514
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:24,166
I didn't want police
department to officially..

1515
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:25,958
.. mourn after your death and
the flag to be lowered to half-mast.

1516
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:31,625
It would've been an
insult to our national flag.

1517
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:35,916
Nirbhay, take off his uniform.

1518
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:40,166
Come on.

1519
01:25:55,333 --> 01:26:00,500
'There will be a day when we
will either surrender our uniforms..'

1520
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:05,958
'Or make sure you
are stripped of yours.'

1521
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,125
Sorry, sir.
I won't be able to do it.

1522
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:32,208
Hello, Mr. Manoj Singh.

1523
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,375
It's me, Dinanath.

1524
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:38,041
I have sent Rs 2 lakhs
for your treatment.

1525
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,791
Don't hesitate if you need more.

1526
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:44,500
You inflict the wound
and then you tend to it.

1527
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,125
It's God's will.

1528
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:51,208
Take it away.

1529
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:54,958
It will help him put up
some more hoardings. - Okay.

1530
01:26:56,708 --> 01:26:58,375
Keep the flowers.
- Okay.

1531
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:02,500
Banaram said that he left
Anokhi Devi near Tiloraha.

1532
01:27:02,916 --> 01:27:05,583
And the last call she made
was from somewhere near Tiloraha.

1533
01:27:08,125 --> 01:27:11,375
Here, sir. Pipping hot
tea with cream made by Pintu.

1534
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:14,250
It will make you crazy.

1535
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,041
Have you added opium in it?

1536
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:17,708
Why will I add opium to it, sir?
- Have a seat.

1537
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:19,958
It's okay.
- Have a seat, don't act funny.

1538
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:21,416
It's okay, sir.
- Sit!

1539
01:27:21,791 --> 01:27:24,500
Don't shout. I feel scared.

1540
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,458
Pintu..
- Yes?

1541
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:30,958
Are you on duty at
night as well? - Yes.

1542
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:35,458
Did a woman come here on the night
of 1st July, almost 1 ½ month ago?

1543
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,708
Sir, men and women come here everyday.

1544
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:39,041
Who all can I pay attention to?

1545
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:43,000
Did something unusual take place?
Think about it.

1546
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,208
Look at this. This woman.

1547
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,583
Yes, sir.
I remember. She looked like her.

1548
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,416
Some goons took her away.

1549
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,500
Who were they?
Have you seen them before?

1550
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,625
Will you be able to recognise them?

1551
01:27:58,875 --> 01:28:01,875
I don't recognise them
but I recognise the car.

1552
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:04,916
It keeps coming to Mr.
Dinanath's farmhouse.

1553
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:06,416
Where is the farmhouse?

1554
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:10,041
Hello?

1555
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:11,666
Sir, it's Nirbhay Singh.

1556
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:13,208
There is a roadside
eatery near the highway.

1557
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:15,291
Some goons took her from there.

1558
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,458
Where are you now?

1559
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,875
We are going to Dinanath's farm house.

1560
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:21,833
Call me if necessary.
- Yes, sir.

1561
01:28:57,166 --> 01:28:58,208
Stop.

1562
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:10,583
'This could be Anokhi's mobile.'

1563
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:12,916
Constable.
- Yes..

1564
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,041
Yes, sir.

1565
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:15,000
Sir..

1566
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,916
Come here. Dig here.

1567
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:41,833
You want a cigarette?

1568
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,000
No, I don't smoke cigarettes.

1569
01:29:43,333 --> 01:29:47,291
Oh, I forgot. You smoke
Bedi (local cigarette), right?

1570
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:49,750
Here, I'll give you the brand you use.

1571
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:56,125
It's bad to smoke.
But a lot of people smoke this brand.

1572
01:30:02,083 --> 01:30:03,958
You used this stick
to light it, right?

1573
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:06,333
We found this Bedi and this stick..

1574
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,083
.. from the place where you
killed and cremated Anokhi Devi.

1575
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:15,208
There's more. This stick and these
pieces have your fingerprints on them.

1576
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:18,916
I killed her with
the stick or the Bedi?

1577
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:22,041
Fine, assume I accept that
there are my fingerprints on them.

1578
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,541
But with this how can you prove..

1579
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:27,791
.. that if Anokhi Devi is dead,
I have killed her?

1580
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:29,208
Mukhtiar!

1581
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:34,208
Hello?
- Nirbhay, I want to see you.

1582
01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:37,250
Yes, sir.

1583
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:39,208
Okay, sir.
- Come over.

1584
01:30:46,791 --> 01:30:47,916
So, did you say anything?

1585
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:50,708
No, sir. He's a hardcore.

1586
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:53,416
Anokhi Devi has been
killed and then cremated.

1587
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:55,125
They must have brought
the timber from somewhere.

1588
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:57,708
Find out if there
is any sawmill close by.

1589
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:00,500
Okay, sir.
- Can you explain it to me again?

1590
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:11,833
Did any of them come on the
night of 1st to take some timber?

1591
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:15,916
I don't remember.
- Look carefully.

1592
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:18,833
The one with the yellow turban, sir.

1593
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:20,625
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir. He came at night.

1594
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,083
He woke me up to get it.

1595
01:31:22,625 --> 01:31:24,500
They took 8 tons of wood.

1596
01:31:24,916 --> 01:31:25,416
Okay.

1597
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:28,125
One of them came
back after two hours.

1598
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:30,208
He used my mobile.
- Really?

1599
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:30,833
Yes, sir.

1600
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:33,916
Okay. Thank you.

1601
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,166
Sir, my mobile?

1602
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:38,375
Don't worry.
I will give it back. Okay?

1603
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:41,333
Sir, it's me. Nathulal.

1604
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:43,125
There's some important news.

1605
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:46,291
They are taking Mukhtiar
to court tomorrow morning.

1606
01:31:53,083 --> 01:31:54,708
Jabber Singh.

1607
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:56,458
Yes, Mr. Dayal?

1608
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:07,125
Long live..
- Mukhtiar Singh!

1609
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:10,125
Long live..
- Mukhtiar Singh!

1610
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:11,958
Long live..
- Mukhtiar!

1611
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:13,791
Long live..
- Mukhtiar!

1612
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:15,583
Long live..
- Mukhtiar Singh!

1613
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:17,666
Long live..
- Mukhtiar Singh!

1614
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:19,208
Long live..
- Mukhtiar Singh!

1615
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:21,750
Long live..
- Mukhtiar Singh!

1616
01:32:21,958 --> 01:32:24,666
Long live..
- Mukhtiar Singh!

1617
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:27,000
Long live..
- Mukhtiar Singh!

1618
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:44,083
Don't let him escape!

1619
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,041
Lord..

1620
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:16,000
I am going to court. Call me
if something urgent comes up. - Okay.

1621
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:16,875
Hello?

1622
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:19,875
Sir, someone court
at Mukhtiar in the court.

1623
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:20,958
What?

1624
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:22,000
Yes, sir.

1625
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:25,625
I didn't kill Mukhtiar,
I got him killed.

1626
01:33:26,708 --> 01:33:30,041
Mukhtiar wasn't my father's
son that I would act as his brother.

1627
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:32,500
He would go to court and confess..

1628
01:33:32,625 --> 01:33:35,000
..that I killed Anokhi
Devi at Dinanath's behest.

1629
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:36,375
What would've happened then?

1630
01:33:38,166 --> 01:33:40,041
I got rid of the obstacle.

1631
01:33:42,291 --> 01:33:44,666
Mukhtiar Singh killed Anokhi Devi.

1632
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:46,541
Now that Mukhtiar is dead..

1633
01:33:47,958 --> 01:33:51,583
.. the law cannot do us
any harm in Anokhi murder case.

1634
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,208
I am your friend.

1635
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:58,000
I have been true to our friendship.

1636
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,333
Do one thing..

1637
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:08,041
Send Rs. 2 crores to Jabber
Singh through your secretary.

1638
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:12,666
Tell him.

1639
01:34:13,166 --> 01:34:15,000
Sharma.
- Yes, sir?

1640
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:17,208
Arrange for 2 crores rupees.
- Okay, sir.

1641
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:19,458
Hello?

1642
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:20,958
Sir, I have some important news.

1643
01:34:21,083 --> 01:34:23,416
I want to tell you something
about Mukhtiar Singh's murder.

1644
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:24,291
Who are you?

1645
01:34:24,583 --> 01:34:25,500
That's not important.

1646
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:29,708
Dinanath and Dayal got Mukhtiar
murdered through Jabber Singh.

1647
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:32,875
Dinanath's secretary is going
to pay Rs. 2 crores for that.

1648
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:35,125
Jabber Singh is at
Masudha's farmhouse.

1649
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:36,875
This is the right information, sir.

1650
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:37,750
Hello?

1651
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:39,791
Who are you?

1652
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:42,000
I am Dinanath's secretary.

1653
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:44,791
Mr. Dayal has sent
Rs. 2 crores for you.

1654
01:34:45,416 --> 01:34:46,375
Mr. Dayal..

1655
01:36:15,166 --> 01:36:16,333
Who killed Mukhtiar?

1656
01:36:16,833 --> 01:36:18,875
How many times will you ask me that?

1657
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

1658
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:26,375
At Mr. Dayal's behest
I killed Mukhtiar..

1659
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:30,791
You are lying.

1660
01:36:32,666 --> 01:36:37,500
Dinanath's secretary gave you
Rs. 2 crores at your place.

1661
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:38,291
Right?

1662
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:52,125
No one's name is printed
on the money, sir.

1663
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:57,000
I only know Dayal.
I don't know any Dinanath.

1664
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:59,958
You won't gain anything by hitting me.

1665
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:02,666
I am telling the truth.

1666
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:06,500
I killed him at Dayal's behest.

1667
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:07,583
Sir..

1668
01:37:09,458 --> 01:37:11,416
It's possible that
Dayal got him killed but

1669
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,708
sent the money through
Dinanath's secretary.

1670
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:20,250
It's possible that Dayal and
Dinanath has some personal issues.

1671
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:24,958
You never really know
with these politicians.

1672
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:30,083
I think he's just
a pawn of their politics.

1673
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:31,041
That's all.

1674
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:47,291
Mr. Mishra! What brings you here!

1675
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,291
I was just passing by when I thought..

1676
01:37:51,041 --> 01:37:52,791
.. I should pay homage
to this sacred place.

1677
01:37:53,166 --> 01:37:54,458
And atone for my sins.

1678
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,666
You and sins?

1679
01:37:58,125 --> 01:38:01,250
You are what your name suggests.

1680
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:04,333
You cannot commit any sin.

1681
01:38:05,291 --> 01:38:07,541
Mr. Dayal, one feels bad..

1682
01:38:07,666 --> 01:38:11,125
.. when unknowingly hurts
feelings of someone like you.

1683
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,750
What is this prayer for?
- To atone for my sins.

1684
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:17,791
Like you.

1685
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:19,333
You made mistakes?

1686
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:21,083
It's life, Mr. Mishra.

1687
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:22,416
It's difficult.

1688
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:26,625
You unwillingly need to get rid
of people to make way for yourself.

1689
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:31,375
Everyone makes mistakes.
Hence one has to atone.

1690
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:33,333
Now that you are here..

1691
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:36,333
.. why not put a few drops of
pure clarified butter into the fire?

1692
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:38,833
It will purify the fire.

1693
01:38:39,625 --> 01:38:40,458
Please come with me.

1694
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:42,291
Priest..

1695
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,958
Please, this way. Have a seat.

1696
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:46,166
Pray for Mr. Mishra's long life.

1697
01:38:46,375 --> 01:38:47,000
Take this offering.

1698
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:49,916
And if needed,
give the years left in my life to him.

1699
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:50,875
Great.

1700
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:53,208
You are doing politics here as well.

1701
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:59,000
You are giving me the years
left in your life, that too if needed.

1702
01:39:00,916 --> 01:39:03,666
Okay, I've given the offering.
I'll make a move now.

1703
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,416
Priest..
- Yes?

1704
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,208
Please continue.
I'll escort him and be right back.

1705
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:07,958
Okay.
- Let's go.

1706
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:08,458
Bye.
- Let's go.

1707
01:39:14,666 --> 01:39:17,250
Mr. Mishra,
I cannot tell you how happy I am.

1708
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:19,958
I stay close by.
Please come with me for a cup of tea.

1709
01:39:20,375 --> 01:39:21,708
No, I am getting late.

1710
01:39:22,166 --> 01:39:24,333
I have a meeting with the C.M.
in the evening. - Okay.

1711
01:39:24,416 --> 01:39:25,875
I have prepared Anokhi Devi's file.

1712
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:26,875
I need to show it to him.

1713
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:29,458
This dirty business will continue,
Mr. Mishra.

1714
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:34,125
There's a saying in the
Era of Third you got buttermilk..

1715
01:39:34,208 --> 01:39:36,208
..in the era of Second
you got clarified butter.

1716
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:39,625
In the dark era, all you get is tea,
so have it whenever you are free.

1717
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:41,083
You should at least
have one cup of tea.

1718
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:42,500
Who penned that?

1719
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:45,750
It's nice.
- Sometimes..

1720
01:39:46,458 --> 01:39:50,458
I drove my own car so I..

1721
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,166
That's even better.
I'll come in your car.

1722
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:56,958
My life will be in your
hands and we will reach home safe.

1723
01:39:57,041 --> 01:39:57,500
Let's go.

1724
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:03,250
Hello?
- Sir, it's me. Nathulal.

1725
01:40:03,416 --> 01:40:04,750
Yes, Nathulal. What happened?

1726
01:40:04,875 --> 01:40:08,791
The new C.B.I.
officer has arrested Mr. Dayal.

1727
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,916
He has brought him to his office.

1728
01:40:10,458 --> 01:40:12,541
Damn.. Okay, I will come.

1729
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:15,125
I praise not your cleverness
but your smartness.

1730
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:17,000
That you didn't publicly arrest me.

1731
01:40:18,708 --> 01:40:23,416
There would've been a lot of bloodshed
if you would've arrested me publicly.

1732
01:40:24,333 --> 01:40:26,791
I had a desire to have tea with you,
Mr. Mishra.

1733
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:28,291
If not there then let's have it here.

1734
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:29,875
Offer me a cup of tea, please.

1735
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:32,250
Send in a cup of tea.
- Okay, sir.

1736
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:36,875
Anokhi Devi was a
member of your party.

1737
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
You don't feel sorrow
because she is missing?

1738
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:43,083
I have used all my
power to find her, sir.

1739
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,583
I made sure that the
case goes to the C.B.I.

1740
01:40:49,083 --> 01:40:50,916
I pressurized the C.M.
and brought you here.

1741
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:53,958
You did me a huge favour.

1742
01:40:57,458 --> 01:40:59,083
Now do me another favour.

1743
01:41:00,125 --> 01:41:05,750
Just let me know whether
Anokhi Devi is dead or alive.

1744
01:41:06,291 --> 01:41:07,083
Oh God.

1745
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:14,291
Mr. Dayal, your betterment
lies in telling me the truth.

1746
01:41:14,708 --> 01:41:19,708
Go and tell him that Janseva
party's leader Dinanath is here.

1747
01:41:19,833 --> 01:41:21,958
Yes, sir.
I'll tell him that right away.

1748
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:24,958
Why do you need to think over it?

1749
01:41:25,041 --> 01:41:26,083
Tea, sir?
- Give it to him.

1750
01:41:26,291 --> 01:41:27,000
Okay.

1751
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:29,750
Sir, Janseva Party's leader
Mr. Dinanath is waiting outside.

1752
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:30,458
Shall I send him in?

1753
01:41:30,583 --> 01:41:31,208
Make him sit outside.

1754
01:41:32,666 --> 01:41:34,041
Make him wait.
- Okay.

1755
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:39,083
Did you tell him?
- Yes.

1756
01:41:39,958 --> 01:41:41,000
He has asked you to have a seat.

1757
01:41:41,125 --> 01:41:44,125
I have been sitting since
the past half an hour. - Yes.

1758
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:48,708
Did you tell him Janseva
Party's leader Mr. Dinanath is here?

1759
01:41:48,875 --> 01:41:50,375
I said exactly that, sir.

1760
01:41:50,458 --> 01:41:55,458
That Janseva Party's leader respected
Mr. Dinanath is waiting outside.

1761
01:41:55,625 --> 01:41:57,291
But it made no difference to him.

1762
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,833
He is in a meeting, sir.

1763
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:01,166
Who is in there? The prime minister?

1764
01:42:01,625 --> 01:42:03,458
Mr. Dayal is here.
- So?

1765
01:42:03,583 --> 01:42:06,125
He said if you wish to wait
then you can otherwise you may leave.

1766
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:07,250
Leave.
- Okay.

1767
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:10,416
Shall I get tea for you?
- Let the tea go to hell!

1768
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:13,041
What nonsense is this!

1769
01:42:14,166 --> 01:42:16,166
I have been waiting
since the past half an hour!

1770
01:42:17,083 --> 01:42:20,875
You don't have ten minutes
for Janseva Party's leader?

1771
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:22,458
Are you such a big officer?

1772
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:26,958
I make and break the fate
of officers like you every day.

1773
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:30,291
Enough. You won't say a word more.

1774
01:42:30,375 --> 01:42:31,250
What will you do?

1775
01:42:31,416 --> 01:42:34,708
We will arrest you for misbehaving
with an government official.

1776
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:35,833
Relax.

1777
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:42,125
We won't arrest you for a pity crime.

1778
01:42:43,083 --> 01:42:44,625
We won't make the mistake
of arresting you in the..

1779
01:42:44,708 --> 01:42:45,875
..morning and releasing
you in the evening.

1780
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:50,541
We will send you to prison for sure,
but for a lifetime.

1781
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:52,666
Oh really?

1782
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:57,750
Then you wait for that day
and that moment all your life.

1783
01:42:58,875 --> 01:43:02,291
Scoundrel is a little
educated and he thinks he's..

1784
01:43:04,291 --> 01:43:06,083
I have spoken to the solicitor.
- Okay, sir.

1785
01:43:06,291 --> 01:43:07,583
Go and introduce them.
- Okay, sir.

1786
01:43:07,708 --> 01:43:08,708
Let's go.
- Let's go.

1787
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:33,375
Mr. Mishra, you should reconsider your
decision before arresting Dinanath.

1788
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:37,041
Dinanath has a strong hold
on the people from his own caste.

1789
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:40,333
His arrest can cause a law
and order situation in the state.

1790
01:43:40,416 --> 01:43:41,833
Sir, I have all the proofs.

1791
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:45,875
Right from making Anokhi Devi
disappear to getting her killed..

1792
01:43:46,208 --> 01:43:48,375
From killing her to
destroying all evidences..

1793
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:50,875
Dinanath and Dayal
are behind this, sir.

1794
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:55,583
Trust me.
I'll take care of everything.

1795
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:05,416
Hello?

1796
01:44:05,708 --> 01:44:07,875
Hello, sir.
Mr. Mishra is waiting downstairs.

1797
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,958
Is he alone? - Not alone. He
has brought a police force with him.

1798
01:44:11,875 --> 01:44:13,041
Okay, let him come.

1799
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:27,291
Hello.

1800
01:44:27,625 --> 01:44:29,250
You must be surprised to see me here.

1801
01:44:30,041 --> 01:44:30,625
Please continue eating.

1802
01:44:30,708 --> 01:44:32,625
Do join me.
- No, thank you.

1803
01:44:33,625 --> 01:44:35,416
You have brought
a police force with you.

1804
01:44:36,875 --> 01:44:37,791
To arrest me.

1805
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:40,000
You have brought a warrant with you?

1806
01:44:40,291 --> 01:44:41,166
I am the warrant.

1807
01:44:42,208 --> 01:44:46,250
When I want to arrest someone,
I issue the warrant on the spot.

1808
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:50,416
All the evidences in Anokhi
Devi's case are against you.

1809
01:44:51,666 --> 01:44:54,416
Keep your phone down
and come with me peacefully.

1810
01:44:58,291 --> 01:45:00,250
There will be no peace.

1811
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:03,583
This will cause an
upheaval in the state!

1812
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,708
It is not a joke to arrest Dinanath.

1813
01:45:10,125 --> 01:45:10,666
Yes, tell me.

1814
01:45:11,083 --> 01:45:12,041
What are the orders for us?

1815
01:45:12,208 --> 01:45:13,625
Stay downstairs.
- Okay.

1816
01:45:13,916 --> 01:45:14,958
I am getting him.

1817
01:45:16,958 --> 01:45:18,416
Finish your meal then we will leave.

1818
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:20,666
'In Anokhi Devi's case C.B.I.
officer..

1819
01:45:20,833 --> 01:45:25,083
..Satyaprakash Mishra has
arrested Dinanath and Dayal.'

1820
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:27,958
'They will be presented
in front of the court tomorrow.'

1821
01:45:28,333 --> 01:45:33,416
'Apart from being a C.B.I. officer
Satyaprakash Mishra is also a lawyer.'

1822
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:38,750
'He has sought permission from the
court to fight Anokhi Devi's case.'

1823
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:40,708
'It rained a little
in Jodhpur today..'

1824
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:43,000
Release our leader!

1825
01:45:43,166 --> 01:45:45,041
Release our leader!

1826
01:45:45,166 --> 01:45:46,916
Release our leader!

1827
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:48,916
Release our leader!

1828
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:51,000
Release our leader!

1829
01:45:51,125 --> 01:45:53,416
Release our leader!

1830
01:45:53,541 --> 01:45:55,458
Release our leader!

1831
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,791
Release our leader or
I will set myself on fire.

1832
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:02,333
Release our leader!

1833
01:46:02,416 --> 01:46:04,208
Release our leader!

1834
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:06,333
Release our leader!

1835
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:08,208
Release our leader!

1836
01:46:08,333 --> 01:46:10,125
Release our leader!

1837
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:12,541
Release our leader or
I will set myself on fire.

1838
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:16,458
Long live..
- Mr. Dinanath.

1839
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:17,625
You want to set
yourself on fire right?

1840
01:46:18,083 --> 01:46:19,791
Go ahead.
- No, sir. No.

1841
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:21,416
What is your name?

1842
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:23,666
Satya.

1843
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,166
Do you know him? Do you?

1844
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:29,958
No, sir. No.

1845
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:35,083
Do you know him?

1846
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:40,375
Mishra, everyone in
the state is my devotee.

1847
01:46:40,458 --> 01:46:42,333
I cannot know everyone's names.

1848
01:46:42,958 --> 01:46:43,458
You heard him?

1849
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,291
He doesn't know you.
You don't know him.

1850
01:46:50,291 --> 01:46:52,750
But yet you want to
kill yourself for him.

1851
01:46:54,333 --> 01:46:56,083
This is the problem with
the people of this country.

1852
01:46:57,416 --> 01:47:00,416
A common man is ready
to die for his leader.

1853
01:47:01,291 --> 01:47:06,125
But post independence has any leader
sacrificed his life for a common man?

1854
01:47:07,833 --> 01:47:08,875
You want to be a hero?

1855
01:47:13,208 --> 01:47:13,791
Let's go.

1856
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:20,250
Long live..
- Mr. Dayal!

1857
01:47:20,375 --> 01:47:22,250
Long live..
- Mr. Dayal!

1858
01:47:25,333 --> 01:47:28,458
Mr. Dinanath..
- You are eternal!

1859
01:47:28,791 --> 01:47:32,041
Milord, these are records
of Anokhi Devi's case.

1860
01:47:33,041 --> 01:47:36,833
This states how Anokhi Devi
became a part of Mr. Dinanath's life.

1861
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:42,375
And how Mr. Dinanath got fed
up of her and tried to get rid of her.

1862
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:46,458
Anokhi Devi was a singer and dancer.

1863
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:49,416
She met Mr. Dinanath in a function.

1864
01:47:50,666 --> 01:47:53,875
Anokhi Devi's moves
made him go crazy about her.

1865
01:47:55,041 --> 01:48:00,041
And to fulfil his lust, he
started making false promises to her.

1866
01:48:00,291 --> 01:48:03,875
He even offered her M.L.A.'s
seat of Mertha to her.

1867
01:48:04,833 --> 01:48:09,833
It caused a problem when Mukhtiar Singh
too decided to contest from Mertha.

1868
01:48:10,416 --> 01:48:15,416
Now Mr. Dinanath was sandwiched between
Mukhtiar Singh and Anokhi Devi.

1869
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:17,291
Am I right, Mr. Dayal?

1870
01:48:17,583 --> 01:48:18,583
It was something like that.

1871
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:23,083
Milord, unwillingly
Mr. Dinanath had to..

1872
01:48:23,666 --> 01:48:27,375
..give Mertha's M.L.A.'s
seat to Mukhtiar.

1873
01:48:28,166 --> 01:48:30,375
Anokhi Devi was a
smart and a clever woman.

1874
01:48:30,458 --> 01:48:33,750
She knew that Mukhtiar knows
a lot of Mr. Dinanath's secrets.

1875
01:48:33,958 --> 01:48:34,791
And this is the reason
why this happened.

1876
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:38,125
Hence she too tried
to ground her roots.

1877
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:43,416
She captured their
intimate moments in a CD.

1878
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:47,416
She used that CD to pressurize Mr.
Dinanath.

1879
01:48:47,708 --> 01:48:48,708
This is what had happened,
right, Mr. Dayal?

1880
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:51,250
Yes, she had started blackmailing him.

1881
01:48:52,375 --> 01:48:53,375
I object, milord.

1882
01:48:54,458 --> 01:49:01,166
The counsel is forcing Mr. Dayal to
concur instead of questing Mr. Dinanath.

1883
01:49:02,375 --> 01:49:06,083
He is very cleverly trying
to make his points strong.

1884
01:49:06,333 --> 01:49:09,708
All fictitious stories are
being presented in this court.

1885
01:49:10,125 --> 01:49:12,458
That Mr. Dinanath was
like this and like that.

1886
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:14,375
I accept, no matter how
Mr. Dinanath was.

1887
01:49:14,833 --> 01:49:18,125
But the question is
if there is any evidence..

1888
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:21,041
..against Mr.
Dinanath and Mr. Dayal because..

1889
01:49:21,583 --> 01:49:24,208
..of which they are brought to this
court then he should present them.

1890
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:27,541
I'd like your permission
to call Banaram to court, sir.

1891
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:36,333
Hello, sir.

1892
01:49:38,125 --> 01:49:41,250
Sir, I am Anokhi Devi's secretary.

1893
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:44,583
And I have committed a sin.

1894
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:47,541
I should help you kill Anokhi Devi?

1895
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,458
No way! I will die
but never do that for you.

1896
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:53,375
Mukhtiar has sent
10 lakh rupees for you.

1897
01:49:54,416 --> 01:49:56,708
Either your life or your sister's.

1898
01:49:59,083 --> 01:50:00,583
What is it, Banaram?
You are not hungry?

1899
01:50:01,166 --> 01:50:02,166
I am not in the mood.

1900
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:07,458
What do you think,
will Dinanath pay me?

1901
01:50:08,791 --> 01:50:11,583
Anokhi, what we are
doing is not right.

1902
01:50:11,833 --> 01:50:15,458
Let's get out of this Dinanath mess.

1903
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:18,666
Otherwise they will get rid of us.

1904
01:50:19,166 --> 01:50:20,291
Try to understand what I am saying.

1905
01:50:24,166 --> 01:50:24,416
Hello?

1906
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:28,541
Brother! Save me, brother.
Mukhtiar's brothers will kill me.

1907
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:32,250
They are very dangerous.
Please save me, brother.

1908
01:50:32,583 --> 01:50:34,125
Brother! Please save me.

1909
01:50:34,291 --> 01:50:38,416
I am talking to her, sir.
I am with her.

1910
01:50:38,791 --> 01:50:42,416
I am talking about you. Don't worry.

1911
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:43,625
I am talking to her.

1912
01:50:46,166 --> 01:50:48,708
Minister!
This minister isn't trustworthy.

1913
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:52,041
I will decide when
and where I want the money.

1914
01:50:52,375 --> 01:50:55,500
We'll take the money first
and give the CD after two days.

1915
01:50:55,666 --> 01:50:58,125
Ask him whether he is okay with it.

1916
01:51:01,583 --> 01:51:02,166
Hello?

1917
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,500
What have you decided?

1918
01:51:04,458 --> 01:51:08,708
Look sir,
what you are doing is not right.

1919
01:51:09,416 --> 01:51:10,291
Hear this..

1920
01:51:10,916 --> 01:51:13,833
Listen, I have spoken to madam.

1921
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:17,166
We'll take the money tomorrow
and give the CD after two days.

1922
01:51:17,416 --> 01:51:20,250
If you are okay with it then tell me,
I'll bring her with me.

1923
01:51:20,791 --> 01:51:24,750
No, I'll.. I'll bring her with me.

1924
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,416
I got scared for my sister's
life and handed Anokhi to Mukhtiar.

1925
01:51:31,916 --> 01:51:34,416
Sir, they got my Anokhi Devi killed.

1926
01:51:35,333 --> 01:51:36,541
Who killed her?

1927
01:51:36,708 --> 01:51:37,583
They did?

1928
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:40,708
That means you had handed
over Anokhi Devi to them.

1929
01:51:40,916 --> 01:51:41,250
Right?

1930
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:44,375
No. Mukhtiar's brothers took her.

1931
01:51:44,458 --> 01:51:47,083
Then how can you say
that they killed her?

1932
01:51:47,458 --> 01:51:51,458
Whereas you just said that
Mukhtiar Khan's brothers took her.

1933
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:53,291
Right?
- Yes.

1934
01:51:53,916 --> 01:51:59,208
Milord, this is the
phone we got at the sawmill.

1935
01:51:59,583 --> 01:52:02,416
Mukhtiar Singh called
Karan Singh from this phone.

1936
01:52:03,166 --> 01:52:06,291
And Karan Singh called
Mr. Dinanath from his phone.

1937
01:52:06,791 --> 01:52:13,416
This call was made at 4:15am and the
duration of the call was 15 seconds.

1938
01:52:13,791 --> 01:52:17,125
And anyone can say
"the job is done" in 15 seconds.

1939
01:52:17,416 --> 01:52:19,875
This is the report. Thank you.

1940
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:25,875
You may go.

1941
01:52:41,291 --> 01:52:48,083
Milord, Mukhtiar Singh had called
me and said that the job is done.

1942
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:51,458
And then I called Mr.
Dinanath that the job is done.

1943
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:55,625
We were all involved in
getting Anokhi Devi disappeared.

1944
01:52:56,833 --> 01:53:00,458
I did injustice to my uniform
and I've been punished for that.

1945
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:01,958
Milord..

1946
01:53:02,458 --> 01:53:04,375
I didn't force her.

1947
01:53:04,625 --> 01:53:06,166
She is blackmailing me.

1948
01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:09,166
Anyway, let bygones be bygones.

1949
01:53:09,583 --> 01:53:11,166
The elections are around the corner.

1950
01:53:11,666 --> 01:53:14,958
I'll be ruined if the
opposition gets hold of that CD.

1951
01:53:15,708 --> 01:53:17,750
I want that CD at any cost.

1952
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:21,500
How will getting one CD help?
She will have a master copy.

1953
01:53:21,625 --> 01:53:23,000
She can make 10-20
more copies from it.

1954
01:53:23,375 --> 01:53:25,458
Mukhtiar Singh is right, Dinanath.

1955
01:53:26,333 --> 01:53:30,333
Hence we need to make amends.

1956
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,791
Do one thing, announce Anokhi
Devi's name for Mertha's seat.

1957
01:53:35,708 --> 01:53:39,083
Mukhtiar Singh's roguery
is well known across Rajasthan.

1958
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,125
He will win from anywhere he stands.

1959
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:43,458
I had told him to contest from Ajmer.

1960
01:53:44,041 --> 01:53:46,333
I am not used to stepping back.

1961
01:53:47,166 --> 01:53:50,250
My name was announced for Mertha.
I'll contest from there.

1962
01:53:50,791 --> 01:53:53,500
I've announced your name for Mertha.

1963
01:53:53,958 --> 01:53:57,916
But now it is your duty
to get me out of this quagmire.

1964
01:53:58,291 --> 01:53:59,375
Don't worry.

1965
01:54:00,791 --> 01:54:03,916
I know how to treat a wound
before it becomes untreatable.

1966
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:17,791
Catch her, brother. There she is!

1967
01:54:33,166 --> 01:54:34,250
There she is!

1968
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:54,458
Hello?

1969
01:55:54,916 --> 01:55:59,000
'Hello? I am Anokhi.
I think Mukhtiar will kill me.'

1970
01:55:59,375 --> 01:56:02,375
'If anything happens to me release
the CD, give it to the police.'

1971
01:56:02,458 --> 01:56:03,166
'And listen..'

1972
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:05,708
Hello?

1973
01:56:07,208 --> 01:56:07,791
Let go!

1974
01:56:07,916 --> 01:56:11,250
Anokhi? Hello?
- Let go of me!

1975
01:56:19,708 --> 01:56:23,333
Let go! Let go of me!

1976
01:56:26,458 --> 01:56:27,541
Help me!

1977
01:56:27,666 --> 01:56:28,333
Help!

1978
01:56:28,416 --> 01:56:29,791
Help!

1979
01:58:13,958 --> 01:58:17,250
Mukhtiar Singh killed Anokhi Devi.

1980
01:58:17,666 --> 01:58:20,208
Milord, I have started hating myself.

1981
01:58:20,916 --> 01:58:23,958
I got my hands dirty
by getting into this mess.

1982
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:26,875
Good at least you have a realisation.

1983
01:58:27,416 --> 01:58:32,875
Anyway, according to you
Mukhtiar Khan killed Anokhi Devi.

1984
01:58:33,583 --> 01:58:34,375
Yes.

1985
01:58:35,291 --> 01:58:37,375
Your Honour,
I too believe in the same.

1986
01:58:37,583 --> 01:58:42,958
And all the evidences point out
that Mukhtiar Khan killed Anokhi Devi.

1987
01:58:43,291 --> 01:58:48,500
This case becomes baseless
as Mukhtiar Khan is no longer alive.

1988
01:58:48,625 --> 01:58:50,625
Hence I request the court to release..

1989
01:58:50,708 --> 01:58:55,125
..Mr. Dayal and Mr. Dinanath from
the charges of Anokhi Devi's murder.

1990
01:58:56,291 --> 01:58:57,375
That's all, Your Honour.

1991
01:59:01,208 --> 01:59:02,750
The court is adjourned.

1992
01:59:04,708 --> 01:59:06,583
Yes, I am coming with the CD.

1993
01:59:06,666 --> 01:59:11,083
Hello. You seem to be in a hurry,
Mr. Manoj Singh.

1994
01:59:11,583 --> 01:59:12,416
Who are you?

1995
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,666
Sir has sent this letter
and this CD for you.

1996
01:59:14,791 --> 01:59:16,916
Have a look at it
before you go to court.

1997
01:59:17,041 --> 01:59:17,833
Bye.

1998
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:20,375
Who? Listen! Listen!

1999
01:59:52,583 --> 01:59:53,375
No!

2000
01:59:53,458 --> 01:59:54,375
Let me go!

2001
01:59:54,458 --> 01:59:55,500
Papa!

2002
01:59:55,625 --> 01:59:57,375
Save me, papa!

2003
01:59:57,708 --> 01:59:58,708
Papa!

2004
02:00:00,458 --> 02:00:02,791
Save me, papa!

2005
02:00:02,958 --> 02:00:04,708
No!

2006
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,166
No!

2007
02:00:08,416 --> 02:00:10,416
'I am not going to leave you, papa.'

2008
02:00:11,125 --> 02:00:14,041
'Yes, do let me know if
you want me out of your house.'

2009
02:00:35,541 --> 02:00:36,458
Geeta!

2010
02:00:37,291 --> 02:00:38,000
Geeta!

2011
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:02,333
Geeta!

2012
02:01:08,458 --> 02:01:09,208
Geeta..

2013
02:01:36,083 --> 02:01:38,750
You have always wiped
other people's tears.

2014
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:41,541
And today there are
tears in your eyes?

2015
02:01:41,625 --> 02:01:43,000
It is my mistake, dear.

2016
02:01:44,666 --> 02:01:45,958
I am your culprit.

2017
02:01:47,416 --> 02:01:50,208
No, papa. It's nothing.

2018
02:01:53,125 --> 02:01:56,708
Whatever happened
isn't going to break me.

2019
02:01:57,833 --> 02:02:01,666
But if you cry then I will die.

2020
02:02:01,833 --> 02:02:03,791
I will die, papa.

2021
02:02:03,916 --> 02:02:05,458
I will die, papa.

2022
02:02:07,583 --> 02:02:12,375
Don't get into politics.
You are a decent man.

2023
02:02:12,458 --> 02:02:13,750
You have a family.

2024
02:02:15,291 --> 02:02:16,125
Forget all this.

2025
02:02:17,291 --> 02:02:19,041
She was to go and she is gone.

2026
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,833
Now worry about those who are here.

2027
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:24,000
Thank you.

2028
02:02:24,583 --> 02:02:26,458
I shall keep this
advice of yours in mind.

2029
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:29,333
No!

2030
02:02:33,916 --> 02:02:36,458
Where is the CD about which everyone
is talking about in this case?

2031
02:02:36,541 --> 02:02:38,416
Your Honour, I have the CD with me.

2032
02:02:40,041 --> 02:02:41,708
I have not one but two CDs.

2033
02:02:50,166 --> 02:02:53,333
I request the court
to not view it in the open.

2034
02:02:53,416 --> 02:02:55,541
Please view it in your chambers, sir.

2035
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:56,958
Accepted.

2036
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Disgusting.

2037
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:29,666
This is tells the tale of my sorrows.

2038
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:31,041
Do have a look at this as well.

2039
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:41,500
No! Let go! Papa!

2040
02:03:41,583 --> 02:03:43,500
Help me, papa!

2041
02:03:43,583 --> 02:03:44,708
Papa!

2042
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:46,333
No!

2043
02:03:46,458 --> 02:03:48,541
No! Let go of me!

2044
02:03:52,583 --> 02:03:54,291
Very sad. Who is she?

2045
02:03:55,458 --> 02:03:56,583
She is my daughter, Your Honour.

2046
02:03:59,625 --> 02:04:01,875
I got a medal for fulfilling
my responsibility..

2047
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,375
..towards the society,
my country and the law.

2048
02:04:05,458 --> 02:04:07,333
And she got the
punishment for my deeds.

2049
02:04:09,833 --> 02:04:10,625
Read this.

2050
02:04:11,625 --> 02:04:17,208
I was threatened that if I present
Anokhi Devi's CD in the court..

2051
02:04:17,958 --> 02:04:21,208
..then my daughter's CD will
be distributed across the country.

2052
02:04:24,666 --> 02:04:27,916
Being a father I would've
kept quiet but my brave..

2053
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:35,625
..daughter wiped my tears,
gave me courage and encouraged me.

2054
02:04:36,291 --> 02:04:38,416
Your Honour,
my daughter is a naïve girl.

2055
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:42,458
You are a mature person.
You too have daughters.

2056
02:04:43,375 --> 02:04:45,458
You have not one but three daughters.

2057
02:04:47,166 --> 02:04:49,458
This time you have to be brave.

2058
02:04:49,833 --> 02:04:54,500
This time take the decision
from your heart and not your mind.

2059
02:05:06,125 --> 02:05:08,083
I have watched both the CDs.

2060
02:05:08,625 --> 02:05:11,708
I am feeling repentant
and embarrassed.

2061
02:05:12,125 --> 02:05:18,125
But I cannot make a judgement
only on the bases of the CD.

2062
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:23,250
Keeping in mind the arguments
presented by both the..

2063
02:05:24,291 --> 02:05:28,208
..sides and the evidences, it proves
that Mukhtiar killed Anokhi Devi.

2064
02:05:28,291 --> 02:05:31,666
And that Dayal and Dinanath
aren't a part of this murder.

2065
02:05:32,125 --> 02:05:35,625
Hence Dayal and Dinanath
are granted bail.

2066
02:06:04,541 --> 02:06:07,291
You had made arrangements to trap me.

2067
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:09,083
Thank God the judge was my friend.

2068
02:06:09,583 --> 02:06:11,541
Otherwise you had tried your best.

2069
02:06:11,791 --> 02:06:15,791
Dinanath,
even if I get beheaded for you..

2070
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:18,708
..you will say that it is
not beheaded in the right manner.

2071
02:06:19,125 --> 02:06:21,166
In the right manner!

2072
02:06:21,291 --> 02:06:27,375
The damaged you have caused due to
Anokhi Devi will be hard to rectify.

2073
02:06:29,291 --> 02:06:32,958
I'd still say that you should announce
my name for C.M.'s post for our party.

2074
02:06:35,333 --> 02:06:36,416
I will rectify everything.

2075
02:06:37,166 --> 02:06:38,958
I don't have a greed to be the C.M.

2076
02:06:39,041 --> 02:06:40,500
Neither was I greedy for
it before nor am I greedy now.

2077
02:06:41,958 --> 02:06:44,416
When everything is fine,
ask me to resign and I will.

2078
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:45,500
Then you can be the C.M.

2079
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,375
If you want to trap me and get to
the C.M.'s post then forget about it.

2080
02:06:52,166 --> 02:06:54,208
You have been a partner
to all my crimes..

2081
02:06:54,916 --> 02:06:57,958
From Anokhi Devi to
Manoj Singh's daughter..

2082
02:06:58,583 --> 02:06:59,375
You..

2083
02:07:06,541 --> 02:07:08,125
Long live..
- Manoj Singh!

2084
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:09,916
Long live..
- Manoj Singh!

2085
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,583
Long live..
- Manoj Singh!

2086
02:07:11,666 --> 02:07:13,291
Long live..
- Manoj Singh!

2087
02:07:13,375 --> 02:07:15,166
Long live..
- Manoj Singh!

2088
02:07:15,291 --> 02:07:18,833
Manoj Singh!
- You are eternal!

2089
02:07:18,958 --> 02:07:22,416
Manoj Singh!
- You are eternal!

2090
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:23,291
Move back!

2091
02:07:23,375 --> 02:07:24,541
Long live..
- Manoj Singh!

2092
02:07:24,666 --> 02:07:26,500
Long live..
- Manoj Singh!

2093
02:07:26,583 --> 02:07:28,583
"Truth alone prevails." - Long live..
- Manoj Singh!

2094
02:07:30,208 --> 02:07:31,083
Long live..
- Manoj Singh!

2095
02:07:31,166 --> 02:07:32,958
Long live..
- Manoj Singh!

2096
02:07:33,458 --> 02:07:37,750
Your Honour,
you must be surprised to see me here.

2097
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,083
I have always trusted
the law and our system.

2098
02:07:45,583 --> 02:07:48,750
The two criminals who
were supposed to imprisoned..

2099
02:07:49,291 --> 02:07:52,541
..who were supposed to be
punished were given bail by you.

2100
02:07:54,416 --> 02:07:56,416
I killed both of them.

2101
02:07:58,833 --> 02:08:01,000
Your Honour,
I have just killed two people.

2102
02:08:01,833 --> 02:08:04,333
If this incident would've
taken place with your daughter..

2103
02:08:04,416 --> 02:08:06,916
..you would've perhaps killed 200.

2104
02:08:09,333 --> 02:08:11,000
You can give me any
punishment you want.

2105
02:08:11,125 --> 02:08:11,958
I am ready to accept it.

2106
02:08:18,083 --> 02:08:20,791
It is true that
everybody makes mistakes.

2107
02:08:21,583 --> 02:08:26,541
But you cannot atone for
your mistakes, you must be punished.

2108
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,750
Hence I resign from my
post with immediate effect.

2109
02:08:31,291 --> 02:08:32,583
I hereby resign.

2110
02:08:38,458 --> 02:08:43,416
"Truth alone prevails."

2111
02:08:46,458 --> 02:08:50,625
"A knife was used somewhere."

2112
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:54,666
"A bullet was shot somewhere."

2113
02:08:55,375 --> 02:09:01,666
"A group of spoilt
brats are going somewhere."

2114
02:09:03,416 --> 02:09:05,583
"A knife was used somewhere."

2115
02:09:05,708 --> 02:09:08,208
"A bullet was shot somewhere."

2116
02:09:08,291 --> 02:09:12,416
"A group of spoilt
brats are going somewhere."

2117
02:09:13,125 --> 02:09:17,333
"What do I say,
how I saved my life!"

2118
02:09:17,416 --> 02:09:20,791
"What do I say,
how I saved my life!"

2119
02:09:20,958 --> 02:09:22,708
"How I saved my life!"

2120
02:09:22,791 --> 02:09:25,041
"How I saved my life!"

2121
02:09:25,166 --> 02:09:27,166
"My skirt.."

2122
02:09:27,291 --> 02:09:29,375
"My skirt.."

2123
02:09:29,458 --> 02:09:33,750
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

2124
02:09:33,916 --> 02:09:38,041
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

2125
02:09:38,166 --> 02:09:42,333
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

2126
02:09:42,416 --> 02:09:47,166
"Everyone seems to
be chasing my skirt."

2127
02:09:47,291 --> 02:09:49,083
"Yes!"
