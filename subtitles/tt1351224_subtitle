1
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,082
Ya! That's me. Abhay Sharma.

2
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,457
The most important
part of this college,

3
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,874
and as you can see, everyone
here knows just how important l am.

4
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,582
Actually, l'm the
life of this college.

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,915
Because without me, these people
won't even make it through one day,

6
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,415
'cause l make it all happen.. yeah!

7
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,582
Hey, Abhay!

8
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,749
Your homework.

9
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,499
Oh! Thanks man! You
really make it all happen..

10
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,415
What would l do without you?

11
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,082
lt's OK, Bill.

12
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,457
Ya! So, that was my introduction.
Abhay Sharma.

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,249
Ya, ya, l know what you all
must be thinking about me..

14
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:54,165
that l don't look so cool.
But these things don't matter.

15
00:02:55,375 --> 00:03:03,457
Why? Because the most beautiful girl
in college is my girlfriend, Alisha.

16
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,957
OK! OK! Fine. The last
part was a bit of a lie.

17
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,374
Actually, she doesn't
even know who l am..

18
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,749
if l even exist or not.. you know..

19
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:53,124
Bill, l will give you that
history homework tomorrow, OK?

20
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:09,832
Ya! So this was me. Abhay Sharma. And
that was Alisha, the love of my life.

21
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,707
She doesn't know this yet,
but someday she will.

22
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,165
Everything will be just fine.

23
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,540
Don't you worry! What?
You don't believe me?

24
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,999
Would l ever lie to you guys?

25
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:29,207
OK, OK, OK.. l know l just lied
but you know what they say, right..

26
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,624
that everything's
fair in love and war,

27
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,290
and however impossible it may seem..
this is definitely love.

28
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,040
Aah, boy.

29
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,165
Hey, boy! You, the
hunk with the trunk.

30
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,749
Packin' in a fully loaded funky junk.

31
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,040
Hey, boy! With the brandy snap eyes.

32
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,999
He tell me sinful beautiful lies

33
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,874
l've been looking for a boy

34
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,999
Who can change my day to night

35
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,999
l've been looking for a boy

36
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,915
Who only talks about me

37
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,124
Some boy like this

38
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,290
Some boy like that

39
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,082
No one boy will have it all 'cause..

40
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,957
Oh baby, the truth is

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,124
l'm way out of your league

42
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,457
Alisha

43
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,957
From the moment l saw you

44
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,332
My heart did not listen

45
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,957
But the truth is

46
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,082
You're way out of my league

47
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,374
Alisha

48
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,957
From the moment l saw you

49
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,457
My heart did not listen

50
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,957
But the truth is

51
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,749
You're way out of my league

52
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:56,415
Love is impossible,
impossible.. impossible is love

53
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,957
Hey boy! Me an easy girl to please

54
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,582
Just wanna Mr. right from you honneyz

55
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,957
Hey boy! Me an easy girl to please

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,707
Just wanna Mr. right from you honneyz

57
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:16,707
ln my dreams l can see my guy

58
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:21,957
And when l see him he seems unreal

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,749
His every gesture better than mine

60
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:31,790
My heart feels he just might be real

61
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,999
Some boy like this

62
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,165
Some boy like that

63
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,874
No one boy will have it all 'cause..

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,957
Oh baby, the truth is

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,999
l'm way out of your league

66
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,290
Alisha

67
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,874
From the moment l saw you

68
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,249
My heart did not listen

69
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,832
But the truth is

70
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,999
You're way out of my league

71
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,415
Alisha

72
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,957
From the moment l saw you

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,290
My heart did not listen

74
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,957
But the truth is

75
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,082
You're way out of my league

76
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:22,332
Love is impossible,
impossible.. impossible is love

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,999


78
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,957
Hey boy! Get me drippin' with ice

79
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,624
Get down on your
knees and say what's nice

80
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,957
Hey boy! Get me drippin' with ice

81
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,832
Get down on your
knees and say what's nice

82
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:02,749
l had read about him sometime

83
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:07,457
That he'll be waiting for me somewhere

84
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:12,790
He'll be my beloved
just like l'll be his

85
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,874
And his heaven will be at my feet

86
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,082
Some boy like this

87
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,249
Some boy like that

88
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,957
No one boy will have it all 'cause..

89
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,957
Oh baby, the truth is

90
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,124
l'm way out of your league

91
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,374
Alisha

92
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,957
From the moment l saw you

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,207
My heart did not listen

94
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,957
But the truth is

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,124
You're way out of my league

96
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,415
Alisha

97
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,957
From the moment l saw you

98
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,457
My heart did not listen

99
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,957
But the truth is

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,207
You're way out of my league

101
00:08:52,416 --> 00:09:07,582
Love is impossible,
impossible.. impossible is love

102
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,957
Alisha

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,957
From the moment l saw you

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,582
My heart did not listen

105
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,749
But the truth is

106
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,957
You're way out of my league

107
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,207
Alisha..

108
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,832
And as it often happens in love,

109
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,874
a time comes when the boy and
girl meet for the very first time.

110
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,457
Tonight was that night.

111
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,665
l was so good at it.
Oh, get off me, Natasha.

112
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,707
They say boys will never understand
what goes through a girl's mind..

113
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,790
Stop it! Don't be such a party pooper!

114
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,582
l guess this was something like that.

115
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,665
You know you want me to do it!

116
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,957
No! No!
- OK, you know you want me to do it!

117
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,582
Stop! Stop being a mummy!

118
00:09:58,708 --> 00:09:59,832
Alisha! Stop this!

119
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,999
Oh God! lt sucks!

120
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,082
Uh oh..

121
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,499
lt's very late.
Let's go Alisha, c'mon.

122
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,124
OK, OK.. do not panic,
OK.. l can do this.

123
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,707
Alisha! Oh my God.. Alisha come down..

124
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,040
Alisha, you're making me nervous,
just come down!

125
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,665
Babe.. it's just freaking tequila
we've done this a hundred times before!

126
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:19,999
Alisha! Come down!

127
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,582
OK, OK, watch, OK watch..

128
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,874
l can do this on my toes!
- Alisha.. l can do this on my toes!

129
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,124
Alisha come down! Alisha!

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,249
Alisha!

131
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,999
Oh my God! Alisha!

132
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,957
Alisha! Alisha!

133
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:47,999
Alisha!

134
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,499
She cannot swim..

135
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,957
Alisha!

136
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,874
Help, someone help!

137
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,832
Looks like l'll have to
give her mouth to mouth..

138
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,707
ls she OK?

139
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,957
Thank you so much! But we'll
take it from here, OK?.. thank you.

140
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,082
Hey, what went wrong?

141
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,165
This was not how it
was supposed to be,

142
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,707
by now she should've
fallen in love with me.

143
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,540
l mean, l saved her life, right?

144
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:45,332
l can't understand it.
Ya! l know when!

145
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,374
Tomorrow morning.. of course..
l'm so stupid, right!

146
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,124
ln matters of the
heart l'm sort of new.

147
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,290
Enough is enough

148
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:13,290
l'm fed up Alisha! l don't care
what stage your semester is in.

149
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,665
l'm taking you away from
here and that's final.

150
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,874
Dad! My entire life is here.
How can you even suggest that?

151
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,832
l don't care! This is the
fifth time l've been called here.

152
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,582
l can't take it any more.

153
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,832
l am not going anywhere!

154
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,582
l'm not asking you. l'm
telling you, understand?

155
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,082
So what will you do? Take
me from here forcefully?

156
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,457
l wanna see you try!
- l'm taking you away right now!

157
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,957
l've spoken to the Dean and as
of today you've been rusticated..

158
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,457
.. from this university, understand?

159
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,290
That is so unfair.

160
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,457
Pack your bags.

161
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,415
Dad, please.. my semester!

162
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,499
l'm waiting outside.
- Dad, please!

163
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,957
Look, thanks for
whatever you did last night.

164
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:07,124
But l think you should go now. She
needs to be alone. Thanks anyway.

165
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,249
Don't worry. l'll speak to your dad.
Everything's gonna be alright.

166
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,957
He's not gonna listen. What makes
you think he's gonna listen to you..

167
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,332
he's just stubborn..
who were you speaking to?

168
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,624
Nobody.. just that geek who
saved your life last night.

169
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,499
l should say thank you, right?

170
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,290
Ya.. but that's not
important right now.

171
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,999
l guess..

172
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:49,582
The truth is that not every love
story can have a happy ending, right?

173
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,457
And when something like this
happens then people like..

174
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,082
.. us need to forget
about our love and move on.

175
00:14:56,208 --> 00:15:00,290
She still doesn't even
know who l am.. and it's OK.

176
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,290
Now, l just need to get her
out of my heart.. that's all.

177
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:11,249
Alisha, l guess this love
was impossible after all.

178
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:18,999
But l wish you happiness
wherever you go. Goodbye, Alisha.

179
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,332
Good morning, Abhay Sharma!

180
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,874
This is your wake up call for the day.

181
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,624
l have the following
facts for you this morning.

182
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,957
Did you know that the white part of
your fingernail is called the lunula?

183
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,040
Did you know that when a
coffee seed is planted

184
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,082
it takes five years to
yield consumable fruit?

185
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,957
Did you know that the
largest prime number is 1 3, 395

186
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,540
digits long more than the number of..

187
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,832
Morning.

188
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,290
Morning, Dad.

189
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,957
Dad, l have a very
important meeting today.

190
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,207
Meeting? What meeting?

191
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:29,207
There's an investor who is
interested in my software.

192
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,665
l'm giving him a presentation today.

193
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,915
That's great! But you
should have come to me first.

194
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,457
l have lots of friends
in the software industry.

195
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,707
l could have set up a meeting
with any one of them for you.

196
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:47,915
Dad, you started your business alone.
You did everything solely on your own.

197
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,124
l want to follow in your footsteps.

198
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,124
Like father, like son.

199
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,165
But if you ever need anything
you know that l'm here, right?

200
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:04,957
Of course, Dad. Now eat your cereal.

201
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,415
l'm worried about you,
friend! No, l'm really worried!

202
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,290
You've been in love with
that girl for six years..

203
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,499
What was her name?
- Alisha.

204
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,832
Alisha. lt's been six years!

205
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,124
Not six, Dad, it's been seven years.

206
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,707
Of course! Seven years. Look son..

207
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,207
There's love and
then there's obsession.

208
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,957
You need to forget about this girl.

209
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,082
Anyway, l have to go. And
good luck for your interview!

210
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,332
Abhay?
- Ya. Hi!

211
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,374
Hi! Siddharth Singh.
You can call me Sidhu.

212
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,540
OK.

213
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,040
Some coffee? Ya?
- Ya.

214
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,332
Excuse me, two cappuccinos please!

215
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,582
So, finally we meet.
- Ya.

216
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,832
l've heard a lot about your software.

217
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,624
l.. l hope you like it.

218
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,707
l'm sure l will. So shall we begin?

219
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,249
OK, let's start. So this
software is essentially an

220
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,207
operating system
that l've named Unity.

221
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,124
Now, you'll be thinking, why Unity?

222
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,290
Well, Unity because this operating
system has the ability to unify each..

223
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,457
.. and every kind of
operating system across the world.

224
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:25,582
l mean, you can use programs running
on any operating system on Unity.

225
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,832
lt could be Windows, the
Mac OS or even Linux systems.

226
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,499
Moreover, you can even use
it on your mobile phone.

227
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,749
So, from mobile phones to computers,
it works on everything.

228
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,749
So this is Unity, my work
over the last seven years.

229
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,957
Fantastic! Abhay, l'm impressed.

230
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,124
Thanks.

231
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:49,082
l'm very impressed. ln fact,
this has exceeded my expectations.

232
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,415
Just one thing Abhay.
- Ya?

233
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,915
Before investing in this,

234
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,832
l'll need the original
program files of this software.

235
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,249
Program files? OK..

236
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,040
Yes, l'll need them.

237
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,249
Can you just excuse me, please?

238
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,332
Hello, Dad?

239
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,540
Hi, Abhay, how are you?
How are things?

240
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:21,415
Dad, he's quite impressed but he's
asking for the original program files.

241
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,374
He's saying that he wants them
before he invests in the software.

242
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,332
No, no, no. Don't give him
anything until the deal is finalised.

243
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,332
Tell him that after the deal is done
you will give the files to him, OK?

244
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,582
Nothing before that.
Don't make that mistake. OK?

245
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,707
OK, OK, Dad. Thanks. Bye.

246
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,290
Should we go ahead?

247
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,957
Uh, actually Sidhu, sir..

248
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,749
l won't be able to give you the actual
program files until the deal is done.

249
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,499
But l have a CD that
contains the executable files.

250
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,957
You can learn everything about the
software through it. This you can take.

251
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:07,915
Look, Abhay. Don't get me wrong.
Your Unity software is fantastic.

252
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:12,540
But on giving it some
thought l feel that this is not

253
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,957
what we're looking for right now.

254
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,332
But.. but l assure you, sir!
This is a path breaking software.

255
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,082
No, it's fantastic but just
not right for us right now.

256
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,957
But all the best and
thank you very much.

257
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,957
Sir, it's taken me seven
years to develop this software..

258
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,957
.. and l've personally tested it in
every possible hardware configuration.

259
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,749
So if you're thinking compatibility,

260
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,790
it's compatible with
all the hardware systems.

261
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:46,124
lf you're thinking speed, l've
tested it in all the benchmark tests..

262
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,999
.. and if you're
thinking usability then

263
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,665
this is so easy that
even a child can use it.

264
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,207
So, as you can see,

265
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,499
this is going to be a revolutionary
new software called Unity.

266
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,207
What's the name of the company?
- Pinnacle.

267
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,582
very good presentation, Mr.
Sharma. very good.

268
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:05,957
But we've heard that there
is a Singapore-based company..

269
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:11,249
.. that is going to launch a similar
software, and it's called.. Unify?

270
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:17,874
Unify? But, but sir, l developed this
software, it's absolutely original.

271
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,957
lt's not possible that
someone could develop..

272
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,290
a software exactly like this one,
it's just not possible, sir.

273
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,790
l hear what you're saying, Mr. Sharma.

274
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,290
But our company
wouldn't want to get involved

275
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,999
in anything that harms our reputation.

276
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,582
l hope you understand.

277
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:35,624
Anyway, thank you very much, Mr.
Sharma, l wish you all the best.

278
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,499
Excuse me, could you tell me the
name of that Singapore company.. ?

279
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,290
Ya, sure.. Pinnacle Software.

280
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,290
.. Pinnacle Software.

281
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,957
Can you just excuse me please?
- Sure.

282
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:50,082
So, what you're saying is that
you have made this software.

283
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,124
Dad, l've been working on
this for the last seven years.

284
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:56,999
OK, and now someone
has stolen it from you?

285
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,207
Ya.

286
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:04,165
You know, Abhay, l'm to
blame for making you like this.

287
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,707
Like what?

288
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,415
Like me. Running away
from unpleasantness,

289
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:14,957
not fighting for your rights,
but there's a reason behind this.

290
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,665
After your mother passed away
l just wanted to protect you

291
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,999
from the rest of the world, and
in the process l made you weak.

292
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,165
That's not true.

293
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,957
That's true. Now if you want
to forget about this software..

294
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:33,874
.. and stay here with me, l'll still
love you as much as l do right now.

295
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:37,749
l'll still be proud of you.
But if you go to Singapore and

296
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:42,957
get your software back from that man
then you will be proud of yourself.

297
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,165
lt's your decision,
what do you want to do?

298
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,707
You know,.. ,l have the
best dad in the world.

299
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:57,999
l know that.

300
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,499
And l'm going to Singapore.

301
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,332
Taxi!

302
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,874
l'm sorry sir, but there's no
one with the name Siddharth Singh..

303
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,332
.. working in any
department of this company.

304
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,290
Dad, l'm sitting
outside the Pinnacle office.

305
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,582
There's no one named
Siddharth Singh here.

306
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,665
l'm at a loss, Dad. What should l do?

307
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:02,165
Son, don't lose hope and
remember one thing - that you have..

308
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,207
.. to get your software
back no matter what, OK?

309
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,457
Believe in yourself,
everything will be alright.

310
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:12,457
And what if l don't find him?
l don't think he's here at all.

311
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,915
l don't know what to do.

312
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:19,540
lf this company releases my software
then what can l do about it, Dad?

313
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,999
Please help me, l don't
know what to do, l just..

314
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,040
just don't know what to do any more.

315
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:28,082
Relax, relax Abhay.. just relax.

316
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:33,582
OK, do one thing. Close your
eyes and take a deep breath.

317
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,582
Now imagine good things around you.

318
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:47,207
lmagine that there are new,
beautiful computers around you.

319
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,165
And Alisha..

320
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:56,832
Of course, of course, Alisha..
her too, ya?

321
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,582
Feeling good, right son?

322
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:04,957
Ya, Dad.

323
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:07,749
Now open your eyes.

324
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,957
Feeling good?

325
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:27,957
l feel great, Dad, just great.
l can see her, like..

326
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,165
like she's right in front of me.
She's just so beautiful.

327
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,290
Who?

328
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,957
Alisha, Dad! Who else?

329
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:42,957
Son, l told you to open your eyes!

330
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,707
Dad, my eyes are open but
she's still in front of me!

331
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:53,999
OK, fine, no problem.
Actually, this is even better,

332
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:58,290
You keep dreaming about her! So
what is Alisha doing right now?

333
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:06,249
Dad, she's gone inside
the Pinnacle office.

334
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,290
That's a good thing! lt's a good sign.

335
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,832
So, why don't you
follow her into the office

336
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,290
And fight for what's rightfully yours?

337
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,665
Get your software back,

338
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,040
it's not me but Alisha who
is showing you the path.

339
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,957
You're right Dad, l'm going.

340
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,415
OK, good. l'm going too,
to the bathroom!

341
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,332
Look, l'm not going to
take no for an answer.

342
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,124
l need to see someone right now.

343
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:31,040
But - No ifs or buts! l
want to see someone, now!

344
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:34,374
OK, OK, sir, just calm down.
Let me see what l can do.

345
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:39,665
Hi! There's someone who wants
to meet the head of PR urgently.

346
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,999
ls that alright? OK, thank you.

347
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,540
Sir, you can go to the fourth floor..

348
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,332
..and meet our public
relations officer in charge.

349
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:49,415
lt's the first room on the left.

350
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,790
OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.

351
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,874
Sorry.

352
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,415
lt's alright.

353
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,165
C'mon now. You guys
can't even do this much?

354
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,832
l have to do everything myself?

355
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:36,999
Oh, my God!

356
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,499
Even l was remembering God, Dad!

357
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:43,249
Look, you've been in love with
this girl for the last six years..

358
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,415
Seven years, Dad.

359
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,249
OK, don't correct me.
Seven years? OK, fine.

360
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,540
Don't you think you should
speak to her now at least?

361
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,040
What's the worst that could happen?

362
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:57,957
She won't recognise you, or
she might give you a slap or two!

363
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,999
But at least you'll have a
clear picture about your situation.

364
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,499
You're absolutely right, Dad.

365
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,874
Basically, you're not
going to speak to this girl..

366
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:11,374
No, Dad.

367
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:14,957
Congratulations!

368
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:16,832
Thank you.

369
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,457
Taxi! Taxi!

370
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:29,374
Thank you.

371
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:01,374
Tania, stop troubling me! Tania, l
can't deal with this, are you mad?

372
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,415
Tania! Tania! Stop it,
Tania, have you lost your mind?

373
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,749
Tania, behave yourself,

374
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:07,957
l'm not going to deal with
your nonsense, Tania, l swear!

375
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,957
Just stop it, Tania!
You're driving me mad..

376
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,582
..Tania, l can't deal
with your nonsense any more!

377
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:13,957
Thank God! You're here.

378
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,707
Look, l can't do this any more,
she's not a child, she's a monster!

379
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,332
Forgive me, but l'm leaving. l quit!

380
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:20,957
No, no, no, no Mansi,
you can't go anywhere.

381
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,415
Look, please, l need
to get back to office

382
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,082
and there's no one
here to look after Tania.

383
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,915
Please, please. OK, just try
and understand, l'm a single,

384
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,415
divorced working mother and l don't
have anyone else! - l don't care!

385
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,082
OK, OK, fine, l'll
pay you double, double!

386
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,082
l don't care!
- Triple! But not more than that.

387
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:37,832
l'm sorry Alisha, but l love
my own life more than money.

388
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:40,415
Now you handle this monster of yours,
l'm out of here.. bye!

389
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,957
Mons.. ! Tania Merchant!

390
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,332
Mom! You're home, yay!

391
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,457
Oh no you don't, don't try cute on me.

392
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,582
lt's not gonna work.
l'm very upset with you.

393
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,415
How will l go back to the office now?

394
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,165
So don't go to the office, Mom.
We'll spend the entire day together.

395
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,165
Why do you trouble me so much, T?

396
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,082
Cause l love you, Mom!

397
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:23,249
l love you too, munchkin,
but you know Mom is working.

398
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:26,624
And however much l want to, l
can't spend the entire day with you.

399
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:33,374
Now, we'll have to find
somebody to look after you. Who?

400
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,332
Hello.. Jasmeet and
Jasmeet Nanny Agency..

401
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,832
an exclusive agency of lndian Nannies.

402
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,332
Our Nannies are
extremely intelligent..

403
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:47,332
Jasmeet! This is Alisha..
Alisha Merchant.

404
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:52,082
Alisha! Alisha! You talk to her.

405
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:54,665
Not me! Not me! l won't speak to her.
- Again..

406
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,999
Oh no!.. speaker.
Ya, hello Alisha dear.

407
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,957
So, tell me, how can l
be of assistance to you?

408
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,249
Jasmeet, you know what?

409
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,499
That nanny you sent me
had so much attitude!

410
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:14,082
l've fired her, and now my problem is
that l need to get back to the office.

411
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:16,249
And l urgently need another nanny.

412
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,582
Again?

413
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,207
You know how it is..

414
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:22,165
l know how it is,
Alisha. l know how it is.

415
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,957
Actually, the thing is, that this
is the fifth nanny that has quit

416
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,957
working at your house in
the last three months.

417
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,165
l don't think anyone will be
willing to work at your place.

418
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,332
And don't feel bad.
You see, your daughter,

419
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:36,415
Tania, she's a bit of
a challenge, you see.

420
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:37,957
l don't think anyone will come to work

421
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,499
for you because
everyone is scared of her.

422
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:44,040
C'mon, Jasmeet, she's just six! So
what's the big deal? OK, fine, fine.

423
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,957
Please help me out this time, l
need to get back to the office

424
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,665
and l'm really, really late.
Just this one time.

425
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,874
Hello, look this is very short notice.

426
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,749
lf someone can come then
she'll come to work for you.

427
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:58,957
But l'm not making any promises.

428
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,582
And if she does come then she'll
reach your place by twelve o' clock.

429
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,665
That's fine. l'll wait for her, OK.

430
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,832
But this is the last
time we are doing this,

431
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,832
we can't send any more
nannies after this time.

432
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:08,374
l owe you one, Jasmeet!

433
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,665
OK, Alisha dear, take
care then, thank you.

434
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:12,665
Again..

435
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,957
Jasmeet, l don't think anyone
will be willing to go to her house.

436
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,874
So what should we do then, Jasmeet ?

437
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,957
l have an idea!
- What?

438
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,874
Let's not do anything. Let's
not send anyone to her house!

439
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:28,665
Let's not send anyone.
She'll understand then.

440
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,957
This seems like a good plan.
- lt's a good idea, right?

441
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,332
Ya!
- So it's done then!

442
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:34,415
Cheers!
- Cheers dear, cheers! To you too.

443
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:41,124
Hi! Hi! Hi!

444
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,124

445
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,749
No, no.. just keep it simple.. ya.

446
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,665
Hi! My name is Abhay Sharma.

447
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:57,957
Hi! My name is Tony. Nice to meet you.

448
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,499
Yes. l know that and l will be.

449
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,165
l'm just waiting for a new nanny

450
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,165
and as soon as she gets
here l will leave, l promise.

451
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:16,707
Yes, absolutely. Tania, you better
not be throwing away your broccoli.

452
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:26,040
And no, this time that
smile won't work, so eat it.

453
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,999
She's here and on time, fab!
God bless Jasmeet!

454
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:44,374
l've been waiting for you for
so long and now you're here..

455
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:55,374
But you're a man..

456
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:01,957
Ya, sorry, l'll..

457
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:04,249
No, no, no, nobody's perfect.

458
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,832
l'll introduce you to Tania,

459
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,040
you're gonna love her,
she's.. you will love her.

460
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,040
Tania! Look, normally l don't keep
anyone without interviewing them

461
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,165
but the Jasmeets have sent you
and l totally trust them and l'm..

462
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,707
oh my God, l'm so late.

463
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,165
So today we'll try you

464
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,957
Tania! And please finish
whatever chores there are on the list

465
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,999

work needs to get done. Tania!

466
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:27,457
l'm eating!
- l don't care! Now!

467
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:28,999
Look, l think that..

468
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,665
Ya Mom, what is it?

469
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:37,832
Tania, your new nanny. Hi?
- Nanny?

470
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,832
Ewww! But he's a man.

471
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:45,415
Really? Thank you, Tania,
because if you hadn't told me then

472
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,207
how would l ever know that he's a man?

473
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,165
Come here, you be a good girl, OK?

474
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,582

475
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:55,749
OK, bye!

476
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,165
Bye! Please clean the
house before l get home.

477
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,749
Actually l'm a computer software..

478
00:37:58,833 --> 00:37:59,957
Don't you dare touch the computer!

479
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,165
Don't touch it. l
have just understood it.

480
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,040
l have just managed to figure it out,

481
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:07,415
oh and l'll check your work when l
get back. So just.. just know that.

482
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,374
Excuse me.. - CP, ya l've just left.
5 minutes. One second, hold on, ya?

483
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,707
lf anything, anything at all
happens to my daughter l'll chop you up

484
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,957
into tiny little pieces and feed you
to the animals in the Singapore zoo!

485
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:25,874
And have a nice day! Ya? OK. Yes, CP..

486
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:29,749
l'll sort it out as soon
as l get to the office.

487
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,499
Hi! My name is Abhay Sharma.

488
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,290
l hate you!

489
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,499
Look, l don't know anything
about this nanny business.

490
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:00,207
But l can't even leave
you home alone, right?

491
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:04,415
So let's do one thing,
let's become friends.

492
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:12,124
OW! Tania!

493
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:20,165
Now get out of the house or
else l'll call the police!

494
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,207
Police? But what have l done?

495
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:31,707
Nothing. But if l tell them that
you were doing bad things with me,

496
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:36,999
then who do you think they
will believe? You or me?

497
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,165
Look, let's make a deal.

498
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,457
Let me stay here till your
mother gets back and in exchange

499
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:46,874
l'm ready to do anything for you.
l'll do anything. Anything.

500
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,790
Anything?

501
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,582
Number 1 ! Clean the house!

502
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,957
Hey! You missed a spot.

503
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:25,415
Tania's homework!

504
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,665
Yes!

505
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,957
Back to work.

506
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:46,165
Piano lessons. Ewww! Yuck! Boring!

508
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,582
Because l'm going to be a rock star,

509
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:59,915
and rock stars don't play the piano..
they play the guitar!

510
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,832
Oh, OK.

My name is Froggy Four Eyes.

530
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:17,040
And l'm a stupid fool.

531
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:19,415
l am a slave to Tania.

532
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,749
l'm a slave to Tania.

533
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,957
Cause she's very cool!

534
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,624
Cause she's very cool..

535
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,540
Tania?

536
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,624
Hi mommy!

537
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,290
Hi!

538
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:48,582
Oh my.. oh my God! l am..
l am so sorry about this.

539
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,582
Never mind.. it's,
it's OK.. it's fine.

540
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:53,374
No, no, no, it's absolutely not OK.

541
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:57,582
Tania Merchant this is,
this is just not done.

542
00:42:57,666 --> 00:42:59,582
You can't treat people like this.

543
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:04,040
l mean, look at this poor man,
what have you done to him?

544
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,999
You think it's funny?
You think it's funny?

545
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,165
Because it's really not,
Tania Merchant,

546
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,165
it's his niceness that
he's stayed here for so long.

547
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,624
Anyone else would have left
you alone and gone long ago.

548
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:20,749
l'm really, really sorry,
and thank you so much for..

549
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:26,499
l know that Tania must have
troubled you a lot and l can see it.

550
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,957
But you see, l really
need a nanny like you.

551
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,957
And it's OK that you're
a man, it's totally fine.

552
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:37,332
Do you think that you could
forgive Tania and take this job?

553
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,082
But Mom!

554
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,957
The thing is that l need
to tell you something..

555
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,249
Ya, ya, sure! Totally!

556
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:48,040
Say whatever you need to
say but please take this job.

557
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:51,832
You know. Just come
with me one second. - Ya.

558
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:57,082
You see, no one has been able
to handle Tania like this and

559
00:43:57,166 --> 00:44:02,749
l'm a divorced single
working mother. lt's difficult.

560
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:06,540
l'm ready to give you anything, l'll
double your salary, how about that?

561
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:08,415
No, you don't understand
what l'm trying to say.

562
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,165
l've come to tell you
something really important.

563
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:14,499
OK fine! Triple. But
that's it OK.. please.

564
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:17,082
l need to tell you something really..

565
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:23,082
Look. l really need you to do this.

566
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,957
Please say yes, just please say yes.

567
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:33,332
Please. Try it but say yes.

568
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:36,957
Yes.

569
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,874
OK.. l.. sweet!

570
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:49,124
Great, so since everything is settled,

571
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,957
come tomorrow morning at seven

572
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:55,749
and you can leave after
finishing all the housework.

573
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:58,207
Just be back at three o' clock,
Tania comes back from school by then.

574
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,082
OK..
- OK.

575
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:02,999
What was your name again?

576
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:05,707
Uh.. Abhay Sharma.

577
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:11,249
Abhay Sharma. Hi! Alisha Merchant.
Nice to meet you.

578
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:13,124
You too.

579
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:17,957
l'm really sorry about
all that, really sorry.

580
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,499
lt's, it's OK. G'night.

581
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:23,499
G'night
- G'night Tania.

582
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,790
lt's.. it's OK.

583
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:34,290
You know how it is. OK,
bye! l'll see you tomorrow.

584
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:50,415
What? You've become a maid?

585
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,999
Not a maid, Dad,
they're called nannies here.

586
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,915
And you're the one who
told me to go speak to her,

587
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:58,957
so l went to speak to her and
she employed me as her nanny.

588
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,332
Now what?

589
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,665
Now nothing, Dad. l'll
have to clean the house,

590
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,415
cook food, and take
care of her daughter.

591
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,499
Ya! l almost forgot to tell you.

592
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:11,457
Alisha is a single, divorced mother
who lives here with her daughter.

593
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:15,665
Daughter?

594
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,415
Ya, Dad! A six-year-old monster
who is intent on ruining my life.

595
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,040
So wish me luck, Dad.. for my new job.

596
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:26,082
But.. but son.. she
is a single mother,

597
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:30,707
she has a six-year-old
daughter and you still..

598
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,624
l know what you're thinking, Dad.

599
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,457
But all this doesn't
make a difference to me.

600
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:45,040
For me Alisha will always be Alisha.
Anyway, l gotta go, Bye! Taxi!

601
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:49,624
Hold my bag..

602
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,957
That's it. Stop. Stop. Stop.

603
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,749
Hey, Abhay. You are a
little late today, no?

604
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:25,124
But that's not important.
Actually, kinda is but anyway..

605
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:27,124
For today, things that you need to do.

606
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:32,082
Number 1 . vacuum and dust the living
room. Number 2. Polish the silver.

607
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,957
Number 3. Remove the clothes from
the washer and put them in the dryer,

608
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,999
and put the clothes lying in
the hamper into the washer.

609
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:41,290
And ya! Don't forget to separate the
coloured clothes otherwise.. anyway.

610
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:44,082
The clothes for ironing
are lying on the table,

611
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:46,415
l'm sure you know how to iron clothes.

612
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:48,457
Ya, right!

613
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,915
l'll talk to you soon. Bye!

614
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:19,957
Nobody answer the phone!

615
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:27,582
Ssshh.. everybody quiet. Thank you.

616
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:29,957
Hello.
- Hey, Abhay!

617
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,624
All OK? You got my note?

618
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,624
Ya, ya, ya! l'll do everything,
not to worry.

619
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:36,874
OK, see you tonight.

620
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,040
Back to work everyone.

621
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:47,165
This is for the full week, ya?
Thank you, thank you..

622
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,124
Perfect!

623
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:01,624
So what would be your
legal advice in this matter?

624
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:06,290
Do you know where Mr.
Siddharth Singh is right now?

625
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,915
Mr. Sharma, l do want to help you.

626
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:24,957
l knew your father really well

627
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,415
but you don't even know
where Mr. Siddharth Singh is.

628
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:32,124
And you have no proof
that he stole your software.

629
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:41,957
My legal advice would be

630
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,165
that you forget about your software,
you have no case.

631
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:00,582
Hello Mr. Sanghvi.

632
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:03,957
l'm Alisha Merchant, welcome
to Pinnacle. lt's our pleasure.

633
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:06,124
The pleasure's all mine Ms. Merchant.

634
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:08,957
And if you greet me so beautifully

635
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,790
then it would be
difficult for me to ever leave.

636
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:15,624
That's what our intention is..

637
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:18,832
Really? l like that.

638
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:23,457
Shall we Mr. Sanghvi?

639
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:25,165
Sure! After you.

640
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,540
This way.

641
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,082
Ms. Merchant. Call me varun.

642
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,665
Sure.. varun.

643
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,207
God l'm late.. Tania. Oh help me!

644
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:48,374
Because l'm going to be a rock star,

645
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:53,790
and rock stars don't play the piano..
they play the guitar!

646
00:50:57,791 --> 00:50:59,624
What is this?
- A bribe.

647
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:01,957
A bribe? For what?

648
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,707
So that you don't hate me.

649
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,624
l see..

650
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,999
So.. friends?

651
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:17,415
We'll see.

652
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:19,915
We'll see?

653
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:24,999
Ya! lt depends whether l
like your bribe or not.

654
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:30,874
Ok, that's fair. So do you
want to open this or should l?

655
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,415
Wow! You got me
Rockband ! l can't believe it!

656
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,874
Mummy promised that she'd get this
for me, only if l did well in my exams.

657
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:46,957
Thank you Mr.
Froggy, you're not so bad.

658
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,582

753
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:20,040
Never really had one either.

00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,665
But l'm totally okay

Ok

766
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,374
Anyway, what about your marriage?

767
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:09,082
Oh.. l'm so sorry, l forgot..
l'm so.. so sorry.

768
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:11,499
No no no, it's ok.

769
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:12,874
l didn't mean to..

770
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,665
No. lt's not a big deal..

771
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:22,707
l was very young when l got married.
l mean l was what?

772
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:28,790
Like.. 1 8. And like
it usually happens,

773
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:33,457
the guy turned out to be a
jerk and we got divorced.

774
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:38,999
After that l didn't want
to stay in lndia any longer,

775
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,040
and anyway it's not like he was
interested in taking care of Tania.

776
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:50,957
So, when l got a job in Singapore,
l took it and we moved here.

777
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:54,665
A new life, a new beginning.

778
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:59,957
Lets talk about
something else ya.. ok.

779
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:01,957

01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:03,790
Oh, it's fine.
- Ya?

781
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:04,999
lt's fine.
- Ok

782
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:06,957
Don't worry about it. Ok

783
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,915
So, what work do you do in Singapore?

784
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:15,582
There is this software company
called Pinnacle Technologies.

785
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:16,749
l'm the PR and marketing..

786
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,124
Hi Mom! Came to say Goodnight.

787
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:21,999
Hey pumpkin.. who's that?

788
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:28,915

789
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:30,999
Hey rock star!
- What's up?

790
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,957
Who's varun?

791
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:34,249
l don't know.

792
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,374
Ok, Goodnight!

793
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,915
Goodnight froggy four eyes!

794
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:44,332
Ya.. so maybe

795
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:46,749
Alisha. Bye. Goodnight.

796
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:52,415
Oh bye, goodnight. Oh, no, no one.

797
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:56,999
That's just Tania's nanny.
Ya, so you were saying.

798
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,374
Hello Dad.

799
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:06,499
Abhay.. is everything alright?

800
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:09,999
No
- What happened? Alisha?

801
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:16,290
Son, the one girl you couldn't forget

802
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,499
for seven years has
come back into your life.

803
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:22,957
Do something so that she
gets to know the real you.

804
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:25,207
And what will that accomplish Dad?

805
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:27,874
Well, anything can happen. Love?

806
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,749
C'mon Dad. This is Alisha remember?

807
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:37,332
She won't even look at guys
like me.. this love is impossible.

808
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:43,957
Son, the ones who win in
life aren't always the stronger,

809
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,957
faster, clever ones.

810
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:51,457
ln the end, the one who wins is
the one who believes in himself.

811
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,915
The question here is, do
you believe in yourself?

812
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:58,665
l don't know Dad..

813
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,207
So then find out.

814
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,374
Because this
impossible love story can only

815
01:02:04,916 --> 01:02:08,499
be made possible by
you and no one else.

816
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:12,790
You're right dad. You're right..

817
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:19,832
let me call you back ya?.. Bye..

818
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:21,165
Good luck.

819
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:27,040
Possible..

820
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,290
Possible.. ya..

821
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:09,874
CP, you do
understand how much of my time

822
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:12,707

developing this software?

823
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:15,915
Of course, varun. l
completely understand.

824
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:21,915
Great! So then, according to you,
how much would it all be worth?

825
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,874
A sum this large has
never been offered

826
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:33,915
to anyone before in the
entire history of this company.

827
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:37,040
Mr. Sanghvi.

828
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,915
CP.. in the company's
history this offer might be large

829
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,040
but according to me it's not.

830
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:58,457
Alright, Mr. Sanghvi. Why
don't you tell us what you expect?

831

01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:07,957
and you have a deal.

833

You play hardball, Mr. Sanghvi.

Please call me varun.

.. but l have full
faith in this software.

837
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:26,957
We can seal this
deal on one condition.

then all your program files,

839

any other related work..

.. has to be handed over to me.

841
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:42,790
And all these files will be put
into this company's secure server.

842
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:48,082
Sure. So do we have a deal then?

843
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:56,790

850
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:17,040
For sure!

851
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:20,040
Great! So then, may l
take you out to dinner?

852
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,790
Well, logically, you are our guest.

853
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:25,624
So l should be the one
taking you out to dinner.

854
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:26,915
l'm okay with that!

855
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,332
l'm sorry to interrupt but
this software has to be put into

856
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:32,665
the company's server right now.
C'mon, let's go. - Right. OK.

857
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,832
Boss is calling.
- Yeah! OK.

858
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:39,540
Come, varun.
- After you.

859
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:41,124
Thank you.
- Thanks.

860
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:44,999
This way.

861
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,415
As you can see, this
facility is completely secure.

862
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:52,665
The internal network is
directly accessed from here,

863
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:55,749
and only senior personnel are
allowed access to this room.

864
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:56,999
That's right.

865
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,999
lt is your destiny, Luke!

866
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:17,540
No way, Jos!
- Jos? Who's Jos? He wasn't a Jedi!

867
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:19,499
Do l look like l care?

868
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:32,207
Look, Mom, l'm a Jedi!

869
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:35,749
Ya! And it looks like a
lot more fun than homework!

870
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:37,040
What homework?

871
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:42,457
Tania! Tania! She's just kidding.

872
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:46,957
Until she finishes her
homework l never let her play. Never.

873
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,207
l'm sure.

874
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:54,915
Abhay, could l have a
word with you? Upstairs.

875
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,915
Why? l mean ya, ya, sure!

876
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:00,999
Now?

877
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:09,207
OK.

878
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:13,165
Hello?

879
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:14,665
Abhay!
- Hi!

880
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:22,915
Hi! Come on in. Actually l just need
some advice. A man's point of view.

881
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,499
Ya, sure.

882
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:29,540
Why don't these things
ever work? l hate them, man!

883
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,707
lf you like, may l?

884
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:34,999
You understand these things?

885
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:37,040
A bit.

886
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:39,749
Shut up! Really? Come. Come. Come.

887
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:45,832
l never get network, it's
like www-wayovermyhead.com.

888
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:48,040
Have a seat.

889
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:55,874
OK, so the problem is
there's this guy in office, varun.

890
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:58,665
And he's asked me out to dinner.

891
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:06,249
That's not the issue, the
problem is l work with him, you know.

892
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,874
And l know l
shouldn't mix my personal..

893
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:13,665
.. and professional life
but l mean technically,

894
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,957
he doesn't even work in my office.
He's just like my client.

895
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:23,499
He's like really cute, you
know how it is? - Ya, ya.

896
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,832
What should l do?

897
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:29,165
l..
- OK, so l have two choices.

898
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:31,999
One, that l go out
with him for dinner.

899
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:37,082
Alone, like a date..
but it's too early.

900
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:42,790
Two, that l invite him home,
but that's just too intimate.

901
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:49,207
Unless l invite some
people from the office as well?

902
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,999
Right!
- Ya!

903
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:54,999
That's great!

904
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:57,874
Because inviting everyone
over for dinner will make sure

905
01:08:57,916 --> 01:08:59,457
the situation remains casual.

906
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:04,082
And it means we are still
meeting for dinner. l like it!

907
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,707
Ya, me too..

908
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:12,165
You're fab. Thank you very much. l
feel so much better now, really!

909
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:13,540
Any time.

910
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:20,290
Thanks! Oh! But listen, hey,
we'll have the dinner tomorrow and..

911
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:22,790
Rohan, Madeleine, CP, Sumitra..

912
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:26,457
.. you'll manage cooking
for six people, right?

913
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,457
Ya.

914
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:33,249
Oh! And l love Thai food. You
know how to cook Thai food, right?

915
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:39,665
Thai food? Ya, ya! Of course!

916
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,624
Really?
- Ya.

917
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:47,499
That is so cool. You can
do just about everything!

918
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:49,290
Ya!

919
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:51,915
G'night.
- G'night.

920
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:57,707
Shut up! You fixed this?

921
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,624
Why didn't you come into
my life earlier, Abhay?

922
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:07,832
But it's never too late, so g'night!

923
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:10,499
G'night.

924
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:17,665
Thai food!

925
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,040
Thai Tradition..

926
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:39,457
OK! Soup?
- Check!

927
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:41,249

928
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:43,165
Chicken Satay?
- Check. Check!

929
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,957
Green Curry?
- Check!

930
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,957
Hey, you guys!
- Rice.. - All set?

931
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:08,082
What? ls the dress too
short for the dinner party?

932
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:12,665
The colour, right, l
knew l should have worn red.

933
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:13,957
Froggy!

934
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:21,915
Ya? Ya! No! lt's just you..

935
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:26,874
You guys sure?

936

lt's true, Mom. You're

937
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,415
Hey!

938
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,582
Hi! Sumitra, l'm so glad you
could make it. Please come in.

939
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:39,165
You look stunning!
- Thank you!

940
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,874
This is a small gift from us.

941
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:43,957
Oh! That's really kind of you,
thank you so much! Come on in.

942
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:45,415

Good evening!

946

Hey!

947
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:58,082
Wow! You're looking beautiful.
A little something for you.

948
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:02,874
Thanks.. you shouldn't have.
Come on in. CP's already here.

949
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:05,749

- Ya, and his wife Sumitra as well..

950
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,749
Oh my God!

951
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:11,499
This is varun?

952
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:20,915
What happened, Froggy?
- What happened?

953
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,540
You're acting like
you've seen a ghost!

954
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:29,457
Tania. Do me a favour. Please go
upstairs. l beg of you, please!

955
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:34,707
Jesus, Froggy! Fine!
l'm going. Goodnight.

956
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,332
You guys know each other..

957
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,249
Hi.. how are you?

01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:44,957
Traffic sucks out here..
- varun that's Madeline.

959
01:12:45,916 --> 01:12:50,457
Sidhu is varun. varun is Sidhu.

960
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,374
Are we ready for dinner? OK.

961
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:09,749
Oh no! How will l be in front of him?

962
01:13:12,791 --> 01:13:14,207
Think, Abhay, think!

963
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:16,832
Alisha, you did a very
good thing by inviting varun.

964
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,874
So, then what's for dinner Alisha?

965
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:21,665
Oh! You'll find out soon enough.
First a toast!

966
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,790
Oh God! Why did he
have to sit in the front?

967
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:25,999
To Unify?

968
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:27,707
To Pinnacle and Unify.

969
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:30,749
Anyway..

970
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:32,457
What are you doing?

971
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:39,915
Good evening.

972
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:53,249
For madam. Thank You!

973
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,457
What are you doing?

974
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:01,915
Amusing!

975
01:14:02,666 --> 01:14:07,040
l'm really sorry.. he just
likes feeding people.. backwards!

976
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:11,707
CP, why don't we tell varun
a bit about the presentation?

977
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:13,249
Ya, varun..
- Soup!

978
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:18,749
Strange!

979
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:21,332
Excuse me.

980
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:26,374
Abhay, serve the soup!
- No!

981
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:28,957
What do you mean, no?

982
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:33,374
Self-service! Thai tradition.

983
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:43,957
Apparently,
self-service is a Thai tradition.

984
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,832
Self-service it is!

985
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,040
Maybe some wine..

986
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:55,499
voila!

987
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,457
For you..

988
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:27,915
So..

989
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,624
Madam..

990
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:43,290
Soup!

991
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,457
Oh my.. my china!

992
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:50,957
lt's fine. Hi!

993
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:55,874
Continue!

994
01:15:58,375 --> 01:15:59,499
Amusing..

995
01:16:02,916 --> 01:16:04,040
Thai tradition?

996
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,915
Hello - Hello, madam! ls Mr.
varun Sanghvi there?

997
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:23,749
varun Sanghvi?

998
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:25,790
Yes, madam. There's a
phone call from Mumbai,

999
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:28,582
very urgent, for Mr. varun Sanghvi.

1000
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:31,999
OK, hold on please.

1001
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:36,665
varun
- Ya?

1002
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,249
There's a call for you on my landline.

1003
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:42,082
Here? For me? Strange.

1004
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:43,915
lt's.. it's right down the hall.

1005
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:45,457
OK, excuse me.

1006
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,374
Ready for dinner?

1007
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:55,790
Hello?
- That's a quiet entry.

1008
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:56,999
Hello?

1009
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:58,249
l hope you all like the food because..

1010
01:16:58,333 --> 01:17:00,499

1011
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,540
Prawns.. Ya, oh good, good.

1012
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:09,957
Curry and rice. Enjoy. Enjoy.
- Thank you

1013
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:14,207
Thank you, Abhay. -You're welcome.

1014
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:18,582
Strange.
- What happened?

1015
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,832
lt got disconnected.
Don't know who it was?

1016
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:23,540
Oh! l'm sorry. Bon Appetit!

1017
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:26,665
This Thai cook of yours..
is a bit strange..

1018
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,332
.. but he makes very tasty food.

1019
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:29,582
Ya..

1020
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:34,665
So Alisha, what do
we have for dessert?

1021
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:39,957
Surprise!

1022
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,915
Chocolate cake!

1023
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:54,290
Surprise indeed.

1024
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:59,665
Hello! Hello Sir!

01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:07,082
Let me guess, Thai tradition?

You know what?

1035
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:44,040
You look tired.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

1047
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:19,457
l'm so happy you had a good time.
- Ya, thanks!

1048
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:22,249
Thai tradition!
- Oh God! Ya!

1049
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:23,874
Nothing like it. Thanks so much.

1050
01:19:23,916 --> 01:19:25,165
G'night.
- Bye!

1051
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:31,332
Finally! A chance to be alone.
Some more wine for you?

1052
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:36,874
Sure. Thank you. To Unify.

1053
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:42,415
To.. you and l. Cheers!

1054
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,665
Cheers!

1055
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:50,124
Did l tell you how
absolutely stunning you look tonight?

1056
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,249
Actually you did.. but you can
tell me again. l don't mind.

1057
01:19:55,333 --> 01:20:01,290
OK, well l.. well
you are.. who is that?

1058
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:05,124
l'm sorry, l forgot, but that's my..

1059
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:09,332
Cook? Chocolate boy? He's still here?

1060
01:20:09,916 --> 01:20:11,040
Yeah.

1061
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:16,040
Don't you think he
should be leaving by now?

1062
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:21,999
Oh..
- Yes.

1063
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:28,040
Hi!
- Hi!

1064
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:31,749
What were you doing at
dinner tonight Abhay?

1065
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:36,540
What was l doing? Oh.. you know..

1066
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:39,999
Whatever! We'll talk
about it tomorrow.

1067
01:20:43,416 --> 01:20:44,832
And these dishes?

1068
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:46,207
These can be done tomorrow too, right?

1069
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:49,249
Ya.. but l don't like
leaving dirty dishes like this.

1070
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:52,499
l'll just finish it in two minutes.
lt's almost done..

1071
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:53,915
Abhay!

1072
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:04,165
Oh..
- Ya! Kinda..

1073
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:11,374
Oh, fine.. OK, OK, OK. So then ya..

1074
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:14,207
Ya.
- Ya, OK.

1075
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:15,999
OK
- l'll go then. OK.

1076
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:17,624
OK.
- Goodnight.

1077
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:18,915
Goodnight.

1078
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,457
He just left.

1079
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:23,915
Your wine
- Thank You

1080
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:28,957
So where did we leave off last?

1081
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,457
What the hell is this?
What's going on?

1082
01:22:16,166 --> 01:22:17,332
Tania!

1083
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:27,540
l'm really sorry, varun. Bizarre
things happen to me quite often,

1084
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:29,415
but this one even l
can't explain. l just..

1085
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,124
lt's OK, you're still very beautiful.

1086
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,832
Anyway, this means that you'll
have to take me out to dinner again,

1087
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:37,415
or let me take you out?

1088
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,207
We'll see.
- OK.

1089
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,999
Goodnight.
- Sweet dreams. Here.

1090
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:48,499
Souvenir, don't worry about it.

1091
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:49,749
Aw.. thank you!

1092
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:04,082
Thai tradition!

1093
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:32,749
Hello Sidhu.

1094
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:36,415
Abhay..

1095
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:38,332
Ya.

1096
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:45,207
Abhay.. good to see you again.
Please come join me.

1097
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:48,207
Sit down. Please.

1098
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:54,040
Cappuccino, right?
- lt's OK.

1099
01:23:54,833 --> 01:23:57,624
So, Abhay.. what
brings you to Singapore?

1100
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:01,874
You know exactly why l'm here.

1101
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:05,540
l've come looking for you,
to take my software back.

1102
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,665
The software that you
stole from me, Sidhu.

1103
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,999
varun. The name is varun.

1104
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:14,540
This is the problem with you people.

1105
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:19,999
Always so serious in life,
you've got to relax. Calm down.

1106
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:25,165
l'll relax once l
get my software back.

1107
01:24:27,541 --> 01:24:30,040
See, you're going on about that again.

1108
01:24:31,958 --> 01:24:35,665
Abhay, l'll only say this once,
so listen carefully.

1109
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:38,499
ln this world there
are two types of people.

1110
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:44,999
People like you, who make things, and
people like me who sell those things.

1111
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:50,124
And in today's day and
age without people like me,

1112
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,874
people like you would be nowhere.

1113
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:56,582
l mean, take a look at yourself.

1114
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:59,915
You still live with your
parents in their house,

1115
01:25:00,166 --> 01:25:03,915
and are a burden on them. That's sad.

1116
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:12,749
Why would anyone
want to invest in you?

1117
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:17,457
lts all about marketing, you
understand what l'm saying, right?

1118
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:23,332
Ya, l.. l understand.
l understand very well.

1119
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,957
But what you haven't
understood is that..

1120
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:29,290
.. if people like me
don't make things,

1121
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:31,499
what would people like you sell?

1122
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:35,374
And varun, whatever you
say can't change the fact

1123
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:40,540
that eventually you're
nothing but a thief.

1124
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:43,957
Thief? That's a big word.

1125
01:25:44,416 --> 01:25:49,874
Abhay, l'm just a businessman,
besides, do you have any proof?

1126
01:25:52,625 --> 01:26:00,290
No, right? Look Abhay, because
you're a good guy l want to help you.

1127
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:05,624
Abhay Sharma, right?

1128
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:09,957
This is a cheque for 50,000 dollars,

1129
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:14,415
you can only dream of
making this kind of money.

1130
01:26:17,583 --> 01:26:21,832
And this can be yours now,
just take it and go back to lndia,

1131
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:27,207
and forget about
this software. Take it!

1132
01:26:29,541 --> 01:26:35,332
You know, varun. l've spent my entire
life living under people like you.

1133
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:40,624
Even in college l
would do their homework,

1134
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:42,874
finish their projects, submit papers.

1135
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:47,207
l would do everything,
and the result was

1136
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:52,374
that people like you moved
forward and l got left behind.

1137
01:26:56,083 --> 01:27:00,290
But now, enough is enough,
l can't do this anymore.

1138
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:05,207
So put that cheque away, varun..

1139
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,790
.. because now l'm
not like that any more.

1140
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:13,499
Now l would rather help
myself and not you all.

1141
01:27:14,375 --> 01:27:18,249
Wow! That's great but you're too late.

1142
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:20,957
The deal is done, the
software has been sold

1143
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:23,040
and in a few days it
will be officially launched.

1144
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:27,665
This money is the only
thing you'll get out of this.

1145
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:33,749
You want to help yourself, right?
Then listen to me, take the cheque.

1146
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:40,874
varun. l'm giving you another chance,
return my software to me.

1147
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:46,832
Or else what? What can you do?

1148
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:50,040
Something l don't want to do.

1149
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:54,457
l'll have to show the entire
world that you're a thief.

1150
01:27:55,708 --> 01:28:00,082
You're a fool. This is the
difference between you and me.

1151
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:03,874
l've given you an
opportunity to change your life

1152
01:28:04,625 --> 01:28:08,874
but you don't want to take it.

1153
01:28:12,708 --> 01:28:14,540
You're forgetting one thing, varun.

1154
01:28:18,416 --> 01:28:22,040
Till l have this, my
life is in my hands,

1155
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:25,165
however much anyone
might try to rob from me.

1156
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:33,374
And one more thing, you can change
your life with this, not with that.

1157
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:40,624
Good luck. Go for it.

1158
01:28:42,791 --> 01:28:44,124
The exit's there.

1159
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:51,582
OK, varun.

1160
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:11,332
Excuse me.
- Yes?

1161
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:14,749
l.. l'm looking for the
recruitment office. Human Resources?

1162
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:17,249
lt's on the first floor.
That way please. - Thank you.

1163
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:26,290
Ankert University, California? Honours
student? Great qualifications. Good.

1164
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,457
So do l get the job?

1165
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:32,332
You know what kind of
a job this is, right?

1166
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,665
l know, Sir.

1167
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,790
You'll have to repair computers,
that's it.

1168
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:38,999
Sure, Sir. l can do that.

1169
01:29:41,083 --> 01:29:43,624
l don't think you
understand what l'm saying.

1170
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:47,082
This job is not worth your while,
its very simple, inferior work.

1171
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:50,874
How can l give someone
like you a job like this?

1172
01:29:51,958 --> 01:29:54,874
Sir, if you think this
work is too inferior then

1173
01:29:55,166 --> 01:29:57,165
think of me as an
inferior man and give it to me.

1174
01:29:59,791 --> 01:30:02,249
OK. Come to work from tomorrow.

1175
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:04,082
Sir, can l start from today?

1176
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:06,582
Of course you can! By all means.

1177
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:09,624
Thank you. Sir, l have one request..

1178
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:11,874
l won't be able to
come to work at nine in

1179
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:13,999
the morning as l have another job.

1180
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:17,040
As soon as l finish that l'll
come here.. if it's OK with you?

1181
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:21,624
Son, with your qualifications,
there are no time restrictions for you.

1182
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,290
Just finish the work properly.
- Of course!

1183
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:26,707
l know this won't be
too much trouble for you.

1184
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:27,874
Thank you, Sir.

1185
01:30:27,916 --> 01:30:30,207
Ask Helen for your uniform and
lD-card on your way out. - OK, sir. OK.

1186
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:31,540
Alright.
- OK.

1187
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:32,874
All the best, my boy.
- Thank you, Sir.

1188
01:30:32,916 --> 01:30:33,999
Take care.
- Thank you, thank you.

1189
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:35,165
God bless you!

1190
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:41,249
You will be happy to hear that the
media is very excited about this.

1191
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:43,249
Enquiries are pouring in so l have

1192
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:45,332
a little plan set up that l
want to show you. - Let's go

1193
01:30:45,416 --> 01:30:46,749
How we'll take this forward, yeah?

1194
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:48,207
varun, do you think we can put this

1195
01:30:48,291 --> 01:30:51,374
onto mobile phones as well,
the software for..

1196
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:29,249
Froggy! We're staging a
play in school on Friday

1197
01:31:29,333 --> 01:31:31,874
and the teachers
have put me in charge.

1198
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:35,415
And l don't know how
l'll manage this so fast.

1199
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:39,790
You'll have to do everything, Froggy!
You have to help me!

1200
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,499
Of course l'll help you, Tania.

1201
01:31:41,583 --> 01:31:45,540
Anyway it's getting late, say
goodnight, OK? Sweet dreams.

1202
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:52,624
You like my mum, right?

1203
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:59,207
Tania.. you shouldn't say things
like this. Go to sleep, OK? Goodnight!

1204
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:06,707
OK. But if you really do like
my mum then l can help you out.

1205
01:32:09,083 --> 01:32:10,790
Help? Help how?

1206
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:15,915
l knew it! You like her!
You like like her!

1207
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,499
No, no, no, when did l say this?
When did l say this?

1208
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:20,499
You don't need to
say anything, Froggy.

1209
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:22,790
lt's clearly written on your face.

1210
01:32:22,875 --> 01:32:25,165
Whenever mommy comes in front of you

1211
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,082
then you should take
a look at your face.

1212
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:30,957
You get that silly smile.
lts so obvio!

1213
01:32:33,666 --> 01:32:36,374
Tania, you do know that
you're just six years old, right?

1214
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:41,707
Yes! But in these matters
l'm your grandmum. So say!

1215
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:46,499
What?
- That you love my mum, stupid!

1216
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:50,749
Smiling won't help.

1217
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:54,999
lf you need my help
then you have to speak up!

1218
01:32:57,791 --> 01:33:00,665
OK..
- Ya, OK, what?

1219
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,332
Ya, OK.. l love her.

1220
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:08,415
l didn't hear you..

1221
01:33:09,416 --> 01:33:10,915
l love her, OK?

1222
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,290
How sweet! But there's a big problem..

1223
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:16,915
Problem? What problem?

1224
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:19,207
varun..

1225
01:33:19,291 --> 01:33:20,832
Ya, varun..

1226
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:28,874
And if l know mom then he's just
her type. She likes idiots like him.

1227
01:33:29,166 --> 01:33:30,332
What?

1228
01:33:30,416 --> 01:33:32,249
We'll have to do something, Froggy!

1229
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:37,040
And we'll have to do it quickly or
else everything will get ruined.

1230
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,874
But what can we do?

1231
01:33:39,041 --> 01:33:42,374
Don't worry! l like
you and l hate him.

1232
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:47,582
Meet me outside school tomorrow.
Tania will take charge. Give me five!

1233
01:33:47,833 --> 01:33:48,999
OK!

1234
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:53,415
So what's the plan?

1235
01:33:54,416 --> 01:33:59,832
The problem is that
you're just not mum's type.

1236
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:03,665
l know.. - And to change
you is also impossible.

1237
01:34:05,916 --> 01:34:07,582
So what should l do?

1238
01:34:07,666 --> 01:34:13,874
Nothing much. Just spend
sometime with each other.. alone!

1239
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:17,999
Alone?
- Ya, she has to get know you, stupid!

1240
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:22,207
But alone.. where?

1241
01:34:22,916 --> 01:34:25,665
At home. l've planned everything.

1242
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:28,582
l'm going to be spending
tonight at a friend's place,

1243
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:31,374
so that you two can be alone.

1244
01:34:34,125 --> 01:34:35,332
OK.

1245
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:46,999
Now you go to your
hotel and l go home.

1246
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:48,582
That's sad.

1247
01:34:49,791 --> 01:34:51,874
l'll see you tomorrow.
- Goodnight, sweet dreams.

1248
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:55,374
Goodnight
- Goodnight.

1249
01:34:58,875 --> 01:35:01,249
No Tania, you can't
watch Sex and the City!

1250
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:08,124
Watch Hannah Montana.. OK..
lights out at 1 0 o'clock. Bye!

1251
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:10,790
Abhay!
- Hi..

1252
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:13,790
You're still here.. let me help you.

1253
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:27,790
l need some advice from you.. again!

1254
01:35:28,666 --> 01:35:29,915
Ya, sure! Of course.

1255
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:36,207
You know varun? Remember the
guy l spoke to you about and..

1256
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:38,582
l think you met him at dinner.
- Ya, ya, ya..

1257
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:43,915
Thai tradition.. so what do you think?

1258
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,332
What do you think about him?

1259
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:49,082
l don't understand.

1260
01:35:49,916 --> 01:35:55,957
OK. l think. l think
he's going to ask me out,

1261
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:58,915
like on a date.. officially..

1262
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:06,415
and l don't know what l want..
so what do you think?

1263
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,582
What should l do?

1264
01:36:09,333 --> 01:36:14,790
Well.. do you love him?

1265
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:18,749
Love? No, no, no, no.
lt's too soon, l mean..

1266
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:24,165
and anyway.. love is a fantasy.

1267
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:27,582
Not that l'm negative
about love or anything.

1268
01:36:27,666 --> 01:36:31,874
ln fact in school and college l used
to believe in love and fairytales.

1269
01:36:31,916 --> 01:36:35,082
You know, l used to believe
that my prince charming would come

1270
01:36:35,166 --> 01:36:39,582
and carry me off on his motorcycle.

1271
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,790
And someone did come into my life,

1272
01:36:44,875 --> 01:36:48,665
except that he wasn't
any prince charming.

1273
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:54,790
Anyway, after that l stopped
believing in these things.

1274
01:36:54,875 --> 01:37:01,457
Cause.. now if l find
anyone who keeps me happy

1275
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,749
and more importantly accepts
Tania in his life, then that's all.

1276
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:09,749
That's more than enough.

1277
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:14,249
And do you feel that
varun is that guy?

1278
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,249
Maybe..

1279
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:26,290
Well if he makes you
happy then l mean,

1280
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:29,165
l mean you should do
whatever makes you happy.

1281
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:34,999
You're right.

1282
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:43,790
ln any case, what are you doing here?

1283
01:37:44,208 --> 01:37:48,082
All this can be done tomorrow. And
even Tania is at her friend's place.

1284
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:50,374
You could have had the evening off.

1285
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:52,999
What would l have done
with an evening off?

1286
01:37:53,083 --> 01:37:55,332
You know, l would have
just got bored in Singapore..

1287
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,665
Are you kidding?

1288
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:59,874
Singapore is such a nice place,
and the girls here are very pretty.

1289
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:02,124
You're a single guy,
you should be having fun.

1290
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:06,999
l can't do all this!

1291
01:38:07,875 --> 01:38:11,415
Why not? C'mon! You never know, right?

1292
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:14,832
lt's possible that some
special girl is waiting for you here

1293
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:18,624
and she'll never find you because
you'll be here doing the dishes.

1294
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:24,165
Such special girls don't
wait for guys like me.

1295
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:26,540
What kind of logic is that? Why not?

1296
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:31,290
Because just like you..

1297
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:34,540
these girls are also looking
for their prince charming..

1298
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:40,040
Fine..
- Ya.. and l'm no prince charming.

1299
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:45,790
l mean take a look at yourself,
you're a beautiful girl.

1300
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:48,040
You're beautiful and..

1301
01:38:48,916 --> 01:38:50,165
Thanks!

1302
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,749
You're welcome!

1303
01:38:54,833 --> 01:38:59,332
lf you go out looking for men,
there will be a line outside your door.

1304
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:04,457
There's not going to be a line-up
of girls waiting for me. l doubt it.

1305
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:06,999
Do you seriously believe that
people are attracted to each other

1306
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:10,957
only on the basis of their looks,
cause that's really shallow.

1307
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:15,874
Ya! l agree, but that's the way of
the world. l didn't make these rules.

1308
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:17,665
Well, it's a stupid rule.

1309
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:21,540
Because there are so many
other qualities besides beauty.

1310
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:25,249
Like intelligence,
charm, personality..

1311
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:27,249
Really?

1312
01:39:27,333 --> 01:39:28,832
Ya, really!

1313
01:39:29,166 --> 01:39:32,207
And if l prove you wrong..

1314
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:34,332
How?

1315
01:39:35,708 --> 01:39:37,082
Let's have a bet.

1316
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:40,165
l'll bet with you but
how will you prove it?

1317
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,415
What? Do you even
know how to use these?

1318
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,374
No! But that's the point.

1319
01:39:49,625 --> 01:39:52,457
C'mon, these are Tania's!

1320
01:39:52,791 --> 01:39:55,874
Even better! Black?
Do you like make-up?

1321
01:39:56,416 --> 01:39:59,082
Ya..
- Good! Time to take it off.

1322
01:39:59,875 --> 01:40:02,457
l clean my computer screen with this!

1323
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:07,124
Screensaver! Great! Now wear it.
And for the final touch.

1324
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,290
And you?

1325
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:12,249
Spare! Ready?

1326
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:14,665
l think so..

1327
01:40:18,791 --> 01:40:20,790
No way, man!

1328
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:22,374
Yes way, man..

1329
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,207
Are you mad? Who looks like this?

1330
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:27,207
l can't go out like this,
this is totally embarrassing.

1331
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:30,290
Makes me look totally stupid.
- So, bet's off? Give up? l win?

1332
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:38,874
Come on!

1333
01:40:50,416 --> 01:40:52,165
OK, fine, fine!

1334
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:55,040
Me here, like this.. what's the plan?

1335
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:59,082
The plan is, you here, like this..

1336
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:02,249
it's impossible that any
guy will even glance at you.

1337
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:06,790
What rubbish!
- Ya! - lmpossible!

1338
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:10,999
lmpossible according to me, but as
you can see there are so many bars..

1339
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:14,624
if you can get even
one guy's phone number..

1340
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:17,332
Then you'll believe me?
- Ya.

1341
01:41:20,458 --> 01:41:24,665
That's all?
- Ya, just keep it geek, yeah?

1342
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:30,040
Ya. OK. OK. l can do that,
that's simple.

1343
01:41:31,166 --> 01:41:34,207
Watch and learn.
- l will.

1344
01:41:46,625 --> 01:41:48,874
Everyone here

1345
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:51,040
may not be beautiful

1346
01:41:51,125 --> 01:41:54,874
yet, two hearts can still meet..

1347
01:41:54,916 --> 01:41:56,457
lt's possible.

1348
01:41:56,541 --> 01:41:59,332
Hey.. it's possible

1349
01:41:59,791 --> 01:42:01,915
Through the sheer strength of my heart

1350
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,124
l will find someone

1351
01:42:04,208 --> 01:42:05,332
And if not love at least

1352
01:42:05,416 --> 01:42:07,915
A phone number l will get

1353
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,624
lt's possible

1354
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:12,790
Hey.. it's possible

1355

l'm sorry, Alisha. l
didn't mean to upset you.

1425

lt's not your fault,
Abhay. ln fact, you were right!

1426
01:45:57,375 --> 01:45:59,540
l guess these are
the ways of the world.

1427
01:46:05,666 --> 01:46:11,874
Alisha.. l can't change
the way the world functions

1428

Thanks, Abhay.

That's the new Air with the

Does it have Snow Leopard? l

1435
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:08,332
What are you saying, Abhay?

You must really like these
computers and things, ya..

1437

Second?

1439
01:47:19,291 --> 01:47:25,999
No.. what l mean is.. whenever l
feel sad l come to a place like this.

1440
01:47:26,083 --> 01:47:28,874
ln fact, in
Singapore l come here itself.

OK, everybody. Tomorrow is
the launch of the software.

1460
01:48:57,416 --> 01:48:59,124
Alisha, would you run us
through the schedule please?

1461
01:48:59,208 --> 01:49:01,874
Yes, of course. OK.

1462
01:49:01,958 --> 01:49:05,707
So the event is scheduled to begin at
3 in the presentation hall and.. Oh!

1463
01:49:05,791 --> 01:49:08,290

01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,499
broadcasting it live across the world.

1465
01:49:20,208 --> 01:49:21,374

varun who will present the software

1468
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:31,874

open for questions and answers.

Oh, varun.. tomorrow is a very big day

1476
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:45,249
and l think we should both get
some rest. Some other time perhaps?

1477
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:46,415
Ya.. for sure, yeah. You're right!

1478
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:49,957
We need to get some rest.. ,for
sure but is everything alright?

01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:54,499
Ya! Of course. Good luck for tomorrow!

01:51:25,458 --> 01:51:29,040
Of course, T. - You have to
be there for the whole play.

1483
01:51:29,125 --> 01:51:32,832
Obviously! ln fact l've

Abhay?
- Ya?

1494
01:52:20,041 --> 01:52:25,249
Coffee? l'm making it so
you know it'll be special.

1495
01:52:29,875 --> 01:52:35,249

You can say anything.. anything.

1496
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:37,957
l'd love to.

1497
01:52:40,875 --> 01:52:45,082
lf you don't mind can l ask you a
question? lt's a little personal.

1498
01:52:45,708 --> 01:52:48,082
Ya, ya, ya.
- Don't look so worried.

1499
01:52:48,625 --> 01:52:50,874
No, no, no. Please.. please ask.

1500
01:52:51,875 --> 01:53:00,415
OK. So last night you told me
about your second love, right?

1501
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:05,499
So, l'm presuming that
there is a first love.

1502
01:53:05,875 --> 01:53:12,665
l know you've never had a girlfriend,
so what's the deal?

1503
01:53:15,875 --> 01:53:17,790
You really want to know?

1504
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:19,749
Ya.

1505
01:53:23,958 --> 01:53:26,082
So, ya.. there was a girl.

1506
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:33,290
The truth is that l'm
still in love with her.

1507
01:53:38,208 --> 01:53:43,582
Oh! That.. that's really sweet.

1508
01:53:45,083 --> 01:53:48,040
Wow! Who is she?

1509
01:53:51,708 --> 01:53:59,499
There is a girl. lt's been seven
years now and she still doesn't know.

1510
01:54:03,208 --> 01:54:06,207
ln fact, she doesn't
even know who l am.

1511
01:54:07,916 --> 01:54:11,124
Wait a minute. lt's been seven years?

1512
01:54:15,458 --> 01:54:17,124
Oh my God! You're such a loser!

1513
01:54:18,583 --> 01:54:20,874
Ya.. ya..

1514
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:26,165
That's ridiculous! You mean to
say that you've been in love

1515
01:54:26,875 --> 01:54:31,165
with this girl for seven
years and she has no clue?

1516
01:54:33,458 --> 01:54:36,499
You know that's stupid, right?
- Ya.

1517
01:54:36,583 --> 01:54:42,082
Any girl would want a guy to
be madly in love with her.

1518
01:54:42,416 --> 01:54:45,165
ln fact, she'd fall in
love with you there and then!

1519
01:54:45,708 --> 01:54:47,332
Oh really?
- Ya!

1520
01:54:48,416 --> 01:54:50,749
lf she does that
she'll be making a mistake.

1521
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:58,332
She should love me for me,
not just because l love her.

1522
01:55:07,125 --> 01:55:11,499
Anyway, where is she nowadays?

1523
01:55:12,875 --> 01:55:17,915
Probably having coffee in
some corner of the world..

1524
01:55:19,666 --> 01:55:24,290
with some loser.. you know how it is?

1525
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,374
Alisha.. l want to
say something to you..

1526

Ya well.. - l was going to

1542

How do you know him?

1543
01:56:58,166 --> 01:57:01,707
Abhay is Tania's nanny. He
takes care of the house.

1544
01:57:02,125 --> 01:57:03,249
Nanny?

1545
01:57:07,041 --> 01:57:08,415
Nanny!

1546
01:57:13,041 --> 01:57:17,415
Hi! Nanny. He's no nanny.
He's been lying to you.

1547
01:57:17,625 --> 01:57:20,624
His name is Abhay Sharma
and he is really my nanny.

1548
01:57:20,708 --> 01:57:23,124
He's a madman who's been
following me from lndia.

1549
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:25,624
He's been trying to steal my software.

1550
01:57:25,791 --> 01:57:30,374
He wants to steal it and fool us all,
right? He's crazy, Alisha.

1551
01:57:31,166 --> 01:57:34,957
By living in your house, he
wants to use you to get to me.

1552
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:36,165
That's a lie, Alisha.

1553
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:40,790
A lie? So tell me, haven't you
been following me from lndia?

1554
01:57:41,125 --> 01:57:43,165
Yes, l have been following him.
- Thank you!

1555
01:57:43,250 --> 01:57:46,582
Because the software is mine!
He's stolen it from me.

1556
01:57:46,791 --> 01:57:50,999
Your software? lt's his software?
You're lying again?

1557
01:57:51,083 --> 01:57:52,874
l'm not the liar, you are.
- l'm the liar?

1558
01:57:52,916 --> 01:57:54,540
Ya
- l'm the liar? One second.

1559
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:58,749
Alisha, why don't you
ask if he's a nanny at all?

1560
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:01,249
Alisha, please don't listen to him.

1561
01:58:02,416 --> 01:58:05,665
So answer his question then, Abhay.
- Please.

1562
01:58:07,875 --> 01:58:09,874
Are you a nanny or not?

1563
01:58:10,541 --> 01:58:11,665
No.

1564
01:58:12,791 --> 01:58:13,915
Exactly!

1565
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,790
And l'm sorry for that,
but this software is mine.

1566
01:58:16,875 --> 01:58:18,540
l was going to tell
you everything, Alisha.

1567
01:58:18,833 --> 01:58:20,999
Please give me a chance to explain.

1568
01:58:21,083 --> 01:58:30,249
What's left to explain? l
trusted you, with Tania!

1569
01:58:31,666 --> 01:58:34,124
Your daughter? With this thief?

1570
01:58:34,875 --> 01:58:38,165
l.. forget your software, Abhay.

1571
01:58:40,041 --> 01:58:41,915
Do l even know you?

1572
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:46,165
Alisha, please,
you've got to believe me.

1573
01:58:46,333 --> 01:58:52,332
l can't, Abhay! l just can't!

1574
01:58:54,375 --> 01:58:56,540
Don't do this, Alisha, please!

1575
01:59:00,416 --> 01:59:01,582
Just go.

1576
01:59:02,583 --> 01:59:03,957
Alisha..
- You gotta leave.

1577
01:59:04,208 --> 01:59:06,457
Alisha..
- Now! You gotta leave now! - Alisha!

1578
01:59:06,541 --> 01:59:14,040
Please leave! Now! Leave
now and don't come back.

1579
01:59:27,833 --> 01:59:29,165
You'll be OK?

1580
01:59:29,875 --> 01:59:37,332
Ya.. ya l'll be fine. l'm..
l'm sorry, varun. l think..

1581
01:59:38,875 --> 01:59:41,124

lt's been seven years now

And where is Froggy?
Why didn't he come?

02:04:20,333 --> 02:04:24,374
He didn't come because

We'll have to look for him.

02:07:05,333 --> 02:07:10,207
like l'm some
princess who can't love you.

1701
02:07:13,916 --> 02:07:15,790
l'm just a girl, Abhay,

1702
02:07:18,625 --> 02:07:21,082
who's always looked for
love in the wrong places.

1703
02:07:23,375 --> 02:07:28,415
When actually, true love
was always in front of me..

1704
02:07:31,333 --> 02:07:35,457
l just couldn't see it..
'cause that's just me..

1705
02:07:35,541 --> 02:07:38,207
.. l'm stupid like that.

1706
02:07:44,708 --> 02:07:46,874
l'm just a girl, Abhay

1707
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:55,082
but with you l feel like a princess..

1708
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:07,374
So please just come out
'cause you're not the loser..

1709
02:08:09,416 --> 02:08:10,624
l am.

1710
02:08:18,458 --> 02:08:21,499
God, l really hope you're here..

1711
02:08:22,083 --> 02:08:24,957
l've always been here..

1712
02:08:37,375 --> 02:08:38,540
l'm..

1713
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:43,915
Just don't..

1714
02:08:46,833 --> 02:08:51,290
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
Today indeed is a great day.

1715
02:08:51,416 --> 02:08:55,665
A day when the entire world will
come a little bit closer together.

1716
02:08:55,875 --> 02:09:00,707
Pinnacle Technologies and myself
will present to you a software that..

1717
02:09:00,791 --> 02:09:02,915
Abhay, l know this software is yours.

1718
02:09:03,333 --> 02:09:05,582
A path breaking new Operating System..

1719
02:09:05,666 --> 02:09:06,874
Let's go!

1720
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:13,207
So without further ado, let me
show you what Unify can actually do.

1721
02:09:17,041 --> 02:09:20,582
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the future!

1722
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:39,790
Find Alisha quickly!
- l'll just check.

1723
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:48,374
Would you excuse us a minute please?

1724
02:09:49,458 --> 02:09:51,707
What's the problem,
varun? What is happening?

1725
02:09:52,333 --> 02:09:53,999
l.. l don't understand.

1726
02:09:54,541 --> 02:09:57,374
l checked everything
yesterday and it was working fine..

1727
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:01,082
Can you fix it?

1728
02:10:01,958 --> 02:10:03,540
l'm trying to..

1729
02:10:19,708 --> 02:10:21,207
Alisha! This launch
was your responsibility..

1730
02:10:21,291 --> 02:10:22,415
.. and you're coming so late!

1731
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:23,582
l know that ,CP.

1732
02:10:23,666 --> 02:10:26,665
Everything is falling apart!
Do something. Fix it! Now!

1733
02:10:27,875 --> 02:10:29,290
l'll.. l'll OK..

1734
02:10:33,125 --> 02:10:34,582
varun, l think l..

1735
02:10:34,666 --> 02:10:35,874
l'll just..

1736
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,915
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1737
02:10:42,958 --> 02:10:45,665
l have a very important
announcement to make here today.

1738
02:10:46,458 --> 02:10:49,915
The reason why Unify is not working

1739
02:10:50,458 --> 02:10:52,665
is because Mr. varun Sanghvi is not..

1740
02:10:52,750 --> 02:10:54,832
.. the original
programmer of this software.

1741
02:10:57,041 --> 02:10:58,165
What?

1742
02:11:05,083 --> 02:11:06,207
Alisha, what are you doing?

1743
02:11:06,291 --> 02:11:09,415
l'm really sorry, but varun is not
the original programmer of Unify.

1744
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,749
Just.. just trust me. Please!

1745
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,624
l'd like to call upon the
original programmer of this software.

1746
02:11:20,166 --> 02:11:21,790
Mr. Abhay Sharma.

1747
02:12:03,208 --> 02:12:04,999
Alisha! Have you gone mad?

1748
02:12:05,083 --> 02:12:06,915
You know l've developed this
software, not that crazy guy!

1749
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,332
varun, don't..
- Alisha, explain!

1750
02:12:09,416 --> 02:12:12,040
CP, you trust me, right? Just listen
to Abhay once, that's all l'm saying.

1751
02:12:12,125 --> 02:12:13,874
CP..
- varun, shut up!

1752
02:12:14,416 --> 02:12:17,124
CP.. what is happening?
l just can't take this!

1753
02:12:17,708 --> 02:12:20,582
varun. l want to
hear what he has to say.

1754
02:12:20,666 --> 02:12:22,457
Thank you! Abhay..

1755
02:12:26,041 --> 02:12:29,624
l told you, varun. l
also gave you a chance.

1756
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:35,915
You didn't listen to me. Now
l'm sorry. Sir, he's a fraud.

1757
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,165
He met me in Mumbai,

1758
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:39,874
stole my software and came to
Singapore to sell it to you.

1759
02:12:39,916 --> 02:12:42,874
Whatever he's said to you is a lie.
He's nothing but a thief.

1760
02:12:42,916 --> 02:12:45,915
CP, this man is crazy.
Anyway, what proof does he have?

1761
02:12:46,083 --> 02:12:47,332
The proof is in
front of your eyes, sir.

1762
02:12:47,416 --> 02:12:49,415
What do you mean?
- On the screen.

1763
02:12:52,250 --> 02:12:53,874
OK, so you're
responsible for all of this?

1764
02:12:53,916 --> 02:12:56,082
lf he locked the software with a
password what am l supposed to do?

1765
02:12:56,166 --> 02:12:58,999
And how did he get access to the..
- Ya! l've done it.

1766
02:12:59,166 --> 02:13:02,082
But according to you, you made
this software. - Yes, of course!

1767
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:05,165
So if that's true and
anyone locks it with a password,

1768
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:07,582
then you should be
able to bypass it easily.

1769
02:13:07,666 --> 02:13:10,415
Sir, a real programmer would
know this software so well

1770
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:12,082
that he'd easily be
able to restart it.

1771
02:13:12,166 --> 02:13:13,332
CP!
- Just ask him to start it!

1772
02:13:13,416 --> 02:13:14,499
CP! l don't know
what he's talking about!

1773
02:13:14,583 --> 02:13:15,665
Just get the password
and get him out of here..

1774
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:16,874
varun, why don't you do something?

1775
02:13:16,958 --> 02:13:20,374
Because he can't. You
know that even if you want,

1776
02:13:20,458 --> 02:13:24,082
you can never restart it because
you never created this software.

1777
02:13:24,666 --> 02:13:27,957
CP..
- Abhay, can you start this software?

1778
02:13:28,458 --> 02:13:30,874
Ya, l just have to enter
the password and it'll start.

1779
02:13:30,916 --> 02:13:32,249
Fine! Fine!

1780
02:13:40,291 --> 02:13:41,707
You bastard!

1781
02:13:42,166 --> 02:13:43,999
What is it? What's the password?
Give it to me.

1782
02:13:44,083 --> 02:13:46,915
l'll give you the password but
you'll have to promise me that you'll

1783
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,124
Give Abhay the exact same deal
that you gave varun. Exact same, CP.

1784
02:13:51,208 --> 02:13:54,582
OK, promise. Exact same..
now give me the password.

1785
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:57,124
OK, what is the password?

1786
02:13:58,083 --> 02:14:00,332
You give the password..

1787
02:14:02,458 --> 02:14:06,040
Abhay, l don't know the password.
What's the password?

1788
02:14:07,125 --> 02:14:08,874
Of course you know what
the password is, Alisha.

1789
02:14:09,875 --> 02:14:12,207
lf you don't know then who will..

1790
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,874
Can one of you please give
me the password? Please!

1791
02:14:19,875 --> 02:14:23,332
Alisha! Alisha!

1792
02:14:32,625 --> 02:14:34,415
That's your password CP..

1793
02:14:34,875 --> 02:14:36,082
What?

1794
02:14:36,166 --> 02:14:40,374
Alisha.. my name.

1795
02:15:04,791 --> 02:15:07,749
Congratulations! Today
you've become a really rich man.

1796
02:15:10,875 --> 02:15:12,374
Sir, this way please.

1797
02:15:24,875 --> 02:15:26,707
l.. l think l should.

1798
02:15:26,875 --> 02:15:28,332
l think you should..

1799
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:35,582
Just say it..

1800
02:15:39,833 --> 02:15:41,124
l love you..

1801
02:15:43,166 --> 02:15:44,415
l know..

1802
02:16:07,208 --> 02:16:11,457
Froggy! So you finally gave
the play a happy ending, right?

1803
02:16:12,750 --> 02:16:14,707
Ya!
- Come here, you.

1804
02:16:18,291 --> 02:16:21,124
l told you, son.. it's possible.

1805
02:16:38,916 --> 02:16:48,915
