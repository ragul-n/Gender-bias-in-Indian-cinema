00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:03,523
and the villagers of Baraunda

Produced and directed by: MANI KAUL

8
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:51,754
It is believed that for many years
a ghost lived in this banyan tree

9
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:35,264
The ghost saw the beautiful bride
and was bewitched by her radiance

10
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:11,231
Suddenly he was overcome by a strong desire
to enter the bride's body

11
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:15,947
The thought threw him into a confusion
such as he had never felt before

12
00:06:16,863 --> 00:06:21,070
Hardly had the cart moved on
when the ghost fainted

13
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:25,438
Meanwhile, sitting in the bullock cart,
the bridegroom too was troubled and confused

14
00:06:25,438 --> 00:06:29,833
His wedding accounts
did not tally!

15
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,679
For a merchant, correct
accounts are vital

16
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,711
Nature will allow
no error in her books

17
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:38,751
How, then, can a merchant?

18
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:52,009
I said to my husband:

19
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:54,900
"Please take a
look over there...

20
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:58,131
"Look at the lovely
fruit growing on that bush

21
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:02,572
"Won't you climb down
and fetch me some?"

22
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:06,771
He replied: "Only
peasants eat this fruit!

23
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:09,344
"What an add idea!

24
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:13,862
"If you want fruit, eat
what we have here instead"

25
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:21,194
"If you won't." I said.
"I'll get them myself!"

26
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:26,713
"Don't tell them about
the fruit at home."

27
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:30,882
I said to her
"Everyone will mock us!"

28
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,212
"Let them!"

29
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:35,440
So said the bride...

30
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,246
...and stepped
out of the cart

31
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,502
Now I know what it is

32
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:21,498
He's so scared of his father, he
can think of nothing but his books!

33
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:32,194
The wedding is over
and done with...

34
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:34,523
But the accounts are not!

35
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:38,449
Once the wedding
accounts are done...

36
00:08:38,526 --> 00:08:42,125
...I must leave for
Disawar, tomorrow morning!

37
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:55,790
You may not realize it...

38
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,370
...but there may never again be such
an auspicious time for our business

39
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:18,709
The bride was upset to hear of
her husband leaving her so soon

40
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,946
Even the fruit
seemed tasteless now

41
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,689
She felt lost and abandoned

42
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,974
What terrible news this was!

43
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,304
The bride could
not believe her ears

44
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,327
Didn't I tell
you not to eat it?

45
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:35,700
This fruit is only
fit for peasants!

46
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,259
People like us cannot like it

47
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,134
There, you see?

48
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:50,080
You threw it away, after all!

49
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:54,627
After picking it
in the midday sun!

50
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,424
The bride did not utter a word

51
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:37,180
Sitting silently
in the cart...

52
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,863
...her thoughts wandered
back to her parents' home

53
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:44,823
She remembered her
mother and father...

54
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,854
The companionship
of her friends...

55
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:52,231
Her brothers...

56
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:55,635
The pond where
she used to play...

57
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,115
The songs they sang...

58
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,876
Her dolls and her toys...

59
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:09,044
And the games they played

60
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:39,020
There, take it and go,
quickly... Next one!

61
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:44,052
There, take it and go,
quickly... Next one!

62
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,829
Be diligent and
tend to your chores

63
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:13,621
Take care of your
parents-in-law

64
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:19,079
Remember, our honour
lies in our hands

65
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:22,833
Let us not give
in to temptation

66
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:29,807
We will only have to
suffer the consequences

67
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,032
Five years is no time at all

68
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:39,498
Time flies by. I'll be
back before you know it

69
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,461
You have all you need here...

70
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:51,630
The house, the
lamps, the comfort

71
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:55,447
Do not let any
temptation sway you...

72
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:57,287
...while I am gone

73
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:06,873
Five years will
be gone in a flash!

74
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:35,873
The bridegroom left his father's
village and set out for Disawar

75
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,898
He planned to make
a fortune there

76
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,256
He carried one small bag...

77
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:43,311
...containing
all his belongings

78
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:46,190
The horizon beyond
held great visions...

79
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:49,073
...of wealth and prosperity

80
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:26,455
Hidden in the banyan
tree, the ghost looked out

81
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:29,368
And recognized the
bridegroom at once

82
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:33,088
Putting on a human shape
he appeared the bridegroom

83
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,953
"Brother," he said,
"it's barely daybreak

84
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:41,283
"Where are you going
at this early hour?"

85
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,791
"It's not too early in
Disawar." said the bridegroom

86
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:48,927
"I am going to live and
work there for five years

87
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:54,457
I must not let my chance slip by.
I may never be so blessed again"

88
00:19:57,134 --> 00:20:02,794
The ghost carefully observed the
bridegroom's each and every gesture

89
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,415
And he thought to himself:

90
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:07,544
"What if I took on
his shape and form...

91
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:10,324
"And appeared in
his village tomorrow?

92
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:13,245
"No one will question
me for five years

93
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,993
"Even the bride won't be
able to tell the difference"

94
00:22:48,495 --> 00:22:50,545
Father, may I speak to you?

95
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,801
I met a sage this
morning, on my journey

96
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:56,306
His body was covered in a rash

97
00:22:56,484 --> 00:23:00,477
I removed all trace of it.
I bathed him and fed him

98
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:03,495
The great sage
granted me a boon.

99
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,724
He said that every morning...

100
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,715
...I shall find five
gold coins when I awake

101
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,741
But I must not go to Disawar

102
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,708
What shall I do, Father?
I await your decision

103
00:24:56,853 --> 00:25:00,003
I knew in my heart
that you would return

104
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:09,285
Who knows where your
heart was right or wrong?

105
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:13,768
But make sure first. I could
be someone else in disguise

106
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:17,971
Perhaps I'm not your husband

107
00:25:18,947 --> 00:25:24,144
I could be deceiving you

108
00:25:52,015 --> 00:25:54,339
You are exactly
as I remember you

109
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:57,219
The same face...

110
00:25:57,608 --> 00:25:59,303
The same eyes...

111
00:26:00,388 --> 00:26:02,437
The same way of speaking...

112
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:04,205
You are the same in every way

113
00:26:10,255 --> 00:26:15,359
Then the ghost told the
young bride the true story

114
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,494
He told her how he saw
her under the banyan tree

115
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:25,074
How, for love of her. He
had deceived her husband

116
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:29,172
And came to the village in
her husband's form and shape

117
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:31,926
And how he invented
the story about the sage

118
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:35,854
He told her the whole
truth, hiding nothing

119
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:44,048
His family cares
only for gold...

120
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,584
And the money from
the family shop

121
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:52,561
If I hadn't told
you the truth...

122
00:26:52,634 --> 00:26:56,447
No one would have suspected me

123
00:26:57,602 --> 00:27:00,267
You would have received
me as your husband

124
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:02,708
But I couldn't deceive you

125
00:27:40,121 --> 00:27:43,142
I shall do
whatever you tell me

126
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:47,235
Now you know the truth.
I have hidden nothing

127
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:52,549
I don't know

128
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:58,524
Perhaps it would have been
better had you remained silent

129
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:01,481
What is best? The
false or the truth?

130
00:28:01,797 --> 00:28:03,704
I cannot decide

131
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,265
To parents, a daughter is like
a weed that must be uprooted

132
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:02,184
It's not the same with a son

133
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:04,578
As soon as I was
sixteen years old...

134
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:08,434
...they married me
off and sent me away

135
00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:11,361
The comfort and security
of my mother's womb...

136
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,379
...is a distant memory
here in my husband's home

137
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:04,093
When my money-mad
husband left me...

138
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:06,765
...I could not hold him back

139
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:11,033
Yet I have asked
the ghost to stay

140
00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:15,035
If I could not stop the
man who was leaving...

141
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:18,579
...how am I to send
away the one who is here?

142
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,720
If we had not stopped under
the banyan tree that day...

143
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,320
...God knows how these
four years would have passed

144
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,220
It would have been
impossible to bear

145
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,130
No, for you, the years
would have gone by somehow

146
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,990
But think how I
would have suffered...

147
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:55,930
...wandering from tree to
tree, restless and hungry

148
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:16,850
Here you are,
come and take some

149
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,320
Here you are,
come and take some

150
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,600
Here you are,
come and take some

151
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:32,520
Here you are,
come and take some

152
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:43,660
Here you are,
come and take some

153
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,660
Here you are,
come and take some

154
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,820
Here you are,
come and take some

155
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,900
One day, some villagers
came to Disawar...

156
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,290
...and were amazed to
see the bridegroom there

157
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,710
"When did you leave
home?" they asked him

158
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:44,380
"Years ago!" answered the bridegroom,
astounded by their question

159
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,770
"But we saw you in the village only
a few days ago." The merchants said

160
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,530
He did not believe them
And said to himself:

161
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,890
"They are jealous
of my success...

162
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,830
"...and want to
destroy my happiness"

163
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,750
One morning a trusted neighbor
Came to give him news of home

164
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,200
He told him that the
bride was with child...

165
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,590
Or had perhaps
already given birth

166
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,950
No, this cannot be true.
My family would have written

167
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,190
I have sent them many
letters but received no reply

168
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,890
You are a strange one!

169
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:24,040
Why should they write to you?

170
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,220
The bridegroom's
blood ran cold...

171
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,750
...as he listened to the man:

172
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,370
Their son never
went to Disawar

173
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:35,840
He came back after few days
and was recognized by everyone!

174
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,470
Now I see that you
are an imposter!

175
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,780
How can I be an imposter?

176
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,710
This fruit may only be fit for
peasants, but my wife likes it

177
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,120
And it won't cost me money

178
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,820
With this thought in mind...

179
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:39,040
the husband gathered
some fruit to take home

180
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,420
What sort of magic is this?

181
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,850
Two men, each looking
like one another

182
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:13,690
Two husbands who look the same

183
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,450
Which one is true,
which one is false?

184
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,040
I don't understand

185
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:01,440
The midwives explained
again and again...

186
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,270
...but the wife
still refused...

187
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:08,210
...to give birth to
her child by operation

188
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,060
Who are you? My son
returned long ago

189
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:28,070
Go away! Don't
make mischief here

190
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,150
I have been in
Disawar for four years

191
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,850
How could I have been
here with my wife?

192
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,370
I made a lot of money in Disawar.
I've brought my earnings home

193
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:52,060
Was that wrong of me?

194
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,520
It was you who sent me
away to make my fortune

195
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:04,720
Mother...

196
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,130
Will you too deny the son
to whom you gave birth?

197
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,220
These four years
were but a dream...

198
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:08,230
A lost dream

199
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,590
How can one expect
dreams to last?

200
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:13,380
They are built on quicksand

201
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,660
Why don't you ask my
wife about the fruit?

202
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,750
She will tell you the truth

203
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,480
You fool!

204
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:35,980
My daughter-in-law lies near
death, and you talk of fruit!

205
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,030
If you value your
honour, leave at once...

206
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,740
...or else I shall
have you thrashed

207
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,720
I do not want your money

208
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,920
So don't try to
tempt me with it

209
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,950
Go back to where you came
from, or I shall have you beaten

210
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,460
"Sethji," said the villagers,
"What's done cannot be undone

211
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,660
"If this young
man is willing...

212
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,610
"...why not let
him take the test?

213
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,050
"Please give him a chance!

214
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,780
"Ask your daughter-in-law to
tell you the story of the fruit"

215
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,420
This is a family matter

216
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:42,200
We will sort it
out by ourselves

217
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,210
I say that the man who has come
here with the fruit is an imposter

218
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,400
I shall ask my servants
to throw him out

219
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,220
Father, what is this madness?

220
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,400
Decide what you will...
but this is unjust

221
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,480
Brothers, why must
you insult my honour?

222
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,920
We must all help one
another in times of need

223
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,910
Solve this problem in
whichever way you will

224
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,790
But I tell you this man
is an imposter and a fraud

225
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,150
The villagers were pleased to
be The ones to settle matters...

226
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,760
And they insisted
on doing just that

227
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,850
"This matter must be
decided," they declared

228
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:48,230
"The guilty must pay!"

229
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,770
"We cannot permit the presence
of two husbands," they said

230
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,150
"Life will become
impossible if this persists"

231
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,360
Had a man asked me to
resolve this dilemma

232
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,600
...I would have
evaded the question

233
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:37,870
But when a woman asked me...

234
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,580
...I had to respond

235
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:30,090
"How can you expect
her to tell the truth?"

236
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:35,790
"We cannot sort this out,"
Announced the village council

237
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,640
"There will be an uproar"

238
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,190
"We shall send the two men
to the King" they decided

239
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:45,730
"Let the King decide
what must be done"

240
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,090
"The ghost, who had once
escaped from the tree...

241
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,740
...and had come to
live in the house...

242
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,910
...was now to be
brought to justice

243
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,240
He was to be
trapped yet again...

244
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:32,210
...to be hidden
away deep in a well

245
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:18,520
Brother, whatever the
King may decide...

246
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:22,100
...you know that I
am the Seth's real son

247
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:24,500
I am her husband

248
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,630
But tell me, who are you?

249
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:33,160
I am he who lives
beneath the skin of women

250
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,520
I lay claim to their love

251
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:42,400
I crave love and
affection above all riches

252
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:46,880
Don't talk such nonsense

253
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:51,130
Just tell me, did you
take the marriage vows?

254
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,180
What does marriage mean?

255
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,550
Life's mysteries cannot
be solved by simple answers

256
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,050
Where are you all going?

257
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:44,800
The story was explained
to the shepherd

258
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,420
He could see then what
all the fuss was about

259
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:55,440
Why trouble the King with
such a trifling matter?

260
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:59,540
Sit down and drink some water

261
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:07,220
You've tied these men up
as if they were criminals

262
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,380
Where could they escape to?

263
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,660
Listen, brothers

264
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:07,200
One of them must be lying

265
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,360
So why is it so difficult?

266
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,730
You could have
questioned them at once

267
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,350
I see

268
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,920
I understand

269
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,230
They have learnt to
lie and to do it well

270
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:25,930
That doesn't matter

271
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,860
I will know the
truth in just a minute

272
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:34,420
Whoever opens his mouth first to
admit this blade, speaks the truth

273
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,270
Well done, my son

274
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:42,420
You have spoken the truth.
These fools have ill-treated you

275
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:47,010
But I must test you further

276
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,590
I need a little help

277
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,930
I will clap my
hands seven times

278
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:24,030
Whoever gathers all the sheep
in that time is the true son

279
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,200
How amazing...

280
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:54,440
Who but true husband
could have such courage?

281
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,820
Let me set you one last test

282
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:00,570
I'll snap my fingers seven times.
Whoever gets into this first...

283
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,870
...is the real husband

284
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:04,640
Today he will be punished
And taught a lesson

285
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:36,280
Let me out! Let me out!

286
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:43,230
I want to live in freedom

287
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:48,520
Let me out! Let me out!

288
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:21,410
Let me out! Let me be free!

289
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:28,490
I want to live in freedom

290
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,200
Let me be free!

291
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,580
"When the bridegroom
went home...

292
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,020
...he went
straight to his wife

293
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,120
Every word he uttered...

294
01:13:56,430 --> 01:14:00,210
...pierced her
heart like a dagger

295
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,700
But she remained silent

296
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:07,590
She lay there as
if made of stone

297
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:10,690
Why are you so sad?

298
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:15,060
Even my parents couldn't
tell who was their real son

299
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:18,330
How were you to
know who it was?

300
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:21,710
You're not to blame

301
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:26,740
The ghost was taught a lesson

302
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:29,210
He deserved no better

303
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,690
When he was trapped in the
water-bag, he screamed for help

304
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,980
But who will
listen to him now?

305
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,010
We will never be fooled again

306
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,830
We had to throw
him in the well

307
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,550
And finally he
stopped screaming

308
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,950
The deceitful devil

309
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:51,350
He won't forget
this in a hurry

310
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,990
From that moment,
Whatever the family said...

311
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,110
...the bride obeyed
without question

312
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:55,370
She never protested,
never complained

313
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,760
Her
mother-in-law...

314
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,570
...made many special
sweets for her

315
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:02,070
She ate these without
uttering a word

316
01:18:02,530 --> 01:18:05,860
When she was asked to
wash her hair, she did so

317
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,530
She prayed

318
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:09,720
She served the priest...

319
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,580
...and sang with the women

320
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,660
She prepared many fine dishes

321
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:18,650
She covered her face with a yellow
veil at her mother-in-law's bidding

322
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:23,210
She rocked her child to sleep

323
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:27,280
...and put henna on her hands

324
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:29,680
She did all she was asked

325
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:35,100
It is rare to find such
a dutiful daughter-in-law

326
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:49,430
And on the auspicious night...

327
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:54,320
...she slowly
mounted the stairs

328
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:57,910
Her breast were heavy with
milk, her child lay in her arms

329
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:00,900
Her head was bowed...

330
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:04,480
Her heart heavy with sorrow

331
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,560
There, her husband waited
in sweet anticipation
