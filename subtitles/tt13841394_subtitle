1
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:06,865
Kasi, Vasu, Madhu!

2
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:09,147
They grew and studied together.

3
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:12,022
Madhu goes to her
apartment to eat and sleep.

4
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:13,710
She spends the rest of
her time with these guys.

5
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:17,397
Their lives were calm and peaceful.

6
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:18,967
The reason for this strife is,

7
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:29,555
Hey! Why hurry?

8
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:32,079
Even if you finish first,
you should pay the bill.

9
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,141
I will pay when she isn't there,
why should i pay now?

10
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:39,055
You have no choice
You’re the only one who has a job.

11
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,102
Hey! Get 2 Masala Dosa!

12
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:42,555
I’ll take away one.

13
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:44,587
Gosh! What is he doing here?

14
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,423
Who?

15
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:46,876
Hey! Don’t turn around.

16
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:48,219
Bangarraju and Prithvi!

17
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,719
Is it them?
- Is it those fools?

18
00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:51,610
What are they doing in Hyderabad?

19
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,516
Why should we worry
about why they came here?

20
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,985
If they see us, you
should pay their bill too. - No!

21
00:03:58,048 --> 00:03:58,649
Hey.

22
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,704
They look like Kasi and Vasu, right?

23
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:04,649
Are you sure?

24
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:06,510
Let’s find out
Kasi...

25
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,961
He’s calling you.
- Hey, Kasi.

26
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:11,548
Hey! He might call you too
Don’t respond.

27
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,008
Vasu.

28
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:17,352
They’re not them.

29
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:19,016
Hey! Give me the water bottle.

30
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:22,649
Who will open the bottle, man?

31
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:25,719
Give it.

32
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,298
Why are you washing your
hands with mineral water?

33
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:30,914
I use mineral water to wash everything.

34
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,743
Enough of this! Let's have a Biryani.

35
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,384
Let’s go.

36
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:49,219
Hey.

37
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,188
Hey, Bangarraju!

38
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:56,845
Haven’t I told you that
they are Kasi and Vasu?

39
00:04:57,032 --> 00:04:59,352
Bloody! I want to see you after your call.

40
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:00,274
Hi.

41
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:02,282
Why didn’t you respond to me earlier?

42
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,336
I didn’t hear you.

43
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:04,727
Is she Madhu?

44
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:05,868
Yes.

45
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:09,453
She wasn’t this pretty in childhood
She looks beautiful now.

46
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,134
Hey! Don’t mess with me.
- I was just kidding.

47
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,992
What are you guys doing?
- Don’t worry about us.

48
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,266
What’s with your attire and your luxury?

49
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,774
A man from Bheemavaram could buy a car and
live in luxury only if he’s a cricket bookie.

50
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:28,266
My status has changed along
with the growth of revenue.

51
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,298
I am not Bangarraju. I’m Bookie Bangarraju.

52
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:34,274
Are you into cricket betting?
- That’s for kids.

53
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,453
I am into something different.

54
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,141
Okay, I have some work.

55
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:38,875
I’ll stay here for 2 months.

56
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:41,321
There will be some matches, right?
You are getting a call.

57
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:43,946
Give me your number.

58
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,326
Hey, Kasi.

59
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:47,318
Tell me, uncle.

60
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,154
The merchant came home and
created a nuisance for money.

61
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,725
I pleaded him and he gave me 2 months.

62
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,849
We have to pay back his loan
of 40 lakhs along with interest.

63
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:57,380
Otherwise, our house might get seized.

64
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:02,584
Your parents asked me not to tell
you because you might get worried.

65
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:05,670
But, you need to know what’s going on
That is why I called you.

66
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:07,451
Okay, uncle.

67
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,131
I will arrange the money.

68
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:10,897
Take care of mom and dad.

69
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,943
Look at his attire!
- He has been like that always.

70
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:20,811
Is it a call from home?

71
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,358
Where is he?

72
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:24,529
He has some work
So, he left.

73
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,061
Did you take his number?

74
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:29,108
No need
You can easily remember his number.

75
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:30,552
What’s that?

76
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,779
The first and last number is 9
The rest of the numbers are 8.

77
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:35,732
You said he might ask us to pay the bill.

78
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:38,764
He paid our bill, gave
an extra tip, and left.

79
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:40,177
He got so lucky.

80
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,740
By the way, what’s happening at home?
- I will tell you. Let’s go.

81
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,638
Visu.

82
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,498
Why did you want to meet me immediately?

83
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:02,983
I want to discuss about my visa.

84
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:04,326
It is under process.

85
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:05,607
I will let you know when it gets done.

86
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,045
You have been telling me
the same thing for 10 months.

87
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,170
Everyone faces the same situation.

88
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,233
Trump changes his decision frequently.

89
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,529
I cannot do anything.

90
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,162
My situation is worse.

91
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:16,224
Stop the process and give me my money back.

92
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:18,562
I already told you
that it is under process.

93
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:20,943
You might get the visa
But, you cannot get the money back, Kasi.

94
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:47,193
I told you that he’d be here.

95
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:51,061
What are you deeply thinking
about like never before?

96
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:54,225
Did you meet the consultancy guy?

97
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:54,959
Hmm.

98
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,006
What did he say?

99
00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:59,537
I gave him money to go after him.

100
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:02,006
The one who gave me
money is after my parents.

101
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,600
Did he say that you’d get money back?

102
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:05,772
Do you think he would give?

103
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:08,404
He said I might get a visa
but not money for sure.

104
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,506
I told you in the beginning that your
plan to go to America is worthless.

105
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,326
Pessimist!
This happened because of you.

106
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:18,349
You made her buy a
newspaper to check the results.

107
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:19,733
Passed!

108
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:23,369
But, I gave my papers to you that day.

109
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,392
That’s why I got unlucky.

110
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,103
Forget it. What are you planning to do now?

111
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:30,579
I thought about it all day
and came to a decision.

112
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:31,392
What is that?

113
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:33,884
Cricket betting!

114
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:36,580
What did you say?
Cricket betting?

115
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:39,416
You already mortgaged your house.

116
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:42,111
You got nothing left except your
organs if something goes wrong.

117
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:44,791
Idiot! Stop talking negatively.

118
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:46,884
Forget about him.

119
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:50,134
Do you think it’s a good decision
with such things going on?

120
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,416
Don’t take hasty decisions.

121
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:56,408
Okay.

122
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,868
Give me an idea to pay
55 lakhs in 2 months.

123
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,915
Do you think cricket betting is perfect?

124
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,313
I don’t know if it is right or wrong?

125
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:04,618
But, I don’t have a choice.

126
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:08,572
Hey! It’s a risky business
Listen to me.

127
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,080
We can make money only if we take a risk.

128
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:15,315
Praying to God doesn’t get us money.

129
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,010
Why don’t you respond
to his philosophical talk?

130
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,127
Well! I thought you’d stop him
but you are encouraging him.

131
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:26,838
I leave it up to you.

132
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,135
I am hungry
I’ll go and eat something.

133
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,526
Did you call Bangarraju?

134
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:41,885
I don’t care about what he did
But, his beard looks like Virat Kohli.

135
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:46,713
Hello.
- Hey, Bangarraju.

136
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:49,322
This is Kasi.
- Turn on the speaker.

137
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:50,979
Tell me, Kasi.

138
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:51,830
Nothing much!

139
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:54,299
I want to do the betting.

140
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,025
I thought you’d talk to me about it
Okay. How much will you bet?

141
00:09:58,424 --> 00:10:01,760
Around 20000-30000 rupees.

142
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:05,447
I don’t do betting for such petty amounts
My bookings are high.

143
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,838
Okay. Do one thing.

144
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:10,807
There’s my friend named Murali
I will talk to him and share his contact.

145
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:12,549
Call him in one hour.

146
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,174
Okay, Send me his contact.

147
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,055
Why is he telling thirty
thousand is a petty amount?

148
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,797
If we settle well, that
might look like it for us too.

149
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:23,249
What if it doesn’t work?

150
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,390
Stop talking like him.

151
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,117
Go and arrange the amount. Go!

152
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:29,216
Okay.

153
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,677
My parents are attending
an event in the evening.

154
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,185
Ask him not to cook.
We shall order something.

155
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:42,935
Hey! Shall we eat pizza?

156
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:45,075
I already ordered it
Check OTP.

157
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:51,055
Okay.

158
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:53,391
What’s the update?

159
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:56,915
Bangarraju sent me his contact.

160
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:58,595
I am waiting for you.
- Do it.

161
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,735
Hello.
- Hello.

162
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:08,992
Is it Murali?
- Yeah, Who is this?

163
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,938
I am Kasi
Bangarraju gave me your contact.

164
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,423
Yeah, He told me about you
What’s your bet?

165
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:16,469
30000 rupees.
- Okay.

166
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:18,844
I will give you my landline number
Call that number. - Okay

167
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:20,610
Should I pay the money first?

168
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,492
No need
You are Bangarraju’s friend, right!

169
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:23,884
Okay, Bye.

170
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,016
Hey! Are you really into betting?

171
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,282
What will you do if you lose?

172
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:35,664
Hey! You always talk negatively
Think positive!

173
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:37,744
Hey! It is just 30000 rupees
Chill.

174
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:39,040
That’s not the end.

175
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:40,813
What do you know about betting?

176
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:43,813
I did some research.

177
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,454
You can do betting starting
from first to last balls.

178
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:51,063
If you bet on a winning
team, you get less profit.

179
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,212
If you bet on a losing
team, you get more profit.

180
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,470
What’s that logic?
I did not understand.

181
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:01,242
Let's consider the India-Pakistan match.

182
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,352
India should get 20 runs in 5 overs.

183
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,062
Who will win if there are six wickets?

184
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:07,461
Obviously, India wins.

185
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,438
Right!

186
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:10,507
Then, everyone bets on India.

187
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:12,468
In such situations,

188
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,360
If you bet 100 rupees on
India, you get 3 rupees profit.

189
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:18,531
But if you bet 3 rupees on
Pakistan, you get 100 rupees profit.

190
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,852
That’s called back in three.

191
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:22,000
You did good research.

192
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:25,250
He’ll go to any extent if he is interested.

193
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,625
Sir! Tip.
- Why? Will you give it?

194
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:34,500
Silly guy.
- Bloody.

195
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:36,789
Will you same some for us?

196
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:48,500
Madhu! He sent me the landline number.

197
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,734
I am really excited
I don’t care whether you win or lose.

198
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:05,578
Hey! Start it.

199
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:07,804
Wait..It started just now.

200
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,031
What team do you want to bet on?
- MB! – CB!

201
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:14,391
What do you know about cricket?
What’s the logic?

202
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:17,313
Blue is my favorite color, That’s my logic
Shut up and watch the match.

203
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:19,687
Hey! Don’t do betting
based on what she says.

204
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,968
You might lose everything
I leave it up to you.

205
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,125
Hey! You drink that
You start betting.

206
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,938
85/86 MB favorite!

207
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:32,320
Tell me fast.

208
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:35,828
Why did he end the call?

209
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,328
You have to tell fast
Many people are waiting.

210
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:40,486
What is 85/86 MB favorite?

211
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:43,688
Hey! Did you forget what I said yesterday?
Don’t get back. - Okay…

212
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:45,328
Blue wins. Bet on blue.

213
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:49,750
Hello.
- 88/89 MB favorite!

214
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:52,031
5000 playing.
- 5000 okay!

215
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,360
How much profit do we get if we win?

216
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,258
4400!
- What if you lose?

217
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:01,930
I lose 5000!

218
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,625
Yes!
- Yes…

219
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:15,499
Yes…

220
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,438
Hey…

221
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,578
Bloody idiot.

222
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:30,211
Fancy 91/92!
- Yes. 10000!

223
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:36,218
Yes.
- Yes...

224
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:41,187
That’s it, Come on…
- He hit it.

225
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:42,500
Hey.

226
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:45,110
Damn.

227
00:14:49,203 --> 00:14:50,352
Hey! Give me that book.

228
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:52,477
Give me the phone.

229
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,836
Kasi! Do you think we’d get it?

230
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:02,164
Wait...The match isn’t over yet.

231
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:04,680
Hey… Catch it.

232
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,180
Damn it.

233
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,688
Catch…

234
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:12,070
Yes…
- Finally!

235
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:27,422
Yeah!
- Yes.

236
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:40,563
We are screwed.

237
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:49,930
Damn! We shouldn’t have
gone for that fancy bet.

238
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,000
You won a few that I suggested.

239
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:54,656
You lost everything this idiot suggested.

240
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,883
Okay. I will not say anything.

241
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,961
Hey! Did you get angry now?

242
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:03,672
It is okay.

243
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,289
Don’t think about it too much.

244
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:06,828
We planned to spend 30000.

245
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,304
We lost 15000 rupees
That’s it, Chill...

246
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:10,766
How can I chill?

247
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:12,805
I cannot handle that stress.

248
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,688
Try to save that 15000 at least.

249
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:16,180
We can use it for our expenses.

250
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:18,524
Don’t worry, I will take care.

251
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:21,265
Okay, You guys worry about it
I will go and sleep.

252
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:25,727
Hey! There’s one match tomorrow.

253
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:27,852
Why are you feeling bad
as if today is the last day?

254
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,289
Get up! Cheer up!

255
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:30,531
Sleep now.

256
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:33,485
I will leave,
My mom already called me 4 times.

257
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:11,206
Hey! Let’s go to our apartment.

258
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,800
My parents might come.
- Wait.

259
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:15,519
I came here because
our TV is not working.

260
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:18,417
Let’s play this fancy now
Bet on the batting team.

261
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,776
He’d hit 4 his next ball.

262
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,636
He might get out!

263
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:25,644
There’s a lot that we imagine.

264
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:07,130
55/56…
- Yes! 1 lakh bet!

265
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,919
71/72…
- No! 1 lakh bet!

266
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,826
What’s the match rate?
- 18/20… Okay.

267
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:46,123
10/12…Okay!

268
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:47,334
Okay…

269
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:55,842
Back in three…

270
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,998
Back in three!

271
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:58,983
1 crore 70 lakhs bet!

272
00:19:29,822 --> 00:19:31,572
He asked me to come immediately
What must have happened?

273
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:32,682
I should ask that question.

274
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:37,963
What is it? What are you
doing here at this hour?

275
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,160
What happened?

276
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,799
What happened, man?

277
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:49,455
1.7 crores!

278
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,143
1 crore 70 lakhs!

279
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:53,158
Did you lose 1 crore 70 lakhs?

280
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:56,518
Damn! What?
Is it true?

281
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:01,244
Hey! Why don’t you talk?

282
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,776
1 crore 70 lakhs!
How do you think you’ll pay?

283
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,721
Keep me out of it…

284
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:07,627
You asked me to wait and see
Look what he did.

285
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,838
F**k!

286
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:13,932
What should we do now?

287
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:15,721
I have no clue.

288
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:17,002
That’s why I called you.

289
00:20:17,027 --> 00:20:18,901
You already screwed it up, Idiot!

290
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:20,604
Keep it out of it
I am leaving.

291
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:22,236
I will go back to Bheemavaram.
- Hey.

292
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,994
Whom are you calling?
Bookie? What will you say?

293
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:35,430
Will you say that we don’t have money
and we have to loot a bank to pay?

294
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:36,166
Tell me.

295
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:37,432
I am Kasi.

296
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,744
My account!
Yeah! I know, Tell me.

297
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:41,955
1.7 cr plus?

298
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,174
Got it, Call me tomorrow.

299
00:20:48,283 --> 00:20:49,884
Bloody idiot.

300
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,049
That one almost gave me a heart attack.

301
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:55,025
1.7 crores profit?

302
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,829
How did you bet that amount?

303
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:03,057
I earned 10 lakhs yesterday.

304
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:04,877
I got a chance to bet back-in-three.

305
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,729
I took a risk.

306
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:09,580
Forget it
Are there any more matches?

307
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:10,213
No more.

308
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:12,971
1.7 crores!

309
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,282
Hey! Where is Kasi?
- He is having tea there.

310
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:28,540
Hey! Why did you come
here without your phone?

311
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,196
There are four missed calls from your mom.

312
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:32,492
He’s been in that shock from last night.

313
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:35,657
I am accompanying him fearing
that he'd get a heart attack.

314
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:42,821
Hello, mom.

315
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:44,720
I will bring the money tomorrow.

316
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,774
Tell the merchant that I will pay tomorrow.

317
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:47,884
Okay?

318
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:49,470
Take care.

319
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:54,493
Should we get the money
now or will he give us?

320
00:21:54,532 --> 00:21:55,728
Let’s ask him.

321
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,290
Why did he reject the call?

322
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:04,478
Hey…Will he by chance cheat us?

323
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:06,196
Hey! Can’t you stay quiet?

324
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:08,126
You always doubt everything.

325
00:22:09,655 --> 00:22:10,264
Hello.

326
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,873
Hello Mr. Kasi.

327
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:13,936
You earned a total of 1.7 crores.

328
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:16,194
Will you take it through Hawala?
- Hawala?

329
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:18,123
Yeah! I will go for it.

330
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,350
Okay, Send me a 10-rupee note on WhatsApp and
details of the person who goes to collect.

331
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:25,913
I will send Hawala details to you.

332
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:27,475
Yeah, okay.

333
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,913
What is Hawala?

334
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:32,405
Illegal money transfer!

335
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:33,881
Why did he ask for a 10-rupee note?

336
00:22:33,944 --> 00:22:35,600
Proof that the money is ours.

337
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:38,936
Rajnikanth takes money
like that in 'Sivaji' movie.

338
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,505
But, he uses a 1000-rupee note.

339
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:43,670
Hey! That is Shankar's movie
So, he used a 1000-rupee note.

340
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,881
Our budget is low
A 10-rupee note is good enough.

341
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,669
Hello!

342
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:47,848
Mine is a lucky hand!

343
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,395
Give me my number.

344
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:55,927
Why take that risk?

345
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,567
Whose number will you give?

346
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,098
I have an old SIM card
I don’t know whose card that is.

347
00:23:01,302 --> 00:23:03,059
That works.
- Good idea.

348
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:06,708
The value of this 10
rupee note is 1.7 crores.

349
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,083
Give it to me
I will save it.

350
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:11,614
Okay, Arrange a car in the evening.

351
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:20,564
Why hasn’t she come yet?
We are getting late.

352
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:21,353
Shall I call her?

353
00:23:21,892 --> 00:23:24,017
She rejected my call
Go and check.

354
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,548
Here she is.

355
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,119
Hey! Why did you get a bag?

356
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:29,858
How will you get the money?

357
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:30,944
Okay. Let me see you.
- Give me the keys.

358
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:32,291
What?

359
00:23:32,322 --> 00:23:34,095
Three people should not go together.

360
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,658
Then, you can stay back
Both of us will go.

361
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,689
Shut up and get in.
- You come, He’s always like that.

362
00:23:50,673 --> 00:23:52,861
I am extremely excited
What shall we do with that money?

363
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,470
I should pay back the loan first.

364
00:23:54,744 --> 00:23:55,447
Oh!

365
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,236
We’d be left with 1 crore
15 lakhs after paying that.

366
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:00,509
If you lend it for interest, we
shall get 1.5 lakhs per month.

367
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:01,501
We can live happily with it

368
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:03,697
Forget about such things
We should buy a car immediately.

369
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,759
I can’t keep saying
cooked up stories to my dad.

370
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,166
Hi, Madhu.

371
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:11,720
What are you doing?

372
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:13,502
What?

373
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,502
Did you think about our love?

374
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:18,400
Don’t you dare talk about love again!

375
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:20,134
Haven’t you found anyone else?

376
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:21,588
How can you say that, Madhu?

377
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:26,048
I can try impressing engineering girls studying
in a college beside my house by climbing a tree.

378
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,892
Is it?

379
00:24:26,963 --> 00:24:31,259
Okay! Loosen your grip and head to a
medical college to see girls there as well.

380
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:35,485
Why don’t you accept him? He tries a lot.

381
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:38,025
Let me know if you are interested.
I will give him your number.

382
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,705
Yuck! I’m straight.
- Stop it.

383
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:43,196
Did you arrange the money?

384
00:24:43,235 --> 00:24:45,251
Yes, uncle. I am working on it.

385
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:48,072
I will arrange the money by tomorrow.

386
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:50,892
Don’t panic if my phone is turned off.

387
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:53,181
I will call you,
Okay, uncle.

388
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:55,994
Change the SIM in this phone.

389
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:07,826
Where did he ask you to come?

390
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,337
He asked me to come here.

391
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:13,546
Call him.

392
00:25:14,343 --> 00:25:15,296
Make a call.

393
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,445
His mobile is turned off.

394
00:25:28,148 --> 00:25:30,171
At what time did he ask you to come?
- At 10!

395
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:32,937
It is 9:15.

396
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,265
Why hurry?
We could have come after some time.

397
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:40,054
Why is this area isolated?

398
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,437
Today is Sunday.

399
00:25:50,937 --> 00:25:52,070
Call him again.

400
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:01,695
Turned off!

401
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,694
Shall we call bookie?
We shall tell him that his phone is turned off.

402
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,742
Why hurry? Let’s wait for some time.

403
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:10,211
Not hurry! I boasted about
money before my boss.

404
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,453
I'll be screwed if
something unusual happens.

405
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:25,656
Hey! He is Rakhi Sawanth fan.

406
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:29,882
Call him again.

407
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:42,359
Why did he reject my call?

408
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:44,054
Call the bookie now.

409
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:45,640
Tell him that this guy
isn’t picking up the call.

410
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:54,593
Damn! He is also rejecting my call.

411
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:56,351
What’s this twist?

412
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,000
Call Bangarraju.

413
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,906
Follow me, bro.
- Where?

414
00:27:03,492 --> 00:27:04,429
Let’s go to Amith Bhai.

415
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,195
Come.

416
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,644
Park your vehicle there.

417
00:27:35,214 --> 00:27:37,238
Madhu! This place doesn’t look safe.

418
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:38,917
You stay here
We’ll go and get the money.

419
00:27:38,942 --> 00:27:40,949
No. I will come.
- Try to understand.

420
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:43,042
We don’t know if that is a safe place
Wait in the car.

421
00:27:43,214 --> 00:27:44,206
We will be back in 5 minutes.

422
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,863
Wait. It is just 5 minutes.

423
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,121
Hey! Take the note with you.

424
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,386
Oh crap!
How can we forget this?

425
00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:51,081
Be careful.
- Thanks. – Thanks.

426
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,347
How can you forget it?

427
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,144
Hey! What sort of place is this?

428
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:01,824
Will he give us cash for sure?

429
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:11,105
Come.

430
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:26,350
Wait here.

431
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:28,967
Bhai! They came here.

432
00:28:30,983 --> 00:28:32,865
Did Murali send you? Give me the note.

433
00:28:42,506 --> 00:28:43,475
Move aside.

434
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:48,693
Count it.

435
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:54,966
Go to the store and bring a box.
- Okay, chief.

436
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,638
Why are you simply checking
bundles? Won’t you count?

437
00:29:00,663 --> 00:29:01,999
There won’t be any fault in Hawala.

438
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:03,990
Is it? How many transactions did you do?

439
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,131
46, 47, 48, 49…

440
00:29:06,193 --> 00:29:07,287
There are just 50 here.

441
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,029
You said there wouldn’t be any fault right?
Look what happened.

442
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:12,115
Why is there only 50, brother?

443
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:14,568
Our guy went to bring, right?
You’ll get it. Wait for 10 minutes.

444
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:27,678
How long do you need?
- He gave me 50.

445
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:29,928
They are getting the remaining amount
We are waiting.

446
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:31,592
I will come in 10 minutes.

447
00:29:31,662 --> 00:29:33,076
Okay, Come fast.

448
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,051
How long should we wait?

449
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:19,926
Sunday, right?
There is less money in the market.

450
00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:22,528
MPL is over yesterday
He will come.

451
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,361
Bhai! I did not get money.

452
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,970
Okay. I will handle it.

453
00:30:42,994 --> 00:30:45,799
Sorry. We didn’t get the cash.

454
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,158
What should I do now?

455
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:48,923
Do one thing.

456
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:51,549
I will give you another address
Go there and collect the money.

457
00:30:51,603 --> 00:30:53,814
Why? They told me that I
would get the total amount here.

458
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:56,857
That is true. But, I did
not get the money on time.

459
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,060
I told your agent that
I’d give it on Monday.

460
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,364
But, he told me that you want it today.

461
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:03,779
Okay. Where should you go?
- LB Nagar.

462
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,880
Okay. I will arrange the money on the way.

463
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,231
You can collect there.

464
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:09,169
Okay, Give me your phone number.

465
00:31:09,864 --> 00:31:14,426
9989515005. Okay?
- Okay.

466
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:15,146
Okay.

467
00:31:15,552 --> 00:31:16,083
Let’s go.

468
00:31:18,114 --> 00:31:20,154
Hey! We should go to Madhapur, right?
Why did you tell him we live at LB Nagar?

469
00:31:20,271 --> 00:31:21,426
Oh no! I forgot, dude.

470
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:23,880
Shall we go and give
our Aadhar Card to them? Silly idiot!

471
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:24,997
Got it, right?

472
00:31:25,036 --> 00:31:27,021
Stop asking silly questions and get in.

473
00:31:29,716 --> 00:31:31,583
Why are you not lifting my call?

474
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:32,732
Let’s go. I will tell you.

475
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:34,029
Are we heading home?

476
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,552
We have to go to some other place.

477
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:03,715
Hey! Stop the car.
- Why?

478
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,645
Shut up and do what I say.
- Okay…

479
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:16,965
What is he trying to do?

480
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:18,762
Both of you did everything
without telling me.

481
00:32:18,801 --> 00:32:20,598
Stop nagging,
Let’s go and see.

482
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:22,911
Hey! Sit inside.

483
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:24,833
Go and sit.

484
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:28,801
Hey! Fix this behind.

485
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:30,512
I don’t get it.

486
00:32:41,272 --> 00:32:42,092
Let’s go…

487
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:51,327
Hey! Why did you change the car number?
- I don’t want them to identify our car.

488
00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:54,155
What happens if they find out?

489
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:56,710
If they stop the car by chance,

490
00:32:57,428 --> 00:33:01,529
They'd arrest us for carrying a huge
amount of cash and seize the cash.

491
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,053
Will they not stop you if
you change the number? - No.

492
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:06,006
Does this number belong to Prime Minister?

493
00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:09,967
TS09PA

494
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:12,741
This is the police registration number.
So, the cops won’t stop us.

495
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:15,629
Looks like a good idea
Why don’t we make it permanent?

496
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:17,575
If we get caught, it would be a case.

497
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:19,364
This is just to avoid them stopping us.

498
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:19,958
Okay.

499
00:33:20,817 --> 00:33:22,794
How do you get such ideas?

500
00:33:23,942 --> 00:33:25,685
I saw 'James Bond' movie in the morning.

501
00:33:26,411 --> 00:33:29,786
They change number plates
with a button automatically.

502
00:33:30,294 --> 00:33:34,130
But, our budget is low
So, I changed it manually.

503
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,021
Call Venkat.

504
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:44,177
Hello, Mr. Venkat.
- Tell me. Who is this?

505
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:46,942
Amit gave me your number
He asked me to collect it from you.

506
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:49,552
He told me that
Where are you now?

507
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,911
We're at the Telugu Thalli flyover.
- Do one thing.

508
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,489
Reach out to State Bank parking at Koti.

509
00:33:55,646 --> 00:33:56,942
Bank?
- No problem.

510
00:33:56,974 --> 00:33:58,435
The gate remains open. Come there.

511
00:33:58,474 --> 00:34:00,388
I have some work
I will finish it and come. - Okay.

512
00:34:04,286 --> 00:34:05,724
Hey! Take a U-turn.

513
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:08,130
He’s asking us to come to another place.

514
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:23,646
I have a doubt,
Is it safe at the bank?

515
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:25,263
Isn’t it risky?
- Everything is a risky business for you.

516
00:34:25,302 --> 00:34:26,747
That’s a better spot
No one would suspect us.

517
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:28,544
Money remains safe in the bank.

518
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,364
How did you miss that logic?

519
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:32,075
It is Hawala, right?

520
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,778
I suspect why he asked to come near a bank.

521
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,630
That’s it.

522
00:34:38,364 --> 00:34:39,872
Kasi! There is a cop beside us.

523
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:47,489
Behave normally
Don’t look at him.

524
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:54,833
There is no traffic. Shall we go?

525
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:56,560
Don’t do such things.

526
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:58,255
We might get caught,
Shut up and sit.

527
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:09,083
Your dad is calling.

528
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,521
Drive slowly
No one is following us.

529
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,203
Hey! Fast…Fast..Go fast, Madhu
He’s coming.

530
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:30,368
Fast…Go fast!
- Shucks!

531
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:33,219
Go fast, Madhu…

532
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:35,125
I’m driving fast,
Stop irritating me.

533
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,309
Go…

534
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:03,566
‘His name is Ajay.’

535
00:36:03,669 --> 00:36:04,801
‘He is task force CI.’

536
00:36:05,145 --> 00:36:08,708
‘He doesn't care even a
beauty when he sees the money.’

537
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:10,754
‘He won’t give up the beauty either.’

538
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:15,340
‘He likes two things.’

539
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:17,403
‘First is his mother and
the second thing is money.’

540
00:36:35,747 --> 00:36:37,122
Son! Where are you?

541
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,254
I am at the station, mom.

542
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:41,379
Will you come home to eat
or will you come home late?

543
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:43,449
I will come late
You have it and sleep.

544
00:36:43,497 --> 00:36:46,246
Okay, dear,
You eat something. See you.

545
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:56,977

00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:01,984
Sir…

557
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:11,969
Don’t file Fir yet.
- Okay, sir.

558
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:15,118
I will tell you what to write.
- Okay, sir.

559

Make them wait at PS until I tell you.
- Okay, sir.

560
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:29,625
Tell commissioner that I went
out to handle a case if he calls.

561
00:38:29,672 --> 00:38:30,633
What case, sir?

562
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,969
Go and do your work.

00:39:17,377 --> 00:39:19,431
Hello.
- Where are you? Why so late?

564
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:20,955

You come and finish your work in 2 minutes.

566

567
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:56,272
Kasi! There is a cop beside us.

568
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:01,803
Behave normally.

569
00:40:02,452 --> 00:40:03,460
Don’t look at him.

570
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,883
There is no traffic. Shall we go?

571
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:24,579
Don’t do such things.

572
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:26,384
We might get caught. Shut up and sit.

573
00:40:45,953 --> 00:40:48,125
Hey! Fast…Fast...Go fast, Madhu
He’s coming.

574
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:50,212
Fast…Go fast!

00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:07,306
Hey! The number we changed
looks similar to that number.

00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:09,994
What? Tell me the number.

577
00:41:10,307 --> 00:41:11,447
Shucks!

00:41:11,494 --> 00:41:13,291
Yeah, it is the same.
- Go fast.

579
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,259
Go fast, Madhu…

580
00:41:19,314 --> 00:41:21,111
I’m driving fast
Stop irritating me.

581
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:41,268
We’re caught…

582
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:44,885
Go…

583
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:55,001
‘His name is Murali.’
‘He is a Cricket Bookie.’

584
00:41:55,272 --> 00:41:57,959
‘He works hard but his
boss enjoys the profit.’

585
00:41:58,217 --> 00:42:00,584
‘But, he tried to earn
some money for himself.’

586
00:42:00,756 --> 00:42:01,701
‘For that…’

587
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,936
Murali! Is that Hyderabad
Anchor still playing?

588
00:42:08,006 --> 00:42:09,357
No. He gave up.

589
00:42:09,436 --> 00:42:12,005
Did he settle everything?
- Yes, he did.

590
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:17,919
Is 2556 ours?
- Yes.

591
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:19,920
Why did we get a call now?

592
00:42:20,615 --> 00:42:21,326
Hello.

593
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:24,286
I will check the account and
finalize the amount. Send it.

594
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:25,341
Sir…

595
00:42:25,787 --> 00:42:26,920
What happened, boss?

596
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:28,201
I am screwed.

597
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:29,982
They caught our guys at the Miyapur branch.

598
00:42:30,107 --> 00:42:31,404
Hey! Stop, Close it.

599
00:42:36,678 --> 00:42:37,357
Hello.

600
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:39,201
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Reddy.

601
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:44,217
Mr. Malli! They caught the Miyapur branch.

602
00:42:44,404 --> 00:42:45,435
When did it happen?

603
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:47,037
Just now, It happened
around 10 minutes ago.

604
00:42:47,623 --> 00:42:49,130
Okay, I will find out and let you know.

605
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:49,943
Okay, sir.

606
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:51,591
Cancel all Hyderabad lines.
- Okay, boss.

607
00:42:51,623 --> 00:42:52,967
Connect all lines here.

608
00:42:54,756 --> 00:42:57,279
Prasad! Cancel all Hyderabad lines.

609
00:42:57,427 --> 00:42:59,068
Give them my line number.
- Okay, brother.

610
00:42:59,592 --> 00:43:01,045
Murali.
- Yes, boss.

611
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:03,561
Go to Hyderabad.

612
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:05,513
I confirmed Raju’s guesthouse.

613
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:07,717
You should handle all NPL matches.

614
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:21,286
Hello.
- Hello, Is it Murali?

615
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:23,263
Yeah, Who is this?

616
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:25,654
Bangarraju gave me your contact.
- Yeah, What’s your bet?

617
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:27,083
30000 rupees.
- Okay.

618
00:43:27,115 --> 00:43:29,442
I will give you my landline number
Call that number. - Okay

619
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,747
Should I pay the money first?

620
00:43:30,772 --> 00:43:32,568
No need, You are
Bangarraju’s friend, right!

621
00:43:37,154 --> 00:43:39,637
Did you tell anyone that
you're at the guesthouse?

622
00:43:39,662 --> 00:43:40,756
No. I did not tell anyone.

623
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,489
Did you check all accounts?

624
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,568
Yes. I’m working on it.

625
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:46,458
Okay. Don’t take any new
accounts until I tell you.

626
00:43:48,224 --> 00:43:49,974
Okay, boss.
- Take care.

627
00:44:00,052 --> 00:44:03,021
85/86 MB favorite…

628
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:07,552
85/86 MB favorite…

629
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:08,645
Tell me fast.

630
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:12,802
85/86 MB favorite…

631
00:44:14,935 --> 00:44:16,310
88/89 MB favorite!

632
00:44:16,372 --> 00:44:18,450
5000 playing.
- 5000 okay!

633
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:23,451
How much profit do we get if we win?
- 4400!

634
00:44:26,224 --> 00:44:28,012
Hello, tell me.
- Is the match done?

635
00:44:28,052 --> 00:44:28,606
Yes.

636
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,082
Where are you playing?

637
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,091
Hyderabad!

638
00:44:31,122 --> 00:44:32,904
Don’t tell anyone.

639
00:44:32,997 --> 00:44:35,333
Cops caught our batch last time.

640
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:36,530
My boss is scared.

641
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,466
Okay...What about you?

642
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:41,270
I am playing here
Do not tell anyone.

643
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:43,286
Okay, Why will I tell anyone?

644
00:44:43,311 --> 00:44:44,848
Are you playing for you?

645
00:44:44,896 --> 00:44:46,466
I opened a small account.

646
00:44:46,513 --> 00:44:47,770
I will give your contact to my uncle.

647
00:44:47,795 --> 00:44:49,772
It is useless to pay for the phone if
your uncle plays only for 500 rupees.

648
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:35,886
Hello, Ashok.

649
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:37,395
Is everything okay?

650
00:45:37,488 --> 00:45:39,050
I made a big mistake.

651
00:45:39,223 --> 00:45:40,504
What is it? What happened?

652
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,098
They earned 1.7 crores.

653
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,675
What the heck! How did you lose it?

654
00:45:44,723 --> 00:45:46,488
Back-in-three screwed me up.

655
00:45:46,574 --> 00:45:48,660
You told me that they’re new
How come they played that well?

656
00:45:49,402 --> 00:45:51,285
I don’t know, It is my bad luck.

657
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,738
He raised a bet on
back-in-three for 1.7 crores.

658
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,645
My bad! They scored it.

659
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:58,707
I planned not to pay but
they are Bangarraju’s friends.

660
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:00,566
I am under pressure.

661
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:02,051
Don’t worry.

662
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:03,512
How about Reddy’s book?

663
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:05,402
He is good, Positive earnings!

664
00:46:05,442 --> 00:46:08,613
If he is good, I have an idea
See if it works.

665
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:14,504
Hello..Amit Bhai.

666
00:46:14,582 --> 00:46:15,660
Hello, Murali. Tell me.

667
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:17,058
45 Lakhs in Chennai!

668
00:46:17,129 --> 00:46:18,925
50 Lakhs in Vizag!
75 Lakhs in Bheemavaram!

669
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:22,386
You’ll get it by noon
Make it ready by evening.

670
00:46:22,551 --> 00:46:24,090
Today is Sunday.

671
00:46:24,168 --> 00:46:25,598
1.7 crores is not easy!

672
00:46:25,653 --> 00:46:26,668
Why don’t you arrange it tomorrow?

673
00:46:27,762 --> 00:46:30,075
It is urgent,
My client wants it immediately.

674
00:46:30,465 --> 00:46:31,887
It is already late.

675
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,778
There are many more.
But, we can delay those.

676
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:36,706
Please do this for me now.

677
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:37,793
Okay. I will try it.

678
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,645
Not trying! You have to do it for sure.

679
00:46:39,793 --> 00:46:41,371
Should I send it or will
they come and collect it?

680
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,168
No! They will come.

681
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:44,293
I will send you their details.

682
00:46:44,512 --> 00:46:45,371
Okay…

683
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:46,465
Okay…

684
00:46:48,114 --> 00:46:50,770
Should we get the money
now or will he give us?

685
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:52,246
Let’s ask him.

686
00:46:58,437 --> 00:46:59,515
Why did he reject the call?

687
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:02,711
Hey…Will he by chance cheat us?

688
00:47:02,805 --> 00:47:04,390
Hey! Can’t you stay quiet?

689
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:05,812
You always doubt everything.

690
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,034
Hello Mr. Kasi.

691
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:19,409
You earned a total of 1.7 crores.

692
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:21,456
Will you take it through Hawala?
- Hawala?

693
00:47:22,245 --> 00:47:23,894
Yeah! I will go for it.

694
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:28,526
Send me a 10-rupee note on WhatsApp and
details of the person who goes to collect.

695
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:30,948
I will send Hawala details to you.

696
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:32,065
Yeah, okay.

697
00:47:37,136 --> 00:47:39,752
Amit Bhai! I sent you all the details.

698
00:47:39,785 --> 00:47:40,457
Okay...

699
00:47:41,347 --> 00:47:42,519
Where should I ask them to come?

700
00:47:42,683 --> 00:47:45,465
Ask them to come to Raj
jewelers near General Bazaar.

701
00:47:46,387 --> 00:47:47,597
Okay?
- Okay, Bhai.

702
00:48:11,144 --> 00:48:11,690
Boss.

703
00:48:11,761 --> 00:48:12,949
Murali! Where are you?

00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:15,932
I am nearby the room tell me..

705
00:48:16,012 --> 00:48:18,230
Haven’t you told me that
Shad Nagar account is 2 crores?

706
00:48:18,777 --> 00:48:21,035
He cannot wait until tomorrow
He is irritating me.

707
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:27,126
Do one thing
Give Hawala money to Shad Nagar client.

708
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,556
Do you get it?
- Okay, boss.

709
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,174
Why did he reject my call?

710
00:48:35,218 --> 00:48:36,673
Call the bookie now.

711
00:48:36,712 --> 00:48:38,150
Tell him that this guy
isn’t picking up the call.

712
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:47,578
Damn! He is also rejecting my call.

713
00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:49,531
What’s this twist?

714
00:48:49,906 --> 00:48:51,437
Call Bangarraju.

715
00:48:54,703 --> 00:48:56,226
Follow me, bro.
- Where?

716
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,492
Let’s go to Amith Bhai.

717
00:48:58,593 --> 00:48:59,171
Come.

718
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,446
Park your vehicle there.

719
00:49:37,712 --> 00:49:38,711
Hello, What?

720
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:40,227
Why did you call me so many times?

721
00:49:40,258 --> 00:49:41,930
Did the plan work?
- Everything is going good till now.

722
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:43,212
Where are you now?
- I will call you later.

723
00:50:16,352 --> 00:50:17,782
Behave normally.

724
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:19,259
Don’t look at him.

725
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,267
Take a U-turn…

726
00:51:09,876 --> 00:51:11,134
Go…

727
00:51:34,603 --> 00:51:36,290
Hey! He is approaching.
Go fast…

728
00:51:36,322 --> 00:51:37,118
Go fast, Madhu.

729
00:51:41,654 --> 00:51:43,670
Damn!
- We’re caught…

730
00:51:43,718 --> 00:51:45,179
Today is the end!

731
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:48,296
Hey! You keep quiet…
You go fast. Go!

732
00:51:55,577 --> 00:51:56,312
Fast…

733
00:52:18,346 --> 00:52:19,112
Fast…

734
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:20,635
Go!

735
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,367
Hit the brake.

736
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:26,938
Take a left turn.

737
00:52:39,936 --> 00:52:40,763
Go now.

738
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:46,076
Hey, James Bond! Haven’t
you got another number?

739
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:47,599
We just missed it.

740
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:49,654
Otherwise, you know
what might have happened. - Stop it.

741
00:52:49,795 --> 00:52:52,279
Nothing happened now
Stop that superstitious talk.

742
00:52:52,334 --> 00:52:53,740
You shut up.

743
00:52:53,857 --> 00:52:55,591
I told you that three
people shouldn’t go together.

744
00:52:55,616 --> 00:52:57,200
I also told you to stay back.

745
00:53:06,646 --> 00:53:08,497
Pick up the call
It might be something important.

746
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:10,060
Nothing much.

747
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:13,630
He cannot ask me to come
home. So, he might ask for the car.

748
00:53:14,396 --> 00:53:15,200
Okay.

749
00:53:15,256 --> 00:53:16,693
Go slow, We should go to the bank.

750
00:53:18,373 --> 00:53:19,349
Take a right.

751
00:53:24,045 --> 00:53:25,271
We are screwed!

752
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,209
F**k!

753
00:53:26,234 --> 00:53:27,325
What should we do now?

754
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,042
Where do you stay?

755
00:53:56,527 --> 00:53:58,269
Madhapur, sir!

756
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:19,268
Come and complain at the
station that you lost your bag.

757
00:54:30,577 --> 00:54:31,757
Damn…

758
00:54:34,335 --> 00:54:36,014
Kasi…

759
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,772
Shall we lodge a complaint?
- Go! Go and lodge a complaint.

760
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:41,741
Will you tell them that you
made money from cricket betting?

761
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:43,202
Fool!

762
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,514
Madhu! You go home.

763
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,499
Why just Madhu?
Let us all go home.

764
00:54:46,562 --> 00:54:47,366
Enough of all this crap!

765
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:49,624
Hey! Let us all go or stay together.

766
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,046
Madhu! Listen to me.

767
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:52,351
Your dad keeps calling.

768
00:54:52,413 --> 00:54:53,905
We’ll go in a cab and get the money.

769
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,209
You go home…

770
00:54:55,366 --> 00:54:56,327
Hey! No.

771
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:58,186
He didn’t harm us.

772
00:54:58,296 --> 00:54:59,163
We are lucky.

773
00:54:59,202 --> 00:55:01,202
Let it go because we got it for free.

774
00:55:01,249 --> 00:55:03,241
You know about my situation, don’t you?
Stop talking like that.

775
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:06,062
1.2 crores it is! How can
you give up so easily?

776
00:55:06,843 --> 00:55:08,389
Hey, Madhu! You go home.

777
00:55:08,437 --> 00:55:10,530
I will call you, You go home.
- Take care.

778
00:55:13,249 --> 00:55:16,359
Hey! Go buy a bag and
meet me at bank parking.

779
00:55:16,757 --> 00:55:18,264
I will go and make a call.
- Bag?

780
00:55:18,296 --> 00:55:20,163
You go.
- Why go to a bag at this hour?

781
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,272
Hey…

782
00:55:24,397 --> 00:55:27,163
Shucks! I forgot to take my phone.
- Do you really need that phone?

783
00:55:27,201 --> 00:55:28,576
Go and buy a bag.

784
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,358
Go.
- Let’s go together.

785
00:55:30,405 --> 00:55:31,530
Don’t irritate me.

786
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:33,554
Are you a kid?
Go and get a bag.

787
00:55:33,702 --> 00:55:34,905
Go!

788
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,165
Hello, Amit Bhai.

789
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:48,876
Did my client collect the cash?

790
00:55:48,915 --> 00:55:51,688
They came. But, I did not
give them the total amount.

791
00:55:51,899 --> 00:55:53,063
I gave them 50 lakhs.

792
00:55:53,368 --> 00:55:55,329
I asked them to collect
the rest from bank Venkat.

793
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:56,134
Okay, Bhai.

794
00:56:19,391 --> 00:56:21,704
she waited for you till now
and slept a few minutes ago.

795
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:52,283
Mr. Venkat! Where are you?

796
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:53,978
We will come in 5 minutes.
- Okay.

797
00:56:57,533 --> 00:56:58,915
Hey! Why so late?

798
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:01,760
You will know if you go
It is hard to get a bag at this hour.

799
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:04,244
Okay.
- Hasn’t he come yet?

800
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:11,611
Is that the guy?
- I don’t know.

801
00:57:15,549 --> 00:57:16,135
Hello, brother.

802
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:18,041
I have some work here
I will finish it and come to Osmania.

803
00:57:18,088 --> 00:57:19,353
Venkat?
- Are you Kasi?

804
00:57:19,408 --> 00:57:19,994
Yes.

805
00:57:21,096 --> 00:57:22,924
Today is Sunday. So,
cash collection got delayed.

806
00:57:23,525 --> 00:57:24,314
Give me the note.

807
00:57:38,346 --> 00:57:39,127
Take 50 lakhs now!

808
00:57:39,463 --> 00:57:41,291
70 lakhs on the way!

809
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,142
It is urgent
I have to go to a place far away.

810
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:43,963
Just a minute!

811
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:46,838
Where are you?
- We will be there in 30 minutes.

812
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:48,853
The client is waiting here. Why so late?

813
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:49,993
Come fast.

814
00:57:50,056 --> 00:57:51,423
It is okay,
We shall go there and collect it.

815
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:53,471
Wait a minute.

816
00:57:55,955 --> 00:57:57,189
Note down his number.
- Yeah.

817
00:57:57,275 --> 00:57:59,447
You can go to his place
and collect cash from him.

818
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:01,134
99491…

819
00:58:02,002 --> 00:58:03,314
69698!

820
00:58:04,831 --> 00:58:06,355
Okay, Thanks, brother...
Come, Let’s go.

821
00:58:41,669 --> 00:58:43,950
He collected cash at Rani Gunj.

822
00:58:44,512 --> 00:58:46,278
He stays at Madhapur.

823
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,770
What are they doing at Koti?

824
00:58:54,762 --> 00:58:55,520
Hello, sir.

825
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:58,255
Amit! Where are you?
- I am at the bazaar.

826
00:58:58,496 --> 00:58:59,754
How many did you do today?

827
00:58:59,895 --> 00:59:02,403
Today is Sunday, right?
We didn’t do much.

828
00:59:02,528 --> 00:59:04,168
But, we made one for a regular client.

829
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:05,012
How much?

830
00:59:05,294 --> 00:59:06,348
Sir! That is…

831
00:59:06,996 --> 00:59:09,481
No! I need some information
Tell me.

832
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:11,231
That’s 1.7 crores, sir.

833
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:14,200
Where did you give it?

834
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:15,793
I gave it at our regular place, sir.

835
00:59:16,794 --> 00:59:18,262
Did you give them 1.7 crores?

836
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:19,497
No, sir.

837
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:21,872
I couldn't adjust 1.7 crores.

838
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:24,831
I asked them to collect the
balance amount from Bank Venkat.

839
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:26,520
Send me bank Venkat’s number.

840
00:59:26,723 --> 00:59:27,684
How many people came?

841
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:29,558
Why, sir? What happened?

842
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,621
I will tell you later
You say.

843
00:59:32,184 --> 00:59:33,739
Two people came, sir.

844
00:59:34,598 --> 00:59:36,832
Send me their number.
- Okay, sir.

845
00:59:46,543 --> 00:59:48,473
Lakshmi! Take care of my mom
I am going out.

846
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,818
Why go to another place?
We should take it here.

847
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,248
What will you do if the cop comes back?

848
00:59:55,435 --> 00:59:56,873
Did you book a cab?
- I did.

849
00:59:58,185 --> 00:59:59,505
Hello, Is it Yedukondalu?
- Who is this?

850
00:59:59,537 --> 01:00:00,607
Venkat gave me your number.

851
01:00:00,857 --> 01:00:02,810
Come inside Gokul theatre near Erragadda.

852
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:03,998
Okay, I will be there.

853
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:11,943
Sir! What’s your destination?

854
01:00:12,006 --> 01:00:13,443
Take us to Gokul Theatre in Erragadda.
- Okay.

855
01:00:13,468 --> 01:00:14,209
Urgent, brother.

856
01:00:14,396 --> 01:00:15,475
Go fast.

857
01:00:54,691 --> 01:00:56,269
Wait for 10 minutes. We will come back.

858
01:00:56,294 --> 01:00:57,972
Where should I drop you, sir?
- Madhapur!

859
01:00:57,997 --> 01:00:58,753
Madhapur!

860
01:00:58,778 --> 01:01:00,543
Sir! Please come fast.
- Yeah.

861
01:01:11,689 --> 01:01:12,533
Are you Yedukondalu?

862
01:01:12,845 --> 01:01:13,455
Yes.

863
01:01:13,494 --> 01:01:14,736
Venkat called me.

864
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:16,158
How much?

865
01:01:16,314 --> 01:01:17,220
70, right?

866
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:19,946
Give me the note.

867
01:01:20,156 --> 01:01:20,703
Yeah.

868
01:01:26,711 --> 01:01:28,148
Hey! Do you have it?

869
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:30,218
Why would I have it?
- What happened?

870
01:01:30,572 --> 01:01:32,197
I cannot find the note.

871
01:01:32,252 --> 01:01:34,869
I cannot give it if you
don't have the note.

872
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:37,478
Venkat called you, right?

873
01:01:37,955 --> 01:01:39,260
I cannot give you without seeing the note.

874
01:01:39,392 --> 01:01:40,790
We showed it to Venkat.

875
01:01:40,815 --> 01:01:41,955
I already told you, right?
I can’t give you.

876
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:46,510
You must have forgotten
to take it back from Venkat.

877
01:01:46,642 --> 01:01:48,493
Okay. Will you stay here?
- I will stay here.

878
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:50,611
Let’s go.
- Do not go, Please.

879
01:01:52,353 --> 01:01:54,392
Hey! I guess you forgot
to take it from Venkat.

880
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:58,502
Bro! Go fast.

881
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,486
We should go to Osmania hospital.
- What happened?

882
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:02,775
I forgot to take my bag
I have to take it.

883
01:02:02,814 --> 01:02:04,079
Otherwise, they might leave.
- Okay.

884
01:02:04,455 --> 01:02:05,205
Go fast.

885
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:12,416
Hello.

886
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:13,806
Why do you take so
long to pick up the call?

887
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:15,212
Who are you?
- I am CI Ajay.

888
01:02:15,252 --> 01:02:17,338
Sir! I am sorry.
I did not check the number.

889
01:02:17,447 --> 01:02:19,517
Did you give money to Amit’s client?

890
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:20,689
I gave it, sir
What happened?

891
01:02:20,751 --> 01:02:21,509
How much did you give?

892
01:02:21,549 --> 01:02:22,603
I gave him 50 lakhs.

893
01:02:22,628 --> 01:02:23,931
I asked him to wait for
the remaining amount.

894
01:02:23,956 --> 01:02:25,275
But, they went to collect the amount.

895
01:02:25,314 --> 01:02:26,384
Where would they collect it?

896
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,120
In a theatre!

897
01:02:27,431 --> 01:02:28,439
What theatre?

898
01:02:28,464 --> 01:02:29,939
Gokul theatre at Erragadda, sir.

899
01:02:34,603 --> 01:02:36,213
They’re annoying me.

900
01:02:41,056 --> 01:02:42,736
Crap! He turned off his phone.

901
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:44,533
How can you be sure that he’d be there?

902
01:02:44,634 --> 01:02:45,892
He must have left already.

903
01:02:46,017 --> 01:02:47,385
Do we have another option?

904
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:49,478
Why do you irritate me without
thinking about a solution?

905
01:02:50,135 --> 01:02:51,634
You forgot it. How can you blame me?

906
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:53,236
Shut up, You go.

907
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:54,806
Why blame me for everything?

908
01:03:00,283 --> 01:03:01,314
Damn it!

909
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:05,486
Who could it be?

910
01:03:06,135 --> 01:03:07,439
How would I know?

911
01:03:07,806 --> 01:03:09,728
No one has this number
But, they are calling.

912
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:10,947
I am getting calls
What should I do?

913
01:03:11,494 --> 01:03:12,424
Damn it!

914
01:03:17,174 --> 01:03:18,471
Hey! Stop…

915
01:03:23,189 --> 01:03:24,845
Hey, bag.
- Shucks.

916
01:03:24,892 --> 01:03:26,697
Why don’t you pick up my
call? I called you many times.

917
01:03:26,722 --> 01:03:28,706
What phone?
- Check your call log.

918
01:03:30,744 --> 01:03:32,978
Brother! I forgot the 10-rupee note.

919
01:03:33,033 --> 01:03:35,290
That guy doesn’t give me
money unless I show him the note.

920
01:03:35,322 --> 01:03:37,470
What 10-rupee note are you talking about?
- Check it once, brother.

921
01:03:37,502 --> 01:03:38,947
What 10-rupee note are
you talking about, brother?

922
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:41,369
I want to buy a water
bottle. Give me money, sir.

923
01:03:45,275 --> 01:03:47,275
All I have is 2000 rupees,
500 rupees, and 100 rupees.

924
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,150
Check it.

925
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,978
Brother! Give me one water bottle.

926
01:04:01,846 --> 01:04:03,322
There is no 10-rupee note.

927
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:05,056
I already told you that I do not have it.

928
01:04:05,103 --> 01:04:06,962
Okay. Think about it once.

929
01:04:07,158 --> 01:04:09,510
Where did you go after meeting us, brother?

930
01:04:09,689 --> 01:04:13,392
I went to Osmania and then I
came here and bought a cigarette.

931
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:14,853
Did you take a cigarette?

932
01:04:15,236 --> 01:04:16,431
Hey…what do you want?

933
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:17,510
I need 10-rupee notes.

934
01:04:17,556 --> 01:04:18,572
I want crores.

935
01:04:18,627 --> 01:04:20,744
I will give you 1000 rupees per note.

936
01:04:20,806 --> 01:04:23,221
What? Movie vouchers?
Damn! Take this.

937
01:04:30,728 --> 01:04:32,721
What is it, brother?
Did you win a lottery with a 10-rupee note?

938
01:04:32,746 --> 01:04:35,174
I gave you 1000 rupees because I don’t
want you to ask such stupid questions.

939
01:04:37,205 --> 01:04:38,619
Sir! Take the change.

940
01:04:45,392 --> 01:04:46,885
Sir! Take the change.

941
01:04:47,064 --> 01:04:48,447
Oh! Give me back my money then.

942
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,244
There is no 10-rupee note, brother.

943
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:52,808
I did not take it, brother.

944
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:55,064
Hey…Stop, man.
- Check it…

945
01:04:55,134 --> 01:04:57,650
Hey, Kasi I did not take it.
- Check it again, It is very important.

946
01:04:57,721 --> 01:04:59,627
Check it, brother
What’s this nuisance?

947
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:01,166
10 rupees!

948
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:05,720
Where did you get it?

949
01:05:05,745 --> 01:05:07,431
I gave 100 rupees to the cab
driver to buy a water bottle.

950
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:08,447
He gave me the change and I found it.

951
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:11,627
Okay. Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

952
01:05:13,853 --> 01:05:15,775
Bro! Start the vehicle.
- Okay, sir…

953
01:05:21,705 --> 01:05:22,510
F**k!

954
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:29,916
Brother! Stop here.

955
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:34,955
Hey! You stay here
I will get it.

956
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,728
Brother!

957
01:05:44,908 --> 01:05:46,635
Did you forget there?
- Yes, brother.

958
01:05:49,785 --> 01:05:50,496
F**k!

959
01:05:57,105 --> 01:05:57,886
Thanks, brother.

960
01:05:57,965 --> 01:05:58,715
Okay.

961
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:07,808
Hello.

962
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:08,925
Hello.

963
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:10,394
Did Venkat’s client come?

964
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:11,441
Greetings, sir.

965
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,394
Where are you?
- I am in the theatre, Where are you?

966
01:06:13,419 --> 01:06:14,761
I am up here on the balcony, sir.

967
01:06:23,918 --> 01:06:25,323
Where is that Hawala client?

968
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:27,449
He took the money just now, sir.

969
01:07:06,697 --> 01:07:08,017
Sir! There is a thief in your house.

970
01:07:08,072 --> 01:07:09,626
What?
- Your mother is terrified.

971
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:10,994
Please come home soon, sir.

972
01:07:22,026 --> 01:07:24,448
Don’t worry about the 50 lakhs we lost.

973
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:26,578
We got this amount at least.

974
01:07:29,274 --> 01:07:30,829
Everything happens for a reason.

975
01:07:31,203 --> 01:07:33,110
What if Amit had given the entire amount?

976
01:07:33,306 --> 01:07:35,188
Why would we go to Koti if
he gives the total amount?

977
01:07:35,213 --> 01:07:36,469
We would go to Madhapur.

978
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:38,524
We shouldn’t have lost it.

979
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:40,149
Crap! I worked hard to earn it.

980
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,423
Crap! I worked hard to earn it.

981
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:47,536
Tell me, dude.
- Someone got 5 lakhs in cricket betting.

982
01:07:47,584 --> 01:07:49,904
He is hosting a party in Forest pub
Come there.

983
01:07:50,045 --> 01:07:51,834
That is not Forest
It is Prost.

984
01:07:52,051 --> 01:07:53,574
Why is he giving a party?

985
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:55,426
He should save that money, right?

986
01:07:55,527 --> 01:07:57,707
Stop talking like that, dude.

987
01:07:57,746 --> 01:07:59,387
Stop talking like that, dude.

988
01:07:59,449 --> 01:08:02,738
I bought a Honda City car by playing MPL.

989
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:05,488
I became an Uber driver
after playing another MPL.

990
01:08:05,527 --> 01:08:08,722
Don’t you know about my downfall?

991
01:08:08,746 --> 01:08:10,231
Will you come or not?

992
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,449
Why will I not come when
I can get free alcohol?

993
01:08:12,474 --> 01:08:14,389
I will come, I have to drop someone.

994
01:08:14,444 --> 01:08:15,537
I will drop them and come.

995
01:08:15,562 --> 01:08:17,593
I guess he has good
experience with betting.

996
01:08:17,618 --> 01:08:19,228
Come on, sir. Stop teasing me.

997
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,091
Hey! Check the speed breaker.

998
01:08:22,772 --> 01:08:23,857
Damn you!

999
01:08:23,936 --> 01:08:26,526
Who the hell is he?
- Hey, dicky!

1000
01:08:28,467 --> 01:08:30,459
Hey idiot, Watch while you drive.

1001
01:08:30,484 --> 01:08:32,756
Blind fellow! Why did you
hit the brake suddenly?

1002
01:08:32,787 --> 01:08:34,608
I drive just like you.
- Will you simply hit me then?

1003
01:08:34,639 --> 01:08:36,654
You hit the brake suddenly?
Why are you shouting?

1004
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:38,763
I will hit the brake, That is my wish
Will you hit me for that?

1005
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:41,670
Stop talking like that
This road does not belong to you.

1006
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:44,214
Yes! This road belongs to me.
- Hey! Watch your words.

1007
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,771
Hey take that rod.
- If you give me respect, I will give you.

1008
01:08:46,811 --> 01:08:49,513
You are talking too much. Not me.
- Hey, Kasi, Police!

1009
01:08:49,561 --> 01:08:53,607
I will make you pay the entire amount.
- I will also make you pay.

1010
01:08:53,639 --> 01:08:56,006
Hey! Get lost.
- What’s this nuisance?

1011
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:59,045
Sir! The entire road is empty
He hit my car from behind.

1012
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:01,334
The road is empty
But, he suddenly hit the brake.

1013
01:09:01,404 --> 01:09:04,427
Will he crash if I hit the brake?
My car is damaged.

1014
01:09:04,498 --> 01:09:06,076
Hey! It is your mistake.

1015
01:09:06,498 --> 01:09:09,100
Hey! This won’t end here
come to station.

1016
01:09:09,215 --> 01:09:10,925
Hey! Get in the vehicle.

1017
01:09:10,998 --> 01:09:12,123
I will file a case on you.

1018
01:09:12,264 --> 01:09:13,326
Who are you?

1019
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,115
We are just passengers.
- Hey! Get in the vehicle.

1020
01:09:28,493 --> 01:09:29,345
Son!

1021
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:31,438
Don’t worry, mom
I will take care.

1022
01:09:31,548 --> 01:09:34,055
You go and sleep.

1023
01:09:34,532 --> 01:09:36,189
Take care of my mom.
- Okay, sir.

1024
01:09:51,124 --> 01:09:53,382
Hey, Santosh! Where are you?
- I am patrolling, sir.

1025
01:09:53,663 --> 01:09:54,280
What happened?

1026
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:56,101
Go to the control room immediately.

1027
01:09:56,132 --> 01:09:58,694
Get 2 hour-CCTV footage of the
road near my house to the station.

1028
01:09:58,719 --> 01:09:59,382
Okay?
- Okay, sir.

1029
01:10:26,638 --> 01:10:28,161
What the heck is happening with us?

1030
01:10:33,232 --> 01:10:34,372
Hey! Where are you?

1031
01:10:34,544 --> 01:10:35,520
We are at the police station.

1032
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:36,787
Police station?
What happened?

1033
01:10:36,825 --> 01:10:37,755
What should I say?

1034
01:10:38,214 --> 01:10:40,886
The second guy did have the full amount
So, he sent me to the third guy.

1035
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:44,012
I went there to collect the money
and a vehicle crashed into ours.

1036
01:10:44,137 --> 01:10:45,801
Was it an accident?
Did something happen to you?

1037
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,309
We are fine.
- Are you still at the station?

1038
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:50,895
My phone is dead.

1039
01:10:51,473 --> 01:10:52,051
Damn!

1040
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:54,836
Sir! How will you go?

1041
01:10:55,094 --> 01:10:56,407
We will manage.

1042
01:10:56,508 --> 01:10:57,829
Take 2000 rupees.
- No, sir.

1043
01:10:57,854 --> 01:10:58,962
It is okay. Take it.

1044
01:11:01,016 --> 01:11:04,165
Actually, we left our bag in the car.

1045
01:11:04,313 --> 01:11:05,454
What’s in the bag, sir?

1046
01:11:05,524 --> 01:11:07,602
Clothes!
- Clothes!

1047
01:11:07,923 --> 01:11:10,204
They filed a case
I cannot open that now.

1048
01:11:10,446 --> 01:11:13,024
How should I explain it to you?
- Shall we talk to the constable once?

1049
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,531
Sir! They are…
- Hey!

1050
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:17,024
It is okay
We will take it tomorrow.

1051
01:11:17,049 --> 01:11:19,094
Okay.
- I will call you.

1052
01:11:21,383 --> 01:11:22,860
Hey! Why did you tell him
that you’d take it tomorrow?

1053
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:24,070
You fool! Come with me.

1054
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:27,352
Will you tell that constable
and give him a share?

1055
01:11:27,377 --> 01:11:28,736
Oh! I understood.

1056
01:11:30,015 --> 01:11:32,484
Hey, Kasi! What shall we do now?

1057
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:34,305
Let’s wait here.

1058
01:11:34,751 --> 01:11:37,540
We shall take our bag and
leave when nobody is watching.

1059
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,477
How can you think about
looting in a police station?

1060
01:11:40,508 --> 01:11:41,376
Stop joking.

1061
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:43,454
Do you think I’d joke in this situation?

1062
01:11:44,821 --> 01:11:46,141
A lot has happened already.

1063
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:48,391
That cop let us go
because of money earlier.

1064
01:11:48,524 --> 01:11:51,461
If he comes back, we’d be finished.

1065
01:11:51,508 --> 01:11:53,212
He will imprison us.
- Stop it.

1066
01:11:53,415 --> 01:11:54,430
Why do you always talk negatively?

1067
01:11:54,455 --> 01:11:56,822
You have been saying that
nothing happens in our favor.

1068
01:11:59,126 --> 01:12:00,469
You never listen to me.

1069
01:12:01,001 --> 01:12:04,180
You wouldn’t have been in this situation if you
had found a job after completing your degree.

1070
01:12:04,618 --> 01:12:07,399
You planned to go to America
Now, we are at the police station.

1071
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,117
Let’s think about the money tomorrow.

1072
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:12,022
Listen to me
Let’s go away from here.

1073
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:12,967
You go.

1074
01:12:13,467 --> 01:12:14,350
I won’t come. Just leave.

1075
01:12:15,889 --> 01:12:16,467
Okay.

1076
01:12:16,764 --> 01:12:17,827
Do whatever you want.

1077
01:12:27,788 --> 01:12:30,327
Hey! You said you would go, right?
Why did you come back?

1078
01:12:31,342 --> 01:12:33,569
We’ve come this far
How can I leave you and go?

1079
01:12:33,928 --> 01:12:35,670
Let’s do it together.

1080
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:37,897
Okay. Come.

1081
01:12:55,905 --> 01:12:57,623
Hey! How will you open it?

1082
01:12:58,888 --> 01:13:00,685
Come. Let’s try hard.

1083
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,342
Hey, wait.

1084
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:05,483
Let's try it from the inside.

1085
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:09,915
What’s this?
Why is the door open?

1086
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:19,446
Hey! There is no bag here.

1087
01:13:19,555 --> 01:13:20,712
What? There is no bag in there?

1088
01:13:28,516 --> 01:13:29,790
It is not inside.
- What?

1089
01:13:34,212 --> 01:13:35,259
Damn it!

1090
01:13:35,563 --> 01:13:38,406
We watched him park here, right?
Where is the bag?

1091
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:28,958
Come and complain at the
station that you lost your bag.

1092
01:14:47,063 --> 01:14:48,610
Send me bank Venkat’s number.

1093
01:14:48,696 --> 01:14:49,595
How many people came?

1094
01:14:50,548 --> 01:14:52,556
Lakshmi! Take care of my mom
I am going out.

1095
01:15:18,959 --> 01:15:19,513
Hello.

1096
01:15:19,592 --> 01:15:21,506
Did Venkat’s client collect the money?

1097
01:15:21,577 --> 01:15:23,467
Yeah! They came and took the money.

1098
01:17:18,569 --> 01:17:19,772
Where have you been?

1099
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:21,553
Your mobile is turned off.

1100
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:23,819
Okay. Come down.

1101
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,140
Sir! This is it.

1102
01:17:41,798 --> 01:17:43,001
Did you find his details?

1103
01:17:44,907 --> 01:17:46,337
You have to check another footage, sir.

1104
01:17:47,657 --> 01:17:49,782
What should I do now?
- Do not worry.

1105
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:51,789
Everything will be okay.
- How will everything be okay?

1106
01:17:52,587 --> 01:17:54,345
You guys always get stupid ideas.

1107
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:55,266
Damn it.

1108
01:17:56,462 --> 01:17:58,469
You spoiled him from the beginning.

1109
01:17:59,673 --> 01:18:00,693
What’s that dent?

1110
01:18:01,514 --> 01:18:03,467
What happened?
- Your mobile is turned off.

1111
01:18:03,499 --> 01:18:04,803
I didn’t know what to do.

1112
01:18:04,866 --> 01:18:07,131
I came to pick you at the police station.

1113
01:18:07,156 --> 01:18:08,162
This happened on the way.

1114
01:18:15,598 --> 01:18:16,106
Hello.

1115
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:02,681
Zoom the number plate.

1116
01:19:02,915 --> 01:19:03,563
Zoom it.

1117
01:19:03,634 --> 01:19:04,892
That is your car number, sir.

1118
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:40,119
Madhu!

1119
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:42,869
Didn’t I tell you that
I am lucky for you? - Madhu!

1120
01:19:47,861 --> 01:19:48,525
F**k!

1121
01:19:49,244 --> 01:19:50,697
Your problem is solved.
