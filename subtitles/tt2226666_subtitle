But how long you will remove
these clothes

00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,315
How long you will change house
and these rooms

40

You earn daily and spend daily

41
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,723
You don't care for your future

42
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,424
Every body have an expiry date

43
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,337

59
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:41,977
We leave tomorrow!

60
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,017
Welcome to Srilanka!

Our lntelligence Department call
us Agency

66
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:16,113
Actully we are a part of our
Country lntelligence Network

67
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,538
A Secret Cell!

68
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,246
l am the head of that cell....
You know.....

69
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,881
Without the moustache ofcourse

70
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,618
And he....

71
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,787
is the important member of
my private army

72
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,283
Come!
Sit!

73
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,699
You can also say....

74
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,237
that our agency is not official

75
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,539
We are patriot

76
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,369
We protect the country

77
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,235
from our own way

78
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,681
l am sure you want to know that

79
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,653
in this mission which role
you are playing?

80
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,798
Do you recognize this man?

81
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,429
Kabir!

82
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,868
Kabir Wilson!

83
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,736
He is not a normal gangster

84
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,346
He is an assassin

85
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,319
He has killed 36 famous people
of our country

86
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,218
Directly or lndirectly

87
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,585
Police Officers!

88
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,113
lntelligence Officials

89
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,558
Government Servants!

90
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,594
ln fact our elected representatives
has assassinated from him

91
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,128
Like an artist creates his art

92
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,371
Same as that Kabir reached to
his destiny

93
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:47,734
from that same way

94
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,400
with his sleeper cell network help

95
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,514
Who is surrounding in this country
like our network

96
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,010
Behind many terrorist attacks
in our country

97
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,276
Kabir has used his mind

98
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,693
You don't know....

99
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,553
But Kabir was an honest police
officer like us

100
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,627
Then one day he pretext
for a case

101
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,302
and he got disappeared

102
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,140
According to our information now
he is turning insane

103
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,614
He believes himself a messiah

104
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,178
He believes that whatever
he is doing

105
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,686
he is doing for nation's goodness

106
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,192
And anyone could be his
next target

107
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,495
lf this man is really dangerous then
why did you spare him alive

108
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,496
Why don't you kill him?
No!

109
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,694
That's not our objective

110
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,731
Norjust him!

111
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,104
We have to destroy his
entire network

112
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,907
Besides we need information

113
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,971
lnformation of those people who
are working in that network

114
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,874
All these information details

115
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,918
are in his ordinary laptop

116
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,456
But what do you want from me?

117
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,985
You guys can do this job

118
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,397
Then why do you need me?

119
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,091
We need you

120
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,426
Nobody resist near Kabir

121
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,029
nor anybody can survive

122
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,334
Except!

123
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,668
him!
Sumit!

124
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,038
His best friend who protects him

125
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,050
lt's only you who can go
close to Kabir

126
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,046
You can reach to his bedroom

127
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,353
Without any doubts

128
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,859
You will have to do all
those things

129
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,623
and you will have to get
that data

130
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,963
lzna is not trained for these
kind of missions

131
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,764
Kabir will be suspicious on her

132
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,318
That's why l have chosen her

133
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,187
lzna is non other but

134
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,456
She was his passion

135
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,459
Before his disappearance

136
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,128
they had a serious affair

137
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,805
ln fact lzna was the biggest
weakness of Kabir

138
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:38,705
And she still is...

139
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,407
After her not another girl
came to his life

140
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,248
A psychactrist told me this thing

141
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,360
to whom Kabir went for his
treatment

142
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,725
Doctor told me that how
during treatment

143
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,756
Kabir was just

144
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,434
talking about lzna

145
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,435
Only lzna was on his mind
and heart

146
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,438
nobody else.....

147
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,371
Now we didn't gave you 10 crore
for nothing

148
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,007
We are not so fool

149
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,456
A person couldn't loyal
to his country

150
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,320
He became a loyal to his body

151
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,568
According to our information

152
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,971
Kabir made his hide out in an
exotic area of this city

153
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,533
Before his disappearance

154
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,071
we will have to do this job

155
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,348
Because in which house he
is gonna live

156
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,244
You two will live in the opposite
house of that house

157
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,253
Will you work for us?

158
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,560
What will you let me do?

159
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:05,857
l didn't know....

160
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,199
l need time to think...
Please!

161
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,269
l will give evening to think

162
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,978
lzna! you should take decision
in senses

163
00:16:58,951 --> 00:16:59,975
What should l decide?

164
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,751
for who?

165
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,814
l heard his name

166
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,650
l saw his voice

167
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,025
and my wounds become fresh

168
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,153
Six Years!

169
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:14,790
l was mourning six years for
that person....

170
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,594
l found out he didn't deserve
for that mourne

171
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,131
He was alive!

172
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,467
He was killing people

173
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,007
And l.....

174
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,477
l was crying to missing him

175
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,207
And now.....

176
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,008
l will have to go to him

177
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,713
l will have to pretend

178
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,298
l did!

179
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,043
lt was my thirst to love him

180
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,247
with whom my thirst was over

181
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,819
He was my seashore

182
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,087
whose every wave become restless
and came to me

183
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,328
And this body....

184
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,364
drunk those waves like a warm sand

185
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,370
l wish he would never met me

186
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,257
How much?
58!

187
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,880
lmran!

drug carter

194

as a bribe

216
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,743
lf you will do something wrong again

217
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,420

what l saw in that night's darkness

221
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,989

but he will be mine till every birth

225
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:57,826
Not anyone else

226
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,576
You wanna die?

227
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,220

You will have to pretend to shock
when you saw him

251
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,349
Otherwise he will be doubt on you

252
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,354

00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,990
He was Kabir Wilson or we became a
neighbour of some wrong person

262
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,895
He is not that Kabir

263
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,170
Whom l knew....

264
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,470
Something is changed

265
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,576

00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,635
A man and a woman has been
shifted to my neighbour

267
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,370
l knew the woman find out who
is that man?

268
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:39,681
He might not be that person
what l am thinking

269
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,216
Beer on tea time

270
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,362

l was thinking about him

273
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,604
How he was looking at me

274
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,004
l didn't find out that he was
pretending to forgot me

275
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,045
Or he really forgot me

276
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,177
We have to do something

277
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,854
Otherwise this mission will be over
before it starts

278
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:10,991
l have an idea

279
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,023
Leave me alone for a while

280
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,098
To see me alone he might
be come to me

281
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,039
After all he is a man

282
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,268
What happen?

283
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:11,867
He came at the door

284
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:13,607
Then he got a phone call

285
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,738
and he is gone somewhere

286
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:45,553
l am your sinner

287
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,260
l am a coward

288
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,736
Love was on my front

289
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:57,800
and l was escaping from that

290
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,407
Why do we lost those thing

291
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,315
when we realize their values
after losing them

292
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:16,915
But still l want you to take
in my arms

293
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,795
l won't never let you go

294
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:23,866
But what should l do?

295
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:30,469
l have many sorrows except love

296
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:40,648
You don't know that l am in a
deep shit of crime

297
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,214
You won't take me out

298
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,013
l won't came out

299
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:55,625
lt was my problem to leave you
without informing you

300
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,697
But right now my heart says that

301
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,006
You leave the entire world and
leave that man

302
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:06,868
and come to me

303
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,377
But l won't say that

304
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:20,087
l have no right to bother you and
your poor fiancee

305
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:32,726
lt was decided that we have to
meet for the last time

306
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,201
And now l want to leave

307
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,532
you in your world

308
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:41,475
where there is love

309
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:43,345
there is peace

310
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,880
and not my shadow

311
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,417
No!

312
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,183
lt's not in my reach

313
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,597
l can't marry with someone else

314
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,534
l will leave everything for you

315
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,836
l want your love back again

316
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,279
Don't let me go to someone else

317
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,051
Please stop me!

318
01:03:36,151 --> 01:03:37,948
l have told you to keep him stay

319
01:03:39,454 --> 01:03:41,388
l would have died because of you

320
01:03:42,224 --> 01:03:43,486
That's all you wanted

321
01:03:44,593 --> 01:03:46,618
l found out that was a fake date

322
01:03:46,928 --> 01:03:48,793
He has hidden real data
somewhere else

323
01:03:50,966 --> 01:03:53,696
Before he suspicious on us you will
have to find that data

324
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,004
What's wrong with you?

325
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,982
What happen to you?

326
01:04:22,764 --> 01:04:23,992
Your fiancee

327
01:04:26,134 --> 01:04:27,465
Where did you meet him first time

328
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:29,664
ln Dehli!

329
01:04:30,439 --> 01:04:31,463
4 years earlier

330
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:33,965
l was doing a play in theatre

331
01:04:35,043 --> 01:04:35,668
Why?

332
01:04:40,182 --> 01:04:41,376
You are lying

333
01:04:43,485 --> 01:04:45,282
You have memorised all the answers

334
01:04:46,088 --> 01:04:46,952
What do you mean?

335
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:49,815
Those people send you to me

336
01:04:49,991 --> 01:04:51,390
Who people?
What is this nonsense?

337
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:53,923
Don't be dramatic,
l am not doing any drama

338
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:56,686
You are doing drama

339
01:04:57,699 --> 01:05:01,897
Your lover is an intelligence officer
who is pretending to being your fiancee

340
01:05:02,604 --> 01:05:04,401
Yes or no
No!

341
01:05:05,006 --> 01:05:06,405
He is my fiancee

342
01:05:07,209 --> 01:05:08,403
His name is Karan

343
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:10,640
He is a representative of Devi Hotels

344
01:05:10,812 --> 01:05:13,645
He is not any intelligence officer

345
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,349
10 Seconds

346
01:05:16,985 --> 01:05:18,748
You have 10 seconds to tell
the truth

347
01:05:19,621 --> 01:05:20,713
lf you won't tell the truth

348
01:05:21,756 --> 01:05:24,452
then l will pull the trigger and
finish this story

349
01:05:25,026 --> 01:05:26,687
What is this madness?
One!

350
01:05:27,629 --> 01:05:29,119
What's wrong with you?
Two!

351
01:05:29,397 --> 01:05:30,921
Why you are thinking like that?
Three!

352
01:05:31,266 --> 01:05:33,029
Kabir! Don't!
Four!

353
01:05:33,368 --> 01:05:34,528
Think again!
Five!

354
01:05:35,837 --> 01:05:38,567
Your doubt will ruin both of us,
Six! Seven!

355
01:05:39,141 --> 01:05:40,472
Kabir Don't!
Eight!

356
01:05:41,109 --> 01:05:42,269
No!
Nine!

357
01:05:42,844 --> 01:05:44,709
No!
Ten!

358
01:05:46,615 --> 01:05:47,639
l am sorry!

359
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:55,986
l didn't have another choice.
l must have to testify you

360
01:05:58,393 --> 01:05:59,325
You have said!

361
01:05:59,861 --> 01:06:02,022
that you are made for me

362
01:06:03,398 --> 01:06:04,990
You can't marry with someone else

363
01:06:08,303 --> 01:06:09,292
Leave him!

364
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,040
Don't go back to him!

365
01:06:16,311 --> 01:06:17,573
Leave your world

366
01:06:19,314 --> 01:06:20,975
l will leave everything for you

367
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:24,616
Marry me!

368
01:06:29,424 --> 01:06:32,552
So matter has come to marriage

369
01:06:34,196 --> 01:06:35,720
Now if you will say yes then
you will be in trouble

370
01:06:37,532 --> 01:06:38,464
and if you will say no

371
01:06:39,501 --> 01:06:40,695
then we all will be in trouble

372
01:06:41,703 --> 01:06:42,897
Entire game will be over

373
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:46,666
But that's also truth

374
01:06:49,377 --> 01:06:51,368
that a lover couldn't do a job

375
01:06:52,681 --> 01:06:54,410
only a wife can do thatjob

376
01:06:57,652 --> 01:06:58,482
What do you think?

377
01:06:59,487 --> 01:07:01,648
Will you marry with Kabir?
What is this question?

378
01:07:04,492 --> 01:07:07,859
you think that Kabir will quit his
business because of this love story

379
01:07:08,797 --> 01:07:09,786
He will be reformed

380
01:07:10,732 --> 01:07:12,199
lt's impossible!
Karan!

381
01:07:14,469 --> 01:07:15,595
l understand everything

382
01:07:16,972 --> 01:07:17,961
l am not so fool

383
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:22,669
Kabir proposed lzna so he
could find out

384
01:07:22,944 --> 01:07:24,411
that either she works for us or not

385
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,309
And our objective is to trap him

386
01:07:27,816 --> 01:07:29,613
Who cares?
By hook or by crook!

387
01:07:30,418 --> 01:07:31,646
lzna won't marry with Kabir

388
01:07:33,255 --> 01:07:35,246
Kabir is already aware about our plan

389
01:07:35,523 --> 01:07:37,491
That's why he proposed her

390
01:07:38,493 --> 01:07:40,859
After marriage he will take
our all information

391
01:07:41,296 --> 01:07:43,821
He will get the truth from her and
then he will kill her

392
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:46,099
And l am sorry to say this....

393
01:07:46,434 --> 01:07:49,562
We can't recover 10 crores to take
lzna's life

394
01:07:50,905 --> 01:07:51,599
Stop it!

395
01:07:54,109 --> 01:07:56,805
l am doing every effort to send
this girl into that house

396
01:07:58,046 --> 01:07:59,343
and you want to stay her out

397
01:08:01,383 --> 01:08:04,682
Officer like you will forgot his duty

398
01:08:08,456 --> 01:08:09,753
Don't interfere this job

399
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:15,290
To see men become out of control

400
01:08:15,897 --> 01:08:17,364
will be your daily routine

401
01:08:18,767 --> 01:08:20,291
But don't listen to him

402
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:22,559
He forgot that he is an officer

403
01:08:23,805 --> 01:08:24,567
Not a lover

404
01:08:26,775 --> 01:08:30,267
Will you marry with Kabir?

405
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:33,740
Yes!

406
01:08:37,752 --> 01:08:40,880
Earlier l wanted to settle my previous
account with Kabir

407
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:46,017
But when he put gun on my head

408
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:49,990
Something is changed

409
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,065
This is notjust your mission

410
01:08:54,636 --> 01:08:55,534
Mine too!

411
01:08:56,037 --> 01:08:57,368
And l will take the risk

412
01:08:57,972 --> 01:08:59,667
l will commit this marriage

413
01:09:31,773 --> 01:09:33,070
l know what are you doing?

414
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,301
you can fool everyone but not me

415
01:09:40,248 --> 01:09:41,340
you are not sacrifying your life

416
01:09:45,687 --> 01:09:47,211
You are going against us

417
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:50,458
l know your plan

418
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:52,489
l know what do you want?

419
01:09:52,894 --> 01:09:54,327
After marrying with that criminal

420
01:09:54,596 --> 01:09:57,190
after sleeping with him

421
01:09:57,565 --> 01:09:58,725
you will betray everyone

422
01:09:59,634 --> 01:10:00,566
even me too....

423
01:10:03,338 --> 01:10:03,997
Everything is a drama

424
01:10:08,009 --> 01:10:10,773
What you are doing hatred drama

425
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:12,739
Everything will turned to love

426
01:10:13,148 --> 01:10:14,274
When he will hug you

427
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:15,638
When he will kiss you

428
01:10:15,817 --> 01:10:17,045
Because you still love him

429
01:10:22,524 --> 01:10:25,550
l am talking to you,
Lower your voice

430
01:10:26,494 --> 01:10:27,756
What happened to you?

431
01:10:28,463 --> 01:10:30,021
You are shouting like mad

432
01:10:30,532 --> 01:10:31,294
What do you want?

433
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:33,795
That Kabir listen to you

434
01:10:34,269 --> 01:10:35,429
and he should kill all of us today

435
01:10:38,373 --> 01:10:41,308
l will call Mr.Guru and tell
him everything

436
01:11:08,403 --> 01:11:10,200
l should not behave like this

437
01:11:26,788 --> 01:11:28,483
Today what you have decide

438
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:32,152
You broke my heart

439
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,056
l am feeling very jealous

440
01:11:39,734 --> 01:11:40,792
And from that moment

441
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:42,700
what you will spend with him

442
01:11:46,241 --> 01:11:48,368
l want to chop him in pieces

443
01:11:48,543 --> 01:11:50,670
that nothing will remain in
your heart and mind

444
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,204
But l can't.....

445
01:12:01,422 --> 01:12:02,855
You have ruined me

446
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:29,619
You stop following me silently

447
01:25:30,764 --> 01:25:31,856
lf l would shoot you then....

448
01:25:44,111 --> 01:25:44,873
l like old songs

449
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:50,710
We all are own past

450
01:25:54,154 --> 01:25:55,121
Past!

451
01:25:58,125 --> 01:25:59,990
Do you believe it?
Yes l do!

452
01:26:02,596 --> 01:26:04,325
That's why it reminds me that night

453
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:07,497
When l came to your house
first time

454
01:26:08,836 --> 01:26:11,600
l was waiting for you on staircase
in that dark

455
01:26:13,207 --> 01:26:14,572
You were shocked like this

456
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:17,702
You were about to shoot me

457
01:26:19,747 --> 01:26:21,180
That might be good

458
01:26:22,683 --> 01:26:25,846
At least this heart would be save
to for being restless

459
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:29,450
Those were the nice days

460
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:33,351
Those were the most nice moments
of my life

461
01:26:35,462 --> 01:26:37,589
They all are lost,
No!

462
01:26:43,504 --> 01:26:44,835
Days will come now

463
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:49,365
Moments will be spend now

464
01:26:51,879 --> 01:26:55,042
Moments what we just imagined

465
01:26:57,317 --> 01:26:58,215
but we didn't live them

466
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:03,988
Do you know?

467
01:27:05,192 --> 01:27:08,787
Which thing kept me attached with life

468
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:15,025
Come!

469
01:27:30,517 --> 01:27:31,541
We are just there

470
01:27:49,636 --> 01:27:51,103
That's my empire

471
01:28:15,529 --> 01:28:16,757
and that's my treasure

472
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:32,511
Weather comes and gone

473
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:35,576
but memories never pass

474
01:28:41,889 --> 01:28:43,982
This letter taught me alot

475
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,227
That if you

476
01:28:50,097 --> 01:28:53,692
claim to love someone then have
some strength to forget him

477
01:28:58,038 --> 01:29:00,097
Sink down in your heart deepness

478
01:29:01,909 --> 01:29:04,309
Like you would have sinked down
when you were writing it

479
01:29:08,782 --> 01:29:11,649
And what l felt to being seperate
from you

480
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:18,780
And this coin!

481
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:30,160
lt always reminds me

482
01:29:30,737 --> 01:29:33,399
that if there some ugliness in this
world then there is some beauty

483
01:29:35,976 --> 01:29:37,807
lf there is darkness then there
is lzna

484
01:29:40,781 --> 01:29:41,645
lzna!

485
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:44,414
Light!

486
01:29:48,088 --> 01:29:49,749
What you were always for me

487
01:29:54,962 --> 01:29:56,452
But now l am not that anymore

488
01:29:59,566 --> 01:30:00,828
You are still the same

489
01:30:04,938 --> 01:30:06,530
Your eyes are same like earlier

490
01:30:08,508 --> 01:30:09,270
Clean!

491
01:30:14,348 --> 01:30:15,315
You are!

492
01:30:21,188 --> 01:30:22,815
l was so fool

493
01:30:30,998 --> 01:30:32,124
l thought....

494
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,958
l will turn this world into heaven

495
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:38,931
and then l will put stars
on your head

496
01:30:42,509 --> 01:30:44,500
A person who thinks....

497
01:30:45,946 --> 01:30:47,311
that he will be happy tomorrow

498
01:30:48,882 --> 01:30:50,179
he will be never happy....

499
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:57,420
Finally!

500
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:00,956
all we have these moments

501
01:31:03,597 --> 01:31:05,895
Come let's live this moment

502
01:31:34,461 --> 01:31:35,860
Save me from myself

503
01:44:51,791 --> 01:44:52,723
We are finished

504
01:44:54,927 --> 01:44:56,326
lt's just a matter of few time

505
01:44:57,330 --> 01:44:59,764
Once he will know that
Sumit is dead

506
01:45:02,201 --> 01:45:03,293
Before it happens

507
01:45:04,303 --> 01:45:05,327
We have to kill him

508
01:45:06,606 --> 01:45:07,766
Mix it in his drink

509
01:45:08,441 --> 01:45:09,567
Job will be done

510
01:45:10,443 --> 01:45:11,273
But!

511
01:45:11,744 --> 01:45:14,235
A Bomb blast occured opposite
to Dehli High Court

512
01:45:15,481 --> 01:45:16,505
200 people died

513
01:45:17,416 --> 01:45:18,280
Kabir was involved

514
01:45:19,519 --> 01:45:21,111
Who might be in your heart till yet

515
01:45:21,888 --> 01:45:23,822
But we are not like Kabir

516
01:45:24,257 --> 01:45:25,884
We don't kill people for nothing

517
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,761
You know it's a good deed to kill
a terrorist

518
01:45:31,364 --> 01:45:32,490
lt's not a murder

519
01:45:36,536 --> 01:45:37,468
You have to do it

520
01:45:38,204 --> 01:45:39,432
No!
Take it!

521
01:45:40,006 --> 01:45:41,132
l can't do it

522
01:45:42,375 --> 01:45:44,707
l can't kill anyone,
Anyone?

523
01:45:46,045 --> 01:45:47,706
Or him,
Tell me!

524
01:46:07,967 --> 01:46:09,662
You didn't take a single step

525
01:46:12,772 --> 01:46:15,104
You are stuck where you
were stood

526
01:46:16,509 --> 01:46:19,273
You were talking rubbish that your
mission is mine

527
01:46:20,846 --> 01:46:24,111
You took swear that you will kill him

528
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:25,580
What happen?

529
01:46:26,152 --> 01:46:27,278
Your hands are trembling

530
01:46:27,687 --> 01:46:29,211
lt's not true,
That's truth

531
01:46:31,190 --> 01:46:32,782
You promised me to support me

532
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:35,286
You took money forjob

533
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:38,262
Now l understood

534
01:46:39,532 --> 01:46:42,228
You used me to reach Kabir

535
01:46:46,505 --> 01:46:47,563
l will kill him!

536
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:52,538
Listen to me!

537
01:46:56,782 --> 01:46:57,942
You are right!

538
01:46:59,485 --> 01:47:02,215
l am still there where l was

539
01:47:03,456 --> 01:47:04,650
with those memories

540
01:47:06,225 --> 01:47:07,214
lt was my mistake

541
01:47:08,094 --> 01:47:10,153
l am judging you that time

542
01:47:11,163 --> 01:47:13,495
when you need me most

543
01:47:15,401 --> 01:47:16,231
l promise you

544
01:47:17,136 --> 01:47:18,000
l will kill him

545
01:47:18,404 --> 01:47:19,530
Give me this poison

546
01:47:26,379 --> 01:47:27,812
You have only two hours

547
01:47:29,782 --> 01:47:30,771
Finish the job

548
01:47:31,484 --> 01:47:32,951
Or l am coming to finish it

549
01:48:27,306 --> 01:48:29,934
You liked my coffee

550
01:48:32,278 --> 01:48:32,972
Wanna drink?

551
01:48:34,046 --> 01:48:35,707
Even l could drink poison from
your hands

552
01:48:59,438 --> 01:49:03,306
Lonely person often talking
to himself

553
01:50:11,443 --> 01:50:15,004
Life!
l just saw you in my dreams

554
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:27,592
lt's not your mistake

555
01:50:32,364 --> 01:50:35,197
Person have two ways in his life

556
01:50:37,102 --> 01:50:39,366
Rather he believe the lie and
live in senses

557
01:50:42,074 --> 01:50:44,235
Or he become mad to hear the truth

558
01:50:46,946 --> 01:50:47,742
That night....

559
01:50:49,081 --> 01:50:50,241
l left you

560
01:50:56,121 --> 01:50:57,520
For my country's goodness

561
01:50:58,858 --> 01:51:02,988
Pretending a traitor and joined
a drug carter

562
01:51:04,997 --> 01:51:07,295
then during a deal l found out that

563
01:51:07,466 --> 01:51:09,366
They are not the true enemies
of the country

564
01:51:11,103 --> 01:51:14,163
My own superiors, leaders

565
01:51:15,808 --> 01:51:19,209
Respected lntelligence officers and
they all are thieves

566
01:51:20,846 --> 01:51:22,279
They are the pimp of
War lndustries

567
01:51:23,515 --> 01:51:25,847
Who join with neighbour countries pimp

568
01:51:26,151 --> 01:51:30,451
made a war atmosphere in country
and in the name of country's security

569
01:51:30,623 --> 01:51:33,854
they bought weapong of billions

570
01:51:35,928 --> 01:51:36,917
And civilians....

571
01:51:39,031 --> 01:51:40,760
Civilians died with hunger

572
01:51:43,702 --> 01:51:46,102
That day l became mad

573
01:51:50,676 --> 01:51:53,736
My condition become like a prayer

574
01:51:55,915 --> 01:52:01,353
Who found out one day that for
that God he worships for his life

575
01:52:03,789 --> 01:52:05,086
that never existed

576
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,628
World only talks about love

577
01:52:19,271 --> 01:52:21,034
but runs on war,

578
01:52:27,079 --> 01:52:30,480
l made a list of those pimps

579
01:52:31,884 --> 01:52:35,820
and l started killing them
one by one

580
01:52:47,266 --> 01:52:49,496
Do you believe me?

581
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:53,260
You think your self Messiah

582
01:52:53,939 --> 01:52:55,531
You killed 200 people

583
01:53:00,145 --> 01:53:01,578
lt's not your mistake

584
01:53:03,482 --> 01:53:05,712
You have believed that lie

585
01:53:06,785 --> 01:53:11,848
what these powers sent you
in TV and newspapers

586
01:53:16,562 --> 01:53:19,759
But now l am tired with this life

587
01:53:23,202 --> 01:53:24,863
l can't believe in lie

588
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:29,298
and nobody wants to listen the truth

589
01:53:32,344 --> 01:53:33,971
Now l need peace

590
01:53:40,486 --> 01:53:42,579
Fighting in battle zone

591
01:53:45,124 --> 01:53:47,854
Not from this poison given
by cowards

592
01:53:53,432 --> 01:53:54,694
lt's not your mistake

593
01:53:56,268 --> 01:53:58,168
You have trapped in this controversy

lf you will take this data to them so
they will still kill you

596
01:54:08,147 --> 01:54:10,206
They are not Secret Agency People

597
01:54:10,949 --> 01:54:12,610
They are frauds!

598
01:54:14,286 --> 01:54:15,480

01:54:17,022 --> 01:54:20,890

And l am sorry

603
01:59:32,537 --> 01:59:35,267
lt's true that l was working
for War lndustries

604
01:59:36,241 --> 01:59:39,472
Those people gave us a contract
to get this data

605
01:59:39,778 --> 01:59:41,609
And after the job done you will
have to die

606
01:59:42,447 --> 01:59:43,778
But l won't let it happen

607
01:59:44,282 --> 01:59:45,909
l will give them data

608
01:59:46,184 --> 01:59:47,549
and tell them that you are dead

609
01:59:48,053 --> 01:59:49,111
They will listen to me

611
01:59:52,057 --> 01:59:54,252
Then we can start a new life

monster like you

618
02:00:36,601 --> 02:00:38,364

l am not an angel but a beast

623
02:01:00,625 --> 02:01:03,719
lf you will take a single step
then you will die

624
02:01:09,835 --> 02:01:11,462
l will live for the first time

625
02:03:36,648 --> 02:03:37,637
Heaven!

626
02:03:39,985 --> 02:03:41,179
or Hell!

627
02:03:48,393 --> 02:03:50,088
What to take from that heaven

628
02:03:51,363 --> 02:03:52,728
where you are not there

629
02:03:55,133 --> 02:03:57,124
And why to afraid from that hell
