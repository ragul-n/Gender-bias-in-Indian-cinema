1
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:09,117
_

2
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:11,213
_

3
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:13,358
_

4
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:15,579
_

5
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:18,160
_

6
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:22,995
You have made a very big mistake,

7
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:24,163
Mr. Dalton.

8
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:26,298
I can't imagine what you hoped to achieve

9
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:28,867
with this vicious and unwarranted attack

10
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:30,302
but I promise you,

11
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:33,005
we will meet you in equal measure.

12
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:35,607
President Ostrov, I can assure you

13
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:37,576
that the United States
is just learning of this

14
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:38,744
with the rest of the world.

15
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:40,612
Your lies are beneath you.

16
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:43,315
And they are an insult to
myself and the Russian people.

17
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,716
You will pay for this.

18
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:47,219
I am flattered that you think
we could organize a cyber attack

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,322
capable of crippling a city of
Moscow's power and magnitude.

20
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:52,257
If we had managed to pull that together,

21
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:53,625
it would have to be in response

22
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:55,260
to something equally unprecedented.

23
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,262
Like someone hacking into

24
00:00:57,263 --> 00:00:58,931
the navigation and communication system

25
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:00,332
on Air Force One,

26
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,534
putting the lives of all on board at risk.

27
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:04,069
You are insane.

28
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,371
Russia never hacked Air Force One.

29
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:08,941
And the U.S. didn't black out Moscow.

30
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:11,810
So we can part on neutral ground.

31
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:13,846
No, we will part on my promise

32
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:17,182
that Russia will not stand for
this affront to its sovereignty,

33
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:20,886
and retaliatory measures
will be taken immediately.

34
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:24,323
Well, I like her.

35
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:25,691
She's got moxie.

36
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:28,060
Mr. President, I think we can file that one

37
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:29,294
under "message received."

38
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:30,762
Am I the only one

39
00:01:30,763 --> 00:01:32,664
concerned about her subtle

40
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:33,899
vows of retaliation?

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,000
Par for the course.

42
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,835
That's pretty much the clarion call

43
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:38,003
of any aggrieved demagogue.

44
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,272
Actually, the smart thing

45
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:43,041
for her to do would be to
deny the U.S.'s involvement.

46
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:45,711
Spare herself the
embarrassment of taking the hit.

47
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:47,012
So we're betting on smart?

48
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:50,082
The fact that she's even
running the show is theater.

49
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,717
She's gonna listen to the counsel

50
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:53,051
of her generals and advisors.

51
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:53,986
They understand the cost

52
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:55,487
of a military response.

53
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:57,189
And we can track any
movement in that regard.

54
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,191
But we're not too concerned.

55
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:00,559
She's been put in her place.

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,262
And she knows we won't tolerate any signs

57
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:05,330
of aggression toward us or Ukraine.

58
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:06,798
All right. Well...

59
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,036
I'll get to work on
State's non-denial denial.

60
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:13,171
Make it a full-throttle denial.

61
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:15,040
Lying to save the world is allowed.

62
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,341
It's in the Constitution.

63
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:17,409
Okay.

64
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,911
Where the cyber attack is concerned,

65
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:21,213
we're in the dark right along with them.

66
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:22,247
That's good.

67
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:24,249
I'm not really going to say that.

68
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,184
I would.

69
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:27,486
Thanks, everyone.

70
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,755
Is it wrong to eat cereal for dinner?

71
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:31,489
I don't care.

72
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,994
So how was your day, Slugger?

73
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:37,629
Or... Boomer.

74
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,998
What is the universal linebacker nickname?

75
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,466
- Brainless.
- Be nice.

76
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:44,870
So this horse

77
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,838
walks into the doctor's office.

78
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,206
The doctor says...

79
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:49,741
- why the long face?
- ...why the long face?

80
00:02:49,742 --> 00:02:50,842
I don't know.

81
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:52,377
I just love that.

82
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:53,478
It gets me every time.

83
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,380
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

84
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,548
So?

85
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:58,617
What's up?

86
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:02,154
I, uh, just got some
bad news from the coach.

87
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:03,555
Oh, no.

88
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:05,157
- Is he cutting you?
- No.

89
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:06,391
He's, uh, he's starting me.

90
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:08,727
- Well...
- Wow.

91
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:09,995
- ...hey, that's great.
- I mean...

92
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:12,331
I'd think you'd be excited about that.

93
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:13,999
We're facing the biggest team

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,867
in the league, with the
playoffs on the line,

95
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:16,969
and suddenly it's my turn?

96
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,737
Well, Jason, he must have seen

97
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:20,472
a lot of progress in practice.

98
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:21,907
- Otherwise, he wouldn't put you in.
- Yeah.

99
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:23,108
Nice try, Dad.

100
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:25,110
Derrick got benched for a "D" in geometry,

101
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:26,979
Eli broke his arm and
Gabe's moving to Florida.

102
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,014
So I'm sort of forced into this one.

103
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:31,850
Are you afraid you're going to get hurt?

104
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,218
No, I'm worried about being humiliated

105
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,353
and letting the whole team,

106
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:35,954
and in fact the whole school, down.

107
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:37,522
I mean, I did this to make friends

108
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:39,558
and I'm about to alienate everyone I know.

109
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:41,159
Jace, it's gonna be okay.

110
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,195
Or maybe you won't even play.

111
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:45,364
Everyone's saying that
Russia's going to retaliate

112
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:46,632
for the cyber attack.

113
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,399
Hard to have Friday Night
Lights with no lights.

114
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,868
What cyber attack?

115
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:51,136
Where did you get this?

116
00:03:51,137 --> 00:03:52,604
Um... every major news outlet?

117
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:55,574
Yeah, well, it's all speculation.

118
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:57,342
There's no evidence of an attack.

119
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:59,544
Why don't you kids go eat in
front of the TV? Sound good?

120
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:02,012
Okay, now I know the world is ending.

121
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:07,019
So...

122
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,285
Was it us?

123
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:12,157
Russia has an antiquated infrastructure.

124
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:14,292
The blackout could be

125
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,594
the Chernobyl of the power grid.

126
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:18,263
Okay, I know that we can't divulge stuff,

127
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:20,098
but I didn't know we'd moved
on to spinning each other.

128
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,533
I'm just giving you

129
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:23,669
what the White House's
official position is.

130
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,370
Okay, let's try this:

131
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:26,738
If it was us, was it in response

132
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:28,183
to what happened on Air Force One?

133
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,308
Solar flares happened on Air Force One.

134
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:31,810
I was read in to that one.

135
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:33,244
I know about the malware.

136
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,082
Well... but not who was behind it,

137
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,650
because we didn't know.

138
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:39,785
And we do now?

139
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,119
Are you okay?

140
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,022
'Cause I know that you've
been very stressed out.

141
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,857
Don't gaslight me.

142
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,893
I... You're the one who's been all worried

143
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:49,227
about us keeping secrets.

144
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:50,629
That was just venting.

145
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,564
This is real world.

146
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:55,534
Henry, we almost went to...

147
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:59,838
to prison for sharing
classified information.

148
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,239
So we cannot talk.

149
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,542
I thought maybe being on
the verge of World War III

150
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:05,143
might change the rules.

151
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:06,911
Nope.

152
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:13,351
Can we maybe just... stop talking

153
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:16,088
about what we may or
may not be talking about?

154
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:18,255
Sure.

155
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,462
Where are you going?

156
00:05:23,463 --> 00:05:25,095
Can't talk about it.

157
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:37,709
Do you know anything about
the situation in Russia?

158
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,111
Nothing.

159
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:40,846
I could speculate, but DIA hasn't

160
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,514
read me into anything.

161
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:43,949
- Any word from Dmitri?
- No.

162
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,618
I don't know how long he stayed in Moscow

163
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:48,353
after he contacted us.

164
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:49,821
Did he feel like he'd been compromised?

165
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,056
He didn't say anything,

166
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:53,024
but it could be the
reason that he wanted out.

167
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:55,627
That would be unfortunate.

168
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:57,129
Has the president seen
the battle plan report

169
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,597
from Doroshevich?

170
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:00,132
The president? No.

171
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,333
Uh, why would he?

172
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:02,801
He might be interested to know

173
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:04,402
about a planned attack on Ukraine.

174
00:06:04,403 --> 00:06:06,738
You think he doesn't know
Russia has designs on Ukraine?

175
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:10,041
He might also be interested
in what wasn't in the report.

176
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,409
What would that be?

177
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,013
Any plan to attack the computer
system of Air Force One.

178
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:17,182
Okay, I'm not connecting the dots here.

179
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:20,252
If the blackout was an attack by the U.S.,

180
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:21,486
they went under the assumption

181
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:23,421
that Russia was behind
the hack of Air Force One.

182
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:24,456
Okay.

183
00:06:24,457 --> 00:06:25,657
The playbook that Dmitri gave us

184
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:28,026
laid out Russia's entire strategy

185
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:29,761
for the invasion of Ukraine,

186
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:31,797
including aggressive diversionary tactics

187
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:32,898
to deter U.S. involvement.

188
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,133
Okay, what is your ETA on the point, Henry?

189
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:37,435
Gamed out every crazy scenario,

190
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:39,671
from taking over Arctic drilling sites

191
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:41,406
to instigating conflict with ISIS.

192
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,841
But there was nothing...

193
00:06:42,842 --> 00:06:47,979
nothing about a hack of Air Force One.

194
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,248
Just because they didn't
put it in the report

195
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:51,583
doesn't mean they didn't do it.

196
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,218
You're trying to prove a negative.

197
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:55,720
You don't want to get
into a dialectic with me.

198
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:56,988
Okay. You're right.

199
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:58,557
I don't even want to
have this conversation.

200
00:06:58,558 --> 00:06:59,591
You're crossing lines.

201
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:01,378
Just tell me you'll make an effort

202
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,943
to get this report to the White House.

203
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:03,995
How?

204
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:05,664
Call the President.

205
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:07,532
Demand to see him.

206
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,334
Henry, you might be
coming a little unglued.

207
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:11,536
I know you're upset about Dmitri.

208
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:13,438
At least get it into the
hands of Ephraim Ware.

209
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,073
The DNI needs to know about this.

210
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:17,242
Stop. You're getting above your pay grade.

211
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:18,210
And mine.

212
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:19,344
You've done your duty, Professor.

213
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:20,545
Let us handle this.

214
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:00,585
These three pipelines went off-line

215
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:01,987
approximately two hours ago.

216
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:04,422
We've received reliable verification

217
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:06,091
from both U.S. and European intelligence

218
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:08,560
that the pipelines were shut down

219
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,594
by direct order of Maria Ostrov.

220
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:13,298
Those particular pipelines

221
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:16,034
provide 40% of Western
Europe's supply of gas.

222
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:17,969
Just as they're heading into

223
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,938
one of the fiercest winters
predicted in decades.

224
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:22,172
So much for blustering.

225
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:25,277
It's a clear message

226
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:27,345
that she's not playing by the rules.

227
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:28,680
She's escalating the conflict.

228
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:32,183
Turning America's NATO
allies into collateral damage.

229
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:34,519
Mr. President, they want
to break the alliance

230
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,721
so they can run the
table with Eastern Europe.

231
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:38,556
It's something Pavel Ostrov coveted

232
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:40,458
and now she's trying to make it happen.

233
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,727
This has stopped being a dialogue.

234
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:44,628
It's a march to war.

235
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:48,066
Then we need to retaliate.

236
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,834
And we need to hit them hard.

237
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,709
<b>Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.</b>

238
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:10,784
We can neutralize the targets in Crimea.

239
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:11,885
Air strikes to follow,

240
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:12,886
to address any aggression

241
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:13,954
on the Ukraine border.

242
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:15,722
And, worst-case scenario,

243
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:16,723
boots on the ground.

244
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,258
Just enough to make a point.

245
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,360
And what point is that?

246
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,341
That we're willing to use military force.

247
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:24,464
But I thought the point
of the power grid attack

248
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:26,867
is that we weren't willing to do that.

249
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:28,869
That was before this latest action.

250
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,038
You had to know they would respond.

251
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,239
We honestly thought

252
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,440
it would be much more measured.

253
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,175
This... this is extreme.

254
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:37,476
They escalated, so we have to.

255
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,648
Why can't we reach out to our allies?

256
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,251
Western Europe's holding
us fully accountable.

257
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:45,619
They're blaming us for all of it.

258
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,987
Well, of course they are.

259
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:49,389
Because no one knows what's going on.

260
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,624
We're still calling

261
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,759
Air Force One solar flares.

262
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,393
What are you proposing?

263
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,197
I want to go before the UN.

264
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:58,732
I want to give them a lay down speech

265
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,934
and spell it out for them,

266
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,235
step by step.

267
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:05,339
We give evidence of
military overreach by Russia

268
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,807
against the U.S. and Ukraine.

269
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:10,843
We divulge all of their aggression.

270
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,280
The attack on Air Force One,

271
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:16,350
the Poloniumed hacker,

272
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,985
the financial records
that point to Russian GRU.

273
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,788
Mr. President, that is a radical

274
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:22,856
roll of the dice.

275
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,825
Putting all our cards on the table

276
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,193
leaves us nowhere else to turn

277
00:10:26,194 --> 00:10:27,527
if the allies don't go for it.

278
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,359
Which, given the current climate,

279
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,964
I think it's a pretty safe bet they won't.

280
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,934
Nowhere else to turn?

281
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:36,370
You mean, as opposed to

282
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:38,071
all those other comfortable options

283
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,806
we'll have after we launch

284
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,742
a full-scale military campaign

285
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:45,045
against the world's second
biggest nuclear power?

286
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:48,148
Elizabeth, it's an enormous gamble.

287
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,883
For starters, it would have to be

288
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,017
the speech of your life,

289
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,186
right up there with Adlai Stevenson

290
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:54,321
in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

291
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,690
I think that's an apt analogy.

292
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:58,991
And I think I'm up to it.

293
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,033
I don't see what we have to lose.

294
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,301
Sir?

295
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,737
All due respect, everything.

296
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,706
The upper hand, the element of surprise...

297
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:15,675
General, we forfeited all
that with the cyber attack.

298
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,811
Now we're being pulled into Russia's game.

299
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:20,447
Escalating the conflict is our only choice,

300
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:22,916
unless we can get the
allies to circle the wagons.

301
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,252
It's...

302
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:28,321
it's gonna take the
world's commitment to war

303
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,757
in order to actually stop the war.

304
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,859
It has to happen in the next 24 hours.

305
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,196
We-we cannot give Russia time
to one-up our show of force

306
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,764
should we decide to go there.

307
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,031
Agreed.

308
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,235
Let's get on the line with President Bozek.

309
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:43,445
We can't do this alone.

310
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:46,406
We need to get Ukraine on board.

311
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:49,776
I appreciate you taking me into
your confidence, Mr. President.

312
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,445
Tell me, what is your plan.

313
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,799
We intend to draw a line in the sand.

314
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,735
And that line is the Ukrainian border.

315
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:59,938
In addition to the, uh, lethal
aide we've already provided,

316
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:03,367
we plan to send American
advisors to the east

317
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:06,972
and enforce a no-fly zone
over Ukrainian airspace.

318
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,240
You don't know how long

319
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:10,709
I've waited to hear these
words of support from you.

320
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,478
Tell me, what can I do in return?

321
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,815
I'm-I'm glad you asked, Mikhail.

322
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,384
All of this will depend on
the support of our allies,

323
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:23,054
which I have to rally in the next 24 hours.

324
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:26,091
It won't be easy, so the
more evidence that we have

325
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:28,894
to convince them that Ostrov
was behind the cyber attack

326
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:31,396
on your plane and ours, the better.

327
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:34,332
I'll need any information that you have.

328
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,668
That is easily provided, Madam Secretary.

329
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,837
And I will need you at my side

330
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:41,106
when I make the address at the U.N.

331
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:43,675
I will make preparations to
fly to New York right away.

332
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,175
Thank you.

333
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,082
Better get your staff to work

334
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,384
on the speech of your life.

335
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:00,559
The objective is simple.

336
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,727
Convince the entire world...

337
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:04,930
particularly our allies...

338
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,666
that we are justified
and willing to go to war

339
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,367
to contain Russian aggression.

340
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:12,367
So, your basic St. Crispin's Day speech.

341
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,035
Yes.

342
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:15,837
Hopefully without having to go into battle.

343
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,445
Once we have the authority,

344
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,447
the idea is that we
won't have to enforce it.

345
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:20,648
That's a big risk.

346
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:22,616
We're aware.

347
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:24,719
How much of the classified stuff

348
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,952
do you want me to use?

349
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:27,821
Outside of sources and methods,

350
00:13:27,822 --> 00:13:30,957
the president has authorized all of it.

351
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,325
- All of it.
- All if it?

352
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:34,494
We're giving up George Lasko as the guy

353
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:35,729
who hacked Air Force One?

354
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,097
His connection to Russia?

355
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:38,899
The attack on President Bozek's plane?

356
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,333
The Polonium assassination...?

357
00:13:40,334 --> 00:13:42,869
That pretty much covers
what I mean by "all of it."

358
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,871
If we are showing our entire hand,

359
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:47,504
it means the end of
any kind of negotiation.

360
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:49,508
That's why this speech has to work.

361
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:53,451
Hi, welcome to Smokin' Al's.

362
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:01,724
I only have ten minutes.

363
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:03,643
That's all I need.

364
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:06,713
I have to admit I never expected
you to be in a place like this.

365
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,306
Well, that's why we're here.

366
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,542
Does your wife know that you eat like that?

367
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:11,876
Of course not.

368
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:14,012
What can I do for you, Henry?

369
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:17,082
I need to bring you some intelligence

370
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,483
that I've uncovered.

371
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:21,086
I've taken it as far as I
can with DIA, but it stalled.

372
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:23,988
I assume you talked to
Jane Fellows about this?

373
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,790
She essentially terminated my assignment,

374
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,193
but you're my original recruiter.

375
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:29,427
That's where it ends.

376
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:31,973
Russell, my asset managed to lift

377
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:35,867
Russia's entire playbook
for the invasion of Ukraine.

378
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:40,004
They spell out every scenario imaginable,

379
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,507
including a number of ways
to manage the U.S. reaction.

380
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,577
Yet nowhere is this exhaustive document

381
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:48,979
is there any mention of
hacking Air Force One.

382
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,485
Why are you telling me this now
when we are right in the middle

383
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:55,987
of a military campaign
against Maria Ostrov?

384
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:58,590
Before the Challenger exploded...

385
00:14:58,591 --> 00:14:59,385
The space shuttle?

386
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,121
- What kind...? What is...?
- Low-level engineers

387
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:03,094
discovered serious design
flaws with the shuttle;

388
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:05,807
particularly related to the O-rings,

389
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:07,542
which they knew could not withstand

390
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:09,544
extreme changes in temperature.

391
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:11,313
They kept pushing the information upstairs,

392
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:12,481
but it stalled.

393
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:13,548
Or 9/11...

394
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:14,516
Here we go.

395
00:15:14,517 --> 00:15:16,084
The CIA and FBI

396
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:17,319
may have had enough foreknowledge

397
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,321
of Al-Qaeda's plan to stop the attacks,

398
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:23,058
but because of bureaucratic intransigence,

399
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,860
they never even spoke to one another.

400
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:26,428
So what, so in this
parable, I'm the lackey,

401
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,797
who waves you off and says
it's above my pay grade?

402
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:30,699
No, that was Jane Fellows.
You're the guy that never

403
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,234
got the information in the first place.

404
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,136
You have the power to stop this.

405
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:35,370
Stop what?

406
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:37,138
We've already engaged.

407
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:41,510
You mean the cyber
attack on the power grid?

408
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:43,011
The entire intelligence community believes

409
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:44,579
Russia was behind Air Force One.

410
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,914
So even if they didn't do it,

411
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:47,115
they did it, understand...?

412
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,051
There you go.

413
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:50,752
And you're willing to go to war over that?

414
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:53,121
We are trying our damnedest to stop a war

415
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:56,959
by creating a united
front... do you get that?!

416
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,627
If you tell your wife

417
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:01,463
any of this "Russia didn't do it" nonsense,

418
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:03,999
based on classified Intel from DIA,

419
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,534
you'll be thrown in prison

420
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:07,469
for the rest of your mortal days.

421
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,570
Both of you, understood?

422
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:14,742
Just keep your head
down and your mouth shut.

423
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:21,148
For God's sake, just do
what we tell you to do.

424
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:32,828
Well, whoever she is,

425
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:34,730
I hope she fed you.

426
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:37,132
We finished off the Kung Pao chicken.

427
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,735
She was an endless seminar
on the Sino-Soviet split

428
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:42,471
and its effect on the end of the Cold War,

429
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:45,340
which is ironic given the day's headlines.

430
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:47,376
Might be a spring roll or two left.

431
00:16:47,377 --> 00:16:49,643
You could have that.

432
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,948
We have to talk.

433
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:54,416
No, we really don't.

434
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:56,618
I understand you're scheduled
to speak at the U.N. tomorrow.

435
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:58,420
That's right.

436
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:00,255
- What if I knew something that would change
- Stop!

437
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:01,790
the way that you approach this?

438
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,425
Henry, I-I don't make the decisions

439
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:04,926
on how to approach this.

440
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:06,428
You're gonna reveal Russia's involvement

441
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:08,063
in the Air Force One hack in hopes

442
00:17:08,064 --> 00:17:09,731
of getting the allies to fall into place.

443
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:11,733
And if you do your job well,

444
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,735
which you have a track record of doing,

445
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:15,804
then the world will be poised to go to war

446
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:18,640
with a country that is just unstable enough

447
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:21,743
to take the bait.

448
00:17:21,744 --> 00:17:23,845
If you're wrong,

449
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:26,181
do you really want to
be on the side of that?

450
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:27,949
Well, obviously I wouldn't make this speech

451
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,151
if I thought I were wrong.

452
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:30,519
At what point would you be willing

453
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,156
to violate this cone of silence between us?

454
00:17:34,157 --> 00:17:36,825
What would it take?

455
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:38,293
Would millions of lives
have to be at stake?

456
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:39,428
Because that's where we are.

457
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:40,829
You're scaring me, Henry.

458
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,130
Good, because this is scary.

459
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:47,202
I'm willing to roll the
dice on going to prison.

460
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:49,337
But what I'm not willing to do

461
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:52,773
is live with what might
happen if we don't talk.

462
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:57,712
We know things

463
00:17:57,713 --> 00:17:59,214
that can help each other.

464
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:00,982
That's not the point.

465
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:02,918
Actually, that is the point...

466
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,786
I don't think the Russians
hacked Air Force One.

467
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:11,093
Look, we have incontrovertible proof.

468
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:12,127
Do you?

469
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:13,995
On multiple fronts.

470
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:15,430
Then explain this to me.

471
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:17,132
If Russia hacked Air Force One,

472
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,067
then they have the most
advanced cyber capabilities

473
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:20,702
of any country on the planet.

474
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:23,305
And what is their response

475
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:26,208
to a counter-cyber attack
by the United States?

476
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:29,843
They shut off the gas.

477
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,352
You have more to go on than speculation?

478
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:40,688
I mean, if we're gonna go
all the way with this...

479
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:45,360
I have an asset,

480
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,729
who works for a top advisor to Ostrov.

481
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:54,202
If Russia didn't do this,

482
00:18:54,203 --> 00:18:56,605
if they're not behind it, then who?

483
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:57,873
I don't know.

484
00:18:57,874 --> 00:18:59,040
Does it really matter?

485
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,643
I have to present some plausible theory

486
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:03,211
to get them off of this path...

487
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:05,313
I haven't gotten that far.

488
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:08,917
But, babe, I know this is a leap.

489
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:13,387
And I know there's a chance that I'm wrong.

490
00:19:14,156 --> 00:19:17,992
But what if I'm not?

491
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,686
_

492
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:36,680
I need you guys to streamline

493
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:38,749
whatever we have that directly links

494
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,335
Lasko with the Russians.

495
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:41,536
Primarily it's the money.

496
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:44,576
An e-mail on his computer
from a Russian bank...

497
00:19:44,577 --> 00:19:47,586
one associated with GRU...
informing him of a wire transfer

498
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,153
to his Cayman Islands bank account.

499
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,890
Okay, it says here the NSA
was monitoring this bank

500
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,158
for criminal activity.

501
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,094
So where's the record of
a transfer from Russia?

502
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,262
Uh...

503
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,831
NSA has no corresponding
record of a wire transfer.

504
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,266
But they're not perfect.

505
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:06,003
It's, you know, often these
shady banks have multiple...

506
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,105
If NSA has no record of a wire transfer,

507
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,475
then how do we know that
the e-mail is legitimate?

508
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,410
We traced its IP address
back to Moscow servers.

509
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:14,745
IP addresses can be faked

510
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,480
to look like they come from anywhere.

511
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,982
Sure, but it's a convergence of evidence.

512
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:22,319
Ma'am, the odds of all this
being counterfeit are very slim.

513
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,922
It's like he says... "a
convergence of evidence."

514
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,456
I heard him.

515
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:29,326
And I'm gonna ask you
both to stop saying that.

516
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:31,862
Because "convergence of evidence"

517
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,263
is beginning to sound eerily

518
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:37,166
like the new "weapons of mass destruction"

519
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:41,038
So, Oliver, I'm gonna ask you again.

520
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,372
On the eve of my telling

521
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:45,175
the entire world that

522
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:49,079
Russia is behind the greatest
cyber attack in human history,

523
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,649
prompting actions which could lead us all

524
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,254
into the greatest world
conflict in human history...

525
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:01,562
there's a chance that all
the evidence we have here

526
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:03,360
is fake?

527
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,362
Yes, ma'am.

528
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:07,797
There is a chance.

529
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:28,788
It's a little long.

530
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,523
I could definitely take some trims.

531
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:34,271
I might've used, uh, JFK too many times.

532
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:36,296
But I think it will get the point across.

533
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:38,031
Madam Secretary, Russell Jackson's office

534
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:40,566
is demanding to see a draft of the speech.

535
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:43,136
He wants to vet it in time for changes.

536
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:44,570
I'm sure he does.

537
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:47,106
And, uh, you are scheduled to leave

538
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:48,808
from the White House lawn in two hours.

539
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,711
Four major networks cleared
time for a breaking news segment.

540
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:59,018
I'm gonna, uh,

541
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,354
take this little window of time.

542
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:03,423
I'm just gonna say this.

543
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:07,192
What if we're wrong?

544
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,730
About what?

545
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:13,032
Oh, I don't know.

546
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,767
Everything. All of it.

547
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:18,670
What if Russia wasn't behind
the Air Force One hack?

548
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,608
Isn't it a little late
in the game for that?

549
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,744
Oh, no. I-I think it's exactly
the right point in the game.

550
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,352
It's, uh, fair to say

551
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:36,923
that Russia is not an utter certainty,

552
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:39,025
but nothing points to another actor.

553
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,493
And given that, I think...

554
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:43,029
clearly, the-the White House thinks...

555
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,665
that we should proceed with what we know.

556
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,401
How many messes

557
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:50,737
have we gotten ourselves into

558
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:52,839
with what we were

559
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,307
almost sure we knew?

560
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:58,010
I'm just asking for a
quick, exhaustive review.

561
00:22:58,011 --> 00:22:59,879
Let's just take a few minutes

562
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,648
and consider the other possibilities.

563
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:05,918
Okay, so let's... backtrack.

564
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,488
We're reasonably sure that George Lasko

565
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:10,223
was behind the hack of Air Force One.

566
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,891
He had previous connections

567
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:14,761
to Russia and China, North Korea and Iran.

568
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:15,895
And now he's dead

569
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,663
by way of polonium poisoning.

570
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,832
I think we can rule out Iran.

571
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,568
Our nuclear agreement closely monitors

572
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:23,770
their radioactive material.

573
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:25,104
We can rule out North Korea.

574
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:26,773
Their nuclear capabilities

575
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:28,841
are not sophisticated enough
to synthesize polonium.

576
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:30,276
That leaves China,

577
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:31,444
which makes some sense.

578
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:33,346
How is that?

579
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:34,647
With Russia and the U.S.

580
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:36,516
locked in a slowly escalating conflict...

581
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:37,950
Or quickly escalating.

582
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:40,119
...China is free to shore up

583
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,654
control over Southeast Asia.

584
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:43,423
It's a long shot,

585
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:45,625
but it might be worth looking into.

586
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:47,126
Even though it would ruin my speech.

587
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,928
You're saying China framed Russia

588
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,129
for the Air Force One hack?

589
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,130
I'm not saying.

590
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:52,365
I'm just asking.

591
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,567
Mr. Jackson's office

592
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:55,935
is again asking for your speech.

593
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,103
This time in all caps.

594
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,805
He is officially shouting.

595
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:01,240
Right.

596
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:03,943
Tell him we're putting the
finishing touches on the speech.

597
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,211
Yes, ma'am.

598
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,746
If you'll excuse me,

599
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:09,949
I obfuscate more effectively by phone.

600
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,584
You will be the first to know.

601
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:13,152
Okay.

602
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:15,321
Good-bye.

603
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:16,656
I hate to bother you.

604
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:20,726
Yes, I read your first draft.

605
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:23,161
You're really gonna make me ask?

606
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,966
I think it's the finest piece of writing

607
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,701
- I've ever seen from you.
- Really?

608
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:32,203
No, I'm shining you on
because I hate to disappoint.

609
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,409
It is good, isn't it?

610
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,410
It's brilliant.

611
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:44,150
- She's never gonna use it, is she?
- Matt...

612
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,752
this speech was intended

613
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,394
to rally the nations of the world

614
00:24:49,395 --> 00:24:53,092
into a potential war with Russia.

615
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:55,595
If the secretary never reads it out loud,

616
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,730
that would mean the best
of all possible outcomes

617
00:24:57,731 --> 00:24:59,332
had been achieved.

618
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,666
Don't you agree?

619
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,233
Of course.

620
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,372
Minister Chen,

621
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:09,408
thank you for coming
in on such short notice.

622
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:11,677
I was surprised by the
urgent nature of the request.

623
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,079
I'm aware that you are scheduled

624
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,047
to appear before the UN in a few hours.

625
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:16,883
Please, have a seat.

626
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:19,018
Word is that you intend to address

627
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,453
the recent events in Russia.

628
00:25:20,454 --> 00:25:21,420
Minister Chen,

629
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:23,689
you-you recall a couple of months ago

630
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,458
when the communications system

631
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,859
on Air Force One was shut down?

632
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,961
The result of solar flares, was it not?

633
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:32,564
That was our best working
theory at the time, yes.

634
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,067
But we have reason to believe

635
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:37,970
there may be other factors involved.

636
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,806
You mean someone hacked into the system?

637
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:43,209
Possibly.

638
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,810
I wanted to ask you

639
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:47,547
about information that you might have

640
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:51,117
about other actors who might have

641
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:54,152
had reason to engage in such aggression.

642
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,256
One of the things I've always valued

643
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:58,658
about you, Madam Secretary,

644
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,493
is that you tend to speak plainly.

645
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:01,894
I urge you to do so now.

646
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,230
Did you guys do it?

647
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,531
Did China

648
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:08,134
hire George Lasko, aka Dash,

649
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:09,535
to hack Air Force One?

650
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,870
You can't be serious.

651
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:12,104
I assure you,

652
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:14,240
I have never been more serious.

653
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,376
And why would we do that?

654
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:20,179
Engaging the U.S. and-and Russia

655
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,015
in a costly military conflict

656
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:25,151
would free China up to pursue

657
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,353
a number of foreign interests.

658
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:29,755
In the year 2000,

659
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,092
China owned only six percent of
the United States' foreign debt.

660
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:36,462
Now we own over 21%.

661
00:26:36,463 --> 00:26:39,231
We have over $1 trillion in U.S. securities

662
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,602
and hundreds of billions
in Russian securities.

663
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:44,737
If we pitted the two of
you against each other

664
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,739
in a nuclear war,

665
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,241
what good would that do
our investment portfolio?

666
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:52,777
So you had nothing to
do with Air Force One?

667
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,415
China is playing a long
game, Madam Secretary.

668
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,518
When we come for you,

669
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,055
it won't be with missiles
and cyber attacks.

670
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,224
We'll repossess you.

671
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,463
- I apologize, Madam Secretary.
- Thank you, Blake.

672
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:10,251
_

673
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:11,408
Grilling Oliver Shaw

674
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:12,608
about the Air Force One hack

675
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:13,783
in front of the Director

676
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:16,111
- of National Intelligence?
- I wouldn't call it a grilling.

677
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:17,813
And now I'm hearing about
some emergency meeting

678
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:20,349
with Minister Chen about God knows what.

679
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,484
Maybe we got different playbooks,

680
00:27:22,485 --> 00:27:24,186
but when appealing to the world

681
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:25,621
to go to war with Russia,

682
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:28,057
I think it's important
to get the facts straight.

683
00:27:28,058 --> 00:27:30,926
Your facts are about as
straight as they're gonna get.

684
00:27:30,927 --> 00:27:32,828
I hope to hell you're not
talking to Henry about this.

685
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:34,597
What does Henry have to do with anything?

686
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:38,133
He came to me, babbling
about some half-cocked theory.

687
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:41,136
Well, that's between you and Henry.

688
00:27:41,137 --> 00:27:43,472
I have serious questions.

689
00:27:43,473 --> 00:27:45,641
And I am telling you that you don't.

690
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:47,943
Marine One is out there
on the lawn right now,

691
00:27:47,944 --> 00:27:49,845
Air Force One is ready at Andrews,

692
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:51,680
ready to take you to the UN

693
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:54,350
to make a speech you insisted
on giving not 24 hours ago.

694
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:58,821
If I make this speech and we're wrong,

695
00:27:58,822 --> 00:28:02,992
it could destroy the U.S.'s
credibility for decades.

696
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:06,161
If I miss the speech, Russell,

697
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:08,730
it's barely a footnote in history.

698
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:15,170
I am telling you to get on Marine One.

699
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:17,405
The president's waiting.

700
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:33,855
Aren't you supposed to
be at the UN right now?

701
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,925
Henry, you'd better be right about this.

702
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:03,332
_

703
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,489
_

704
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:08,649
_

705
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:11,972
_

706
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:14,014
_

707
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,956
_

708
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:18,175
Jeffrey, when I say

709
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:20,105
the secretary won't be
addressing this matter

710
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:22,907
in the press today, that is
exactly what I mean by that.

711
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:24,675
Obviously, she had a reason

712
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:27,011
for canceling her appearance at the UN.

713
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:29,313
Look, I'm not saying it's
related to national security.

714
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:30,748
You are. And if you print it,

715
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:33,116
you'd better have your
attorney on speed dial.

716
00:29:34,285 --> 00:29:35,319
Wow.

717
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,454
You're getting good at that.

718
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:37,989
I'm getting a lot of practice today.

719
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,957
Look, if we just release a statement,

720
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,359
the press will calm down.

721
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,860
Anything we feed them

722
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:44,762
is going to make them hungrier.

723
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:45,696
Let's wait

724
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:47,865
until we have something to say.

725
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:50,167
Like, for example, I've been fired.

726
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:52,370
Mr. Jackson's office has been

727
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:54,138
eerily quiet.

728
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:56,140
Yes, and it's speaking volumes.

729
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:57,641
What's it saying, exactly?

730
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:00,545
The White House

731
00:30:00,546 --> 00:30:02,213
doesn't want to look unstable

732
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:03,881
in the middle of a crisis.

733
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:05,950
They'll deal with me later.

734
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:08,619
...announcing our renewed partnership

735
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,154
with the people of Ukraine.

736
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:14,625
Today, we are drawing a line in the sand.

737
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:16,627
Because when it comes
to the cause of freedom,

738
00:30:16,628 --> 00:30:18,563
we are all Ukrainians.

739
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:20,998
My speech was so much better.

740
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:26,637
Well, in order to facilitate
avoiding the press,

741
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:29,740
I'm officially making myself unavailable.

742
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:32,076
I have a football game to get to.

743
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:33,210
And when I get back,

744
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:34,879
let's figure out what I'm going to say

745
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,881
about not having anything to say to the UN.

746
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:43,953
What?

747
00:30:45,923 --> 00:30:48,659
I don't know.

748
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,828
It's kind of bizarre.

749
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:53,129
Then it ought to feel right at home.

750
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:56,366
What?

751
00:30:58,302 --> 00:31:01,706
When Bozek came to D.C. a month ago,

752
00:31:01,707 --> 00:31:04,075
he was on his knees

753
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:05,876
begging for NATO membership.

754
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:07,778
Now look at him: at the White House,

755
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:10,348
with the President of the United States

756
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:13,283
doing everything but making a blood pact?

757
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:17,787
He's getting more than he wanted.

758
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,491
He is, isn't he?

759
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,728
I'm saying it's weird.

760
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,432
What are you saying?

761
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:31,702
The man had to jump out of his own plane.

762
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:33,371
That's insane, right?

763
00:31:33,372 --> 00:31:35,573
Right.

764
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,608
Pull the staff together.

765
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,343
Find out everything you can

766
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:42,046
about the incident on Bozek's plane.

767
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:44,682
Quietly.

768
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,017
And if word gets out,

769
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:47,685
I'll swear you all went rogue.

770
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:49,720
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:31:54,525 --> 00:31:55,626
Come on, Panthers! Let's go!

772
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:57,528
Hold 'em! You got this!

773
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:59,497
Tackled by number 46...

774
00:31:59,498 --> 00:32:01,065
I don't know what I was worried about.

775
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:02,166
I mean, he's doing great.

776
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:04,035
He's missed every tackle.

777
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:06,370
That's what I'm talking about.

778
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:07,738
He's doing the bare minimum.

779
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:10,340
Babe, I think he's playing
at the top of his game.

780
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:13,477
Well, even better.

781
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:15,613
Those big guys are just brushing by him.

782
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:17,814
Works for me.

783
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:22,186
So is it a totally crazy idea

784
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:25,856
that the Ukrainians
hacked into Air Force One,

785
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:28,359
pinned it on the Russians,
and then orchestrated

786
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,394
their own plane crash
to cover their tracks?

787
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:32,096
Why?

788
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:34,799
Because I need to know just how crazy it is

789
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,400
before I go down this road.

790
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:37,401
No, I mean,

791
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:38,636
why would they do that?

792
00:32:38,637 --> 00:32:41,038
How do you get the President
of the United States

793
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,340
to commit to taking on Russia?

794
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:46,644
Make him think that he
was attacked by them.

795
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:49,313
Then he'll never allow

796
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:51,282
for any kind of aggression against Ukraine.

797
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:52,583
That's a huge swing.

798
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:55,119
Desperate times, desperate measures.

799
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:57,655
45. Third down.

800
00:32:57,656 --> 00:33:00,224
So... is it nuts?

801
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:01,492
Is it possible?

802
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:04,395
How long did it take the passengers to jump

803
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,163
after the plane got in trouble?

804
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:08,666
According to the black box,

805
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:09,800
uh, 48 seconds.

806
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:11,401
Were there any fatalities?

807
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:14,371
And how banged up were they?

808
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:17,408
The report gave no indication

809
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:19,276
that any of the passengers were injured.

810
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:21,479
Well, that's interesting.

811
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,748
When I was doing parachute training,

812
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:26,283
everybody always had something
on their first couple of jumps.

813
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:27,284
Cuts, bruises,

814
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:28,853
sprains, even a couple of fractures.

815
00:33:28,854 --> 00:33:30,221
And this was a bunch of Marines

816
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:31,555
in top physical condition

817
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:32,823
jumping out of a stable plane.

818
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:35,024
Not a bunch of diplomats
bailing from a nosedive.

819
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,367
Nice hit, Jace!

820
00:33:48,105 --> 00:33:50,174
Great play, Panthers!

821
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:53,109
They stopped a potential touchdown drive.

822
00:33:57,815 --> 00:33:59,316
- Hi.
- What do you want?

823
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:00,985
I need your help.

824
00:34:00,986 --> 00:34:03,154
I'll ask you again.

825
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:04,655
What do you want?

826
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:06,957
You went to Ukraine

827
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,626
to meet with Bozek and his staff

828
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:11,228
directly after the incident
with their plane, right?

829
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:12,997
The day after. Yes.

830
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:15,566
What kind of physical shape were they in?

831
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,734
Fine.

832
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:21,338
Cuts, sprains, bruises?

833
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:22,506
Any kind of injuries?

834
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,341
Bozek had a small laceration

835
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:25,509
on the side of his face.

836
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,144
Otherwise, not a mark on them that I saw

837
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:28,345
or that anyone mentioned.

838
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:30,214
Huh.

839
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:31,415
You're not doubting

840
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:32,616
that the crash happened?

841
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:34,451
There's documentation.

842
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:35,753
They found the wreckage.

843
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:37,688
- I'm not doubting that.
- Then what?

844
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:39,857
You didn't come all the way over here

845
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:41,792
to ask me how they looked.

846
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,928
Actually, I did.

847
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:46,596
Thanks, Craig.

848
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:51,569
I know you have a
wrathful grudge against me

849
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,270
that you might well take to your grave

850
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:55,135
and we are never going to see eye to eye

851
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,651
about what transpired,

852
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:59,643
but I do know one thing about you.

853
00:34:59,644 --> 00:35:01,545
First and foremost, you're a patriot.

854
00:35:01,546 --> 00:35:03,980
I really do wish you well.

855
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:15,993
Wow.

856
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:18,095
You guys look like you've
been here all night.

857
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:19,663
Well, because they've been here all night.

858
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:22,166
I was going for sarcasm.

859
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,133
Oh, sorry.

860
00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:24,427
I've been here all night, too.

861
00:35:24,428 --> 00:35:25,803
So what have we got?

862
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:28,072
Matt has a friend in Defense.

863
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:29,340
Matt has a friend?

864
00:35:29,341 --> 00:35:31,041
In the Defense Department.

865
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:32,576
None of my jokes are landing.

866
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:34,678
Must be the sleep deprivation.

867
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,121
So my friend in Defense

868
00:35:36,122 --> 00:35:38,782
somehow got his hands on the manifest

869
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:41,117
for that Ukrainian flight.

870
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:43,988
Both versions.

871
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:44,955
Both?

872
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:46,156
Two days before the flight,

873
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:48,792
the entire passenger roster list changed.

874
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:51,379
The original list was just
his usual inner sanctum.

875
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,364
But suddenly, the guest list changed

876
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:54,632
to include seemingly random

877
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:56,000
members of his staff.

878
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:57,201
"Seemingly."

879
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:58,569
What's the connective tissue?

880
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,271
Everyone on board the plane,

881
00:36:00,272 --> 00:36:01,405
including Bozek,

882
00:36:01,406 --> 00:36:03,307
was a former officer in the Ukrainian Army.

883
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:04,441
All with hundreds of hours

884
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:07,111
of paratroop training and experience.

885
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:11,115
Wow.

886
00:36:11,116 --> 00:36:12,283
What are the odds?

887
00:36:12,284 --> 00:36:13,651
There are no odds.

888
00:36:13,652 --> 00:36:14,985
Ma'am.

889
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:16,287
We're just getting a report

890
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:18,989
that a man has died in
a Vietnamese hospital

891
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,157
of polonium poisoning.

892
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:21,625
What?

893
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:26,096
The, uh, alpha particle
signature off his body

894
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:28,532
indicates that it's polonium-210.

895
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:32,803
That's the same kind that
was used to kill George Lasko.

896
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:34,171
Where was this man from?

897
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:36,674
Ukraine.

898
00:36:36,675 --> 00:36:38,475
Specifically, an agent

899
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:41,011
with their Foreign Intelligence Service.

900
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:44,014
A man named Sasha Marchuk.

901
00:36:44,015 --> 00:36:47,651
He spent two days trying to
secure a flight out of Cambodia,

902
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:51,388
but was denied because of his
grave and indeterminate illness.

903
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:55,125
He finally staggered into
a hospital in Biên Hoa

904
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,260
where he admitted

905
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:58,362
that he was suffering
from polonium poisoning.

906
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:00,431
By then, it was too late.

907
00:37:00,432 --> 00:37:02,800
He died of liver failure
just a few hours ago.

908
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:04,535
I don't understand.

909
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:05,703
Who is he?

910
00:37:05,704 --> 00:37:07,338
He's the person

911
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:08,806
who hired the hacker,

912
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,107
George Lasko,

913
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:11,909
and then killed him

914
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,444
to cover the tracks.

915
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:15,312
But polonium is a tricky murder weapon

916
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:17,881
and he accidentally poisoned himself.

917
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:19,984
You're saying the Ukrainians

918
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:21,385
were behind the cyber attack

919
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:22,720
on Air Force One.

920
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:24,188
What would they possibly have to gain?

921
00:37:24,189 --> 00:37:26,590
President Bozek was panicked
about Russian aggression

922
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:28,859
and he knew Ukraine could
never stand up to them

923
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,127
without international aid.

924
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:32,629
So he decided to take
matters into his own hands.

925
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,432
He sought out Lasko and
gave him countless resources

926
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:38,168
to develop his malware
and hack Air Force One.

927
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:40,671
He figured we'd blame Russia

928
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:42,406
and get pulled into the conflict.

929
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:43,941
But when we didn't take the bait,

930
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:46,210
he followed up with an appeal to join NATO.

931
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:48,645
His request was denied,

932
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:50,748
so he escalated the ruse.

933
00:37:50,749 --> 00:37:52,716
He uploaded fake financial records

934
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,485
onto Lasko's laptop,

935
00:37:54,486 --> 00:37:57,321
transactions pointing back to Russian GRU.

936
00:37:57,322 --> 00:37:58,922
And then he attacked his own plane?

937
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:00,290
Yes, sir.

938
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:03,861
He covered for the lives of the passengers

939
00:38:03,862 --> 00:38:07,164
by replacing officials

940
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:09,432
with trained paratroopers.

941
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:13,070
That was the final piece of the puzzle.

942
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:14,571
We just found it.

943
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:16,739
It wasn't Russia.

944
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:20,411
We were duped, Mr. President.

945
00:38:20,412 --> 00:38:23,079
It was Bozek all along.

946
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,255
Mr. President,

947
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:39,080
I could not be more at a loss.

948
00:38:39,081 --> 00:38:42,115
Mikhail, believe me when I tell you

949
00:38:42,116 --> 00:38:43,817
this will go much better for you

950
00:38:43,818 --> 00:38:45,784
if you dispense with this approach.

951
00:38:51,758 --> 00:38:54,361
My parents and grandparents

952
00:38:54,362 --> 00:38:58,365
suffered countless horrors
at the hands of the Russians.

953
00:38:58,366 --> 00:39:01,234
I was not going to let
Ukraine be swallowed up

954
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:03,169
by the Russian monster once again.

955
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,505
I resolved to do

956
00:39:05,506 --> 00:39:06,673
everything in my power,

957
00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:08,308
from risking my life

958
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:09,776
to risking yours, Mr. President,

959
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:13,446
to preserve my country's independence.

960
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:14,981
I would do it again.

961
00:39:14,982 --> 00:39:17,684
Well, luckily for you,

962
00:39:17,685 --> 00:39:19,653
this scheme of yours

963
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:21,987
has put us all in the same box.

964
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:26,826
If we reveal the deception,

965
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:28,928
Russia will hit you
with everything it's got,

966
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:31,463
killing millions of innocent people.

967
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:34,567
And a wordless pulling out of troops

968
00:39:34,568 --> 00:39:36,469
makes us look weak,

969
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,838
exposing you to the same outcome.

970
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:41,474
So, for the time being,

971
00:39:41,475 --> 00:39:44,611
we are maintaining our presence

972
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:47,681
and enforcing our no-fly
zone over Ukrainian airspace.

973
00:39:47,682 --> 00:39:50,250
40 million Ukrainians

974
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:51,751
don't deserve to get slaughtered

975
00:39:51,752 --> 00:39:53,952
because of what you did.

976
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:58,525
Thank you.

977
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:02,127
And my people thank you
for your great mercy.

978
00:40:04,297 --> 00:40:05,932
Let's be clear.

979
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:09,803
If you breathe one word of this to anyone,

980
00:40:09,804 --> 00:40:12,972
we will expose you, capture you,

981
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:15,275
and throw you into the same dark hole

982
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:17,075
where we kept Noriega.

983
00:40:21,915 --> 00:40:23,950
Dude, he was coming across the line

984
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:25,452
like Beast Mode with a jet pack.

985
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:26,619
You came out of nowhere, dude.

986
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,054
He was dragging you and
trying to shake you off,

987
00:40:28,055 --> 00:40:29,222
but you wouldn't budge.

988
00:40:29,223 --> 00:40:31,224
Then he just tried to
fling you and he was down.

989
00:40:31,225 --> 00:40:32,759
Boom! I thought there was gonna be

990
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,960
nothing but a grease spot.

991
00:40:33,961 --> 00:40:35,527
The Secretary of State.

992
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:37,864
Oh, hey, Mom. The, uh...

993
00:40:37,865 --> 00:40:39,032
the guys brought pizza.

994
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:40,900
I know, it... it smells so good.

995
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:42,268
Don't let me interrupt.

996
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:44,537
- Your son is one crazy-ass
ball player, ma'am. - Dude!

997
00:40:44,538 --> 00:40:46,706
Yeah, I know.

998
00:40:46,707 --> 00:40:49,109
And now he's out for the season.

999
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,276
It's so sad.

1000
00:40:50,277 --> 00:40:51,311
She's not sad.

1001
00:40:51,312 --> 00:40:53,546
Not the least bit sad.

1002
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:55,215
But I'm glad you had a good game.

1003
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:57,462
Dude, you're totally coming back next year.

1004
00:40:57,463 --> 00:40:59,339
Oh, you know it, dude.

1005
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:04,428
Our son has a whole new
group of friends named Dude.

1006
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,702
They named him MVP of the game.

1007
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,004
Giving him a trophy.

1008
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:15,636
Wow. And I don't have to worry about him

1009
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:17,070
for a whole nother season.

1010
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:19,272
Oh, forget it.

1011
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:21,240
He's already told me
he's retiring his jersey.

1012
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:23,576
What?

1013
00:41:23,577 --> 00:41:25,611
He's talking about fencing now.

1014
00:41:25,612 --> 00:41:28,114
Swords.

1015
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:30,583
Fabulous.

1016
00:41:34,921 --> 00:41:36,856
Thank you for talking to me about things

1017
00:41:36,857 --> 00:41:38,391
that could have sent us to prison.

1018
00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:40,193
So you followed through on your theory?

1019
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:42,061
Oh, yes.

1020
00:41:42,062 --> 00:41:44,831
All the way to the president's office.

1021
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:47,867
World catastrophe avoided.

1022
00:41:47,868 --> 00:41:50,469
Still have to find a way

1023
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,572
to extricate the U.S. from Ukraine

1024
00:41:52,573 --> 00:41:54,407
without losing any more lives.

1025
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:57,343
Otherwise, they'll just
keep banging the drum

1026
00:41:57,344 --> 00:41:59,344
until someone fires a shot.

1027
00:42:00,546 --> 00:42:01,846
My asset's gone dark.

1028
00:42:02,949 --> 00:42:05,284
I don't know if he got
trapped in the blackout

1029
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:07,486
or he fled to Stockholm in time.

1030
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,521
I-I have no idea.

1031
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:10,722
Henry, I'm sorry.

1032
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:17,129
Why is Jason quitting football?

1033
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,264
Is it because of me?

1034
00:42:18,265 --> 00:42:19,866
Because if he's really good at it,

1035
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:21,868
then he should do it, even if it scares me.

1036
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:24,437
Uh, no, he's quitting
because it scares him.

1037
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:26,405
Believe me, he has nothing
more to prove there.

1038
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,344
Hello, Mr. President.

1039
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:36,849
Yes, sir.

1040
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,483
I'm on my way.

1041
00:42:43,923 --> 00:42:45,758
You're a praying man, right?

1042
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:47,625
I'll get St. Francis on it. He owes me.

1043
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:57,637
There's a development
over Ukrainian airspace.

1044
00:42:57,638 --> 00:42:59,872
The Russians just
violated the no-fly zone.

1045
00:42:59,873 --> 00:43:01,040
Half an hour ago.

1046
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:02,474
What does Ostrov say?

1047
00:43:02,475 --> 00:43:03,976
Nothing at all out of Moscow.

1048
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:05,378
They're not picking up the phone.

1049
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:06,979
The message is clear.

1050
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,282
They're not recognizing our authority.

1051
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:10,950
It's their show.

1052
00:43:10,951 --> 00:43:12,385
Then we have to be equally clear.

1053
00:43:12,386 --> 00:43:14,986
Our men are locked and
loaded, Mr. President.

1054
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:21,659
Just waiting for the order.

1055
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:29,534
Permission to engage, sir?

1056
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:38,095
Permission granted.

1057
