Usually, one chef cooks in the kitchen,
and others eat.

But here, everyone cooks for themselves.

The color wasn’t a match.

371
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,560
So, I added some food color to it.

372
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,400
I'm expecting Dev to
get a Michelin star too.

373
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,240
Chef.

374
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,480
Eggs.

375
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,880
What is he doing?

376
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,760
Something new!

377
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,880
He keeps adding
things without looking.

378
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,080
That's how he is. Write it down quickly.

379
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,840
It is a new recipe.

380
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,080
He knows Telugu?

381
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,440
You won’t get it another time.

382
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,720
Shut up and write quickly.

383
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,960
Okay. Bro...

384
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,160
Head chef!

385
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,080
He's cooking exactly like how Dev cooks.

386
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,920
I’ll see you tomorrow, guys.

387
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,120
Merry Christmas!

388
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,640
Oh, god! I can't believe
that it's already Christmas.

389
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,800
Merry Christmas!

390
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,480
What?

391
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,000
Open the door.

392
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,640
Open the door!

393
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,880
Anybody there?

394
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,560
Open the door!
Sandy! Rajesh!

395
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,840
Somebody, please open the door. Haven’t
I told you that the door gets jammed?

396
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,880
Did you not place the wedge?

397
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,920
Useless fellow!

398
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,240
You’re not good at anything.

399
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,760
Open the door!

400
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,960

Hello!

Are you guys there?

406
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,360
Hello!

407
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,800
Somebody open the door.

408
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,800
Anybody there?

Hello!

00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,880
Help.

Someone open the door!

Help?

Please.

[QUIVERING]

428
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,360
Hello!

429
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,040
How did you do it?

430
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,760
In hot water...

431
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,480
I just added whatever I
could get my hands on.

432
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:09,760
How?

433
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,160
Spring onions?

434
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:15,920
Yeah.

435
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,600
How much?

436
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,680
Whatever I got in my hand.

437
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,280
And next?

438
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,040
Ginger!

439
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,440
How much?

440
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,480
This much.

441
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,760
1?2?3?4?5

442
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,480
Maybe two more!

443
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,600
What the hell! How, Dev?

444
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,080
How do you do this?

445
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,320
How can you add without measuring?

446
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,720
I got used to it, Ms. Tara.

447
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,040
Ms. Tara!

448
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,400
Sorry.

449
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,400
My hand just moved automatically.

450
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,040
What’s wrong with you, Dev?

451
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,760
Sorry, Ms. Tara.

452
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,160
It happened unintentionally.

453
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,200
No!

454
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,680
I’m talking about this.

455
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,480
And you!

456
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,600
Your spasms!

457
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,280
What happened to you?

458
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,560
It has been like this for the past 5 years.

459
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,200
You talk to someone at times.

460
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,320
You gesture as if there’s
someone beside you.

461
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,760
Was I talking?

462
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,520
No.

463
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,520
In fact when the storage room door jammed,

464
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,200
you looked away and asked ‘what’!

465
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,040
What?
Hmm?

466
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,720
What’s happening?

467
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,880
Did I talk?

468
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,680
No.

469
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,480
Dev! Don’t lie.

470
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,120
What’s your problem?

471
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,440
Tell me.

472
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,840
Your expression says it all.

473
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,360
Will you tell me or not?

474
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Tell me, Dev.

475
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,760
I...
-Tell me!

476
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,240
I had a childhood friend.

477
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,520
We grew up together.

478
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,440
5 years ago...

479
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,680
She died.

480
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:26,000
And even though she is dead, I can see her.

481
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,240
She talks to me.

482
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,640
All of this happens to me because of her.

483
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,400
Is she here now?

484
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,600
Yeah.

485
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,320
She is beautiful, isn’t she?

486
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,960
Maya!

487
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,360
We lived like two souls in a single heart.

488
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:35,200
She’s filled in the most part of my world.

489
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,920
I’ve never known a world without her.

490
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,200
Our parents are family friends.

491
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,480
We were neighbors.

492
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,560
When I was 5?

493
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:50,840
Maya.

494
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,520
Maya.

495
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:53,720
Get up.

496
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,760
What?

497
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,000
Hush.

498
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,280
Calm down, dear.

499
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,080
Maya.

500
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,960
Okay?

501
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,600
Don’t cry. Okay?

502
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,120
Okay, sleep.

503
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,720
Did Maya come?

504
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,240
They both are sleeping.

505
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,720
So comfortably!

506
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,560
She cries if I take her.

507
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,520
She went back to sleep
as soon as he hugged her.

508
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,480
Don’t worry.

509
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,520
Let her sleep here.

510
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,720
I’ll take care.

511
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,960
Eat a little.

512
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,160
Just one.

513
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:53,880
Eat.

514
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,720
Eat.

515
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,720
Eat, dear.

516
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,280
Eat this.

517
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,000
Wait. I’ll be back.

518
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,520
She eats only if I cook.

519
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,440
I learned cooking for her.

520
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,200
She has changed my ways of cooking.

521
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,560
The thing she loved the most? Desserts.

522
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,160
One more.

523
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,240
Okay. Bye?

524
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:34,760
Okay.

525
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,120
I’ll see you in the morning.

526
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:36,960
Don’t forget.
Yeah!

527
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,960
Maya!

528
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,920
You go, mom.

529
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,200
I’ll sleep here.

530
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,120
Maya!

531
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,240
Maya! Come.

532
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,200
I won’t come.

533
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,320
I said come.

534
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,120
I’ll slap you.
I won’t come, mom.

535
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:51,560
Come.

536
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,160
I won’t come.
I said come.

537
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,360
Hey! Come.
Deva!

538
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,960
Mom! I won’t come.

539
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,920
Hey! Come here?

540
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,120
Akbar bhai! Good morning.

541
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,280
Good morning.

542
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,880
4 teas for me, please! And Vada too.

543
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,680
Okay, dear.

544
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,320
Your breakfast is ready!

545
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,080
Thank you.

546
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,720
Bye?
Bye?

547
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,720
No one takes responsibility.

548
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,000
I wanted to make this
the safest zone in India.

549
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,680
But, none of you work properly.

550
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,160
They want salaries on time.

551
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,440
See...

552
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,240
Aunty!

553
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,520
Good morning.
Good morning.

554
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,880
How are you able to wake up
early in the morning every day?

555
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,840
I’ll deduct salaries from next time.
- On a day like this?

556
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,120
How can I not wake up?

557
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,240
I wish your friend does the same.
Okay.

558
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,240
This is for you.

559
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,800
I’ll go and wake him up.

560
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,640
Do you understand?

561
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:00,760
Dev!

562
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,520
Wake up.

563
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:03,760
Dev! Wake up.

564
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,120
Wake up, Dev.

565
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,760
Dev! - Give me 2 minutes. I am sleepy.

566
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,840
See! I got tea for you.

567
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,760
I got tea for you.

568
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,000
Dev.

569
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:13,960

570
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:14,680
Devu.

575
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,560
Wake up.

576
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,800
Dev. See this.

577
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,840
My eyes are itchy Maya. Can’t open?

578
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,920
Wake up, Dev.

I am hungry.

01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,280
Cook something for me.

585
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,440
Why?

586
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,240
What big recipe?

587
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,920
Whatever it is,
will it be as good as how we make it?

588
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,040
Hi, darlings!

589
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,560
Nandu uncle!
Hi, uncle.

590
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,000
What’s special today?

591
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,600
Ancho Salmon!

592
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,520
Shall we eat?

593
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,040
Eating fish so damn early in the morning!

594
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,480
Serve me Sambar.

595
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,040
Dev! This is delicious.

596
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,920
Your place isn’t here.

597
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,120
There's a friend of mine in the UK.

598
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,800
Michelin star chef! - I’ll get more. Wait.

599
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,280
You'd gain a good
experience if you work for him.

600
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,320
Okay. First do a course
on hotel management,

601
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,720
We’ll do what’s needed after.

602
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,200
You’ll become a great chef, Dev.

603
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,200
Shut up, Nandu.

604
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,240
How can he cook like a woman?

605
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,280
What’s with man and woman there?

606
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,680
It’s not just that. Can’t
he find a good job.

607
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,040
Why do he think about
catering and hotel management?

608
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,360
He pursued M.com.
He should write bank exams.

609
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,720
Have you ever taste his dishes?
No need.

610
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,200
Maya.

611
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,200
Just one bite!

612
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,000
Maya.

613
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,120
Ogling at a random girl uh, Rascal?

614
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,440
Hey! Your dad will come through one day.

615
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,760
That’s not needed.

616
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,080
He let’s us be as we
are now, that’s enough.

617
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,360
No? There’s more in life

618
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,440
You can be so much happier

619
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,760
I think you’re wasting your life.

620
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,240
After a while,
your dad or no one will be around.

621
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,160
Everyone will leave someday.

622
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,280
And then, when you look
back to see the life you lived,

623
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,240
You’ll wonder if you lived for
yourself or for everyone else.

624
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:15,880
It won’t be good.

625
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,760
Whoever leaves, you’ll
be here with me right?

626
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,320
I won’t.

627
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,040
Only you’ll be there for yourself

628
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,600
Don’t change the topic.

629
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,920
Wake up early in the morning.

630
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,480
Enjoy the sunrise.

631
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,760

Cook what you like.

Eat till your stomach’s full.

634
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,320
Live your life the way you want to

635
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,160
Hey! What happened to you?

636
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,720
Why do you sound like a grandmother?

637
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,360
Get lost! I won’t say anything.

638
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,520
Hey?

639
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,360
“Your smile is all I need”

640
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,920

“No words can replace your lovely silence”

644

“Your appeal is sweet”

650

“My race never ends”

651
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,560
“When you get closer to me”

652
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,440
“Each color resembles mixed colors”

653
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,240
“Many thoughts arise in a jiffy”

654
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,960
“Your dialogues echo in my heart”

655
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,440
“These dreams are wayward”

656
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,320
“My sleep is bothered”

657
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,680

“Your smile is all I need”

661
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,200
Good morning.

662
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,480
Morning.

663
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:14,920
It’s good.

664
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,080
Is this from the same
teashop we usually buy from?

665
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:18,920
No.

666
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,280
Then?

667
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,960
This is what your son cooked yesterday.

668
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,640
It is all soft and cold now.

669
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:30,320
Imagine how good it would
be to eat it hot and fresh.

670
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,240
What was your childhood dream, uncle?

671
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,200
Was it your plan to do business,
To take care of the family,

672
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:48,280
Forget how to smile And drink
yourself to sleep every night?

673
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,520
Okay.

674
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,640
I’ll go and wake Dev up.

675
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,880
Whatever it is,
will it be as good as how we make it?

676
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,120
That?

677
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,040
What is that?

678
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,320
Scrambled eggs.
It is easy to make, mom.

679
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:35,960
What next?

680
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,200
Add pepper and oregano
to give it some Italian flavor.

681
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,600
This is one of our regular egg dishes.

682
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,480
By adding fancy things the
dish is named ‘Scrambled eggs!’.

683
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:56,200
Can I taste it?

684
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,600
This is so good, my son.

685
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,400
Do you want to pursue hotel management?

686
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:41,680
Yeah.

687
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,280
Go for it.

688
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,000
Do whatever you want.

689
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,200
Go wherever you want.

690
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,640
But, promise me that you’d always be happy.

691
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,240
I am sorry, boy.

692
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,200
You reminded me of my mom’s cooking.

693
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,600
What are you saying, dad?

694
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:03,800
Sorry.

What is it?

01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,200
What happened?

I love you, Maya.

We’ll celebrate Christmas there.

snowfall one or two days.

I am hungry.

01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,560
Can you cook something for me?

727
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,480
Dev! Whatever you’re
experiencing is a hallucination.

728
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,000
You are just imagining it.

729
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,440
Fool! You’re the imagination

730

01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:15,840
Cry!

748
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,720
For her peace, you need to let her go.

749
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,680
Listen, Dev! You’ve grown up together.
- Look at me.

750
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,760
Look at me. - But, she’s no more.

751
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,160
See! - You miss her.

752
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,760
That’s the only reason.
Dev.

753
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,200
There is a treatment for this. - See, Dev.

754
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,400
I’ll prescribe medicines. - Look at me.

755
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,560
You don’t worry. - Dev.

756
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,880
You’ll be alright, Dev. - Dev.

757
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,400
You’ll be alright.

758
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,240
Dev.

759
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,320
Deva.

760
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,360
Devu.

761
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,600
Deva.

762
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,000
Look at me, Dev.

763
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,600
Look at me.

764
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:53,480
They said that the seizures and
insomnia were the side effects

765
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,400
To the treatments

766
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,680
They gave me sleeping pills.

767
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,960
But, even those didn’t work.

768
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:08,040
The truth is?Maya has always been with me.

769
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:15,160
She gets on me, plays with me.
She jumps and tickles me.

770
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:16,920
She’s there.

771
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:27,640
It’s only me who ignores
her and behaves like she isn’t.

772
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,800
Oh no?

773
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:37,640
Am I dead? Why have you killed me?

774
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,400
Why have you killed me?

775
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,840
Oh no?

776
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,720
Even now,
she’s shocked to know that she is dead.

777
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:46,640
She is crying.

778
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:54,480
Oh no?
She is laughing at me.

779
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,120
Do I look insane?

780
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,160
Only now you make sense.

781
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,480
She’s a good girl.

782
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,880
A little arrogant, but good girl.

783
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,720
Are you feeling cold?

784
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:30,040
I searched for it,
but couldn’t find anything to cover.

785
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,320
That’s fine, Dev.

786
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,400
Hey! She has OCD.

787
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:43,640
Let it be.

788
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:56,160
Dev! So have you not
slept at all for 5 years?

789
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,520
Dev.

790
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:58,480
Devu.

791
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,400
Deva.

792
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,280
Okay. Tell me something about Maya.

793
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,680
[MAYA, DEV]: What about Maya?

794
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,240
What does Maya like?

795
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,960
What do you like about her?

796
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:24,440
Maya!

797
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:44,680
“You’re the only one I
need when I am weary”

798
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,000
“All the weariness shall disappear”

799
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:52,160
“My rigidity vanishes in a flash”

800
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:58,480
“My heart that listens to
your voice knows no thoughts”

801
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:02,040
“Dreams are mysterious”

802
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,960
“You’re my dream story”

803
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,320
“The world around fades”

804
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,640
“My heart gleams”

805
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,840
“In your magical trance”

806
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,120
“In your magical trance”

807
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,280
“The world around me changes”

808
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,680
“Like a endless smear”

809
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,520
“In your magical trance”

810
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:54,000
“In your magical trance”

811
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:28,120
I want to eat something.

812
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,520
Will you cook something for me?

813
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,240
Dessert?

814
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,800
She’s copying me.

815
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,680
She’s copying me.

816
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,960
I guess she likes you.

817
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,120
Did you see it? She copied me.

818
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,480
What should I cook?

819
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,440
Cook whatever Maya likes.

820
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,880
What are you doing?

821
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,400
Isn’t it good?

822
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,760
Do something a bit more romantic.

823
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,040
Add some strawberries and all.

824
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,320
When you look at it,
it’ll look all romantic!

825
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,680
The best part is the strawberries.

826
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,760
Teach me how to cook like you, Dev.

827
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,080
Is everything okay?

828
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,760
Something is missing.

829
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:16,800
Exactly!

830
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,000
That’s when we improvise.

831
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:27,120
Do you remember
everything you smelt earlier?

832
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,160
Hmm?

833
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,200
Hmm.

834
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,520
Guess what would be good added to this?

835
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,120
Garlic!

836
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,480
Perfect.

837
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:48,880
This is my cooking.

838
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,880
I’ll go get some wine.

839
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,040
What’s your favorite color?

840
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,280
White and green!

841
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,280
How about you?

842
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,160
Red and black!

843
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,360
Favorite music?

844
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,440
Raja sir.

845
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,080
Same here.

846
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,560
90’s-Rahman too!

847
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:40,840
Yeah.

848
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:41,480
Food?

849
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:42,600
Italian.

850
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,320
And Indian-Chinese when I’m bored.

851
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:47,280
How about you?

852
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,560
Ghee Spicy Crepe!

853
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:49,720
Idli with gravy!

854
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,760
Steamed Ragi with Chicken curry!

855
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,680
Ulavacharu Biryani!

856
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,280
My list is lengthy.

857
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:59,200
Nice.

858
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,600
Did you work somewhere earlier?

859
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:06,480
Not much! I worked at
Taj Deccan in Hyderabad.

860
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,480
I worked for a few
months at Novotel in Vizag.

861
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,440
That means you’re quite experienced.

862
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:12,680
And you?

863
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,240
This is my first job.

864
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,040
Is it?

865
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,880
I got here through some recommendation.

866
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:17,760
I know.

867
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,440
I heard that you're
related to the head chef.

868
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,400
Do you love the beach?

869
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,200
I’m full.

870
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,320
Yeah! I’m full too.

871
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,080
Thanks.

872
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:48,760
Huh?

873
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,880
Just? thanks.

874
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,840
She’s getting emotional.

875
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:58,160
Ask her something.
She’ll tell you the truth.

876
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,600
What should I ask?

877
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,200
Hmm?

878
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,200
Ask her about her mother.
Try it.

879
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,880
Your mother?

880
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:08,800
Mother?

881
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,880
Ask about her father.

882
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,360
Father?

883
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,200
Father?

884
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:17,640
What about my father?

885
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,000
Goal!

886
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,760
Don’t take me wrong.

887
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,080
What do your parents do?

888
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:42,040
My parents got separated when I was 8.

889
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,880
Didn’t I tell you that she
would tell you the truth?

890
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,560
Mom took me far away from my dad.

891
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:57,160
So far away that she even
changed the name he gave me.

892
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:05,680
I feel proud whenever
I hear things about him.

893
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:13,080
But now,
I feel sad that he isn’t doing all that.

894
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:25,160
I want to see him turn
back to what he was earlier.

895
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,920
That’s why I fought with
my mom and came here.

896
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,400
Searching for my father

897
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,480
Searching for him and?

898
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,760
Did you find him?

899
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,320
Almost!

900
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,280
Why do you cook?

901
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,480
Dad used to cook a dish when I was young.

902
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,920
Gold-crusted fish it was called!

903
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:03,960
It’s the best thing ever.

904
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,200
My favorite dish.

905
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,160
I want to taste that dish.

906
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,120
Maybe, I started cooking to taste that.

907
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:20,360
I somehow feel that I may taste it again,
if I just keep cooking like him.

908
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:23,960
That’s it.

909
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:28,440
Amara?

910
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:15,560
Hey!

911
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,320
Dev

912
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,240
Dev! I am sorry.

913
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:22,520
I don’t know what happened to me.

914
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,000
You go?

915
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,080
You go, Dev.

916
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,520
Dev! I am sorry.

917
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,480
Dev! I am sorry.

918
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,240
Hey, Dev.

919
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,480
I’ll get another bottle of wine.

920
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:11,840
Devu...

921
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:17,520
Deva...

922
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,160
Deva...

923
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,160
Deva...Deva...

924
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,440
Ugh!

925
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,400
['Mandapeta Malakpeta '
song from 'Premikudu' playing]

926
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:38,480
“My life is twitchy”

927
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:42,240
“My heart is scarce”

928
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:45,960
“What sort of magic is this?”

929
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:50,320
“Not even a moment is steady”

930
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:53,440
“Time never ends”

931
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,320
“Sliding into my dreams”

932
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,880

Dev has had a cardiac
arrest due to overexertion.

He’s in a critical condition.

If this goes on, he can get another attack.

1017

So, he should eat less.
