1
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:45,478
That was a rocking act,
ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:49,074
We have two more acts to go
in the Dance Dil Se finals...

3
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,410
but before that...

4
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,923
let's give it up for such
a brilliant performance everybody!

5
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,887
Hello everybody!
l'm your host, Manish Paul.

6
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,361
And a very warm welcome to all of you.

7
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:07,264
This is no ordinary show.

8
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:13,332
This show decides
the best dancers in the country!

9
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:20,541
This is the grand finale of
most awaited Close up Dance Dil Se...

10
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,915
powered by Spinz!

11
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:28,279
After the break you will see...

12
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:30,450
last year's winning team on the stage.

13
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,655
And l can see that they are
the favourites this year too!

14
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,993
Yes... the defending champions.

15
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:38,362
Put your hands together for...

16
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:41,334
Jehangir Dance Company!

17
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,039
JDC! JDC!

18
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:53,076
Congratulations Jehangir!

19
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,306
The audience is already yours!

20
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,251
And soon the trophy will be mine too.

21
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:00,983
Why don't you go in and...

22
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:02,382
give a boost to your dancers.

23
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:06,393
l'd rather stay here
and boost the show's ratings.

24
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,621
Vishnu will give them a boost.

25
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:08,822
Yes, that's him!

26
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,263
The choreographer of the winning team.

27
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:12,493
And l'm going to meet him.

28
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,463
Okay, he is on his way.

29
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:16,526
Let's go!

30
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,341
Nervous?

31
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:23,609
Yeah!

32
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:24,406
Of course.

33
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,537
lt's normal.

34
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:26,308
Sir...

35
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,848
l've seen Lawrence's team rehearse.

36
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,851
They are really good.

37
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,285
Rhea, focus on your act.

38
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:33,912
Don't worry!

39
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,354
Sir, you are on in one minute.

40
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,412
Wow... one minute.

41
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:38,049
Are you ready?

42
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:39,385
1... 2...

43
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:56,288
Superb.

44
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:58,257
What a performance!

45
00:06:58,326 --> 00:07:00,487
Mind blowing, that was.

46
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:04,825
After watching the performance
by Lawrence's team...

47
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:09,359
l'm sure it will be difficult
for ourjudges to decide.

48
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:21,943
And the winners of Close Up
Dance Dil Se powered by Spinz are...

49
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:27,381
And the winner is...

50
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,747
any guesses?

51
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,822
Come on, any guesses?

52
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,689
Lawrence! Lawrence!

53
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,490
The winner is...

54
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:42,297
Jehangir Dance Company!

55
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,711
JDC! JDC!

56
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:09,593
Lovely!

57
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:12,091
Thank you.

58
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,695
Hello sir.

59
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:15,963
Nice lipstick.

60
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,228
Vishnu...

61
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:20,365
We did it!

62
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,602
We need to talk, Jehangir!

63
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:24,872
l am sorry!

64
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:26,641
What are you sorry for?

65
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,614
We won.
Nothing else matters.

66
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:30,742
lt does matter, Jehangir!

67
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,753
We won but we are not the best.

68
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:35,915
Lawrence's team was better than us.

69
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,356
l don't think we'll win next time.

70
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:39,483
Vishnu... you know what...

71
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,994
you are...

72
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:42,990
very innocent!

73
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:45,961
Do you think...

74
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:47,399
a dance competition...

75
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:49,698
is only about good choreography?

76
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:53,537
You mean we cheated?

77
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:57,339
Well, if it's only dance...

78
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,607
we don't deserve to win.

79
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:02,878
Dance is not the only criteria here.

80
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:06,682
Dance is not the only criteria
in Dance Dil Se?

81
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,654
lt's a show, Vishnu!

82
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:12,250
The only criteria here is
what the audience likes...

83
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:13,521
and the audience loves us.

84
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,688
You know why?
Because l make them...

85
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:18,289
Love us!

86
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,758
You teach 50 students in your class.

87
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:25,738
But there is an entirely
different world outside JDC...

88
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:28,503
where l make scores of people
dance to my tune.

89
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:32,244
l know, you like winning.

90
00:09:33,748 --> 00:09:37,445
You must be happy
with your work but...

91
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:39,451
l am not!

92
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,010
Why don't you take a break.

93
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:43,017
What?

94
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:44,350
l mean, take a break.

95
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:48,555
Since we started JDC
you've been working tirelessly.

96
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,530
l think you should take some rest.

97
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:52,862
ln fact, l'm going to make life
easier for you.

98
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:55,535
That's more like it!

99
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,733
We have won!

100
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,764
Okay!

101
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:03,469
But this party is not
for tonight's victory!

102
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:05,273
That's in the past.

103
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:08,044
This party is for our future.

104
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,944
The point is...

105
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:13,385
do you want to see the future?

106
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:17,315
Here it is.

107
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:21,057
Please join me in welcoming
a very dear friend...

108
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:23,856
all the way from New York...

109
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:25,763
Chris Donovan!

110
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:37,401
lt gives me immense pleasure...

111
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,576
and am utterly proud
to announce that...

112
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,913
Chris is going to be...

113
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:47,315
the new...

114
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,686
official...

115
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:51,316
choreographer of JDC.

116
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,327
Welcome Chris.

117
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,840
As far as administrative work and
other stuff is concerned...

118
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:11,675
you can rely on your dear Vishnu Sir.

119
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:16,010
Please make do in the
accounts department today...

120
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:19,014
l'll give you your
own swanky cabin soon.

121
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:20,880
Okay?

122
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,722
What do you mean?

123
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,281
What will l do in a cabin?

124
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:25,815
Administration!

125
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,418
l'm making you the admin manager!

126
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:30,987
There is only one
thing that l can do.

127
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,329
And that is dance!

128
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:36,299
Now that Chris is here,
both of us can...

129
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:37,599
No!

130
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:39,037
Chris doesn't work with anyone.

131
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,002
That was his condition.

132
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:44,072
Vishnu, please understand!

133
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:45,438
What?

134
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,470
Make him understand.

135
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:51,008
This is my studio.

136
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,483
Let's go...

137
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:56,523
to my cabin and talk.

138
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,786
Why not here?

139
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,388
Let's talk here.

140
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,288
Fine!

141
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,399
Vishnu, we need to change with time.

142
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,707
l am sorry to say...

143
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:18,012
your style is, you know... ancient.

144
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,504
lt's my duty to train my students...

145
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:22,640
according to the
modern international dance styles.

146
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:24,275
That's what l'm doing.

147
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,283
Right now JDC needs Chris, not you!

148
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:31,791
So you took this decision on your own?

149
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:39,555
This school is mine as much as yours.

150
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,696
What?

151
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:48,939
Can't you read?

152
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:51,842
What's written there?

153
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,542
Jehangir Dance Company.

154
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:55,639
JDC.

155
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:56,580
J for Jehangir.

156
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,549
That's me!

157
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:58,744
Standing right here.

158
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:04,355
You're here because of me, Vishnu!

159
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:06,825
l made the company what it is.

160
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:09,692
My name is on every brick
of this school.

161
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:13,932
Even yourjacket says JDC.

162
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:16,665
lt's time you realise this...

163
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:18,932
you don't work with me.

164
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,270
You work for me!

165
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,308
Worked!

166
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,506
l used to work here,
not anymore.

167
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:32,442
Really?

168
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,387
What good are you then?

169
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:43,730
Whatever you have belongs to me...
your house, car, everything.

170
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:48,530
You can't stay on
the streets of Mumbai!

171
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:53,831
What will you do?

172
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,710
You said it...

173
00:13:57,812 --> 00:14:01,475
there's an entirely
different world outside JDC.

174
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:30,033
Do you know how
sugarcane juice is extracted?

175
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:31,370
Jehangir is like the...

176
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,913
machine that extracts sugarcane juice.

177
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:36,745
He squeezes the life out of people.

178
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,978
Before you realise it...

179
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,918
he's squeezed you dry
and dropped you.

180
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:42,979
That's what he's done to you.

181
00:14:43,558 --> 00:14:46,322
Listen, Vishnu!

182
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,286
l still remember the old days.

183
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,957
l had once told you...

184
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:56,902
for me dance is life,
it's what water is to fish.

185
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:58,939
But l gave it up.

186
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,402
l mean, l was forced to.

187
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,704
Just because l put on
a little weight, l was fired.

188
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,247
Just a few pounds.

189
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,942
But l'm glad,
l never liked him anyway.

190
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:10,449
Jehangir's ajerk!

191
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:12,816
Now l am the master
of my own destiny.

192
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,650
Full respect!

193
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:16,815
Everyone knows me.

194
00:15:16,891 --> 00:15:21,590
l'm not rich, but it doesn't matter.

195
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:25,624
l am very happy and content.

196
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,258
What are your plans now?.

197
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:29,667
l'm going back to Chennai.

198
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:31,796
Are you crazy?

199
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,897
lt's all over now.

200
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,868
There is nothing here for me.

201
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,738
l'm leaving in two days.

202
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:43,846
l'm staying at a hotel close by.

203
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:45,317
Hotel?

204
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,751
You've forgotten the meaning
of friendship because of Jehangir.

205
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,687
- No...
- Then?

206
00:15:49,757 --> 00:15:51,486
How can you stay in a hotel?

207
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,323
l may not be rich,
but l have a big heart.

208
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:56,522
You're staying here, that's it!

209
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:59,756
l don't want to hear another word.

210
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,531
Let me get you something to eat.

211
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:32,391
Come on...

212
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:33,524
Run!

213
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:36,325
Stop it!

214
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:37,567
Get hold of him!

215
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:39,003
He's up there!

216
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:46,276
He's jumping around like a monkey!

217
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,316
Stop it!

218
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,785
Get back here...

219
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:03,429
After him!

220
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:06,659
Come on...

221
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:21,777
Grab him...

222
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,655
What's up, good looking?

223
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:31,817
Not now, dude!

224
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:32,790
Why don't you talk to me?

225
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,690
l'll call later!

226
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:02,244
Stop it!

227
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,294
What are you doing?

228
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:15,630
Who the hell are they?

229
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:17,735
Stop it!

230
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:19,237
Be careful...

231
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:26,304
Hey Gopi...

232
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,412
Who are you?

233
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,881
Are the cops still there?

234
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,440
l'm beat!

235
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,953
l saw her...

236
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:36,453
she looked fabulous!

237
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:37,889
The cops are still down there.

238
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,016
That was close!

239
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,591
Who is he?

240
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:42,419
Doesn't look like Gopi to me!

241
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,485
But where is Gopi?

242
00:18:43,564 --> 00:18:44,496
How should l know?.

243
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:47,329
Gopi is here.

244
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,995
When l tell you to practice,
you disappear.

245
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:52,296
But you come to me
when the cops are after you.

246
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:54,500
Oh come on... you're our darling!

247
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:56,440
Enough!

248
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,705
Don't you act smart!

249
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:00,678
Don't lose your cool.

250
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:01,680
Calm down!

251
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:03,239
Shut up!

252
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:05,615
Whatever you are doing is wrong!

253
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,678
l've lost weight running after you.

254
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:11,281
All of you should be locked
somewhere to practice.

255
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,223
We've practiced hard.

256
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:14,454
Tell him, Sushi.

257
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,927
From the bottom of our heart.

258
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:18,328
Time to use your hands
and feet too!

259
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,764
We swear...

260
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:21,495
if we don't set the stage on fire...

261
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,560
then you can do whatever you want.

262
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,369
What a line.

263
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,634
l'll impress Mamta with it.

264
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,405
''lf l don't set you on fire...

265
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,513
Laugh all you want...

266
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,384
but if you miss a single step,
you will regret it.

267
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:39,749
We won't.

268
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,550
You can tell Vardha Bhai...

269
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:44,490
that we will set the stage on fire.

270
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:48,858
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's welcome Vardha Bhai...

271
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:51,420
and here he is... Applause!

272
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:00,804
Sit, Gopi.

273
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,343
Vardha bhai, this is Vishnu.

274
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,536
And this is Vardha bhai.

275
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:10,743
Put it out!

276
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,036
Get some water!

277
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,617
Vishnu!

278
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,790
Hey Vishnu!

279
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:32,323
The boys said that they'd
set the stage on fire...

280
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:34,299
and they kept their word.

281
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:37,702
15 days of hard work
gone up in flames.

282
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,735
15 days? That's it?

283
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:44,934
15 years of my life
have gone up in smoke.

284
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:50,312
That's no reason to be sad.
ls that why you got the long face?

285
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,514
Have a drink and let it go.

286
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:54,986
How can l let go?

287
00:21:55,589 --> 00:22:02,757
15 years ago l came
to Mumbai with a dream.

288
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:06,396
Not a grand dream.

289
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:10,601
l didn't dream of flying.

290
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,932
All l wanted was...

291
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:16,906
to make a mark for myself.

292
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:20,470
But my destiny was paved with rocks.

293
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:22,375
But l tried.

294
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,510
l spent 15 years carving
a name on those rocks.

295
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:36,028
But now l've realised it
wasn't my name.

296
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:38,422
Vishnu!
Don't say that.

297
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:41,491
l know where you stand.

298
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,298
You have achieved a lot.

299
00:22:44,371 --> 00:22:47,932
And l will tell the world
about your achievements.

300
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:50,670
You down there...

301
00:22:50,778 --> 00:22:52,473
people of the world.

302
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,446
lt's me, Gopi...
up here.

303
00:22:56,884 --> 00:23:00,786
With me, is the world's richest man.

304
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:02,880
My pal...

305
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,685
Vishnu!

306
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:11,354
He might not be famous.

307
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:14,595
He might not be a millionaire.

308
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:16,431
But he is rich because...

309
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:19,302
he has a friend...

310
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:21,038
me!

311
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:24,739
That good-for-nothing-scoundrel
Jehangir...

312
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:26,904
may have his name carved on rocks.

313
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,847
But your name will be
carved in everyone's heart.

314
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:31,848
l guarantee you.

315
00:23:32,553 --> 00:23:35,989
Until your dream
becomes a reality...

316
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:37,819
you cannot leave.

317
00:23:37,891 --> 00:23:38,880
Hold on...

318
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:45,297
Chennai...

319
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,297
sorry, Chennai!

320
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,994
Gopi, no, no...

321
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:50,559
please, Gopi... no...

322
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,298
Gopi... yes!

323
00:23:55,676 --> 00:23:58,406
Vishnu, tomorrow we bid
farewell to Lord Ganpati.

324
00:23:58,512 --> 00:24:00,241
Ganpati is going.

325
00:24:00,514 --> 00:24:03,483
And when Ganpati leaves,
he's benevolent.

326
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:07,987
So, open your heart
and wipe away those tears.

327
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:10,783
Vishnu...

328
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:16,624
Lord Ganpati will shower
his blessings on you.

329
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:22,530
Ganpati Bappa... morya!

330
00:27:59,953 --> 00:28:01,682
You jerk!

331
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,280
Move it!

332
00:28:41,395 --> 00:28:42,885
Move it!

333
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:08,718
The cops are here! Run!

334
00:29:58,271 --> 00:29:59,397
Vishnu...

335
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:01,399
Vishnu...

336
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,934
What's the matter?

337
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,500
Say something.

338
00:30:06,947 --> 00:30:10,314
God made this world.

339
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:14,780
He created the plants and animals...

340
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:17,584
What's with the Biology lecture?

341
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:18,658
Listen...

342
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:20,556
God made this world.

343
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,457
He created the plants...

344
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,689
l get it.

345
00:30:23,763 --> 00:30:26,288
Plants and animals.

346
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:26,957
So?

347
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,433
And then he gave them dance.

348
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:32,604
Leaves dance in the breeze.

349
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:36,403
Rivers flow to a rhythm.

350
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:39,877
Fish swimming, birds flying...

351
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:43,506
dance is everywhere.

352
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:44,515
Right?

353
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:45,744
Whoa!

354
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,388
That's way over my head.

355
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:54,586
Dance is the sign of life, Gopi.

356
00:30:55,862 --> 00:31:00,424
Anything that moves
to the beat of nature...

357
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,292
signifies life.

358
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:04,667
Anything that is alive can dance...

359
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:06,898
the dead don't dance!

360
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:11,440
Everyone around here...

361
00:31:11,945 --> 00:31:13,537
is dead.

362
00:31:13,947 --> 00:31:16,677
They are like machines.

363
00:31:17,517 --> 00:31:20,418
But their eyes light up with life...

364
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:22,318
when they dance.

365
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:23,981
l have seen it.

366
00:31:24,057 --> 00:31:24,989
At the Ganpati farewell.

367
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:27,424
That wasn't dance.

368
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:29,359
They were fighting.

369
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,394
l agree...

370
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:32,965
but this fight,
this spirit of competition...

371
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:35,593
can transform their life.

372
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:37,560
Get it?

373
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:39,669
Not a word.

374
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:43,334
Tearing up my ticket was
a blessing in disguise.

375
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:48,407
l guess Ganpati wanted me
to leave JDC in order to come here.

376
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:51,608
The kids here need me more...

377
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,586
than at JDC.

378
00:31:53,653 --> 00:31:55,621
These kids don't need anyone.

379
00:31:56,356 --> 00:31:58,256
What will you do with them?

380
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:01,021
l'll tell you what l'll do...

381
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,353
l'll teach them dance.

382
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:04,552
Mark my words...

383
00:32:04,664 --> 00:32:07,827
the kids in this neighbourhood
have a real shot at making it big.

384
00:32:10,003 --> 00:32:12,972
l'm not sure about that but...

385
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:14,570
l think you're losing it...

386
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:18,542
like that character, Bhuvan,
from the movie Lagaan.

387
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:20,745
You know something...

388
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:25,645
l think you should go back home.

389
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:28,688
Sorry, Chennai,
Vishnu is coming.

390
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:29,779
Gopi!

391
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,958
l'm not going anywhere.

392
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:35,993
l will teach dance...

393
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:40,055
to every single one of them.

394
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,494
Whose boat is this?

395
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:42,761
lt's our boat.

396
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:43,927
Gopi?

397
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,335
Gopi?

398
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:47,368
Take a look.

399
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,305
Are you trying to burn us?

400
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:50,400
No, Vardha bhai...

401
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,602
lt's fireproof!

402
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:52,905
You can try all you want
but it won't catch fire.

403
00:32:52,979 --> 00:32:54,412
lt's imported stuff.

404
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,640
Really?

405
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,482
lmagine... your banners,
really big...

406
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:02,544
and your name
highlighted with diamonds...

407
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:04,351
Vardha bhai!

408
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,418
No one dares to
stand up to your might...

409
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:10,486
but this banner is rock solid!

410
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:11,621
Hold on...

411
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:12,526
lt won't tear?

412
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,327
lt won't.

413
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,264
You swear?

414
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:15,266
Sure.

415
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,396
l'm impressed.

416
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:21,633
So what do you want?

417
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,642
Go on, tell me.

418
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,337
Boss...

419
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:33,343
Vishnu...

420
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:35,982
We'll clear this mess and...

421
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,757
get an electric connection.

422
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:41,020
We'll put a water tank there.

423
00:33:41,294 --> 00:33:42,761
The rest of it is fine.

424
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:45,328
What do you say?

425
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:49,593
lt couldn't be better.

426
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:52,536
You know, l'd give
my life for you...

427
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:55,572
but don't ask for it!

428
00:33:58,378 --> 00:34:00,346
The kids should be here soon.

429
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:03,575
What's up, Gopi?

430
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:13,019
You're Vishnu Sir, right?

431
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,521
Sir, actually l...

432
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,752
l mean, we recognised
you at Ganpati's farewell.

433
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:18,363
We've heard a lot about you.

434
00:34:18,465 --> 00:34:20,365
You teach at JDC, right?

435
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:21,832
Not anymore.

436
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:23,368
Why not?
Did they fire you?

437
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,300
Bhavna!

438
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:26,339
He wasn't fired, he quit.

439
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:27,839
lt's all about self-respect!

440
00:34:27,907 --> 00:34:29,431
Actually they are right...

441
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,737
l quit and l was fired.

442
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:35,004
Rocky, he is not with JDC anymore.

443
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,680
How can he help us get in?

444
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,580
Let's go!

445
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,312
What's the hurry?

446
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:42,947
Now that we're here,
let's see what he can do.

447
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,454
Wait a minute.

448
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:45,923
Let me handle this.

449
00:34:45,992 --> 00:34:48,324
Sir, you've been a part
of JDC for so long...

450
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:50,329
l'm sure you can do something.

451
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:52,297
You know, help us get in...

452
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:55,024
Do you think you can
afford the fees at JDC?

453
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:57,359
That's the problem, sir!

454
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,495
Even if we pooled in all our money...

455
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:01,837
it wouldn't be enough
to cover one person's fee.

456
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,934
What if l teach you the same dance...

457
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:05,404
for free?

458
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,378
Free?

459
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:10,008
What are you doing, Vishnu?

460
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,342
l'm talking to them.

461
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:12,775
Hey Gopi!

462
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:14,979
l like what you've done here.

463
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:16,688
What are they doing here?

464
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:18,986
Do you own this place?

465
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:20,749
Don't get personal.

466
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,988
Why shouldn't l?

467
00:35:25,598 --> 00:35:28,465
Enough of this nonsense.

468
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:31,760
Vishnu wants to talk to you,
no fighting in here.

469
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,898
Listen to what he has to say,
it's for your own good.

470
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:36,464
Vishnu, all yours...

471
00:35:38,812 --> 00:35:40,905
l've seen you dance.

472
00:35:42,315 --> 00:35:43,907
You dance well...

473
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:45,814
but you can do better.

474
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:52,355
You need guidance and
all l've ever done is teach dance.

475
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:55,958
l want to teach you dance...

476
00:35:56,229 --> 00:35:59,630
like the performances that
you watch on Dance Dil Se.

477
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,996
You mean to say...

478
00:36:01,234 --> 00:36:03,828
these idiots can dance like that?

479
00:36:03,903 --> 00:36:04,961
Forget it, sir...

480
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:08,537
your efforts will be wasted.

481
00:36:08,608 --> 00:36:10,542
Biscuit!

482
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:12,702
lf you ever call us idiots again...

483
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:17,614
l'll make sure you
crumble like a biscuit!

484
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,513
lt's only because
of sir that l'm silent...

485
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,385
otherwise...

486
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,254
Otherwise... what will you do?

487
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:28,920
Listen...

488
00:36:28,995 --> 00:36:31,429
don't act smart in here.

489
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:33,432
l'll give you a piece of my mind.
Let's take this outside.

490
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,468
Watch what you say...

491
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:38,732
if l lose my temper,
you will be sorry.

492
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:40,773
And what's with the 'sir... sir...'

493
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,435
l can't believe how
you suck up to someone!

494
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:46,035
Let's go!

495
00:36:51,284 --> 00:36:52,979
Relax Rocky,
we'll deal with them later.

496
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:54,644
Sir, l'm sorry.

497
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:56,689
That's how D and his gang are.

498
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,587
But we are not like them.

499
00:36:58,658 --> 00:37:00,250
My team and l are with you.

500
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:01,293
When do we start?

501
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:02,259
Right now!

502
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:23,707
What?

503
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,412
Hello Qureshi Bhai!

504
00:38:35,488 --> 00:38:37,513
Hello Gopi!
What can l get you?

505
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,353
One and half kilo of mutton.

506
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:43,953
Step out of your
dream and start working.

507
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,292
One and half kilo of mutton.

508
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:48,334
Last time the quality
of the meat was bad

509
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:49,959
You heard that?

510
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,936
You better give
him good stuff this time.

511
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:55,270
He's going to ruin my shop!

512
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,704
lt's okay.

513
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:01,370
He will learn.

514
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:03,506
When will he learn?

515
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:04,914
After l die?

516
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:06,747
He is useless.

517
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:09,744
He is always day dreaming.

518
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:11,948
He never concentrates on work.

519
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,715
You are right.

520
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,259
lf you don't like
what you are doing...

521
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:18,726
then you can't dojustice to it.

522
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:22,434
You should always
do what you like.

523
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:26,730
Right?

524
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:00,438
What's going on?

525
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,035
No, we are just watching...

526
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,708
Yeah, just watching.

527
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:10,282
What?

528
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,514
Look at those steps.

529
00:40:15,688 --> 00:40:16,780
You want to go in?

530
00:40:16,856 --> 00:40:19,757
No... l'm just saying.

531
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:21,384
Hanging around like this won't help.

532
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,328
lf you really want to learn, go in.

533
00:40:25,598 --> 00:40:27,429
No, we are just watching.

534
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,364
We are not interested.

535
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:30,032
lt becomes 'new'.

536
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,965
Whenever you create something new...

537
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:34,700
it attracts the audience.

538
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,366
Sir, we are here...

539
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:37,909
to help you.

540
00:40:38,845 --> 00:40:40,745
Why do you think l need help?

541
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,075
lt's been four days that...

542
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,646
you've been trying
to teach them that step.

543
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:44,614
This is how it's done.

544
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:47,346
Give him room.

545
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,421
On the spot, goldspot!

546
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,083
Out!

547
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:53,917
But sir...

548
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:54,925
Get out!

549
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,561
Sorry sir.

550
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:04,494
D...

551
00:41:05,538 --> 00:41:07,597
there's only one teacher here...

552
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,799
me!

553
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:11,537
Don't ever come in
if you want to teach.

554
00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:13,806
But if you do want to learn...

555
00:41:15,915 --> 00:41:18,543
take a seat right now.

556
00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:33,431
Boys, ready.

557
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,624
Positions.

558
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:36,597
5

559
00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:37,067
6

560
00:41:37,303 --> 00:41:37,667
7

561
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:38,066
8

562
00:41:49,816 --> 00:41:51,613
What the--

563
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,775
Step back!

564
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,255
Go to your position.

565
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:01,986
Look straight.

566
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,323
5

567
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:08,696
6

568
00:42:08,768 --> 00:42:09,325
7

569
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:09,697
8

570
00:43:22,408 --> 00:43:23,466
Not bad!

571
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,470
Not bad, not bad...

572
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:30,007
Rhea...

573
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,473
you are a good dancer.

574
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:34,647
You are the lead.

575
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:40,854
You have to be better
then everybody else!

576
00:43:49,802 --> 00:43:50,564
Attitude...

577
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:54,970
is the correct use of the
body to portray feelings and emotions.

578
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:57,976
Attitude gives birth to expression.

579
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,747
Look ahead!

580
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:13,918
What's going on?

581
00:44:13,993 --> 00:44:15,255
Where the hell is he?

582
00:44:15,328 --> 00:44:16,886
l won't spare him.

583
00:44:18,264 --> 00:44:20,255
What's the matter, sir?

584
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,925
What's the matter?

585
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:24,435
lt's a narcotics raid!

586
00:44:24,503 --> 00:44:27,734
Sir, he always manages
to give us the slip.

587
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:30,401
He zips around on his motorcycle and
he hangs out with Babu.

588
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:32,376
What are you talking about?

589
00:44:32,445 --> 00:44:33,935
These kids are practicing dance.

590
00:44:34,013 --> 00:44:36,345
This is Vishnu Sir.

591
00:44:36,415 --> 00:44:37,905
And l'm his assistant.

592
00:44:37,984 --> 00:44:39,815
All of them are dancers.

593
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,817
All of them?

594
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,785
Yeah, every single one of them.

595
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,413
ln that case... start the music.

596
00:44:45,491 --> 00:44:48,722
Mayur... Rocky...
step ahead and dance.

597
00:44:48,794 --> 00:44:50,284
Hold on...

598
00:44:50,629 --> 00:44:51,561
not you...

599
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:52,562
you step forward...

600
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:53,359
not you...

601
00:44:53,432 --> 00:44:54,490
the one behind you.

602
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,727
Yes, you.

603
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:57,268
Start dancing.

604
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:37,763
Wow!

605
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,828
This guy can really dance!

606
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:42,868
Sir...

607
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:44,702
l'm sorry...

608
00:46:44,777 --> 00:46:47,268
l interrupted the rehearsal.

609
00:46:47,313 --> 00:46:48,803
lt will never happen again.

610
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:50,279
Of course it will.

611
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,578
No, it won't.

612
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:53,982
l said it will.

613
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,880
Chandu...

614
00:46:56,422 --> 00:46:58,890
you can deceive everyone,
even the police...

615
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:00,357
but not me.

616
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:05,357
You are always running
away from cops.

617
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:08,525
But you chose not to
hide amongst the crowd outside.

618
00:47:08,601 --> 00:47:11,229
lnstead you came here
where you stood out.

619
00:47:11,303 --> 00:47:12,235
Why?

620
00:47:12,304 --> 00:47:14,431
lt's because you don't want to hide.

621
00:47:14,507 --> 00:47:19,444
You want to display
your hidden talent!

622
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:24,373
Right?

623
00:47:29,255 --> 00:47:31,246
Sir, you are something else!

624
00:47:31,357 --> 00:47:32,654
l mean, how did you know?.

625
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:33,788
l'm a teacher.

626
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:35,019
lt's my job to know.

627
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:35,852
Shall we start?

628
00:47:35,928 --> 00:47:36,952
Yes, sir!

629
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,294
l'll teach you on one condition.

630
00:47:42,768 --> 00:47:45,032
Dance in itself is an addiction.

631
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:50,638
From now on you can only get
high on dance, nothing else!

632
00:47:53,812 --> 00:47:54,938
Sure, sir!

633
00:47:55,014 --> 00:47:56,777
l won't do it anymore.

634
00:47:56,849 --> 00:47:57,873
l promise.

635
00:48:00,553 --> 00:48:02,248
Wow... superb!

636
00:48:02,955 --> 00:48:04,320
You were great!

637
00:48:39,725 --> 00:48:42,250
lt's alright! lt's me.

638
00:48:42,728 --> 00:48:45,629
Spot!

639
00:49:02,715 --> 00:49:03,943
That's wonderful...

640
00:49:04,216 --> 00:49:05,706
Show me some passion...

641
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:21,860
Your core needs to be strong here.

642
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:24,992
What are you doing?

643
00:49:25,237 --> 00:49:26,329
lt's nothing.

644
00:49:26,405 --> 00:49:26,996
lt's nothing.

645
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:28,263
What are you doing?

646
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:28,999
Stop it!

647
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:29,707
Stop it!

648
00:49:29,775 --> 00:49:30,469
Listen to me...

649
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:31,440
it's all right.

650
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,534
You need to surrender.

651
00:49:32,645 --> 00:49:33,475
Stop!

652
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,501
You need to surrender.

653
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,478
Stop it!

654
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:36,571
Here wait.

655
00:49:39,985 --> 00:49:40,952
What?!

656
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:45,318
Vishnu sir!

657
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,018
Look who's here!

658
00:49:47,926 --> 00:49:49,621
Hey Poli,
where have you been?

659
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,559
l went there to...

660
00:49:50,629 --> 00:49:51,653
Listen to me.

661
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,788
Sir!

662
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,332
Vishnu sir, hello!

663
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,332
How are you?

664
00:49:55,401 --> 00:49:56,333
l'm fine.

665
00:49:56,402 --> 00:49:58,893
l have a surprise!

666
00:49:58,971 --> 00:50:00,302
A dancer!

667
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:04,742
She wants tojoin your team.

668
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,674
Please meet her.

669
00:50:05,744 --> 00:50:06,472
What's your name?

670
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,273
Poli...

671
00:50:07,313 --> 00:50:08,746
Poli, don't bore him!

672
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:10,042
Come to the point!

673
00:50:10,282 --> 00:50:13,877
He said there is a good dancer
who wants tojoin us.

674
00:50:13,952 --> 00:50:15,283
- Dancer?
- Yes.

675
00:50:15,354 --> 00:50:16,378
- Who?
- Her.

676
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:17,580
- Where?
- There.

677
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:18,918
- Then call her.
- Okay.

678
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:21,755
Shaina... baby come here.

679
00:50:23,295 --> 00:50:24,387
Baby?

680
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,309
Come baby.

681
00:50:40,479 --> 00:50:41,946
She's hot!

682
00:50:42,448 --> 00:50:43,073
Shaina?

683
00:50:43,315 --> 00:50:43,906
Hello sir.

684
00:50:43,982 --> 00:50:44,949
Not here.

685
00:50:45,017 --> 00:50:45,881
Vishnu sir!

686
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,749
Vishnu sir!

687
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,946
Okay.

688
00:50:49,021 --> 00:50:51,649
Please give me a chance.

689
00:50:51,724 --> 00:50:53,055
l won't disappoint you.

690
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:54,656
l can dance.

691
00:50:54,727 --> 00:50:57,355
She can dance really well, sir.

692
00:50:57,463 --> 00:50:59,260
She is fabulous.

693
00:50:59,298 --> 00:50:59,992
Where have you seen her dance?

694
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,257
At Red Rose bar...

695
00:51:05,371 --> 00:51:07,032
A bar dancer?

696
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,830
How does it matter?

697
00:51:08,907 --> 00:51:12,001
Separate 'bar' from bar dancer,
and you have 'dancer'.

698
00:51:12,478 --> 00:51:15,606
Anyone can fall on bad times.

699
00:51:16,382 --> 00:51:21,547
And, not every girl who dances in
a bar is bad.

700
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,021
Even if she were,
she'd still be a good dancer.

701
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,956
And Shaina is a really good dancer...

702
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,893
and a wonderful person.

703
00:51:30,562 --> 00:51:32,393
The rest is up to you.

704
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,831
All l want to say is that she is a...

705
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:38,960
very good dancer!

706
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:41,738
3...

707
00:51:41,774 --> 00:51:42,297
4...

708
00:51:42,374 --> 00:51:42,897
5...

709
00:51:42,941 --> 00:51:43,498
6...

710
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:43,906
7...

711
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:44,601
8...

712
00:51:48,947 --> 00:51:51,006
What a performance!

713
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,050
Hi.

714
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:54,417
Hi.

715
00:51:57,856 --> 00:51:59,255
Thanks Chandu!

716
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:01,320
l'll see you tomorrow.

717
00:52:01,593 --> 00:52:02,617
Bye.

718
00:53:44,897 --> 00:53:47,491
l'm so happy to see you Vishnu sir.

719
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,698
Sir, it's good to see
you smiling again.

720
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,397
Looks like you're doing well.

721
00:53:53,472 --> 00:53:54,871
l'm a simple teacher.

722
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,966
l get 10 students and l'm set!

723
00:53:58,243 --> 00:54:01,235
Do you have room
for one more student?

724
00:54:07,386 --> 00:54:08,512
Look at him...

725
00:54:08,587 --> 00:54:09,918
Forget it D...

726
00:54:24,736 --> 00:54:26,761
Rhea, this is Gopi!

727
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:29,602
Gopi sir, l've heard
a lot about you.

728
00:54:29,675 --> 00:54:31,267
Sir...

729
00:54:31,343 --> 00:54:34,278
the guys are getting impatient.

730
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:37,373
Why don't you introduce her to them?

731
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:38,940
This is Rhea.

732
00:54:39,017 --> 00:54:41,542
She was lead dancer of
JDC's winning team.

733
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,281
But now...

734
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,850
she is with us.

735
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:51,353
Today is Rhea's first day with us,
so let's freak out.

736
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,793
Very sweet girl... hmm?

737
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,538
Wow.

738
00:55:58,797 --> 00:56:01,527
Okay everyone!
Great job!

739
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:06,394
l would like to give you all a gift.

740
00:56:06,471 --> 00:56:07,802
Party!

741
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,275
New speakers.

742
00:56:13,345 --> 00:56:14,403
New speakers.

743
00:56:14,513 --> 00:56:15,741
We have to get new speakers!

744
00:56:16,648 --> 00:56:18,377
Poli, come on.

745
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:20,445
Here is the money...

746
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:22,487
for new speakers.

747
00:56:22,888 --> 00:56:24,321
Okay sir.

748
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:27,381
We start early tomorrow,
so no partying all night.

749
00:56:27,459 --> 00:56:28,949
Go home and rest.

750
00:56:38,036 --> 00:56:39,401
You're leaving?

751
00:56:39,471 --> 00:56:40,836
Yeah the class is over.

752
00:56:40,906 --> 00:56:43,466
Sure the class is over
but we could do something.

753
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:45,032
Like what?

754
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,541
You know... hang out... chill.

755
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,842
So, you do this every day?

756
00:56:49,915 --> 00:56:52,509
No, but today is special.

757
00:56:52,584 --> 00:56:53,448
Yeah!

758
00:56:53,518 --> 00:56:54,712
lt's because you came into my life...

759
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,413
l mean... our team...

760
00:56:56,688 --> 00:56:57,746
Rhea...

761
00:56:57,823 --> 00:56:59,484
why don't we go somewhere?

762
00:56:59,558 --> 00:57:00,456
Wow!

763
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:02,493
This is damn cool.

764
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,722
Look at them flirt with her.

765
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,766
She's cool with it.

766
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:11,836
Can't you see she's flirting too?

767
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:13,894
Guys...

768
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,837
We're going to 'Down Under'.

769
00:57:15,907 --> 00:57:16,703
All of us!

770
00:57:16,775 --> 00:57:17,799
lt's my treat!

771
00:58:03,622 --> 00:58:04,748
Hey...

772
00:58:04,823 --> 00:58:05,847
Shall we.

773
00:58:05,924 --> 00:58:07,221
Come on.

774
00:58:08,794 --> 00:58:09,920
Wow.

775
00:58:13,765 --> 00:58:14,789
Hi.

776
00:58:16,401 --> 00:58:17,561
What is this?

777
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:27,905
Come.

778
00:58:32,984 --> 00:58:34,975
This is out of this world!

779
00:58:35,253 --> 00:58:38,654
l had heard about this place
but being here is bloody cool!

780
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,714
This place is like an open lottery.

781
00:58:40,792 --> 00:58:41,850
Superb!

782
00:58:42,928 --> 00:58:44,657
We'll show them!

783
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,661
We don't have money to bet.

784
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,293
Of course we do.

785
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:55,601
Poli is here and so is the money
Sir gave for speakers.

786
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,740
Sir won't like this at all.

787
00:59:00,812 --> 00:59:03,781
We'll double this, if we win.

788
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:07,476
And go for really huge speakers.

789
00:59:11,823 --> 00:59:15,259
Today is our first day here.

790
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,885
We'll challenge them another day.

791
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,294
Please shut him up!

792
00:59:19,364 --> 00:59:22,663
We have the money right now,
let's make the most of it.

793
00:59:22,734 --> 00:59:25,362
Let's give them a taste of our skills.

794
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:30,835
Listen D.

795
00:59:30,909 --> 00:59:32,001
Poli, why did give the money?

796
00:59:32,244 --> 00:59:33,404
l was helpless.

797
00:59:38,016 --> 00:59:39,574
Take this.

798
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,543
Hurry up!

799
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,679
What are you doing?

800
00:59:43,755 --> 00:59:45,780
lt's okay!

801
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:48,257
Relax... trust me!

802
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,588
Don't worry!

803
00:59:51,563 --> 00:59:57,263
The next battle is between
these new kids and Fictitious Crew!

804
01:00:08,046 --> 01:00:09,343
Come D.

805
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:12,746
Did you speak?

806
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:13,841
Let me speak.

807
01:00:13,919 --> 01:00:15,284
Listen...

808
01:00:24,763 --> 01:00:26,458
Come on D.

809
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,748
Come on D!

810
01:01:07,505 --> 01:01:08,836
That's Rocky.

811
01:01:23,688 --> 01:01:24,677
Oh my god!

812
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,992
Wait.

813
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,296
Let them go.

814
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:39,302
Come on, guys.

815
01:02:21,546 --> 01:02:22,843
Stop... okay.

816
01:03:13,631 --> 01:03:14,859
Everybody... positions!

817
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,858
Let's do this step...

818
01:03:17,936 --> 01:03:18,868
l said this step...

819
01:03:18,937 --> 01:03:20,336
What are you doing?

820
01:03:20,738 --> 01:03:22,763
Come on...

821
01:03:22,874 --> 01:03:23,806
Don't you get it?

822
01:03:23,908 --> 01:03:25,307
Why don't you get it?

823
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:12,967
Vishnu sir.

824
01:08:37,255 --> 01:08:38,415
Vishnu sir.

825
01:08:42,894 --> 01:08:46,694
Superb performance.
Wasn't that great everyone?

826
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:51,760
Superb.

827
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:52,996
Wonderful!

828
01:09:02,447 --> 01:09:06,611
Three hours ago l thought
l had a dance team...

829
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:10,518
that could compete in Dance Dil Se.

830
01:09:10,988 --> 01:09:12,285
But...

831
01:09:12,557 --> 01:09:13,717
no!

832
01:09:15,893 --> 01:09:17,793
You can't dance.

833
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:22,322
Because you don't know
what the D in dance signifies.

834
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:26,601
D is for discipline.

835
01:09:26,671 --> 01:09:28,002
lt's over!

836
01:09:32,009 --> 01:09:32,805
Sorry sir...

837
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:33,901
Shut up.

838
01:09:53,034 --> 01:09:56,663
Please don't go, Vishnu!

839
01:09:56,738 --> 01:09:57,932
Vishnu...

840
01:09:58,807 --> 01:10:00,035
Vishnu...

841
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:01,865
let it go!

842
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:04,241
You don't look good
when you're angry.

843
01:10:04,779 --> 01:10:06,371
l mean,
you don't look bad.

844
01:10:06,414 --> 01:10:08,405
But if kids don't make
mistakes, who will?

845
01:10:08,717 --> 01:10:10,150
No, Gopi.

846
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:11,149
lt was my mistake.

847
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:12,447
You were right.

848
01:10:12,687 --> 01:10:14,348
They are good for nothing.

849
01:10:14,422 --> 01:10:16,447
Please don't go, Vishnu!

850
01:10:17,025 --> 01:10:18,185
Vishnu...

851
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,791
Vishnu...

852
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:15,368
Sir please!

853
01:13:15,436 --> 01:13:16,903
Please don't go!

854
01:13:16,971 --> 01:13:18,131
Sorry sir!

855
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,170
Sir, it was my fault.

856
01:13:22,343 --> 01:13:25,676
l shouldn't have taken
them to the club.

857
01:13:26,381 --> 01:13:29,748
They should've used their brains.

858
01:13:29,817 --> 01:13:32,183
lf you tell them to
walk on fire, will they?

859
01:13:32,253 --> 01:13:34,346
No, not if l tell them.

860
01:13:34,422 --> 01:13:37,220
But they will if you do.

861
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:38,725
Please sir...

862
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,886
we've worked really hard...

863
01:13:39,928 --> 01:13:41,293
we painted the place,
bought speakers...

864
01:13:41,362 --> 01:13:42,693
please don't go!

865
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:43,822
Sir, please sir!

866
01:13:43,865 --> 01:13:46,060
We will never repeat this again.

867
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:47,192
We swear!

868
01:13:47,268 --> 01:13:48,326
Please sir!

869
01:13:56,411 --> 01:13:57,742
Yeah!

870
01:14:06,988 --> 01:14:08,956
Hey try and be helpful.

871
01:14:20,702 --> 01:14:21,862
Awesome!

872
01:14:22,036 --> 01:14:25,836
lt's what every
dancer wants to hear...

873
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:30,943
But if all the dancers
on stage are good...

874
01:14:31,012 --> 01:14:33,105
how will you stand out?

875
01:14:35,049 --> 01:14:36,448
That's what l want to see today!

876
01:14:36,751 --> 01:14:38,013
Try to impress me.

877
01:14:38,286 --> 01:14:40,880
Do something which
makes the world go...

878
01:14:40,955 --> 01:14:42,047
awesome!

879
01:14:50,798 --> 01:14:52,163
Let me show how it's done.

880
01:14:52,233 --> 01:14:53,097
Sir, we will...

881
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:53,963
We will go first.

882
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:55,366
Back off!

883
01:15:00,942 --> 01:15:01,738
Not that dance.

884
01:15:01,809 --> 01:15:02,901
Which one?

885
01:15:02,977 --> 01:15:04,239
That's the one.

886
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:06,010
Let's start.

887
01:16:38,306 --> 01:16:39,967
Oh wow.

888
01:16:54,188 --> 01:16:56,816
Okay... boys and girls.

889
01:16:56,891 --> 01:16:59,018
And of course, Chris!

890
01:17:00,728 --> 01:17:02,719
The day you've been
waiting for is finally here.

891
01:17:02,763 --> 01:17:05,857
The Mumbai auditions
of DDS start tomorrow.

892
01:17:05,933 --> 01:17:07,798
And are we ready!

893
01:17:07,869 --> 01:17:09,166
Yeah!

894
01:17:09,337 --> 01:17:10,998
Okay.

895
01:17:11,072 --> 01:17:12,630
A word of advice.

896
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:15,668
We are champions.

897
01:17:16,711 --> 01:17:19,111
Obviously, we are champions.

898
01:17:20,748 --> 01:17:23,046
But l want you to
behave like champions.

899
01:17:24,051 --> 01:17:27,350
Others will hug each other
and shake hands...

900
01:17:27,421 --> 01:17:29,252
they call it the sporting spirit.

901
01:17:30,892 --> 01:17:32,291
l call it bullshit!

902
01:17:34,328 --> 01:17:35,659
lt's merely an excuse...

903
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:36,890
for the losers.

904
01:17:36,964 --> 01:17:39,797
You know... it's a way of masking
their embarrassment.

905
01:17:39,867 --> 01:17:40,856
That's why...

906
01:17:41,936 --> 01:17:44,268
Oh baby, you're so good,
you know?.

907
01:17:44,338 --> 01:17:47,739
l mean yeah, hard luck baby...
sporting spirit!

908
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:53,102
But here at JDC, losing is...

909
01:17:54,182 --> 01:17:55,774
never an option.

910
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:57,147
lt never was!

911
01:17:57,218 --> 01:17:59,083
So your mantra for victory is...

912
01:18:00,188 --> 01:18:01,678
To impress!

913
01:18:03,624 --> 01:18:07,060
Whatever you do, make sure
the audience is impressed.

914
01:18:07,728 --> 01:18:08,922
Take a look at me...

915
01:18:09,697 --> 01:18:12,131
this hair, these lenses,
this goatee...

916
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,895
it's all to impress!

917
01:18:16,137 --> 01:18:20,267
Your every move, every turn,
every jump, every step...

918
01:18:20,341 --> 01:18:21,968
should have only one goal.

919
01:18:23,044 --> 01:18:26,172
We dance to impress!

920
01:18:28,983 --> 01:18:32,851
Animals dance to
impress their mates.

921
01:18:35,323 --> 01:18:37,188
We must dance to...

922
01:18:38,826 --> 01:18:40,054
express!

923
01:18:40,962 --> 01:18:43,931
Being able to convey
your feelings through dance...

924
01:18:43,998 --> 01:18:46,694
will make you a good dancer.

925
01:18:47,101 --> 01:18:48,659
Excuse me!

926
01:18:48,703 --> 01:18:50,864
Everybody... get out.

927
01:18:50,938 --> 01:18:53,338
Confiscate all their equipment
and seal this place.

928
01:18:53,608 --> 01:18:57,977
Sir, l think there's been a mistake.

929
01:18:58,045 --> 01:19:00,878
We aren't doing anything illegal.

930
01:19:01,382 --> 01:19:02,178
Hey...

931
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,182
please don't touch the equipment.

932
01:19:03,251 --> 01:19:04,309
Please!

933
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,046
And what if he does?

934
01:19:10,057 --> 01:19:12,821
ls this your ancestral property,
to set up a dance class?

935
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,293
And without permission!

936
01:19:14,362 --> 01:19:16,956
How dare you stare at me?

937
01:19:17,031 --> 01:19:18,726
Watch it!

938
01:19:18,799 --> 01:19:20,027
Or you'll regret it.

939
01:19:20,101 --> 01:19:22,069
ls that right?

940
01:19:39,353 --> 01:19:41,787
Rushali, call Vardha bhai.

941
01:19:41,856 --> 01:19:43,084
Dad is out of town.

942
01:19:43,157 --> 01:19:45,250
lf he were here,
he'd take care of it.

943
01:19:46,427 --> 01:19:47,894
Thank you, Qureshi bhai.

944
01:19:48,362 --> 01:19:49,351
Let's go!

945
01:19:54,235 --> 01:19:56,260
Well done, Qureshi bhai.

946
01:19:56,304 --> 01:19:58,898
So you called the cops?

947
01:19:59,106 --> 01:20:04,237
You're behind this ruckus.

948
01:20:04,979 --> 01:20:06,378
You create a ruckus every day.

949
01:20:06,447 --> 01:20:08,813
You know what...

950
01:20:08,883 --> 01:20:12,876
this drunkard wants
to ruin our children's future.

951
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:14,744
Don't you agree with me?

952
01:20:14,822 --> 01:20:16,255
Why is everyone else silent?

953
01:20:19,093 --> 01:20:20,424
Tell them to leave.

954
01:20:20,695 --> 01:20:21,957
Stop this nonsense.

955
01:20:22,029 --> 01:20:23,428
No dancing anymore!

956
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:25,757
Please...

957
01:20:27,134 --> 01:20:28,829
l understand your concern.

958
01:20:28,903 --> 01:20:32,896
You want your kids to
settle down, just like you.

959
01:20:33,841 --> 01:20:35,968
But ask yourself...

960
01:20:37,044 --> 01:20:39,205
are you really happy
with where you are?

961
01:20:40,114 --> 01:20:41,411
Are you happy with your life?

962
01:20:41,482 --> 01:20:43,814
We live a simple life, Vishnu.

963
01:20:43,851 --> 01:20:47,810
We spend 2.5 rupees on tea
and 5 rupees on a sandwich.

964
01:20:47,888 --> 01:20:49,253
That's our worth.

965
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:52,086
We shouldn't dream about
what we can't afford.

966
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,218
lt's not about your dreams.

967
01:20:54,328 --> 01:20:55,852
lt's your mindset
that's holding you back.

968
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:58,831
Your children can
be more successful than you.

969
01:20:58,899 --> 01:21:03,302
But only if you are more liberal
than your own parents were.

970
01:21:04,338 --> 01:21:05,362
l request you...

971
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:08,203
Don't you do that.

972
01:21:09,176 --> 01:21:10,803
You know something...

973
01:21:10,878 --> 01:21:12,209
this is how society is...

974
01:21:12,279 --> 01:21:14,144
they don't want to accept change.

975
01:21:14,215 --> 01:21:17,707
They are like crabs in a basket.

976
01:21:17,785 --> 01:21:21,050
lf one crab tries to climb out,
the others drag it down.

977
01:21:21,088 --> 01:21:22,953
They are all crabs.

978
01:21:23,023 --> 01:21:24,217
Crabs!

979
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:28,189
We are earthworms.

980
01:21:29,363 --> 01:21:32,924
lf earthworms were meant to fly...

981
01:21:33,734 --> 01:21:35,702
wouldn't God give them wings?

982
01:21:37,438 --> 01:21:38,427
Let's go!

983
01:21:39,006 --> 01:21:40,371
Let's go, everyone.

984
01:21:41,075 --> 01:21:41,871
Move.

985
01:21:41,942 --> 01:21:43,807
Let's go!

986
01:21:44,311 --> 01:21:46,108
No sense in waiting here.

987
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:47,340
Let's go!

988
01:26:58,659 --> 01:26:59,819
We are dead.

989
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:00,958
Just relax!

990
01:27:01,028 --> 01:27:02,086
Relax?

991
01:27:02,196 --> 01:27:04,221
We couldn't survive Down Under.

992
01:27:04,298 --> 01:27:05,993
And the competition
here is a lot better.

993
01:27:10,637 --> 01:27:12,969
At Down Under,
Vishnu sir saved our skin.

994
01:27:13,273 --> 01:27:15,207
But here that's not an option.

995
01:27:15,275 --> 01:27:17,266
Relax... don't worry.

996
01:27:17,811 --> 01:27:19,301
We are in trouble!

997
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:21,704
D is still not here.

998
01:27:21,982 --> 01:27:22,676
Okay!

999
01:27:22,716 --> 01:27:23,273
How long do we wait for him?

1000
01:27:23,317 --> 01:27:24,045
He won't come.

1001
01:27:24,084 --> 01:27:25,244
He will!

1002
01:27:25,319 --> 01:27:27,787
l don't think his dad
will let him come.

1003
01:27:27,855 --> 01:27:29,117
Where can l register?

1004
01:27:29,156 --> 01:27:30,145
There.

1005
01:27:30,657 --> 01:27:31,749
Guys.

1006
01:27:31,959 --> 01:27:34,427
Sorry l'm late...

1007
01:27:34,695 --> 01:27:35,684
What's up, Chandu?

1008
01:27:35,763 --> 01:27:36,855
D... you made it!

1009
01:27:37,264 --> 01:27:38,026
D...

1010
01:27:38,098 --> 01:27:38,996
Yes, l made it.

1011
01:27:39,066 --> 01:27:40,294
What's with the bags?

1012
01:27:40,367 --> 01:27:42,130
l was stepping out...

1013
01:27:42,669 --> 01:27:43,192
Dad threw a fit...

1014
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:44,362
l stood my ground...

1015
01:27:44,705 --> 01:27:47,003
Mom began to cry...

1016
01:27:47,074 --> 01:27:48,006
Dad threatened...

1017
01:27:48,075 --> 01:27:50,839
'lf you step out,
you can never come back.'

1018
01:27:50,944 --> 01:27:52,002
Then?

1019
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:54,877
You know, l can't live without music.

1020
01:27:54,948 --> 01:27:57,075
So l packed my CDs and walked out.

1021
01:27:57,151 --> 01:27:59,016
No worries.

1022
01:27:59,086 --> 01:28:00,986
We're with you.

1023
01:28:24,411 --> 01:28:25,810
Nice.

1024
01:28:34,655 --> 01:28:36,088
Well done!

1025
01:28:36,156 --> 01:28:36,918
Congratulations!

1026
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:39,390
l'm sure you know JDC.

1027
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:44,996
The next performers are
first-time participants in DDS.

1028
01:28:45,065 --> 01:28:46,896
they are...

1029
01:28:46,934 --> 01:28:48,060
DDR!

1030
01:28:48,101 --> 01:28:49,125
Yeah!

1031
01:29:07,988 --> 01:29:10,115
1... 2... 3... 4...

1032
01:29:11,391 --> 01:29:13,951
Ganpati Baapa Morya!

1033
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:18,758
Oh no...

1034
01:30:18,825 --> 01:30:19,314
Bad.

1035
01:30:19,393 --> 01:30:20,724
What are you doing?

1036
01:30:21,728 --> 01:30:22,387
Why did you do that?

1037
01:30:22,696 --> 01:30:23,321
Have you lost it?

1038
01:30:23,397 --> 01:30:25,058
No, you have!

1039
01:30:35,242 --> 01:30:38,234
Jehangir, it's bad.

1040
01:30:47,354 --> 01:30:48,082
Hi sir.

1041
01:30:48,155 --> 01:30:48,917
Hi Vishnu.

1042
01:30:49,056 --> 01:30:51,354
They are very good dancers,
believe me.

1043
01:30:51,425 --> 01:30:53,017
Watch out for them
in the next round.

1044
01:30:53,093 --> 01:30:55,027
What makes you think
they will make it?

1045
01:30:55,095 --> 01:30:56,653
Did you see them dance?

1046
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:59,130
l mean they were fighting
rather than dancing.

1047
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:00,223
lt was funny!

1048
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,733
What's wrong with funny?

1049
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,232
l mean...

1050
01:31:04,738 --> 01:31:06,103
l like funny!

1051
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:09,834
Of course, l shouldn't say this but...

1052
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:14,142
if l were ajudge,
l would promote them.

1053
01:31:14,982 --> 01:31:16,449
You want to turn this into
a comedy show?.

1054
01:31:16,717 --> 01:31:17,706
So what?

1055
01:31:17,784 --> 01:31:20,344
More entertainment for your audience!

1056
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:24,322
Moreover, after watching DDR's 'dance'
the audience will realise that...

1057
01:31:24,391 --> 01:31:28,987
real dancing is not
as easy as it appears on TV!

1058
01:31:29,062 --> 01:31:30,256
Think about it!

1059
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:31,991
He's got a point.

1060
01:31:32,065 --> 01:31:33,396
The point is...

1061
01:31:33,467 --> 01:31:34,866
have you ever been to a circus?

1062
01:31:34,935 --> 01:31:35,924
Huh?

1063
01:31:36,003 --> 01:31:38,767
At a circus, you have these jokers...

1064
01:31:38,872 --> 01:31:41,306
who are there
to amuse the audience.

1065
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:43,805
This show could do
with some amusement.

1066
01:31:43,877 --> 01:31:45,811
And DDR fit the bill.

1067
01:31:45,879 --> 01:31:47,039
Think about it.

1068
01:31:47,114 --> 01:31:47,773
Of course...

1069
01:31:47,848 --> 01:31:49,042
the final decision is yours.

1070
01:31:49,116 --> 01:31:51,243
But l really like funny.

1071
01:32:26,787 --> 01:32:29,756
What are you doing here, Vishnu?

1072
01:32:29,823 --> 01:32:31,814
Vardha bhai has thrown a party.

1073
01:32:32,292 --> 01:32:33,816
No partying!

1074
01:32:34,995 --> 01:32:36,087
Why not?

1075
01:32:37,097 --> 01:32:38,689
Get everyone here for the rehearsal.

1076
01:32:39,733 --> 01:32:40,700
Now?.

1077
01:32:40,767 --> 01:32:41,461
Yes, right now!

1078
01:32:48,442 --> 01:32:49,932
We are jokers!

1079
01:32:53,713 --> 01:32:57,774
We are in the second round
so that everyone can laugh at us!

1080
01:32:57,851 --> 01:32:58,977
Jokers!

1081
01:32:59,252 --> 01:33:00,719
They called you...

1082
01:33:01,154 --> 01:33:02,246
jokers!

1083
01:33:02,789 --> 01:33:04,256
Can you tell me why?

1084
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:06,316
Can you?

1085
01:33:13,967 --> 01:33:14,865
Good.

1086
01:33:14,935 --> 01:33:15,959
Boys back!

1087
01:33:16,036 --> 01:33:16,764
Back...

1088
01:33:16,837 --> 01:33:17,826
boys back!

1089
01:33:17,971 --> 01:33:19,905
Move 4 steps to your left.

1090
01:33:19,973 --> 01:33:21,099
5... 6... 7... 8...

1091
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:22,732
Do a wall back stand.

1092
01:33:22,809 --> 01:33:24,834
Turn... he is the wall.

1093
01:33:25,245 --> 01:33:26,269
Ready?

1094
01:33:26,446 --> 01:33:28,437
5... 6... 7... 8...

1095
01:33:29,149 --> 01:33:30,173
What the--

1096
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,376
What happened?

1097
01:33:31,451 --> 01:33:32,782
l thought he wasn't ready.

1098
01:33:32,853 --> 01:33:33,945
Sir, l was ready...

1099
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:35,715
but l don't think he knows this step.

1100
01:33:35,789 --> 01:33:37,120
Lack of faith!

1101
01:33:38,892 --> 01:33:41,360
Both of you assumed that...

1102
01:33:41,795 --> 01:33:44,457
the other is not ready.

1103
01:33:44,731 --> 01:33:47,131
That's why you failed.

1104
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,033
You need to trust each other,
to dance as a team.

1105
01:33:51,705 --> 01:33:52,399
D...

1106
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:53,901
whom do you trust?

1107
01:33:53,974 --> 01:33:54,406
Bawa!

1108
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:55,675
Bawa!

1109
01:33:55,742 --> 01:33:56,174
Rocky?

1110
01:33:56,243 --> 01:33:57,301
Sir, Mayur.

1111
01:33:57,377 --> 01:33:58,776
Mayur!

1112
01:33:58,945 --> 01:34:00,378
Get me the blindfolds.

1113
01:34:05,051 --> 01:34:06,143
Blindfold them.

1114
01:34:11,324 --> 01:34:12,416
Tie them.

1115
01:34:12,692 --> 01:34:14,023
Fast.

1116
01:34:19,432 --> 01:34:22,128
Rocky will do the step with Mayur...

1117
01:34:22,202 --> 01:34:24,432
and D with Bawa.

1118
01:34:30,177 --> 01:34:33,271
Go back four steps.

1119
01:34:47,827 --> 01:34:51,024
5... 6... 7... 8...

1120
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,665
Mayur...

1121
01:34:55,168 --> 01:34:56,328
did we do it.

1122
01:35:04,244 --> 01:35:05,643
Do you get it?

1123
01:35:05,712 --> 01:35:08,374
lt was trust that helped you
perform with a blindfold.

1124
01:35:08,648 --> 01:35:10,275
You must trust each other.

1125
01:35:11,251 --> 01:35:14,846
Until you don't get this step
right with your eyes open...

1126
01:35:14,921 --> 01:35:17,754
nobody goes home tonight.

1127
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:31,996
Here.

1128
01:35:39,846 --> 01:35:40,813
Come on.

1129
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:41,972
Come on, D.

1130
01:35:59,699 --> 01:36:00,757
Dammit.

1131
01:36:04,104 --> 01:36:05,093
What's going on?

1132
01:36:05,171 --> 01:36:06,331
l don't know.

1133
01:36:07,874 --> 01:36:08,806
Forget it.

1134
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:09,842
He doesn't trust me.

1135
01:36:09,909 --> 01:36:10,876
Don't tell me.

1136
01:36:10,977 --> 01:36:12,308
lt's his fault.

1137
01:36:24,658 --> 01:36:27,126
D...
Have some water.

1138
01:36:30,964 --> 01:36:32,329
Do you remember...

1139
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:36,768
you, Rocky and me
playing together as kids?

1140
01:36:36,836 --> 01:36:38,394
We had no worries back then.

1141
01:36:38,705 --> 01:36:39,967
Everyone does silly stuff
when they're kids.

1142
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:40,802
You don't get it.

1143
01:36:40,874 --> 01:36:42,273
You're being silly now.

1144
01:36:42,342 --> 01:36:45,800
Tell me why you and Rocky
don't see eye to eye?

1145
01:36:45,879 --> 01:36:48,040
He charmed Rhea.

1146
01:36:48,114 --> 01:36:50,605
Rhea is not the problem.

1147
01:36:50,684 --> 01:36:52,618
She's been here only a few weeks.

1148
01:36:52,686 --> 01:36:55,348
Rocky has envied you for years.

1149
01:36:55,622 --> 01:36:56,884
Rocky is jealous of me?

1150
01:36:56,956 --> 01:36:58,116
Yes, he envied you.

1151
01:36:58,191 --> 01:36:59,385
Want to know why?

1152
01:36:59,659 --> 01:37:02,025
lt started when Bhavna
moved here five years ago.

1153
01:37:02,095 --> 01:37:04,757
Though Bhavna lived near Rocky...

1154
01:37:04,831 --> 01:37:07,766
she looked up to you
for every little thing.

1155
01:37:07,834 --> 01:37:09,893
Rocky couldn't bear it.

1156
01:37:10,003 --> 01:37:12,301
Since then Rocky and you
have been at loggerheads.

1157
01:37:12,972 --> 01:37:15,770
Now Rocky is seeing Rhea.

1158
01:37:16,743 --> 01:37:18,734
But you are still being silly...

1159
01:37:18,812 --> 01:37:20,677
l mean, you and Bhavna.

1160
01:37:20,747 --> 01:37:22,806
Says the fool that's
throwing his life away.

1161
01:37:22,882 --> 01:37:23,678
What the--

1162
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:24,910
Shaina, guess what Chandu is up to.

1163
01:37:24,984 --> 01:37:25,780
Nothing...

1164
01:37:25,852 --> 01:37:27,843
Bhavna, come here.

1165
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:29,252
Bhavna...

1166
01:37:29,889 --> 01:37:30,981
What is it?

1167
01:37:31,057 --> 01:37:32,285
D is looking for you.

1168
01:37:32,359 --> 01:37:33,383
- What happened?
- Nothing!

1169
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:34,718
You're smoking again!

1170
01:37:36,029 --> 01:37:37,257
What's up?

1171
01:37:37,697 --> 01:37:39,164
Nothing... l mean...
Chandu is crazy.

1172
01:37:39,232 --> 01:37:40,358
Sorry!

1173
01:37:40,433 --> 01:37:41,923
What is it?

1174
01:37:43,169 --> 01:37:45,694
Why didn't you tell me?

1175
01:37:45,805 --> 01:37:47,067
Tell you what?

1176
01:37:48,108 --> 01:37:49,598
You know...

1177
01:37:50,844 --> 01:37:52,709
that you like me...

1178
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:55,641
What's to tell?

1179
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:59,116
Don't you know it?

1180
01:38:00,053 --> 01:38:01,611
Well... l'm an idiot!

1181
01:38:01,688 --> 01:38:02,848
How would l know?.

1182
01:38:02,922 --> 01:38:03,911
ldiot?

1183
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:06,185
You think l have a PhD in love!

1184
01:38:06,926 --> 01:38:07,915
Love?

1185
01:38:09,028 --> 01:38:10,893
That's super fast!

1186
01:38:10,964 --> 01:38:12,795
l was still at 'like'...

1187
01:38:12,966 --> 01:38:14,661
but you've moved onto love.

1188
01:38:14,734 --> 01:38:18,192
Love, marriage, children...
you've got it all planned.

1189
01:38:18,271 --> 01:38:20,398
Stop it or else...

1190
01:38:21,841 --> 01:38:22,773
Else what?

1191
01:38:22,842 --> 01:38:24,002
No future?

1192
01:38:24,077 --> 01:38:25,135
Shut up!

1193
01:38:25,879 --> 01:38:26,811
Rocky!

1194
01:41:33,099 --> 01:41:34,396
Look at them man...

1195
01:41:34,467 --> 01:41:36,367
Superb.

1196
01:41:45,111 --> 01:41:46,772
Now that's what l call dance!

1197
01:41:56,155 --> 01:41:59,056
l didn't expect we'd make it this far.

1198
01:41:59,125 --> 01:42:01,923
The championship is only
two steps away from us.

1199
01:42:01,995 --> 01:42:03,257
Semifinals and...

1200
01:42:03,329 --> 01:42:04,387
Finals!

1201
01:42:06,699 --> 01:42:07,791
Move.

1202
01:42:10,003 --> 01:42:12,335
But we have to watch every step.

1203
01:42:12,405 --> 01:42:13,667
Yes!

1204
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:14,729
Sir!

1205
01:42:21,014 --> 01:42:22,345
Chandu!

1206
01:42:25,752 --> 01:42:26,946
Chandu...

1207
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:28,214
stand straight.

1208
01:42:29,022 --> 01:42:30,216
Step forward.

1209
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:31,948
Here.

1210
01:42:33,192 --> 01:42:35,717
Sir, straight... attention!

1211
01:42:40,867 --> 01:42:44,769
You promised to
give up this bad habit.

1212
01:42:46,339 --> 01:42:47,829
Why did you break your promise?

1213
01:42:49,642 --> 01:42:50,734
Sir...

1214
01:42:52,011 --> 01:42:53,945
lt was a mistake.

1215
01:42:54,914 --> 01:42:56,347
lt was a mistake.

1216
01:42:56,883 --> 01:42:59,249
l met Babu and some other friends.

1217
01:43:00,153 --> 01:43:02,781
We were celebrating...
the semifinals.

1218
01:43:03,656 --> 01:43:05,055
lt started with one drag...

1219
01:43:05,124 --> 01:43:07,649
then another... and another...

1220
01:43:10,396 --> 01:43:11,761
Sir...

1221
01:43:12,899 --> 01:43:16,335
Sir, today is not the first time
since l gave you my word.

1222
01:43:18,304 --> 01:43:20,169
l've been using some,
just to stay high.

1223
01:43:27,213 --> 01:43:29,909
l'm a dog's tail that can
never be straightened, sir!

1224
01:43:29,982 --> 01:43:35,215
l'm a dog's tail!

1225
01:43:36,089 --> 01:43:37,954
l can't be trusted.

1226
01:43:39,192 --> 01:43:41,251
You trusted me...

1227
01:43:43,362 --> 01:43:45,023
but l betrayed you.

1228
01:43:46,065 --> 01:43:48,363
l can't be trusted.

1229
01:43:51,304 --> 01:43:54,637
Chandu, l've trusted
you since the day l met you.

1230
01:43:54,674 --> 01:43:56,369
l still do and always will.

1231
01:43:57,276 --> 01:43:59,210
lf you can't give up
this addiction for yourself...

1232
01:43:59,278 --> 01:44:01,269
l'm sure you will
give it up for us.

1233
01:44:09,322 --> 01:44:10,880
l have an idea!

1234
01:44:10,957 --> 01:44:15,189
Chandu should be the lead dancer
in the semifinal.

1235
01:44:15,261 --> 01:44:16,660
l agree with Rocky.

1236
01:44:16,729 --> 01:44:17,423
Brilliant idea!

1237
01:44:17,697 --> 01:44:19,392
He will be so busy rehearsing that...

1238
01:44:19,665 --> 01:44:22,259
he won't have time for anything else.

1239
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,069
Chandu...

1240
01:44:35,148 --> 01:44:36,240
Shaina, back...

1241
01:44:36,282 --> 01:44:37,749
boys back!

1242
01:44:37,817 --> 01:44:39,011
Get up!

1243
01:44:40,219 --> 01:44:41,413
Sound!

1244
01:44:54,834 --> 01:44:56,267
Get up!

1245
01:45:00,306 --> 01:45:02,001
Get up!

1246
01:45:03,976 --> 01:45:04,908
Sound!

1247
01:45:06,746 --> 01:45:09,146
Vishnu, l promise,
l will lose weight.

1248
01:45:09,215 --> 01:45:11,274
And l'll give Jehangir...

1249
01:45:15,688 --> 01:45:17,087
Where is he going now?.

1250
01:45:17,957 --> 01:45:19,754
Such a loser.

1251
01:45:19,959 --> 01:45:21,051
Vishnu, l'll be back soon.

1252
01:45:21,127 --> 01:45:21,889
What is it?

1253
01:45:21,961 --> 01:45:22,893
Just a minute.

1254
01:46:58,090 --> 01:47:05,326
The semifinals of Close up Dance Dil Se
powered by Spinz will begin in a few hours!

1255
01:47:05,398 --> 01:47:11,098
Fans supporting their teams
have gathered here since morning.

1256
01:47:11,170 --> 01:47:14,936
One team here has left
everyone speechless.

1257
01:47:15,007 --> 01:47:16,702
Any guesses?

1258
01:47:16,776 --> 01:47:19,404
DDR! DDR!

1259
01:47:20,646 --> 01:47:25,948
This team that emerged from the
ghettos has left everyone far behind.

1260
01:47:25,985 --> 01:47:29,148
ln fact, this team has captured
the hearts of millions.

1261
01:47:29,221 --> 01:47:33,920
lf people are so excited out here, imagine
what it must be like in the DDR green room.

1262
01:47:37,296 --> 01:47:40,231
Biscuit, leave her alone.

1263
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:42,197
Wow! Beautiful!

1264
01:47:42,268 --> 01:47:45,032
You look stunning.

1265
01:47:45,104 --> 01:47:46,696
You look fabulous too.

1266
01:47:46,772 --> 01:47:49,832
Anyway... where's Chandu?

1267
01:47:49,909 --> 01:47:51,171
He said he might be late.

1268
01:47:56,782 --> 01:47:58,909
Where have you been, Chandu?

1269
01:47:58,985 --> 01:48:01,351
Forgotten your old friends, have you?

1270
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,211
Babu!

1271
01:48:02,288 --> 01:48:03,277
Chandu!

1272
01:48:03,356 --> 01:48:04,288
What's up?

1273
01:48:04,357 --> 01:48:06,348
l know where he is.

1274
01:48:06,993 --> 01:48:10,087
Where? Tell me!

1275
01:48:10,129 --> 01:48:11,118
lt's a surprise!

1276
01:48:11,197 --> 01:48:12,255
l'm happy for you.

1277
01:48:12,331 --> 01:48:14,231
l wish you luck...

1278
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:15,995
and l hope you can buy more rings.

1279
01:48:16,068 --> 01:48:17,000
Thanks!

1280
01:48:17,069 --> 01:48:19,094
But l'm in a hurry... see you later.

1281
01:48:19,171 --> 01:48:23,267
After the performance,
Chandu will...

1282
01:48:23,309 --> 01:48:25,869
Have you lost it?
l have to perform in 2 hours...

1283
01:48:25,945 --> 01:48:27,674
and you're telling me to have a drag.

1284
01:48:27,747 --> 01:48:28,907
Rhea!

1285
01:48:28,981 --> 01:48:31,916
Look at her, she's blushing!

1286
01:48:32,318 --> 01:48:33,751
Have a drag...

1287
01:48:33,819 --> 01:48:35,844
for old time's sake!

1288
01:48:37,156 --> 01:48:38,418
How touching!

1289
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:40,758
For old time's sake?

1290
01:48:42,728 --> 01:48:44,923
Friends help us live...

1291
01:48:46,298 --> 01:48:47,788
not die!

1292
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:52,967
lf l were a guy, Chandu would've
had to compete with me.

1293
01:48:53,672 --> 01:48:55,037
lt's his money talking.

1294
01:48:55,107 --> 01:48:56,233
Think you're smart, eh?

1295
01:48:56,308 --> 01:48:57,673
You're showing off to us?

1296
01:48:57,743 --> 01:48:58,937
Let's go.

1297
01:48:59,178 --> 01:49:00,611
Step back!

1298
01:49:01,113 --> 01:49:02,080
Let's go.

1299
01:49:04,984 --> 01:49:06,315
Give me back my ring.

1300
01:49:17,029 --> 01:49:19,827
His phone is switched off.

1301
01:49:20,232 --> 01:49:23,258
We shouldn't have trusted Chandu.

1302
01:49:24,203 --> 01:49:26,000
We're on next.

1303
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,133
Sir, Chandu is not here yet.

1304
01:49:31,377 --> 01:49:35,370
You said you trusted him.

1305
01:49:35,648 --> 01:49:36,910
l mean...

1306
01:49:37,383 --> 01:49:39,146
he has betrayed you again.

1307
01:49:43,322 --> 01:49:45,119
l agree with you.

1308
01:49:47,093 --> 01:49:49,288
Chandu is a traitor.

1309
01:49:57,436 --> 01:50:01,338
He has betrayed all of us.

1310
01:50:40,779 --> 01:50:45,182
Gopi is waiting for
us at the hospital.

1311
01:50:50,289 --> 01:50:52,314
We need to claim his body.

1312
01:50:57,897 --> 01:50:59,922
Sir, can we leave after 10 minutes?

1313
01:51:01,967 --> 01:51:03,127
Please?

1314
01:54:21,166 --> 01:54:22,394
No...

1315
01:54:38,951 --> 01:54:40,282
Chandu...

1316
01:54:41,387 --> 01:54:44,413
Who among you is family?

1317
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:49,186
We all are!

1318
01:54:53,232 --> 01:54:56,224
We found this in his pocket.

1319
01:56:20,152 --> 01:56:21,244
Vishnu...

1320
01:56:22,855 --> 01:56:24,720
we've made it to the finals.

1321
01:57:34,359 --> 01:57:36,020
Mediocrity is king.

1322
01:57:36,328 --> 01:57:38,796
Talk some sense into him!

1323
01:57:38,864 --> 01:57:39,956
DDR has the public's sympathy...

1324
01:57:40,032 --> 01:57:41,659
they are the underdogs now.

1325
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:43,925
Tell him to do what l say.

1326
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:46,137
lf l lose my patience...

1327
01:57:46,204 --> 01:57:47,671
l will send him back
to where he came from!

1328
01:59:31,109 --> 01:59:34,010
Competitions... Ramp-walks...

1329
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:37,378
lnternational shows... World tours...

1330
01:59:37,649 --> 01:59:39,708
You can have it all...

1331
01:59:39,785 --> 01:59:41,650
if you join my team.

1332
01:59:41,787 --> 01:59:43,687
But if you stay with Vishnu...

1333
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:50,285
Let's assume for a minute...

1334
01:59:50,362 --> 01:59:53,058
that you've won the competition.

1335
01:59:53,131 --> 01:59:54,723
But, what next?

1336
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:57,063
Think about it...

1337
01:59:58,937 --> 02:00:00,734
lt is your career...

1338
02:00:02,207 --> 02:00:03,231
right?

1339
02:00:04,676 --> 02:00:06,337
You can take 10 minutes to decide.

1340
02:00:07,045 --> 02:00:09,980
This is the contract,
that's the pen.

1341
02:00:12,017 --> 02:00:13,780
10 minutes...

1342
02:00:13,852 --> 02:00:14,819
No, sir!

1343
02:00:15,787 --> 02:00:17,914
We had decided that...

1344
02:00:18,023 --> 02:00:23,325
there's nothing you could offer
to turn us against Vishnu sir.

1345
02:00:24,229 --> 02:00:25,856
But we came here because...

1346
02:00:25,964 --> 02:00:27,431
Rhea told us that...

1347
02:00:27,733 --> 02:00:30,463
the look on your face when
you're screwed is priceless!

1348
02:00:31,103 --> 02:00:32,400
Good day, sir!

1349
02:00:35,273 --> 02:00:37,468
He thought he could buy our loyalty?

1350
02:00:37,743 --> 02:00:39,370
That was classic!

1351
02:00:40,412 --> 02:00:41,845
Zip!

1352
02:00:45,784 --> 02:00:47,251
Come on, Mayur.

1353
02:00:47,319 --> 02:00:48,786
Yeah!

1354
02:00:48,854 --> 02:00:49,752
Where do you want to go?

1355
02:00:49,821 --> 02:00:51,721
To meet Jehangir sir.

1356
02:00:52,157 --> 02:00:53,818
Okay.

1357
02:00:55,861 --> 02:00:57,021
Rocky...

1358
02:00:57,362 --> 02:00:58,351
What?

1359
02:00:59,364 --> 02:01:00,194
Nothing.

1360
02:01:00,232 --> 02:01:01,893
What is it?

1361
02:01:01,933 --> 02:01:03,901
l thought l saw D.

1362
02:01:03,935 --> 02:01:06,199
D? Over here?

1363
02:01:06,705 --> 02:01:07,296
Are you crazy?

1364
02:01:07,372 --> 02:01:08,202
Why would he come here?

1365
02:01:08,273 --> 02:01:09,103
You're mistaken.

1366
02:01:09,174 --> 02:01:09,936
Let's go!

1367
02:01:10,008 --> 02:01:11,236
Stop messing around.

1368
02:01:11,309 --> 02:01:13,209
Ready?

1369
02:01:13,478 --> 02:01:14,467
lmraan, lights.

1370
02:01:57,389 --> 02:01:58,754
Vishnu...

1371
02:01:59,758 --> 02:02:00,782
all set?

1372
02:02:04,763 --> 02:02:06,924
Leaving JDC was a mistake.

1373
02:02:09,234 --> 02:02:11,395
But coming back to
the competition is...

1374
02:02:13,104 --> 02:02:14,833
a bigger mistake.

1375
02:02:17,042 --> 02:02:18,373
Did you really think...

1376
02:02:18,677 --> 02:02:20,076
that everyone would praise you?

1377
02:02:20,111 --> 02:02:21,203
Huh?

1378
02:02:23,181 --> 02:02:25,308
You've made a big mistake...

1379
02:02:26,384 --> 02:02:28,215
by messing with Jehangir Khan.

1380
02:02:30,188 --> 02:02:35,285
The grand finale of Close up Dance Dil
Se powered by Spinz is finally here.

1381
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:39,456
The dance show that has captured
the hearts of a million lndians...

1382
02:02:39,731 --> 02:02:44,065
and brought everything
to a standstill...

1383
02:02:44,135 --> 02:02:46,729
is about to begin.

1384
02:02:46,805 --> 02:02:50,366
The biggest entertainment
show of lndia.

1385
02:03:03,021 --> 02:03:05,683
Guys, you are fabulous.

1386
02:03:05,757 --> 02:03:08,157
Our concept is out of this world.

1387
02:03:08,226 --> 02:03:09,158
You think we'll win?

1388
02:03:09,227 --> 02:03:10,387
Of course.

1389
02:03:10,729 --> 02:03:11,320
Gopi!

1390
02:03:11,396 --> 02:03:12,954
We will win.

1391
02:03:19,271 --> 02:03:25,005
ln a last minute change DDR is
now going to close tonight's finale.

1392
02:03:25,076 --> 02:03:27,101
l guess the organizers
have realized that...

1393
02:03:27,178 --> 02:03:30,147
everyone in lndia is rooting for them.

1394
02:03:30,215 --> 02:03:35,710
So the first performance is by
Jehangir Khan's defending champions.

1395
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,919
Are you guys ready?

1396
02:04:28,707 --> 02:04:29,833
Sir...

1397
02:04:29,908 --> 02:04:31,034
That's our theme.

1398
02:04:40,752 --> 02:04:42,151
They stole our entire act!

1399
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:43,448
That's cheating, Vishnu.

1400
02:04:43,722 --> 02:04:45,189
That no-good slimeball Jehangir.

1401
02:05:05,744 --> 02:05:07,803
Trust me it's one of us.

1402
02:05:08,246 --> 02:05:09,975
And l know who it is.

1403
02:05:16,855 --> 02:05:19,016
l saw him at JDC.

1404
02:05:19,090 --> 02:05:20,785
Saw whom?

1405
02:05:20,859 --> 02:05:21,917
l saw D.

1406
02:05:21,993 --> 02:05:23,119
What?

1407
02:05:23,161 --> 02:05:24,822
D was here a minute ago...

1408
02:05:24,896 --> 02:05:26,420
But he isn't here now!

1409
02:05:26,698 --> 02:05:29,030
Who do you think
is doing those steps?

1410
02:05:37,208 --> 02:05:39,176
Dude! Did you see that?

1411
02:05:39,244 --> 02:05:41,178
Sir, they are doing our dance.

1412
02:05:41,246 --> 02:05:43,146
D is here.

1413
02:05:43,214 --> 02:05:45,842
lf D is here, then who is that?

1414
02:06:13,945 --> 02:06:15,207
Superb!

1415
02:06:31,329 --> 02:06:32,387
Damn good!

1416
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:36,764
Wow! What a smashing performance.

1417
02:06:36,835 --> 02:06:41,135
JDC have proved that
they are the champions.

1418
02:07:03,394 --> 02:07:05,259
How could you do that?

1419
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:08,766
l don't want to play
second fiddle to you all my life!

1420
02:07:09,701 --> 02:07:11,032
Another thing...

1421
02:07:11,836 --> 02:07:13,667
l'm the lead dancer at JDC.

1422
02:07:13,738 --> 02:07:14,295
Get lost!

1423
02:07:14,372 --> 02:07:15,737
You get lost!

1424
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:17,874
l don't want to end
up like Vishnu sir.

1425
02:07:19,010 --> 02:07:21,069
Step back...

1426
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:25,406
All of you step back!

1427
02:07:28,153 --> 02:07:29,745
Didn't you hear me?

1428
02:07:30,889 --> 02:07:31,947
Step back!

1429
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,657
So Gopi...

1430
02:07:38,296 --> 02:07:40,924
doesn't this fighting
remind you of your ghetto?

1431
02:07:42,767 --> 02:07:46,703
'The only thing l can do is teach
dance', isn't that what you said?

1432
02:07:47,405 --> 02:07:49,737
And, what you taught...
was performed.

1433
02:07:52,076 --> 02:07:54,101
What will you teach your team now?.

1434
02:07:57,715 --> 02:07:58,875
ln 10 minutes...

1435
02:08:12,397 --> 02:08:15,798
So guys, what do you think
who will win?

1436
02:08:15,867 --> 02:08:18,802
JDC! JDC!

1437
02:08:39,023 --> 02:08:41,116
What's the matter?

1438
02:08:41,159 --> 02:08:43,252
What's with the long faces?

1439
02:08:43,294 --> 02:08:45,228
We have won!

1440
02:08:46,764 --> 02:08:49,631
JDC stole our routine.

1441
02:08:49,701 --> 02:08:51,328
We've already won this competition.

1442
02:08:51,603 --> 02:08:53,127
lt's time to celebrate.

1443
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:57,369
But what do we do
for our performance?

1444
02:08:57,642 --> 02:08:59,109
We're up next!

1445
02:09:02,347 --> 02:09:05,839
You will perform the dance
that every lndian knows.

1446
02:09:07,785 --> 02:09:12,085
A dance that brings people together.

1447
02:09:12,357 --> 02:09:16,020
A dance that you can't
merely sit and watch.

1448
02:09:16,094 --> 02:09:18,756
lt will make you want to
get up and dance.

1449
02:09:18,796 --> 02:09:23,130
A dance that hasn't
changed for years...

1450
02:09:23,334 --> 02:09:25,029
it's performed at weddings...

1451
02:09:25,069 --> 02:09:28,300
it's performed when
lndia wins a cricket match...

1452
02:09:29,274 --> 02:09:31,139
it's performed when we
dance at the Ganpati Festival.

1453
02:09:31,342 --> 02:09:35,836
The only dance that
follows no discipline.

1454
02:09:37,649 --> 02:09:38,843
lt follows the heart.

1455
02:09:41,119 --> 02:09:42,245
A-B-C-D

1456
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:43,981
Any Body Can Dance.

1457
02:09:45,857 --> 02:09:47,347
Any Body Can Dance!

1458
02:09:47,859 --> 02:09:49,053
Yeah!

1459
02:10:20,925 --> 02:10:22,916
Everybody join in.

1460
02:10:33,738 --> 02:10:36,298
That was a superb
classical performance!

1461
02:10:36,374 --> 02:10:38,774
And now brace yourself...

1462
02:10:38,843 --> 02:10:41,004
for the last act of Dance Dil Se...

1463
02:10:41,079 --> 02:10:42,842
DDR!

1464
02:12:03,127 --> 02:12:04,355
Ganpati Bappa Morya.

1465
02:18:57,208 --> 02:18:58,698
Vishnu...

1466
02:19:04,381 --> 02:19:06,212
You're the best.

1467
02:19:07,351 --> 02:19:10,878
You fixed everything.

1468
02:19:12,656 --> 02:19:15,056
lf every neighbourhood
had someone like you...

1469
02:19:15,159 --> 02:19:17,992
everything would be perfect.

1470
02:22:29,186 --> 02:22:31,177
Gopi...

1471
02:22:31,422 --> 02:22:33,049
what happened?
