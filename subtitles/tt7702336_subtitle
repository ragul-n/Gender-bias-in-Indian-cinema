2
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,621
What happened?

3
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,057
Why are you standing here?

4
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,226
She went to the town to
see an ophthalmologist

5
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,769
Icannottravel by bus, since
I am having knee pain

6
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,278
I heard some chaotic scenes
occurred in the town

7
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,041
Hardly, l have seen any
bus from the town

8
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,370
I hope she is safe

9
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,644
No need to panic,
We can search

10
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,566
Oh Lord!

11
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,757
-Are you scared?
-Yes

12
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,143
At that time she came as
an angel to help me.

13
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,496
Dear Muthumani

14
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,432
Smile like a flower

15
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,304
If you smile well, your mother
can see you from the heaven

16
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,465
Let me tell a story

17
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,476
Smile dear

18
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,841
- Dear Muthumani
- Father!

19
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,278
Father

20
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,338
Muthumani

21
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,644
Dear, Don't go

22
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,189
- Father
- Dear Muthumani

23
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,268
- Muthumani
- Father

24
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,788
Muthumani

25
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,818
Oh my dear

26
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,088
But you are very smart
in observation

27
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,340
and high concentration is needed

28
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,502
When are you going?

29
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,569
Tomorrow

30
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,077
Didn't you clear the doubts yet?

31
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:13,037
Your mother used to ask me this
question when you were a kid

32
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,224
When I select something for you

33
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,364
Twenty years ago people
didn't have an idea..

34
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,819
...about a private detective agency

35
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,760
All over in India they
rank 4th or 5th position

36
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,765
They are the undisputed
agency in the South India

37
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,317
So you are happy

38
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:04,186
If your motherwas alive, she will
not let you go farfor ajob

39
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,296
You are going to be alone

40
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,766
After some time your child will
ask this question to you also

41
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,569
At that time you won't
have an answer

42
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,812
It is the melody of life

43
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,443
Good bye dear

44
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:54,784
Where are you going
to stay in Kochi

45
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,895
With Avinash, He is the last word
inthe film industry

46
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,314
So boys and girls,
Howwas the music?

47
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:41,895
Sir, did you come early

48
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:45,658
How many songs you
have sung before this

49
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,139
Why can't you be punctual
foryour Debut song?

50
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,970
Even a legendary singer
won't do this to me

51
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:54,787
Traffic block

52
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,321
But music has evolved much
before than that

53
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:06,536
My music and lyrics will not
change for any singers

54
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,621
Sir, you must not,
No need for it

55
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,016
- Song will be very tough
-Sir, I know

56
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,240
Sir, you are the kingpin in the
Malayalam music industry

57
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,115
Let's check the tune

58
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,175
0h lord, help me

59
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,912
Ready 1.. 2.. 3.. 5..

60
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,935
Music should come from your
throat and not from your hand

61
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:49,966
Give him the lyrics

62
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,317
Lady you come here, None ofthe singers
went in vain from my team

63
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,739
My Lord, Letthis song brings next level
of success to the Music Industry

64
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,385
All the best my boy

65
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,744
Mr. Avinash, Your career is on
that small piece of paper

66
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,986
I told you know, it will
be a tough song

67
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,354
A kid called Kuttan..
Kuttan has a dog..

68
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,795
Adog called Kittan..
It has a puppy..

69
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,639
That is Kuttan's puppy..

70
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,650
A kid called Kuttan..
Kuttan has a dog..

71
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,776
-A dog called Kittan..
- No stop it

72
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,235
You must sing with the
love and affection of a dog

73
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,134
You do one thing,
You just bark

74
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:54,918
Do it, Avinash

75
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,038
No tune is there

76
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,067
You are barking like a stray dog

77
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:09,205
Not like that,
You must bark with a feel

78
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,149
No, Bark with a motherly feel

79
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,378
Don't they have motherly feelings?

80
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,896
Sir, 
 feel like laugh out loud

81
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,084
Come outside

82
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,311
How can you sing a song if
you can't bark properly

83
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,906
You don't have a chance in my
Children animation movie

84
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,820
I don't want your chance, ldiot

85
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:53,256
Let your singing career bite
the dust and goes to hell

86
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,193
Get lost

87
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,407
Come on Dude

88
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,988
Howwas your first song?

89
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,193
Song was super,
But it was a tough one

90
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:09,862
Is it a classical one?

91
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,849
Initially it was classical, and
then it became a mass one

92
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,775
So it was a variety one

93
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,271
A kid called Kuttan..
Kuttan has a dog..

94
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:26,793
- Best wishes
- Thank you

95
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,760
Where are you going?
To guest house

96
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,884
Really?

97
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,144
Nowadays alike mosquitoes, singers
are also cumbersome in Kochi

98
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,110
Sol must struggle,
But I trust my voice

99
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,495
Super, Okay then

100
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,187
I am Arjun Ram,
New appointment

101
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,149
Hello madam

102
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,256
Arjun, take your seat

103
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:44,848
Thank you

104
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,605
My c.v

105
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,073
University topper in criminology

106
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,947
anti terrorism and
law after criminology

107
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,026
Then, why did you come
for a private detective job

108
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,280
Criminology does not settle
with finding the crime

109
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,603
but also teaches how to
prevent that crime

110
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,934
So you find a social angle
in this profession

111
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,297
-Would you like tea or coffee
- No madam, Thanks

112
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,436
What do you think the most important
factor required forthis job?

113
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:45,398
Some MNC and insurance firms used to tell
us to monitortheir staffs and customers

114
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,840
Your first phase will be like this

115
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,149
We can secretly monitorthem

116
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,810
But no personal contacts
and no relationships

117
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:59,952
Our client takes decisions purely based
on the reports given by us

118
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,602
So it must be accurate and secret

119
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,705
13 steps

120
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,058
Good, Any other
observations

121
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,067
Mad am, Your favourite
writer is Mad havikutty

122
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,376
How did you know that?

123
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:36,279
There are 104 law related
books in the shelf

124
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,749
But still you find a space
for Madhavikutty's Book

125
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,376
Exactly

126
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,998
And something about your shirt

127
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,247
What

128
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,347
May be due to your
busy schedule

129
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,534
You forgot to take
out the collar pull

130
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,475
Thanks

131
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,974

She is living for their dreams

318
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,442
She was stamped as orphan, when

"The first feel of love turned

416
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,344
"Turn into the musical
rhythm of love"

417
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:46,634

00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,199
Madam, l have mailed the
details of Antony

419
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,138
And these are
the hard copies

420
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,663
He loves to roam
behind girls

421
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,738
It's hard to trust whoever
runs behind girls

422
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,674
Whether it is Antony
orArjun

423
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:25,770
What is your motive behind
roaming with Andrea

424
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:31,973
Shut up

425
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:50,551
Do you think you are the back born of
Hawks Eye after two assignments

426
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,718
Or Can you move
out of my radar

427
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:55,367

I don't want a
Romantic hero here

00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,390
Only because
of my interest

430
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,056
You need not have to
monitorAndrea's case

431
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,191
Ask herto go to hell, Who is she to
decide your life

432
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,028
This is pure jealous, Because she didn't
get you to share her love

433
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,601
If she badly need someone,
Ask her to love me

434
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,547
I can sacrifice
my life for you

435
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:40,168
l m ust not have forgotten
the company rules

436
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:45,718
What sort of a lady is that

437
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:48,424
You will get a better
job than this

438
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:52,515
So you must marry
her now itself

439
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,771
Tomorrow11'itself you must start a
detective agency of your own

440
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,219
And"1'day after tomorrow11'we

441
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,232

her into pieces

442
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,373
l have to correct
my mistake

443
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,180
She will get the
mouthful now

444
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:11,540
Dude, It is Andrea

445
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:15,676
- Don't answer,
-As your wish

446
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,327

452
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:43,717

454
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,047

For what?

00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,250
She was living with an
intoxicated rascal

459
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,952
He used to hit
her everyday

460
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,518
He used to make injuries on
her with knife also

461
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,874
I'm so much depressed
about her, So I took her

462
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,561
People used to say big
Quotations on love

463
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,235
But, you have simply shown
the real magic of love

464

Four ofthem have
died in an accident

615
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:28,418
All accidents were preplanned
by Arjun's theory

616
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:33,107
According to your plan,
only Andrea is remaining

617
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:42,718
Where should I
categorise you

618
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,420
Because, it was part of my job

619
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:12,944
Whatever crap

620
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:18,687
But, your silence after these murders
implies something bad

621
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,339
Your silence indicates that, you have
played a key role in all murders

622
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,799
Sir, trust me,
lam trying to help them

623

completed test, training and pledge

...like us to help the people

626
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:46,195
How can a private dick agency
can take the law and order

627
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:51,396
You and your office is under
the shadow of suspicion

628
01:29:52,653 --> 01:29:53,642
Where is your office?

629
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:22,129
Generally there won't
be any holidays

630
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:25,688
Mr. Devarajan, Go on

631
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,690
Dear, Arjun

632
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:55,718

- Office where I worked

638
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,598
Bhaskaran, The matter
is bit serious

639
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,197
How long you are using
this place as your godown

640
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:27,603
An Agent from the market
arranged this building for me

641
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,860
Sir, this building was completely
vacant when I reached here

642
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:38,226
Devaraj, You go with him to
the market and see...

643
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:42,483
Meet him, And take
both to my office

644
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,392
Sir, I am innocent

645
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:47,851
Bhaskaran, Please
cooperate with us

646
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:49,725
We must do our duty

647
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:51,403
Come Bhaskaran

648
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:54,628
-Why should I come with you
- We are not going tojail

649
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:03,654
Sir, I can't believe this

650
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:06,150
Come

651
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:13,230
Arjun's father is Ram Mohan
who is a retired KSEB engineer

652
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:15,673
Arjun got First rank holder
in MA criminology

653
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:19,278
We enquired about him,
He got a clean image

654
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:22,375
No criminal records at all

655
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:24,610
No criminal records at all

656
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,612
They have deleted all the details about
the Hawks Eye from the Google

657
01:32:36,017 --> 01:32:37,530
There is no company
in existence now

658
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:39,598
Wonderful,
Very nice

659
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:45,089
Generally certain finance
companies used to vanish a

..

660
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:47,605
...on a sudden after securing
deposits from the people

661
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:50,913
But, a detective agency
vanishing all on a sudden

662
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:58,583
...without any clue and
that too after 4 murders

663
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:05,404
Sir, Mobile ID of both Irene
and Gokul was fake

664
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:14,131
The first rank holder in criminology
and a keen observer like..

665
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:22,669
...you didn't take any pain to know
further about Irene and Gokul

666
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:27,355
At least their house

667
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:33,204
I didn't suspect them due to
the company's reputation

668
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:39,611
Mr. Williams sir,

669
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:09,688
So this is lrene

670
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:16,109
Twenty years ago Hawks Eye was started by a
retd. lPS officer called Alexander

671
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:42,680
Get him on the Skype call, ASAP

672
01:34:56,323 --> 01:34:59,451
Just doesn't connect, He is an
honest police officer

673
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:05,445
Sir, I want to know
the true story

674
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:08,796
And I want to find the
people who cheated me

675
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,009
I can do anything forthat

676
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:15,831
You must be with me

677
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:22,265
Because, I don't know your
role in the lrene's story

678
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:24,749
I still have my doubts

679
01:35:28,823 --> 01:35:30,779
- Andrea?
-Andrea is safe

680
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:33,972
Can! see her

681
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:41,658
We have made all
arrangements forthat

682
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:02,260
I spoke with Alexander now

683
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:05,220
Hawks Eye does not
belongs to him now

684
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:13,756
Six years ago, On November,
2011 he sold Hawks Eye

685
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:23,701
- Does lrene bought it?
- No

686
01:37:31,245 --> 01:37:33,896
He is nowthe owner
of Hawks Eye

687
01:37:37,151 --> 01:37:40,951
Alexander Sir, will mail his other
details and sale agreement

688
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:44,145
Rajaratnam

689
01:38:00,908 --> 01:38:01,727
Sir, Greetings

690
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:05,676
He rules the Thootthukkudi port

691
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,429
All the politicians and
police are under his belt

692
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:12,764
He is such a criminal

693
01:38:22,997 --> 01:38:25,830
So you all will have butterflies in your
stomach to play outside your comfort zone

694
01:38:29,937 --> 01:38:33,065
There are certain places
where police can't go directly

695
01:38:34,174 --> 01:38:38,292
Especially during the undercover
operations, they are very helpful

696
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:44,128
So, now we go directly
to Thootthukkudi

697
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:17,934
- Hey Wait
-We would like to meet Rajaratnam

698
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:21,513
- Okay, Nowyou stand outside
-We need a small favour

699
01:39:22,423 --> 01:39:24,436
-Where you are from?
- We are from Kerala

700
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:25,923

701
01:39:27,394 --> 01:39:29,999

Kerala to meet our boss

01:39:30,564 --> 01:39:32,020
I don't knowthem,
Go and tell him

703
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:33,094
Finish it

704
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:36,866
Boss, Somebody came from
Kerala to meet you

705
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:01,025
Who are you?
Why did you come this far?

706
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:03,766
I got a transfer
to this port

707
01:40:05,299 --> 01:40:07,187
So, you are an officer

708
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:09,586
So, you know one
have to meet me

709
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,559
Yes boss

710
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:13,909
-Who is this?
-This is my younger brother

711
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:17,064
Boss, we came to
fix a job for him

712
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,392
What is your qualification?

713
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,266
Sir, MA in Criminology

714
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:24,525
Criminal??

715
01:40:30,824 --> 01:40:31,927
Very true

716
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:37,319
Well, it helps to get a job in the
investigation department

717
01:40:42,102 --> 01:40:45,253
If you prefer any otherjob, then I have
to make a call to the ministry

718
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:49,079
He don't want ajob here
He need a job in Kerala

719
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:51,071
ln Kerala you got a private
detective agency know

720
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:53,016
If he gets a job there, it is easy for
him to travel from his house

721
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,631
- Hawks Eye
- Hawks Eye?

722
01:40:59,686 --> 01:41:03,019
Brother, my agency, office, etc
are here only

723
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,980
You might have forgot it,
You have

724
01:41:06,693 --> 01:41:09,116
ln Kerala you got
an office like that

725
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:12,419
Look, Is this your signature?

726
01:41:31,652 --> 01:41:33,961
They have travelled all the way
from Kerala to meet us

727
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:36,010
Let me ask

728
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:38,152
Brother, tell me, what you want?

729
01:41:38,492 --> 01:41:40,881
Only one question, What's your
connection with Kerala

730
01:41:41,795 --> 01:41:45,891
Not only in Kerala, I got connections
through out the south lndia

731
01:41:47,101 --> 01:41:49,467
The Hawks Eye agency
was registered in your name

732
01:41:50,537 --> 01:41:52,107
And we came here
to know about it

733
01:41:53,373 --> 01:41:55,853
No one comes here
for questioning

734
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:59,800
and those who came,
hadn't left also

735
01:42:00,747 --> 01:42:02,578
Hey, What's this

736
01:42:18,732 --> 01:42:22,270
Brother, you just settle score and call me
I will be in the vehicle

737
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:24,508
I will take care
of your glass

738
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:29,040
- Police

739
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:31,948
See that you take his
dead body from here

740
01:42:32,679 --> 01:42:34,374
Sure, boss,
As yourwish

741
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:00,995
Boss, Now whose dead
body should I take

742
01:45:05,032 --> 01:45:07,956
Sir, we don't want
to hurt you

743
01:45:09,836 --> 01:45:13,306
But, you must tell us the whole
story behind that agreement

744
01:45:20,113 --> 01:45:25,210
Six years ago, I went to
Kerala to accomplish a deal

745
01:45:27,054 --> 01:45:30,592
It was a crime work,
In that! made a signature

746
01:45:31,858 --> 01:45:33,257
Who made that deal?

747
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:38,276
Thatl don't remember

748
01:45:40,133 --> 01:45:41,771
But, there was a
girl in that group

749
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:02,451
Yes, This is the girl

750
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,184
This is the girl

751
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:23,507
We have taken complete accident and
death details ofthe past six years

752
01:46:24,077 --> 01:46:26,409
And we have sorted out the cases
which are yet to be proved

753
01:46:28,081 --> 01:46:29,560
l have mailed the
sorted list to you

754
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:52,579
Sir, Please go back

755
01:46:57,677 --> 01:46:58,746
l have seen her before

756
01:47:01,848 --> 01:47:03,486
This is Advocate Arundhathi

757
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:12,558
Yes, l have seen her photo
from the files of Irene

758
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:21,055
Sir, I am sure,
The same photo

759
01:47:23,470 --> 01:47:24,391
2011

760
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:29,552
In the same year lrene owned
Hawks Eye and Arundhathi"1'died

761
01:47:31,178 --> 01:47:32,634
Uncanny coincidence

762
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:37,633
There is some
connection in this

763
01:47:40,654 --> 01:47:43,612
We will get a clear picture, if we follow
Arundhathi"1'instead of Irene now

764
01:47:44,758 --> 01:47:48,467
Yes, Then it's Kollimala next

765
01:47:59,239 --> 01:48:01,719
Sir, we didn't get any evidences
from the accidents occurred here

766
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:04,345
Even the tribes are
afraid to climb down

767
01:48:05,212 --> 01:48:09,103
Without any evidences, How did you confirm
that it was Advocate Arundhathi

768
01:48:09,716 --> 01:48:13,186
On that day she dropped here
an old lady from the town

769
01:48:18,992 --> 01:48:21,415
Another accident also
occurred at the same time

770
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:26,597
Alittle girl, Her body recovered
from the top of a tree

771
01:48:27,734 --> 01:48:30,248
She is a daughter of a Tamil native,
He is the witness forthe two accidents

772
01:48:35,141 --> 01:48:36,301
Where is he nouf?

773
01:48:36,843 --> 01:48:39,619
He was here for sometime
with mental disorder

774
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:43,613
A social welfare group then
took him to a mental asylum

775
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:45,959
- Now he is there
- Muthumani

776
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:11,950
You must stay here,
You must play with me

777
01:49:13,346 --> 01:49:16,144
If you smile well, then your
motherwill see from the sky

778
01:49:17,183 --> 01:49:19,367
Smile.. Smile like amoon

779
01:49:26,326 --> 01:49:28,783
Murukeshan was here
for the last 5 years

780
01:49:32,299 --> 01:49:34,927
-About any relatives?
- No

781
01:49:35,702 --> 01:49:41,732
Apart from a baggage which contains
fewdresses and a small bag

782
01:49:43,143 --> 01:49:44,428
Can we see that

783
01:50:27,053 --> 01:50:28,714
We have reached the house of
Arud hadhi in Thanjavore

784
01:50:29,422 --> 01:50:31,026
Who is there nouf?

785
01:50:31,992 --> 01:50:36,126
Today we are going to explore
the place called Kollimala

786
01:50:36,763 --> 01:50:39,368
which is also known as mystery
potholes or devil fort

787
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,834
Thejourney with the
photographerArun

788
01:50:44,738 --> 01:50:48,424
was wonderful and
miraculously adventurous

789
01:50:49,209 --> 01:50:53,122
The native tribes
were our guide

790
01:50:53,913 --> 01:50:57,417
We got a chance to meet
a group of people..

791
01:50:58,018 --> 01:50:59,827
...with distinct language
and culture

792
01:51:00,186 --> 01:51:04,964
We were amazed to see a lady who
doe not belong to their tribe

793
01:51:05,825 --> 01:51:11,354
From the actions, we came to know
that she has fallen from the top

794
01:51:12,699 --> 01:51:19,047
Now with the help of government,
she was moved to the hospital

795
01:51:20,273 --> 01:51:23,253
The officials have recognised
that this Advocate Arundhathi..

796
01:51:23,843 --> 01:51:27,210
...who found missing due to an
accident six years ago

797
01:51:55,241 --> 01:51:58,802
Today, I heard about a lady called
Arundhathi"1'through media

798
01:52:02,449 --> 01:52:03,905
She is in ICU

799
01:52:04,484 --> 01:52:05,644
Who is this?

800
01:52:24,804 --> 01:52:25,725
- Excuse me
-Yes

801
01:52:25,972 --> 01:52:28,520
I learnt that a patient called
Arundhathi is in ICU

802
01:52:29,075 --> 01:52:30,588
-
CU is on the second floor
- Second floor

803
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:46,201
There is no miracle
in Kollimala

804
01:53:47,987 --> 01:53:50,262
...And Arund hathi"1'didn't
get a second life

805
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:58,426
When you have decided to disappear,
we have decided to see you again

806
01:54:05,071 --> 01:54:07,585
...You registered the Hawks Eye
in the name of Rajaratnam

807
01:54:08,541 --> 01:54:10,702
In between why
did you post me

808
01:54:13,179 --> 01:54:15,511
Arjun, initially
I suspected you

809
01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:18,514
So that's the reason

810
01:54:22,622 --> 01:54:30,711
There is a connection a between four
murders and Advocate Arund hathi

811
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:34,154
We got the evidence
forthat also

812
01:54:39,939 --> 01:54:41,224
The same iPhone

813
01:54:46,045 --> 01:54:52,280
We got it from the locker room of a mental
asylum as belongings of Murukeshan

814
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:58,424
This was used by Advocate
Arundhathi"1'till her death

815
01:55:04,063 --> 01:55:06,247
She got many incoming
calls to this number

816
01:55:06,666 --> 01:55:09,703
Four numbers called
her frequently

817
01:55:11,271 --> 01:55:14,047
The owners of those
4 numbers are..

818
01:55:14,641 --> 01:55:17,792
Adhithyan, Vijay, Krishnamoorthy
and Antony

819
01:55:22,482 --> 01:55:25,872
Did they kill Advocate Arundhathi?

820
01:55:35,261 --> 01:55:37,741
You knowthe correct
answerfor this

821
01:55:39,098 --> 01:55:43,376
Because, Advocate Arundhathi
is your mother

822
01:55:54,447 --> 01:55:57,245
Till the age of five,
you were in an orphanage

823
01:56:01,187 --> 01:56:05,021
One day they came to spread light to
vanish the darkness from your life

824
01:56:06,025 --> 01:56:09,449
Chidhabharam and his wife
Arundhathi"1'from Thanjavore

825
01:56:11,564 --> 01:56:15,625
Thus, Arundhathi
became your Foster-mother

826
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:41,081
-Are you going
-Yes

827
01:56:41,728 --> 01:56:47,462
You got a father and mother,
So you will get dresses and toys

828
01:56:48,735 --> 01:56:50,214
Then, will you forget me

829
01:56:51,004 --> 01:56:51,607
Dear, Mia

830
01:56:59,479 --> 01:57:02,778
Here by aunty will take
care of you also

831
01:57:03,449 --> 01:57:05,690
You will get same
things as Irene

832
01:57:06,753 --> 01:57:10,757
When you feel like talking to Irene,
then call to this number

833
01:57:42,321 --> 01:57:46,883
The day after you left,
Mia was missing

834
01:57:49,295 --> 01:57:56,724
"Missing," It's a bloody tag line given by
the police for the orphans like us

835
01:57:59,172 --> 01:58:02,130
Like my Mia, many
are still missing

836
01:58:02,775 --> 01:58:05,926
Do you know where, what
and how they are living

837
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:08,049
Do you have an
answer for that?

838
01:58:08,414 --> 01:58:10,427
Tell me, How many missing
children got their life back?

839
01:58:22,495 --> 01:58:25,180
Gradually, I forgot her

840
01:58:26,799 --> 01:58:29,074
Six years ago,
on one night

841
01:58:53,793 --> 01:58:54,953
Mia

842
01:58:57,463 --> 01:58:59,795
Where is she nouf?

843
01:59:06,672 --> 01:59:09,186
When we are waiting for
you in the positive hospital,

844
01:59:09,709 --> 01:59:11,404
Arjun shared a
doubt with me

845
01:59:12,545 --> 01:59:18,836
That is, Irene will share the news about
your mother to the closest friend

846
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:27,846
You made two calls
from the phone booth

847
01:59:28,594 --> 01:59:30,107
One to the hospital

848
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:33,278
...and the second
went to my house

849
01:59:34,367 --> 01:59:36,915
To Andrea

850
01:59:39,405 --> 01:59:43,739
Because, your Mia
is the Andrea now

851
02:00:06,499 --> 02:00:09,218
What happened
after that

852
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:21,758
Where were you?

853
02:01:02,822 --> 02:01:06,326
- Is it your house?
- No, I am an orphan

854
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:15,218
My friend's address

855
02:01:19,305 --> 02:01:20,636
It is far away from here

856
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:22,634
Should uncle take
you there?

857
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:23,421
Okay

858
02:02:21,801 --> 02:02:22,529
Antony

859
02:03:29,802 --> 02:03:31,724
Don't spare them

860
02:03:41,981 --> 02:03:44,404
My mother came here to
enquire about them

861
02:03:45,451 --> 02:03:47,555
The next day, we heard
her death news

862
02:04:17,817 --> 02:04:21,321
Gokul, Shekar and Manu are the
sponsored children of my foster-mother

863
02:04:22,788 --> 02:04:25,120
They have also
joined with us

864
02:04:27,927 --> 02:04:34,662
Thus, we have decided
to live, win and kill"1'them

865
02:06:08,794 --> 02:06:11,809
To confuse you they have
told you to follow me

866
02:06:14,667 --> 02:06:18,262
But, finally my mind
got confused

867
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:53,883
Nowyou know all
the story about her

868
02:06:54,373 --> 02:06:55,567
Do you still love her?

869
02:06:58,877 --> 02:07:00,481
What is the mistake
from her ward?

870
02:07:01,614 --> 02:07:05,209
Is it for killing these third rates,
she became a victim of rape

871
02:07:06,652 --> 02:07:11,442
...in her adolescent age and
also sold herself later

872
02:07:14,326 --> 02:07:16,544
The Iawwhich couldn't
safeguard her life

873
02:07:18,664 --> 02:07:19,619
Let the law
punish her

874
02:07:21,333 --> 02:07:23,312
She is not an
orphan anymore

875
02:07:23,969 --> 02:07:25,482
I will be there for her

876
02:07:32,111 --> 02:07:34,568
There are many criminals still
floating without any issue

877
02:07:35,014 --> 02:07:37,903
And there are criminals who didn't
get sufficient punishment also

878
02:07:40,019 --> 02:07:45,639
Let these four murders reside in the format
of an answer less accidental death

879
02:07:48,694 --> 02:07:51,413
Every police man has a emotional
affection to the human being

880
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:54,811
Nowthis story is common
to four of us only

881
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:56,551
Let it be like that

882
02:07:59,972 --> 02:08:03,396
Let's do it for
our young girls

02:08:03,396 --> 02:08:13,380
