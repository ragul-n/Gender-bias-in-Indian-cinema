1
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,082
Who can say what they will
become when they grow up?

2
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,479
Except their destiny

00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,620
lts said that many childrens
born with their destiny

4
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,458
And some childrens make their
destiny with their hard work

5
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:54,429
And many children's destiny you
make from their face

6

273
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:08,742

330
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:16,299
I dont have any choice

331
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,835

332
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:24,836

334
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:33,144
I have wasted my 6 years

335
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,690
I'm destroying from inside

336
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:57,175
I wish anyone can come and hold my hand
and say this is the way

337
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,891

338
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:18,290
like them

339
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,646
this is brain

340
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,382
and this is heart.
Why are you so emotional?

341
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:15,122
Film making is also a business

342
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,088
this is the problem

343
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:19,458
my brain is connected with my heart

344
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:24,995
and one day your brain will also
be connected with your heart

345
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:29,463
and you will run after Sameer

346
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:32,470
because he has lots of talent

347
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:37,937
and you know this. And he'll be a star.
I know this

348
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:31,022
how can a person live in car?

349
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:36,002
If a person manage a house then
he can live in car too

350
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,463
what he eats?

351
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,340
How can this be possible?
He wear cool clothes

352
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:48,881
all these are fake.
They are sold near train station

353
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,080
it means sir dont have money

354
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:04,390
we all have decided that we wont
tease anyone

355
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:08,251

356
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,321

01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:27,844
we never come first in anything

361
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:32,445
what do you think is there
any chance for us?

362
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,324
Ofcourse there is a chance for you

363
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:43,020

you are there at the contest

386
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:43,283
if you were doing the film then
I could also do

387
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,490

388
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,263

393
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,822

394
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,593

395
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:58,151
what is this?

396
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:03,487
Nothing.
Yesterday i imagine

397
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:09,458
someone told me that i do

398
01:26:10,031 --> 01:26:13,558
I'm a good actor and good looking too

399
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:16,567
just a bit good looking

400
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:23,372
i think about it alot

401
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:29,708

everybody will happy

402
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:37,014

405
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:11,920
I forget to tell you the most
important thing

406
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:24,143
life is a song,
sing it

407
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:26,446
life is voice,
say it

408
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:31,911
what is life?

409
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:37,456
Why kinda lines these are?

410
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:39,226
I cant feel anything

411
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:48,424
everything will be fine

412
01:31:49,303 --> 01:31:51,271
you will go in finals for sure

413
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:00,146
what is life?

414
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:02,910
Life is a game

415
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:04,178
play with it

416
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,282
life is a song,
sing it

417
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:54,792
my mom liked my performance

418
01:32:56,737 --> 01:33:00,264
my mom thought I'm the most good
looking child of the world

419
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:05,807
I didn't see anything like that in me

420
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:13,918
when my mom passed away

421
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:19,287
then I tried to see me from her eyes

422
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:26,492
then her all wishes become my confidence

423
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:34,699
in Capital cinema after every friday when
I see all the big stars

424
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:37,374
I asked myself

425
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:40,004
what is in them?
That is not in me?

426
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:44,745
Then I came to Mumbai

427
01:33:48,422 --> 01:33:51,357
that big screen is waiting for me

428
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:04,328
I came to know that darkness is also
outside the theatre

429
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:12,735
there is more acting beside screen as
compare to screen

430
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:17,381
wherever i go, i see 300 persons
like me

431
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:21,319

432
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:29,963
