1
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,749
Everybody put your hands
up in the air now.

2
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,091
Her eyes hide some expressions..

3
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,925
..something unspoken
yet mesmerizing!

4
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,766
Her eyes hide some expressions..

5
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,772
..something unspoken
yet mesmerizing!

6
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,776
They spellbind me to make
me lose all control!

7
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,835
'l looked at you,
you looked at me..

8
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,107
And it created all the troubles.

9
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,306
And you became my destiny.

10
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,783
You are the purpose of my life.

11
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:04,187
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

12
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,784
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

13
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,855
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

14
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,958
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

15
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:48,095
Never was heart like this before.

16
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,104
Who compelled it to go
astray with such dreams?

17
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,836
Now all that my eyes behold is her.

18
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,846
Why was I so reckless
as to make her mine!

19
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,850
Life seems to have become even
more difficult than death.

20
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:09,855
Costing me with myself.

21
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,916
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

22
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,860
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

23
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,864
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

24
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,928
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

25
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,399
Her eyes hide some expressions..

26
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,534
..something unspoken
yet mesmerizing!

27
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:35,877
They spellbind me to make
me lose all control!

28
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,883
'l looked at you,
you looked at me..

29
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,885
And it created all the troubles.

30
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,887
And you became my destiny..

31
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,549
You are the purpose of my life.

32
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:48,890
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

33
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,898
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

34
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:57,893
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

35
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,906
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

36
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,977
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

37
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:18,251
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

38
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,926
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

39
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,592
She stole my heart under
various pretexts!

40
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,966
Every passing minute witnesses
billions being spent..

41
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,131
..all over the world
to counter terrorism.

42
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,972
And with each of these
passing moments..

43
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:15,140
..terrorists make a new plan to
do something far more dreadful.

44
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,983
Maybe in some other
part of the world..

45
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,451
..precisely at this moment in time.

46
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,727
Very good. Very good.

47
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,670
Nobody comes to know of anything
when terrorists lose everyday.

48
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,080
However, any of those days,
when they happen to win..

49
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,412
..the loss to the human
life is immense.

50
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,077
Nobody knows how many officers..

51
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,421
..work day and night to turn
their victories into defeat.

52
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,095
We have intelligence information..

53
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,099
..that the terrorists are planning..

54
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,102
..something heinous seven
days from now on the 10th..

55
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,765
.., which will kill at least
twenty five thousand people.

56
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,267
When? Where? How?

57
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,607
We don't know anything.

58
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,781
They have plans, network
and the targets.

59
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,785
And all that we have is seven days.

60
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,144
The car that you see in front..

61
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,146
..is the same car which
is said to have a bomb.

62
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,808
The entire Anti Terrorist
Cell is present here.

63
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,407
And it is hoped that
they would be able to bring..

64
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,420
..this grave
situation under control.

65
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,875
That's good, we will be free.

66
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,708
Shashank..
- What?

67
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,216
He won't let the bomb explode!.

68
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,220
Don't look back. Ragvan..
- Sir.

69
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:31,431
Check if someone is spying on us
from the building. - Right sir.

70
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,738
Sir, you are right. There indeed
are some people on rooftop.

71
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,240
They are the ones spying on us.

72
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,777
Aditi, Ragvan, Pawar, come with me.

73
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,255
Shashank and Roy, you cover
us from this building.

74
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:57,422
And Shashank, shoot only when
absolutely needed. - Sir.

75
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,323
Who the hell smokes on duty here?

76
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,263
Roy, let's move.

77
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,622
Nobody will come from outside.
Understood?

78
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,446
Shashank.

79
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,386
Shashank.

80
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,329
We have been deceived again.
- Why so?

81
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,333
The bombs we diffused
during our training..

82
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,335
..had their wires in
either red or green.

83
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,337
All the wires here are
white, my friend.

84
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,865
Figure something out.

85
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,999
Yes, I will. You know that.

86
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,037
Hands up.

87
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,379
Aditi, caught on the west wing sir.

88
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,380
How many people?

89
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,385
Four. Two of yours and two of mine.

90
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,047
We'll see.
- I still don't have a shot, Aditi.

91
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,411
Two for you, two for me, isn't it?

92
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,543
What?

93
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,442
OPC 1 6 has diffused
the bomb in the car.

94
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,450
There was a gun fight in the
nearby building resulting..

95
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,452
.. in a terrorist's arrest.

96
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,987
When we were standing there..

97
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,454
..there was a big blast in
the parking lot behind.

98
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,459
After that.. - Excuse me, madam..
please.. Out.. out..

99
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,985
I will keep you informed.

100
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,798
Hello. Come in.

101
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,474
DG Bose.
- Morning.

102
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,600
DG Sinha.

103
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,937
The home minister must be arriving
but you may carry on. I will brief him.

104
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,479
Sir, we have been working
on a person..

105
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,486
..for the last eight months..

106
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,148
..of whom we don't have any records.

107
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,488
He controls all those who..

108
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,824
..spread terrorist activities
in our country.

109
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,557
Sir. He enjoys support
from three countries.

110
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,562
Many of the people from our
department work for him.

111
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,973
One of his men has been arrested.

112
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,168
We will get information
about him very soon.

113
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,012
The bomb blast today morning
was his handiwork.

114
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,512
And we have concrete
information that..

115
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,519
..a week from now, for
the 1 0th May, he is..

116
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,521
..hatching such a conspiracy
which will result in a..

117
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,251
..Ioss of twenty odd
thousand people.

118
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,055
How?
- We don't know that, sir.

119
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,054
Who is this man?
- We don't know that too.

120
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,532
His photo, his sketch?
- No, sir.

121
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,536
What do you know about him?

122
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,001
I know his name, sir.

123
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,804
Jambwal.

124
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,545
You can't handle a couple
of blasts in Delhi..

125
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,948
..and trying to teach international
politics to me?

126
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,076
We are answerable to the government.

127
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,213
Sir.

128
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,555
Hello, Siddhant.
- Hello.

129
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:57,562
You wished for a meeting? He is Mr.
Raidu, the lndustries Minister..

130
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,757
..and he is DlG Siddhant.

131
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,633
Yes, I know. I saw your interview
on TV in the morning.

132
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,696
Very good.

133
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,569
Mr. Raidu. Please come.

134
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,575
Sir, I have spoken
to them. They say..

135
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,578
..that the bomb blast which
took place today..

136
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,240
..is the handiwork of some
big terrorist. - Hello.

137
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,574
He is on with the investigations..

138
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,918
..shall I stop him?

139
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,581
I will tell you what
to do after that.

140
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:30,925
It was Swami-ji. There is a press
conference in some time.

141
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,258
They are demanding to
close down the ATC.

142
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:39,204
What are you talking, Mr. Raidu?
- In Hindi. In your language.

143
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,601
If Swami-ji has said so,
we will have to comply.

144
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,006
This is not the way.
Let me speak to him.

145
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,203
I cannot close something
down like this.

146
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:52,282
Swamiji has 40 MPs. Better
think what you want to do.

147
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,610
Want to run the government
or the ATC?

148
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,160
I'll come.
- Okay.

149
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,644
What do you think?

150
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,979
Why do these people want
the ATC to close down?

151
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,653
You are crossing the line.

152
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,180
What was the name you mentioned?

153
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,184
Yes.. Jambwal.

154
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,723
Don't ever mention it again.
Never to anyone.

155
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,166
Who knows who would
turn into your enemy!

156
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,332
There is much more than
what meets the eye.

157
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,678
If you can't close your eyes..

158
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,408
..at least learn to keep your
mouth shut. - Yes, sir.

159
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,875
Got it!

160
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,239
How did they know that our man
is in the opposite building.

161
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,703
If our man is amidst them,
someone from..

162
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,878
..theirs must be in among
us too. You know!

163
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,887
I don't know about 'inside' but there
is someone on the periphery, for sure.

164
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,760
Good morning, sir. Here is a
fax from the home ministry.

165
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,172
Altaf.

166
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:43,252
What do you know about Jambwal?
What is he going to do on the 1 0th?

167
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:51,294
Heard that something catastrophic
will happen this time.

168
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:56,324
Nothing like that will happen,
Altaf. You will tell us everything.

169
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,137
Your wife and children
are in Sultanpur.

170
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,812
In the past tense. It is Jambwal's
principle to destroy the..

171
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,476
..weaknesses of the
ones who are caught.

172
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,983
Our job doesn't let us make friends.

173
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,230
Nor does your job let you do that.

174
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,831
After working honestly
for twenty five years..

175
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:33,998
..we get a fax to close
down this department.

176
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:41,505
One fax. No space for discussions
even. It's an order.

177
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,512
What have I earned in these
twenty five years?

178
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,847
Forget a friend. I don't
even have a person..

179
00:19:53,926 --> 00:20:01,196
..who would ask me what my wish is.
You are in the same situation.

180
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:08,871
You risked your life and now your
people want you to swallow this..

181
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:15,369
..and end your life. What
have you earned, Altaf?

182
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,881
Nothing.

183
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,888
Why don't we become friends?
While I oblige you..

184
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,890
..you reciprocate by obliging me.

185
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,290
We already share a bond
of enmity, don't we?

186
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,392
And I have played my
part to perfection.

187
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,092
One more will do!

188
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,904
Yeah, going on! Yes. I
will keep you posted.

189
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,030
Altaf's file.

190
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,232
Okay. Bye.

191
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,574
Altaf is a goner today! Sir
is in a horrible mood today.

192
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,448
His mood is going to ruin our night.

193
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,319
Keep watching.. the meeting
will last a long time.

194
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,421
I don't know what you see in him.

195
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:09,099
Even I don't understand that.
But he has style.

196
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:17,601
Sir.. that fax.
- Which fax?

197
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,103
They say that the ATC will
be closed down in a week?

198
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,603
Not in a week. In seven days.

199
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,278
And the whole world can turn
upside down in seven days.

200
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,212
The whole world can turn upside
down in seven days, huh!

201
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,353
Hello?

202
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,126
All DCs in the conference
room. Right away.

203
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:47,629
Come on.

204
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,235
Okay, is everyone ready? It's
gonna be a long night.

205
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,971
Shall we order for dinner?
- Chinese.

206
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,982
Shashank.. Chinese..
- Sorry, sir.

207
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,986
Please come.
- This is my place.

208
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,328
Eight months ago, I had appointed
an agent in Bulgaria.

209
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,005
Her name is Neha. I just received
a call from Neha..

210
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:25,009
..and she told me that one
of Jambwal's close aide..

211
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,012
..Himmat Mehendi, who handles
Jambwal's finances..

212
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,516
..has been arrested. He
was drunk and driving.

213
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,283
Now, listen to me carefully.

214
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:42,616
Shashank, and Aditya, both
of you will go there

215
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,029
And as soon as Himmat is released..

216
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,691
.. you will kidnap and take him
to the place recommended by Neha.

217
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,029
And then, make him talk..

218
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,037
..about Jambwal's whereabouts..

219
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:58,372
..and his plans for the 10th.
But there is a problem.

220
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,638
We cannot make this mission
an official one.

221
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,050
If you are caught in this mission,
neither do I know you..

222
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,519
..nor do you know me.

223
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,122
It all depends on what we can
do in the next seven days.

224
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,188
Either this..

225
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,729
Or this.

226
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,196
All the best, boys.

227
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,337
Siddhant, how can Shashank go? His
sister is being engaged tomorrow.

228
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,247
The engagement is in the morning.
the flight is in the night.

229
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,688
I was going to become a pilot.
Don't know how I got stuck here.

230
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,155
It is good. At least you
will die alone here.

231
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,100
Don't know how many innocent people
you would have risked there.

232
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,428
You are funny.
- Yes.

233
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,267
Let's rock, boys.
- Let's rock, sir.

234
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:14,517
I have spoken to them. They
will release you by Monday.

235
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,110
Call up as soon as you are released.

236
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:53,147
Oh.. don't pluck raw buds..

237
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:57,559
Oh.. don't pluck the raw buds..

238
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:02,157
The gardener will get annoyed.

239
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:09,333
The gardener will get annoyed.

240
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,705
Congrats.
- Thanks.

241
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,507
Hi, guys. Did you come right now?
- Thank you.

242
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,246
What happened?

243
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:31,190
Nothing. I always felt there
is a lot of time in his going.

244
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,857
But didn't realize.

245
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,203
Look at this.

246
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,865
Please, don't fight today.

247
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,209
Aditya, good that you are here.
You are aware, aren't you..

248
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,404
..that you have to directly go to
the airport from here. - Yes.

249
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,673
Have you brought the clothes?
- Yes.

250
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,214
Just a minute..

251
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,208
Shashank, I am thinking..

252
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,219
Why do you save him all the time?

253
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,812
Forget it. Let bygones be bygones.

254
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,219
It is Anu's engagement today.

255
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,350
Yes.

256
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,358
You look stunning today.

257
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,765
I always appear stunning to you.

258
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,235
I know.

259
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,241
Anu. You are right.

260
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,304
Don't know whether I am right
or not. But this wretched job.

261
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,839
Returning home at two in the night
and leaving early at six.

262
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,253
And then, who knows? A call
would come one fine day..

263
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,415
..that I will never come back.

264
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,755
Then a medal and a letter
from the ministry.

265
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:43,927
You deserve much better.
Much better.

266
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,271
Hey, no more flirting
with our princess.

267
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,273
Okay, I am guilty. Come here,
man. You lucky guy.

268
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,275
Congratulations.
- Thanks, man.

269
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,608
Greetings.

270
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,283
Greetings.
- Please come.

271
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,285
Hello.
- Please come. - Hi, Shashank.

272
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,845
Who's that girl?

273
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,326
Who's that girl?

274
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,794
I really got to know..
I really need to know..

275
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,331
Who's that girl?

276
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,458
Where's she from?

277
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,866
Who's that girl?

278
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,336
I got to know her.
I got to meet her.

279
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,870
The lips deceive the heart.

280
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:07,509
We beat around the bush.

281
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:12,348
Moments when one can express
the heartfelt..

282
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:16,690
..are very rare.

283
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,423
This isn't something new in love.

284
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,024
The gaze looks for
her all the time.

285
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,366
And the heart is lost.

286
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:30,875
The moment her image
appears to fade..

287
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,376
..there she is, in person!

288
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,379
There she is, in person!

289
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,915
There she is, in person!

290
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,973
Taking over the heart!

291
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,386
There she is, in person!

292
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,649
There she is, in person!

293
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:49,057
The lips deceive the heart.

294
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:53,860
We beat around the bush.

295
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:58,392
Moments when one can express
the heartfelt..

296
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,407
..are very rare.

297
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:07,741
This isn't something new in love.

298
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:12,408
The gaze looks for
her all the time.

299
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,418
And the heart is lost.

300
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,421
The moment her image
appears to fade..

301
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,423
..there she is, in person!

302
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,755
There she is, in person!

303
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,953
There she is, in person!

304
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,428
There she is, in person!

305
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,432
There she is, in person!

306
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,764
Taking over the heart!

307
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,433
Who's that girl?

308
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,768
Who's that girl?

309
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,174
I really got to know..
I really need to know..

310
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,440
Who's that girl?

311
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,107
Where's she from?
- Who's that girl?

312
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,450
I got to know her.
I got to meet her.

313
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:21,812
Each facet of the season..

314
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,982
..has turned into your trait.

315
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:35,496
This experience of love..

316
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,970
..has turned into your devotion.

317
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:44,498
You are in my eyes
and in my dreams.

318
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:49,513
This happens in love!

319
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,915
There she is, in person!

320
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,510
There she is, in person!

321
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,021
Taking over the heart!

322
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:31,021
Your departure will
mean a separation.

323
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:35,549
The heart will be filled with
a feeling of loneliness.

324
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:39,961
My eyes express your feelings.

325
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:44,559
When the heart dearly
misses someone!

326
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,570
There she is..

327
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,588
Who's that girl?

328
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,590
Who's that girl?

329
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:16,066
The lips deceive the heart.

330
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:20,662
We beat around the bush.

331
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:25,607
Moments when one can express
the heartfelt..

332
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:29,943
..are very rare.

333
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,877
This isn't something new in love.

334
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:39,617
The gaze looks for
her all the time.

335
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,625
And the heart is lost.

336
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,093
The moment her image
appears to fade..

337
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,630
..there she is, in person!

338
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,632
There she is, in person!

339
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,032
There she is, in person!

340
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,297
Taking over the heart!

341
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,657
Who's that girl?

342
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,722
Ok.

343
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,161
Hurry up. We are late.

344
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,268
Come on.

345
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,675
Let me have some Pepsi
and I will join you.

346
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,680
You will get a Pepsi inside too.

347
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,673
Try to understand.

348
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,184
We won't get Pepsi inside.

349
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,155
Where did he go?

350
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,282
To have a Pepsi.

351
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,689
Come soon.

352
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:57,292
You never refuse him, isn't it? If
only I too had an elder brother.

353
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,102
Look attentively. Maybe you do have.

354
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:02,831
Thanks, bro.

355
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:09,904
Don't fight. And look after
him. And yourself too.

356
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,710
Actually, he looks after me.

357
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,718
See you. Here he is,
after his Pepsi.

358
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,724
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

359
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,454
Take care.

360
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,140
You smoked?

361
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,734
No.. why will l?

362
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,748
Why this smell?

363
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:48,208
What do I know.. come on..

364
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,478
Bye.

365
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,016
Sir, we will call you as
soon as we reach there.

366
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,757
Don't call from there.
- Okay, we won't.

367
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,765
Come on.
- Yes, I am.

368
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:07,896
Shall we move, sir?

369
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,774
Don't worry, you will
go on the next mission.

370
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:17,042
It's okay, sir. Maybe
I am not capable of..

371
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:22,178
Rather I am not capable. I cannot
stay alone. I need you.

372
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,183
I am always there for you.

373
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,914
See you in the office.

374
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,294
What is it?
- Nothing.

375
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,191
Yes, son.
- Shall I tell you something?

376
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,134
I like it when you address
me as son. - Me too.

377
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,800
I love you, son. I love you.
- Bye.

378
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,411
Shall we?
- I am waiting for you only.

379
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,819
Jay, I am very sure that we are
lost. Which way are we on?

380
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,484
You never listen to me. - We will
reach quickly, this is the short cut.

381
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:06,227
Where? You and your shortcuts.
Listen to me and take a left.

382
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,226
I remember, we have to go right.
We will go right.

383
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,097
No, we have to go left.
- We have to go right.

384
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,830
If we take the left, we
will reach the airport.

385
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,897
No, we will not. Take a left.
- She is right. Take a left.

386
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:18,967
Come on.

387
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:23,907
What did you think?
Friendship or enmity?

388
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:33,852
Friendship. You need my friendship.
Now, we have to see..

389
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,917
..what is the price that you ask.

390
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,262
We are more loyal than
your department.

391
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,400
We will give you money,
and friendship too.

392
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,262
As it is you have earned
a lot of enmity.

393
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:53,042
What do you think? Friendship
or enmity?

394
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,032
Hello?

395
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:30,176
You dare hit Altaf one more and you
would be in trouble. We need Altaf.

396
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,911
You will come to know of
how and where. And yes..

397
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,976
..we have your sister
and brother-in-law.

398
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:39,079
We have arranged for a small party
to celebrate their engagement.

399
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,581
Hello.. hello.

400
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,098
Did you see that, Shashank?
There she is.

401
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,770
She is fair.

402
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,106
The fairer, the better, Shashank.

403
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,046
Stupid.

404
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,052
He will be bashed one day.

405
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,551
Private number.

406
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,063
She was stunning, right?

407
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,123
I didn't see her face..

408
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,537
A car is there is as beautiful
as her. For you.

409
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:12,406
The Hummer, right?
- Right. Behind that.

410
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,610
As soon as you come out of the
parking lot, drive on highway 13..

411
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,082
Twelve kms. I will call later. Bye.

412
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,085
Hello. Neha..

413
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:29,291
Shit.. that car. Highway number
13. She will call me again!

414
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,089
Where? When? I don't know.

415
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,096
Shashank, that fair one was
better. I am telling you.

416
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,158
Shashank.

417
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,171
Hey, Shashank. You can
drive if you want to.

418
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,099
Aditya..
- Yes? - Your bag.

419
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,636
Of course, I was about to get it.

420
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,286
Can't really understand
why people smoke.

421
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,121
Those who don't can
never understand it.

422
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,133
Yes, and the ones who do, don't
survive to tell the tale.

423
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,127
Those who tolerate you everyday..

424
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,673
..can't be harmed by
a mere cigarette.

425
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,266
Can you hear anything?

426
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,144
Yes, your stupidity, so shut up.

427
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,736
There is something behind
this stupidity.

428
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,871
Increase the speed.

429
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,743
Decrease it. Increase.

430
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:38,219
Shashank, we are jacked, this
car has a bomb in it.

431
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,426
Oh, you are funny.
- Not this time.

432
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,161
Seriously.

433
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,829
Don't reduce the speed.
Let me check in the rear.

434
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,833
I was wondering whether
you would come or not.

435
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,174
Even I was indecisive
since morning..

436
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,178
..whether I should come or not.

437
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,304
Thanks for coming.

438
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,846
Okay, you didn't bring your car?

439
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,515
No. I felt if you'd come, l'd
convince you to come with me.

440
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,179
I thought that we would
return together.

441
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,191
I didn't find the bomb here. Bonnet.

442
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:15,688
Your boot.. doesn't it close?

443
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,258
Sometimes. I have to get it checked.

444
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,203
Shashank..

445
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,675
What do I do? You told me
not to reduce the speed.

446
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,705
No..

447
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,348
See, how they are driving.

448
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,221
Stop the car.
- She is telling me.

449
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,227
See, how they are driving. They
will bloody kill someone.

450
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,626
They are crazy.

451
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,290
You aren't alone. You
are with your wife.

452
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,227
There are other policemen
in this city.

453
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,239
Bloody stupid.

454
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,254
Stop the car.

455
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,788
I said, stop the car.

456
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,929
Shashank. The bomb is in front.

457
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,265
Now who is this after us?

458
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,277
Tell him that there is a bomb here.
He will take a U turn.

459
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,613
Make that crazy man understand.

460
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:09,778
Stop the car.

461
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,781
Look.. Iook at the way
they are driving.

462
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,816
You will not change.

463
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,340
The person who didn't change
after killing his child..

464
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,343
..what is he supposed
to change now?

465
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,469
Please, stop it.

466
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:43,471
There is a restaurant ahead.

467
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,344
One cheese burger please!

468
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,419
I didn't kill my Kabir.
I didn't kill my Kabir.

469
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:09,873
Shashank, my braveheart. Even
policemen don't chase like this.

470
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:13,038
Bomb! Shashank, where is
the rear view mirror?

471
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,779
How handsome.

472
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,540
Don't remove your foot
from the accelerator.

473
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:56,485
Hello, darling. So you
are hiding here.

474
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,814
Shashank..

475
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,959
XP 500G.

476
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,427
Don't apply the brakes. Or else,
brother will have..

477
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:10,092
..to attend Anu's
marriage all alone.

478
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,109
Was it diffused?
- No.

479
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,518
Shashank.. private number.

480
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:39,653
Hello.

481
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,790
Your friend drives excellently. But
why does he always remain angry?

482
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,857
Good question. Couldn't
be known till today.

483
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:48,132
But you are going to find
that out pretty soon.

484
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,165
Shashank. Private number.

485
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,506
The first car was fixed. This time
she is going to blow us up.

486
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,518
I already had my eyes closed.

487
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,043
I have been working on this case
for the past eight months.

488
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,045
Now it is all yours.

489
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,706
Just checking if you
can handle it. Test!

490
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:09,677
You have passed.

491
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,614
Neha.

492
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,957
How far is the Downtown police
station from the city?

493
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,066
We have to reach there
before eleven.

494
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,965
No. we will go home first.

495
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:33,907
Yes, we just have to change.
Bathing is already over.

496
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,638
Please, I am feeling cold.

497
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:52,720
Busy?

498
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:07,109
You seem to be quite hassled.

499
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,009
Someone from us is with them.

500
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:17,018
I made this family with
such love. And one of us?

501
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:19,747
Suspect someone?

502
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:22,750
Everyone.

503
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,220
Me too?

504
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,962
Yes, you too.

505
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,631
They have Anu and Jay.

506
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:37,765
What have you decided?

507
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,638
Something.

508
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,171
Tell me if you need me.

509
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,676
Come on. I will tell you the time.
- Where are you taking me?

510
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,838
Why are you taking me in the car?
- We will tell you everything.

511
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,686
Where are you taking me? Where
are you taking this car?

512
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,348
What are you doing? Who are you?

513
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:31,690
Look carefully. You don't
know us. Himmat Mehendi.

514
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:36,028
Himmat Mehendi? Who
is Himmat Mehendi.

515
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:41,864
See, you are mistaken.
My name is JD.

516
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:45,704
Shashank, he says that he is JD.
The same as that of a whiskey?

517
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,111
See, try to understand. My
name is not Himmat Mehendi.

518
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,704
My name is JD. If you
don't believe it..

519
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,046
..come with me to
the police station.

520
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,177
I have been released just five
minutes ago. What is the time now?

521
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,722
The car that you were in
day before yesterday..

522
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,122
..met with an accident.

523
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,263
Himmat Mehendi. You
have two options.

524
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,392
Agree, without resistance or agree,
after being bashed.

525
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,733
Take your hands off my collar.
Take your hands off my collar.

526
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,271
How the hell did you grab my collar?

527
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:18,739
One thing is sure. The person who
followed us in the morning..

528
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,073
..was a policeman.
- How do you know that?

529
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,735
He is still following us.
- Shit.

530
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,742
Let's go out of the city.

531
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,931
Out with your hands behind
your back. Quick.

532
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,782
Who are you guys?
- See, sir. We are.

533
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:13,124
We haven't said anything as yet.

534
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:15,460
Your face says that
you are going to lie.

535
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:16,924
Shall we tell the truth then?

536
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,331
Why are you hitting him?

537
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,267
Tell us what you want to hear.

538
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:26,537
Ok, where were you going with
car number 3310, today morning?

539
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,271
Where were you supposed to reach?

540
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,813
I lost my wife because of you.
- Because of me?

541
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,815
Yes. She was returning
after one year.

542
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,874
Whom is he talking about?

543
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,217
Who is he?
- He is our friend.

544
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,812
I am not their friend.
They have hit me a lot.

545
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,825
And this fair guy, he
had hit me real hard.

546
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,361
What is he saying?
- Listen to me.

547
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:46,827
Shut up!

548
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,831
He is lying, not me. Listen to me.

549
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,493
Just listen to me.
- Quiet.

550
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,830
Gunshot! Hey he is falling over me.

551
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,838
Move.

552
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,844
Come on. Let's go.

553
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,520
Who are these people?

554
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,859
Whoever they are, they are very
angry. - He is a goner.

555
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,862
Let's take him inside.

556
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,265
Are you crazy? If we take him
inside, we will land up inside.

557
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:26,994
He is a policeman.

558
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,872
Then we will do what
policemen should do.

559
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,998
Let's rock.

560
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,074
To the left.

561
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,513
Shoot.

562
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:17,970
What happened?

563
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,040
Point 38 bullet and a man.

564
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,511
Look at me. There is
blood on my shirt.

565
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:26,987
And these people don't
believe that..

566
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:30,049
Agree that you are Himmat Mehendi.
There isn't any way out.

567
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,723
How does she know that my
name is Himmat Mehendi?

568
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,323
Come on inside. I will tell you.
- Is there place to sit there?

569
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:39,467
Why did you bring him here?

570
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:42,528
Had I not done so, he would
have brought in many along.

571
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,540
And I didn't feel like
leaving him there.

572
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,478
You have a heart?

573
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,011
I do.. till now.

574
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,149
Name.

575
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,683
You said what my name is.

576
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,555
Himmat.

577
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,029
Mehendi.

578
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:11,693
Age.

579
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,030
I am forty four years old.

580
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,561
But my parents have recorded two
years less on the passport.

581
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:18,438
They are illiterate, you know.

582
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,373
What are you doing here, Himmat?

583
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:27,777
You brought me here, and now you
are asking me what I am doing?

584
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,580
What are you doing here in Canada?

585
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:35,722
I was called to Canada.

586
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:40,722
Who called you to Canada?
- You know that.

587
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,562
Very funny. For what?

588
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,194
I don't know that.

589
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,076
What is happening on the 1 0th?

590
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,202
What is happening?

591
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,075
There isn't any festival even.

592
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,478
What is Jambwal going to do?

593
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:08,751
No one can ever know about
Jambwal's activities..

594
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,218
What will you tell him?

595
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,091
Everything. - What? - l
will tell him everything.

596
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,757
He is a police man.
- That's why.

597
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,493
He can harm you.

598
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,759
He won't.
- How do you know?

599
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,095
Some faces make you feel..

600
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,504
..you can relate to them.

601
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,769
And do these relationships work?

602
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,108
Sometimes, they do work.

603
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:49,225
Himmat Mehendi.

604
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:52,728
Drink.. here..

605
00:57:56,334 --> 00:57:57,892
What do you do for Jambwal?

606
00:58:11,816 --> 00:58:13,750
I teach the moves.

607
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:17,083
The movements of the pawns.

608
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:23,923
Their international movements.

609
00:58:23,995 --> 00:58:29,023
There are Dollars, Dinars, Pounds!
Black, white and blue money.

610
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:33,093
Green buckes, our money, their
money, I talk about money.

611
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:35,833
I play with money. With
Jambwal's money.

612
00:58:35,907 --> 00:58:37,841
The source of Jambwal's money..

613
00:58:37,909 --> 00:58:44,371
..when it should be seen and when it
should remain hidden, everything.

614
00:58:44,449 --> 00:58:48,442
And nothing is out in the open.
Everything is here.. inside.

615
00:58:51,856 --> 00:58:53,983
No one can peep inside, right?

616
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,192
This is what I do for Jambwal.

617
00:58:59,864 --> 00:59:03,197
So, you are the money
behind that madness.

618
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:08,000
I am mere money, sir. Rather
the world is mad.

619
00:59:09,073 --> 00:59:12,531
A small man comes from
Punjab here, to Canada.

620
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,475
He does small things, small
amount of money laundering.

621
00:59:14,545 --> 00:59:16,137
A little bit of here and there.

622
00:59:16,881 --> 00:59:21,443
One day, he gets a huge amount,
to take from lraq to America.

623
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:27,014
He carries it. He later finds out..

624
00:59:27,091 --> 00:59:30,026
..three hundred sixty people murdered.

625
00:59:33,898 --> 00:59:35,889
That man is scared.

626
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:39,334
He thinks that he will never
work with Jambwal after this.

627
00:59:39,904 --> 00:59:42,998
But Jambwal never listens
to anyone's refusal.

628
00:59:43,908 --> 00:59:49,244
He kidnaps him from home. Then
he does what Jambwal says.

629
00:59:49,347 --> 00:59:53,010
And he will continue doing it till
such time Jambwal asks him to do.

630
00:59:57,188 --> 00:59:58,849
Look..

631
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:04,024
You two lndian soldiers.
And this little lady.

632
01:00:04,929 --> 01:00:09,195
Jambwal will crush you while you
chant your national anthem.

633
01:00:09,934 --> 01:00:14,928
Jambwal is watching everything.
And he never forgives.

634
01:00:15,006 --> 01:00:17,941
It isn't late even now.
There is still time.

635
01:00:18,009 --> 01:00:21,274
It would have been late.
But it won't be late now.

636
01:00:23,281 --> 01:00:27,047
You guys are under arrest.
I have heard everything.

637
01:00:27,952 --> 01:00:30,887
Put it down, inspector. No account..

638
01:00:30,955 --> 01:00:35,289
..for bullets is kept on the
mission that we are on.

639
01:00:36,561 --> 01:00:39,394
Thousands of bullets have
returned unsuccessful..

640
01:00:39,464 --> 01:00:41,398
..in the past 17 years.

641
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:43,957
We don't aim false.

642
01:00:44,402 --> 01:00:48,099
But I shoot the first bullet.

643
01:00:48,172 --> 01:00:49,503
We can talk.

644
01:00:49,574 --> 01:00:55,240
Of course. But after
lowering the guns.

645
01:00:55,413 --> 01:00:58,246
Because even if a single
bullet is shot..

646
01:00:58,316 --> 01:01:03,083
..whoever loses their life,
you will be the ones dead.

647
01:01:03,988 --> 01:01:05,421
Down.

648
01:01:18,002 --> 01:01:20,266
According to our intelligence..

649
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:22,932
..a dangerous criminal, Jambwal,
has planned..

650
01:01:23,007 --> 01:01:25,271
..something lethal and catastrophic
for the 10th of this month.

651
01:01:27,278 --> 01:01:32,341
We are here to investigate it. And
this is the only man who can help us.

652
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:34,611
So, right now, I would need you
to cooperate with me, officer.

653
01:01:34,685 --> 01:01:36,619
And we don't have much time.

654
01:01:40,024 --> 01:01:41,286
Officer.

655
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,122
Okay.

656
01:01:48,466 --> 01:01:50,297
I will help you.

657
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:52,295
And..

658
01:01:53,371 --> 01:01:55,635
Thank you. For saving my life, guys.

659
01:01:55,706 --> 01:02:00,143
But we will not live here.
We will live in my house.

660
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:01,974
And where is his house?

661
01:02:19,063 --> 01:02:22,328
I don't dare to believe
anyone in the office.

662
01:02:24,335 --> 01:02:30,501
I haven't called a colleague today,
but the one whom I love.

663
01:02:32,577 --> 01:02:38,345
Today I am going to do something in
which anything can happen.. to me..

664
01:02:41,085 --> 01:02:45,522
..to our family. If anything
happens to me..

665
01:02:47,091 --> 01:02:48,615
Take care of everyone.

666
01:02:52,096 --> 01:02:53,620
You are the eldest.

667
01:03:12,216 --> 01:03:14,047
What is going to happen on the 10th?

668
01:03:15,653 --> 01:03:17,712
Give me my bottle.

669
01:03:33,404 --> 01:03:35,804
Please, one more.

670
01:03:35,873 --> 01:03:38,137
Give him, please.
- Nonsense.

671
01:03:38,209 --> 01:03:41,269
What is going to happen on the 10th?

672
01:03:44,348 --> 01:03:49,251
Only Jambwal knows the entire plan.

673
01:03:51,155 --> 01:03:54,420
We just know our parts.

674
01:03:58,162 --> 01:04:01,256
The sitar knows which chord to play.

675
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,498
The drum knows its rhythm.

676
01:04:07,171 --> 01:04:09,605
And the strings know of its notes.

677
01:04:11,175 --> 01:04:14,110
And then, there are trumpets
somewhere far away.

678
01:04:22,286 --> 01:04:28,623
And just near Jambwal,
lie a few drums.

679
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:40,301
Then Jambwal raises his hands.
And there is music.

680
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:04,153
Go away from here now.

681
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:09,222
What to tell you?

682
01:05:13,237 --> 01:05:14,568
How does he look?

683
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,240
Don't ask this question.

684
01:05:19,243 --> 01:05:21,905
The one who comes to know
this doesn't survive.

685
01:05:22,246 --> 01:05:23,679
How does he look?

686
01:05:24,782 --> 01:05:29,515
He is tall. He walks like a lion.

687
01:05:33,257 --> 01:05:35,248
He has curly hair.

688
01:05:37,528 --> 01:05:42,363
And his smile is like small
children. Very cute.

689
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:51,274
I don't know about his eyes.
Nobody has seen into them.

690
01:05:52,276 --> 01:05:56,610
They say there is death in them.

691
01:06:01,952 --> 01:06:06,218
His brother was recognized
by the police.

692
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:11,386
Everyone was worried as
to what will happen.

693
01:06:12,963 --> 01:06:18,299
But, only Jambwal had the answer.

694
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:19,295
What else do you know about him?

695
01:07:20,364 --> 01:07:26,496
I have already said what I knew.
Don't try to know more.

696
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,629
Please go and think about your family.

697
01:07:28,706 --> 01:07:33,803
My wife isn't going
to come back. Never.

698
01:07:34,812 --> 01:07:38,714
And as far as my son is concerned,
I have killed him.

699
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:42,912
What will you kill him?

700
01:07:43,387 --> 01:07:47,949
What will you kill my son?

701
01:07:53,664 --> 01:07:55,393
Sir, shall I make the entry?

702
01:07:55,466 --> 01:07:56,660
Okay, sir.

703
01:08:01,939 --> 01:08:06,399
You may hide it from your people. How
will you hide it from my people?

704
01:08:06,477 --> 01:08:09,537
You close my eyes, and
you can't see yourself?

705
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:55,518
Siddhant.

706
01:09:57,855 --> 01:10:00,517
Do you really think
that I am with them?

707
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:02,957
I have sent two younger brothers
in such a danger..

708
01:10:03,027 --> 01:10:05,461
..that I can't even try
to find out about them.

709
01:10:05,963 --> 01:10:09,956
On top, I have to suspect you,
as well. I hate this job.

710
01:10:24,548 --> 01:10:27,142
Everything will be all
right. Don't worry.

711
01:10:35,659 --> 01:10:36,751
Hello?

712
01:10:36,827 --> 01:10:39,557
You removed Altaf from there?
We didn't come to know of it.

713
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:41,825
And what are you doing
in the office till now?

714
01:10:41,899 --> 01:10:45,494
Go to MG road. Someone
waits for you there.

715
01:10:45,836 --> 01:10:52,002
Drive carefully.
- What happened? - Come with me.

716
01:11:37,888 --> 01:11:39,549
No.. no..

717
01:11:57,307 --> 01:11:59,241
He can really tolerate a lot.

718
01:11:59,309 --> 01:12:03,109
I thought he'd die after
being hit so much.

719
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,740
Do you know where he gets
so much strength from?

720
01:12:05,816 --> 01:12:08,080
He is absolutely convinced,
that Jambwal..

721
01:12:08,152 --> 01:12:11,747
..will kill us and have him rescued.
- Right.

722
01:12:11,822 --> 01:12:13,653
He is Jambwal's devotee.

723
01:12:15,659 --> 01:12:17,923
I have an idea. If we
make him believe..

724
01:12:17,995 --> 01:12:20,793
..that Jambwal wants
to kill him, then?

725
01:12:21,665 --> 01:12:24,225
Good idea. He will definitely
crack up.

726
01:12:24,301 --> 01:12:26,997
If he happens to believe,
he will speak.

727
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:29,004
Good, then we will do it tonight.

728
01:12:29,072 --> 01:12:32,098
What did you say yesterday?
- What did I say?

729
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,271
That you killed your son.

730
01:12:37,347 --> 01:12:38,678
Shashank.

731
01:12:40,951 --> 01:12:43,010
I don't want to talk about this here.
- You will have to.

732
01:12:44,955 --> 01:12:47,617
I said, I don't want
to talk about this.

733
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:49,691
You will have to talk about this.

734
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,250
Didn't I tell you that I don't
want to talk about this?

735
01:12:51,328 --> 01:12:52,625
You will have to talk about it. No.

736
01:12:52,696 --> 01:12:54,027
Shashank, it's personal

737
01:12:54,097 --> 01:12:56,292
No.. no.. it's not personal.
- Shashank.

738
01:12:56,366 --> 01:12:57,958
It's not personal at all.

739
01:12:59,703 --> 01:13:02,137
We are working with him.
We are in his house.

740
01:13:02,206 --> 01:13:04,970
He will be showing us the
way. I want to know..

741
01:13:05,042 --> 01:13:06,976
..who we are working with,
in whose house are we..

742
01:13:07,044 --> 01:13:08,978
..and who will be showing us the way?

743
01:13:09,713 --> 01:13:12,273
Such a man who can kill his own son?

744
01:13:12,349 --> 01:13:16,809
So, you understand, it's not
personal. I want an answer.

745
01:13:16,887 --> 01:13:20,152
Why did you kill your son?
- I didn't kill my son.

746
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:27,320
Priya was pregnant. She
was to be admitted..

747
01:13:27,397 --> 01:13:29,991
..the next day for delivery.
I had taken her..

748
01:13:30,067 --> 01:13:32,831
..to our favourite place for lunch.

749
01:13:34,738 --> 01:13:38,674
Wait.. wait.. I am there.
Come.. be careful.

750
01:13:38,742 --> 01:13:40,676
Careful. Ok.. ok.. come.

751
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:47,842
Hello.

752
01:13:48,018 --> 01:13:49,178
Greetings.

753
01:13:51,088 --> 01:13:52,851
Greetings.

754
01:13:58,095 --> 01:14:01,758
No.. no.. it will be a boy, and
I have decided the name too.

755
01:14:03,767 --> 01:14:05,200
Is the table ready?

756
01:14:05,769 --> 01:14:06,895
Come, sit.

757
01:14:07,204 --> 01:14:08,865
You okay?
- Yeah.

758
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:11,769
Do you understand each
other's language?

759
01:14:11,842 --> 01:14:14,367
Not the language but we
do understand each other.

760
01:14:15,779 --> 01:14:19,306
What will you have?
- No..

761
01:14:19,383 --> 01:14:22,375
Give me the money. Give me the money.

762
01:14:23,453 --> 01:14:24,715
Dan..

763
01:14:27,124 --> 01:14:28,216
Dan..

764
01:14:29,059 --> 01:14:30,219
Stop it, Dan.

765
01:14:34,798 --> 01:14:36,789
Dan, he will die.

766
01:14:38,068 --> 01:14:40,901
Dan.. stop it.. he will die.

767
01:14:44,074 --> 01:14:45,234
Leave him alone.

768
01:14:45,409 --> 01:14:48,310
I will kill her. I will kill her.

769
01:14:48,812 --> 01:14:51,076
By God, I will kill her.

770
01:14:51,148 --> 01:14:52,740
Damn it, I say, don't.

771
01:15:12,836 --> 01:15:15,270
After that, Priya couldn't
stay with me.

772
01:15:17,374 --> 01:15:21,174
Whenever she did, she
remembered Kabir.

773
01:15:21,278 --> 01:15:24,111
And she remembered my beastly face.

774
01:15:24,848 --> 01:15:27,282
I have tried to bring
her back many times.

775
01:15:31,855 --> 01:15:34,949
Even today I am doing the same.

776
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:43,328
Shashank. Shashank.. I
had shot that ruffian.

777
01:15:47,471 --> 01:15:54,138
And I lost Kabir. I lost my Kabir.

778
01:16:01,985 --> 01:16:08,220
I didn't kill my son. I didn't
kill my son, Shashank.

779
01:17:02,946 --> 01:17:04,379
Once.

780
01:17:05,949 --> 01:17:07,382
I don't know.

781
01:17:12,389 --> 01:17:15,290
I will ask just once.

782
01:17:15,358 --> 01:17:16,950
I don't know.

783
01:18:43,046 --> 01:18:44,479
This wasn't the deal.

784
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:48,984
This wasn't the deal.

785
01:19:05,068 --> 01:19:09,164
We had taken the oath
to risk our lives.

786
01:19:10,073 --> 01:19:14,635
Why our families? Why
our families, sir?

787
01:19:14,711 --> 01:19:20,513
Do we kill their families? How
did this poor guy hurt them?

788
01:19:23,086 --> 01:19:26,078
Why should he.. die like this..?

789
01:19:30,427 --> 01:19:35,694
We are doing our work, sir.
Why should Anu suffer?

790
01:19:39,436 --> 01:19:43,702
Nothing will happen to Anu.
I have spoken to them.

791
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:47,369
I will return Altaf to them today.

792
01:19:49,112 --> 01:19:52,104
You and Aditi will back me up.
- Yes, sir.

793
01:19:52,182 --> 01:19:55,242
Today, in the evening,
Dholakunwan warehouse.

794
01:19:56,119 --> 01:19:59,054
We will reach half an hour earlier..

795
01:19:59,122 --> 01:20:02,250
..I will pick Aditi
at five thirty sharp.

796
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:08,222
Okay.

797
01:20:34,491 --> 01:20:36,083
Two targets, nine o' clock.

798
01:20:41,164 --> 01:20:42,426
137.(One target, seven.)

799
01:21:30,313 --> 01:21:31,473
Hello.
- Hello. - Yes, tell me.

800
01:21:31,548 --> 01:21:32,640
You are under custody.

801
01:21:32,716 --> 01:21:34,650
Siddhant didn't tell us when
we have to reach here.

802
01:21:34,718 --> 01:21:36,345
He just said 'evening'.

803
01:21:42,492 --> 01:21:43,652
Anu, dive.

804
01:22:00,243 --> 01:22:01,676
Are you all right, child?

805
01:22:06,249 --> 01:22:09,241
Move.
- Speak up, right now.

806
01:22:09,319 --> 01:22:10,843
I will not even count till three.

807
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,356
Asif and lrfan, two of Jambwal's
men betrayed Jambwal.

808
01:22:14,524 --> 01:22:17,789
I had to reach Canada and
kill them before the 1 0th.

809
01:22:18,261 --> 01:22:24,200
Because they were about to foil his
plans. I don't know anything else.

810
01:22:26,269 --> 01:22:27,361
Ajay.

811
01:22:28,271 --> 01:22:31,263
There was 99 at 2 zero hours.
We have a rat in the hole.

812
01:22:31,608 --> 01:22:33,200
Scan database. Revise all passwords.

813
01:22:35,879 --> 01:22:37,540
Seal all out going communication.

814
01:22:41,284 --> 01:22:43,377
Bravo 1 2 to sixteen zero five.

815
01:22:43,453 --> 01:22:44,943
Bravo 1 2 repeat to sixteen zero five.

816
01:22:45,021 --> 01:22:47,546
99, not to be reported.
Do you copy me?

817
01:22:47,624 --> 01:22:49,387
99, not to be reported.

818
01:23:00,637 --> 01:23:02,400
Everyone clear the room, now.

819
01:23:15,919 --> 01:23:17,910
Why did you do this, Roy?

820
01:23:21,658 --> 01:23:30,327
My father retired at 1 2,500. I
would have retired at 22,000.

821
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:40,439
They offered so much money, sir,
that I forgot everything.

822
01:23:42,445 --> 01:23:47,439
Neither this department, nor you..

823
01:23:49,352 --> 01:23:51,286
..and nor..

824
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,692
What do you know about Jambwal?

825
01:24:02,632 --> 01:24:04,691
I don't know anything
more than you do, sir.

826
01:24:06,903 --> 01:24:09,371
What is about to happen on the 10th?

827
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:14,975
I don't know, sir. But I know that
something huge will take place.

828
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:20,313
The code name of this whole
operation is JEET.

829
01:24:20,383 --> 01:24:24,717
And then, you will scan my computer.

830
01:24:39,402 --> 01:24:41,666
How can I believe you?

831
01:24:45,508 --> 01:24:50,741
I cannot lie to you anymore, sir.
I cannot lie to you anymore.

832
01:24:56,686 --> 01:25:00,520
Why did you do this, Roy?
Why did you do this?

833
01:25:01,424 --> 01:25:06,862
What will I go out and say? That you
did all this for money? - No, sir.

834
01:25:08,431 --> 01:25:11,093
The rest of them will
also retire at 22,000.

835
01:25:12,702 --> 01:25:14,761
Who will interrogate you?

836
01:25:14,871 --> 01:25:17,431
Whom will you be able to face, Roy?

837
01:25:23,446 --> 01:25:24,538
Sir.

838
01:25:30,053 --> 01:25:32,453
You have always shown the way.

839
01:25:33,456 --> 01:25:40,055
Please.. give me a punishment,
which should suffice.

840
01:25:42,465 --> 01:25:46,993
I cannot live like this. I
cannot live like this, sir.

841
01:25:48,471 --> 01:25:53,408
Please.. sir.. please..

842
01:26:01,484 --> 01:26:07,480
I know that you like me a lot. Please
don't reduce my punishment.

843
01:26:10,493 --> 01:26:13,929
Sir, I can't live like this. Please.

844
01:27:08,818 --> 01:27:15,018
I can't believe this. I don't
know since when..! And we?

845
01:27:16,559 --> 01:27:18,823
We couldn't conceive that
someone in our office.

846
01:27:21,898 --> 01:27:25,026
He was such a hard working guy.
I don't know what happened.

847
01:27:25,902 --> 01:27:29,998
Anyway, we are scanning his hard disk.

848
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,011
What the hell was that?

849
01:28:38,641 --> 01:28:42,634
Sir.. sir.. someone
is there in my room.

850
01:28:42,712 --> 01:28:44,577
He was shooting at me.
- What? What happened?

851
01:28:44,647 --> 01:28:45,909
He was shooting at me.
- Shooting?

852
01:28:45,982 --> 01:28:48,075
Someone was trying to kill me.

853
01:28:48,151 --> 01:28:50,176
Someone shot at him in his room.

854
01:28:50,253 --> 01:28:52,585
Have a seat. Sit.

855
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:56,752
We will see.
- We will check.

856
01:28:56,826 --> 01:29:00,762
Where are you leaving me here?
I will die if he comes here.

857
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:03,993
Sit down, don't worry. We will check.

858
01:29:05,768 --> 01:29:08,999
Dan, three shots, close range.

859
01:29:09,071 --> 01:29:11,096
Let's check the house.

860
01:29:19,682 --> 01:29:24,016
Lies. All that I thought was a sham.

861
01:29:25,021 --> 01:29:27,956
A man like Jambwal cannot
be anyone's friend.

862
01:29:28,024 --> 01:29:30,288
He had sent someone to kill me.

863
01:29:31,694 --> 01:29:35,630
I was mad to think that
Jambwal needs me.

864
01:29:38,134 --> 01:29:42,628
I have helped him so much.
If I am caught once..

865
01:29:42,705 --> 01:29:45,640
And that too, you guys caught
me.. he will kill me.

866
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:47,039
Nobody can save me.

867
01:29:47,109 --> 01:29:50,237
We will save you. Sit down, please.
- Nobody can save me.

868
01:29:50,713 --> 01:29:53,807
His window was open. He must
have come from there.

869
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,650
Let me go away from here.

870
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:58,653
Nobody will kill you.
- He will kill.

871
01:29:58,721 --> 01:30:01,155
Nobody can kill you. We will
save you. We are with you.

872
01:30:01,224 --> 01:30:02,987
Nobody can save me from Jambwal.

873
01:30:03,059 --> 01:30:04,253
Nobody else will try.

874
01:30:04,327 --> 01:30:08,730
Just tell Jambwal's whereabouts?

875
01:30:09,065 --> 01:30:12,728
And if we kill him, your
life is not at risk.

876
01:30:12,802 --> 01:30:16,738
But what if you cannot kill him?
- We will keep saving you.

877
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:20,732
And if you kill him,
will you release me?

878
01:30:25,748 --> 01:30:29,343
I take an oath on God, I will
never help a terrorist.

879
01:30:29,418 --> 01:30:32,353
I will go back to my village.
I am really stuck here.

880
01:30:33,356 --> 01:30:36,883
Okay, we will let you go,
but after Jambwal is dead.

881
01:30:38,861 --> 01:30:42,194
See, the truth is..

882
01:30:42,765 --> 01:30:48,032
I don't know where Jambwal
is. But last week..

883
01:30:48,771 --> 01:30:54,767
..Asif and lrfan had betrayed him.
They will know, for sure.

884
01:30:54,844 --> 01:30:59,713
I will take you to Asif then.

885
01:31:16,799 --> 01:31:21,327
If you love me!

886
01:31:21,404 --> 01:31:25,932
If you love me, take
me in your embrace!

887
01:31:34,817 --> 01:31:39,151
If you love me, take
me in your embrace!

888
01:31:39,221 --> 01:31:43,749
If you love me, take
me in your embrace!

889
01:31:43,826 --> 01:31:47,762
I am craving for a glimpse of yours.

890
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:52,426
I am craving for a glimpse of yours.

891
01:31:52,501 --> 01:31:56,767
Come, and take your possession.

892
01:31:56,839 --> 01:32:05,770
Give me a chance to behold you.

893
01:32:16,959 --> 01:32:21,794
If you love me, take
me in your embrace!

894
01:32:35,411 --> 01:32:37,140
This consent of yours is killing!

895
01:32:37,213 --> 01:32:39,443
These charms of yours are killing!

896
01:32:39,515 --> 01:32:43,975
This seduction of yours is killing!

897
01:32:44,053 --> 01:32:46,146
The troubles that others'
face because of your!

898
01:32:46,222 --> 01:32:48,417
As if an effort to carve the glass.

899
01:32:48,491 --> 01:32:52,825
This enticement of yours is killing.

900
01:32:52,895 --> 01:32:56,490
Give me a chance to behold you.

901
01:32:56,899 --> 01:33:01,165
Give me a chance to behold you.

902
01:33:01,904 --> 01:33:05,840
All wishes still lie unfulfilled.

903
01:33:08,177 --> 01:33:12,580
The heart still waits to be stolen.

904
01:33:14,917 --> 01:33:19,479
All wishes still lie unfulfilled.

905
01:33:19,555 --> 01:33:23,855
The heart still waits to be stolen.

906
01:33:24,026 --> 01:33:28,258
There isn't any dream in my eyes.

907
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:32,858
No spell is cast over me, as yet.

908
01:33:34,937 --> 01:33:39,374
Let me just cross over
in this boat of love.

909
01:33:39,442 --> 01:33:41,467
Give me a chance to behold you.

910
01:33:41,544 --> 01:33:45,878
Give me a chance to behold you.

911
01:33:50,286 --> 01:33:54,552
If you love me, take
me in your embrace!

912
01:33:54,623 --> 01:33:58,889
I am craving for a glimpse of yours.

913
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:03,557
I am craving for a glimpse of yours.

914
01:34:03,632 --> 01:34:07,227
Come, and take your possession.

915
01:34:07,303 --> 01:34:10,898
Give me a chance to behold you.

916
01:34:40,102 --> 01:34:45,267
Greetings, I am very sorry, Mr. Asif.
That I came with these people here.

917
01:34:45,341 --> 01:34:47,605
But I didn't have any other way out.

918
01:34:48,277 --> 01:34:51,269
You may not know how badly I am
being thrashed by these guys..

919
01:34:51,347 --> 01:34:53,110
..for the last three days.

920
01:34:53,282 --> 01:34:54,943
I am like an accident ridden car..

921
01:34:55,017 --> 01:34:59,477
..whose steering, brakes and horn,
everything is out of order.

922
01:35:00,022 --> 01:35:02,616
They are asking me about
Jambwal's whereabouts.

923
01:35:03,025 --> 01:35:06,620
Tell me, can I tell them
where Jambwal is?

924
01:35:06,695 --> 01:35:09,630
Tell them that I cannot tell
them where Jambwal is.

925
01:35:10,366 --> 01:35:14,962
Then I thought, only Asif
or lrfan have the guts..

926
01:35:15,037 --> 01:35:18,302
..to be enemies with Jambwal.

927
01:35:18,374 --> 01:35:21,036
I don't know where lrfan is,
tell me where he is.

928
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:25,046
Or else, I will have
to search for him.

929
01:35:25,114 --> 01:35:28,311
But I will search him out.
Tell me, where is he?

930
01:35:29,385 --> 01:35:34,152
You know, I have a lot of works,
I have to complete them.

931
01:35:34,223 --> 01:35:38,660
Jambwal doesn't forgive anyone.
He doesn't forgive anyone.

932
01:35:40,329 --> 01:35:42,160
He will not forget even
this time around.

933
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:50,169
Please.. tell him.. for
my sake.. please..

934
01:35:50,606 --> 01:35:52,665
Why don't you tell them?

935
01:35:56,078 --> 01:36:00,174
Tomorrow, at five in the
afternoon. Canmore.

936
01:36:10,192 --> 01:36:14,288
Look, this is known
as Jambwal's magic.

937
01:36:27,443 --> 01:36:31,038
She is a nice girl. Don't let her go.

938
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:35,248
It is very painful.

939
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:42,250
Look at me, I am signing the
divorce papers tomorrow.

940
01:36:45,127 --> 01:36:49,257
Speak to me. Will you remove
all your aggression at work?

941
01:36:51,567 --> 01:36:55,594
You are speaking like brother.
- Think that I am your brother.

942
01:36:58,407 --> 01:37:00,068
Like her?

943
01:37:02,144 --> 01:37:03,577
Do you love her?

944
01:37:06,148 --> 01:37:07,581
I don't know.

945
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:09,083
What?

946
01:37:13,155 --> 01:37:14,588
Go and talk to her.

947
01:37:14,757 --> 01:37:16,418
No.. not me..

948
01:37:16,492 --> 01:37:20,428
Come on.. go. What no?
Go.. come on.. go..

949
01:37:39,615 --> 01:37:41,515
Neha.. that..

950
01:37:47,289 --> 01:37:50,520
..that.. I..

951
01:37:53,629 --> 01:37:54,789
Coffee?

952
01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:59,326
You wanted to say something.

953
01:38:01,737 --> 01:38:02,795
No.

954
01:38:02,871 --> 01:38:04,304
Some other time.

955
01:38:12,214 --> 01:38:14,648
Transfer this.
- Yes, ma'am.

956
01:38:25,494 --> 01:38:27,325
I need you to see something.

957
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:31,825
Roy's hard disk has a secret
partition. Its name is JEET.

958
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:33,492
Just as he had told us.

959
01:38:34,336 --> 01:38:38,170
It contains a lot of e-mails that
were sent to a man named Shally.

960
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:40,231
When Renu traced the server,
we found out..

961
01:38:40,309 --> 01:38:42,243
..that a man named Venkat, accessed..

962
01:38:42,311 --> 01:38:45,337
..these e-mails from a cyber
cafe in Karol Baug.

963
01:38:45,414 --> 01:38:49,510
I have sent Raju behind
him. You were right.

964
01:38:49,585 --> 01:38:53,180
There is much more than
what meets the eye.

965
01:38:53,522 --> 01:38:57,253
Venkat works in the Prime
Minister's office.

966
01:38:58,527 --> 01:39:00,518
Security department.

967
01:39:03,265 --> 01:39:05,256
Prime Minister's office.

968
01:39:40,736 --> 01:39:43,728
The files have been burnt.
Nothing is left.

969
01:40:04,993 --> 01:40:06,858
I will check the computer.

970
01:40:19,608 --> 01:40:22,600
There is a hard disk partition
called JEET in here too.

971
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:26,771
Lots of coded e-mails.

972
01:40:29,618 --> 01:40:31,813
But only one new name.

973
01:40:33,455 --> 01:40:34,786
Bilal Masood.

974
01:40:50,372 --> 01:40:52,704
The PM is in Canada on the 10th.

975
01:40:52,774 --> 01:40:55,470
His life is in danger in Canada.

976
01:40:56,378 --> 01:40:58,369
Why didn't you inform Bose, then?

977
01:40:58,447 --> 01:41:01,314
I was about to, when l
happen to remember Roy.

978
01:41:01,483 --> 01:41:05,715
When I cannot trust anyone
in my office, how can l..?

979
01:41:06,388 --> 01:41:08,652
I will go to Canada tonight.

980
01:41:35,751 --> 01:41:40,017
You didn't have it fixed till now.
You should have done it by now.

981
01:41:40,422 --> 01:41:41,980
Don't know..

982
01:41:49,431 --> 01:41:55,529
Ok. Ok.. quiet. Nothing. Easy..

983
01:41:56,538 --> 01:41:57,698
Who is he?

984
01:41:57,773 --> 01:41:59,536
I don't know.

985
01:42:01,443 --> 01:42:02,535
Ok.. Ok.. Where all did you go?

986
01:42:02,611 --> 01:42:03,873
I don't know.

987
01:42:04,446 --> 01:42:06,539
Went to the school and then to home.

988
01:42:06,615 --> 01:42:09,982
I don't know anything else.
Who is he? Who is he?

989
01:42:10,052 --> 01:42:16,389
Don't worry. Relax. We will
find out. We will find out.

990
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,742
Be careful.

991
01:42:48,490 --> 01:42:50,481
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

992
01:42:50,559 --> 01:42:53,585
I will give you a call as soon
as I find out something, ok?

993
01:42:53,662 --> 01:42:55,027
Take care. Okay.

994
01:42:55,097 --> 01:42:57,429
I owe you one, bro. Thank you so much.

995
01:43:53,819 --> 01:43:55,252
In the name of Allah!

996
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:23,224
Dan!

997
01:47:17,456 --> 01:47:19,287
What happened?

998
01:47:30,636 --> 01:47:33,298
He can't be Jambwal, if he has died.

999
01:47:34,907 --> 01:47:36,499
He is dead, Himmat.

1000
01:47:37,709 --> 01:47:40,303
Himmat, we have finished Jambwal off.

1001
01:47:40,379 --> 01:47:42,313
Be rest assured.

1002
01:47:42,714 --> 01:47:46,707
Now you are free, from us,
as well as from Jambwal.

1003
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:57,324
I didn't even think of being
free from Jambwal's clutches.

1004
01:48:00,732 --> 01:48:03,860
Now, I will stop this illegal
transfer of money.

1005
01:48:04,803 --> 01:48:08,500
I will go to my village
and open a poultry farm.

1006
01:48:10,742 --> 01:48:14,838
Although you have hit me a lot,
you are real nice chaps.

1007
01:48:15,614 --> 01:48:17,514
If you happen to visit Punjab..

1008
01:48:17,616 --> 01:48:20,517
..just reach Londwal and
ask for Mehendi's house.

1009
01:48:20,752 --> 01:48:22,344
They will directly bring
you to my place.

1010
01:48:22,955 --> 01:48:24,354
Welcome.

1011
01:48:24,623 --> 01:48:26,352
Okay.

1012
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:28,756
Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

1013
01:48:29,828 --> 01:48:33,696
Oh! Younger bother. Please..

1014
01:48:34,533 --> 01:48:37,366
Welcome. Thank you.

1015
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:44,370
Aditya.

1016
01:48:47,779 --> 01:48:51,579
Shall we go to Neha's house once?
Maybe, she hasn't gone as yet?

1017
01:49:03,729 --> 01:49:06,926
She had written that she will
go. Maybe.. - Come on.

1018
01:49:44,937 --> 01:49:46,427
Sir.

1019
01:49:46,939 --> 01:49:48,429
Brother.

1020
01:49:54,046 --> 01:49:57,038
Brother, he is Dan from Canadian
police. He has helped us a lot.

1021
01:49:57,115 --> 01:49:59,515
Danish.
- Siddhant.

1022
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:03,451
What brings you here, sir?

1023
01:50:03,622 --> 01:50:05,453
I came to meet Neha. And you?

1024
01:50:06,625 --> 01:50:08,456
Even we came to meet Neha.

1025
01:50:08,627 --> 01:50:10,458
It's too late. She's dead.

1026
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:13,459
What?

1027
01:50:26,945 --> 01:50:28,469
She is not Neha.

1028
01:50:29,481 --> 01:50:33,884
Who had hired Neha? You
are me? She is Neha.

1029
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:38,882
The dead body which was
found in Priya's car.

1030
01:50:38,957 --> 01:50:40,481
His name was Himmat Mehendi.

1031
01:50:44,997 --> 01:50:46,965
The person who was moving
around with you..

1032
01:50:47,032 --> 01:50:48,761
..was Jambwal.

1033
01:50:49,668 --> 01:50:50,828
'My name is JD.'

1034
01:50:51,903 --> 01:50:57,842
'Nobody knows a thing about
Jambwal's activities.'

1035
01:50:59,011 --> 01:51:00,979
'Jambwal sees everything.'

1036
01:51:03,849 --> 01:51:05,510
'Jambwal doesn't forgive anyone.'

1037
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:08,848
'He can't be Jambwal, if he has died.'

1038
01:51:10,922 --> 01:51:14,517
He had two hurdles for
his plan for the 10th.

1039
01:51:14,793 --> 01:51:19,662
Asif and lrfan. And he gave a contract
to Altaf in Delhi to kill both of them.

1040
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:22,528
And that evening, Altaf was arrested.

1041
01:51:22,868 --> 01:51:26,702
'Asif and lrfan, two of Jambwal's
men had betrayed him.'

1042
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:29,699
'l had to reach Canada and
kill them before the 1 0th.'

1043
01:51:29,941 --> 01:51:33,069
'Because they would foil
his plan on the 10th.'

1044
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:35,545
And that night, in Canada,
Himmat Mehendi..

1045
01:51:35,614 --> 01:51:38,708
..and Jambwal met with
an car accident.

1046
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:46,080
Our agent Neha, who followed them,
didn't know Jambwal.

1047
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:50,720
She just knew Himmat Mehendi, and
she gave me this information.

1048
01:51:52,164 --> 01:51:56,100
Aditya and Shashank, you came
here to arrest Himmat.

1049
01:52:00,072 --> 01:52:01,733
And Jambwal was arrested.

1050
01:52:04,976 --> 01:52:09,174
And Jambwal had you do what
he wanted Altaf to do.

1051
01:52:11,083 --> 01:52:12,573
We killed lrfan.

1052
01:52:18,056 --> 01:52:22,755
But Asif.. suicide.. no..

1053
01:52:24,863 --> 01:52:26,797
No, Asif was killed by Jambwal
in our presence.

1054
01:52:27,666 --> 01:52:29,600
No, Jambwal killed Asif. So
what if he didn't shoot him?

1055
01:52:30,936 --> 01:52:35,600
At that moment, Himmat wasn't with
Asif. It was Jambwal himself.

1056
01:52:35,674 --> 01:52:36,936
'Why don't you speak?'

1057
01:52:38,143 --> 01:52:39,610
He didn't have any other way out.

1058
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,871
He knew that you two
would be arriving.

1059
01:52:45,016 --> 01:52:50,215
Therefore, Neha was killed and
someone else took her place.

1060
01:52:55,127 --> 01:53:00,121
Jambwal played with four senior
officers of two countries.

1061
01:53:03,034 --> 01:53:10,634
He is really big. And no one
knows of his plan as yet.

1062
01:53:23,188 --> 01:53:25,656
Sir, the information which this
phone numbers will provide..

1063
01:53:25,724 --> 01:53:27,658
..in the next half an hour is
beyond your comprehension.

1064
01:53:29,728 --> 01:53:30,990
Mr. Raidu..

1065
01:53:32,164 --> 01:53:35,190
Yes, sir. The first three
numbers belong..

1066
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:37,667
..to the lndustries Minister
Suryakant Raidu.

1067
01:53:39,137 --> 01:53:40,832
And what if this doesn't hold true?

1068
01:53:42,174 --> 01:53:45,940
I am ready to go to the gallows.
- Okay.

1069
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:50,843
I will tap these phones. All the best.

1070
01:53:51,183 --> 01:53:54,346
Thank you. And sir, don't
forget to watch the TV.

1071
01:53:54,753 --> 01:53:57,278
TV? Okay.

1072
01:54:02,027 --> 01:54:04,018
Joseph, bring Altaf downstairs.

1073
01:54:04,095 --> 01:54:07,360
And listen. Don't make
an entry in the register.

1074
01:54:20,245 --> 01:54:21,712
Come out.

1075
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:33,920
Go, Altaf. You are free. I am going
to the TV station from here.

1076
01:54:35,193 --> 01:54:38,993
Exactly after five minutes I would
state this in a live telecast..

1077
01:54:39,064 --> 01:54:41,726
..that you have disclosed
the names of five people to me.

1078
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,734
I am going to lie.

1079
01:54:44,002 --> 01:54:46,732
Then those people for whom you work..

1080
01:54:46,805 --> 01:54:49,899
..will search for you wherever you
are in this world, and kill you.

1081
01:54:51,142 --> 01:54:55,010
My lies will be caught.
But only you will die.

1082
01:54:57,082 --> 01:54:59,277
Go. You are free now.

1083
01:55:40,125 --> 01:55:44,789
Or there is another way out.
You will testify on TV.

1084
01:55:45,297 --> 01:55:47,788
And then, I promise to save your life.

1085
01:55:49,301 --> 01:55:51,792
Think it fast, Altaf.
I don't have much time.

1086
01:55:52,137 --> 01:55:57,803
Altaf has named some political
and administrative bigwigs.

1087
01:55:57,876 --> 01:55:59,810
Let's talk to Aditi Kumar.

1088
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:04,878
Altaf will answer this question.

1089
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:11,814
Hello. What is this
interview on the TV?

1090
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:14,820
Hello. Hello, how are you, sir?
- Whose name was mentioned?

1091
01:56:14,893 --> 01:56:18,226
Hello.. yes.. I have seen it..
- Whose name was mentioned?

1092
01:56:21,166 --> 01:56:24,033
I will come to your office.
- Oh, listen.. did he take my name?

1093
01:56:24,169 --> 01:56:26,831
Try to understand. Our phones
are being tapped.

1094
01:56:27,005 --> 01:56:29,371
Did they mention my name?
- Don't speak, please.

1095
01:56:29,441 --> 01:56:31,102
Your name?
- Please disconnect the line.

1096
01:56:31,176 --> 01:56:33,041
Whose name..
- Why don't you understand, sir?

1097
01:56:33,178 --> 01:56:35,339
We will die.
- Shut up!

1098
01:56:37,015 --> 01:56:38,846
What is this?

1099
01:57:02,874 --> 01:57:05,866
But sir.. how can you
be sure that JEET..

1100
01:57:05,944 --> 01:57:08,208
..is such an important
word in Jambwal's plan.

1101
01:57:11,282 --> 01:57:16,049
Before Roy died, he said this
word held some hidden meaning.

1102
01:57:22,060 --> 01:57:23,220
Did you smoke?

1103
01:57:24,229 --> 01:57:26,288
No!
- Yes, sir. And what else did Roy say?

1104
01:57:28,233 --> 01:57:31,896
Nothing else. But there
was one more name.

1105
01:57:33,238 --> 01:57:34,899
Bilal Masood.

1106
01:57:37,308 --> 01:57:38,900
Who is this Bilal Masood?

1107
01:57:40,245 --> 01:57:42,509
I don't know. Watch this.

1108
01:57:46,918 --> 01:57:48,909
There are twenty six alphabets
in English language.

1109
01:57:49,187 --> 01:57:52,918
A is the first, B is the second
and C is the third.

1110
01:57:53,324 --> 01:57:55,918
This way 'J' is the tenth.

1111
01:58:02,267 --> 01:58:03,928
J is the tenth.

1112
01:58:07,405 --> 01:58:11,341
E is the fifth.

1113
01:58:11,409 --> 01:58:12,933
That means, 10th May.

1114
01:58:16,214 --> 01:58:20,947
E is the fifth. That means,
at 5 o'clock.

1115
01:58:21,953 --> 01:58:28,950
And T is the twentieth.
- But what's twenty?

1116
01:58:30,228 --> 01:58:33,959
That is what we have to find out.
Give me a second, guys.

1117
01:58:34,032 --> 01:58:35,966
I want to show you something.

1118
01:58:46,444 --> 01:58:49,242
Tenth May, 5 o'clock,
at Mac Mahon stadium.

1119
01:58:50,515 --> 01:58:51,982
What is this?

1120
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:53,378
It's a foot ball stadium.

1121
01:58:54,486 --> 01:58:55,976
But yes, tomorrow, at
5 o'clock, some..

1122
01:58:56,054 --> 01:58:57,988
..twenty to twenty five
thousand people..

1123
01:58:58,056 --> 01:59:01,150
..are felicitating the lndian
Prime Minister there.

1124
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:03,388
Twenty five thousand.

1125
01:59:03,461 --> 01:59:04,985
According to our first information..

1126
01:59:05,063 --> 01:59:07,998
..twenty five thousand
people will be dying.

1127
01:59:09,601 --> 01:59:12,161
We may perhaps come to know
the meaning of 20 there?

1128
01:59:13,171 --> 01:59:14,399
But where is Mac Mahon stadium?

1129
02:00:32,417 --> 02:00:37,081
Welcome to Mac Mahon stadium. It's
a pleasant evening and we have..

1130
02:00:37,155 --> 02:00:41,091
..a wonderful crowd of 25000 people
here to enjoy the game.

1131
02:00:41,259 --> 02:00:43,557
Welcome to Mac Mahon stadium.

1132
02:00:43,628 --> 02:00:47,086
To celebrate the anniversary of the
trade ties between Canada and lndia..

1133
02:00:47,165 --> 02:00:48,689
..this evening has been
arranged, which..

1134
02:00:48,766 --> 02:00:50,700
..will have a match, and
some cultural programmes.

1135
02:00:51,269 --> 02:00:54,102
The lndian prime minister will
be arriving in some time.

1136
02:00:54,372 --> 02:00:59,275
Roger and I are with you to bring
this exciting evening to you.

1137
02:00:59,844 --> 02:01:01,106
Dan, where are you?

1138
02:01:01,279 --> 02:01:03,577
I am backstage. The foot ball
match will start in a while.

1139
02:01:03,648 --> 02:01:05,309
There is a cultural show before that.

1140
02:01:05,383 --> 02:01:06,645
I will keep you informed.

1141
02:01:06,718 --> 02:01:09,186
Okay, I will be in the VlP area.
- Okay.

1142
02:01:11,289 --> 02:01:12,449
What are you doing here?

1143
02:01:12,523 --> 02:01:14,320
My children are performing.
I am getting late.

1144
02:01:14,392 --> 02:01:16,121
I will see you later, okay?

1145
02:01:18,596 --> 02:01:21,121
And this is the moment we all
were waiting for, friends.

1146
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:23,133
On the special invitation of
the Canadian government..

1147
02:01:23,201 --> 02:01:25,135
..the lndian Prime Minister
Mr. Manmohan Singh..

1148
02:01:25,203 --> 02:01:27,296
..has arrived to watch this match.

1149
02:01:27,605 --> 02:01:30,130
The Canadian diplomats
are welcoming him.

1150
02:01:30,608 --> 02:01:33,133
It's a very touchy moment for all
the lndians living in Canada..

1151
02:01:33,211 --> 02:01:36,146
..that the lndian Prime Minister
has come to watch this match..

1152
02:01:36,214 --> 02:01:39,149
..and has indeed graced the
occasion with his presence.

1153
02:02:18,256 --> 02:02:20,315
Sir, a remote control
has been found beneath..

1154
02:02:20,391 --> 02:02:23,656
..Neha's seat
which indicates a bomb.

1155
02:02:25,663 --> 02:02:27,187
How much time?
- Sir, twenty minutes.

1156
02:02:30,268 --> 02:02:33,669
We don't know the size of the bomb.
We should evacuate the stadium.

1157
02:02:33,738 --> 02:02:35,205
Impossible. It is impossible
to evacuate..

1158
02:02:35,273 --> 02:02:37,798
..people in just 20 minutes.

1159
02:02:37,875 --> 02:02:41,868
The only way is to find the damn bomb
and diffuse it, now. - Copy that, sir.

1160
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:44,680
Dan, where are you, Dan?
- Yes, Siddhant?

1161
02:02:45,283 --> 02:02:46,545
Who is the security in-charge here?

1162
02:02:46,718 --> 02:02:48,413
Security? Look for Adler

1163
02:02:48,619 --> 02:02:51,281
Adler?
- Yes, Aditya. - Yeah.

1164
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:56,551
You check there. It must
be in the car park.

1165
02:02:56,627 --> 02:02:58,219
I am already in the parking lot, Dan.

1166
02:02:58,396 --> 02:03:00,694
It has to be there as the security
is heavy here since the last night.

1167
02:03:00,765 --> 02:03:03,359
Check there. Search there.
You will get it there, ok?

1168
02:03:03,434 --> 02:03:04,560
I'll keep your posted.

1169
02:03:05,570 --> 02:03:07,231
Who's Adler?
- Yes, check over there.

1170
02:03:10,842 --> 02:03:12,503
Who's Adler?
- I am Adler.

1171
02:03:12,643 --> 02:03:14,508
Listen, there is a bomb
in the stadium.

1172
02:03:14,645 --> 02:03:16,408
We need back up, okay?
- Yes.

1173
02:03:16,781 --> 02:03:18,578
Come there, I will tell
you all about it.

1174
02:03:23,521 --> 02:03:25,580
Siddhant, can't trace the bomb.

1175
02:03:28,426 --> 02:03:31,657
One second. Car number twenty.

1176
02:03:51,816 --> 02:03:56,276
Sir.. sir.. four people are
investigating the bomb in the stadium.

1177
02:03:56,821 --> 02:03:59,756
One of them had reached Adler.
He has been captured.

1178
02:04:00,558 --> 02:04:03,459
We have alerted all our
men in the stadium.

1179
02:04:03,694 --> 02:04:07,960
But sir, we should change the
bomb location immediately.

1180
02:04:27,318 --> 02:04:28,649
We have been fooled once more.

1181
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:29,777
Why? What happened?

1182
02:04:30,488 --> 02:04:32,319
It isn't a bomb. It is a bomb factory.

1183
02:04:34,659 --> 02:04:36,320
You won't let it blast, right?

1184
02:04:36,394 --> 02:04:37,520
How big is it?

1185
02:04:37,595 --> 02:04:39,859
Dan, it's a C 48 X H4 insulated bomb.

1186
02:04:39,931 --> 02:04:41,330
Will it be diffused?

1187
02:04:41,399 --> 02:04:45,335
Dan, this is C4. One block can blow
up a fifteen storey building.

1188
02:04:45,503 --> 02:04:47,334
We have ten.

1189
02:04:47,505 --> 02:04:51,339
Will it be diffused? - The whole
stadium, Dan. The whole stadium.

1190
02:04:53,811 --> 02:04:55,335
How much time?

1191
02:04:56,948 --> 02:05:00,748
Seventeen minutes. And even I can't
do anything in this much time.

1192
02:05:03,688 --> 02:05:05,519
Dan, we will have to take this
car away to somewhere safe.

1193
02:05:06,757 --> 02:05:09,885
It is twenty minutes from
here. We will try.

1194
02:05:09,961 --> 02:05:13,362
Come out of the parking lot with the
car, ok? I will meet you there.

1195
02:05:13,431 --> 02:05:14,762
Let's rock.

1196
02:05:23,774 --> 02:05:25,901
Dan, where are you, Dan?
Where are you?

1197
02:05:26,444 --> 02:05:29,436
I am coming out of the parking lot.
Where are you, Dan? Come in.

1198
02:05:39,557 --> 02:05:41,388
Sit down now.

1199
02:05:41,559 --> 02:05:43,390
Behave like a good boy.

1200
02:05:58,576 --> 02:06:00,407
Dan, come in.. Dan. I have
just fifteen minutes on me.

1201
02:06:00,478 --> 02:06:02,412
Shashank, any news of Dan?

1202
02:06:03,581 --> 02:06:05,811
Don't know! No response from
sir even. I am coming.

1203
02:06:12,957 --> 02:06:16,415
Where is the car? Where
is the damn car?

1204
02:06:16,494 --> 02:06:19,759
Dan.. Dan..

1205
02:06:20,031 --> 02:06:22,431
They have all my children.

1206
02:06:22,934 --> 02:06:27,598
They will kill them. Please
Dan, save my children.

1207
02:06:27,905 --> 02:06:30,635
Dan, I have come out of the stadium.
Where are you, Dan?

1208
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:31,970
Come in!

1209
02:06:49,627 --> 02:06:50,992
The jeep is missing.

1210
02:06:51,062 --> 02:06:53,462
Shit, I will check it.

1211
02:07:20,024 --> 02:07:21,491
What the hell was that?

1212
02:07:25,896 --> 02:07:28,023
Come in, Dan. Come in.
I don't have much time.

1213
02:07:28,099 --> 02:07:29,498
Which way do I go?

1214
02:07:31,836 --> 02:07:34,703
Where are you taking me?
What have I done?

1215
02:07:35,673 --> 02:07:36,833
You tell me, what have you done?

1216
02:07:36,907 --> 02:07:40,968
What do you mean? - See.. I work
here.. what are you doing to me?

1217
02:07:42,980 --> 02:07:46,848
I will hit you. And tell
me when you are tired.

1218
02:07:53,924 --> 02:07:56,654
Siddhant sir.. come in..
where are you?

1219
02:09:05,763 --> 02:09:08,596
Hey, Shahshank, where are you stuck?
No response even from Dan.

1220
02:09:08,766 --> 02:09:10,927
Aditya, we have got Bilal Masood.

1221
02:09:11,001 --> 02:09:13,196
It seems, you will have to search
for the valley yourself. Over.

1222
02:09:15,005 --> 02:09:16,597
Tell me.
- I am telling you.

1223
02:09:16,774 --> 02:09:19,265
Tell us where the jeep is, or
else I will blow your head off.

1224
02:09:25,616 --> 02:09:27,811
Aditya.
- Come in, Dan.

1225
02:09:27,885 --> 02:09:29,011
Come back with the car.

1226
02:09:29,086 --> 02:09:32,078
Dan, I have just ten minutes,
and I don't know the way.

1227
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:37,625
Come back with the car,
or else they will start killing..

1228
02:09:37,695 --> 02:09:39,629
..the children one by one.

1229
02:09:39,797 --> 02:09:40,957
Shit!

1230
02:10:09,727 --> 02:10:10,989
Run!

1231
02:10:12,196 --> 02:10:13,663
Jesus!

1232
02:10:30,014 --> 02:10:38,217
Every child is someone's Kabir.
I want those children back.

1233
02:10:39,156 --> 02:10:41,215
Please, Dan.. please..

1234
02:10:46,297 --> 02:10:52,702
I didn't know it contained so much.
I was just paid to change the car.

1235
02:10:58,776 --> 02:10:59,902
Shashank.

1236
02:11:00,878 --> 02:11:02,709
Any news of Siddhant?

1237
02:11:03,047 --> 02:11:04,912
No, but there is another problem.
- What?

1238
02:11:05,115 --> 02:11:06,707
There is another bomb. Same size.

1239
02:11:06,884 --> 02:11:09,717
How much time?
- Eight minutes.

1240
02:11:09,787 --> 02:11:12,051
It is impossible to go out of the
residential area driving the vehicle.

1241
02:11:12,122 --> 02:11:13,783
There is a flying club
across the road.

1242
02:11:17,127 --> 02:11:18,719
See what can be done.
- Copy that.

1243
02:11:26,003 --> 02:11:28,733
Sir, the first car hasn't
returned to the stadium.

1244
02:11:28,906 --> 02:11:31,739
Everything has been known
about the secret.

1245
02:11:32,810 --> 02:11:36,337
Most of our men are dead or injured.

1246
02:12:15,786 --> 02:12:17,117
What's your position, Dan?

1247
02:12:23,327 --> 02:12:24,794
Position?

1248
02:12:36,974 --> 02:12:38,134
Position safe now.

1249
02:13:18,916 --> 02:13:22,249
I don't think both our cars can
reach the stadium on time.

1250
02:13:25,189 --> 02:13:26,918
Mission failed, sir.

1251
02:13:28,258 --> 02:13:31,022
I repeat, mission failed.

1252
02:13:57,054 --> 02:13:58,885
Where is he?
- I don't know.

1253
02:14:01,225 --> 02:14:02,886
Where is he?

1254
02:14:14,505 --> 02:14:17,906
Siddhant Dheer. Anti Terrorist
Cell, Delhi.

1255
02:14:18,075 --> 02:14:22,444
Relax, officer. Himanshu Verma,
Canadian Police, special agent.

1256
02:14:24,081 --> 02:14:25,241
The reason of your arrival?

1257
02:14:26,183 --> 02:14:29,914
I am in the look out of a terrorist,
sir. - Jambwal? - Yes sir.

1258
02:14:32,256 --> 02:14:33,917
We both are a bit late
in reaching here.

1259
02:14:34,091 --> 02:14:36,184
I have already checked the
north and the south wing.

1260
02:14:36,260 --> 02:14:39,195
But he is still on this floor. Go
to East, I will take the West.

1261
02:14:39,263 --> 02:14:40,992
Okay, sir.
- Here you are.

1262
02:14:41,065 --> 02:14:42,930
Nice meeting you, sir.
- Nice meeting you.

1263
02:15:03,153 --> 02:15:08,557
The death that you brought for
thousands is being carried away by me.

1264
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:14,961
Shashank.

1265
02:15:20,571 --> 02:15:26,134
Whether you want to know or not..
but even I am in love with you.

1266
02:15:27,711 --> 02:15:31,147
Although couldn't live with you,
but I can lay my life for you.

1267
02:15:59,409 --> 02:16:02,537
Are you from Delhi, sir?
- No, why?

1268
02:16:02,613 --> 02:16:06,014
No, sir. Because I studied
in Xavier's college.

1269
02:16:06,083 --> 02:16:09,018
Our teachers said that
there was someone senior..

1270
02:16:09,086 --> 02:16:11,350
..to us by the name Himanshu Verma..

1271
02:16:12,189 --> 02:16:14,020
..who came and joined the
Canadian Police Force.

1272
02:16:14,191 --> 02:16:16,022
So, you are from St. Xavier's?

1273
02:16:16,093 --> 02:16:17,219
Yes, sir.

1274
02:16:18,295 --> 02:16:21,025
I studied there for two years.
Actually, I am from Allahabad.

1275
02:16:21,198 --> 02:16:26,192
What a coincidence, sir. I became
a policeman because of you.

1276
02:16:26,370 --> 02:16:28,235
Bring the car behind, immediately.

1277
02:16:32,209 --> 02:16:35,042
Do you remember Kathuria sir?
- Kathuria sir?

1278
02:16:35,112 --> 02:16:38,047
Yes, sir. The one who
used to forget names..

1279
02:16:40,384 --> 02:16:46,118
Yes.. that.. yes.. I remember
his face.. but not the name.

1280
02:16:47,457 --> 02:16:50,051
The next time you meet him,
tell him that I remember him.

1281
02:16:50,394 --> 02:16:52,055
Sure, sir.

1282
02:16:56,333 --> 02:16:58,062
Yes.. yes.. tell him..
that the next time..

1283
02:16:58,135 --> 02:17:00,069
..I come to lndia
I will definitely meet him.

1284
02:17:00,137 --> 02:17:04,073
Come along, sir. The story
was false. Caught!

1285
02:17:11,481 --> 02:17:13,278
Aditya, come in.
- Yeah, Shashank.

1286
02:17:13,350 --> 02:17:15,079
I am sitting in the cockpit
after eight years.

1287
02:17:15,152 --> 02:17:16,346
Don't know whether I would
be able to fly it or not.

1288
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:18,547
Don't be silly, Shashank.
You will manage.

1289
02:17:36,607 --> 02:17:39,098
All that I can see is
population till far.

1290
02:17:39,376 --> 02:17:42,243
I can't go out in so little time.
Can't seem to find a way.

1291
02:17:42,312 --> 02:17:43,506
You will manage, Shashank, come on.

1292
02:17:46,183 --> 02:17:48,378
There is only one lake
three miles from here.

1293
02:17:48,518 --> 02:17:50,179
But there are buildings
and houses around it.

1294
02:17:50,587 --> 02:17:52,646
The lake is so small, that
we cannot drop the bomb.

1295
02:17:52,723 --> 02:17:54,190
We will have to crash the plane.

1296
02:17:54,291 --> 02:17:57,124
Are you crazy? Drop the bomb anywhere.

1297
02:17:57,194 --> 02:17:58,456
It cannot be more important
than your life.

1298
02:17:58,528 --> 02:18:00,723
Look, north east.. north
east.. scan more.

1299
02:18:00,797 --> 02:18:03,527
Dan, I have just taken off. I
won't be able to reach there.

1300
02:18:05,302 --> 02:18:06,530
There is no other way out.

1301
02:18:06,603 --> 02:18:09,197
Are you crazy, Shashank?
Drop the bomb.

1302
02:18:09,273 --> 02:18:11,207
Aditya is right, Shashank,
drop the bomb.

1303
02:18:11,308 --> 02:18:13,139
If we throw the bomb anywhere,
the death toll..

1304
02:18:13,210 --> 02:18:15,201
..will be more than that in
the stadium. - Throw it..

1305
02:18:15,312 --> 02:18:19,305
Will you jump from the car if you
don't reach the valley? - No.

1306
02:18:21,551 --> 02:18:26,318
You are a nice guy. I wasn't irritated
because you didn't marry Anu.

1307
02:18:28,558 --> 02:18:31,322
I was irritated because
Anu couldn't get..

1308
02:18:31,395 --> 02:18:33,329
..someone better than you.
- Sorry, pal.

1309
02:18:34,498 --> 02:18:38,332
I was such a fool. Do
policemen not marry?

1310
02:18:38,502 --> 02:18:39,833
Take care of Anu. She
is a lovely girl.

1311
02:18:39,903 --> 02:18:44,169
Hey, Shashank, we both will take care
of Anu. Don't talk like crazy?

1312
02:18:44,241 --> 02:18:45,640
Shashank, don't be crazy.

1313
02:18:45,709 --> 02:18:51,648
Shashank, find another location.
There must be some jungle.

1314
02:18:51,715 --> 02:18:54,582
There must be some desert. It's
a bloody order, Shashank.

1315
02:18:55,652 --> 02:18:58,519
There is nothing. Just this lake,
I need your permission.

1316
02:18:58,588 --> 02:19:02,649
Shashank, don't be crazy.
- Don't permit him.

1317
02:19:02,726 --> 02:19:04,193
Aditya, don't be stupid.

1318
02:19:04,528 --> 02:19:06,189
Sir, I need your permission.

1319
02:19:06,263 --> 02:19:10,393
Sir, you always say 'yes' to him.
You will have to refuse him today.

1320
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:12,261
There is no other way out.

1321
02:19:12,369 --> 02:19:15,463
Throw the bomb anywhere.
What nonsense is this?

1322
02:19:15,605 --> 02:19:17,869
Don't be stupid. Do you
know what you are saying?

1323
02:19:18,208 --> 02:19:21,200
Thousands of people will die.
- Shashank, drop the bomb.

1324
02:19:21,278 --> 02:19:23,212
Brother, you will not permit him.

1325
02:19:23,380 --> 02:19:25,473
Don't be stupid. Will you agree?

1326
02:19:25,549 --> 02:19:27,278
What about me?

1327
02:19:27,384 --> 02:19:29,215
Nobody waits for me at home.

1328
02:19:29,386 --> 02:19:32,378
Neither mom nor dad. I got all the
love I needed from you people.

1329
02:19:33,390 --> 02:19:35,221
Don't worry about me.

1330
02:19:35,292 --> 02:19:37,385
Sir, I don't have much time.
I need your permission now.

1331
02:19:37,494 --> 02:19:39,223
I need the go ahead now.

1332
02:19:42,566 --> 02:19:46,229
Is there any other alternative,
Shashank?

1333
02:19:46,303 --> 02:19:49,238
Siddhant, don't give him the
permission. He is your brother.

1334
02:19:49,306 --> 02:19:50,773
No, sir. There is no other way out.

1335
02:19:50,841 --> 02:19:54,743
Throw the bomb anywhere. Eject
from that plane now.

1336
02:19:55,512 --> 02:20:01,417
Please. Sir.. I need
your permission now.

1337
02:20:03,587 --> 02:20:04,781
You can't do that.

1338
02:20:04,855 --> 02:20:06,413
There is no other way out.
I have very little time.

1339
02:20:09,426 --> 02:20:13,453
You can't leave me alone.
Drop the bomb.

1340
02:20:14,431 --> 02:20:15,591
Let people die, Shashank.

1341
02:20:15,665 --> 02:20:18,463
I will be left alone, sir.
You can't do that.

1342
02:20:18,668 --> 02:20:20,260
You can't do that.

1343
02:20:20,670 --> 02:20:23,434
Sir, please.
- Brother..

1344
02:20:26,676 --> 02:20:29,270
You will have to say 'no' today,
you will have to.

1345
02:20:29,346 --> 02:20:30,472
Don't, Siddhant.

1346
02:20:31,615 --> 02:20:33,606
Siddhant, don't, please.

1347
02:20:34,451 --> 02:20:36,282
Brother, please.

1348
02:20:38,755 --> 02:20:41,280
Go, son.
- Don't permit him.

1349
02:20:41,458 --> 02:20:42,618
You can't do that.

1350
02:20:46,696 --> 02:20:48,823
Brother, shall I tell you something?

1351
02:20:50,767 --> 02:20:52,632
I like it when you address
me as 'son'.

1352
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:08,909
And yes.. I lied to you.
I do smoke sometimes.

1353
02:21:24,868 --> 02:21:26,597
Will you do something for me?

1354
02:21:29,005 --> 02:21:33,499
Will you call me as your
son in the next birth?

1355
02:21:36,513 --> 02:21:38,344
Love you, brother.

1356
02:21:41,518 --> 02:21:43,349
I love you, son.

1357
02:21:45,689 --> 02:21:46,883
Over and out.

1358
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:48,822
Shashank.. Shashank..

1359
02:22:08,778 --> 02:22:10,370
Shashank.

1360
02:22:12,549 --> 02:22:14,380
Shashank.

1361
02:23:37,867 --> 02:23:40,631
Those were the most difficult
seven days of my life.

1362
02:23:41,738 --> 02:23:48,871
Everything gradually regained
normalcy. Only my brother.. my son..

1363
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:51,470
I don't know where I had lost him.
