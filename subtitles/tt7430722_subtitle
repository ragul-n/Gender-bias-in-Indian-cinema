1
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,930
Father, some rice?

2
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,260
It was delicious. I've had a lot.
Ask him.

3
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,050
Thanks, I'm done.

4
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,340
Why aren't the kids in bed?

5
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,840
See you tomorrow at 7am.
We'll walk together.

6
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,030
Yes, father.

7
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,880
- Be on time.
- Yes.

8
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,530
Cobra One to Eagle One.
Are you set?

9
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,450
Affirmative, Cobra One.

10
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,470
According to the information,
he's in the front seat.

11
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,110
He's due any time.

12
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,610
Not yet.

13
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,930
But I can smell him.

14
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,240
Farid Haqqani.

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,150
The Jihad salesman.

16
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,110
His speeches have lured many
innocent young men...

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,770
...to leave behind their countries
and join the Jihad.

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,990
They become obsessed
with the idea of martyrdom.

19
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,150
His description of heaven
would lure even a man like me.

20
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,280
That's why we must silence him.

21
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,740
Before he lures others,
send him to heaven.

22
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,580
We have visual, Cobra One.

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,450
Farid Haqqani. That's him.

24
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,900
Eagle One. Take the shot.

25
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,150
Roger, Cobra One.

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,820
Shoot him before he rolls up
the bulletproof window.

27
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,990
His window doesn't bother me...

28
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,150
...or this gun.

29
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,150
None of it bothers me.
He doesn't either.

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,280
Shoot. Dammit!

31
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,530
He had a gun on Farid Haqqani.

32
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,950
Yes, ma'am.

33
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,990
Tell me if I'm right, Colonel.

34
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,570
A shot was indeed fired,
not in Syria at Haqqani...

35
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,990
...but here in New Delhi at our
senior analyst V.K. Naidu.

36
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,150
What the hell's going on,
Colonel Luthra?

37
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,490
Kabir's gone rogue, ma'am.

38
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,220
He's joined hands with the enemy.

39
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,630
Who?

40
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,060
Haqqani? Jaesh?
Rizwan Ilyasi?

41
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,420
Who was the target in Syria?

42
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,680
We all saw the visual feed.

43
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,490
Who pointed the gun?

44
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,740
Kabir rigged the gun and camera
remotely three days earlier.

45
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,320
We had eyes on Haqqani...

46
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,450
...while he shot Naidu,
at the same time.

47
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,570
How the hell do you expect me
to report this to the PMO...

48
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,570
...without sounding like a fool?

49
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,200
Ma'am, you know as much as I do.

50
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,570
Kill him.

51
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,280
We must find him before he makes
another move.

52
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,230
You always said Kabir is our best.

53
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,820
There must be someone
who can outsmart him.

54
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,490
Here's your money, Oslav.
Where's my consignment?

55
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,030
Get him!

56
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,740
Colonel.

57
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,590
I've sorted Oslav and his gang.

58
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,710
They won't be supplying
narcotics to India anymore.

59
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,950
Actually, they're stopping
all drug trade.

60
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,570
Right, sir. I'm on my way.

61
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,990
Hi.

62
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,400
Here's a list of safe houses.

63
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,770
Kabir has seven passports.

64
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,650
But he didn't use any of them
to re-enter India.

65
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,110
We're checking all the flights
from Turkey to Delhi.

66
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,610
What guarantee he came
on an Indian passport?

67
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,110
Or flew from Turkey?

68
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,450
Agreed. But I know he's back in Delhi.

69
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,070
So where is he?

70
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,160
You forgot the key question, Colonel.

71
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,070
"Why?"

72
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,400
A man who trained us all
and who killed many traitors...

73
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,030
...why would he become a traitor?

74
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Let's find out.

75
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,650
Saini, find him!

76
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,740
Report only to me.

77
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,990
Yes, sir.

78
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,630
Is there a problem?

79
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,430
Yes, Colonel, why Saini?

80
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,840
No one knows Kabir better than I do.

81
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,300
Khalid, he'll see you coming.

82
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,950
Of course, we're coming.

83
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,430
He knows that.

84
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
Sir, I know how he thinks.

85
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,840
I know his every move.
I understand him.

86
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,050
- You love him, Khalid.
- Not more than my country.

87
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,180
If you find him...

88
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,630
...could you shoot him?

89
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,380
Yes, sir.

90
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,720
When his motives...

91
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,690
Just as I feared, Khalid.

92
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,760
What if you never discover his motives?

93
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,680
You have my word. Colonel.

94
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,220
I'll wound him first,
then I'll do the asking.

95
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,180
Tell me you're joking, Colonel.

96
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,090
Here's his 2-year report.

97
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,590
He's up there with the other officers.

98
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,260
So?

99
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,090
Kabir, this is your unit.

100
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,220
Decide the men you want in it...

101
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,470
...and how to train them.

102
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,930
Our discussion over, sir?

103
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,180
I want you to have the final decision.

104
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,220
So I must accept your decision.

105
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,010
Kabir...

106
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,590
Khalid has shown he's the best
in any given situation.

107
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,090
So why don't you want him
on your mission?

108
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,300
There isn't one reason...
there are two reasons.

109
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,590
Khalid's traitor father,
Major Abdul Rahmani, shot me.

110
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,800
I survived.

111
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,930
My buddy and partner...

112
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,590
...who stood between Rahmani and me...

113
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,510
...didn't survive.

114
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,760
So I put a bullet through
your father's left eye.

115
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,090
Just to be safe...

116
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,300
...in his right eye too.

117
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,110
So with due respect, Colonel...

118
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,440
...why do you think I'd let
a traitor's son...

119
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,510
...come near me with a gun in his hand?

120
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,050
Permission to speak, sir?

121
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,050
Go on, Khalid.

122
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,130
My father was a traitor.

123
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,470
But how do you think we found out?

124
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,840
My mother suspected it.

125
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,470
She informed the army.

126
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,870
That's why you have a scar
on your body...

127
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,090
...not a shroud covering it.

128
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,880
My father's name is linked to mine.

129
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,930
But I'm my mother's son too.

130
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,300
She sacrificed her husband's life
for her country.

131
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,660
She did not regret it for a second.

132
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,130
Leave us, Lieutenant.

133
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,630
Yes, sir.

134
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,380
His father was a traitor.

135
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,080
Yet, the boy has done so well.

136
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,750
Can you imagine how hard
he has worked?

137
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,800
He has real guts.

138
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,380
He's hell-bent on wiping out the stain
on his family's name.

139
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,090
He knows you shot his father
Major Rahmani.

140
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,180
Yet he enlisted.

141
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,930
He wants you to train him...

142
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,970
...to prove he is not like his father.

143
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,470
People take the test of fire
only once, Kabir.

144
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,430
This soldier is willing to undergo
that test every single day.

145
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,630
Now it's your call.

146
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,380
You're in.

147
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,430
But you're hanging by a thin thread.

148
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,800
One mistake and...

149
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,050
All the best.

150
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,090
You're in hell now.

151
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,260
Jammu, 2009.

152
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,470
Kolkata, 2013.

153
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,260
Surat, 2015. And Hyderabad, 2017.

154
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,220
One man is behind all these attacks.

155
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,380
Rizwan Ilyasi.

156
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,720
India's enemy number one.

157
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,760
Our country is his main target.

158
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,760
But in the eyes of the world,
he's just a businessman.

159
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,380
We tried hard to convince
the international community...

160
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,130
...that he's a global terrorist.

161
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:32,840
But he's clever.

162
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,130
He knows how to cover his tracks.

163
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,760
In the AI 215 blast last year,
193 Indians...

164
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,010
...and 53 foreign nationals
were killed.

165
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,970
One man claimed responsibility;

166
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,260
Basheer Hassib.

167
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,220
A militant rebel commander in Iraq.

168
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,760
How is he connected to Rizwan Ilyasi?

169
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,380
They didn't have AK47s till now...

170
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,430
...so who gave them
anti-aircraft missiles?

171
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,470
He did.

172
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,750
Rizwan Ilyasi.

173
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,510
This is our mission.

174
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,480
Rizwan Ilyasi.

175
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,930
For five years I've done nothing
but track him.

176
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,340
Now I'll pull out all the stops,
I may kill...

177
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,720
...or be killed.

178
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,800
Which is why...

179
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,550
...on this mission, if anyone
screws up in any way...

180
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,550
...I'll take it as a personal attack.

181
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,510
Is that clear?

182
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,510
Yes, sir!

183
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,090
If we get Basheer and prove
his link to Ilyasi...

184
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,740
...no government will shelter him.

185
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,930
We'll lure that rat from its sewer.

186
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,590
Sync watches to 08:09.

187
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,720
Now.

188
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,680
Our mission is simple.

189
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,230
We'll enter an ISIS controlled area...

190
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,940
...and get Basheer Hassib...

191
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,920
...alive!

192
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,360
May peace be upon you all.

193
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,780
This woman has committed a crime
against Islam...

194
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,990
...by committing adultery.

195
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,450
Therefore we must establish
the authority of the Almighty...

196
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,950
...against this sinner
and stone her to death.

197
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,240
Stone her! Stone her!

198
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,520
Stone her! Stone her!

199
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,690
Stone her! Stone her!

200
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,990
God be praised.

201
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,780
You have an album of me!

202
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,780
You're an Indian agent...

203
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,450
...here on a mission. No doubt
to kill me.

204
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,910
Not you...

205
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,030
...I want your boss Ilyasi.

206
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,110
Give him to me?

207
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,660
You want Ilyasi?

208
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,080
You don't even know where you are.

209
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,820
- Three minutes to go...
- I see. And?

210
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,110
Your men will save you?

211
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,240
How do you think they’re ever find you?

212
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,610
You mean this? We found
this transmitter in your shoe.

213
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,280
You came here in one piece, Indian.

214
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,530
This was already in pieces.

215
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,570
Now I will smash you to pieces.

216
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,160
Found two transmitters?

217
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,860
Two?

218
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,450
One tooth is for showing,
the other tooth is for biting.

219
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,910
You dog, will you hit me...

220
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,990
...or will you run?

221
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,030
If missions had scorecards...

222
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,070
...you'd be man of the match!

223
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,110
Kabir will cut you some slack now.

224
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,030
It's not slack I want.

225
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,640
I want his trust.

226
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,240
And I want the star Katrina Kaif!

227
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,070
Sir, someone to see you.

228
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,280
Mother?

229
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,860
Mother?

230
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,410
- Salaam.
- Son.

231
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,240
What brings you here?

232
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,200
I brought you some sacred offerings
from the shrine.

233
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,570
Share them with your colleagues.

234
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,570
I prayed for their good health.

235
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,360
What did you ask for me?

236
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,110
Courage.

237
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,030
And for yourself?

238
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,030
Respect.

239
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,490
You give me courage, Ammi.

240
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,650
Inshallah, I'll never let your eyes
lower in shame again.

241
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,690
I've lived with eyes lowered
for 14 years, Khalid.

242
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,150
You give me the right to look up again.

243
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,270
May God grant you success.

244
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,310
Ammi...

245
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,190
...ask for courage and respect...

246
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,310
...and some cash.

247
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,600
We have bills to pay!

248
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,060
Khalid...

249
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,230
...in my office when you're done.

250
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,650
Yes, sir.

251
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,150
Sir.

252
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,020
Sit.

253
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,970
Sit.

254
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,290
You hid something from me, Khalid.

255
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,690
You missed your targets yesterday.

256
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,020
You didn't see them in time.

257
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,010
They were on your right.

258
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,350
You have a blind spot
in your right peripheral vision.

259
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,940
Don't you?

260
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,900
This deficiency disqualifies you.
I can't enlist you, Khalid.

261
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,190
I can't afford having you in my team.

262
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,190
But, sir...

263
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,990
This team is my family, Khalid.

264
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,150
Their safety is my responsibility.

265
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,690
Your handicap could cost me their lives.

266
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,810
You have to leave, Khalid.

267
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,350
Now.

268
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,900
So you'll let my father win again?

269
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,730
Excuse me?

270
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,650
Even this gift is thanks to him.

271
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,100
Traitor!

272
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,480
Son of a traitor!

273
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,350
Traitor!

274
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,690
Son of a traitor!

275
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,400
Traitor!

276
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,060
My eye was partially damaged.

277
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,810
But my courage was completely broken.

278
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,020
My mother refused to let me
be defeated.

279
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,400
She said each insult...

280
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,900
...each blow...

281
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,400
...each wound will be a reminder...

282
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,100
...of father's treason.

283
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,730
She said no one would trust me.
They'd be suspicious of me.

284
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,100
And if they questioned me,
I would have to justify myself.

285
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,350
Keep answering their questions...

286
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,230
...till no one dared
to question me again.

287
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,440
Give me a chance, sir.

288
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,940
I promise you...

289
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,850
...my eyesight may be weak...

290
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,020
...but not my aim.

291
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,480
I knew you were putting on a show
to clear your family name.

292
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,560
I've always known
you were a traitor's son.

293
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,940
Treason runs in your veins.

294
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,350
Even if a man can move a mountain,
he can't escape his upbringing.

295
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,020
I knew your game from the very start.

296
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,980
But I was waiting for you
to make a wrong move...

297
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,060
...so I could show your true colours
to the Colonel.

298
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,230
You've proved me wrong, Khalid.

299
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,150
You proved the blood in your veins
is not your father's...

300
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,440
...but your mother's.

301
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,600
I was wrong.

302
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,230
And I haven't been so proud
of being wrong till now.

303
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,770
Just promise me something...

304
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,350
...you'll make sure your partner
stands on your right!

305
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,060
Promise.

306
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,690
Welcome to the team, Captain Khalid.

307
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,560
Thank you, sir.

308
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,100
Dismiss.

309
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,100
Tell everyone at home
we'll be late tonight

310
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,270
So don't wait up

311
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,650
We've earned the right to celebrate

312
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,690
So forgive all my mistakes

313
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,230
Friends, for a handful of hours today

314
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,980
Let's walk the wayward path

315
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,650
Let's turn our backs on the world

316
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,520
Let's break all the rules

317
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,350
Out in the open

318
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,520
Making a sound

319
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,600
Drenched in red dye

320
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,650
Like true heroes, we'll dance

321
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,270
Jai Jai Shivshankar!

322
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,230
Carefree and wild

323
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,740
Let the colours fly!

324
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,590
Let the colours fly!

325
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,810
We're raring to go

326
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,560
Carefree and wild

327
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,990
Let the colours fly!

328
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,940
Let the colours fly!

329
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,070
Jai Jai Shivshankar!

330
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,890
Carefree and wild

331
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,530
Let the colours fly!

332
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,550
Let the colours fly!

333
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,730
On a sweet melody

334
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,850
We keep in step

335
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,920
Let's move to the Desi beat

336
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,190
Forget all your inhibitions

337
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,060
Remember to get tipsy

338
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,950
Forget all your shame

339
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,310
Remember to dance

340
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,190
No one will be spared today

341
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,600
Everyone will dance the night away

342
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,520
That's two rounds for us

343
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,440
Let bank notes fly!

344
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,480
Let's get drunk and be merry

345
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,350
Like heroes, we'll dance

346
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,980
Jai Jai Shivshankar!

347
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,730
Carefree and wild

348
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,350
Let the colours fly!

349
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,290
Let the colours fly!

350
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,480
We're raring to go

351
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,190
Carefree and wild

352
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,710
Let the colours fly!

353
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,860
Let the colours fly!

354
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,210
Jai Jai Shivshankar!

355
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,710
Carefree and wild

356
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,310
Let the colours fly!

357
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,820
Let the colours fly!

358
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,670
Jai Jai Shivshankar!

359
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,390
Carefree and wild

360
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,660
Jai Jai Shivshankar!

361
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,340
Carefree and wild

362
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,980
Let the colours fly!

363
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,610
Let the colours fly!

364
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,050
Our plan has worked.

365
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,650
Arresting Basheer has flushed
the rat from its sewer.

366
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,400
Rizwan is in Marrakesh.

367
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,480
But only for a day.

368
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,400
If he leaves who knows when
we'd get another chance.

369
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:07,730
Flight?

370
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,980
The plane's on the runway.
Your gear's on board.

371
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,270
Sir, anyone informed about the mission?

372
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,520
Not yet.

373
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,810
I'm calling the Defence Minister.

374
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,150
No, sir.

375
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,560
Ilyasi always manages to escape.

376
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,560
Someone must be tipping him off.

377
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,810
I'd like to maintain radio silence
on this one, sir.

378
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,350
I want all your phones.

379
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,650
Now.

380
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,810
No calls and no contacts. Got it?

381
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,190
Yes, sir!

382
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,100
Let's go get him, sir!

383
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,400
All the best.

384
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,990
The Abuddin General is at my 10 o'clock.

385
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,680
Sir, I see a black car approaching.

386
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,460
His security.

387
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,570
He'll be here at any moment.
Be ready.

388
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,610
All set, sir.

389
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,030
Everyone's in position.

390
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,110
He'll go inside the restaurant...

391
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,690
...but we'll drag him out.

392
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:52,990
Alive.

393
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,960
Target acquired, sir. It's Ilyasi.

394
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,780
Aditi, keep my count.

395
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,490
10...

396
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:21,990
9.

397
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:24,320
8.

398
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,250
7.

399
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,400
6.

400
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:33,320
5.

401
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,570
4.

402
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:41,780
3.

403
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:45,740
2.

404
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:48,900
1.

405
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,920
Don't move.

406
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:55,990
Hello, Ilyasi.

407
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:58,940
Stand up!

408
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,360
Your next dinner is in India.

409
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,530
I'm not hungry.
But thanks for the invite.

410
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,110
You'll be hungry and thirsty
soon enough.

411
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,110
Now walk!

412
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,400
When will you guys finally get it?

413
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,840
You Indian agents have been trying
to catch me for years.

414
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,690
You'll try forever, Major Kabir.

415
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,820
It's game over, Ilyasi.

416
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,650
Game over.

417
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:33,740
Really?

418
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,530
Ask your team.

419
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,940
All your team members may not agree.

420
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,400
Watch out on your right, sir!

421
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,320
Khalid, let him go!

422
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,490
Khalid, we need Ilyasi.

423
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,280
Back me up, Khalid.
We need Ilyasi.

424
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:47,780
Khalid!

425
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,610
What do experts say?

426
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,610
The local search team has covered
a 50km radius, sir.

427
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,990
They're asking to stop
the surveillance.

428
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,400
Doctor!

429
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,300
Doctor!

430
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,940
Easy, Kabir.

431
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,610
Ilyasi?

432
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,780
Ilyasi?

433
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,780
We lost him.

434
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,990
No, no, no!

435
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,490
Check the checkpoints.

436
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,530
It happened a week ago.

437
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,490
Khalid ran after Saurabh.

438
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,900
He chased him for 20 minutes.

439
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,740
The transmitters were in range...

440
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,900
...then we lost signal.

441
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,030
We combed every inch of the area.

442
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,490
No sign of Khalid or Saurabh.

443
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:30,780
- I think the sea swallowed them.
- I trust Khalid's survival skills.

444
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:37,840
Until we find Khalid's body,
we'll keep looking.

445
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,610
Call an ambulance.

446
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,440
I killed that traitor Saurabh.

447
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,030
You got him?

448
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,190
Ilyasi?

449
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,190
Next time.

450
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,570
Next time.

451
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:30,330
Next time.

452
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,610
I'm proud of you, Khalid.

453
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:06,400
Khalid.

454
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,400
Who's the team-leader?

455
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:13,150
Who do you think?

456
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,860
I think the Colonel has wasted time
putting Saini in-charge.

457
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:26,240
You tracing the call?

458
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,320
Come on, Khalid.

459
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,490
You know it's going to bounce...

460
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,490
...from Istanbul to Hong Kong,
to Nairobi.

461
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,570
- Wanna go on a world tour?
- Sir...

462
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,740
- Still "sir"?
- I was wondering that too.

463
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,570
How did I get you wrong, sir?

464
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,940
No, Khalid.

465
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:51,740
You're not wrong at all.

466
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,610
I shot Naidu.

467
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,240
He was the first on my list.

468
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,820
And the last.

469
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,940
Before you get to someone else...

470
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,570
...I'll get to you.

471
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,490
Then remember what I taught you,
Khalid.

472
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:13,520
Shoot if you get the chance.

473
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,290
Don't hesitate.

474
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,610
I wouldn't.

475
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,280
You taught me another thing, sir.

476
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,990
"Your country comes first...

477
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,940
...second...

478
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,030
...and last."

479
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,030
Should I remember that too?

480
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,490
You won't have the time to forget.

481
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,280
I'll spell it out.

482
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,280
If you come between me
and my target...

483
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,490
...it's game over.

484
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,360
What's the plan?

485
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,490
There's no point now, Khalid.

486
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,690
Tell you what...

487
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,110
...keep our flag ready.

488
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,360
We'll wrap his body in it.

489
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:04,860
Sir?

490
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,240
Find this.

491
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,840
What do you want? Let go!

492
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:21,780
Let go!

493
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,820
Can you fly?

494
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:29,900
- No.
- So why ask me to let go?

495
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,650
Did they work together? Were they
at the Academy?

496
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,150
No, sir. They had no clue
about each other.

497
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,570
No connection between Naidu and Shroff.

498
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,360
There was one.

499
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,940
Kabir shot them both. Who's next?

500
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,610
You? Me? The PM?

501
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:07,940
I'm on it, sir.

502
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:11,770
- If only someone could find him...
- If? Dammit, Khalid!

503
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,280
In this age of cameras, satellites,
biometrics...

504
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:16,860
...can't he be found?

505
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:20,610
And for God's sake,
why is he doing all this?

506
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:24,150
Must more bullets fly before
we find the answer?

507
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,110
What's his motive?

508
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,650
I'm trying to find that out, sir.

509
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:55,360
Warning. Pickpockets operating
in the area.

510
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,990
Salaam, Khalid.

511
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,150
Too late.

512
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:06,690
These innocent bystanders...

513
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:10,070
You should've shot me on sight.

514
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:12,860
Your conscience will stop you now.

515
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,990
Why, sir? Why are you doing this?

516
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,030
You were like a God to me.

517
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,690
We are strange, Khalid.

518
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,780
For us even an idol is God.

519
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:34,030
And if an idol breaks, we ask
how could God break?

520
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,280
You are not an idol, sir.

521
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,690
You're human.

522
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,530
You didn't break...

523
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:45,990
...you just fell off your pedestal.

524
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:50,110
Redeem yourself.

525
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,440
Some advice for you too, Khalid.

526
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,030
Stop chasing me.

527
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,490
I don't want your mother to see you
six feet under.

528
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:03,570
So, please...

529
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:06,530
Get out of my way.

530
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,940
You know that's impossible, sir.

531
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,150
I can't forget my country
to save my skin.

532
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,650
You taught me everything I know...

533
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,190
...except for treason.

534
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:20,900
One thing is true...

535
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,280
...whether my mother sees me
buried or not...

536
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:27,440
...I promise you...

537
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,650
...no one will mourn your death.

538
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,240
If you're so sure of yourself...

539
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:42,940
...then I'll give you a choice.

540
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,860
I can tell you my motive...

541
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:50,860
Or...

542
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:52,400
I don't want to know.

543
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:55,240
Or I'll tell you my next target.

544
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,190
Dammit, sir.

545
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,440
Not "sir" any more, Khalid.

546
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:04,070
Not "sir" any more.

547
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,150
Who or why, Khalid?

548
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:08,900
Who? Or why?

549
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,690
Next station, Karol Bagh.

550
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,440
You want the reason?
Or save a life?

551
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,650
Who? Or why?

552
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,110
Doors open to the left.

553
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,280
Quick! The next stop's mine.

554
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:24,570
Who?

555
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,670
Lion! Lion!

556
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,530
And it's a goal!

557
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:50,960
Lion House 1, Panther House nil.

558
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,560
And it's a goal!

559
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,230
Come on.

560
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,760
Lions have taken the match!

561
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,580
Congratulations Lions!

562
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,520
Well done, Ruhi! Really well done.

563
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,730
What "Well done?" Kabir, we lost!

564
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:16,690
So?

565
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:20,480
What's the point of playing?

566
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,730
The point?

567
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:25,440
Seriously!

568
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,730
Is that what they teach you at school?

569
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:30,890
Winning is everything?

570
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,390
But I don't like losing, Kabir.

571
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,270
I fully agree.

572
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:40,230
When you play a match,
you should play to win.

573
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:45,350
Run fast, play hard,
challenge your opponent.

574
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,690
But when the match is over...

575
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,940
...don't think: "Did I win or lose?"

576
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:00,230
Ask yourself instead: "Did I give it
my very best?"

577
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:05,100
And if your answer is "yes,"
then you're a winner.

578
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:08,270
What would happen if everyone
thought like that?

579
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,140
There'd be fewer sad people.

580
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,230
Remember, Ruhi...

581
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:20,850
...no one can be number one forever.

582
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:24,770
One day or another, you'll be defeated.

583
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:26,980
That's OK.

584
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:29,770
Has anyone defeated you?

585
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:34,190
Mama?

586
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:41,270
Yes. Naina.

587
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:56,690
In the sun and sand,
the sea in the night

588
01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:00,720
And I'm feeling all right,
feeling all right

589
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:21,100
Why waste time?

590
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:24,980
Let's not hold ourselves back

591
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,440
Sleep will not be ours tonight

592
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:33,220
Though our dreams will be fulfilled

593
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,960
We have no need of lifetime vows

594
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:40,690
Let them be unfulfilled

595
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:45,520
Just for this once

596
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:48,720
Hold me close tonight

597
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,810
Hear me just for tonight

598
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:56,820
You danced and danced

599
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:59,920
Till your dancing bells came undone

600
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:04,130
Till your dancing bells came undone

601
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:08,970
Throwing inhibitions to the wind

602
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,020
I danced my heart away

603
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,220
Till my dancing bells came undone

604
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,250
Till my dancing bells came undone

605
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:44,520
Love rules just for a day

606
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:49,820
Tomorrow love may not be mine

607
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,990
Though our hearts beat together now

608
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:01,300
They may not be one forever

609
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:08,030
Let us lose ourselves
in this moment

610
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:16,370
Our love may not last for eternity

611
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:21,560
What point are lifelong vows?

612
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:25,940
Let them be unfulfilled

613
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,230
Just for this once

614
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,520
Hold me close tonight

615
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:37,390
Take me by the hand tonight

616
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:41,600
I danced my heart away

617
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,810
Till my dancing bells came undone

618
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,320
Till my dancing bells came undone

619
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:57,700
Till my dancing bells came undone

620
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,270
Till my dancing bells came undone

621
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,520
Naina, you have to see this!

622
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:21,140
Let me guess. Firoze Contractor?

623
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,850
Last time he sent earrings,
now it's the whole set.

624
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,230
If I keep refusing his gifts,
he'll give me the showroom next.

625
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:31,640
He hasn't missed a single show.

626
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:35,440
Every night, centre table.
He's only asking for one dinner date.

627
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:36,790
Go on. Say yes!

628
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:41,560
If the necklace was the starter,
the main course is not for me.

629
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:43,520
Thank him and return his gift.

630
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,770
You're in a hurry these days.
Have you met someone?

631
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:53,350
Naina.

632
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:55,480
You scoundrel! You didn't tell me.

633
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:57,020
Who is it? Someone special?

634
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:59,890
"Someone special." Unlikely.

635
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,690
But he's nice.

636
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:04,190
You're looking happy after ages.

637
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:06,310
Does he know about Ruhi?

638
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:08,230
No.

639
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,770
He's not that close to me.

640
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,640
Taking it step by step.

641
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:40,140
Give it back!

642
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:08,730
Sir.

643
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,520
- What news, Kabir?
- Nothing at all, sir.

644
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:14,140
Maybe our Intel is wrong.

645
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:15,310
Stay focused, Kabir.

646
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,600
Firoze Contractor is no diamond
merchant based in Antwerp.

647
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:22,140
Our Intel is right. He's laundering
Rizwan Ilyasi's money.

648
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,310
No one wants to catch him
more than I do.

649
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,140
Sir, don't worry.

650
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:28,890
I won't let you down, sir.

651
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,350
And I will never stop.

652
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,730
I lost my team in Marrakesh
because of Ilyasi.

653
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,440
Pratik, Muthu.

654
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,270
Ilyasi has gone underground since.
No trace of him.

655
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,390
This is our first lead to Rizwan
in three months.

656
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:50,730
Better keep an eye on Contractor
till his friend shows up.

657
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:52,270
Sure, sir.

658
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,140
If he greets a passer-by even,
Aditi will do a background check.

659
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:56,270
His conversations?

660
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,390
Constantly recording, sir.

661
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,690
Before he arrived, his villa was bugged.
Cameras and mics.

662
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:02,730
Someone to see you.

663
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:04,600
One second, sir.

664
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:10,600
His accountant is here.
Seems a little urgent.

665
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,690
- I'll get back to you, sir.
- OK.

666
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:22,940
Transfer the 6.5 million
from the last deal...

667
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:25,480
...to these four anonymous
bank accounts.

668
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,100
All right, sir.

669
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:32,230
Sir, may I say something?

670
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:35,850
These four accounts belong
to Ilyasi's men, right?

671
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:38,810
Sir, he's a liability now.

672
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:41,640
All his accounts and assets
have been frozen.

673
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:45,140
What if the CIA or Indian Intelligence
track us?

674
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,480
So you believe Rizwan Ilyasi is finished?

675
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:54,190
Many people have made the same
mistake for over 20 years.

676
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,730
They imagine Rizwan Ilyasi's
time is up. He's finished. Over.

677
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:00,520
But he always comes back.

678
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,600
Do you play chess?

679
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:08,100
Say you're playing with four extra
pieces that are invisible.

680
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:12,730
Rook, Knight, Bishop and Pawn.

681
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:18,020
And your opponent doesn't know it.
Can you ever be defeated?

682
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:23,310
These four bank accounts
are his invisible chess pieces.

683
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:26,810
All powerful people. All at the top.

684
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:30,980
The Indian Army, the Government,
Intelligence.

685
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:36,890
As long as they are in play,
no one can checkmate Rizwan.

686
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:41,020
So he can attack whenever
he wants. And he will.

687
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,230
Soon there'll be a big explosion
in India.

688
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,390
Osama Bin Laden will be history.

689
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,520
This attack will cost the earth.

690
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,140
I could retire on the commission alone.

691
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:57,800
- So, get going with this.
- Sure, sir.

692
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:01,020
Make the transfers first thing.
I leave Italy tomorrow.

693
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:07,890
That's how I lost in love

694
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,930
That's how I lost in love

695
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:13,890
That's how you lost in love

696
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:16,840
That's how you lost in love

697
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:19,920
That's how I lost in love

698
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:23,270
That's how I lost in love

699
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:26,860
That's how I lost in love

700
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,890
Great session, guys!

701
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:35,020
- Bye.
- Thank you.

702
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,350
True enterprising Indian!

703
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,890
One job is not enough. I need
to make a lot of money quickly.

704
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:52,440
What's wrong?

705
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,350
I know that look.

706
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:01,480
Someone was lying and must now
tell the truth.

707
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:09,140
Let me guess. You forgot
to say you're married.

708
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,060
Girlfriend?

709
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:16,520
Your Mummy has found you a bride.

710
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,810
Boyfriend?

711
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,520
There must be something.

712
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:26,940
Yeah.

713
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:34,190
Is my heart gonna break?

714
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:36,810
Maybe.

715
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,600
So it was all lies, Kabir.

716
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,940
Friendship, love, connection.

717
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,060
All of it.

718
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,890
You were just using me.

719
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:05,350
Firoze has been crazy about you
for a long time, Naina.

720
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,060
I needed you...

721
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,440
...as a backup.

722
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,980
In our world, you're known
as "a civilian asset."

723
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:23,440
So was I your civilian asset?

724
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,730
That's all?

725
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:32,600
Think about Ruhi.

726
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:41,690
So you know about her too?

727
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:45,890
She's been at boarding school
for 6 years. No father.

728
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:49,190
Her mother has been dancing
the world over...

729
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:53,020
...to save up dollars and euros
so that one day...

730
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:57,190
...they can both live together.

731
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:03,730
I can make your three-year plan...

732
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:07,480
...work in a day, Naina.

733
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,980
It's a good deal.

734
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,640
Kabir. Or whatever your real name is...

735
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:45,020
...are you married?

736
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,980
Obviously, you don't have any kids.

737
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,850
That's why it's easy for you
to propose this deal to me.

738
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,850
My only ties are to my country, Naina.

739
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:04,100
I'm an Indian soldier.
First and foremost.

740
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:08,230
You're an army officer's daughter...

741
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,350
...so I thought you'd understand.

742
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:16,190
Your research is pretty solid.

743
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,890
Not everyone is a soldier.

744
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:22,850
Nor has everyone vowed to save India.

745
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:25,980
Some people just try to provide...

746
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:30,270
...a happy and simple life
for their children.

747
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:37,270
For ordinary people like me
this is our daily battle.

748
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:44,560
Trust me, Naina, if I had an option,
I wouldn't have come to you.

749
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,480
There's only one day left.

750
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:49,940
Firoze leaves tomorrow.

751
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:55,230
He's my only link to India's
most dangerous enemy, Ilyasi.

752
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,520
Ilyasi has murdered
many innocent people.

753
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:03,640
He won't stop.

754
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:11,100
And if he is not stopped,
he will destroy India.

755
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,600
Coming for the Sports Day?

756
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:35,060
All the parents were here
on Painting Day except you.

757
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:37,190
So sorry, Ruhi, I couldn't make it.

758
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:40,060
But you know what? Sister Mary
sent me your painting.

759
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:41,560
I thought it was brilliant.

760
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:44,140
I carry it with me everywhere.

761
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:48,270
I'm coming on Sports Day,
with all your gifts.

762
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:49,600
Really?

763
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:53,190
Thank you, Mama. Bye.
I'll talk to you later.

764
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:55,390
I'm getting late for my music class.

765
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:58,730
- I love you, my sweet. Bye!
- Love you, Mama.

766
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,190
Sister Mary, is Ruhi all right?

767
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,350
She's a very bright child, Naina.

768
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:10,020
Very studious and good at sports.

769
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:12,190
But she misses you terribly.

770
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,730
Try and find more time for her.

771
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,140
I'm trying.

772
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,350
I'm working on it.

773
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:21,810
Thank you.

774
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:56,310
I have no idea if this is a patriot
talking or a desperate mother...

775
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,270
...but I'm on, Kabir.

776
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:01,140
What must I do?

777
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,560
I promise you.

778
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,100
You'll be safe.

779
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,190
I don't trust you, Kabir.

780
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:15,980
A loner like you who has no family
cannot be trusted.

781
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:21,190
But I can't walk away from your deal.

782
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,270
I promise you, Naina.

783
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,390
I won't let you come to any harm.

784
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:32,270
I can read it in your eyes that
you're a loyal soldier.

785
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:37,350
Every soldier has someone they long
to go home to.

786
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,560
But you've chosen
the path of martyrdom.

787
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,810
Can a martyr be trusted with a life?

788
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:50,310
Find someone to go home to, Kabir.

789
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,730
You'll start believing in relationships.

790
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:08,350
Naina and Ruhi surfing in Australia.

791
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:10,770
Ruhi's dream holiday.

792
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:17,440
It'll remind you – Naina, your civilian
asset, is not alone with Firoze...

793
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,310
...the 6-year-old Ruhi is with her too.

794
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:28,140
I'll take the picture back
when your job is done.

795
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:54,090
Naina.

796
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:57,510
Firoze never parts with his laptop.

797
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:59,760
He has a private network.

798
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:02,890
Connect this drive to his laptop
when you get the chance.

799
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,180
30 seconds.

800
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:08,140
The drive will copy all his data.

801
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:12,970
I'll know his next plans and the
identity of his invisible chess pieces.

802
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,180
Going somewhere?

803
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:37,800
Yes. This is my last night here.

804
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:40,890
Destiny smiles on me.

805
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:43,300
- Wine?
- Sure.

806
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:48,890
A bottle of Château Latour, please.
1978.

807
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,090
Come.

808
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:53,930
Yeah.

809
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:02,930
Sir?

810
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:05,090
Minister Sherna has decided, Kabir...

811
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,050
...if there's no progress,
you're coming back tomorrow.

812
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:11,140
Colonel, I'll call you first thing.
I'm in the middle of an operation.

813
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:11,930
What?

814
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,220
It's a honey trap.

815
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,010
There's a girl Firoze has been trying
to date for months.

816
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,390
She's connecting our drive
to his laptop.

817
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:20,430
Good work.

818
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,720
Send me the report immediately, Kabir.
Not tomorrow.

819
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:24,840
Yes, sir.

820
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,140
- Not now, Aditi.
- It's urgent.

821
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:45,890
OK, what?

822
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:48,680
Contractor's girls.
There's an odd one out.

823
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:49,640
OK.

824
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:53,140
Many are high-end models,
exotic dancers and actresses.

825
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,050
Between 15 and 25.

826
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:57,260
- Who's the odd one out?
- A 40-year-old doctor.

827
01:27:57,550 --> 01:27:58,010
So?

828
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,760
She's among the world's leading
plastic surgeons.

829
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:03,970
She runs a clinic in Zurich.
Only millionaires can afford her.

830
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:06,260
OK. I'll check the video.
Name and date?

831
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,430
Dr. Malika Singhal,
12th March, 7pm.

832
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,720
12th March, 7pm.

833
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:24,720
OK. Putting you on speaker.

834
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:27,470
Yeah, sure.

835
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,090
You take the first left.
And the left after that. OK?

836
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:30,930
Thank you.

837
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:55,220
Very nice.

838
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:57,340
Your face has the right blood supply.

839
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:02,260
What can I say? Blood is rushing
to every part of my body, doctor!

840
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,140
Careful!

841
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,970
Firoze Contractor was not so flirty.

842
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:13,090
If you behave out of character,
people will get suspicious.

843
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:16,470
With your new face, your personality
must change too.

844
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,180
For me and the world...

845
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,760
...you are now Firoze Contractor.

846
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:32,390
With your new face, your personality
must change too.

847
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:35,050
For me and the world...

848
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:37,840
...you are now Firoze Contractor.

849
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,390
Sir, I hacked Dr. Malika's
hospital server.

850
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:44,010
I found some important information.

851
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:45,840
You must see it.

852
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,840
Firoze is...

853
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:58,430
...Rizwan Ilyasi!

854
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,340
Lost something?

855
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:14,840
What a mistake, darling.

856
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,720
That laptop does not belong
to Firoze Contractor.

857
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:19,930
It belongs to Rizwan Ilyasi.

858
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:25,680
Anyone who happens to see Rizwan...

859
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:30,160
...is soon awaited in Heaven.

860
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,550
I promise you, I won't let
any harm come to you.

861
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:24,340
I don't trust you, Kabir.

862
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:30,590
It'll remind you – Naina, your civilian
asset is not alone with Firoze...

863
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:33,050
...the 6-year-old Ruhi is with her too.

864
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,390
Sir, you've stayed silent for days.

865
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,300
You should update the Colonel.

866
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,640
The Colonel was the only one aware
that Naina was with Firoze.

867
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:15,800
And ten minutes later, she was dead.

868
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:18,090
Do you think the Colonel...?

869
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:21,090
Rook, Knight, Bishop and Pawn.

870
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:27,430
I cannot trust anyone till these
four invisible pieces are found.

871
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:30,550
But how will you find them?

872
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,510
- Will you help me?
- Of course, sir.

873
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,840
Background checks.

874
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:41,590
You mean the Colonel?
Anyone else?

875
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:45,090
Who did the Colonel call
after he and I spoke on the phone?

876
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:47,890
I'll check his tax records
and bank accounts.

877
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:50,760
Credit cards don't pay
for treason, Aditi.

878
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,260
Dig up something else.

879
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:58,010
Have any of his friends benefitted
recently? Or...

880
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:01,140
- Know what I mean?
- Yes.

881
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:05,340
If I find something,
what will you do?

882
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,260
V.K. Naidu.

883
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,550
The Colonel spoke to him
2 minutes after your call.

884
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:17,640
And?

885
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,510
Very suspicious.

886
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:22,090
He has anonymous bank accounts,
properties...

887
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,590
...and cash gifts from Indians abroad.

888
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:27,050
Someone is keeping him in luxury.

889
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:29,590
We took our eyes off him.

890
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:32,680
Thanks, Aditi.
I have my eye on him now.

891
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,550
Kabir!

892
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:39,220
You.

893
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:42,800
Rizwan has four chess pieces.
You're one of them.

894
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:44,800
You're mistaken.

895
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,260
Who are the other three?

896
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:48,930
I swear, Kabir, I don't know what
you're talking about.

897
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,970
Bishop. Rook. Knight. Pawn.

898
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:57,590
Kabir, please.
I'm losing a lot of blood.

899
01:33:57,890 --> 01:33:59,390
I want an ambulance.

900
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:02,550
Rook, Knight, Pawn.

901
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,510
Then I'll call an ambulance.

902
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:09,180
Not three. There are only two others.

903
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,390
Who?

904
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:14,050
I only know the man I report to.

905
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:17,220
Name, Naidu? I need a name.

906
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:18,930
Shroff!

907
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:21,260
Jimmy Shroff.

908
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:24,050
Lt. Col. Jimmy Shroff.

909
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:26,760
Did you tell him about Naina?

910
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:30,340
Kabir, give me a chance to explain.

911
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,760
I will.

912
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,640
In hell.

913
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:41,680
Who are Ilyasi's two other chess pieces
besides Naidu?

914
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:43,720
Not two. There's only one.

915
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:47,010
- Name?
- Biswas. Dr. Utpal Biswas.

916
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:48,550
What's Rizwan's next move?

917
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:52,800
I was told to hand over a drive from
Biswas to Rizwan. That's all I know.

918
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:54,140
Let me go!

919
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,050
You'll have to memorize the formulas...

920
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,340
...and then explain it to people here.

921
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:27,140
Most of them haven't
really understood...

922
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:35,090
Dr. Utpal Biswas,
ISRO's chief for 9 years.

923
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:38,430
A key member of the Garuda
Defence Satellite launch team.

924
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:40,890
Awarded the highest government honours...

925
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:43,890
...even considered for a Nobel prize.

926
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:47,140
The Colonel rang me.
But I don't understand why.

927
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:49,180
I don't know him.

928
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:53,050
Your safety is my responsibility
till we learn more.

929
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,300
What's all this?

930
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,800
- I need to make some calls.
- No calls.

931
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:00,390
You can't talk to anyone
till we get to India.

932
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,430
All right.

933
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:12,050
Come in.

934
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,390
- Lunch.
- Yes, please.

935
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:38,300
Hello.

936
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:40,260
I need the codes.

937
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:41,910
They're ready.

938
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:43,930
We have a problem.

939
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:46,940
They're taking me to Delhi
under tight security.

940
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,090
"Delhi's still far away."

941
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:50,720
Meaning?

942
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:54,970
It's Persian for "Delhi's still far away."

943
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:26,010
Oh no!

944
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:52,390
Bring the chopper!

945
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:17,930
Who are you?

946
01:39:21,970 --> 01:39:22,890
Where's Ilyasi?

947
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:25,140
No idea.

948
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:30,470
- Who's the Pawn?
- What?

949
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:36,890
I've killed two men, doctor.

950
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:39,470
What's a third to me!

951
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:43,430
Naidu, Shroff and you.

952
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:46,010
Who is Ilyasi's fourth man?

953
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:49,090
No fourth man.

954
01:39:49,470 --> 01:39:50,970
If there was one...

955
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:54,300
...only Rizwan Ilyasi knows who he is.

956
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:58,180
I've never known Rizwan's whereabouts.

957
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:03,300
Where's the drive?

958
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:06,140
Where's the drive?

959
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:07,650
Here.

960
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:49,640
Suspect on the bridge.

961
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:08,480
Suspect on the bridge.
Need backup.

962
01:45:17,550 --> 01:45:18,880
He's got the codes.

963
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:21,010
What codes?

964
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:24,390
The nuclear code?
My bank account code?

965
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,760
No one told me about a drive.

966
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:28,680
So how did Kabir know?

967
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:31,220
- Believe me, sir...
- Believe you?

968
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,680
You two were strolling about
in the metro. And you did nothing.

969
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:41,300
He was alone and he still got Biswas.

970
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:46,970
The Defence Minister Sherna Patel
asked me, "Is he in Kabir's team?

971
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,550
"Or ours?"

972
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:53,380
It's not fair, Colonel.

973
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:56,090
Tell that to Dr. Biswas...

974
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:02,740
...and the eight dead
Portuguese soldiers.

975
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:05,180
You are out.

976
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:40,050
Saini, I know you're in charge now.
But if something comes to mind...

977
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:43,010
...if I make some connection,
should I inform you or not?

978
01:46:45,050 --> 01:46:47,010
There is something.

979
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:50,890
While I was recovering after
the Marrakesh mission...

980
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:53,680
...Kabir went to Italy on an assignment.

981
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:56,890
That was his last case
before he killed Naidu.

982
01:46:58,050 --> 01:46:59,340
What was it?

983
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:01,720
OK. One second.

984
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:03,930
Yes.

985
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:07,890
Firoze Contractor.

986
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:10,930
OK.

987
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:13,840
Saini, I need the case details.

988
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:49,180
Come on!

989
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:52,680
Ready?

990
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,220
Merry Christmas, Mama.

991
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:08,890
Merry Christmas, Naina.

992
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,050
Kabir! Look at this cycle.

993
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:17,340
Wow!

994
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:20,800
"To my darling Ruhi.

995
01:48:20,970 --> 01:48:24,220
"I'm watching over you always.
Love, Mama."

996
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:30,470
Did you know I asked for a cycle?

997
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:33,220
- Just now?
- Yeah!

998
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,260
- Really?
- Yeah.

999
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:37,440
My God! That's amazing, Ruhi.

1000
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:42,260
Thank you.

1001
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:44,430
I love you, my Santa.

1002
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:55,430
You're a very smart girl, Ruhi,
I love you so much.

1003
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:57,550
That's a nice cycle.

1004
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:11,680
What's wrong, Ruhi?

1005
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:15,300
Ruhi does not talk to strangers.

1006
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,140
I'm no stranger.

1007
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:22,220
I'm Kabir's friend.

1008
01:49:22,970 --> 01:49:24,800
I know all about you.

1009
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:26,890
And Naina.

1010
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:30,220
I'm serious. Asked Kabir.

1011
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:32,550
Who is he, Kabir?

1012
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:36,300
His name is Khalid.

1013
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:40,430
He was my student once...

1014
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:44,530
...now he thinks he's better
than his teacher.

1015
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:49,550
How did you find us, Khalid?

1016
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:50,840
Santa Claus.

1017
01:49:51,390 --> 01:49:53,390
Rudolph, the red nose guy?

1018
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,050
I know him well.

1019
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:58,140
I asked him: "Where's Miss Ruhi?"

1020
01:49:58,570 --> 01:50:01,470
As if! There's no Santa Claus.

1021
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,590
Kabir gave me this cycle.

1022
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:06,010
What? No Santa Claus?

1023
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:10,590
Kabir, your friend is just like you.
He tells tall tales like you.

1024
01:50:11,550 --> 01:50:14,340
Let's go or the matron will scold me.

1025
01:50:14,890 --> 01:50:15,890
Go, Ruhi.

1026
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:19,260
I'll wish Khalid "Merry Christmas"
and join you.

1027
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:20,930
Bye, Khalid.

1028
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:23,180
Bye, Ruhi. Merry Christmas.

1029
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:29,090
You should've fired on sight.

1030
01:50:29,970 --> 01:50:31,590
Now your conscience will stop you.

1031
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:35,550
It's Christmas. School. Kids.

1032
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:40,300
Shall we talk without guns?

1033
01:50:46,590 --> 01:50:47,930
Rook.

1034
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:49,430
Knight.

1035
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:51,140
Bishop.

1036
01:50:52,470 --> 01:50:53,510
Pawn?

1037
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:57,510
Naidu. Shroff. Biswas.

1038
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,300
I'm looking for the fourth piece.

1039
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:06,550
- Wasn't Saurabh the Pawn?
- No.

1040
01:51:09,090 --> 01:51:11,220
Whoever he is, he's still alive.

1041
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:14,140
He's still on Ilyasi's payroll.

1042
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:20,330
So, Firoze Contractor is Rizwan Ilyasi?

1043
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:22,680
Yeah.

1044
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:27,080
He's planning something big, Khalid.

1045
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:30,180
It's all on the drive.

1046
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:33,010
What is? What codes?

1047
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:36,340
I gave it to an expert. She'll crack
the encrypted codes.

1048
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:38,510
Hopefully soon...

1049
01:51:58,550 --> 01:52:01,180
- What name did you travel under?
- My own.

1050
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:03,890
Our names are flagged, Khalid.

1051
01:52:09,010 --> 01:52:09,800
The Colonel?

1052
01:52:11,550 --> 01:52:12,260
Cover me.

1053
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:26,590
Your disk, sir.

1054
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,520
A gift on my wedding day.

1055
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:32,760
The encryption was AES level.
So it took time to decode.

1056
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:34,430
And?

1057
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:37,890
Satellite Brahma's orbit vectors.

1058
01:54:38,930 --> 01:54:39,640
Meaning?

1059
01:54:40,260 --> 01:54:43,220
Brahma. India's defence satellite.

1060
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,800
It covers the border and key
areas like Siachen and Kargil.

1061
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:49,300
No wires or mobile towers there.

1062
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:52,510
This satellite is the army's only means
of communication.

1063
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:56,090
- Are these Brahma's orbit codes?
- Exactly.

1064
01:54:56,470 --> 01:54:58,510
They show Brahma's position.

1065
01:54:58,890 --> 01:55:01,260
These codes can lock
the satellite's functioning.

1066
01:55:03,180 --> 01:55:04,550
They can bring it down.

1067
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:06,930
And our soldiers at the border?

1068
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:09,260
They'd be helpless.

1069
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:11,840
We'd have zero contact.

1070
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:15,550
The enemy could cross the LOC
without our knowledge.

1071
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:17,890
Like Kargil?

1072
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:21,390
Worse.

1073
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:28,890
Without the satellite, the enemy
could enter our country.

1074
01:55:29,470 --> 01:55:31,840
And change the face of India.

1075
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,260
Without warning.

1076
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:39,510
Ilyasi was right.

1077
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:44,930
If a defence satellite could be
successfully destroyed...

1078
01:55:45,890 --> 01:55:48,260
...Osama and ISIS would be history.

1079
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:52,930
But without this drive,
Ilyasi can do nothing. Right?

1080
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:54,590
Right.

1081
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:56,050
Khalid.

1082
01:55:59,550 --> 01:56:00,550
Keep this safe.

1083
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:04,090
Very, very safe.

1084
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:05,590
Yes, sir.

1085
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:08,720
Thank you, Aditi.

1086
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:12,180
You're a true solider.

1087
01:56:12,970 --> 01:56:16,640
Just say the word, sir,
I'll elope with you tomorrow!

1088
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:19,300
Get in line.

1089
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:39,340
We're at the jetty in 10 minutes.

1090
01:56:39,590 --> 01:56:40,800
Yes, sir.

1091
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:56,470
Thank you.

1092
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:01,390
Sir, you must! Please allow me.

1093
01:57:01,970 --> 01:57:03,140
Of course.

1094
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:05,800
What are we celebrating?

1095
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:09,390
Your innocence and the
health of the nation!

1096
01:57:09,970 --> 01:57:11,800
It's not yet over, Khalid.

1097
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:17,050
We have no proof that
the Colonel is Ilyasi's Pawn.

1098
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:20,840
We can prove it. Nothing to fear.

1099
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:25,140
Cheers!

1100
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:32,760
- No, sir. No thanks.
- Come on, Khalid.

1101
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:35,760
A drink is shared, even with an enemy.

1102
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:23,800
Rook.

1103
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:25,930
Knight.

1104
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:28,970
Bishop.

1105
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:33,970
All useless.

1106
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:38,180
The Pawn!

1107
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:43,050
When the Pawn reaches
the last square...

1108
01:58:46,390 --> 01:58:48,300
...it becomes anything it wants.

1109
01:58:49,010 --> 01:58:51,390
It's a game-changer.

1110
01:58:51,970 --> 01:58:54,300
No one can stop it.

1111
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:19,890
I'm sorry, brother.

1112
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:23,180
They took our mobiles.
I didn't get a chance to call you.

1113
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:26,760
Saurabh, if you weren't here today.
it'd be all over.

1114
02:00:28,550 --> 02:00:31,390
You turned out to be the most loyal.

1115
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:34,930
What's the use?
They know my face now.

1116
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:37,260
They know my face too.

1117
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:40,340
But very soon this face...

1118
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:43,430
Face?

1119
02:00:47,970 --> 02:00:50,760
Your role is not over yet, Saurabh.

1120
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:53,390
Saurabh, meet Dr. Malika Singhal.

1121
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:55,840
The world's best plastic surgeon.

1122
02:00:56,340 --> 02:01:00,300
Even God could go wrong when
creating a face. But not her.

1123
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:06,260
I'm in no hurry for a new face.
I want that face...

1124
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:11,390
You turned out to be the most loyal
of all my men.

1125
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:01,680
His face will be perfect, even
his mother couldn't tell the difference.

1126
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:05,930
He'll have a few minor scars,
but I'll cover them cosmetically.

1127
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:10,550
I'll work on Saurabh's vocal cords.

1128
02:02:10,970 --> 02:02:14,800
And modulate his voice with a laser.

1129
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:18,640
It will not be perfect, but it will do.

1130
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:46,220
"We walked through life side by side.

1131
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:49,550
"Followed by our shadows.

1132
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:53,800
"So many were the signs..."

1133
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:00,800
Thought you were smart!

1134
02:03:06,430 --> 02:03:08,390
I spiked your drink with TTX.

1135
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:12,470
The world's most potent neurotoxin.

1136
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:19,300
The good thing is that
you'll feel no pain.

1137
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:22,550
It'll be over soon.

1138
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:26,430
Sir!

1139
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:30,590
You see, sir...

1140
02:03:31,050 --> 02:03:34,430
...you're paid a monthly salary
of 70,000 to protect your country.

1141
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:38,300
And to sell your country...

1142
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:40,800
...you could earn 70 million.

1143
02:03:43,510 --> 02:03:45,050
Long live India!

1144
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:47,970
You've served your country well.

1145
02:03:52,890 --> 02:03:56,510
The country is in my hands now.

1146
02:05:20,670 --> 02:05:22,080
We're in position.

1147
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:10,080
The missile is trained on the target.

1148
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:15,170
This button will activate it.

1149
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:17,080
Ten minutes later...

1150
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:22,080
...with Brahma destroyed, the soldiers
at the border will be helpless.

1151
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:25,210
Take God's name.

1152
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:27,960
I don't get on with God.

1153
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:30,920
The button is yours to press, Saurabh.

1154
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:33,880
None of this was possible
without you.

1155
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:47,210
Impossible!

1156
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:50,500
I shot you myself.

1157
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:55,250
To think I trusted you.

1158
02:07:57,130 --> 02:07:58,290
Saurabh.

1159
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:02,920
You told me a story yesterday.

1160
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:06,670
My turn today.

1161
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:14,250
Khalid had only one weakness.

1162
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:18,580
A blind spot in his right eye.

1163
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:22,420
Only I knew that.

1164
02:08:24,040 --> 02:08:26,880
That day a miracle took place.

1165
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:30,470
Your vision was 20/20.

1166
02:08:32,130 --> 02:08:34,960
Either your mother's prayers
were answered...

1167
02:08:36,630 --> 02:08:39,330
...or Ilyasi did not only change
his own face...

1168
02:08:43,170 --> 02:08:44,920
...but his Pawn's face too.

1169
02:08:46,130 --> 02:08:47,080
That's it?

1170
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:50,250
That's what gave me away?

1171
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:55,800
Saurabh's body was never found.

1172
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:58,420
Now I understand why.

1173
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:02,540
On our way to Aditi's wedding...

1174
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:04,170
Your suspicions were right.

1175
02:09:04,670 --> 02:09:06,380
I checked the surveillance cameras.

1176
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:07,380
And?

1177
02:09:07,790 --> 02:09:10,750
Khalid was suspended,
yet he came back to work.

1178
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:13,540
I checked the vault.

1179
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:17,750
Everything was in order. But a vial
of TTX was missing.

1180
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,670
No log entry was made.

1181
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,170
Then I made a plan.

1182
02:09:23,330 --> 02:09:25,670
I told Aditi to make an antidote
for the TTX...

1183
02:09:26,290 --> 02:09:28,630
...and put a tracker in the disk.

1184
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:32,250
Khalid, keep this safe.

1185
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:35,330
Very, very safe.

1186
02:09:35,710 --> 02:09:36,960
Yes, sir.

1187
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:40,790
Aditi gave me the antidote.

1188
02:09:41,850 --> 02:09:45,640
There was poison in your purpose.
Not in the drink.

1189
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:50,330
When you drank the wine,
I knew for sure.

1190
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:55,920
Khalid believed alcohol is forbidden.
Worse than forbidden.

1191
02:09:56,680 --> 02:10:00,110
Why go to all this trouble?

1192
02:10:01,370 --> 02:10:04,040
Why didn't you just shoot me on sight?

1193
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:08,510
It was a set-up, so I could give you...

1194
02:10:10,290 --> 02:10:12,470
...the drive with the tracker...

1195
02:10:13,790 --> 02:10:18,670
...so you'd lead me to Ilyasi.

1196
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:23,210
You've lost, Major Kabir.

1197
02:10:24,090 --> 02:10:28,460
The missile will soon blow
your great country's...

1198
02:10:29,290 --> 02:10:30,960
...defence satellite to pieces.

1199
02:10:34,630 --> 02:10:35,330
Really?

1200
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:36,670
What the hell!

1201
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:41,500
It's impossible!

1202
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:43,750
- What's going on?
- I don't know, sir.

1203
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:46,290
The missile was trained at Brahma.

1204
02:10:46,710 --> 02:10:49,810
After it was activated,
the coordinates were changed.

1205
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:54,000
Nonsense!

1206
02:10:54,330 --> 02:10:56,670
Sir, I can't stop it.
The missile is engaged.

1207
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:00,250
So where is it headed?

1208
02:11:00,670 --> 02:11:02,170
Nowhere.

1209
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:05,800
It's turning back on us.

1210
02:11:07,330 --> 02:11:09,170
Our location coordinates were entered.

1211
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:15,290
Time to leave.

1212
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:26,580
Drop it, Saurabh.

1213
02:11:27,470 --> 02:11:29,090
Still ordering me around?

1214
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:31,390
Old habits die hard.

1215
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:35,760
Drop it, Saurabh. Drop it!

1216
02:11:37,010 --> 02:11:39,890
There must be something
about my new face.

1217
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:43,140
Everyone trusts it.

1218
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:45,400
Sorry, boss.

1219
02:11:46,930 --> 02:11:48,640
The Pawn has reached the last square.

1220
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,840
Checkmate!

1221
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:21,840
This face was Khalid's.

1222
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:29,640
I won't let you die with this face.

1223
02:21:33,550 --> 02:21:35,470
I won't let you die with this face.

1224
02:23:44,510 --> 02:23:46,090
Welcome back, Kabir.

1225
02:23:47,050 --> 02:23:48,220
You're a hero.

1226
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:50,300
No, sir.

1227
02:23:51,890 --> 02:23:55,470
I could only kill Ilyasi because
Khalid saved my life.

1228
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:59,010
He took a bullet for me, sir.

1229
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:03,470
For me - the man who killed his father.

1230
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:09,760
What greater proof can there be
of Khalid's patriotism?

1231
02:24:12,890 --> 02:24:15,340
He's the true hero of this war.

1232
02:24:17,590 --> 02:24:20,720
I want the credit of this mission
to go to him.

1233
02:24:23,430 --> 02:24:24,430
And you?

1234
02:24:27,140 --> 02:24:28,720
I'm a traitor, sir.

1235
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:39,680
I think we both know...

1236
02:24:39,890 --> 02:24:44,090
...I'm more effective alone
than operating within the system.

1237
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:49,260
And until the day my loyalty is
up for sale...

1238
02:24:50,590 --> 02:24:53,680
...there'll be other buyers like Ilyasi.

1239
02:24:56,180 --> 02:24:57,800
I'll be ready for them.

1240
02:25:01,890 --> 02:25:03,390
The war is still on, sir.

1241
02:25:07,470 --> 02:25:08,890
You have a good day.

1242
02:25:15,890 --> 02:25:17,470
Captain Khalid Rahmani...

1243
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:22,340
...fought valiantly and bravely
against the terrorists.

1244
02:25:22,970 --> 02:25:26,340
He martyred his life
for his team's safety.

1245
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:32,300
Like a true soldier, he made the
ultimate sacrifice for the nation.

1246
02:25:33,010 --> 02:25:37,090
The deceased Capt. Khalid Rahmani
has been honoured by the government.

1247
02:25:37,340 --> 02:25:41,550
To receive the award, we request
his mother Nafisa Rahmani...

1248
02:25:41,930 --> 02:25:44,180
...to come onto the stage.

1249
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:21,340
Good morning, Colonel.

1250
02:26:21,590 --> 02:26:22,930
What are you doing, my rogue agent?

1251
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:27,550
I was once told soldiers must have...

1252
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:30,260
...someone to go home to.

1253
02:26:31,140 --> 02:26:33,430
So I'm on home duty, sir.

1254
02:26:34,010 --> 02:26:34,930
How's Ruhi?

1255
02:26:37,390 --> 02:26:38,840
She's fine, sir.

1256
02:26:42,970 --> 02:26:44,840
She's flying back to India today.

1257
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:46,680
What's your programme?

1258
02:26:47,470 --> 02:26:49,340
I'm looking for a cheap flight somewhere.

1259
02:26:50,590 --> 02:26:52,430
Any suggestions?

1260
02:26:53,390 --> 02:26:56,890
Your old friend is off to Muscat
for a motivational seminar.
