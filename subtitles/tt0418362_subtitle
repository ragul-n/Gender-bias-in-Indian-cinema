1
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,235
FiVe! FiVe!

2
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,743
Greetings, sire.
- May you be happy

3
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:58,252
Please take a look at my grandson's
horoscope and predict his future

4
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,253
Certainly

5
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,754
Let me see your forehead

6
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:08,762
The lines on his forehead
make it so obVious...

7
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,597
that the fury of Jupiter, the Sun,
Mars and Saturn will rule his life

8
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:17,263
They will dominate his life totally!
Should he be proVoked by someone...

9
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:21,604
this boy will certainly
not spare him

10
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:24,777
What should we name him?

11
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:28,281
Sameer. A gust of cool breeze.
- Sameer...?

12
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,012
By nature, he's hot-headed.
The name will keep him calm

13
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:36,289
Come to me, come...

14
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,297
Guess what? Don't eVer make the
mistake of getting him married

15
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,962
There you are! He has kicked me!

16
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:54,307
As he grows up, he'll use his fists
and kicks more than his mouth!

17
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,001
l'm not sparing you!

18
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,072
l'm not sparing you! NeVer!

19
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:49,520
Sameer! Let him go! LeaVe him alone!

20
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,367
C'mon, Sameer! Come with me!

21
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,103
Sameer, why did you raise
your hand at the Principal?

22
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,430
When l lose my temper...

23
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,976
it feels as if a hundred guitars
are playing in my brains!

24
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:08,040
Now tell me something.
Why did you hit Chintu?

25
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,384
l was angry because he abused you!

26
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:15,386
Sameer, my mother says, anger
is loVe's worst enemy

27
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:18,448
One who can't control his temper,
can't control anything in his lifetime

28
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:21,723
Now stop being angry
and smile. Smile!

29
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:25,789
So you won't smile...? l'll set
your mood right in a moment

30
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,733
The insolent!
- Go topless

31
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:32,000
Those with iron pajamas...
- HaVe an ape for an Uncle!

32
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:35,736
Whose aunts are cats...
- HaVe dogs for friends!

33
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,904
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!

34
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,412
Sameer gets into a fight with
someone or the other eVery day...

35
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:47,750
and today, he raised his hands
on me! The Principal!

36
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:53,419
So much of anger is not good, Ma'am.
lt's Arun who always calms him down

37
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:57,487
He was born with the temper.
How will l explain...?

38
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:03,436
EVer since his parents haVe died, his
temper is getting worse and worse

39
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,028
l understand, ma'am.

40
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:07,097
And that is why l'm not throwing
him out of the school

41
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,438
But l'm really worried. lf this is
how Sameer Malhotra's childhood is...

42
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,707
how is his adolescence going to be?

43
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,522
So these three fractures
and the 36 stitches...

44
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,252
is it all your doing?
- Yes, sir. l'Ve thrashed them

45
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,528
But you must ask them why l hit them

46
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,546
There's this girl Sameer
wants to marry...

47
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,952
and these guys were treating her
like a ball in the basket!

48
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,958
ln 1998, you beat up a professor
in the college?

49
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,153
He didn't haVe any time
to teach the boys

50
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,563
But he used to call the girls home
all alone and gaVe them tuitions

51
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,966
He had eVil on his mind.
So l gaVe it to him!

52
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,162
What wrong did l do?

53
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:20,571
ln the year 2000, you rescued
a man who was drowning...

54
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:24,577
and gaVe him a beating?
- l was the one who saVed him too!

55
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:28,581
There was a board which said in
bold letters, Swimming is forbidden

56
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,984
Why did he go there? l gaVe it
to him... what wrong did l do?

57
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,578
Look, we haVe receiVed
eight complaints..

58
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,250
..against you in the last fiVe years

59
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,986
You might get more

60
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,923
lf l receiVe another complaint,
you're going straight to jail!

61
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,272
Roma...? You'Ve got married?

62
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:02,347
Don't be angry today. Please
don't hit someone

63
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,943
l'll...
- No, wait here

64
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,120
There's no saying when
he might hit someone

65
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,785
You think l'll hit you? Why?
How can l hit you?

66
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,623
l...

67
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,026
And l thought you...

68
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,624
Did you think l'd marry you?
- Yes

69
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,636
HaVe you eVer told me
that you loVe me? - No

70
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:30,640
And look at him. He's
so sweet, so gentle...

71
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,044
he loVes me so much. And you...

72
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:40,312
Now listen to me. No girl can
eVer fall in loVe with you

73
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,814
She can only be afraid of you.
- Why?

74
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,391
You haVe such a temper,
eVen l'm afraid of you

75
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:51,660
Remember how you thrashed those
boys at the basketball court, Sameer?

76
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,257
But they had made a mistake.
They had to be punished

77
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:57,998
EVery human being makes a mistake.
What if l had made a mistake?

78
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:00,666
You'd haVe hit me too, isn't
it? lsn't it true?

79
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,333
Let's go

80
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:27,361
Sameer, are you really going away?
- Yes, grandma

81
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:31,363
l'Ve got the job of a lifeguard
in Goa. lt's a nice job

82
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,104
Besides, l get into a lot
of fights here, grandma

83
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:39,043
lf l go to a new place and meet new
people, l might not get into fights

84
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,707
My son, think again before you go

85
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,309
The reason behind the
fights is your temper

86
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:50,881
Your temper will go with
you whereVer you go

87
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,224
Yes, brother. lf you leaVe, l'll
be worried about you all the time

88
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:57,457
You're the one l'll worry about.

89
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:01,058
l'Ve got to get you
educated and married

90
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:03,729
l'Ve got to haVe an operation
conducted on grandma's eyes...

91
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,897
and send her to grandpa
in heaVen at the earliest

92
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,743
l'm not going away in a hurry.
He'll haVe to wait!

93
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,746
But before you leaVe, you'll
haVe to promise me...

94
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:19,081
that you won't get into fights
and brawls with anyone

95
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,485
ls that clear, my son?

96
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:27,157
Grandma, l swear it on your head

97
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:31,254
l'll neVer lose my temper again

98
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,950
One, two...

99
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,792
is that your luggage, mister?
Also this bag?

100
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:08,528
Four...? Four bags?

101
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,131
Yes

102
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:13,799
Which is THE bag?

103
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:21,547
l mean, the bag in which you're
carrying the cash and Valuables...?

104
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:26,314
Terrible times, you see. You
could easily be robbed

105
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,822
Robberies are commonplace
in trains nowadays

106
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,825
Difficult to tell the bonafide
passenger from the thief!

107
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:36,488
Go to sleep. l'll stay awake.
- l'm not sleepy

108
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,832
Mister, this period between
3 and 5 in the morning...

109
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,836
is meant to be spent in slumber.
HoweVer strong a man is...

110
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,840
he does drift into it at least once

111
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:52,004
l want to see when you go to sleep.
- l told you, l'm not sleepy

112
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,516
All right. Actually,
l loVe my forty winks

113
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,509
l'm going to sleep

114
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:21,033
Yes, grandma, l'Ve reached
safely. Okay...

115
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,473
Thank you, mister.
- What for?

116
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,944
For looking after my luggage

117
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:31,106
l'll explain. l haVe a weakness.
l can't stay awake in the night

118
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:34,211
And l can't sleep in the train,
for fear of losing my luggage...

119
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,483
and that is why, l pulled
off the fast one

120
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:39,048
So that l could go to sleep and
you'd look after my luggage.

121
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,388
Nice idea, eh?

122
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,895
Know what ? You're a great guy

123
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,295
l think l must traVel with
you on my way back too

124
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:49,631
Here's my card. Phone me on this
number, l'll find you at the station

125
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,904
Help me, grandma!

126
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,973
Praise the Lord...

127
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,417
Lord, protect my grandson
whereVer he is

128
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:06,972
Lord, help Sameer find his loVe

129
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,201
Lord!

130
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:24,653
You...?
- Yes. l'm Raj. He's Paul

131
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:28,456
Our misfortune, we're
brothers. Twins

132
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,053
l'm an astrologer who predicts people's
future from their birthcharts...

133
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,793
and he ruins their future!

134
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,070
What does your brother do?
- He belongs to the Eagle gang...

135
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:41,574
Very dangerous people.
NeVer cross their path

136
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:44,076
NeVer. - You appear to
be a stranger in town

137
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,475
Whom are you Visiting?
- Mr Duggal

138
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:49,071
Mr Duggal!
- Yes, he has a Vacant room

139
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,140
Not just a room, his
brains are empty too

140
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,152
He used to be a police
inspector in Goa...

141
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,245
and has blood clotted in
his head eVer since..

142
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,687
..a thief struck him with a stick

143
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:59,692
WhereVer the clot stands,
that part becomes useless

144
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,251
He plays deaf, dumb and blind

145
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,490
Let's see what he's playing today

146
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,589
He's playing blind today

147
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,830
l don't belieVe this!
- You will, Very soon

148
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,441
That's Mr Duggal!

149
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:23,276
But he's looking at me.
- No, you're looking at him

150
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,341
Let me show you. Wait

151
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,283
Rascals! You hit me because
l'm blind today?

152
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:39,127
When l start seeing again, none of
you will be seen around here again!

153
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,465
Do you belieVe it now? Wait a moment

154
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:47,300
l'm glad you're here.
l haVen't had any tea

155
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,802
GiVe me half a litre of milk

156
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,145
ls the milk oVer, Bansi?

157
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,613
l'm not Bansi. l'm Sameer .

158
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,741
l'm sorry, l thought
you were the milkman

159
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:01,219
When did the headlights go off?

160
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,654
How does that concern you? You're
not a doctor, are you?

161
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:05,658
GiVe me the milk.
- But l'm not a milkman...

162
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:10,425
l'm Raj, the astrologer!
- The astrologer!

163
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:13,898
Such a big mouth!
- lt's not my mouth. lt's a bag

164
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:17,163
And here is your mouth!
- Let me be, please!

165
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,502
What brings you here...?
- l'm the one who came here

166
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:24,169
l'Ve landed a job at the beach resort.
Mr Sharma has had a word with you

167
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,838
For the room, isn't it? Come,
l'll take you to your room

168
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,579
l'll show you to your room

169
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:35,915
Go upstairs from here. Your
room is right ahead. Go on

170
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,792
There's no room there!
- No?

171
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,356
But l saw it last night. Did
it disappear oVernight?

172
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:47,264
Hello. - You're showing
him the wrong place

173
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,201
The room is oVer there!
- Where?

174
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,272
Here! Come with me.
- You're throwing me out...?

175
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,203
We're actually going in!

176
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,610
l'll check out the room later.
Let's talk about the rent first

177
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:04,206
l can pay you 2500 at the most.
- l'll collect at least 5000 rupees!

178
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,809
lt's okay if you agree.
Or you may leaVe...

179
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,219
Hey! lt's me!
- Why do you keep butting in?

180
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:14,386
GiVe him half the room for 2500. Find
another tenant for the other half

181
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,828
ls Bansi staying with you too?
- But l'm not Bansi!

182
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:20,389
Don't be angry. GiVe me
half a litre of milk

183
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,958
But l'm not the milkman! l'm
Raj... the astrologer!

184
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:26,403
So what are you doing here? Go
and look up people's horoscopes

185
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,839
Show Sameer the room.
Come, Sameer...

186
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,399
lt's me!

187
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,910
Where's Sameer?
- Here l am, sir

188
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,575
C'mon

189
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,592
For my grandma's eyesight

190
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,721
For my sister's education

191
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,534
For my sister's marriage

192
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,270
Lord, it's Your responsibility
to haVe an operation..

193
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,772
..conducted on grandma's eyes

194
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:04,607
My sister's education and her
marriage is also Your responsibility

195
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,772
Fill up the coffers at
the earliest, please

196
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:13,081
And okay, it's my responsibility to
make offerings to You at the temple

197
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:34,471
O beautiful one...

198
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:40,707
Come to me

199
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:08,340
Has Mr Duggal asked you to come and
go through the balcony, brother?

200
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,740
No.
- Not your mistake, though

201
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,337
WhoeVer stays in that house, does
take a fall in his lifetime

202
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,848
lt's because of the sight ahead.
- You're right

203
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:20,751
And l wish you keep doing
this to me eVery day

204
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,688
l feel so nice today!

205
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,526
You...? Already here to pick me up?
l told you to call up and come

206
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:38,367
No, l can't go with you so early.
Okay, do something

207
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,566
Look around Goa for a couple of
days, then we'll leaVe together

208
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,880
Who is he?
- Our new manager

209
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,042
He'll kill me!

210
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,054
You sent for me, sir?

211
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:06,125
Are you Suraj?
- No

212
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,396
Suraj Prakash.
- Time for you to set, Suraj (Sun)

213
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,460
You won't eVer rise
in the morning again

214
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:15,474
ln your 14 years of serVice, you
were neVer in the night shift

215
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:18,133
From now on you will work
in the night for a month

216
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,413
Sir, l'll die.
- Two months

217
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,416
l'll be ruined, sir.
- Three months

218
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,576
And listen...
- Yes sir?

219
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:30,418
Sleep is man's worst weakness

220
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,426
And the time between 3 and 5
is the most Vulnerable one

221
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:37,930
lf l see your shoulders droop at
that time, you are off the roster

222
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:40,023
l get it

223
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:54,440
Mr Sameer

224
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,954
When did you get this motorbike?
- My company gaVe it to me today

225
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:08,188
No, you got it yesterday.
- Today

226
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,122
You're talking about the motorbike,
l'm talking about your eyes

227
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,461
You clapped your eyes on
Rani yesterday, right?

228
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:16,525
Rani? Who? l'm watching
the kids play

229
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:20,539
Really? l'm a gifted astrologer

230
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:25,475
l'Ve seen your horoscope. Let
me introduce you to Rani

231
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,979
Else, you will keep falling
off your window

232
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,483
l'm a priest of LoVe. Because of
us priests, two hearts meet...

233
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:34,486
a family is made, new
babies are born..

234
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,886
... there's no greater joy than this

235
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,985
Her father, the colonel,
is a strict man, l hear

236
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:43,552
He's retired. He may
be pulled up any time

237
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,498
He won't find a better son-in-law.
- NeVer

238
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,831
He's going to embrace you
in the first meeting itself

239
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:52,663
Bye

240
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,764
ls Ms Rani cross with you?
- No

241
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,900
Then why is she going that way?

242
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:01,507
Yes, priest?
- Please come here

243
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,675
She's coming

244
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:05,843
Once you guys shake hands..

245
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,682
..it won't take much time
for your hearts to meet

246
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,853
Come... Be prepared

247
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:16,528
HaVen't seen the colonel for days.
- Our car's in the garage

248
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:20,862
He's gone to pick it up.
- lll-fated carburetor, l told him

249
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,526
He must at least fill
gas worth 1 25..

250
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:24,797
..but he won't spend
more than 25 bucks

251
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:28,534
Anyway... this is my childhood
friend Sameer

252
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:35,043
Not that we met in childhood...
the two of us met as adults

253
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:37,049
She's Rani

254
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:39,551
Sameer is a lifeguard, and
Rani is a fashion designer

255
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,611
Won't you shake hands?

256
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,892
Can't you take care of your kid?

257
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,966
What happened?
- A flat tyre?

258
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,901
No, someone got smacked

259
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:00,963
Who?
- Daddy!

260
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:07,736
What an introduction!

261
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:10,749
Who slapped him? lt sounded
like an explosion

262
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:14,583
Are you all right, Papa?
- Don't ask me, dear

263
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:20,320
lt feels as if someone hammered
a hot nail into my ear

264
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,652
You shouldn't haVe hit him so
hard. This boy is naughty

265
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,198
Thank God the colonel applied the
brakes in time and saVed him

266
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:29,667
Are you in your senses?
How dare you hit my Papa?

267
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:33,598
l didn't know he was your
father. And that kid...

268
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:36,107
What kid? Her mother is here, there
are so many people around...

269
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:39,942
but they didn't utter a word!
You wanted to be a hero, eh?

270
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:44,780
Stop fighting and take
him to a doctor, quick

271
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:48,787
Conductor? l need a doctor, dammit!
- That's where we're going

272
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,289
He's gone deaf! What haVe you done?

273
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:54,793
You were to ask Rani's hand from
him and you just handed it out to him

274
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:20,049
Who is Rani, sir?

275
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:25,190
You? Are you working day and night?

276
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:29,319
No sir. l just came to request you

277
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:33,062
Please be kind enough and turn my
bad nights into good nights, sir

278
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,657
What for?
- Because after office hours...

279
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:38,670
when l go home and shut the doors
and windows to catch a wink...

280
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:43,141
the kids around assemble outside
my house and scream together...

281
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,268
The matinee show begins now

282
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:50,681
And my wife takes it out on the
kids saying, No shows of late

283
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,742
Sir, my honour is at stake

284
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,420
All right. GiVe me
some time to think

285
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:00,357
Really? How much time?
- Say, a month or two

286
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:06,855
What?
- When will my duty hours change?

287
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,696
Three months after that

288
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:18,767
Who is this Rani, sir?

289
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:05,416
Youth is short

290
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,086
The rest of life is no good

291
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:20,766
Once...

292
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,274
once it's gone...

293
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:26,779
youth neVer returns

294
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,822
What do you...

295
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:21,162
think about me?

296
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:24,829
Don't take me for a foe

297
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:27,429
Be my friend

298
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:30,999
Lay off. Let me go

299
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:35,241
Don't harass me

300
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:38,841
Sweetheart, so much...

301
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:44,185
of attitude is bad

302
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:46,589
Youth is short

303
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:50,862
The rest of life is no good

304
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,915
My loVe, enjoy...

305
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:48,249
eVery moment

306
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:51,916
What you haVe, is in the present

307
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:54,926
Tomorrow neVer comes

308
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:58,327
l think you are crazy

309
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:02,527
You and l don't sail
in the same boat

310
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:05,935
l can't just...

311
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:11,443
stop following you

312
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:13,945
Youth is short

313
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:17,608
The rest of life is no good

314
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:22,112
Once...

315
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,452
once it's gone...

316
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:27,960
youth neVer returns

317
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,311
Thank God you're here.
l was really worried

318
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:58,653
What for? Aren't we friends now?

319
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:02,317
Yeah, but your father
hasn't forgiVen me yet

320
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:07,326
When things go wrong in the beginning,
it all falls in place in the end

321
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,664
l don't get it. Please explain

322
00:31:10,403 --> 00:31:14,533
l mean, l'Ve brought Papa around
and he has called you oVer for dinner

323
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:16,670
Really?

324
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,012
Look, he's an army officer
who is Very punctual

325
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,672
You will be there at nine sharp

326
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:29,680
l'll be there at eight.
- No way. Neither early, nor late

327
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:41,031
You look Very happy. Tommy's sister
says, see you at home...

328
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:45,029
as if you're going home to become
Tommy's brother-in-law

329
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:50,369
But to impress Tommy's father, don't
forget to buy champagne for him

330
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:53,708
And, you must uncork it at one go!

331
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,376
ls it Sameer?
- Yes, sir

332
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:05,380
Come on in. - Actually sir,
l'Ve come to apologise

333
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:08,717
l committed a mistake the other
day. Please forgiVe me

334
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:12,728
l'Ve forgiVen you, that is why
you are standing before me

335
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:18,734
LoVely dog

336
00:32:19,472 --> 00:32:22,407
He's Tommy, not a dog

337
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:26,742
He's like my son. Remember

338
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,075
Sit

339
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,752
l'm from Patiala, Punjab.
- Really?

340
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,414
My uncle was in the army

341
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:44,756
Once l took his gun and ran to the
fields, for some shooting practice

342
00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:48,757
Enraged, he snatched the gun...

343
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,626
and said, lt's an official gun

344
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:55,902
l was so peeVed that
l joined the army...

345
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,433
and l got my own gun

346
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:04,644
A few years later, war for
independence broke out in Goa

347
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,646
They posted me here in Goa

348
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:13,784
After the war, l settled
here with my family

349
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:18,129
Luckily, l loVe Goa

350
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:20,522
Luckily, l loVe Goa too

351
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:26,465
What do they call a chicken
in Punjab? - Kukdi

352
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:31,136
And a girl?
- Kudi

353
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:45,150
Those medals... did
you win them, sir?

354
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:49,818
My wife wasn't in the army, so
obViously they belong to me

355
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,830
Actually sir, your personality
unsettles me

356
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:58,834
That's why l'm talking like a fool

357
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:01,172
NeVer mind

358
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:09,508
And that Chinese pot
near the medals...

359
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:14,519
looks like an antique piece,
does it contain Chinese tea?

360
00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:17,852
lt contains my late mother's ashes

361
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,852
lt giVes me a feeling that l always
haVe her blessings with me

362
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:29,858
You dearly loVed your mother.
- l still loVe her

363
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:34,529
We tried really hard to saVe her

364
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:39,207
But what God wills...
- Let it be, Papa

365
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,212
Let's eat

366
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:47,217
Why did you haVe to bring that, son?

367
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:51,215
lt's my first time here.
- Let me uncork it

368
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:54,219
No, sir. Let me haVe the pleasure

369
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,631
And to you, beautiful lady

370
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:52,948
What haVe you done?

371
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,966
What haVe you done?

372
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:14,633
Shut up! lt all happened
because of you

373
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:18,967
Because of me, really? - You asked
me to uncork it at one go

374
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:22,307
l asked you to open the bottle,
not to break the pot of ashes

375
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:27,312
Good that the pot broke. At least
it has set his mother's soul free

376
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:32,580
l think the colonel is insane

377
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,991
Oh no... he's a Very intelligent man

378
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:39,324
lntelligent, my foot! Mother's ashes
ought to be immersed in the Ganges

379
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,992
No one keeps it at home.
NeVer in a pot, at that!

380
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:46,001
lt's okay, we'll talk later.
- Let me clear this now

381
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,004
Please try to see it
from my point of View

382
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:52,342
Why don't you try to see
it from my point of View?

383
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,339
HaVe you seen the colonel?

384
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:58,683
He looks as if he grew
old twenty years back

385
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:01,681
Look at his wife... as if she
has just stepped into youth

386
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:06,681
Tell me, from what angle does Rani
look like the colonel's daughter?

387
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:09,694
Yeah, Tommy does appear
to be his son

388
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:14,029
l can't explain that. You should
be asking the person concerned

389
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:15,764
Who?
- Rani

390
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:18,162
The colonel would neVer
reVeal the secret to Rani

391
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:23,698
The other day l spared you because
it was only a mistake

392
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:26,709
But today, you intentionally...

393
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,375
You hit my Papa on his face...

394
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:34,909
still l forgaVe you. But today
you'Ve hurt me in the heart

395
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,712
Can you explain?
- Rani...

396
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,191
Did you intend to say that
my father didn't sire me?

397
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,792
No!
- That my mother is wanton?

398
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,056
No!

399
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:49,728
lt was tough conVincing myself
that you are a nice person

400
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:54,069
And you, priest! l'm
really surprised

401
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,932
How could you consider such
a lowly man a friend?

402
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:01,746
Let alone respect someone, he
hardly knows what respect means

403
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:05,740
See? She is hurt because of you!
- Because of me, really?

404
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:08,810
l was only kidding. When you knew
Rani was standing behind me...

405
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,878
why didn't you tell me?
- l was telling you...

406
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:14,084
see from my point of View!
- Your language is too tough for me

407
00:38:16,095 --> 00:38:19,428
For all the mistakes you commit,
you pass the buck on to me! God!

408
00:38:19,832 --> 00:38:21,823
Ball?

409
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:28,103
What happened?
- A flat tyre?

410
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,765
No, someone got thrashed

411
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,101
Who?
- Papa!

412
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,442
Granny!

413
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,456
l'm ill-fated, it's writ. Reading my
horoscope won't turn things around

414
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:48,459
Just checking what's worse
is in store. - What...?

415
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:52,463
Your past was your golden period.
- Golden period, really?

416
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:56,968
Yes. Your future is worse.
- Worse than what l'm going through?

417
00:38:57,036 --> 00:39:01,473
Jupiter's place is right up here.
Yours is down in hell

418
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,136
The Moon's place is in the 7th
house. Yours is homeless

419
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,475
MoreoVer, Saturn is about to enter

420
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:12,807
You said, Saturn left me last week.
- And it did

421
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:17,149
Usually, once it leaVes, Saturn
neVer returns for another seVen years

422
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:20,817
Not in your case. Saturn is about
to re-enter in a few seconds time

423
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:41,842
Right, anything is possible with
me. - Saturn is on its way

424
00:39:41,914 --> 00:39:43,506
And it will wreck me.
- This Saturn is going to...

425
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:48,519
change your life and destiny.
lt will come like a tempest

426
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:54,855
What say, dude?

427
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:00,525
He's going to steal
the princess away

428
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:15,540
As per my calculations, it will
stay with you in your room...

429
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:18,879
and knock at Rani's door

430
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,876
Hello uncle

431
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:27,890
Hello, l say. Remember me?

432
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:33,058
l'm your distant relatiVe. Sunny

433
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:36,895
For miles away, uncle has
no relatiVes. Go away

434
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:40,564
Uncle, your serVant is ill-mannered.
Ask him not to mess with me

435
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:44,569
Why is he so quiet? - Not that
he is glad to remain quiet

436
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:45,905
He's ailing.
- Shut up

437
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:48,572
Uncle, l'm Sunny. Mr Khurana's son

438
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:52,583
Who... Khur... ana? Who Khurana?
- Back in Gurudaspur...

439
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:54,585
this road in front of your house...
- There's one..

440
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,086
..in front of eVery house

441
00:40:56,155 --> 00:41:00,592
it turns around the corner.
- They all turn. No road is straight

442
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,594
And where does it go? Straight
to his friend's house

443
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:06,261
Friend? Who?
- Mr Khosla

444
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:09,926
He just said Khurana!
- How smart! You caught me

445
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:13,597
l was only testing you. Know what?
When l asked your address...

446
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:18,609
eVeryone said there's only one
decent and honest boy in Goa. You

447
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,611
Boy...? What a fraud!

448
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:25,940
Tell me honestly, why are you here?
- Well, l...

449
00:41:26,018 --> 00:41:27,610
want to hire a room

450
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:33,618
No, he says. Go away

451
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:39,954
No way, get lost, he says.
Look, he's pissed off

452
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:47,638
Now tell me.
- Stay here

453
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:52,643
Well, now that you are dumb,
you won't pick up a fight

454
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:57,648
So let's go to my relatiVe's place.
- RelatiVe, aunt? Then who am l?

455
00:41:57,716 --> 00:42:00,651
Who are you?
- Sunny

456
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:05,150
Not Sunny, he's Shani (Saturn).
- Shut up, dude

457
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:07,658
Uncle, for my sake don't tell
aunt where l come from

458
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:10,661
Well, uncle himself doesn't
know where he comes from

459
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:13,658
Aunt, l'm a tenant here.
Here's 10,000 bucks

460
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:17,668
Take another 9,999... take care

461
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:21,666
l'm a bit tired. Show
me to my room, please

462
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,675
Let me see you off at the
next street. - Ass!..

463
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:27,678
..Hold this. Bring it upstairs

464
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:40,020
Oldie's got a nice room.
- Yes

465
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:42,190
But we are sharing it

466
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:52,367
What are you staring at me for? -
Why share? We'll be exchanging beds

467
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,031
We'll also sleep in the
same bed, as brothers...

468
00:42:55,107 --> 00:42:57,371
Don't touch me. l don't like it

469
00:42:57,442 --> 00:43:01,378
Like the rent, we share the room
too. This side is yours, that's mine

470
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:03,380
All right, giVe me a hug.
- No!

471
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:07,714
l don't hug men.
- Really? How Vain

472
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:09,378
WhateVer.
- Okay listen...

473
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:14,721
why don't you take your God there?
- God doesn't belong to one person

474
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:18,729
God belongs to eVeryone. And
listen, we'Ve shared the room...

475
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:23,734
not the walls. God's not moVing.
- And where do l stick my posters?

476
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:26,737
WhereVer you wish. God's not moVing

477
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:29,740
l got an idea. Stick them
up in the bathroom

478
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:33,073
Why do you get so angry?
- Am l angry?

479
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:37,241
Now! EVen while you are talking.
- Yeah, where am l angry?

480
00:43:37,316 --> 00:43:40,251
Look, the room's got hot.
Need to open the window

481
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,253
Don't open the window!

482
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:44,755
Why?
- She comes there

483
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:50,755
l need to check her out then.
Since l pay half the rent...

484
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,093
l'll open half the window

485
00:43:53,165 --> 00:43:56,760
You're on my half, let me embrace
you! - Don't piss me off!

486
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:01,265
l tried my best to keep him off

487
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,790
What a sight!

488
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:26,792
Mr Sameer deliberately kept
the door shut to keep me off

489
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:30,801
But smelling a scent from
a distance is my forte

490
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,802
What a dish!
- Don't you say that!

491
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:41,812
Does she mean anything to you?
- No. But decent folks stay here

492
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,815
By the way she is a
nice and decent girl

493
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:47,818
And she's a colonel's daughter.
He will shoot you if he hears you

494
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:51,822
For a beauty like her, l'd
take a bullet on my chest

495
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,824
On my chest

496
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,821
ldiotic!

497
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:00,326
Don't you jump!
- Why not?

498
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:02,833
You are in bad times, as it is

499
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:06,166
For all your good intentions, you
might fall on top of the colonel

500
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:13,338
He's going in.
- No. As per my calculations...

501
00:45:13,412 --> 00:45:15,346
Tommy will haVe a go at him

502
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:30,190
He's gone inside. - Not to worry.
My calculations say...

503
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:32,355
the colonel will kick
him out in a minute

504
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:35,189
What's your name?
- Tommy

505
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:39,864
Nice name. My respects, uncle

506
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:41,872
Who are you?

507
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,876
What do you want?
- l just wanted to meet you, uncle

508
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:48,879
l'm new here. l'm told
that you are the only..

509
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:50,881
..decent and honest boy around

510
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:52,883
Boy?
- What else? Look at you

511
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:56,887
You can put any young man
to shame. Besides...

512
00:45:57,222 --> 00:46:01,556
hang on. What's that in your ears?
And what's around your neck, bro?

513
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:05,892
Don't ask me. My blood boils
when l think of it

514
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:07,898
Screwed my calculations!

515
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:13,227
What are you doing?
- Worry not. l haVe fixed many bones

516
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:15,899
And it's only a sprain. Look
straight... here goes

517
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:21,906
What say? How do you feel?

518
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,909
Be honest.
- Feels nice

519
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:30,915
Where are you staying? - At your
neighbour Mr Duggal's place

520
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:35,255
The one who broke my
neck also stays there

521
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:38,922
Don't be angry. l'm his roommate.
l know he's ill-mannered...

522
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:42,262
and he'll surely change, but this
is not how one should treat an elder

523
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:44,928
A ball hit me, by mistake

524
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:48,939
Darling, what's happening? When
did you employ a masseur?

525
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:51,942
From today.
- Oh no, he's not a masseur, darling

526
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,945
Sunny is a nice boy

527
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:57,948
He's Mr Duggal's tenant.
- l see

528
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:01,611
Tell you something, massage
is not actually done indoors

529
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:05,952
A garden, or an open terrace
would be just amazing

530
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:08,618
We haVe a terrace garden.
- Don't tell me. Really? Where?

531
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,957
Upstairs.
- Can l check it out?

532
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:12,963
Sure

533
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:25,970
Did he swallow something?

534
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:31,976
He's dancing ... adVancing
towards the girl

535
00:47:52,337 --> 00:47:57,331
Damn... your loVe-story began here
and ended in the colonel's ears

536
00:47:57,409 --> 00:48:02,005
He began it by shaking hands, and
it's going to end in honeymoon

537
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:10,521
Sir, do something. Please
do something to me

538
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:14,025
What do l do to you?
- l want a baby

539
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:17,027
GiVe me a baby, please!
- What...?

540
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:21,696
What are you doing here?
- You! What are you doing here?

541
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:24,030
You know her?
- She is my wife

542
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:26,696
Don't you haVe children?
- Yes, two in fact

543
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:30,366
Boys, both. And you know
what these boys are like

544
00:48:30,442 --> 00:48:34,037
l want a daughter.
- So why me? Ask him

545
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,041
Listen... please

546
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:41,051
What?
- He promised to giVe me a daughter

547
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,386
After duty hours, he used to
get me sweets and flowers...

548
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:50,053
and shut the doors and windows

549
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:52,722
But eVer since you put him
on the night shift...

550
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:56,062
the doors and windows only shut to
allow him get a good day's sleep

551
00:48:56,134 --> 00:49:00,571
lt's a mistake but a
mistake is a mistake

552
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,075
You must also haVe committed
a mistake, by mistake, no?

553
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:09,573
Yes, you are right

554
00:49:09,648 --> 00:49:12,742
And l can understand your problem.
l'll definitely help you

555
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:14,409
Hang on

556
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:23,093
From tomorrow, you will buy her
sweets and flowers eVery day

557
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,099
What the...? Get up

558
00:49:31,169 --> 00:49:33,103
Was l wrong?

559
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:06,460
500 for grandma, 500 for
my sister's studies...

560
00:50:06,538 --> 00:50:10,133
500 for her marriage, and 500...

561
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,146
For my roommate

562
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:20,150
What a sight!

563
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:24,649
lt's worth paying a hundred
thousand in rent

564
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:29,824
What are you upto?
- Watching the colonel

565
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:32,829
Really?
- Wanna check?

566
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:40,164
That's his daughter

567
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,671
Do they look alike?

568
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:53,183
No way! And what are you drinking?

569
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:56,186
Water.
- Really?

570
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:59,189
l swear by you.
- l see. Go on

571
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:04,194
Let me smell it... is this water?

572
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:08,198
Fenny is Goa's speciality. lt's
nothing but cashewnut juice

573
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:10,200
l see. l'll juice you!

574
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:14,204
l'm going to tell Mr Duggal
that you are boozing here

575
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:16,536
Listen...

576
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:19,202
Don't touch me.
- l won't booze anymore, promise

577
00:51:19,277 --> 00:51:22,212
All right.
- One last swig

578
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,213
What's that?
- Oh, those?

579
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:33,223
Your God's on my wall, so l glued
my goddesses to your wall

580
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:36,721
So why get angry?
- l'm not angry

581
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:38,558
You are peeVed.
- l'm not

582
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,222
Relax... easy

583
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:43,227
You feel like abusing me.
- Not at all

584
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:47,237
l know, you want to tell
me something. - No

585
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:49,569
You want to hit me. Go on, hit me.
- No

586
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:51,233
C'mon, hit me.
- Oh no

587
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:57,742
Why don't you go to your half?
- Okay. Peace

588
00:51:57,816 --> 00:51:59,249
Peace

589
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:07,251
What was that? Earthquake?

590
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:14,264
Mr Duggal, where did you pick that
roommate from? He boozes, and...

591
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:22,262
watches Rani through his binoculars,
You must go and inform the colonel

592
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:26,941
Oh, why would you inform the
colonel? The ass has stuffed you with money

593
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:29,275
Rather l'll go and inform him

594
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:34,278
Mr Duggal... looks like
he's deaf today

595
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,287
He's deaf

596
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:01,311
Young man, my neck feels better now

597
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:04,644
Hello aunt.
- Do something to my ear

598
00:53:04,816 --> 00:53:10,812
Let me fix your neck first.
Fixing the ear is no big deal

599
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:13,653
lt will be all right. Where's Rani?

600
00:53:13,725 --> 00:53:19,322
See, Rama? Though they share the
same room, they are poles apart

601
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:21,325
That swine injures me,
and the other...

602
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:26,336
the decent one, comes home eVeryday
to giVe me a massage

603
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:31,341
Hush, Tommy

604
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:35,345
Sameer is not around, then
who is Tommy barking at?

605
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:38,348
Dogs haVe a Very sharp memory, uncle

606
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:41,351
Tommy must be barking
at Sameer's thoughts

607
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,353
Where's Rani?

608
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:48,352
Bloody dog!

609
00:53:51,029 --> 00:53:52,690
Guess what?

610
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:57,361
You look so happy. What giVes?
- This year, the All lndia...

611
00:53:57,435 --> 00:54:00,029
Fashion Designers' competition
is going to be held in Goa

612
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:03,369
The designs l had sent
haVe been approVed

613
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:05,375
And l'm participating this year!

614
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:16,876
Papa, l got to pay the entry fees
within two days. Only 20,000 Rupees

615
00:54:16,955 --> 00:54:20,721
Let her haVe it. l'll return
eVery cent after marriage

616
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:26,059
20,000? No dear, l can't
afford that much

617
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:30,396
Please Papa, for my sake. lt's
Very important for my career

618
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:34,404
Golden opportunities don't knock
twice. GiVe her the money

619
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:37,407
Where's the money, son?
l'm a retired colonel

620
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:40,740
We manage with my pension.
Where do l get 20,000 from?

621
00:54:40,812 --> 00:54:42,404
Selfish father

622
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,745
You upset her

623
00:54:51,923 --> 00:54:57,418
Expenses haVe already risen this
month. 1 2,000 for the hearing aid

624
00:54:57,495 --> 00:55:01,932
3000 for my neck-collar. Where
do l get 20,000 from?

625
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,764
Why won't you giVe her? You
still haVe your eyes...

626
00:55:04,836 --> 00:55:07,430
heart, lungs and kidneys intact.
l'll puncture them all

627
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:11,100
Granny you ask me not to lose
my temper! Tell me, why not?

628
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:14,110
The colonel won't giVe Rani the
money. Who will help the poor girl?

629
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:16,442
l wish l could strangle his...

630
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,445
Granny, l got a solid idea

631
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:23,453
Postpone your eye surgery.
Let's first help..

632
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:26,456
..Rani realise her dream. What say?

633
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:29,459
Besides, granny, Lord Krishna's
birthday is approaching

634
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:33,463
The Lord is here! Be careful
with your pots, lassies...

635
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:38,462
So much!

636
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:46,801
Let it go! That's not a biscuit

637
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:52,544
Bloody dog! Let it go

638
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,481
What's that?

639
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:20,840
Dearest Rani, l know you want to
become a famous fashion designer

640
00:56:20,912 --> 00:56:22,903
l'm sending you money...

641

to help you cross the first hurdle
in the path of your progress

642
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:29,512
Not a faVour, just consider
it as a gift from a friend

643
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,525
And, if you win the show...

644
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:38,528
you will be happy, but my
happiness will be greater than yours

645
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:43,590

this small help. Not eVen thanks

646
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:48,134
Your well-wisher

647
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:33,581
How long will you conceal
your youth, my loVe?

648
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:44,094
How long will you torment
the bachelors?

649
00:57:44,162 --> 00:57:49,600
Someday you are going to
become someone's bride

650
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:52,932
Will you marry me?

651
00:57:53,004 --> 00:57:56,770
Will you marry me?

652
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:11,175

l'll make the Sun bow
before you, l swear

656
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:31,700
Someday you will go crazy for me

657
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:34,704
Will you marry me?

658
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:39,038
Will you marry me?

659
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:28,756
The day l come as a bridegroom,

660
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:32,762

a palanquin, l swear

Will you marry me?

665
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:56,946
Will you marry me?

666
01:00:57,021 --> 01:01:00,787
How long will you conceal
your youth, my loVe?

667
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:04,316
How long will you torment
the bachelors?

668
01:01:04,395 --> 01:01:09,799
Someday you are going to
become someone's bride

669
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:13,200
Will you marry me?

670
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:17,138
Will you marry me?

671
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:28,818
l will marry you

672
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:32,822
l will marry you

673
01:02:26,944 --> 01:02:29,936
You neVer told me you
play the guitar so well

674
01:02:30,948 --> 01:02:33,212
What a reVelation!

675
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:40,617
All those lessons in guitar
seem worthwhile today

676
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:44,894
HaVe a laddoo.
- What's the occasion?

677
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:48,898
l told you l want to participate in
the fashion designing competition

678
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:52,231
l paid the entry fees today.
- Really?

679
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,904
l'll take two laddoos.
- Why?

680
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:57,907
One for me and one for my God

681
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:03,242
Go ahead

682
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:06,910
Bye

683
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:18,256
What a shame

684
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:23,096
Bloody untuned drum! Did your father
eVer play a guitar? GiVe it here

685
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,533
Papa is... a businessman in lndore

686
01:03:26,604 --> 01:03:29,095
A businessman, really? And you
were playing the guitar, eh?

687
01:03:29,173 --> 01:03:32,108
When did l say that? The poor
girl thought it was me

688
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:35,942
And you were tongue-tied,
no? You could only grin

689
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:40,450
Couldn't you say that it was me?
- Am l nuts to tell her that...

690
01:03:40,518 --> 01:03:45,285
it wasn't me but it was our master
Sameer Malhotra who was playing?

691
01:03:45,456 --> 01:03:47,356
She was so impressed, dude.

692
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:50,291
And she eVen saw the posters
of your goddesses

693
01:03:50,361 --> 01:03:52,955
Know what she said? What a shame

694
01:03:56,033 --> 01:04:01,027
You're in my half. l'll kiss anything
that comes my way, l told you

695
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:07,375
The priest said it right! You are
not Sunny but Shani (Saturn)

696
01:04:07,645 --> 01:04:10,136
Stay away from me

697
01:04:18,055 --> 01:04:22,992
l got my temper under control!
l wish l could tear you apart

698
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:28,154
He's coming.
- Sunny, haVen't l reminded you...

699
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:31,998
to pay the rent?
- l'Ve mailed the address to Daddy

700
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:35,004
He should be sending the money.
- lf it doesn't arriVe this time...

701
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:38,006
you will haVe to leaVe. Remember.
- Uncle...

702
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:43,172
did l eVer harass you? HaVe
l eVer troubled you, aunt?

703
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:46,011
Then why don't you clean
the railings? Look...

704
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:50,019
Pay the rent, we'll clean
it daily. What...?

705
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:52,681
He's gone.
- You should'Ve told me

706
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:55,354
ls Mr Duggal in?
- Yes. So?

707
01:04:55,426 --> 01:04:57,690
There's a letter for Sunny

708
01:04:58,262 --> 01:05:01,425
Sunny stays here, right?
- Yes, dammit! Go in

709
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:08,032
Mr Duggal, there's
a letter for Sunny

710
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:12,041
Hey, where are you going?

711
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:14,703
GiVe me.
- Two? Two letters?

712
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:18,373
Whom is the second letter for?
- Only one! l asked him to giVe it

713
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:21,111
So take it and driVe him out.
- l'm going

714
01:05:21,185 --> 01:05:24,712
MoVe it. Do you fancy eating and
sleeping here? Has he left?

715
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:30,116
Okay, read the letter.
- lt's for Sunny

716
01:05:30,194 --> 01:05:33,459
Why should we read it?
- Why not? He's our tenant

717
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,054
We must know what type
of a person he is..

718
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:36,656
..what kind of people write to him

719
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,065
Read

720
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:41,070
Go on

721
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:45,074
Let me open it.
- ls it made of steel?

722
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:48,669
Dearest son, Sunny, eVer since
you haVe left, l'Ve been worried

723
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:53,740
Your planes are grieVing. There's
no one to pilot them

724
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:59,084
son, without you, what use are six
bunglows and eight factories to me?

725
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:02,091
l hear, you are staying
with a beggar

726
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:06,095
lf you wish to extend
your stay, reVert back

727
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:09,257
l'll present a huge bungalow
to your landlord

728
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:11,426
Your Papa

729
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:18,767
l must leaVe now.
- Where are you going, son?

730
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:23,272
Papa hasn't sent money, not eVen
a letter. How can l stay here?

731
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:27,181
Did l really offend you? Do
you haVe a problem here, son?

732
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:30,113
No, no.
- All l haVe on me is a fake coin

733
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:32,121
You guys snatched 10,000
bucks from me..

734
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:34,180
..and you ask me if l haVe a problem

735
01:06:34,258 --> 01:06:38,194
10,000? Just ask me, and l'll
giVe you 10,000 eVery day

736
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:41,126
But please don't quit this place

737
01:06:41,632 --> 01:06:45,534
From now on, we'll cook for you.
l'll do your laundry too

738
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:48,537
Let go of my hand, will you? And
who will wear my underwear?

739
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:51,540
l will do that. l'll
eVen giVe you a bath

740
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:55,305
But don't eVer leaVe this place.
- Don't eVer go, son

741
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:57,472
Tell you something...

742
01:06:57,548 --> 01:07:01,644
somebody has rightly said,
if you want true loVe...

743
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:06,884
stay in a poor man's shanty

744
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:12,661
Put the binoculars down! Else,
l'll inform the Colonel

745
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:14,163
Go ahead

746
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:18,165
Are you boozing? l told you
not to drink, didn't l?

747
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:21,170
Wait till l tell Mr Duggal.
- Go ahead and tell him

748
01:07:21,672 --> 01:07:24,664
You wait here! Mr Duggal!

749
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:28,672
Who the hell...?

750
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:35,776
Are you boozing here?
- D'you want me to sit on the roof?

751
01:07:35,853 --> 01:07:38,344
What if l fall down?
- You're drunk

752
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:42,188
l can't...! You are blind now,
l'll talk to you in the morning

753
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:45,194
Makes no difference. l'Ve
been blind since morning

754
01:07:45,262 --> 01:07:50,359
Don't mind the poor fellow.
Here, grab your bottle

755
01:07:51,268 --> 01:07:56,205
Here you are.
- See? That's a tenant

756
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:59,208
And you neVer treated
me eVen to a cup of tea

757
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:04,211
He's helping me liVe it up, you
know. - Where is he taking you?

758
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:08,217
Oh, l forgot! We got to
meet Bijli! Let's go

759
01:08:08,285 --> 01:08:11,880
Come on. Not there... this way

760
01:08:11,955 --> 01:08:15,891
Don't go. lt's a bad habit.
- Don't go, my foot!

761
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:21,230
Clear the litter, will you?
- He tells me to clear the litter

762
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:24,825
Don't do it. lt's my house.
Who is he to giVe orders?

763
01:08:24,902 --> 01:08:28,963
l'm going to throw it away!
- Pick it up and throw it outside!

764
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:30,404
Here goes!

765
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:33,901
Bloody...!

766
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:36,745
Who got smashed?
- Who?

767
01:08:36,814 --> 01:08:39,248
The Colonel

768
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:43,252
Who hit him?
- Brother Sameer

769
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:49,259
Our friendly neighbourhood hunter.
He's hunted many a colonel down!

770
01:08:50,427 --> 01:08:53,260
You are in my half, let me kiss you

771
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,423
Go, neck Bijli!

772
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:58,332
Rani, once again, forgiVe me

773
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:01,927
Neck Bijli, you will be forgiVen

774
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:10,439
The thorn

775
01:09:18,355 --> 01:09:21,449
Oh, the piercing thorn

776
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:23,618
Come, my loVe

777
01:09:23,694 --> 01:09:26,891
Behind your bungalow,
under the berry tree...

778
01:09:26,964 --> 01:09:30,297
my loVe...

779
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:37,637
a thorn pierced me

780
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:51,320
Now that you are in trouble,
you wonder...

781
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:54,482
why you couldn't stay without me

782
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:58,324
Your friends were right
when they said...

783
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:00,920
you will be trapped someday

784
01:10:00,998 --> 01:10:02,659
Get that?

785
01:10:02,733 --> 01:10:04,667
l'm sorry...

786
01:10:04,735 --> 01:10:06,930
let bygones be bygones

787
01:10:07,004 --> 01:10:10,337
SaVe my heart this time, my loVe

788
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:15,936
Your clothes are skimpy... eVen
the blindman says, show it to me

789
01:10:16,013 --> 01:10:17,503
Show it

790
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:21,517
Get lost

791
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:25,681
MoVe it

792
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:48,769
Another 15,000? What for?
l haVe already paid 20,000

793
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:51,712
That was entry fees. 15,000
is entertainment tax

794
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:56,385
You should'Ve told me before. The
show is at hand, how can l raise...?

795
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:59,388
Entertainment tax is a goVernment
policy. EVerybody knows that

796
01:11:00,724 --> 01:11:04,387
lf you don't pay by eVening, you
cannot do the show tomorrow

797
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:08,397
Why can't she? She is my Rani

798
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:18,407
Don't weep... please don't

799
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:19,806
You will do the show

800
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:23,139
l promise you, you will do the show

801
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:31,011
Sis, l just heard that
the goVernment says...

802
01:11:31,088 --> 01:11:35,752
it's illegal to get a girl
married before she turns 21

803
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:41,429
Which means you haVe three
more years to go, sis

804
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:45,161
And your sister-in-law
has only three days

805
01:11:45,235 --> 01:11:49,831
Why don't you concentrate on your
studies for the next three years?

806
01:11:52,509 --> 01:11:54,841
Shall l break the pot?

807
01:11:57,714 --> 01:12:01,172
Thank you, dear sister

808
01:12:08,525 --> 01:12:12,461
Still short of 5000! l'm
seriously stressed now

809
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:17,464
You got to help me now, God

810
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:30,479
That was for my sister's studies!
You could'Ve broken Your piggy bank

811
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:13,241
Come here... do you know her?

812
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:19,082
Hot, eh...? You're throwing
kisses at your sisters...?

813
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:27,755
l can't figure out what to say

814
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:32,931
Many people are responsible
for this dream come true

815
01:14:33,003 --> 01:14:38,942
But there is someone l
want to specially thank

816
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:44,204
l don't know his name,
nor do l recognise him

817
01:14:44,281 --> 01:14:49,218
l'Ve neVer met him, but he's
the anonymous friend...

818
01:14:49,686 --> 01:14:54,953
who helped me out when l
needed support the most

819
01:14:55,692 --> 01:15:01,130
He calls himself my well-wisher

820
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:06,032
l appeal to him. if
you can hear me...

821
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:11,631
please come and meet me. l'd
like to personally thank you

822
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:42,671
My dear God, grandma always says that
a princess will come into my life

823
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:45,069
But not eVen a maid-serVant
has come into it till today

824
01:15:45,141 --> 01:15:48,668
But l feel today as if the
Princess will surely come

825
01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:52,681
God, don't mess up things.
l loVe her too much

826
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:56,185
l'd haVe called her home, but
Sunny's around, you see?

827
01:15:56,253 --> 01:15:59,279
So l'Ve called her here.
Nothing wrong, is there?

828
01:15:59,356 --> 01:16:03,690
Nothing wrong. EVerything
you'Ve done is good

829
01:16:04,294 --> 01:16:08,697
l'Ve heard it all Sameer. That
which you tried to say...

830
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:13,097
and also that which you didn't say.
You did so much for me...

831
01:16:13,203 --> 01:16:16,434
and didn't eVen let me know?

832
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:42,726
You shall pine at heart, my loVe...

833
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:54,072
by God, you too shall fall in loVe

834
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:05,083
At heart, l shall desire you too

835
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:16,424
by God, l hope l fall in loVe too

836
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:56,969
You're charming...

837
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,806
you're my loVe, you're my romance

838
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:06,406
l'm bowled oVer... yes,
l acknowledge that

839
01:18:06,483 --> 01:18:12,319
l know, your loVe
is full of mischief

840
01:18:12,389 --> 01:18:17,827
But l can't help it, my
heart just won't agree

841
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:23,161
How l wish l rule your heart

842
01:18:23,233 --> 01:18:29,001
By God, may you fall in loVe too

843
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:06,869
They call me beautiful, they
call me the proud one...

844
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:13,280
and you'Ve gone crazy; you haVe
no control oVer your heart

845
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:19,219
l'm no less crazy. l'm
not conceding defeat

846
01:19:19,289 --> 01:19:25,057
l'm here to steal your heart,
and steal it, l will

847
01:19:25,128 --> 01:19:30,293
How l wish l begin to trust you

848
01:19:30,366 --> 01:19:35,895
By God, l hope l fall in loVe too

849
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:41,501
May you begin to pine at heart

850
01:19:57,994 --> 01:20:04,092
By God, may you fall in loVe too

851
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:18,447
God! What a sweet dream! Make
it come true, please!

852
01:20:24,621 --> 01:20:25,679
Here she is!

853
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:33,693
By the way, You'Ve done a great
job in making her, God

854
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:47,367
Sunny...? Can't be!

855
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:53,641
God, why's he...?

856
01:20:58,054 --> 01:21:00,648
Sunny! You...?

857
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:03,491
Which means you're
the well-wisher...?

858
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:07,391
l didn't want to say
it. But l knew...

859
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:10,990
you'd get to know some day.
- But...

860
01:21:16,506 --> 01:21:21,000
Stop necking him! GiVe me the hug!

861
01:21:21,077 --> 01:21:23,341
He's a fraud!

862
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:28,676
You... my...?

863
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:36,081
Rani!

864
01:22:03,386 --> 01:22:07,789
Rani! Don't go with him!
l'm me... l'm not him!

865
01:22:36,352 --> 01:22:39,253
l'm the one she loVes.
LeaVe her alone!

866
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:55,831
God! Make him see reason! Let
go of her cheek, you scoundrel!

867
01:23:01,444 --> 01:23:04,845
Rani, l'm the real one! l'm not him!

868
01:23:33,209 --> 01:23:35,200
Out of the way, Colonel!

869
01:23:36,212 --> 01:23:37,645
Step aside!

870
01:23:37,714 --> 01:23:40,148
What...? Step up...?

871
01:23:40,483 --> 01:23:42,678
Out of the way!

872
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:45,210
Out!

873
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:52,884
What happened...? Who got smashed?

874
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:56,665
The Colonel got smashed!

875
01:23:55,695 --> 01:24:00,530
Sunny, don't be shy, haVe
some more. Eat to your fill

876
01:24:00,967 --> 01:24:03,527
The milk reminds me of home

877
01:24:04,771 --> 01:24:06,864
This is your home too.
- Absolutely

878
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:10,873
We can't eVer forget what
you haVe done for our Rani

879
01:24:10,944 --> 01:24:15,108
And you didn't eVen let me know.
- Ma always says...

880
01:24:15,548 --> 01:24:17,880
your left hand must not know
what your right hand does

881
01:24:18,184 --> 01:24:23,451
Hear that? Such lofty ideals! -
Pickles! l don't know where they are

882
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:27,791
Not pickles, ideals, darling.
- ldeals, l see

883
01:24:28,728 --> 01:24:33,722
They are poles apart. One is an
angel while the other is a demon

884
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,993
The more distance l keep from him,
the closer he gets to deal a blow

885
01:24:38,671 --> 01:24:42,402
With a football, when l'm at home.
With a bottle, when l'm outside

886
01:24:42,609 --> 01:24:43,940
When l'm walking on the footpath..

887
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:45,409
..he calls me in the
middle of the road...

888
01:24:45,478 --> 01:24:48,003
and rams his motorbike into me

889
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:54,075
Be careful. Say it again, Sameer

890
01:24:54,954 --> 01:24:57,422
Colonel, l'm sorry, l'Ve
been a bloody fool

891
01:24:57,490 --> 01:24:59,424
Accept these flowers
and please forgiVe me

892
01:24:59,626 --> 01:25:01,924
Okay, l forgiVe you

893
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:05,921
Where does the Colonel get
his Voice? - God knows

894
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,425
Where did he transpire from?

895
01:25:08,768 --> 01:25:11,430
Wake up! We are here

896
01:25:12,605 --> 01:25:15,597
Who is this sleepy character?
- A security guard

897
01:25:15,675 --> 01:25:17,973
He tried to mess with me, l put him
on a three-months' night shift

898
01:25:18,778 --> 01:25:21,941
No wonder he brings his wife
to make an appeal to you

899
01:25:23,049 --> 01:25:24,448
Uncle!

900
01:25:26,986 --> 01:25:29,716
How are you, dear niece?
- You'Ve pulled down!

901
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:32,451
Can't tell you what
l'Ve been through

902
01:25:33,626 --> 01:25:38,620
Rani's uncle? This man could'Ve
been your Cupid...

903
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:40,791
but you'Ve already plunged
him into the darkness

904
01:25:42,669 --> 01:25:46,127
Brother-in-law, you are wrapped all
oVer in bandages? What happened?

905
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,869
Sunny, he is my wife's brother

906
01:25:49,642 --> 01:25:53,635
Swine! Where haVe you
been all this while?

907
01:25:54,747 --> 01:25:57,648
Brother, l'm cross with you. We
liVe in the same city, yet...

908
01:25:57,717 --> 01:26:00,652
you haVen't been here for months.
- What city, sister?

909
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:04,486
l don't eVen get to see my wife.
- What does that mean?

910
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:08,492
This new manager, the swine, has put
me on night shift since two months

911
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:11,824
He sleeps during the daytime, and
stays up like an owl during the nights

912
01:26:11,898 --> 01:26:14,298
He's suffering from constipation
and acidity

913
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,491
Look at the dark circles
below his eyes

914
01:26:17,303 --> 01:26:20,500
That's fine, but who's
that scoundrel?

915
01:26:20,673 --> 01:26:24,769
That's fine, but who are you?
- Uncle, he is Sunny. Our neighbour

916
01:26:24,844 --> 01:26:27,677
l see. Glad to meet you.
- We'll meet later

917
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:31,841
You were talking about some manager...
- Don't eVen mention the swine

918
01:26:32,685 --> 01:26:36,314
What has he done?
- He's made life miserable for me

919
01:26:36,689 --> 01:26:38,520
What's his name?
- Bloody Saturn! Shut up

920
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:40,524
Sameer

921
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:45,024
Uncle, our Sameer. Your neighbour.
My roommate Sameer

922
01:26:45,131 --> 01:26:46,860
What...? Sameer stays
in the neighbourhood?

923
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,692
Which beggar in the neighbourhood?
- Not a beggar, it's Sameer

924
01:26:50,803 --> 01:26:53,203
One who wrecked you!
Now he's after him

925
01:26:55,975 --> 01:26:58,876
That swine is after my whole family

926
01:27:00,213 --> 01:27:02,204
Time's not faVourable, Sameer

927
01:27:03,149 --> 01:27:07,984
Forget the flowers, forget the
colonel, placate the uncle

928
01:27:08,755 --> 01:27:10,552
Uncle...

929
01:27:17,063 --> 01:27:19,759
The tables haVe turned.
Now watch the fun

930
01:27:22,168 --> 01:27:26,832
Uncle, aunt... l'Ve got
some presents for you

931
01:27:27,774 --> 01:27:29,571
Skirt and blouse for you

932
01:27:30,376 --> 01:27:32,571
Bush shirt for you, uncle

933
01:27:33,112 --> 01:27:34,841
Sweets for the kids

934
01:27:35,114 --> 01:27:37,742
Also some fruits for the two of you

935
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:41,852
l hope you don't expect these
things to bear fruit?

936
01:27:41,921 --> 01:27:45,379
Oh no, of course not

937
01:27:46,259 --> 01:27:50,753
Uncle, if by any chance l haVe
uttered something wrong...

938
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:56,928
please forgiVe me. l'Ve realised
that l'Ve been unfair to you

939
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:01,262
You are off the night shift.
- What...?

940
01:28:01,774 --> 01:28:03,605
Then how about tonight...?
- Sure

941
01:28:06,946 --> 01:28:09,938
Son-in-law...
- Son-in-law...?

942
01:28:10,783 --> 01:28:14,879
Son-in-law, indeed. The other day
when l asked you about Rani...

943
01:28:14,954 --> 01:28:19,414
had you answered me, you'd
haVe been married by now

944
01:28:19,959 --> 01:28:21,950
And l would be your uncle

945
01:28:22,829 --> 01:28:25,627
Uncle, a mistake is
committed by mistake

946
01:28:25,798 --> 01:28:29,029
You must also haVe committed
a mistake, by mistake, no?

947
01:28:29,902 --> 01:28:33,429
Aunt, am l wrong? - You are
absolutely right, son-in-law

948
01:28:54,994 --> 01:28:56,985
Greetings.
- Greetings. Come in

949
01:28:59,465 --> 01:29:00,989
Colonel sahib...
- You!

950
01:29:02,168 --> 01:29:06,002
Don't you dare step inside!
Stay where you are

951
01:29:06,339 --> 01:29:10,469
Colonel sahib, consider it
my bad luck or my karma...

952
01:29:11,177 --> 01:29:14,340
for all my good intentions,
things inVariably go wrong...

953
01:29:14,847 --> 01:29:18,681
and l end up hurting you.
- 5000 people liVe around here

954
01:29:19,852 --> 01:29:25,188
Of all, why do you always
choose to hurt me?

955
01:29:25,358 --> 01:29:28,486
Colonel sahib, the new year is
about to set in, in a few hours time

956
01:29:29,028 --> 01:29:32,896
With the passing year, let
bygones be bygones, please

957
01:29:33,032 --> 01:29:34,693
l beg your forgiVeness

958
01:29:37,103 --> 01:29:39,697
D'you take me for a coward?

959
01:29:40,873 --> 01:29:43,967
Remember, l'm a soldier

960
01:29:45,444 --> 01:29:48,504
l kept forgiVing you because
l considered you a kid

961
01:29:49,248 --> 01:29:50,715
Not anymore

962
01:29:53,052 --> 01:29:54,883
Get this loud and clear

963
01:29:56,789 --> 01:29:59,883
Henceforth, for 50
metres around me...

964
01:29:59,959 --> 01:30:03,895
if l see you, or see you
throwing anything...

965
01:30:03,963 --> 01:30:07,899
the last time l fired my gun
was against the Portuguese...

966
01:30:07,967 --> 01:30:11,130
this time it's going to be you

967
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:14,733
Yes, colonel sahib

968
01:30:19,011 --> 01:30:22,538
Happy happy new...

969
01:30:26,419 --> 01:30:27,750
handcuffs

970
01:30:30,089 --> 01:30:34,492
ls this a new way to wish
a new year? - l'll tell you

971
01:30:35,361 --> 01:30:36,760
Where's Charles?

972
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:43,766
Charles? Or Sameer?
- Sameer?

973
01:30:44,837 --> 01:30:46,964
ls he a new kid in the Charles gang?

974
01:30:51,377 --> 01:30:53,368
HaVe women joined Charles' gang too?

975
01:30:54,847 --> 01:30:56,439
There's no aunty here! Oh, this one?

976
01:30:56,582 --> 01:31:02,782
What's the problem in his pants?
- Today he's become a police officer

977
01:31:02,955 --> 01:31:05,947
Become, eh? Tell me something...

978
01:31:06,025 --> 01:31:09,051
you're an honest officer's wife,
how do you know such criminals?

979
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:12,062
l'm not a criminal, ask
you neighbour if you wish

980
01:31:12,131 --> 01:31:15,191
Who neighbour? The retired soldier?

981
01:31:15,468 --> 01:31:19,063
Now l get it. After retirement
he's been sheltering criminals

982
01:31:19,405 --> 01:31:23,808
Let me go. Rani is waiting for me.
- Waiting for what?

983
01:31:26,078 --> 01:31:29,343
To murder someone? To loot a bank?

984
01:31:29,482 --> 01:31:32,315
Or to print fake stamp papers?
- What the hell...?

985
01:31:32,385 --> 01:31:36,219
Boy, you are going to rot here
until the police Van arriVes

986
01:31:36,989 --> 01:31:39,822
Then you'll go to jail. Come
on, don't stare at him

987
01:31:40,826 --> 01:31:46,423
The ass who smashed his head is on
the loose, and l'm trapped here

988
01:31:47,033 --> 01:31:50,332
Am l wearing a conVict's clothes?

989
01:31:50,836 --> 01:31:53,361
Am l going to meet Rani in 2010?

990
01:31:53,839 --> 01:31:55,830
Ladies and gentleman...

991
01:31:56,842 --> 01:32:01,006
and friends, let me show
you another magical act

992
01:32:02,014 --> 01:32:04,642
Look, this is magic

993
01:32:12,258 --> 01:32:15,193
ForgiVe me, Mr Magician, but
pulling out a bouquet from a cloth...

994
01:32:15,261 --> 01:32:19,027
a pigeon from a turban and a rabbit
from a box is quite simple

995
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:21,666
l'll belieVe you if you
can cast a spell on me

996
01:32:21,934 --> 01:32:24,129
He's challenging me

997
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:28,934
All right, boy, it's no big deal.
Lie down on the bench

998
01:32:29,008 --> 01:32:30,942
Sure. That's no big magic

999
01:32:31,277 --> 01:32:33,268
No, but it's going to be

1000
01:32:35,047 --> 01:32:42,283
Friends, now my magic wand is going
to suspend this boy in thin air

1001
01:32:47,059 --> 01:32:49,050
lf a stick can make someone
float in the air...

1002
01:32:49,128 --> 01:32:52,564
no one would care
to buy air tickets.

1003
01:32:53,065 --> 01:32:55,226
They would be waiting for the stick

1004
01:32:55,434 --> 01:33:00,895
l'm an astrologer, you see.
- Before you stands a magician, fool

1005
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,898
C'mon, lie down!
- At your serVice

1006
01:33:05,077 --> 01:33:06,408
Windbag!

1007
01:33:07,246 --> 01:33:08,304
Here l go

1008
01:33:08,447 --> 01:33:16,081
Abracadabra! Let the
boy float in air

1009
01:33:21,594 --> 01:33:26,531
Don't mess with a magician! Or,
you will stay suspended in air

1010
01:33:27,366 --> 01:33:30,460
Magician, l belieVe you now

1011
01:33:30,603 --> 01:33:33,538
l fear, l might go right up there

1012
01:33:33,939 --> 01:33:36,601
l pray, put me down

1013
01:33:36,675 --> 01:33:37,937
All right

1014
01:33:50,289 --> 01:33:52,553
How he lifted him up, we
didn't eVen get to know

1015
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:54,956
This girl wouldn't belieVe me

1016
01:33:56,462 --> 01:33:59,488
Rani, your arm on my shoulder
is one pretty sight

1017
01:34:01,033 --> 01:34:03,558
Let me make it simple
for you, Sameer

1018
01:34:03,969 --> 01:34:07,564
Stay 50 metres away from Papa and
500 metres away from me. You dig?

1019
01:34:07,973 --> 01:34:09,964
l'll show you guys a wonder now

1020
01:34:11,177 --> 01:34:13,771
You... please come here

1021
01:34:14,146 --> 01:34:16,137
Me...? - Don't go! He'll
put you in a box...

1022
01:34:16,215 --> 01:34:18,513
and hack you to pieces...

1023
01:34:18,584 --> 01:34:20,518
One boy. Any one, please

1024
01:34:20,586 --> 01:34:24,989
Mr Magician, there's a boy! Strong,
rough, tough and reliable

1025
01:34:25,157 --> 01:34:28,058
Seize your chance before
Sunny arriVes. Go!

1026
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:33,730
Come this side, please.
- No, l'm fine here

1027
01:34:33,799 --> 01:34:35,164
Please come here

1028
01:34:36,168 --> 01:34:38,728
lf he is in, l'm off.
Find someone else

1029
01:34:38,804 --> 01:34:39,998
Hang on, lady

1030
01:34:41,207 --> 01:34:43,004
Rather l'd leaVe

1031
01:34:43,609 --> 01:34:45,008
l get it

1032
01:34:45,511 --> 01:34:48,173
The two of you are cross with
each other. All right...

1033
01:34:48,247 --> 01:34:51,341
l'll turn the enmity into
friendship. - Can you do that?

1034
01:34:51,417 --> 01:34:53,681
Of course, and l'll turn
your hatred into loVe

1035
01:34:56,188 --> 01:34:58,349
Hang on. Your name?
- Rani

1036
01:34:58,424 --> 01:35:00,016
And you are...?
- Sameer

1037
01:35:00,192 --> 01:35:02,524
So, Sameer and Rani...

1038
01:35:03,362 --> 01:35:09,358
the two of you are man
and wife from now on

1039
01:35:10,369 --> 01:35:15,238
And tonight, is your
first New Year night

1040
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:22,443
Tell eVeryone how much
you loVe each other

1041
01:35:50,242 --> 01:35:52,870
What are you staring at?
- Admiring you

1042
01:35:54,413 --> 01:35:58,349
Had you not traipsed into my life,
l'd haVe been a nobody

1043
01:35:59,752 --> 01:36:01,413
l'd haVe been an anklet
sans the chime

1044
01:36:03,155 --> 01:36:05,146
l'd haVe been a soleless shoe

1045
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:08,252
A heartless body

1046
01:36:10,262 --> 01:36:12,890
lf not for you, Rani...
- Not Rani...

1047
01:36:14,266 --> 01:36:16,097
call me Mrs Sameer Malhotra

1048
01:36:19,772 --> 01:36:24,106
To be honest, l fell in loVe
with you at first sight

1049
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:26,901
l haVe endured so
much to possess you

1050
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:31,281
Don't torment me anymore. Come...

1051
01:36:33,519 --> 01:36:36,716
Well... l can wait no longer either

1052
01:36:52,304 --> 01:36:56,866
Your beloVed seeks your heart

1053
01:36:56,942 --> 01:36:58,534
Come to me, my loVe

1054
01:37:05,317 --> 01:37:10,220
Profess your loVe

1055
01:37:10,322 --> 01:37:12,153
GiVe in to me, my loVe

01:37:18,664 --> 01:37:23,328

l'm waiting for you

1058
01:37:28,707 --> 01:37:33,838

01:38:17,289 --> 01:38:19,883
like the tempest, my loVe

1062
01:38:25,564 --> 01:38:27,828
Your looks...

1063
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:30,391
my identity, my loVe

1064
01:38:30,736 --> 01:38:33,227
Gaze into my eyes

1065
01:38:36,408 --> 01:38:38,399
Make me belong to you

1066
01:38:41,413 --> 01:38:46,407
Profess your loVe

1067
01:38:46,485 --> 01:38:48,248
GiVe in to me, my loVe

1068
01:39:27,626 --> 01:39:32,359
You haVe done me a faVour

1069
01:39:38,303 --> 01:39:40,294
You are in my dreams...

1070
01:39:40,372 --> 01:39:42,806
you are all l desire

1071
01:39:43,509 --> 01:39:45,500
Let's make a legend of loVe

1072
01:39:48,647 --> 01:39:53,311
Come my loVe, make me
go crazy in your loVe

1073
01:39:53,519 --> 01:39:58,923
Profess your loVe

1074
01:39:58,991 --> 01:40:00,515
GiVe in to me, my loVe

1075
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:13,403
Your beloVed seeks your heart

1076
01:40:13,472 --> 01:40:15,337
Come to me, my loVe

1077
01:40:16,508 --> 01:40:21,343
Profess your loVe...

1078
01:40:21,413 --> 01:40:23,347
giVe in to me, my loVe

1079
01:40:44,536 --> 01:40:46,367
Come to me, my loVe

1080
01:41:47,766 --> 01:41:49,825
GiVe in to me, Sweetheart

1081
01:41:54,773 --> 01:42:00,769
The Prince has fallen in
loVe with the Princess...

1082
01:42:00,846 --> 01:42:03,781
Sameer, l'Ve been thinking.
- What?

1083
01:42:03,849 --> 01:42:07,114
You can play the guitar,
paint, sing...

1084
01:42:07,853 --> 01:42:10,788
you're quite a multi-talented man.
- Guess why?

1085
01:42:10,856 --> 01:42:13,120
That's because l'm me. Not you!

1086
01:42:16,795 --> 01:42:19,787
HaVing a ball, aren't you?
- You haVe a great talent too

1087
01:42:19,865 --> 01:42:23,801
What?
- You tell lies to fool people!

1088
01:42:26,872 --> 01:42:29,807
Listen, make a portrait for me too

1089
01:42:30,008 --> 01:42:33,000
Don't mind, but l paint
only beautiful people!

1090
01:42:37,816 --> 01:42:39,807
Know what?
- What, what?

1091
01:42:40,152 --> 01:42:43,144
l'm in a great mood today.
Say what you want to

1092
01:42:43,555 --> 01:42:46,490
You aren't as innocent
as you appear to be

1093
01:42:47,559 --> 01:42:48,890
Why?

1094
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,951
How you brought Rani around
in just two hours last night

1095
01:42:51,029 --> 01:42:52,155
Weren't you jealous!

1096
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:57,835
As close as you get to her, l
want to get closer to her too

1097
01:42:57,903 --> 01:43:00,895
Aren't you jealous? Aren't you?

1098
01:43:03,842 --> 01:43:05,833
What's your problem?

1099
01:43:05,911 --> 01:43:09,847
My problem is that l want to score
with my friend's girlfriends...

1100
01:43:09,915 --> 01:43:12,042
it makes me Very happy!

1101
01:43:22,861 --> 01:43:27,855
When l get married, l want you to
paint me and my wife together

1102
01:43:28,867 --> 01:43:32,200
You know, with her at my side.
And l lying down in her lap

1103
01:43:33,872 --> 01:43:35,863
She in black-and-white,
l in colour...

1104
01:43:35,941 --> 01:43:38,205
Sure, l will

1105
01:43:38,877 --> 01:43:41,209
Whom are you marrying? Bijli?

1106
01:43:41,613 --> 01:43:43,080
No, it's Rani

1107
01:43:44,883 --> 01:43:46,544
Aren't you jealous? Aren't you?

1108
01:43:46,618 --> 01:43:49,883
See? Your temper hurts you
yourself, doesn't it?

1109
01:43:50,889 --> 01:43:54,086
lf it wasn't for the oath, l'd haVe
squeezed him out like the tube!

1110
01:43:59,898 --> 01:44:01,559
Where's Sameer?
- The brush!

1111
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:04,232
Get to be the master's
disciple! Quick!

1112
01:44:07,906 --> 01:44:10,374
Life's a dream...

1113
01:44:13,912 --> 01:44:17,905
Who...? Rani, you...?

1114
01:44:17,983 --> 01:44:20,918
You can eVen paint!
- Well, l...

1115
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,252
My painting...? How sweet!

1116
01:44:25,924 --> 01:44:27,915
Tears and desires, that's how it is

1117
01:44:27,993 --> 01:44:30,257
You're quite a reVelation, Sunny.
- No reVelation

1118
01:44:30,929 --> 01:44:33,921
Painting, singing, the guitar...

1119
01:44:33,999 --> 01:44:36,263
No wonder they call
you multi-talented

1120
01:44:36,334 --> 01:44:37,995
Sameer's multi-talented too

1121
01:44:38,069 --> 01:44:40,594
You ought to haVe seen him
at the party last night

1122
01:44:40,672 --> 01:44:43,266
The way he sang and danced...

1123
01:44:45,143 --> 01:44:47,941
l'Ve been teaching him classical
dancing and he's into rock?

1124
01:44:49,948 --> 01:44:53,281
Anyway, fresh orange juice for
the two of you. Where's he?

1125
01:44:55,754 --> 01:44:57,619
He's in the latrine right now

1126
01:44:57,956 --> 01:45:01,016
He'll take some time. You can wait.
- No thank you

1127
01:45:01,693 --> 01:45:04,958
GiVe him some and you haVe
some too. Happy New Year

1128
01:45:16,975 --> 01:45:19,307
Was Rani here?
- Yes, she was

1129
01:45:19,978 --> 01:45:22,970
You'll now ask me if eVen my father
has eVen done any painting

1130
01:45:23,048 --> 01:45:27,314
And l'll say, my Papa's a Very
big businessman in lndore

1131
01:45:28,053 --> 01:45:31,181
You'll say, Liar, dog...
- That you really are

1132
01:45:31,323 --> 01:45:35,987
Your dream of making Rani fall in loVe
with you will remain a pipe dream

1133
01:45:36,061 --> 01:45:41,328
lt won't be a pipe dream. Because
l know what your weakness is

1134
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,991
Really? What is it?

1135
01:45:44,069 --> 01:45:47,334
You can neVer tell Rani
that you loVe her

1136
01:45:47,739 --> 01:45:51,004
So listen! l swear it on my grandma!

1137
01:45:52,077 --> 01:45:56,013
l will profess my loVe to Rani in
the presence of the whole world today!

1138
01:45:57,015 --> 01:45:59,483
And l swear it on my
father in lndore too

1139
01:46:00,886 --> 01:46:04,014
l'm the one who'll bring Rani
to this house, as a bride

1140
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:08,355
lf my loVe is true, l'll be
the one who'll marry Rani

1141
01:46:09,094 --> 01:46:13,030
And if l'm determined enough,
l'll lead her here by the hand

1142
01:46:14,766 --> 01:46:17,701
For me. You are Rani's brother

1143
01:46:18,236 --> 01:46:21,034
No brother. l'm her loVer

1144
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:27,038
Rani, you think this loVer-boy is
an accomplished singer and painter

1145
01:46:28,046 --> 01:46:30,241
l'll expose him to you today

1146
01:46:35,053 --> 01:46:37,044
C'mon, sweetheart, let's go

1147
01:46:37,122 --> 01:46:39,249
This juice Rani brought
for you l'll haVe it

1148
01:46:39,324 --> 01:46:42,054
Hold it! Who did she bring it for?
- For you

1149
01:46:42,127 --> 01:46:43,719
So l'll drink it!

1150
01:46:46,064 --> 01:46:47,725
Share it with me!

1151
01:46:48,133 --> 01:46:50,397
l can't share anything of Rani's!

1152
01:46:51,069 --> 01:46:53,731
May you find it bitter!

1153
01:46:54,072 --> 01:46:56,404
l find eVerything of
Rani's to be sweet

1154
01:46:58,810 --> 01:47:00,141
At least let out a burp!

1155
01:47:06,818 --> 01:47:10,083
l'll paint a picture and
also sing a song...

1156
01:47:10,155 --> 01:47:12,419
and expose Sunny. Okay?

1157
01:47:21,099 --> 01:47:26,093
What new ailment is this? One
Duggal is difficult to tolerate

1158
01:47:29,107 --> 01:47:33,567
Three, fiVe...? More
than l can endure!

1159
01:47:58,136 --> 01:48:00,468
Where do you think you're
going? Stop there!

1160
01:48:13,151 --> 01:48:15,483
Lie down here, Rani. l'll
put them to bed and return

1161
01:48:20,158 --> 01:48:22,490
C'mon! Eagle!

1162
01:48:24,162 --> 01:48:26,153
l'm going to make you a seagull!

1163
01:48:28,166 --> 01:48:31,158
Senior! Swat this fly!

1164
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:41,839
You'Ve made a mistake by messing
with the Eagle Gang!

1165
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:16,203
One Sunny l can't tolerate. And
six of them walk up to me!

1166
01:49:17,215 --> 01:49:19,547
l'm going to thrash all
six of them! C'mon!

1167
01:52:09,387 --> 01:52:11,048
Tommy! Come here! Come!

1168
01:52:18,730 --> 01:52:22,723
You always bark at me, don't
you? So bark now... bark!

1169
01:52:24,402 --> 01:52:27,394
The next time you bark, you're
going to disappear. You get that...?

1170
01:52:28,473 --> 01:52:31,465
Take care of your
kids and your dogs!

1171
01:52:33,411 --> 01:52:35,743
l'll spare you this time.
Next time, you're gone

1172
01:52:39,617 --> 01:52:42,415
Tommy, my son, don't
keep going outside

1173
01:52:42,487 --> 01:52:45,479
There are bad people in the locality

1174
01:52:47,425 --> 01:52:51,088
HaVe l eVer raised my
Voice with you? HaVe l?

1175
01:52:51,429 --> 01:52:55,763
And how Sameer was yelling at you
yesterday! The insolent chap!

1176
01:52:56,501 --> 01:53:02,770
Go and play in the house, son. And
don't go out... my good son!

1177
01:53:46,484 --> 01:53:50,818
Tommy! Tommy...

1178
01:53:54,559 --> 01:53:57,153
Tommy, where haVe you gone?

1179
01:53:58,563 --> 01:54:01,828
You ought to haVe considered what
would happen to me without you!

1180
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:04,832
Darling, we too are sad
that Tommy's gone missing

1181
01:54:05,303 --> 01:54:08,568
But how long will you keep
starVing, thinking about him?

1182
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:10,834
Let's eat, Papa. l'm hungry too

1183
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:15,502
No, my child. l don't feel like it

1184
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:17,172
Colonel...

1185
01:54:20,518 --> 01:54:24,921
l'Ve looked eVerywhere in Goa,
but there's no trace of Tommy

1186
01:54:25,590 --> 01:54:29,856
l don't know where he has gone.
Could someone haVe kidnapped him?

1187
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:32,860
But who could be Tommy's enemy?

1188
01:54:33,598 --> 01:54:36,590
Mr Duggal! That's it

1189
01:54:37,735 --> 01:54:40,863
No... he hasn't been around
since yesterday

1190
01:54:43,241 --> 01:54:45,869
Sameer...?
- Why Sameer?

1191
01:54:46,611 --> 01:54:50,877
No, can't be Sameer. But he could
do a thing like this too.

1192
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:56,543
Remember his public threat? That
he'd make the dog disappear!

1193
01:54:56,687 --> 01:54:59,554
lf the dog barks, l'll kill
him, l'll finish him!

1194
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:04,753
No way, he was drunk.
- Really...? But who then...?

1195
01:55:05,296 --> 01:55:07,230
He's the culprit!

1196
01:55:08,366 --> 01:55:09,697
Who is it?

1197
01:55:09,767 --> 01:55:12,235
That scoundrel has broken me
in eVery part of my body!

1198
01:55:13,638 --> 01:55:16,232
l don't know what reVenge
he is extracting from me...

1199
01:55:16,307 --> 01:55:19,242
by haVing Tommy separated from me!

1200
01:55:21,579 --> 01:55:25,572
Sameer! Where are you
hiding, you thief?

1201
01:55:26,384 --> 01:55:32,254
This is a warning! lf you don't
return Tommy to me in 24 hours...

1202
01:55:32,590 --> 01:55:34,581
l'll haVe you sent to jail!

1203
01:55:35,326 --> 01:55:39,660
l still hold sway among the cops.
l'm not sparing you!

1204
01:55:39,730 --> 01:55:41,721
What does that mean?
- He has influence

1205
01:55:41,799 --> 01:55:43,790
GiVe him the dog! May
the worms get you!

1206
01:55:43,935 --> 01:55:47,928
What new fuss is this...?
HaVe your father treated

1207
01:55:48,339 --> 01:55:51,934
Why'd l haVe my brother-in-law
kidnapped anyway? Why...?

1208
01:55:53,611 --> 01:55:55,602
Where am l going to look
for this dog now?

1209
01:56:05,356 --> 01:56:07,620
You haVe a Variety of dogs
- Hush!

1210
01:56:07,959 --> 01:56:09,950
Don't call them dogs.
They take offense

1211
01:56:10,628 --> 01:56:12,619
l'Ve brought them up
like my own children

1212
01:56:13,431 --> 01:56:17,629
That's Rustom, that's Sohrab.
Eats less, snarls all the time

1213
01:56:17,969 --> 01:56:24,306
That's Cyrus. Faithful. But
eats and enjoys a good life

1214
01:56:24,442 --> 01:56:25,966
And that is...

1215
01:56:26,711 --> 01:56:28,770
This is the dog l want.
Do you haVe it?

1216
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:32,713
l do haVe it! That's
my boy, Tin Tin!

1217
01:56:33,384 --> 01:56:35,318
Say hello!

1218
01:56:43,661 --> 01:56:48,997
Quite a good boy. But once
he loses his temper...

1219
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:51,732
he's going to bite. And remember...

1220
01:56:51,802 --> 01:56:54,999
don't eVer giVe him a cold bath

1221
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:59,005
But this one doesn't haVe a
black spot. - Don't worry!

1222
01:57:00,411 --> 01:57:02,345
Here's the solution!

1223
01:57:13,691 --> 01:57:16,888
Mr Colonel... look who's here

1224
01:57:18,696 --> 01:57:23,030
Tommy! My son...! Where
had you gone away to?

1225
01:57:24,035 --> 01:57:26,697
Where did you find him, Sameer?
- The poor chap...

1226
01:57:26,771 --> 01:57:29,763
was sitting by a lamp-post, shiVering.
He used to always bark at me

1227
01:57:30,708 --> 01:57:34,701
But this time, he said, Papa...
and went for my feet

1228
01:57:34,779 --> 01:57:38,044
He appeared to be telling me,
Please take me to my Papa

1229
01:57:38,716 --> 01:57:41,048
Papa...?
- You

1230
01:57:41,719 --> 01:57:44,051
Oh yes! He's like my son, of course!

1231
01:57:46,724 --> 01:57:49,716
Papa, it's because of Sameer
that we haVe Tommy back today

1232
01:57:49,794 --> 01:57:52,922
You must forgiVe him at least now.
- Sure, l forgiVe him!

1233
01:57:53,464 --> 01:57:55,398
Rama, lay the table

1234
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:04,872
What's happening here?

1235
01:58:05,476 --> 01:58:07,808
Look at this, Sunny! Tommy's
back today because of Sameer

1236
01:58:17,755 --> 01:58:23,751
Look me in the eye, my brother!
Where did you find the dog...?

1237
01:58:24,095 --> 01:58:27,428
Where did you find it? l
went mad looking for it!

1238
01:58:27,765 --> 01:58:30,427
For Rani's sake, look into my eyes!

1239
01:58:31,102 --> 01:58:35,766
Where did you find the dog? Tell me!

1240
01:58:37,975 --> 01:58:42,776
Sunny, l don't know what's
gotten into my Tommy

1241
01:58:43,781 --> 01:58:46,443
He's been behaVing like a stranger
eVer since he has returned

1242
01:58:47,518 --> 01:58:50,783
He seems to haVe changed.
- He has stayed with the stray dogs

1243
01:58:51,789 --> 01:58:55,782
l know a cure! Squeeze him
in a bucket of cold water!

1244
01:58:56,794 --> 01:58:59,786
Squeeze him ?
- l mean, giVe him a cold bath

1245
01:58:59,864 --> 01:59:01,456
Oh, l see. All right

1246
01:59:04,802 --> 01:59:08,465
Please sit down.
- Won't you giVe Tommy a bath?

1247
01:59:08,873 --> 01:59:12,138
No! l'll first giVe Tommy a bath.
l'll haVe breakfast later

1248
01:59:12,810 --> 01:59:15,142
The breakfast will get cold, papa.
- l'll be back soon, my child

1249
01:59:15,813 --> 01:59:18,805
Let's take a bath, Tommy boy!
- Where's Sameer?

1250
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:22,813
Sunny, please call Sameer, will
you? - Not me, he sleeps till late

1251
01:59:22,887 --> 01:59:26,482
He'll hit me for no reason.
You go and call him instead

1252
01:59:27,625 --> 01:59:29,490
All right, l'll call him

1253
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:31,892
We shall oVercome...

1254
01:59:39,570 --> 01:59:40,901
Who is it?

1255
01:59:41,839 --> 01:59:43,830
Are you asleep, Sameer? Wake up!

1256
01:59:44,842 --> 01:59:48,175
Sunny, don't change your Voice
and bother me! Let me sleep!

1257
01:59:57,188 --> 01:59:59,850
Rani...? One second.
l'll be out there

1258
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:11,932
Who are you...?

1259
02:00:12,870 --> 02:00:14,861
Who on earth are you?
- Bijli

1260
02:00:14,939 --> 02:00:16,998
But who...?
- lt's Rani

1261
02:00:17,608 --> 02:00:20,202
One moment, Rani. l'm coming!
What are you doing here?

1262
02:00:20,611 --> 02:00:22,545
What?
- What are you doing here?

1263
02:00:22,613 --> 02:00:24,547
l was sleeping with you

1264
02:00:24,615 --> 02:00:26,549
l came to call you for breakfast

1265
02:00:26,884 --> 02:00:28,875
l'Ve said nothing! l'll
join you in two seconds!

1266
02:00:29,887 --> 02:00:31,218
Go away!
- Where?

1267
02:00:31,622 --> 02:00:33,556
Want me to come...?
- Go away!

1268
02:00:33,624 --> 02:00:34,955
GiVe that to me?
- What?

1269
02:00:35,025 --> 02:00:37,016
That one.
- What?

1270
02:00:38,629 --> 02:00:40,563
l'm coming inside

1271
02:00:40,631 --> 02:00:42,223
God!

1272
02:00:53,644 --> 02:00:55,908
l'm so sorry, Rani. How disgusting!

1273
02:00:56,247 --> 02:01:00,911
What you think is wrong, Rani!
- How about what l see?

1274
02:01:01,919 --> 02:01:04,911
This one...? lt's not
mine. lt's hers!

1275
02:01:05,256 --> 02:01:08,248
l'Ve done nothing wrong, Rani.
Please try to understand...

1276
02:01:09,927 --> 02:01:11,588
You...

1277
02:01:12,663 --> 02:01:15,257
l'll fix you! Rani...

1278
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:21,001
That piece of thorn

1279
02:01:34,752 --> 02:01:36,743
l swear it on you, Rani!
l don't know that girl!

1280
02:01:36,821 --> 02:01:38,948
How could you with a girl
you don't know...?

1281
02:01:39,957 --> 02:01:43,620
l swear, l don't eVen know her!
- Without knowing them...

1282
02:01:43,961 --> 02:01:46,623
will you call just about any girl?
- Listen to me, Rani...

1283
02:01:46,697 --> 02:01:49,029
You'Ve started getting girls
into your bed now!

1284
02:01:54,972 --> 02:01:56,963
This is too much, Rani!
Listen to me!

1285
02:02:08,986 --> 02:02:12,183
Hey girl, can't you hear what
boss is saying to you?

1286
02:02:12,723 --> 02:02:14,657
Do just as the boss says. Okay?

1287
02:02:15,993 --> 02:02:18,985
Else the Eagle Gang will catch you
and present you to the boss, okay?

1288
02:02:19,063 --> 02:02:21,054
What are you guys saying?
- Command us, boss!

1289
02:02:21,198 --> 02:02:24,998
No one dares oppose you! Do what
you want to. Here on the streets!

1290
02:02:25,069 --> 02:02:26,331
Go for her! Grab her!

1291
02:02:27,004 --> 02:02:29,666
Grab her...?
- No, l won't

1292
02:02:30,007 --> 02:02:32,999
This was all that was left! You're
a loafer. And a drunkard!

1293
02:02:33,077 --> 02:02:36,069
You're a womaniser! Now you're
leader of the Eagle gang!

1294
02:02:36,146 --> 02:02:38,137
l'm not the leader.
- Shame on you, Sameer!

1295
02:02:39,083 --> 02:02:43,019
Forget her, boss. There's one
better than the other in Goa

1296
02:02:43,087 --> 02:02:46,352
Point out a girl. She'll
be in your arms

1297
02:02:54,865 --> 02:03:00,235
After a nice cold bath... Tommy
will become a handsome boy

1298
02:03:01,205 --> 02:03:05,141
He'll be good looking. Those
dirty dogs in the lane...?

1299
02:03:05,242 --> 02:03:09,508
don't eVer play with them, okay?
See how dirty you are

1300
02:03:11,215 --> 02:03:15,117
Good boy! Good boy!

1301
02:03:15,185 --> 02:03:16,709
BraVo...

1302
02:03:21,058 --> 02:03:24,892
What's this? A black dye?

1303
02:03:27,231 --> 02:03:29,995
So this isn't my Tommy! Hey...

1304
02:03:32,903 --> 02:03:34,734
are you a wild dog?

1305
02:03:44,915 --> 02:03:47,816
Rama! The dog has bitten me!

1306
02:03:49,954 --> 02:03:53,355
Rama! lt isn't our Tommy!

1307
02:03:58,028 --> 02:04:04,024
lt's a duplicate of Tommy! Sameer
has giVen us a wild dog!

1308
02:04:05,035 --> 02:04:09,836
The black dye came off when
l was giVing it a bath! Look!

1309
02:04:09,974 --> 02:04:14,843
l'm not sparing Sameer! He's
made the dog bite me!

1310
02:04:15,312 --> 02:04:18,110
God! He acts like a butcher!

1311
02:04:18,949 --> 02:04:20,382
After beating him black and blue..

1312
02:04:20,451 --> 02:04:22,248
..he's now setting
the dogs after him!

1313
02:04:22,319 --> 02:04:24,514
He has no respect for his elders!

1314
02:04:24,588 --> 02:04:26,852
He'll need to take 14 injections
in the stomach now

1315
02:04:26,924 --> 02:04:29,188
Go and take the first one.
- Go on...

1316
02:04:30,527 --> 02:04:32,290
Tiny injections they'll giVe him

1317
02:04:41,872 --> 02:04:44,466
Sameer, l'm Raj, the astrologer

1318
02:04:44,541 --> 02:04:48,136
Here you are! And l'Ve been
looking for you all oVer Goa

1319
02:04:48,212 --> 02:04:51,807
l'm looking for Sameer, too.
Let me know if you find him

1320
02:04:51,882 --> 02:04:54,817
l want to break his limbs!
- No...

1321
02:04:54,885 --> 02:04:58,412
liquor isn't good for you!
- lt's blessed wine

1322
02:05:06,096 --> 02:05:10,829
Look! Rani and Sunny...

1323
02:05:11,435 --> 02:05:14,893

Let's rock to the music,

02:06:17,968 --> 02:06:26,103
The sight of you has driVen me
out of my mind, O beautiful one

1331
02:06:27,177 --> 02:06:33,309
Watch the wonders this boy is

Come into my arms...

1333

02:07:13,190 --> 02:07:16,956
Take oVer my heart...

02:07:17,127 --> 02:07:20,426
you'll be my life itself

1336
02:07:20,497 --> 02:07:27,130

in my heart, beautiful one

1338
02:07:41,218 --> 02:07:46,155

lt's a trap laid by my beauty

Rickety old rickshaw!

02:10:13,470 --> 02:10:16,803
Here you are.
- But this is 20 Rupees

1356
02:10:18,308 --> 02:10:22,142
EVery senior citizen gets
a discount of 50 per cent

1357
02:10:22,479 --> 02:10:25,141
Whether it's the bus
or a railway train

1358
02:10:25,315 --> 02:10:27,681
Besides, yours is a
rickety old rickshaw!

1359
02:10:34,891 --> 02:10:36,324
Grandma!

1360
02:10:37,227 --> 02:10:39,161
Grandma is here!

1361
02:10:40,497 --> 02:10:45,161
Look at this kid! He's
calling me a grandma!

1362
02:10:45,335 --> 02:10:49,829
Sameer...
- Grandma, don't call Sameer

1363
02:10:49,906 --> 02:10:51,498
He's a bad boy!
- Why?

1364
02:10:51,575 --> 02:10:53,975
He ran away with my
chocolate yesterday

1365
02:10:54,444 --> 02:10:58,346
And today, l will run
away with your glasses!

1366
02:10:59,516 --> 02:11:03,350
GiVe my glasses to me!
- l'm running away... come after me!

1367
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:05,351
My glasses...
- What's happening here?

1368
02:11:06,456 --> 02:11:09,687
Make this old fossil
see reason, please

1369
02:11:10,527 --> 02:11:12,722
But he's my husband.
- What!

1370
02:11:14,364 --> 02:11:16,696
No, l'm her son!
- Son?

1371
02:11:17,367 --> 02:11:22,703
She's my Mummy! Mummy, ask grandma
to get me a chocolate!

1372
02:11:22,806 --> 02:11:26,207
My darling son, giVe
my glasses to me

1373
02:11:26,376 --> 02:11:28,207
On one condition.
- What?

1374
02:11:28,378 --> 02:11:31,541
We'll play Cricket with it.
- l can't see anything!

1375
02:11:31,615 --> 02:11:35,210
l'll toss it up like a ball.
You must catch it

1376
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:47,894
EVeryone in Rani's family hates me.
That includes her dog, Tommy

1377
02:11:49,633 --> 02:11:51,965
Grandma, that's your grandson's
loVe story then

1378
02:11:52,402 --> 02:11:55,963
Now you tell me what l am to do.
- My son...

1379
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:58,232
why must you worry?

1380
02:11:58,575 --> 02:12:01,635
Now that l haVe arriVed, eVerything
will be all right

1381
02:12:02,412 --> 02:12:06,974
Just show me the girl once. l'll go
and talk it oVer with her, okay?

1382
02:12:07,417 --> 02:12:09,783
Come, l'll show you.
- My son!

1383
02:12:13,990 --> 02:12:15,753
That's Rani, grandma

1384
02:12:20,597 --> 02:12:22,792
Where, son...?
- OVer there, grandma

1385
02:12:22,866 --> 02:12:24,265
She's right there

1386
02:12:27,437 --> 02:12:29,268
Yes, yes...
- lsn't she beautiful?

1387
02:12:29,339 --> 02:12:33,537
Absolutely beautiful! But
l can't see a thing!

1388
02:12:36,613 --> 02:12:40,276
You go to the office and get
on with your work, my son

1389
02:12:40,350 --> 02:12:43,285
l'll go to her house and
talk it oVer, okay?

1390
02:12:43,453 --> 02:12:46,081
Okay, grandma.
- Bye, son

1391
02:12:58,635 --> 02:13:01,297
My child...
- l'm here, ma'am

1392
02:13:03,039 --> 02:13:07,100
What spell haVe you cast on Sameer?
- What?

1393
02:13:07,377 --> 02:13:09,572
He's madly in loVe with you!

1394
02:13:09,813 --> 02:13:14,910
You're the only one he talks about,
in eVerything he does

1395
02:13:15,385 --> 02:13:18,377
What are you talking about?
You know the Colonel...

1396
02:13:18,488 --> 02:13:23,323
My child, l know the Colonel
is Very angry with Sameer

1397
02:13:24,861 --> 02:13:28,592
Once you agree to the wedding...

1398
02:13:28,865 --> 02:13:31,663
the Colonel will haVe
to get out of your way!

1399
02:13:34,538 --> 02:13:38,838
My child, do not be afraid. lf
you're in loVe with Sameer...

1400
02:13:38,942 --> 02:13:41,342
not the Colonel and
not any power in..

1401
02:13:41,411 --> 02:13:43,402
..the world can separate you both!

1402
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:47,013
Sameer? And Rama?

1403
02:13:49,753 --> 02:13:55,350
My grandson will giVe you the
bliss the Colonel neVer could

1404
02:13:57,861 --> 02:14:02,855
lf you're afraid of the Colonel,
l'll help the two of you elope!

1405
02:14:10,540 --> 02:14:12,531
Sameer hasn't come yet.
l wonder what's up

1406
02:14:12,609 --> 02:14:13,974
He'll come, grandma

1407
02:14:15,378 --> 02:14:16,970
Here he is.
- Grandma...

1408
02:14:18,114 --> 02:14:21,174
HaVe you talked it oVer, grandma?
- Oh yes, son. l haVe

1409
02:14:21,551 --> 02:14:24,384
Very good. Has Rani agreed?
- Yes, Rani has agreed

1410
02:14:24,554 --> 02:14:25,885
You now need to talk to her mother..

1411
02:14:25,956 --> 02:14:27,548
..and she'll bring
the Colonel around

1412
02:14:27,724 --> 02:14:30,784
Make an eleVen rupee offering.
And that'll be it!

1413
02:14:33,897 --> 02:14:37,663
Grandma! That's water! The
coffee's in this one here!

1414
02:14:38,802 --> 02:14:40,793
EVer since my glasses haVe broken..

1415
02:14:40,870 --> 02:14:43,134
..l can't see a single thing, my son

1416
02:14:43,573 --> 02:14:46,406
Grandma, how could you haVe
spoken to Rani then?

1417
02:14:46,576 --> 02:14:50,410
One uses his mouth to speak,
my son. Not one's eyes

1418
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:53,572
You must'Ve chosen right.
- Sure

1419
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:56,412
How many fingers, grandma?
- Four

1420
02:14:56,753 --> 02:14:58,687
Three... two...
- Grandma!

1421
02:14:59,923 --> 02:15:05,828
l'm not totally blind yet, son.
l can still see a bit

1422
02:15:05,962 --> 02:15:09,921
And why must you worry? Go and
talk it oVer with Rani's mother

1423
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,433
Sameer!

1424
02:15:11,768 --> 02:15:14,601
Let me haVe your glasses
fixed, ma'am

1425
02:15:15,839 --> 02:15:18,774
ln just a little while, we'll
reach your in-laws' house

1426
02:15:19,609 --> 02:15:21,042
And here we are!

1427
02:15:21,611 --> 02:15:24,603
Praise the Colonel!
- What are you doing?

1428
02:15:24,681 --> 02:15:26,979
Holy water from St. Peter's church.

1429
02:15:27,617 --> 02:15:29,608
Go on. Neither is the
old man there...

1430
02:15:29,686 --> 02:15:31,847
..nor is your future wife.

1431
02:15:32,522 --> 02:15:34,513
Go and talk it oVer with your
future mother-in-law!

1432
02:15:35,191 --> 02:15:36,886
Will she listen to me?
- Of course

1433
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,951
Just latch the door from inside!
- Why ?

1434
02:15:39,529 --> 02:15:42,464
Neither will she go out,
nor will she send you out

1435
02:15:42,632 --> 02:15:45,726
Once the matter is settled,
unlatch the door. Very simple

1436
02:15:48,738 --> 02:15:50,467
Go on. l'm right here!

1437
02:15:55,812 --> 02:15:58,474
Sameer... why are you
latching the door?

1438
02:15:59,149 --> 02:16:01,549
So that you don't send
me out of the house...

1439
02:16:02,686 --> 02:16:04,677
nor leaVe the house yourself

1440
02:16:10,493 --> 02:16:12,484
Was this the time for this angel
of death to return...?

1441
02:16:12,896 --> 02:16:17,560
What you're doing is wrong, Sameer

1442
02:16:18,234 --> 02:16:22,671
ls falling in loVe wrong?
l ask you...

1443
02:16:23,673 --> 02:16:26,164
haVe you neVer been in loVe?
- Well, l...

1444
02:16:26,710 --> 02:16:28,507
You haVe, haVen't you?

1445
02:16:29,579 --> 02:16:31,774
So why all the restrictions
in my loVe?

1446
02:16:32,782 --> 02:16:34,511
Now look, Sameer. You...

1447
02:16:34,851 --> 02:16:38,844
Sameer! Where's Sameer?

1448
02:16:39,689 --> 02:16:41,680
He's in there, with your wife
- What...?

1449
02:16:41,791 --> 02:16:44,191
You can't go inside till
Sameer's work is oVer

1450
02:16:44,594 --> 02:16:46,585
Till Sameer's work is done...?

1451
02:16:47,197 --> 02:16:50,689
GiVe me an opportunity. l haVe
so much to giVe in loVe!

1452
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:54,600
l beg you, Sameer. Please go away

1453
02:16:54,938 --> 02:16:59,034
No. Unless you agree,
l can't go away

1454
02:16:59,142 --> 02:17:01,702
lt'll take only two minutes.
Let him do it, Colonel!

1455
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:04,540
l'll see what he's upto!

1456
02:17:05,715 --> 02:17:06,807
Colonel!

1457
02:17:07,050 --> 02:17:10,281
Why're you so scared eVen after
grandma has spoken to you?

1458
02:17:11,721 --> 02:17:13,746
The Colonel used to be a colonel.

1459
02:17:14,724 --> 02:17:16,214
And you are the colonel
of this family

1460
02:17:16,559 --> 02:17:19,551
lf you say yes, what can
the colonel do about it?

1461
02:17:20,964 --> 02:17:23,728
For God's sake, leaVe my sari alone!

1462
02:17:24,234 --> 02:17:25,633
Let them get on with it!

1463
02:17:25,769 --> 02:17:29,170
lf the youngsters run away,
who'll lose face...?

1464
02:17:29,239 --> 02:17:30,729
Who'll get a bad name...?
- Get lost!

1465
02:17:33,743 --> 02:17:34,903
Your sari's stuck

1466
02:17:36,646 --> 02:17:39,308
Don't worry. l'll haVe it freed

1467
02:18:05,108 --> 02:18:06,769
Look at the eVil man!

1468
02:18:31,801 --> 02:18:33,792
What's on your mind, my child?

1469
02:18:34,971 --> 02:18:37,804
like you folks think

1470
02:18:37,874 --> 02:18:40,900
Nothing happened...

1471
02:18:41,377 --> 02:18:43,641
Sameer didn't misbehaVe with me

1472
02:18:45,048 --> 02:18:47,039
l thought Very hard oVer it

1473
02:18:48,818 --> 02:18:50,649
What l feel is...

1474
02:18:51,054 --> 02:18:53,045
he had come to talk about you

1475
02:18:55,058 --> 02:18:57,720
He's madly in loVe with
you. What about you?

1476
02:18:58,828 --> 02:19:00,921
ls it Sameer? Or Sunny?

1477
02:19:01,164 --> 02:19:02,654
l don't understand, Mama

1478
02:19:03,833 --> 02:19:05,664
Sunny is a nice guy

1479
02:19:08,938 --> 02:19:12,465
l like Sameer too.
But Papa hates him

1480
02:19:13,843 --> 02:19:15,777
l'm in a dilemma.
- Look, my child...

1481
02:19:15,845 --> 02:19:18,075
don't worry about mine
and your father's likes

1482
02:19:19,015 --> 02:19:20,949
Decide for yourself

1483
02:19:22,018 --> 02:19:24,748
l'm finding it difficult to decide

1484
02:19:25,855 --> 02:19:29,484
What you got to gauge is,
who loVes you the most...

1485
02:19:30,226 --> 02:19:32,285
Sameer, or Sunny

1486
02:19:32,896 --> 02:19:35,865
And if you are still confused,
leaVe it to God

1487
02:20:17,407 --> 02:20:21,537
My red Veil...

1488
02:20:21,744 --> 02:20:25,805
flutters in the flowing wind

1489
02:20:31,821 --> 02:20:34,346
And my beloVed casts
glances at me...

1490
02:20:34,924 --> 02:20:36,755
on the sly

1491
02:20:36,926 --> 02:20:39,554
l know he will loVe me...

1492
02:20:39,829 --> 02:20:42,491
but he'll make my life miserable

1493
02:20:49,372 --> 02:20:51,033
Red Veil...

1494
02:20:52,108 --> 02:20:53,769
your red Veil...

1495
02:20:53,843 --> 02:20:57,779
flutters in the flowing wind

1496
02:20:58,047 --> 02:21:02,984
Your red Veil flutters
in the flowing wind

1497
02:21:04,187 --> 02:21:06,451
And your beloVed casts
glances at you...

1498
02:21:06,956 --> 02:21:08,787
on the sly

1499
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:11,790
l'll giVe you my heart...

1500
02:21:11,995 --> 02:21:14,793
l'll eVen die for you

1501
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:56,495
For all my efforts to
hide my pretty face...

1502
02:21:57,006 --> 02:21:59,634
it hardly took time for
the cruel breeze...

1503
02:22:00,009 --> 02:22:02,170
to break my resolVe

1504
02:22:05,515 --> 02:22:11,010
Your moon-like face has
cast a spell all around

1505
02:22:11,254 --> 02:22:13,245
The sight of you...

1506
02:22:13,322 --> 02:22:16,849
puts eVen the moon to shame

1507
02:22:20,029 --> 02:22:22,862
l'm coy.
- Goodness me

1508
02:22:23,032 --> 02:22:25,523
l'm apprehensiVe.
- Goodness me

1509
02:22:26,069 --> 02:22:31,371
Come into my arms, let not
this opportunity go wasted

1510
02:22:32,041 --> 02:22:34,669
Your beloVed has already seen you...

1511
02:22:35,044 --> 02:22:36,875
on the sly, though

1512
02:22:37,046 --> 02:22:39,537
l'll giVe you my heart...

1513
02:22:40,049 --> 02:22:42,483
l'll eVen die for you

1514
02:22:43,052 --> 02:22:45,384
l know he will loVe me...

1515
02:22:45,621 --> 02:22:48,556
but he'll make life miserable for me

1516
02:23:19,088 --> 02:23:21,249
This fragrant ambience...

1517
02:23:21,424 --> 02:23:24,188
inVites us to make loVe

1518
02:23:24,327 --> 02:23:27,091
My pretty loVe...

1519
02:23:27,263 --> 02:23:29,993
giVe in to your beloVed

1520
02:23:33,336 --> 02:23:36,271
The fragrance of your loVe...

1521
02:23:36,339 --> 02:23:38,933
has merged into my breath

1522
02:23:39,108 --> 02:23:42,100
Here, my loVe, l giVe
up eVerything...

1523
02:23:42,178 --> 02:23:44,544
l giVe in to you

1524
02:23:47,950 --> 02:23:50,612
You are desirous...
- Goodness me

1525
02:23:50,686 --> 02:23:53,348
you admit.
- Goodness me

1526
02:23:53,623 --> 02:23:56,285
No stopping me now...

1527
02:23:56,359 --> 02:23:59,123
l'm unstoppable

1528
02:23:59,629 --> 02:24:01,961
My beloVed has seen me...

1529
02:24:02,031 --> 02:24:04,363
on the sly

1530
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:07,469
l know he will loVe me...

1531
02:24:07,703 --> 02:24:10,501
but he'll make life miserable for me

1532
02:24:10,706 --> 02:24:13,368
l'll giVe you my heart...

1533
02:24:13,509 --> 02:24:16,137
l'll eVen die for you

1534
02:24:17,246 --> 02:24:19,305
My red Veil...

1535
02:24:19,382 --> 02:24:22,146
flutters in the flowing wind

1536
02:24:23,186 --> 02:24:25,313
Your red Veil...

1537
02:24:25,388 --> 02:24:27,982
flutters in the flowing wind

1538
02:24:29,158 --> 02:24:31,319
And your beloVed casts
glances at you...

1539
02:24:31,394 --> 02:24:33,589
on the sly, though

1540
02:24:33,996 --> 02:24:36,590
l know he will loVe me...

1541
02:24:36,999 --> 02:24:39,661
but he'll make my life miserable

1542
02:24:40,169 --> 02:24:42,501
l'll giVe you my heart...

1543
02:24:42,738 --> 02:24:45,536
l'll eVen die for you

1544
02:24:58,821 --> 02:25:02,018
My son, you came here
in quest of peace

1545
02:25:02,225 --> 02:25:05,217
Where will you go now?
- l'll go to a place...

1546
02:25:05,361 --> 02:25:09,195
where there are no people at all.
The Andaman-Nicobar islands

1547
02:25:09,298 --> 02:25:13,029
You'll clash with a guy eVen if
he's the only one around in town

1548
02:25:13,102 --> 02:25:16,037
Do what you will, but you
can't change your destiny

1549
02:25:17,206 --> 02:25:20,539
l know how much you
loVe Rani, my son

1550
02:25:21,377 --> 02:25:23,368
Will you leaVe her also and go away?

1551
02:25:23,446 --> 02:25:25,038
l'm not happy to leaVe

1552
02:25:25,715 --> 02:25:28,548
l haVe to go away. That's
how the situation is

1553
02:25:30,219 --> 02:25:32,483
Let's go, grandma. lt's
time the boat sailed

1554
02:25:54,410 --> 02:25:56,071
Look after yourself.
- Sameer...

1555
02:25:57,413 --> 02:26:00,405
well, well! The priest,
if not Rani, what say?

1556
02:26:03,486 --> 02:26:05,477
What's up?
- l'm leaVing

1557
02:26:05,621 --> 02:26:08,488
Hey! You can't leaVe me and go away

1558
02:26:09,258 --> 02:26:11,488
Not you alone. l'm leaVing
this world behind

1559
02:26:12,695 --> 02:26:14,890
You'Ve only seen Rani
and me getting together

1560
02:26:15,431 --> 02:26:17,092
Won't you stay for the wedding?

1561
02:26:18,167 --> 02:26:21,694
Guess who played the biggest role
in bringing Rani and me together?

1562
02:26:23,439 --> 02:26:26,772
He kept making mistakes and
she kept getting closer to me

1563
02:26:27,376 --> 02:26:30,174
Oh yes, that's a solid
idea you gaVe me!

1564
02:26:30,313 --> 02:26:32,611
Of publicly proposing to Rani!

1565
02:26:32,715 --> 02:26:35,775
lncidentally, lndia and Pakistan
are playing a cricket match today

1566
02:26:35,851 --> 02:26:38,843
l'Ve inVited her father.
Rani will be there too

1567
02:26:39,188 --> 02:26:41,713
l'm thinking of saying
it to her in public!

1568
02:26:46,295 --> 02:26:49,128
Rani, will you marry me?

1569
02:26:51,300 --> 02:26:52,631
You're lucky...

1570
02:26:54,737 --> 02:26:57,797
because l'Ve stopped
dreaming about Rani

1571
02:26:59,308 --> 02:27:01,139
Enjoy yourself

1572
02:27:08,150 --> 02:27:11,142
Fights, brawls, show of temper...

1573
02:27:11,220 --> 02:27:13,745
and proposing to girls
are things real men do

1574
02:27:15,324 --> 02:27:17,315
l'd rather you play
the guitar, Sameer

1575
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:53,752
Today's match is going to
be a terrific affair...

1576
02:28:53,856 --> 02:28:56,416
because, for the first time, we
haVe the lndian and Pakistani teams...

1577
02:28:56,492 --> 02:28:59,256
playing a friendly match in
this stadium in Goa today

1578
02:30:07,496 --> 02:30:09,327
Paa-ji's here!

1579
02:30:19,675 --> 02:30:21,336
Get out of the way!

1580
02:30:37,526 --> 02:30:39,357
Where do you think you're
going? Get out!

1581
02:30:59,448 --> 02:31:01,439
Who's that in the stadium?

1582
02:31:05,454 --> 02:31:07,547
He's grabbed the mike from Pa-ji

1583
02:31:07,623 --> 02:31:08,681
l'll...

1584
02:31:16,565 --> 02:31:17,725
Rani! Where are you?

1585
02:31:17,933 --> 02:31:21,460
He's come here, looking for Rani!

1586
02:31:24,006 --> 02:31:25,064
Who's Rani?

1587
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:27,404
What's he shouting Rani
for? Who's she?

1588
02:31:27,743 --> 02:31:30,405
lt has to do with the heart.
Keep it up, braVe lad!

1589
02:31:30,479 --> 02:31:31,912
Go for her!

1590
02:31:33,582 --> 02:31:35,413
Looks like it has to do with loVe

1591
02:31:37,586 --> 02:31:40,020
Rani... listen to me...

1592
02:31:40,422 --> 02:31:42,947
Where're you hiding, sis-in-law?
The boss is so upset!

1593
02:31:43,092 --> 02:31:46,220
He'll find her. He sure will.
- Sis-in-law!

1594
02:31:46,428 --> 02:31:48,419
Rani... where are you?

1595
02:32:04,780 --> 02:32:07,772
You mess with my mike?
You fight with me?

1596
02:32:09,652 --> 02:32:13,952
Rani! All l'll say is that
you mustn't marry Sunny!

1597
02:32:14,723 --> 02:32:18,056
He's not worthy of you! lt's
a question of your life!

1598
02:32:18,260 --> 02:32:19,625
Hold it, hold it...

1599
02:32:20,796 --> 02:32:24,630
he has something to say. Looks
like it has to do with loVe

1600
02:32:24,733 --> 02:32:26,462
Here you are

1601
02:32:41,984 --> 02:32:46,478
Rani, l'm not the sort
of guy you think l am

1602
02:32:47,990 --> 02:32:54,486
Yes, l made the mistake of keeping
my temper under control

1603
02:32:56,031 --> 02:32:59,000
Else, l'd haVe beaten Sunny black
and blue and throw him out of Goa

1604
02:33:01,670 --> 02:33:03,661
But Sunny's done a wonderful
thing today

1605
02:33:04,673 --> 02:33:06,664
He has stopped me from going away

1606
02:33:07,509 --> 02:33:09,841
There's something l want
to say to you, Rani

1607
02:33:10,045 --> 02:33:11,512
Rani...

1608
02:33:15,851 --> 02:33:17,512
l loVe you

1609
02:33:21,790 --> 02:33:26,523
l haVe loVed you eVer since
l first set eyes on you

1610
02:33:27,596 --> 02:33:31,191
Since the day the Colonel
started hating me

1611
02:33:32,267 --> 02:33:33,529
Colonel...

1612
02:33:35,938 --> 02:33:40,705
l'Ve made a lot of mistakes.
Please forgiVe me

1613
02:33:44,713 --> 02:33:47,341
Rani, if you're not
in loVe with me...

1614
02:33:52,721 --> 02:33:55,087
it's cool. l'll go away

1615
02:33:55,724 --> 02:34:01,356
But l haVe a feeling that you do

1616
02:34:02,731 --> 02:34:04,062
That you do loVe me

1617
02:34:05,968 --> 02:34:07,560
And thus, l publicly...

1618
02:34:08,737 --> 02:34:10,068
He's Very upset!

1619
02:34:10,739 --> 02:34:16,575
l'm not asking for too much. l
only want you to marry me...

1620
02:34:16,745 --> 02:34:19,179
so that we can haVe a family.
We can haVe kids...

1621
02:34:19,782 --> 02:34:25,379
who take after you in looks; eyes,
nose, lips, cheeks et al

1622
02:34:27,256 --> 02:34:29,781
l only want them to
haVe my surname...

1623
02:34:29,925 --> 02:34:34,089
because my dad had the
surname Malhotra

1624
02:34:36,999 --> 02:34:38,591
All l want to say to you is...

1625
02:34:43,138 --> 02:34:47,268
Ask her, Will you marry me?
- l'll marry you, if she doesn't!

1626
02:34:49,778 --> 02:34:50,938
Rani...

1627
02:34:52,414 --> 02:34:53,608
will you marry me?

1628
02:34:53,782 --> 02:34:55,613
Louder!

1629
02:34:58,787 --> 02:35:00,277
Will you marry me?

1630
02:35:00,689 --> 02:35:01,781
Can't hear you!

1631
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:13,631
Rani! Will you marry me?

1632
02:35:13,702 --> 02:35:15,636
Will you marry me...?

1633
02:35:24,813 --> 02:35:27,714
Say yes, sister-in-law.
- Please say yes!

1634
02:35:28,984 --> 02:35:33,148
Rani, l think he's the
right boy for you

1635
02:35:34,923 --> 02:35:40,156
He at least won't hit me
after he's married to you

1636
02:35:42,331 --> 02:35:44,822
Say yes, girl! Go on!

1637
02:35:44,933 --> 02:35:47,993
That's a spirited boy.
He's in loVe with you!

1638
02:35:48,203 --> 02:35:50,262
He's saying as much in
public. So say yes!

1639
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:01,072
Let the birds fly!

1640
02:36:01,850 --> 02:36:03,681
Say yes, sister-in-law!

1641
02:36:04,853 --> 02:36:06,411
Go on, my child. Go!

1642
02:36:27,109 --> 02:36:28,906
Our kids will take after
you in eyes and smile

1643
02:36:32,047 --> 02:36:34,106
And l like the surname Malhotra

1644
02:36:56,138 --> 02:36:57,730
Could l haVe the mike, please?

1645
02:36:59,241 --> 02:37:01,004
As my mother used to say...

1646
02:37:02,144 --> 02:37:04,271
anger is loVe's worst enemy

1647
02:37:05,247 --> 02:37:09,411
One who can't control his temper,
can't control anything in his lifetime

1648
02:37:09,918 --> 02:37:13,820
Sameer, my mother says, anger
is loVe's worst enemy

1649
02:37:13,956 --> 02:37:17,255
One who can't control his temper,
can't control anything in his lifetime

1650
02:37:17,359 --> 02:37:21,022
Not your mother! That's what my
friend Arun's mother used to say!

1651
02:37:21,930 --> 02:37:23,921
You remember what your
friend used to say

1652
02:37:24,032 --> 02:37:25,932
But you'Ve forgotten your friend?

1653
02:37:26,435 --> 02:37:29,927
You can't be Arun!
You're a scoundrel!

1654
02:37:30,272 --> 02:37:32,263
Arun was a gem of a guy!

1655
02:37:32,441 --> 02:37:36,935
Guess whose house l went to first,
on my return from America...

1656
02:37:37,012 --> 02:37:40,379
after 19 years? Yours!

1657
02:37:42,951 --> 02:37:46,318
Sameer's not here. Who are you?
- lt's me!

1658
02:37:47,122 --> 02:37:49,113
Sameer's childhood friend. Arun!

1659
02:37:51,960 --> 02:37:53,052
Good God!

1660
02:37:53,962 --> 02:37:56,123
Where's my buddy, grandma?
- He's away in Goa

1661
02:37:56,298 --> 02:37:59,131
ls he still as hot-tempered,
or has he calmed down?

1662
02:37:59,468 --> 02:38:03,131
His temper has got worse
with age, my son

1663
02:38:04,339 --> 02:38:06,807
Grandma then told me
about your problem...

1664
02:38:06,975 --> 02:38:11,207
how you had had a heart-break,
how you had gone away to Goa...

1665
02:38:11,279 --> 02:38:13,804
met Rani there and fallen
in loVe with her...

1666
02:38:14,149 --> 02:38:17,550
and how, for her sake, you
had suppressed your anger

1667
02:38:17,619 --> 02:38:20,281
Okay then. l'll go and phone Sameer

1668
02:38:20,355 --> 02:38:22,482
No, grandma. You won't
say a word to him

1669
02:38:22,991 --> 02:38:27,325
l'm going to treat him not as his
friend, but as his adVersary

1670
02:38:35,003 --> 02:38:37,028
That's how l landed in Goa...

1671
02:38:37,172 --> 02:38:40,505
to stay with your house,
in your room, with you!

1672
02:38:41,109 --> 02:38:45,170
l now know why you did this
all the time, buddy boy!

1673
02:38:46,048 --> 02:38:47,845
C'mon!

1674
02:38:55,524 --> 02:38:57,856
The insolent!
- Go topless

1675
02:39:01,463 --> 02:39:04,523
Those with iron pajamas...
- HaVe an ape for an Uncle!

1676
02:39:07,602 --> 02:39:11,129
Whose aunts are cats...
- HaVe dogs for friends!

1677
02:39:14,409 --> 02:39:17,037
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!

1678
02:39:17,279 --> 02:39:19,474
The insolent!
- Go topless

1679
02:39:20,048 --> 02:39:22,209
Those with iron pajamas!
- HaVe an ape for an Uncle!

1680
02:39:22,384 --> 02:39:25,046
Whose aunts are cats...
- HaVe dogs for friends!

1681
02:39:25,420 --> 02:39:28,048
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!

1682
02:39:39,301 --> 02:39:41,064
What happened?

1683
02:39:41,570 --> 02:39:42,901
What's up now?

1684
02:39:43,071 --> 02:39:44,902
All oVer again!

1685
02:39:45,173 --> 02:39:48,700
What wrong haVe l done now?
- You're ill-fated, son

1686
02:39:49,311 --> 02:39:53,304
l'm jinxed! But nothing
can go wrong now

1687
02:39:57,085 --> 02:40:02,318
The poor chap's been suffering
all this while

1688
02:40:04,092 --> 02:40:10,190
For your sake, he has
remained a bachelor

1689
02:40:11,933 --> 02:40:18,429
You shall now become his bride...

1690
02:40:21,109 --> 02:40:22,940
marry him

1691
02:40:24,212 --> 02:40:26,544

1692
02:40:35,624 --> 02:40:39,560
lt seemed as if this
chap was my tormentor

1693
02:40:39,961 --> 02:40:43,226
But he's the one who has
shown me the right path

1694
02:40:43,365 --> 02:40:48,632
HoweVer, you are the one
who shall become my bride

1695
02:40:49,037 --> 02:40:51,972
You must become his sister-in-law...

1696
02:40:52,641 --> 02:40:55,041
you must marry me
