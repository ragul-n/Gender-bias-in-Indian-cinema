1
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,489
The notorious murderer,
Durjan Singh...

2
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:21,765
...whom the police wants dead
or alive, is in this building.

3
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:28,966
The problem is that he's taken
5-6 building workers as hostage.

4
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:52,259
Yes, this is Durjan.

5
00:03:52,897 --> 00:03:55,525
Who are you?
- I am...

6
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:57,632
DSP Shiv Kumar.

7
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:03,771
The police has surrounded
this building on all sides.

8
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:07,709
It's impossible for you to leave.

9
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:14,073
Sir, feed this trash to others.

10
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,880
If I get annoyed, I'll chuck
their corpses out the window!

11
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:24,622
Understood?

12
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,995
I'm going in.

13
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:36,198
You know the kind
of killer he is.

14
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,030
Do as I say.

15
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,902
Switch on all the search lights
and aim them at the window.

16
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:45,907
The light will blind
him momentarily...

17
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,977
And I'll go across.

18
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,582
Got it?

19
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:55,453
What's going on?

20
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,780
What trick is this?

21
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:45,860
I see.

22
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:51,890
Take him away.

23
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:08,878
Dad's scared!

24
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,211
You always scare Daddy.

25
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:16,309
Frighten your mummy sometimes.

26
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:18,615
Where is she?

27
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:32,393
Will you have tea?

28
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,935
I asked if you'll have some tea.

29
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:42,538
Sure. We both were coming
slyly to frighten you.

30
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:44,411
How did you see us?

31
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:50,678
Look at that mirror.
I could see both of you clearly.

32
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:54,718
Very good! After all you
are a police officer's wife!

33
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,359
Dear doll, our scheme failed.

34
00:10:00,998 --> 00:10:04,263
Never mind. We'll try again.

35
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:06,664
- Stand straight.
- What's this?

36
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:09,501
You've already started knitting.

37
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:13,304
It's one with full-sleeves
and you know my speed.

38
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,869
Winter will be here by then.

39
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:17,644
Change your clothes.
I'll get some tea.

40
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:20,944
Start packing.

41
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:25,616
My transfer orders have arrived.
We're going to Bombay.

42
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:27,785
I'm afraid of your transfers.

43
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:33,319
But if it's Bombay, it's okay.
Vijay and Ravi will stay with us.

44
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:35,898
Whether they stay
with us or not...

45
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:39,358
If they haven't changed
their ways...

46
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,534
as long as I'm in Bombay,
they'll stay in lock up, in jail!

47
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:50,337
You talk about your brothers
as if they were criminals!

48
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:53,280
So what if they are
a bit mischievous?

49
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:59,880
That's what my parents said.
And their indulgence spoilt them.

50
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:07,386
And the poor things
departed, saying this.

51
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:09,859
But my brothers never changed.

52
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:13,801
Is this the hotel?

53
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,206
You think the hotel manager
will get taken in by us?

54
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:24,376
I don't play for nothing.
I've made inquiries.

55
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:30,117
The hotel manager is a very
corrupt and greedy man.

56
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:33,189
You'll see how he gets taken in.

57
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:51,737
Can I get a room?

58
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,642
What kind of a room?

59
00:11:57,281 --> 00:12:01,342
I asked if you want a
single room or double...

60
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:07,783
- Name?
- Name? Why?

61
00:12:08,258 --> 00:12:10,726
Your name has to be
entered in our register.

62
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,339
Sign here.

63
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:34,848
The key to your room. 102.

64
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:37,512
I'll send the bag upstairs.

65
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:41,517
No, thanks.
- Why bother? The bearer will take it

66
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,119
I'll carry it myself.
- Your wish, sir.

67
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:48,497
How do I go to the room?

68
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:54,226
Go upstairs, that way.
Room number 102 is to the left.

69
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:55,699
Thanks.

70
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:07,911
Yes?

71
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:11,644
Are you the hotel manager?

72
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:15,682
Yes, but what's the matter?

73
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,928
A man used to work for Jamnadas
a famous jeweler in these parts.

74
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,960
He has escaped with 250,000
worth of his diamonds!

75
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:28,032
Worth 250,000!

76
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:35,002
And according to our information,
he's hiding in some hotel here.

77
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,843
With 250,000
worth of diamonds?

78
00:13:39,015 --> 00:13:40,414
This is his picture.

79
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,214
Did this man ever come here?

80
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,784
This man? In our hotel?
No way! Never!

81
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,993
Sir, I've never seen
a man like him.

82
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:58,401
Will any man come to this
ordinary hotel with 250,000?

83
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:00,498
Just think about it.

84
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:03,967
Fine. That's all
I wanted to know.

85
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:05,934
Please inform us if
you see him around.

86
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:19,815
Yes?

87
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,250
May I come in?

88
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:26,462
In? What for?

89
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,958
Somebody came here
looking for you.

90
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:33,835
Lies!

91
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,128
Who?

92
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:40,637
What's the matter?
- You can fool the cops.

93
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:43,003
But you can't fool me.

94
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,348
I know the truth about you.

95
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:47,945
The police are looking
for you all over

96
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:51,482
One word from me,
and you'll be behind bars!

97
00:14:52,055 --> 00:14:54,216
What are you saying?

98
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,757
Don't try to act innocent.

99
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:02,860
Your welfare lies in
giving the diamonds to me.

100
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:06,292
Diamonds? Who?

101
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,369
You're trying to fool me?

102
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:16,677
I'm talking about the diamonds
you stole from Jamnadas Jewelers.

103
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:18,605
And kept in this suitcase!

104
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:31,449
If you know everything, fine.

105
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:36,393
Now you're on the right path.

106
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,427
But... but...

107
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:48,904
lf... if you...
I too should have a share.

108
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:53,808
If you take all the diamonds and
I get nothing, I'll go to the police

109
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,042
I'll go to prison.

110
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,920
I'll also name you.

111
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:05,690
Think it over.

112
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:08,421
You've turned out to be
a really smart chap.

113
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,532
Look pal, give me the diamonds.

114
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:18,636
I'll save you from the police
and help you to escape.

115
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:23,502
You want money?
I'll give you 10000.

116
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:28,877
10000? Diamonds worth
250,000 for 10000?

117
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:32,449
Don't act smart with me.

118
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:35,618
Will you do as I say or
should I call the police?

119
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:40,761
Wait. I accept.

120
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:43,999
First the diamonds.

121
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:55,000
Worth 250,000!

122
00:16:55,445 --> 00:17:00,314
Now arrange for me to leave.

123
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:06,020
The police van is waiting
for both of you downstairs.

124
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:10,456
You had left...
But good you returned!

125
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,663
Arrest him! He's the man who
was running with these diamonds!

126
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:20,230
Keep your diamonds!
You stole them!

127
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,695
Am I right, sir?
- Quiet!

128
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:24,771
I've heard everything.

129
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,369
Hand the diamonds over to me.

130
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,336
Also the money.

131
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:36,082
Stealing is a crime.
Helping a robber is a crime.

132
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:42,221
Buying stolen goods is a crime.
Now you'll grind grain in jail.

133
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:45,352
Forgive me.

134
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:47,956
I can do nothing. Come on.

135
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:53,092
But we can do something for you.

136
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:57,465
Free us and keep the diamonds.

137
00:17:57,974 --> 00:18:04,675
To top it all... If he can give
a thief like you 10000...

138
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:09,609
Such a great police officer...
I mean...

139
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:14,556
Yes! Take 15000 but spare me!

140
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:20,521
Are you trying to bribe me?

141
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:24,264
It's not a bribe, it's for your
children; buy them some sweets.

142
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:27,635
Cakes, pastries...
- You shut up!

143
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:30,802
You don't even know how
to talk to big officers!

144
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:36,843
Here's another 5000. That makes
it 15000. And spare me, sir.

145
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:48,690
All right but... don't ever
do such an illegal thing again!

146
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,687
You come with me.

147
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:57,294
Yes, sir. Take him away.
He steals and traps decent folks!

148
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:23,687
What a beauty!
- It's terrific.

149
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:29,491
What gait!
- As if she's floating in the air.

150
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,232
Looks like a new model.
In A 1 condition.

151
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,200
Yes, very good condition.

152
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:43,103
How do you find the color?
- I wish it never fades.

153
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:47,413
Must drive it carefully.

154
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:51,019
Yes, very carefully.

155
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,878
Great body...
Do you see the shape?

156
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:57,956
That's what I'm looking at!

157
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:01,956
One thing is certain.
It must be expensive

158
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:06,902
Priceless.
- It will never get spoilt.

159
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,431
Once you get it,
you're made for life!

160
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:12,865
Doubtless. Very comfortable.

161
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:17,743
Did you see her enter?
- Yes, she came in an imported car.

162
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:22,714
Imported car? Who came in it?

163
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:27,989
That's what... She!
- You're funny!

164
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:30,417
I'm talking of the car,
and you're talking trash!

165
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:35,561
This is trash? You have a chest in
your stone instead of a heart!

166
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:38,367
One has a heart in the chest
not chest in the heart!

167
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:41,066
Whatever! I'm not operating.

168
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:45,130
You find legal points in all...
- No!

169
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:46,408
I want the full sum.

170
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:49,071
Give me some time.

171
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:50,977
I'll pay everything.

172
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:55,542
I give loans, not time.

173
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:59,182
Find another businessman
if you need more time.

174
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:03,183
Give me my money and 3% interest.

175
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:06,725
You'll get your money.
I give you my word.

176
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:10,189
I have my own words.
And they serve me well.

177
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:15,363
What will I do with your words?
I want my money, not your words.

178
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:20,342
Wait. How much do I owe you?
- Thirty thousand.

179
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:27,339
That's my car.
It costs more than 30000.

180
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:34,717
I don't have the money now.
Take my car instead of the money.

181
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:43,189
This car must cost
at least 100,000.

182
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:47,294
No! This is wrong.

183
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:50,773
You sit in your car.
Give me my money

184
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:54,677
Fine. I'll sell it.

185
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:58,670
There's some difference
between a car and vegetables.

186
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:01,378
I can't sell it on the road.

187
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:05,079
Give me 2 days to sell it...
- No!

188
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:07,921
Time's out of stock today.

189
00:22:08,658 --> 00:22:11,320
I want my money now,
or you go to prison!

190
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:15,527
Very sad.
- Very sad.

191
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:22,293
Very good! This is like,
who are you and what's your job?

192
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:23,902
Let us discuss business.

193
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,901
We've come to discuss business.

194
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:30,709
Who are you?

195
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:36,482
Think of us as your friends,
sharing your pain.

196
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,219
May we sit here for 2 minutes?

197
00:22:38,554 --> 00:22:39,782
Sure.
- Thanks.

198
00:22:42,392 --> 00:22:46,726
How much does she owe you?

199
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:52,795
You talk as if you'll keep
the notes on the table!

200
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:01,402
Great! Genuine notes.

201
00:23:02,812 --> 00:23:07,078
I don't know you.
I don't understand anything.

202
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:09,282
My name is Ravi. He's Vijay.

203
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:14,020
We were sitting at the next table.
The way he was threatening you...

204
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,724
I couldn't take it.
- You want to sell this car.

205
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:22,628
We're ready to buy it
to help you.

206
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:24,556
Only to help you.

207
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:27,126
We don't need this car.

208
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:35,206
Very good! Who says there's
no humanity in this world?

209
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:38,975
How much is this?
- Thirty thousand.

210
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:42,947
Must be, but I'll count it
if you want me to.

211
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:48,922
You've obliged me
by buying this car.

212
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:51,924
You're embarrassing me.

213
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:55,423
Man helps man after all.

214
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:57,562
The car keys.
- Here.

215
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:01,764
Strange co-incidence, that we met.

216
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:06,642
I think God has sent you
to help me.

217
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:09,671
He didn't, we came on our own.

218
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:13,880
The car papers.
- Come home and collect them.

219
00:24:14,283 --> 00:24:16,012
This is my card.

220
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:25,152
That's my name.

221
00:24:25,695 --> 00:24:28,255
Beautiful name.

222
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,928
30000 exactly. Made me count it
for nothing. I knew it.

223
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:35,564
Got your money?
- Absolutely.

224
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:38,566
If you ever need money,
I'm not dead.

225
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:42,534
You guys keep my card.

226
00:24:43,513 --> 00:24:45,037
You may leave.

227
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:54,088
I wish to thank you
again before I leave.

228
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:57,756
One thing is sure, the moment
you sit in the car you'll know...

229
00:24:58,194 --> 00:25:03,757
It's not a bad deal.
I'll wait for you at tea.

230
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,539
That's a smart girl.

231
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:19,145
The girl's smart, but
the car isn't bad either.

232
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:31,486
What pick-up!

233
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:34,659
Press the accelerator
and it talks to the winds!

234
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:37,866
Talks to the winds?
What does it say?

235
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:42,066
I didn't hear it.
- It is said.

236
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:43,402
It's a phrase.

237
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:48,704
That's the police
talking to the wind.

238
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:54,277
God knows which poor soul
is in trouble today!

239
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:14,994
Come on out.

240
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:18,436
We were driving very slowly.

241
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:21,303
I said, come out.

242
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:24,845
But what's the matter?

243
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:33,252
Both of you are under arrest
for stealing this car!

244
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:38,657
But Pushpa Bhargava
herself gave us this car.

245
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:42,920
Shut up! This isn't
Pushpa Bhargava's car.

246
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:47,799
The owner is Maneklal Mehta!
It was stolen yesterday.

247
00:26:49,071 --> 00:26:52,472
But we just bought it
for 30000 cash!

248
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:56,578
So you bought it, eh?

249
00:26:56,979 --> 00:27:00,915
Come to the police station.
I'll give you a receipt.

250
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:17,256
Do you understand?

251
00:27:19,402 --> 00:27:22,565
The girl has conned us.

252
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:27,339
I understand.
- It wasn't her car.

253
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:34,375
Pushpa Bhargava is not her name.

254
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,615
Understood.

255
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:42,920
Right now, that man and the girl
are sitting somewhere.

256
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:44,818
Splitting 15000 each.

257
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:46,818
Understood.

258
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:52,325
And we've lost 30000.

259
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:54,465
And are in prison.

260
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,963
Understood.
- What?

261
00:27:58,107 --> 00:28:03,977
We have to get out of here
and sort them out.

262
00:28:04,447 --> 00:28:07,109
We'll be released some time.

263
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:10,750
But how will we find them?

264
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:14,855
Only one man can find them.

265
00:32:38,787 --> 00:32:41,585
We need to locate a girl
and a middle-aged man.

266
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:43,890
She fooled us.

267
00:32:45,461 --> 00:32:47,691
We don't know the name.

268
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:52,299
But the man had
a cleft in his chin.

269
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:55,000
And the girl...
- Was very pretty.

270
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:59,107
Large eyes, long hair.

271
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:02,239
Fair cheeks, she spoke like...

272
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:06,140
You're thinking of the girl's
beauty when we've lost 30000!

273
00:33:07,016 --> 00:33:08,847
30000?
- Yes.

274
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:14,388
The girl and her partner set
a trap and gave us a stolen car!

275
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,626
Was this somewhere
near Khar or Bandra?

276
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,362
Yes, exactly!

277
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,459
Do you know them?

278
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:31,129
Stop playing this and tell
us where we'll find them.

279
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:34,908
I'll teach them
such a lesson...

280
00:33:35,778 --> 00:33:36,802
Acting pricey.

281
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:42,248
See that machine?
Know what it is?

282
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:44,048
It's a public telephone.

283
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:51,423
Dial a number, but till you
put in a coin, you aren't heard.

284
00:33:52,294 --> 00:33:55,695
What are you guys saying?
I can't hear a word!

285
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:02,395
Here you are.

286
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,266
Now what are you thinking?

287
00:34:07,676 --> 00:34:11,043
I'm thinking whom will
this poor guy talk to?

288
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:15,380
Here.

289
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:19,719
The girl is Renu.

290
00:34:20,255 --> 00:34:21,745
The man is her uncle.

291
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:26,051
Both of them keep pulling
these tricks in that area.

292
00:34:27,029 --> 00:34:32,057
- Her uncle.
- Yes.

293
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:34,234
Where will I find them?

294
00:34:39,942 --> 00:34:44,538
Niece, what you do
all day is fine.

295
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:50,078
But this canon you fire
will sink my heart someday.

296
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,221
I don't like sitting idle.
Think of a scheme.

297
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:59,951
I'm not reading the newspaper
for the weather report.

298
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:02,320
I'm looking for ideas.

299
00:35:09,038 --> 00:35:11,563
Run!

300
00:35:12,307 --> 00:35:14,502
Good God!

301
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:17,639
- Catch them!
- You, that way!

302
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:35,352
Rascals! Dropped my oranges!

303
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:55,848
Don't you try to run!

304
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,879
Who can run, that we should try!

305
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:02,081
- Our money!
- 30000. All of it.

306
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,449
- What money?
- Don't act smart.

307
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:06,124
One slap and you'll
recall everything!

308
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:10,289
No slaps. You can
abuse me if you want.

309
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:17,594
Let go of my collar. You'll be
in trouble if I lose my head!

310
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:21,276
Leave him alone.
You'll get your money.

311
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:28,007
This party seems crooked.

312
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:31,413
Why get into trouble?
Give the money.

313
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,381
Yes. I feel they need it more.

314
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,226
So I'll pay them.

315
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:43,662
Here. 25000.

316
00:36:44,032 --> 00:36:46,262
- The rest?
- We blew it up.

317
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:50,761
You're touching me again.
Talk from far.

318
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:54,499
I'll give you one!

319
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,542
I don't have 5000.

320
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,641
The day we have it,
we'll pay you.

321
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:02,310
Tell this to another.

322
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:05,182
I knew you well.

323
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:08,212
I knew you well.
We know all about you.

324
00:37:11,794 --> 00:37:15,821
That's what I was saying.
Why fight amongst ourselves.

325
00:37:16,165 --> 00:37:19,293
We're birds of a feather.

326
00:37:19,701 --> 00:37:23,137
We'll share and peck
at the grains.

327
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:26,635
I have a great plan,
if it suits you.

328
00:37:27,176 --> 00:37:30,202
Keep your ideas to yourself
and pay us our money!

329
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:35,241
One moment. Those who con us
have to have some talent.

330
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:39,585
- Let's hear the idea.
- Forget it.

331
00:37:39,988 --> 00:37:42,821
Just hear it. Don't be fussy.

332
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:48,662
Today's paper says, next Sunday,
at the Hotel Sheet Mahal...

333
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:52,797
the princess of Kamalpur,
is throwing a grand party.

334
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:57,427
The necklace she'll be wearing
has diamonds worth millions.

335
00:37:57,873 --> 00:38:02,333
If we get together... 50-50;
fine?

336
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:04,336
Our 5000 is separate.

337
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:06,940
He's still stuck there.

338
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:09,976
That's different.

339
00:44:37,572 --> 00:44:40,336
Princess, your necklace?

340
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:43,768
My necklace!

341
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:51,479
- Somebody stole her necklace!
- Princess!

342
00:44:56,925 --> 00:44:59,758
- Did you...
- No.

343
00:45:02,864 --> 00:45:04,422
- Did you?
- No.

344
00:45:07,068 --> 00:45:09,366
- Did you...
- No.

345
00:45:10,305 --> 00:45:11,932
Did you...

346
00:45:13,508 --> 00:45:19,538
We're sorry about what happened,
which wasn't very nice.

347
00:45:19,948 --> 00:45:24,681
But now we'll have to call in
the police and search everybody.

348
00:45:25,153 --> 00:45:28,919
Don't feel offended. It's a
matter of prestige for our hotel.

349
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:34,661
So I request all of you to remain in
your places till the police arrive.

350
00:45:48,243 --> 00:45:50,837
Looks like somebody beat us to it.

351
00:45:51,246 --> 00:45:53,612
It'll be tough to take it out.

352
00:45:54,015 --> 00:45:58,179
Why are you worried? We came
with nothing and we'll go that way.

353
00:45:58,553 --> 00:45:59,884
Let them search us.
What, Vijay?

354
00:46:22,143 --> 00:46:24,771
You may go. Come here.

355
00:46:30,085 --> 00:46:32,451
Go. You next.

356
00:46:43,965 --> 00:46:46,126
You too may leave.

357
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:19,861
What are you thinking about?

358
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:23,868
I'm thinking whether to praise
your voice or your hands...

359
00:47:24,873 --> 00:47:28,206
Whether I praise your
song or your style.

360
00:47:29,577 --> 00:47:33,411
My victory or your loss?

361
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:40,888
The question is where
did the necklace vanish?

362
00:47:41,389 --> 00:47:48,420
The question is, is my pocket your
bank locket where you can put jewels?

363
00:47:50,098 --> 00:47:55,502
The fact is... I was scared.

364
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:57,763
I respect your fear.

365
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,098
There were others who had pockets.
Why did you pick on me?

366
00:48:03,244 --> 00:48:08,648
You never considered what'd happen
to me if I was caught with it.

367
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,748
I would be wandering scared
in the jail compound.

368
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:17,854
Anyway, why discuss
what did not occur.

369
00:48:18,326 --> 00:48:22,285
We must talk of what happened.
And what did happen is this.

370
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:28,066
An expensive necklace fell in my
pocket from your pretty hands.

371
00:48:28,536 --> 00:48:32,063
And the question bothering
you now must be...

372
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:37,470
After it came to my pocket,
did the earth swallow it?

373
00:48:37,812 --> 00:48:40,713
Or did the skies?

374
00:48:41,015 --> 00:48:45,679
But it's nothing of the sort.
It's between the earth and sky.

375
00:48:46,254 --> 00:48:47,881
Look here.

376
00:48:50,658 --> 00:48:52,853
You are truly fantastic!

377
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:57,522
- Hats off to you.
- Hats off to you too.

378
00:48:57,866 --> 00:49:02,428
Because many had their eyes
on it but you got hold of it.

379
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:05,662
I respect such artists.

380
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,476
You too have a share in it.

381
00:49:12,814 --> 00:49:14,145
- No, madam.
- Not madam.

382
00:49:16,117 --> 00:49:27,392
No, because there are 3 others,
excluding us, as partners to this.

383
00:49:27,996 --> 00:49:30,988
I don't know what you
feel hearing this siren...

384
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:34,860
But my blood pressure
is mounting.

385
00:49:35,336 --> 00:49:39,272
Because my experience says,
they are following us.

386
00:49:39,707 --> 00:49:42,039
This is the time to
look forward, not back.

387
00:49:42,343 --> 00:49:43,901
Run!

388
00:50:53,815 --> 00:50:56,613
That's the end of the news.

389
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:03,423
You've got us worried.
How far you made us come!

390
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:10,629
- Were you chasing us?
- How strange!

391
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:13,024
Didn't you hear our siren?

392
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:21,501
- We were so lost in our talks...
- Yes.

393
00:51:22,176 --> 00:51:28,012
- What's the matter?
- The car you're in is not yours.

394
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:32,545
Not our car?

395
00:51:33,955 --> 00:51:41,361
But how did this happen?

396
00:51:41,763 --> 00:51:49,033
That's because the car parked
next to yours was of the same model.

397
00:51:49,704 --> 00:51:52,571
And you took this instead.

398
00:51:54,442 --> 00:52:05,285
So this was the reason you...

399
00:52:05,553 --> 00:52:06,281
Yes.

400
00:52:06,587 --> 00:52:11,615
Forgive us. We were so lost...

401
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,119
- We never made such a mistake.
- Yes.

402
00:52:14,562 --> 00:52:17,463
- Yes?
- Your name?

403
00:52:23,371 --> 00:52:27,102
I can understand that there
can be two similar cars.

404
00:52:27,475 --> 00:52:28,874
One could be mistaken.

405
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:32,839
But I can't believe
you didn't hear our siren.

406
00:52:33,214 --> 00:52:34,579
Yet kept speeding.

407
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:37,607
May I know the reason for it?

408
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:42,389
So you have caught us?

409
00:52:43,558 --> 00:52:49,019
There's no point in lying.
We must tell him the truth.

410
00:52:49,464 --> 00:52:52,297
No, there's no other way.

411
00:52:58,473 --> 00:53:03,501
The truth is Sunita's father...

412
00:53:04,212 --> 00:53:10,617
...wants to marry her off
for money

413
00:53:10,918 --> 00:53:13,148
To Phoolchand's son Gulabchand.

414
00:53:13,788 --> 00:53:16,086
By force, and against her wishes.

415
00:53:16,524 --> 00:53:17,923
He has no right to do so.

416
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:21,851
She is an adult.

417
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,130
She can take her own decisions.

418
00:53:24,866 --> 00:53:33,865
Lala Kirodimal and Phoolchand have
put up a wall of wealth between us.

419
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:41,307
Today we were going to break that
wall and be united in holy matrimony.

420
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:47,851
We were afraid, Kirodimal and
Phoolchand would set the cops after us.

421
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:53,388
And have us separated.
And so we... we...

422
00:53:53,628 --> 00:53:55,493
- Yes.
- Look, Miss.

423
00:53:55,963 --> 00:54:00,366
You are educated, sensible
and an adult by law.

424
00:54:00,768 --> 00:54:04,499
If you want to get married,
nobody can stop you.

425
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:07,101
This sinful society!

426
00:54:07,675 --> 00:54:11,441
Nobody can stop you
from getting married.

427
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,211
Only be careful of one thing.

428
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:16,981
Just as you assume others
cars to be your own...

429
00:54:17,451 --> 00:54:22,150
don't make this mistake in the
case of wives after you're married.

430
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:28,155
What? If I make this mistake,
may I be punished like a thief.

431
00:54:28,629 --> 00:54:29,891
We'll take this car.

432
00:54:30,231 --> 00:54:31,858
Collect your car from the hotel.

433
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:39,703
Thank you very much.

434
00:54:50,751 --> 00:54:51,877
What are you thinking of?

435
00:54:54,522 --> 00:55:00,722
I'm thinking why we didn't meet
despite living in the same city.

436
00:55:02,697 --> 00:55:05,461
There's an old saying.

437
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:08,232
Things happens when...

438
00:55:08,703 --> 00:55:11,866
they are supposed to happen.

439
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:19,580
I think all that happened
today was not at all bad.

440
00:55:22,483 --> 00:55:25,043
It's between us.

441
00:55:25,853 --> 00:55:30,119
I have the same feelings
on this issue.

442
01:01:19,306 --> 01:01:22,537
- Come on.
- Fast.

443
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:26,370
Stop!

444
01:01:28,616 --> 01:01:32,484
- Brother!
- No, a police officer.

445
01:01:32,853 --> 01:01:37,688
I've come to arrest you in
a case of fraud and cheating.

446
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:49,133
What times we live in! Forget me,
both of you are his real brothers.

447
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:50,960
He's locked you in.

448
01:01:51,538 --> 01:01:54,871
Somebody rightfully said,
one can't even trust brothers.

449
01:01:55,276 --> 01:01:57,642
What are you saying?
It's not that.

450
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:05,549
If we do a fraud, will a decent
police officer like him spare us?

451
01:02:05,986 --> 01:02:07,248
What men you are!

452
01:02:07,655 --> 01:02:10,920
Standing up for the man
who locked you up!

453
01:02:11,258 --> 01:02:14,625
- Sister-in-law!
- Now what's that?

454
01:02:23,137 --> 01:02:26,072
Come here, both of you!

455
01:02:29,276 --> 01:02:32,211
First listen to us.

456
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,277
- Please...
- No, first listen to me.

457
01:02:36,817 --> 01:02:39,513
What had happened. We agree
we made a mistake but...

458
01:02:40,054 --> 01:02:43,512
We were just joking and
the matter became serious.

459
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:47,127
We thought of fooling people.

460
01:02:48,162 --> 01:02:49,789
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

461
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:52,598
It was just... we didn't know...

462
01:03:03,944 --> 01:03:07,209
Forgive us.

463
01:03:09,249 --> 01:03:13,982
You haven't eaten food
cooked by me for many days.

464
01:03:15,356 --> 01:03:18,325
- But...
- I've taken permission.

465
01:03:19,026 --> 01:03:23,895
For many months, we'll
have to eat prison food...

466
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:31,970
It's so sad. The men whose brother
is an honest, upright man...

467
01:03:32,473 --> 01:03:34,498
They are caught doing such jobs.

468
01:03:35,309 --> 01:03:39,803
You can't even imagine
how much he loves you.

469
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:47,320
Much before being a father,
a husband and a brother...

470
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:49,679
He's a police officer.

471
01:03:50,124 --> 01:03:54,993
Who will stake
anything for the law.

472
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,308
Run!

473
01:04:24,525 --> 01:04:25,617
What?

474
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:31,765
All right.

475
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:35,096
What's wrong?

476
01:04:37,905 --> 01:04:43,434
Our boats, all our stuff...
was seized by the police.

477
01:04:46,146 --> 01:04:48,137
- The same officer?
- Yes.

478
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:53,910
The problem is
if Shakal finds out...

479
01:04:55,422 --> 01:04:56,912
I don't know what to do.

480
01:04:57,858 --> 01:05:01,350
But we'll have to tell him.

481
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:06,793
That I know.
But who will tell him?

482
01:05:08,836 --> 01:05:12,203
I think all of us should go.

483
01:07:28,909 --> 01:07:33,369
We wanted to give you some news.

484
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:46,020
I know.

485
01:08:00,374 --> 01:08:02,740
You guys think...

486
01:08:03,677 --> 01:08:07,272
You can give me some news...

487
01:08:08,749 --> 01:08:12,116
that I'm not aware of.

488
01:08:13,754 --> 01:08:18,714
But today I'll show you something...

489
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:22,660
...l'll tell you something.

490
01:08:22,996 --> 01:08:26,693
That you would have
neither heard nor seen.

491
01:08:27,634 --> 01:08:31,730
First of all...
this was no coincidence.

492
01:08:32,105 --> 01:08:38,704
That officer Shiv Kumar
confiscated our goods worth millions.

493
01:08:39,112 --> 01:08:43,549
In fact, one of our men
gave him this information.

494
01:08:45,652 --> 01:08:47,244
One of our men?

495
01:08:47,654 --> 01:08:51,715
One of our men.

496
01:08:53,627 --> 01:09:00,465
Anyway, what has happened
has happened.

497
01:09:03,904 --> 01:09:06,065
This is my new hobby.

498
01:09:08,608 --> 01:09:12,738
My new toy.

499
01:09:25,525 --> 01:09:27,117
Didn't get it?

500
01:09:28,528 --> 01:09:30,257
You'll understand.

501
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:52,817
Now watch the game of this toy.

502
01:10:17,778 --> 01:10:20,269
Strange animal.

503
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,274
It stays hungry, no matter
how much it eats.

504
01:10:30,957 --> 01:10:38,762
Why? Don't you like the game?

505
01:10:42,469 --> 01:10:46,530
Anyway, we were talking
about that man...

506
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:51,138
...who informed the police
about my goods.

507
01:10:52,245 --> 01:10:56,682
I know who he is.

508
01:11:04,424 --> 01:11:08,724
- Do you know him?
- Very well.

509
01:11:10,697 --> 01:11:17,068
He is one of you.

510
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:21,438
What?

511
01:11:22,075 --> 01:11:24,771
Yes.

512
01:11:27,814 --> 01:11:29,839
One of you.

513
01:11:35,722 --> 01:11:37,952
You assume rightly.

514
01:11:41,628 --> 01:11:46,725
There's a button here
for every chair.

515
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:54,997
The moment I use it, that man
becomes the hungry crocodile's meal.

516
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:03,112
Who is that man?

517
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:04,508
It can be you.

518
01:12:08,722 --> 01:12:12,385
- It can be you.
- No!

519
01:12:13,426 --> 01:12:17,192
Or you.

520
01:12:20,033 --> 01:12:23,594
Or you?

521
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:32,038
In a little while, the
other three will know...

522
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:36,542
who the traitor is.

523
01:12:36,883 --> 01:12:38,908
Because pieces of his body...

524
01:12:39,486 --> 01:12:44,890
...will be in the crocodile's
hungry and sharp teeth!

525
01:13:29,903 --> 01:13:34,567
No sir! No! Forgive me!

526
01:13:36,509 --> 01:13:39,137
I'll never do it again!

527
01:13:58,398 --> 01:14:02,664
- Where shall we go?
- On the giant wheel.

528
01:16:31,484 --> 01:16:33,816
There he is!

529
01:17:09,656 --> 01:17:11,351
Permit us to leave.

530
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:13,725
We'll never return.

531
01:17:14,127 --> 01:17:18,291
Yes, the sooner one moves away
from jail the better it is.

532
01:17:18,798 --> 01:17:19,890
They might change their mind.

533
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:28,804
Let's take an oath at
these tall prison walls.

534
01:17:29,142 --> 01:17:30,905
After today, we'll do nothing...

535
01:17:31,477 --> 01:17:34,207
which will send us that
side of the walls again.

536
01:17:34,714 --> 01:17:38,673
It's too much. We must
lead a decent life now.

537
01:17:39,118 --> 01:17:43,919
- Noble intention.
- Brother?

538
01:17:45,892 --> 01:17:49,453
Today you can call me brother.

539
01:17:49,862 --> 01:17:53,593
Because that day, a police
officer arrested you.

540
01:17:54,067 --> 01:18:00,529
But today, a brother awaits his
siblings outside these walls.

541
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:04,169
We are ashamed.

542
01:18:04,877 --> 01:18:10,281
Forgive us. We know we have
caused you a lot of pain.

543
01:18:10,984 --> 01:18:13,953
There's no question of
my forgiving you or not.

544
01:18:14,887 --> 01:18:17,219
You've been punished
for your deeds.

545
01:18:17,757 --> 01:18:20,920
As a brother, I can only hope...

546
01:18:21,361 --> 01:18:27,197
that you will now give up
this life of irresponsibility.

547
01:18:27,567 --> 01:18:28,659
Take the good path.

548
01:18:29,269 --> 01:18:31,897
Believe us, now it will happen.

549
01:18:36,576 --> 01:18:37,304
Let's go home.

550
01:18:38,378 --> 01:18:42,007
How do we face her?

551
01:18:42,582 --> 01:18:45,983
She won't say anything to you.

552
01:18:46,452 --> 01:18:48,920
Today is a special day for her.

553
01:18:49,255 --> 01:18:52,418
- Today is our wedding anniversary.
- Today is your wedding anniversary?

554
01:18:52,692 --> 01:18:56,355
Enough. Then we'll come as if...

555
01:20:56,082 --> 01:20:57,344
What do you mean?

556
01:20:57,984 --> 01:21:00,077
I must apologize to the smugglers!

557
01:21:00,586 --> 01:21:03,680
To save my life, I quit
this job like a coward!

558
01:21:04,023 --> 01:21:07,789
It's not always a matter
of bravery or cowardice.

559
01:21:08,227 --> 01:21:12,630
- It's also of responsibility.
- We don't mean duty has no meaning.

560
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,327
Is it all right to put your
life in danger for duty?

561
01:21:17,503 --> 01:21:21,701
If Vijay or I faced
the same situation...

562
01:21:22,275 --> 01:21:26,541
It's fine but you have to think
about your wife and daughter.

563
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:31,440
Right. You are both right.

564
01:21:32,485 --> 01:21:34,817
I'll quit my job.

565
01:21:36,222 --> 01:21:38,986
But have you ever thought...

566
01:21:39,559 --> 01:21:44,087
The police officer
who will replace me...

567
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:47,433
he too will have a wife.
He too may have kids.

568
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,836
If every police officer in the
world thinks about his own safety...

569
01:21:52,171 --> 01:21:54,105
there'll be no law.

570
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:58,167
We only meant... why don't
you explain to brother?

571
01:21:59,178 --> 01:22:01,203
He never listens to me.

572
01:22:01,848 --> 01:22:04,009
I've said the same
things a million times.

573
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:05,510
As if he'd listen!

574
01:22:06,118 --> 01:22:09,087
You're all making a
mountain out of a mole hill!

575
01:22:09,422 --> 01:22:11,754
So far nothing has
happened to me.

576
01:22:12,191 --> 01:22:14,489
Even if something does,
what's the worry?

577
01:22:14,994 --> 01:22:18,760
Both of you will look
0after Sheetal and Guddi.

578
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:23,027
The man life has blessed
with two young brothers...

579
01:22:23,402 --> 01:22:24,801
He doesn't fear death!

580
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:34,577
I need your help!
I need your protection!

581
01:22:35,047 --> 01:22:36,036
But who is speaking?

582
01:22:36,616 --> 01:22:40,780
Ranjit, your informer is dead.
Shakal has found out all!

583
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,247
His men are after me now!

584
01:22:43,823 --> 01:22:46,553
I'm speaking from the bridge
near the Ahmedabad highway.

585
01:22:46,893 --> 01:22:48,121
Please come soon!

586
01:23:14,186 --> 01:23:16,051
Where has he gone?

587
01:23:16,722 --> 01:23:18,656
There was call and he left.

588
01:25:25,251 --> 01:25:31,190
Forgive me for making you wait.

589
01:25:31,857 --> 01:25:37,124
May I ask why I have been
brought here in this fashion?

590
01:25:39,732 --> 01:25:47,468
Maybe you are not aware
that you are not in Bombay.

591
01:25:48,174 --> 01:25:52,804
You are on an island
300 kms away from Bombay.

592
01:25:53,212 --> 01:25:57,808
And only I have the right
to ask questions here.

593
01:25:58,484 --> 01:26:02,750
The rest only
answer my questions.

594
01:26:05,257 --> 01:26:08,954
Anyway, you're new
to these parts.

595
01:26:09,662 --> 01:26:14,099
So I won't feel offended.

596
01:26:14,567 --> 01:26:17,730
What will you drink?
You don't drink wine.

597
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:24,266
You seem to know lot about me.

598
01:26:24,777 --> 01:26:28,838
Not a lot. Everything.

599
01:26:31,951 --> 01:26:34,784
But you haven't
introduced yourself.

600
01:26:36,889 --> 01:26:40,086
How can I praise myself?

601
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:45,754
Suffice it to say that the
murderous attempts on you...

602
01:26:46,499 --> 01:26:48,990
I instigated them.

603
01:26:50,269 --> 01:26:56,265
But whether it was your good
luck or the gunman's bad aim...

604
01:26:56,842 --> 01:26:58,275
You escaped.

605
01:26:59,678 --> 01:27:02,579
Have you brought me here
to congratulate me?

606
01:27:03,516 --> 01:27:07,919
No. I want to congratulate you...

607
01:27:08,254 --> 01:27:12,816
for your bravery and courage.

608
01:27:14,093 --> 01:27:17,392
- Thanks.
- Also one advice.

609
01:27:17,863 --> 01:27:21,697
This advice can be very
expensive if you like.

610
01:27:22,134 --> 01:27:23,897
Worth millions.

611
01:27:24,503 --> 01:27:26,027
I'm eager to hear it.

612
01:27:27,139 --> 01:27:35,945
Come. One thing intrigued me.

613
01:27:36,582 --> 01:27:39,983
You knew your life was in danger.

614
01:27:40,386 --> 01:27:42,752
Yet you were not afraid
at any step.

615
01:27:43,155 --> 01:27:44,645
Didn't ever move back.

616
01:27:58,637 --> 01:27:59,968
I was thinking...

617
01:28:00,673 --> 01:28:05,133
For the measly pay
of a policeman...

618
01:28:05,444 --> 01:28:08,311
a man who can stake his life...

619
01:28:08,747 --> 01:28:14,310
shat won't he do for millions?

620
01:28:17,656 --> 01:28:21,717
And what must I do
for those millions?

621
01:28:22,294 --> 01:28:23,556
One job.

622
01:28:25,331 --> 01:28:28,300
If you are fond of wealth...

623
01:28:29,034 --> 01:28:31,867
You can't refuse my offer.

624
01:28:32,638 --> 01:28:40,773
And if I say, I'm not interested
in wealth extracted from filth...

625
01:28:41,113 --> 01:28:45,482
If I say I don't accept
your offer...

626
01:28:45,885 --> 01:28:47,147
Then?

627
01:28:54,927 --> 01:28:56,656
Your wish.

628
01:28:58,664 --> 01:29:04,193
There's nobody in the world
who has ever refused me.

629
01:29:05,638 --> 01:29:10,541
Because those who ever
refuse me anything...

630
01:29:11,043 --> 01:29:16,811
none of them has remained
in this world.

631
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:27,518
You're standing at
the threshold of death.

632
01:29:28,494 --> 01:29:31,986
But you can stay alive
if you wish.

633
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:36,895
Not only alive, but
rich and successful.

634
01:29:37,937 --> 01:29:39,165
Think about it.

635
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:45,206
Sir, I do love my principles.

636
01:29:46,512 --> 01:29:49,538
But what's the point
in dying for it?

637
01:29:50,215 --> 01:29:57,519
Because if I'm no more,
of what use are my ideals?

638
01:29:59,391 --> 01:30:04,795
I think it makes more
sense to accept your offer.

639
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:07,896
Come in.

640
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:37,168
- Yes madam?
- Brought sir's clothes?

641
01:35:37,477 --> 01:35:39,911
- No madam.
- No madam!

642
01:35:40,313 --> 01:35:43,407
You can't remember anything
till it's told ten times!

643
01:35:44,651 --> 01:35:46,881
May I eat these sweets?

644
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,950
Yes, but not too many.

645
01:35:50,323 --> 01:35:52,883
- Why?
- Then you won't have dinner.

646
01:35:53,526 --> 01:35:55,289
Neither do you eat.

647
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:59,458
- I do eat.
- When did you eat today?

648
01:36:00,433 --> 01:36:04,836
Silly girl!
Today is Karva Chauth.

649
01:36:05,204 --> 01:36:09,004
Married women don't
eat food on this day.

650
01:36:09,575 --> 01:36:14,638
So that Daddy lives long.

651
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:17,379
Got it? Now go.

652
01:36:19,385 --> 01:36:23,344
- You're still here. Listen...
- Yes?

653
01:36:23,723 --> 01:36:28,683
Get a braid of flowers.

654
01:36:29,028 --> 01:36:30,791
I got it.

655
01:36:34,534 --> 01:36:38,527
She leaves the toys
wherever she plays.

656
01:36:39,038 --> 01:36:40,835
Where have you been?

657
01:36:41,307 --> 01:36:43,104
Vanished! No sign of you!

658
01:36:43,943 --> 01:36:50,940
You are 3 but all of you
have this habit of vanishing.

659
01:36:51,284 --> 01:36:54,014
Your brother hasn't
come since night.

660
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:59,221
If I crib, the same lecture;
you women don't understand.

661
01:36:59,692 --> 01:37:01,592
What is the responsibility
of a police officer.

662
01:37:02,028 --> 01:37:06,795
The sweater is lying since
yesterday for measurements.

663
01:37:16,542 --> 01:37:19,136
What's the matter?

664
01:37:23,549 --> 01:37:24,140
What's the matter?

665
01:37:34,093 --> 01:37:37,085
Sister-in-law...

666
01:37:38,297 --> 01:37:39,559
You tell her.

667
01:37:45,538 --> 01:37:52,603
What happened?

668
01:37:55,782 --> 01:38:00,446
Brother is no more!

669
01:38:08,461 --> 01:38:12,989
You are lying.

670
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:18,266
You are lying!

671
01:38:20,439 --> 01:38:24,500
Say that it is a lie.

672
01:38:25,511 --> 01:38:28,878
It's a lie!

673
01:39:42,922 --> 01:39:43,616
Excuse me.

674
01:39:45,691 --> 01:39:48,159
Are you Shiv Kumar's brothers?

675
01:39:49,996 --> 01:39:54,456
I can tell you something
about his murder.

676
01:39:57,003 --> 01:39:57,970
Yes?

677
01:39:59,438 --> 01:40:01,065
We can't talk here.

678
01:40:03,776 --> 01:40:07,007
All right. Come in.

679
01:40:33,072 --> 01:40:36,098
My name is Rakesh.

680
01:40:36,976 --> 01:40:42,209
I used to be a marksman
in a circus.

681
01:40:42,748 --> 01:40:44,739
What can you tell us
about our brother's murder?

682
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,519
What will he tell you?
He's the one who killed him!

683
01:40:50,489 --> 01:40:53,617
- What are you doing?
- Let go!

684
01:40:53,826 --> 01:40:55,157
I myself saw him shoot!

685
01:40:58,030 --> 01:41:01,898
Yes, it is true that
I tried to shoot your brother.

686
01:41:03,336 --> 01:41:09,036
But this is also true that
neither did I want to kill him...

687
01:41:09,709 --> 01:41:12,337
Nor have I murdered him.

688
01:41:12,912 --> 01:41:16,973
Just think. If I had killed him...

689
01:41:17,383 --> 01:41:20,511
why did I have to come here?

690
01:41:22,788 --> 01:41:25,814
But you just said
you shot at him.

691
01:41:26,959 --> 01:41:29,757
That's what I want to tell you.

692
01:41:30,162 --> 01:41:32,130
Why this happened.

693
01:41:32,832 --> 01:41:36,097
I worked in a circus.

694
01:41:37,803 --> 01:41:40,863
I exhibited my aim.

695
01:41:42,675 --> 01:41:50,241
You may not believe it, but I can
shoot blindfolded hearing voices.

696
01:41:51,684 --> 01:41:53,743
One day...

697
01:42:04,697 --> 01:42:08,133
You are?

698
01:42:08,567 --> 01:42:11,058
We've come to appreciate you.

699
01:42:11,537 --> 01:42:14,506
And to ask for your help.

700
01:42:14,907 --> 01:42:15,839
I don't understand.

701
01:42:16,208 --> 01:42:17,835
If you come with us...

702
01:42:18,677 --> 01:42:21,942
Shakal will explain to you.

703
01:42:24,817 --> 01:42:30,278
You may desire to know
why you've been brought here.

704
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:33,289
Yes.

705
01:42:33,993 --> 01:42:38,453
You have to do something for us.

706
01:42:40,099 --> 01:42:42,863
The job is very simple.

707
01:42:44,737 --> 01:42:48,798
You have to shoot a man.

708
01:42:51,744 --> 01:42:55,180
I'm giving you this job
because you're an artist.

709
01:42:56,315 --> 01:43:00,081
You can shoot down each
feather of a flying bird.

710
01:43:00,853 --> 01:43:04,789
And I respect your talent.

711
01:43:06,826 --> 01:43:09,522
The man you have to shoot...

712
01:43:09,995 --> 01:43:13,396
His name is Shiv Kumar.

713
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:17,901
You are under some misconception.

714
01:43:19,038 --> 01:43:21,529
I'm not a professional killer.

715
01:43:23,008 --> 01:43:27,001
Do you think I'll kill somebody
because you ask me to?

716
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:31,916
I don't think so.

717
01:43:33,319 --> 01:43:34,411
I know.

718
01:43:35,087 --> 01:43:41,754
- What do you know?
- That you love your wife a lot.

719
01:43:42,161 --> 01:43:43,628
What do you mean?

720
01:43:47,666 --> 01:43:52,933
What's happening?

721
01:43:55,674 --> 01:43:57,574
You'll know.

722
01:44:23,235 --> 01:44:29,538
Do I need to tell you
if you don't do my job...

723
01:44:29,942 --> 01:44:32,968
What will happen to your wife.

724
01:44:36,482 --> 01:44:40,213
You can't do this.

725
01:44:43,689 --> 01:44:45,623
You don't know me.

726
01:44:46,192 --> 01:44:48,023
I can do anything.

727
01:44:50,563 --> 01:44:55,159
The question is whether
you'll do this or not.

728
01:44:57,102 --> 01:44:59,536
I've never done this
kind of a thing.

729
01:44:59,905 --> 01:45:06,242
In this world, man has to do
everything once for the first time.

730
01:45:07,146 --> 01:45:09,979
She's your first wife.

731
01:45:10,616 --> 01:45:14,382
Won't you murder for the
first time for your first wife?

732
01:45:16,121 --> 01:45:17,088
I was helpless.

733
01:45:18,524 --> 01:45:20,287
I didn't want to
kill your brother.

734
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:26,330
But I needed time to
save my wife's life.

735
01:45:27,066 --> 01:45:33,232
That is why I shot at your
brother twice just to show.

736
01:45:33,639 --> 01:45:36,233
And missed my aim on purpose.

737
01:45:36,642 --> 01:45:38,303
One day...

738
01:45:38,677 --> 01:45:42,204
I was called to a palatial
house in the mountains.

739
01:46:09,708 --> 01:46:11,869
Welcome.

740
01:46:15,547 --> 01:46:21,349
Don't be scared. Just as
you can hear and see me...

741
01:46:21,754 --> 01:46:24,746
Similarly, I too can
see and hear you.

742
01:46:25,891 --> 01:46:29,827
I've called you here...

743
01:46:30,195 --> 01:46:33,460
Because today I'm
freeing your wife.

744
01:46:34,466 --> 01:46:38,698
Look there, outside the window.

745
01:46:43,609 --> 01:46:45,099
Saw that?

746
01:46:46,111 --> 01:46:54,712
You've been unsuccessful
twice in killing Shiv Kumar.

747
01:46:55,087 --> 01:46:56,816
Yet I trust...

748
01:46:57,656 --> 01:47:03,026
You won't be unsuccessful
in saving your wife.

749
01:47:03,529 --> 01:47:05,258
What?

750
01:47:06,565 --> 01:47:09,534
Yes, I forgot to tell you...

751
01:47:10,402 --> 01:47:17,137
The car in which your wife is
descending the crooked hilly roads...

752
01:47:17,810 --> 01:47:22,076
- That car has no brakes.
- What?

753
01:47:22,748 --> 01:47:27,082
Go quickly. Her life is in danger.

754
01:49:29,675 --> 01:49:32,542
I came here today...

755
01:49:33,045 --> 01:49:36,811
Because the ogre
who burnt your home...

756
01:49:37,182 --> 01:49:40,515
He has ruined my life too.

757
01:49:42,588 --> 01:49:45,955
The fire of sorrow and revenge
that burns in your hearts...

758
01:49:46,425 --> 01:49:48,450
burns in my heart too!

759
01:49:52,164 --> 01:49:53,324
Good you came here.

760
01:49:54,733 --> 01:49:57,497
You can help us in this
fight of good and evil.

761
01:49:57,903 --> 01:50:02,567
The three of us together can
burn this evil world to ashes!

762
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:07,342
From today, you are our
friend, partner and brother.

763
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:12,580
We have to fight
this war together.

764
01:50:19,925 --> 01:50:24,362
Listen to my story.

765
01:50:26,098 --> 01:50:29,465
The day your brother's
corpse was found...

766
01:50:30,102 --> 01:50:32,969
the papers carried the story.

767
01:50:33,238 --> 01:50:34,227
Police officer murdered.

768
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:41,507
- So?
- That very day...

769
01:50:42,114 --> 01:50:44,014
Raghunath was driving the car.

770
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:48,351
Kumar sir was sitting with
some Tiwari at the back.

771
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,381
They were both drunk.

772
01:50:51,323 --> 01:50:55,692
Both kept discussing
your brother's murder.

773
01:50:56,528 --> 01:51:00,020
And they kept taking
one man's name.

774
01:51:00,699 --> 01:51:03,361
Some Shakal...

775
01:51:03,869 --> 01:51:07,327
They said, what did
that policeman think...

776
01:51:07,739 --> 01:51:10,105
Shakal can finish anybody!

777
01:51:11,410 --> 01:51:12,707
- What do you figure?
- What else did they say?

778
01:51:13,111 --> 01:51:14,635
Raghunath couldn't understand.

779
01:51:16,548 --> 01:51:20,848
They spoke in a mixture
of English and Hindi.

780
01:51:21,219 --> 01:51:23,210
Raghunath doesn't know English.

781
01:51:23,622 --> 01:51:24,850
That's the problem.

782
01:51:32,764 --> 01:51:34,163
Here, take this.

783
01:51:34,499 --> 01:51:36,194
No, I won't take money for this.

784
01:51:36,602 --> 01:51:41,596
- Keep it.
- How vile do you think I am?

785
01:51:42,307 --> 01:51:44,707
Your brother died...

786
01:51:45,177 --> 01:51:49,671
And I felt I lost my brother.

787
01:51:50,549 --> 01:51:54,315
Keep it in your pocket.

788
01:51:54,886 --> 01:51:57,684
Allah looks after me.
Such money is sinful.

789
01:52:02,427 --> 01:52:09,162
That rascal Kumar goes to Venus
Hair Saloon for a shave every night.

790
01:52:16,675 --> 01:52:20,304
Just a minute sir.
I'll sharpen the blade.

791
01:52:27,052 --> 01:52:28,178
This seems to be the place.

792
01:52:29,187 --> 01:52:31,246
You go on in. I'll park the car.

793
01:52:46,405 --> 01:52:49,272
What is it? What are you doing?

794
01:52:49,975 --> 01:52:53,035
What do you know about the
murder of DCP Shiv Kumar?

795
01:52:53,812 --> 01:52:57,976
I don't know any such man.

796
01:52:58,350 --> 01:53:02,343
- But you know Shakal.
- Who is he?

797
01:53:02,821 --> 01:53:08,282
If you act smart, I'll chop off
your neck and keep it on the table.

798
01:53:09,094 --> 01:53:12,586
Remove this razor and listen to me.

799
01:53:13,465 --> 01:53:16,059
I think you are mistaken...

800
01:54:52,664 --> 01:54:54,962
Enough of these games!

801
01:54:55,667 --> 01:54:57,066
Now let's talk business.

802
01:54:57,969 --> 01:55:00,597
Who are you? What do
you know about Shakal?

803
01:55:01,139 --> 01:55:02,731
- I know nothing.
- Shut up!

804
01:55:03,375 --> 01:55:06,037
Tell me the truth.
What do you know about Shakal?

805
01:55:06,745 --> 01:55:11,546
I'm speaking the truth.
I have heard his name.

806
01:55:12,083 --> 01:55:13,573
But I've never seen him.

807
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:17,083
- Where have you heard his name?
- From Kumar.

808
01:55:17,489 --> 01:55:22,426
- I work for him.
- And he works for Shakal.

809
01:55:23,562 --> 01:55:26,656
- Yes.
- What does he do for Shakal?

810
01:55:29,835 --> 01:55:32,167
What does he do for Shakal?

811
01:55:35,841 --> 01:55:37,809
He has a godown.

812
01:55:38,343 --> 01:55:42,575
He stores goods
worth millions there.

813
01:55:43,682 --> 01:55:48,415
- I want the addresses.
- No! They will kill me!

814
01:55:48,887 --> 01:55:51,856
If you don't tell me,
I'll kill you!

815
01:55:54,359 --> 01:55:56,418
The address of the godowns!

816
01:56:00,465 --> 01:56:02,831
I'll tell you!

817
01:56:53,118 --> 01:56:57,521
You mean what happened
is that in broad daylight...

818
01:56:58,189 --> 01:57:02,455
right before your eyes,
the godowns were looted.

819
01:57:02,761 --> 01:57:03,750
They were burnt.

820
01:57:04,229 --> 01:57:08,632
You kept watching helplessly.

821
01:57:09,467 --> 01:57:14,268
Why? What do you want from me now?

822
01:57:14,706 --> 01:57:17,174
Should I laugh or cry?

823
01:57:19,277 --> 01:57:32,816
All of you are my special men.

824
01:57:33,425 --> 01:57:36,394
The three jewels of my court.

825
01:57:36,895 --> 01:57:46,770
Today these three jewels have come
to me with a complain like school kids

826
01:57:47,472 --> 01:57:49,531
That in front of their eyes...

827
01:57:49,975 --> 01:57:56,642
that ordinary mortals
ruined Shakal's image!

828
01:57:57,849 --> 01:58:01,250
Get out of my sight!

829
01:58:01,586 --> 01:58:06,455
Don't show me your face till
you've taken care of those men!

830
01:58:06,791 --> 01:58:09,487
Who dared to cross my path!

831
01:58:37,455 --> 01:58:38,854
Is this road all right?

832
01:58:39,324 --> 01:58:42,020
Yes, must be.

833
01:59:24,803 --> 01:59:27,328
- You were right.
- What do you mean?

834
01:59:27,839 --> 01:59:34,438
The road is not right.
We've left the road behind.

835
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:06,970
Now what will happen?

836
02:00:07,512 --> 02:00:09,776
Don't worry. All will be fine.

837
02:00:10,148 --> 02:00:11,638
Run out quickly!

838
02:00:31,936 --> 02:00:35,463
Remember if the job is done well...

839
02:00:36,241 --> 02:00:38,801
You'll all get 2000 bucks
as reward.

840
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:54,720
- What will we do?
- That's what I'm wondering.

841
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:58,428
There's only one way to get out.

842
02:01:01,432 --> 02:01:05,232
To reach the jeep...

843
02:01:10,375 --> 02:01:13,538
There is a gun and
bullets in the car boot.

844
02:01:13,878 --> 02:01:15,846
- But those people...
- Don't worry.

845
02:01:16,314 --> 02:01:19,215
I'll somehow get the
gun and the jeep here.

846
02:03:22,473 --> 02:03:24,464
What are you doing?
Do you want to die?

847
02:03:25,109 --> 02:03:28,670
- I got worried since you got hurt.
- Where's Guddi?

848
02:03:38,823 --> 02:03:40,381
What are you doing?

849
02:03:41,959 --> 02:03:46,419
If you want this girl to live,
raise both your hands and come out.

850
02:03:47,665 --> 02:03:50,691
- My baby!
- Control yourself.

851
02:03:51,402 --> 02:03:53,597
If you don't come out
at the count of 3...

852
02:03:57,942 --> 02:04:02,504
Don't worry. I'll bring her.

853
02:04:21,165 --> 02:04:22,996
Stop. Put down the gun.

854
02:04:31,109 --> 02:04:32,337
Good.

855
02:04:35,179 --> 02:04:37,147
Now come forward.

856
02:04:38,416 --> 02:04:41,214
This is you,
but where's the woman?

857
02:04:43,621 --> 02:04:46,590
You are my enemy.

858
02:04:48,326 --> 02:04:49,554
I am before you.

859
02:04:51,295 --> 02:04:53,263
- Let them both go.
- Whom do we let go...

860
02:04:53,631 --> 02:04:56,327
and whom we hold back,
we'll think about that later.

861
02:05:00,405 --> 02:05:01,770
Guddi, sit down!

862
02:05:41,813 --> 02:05:44,281
- Good day sir.
- How are you?

863
02:05:44,949 --> 02:05:46,644
Sunita didn't come today?

864
02:05:47,318 --> 02:05:49,912
- Shall I get you something?
- After a while.

865
02:06:06,471 --> 02:06:09,838
May I sit at your table
for a while?

866
02:06:10,208 --> 02:06:15,646
Sure. That would be nice.

867
02:06:16,614 --> 02:06:19,583
It's so crowded that
no table is vacant.

868
02:06:20,551 --> 02:06:23,782
That it is. The crowd is growing.

869
02:06:24,188 --> 02:06:28,454
Because the population
just keeps growing.

870
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:31,922
It's a very grave problem.

871
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:34,125
Do you follow what I'm saying?

872
02:06:34,465 --> 02:06:37,332
Yes, it's true. The problem...

873
02:06:37,702 --> 02:06:39,135
Exactly what I'm saying.

874
02:06:39,537 --> 02:06:46,670
You would understand. You look
like an intelligent, educated girl.

875
02:06:47,678 --> 02:06:50,511
Wish every person on earth
was as sensible as you are.

876
02:06:51,148 --> 02:06:53,742
- Are you married?
- Not yet.

877
02:06:54,485 --> 02:07:00,788
We're sailing in the same boat
because even I'm not married.

878
02:07:01,325 --> 02:07:05,694
Marriage is a strange thing.
Strangers till a few moments ago...

879
02:07:06,497 --> 02:07:08,988
become one for life in no time.

880
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:13,063
There are 2 schools of
thoughts regarding marriage.

881
02:07:15,706 --> 02:07:21,872
Some consider marriage necessary
others think it's foolishness.

882
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:23,947
What do you think?

883
02:07:24,749 --> 02:07:31,086
I think marriage is a stupid
mistake that one must commit.

884
02:07:31,455 --> 02:07:32,945
Very good!

885
02:07:33,624 --> 02:07:36,092
That was well said.

886
02:07:36,761 --> 02:07:38,626
But only two children.

887
02:07:39,196 --> 02:07:41,289
You mean we two and two of ours.

888
02:07:41,899 --> 02:07:44,163
- Shall I get something?
- Yes. What will you have?

889
02:07:45,503 --> 02:07:46,993
Get us two cups of coffee.

890
02:07:48,105 --> 02:07:52,098
What do you mean by 2 kids?
2 girls or 2 boys?

891
02:07:52,577 --> 02:07:53,942
One son and one daughter.

892
02:07:55,012 --> 02:08:00,177
- Clever girl! All planned.
- I know what I'll make them too!

893
02:08:00,718 --> 02:08:04,950
- The girl will be a doctor.
- Very nice.

894
02:08:05,456 --> 02:08:07,390
That's what I planned.
And the son?

895
02:08:08,159 --> 02:08:13,062
Like Sunil Gavaskar? Very good!
He'll earn us a good name!

896
02:08:13,497 --> 02:08:20,164
But tell me, I hope he won't
forget studies in cricket.

897
02:08:20,705 --> 02:08:26,405
Let me warn you, if he is careless
in studies, I'll thrash him!

898
02:08:26,777 --> 02:08:29,007
This is what's wrong with you.

899
02:08:29,513 --> 02:08:34,212
There are other ways of teaching
kids. You can't just beat them up.

900
02:08:35,086 --> 02:08:36,417
You handle your kids.

901
02:08:36,821 --> 02:08:43,954
The girl is fine but if the boy
does any mischief, I'll call him...

902
02:08:46,130 --> 02:08:49,930
Great! You're going great guns!

903
02:08:52,570 --> 02:08:56,233
Where were you?
I've been waiting for hours.

904
02:08:57,475 --> 02:09:03,004
- She's Sunita and this poor thing
- Doesn't matter.

905
02:09:03,814 --> 02:09:07,545
I don't want to disturb
your little family.

906
02:09:08,052 --> 02:09:10,748
You'll give your son out
when you do.

907
02:09:11,188 --> 02:09:12,917
I'm getting out now!

908
02:09:14,392 --> 02:09:17,828
Listen to me!
Where are you going?

909
02:09:19,463 --> 02:09:20,691
You take offense at jokes.

910
02:09:21,499 --> 02:09:22,659
It's a bad habit.

911
02:09:23,668 --> 02:09:28,128
I was joking. Tomfoolery.

912
02:09:32,443 --> 02:09:36,243
You are too much!
Taking a little thing seriously.

913
02:09:36,747 --> 02:09:41,013
Man goes to a restaurant and some
body sits before him, won't he talk?

914
02:09:41,519 --> 02:09:43,544
When you get angry, you're mad.

915
02:09:44,088 --> 02:09:46,989
I promise, I'll fix my
watch to All India Radio.

916
02:09:47,425 --> 02:09:49,359
I won't be a second late!

917
02:09:58,569 --> 02:10:01,094
- How are you?
- Yes, how are you?

918
02:10:01,839 --> 02:10:03,773
Even I'm fine.

919
02:10:07,344 --> 02:10:12,008
Aren't you feeling suffocated?

920
02:15:52,022 --> 02:15:55,321
- Are you all right?
- Yes, we're fine.

921
02:16:01,632 --> 02:16:02,929
Must be Shakal's men.

922
02:16:05,502 --> 02:16:08,027
Where is Rakesh?

923
02:16:13,043 --> 02:16:15,034
What's this?
This is what we feared.

924
02:16:15,446 --> 02:16:17,346
It's a little wound. It will heal.

925
02:16:17,681 --> 02:16:20,809
- Where's sister-in-law?
- Here and very well.

926
02:16:22,286 --> 02:16:24,220
This attempt of theirs
was unsuccessful.

927
02:16:25,089 --> 02:16:26,989
But we must be alert.

928
02:16:28,225 --> 02:16:30,352
We know what we will do.

929
02:16:30,861 --> 02:16:36,197
The question is what will
their next attack be?

930
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:42,930
The man who gives them all the
news walks on wheels not legs.

931
02:16:43,607 --> 02:16:46,041
And his name is Abdul.

932
02:16:46,577 --> 02:16:50,809
- He is handicapped.
- Handicapped?

933
02:16:56,453 --> 02:17:00,184
Then why is he still alive?

934
02:21:30,627 --> 02:21:35,963
Your brother died but I felt
as if I had lost my brother.

935
02:21:42,239 --> 02:21:45,800
Yesterday 4 men came to my shop.

936
02:21:46,343 --> 02:21:49,972
They asked me where Abdul was.

937
02:21:54,251 --> 02:21:55,218
Who were they?

938
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:06,596
- Take this.
- Softly, this glass...

939
02:22:07,030 --> 02:22:11,023
- What's this?
- A reward.

940
02:22:11,368 --> 02:22:12,460
- How much is it?
- 2000.

941
02:22:13,303 --> 02:22:16,136
- Where are the others?
- Upstairs.

942
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:19,202
Everybody's pockets are loaded;
so they are playing cards.

943
02:22:19,509 --> 02:22:23,036
Come along. Why are you here?
Today is a dry day, bar is closed.

944
02:22:23,480 --> 02:22:26,040
Yes, everything is closed but
I'll lock up everything and come.

945
02:22:26,450 --> 02:22:29,476
Maybe you're not aware
the bar is closed today.

946
02:22:53,810 --> 02:22:55,835
I know that the bar is closed.

947
02:22:57,414 --> 02:23:02,579
Maybe you don't know this bar
will remain closed tomorrow too.

948
02:23:04,421 --> 02:23:05,251
What are you doing?

949
02:23:05,555 --> 02:23:09,582
Who are these?

950
02:23:10,126 --> 02:23:13,289
I don't know anyone
by these names!

951
02:23:13,897 --> 02:23:19,392
Sir, they are very expensive.
Japanese glasses. Not available here!

952
02:23:21,404 --> 02:23:26,899
What is this? Hooliganism!

953
02:23:27,244 --> 02:23:28,711
I'll just call the police!

954
02:23:29,112 --> 02:23:31,239
- Come.
- Yes.

955
02:23:32,382 --> 02:23:36,318
You dial.

956
02:23:37,287 --> 02:23:41,951
- Now call them.
- This is a decent joint.

957
02:23:42,359 --> 02:23:48,025
I've come to meet decent people
who always sit in this bar.

958
02:23:50,500 --> 02:23:51,762
Will you break everything?

959
02:23:52,235 --> 02:24:04,272
Your bar and your life is not
worth more than Abdul's life!

960
02:24:05,649 --> 02:24:10,211
- Who is he?
- All this stuff...

961
02:24:10,954 --> 02:24:12,512
After breaking all this...

962
02:24:12,889 --> 02:24:19,294
When I start breaking your bones...

963
02:24:19,763 --> 02:24:26,498
Then all the answers...

964
02:24:26,803 --> 02:24:28,236
...will come to mind automatically.

965
02:24:28,505 --> 02:24:29,597
What do you want?

966
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:37,109
Those who sit in this bar...

967
02:24:37,614 --> 02:24:41,015
The decent people...

968
02:24:43,687 --> 02:24:45,678
- They are upstairs.
- Way?

969
02:24:47,824 --> 02:24:50,156
This way.

970
02:25:11,715 --> 02:25:12,477
What do you want?

971
02:25:14,584 --> 02:25:15,983
I don't want to see you alive.

972
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:19,117
How dare you come here!

973
02:25:20,190 --> 02:25:22,624
It's my principle...

974
02:25:23,126 --> 02:25:25,594
I always enter homes and beat.

975
02:26:54,651 --> 02:26:58,417
Believe us. We tried everything.

976
02:26:58,888 --> 02:27:02,016
- But they're so lucky...
- No, your eyes are bad!

977
02:27:02,659 --> 02:27:05,321
Would they oppose me
if they were lucky?

978
02:27:20,143 --> 02:27:21,132
Now watch...

979
02:27:22,645 --> 02:27:26,979
Watch what I do now.

980
02:27:31,454 --> 02:27:36,892
Assume that they are counting
the last breath of their lives.

981
02:27:38,528 --> 02:27:44,091
But I won't just kill them.

982
02:27:46,803 --> 02:27:51,866
I'll play with them and then kill.

983
02:27:52,475 --> 02:27:56,605
Like a cat kills mice.

984
02:27:59,349 --> 02:28:03,376
Sit quietly.

985
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:05,549
That would be best for you.

986
02:28:29,512 --> 02:28:31,207
You don't know me.

987
02:28:31,681 --> 02:28:34,582
But your late husband...

988
02:28:35,018 --> 02:28:38,454
...knew me very well.

989
02:28:40,423 --> 02:28:42,448
My name is Shakal.

990
02:28:43,459 --> 02:28:48,522
So you're Shakal?

991
02:28:48,798 --> 02:28:52,632
Yes, I am.

992
02:28:56,973 --> 02:28:59,840
Did you send for me?

993
02:29:00,610 --> 02:29:08,676
I'm fed up of your incompetence.

994
02:29:09,185 --> 02:29:13,451
- What is wrong, sir?
- You think I don't know.

995
02:29:14,991 --> 02:29:20,588
Devidayal ran away with my money'
millions of gambling money.

996
02:29:20,897 --> 02:29:23,661
But we'll find him.
Where can he go?

997
02:29:24,667 --> 02:29:30,628
Yes. Where can he go?

998
02:29:33,042 --> 02:29:36,478
Take Jagmohan away.

999
02:29:39,716 --> 02:29:42,480
And thrash him well.

1000
02:29:43,186 --> 02:29:45,586
- Sir, you...
- Take him away.

1001
02:29:45,855 --> 02:29:47,049
Listen to me...

1002
02:29:47,423 --> 02:29:54,329
Don't let him die.
He's my old man.

1003
02:29:55,531 --> 02:29:58,432
There's no doubt
it's Shakal's doing

1004
02:29:58,868 --> 02:30:02,304
It's easy for him to kidnap
people, make them disappear.

1005
02:30:03,139 --> 02:30:05,801
All right. But we can't sit tight.

1006
02:30:06,376 --> 02:30:08,867
The problem is how do
we reach his hideout?

1007
02:30:09,212 --> 02:30:10,577
I can take you there.

1008
02:30:13,583 --> 02:30:15,744
Who are you?

1009
02:30:17,654 --> 02:30:22,819
You don't know me but
Rakesh has seen me once.

1010
02:30:23,426 --> 02:30:25,621
I work for Shakal.

1011
02:30:27,096 --> 02:30:30,691
- Yes. Is Mrs. Shiv Kumar?
- Yes.

1012
02:30:31,167 --> 02:30:32,532
She is in his hands.

1013
02:30:33,236 --> 02:30:34,533
The reason for your coming here?

1014
02:30:34,904 --> 02:30:37,998
- I want to help you.
- Why?

1015
02:30:38,374 --> 02:30:43,937
Because the man for whom I
endangered my life many times...

1016
02:30:44,347 --> 02:30:48,613
That man, for an
ordinary mistake...

1017
02:30:49,419 --> 02:30:51,944
Nobody treats their dogs like this!

1018
02:30:54,257 --> 02:30:58,125
Anyway, you want to
reach the island?

1019
02:36:47,610 --> 02:36:52,513
I've heard a lot of
praise of your talent.

1020
02:36:53,015 --> 02:36:57,315
But it didn't do you justice.

1021
02:36:57,687 --> 02:37:00,884
You should get some reward from me.

1022
02:37:02,525 --> 02:37:05,926
Look there.

1023
02:37:10,533 --> 02:37:14,526
You've come here
looking for this reward.

1024
02:37:16,105 --> 02:37:22,704
Am I right, Mr. Vijay?

1025
02:37:23,112 --> 02:37:26,275
But this is not a reward.

1026
02:37:26,749 --> 02:37:29,513
This is a piece of cheese
that I kept in the mousetrap...

1027
02:37:29,819 --> 02:37:32,720
To trap the mice.

1028
02:37:35,257 --> 02:37:38,818
If I have made a reason
for you to come here...

1029
02:37:39,328 --> 02:37:43,890
...I have also thought of a way
that you could come here.

1030
02:37:50,539 --> 02:37:52,507
I sent him to you.

1031
02:37:54,110 --> 02:38:01,209
I knew seeing him injured,
you'd easily believe him.

1032
02:38:02,318 --> 02:38:07,119
You had to lose.

1033
02:38:07,590 --> 02:38:10,616
And I had to win.

1034
02:38:11,827 --> 02:38:15,786
Because I was playing
the game on both sides.

1035
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:20,064
And now the game is over.

1036
02:38:21,404 --> 02:38:22,962
Both of you stand before me.

1037
02:38:23,539 --> 02:38:26,906
And your third partner is
in the capture of my guards.

1038
02:38:27,476 --> 02:38:31,913
The third partner is here!

1039
02:38:37,219 --> 02:38:43,522
If you thought your ordinary
pawns could over power me...

1040
02:38:43,959 --> 02:38:46,291
Then you're quite a fool!

1041
02:38:49,698 --> 02:38:51,962
Nobody dare move!

1042
02:38:52,735 --> 02:38:58,139
You know I never miss my aim.

1043
02:38:59,575 --> 02:39:05,775
Ask your men to drop their guns.

1044
02:39:23,599 --> 02:39:29,401
So the game is not over.
You played your turn.

1045
02:39:29,839 --> 02:39:32,831
Now it's our turn.

1046
02:39:33,309 --> 02:39:38,941
The game of crime and sin always
ends with the death of the sinner.

1047
02:39:39,715 --> 02:39:41,876
Your end has come.

1048
02:39:46,755 --> 02:39:52,022
If you make one move, these girls
will be lying dead on the floor!

1049
02:39:56,932 --> 02:39:58,957
Throw away your guns!

1050
02:40:13,215 --> 02:40:14,375
You are kids.

1051
02:40:15,518 --> 02:40:18,715
The number of cards
Shakal has in his hands...

1052
02:40:19,154 --> 02:40:22,920
He has an equal number
up his sleeve too.

1053
02:40:23,993 --> 02:40:26,359
Whose end has come?

1054
02:40:26,996 --> 02:40:28,156
I'll tell you!

1055
02:42:09,898 --> 02:42:53,406
Your brave soldiers
are coming this way.

1056
02:42:55,310 --> 02:43:03,012
Now watch how I hunt these
birds while sitting here.

1057
02:43:19,835 --> 02:43:21,962
What's this?

1058
02:43:36,985 --> 02:43:39,681
So finally you came here.

1059
02:43:40,255 --> 02:43:44,555
But it's better if you
don't proceed further.

1060
02:43:49,832 --> 02:43:52,494
Now the button my finger is on...

1061
02:43:52,901 --> 02:43:55,392
On pressing it...

1062
02:43:56,004 --> 02:43:58,905
This chair, this woman...

1063
02:44:05,080 --> 02:44:07,571
Throw your arms.

1064
02:44:22,064 --> 02:44:26,763
Do what you please but
you can't escape alive!

1065
02:44:27,369 --> 02:44:29,428
To each his own thought.

1066
02:44:31,540 --> 02:44:34,168
Now you have to save yourself.

1067
02:44:34,610 --> 02:44:39,138
In your shoes, I would have
had no hopes.

1068
02:44:45,187 --> 02:44:45,744
Don't move!

1069
02:45:17,519 --> 02:45:21,319
How do I look after both of you?

1070
02:45:44,379 --> 02:45:52,218
This poisonous gas will gradually
make the party swing even more.

1071
02:50:11,179 --> 02:50:11,975
Don't move!

1072
02:50:21,523 --> 02:50:25,823
For the first time in life
I've come across brave men.

1073
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:35,897
You have put up
a brave fight.

1074
02:50:36,271 --> 02:50:40,264
Be prepared to die
with the same bravado.

1075
02:50:45,380 --> 02:50:46,745
Sister-in-law, help Rakesh!

1076
02:51:02,797 --> 02:51:06,164
Now what do you say?

1077
02:51:07,802 --> 02:51:09,429
Your game is up.

1078
02:51:10,739 --> 02:51:12,730
The game is in our hands.

1079
02:51:13,241 --> 02:51:18,702
Remember your crimes.

1080
02:51:19,381 --> 02:51:25,411
Think of all the innocents who
lost their lives at your hands!

1081
02:51:29,858 --> 02:51:32,452
Don't you like the game?

1082
02:51:33,528 --> 02:51:35,325
You've always played with lives.

1083
02:51:37,766 --> 02:51:40,132
Now be a toy yourself!

1084
02:51:46,575 --> 02:51:48,566
The button on which my finger is...

1085
02:51:49,077 --> 02:51:53,537
Pressing it,
your chair, your life...

1086
02:51:53,682 --> 02:51:56,549
Wait! You can't do this!

1087
02:51:56,685 --> 02:51:58,778
What? You want us to spare him?

1088
02:51:59,487 --> 02:52:03,924
He is Shakal! He's not a man.
He's a stigma on humankind!

1089
02:52:04,192 --> 02:52:04,988
He killed our brother!

1090
02:52:05,527 --> 02:52:10,226
He's the man who killed Rakesh'
wife and ruined his family!

1091
02:52:10,699 --> 02:52:15,295
He's the man who made
your child an orphan!

1092
02:52:15,870 --> 02:52:16,928
Who killed your husband!

1093
02:52:17,439 --> 02:52:20,738
I know he killed my husband!

1094
02:52:21,743 --> 02:52:25,304
But my husband taught me
to respect the law.

1095
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:29,079
And taking the law in your
own hands is not respecting it.

1096
02:52:29,751 --> 02:52:32,914
I know he's a murderer!

1097
02:52:34,022 --> 02:52:36,149
But we don't have the
right to punish him.

1098
02:52:36,424 --> 02:52:37,391
- But...
- No!

1099
02:53:24,606 --> 02:53:28,440
I know I am dying...

1100
02:53:28,877 --> 02:53:33,837
But you too won't be spared.

1101
02:53:35,650 --> 02:53:39,814
Because in 3 minutes,
this whole island...

1102
02:53:40,221 --> 02:53:43,088
...will blow up like a bomb!

1103
02:53:44,659 --> 02:53:46,854
If I couldn't win...

1104
02:53:47,195 --> 02:53:51,097
...I won't let anyone else
win either!

1105
02:53:53,134 --> 02:53:57,161
My name is Shakal!
