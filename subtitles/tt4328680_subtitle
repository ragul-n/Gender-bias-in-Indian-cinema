1
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,800
- Excuse me
- Hah! Doctor?

2
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,960
God is great

3
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,240
You can go home if you like

4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,760
- It's okay
- Are you sure?

5
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,400
Take a deep breath
and exhale

6
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,400
You don't have any problem

7
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,520
No problem?

8
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,720
No problem, sir

9
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,080
From yesterday you made me
lie down here and took so many tests

10
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,520
In the end you say
I have no problem

11
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,840
It's because we took those tests
we knew you have no problem, sir

12
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,240
Then I can go home?

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,800
You need 2 days
compulsory rest

14
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,320
Why...bill isn't hefty enough?

15
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,960
Due to excess mental tension
you suffered a panic attack

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,280
Blood pressure has shot up

17
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,440
2 days rest is compulsory

18
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,280
You are generally a jovial type
How did you get this panic attack?

19
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,760
Because I got worked up
over something unnecessary

20
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,080
Why are you adding salt
on to my wound now?

21
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,440
Don' get stressed out
Take adequate rest, okay?

22
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,120
Bhagyaraj sir?

23
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,280
How are you, sir?

24
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,200
A doctor saw me
and just left

25
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,880
Oh! I'm not a doctor, sir

26
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
Are you a compounder?
Have you got tablets for me?

27
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,280
I'm not a compounder either, sir

28
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,560
Then who are you?

29
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Your most ardent fan ever, sir

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,960
Fan?

31
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,640
I'm glad to hear that

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,440
We can talk leisurely
some other time

33
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
My situation isn't too good now

34
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,600
That's why I'm here, sir

35
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,440
You know my situation?

36
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,560
I believe someone stole your story

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,960
That's quite a common occurrence

38
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,440
Which incident was on your mind?

39
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,520
It's trending in Twitter now

40
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,360
- Twitter?
- Also in Facebook, sir

41
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,800
The present generation has
this knack of learning very fast

42
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,160
That's why I'm here to help you

43
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,040
What help?

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,440
I plan to tell you a story

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,000
Tell me a story...?

46
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,840
Didn't expect my situation
to get so bad in a single day!

47
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,120
Don't get me wrong

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,040
Don't think I'm being overconfident

49
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,600
But my story is original, sir
Not a copy of any Korean film

50
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,800
This story is based
on true events

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,000
You can add it in the titles too

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,600
I'm happy to see you speak
with so much self confidence

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,880
But if I don't like your story
half way through...

54
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
...you should leave
this room the next minute

55
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,480
The film opens with-

56
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,440
Wait, man

57
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,400
I told you if I don't like your story
you should leave the next minute

58
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,840
You never replied
and you're on 1st gear?

59
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,760
You agreed to listen
to at least half the story

60
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,120
Isn't that enough to
catch your attention?

61
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,120
Hero of my story is Arjun

62
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,680
Sounds good

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,040
Let's begin the story with what
his grandfather has to say about him

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,080
Arjun...half-baked is
a better name for him

65
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,240
Don't ask me about him

66
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,560
I'll get so mad
I'll beat him black and blue

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,800
He's totally irresponsible

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have no clue when
he gets home at night

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,720
He'll wake up at 12 noon

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,720
No idea if he brushes
his teeth or showers

71
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,280
He'll stuff some food and
roam around with his friends

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,480
He won't stick to a job
for more than 3 months

73
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,520
He'll keep jumping
from job to job

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,440
God knows what will happen to him
or what I can do about this

75
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,000
Arjun...don't ask
I don't know how I'll react

76
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Don't ask

77
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,480
My grandson Arjun
is a good-for-nothing lout

78
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,600
If you ask me anything
about him I'll get real mad

79
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,920
Sometimes I feel like
imprinting my 5 fingers on him

80
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,600
This is how his grandfather
will deride him from head to toe

81
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,400
You know what I'll say
as his grandma...?

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,880
My dear Arjun is so handsome

83
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,840
Good boy

84
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,240
He showers daily

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,120
No one can be
as smart as him

86
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,600
Always on his toes, very brisk

87
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,200
Wondering why I'm saying all this?

88
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,800
His genes are from my side
of the family tree

89
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,360
Not from that branch!
Hope he didn't hear me

90
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,800
Arjun isn't definitely a friend
who lends a helping hand

91
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
Do you know how many
people he owes money?

92
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,000
Even if he doesn't reach out
he won't let you down

93
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,400
That's his good quality

94
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,560
See you

95
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,280
When will this video
be uploaded?

96
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,760
Facebook or Youtube?

97
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,800
Tomorrow I'll be ready
with the presentation, sir

98
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,720
My name is Karna

99
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,920
What am I supposed
to talk about?

100
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,280
About Arjun

101
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,760
What should I talk?

102
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,240
I should say something
good about him?

103
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,200
He's a d-

104
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,080
'Dog, I swear'

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
Such a ho-

106
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
'Hooligan of the 1st order'

107
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,760
He's a sma-

108
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,640
'Smart chap doesn't fit the bill'

109
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,320
Name Arjun seems so familiar

110
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,040
I've seen it
in the register

111
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,080
Thinks he can pass off
as a sought after model

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,160
But he's just passable

113
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,240
We aren't connected
in any way at all

114
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,440
I'd love to compliment him like this

115
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,680
But for me to do so, he needs
to attend office regularly!

116
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,560
Anyway if you see him
ask him to meet me

117
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,760
Looks like he is the talk of the town
for being derided by every-

118
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,560
Yes, sir

119
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,240
It's understandable
if I sleep hearing your story

120
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,360
But if you narrate and
you nod off to sleep...?

121
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,480
I'm bored stiff being
the talk of the town, sir

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,440
My senses have gone numb

123
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,800
Everyone yells at you...?

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,960
That means-

125
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
Yes, sir

126
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,360
I'm that (in)famous Arjun!

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,280
What's your plan
for the evening?

128
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,120
No plans, office now
Then go back home

129
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,760
Why do you spoil your health
being a workaholic?

130
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,400
Evening party
My treat

131
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,560
- Booze, huh?
- Then what?

132
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,160
Do we roam around like
other Roadside Romeos?

133
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Come early this evening
Your comfort is my concern

134
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,840
You'll be drinking in my place
Why should you invite me?

135
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,240
Wrong, venue is my place

136
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,680
Krish-Mal are out of town

137
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,840
My grandparents!

138
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,720
I've texted all our friends

139
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,200
I can't drink with
the whole gang

140
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,440
I have a presentation tomorrow

141
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,240
I can't come

142
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,480
Just a presentation?!

143
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,080
Come home
I'll help you with it

144
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,880
Kid's stuff

145
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,600
Our friends after a few pegs
will come up with super inputs

146
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,280
You'll be the star perform-

147
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
I won't get convinced
whatever you say

148
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Karna, remember how I bowled slowly
for you to hit sixers when we were kids

149
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,800
How can I forget?
Bat was mine

150
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,000
Please...please come

151
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,840
Okay, fine

152
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,640
Hot or beer?

153
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,000
I know you'll want beer
let me go and buy it now

154
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,960
What?

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
What's the treat in aid of?

156
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
Come home
I'll tell you

157
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,760
How will I know
the reason for the treat?

158
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,440
Only then I can drink in peace

159
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,000
Why are you so late, Karna?

160
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,920
Why this chorus greeting?!

161
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,960
Hi senior

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,120
You can be late for anything
But to drink...unpardonable

163
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,920
Are you all jobless or what?

164
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,760
Arjun's party
That too plenty of beer

165
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,400
Work is secondary

166
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,520
Got a paper on you?

167
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,280
I do
Why?

168
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,360
Jot it down in a jiffy
'Definitely I won't get married'

169
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,840
This is for you

170
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,680
You're getting married?

171
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Then you won't enjoy
your wedding night

172
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,720
Here you go

173
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,920
New fad to invite
for your wedding night?

174
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,320
Give it to Arjun

175
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,720
Numbskull!

176
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,560
Where's Arjun?

177
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,400
He has gone to
buy booze for us

178
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,680
We'll get drunk as a skunk
all night through, okay?

179
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,960
I have to prepare
a presentation

180
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
Leave me out
I have a board meeting too

181
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,600
Mr Jinxed jerk! Why do you
keep staring at a stationary fan?

182
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,000
I am deep in thought

183
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,600
Why is Arjun treating us?

184
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,480
Why?

185
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,720
Has he been promoted at work?
Or is he going abroad, work related?

186
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,000
So many thoughts perched
inside this nest of yours!

187
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,600
Boys, you seem to have
landed on the dot!

188
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,200
What do you think
of my arrangements?

189
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,440
I think our problem will be
a shortage of booze

190
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,000
You drink a shot
and puke a lot

191
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,080
Zip your lips and sip!

192
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,320
Why are you treating us?

193
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,880
I won't tell you
Take a wild guess

194
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,840
Promotion?

195
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,360
Girl friend?

196
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,960
Shut up!
I'll tell you

197
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,120
This idiot would have
dumped his job

198
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,880
How did you find out?
You're my best friend

199
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
I asked permission to
attend the cricket match

200
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,720
Boss refused
I resigned

201
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,360
Let's watch the match

202
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,280
Looks like giving up my job
was a wasted effort!

203
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,440
We have plenty of booze
But no entertainment

204
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,680
Stupid of you!

205
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,120
Son of a tramp!

206
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,920
"If not 'it' then 'but' it is
Ask 'what' dear friends"

207
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,840
"To vodka's tune, sing
Indulge a jolly binge"

208
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,080
"If you get a chance to eat
Shakespeare's omelette"

209
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,040
"Dig into it without regret"

210
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,720
"Chennai Super Kings is
hand and glove with us"

211
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,920
"Drink up that quarter
to the last drop, partner"

212
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Why are you hesitating?
Go ahead, ring the bell

213
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,240
Uncle, I have a doubt

214
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,080
- Tell me
- Where's Janaki?

215
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,360
I'll slipper you!

216
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,200
"Watchman Manickam bro is asleep
We wake him up with PBS's voice deep"

217
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,440
"If you lift your head a little high
you can see stars twinkling in the sky"

218
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,760
"Glam doll babe's skirt micro mini
makes my head spin, dizzy-tizzy"

219
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,600
"Aunty who gossips but rarely greets
lets her hair down when no one sees"

220
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,880
"Chennai Super Kings is
hand in glove with us"

221
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,400
"Drink up that quarter
to the last drop, partner"

222
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,440
"Feeding the baby is this sweetie
who is staring daggers spicy"

223
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,920
Freebie uncle, dude
Pour some for him too

224
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,520
"Pain in the wrong place
signalling with his eyes"

225
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,760
"Don't obstruct my progress
I plan to fly, more or less"

226
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,680
"Add guts and grit to your body
And on a scale 8, shout a melody"

227
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,720
"If not 'it' then 'but' it is
Ask 'what' dear friends"

228
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,880
"To vodka's tune, sing
Indulge a jolly binge"

229
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,080
"If you get a chance to eat
Shakespeare's omelette"

230
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,760
"Dig into it without regret"

231
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,120
"Chennai Super Kings is
hand and glove with us"

232
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,080
"Drink up that quarter
to the last drop, partner"

233
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,080
What are you saying?

234
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,920
Why are all of you
making such a fuss?

235
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,760
How many times do we
excuse your boy's behavior?

236
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,600
He's just a youngster

237
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,880
One more time this happens-

238
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,640
What will you do?

239
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,520
I'll complain in
the association meeting-

240
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,400
Big deal

241
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm sparing him for your sake

242
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,680
- You get inside
- We aren't jobless like your grandson

243
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
He's treating them it seems
for resigning his job

244
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,520
(babble of voices)

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,440
One at a time please
How can I hear anything?

246
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
You ensure your grandson
behaves properly

247
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,040
Listen to me
We'll do that-

248
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,920
Hey buffalo!
Get up

249
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
What, gramps?

250
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,440
I'll break your teeth

251
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,240
Get up

252
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,160
Wait, gramps

253
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,800
Why do you keep
yelling at me, gramps?

254
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,200
What else do you want me to do?
You dumped your job it seems

255
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,640
What's the count?
17th or 18th company?

256
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
Go ahead...yell

257
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,400
If my parents had been alive
they'd have yelled at me too

258
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,360
Scold me

259
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,280
But would I have been this way
if they were alive, I don't know

260
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,760
How long will you wallow in
self pity with this same drama?

261
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,360
This is a drama to you?

262
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,560
Me being an orphan
is entertainment for you?

263
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,280
Go-

264
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,520
Why were you so harsh, dear?

265
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,960
Instead of scolding him you want me
to roll out sweet balls in a temple?

266
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,440
You are to blame

267
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,200
You know what?
He's a youngster

268
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,080
If you explain patiently
he'll understand

269
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,760
But you yelled at him
to your throat's content!

270
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
Oh! Only he has a heart
and I won't be hurt, huh?

271
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,880
Hearing our neighbours deride him
I feel like hanging myself

272
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,120
My darling!
Why are you leaving?

273
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,320
Your grandpa was harsh
You aren't at fault, dear

274
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,760
Look at the imbeciles
Bachelors in A341

275
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,640
They drown in alcohol daily,
sprawl and puke all over

276
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,640
You don't make a mess
like them, do you?

277
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,440
Tell him the flat number also
So he can party and raise hell

278
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,360
You'll put ideas into his head
and spoil him, huh?

279
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,720
I gave him this idea?

280
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,840
If you tell him to
get out of the house...

281
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,840
...where will he go?

282
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,640
Let him live on his own
Earn money, rough it up

283
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,760
Only then he'll know
the value of money

284
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,920
He can't rough it up

285
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,680
He's as innocent
as a new born baby

286
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,520
What will he do?

287
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,200
He's such a baby, if you take
a beer bottle to his mouth...

288
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,200
...he'll drink it to the last drop!

289
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,880
Forever deriding him
You have no other work

290
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,720
Do you want me to cuddle him?

291
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,800
- What's wrong with a hug?
- Are you mad?

292
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,240
What did he do
that was so wrong-

293
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,040
Don't talk
I'll break all your teeth

294
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,680
Do you know how much
a beer bottle costs?

295
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,120
- I have no idea
- He's drinking with my money

296
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,880
Beer bottles are strewn
all over this place

297
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,600
Is that a crime?

298
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,320
Gramps!

299
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,680
You're simply sitting at home
taking voluntary retirement

300
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,560
You can clear it up

301
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,320
You're crossing your limit

302
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Try doing-

303
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
STOP...!

304
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,160
What, sweetheart?

305
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,920
Why should you both fight
because of me?

306
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,920
When I have all the comforts
and gramp's money...

307
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,680
...am I an idiot to
walk out on all this?

308
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,680
That's right

309
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,320
If I should feel bad
for all that gramps feels...

310
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,320
I should have walked out
when I was in kindergarten

311
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,200
Well said!

312
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Don't fight because of me

313
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,440
I'll see Karna and be back

314
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,440
Dearest, you seem to be very tired

315
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,200
'Laddu' to sweeten you!

316
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,160
Dear Lord of the 7 hills!
Please save my grandson

317
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,840
What are you doing here?

318
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,920
Mad at me?

319
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,000
No...don't pull words
out of my mouth

320
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,440
You drink it all up

321
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,840
I got it for you
How can you refuse?

322
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,880
No means NO

323
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,480
I have 4 bottles
of beer here

324
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,680
Tell me in just 3 words
Why don't you want a beer?

325
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,520
I have to do justice to
my presentation tomorrow

326
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,720
Thanks to your drinking spree
last night, I couldn't do it today

327
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,920
At least let me finish it now

328
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,600
Yesterday the boys were
a source of distraction

329
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,760
Today it's just you and me

330
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,280
Just a little bit and
go ahead with your work

331
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,000
Fine, I'll drink
You scoot from here

332
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,680
No, don't

333
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,920
Go and sit in a corner

334
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,200
Come near me,
I'll trample you flat!

335
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,920
'However much I yell at him
he isn't budging from here'

336
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,320
Shall I watch TV?

337
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,280
Why?

338
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,920
I watch 'Luck or kick' daily

339
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,440
I want to watch it today too

340
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,520
Okay, fine, watch

341
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,000
At this rate how will I ever
finish my presentation?

342
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,200
Look at that

343
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,040
Roja's costume is sooooper

344
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,840
She's hot

345
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,880
Switch that off
I'll drink with you

346
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,960
TV is just for company

347
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,840
Can I switch on the TV now?

348
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,400
HBO is telecasting 'Avengers'

349
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,480
It's worth watching

350
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Avengers...fine!

351
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,280
Okay...watch

352
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,400
Basically my family gives
importance to bravery

353
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,280
Look at that...wow!

354
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,120
Where did you get this speaker?

355
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,880
Why?

356
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,600
Sound seems to travel
all the way here, dude

357
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,520
I can hear the sound
right next to me

358
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,480
Basically my family gives importance
to sound when it comes to movies

359
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,400
Hearing your words
my head seems to spin

360
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,520
You heard my words
and your head spins, okay

361
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,080
Why is my head spinning too?

362
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
Proves this is original booze!

363
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,760
Why...why...why did you?

364
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,880
I didn't

365
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,240
Why did it switch off then?

366
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,320
Hey Karna, can you feel it?

367
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,080
Floor is shaking
Books are falling down

368
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,720
Earthquake

369
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,480
Hold the bottle

370
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,280
Let's go down

371
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,600
I'm coming...wait

372
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,160
Hold the baby

373
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,840
5 more floors to go?

374
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,920
(babble of voices)

375
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,560
- Take me also to safety, sis
- How dare you call me 'sis'

376
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,840
This is why I told you not to
buy a flat in the 7th floor!

377
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,000
Look how they are running
holding on to their dear lives

378
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,800
Like a lodge
raided by the police

379
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,200
That's why elders say...

380
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,640
...'what will you take
with you when you die!'

381
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,800
Take this

382
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,720
Why are you drinking
without me?

383
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,720
(overlap of voices)

384
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,880
It is shaking
So we started to come down

385
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,280
'He isn't going back
even after an earthquake!'

386
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,000
Pah!

387
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,400
She and I have
some connection

388
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,120
When there's so much
space all around...

389
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,880
...why should she stand
right next to me?

390
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,600
For no rhyme or reason, only we are
standing 200 meters close to her

391
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,960
Shall I talk to her?

392
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,760
Hi! I'm Karna
I stay in this complex

393
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,360
Hi! I am-

394
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,960
But he doesn't stay here

395
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,520
What-

396
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,000
We didn't ask you
for these details

397
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,120
Because of this tremor...

398
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,440
...by now in South Korea
a volcano must have erupted

399
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,600
How are the 2 connected?

400
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,080
Say something to cover up

401
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,920
So if we are connected
then will you talk to us?

402
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,080
Which flat are you in?

403
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,920
Are you taking a dig at us?

404
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,200
I'll complain
in our association

405
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,520
Keep quiet, please

406
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,480
I just called EB
No problem it seems

407
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,320
I thought DD only anchors
'Koffee with DD'

408
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,680
She even reports
on the weathe-

409
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,000
I just tried my hand at comedy!

410
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,240
Forget it if I didn't
make you laugh

411
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
Hi, I'm Arjun

412
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,120
Anjali

413
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,720
I'm Keerthi

414
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,520
I can be whoever
He'll go home tomorrow

415
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,400
They are really loony

416
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,280
Did you call me?

417
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,160
Get lost!

418
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,720
Love at first sight

419
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,440
I saw first

420
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,280
- Anjali
- Keerthi

421
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,680
Good night

422
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,400
How can I sleep now?

423
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,320
Ouch! My hands and
legs are creaking!

424
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,040
Whatever!

425
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,320
Did he call?

426
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,240
Huh...?

427
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,760
- Did he call?
- He called

428
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,280
He has gone with
his friends to the theater

429
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,000
He asked me to tell you
he'd be back in the morning

430
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,520
What are you looking at me for?

431
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,120
Malini...look at me

432
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,000
He will be fine
He'll come home in one piece

433
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,640
Why is he so irresponsible?

434
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,160
I'm trying my best to
adjust to his demands

435
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,480
He's young

436
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,800
You give in and
I'm a little strict

437
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,680
This way we will
maintain a balance

438
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,720
It will all be fine

439
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,320
I'm sure he'll be back

440
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Just my silly heart getting
perturbed unnecessarily

441
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,520
In that sentimental scene
instead of a guitar or violin...

442
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,040
...it will be truly colorful if a raga
is used as background score, sir

443
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,960
You just stop with
telling me the story

444
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,120
Don't go to maestro Ilaiyaraaja or
Oscar award winner A.R.Rahman...

445
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,040
...and give them notes on music

446
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,400
Story, screenplay, direction, dialogs
and music are like hand and glove

447
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,720
Don't you compose music
with no knowledge of it?

448
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,560
It's all a question
of involvement, sir

449
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,360
There's a thin line between
involvement and being over smart

450
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,320
You tried to nail me!
But that's alright

451
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Wonder if it will be
excess baggage?

452
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,520
Come here

453
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,720
I am coming

454
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,240
What?

455
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,720
Check if you have
all that you want in here

456
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,160
This bag has
all that you need!

457
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,680
For me?

458
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,720
Smart Alec!

459
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,400
Hide this right at the bottom

460
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,760
Stuff it in properly

461
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,400
Shut it
He'll be back now

462
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,200
Okay, madam

463
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,320
He'll co-
He has come

464
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,520
Err...uh...what?

465
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,760
He knows we are
leaving in the morning

466
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,480
How can he sleep
without any sense?

467
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,640
Buffalo!

468
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,520
Wake him up

469
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,960
Poor thing
So what if he sleeps?

470
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,240
If he wakes up, your blood pressure
will shoot up because you'll yell at him

471
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,520
That's why, I just let him sleep

472
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,240
Thanks to your pampering
he is as lazy as a buffalo!

473
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,040
Wake him up

474
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,840
Why don't you
wake him up?

475
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,360
I didn't say anything

476
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,960
Is she planning to sell
vegetables in USA?

477
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,920
Arjun bro

478
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Your grandfather is calling you

479
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,880
He's snoring away to glory
Wake him up somehow

480
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,240
What are you doing?

481
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,560
Sir asked me to
somehow wake him up!

482
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,440
Does that mean you should use
your hair pin to open the lock?

483
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,080
Look what she's doing

484
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,480
In E58 a thief broke in this way
That's what I had told her-

485
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,480
Will you stop being Hercule Poirot
and wake him up, my dear?

486
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,280
It's getting late

487
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,040
GO now

488
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,360
Pah! Fine, I'll go

489
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,000
I'll wake him up

490
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,680
Arjun sweetie, my little prince!

491
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,560
Get up, we are
leaving today, right?

492
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,760
He's yelling non stop

493
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,080
- He has no other job
- Don't blame him now

494
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,880
Get up, darling

495
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,640
"Don't sleep, sonny, don't sleep
Don't be branded as a lazy creep"

496
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,560
Glam-ma, how many times
I've warned you not to sing?

497
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,400
From when I was a kid,
I'm swimming in doubt...

498
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,880
...whether you wake me up with
your song or put me to sleep!

499
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,720
Is that so?

500
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,920
Give me 20 minutes

501
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,280
Just 40 winks and
I'll be super fresh!

502
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,280
This is a perennial
problem with you

503
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Wake up, please

504
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,720
We have to leave

505
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,240
Wait...he's coming
He's brushing his teeth

506
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,720
It's 10'o clock
Wake up that damn donkey

507
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,040
Don't be mean
calling him a donkey

508
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,480
Our neighbor's son will get up at
4:00 p.m and wish me good morning

509
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
It's only 10:00 a.m

510
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,320
He's tired
Poor thing

511
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,240
Our neighbor's son
works hard for a living!

512
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,560
Do you know he works night shifts
and earns Rs 25000 a month?

513
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,120
Our grandson roams
all the roads like a donkey!

514
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,280
When prayer starts at
6:00 p.m in Sai Baba temple...

515
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,040
...he'll gallivant and come back when
we listen to 'Suprabhatam' at 6:00 a.m!

516
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,400
Good morning, sir

517
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,720
You're wishing me
'good morning' at noon!

518
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,280
Okay, come to the point
Why did you wake me up?

519
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,680
Instead you are talking
of everything else on earth?

520
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,280
You're becoming
too big for your boots

521
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,960
Your grandma and I were so tensed
when we heard about the earthquake

522
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,120
How many times we called you?

523
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,640
Shouldn't you have the sense to look
at the 'missed' calls and call us back?

524
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,400
I didn't get any call

525
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,160
Check properly

526
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,680
I swear, gramps

527
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,720
No proper education

528
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,560
Not smart enough
to stick to any job

529
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,360
At least learn the art of lying!

530
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,960
You brought me up
What do you expect?

531
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,960
You are good at retort-

532
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,400
You hold a PhD
in this alone, rascal!

533
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,920
Glam-ma, have a safe flight

534
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,560
Take care of gramps, his BP
keeps shooting more than 140

535
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,880
Careful

536
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,880
Give it to me

537
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,080
I'll do it

538
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,320
Keep that there

539
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,920
Why?

540
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,760
Keep it there

541
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,640
What happened?

542
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,920
Arjun, just because we aren't here
don't keep roaming all over

543
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,320
Eat regularly

544
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,560
Please answer when we call

545
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,120
Okay-

546
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,800
Just keep quiet
As if he'll listen to you

547
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,200
My friend Ramakrishnan
who works in Delhi

548
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,080
He has some work here
for 3 months

549
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,280
I've given our flat to him

550
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,360
Okay, I'll take care

551
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,840
You don't have to take care

552
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,960
Don't disturb him
I've rented our flat to him

553
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,880
Don't play the fool, gramps

554
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,760
Why should I play games
with you at this age?

555
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,320
That box has all your clothes
Go and stay somewhere

556
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,040
Whaaat?

557
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,200
Stay outside?

558
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,960
Here's Rs 5000
for your expenses

559
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,880
Get yourself Adidas shoes
if you save any money

560
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,400
What will I do with
this miserable 5000 bucks?

561
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,240
You'll know the value of money
if you put in a hard day's work

562
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,360
I've also had a job

563
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,800
You mean jobS!

564
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,160
Glam-ma, you tell me
How will 5000 be enough?

565
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,480
It won't be

566
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,960
"You can live if you want to
Isn't there a way on earth, dude?"

567
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,200
Composer Viswanathan, help me!

568
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,560
Rs 720 for you
Spend prudently

569
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,240
Yes

570
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,360
Stop singing
and answer me

571
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,080
Will my parents
abandon me like this?

572
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,680
How long will you be stuck on
this dialog...try something new

573
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,800
Glam-ma...Glams...please

574
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,080
Don't slide my ring and
bangles off my hand

575
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,520
We are not taking a bus
to some remote village

576
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,080
The flight won't wait for us
We are late as it is

577
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,960
Bye bye, take care, dear

578
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,760
Go man

579
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,000
Start the car, man

580
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,600
I didn't like the way
we left him, feel terrible

581
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,080
You think I love him any less?

582
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,520
I didn't mean that

583
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,120
Whatever!

584
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,360
I was strong when we lost
our son and daughter-in-law

585
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,680
I've even survived
2-3 days without you

586
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,080
I've never been
a single day without him

587
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,920
Is it right what you did?

588
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,000
May not be right
But I won't say it's wrong

589
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,760
He's such a kid
Poor thing

590
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,600
Don't obsess

591
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,840
He needs to learn it the hard way

592
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,720
He'll stick to one job
to make ends meet

593
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,560
He'll become responsible

594
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,280
It's all for his own good, right?

595
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,560
How long can we pamper him?

596
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,360
How much longer
will we be around?

597
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,840
That's true

598
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,520
He'll reform

599
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,440
It's after all
for his own good

600
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,960
Let him know
what it is to struggle

601
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,320
He's so young

602
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,560
Wonder where he'll go
and how he'll manage!

603
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:32,840
"I'm distancing myself from you
For you to realize a few home-truths"

604
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,320
The upper-class is
always aristocratic!

605
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,520
When your grandparents
were immersed in sentiments...

606
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
...what were you doing?

607
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,560
I was-

608
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,920
Spill it

609
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,200
2 beer
Wait, man

610
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,160
1 minute
I'll be with you

611
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,800
The guy we met last night
and you share the same flat?

612
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,960
That country bumpkin?

613
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,880
Not yesterday
From today, yes

614
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,960
So you're living
in this place now?

615
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,280
Living...yes, I intend
'living it up' from today

616
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,440
Arjun, I want to
tell you something

617
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,560
We haven't pressed the lift button

618
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,800
Why don't you discard
the 7 of hearts please?

619
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,560
If you discard the card
next to it, you'll be doomed!

620
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,760
Is that fellow 6
silently sitting there?

621
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,080
Wait, please wait

622
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,840
Imagine my plight,
teaching rummy to this nitwit!

623
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,520
Yes, sir?

624
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,680
I'll come immediately

625
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,920
Who was that?

626
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,760
Boss!

627
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,920
Why did he call you?

628
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,440
I think he wants to praise me and
give me the appraisal in person

629
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,440
Everything is ready
All you have to do is sign

630
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,840
I didn't resign

631
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,240
We are making you resign

632
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,400
But I didn't do anything

633
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,000
That is exactly
the complaint against you!

634
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,640
It seems, past 1 week, you haven't
submitted your presentation

635
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,280
Finished now, sir

636
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,520
You haven't written
the source codes I heard

637
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,320
Done, sir

638
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,440
You have no clue
about anything

639
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,680
I'm at the office daily
at 9:00 a.m sharp, sir

640
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,320
You come and go punctually
But what do you do in between?

641
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,160
Just excuse me once, sir

642
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,560
Karna, we've removed
your name from the system

643
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,880
Search for my name, sir

644
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,400
Whichever paper you sign, I'll file it

645
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,800
Why, sir?

646
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,600
Final settlement check is ready

647
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,320
We haven't done this
to anyone in our company

648
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,320
Go ahead and sign

649
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,160
No one else has got
this privilege, sir?

650
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,800
I'm glad

651
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,400
Now it looks like you resigned

652
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,200
You can go and
seek a job elsewhere

653
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,240
Your reputation is in fact
essential for our company

654
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,000
Other than you, me
and the team leader...

655
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,720
...no one else knows
about this episode

656
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,600
You keep it to yourself

657
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,840
'Get lost!
God favors me'

658
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:55,840
"If a jobless graduate shows his might
you'll get electrocuted out of sight"

659
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:05,320
"If a jobless graduate shows his might
you'll get electrocuted out of sight"

660
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,480
Sir, don't get dejected

661
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,320
I have work to attend to
for 6 months in my home town

662
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
That's why I resigned

663
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,440
Whole office is talking of
how you got chucked out

664
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,880
Entire office?

665
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,520
No love lost
on fancy names!

666
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,520
1 cup tea and 1 cigarette

667
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,440
18 bucks

668
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,680
Keep an account, bro

669
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
You think it is some kind of
celebrity account to write off?

670
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,480
'If hand full of money
eat pancake and honey'

671
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,280
Don't touch that

672
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,560
Heard you lost your job?

673
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,920
Even you know it, huh?

674
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,160
Your office grapevine
is strong here

675
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,560
It's even on twitter

676
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,640
Doesn't matter

677
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,880
Told you not to touch, right?

678
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,240
Off you go
Don't block the breeze

679
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,560
Not every tea stall owner
can end up as Prime minister!

680
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,320
What are you doing here?

681
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,760
Pissed off that you lost your job?

682
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,520
Yes, dude

683
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,160
That boss of mine had a field day
giving me a piece of his mind

684
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,280
How do you know?

685
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,880
Your phone was switched off

686
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,560
You called my office
and they told you, right?

687
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,880
After promising me
it will be confidential...

688
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,040
...he has told the whole world
What wrong did-

689
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,720
- What now?
- Why did you lose your job?

690
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,240
Why won't you ask?

691
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,320
After being the cause of my misery

692
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,080
How am I the reason?

693
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,840
Who asked you to send
a message to my boss saying...

694
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,520
...I couldn't finish the presentation
because of the earthquake?

695
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,240
Do you know
how he derided me?

696
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,840
Tell me without being amused

697
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,480
Not laughing
I am crying!

698
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,560
You know what he said?

699
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,240
What?

700
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,000
Karna, I stay in the same area

701
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,840
Earthquake lasted for 2 minutes
You were given a week to do this

702
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,000
What hit you then?

703
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,280
Hurricane, cyclone, Lisa,
Nisha, Gowri, Janaki

704
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,920
Go home

705
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,000
I'll be staying here
for the next 3 months

706
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,000
Whaaat?

707
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,480
My grandparents
have gone to USA

708
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,880
Mad at me, they rented
the flat to some mental case

709
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
So...?

710
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,360
Who else do I have
other than you?

711
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,640
Do you remember?

712
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,360
When we were kids-

713
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,040
Why should you walk out
because of me?

714
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,960
I'm just helping myself to a beer

715
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,360
Last beer, dude

716
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,400
He asked me to do his job

717
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,640
Because I didn't do it,
he chucked me out

718
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,200
Is this fair, my lord?

719
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,960
Not at all, my lord

720
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,680
- My lord?
- Not fair

721
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,120
My boss refused to let me go
for a simple cricket match

722
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,320
Imagine denying
such a fair request?

723
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,040
It happens in every road
and house, my lord

724
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,520
If I wag my tail to
everything that dog says-

725
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,840
If you wag?

726
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,680
Should you keep wagging?

727
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,400
Bite him good and hard, boss

728
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,800
I'm lying it seems

729
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,400
As if he is honest
from head to toe!

730
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,080
Thinks he's Anna Hazare or what?

731
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,960
You are by yourself
Don't disturb us

732
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,000
We'll move to another table

733
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,760
We don't even know you

734
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,840
Let's shift

735
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,720
Simple

736
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,040
So what?

737
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,880
How much I empathised with
your story, every word and syllable

738
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,000
Who asked you to empathise
every word and syllable, sir?

739
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,640
Only a worker will know
how another worker suffers

740
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,240
Sir, just tell whatever
you have in your mind and go

741
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,880
What about the beer I ordered?

742
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,200
It hasn't been served as yet

743
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,080
Not yet...?

744
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,400
Sir, eat this omelette
Tell what's on your mind

745
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Actually the point-

746
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,960
All about my boss

747
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,640
He'll be fine in the morning

748
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:16,760
After lunch he'll call me to his cabin
and scold me nonstop for 45 minutes

749
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,000
I have no idea why

750
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,600
There isn't any other
worker in your office?

751
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,480
He can call anyone and yell

752
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,920
Are you so dumb?

753
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,320
Don't be mean

754
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,920
Actually, it was in September

755
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,400
Raining cats and dogs

756
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Thunder

757
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Lightning

758
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,080
Steady downpour

759
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Couldn't work at all

760
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,240
But video game...!

761
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,320
Thanks for the beer

762
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,400
We are leaving

763
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,360
Who will keep me
company, if you don't?

764
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,280
What a pain!

765
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,800
I don't care
how much I spend

766
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,720
But I must scream
all the swear words at him

767
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,720
Don't you like your job?

768
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,880
I like my job, God
But that boss...yuck!

769
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,200
What can you do?

770
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,440
If you yell at him
won't you lose your job?

771
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,480
Even if someone else
yells at him, I'm fine with it

772
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,440
But understanding
my feelings inside out...

773
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:30,160
...he should use all the words possible
in the Tamil dictionary and yell at him

774
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,280
How can this be done?

775
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,880
There must be someone

776
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,000
Get lost, my lord!

777
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,240
Oh my God!!

778
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,600
Yes, whom do you want?

779
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,240
Boochi?

780
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,080
Wrong name
Faaaaachi!

781
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,800
Sochi?

782
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,080
Can we see Mr Nachiappan?

783
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
I am Nachiappan

784
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,120
He's our man, dude

785
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,040
Yes, what do you want?

786
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
Courier for you, sir

787
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,800
Oh! Give it to me

788
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,880
1 minute, sir

789
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,920
We'll read it out to you
That's our specialty

790
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,840
Good idea
Go ahead

791
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,720
What's this?

792
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,680
Courier witness
protection program, sir

793
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,240
Is that so?

794
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,760
Focusing your mouth, sir

795
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,840
In short, we'll tell you
in just 3 words, sir

796
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,720
Go ahead

797
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,560
Most respected and
admired Mr Nachiappan

798
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,040
Do you add salt to your food...

799
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,040
...or are you immune to
sense and sensibility?

800
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,160
This is an age-old proverb

801
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,360
Assuming you think differently
you make an ASS of U and ME!

802
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,040
What was so wrong
with what we did?

803
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,960
Then what?

804
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,200
You took money from
a random stranger

805
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,440
And you spat all the swear words
you know at some random fellow

806
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,560
You call this a business?

807
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,760
Even if I used this as comedy in
my film, audience will laugh at me!

808
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,800
Roll

809
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,120
He tortures me
even in my dreams!

810
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,120
This isn't a dream, wake up

811
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,360
He's really torturing me

812
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,160
Get up

813
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,880
He forces me to booze at night

814
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,640
During the day, he doesn't
let me sleep in peace

815
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,600
I've suddenly become responsible
and I don't know how to handle it

816
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,680
Karna, wake up

817
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,440
Why do you pester me
even on a Sunday?

818
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,960
How can busy business magnates
like us take Sunday off?

819
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,640
Even if it's the job of
a Collector, I need Sunday off

820
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,840
Do you want the same courier
we delivered to Nachiappan?

821
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,240
Same dictionary for all
Listen to my business idea

822
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,640
I don't want any begging idea

823
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,760
We shall announce the news

824
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,320
You're the only one left
who hasn't done this

825
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,760
Are you starting
a News channel?

826
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,120
Congratulations!

827
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:35,800
"The golden heart never slumbers
So the valiant declare"

828
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,160
Karna, listen to me, idiot!

829
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,040
Who is the idiot?
Can't I pee in peace, alone?

830
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,600
You're the idiot
Clear out...out

831
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,920
Don't talk

832
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,800
At least let me sleep here

833
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,440
Forever rambling

834
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,120
Listen to my soooper idea

835
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,040
Are you listening to me?

836
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,600
This is the brainwave
of the century, listen

837
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,520
Okay, tell me

838
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,560
Everyone likes sharing good news

839
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,520
But no one likes to be
the messenger of bad news

840
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,880
Whatever bad news they can't tell,
we shall do so, instead of them

841
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,040
We charge for this service

842
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,640
They'll chase us
and break our limbs

843
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
Getting drunk and conveying
bad news alone isn't our job

844
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,360
What someone wants to tell
but is unable to...

845
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,080
...we convey on their behalf

846
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,680
I understand
whatever you're saying

847
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,840
But I don't get
the actual meaning

848
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,000
You might as well have said
you didn't get it

849
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,920
You think we'll have
many hassles due to this

850
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,440
Which business is hassle-free?

851
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,920
Only if we make mistakes
we'll be in a mess?

852
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,280
Most important, we tell bad news
but we aren't doing anything bad

853
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,920
You might think
it's simple

854
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,600
We've always got telegrams

855
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,280
Have we ever blamed the man
who delivered the shocking news?

856
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,200
Bingo?

857
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,960
That's our policy

858
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,480
Sounds good to hear

859
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,800
What's our company's name?

860
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,200
Telegram messaging service

861
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,120
Too ancient

862
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,320
Then what about TMS?

863
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,360
Too short

864
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,440
WhatsApp?

865
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,640
Thought it will sound cool and hep

866
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,720
Ultimate star headlines?

867
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,280
Sounds risky

868
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,000
Ultimate star heading our name
will give us additional weight!

869
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,120
Bravery is more important
in our business

870
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,280
How's that?

871
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,680
Fresh from the oven?

872
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,240
Not corporate enough

873
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,080
What, dude?

874
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,720
- TV messaging service?
- Sorry for the break service?

875
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,760
Brain box!

876
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,000
Basically I grew up
watching Doordarshan!

877
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,800
So we've finalized
our company name

878
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,320
When others feel shy, distressed,
depressed, disappointed to voice...

879
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,640
...we verbalize their thoughts
We charge for this service

880
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,480
But your idea has a major flaw

881
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,520
I'll clobber you
What's wrong with my idea?

882
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,040
Who is the cat we bell?!

883
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,840
Bro, 1 sambar rice

884
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,840
Hey dude!

885
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,880
Karthi...?

886
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,960
New bridegroom!
How are you?

887
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,280
I heard you lost your job?

888
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,760
You also found out

889
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,080
Facebook, huh?

890
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,120
Twitter?

891
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,600
Mail, right?

892
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,480
WhatsApp group message

893
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,120
Not covered as yet
only in the News

894
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,320
We are bachelors who will
eat at any roadside shop

895
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,800
You're newly married
Why are you eating here?

896
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,120
Why does 'sambar rice'
need symphony music?

897
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,160
How can I eat food cooked by a girl
who has never stepped into the kitchen?

898
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,560
Torture to my taste buds!

899
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,440
Is it so bad?
Why can't you tell her?

900
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,920
She'll then reply, 'do you know
what I expected in my husband?'

901
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,680
Or she'll want me to take her
on a shopping spree

902
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,520
Damned if I did
Darned if I didn't!

903
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,680
My lord!

904
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,000
What are you both
sucking up to each other?

905
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,240
Look how crass he has become
frequenting this place?

906
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,880
Senior friend is shedding tears

907
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,320
Don't deviate, my lord

908
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,800
You can't tell your wife
she's a lousy cook

909
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,160
We'll tell her
instead of you

910
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,440
She'll slipper you even before
you finish the sentence

911
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,440
Let her hit us
all she wants

912
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Which means
'charges applicable'

913
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,880
Cash?
Get lost

914
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,360
Not cash

915
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,920
You mean we are
offering free service?

916
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,040
You are our 1st client
So it's free for you

917
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,240
But you must put in a good word for us
to your friends, family and colleagues

918
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,560
Word of mouth works
That's good enough for us

919
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,960
Is this practical?

920
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,640
My friend, my lord,
is always right

921
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,960
We'll speak on your behalf

922
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,560
You can live
happily ever after

923
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,560
No, my lord-

924
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,520
How did I get your lingo?

925
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,640
Will this work, dude?

926
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,480
Remember, I stole a pencil from
Ramesh in 5th grade for you

927
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,520
And got yelled at by Rama Miss

928
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,560
We know each other
only from college

929
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,760
We'll do a good job

930
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,560
Trust us

931
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,160
You won't break us apart, will you?

932
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,720
Didn't we trust you and eat 'sambar rice'?
Shouldn't you trust us in return?

933
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,640
How can 'sambar rice' and
spouse be one and the same?

934
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,760
Din it into his head

935
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,120
Life is all about trusting

936
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,800
Okay, fine

937
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,800
Thank God!

938
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,480
Have you come
to watch a movie?

939
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,240
No, being an auspicious Friday
I wanted to pray in this temple

940
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,200
Got yourself popcorn?

941
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,240
I didn't
Why?

942
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,320
By the time you buy popcorn...

943
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,080
...I thought I'd come up
with a suitable dig at you

944
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,720
You can think while
I wait in the queue

945
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,440
I can

946
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,120
We can watch the film and
make fun of the actors instead

947
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,280
Where's Karna?

948
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
He's very busy

949
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,760
- What about you then?
- I'm equally busy

950
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,120
But I came
because you called me

951
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,000
I planned this
for all 4 of us

952
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,600
Where's Keerthi?

953
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,040
She has gone
to Coorg on work

954
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,440
1 minute

955
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,840
Arjun, Keerthi speaking
Anjali is with you, right?

956
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,000
I lost my house key
Can I talk to her?

957
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,120
Someone called Keerthi
She has lost her key it seems

958
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,720
She's standing
outside your house

959
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,840
Keerthi, when did you
get back from Coorg?

960
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,880
What are you blabbering?

961
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,520
- Where's the spare key?
- I've given it to our neighbor

962
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,640
- I never went to Coorg
- Just hang up

963
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,680
Shall I ask for the key?
I meant, popcorn

964
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,600
1 pepsi and 1 popcorn

965
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,880
Eat

966
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,200
I'll eat later, dear

967
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,600
I cooked for you

968
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,080
What happened?

969
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,960
I thought I heard
someone coming

970
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,600
No one
Eat now

971
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,360
Why can't we eat together?

972
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,080
Nothing doing, eat now

973
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,000
What?

974
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,320
Again I thought I heard
someone coming

975
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,560
Let me go and check

976
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,760
Narrow escape!

977
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,680
Who are you?

978
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,440
We are terrible terrorists

979
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,400
- What?
- Terrorists

980
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,600
What should I do?

981
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,040
Do what we say

982
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,440
What do you want?

983
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,120
'How do I answer this
all of a sudden?'

984
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,840
We haven't got instructions
from our organization as yet

985
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,200
Aren't you scared
to be a terrorist?

986
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,240
We are terrorists who are never
scared of anything anytime

987
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,120
We aren't terrified
of lions and tigers

988
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,960
But cats are a little scary

989
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
Do you know even Hitler
was scared of cats?

990
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,160
I thought it was Napoleon

991
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,480
Whoever it is
what does it matter?

992
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,160
Why is he bungling it?

993
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,880
When will you get
your command, sir?

994
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,320
He's talking too much

995
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,800
Oh my dear!

996
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,600
No, don't

997
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,520
Bro...?

998
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,840
Bro...!

999
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,280
Eat dinner and then leave

1000
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,960
This is what I was waiting for

1001
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,560
Let me serve you

1002
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,200
What happened, bro?
Is it too spicy?

1003
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,880
Maaa!

1004
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,320
Thinking of your mom?

1005
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,320
Your last birth's sins-

1006
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,760
Sincere blessing?

1007
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,280
Let me serve some more
Just one more helping

1008
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,720
Taste buds will be tortured

1009
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,120
Sambar rice is sooooper

1010
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,920
This is biriyani!

1011
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,800
Now we realize
your predicament!

1012
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,000
Poor you!

1013
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,280
Why don't you find
another wife?

1014
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,160
I felt sorry and fed you
and you dare find fault?!

1015
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,920
Did you feel sorry or you didn't
want to dump it in a trash lorry?

1016
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,440
We don't need
this life or this job

1017
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,600
Let's start a canteen and save
the lives of people like him

1018
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,040
Dear sister?

1019
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,400
Why don't you set up
a restaurant in Kashmir?

1020
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,160
You're a '1 woman army'
to save India!

1021
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,960
Sister

1022
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,600
See you

1023
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,600
Thank-

1024
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,200
"My sister softens like flowers"

1025
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,240
Whatever it is, you shouldn't
have spoken to her like that!

1026
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,400
You should be glad
all is well that ends well

1027
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,760
Look how our business
sky rockets from now on

1028
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,760
"Hoist the flag of victory
Take mountains head on bravely"

"Stretch your goal, sky is the limit
Arm your army with guns and grit-"

1030
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,560
Shut up
Look there

1031
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,800
"Who can tell news horrid
without batting an eyelid?"

1032
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,080
"In Chennai city
genie-duo are we"

1033

we'll pull our shutters down at once"

1038

Just say your piece loud and clear"

1039
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:20,600

1042
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,760
We've been facing problems
with the will for a long time

1043
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,200
My grandfather wrote
all his wealth in my name

1044
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,760
I don't want to share it
with my elder brother

1045
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,880
What should we do?

1046
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,480
'Sorry for the break' service

1047
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,520
I find it very difficult
to even talk about it

1048
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,360
My parents keep fighting daily

1049
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,600
What should we do?

1050
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:23,480
"We won't be messengers to losers
We won't lock out our customers"

1051

00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,160
Didn't see, didn't intend
telling you some bad news

1061
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,040
Sounds terrible

1062
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,560
Sorry for the break?

1063
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,840
Actually I'm engaged but my fiancee
is in love with someone else

1064
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,200
You should somehow tell
her family and stop the wedding

1065
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,200
Isn't it risky?

1066
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,600
Yes, but we will help
3 people to have better lives

1067
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,000
"To the heavy hearted
we infuse tonic tried and tested"

1068
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,120
"To apply on scalded wounds
Burnol ointment we use"

1069
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:45,080
"We don't fatten our wallet
to make lovers split or drift"

1070
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:51,680
"We don't lose our identity
despite this love-ly policy"

1071
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,640
"Sharing news rightfully yours
we are paid for this service"

1072
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,160
"Never a nuisance"

1073
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:05,360
"News...bad news to the ear
Just say your piece loud and clear"

1074
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,000
"Antony
Mark Antony"

1075
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,560
"Egg-head boss
Such a show-off"

1076
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,640
"Tomato sauce
We'll make big bucks"

1077
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,080
"Youngsters novice
Dealing massive"

1078
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,560
"Anklets enchanted
Heart extended"

1079
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:31,440
"News...bad news to the ear
Just say your piece loud and clear"

1080
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:38,360
"This is bad tidings notified
Boss, spread our fame, far and wide"

1081
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,760
Yes, we have no other
branches in Chennai

1082
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,360
Mr Parandhaman

1083
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,600
I'm duty bound to tell you
as owner of this mansion

1084
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,120
It's 10:00 p.m now
Shut shop and out you go

1085
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,560
Don't want to go into the wrong
wedding hall, like in the movies

1086
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,440
Srinivas gave the invitation

1087
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,160
Right wedding hall

1088
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,040
Names of the bride and
bridegroom are also right

1089
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,000
What else do we need?

1090
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,040
Let's go, right!

1091
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,320
I think that's him

1092
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,920
Are you my father?

1093
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,720
I mean are you
the bridegroom's father?

1094
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,600
What can I do for you?

1095
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,000
We have some bad news for you

1096
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,960
Bad news on an auspicious day?

1097
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,200
Not just today, but we are here
wishing every day is good for you

1098
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,800
You're confusing me

1099
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,360
We'll keep it short and simple
Please don't be shocked

1100
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,120
The bride loves someone else

1101
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,680
Her parents didn't accept her choice

1102
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,720
So she agreed
with a heavy heart

1103
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,200
If you get your son married
to an unwilling bride...

1104
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,680
...how can your son
be happy, sir?

1105
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,280
Who told you all this?

1106
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,720
Who are you?

1107
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,160
More than who we are,
what matters is our message

1108
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,120
Yes, dad?

1109
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,760
They claim the bride
is in love with someone else

1110
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,480
Actually-

1111
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,480
Tell me

1112
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,280
I heard about it too, dad
But I don't know if it's true

1113
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,680
Call the bride's father

1114
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,240
What is it, my dear in-law?

1115
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,080
I don't want
anything to do with you

1116
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,080
What's the problem?
Why are you angry?

1117
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,440
Your daughter is in love
with some chap it seems

1118
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,280
My daughter doesn't
love anyone, sir

1119
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,400
Who told you this?

1120
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,800
It isn't important who told me

1121
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:25,920
Tell me if it is true or not

1122
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,360
You thought
you could hide this

1123
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,640
I swear we didn't

1124
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,040
And thought you could dump
your girl on our son's head

1125
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,160
Maybe what we are doing is wrong

1126
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,960
This is business

1127
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,560
True, but still-

1128
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,600
We've saved
the lives of 3 people

1129
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,680
At least accept this fact now

1130
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,200
My daughter isn't
in love with anyone

1131
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,920
Let me know if you have
any other ulterior reason

1132
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,160
We want your daughter to speak up

1133
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,200
I'll myself tell you

1134
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,240
Uncle, I'm not in love with anyone

1135
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,520
If you ask her in front of everyone
naturally this is what she'll say

1136
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,760
Be brave and own up

1137
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,200
Who told you this?

1138
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,720
Is that important?

1139
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,840
Now we are aware
So come out with it

1140
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,680
Why be scared?

1141
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,320
I don't need to be
scared of anyone

1142
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,080
If I did love someone
I'd tell my dad myself

1143
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,280
That's how my dad
has brought me up

1144
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,240
How do we believe this?

1145
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,920
What if you ran away with
that chap after you're married?

1146
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,800
Watch your tongue

1147
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,880
Dad, leave it

1148
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,160
Let's go

1149
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,840
Let them go

1150
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,400
Hi glam-ma
How are you?

1151
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,560
Top of the world

1152
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,040
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine

1153
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:24,920
Why are you yelling?

1154
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,880
Okay, I'll talk softly

1155
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,000
Can you hear me?

1156
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,120
Loud and clear, glam-ma

1157
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,560
Just a little cold here
Otherwise I'm fine

1158
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,040
Where's gramps?

1159
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:41,600
Daily he walks, jogs, talks
to all the white chicks here

1160
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,120
What, sweetie?
You're falling down-

1161
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,600
Are you falling at my feet
to get my blessing?

1162
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,280
Look how our grandson-

1163
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,240
He has probably got
some booze underneath

1164
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,760
You can't sleep in peace
if you don't deride him

1165
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,720
Ignore him

1166
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,120
Don't fall at my feet, dear

1167
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,520
Here, touch my hand
and I'll bless you

1168
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,960
Ok, glam-ma

1169
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,240
Hello, how are you?

1170
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,360
Fit as a fiddle
How are you?

1171
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,320
I can see that

1172
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,200
Where are you
staying now, my dear?

1173
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,320
Karna's house, obviously

1174
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,280
Did you think
I had no place to go?

1175
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,280
- Height of anger, huh?
- Naturally!

1176
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,240
Keep quiet

1177
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,760
Your grandpa hasn't rented the flat

1178
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,640
Watchman has the key

1179
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,040
- Take it from him
- Keep quiet

1180
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:23,920
No need

1181
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,800
I'm happy at Karna's place
I'll stay here

1182
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,440
Let me see who is calling

1183
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,000
So what are you doing now?

1184
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,320
I've started my own
business now, gramps

1185
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,880
I'm busy and it is
going great guns

1186
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,520
- Really?
- Cross my heart, gramps

1187
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,640
Do you know what you're doing
or are you just having a go-

1188
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,080
Who are you? (Hindi)

1189
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,400
No (Hindi)

1190
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,360
Wait a minute

1191
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,960
Who is it?

1192
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,560
Some chap about repairing
the washing machine it seems

1193
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,120
Why are you speaking
to him in Hindi now?

1194
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,320
Because he doesn't
know Tamil you see!

1195
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,880
What's all that smoke?

1196
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,800
Must be incense powder

1197
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,440
Yes, we lit some
incense cones

1198
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,040
He didn't leave
even he gets the key

1199
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,400
Wonder when he'll leave my house-

1200
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,280
Bye, gramps
Catch you later

1201
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,280
Idiot! Aren't you ashamed?

1202
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,680
Basically when it comes to booze
my family gives it absolute priority

1203
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,200
Booze all you want, you bozo!

1204
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,080
I've been looking for you all over

1205
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,200
What's up now?

1206
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,480
Remember Srinivas?
We stopped his wedding

1207
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,480
Yes, what's happened to him?

1208
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,800
His fiancee was right

1209
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,960
I can't pay you now

1210
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,320
I don't want your damn money

1211
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,640
Just tell me the truth

1212
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,960
Didn't you blame the girl unfairly
because you loved someone else?

1213
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,600
Yes, so what?

1214
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,240
Her family didn't deserve this

1215
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,080
I can't live happily
if I'm concerned about them

1216
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,160
Such a wimp! He turned the tables
on us and made us the scapegoat

1217
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,520
Because of us that family was
humiliated in front of everyone

1218
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,360
Let's go and tell them the truth

1219
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,720
How can we do that?

1220
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,720
We have to
No other go

1221
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,160
Let's go right now
Thanks, bro

1222
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,240
Did you confirm the address?

1223
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,560
I went to the wedding hall
and got the address

1224
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,360
One look at us, I feel
they'll be fuming mad

1225
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,640
Don't worry
They won't

1226
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,200
They'll definitely stone us dead!

1227
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,640
I have to tell you
something important

1228
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,840
Any hassles we face
in our business...

1229
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,000
...you get the blows
and all the brickbats

1230
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,080
How can you say this?

1231
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,320
Why should I get the brunt of it?

1232
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,200
Ring the bell

1233
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,760
I get the death knell
So you ring the bell

1234
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,000
Is this the time
for 'punch dialogs'?

1235
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:26,920
It just flows from within!

1236
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,920
I'm postponing being hit

1237
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,880
10:30 to 12:00 is
inauspicious time

1238
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,800
We'll come back later

1239
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,040
Wait for God's sake

1240
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,760
Looks like he won't
budge from here

1241
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,320
There isn't anyone at home

1242
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,480
We'll come again
another day

1243
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,640
Shut up and wait

1244
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,880
I'll prove it to you

1245
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,440
- What are you trying to do?
- Darshini, open the door

1246
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,360
He's knocking like as if
the door will scream in pain!

1247
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,840
No one opened
Let's go

1248
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,280
What are you doing here?

1249
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,280
'Dude, we are screwed!'

1250
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,240
Patient has to sleep
Will you leave the room?

1251
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,760
Sir, see you later

1252
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,480
Will you leave at once
just because he said so?

1253
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,320
I like your interval block a lot
So complete your story

1254
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,200
Let me just smoke
1 cigarette and be back

1255
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,160
Why a cigarette when
the break got over just now?

1256
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,760
How was Anjali in that house?

1257
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,520
Anjali, what are you doing here?

1258
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,720
I should be asking you this

1259
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,880
What are you doing here?

1260
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,640
You might as well have
said 'same to you'

1261
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,240
I'm saying it now
Same to you

1262
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,600
First tell me why
you landed at my doorstep!

1263
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,040
Whaaat?
This is your house?

1264
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,400
Oh gawd! He meant
'Is this your house?'

1265
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,320
He got it wrong

1266
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,560
Can I get some water to drink?

1267
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,600
Why don't you come in?

1268
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,000
We haven't washed our socks
We'll wait outside

1269
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,840
Something is wrong

1270
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,040
I got the address
from the wedding hall

1271
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,480
You confirmed her father's name

1272
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:01,480
Then between Anjali and
the inmates of this house...

1273
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,040
...there is some connection

1274
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,120
Why are you deriding me?

1275
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,720
Watch how well I handle it
You retain your emotional quotient

1276
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,040
Water

1277
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,960
Actually I wanted to
ask you something

1278
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:12,800
But he'll ask you

1279
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,440
I knew this was your house
Just thought we'll play the fool

1280
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,760
You knew beforehand this is-

1281
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,080
All that's fine but tell me
why did you come here?

1282
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,520
Just to surprise you

1283
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,200
Surprise?!

1284
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,720
When you opened the door
didn't we say, 'is this your house'?

1285
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,840
Surprise, right?

1286
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,840
Don't be silly!

1287
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,920
Shall we go out?

1288
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,320
Let's sit in here and talk

1289
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,160
True, she's right
Why go out?

1290
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,800
No, I'm hungry

1291
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,600
If you agree,
we can go out and eat

1292
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,600
1 minute

1293
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,520
We stopped her sister's wedding

1294
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,760
Her whole family will recognize us

1295
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,520
Let's think of a way
to escape from here!

1296
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,640
Stopped the wedding
How could you?

1297
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,040
You talk as if I did it
single-handedly?

1298
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,360
You fell in love
single handed

1299
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,520
Then what are you saying?

1300
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,880
Actually this place
inspires my creativity

1301
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,680
Only hassle, when I want to
pen it down, the words get stuc-

1302
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,960
Shall we go?

1303
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,840
Okay

1304
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,960
This looks like a popular program
on Doordarshan about farming

1305
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,800
Was there a wedding
in your family last week?

1306
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,560
Yes, who told you?

1307
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,720
You answer my question

1308
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,760
Karna will answer
your questions!

1309
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,880
You're getting me drowned

1310
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,280
Think and you can swim out of it

1311
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,000
Answer my question first
How did you get to know?

1312
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,280
When we were finding the way
to your house, an elderly man said...

1313
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:31,360
'...is it the house where
a wedding took place recently?'

1314
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,160
He wouldn't have said that

1315
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,160
The wedding was stopped

1316
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,440
The wedding was stopped, huh?

1317
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,360
Don't over react

1318
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,680
Was the wedding stopped?

1319
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,640
What a pity!

1320
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,120
My sister's wedding

1321
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,560
Your sister?
Real sister?

1322
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,000
If born before her, sister
If born with her, twin

1323
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,840
Actress Shakila's eatery

1324
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,520
No, the owner is
a big fan of hers

1325
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,840
Bro, 3 plates 'Appam'

1326
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,960
- What happened-
- Will you serve coconut milk?

1327
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,280
With coconut milk

1328
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,280
Why didn't you invite us
for your sister's wedding?

1329
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,760
What does it matter?

1330
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,080
Even if you had come...

1331
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,160
...as if the wedding
would've taken place?

1332
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,200
Definitely it would've happened

1333
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,280
Actually the story is different

1334
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,400
Basically in my family
if there's any confusion...

1335
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,920
...we are kings at convincing!

1336
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,600
Tell your sis, if she doesn't get
pancake with coconut milk...

1337
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,640
...she can always choose
pancake with spicy curry

1338
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,400
Arjun, I'm leaving
Cancel my order

1339
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,040
How could you?

1340
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,200
Don't want

1341
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,400
Come, let's both eat

1342
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,840
Pancake and fritters?

1343
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,480
Anjali, depressed?

1344
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,040
No, I'm livid with anger

1345
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,400
They've done this without even
thinking they are ruining a girl's life

1346
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,280
Correct, should have thought

1347
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,680
Do you know the repercussions?

1348
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,840
What happened?

1349
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,360
Nothing

1350
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,120
Okay, forget that

1351
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,920
I don't know if I am surprised
or shocked by your sudden arrival

1352
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,320
You could say,
'feeling best'

1353
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,240
What?

1354
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,800
Glamor joke
I mean grammar joke

1355
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,360
Not in a mood to laugh

1356
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,160
I understand your feelings
But you shouldn't bottle it inside

1357
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,360
You should express it

1358
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,800
Don't know if I can so soon

1359
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,840
With my parents on one side
and my sister on the other...

1360
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,760
...they beat a soap opera hollow!

1361
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,760
I'm going mad
being all by myself

1362
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,120
Thank God you're here

1363
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,640
Why this formality between us?

1364
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,720
Between us?

1365
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,280
Forget that

1366
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,720
Why didn't you call me
for your sister's wedding?

1367
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,000
I would have been forced to
introduce you to my family

1368
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,280
So what?

1369
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,320
How do I introduce you, as who?

1370
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,880
So who am I to you?

1371
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,400
See you

1372
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,120
We should have confided in Anjali

1373
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,080
How come we didn't meet
Anjali on that day?

1374
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,280
She must have been busy
arranging stuff for her sister

1375
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,440
Good thing we didn't

1376
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,040
Isn't she coming in to eat?

1377
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:00,880
No

1378
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,600
Why is it happening to us?
We've never harmed anyone

1379
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,320
I've told you not to lament, right?

1380
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,400
I can't step outside

1381
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,240
Everyone asks only about this to me

1382
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,080
Let them talk
whatever they want

1383
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,640
Your age makes you think that way

1384
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,000
I'm your father, dear
I worry about what has happened

1385
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,000
None of the guests believed us

1386
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,000
Only we know
what they said was false

1387
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,000
It's enough if we know, dad

1388
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,560
This isn't Chennai, dear

1389
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,160
How many people should we go
and defend ourselves to?

1390
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,520
That isn't necessary

1391
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,720
You have to come out of this
as quick as you can

1392
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,120
For Darshini's sake

1393
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,840
Why don't you all come and stay
with me in Chennai for some time?

1394
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,920
People will accuse us
of running away

1395
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,160
Daaad!

1396
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,600
You take Darshini
back to Chennai with you

1397
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,600
Okay

1398
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,360
When Anjali was away
weren't you bored?

1399
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,520
We have friends
in the opposite block

1400
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,000
'Friends' means?

1401
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,000
They don't go to work

1402
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,760
They run their own business

1403
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,280
They'll come running
whenever Anjali calls

1404
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,600
Half the time 'madam'
lives in their house!

1405
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,320
With 2 boys?

1406
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,120
They are very decent

1407
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,240
One is Karna
Forever cracking jokes

1408
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,680
You can't miss his nose
Like Mr Bean

1409
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,640
The other one?

1410
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,600
His name...Rajeev...Rakesh?

1411
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,920
Very intelligent
He claims that himself!

1412
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,920
Smart and a chatterbox

1413
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,960
Holds a PhD in poor jokes!

1414
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,880
Fallen flat, huh?

1415
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,600
Yes

1416
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,680
Nothing of that sort

1417
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,960
It's getting late for you

1418
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,680
- Leave now
- Okay, bye

1419
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,040
Take a seat

1420
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,880
- Karna
- I'm Arjun

1421
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:56,800
Coffee

1422
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,000
We drank, sir

1423
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,600
- We never smoke
- It seems, sir

1424
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,360
Smoking is also
like falling in love

1425
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,080
You'll be bugged
when you smoke

1426
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,840
But you won't be
able to give it up

1427
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,240
Beautifully said, sir

1428
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,920
I fell in love and got married

1429
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,560
While I was in college

1430
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,440
And a successful marriage

1431
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,520
After so many years
I'm searching for that love

1432
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,720
Don't understand

1433
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,840
That's my evergreen college days

1434
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,000
My girl friend and I used to
frequent park, beach-

1435
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,320
Sir...sir, no time

1436
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,920
Just say it in 3 words

1437
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,600
3 words only

1438
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,080
Loved, married, left

1439
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,040
How can you find your love
after so many years, sir?

1440
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,040
Why not, sir?

1441
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,320
Don't people get divorced
when they are 50-60 years old?

1442
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,760
You want us to tell your wife
that you want to divorce her?

1443
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,960
Not necessary at all

1444
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,480
I don't love my wife one bit now

1445
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,640
You must tell her this
in a way she can understand

1446
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,240
That's why I called you here

1447
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,720
This seems a very sensitive issue

1448
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,520
That's why I selected you
for your new service

1449
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,880
Our fees will be
on the higher side

1450
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,680
Charge whatever you want

1451
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,720
Why are you both silent?

1452
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,080
No...nothing, sir
Can I have some water?

1453
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,200
I'll get it for you

1454
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,920
Look over there

1455
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,400
This man and his wife

1456
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,680
Do you know her?

1457
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,800
Idiot! Look above that

1458
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,760
Is that lady dead?

1459
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,400
Sssshhhhh!
Maybe she is his 2nd wife?

1460
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,720
This guy doesn't look like
he can have 2 wives

1461
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,520
From what he spoke...

1462
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,000
...she doesn't look
like his 2nd wife either

1463
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,160
Sorry, sonny

1464
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,480
No ice water

1465
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,680
I don't keep water in the fridge

1466
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,760
My wife will scold me,
worried I'll catch a cold

1467
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,800
Which wife, sir?

1468
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,480
I got only 1 wife

1469
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,440
The one in the photo

1470
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,120
But you've garlanded the photo

1471
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:02,640
She died many years ago
That's why her photo is garlanded

1472
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,080
If I don't garland her
even then she will yell at me

1473
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,320
Sometimes people like you will ask me
why there's a garland round her photo?

1474
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,200
She'll yell at them also

1475
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,320
- What are you saying, sir?
- I didn't ask, he did, sir

1476
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,480
She's very short-fused

1477
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,440
Don't misunderstand me

1478
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,520
Is it many years
since your wife died?

1479
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,240
Is she the one yelling at you?

1480
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,760
Is she the one you are
no longer in love with?

1481
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,480
Is she the one with
a short-fused temper?

1482
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,480
Is she the one we should
convey your message?

1483
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,600
Will you answer the next
question also with a 'yes'?

1484
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,120
We can't be of help to you

1485
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,080
How can you just get up and go?

1486
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:31,840
Sit down

1487
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,640
What do you expect
us to say, sir?

1488
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,120
How can we talk to the dead?

1489
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,440
Are you saying you can't?

1490
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,680
Who can talk to the dead, sir?

1491
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,760
I'm talking to her

1492
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,560
In fact even my wife talks
to some of our visitors

1493
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,480
Why don't you have a debate then?

1494
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,960
Conversations with ghost, huh?

1495
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,760
We'll convey your message to her

1496
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,480
But you shouldn't
be here when we do

1497
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,200
If you are okay with it
we accept this assignment

1498
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,320
Same way, if she
doesn't leave you...

1499
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,760
...even after we tell her
we aren't responsible

1500
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,640
How can you regard conversations
with a ghost as an assignment?

1501
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,440
Even I haven't reprimanded my wife
by calling her a 'spirit'

1502
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,560
I've always called her
'Ramani dumpling'

1503
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,600
Dumpling or darling

1504
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,560
Karna, I disapprove of you
deriding our client's wife

1505
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,640
Shut up your mouth

1506
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,680
Dump a pot over your head,
you uncouth youth!

1507
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,600
During the day time
this house seemed normal

1508
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,000
Why does it look eerie now?

1509
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,280
It will be fine if we
switch on the light

1510
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:31,520
'Praise be to Lord Aiyappa'

1511
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,640
How come you've suddenly
become very religious?

1512
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,000
Devotion and fear
go hand in hand

1513
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,240
Our news service
is in tatters

1514
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,040
It's in rags from the beginning!

1515
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,760
Her name doesn't sound
like a spirit at all

1516
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,960
'Praise be to Lord Aiyappa'

1517
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,560
That man is so confident
she speaks to him often

1518
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,040
All that is an illusion
Fertile imagination

1519
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,680
We go in, sit and watch a film
Enjoy, then go back home

1520
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,920
Tomorrow we can tell Mr Raman
we spoke to her and did our bit

1521
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,400
I'm sure what you say
will be right, my lord

1522
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,600
TV isn't working
Go and check

1523
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,120
You come with me too

1524
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,720
Switch it on
Don't glare at me

1525
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,320
Switch off the light

1526
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,680
It's too dark, please

1527
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:43,000
Watching a film in the dark
is a thrill so special

1528
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,320
Switch it off, I say

1529
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,200
'Let go of him'

1530
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,080
Popcorn-

1531
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,040
Is this a ghost movie?

1532
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,280
Who said a ghost will appear
if you watch a ghost movie?

1533
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,280
Don't you get all witty
when you watch a comedy?

1534
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,680
Then if you watch a porn film-

1535
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,560
There's logic at least
in what I'm saying

1536
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,000
Shut up and just watch

1537
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:13,080
'Bhai, don't you have
work to do in your mosque?'

1538
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,960
'Instead of praying there
why are you playing here?'

1539
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,600
Who are you?

1540
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,320
What's wrong with you?

1541
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,240
Ramani dumpling!

1542
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:42,240
"Ramani dumpling, darling Ramani"

1543
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,520
Nutcase

1544
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,840
I just shouted for fun

1545
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,360
Imbeciles!
Why are you screaming?

1546
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,840
1st time we are seeing a ghost
face to face, so out of sheer fear-

1547
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,480
Who said if you see a ghost
you must scream like a banshee?

1548
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,520
Blockheads!

1549
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,400
They are scaring me out of my skin!

1550
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,720
Are you a good ghost
or a bad ghost?

1551
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,800
I don't know

1552
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,680
One day, before
I became a ghost...

1553
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,440
...a grandma was
frying fritter-

1554
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,440
In your family everyone grabs
flashback rights at the drop of a hat!

1555
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,600
Question was only whether
you are good or bad!

1556
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,440
If you call me a ghost once more
I'll stamp you as flat as a pancake

1557
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:49,000
I have a soooper name
Call me Ramani dumpling!

1558
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,680
He reminds me of the way
my husband used to call me

1559
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,360
Speaking of husband...

1560
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,560
...he says he doesn't love you
then why are you disturbing him?

1561
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,200
What is your problem?

1562
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,600
Let me ask you this

1563
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:09,000
When you're boozing is it wrong
to make an omelette to go with it?

1564
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,800
Is it wrong to scrub your back
when you're in the shower?

1565
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,320
No, as long as it isn't my back!

1566
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,600
Don't be silly

1567
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,640
Is it a crime to give a tablet at
bed time to control blood pressure?

1568
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,800
100% not wrong

1569
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,600
Who will do all this
other than a wife?

1570
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,600
Who else can?

1571
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,400
Even the Supreme court
cannot fault you, sister

1572
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,200
Parrot-nose pansy!

1573
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,000
But you're a ghost
How can you-

1574
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,920
If I hear you refer to me
as ghost once more-

1575
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,520
I'll send messages to all my friends
in whatsApp and host a party here

1576
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,440
Oh no...no...don't
Sorry, madam

1577
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,960
So you won't leave him
once and for all?

1578
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,760
Everybody has to go one day

1579
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,440
Even he has to come to me one day

1580
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,360
We'll convey the same to him, madam

1581
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,840
Shall we convey it?

1582
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,080
Let's go, dude

1583
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,880
Wait, I have a doubt to clear

1584
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,760
Do ghosts wear the same costume?

1585
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,240
Don't you shop for clothes?

1586
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,400
Send whatsApp message

1587
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,600
We go by whatever color
our designer decides

1588
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,760
Even ghosts have desi-

1589
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,960
You dare call me a ghost again

1590
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,400
Get lost

1591
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:08,960
Come quickly

1592
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,840
Glam-ma has said we should run away
without a second glance if we see a ghost

1593
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,440
Don't call me a ghost again-

1594
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,360
Let's go

1595
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,080
Why this sudden questioning of
my welfare when we met this morning?

1596
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,160
What else?

1597
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,400
Nothing

1598
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,400
What's the matter?

1599
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,520
Nothing

1600
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,400
Actually there is something

1601
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,120
1 minute

1602
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,440
We can't go in search of love

1603
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,520
If we do, actually-

1604
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,800
What do you mean 'oho'?

1605
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,000
I don't look at you like that

1606
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,680
'How sad!'

1607
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,440
Actually I'm in love
with someone else

1608
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,880
Now I get it

1609
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,600
That girl loves you

1610
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,640
Triangular love

1611
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,400
Like veteran director Sridhar's films

1612
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,600
That's where you're wrong

1613
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,560
She actually loves another guy

1614
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,840
In the wedding feast of
affluent families, they will pile...

1615
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,800
...all kinds of sweets
with multi courses to eat

1616
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:39,640
Like that you're stacking new
characters at every point in your story

1617
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,160
Too many characters
will cause a hiccup

1618
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,840
See how I continue
with no hitches

1619
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,680
Doesn't matter

1620
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,040
I take back my 'doesn't matter'

1621
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,360
Why did you apologize?

1622
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,720
Because you may be hurt

1623
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,360
How does it concern you?

1624
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,680
I'd like to know this
out of curiosity

1625
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,720
Until we propose...

1626
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,440
...how is it we are in the dark
about your boyfriends?

1627
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,640
When we do, a fiance in
your hometown or in USA...

1628
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,400
...will suddenly crop up
out of nowhere

1629
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,480
You could have said this
before we started flirting

1630
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,040
When did I flirt with you?

1631
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,000
When I sent you a message...

1632
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:22,600
...you replied with a smiley
Isn't that leading me on?

1633
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,640
No, Karna

1634
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,880
I've paid the bill

1635
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,360
Wait...wait

1636
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,200
Dating her, huh?

1637
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,200
First find out
if she has a boyfriend?

1638
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,920
He doesn't know about you

1639
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,680
Date, huh?

1640
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,200
Just Rs 10

1641
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,400
Enough

1642
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,160
As long as you're happy, fine

1643
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,000
Just spend Rs 10
to make a girl happy

1644
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,400
What's the surprise?

1645
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,360
If I tell you, how will it
be a surprise?

1646
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,080
No limits for your arrogance

1647
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,520
Limited only
Just 3 words

1648
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,600
Like it?

1649
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,920
Wait...wait

1650
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,080
Don't go

1651
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,360
My dear chrysanthemum

1652
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,160
A flower even more beautiful than you
will make you fade into oblivion

1653
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,480
Shall we go?

1654
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,280
1 minute

1655
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,960
Soooper surprise
I'm so touched

1656
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,840
Wait for the real surprise

1657
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,720
It isn't happening!!

1658
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,960
What's wrong with you?

1659
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,320
Rakkamma, clap your hands

1660
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,920
Nothing happened

1661
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,000
My inner wounds will be
healed automatically

1662
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:00,880
Let's go

1663
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,040
I realize you were trying something

1664
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,120
Forget the slip

1665
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,760
Folk dance?
You wretched friend, Karna!

1666
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,960
Did she fall flat for you?

1667
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,680
How will she flip?
She will only flop!

1668
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,040
Wrong number, huh?

1669
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:39,240
For your paltry 2000 bucks
think you can get A.R.Rahman?!

1670
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,840
Just hang up

1671
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,040
Shall we go?

1672
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,840
1 more minute

1673
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,320
Simply 3 words
that I intended telling you

1674
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,600
I thought something else

1675
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,120
Ages since I laughed my heart out

1676
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,240
Why a formal 'thanks' between us?

1677
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,080
You are late in everything

1678
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,120
How long it took
for you to say this?

1679
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,320
All this is fine,
but only one thing counts

1680
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,040
A bigger surprise than this?

1681
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:41,840
Whether you surprise me or not
you should be honest with me

1682
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,320
You will, won't you?

1683
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,440
I agreed

1684
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,520
Actually I have-

1685
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,280
"From sky's palette, get blues light
From cottony clouds afar, peel white"

1686
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,920
"Weaving a costume
longer than time"

1687
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,160
"With my love branded
into your hands I handed"

1688
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:48,640
"With both your hands to hug me
no fancy dress necessary"

1689
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:54,480
"Shall I search high and low until
I find the best peacock feathered quill?"

1690
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:59,680
"Shall I pave the roads with paper
to laud you like poet laureate Kambar?"

1691
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:04,120
"Enough if both your eyes look at me
and you profess your love truly"

1692
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:07,840
"Why strain and stress
to look for words complex?"

1693
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,720
"Hey saayore saayore"

1694
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:11,800
(clears throat)

1695
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,280
"I assure
From a land pure"

1696
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,840
"Holding drizzle sprays
Folding my heart in place"

1697
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,680
"Lust from my love I sieved and sifted
And in your hands I specially gifted"

1698
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,880
"Paragraphs of words
in your throat you stored"

1699
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:51,480
"Through my lashes that flash
my love I simply splash"

1700
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:56,360
"In your words of poetry
I bury myself delightedly"

1701
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:01,120
"Why bury yourself in me?
Sow your seed in my soul solely"

1702
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:06,360
"With bedewed kisses in love's breeze
blossom as a flower within me please"

1703
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,240
"As love birds tipsy
in love will we be?"

1704
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,520
'Can you fall in love
only if drunk?'

1705
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,120
'Otherwise I'm not beautiful?'

1706
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:31,200
'Not like that...!'

1707
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:35,920
"In your beauty, dazed and dizzy
I fall repeatedly, my dear missy"

1708
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,280
'1st of all, love isn't
a dizzy feeling'

1709
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,440
'Secondly, beauty isn't
what you see on the exterior'

1710
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,120
'Thirdly, you don't have to fall in love'

1711
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:53,040
"I discovered you belong to me
I heard words your eyes spoke finally"

1712
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:57,960
"Love's meaning I realized fully
I accepted you as you are totally"

1713
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:02,560
"With our eyes immersed in each other
I promise I'll love you forever"

1714
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:07,920
"I won't be distressed
and stress to look for words complex?"

1715
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,200
"Saayore saayore
My soul knows to inlay"

1716
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,720
"Your smile however slight
my wings take flight"

1717
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:25,160
"In the silence of our kiss
my love you'll realize"

1718
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,320
"My beloved
My love loved"

1719
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:54,200
Long live Veerasami 'anna'

1720
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,800
Look at the set up
and our get up

1721
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:59,120
What are we doing here?

1722
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,240
Ramasamy is a big wig here

1723
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,880
His son is Veeradheera
Parakrama Siva Subra-

1724
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,880
Say it sweet and short
in 3 simple words only

1725
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,000
Look over there
Veerasami bro

1726
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:35,000
Like father like son
It is so obvious

1727
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,480
That's where you're wrong

1728
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,440
Ramasamy's son isn't Veersami

1729
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,200
Picked him up from a trash can

1730
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,640
This is as lame as
a flashback 20 years ago

1731
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,760
Naturally it will be out dated

1732
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,840
Our assignment is to tell
this matter to Veerasami

1733
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,480
Let his father tell him
he was adopted

1734
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,520
Don't you want your interview
splashed all over India today?

1735
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,360
Shouldn't we be alive
to give an interview?

1736
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,280
- That's true
- Hit him

1737
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,320
Look over there

1738
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,960
With 1 swift blow
scrape his intestines out

1739
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:05,760
Looks so frightening

1740
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,680
I took an advance payment
from Mr Ramaswamy

1741
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,480
Okay, we'll do it

1742
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,760
Why this sudden decision?

1743
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,200
I have a brilliant idea
Your jaw line is sure to drop

1744
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:16,880
Is that so?

1745
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,080
Soooper
1 minute

1746
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,600
Let's go

1747
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:27,280
Take him alone and remove
his liver alone cleverly

1748
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,840
Thinks he can get away
acting smart with me?!

1749
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,200
Bro...?

1750
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:36,720
I'm busy
Don't disturb me

1751
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,120
They are to the left

1752
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:42,920
What's the matter?

1753
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,080
We've come to
break you up, sir

1754
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,360
We're from 'Sorry for the break' service!

1755
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,400
Means?

1756
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:51,680
Sorry for the disturbance

1757
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,760
Say it the way I can
understand in Tamil!

1758
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,600
We've brought you news, sir

1759
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,800
What news?

1760
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,400
Don't know how to say it

1761
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,520
Hearing your news
if I'm smiling...

1762
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,160
...exit is this way

1763
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:11,760
If I become serious
exit is to heaven

1764
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,600
Which do you prefer?

1765
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,480
Spill it out

1766
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,600
Is this your dropped jaw line idea?

1767
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,640
Spare the dumb chap

1768
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,840
Take care of the jabber mouth!

1769
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,800
I am just the messenger

1770
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,720
You hit me before I could say it

1771
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,160
Headlines or head-less news?

1772
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,520
'Why am I laughing alone?'

1773
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:52,920
Your father...

1774
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,760
...I wanted to say
is a good hearted soul

1775
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,320
Whole village knows that

1776
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,440
Similarly, your mother-

1777
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,960
Is equivalent to a Goddess

1778
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,800
Can build a temple for her

1779
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:05,800
Temple

1780
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,240
For my mother?

1781
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,600
Huge temple

1782
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,360
Too much of sentiment
Do something

1783
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,520
He's talking
all of a sudden

1784
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,520
I'm able to speak

1785
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,520
I can talk

1786
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,560
You made me talk

1787
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,400
You aren't an ordinary human being

1788
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,080
You're a son...son of a-

1789
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,520
Supreme son of a normal being

1790
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,880
A temple should be built for you
Even if not huge, a small one

1791
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,800
Temple...?

1792
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,520
They want to build
a temple for me

1793
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,240
How will the village take it?

1794
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,680
Go ahead, do it

1795
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,000
Long live Veerasami 'anna'

1796
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:20,000
Long live rowdy!
Veerasami 'anna'

1797
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,560
Long live

1798
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:23,520
Sonny...!

1799
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:28,360
You're a divine being
Your father is a human being

1800
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,640
How can a human be
a father to this divine being?

1801
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,320
What are you trying to say?

1802
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,760
Your father-

1803
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,080
My dad?

1804
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,320
Your father-

1805
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,440
Not yours

1806
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:46,360
Veerasami, they spoke the truth

1807
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,120
You are not my son

1808
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,280
God chose us
and gave you to us

1809
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,120
I am not your son?

1810
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,200
God's gift?

1811
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,960
Look how he's disowning me

1812
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,320
Get lost, old man

1813
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,080
My heart is aching

1814
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,120
Temple for you

1815
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,280
Let's go while the going is good

1816
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,080
I shouldn't cry

1817
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,240
Karthik told me
about your service

1818
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,360
To tell you in short
about our company

1819
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,240
Actually if you just tell us
why you called us here-

1820
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,800
According to Indian economic-

1821
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,120
We understand English

1822
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,840
If you could tell us
what you want us to do

1823
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:05,400
He's repeating
Facebook status to us

1824
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,600
In our campus recruitment...

1825
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,680
...we had promised jobs
for some students

1826
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,960
We couldn't keep up our promise

1827
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:21,880
You have to convey this to
the recruits through your service

1828
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,000
It's a serious sensitive
information we have to convey

1829
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,480
Must handle it carefully

1830
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,840
Don't forget to record
We need to show proof to our client

1831
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:54,960
Thank God
I clean forgot

1832
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,040
We don't know how they will react
to what we say, so whatever it is...

1833
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,040
...be prepared

1834
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:02,560
Whatever the reason don't tell them
as soon as they open the door

1835
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,280
'Your son has lost his job'

1836
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,160
This was what
I told you not to tell

1837
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,320
Sorry for the break

1838
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,600
Didn't your son get a job
through campus placement?

1839
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,200
Yes

1840
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,760
That job has been withdrawn

1841
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,160
Don't you have a conscience?

1842
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,040
You know what we've gone through
to get our daughter educated?

1843
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:19,200
Then why did you get a written declaration
from me not to attend any other interview?

1844
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:22,200
It isn't our fault
We are just the messengers

1845
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:23,280
Don't worry, dear

1846
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,400
If not this, then you'll get another job

1847
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,320
I'll bruise you black and blue

1848
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:27,960
Clear off

1849
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,400
If you yell at us
what can we do?

1850
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,760
Our whole family is
dependent only on this job

1851
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,400
I curse you with
ill-will and resentment

1852
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:36,560
You both won't prosper
You'll rot in hell

1853
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:37,600
So sorry

1854
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,280
Don't feel bad
Next stop is K.K Nagar

1855
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,320
Enough

1856
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,240
We've been paid for the job
We don't have a choice

1857
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,840
Enough for today

1858
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,440
Hi Kavi
How are you?

1859
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,040
I'm fine
How are you?

1860
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:56,720
I'm okay

1861
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,960
How are gramps and glam-ma?

1862
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,160
Grandma has hurt her leg

1863
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,760
For 1 second, she was
in excruciating pain

1864
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,440
What happened?

1865
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:02,360
- Don't get tensed
- How?

1866
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,280
Told her not to go for a walk
since the weather is bad

1867
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:05,600
- She didn't listen
- What happened?

1868
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,520
It's a minor sprain

1869
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:10,560
- Let me talk to glam-ma
- They are still at the clinic

1870
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,480
Ask glam-ma to call me
as soon as she can

1871
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:13,440
Take care of them

1872
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,680
I'll ask them to come
on Skype at night

1873
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,560
What happened?

1874
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:18,720
Glam ma has hurt her leg

1875
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:19,640
How did it happen?

1876
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,600
When?

1877
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,760
Not to worry

1878
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:25,640
She just cursed us

1879
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,920
Don't take all this seriously

1880
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:31,920
It isn't right
None of this is right

1881
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
See you

1882
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,080
Where are you go-

1883
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,960
Anjali, I was the one who
stopped your sister's wedding

1884
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,320
I have to tell you
something important

1885
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:42,000
What are you doing here?

1886
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,400
I came to see you
Shall we go out?

1887
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,360
Too much work to be done
We'll go in the evening

1888
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:47,480
Come inside

1889
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,480
Whatever is happening
around me is wrong, Anjali

1890
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:53,920
I don't know what to do

1891
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,800
Problems piling one on
top of the other

1892
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,080
What happened?

1893
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,120
So scared what will happen next!

1894
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,720
What is bothering you?

1895
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,680
Can you explain in a way
that I can understand?

1896
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,280
I must tell you
something very important

1897
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,520
Anjali, who is it?

1898
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,680
Why didn't you tell me
your sister is here with you?

1899
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,440
I've spoken to you abou-

1900
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,720
I know him very well

1901
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,640
How?

1902
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,560
He is the scumbag
who stopped my wedding

1903
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,360
He lied saying I was
in love with some chap

1904
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,640
No way
Can't be Arjun

1905
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:29,920
You won't believe me?

1906
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,240
Please, 1 minute

1907
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,200
Anjali I've been wanting
to tell you this

1908
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,360
I stopped it, not knowing
it is your sister's wedding

1909
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:36,880
I swear
It wasn't our fault

1910
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,560
Anjali, wait

1911
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,120
What are you doing?

1912
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,280
Look at me

1913
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,840
Listen to me

1914
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,880
Your anger is justified

1915
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:51,760
Thrash me, yell at me

1916
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:52,960
Even hit me with your slipper

1917
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,000
Anjali, listen to me

1918
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,160
No need, Arjun

1919
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:57,920
What else did you intend
lying to me about?

1920
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,080
My intention is never
to lie or deceive you

1921
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,000
Please understand

1922
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,000
I hid this information from you
and that was wrong on my part

1923
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:03,840
I accept

1924
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:06,040
You made my entire family cry

1925
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,160
It wasn't intentional

1926
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,280
You'll even say it wasn't wrong?

1927
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,640
I came home that day only to
apologize to your whole family

1928
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:16,000
Without making proper enquiries
stopping Darshini's wedding was wrong

1929
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:18,760
We came to explain that
it was Srinivas's scheming idea

1930
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,480
Only after I came there
we knew you belong to that family

1931
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,080
Don't give me excuses

1932
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,520
You had so many chances
to tell me if you had wanted to

1933
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,800
Understand this,
I tried my bes-

1934
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:27,600
Simple, Arjun

1935
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:30,960
You can be Mr Goody-goody
after this but I can't accept you

1936
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,120
You can't possibly trouble me
more than this, enough!

1937
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,520
Let me go

1938
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,720
Anjali, listen to me

1939
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:38,560
It's over between us

1940
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,200
Anjali, wait

1941
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,360
Confidentiality is
of utmost priority

1942
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,640
He's my partner
but he has a mistress

1943
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,360
You must tell his wife

1944
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,080
You mean well
So we'll do this, sir

1945
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:07,440
If he means well
why doesn't he tell?

1946
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,320
Why are you here
if I'm breaking the news?

1947
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,640
You need money
I need my job done

1948
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,560
Don't think we'll sell
our souls for money

1949
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:18,400
We can't split a family
for your benefit

1950
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,080
Arjun...!

1951
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:29,400
What's wrong with you?
Why are you getting tensed?

1952
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:30,240
Solid payment

1953
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:31,200
So what?

1954
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,640
Rs 100000!
We need the money now

1955
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:35,440
If he's offering us this kind of money
wonder what evidence he has!

1956
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,840
It doesn't seem right to me

1957
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:39,360
What, dude?

1958
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:42,800
Hello! If you can, say yes
Otherwise say you can't

1959
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,480
You're walking off
like some big shot

1960
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,120
You'll get it from me
if you let your tongue run

1961
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:46,960
Keep quiet

1962
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,080
How dare you talk
to me like this!

1963
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,240
You leave now

1964
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,440
I'll deal with you later

1965
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:56,360
Clear off

1966
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,600
Why did you hit him?

1967
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,440
He can go to hell
Let's go, I'll handle it

1968
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,880
We could have easily
earned Rs 100000

1969
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,000
Why are you obsessed
with money all the time?

1970
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,280
Who will pay my bills?

1971
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,280
Your dad-

1972
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,640
You keep harping about money
It has robbed us of our peace of mind

1973
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:12,160
Do you know
what a mess we are in?

1974
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:13,960
I told you right then
we'll confess to Anjali

1975
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,040
You kept saying no

1976
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,120
How does that matter now?

1977
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:17,240
She knows everything

1978
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,520
We've split now

1979
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,240
I was against this business
right then, but you insisted

1980
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,080
You agreed and that's why
you got into it full-fledged

1981
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:24,480
I didn't have a job then

1982
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,280
I lost my job because of you

1983
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,160
Yes, I am to blame
for everything

1984
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,280
You are flawless

1985
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:31,840
Stop blaming others

1986
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:34,280
Now I realize why your grandpa
chucked you out of his house

1987
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:55,440
"If your friend walks out on you
why don't you rebuild your bond true?"

1988
01:40:55,520 --> 01:41:02,800
"If your pillar of support breaks
why don't you mend your mistakes?"

1989
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:10,120
"Is love just a mirage?
A song lost in the breeze?"

1990
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:18,920
"Is solitude the only reality then?
Is your shadow your companion?"

1991
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:37,440
- How much?
- Rs 400

1992
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,080
Look at this wonder!

1993
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,760
He received us at the airport

1994
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,400
Without us telling him
he is taking our luggage in

1995
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,800
It's most surprising

1996
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,320
I also feel the same

1997
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:57,200
Maybe he'll turn back
and say 'April fool'!

1998
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:58,960
But this isn't April!

1999
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,360
You can't sleep
if you don't find fault with him

2000
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:05,120
Why would I,
if he was like all other kids?

2001
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,680
Do you think he's in love?

2002
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:12,280
You said you saw a girl with him
when you spoke to him on Skype?

2003
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,320
May be that girl?

2004
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:15,600
May be?

2005
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:18,360
"Something is happening"

2006
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:22,520
After travelling 24 hours
my ears are blocked

2007
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,640
If you sing, something drastic
might happen to me!

2008
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:26,640
Hit...hit...hit you

2009
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:31,400
Hi gramps

2010
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,440
Kavitha has sent you these

2011
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,840
Check if the size is okay

2012
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,080
I'll see later please

2013
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,680
Trip was real fun

2014
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:39,840
We went to the Niagara

2015
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,320
What a waterfall!

2016
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,920
Then we went to Las Vegas
with all the slot machines

2017
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,360
We went and saw
the Grand Canyon

2018
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:52,600
Next time we should go again
if by God's grace you get a visa

2019
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,480
We can go

2020
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,760
Why are you out of sorts?

2021
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,000
Nothing, I'm fine

2022
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,680
My sweat pea!
Look at this

2023
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:01,480
Hi glam-ma

2024
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,600
Kavitha sent you a big phone

2025
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,720
She called it Tablet
or some such thing

2026
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,360
She bought it
specially for you

2027
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:09,120
You aren't even looking at it

2028
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,880
Want me to see?
It's lovely, glam-ma

2029
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,400
What's wrong?

2030
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,960
Nothing, why?

2031
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:19,720
Nothing is wrong, grandpa

2032
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:25,840
I'll collect the rent
from our tenant in Porur

2033
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:29,120
You don't have to
He has paid it online

2034
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:32,120
Looks like 'sir' has suddenly
become responsible

2035
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,480
What's your problem?

2036
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,440
If I am irresponsible
you yell at me

2037
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:37,520
If I'm responsible
you take a dig at me

2038
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,600
Yes, I'm irresponsible

2039
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,160
If I am myself...

2040
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,400
...I make everyone's life miserable

2041
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,440
I'll live all by myself
till the very end

2042
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,720
You were right
I'm a failure

2043
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,000
Good for nothing

2044
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:55,680
Thanks a ton
I am leaving

2045
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,680
Where are you going?

2046
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,000
What does it matter
where I go?

2047
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,200
You left me and went, right?

2048
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,640
It was all for your own good

2049
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:05,000
You abandoned me
like an orphan...?

2050
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,600
If something had
happened to me

2051
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:08,280
If I had gone once and for all?

2052
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:09,440
Stop it...stop

2053
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,080
What temerity?
You blockhead!

2054
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,240
How can he talk like this?

2055
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:14,440
How dare you say such things?

2056
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,760
I didn't think of you
half as much as he did

2057
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,680
He was thinking of you
the whole time

2058
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:21,640
He kept calling your useless friends
and enquiring if you were alright

2059
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,240
Apologize to him

2060
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,200
I'll kill you, rascal

2061
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,160
Let him be

2062
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:26,880
Let go of him

2063
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,120
Take a shower and come

2064
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,800
Is this the way
to talk to elders?

2065
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:42,560
What are you doing here?

2066
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,960
I need to talk to you

2067
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,040
Don't, Karna

2068
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,160
Arjun-Anjali relationship
is in a mess as it is

2069
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:48,400
That's different

2070
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,120
I want to tell you
something important

2071
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,760
I don't want to
listen to anything

2072
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:56,840
Why are you following me?

2073
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,200
I have to talk to you

2074
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,800
- Any problem?
- Nothing, bro

2075
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,040
Sir...sir, get in

2076
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,080
I want to ask you something

2077
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:18,320
If you can treat me only as a friend
we can talk or go out together

2078
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,720
Otherwise it is best we don't
talk to each other for a while

2079
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,800
Your boyfriend is not
what you think him to be

2080
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,320
I love a girl called Keerthi

2081
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,200
You should tell her somehow
that we won't get along-

2082
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,160
Don't do this, Karna

2083
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:29,080
I thought you were a good friend

2084
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:31,720
Because I rejected you
are you maligning him?

2085
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:32,960
Don't be so cheap

2086
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,320
His name is Gurumurthy

2087
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:35,680
He works in your office

2088
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,040
But hasn't attended office
for the past 3 days

2089
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:40,440
Oh! She stays in Thiruvanmaiyur

2090
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:41,720
How do you know?

2091
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,040
I've heard about her

2092
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,040
How?

2093
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,320
We have delivered news
for her twice or thrice earlier

2094
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,000
You mean, saying she loves
someone else-

2095
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:52,720
I had a narrow escape

2096
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,320
How many years
have you been going steady?

2097
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,600
2 years

2098
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,080
She has had a narrower escape!

2099
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:13,280
Don't talk without knowing-

2100
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:14,720
I know what I'm saying

2101
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,040
You've loved a girl for 2 years

2102
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,880
I tarnish her reputation
and you believe me!

2103
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:18,800
Aren't you ashamed?

2104
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:20,280
Do you know what love is?

2105
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,160
I know her for a short while

2106
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:24,400
I was so intent on professing
my love to her and she said...

2107
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:25,880
...'I love someone' and
rejected me outright

2108
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,240
You're trying to ditch
such a lovely girl

2109
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:28,720
I understood
what you said in Tamil

2110
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,080
Don't show off your English!

2111
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:31,640
Get lost!

2112
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:36,840
He could have told me

2113
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:39,920
He asked you to
be the messenger?

2114
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:44,680
Not professionally
Because you're my friend

2115
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,840
I'm in the kitchen
Come here

2116
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:57,400
Coming, gramps

2117
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:02,120
What?

2118
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06,400
Heard you love whiskey

2119
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:07,600
Karna told me

2120
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:14,960
Went through hell buying this
without your grandma sniffing!

2121
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:21,160
Don't want, gramps

2122
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,760
Oscar winning performance!

2123
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:25,360
No soda
No ice

2124
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:30,160
No need, gramps
I'll drink it neat

2125
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,840
It saves time

2126
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,800
Your wish, sir

2127
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:37,120
What about you?

2128
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:38,840
That's all in my glorious past

2129
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:41,560
After your parents left us
I stopped all this

2130
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,680
Eat this

2131
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,040
Can I get pickle?

2132
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:08,360
I believe you're into
some business

2133
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,120
Why aren't you talking about it?

2134
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,800
I don't want to continue
It's creating so many problems

2135
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:16,840
Problems are how we perceive it

2136
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:22,200
Don't we have problems
in friendship, love or business?

2137
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:24,600
Gramps, no need

2138
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,200
You have to go to this college
Take up this course

2139
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:30,680
Work in this office
Buy this vehicle

2140
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:33,600
Have we ever forced you
to do any of this?

2141
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:34,640
Tell me

2142
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:38,320
Grandma and I just want you
to be responsible, that's all

2143
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:41,160
That's why I started
a business and tried my best

2144
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:44,560
Krishnan, I can smell
something burning

2145
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,560
Lower the flame
What is today's menu?

2146
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,640
Her problem is food

2147
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:56,360
Have you fought with Karna?

2148
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:57,520
He told you that too?

2149
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,440
He needn't tell me

2150
01:48:58,480 --> 01:48:59,800
It's written all over your face

2151
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,520
He's a good chap

2152
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:04,520
He cares for you
even more than we do

2153
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,760
Go and see him now, talk
through the night and patch it up

2154
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,240
Come back in the morning

2155
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:12,840
Cops keep checking
on the way nowadays

2156
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,080
Be careful when you leave

2157
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,600
Your grandma is a sniffer dog

2158
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:23,360
Come back safe and sound

2159
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:25,160
Gramps...?

2160
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,680
You rock, dude

2161
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:32,520
All for this, right?

2162
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,640
Don't show off
your Oscar performance to me!

2163
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:37,840
Oh gawd!

2164
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,960
I have to tell you something

2165
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,680
When you are angry
you look awesome!

2166
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:50,680
Shall I sing a song for you?

2167
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,720
- No, please
- Why?

2168
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,120
When you sing
you look awful

2169
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:55,240
Give you 2 tight slaps!

2170
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:57,560
I'll go see Karna
and be back

2171
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,560
Come back soon, my dear

2172
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:01,600
That's all

2173
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:16,360
What's this new habit?
Drinking by yourself?

2174
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,640
What's your new habit
of getting angry?

2175
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:20,160
If I don't talk
you won't call, huh?

2176
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:21,640
Why shouldn't I come
to your house?

2177
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:22,760
I never said any such thing

2178
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,720
When I walked out of
your house, you left it at that

2179
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:26,080
You could have
called me back, right?

2180
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:26,840
1 minute

2181
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,360
Did you stay with me
because I called you?

2182
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:29,040
No

2183
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,080
Or did I ask you to get out?

2184
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,440
Then why did you-
Don't make me swear

2185
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:39,520
Why are you here?

2186
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:42,360
Power went off while I was watching
'Nothing but the whole truth'

2187
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:43,480
So I came up here

2188
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,200
We fought stupidly like how
they show in that program, right?

2189
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:50,600
If 2 friends fight
they'll surely get back

2190
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:54,720
Because they lack anger,
false pride, prestige, dignity etc

2191
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:01,600
If you intend delivering punch dialogs
kindly do so by warning me ahead

2192
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:05,280
If you intend coming home
kindly warn me before you land up

2193
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:07,760
I'll at least lock my house
and catch a late night film

2194
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:14,320
Let's wind up this business
and get a decent job

2195
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:16,120
We also need to
settle down in life properly

2196
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,040
Think about it

2197
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:20,240
At least for 1 whole year
we must stick to the same office

2198
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,920
Can you ever do that?

2199
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:23,240
How can you say this?

2200
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,640
I've been through hell
these few weeks

2201
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:27,080
Enough is enough

2202
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:30,000
We have to straighten up
certain issues, dude

2203
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,000
This junk of a hulk gets married

2204
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,080
Only he's lucky!

2205
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:40,760
We are stopping the wedding

2206
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:41,840
Wait...wait

2207
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:46,880
Just because a dog bites us
will we bite the dog back?

2208
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:47,680
No

2209
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:54,920
Just because he ruined a girl's life
you intend doing the same

2210
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,680
How fair is this?

2211
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,360
Greetings

2212
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:01,560
A small request
for society's sake

2213
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:03,000
Meet me in my office

2214
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,360
This is kind of personal

2215
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:05,080
Okay, tell me

2216
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:07,520
I'll come straight to the point

2217
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:10,520
She is the girl who loves
your son-in-law-to be

2218
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:15,160
He unjustly blamed the girl
he was engaged to be married

2219
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,520
And he stopped that wedding

2220
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:17,520
What are you saying?

2221
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:19,520
I know you won't believe this

2222
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:23,280
But from Facebook messages
to flight tickets, we have proof

2223
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:24,560
Who are you?

2224
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,040
- Is this really true?
- Yes sir

2225
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:28,240
Uncle, don't believe whatever
they told you, all lies

2226
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,000
How do you know
what they told me?

2227
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,680
They are lying, uncle

2228
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,880
I'll ensure you are-

2229
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,080
You'll do what?

2230
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:37,920
He is the selfie maniac!

2231
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,080
Wonder how many girls
he has taken for a ride?

2232
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:42,800
What's the matter, in-law?

2233
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:45,160
Your son has loved
and dated this girl

2234
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:49,080
Instead of having the guts to tell you
he has lied and stopped the wedding

2235
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:50,840
My son would have
never behaved like that

2236
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,160
Who?
This boy?

2237
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,600
Now do you believe us?

2238
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:57,760
I trusted you so much

2239
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,600
Instead of coming to blows
he's bowling!

2240
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:01,160
Let's see what has to be done

2241
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,800
Forgive me

2242
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,360
What's your name, dear?

2243
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,280
I apologize on his behalf

2244
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,480
Bring your parents

2245
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,360
We can discuss and
fix the wedding date

2246
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:13,200
Ask your son to be true
to at least one girl

2247
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:14,600
He's a born liar

2248
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:18,000
Even if he begs my forgiveness
and wants to marry me...

2249
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:19,320
...I don't intend accepting him

2250
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,520
True, this is how
an ideal girl should think

2251
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,040
Because of us
this wedding was stopped

2252
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:29,920
If I'm worried about today's disgrace
tomorrow she'll come back distressed

2253
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,120
Whatever happened
is only for the good

2254
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,640
Can you do us a favour, sir?

2255
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,520
- Good evening
- Who are you?

2256
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:38,840
I am Arul Mani

2257
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:43,720
Arjun and Karna
Bring that scumbag here

2258
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,400
He's the culprit

2259
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:47,880
How did he have
a change of heart?

2260
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,200
As if he'll change
We made him change!

2261
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,520
Slightly

2262
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:05,360
Darshini, these boys told me all that
happened regarding your wedding

2263
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:09,080
The fault lies fully with Srinivas

2264
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:11,240
If they hadn't told us...

2265
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:13,640
...we would've all
been taken for a ride

2266
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:17,120
When they have
saved my daughter's life...

2267
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:21,440
...they wouldn't have ruined
another girl's life intentionally

2268
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:23,840
Sorry, Darshini
I'm to blame, I agree

2269
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:26,800
First ask him to leave

2270
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:31,240
You both are like
my own daughters

2271
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:33,640
You can knock at my door
any time you want

2272
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:34,920
Let me take leave, dear

2273
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:40,520
Dear boys,
Arjun and Karna

2274
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,720
I'm proud of you

2275
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,680
Other than Keerthi
you're like my sisters

2276
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:01,920
Whatever help you need
you can trust this brother!

2277
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:03,800
Did you call me?

2278
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:04,520
Get lost!

2279
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,040
Hey Arjun
Where did you go?

2280
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,120
Problem...problem

2281
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,680
Drink some water

2282
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,200
Eat some 'pongal'

2283
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,240
Salt is less

2284
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:26,040
'Sambar' is slightly salty
It will get balanced

2285
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:29,560
Yuck!
Too much salt

2286
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:32,280
What's your program
for this evening?

2287
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:33,640
I intend meeting Anjali

2288
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:35,000
But she won't be here

2289
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,320
That's what I wanted to tell you

2290
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:37,520
Anjali is leaving this place

2291
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:38,440
She must be coming back

2292
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:40,360
It seemed like she was
leaving permanently

2293
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,920
She was carrying
couple of heavy bags

2294
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:43,400
Why the hell didn't you
tell me this first?

2295
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,680
I had 'pongal' in my mouth!

2296
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,440
Arjun, wait
I'm also coming

2297
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:52,600
Hurry up

2298
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:53,880
How does this
concern you?

2299
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:56,360
Only if you and Anjali get married
Keerthi and I can have a baby happi-

2300
01:55:56,440 --> 01:55:58,120
Shut your gob
and get an auto

2301
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:01,520
Bro, coming

2302
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:02,560
No, I can't come

2303
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:03,880
Bro, please understand

2304
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:07,480
We won't haggle with you to put
the meter, bargain or make you wait

2305
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,160
Please come

2306
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:09,280
Come...come

2307
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:11,520
Sit, man

2308
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,560
Boys, is your girlfriend
catching a flight?

2309
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:23,920
Yes, bro
How do you know?

2310
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:25,240
What's the time now?

2311
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:28,040
Not late enough to worry about
the wine shop closing down

2312
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,400
What else will youngsters
be hassled about?

2313
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:31,280
Only love

2314
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:33,920
You speak very smartly
Drive equally smart

2315
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:35,600
Where is Anjali?

2316
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:38,200
Only I know the pain of
your girlfriend leaving you

2317
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,480
I understood that
only when Keerthi left me

2318
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:41,760
Who asked you
to come with me?

2319
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:43,680
A friend in need
is a friend indeed, dude

2320
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:44,840
Wait, man

2321
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,960
That's the cab Anjali is in

2322
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:51,440
Bro, follow that cab

2323
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:52,280
No problem, sonny

2324
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,760
We can catch up
with her at the signal

2325
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:03,680
Sonny, money?

2326
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:04,960
Is credit card okay?

2327
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,400
Ma, we are on the way to the airport

2328
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,400
Did you pack everything?

2329
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:08,880
Check in and then cal-

2330
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:09,840
Arjun...?

2331
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:12,480
My wallet is in another shirt, bro

2332
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:14,800
What did you tell me
when you got into the auto?

2333
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,840
We won't haggle with you
to put the meter

2334
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:17,360
Then?

2335
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,600
We won't bargain

2336
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:19,120
Then?

2337
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,000
He has money
Let's go

2338
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:22,880
I'll call you later

2339
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:25,800
Where are you going?

2340
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:26,480
On-site?

2341
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,520
Why are you here?

2342
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:29,240
I need to talk
to you urgently

2343
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:30,200
Come out, please

2344
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,240
Very important

2345
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,640
- Whatever it is, we'll discuss later
- Get down, please

2346
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,280
What happened?

2347
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:37,720
Where are you going?

2348
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:38,400
Singapore

2349
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:40,120
Don't decide anything

2350
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:40,920
Listen to me

2351
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:42,680
Stay here
Don't go

2352
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:45,840
Is this something we can talk
in the middle of the road?

2353
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,240
I'm late
Let me go

2354
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,000
Please don't go, Anjali

2355
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:50,800
I couldn't think of
any other way to stop you

2356
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,240
Talk later
Middle of the road

2357
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:53,880
You'll be beaten
black and blue

2358
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:55,960
Why did you say, 'a friend in
need is a friend indeed' then

2359
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,160
Go and do something

2360
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,680
Do I look like a madcap?

2361
01:57:58,760 --> 01:57:59,800
Madcap

2362
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:01,520
I can't get hit for your sake

2363
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:03,120
All that friend indeed
is cancelled

2364
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,000
Pay him

2365
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:04,520
Pay

2366
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:05,640
Give me cash

2367
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:08,200
Hey! You utter another word
your 32 teeth will be missing

2368
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,080
I'm talking to you and
where are you staring?

2369
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:13,920
The cab took off

2370
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:15,080
Whaat?

2371
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:16,600
That auto guy was pestering us

2372
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:18,800
Anjali and her sis
were in the cab

2373
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:20,640
Before we could
catch the cab, it took off

2374
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:21,400
In that gap-

2375
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,080
Attendant of room # 214
come immediately

2376
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:23,920
What's the matter?

2377
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:26,200
Room 214 attendant
come immediately

2378
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:27,200
Oh my gawd!

2379
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:29,360
Be a little patient

2380
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:31,320
I've informed the doctor
She will be here anytime now

2381
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,640
I've called your attendant also

2382
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:33,720
I'm here...coming

2383
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:35,160
Calm down

2384
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:37,440
Doctor will be here anytime

2385
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:43,320
Look! Director Bhagyaraj sir
is here to see you

2386
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:46,480
- Sir, I'm your biggest fan
- Watch it, careful

2387
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,960
Suddenly the baby will slip out
There isn't any nurse or doctor here

2388
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,160
Oh! Big fan, sir

2389
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:52,880
Breathe...breathe

2390
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:54,200
You're doing a great job

2391
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,040
My hand...hand

2392
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:59,480
Keep saying 'all is well'

2393
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,720
Call the doctor first

2394
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,120
It will take 30 minutes
for the doctor to come

2395
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:05,120
30 minutes?

2396
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,440
30 minutes, huh?

2397
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:14,080
How are you, Karna?

2398
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:17,360
I've heard a lot
about you from Arjun

2399
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:19,440
I've painted you a saint, dude

2400
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:21,680
Breathe...breathe

2401
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:27,480
Anjali, this is normal
for all women

2402
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:29,000
It will stop in a while

2403
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,000
Just be brave

2404
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,160
No, sir

2405
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:31,960
No, my dear

2406
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,120
Even if your darling husband
is right next to you...

2407
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:36,600
...not having your own parents
with you because they are angry

2408
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,000
...will make you feel
the pain all the more

2409
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:40,200
As soon as the baby is born
tomorrow all this pain will vanish

2410
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,560
Sir, you've got it wrong

2411
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:42,800
Don't talk of right and wrong

2412
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:44,680
I'm so much older than you
and you're still a youngster

2413
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,600
These are life's lessons

2414
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:48,040
This is why you shouldn't become
a husband when you're so young

2415
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:50,000
Gawd! Please wake up my husband

2416
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:50,960
Another husband?

2417
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,000
No, sir, she is Karna's husband

2418
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:55,280
Shucks! He is my husband Karna

2419
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:03,000
What happened to Arjun-Anjali?

2420
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,000
Whaaat?

2421
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:06,360
Oho! This is break up
And then he picked up, huh?

2422
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:12,480
You're the first lover who supervised
the delivery of your ex-love!

2423
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:17,520
What a twist! This sentiment will
work out very well with our audience

2424
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:19,280
I'm not Anjali
I'm Keerthi

2425
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:20,800
He's my husband

2426
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,120
He fainted

2427
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:25,200
Next week Arjun and Anjali
are getting married

2428
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:27,080
My parents have gone to Tirupati

2429
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:28,680
Do you have any other doubt?

2430
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:30,560
Can I deliver my baby now?

2431
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,560
Your baby should've
been born by now

2432
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:35,760
Why are you all crowding
round the patient?

2433
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:37,960
Step outside
Chief doctor will come now

2434
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:41,040
May you be blessed, Anjali

2435
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:42,160
Keerthiiii!

2436
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,520
Sir...sir

2437
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:49,400
Is it a boy or a girl?

2438
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:51,800
Just want a selfie with you

2439
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:53,320
For Facebook, huh?

2440
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:54,760
Yes, sir

2441
02:00:58,280 --> 02:01:01,240
Such a chweetiepie

2442
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:09,400
Basically in our family-
