1
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:01,551
He is committing thefts in 22 districts..

2
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:04,486
..and giving sleepless nights to people. Who is this thief?

3
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,092
Sampoornesh Babu.

4
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,298
Who is he? Is he a cruel devil?

5
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,487
Brother is God.

6
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:10,995
Doesn't he have humanity?

7
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:14,012
He is giving trouble to police. He is stealing public wealth.

8
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:15,203
Stealing?

9
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:21,049
If you move an article from one place to another place, so will you call it stealing.

10
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,825
He is fooling the media! When will he get caught?

11
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:26,783
When will he be seen? Who will catch him? In fact how does he look?

12
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:28,580
He looks like a brother.

13
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,030
You should ask a person about his weight and height

14
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:34,935
but you should ask brother for his guts.

15
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,150
You need to have heart to see brother, not eyes.

16
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:41,320
The buttons on your shirt should become hearts

17
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:43,646
if you wish to see brother directly into his eyes.

18
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:45,891
Hail! Hail! Sampoo!

19
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:48,747
Hail! Hail! Sampoo!

20
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:32,629
No!

21
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:33,570
What happened?

22
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:40,910
This lock is made in Thailand. Only God and the manufacturer can open it.

23
00:05:41,203 --> 00:05:42,472
Cannot we do anything?

24
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,595
We cannot do. I am the key specialist in the city.

25
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,034
It is not possible for me to open it so..

26
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:50,998
..even if you get that thought then your two seconds are wasted.

27
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,134
How did you do it, brother?

28
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:52,110
Lock must be made in Thailand but this brain belongs to Indian.

29
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:57,557
The thief who is committing serials thefts will be caught soon..

30
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,125
..and henceforth no theft will happen again. Prime Minster of India has said it.

31
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,064
"Who? Who? Who is he?"

32
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:28,968
"Who? Our man has come in front of us?"

33
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:44,302
"I am Sampoo. Nickname is stubborn."

34
00:07:44,753 --> 00:07:51,392
"I am Sampoo. Nickname is stubborn."

35
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,732
"Are you waiting with thousand eyes for me?"

36
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,232
"Are you searching for him everywhere? He is your Sampoo."

37
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:03,671
"Sampoo! Sampoo! Sampoornesh Babu."

38
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:07,222
"Your Sampoornesh Babu."

39
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:15,572
"Sampoornesh Babu! "Your Sampoornesh Babu."

40
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:43,657
"Hey! Hey! Hey!"

41
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,420
Chiranjeevis are gone, Balayyas are past."

42
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:54,680
"Brother Sampoo is the latest tsunami."

43
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,496
"Whoever is the hero, his days are finished."

44
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:00,962
"I will apply shampoo to him."

45
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:05,691
"Biceps of Nagarjuna, Triceps of Venkatesh.."

46
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,160
''Brother is the flood that will wash out everything."

47
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,857
"He will trash if you cross paths with him."

48
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:16,229
"I will give him a feast."

49
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:18,830
"Wow! What is your name, brother-in-law?"

50
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,382
"Sampoo! Sampoo! Sampoornesh Babu."

51
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:26,886
"Your Sampoornesh Babu."

52
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,464
"Sampoornesh Babu."

53
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:35,528
"Your Sampoornesh Babu."

54
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:14,106
"Power star's power, super star's star.."

55
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:17,657
"He is the volcano that sets ablaze everything."

56
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:21,209
"Sharat Babu's softness, Tarakrama Rao's fierce.."

57
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:24,309
"Ready to rock anywhere, anywhere."

58
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,233
"This heroism is for you all."

59
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,739
"Who are you, sir?"

60
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:34,296
"Sampoo! Sampoo! Sampoornesh Babu."

61
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:37,949
"Your Sampoornesh Babu."

62
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:45,772
"Sampoornesh Babu. Your Sampoornesh Babu."

63
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:18,023
Hey, thief! All these days I thought you are a good person.

64
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:23,122
So it is you who is doing all these.

65
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:25,695
How many thefts will you commit?

66
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:31,292
How many will you steal? If you do like this then one day you will get caught by someone.

67
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:32,922
You will get married instantly.

68
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:35,350
Shwasa, listen to me. What happened was..

69
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,754
Yes.. yes.. I know.

70
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:39,074
Do you think I didn't see Paddu..

71
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:43,498
..living in front had seen you in the morning?

72
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,001
How many girls’ hearts will you steal like this?

73
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:48,692
How many more hearts will you steal?

74
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:50,779
Oh! Is it?

75
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,010
I felt tension by thinking of something else.

76
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:54,516
What did you think?

77
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:56,718
No need. You will not tolerate if I tell you.

78
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:58,856
Oh! Yes.. yes..

79
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,674
Every stupid girl ogles at you..

80
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:04,913
But you don't care for Shwasa though we live in the same house.

81
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:07,170
Look, Shwasa. You are a very small girl.

82
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,261
Small girl?

83
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:10,983
Sleep with this small pillow.

84
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:13,945
I will show whether I am a small girl or not.

85
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:15,800
Ugh! Don't know who marries you but..

86
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:17,227
Who else?

87
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,443
You have to marry me.

88
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:22,889
What a smile!

89
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:28,749
My God! You are not in politics. Otherwise girls will vote for you in large numbers.

90
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:32,485
Does anyone have the power to stop from entering politics when the right time comes?

91
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:36,011
At present I am concentrating on my work to succeed.

92
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:40,450
That's it. I want everyone's blessings for it. Did you understand, Shwasa?

93
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:42,217
Yes, I understood.

94
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,988
See if someone might concentrate on you..

95
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,334
Blessings later. Bye.

96
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:57,145
Concentration on me?

97
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:07,038
After watching a person at movie theatre, we ask, have you come for movie?

98
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:09,760
After watching a friend paying bill at hotel, we ask, did you eat?

99
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:13,225
Likewise we begin talking rubbish by saying why we gathered in this kind of conference.

100
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:15,769
Nothing will work if you talk rubbish like that.

101
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,936
Whoever he is, he is playing with us.

102
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:19,605
We have seen many thieves in life.

103
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,376
We played with many criminals.

104
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:24,836
But I had never seen anyone who troubled us like this.

105
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,153
Media is bashing us!

106
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,901
Senior officers are shouting at us!

107
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,772
Time has come to risk our jobs!

108
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:32,941
We need an officer who can give hope to our miserable lives.

109
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:36,324
Central government asked me what kind of officer you want.

110
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,893
There was only one person in my mind.

111
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:42,186
A killing took place in a marriage when I was studying 8th class.

112
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:43,781
There were 500 people that day

113
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:46,594
and police became mad as they couldn't understand who carried out it.

114
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,552
And then one officer came there.

115
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:51,273
He smelled the knife that was used to slit the killer's throat.

116
00:13:51,478 --> 00:13:53,449
He asked whether anyone has come from Nellore.

117
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:55,387
Six people came forward.

118
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:59,207
He smelled the hands of those six people for half minute and then caught the killer.

119
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,794
He smelled the scent rubbed to the knife and said he hailed nearby to Tamil Nadu..

120
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:06,657
He caught the thief in half minute by finding who that Telugu person is.

121
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,896
I cannot forget that day in my life.

122
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:11,510
I gave up my wish to become a doctor and..

123
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:15,139
..studies IAS and became SI in his area.

124
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:45,761
Has everyone attended the meeting? - Yes, sir.

125
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,839
Are you sure? - Yes, sir.

126
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,673
Why Sanath Nagar SI and Malakpet’s CI didn’t didn't come?

127
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:52,396
How do you know, sir?

128
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:55,718
Don't play games with me. I know all the things behind me.

129
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:59,688
My eyes, ears and nose work like eagle when I speak with my mouth.

130
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:02,388
There should be 16 shoes belonging to eight persons who attend the meeting.

131
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,855
But only 12 are there.

132
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,646
I saw SI's jeep on the way..

133
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,325
..and I threw a stone at Malakpet CI who comes late often.

134
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:12,259
If I were not to find out your lies..

135
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:15,490
..then either I should be sleeping or I should lose this badge.

136
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:17,534
Bhairav! Bhairav Rathod!

137
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:20,266
If you yawn then I will feed your intestines.

138
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:35,023
22 districts, 222 thefts..

139
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:37,499
2222 policemen..

140
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,519
Forget finger prints, you cannot even find foot prints.

141
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:42,955
Shame on you guys!

142
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:48,195
Sir, thieves have applies nail polish to palms so we couldn't find finger prints.

143
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:49,508
Find foot prints.

144
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,076
You know there are foot prints too like finger prints.

145
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:55,184
Think well.

146
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,845
If belongings are not there then it means they are lost.

147
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:01,012
If they were not lost then they would have been there.

148
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:04,912
If the shop owners have taken them away then they should know it.

149
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:08,282
It means articles are lost because of stealing.

150
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:13,124
So what did we understand with it? It is definitely the work of thieves.

151
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,719
So why these thefts are taking place at nights?

152
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:19,898
These thieves are not ordinary people.

153
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:24,470
We will find out if they commit thefts during day so they are committing in the night.

154
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,340
So how did they take them?

155
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,731
Since the stolen articles are heavy so they must have definitely used some vehicle.

156
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:34,176
Look for tyre marks at the place of burglary.

157
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:35,824
Search the entire city.

158
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,063
Send every vehicle's tyre to DNA report.

159
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:39,904
Throw every suspect in jail.

160
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:41,742
Whether it is CM or American President..

161
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,147
..don't release anyone without Bhairav's permission.

162
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:44,983
Yes, sir!

163
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:47,166
Every criminal commits thefts very intelligently.

164
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,712
But he is committing thefts easily.

165
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,733
If he is concentrating carefully and committing thefts then..

166
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,721
..nobody can stop him.

167
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:56,836
Go! Catch him immediately!

168
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:09,053
Hey! Your boy friend is there.

169
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,879
Wow! How handsome he is! Salman Khan wearing shirt!

170
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:27,571
Look at his style. He seems to train Rajinikanth.

171
00:17:30,743 --> 00:17:32,284
Ugh! Stop it!

172
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,487
He is mine.

173
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,253
The queue behind him is as big as the one that waits for Pawan Kalyan's movie on first day.

174
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,913
And then you will be behind me and I will be in front of her.

175
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:44,250
Ugh! Ugh! It is my foolishness to walk with you.

176
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,978
Excuse me. Will you please drop me?

177
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,135
Hey! Why did you stop like that?

178
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,243
Sorry! Sorry! I just said for fun.

179
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,656
Fun?

180
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,921
I thought the two seconds that you asked for life were God's gift.

181
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:02,772
Don't change your words and sit on my bike.

182
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:04,518
You are talking more.

183
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:06,358
Oh! Who is this girl?

184
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:09,571
This girl's shadow. Earlier girls had friends with them all the time.

185
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:12,147
Similarly they are guards for big heroines like her.

186
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:15,060
You don't feel bad, dear. First this girl..

187
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:18,580
..and then one after another.. Done!

188
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:21,198
Hey, mister! You both are talking more.

189
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:22,453
Talk politely.

190
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:26,337
We know to talk in Telugu, write in hindi and try in English.

191
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,484
But what is this to talk politely.

192
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,111
Ugh! Don't you have sisters? - We have.

193
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:35,915
I am unable to answer them when they ask for sister-in-law.

194
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,126
Why don't you come?

195
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:38,602
Come! Come!

196
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,226
Hey, idiot! Leave her! - Leave her!

197
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:41,299
Leave! - Come!

198
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,265
You! - Girls are looking hot!

199
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:46,824
Come! Come! Do you think this is Telugu movie where hero enters?

200
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:49,664
Please help me!

201
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,229
Is there anybody?

202
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:56,577
Hey!

203
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,043
Who are you?

204
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:06,542
Hero!

205
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:07,804
What are your guts?

206
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,903
Do you know how guts look like?

207
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:16,142
If guts get frightened then it keeps my photo under the pillow and then sleeps.

208
00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:18,566
Who are you?

209
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:20,665
Brother to girls!

210
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,088
Handsome boy to girls!

211
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:27,259
I belong to everyone in Andhra.

212
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,288
I am out of reach for rogues like you.

213
00:19:31,397 --> 00:19:32,534
You are caught, right?

214
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,217
Brother! Brother! We will sit and talk. No need for manhandling.

215
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:47,851
Let us sit and talk, brother. Please, brother.

216
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:48,951
Brother, sit.. - Shall we sit and talk?

217
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:52,412
Please, brother. - Shall we sit and talk? - Please, brother!

218
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,426
No! No! Please, brother! I will not do it again! Please!

219
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:56,980
Will you tease girls? - Brother!

220
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,284
Ragging! - No, brother!

221
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,013
Please, brother. - Will you tease girls? Will you tease girls?

222
00:20:02,123 --> 00:20:04,387
Please, brother. I beg you! - Will you tease girls?

223
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:06,534
Sorry, brother!

224
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,121
No, brother! - Oh!

225
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:14,326
Legs, hands and weapons are for you.

226
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,057
My hair is enough for me.

227
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:19,052
To break your ventricles.

228
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:44,056
"He is dashing! His warns before finishing the person."

229
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:48,270
"He carries a million bolts power inside him."

230
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:53,335
"He can reach the bottom of the sea and search,"

231
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:57,897
He will bring the elixir which nobody can get."

232
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:02,522
"When the mountain hits him.."

233
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:06,965
"He will crush it into pieces in no time."

234
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:11,699
"He is a superficial lion that doesn't belong to any forest."

235
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:31,302
"Had he been there in Titanic movie then he would have held the ship with one hand."

236
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:38,246
"He can cure any disease without any tonic."

237
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:43,423
"He can visit every continent in seconds."

238
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:48,888
"He can go and touch the sun for fun."

239
00:21:48,968 --> 00:21:53,170
"Even wind cannot match his speed."

240
00:21:53,516 --> 00:21:58,774
"Even wind cannot match his speed."

241
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:06,429
"He can plough the entire earth with a small comb."

242
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:13,362
"He can dig canals with his nails at every place."

243
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:18,638
"He is the brother to He-man."

244
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:23,672
"He is the father of Guinness book."

245
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:28,406
"Even wind cannot match his speed."

246
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:32,939
"Even wind cannot match his speed."

247
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,314
Have you seen him anywhere?

248
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:59,666
Hey! Did you see this boy anywhere?

249
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:07,418
Hey! Stop! Hey!

250
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,342
Stop! Stop!

251
00:23:09,706 --> 00:23:11,298
Stop! Stop!

252
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,432
Tell us where he is!

253
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:40,209
Hey! You are able to tolerate because we are beating you.

254
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,358
See our brother sitting there. If he starts beating..

255
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,483
..then your life is finished.

256
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:55,848
Why do you lose your life for that kid?

257
00:23:55,928 --> 00:23:57,018
Who is kid?

258
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:59,853
Do you remember the nuisance that kid created?

259
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,682
If you don't remember then ask the person who planned your killing.

260
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:07,630
About the kid you asked and about the fear he instilled.

261
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:14,244
This Mamba has come to finish the person you admire the most.

262
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:16,082
Black Mamba!

263
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:20,809
Black Mamba is the dangerous snake in this world.

264
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,706
You will lose life in few minutes after its bite.

265
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:26,053
But if this Mamba bites it..

266
00:24:26,492 --> 00:24:29,274
..then it will die in half minute.

267
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:30,903
Don't do anything to me.

268
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,932
Please.. I will tell you.

269
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:34,488
I will tell you.

270
00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:37,838
We planned a theft at Trunk Road tomorrow.

271
00:24:38,024 --> 00:24:39,012
Where?

272
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:40,465
Venkateshwara Provisions.

273
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:44,865
Enough. Leave him.

274
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,541
Go!

275
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:53,165
Cyberabad police station?

276
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:56,175
I want to talk to Commissioner.

277
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:57,215
Tell me.

278
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:00,235
The dangerous thief for whom you are searching for long..

279
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:03,929
..has planned burglary at Sri Venkateshwar Electricals..

280
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:06,142
..tomorrow.

281
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:13,761
If possible then catch him or eat fritters like every day.

282
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:16,442
How do you know?

283
00:25:16,522 --> 00:25:19,495
Are you eating food or question bank, Commissioner?

284
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:20,689
Who are you?

285
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,651
I am not working under you to..

286
00:25:23,206 --> 00:25:25,715
..tell who I am if you ask about me.

287
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:28,194
Mamba! I am Black Mamba!

288
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:31,585
I should see his arrest in day after tomorrow's papers.

289
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:36,301
Otherwise you will see his dead body at cemetery after ten days.

290
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:39,290
If you can kill then why do you inform me?

291
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:41,447
Game Commissioner! Game!

292
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:44,907
Police on one side and Mamba on other side!

293
00:25:45,703 --> 00:25:49,003
Sandwich massage without even going to Bangkok.

294
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:53,144
Stop asking questions and start working.

295
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,199
Hey!

296
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:15,080
This theft is very important.

297
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,056
Police has become more vigilant.

298
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,937
By Baba's grace if this theft too succeeds..

299
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:23,059
..then the work for which we are going this..

300
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:25,852
..will become successful. Be careful.

301
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:27,834
Why are you like that?

302
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:31,290
Nothing, brother. A piece of wire fell in my eyes..

303
00:26:31,784 --> 00:26:32,508
Where is he?

304
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:34,952
Brother, he went out to bring car.

305
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,782
He will come in ten minutes. He will come.

306
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,163
Brother! Brother! - What happened, brother? - What happened?

307
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:41,854
You should see the wire and cut it.

308
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:44,176
Oh! It is bleeding!

309
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:46,369
Why are you here?

310
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:54,477
Shwasa, it is nothing. It is a small injury.

311
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:57,047
Even though the injury is minor, the bandage should be big, Sampoo!

312
00:26:57,342 --> 00:26:58,579
First get it tied.

313
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,051
After that..

314
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,374
Ugh!

315
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:03,600
Yes, hero? Where?

316
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:06,627
Everyone applied makeup as if they are going for marriage or burglary.

317
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:09,842
Didn't I say that I will tell you later?

318
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:45,253
Brother, it seems police has come. Siren sound!

319
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:49,070
Hey! Somebody informed the police.

320
00:27:50,158 --> 00:27:53,023
We should leave from here. It will be lead to problem if all of us take the same route.

321
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:54,408
I will go this way.

322
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:56,574
You follow me and you follow him.

323
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:57,767
Come on!

324
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:03,385
Hey! You be careful.

325
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,008
In case if I get caught.. Dhana..

326
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:08,545
You know what to do then?

327
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:12,436
I know, brother.

328
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,295
Cool! Leave from here.

329
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,011
Wash your legs so that you don't leave finger prints.

330
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:23,570
Go! - Okay, brother!

331
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,140
Brother!

332
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,679
No!

333
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,941
They escaped!

334
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,469
Somebody from us informed the police. Just now I received confirmation.

335
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,442
I never thought as friends who help me.

336
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:10,341
I thought you are my younger brothers.

337
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,001
Who betrayed us, brother?

338
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:13,558
Brother, tell me who did it!

339
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:14,927
I will kill him right now!

340
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,561
No! Let us forget this matter here.

341
00:29:18,763 --> 00:29:22,040
You are all my friends. Do you know what friends are?

342
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:24,385
Do you know what friendship is?

343
00:29:25,357 --> 00:29:27,695
If you stab a person and kill him..

344
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,474
..then our friend has hidden knife in someone's stomach.

345
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:33,419
By thinking so and believing it is called friendship.

346
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,818
Why I am telling you about the information matter because..

347
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:39,644
..even though you keep me away from you, I will remain close to you.

348
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,794
For whom I am doing and why I am doing all this..

349
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:45,085
You know it after my soul.

350
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:48,320
Even if you hit this brother on chest or kill his trust..

351
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:51,711
..I will still stand by my fans and support my brothers.

352
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,207
I am always a slave to your love.

353
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:55,815
Brother!

354
00:29:57,586 --> 00:29:58,766
Forgive me, brother!

355
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:03,385
Brother, there is no repentance for this sinner!

356
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:05,812
Forgive this traitor, brother.

357
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:08,399
Forgive me. - No! It is wrong.

358
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:10,264
What is it like kids?

359
00:30:11,463 --> 00:30:14,802
I took liberty because you are too kind.

360
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:17,796
I didn't inform the police, brother.

361
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:20,330
Do you know whom I informed? Do you know whom I informed?

362
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:21,540
Whom did you inform?

363
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,948
Mamba! - Mamba?

364
00:30:23,163 --> 00:30:25,457
Yes, brother. Mamba entered the city.

365
00:30:25,777 --> 00:30:27,036
He first caught me.

366
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:28,781
And then he caught my hair.

367
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,409
After that he held my neck.

368
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:31,990
He asked me where you are.

369
00:30:32,241 --> 00:30:34,084
Otherwise he said he will kill you.

370
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:35,387
Brother, that's why I told him,

371
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
Mamba!

372
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,984
Yes, brother. It is him.

373
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:43,215
Your life was going smoothly, he wrecked havoc in it..

374
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:45,449
He sent stranger into your life..

375
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:47,384
..and took away Mother Sita like Ravana..

376
00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:55,923
Brother, he took away mother Sita from you. Now he entered the city.

377
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:57,691
Brother, tell me what shall we do now?

378
00:30:57,771 --> 00:31:00,411
Whether he is Ravana, Kichaka, Kansa or Narakasur..

379
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:03,328
I don't know. But he didn't come searching for me.

380
00:31:03,515 --> 00:31:05,168
He came searching for his death.

381
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:07,873
Fish should live in water and birds should fly sky.

382
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:08,879
Mamba..

383
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,314
..should live in fear. I will finish him!

384
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:15,216
Kill him, brother! Kill him! He should fear seeing you in dreams..

385
00:31:15,377 --> 00:31:17,567
..and thereby he should sleep with open eyes.

386
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:19,519
Brother, he shouldn't fear to die but..

387
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:21,239
..she should fear to live.

388
00:31:21,392 --> 00:31:23,603
Brother, houseful boards should be shown in the graveyard

389
00:31:23,683 --> 00:31:25,584
when you hold a knife and start killing!

390
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:27,912
I will do it but right time should come.

391
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:31,504
He didn't try to kill me in spite of knowing my address..

392
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:33,894
..so it means he is planning something.

393
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,589
We should find out that plan.

394
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:39,209
Until then we should tolerate even if he provokes us.

395
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,480
We should bear even if he humiliates us.

396
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,356
We should lower our head if he comes across.

397
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:46,007
You should live by lifting your head but..

398
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,416
..you shouldn't live by lowering your head.

399
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:51,710
You are the brothers given to me by Bhagavan Bala Sai Baba.

400
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:55,276
Brother, where is your kerchief?

401
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:41,937
Search! He is feeling happy that he escaped.

402
00:32:42,084 --> 00:32:43,879
Search every inch at every place.

403
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:46,156
Give me a single hair of the accused.

404
00:32:46,236 --> 00:32:48,924
I will tell the brand name of the oil used for his grandfather's moustache.

405
00:32:49,196 --> 00:32:50,197
Difficult, sir.

406
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,806
Accused acted smart again.

407
00:32:53,126 --> 00:32:54,801
We kept an eye on electric shops..

408
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:57,224
..but he burgled provision shop.

409
00:32:57,585 --> 00:33:00,315
He left out costly lentils and..

410
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:04,095
..stole wires, screws, bulbs and fevicol.

411
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,616
He didn't steal money. It means he will die soon because of some disease..

412
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,683
..or he should be a scumbag who is not greed of money.

413
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:13,176
Search! Matchstick, soap, dogs..

414
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:30,614
Send this kerchief to forensic lab.

415
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:32,601
Whose kerchief is it? Whose blood it is?

416
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:35,403
The shop that sold the kerchief and the tailor who stitched it..

417
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,372
The cotton used in making this kerchief and the farmer who grew cotton..

418
00:33:38,702 --> 00:33:40,574
Everyone.. arrest everyone!

419
00:33:41,711 --> 00:33:43,990
Give Z- category security to the kerchief.

420
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:47,156
You will lose your jobs as well as die in my hands if the kerchief is lost.

421
00:34:01,077 --> 00:34:02,321
What happened, doctor?

422
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,265
He is a man who can burn even fire.

423
00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:08,460
He can make water sweat.

424
00:34:09,455 --> 00:34:12,825
Catching him is like touching death.

425
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,050
Why, doctor?

426
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,946
The age of this person who got thrashed might be between 20 and 30.

427
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:20,720
The way the kerchief got crushed..

428
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,055
Going by the power of his blood, we can say he is not an ordinary person.

429
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:27,026
He possesses the strength of four elephants.

430
00:34:27,778 --> 00:34:29,333
He possesses the pride of ten lions.

431
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,885
A person who doesn't wish to live can take on him.

432
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:33,868
By the way, what happened?

433
00:34:34,015 --> 00:34:36,095
Commissioner, you got a good clue.

434
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:39,053
I mean this kerchief carries sweat..

435
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:42,194
..perfume and grease stains.

436
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,175
This doesn't look like perfume.

437
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:55,146
It looks like scent available in old city.

438
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:58,265
By watching the kerchief's design, it looks like a ladies kerchief.

439
00:34:58,549 --> 00:34:59,998
If they are using scent too then it means..

440
00:35:00,363 --> 00:35:02,793
..it is a girl living near old city.

441
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:06,298
Or else it is the kerchief of the lover of the accused.

442
00:35:06,558 --> 00:35:10,036
She must have tied it to his hand when he injured his hand in some fight.

443
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,850
Or else there is chance that this thief could be a lady and not man.

444
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:19,652
Sir, this city has 90 lakhs population. How to find out whose kerchief it is?

445
00:35:19,956 --> 00:35:21,608
This Rathod will take care of it.

446
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,581
Go and bring census list.

447
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,482
We will meet in the office. - Yes, sir.

448
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,519
Sir..

449
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:31,406
How will you find one accused from 90 lakhs people?

450
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:35,161
Yes! Hyderabad's population is 90 lakhs.

451
00:35:35,658 --> 00:35:39,845
Out of them, women are 42,33,416.

452
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,373
Out of them, the girls between the age group of 20 to 30 lakhs..

453
00:35:42,592 --> 00:35:45,119
..are 6,93,306.

454
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,519
You brought the figure to six lakhs in half minute.

455
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:48,985
Hats off, sir!

456
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,808
So based on the statistics we have..

457
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:55,626
..there are 83,000 girls between the age group of 20 to 30. - Awesome.

458
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:58,699
Out of 83,000 girls, find out who she is.

459
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:00,247
You are wonderful, sir.

460
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:01,559
Turn on the laptop.

461
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:09,582
Yes! We got the required data.

462
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,041
Unmarried girls are 23,000.

463
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:14,572
Out of them, 10,000 girls must be attending college.

464
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:19,513
But who is the girl out of these 10,000 girls that loved him. Moreover who is he?

465
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:21,583
Go! Go and search!

466
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:32,509
Okay.. okay.. I am coming, doctor.

467
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:35,255
With whom are you talking to, Sampoo?

468
00:36:35,423 --> 00:36:36,224
It is unnecessary for you.

469
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:39,588
Unnecessary for me? Sampoo, I love you.

470
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,035
There shouldn't be secrets between you and me.

471
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:42,762
Love?

472
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,243
Why? What do I lack?

473
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:47,192
Is it romance to do by thinking of big, small, more and les?

474
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:49,840
Love! Do you know what love is, Shwasa?

475
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:53,749
Ours is a great country where there are lovers..

476
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:56,274
..who brought mother's heart when their girlfriends asked for it.

477
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:59,012
Shwasa, this is not love. It is attraction.

478
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,576
Attraction that you developed by watching my good looks.

479
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:04,725
Attraction is fulfilled when the couple sleeps in bedroom.

480
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:07,812
But love will not get fulfilled until a couple sleep in cemetery.

481
00:37:09,363 --> 00:37:10,363
Don't forget it.

482
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:15,419
Yes.. I am coming, doctor. I am coming.

483
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:17,483
Sampoo!

484
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:19,831
I am in big tension.

485
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,847
Now this is the only college left. She must be in this college at any cost.

486
00:38:39,129 --> 00:38:42,753
Search with thousand eyes like an eagle. We cannot do anything if she escapes.

487
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:43,785
Be alert!

488
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:45,319
Yes, sir. What about you?

489
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:49,686
You search with eyes. My each and every organ does the same when I am on duty.

490
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,650
You are under arrest! - Why?

491
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:17,120
What mistake did I commit? Do you have arrest warrant?

492
00:39:17,448 --> 00:39:19,548
Look, don't know whether you committed mistake or not.

493
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:21,820
But in the entire history of India..

494
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:24,015
..you are involved in one of the biggest crime case.

495
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,476
If there is such a danger because of me then..

496
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:30,029
..I will happily die even if I am hanged to death, Commissioner.

497
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:31,094
Arrest me!

498
00:39:31,294 --> 00:39:33,777
Is this yours? If it is yours then where did you throw it?

499
00:39:33,993 --> 00:39:35,727
Or else did you throw it with the boy whom you loved?

500
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:38,912
Yes! This is mine but how did it come to you.

501
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:40,925
We will talk later as how it came to me.

502
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,864
First tell me how it is missing from you.

503
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,161
I tied it to my boy friend when he got injured.

504
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:47,163
What is his name?

505
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:48,400
Don't know.

506
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,854
Place? - Don't know.

507
00:39:49,997 --> 00:39:51,962
Did you love him without knowing his name and place?

508
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:57,008
Do you at least know he is a devil and a thief that stole lakhs of money?

509
00:39:57,143 --> 00:39:58,244
He is not such person.

510
00:39:58,324 --> 00:40:02,169
Men cheat mothers, who carry them for nine months in their womb and also their sisters.

511
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,660
Will they not cheat girl friends..

512
00:40:04,883 --> 00:40:06,498
..who they hardly know for two months?

513
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,221
Where does he stay?

514
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,615
Tell me!

515
00:40:10,352 --> 00:40:11,352
Near my house.

516
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,350
Did you find something suspicious?

517
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:15,273
I mean.. it is..

518
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:25,299
Yes!

519
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:31,438
Where will you escape?

520
00:40:31,654 --> 00:40:32,953
Tell me his name! - I will tell you!

521
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:34,913
Sampoornesh Babu!

522
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:37,444
Sir, this is his number. Okay.

523
00:40:43,111 --> 00:40:43,823
Who?

524
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:46,381
Police! Not ordinary police.

525
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,668
Bhairav! My name is Bhairav Rathod!

526
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:52,599
Yes? Did your heart skip beating?

527
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:54,236
If you hear my name..

528
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:58,169
I am thinking how much time it will take for your heart beat to stop.

529
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:01,071
Superb! I liked your guts.

530
00:41:01,265 --> 00:41:04,549
We like even Nagarjuna Sagar dam too upon seeing it.

531
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:07,016
After getting into it, we will know..

532
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:08,486
..its power.

533
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:10,275
I heard you are thin.

534
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:11,969
What will you do to me?

535
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:16,034
Look, dear. Do you know electric wire?

536
00:41:16,246 --> 00:41:18,312
Do you know Sachin Tendulkar's bat?

537
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,870
Do you know the knife of Rani Rudramadevi?

538
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,091
All are thin like me.

539
00:41:23,204 --> 00:41:25,815
One who faces them will know..

540
00:41:25,965 --> 00:41:27,239
..what their power is.

541
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,104
You escaped death once!

542
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:32,109
It is okay! This mistake will not happen from my side.

543
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,620
What are your guts?

544
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:35,454
I will show my guts!

545
00:41:35,564 --> 00:41:36,238
Hey!

546
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:37,641
Come! Come! Come!

547
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,422
Hey! Hey!

548
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:30,829
Surrender I say! We found proof to your thefts! Now you cannot escape.

549
00:42:34,457 --> 00:42:36,759
Hey, mister! This is the last warning.

550
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:40,555
I will spare your life if you surrender by yourself. Or else you will die.

551
00:42:40,865 --> 00:42:43,627
Think of it. Now you cannot escape anywhere.

552
00:42:43,808 --> 00:42:46,332
Enter state police has surrounded you.

553
00:42:46,528 --> 00:42:48,654
Will you come? Or should we start firing?

554
00:42:49,047 --> 00:42:53,955
Your fans are not here to wait for you by standing for hours. This is Andhra police!

555
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:03,292
You don't know my name. Bhairav! Bhairav Rathod!

556
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,966
I have seen many people like you in 30 years of my service.

557
00:43:09,317 --> 00:43:10,417
Surrender!

558
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:15,671
Tiger doesn’t eat tamarind rice if it is hungry.

559
00:43:16,452 --> 00:43:18,468
I will not fear you if you threaten it.

560
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:21,604
Call out with love.

561
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,403
He will show mercy!

562
00:43:23,821 --> 00:43:24,820
Plead him!

563
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,417
He will think.

564
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:28,101
Request him!

565
00:43:28,765 --> 00:43:30,014
He will come closer.

566
00:43:30,996 --> 00:43:32,429
Your right too is found!

567
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:33,876
Surrender!

568
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:36,647
Who is the right hand to whom?

569
00:43:37,054 --> 00:43:40,673
Millions of people will chant his name in future as sacred syllable!

570
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:43,555
They will follow his words like a law.

571
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:45,829
I am not his right hand!

572
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:48,491
He is the heart to my breathing.

573
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:50,882
He is the head to my breathing.

574
00:43:51,576 --> 00:43:53,853
He is everything to my..

575
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:55,472
Whoever he is, call him!

576
00:43:56,012 --> 00:43:57,857
My mouth might bleed blood..

577
00:43:58,331 --> 00:43:59,913
..but it will not utter the truth.

578
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:01,994
He will come out if I kill you.

579
00:44:02,428 --> 00:44:05,150
He will come and surrender if a bullet enters your head.

580
00:44:07,453 --> 00:44:09,556
Hey! I found your right hand!

581
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:13,301
You will be saved if you hand over your left hand to me and come to the station,

582
00:44:13,422 --> 00:44:16,531
Otherwise you will hear the sound of his death.

583
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,539
Brother! Don't come!

584
00:44:18,744 --> 00:44:20,290
Let anything happen to me!

585
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:22,313
You shouldn't surrender! - Wonderful!

586
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:25,572
There will be more sound before dying and more silence after death.

587
00:44:25,725 --> 00:44:27,949
Hey! I will count five.

588
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,692
One.. two.. three.. four.. five.

589
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,595
His life will be blown in after the count of five.

590
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,751
Your time starts now!

591
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:41,033
One.

592
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,613
Two.

593
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:44,233
Three.

594
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:48,147
Four.

595
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:55,543
Surrender, Sampoornesh Babu! Surrender!

596
00:45:52,648 --> 00:45:54,330
Who is pointing the gun at brother?

597
00:45:58,295 --> 00:45:59,944
Sampoornesh Babu?

598
00:46:00,654 --> 00:46:01,653
You?

599
00:46:06,065 --> 00:46:09,411
The name that will make every Telugu person feel proud..

600
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:12,453
Is it you? How come you commit thefts?

601
00:46:12,993 --> 00:46:14,886
What happened to this country?

602
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,741
If you say a single word

603
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:19,059
then lots of millionaires will give their entire property to you..

604
00:46:19,283 --> 00:46:21,952
..like an offering made to God.

605
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:24,131
You.. How come you commit thefts, sir?

606
00:46:24,725 --> 00:46:28,133
What happened? Your silence is killing me to death.

607
00:46:28,844 --> 00:46:30,556
Tell me what happened, sir.

608
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:32,546
Please leave my friend.

609
00:46:33,065 --> 00:46:34,454
Hey, leave him.

610
00:46:35,555 --> 00:46:37,109
You come inside with me.

611
00:46:40,391 --> 00:46:41,391
You too come.

612
00:46:58,755 --> 00:47:00,031
What are you watching, SI?

613
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:02,219
Are you thinking to arrest me under some law?

614
00:47:02,343 --> 00:47:04,652
Are you thinking to send me jail by branding me a terrorist?

615
00:47:04,895 --> 00:47:06,110
You are a bigger criminal than that.

616
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,700
Do you know how many families are destroyed because of you?

617
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,655
Pravan! You shut up! Do you know with whom you are talking?

618
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:14,410
If he wants then lots of countries would have lived by taking his name.

619
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:17,397
Why are you requesting him like that, sir? By the way, who this Sampoornesh Babu is?

620
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:18,819
Who..

621
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,135
Look, Commissioner..

622
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:22,711
There are people who can give crores of rupees if I ask.

623
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:24,305
They are people who can give up their lives..

624
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:28,690
But there is only one person whom I should save my giving up my life.

625
00:47:29,645 --> 00:47:31,453
In this life of Sampoornesh Babu..

626
00:47:31,964 --> 00:47:33,504
She has lit up my life with stars..

627
00:47:33,775 --> 00:47:36,443
She is going away from me with high speed..

628
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,998
She is Neelu.. Neelaveni.

629
00:47:47,025 --> 00:47:49,189
I am committing thefts and getting blamed for her.

630
00:47:50,616 --> 00:47:52,759
Do you know for what I worked hard all these days?

631
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:55,047
Do you know for what I made efforts for?

632
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:57,149
Do you know for what I worked to achieve>

633
00:47:58,813 --> 00:47:59,813
See there.

634
00:48:02,806 --> 00:48:05,334
Commissioner, you know about me.

635
00:48:05,817 --> 00:48:07,976
SI, you don't even know me.

636
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:10,970
You should know a person whom only I know.

637
00:48:11,587 --> 00:48:13,562
Though I am intelligent by myself..

638
00:48:13,913 --> 00:48:16,056
I like people who work hard.

639
00:48:16,506 --> 00:48:20,377
A scientist cannot design a rocket unless you give him 1000 crores..

640
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,767
But a hotel person gives food if you pay him 50 rupees and so he is greater to me.

641
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:27,025
I too decided to dedicate my life in doing hardwork..

642
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:29,801
..and worked as an electrician in electric shop.

643
00:48:30,184 --> 00:48:31,646
Many great companies..

644
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:34,812
..offered lakhs of rupees as salary after seeing Sampoo's work.

645
00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:38,946
But the happiness of earning 100 rupees after fixing a fuse in a house..

646
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:42,465
..cannot be gained after working in AC office for 24 hours.

647
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,806
That's why in order to make a place for myself in society..

648
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:46,547
..I started A to Z services.

649
00:48:54,782 --> 00:48:57,068
God!

650
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,759
God! Save me!

651
00:48:58,898 --> 00:49:01,484
Stop! Stop! Don't do like that. It is dangerous. Stop!

652
00:49:02,511 --> 00:49:04,895
God! Save me! - Did you call the police?

653
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,317
Did you call 108? - There is no hospital nearby.

654
00:49:08,217 --> 00:49:09,589
Did you call A to Z people?

655
00:49:09,764 --> 00:49:10,712
Who are they?

656
00:49:10,912 --> 00:49:13,143
Did you call Sampoornesh Babu? - Who is he?

657
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:15,558
Whether to put a thread into a needle..

658
00:49:15,808 --> 00:49:18,810
..or do service to an aeroplane.. everything happens only by him.

659
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,960
Hello?

660
00:49:25,404 --> 00:49:27,226
Hello. - Is it A to Z Sampoornesh Babu?

661
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,345
It has come.

662
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:51,237
Life is like a newly laid tar road.

663
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:53,600
Though it looks ready..

664
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:56,572
..it is not ready to travel until it gets dried.

665
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:58,437
We don't know it until I step on it.

666
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:00,285
My life too is similar.

667
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,099
Though it seemed everything is there in Sampoo's life..

668
00:51:03,363 --> 00:51:05,068
..the heart that has become stone..

669
00:51:05,439 --> 00:51:07,829
..didn't know it will grow until it was given water.

670
00:51:08,058 --> 00:51:11,391
Until then I didn't know that this tar road like life is ready to walt.

671
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:14,189
I would consider work to be my life.

672
00:51:14,308 --> 00:51:15,696
Like namaz to Muslims,

673
00:51:15,931 --> 00:51:19,669
ringing of church bells to Christians and Gayatri mantra to Hindus..

674
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:21,908
..a similar ringtone rang in my life.

675
00:51:29,977 --> 00:51:31,792
Hello. - Hello.

676
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:34,846
Who is it? - There is no electricity in my house.

677
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:37,594
I didn't ask I need electricity.

678
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:40,938
You are wonderful. I am saying there is power cut in my house.

679
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:44,427
So you should go and complaint at the police station..

680
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,070
..but why you are telling me.

681
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:49,019
Oh! It is not that.. in my house..

682
00:51:49,302 --> 00:51:52,009
Ugh! Go away! I don't know how to say.

683
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:55,843
Tell with your mouth. If you feel shy then tell over the phone.

684
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:00,818
Oh! I am unable to laugh at your jokes. Do something. Please.

685
00:52:00,937 --> 00:52:03,581
Okay.. okay.. tell me your house address.

686
00:52:03,672 --> 00:52:04,867
Why address?

687
00:52:04,987 --> 00:52:06,958
I will have to find where power got lost..

688
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:08,651
..and then bring it to your house.

689
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:11,010
Okay. Road number 12, Banjara Hills.

690
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,918
Your name?

691
00:52:13,853 --> 00:52:14,989
Neelu.

692
00:52:15,225 --> 00:52:16,399
Enough.

693
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:17,735
What?

694
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:21,861
Neelu. This name is enough. This is a treasure.

695
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:43,639
Where is the main?

696
00:52:43,858 --> 00:52:45,066
There..

697
00:52:49,171 --> 00:52:51,075
What happened? Is it found?

698
00:52:51,195 --> 00:52:51,754
What?

699
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:53,431
Oh! Electricity!

700
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:56,442
I am seeing.. I am seeing.. I am doing the same work.

701
00:52:56,614 --> 00:52:58,041
What are you seeing?

702
00:52:58,187 --> 00:53:00,025
Electricity.. electricity is there.

703
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:02,933
Okay.. okay.. fuse got damaged.

704
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:05,622
What does it mean?

705
00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:08,926
Government sends pure current to our house.

706
00:53:09,279 --> 00:53:11,811
When dust, sand and other poisonous things..

707
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,031
..enter the electricity then fuse gets damaged automatically.

708
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:21,229
Oh! Like how we have filter for water, there is fuse for electricity. I understood.

709
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:22,196
Correct.

710
00:53:22,276 --> 00:53:23,794
You are so great.

711
00:53:24,009 --> 00:53:27,984
I studied B. Tech but I still don't know it. What did you study? M. Tech.

712
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:29,239
No.

713
00:53:29,788 --> 00:53:31,204
B. Sc. Agriculture.

714
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:32,236
No.

715
00:53:32,357 --> 00:53:33,246
Then?

716
00:53:33,446 --> 00:53:34,446
Life.

717
00:53:56,849 --> 00:53:59,852
Look, Mr. Electricity. It is wrong to see a girl like that.

718
00:54:00,227 --> 00:54:03,025
If you tell me how to see then I will practice it.

719
00:54:03,254 --> 00:54:04,228
Look, electricity.

720
00:54:04,428 --> 00:54:07,806
My name is not electricity or house rent. It is Sampoo. Sampoornesh Babu.

721
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:12,702
Nice name. See Mr. Sampoo. Sampoornesh Babu. Your work is finished. Will you leave now?

722
00:54:12,822 --> 00:54:16,941
I gave electricity to your house but..

723
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:22,508
We need money to live life. I have sufficient money to live.

724
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:26,107
I came because a girl was suffering in darkness and not money.

725
00:54:26,274 --> 00:54:28,232
So will you not take money from everyone?

726
00:54:28,447 --> 00:54:31,687
When my own people wish to give or when I wish to take..

727
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:33,189
..I will ask and take it.

728
00:55:42,113 --> 00:55:43,420
Hello. - Hello.

729
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,769
Why did you call me again, Mr. Sampoo? Sampoornesh Babu.

730
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:48,097
Is there electricity?

731
00:55:48,177 --> 00:55:49,348
Yes, it is there.

732
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,752
It is nothing. I wanted to know when will go off.

733
00:55:52,907 --> 00:55:53,712
Why?

734
00:55:53,832 --> 00:55:56,205
I dropped my fuse in your house.

735
00:55:56,558 --> 00:55:58,370
To come and search again..

736
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,866
No need. I will give it if I find it.

737
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:03,733
No. Keep it with you if you find it.

738
00:56:05,051 --> 00:56:06,225
That is yours.

739
00:56:17,096 --> 00:56:19,948
Yes, brother? Are you not getting sleep?

740
00:56:21,596 --> 00:56:23,893
Yes, it is coming but leaving again.

741
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:29,093
Maybe it saw you with some other person in dream and so it left without disturbing you.

742
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:33,017
Who is it, brother? Sister-in-law? How did you know it?

743
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:37,106
How will any girl spare if there is a boy like you on road?

744
00:56:37,442 --> 00:56:41,058
Tell me who it is. - 50 kilograms of powder box..

745
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,470
..seems to be wearing Punjabi dress. - Brother, make it fast.

746
00:56:44,615 --> 00:56:46,034
We should eat marriage food.

747
00:56:46,854 --> 00:56:50,646
Do you think she loves me? - What do you lack? You are handsome.

748
00:56:50,726 --> 00:56:53,197
You look like a magnet of 60 kilograms wearing jeans.

749
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,934
You are handsome and also intelligent.

750
00:56:56,181 --> 00:56:58,249
Is it sufficient if one is handsome and intelligent?

751
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:02,444
Anyway you need some more qualities. You change your getup urgently.

752
00:57:02,774 --> 00:57:05,484
You tell her indirectly that you love her.

753
00:57:05,564 --> 00:57:09,043
Walk around her all the time so that she sees only you except during sleep.

754
00:57:09,381 --> 00:57:11,923
Definitely! She will definitely come to you!

755
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:13,690
Thanks.

756
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,506
I will start off from tomorrow. - Yes!

757
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,151
Yes, brother. Love? - No.

758
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:28,615
Mosquito.

759
00:58:31,076 --> 00:58:33,665
Hey, will girls fall if you run into them?

760
00:58:55,182 --> 00:58:56,789
Hey! Red pant!

761
00:58:58,069 --> 00:59:00,658
Don't you know lobe happens if you run into a person once?

762
00:59:00,778 --> 00:59:01,969
Will love happen if I run into a person once?

763
00:59:02,049 --> 00:59:05,259
Yes. Then come and run into me. Do it!

764
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,703
Brother! Shy?

765
00:59:35,986 --> 00:59:38,794
Brother, I am searching for you. Sister-in-law is singing a song there.

766
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:39,770
Where?

767
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:40,951
In Ravindra Sarathi.

768
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,129
Ravindra Sarathi?

769
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:43,589
Thanks.

770
00:59:48,577 --> 00:59:51,961
"The music inside me.."

771
00:59:52,306 --> 00:59:59,417
"..has merged with you. The happiness inside me..

772
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:06,988
"The seven ragas inside my ears.. you are the heart beat inside me.."

773
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:14,481
"..has merged with you. The happiness inside me..

774
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:18,027
"The seven ragas inside my ears.."

775
01:00:18,107 --> 01:00:19,205
Who is singing?

776
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:21,597
Her name is Neelu.

777
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,764
Her singing is similar to tsunami. She is next to Lata Mangeshkar.

778
01:00:25,844 --> 01:00:32,953
"For the invaluable love that I have for you.."

779
01:00:33,206 --> 01:00:39,959
"Show some love and make me yours.."

780
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:47,980
"God has created man, love and universe.."

781
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:55,356
"Why do you think of this? You take your own path.."

782
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:28,260
"The music inside me.."

783
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,981
"I have merged with you."

784
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:34,496
"The happiness inside me.."

785
01:01:34,576 --> 01:01:37,641
"The seven ragas inside my ears."

786
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:41,052
"I don't know what is there inside you and what happened to me.

787
01:01:41,132 --> 01:01:43,702
"I don't know what is there inside you and what happened to me."

788
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:50,416
"I don't know whether I can see you or have some place inside you."

789
01:02:10,484 --> 01:02:16,167
"This sweet wish shouldn't turn sour."

790
01:02:16,553 --> 01:02:22,923
"This sweet wish shouldn't turn sour."

791
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:29,258
"This is not attraction. Your existence is true."

792
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:35,380
"Will I ever see you again? Will I ever forget you?"

793
01:02:35,928 --> 01:02:43,096
"Life is a gift. When will I achieve your love?"

794
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:51,057
"Show mercy on me. I have merged in you."

795
01:02:51,537 --> 01:02:57,755
"The excitement inside me.. the seven ragas in my ears.."

796
01:03:28,713 --> 01:03:30,435
Neelu! Neelu!

797
01:03:37,227 --> 01:03:39,009
Neelu! Neelu!

798
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:41,534
Please, Neelu. Stop once.

799
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:42,875
Please!

800
01:03:45,006 --> 01:03:47,288
I don't understand why you got angry.

801
01:03:48,103 --> 01:03:49,972
What mistake did I commit?

802
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:53,454
Is it my mistake to convert the stones on you into flowers?

803
01:03:53,574 --> 01:03:57,825
Is it a crime to lend my dance to keep your respect?

804
01:03:57,945 --> 01:03:59,728
Please! Tell me why you beat me!

805
01:03:59,848 --> 01:04:03,423
You consider dance to be lending. That is our country's problem.

806
01:04:05,195 --> 01:04:07,425
Do you know what dance is?

807
01:04:07,823 --> 01:04:10,515
Meaning of dance is invaluable.

808
01:04:11,327 --> 01:04:17,192
Mostly Kuchipudi, Bharatnatyam, Bhojpuri, Chattisgarhi dances are India's treasure.

809
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:20,489
If you feel hungry in this country you should call our for mother

810
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:23,559
but in that country you should say 'bearer, come.'

811
01:04:23,755 --> 01:04:27,595
You will never understand the value of Mother India for being an Indian.

812
01:04:28,234 --> 01:04:32,077
Arvind Swamy, Santosh Pandit, Gautam Ghosh, Obul Reddy..

813
01:04:32,158 --> 01:04:34,759
This country has many such great dancers..

814
01:04:34,839 --> 01:04:37,765
..but it is our bad luck to have you and in turn it is your good luck.

815
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:40,290
Your mother carried you for nine months..

816
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,274
..but this Mother earth will carry you for 60 years.

817
01:04:42,354 --> 01:04:44,985
If you repay the favor to mother by conducting her funeral rites..

818
01:04:45,065 --> 01:04:47,439
..then understand what you should do to this earth.

819
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:48,162
Neelu..

820
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:49,570
Don't say anything.

821
01:04:49,898 --> 01:04:53,392
If possible then don't see me, hear me and talk to me.

822
01:05:33,858 --> 01:05:35,966
I want to talk you about something. Come upstairs.

823
01:05:42,442 --> 01:05:44,368
Why are you torturing me like this, Sampoo?

824
01:05:44,448 --> 01:05:46,717
What sin did I commit? What do you want?

825
01:05:46,797 --> 01:05:47,771
Forgiveness.

826
01:05:47,851 --> 01:05:52,033
Look, Sampoo. My effort and goal is to tell you about Indian's greatness and dance.

827
01:05:52,153 --> 01:05:55,177
If you felt hurt in doing so then forgive me.

828
01:05:55,532 --> 01:05:59,401
Look, Neelu. Remembers something in life. If fish lives in sea..

829
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:01,999
..there is no rule that says she should know the taste of salt.

830
01:06:02,465 --> 01:06:04,335
Similarly I am too born in this country.

831
01:06:04,874 --> 01:06:07,998
When I don't know the face of my mother who carried me for nine months..

832
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,324
..then how will I know the face of Mother India and

833
01:06:10,403 --> 01:06:12,517
her greatness when she is carrying me for so many years.

834
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:14,925
Don't you have mother?

835
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,392
I have but I don't know how she looks.

836
01:06:18,472 --> 01:06:19,810
Father?

837
01:06:20,058 --> 01:06:22,132
Even my mother doesn't know how he looks.

838
01:06:22,304 --> 01:06:23,290
So how did you grow up?

839
01:06:23,371 --> 01:06:26,110
I lived by picking up papers at railway stations.

840
01:06:26,475 --> 01:06:30,834
I drank tears and fulfilled my thirst.

841
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:34,389
I would light my clothes and study in its fire.

842
01:06:34,509 --> 01:06:36,660
I would beg passengers for toothpaste to brush my mouth..

843
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,031
..and fill my stomach with it.

844
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,235
When I was facing struggles like that, I met a man one day.

845
01:06:43,315 --> 01:06:44,818
He said there is a special talent in every person.

846
01:06:44,994 --> 01:06:46,752
He said one should invent it.

847
01:06:47,242 --> 01:06:51,517
I came up on my own since that day. I showed my talents in electrics to this world.

848
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:55,665
The most complicated problems which were not solved by even big engineers..

849
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:58,032
..were solved by me. But there is still something amiss.

850
01:06:58,296 --> 01:07:01,449
Until you entered the life of Sampoo like a beautiful flower..

851
01:07:01,703 --> 01:07:02,937
What are you saying, Sampoo?

852
01:07:03,093 --> 01:07:04,981
Though many girls chased me..

853
01:07:05,214 --> 01:07:07,356
..do you know why I am chasing you.

854
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:09,858
Your looks are amazing. Your smile is a flower.

855
01:07:09,938 --> 01:07:12,849
Your love is like a hot wind, your looks are breeze.

856
01:07:13,403 --> 01:07:15,336
Neelu, I love you.

857
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:19,557
It is okay. Take time and reply.

858
01:07:20,011 --> 01:07:22,892
Sampoo will be waiting for you consent.

859
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:26,750
Sampoo, there is nothing left to think.

860
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:30,654
I don't love you.

861
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:35,679
Yes, Sampoo.

862
01:07:35,759 --> 01:07:38,030
I don't love you. Why should I love you?"

863
01:07:38,229 --> 01:07:39,805
Yes! You are handsome.

864
01:07:39,925 --> 01:07:41,470
Any girl will like you.

865
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:44,979
Whenever I remember your face, I get excited.

866
01:07:45,926 --> 01:07:48,525
Are good looks and talents the only qualities required to fall in love?

867
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,019
You don't know who your parents are.

868
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:53,167
You don't know which place you belong to and your caste, lineage and anything.

869
01:07:53,247 --> 01:07:55,170
In fact this world doesn't know you.

870
01:07:56,256 --> 01:07:58,503
I don't need a six feet tall handsome like you.

871
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:00,648
People should become mad for him.

872
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:02,759
He should fight this world for me.

873
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:05,023
It shouldn't be his luck to love me.

874
01:08:05,103 --> 01:08:07,734
It should be my bad luck not to love him.

875
01:08:08,581 --> 01:08:10,923
The person who loves me should be a hundred percent man.

876
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,649
I don't need even if it is 99.9 percent.

877
01:08:16,486 --> 01:08:17,893
Forget me, Sampoo.

878
01:08:18,013 --> 01:08:20,375
Forgive me if I had raised any hopes in you.

879
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,497
Why should I love?

880
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:37,496
In fact the world doesn't know you.

881
01:08:37,641 --> 01:08:39,524
People should become mad for him.

882
01:08:39,644 --> 01:08:41,806
He should fight this world for me.

883
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:45,778
Hey, idiot!

884
01:08:45,898 --> 01:08:48,040
Are you blind? Where are you watching?

885
01:08:50,061 --> 01:08:52,893
Do you know the value of this phone? I bought it for 40,000 rupees recently.

886
01:08:53,936 --> 01:08:56,947
This phone is from America. I bought it by pawing my wife's jewellery.

887
01:08:57,027 --> 01:08:59,652
You look like an orphan. Anyway how do you know the value of wife?

888
01:08:59,732 --> 01:09:01,277
Parents give birth and throw them on roads.

889
01:09:01,357 --> 01:09:03,153
They don't know why they are born until they die.

890
01:09:11,031 --> 01:09:12,054
That's it! That's it!

891
01:09:12,265 --> 01:09:14,206
This country is like this and our lives too are like this.

892
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:16,154
Our lives will never change.

893
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,593
That day he said C. Now he said C++.

894
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:22,036
Today he said java. Tomorrow he will say bava.

895
01:09:22,156 --> 01:09:25,550
My heart is burning. Foreigners invent a news software daily..

896
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:27,586
..and we lose our entire money in learning it.

897
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,788
From where should I buy new computer now?

898
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:31,766
I feel like committing suicide.

899
01:09:32,473 --> 01:09:33,695
Calm down, brother. Calm down.

900
01:09:34,024 --> 01:09:35,406
Our software lives are like this.

901
01:09:35,608 --> 01:09:37,678
We should have thought while studying engineering.

902
01:09:37,893 --> 01:09:40,072
One day or the other a person will be born for the masses.

903
01:09:40,192 --> 01:09:41,875
People will talk about him.

904
01:09:41,995 --> 01:09:43,738
We should wait for that man.

905
01:09:43,818 --> 01:09:45,544
Our lives will not change until then.

906
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,378
Foreigners..

907
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:56,161
Foreigners invent new software daily.

908
01:09:56,389 --> 01:09:58,239
And we lose our entire money in learning it.

909
01:09:58,787 --> 01:10:00,610
From where should I buy a new computer now?

910
01:10:04,787 --> 01:10:06,391
Brother, how come you are here?

911
01:10:07,012 --> 01:10:09,658
Shastri, where are you? How are you?

912
01:10:09,778 --> 01:10:11,517
Brother, I am fine by your grace.

913
01:10:11,637 --> 01:10:13,351
No! No! Not my grace..

914
01:10:14,099 --> 01:10:15,077
..it is your hard work.

915
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:16,496
You are wonderful, brother.

916
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,334
You told me that technology is going to come..

917
01:10:18,454 --> 01:10:21,289
..and thereby gave a tester to me and also testing tools.

918
01:10:21,369 --> 01:10:23,489
Brother, I am settled now after setting up a internet cafe.

919
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:27,109
Internet cafe means where tea, samosas and biscuits are sold..

920
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:29,289
Brother, it is internet cafe.

921
01:10:29,569 --> 01:10:30,949
Not tea, samosa cafe.

922
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:32,521
What they do over there?

923
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:34,387
You can see the entire world by sitting there.

924
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:35,182
Here..

925
01:10:35,382 --> 01:10:36,427
This is the latest model.

926
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:37,941
It is launched in market recently.

927
01:10:38,095 --> 01:10:39,684
It works faster than rocket.

928
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,035
Movies, current bills..

929
01:10:42,115 --> 01:10:43,841
Everything.. everything is there inside.

930
01:10:44,465 --> 01:10:46,632
Wonderful! Is this a computer?

931
01:10:46,829 --> 01:10:47,509
Yes, brother.

932
01:10:47,589 --> 01:10:49,242
It is the same. - How much will it cost?

933
01:10:49,362 --> 01:10:50,621
70,000 rupees.

934
01:10:50,701 --> 01:10:51,531
What?

935
01:10:51,731 --> 01:10:52,938
70,000 rupees? - Yes, brother.

936
01:10:53,018 --> 01:10:54,978
We can buy a second hand car with that money.

937
01:10:56,114 --> 01:10:57,264
What can we do, brother?

938
01:10:57,344 --> 01:10:58,304
What is there inside?

939
01:10:58,383 --> 01:10:59,383
These..

940
01:10:59,726 --> 01:11:02,508
What? With these capacitors and conductors..

941
01:11:02,772 --> 01:11:04,360
..are the selling it for 70,000 rupees.

942
01:11:04,692 --> 01:11:05,715
This is cheating!

943
01:11:05,835 --> 01:11:08,208
Yes, brother. There is nobody to question.

944
01:11:10,993 --> 01:11:13,201
It will not cost even 2,000 rupees to manufacture them.

945
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:15,943
They are looting thousands of rupees. Why are you not asking?

946
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,064
What will we ask, brother?

947
01:11:17,184 --> 01:11:20,121
Foreigner is manufacturing and sending them. Local people sell them.

948
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,807
What? Foreigner? Aren't Indian companies manufacturing anything?

949
01:11:23,887 --> 01:11:24,585
No, brother.

950
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,976
Why? - Brother, it seems nobody asked this question.

951
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:29,629
Brother, though we have talent nobody is manufacturing it.

952
01:11:30,031 --> 01:11:32,859
Brother, time has come for genius people like you to think.

953
01:13:10,811 --> 01:13:11,966
One minute.

954
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,033
What do you want?

955
01:13:14,526 --> 01:13:15,529
Where is Sampoo?

956
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:17,207
Do you still remember that name?

957
01:13:17,455 --> 01:13:18,980
Please by mistake..

958
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:19,954
Not mistake..

959
01:13:20,154 --> 01:13:21,154
..it is a habit.

960
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,657
You humiliated brother by talking of India and culture.

961
01:13:25,002 --> 01:13:26,759
Is it Indian culture to humiliate a fellow Indian?

962
01:13:26,841 --> 01:13:29,663
Or is it culture to hurt a person without knowing the person who loves us?

963
01:13:29,747 --> 01:13:31,442
By the way, what do you know about brother?

964
01:13:31,563 --> 01:13:34,475
We were orphans living on roads. He gave us everything and nurtured us.

965
01:13:34,723 --> 01:13:36,616
People eat food on banana leaves.

966
01:13:36,737 --> 01:13:41,289
But he couldn't see my hungry and he cooked food for us with banana leaves.

967
01:13:41,945 --> 01:13:43,915
He sold tea and provided medicine for us.

968
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:46,202
He loved us like a mother when we were hungry.

969
01:13:46,282 --> 01:13:48,231
He scolded us like a father when we acted naughty.

970
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:49,952
Did you humiliate such person?

971
01:13:50,031 --> 01:13:54,435
You said you want a 100 percent man. There are two zero's in that 100.

972
01:13:55,537 --> 01:13:56,967
Anyway brother is not 100..

973
01:13:57,087 --> 01:13:58,638
One! Number one!

974
01:13:58,718 --> 01:14:01,451
If a meaning for the word man were to be written next to man in dictionary

975
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:03,386
then except the word Sampoornesh Babu..

976
01:14:04,035 --> 01:14:05,876
..no other word in the word fits there.

977
01:14:07,144 --> 01:14:09,352
You will never see brother. Forget him.

978
01:14:09,597 --> 01:14:14,999
I committed a mistake. I should say sorry to Samoo. Tell me where my Sampoo is.

979
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:18,177
I think it is better to die rather than living like this.

980
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:22,122
Where I close or open my eyes, he is there inside all the time.

981
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:26,617
I cannot live even for a minute without seeing him. Please tell me where he is.

982
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:30,159
The place where you slapped brother and humiliated him..

983
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:32,252
..the entire country is felicitating him.

984
01:14:32,332 --> 01:14:36,099
I loved him. It is my wish to see the entire country appreciate him.

985
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:37,179
Is it true, sister-in-law?

986
01:14:37,552 --> 01:14:38,644
Then go, sister-in-law.

987
01:14:38,935 --> 01:14:41,778
Brother will feel very happy if he knows it. Go fast.

988
01:14:41,858 --> 01:14:42,857
Thanks.

989
01:14:53,627 --> 01:14:55,713
Now Commissioner sir will inaugurate computer.

990
01:15:48,164 --> 01:15:49,640
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

991
01:15:50,048 --> 01:15:52,088
Today entire country should feel proud.

992
01:15:52,207 --> 01:15:55,858
First of all I thank the software association of Andhra Pradesh

993
01:15:55,938 --> 01:15:57,361
for inviting me to this program.

994
01:15:58,532 --> 01:16:00,690
These days Telugu language is ignored by many.

995
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:04,335
I appreciate the people who translated the word software in Telugu.

996
01:16:04,614 --> 01:16:06,453
Today we are here because of..

997
01:16:06,573 --> 01:16:08,612
..Sampoornesh Babu. If I had to tell about him..

998
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:10,531
..what should I say.

999
01:16:10,672 --> 01:16:12,099
By talking about him..

1000
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:14,498
..every organ inside my body becomes stiff.

1001
01:16:16,642 --> 01:16:19,258
We throw the match box that has letters 'Made in India' written on it.

1002
01:16:19,338 --> 01:16:23,272
But we rush to buy Chinese products in our state.

1003
01:16:23,392 --> 01:16:27,267
Soaps from Africa, perfumes from Bangkok.. we are becoming slaves to foreigners.

1004
01:16:28,068 --> 01:16:31,034
Mostly the youth of this country is unaware of cotton and rebellions.

1005
01:16:31,224 --> 01:16:33,730
Every time they think someone will come and do something..

1006
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,412
..they don't why they are living and whenever the sky weeps..

1007
01:16:37,668 --> 01:16:40,937
..every time the earth cracks up, a person is born in the society.

1008
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:44,344
We are ready to bow our head when he rules us.

1009
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:46,853
He.. He is Sampoornesh Babu.

1010
01:16:47,415 --> 01:16:50,906
Sir, I salute you with my hands.

1011
01:16:51,576 --> 01:16:53,964
The computers that you invented..

1012
01:16:54,044 --> 01:16:55,951
..I am buying three of them on the spot.

1013
01:16:58,263 --> 01:17:00,538
One day Sampoornesh Babu came to me..

1014
01:17:00,935 --> 01:17:03,025
..and said he wants to talk to me for 30 minutes.

1015
01:17:03,629 --> 01:17:05,663
I thought he is suffering from some disease.

1016
01:17:06,485 --> 01:17:08,550
But he asked about bacteria..

1017
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:11,637
..virus, fungus and other poisonous things..

1018
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,662
..and gathered lot of information about them.

1019
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,404
I replied with lot of patience.

1020
01:17:16,785 --> 01:17:19,057
I asked whether he is opening some hospital.

1021
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:20,914
He said no.

1022
01:17:21,468 --> 01:17:23,382
He said he is going to invent a machine..

1023
01:17:23,502 --> 01:17:26,736
..that will rule the entire computer world. I felt surprised.

1024
01:17:27,084 --> 01:17:29,308
By using some leafy vegetables..

1025
01:17:29,652 --> 01:17:34,268
..the way he explained me how computer runs with hybrid electricity..

1026
01:17:35,153 --> 01:17:38,214
..I felt he is not a man. He is a robot.

1027
01:17:38,675 --> 01:17:41,246
If he was born 300 years back..

1028
01:17:42,069 --> 01:17:44,913
..then I strongly believe that he would have cured cancer

1029
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,957
and typhoid with betel leaves and curry leaves.

1030
01:17:47,238 --> 01:17:51,057
For the future generation, God might exist in temple or not.

1031
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:53,234
Teachers may or may not present in school,

1032
01:17:53,315 --> 01:17:55,473
Children may or may not be lying in mothers' laps..

1033
01:17:55,762 --> 01:17:59,393
..but Sampoornesh Babu will remain in your hearts.

1034
01:18:05,364 --> 01:18:08,418
Today all the people who talked in this gathering..

1035
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:11,806
..are saying I invented something great. It is wrong.

1036
01:18:13,217 --> 01:18:17,953
The great seers born in this country have given many secrets in Vedas.

1037
01:18:18,162 --> 01:18:20,631
A small invention from them is this computer.

1038
01:18:21,074 --> 01:18:24,965
You must have heard the name of chips and computers of different companies.

1039
01:18:25,135 --> 01:18:29,121
They have become one and are selling an article that costs 100, 200 rupees..

1040
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:31,111
..at the cost of 70,000 rupees.

1041
01:18:31,231 --> 01:18:33,108
They are looting the income of this country.

1042
01:18:33,701 --> 01:18:35,931
In fact the expenses incurred in making this computer..

1043
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:39,797
..is just 450 rupees. I took a profit of 50 rupees..

1044
01:18:40,118 --> 01:18:42,146
..and selling it to you for 500 rupees.

1045
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:47,214
Hello, sir. I am the president of a company by name Ramanujan.

1046
01:18:47,486 --> 01:18:49,363
What is the guarantee that it will work?

1047
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:51,543
Many people said the same before too.

1048
01:18:51,734 --> 01:18:55,023
But in reality they didn't work properly.

1049
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:57,072
In case if what you are telling is true..

1050
01:18:57,309 --> 01:18:59,596
..then today I will buy one lakh computers.

1051
01:18:59,716 --> 01:19:02,236
You have seen low quality computers and therefore you said like that.

1052
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:04,196
Look at this computer.

1053
01:19:04,554 --> 01:19:07,559
Because of pure and filter water..

1054
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:12,239
..bacteria or virus will never affect this computer.

1055
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:15,179
Sorrel, turmeric and other leafy vegetables..

1056
01:19:15,483 --> 01:19:18,489
..are being used for this computer and they serve as anti-virus too.

1057
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,906
I reject your offer.

1058
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:25,018
I didn't invent it for millionaires like you.

1059
01:19:25,424 --> 01:19:28,309
I have invented it for poor students and children of this generation.

1060
01:19:30,353 --> 01:19:32,893
You are not well educated. Your background too is weak.

1061
01:19:33,013 --> 01:19:35,440
So how did you invent such a big thing?

1062
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,635
Bill Gates..

1063
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:38,241
Anil Ambani..

1064
01:19:38,634 --> 01:19:39,972
NTR, Chiranjeevi..

1065
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,256
These people have made progress on their work.

1066
01:19:42,593 --> 01:19:44,790
Person who has talent doesn't need background

1067
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:47,001
It is sufficient if there is ground inside brain.

1068
01:19:47,845 --> 01:19:49,745
Hard working person doesn't need studies.

1069
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,873
It is sufficient if he studies the society.

1070
01:19:52,995 --> 01:19:54,335
Food is needed to live..

1071
01:19:54,599 --> 01:19:56,309
..and not beauty.

1072
01:19:58,164 --> 01:20:01,887
A person who possesses all this will always have the blessings of public.

1073
01:20:02,329 --> 01:20:03,377
I am the example for it.

1074
01:20:03,497 --> 01:20:05,892
Who is the inspiration behind inventing this computer?

1075
01:20:11,544 --> 01:20:13,393
Yes! Love.

1076
01:20:14,866 --> 01:20:17,241
If a blind person were to climb Everest..

1077
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:19,959
Or if a blind person were to write poetry..

1078
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:21,545
Only love can do it.

1079
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,153
I loved a girl.

1080
01:20:24,684 --> 01:20:27,601
I started thinking when she said who you are.

1081
01:20:27,909 --> 01:20:31,874
My determination grew stronger when you said you want a 100 percent man.

1082
01:20:32,331 --> 01:20:36,226
This invention is for her. My wait is for her.

1083
01:20:37,743 --> 01:20:39,361
To achieve her love..

1084
01:20:39,948 --> 01:20:42,783
..I am ready to die for thousands of times.

1085
01:20:43,478 --> 01:20:48,333
That's why I had given it a name by combining our names. Neelu..

1086
01:20:48,748 --> 01:20:52,112
Samputer 1.25.

1087
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:58,183
I think she will understand my love at least now.

1088
01:20:58,366 --> 01:21:00,305
Sampoo, I understand it.

1089
01:21:04,851 --> 01:21:06,589
I love you, Sampoo.

1090
01:21:23,104 --> 01:21:25,802
Me.. do you love me?

1091
01:21:26,294 --> 01:21:26,853
Yes.

1092
01:21:26,973 --> 01:21:29,312
I am very lucky.

1093
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,993
Not your luck.. it is mine.

1094
01:21:32,113 --> 01:21:35,170
Had I become 100 percent man now?

1095
01:21:43,412 --> 01:21:47,154
Look, electricity. It is wrong to look at a girl like that.

1096
01:21:47,484 --> 01:21:51,506
My name is not electricity or house rent. Sampoo.. Sampoornesh Babu.

1097
01:22:12,002 --> 01:22:15,553
"Shivarathri for me and Sankranthi for you."

1098
01:22:15,825 --> 01:22:19,283
"I am the carnival and fun for you."

1099
01:22:19,564 --> 01:22:23,016
"Shivarathri for me and Sankranthi for you."

1100
01:22:23,296 --> 01:22:26,796
"I am the carnival and fun for you."

1101
01:22:27,304 --> 01:22:30,500
"I liked your smile very much."

1102
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:34,508
"That should belong to me forever. I am its owner."

1103
01:22:34,785 --> 01:22:37,973
"There is a festival in the smile."

1104
01:22:38,052 --> 01:22:41,978
"That should belong to me, my beloved."

1105
01:23:04,285 --> 01:23:09,651
"You have cast spell on me with your gait."

1106
01:23:10,053 --> 01:23:15,112
"I fell for your smile and became your slave."

1107
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:21,053
"You have cast spell on me with your gait."

1108
01:23:21,302 --> 01:23:26,899
"I fell for your smile and became your slave."

1109
01:23:27,074 --> 01:23:28,936
"You created a ripple inside me.'

1110
01:23:29,055 --> 01:23:30,794
"The wind is blowing with high speed."

1111
01:23:30,874 --> 01:23:32,704
"You created a ripple inside me.'

1112
01:23:32,784 --> 01:23:34,317
"The wind is blowing with high speed."

1113
01:23:34,397 --> 01:23:37,598
"I am getting confused with your good looks."

1114
01:23:38,131 --> 01:23:41,811
"I am getting confused with your good looks."

1115
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:45,537
"Shivarathri for me and Sankranthi for you."

1116
01:23:45,617 --> 01:23:49,218
"I am the carnival and fun for you."

1117
01:24:08,198 --> 01:24:13,041
"You were caught like jalebi but you slipped out soon."

1118
01:24:13,806 --> 01:24:18,637
"You poured all over me like honey."

1119
01:24:18,717 --> 01:24:24,355
"You were caught like jalebi but you slipped out soon."

1120
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:29,955
"You poured all over me like honey."

1121
01:24:30,825 --> 01:24:32,590
"Like laddoos.."

1122
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:34,563
"By treating you with sweets.."

1123
01:24:34,643 --> 01:24:36,374
"Like laddoos.."

1124
01:24:36,454 --> 01:24:38,088
"By treating you with sweets.."

1125
01:24:38,168 --> 01:24:41,381
"I have feasted them with my mouth."

1126
01:24:41,847 --> 01:24:45,805
"I have feasted them with my mouth."

1127
01:25:09,734 --> 01:25:11,915
Who is the Sampoo? Where is he from?

1128
01:25:12,939 --> 01:25:17,727
He defeated all the countries? I really don't understand what is happening here.

1129
01:25:18,294 --> 01:25:20,937
I want to know all this details right now.

1130
01:25:21,099 --> 01:25:23,403
Sampoornesh Babu. He is six feet tall.

1131
01:25:23,483 --> 01:25:25,533
He will come here in 30 minutes if we provoke him.

1132
01:25:25,831 --> 01:25:29,269
All these years we sold computer worth 1000 rupees for 70,000 rupees.

1133
01:25:29,522 --> 01:25:32,897
Now the entire country is coming out in rebellion because of Sampoornesh Babu.

1134
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:36,887
If we leave it like this then we will have to sell computers for 750 rupees in future.

1135
01:25:37,005 --> 01:25:39,171
If we have to do it then we will have to sell our properties.

1136
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:40,072
Buy him!

1137
01:25:40,243 --> 01:25:42,108
He is not a shampoo that can be bought for money.

1138
01:25:42,293 --> 01:25:44,261
He is Sampoo. He wants his..

1139
01:25:44,341 --> 01:25:46,195
..left hand's nail to be used for this country.

1140
01:25:46,275 --> 01:25:48,534
He is so patriotic. We cannot buy him with money.

1141
01:25:48,797 --> 01:25:50,299
We cannot kill him with disease.

1142
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:51,935
We cannot make him fall trap.

1143
01:25:52,896 --> 01:25:55,952
If he were to be killed then someone should come from somewhere.

1144
01:25:56,412 --> 01:25:57,989
At present no such person took birth.

1145
01:25:58,401 --> 01:26:00,950
Yes - Who? - Mamba. - Mamba?

1146
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,609
Welcome Mr. Mamba.

1147
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:18,093
I am not a guest who needs formalities for coming.

1148
01:26:18,609 --> 01:26:20,337
Tell me the work that you called me for.

1149
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:25,446
How much you will give? When will you give? How will you give?

1150
01:26:25,566 --> 01:26:27,954
It is not easy. He is not a normal person.

1151
01:26:30,778 --> 01:26:33,280
Talk only about deal with Mamba.

1152
01:26:33,965 --> 01:26:36,088
Don't talk with helplessness.

1153
01:26:41,084 --> 01:26:42,084
Take it!

1154
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:45,942
He looks like a perfume body. Who is he?

1155
01:26:46,022 --> 01:26:47,625
Kill him as soon as possible.

1156
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:49,049
It will cost 50,000.

1157
01:26:49,169 --> 01:26:50,369
We will give you one lakh.

1158
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,514
It will cost two crores.

1159
01:26:52,633 --> 01:26:53,452
What?

1160
01:26:53,652 --> 01:26:54,496
Two crores?

1161
01:26:54,694 --> 01:26:56,212
You just told me 50,000.

1162
01:26:56,397 --> 01:26:59,229
There are offers on Dussehra and Diwali festivals.

1163
01:26:59,743 --> 01:27:01,357
We should take it when they are given.

1164
01:27:01,995 --> 01:27:04,939
If you say you will buy after the offer is finished..

1165
01:27:05,397 --> 01:27:07,821
..then you will have to buy at the price that I quote.

1166
01:27:07,971 --> 01:27:09,357
Okay. We will give you.

1167
01:27:09,526 --> 01:27:10,980
I will go and kill him.

1168
01:27:23,162 --> 01:27:24,388
Where are you, hero?

1169
01:27:24,508 --> 01:27:25,715
I was busy with work.

1170
01:27:25,795 --> 01:27:30,626
Yes. Yes. You will wait on roads until you love. After that you will leave us on roads.

1171
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:34,356
Neelu, it is not that. There are some mistakes in the formulae.

1172
01:27:34,606 --> 01:27:35,867
So I am checking it.

1173
01:27:35,947 --> 01:27:40,786
Do it. Do it. Neelu 1.25 has become more important to you than this Neelu.

1174
01:27:41,382 --> 01:27:43,857
Idiot! Are you coming now or not?

1175
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:53,712
Hey! Is she the girl?

1176
01:27:53,792 --> 01:27:54,925
Yes, brother.

1177
01:27:57,175 --> 01:27:58,175
Hello!

1178
01:27:58,988 --> 01:28:01,751
She looks great like a hen wearing makeup.

1179
01:28:02,138 --> 01:28:03,110
Who are you?

1180
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:05,928
Who are you? Don't do anything to me.

1181
01:28:06,097 --> 01:28:09,352
I am not like her. Leave me.

1182
01:28:09,739 --> 01:28:12,634
Don't these heroines have other dialogues?

1183
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:14,684
Hello! Where are you?

1184
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:18,152
Where is your boy friend? What is his name?

1185
01:28:18,516 --> 01:28:19,466
Shampoo?

1186
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:20,628
Sampoo!

1187
01:28:21,178 --> 01:28:23,063
What is your confidence?

1188
01:28:23,143 --> 01:28:27,888
You are trying to play with volcano for lighting up a cigarette. That's it.

1189
01:28:28,819 --> 01:28:30,967
If you make me take one step forward..

1190
01:28:31,614 --> 01:28:35,352
..or if you stop without taking a step back,I will agree you are a man.

1191
01:28:35,432 --> 01:28:36,285
Hey!

1192
01:28:36,485 --> 01:28:37,988
Take her into the vehicle.

1193
01:28:53,771 --> 01:28:56,039
What do you want? - Formula.

1194
01:28:56,119 --> 01:28:59,733
You asked formula so easily.

1195
01:28:59,853 --> 01:29:02,845
Who had sent you? Is it those foreign people?

1196
01:29:03,941 --> 01:29:06,189
Tell them! Tell them!

1197
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:08,726
If I start killing..

1198
01:29:08,847 --> 01:29:10,960
..then proclainers should come to collect the pieces.

1199
01:29:11,395 --> 01:29:13,743
You should dig drainage for the blood flow.

1200
01:29:13,863 --> 01:29:15,530
If you take my name then..

1201
01:29:16,659 --> 01:29:17,333
Yes!

1202
01:29:17,453 --> 01:29:19,776
I will make you do it. I will make you do it with these hands.

1203
01:29:29,659 --> 01:29:30,748
Not now, brother!

1204
01:29:30,972 --> 01:29:33,806
By watching his anger, I think he will send all of us to cemetery in parcel.

1205
01:29:33,886 --> 01:29:35,721
Brother, we will find the right time and kill him.

1206
01:29:35,841 --> 01:29:36,898
Hey! Sampoo!

1207
01:29:37,329 --> 01:29:41,885
This country will still have computer if your formula is lost but if your Neelu is lost..

1208
01:29:42,194 --> 01:29:43,799
You will not stay alive!

1209
01:29:49,024 --> 01:29:51,589
This country will still have computer if your formula is lost.

1210
01:29:51,911 --> 01:29:54,937
But what if your Neelu is lost.

1211
01:30:16,173 --> 01:30:17,543
Where are you going, Sampoo?

1212
01:30:18,473 --> 01:30:20,079
Are you returning this computer?

1213
01:30:20,902 --> 01:30:22,598
Are you giving your formula too?

1214
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:23,597
No, Neelu.

1215
01:30:23,677 --> 01:30:24,821
What no, Sampoo?

1216
01:30:24,983 --> 01:30:27,284
Are you giving the wealth of this country for my sake?

1217
01:30:27,365 --> 01:30:28,873
Where you stay, that is my country.

1218
01:30:28,953 --> 01:30:31,218
The place that doesn't have you is graveyard to me.

1219
01:30:31,299 --> 01:30:33,888
Let the lover of a coward stay anywhere, it is similar to graveyard.

1220
01:30:33,969 --> 01:30:35,451
Neelu, listen to me.

1221
01:30:35,773 --> 01:30:37,311
I cannot live without you.

1222
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:38,884
Sampoo, I don't exist for you anymore.

1223
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:41,084
Whether you live or die, it is your wish.

1224
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,117
Yes, Sampoo? What did you think?

1225
01:30:58,237 --> 01:31:00,878
Brother, it will be difficult if you still think.

1226
01:31:01,472 --> 01:31:03,031
Time is nearing.

1227
01:31:03,151 --> 01:31:04,943
Time has begun just now, brother.

1228
01:31:05,023 --> 01:31:08,399
Wonderful! I became your fan only after seeing this anger.

1229
01:31:08,882 --> 01:31:10,421
So you will not give it.

1230
01:31:10,605 --> 01:31:13,635
You are a black dog working under white foxes.

1231
01:31:14,166 --> 01:31:15,579
I will not fear you.

1232
01:31:16,315 --> 01:31:16,990
I will not fear you.

1233
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:19,103
She left in car just now.

1234
01:31:19,503 --> 01:31:22,585
I am making arrangements to send her to graveyard in few minutes.

1235
01:31:24,442 --> 01:31:25,548
Death will not come with intimation.

1236
01:31:25,628 --> 01:31:30,711
But I told you by shouting in DTS and said you have a lover, so be careful.

1237
01:31:32,564 --> 01:31:35,371
Try to save her! - Hey!

1238
01:32:00,906 --> 01:32:02,161
Stop, Neelu!

1239
01:32:05,438 --> 01:32:06,725
Brother, she is coming.

1240
01:32:24,209 --> 01:32:27,616
"Shivarathri for and Sankranthi for you."

1241
01:32:27,696 --> 01:32:29,418
"I am the fun."

1242
01:32:30,012 --> 01:32:31,288
"You are my sweetheart."

1243
01:32:31,368 --> 01:32:34,852
"Shivarathri for and Sankranthi for you."

1244
01:32:35,059 --> 01:32:36,214
"I am the fun.."

1245
01:33:19,852 --> 01:33:20,853
Sampoo.

1246
01:33:26,691 --> 01:33:29,386
Please don't leave me and go.

1247
01:33:29,572 --> 01:33:31,043
I will not go anywhere, Neelu.

1248
01:33:31,395 --> 01:33:34,850
Sampoo, I will not live anymore. I am able to understand it.

1249
01:33:35,309 --> 01:33:36,802
Don't talk like that, Neelu.

1250
01:33:37,442 --> 01:33:39,306
I cannot live without you.

1251
01:33:43,653 --> 01:33:44,868
One minute.

1252
01:33:47,009 --> 01:33:48,009
What happened?

1253
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:52,317
Sampoo, you should live even if I die.

1254
01:33:53,011 --> 01:33:55,339
Neelu, there is no you and me in love.

1255
01:33:56,081 --> 01:33:58,264
It is only we.

1256
01:33:58,783 --> 01:34:02,840
If you were to die then I will rise from the pyre.

1257
01:34:03,919 --> 01:34:06,237
Sampoo, I will live at least for you.

1258
01:34:06,317 --> 01:34:08,226
Neelu, I will live only for you.

1259
01:34:16,354 --> 01:34:17,178
Sir..

1260
01:34:17,258 --> 01:34:18,258
You?

1261
01:34:18,651 --> 01:34:20,426
Doctor! Please, doctor!

1262
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:24,385
Save my Neelu at any cost. Please, doctor.

1263
01:34:24,465 --> 01:34:25,853
Okay.. okay.. I will see to it.

1264
01:34:36,617 --> 01:34:38,246
Doctor called you.

1265
01:34:45,115 --> 01:34:46,342
What happened, doctor?

1266
01:34:47,508 --> 01:34:49,280
Babu, God doesn't have a heart.

1267
01:34:49,532 --> 01:34:51,701
Only people possessing good hearts will face troubles and shed tears.

1268
01:34:51,783 --> 01:34:53,298
Oh! What happened to my Neelu?

1269
01:34:54,634 --> 01:34:57,007
Have you seen it? From the current tyre to the steering..

1270
01:34:57,128 --> 01:34:59,536
..and from steering to her heart..

1271
01:34:59,865 --> 01:35:03,782
..her ventricles, articles, nerves and everything..

1272
01:35:04,195 --> 01:35:07,328
Everything got damaged badly. Now her life is..

1273
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:08,593
Doctor!

1274
01:35:10,549 --> 01:35:12,806
I know the sorrow one goes through..

1275
01:35:13,019 --> 01:35:14,514
..when her beloved is dying.

1276
01:35:14,783 --> 01:35:16,775
But you have become a scapegoat..

1277
01:35:17,226 --> 01:35:18,164
..in the game played by destiny.

1278
01:35:18,244 --> 01:35:20,931
No! No! No! No, doctor!

1279
01:35:21,011 --> 01:35:22,860
I cannot live without my Neelu.

1280
01:35:23,526 --> 01:35:25,862
Isn't there any solution to save my Neelu?

1281
01:35:25,942 --> 01:35:26,976
Almost no!

1282
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:28,631
But..

1283
01:35:29,247 --> 01:35:30,295
Tell me, doctor.

1284
01:35:30,494 --> 01:35:32,444
I will save her by giving up my life.

1285
01:35:32,524 --> 01:35:34,977
Life is not needed. It is heart.

1286
01:35:35,195 --> 01:35:36,524
What are you saying?

1287
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:39,005
Yes. She needs a heart that suits her.

1288
01:35:39,207 --> 01:35:40,319
Then put my heart.

1289
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:43,376
You are giving your heart as easily as a button.

1290
01:35:43,693 --> 01:35:46,037
My heart is weeping by watching your love.

1291
01:35:46,306 --> 01:35:49,118
I was sure that you will give it so I have checked the size of your heart.

1292
01:35:49,453 --> 01:35:50,743
Your heart doesn't fit her.

1293
01:35:50,822 --> 01:35:52,537
Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!

1294
01:35:52,617 --> 01:35:55,195
Instead of saying all this, kill me with that electricity.

1295
01:35:55,315 --> 01:35:57,802
Even though we cannot live together, we will die together.

1296
01:35:58,132 --> 01:36:00,086
Please! Please! Please!

1297
01:36:01,376 --> 01:36:03,511
But there is another solution.

1298
01:36:03,852 --> 01:36:05,289
What is it? Tell me, doctor.

1299
01:36:05,782 --> 01:36:07,086
It is not as easy matter.

1300
01:36:07,166 --> 01:36:11,356
I will drag the sun with rope and bring it to you in order to save my Neelu.

1301
01:36:11,436 --> 01:36:12,618
Doctor, tell me what do you want.

1302
01:36:12,698 --> 01:36:13,757
Artificial heart.

1303
01:36:13,877 --> 01:36:14,554
What?

1304
01:36:14,711 --> 01:36:17,566
Artificial heart. It is being developed in foreign countries in recent times.

1305
01:36:18,269 --> 01:36:20,554
That machine will do the work of heart.

1306
01:36:20,836 --> 01:36:22,157
So keep it, doctor.

1307
01:36:23,234 --> 01:36:24,872
It will cost crores of rupees, Babu.

1308
01:36:24,992 --> 01:36:25,936
Crores?

1309
01:36:26,137 --> 01:36:28,249
Will such a small machine cost crores?

1310
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:30,431
Babu, it is an english heart invented by foreigner.

1311
01:36:30,511 --> 01:36:31,969
Cheating! Cheating! Cheating!

1312
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:34,647
The size of computer is too small but it costs thousands of rupees.

1313
01:36:34,846 --> 01:36:36,909
The size of heart is less than our fist and it costs crores of rupees.

1314
01:36:37,029 --> 01:36:38,838
Doctor, doesn't foreigner have pure heart?

1315
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:41,977
What can we do, Babu? Our local talent is looking for opportunities abroad.

1316
01:36:42,531 --> 01:36:44,296
Talented people like you in our country..

1317
01:36:44,485 --> 01:36:47,172
..don't have opportunities. We cannot do anything now.

1318
01:36:47,388 --> 01:36:48,518
It is there!

1319
01:36:49,496 --> 01:36:51,034
I will design that heart.

1320
01:36:51,154 --> 01:36:51,866
You?

1321
01:36:51,985 --> 01:36:56,431
I have invented computer to fall in love. Will I not invent a heart to save my love?

1322
01:36:56,551 --> 01:37:00,026
Not only heart, only love has the capacity to make even God.

1323
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:03,709
Hey, foreigners! This Indian throws a challenge with a heavy heart.

1324
01:37:03,789 --> 01:37:05,461
Heart worth crores of rupees..

1325
01:37:05,879 --> 01:37:08,659
..I will invent it without much effort. This Sampoornesh Babu will do it.

1326
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:12,108
Babu, computer is electronics. Heart is medicine.

1327
01:37:12,735 --> 01:37:14,598
Science, physics, biology, history..

1328
01:37:14,718 --> 01:37:16,506
They should surrender in front of love.

1329
01:37:16,586 --> 01:37:19,897
I will give heart to you in a month. You give Neelu to me.

1330
01:37:20,067 --> 01:37:22,964
If you could really bring the heart then it is my duty to save her.

1331
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:27,840
Leave it to me! I will sacrifice my heart but I will save her life.

1332
01:37:28,094 --> 01:37:30,095
This is my challenge.

1333
01:37:51,941 --> 01:37:57,330
"Where does this journey leads to? Victory will be yours very soon."

1334
01:37:57,666 --> 01:38:02,600
"Until then your efforts will not stop."

1335
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:09,016
"Nobody has seen such a thing before. Have you sacrificed your heart?"

1336
01:38:09,226 --> 01:38:16,168
"All the loves till date salute you."

1337
01:38:39,051 --> 01:38:44,352
"You didn't study MBBS."

1338
01:38:44,829 --> 01:38:50,494
"But still you life to love."

1339
01:38:50,614 --> 01:38:55,533
"That's why you became successful."

1340
01:38:56,233 --> 01:39:01,056
"You don't have these facilities."

1341
01:39:01,569 --> 01:39:07,247
"Your queen's heart possesses bulbs."

1342
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:13,022
"You have to design a heart with it."

1343
01:39:13,515 --> 01:39:19,848
"Your pure love story is a milestone."

1344
01:39:21,334 --> 01:39:22,678
"Who is she?"

1345
01:39:24,755 --> 01:39:26,122
"Who is it?"

1346
01:39:28,318 --> 01:39:29,946
"Who is she?"

1347
01:39:42,358 --> 01:39:47,532
"You didn't study MBBS."

1348
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:53,379
"But still you life to love."

1349
01:39:53,919 --> 01:39:58,802
"That's why you became successful."

1350
01:39:59,639 --> 01:40:04,893
"You are the best than many unsuccessful lovers."

1351
01:40:05,353 --> 01:40:10,235
"You don't have these facilities."

1352
01:40:10,677 --> 01:40:16,378
"Your queen's heart possesses bulbs."

1353
01:40:16,933 --> 01:40:22,301
"You have to design a heart with it."

1354
01:40:22,691 --> 01:40:28,377
"Your pure love story is a milestone."

1355
01:40:34,004 --> 01:40:36,700
Please bear it, sir. Bear it.

1356
01:40:42,339 --> 01:40:45,947
Forgive me, Sampoornesh Babu. I thought criminals are those who commit crimes.

1357
01:40:46,584 --> 01:40:49,494
I couldn't understand there is a heart behind every criminal

1358
01:40:49,574 --> 01:40:51,094
and a story behind every crime.

1359
01:40:53,074 --> 01:40:55,064
They say there is a woman behind every successful man.

1360
01:40:55,184 --> 01:40:58,234
But your love has proved that there will be a lover

1361
01:40:58,314 --> 01:41:01,736
behind every defeated girl to achieve victory. I salute your love, sir.

1362
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:06,102
My Commissioner's father is in jail but he always sports a smile

1363
01:41:06,182 --> 01:41:07,757
but now he is moved to tears..

1364
01:41:12,262 --> 01:41:15,484
But after working so hard and after going through so much grief..

1365
01:41:15,921 --> 01:41:19,055
..I am unable to give the heart at the last moment.

1366
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:22,660
She will be operated after one hour.

1367
01:41:23,605 --> 01:41:26,803
If I don't go then it will be last respiration.

1368
01:41:27,135 --> 01:41:28,913
Who said you are not going, Babu?

1369
01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:30,209
What are you saying, sir?

1370
01:41:30,289 --> 01:41:31,576
Yes, Pranav. Yes.

1371
01:41:32,044 --> 01:41:34,564
People who steal crores of rupees are entering politics from jail

1372
01:41:34,644 --> 01:41:36,013
and murderers are entering parliament.

1373
01:41:36,206 --> 01:41:38,905
Should Babu go to jail for committing thefts

1374
01:41:38,986 --> 01:41:41,071
for the sake of that innocent girl and her love?

1375
01:41:41,336 --> 01:41:43,676
No! - Sir, you are taking the law in your hands.

1376
01:41:43,756 --> 01:41:44,875
Yes, SI! Yes!

1377
01:41:45,074 --> 01:41:46,525
I am taking law into my hands.

1378
01:41:46,645 --> 01:41:48,180
I will crush it with these fists.

1379
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:50,803
If releasing Sampoornesh Babu is a crime according to law

1380
01:41:50,883 --> 01:41:52,801
then arrest me Pranav. Arrest me.

1381
01:41:53,765 --> 01:41:55,612
Sir, for my sake you are..

1382
01:41:55,821 --> 01:41:56,821
Yes, Babu.

1383
01:41:57,045 --> 01:42:00,451
The condition of India has become worse for ignoring the talents like you.

1384
01:42:00,852 --> 01:42:02,889
White people too are born like how we are born.

1385
01:42:03,447 --> 01:42:05,242
Rather than the silence of ten intelligent people..

1386
01:42:05,362 --> 01:42:07,861
..one Sampoornesh Babu's brain is great.

1387
01:42:08,395 --> 01:42:10,462
You go, Babu. You go.

1388
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:14,377
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1389
01:42:17,894 --> 01:42:20,190
Doctor, patient's condition is very critical.

1390
01:42:28,792 --> 01:42:31,194
Hello, doctor? - Sampoornesh Babu, where are you?

1391
01:42:31,901 --> 01:42:34,228
Condition is very serious here. You come fast.

1392
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:36,695
I will be there in 15 minutes, doctor.

1393
01:42:37,365 --> 01:42:39,710
Okay, doctor. Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

1394
01:43:04,405 --> 01:43:05,473
Hello.. Hello.

1395
01:43:20,942 --> 01:43:22,751
Now God can only save.

1396
01:43:39,276 --> 01:43:40,277
Hey!

1397
01:43:41,176 --> 01:43:44,298
Hey! - Ah! - Hey!

1398
01:43:44,834 --> 01:43:45,884
Ah!

1399
01:43:46,005 --> 01:43:48,470
Come! Come! See my muscles!

1400
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:50,367
Beat me if you have guts.

1401
01:43:51,803 --> 01:43:52,657
God!

1402
01:43:52,737 --> 01:43:54,236
Muscles don't grow there!

1403
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,459
Give the thread.

1404
01:45:04,645 --> 01:45:06,550
Sampoo, you are a genius.

1405
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:08,256
Who is this Sampoo, sir?

1406
01:45:08,924 --> 01:45:11,888
Slave! Love of slave!

1407
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:20,079
Brother.. - Brother..

1408
01:45:20,161 --> 01:45:22,192
Brother! - Sampoo! - Brother!

1409
01:45:23,437 --> 01:45:25,532
Brother! Put him here. - Doctor.

1410
01:45:34,595 --> 01:45:36,593
Doctor! - Brother! - Brother!

1411
01:45:44,645 --> 01:45:47,366
Brother.. - Doctor, Neelu has regained consciousness.

1412
01:45:53,006 --> 01:45:55,204
Are you alright? Do you want something?

1413
01:45:57,078 --> 01:46:00,459
Not something. Doctor, ask do you want anybody?

1414
01:46:02,544 --> 01:46:04,279
Where is my Sampoo, doctor?

1415
01:46:05,367 --> 01:46:06,557
Tell me, doctor.

1416
01:46:07,593 --> 01:46:09,710
Please take me to him.

1417
01:46:10,295 --> 01:46:12,140
Nurse, bring her out.

1418
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:13,261
Sir..

1419
01:46:13,638 --> 01:46:14,639
It is okay..

1420
01:46:15,235 --> 01:46:16,475
What happened, doctor?

1421
01:46:19,007 --> 01:46:20,007
Come, I will tell you.

1422
01:46:37,789 --> 01:46:39,101
Sampoo!

1423
01:46:39,181 --> 01:46:40,534
Sampoo!

1424
01:46:43,466 --> 01:46:44,885
Sampoo!

1425
01:46:44,965 --> 01:46:46,110
Sampoo!

1426
01:46:51,293 --> 01:46:53,166
The scoundrel who injured you..

1427
01:46:53,516 --> 01:46:55,270
..has killed Sampoo.

1428
01:46:55,736 --> 01:46:57,935
He died by saving you.

1429
01:46:59,146 --> 01:47:02,631
What happened, doctor? - Knife pierced his heart..

1430
01:47:02,919 --> 01:47:04,231
.. and it caused internal injury.

1431
01:47:04,428 --> 01:47:06,122
He therefore died due to heavy bleeding.

1432
01:47:11,264 --> 01:47:16,728
You.. Did you give your heart to her by risking your life, Sampoornesh Babu?

1433
01:47:19,367 --> 01:47:22,204
Sampoornesh Babu, today you may not have heart but

1434
01:47:22,395 --> 01:47:24,399
as long as universe exists, your sacrifice will be remembered.

1435
01:47:26,976 --> 01:47:31,699
Did you give your heart to her by risking your life, Sampoornesh Babu?

1436
01:47:32,047 --> 01:47:34,506
Sampoornesh Babu, today you may not have heart..

1437
01:47:35,565 --> 01:47:38,160
Doctor, remove my heart and give to Sampoo.

1438
01:47:41,198 --> 01:47:42,474
What are you saying?

1439
01:47:42,747 --> 01:47:45,522
Yes! Remove my heart and give it to him.

1440
01:47:45,788 --> 01:47:47,825
Have you gone mad? He is dead.

1441
01:47:47,943 --> 01:47:51,780
What? Did my Sampoo die? Whose heart is this? Isn't it his heart?

1442
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:55,936
He is the words inside my ears.. he is the breath in my nose.. he is my heart beat..

1443
01:47:56,637 --> 01:48:01,212
My Sampoo didn't die. He will remain alive in every heart that loses hope in love.

1444
01:48:03,026 --> 01:48:07,731
I wanted to love and marry a 100 percent man in my life.

1445
01:48:07,852 --> 01:48:14,090
One such person died today without a heart. No! This heart cannot tolerate it.

1446
01:48:15,721 --> 01:48:19,681
He is not an inefficient person to die abruptly. He is Sampoornesh Babu.

1447
01:48:20,073 --> 01:48:22,330
Whether the tiger is alive or dead, it is still powerful.

1448
01:48:22,472 --> 01:48:24,394
Please don't say no to my wish, doctor.

1449
01:48:24,919 --> 01:48:27,298
Yes, doctor. Yes. She is telling the truth.

1450
01:48:27,564 --> 01:48:30,946
Sampoornesh Babu gave the definition of love and Neelu has proved it correct.

1451
01:48:31,066 --> 01:48:33,422
These days love is considered as fire in the bedroom..

1452
01:48:33,542 --> 01:48:36,989
These days love is considered as party..

1453
01:48:37,251 --> 01:48:39,369
In spite of knowing that heart cannot be taken back..

1454
01:48:39,449 --> 01:48:41,420
in spite of knowing that the person without heart cannot live again..

1455
01:48:41,649 --> 01:48:44,971
She is ready to sacrifice. We should appreciate her. We shouldn’t criticize her.

1456
01:48:45,694 --> 01:48:47,395
If you think what you will gain in return then it is called business.

1457
01:48:47,475 --> 01:48:49,175
What you go without expecting anything in return is called love.

1458
01:48:49,255 --> 01:48:51,623
Neelu's sacrifice of today is an example for future generations.

1459
01:48:51,772 --> 01:48:53,861
Sampoo may not live with her heart.

1460
01:48:54,014 --> 01:48:56,395
But it is better for the person, who gave her his heart,

1461
01:48:56,475 --> 01:48:58,795
to leave this world with his heart than going alone.

1462
01:48:59,117 --> 01:49:00,697
Agree , doctor. Agree.

1463
01:49:01,688 --> 01:49:04,120
By watching Neelu's sacrifice today..

1464
01:49:04,558 --> 01:49:06,682
..I think whether mine is love or not.

1465
01:49:07,278 --> 01:49:09,112
Transplant her heart to my Sampoo..

1466
01:49:09,435 --> 01:49:11,303
..and make him hundred percent man.

1467
01:49:11,589 --> 01:49:13,786
I have seen people killing themselves for love.

1468
01:49:14,792 --> 01:49:16,441
I have seen people killing too.

1469
01:49:17,399 --> 01:49:19,911
But Sampoo who created heart for love..

1470
01:49:20,546 --> 01:49:22,977
And Neelu who is bidding adieu with her body organ..

1471
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:25,897
This is not a heart poem..

1472
01:49:26,469 --> 01:49:28,164
This is the story of heart.

1473
01:49:38,873 --> 01:49:44,525
"You went to extremes and achieved this victory."

1474
01:49:44,645 --> 01:49:49,818
"That's why I offer my condolences."

1475
01:49:50,401 --> 01:49:56,017
"Nobody has ever done it. Dear beloved, you have sacrificed your love."

1476
01:49:56,137 --> 01:50:00,951
"You have lost your heart for my sake."

1477
01:50:13,789 --> 01:50:18,461
"No educated person will match you.."

1478
01:50:19,630 --> 01:50:25,098
"You are my bride lying on pyre.."

1479
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:30,272
"I will live with the heart you have given."

1480
01:50:31,173 --> 01:50:35,261
"I will die with the organ that will never come back."

1481
01:50:35,341 --> 01:50:37,434
There is no you and I in love.

1482
01:50:37,856 --> 01:50:40,584
You said here is only the word we.

1483
01:50:40,956 --> 01:50:44,215
Now you are not there and even though I am alive, I don't exist.

1484
01:50:44,753 --> 01:50:48,657
Sampoo, when we don’t exist then for whom did you sacrifice yourself for.

1485
01:51:25,849 --> 01:51:26,848
Come! - hey!

1486
01:51:30,931 --> 01:51:33,095
Sampoo! Leave me!

1487
01:51:33,331 --> 01:51:34,568
Sampoo!

1488
01:51:34,804 --> 01:51:36,022
Leave!

1489
01:51:37,488 --> 01:51:38,674
Sampoo!

1490
01:51:38,915 --> 01:51:40,616
Where is Sampoo now?

1491
01:51:40,869 --> 01:51:43,233
He is leaving! He is leaving!

1492
01:51:51,223 --> 01:51:54,023
What? Will he come?

1493
01:51:54,838 --> 01:51:56,134
Call him!

1494
01:51:58,175 --> 01:51:59,770
Sampoo!

1495
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:01,255
Call him!

1496
01:52:02,292 --> 01:52:04,530
Sampoo!

1497
01:52:10,393 --> 01:52:13,726
If you were to die then I will rise from the pyre..

1498
01:52:49,576 --> 01:52:52,286
Stop! Babu will take care of it. Leave!

1499
01:53:04,297 --> 01:53:06,541
Kill him!
