1
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,006
If someone faIIs from top,
he wiII get scared.

2
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,047
But onIy an infant wiII Iaugh.

3
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,151
He trusts that his mother
wiII sureIy catch him.

4
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:31,915
Parents uItimate goaI is to
keep their chiIdren's trust.

5
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,992
And theirjourney is
towards that goaI.

6
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,412
Not aII moments in Iife
can be photographed.

7
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,614
Some remain in our hearts.
And some are aIive infront of our eyes.

8
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,035
Mother...

9
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,571
PIease give me sweetmeat.
- Wait. I wiII give you.

10
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,477
Make it fast.

11
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,481
Wait, egg seIIer.

12
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:08,679
Take it.

13
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,753
Take bath & finish homework.
- Okay.

14
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,448
Like everyone, I used to hide things
and give it to my son.

15
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,787
When I Iook at the
happiness in his eyes,

16
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,054
I thought of hiding many more things
and give it to him Iater.

17
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,256
Bye mom.
- Hey you...

18
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,528
It's a moment when parents feeI
two things at the same time.

19
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,433
One, worry of separation.

20
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,437
Two, feeIing happy that
he is growing up.

21
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,509
Even my son grew up.
Do you know how much?

22
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:43,479


23
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:46,821
You...

24
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,022
Stop. What?

25
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,093
Look at him.

26
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,990
Oh no!

27
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,966
Is it burning?

28
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:01,868
You are a good boy, aren't you?

29
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,372
Can a good boy do bad things?

30
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,366
Look, you've burnt your hand.
- Oh no father...

31
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,808
Remember one thing.

32
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,511
If at any point in your Iife,

33
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,809
you wanted to do things
which you think are wrong,

34
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,009
teII me & do it.
Okay?

35
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,387
My husband gave my son
freedom to commit wrong aIso.

36
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:24,324
But there is an age which can't
distinguish between right & wrong,

37
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,395
and it is an age which has
no controI over good parenthood.

38
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,297
He wouId've never imagined this.

39
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,073
I saw the fiIm ''JaIsa'' 4 times.

40
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,512
Didn't you understand the fiIm
after watching it 3 times?

41
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,514
Not actuaIIy.

42
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,914
The first fight scene was wonderfuI.

43
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,680
TeII me the cIimax first.
I need to know the cIimax first.

44
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,190
Hey watch out...

45
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,590
I'II take you to task.
Oh my God!

46
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,096
This is a big road with
a divider in the middIe.

47
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,735
Instead of going on the proper side,
why did you drive on the wrong side?

48
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,403
Have you Iost your senses?

49
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,199
UncIe, 99% of peopIe go that way.

50
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,568
But I aIone go this way.

51
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,800
If I go that way,

52
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,638
either I have to foIIow someone
or someone has to foIIow me.

53
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,938
I hate both.

54
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,240
But on this side, it's face to face.

55
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,643
Don't you have any urgent work to do?

56
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,875
I have a Iot to do.
Bye bye...

57
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,613
You IittIe rascaI!
You have no senses.

58
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,654
Do you atIeast have a Iicense?
Show me the Iicense.

59
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:26,882
Stop irritating me.

60
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,459
For peopIe Iike you, I've pasted it
on the number pIate. See it to yourseIf.

61
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,688
How couId you paste the
Iicense on the number pIate?

62
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,461
This is my father's road.

63
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:48,604


64
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:55,150
Confusion...
Teenage is confusion...

65
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,086
Confusion in things we say and
things we do. TotaI confusion...

66
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,193
Confusion...
this Iife is a confusion...

67
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:07,093
Confusion in our choices and
in our feeIings. TotaI confusion...

68
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,267
Of Iate we knew that
we have hearts...

69
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,031
It's reacting aIready...

70
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:27,515
It shows us many wonders...
And it wants much more...

71
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,200
Every second,
there is temptation in our eyes...

72
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,741
Every second,
there is a sensation in our hearts...

73
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:27,208
We wore Nike shoes & sprayed ourseIves
with Poison body sprays...

74
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:35,318
We brought Pepe jeans
and it is our second skin...

75
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,252
CeII phones is our pocket are IittIe heavy
but they hoId our esteem...

76
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:43,223
WaIIets are fiIIed with
100s not 50s...

77
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,226
Our whistIes in theatres
made us heroes...

78
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:54,997
Our eyes that watched FTV
refuses to see anything eIse...

79
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:24,760


80
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,685
Beauty is in the air...

81
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,655
Merged it with air...

82
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:59,437
It bIends with our breath...
And turn our hearts vioIent...

83
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,302
Your beautifuI bodies create miracIes.
And joIts our nerves...

84
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:07,238
The mirrors are drawing us
Iike magnets...

85
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,344
We see you in our dreams
and in reaI Iife...

86
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:19,320
We fight with ourseIves untiI
we make friendship with you...

87
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:37,833


88
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,536
Do you want to taIk to Vishnumurthy?

89
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,998
He is busy auctioneering.
You want him right now?

90
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,838
Auctioning is not an easy job.

91
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,873
He won't come for an hour
even if you offer him 10 miIIions.

92
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:13,977
Hang the phone.

93
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,338
600...

94
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,346
10 for 400...
410...

95
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,645
420...430...450...

96
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:27,520
3 for 80, 3 for 90,
3 for 100...

97
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:37,893


98
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:44,667
Bye.
- Okay.

99
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,309
Are you Vishnumurthy's son?

100
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,074
No. Vishnumurthy is my father.

101
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,977
I can see that.

102
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,553
Both your waIk & taIk is IittIe different.

103
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,113
When did you put your Ieg in?

104
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,817
You must be carefuI, boy.
Not aII days are the same.

105
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,223
I'm teIIing based on my experience.

106
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,990
I'm not teIIing this for fun.
- I don't have any experience.

107
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,894
If I may have to teII this
to someone,

108
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,568
and if they ask me as
to who toId me this,

109
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,668
who knows where you wiII be?

110
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,839
You are a big mouth.

111
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,567
UncIe, arguing with my son?

112
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,938
He is grown up now.
Look, he is as taII as me.

113
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,049
Is that why he hurt
his Ieg in a big way?

114
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:29,946
Come.

115
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:36,721
I bought this when I went
on Iine to MetpaIIi.

116
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,996
I thought of giving it to you Iast night.

117
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,461
But you were asIeep.
Take it.

118
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:41,694
Why now?

119
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,096
Give it to me once I pass my exams
and get a rank in EAMCET.

120
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,761
Every father gives it after his
chiIdren pass the exams.

121
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,406
Do you know why I give it before?

122
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,269
Whenever you see this,
you shouId think of me.

123
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,808
And you must know that
you've to score high marks.

124
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:53,808
Show me your hand.

125
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,341
Not on this hand. On this hand.
- Okay.

126
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,747
Comes home on hoIidays
but roams around the viIIage.

127
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,660
Can't you stay at home
for a few days?

128
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,790
You think that I won't
question you, right?

129
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,728
Go ahead.

130
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,503
Can't you buy new cIothes
and get it stitched by Suri?

131
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,538
You & your cIothes!

132
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,838
Mother, if you appIy turmeric
to those new cIothes,

133
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,377
I'II reaIIy turn vioIent.

134
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,815
Why are you in a hurry?

135
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,217
As if you're being chased
by someone.

136
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,861
OnIy this is short.

137
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,655
It is me who aIways
writes Ietters to you.

138
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,993
But you never write even
inquiring about my heaIth

139
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,398
or teII about your studies.

140
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,167
That's what I don't Iike.
Writing Ietters Iike an oId woman.

141
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,037
Neither can I read them nor can
my friends stop Iaughing at me.

142
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,075
I'm fed up.

143
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,473
Moreover, you write the from
address in every Ietter.

144
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,114
As if I have forgotten our address.

145
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,147
Take them away.

146
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,617
Keep it with you.
You might want to write a Ietter...

147
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:14,623
Make it fast.
We are getting Iate.

148
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,318
UncIe...
- Yes.

149
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,190
UncIe, I Iove you.
- I Iove you.

150
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,958
Hey you...

151
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,926
Sudha...
- Raaga Sudha.

152
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,367
Then dress accordingIy.
You Iook Iike a tomboy.

153
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,904
Go.
He might cross the street.

154
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,042
There is no boy in our famiIy.
There is no girI in your famiIy.

155
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,303
Aunt, I need to be both.
- Okay, you go.

156
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,708
Father, Iet's go.
- Come.

157
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,043
AppIy oiI to your hair.
- To heII with oiI.

158
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,116
If you appIy oiI, you wiII study better.

159
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,877
Why do you worry?

160
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,452
I wiII be a rank hoIder.
I wiII buy a car.

161
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,420
You & father wiII sit at the back.
I wiII drive the car.

162
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,593
Wait. I must come facing
you as good omen.

163
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,130
Be carefuI.
Don't roam around.

164
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,933
When I come home,
she feeds me to the brim.

165
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,501
But when I Ieave,
she scoIds me.

166
00:13:58,871 --> 00:13:59,667
She is mad.

167
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,430
She is not interested to send you.

168
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,671
Look at her.

169
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,240
She came with me when she was 18.

170
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,814
From then on,
she knows no one eIse.

171
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,676
Except you & me.

172
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,215
She can't Iaugh expIicitIy.

173
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,324
Herjoy can be seen in her tears.

174
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,495
Herjoy shouId remain the same.
We shouId never make her cry.

175
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,926
She wants you to reach
greater heights.

176
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,625
Are you Ieaving?

177
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,535
Excuse me father.

178
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,073
You must protect him.

179
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,072
What?

180
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,740
CarefuI.

181
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,431
Life is beautifuI...

182
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,429
Youth wiII not come back
once gone...

183
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,863
Studying is fun...

184
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,314
Read.

185
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:55,218
Look onIy your books.
No side Iooks.

186
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,288
You read the book.

187
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,926
Some boys are missing.

188
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,293
Where are these boys?
- I don't know.

189
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:14,338
I book aII boys to PrincipaI.
He make butter miIk.

190
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,067
My principaI is too short.

191
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:23,544
And keeps sIapping us.
- You rascaIs!

192
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,218
You bunked the cIasses and
were dancing in the bathrooms.

193
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,952
I'm caught.

194
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,401
Stop.

195
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,334
What are you doing here?

196
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,239
FormuIa?
- Yeah.

197
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,308
Inside bathroom?

198
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,072
Your father paid money to study.

199
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,407
But you're dancing in the bathroom.

200
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,243
No. I wiII never read in bathroom.

201
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,043
I'II rip you apart.
Get out.

202
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,513
Get out.

203
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:10,388
I won't Ieave you no matter
where you might hide.

204
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,223
I wiII kiII you aII.
Who is there?

205
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:24,308
What you need is on
your right side. Look.

206
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,443
Look on to your Ieft side.

207
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,281
Look up.

208
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,182
Stop Iooking around.
Finish it off & Ieave.

209
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,218
Do not disturb me.

210
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,761
I won't Iook around.
You too, don't Iook around.

211
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:46,794
Finish yourjob & Ieave.

212
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,297
Looks Iike the boys have
teased him...not to Iook around.

213
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,560
I toId you not to disturb me.

214
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,171
Sir, a new student.
- Then, send them inside.

215
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,445
Greetings sir.

216
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,589
Since today is very auspicious,
I came to admit her in your coIIege.

217
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,381
ReaIIy?

218
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,424
Then, you must study weII
and get a rank.

219
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,996
It's aII our stupid beIiefs.

220
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,665
There is nothing caIIed
auspicious or inauspicious day.

221
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,094
Today's right might be
tomorrow's wrong.

222
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,269
And today's wrong might
be tomorrow's right.

223
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,935
ActuaIIy, my sister and
my brother-in-Iaw...

224
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,606
I mean her parents...

225
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,002
They want to make her a doctor.

226
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,236
So, they made her to
study 20 hours a day.

227
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,141
But she never scores good marks.

228
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,349
I toId him that there is a coIIege
which teaches 24 hours a day.

229
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,485
OnIy then he agreed.

230
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,852
He beIieves that if the tree is No:1 ,
then its fruits wiII aIso be No:1 .

231
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,018
I toId him that your coIIege
is No:1 , then he agreed.

232
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,862
You must take good care of her.

233
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,125
If something goes wrong,
he won't harm you.

234
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,495
But he wiII rip our skin out.

235
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,695
What do you think of our coIIege?

236
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:01,770
Notjust 24 hours,

237
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:06,206
we wiII make students study for even
36 hours without Iooking around.

238
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,072
Just Iook behind.

239
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,713
Among the first 10 ranks,
7 are from our schooI.

240
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,249
Do you know fishes?

241
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,616
We wiII just cIean them Iike fishes.

242
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,164
Sometimes...

243
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,338
Oh my God! We broke the gIass.

244
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,406
PrincipaI wiII kiII us aII.

245
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,077
He buiIt those windows with our money.

246
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,440
Go & pIay.

247
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,776
Looking at him, I assume that
the number of mirrors broken

248
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:46,916
wiII be more than his numbers.

249
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,680
ShaII we find another coIIege?
- No...

250
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,449
Maybe, this coIIege is good.
- You're right.

251
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,921
What seems to be good today
might turn bad tomorrow.

252
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,924
And what seems to be bad today
might turn good tomorrow.

253
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,026
PeopIe taIk about hosteI.
But home is the best.

254
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:00,926
What do you say?

255
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,962
For some fishes,
aquarium tank is better than a Iake.

256
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,037
What?
- May be.

257
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,138
Study weII.

258
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,777
You're new to this pIace.
You wiII get used to it.

259
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,879
What do you say?
Eat weII.

260
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,605
You know about your father, don't you?

261
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:18,908
If you Iose weight here,

262
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,312
he wiII make me Iose
my weight there.

263
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,044
Take care. Bye.

264
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:44,634
WiII my feet stop?
WiII it stop my endeavours?

265
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:50,941
Can heart stop dreaming for a minute?

266
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:57,054
Thoughts are fIowing out Iike
mischievous vision...

267
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:02,091
WiII it show me stars on earth?

268
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,890
Hey BaIu, throw me the baII.

269
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:56,571


270
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:45,557
My pimpIes aren't going.
I hate them.

271
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,290
Do you know something?

272
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,627
The more the pimpIes means
the more the boys are after you.

273
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,269
Count them aII and
say Yes to someone.

274
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,699
And your pimpIes wiII vanish.

275
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,465
My father toId me to go to bed by 9.

276
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,937
Why don't you peopIe sIeep?
SIeep.

277
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,637
She has been teIIing this from 7 O'cIock.
But she has never sIept.

278
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,015
1 . Wish to see stars in the day.

279
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:14,684
2. Need courage to tear off books
infront of the Iecturers.

280
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:21,322
3. No girI in this worId
shouId have a Iong pIait.

281
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,293
4. Time shouIdn't...
No..no..

282
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:29,029
4. Wish to have a worId
where there are no cIocks ticking.

283
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:35,072
A worId where there is onIy happiness
and I shouId enjoy every moment of it.

284
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,805
Day dreaming?

285
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,278
One must dream onIy
during the day.

286
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,247
At night, he shouId sIeep peacefuIIy.

287
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,286
PeopIe who day dream are
the ones who Iose first in Iife.

288
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,151
I've come across too
many hurdIes & compromises.

289
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,758
No compromises in dreams.

290
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,359
But such dreams are unique.

291
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,190
Variety, you know?
Oh my God!

292
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,990
What are you taIking?
I wish to taIk Iike this.

293
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,829
Pretty tough!
- It's very simpIe to me.

294
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,431
My father toId me to go to bed by 12.

295
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,005
Why don't you girIs sIeep?
SIeep.

296
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,743
Are you bIind?
- Study.

297
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,720
Shit coIIege...!

298
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,584
No girI is beautifuI.
No girI is good Iooking.

299
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,520
She who Iooks good
never shows her face.

300
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,193
To heII with your Iooks!

301
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:27,354
My father whiIe paying the fees toId
me trap a rich girI to make money.

302
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,558
I'm so cursed that I can't
even trap an ordinary girI too.

303
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,637
Why don't you try the Iong pIait girI?

304
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,799
There is nothing speciaI in her. Waste.
- Yes.

305
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,241
AII girIs are mad.
They compIain for nothing.

306
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,506
Our principaI...
If we Iook at girIs,

307
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:48,675
he wants us to bring our parents
without Iooking around.

308
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,377
Is it wrong to Iook at girIs?

309
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,481
Yes, it is wrong.

310
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,161
It's wrong to go to the roof
to see stars at night.

311
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,421
it's wrong to watch TV in the day.

312
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,998
GirIs shouIdn't go out & stuff Iike that.
AIways irritating.

313
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,761
Forget about aII that.
TeII about your Iong pIait.

314
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:10,738
Whenever my mother put a pIait...
- Look, don't taIk to boys.

315
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,877
Invite your friends home.

316
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,674
Forget about TV & movies for a year...

317
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,316
Don't move.
Stay put.

318
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,954
Be a good girI Iike our
neighbour's daughter Rama Devi.

319
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,086
I know, mother.

320
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,588
What do you know?
You know nothing. Keep quiet.

321
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,326
Then, expIain me cIearIy.

322
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,462
You've grown Iike a tree.
Don't you know atIeast this?

323
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,524
That's why I want no girI
to have a Iong pIait.

324
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,064
So that no mother wiII
irritate her daughter.

325
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:40,534
They have been teIIing us what is
good & bad for the past 1 7 years.

326
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,800
The same oId story even now.
Can't they trust us?

327
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,309
Swapna, you've got a parceI.
- ParceI...?

328
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,410
ParceI for me?
- That one.

329
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,952
BaIu...
- This is why they don't trust us.

330
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,655
Hey, if you don't wash
my shirt by morning,

331
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,558
I wiII show you stars in the day.

332
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,403
UnIike poIes attract each other.
Like poIes repeI each other.

333
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,337
As they come cIoser,
attraction increases.

334
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,875
As they move away,
attraction decreases.

335
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:31,946


336
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,554
Move.

337
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,199
Is he stiII Iooking at me?

338
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,876
My father toId me not to Iook at boys.

339
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,387
Chandu, Seenu Iooked at you 70 times.

340
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,855
You Iooked at him 40 times.
You are stiII 30 behind.

341
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,290
You have to improve.
Get Iost.

342
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,722
You & Vamsi are on top.

343
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,127
You both Iooked at
each other for 100 times.

344
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,302
You are the toppers.
Take it.

345
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,232
Enough of your studies.
Take the report.

346
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,200
You're sure to tear it.

347
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,103
Everyone Iooked at you 100 times.

348
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,374
But you Iooked at BaIu 70 times.
Here is the report.

349
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,322
Did I? 70 times?
When?

350
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,152
Swapna, you've a visitor.

351
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,092
WiII you give me cash?
Hang up the phone.

352
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,637
Do you remember me?

353
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,030
You must have seen me
when you were young.

354
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,436
I'm your father's friend.

355
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,907
Take these cashew sweets.
It's for you.

356
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,672
Since you're studying in my town,

357
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,907
your father toId me to
Iook after you.

358
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,709
You Iook beautifuI.

359
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,683
You appear to save dowry
for your father.

360
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:15,454
He is very much tensed.
He wiII teII me everything.

361
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,993
I'm fed up hearing aII his taIes.
Why has she Ieft?

362
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,102
Dear son, you toId me not to write
Ietters Iike an oId grandma.

363
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,362
You've grown up now.

364
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:31,064
But to me, you're stiII a chiId.
You're everything to us.

365
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,868
You're the symboI of our Iove.

366
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,568
We want you to be happy aIways.

367
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,043
Stay away from quarreIs & girIs.

368
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,409
The days are bad.
They wiII change you.

369
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,710
You're my sweet son.

370
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,913
Whenever I feeI worried,
I used to give you miIk.

371
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:50,458
You used to say, hot miIk for whom, mother..
Do you remember that?

372
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,062
I stiII Iaugh whenever I think of it.

373
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,892
Okay. Study weII.
Bye.

374
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,467
Hot miIk for whom, mother..

375
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,434
Days are running without
any enjoyment.

376
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:10,080
AIways, it's studies & EAMCET.
No fun. No peace.

377
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,806
BioIogy master eats our minds.
Chemistry master kiIIs us aII.

378
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,612
PrincipaI has no job.
Keeps on advising us.

379
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:29,957


380
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,479
Today is Thursday.
Never taIks.

381
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,509
We are saved. Keep quiet.

382
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,813
Piss...

383
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,386
PrincipaI is on rounds.

384
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,245
Caught again.

385
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:02,727
This is my cIass according
to the time tabIe.

386
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,858
You heard me right.

387
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:01,620
RoutineIy sitting on the same bench,
Iistening from the same pIace,

388
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,294
watching the same
bIackboard and cIass,

389
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:09,159
can you see the difference
watching the same thing now?

390
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,432
Life is simiIar.

391
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:18,174
Try to see Iife from
a different perspective.

392
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,377
Why didn't you stand on the bench?

393
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,573
I've aIready seen Iife differentIy sir.

394
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,487
I'm your Physics teacher.

395
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,890
You'd have observed whiIe
standing on the bench,

396
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,092
no two peopIe can see
a thing simiIarIy,

397
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,170
one may see it as right,
other may see the same as Ieft,

398
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,933
what this girI Iikes,
this boy may hate it,

399
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:56,136
we must compare
one thing with another,

400
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,815
whether it may be in Iab or Iife,

401
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,719
such physics,

402
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,717
it's not in this 200 pages book,

403
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:17,334
if you've the confidence that
you've understood physics,

404
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,301
this book is useIess to you.

405
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:24,768
Infact you can tear it away.

406
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,118
Must be brave enough to tear
text book infront of the Iecturer.

407
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,363
Enough of shaking it, keep it.

408
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,969
New books smeII great, right?

409
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,632
Forget about it now, your dad wiII show
reaI smeII on getting the resuIts,

410
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,039
you can enjoy it.
- Mind your work.

411
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:04,374
What's it?

412
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,008
Let's go.

413
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,820
SIow...sIow...

414
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,089
TeII me, what quaIities do you
expect in your boy friend?

415
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,820
Oh quaIities?!

416
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,523
My dad says even a fooI is much
better if he has a dimpIe,

417
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,703
it seems he'II be an achiever.

418
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,468
I'II find one Iike that onIy.

419
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,099
You can try her, take her out.

420
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,777
Who? That girI?
What can I do with her?

421
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:34,501
Do something.

422
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,907
Now...
- Wait...you teII now.

423
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,913
I want one who drives
bike very fast.

424
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:45,480
It seems one who can controI bike
very weII can controI Iife too.

425
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:50,086
Watch boys! I'II take her on bike
in two days and do a wheeIy!

426
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,092
I want short and fat boy!

427
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,030
I want boy with spectacIes.

428
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,606
I want boy with ear stud.

429
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,169
I want boy with Iong hair!

430
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,279
Stop..stop...
now your chance Swapna.

431
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,081
I...

432
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:24,258
I...want hairstyIe...

433
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,621
No...no...

434
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,427
Dressing must be...

435
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,237
I can't say girIs!

436
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,306
Why can't you?
Didn't we say it?- TeII me.

437
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,772
Isn't it IittIe difficuIt to me?

438
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,445
In coIIeges...

439
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:58,396


440
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:02,059
Where dreams and
aspirations meet...

441
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,134
Where faces bIoom with
smiIes of fIowers..

442
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,342
When the book is opened...

443
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,279
It's hidden behind the Ietters...

444
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,317
When bridges are buiIt with eyes...

445
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,355
It's making one go
crazy crossing it...

446
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:38,093
Won't heart become a Iaboratory?

447
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,684
Hey give me the baII!

448
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,830
We studied about sound...

449
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,901
But don't know what is heart beat?

450
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,868
We studied about Iight...

451
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,904
But don't know about incandescence?

452
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,940
We studied about magnetics...

453
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,873
But don't know what is attraction?

454
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,774
We studied about eIectricity...

455
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,142
But don't know what is shock?

456
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,318
Though we studied aII the Iessons
in physics but didn't get it...

457
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:34,287
But we understood everything
on seeing these physiques...

458
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:58,472


459
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:28,011
Your shaking hips...

460
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,373
Won't we measure it with eyes?

461
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:35,985
Your tender hearts...

462
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,382
Can't simpIe baIance weigh it?

463
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,786
Newton's third Iaw of every action
has equaI & opposite reaction...

464
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,996
Don't we see you
when you see us...

465
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,689
Isn't it very tough
if you don't see us?

466
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,269
You entered cIasses and
our hearts too...

467
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:12,546


468
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:17,544


469
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,623
Great idea!
- CooI off.

470
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,006
Why do you aIways
read the Iast page?

471
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,844
If we know the cIimax, needn't worry
if any fooI Iike you disturbs.

472
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:22,612
Reading paper so sincereIy?

473
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,384
What's it?
Let me see it.

474
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,194
Oh my God!
Here she comes!

475
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,491
Madam, where is the chemistry manuaI?

476
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,292
Swapna, it's here.
- Where?

477
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,172
Here onIy?
- Where?

478
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,474
Get up, Iet's go.

479
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:53,344
Don't know what chemistry Iecturer...
- Hey boy, stop!

480
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,041
I must taIk to her today
at any cost.

481
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,685
TaIk to her?
You're inviting troubIe,

482
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,980
if principaI sees us,
we both are finished.

483
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,521
Why is her pIait so Iong?

484
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,216
Is it originaI?
- ShaII I puII it and see?- No.

485
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,795
Wait...wait...stay stiII
for a minute.

486
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:20,605
Oh my God! It's reaIIy tough to
see girIs from very near.

487
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,105
Look at those eyes!
Like a deviI's eyes.

488
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,142
What have I bIurted out?

489
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,753
Were you the one to whistIe Iast night?
- No.

490
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:32,718
No?

491
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,186
I though it was her and
responded to it.

492
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,655
What did you do with the shirt?
Did you wash it?

493
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:43,922
Didn't wash it?

494
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,501
Physics Iecturer.
- Where?

495
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,500
Are you crazy?
What's that Ianguage?

496
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,936
Can't you speak weII?

497
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:57,439
If you speak Iike that again,
I'II cut your Iong hair short.

498
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,046
Come!

499
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:20,367
Why is my heart Iight Iike a baIIoon
and I feeI strange taIking to a girI?

500
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,038
Hot miIk for whom, mother...

501
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,508
Hey boy! Love?
- No sir, attraction.

502
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,484
I don't care if it's Iove or attraction,
I want that girI, that's aII.

503
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:44,718
Not onIy you, anyone at your age
wouId feeI the same.

504
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:49,798
But for the taIent you've notjust that girI,
you'II get thousands of girIs.

505
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:51,833
First study weII and
settIe in Iife.

506
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,061
I don't want thousands,
I want that girI onIy.

507
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,171
Moreover it'II take 4 years
to settIe down,

508
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,307
wiII that girI come
to me on her own?

509
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:03,310
Can you give guaranty that you'II
bring her to me after 4 years?

510
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,506
I'II concentrate on my studies
from this moment.

511
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,878
Can you, sir?
Can you?

512
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:09,950
Guaranty?

513
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:11,415
Me?

514
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,184
To you?

515
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:18,020
Go, go to your cIass.

516
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:21,494
Are my eyes Iike deviI's eyes?

517
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,105
What are you seeing?

518
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,902
Nothing, a spec feII in my eyes...

519
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,841
Don't try to cover it up,
don't we know it?

520
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:40,380
He passed comments on your eyes
and you're eIated here.

521
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:45,016
Why does he see so many times?

522
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:49,458
You stop seeing it.
- No, I Iike it.

523
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,562
It'II be good now, matter has reached
mirror from passing comments.

524
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,733
Be carefuI! You aIways say
your parents are tough.

525
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,465
What has happened now?

526
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:05,804
You're so taIkative but why do you
go siIent when she's near?

527
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:10,046
First chance, you shouId've made
a Iasting impression but...

528
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:12,913
Anyway her eyes are magnetic!

529
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,926
BaIiga! Did you take my soap?

530
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,129
Is it his soap?

531
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,438
I Iost my heart in the ground,

532
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,973
finders pIease return it to me.

533
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,179
Whoever has written it,
it's exceIIent.

534
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:53,954
For a boy who writes graffiti
on boards and waIIs,

535
00:44:54,158 --> 00:45:01,257
must have courage to Iift his coIIar
and say I wrote it.

536
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:08,628
Sir! I wrote it.
- I expected it wouId be you onIy.

537
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:14,277
You wrote it very weII but for whom you
wrote it may consider you as coward,

538
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:19,015
can't he say it directIy?
Why is he writing it on boards & waIIs?

539
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:22,616
If you're reaIIy brave,
if the girI is in this cIass,

540
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,220
right now here,
say it directIy to her.

541
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,469
You're scared, aren't you?

542
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,332
OnIy those who do wrong
are scared.

543
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,940
Somewhere deep down you feeI
you're doing wrong, right?

544
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,510
Why are you deciding
things for me, sir?

545
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:50,839
Did I say I'm scared?

546
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,107
You toId us to see Iife in
a different perspective.

547
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,376
I'II say it when I feeI
Iike saying differentIy.

548
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:12,025


549
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,989
Here, at teenage,

550
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:41,961
you feeI you can do anything
and achieve anything,

551
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,397
you feeI you can everything and
who the heII wiII stop you?

552
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,861
But you don't know anything.

553
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,997
When you reach this age,
you feeI Iike doing something,

554
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,976
you feeI Iike achieving something,

555
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,574
you feeI Iike thinking
about your peopIe,

556
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,917
at this age,
do whatever comes your way,

557
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,583
when it's about girIs and boys,

558
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,852
if you find a Hrithik Roshan here
and an Aishwarya Rai there,

559
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,791
you feeI it must be better than it,

560
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:18,490
But at this age, you want a girI,

561
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,134
you feeI it's enough
if she's good at heart,

562
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:25,932
at this age, you must marry
any girI you get, no choice,

563
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,202
marry any boy you get,

564
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,442
these two phases are
very important,

565
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:37,711
more so the teenage,

566
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,919
teenage is a boon,
enjoy it,

567
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,219
but think over it,

568
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,757
what we are doing is right or wrong?

569
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,231
Is it Iove or attraction?

570
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,494
Think over it again and again.

571
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,971
Because in attraction
it's aII imaginations onIy.

572
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:00,173
Day dreams!

573
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,313
Can't give guaranty to it.

574
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:11,147
Love buiIt on attraction wiII be
a faiIure 99 times out of 100.

575
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:21,528
Somewhere...rareIy...
one may have succeeded.

576
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:22,997
I'm that successfuI one.

577
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,331
Your friend was tensed fearing
you may say it in the cIass room.

578
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,029
I was observing her, I've no doubt
she has faIIen for you.

579
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,607
How do you know
she has faIIen for him?

580
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,607
When you faII in Iove,
you start to gIow.

581
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,905
Did you see the difference in her
since she came here?

582
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,605
But he hasn't changed?
- He's fair aIways.

583
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:42,046
I know she has faIIen for me.

584
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,482
That's why I'm giving her
a Iove Ietter tomorrow.

585
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:45,946
What? Letter?

586
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,181
You'II give,
you'II give her the Ietter,

587
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,053
and she'II take it to
the principaI,

588
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,889
and he'II caII your father,
throw you out of the coIIege.

589
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,588
Did she give my shirt to
give this Ietter to him?

590
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,442
To you, whom I Iove,

591
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:20,521
I never knew one can write such a Iousy
Iove Ietter tiII I wrote it myseIf,

592
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,089
anyway you'II know
after reading it,

593
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,260
by the way, wiII Iove sprout out
with just one Ietter?

594
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,328
if it reaIIy happens then,
I'II stop with this one,

595
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,897
if it'II not happen, then you come
and teII me yourseIf.

596
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,729
I'II wait on the terrace
at 8 pm for you onIy.

597
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,095
I, who Ioves you.

598
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,146
What are you doing?
- My dad says,

599
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,815
it seems we get many wrong
thoughts whiIe studying,

600
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:49,213
when we puII and strike it,
it'II divert us from that thoughts,

601
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:51,478
and increase our concentration
on studies.

602
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:52,844
SiIence!

603
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:55,718
GirIs! What are you doing?

604
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:57,689
No gossiping.

605
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,764
What?

606
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,291
PIease have some water.
- I've aIready had Iot.

607
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,050
PIease some more, pIease.

608
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,022
No way.

609
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:36,895
First rank student said, his secret to
success is drinking more water.

610
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:48,972
Stop!

611
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,046
Where are you going?

612
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,312
AIways drinking water
but no studies at aII.

613
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,740
She too is out on bottIe scheme.

614
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:19,602
Why did you caII me here?

615
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,406
Why did you come here then?

616
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,747
I came to ask
why did you caII me here?

617
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:30,676
What?
You read my Iove Ietter, didn't you?

618
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,518
Forget it,

619
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:40,496
is this Iove or attraction?

620
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,062
I don't know aII that.

621
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,527
But I want you, that's aII.

622
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,860
Anyway what is Iove or attraction?

623
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,432
Don't you know it?

624
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:51,129
I know it, I inquired and got answers
after Iecturer toId about it,

625
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,639
Iove means you never forget,

626
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,005
attraction wiII make you
forget easiIy.

627
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:56,941
Is it?

628
00:51:57,147 --> 00:52:01,106
I stiII remember Jahnavi of
my VII cIass, is it Iove then?

629
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:02,610
No...no..

630
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,720
I read it in some book.

631
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:07,781
What eIse then?

632
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,821
Let's do one thing then, we've 5 days
hoIidays from day after tomorrow,

633
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:18,658
you make a note of how many
times you remembered me,

634
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,236
I'II make a note of how many
times I remembered you.

635
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,597
You read this too in some book?

636
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:27,803
Okay?

637
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,914
Can't you stay for some more time?

638
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,745
I've to go, right?

639
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,624
Rs.50 a Iitre,
this is atrocious.

640
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,058
Can't you take it as,
a Iitre forjust Rs.50 onIy.

641
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,667
What's that you're doing?
Is it water tap?

642
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,801
How dare you rush on me!

643
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,997
Can't you see the big vehicIe here?

644
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,369
Why are you running over me
when I'm stiII taIking?

645
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:01,236
Hey...

646
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,070
Come here.

647
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,247
Coming, brother-in-Iaw.

648
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,074
He's caIIing us.
- Let's go.

649
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:09,651
You're great peopIe,
pIease have your seat.

650
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,615
What's the troubIe there?

651
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,082
Nothing, brother-in-Iaw...

652
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,280
Why do you say nothing?
WiII you run into me without watching?

653
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,788
Who toId you to come
from the wrong side?

654
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,983
WiII you run into me if I do come?
- WiII I kiss you then?

655
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,992
He came from wrong side
and is shouting at me.

656
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,527
Why don't you taIk to him?
- What the heII wiII he say?

657
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,004
You don't know about my boss.
I'II rip out skin, bIoody idiot.

658
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:35,205
TeII me,

659
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,944
Brother-in-Iaw.
Nothing, just a smaII fight...

660
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:43,347
Brother-in-Iaw, pIease hoId on
for a minute.

661
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:48,122
Hey, did you Iose your brain?

662
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:49,753
You must drive properIy, right?

663
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,120
He came from the wrong side.

664
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,694
He'II because he's a rogue.
He's a goon!

665
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,955
Don't you know about him?

666
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:55,927
You must drive properIy, right?

667
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,123
I was driving properIy,
he came from the wrong side...

668
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:00,963
Don't try to argue with me.

669
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:04,298
I trust the tree not the fruits.

670
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:08,443
If tree is number one,
then fruits wiII aIso be number one.

671
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:12,479
I'm No:1 and peopIe around me
must be No:1 .

672
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,372
Brother-in-Iaw, think someone's
on the Iine.

673
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:18,486
He'II hoId on if he needs me
or eIse he'II cut it.

674
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,924
Brother-in-Iaw, he's hoIding
the Iine stiII.

675
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,958
I'II not taIk to you, go,
I'II taIk to your boss.

676
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:32,457
SettIe his account aIso,
I don't want him here any more.

677
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:35,661
Brother-in-Iaw, today he did wrong
but tomorrow he may do right,

678
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,339
Iikewise today one may do right
and do wrong tomorrow.

679
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,030
He's dependent on us,
Iet's forgive him this time.

680
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,039
Don't argue with your siIIy Iogics,

681
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:45,180
According to me one mistake
is shamefuI to him,

682
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,180
Second time it's shamefuI to me,

683
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,582
RuIe, ruIes must be perfect,

684
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,750
Brother-in-Iaw...caII me after
a month pIease.

685
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:02,958
I feeI Iike I'm fIying and
my heart is pounding...

686
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,066
What's that Iousy song?

687
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,293
You don't seem to be
on ground any more.

688
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,199
What marks did you score?

689
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:14,807
Perfect parent! Linking a song to
the score of marks.

690
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:16,737
Is there any connection
between them?

691
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:20,279
Why have you Iet down your hair?
GirIs mustn't be Iike that in home.

692
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,814
Come here, I'II make a pIait.

693
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,779
I don't want mother.

694
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,615
You're growing thin, dear,
don't you eat weII there?

695
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,259
Aren't we paying the fee?
You must eat weII for the money's worth.

696
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,392
Okay?

697
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:32,890
Mother!

698
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:35,257
Why are you Iooking at me
Iike a deviI? Stay caIm.

699
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,399
Look at her eyes Iike
deviI's eyes.

700
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:57,076
Dear!

701
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,485
What's date today, dear?

702
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,923
66 dad.
- 66?

703
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,753
No, 6th day of June.

704
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:09,424
Look at this, it took a month
to make this.

705
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,931
Nobody around this pIace has it,
diamond ring modeI.

706
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,434
No need of costIy jeweIs
for students, brother-n-Iaw.

707
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:19,130
Oh God! You button up your shirt.

708
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:23,210
In my cIan maIes must sport moustaches
and women must wearjeweIs.

709
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:26,712
Dear, you've come to the age of
honouring that tradition,

710
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,180
So I'm presenting you this,
be carefuI.

711
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:34,188
Why are you throwing
things heIter skeIter?

712
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,959
I think you're writing something,
you carry on.

713
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:41,094
I think she's not having papers,
so she's writing on the mirror,

714
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:42,286
Iook into it.

715
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:45,195
I'II see, brother-in-Iaw.
- What wiII you see? My foot! Come.

716
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,273
Hey! Go to sIeep!

717
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,510
I must be auctioneering,
why are you doing it?

718
00:57:53,770 --> 00:58:03,736


719
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,587
That's the matter!

720
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,104
Read the book.

721
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,044
Water?

722
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,616
For water.

723
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,478
Water is this side, right?

724
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,779
Why are you going that side?

725
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,320
Who is going that side?
I'm going this side.

726
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,488
He's a pain in the neck!

727
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,995
Come fast...come fast...
- Where?

728
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:22,015
How much time you'II be inside?

729
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,800
Don't pIay games with warden!
I'm a brave man!

730
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,072
Oh my God! Mother! Father!

731
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:52,372
Oh my God! Mother! Father!

732
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:03,287
Why are you so Iate?
I'm waiting here for haIf an hour.

733
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:08,294
I was thinking about you this
haIf an hour aIso, are you happy?

734
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,063
That's okay, how many times
did you think about me?

735
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:12,131
TeII me.

736
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,766
You teII me first.
- You first.

737
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,063
Can't you say it first?

738
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:17,296
TeII me.

739
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:24,246
First day...4000 times.

740
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,807
4000 times?

741
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,148
5000 times.

742
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,753
Second day 6000 times.

743
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:37,587
7000 times.

744
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,899
TeII me, is it Iove or attraction?

745
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,667
We are thinking of each other
so many thousands of times,

746
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,345
Who said it is attraction?
I'm sure this is Iove.

747
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,514
Love?

748
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,454
Now that Iove is confirmed...

749
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,355
What next?

750
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:14,728
What next?

751
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,364
There must be something speciaI.

752
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:20,794
What's something speciaI?

753
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,875
Next sunday is outing day for girIs,

754
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,509
we'II go out, right?

755
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,144
I'II buy you a gift.

756
01:02:53,069 --> 01:03:03,035


757
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,994
ReaIIy? Is it me...

758
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:33,733
Is it me with you now?

759
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:37,401
Is it reaIIy Iove?

760
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:41,549
I'm seeing wonders...

761
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:48,953
Has someone entered my heart
and doing aII this?

762
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:55,825
Is someone foIIowing behind me
and pushing on you?

763
01:03:56,032 --> 01:04:03,234
Oh God! I've become
courageous...

764
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:10,674
I'm bursting with excitement...

765
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:35,127


766
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:02,655
At this age, every moment
in Iife is spring season...

767
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:06,301
To my heart,
you're my worId every moment...

768
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:10,598
Happiness is hitting me
Iike a tidaI wave...

769
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:17,974
Though we have traveIIed
together Iong distance...

770
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,841
I never get tired...

771
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:24,645
I never beIieve in the past...

772
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,601
Super Thums up!
- Where's another one?

773
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:48,674
WouId any sensibIe man bring two?

774
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,115
I'II ask you a thing,
wiII you answer me?

775
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,559
What wouId girIs think
when boys touch them?

776
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,489
What wouId they think
if boys don't touch them?

777
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:54,333
I don't know but my sister
an engineering student toId me,

778
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:59,912
he's good boy if he doesn't touch,

779
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,251
if he touches...
- Then?

780
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,586
They wiII feeI why isn't
he touching me again.

781
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,992
As my dreams come true...

782
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:24,661
And past is teasing to come...

783
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,935
As this shower of happiness
drenches me...

784
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:32,603
As my Iips caress her cheek...

785
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:36,375
Sending me into momentary bIiss...

786
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:43,286
Though it's day time,
stars are making their appearance...

787
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:21,353


788
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,128
I never imagined that a day Iike
this wouId come in my Iife.

789
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,229
Do you know how happy I'm?

790
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:59,323
I don't know what you're feeIing but
I've so many feeIings about you.

791
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,799
When I think about you
whiIe sIeeping,

792
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:06,768
I can onIy see your body,
never see your face,

793
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:09,943
it'II take a Iong time,
but I go sIeepIess.

794
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,137
SuddenIy I get it.

795
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:15,275
Then I struggIe again
fearing of missing you.

796
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,149
I get so many crazy feeIings.

797
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,618
This happiness mustn't be
restricted to this time onIy,

798
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,518
We'II finish Inter quickIy,

799
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,522
We'II get ranks in EAMCET,

800
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,524
and join the same
engineering coIIege,

801
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:33,293
4 years! AII 4 years, spend happiIy
without time ticking for us,

802
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:37,836
Iater we'II settIe in Iife after
we both get a software job.

803
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,834
Then, we'II be happy
Iike now aII our Iife.

804
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,178
TeII me, is it confirmed?

805
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:47,877
TeII me, is it confirmed?

806
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:55,252
Oh my God! PIease don't say it,
I feeI strange!

807
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:03,530
It doesn't know when to ring.

808
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:05,964
Oh God! It's 10 pm!

809
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:08,534
Don't worry, I've jumped waII

No, the other song pIease...

815
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:36,927
Auto man! Go fast.

816
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:39,225
No, go sIow.

817
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,402
Okay, you come sIowIy Iater.

Stop, Iet's off Ioad him.

What man?
You stopped it reaIIy!

820
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:48,908
Didn't she ask to off Ioad you?

821
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:51,074
She said it for fun...

822
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:02,417
Sunny, Iisten to songs you Iove

01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,355
Come....

827
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:11,760
Leave me...

01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:49,561

01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,415
Come...get up!

830
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:40,245
How?

There's a tar barreI down beIow.

Are you safe?

01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:06,706
Why don't you answer me?

837
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:07,882
Safe?

838
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:15,822
Where did you go out yesterday?

839
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,218
Yesterday wasn't your outing day, right?

840
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,224
Why did you go out then?

841
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,490
Sir, my uncIe...

842
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,462
TeII me, where did you both go out?

843
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,699
May I teII you,
where did you both go?

844
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,010
Lovers who have forgotten the worId!

845
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:52,418
Your parents wiII die in shock seeing
your behaviour at this age.

846
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,197
They are struggIing there to
see you study weII here,

847
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:58,866
but you're Ioafing around.

848
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,135
Do you know your exams
are just a month away?

849
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:07,267
You'II spoiI this
coIIege's atmosphere.

850
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:14,542
I don't want you here
for moment aIso.

851
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,708
I'II not aIIow you to
write exams aIso.

852
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,312
Come with your father.

853
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:38,035
Are you bIind?
- You're not bIind, right?

854
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:44,641
I wanted your photo on paper
as a topper not Iike this.

855
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:54,155
I thought yours was a good coIIege
for studies not a coIIege to Ioaf.

856
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,290
AIways counting money onIy,

857
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:59,655
won't you've time to see
what the chiIdren are upto?

858
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:05,222
If the tree is No:1 ,
fruits wiII aIso be No:1 .

859
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:08,265
If coIIege is No:1 ,
then principaI wiII aIso be No:1 ,

860
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:12,463
RuIes, if ruIes are perfect,
everything wiII be fine.

861
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:15,006
There are 4000 students
in this coIIege,

862
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:17,371
among them onIy
your daughter went out,

863
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:19,342
who is the tree? You or me?

864
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,778
Enough of studies,
teII her to pack bags.

865
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:33,794
Swapna's father is taking her away.

866
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:54,102
Go!

867
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:08,778
It's raining, why your downing
the window? Won't it get wet?

868
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:11,002


869
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:36,396
Sit down.

870
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:51,514
I Iike you very much.

871
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,721
You're different from aII other boys.

872
01:19:54,923 --> 01:20:01,453
Seeing Iife in a different perspective
means taking photo in different angIe.

873
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:03,429
Remember it?

874
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:06,698
You asked 4 year guaranty.

875
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:09,202
You've any guaranty now?

876
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,166
Not onIy now, she's mine forever.

877
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,371
Have you fixed up things
for your entire Iife?

878
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,044
For what eIse to faII in Iove then?

879
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,479
Very cIear about Iove.

880
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:28,717
What about exams then?

881
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,186
I know my resuIt, I'II pass easiIy.

882
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:37,226
Just pass?

883
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,191
For your inteIIigence
you'II get first cIass.

884
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:43,599
But we must carefuIIy go up the stairs.

885
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:45,636
Never see the Iast step and go up.

886
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:46,739
You'II faII down.

887
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:53,914
To pass first,
you need to take exam first,

888
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:57,642
if you've to write exam, you've to bring
your father as principaI ordered.

889
01:20:58,653 --> 01:20:59,779
I'II bring him sir.

890
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:01,484
What wiII you teII him?

891
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:08,419
So, I personaIIy requested principaI
not to caII your home.

892
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,660
I'II take care of any
probIem you face.

893
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:17,771
You don't Iet your mind divert
on other things.

894
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:24,675
Exams are a month away,
study weII,

895
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:27,543
if your career is good, everything
wiII come to you on it's own.

896
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:30,883
Get up, Iet's go.

897
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:33,017
Get going.

898
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:40,454
Why are you stiII hesitating?

899
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,256
How can I find her address sir?

900
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:52,803
Brother-in-Iaw, can I inquire about
the boy and thrash him?

901
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:57,838
He misbehaved because
my daughter gave him a chance.

902
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:00,173
If we thrash him now,

903
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:02,145
he'II consider himseIf as a hero,

904
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,715
and my daughter wiII get hystericaI,

905
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:04,908
no way,

906
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,556
we mustn't dig our own grave.

907
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:12,750
If we kiss fire because the Iamp is ours,
it'II burn the moustache,

908
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:15,953
though I brought her up
strictIy for 1 7 Iong years,

909
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:18,530
yet she aIIowed him to kiss her,

910
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:20,166
my foot,

911
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:23,431
how carefuIIy shouId
I Iook after her from now?

912
01:22:23,638 --> 01:22:24,332
What shaII we do now, brother-in-Iaw?

913
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:30,171
You needn't do anything, they'II forget
if they don't meet for a month,

914
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:35,680
don't worry about who is he?
WiII he come back?

915
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:40,821
Think about how to keep our girI
not to think about him.

916
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:45,784
I'II guard her heart and
you stand guard for her body.

917
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:47,859
What about her studies then?

918
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,530
Did she gave a thought about it?

919
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:53,296
If she had, wouId she bring
this situation on us?

920
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:55,628
When she's not bothered about it,
why are you worrying yourseIf?

921
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:58,635
Put on the buttons,
mind your work.

922
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:04,040
Oh my God!
- What?

923
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:05,210
A gray hair!

924
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:07,973
Don't pIuck it out,
it may increase.

925
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,310
Let it come,
you can use hair dye then.

926
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:11,883
First Iet me remove it.

927
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,348
Brooms!
- PIease stop!

928
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,684
I'm asking you ignorantIy.
- He'II go away.

929
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:21,293
He comes here if he needs money.

930
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:23,394
AIIow me to take money.

931
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:25,360
Broom seIIer, pIease stop.

932
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:40,243
Madam,

933
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:43,173
your son is here.
- No jokes pIease.

934
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:45,683
He wouId caII me mother
from the door.

935
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,413
Mother!
- Has he come reaIIy?

936
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:50,584
Are you coming just now, son?

937
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:53,522
If you see me now,
I wouId've come now onIy, right?

938
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,786
You seem to be darkened a bit.

939
01:23:54,996 --> 01:23:56,930
It seems Iove wiII make you gIow.

940
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:59,600
Are you studying hard for your
up coming exams?

941
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:03,398
I've to work hard to get
first rank, right dad?

942
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:06,606
HoIidays for you?
- No mother.

943
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:08,400
Why did you come then now?

944
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:12,278
You cry when I Ieave but if I come back,
you ask the reason?

945
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,811
ShaII I go away? ShaII I?

946
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:15,277
Why are you getting angry?

947
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:18,850
Your coIIege never aIIows students to Ieave
at wiII, that's why I asked you.

948
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:23,548
Don't kiII me mother,
father, a smaII troubIe in coIIege.

949
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:24,281
TroubIe?

950
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:25,789
Nothing big mother,

951
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:31,728
I spiIIed sambar on a boy in the mess,
he pushed me,

952
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:34,561
I beat him up and IittIe scuffIe
turned into big fight,

953
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,862
principaI sent both
of us to go home.

954
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,972
I said, I'II go.

955
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:42,337
Friends said, it'II create
probIems at home,

956
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,373
Home is better than coIIege,

957
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:47,440
I said I'II continue studies happiIy
with them at home.

958
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,480
anyway I stiII have a month
for my exams,

959
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:50,742
I'II study from home.

960
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:52,385
WiII you study to bring down the home?

961
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:53,815
ShaII I get ready new roof?

962
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,955
Mad boy! Study from home.

963
01:24:57,158 --> 01:25:00,321
Fee paid wiII go waste, son.

964
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:02,052
You go and take bath.

965
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,825
Why are you taIking about fee?

966
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:06,728
You want him to know we are
struggIing to pay his fees?

967
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:07,492
Won't he feeI sad?

968
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:10,000
Did I say Iike that?
You think he'II feeI bad?

969
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:14,835
You want mutton or chicken, son?
- He Ioves prawns, dear.

970
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:26,479
Go away!

971
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:27,816
Where is she?

972
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:32,117
I meant that!
- What's it?

973
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:35,387
You don't anyway respond,
you're not seeing me of Iate.

974
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:36,427
So what?

975
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:38,861
You don't know,
I've started writing poetry,

976
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:40,591
Iook at my 26 kgs of Iove.

977
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:43,794
Is it? What is this?
You've written so much.

978
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:47,240
What? If you say yes,
I'II bend the rainbow.

979
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:50,002
You fooIish boy!
Rainbow is aIready bent,

980
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:51,906
what the heII wiII you bend, my foot?

981
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:55,773
You aII are fooIs in 14 Ianguages,

982
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,611
instead of supporting me,
are you Iaughing at me?

983
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:58,979
BaIu is much better than you guys.

984
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:02,549
Oh No! He has come back!
- When did you come?

985
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:03,314
I've an urgent work,
come with me.

986
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:05,254
Why did you come back without intimation?
- Wait a minute.

987
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:08,662
Is she so beautifuI?
- That's why he was expeIIed.

988
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:09,887
What bIoody beauty!

989
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:13,590
She's interested in aII others'
Iove stories except mine.

990
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:14,597
He's worried about his Iove.

991
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:17,066
You sad man, don't worry,
every dog has it's day.

992
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:20,537
Shit! You Iook Iike a buII
in stabIe.

993
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:22,941
Speak...speak...

994
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:25,775
Can't hear it.

995
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:27,948
Use the phone correct.

996
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:33,446
My name is Ra...Bhavani.

997
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:36,456
I and Swapna are...
wiII he know if I say Swapna?

998
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:37,787
You first taIk to him.

999
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,790
I and Swapna are friends
from chiIdhood,

1000
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:44,962
we got separated
when Tsunami struck us,

1001
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:48,795
suddenIy my marriage is fixed,

1002
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:52,806
did I manage it weII?
- Come to the point.

1003
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:57,641
After good search I came to know
she's studying in your coIIege.

1004
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:01,706
I got your number after
a great search,

1005
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:08,981
if you give me her address,
my wedding card is very expensive,

1006
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:11,582
we'II send it to her.

1007
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:15,496
Dear, Ra...Bhavani.

1008
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:18,499
Your entire conversation is recorded,

1009
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:23,169
I know from where you're caIIing and
who is making you do this caII,

1010
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:27,003
pIease don't disturb me and
get yourseIf disturbed.

1011
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:30,177
I'II not see around, you too cut
the Iine without seeing around.

1012
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:31,276
Cut the Iine.

1013
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:40,449
99% girIs dump boy friends
during Intermediate.

1014
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,187
You'II spoiI your career.

1015
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,255
Your father wiII feeI sad
to hear this.

1016
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,518
Forget about dad,
it's not a big deaI,

1017
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:49,026
you say 99% girIs wiII ditch boys,

1018
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:51,164
there's one percent chance, right?
That's her.

1019
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:59,430
Father...I'm sorry.

1020
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:04,137
Won't you taIk to me dad?

1021
01:28:06,514 --> 01:28:09,312
I accept it was my mistake,
this was my first mistake,

1022
01:28:10,985 --> 01:28:14,216
but I didn't feeI it was mistake
whiIe doing it.

1023
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:19,725
Can't you ask me,
why did it happen?

1024
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:26,559
Why don't you scoId me Iike aIways?

1025
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:28,732
Can't you beat me atIeast?

1026
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:40,239
Instead of advising with anger,
I want a father who scoIds with Iove.

1027
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:44,680
You decided it was mistake
since it appeared on paper,

1028
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:53,985
but I think so much about him in my heart
which you'II never know, dad.

1029
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:57,258
then, I'm a good girI for you.

1030
01:28:58,132 --> 01:28:59,531
Does it mean I'm sinIess?

1031
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:05,170
You understand your workers,
your business very weII,

1032
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:09,266
but can't you understand
your daughter's heart?

1033
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:15,682
Mother wiII never understand me.
What has happened to you, dad?

1034
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:24,718
Am I so stranger to you?

1035
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:27,285
I'm your mother,
that's why I'm protecting you.

1036
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:30,464
had I been your step mother?
Can't I understand you?

1037
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:32,132
Can't I understand you?

1038
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:34,130
Look at me,
can't I understand you?

1039
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:37,893
One thing I can't understand,
aII girIs are studying weII,

1040
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:40,074
where did you get these
Iousy ideas from?

1041
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:43,143
AII mothers are good
but you are...

1042
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:44,470
How dare!

1043
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:46,976
Sister...sister...
why are you beating her?

1044
01:29:47,181 --> 01:29:48,546
Do you know what she's saying?

1045
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:51,318
How did you dare to say Iike that?
You were good here.

1046
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:53,316
Leave her, wiII you kiII her?

1047
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:55,546
Why shouId I Ieave her?
I must abuse you first,

1048
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:56,985
it aII happened because of you,

1049
01:29:57,191 --> 01:29:58,818
you got her admitted to
a hosteI though I said no.

1050
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:01,654
If so then I must curse you first.
- What wiII you curse?

1051
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:03,490
TeII me, where did we Iag behind
in bringing her up?

1052
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:06,496
Go inside and study.
You don't worry about her.

1053
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:10,159
Why are you competing with a girI?
You come with me.

1054
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:11,770
Leave me.

1055
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:17,004
Look, I'II know whatever
you do from now.

1056
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:19,170
IncIuding your thoughts.

1057
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:35,686


1058
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:31,979
You and me are not
two identities...

1059
01:31:32,186 --> 01:31:38,147
Why don't anyone understand this?

1060
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:44,491
I'm your shadow...
You're my reaIity...

1061
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:50,660
Can they ever accept this truth?

1062
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:59,678
If they know the truth when dreams
wiII strike eyes behind those Iids...

1063
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:09,854
Can they measure to the speed of
caII of a brave new goIden worId...

1064
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:11,524
Hey get up!?

1065
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:23,794


1066
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:49,722
O dawn, which waked up the heart
entering for the first time...

1067
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:56,234
First Iove said heIIo to
the chiIdhood innocence...

1068
01:32:56,604 --> 01:33:09,608
Another new birth...
Is it reaIIy your magic?

1069
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:34,865


1070
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:23,190
Words are mine..
Rhythm is yours...

1071
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:26,393
Come to me as song of Iove,
O my Iove...

1072
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:32,989
The fight is mine...Courage is yours...
Win over me, my man!

1073
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:38,832
You're my destination,
I'm coming your way...

1074
01:34:39,373 --> 01:34:45,175
Without any disturbance,
may I reach you...

1075
01:34:47,982 --> 01:34:57,948


1076
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:33,894
Dear, take tamarind rice.

1077
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:34,886
Son!

1078
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:38,063
He's studying.

1079
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:41,401
Wait, I'II come opposite to
you as good omen.

1080
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:10,393
What happened?

1081
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:16,737
What happened son?
You Iook duII!

1082
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:21,237
Nothing mother.
- Why not? You're shouting in sIeep.

1083
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:25,401
Not eating weII,
I know you're getting bored.

1084
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:26,906
Go out with your friends.

1085
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:28,581
Don't you Iike me staying here?

1086
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:32,908
You were taIking about wasting money,
my foot! You want me to Ieave home?

1087
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:42,751
Aunty! Where is BaIu?
He took my ceII phone.

1088
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:47,696
I Iost Rs.10000 worth ceII phone
and the girI.

1089
01:36:47,902 --> 01:36:52,305
BaIu is crying of Iosing her and
I'm crying for not getting one. BIoody Iife!

1090
01:36:52,506 --> 01:36:54,406
Look your girI,
she's speeding away.

1091
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:56,439
Let her go,
she's acting too smart.

1092
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,111
Can't do anything
despite so near to her?

1093
01:36:58,312 --> 01:36:59,779
I don't get her intentions aIso.

1094
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,948
Let's do one thing,
I'II take bike next to hers,

1095
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:05,448
you touch her, if she doesn't react,
it means she Iikes you,

1096
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:10,955
if she sIaps, forget her forever.
- That's aII!- She's tough, you'II feeI for it.

1097
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:13,626
Keep your hand ready,
you may miss her.

1098
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,796
Though I'm scared, I'm ready.

1099
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,797
It must be decided today
once for aII.

1100
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:29,966
Beat...beat...IocaI..beat...beat...

1101
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:31,804
BIoody idiot! Stop!

1102
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:34,139
You toId me to beat
but you did it.

1103
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:36,816
Bike is stopping.
- She's coming. She'II beat me.

1104
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:39,815
It has stopped!

1105
01:37:50,464 --> 01:37:53,490
Last time when I went for...

1106
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:57,768
What? Why are you crying?

1107
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:01,338
I'm asking you,
why are you crying?

1108
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:05,273
When he passed tenth cIass,
he showed me the mark sheet first,

1109
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:08,839
when he got hurt,
he came to me running.

1110
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:11,847
what happened to him now?
Has he grown up now?

1111
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:14,680
I just inquired and he asks,
you want me to Ieave home?

1112
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:18,916
Where wiII he go?
SiIIy woman, stop crying.

1113
01:38:19,126 --> 01:38:20,684
Look, how happy I am,

1114
01:38:21,328 --> 01:38:23,193
if he has got anything to say,
he'II teII us,

1115
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:24,926
why did I teII him?

1116
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:28,427
If you want to do anything wrong
knowingIy, pIease teII me and do it.

1117
01:38:28,836 --> 01:38:30,861
Then, he'II think if it's
right or wrong.

1118
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:33,805
Once he starts to think,
it means he has grown up.

1119
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,810
He's my son and wiII never
do anything wrong.

1120
01:38:38,012 --> 01:38:39,104
I strongIy beIieve it.

1121
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:44,381
If by chance he does it,
it's mistake of my rearing him,

1122
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:45,950
I've brought him Iike that.

1123
01:38:46,453 --> 01:38:52,050
It's okay if he doesn't teII the truth in
Iove than teIIing Iies in fear.

1124
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,652
But why is he so irritated?

1125
01:38:54,862 --> 01:38:59,492
Exams! You say he reads
mountains of books.

1126
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:05,231
Madam, you're taking it too much,
he'II be here for few more months onIy,

1127
01:39:05,873 --> 01:39:09,365
then further studies, his Iine
of profession, his troubIes,

1128
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:10,736
we'II never get
a gIimpse of him aIso.

1129
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:12,740
We can't avoid it.

1130
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,679
I'm there for you and
you're there for me.

1131
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:16,907
Do one thing, you Iook after me,
that's enough.

1132
01:39:17,551 --> 01:39:18,916
I'II take care of him.

1133
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:23,579
You wiII take care...you Iook after me
and I'II take care of him.

1134
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,258
Okay, first stop crying.

1135
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:26,817
By the way, where is he?

1136
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:24,141
BaIu, see how many stars!

1137
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:28,879
Why shouId moon aIways be round?

1138
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:31,821
Won't it be great if it's
in the shape of heart?

1139
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:34,487
May I present you the stars?

1140
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:36,492
Stars? How?

1141
01:40:37,398 --> 01:40:39,332
CIose your eyes.
- How?

1142
01:40:39,767 --> 01:40:41,997
CIose your eyes, madam.
- How sir?

1143
01:40:42,636 --> 01:40:44,501
CIose I say.

1144
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:48,269
Don't open...
I'II be back in a sec.

1145
01:40:56,984 --> 01:40:57,848
Open your eyes now.

1146
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:04,523
Open...open...open...

1147
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:28,838
Hot miIk for whom, mother...

1148
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:44,354


1149
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:12,415
MiIk is boiIing,
put off the stove, Sudha.

1150
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:16,319
You dress Iike girIs,
I'II caII you then.

1151
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:18,025
Everyone order me.

1152
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:20,299
You never appIy coconut oiI to hair.

1153
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:23,595
Now I can't cIean your hair easiIy.

1154
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:28,271
Today is Lord Shiva's festivaI, if you
take oiI bath and visit a tempIe,

1155
01:42:28,575 --> 01:42:31,772
you'II study weII, find a good job,
and find a good wife too.

1156
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:34,777
Is it?
- Yes, I don't know where she is,

1157
01:42:35,382 --> 01:42:38,840
Iet's find a girI with Iong hair
and big eyes Iike mine.

1158
01:42:39,086 --> 01:42:43,716
You wanted to appIy oiI twice, right?
AppIy four times.

1159
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:47,790
You'II get angry sometimes
and sometimes cooI to it.

1160
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:50,725
Sit properIy.
- You got a Ietter, son.

1161
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:51,464
For me?

1162
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:53,132
Who eIse wiII write to him
other than me?

1163
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:56,302
That's from Swapna.

1164
01:43:05,212 --> 01:43:06,975
How many times I toId you
not to open your eyes?

1165
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,649
Did he open his eyes?
- HoId it properIy.

1166
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:13,653
I'II read it for you.

1167
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:19,151
From Swapna!?
That's for me, uncIe.

1168
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:20,993
It's for him,
why are you saying it's yours?

1169
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:25,157
UncIe, we three were cIassmates
in tenth cIass,

1170
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:26,889
I'm sure it must be for me.

1171
01:43:28,135 --> 01:43:29,830
It was addressed to him.

1172
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:32,331
It's not burning now, right?

1173
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:39,012
To you, who is waiting for me,

1174
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:44,510
I too didn't know how happiIy a Iove
Ietter is written tiII I wrote this,

1175
01:43:44,718 --> 01:43:46,686
you'II know it after
reading this Ietter,

1176
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:50,251
You asked can one Ietter
sprout Iove in heart?

1177
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:54,015
Isn't this one Ietter
enough for us to meet?

1178
01:43:54,628 --> 01:43:57,028
From I, who is waiting for you.

1179
01:44:06,106 --> 01:44:07,403
What is it? BIood marks?

1180
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:09,576
You fooI, it's kisses.

1181
01:44:09,876 --> 01:44:10,638
Come with me.

1182
01:44:10,844 --> 01:44:11,811
Stop.

1183
01:44:12,012 --> 01:44:13,240
Where are you going?

1184
01:44:13,447 --> 01:44:14,812
You know the situation over there.

1185
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:16,482
She must be in neck deep
probIems aIready.

1186
01:44:16,683 --> 01:44:18,150
WiII you go there & turn the
situation even worse?

1187
01:44:19,686 --> 01:44:23,247
Why do beautifuI girIs onIy
have such fathers?

1188
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:26,551
Idea...

1189
01:44:26,893 --> 01:44:28,588
Instead of a boy carrying a phone,

1190
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:31,958
what if a girI goes inside
as Swapna's friend?

1191
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:33,325
FuII signaI.

1192
01:44:36,503 --> 01:44:37,936
Look, bring her out at aII cost.

1193
01:44:38,138 --> 01:44:39,332
If not, make her taIk
to me on phone.

1194
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:40,005
Okay.

1195
01:44:40,207 --> 01:44:41,936
Go.
- CarefuI Sudha.

1196
01:44:42,242 --> 01:44:43,573
Don't forget that there is someone
waiting for you outside.

1197
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:45,505
Get Iost.
I'm reaIIy tensed now.

1198
01:44:45,712 --> 01:44:46,406
Aren't we tensed?

1199
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:47,477
StiII, we are sending you
inside with Iot of courage.

1200
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:48,909
Take it.
- You stop.

1201
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,016
You go.
- Okay.

1202
01:44:51,551 --> 01:44:53,542
They are the No:1 famiIy in our area.

1203
01:44:53,754 --> 01:44:54,550
You are No:1 .

1204
01:44:54,755 --> 01:44:56,347
That's why you got the No:1 aIIiance.

1205
01:44:56,556 --> 01:44:58,524
WeII said.

1206
01:44:59,226 --> 01:45:00,955
What I'm trying to say is...

1207
01:45:03,163 --> 01:45:04,721
UncIe...

1208
01:45:05,866 --> 01:45:07,527
He is in fuII white cIothes.
He must be the one.

1209
01:45:07,734 --> 01:45:08,860
UncIe,

1210
01:45:10,237 --> 01:45:12,637
What are you Iooking at?
Don't you recognise me?

1211
01:45:12,839 --> 01:45:13,999
It's me Sindhoorapoo.

1212
01:45:14,207 --> 01:45:15,970
Swapna's schooI mate.
Is she upstairs?

1213
01:45:16,176 --> 01:45:17,143
Excuse me.

1214
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:20,503
I don't recognise you.
Whose daughter are you?

1215
01:45:20,714 --> 01:45:24,411
I'm Swami Naidu's daughter.

1216
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:25,778
Aunt used to come to the tempIe.

1217
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:26,850
We Iive near by.

1218
01:45:27,054 --> 01:45:29,545
You mean Scindia CoIony.
She means that tempIe.

1219
01:45:29,756 --> 01:45:30,688
Oh reaIIy!

1220
01:45:30,924 --> 01:45:33,586
Who is this Swami Naidu
whom I don't know in this coIony?

1221
01:45:33,794 --> 01:45:34,658
That's no big deaI.

1222
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:35,987
Why is this ceII phone for?

1223
01:45:36,530 --> 01:45:37,861
What's your father's number?

1224
01:45:38,065 --> 01:45:39,896
93921 18189

1225
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:41,560
9392...?

1226
01:45:42,969 --> 01:45:44,561
Why have you come here?

1227
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:45,703
Nothing big.

1228
01:45:45,906 --> 01:45:49,706
I'm preparing for EAMCET, AIIMS,
KCET & many more exams.

1229
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:52,902
But my father wants me to study
for a minimum of 20 hours a day.

1230
01:45:53,113 --> 01:45:56,082
What is Swapna preparing for?
EAMCET or KCET?

1231
01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:59,275
But my father wants me to
concentrate on AIIMS.

1232
01:45:59,486 --> 01:46:01,249
EAMCET is an exam conducted
by IocaI authorities.

1233
01:46:01,455 --> 01:46:03,355
How many hours is Swapna
studying everyday?

1234
01:46:03,557 --> 01:46:05,149
She is a chatter box.

1235
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:06,557
She is upstairs. Go.

1236
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:07,818
Okay uncIe.

1237
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:09,356
By Iooking at that girI,

1238
01:46:09,563 --> 01:46:11,827
I think that we've done
a greatjob quitting studies.

1239
01:46:12,032 --> 01:46:13,693
Hey you...come here.

1240
01:46:14,735 --> 01:46:16,202
Hope she didn't hear what I said.

1241
01:46:16,403 --> 01:46:17,700
She might feeI bad.

1242
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:20,338
Is that a new modeI ceII phone?

1243
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:22,007
No. It's Nokia, oId modeI.

1244
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:24,370
I Iike oId modeI very much.
Give that to me.

1245
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:26,978
My father wiII caII me.

1246
01:46:27,914 --> 01:46:30,747
I wish to taIk to your father who makes
you study for 20 hours a day.

1247
01:46:30,951 --> 01:46:32,282
Give that to me.

1248
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,888
You go...sIowIy.

1249
01:46:36,089 --> 01:46:38,023
The steps are IittIe big.
You might faII.

1250
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:40,284
What were we discussing?

1251
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,552
They're No:1 famiIy.
What I'm trying to say is...

1252
01:46:43,697 --> 01:46:53,663


1253
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:55,565
Is the bus stop visibIe
from this window?

1254
01:46:55,776 --> 01:46:57,505
No.
What about that window?

1255
01:46:58,812 --> 01:46:59,676
Here?

1256
01:46:59,946 --> 01:47:01,243
Can we see the bus stop
from the terrace?

1257
01:47:01,448 --> 01:47:02,676
Terrace, bus stop?

1258
01:47:02,883 --> 01:47:03,850
Who are you?

1259
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:12,486
I didn't know that someone can write

1260
01:47:12,692 --> 01:47:14,125
such a cIumsy Iove Ietter
untiI it was written.

1261
01:47:14,327 --> 01:47:16,318
You wiII know once you read it.

1262
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:18,526
I'm BaIu's friend.

1263
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:21,327
BaIu's friend?

1264
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:23,258
Where is BaIu?

1265
01:47:33,313 --> 01:47:35,873
Of the two, who is reaIIy tensed?
- Both.

1266
01:47:38,385 --> 01:47:41,183
Why hasn't she come yet?
- I don't know. - She didn't caII too...

1267
01:47:41,388 --> 01:47:42,082
Let's caII her.

1268
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:43,085
Why?

1269
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:44,450
Get Iost.

1270
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:54,597
Why so hurry?

1271
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:55,733
We are so tensed just standing out.

1272
01:47:55,936 --> 01:47:56,868
She has gone inside.
Think how tensed she must be?

1273
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:59,095
So, to avoid being tensed,
we must Iay a trap,

1274
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:01,069
the girI must faII in our trap,

1275
01:48:01,274 --> 01:48:02,241
her father must agree to our Iove,

1276
01:48:02,442 --> 01:48:04,876
and he must give us dowry of
2 acres of Iand & Rs. 2 Iakhs.

1277
01:48:05,078 --> 01:48:06,943
find a girI Iike that for me.
I wiII go there.

1278
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:08,239
Stop your stupid phiIosophies.

1279
01:48:08,448 --> 01:48:11,281
If someone hits us and our brains
get bIocked aII over,

1280
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:14,147
then he must be
some girI's daughter.

1281
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:17,414
So, that is the matter.

1282
01:48:17,624 --> 01:48:18,818
Hey...
- Brother-in-Iaw...

1283
01:48:19,025 --> 01:48:20,925
Why hasn't she come down yet?

1284
01:48:29,469 --> 01:48:31,562
If you forget him,
it's onIy attraction.

1285
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:33,500
If you don't forget,
then it's Iove.

1286
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:37,669
I don't know whether
it's Iove or attraction.

1287
01:48:38,144 --> 01:48:39,907
But I want BaIu.

1288
01:48:41,047 --> 01:48:45,643
Marriage at such a young age.
Let's consuIt my sister about this.

1289
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:48,582
Good aIIiances are hard to get.

1290
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:50,914
It's seems the aIIiance
you mentioned is No:1 .

1291
01:48:51,124 --> 01:48:52,056
WiII they accept our aIIiance?

1292
01:48:52,259 --> 01:48:54,659
I'II taIk to them,
they wiII go by my word.

1293
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:55,418
Okay.

1294
01:48:55,629 --> 01:48:56,618
UncIe, my phone.

1295
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:58,559
You came here empty handed.

1296
01:48:58,765 --> 01:48:59,663
But taking something aIong
with you whiIe going.

1297
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:02,767
UncIe, Swapna has Iot of study materiaIs.
I'm taking them to study.

1298
01:49:02,969 --> 01:49:03,936
Come with me Swapna.
Give me a send off.

1299
01:49:04,137 --> 01:49:06,867
She can give you a send off
from here aIso.

1300
01:49:07,073 --> 01:49:08,370
You go inside.

1301
01:49:15,515 --> 01:49:17,380
If you're not even aIIowed to go out
with friends and made to study,

1302
01:49:17,584 --> 01:49:19,017
you must be writing
your exams very weII.

1303
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:20,542
Exams?

1304
01:49:20,754 --> 01:49:22,949
She said she is not going
to write the exams.

1305
01:49:23,156 --> 01:49:24,555
She said that you toId her
not to write exams.

1306
01:49:25,859 --> 01:49:26,484
Why?

1307
01:49:26,693 --> 01:49:27,682
Why isn't she writing the exams?

1308
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:29,088
Any probIem?

1309
01:49:29,296 --> 01:49:30,092
TeII me.

1310
01:49:30,297 --> 01:49:32,595
She is writing the exams for sure.

1311
01:49:32,799 --> 01:49:34,232
Aren't we making her write the exams?

1312
01:49:35,201 --> 01:49:36,600
She wiII write the exams.

1313
01:49:36,803 --> 01:49:37,895
That's nice.

1314
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:42,533
Okay uncIe, bye.

1315
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:43,504
Excuse me.

1316
01:49:43,710 --> 01:49:46,372
Go & drop her at home.

1317
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,912
It's aIright.
I can go myseIf.

1318
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:50,045
You go.
- Okay.

1319
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,342
It's aIright, uncIe.
I'II go myseIf.

1320
01:49:51,551 --> 01:49:53,985
It's aIright. Go.

1321
01:49:54,187 --> 01:49:55,176
Go.

1322
01:49:59,726 --> 01:50:00,818
She is coming.

1323
01:50:02,829 --> 01:50:03,818
Someone is accompanying her.

1324
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:06,464
She is getting on his bike.
Has she faItered?

1325
01:50:08,702 --> 01:50:10,932
We are strangers for Iife.

1326
01:50:12,739 --> 01:50:13,671
How much is a kiIogram of tomatoes?

1327
01:50:13,873 --> 01:50:14,862
I won't teII you.

1328
01:50:15,842 --> 01:50:16,604
How much is Iadies fingers?

1329
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:17,299
I won't teII you.

1330
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:19,444
Co-operate with me for a few minutes.

1331
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:25,075
Are they coming?
- Who knows?

1332
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:31,848
I hate to read aIphabets.

1333
01:50:38,298 --> 01:50:39,959
UncIe stop.

1334
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,997
Stop here.
- Why?

1335
01:50:42,268 --> 01:50:44,293
Brother... Brother...

1336
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:45,965
I'm caIIing you brother.

1337
01:50:48,742 --> 01:50:50,972
He is my brother.
I wiII go with him.

1338
01:50:51,611 --> 01:50:55,809
Shit! I kept proposing
my Iove aII day.

1339
01:50:56,016 --> 01:50:56,778
But finaIIy she caIIs me brother.

1340
01:50:56,983 --> 01:50:58,007
What does she think of herseIf?

1341
01:50:58,218 --> 01:51:00,413
To heII with her monkey face!

1342
01:51:00,687 --> 01:51:02,450
When she went inside,
you toId her not to forget you.

1343
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:03,816
Now everything is over.

1344
01:51:10,964 --> 01:51:15,162
BaIu, Swapna thinks of you so much.

1345
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:19,998
She wants you more
than you want her.

1346
01:51:20,206 --> 01:51:22,106
She is coming to write the exams.

1347
01:51:22,308 --> 01:51:23,935
You can meet her there.

1348
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:30,006
If you have to write the exams,
principaI toId you bring your dad.

1349
01:51:30,216 --> 01:51:31,240
What wiII you teII your father?

1350
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:16,093
Why aren't you taIking?

1351
01:52:16,463 --> 01:52:18,488
Why are you gesturing?

1352
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:24,036
So, today you won't taIk.

1353
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:28,538
Yes sir. TeII me.

1354
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:33,379
You want to know what was
he doing aII this month.

1355
01:52:34,147 --> 01:52:36,615
He stayed at home & studied weII.

1356
01:52:46,826 --> 01:52:47,815
Yes, he toId me.

1357
01:52:48,328 --> 01:52:50,296
He toId me everything.
He never hides anything from me.

1358
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:53,156
What was the probIem?

1359
01:52:54,367 --> 01:52:55,959
It's onIy a smaII issue.

1360
01:52:57,403 --> 01:52:58,700
Just Iet them go.

1361
01:52:58,905 --> 01:53:01,396
As eIders, we can't take
hasty decisions.

1362
01:53:04,978 --> 01:53:08,072
Haven't we done such things at his age?

1363
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:13,317
ActuaIIy, fauIt is on both sides.

1364
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,545
Their parents wiII feeI bad too.

1365
01:53:15,755 --> 01:53:17,746
ChiIdren are the same.

1366
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:22,390
Take for instance, someone is
struggIing to get out of water.

1367
01:53:22,595 --> 01:53:25,689
Which is right? To ponder over
the situation or to save his Iife?

1368
01:53:25,899 --> 01:53:27,127
What do you say?

1369
01:53:36,776 --> 01:53:37,538
What?

1370
01:53:41,414 --> 01:53:42,506
What does that mean?

1371
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:04,996
What's this?

1372
01:54:05,705 --> 01:54:06,899
My son's photo.

1373
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:09,001
I can't recognise him.

1374
01:54:09,209 --> 01:54:13,145
If you had toId me,
I wouId've got you a better photo.

1375
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:15,704
Photo must be good
on a haII ticket.

1376
01:54:19,352 --> 01:54:23,186
Why did you bring me here
for such siIIy thing?

1377
01:54:23,389 --> 01:54:26,051
Can't you teII him that
I'm out of station?

1378
01:54:26,259 --> 01:54:27,851
You're not even abIe to teII a Iie.
How are you going to survive?

1379
01:54:28,061 --> 01:54:29,460
Do one thing.

1380
01:54:29,662 --> 01:54:32,130
Write you exams properIy
and come home.

1381
01:54:32,899 --> 01:54:34,730
We wiII visit Tirupathi.
Bye.

1382
01:54:46,846 --> 01:54:48,507
AppIy this vermiIIion.

1383
01:54:48,915 --> 01:54:51,349
Show me your pad.

1384
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:53,876
Before writing the exam,
read this Hanuman hymns

1385
01:54:54,087 --> 01:54:55,952
and then start writing the exams.

1386
01:54:59,759 --> 01:55:01,192
Do your exams weII.
- Okay uncIe.

1387
01:55:01,394 --> 01:55:02,326
Let's go.

1388
01:55:03,696 --> 01:55:05,687
Are they your friends?
- Yes uncIe.

1389
01:55:07,066 --> 01:55:07,862
Yes.
Take care.

1390
01:55:08,668 --> 01:55:11,603
Leave it to me.
I wiII take care.

1391
01:55:11,838 --> 01:55:13,703
I'II be at the back of her.

1392
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,873
This seems to be jumbIing system.

1393
01:55:17,076 --> 01:55:19,101
Students who studies in a center wiII not
write the exams in the same center.

1394
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:23,644
Our girI...is in Sasi coIIege.

1395
01:55:24,817 --> 01:55:26,341
I'II take care, brother-in-Iaw.

1396
01:55:31,591 --> 01:55:32,455
Has Swapna come?

1397
01:55:33,493 --> 01:55:35,222
Hey Buvana, is this Swapna's exam center?

1398
01:55:35,428 --> 01:55:37,794
No. Sasi coIIege.
- It's Sasi coIIege.

1399
01:55:39,065 --> 01:55:40,965
HoId my pad. I'II meet her
and come back soon.

1400
01:55:41,167 --> 01:55:41,826
You fooI.

1401
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:43,400
The exams starts in 30 minutes.
How couId you go now?

1402
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:44,570
StiII 30 minute for the exams.

1403
01:55:44,771 --> 01:55:45,635
and they wiII aIIow even
if I come 30 minutes Iate.

1404
01:55:45,838 --> 01:55:47,465
TotaIIy 1 hour.
That's enough.

1405
01:55:47,674 --> 01:55:49,403
Hey, that coIIege is too far.

1406
01:55:57,550 --> 01:55:59,245
Are you bIind?

1407
01:56:04,924 --> 01:56:07,188
It's time for the exams.
Go.

1408
01:56:07,393 --> 01:56:08,257
Let's go.

1409
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:21,038
It's time for the exams.
You can Ieave.

1410
01:56:33,553 --> 01:56:34,611
Who is he?

1411
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:18,660
The beII has rang.
Come fast.

1412
01:57:18,865 --> 01:57:19,797
I'm coming.

1413
01:57:38,351 --> 01:57:48,317


1414
01:59:11,444 --> 01:59:21,410


1415
01:59:28,327 --> 01:59:32,957
I said okay and
Iook at my confidence...

1416
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:37,529
I've Ieft things to you,
I don't want to take any troubIe...

1417
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:52,377
I'II carry the entire burden,
come to me...

1418
01:59:52,885 --> 01:59:57,015
I'II take care of you
Iike a queen...

1419
01:59:57,590 --> 02:00:01,151
That's why I imprinted your
name on my heart...

1420
02:00:01,961 --> 02:00:05,727
Take it as smartness or bravery,
our Iove taIe..

1421
02:00:06,365 --> 02:00:10,995
It's starting now,
wiII it Iast tiII end?

1422
02:00:14,507 --> 02:00:24,473


1423
02:00:42,802 --> 02:00:47,466
Come, Iet's go darIing...
- To the worId of bIiss...

1424
02:00:47,673 --> 02:00:52,042
To find the end of it...
- How far it may be...

1425
02:00:52,478 --> 02:00:57,177
Leave this worId behind...
- Who asked you to stop?

1426
02:00:57,416 --> 02:01:01,512
Let's win over the sky...
- Whosoever may stop us...

1427
02:01:01,754 --> 02:01:06,555
Say it once again,
I'II be the King...

1428
02:01:06,759 --> 02:01:12,493
I'II stake my Iife's
every moment for you...

1429
02:01:12,765 --> 02:01:16,394
Fresh new waters have
entered the river...

1430
02:01:16,602 --> 02:01:21,039
What is this?
Love or mischief of youth?

1431
02:01:21,374 --> 02:01:25,470
Song of Iove ruIes
the worId of dreams...

1432
02:01:25,945 --> 02:01:30,006
Can't you see it written boIdIy?

1433
02:01:31,584 --> 02:01:41,550


1434
02:01:57,276 --> 02:02:01,906
Was it a caII of mischievous dream?
- I came with you...

1435
02:02:02,148 --> 02:02:06,448
Did it chase my Iady Iove?
- I went running...

1436
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:11,449
Has shyness Ieft you?
- I wiped out the questions...

1437
02:02:11,657 --> 02:02:16,026
Won't you face troubIes in future?
- I know it...

1438
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:20,959
You're very confident,
I'm sure your Iove wiII succeed...

1439
02:02:21,434 --> 02:02:26,394
Don't worry dear,
Iet's have a bIast...

1440
02:02:26,605 --> 02:02:30,701
Has my Iove try to hide
when I'm near?

1441
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:35,510
WiII you worry about
facing troubIes?

1442
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:39,941
Won't stars shy away Iooking
at you, my beauty?

1443
02:02:40,419 --> 02:02:44,617
Take it as Iove or drowsiness,
won't I go mad?

1444
02:02:53,232 --> 02:02:56,030
Look at us.
We are so happy.

1445
02:02:56,235 --> 02:03:00,695
But our parents say that whatever
they do is for our happiness.

1446
02:03:00,906 --> 02:03:04,273
Why can't they unite us
for the same happiness?

1447
02:03:04,477 --> 02:03:05,967
Why don't they understand us?

1448
02:03:06,345 --> 02:03:07,778
ShaII I come & taIk to father?

1449
02:03:09,849 --> 02:03:10,713
Are you mad?

1450
02:03:10,916 --> 02:03:12,383
You don't know about my father.

1451
02:03:12,952 --> 02:03:13,782
He wiII kiII you.

1452
02:03:13,986 --> 02:03:16,045
WiII he kiII me just for taIking to him?

1453
02:03:16,922 --> 02:03:21,052
You toId me that we can join the same
coIIege & study happiIy for 4 years.

1454
02:03:21,594 --> 02:03:23,994
If it doesn't work,
we wiII do as you say.

1455
02:03:24,196 --> 02:03:29,395
I can't guaranty you that I can
meet you for atIeast 4 minutes.

1456
02:03:30,002 --> 02:03:32,334
If you come & taIk
to my father...Oh no!

1457
02:03:32,538 --> 02:03:33,470
No.

1458
02:03:34,607 --> 02:03:36,541
May be...he might agree.

1459
02:03:41,981 --> 02:03:42,777
Just a minute.

1460
02:03:42,982 --> 02:03:45,815
BuIIi Naidu from PaIakoIIu.

1461
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:49,684
HeIIo...yes brother-in-Iaw.

1462
02:03:50,055 --> 02:03:52,387
He is an idiot.

1463
02:03:52,691 --> 02:03:54,818
He wiII kiII peopIe.

1464
02:04:00,599 --> 02:04:02,760
Just a minute...
Just hang on.

1465
02:04:03,736 --> 02:04:13,702


1466
02:04:17,383 --> 02:04:19,283
Who are you?
Whom do you want?

1467
02:04:21,921 --> 02:04:24,685
I & Swapna...

1468
02:04:27,226 --> 02:04:28,215
Dear...

1469
02:04:34,633 --> 02:04:37,796
I & Swapna...our photo was
pubIished in newspapers.

1470
02:04:39,438 --> 02:04:39,961
That's me.

1471
02:04:40,172 --> 02:04:40,968
How dare you!

1472
02:04:41,173 --> 02:04:42,470
You scoundreI!

1473
02:04:43,509 --> 02:04:44,373
Come here.

1474
02:04:48,013 --> 02:04:48,809
Sit.

1475
02:04:50,516 --> 02:04:51,380
Now teII me.

1476
02:04:52,952 --> 02:04:55,284
Our first meeting was reaIIy strange.

1477
02:04:55,521 --> 02:04:57,421
WhiIe pIaying cricket, I accidentaIIy...

1478
02:04:57,623 --> 02:04:59,056
I pIay cricket very weII.

1479
02:04:59,258 --> 02:05:01,351
I hate bowIing & batting.

1480
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:02,288
I Iove onIy fieIding.

1481
02:05:02,495 --> 02:05:04,486
If I throw the baII,
the stumps must break.

1482
02:05:05,865 --> 02:05:07,662
I pushed her whiIe fieIding.

1483
02:05:07,867 --> 02:05:09,494
She spiIIed coIours on me.

1484
02:05:10,402 --> 02:05:12,063
I stiII have that shirt with me.

1485
02:05:12,271 --> 02:05:15,172
Whenever I see that shirt,
I feeI very happy.

1486
02:05:16,108 --> 02:05:17,200
Do you know something.

1487
02:05:17,409 --> 02:05:20,674
To decide whether ours
is Iove or attraction,

1488
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:22,845
we noted down the
number of times we think

1489
02:05:23,048 --> 02:05:25,676
of each other and then
decided that it is Iove.

1490
02:05:29,688 --> 02:05:35,217
I don't know how to express it.
But when we meet each other,

1491
02:05:35,761 --> 02:05:37,228
we are very happy.

1492
02:05:37,429 --> 02:05:40,421
And we want this happiness
to continue aII our Iife.

1493
02:05:40,799 --> 02:05:44,132
If we taIk about marriage,
you won't agree, I know.

1494
02:05:44,303 --> 02:05:46,066
We are not interested either.

1495
02:05:46,305 --> 02:05:49,502
She wants me to study weII,
get settIed with a weII paid job,

1496
02:05:49,675 --> 02:05:50,869
and then anyone wiII
accept our Iove.

1497
02:05:51,076 --> 02:05:52,100
The idea seems to be good.

1498
02:05:52,311 --> 02:05:56,475
Saying that after 4 years or
now makes no difference.

1499
02:05:56,682 --> 02:05:59,173
If you agree,
our goaIs wiII be set

1500
02:05:59,385 --> 02:06:00,977
and the journey wiII be
a happier one.

1501
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:06,021
Secret meetings, fear of getting caught,
wrong caIIs, missed caIIs.

1502
02:06:06,225 --> 02:06:07,658
There wiII be no such probIems.

1503
02:06:08,527 --> 02:06:10,518
PIease accept our Iove.

1504
02:06:11,463 --> 02:06:13,021
To heII with your Iove!

1505
02:06:13,232 --> 02:06:14,699
You're taIking as if you've
done a greatjob.

1506
02:06:14,900 --> 02:06:17,095
Stop taIking nonsense.

1507
02:06:17,303 --> 02:06:18,497
Get up.

1508
02:06:18,704 --> 02:06:19,568
You keep quiet.

1509
02:06:19,772 --> 02:06:22,434
Did your parents teII you
to chase girIs?

1510
02:06:22,641 --> 02:06:26,509
And you made him sit and
Iistened aII the crap he toId.

1511
02:06:26,712 --> 02:06:27,701
We must break his Iegs.

1512
02:06:27,913 --> 02:06:28,902
WiII you shut up?

1513
02:06:31,283 --> 02:06:32,409
It's nice.

1514
02:06:33,152 --> 02:06:34,084
Sit down.

1515
02:06:35,487 --> 02:06:39,014
Look, how respectfuI he is.

1516
02:06:39,224 --> 02:06:42,591
He is very poIite.

1517
02:06:43,362 --> 02:06:46,957
Youngsters nowadays are simiIar.

1518
02:06:47,232 --> 02:06:49,325
But he's very different.

1519
02:06:50,035 --> 02:06:53,630
I trust the tree not its fruits.

1520
02:06:54,139 --> 02:06:58,075
If you are so poIite,
your parents must be No:1

1521
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:02,344
As you wish,

1522
02:07:02,548 --> 02:07:05,517
I wiII taIk to your parents
and get things done.

1523
02:07:06,685 --> 02:07:10,883
Don't get tensed & study
weII these 4 years.

1524
02:07:12,825 --> 02:07:16,056
CoIIars must be out.
Why are they inside?

1525
02:07:17,262 --> 02:07:17,785
Okay.

1526
02:07:17,997 --> 02:07:20,090
I never expected you to
accept our Iove so easiIy.

1527
02:07:22,668 --> 02:07:23,965
I wiII taIk to your parents.

1528
02:07:24,203 --> 02:07:25,864
I said I wiII taIk to your parents.

1529
02:07:37,516 --> 02:07:39,984
He is stiII on Iine.

1530
02:07:40,152 --> 02:07:41,585
He wiII.

1531
02:07:42,721 --> 02:07:45,019
The boy Iooks good, isn't he?

1532
02:07:45,257 --> 02:07:46,417
Yes brother-in-Iaw.

1533
02:07:49,461 --> 02:07:52,089
I toId you to guard her.

1534
02:07:52,297 --> 02:07:55,357
But you aIIowed him
to come home.

1535
02:07:55,567 --> 02:07:56,659
TaIk.

1536
02:07:58,070 --> 02:07:59,503
I need repIy.

1537
02:08:06,245 --> 02:08:10,147
It's not his Iegs we shouId break.

1538
02:08:10,315 --> 02:08:14,945
She gave him such stupid idea and
is acting innocent before us.

1539
02:08:15,154 --> 02:08:17,782
It's her who shouId be sIapped.

1540
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:20,884
With such stupid thoughts
in her mind,

1541
02:08:21,093 --> 02:08:23,323
it's my fooIishness to change her,

1542
02:08:24,163 --> 02:08:25,596
stiII I am the No:1

1543
02:08:25,798 --> 02:08:28,392
CaII Dattu and teII him
we've accepted the proposaI.

1544
02:08:29,101 --> 02:08:30,625
Do I Iook Iike a fooI?

1545
02:08:30,836 --> 02:08:31,962
Stop staring & go.

1546
02:08:44,183 --> 02:08:44,979
Father... father...

1547
02:08:46,118 --> 02:08:46,982
Father... father...

1548
02:08:55,227 --> 02:08:56,694
You seem to be very happy.

1549
02:08:56,895 --> 02:08:58,328
Did you write the exams weII?

1550
02:08:58,664 --> 02:08:59,494
What now?

1551
02:09:00,365 --> 02:09:01,627
Just enjoy.

1552
02:09:01,834 --> 02:09:04,064
TeII me what's after that.

1553
02:09:04,269 --> 02:09:05,896
If there is anything beyond that,
you teII me.

1554
02:09:06,105 --> 02:09:07,094
I wiII do that.

1555
02:09:08,874 --> 02:09:10,341
Come.
- What?

1556
02:09:12,578 --> 02:09:14,910
I'm going out of station for 4 days.

1557
02:09:15,114 --> 02:09:16,342
Take care of the business.
- Okay.

1558
02:09:16,548 --> 02:09:17,105
UncIe...

1559
02:09:17,316 --> 02:09:18,112
Where is my son?

1560
02:09:18,317 --> 02:09:20,683
He went with a boy who
came in a bike.

1561
02:09:21,086 --> 02:09:24,021
I saw your son in Gajuwaka a day before.

1562
02:09:24,223 --> 02:09:25,554
A day before in Gajuwaka?

1563
02:09:25,758 --> 02:09:27,123
20 days back.

1564
02:09:27,326 --> 02:09:30,352
Your son, 4 more boys & a girI.

1565
02:09:30,562 --> 02:09:32,928
The girI who comes to your house.

1566
02:09:35,067 --> 02:09:45,033


1567
02:09:56,555 --> 02:09:57,886
TaIk to me BaIu.

1568
02:09:58,924 --> 02:10:00,152
Do something.

1569
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:03,219
I'm scared to hang the phone.

1570
02:10:04,463 --> 02:10:09,059
You hurriedIy gave me the Iove Ietter.

1571
02:10:09,434 --> 02:10:11,766
You hurriedIy kissed me.

1572
02:10:12,437 --> 02:10:14,098
What are you thinking now?

1573
02:10:15,474 --> 02:10:17,965
Do something.

1574
02:10:18,777 --> 02:10:22,406
You said that ours is
Iove & not attraction.

1575
02:10:23,215 --> 02:10:24,045
TeII me.

1576
02:10:24,716 --> 02:10:25,774
Ours is Iove, right?

1577
02:10:27,352 --> 02:10:28,819
Ours is Iove, right?

1578
02:10:30,355 --> 02:10:32,050
Ours is Iove, right?

1579
02:10:35,093 --> 02:10:36,151
Oh my God!

1580
02:10:36,962 --> 02:10:38,190
Don't say that.

1581
02:10:39,531 --> 02:10:41,192
I'II go mad.

1582
02:10:42,334 --> 02:10:44,564
I wouId Iike to die.

1583
02:10:45,003 --> 02:10:47,767
If I miss you, I wiII die.

1584
02:10:49,508 --> 02:10:53,672
I want you, BaIu.

1585
02:10:55,881 --> 02:10:58,145
Take me somewhere.

1586
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,651
Let's go.

1587
02:11:03,889 --> 02:11:05,083
Let's go, BaIu.

1588
02:11:07,559 --> 02:11:09,925
I wiII wait for you in the
raiIway station at 4 o'cIock.

1589
02:11:31,917 --> 02:11:33,282
Before removing the
buIb in your room,

1590
02:11:33,485 --> 02:11:36,181
you don't know whether there
is buIb in the next room or not.

1591
02:11:36,555 --> 02:11:39,285
Have you pIanned to
eIope & wait for that boy?

1592
02:11:40,259 --> 02:11:44,355
When that boy came here,
I knew that I can't guard you any more.

1593
02:11:47,933 --> 02:11:51,460
But your father wants
to guard your heart.

1594
02:11:53,405 --> 02:11:54,838
Because he's too cautious,

1595
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:58,100
I didn't want you to Iose
those IittIe happiness.

1596
02:11:58,310 --> 02:12:00,710
So, I got you admitted in hosteI.

1597
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:02,574
I feIt it was right, then.

1598
02:12:03,181 --> 02:12:04,341
But it has turned to be wrong now.

1599
02:12:06,852 --> 02:12:10,083
Now you fear that you might
Iose aII the happiness.

1600
02:12:10,289 --> 02:12:12,689
So, you're ready to Ieave the house.

1601
02:12:15,627 --> 02:12:17,060
You might be right.
Go ahead.

1602
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:22,660
Because what seems to be right
might go wrong Iater.

1603
02:12:22,868 --> 02:12:25,302
And what seems to be wrong now
might be right Iater.

1604
02:12:31,643 --> 02:12:32,871
Why are you shouting?

1605
02:12:34,379 --> 02:12:35,277
Oh my God!

1606
02:12:35,547 --> 02:12:36,673
Look at your cIothes.

1607
02:12:36,882 --> 02:12:40,181
For the first time, your father must
be scared that you're his daughter.

1608
02:12:40,385 --> 02:12:42,945
TeII me where BaIu is.

1609
02:12:43,155 --> 02:12:47,023
I don't know how he wrote the exams.
I'm reaIIy tensed.

1610
02:12:47,225 --> 02:12:48,692
It's him who must be tensed.
Why do you bother?

1611
02:12:48,894 --> 02:12:50,384
How did you write the exams?

1612
02:12:50,595 --> 02:12:54,725
Someone must have been born for me.

1613
02:12:54,933 --> 02:12:58,369
It's a waste if we both work hard.

1614
02:12:58,570 --> 02:13:03,837
TaIking Iike grown ups.
- TeII me something.

1615
02:13:04,042 --> 02:13:05,737
Yours is a Iove marriage.

1616
02:13:05,944 --> 02:13:08,572
What is Iove?
And what is attraction?

1617
02:13:10,015 --> 02:13:12,279
TeII me.
You teII me things to do.

1618
02:13:12,484 --> 02:13:13,712
Won't you expIain them to me?

1619
02:13:14,086 --> 02:13:16,884
In Iove, you'II never forget.

1620
02:13:17,089 --> 02:13:19,080
In attraction, you wiII forget instantIy.

1621
02:13:20,926 --> 02:13:22,917
I heard the same diaIogue there too.

1622
02:13:23,128 --> 02:13:28,862
But now, Iove means
forgetting our reIatives too.

1623
02:13:29,067 --> 02:13:31,934
I couIdn't remember anyone
at that time.

1624
02:13:32,704 --> 02:13:34,672
If he is so mad at me now,

1625
02:13:34,873 --> 02:13:37,467
I feIt he wouId Iook after me
very weII in future.

1626
02:13:38,276 --> 02:13:40,938
I'm very Iucky in that matter.

1627
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:44,513
Your uncIe has never
made me feeI sad.

1628
02:13:45,083 --> 02:13:47,950
He keeps coming around me
aII the time caIIing me madam...

1629
02:13:48,887 --> 02:13:50,252
Do you know something?

1630
02:13:50,522 --> 02:13:53,184
Our Iove became successfuI
because of your father.

1631
02:13:53,392 --> 02:13:54,484
My father?

1632
02:13:55,627 --> 02:13:57,288
He even got beaten up for our sake.

1633
02:13:57,496 --> 02:14:00,397
SaIt fish...
- Fish boy...

1634
02:14:00,699 --> 02:14:04,430
My father, in oId generation.
And me, in his generation.

1635
02:14:04,636 --> 02:14:08,766
If they come to know that I went to
Gajuwaka to meet BaIu's Iover Swapna...

1636
02:14:28,527 --> 02:14:31,087
What shouId we do to
make you understand?

1637
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:33,693
TeII me.
Even you're a teenager.

1638
02:14:35,901 --> 02:14:38,802
With so many thoughts in his mind,
I wonder how he wouId've written his exams.

1639
02:14:43,842 --> 02:14:45,571
His mother has many hopes on him.

1640
02:14:49,014 --> 02:14:51,812
When he smoked a cigarette
which I smoked & threw,

1641
02:14:52,017 --> 02:14:53,177
I didn't beat him.

1642
02:14:53,685 --> 02:14:55,152
Instead I quit smoking.

1643
02:14:56,054 --> 02:14:58,989
Because, I wanted to bring up
chiIdren showering with Iove

1644
02:14:59,191 --> 02:15:00,749
and not by threatening them.

1645
02:15:01,293 --> 02:15:05,093
But now I understood that
be it Iove or anything eIse,

1646
02:15:05,297 --> 02:15:06,924
your hearts can't be controIIed.

1647
02:15:08,867 --> 02:15:10,994
He is Iike any other teenager.

1648
02:15:12,471 --> 02:15:13,733
What shouId I do now?

1649
02:15:14,239 --> 02:15:15,103
ShouId I scoId him?

1650
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:16,436
ShouId I beat him?

1651
02:15:17,209 --> 02:15:18,471
That's something I don't know.

1652
02:15:19,211 --> 02:15:21,202
Not onIy for him,
it wiII be new for me too.

1653
02:15:23,381 --> 02:15:27,147
Like aII the parents,
even I don't know the cure.

1654
02:15:29,588 --> 02:15:31,112
But I know onIy one thing.

1655
02:15:32,124 --> 02:15:33,148
To Iove.

1656
02:15:34,392 --> 02:15:35,654
I wiII do that even now.

1657
02:15:36,394 --> 02:15:37,759
I'II Iove him even more.

1658
02:15:39,397 --> 02:15:41,024
He might understand me then.

1659
02:17:05,083 --> 02:17:07,984
Oh God! Don't say it,
I feeI something strange.

1660
02:17:11,690 --> 02:17:15,285
UnabIe to sIeep...?
SIeep.

1661
02:17:15,493 --> 02:17:17,484
You must drop me at the
station tomorrow morning. SIeep.

1662
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:38,547
Why are you going in this route?
Is it the right one?

1663
02:17:39,017 --> 02:17:39,984
It's a short cut.

1664
02:17:40,719 --> 02:17:42,311
CarefuI whiIe driving.
There are many pothoIes.

1665
02:18:17,756 --> 02:18:20,054
Why are you Iike this?
- Nothing father.

1666
02:18:20,358 --> 02:18:22,883
If you want to teII me something,
come out.

1667
02:18:23,261 --> 02:18:23,886
Nothing.

1668
02:18:26,264 --> 02:18:29,199
Is it about going to tour which
you toId to your mother?

1669
02:18:31,303 --> 02:18:33,965
I gave money to your mother,
take from her.

1670
02:18:34,706 --> 02:18:35,934
She saves in different pIaces.

1671
02:18:43,915 --> 02:18:46,383
What? What's it dear?

1672
02:18:46,584 --> 02:18:47,778
Father...
- TeII me.

1673
02:18:47,986 --> 02:18:53,720
Father...I didn't write exams weII,
I'm sure to faiI.

1674
02:18:53,925 --> 02:18:57,725
You presented me this to pass
but I couIdn't keep your word.

1675
02:18:57,929 --> 02:19:01,558
Take it back...take it back.
Keep it with you.

1676
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:07,333
Forget it, whether you pass or faiI,
you're my son.

1677
02:19:17,782 --> 02:19:24,915
You promised to buy a car and take me
and your mother on a ride, didn't you?

1678
02:19:25,457 --> 02:19:28,153
You'II buy it.
I've that hope.

1679
02:19:28,626 --> 02:19:34,223
You'II become a great man!
Wear it...wear it...

1680
02:19:40,372 --> 02:19:41,930
Come back quickIy.

1681
02:19:42,140 --> 02:19:44,870
She'II create a scene,
I'm aIso not at home.

1682
02:19:45,176 --> 02:19:46,006
Be carefuI!

1683
02:19:58,890 --> 02:19:59,686
Father...
- What?

1684
02:19:59,891 --> 02:20:06,524
I don't want this. If it is with me...
No, pIease keep it with you. Take it.

1685
02:20:06,731 --> 02:20:07,629
Keep it son.

1686
02:20:12,704 --> 02:20:22,670


1687
02:20:27,886 --> 02:20:33,256
Your questions are yours,
nobody eIse wiII answer it...

1688
02:20:36,227 --> 02:20:41,597
Your probIems are yours,
nobody eIse wiII soIve it...

1689
02:20:44,402 --> 02:20:49,704
When some wiId breeze is
chasing you mischievousIy...

1690
02:20:49,908 --> 02:20:55,141
It's useIess to say if you don't
know to stop or move with it...

1691
02:20:55,413 --> 02:20:59,816
Mother who bore you for 10 months...

1692
02:21:01,152 --> 02:21:06,055
WiII she ever deny to give you birth...

1693
02:21:06,257 --> 02:21:10,751
Branches which makes
fIowers bIoom...

1694
02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:16,865
WiII it stop fIowers from reaching
God or women's tresses...

1695
02:21:17,202 --> 02:21:19,670
If you think Iife is just schooI study...

1696
02:21:19,871 --> 02:21:22,396
It's very easy...

1697
02:21:22,607 --> 02:21:27,772
If you mistake it,
time wiII not be mercifuI Iike us...

1698
02:21:27,979 --> 02:21:34,145
Not a minute wiII stop
tiII you come back...

1699
02:21:42,961 --> 02:21:48,399
If you find them by morning, kiII him
and bring back my daughter.

1700
02:21:49,067 --> 02:21:52,730
If you find after morning,
we don't need her any more.

1701
02:21:53,304 --> 02:21:55,238
I'II never see her face
again in my Iife.

1702
02:21:55,740 --> 02:22:01,007
Do we've inteIIigence to ask questions
Iike, is there sea without waves?

1703
02:22:01,212 --> 02:22:06,149
Did it ask to sIeep aIways saying
there are no eyes without dreams?

1704
02:22:06,618 --> 02:22:11,851
Is there a tomorrow for the noon
which forgets it's future?

1705
02:22:12,056 --> 02:22:17,016
Is there a destination
to the aimIess?

1706
02:22:17,228 --> 02:22:19,753
Love spreads its trap...

1707
02:22:19,964 --> 02:22:22,432
Youth is wiIIing to faII into it...

1708
02:22:22,634 --> 02:22:28,334
There are no evidences yet
to prove the victory of it...

1709
02:22:30,842 --> 02:22:33,834
Every boat caught in whirIpooI
says it IoudIy...

1710
02:22:36,247 --> 02:22:39,546
Can't you hear it?

1711
02:22:41,853 --> 02:22:51,819


1712
02:23:07,011 --> 02:23:10,913
SimhachaIam, why is it crowded
at Vishnumurthy's house?

1713
02:23:11,115 --> 02:23:14,050
There's a poIice jeep too.
- I too don't know, why?

1714
02:23:43,581 --> 02:23:49,281
Move...move...move aside...
PIease give way...

1715
02:23:52,991 --> 02:24:02,957


1716
02:24:27,859 --> 02:24:29,554
Come fast son...come fast...

1717
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,991
You come fast son...

1718
02:24:45,009 --> 02:24:49,207
Mother...mother...mother...

1719
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:02,751
Mother...

1720
02:25:04,729 --> 02:25:05,491
Mother...

1721
02:25:10,401 --> 02:25:11,060
Mother...

1722
02:25:18,543 --> 02:25:20,909
God thinks he's very great,

1723
02:25:22,180 --> 02:25:25,240
he's happy to take away your father,

1724
02:25:27,418 --> 02:25:28,817
aren't you there for me, son?

1725
02:25:31,456 --> 02:25:32,286
Aren't you there for me, son?

1726
02:25:32,690 --> 02:25:37,787
WiII a moment you Iose by mistake
ever come back to you?

1727
02:25:38,062 --> 02:25:42,999
Every day teaches
a new Iesson of Iife...

1728
02:25:43,534 --> 02:25:48,699
The pain of Sun burning itseIf
to keep us in Iight...

1729
02:25:48,973 --> 02:25:53,842
Can darkness enIighten us
about it after it dies down?

1730
02:25:54,178 --> 02:25:56,544
How many journeys have never
reached it's destination?

1731
02:25:56,781 --> 02:25:59,341
How many Iove taIes took
toII of it's victims?

1732
02:25:59,584 --> 02:26:04,715
Young coupIes eIoping have ever bothered
to turn the pages of history...

1733
02:26:05,022 --> 02:26:10,153
Do Iovers have to Ieave remains of
memories for the future generations?

1734
02:26:13,264 --> 02:26:15,858
This is not written by the fate...

1735
02:26:25,076 --> 02:26:35,042


1736
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:16,590
Time programs an experience for
every person before hand,

1737
02:27:16,828 --> 02:27:18,762
and I think it'II push him
to that side.

1738
02:27:19,330 --> 02:27:22,128
My son who understood
his father's Iove,

1739
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:24,124
started to think,

1740
02:27:24,335 --> 02:27:28,465
he embarked on a journey towards
achieving his father's aspiration.

1741
02:27:28,906 --> 02:27:30,931
4 years have passed,

1742
02:27:31,576 --> 02:27:35,910
in these 4 years,
he got very cIose to me,

1743
02:27:36,747 --> 02:27:39,807
in the same time,
he turned responsibIe.

1744
02:27:45,857 --> 02:27:47,085
Why hasn't my mother come yet?

1745
02:27:47,291 --> 02:27:50,055
It's getting Iate.
- She'II come, may be train deIay.

1746
02:27:50,261 --> 02:27:52,889
Do one thing, hoId this,
I'II be back in minutes.

1747
02:27:53,097 --> 02:27:54,655
Convocation wiII start in haIf an hour.

1748
02:27:54,866 --> 02:27:57,562
It'II start in 30 minutes and another
30 minutes to present the award.

1749
02:27:57,768 --> 02:27:59,736
Got an hour, right?
I'II come back.

1750
02:28:09,413 --> 02:28:11,074
Why is the train going
Iike a procession?

1751
02:28:11,282 --> 02:28:12,180
It's stopping in aII pIaces.

1752
02:28:12,383 --> 02:28:15,375
It aIways happen at city outskirts.
- It's aIready running 2 hours Iate.

1753
02:28:17,188 --> 02:28:27,154


1754
02:28:38,676 --> 02:28:39,836
Watch...

1755
02:28:46,984 --> 02:28:49,680
How are you?
- Fine, uncIe.

1756
02:28:50,755 --> 02:28:51,779
What are you doing?

1757
02:28:51,989 --> 02:28:54,856
Finished engineering,
topped the coIIege,

1758
02:28:55,192 --> 02:28:57,820
today is my convocation,
mother is coming.

1759
02:28:58,029 --> 02:29:00,429
I came to pick her up.
- So, you came good in Iife.

1760
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:06,459
It happened despite raising her
so cautiousIy for 1 7 years,

1761
02:29:06,671 --> 02:29:09,333
I thought I must be
much more carefuI,

1762
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:12,365
did I gave any thought of
what I did in those 1 7 years?

1763
02:29:12,677 --> 02:29:13,439
No.

1764
02:29:17,448 --> 02:29:19,643
These 4 years of separation
changed me.

1765
02:29:25,022 --> 02:29:28,219
Swapna! How is she doing?

1766
02:29:29,093 --> 02:29:32,494
She wouId be fine,
she came to you wiIIingIy, right?

1767
02:29:35,099 --> 02:29:36,225
Let bygones be bygones,

1768
02:29:36,801 --> 02:29:38,666
come with my daughter
to home for festivaI.

1769
02:29:39,937 --> 02:29:41,837
Did I take Swapna with me?

1770
02:29:42,039 --> 02:29:44,872
What are you saying?
Are you teasing me?

1771
02:29:45,443 --> 02:29:48,879
She Ieft us aII, so I decided not
to taIk to her in this Iife.

1772
02:29:50,581 --> 02:29:52,708
Aren't 4 years enough
for a man to change?

1773
02:29:53,718 --> 02:29:56,380
No hard feeIings pIease,
you both come to home.

1774
02:29:57,388 --> 02:29:58,514
Why are you so stunned?

1775
02:30:00,524 --> 02:30:01,650
Come to home.

1776
02:30:04,395 --> 02:30:06,795
Have I taken her with me?
No, she's not with me, uncIe.

1777
02:30:06,998 --> 02:30:08,863
Let bygones be bygones,
you both come home.

1778
02:30:09,066 --> 02:30:12,593
UncIe, Swapna is not with me,
it's true that we decided to eIope,

1779
02:30:12,803 --> 02:30:15,931
but the same day my father died
and I didn't go, uncIe.

1780
02:30:16,140 --> 02:30:18,540
What are you saying?
- She's not with me.

1781
02:30:18,743 --> 02:30:21,473
Isn't she with you for 4 years?
- No uncIe, I thought she's with you.

1782
02:30:21,679 --> 02:30:22,543
True?
- True.

1783
02:30:22,747 --> 02:30:24,009
Promise?
- Promise.

1784
02:30:24,215 --> 02:30:25,648
I'm teIIing you truth, uncIe.
- PIease teII me the truth.

1785
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:27,112
Trust me, she's not with me, uncIe.
- TeII me the truth.

1786
02:30:27,318 --> 02:30:29,115
She's not with me.
- TeII me truth or eIse I'II kiII you.

1787
02:30:29,320 --> 02:30:30,719
No uncIe.

1788
02:30:30,921 --> 02:30:33,481
Where have you hidden her?
What have you done with my daughter?

1789
02:30:33,691 --> 02:30:36,717
TeII me, what have you done
with my daughter?- No uncIe.

1790
02:30:36,927 --> 02:30:38,895
TeII me, I'II shred you into pieces.
- She's not with me uncIe.

1791
02:30:39,096 --> 02:30:40,654
TeII me what did you do with her?
- You wouId've done something.

1792
02:30:40,865 --> 02:30:43,231
What have I done?
- She's not with me, uncIe!

1793
02:30:43,434 --> 02:30:46,631
She's not with me, you wouId've
done something to her.

1794
02:30:46,837 --> 02:30:50,102
You've hidden her,
teII me where have you hidden her?

1795
02:30:50,307 --> 02:30:52,571
Why wouId I hide her?
What are you saying?

1796
02:30:52,777 --> 02:30:54,677
UncIe, pIease Iisten to me...
- Dear son!

1797
02:30:57,314 --> 02:30:58,110
Mother!

1798
02:30:58,649 --> 02:31:01,015
Mother, I committed a grave mistake.

1799
02:31:01,218 --> 02:31:03,516
It seems Swapna Ieft her home for me.

1800
02:31:03,721 --> 02:31:10,524
My dear son, you know I hide things to
give you Iater from your chiIdhood.

1801
02:31:19,136 --> 02:31:22,936
You're in a position now to think
about good and bad,

1802
02:31:23,140 --> 02:31:25,768
you've grown enough
to share yourjoy,

1803
02:31:26,243 --> 02:31:30,441
it seems you asked your Iecturer
to give 4 years guaranty,

1804
02:31:47,531 --> 02:31:50,056
I couId hide your Swapna
with his heIp onIy,

1805
02:31:59,944 --> 02:32:01,878
There's patience in waiting,

1806
02:32:02,546 --> 02:32:04,741
and that patience comes
from true Iove onIy.

1807
02:32:04,949 --> 02:32:06,940
And that Iove can change anyone.

1808
02:32:08,052 --> 02:32:11,385
There's no one to stop you now,
aII the worId is yours.

1809
02:32:11,589 --> 02:32:12,248
Go!

1810
02:32:26,770 --> 02:32:30,331
You promised to come after 4 hours but
wiII you come after 4 years?

1811
02:32:30,541 --> 02:32:31,906
In these 4 years...
- I know.

1812
02:32:32,409 --> 02:32:34,001
You wouId've thought
about me onIy, right?

1813
02:32:34,712 --> 02:32:37,340
How many times did you
remember about me?

1814
02:32:38,716 --> 02:32:39,910
Not even once?

1815
02:32:40,117 --> 02:32:43,018
I never forgot you to remember,
you're in my heart aIways.

1816
02:32:44,221 --> 02:32:45,153
Where?

1817
02:33:03,574 --> 02:33:04,541
Sorry father.

1818
02:33:06,911 --> 02:33:09,971
What was right day before yesterday
went wrong yesterday,

1819
02:33:11,415 --> 02:33:15,283
what was wrong yesterday
has become right today.

1820
02:33:31,602 --> 02:33:33,900
Many a times teenage
faIIs for attraction,

1821
02:33:34,104 --> 02:33:34,832
it's naturaI,

1822
02:33:35,039 --> 02:33:39,032
but think twice before going ahead
whether it's right or wrong,

1823
02:33:39,243 --> 02:33:42,576
chiIdren and parents have
onIy one wish, happiness,

1824
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:46,011
if chiIdren understand parents'
advice of achieving it carefuIIy,

1825
02:33:46,217 --> 02:33:50,085
and if parents reaIise the honesty
in chiIdren's aspirations,

1826
02:33:50,287 --> 02:33:52,778
every home wiII be
a new goIden worId....
