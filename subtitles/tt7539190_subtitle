177
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,040
Happily listening to music
when you are here to steal!

178
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,680
Didn't you get married
when you came here to work?

179
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,320
"Kissing just once isn't a crime"

180
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,920
"Flame of lamps-"

181
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,960
Why are you staring?

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,680
Making sure you took everything

183
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,280
All packed safe and sound

184
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
Drop me at home please

185
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,400
Aiyo! That blessed
old man has returned

186
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,640
Escaped, huh?

187
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,200
Where can you go?

188
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,280
I am Vikram Vishwanath

189
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,800
Managing Director of
Vikram Group of Companies

190
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,280
Vikram Imports Exports,
Vikram Garments, Textiles, Airways

191
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,640
All belong to me

192
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,880
Your good name?

193
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Christina

194
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,120
Wow! Nice name

195
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,120
- You...alone here?
- Yeah

196
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
I like to be

197
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,680
Awesome

198
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,000
I like to be with my friends

199
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,560
To enjoy life I don't mind
spending even a fortune

200
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,840
You know what?

201
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,120
Today is my birthday

202
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,880
Oh! Happy birthday

203
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,080
- Mr...?
-Vikram Vishwanath

204
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,400
You can call me Vicky

205
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,800
Actually I came here

206
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,200
To celebrate my birthday
with my friends

207
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,560
But I think after I met you
I should celebrate only with you

208
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,120
If I set my heart, I can do
anything for you in this world

209
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,160
Are you trying to hook up with me?

210
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,360
Yeah, of course

211
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,720
I want to

212
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,960
Christina, you haven't said anything

213
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
No way can you impress me

214
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,080
Why not?

215
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
- But I need some time
- Okay

216
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,040
One challenge

217
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,000
Between us?

218
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,880
What about a night drive?

219
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,960
I am going to Chennai

220
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,120
You can come with me

221
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,560
I will give you a few hours

222
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,720
But you can't impress me
I am 100% sure

223
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,320
I am game

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,800
'Minister's seaside bungalow
East Coast Road, Chennai'

225
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,600
Sir, you know very well
how to handle such cases

226
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,960
Madam, I have my own style of
solving even the toughest problem

227
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,440
But it won't work here

228
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,640
Now it's the minister's call

229
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,960
How did the News leak about
the boy's body in the railway track?

230
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,920
Our Army flat corruption

231
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
Gold mine corruption

232
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,360
He was the reporter who
publicized all our scams, sir

233
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,800
He is a real pain, sir

234
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,480
Keep a prompt reply ready

235
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,680
Did we get our hands dirty
in a routine rip-off?

236
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
If all this is brought to light,
not just me

237
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,680
All of you will be counting bars with me!

238
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,480
We sent our party men
to burn their huts

239
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,280
We denied strongly the News that
the girl's father committed suicide

240
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,120
If our link is leaked to the public...

241
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,640
...we can't run a Party

242
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,480
Only eat gruel in jail!

243
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,880
Elections are round the corner

244
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,320
Cover it up somehow

245
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,840
Leave this to me

246
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,280
(song from 'Payanangal Mudivadhillai')

247
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,640
I like this song very much

248
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,280
That too, I love the singer SPB

249
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,040
What a voice, sir!

250
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,680
Will you switch off the radio?

251
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,920
Sorry, sir

252
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,920
- Tell me
- 'Did you get the money?'

253
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,120
He said he doesn't have

254
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,480
'Did you refer my name?'

255
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,720
I did, no use

256
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,080
He gave me a 2 hour trip
to drive a customer instead

257
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,280
I'll get paid

258
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,440
So I took it up

259
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,400
Who the hell certified you as a driver?

260
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,080
Don't you know you can't
talk over the phone and drive?

261
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,880
Idiot! The word 'sorry'
is an easy way out

262
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,600
She won't even eat without me

263
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,640
- She'll be starving
- If we go home she'll come I'm sure

264
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,160
- Don't run, Charu
- I won't go home without Madhu

265
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,160
Hello, sir
What are you doing there?

266
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,640
Uncle! My sister is missing

267
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,000
Did you lodge a complaint?

268
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,360
Nothing to worry
I will take care

269
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,880
You will deal with it yourself?

270
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,680
It is a case of a missing person

271
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,600
Wait, I must interrogate you

272
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,800
- What is your name?
- Dileepan, sir

273
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,600
- Where do you work?
- I am a dubbing artiste

274
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
- What is your name, dear?
- Charumathi

275
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,080
- Your sister's name?
- Madhuvanthi

276
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
How old is she?

277
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
About 4 months old, sir

278
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,240
Then her mother must have taken her

279
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,640
Where is your mother, dear?

280
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,560
Mother...

281
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,920
Sorry, sir, my wife died 2 years ago

282
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,400
You're confusing me, baby

283
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,920
Do you have any photo?

284
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,960
Charu, why?
No need, don't show

285
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,960
She is just a child
She loves-

286
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,520
I thought as much right then

287
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,280
This was a whacko case

288
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,200
She is after all a kid, poor thing!

289
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,440
But shouldn't you know better?

290
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,400
So many out there come back
from work dog tired

291
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,320
Complaining about a missing dog!
Jobless or what?

292
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,800
Mr Police!

293
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,200
What?

294
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,640
Did you see a girl
without a sari go this way?

295
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,760
Without her sari?

296
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,080
Yes, she left behind this sari
and scooted with all my stuff

297
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,120
- Who?
- My wife Parvatham

298
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,640
- How old will she be?
- Nineteen

299
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,600
Why marry when you have
1 foot in your grave...

300
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,120
...and wander like a spirit?

301
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,280
Go back home

302
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,880
Look how diplomatically
he covers up his inadequacy

303
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,880
Is he a cop or a crook?

304
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,640
Brother, did you see her?

305
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,680
Oh! Sorry

306
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm not blind and she escaped
from right under my nose!

307
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,040
How can you help me?
Let me continue my hunt

308
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,320
- Sir?
- What?

309
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,280
Be careful when you go that side

310
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,080
There's a hole in the middle of the road

311
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,400
Look who's talking!

312
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,720
Take your father home in 1 piece, baby

313
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,520
As if I have never seen a ditch!

314
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,760
He's a fine one to advise me!

315
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,680
Awww! I fell into the hole

316
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,040
I think his whole body
fell into the hole!

317
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,640
What are you looking
in the mirror for?

318
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,880
- Nothing in particular
- Look at that

319
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,320
- Vettu, shall I ride the bike?
- No need

320
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,120
You look very weak and you'll ride
at snail's pace, let me ride

321
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,120
Even this bro is cycling slowly

322
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,440
You mean to say he's weak?

323
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,320
- Let's ask his girl!
- Stop, 1 minute

324
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,400
Bloody pipsqueaks!
He looks weak to you?

325
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,080
Lay a finger on him
You will know his strength then!

326
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,640
- Take out your knife
- I left it behind at home

327
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,800
Hey! Come here
Why argue with them?

328
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,320
Why do you want
to buy trouble?

329
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,640
Coward! Shame on you!

330
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,160
You forgot about our loot?

331
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,440
Don't you have any self-worth?

332
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,160
Hen-pecked fellow!
Stop, I say

333
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hey, come

334
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,600
You're a scaredy-cat for sure

335
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,680
Police!
Let's scoot

336
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,040
Hurry up

337
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,880
Let's go, quick

338
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,080
Go...go

339
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,240
Hello, Ram Singh

Hey, Chandrababu

341
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,680
Long time!
How about some tips for me?

342
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,160

from her caste react?

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,080
But will they keep quiet
if a person from their caste dies?

355
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,920
This is the reason for the riot, sir

356
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,760
This uprising was created by you
for your political gain

357
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,160
Everything was pre-planned

358
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,360
Your intelligence

359
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,840
Money and power

360
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,600
You've used your clout and changed
even the boy's postmortem report

361
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,880
To support this...

362
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,480
...I have video evidence of the people
involved in this, shot in a Spy Cam

363
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,520
All this was to protect
your position as minister, right?

364
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,280
Excuse me

365
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,680
Personal call

366
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,200
'Welcome, Radio City
This is your RJ Abhinaya'

367
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,360
'Muthukumar, you've registered for
'Little Thrill, Chillers Still' program

368
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,840
- 'Are you ready?'
- Oh yes! Moment I registered

369
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,960
'You can win a gold coin,
gift hamper or mobile'

370
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,480
- 'All the best for the 1st prize'
- I'll be happy with 3rd prize

371
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,800
I want that mobile-

372
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,960
'Good luck to get the mobile
which is the 3rd prize'

373
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,560
'What is your thrilling story?'

374
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,320
'Horror, Romance or is it Action?'

375
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,920
Subramani's story

376
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,840
In our village lived
a chap called Subramani

377
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,000
He had a younger sister

378
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,240
...mother and a friend
who had returned from abroad

379
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,520
One day that friend came
to our village on a leopard

380
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,440
- 'Leopard'?
- Jaguar car!

381
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,720
'For a second my heart stopped beating!'

382
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,400
He has passed only 3rd grade
and if he can drive a Jaguar...

383
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,720
...Subramani who graduated after
the 3rd attempt decided on that day

384
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,800
- 'What...?'
- He would also go abroad and earn

385
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,120
- Come to the same village on a horse
- 'On a horse?'?

386
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,560
I meant a Ferrari!

387
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,400
- 'Then?'
- Then what?

388
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,520
He left for Chennai
that very same night

389
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,680
He didn't go empty-handed

390
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,320
Then?

391
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Helped himself to his mother's jewelry,
sister's cash and left home

392
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,040
'Story is superb'

393
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,400
'But there isn't any twist in your story'

394
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
His iPad has all the incriminating videos

395
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,880
Did he give it to you?

396
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,480
'He isn't even accepting it'

397
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,800
He will surrender

398
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,080
Is it money or girl?

399
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,360
Ask him what he wants

400
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,600
- 'He will agree'
- What if he doesn't...?

401
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,600
As if I have to give you ideas?

402
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,400
Okay, I'll try

403
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,080
'We enjoyed the story of
Subramani and his lost wallet'

404
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,680
Who's the next caller in line?

405
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,960
Mr Saravanan

406
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,520
If this News leaks...

407
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,200
...many people will be affected

408
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
I mean college reputation

409
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,640
Minister's future

410
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,040
Give me your 2nd option

411
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,560
An entire village is burning in agony
because of this problem, madam

412
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,200
For the girl's father's suicide
and the boy's death

413
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,960
...only you are responsible

414
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
Unaware of this truth...

415
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,600
...those innocent folks
are resorting to violence

416
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,720
Listen

417
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,920
If you don't like the minister's offer
you suggest an option

418
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,640
Don't go to the Press or Media instead

419
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,320
If you decide to go...

420
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,920
...if a bullet from my gun is missing

421
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,840
...I'm not answerable to anyone

422
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,160
Sir, have you gone mad or what?

423
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,760
He's a journalist, right?

424
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,440
If you point a gun at him...?

425
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Why do you aggravate the problem?

426
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,840
Look, I came here
because you called me

427
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,640
If you threaten me by showing
your political clout and authority...

428
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,480
...I'm not the type to get scared

429
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,120
This meeting will also
turn into an evidence!

430
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,840
The number of innocent lives
you've sacrificed for your political votes

431
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,640
...I'll certainly publicize to the world

432
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,440
You reap what you sow!

433
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,840
If you represent the Press,
can you get away threatening us?

434
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,600
Hey! Come here

435
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,560
Throw him into the sea

436
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,680
Let him be a prey
at least to the fishes

437
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,120
- He's escaping!
- Nab him

438
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,840
Get him

439
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,080
Go fast, hurry

440
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,800
Follow him
Start the car

441
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,720
Sir, what happened?

442
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,840
Go to GV road

443
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,200
They are following our car

444
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,520
First take me to a safe place

445
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,760
- What are you looking for?
- My mobile

446
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,000
You can use mine, sir

447
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,720
Tell me the number

448
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,880
97

449
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,080
69

450
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,720
9795

451
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,880
Stop...!

452
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,840
Watch it

453
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,760
Follow him
Get him

454
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,240
Hey, come on
We'll catch him

455
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,840
I'm starving

456
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,200
Will you get 'biriyani'
from that eatery?

457
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,400
Bro, 1 'biriyani'

458
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,240
Hey! Pack up all the stuff

459
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,320
Isn't it getting late?

460
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,440
- You there! Pack up
- Almost done

461
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,960
What crap!

462
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,080
You heard madam?
Keep aside a leg piece

463
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,120
What about my clients who pay,
if they want a leg piece?

464
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,520
Your rule, huh?

465
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,880
I'll accuse you of child labor

466
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,160
- And put you behind bars
- This is for you, sir

467
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,240
You should be scared!

468
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,880
Hey you! Brown shirt

469
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,400
- Madam...?
- Come here

470
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,520
Who is she?

471
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,240
Husband and wife

472
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
Whose husband are you?
Whose wife is she?

473
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,360
We are going home after work

474
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,960
Pick up your food
and go home soon

475
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,560
- Thanks, madam
- Hey...!

476
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,920
Haven't you kept it aside?

477
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,560
Turn off the lights

478
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,280
Move...move

479
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,120
Greetings, madam

480
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,760
'We have been trying to reach Mr Muthukumar
but not succeeded as yet'

481
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,480
Ganesa, wash the plates

482
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,160
Bro...?

483
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,280
Did you see a girl go this way?

484
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
Girl...?

485
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,160
What is the matter?

486
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,960
She wanted me to help her

487
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,160
She had my bag and cycle
Now she's missing

488
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,480
You had money in the bag?

489
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,520
You look like someone
who works hard for his living

490
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,960
Now you've lost everything

491
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,040
She's probably an airplane party

492
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,240
That's why she flew away like a bird!

493
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,200
Let's go home, Charu

494
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,760
Charu, if you cry,
I'll feel like crying too

495
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,360
- Please, Charu
- All lies

496
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,520
My puppy is missing
and you're lying to me

497
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,680
Don't talk to me

498
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,080
Go away from here

499
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,160
Hey, Charu...?

500
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Who is it?

501
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,680
- I'm Doraemon, your favorite hero
- Where are you?

502
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,360
You were crying, right?

503
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,920
That's why you can't see me

504
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,240
If you stop crying, I'll give you
whatever you ask for

505
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,560
Anything...?

506
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,320
Sure, anything

507
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,160
- Our pup Madhu?
- She is in my house

508
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,320
I came to invite your dad
for a function at home

509
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,440
Your dad was very busy

510
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,200
So I brought the puppy with me

511
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,640
Puppy is the chief guest!

512
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,240
After the function gets over...

513
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,120
...I'll drop puppy home
safe and sound

514
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,440
Is that okay?

515
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
You go home with your dad

516
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,440
Charu...?

517
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,920
I feel sorry for your dad

518
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,360
Don't feel sorry
He's a cheater!

519
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,440
Doraemon...?

520
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,800
Doraemon?

521
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,800
- Where did Doraemon go?
- You're lying

522
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,200
Even I saw

523
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,040
What's the time now, Charu?

524
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,720
- '11:30'
- Oh my God!

525
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,960
Is it so late in the night?

526
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,680
Doraemon's bedtime

527
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,400
Let's both go home

528
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,720
Tomorrow Doraemon will drop
our puppy back home, okay?

529
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,960
- Go
- Where to?

530
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,040
Charu, don't go by yourself

531
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,200
Will your friends be okay
about you coming with me?

532
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,360
Big deal!

533
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,080
If you are loaded
friends will make a bee line

534
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,440
You know one thing?

535
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,160
Money is not just
an evil necessity

536
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,520
It can even show you Heaven

537
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,240
Oh! What a crazy guy!

538
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,960
My God, look at that!

539
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,720
That's some style, I say

540
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,600
What's wrong with you?
Are you mad?

541
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,080
Hey Vicky
What's up with you?

542
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,400
Let's first wait
Why are you turning?

543
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,920
My gawd!

544
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,400
Vicky!

545
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,400
'He has ruined my business'

546
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,560
Where did you come from,
bloody demon?

547
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,960
Stinky scoundrel!
Is this how you drive?

548
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,080
Does this road
belong to your father?

549
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,000
Mind your words
I'm Vikram Vishwanath

550
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,880
I own Vikram group of companies

551
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,120
My dad can actually buy this road
if he wants to, scumbags!

552
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,280
Damn you, rich bugger!

553
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,360
- I'll kill you
- Sorry...sorry

554
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,280
- Vicky, calm down
- Why are you apologizing?

555
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,880
Madam, ask him to pay
for all the damages

556
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,400
Find out how much

557
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,280
How much?

558
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,400
On the whole
loss is more than 10,000

559
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,040
How much for everything?

560
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,240
Arrogant fellow!

561
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,840
Who are they, sir?

562
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,880
Why are they after you?

563
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,680
Where should I drop you?

564
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,400
Sir...?

565
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,920
Sir...?

566
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,080
Sir...!

567
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,480
- RKS Travels
- Bro...?

568
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,000
There's a problem, bro

569
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,960
What is it?

570
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,360
The client in my car is dead!

571
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,400
- What are you saying?
- Yes, bro

572
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
'Did I give you a mortuary van?'

573
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,720
'You have a dead body?'

574
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,080
'Car isn't damaged, right?'

575
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,240
The car-

576
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,600
'You had better bring the car back
without anyone noticing it'

577
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,280
Hello...?

578
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,560
'Muthukumar, welcome to the 2nd round
of 'Little Thrill, Chillers Still' program'

579
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,320
'Are you there?
Hello...?'

580
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,800
Can you hear me?

581
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,120
'Hello...hello? '

582
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,120
'Loving brother'

583
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,440
'Obedient son'

584
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,240
'And 'Sincere' Subramani who will not
travel ticketless to his home town'

585
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,560
'His story has entered
the 2nd round in this contest'

586
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,720
'Congratulations, boss!'

587
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,560
'So your friend Subramani took up
a job as driver to pay his fare'

588
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,040
'Continue his story'

589
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,760
'Don't put up your price
Share your story with our listeners'

590
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,160
If the passenger with you
a while ago was suddenly killed...

591
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,560
- 'What...?'
- What state will you be in?

592
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,320
'It will be as thrilling
as our show title, boss'

593
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,240
Now he is also sailing in the same boat

594
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Come on...come on

595
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,600
Catch him

596
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,600
Come on, get in

597
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,960
Speed up

598
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,080
Hello...?

599
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,080
It's over, I'm on
my way back from Pondy

600
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,360
I'll call you once I reach there

601
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,160
Rishi...?

602
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,640
My battery is really low

603
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,800
Can I call you later?

604
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,320
Yeah, I'm travelling alone

605
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,040
Hey! Why did you lie?

606
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,840
I never said it's the truth

607
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,000
Liquor fuels romance, you know

608
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,240
Shall we try?

609
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,360
1 strong beer

610
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,760
Vodka with orange juice for you?

611
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,960
No...no, 1 vodka

612
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,320
Don't want it mixed?

613
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,560
Why...?

614
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,440
We'll click a selfie?

615
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,200
- Come, let's dance
- No, I'm not interested

616
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,200
What...?
Stay away

617
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,680
Thank you for the beer

618
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,520
"Lord of desire, Kama's breath breezed
scorching the wind as it teased"

619
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,880
"Sensual urges of desire
burst in my veins afire"

620
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:20,240
"When my fingertips caress you tonight
in raptures of deep delight"

621
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:27,720
"Without dawn breaking the sky above
tonight should lengthen, my love"

622
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,880
Baby, what are you doing here?

623
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,480
Is your puppy missing?

624
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,240
How will it help by sticking
a poster on a poster?

625
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,520
- Tomorrow they'll stick a new film poster
- Don't take it off

626
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,080
Will you come with me?

627
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,320
- Where to?
- I'll find your dog for you

628
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,520
'Subramani's passenger was killed'

629
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,960
'Muthukumar who shocked us
by sharing this is on the line'

630
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,840
'Then what happened to Subramani?'

631
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,360
What can I say, madam?

632
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,080
He's now caught in a situation
he never even dreamt of!

633
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,720
He's travelling with
a dead passenger he doesn't know

634
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,840
You rock, boss

635
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,240
Not knowing where to go
or what to do...

636
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,840
- I'm in a dilemma, madam
- Really...?

637
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,440
- Then...?
- Can I ask you something?

638
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,760
Sure, go ahead

639
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,960
If a person is in Subramani's shoes...

640
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,520
...will you help him?

641
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,080
Sure...we will

642
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,160
What I was narrating all along
was not Subramani's story, madam

643
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,080
'Then...?'

644
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,320
It is my story

645
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,960
What are you saying?

646
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,920
Please believe me, madam

647
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,240
Trust me

648
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,080
- Are you kidding?
- No, madam

649
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,080
Mr Muthukumar...?

650
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,880
What was that sound?

651
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,800
Hey! Come here

652
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,600
Bring that bag also

653
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,120
Where is your husband?

654
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,800
- He's your husband, right?
- Yes, madam

655
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,880
Where is he?

656
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,800
He has gone to buy 'biriyani' for me

657
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,240
What's in that bag?

658
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,360
Only old clothes, madam
Nothing else

659
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,840
Has he gone to Ambur to buy you 'biriyani'?

660
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,360
Gone to buy 'Ambur biriyani'

661
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,200
- Ouch!
- Runaway thief!

662
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,600
Will you die if you don't
watch TV just for a day?

663
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,960
Hey! How dare you
hit your wife in front of me

664
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,240
Yes, madam

665
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,120
He drinks, brings his mistress over
and beats me black and blue, madam

666
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,120
You got a mistress?

667
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,680
All that is crocodile tears, madam

668
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,560
Instead of cooking my dinner
she watches those soppy soaps on TV

669
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,080
Get up first

670
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,640
Stop crying and speak up

671
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,520
Gawd! Madam

672
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,600
He removed my wedding chain

673
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,640
And gifted it to
that other woman!

674
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,840
Drag him into our jeep

675
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,960
Come to the station
and file a complaint

676
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,120
I'll put him behind bars
in a dowry case

677
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,840
Don't do something drastic, madam

678
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,520
Even though now and then
he treats me badly...

679
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,040
...he genuinely loves our children

680
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,800
I'm not that bad, madam

681
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,080
Why are you changing
your tune all of a sudden?

682
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,480
Where do you live?

683
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,080
In Choolaimedu
Near Muniswaran temple

684
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,560
I'll drop you home
You get into the jeep

685
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,840
Get in

686
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,040
Come on

687
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,720
Sir, shall I get the bag?

688
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,120
He will find it heavy to carry

689
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,600
Give her the bag

690
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,000
'Radio city 91.1'

691
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,560
'In our ''Little Thrill, Chillers Still'
program tonight'

692
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,640
'Our caller is sharing his story
It's exciting at the same time thrilling'

693
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,480
'kumar from Tirunelveli'

694
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,440
'Until a while ago, he was narrating
the story of Subramani'

695
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,440
'Now he has given a sudden twist
by stating it is his own story'

696
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,960
'Judging by the noise around him
I feel it must be true'

697
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,760
'Shall we ask him
his present status?'

698
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,880
Mr Muthukumar, are you safe?
Hope there is no problem

699
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,320
'Oh! Good...good
Very good'

700
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,120
'Mr Muthukumar, how long
will you be on the run?'

701
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,400
'If you don't know
who is hounding you...'

702
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,440
...why don't you go to
the nearest police station?

703
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,280
'I am sure they will
help you, Mr Muthukumar'

704
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,040
'Dial 100, simple'

705
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,000
'Hello?'

706
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,080
'Mr Muthukumar
Are you there?'

707
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,080
'Hello...hello'

708
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,360
- Girl, at least is this your area?
- This is it, madam

709
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,360
Then why don't you get down?
Is it a temple procession?

710
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,880
My head is spinning, madam

711
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,920
You bet it will!

712
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,320
I've shown you the city at night
in my jeep, right?

713
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,280
Where is your house?

714
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,760
Madam, if we go straight
we will reach 2nd street

715
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:06,960
2nd house on the left
after a ditch, madam

716
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,840
Now you've made my head spin, girl

717
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,960
Hey! Come here

718
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,040
I realize now why
you're having an affair

719
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,120
- Such a crafty girl!
- Yes, madam

720
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,400
You are a fine one to agree!

721
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,680
Start leading a decent life

722
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,120
- What is your name?
- Chandrababu, madam

723
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,440
- Your name?
- Saroja Devi, madam

724
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,680
Wrong combination

725
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,120
If I ever see you both
roaming around at night...

726
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,280
...I'll give you 'knock knees' and
make you count bars, understood?

727
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,600
Yes, madam

728
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,920
Let's go, man

729
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,480
Give it to me, bloody thief

730
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,280
Think you're the commissioner?

731
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,040
I am not Brutus like you!

732
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,040
Look who's talking!!

733
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,880
Why did you tell her
we are married?

734
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,480
Think I'll marry such an ugly chap?

735
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,440
As if you'll get handsome hero Ajith?

736
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,360
- You bet he will
- Give it to me

737
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,240
- The old man who shot you will hound you
- As if you saw him shoot me!

738
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,120
Of course I saw him

739
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,680
Take this
Lock it up in a vault!

740
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,120
Sticker for your forehead
Hey girl! Wait

741
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,280
Give it to your fiancee

742
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,200
Stop, I say

743
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,400
You claimed he tied you up

744
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,880
How did you get these stickers?

745
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,040
That old man stuck it
on your forehead, huh?

746
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,800
If he had tried those tricks
he would have seen my nasty side

747
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,200
You're so spunky
How did you get caught?

748
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,720
As if I did!
'Kaja Beedi' got me into this mess

749
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,360
Who is that?

750
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
'Supposedly he drafted the perfect plan!'

751
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,320
Praise be to 'Bodyguard Deity'!

752
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,280
'I started as usual
with an invocation to God'

753
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,080
I'm back to stealing
after a long gap

754
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,840
Be merciful, dear Lord

755
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,680
Look at that!
Thief of hearts, Krsna!

756
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,640
Your antics are indeed a pleasure

757
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,200
'It was then I noticed'

758
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,760
Oh my goodness!

759
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,200
Thank you, my most favorite deity!

760
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,960
Am I offering you sweets?
Shut that mouth of yours!

761
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,360
Why didn't you leave after
stealing that entire loot?

762
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,240
'My bad time!'

763
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,040
That sounds like a funeral conch

764
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,600
Seems like a bad omen

765
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,240
'It was then I saw
the 'beedi' packet'

766
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,960
What the hell is this?

767
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,680
Cigar or cocaine?

768
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,680
Perfect sketch

769
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,840
Good job!

770
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,800
Is it Hotel Durbar Bhavan?

771
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,040
I'm calling from
Colonel Sethupathi's house

772
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,920
Please deliver 2 'masala dosa'
2 'sambar vada' and 2 cups coffee

773
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,280
2+2+2

774
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,280
A thief is here as my guest

775
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,720
He is tired after all the stealing

776
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,000
I've decided to honor him

777
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,000
Send it fast

778
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,040
I don't like to hunt
human beings, Mr Thief

779
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,440
I have kept hunting souvenirs here
Heads of lion, tiger, deer and kangaroo

780
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,560
I don't want to add your head
to my collection, Mr Thief

781
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,160
In addition to smoking 'beedis'...

782
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,080
...do you also use
snuff powder, Mr Thief?

783
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,800
You are sneezing
when I used the snuff, huh?!

784
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,720
Mr Thief, please come out of hiding

785
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,000
You can keep all the stolen items

786
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,880
Please don't harm me

787
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,880
Fine, you mixed cocaine in the cigars

788
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,560
Even in snuff powder, huh?

789
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,960
Bloody blind son of a gun!

790
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,280
Parvatham! You came back
to your beloved, huh?

791
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,640
Parvatham, my darling

792
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,360
What are you looking at?

793
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,480
Your beloved decking himself up, huh?

794
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,400
You died very young

795
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,400
That's why you are still so youthful

796
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,520
But having gone through the ups and downs
of life, I look slightly older than you

797
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,200
- What the hell do you want, man?
- To me?

798
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,360
Lip to lip kiss?

799
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,600
- Will you?
- Fat hopes!

800
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,160
I'll punch you on your nose

801
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,640
I'm not even your wife
and you dare ask to be kissed?

802
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,880
You used to say I don't
fulfill the duties of a husband!

803
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,600
Now you've changed your tune
and say you aren't my wife

804
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,320
You know something?

805
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,480
Tonight is our wedding night

806
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,760
You're saying it as
casually as 'good night'!

807
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,040
(song from 'Oli Vilakku')

808
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,440
"We are a couple newly married"

809
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,960
Do I deserve to be punished so harsh
for stepping in here to steal?

810
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,240
Call the police!
Let me surrender

811
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,280
- What now?
- I might cast an evil eye on your beauty!

812
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,960
God help me!
He is torturing me

813
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,800
Don't bring the roof down

814
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,720
People may accuse
your husband of being a lunatic

815
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,160
This has been my dream
for 30 long years

816
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,640
Let me buy a love-drug
and come back virile

817
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,280
Take the police for a royal ride

818
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,560
Don't spin your yarn with me

819
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,960
Bloody fool!
Give me the bag

820
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,320
Why should I?

821
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,920
I risked my life to steal

822
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,840
Just because you untied me and
offered a lift, I'll part with it, huh?

823
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,000
Get lost!

824
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,160
Hey! Stop

825
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,160
Sassy smartass!

826
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,280
How long will it take for me
to bash you and grab the bag?

827
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,480
I like that!
Try it

828
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,520
I dare you

829
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,200
I'll scream my throat hoarse
claiming you raped me

830
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,320
You think you can get away
with violence!

831
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,440
Hey stop

832
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,360
Drown in this water

833
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,960
- Hey! Vicky
- Get rid of your hangover

834
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,480
How can you drink till you puke?
They are all staring at you

835
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,680
You got me drunk and now
trying to clear my hangover?

836
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,320
Where did I keep it?

837
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,320
Did you see my purse?

838
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,440
No

839
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,520
Pccht! How did I misplace it?

840
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,120
Bloody drunkard!

841
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,440
Sir, pay us
I got to go

842
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,560
- Getting late for us
- I'm getting delayed too

843
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,280
I lost my wallet and my mobile

844
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,120
Don't bluff!

845
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,840
I own Vikram group of companies

846
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,400
Vikram Exports, Vikram Mills
Vikram Transports, the whole works

847
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,240
Baby, your dog will come back
wagging its tail however far it has gone

848
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,800
Take you father home carefully

849
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,560
- Okay, uncle
- See you

850
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,960
Thanks, uncle

851
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,920
Of late you are disobeying me a lot

852
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,040
You must go to school tomorrow
Charu, let's go home first

853
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,200
Give me my mobile

854
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,560
Let me call Jayabalan grandpa
and check if our pup-

855
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,000
Dad, our Madhu

856
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,080
Cha...Charu, that isn't our Madhu

857
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,840
Stay where you are
Wait for me

858
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,800
Where are you?

859
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,480
Charu...Charu?

860
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,360
Hold my hand, Charu

861
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,640
Charu, where are you going?

862
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,720
'Don't go there, Charu'

863
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,840
Charu, listen to me

864
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,200
Hello! Move to the kerb
Standing in the middle of the road!

865
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,680
- Move aside
- Sorry, sir

866
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,720
Go away!

867
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:48,400
"Waves in the sea search daily
edge of the shore tirelessly"

868
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:56,960
"Tears well up in the alcove of my eyes
as hours melt, still wandering helpless"

869
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,760
"A pup who showered
mother's love totally"

870
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,840
"Heaven blessed on
earth an angel for me"

871
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,760
"Even after my mother died
my friend, philosopher and guide"

872
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,120
"My pure white present
My petite crescent"

873
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,640
"Losing you, my face lost its glow"

874
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,040
"I searched for you high and low"

875
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,600
"My floral halo"

876
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:49,400
"Waves in the sea search daily
edge of the shore tirelessly"

877
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:57,880
"Tears well up in the alcove of my eyes
as hours melt, still wandering helpless"

878
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,240
Baby, whom are you looking for
at this time of night, huh?

879
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,400
My puppy

880
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,920
I know where it is
I'll show you, come

881
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,560
Get lost!
I'll thrash you

882
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,640
Let him go
I will take you

883
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,240
Come, baby
Trust me

884
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,080
Sorry, sir

885
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,600
Did you see a little girl here?

886
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,520
What? I don't understand

887
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,280
Where is my daughter?

888
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,240
You saw her here?

889
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,080
Right here, huh?
Charu...Charu?

890
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,520
Charu!

891
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,400
'Tell me, where are they?
Cough up the truth'

892
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,600
- Where are they?
- Sir

893
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,240
What?
Come inside

894
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,520
Sit down

895
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,880
Which area?

896
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,120
Yes, Ravi?

897
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,240
What is the case?

898
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,320
Sir, snatching case

899
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,080
Roughed up a college girl

900
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,440
- Which area?
- Pudhupettai boys

901
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,880
What happened to the girl?

902
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,760
She is in hospital
Critical condition

903
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,640
Then what about the other chap?

904
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,920
That chap was a temporary driver
He was on duty just for 3 hours

905
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,000
His passenger was murdered

906
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,360
He drove straight here,
with the dead body

907
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,560
I told you I'll be there soon
Trust me, I will

908
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,840
'Where are you now?'

909
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,840
Police statio-

910
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,320
No, railway station

911
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,840
'Doctor is saying
all kinds of stuff'

912
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,200
'I am scared
Come soon'

913
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,640
Okay, shall I hang up?

914
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,000
Who was on the phone?

915
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,240
Er...sister, sir

916
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,520
- Who are your family members?
- Sister and mother

917
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,920
Father is no more, sir

918
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,160
Hey Rathnam!

919
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,280
Let's go to the crime spot

920
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,480
Come with us
and show the spot

921
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,000
I must go to my hometown, sir

922
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,360
You can't budge an inch
You've come with a dead body

923
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,160
First show us the spot

924
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,120
Come along

925
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,160
If we get caught separately,
the police will loot us!

926
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,520
We are safe only if we walk
up to your place together

927
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,800
But 1 condition, don't try to
rub my back or smell my hair

928
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,880
No flirting

929
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,240
- Okay?
- As if I you'll let me

930
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,480
Wait here for a minute

931
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,760
Shall I hold the bag?

932
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,720
I can hold it
You just wait here

933
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,800
Hey! Don't peep

934
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,760
That old man bathed her
and decked her up!

935
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,680
What will I see
that he hasn't seen?

936
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,680
Akka, how could you
slap me so hard?

937
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,360
Hey! I will pickle you to pieces

938
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,760
Give the phone to my fiance

939
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,600
'She sounds furious
You talk to her'

940
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,720
Yes, sweety pie?
Are you mad at me?

941
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,160
How could you be scared
of the watchman, my dear?

942
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,600
He said he was a policeman!

943
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,320
You'll sketch a plan, that's it, huh?

944
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,600
You didn't land up on time

945
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,800
I somehow cajoled the chap
and brought him

946
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,160
All 3 of you messed it up

947
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,760
I told you, 'Bash him'
Why didn't you?

948
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,600
Now I am unable to get rid of him

949
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,440
He is planning to snatch our catch

950
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,160
Sweetie pie, what is your plan?

951
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,320
Who is with you?

952
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,280
Vettu, Noolu, Thulukkanam uncle and me

953
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,520
Got the knives ready?

954
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,600
Thulukkanam uncle did so long ago

955
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,680
I'll cleverly lure him
to Ekkaduthangal

956
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,640
When I reach the bridge, I'll ring
the cycle bell thrice as a signal

957
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,080
Knock him on his head

958
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,440
Close his chapter in a second

959
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,120
Okay? He might be eavesdropping now

960
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,640
I'll be there in ½ an hour

961
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,120
What is it, Babu?

962
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,280
You seem to be lost in thought

963
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,960
Wondering how to take
you home in 1 piece

964
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,880
1 piece for sure!
Come along

965
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,440
Where is my puppy, uncle?

966
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,600
Somewhere here

967
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,520
- Where, uncle?
- Found a case?

968
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,800
Sit down

969
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,040
Good girl, right?

970
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,800
You should do what I say, okay?

971
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,800
Sit down, sit here

972
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,360
He will bring the puppy

973
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,000
After he brings the puppy
we will all go meet your father

974
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,680
- Eat now
- Where is my puppy?

975
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,760
- We'll bring it, eat now
- I don't want

976
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,960
You must be hungry, eat

977
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,320
We will go once you have a bite

978
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,440
Give my bag

979
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,800
That's my dad's phone

980
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,240
- I'm not doing anything
- My dad is calling me

981
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,440
Give it to me

982
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,680
Hey! Go and make the child eat

983
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,720
This isn't your phone, baby

984
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,080
Mine, okay?

985
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:07,800
Hello?

986
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,000
No chance

987
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,000
What are you saying?

988
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,800
I won't accept that rate

989
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,200
Good piece, man

990
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,920
Discuss and call me back

991
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,760
Okay, I'll bring her

992
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,440
This phone is bugging me

993
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,200
- Hello!
- Charu?

994
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,320
Who is Charu?

995
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,560
'Who is this?'

996
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,840
Is Charu there?

997
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,920
No Charu here

998
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,480
- Hang up
- Who are you?

999
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,120
What happened, son?

1000
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,400
I spoke to your father, baby

1001
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,280
He is waiting for us

1002
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,360
Wear this dress first

1003
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,120
Then I will take you to your father

1004
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,600
I won't wear that dress

1005
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,840
Where is my puppy?

1006
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:54,800
Hello?

1007
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,920
Will I earn all through my life?

1008
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,120
Only you will

1009
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,520
I will be there in an hour

1010
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,280
Keep the cash ready

1011
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,440
Catch her

1012
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,520
Hey! Come out

1013
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,280
Sir is calling you

1014
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,680
What, man?

1015
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,480
You lost your wallet and so took up
a driver's job for a few hours

1016
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,080
You claim you never knew him

1017
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,480
Yes, sir

1018
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,800
- Cigarette?
- I gave up

1019
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,240
You reformed after
watching Mukesh's story, huh?

1020
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,600
Very good

1021
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,600
Did he tell you why and
who he was meeting?

1022
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,960
No, sir

1023
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,880
Did he contact anyone
after he was shot?

1024
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,840
No, sir

1025
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,840
He didn't tell you anything either

1026
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,720
I've been saying this
from the beginning, sir

1027
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,680
Why have you brought me here, sir?

1028
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,160
What do you take me for?

1029
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,040
Let's go

1030
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,040
Sir, that man is dead
Should show some respect

1031
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,520
(gun salute)

1032
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,000
Will this salute do?

1033
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,320
If you want me to respect a corpse
then why did you kill him?

1034
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,200
- You think I killed him?
- You did

1035
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,000
You killed him

1036
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,440
You have to agree, otherwise
you can't move from here

1037
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,080
Daddy...?

1038
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,280
Cha!!

1039
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,520
Go this way

1040
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,480
Hey stop!
I said, 'stop'

1041
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,440
Stop

1042
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,280
I'll kill-

1043
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,480
Sir, he isn't accepting

1044
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,120
Who is he to accept?

1045
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,000
I'll deal with him

1046
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,400
Madam, the journalist is dead

1047
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
- That iPad?
- Not with him now

1048
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,920
- We will find it
- The driver?

1049
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,880
- He is here
- Not just the iPad

1050
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,960
That driver is a witness

1051
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,960
Ensure there isn't any evidence, sir

1052
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,040
I'll take care

1053
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,560
Take him and search for the iPad

1054
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,680
Go along with him

1055
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,720
- It's here, sir
- What?

1056
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,040
- Where?
- Here, sir

1057
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,040
Come back

1058
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,320
Get him

1059
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,600
Let him go

1060
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,360
As if he can escape!

1061
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,760
This entire city is under my control

1062
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,000
He will definitely get caught

1063
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,920
This is going to be a long night

1064
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,280
We just have to 'Stay Awake'

1065
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,040
'After the break in Radio City'

1066
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,240
'I am your RJ Luv-Guru'

1067
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,440
Our program 'Little Thrill Chillers Still'
has become extremely exciting

1068
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,480
'Listening to Muthukumar's story
our RJ Abhinaya fainted'

1069
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,920
'We are unable to get Muthukumar on line,
as his number his switched off'

1070
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,720
'If someone tore the last
few pages in a murder mystery...'

1071
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,160
'...imagine the anti-climax'

1072
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,200
'Muthukumar has created such a stir
and vanished into thin air'

1073
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,960
'You may have a story even more
thrilling than what Muthukumar shared'

1074
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,560
Sir, may I come in?

1075
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,560
Come in

1076
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,680
Sir, you wanted me to
discontinue this program?

1077
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,960
- Have a seat
- Why did you stop me, sir?

1078
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Come on, Abhi

1079
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:32,040
Due to certain unavoidable
circumstances I had no choice

1080
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,240
Sir, please

1081
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,200
Madam, what do you know?

1082
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,320
He murdered his client and has escaped

1083
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,840
Don't you know it is an offense
to aid a criminal?

1084
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,400
What is the evidence?

1085
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,000
That is none of your business

1086
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,240
Of course it's my business

1087
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,040
And sir, you stay out of it

1088
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,120
Abhi, wait

1089
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,720
He isn't the killer
Fine, he is innocent

1090
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,800
How do we prove this?

1091
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,280
Sir, please

1092
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,600
Abhi, this is a serious situation here

1093
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,960
No other option than
dropping him from this program

1094
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,280
(song from 'Ninaippadhai Mudippavan')

1095
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,080
- Sorry
- Who is that?

1096
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,720
Want a ride?

1097
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,840
Er...yes

1098
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,680
Please wait

1099
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,400
My bones are all aching

1100
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,800
I'll just take my medication!

1101
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,800
Okay

1102
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,800
Where do you want to go?

1103
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,040
Er...uh...my daughter is missing

1104
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,480
She's a kid

1105
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,400
Will you come, I must look
for her in a couple of places?

1106
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,120
- Let's go
- Thanks

1107
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,480
Where is your house?

1108
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,880
We've been walking nonstop

1109
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,200
Hey! I am asking you

1110
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,800
Can't you see I am searching?

1111
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,520
Your house or somebody else?

1112
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,240
Only my house!

1113
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,560
Selling salt to the sea, huh?
Trying to trick me of all people!

1114
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,880
You poor thing! Came running
as soon as you saw me, huh?

1115
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,840
Shall I take you home?

1116
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,440
My sweetie-pie
My precious pet!

1117
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,680
My little treasure
Sparkling diamond!

1118
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,920
Dog looks cute, right?

1119
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,040
Even I would like to
take it home with me

1120
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,040
But I already have
a litter of pups

1121
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,280
Inauspicious month!
Why risk it?

1122
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,600
Will you get me wrong
if I say something?

1123
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,640
What?

1124
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,680
After my Myna...

1125
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,880
...you are the only one
who has stolen my heart

1126
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:39,880
I will keep this bell
as a souvenir of our meeting

1127
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,160
You take the pup home

1128
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,000
Stop playing this bell-game with me

1129
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,040
Even from 100 feet any fool
can guess this is a diamond ring

1130
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,720
Your tricks won't work with me

1131
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,880
Find someone else

1132
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,840
Chandrababu aspires
for Saroja Devi it seems!

1133
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,640
Shit!

1134
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,160
What the hell!

1135
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,720
What bad timing

1136
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,960
- What happened?
- How the hell do I know?

1137
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,720
Listen! I have to
get there on time

1138
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,480
- I need to be there
- I'll do something

1139
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,320
- Give me your phone
- For what?

1140
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,480
You have to sleep here
otherwise, is it okay?

1141
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,680
Give me your phone

1142
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,160
Bugging me with questions

1143
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,880
Please do something fast

1144
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,400
Wait...wait
Relax

1145
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,480
Whom are you calling?

1146
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,600
What happened now?

1147
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,640
Phone is dead

1148
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,400
Okay, come on
Give me your charger

1149
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,480
Shit!

1150
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,720
Wait, I'll just come

1151
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,560
Where are you going?

1152
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,720
To see Mukesh Ambani
Want to come?

1153
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,600
Hey idiot!

1154
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,840
Your car will also breakdown, moron

1155
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,200
Yellow board scoundrel!

1156
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,200
- 'Hello'
- Yes, Kalai

1157
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,600
- 'Where are you now, brother?'
- I am on the way

1158
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,040
'Why are you out of breath?'

1159
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,160
Nothing serious

1160
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,920
My friend met with an accident

1161
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,520
'Whaaat?!
Accident?'

1162
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,200
For my friend, not me

1163
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,200
- 'Come soon, anna'
- I'll see you soon

1164
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,640
- Hello?
- 'Muthukumar, I am Abhinaya'

1165
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,040
Madam, is that you?

1166
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,760
Yes, where are you now?

1167
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,000
In the police station?

1168
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,640
It's a miracle I am alive, madam

1169
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,960
You told me to go to the police station

1170
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,280
They are hand in glove with the culprits

1171
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,640
I am aware, Muthukumar

1172
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,680
Don't worry

1173
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,280
I want to see you
Where are you?

1174
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,080
Please! Don't chase me

1175
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,960
I am the only male member in my family

1176
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,920
'What happened?'

1177
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,800
'Listen carefully!
I'm not chasing you'

1178
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,400
'But the police officers are'

1179
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,240
They are trying to frame this on you

1180
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,640
'They want to make you the accused
and pin the murder on you'

1181
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,120
I haven't done anything, madam

1182
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,840
'But how will you prove it?'

1183
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,000
'Press and Media will
publicize your photo'

1184
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,560
There isn't a way out for you

1185
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,240
'They are looking for something'

1186
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,720
...which is with you or in the car

1187
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,280
'Either they get it or
it has to reach the right person'

1188
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,200
'Till then they will chase you'

1189
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,480
You are a witness
So they might even kill you

1190
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,000
'This is the crux of the matter'

1191
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,520
Now try to redeem yourself

1192
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,280
It's your call!

1193
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:08,320
"The mighty few slaughter
the innocent ones who are weaker"

1194
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:12,160
"Do the mighty kings think royally
they can rule over us eternally?"

1195
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:16,120
"No longer will waiting help our cause
Wake up now o' Thamizha, support us"

1196
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:20,240
"Waiting will make our dreams dissolve
O' son of our soil, now rise to resolve"

1197
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,960
"Take to the sword that slays
so cruel acts of tyrants end; fear allays"

1198
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,920
"Take to the sword that kills
so cruel acts come to a standstill"

1199
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,960
"You are like a tiger living in the cave
O' Thamizha, rich values you have"

1200
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,480
"No longer will waiting help our cause
Wake up now o' Thamizha, support us"

1201
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,960
"I am a tiger in a cow's clothing"

1202
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,440
"Under a cow's skin,
I am a tiger hiding"

1203
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,480
"Shoulders you lift
Let your face be lit"

1204
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,560
"Moustache you twirl
Let it point up and curl"

1205
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,520
"Let ones who derided you tremble in fear"

1206
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,520
"Pounce like a tiger
Unleash your anger"

1207
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,680
"Door has been opened of the iron chamber"

1208
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:14,360
"Spring out like a panther
Show them you're the master"

1209
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,000
"Don't hesitate hereafter"

1210
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,760
Hey! Police
Run...quick

1211
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,280
Stop!

1212
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,400
"Heart as joyful as the flower's hue"

1213
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,400
In a way all of us are blind

1214
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,400
I can't see beyond 500 feet

1215
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,080
You can't see
at close quarters

1216
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,400
Distance is the only difference

1217
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,920
My son said he would
buy me an auto rickshaw

1218
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,960
Why do I need one?

1219
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,880
I'm happy with this
given by our MGR!

1220
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,920
I refused to give it up
or sell this either

1221
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,520
By the way, where did you say
you lost your child?

1222
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,880
Don't worry

1223
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,480
You'll find your child

1224
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,560
Hey! Vicky

1225
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,000
Where are you taking me?

1226
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:03,600
"Peep through a magnifying glass sleazily"

1227
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:10,400
"Look what job this lass is up to busily
peep through a magnifying glass sleazily"

1228
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,280
Excuse me

1229
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,800
I want to charge my mobile

1230
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,400
Only 1 plug point is available

1231
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,120
A mobile is already being charged

1232
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,480
Please go, sir

1233
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,160
"My sister's son is happy-go-lucky
Had a fling with a married Ms Turkey"

1234
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,040
"Poor soul! Her husband is so sickly"

1235
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,320
"Look what job this lady is up to busily"

1236
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,920
What the hell, Vicky?

1237
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,040
- Hold on
- What is your plan?

1238
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,800
- Vicky!
- I am okay

1239
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,440
Bro, your phone was being charged?

1240
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,160
You came to charge your phone?

1241
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,240
- What's that noise?
- Great timing, I swear

1242
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,360
Your husband is coming

1243
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,400
Help! Thief!!

1244
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,960
A thief has entered my house

1245
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,480
Bloody witch!
Got me caught after having fun!

1246
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,320
He is running away
Come soon

1247
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,800
- Let's run
- He is escaping

1248
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,760
How many Good Samaritans will chase me!

1249
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,880
I am not a thief
I am Vikram Vishwanath

1250
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,720
I own Vikram group of companies

1251
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,600
Most important to clarify
at this juncture

1252
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,680
Hello!

1253
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,160
Where are you exactly?

1254
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,320
Near Alandur Aasife Briyani shop

1255
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,760
'Come soon, I am scared'

1256
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,160
Hide in a safe place
I'll give you instructions

1257
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,880
- Yes, Abhi
- Uncle, where are you?

1258
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:35,400
We traced his mobile signal
to the church in CK road

1259
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,720
Radio jockey's mobile signal
is approaching in the same road

1260
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,200
Hey! You there
Old man

1261
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,280
Did you see a girl
in a school uniform?

1262
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,160
Bloody ass! Stop

1263
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,120
Stop right there
Where is the child?

1264
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,840
- Let go of me
- Where is the child?

1265
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,560
- I will bash you
- Try hitting me

1266
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,960
He has kidnapped our child

1267
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,400
- Scumbag, where is she?
- Take your hands off

1268
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,800
Hey, where is my girl?

1269
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,680
- Which girl?
- Where is Charu?

1270
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,920
Give back my mobile

1271
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,400
My daughter will call me

1272
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,800
Take this watch instead

1273
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,920
It is more expensive
than the mobile

1274
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,200
- Costly, huh?
- Yes

1275
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,080
What are you doing?

1276
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,680
Let me go

1277
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,680
- Let go of me
- Where is my child?

1278
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,200
Where is my daughter?

1279
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,080
What did you do to her?

1280
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,760
- Let go, you scum
- Give my phone back

1281
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,440
Can't you hear me?
Let go of me

1282
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,040
Beat him to a pulp

1283
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,120
Where is my daughter?
What did you do?

1284
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,600
Smash his head

1285
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,880
Bash him

1286
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,760
Hey old man!
Setting him up to hit me?!

1287
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,040
Wait, I'll get my boys

1288
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,400
Go away, jobless jerk

1289
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,800
You will get killed in an accident

1290
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,600
Come on, son, he will die
in a road accident for sure

1291
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,840
Let's go

1292
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,160
We tracked his mobile signal
to this building, sir

1293
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,800
I can see someone
run inside the church, sir

1294
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,640
Yov! Switch on the light

1295
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,240
Search over there

1296
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,120
Traffic constable, what a surprise!

1297
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,800
You don't have any work here

1298
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,360
I saw your car while patrolling

1299
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,560
So I came to see you

1300
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,880
Came to see me?

1301
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,680
Now that you have
you can leave

1302
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,520
- Go
- Okay, sir

1303
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,600
Sir, we searched
every nook and cranny

1304
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,120
He isn't hiding here, sir

1305
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,840
Let's go

1306
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,160
(mobile ringtone)

1307
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,440
What is the password?

1308
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,520
I don't know, sir

1309
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,840
He must have told you

1310
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,720
Come in, God's messenger!

1311
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,600
Sir, I know this boy

1312
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,680
I need to interrogate him

1313
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,280
Sir, I'll myself bring him in
for interrogation tomorrow

1314
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,720
Are you teaching ME
rules of crime enquiry?

1315
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,160
I know about the crime
as well as your enquiry mode

1316
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,880
Please send him with me, sir

1317
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,280
Come with me

1318
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,200
Sir, that iPad...?

1319
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,960
Are you mad? You don't
know how vicious he can be

1320
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,560
Take the next bus back home

1321
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,440
Sir, I went to all this trouble
only for the iPad

1322
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,840
Bro, you left your bag behind?

1323
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,480
Don't you want it?

1324
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,560
Catch it

1325
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,040
Doesn't matter if you don't
tell me the password

1326
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,400
We can figure it out

1327
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,560
But we can't let you go scot-free

1328
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,320
Pandiya

1329
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,040
Sir, don't commit this sin

1330
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,960
You'll have to face the consequences

1331
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,920
Lad, you go

1332
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,000
We don't believe in sin and salvation

1333
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,960
Hey rowdy
Take your gun

1334
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,080
He shot one of our men
with his illegal gun

1335
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,920
We witnessed the crime

1336
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,840
When we own a licensed gun
how will we retaliate?

1337
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,360
No sir!

1338
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,560
Go

1339
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,920
Pandiyan, search over there

1340
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,240
Sir!

1341
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,640
Sir, get up

1342
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,000
Sir, get up

1343
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,640
iPad...iPad

1344
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,600
Will you keep talking on the phone
or make me also a heroine?

1345
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,640
Yak yak on the phone
and mess up dialogs!

1346
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,200
- Brother
- What?

1347
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,560
- Name of the film?
- 'Vallavanukae Vallavan'

1348
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,600
Who is the hero?

1349
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,280
TR, now don't disturb us

1350
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,480
- TR...?
- Did I hear him right?!

1351
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,320
Leader of the women clan!

1352
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,760
"Come, my glam doll dear
Don't act pricey here"

1353

you don't request me"

Don't sign out, darling"

1364

Change the style, people

1385
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,880
Rock it!

1386
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,360
Make it big!

1387
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,280
It's a nightmare!

1388
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,480
Hello, Mr Vikram Vishwanath

1389
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,160
You must insert a coin
if you want to talk

1390
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Don't act smart

1391
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,160
Give me a coin

1392
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,120
Excuse me

1393
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,840
Boss, I'm Vikram Vishwa-

1394
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,800
Actually I need to make a call

1395
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,760
If you can spare me a coin-

1396
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,240
Your money, boss

1397
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,480
Tomorrow I'll send it back
through my driver

1398
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,760
- Thanks, boss, we are friends now
- No mention

1399
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,920
Don't repeat, boss

1400
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,440
1st time I'm seeing a rich man
begging from a tramp

1401
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,000
- Hey, Karthik
- Who is it?

1402
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,320
Hello, Karthik?

1403
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,640
'Whose number is this?'

1404
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,360
Hello...hello, Karthik?

1405
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,680
Suchi, just check
Some unknown number

1406
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,040
'Hey! It's Vicky'

1407
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,360
'Karthik, can you hear me?'

1408
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,400
Karthik, Vicky here

1409
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,800
Can you hear me?

1410
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,560
Bad luck...!

1411
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,720
What happened?

1412
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,120
She dances with no inhibitions at all

1413
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,720
You acted pricey
for 1 single autograph!

1414
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,840
Now I'm busy

1415
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,360
Kind of suits me

1416
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,000
- Saroja...?
- Huh...?

1417
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:24,440
Do you have any idea of all this
you are decking yourself with?

1418
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,160
Once a week I'll go
to steal only cosmetics

1419
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,240
Why am I not surprised!

1420
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,880
By the way, Saroja

1421
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,920
Why don't you act in films?

1422
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,040
With all this loot
you can become a celebrity

1423
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,120
Then if you join
a political party of your caste

1424
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,560
...you can become a politician

1425
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,720
Then if you go up north...

1426
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,440
...you can steal millions

1427
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,160
You can settle down in life

1428
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,400
I'll be eating gruel in Tihar jail

1429
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,640
Don't be silly, Saroja

1430
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,080
You think Tihar jail
is for petty thieves?

1431
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,920
It's a different world
Different life

1432
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,760
When you come out
you'll be covered in garlands

1433
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,920
They will burst fireworks
and celebrate your freedom

1434
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,680
Why are you looking at me dazed?

1435
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,480
Someone who grazes donkeys...

1436
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,240
...is so brainy

1437
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,240
Otherwise can't manage you, right?

1438
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,240
I agree that's quite a brainwave

1439
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,480
I'll be the heroine

1440
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,480
Who will be the hero?

1441
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,680
I am the hero

1442
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,960
He is the villain

1443
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,240
What, man?

1444
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,080
Do you think I won't shoot?

1445
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,440
Parvatham...?

1446
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,960
Please ask him to be
frightened of me

1447
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,120
Chandrababu

1448
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,080
He's holding the gun right, just run

1449
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,680
He pushed me down, fool!

1450
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,480
He's a drug addict
He'll shoot haphazardly

1451
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,800
- Quick
- Come fast

1452
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,440
If I keep calling your name
it will be a give away

1453
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,360
So I'll come quietly and grab you
by the scruff of your collar

1454
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,000
Why are you getting on to the truck?

1455
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,600
I have a good reason, I'll tell you

1456
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,000
Climb up

1457
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,760
Give me the bag
Give it to me

1458
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,760
Saroja, come up

1459
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,400
I won't spare you

1460
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,720
You have an union to lure
married women with expertise

1461
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,400
Poor Tamil Nadu!

1462
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,520
Wretched fellow

1463
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:00,840
Hey, fraud...!

1464
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,320
You married me
knowing I am old!

1465
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,120
You never let me touch you
saying you'll lose your beauty

1466
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,080
Beauty enhances
only by touch and kiss

1467
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,360
Don't scream

1468
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,760
Don't shout

1469
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,880
I won't hurt you, please

1470
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,160
Please

1471
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:13,280
My dad won't go
anywhere without me

1472
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,400
He cannot see, he is blind

1473
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,760
I want to go back to my dad

1474
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,920
Don't cry

1475
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,440
Your father will be safe

1476
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,000
I'm here for you

1477
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,640
Sit down

1478
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,920
Stay here, okay?

1479
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,360
Sit down

1480
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,200
You stay right here

1481
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,480
I'll go and find your dad

1482
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:49,600
Till then don't go anywhere

1483
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,120
Sit here, I'll be back

1484
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,800
- Madam, this is Muthukumar here
- 'What happened?'

1485
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,840
- Can you help me?
- 'Sure, tell me'

1486
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,520
'What should I do?'

1487
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,520
What's this road block?

1488
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,240
4 broken barrels are standing
in mid-road with their lids open!

1489
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,960
Where are you taking
my boss's fiancee?

1490
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,120
What do you say, bro?

1491
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,040
Will you always turn up late, my dear?

1492
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,120
He's your fiance?!

1493
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,480
She is my wife Parvatham
How can you be her fiance?

1494
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:27,880
Weapons...!

1495
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,200
I'll take out my gun,
father of all these weapons

1496
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:31,160
Hey...!

1497
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,000
B...C...!!

1498
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,240
That gun has no bullets

1499
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,840
Get your knives

1500
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,120
Good Lord! You said the gun
had no bullets, you lied?

1501
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,600
See how I hit the bull's eye!

1502
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:43,920
He shot the tyre

1503
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,520
ATTAAAACK!

1504
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,320
Aren't you fighting
for that damn bag?

1505
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,880
Take the bag
and send the girl

1506
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,120
Hey, who's this new guy in the race?

1507
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,160
He isn't her boyfriend
He is our villain

1508
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,880
What do think of yourself?
I've been a silent spectator

1509
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,480
Are you my husband?

1510
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,520
You look 25% like a bear!

1511
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,200
Who are you?
His stooge, huh?

1512
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,280
Why are you laughing?

1513
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,120
You are 75% of a gorilla

1514
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,760
Am I your wife?

1515
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,280
I'll pickle you to pieces

1516
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,480
What's tickling you?

1517
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,680
What's so funny?

1518
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,760
You throw the bag,
does it make you a hero?

1519
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,040
- If I hit you
- Go back

1520
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,960
I told you to plan a robbery and
you'll set me up for marriage!

1521
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:25,960
Scoot

1522
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,200
Clear out
Here's the bag

1523
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,600
- What wedding mania!
- She escaped

1524
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:33,760
'I am your Radio City Love-Guru
talking to you on this festive day'

1525
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:38,000
'A little while ago one of our listeners
had updated about a missing child'

1526
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,640
'That child is in her school uniform'

1527
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,520
'She is in a red and white
checked pinafore and blouse'

1528
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,880
'That girl's father is visually impaired'

1529
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,280
'She is safe now...'

1530
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,640
'...at Muniswaran temple
near Burma colony'

1531
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,200
Please increase the volume

1532
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,120
Sir, quiet
Let me listen

1533
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,400
What happened, bro?

1534
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:56,680
'We've also informed the police booth
Radio City team is heading there'

1535
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,760
'The girl's father is visually impaired
and she is in her school uniform'

1536
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,320
'We're aware of only these details'

1537
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,120
'Radio City is trying to get
that child safely to her father'

1538
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,600
That's my daughter

1539
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,080
He is talking about Charu

1540
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,800
- Yes, let's go check
- Do you know that place?

1541
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,920
- Shouldn't spare them
- Wait, bro

1542
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,200
Okay, sir

1543
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:15,200
Over...!

1544
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,800
How did you go in?

1545
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,040
Ask the chap who must have
taken a bribe to open the subway

1546
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,840
Ravi, check who is inside

1547
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,560
No one here, sir

1548
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,800
You know who the police
are looking for now

1549
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:54,960
Wait

1550
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:58,800
You there! Stop
Deaf or what?

1551
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,560
Didn't I tell you to stop?

1552
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,080
- What is in that bag?
- Nothing, bro

1553
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,360
Take out the money

1554
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,680
I have no money on me

1555
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,880
- Take it out
- Sshhh! The police might hear

1556
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,120
(overlap of angry voices)

1557
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,480
There's nothing

1558
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,520
- Give us your money
- Don't yell please

1559
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,600
- Police
- We know that

1560
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:18,760
Take off your shirt

1561
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,400
Obey his order

1562
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,720
What's in your pant pocket?

1563
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,200
- Nothing
- Give it

1564
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,680
Give us the bag

1565
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,360
Bro, jackpot
There's an iPad

1566
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,440
Give me the bag
That iPad is not mine

1567
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,720
Please, bro

1568
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,360
He has a gun

1569
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,800
Toy gun, right?

1570
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,840
Run...run

1571
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,440
Run, bro

1572
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:35,360
Come

1573
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,560
See if he has grabbed
anything from him

1574
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,720
I'm so tired, Vicky

1575
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,560
I can't drive anymore

1576
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,000
I've never been covered
even by a speck of dust

1577
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,360
But today thanks to you,
I'm roaming on the road

1578
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,880
...with worn out shoes
I'm pushing the car

1579
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,840
That's life, Mr Vikram Vishwanath

1580
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,960
If you want your dreams to come true...

1581
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,960
...you should sacrifice a lot!

1582
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,560
Yes, it's all my fate!

1583
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,960
What an experience!
That too, on my birthday

1584
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,160
Wonder what else
is in store for me!

1585
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,720
Hey Vicky!

1586
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,720
Vicky?

1587
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,400
Hey...?

1588
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,800
What are you doing?

1589
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,640
I thought you'll run away with the bag

1590
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:52,880
How can I abandon you?

1591
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,920
Only after I get you home safe, I'll go

1592
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,280
- Wow!
- I have my protocol even if I'm a thief

1593
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:58,320
What concern!

1594
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,560
At least now will you tell me
the right address?

1595
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,040
Intend asking for my hand, huh?

1596
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:04,280
Why not?

1597
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:08,360
Without my puppy
I won't come home

1598
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,840
You can go if you want

1599
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,880
If they had not announced
over the radio, imagine your plight!

1600
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,200
I can't even think about it

1601
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,520
On top of it, you are
being so damn stubborn

1602
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:17,840
I won't let go of you

1603
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,560
You have to be with me all the time

1604
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,320
Dad, did you hear that?
Madhu's bell?

1605
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,480
Untie me, dad

1606
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,040
- Madhu, dad
- No, Charu

1607
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,720
Dad, I know
Our Madhu

1608
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,600
Will you untie this?

1609
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,280
Wait, I'll come with you

1610
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,920
No need to untie this
I'll come along

1611
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,880
Let's go together...Charu!

1612
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,080
Stop...!

1613
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:43,360
Charu...?

1614
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,320
What did you do to my puppy?

1615
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:52,360
You killed my pup and
threw it in the canal?

1616
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,760
Baby, you might even accuse us
of being a kidnapper and killer

1617
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:58,840
- Whom are you talking to?
- We are not so ruthless

1618
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,000
Hear me out, sir

1619
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:03,760
That puppy's collar
has my wedding ring

1620
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:06,200
That's the only souvenir
of my wife we have

1621
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,280
I would really appreciate it
if you return it

1622
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,800
Here, keep the ring

1623
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,280
Sir, but we don't know
where the puppy is

1624
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,600
You can keep it

1625
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,160
Where is our puppy?

1626
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:22,480
We didn't harm
your puppy, baby

1627
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,240
Take your child home safely, sir

1628
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:27,280
Sir, please tell us
where our puppy is

1629
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:28,840
- Let go, sir
- We don't know, sir

1630
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,640
Please tell us and then go

1631
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,960
(overlap of angry voices)

1632
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:37,840
- Where did you find this collar?
- We found it on the road

1633
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,280
Daddy...!

1634
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:42,680
DAD!

1635
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,240
Stop the vehicle!

1636
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,760
Why did you ask me
to stop the car?

1637
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,200
If scumbags rush across
they are bound to get hurt

1638
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,440
How dare you say
something like that?

1639
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,600
Reverse the car

1640
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,800
Dad, nothing happened to you, right?

1641
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,960
Charu, you're fine, right?

1642
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,840
Take him to the hospital

1643
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:02,640
Here's your cane, dad

1644
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,480
Go to the hospital

1645
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,600
- Charu?
- Sorry, sir

1646
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,680
Let's go

1647
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:09,840
That same fatso police

1648
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:12,280
Hey! Soppy Soap viewer
Not yet gone home?

1649
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,600
Aiyo! Bleeding profusely

1650
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:15,280
Must rush him to the hospital

1651
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,720
Get in, fast

1652
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,280
Bro, please get in

1653
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,360
- Bleeding heavily
- Drive fast, start

1654
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,320
Start the car, Vicky
Let's go to the hospital

1655
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,600
- No one is telling me anything
- Go fast

1656
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:33,560
'I said, no need'

1657
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,520
'Why keep asking me
if you'll pick me up?'

1658
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,760
'Why should I be scared?'
I can take an auto

1659
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,080
- Who is this?
- I'll be home soon

1660
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,920
Parvatham...?

1661
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,480
- Parvatham
- Pick me up, dear

1662
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,360
Even if you keep changing your face,
my love for you will never change

1663
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,480
I'll immediately ensure we have kids
and my lineage flourishes

1664
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,520
I swear this on my mother

1665
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:12,880
Turn left

1666
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:14,320
Go, I say

1667
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,320
Don't be scared

1668
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,720
Drive carefully

1669
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,520
Hey! Rascal

1670
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,040
You dare point a gun at me!

1671
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:20,320
Do you know who I am?

1672
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,200
Smash his face

1673
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:23,720
Let go of me

1674
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,080
Scoundrel...!

1675
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:28,600
Drag him in

1676
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,480
Are you a big-time rowdy?

1677
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:32,520
Give me the bag

1678
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,720
I'll shoot you

1679
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,680
Listen to me, I didn't
do anything wrong

1680
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,040
Yov! He's lying

1681
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:39,320
- Shoot him
- If I shoot, your brain will scatter

1682
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,960
Shoot, I say
Pull the trigger

1683
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,920
Let go
Shoot...!

1684
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,480
There are no bullets in that

1685
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,480
Hear me out now

1686
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:52,920
Please allow me to talk

1687
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:56,360
Listen to me

1688
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:57,720
Please

1689
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,600
My mother means the world to me

1690
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:19,000
Just because some stranger
pick-pocketed my wallet

1691
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,280
...I'm on the run now

1692
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:24,800
Brother

1693
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,640
Don't worry, your mother
and sister will be fine

1694
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:29,760
You thought of helping
a helpless child

1695
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,600
I'm sure you are innocent

1696
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,360
To ensure you reach
your hometown

1697
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,360
...we'll do whatever help we can

1698
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,760
- Madam, tell me
- Did you nab him?

1699
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:16,840
Will you get him before dawn?

1700
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,040
Madam, this involves
my prestige too

1701
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,240
Minister is on the other line

1702
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:21,280
Speak to him

1703
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,480
What is the problem?

1704
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,280
You want this News to leak
and for me to go behind bars!

1705
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,440
What are you saying?

1706
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:29,880
Sir, he's somewhere around this place

1707
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,680
But so damn evasive

1708
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,240
Someone is helping him

1709
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,840
Shut up, useless son of a gun!

1710
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,880
Don't make me cuss you

1711
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,080
Listen

1712
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:43,360
Before sunrise, I don't want
any eyewitness to be alive

1713
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:46,400
Even if it is a mongrel
on the street shoot it down!

1714
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:47,520
Do you get it?

1715
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,400
Okay, sir

1716
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,480
None of them will be alive

1717
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:52,920
I'll take care

1718
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,960
I am responsible for all these events

1719
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:01,200
But it wasn't intentional, right?

1720
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:10,000
Let's try one last time, Vicky

1721
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,240
It's impossible!

1722
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,760
Without the password no chance

1723
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,280
Let's get out of here

1724
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,520
All we can do is reset it

1725
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,440
But if we reset,
data will get erased

1726
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:21,920
- Sorry
- Brother...?

1727
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,680
You said you know
that RJ's phone number?

1728
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:28,480
Why don't you try talking to her?

1729
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,240
- Hello...?
- Madam, this is Muthukumar

1730
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:33,240
Tell me

1731
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,000
'In a Govt sealed Theme park
on the Bangalore highway'

1732
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:38,560
You wait there

1733
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,720
- I'll come
- Make it quick, madam

1734
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,520
If you take the iPad, madam
I can go back to my hometown

1735
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:45,920
Madam...hello...?

1736
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,560
Brother...?

1737
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:58,960
Any problem?

1738
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:00,920
What happened?

1739
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,480
If you stay with me,
you'll be in danger

1740
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,000
Police will get here soon

1741
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:06,800
Please go away

1742
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,120
We have a PhD in tackling them!

1743
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:10,920
Not only with money, Vicky

1744
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,680
You can impress people
with a helping nature also

1745
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,880
I somehow want to help you but...

1746
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,880
I don't know what to do
But I'm always with you, brother

1747
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,000
Hello boss

1748
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:25,280
You don't have to worry

1749
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:26,680
We'll handle whoever comes

1750
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:27,720
I'm Vikram Vishwanath

1751
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,920
I own Vikram group
of companies, okay?

1752
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,680
Sir, is this the time
to get introduced?

1753
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:35,120
Given a chance you will
stick out your visiting card!

1754
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,520
Sir, I hear a siren

1755
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:39,040
Sir, police
Come on, rush

1756
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:40,960
Never thought
they'll come so soon

1757
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:41,960
Where's Charu?

1758
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:45,280
(Islamic prayer)

1759
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,360
Aiyaiyo! It is locked

1760
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,680
Let's climb up

1761
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,040
Climb one by one

1762
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,760
Hurry up

1763
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:10,280
- How many on the whole?
- About 6 or 7, sir

1764
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,840
- Kill all of them
- Okay, sir

1765
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,120
Shoot at sight!

1766
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:18,840
I don't want them alive, GO!

1767
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,040
What will we do sitting here?

1768
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,000
Let's see if there
is any escape route

1769
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,040
Sit tight here

1770
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,200
- Let me come, brother
- Dad, don't go

1771
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,320
Sit here

1772
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:29,600
Let us find out

1773
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:00,720
Are you okay?

1774
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:07,960
- Daddy!!
- Charu, where were you?

1775
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,080
Dad...go to your left

1776
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,400
Right...right

1777
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,320
Dad, that's aunty

1778
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:31,720
Me, sir...don't shoot me

1779
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,040
- Throw
- Catch it

1780
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:50,960
Dad

1781
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:52,800
Come this way

1782
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,280
Watch your step

1783
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,600
Climb up

1784
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,120
Dad

1785
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,520
Come

1786
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:14,680
Daddy

1787
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,680
Dad!

1788
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:21,760
Is anyone hurt?

1789
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:26,880
Give me your hand

1790
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,680
There is a hole

1791
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,520
Seems to be a way out

1792
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,440
Is there a passage?

1793
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:44,200
Go, sir

1794
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:46,120
- I'll go, you follow
- Get in, man

1795
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,320
Hurry up

1796
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,040
They will spot you
Come down fast

1797
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:00,840
You'll be in trouble
if you're with me

1798
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,280
I told you we can
face it together

1799
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,320
Don't argue
Please go

1800
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:09,600
'Hey listen
Come with us'

1801
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,640
'Are you mad?'

1802
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,920
You had better surrender

1803
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:05,640
You can't escape

1804
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,920
You've killed a journalist

1805
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,200
And a police officer

1806
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:17,280
Fire!

1807
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:00,400
This is for you

1808
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,680
Yasodara
Buddha's wife

1809
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,600
Your wallet and charger

1810
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:12,920
Mr Vikram
Son of Vishwanath

1811
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:16,280
I wanted you to forget
your pompous image

1812
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,800
And see the real world
through different eyes

1813
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:19,960
That's all

1814
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:21,320
Sorry

1815
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,200
Christina

1816
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:27,600
Thanks for everything

1817
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:29,680
I am not Christina

1818
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,240
Cheater! Where did you gallivant?

1819
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:56,520
Dileepa, I told you so, right?

1820
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:57,680
Did you believe me?

1821
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:02,160
What we love will always come back
to us, life is a full circle

1822
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,800
Bring your daughter in

1823
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:05,840
Okay

1824
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:08,160
No loss is temporary
Come inside

1825
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:12,240
Drink this

1826
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:17,640
Muthukumar would have survived?

1827
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:20,400
Let's hope he is alive
What else can we do?

1828
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:24,280
This is your share
as per our deal

1829
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,240
I don't want it
Keep it for yourself

1830
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,400
What's up with you?

1831
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:30,520
I can't reform
like the speed of lightning

1832
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:35,000
Look at my next plan

1833
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,920
Want to join?
50-50!

1834
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:43,400
Instead of blabbering
about sin and salvation...

1835
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:45,880
...take your share and
go back safe and sound

1836
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:12,880
Hey! Madhu?

1837
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,680
Where did you vanish?

1838
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:19,080
I was so worried
you had left me

1839
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,600
I searched for you everywhere

1840
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:22,400
'All the details
are in the iPad'

1841
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:26,160
'Many people will be affected
if this News leaks out'

1842
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,080
'I mean college reputation'

1843
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:29,600
'Minister's future'

1844
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:31,680
'Give me your 2nd option'

1845
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:35,960
'Based on the evidence in an iPad
submitted by Mr Dileepan from KK Nagar'

1846
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,320
'...to the Commissioner'

1847
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,920
'Police officer Nagendra Babu'

1848
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,160
'Minister Ramamurthy'

1849
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:44,240
'And Vijayalakshmi, registrar of college
have been arrested immediately'

1850
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:48,080
'In this connection, Radio Jockey
Abhinaya who has 1st hand information'

1851
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:50,480
'...is meeting the Press and Media now'

1852
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:52,560
Muthukumar was an innocent soul

1853
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:56,320
Just because he witnessed the murders
of a journalist and policeman...

1854
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:59,960
'...he has been subjected
to all these atrocities'

1855
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:04,000
The guilty even if they hold
high positions and have immense clout

1856
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:06,920
...they should be punished without fail

1857
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:08,800
Now truth has won

1858
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:18,400
Sorry

1859
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:22,720
We will use Muthukumar's body
as a trump card, call the people

1860
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:23,960
Lead an intellectual movement

1861
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,560
'A police officer on duty
has been shot dead'

1862
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:31,400
'Sudden disappearance of a journalist
investigating a case of honor killing'

1863
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:35,160
'Mr Muthukumar who drove Mr Saravanan
was murdered in a fake encounter'

1864
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:40,520
'These deaths have created a stir amongst
the public and Human Rights activists'

1865
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,800
Look here, I am letting you in
because my colleague insisted

1866
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,920
Police case
Come out soon

1867
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:53,840
Hello?

1868
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,480
'Brother, have you reached?'

1869
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,280
'Where are you now?'

1870
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,960
'Mother is asking for you repeatedly'

1871
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:06,800
'Hello! Why aren't you
saying anything?'

1872
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,400
'Anna?'

1873
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:12,320
'Are you there, brother?'

1874
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:15,960
This is your brother speaking!

1875
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:19,000
I will be there very soon

1876
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:29,200
'As long as we don't help or
harm anyone, he is a stranger to us'

1877
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:32,000
'If we do either of these 2 acts
he becomes a part of our life'
