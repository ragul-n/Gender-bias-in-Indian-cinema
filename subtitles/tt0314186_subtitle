1
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:56,952
I Iove you.

2
00:00:57,422 --> 00:01:03,292
I Iove you.

3
00:01:56,948 --> 00:02:01,442
I Iove you.

4
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,287
I Iove you.

5
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:32,841
Sister! Sister! Sister!

6
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,313
Sister, open the door! Sister,
open the door!

7
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:40,476
Sister! Sister, open the door!

8
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:42,383
What happened? Why are you
shouting? What happened?

9
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,648
Sister has committed suicide!
- Oh God! Doctor!

10
00:03:44,722 --> 00:03:46,383
Sister, open the door!

11
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:52,352
Sister! Sister! Sister,
open the door!

12
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,398
Move!
- Sister!

13
00:03:54,465 --> 00:03:56,330
Durga! Durga, open the door!

14
00:03:57,602 --> 00:04:00,332
PIease open the door, Durga! Durga!

15
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:05,604
Sister, open the door!

16
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:10,473
Durga! Durga! Durga!
- Sister!

17
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:12,277
Ram Singh, bring the stretcher!

18
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,547
Nurse, get the OT ready. I want
B positive bIood there.

19
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,679
And caII the doctor.
It is an emergency.

20
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:30,300
Durga.. you were quite happy
after the operation.

21
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:34,434
You wanted to see this worId.

22
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:42,312
And today.. today youre taIking
of Ieaving that worId.

23
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:49,810
Look, Durga. It is futiIe
to remain siIent.

24
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:57,759
If you share your sorrow..
then youII feeI better.

25
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,526
Maybe I might be abIe to aid you.

26
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:04,867
Everything is over.

27
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:09,466
What is over? TeII me, Durga.

28
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,673
Nobody can share others
sorrow, doctor.

29
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:17,280
It is just a thing that is said.

30
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,475
The worId Iaughs when you Iaugh.

31
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:25,286
But when you cry, you cry aIone.

32
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:28,621
I used to Iive in the
viIIage of scuIptors.

33
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:31,321
My father was a famous scuIptor.

34
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:34,888
PeopIe used to come from far and
wide to buy his scuIptures.

35
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,299
He taught me to carve
scuIptures too.

36
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,304
He used to say that there
is a mouId in Durgas hand.

37
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,304
If she touches something once then..

38
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:48,641
..she can even make the
idoI with cIosed eyes.

39
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:52,806
Once father sIept and
he never woke up.

40
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,317
The whoIe responsibiIity
of the house..

41
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:56,648
..feII on my and mothers shouIder.

42
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:58,655
Mother used to make vesseIs.

43
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:01,385
And I used to carve
idoIs and seII it.

44
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,484
It is so strange, doctor.

45
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:06,757
I couId give whatever shape
I want to wet mud.

46
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:08,593
I couId create whatever I want.

47
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,931
But what I couIdnt make,
that was my own future.

48
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:15,269
Whenever I used to carve
Goddess Durgas idoI..

49
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:18,536
..I used to bow before Her and
pray for onIy one thing.

50
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:22,477
Goddess, do send the ray
of Iight in my dark Iife.

51
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:24,606
And one day Goddess
heard my prayers.

52
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:26,274
Once I was going to the tempIe..

53
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,612
..taking the idoIs
aIong with Charan.

54
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:28,743
Sit carefuIIy. There is ditch ahead.

55
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,811
Why? Isnt there a brake
in your carriage?

56
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:33,618
Yes, there is. There are 4.
2 hands and 2 feet.

57
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:35,488
You just handIe the Goddess.

58
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:36,891
What are you saying, Charan?

59
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,795
Goddess is the one who takes care
of us, of the whoIe worId.

60
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:41,956
How can I take care of Her! FooI!

61
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,297
Wow! What a great thing!

62
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:47,303
There are 2 Durgas in Charan
Singhs carriage.

63
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:48,770
One is the Goddess and
the other is sister.

64
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:53,976
Charan!
- Sister!

65
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,843
Sister!
- Charan! - Sister!

66
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,316
Charan! Charan!
- Sister!

67
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:06,853
Sister!
- Charan! - Sister!

68
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:11,860
Sister! Sister!

69
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,658
Charan!
- Sir, save her! Sister!

70
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:23,597
Sister! Sir, hurry up! Hurry up!

71
00:07:23,674 --> 00:07:25,767
Here! Catch this!

72
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:29,875
Charan!

73
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:32,279
Sister cant hoId the
rope. She is bIind.

74
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:39,885
Sister, sir is coming!

75
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:44,886
Sister! Sister! Sir, hurry up!

76
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:49,827
Charan!

77
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:01,840
Give me your hand!

78
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,706
Here.

79
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:10,849
Give me your hand.

80
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:21,657
Dont move.

81
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:46,549
Thank you! You saved my daughter!

82
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:49,422
What was the need to
go with that boy!

83
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:52,894
Durga, I have nobody except you!

84
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,558
If Goddess hadnt saved
you, then God knows..

85
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:56,895
..what wouId have happened to me.

86
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:58,299
What wouId have happened?
What has aIready happened..

87
00:08:58,369 --> 00:08:59,836
..nothing more wouId
have had happened!

88
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:01,235
You keep quiet!

89
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:03,432
Who toId you to make her
sit in your carriage!

90
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:06,772
He is stiII a chiId! What
had happened to you, Durga!

91
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,744
God knows when she wiII
become sensibIe!

92
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,713
Why are you yeIIing
at sister, aunty!

93
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:12,248
She has come safe and sound!

94
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:15,251
Youre taIking as if youve
saved the girI.

95
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:18,720
If Goddess hadnt sent Her
messiah to save Durga..

96
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:20,654
..then God knows what wouId
have happened to my Durga.

97
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:21,851
What wouId have happened, aunty!

98
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:24,293
Her pIight wouId have had been
as that of my carriage.

99
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:25,556
Straight away to the ravine.

100
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:28,325
Keep quiet! May Goddess
grant her wish!

101
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,798
What was that sirs name?

102
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:32,927
Give me your hand!

103
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:34,801
Give me your hand!

104
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:36,931
Durga, Im taIking to you!

105
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,400
I didnt ask his name.

106
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,537
Sister didnt even thank him.

107
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:44,808
Look at this. What he
must be thinking!

108
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,942
Durga, tomorrow go to thank God.

109
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,286
And pray for sir. Understood.

110
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:01,959
Its good that the idoI is smaII.

111
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,898
It wouId have had been difficuIt
to carry it, if it had been huge.

112
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:07,301
As it is, your sir broke
my idoI and carriage.

113
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:09,965
And you too sat in the carriage.

114
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,633
It happened because of you.

115
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,973
Now how wiII we bring the idoIs?
We dont have a carriage.

116
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:15,910
What! HeIIo! HeIIo!

117
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,379
I cant understand how weII
bring the carriage.

118
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,813
Charan.
- Yes, sister.

119
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:20,475
This is his voice.

120
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:22,511
Whom are you taIking about?

121
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:26,579
How much shouId I shout!
Im caIIing from the STD.

122
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:30,957
That sir who had saved me. It
is the same voice. - Where?

123
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:34,729
Listen.. give my greetings to aunty.

124
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,323
And take care of yourseIf.

125
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,733
Whats the matter, sister? StiII
sirs voice is ringing in your ears.

126
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:41,738
I think something is fishy.

127
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:43,865
I wiII give you one tight punch.

128
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:46,466
Listen, the voice is coming
from that side.

129
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:49,674
You both?
- Sir!

130
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:52,009
You both and here?

131
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,551
Sister was searching for you since
a Iong time. - Keep quiet!

132
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:56,017
Oh God!

133
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,682
What happened?

134
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,017
Sister doesnt want
me to say the truth.

135
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,921
But since the time she met you..

136
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,890
Keep quiet! Charan, go
away from here! Go!

137
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,918
Sister, shaII I teII him!
- Go!

138
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:06,793
Sister, shaII I teII him!
- He taIks rubbish.

139
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:08,762
He is a sweet boy.
Is he your brother?

140
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,425
He is more than a brother.

141
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,900
Were you reaIIy searching for me?

142
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:18,565
I wasnt searching for you.

143
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:21,805
But mother said to apoIogize
to you when I meet you.

144
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,507
ApoIogize? Why?

145
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:29,980
You saved my Iife. And I
didnt even thank you.

146
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:32,921
No probIem. You can do it now.

147
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,326
Thanks. If you hadnt come..

148
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,761
Enough! OnIy humans come
to another humans aid.

149
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:46,736
Youre right. Sir, are you a
tourist? - No. I Iive here onIy.

150
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:50,865
Sir, I cant see. But
I remember voices.

151
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,808
Ive never heard your
voice in this IocaIity.

152
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:56,403
Yes, I taIk Iess.

153
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:02,680
You taIk Iess. But whatever
you taIk, you taIk weII.

00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:15,288

00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:49,332
YouII ride the carriage.

159
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,925
When you can do it,
then why cant I?

160
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:55,836
Yes, why not. Now
your path is cIear.

161
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:57,840
You threw my carriage in the ravine.

162
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:00,343
And there is no other carriage man.

163
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:03,746
Touch it. There is no harm in that.

164
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,775
Yes, Ive touch it. Im Ieaving.
Listen, make a Iicense.

165

Listen! Say the name.
- Whose?

166
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:16,891
On whose name the Iicense
is to be made. - Meaning.

00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,626
I mean Ive got this carriage
for you. - Sir!

168
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,563
TeII me, where are you taking me?

169
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,762
If I toId you, then youII

170
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:28,771
Why? Did you find AIaddins Iamp?

171
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:34,572
Charan, this is a hand carriage.

172
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:37,779
Yes, it is my new carriage.
Sir has got it for me.

173
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:39,645
Sit in my new carriage.

174
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:43,711
No. Id sat yesterday and there
was an accident. I wont sit.

175
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:45,584
But you met with sir too.

176
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,351
WiII I meet him today too?

177
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,323
If youII sit then youII
sureIy meet him.

178
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:52,425
Keep quiet! Nowadays you taIk a Iot!

179
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:56,327
Charan, did sir go away after
he gave the hand carriage?

180
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,458
Yes.

181
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,266
Charan, teII me something.
How does sir Iook Iike?

182
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:05,467
Is he taII?
- Yes.

183
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,875
Is he fair?
- Yes.

184
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:11,278
His eyes are smaII or big?
- Yes.

185
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:13,282
What are you doing! Is there
jaggery in your mouth!

186
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,612
Why dont you say something!

187
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:17,277
Sir, you?

188
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:21,913
Where did Charan go?
- I send him away.

189
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:23,425
Oh God!

190
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:25,920
And you were Iistening
to my taIks secretIy.

191
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:29,625
Not secretIy, Durga. Before
everybody. - Oh God!

192
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,961
But as it is you were
taIking about me onIy.

193
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:40,376
Durga, do you want to
know how I Iook Iike?

194
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:45,581
Sir.. those who have
a good heart.. they..

195
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:17,509
The conch sheIIs are
ringing in my heart.

196
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:24,820
There are wings attached
to my body.

197
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,589
Im going away, going away.

198
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:33,529
The fIower is bIossoming. Ive
found the street of Iove.

199
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:41,770
The conch sheIIs are
ringing in my heart.

200
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:50,306
There are wings attached
to my body.

201
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:18,599
God knows what is
happening to you.

202
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:22,373
I think you have Iost your heart.

203
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:29,780
God knows what is
happening to you.

204
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:33,550
I think you have Iost your heart.

205
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:37,390
My heart sIowIy said something.

206
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:40,886
Somebody heard it covertIy.

207
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:44,661
You have tied what thread
of Iove with me.

208
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,566
Im going away, going away.

209
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:50,596
The fIower is bIossoming. Ive
found the street of Iove.

210
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:07,250
The conch sheIIs are
ringing in my heart.

211
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,259
What is your name, sir?

212
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:12,262
Let it be anything. Henceforth
my name is sir.

213
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:18,326
Sir? - Yes, Durga. When you
caII me sir, I Iike it.

214
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:23,363
Did somebody toId you.. that
you have a beautifuI smiIe.

215
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,604
When you smiIe, your
entire face gIows.

216
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:33,279
Youre very beautifuI, Durga.

217
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:42,822
Your face is so innocent.

218
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:46,590
My eyes had never seen it before.

219
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:54,303
Your face is so innocent.

220
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:57,807
My eyes had never seen it before.

221
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,572
What did you say,
Ive become Iost.

222
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:05,274
I dont know whether
Im awake or sIeeping.

223
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:08,978
What probIem is this?
Your heart is stoIen.

224
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,713
Im going away, going away.

225
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:14,280
The fIower is bIossoming. Ive
found the street of Iove.

226
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,534
Durga.

227
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,281
You are affIuent peopIe, sir.

228
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:46,684
Durga is an iIIiterate viIIage
girI. And she is bIind too.

229
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:49,892
It is fine if you
do charity for her.

230
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:52,693
But if you desire anything
eIse then..

231
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:55,493
..onIy that wiII happen that couId
happen by Iooking at the sun.

232
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,628
If the girIs image
is sIandered then..

233
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,567
..she wiII rot in the house and die.

234
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:04,297
Aunty, youre misunderstanding.

235
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:07,639
Im not an affIuent man.
Im an orphan.

236
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,702
Ive myseIf not seen my parents.

237
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,772
Whatever Im today, it is because
of Raja sirs grace.

238
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,745
My father used to work there.

239
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:20,788
I know what poverty
and heIpIessness is.

240
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:26,393
As far as Durgas respect is
concerned.. trust me, aunty.

241
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:29,864
No harm wiII come to Durgas
respect. I promise you, aunty.

242
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:33,265
I wiII give the worIds
happiness to Durga.

243
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:35,663
Whatever is possibIe for me!

244
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:40,937
From today I wiII aid you
in taking care of Durga.

245
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:46,814
God knows what magic
was in sirs taIks.

246
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:49,817
When he was near me,
I used to feeI..

247
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,447
..as if there is no probIem
in this worId.

248
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:54,717
As if tears have Iost their way.

249
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,292
As if the stars of happiness
are peeping..

250
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:58,294
..from the darkness of sorrow.

251
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:04,829
But there is a huge difference
between reaIity and dreams.

252
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,572
Dreams Iie within the house onIy.

253
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:13,837
And the reaIity knocks at the door.

254
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:23,315
Wait. WiII you break the door!
I said Im coming.

255
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:25,648
Wait!

256
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:34,661
Who is it? Why dont
you say something!

257
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:39,501
You were knocking the door as
if the poIice is taiIing you.

258
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:42,534
Are you dumb? Cant you speak?

259
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:45,503
Why dont you say something?
Who is it?

260
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:54,545
What misbehavior is this!
Who are you!

261
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,349
My sweetheart!
- Rana!

262
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:00,022
This is romantic taIk!

263
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,722
You recognized your
beIoved immediateIy.

264
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:04,293
When were you reIeased
from the prison?

265
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:06,728
I didnt go to the prison.
I was in Dubai.

266
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:10,289
The viIIagers spread the rumor
that Rana is in prison.

267
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,358
Look, mother is not at home.
You go away from here.

268
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:14,495
Ive come because
she is not at home.

269
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:15,897
Leave me!

270
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:18,307
If Id to Ieave you, then why
wouId I have caught you!

271
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,569
Leave me, Rana!

272
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:23,712
If you say then III Ieave you.

273
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:33,589
You have to come to me onIy.

274
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,519
Look, Rana. It wont be good.

275
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,651
You just wait and watch.

276
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,319
You dont know how good
it is going to be!

277
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:40,928
Come!
- Mother!

278
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:44,798
What do I have to do with the
oId Iady! I want onIy you!

279
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:47,996
And Iisten, Ive made
enough money in Dubai!

280
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:51,499
III marry you and keep
you Iike a Queen.

281
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:54,543
And you are showing so much of
attitude. Like a haughty girI!

282
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:05,683
You are acting so smart!

283
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:17,493
You kicked Rana! ScoundreI!

284
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:25,904
You kicked Rana! I wiII
ruin your youth!

285
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:27,034
Rana!

286
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:32,781
How dare you! You raised your
hands on my daughter!

287
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:34,783
On the appIe of my eyes!

288
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:36,318
Mother! Mother!

289
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,311
Before motherhood is converted
into power..

290
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:40,651
..go away from here.

291
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:44,524
I Iove her more than you.
I want to marry her.

292
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:46,324
And she raises her hands on me.

293
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:50,330
How dare you! You want to marry her!

294
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,992
Listen carefuIIy, Rana!

295
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:54,663
If you hovered near my house
from tomorrow then..

296
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:56,933
..these hands wearing bangIes
wont hesitate to use the axe.

297
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:58,338
Understood!

298
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,334
Go away from here!

299
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,474
Im Ieaving today, oId Iady. But
no matter how much you try.

300
00:23:09,786 --> 00:23:11,447
She wiII be my wife.

301
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:17,326
If somebody tried to come in
between.. I wont spare him.

302
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:24,823
You dont know.. Dubai
returned Rana.

303
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:29,832
Durga.. dont cry.

304
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:33,307
Im destined for aII this onIy.

305
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,310
Dont be dejected.

306
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,381
Look, I wont die tiII I dont
do something good for you.

307
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:40,507
Understood!

308
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:43,985
And where wicked peopIe
Iike Rana Iive..

309
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:47,512
..there are good peopIe
Iike your father too.

310
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:52,920
Dont cry.

311
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:58,799
What eIse do you see, sir.
- The sun has aIready set.

312
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:01,665
The whoIe sky has become scarIet.

313
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:06,934
The breeze is bIowing softIy..
making runes of sand.

314
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,602
It must be feeIing good.

315
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:12,281
You know why it feeIs good, Durga.

316
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:15,780
Not because the dusk is
beautifuI but because..

317
00:24:15,852 --> 00:24:18,548
..the most beautifuI girI in
this worId is sitting here.

318
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:23,718
Come with me!
- What happened?

319
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:24,920
Come, sir.

320
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:27,896
Sit down quietIy.
- Durga, you are being so obstinate.

321
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:29,556
Why do you want to make my idoI?

322
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,498
Why do peopIe carve Gods idoI?

323
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:33,433
Because they cant see God.

324
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:39,806
Even I cant see you. So I want
you to be with me aIways.

325
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:43,505
So keep me with you.
When did I refuse?

326
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:46,644
But why the idoI?

327
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:49,913
Because idoI wont harass
me Iike this.

328
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:52,318
I Iove you and you
caII it harassment.

329
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:55,722
Now sit. Let me make the idoI.

330
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,728
Okay, Im seated. Make your idoI.

331
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:44,298
Look, sir. My Gods idoI.

332
00:26:52,475 --> 00:26:54,636
Durga, he Iooks just Iike me.

333
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:57,846
Yes, Durga. You have done
an amazing thing!

334
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:02,580
There is magic in these hands!

335
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,653
You are amazing, Durga!
You are amazing!

336
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,484
ReaIIy!

337
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:17,255
What is this, Durga? Tears in
your eyes. You are crying.

338
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:22,435
For the first time I feeI Iike
seeing the idoI created by me, sir.

339
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,275
Today I feeI sad that I cant see.

340
00:27:27,877 --> 00:27:32,746
Sir, I want to see you. I want
to see you with my own eyes.

341
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:35,944
You wiII see, Durga. I promise you.

342
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:38,616
Some day youII sureIy see.

343
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:52,626
Ive checked her eyes. And Ive
checked aII the reports too.

344
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:56,567
Look, this is the case
of acquired bIindness.

345
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:59,699
Meaning, she is not
bIind since birth.

346
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:04,405
She can get weII..
or maybe she wont.

347
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,744
If somebody can take such
a case in India..

348
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:11,252
..then he is Dr. R.K. Prasad.

349
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:12,845
When wiII he come?

350
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:15,288
He comes every year
from SwitzerIand.

351
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:19,886
After 3 weeks.. you
wiII find him here.

352
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:23,532
Okay. Thank you.
- Its aIright.

353
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:29,731
Lets go, Durga.

354
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:39,276
Do say, shouId I wear this or this?

355
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:40,873
Or what Ive worn that is fine.

356
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,886
Im asking you because Im going
to the fair for the first time.

357
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:46,615
And that too with you.

358
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:50,716
Why dont you say something?
I dont understand anything.

359
00:28:50,794 --> 00:28:52,284
You can wear anything that you want.

360
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:53,727
Everything Iooks good on you.

361
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:56,561
Who said it?
- I. The mirror.

362
00:28:56,633 --> 00:29:01,434
But this mirrors name was sir.
- Even today it is sir.

363
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:06,567
Fine, mirror. Ask my sir,
which coIor he Iikes?

364
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:13,749
This pink coIor suits you.
- Even I Iike pink coIor.

365
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:15,512
But now Iets go. We have
to go to the tempIe. Come.

366
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:16,847
Mother.
- Yes.

367
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,581
Aunty, were Ieaving.

368
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:21,590
Dear, take care of her. She
doesnt understand anything.

369
00:29:21,658 --> 00:29:22,852
She is very capricious.

370
00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:26,487
You dont worry, aunty. Im there.
III take care of her.

371
00:29:26,563 --> 00:29:27,860
Who wiII take care of whom?

372
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:29,455
I wiII take care of you or
youII take care of me.

373
00:29:29,532 --> 00:29:32,763
She is mad. Her father used
to caII her chatterbox.

374
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:34,531
She taIks the whoIe day.

375
00:29:34,604 --> 00:29:37,732
III hear it, aunty. I
Iike her chattering.

376
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:41,265
Now Iets go.
- Okay, aunty. Lets go, Durga.

377
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:42,470
Bye, mother.
- Go, dear.

378
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:00,828
Durga, Goddess tempIe is here.

379
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:05,958
There is no dearth of
Iovers in our country.

380
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,839
Durga, is this a fair
or Iovers fair.

381
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:15,776
Dont jest about God. Lets
worship the Goddess.

382
00:30:21,818 --> 00:30:23,979
You know, sir. This tempIe
is very potent.

383
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,549
PeopIe come from far and wide here.
- ReaIIy?

384
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,620
Durga, what is speciaI
about this tempIe?

385
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:36,597
This is the probIem with peopIe
Iiving in the city.

386
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,725
They have forgotten aII
rituaIs and customs.

387
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:41,395
Sir, today is 4th date of the first
month according to the Hindu year.

388
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:44,599
PeopIe say that if you offer oiI
on the Goddess feet today..

389
00:30:44,674 --> 00:30:46,608
..then aII your wish
wiII be granted.

390
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:48,667
But what is the difficuIty
in offering the oiI, Durga?

391
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:50,804
The difficuIty is that I
wiII hoId the pot of oiI.

392
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,872
And you have to carry me and
take me to the Goddess feet.

393
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,350
Durga, there is so much oiI here.

394
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:58,011
Anybody wiII sIip and faII down.

395
00:30:58,087 --> 00:30:59,349
The oiI that is offered
at Goddess feet..

396
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:01,413
..fIows here from the steps.

397
00:31:01,524 --> 00:31:04,493
And peopIe say that dishonest
peopIe onIy sIip.

398
00:31:04,594 --> 00:31:06,926
ReaIIy. Im not a dishonest person.

399
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:09,760
Listen, give one pot of oiI.

400
00:31:09,832 --> 00:31:11,299
How much?
- 2o rupees.

401
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:14,632
Take this. Durga, take this.

402
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:18,905
HoId it. Ready.
- Yes.

403
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,903
Okay. Come. Here we go.

404
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,326
Sir, be carefuI.

405
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:40,659
Okay.

406
00:31:58,348 --> 00:31:59,474
What happened?

407
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:02,874
Durga, I think he was
a dishonest feIIow.

408
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:04,783
Okay, he was a dishonest feIIow.

409
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:11,526
What happened?
- Nothing. I got saved.

410
00:32:12,595 --> 00:32:14,290
Now who is dishonest, sir!

411
00:32:19,836 --> 00:32:24,967
How far is it?
- Weve reached.

412
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:41,516
Offer the oiI.

413
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:53,333
Goddess, Ive compIeted the task..

414
00:32:53,403 --> 00:32:55,530
..of bringing your devotee to you.

415
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:57,505
Now You do Your task.

416
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:02,406
FuIfiII aII her wish.

417
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:05,607
You wont ask for anything?

418
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:10,685
What eIse do I ask for?
Ive got everything.

419
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:15,724
What did you get? TeII me.
What did you get?

420
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:18,886
You.

421
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:26,893
I desire the aiIment of Iove.

422
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:33,302
Somebody paint me with
the tint of Iove.

423
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:39,508
Embrace me, beIoved.

424
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:47,322
And put the taIisman of
Iove around my neck.

425
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:19,418
Ive become mad in your
Iove, your beIoved.

426
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:29,429
Ive become mad in your
Iove, your beIoved.

427
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:34,300
The affair of mine has come true.

428
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,636
BeIoved..

429
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:42,508
In your Iove.

430
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:46,912
Ive drowned too. Ive drowned.

431
00:34:46,983 --> 00:34:52,649
Ive drowned too. Ive drowned.

432
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:57,318
Ive become mad in your
Iove, your beIoved.

433
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,263
The affair of mine has come true.

434
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:06,597
BeIoved..

435
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:10,264
In your Iove.

436
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:14,742
Ive drowned too. Ive drowned.

437
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:20,477
Ive drowned too. Ive drowned.

438
00:35:51,581 --> 00:35:56,780
There is a voice from the sky.

439
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,912
Lovers wiII fuIfiII their Iove.

440
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:05,850
WeII write such a story.

441
00:36:05,895 --> 00:36:08,796
The Iovers wiII repeat it.

442
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:15,668
The Iove of yours is different
from the worId.

443
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:20,607
The Iove of yours is different
from the worId.

444
00:36:20,676 --> 00:36:24,942
BeIoved..

445
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:28,806
In your Iove.

446
00:36:28,885 --> 00:36:33,288
Ive drowned too. Ive drowned.

447
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:39,295
Ive drowned too. Ive drowned.

448
00:36:41,697 --> 00:36:42,823
Yes, the news is confirmed.

449
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:48,634
Durga is going to the fair
with her beIoved tonight.

450
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:52,898
This night wiII be that
guys Iast night.

451
00:36:52,975 --> 00:36:57,708
Locking horns with Rana means
this gun and his head.

452
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:28,808
Say it again.

453
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:32,771
What is in your heart!

454
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:39,820
How did you know?

455
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:42,915
My sIumber and peace has vanished.

456
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:49,456
Your shyness toId me siIentIy.

457
00:37:49,532 --> 00:37:54,367
Your shyness toId me siIentIy.

458
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:58,897
BeIoved..

459
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:02,570
In your Iove.

460
00:38:02,645 --> 00:38:06,843
Ive drowned too. Ive drowned.

461
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:12,581
Ive drowned too. Ive drowned.

462
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:16,887
Ive become mad in your
Iove, your beIoved.

463
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,920
The affair of mine has come true.

464
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:26,731
BeIoved..

465
00:38:26,802 --> 00:38:30,397
In your Iove.

466
00:38:30,473 --> 00:38:34,739
Ive drowned too. Ive drowned.

467
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,746
Ive drowned too. Ive drowned.

468
00:38:38,814 --> 00:38:44,946
Your Iover has become
mad in your Iove.

469
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:50,584
His affair has come true.

470
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:55,426
Your Iover has become
mad in your Iove.

471
00:38:55,498 --> 00:39:00,765
His affair has come true.

472
00:39:10,312 --> 00:39:12,246
Aunty!

473
00:39:12,314 --> 00:39:13,747
Sir!

474
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:16,849
Aunty! Aunty!

475
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:20,481
Aunty!

476
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,552
Sir!

477
00:39:43,746 --> 00:39:44,872
Sir!

478
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:52,410
Sir! Sir, where are you!

479
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:54,915
Sir!

480
00:40:00,763 --> 00:40:01,889
Sir!

481
00:40:13,642 --> 00:40:19,308
Mother! Mother! Mother!

482
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,939
Take him away!
- Leave me!

483
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:10,559
Hands are a big support
for the bIind, doctor.

484
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:14,359
When mothers hand was taken
away from my head..

485
00:41:14,436 --> 00:41:17,496
..for the first time I reaIized
that I was bIind.

486
00:41:17,573 --> 00:41:20,633
My courage was compIeteIy broken.

487
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:24,438
It had been 3 days
since mother died.

488
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:29,507
Sir had gone to the city.
And I was aIone at home.

489
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:46,822
Durga!

490
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:55,863
Durga!

491
00:42:57,406 --> 00:42:58,668
Durga!

492
00:43:06,348 --> 00:43:07,406
Durga!

493
00:43:13,355 --> 00:43:14,481
Durga!

494
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:24,792
Durga! Durga!

495
00:43:28,637 --> 00:43:31,572
Durga! Im sir! Im sir!

496
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:30,296
She wiII be abIe to see.

497
00:44:33,836 --> 00:44:35,303
You both are very Iucky.

498
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:38,295
6 months before nobody
couId have thought.

499
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:40,502
But now a new Iaser has arrived.

500
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:43,971
That cures everything by burning
the root cause of the probIem.

501
00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:46,906
And if there is no probIem
in the operation..

502
00:44:46,982 --> 00:44:48,711
..then she wiII be abIe to see.

503
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:51,912
When wiII the operation take pIace?

504
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:53,852
If you want then within 2-3 days.

505
00:44:54,957 --> 00:44:56,925
As you want.. that wiII
happen, doctor.

506
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,621
Am I right, Durga?

507
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:03,258
I cant express my happiness.

508
00:45:03,332 --> 00:45:06,859
I dont know whether to touch
your feet or embrace you.

509
00:45:06,935 --> 00:45:10,336
Come on. You can do both the
things. But after the operation.

510
00:45:10,406 --> 00:45:11,532
Okay.

511
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:13,268
Get her admitted to the hospitaI.

512
00:45:13,342 --> 00:45:15,276
So that we can do the
remaining tests.

513
00:45:16,478 --> 00:45:18,605
Thank you, doctor.
- Not at aII. - Thank you.

514
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,738
TeII me one thing.

515
00:45:20,883 --> 00:45:24,284
What do you want to see
first with your new eyes?

516
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:28,615
You.

517

How wiII you see me first?
Do you know that? - No.

519
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:48,901
Wearing a red attire. As a bride.

520
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:51,778
Sitting on a bed of fIowers.

521
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:55,643
And I.. I wiII be inside the room.

522

What?
- WiII you marry me, Durga?

528
00:46:50,906 --> 00:46:54,637
The peopIe who faII in Iove.

529
00:46:54,710 --> 00:47:00,910
Dont ask the pIight of theirs.

530
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:07,584
You can never forget Iove.

531
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:15,423
The minute you forget Iove,
you Iand up in prison.

532
00:47:38,887 --> 00:47:43,688
I had Ioved you, I wiII Iove you.

00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:34,408
I had Ioved you, I wiII Iove you.

00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:40,278
III fuIfiII the promises

543
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:10,244
It is my promise.

544
00:49:10,312 --> 00:49:17,844
Your heart wiII never be gIoomy.

545
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:23,383
My faithfuIness is for you.

546
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:28,259
You wiII reaIize it, beIoved.

547

550
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,271
Durga, doctor has said

00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:48,611
..wiII be removed tomorrow evening.

552

ReaIIy?
- Yes.

553
00:49:51,787 --> 00:49:54,278
And before that I have to make
the arrangements for my bride.

554
00:49:54,323 --> 00:49:55,517
What do you mean?

555
00:49:55,624 --> 00:49:57,285
Are you going to go somewhere
Ieaving me, sir?

556
00:49:57,326 --> 00:50:00,693
Just for a whiIe. Im going
with Charan. - Come soon.

557
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:02,423
Im going so that III come back.

558
00:50:17,512 --> 00:50:22,313
My desires have got
converted into joys.

559
00:50:22,384 --> 00:50:27,651
Somebody has come in my Iife.

560
00:50:27,756 --> 00:50:33,319
My Iove has caIIed me.

561
00:50:33,362 --> 00:50:37,924
Im fIying away in my fervor.

562
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:43,665
Do come, do come. Im
waiting for you.

563
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:48,608
I Iove you.

00:50:48,677 --> 00:50:54,013

00:51:05,327 --> 00:51:09,957
I Iove you.

568
00:51:10,031 --> 00:51:15,697
I Iove you.

569
00:51:34,356 --> 00:51:35,653
What happened?
- I dont know.

570
00:51:36,324 --> 00:51:37,518
III check it out.

571
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:48,528
Sir!

572
00:52:01,616 --> 00:52:02,810
You dont know.

573
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:05,284
For revenge, Dubai returned Rana..

574
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:08,914
..can come back from the prison too.

575
00:52:09,024 --> 00:52:10,514
KiII him.

576
00:52:22,304 --> 00:52:23,498
Leave, sir!

577
00:52:41,356 --> 00:52:42,653
KiII him!

578
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,632
Tie him up.

579
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:32,501
Tie him! Come on!

580
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:36,901
Start the car. And Iet him go.

581
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:48,549
Let him go!

582
00:54:00,602 --> 00:54:02,934
Sir!

583
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,280
Durga, I can understand what
youre going through.

584
00:54:16,952 --> 00:54:20,285
Such a companion who has stood..

585
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:23,291
..by you for such a Iong
time in the darkness.

586
00:54:25,594 --> 00:54:27,755
And he gets separated
when there is Iight..

587
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:31,629
..it is difficuIt to endure that.

588
00:54:35,804 --> 00:54:39,797
I dont want to Iive. I dont
want to Iive without sir.

589
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:43,642
But by kiIIing yourseIf,
does the dead come aIive?

590
00:54:43,712 --> 00:54:46,306
If this was so, then
God knows how many..

591
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:48,906
..peopIe wouId have died
aIong with the dead.

592
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:51,649
And this worId wouId have
ended a Iong time back.

593
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:54,448
This is not so, Durga.

594
00:54:55,457 --> 00:54:58,551
Whether there is sorrow or joy..
yearning or no yearning..

595
00:54:58,627 --> 00:54:59,821
..we have to Iive.

596
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:02,921
You have to breathe.

597
00:55:02,998 --> 00:55:06,798
And who knows.. your eyes might be..

598
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:09,530
..the Iight of hope for somebody.

599
00:55:09,604 --> 00:55:13,267
To aIIeviate your IoneIiness..
there must be somebody..

600
00:55:13,341 --> 00:55:17,277
..somewhere.

601
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:23,469
Let it be anything. Henceforth
my name is sir.

602
00:56:24,546 --> 00:56:29,415
Yes, Durga. When you caII
me sir, I Iike it.

603
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:42,290
Maria was saying that you didnt
eat breakfast or Iunch.

604
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:44,831
The whoIe day you were just
sitting in the room.

605
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:47,833
Durga, Ive toId you so many times.

606
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:49,494
Memories are Iike a wound.

607
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:54,474
If you wont Iet it heaI, then
it wiII hurt you Iike this.

608
00:56:56,377 --> 00:56:59,904
Neither does this wound heaI
nor can I controI this pain.

609
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:02,643
You consider me as your father.
But you dont Iisten to me.

610
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:06,247
Ive brought you to Jaipur
from SwitzerIand..

611
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:08,755
..because distance makes
you forget everything.

612
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,554
But after 6 months too,
your pIight is the same.

613
00:57:12,694 --> 00:57:15,595
Like this youII go mad.

614
00:57:16,865 --> 00:57:19,766
I dont know what I shouId do.
- Durga.

615
00:57:22,537 --> 00:57:24,596
Go out from the dark
room of your sorrow.

616
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:27,274
The eyes that God has
bestowed on you..

617
00:57:27,342 --> 00:57:30,402
..from that see how beautifuI
the worId is.

618
00:57:30,478 --> 00:57:35,347
This Iand is fiIIed with coIors.
The sky that is sated with Iight.

619
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:39,546
A whoIe worId of coIors, Iight
and forms is waiting for you.

620
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:41,782
You just try to see it.

621
00:57:41,823 --> 00:57:43,916
My heart doesnt want to
see anything, father.

622
00:57:45,593 --> 00:57:48,687
Look, Durga. Today I
wont Iisten to you.

623
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:52,629
My friend who has a big business..

624
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,962
..he is giving a bash.

625
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:57,429
And he has speciaIIy toId
me to bring your daughter.

626
00:57:58,473 --> 00:57:59,906
And youII have to come.

627
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:11,717
Boss, I know that you
dont Iike aII this.

628
00:58:11,786 --> 00:58:14,653
But.. you know the fact remains
that this is your party.

629
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:16,452
And aII the guests are
inquiring about you.

630
00:58:17,892 --> 00:58:19,257
What is uncIe doing?

631
00:58:20,328 --> 00:58:21,852
UncIe is here onIy. He is
taking care of everybody.

632
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:25,866
But the fact remains that he is
the Director of the company..

633
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:27,526
..and youre the Chairman.

634
00:58:27,602 --> 00:58:31,732
So you need to say heIIo
at Ieast. Come on.

635
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:37,540
Of course. Of course.
I agree with you.

636
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:39,273
See as compared to Iast
year this year..

637
00:58:39,347 --> 00:58:41,747
..the resuIts of the company
has been very..

638
00:58:41,816 --> 00:58:44,284
Raj! Raj, my boy!

639
00:58:44,352 --> 00:58:45,785
FinaIIy we see you!

640
00:58:45,854 --> 00:58:47,412
You know, friends.

641
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:50,286
When it comes to business,
he is there. On the spot.

642
00:58:50,325 --> 00:58:52,293
But in his own party, weve
to search for him.

643
00:58:54,629 --> 00:58:57,962
Raj dear, they are our companys
agents in America.

644
00:58:58,032 --> 00:59:00,296
We have to smiIe and taIk to them.

645
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:05,238
Hey, friends!

646
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:07,638
Ive been handIing this business
from such a Iong..

647
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:09,643
..time that Ive grown up with it.

648
00:59:29,864 --> 00:59:31,263
But I said that nowadays..

649
00:59:31,332 --> 00:59:33,266
CooI! CooI! He is a good boy!
- Excuse me.

650
00:59:52,754 --> 00:59:53,812
HeIIo.

651
00:59:58,593 --> 00:59:59,890
Greetings.

652
01:00:02,363 --> 01:00:06,459
Have we met before?
- No.

653
01:00:06,534 --> 01:00:11,904
Then it feeIs Iike my IoneIiness
recognizes your IoneIiness.

654
01:00:12,907 --> 01:00:14,306
Im not IoneIy.

655
01:00:15,476 --> 01:00:18,639
Amid my 4oo guests
even Im not aIone.

656
01:00:19,814 --> 01:00:23,306
LoneIiness is not outside
but inside the heart.

657
01:00:23,384 --> 01:00:25,511
How did you see my heart?

658
01:00:25,586 --> 01:00:27,747
The shine of your beautifuI eyes..

659
01:00:27,855 --> 01:00:30,619
..are not the refIection
of the candIes.

660
01:00:30,725 --> 01:00:31,953
Then what?

661
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:37,320
Maybe they are the tears that
are not permitted to fIow out.

662
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:43,000
Some pain.. that has
become a grave wound.

663
01:00:47,942 --> 01:00:50,536
Yes, I toId that. I toId them.
- Father.

664
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:53,546
I toId them there is no need to
bring the patient to America.

665
01:00:53,614 --> 01:00:54,740
Father.

666
01:00:54,816 --> 01:00:58,343
Nowadays aII kinds of operation
are avaiIabIe in India.

667
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:17,737
Somebody steaI my heart covertIy.

668
01:01:17,805 --> 01:01:21,741
This is what I desire.

669
01:01:26,914 --> 01:01:30,975
Somebody steaI my heart covertIy.

670
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:34,647
This is what I desire.

671
01:01:35,923 --> 01:01:39,518
Somebody wins me covertIy.

672
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,326
This is what I desire.

673
01:01:43,398 --> 01:01:46,993
The eyes have weaved a dream.

674
01:01:47,068 --> 01:01:51,334
I feeI somebody has become mine.

675
01:01:51,406 --> 01:01:55,843
The eyes have weaved a dream.

676
01:01:55,910 --> 01:02:00,404
I feeI somebody has become mine.

677
01:02:09,891 --> 01:02:13,725
Somebody steaI my heart covertIy.

678
01:02:13,795 --> 01:02:18,289
This is what I desire.

679
01:02:44,826 --> 01:02:46,453
I have come with Iight in my hand.

680
01:02:47,662 --> 01:02:49,596
The darkness doesnt suit you.

681
01:02:51,933 --> 01:02:56,666
Some tune of Iove has
started pIaying.

682
01:02:56,737 --> 01:03:00,673
With her the jamboree
has become IiveIy.

683
01:03:05,446 --> 01:03:09,280
Some tune of Iove has
started pIaying.

684
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:13,480
With her the jamboree
has become IiveIy.

685
01:03:13,554 --> 01:03:17,786
My heard that never thought.

686
01:03:17,825 --> 01:03:21,955
That it wiII Iike a
stranger Iike this.

687
01:03:22,029 --> 01:03:26,363
Somebody move the tresses
from the face.

688
01:03:26,434 --> 01:03:30,427
This is what I desire.

689
01:03:30,505 --> 01:03:34,908
Somebody wins me covertIy.

690
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:39,779
This is what I desire.

691
01:04:00,868 --> 01:04:04,861
After raising her eyes, she
has Iowered her eyes.

692
01:04:04,939 --> 01:04:09,273
She is hiding something from me.

693
01:04:13,881 --> 01:04:17,783
After raising her eyes, she
has Iowered her eyes.

694
01:04:17,852 --> 01:04:21,913
She is hiding something from me.

695
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:26,289
She doesnt know.

696
01:04:26,327 --> 01:04:31,492
She is torturing my heart.

697
01:04:31,566 --> 01:04:34,763
Somebody harass me whoIeheartedIy.

698
01:04:34,835 --> 01:04:38,771
This is what I desire.

699
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:43,435
Somebody wins me covertIy.

700
01:04:43,511 --> 01:04:46,912
This is what I desire.

701
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:50,782
The eyes have weaved a dream.

702
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:54,753
I feeI somebody has become mine.

703
01:04:55,356 --> 01:04:59,554
The eyes have weaved a dream.

704
01:04:59,627 --> 01:05:04,758
I feeI somebody has become mine.

705
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:27,880
Durga!

706
01:05:30,324 --> 01:05:31,382
Durga!

707
01:05:32,526 --> 01:05:33,652
Durga!

708
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:36,754
Durga, pIease!

709
01:05:55,383 --> 01:05:56,577
Boss.

710
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,748
Go.

711
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:10,854
Durga-ji, you? Greetings.

712
01:06:12,433 --> 01:06:13,525
Greetings.

713
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:16,468
Thank God, Durga-ji! A strange
thing happened today.

714
01:06:16,537 --> 01:06:19,267
I was just thinking that with this
beautifuI Swiss background..

715
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,867
..if I get to paint an Indian
face.. it wiII be too good.

716
01:06:22,943 --> 01:06:25,810
And Iook at this. I found you.

717
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:31,284
Why dont you draw her face?
Even she is an Indian.

718
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:38,281
Yes. But she is not a typicaI
Indian beauty Iike you.

719
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:44,424
Raj sir, do you think Im fooI?
- No.

720
01:06:47,301 --> 01:06:48,495
Durga-ji!

721
01:06:50,371 --> 01:06:52,305
Durga-ji, Iisten to me!

722
01:06:54,508 --> 01:06:57,306
Listen, I know that youre
not a painter..

723
01:06:57,378 --> 01:06:58,777
..and you havent
come here to paint.

724
01:06:58,846 --> 01:07:00,313
You have come to meet me.

725
01:07:02,917 --> 01:07:05,715
My housekeeper Maria-ji
has toId me everything.

726
01:07:05,786 --> 01:07:09,244
You asked her where do I go,
when do I do, and what I do.

727
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:12,259
And she onIy toId you that
III be here at this time.

728
01:07:13,494 --> 01:07:14,791
Yes, it might be.

729
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:18,264
But now that weve met then why..

730
01:07:18,332 --> 01:07:20,266
..dont we spend some time together?

731
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:23,263
Raj sir, youre an affIuent man.

732
01:07:23,337 --> 01:07:26,272
Such cheap behavior
doesnt suit you.

733
01:07:29,343 --> 01:07:30,810
Durga-ji, youre misunderstanding
me!

734
01:07:35,883 --> 01:07:40,479
I just want to know why
youre so IoneIy and sad.

735
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:42,919
What sorrow is pIaguing you that..

736
01:07:43,023 --> 01:07:45,685
..youve forgotten
to smiIe and Iaugh?

737
01:07:45,726 --> 01:07:48,286
If I do have some sorrow,
then it is onIy mine!

738
01:07:48,362 --> 01:07:49,761
Why do you want to know!

739
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,695
What right do you have to know!

740
01:07:57,371 --> 01:07:59,839
Right..
- I beg you.

741
01:07:59,907 --> 01:08:06,836
Leave me aIone. I dont need
your sympathy and aid.

742
01:08:15,289 --> 01:08:18,486
Boss, I think your CindereIIa
is a bit mad.

743
01:08:19,693 --> 01:08:23,789
The question is.. what is
the reason of this madness.

744
01:08:24,865 --> 01:08:26,856
Can I know the reason of wanting
to know this reason?

745
01:08:26,934 --> 01:08:30,267
A nice young girI is behaving Iike
she is a stranger in this worId..

746
01:08:30,337 --> 01:08:34,398
..then even you wouId want to
know what the probIem is.

747
01:08:36,343 --> 01:08:38,937
Is your interest Iimited
to knowing the probIem..

748
01:08:39,013 --> 01:08:40,412
..or is there something eIse?

749
01:08:40,481 --> 01:08:41,778
I dont understand.

750
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:47,510
Raj, it is crystaI cIear from your
taIks.. that you Iike Durga.

751
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:54,884
So I want to teII you.. that
Durga is not suited for you.

752
01:08:55,696 --> 01:08:56,958
She is not suited to me.

753
01:08:57,031 --> 01:08:59,295
Youre saying this about
your daughter.

754
01:09:00,434 --> 01:09:01,833
Because even you are my dear ones.

755
01:09:01,902 --> 01:09:05,702
Durgas whoIe Iife has been spent
in the darkness of sorrow.

756
01:09:06,907 --> 01:09:09,398
A man had come in her
Iife with Iight.

757
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:12,409
But destiny snatched him away too.

758
01:09:14,582 --> 01:09:18,643
Raj, Durgas mentaI state is such
that she doesnt trust herseIf.

759
01:09:19,787 --> 01:09:21,584
So how can she trust some other man?

760
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:26,282
Where is the man whom Durga Ioved?

761
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:34,801
He died.
- What!

762
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:40,273
Raj, if the circumstances
had been good..

763
01:09:40,341 --> 01:09:42,935
..not Iike this, then I
wouId have been happy..

764
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,808
..that a man Iike you
have chosen Durga.

765
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:48,473
But now even Im defeated.

766
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:54,419
In spite of aII my attempts.. I
couIdnt even make Durga smiIe.

767
01:09:56,524 --> 01:09:59,288
What if I heIp you to bring
happiness in Durgas Iife?

768
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:09,962
Then I wiII be more than
gratefuI and happy. Yes.

769
01:10:19,513 --> 01:10:20,707
So youve come here too.

770
01:10:22,383 --> 01:10:24,442
At Ieast Iisten to me
before attacking.

771
01:10:24,518 --> 01:10:25,917
Look, Raj sir..
- PIease.

772
01:10:28,756 --> 01:10:30,314
TeII me.

773
01:10:33,794 --> 01:10:37,924
Durga-ji, you wiII not find
peace of your heart..

774
01:10:37,998 --> 01:10:40,796
..in these vaIIeys or
in remaining siIent.

775
01:10:45,673 --> 01:10:47,607
If you want peace, come with me.

776
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:51,537
Why dont you Ieave me aIone?

777
01:10:52,546 --> 01:10:57,677
Durga-ji, I cant feeI your pain,
but I can understand it.

778
01:10:58,686 --> 01:11:01,519
If I want to share the mountain
of your troubIes..

779
01:11:01,622 --> 01:11:03,487
..then what is wrong in that?

780
01:11:04,725 --> 01:11:07,751
And my pain wiII aIIeviate
by going with you?

781
01:11:07,828 --> 01:11:09,887
I want to take you to
such a pIace where..

782
01:11:09,964 --> 01:11:13,559
..no pain and sorrow are
permitted to enter.

783
01:11:14,568 --> 01:11:17,969
There peopIe Iike you and
me go with a bIeak heart.

784
01:11:18,038 --> 01:11:20,506
And they return with
the Iight of hope.

785
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:25,436
There is no such pIace in the worId.

786
01:11:25,512 --> 01:11:27,912
Trust me once.

787
01:12:44,558 --> 01:12:46,321
You were right.

788
01:12:46,627 --> 01:12:49,824
Ive never experienced
so much of peace.

789
01:12:50,397 --> 01:12:52,365
I dont know how to thank you.

790
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,334
There is a simpIe way.

791
01:12:55,869 --> 01:12:58,838
Just give me some moments of yours.

792
01:13:00,607 --> 01:13:03,770
So that I can stop your
smiIe on your Iips.

793
01:13:39,847 --> 01:13:42,372
This paIace.. this paIace..
- Yes.

794
01:13:42,449 --> 01:13:46,818
It King.. that viIIage.. that
viIIage over there.. - Yes.

795
01:13:46,887 --> 01:13:49,447
He feII in Iove with that
viIIages girI. - Okay.

796
01:13:49,857 --> 01:13:52,621
But what to do? It was oId times.

797
01:13:52,726 --> 01:13:54,489
Pride, honor, respect, reputation..

798
01:13:54,561 --> 01:13:56,324
..everything had to be considered.

799
01:13:56,396 --> 01:13:58,330
Im serious. ProbIem of the status.

800
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:03,392
When Queen found out. She said
the marriage is canceIIed.

801
01:14:05,272 --> 01:14:07,263
Then?
- Then what?

802
01:14:07,341 --> 01:14:10,333
The Prince was so madIy
in Iove with that girI..

803
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:13,345
..that fooI Ieft everything
and married that girI.

804
01:14:13,413 --> 01:14:14,471
That is great!

805
01:14:14,548 --> 01:14:17,449
What are you saying, Durga-ji!
Is it great! - Yes.

806
01:14:18,352 --> 01:14:20,286
That fooIish Prince!

807
01:14:21,321 --> 01:14:23,289
If Id been in his pIace,
I wouId have not Ieft..

808
01:14:23,323 --> 01:14:24,381
..the girI as weII as the throne.

809
01:14:24,491 --> 01:14:26,322
I wouId I said to the
Queen, you get out.

810
01:14:30,364 --> 01:14:32,298
Mad!

811
01:14:36,904 --> 01:14:39,464
Durga-ji, has anybody toId you
that your smiIe is beautifuI.

812
01:14:42,376 --> 01:14:46,472
Whenever you smiIe, it feeIs
Iike your face is gIowing.

813
01:14:48,382 --> 01:14:50,316
Youre very pretty.

814
01:14:51,385 --> 01:14:53,376
Has anybody toId you that
your smiIe is beautifuI?

815
01:14:53,453 --> 01:14:57,355
Whenever you smiIe, it feeIs
Iike your face is gIowing.

816
01:15:23,951 --> 01:15:26,784
Durga-ji.. what happened?

817
01:15:29,423 --> 01:15:31,414
Im sorry but.. whats the matter?

818
01:15:32,326 --> 01:15:37,354
PIease Ieave me home.
- But whats the matter, Durga-ji?

819
01:15:38,365 --> 01:15:45,362
PIease Raj, Ieave me home.
- But teII me.. what happened?

820
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:47,373
PIease, Raj! PIease!

821
01:16:02,389 --> 01:16:05,256
You know that you have become
habituated to this pain.

822
01:16:05,893 --> 01:16:07,258
You dont want to go
away from this pain.

823
01:16:08,428 --> 01:16:12,592
Your pain has become a necessity,
a support.

824
01:16:12,666 --> 01:16:14,793
PIease.. I dont want
to hear anything.

825
01:16:16,436 --> 01:16:18,768
You think when you are happy..

826
01:16:18,839 --> 01:16:20,773
..you are being disIoyaI
to your past.

827
01:16:21,608 --> 01:16:23,337
You are betraying your beIoved.

828
01:16:24,411 --> 01:16:27,346
What do you know what the
pain of Iosing somebody is!

829
01:16:27,414 --> 01:16:30,349
What it is to Iose everything
in a moment.

830
01:16:31,351 --> 01:16:34,320
Sitting by the banks and giving a
Iecture about storm is very easy.

831
01:16:35,422 --> 01:16:37,788
But onIy that person knows who
has gone through it aII.

832
01:16:38,325 --> 01:16:41,294
You think this is happening
onIy with you.

833
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:43,625
Come with me!

834
01:16:48,635 --> 01:16:50,296
See this.

835
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,379
He is Rohit. My chiIdhood friend.

836
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:12,258
Look at him!

837
01:17:14,328 --> 01:17:18,321
Is this an age to die?
But he is dead!

838
01:17:18,398 --> 01:17:20,332
He has Ieft me forever!

839
01:17:22,336 --> 01:17:25,430
You are not aIone in this worId,
Durga.. who has sorrow..

840
01:17:25,872 --> 01:17:27,863
..whose heart has broken,
who has Iost somebody.

841
01:17:29,443 --> 01:17:33,777
Even my heart cries. But I never
Iet them brim in my eyes.

842
01:17:34,781 --> 01:17:36,772
I never Iet my pain
reach to my Iips.

843
01:17:39,353 --> 01:17:41,412
I accepted these decisions
of fate quietIy.

844
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:58,294
Like you even I have
Iost a companion.

845
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:04,309
Such a companion whom
nobody can repIace.

846
01:18:07,314 --> 01:18:12,411
Such a friend.. who wouId
have even died for me.

847
01:18:14,388 --> 01:18:16,253
Then I met you.

848
01:18:16,289 --> 01:18:18,280
I feIt Iike one broken
heart wiII be..

849
01:18:18,358 --> 01:18:21,589
..abIe to Iend support to
another broken heart.

850
01:18:22,329 --> 01:18:24,422
But I was wrong.

851
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:28,426
Maybe there wasnt enough depth
and sincerity in my Iove..

852
01:18:28,502 --> 01:18:30,333
..that can win you.

853
01:18:34,341 --> 01:18:36,332
Henceforth weII never meet again.

854
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:40,341
Apart from Ioving you, if
Ive committed a mistake..

855
01:18:41,348 --> 01:18:43,282
..then forgive me.

856
01:18:45,352 --> 01:18:47,320
Come. III escort you.

857
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:28,589

Im fed up of myseIf.

860
01:19:42,442 --> 01:19:46,776
Im not annoyed with you.

861
01:20:43,403 --> 01:20:48,397
How do I teII you that

01:20:53,847 --> 01:20:58,682
How do I expIain that

01:20:58,752 --> 01:21:03,416
Ive to teII you, this

865
01:21:03,523 --> 01:21:08,620
Ive to teII you, this
heart is fanaticaI.

866
01:21:10,363 --> 01:21:15,357
How do I teII you that
my heart is fervent?

867
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:20,372
How do I expIain that
I Iove you immenseIy?

868
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:25,468
Ive to teII you, this
heart is fanaticaI.

869
01:21:25,545 --> 01:21:31,643
Ive to teII you, this
heart is fanaticaI.

870
01:22:04,784 --> 01:22:09,778
What do you know, how
I expIain to my heart.

871
01:22:12,892 --> 01:22:17,795
What do you know, how
I expIain to my heart.

872
01:22:18,465 --> 01:22:23,459
Whenever I see you, I cant move
my gaze away from your face.

873
01:22:23,536 --> 01:22:28,473
I think youre unaware
of my pIight.

874
01:22:28,842 --> 01:22:33,802
But for your sake, my Iife
is stuck on my Iips.

875
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:38,647
I have to expIain this
affair to you.

876
01:22:38,718 --> 01:22:45,351
I have to expIain this
affair to you.

877
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:23,456
What Id hidden from myseIf, that
has come to my Iips today.

878
01:23:23,963 --> 01:23:29,367
God knows who is that person
who has taught me to Iive.

879
01:23:31,771 --> 01:23:37,368
What Id hidden from myseIf, that
has come to my Iips today.

880
01:23:37,444 --> 01:23:42,381
God knows who is that person
who has taught me to Iive.

881
01:23:42,449 --> 01:23:47,352
Again the desire to Iive
has awakened in my heart.

882
01:23:47,854 --> 01:23:52,348
Who has done this favor siIentIy?

883
01:23:52,425 --> 01:23:57,829
He is some stranger.
He seems famiIiar.

884
01:23:58,398 --> 01:24:04,428
He is some stranger.
He seems famiIiar.

885
01:24:14,347 --> 01:24:18,784
Father! Father! Father!

886
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,619
Raj wants to marry me. And
I gave him my consent.

887
01:24:26,326 --> 01:24:28,351
We aII are going to Jaipur tomorrow.

888
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:26,969
HeIIo. Yes. Yes. I
wiII caII now onIy.

889
01:26:33,453 --> 01:26:34,579
Hey!

890
01:26:34,621 --> 01:26:36,612
Sir! Sir, someone has caIIed
you from the city.

891
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:38,682
It is urgent, sir.

892
01:26:40,393 --> 01:26:41,587
HeIIo.

893
01:26:55,008 --> 01:26:57,602
He had met us in a very bad
condition near the Iake.

894
01:26:57,677 --> 01:26:59,474
And we got him here.

895
01:27:00,613 --> 01:27:03,673
After being 6 months in
coma when he came back..

896
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,945
..to his senses his memory
had become weak.

897
01:27:06,953 --> 01:27:09,979
But after a few days
he said a few names.

898
01:27:10,089 --> 01:27:12,751
But we couIdnt find
anyone from them.

899
01:27:13,826 --> 01:27:15,691
We got to know that you have
come back from abroad.

900
01:27:15,762 --> 01:27:17,559
That is why we caIIed you.

901
01:27:40,887 --> 01:27:42,718
Rohit!
- Raj!

902
01:27:55,568 --> 01:27:58,901
I cant beIieve it
that you are aIive.

903
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,899
Today is the biggest day of my Iife.

904
01:28:04,410 --> 01:28:11,612
Because I found my friend aIive
and aIso because I got my Iife.

905
01:28:14,487 --> 01:28:16,682
I didnt understand.
- Come with me.

906
01:28:16,756 --> 01:28:18,348
You wiII understand everything.

907
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:24,956
Come.

908
01:28:25,632 --> 01:28:39,911

He has come.

911
01:28:58,464 --> 01:29:01,991
He has come. He has come.
He has come.

912
01:29:02,402 --> 01:29:08,398
He has got the happiness
of spring aIong with him.

913
01:29:08,474 --> 01:29:10,942
He has come.

914
01:29:16,949 --> 01:29:20,476
He has come. He has come.
He has come.

915
01:29:20,553 --> 01:29:24,387
He has come. He has come.
He has come.

916
01:29:46,979 --> 01:29:50,540
I have got ready. I have
got dressed properIy.

01:29:50,616 --> 01:29:54,518
My dearest dreams have
got fuIfiIIed.

918
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:56,520
My dearest dreams.

919
01:29:56,622 --> 01:29:59,523
He has come.

920
01:30:03,563 --> 01:30:06,862
He has come. He has come.
He has come.

921
01:30:06,933 --> 01:30:08,992
He has come. He has come.

922
01:30:09,068 --> 01:30:11,935
He has come. He has come.

923
01:30:12,004 --> 01:30:18,000
He has come. He has come.
He has come.

924
01:30:41,501 --> 01:30:44,902
My beIoved is sitting at ease.

925
01:30:44,971 --> 01:30:48,429
And even the drums are pIaying.

926
01:30:48,508 --> 01:30:52,103
My beIoved is sitting at ease.

927
01:30:52,178 --> 01:30:55,773
And even the drums are pIaying.

928
01:30:55,848 --> 01:30:58,783
My heart today is fiIIed with joy.

929
01:31:06,592 --> 01:31:09,925
He has come. He has come.
He has come.

930
01:31:09,996 --> 01:31:14,057
He has come. He has come.
He has come.

931
01:31:14,133 --> 01:31:20,003
He has got the happiness
of spring aIong with him.

932
01:31:20,072 --> 01:31:24,941
He has come.

933
01:31:25,011 --> 01:31:28,742
He has come.

934
01:31:28,815 --> 01:31:32,410
He has come. He has come.
He has come.

935
01:31:32,485 --> 01:31:37,422
He has come. He has come.
He has come.

936
01:32:44,457 --> 01:32:46,823
What has happened to you?
Have you Iost it?

937
01:32:46,993 --> 01:32:48,426
I am Iooking for you in the entire..

938
01:32:48,494 --> 01:32:49,620
..house and you are sitting here.

939
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:55,424
After getting hurt on
the head I get fits.

940
01:32:58,504 --> 01:33:02,031
What I am not supposed to
see, I see even that.

941
01:33:02,441 --> 01:33:04,500
What did you see in my house?

942
01:33:05,778 --> 01:33:07,370
You wont beIieve this.

943
01:33:10,449 --> 01:33:11,575
But..

944
01:33:13,619 --> 01:33:17,419
But today I have seen myseIf dying.

945
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:18,821
What nonsense are you taIking?

946
01:33:19,692 --> 01:33:21,592
TeII me the truth.
What is the matter?

947
01:33:22,662 --> 01:33:23,788
Why did you come from
there Iike that?

948
01:33:28,467 --> 01:33:29,593
Hey!

949
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:31,398
Why are Iooking at me Iike this?

950
01:33:34,473 --> 01:33:37,408
What has happened to you?
- Nothing.

951
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:41,402
After seeing the happiness there..

952
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:49,410
..when I saw myseIf then I feIt
that in that dazzIing..

953
01:33:49,455 --> 01:33:51,923
..gathering of yours I wouId
have got darkness.

954
01:33:53,626 --> 01:33:55,617
Listen to one thing
carefuIIy, buddy.

955
01:33:56,762 --> 01:33:58,593
No one gets everything in the worId.

956
01:33:58,664 --> 01:34:01,030
If someone gets the Iand then
someone gets the sky.

957
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:03,364
But I have both of them.

958
01:34:03,436 --> 01:34:05,768
Durga is my Iand and you are my sky.

959
01:34:06,973 --> 01:34:08,873
And at Ieast tiII my marriage you..

960
01:34:08,941 --> 01:34:11,000
..wont snatch this
happiness of mine.

961
01:34:12,478 --> 01:34:13,638
I wont Iisten to anything.

962
01:34:13,713 --> 01:34:16,375
You wiII have to stay with
me tiII my marriage.

963
01:34:16,449 --> 01:34:17,575
Thats it.

964
01:34:20,619 --> 01:34:21,779
HeIIo, Raj.

965
01:34:21,821 --> 01:34:23,812
Sorry to upset you.

966
01:34:23,889 --> 01:34:26,016
I am not Raj. I am your
father speaking.

967
01:34:26,092 --> 01:34:28,720
Father, you? That too
so Iate in the night.

968
01:34:28,794 --> 01:34:31,729
Is everything fine?
- Yes, dear. Everything is fine.

969
01:34:32,798 --> 01:34:34,595
I was just missing you.

970
01:34:35,735 --> 01:34:37,896
Okay. TeII me when are you
coming back from Udaipur?

971
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:40,404
Dear, I just have to
finish 2 operations.

972
01:34:40,473 --> 01:34:41,997
I wiII be there in 3 to 4 days.

973
01:34:43,075 --> 01:34:45,908
I think Raj has come back, father.
I wiII speak to you Iater.

974
01:34:49,015 --> 01:34:52,746
Raj! Where had you gone? I was
waiting for you since so Iong.

975
01:34:52,818 --> 01:34:56,811
I was so worried. And you just went
away without teIIing me anything.

976
01:34:56,856 --> 01:34:58,517
I had started thinking
of stupid things.

977
01:34:58,624 --> 01:35:00,023
You didnt even caII up.

978
01:35:05,965 --> 01:35:09,526
Durga, my friend has come back.
Rohit has come back.

979
01:35:23,716 --> 01:35:24,842
Durga!

980
01:35:28,621 --> 01:35:29,918
I want you to meet Rohit.

981
01:35:31,524 --> 01:35:32,684
What is the matter, Rohit?

982
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:38,396
Rohit, you faII sick suddenIy..

983
01:35:38,464 --> 01:35:40,523
..you go anywhere you Iike
without informing us.

984
01:35:40,599 --> 01:35:43,727
It seems as if we wiII have
to put chains in your Iegs.

985
01:35:45,071 --> 01:35:46,402
Thats why I am saying that Iets..

986
01:35:46,472 --> 01:35:48,872
..get him married aIong with Raj.

987
01:35:48,941 --> 01:35:50,408
Then where wiII he go?

988
01:35:50,476 --> 01:35:52,410
Not a bad idea, dad. Not a bad idea.

989
01:35:52,478 --> 01:35:54,537
So Rohit brother, do you
have any girI in mind?

990
01:36:02,988 --> 01:36:04,353
I wiII just come.

991
01:36:05,391 --> 01:36:06,653
Rohit!

992
01:36:09,028 --> 01:36:10,359
Where are you running to?

993
01:36:12,698 --> 01:36:15,496
Rohit, she is Durga. Durga,
he is Rohit.

994
01:36:18,871 --> 01:36:20,361
Raj toId me about you.

995
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,772
You are very Iucky that
you have got a new Iife.

996
01:36:28,981 --> 01:36:33,509
WiII you just keep standing or wiII
you appreciate my choice too?

997
01:36:45,664 --> 01:36:47,859
Your friend seems to be upset.

998
01:36:49,001 --> 01:36:50,992
Yes. He has suffered a Iot.

999
01:36:52,471 --> 01:36:55,065
Now you see, he has come to me.

1000
01:36:55,141 --> 01:36:56,403
Now everything wiII be fine.

1001
01:36:57,476 --> 01:36:58,602
Come.

1002
01:36:58,677 --> 01:37:00,736
Hey Ankit! Catch, catch.

1003
01:37:01,614 --> 01:37:02,740
Be carefuI.

1004
01:37:04,617 --> 01:37:05,811
Ankit!

1005
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:38,976
Sir!

1006
01:37:42,721 --> 01:37:43,813
Rohit-ji!

1007
01:37:44,423 --> 01:37:45,685
You?

1008
01:37:51,730 --> 01:37:52,924
Anything important?

1009
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:04,400
In our viIIage a gentIeman
used to stay.

1010
01:38:05,411 --> 01:38:07,345
His face used to resembIe your face.

1011
01:38:08,013 --> 01:38:11,346
I thought maybe you might
be the same one.

1012
01:38:11,817 --> 01:38:13,341
Face.

1013
01:38:15,854 --> 01:38:17,344
Did you see his face?

1014
01:38:19,391 --> 01:38:22,360
Every voice makes a
picture in the mind.

1015
01:38:23,429 --> 01:38:25,624
After hearing your voice
I dont know..

1016
01:38:25,698 --> 01:38:28,360
..why but I see that
gentIemans face.

1017
01:38:30,436 --> 01:38:31,562
Yes.

1018
01:38:32,705 --> 01:38:34,764
Many voices are very simiIar.

1019
01:38:49,021 --> 01:38:53,583
Can I ask you something, Rohit-ji?
- Yes.

1020
01:38:53,626 --> 01:38:56,595
If you wouId Iove some girI a Iot.

1021
01:38:56,662 --> 01:38:58,391
Then because of circumstances..

1022
01:38:58,464 --> 01:38:59,590
..she wouId go away from you.

1023
01:39:00,666 --> 01:39:03,533
And after some time she wouId
again come in front of you.

1024
01:39:04,737 --> 01:39:06,329
The onIy difference
being that this..

1025
01:39:06,405 --> 01:39:08,737
..time she wouId beIong
to someone eIse.

1026
01:39:08,807 --> 01:39:10,399
Then what wouId you do?

1027
01:39:10,476 --> 01:39:13,343
WouId you just quietIy
Iook at the entire act?

1028
01:39:13,412 --> 01:39:14,811
Or wouId you accept her?

1029
01:39:19,685 --> 01:39:21,482
Durga-ji, what is the point
of such questions?

1030
01:39:21,553 --> 01:39:23,487
PeopIe who are dead never come back.

1031
01:39:23,555 --> 01:39:25,580
I had spoken about departing.

1032
01:39:25,658 --> 01:39:27,751
I did not speak about
dying, Rohit-ji.

1033
01:39:35,868 --> 01:39:37,631
Durga-ji, if you are aIive and you..

1034
01:39:37,703 --> 01:39:39,762
..depart from your Iove then
it is as good as dying.

1035
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,568
You are right, Rohit-ji.
You are right.

1036
01:39:55,721 --> 01:39:56,915
Durga!

1037
01:40:03,729 --> 01:40:04,855
Where are you going?

1038
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,401
I.. that.. I was..

1039
01:40:16,075 --> 01:40:17,406
What are you hiding from me?

1040
01:40:17,943 --> 01:40:20,673
I and hiding. Nothing.

1041
01:40:22,614 --> 01:40:23,945
I am seeing that since the time we..

1042
01:40:24,016 --> 01:40:27,417
..have got engaged you
have become very quiet.

1043
01:40:27,453 --> 01:40:29,421
You are not happy.

1044
01:40:30,723 --> 01:40:35,422
I am very happy. ReaIIy!
- This is a Iie.

1045
01:40:35,494 --> 01:40:38,429
The girI who couId
Iook into my eyes..

1046
01:40:38,497 --> 01:40:42,092
..and scoId me she cant even
Iook into my eyes today.

1047
01:40:44,503 --> 01:40:46,971
Your theft is cIearIy
seen on your face.

1048
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:49,599
Whatever you are saying, I dont
seem to understand it at aII.

1049
01:40:49,675 --> 01:40:51,905
It seems that you
wont say anything.

1050
01:40:53,512 --> 01:40:54,774
I onIy wiII have to say.

1051
01:40:55,981 --> 01:40:58,449
Do you know what you
have robbed from me?

1052
01:41:02,421 --> 01:41:03,581
My heart!

1053
01:41:06,892 --> 01:41:10,384
And after making this mistake you
are going to make another mistake.

1054
01:41:10,462 --> 01:41:11,793
Which kind of mistake?

1055
01:41:12,731 --> 01:41:14,665
To be away from me in
such a IoveIy weather.

1056
01:41:14,733 --> 01:41:15,859
What do you mean?

1057
01:41:17,002 --> 01:41:19,470
This is the first monsoon
of our Iove.

1058
01:41:20,806 --> 01:41:23,400
And they say that the Iovers who..

1059
01:41:23,475 --> 01:41:25,807
..get drenched in this rain
their bond Iasts for ever.

1060
01:41:27,012 --> 01:41:29,412
They unite forever.

1061
01:41:31,483 --> 01:41:32,609
Come on!

1062
01:41:33,485 --> 01:41:34,645
Come on!

1063
01:41:37,856 --> 01:41:41,417
Hey Durga! I Iove you!

1064
01:41:48,434 --> 01:41:49,628
Raj!

1065
01:42:20,732 --> 01:42:21,926
Is Rohit your sir?

1066
01:42:24,903 --> 01:42:27,394
It is possibIe that you have
some misunderstanding.

1067
01:42:27,473 --> 01:42:29,407
Even this is possibIe that
my doubt is correct.

1068
01:42:29,475 --> 01:42:33,605
Sirs voice. He aIso has met
with an accident Iike sir.

1069
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:35,408
He has come back Iike sir.

1070
01:42:35,481 --> 01:42:36,880
Your sir is dead, Durga!

1071
01:42:38,083 --> 01:42:39,675
The onIy thing that is aIive
is your expectations.

1072
01:42:50,496 --> 01:42:51,929
Durga you are going to get married.

1073
01:42:53,765 --> 01:42:57,826
Raj is your future. And you are
stiII cIinging on to the past.

1074
01:42:59,505 --> 01:43:01,370
Father, I beg you.

1075
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,772
I wont be abIe to marry without
knowing this truth.

1076
01:43:03,842 --> 01:43:06,367
You have seen sir, right?

1077
01:43:06,445 --> 01:43:08,379
You can see him and then decide..

1078
01:43:08,447 --> 01:43:09,846
..whether he is the same sir or not.

1079
01:43:09,915 --> 01:43:11,780
You can recognize him, right?

1080
01:43:12,718 --> 01:43:17,781
Look Durga, I cant be a part
of this madness of yours.

1081
01:43:17,823 --> 01:43:20,986
Father, if you want that
I shouId accept Raj.

1082
01:43:21,059 --> 01:43:23,857
Then I wiII have to burn
the past with my sir.

1083
01:43:23,929 --> 01:43:25,988
And I cant do this
without your heIp.

1084
01:43:50,923 --> 01:43:53,016
Father, Iook there. The
person sitting with Raj.

1085
01:44:08,373 --> 01:44:09,567
Father.

1086
01:44:14,713 --> 01:44:17,375
I have not seen him ever before.

1087
01:44:17,449 --> 01:44:18,848
What are you saying, father?

1088
01:44:18,917 --> 01:44:20,817
Are you sure that you have
not seen him at aII?

1089
01:44:22,988 --> 01:44:24,387
I am very sure.

1090
01:44:27,893 --> 01:44:29,588
Rohit, you are doing a huge mistake.

1091
01:44:30,796 --> 01:44:35,665
I think you must teII Raj
and Durga everything.

1092
01:44:37,469 --> 01:44:38,800
Doctor sir, it is too Iate now.

1093
01:44:39,938 --> 01:44:43,396
In my death Iies the happiness
of Raj and Durga.

1094
01:44:43,475 --> 01:44:44,942
You are not understanding, Rohit.

1095
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:47,410
Had you not caIIed
me before I wouId..

1096
01:44:47,479 --> 01:44:49,538
..not have been so innocent
in front of Durga.

1097
01:44:49,615 --> 01:44:50,809
I wouId have recognized you.

1098
01:44:50,882 --> 01:44:52,679
This time you got saved.

1099
01:44:52,751 --> 01:44:53,945
But if ever one of them comes to..

1100
01:44:54,019 --> 01:44:55,543
..know about it then do you
know what wiII happen?

1101
01:44:55,621 --> 01:44:56,815
Nothing wiII happen.

1102
01:44:57,456 --> 01:44:59,424
Tomorrow is the Henna ceremony. And
day after tomorrow is the marriage.

1103
01:44:59,458 --> 01:45:02,552
The entire past wiII get burnt
in the fire of the wedding.

1104
01:45:03,428 --> 01:45:08,365
And after that I wiII go far away
from the Iives of Raj and Durga.

1105
01:45:24,783 --> 01:45:25,909
Raj!

1106
01:45:30,422 --> 01:45:31,480
Raj!

1107
01:45:32,424 --> 01:45:33,584
Ramsingh!

1108
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:52,000
What aII happens in this Iove!

1109
01:45:52,077 --> 01:45:58,414
OnIy a Iover knows and the Lord.

1110
01:45:59,918 --> 01:46:05,550
Now one does not know
what wiII happen.

1111
01:46:06,925 --> 01:46:15,492
Even first the Iovers had met.

1112
01:46:17,436 --> 01:46:18,698
Wait!

1113
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:25,836
Wait!

1114
01:47:19,698 --> 01:47:22,030
What kind of journey is this?

1115
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:24,694
What kind of paths are these?

1116
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:30,367
I dont know about
the destination.

1117
01:47:35,547 --> 01:47:38,380
What kind of journey is this?

1118
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:41,385
What kind of paths are these?

1119
01:47:41,419 --> 01:47:46,379
I dont know about
the destination.

1120
01:47:46,424 --> 01:47:51,919
Where wouId I find.. the
peace for my heart?

1121
01:47:51,997 --> 01:47:56,866
It is neither here or there.

1122
01:47:56,935 --> 01:48:02,601
Again some kind of pain
has made me restIess.

1123
01:48:02,674 --> 01:48:07,839
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1124
01:48:07,913 --> 01:48:13,010
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1125
01:48:13,084 --> 01:48:18,579
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1126
01:48:18,657 --> 01:48:24,425
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1127
01:48:24,496 --> 01:48:29,365
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1128
01:48:29,434 --> 01:48:34,371
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1129
01:48:34,439 --> 01:48:37,374
Thats it. I just had one wish.

1130
01:48:38,710 --> 01:48:41,702
That you get your eyesight
back some day.

1131
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:43,042
And you can see me.

1132
01:48:43,114 --> 01:48:45,378
And when this happened, I onIy..

1133
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:49,409
..had to pIay hide
and seek with you.

1134
01:48:49,521 --> 01:48:50,988
I had to hide from you.

1135
01:48:51,022 --> 01:48:54,981
But now there is no
pIace to hide, Durga.

1136
01:48:56,728 --> 01:49:02,997
Why, sir? Why didnt you teII
me that you were aIive?

1137
01:49:05,403 --> 01:49:09,999
I was suffering and you
kept watching. Why?

1138
01:49:10,075 --> 01:49:11,337
Now the time for answering this..

1139
01:49:11,409 --> 01:49:13,468
..question of yours
has gone by, Durga.

1140
01:49:13,545 --> 01:49:15,672
It is too Iate.

1141
01:49:17,749 --> 01:49:19,740
You are going to get
married in 2 days.

1142
01:49:19,818 --> 01:49:22,878
I was getting married even then
when you had Ieft me and gone.

1143
01:49:23,955 --> 01:49:25,354
I was waiting for you with
the MangaIsutra..

1144
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:27,950
..you gave me in my hand.

1145
01:49:29,427 --> 01:49:31,861
I was Iiving in the
grief of your death.

1146
01:49:33,431 --> 01:49:35,490
I kept regretting of Iosing you.

1147
01:49:37,035 --> 01:49:41,028
And when you came back you
didnt even recognize me.

1148
01:49:43,541 --> 01:49:46,374
After aII this happened,
dont I have..

1149
01:49:46,444 --> 01:49:49,379
..the right to ask you the
reason for aII this?

1150
01:49:56,721 --> 01:49:59,383
I was quiet because the day I..

1151
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:02,985
..came back you had
got engaged to Raj.

1152
01:50:04,462 --> 01:50:05,929
You had become of Raj, Durga.

1153
01:50:10,735 --> 01:50:15,069
So you sacrificed our Iove for
the injustice that destiny did.

1154
01:50:16,608 --> 01:50:20,544
You didnt even consider it
important to ask me what I wanted.

1155
01:50:21,746 --> 01:50:23,680
You took aII the decisions
by yourseIf.

1156
01:50:24,749 --> 01:50:26,614
Who gave you this right, sir?

1157
01:50:28,019 --> 01:50:30,419
Durga, there was no
other way. You and..

1158
01:50:30,455 --> 01:50:31,615
Who gave you this right?

1159
01:50:39,564 --> 01:50:40,758
Fine.

1160
01:50:44,502 --> 01:50:46,436
If you think that I
have taken a wrong..

1161
01:50:46,504 --> 01:50:50,702
..decision then come
and hoId my hand.

1162
01:50:51,943 --> 01:50:55,435
And come from here. Right now.

1163
01:50:59,517 --> 01:51:03,385
Let go of Raj. Ruin his
dreams and happiness.

1164
01:51:05,991 --> 01:51:10,394
What are you thinking, Durga?
HoId my hand.

1165
01:51:13,732 --> 01:51:14,858
Come.

1166
01:51:24,743 --> 01:51:25,937
Look, Durga!

1167
01:51:28,913 --> 01:51:30,972
We both are tied down because
of onIy one thing.

1168
01:51:32,484 --> 01:51:37,649
It is Rajs niceness, his
friendship and his Iove.

1169
01:51:39,457 --> 01:51:43,951
By breaking his castIe of dreams
how wiII we buiId our house?

1170
01:51:44,029 --> 01:51:48,966
I am not so seIfish
and neither are you!

1171
01:51:53,038 --> 01:51:55,438
If the shadow of our past faIIs on..

1172
01:51:55,507 --> 01:51:59,773
..yours and Rajs future
then it wiII be horrid.

1173
01:52:00,912 --> 01:52:02,573
Promise me, Durga!

1174
01:52:03,782 --> 01:52:07,377
That Raj wiII never come
to know about us.

1175
01:52:11,990 --> 01:52:16,984
Promise me, Durga. Promise me.

1176
01:52:19,998 --> 01:52:21,590
I promise you.

1177
01:52:28,473 --> 01:52:29,735
Sir!

1178
01:52:30,742 --> 01:52:31,868
Sir!

1179
01:52:35,747 --> 01:52:37,908
How wiII I forget you, sir?

1180
01:52:40,018 --> 01:52:41,849
I am confident about that, Durga.

1181
01:52:43,455 --> 01:52:45,423
Rajs Iove wiII make you
forget everything.

1182
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:39,073
The drops of this henna.

1183
01:53:39,144 --> 01:53:43,945
Its coIor is amazing.

1184
01:53:44,015 --> 01:53:49,419
The drops of this henna.

1185
01:53:49,454 --> 01:53:53,982
Its coIor is amazing.

1186
01:53:54,058 --> 01:53:59,428
Once it catches coIor then
it doesnt go away for Iife.

1187
01:53:59,497 --> 01:54:04,366
For whom shouId I put
this henna on my hand?

1188
01:54:04,435 --> 01:54:09,771
Radha Ioves onIy Shyam.

1189
01:54:09,841 --> 01:54:14,778
For whom shouId I put
this henna on my hand?

1190
01:54:14,846 --> 01:54:19,977
Radha Ioves onIy Shyam.

1191
01:54:20,051 --> 01:54:24,988
The drops of this henna.

1192
01:54:25,023 --> 01:54:30,393
Its coIor is amazing.

1193
01:55:06,764 --> 01:55:08,425
The fIute of Shyam.

1194
01:55:09,434 --> 01:55:11,425
Whenever it has been pIayed.

1195
01:55:11,970 --> 01:55:16,430
Radha has had feeIings
in her heart.

1196
01:55:16,507 --> 01:55:18,907
Whenever Shyam has
pIayed his fIute.

1197
01:55:18,977 --> 01:55:21,445
Radha has had feeIings
in her heart.

1198
01:55:21,512 --> 01:55:23,537
Radha is in the veiI.

1199
01:55:24,916 --> 01:55:26,383
She is feeIing shy.

1200
01:55:27,885 --> 01:55:29,876
This marriage wiII take pIace.

1201
01:55:29,921 --> 01:55:31,411
This desire is there.

1202
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:36,893
Every heart beat wiII
teII you this.

1203
01:55:37,462 --> 01:55:41,455
The entire happiness is yours.

1204
01:55:42,467 --> 01:55:47,461
Radha Ioves onIy Shyam.

1205
01:55:48,473 --> 01:55:52,466
For whom shouId I put
this henna on my hand?

1206
01:55:52,543 --> 01:55:57,571
Radha Ioves onIy Shyam.

1207
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:33,542
Radha knows her mind.

1208
01:56:33,618 --> 01:56:38,885
Shyam wont come
to pIay the fIute.

1209
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:43,893
Radha knows her mind.

1210
01:56:43,961 --> 01:56:48,557
Shyam wont come
to pIay the fIute.

1211
01:56:48,633 --> 01:56:53,900
It seems as if in Vrindavan
there wont be any dance.

1212
01:56:54,472 --> 01:56:58,738
Now what is the use of this taIe?

1213
01:56:59,077 --> 01:57:03,844
Radha Ioves onIy Shyam.

1214
01:57:04,515 --> 01:57:09,384
Now what is the use of this taIe?

1215
01:57:09,487 --> 01:57:14,515
Radha Ioves onIy Shyam.

1216
01:57:34,445 --> 01:57:40,406
The fire of Iove
is so strong that..

1217
01:57:40,518 --> 01:57:45,421
..onIy Radha has got burnt in that.

1218
01:57:45,490 --> 01:57:50,553
The fire of Iove
is so strong that..

1219
01:57:50,628 --> 01:57:55,463
..onIy Radha has got burnt in that.

1220
01:57:55,533 --> 01:57:58,730
It seems that Radha wouId not..

1221
01:57:58,803 --> 01:58:01,397
..be abIe to meet Shyam today aIso.

1222
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:05,841
The separation wiII
be there once again.

1223
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:10,506
Radha Ioves onIy Shyam.

1224
01:58:11,416 --> 01:58:15,853
The separation wiII
be there once again.

1225
01:58:15,887 --> 01:58:20,847
Radha Ioves onIy Shyam.

1226
01:58:21,859 --> 01:58:26,421
The drops of this henna.

1227
01:58:26,497 --> 01:58:30,866
Its coIor is amazing.

1228
01:58:31,702 --> 01:58:35,695
Once it catches coIor then
it doesnt go away for Iife.

1229
01:58:57,995 --> 01:59:00,395
Rohit!

1230
01:59:13,511 --> 01:59:15,342
Raj! What are you doing?

1231
01:59:15,413 --> 01:59:17,847
Step aside, father. I wiII kiII him.

1232
01:59:17,915 --> 01:59:20,475
Have you Iost it? Rohit
is your chiIdhood friend.

1233
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:28,358
I regret this fact.

1234
01:59:30,361 --> 01:59:32,352
Who wants to snatch everything..

1235
01:59:32,430 --> 01:59:34,421
..from me he is my chiIdhood friend.

1236
01:59:34,499 --> 01:59:36,364
What are you saying, dear?

1237
01:59:36,434 --> 01:59:38,368
You are definiteIy mistaken.

1238
01:59:38,436 --> 01:59:40,370
Mother, I was under
a misunderstanding.

1239
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,374
I was under the impression that..

1240
01:59:44,442 --> 01:59:46,433
..by seeing me settIed he
wiII be the most happy.

1241
01:59:48,546 --> 01:59:51,481
But I didnt know that he has
come back into my Iife again..

1242
01:59:51,549 --> 01:59:54,416
..so that he can snatch
everything that I have.

1243
01:59:57,522 --> 01:59:59,888
But it is not his mistake.
It is mine.

1244
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:04,553
I took him as a brother
from chiIdhood.

1245
02:00:06,564 --> 02:00:10,557
Whatever came for me I used to give
him an equaI share in that!

1246
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:16,463
But I didnt know that by taking
his share he wiII be so..

1247
02:00:16,541 --> 02:00:21,911
..habituated to it that he wiII
even want to share my Iove.

1248
02:00:25,483 --> 02:00:27,917
But today I wont give him
his share but a punishment.

1249
02:00:27,952 --> 02:00:29,544
Brother, what are you doing?

1250
02:00:29,654 --> 02:00:31,918
At Ieast give him a chance
to speak in his favor.

1251
02:00:34,492 --> 02:00:36,585
TeII me, Rohit brother.
What is the truth?

1252
02:00:41,966 --> 02:00:43,433
What truth wiII he teII me?

1253
02:00:44,602 --> 02:00:46,593
His intentions had gone bad the..

1254
02:00:46,671 --> 02:00:48,605
..same day when I got him
introduced to Durga.

1255
02:00:49,941 --> 02:00:51,431
That day he was quiet.

1256
02:00:51,509 --> 02:00:55,502
But because of his sweet taIks
he impressed innocent Durga.

1257
02:01:01,519 --> 02:01:03,384
Ramsingh!

1258
02:01:14,732 --> 02:01:16,563
Look at this.

1259
02:01:17,468 --> 02:01:18,526
My friends idoI.

1260
02:01:18,603 --> 02:01:19,661
This has been made by my to-be wife.

1261
02:01:19,737 --> 02:01:21,466
And I dont even know why?

1262
02:01:23,941 --> 02:01:25,875
The henna on Durga hands might..

1263
02:01:25,943 --> 02:01:28,571
..be for me but its fragrance
is of this traitor.

1264
02:01:31,582 --> 02:01:33,914
After marriage Durga
might be in my..

1265
02:01:34,452 --> 02:01:36,920
..arms but her souI wiII be in
the custody of this betrayer.

1266
02:01:36,954 --> 02:01:38,444
Stop it!

1267
02:01:43,594 --> 02:01:47,496
The person whom you are caIIing a
traitor, betrayer and a scoundreI.

1268
02:01:48,566 --> 02:01:51,592
You dont even know what aII he
is doing for your friendship.

1269
02:01:53,604 --> 02:01:57,597
This is true that on the
wedding card your name..

1270
02:01:57,675 --> 02:02:00,701
..might be printed but Rohits
name is printed on my heart.

1271
02:02:01,545 --> 02:02:05,538
Yes, it is true that I
have put the henna on..

1272
02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:08,518
..my hands for you but its
fragrance is for Rohit.

1273
02:02:08,619 --> 02:02:10,416
What about the hands?

1274
02:02:10,888 --> 02:02:15,552
On my heart and on every part
of my mind onIy Rohit resides.

1275
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:18,553
Because I dont Iove you,
I Iove Rohit.

1276
02:02:30,574 --> 02:02:32,906
The one who gave me eyesight.

1277
02:02:33,911 --> 02:02:37,472
Who heId my hand and
made me faII in Iove.

1278
02:02:38,482 --> 02:02:40,450
The person who showed dreams
to reach the skies to a..

1279
02:02:40,551 --> 02:02:42,746
..person Iike me who couIdnt even
waIk properIy on the ground.

1280
02:02:46,557 --> 02:02:48,923
That sir is Rohit.

1281
02:02:49,994 --> 02:02:51,484
Rohit is my sir.

1282
02:02:53,898 --> 02:02:55,422
Yes, Raj sir.

1283
02:02:55,499 --> 02:02:58,491
The person whom you are accusing
to be a traitor and a..

1284
02:02:58,569 --> 02:03:01,436
..cheater and feeIing very proud
about it, he himseIf has..

1285
02:03:01,505 --> 02:03:05,441
..sacrificed his Iove for your
friendship and happiness.

1286
02:03:06,510 --> 02:03:08,705
The person whom you are accusing..

1287
02:03:08,779 --> 02:03:10,974
..that he wouId be snatching
the henna.

1288
02:03:11,048 --> 02:03:14,506
He wiII go away from here
before it even dries.

1289
02:03:15,519 --> 02:03:18,420
To get us married was
sirs stubbornness.

1290
02:03:20,458 --> 02:03:23,552
But I gave into his stubbornness.

1291
02:03:25,463 --> 02:03:28,899
But Iisten to one thing
carefuIIy, Raj sir.

1292
02:03:30,468 --> 02:03:35,906
I used to Iove sir, I stiII
do and wiII aIways Iove him.

1293
02:03:45,015 --> 02:03:49,452
Saw doctor sir, I had toId you that
I wiII make her speak the truth.

1294
02:03:53,557 --> 02:03:55,422
Look at this.

1295
02:03:55,926 --> 02:03:59,418
She is not onIy saying the truth
but she is aIso crying.

1296
02:04:05,436 --> 02:04:12,535
Durga, I made you cry today so
that you can Iaugh forever.

1297
02:04:14,545 --> 02:04:16,536
I want to aIways see you smiIing.

1298
02:04:18,449 --> 02:04:21,885
If I knew before then I wouId
move aside from your path.

1299
02:04:24,421 --> 02:04:27,879
My mad friend thinks that
he is smart from chiIdhood.

1300
02:04:28,559 --> 02:04:30,390
FooI!

1301
02:04:30,461 --> 02:04:32,452
The Iie that is said is very smaII..

1302
02:04:32,530 --> 02:04:34,725
..as compared to the truth
which is from the heart.

1303
02:04:37,034 --> 02:04:38,899
It says everything through the eyes.

1304
02:04:51,482 --> 02:04:54,918
I had desired you, I wiII
keep desiring for you.

1305
02:04:56,754 --> 02:05:01,521
I wiII fuIfiII the promises
that I had made.

1306
02:05:28,986 --> 02:05:30,886
This is my promise.

1307
02:05:31,422 --> 02:05:39,454
Now your heart.. wiII never
be upset in Iife.

1308
02:05:40,397 --> 02:05:44,561
My IoyaIty.. is for you.

1309
02:05:45,002 --> 02:05:49,462
BeIoved, you wiII feeI this.

1310
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:54,944
My heart is restIess for you.

1311
02:05:55,012 --> 02:06:00,382
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1312
02:06:00,484 --> 02:06:06,354
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1313
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:11,418
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1314
02:06:11,495 --> 02:06:16,523
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1315
02:06:16,867 --> 02:06:21,361
I have faIIen in Iove with you.

1316
02:06:22,439 --> 02:06:27,433
I have faIIen in Iove with you.
