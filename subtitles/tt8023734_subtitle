- Good for heart- Very good, sir

260
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,210

No one in this villagewill pay heed to me and vote

265
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,300
I don't need the villagers' votes

266
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,630
It's enough if peoplein your clan vote for me

267
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,000
You aren't just another person here

- All that is fake- Really...?

272
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,210
I didn't know about it all along

273
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,710
Instead of going aroundthe world like Lord Muruga...

274
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,300
...I want to faithfully followyour footsteps like Lord Ganesha

275
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,000

00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,050
He has gone to plough the fields

282
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,210
Why don't you do this?

283
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,170
My granddaughter's ear-piercingceremony is on January 24th

Good family

290
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,170

Son-in-law, have you invited everyone?

295
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,420
Whenever we celebrate a function...

296
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,380
...some of our relativesnurse a grouse and don't turn up

297
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,750
At least in this functionbring everyone together

298
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,550
- Sure, uncle- Why have a family feud?

299
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,500
Sister, invite him too

300
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,670
He's my teacher tooNot yours alone

301
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,340
Kindly attend my children'sear-piercing ceremony

302
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,050
Bro-in-law, you've added their degreeas suffix to all the names

303
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,130
But it's missing in my name

304
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,300
They all are well educatedso we added their qualifications

305
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,500
But you've passed only 10th grade

306
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,710
You've added Dr for the doctors

307
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,630
Er for Engineers

308
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Even for bro-in-law Vadivelu you haveadded 'Press' as a prestige symbol

309
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,170
For an agriculturist, you could haveadded 'farmer' as suffix proudly, right?

310
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,210
People will laugh if I do that

311
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,750
I'll hit those who laughwith my slippers

312
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,380
Print 'Gunasingam'

313
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,000
Followed by 'Farmer'

314
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,670
It will look dignified

315
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,380
Even I earn 1.5 lakhs per month

316
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,340
All occupations have retirement

317
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,500
Only a farmer never retires you know

318
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,500
Nowadays people need to be remindedfarming is our national occupation!

319
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,050

- You write 'farmer' on the invitation- Sure, uncle

324
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,210

Girls who look at you smile brightlylike a 1000 watts bulb

Look how this Andalis impressing her uncle

357
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,920
Hypocrite!

358
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,210
I think everyone will decideshe is Miss Right for him

359
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,880
How is that possible?

360
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,590
What are we here for?

361
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,420
No one can change Poompozhil Chellammafrom marrying our brother

362
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,420
He was born from our mother's womb

363
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,130
Not our mother's sister's womb

364
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,130
'Legislature is in session'

365
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,550
Uncle

366
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,170
Did you notice?

367
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,550
Your 5 sisters will show offto the world as if they are so united

368
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,380
But there are 2 factions within

369
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,800
One is A division

370
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,380
Other is B division

371
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,670
Let the function get overWatch the fun

372
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,460
See how they poke at each other!

373
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,170
The children are blessed to havean uncle and grandfather like you both

374
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,920
Hair will grown within a monthSo don't worry

375
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,380
Welcome, that's my eldest daughterThis is my 2nd daughter

376
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,170
Come to grandpa's lap

377
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,300
Only today

378
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,800
Then even in your dreamsyou can't sit on his lap!

379
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,750
This place is registered anddocumented in my name, okay?

380
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,000
I won't, get lost!

381
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,840
Here's a banana, open your mouth

382
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,550
Do you like it?

383
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,210
- Wow!- Wait, dear

384
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,500
Don't cry

385
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,050
Will your brother keepgifting away all the gold?

386
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,300
He's doing everythingas per our custom

387
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,960
Look at our daughterswalking away in a huff

388
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,340
Ask their grandmotherto bless them

389
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,340
She will be 100 years very soon, right?

390
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,800
Bro, come here

391
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,210
How many sovereignsdid you give your nieces?

392
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,590
May be around 18 sovereigns

393
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,880
For my daughter's ear-piercing functionfather gifted only 6 sovereigns!

394
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,000
To gift 18 sovereigns,was your daughter born in the city?

395
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,460
Am I right, bro-in-law?

396
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,170
If it's custom, you mustbe impartial to all

397
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,840
Why this pretension?

398
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,800
Started, huh?

399
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,500
The chap who does nothinggets away scot-free

400
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,000
We target the Good Samaritanon a vengeful spree!

401
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,050
Look at your daughter's neck

402
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,210
Look at your son's neck

403
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,090
Hey, brother, listen

404
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,590
Valuable income, huh?Thank you, uncle

405
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,460
Difference of opinion will ariseamong siblings, son-in-law

406
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,460
But when there's a function at home...

407
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,800
...if you come, he doesn'tand if he comes, you don't turn up

408
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,590
Once broken, it cannot be gluedPlease turn a blind eye

409
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,630
To unite Thamarai Manala Sendaiyar andMalligai Manala Sendaiyar is my duty

410
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,880
- Hey, come here- What, ma?

411
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,670
Why spend so much?

412
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,920
This isn't expenditureIt's called savings

413
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,920
Savings is not just accumulating money

414
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,800
Uniting relatives is also an asset

415
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,300
How can you sleepif you aren't generous?!

416
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,380
Stay the same way

417
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,800
- Don't change- Okay, pa

418
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,050
Come, let's all eat

419
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,630
- Please come- Uncle

420
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,920
- Chain is beautiful- Do you like it?

421
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,800
- Okay, go eat- Uncle?

422
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,840
Poompozhil Chellammais your own sister's daughter

423
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,670
I'm your half-sister's daughter

424
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,800
General talk is you'll marry only her

425
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,170
Is that true, uncle?

426
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,460
Forget themYou go eat

427
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,800
Don't talk beyond your ageGo and eat

428
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,090
Uncle

429
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,710
Don't listen to anyone

430
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,050
Listen to me

431
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,670
Don't marry either of your nieces

432
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,550
'It was a delicious feast'

433
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,800
It's a new feeling of pleasure to eatwhen your son is the breadwinner

434
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,210
Son, I gave you the responsibilityof taking care of the fields

435
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,590
You do a good job

436
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,460
Same way I've decided to entrustfamily responsibilities also

437
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,710
- Keep quiet, pa- I've been the head for 50 years

438
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,460
You'll take care of our familymuch better than me

439
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,750
I want to bring all ourfamily members together

440
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,170
Take a group photo

441
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,130
Hang it with pride on our wall

442
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,750
That's my dearest wish

443
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,840
Only then even when I die...

444
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,750
...people will say Ranasingam lived lifeto the fullest and passed away

445
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
- Grandpa!- How morbid can you get?

446
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,960
I'll hand overa tougher task

447
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,050
From both your mothers' eyes

448
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,460
From your 5 sisters' eyesnot a single tear should drop

449
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,880
So long as I don't shed tearslike a waterfall!

450
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,340
Stop...please stop

451
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,340
Wretched fellow!May you rot in hell

452
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,750
May you have 'loosies'and lose all your peace

453
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,210
My curse will chase you!

454
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,920
- What, grandma?- Waiting for 3 hours with this load

455
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,300
Only if I sell thisI can eat a square meal

456
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,590
'Bus drivers never allow this load'

457
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,550
As youngsters, won't you ask?

458
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,500
Give a hand to grandma

459
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,800
Ram and LakshmanCatch up with that bus

460
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,380
Run...run fast

461
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,920
Go...go

462
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,500
That's the way, good

463
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,710
Hey! Stop...stop...stop!

464
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,500
Why is the groom-to-beroaming in the hot sun?

465
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,800
- You might tan- As if I can get any darker!

466
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,840
What is the return giftfor the wedding?

467
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,710
Sweet lime and biscuit

468
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:44,050
Give coffee and they can soakthe biscuit and eat on the way home

469
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,590
Give a sapling, it will bring yougood-will and shade later

470
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,050
Who is blocking the bus?Move your cart

471
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,130
- They are chatting, right?- Stop...stop!

472
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,210
- Hey partner- Hey, Achukutti

473
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,170
- How was the 'Jallikattu'?- We rocked

474
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,380
How can you chat blocking the bus?

475
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,170
Won't you move asidewhen we honk?

476
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,380
You are blocking traffic tooDid we honk?

477
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,130
- If you don't move, I'll call the police- We'll call Duraisingam!

478
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,590
You drive like you're a pilot!

479
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,630
You get mad, if your work is disturbed, eh?

480
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,500
Doesn't the same hold good for us?

481
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,170
- Why didn't you take her sacks?- I'll be 8 passengers short

482
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,000
I get yelled at by my boss

483
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,170
What can I do?

484
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,130
Your owner doesn't need to eat?

485
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,090
- Where are you from?- Town

486
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,840
Then it's difficult

487
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,590
Do you know how much timeand sweat go into that sack of brinjals?

488
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,800
- How long are you in service?- 15 years

489
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,840
Try being a farmer for 1 day

490
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,210
Not even that

491
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,630
Try being WITH a farmer for 1 day

492
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,090
Then you'll realisethe difficulties of a farmer

493
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,460
'Then you wouldn't haveleft her stranded like this'

494
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,090
Hereafter such busesshouldn't have seats at the back

495
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,500
- Get the spanner- Ready, uncle

496
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,380
'Move aside'

497
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,130
'Grandma, get in'

498
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,090
'- May you lead a royal life- Talk less, work more!'

499
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,380
Stretch your legs andlie down comfortably

500
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:13,170
"O' my fair lady, princessYou robbed my heart I guess"

501
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,550
"O' my fair lady, my lovely"

502
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,130
Want the driver's seat removed?

503
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,840
- He has been sitting for a long time- Not that

504
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,300
He might ask grandmato alight in the middle

505
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,880
So let's get downalong with her

506
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,670
Is it until 'patti' alights oruntil this 'party' gets down?!

507
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,090
My guess was right

508
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,670
Nothing wrong, 100% right

509
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,460
'Our Audi car is parked thereYou turned on the air conditioner'

510
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:44,130
"Is your pupil a whip, my princess?It makes me salute you spontaneous?"

511
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:50,090
"O' my fair lady, princessYou robbed my heart I guess"

512
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,170
Bro...?

513
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,550
You gave me only Rs 1.50

514
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,800
- What about balance 50 paise?- No coins at all

515
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,170
Won't I return if I had?

516
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,840
"You became a thief blithely"

517
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,170
Where are you going?

518
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,630
Don't you know that?

519
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,130
'Where is she going?'

520
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,750
Don't forget the 50 paise

521
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,550
Haven't got as yet!Won't I give if I had?

522
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,460
"Like being dragged in a deluge helplessyou yanked me with your eyes merciless"

523
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,170
Looks like she's worsethan Uncle Scrooge!

524
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,130
Whoever marries herwill die in exasperation

525
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,300
Shouldn't malign girls

526
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,300
"My life that had fallen into a pitYou loftily lifted me out of it"

527
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,750
All beautiful girls will seemvery familiar to boys!

528
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,380
Sir, he's the head of the departmentin our Agricultural college

529
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,460
I've read many articles on your son, sir

530
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,590
If he gives a speech in our collegestudents will be motivated

531
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,590
Oh my God!I can't talk, sir

532
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,420
Why should you talk?

533
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,090
Share what you do everyday

534
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,340
When is this function?

535
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,590
March 27th

536
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,670
On March 27th don't we havesome important work, sir?

537
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,300
We are planting elephant yamon 27th, 28th and 29th

538
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,170
31st and 1st planting raw banana

539
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,420
He's free on 30th

540
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,960
Yes, she's right

541
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,670
Let's have it on March 30th

542
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,300
No issuesWe'll do it in style

543
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,500
Thank you, sir

544
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,670
The girl we saw in the bus

545
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:27,000
"Your glance is like the sun in MayIt scorches me to cinders all the way"

546
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:33,550
"When will you be as cool as December?To rest on my chest your head will favor"

547
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,800
"My betrothed belovedin your beauty I dissolved"

548
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,170
"Waiting for you to say 'yes'I follow you daily, my dear lass"

549
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,800
Isn't the music wonderful?

550
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,630
Is it only the music, uncle?

551
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,050
'Thank you, folk music troupe'

552
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,000
Great G-ma, come here

553
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:59,000
'Next is a video onour special guest Gunasingam'

554
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,630
'Farming isn't a businessIt's a way of life'

555
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,550
Farming is not just my wish

556
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,670
It's my avaricious wish

557
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,300
'Farming is more paying than IT'

558
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,130
'Change barren lands to green'

559
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,210
Let sowing seedsbe a daily need

560
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,800
'Use organic growth promotersPanchakavya and Navakavya'

561
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,630
Let farming be a daily bonus indeed

562
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,960
'Farmers should use natural fertilizersand herbal pesticides'

563
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,960
Stride like a plough with pride

564
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,710
Encourage farmers worldwide

565
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,170
My goal is...

566
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,500
...to bring back those who wentfrom the villages to the city

567
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,670
'This farmer's wish should come true'

568
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,500
We invite farmer Gunasingam on the daiswith affection to share his thoughts

569
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,880
'Don't forget to saya few words about me'

570
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,800
Thank you

571
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,880
'Vanakkam'

572
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,420
Did you all eat well?

573
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,880
'Shall I talk from there?'

574
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,340
This mud-soiled hand is holdinga mic for the 1st time

575
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,210
So I don't know how to start

576
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,800
The folk music and dance was splendid

577
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,840
'Grain and a grain of truth are the same'So our elders say

578
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,710
If you sow a good grainin a fertile piece of land

579
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,170
...it will grow a 100 times it seems

580
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,380
Similarly if I share a good wordwith students like you...

581
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
...I felt it will multiply a 100 times

582
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,170
That's why when I was invitedI agreed readily

583
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,340
Usually we ask our children if they wantto be an engineer, doctor or collector

584
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,420
Farming is not even given as an option

585
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,210
But when I was young, it seems my fatherasked me what I wanted to become

586
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,050
He included being a farmer too

587
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,300
I believe right then I chose farming

588
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,840
At this juncture I would like to thankmy father who gave me that option

589
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,090
He aced it, eh?!

590
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,670
I'll strangle you!

591
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,840
By repeatedly mentioningFarming is India's backbone

592
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,050
...they've hidden it behind our back!

593
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,960
Not realizing this,we carry on

594
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,170
If a handful realize and quittheir IT jobs and become farmers

595
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,210
...we label them ignorantlyas 'not knowing how to survive'

596
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,710
Some are so backward enough to thinktheir daughters should not marry a farmer

597
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,000
Okay now?

598
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,550
In foreign countries even the educatedare proud to be farmers

599
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,550
Only in India, the literate shouldnot soil their hands in our soil

600
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,800
Only the illiterate should be farmershas become their fate

601
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,460
I haven't come here topraise farming and farmers

602
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,130
Reason why I'm talking here is...

603
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,800
...in the name of getting ethane

604
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,380
...a gang has set out todestroy farming and farmers

605
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,840
Uncle, you're asking for an IT raid!

606
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,340
When you realise the rich man's diet andpoor man's hunger are 2 different issues

607
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,460
...only that day

608
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,460
...you'll know what a national crime it isto make the farmer eat Govt's 'ration' rice

609
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,880
You'll be branded a traitorand shoved behind bars

610
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,170
- We are here to support him- Keep quiet

611
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,170
Like our Nammalvar said

612
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,710
In the Green revolution we startedthere's no green or revolution

613
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,000
Only if people, Govt andscientists unite as one

614
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,460
...our country will prosper

615
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,500
Only when students think offarming and politics as professions

616
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,960
...India will be a Super power

617
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,840
For every agricultural productthere should be a Govt market

618
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,090
Only then suicide rate offarmers will reduce

619
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,710
A farmer's death today...

620
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,710
...will be the death of millions tomorrow

621
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,300
Why should we farmers die?

622
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,340
When shameless people livewhy should we die?

623
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,960
One who creates alone isn't God

624
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,800
One who sows seeds is also God

625
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,590
As farmers we should stridelifting our collars with pride

626
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,670
Well said!

627
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,210
Dear students

628
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,090
You take up engineering,medicine or law

629
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,800
Why, even politics is fine

630
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,880
In addition take up agriculture also

631
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,460
According to me...

632
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,550
...instead of counting the medalsin the next Olympics

633
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,750
...how many will be farmersfrom the next generation is important

634
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,800
That is the need of the hourfor every house and our nation as a whole

635
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,630
I'm not saying thisto hear your applause

636
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,050
We should not be stuckwith a begging bowl, alas!

637
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,630
Best wishes to all the future farmers

638
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,090
Thank you for giving me this opportunity

639
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,500
Sir, that was a heartwarming speech

640
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,880
He's your student, sir

641
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,710
'You spoke so soulfullyI feel like giving you 1000 gold coins'

642
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,380
Sir, you were brilliant!

643
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,750
I don't want any gold coin

644
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,880
I'll be happy if you find outwhich bus that '50 paise' boards

645
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,460
That's no big deal

646
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,960
Grandpa, hot soup for you

647
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:47,420
Uncle, chicken gravy, fish gravycrab, steamed prawn

648
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,590
What shall I cook?

649
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,090
Make a potpourri!

650
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,800
Do whatever but I can taste the souponly if you let go of my hand

651
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
If both my handsare massaged by you-

652
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,880
- Massage my knee- I need to take 2 days off

653
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,210
Of course, sir

654
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,460
Why are you out of sorts?

655
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
My grandson is missingfor the past 10 days

656
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,630
I thought he will find his way back

657
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,500
He went for the race that day

658
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,050
He's in love with some girl I heard

659
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,170
Kodiyarasu's men have warned him

660
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,800
...not to fall in love with a girloutside his own caste

661
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,210
After that he never got back home

662
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,630
Don't think the worst, sir

663
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,380
He'll come backJust enquire

664
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,170
- Why don't you also enquire?- Okay, father

665
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,620
You gave only Rs 7.50The ticket is Rs 8

666
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,290
You owe me 50 paise earlier

667
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,540
Now we are quits

668
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,910
Don't tell anyone hereafteryou don't have small change to give

669
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,790
Move aside

670
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,540
'Go, egg-head!'

671
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,330
'Will he play this same trick again?'

672
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,540
Govt should've eliminated 50 paisa coinswith 500 and 1000 notes

673
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,370
Economy plays a pivotal role

674
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,870
Sooper!You aced it

675
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,540
You are soooper tooYou spoke so well

676
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,290
Both of you have the gift of the gab!

677
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,000
When everyone ridiculed meonly you applauded!

678
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,500
Thank you very much

679
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,410
I feel I've seen you somewhere

680
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,540
- College- No

681
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,790
Before that

682
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,620
- In the bus- No, even before that

683
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,950
Before and after?!

684
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,500
'If hassled or in happinessJolly soda goes down with a fizz'

685
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,910
'If hassled or in happinessJolly soda goes down with a fizz'

686
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,500
When I saw this posterI thought what a hep girl

687
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,200
- Assumed she must be in Chennai- Why?

688
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,160
Only girls in Chennai are hep, huh?

689
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,540
Modelling is mostly in Chennai, right?

690
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,540
Hello! I am not a model

691
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,330
Are you an actress?

692
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,370
I am an owner

693
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,370
- Own what?- Jolly soda company

694
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,620
You are the owner

695
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,580
- How can you act?- Why not?

696
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,000
Don't owners of Vasanth & Co,Saravana Stores...

697
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,290
...Lalitha Jewellers act intheir own commercials?

698
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,500
- That's the current fashion- You bet!

699
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,660
Only TV viewers knowwhat an eye sore it is

700
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,040
- Shut up- Have you tasted our soda?

701
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,000
- Isn't it simply too good?- Sooper

702
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,950
Doesn't go well with mixing liquor

703
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,410
Boys crib because they feel like puking

704
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,620
If you add a little essence

705
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,080
...it will enhance the flavor

706
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,290
'She should take it in good spirit!'

707
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,540
'We should haveour fan club in every street'

708
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,540
We have so many carslying idle at home, dear

709
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,910
Why strain yourselfin a bus or 'share' auto?

710
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,660
I love travelling in a bus, uncle

711
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,750
This is Iniyal's father's hard earned money

712
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,000
The day Thillainayagam's daughter earns...

713
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,410
...that will be the day

714
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
That's my signature, uncle

715
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,700
She refuses to even ride pillionwith me on my bike, bro

716
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,000
It is very tough to impress girls

717
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,040
On top of it she is our sister's daughter

718
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,330
She won't fall for anyoneYou'll marry her

719
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,250
'Ma, if you had reminded meI would've brought the red banana clusters'

720
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,330
I wanted to tell youSomehow it skipped my mind

721
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,660
Just like you!

722
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,000
Hey! What is this new habit?

723
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:31,660
Uncle, even though I'm your nieceyou must formally 'see' me as your bride

724
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,660
You know that ritual of wearinga fancy silk sari and serving coffee

725
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,750
I want you to 'see' me like that

726
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,580
- I love all that formality- You silly idiot!

727
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,830
You've seen your motherLet's go home

728
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,660
Look at this

729
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,200
- Who is he?- 'Who sends you such memes?'

730
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,000
She is from our communityGunasingam's niece

731
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,000
He is from a different caste

732
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,700
- Saw this one?- 'Enough...enough'

733
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,120
Is this how you behave in public?

734
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,370
Which village are you from?

735
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,830
Who are you to ask?

736
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
How dare you!

737
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,750
Try enquiring aroundThen you will know

738
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,250
- Give me your father's phone #- Why?

739
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,540
My phone

740
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,160
Tell me

741
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,700
I am Kodiyarasu speaking

742
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,950
Our clan

743
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,540
Your daughter is flirting withsome chap in the bus stop

744
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,830
He is my friend

745
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,910
Put her in place

746
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,540
Our girls won't step out of line

747
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,410
My wife's brother will keepan eye on my daughter

748
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,660
'Hang up now'

749
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,370
If I catch you bothhanging out together-

750
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,700
If you do?

751
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,830
- Chellamma- Hello, uncle

752
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,000
What are you doing?

753
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,330
They are hitting mein front of my college

754
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,580
Give back my phone

755
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,330
Do 300 sit-upslike our brother ordered

756
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,330
Come onI'm waiting

757
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,200
'You want to fall for a girlfrom our caste!'

758
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,700
Don't stop

759
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,410
Even if it takes you 3 dayswe won't let you go

760
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,120
'Will your father do the rest?'

761
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,830
'Why are you out of breath?Go on...do it'

762
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,620
He's my friend, uncleWe were just chatting

763
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,660
They made nasty remarksThey even grabbed my phone

764
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,500
Ask him what his problem isHe's the one, uncle

765
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,410
Bash him up, uncle

766
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,660
'He's trying to escape'

767
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,000
'Don't hit me'

768
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,200
'Beat him to a pulp'

769
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,410
'Come into the frame'

770
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,750
'Let me goIt hurts!'

771
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,870
'If you mess with his fiancee'

772
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,500
'...think you can go scot-free?'

773
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,540
'Let me go'

774
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,830
Call your 'Culture King'and ask him to come here

775
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,500
- I like that, uncle- Listen

776
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,500
If a girl and boy enjoy a jokedoes it mean they are in love?

777
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,870
Why are you so concernedwith my niece?

778
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,500
You want to collect votesbased on caste?

779
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:54,200
We send our girls to collegetrusting the boys in their class

780
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,620
They keep a good watch

781
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,700
If you try acting funny with me-

782
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,580
Using caste as an excuse to runa political party or trade favors

783
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,000
Hypocrites claiming todecry caste but fan the flames

784
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,580
You should all be burnt alive

785
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,120
Get lost!Scram

786
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,370
Super, uncle

787
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,620
A literate is a breed apart!

788
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,410
I am an illiterate

789
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,080
An illiterate is in a class of his own!

790
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,250
Clear out!

791
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,580
- Go home, dear- Thanks, uncle

792
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,540
We are gaining the confidenceof our caste only now

793
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,080
As defender of our clan

794
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,660
If anyone hinders the progress...

795
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,870
...we need 4 jeeps with strong tyres,10 kg sugar and 5 liters of fuel

796
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,660
Get lost!

797
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,080
My dear uncle

798
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,120
I got all the detailsabout your 'soda bottle'

799
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,750
Her name is Kannukiniyal

800
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,700
'Sight for sore eyes'What a beautiful Tamil name!

801
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:46,000
Does my name 'Sivagamiyin Selvan'sound Chinese to you?

802
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,500
Only daughter

803
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,080
Her family is loaded

804
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,540
She can easily travel by car

805
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,830
That affluent but she preferstaking the bus

806
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,540
Because she loves simplicity

807
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,660
That's exactly why I love her

808
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,580
What are you amused about?

809
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,410
One look at her face, I guessedher refined upbringing and affluence

810
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,660
Give me a high five for that

811
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,410
You are 'Goggle' uncle

812
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,790
- Google-google- Oh! Like that, huh?

813
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,410
So she's an only child

814
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,910
All I have to do is visitmy father-in-law's place to rest up

815
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,830
You look like a man who feastedon a succulent lamb

816
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,620
Father

817
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,410
Have you ever fallen in love?

818
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:27,120
What kind of question is that?!

819
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,120
Why get me into trouble?

820
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:38,000
Don't get down, it will be a denton your dignity if you stand here

821
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,080
As if you brought mein a chariot previously!

822
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,620
- How much is 1 cubit of jasmine?- Rs 30

823
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,080
Aiyo! Daylight robbery!

824
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,000
Take a look at that girl

825
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,910
Give me 2 cubits for Rs 15

826
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,540
Why are you so tight fisted?

827
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,950
- I'm doing it properly- Be generous while measuring

828
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,290
Look how cleverly she is bargaining

829
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,620
Have you fallen in love, son?

830
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,500
Is this the important matteryou wanted to discuss with me?

831
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,000
I wanted to fall in loveafter you give the green signal

832
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,620
Is that a complimenting lookor an insulting glance?

833
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,000
Do you wish to fall in loveor get married to her?

834
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,910
Nowadays no one marriesthe girl he falls for

835
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,040
Nor does he lovethe girl he marries!

836
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,830
I'll fall in love andthen marry her

837
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:21,120
What about your sisters' daughters?

838
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,120
I can even say 'no' to this girl

839
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,290
But I cannot marry any of my nieces, pa

840
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:28,540
If I marry Andal, Chellamma willbe miffed and vice versa

841
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,870
I can't even think ofsuch a predicament

842
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,200
'Don't think you madea steal of a bargain'

843
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,290
'My 1st sale, so I relented'

844
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,250
Alright, sonYour happiness is mine too

845
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,660
When our family gets to know of this

846
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,080
Not just your sisters

847
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,750
Both my wives willdance on my head too

848
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:49,160
You must not get me into a messclaiming I gave you prior permission

849
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,410
I know what that covert glance means

850
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,000
Don't snitch on meLet's go home now

851
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,080
Get this into your head

852
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,410
You should handle the ladies, right fromyour great-grandma to your youngest niece

853
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,700
Son, ensure our family doesn't fall apart

854
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,120
Okay, pa

855
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,160
How are you, Kennedysami?

856
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,370
Kodiyarasu, can youcome up to the station?

857
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:24,410
It's an auspicious dayI must preside over 5 weddings

858
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,370
- What is the issue?- You killed Uday Shankar 15 days ago

859
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,120
'A complaint has been filed'

860
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,200
Who?

861
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,540
Gunasingam, sir

862
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,950
If you come, this can besolved in just 10 minutes

863
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,330
Who did the rounds last night?

864
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,540
Why did you lose the walkie-talkie?

865
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,870
Inspector, Gunasingam islying through his teeth

866
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,660
We don't see eye to eye

867
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,870
If so, why did youcome here flustered?

868
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,750
Why should I be scared?I'm innocent, so I came

869
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,290
Kennedysami

870
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,660
Take him asideand do the needful!

871
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,790
- Hello?- The bride is here, bro

872
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,700
- Will bro come in time?- He'll be there in 10 minutes

873
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,700
Kodiyarasu, Gunasingam haskidnapped your man

874
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,540
'In the race last month'

875
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,410
'...our math teacher's sonwas talking to his girlfriend'

876
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,910
'She is from our community'

877
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:18,750
Hey! Who the hell are you?

878
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,040
Don't you try manhandling me!

879
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,660
Keep your caste mania to yourself

880
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,120
I will marry only herWhat can you do?

881
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,370
'That boy died because ofthe sharp blow on his head'

882
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,000
Why did you do this, bro?

883
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,950
One has to sacrifice to engagein politics and become a leader

884
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,330
Like this chap

885
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:41,080
'To conceal this heinous actthey cremated his body'

886
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,790
'Mixed his ashes in the river'

887
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:55,290
They didn't even let me see my son's ashes

888
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,700
Don't look at Kodiyarasu's clout, sir

889
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,660
Our math teacher is the most affected

890
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,910
You signed my warrant when I wason my way to preside over a wedding

891
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,000

892

How much can you spare?

894
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,700

895
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,870
2 million

896
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,410
2.5 million

897
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,250
I'll try to persuade my boss

898
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,660
Go and tell him

899
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,080
No way

900
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,540
The story will get knottedYou do the honors

901
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,290
Inspector, I lost my cool andknocked him, he died on the spot

902
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,120
You haven't filed a report?

903
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,410
So are you confessing to the murder?

904
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,290
Kennedysami

905
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,370

911
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,700
'You won't prosperNot one bit!'

912
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,330
They arrested our brotherin the blink of an eye

913
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,660
I made a mistake trusting himbecause he's my wife's brother

914
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,120
I feel shivers down my spineright up to my intestines

915
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,040
If my company facesany problems because of him-

916
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,000
Don't over react, uncle

917
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,370
Get lost!

918
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,080
Uncle, here comes your girlfriend

00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,830
Where are you off to?

920
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,620
- Temple- But we haven't bathed

921
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,160
Oh gawd!Spare me, uncle

922
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,700
My dear nephewWhere are you?

923
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,870
Where did you disappear?

924
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,160
I went to dunk myselfin a cup of hot tea!

925
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,700
One track uncle of mine!

926
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:07,290

927
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:08,540
Sit and bathe leisurely

928
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,950
Is it okay if they bathe youas a corpse tomorrow?

929
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,410
Lord Shiva, bless me

930
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,910
He has come withsacred ash smeared all over...

931
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,580
...as if it's a Fancy dress competition!

932
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,870
[clears throat]

933
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,080
'Praise be to Lord Vishnuwho is covered with a pearl like hue'

934
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,660
This is Lord Shiva's son, Muruga

935
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,500
- Sorry, Muruga- Uncle, listen

936
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,620
How could you confuse the sweetoffered to Vishnu and Shiva?

937
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,540
'They will make mincemeat out of us today'

938

I come daily

941
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,700
Do I have to take this cold dip daily?

942
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:53,500
My Lord, defendant Kodiyarasuhas been a Good Samaritan in our society

943
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:57,620
You mean social serviceor is the service limited to his caste?

944
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,660
He is a well known entrepreneur

945
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,910
We can surrender his passport to this court

946
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:05,250
Please show mercy andgrant him bail, Your Honor

He has killed a student

949
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,540
This can lead to a riot

950
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:19,370
He has to go to the police stationin Mattuthavani, 200 km from Madurai

00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,950

01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,160
Don't you like my smile?

1057
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,580
Will you laugh even for this?

1058
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,910
Of course

1059
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,000
That's why I love you sooo much

1060
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,200
Alright

1061
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,330
'Aim for his neck!'

1062
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:00,620
Uncle!

1063
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,750
Watch out!

1064
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,000
School boys

1065
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,870
- Boys, move- Oh gawd!

1066
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,580
You should be alert hereafter, son

1067
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,120
I am fine, pa

1068
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,410
Akka, I sprained my right leg

1069
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:35,160
Why are you massaging my left foot?

1070
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,250
Keep quiet, if that leg is sprainedthis leg will go numb

1071
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,620
Your brother is fine

1072
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,330
Come onAttend to your work

1073
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:51,160
Safari, the car is blocking the wayDon't you have to park it to the side?

1074
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,580
I forgot, bro

1075
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,870
Taste my country chicken soup

1076
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:56,200
No need, akka

1077
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,830
My precious bro, I knowyou like lamb trotters soup

1078
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:00,790
I brought it specially for you

1079
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:03,250
What about elephant foot soup?

1080
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:07,910
My arm is in a bandageand he gets an oil massage

1081
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,660
Their concern is more unbearablethan this nasty wound

1082
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,750
Ignore himYou taste my soup

1083
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,870
Babyamma, what are you doing?

1084
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,450
I am fanning, my dear

1085
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,870
It's freezing cold!Go slow on the fanning

1086
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,080
- My dear nephew- Uncle?

1087
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,250
Is it that painful?

1088
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:25,620
No, it's so comforting

1089
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,790
Drink your soupto your stomach's content!

1090
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:29,870
- What?- Why are you upset now?

1091
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,750
Your uncle is fine

1092
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,700
He won't give up that easily

1093
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,870
He'll come and I'll comply!

1094
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:39,910
Yes, you are our local Godfather!

1095
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:43,750
Your razor sharp tonguewill beat his sickle hollow

1096
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,700
- Drink it up, bro- That's all

1097
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,160
Queen # 01

1098
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:49,330
Father...?

1099
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:50,910
Carry on

1100
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:55,040
A wife is the one who spoilsthe husband by pampering

1101
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,830
Grandpa, don't you haveany intoxicant as weakness?

1102
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:02,660
Intoxicants differ from person to person

1103
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,370
I am intoxicated by my family

1104
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:07,160
That's a givenUncle has no intoxicant, right?

1105
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,750
- What's happening?- I was just curious

1106
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,160
Let's eat dinner outsideenjoying the fresh breeze

1107
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,660
Praise be to the lords of South and North!

1108
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,450
Liquor licked to the last drop

1109
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,080
Waitees!I'm also coming

1110
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,000
I want to sit next to my uncle

1111
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,870
Don't dig into my ribsYou can sit comfortably there

1112
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,790
Don't forget to paymy college fees tomorrow

1113
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:40,330
That's for studious students

1114
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:43,250
- Not Facebook addicts- Shut up!

1115
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:45,250
I want to be in the photo too

1116
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,080
Look here

1117
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,250
Family deity!Don't possess her

1118
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,870
Goddess, be appeased

1119
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,080
Important call

1120
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,790
- Sit down, sweety- Eat first

1121
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:02,290
Officer is calling me regardingthe banana cultivation

1122
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,410
How are you feeling now, dear?

1123
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,290
I am fineJust a sprain

1124
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:12,080
I want to see you at once

1125
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,750
- Will you come now?- Impossible

1126
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:17,000
My sisters and brothers-in-law are here

1127
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:20,450
The entire brood came runningto nurse the pampered cub, huh?

1128
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,290
Look at their tender loving careAs if they are like you!

1129
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:26,000
Why don't you tellthe 'tender loving care' brood

1130
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,790
...you love this girl Iniya?

1131
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:37,000
Aiyaiyo! I dread to thinkof all their reactions

1132
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,540
- You have no other choice- Why?

1133
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,580
My uncle has toldmy father about us

1134
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:43,830
Oh gawd!Then...?

1135
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:45,870
My father hasn't asked meanything till now

1136
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:47,580
It's better we tell your parents

1137
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,910
That's only protocol

1138
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,120
You are thinking thriceto accept a farmer as son-in-law

1139
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:11,000
Soon people will start feeling jealousof a farmer groom than an NRI groom

1140
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:16,870
Rather than an educated groomsettled abroad earning 1 lakh a month...

1141
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:20,870
...I prefer and respect a local groomwho earns only 10,000 per month

1142
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:24,250
The hesitation is notbecause you're a farmer

1143
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:27,830
Have you informed your father?

1144
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,290
I fell in love with your daughteronly after my father saw her

1145
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,750
Does he know she isThillainayagam's daughter?

1146
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,620
What is this new hitch?

1147
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:43,620
We have no objection

1148
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:47,200
- You are part of a big joint family- Let me serve, ma

1149
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,700
Let him consult everyone andmeet me if he favors this alliance

1150
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,000
You should take the cup

1151
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:58,080
'You should offer me a cup'

1152
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,700
'So I can relish the coffee too'

1153
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:04,660
I'll take leave then, sir

1154
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,330
See you

1155
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:13,160
My dear boy, will you come backor follow your father's footsteps?

1156
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:14,750
I don't understand

1157
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:20,250
'If a daughter is bornI'll come here for sure'

1158
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,750
Your father was supposedto marry my sister you know

1159
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:27,250
He never came back

1160
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,080
Only if the baby is a girl

1161
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,290
He got a boy insteadand sent him here

1162
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:33,370
I'll be back

1163
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:35,160
Definitely, uncle

1164
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,540
You've made up your mindto show your muscle power

1165
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,830
The nearest village is10 km away on that side

1166
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,290
On this side7 km away

1167
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:57,700
If you are bashed up in no man's landwho will pick your broken limbs?

1168
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:00,290
Don't worry, we are hereto butcher you to bits

1169
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:02,620
There are plenty ofwild dogs and foxes here

1170
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:04,540
You'll make a good feast for them

1171
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:07,120
That's why we chosethis isolated spot

1172
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:10,910
If I bash you up, will those dogsand foxes die devouring you?

1173
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,330
Poor creatures!

1174
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,200
Wait, I have a plan

1175
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,700
Uncle, if we get trappedthey will have the time of their life

1176
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,750
Why are you so scared?You are strong like Superman

1177
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:23,700
I scurry and scootlike a bandicoot

1178
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:26,410
The smallest soundand I'll run for my life

1179
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:29,080
One who shows his strengthisn't Superman nowadays

1180
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,870
One who does NOT exhibithis weakness is the strongest

1181
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:34,450
Then I am Superman, huh?

1182
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:37,080
Is the job done?

1183
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,330
Be on the line

1184
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:40,910
Get your bail as you hear himscream in pain and agony

1185
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,080
Just break his limbs into two

1186
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,830
- I'll handle the rest of him- Okay, bro

1187
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,500
Is it Team hospital?

1188
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,790
There has been a major accidentnear Koonimoottu forest area

1189
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,700
Around 15 men are lyingdiced to minuuute pieces

1190
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,700
Make it fast, sir

1191
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:08,250
One of them in a yellow shirtis bleeding from his ear, sir

1192
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,410
The chap in a black shirt

1193
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,370
His hand is broken

1194
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,540
Left hand is fractured

1195
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,540
And he's writhing in pain

1196
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,200
One ambulance won't be enough

1197
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:32,500
The whole gang is likea herd of wild buffaloes

1198
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,290
If you bring 3 ambulances...

1199
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:36,830
...all the broken limbscan be picked up with ease

1200
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:38,870
Coming?Leave right away

1201
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,160
Why invite trouble?

1202
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:46,040
If you want to call it quits reallyyou should trouble trouble to the T

1203
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,410
I'll show my muscle power

1204
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,910
You follow suit

1205
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,660
Bash him upand finish him off

1206
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:05,500
Uncle, yellow shirt

1207
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,080
His ears should splitBoth left and right

1208
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,870
- Which hand did you say?- Left...left

1209
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:11,290
You must ensureyou snuff his breath

1210
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,750
- What happened?- Are you still there?

1211
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,450
Where is the culprit?

1212
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,290
Have you been granted bail or not?

1213
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:26,450
Pray I don't come out on bail

1214
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,290
I'll pray bail is granted to you

1215
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,750
If I come out-

1216
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,660
If you consider yourself a manmeet me face to face

1217
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,660
Hey! Great escape, huh?

1218
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,540
If you intend stopping my wedding

1219
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,450
Whoever does,this will be your fate

1220
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,000
What if he is related to us?

1221
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,790
Let him beSo what?

1222
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:54,620
'With 2 nieces as bride-to-bewill you choose an outsider?'

1223
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,500
Look, you've stirred upa hornet's nest now

1224
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,500
What do you want me to do?

1225
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,870
I can't plead with your sisters

1226
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,540
But even if 1 family memberdoesn't agree, I won't consent

1227
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:13,120
If they don't, you must marrythe niece of our choice then

1228
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,580
Do you agree?

1229
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:21,410
My responsibility tobring everyone together

1230
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,700
You keep saying, 'we shouldhave a family group photo'

1231
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:27,120
I'll make your wish come true, pa

1232
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:32,290
Uncle, thunder and lightningstrike inside and outside

1233
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,540
Like a group photo in a school play

1234
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:37,750
You casually saidyou'll make his dream come true

1235
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,330
1st marry your girlthrough registration

1236
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:42,500
And start making babies

1237
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:45,500
Then if you persuade them'all is well that ends well'

1238
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,040
You'll need minimum 3 years

1239
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:51,120
Take a bowl and bed sheet andgo door to door convincing them

1240
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,160
- Why are you scaring me?- I'm not scaring you, uncle

1241
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,700
I am being practical

1242
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,200
It isn't a case ofyour mother or mine

1243
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,870
The hitch is your sister Mangamma

1244
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:02,700
I mean the 'coercive conspirator'

1245
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:07,500
If she makes up her mindto be manipulative...

1246
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,500
...even her husbandwill fall at her feet

1247
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,200
Hey! Drunk-skunk Thamarai

Cry baby

1255
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,750
Her weapon is tears

1256
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:31,200
She will jugglethe whole world with it

1257
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:34,750
Do you have an iota of shame,shyness, dignity, pride or prestige?

1258
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,450
To think I married you

1259
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,580
My father named me Samyuktha Ranifor me to live like a queen

1260
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:43,700
4th is the virago, Jhansi Rani

No, spying squad!

She is the admin for everyone

1263
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:52,000
If everyone says something is goodshe will negate it at once

1264
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:55,040
When everyone hates somethingshe will praise it sky high

1265
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,120
- Will you listen to me or not?- Of course we will

1266
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:00,910
You mustn't change your mindFollow me then

1267
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,120

She is aliveonly for her daughter

1270
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,870
If something happens to her daughter

1271
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:13,500
...we don't knowwhat drastic end she will choose

1272
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,000
If they are so complicatedimagine their husbands

1273
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,120
Icing on the cake isKannukiniyal's uncle

1274
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,120
Since there is no objectionfrom the public prosecutor

1275
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,620
...this court grants you bailrelaxing the conditional clause

1276
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:32,290
If we are scared of all thiswe'll become ordinary people

1277
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:33,620
We can tackle it

1278
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,580
Why is 'spy-squad' calling me?

1279
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,790
I believe you're marryingsome girl called Kannukiniyal

- If I'm in Trichy, think I won't know- No, akka

1282
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,620
Let me see who steps inwithout my approval!

1283
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:55,870
She is faster than 4G and 5G!

1284
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:57,370
In a nutshell

1285
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,750
I have to juggle and appeaseRamayana + Mahabharatha!

1286
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:15,580

Is he returning from'Satyagraha' protest? Go inside

1293
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,410
Aren't you all ashamed?

1294
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:43,620
Clear out now

1295
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:46,870
Sir, how can you be so rudewhen he's defending our clan?

1296
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,250
How dare you question him?

1297
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:52,080
He's my brother-in-lawHe has every right to reprimand me

1298
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,370
Get out of here

1299
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,290
I want him also to get out

1300
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:56,750
Ask him to clear out

1301
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:58,790
I don't want to see him ever again

1302
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:09,750
- What the hell?- We'll call the police

1303
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,500
Don't manhandle usWhy are you spoiling for a fight?

1304
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:16,330
How are you, Sivagami?

1305
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:17,750
This is a new number?

1306
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:20,160
Who is this?

1307
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,700

1308
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:23,790

I'll be there

1312
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,040
Which sister?

1313
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,120
I don't know!

1314
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,950
When I asked 'who'she bit my head off

1315
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:38,830
If I ask 'which akka', that's it

1316
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,830
If it was your mothershe would have called you

1317
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,410
Will it be the 2nd one or 3rd one?

1318
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:47,080
Shall I touch 1 finger?

1319
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,620
- Must be the 2nd one- Bang on!

1320

Only my uncle is likely to bebashed up by the villagers

01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:55,790
Look at the people of my village

1322
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:57,950
Violence should be their middle name!

1323
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,410
I never get involvedLet them go to an early grave

1324
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,790

Some misunderstandingbetween relatives

1334
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:27,500
- Your brother-in-law is the mediator- Then which akka called me?

1335
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:30,870

Try to show your power now!Thought he had no one for help?

1348
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,540
The lion cub of our family is here

How dare you hit my father!

1353
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,750

01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:35,910
...I'll pickle you to pieces

1355
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,080
- What happened?- Kodiyarasu is out on bail

1356
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,620
He wants to replacemy banner with his face!

1357
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:44,410
Why did you call from a strange number?

1358
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:46,250
My phone needs to be topped up

1359
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:48,660
I borrowed a phonefrom one of these goons

1360
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:50,040
Come in, bro

1361
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,950

And this came in between

1363
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,040
Getting married, huh?

1364
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,250
Did your spy squad tell you?

1365
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:58,580
I thought as much

1366
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:00,830
No one informed me

1367
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:03,950
If you say 'good news'it has to be your wedding

1368

01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:45,450
Are you out of your mind?

1407
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,120
That won't happen

1408
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,500
You can rest assured it won't

1409
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,700
'Onions and shallots'

1410
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,540
Hey junk of a jerk!Just shut up

1411
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,750
I took care of my brother as a baby

1412
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:00,330
He fought over our propertyand dragged me to court greedily

1413
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:03,040
Where?To court

1414
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:08,870
God didn't bless him with a childbecause of his bad intentions

1415
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,950
- Good-for-nothing fellow!- What is this?

1416
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:13,160
How long will this feud continue?

1417
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,410
A brother is your pillar of supporteven if you have 1000 friends

1418
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:19,500
As long as I am alivewe won't reunite

1419
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:22,160
We won't need our kith and kinas long as we are able and fit

1420
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,040
Only when we are lying incapacitatedwe will yearn for our own blood

1421
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:28,620
Money will come and go

1422
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:32,250
In the end all that was requiredwas a cartload of sand for burial

1423
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:33,830
He grew up withyour love and care

1424
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:37,410
He'll come running if you call himI'll go and bring him here

1425
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:39,830
I won't invite himfor my son's wedding

1426
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:41,540
I won't even call you!

1427
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,200
I won't even get you married!

1428
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:47,160
You're sitting here as ifyou have swallowed a crowbar

1429
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,160
You continue to be like this

1430
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,500
Uncle, she is possessed now!

1431
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,330
Save me from this possessed creature!

1432
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:03,080
Why are you deserting me?

1433
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:11,040
Bro, by now you should be sittingin the Parliament as a politician

1434
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,950
Gunasingam has made you sit in a go-down

1435
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,370
We should not spare him, bro

1436
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:17,580
Long live, bro KodiyarasuDefender of our clan

1437
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:20,370
- How are you, Shanmugam?- I am good, bro

1438
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,250
I cancelled my weddingOnly when you preside I'll get married

1439
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:26,870
From mid May to mid Juneif you fix 1 auspicious day

1440
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,500
...I'll print the invitation

1441
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:31,700
Please go and eat

1442
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,660
I understand your affection

1443
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:40,620
But I'm not availablefor the next 6 months

1444
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:43,040
I was told you've been granted free bail

1445
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,200
The bail was for what I already did

1446
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:48,750
I said I will be in jail againfor what I am about to do

1447
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,620
Don't feel badFix a date in mid-May

1448
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:55,370
I'll get marriedafter you come out, bro

1449
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:58,000
I want only you to presideover my wedding

1450
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,750
I'll rip Gunasingam to piece-

1451
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,250
Who are his sisters?

1452
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:10,080
Welcome both of youI knew you were coming

1453
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,410
That's why I made chicken gravy for you

1454
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:16,370
Your love is a magnetic force

1455
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:18,250
The aroma makes me drool!

1456
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,790
Don't we have taste buds?

1457
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:23,950
- Don't get me wrong- Tell me, uncle

1458
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,040
I don't feel the same wayabout your mother

1459
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,870
Velunachiyar is a breed apart!

1460
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:29,620
Nothing wrong, 102% right

1461
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:33,580
- Hey husband! Come and eat- We are ready for the feast

1462
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:36,540
Akka, shall I sharea piece of good news?

01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:38,290

1464
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:39,750
Tell me

1465
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:42,660
You are giving us chicken to eat

1466
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,290
- I'll give you a wedding feast- Tell her first

1467
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:46,620
My precious cub!

1468
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,950
You get marriedGive me your baby

1469
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,290
I'll bring him up

1470
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:51,870
Will you baby sit by the dozen?

1471
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:54,750
Sure, I'll wipe their pee and crap happily

1472
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:57,830
I'm eating and you talk crap!

1473
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,660
Who is the bride?

1474
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,580
Kannukiniyal

1475
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,540
Then what about Chellamma?

1476
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,200
All of us thoughtyou'll marry only Chellamma

1477
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:10,700
Fell in love, huh?

1478
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:14,040
Nothing wrong, 103% rightBless him happily

1479
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,700
Welcome, my dear brother-in-law

1480
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,750
- How are you?- Carrying on

1481
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:20,330
I heard you're getting married

1482
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:24,290
I presume you went tomy elder brother's house

1483
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,200
I knew you would go there first

1484
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:31,250
He must have told youI shouldn't attend the wedding

1485
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,290
Taste the chicken

1486
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:36,950
And said he took care of me as a babypatting his shoulder proudly

1487
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:40,580
- Taste my chicken gravy- He would've said I am childless

1488
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:44,330
He must have asked for5 sovereign gold chain

1489
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:46,580
We are not so greedy

1490
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,750
3 sovereign gold chain will do

1491
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:54,000
And he should not attendthe wedding, that's all

1492
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,750
If you ask meboth the brothers shouldn't attend

1493
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:00,000
- What 'huh'?- Hiccup?

1494
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:03,120
2 brothers fighting for propertydoesn't seem right

1495
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,700
Even then both of you should reconcile

1496
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:06,910
Fat hopes!

1497
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:08,700
Why do you hate him so much?

1498
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,620
Not hatredIt's anger

1499
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,620
- So won't we be angry?- Eat, dear

1500
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,910
Show off your culinary skillsto your husband

1501
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:17,330
I came to invite youand you make a big fuss

1502
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,700
Ask him to attendthe wedding, then I'll eat

1503
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:22,160
If my uncle doesn't wantto eat, neither do I

1504
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Chicken is not even cookedI am boiling mad!

1505
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,580
If they behave like this...

1506
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,200
...imagine the sisterswith daughters as bride to-be

1507
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:40,620
The neighbor uncle

1508
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,620
How are you, akka?

1509
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:44,790
We are survivingWhat do we lack?

1510
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:46,620
I'm sure you're fine

1511
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,120
Where is your husband?

1512
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:51,870
He must have wanderedto earn a living somewhere

1513
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:56,910
If you keep crying like thismy slipper will speak!

1514
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,250
I need to tell you something

1515
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:01,370
I heard about it

1516
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:02,870
Be happy

1517
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,700
She's also a good girl

1518
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:06,620
You'll like herif you meet her

1519
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,500
All of you should come and bless us

1520
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,080
How can I come?

1521
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,790
In case you plan togobble some insecticide

1522
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:15,370
...do so with the doors openYou may end up stinking!

1523
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:17,910
Why are you instigating her?

1524
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,830
You are the troublemaker

1525
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:22,450
Don't add insult to injuryI feel like puking

1526
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:24,080
That man died on a Saturday

1527
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:27,200
Saturday corpse on the bierwill take a companion for sure!

1528
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:29,500
Wait, dear

1529
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:32,950
Please open the door

1530

...she has followed youlike a faithful shadow all the time

1532
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,330
Good lord!

1533
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:44,950

1534
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,540

Open the door

1536
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,700

1541
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:02,120
You don't have to pay my fees

1542
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:04,450
I don't want to study anymore

1543

1544

Go away from here

1546

Now cry baby’s turn!

1547

So many die in this village

1548
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:22,620
Why can't I die instead?

1549
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:25,120
Why was I married into this house?

1550
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,830

His bike isn't here

01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:10,540
Uncle is calling, huh?

01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:12,580

Shall I also come with you?

01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:30,120
That's exactly why I'm goingthrough all these hassles now

1598
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:32,910
Manickam uncle on the line

1599
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:34,330
Don't pick up his call

1600
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:36,290
Are you having a tough time?

1601
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:37,830

You want me to grace your weddingand you'll perform a funeral at my house!

1608
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,120
What do you mean?

1609
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,750
Your sister consumed poisonand is rushed to the hospital

1610
01:29:58,790 --> 01:30:02,080
If anything happens to hernone of you will be alive

1611
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,330
- What, uncle?- 3rd sister drank poison

1612
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:07,250
Cry baby has started her antics

1613
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:09,410
Wonder what she will do next

1614
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:13,830
Don't give any treatment

1615
01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:16,250
I need to know one wayor the other or die

1616
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:18,040
Doesn't look likeshe consumed poison

1617
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,410
Why did you try to kill yourself?Please treat her

1618
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:22,040
Why will I consume poison?

1619
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,750
The girl you promised to marrytried committing suicide

1620
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:26,950
She's on her death-bed

1621
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:34,410
Are you mad?

1622
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,790
Why did you do this?

1623
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:40,040
Students easily opt for suicideIs this what you were taught?

1624
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,080
I'll clobber you

1625
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:44,330
- Administer first aid, sir- That lady isn't letting us treat her

1626
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:46,200
We've administered first aid

1627
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,500
Promise me you will marry her

1628
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,080
Otherwise let her die

1629
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,500
I can't take her backand look after her

1630
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:54,700
Are you a lunatic?

1631
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:57,950
I'll kill you though you're my akkaIs this the time for melodrama?

1632
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,410
Either marry her or take her corpseand throw it away somewhere

1633
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:09,160
What is this, my dear?

1634
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:11,950
Is it our wish to see you like this?

1635
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:16,330
Is my Chellamma a coward?

1636
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:20,250
You don't have any cluewhy I took this decision, right?

1637
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:22,790
Okay, dear

1638
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:26,620
I'll talk to my girlfriend and marry you

1639
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:27,950
'Which room?'

1640
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:32,410
I thought you committed suicideYou've driven our only child to this state

1641
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,620
I won't let anyone near her

1642
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,330
Call the policeCall the Press

1643
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:37,660
Stop your medication

1644
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,330
Why call the Press when I'm here?

1645
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:40,790
No need to call anyone

1646
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:42,950
I'm ready to promise

1647
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,540
Take her hand and promise her

1648
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,290
Then my daughter won't die

1649
01:31:58,370 --> 01:31:59,950
Aiyaiyo!

1650
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:04,250
Grandpa had a heart attackHe is in a critical condition

1651
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:05,410
Come, uncle

1652
01:32:05,450 --> 01:32:06,910
Aiyaiyo! My father!

1653
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,790
Get yourself treatedWe'll discuss this later

1654
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:11,250
- Doctor, attend to her- Quick!

1655
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:12,620
We'll take careYou go, bro

1656
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:16,120
Your father is fineNothing is wrong with him

1657
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,790
- I lied- Playing with my father's life?

1658
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:19,870
Then what?

1659
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:22,410
That man says his wifetried to commit suicide

1660
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:24,080
And here the daughter is dying

1661
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,620
Obvious her mother hasapplied poison on her lips

1662
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:28,620
Oblivious, you're promising her

1663
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:30,620
How will you faceyour girlfriend?

1664
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,000
I agree my sister is quite capable

1665
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,620
But Chellamma won't act

1666
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:37,410
Her eyes asked me'Are you planning to kill me?'

1667
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:39,160
Haven't I blundered?

1668
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:41,830
I don't know whyI met Kannukiniyal

1669
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,330
- I am to blame for everything- Why do you think this way?

1670
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,660
- Who was on the phone?- No one

1671
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,660
Who was overhearingour conversation?

1672
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:54,830
Kannukiniyal

1673
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:56,330
She wasn't overhearing

1674
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:59,290
I told her about your strugglesto get everyone's consent

1675
01:32:59,330 --> 01:33:02,910
She asked me to record everythingto know what you're going through for her

1676
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,370
From when is she hearing?

1677
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:06,830
From when we wentto that cry baby's house

1678
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:08,830
Playing havoc with my life?

1679
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:10,370
That isn't true

1680
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:12,500
Get lost!Don't ever see me again

1681
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:14,290
Uncle, don't get me wrong

1682
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,500
Grant me a separation

1683
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:54,540
Aren't you ashamed to say this?

1684
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,290
Let me divorce my husband

1685
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:59,500
You're 60 years oldWhy do you need a divorce now?

1686
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:01,950
- Won't you be the laughing stock?- So what?

1687
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:04,620
When he was 50 andwanted a son as his heir...

1688
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,410
...wasn't he the laughing stock?

1689
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:08,700
How can you deride him?He's like God to us

1690
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,080
You'll rot in hell

1691
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:14,290
Enough, ma, I have facedenough insults in this house

1692
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:16,450
At least now I wantto have peace of mind

1693
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,290
Without magnifying this issuegrant me a divorce

1694
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:21,250
How can you talk like this?

1695
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:23,870
Are you creating problems?

1696
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:28,330
You are the oneshurting my daughter and me

1697
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:31,790
Your father was looking fora bride outside our family

1698
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:35,580
Your mother didn't evenask me if I wanted to or not

1699
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:38,540
She told me to marry your father

1700
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,790
I buried all my dreams and goals

1701
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:45,040
I married my brother-in-lawonly to make him happy

1702
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:52,040
But God gave me just 1 girl childinstead of blessing me with a son

1703
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:55,700
Such an innocent girlSilent as a saint

1704
01:34:55,950 --> 01:35:01,160
I pleaded saying the groomchosen for her doesn't seem desirable

1705
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:03,870
He claimed the groomwas from a decent family

1706
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:09,250
Within 2 years of marriagethat drunkard made my daughter a widow

1707
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:15,410
Just because she stubbornly refusedto remarry, you abandoned her completely

1708
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,870
When even at 65-70a companion is needed...

1709
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:21,750
...did you think of the feelingsof a 25 year old?

1710
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,950
You praised my granddaughter Andal

1711
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,950
You nurtured hopes in herof being the daughter-in-law

1712
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,870
To save the cost of payingfor a servant...

1713
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:34,660
...haven't you been treatingAndal as a glorified maid?

1714
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,540
Enough of this torture

1715
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:40,410
I'll take care of my daughterand granddaughter

1716
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:43,620
Ma...waitWhere are you going?

1717
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:45,410
- Let me go- Let's talk it over

1718
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:46,830
Let her go

1719
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:48,120
Listen to me

1720
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,290
- Wait, ma- Don't stop her

1721
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:53,750
'You madcap!Are you still thinking of him?'

1722
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:06,950
I need to talk to you, my dear lad

1723
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,370
- Shall I come tomorrow?- I'll prefer if you can come today

1724
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,700
I'll be there

1725
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:16,700
- Please come- 'Vanakkam'

1726
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:20,750
However angry you may behow can you be so rude?

1727
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,410
Good morning

1728
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:24,580
- Serve them coffee- Okay, dear

1729
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:27,250
This is my younger sister

1730
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,540
Greetings

1731
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,910
She's the one your fatherpromised to marry

1732
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:33,950
She's vehement I shouldn'ttake you as my son-in-law

1733
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,500
We conduct our functions usuallyon the full moon day in April

1734
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:42,120
So this wedding has to take placeon that auspicious day

1735
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:47,000
I heard your family members are alsonot seeing eye to eye on this alliance

1736
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:50,750
My wife's brothersare on a warpath

1737
01:36:50,830 --> 01:36:52,660
We have just 30 days left

1738
01:36:59,290 --> 01:37:00,870
How can you think of suicide?

1739
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:03,040
What if it had turned fatal?

1740
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:05,200
Why are we here as your aunts?

1741
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:07,410
Will we let some strangermarry your uncle?

1742
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:10,000
- As if we will- Listen, child

1743
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,830
Only you will marry our brother

1744
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:13,250
No one can change this

1745
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:15,000
Will you all just keep quiet?

1746
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:18,620
What do you all think of yourselves?

1747
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:21,750
You claimed my uncle will marry meright from my childhood

1748
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:23,450
Have you come to console me now?

1749
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:27,410
- I don't want to get married- Why show your anger on the flower pots?

1750
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:29,870
- Get lost!- Are you mad or what?

1751
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:32,290
She is in a mad furyLet her be

1752
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:33,830
Let her vent it out

1753
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:37,160
If anyone tries to pair upa boy and girl in their childhood

1754
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,830
...my slippers will speak!

1755
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,040
What is happening, huh?

1756
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:44,410
Can Manickam's daughterresort to suicide?

1757
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:46,750
Your brother lied sayinghis father is unwell

1758
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:48,950
...went and fixed the wedding date!

1759
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,870
This is disgustingI don't know why I'm alive!

1760
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:56,330
Won't the 3 of us find a wellto jump into and die?

1761
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:57,950
Wells are dry nowadays

1762
01:37:57,950 --> 01:38:00,370
Oleander seeds will beour next option

1763
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:02,540
- What is the time, Safari?- 10 o' clock

1764
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,830
10+2 hours from nowif we commit suicide

1765
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:06,700
Let a crowd gather to grieve here

1766
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:07,950
Is it some circus trick?

1767
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:09,950
You bet, watch my circus act

1768
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:12,410
Co-brother-in-law

1769
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:15,870
He bought 'the stuff' just beforehis daughter was discharged

1770
01:38:15,910 --> 01:38:18,660
It's quite a feat to findthe right shop in the city

1771
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:20,830
How does he getsuch easy access to liquor?

1772
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:22,620
You have your own problem

1773
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:25,290
This is the problem ofentire Tamil Nadu, I say

1774
01:38:25,330 --> 01:38:27,660
Co-brother-in-lawPlease come out

1775
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:29,540
Whatever it islet's discuss it

1776
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:32,750
I can see your love for your niecebrimming and bubbling!

1777
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:35,370
What did all of you doall this while?

1778
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:38,830
You think I didn't know you saidhe could marry outside our family

1779
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:40,200
What is it?

1780
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:42,370
- Some snack I ate- I'll call back

1781
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:45,370
This husband of the spy squad!

1782
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:47,790
He will always act busy

1783
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,700
Kindly don't malign me

1784
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:53,500
Listen, anyway I intend to die

1785
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:57,330
Before that can I share the feelingsI've bottled up for decades?

1786
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,870
- Tell me, bro- Please stop wearing this Safari suit

1787
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:01,080
It's unbearable

1788
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:04,620
At least will you attend my funeralattired in a traditional 'veshti'

1789
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:05,950
- Brother-in-law?- What?

1790
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,290
Don't talk like a broken record, go inside

1791
01:39:08,330 --> 01:39:09,950
Spy-chief, shut up!

1792
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,160
He will brew some more trouble now!

1793
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,160
Will you stop being negative?

1794
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:15,540
'Adding fuel to the fire!'

1795
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:21,250
What is this?What are you doing?

1796
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:22,950
Why did you bring kerosene now?

1797
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,620
Turning on the motor?

1798
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,790
- What happened?- All of you are in a tearing hurry

1799
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:29,160
I'll die right here

1800
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,410
Oh my goodness!

1801
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:33,830
Give our 'safari' bro the moneyto arrange my funeral rites

1802
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:36,540
- Don't do this, uncle- Allow me to die

1803
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:38,500
- Stop this- I have to die now

1804
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:40,540
- Thamarai, it’s risky- Death is beckoning me

1805
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:42,620
Safari, he's looking for the matches

1806
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,950
Grab the matchbox from him

1807
01:39:45,330 --> 01:39:48,330
Are you trying to take usalong with you?

1808
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:51,160
Aiyaiyo! Save yourselves

1809
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:52,620
Where's the water?

1810
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:54,250
Pour it on my fatherNot on you

1811
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:55,950
Selfish buffalo!Give it to me

1812
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:57,580
Pour water on him

1813
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:59,500
He was about to kill all of us

1814
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:01,290
What a horrible family!

1815
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:02,700
Go to hell

1816
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:04,370
Leave me out of this

1817
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:06,120
Don’t, co-bro-in-law

1818
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,950
'- What, akka?- Do you have power in your house?'

1819
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:10,080
Sivakami?

1820
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:11,500
Who is she?

1821
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:13,790
To step into our houseand boss over us

1822
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:15,910
Wait...please listen to me

1823
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:20,200
Your own family has 2 factionsregarding your brother's bride

1824
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:21,830
That's the biggest hassle here

1825
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:23,660
A family can indulge in politics

1826
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,620
But can there be politics in a family?

1827
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:28,040
Let him choose Chellamma or Andal

1828
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,660
But that soda-girl can't butt in

1829
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:32,540
'Our brother should marryonly one of our daughters'

1830
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:41,000
Please don’t do this

1831
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:47,830
Can I have some more porridge?

1832
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:51,950
'Glutton of a fellow!'

1833
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:57,950
You've befriended Gunasingam it seems

1834
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:59,950
The boys told meI didn't believe them

1835
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:02,700
Yes, uncle, it's 100% true

1836
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,250
I don't like him, dear

1837
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:08,370
But I like him very much, uncle

1838
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:10,080
Delete him from your mind

1839
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,540
Doesn't augur well for himnor is it good for you

1840
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:14,540
I know to decide my life

1841
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,750
I must trample his temerity

1842
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,040
I must wipe out his wealth

1843
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:27,790
Only then he should die a slow death

1844
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:42,700
Sorry, dear, I misunderstood younot aware of your situation

1845
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:43,950
Angry with me?

1846
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:46,580
Nothing, I just feel so lonely

1847
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:52,410
You don't sound yourself

1848
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:56,200
Wow! You know my moodgauging my voice, huh?

1849
01:41:56,250 --> 01:42:00,120
One glance from youI can tell if you are happy or sad

1850
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,410
I want to see you right now

1851
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:07,700
Is that so?

1852
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,200
Now close your eyes

1853
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:23,500
In our bedroom

1854
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:27,750
After a hard day's workyou are eagerly waiting for me

1855
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:29,870
I take a refreshing shower

1856
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:35,290
I come and lie down next to youin your favorite pink nighty

1857
01:42:35,330 --> 01:42:37,950
I hug you real tight

1858
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:40,620
I kiss you on your forehead

1859
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:42,500
On your eyelids

1860
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:45,750
Then your lips

1861
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:56,500
My precious princessI want to bring you home very soon

1862
01:42:57,450 --> 01:43:02,160
In all your silken finerymake you mine as my wife

1863
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:10,660
I feel like starting my lifewith you right now, dear

01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:43,790
"Come to me, my dear shrewI'll tame you and win over you"

1865
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:48,950
"Like a cat on a hot tin roof, darlingI'm waiting to follow you, drooling"

1866
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:54,410
"My dear wildcat, come to meI'll win over you desirously"

1867
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:59,540
"Like a cat protecting her kittenI want to follow you, totally smitten"

1868
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:04,910
"If you go away from me, honeymy heart beats lub-dub horny"

1869
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:10,500
"Even this landlord's words, honeystutter and stammer in agony"

1870
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:13,410
"Say 'yes' to stick to me, sweetie"

"I pick the tempo and sing for youYou arch my neck and kiss my throat too"

1875
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:13,250
"The whole town looks up to meas if I am worship-worthy"

1876
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:18,160
"One look at you, I wonder whyI stand stranded mid-road on a high"

1877
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:23,450
"I swear on God, it's trueI don't want to live without you"

1878
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:28,500
"I am not kidding, my dearCome near to whisper in my ear"

1879
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:31,540
"What happened in my mind, crystal clear?"

1880
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:37,290
"My dear wildcat, come to meI'll win over you rapturously"

1881

1883
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:53,080
"Even this landlord's words stutter in agony"

1884
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:56,160
"Say 'yes' to stick to me, sweetie"

"Come to me, o' beloved shrewI'll tame you and win over you"

1886
01:46:01,330 --> 01:46:06,700
"Like a cat on a hot tin roof, darlingI'm waiting to follow you, drooling"

1887
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:15,580
They have destroyedall our banana trees, sir

1888
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:18,950
Completely decimated them to the ground

1889
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:24,120
Aiyo! God help us!

1890
01:46:24,830 --> 01:46:27,370
How could anyone do this to us?

1891
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:29,040
Wretched scumbags

1892
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:31,750
Clear everything and use it as manure

1893
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:34,950
Our son sees thishe will be heartbroken

1894
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,750
He won't be able to bear this

1895
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:42,870
Both our bulls are lying lifelessfoaming in their mouths

1896
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:45,500
They were like his own brothers

1897
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:48,750
They destroyed everything

1898
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:51,040
Will he be able to handle this?

1899
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:52,910
Heartless brutes!

1900
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:57,250
We treated them like our own children

1901
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:05,450
How could they do this?

1902
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,620
What happened?

1903
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:19,250
What happened tomy Ram and Lakshman?

1904
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:22,200
Don't go andsee that sight

1905
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:23,660
You can't handle it

1906
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:25,910
- What happened, pa?- Don't go...please

1907
01:47:29,410 --> 01:47:31,250
We’ll seek our revenge

1908
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:34,450
- Let me see them just once- No need, son

1909
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:38,790
We'll retaliateAvenge their death

1910
01:48:06,410 --> 01:48:08,830
We buried them in our fields

1911
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:15,000
Look how desolate this place is

1912
01:48:16,910 --> 01:48:19,410
'They used to win all the races'

1913
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:22,450
Aiya

1914
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:26,870
5000 banana trees, 2 bullsyou reared with loads of love

1915
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,120
Imagine everything being wiped out

1916
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:32,660
Whoever it iswill be heartbroken

1917
01:48:36,870 --> 01:48:37,950
What is it, sir?

1918
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:40,000
Such a huge tragedy in your house

1919
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:42,870
The family hasn't united?Did someone drive a wedge?

1920
01:48:42,910 --> 01:48:44,250
Gunasingam?

1921
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:46,290
Mourning, huh?

1922
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:49,580
You made me chopall the mesquite trees, eh?

1923
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,750
My boys who felt terriblewatching me do so

1924
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,950
May be they killed your bullsand razed your plantation

1925
01:48:58,910 --> 01:49:00,950
I should have killed you right then

1926
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,370
Let go of me

1927
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:04,580
I'll close your chapter one day

1928
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:07,410
What did my poor bulls do to you?

1929
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:09,410
Ask them not to restrain me, pa

1930
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:11,830
Gunasingam, listen to me

1931
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:15,200
I'll kill your entire family

1932
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:16,950
Take him inside

1933
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,120
I won't spare you

1934
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:31,500
What the hell?Just trees after all

1935
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,750
I would have killed himif bro had ordered

1936
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:34,910
He will order that too!

1937
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:36,620
Hey! Gunasingam

1938
01:49:36,790 --> 01:49:39,200
- Run for your life- Let's escape

1939
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:41,620
You've come over to our sideThen why sulk like this?

1940
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:43,660
Can you get a better groomthan Kodiyarasu?

1941
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:46,370
Let this party-meeting get overWatch his realm of influence!

1942
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,290
I'll always be your pillar of strength

1943
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:51,580
Whatever help you needyou can ask without hesitating

1944
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:55,200
Your brother-in-law has deceived youpretending to be good

1945
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:57,040
He needs a good lesson to be taught

1946
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:00,200
Don't feel badhe isn't your son-in-law

1947
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:02,290
I will marry her

1948
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:04,500
Will you consent?

1949
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:06,700
Share your opinioninstead of snoring

1950
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:09,620
What is there to think in this?We didn't initiate this

1951
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:12,500
He made the moveThen why hesitate?

1952
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:14,750
Only then Gunasingam will pipe down

1953
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:16,200
I agree wholeheartedly

1954
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:18,540
- We'll do as you say- A decision well made!

1955
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:32,580
Akka...?

1956
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:40,830
Ma...?

1957
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,250
Come back home with me

1958
01:50:43,290 --> 01:50:45,450
It is just not the same without you

1959
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:49,040
I was waiting for youto come back of your own accord

1960
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:51,580
Let's go home

1961
01:50:56,790 --> 01:51:00,500
It never occurred to you tocome home even after all this debacle?

1962
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:01,660
Come, ma

1963
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:07,450
Akka...!

1964
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,330
Hey Andal

1965
01:51:09,790 --> 01:51:11,500
Have you also joined with them?

1966
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:13,750
You won't talk?

1967
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:15,290
You won't talk to me?

1968
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:21,080
What is amma saying?

1969
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:22,790
Did I treat her like a servant?

1970
01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:23,910
Akka?

1971
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:27,120
Look at me now

1972
01:51:27,370 --> 01:51:28,700
I'm talking to you

1973
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:30,250
You always support me

1974
01:51:30,290 --> 01:51:31,790
How can you be like this?

1975
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:34,250
I'll leave if you say'Get out, you mongrel!'

1976
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:36,290
Don't be like this, akka

1977
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:40,250
You don't even want tolook at my face?

1978
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:49,500
Go now, one day you'll comeyearning for my love and affection

1979
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:04,790
Uncle

1980
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:08,870
I won't be here if I thoughtI was just your nephew

1981
01:52:08,910 --> 01:52:11,290
We've been childhood friends

1982
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:12,620
That's why I came

1983
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:14,290
So many weird happenings

1984
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:16,120
Parisutham has changed sides

1985
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:19,290
He's trying many waysto stop your marriage

1986
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:23,200
They are planning to get Chellammamarried to Kodiyarasu

1987
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:29,250
You have fixed a groom for Chellamma

1988
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:30,700
That lowlife!

1989
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,700
He's the groomSo what?

1990
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:36,160
That murderer is my niece's fiance, huh?

1991
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:38,700
Don't make me furiousI'll kill all of you

You found yourself a bride, right?

1995
01:52:45,790 --> 01:52:47,790
Won't a groom offerto marry my daughter?

1996
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:49,200
- Go- What is this, akka?

1997
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:52,200
Who are you to decidemy daughter's groom?

1998
01:52:53,410 --> 01:52:55,200
She's the apple of our eyes, akka

1999
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:57,580
Don't ruin her lifebecause you're mad at me

2000
01:52:58,410 --> 01:53:00,950
I am glad you areso concerned about her

2001
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:04,500
But fate decides her life, right?

2002

2003
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:10,410

He is a drunkard, they aregetting you married to a murderer

2006
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:17,620
Do you think I'll allow this?

2007
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:19,120
Don't worryLet's go home

2008
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:21,120
- Come home- Who are you to drag her?

2009
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:22,580
Are you deaf or what?

2010
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,450
You chose your life, right?

2011
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:26,330
- Get lost!- I can't go away like that

2012
01:53:26,370 --> 01:53:29,160
He's dragging my daughterAnd you're watching silently

2013
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:31,330
As her parents, won't we care?

2014
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:33,120
I can't do thatI am your uncle

2015
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:36,120
I'm restraining myselfbecause you're my brother-in-law

2016
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:39,450
- Come away, uncle- Leave her alone

2017
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:42,580
Let me see how he conducts the wedding

2018
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:45,790
I won't let this happenas long as I'm alive

2019
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:47,910
I’m curbing all the cuss words!

2020
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:51,200
- Have they shut shop?- You'll get it, rear side

2021
01:53:51,250 --> 01:53:56,700
Uncle, you said you would rather resortto murder but you'll never drink

2022
01:53:56,950 --> 01:53:58,620
Yes, I said so

2023
01:53:58,870 --> 01:54:01,620
Padmavathy akka's husband diedbecause he was an alcoholic

2024
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:03,790
That's why I took that vow

2025
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:05,950
They insulted me too much

2026
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
They said liquor will numb the pain

2027
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:10,290
But it pains all the more now

2028
01:54:10,950 --> 01:54:13,250
Our family was so happy and united

2029
01:54:13,410 --> 01:54:15,700
Today our house is shrouded in sadness

2030
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:19,580
Let it go, one daythey will also cry in misery

2031
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:22,410
She blames me for everything

2032
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:27,080
This is why we shouldn't heaploads of love on anyone

2033
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,450
Either we will be hurt severely

2034
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:31,450
Or we will end up hurting someone

2035
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:34,700
This is exactly whyI don't get too fond of anyone

2036
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:36,500
No one will be fond of me either

2037
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:38,620
Then aren't you fond of me?

2038
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:40,830
Uncle, let's go inside

2039
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:43,120
That's a templeI won't step in

2040
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,790
Nowadays temple isthe hub of all activities!

2041
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:47,790
I’ll be with Ram and Lakshman here

2042
01:54:47,830 --> 01:54:50,290
- I'll sleep here- Uncle, come in

2043
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:52,450
'Get up, uncle'

2044
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:56,080
I never thought I'll seemy son in this pathetic state

2045
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:57,870
- 'Get up, uncle'- I am scared

2046
01:54:57,910 --> 01:55:00,950
Assemble the whole family heretomorrow morning

2047
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:03,120
We'll decide once for all

2048
01:55:04,210 --> 01:55:07,250
Hey Rani, will you take me there or not?

2049
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:09,000
Grandma, won't you listen?

2050
01:55:09,050 --> 01:55:10,340
I don't want you to go there

2051
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:11,880
I have to go today

2052
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:14,090
I've been waiting for this day

2053
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:21,130
Iniya, wait in the car

01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,840

2055
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,170

2059
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:35,090
- Nothing, thank you- 'Vanakkam'

2060
01:55:37,170 --> 01:55:40,630
You must be confusedwhy I barged in like this

2061
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,250
I didn't have an option

2062
01:55:42,550 --> 01:55:47,420
When Iniya was returning from college4 boys have created a ruckus yesterday

2063
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:49,170
She somehow tackled them

2064
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:52,960
I found out they weremy brother-in-law's goons

2065
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,500

I am also ageing

2087

You like the Kazhani house, right?

You take it

2094
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:16,920

I don't want anything, pa

2096
01:57:20,210 --> 01:57:23,090
Your father has some hidden agenda

2097
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:24,840
Ask him what the hitch is

2098
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:27,670
1st ask what he is giving his son

2099
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:31,050
What are you giving your son?

2100
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:35,500
I asked if he wants propertyor the girl he loves?

2101
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:37,590
He's saying he can earn

2102
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:40,960
You've agreed to him marryingthat girl, 1st tell us that

2103
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:42,460
Let him marry

2104
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:44,340
Hey, listen carefully

2105
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:46,880
You will not get a nayapaisafrom my property

2106
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:49,710
Then it means we are eyeingyour wealth, right?

2107
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:50,960
Not like that, dear

2108
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,710
It is my duty tosettle you in life

2109
01:57:52,750 --> 01:57:54,670
Why all of a sudden?

2110
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,250
Everything is happening suddenly

2111
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:03,420
What can be done if somethinguntoward happens to me suddenly?

2112
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:05,500
Shhh! Get lost

2113
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:10,630
Alright

2114
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:15,960
If he was penniless, will so manycome forward to make him their son-in-law?

2115
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:18,340
It's all because of money

2116
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:22,170
So if I get rid of that wretched wealth,the problem is solved, right?

2117
01:58:22,210 --> 01:58:25,170
You think we wanted your sonbecause of your wealth?

2118
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:26,960
Not due to family ties or affection

2119
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,170
Did we want this alliancefor his good heart or his money?

2120
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:31,750
Why are you talking like this?

2121
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:33,210
Don't I know your affection?

2122
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:35,500
- Heard the sarcasm?- Keep quiet, uncle

2123
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:39,130
Girls, don't you stillunderstand your father?

2124
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:43,880
He will fix a price, distribute his wealthand then get his son married

2125
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,210
He has made you all sit out here

2126
01:58:46,250 --> 01:58:50,300
He has made the girl's fathersit inside to spy on us

2127
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:53,960
And that gentleman toois eavesdropping on this discussion

2128
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,420
- I thought so- Is this the 'fresh air' you like?

2129
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:59,000
Look how much he respects us, sir

2130
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:00,710
1st day is feast ona banana leaf

2131
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:03,000
Next day a hand-made leaf,then just a handful

2132
01:59:03,050 --> 01:59:04,420
4th day on the floor

2133
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:06,050
Is this the time for proverbs?

2134
01:59:06,090 --> 01:59:07,960
- Let's go- Wait, uncle

2135
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:10,050
Why do you nit-pickwith an acid tongue?

2136
01:59:10,090 --> 01:59:11,750
I'm nit picking, huh?

2137
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,460
Old member is no longer neededThe new guest is family!

2138
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:16,380
Are father and son insulting me?

2139
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:18,170
I did not ask him to come

2140
01:59:18,210 --> 01:59:20,800
He came suddenlyof his own accord

2141
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:22,500
To discuss an alliance

2142
01:59:22,550 --> 01:59:25,300
You can even call me 'da'if I enter this house again

2143
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,380
Did you hear that?All the sisters have assembled

2144
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:29,880
'Problem is just brewing'

2145
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,840
My Thekkadi lineage is not so cheap

2146
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:33,050
Don't go, uncle

2147
01:59:33,090 --> 01:59:35,250
If you are coming, come right away

2148
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:36,920
Or choose your parents over me

2149
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,590
If you leavewhy should I stay behind?

2150
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:41,920
If you knot up problemshow can we solve this?

2151
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:44,340
I knot everythingWho are you to talk to me?

2152
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:45,840
What did you say?

2153
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,170
Think back

2154
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:49,340
Look how everyone isbutting in to mediate

2155
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:51,210
Are you showing off your favors?

2156
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:52,590
Yes, you can-

2157
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:56,210
Hey, did you hear that?How well we are respected?

2158
01:59:56,250 --> 01:59:58,800
If you can cut your ties todaycome with me

2159
01:59:58,840 --> 02:00:00,670
Send your sacred thread with someone

2160
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:02,130
Why are you cutting all ties?

2161
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:04,250
Why do I need any bond after this?

2162
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:06,500
I have no ties with this family

2163
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:08,630
I won't attend even a funeral here

2164
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:09,800
'Shut up!'

2165
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,050
Very happy

2166
02:00:11,090 --> 02:00:14,380
People who don't want tounderstand me, please leave

2167
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:17,710
If akka is furiouswhy do you make it worse?

2168
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:23,590
The relationship betweenmy family and yours has ended

2169
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:26,630
If my husband dies,you'll give a sari for the last rites

2170
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:28,300
Give that to me now

2171
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:31,460
You'll attend the funeralsaying you are my father

2172
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:33,250
He will come as my brother

2173
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:37,340
Give me the sari nowI'll walk out of your life

2174
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:41,750
Instead of burning with animosityfuneral pyre is better

2175
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,420
Don't talk emotionally

2176
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:46,710
Go in, get a sari andfling it on her face

2177
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:50,550
This is how much you love us?

2178
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:53,000
This isn't how our family usually is

2179
02:00:53,050 --> 02:00:56,460
Someone is instigating all thisPlease don't lose your temper

2180
02:00:56,550 --> 02:00:58,340
Akka, stop this nonsense

2181
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:00,460
- Go bring the sari- 'Be patient, akka'

2182
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:03,250
- What is this, dear?- Otherwise you leave

2183
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:08,630
Amma, wait, don't go

2184
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:11,750
'You heard what he said?'

2185
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:12,880
Don't do this

2186
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,920
Will we also face this same fate?

2187
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:17,300
Your action is unjust to say the least

2188
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:19,210
- Big blunder- Yes, dear

2189
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:20,920
You are right

2190
02:01:21,590 --> 02:01:24,750
Pretending to be righteousyou're ruining our togetherness

2191
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:27,840
Only the 4 sons-in-laware from different wombs

2192
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:29,300
So they behave differently

2193
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:31,460
The four of you are born to the same mother

2194
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:32,920
How are you so different?

2195
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:35,500
We wanted a sononly to stand by you

2196
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:38,460
When he is in trouble,none of you stood by him

2197
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:40,500
Like our bulls and banana trees

2198
02:01:40,590 --> 02:01:42,500
...everything has been destroyed

2199
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:44,050
The whole town enquired

2200
02:01:44,090 --> 02:01:46,170
But none of you bothered to visit us

2201
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:52,050
He who makes everyone gladthe world loves to watch him sad

2202
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:56,000
But I don't want my son to be unhappy

2203
02:01:56,590 --> 02:02:00,420
I'll create a ruckus in Gunasingam's houseI'll deal with the repercussions

2204
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:03,840
The other day I wasthe one who told him

2205
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:08,500
If 1 of your sisters or brothers-in-laware absent, this wedding won't take place

2206
02:02:08,590 --> 02:02:10,500
Where are you going?Sit in the car

2207
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:13,880
Whether you attend and blessor you don't show your face...

2208
02:02:14,130 --> 02:02:15,750
...he will still get married

2209
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:17,210
Give that to me

2210
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:20,710
Only his happiness matters to me

2211
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:24,340
All of you forgive me

2212
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:27,670
I don't want you to fight

2213
02:02:28,210 --> 02:02:29,960
I don't want to ruin your unity

2214
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:32,000
Your daughter can marry your brother

2215
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:34,750
I don't want to be the causefor a feud in your family

2216
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:36,960
- It's warming up- Strike now

2217
02:02:37,210 --> 02:02:39,960
Giving a sari for her as a widowAll this is taking an ugly turn

2218
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,420
What is ugly?Who are you in the first place?

2219
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:44,250
Don't lose your coolPlease be calm

2220
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:45,880
Don't talk without any sense

2221
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,250
Who is talking nonsense, da?

2222
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:49,590
Don't you treatmy father with scant respect

2223
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:50,960
Bro-in-law, be respectful

2224
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:52,750
- Trying to hit me?- What is this, machan?

2225
02:02:52,750 --> 02:02:54,880
Who is arguingwith my brother-in-law?

2226
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:57,000
How dare you raise your hand?

2227
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,880
[overlap of angry voices]

2228
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:01,550
Get out!

2229
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:04,000

2258
02:06:01,420 --> 02:06:03,840
Grandma, will you do me a favor?

2259
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:06,210
Tell me what I should do, dear?

2260

'Till date I've never askedany of you for anything'

2261
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:16,960
I have reached 90 now

2262
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:22,130
If you perform a ritualin the temple for my well being

2263

I will die in peace

2264

I am not a mini busto comply to all your wishes

2265
02:06:30,210 --> 02:06:34,000
In a single day's downpouryou have all dissolved like sugar

2266
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:36,380
I carried 6 in my womband I gave birth to 2

2267
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:38,800
I didn't nurse you,that's the only difference

2268
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:42,000
'There is no oneeven to comfort me'

2269
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,090
Who will step into that house?

2270
02:06:44,170 --> 02:06:46,590
It can be held in a templeor some common venue

2271
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:50,590
Nachiyar, if you set your mind to itonly you can unite this family

2272
02:06:51,710 --> 02:06:54,960
My youngest, if you don'tvisit me when I am alive

2273
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:58,710
...if you lament loudlyand garland me as a corpse

2274
02:06:58,750 --> 02:07:00,840
...will I even be aware of your grief?

2275
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:06,590
'Please change the seat in your bike'

2276
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:10,210
'Throwing me up and downmy bones are all rattling'

2277
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:12,840
What happened?Did they all agree to attend?

2278
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:14,880
Even rain will bless grandma

2279
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:16,420
As if my sisters won't?

2280
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,960
If they go up,they have to come down

2281
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:24,880
- Grandma, get ready- For what?

2282
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:27,670
- Your mother's function- I'm not coming

2283
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:31,630
How many temples G-grandma hasvisited for our well-being

2284
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,500
Shouldn't we cheerfully attend?

2285
02:07:33,550 --> 02:07:34,710
I am not coming

2286
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:36,670

He's pretending he got a call

2298
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:10,590
'Everything is in placeas per our plan'

2299
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:12,460
No one should be alive in this family

2300
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:14,380
We end all the insults I faced

2301
02:08:15,090 --> 02:08:16,300
Tell me

2302
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:20,420

What happened?

2304
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:25,380
I am respected in this villagefor my lineage

2305
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:28,960
I can't sacrifice itfor the feast served here

2306
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:31,340
They have invited all kinds of stray dogs!

2307
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:34,420
Oh! My dear

2308
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,630
- Wait, listen to me- I can't give up my dignity

2309
02:08:37,050 --> 02:08:40,420
Why is the mini busmaking an U-turn?

2310
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:42,380
Welcome, sister

2311
02:08:43,250 --> 02:08:44,500

Greetings, brother

2321
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:23,750
Brother, they have plannedto cause a commotion

2322
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:25,880
And kill you

2323
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:28,460
Is it so?How many of them?

2324
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:30,550
Only they know the plan

2325
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:33,750
Be on your guardwith your brothers-in-law

2326
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,590
All their palms havebeen greased, be alert

2327
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:38,460
I shall take leave

2328
02:09:40,130 --> 02:09:43,840
Why do you give himthe respect he doesn't deserve?

2329
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:46,170
Will he be the only one to spy on us?

2330
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:49,460
Even I have set up spies inthe enemy camp, he's one of us

2331
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:51,840
We can handle it

2332
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:06,710
Bless you, my dear

2333
02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:09,130

02:10:15,050 --> 02:10:16,380
Sister, your turn

2338
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:25,460
You are bearing a cross, dear

2339
02:10:25,670 --> 02:10:28,090
It isn't an easy burden to carry

2340
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:31,550
Your good heart willalways keep you happy

2341
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:36,670

2342
02:10:38,670 --> 02:10:40,380

Hello...you

2344
02:10:43,210 --> 02:10:46,090
Those who graced this occasionplease stay for the feast

2345
02:10:46,130 --> 02:10:49,550
Why do you sulk and look grimlike you are a stranger?

2346
02:10:49,590 --> 02:10:51,090
If you are angry, yell at him

2347
02:10:51,090 --> 02:10:53,210
Don't hoard ill feelings

2348
02:10:53,460 --> 02:10:55,170
Even fire has to extinguish

2349
02:10:55,710 --> 02:10:57,210
Please eat, dear

2350
02:10:57,590 --> 02:11:00,710
I am being magnanimousbecause I'm your son-in-law

2351
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:02,380
Don't wash dirty linen here

2352
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:05,340
All you have is a big fat egoand false prestige, uncle

2353
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:07,340
You think you're some fierce tiger

2354
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:08,420
Yes, da

2355
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:10,500
I am a fierce tigerSo what?

2356
02:11:10,590 --> 02:11:12,880
If you're angryunleash it, my dear

2357
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,340
Anger is like garbage

2358
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:15,630
Am I angry?

2359
02:11:15,670 --> 02:11:17,380
Can I just ask 1 question?

2360
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:19,550
How is that girl superior to my daughter?

2361
02:11:19,590 --> 02:11:21,340
Are you provoking me?

2362
02:11:22,420 --> 02:11:24,630
- Keep quiet- Don't you have any brains?

2363
02:11:24,670 --> 02:11:27,710
He is the main culpritHow can you go and talk to him?

2364
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,500
Pretending to be innocentand standing quietly

2365
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:33,840
He must have hidden his father-in-lawsomewhere here, let's go

2366
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,750
- What an act claiming to love me- Shut up, ma

2367
02:11:37,630 --> 02:11:38,960
Hey! Let go of me

2368
02:11:39,590 --> 02:11:41,920
- Sister, listen- Hear me out

2369
02:11:42,130 --> 02:11:44,420
I'll get my daughter married tomorrow

2370
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:48,880
If you attend claiming to be her uncleto participate in the function

2371
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:51,250
No tears, you'll seemy true colors

2372
02:11:52,210 --> 02:11:54,590
We worshipped youas our only brother

2373
02:11:54,630 --> 02:11:57,460
You broke all tieslike a mud pot

2374
02:11:57,710 --> 02:12:00,340
Whenever we had a family function

2375
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:02,840
...all 5 of us looked forwardto being together

2376
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:05,920
Catching up on our livesAll that has turned sour

2377
02:12:06,130 --> 02:12:08,420
Now no one even makes eye contact

2378
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:11,340
You ruined our happiness,for the sake of a stranger

2379
02:12:12,630 --> 02:12:14,670
What makes her so sweet and special?

2380
02:12:14,670 --> 02:12:18,500
Even now you're unable to reject herand agree to marrying your niece?

2381
02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:22,550
- He has no contact with her- Then why is she still unmarried?

2382
02:12:22,630 --> 02:12:25,630
As if we don't know your strategy

2383
02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:28,840
You'll rock the cradleand pinch the child!

2384
02:12:29,050 --> 02:12:31,710
Hold this, motherCan I tell you something?

2385
02:12:32,710 --> 02:12:34,090
Listen to me properly

2386
02:12:34,130 --> 02:12:35,500
We are in a temple

2387
02:12:35,630 --> 02:12:37,420
Touch your heartand tell me

2388
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:42,170
Has my son never been a loving brother?

2389
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:44,500
Because your husband is unemployed

2390
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:47,340
...he's paying interest for2 mini buses he bought for him

2391
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:51,000
He bought 2 tipper lorries on loanfor his younger brother-in-law too

2392
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,590
Paying monthly interest

2393
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:54,800
Didn't he educate your children?

2394
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:59,630
My son has deposited money in the bankfor the wedding of your 3 daughters!

2395
02:13:00,210 --> 02:13:02,500
Was he ever stingywith his trousseaux?

2396
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:06,500
For Deepavali, temple festivaleven every single birthday of-

2397
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:09,750
If you pinpoint what we didit is best left undone

2398
02:13:10,210 --> 02:13:12,420
Let my sister get the angerout of her system

2399
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:15,300
I'm not pinpointingI'm pricking their memory lapse

2400
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:17,130
Instead of one of my granddaughters...

2401
02:13:17,170 --> 02:13:19,920
...will I bring some girlas my daughter-in-law?

2402
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:24,090
He is an extrovert who goes outHe talks to people in a friendly manner

2403
02:13:24,630 --> 02:13:28,090
He may have likedher face or her character

2404
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:31,550
Burying my dreams deep inside...

2405
02:13:32,170 --> 02:13:36,090
I wanted to discharge my dutyas his mother in a proper manner

2406
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:41,250
How do you have the heart to beso cold and callous to malign my son?

2407
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:44,500
More than you and me regrettingyou didn't have a son...

2408
02:13:44,590 --> 02:13:46,800
...my son has been so remorseful

2409
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:50,250
More than your husbandwalking up and down hospital steps

2410
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:54,340
...he took you to so many hospitalslooking up to you as his beloved sister

2411
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:56,750
Not wanting you toregret being childless

2412
02:13:56,750 --> 02:14:01,090
...he stayed in your houseirrespective of any inconveniences

2413
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:03,170
To top it all

2414
02:14:03,250 --> 02:14:07,170
He wanted to be your son, to performyour last rites, when you pass away

2415
02:14:07,210 --> 02:14:10,920
Are you spoiling the wedding of this sonwho wanted to be a son to you?

2416
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:12,590
No one will tolerate this

2417
02:14:13,090 --> 02:14:14,960
Even God won't tolerate this

2418
02:14:17,170 --> 02:14:19,590
Hello...are you there?What's happening?

2419
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:23,880
None of you understood his good heart

2420
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:27,460
Our family deity!

2421
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:32,590
Even if we wash your feetand drink that water

2422
02:14:32,630 --> 02:14:35,090
...better sense won't prevail for us

2423
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:38,420
Am I your mother?

2424
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,630
Is my husband your father?

2425
02:14:41,670 --> 02:14:45,460
You have built a palacefor us in your heart

2426
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:48,550
How cruel of meto break your heart

2427
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:50,380
That isn't true, akka

2428
02:14:51,130 --> 02:14:54,880
- Please forgive us- There's nothing to forgive

2429
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:58,920
Is this why you were angry?

2430
02:14:59,050 --> 02:15:02,090
Unable to vent it outyou had long faces and turned away?

2431
02:15:04,170 --> 02:15:05,300
Scold me, akka

2432
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:07,420
You have every right

2433
02:15:08,170 --> 02:15:09,750
You can even beat me up

2434
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:12,000
I will accept whatever my sisters do

2435
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:14,880
But please don't ignore me and walk away

2436
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:17,460
I cannot bear that indifference

2437
02:15:20,630 --> 02:15:23,250
Whatever you are doingstems out of affection

2438
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:25,420
Whatever I'm doingis also out of love

2439
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:30,420
What are you blaming me for now?

2440
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:34,050
I didn't choose one of my niecesas my wife, right?

2441
02:15:34,090 --> 02:15:37,750
All of you always tell mehow you showered love on me

2442
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,500
The way my sisters cared for me...

2443
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:42,420
...I showered the same loveon my nieces

2444
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:45,880
You deposited them as babies onmy lap, made me sing lullabies

2445
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:48,550
Did you bring me upto treat them as my fiancee?

2446
02:15:48,750 --> 02:15:52,090
If I hadn't always been with themI might have fallen in love

2447
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:57,500
After cherishing them so muchI can't help treating them as my sisters

2448
02:15:57,670 --> 02:16:01,800
When I hug and look at their facesI can only see my sister and mother

2449
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:05,420
How can I think of her as my wife?

2450
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,840
If I marry herjust to satisfy your whim

2451
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:10,800
...won't both our lives be ruined?

2452
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:13,170
In order not to hurt my sister

2453
02:16:13,210 --> 02:16:15,210
And sever the uncle-niece bond...

2454
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:18,340
...a teenager was marriedto her 40 year old uncle

2455
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:21,840
Aren't we seeing how she isstruggling in life with a child today?

2456
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:25,590
If I marry Andal,I'll be hurting Chellamma

2457
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:28,050
Andal will be hurtif I marry Chellamma

2458
02:16:28,090 --> 02:16:31,170
To avoid that, I felt my brideshould be outside family ties

2459
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:34,840
A girl walked into my lifeBoth of us liked each other

2460
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:37,920
I thought it was God's willand informed all of you

2461
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:39,960
But if you sever blood ties?

2462
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:41,630
You decide now

2463
02:16:42,380 --> 02:16:44,380
You want me tomarry Andal, I will

2464
02:16:44,710 --> 02:16:46,460
Or marry Chellamma?

2465
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:48,670
Or both?Whatever you decide

2466
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:50,920
Bigamy is not new to our family

2467
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:53,840
Whatever all of you decideI will comply

2468
02:16:54,750 --> 02:16:56,750
I don't want my family to drift apart

2469
02:16:56,750 --> 02:16:58,710
I don't want to wound any of you

2470
02:17:01,250 --> 02:17:03,840
So many of our men are happymarrying their nieces

2471
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:05,340
Don't worry on that count

2472
02:17:05,880 --> 02:17:07,800
'I don't want to marry my uncle'

2473
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:13,130
I don't like each of your traits separatelyYour smile, speech or attitude

2474
02:17:13,590 --> 02:17:15,300
I love my uncle as an entity

2475
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:18,630
I want you to be my uncletill the end, not my husband

2476
02:17:18,710 --> 02:17:21,710
Considering the fact Andalis a fatherless child...

2477
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:24,550
...we shall unanimously agreeAndal will be his wife

2478
02:17:27,670 --> 02:17:30,750
Do you want to marry me, uncle?

2479
02:17:32,050 --> 02:17:33,420
I'll marry you, dear

2480
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:35,710
Will you be happy?

2481
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:37,710
I'll try my best

2482
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:39,750
I'll make sure you are happy

2483
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:40,920
My dear uncle

2484
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:43,420
Do you know to cry too?

2485
02:17:44,050 --> 02:17:47,300
We have never seen you cry

2486
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:50,920
You are forever bubblybrimming with laughter

2487
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:56,050
We have seen our dear uncleeven act like a clown

2488
02:17:56,800 --> 02:18:00,630
How could we have hurt youlike this and made you cry

2489
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:02,590
'Don't cry, my dear'

2490
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:26,590
He is our wealth

2491
02:18:31,670 --> 02:18:34,170
'I will get him marriedto the girl he loves'

2492
02:18:35,710 --> 02:18:37,920
If anyone dares to oppose this...

2493
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:42,750
'...I won't hesitateto chop them to pieces'

2494
02:19:09,630 --> 02:19:12,630
'Uncle, she wants youto marry her right now'

2495
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:15,590
I came here only becauseshe asked me to come

2496
02:19:16,710 --> 02:19:18,170
My father won't consent

2497
02:19:18,210 --> 02:19:19,300
Don't worry, dear

2498
02:19:19,340 --> 02:19:22,500
My uncles hold a vengeful rage against you

2499
02:19:23,250 --> 02:19:25,670
Sometimes the situation straightens itself

2500
02:19:27,210 --> 02:19:28,710
I shall talk to your father

2501
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:30,000
Be brave, dear

2502
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:46,750
We treated you as our family member

2503
02:19:47,050 --> 02:19:51,210
Kodiyarasu is threateningto kill my family

2504
02:19:52,090 --> 02:19:53,590
I have no choice

All guests, family and friendsplease sit down

2506
02:19:56,210 --> 02:19:58,050

[overlap of angry voices]

2510
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:07,340
'Raghu, what's happening?

2511
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:11,300
Aren't you ashamedof stabbing behind our back?

2512
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:14,380
If you are man enough,stand face to face with my son

2513
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:16,920
- Come on- Coming, bro

2514

We must finish him off today

2515
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:20,500
Ask them to follow us

2516
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:24,300

'Your father asked meif I'm man enough'

'I have come to prove that'

2520
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:45,300
You think only you cankidnap my niece?

2521
02:20:45,550 --> 02:20:47,550
Can't I return that favor?

2522
02:20:48,670 --> 02:20:50,340
You can kidnap only 1 girl

2523
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:52,920
I have kidnapped both your nieces

2524
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:54,130
Not 2, bro

2525
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:55,300
Three

2526
02:20:58,420 --> 02:21:00,340
You didn't spare even the child?

Leave her with meand take all 3 nieces

2528

Hello, my dear nieces

2530
02:21:10,210 --> 02:21:12,300
- Are you scared?- Whaaat?

2531
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:14,840
When our uncle is here,why should we be scared?

2532
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:17,300
My dear uncleFight with all your might

2533
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:20,130
It's ages since we saw you fight

2534
02:21:21,630 --> 02:21:23,340
Hey you drug addict!

2535
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:24,670
Bandana bandit!

2536
02:21:24,710 --> 02:21:26,210
- Both of you come out- Why?

2537
02:21:26,300 --> 02:21:29,630
You have to weigh minimum 50 kgto withstand my wrist-power

2538
02:21:29,670 --> 02:21:31,340
Both of you are underweight

2539
02:21:31,420 --> 02:21:32,420
Come on

2540
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:55,050
Is there a farmer in your midst?

2541
02:21:55,880 --> 02:21:57,590
- Come this side- Why?

2542
02:21:57,630 --> 02:21:59,920
The farmers' livelihoodhas been trampled

2543
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:02,000
Why should I add to your trauma?

2544
02:22:02,050 --> 02:22:04,460
We can't beat upour own clan, that's why

2545
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:09,170
- Hey, where are you going?- Birds of the same feather!

'What is this?'

2570
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:49,200
Will we be reborn withthe same set of relatives?

2571
02:25:49,250 --> 02:25:51,200
Affinity is better than animosity

2572
02:25:51,250 --> 02:25:52,830
Come forward, uncle

2573
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:54,330

Bless Iniyal with a safe deliveryand healthy baby, Lord'

2580
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,840
Father, I have an angel of a daughter

2581
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:25,840
In the form of Goddess Lakshmi

2582
02:26:26,950 --> 02:26:30,830
Our mother gave birth to4 girl babies and finally 1 son

2583
02:26:30,870 --> 02:26:34,580
- Won't he be blessed with a son next?- We went in for family planning

2584
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:36,540
- Why?- Birth control, huh?

2585
02:26:36,580 --> 02:26:37,790
What are you saying?

2586
02:26:37,830 --> 02:26:39,500
Don't you want a son?

2587
02:26:39,580 --> 02:26:41,660
Why differentiatea boy and a girl?

2588
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:44,080
It is how you bring upthe child that counts

2589
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:47,370
Who would want more than this angel?Girls will be in demand now

2590
02:26:47,410 --> 02:26:48,410
Well said!

2591
