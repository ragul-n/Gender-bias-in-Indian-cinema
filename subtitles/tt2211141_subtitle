1
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,505
Hey, brother!
They've come out of the church now

2
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,903
I need to go till Thoppil Padi

3
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,444
Please wait for a while

4
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,946
It's just once a week
that we get to see them so close

5
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:16,606
Whom?

6
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,742
The 'Angels of Rose villa'
Keep watching, they'll come now!

7
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,910
Look, Kabir!

8
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,754
Look!

9
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,711
What is this?
These men will even drink their blood now

10
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,520
Give it to me
Enough of seeing it

11
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,125
Some creatures turn up to watch pictures

12
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,355
These girls look so ravishing!

13
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:10,993
Where is it?
Let me see it too

14
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,804
Kabir, let me see it
Annie's photo is not too clear

15
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,602
She's old now

16
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:22,011
Hmmm..., you should see her earlier pictures,
No man will sleep in his own house

17
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,480
Even now!

18
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:25,808
Don't play the fool

19
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:26,816
Give me back my mobile

20
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,817
Oh no, there's a problem

21
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,150
I'm going to your house now
I'll give it there

22
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:30,813
I'll kill you!

23
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,550
Hey, leave it
Let her go

24
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,023
Don't create a scene

25
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,755
If she files a case,
we'll all be hanged!

26
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,093
It's a problem now
She'll ruin my family

27
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:39,994
Yes, it will be ruined

28
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,506
Oh this is that guy!
It's only now that I saw his face!

29
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,508
What is it, Angel?

30
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,179
This is your brother's

31
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,439
He doesn't come to thejunction
to drive the auto rickshaw

32
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,713
He comes there to click photos
You know that we're having a real tough life

33
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,689
Ask him not to disturb us
He should never click any girl's snaps with this!

34
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,452
Oh, my God!
What have you done, girl?

35
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,688
Don't shout

36
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,397
You, mother and daughter, go check
if your son has kept a camera in the rest room

37
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,033
Isn't there anyone around
to set this girl right?

38
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,444
I'm here!
Please don't move the boat

39
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,037
Please don't move the boat
I need to get in too

40
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,742
Stop screaming
Just come quickly

41
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,376
Yes, I've reached
Please move

42
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,619
Have you decided to get drowned today?

43
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,559
My legs slipped off!

44
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,256
Wonder where such creatures come from

45
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,731
This is the 1st time I'm getting on a boat
There are no boats in my place

46
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,768
Where do you come from?

47
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,894
Rajkumari (princess)

48
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,234
No, I meant to ask you, where you belong to?

49
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,672
That is what I answered
Rajkumari!

50
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,641
Haven't you heard of Kothamangalam,
Nerimangalam?

51
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:03,511
Go east from those places,
Rajkumari city, it's very famous

52
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,414
So, where is the 'king' off to?

53
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,410
I've got a job here at Fort Cochin

54
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,154
At 'Simon Seafoods'
Haven't you heard of it?

55
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,450
Oh Jesus!
There's a ship!

56
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,676
Oh, 'Mother Mary'!
What am I seeing?

57
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,079
See that brother
'Foreigners'

58
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,551
Just keep quiet!
Where have you come from?

59
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,325
There! Foreigners again!
What complexion!

60
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,989
Like the colour of rice fritters!

61
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,327
Hello there!

62
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,163
Just shut up

63
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,661
Have we reached?

64
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,703
I'll let you know when we reach

65
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:03,206
But, till then if you utter one word
I'll drive into the backwaters

66
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,139
You've been shouting from the time you got in

67
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,367
I'm not saying a single word!

68
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,140
I've lost my temper

69
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,793
What is it, Sicily?
Don't curb your laughter

70
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,629
Laugh out loud

71
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,828
Tell me what the joke is,
If it's a good one, I can laugh too

72
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,600
You've been admiring yourself for so long

73
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,870
You don't admire yourself,
So let me at least do it

74
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,205
Do your work, girl

75
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,014
Big brother

76
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,478
Oh, big brother

77
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:56,227
Drinking a lot, is it?
Hey, only women around!

78
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,053
Hello! Who are you?

79
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,162
Me?
I'm Abey

80
00:09:59,265 --> 00:09:59,822
Abey?

81
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,899
The one whom the reverend has sent

82
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,762
Reverend
Which reverend?

83
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,564
Reverend Paulose from Rajkumari,
who spoke to you yesterday

84
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,763
He has sent the letter also with me

85
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,864
Oh I see
Trouble in this form, is it?

86
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,538
Come here

87
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,376
He's my own person
I'll be around here

88
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,211
- We'll meet later
- Hey, come here

89
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,089
I'll give you a tight slap
You, buffalo

90
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,757
Did the Reverend send you here
to embarrass me in front of my employees?

91
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,598
Sit down

92
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,427
You seem so familiar to me
I've heard about you from the Reverend

93
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:39,095
That's the reason I recognised you
Though I'm seeing you forthe 1st time

94
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,942
The reverend has written everything
about me in the letter

95
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,614
You don't look so innocent
Like what the reverend has written

96
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,448
Believe me, I'm a decent guy

97
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,218
Since the reverend has sent you,

98
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,791
...and you've come with all your stuff,
you can stay here

99
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:03,293
It smells so bad over here
How can people stay here?

100
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,624
This is not a company manufacturing perfumes!

101
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,163
I'll stay in your house

102
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,391
Yeah, very nice

103
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,593
Or else, in some lodge

104
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,135
Will someone else come
and pay the rent for you?

105
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:15,399
This place is famous fortourists
So, rooms will be damn expensive

106
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,269
There is a place

107
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:25,007
An old bungalow that I won long ago
The top floor of that house is vacant

108
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,311
You can live there

109
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,682
Yeah, come on like that

110
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,312
I had lit candles for Mother Mary
before I left from home

111
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:36,692
There are 3 ladies living downstairs overthere
They own that house

112
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,161
Oh I see

113
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,494
I'll have someone to talk to
I won't feel bored

114
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,327
You don't have to relieve your boredom that way
You should not go anywhere near them

115
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,607
Once my work is a bit eased out,
I'll come and set things for you

116
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,972
You can just tell me the route
I'll get there

117
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,066
It's a little far away

118
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,008
It's okay
I'll reach there

119
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,374
What's the name of the place?

120
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,845
'Rosevilla'

121
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,253
Isn't that over, Annie?

122
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:16,692
I forgot to ask Angel to get some white thread
We should ask her to buy a mobile phone

123
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,530
We can tell her about things we've forgotten,
when we remember them again

124
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,797
Tell her soon

125
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,364
Then, the ghost of grandma, Helen
will get into her

126
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,073
Guess she's back

127
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,155
Where is Mercy?

128
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,429
Nothing

129
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:55,837
We are neighbours,
But, it's been so long since we spoke in person

130
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,707
Been really busy with busi... ness!!!

131
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,947
Everybody knows what you're business is, Eddy
You've brought one woman here forthat too

132
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:09,544
Oh! Don... na
She's a distant relative of mine

133
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,219
We've been warning you
for quite some time now

134
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:15,089
If we see cars coming there in the nights,
we'll complain to the owner of that house

135
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,321
Please do not betray me
Let me just live on

136
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,454
Is this the only job that you could find?

137
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,692
Not for me
For Donna

138
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:27,262
She's beautiful and healthy too
There are lot of tourists who come for it

139
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,567
She gets the money she demands too
Then what's the issue?

140
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,674
Did you know?
Donna is going to buy a car

141
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,416
You people can buy one too,
if you want to

142
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,586
I'll set things ready for you

143
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,879
Shut up
Get lost

144
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,082
Get out, Eddy
Angel will be here any minute now

145
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:51,494
You can fear her
Even otherwise, she's not your mother right?

146
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,225
Then why do you fear her?
She's the one who's kept you both locked

147
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,860
Hey! What business do you have here?

148
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,905
I just came to place an orderfor a cake

149
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,272
I've told you not to step in here

150
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,277
Eddy uncle...

151
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,710
Forget about Annie

152
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,511
Poor soul, Mercy!
Why does she have to remain like this?

153
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,279
She needs a life too!

154
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,185
Get lost

155
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,654
Dear! Let me...
Get lost I tell you!

156
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:23,251
I don't want to hear anything from you
Get out!

157
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,730
I'll kill you the next time
you step in here

158
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,830
Just listen to me, dear
Come here

159
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:36,132
You wait and watch
One day I'll take out these aunts of yours

160
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,608
Even you, if need be
Mark my words

161
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,738
I'll give you off to foreigners,
who are drugged and drunk!

162
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,816
For free!!!
You devil!

163
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:45,941
You're acting smart with Eddy, is it?

164
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,420
- Angel, NO!
- Ahh! My head!

165
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,820
I've lost my eye

166
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,829
You girl! I'll give you
not only to Foreigners

167
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,321
...but also to Shieks

168
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,576
- This is the house is it?
- Yes

169
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,045
- How much is the meter charge?
- 40

170
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,049
- Oh! That's a bit too much
- That's the rate on the meter

171
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,779
What a meterthat is, brother?
Okay

172
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,382
Come in

173
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,618
Give me the tabla

174
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,959
This is not a tabla,
It's a guitar, brother

175
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,958
One has gone inside
This can'tjust be ignored like this

176
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,696
What are you going to do?

177
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,469
Let them do anything they want
We need not bother

178
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,334
Leave it, Angel
Don't worsen his revenge

179
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,005
Don't worsen his revenge
We never know to what level he can go

180
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,206
Leave me, Mercy

181
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,055
Simon sir

182
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,488
Yes, he told me that
he'll accompany me here

183
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,025
I told him it's okay

184
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,824
Why do we call ourselves 'men',
if we can't locate this address?

185
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,023
That's true

186
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:45,502
I hate to live in a lodge or hostel
I can be on my own if it's a house

187
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:51,137
Did you like me, sister?
I'll be here with you guys for some time

188
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,470
Is it a package?

189
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,478
Yes, can be like that

190
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,276
But, the minute I'm bored,
I'll go back home

191
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:02,218
Between us... finalising the rates

192
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,313
You can consult that with Simon

193
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:10,858
He did not mention about a man being here

194
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,194
I'm an uncle
I just come here sometimes

195
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,995
Okay
Where is my room?

196
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,330
I want to take a shower... freshen up

197
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,531
Hmmm... don't be in a hurry, dear
It's a package, right?

198
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,632
There's lot of time
Small brat

199
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:35,252
Angel, dinner is ready long back
Come

200
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,151
Why are you standing here?

201
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,353
I want to see the cops
arresting that rascal

202
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,290
You come here
We need not bother about all that

203
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:47,354
Get out of here
Please don't throw that, brother

204
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,291
You're making a fool of me?
You don't know who Eddy is

205
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,633
That auto rickshaw guy fooled me,
I came searching for 'Rosevilla'

206
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,569
Your 'Rosevilla'

207
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,003
That's 'Rosevilla'

208
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,540
Stupid game the
auto rickshaw guy played with me

209
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,407
Get lost

210
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:05,882
I'll hit you the next time I see you here...
Not 1, but there are 3 there

211
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,383
Go! Gobble them!

212
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,716
I got into a soup

213
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,053
I told the auto rickshaw guy that,
I wanted to go to 'Rosevilla'

214
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,991
He played the fool with me
I went into the wrong house

215
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,264
Why?
What's the matter?

216
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,456
Why are you here?

217
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,193
I've come to stay here

218
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,399
Simon has sent me here
Hasn't he informed you?

219
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,598
Get out, I say

220
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,368
Where will I go at this hour?

221
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:36,373
Don't throw stones at me
Is this girl out of her mind?

222
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:41,351
Sisters, try to make her understand
I've actually come to stay here!

223
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,152
What's the matter here?
Did you make the phone call?

224
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,026
Sir, this man is creating a scene here

225
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,957
- What's your problem?
- Sir... I'm

226
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,296
- Who are you?
- Rajkumari...

227
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:56,765
Some specimens just decide
to create problems

228
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,768
Take him in

229
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,609
Simon asked me...

230
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,076
...to stay here

231
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,579
He has called them

232
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:18,447
Cakes are ordered for birthdays,
whiskey, beer and food is served,

233
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,313
...people are invited to celebrate

234
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,913
But, when asked to pay for the cakes,
they delay and find faults

235
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,388
Here

236
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,585
What's it, Annie?

237
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,365
- Simon was here
- What for?

238
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:05,390
I'm Abey
From Simon Seafoods!

239
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,931
Simon has sent me...

240
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,331
Remember me?
Last night...

241
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:24,409
You did not introduce yourself
How can you just go off like that?

242
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,077
Please listen,
let me tell you

243
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,556
Is there a problem?

244
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,061
What the hell you are doing here?

245
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,930
With whose permission,
have you allowed him to stay here?

246
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:49,905
Then, what to do?

247
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,637
Should we say 'No' to Simon?
This is his house

248
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,906
Your dad had mortgaged it to him
you know

249
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:03,981
Simon has never come here to ask
for his money, or to shoo us off

250
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,116
That's because he's a gentleman
He knows what we are going through

251
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,389
When he comes and requests us,
how can we deny him?

252
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,999
It's nothing for you
I've to face people outside

253
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,295
It's only in this house,
that I can find some peace

254
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:24,675
I'll never allow anyone to destroy that

255
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,474
I know what to do

256
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,164
Go call the doctor soon

257
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,640
It's because of mental strain

258
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,050
Don't look at me like that
I'll give you one tight slap

259
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,985
I was in the midst of
lot of work in the hospital!

260
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,995
Where is this guy?
Is he there upstairs?

261
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,954
Shall I talk to Simon about it?

262
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,091
No need
I can shoo him out myself

263
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,701
Don't create further problems

264
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:31,675
Consider, there is no such portion in the house
Your haste and immaturity is the problem

265
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:39,215
I've got an important matter to discuss with you
Think properly and let me know

266
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,409
It's for the 3 of you

267
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,751
What's your plan?
Continue living like this?

268
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,253
That's not done

269
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,164
Someone has enquired about Mercy

270
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,703
Tell us who it is

271
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,799
One, Mr. Justin

272
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:12,016
He's a widower
Need not deny it because of that

273
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,484
He's got no kids or other liabilities
from his 1st marriage

274
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:20,224
I know him for several years
He has seen Mercy in the church

275
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:26,195
They have no other demands
We only need Mercy's approval

276
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,509
- Mercy
- Just keep quiet

277
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,084
Will our problems get solved,
if I get married?

278
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:58,293
What if the person is like your dad?

279
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,563
How can everybody be like that?

280
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,893
I know

281
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,632
But if I go off from here,
how will you take care of Annie all alone?

282
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:16,943
It's you who needs a life now
That's all Annie and I dream of!

283
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,882
Your life, yourfuture

284
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:24,422
Yes
Your lives, yourfuture

285
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:29,426
That's all I was bothered about too
Philip's kids are my kids too

286
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,897
It's only because of that love and affection,
I came and told you about this proposal

287
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,161
You people have to decide

288
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,237
Whatever it is,
Don't ruin your lives!

289
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,420
What is it?

290
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,086
Me...
Abey...

291
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,218
From the top floor!
Violin...

292
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,422
It's amazing!
I heard it

293
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,500
I was reading the Bible...

294
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,271
Please do not talk like this, Angel

295
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,344
He's not that sort of a guy
He's innocent

296
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,709
Innocence to a large extreme

297
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:59,215
Yes!
I know him too well

298
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:05,950
I know him too well
Anyway, I'll just talk to him

299
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:11,628
Hey, you've started to botherthem so soon
Isn't it?

300
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,963
- That girl, Angel had just called now
- See, brother

301
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:19,298
It's true that I peeped when I heard the violin
She plays it so beautifully!

302
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,498
You peep into the girls' room at night,
to hear someone play the violin!

303
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,007
You better not go there anymore!
Understood?

304
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,438
I've spoken to the owner of that bar hotel

305
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,846
After a while,
Take that...

306
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,111
- Guitar
- Yes

307
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,379
Go play it to them

308
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,250
If they like it,
job is done

309
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,046
Okay
I'll make this work

310
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,761
Hey!
Get lost!

311
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,036
What is it, you swine
What do you want?

312
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,501
Get lost!

313
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,404
They've come to only create problems

314
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,182
Hey there!

315
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:22,155
Go, get lost!
Brother, did you recognise him?

316
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,954
Who is it?

317
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,962
He's the one who's staying at 'Rosevilla'

318
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,026
Look at the way he's looking at us

319
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:45,977
Mercy!
It's me Henry calling

320
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,778
Come out, you 'piece of shit'

321
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,386
Angel, stop it!

322
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:59,323
Let him stand there and talk anything
You need not go there now

323
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,397
Move away, Annie

324
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,591
If we lose once,
we'll lose forever

325
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,500
Just listen to me
Give me that knife

326
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:12,035
Mercy, I've told you not to let in any man,
otherthan me

327
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,510
Send him out whoever he is
I'll finish him off

328
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:19,174
Oh no,
the devil has come for me

329
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:24,916
Angel, just listen to me
Don't go there

330
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,388
Get lost
Don't create a scene here

331
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,858
You get lost
You can't even withstand a stamp from me

332
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,725
Let him out
Let me see him

333
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,923
What do you want?

334
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,557
You!
I want you!

335
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,761
Will you come with me?

336
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:44,273
Henry, please!
We loved you like our Jones

337
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,344
You need not be grateful for it
But, please do not torture us like this

338
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:51,279
Grateful! Forget it

339
00:30:51,382 --> 00:31:00,222
Her father, Peter beat me like a dog
because I touched Mercy once

340
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,355
Remember one thing

341
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,056
If a guy walks into this 'Rosevilla',
It should only be after I've walked in

342
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,191
Hey, brother
They are coming

343
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:14,402
Don't create problems by standing here
I'm leaving

344
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,503
Time will come
I'll come back

345
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,708
Remember that

346
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,905
What's happening here?

347
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,046
Answer me before you leave

348
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:31,918
It's ourfamily problem

349
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:33,587
Get lost

350
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,192
I'm going
Don't try to scare me

351
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,161
Listen, brother
Don't create a scene here like before

352
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:45,828
I've heard of the stories about you
when the previous sub inspector was here

353
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,634
If I get you in my hands,
I'll break your backbone

354
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,608
Go and sleep

355
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,082
Don't stand out in the fog
Please go in, sisters!

356
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,645
Hey there
What's the problem?

357
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:28,837
Should I interfere?

358
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,911
Oh no!
The devil is coming again!

359
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,932
You've put me into a tiger's cave, brother

360
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:25,196
Even if it smells here, it's okay
I'll stay here, somewhere inside the office

361
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,861
Did Henry do anything to you?

362
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,802
He'll get it from me, if he acts funny

363
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,374
Even yesterday,
I was really irritated by his conversation

364
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,443
But then, I just left it

365
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:36,980
That's good! Otherwise he would have
made you look like a rotten sardine

366
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,847
Henry was a boy from the slums

367
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,545
He was kept as a helper at the bakery
at 'Rosevilla'

368
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:47,613
He grew up there
He misbehaved with Mercy

369
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:51,821
He was shooed out that very day
He's #1 gangster in town now

370
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,362
He doesn't fear even God

371
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,954
Oh no!
Me...

372
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:58,558
You don't worry!
He wouldn't play the fool with you

373
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,967
Henry knows me
You just have to tell him

374
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,001
You need not keep walking anymore
I'll buy you a bike

375
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:07,736
A new one?

376
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:11,008
It's not a brand new one
but it's in a good condition

377
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,810
Do you know how to ride one?

378
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,044
Yes, of course
Father Paul taught me

379
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,916
Ask him about it
I'll fly on it

380
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:38,038
Hey!
What is it?

381
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,503
Don't hit him
Leave him

382
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,840
It's not mine

383
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,881
- Do you know who this is?
- Who is he?

384
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:49,214
He's the one staying at 'Rosevilla'
He's our friend!

385
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,814
- Lift him up
- Aaaaahh... my leg!

386
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:23,314
You're rejoicing my fall, isn't it?
You'll get punished!

387
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,911
Who asked you to come here?

388
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,991
Father Paulose used to tell me that
no matter how high you go

389
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,184
...you'll have to come down for your reward

390
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,389
Can I have something to eat?
Couldn't buy anything because of my fall

391
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,931
I'm in real pain and hunger

392
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,124
There's nothing made here too

393
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,931
Don't talk so heartlessly, Angel

394
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,472
I've only sprained my hand and leg
There is nothing wrong with my nose

395
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,098
I could smell meat gravy from here

396
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,803
Very good!
I don't want to give it to you

397
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,537
Sister!

398
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,876
- Get out of here
- Yes, I'm going

399
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,810
- If I die starving
you'll be taken to jail - Get lost

400
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,151
Who named her Angel, huh?!

401
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,420
Poor soul!
He must be really hungry

402
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,551
Let him be hungry

403
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,891
Why are you so angry with him?

404
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,223
Don't be too sympathetic with him

405
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,699
He'll also misbehave
if he gets an opportunity to

406
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,099
Men!

407
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:17,436
All of them just wait for an opportunity,
to embarrass us

408
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,634
Don't forget that

409
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,777
Just pray that he moves out soon
Don't give him even watertill then

410
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,790
Father Paul used to say that

411
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,053
if someone is coming ready to kill me
he too will only love me before he leaves

412
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,990
Who is this Father Paul?

413
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,656
He's the vicar in my church in Rajkumari

414
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,129
We are good friends

415
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:49,205
Actually my dad is the one who gave half
the money required to build the church there

416
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,670
People respect me because of that

417
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,403
My house is the biggest one in my place

418
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,077
My mom named it
Good one?

419
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,413
I don't have to make money,
by working in the seafood factory

420
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,958
...or by playing the guitar in some hotel

421
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,084
My dad is very rich

422
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,424
But I won't touch his money

423
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,762
It's so satisfying to earn your own money
and live on it, isn't it?

424
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,473
Will Angel walk in now?

425
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,471
I don't want to be the reason
for you to get yelled at

426
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,472
She'll get back late

427
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,676
She's gone to that hospital
to get Annie's medicine

428
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,019
There is nothing wrong with Annie

429
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,680
Just some of hertactics
to be lazing around

430
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,490
No medicine or magic is required
I'll show you right now

431
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,628
No, Abey
Don't touch that

432
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,426
Angel doesn't like anyone touching it

433
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,156
That's her life

434
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,930
It's Rose's violin
Angel's mom's!

435
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,597
Hey, this can't belong to anyone

436
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,674
Can't keep it as one's own property

437
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,766
This belongs to anyone who knows music

438
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:05,305
Father Paul keeps telling me that
there is something called music therapy

439
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:09,182
A magical medicine
that can even save us from death

440
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:15,988
Magic wand forthat magic is the 'violin'
I'm going to heal Aunt Annie now

441
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,590
Let us see

442
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,325
Don't spoil it

443
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:30,720
Sorry to have played on your violin
and for entering this house

444
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:51,363
Oh flowers adorned by dew drops
gently stroked by tender fingers of soft sunlight

445
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:55,935
Swaying gently on waves
and tripping on leaves coming this way

446
00:41:56,247 --> 00:42:01,082
As sweet drops of nectar fill
every flower come to sip them oh little birds

447
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:09,650
Come write out words of wisdom
like drops of dew on blades of grass

448
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,524
Like lines out of poetry

449
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:21,393
Oh flowers adorned by dew drops
gently stroked by tender fingers of soft sunlight

450
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:25,771
Swaying gently on waves
and tripping on leaves coming this way

451
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:57,967
As the wide blue sky watches
as spectator from above

452
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:04,674
Slices of dark thunder clouds
are splashed with colours

453
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:11,911
As waterwavelets softly splashed
around the feet

454
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:19,260
In those rhythms floating
around like a feather

455
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,462
As twilight slowly faded and finally hid

456
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:29,938
Sadness utterly useless

457
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:41,247
As we live this insipid life, come live and
awake to moments of rare happiness with me

458
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:47,222
Oh flowers adorned by dew drops gently
stroked by tender fingers of soft sunlight

459
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:52,227
Swaying gently on waves
and tripping on leaves coming this way

460
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:37,672
Locking up beautiful eyes
with lashes standing guard

461
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:45,181
On pages somewhere unseen by the blue sky

462
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:52,354
On wasted earth as roots go in search

463
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:59,886
Flowers of spring fulfills
with magical chants

464
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:10,503
And as wicks burn bright
dispelling darkness unbidden

465
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:19,072
To bask in the darling lengthening
beams of moonlight lovingly now

466
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,845
Come away with me

467
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,655
Oh flowers adorned by dew drops
gently stroked by tender fingers of soft sunlight

468
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:32,593
Swaying gently on waves
and tripping on leaves coming this way

469
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:37,463
As sweet drops of nectar fill
every flower come to sip them oh little birds

470
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:45,976
Come write out words of wisdom
like drops of dew on blades of grass

471
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,045
Like lines out of poetry

472
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,879
Eat slowly

473
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,616
It's yummy
It's so tasty

474
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,816
- Does he eat here too?
- Who?

475
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,362
Back home
people call him 'little boy'

476
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,830
No one knows him as 'Abey'

477
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,201
Whom do you have at home?

478
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:17,299
Me?
I have got no one

479
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,805
God has been stingy to me that way

480
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:24,013
But, we have someone
whom God has actually sent for us

481
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,275
Forthe people of Rajkumari
Father Paul!

482
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,875
He's the one who brought me up
in the church orphanage

483
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:33,548
But, it's poverty over there too now
I try to help as much as possible

484
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,148
I want to work and help the father
in some way

485
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,751
But what to do!
It's always hell for the poor

486
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,619
Abey will help if you tell him, right?

487
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:45,464
Who?
He himself is an orphan

488
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,342
But, Abey told that
he's from a very rich family

489
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:56,105
He's got a big house called 'Bethlehem'

490
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,779
Oh dear God!
I'll die laughing today

491
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:03,979
Yes, he stays at 'Bethlehem'
But that's not his house

492
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:10,993
It's a home for the aged and orphans
That's where his father is right now

493
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:16,428
They were in Mumbai before
He was a famous musician

494
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:20,765
But what to do?
He was a drug addict

495
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:26,742
Finally his mom left his father and went off

496
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:32,539
He was too small then
Somehow he and his father reached our place

497
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:34,944
They have a house there

498
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,020
But that's been left locked for long
and it's all spoilt now

499
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,680
His father's treatment
required a lot of money

500
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,783
He's come to work in the seafood factory
just to retrieve all that money

501
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:51,632
He won't tell this to anyone
Because he doesn't want anyone to pity him

502
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,029
Abey, you have a guest

503
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,108
Guest?
For me?

504
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,920
Hey! Jose
What's this?

505
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,324
- Chicken
- Not that

506
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,919
How did you reach here?

507
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,123
Yeah, I did

508
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,998
What have you told these sisters?
Your papa...

509
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,536
Not 'Papa'
It's 'Daddy' right

510
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,731
That is how I call him
He's just forgotten everything

511
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,534
Daddy?
What is it?

512
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:31,869
Come on!

513
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,567
Hey, wait!
Let me tell you

514
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,373
You've lost weight and lost colour
What happened?

515
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,040
Why are you pushing me like this?

516
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,582
Who asked you to come here now?

517
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:44,450
Simon had called Father day before yesterday
asking him to send someone here

518
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:47,421
- What for?
- Donation for Bethlehem is ready

519
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:52,018
- So, I was sent to get that
Thought I can see you as well - Come here

520
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,825
What stories have you told them?

521
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,366
Keep quiet
I'll kill you

522
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,228
Have you told them anything?

523
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,429
I know you too well
Will I tell them?

524
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,233
You can continue to live in style

525
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:08,137
Hey, so many foreigners around!
All wearing shorts

526
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:11,476
I was really taken aback
I want to see around the place

527
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:14,812
If possible I want to go back
with a foreigner

528
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,216
Oh God
You dirty creature

529
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:20,119
A chicken leg
This is too much!

530
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:02,988
Hey, look at him
He's too much

531
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,467
You're spoiling your life
by body building and speaking dialogs

532
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,733
Guys are enjoying in 'Rosevilla'

533
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:38,693
Oh God!
What are you doing?

534
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,292
We would've died falling down now

535
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,771
Have you told your people that
you'll return back safe?

536
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,403
Oh God! Let's not stand here

537
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,505
They are problem makers
Shows on their faces

538
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,508
Abey, isn't it?

539
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,857
Leave
Leave today itself!

540
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:03,983
From Rosevilla
That's my playground

541
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:08,253
Don't play overthere
I don't like it

542
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:09,789
Understood?

543
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:13,469
What if I don't?

544
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:18,804
Who are you to tell me to leave?
Simon has to tell...

545
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:25,471
What are you doing?
Don't hit him!

546
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,072
Leave him
Don't hit him

547
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:33,487
What are you doing?

548
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,421
Enough!
He'll die

549
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,431
Leave him!

550
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,226
Save your life

551
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:50,238
Go back home
You swine!

552
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,054
You need not get worried seeing all this

553
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:17,794
I'm used to all this
But I don't get to eat apples like this

554
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,402
Take rest
I'll inform Simon uncle

555
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,404
Then he'll react

556
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,906
The first blow was
when he mentioned that man's name

557
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,941
Let me know if you need something
I'll be there downstairs

558
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,880
I'm thinking I'll move out from here
Why create problems unnecessarily?

559
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,159
Are you scared?

560
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,354
No
I don't want to create problems for you

561
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:50,095
You moving out will not solve
any of your problems

562
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:56,736
If you move out now
it's victory for Henry

563
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,517
Do you know how
Jesus was put on the cross?

564
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:20,193
She meant to say that
you'll be put on a cross like that

565
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:25,200
Why do we have to come here
to get hit by some gangster?

566
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,096
It's just dialogs for her

567
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:32,232
It's we who'll get hit
You should move out from here soon

568
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:33,535
No

569
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:38,012
Angel and her aunts should not
lose in front of anyone

570
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:41,148
What are you planning?

571
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,017
It's love!

572
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:55,692
He's beginning to fall in love with Angel

573
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:01,735
As you thought
it isn't like that

574
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:08,140
I don't know whether it's love,
respect or reverence

575
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:12,607
But, when she comes near me,
smiles at me, talks to me

576
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,206
...I feel something!!!

577
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:19,619
That's the feeling of love
God gives signals like that to love each other

578
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,020
Divine Love

579
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:24,355
She should not know
that I feel this for her

580
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:29,094
If she does, she'll think that I'm just like
all other men

581
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,133
I don't want to lose the love and freedom
I have in that house

582
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,204
Oh! Damn it
I'm angry

583
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:41,834
You don't have to get angry again

584
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,779
Even if you do
don't show it on this bottle

585
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,919
Abey, dear
Do you know why I'm still single?

586
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:56,253
That's because you didn't find a girl

587
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,122
- Who? Me?
- Yes, who else?

588
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,786
What do you know?

589
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:04,564
There was a time when, fathers and brothers
of all the eligible girls in Cochin

590
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,364
...were making a bee line to my house

591
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,634
Oh! Your house is a liquor shop or what,
for people to queue outside since morning?

592
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:12,969
Get lost! You piece of grass!

593
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:19,212
Abey, you should never lose your love

594
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,615
That will be a loss
that you can never get back later

595
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:28,282
Angel is a good girl
She's gone through lot of hardship in life

596
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:30,882
What happened in Rosevilla?

597
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,325
That's another story

598
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,065
Problems started after
Peter got married to Rose

599
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:42,133
First Judeson, Annie's and Mercy's brother
left home fighting with Peter!

600
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,600
Then, theirfather, Philip passed away

601
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:50,713
Afterthat, Rosevilla was ruled by Peter
He was a drunkard and fraud

602
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:55,982
The day that incident happened
was Angel's 8th birthday

603
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:19,173
You too disturb me like your mother

604
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,591
Can't you answer me when I'm calling?

605
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,469
Enough of drinking
We are celebrating Angel's birthday today

606
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:53,201
Guests will be coming now
Please do not insult us

607
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:58,042
I know it's Angel's birthday

608
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:02,312
But I'm celebrating
for something even better

609
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,078
Mercy's marriage is fixed

610
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:46,090
Mercy, I'll never give you away to anyone

611
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:58,966
Peter, what are you doing?

612
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:06,022
Do you know that my birthday is also
the day my mom killed my dad?

613
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,096
The day I became an orphan!

614
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:19,732
I co- operated with everything today
just to keep my aunts, Annie and Mercy happy

615
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:28,445
That day my mom had gifted me a violin
That was my mom's last gift for me

616
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,109
Just like what you did today

617
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,725
My mom suffered from
mental disorder in jail

618
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:39,727
She killed herself
by deliberately hitting her head somewhere

619
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:50,901
I couldn't even cry when I heard about it
Those pending cries is my music

620
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,608
People whom we've loved have only hurt us

621
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:05,280
Fear of accusations,
people around, everybody!

622
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:09,484
What are you thinking of?
This mood doesn't suit you one bit

623
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:11,219
Where is all the boldness?

624
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,692
Bold?
I'm not bold

625
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:21,730
That's the state of mind created
by all the sadness in me

626
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:23,736
That's true!

627
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:29,176
People who have lot of worries,
do not confide in people, I'm like that too!

628
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,640
Father Paul keeps telling me that

629
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:37,915
I laugh, make others laugh,
talk big about myself and fool myself

630
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:45,852
If we think of the past and be sad
we'll only have sadness in future too

631
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,793
Father says this too

632
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,031
Don't you have anything
to say for yourself?

633
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,623
What is there to say?

634
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:55,101
There is lots I want to talk
but I'm not able to

635
01:02:55,805 --> 01:03:00,105
One thing is true, I swear

636
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:04,942
Hereafter, whether happiness or sadness,
I'm there to share it with you

637
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:06,480
...if you let me

638
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:19,228
Angel, you didn't say anything

639
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:22,154
See
See how happy she is

640
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:33,701
So many birthdays have gone past
we've not gifted anything to ourAngel, isn't it?

641
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,172
We should

642
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:44,004
We'll make her a dress for Christmas this year
Something that nobody's seen before

643
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:53,655
When she's wearing that for Christmas dinner
we should make Abey stand next to her

644
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:59,120
Our Christmas gift
Shouldn't we?

645
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,709
Mercy, he's coming
Ask him

646
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:32,027
Abey, I want to go to Ernakulam
to get material for a dress

647
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,221
I'll get it if you give me your list

648
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,231
You fool
I've to go select it in person

649
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:40,427
I'll get delayed
if I go by the bus or boat

650
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:43,437
I need to get back before Angel gets back
from her violin class

651
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,632
Why are you hiding it from Angel?
Is it a surprise?

652
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,203
How will you go?
Shall I get a helicopter?

653
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,072
Shall we go on this bike?

654
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:54,148
Oh! That's the reason
you are being so nice!

655
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,117
Go ask Simon for half a day leave today

656
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,915
Should I go, Aunt Annie?

657
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,716
- Yes, you should
- Okay! Get ready

658
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,553
- Not coming in?
- No, I'm not

659
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,023
Load is expected today
So Simon will be searching for me

660
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:39,890
Where are you both coming from?

661
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,162
Broad daylight
so, people won't suspect is it?

662
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:48,235
My dear boy
don't give me too much of work

663
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:49,429
This...

664
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:52,573
Talking nonsense, you rascal!
I'll kill you!

665
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:56,736
Leave me

666
01:06:56,979 --> 01:07:00,176
If you hit me again
I'll slap you and break your ears

667
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:04,912
Mercy, why do you want to travel on this
in the hot sun?

668
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,989
I'll arrange a
Mercedes Benz for you, my dear

669
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,126
I'll kill you!

670
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:17,325
You sold her somewhere

671
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:37,748
You took care of them like a treasure,
all these years See for yourself now!

672
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:41,345
She's gone out with him,
when you were not around!

673
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:44,824
Ask them where they both were

674
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:49,762
So, now people around know
about the ladies of Rosevilla!

675
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:53,963
Don't create a scene here anymore

676
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,867
Go in

677
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,777
Go in, I say!

678
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,926
Seen enough, right?
GO

679
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,073
It's because Aunt Mercy told me...
Angel...

680
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:33,005
Please
Listen to me!

681
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,576
What is it?
Are you crying?

682
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,910
No... me

683
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:30,452
I've told you men should not cry like this

684
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,452
God is gracious!

685
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,988
Your wish will be fulfilled
your dad will start walking again

686
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,251
Come, let me talk to you

687
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:43,124
Haven't I told you about music therapy?

688
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:46,998
Shall we stop allopathy
and try that on him?

689
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:50,071
Dr. George Thomas has
also suggested the same

690
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:54,203
Music within Antony has not faded away

691
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,473
That's the reason he responds
when you play the guitar

692
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:02,815
Music is 'God's gift'
'Music Therapy' is a miracle

693
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:08,823
Where God Himself can come and heal
let God, Himself come here, isn't it!

694
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:17,226
What's gone wrong with you?
A lifeless smile on your face

695
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,891
Nothing at all, Father

696
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:20,624
Don't tell me it's nothing

697
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:24,502
Jose updated me on the events in Cochin

698
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:32,436
Don't play hide and seek with me
I can find out for sure when you are upset

699
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:34,448
So, how far have things progressed?

700
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:46,654
God, I just hope it's a shepherd (Samaritan)
Who has come to give some donation

701
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:57,468
Looks like your dad
and I have got a new friend

702
01:12:57,573 --> 01:13:01,566
Let me go see, or else, they'll leave
that poor soul in the courtyard itself

703
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,205
Meet me before you leave

704
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:08,613
The piano in the chapel
has something wrong with the tones

705
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,207
You have to check it out

706
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,621
Papa, did you hear what
Father Paul just told?

707
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:23,426
You'll be healed soon
Then we can go back to our house

708
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:28,236
You... here... alone
I don't want that

709
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,311
Don't stare and scare me

710
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:59,593
Aunts, Annie and Mercy told you
what happened that day...

711
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:02,721
- Where were you?
- With my dad

712
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,731
You could have told us and left, isn't it?

713
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,564
What for?

714
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:11,502
You just shooed me off
without even enquiring what the matter was

715
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:15,176
What else do you expect me to do
in that situation? Tell me

716
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,276
I've told you
everything about me, right?

717
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:25,479
You told me that you'll be with me in joy
and sorrow! And now what?

718
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:30,221
Do you know, how tensed I was
because you weren't around?

719
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:31,292
Angel

720
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:33,361
Don't call me

721
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,732
Don't get angry, Angel

722
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:41,663
When you were not around
not near me

723
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:44,330
I...
My...

724
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,834
Can't hold it back anymore

725
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:55,379
I can't live without you

726
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:41,290
All what I ever wished for
I shall gently sing to you, encore

727
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:50,236
All what I ever wished for
I shall gently sing to you, encore

728
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:54,571
A tune that can be heard by you alone

729
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:12,917
All the wishes you wished and more
to wrap close around my heart

730
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:21,993
All the wishes you wished and more
to wrap close around my heart

731
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:26,336
Like a tune never heard
before till this day

732
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:58,001
As we sleep sweet dreams of the early morn
in one amongst those islands of stars

733
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:02,736
We met each other for the first time today

734
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:05,039
As we slipped and slid along
with the flowery breeze

735
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:07,047
Wrapped in a blanket of slumber

736
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:11,779
Let's journey together

737
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:16,517
In search those lonely shores of love

738
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,420
As the fine strikes of lightning
melted gold

739
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:52,425
And the lovely moonbeams
adorned as gem stones

740
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:57,089
Turned into the ring we exchanged

741
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,360
As all the seven colours of the rainbow

742
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:01,459
We strummed with our fingers

743
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:06,200
And turned into lilting notes of music

744
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:10,506
As we sing the endless song of love

745
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:28,986
All what I ever wished for
I shall gently sing to you, encore

746
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:37,971
All the wishes you wished and more
to wrap close around my heart

747
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:42,305
Like a tune never heard
before till this day

748
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,335
Oh no! All wearing small shorts
It's a sexy sight!!

749
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:09,598
What complexion all 3 of them have

750
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:11,797
Shall I also come along with you?

751
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:14,341
It's okay
if you're not interested

752
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:20,447
Hi! Looks like she'll fall for me
Coming with me... to Rajkumari?

753
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,141
Is this a guy or a girl?

754
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:27,680
Oh no!
My travel expenses haven't gone wasted

755
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:33,288
Walking with her husband

756
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:37,023
- Lucky man!
- What is it?

757
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:38,690
Oh God!
My time has come!

758
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,166
Please do not kill me
I'll go back

759
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:43,764
Whom are you searching for?

760
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,773
Been watching you walk around like a dracula
in search of blood

761
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,968
- My cousin
- What?

762
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:50,874
She's a nurse in London

763
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:53,209
I was just wondering if there's someone
around here who knows her

764
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,508
Swear on God

765
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,379
You're a clever brat

766
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,712
Get on the bike
Get on, I say

767
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,044
Okay, I did

768
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,319
Lost all the thrill I had
drooling over those foreigners

769
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:11,661
Oh! Jose!
Come in

770
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,734
Why are you like this?

771
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:24,707
Mercy, don't worry
I've not come to pick up a fight

772
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,944
Fear?
Why should I fear you?

773
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,210
Came to see a friend of mine

774
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,084
- Which friend?
- Abey

775
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:39,024
We meet at the hotel everyday
What music he plays

776
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:40,355
I'll fall for it
(I fell for it)

777
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:42,761
Aunt Mercy

778
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,903
Yourfriend has come to see you

779
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,043
Mother Mary

780
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:08,454
Come down here, my friend
Are you dancing?

781
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:09,918
Just come here...

782
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,663
When did you come, Jose?

783
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:20,066
Just... now, Abey

784
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,469
Don't you know this friend?

785
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:28,574
Know me? Tell her
that we are the best of friends

786
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:33,406
Hereafter, you can meet
yourfriends outside

787
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,750
She deserves a tight slap

788
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,019
I'm leaving, you pork

789
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:44,417
Let me take leave, my friend

790
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:52,623
- When did you befriend him?
- What friend?

791
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:54,827
Then why did you come on his bike?

792
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:57,166
If someone holds a knife to your neck
asking you to get on it

793
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:59,240
...one might even climb a coconut tree
if asked to!

794
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:02,274
I was scared
Luckily, Angel did not lose her cool

795
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,845
She would've hit him with the violin
if she had it in her hands

796
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,247
What's your plan, Jose?

797
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:09,180
- It's Christmas season
- So what?

798
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:11,650
I've heard that lot of foreigners
come to Cochin for Christmas

799
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:14,586
Last time
I couldn't see them properly

800
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:18,386
I've borrowed money
from Kurian's shop to come here

801
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:19,721
You corpse!

802
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:22,121
These foreigners are not your sisters, right?

803
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:24,198
Only Indians are our brothers and sisters!

804
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:26,199
I've also studied in a school

805
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:29,202
I'll live it up, this Christmas

806
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,169
- How's it?
- Very nice

807
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,203
Aunt Annie...

808
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:40,674
She'll come here now

809
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:42,545
You go there
I'll just come too

810
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,416
Where are you both hiding?
Where's Aunt Annie?

811
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,684
- What is the matter?
- There is something

812
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,692
Come here
Aunt Annie

813
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:54,227
Come

814
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:56,224
Where are you taking us?

815
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:58,159
There is something
I'll show you

816
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:01,160
Look at this

817
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:05,936
How's it?
This is the Rajkumari style

818
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:12,704
This is all Abey's plan
I never expected it to look so beautiful

819
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:14,372
He's nice, isn't it, aunt Mercy?

820
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:18,379
What about me?
Am I here to pick grass?

821
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,096
Abey, are you leaving now?

822
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,101
Angel's not back yet?

823
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:39,571
She has to deliver the cakes
that have been ordered

824
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,842
- She'll be late
- Shall I leave now?

825
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:44,468
We thought you'll be here
with us for Christmas

826
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,547
I'll be back soon, Aunt Mercy

827
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:48,275
Just that I want to spend
some time with my dad

828
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,817
I'll be back as soon as Christmas is over
Sure

829
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:55,288
There will be a surprise for you
when you get back here

830
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:59,026
Our Christmas gift for you
You should accept it happily

831
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:00,617
Hey, come soon

832
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,296
Let me leave for now

833
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,876
See, they are coming
Can't bear to watch them like this

834
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,912
Hey, look Madhoos!

835
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:19,843
Madhoos??

836
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,849
Yes, foreign women
Why call them that?

837
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:27,854
I'm going to call them 'Madhoos'
Look at them, my dear!!!

838
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,253
Can you just keep quiet?

839
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:35,261
Why are you pissed off with me if you couldn't
bid farewell to Angel before you left?

840
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:39,823
I don't think she's got the love and affection
that you have for her

841
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:41,697
Or else, she would've come before we left

842
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,169
Don't simply sit and blabber nonsense

843
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:46,297
You heard Aunt Annie saying that
she'd gone to deliver X'mas cakes

844
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:47,499
Listen to this if you want to

845
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:50,442
When people are in love
they even forget their own mothers

846
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:52,479
Then, how can
delivering cakes be priority?

847
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:56,346
Don't sit here and stagnate
The boat will leave now

848
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:00,353
Hey, look there, my dear!

849
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:17,197
Thought you must have left
I forgot something

850
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,402
Cake isn't it?
Father Paul loves cakes

851
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:24,007
Sorry, this is for Abey's dad

852
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:25,977
No luck for Father Paul
to eat a cake

853
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,105
Keep it
At least, let your dad have it

854
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:31,982
- This is for you, Jose
- Oh! What luck for Father Paul

855
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,318
Come, the boat is leaving

856
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:37,050
Angel, I'm leaving
See you next time

857
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:42,561
- Merry X'mas
- Thank you

858
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:45,696
Shall I leave now?

859
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:48,031
Come soon

860
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:43,118
Do you know who sent this for you?

861
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:50,496
Angel
You will like her a lot

862
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:56,500
Shall I ask her if she'll join us?
She will agree, right?

863
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:57,571
She will agree!!

864
01:27:57,672 --> 01:28:00,300
Then we'll bring all of them here
to our house

865
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:08,538
You, me, Angel, aunts Annie and Mercy
We can all live happily together

866
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:12,950
Where there is music all the time
It will be fun, isn't it?

867
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:15,755
What is this?

868
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:19,258
You are sharing yourAngel's love
only with your dad?

869
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,658
We are here too

870
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:25,724
Angel had sent your cake with him
Didn't you give it to Father?

871
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:28,461
C... c... c... cake?
Which cake?

872
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:31,197
Not c... c... cake!
Xmas cake

873
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,672
From when did you start stammering?

874
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,538
Tell me the truth
Where is the cake?

875
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:40,637
Oh! That cake!
It fell from my hand into the backwaters

876
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:42,511
He just forgot about it
I'm telling you the truth

877
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:46,178
It went into the backwaters
below your head, isn't it?

878
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:48,949
You, liar!

879
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:52,887
Yes, how long can I resist my temptation,
when I'm carrying such a delicious cake?

880
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,154
I just ate that cake

881
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:55,092
Go file a case against me
if you want to

882
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:57,164
When it comes to food,
this Father always has to find fault

883
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:59,756
Oh God! When will there be an end
to his temptation for food?

884
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:00,629
Give this cake to everyone, Father

885
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:02,225
You go and give it yourself

886
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:04,496
Give it to me
I'll give it to everyone

887
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:07,267
You want to push this too
into your backwaters, isn't it?

888
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:10,203
Give it to Father

889
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:12,609
His stomach is not like the backwaters
it's like a sea

890
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:14,272
Arabian sea!
Let him eat

891
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:16,475
Hey!
Mother Mary!

892
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:23,049
Shall I tell him our good news?

893
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:24,055
What is it, Father?

894
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:28,595
That team had come here
I told you about the music therapy

895
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:33,065
- And then?
- They were shocked to see your dad

896
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:42,269
Their perception about your dad
is much higher than what you and I know!

897
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:46,708
Your dad is a magician

898
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:50,716
...who has mesmerised a whole generation
with his music

899
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,416
Dad

900
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,158
God is with us, dear

901
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:12,035
For people like Antony who have music in them
can be healed sooner with this therapy

902
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:23,649
They will come here after New Year
I'm confident that your dad will walk

903
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:36,460
Why such a smile?

904
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:39,598
What's happened to the 2 of you?

905
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:42,733
Merry X'mas

906
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:43,599
What is that?

907
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:46,002
Our X'mas gift

908
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:03,487
We will call you when Abey comes here
You must wear this and come out

909
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:04,008
Aunt Annie

910
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:07,619
Call the doctor soon

911
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,295
Line is not going through

912
01:32:16,397 --> 01:32:17,694
Go and get a taxi soon

913
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:35,443
Oh, no
Can't go this way, sir

914
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:36,778
- Shall we go the other way?
- No

915
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,250
This is fun
I'll just come now, okay

916
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:59,669
Hey!
Move away

917
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:02,834
Get lost
Dancing in the middle of the road

918
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:03,842
Corpses!

919
01:33:57,698 --> 01:33:58,722
Aunt Annie?

920
01:34:06,073 --> 01:34:08,166
Is it a surprise?

921
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:11,567
I've got back

922
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:14,474
Aunt Annie

923
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:17,675
Aunt Mercy

924
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:24,956
No more surprises
I've come back

925
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:28,828
Aunt Annie

926
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,161
Aunt Mercy

927
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,331
I will find you

928
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:01,525
It's a real surprise, isn't it?

929
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:04,923
Aunt Annie, I'm really hungry
Come soon

930
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:06,466
Aunt Annie

931
01:35:30,324 --> 01:35:33,885
What is this?
Who is it?

932
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:35,751
Tell me!
Who?

933
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:17,429
Abey, she thought to give you surprise
But see, how her condition is now?

934
01:36:22,476 --> 01:36:23,841
Why are you like this?

935
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,072
Where is Aunt Mercy?

936
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:29,341
Aunt Mercy...

937
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:33,676
Tell them not to take her
Tell them not to take my Mercy away

938
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:38,343
My Mercy!

939
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:00,996
That's him, sir

940
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,834
Get into the car

941
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:45,144
I don't know anything, brother

942
01:39:04,638 --> 01:39:06,936
Hey, there

943
01:39:08,309 --> 01:39:09,469
Hey
'Sir' is calling you

944
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:10,474
Come out

945
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,174
Sir, he's innocent

946
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:20,845
It's not enough if you say it
We should be convinced too

947
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:25,091
That is why he's been brought here
Let us enquire and find out

948
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:26,625
We'll conclude afterthat

949
01:39:26,727 --> 01:39:31,892
You can leave for now, Simon
We'll inform you after we enquire

950
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:42,364
Brother!

951
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:57,447
He did not speak a word
So, I had to whack him once

952
01:39:57,558 --> 01:40:00,857
He is not a thing
You can leave now

953
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:04,259
Little brother
Tell me what happened

954
01:40:04,365 --> 01:40:05,855
Tell me the truth

955
01:40:05,966 --> 01:40:08,526
I've not done anything, sir!

956
01:40:09,036 --> 01:40:11,869
Or else I wouldn't know anything

957
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:19,010
You went home for Christmas
So, when did you get back?

958
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:20,239
I came by the last boat

959
01:40:20,347 --> 01:40:26,081
Why?
Whom do you have back home?

960
01:40:26,453 --> 01:40:28,614
Only my dad

961
01:40:29,656 --> 01:40:34,889
What was the reason foryou to hurry back
instead ofcelebrating Christmas with yourdad?

962
01:40:35,329 --> 01:40:36,421
Me...

963
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:37,895
Tell me brother

964
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:39,563
I was asked to come

965
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:41,566
- By whom?
- Aunt Mercy

966
01:40:43,137 --> 01:40:51,044
You referto her with so much of respect
how could you rape and kill her?

967
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:52,811
Very bad!

968
01:40:53,113 --> 01:40:56,776
I didn't do it, sir
I will never do it, sir

969
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:59,450
She was like a motherto me

970
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:07,049
It's not me, sir
Not me

971
01:41:12,099 --> 01:41:15,933
It's him for sure
I saw it with my eyes

972
01:41:16,036 --> 01:41:19,335
Donna saw it too
You don't know him

973
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,203
The very day he landed here

974
01:41:21,308 --> 01:41:23,799
...he came to my house
and tried to get Donna

975
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:28,405
He wasn't sure of whether
he wanted Angel or her aunt

976
01:41:28,515 --> 01:41:31,143
That's what I've heard
Anyway, lucky guy!

977
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:34,482
I need to go meet someone at the palace

978
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:37,955
Come here

979
01:41:38,058 --> 01:41:39,548
Please do not do anything to me, sir

980
01:41:42,262 --> 01:41:45,629
Then what?
Tell me

981
01:41:45,732 --> 01:41:49,168
I told you, sir
That boy is not a nice guy

982
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:50,232
You know what?

983
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:55,240
Some time back, this lady, Mercy, who died
was seen with this guy on his bike

984
01:41:55,342 --> 01:41:59,745
On their way back from Ernakulam
after some sleazy affair

985
01:41:59,847 --> 01:42:02,645
I asked him about it
Shouldn't I ask him?

986
01:42:02,883 --> 01:42:04,976
After all, we are neighbours

987
01:42:05,152 --> 01:42:08,918
As soon as I asked him about it
he got furious

988
01:42:09,022 --> 01:42:11,923
He hit me terribly

989
01:42:12,893 --> 01:42:16,989
Of late, there has been something fishy
going on there

990
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:21,190
If we go ask ortry to find out
we get labelled as 'criminals' ourselves

991
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:25,397
Why create problems unnecessarily?
Gentlemen should also survive, right?

992
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:26,803
Yes, of course!

993
01:42:41,121 --> 01:42:46,024
So, what time did you see
Abey walk into Rosevilla?

994
01:42:46,126 --> 01:42:47,024
8:00 P. M

995
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:52,030
What about you?
Can't you hear me?

996
01:42:56,803 --> 01:42:59,772
Eddy, why is she lying?

997
01:42:59,873 --> 01:43:03,104
You said 8:00 P. M
She says 9:30 P. M

998
01:43:03,644 --> 01:43:08,104
Or is it you, who is lying?
Who is correct?

999
01:43:08,215 --> 01:43:13,448
After 8, it's 8:30, isn't it?
After 8:30, it's 9

1000
01:43:13,554 --> 01:43:15,454
After 9, it's obviously 9:30

1001
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:18,787
Yes, of course!
Then 10, 10:30,

1002
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:22,851
- So, you saw someone in Rosevilla at 8?
- Who was that?

1003
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:24,863
To tell you the truth
I've not seen anyone

1004
01:43:26,099 --> 01:43:28,260
Playing the fool
in spite of having been caught

1005
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:31,132
Tell me the truth
Stop crying

1006
01:43:31,238 --> 01:43:35,902
Tell me the truth
Or else, I'll kill you

1007
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:41,875
Playing the pimp and destroying a family
of respectable ladies, you dog!

1008
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:46,880
Donna told me who went to Rosevilla

1009
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:49,222
I'll write his horoscope for him

1010
01:43:49,323 --> 01:43:50,290
Henry's!

1011
01:43:55,929 --> 01:43:56,896
Stop it

1012
01:46:27,781 --> 01:46:36,018
Fluttering wings disappearing
into the distance like birds in flight

1013
01:46:36,123 --> 01:46:47,660
Loneliness still remained within me
in the fading hours of daylight

1014
01:46:47,768 --> 01:46:56,198
While violin strings awoke my senses

1015
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:26,766
Memories interwoven with forgetfulness

1016
01:47:26,873 --> 01:47:35,303
Playing between light and shade
through the window bloom and fade

1017
01:47:35,749 --> 01:47:46,853
Silence like a broken
puppet slept beside me

1018
01:47:46,960 --> 01:48:01,307
Somewhere as leaves were laden with the
tear drops of the winter night falling softly

1019
01:48:04,077 --> 01:48:12,075
Fluttering wings disappearing
into the distance like birds in flight

1020
01:48:12,185 --> 01:48:23,756
Loneliness still remained within me
in the fading hours of daylight

1021
01:48:23,864 --> 01:48:35,674
While violin strings awoke my senses

1022
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:56,895
Abey, I'm scared
when I think of Angel

1023
01:48:58,064 --> 01:49:01,625
If something happens to me
she should not be left alone

1024
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:11,776
We lived for her and she for us

1025
01:49:12,679 --> 01:49:18,675
But now, there is no one trustworthy
to give entrust herto

1026
01:49:23,256 --> 01:49:28,193
The person who realised that
you both love each other very much

1027
01:49:28,295 --> 01:49:31,321
...without conveying it to each other
was Mercy!

1028
01:49:34,768 --> 01:49:39,728
This is the Christmas gift that
we had treasured for you

1029
01:49:39,839 --> 01:49:40,806
It's... Angel!

1030
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:52,508
She has gone through a lot in life
Should not be that way anymore

1031
01:49:55,655 --> 01:49:59,147
I'm giving herto you
wholeheartedly!

1032
01:50:14,808 --> 01:50:23,944
Abey, don't go forthat hotel job anymore
Henry's people are all over there

1033
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:27,042
I'm scared, Abey

1034
01:50:27,754 --> 01:50:29,051
What is this?

1035
01:50:29,155 --> 01:50:31,248
What mistake have we done
to fear him like this?

1036
01:50:33,226 --> 01:50:35,126
I safeguarded her all these years

1037
01:50:35,228 --> 01:50:37,526
But it took me only a minute
to lose Aunt Mercy

1038
01:50:38,098 --> 01:50:40,658
Don't worry
Nothing will happen to us

1039
01:50:40,767 --> 01:50:42,735
We should not lose anything hereafter

1040
01:50:42,902 --> 01:50:45,803
Don't talk unnecessarily
and upset Aunt Annie too

1041
01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:47,068
Let me go

1042
01:51:50,236 --> 01:51:51,464
I'm Eddy

1043
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:55,131
Damn it
You would've got hit now

1044
01:51:56,643 --> 01:51:58,270
Why are you so late?

1045
01:51:58,378 --> 01:52:00,676
I have to reach here in hiding, isn't it?

1046
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:10,148
That stupid sub- inspector is all determined
to arrest you no matter what

1047
01:52:10,256 --> 01:52:12,087
He's too dangerous

1048
01:52:12,192 --> 01:52:14,160
If he arrests you
he'll arrest me too

1049
01:52:15,195 --> 01:52:22,692
Brother, Donna has left
My income is down the drain

1050
01:52:27,273 --> 01:52:31,642
Brother, can you try going to Rosevilla
once again?

1051
01:52:32,078 --> 01:52:34,706
Things are easier now

1052
01:52:34,881 --> 01:52:39,045
It's only Mercy who's dead
Angel is still there

1053
01:52:39,352 --> 01:52:42,844
You just take her like a little bird
and give herto me

1054
01:52:43,223 --> 01:52:45,123
I'll live my life with that

1055
01:52:47,093 --> 01:52:49,721
You corpse!
What did you think of me?

1056
01:52:49,829 --> 01:52:53,856
You mixed cannabis in my liquor,
and made me do it

1057
01:52:54,634 --> 01:52:57,330
I loved Mercy!

1058
01:52:58,104 --> 01:53:00,800
I've still not gotten over
the pain in my heart

1059
01:53:02,509 --> 01:53:03,737
Brother... that...

1060
01:53:03,843 --> 01:53:06,368
I'll slaughter you
Get lost

1061
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:07,673
You corpse!

1062
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:22,690
Tell me brother
What's up?

1063
01:53:24,597 --> 01:53:27,498
I told you
I'm leaving this scene

1064
01:53:27,667 --> 01:53:29,897
Just listen to what I've got to tell you

1065
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:35,234
I have to abscond
No, that's risky

1066
01:53:35,542 --> 01:53:37,271
Just send me a boat

1067
01:53:41,214 --> 01:53:45,913
Who is that, pig?
Come out in the light

1068
01:53:46,019 --> 01:53:48,249
Come if you are that bold

1069
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:49,720
Leave me!

1070
01:53:54,027 --> 01:53:57,519
Who is that?
Come here, you swine

1071
01:53:57,630 --> 01:53:59,928
Come face me
Come

1072
01:54:07,574 --> 01:54:09,974
No!

1073
01:54:30,663 --> 01:54:31,960
Where were you till now?

1074
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:33,958
What is it?

1075
01:54:35,268 --> 01:54:36,758
What happened?
Abey!

1076
01:54:40,707 --> 01:54:42,538
Don't make a noise
Aunt Annie is inside

1077
01:54:42,642 --> 01:54:45,008
I saw him
Henry

1078
01:54:52,018 --> 01:54:53,110
Is he dead?

1079
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:55,180
I don't know

1080
01:54:58,091 --> 01:55:00,787
Abey, why are you like this?

1081
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:04,860
It's for our Aunt Mercy
This is the least I can do

1082
01:55:05,231 --> 01:55:14,230
I can't lose... you... I'm scared

1083
01:55:17,477 --> 01:55:21,937
We should live
Should live for many many years

1084
01:55:23,516 --> 01:55:24,813
Yes, we have to live

1085
01:55:27,654 --> 01:55:33,286
You jailor, Angel
It's been too long

1086
01:55:34,193 --> 01:55:39,563
One is gone
Next is yourturn

1087
01:55:41,734 --> 01:55:46,262
- Will Henry be dead?
- Eddy doesn't need Henry's help you, devil!

1088
01:55:55,682 --> 01:56:00,517
Anyway, they are going to live together
But, why this hurry now, Annie?

1089
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:07,253
Ourfamily doctor is like my dad to me
He has also approved of it

1090
01:56:09,228 --> 01:56:13,665
You're the only one around
to approve of it forAbey

1091
01:56:14,834 --> 01:56:20,170
It's not long since
Mercy has passed away So...

1092
01:56:20,273 --> 01:56:23,765
I'm sure she'll only be happy about it
I know it

1093
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:27,971
What happened to Mercy
should never happen to my Angel

1094
01:56:28,848 --> 01:56:34,081
However close he is to us
in front of others, he's only a stranger here!

1095
01:56:34,253 --> 01:56:37,689
Nobody should look at us
suspiciously anymore

1096
01:56:37,924 --> 01:56:40,825
Abey should live here with all the right!

1097
01:56:41,461 --> 01:56:45,363
People should not see Rosevilla
as a place, where there is no man

1098
01:56:45,999 --> 01:56:47,591
Please Simon

1099
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:50,135
I'm Angel's mom

1100
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:54,732
I'm thinking of you as Abey's father
and talking to you

1101
01:56:55,174 --> 01:56:57,142
That's...

1102
01:56:57,977 --> 01:56:59,604
Not an elaborate wedding

1103
01:56:59,779 --> 01:57:06,048
Right here, at Rosevilla, where Mercy's soul
is also present, just a small ceremony

1104
01:57:06,152 --> 01:57:07,449
An engagement

1105
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:16,119
Rest of it, you can plan with Abey's dad, Simon
and Father Paul and have it anywhere you want

1106
01:57:16,896 --> 01:57:18,193
What do you say, Abey?

1107
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:23,501
You have to decide

1108
01:57:23,603 --> 01:57:25,434
I'm ready for anything

1109
01:57:25,538 --> 01:57:28,837
Two rings have to be bought
I'll get that

1110
01:57:28,941 --> 01:57:33,969
Let that be my gift
What should I tell Annie?

1111
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,014
I'll obey anything that
Aunt Annie tells me to

1112
01:57:36,115 --> 01:57:39,278
But, I need to tell my dad before that
I want to see him

1113
01:57:39,385 --> 01:57:42,684
Don't delay that
Let that happen soon

1114
01:57:45,391 --> 01:57:49,487
I want to see his dad too,
get his blessings

1115
01:57:51,364 --> 01:57:53,195
Can I too go with Abey?

1116
01:58:21,494 --> 01:58:24,827
This is our 'Bethlehem'
My home

1117
01:58:25,998 --> 01:58:29,434
I've told you that
my house is biggerthan 'Rosevilla'

1118
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:34,440
You be here
I'll go get my dad

1119
01:58:34,807 --> 01:58:37,571
Let me see how he reacts
when he sees my Angel!

1120
01:58:51,858 --> 01:58:53,655
Don't shudder

1121
01:58:53,759 --> 01:58:57,855
One look at you and I know
it's Angel standing here

1122
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:04,401
You're the little angel
who has swooned away my boy

1123
01:59:04,504 --> 01:59:05,937
...by playing the violin

1124
01:59:06,038 --> 01:59:11,533
Abey and Jose have told so much about you
that you are very familiar to me now

1125
01:59:13,579 --> 01:59:16,776
Do you know who I am?

1126
01:59:16,883 --> 01:59:18,111
Father Paul

1127
01:59:18,217 --> 01:59:20,117
Yes, smart girl!

1128
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:22,710
Where is he?

1129
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:24,050
Gone to call his dad...

1130
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:27,820
He's left you alone here
and gone away?

1131
01:59:27,927 --> 01:59:29,292
Come with me, dear

1132
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:45,775
Dad, this is Angel

1133
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:47,976
You've come to take his blessings, right?

1134
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,809
Take it
This is my dad

1135
02:00:20,713 --> 02:00:21,805
Papa

1136
02:00:25,084 --> 02:00:30,886
He can understand everything
But, he can't bless you with his hands

1137
02:00:54,747 --> 02:01:01,175
I've told him so much about your music
He's looking forward to listening to it, isn't it?

1138
02:04:09,008 --> 02:04:13,945
Father
My dad!!!

1139
02:04:17,483 --> 02:04:20,577
I told you that God Himself will come down

1140
02:04:20,686 --> 02:04:26,591
See the power of music
Jesus, Praise be to You!

1141
02:05:16,976 --> 02:05:18,876
Angel, open your eyes

1142
02:05:19,044 --> 02:05:20,875
You thought I'm dead, you swine!

1143
02:05:25,618 --> 02:05:31,523
I had decided to stop all of this
It's you who has pulled me back again

1144
02:05:31,624 --> 02:05:34,855
You thought I wouldn't recognise you
in the dark?

1145
02:05:50,276 --> 02:05:52,039
It's me, Abey calling

1146
02:05:52,144 --> 02:05:53,236
Open your eyes

1147
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:04,687
Leave me!

1148
02:06:06,125 --> 02:06:09,891
Leave me
Let me...

1149
02:06:10,329 --> 02:06:12,422
Henry, leave me

1150
02:06:15,868 --> 02:06:17,597
Leave me

1151
02:06:18,237 --> 02:06:23,869
I wanted to abscond leaving everything
you won't allow me to

1152
02:06:33,619 --> 02:06:38,318
Leave me

1153
02:06:51,403 --> 02:06:52,563
Don't stop me

1154
02:06:52,871 --> 02:06:55,965
No!
I want to save her

1155
02:06:58,477 --> 02:06:59,637
Henry, no

1156
02:07:00,079 --> 02:07:03,344
I want to save her
Don't come near me

1157
02:07:04,116 --> 02:07:05,083
No

1158
02:07:21,300 --> 02:07:22,392
Oh no!

1159
02:08:28,767 --> 02:08:30,064
My Angel...

1160
02:08:31,637 --> 02:08:34,606
YourAngel is fine

1161
02:08:36,975 --> 02:08:39,671
She's sleeping now

1162
02:08:53,625 --> 02:08:55,354
I've not told her anything

1163
02:08:55,461 --> 02:08:56,359
What is it, doctor?

1164
02:08:57,663 --> 02:09:04,432
How can I tell him that
Angel will not be alive for long now?

1165
02:09:04,536 --> 02:09:05,764
Oh Jesus!

1166
02:09:06,805 --> 02:09:11,765
Brother!
What did this doctor say just now?

1167
02:09:11,877 --> 02:09:14,641
What is it, doctor?
I need to know

1168
02:09:14,747 --> 02:09:15,839
Brother!

1169
02:09:18,717 --> 02:09:21,811
Tell me what the doctor told you, brother

1170
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:27,324
Tell me
Just tell me, brother

1171
02:09:27,426 --> 02:09:32,523
I bought this for both of you
What do we do with this?

1172
02:09:32,965 --> 02:09:36,924
Angel!
She won't come back again

1173
02:09:37,703 --> 02:09:40,263
Who told you that
she won't come back?

1174
02:09:40,372 --> 02:09:46,936
Doctor, you are lying, isn't it?
You are lying, isn't it, brother?

1175
02:09:47,045 --> 02:09:48,137
She will come back

1176
02:09:48,247 --> 02:09:50,647
Angel will come back
if I call her

1177
02:09:50,816 --> 02:09:54,047
We should exchange these rings

1178
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:56,053
You forgot, brother

1179
02:09:56,755 --> 02:09:59,952
She promised my dad that
she'll go back to see him again

1180
02:10:00,392 --> 02:10:03,418
We are supposed to get married
at the church in Rajkumari

1181
02:10:03,529 --> 02:10:08,489
It's our wedding
We have to go back

1182
02:10:09,067 --> 02:10:11,228
This is her life

1183
02:10:11,336 --> 02:10:14,032
If I call her with this, she'll wake up
from even the deepest slumber

1184
02:10:14,139 --> 02:10:16,437
I know it
I'll call her

1185
02:10:16,542 --> 02:10:17,975
She'll wake up if I call her

1186
02:10:18,944 --> 02:10:20,969
No
I know

1187
02:10:21,079 --> 02:10:23,673
She'll wake up
if I call her

1188
02:10:27,052 --> 02:10:27,950
He...

1189
02:10:30,489 --> 02:10:32,787
There is very little time remaining

1190
02:10:32,891 --> 02:10:35,587
Let him be with her

1191
02:10:36,094 --> 02:10:39,655
We should do at least that much
for them, isn't it?

1192
02:12:31,476 --> 02:12:36,709
Angel, all that you had desired for,
all that we dreamt about

1193
02:12:36,848 --> 02:12:41,911
today is our wedding day
Wake up, Angel!
