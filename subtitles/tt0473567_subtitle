1
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,936
Hello, how are you?

2
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:23,677
Did you put in the article?
- Yes. It'll be in the newspapers soon.

3
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:27,612
Our articles are in demand go easy on the ink

4
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:31,416
The condition of this machine is not less than Kashmir.

5
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:35,953
How many more to go? - 3000 more to print.

6
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,692
Got the shirt?
- Got it.

7
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,431
He wore it and soiled it!
- You ass! You could...

8
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:47,439
...respect it a little. I gave it with such love!

9
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:50,974
We will wear clean shirts after independence.
- And what else?

10
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,445
We are getting freedom for your shirt, isn't it?

11
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:00,444
What's in there?

12
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,447
Brother Shakeel... that...

13
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,856
You met Majid?

14
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:31,079
We don't allow this in here.

15
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:32,876
Brother Shakeel... that...

16
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:36,685
The army! Shakeel, it's a raid!
- Idiot' you...!

17
00:04:37,657 --> 00:04:42,094
Take the pamphlets!

18
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:45,756
Come run fast... let's go from there...

19
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,496
Open the window... run fast...

20
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:55,664
Find everyone...

21
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:58,902
Check everywhere!
- Nobody here, Sir!

22
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,690
Cover that area...

23
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:25,528
Search everywhere... here behind too.

24
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:32,534
'Kashmir belongs to the Kashmiris'

25
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,807
Cover the back alley! Don't harass the locals!

26
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:02,568
Come on run fast...

27
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:19,250
Irfan! Get up, Irfan!

28
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,614
Start the car...

29
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:57,686
He's escaping via the left bank!

30
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:02,226
Get in or you'll be killed!

31
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:17,640
In history, tell me of one movement, where arms have not been taken up.

32
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:24,048
It's India's non violent struggle that gave us an enslaved Kashmir.

33
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:29,119
True, wars have been waged with the pen, printing pamphlets...

34
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:32,062
...but they have not been Won.

35
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,827
And if we have won, then tell me which ones.

36
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:40,663
Majid...

37
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:54,145
You see these teenagers? Tomorrow, they'll be killed too...

38
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,678
...and we will be guilty for not teaching them the true...

39
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:00,885
...essence of our war for freedom, nor how to win that war!

40
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:04,687
Aslam!

41
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:17,232
This is an Indian soldier. Don't you see in him the...

42
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,175
...man who burnt down your press?

43
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:43,729
I, Al-Sami, Commander-in-Chief of Al-jihad...

44
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:45,737
...want to inform you Shakeel...

45
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:53,735
...that to obtain our rights, we don't need the permission...

46
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:58,273
...of the Indian government, nor adhere to the rules of the UN.

47
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:27,976
First visit Sir?
- I came here 15 years ago.

48
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:29,274
When I was a small kid.
- The situation between...

49
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:30,782
...then and now has changed...

50
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:36,789
And these terrorist?
- Now terrorists target the locals as well.

51
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,791
They just want blood-shed.

52
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,253
In my five years of training I learnt this very well...

53
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,793
...that Kashmir's only language is a gun...

54
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:46,955
...it doesn't matter whether it is theirs or ours.

55
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:50,796
Who's Shakeel?
- He's Second-in-command of the...

56
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,271
...Al-jihad terrorist group. Al-Sami is their chief.

57
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:11,420
Sir, Captain Aman, Sir.

58
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,823
Ah Captain Aman. Send this immediately to the forward force.

59
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:17,021
Welcome my boy.
- Thank you, sir!

60
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:21,829
Aren't you the one who made the best records in mountain warfare?

61
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,232
Sir!

62
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:26,237
Welcome to RR force, the best!
- Thank you, sir.

63
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,241
Major Rathod is your Commander. Keep up with the good records.

64
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,904
Yes sir.
- All the best.
- Sure sir.

65
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,844
Did you train across the border?
- Yes, sir!

66
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:41,517
How much money did you get? - 15,000 Rupees.

67
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:43,855
Did you kill?
- Yes...

68
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:47,518
Scumbag!! The man you killed had a family. Take him away!

69
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:49,853
Come on get lost.

70
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,867
Gentlemen, here you have only one name
- RR force

71
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,264
...and this name can never be let down.

72
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:03,068
There's only one rule in this war - a bullet for a bullet!

73
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,207
While you are firing
- No regrets!

74
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:11,276
You shouldn't hesitate while hitting with the butt of your gun.

75
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:14,378
If in doubt, you are dead.

76
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:19,883
The honor of your Regiment is in your hands. Dismissed!

77
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:23,091
You really have a good aim.

78
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:26,561
You'll enjoy leading them. How was the game, soldiers?

79
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,890
Very good, sir!
- Good.

80
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:32,068
This is your Commander, Captain Aman. This is your platoon.

81
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:37,072
He is our opening act, the strongest in our platoon...

82
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:41,911
Our most accurate shot. He's got 34 kills!

83
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:46,108
He forms the last order! Kumble?
- He's is in the hospital, Sir

84
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,979
So captain... soldiers.
- Yes sir.

85
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,527
And Captain, steer clear of the locals.

86
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,928
So it seems we have an entire cricket team here!

87
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:27,417
Gurpal, it's been a week and absolutely no action!

88
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:32,157
It takes a minute for everything to change and then it won't stop.

89
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,361
Is that so?
- Yes sir...

90
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:38,164
Then it's only plastic bags To shit and piss in!

91
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,968
What happened, sir?

92
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:47,035
That's an informer, Sir. You can't trust anybody here.

93
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:48,511
Never know who else they are informing!

94
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,982
Sir, Major Rathod has called, sir. Says it's an emergency operation!

95
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:54,981
Let's go... come on.

96
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:59,247
Hey open the gate.

97
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:30,682
Get me the map.
- Yes Sir!

98
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:35,492
Sir, point 4269 here!

99
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:38,086
Cross bow... over there...

100
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:52,487
What are you doing?!
- Give it to me!

101
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,163
Jeans!

102
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,177
No peeking, okay?!

103
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:24,185
In a flash glittering maples gush sparkling

104
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:28,265
Saw a dream my twinkling eyes scream...

105
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:32,201
...a glimpse of my dreams spills out of me

106
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:36,332
...a fountain of it and the world says...

107
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:57,426
In a flash glittering maples gush sparkling

108
00:16:57,563 --> 00:17:01,499
Saw a dream my twinkling eyes scream...

109
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:05,627
...a glimpse of my dreams spills out of me

110
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,774
...a fountain of it and the world says...

111
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:52,481
Fresh dreams of a fresh youth...

112
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:56,620
...when did womanhood descend.

113
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:09,294
Fresh dreams of a fresh youth...

114
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:13,302
...when did womanhood descend.

115
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:17,499
Woke up to the world

116
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:25,915
and along came a new birth

117
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:38,729
Dreams play out in front of me

118
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:42,858
Play out a new game everyday

119
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:47,338
If the moon shatters Share the pieces with the world

120
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:51,340
Day in and day out Lets play our hearts out

121
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,356
Adaa... Open the door!

122
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:17,434
Hide it! Under the bed!

123
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:19,367
Hey open the door.

124
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:28,372
What's happening here?
- Hair Oil!
- Studying!

125
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:33,581
All at the same time! Did you go to school?

126
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,714
We got let off early.
- They said there was a bomb there!

127
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:46,925
Adaa!
- Gulzar? Get out of here!

128
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:52,937
What's this? Hmmmm...

129
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:23,499
Classes finished early?
- The Army has located Javed.

130
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:28,639
So why the long face?
- The Army has found him.

131
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:30,773
Hey bring Kaaba for him...

132
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:35,037
Mama, there's letter from the Chambu's

133
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,445
They want to see Adaa...
- Is that so?

134
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:40,713
Where are you going? Sit beside me.

135
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:45,788
Gulzar, she is doing wonders with her hand work

136
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:47,985
It's all God's grace.

137
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,053
That denim masterpiece isn't Too bad. Right, Adaa?

138
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:56,797
Won't it need a lot of time to be accepted here?

139
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,801
Not that long, Grandma.

140
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:06,878
28 days, and still no information about my son.

141
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,538
I hope that he's safe.

142
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:12,481
They don't even tell me if they have him in custody!

143
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:15,486
Javed Ahmed son of Sharif Ahmed!

144
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:19,684
Father...
- Javed, .

145
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,757
My son, my son...

146
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,496
Please sign here...

147
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:28,960
We are letting him go because we know he was kidnapped and...

148
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:30,968
...forced to train in their camp.
- Thank you sir.

149
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:34,499
Now his life is in your hands.
- Yes thank you sir.

150
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,900
Next, your name?

151
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:47,510
This is our bunker.

152
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:05,526
Gurpal, can we get some tea?
- Tea at this hour?

153
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:11,604
It's hard to believe that most movies were filmed here.

154
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:14,012
It's been a decade since a film crew dare to come here

155
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:19,082
Now these people aren't sacred of guns and bullets either.

156
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:21,877
They are speaking about Shammi Kapoor.

157
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:24,081
But who is this Shammi Kapoor?
- He's an actor.

158
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:25,817
Hey let me sleep.

159
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,756
But why would he dance here?

160
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,624
How should I know about it?
- Keep quiet.

161
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,961
Please tell us sister.

162
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:37,560
Hello? Can we get some tea?
- Sir, not to the locals!

163
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:42,639
Look, we're from the Army It's really cold here.

164
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,573
Sir! I'll arrange for it!

165
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:53,849
What's all this noise?!

166
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:56,579
Halt...

167
00:22:57,256 --> 00:23:01,920
If you want tea, tug on the rope once. If not, tug it on twice.

168
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,985
And if you want to throw it, pull it thrice!

169
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,863
Sir, do check it properly.
- I'll have to drink it to check it...

170
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,605
If you've finished with the tea, pull once. If not, pull twice.

171
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,138
And if you want more, keep pulling but you won't get any!

172
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:31,012
Let go... please!

173
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:38,160
I said let go of the rope!

174
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:49,165
You!

175
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,641
Sir, not the torch!

176
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:03,646
Turn off the torch!

177
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:08,049
Humph!

178
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:14,924
Some guts!

179
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,868
He's an Army man... said it was cold, so I made them some tea...

180
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:22,935
Why did he flash the torch?
- I don't know...!

181
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:28,338
Was there only one glass?
- He drank the glass as well!

182
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:31,949
They are still here?
- It got late. Curfew had started.

183
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:35,212
Sir, you shouldn't use torch here, this is Kashmir.

184
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:37,281
I'll deal with him!!

185
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:41,690
Do it in the morning Grandma!
- You keep quiet!

186
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,689
Sir, she's here!
- Who?

187
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:49,160
Why did you flash your torch at Adaa?

188
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:52,866
Adaa?
- Yes my granddaughter.

189
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,370
Her name is Adaa?

190
00:24:56,108 --> 00:25:01,045
Good Lord! He knows her name!
- You just told me, Ma'am!

191
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,708
Why did you do it?
- She gave me tea.

192
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:10,844
I just wanted to see her face.

193
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:13,721
Do you have to look at every girl who gives you tea?

194
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:19,997
Her father's asleep or you would have a kettle down your throat!

195
00:25:24,203 --> 00:25:28,333
What's this?
- Uh... cigarettes.

196
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:30,741
Give me one!

197
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:37,746
Name?
- Aman

198
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,347
Not yours, moron! The cigarette's?
- Oh... Benson...

199
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:47,888
Ever had local tobacco? Give me another!

200
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:50,918
Just 2 left, Ma'am. Take the packet.

201
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:54,759
No torches anymore!

202
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,348
You're from that house?

203
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:55,823
How did you come out in the curfew?

204
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:16,180
Our glass... Why did you keep it last night?

205
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:19,840
So I could see you again.
- Are you out of your mind?

206
00:27:21,853 --> 00:27:23,184
Since last night...

207
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:28,022
This is Kashmir! It makes mice out of the biggest studs!

208
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:34,322
I was hoping for that!
- Why did you give grandma cigarettes?

209
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,859
Yes!
- Why?

210
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:46,403
You had given me tea.
- Keep this, local tobacco.

211
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,871
How did you come about this?

212
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:52,341
I have ears too and I heard everything.

213
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:56,049
And don't you dare teach Grandma any more bad habits!

214
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:58,213
Come on Shree.

215
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:04,888
Is she your sister?
- Do you have a problem?

216
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:07,893
Why does she giggle so much?

217
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:14,068
At least someone is smiling here. You don't like that either?

218
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:54,939
Come in...

219
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:58,143
I don't have any glass that belongs to you. Come in.

220
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:03,352
What a pretty smile! Do you have a name?

221
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:08,949
Won't you tell me? Won't you speak with me?

222
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:23,975
Shree is a Hindu. A few years ago terrorists attacked her...

223
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:29,981
...village and massacred her family. A bullet grazed her throat and...

224
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:35,452
...she lost her speech ever since.
- And these people?

225
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,978
They adopted her despite being Muslims.

226
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:41,992
Now they celebrate every festival for her.

227
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,153
And that girl takes her as her younger sister.

228
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:47,060
I am off duty now, sir...

229
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:50,532
...I won't speak in an army language.

230
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:54,669
Sir, just see what kind of a place is this & what kind of people stay here.

231
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:58,201
But sir, they to are crushed between their animosity

232
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:01,275
Today, at least there's some activity going around...

233
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:03,280
it's so colourful here.

234
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,544
No, no, show me that.

235
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:11,514
I don't know how it looks on me?

236
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,558
I want this jewellery only.

237
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,096
Hi...

238
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:27,571
Recognize me?
- Uh... Yes...

239
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:29,038
Last night...

240
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:31,232
Yes... last night...
- Tea...

241
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:36,239
Tea? Yes, he came to tea last night.
- At night?

242
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:46,516
The local tobacco?
- Yes, he came for some tobacco...

243
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,387
What are you blabbering, Adaa?

244
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,590
I mean he came to sell... to buy tobacco. From... Where?

245
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:54,391
I'm from Pune

246
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:57,526
Pune? He came all the way here to buy tobacco?!

247
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,463
Let's go to the jewellery shop.
- That's where we are!

248
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:08,139
Right! Let's leave!

249
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,073
Who's he?
- Don't know.

250
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:15,083
Looks like an Army man.
- You do know what had happened to Rehana?

251
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:22,087
I'd better go. Greetings.

252
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,091
Hey...

253
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,102
Hey! Listen...

254
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:45,115
Me?

255
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:49,610
Why did you greet me in public!!

256
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:55,118
I'll greet you only in private then!

257
00:31:55,327 --> 00:32:02,130
Do you know what happens here to a girl found talking to a soldier?

258
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:11,134
What happens?
- She's either raped or her house...

259
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:17,148
...gets bombed! Understood?
- So I'm to pretend I don't know...

260
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:23,211
...you, in public.
- Why did You create such dolts?

261
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:31,155
Why hurt yourself for His mistake?
- Your logic! I'm leaving.

262
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:35,156
Adaa!

263
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,243
At least don't call out my name so loud! Please!

264
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:12,462
Grandma, when will all this end?

265
00:33:12,604 --> 00:33:13,730
All what?

266
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:18,200
All this violence, hatred and fear in the Valley.

267
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:22,605
Stop worrying about Kashmir! Just get married and go!

268
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:26,615
Where should I go?

269
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:31,553
Anywhere. But far away from here.

270
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:37,751
And look, I don't like that soldier!

271
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:41,560
Does he still flash his torch at you?

272
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:43,760
No!

273
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,438
What is it?
- My officer has called your daughter.

274
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:54,373
Who?
- Aman sir, who stays in the bunker opposite to your house.

275
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:59,577
The gall of the man! You're not going anywhere!

276
00:33:59,718 --> 00:34:06,453
Not her. The little girl. ...and you along with her.

277
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:17,597
Gopal, this is your prescription.

278
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:20,263
Doctor, this is the girl, I was talking about.

279
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:22,269
Come in Shree... Come and sit here.

280
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:26,270
Come and sit here, dear.

281
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:31,606
Show me your throat child.

282
00:34:31,683 --> 00:34:36,677
Just pass me the torch captain.

283
00:34:37,455 --> 00:34:44,691
How long has she been unable to talk?
- Two years.

284
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:48,896
Captain, it seems to be curable.

285
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:53,800
But I'll be able to diagnose it properly after some x-rays and tests.

286
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:57,308
I'll write it down, seeing the results...

287
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,310
...l'll be able to take any decisions.

288
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,380
Thank you very much doctor!
- No problem Captain.

289
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:07,309
These are the prescriptions.

290
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:12,322
Will you come to Chandigarh?

291
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,315
I know someone at that Military Hospital.

292
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:16,383
The treatment won't cost much.

293
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:18,862
I'll get the living arrangements done.

294
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:22,330
We'll think about it.

295
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:28,328
Bye Shree...
- Thank you!

296
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:44,348
Gurpal! Gurpal!

297
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:48,351
How's your torch doing?
- Sorry?

298
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:53,356
How's your torch doing?
- It's not working.

299
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:58,358
Then how do you drink tea?
- Gurpal makes it for me, Ma'am.

300
00:35:59,771 --> 00:36:01,363
Hmmm... Get it fixed.

301
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:47,415
Hey it's my turn now. See didn't I tell you?

302
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,610
See I got it out, now it's your turn...

303
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:52,416
...let's see if you can get it out or not.

304
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,625
Yes I can do, like this.

305
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:44,473
Peace efforts in Kashmir suffered a huge setback when militants...

306
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:51,141
...killed 32 civilians in Kanhabal. The victims include 8 children.

307
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:56,476
It's suspected that Al-Jihad's, Shakeel Ahmed is behind the attack.

308
00:37:56,821 --> 00:38:01,485
Today you'll see the real Kashmir. 32 people have been killed.

309
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:03,954
If we launch an aggressive enquiry Human Rights activists claim...

310
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:05,495
...'Military atrocities'.

311
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:09,827
If we don't the death toll triples by tomorrow!

312
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:13,029
So, in all of this, only listen to your conscience.

313
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:16,505
Let's move Jawans.

314
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:21,170
Get down...

315
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:24,507
Round up everyone!

316
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:32,111
Did the militants come here? Tell me the truth!

317
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:35,525
I am telling you the truth...

318
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:42,992
They didn't stay at our house! They attacked the entire village!

319
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:48,528
Liar! You don't deserve to live! Did they come?

320
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,535
Everything is clear sir...
- So go and search in the other places.

321
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:59,206
Come on tell me, they had come here?

322
00:38:59,283 --> 00:39:00,750
Please sir!

323
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:07,823
This is enough, sir.

324
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,552
Do you know whom you are speaking to?
- Yes sir.

325
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:16,559
This is against Army Rules, Sir!
- So you'll teach me the rules, eh?

326
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:18,565
I'll report this, Sir!

327
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:45,925
You'll report me?
- I'm sorry sir. But I will.

328
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:07,874
Move! Dismissed!

329
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:30,638
Get them some water!
- Yes sir.

330
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:48,656
Greetings sir...
- Greetings.

331
00:40:50,061 --> 00:40:54,930
Majid, what happened to your face?

332
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:59,002
I kept quiet because of you, otherwise I would've had shot him.

333
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,663
But what happened?
- He was bad mouthing us.

334
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:06,066
He said we should be grateful for...

335
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:09,671
...being allowed to enter here. That we're outsiders and should stay

336
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:11,840
...out of the Valley's affairs.

337
00:41:13,084 --> 00:41:15,075
Where is he?
- Here I am!

338
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:27,688
What's this?

339
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:29,164
'Terrorist Attack in Kanhabal'

340
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:34,034
Why was this done?
- There were military informers there.

341
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:41,170
8 children? How were they military informers?

342
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:49,312
Informers have no age. It's been long since an attack occurred here.

343
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:57,184
We need to remind India that we're around. That's the way of war.

344
00:41:57,261 --> 00:42:05,999
Our war is with the Indian Army. And it better stay that way.

345
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:15,875
We have new orders. There have to be three more attacks.

346
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:22,750
I didn't join you to take orders! Kashmir is mine and to restore my...

347
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:31,023
...people their rights, I don't need a hired mercenary like you!

348
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:34,754
Moin...

349
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,762
Can't we break away from them?

350
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:49,980
It's not the right time, Moin, but it won't be long either.

351
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:25,196
It's my daughter's wedding today. Is everything alright?

352
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:28,429
Of course, just routine duty.

353
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:31,202
Nothing to worry about. There's crowd here so we were just checking.

354
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:33,209
It's very cold outside would you like some tea?

355
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:37,940
For my soldiers please!
- I'll just get it for them.

356
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:42,012
Check upstairs too.
- Sir.

357
00:45:56,033 --> 00:46:01,494
Tea?
- Give it to my soldiers.

358
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:15,375
Tea?

359
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:18,249
Did everyone else take it?

360
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:23,988
They have. This one is yours.
- Can't see my name on it.

361
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:26,158
I'll write it, if you wish so.

362
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,401
This white... doesn't suit!

363
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:55,269
You were on duty in Kulgaon? How was the bride's father?

364
00:48:55,346 --> 00:48:59,680
He's ok, Sir. A little sad seeing his daughter leave.

365
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,153
And the whole of village is mourning today. Thirty bullet injuries!

366
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:08,354
His corpse was found near the ditch.

367
00:49:11,562 --> 00:49:16,158
Impossible, Sir! I went off duty half an hour ago.

368
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:20,167
Here, dozens are killed in less than half an hour.

369
00:49:22,506 --> 00:49:26,169
You can be court-martialed for this.

370
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:28,434
This occurred after my duty hours.

371
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:35,645
It happened despite being on duty. It's the same bloody Shakeel!

372
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:31,700
This point is 28 kms. From here.

373
00:50:56,667 --> 00:51:02,333
I don't know if I will return alive from this mission.

374
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:05,266
If I don't, then think of us

375
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:10,279
...as a beautiful dream that died. And if I do come back know that...

376
00:51:10,347 --> 00:51:15,944
...this dream will a reality soon Read ahead carefully...

377
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:16,342
There are two entry points in this village.

378
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:17,744
One from the south and one from the north west.

379
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:19,745
We can enter from here, sir.

380
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:25,612
I will go, sir.
- No.

381
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:27,526
Ready?
- Yes, sir.

382
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:36,538
Surrender or we will open fire!

383
00:55:39,149 --> 00:55:42,949
Who is he?
- That's Al-Sami! The Al-Jihad Chief!

384
00:55:44,087 --> 00:55:46,555
The Major has given us orders. Take no prisoners!

385
00:55:46,723 --> 00:55:56,564
No! Hold your fire!

386
00:56:01,972 --> 00:56:03,564
Hands behind your head!

387
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:29,793
'Allah-O-Akbar! '

388
00:56:39,009 --> 00:56:41,102
'Al-Jihad Chief Al-Sami in Custody...

389
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:53,153
...4 soldiers die in Encounter'

390
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:16,237
This... news...
- Soldiers live to die, Miss!

391
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:21,640
Please don't say that!
- When I left home, I told my wife I...

392
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:26,655
...was on a one-way ticket to Kashmir!
- Ya Allah!

393
00:57:34,197 --> 00:57:37,724
Pray to Him... He answers everyone's prayers!

394
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:13,695
This... paper...

395
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:19,702
Did you get hurt?

396
00:58:24,915 --> 00:58:28,715
One bullet... just grazed past me!

397
00:59:35,952 --> 00:59:44,326
In my remembrance, Think of me as the color of love

398
00:59:46,196 --> 00:59:54,968
Tracing me with your fingers, Mark my fair body with my name Adaa

399
00:59:56,206 --> 01:00:00,802
Sometimes the moon shines on us

400
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:05,804
At other times, the setting sun

401
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:16,990
Come along with me, Losing ourselves in the flowing river

402
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:23,325
Soon, a new dawn will arrive Enveloping...

403
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,336
...our Valley with a new spring

404
01:00:28,238 --> 01:00:32,436
Sometimes the moon shines on us

405
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:37,836
At other times, the setting sun

406
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:48,123
Remember me as the fresh mist of a bright morning.

407
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:59,029
As the snow falls... etch my name as Goodwill

408
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:04,398
At times it is the fire nearby.

409
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:09,937
At times it is the warmth of the fire.

410
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:15,074
Sometimes the moon shines on us

411
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:19,881
At other times, the setting sun

412
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:34,897
Let the night not pass, as you are here.

413
01:01:54,391 --> 01:02:02,127
Your smile ushers in my day

414
01:02:04,267 --> 01:02:11,264
Your embrace mellows me to sleep

415
01:02:14,544 --> 01:02:34,125
Keep me by your side until you make me yours forever

416
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,960
The sunshine will embrace us.

417
01:02:42,972 --> 01:02:47,966
The colours will envelope us.

418
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:52,979
The sunshine will embrace us.

419
01:02:53,249 --> 01:02:58,186
The colours will envelope us.

420
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:08,661
My memories consist of the colours of henna.

421
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:19,171
Etch my name with your finger.

422
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:24,538
Sometimes the moon shines on us

423
01:03:25,548 --> 01:03:30,008
At other times, the setting sun

424
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:35,221
Sometimes the moon shines on us

425
01:03:36,426 --> 01:03:41,193
At other times, the setting sun

426
01:04:03,386 --> 01:04:07,254
Sometimes the moon shines on us

427
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:13,054
At other times, the setting sun

428
01:04:43,693 --> 01:04:47,254
I'm Gulzar, Adaa's father.

429
01:04:47,363 --> 01:04:49,422
Please come in. Have a sit.

430
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:51,763
I need not speak the reason of my arrival.

431
01:04:54,504 --> 01:05:00,374
After all we have been through, the only thing we have is our dignity.

432
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:07,108
And you Army people don't have any regards for that! We know we're...

433
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:12,120
...a fear-stricken, destitute lot. And you are equally to blame as...

434
01:05:12,188 --> 01:05:14,782
...the militants from across!

435
01:05:15,658 --> 01:05:18,388
And don't think that our blood has turned water.

436
01:05:19,529 --> 01:05:24,398
As a father, I have the right to slap you.

437
01:05:25,535 --> 01:05:29,301
And by God, I will not repent it.

438
01:05:30,306 --> 01:05:32,467
But as the father of...

439
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:37,138
...a Kashmiri girl, I have to bear the humiliation.

440
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:43,146
Is this how you protect us?

441
01:05:43,486 --> 01:05:45,647
You are playing with our dignity.

442
01:05:47,557 --> 01:05:49,149
Adaa's marriage has been arranged.

443
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:58,833
She will leave the Valley soon.

444
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:05,369
If you have a sister at home...

445
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:07,170
...keep off your hands from Adaa for her sake.

446
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:11,171
Allow us to live peacefully.

447
01:07:02,298 --> 01:07:04,232
Father...

448
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:45,867
Which way to the Army camp?
