confidence long before that..

from my body language.

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,435
Pooja Talwar, have you got
anything to say about this divorce?

72
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:44,834
Your Honour, he is not so bad.

ln fact, he's a good friend,
but something is..

getting worse and worse.

better off as friends.

77
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,834
We can't think on the same level.

00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,367
You? What about you?

79
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:17,566
To be frank, Your Honour.

80
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,568
lt's Pooja who wants divorce,
not me.

81
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:26,366

The judge didn't bang his gavel
on the table, but on my heart.

85
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,167
And suddenly my mind
turned into a blaring radio..

86
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:43,434
..whose frequencies had
gone haywire.

87
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:45,166
l'd tune into a
station playing love songs..

88
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:47,300
..but all l could hear
was songs full of hatred.

89
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,100
After the songs,
jingles of negativity..

90
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:51,166
..and frustration would take over.

91
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:53,700
Ego hassles. Compatibility.

92
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:56,033
This relationship
terminology was too much to take..

93
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,700
..for my middle class upbringing.

94
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:00,067
Gradually, l forgot
how to spell confidence..

95
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:02,166
..and soon it became confusion.

96
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,533

97
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,166
''Radio.''

Your spare keys.

99
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:17,067
This is my Lord Ganesha.

100
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:21,769
Let Him live in an AC
car worth Rs.2.5 million.

101
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:24,767
My Lord Ganesha doesn't
need your AC.

102
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,234
Anyway, no one's going to be with..

103
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,234
With me? What are you talking about?

104
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:35,269
Whatever. l don't want to
fight with you on this great day.

105
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,433
So, bye.

106
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:12,203
''Son-in-law.''

107
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:32,503
''Son-in-law has come to my place.''

108
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:36,503
''He's looking at
everything curiously.''

109
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:40,602
''Everyone loves son-in-law.''

110
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,968
''Son-in-law has come to my place.''

111
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:48,967
Divorce and
son-in-law are as different..

112
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:51,100
..as bitter-gourd and sugarcane.

113
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,967
Even the world's craziest
person would think twice..

114
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,099
..before becoming
someone's son-in-law..

115
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,232
..after getting divorced.

116
00:08:56,366 --> 00:09:00,303
Because it doesn't take much
time for marriage to turn bitter.

117
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,435
But some people never even
gave me freedom to think about it.

118
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:05,633
My story is a bit weird.

119
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,901
As weird as this family
who is hell-bent..

120
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,301
..on making me their son-in-law.

121
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:13,533
Her mother is Parsi.

122
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:17,201
On a scale of ten for insanity,
l'll give her seven.

123
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:20,634
Her father is Punjabi.
l'll give him Nine.

124
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,101
And she is their
genetic cocktail. Shanaya.

125
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:26,101
lf l have my way, l'll
give her 100 out of 10.

126
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,300
And believe me, this
won't be enough for her.

127
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:32,569
lt's a long story which begins on
the night when Pooja divorced me.

00:23:36,432 --> 00:23:38,433
l'm very happy being single,
and l'm very serious.

Does he know that you love him?
- He does know.

352
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:44,500
Every guy can sense it.

353
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:47,701
But, he's too scared
because of his past experiences.

354
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:49,701
l mean, he's just so
scared of relationships.

355
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:51,167
You're iust so scared.

356
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:53,167
Scared of relationships.
- Yes, l am.

357
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:55,034
He will never accept..

358
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,501
..that he can fall in
Iove with anyone else again.

359
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:58,700
But, one day he will say.

00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:03,437
Seem lost, seem found.
Seem defeated.

361
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:08,770
Seem distressed. Seem happy.
l feel forlorn.

362
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:11,567
l can't forsake you?

363
00:24:11,632 --> 00:24:14,167

Great news, everyone.

We iust broke our old record.

Seven months ago, the show on
which we first aired the song..

415

- Oh, yes.

Right, l feel something
when l hear your voice.

What do you feel? Do you feel pain?
- Yes, l do.

422
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,770
A sweet one. No, actually,
it feels like Krackjack.

Sweet and salty. 50-50, you know.

Slowly, our ratings increased.

- Bye.

You are Shanaya's boyfriend.

429
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,901
Why would l lie to
you about such a thing?

430
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:04,767
Because you're scared of me.

431
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:09,034
Then, you can think
whatever you want.

432
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:11,434
l want to hear you say it.

433
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:14,300
But, l'm not your
daughter's boyfriend.

434
00:29:16,332 --> 00:29:17,399
Shanaya.

435
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:30,703
Fine. If you aren't
Shanaya's boyfriend, then..

436
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:35,704
..it shouldn't make a
difference to you, because..

437
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:40,303
..starting from tomorrow
Shanaya is under house-arrest.

438
00:29:48,032 --> 00:29:49,400
You're a fool, Vivan.

439
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:51,100
They are not getting
you married to her.

440
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:52,366
Say that you're her boyfriend.

441
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,769
Look, there's no clause about
doing social-service in my contract.

442
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:57,900
This isn't my problem.

443
00:29:57,966 --> 00:29:59,300
Hey, shut up. You, shut up.

444
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,366
l'll call you back, Pooia.

445
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:06,433
No, no don't fool
around with me, man.

446
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:11,036
Do you know, this show is
worth 80 million a week?

447
00:30:11,165 --> 00:30:13,233
That's 320 million a month.

448
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:16,767

449
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:21,236
And, if l am.. you all are.

450
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:30,166
Should l toss a coin?

451
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:34,100
No, l mean if you're confused..

452
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,432
..then, lets toss a coin and decide.

453
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:42,436
Decisions of love are not
made by tossing coins, sir.

454
00:30:44,032 --> 00:30:46,234
l mean.. Daddy.

455
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:51,435
Wow.

456
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:57,835
What a dialogue, my man.

457
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,368
Radio people earn by
speaking such dialogues.

458
00:31:02,766 --> 00:31:04,634
At least now l know, my daughter..

459
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:07,368
..won't starve with you.

You've made me so happy.

461

Do you have a backache?

462
00:31:13,966 --> 00:31:15,634
No, l mean if it isn't too much
of a trouble in bending down..

463
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,367
..you can take daddy's blessings.

464
00:31:17,766 --> 00:31:23,771
That's the best way to
win over Shanaya's mummy.

My problem is that who
will teach the dogs to act.

490

Then, why don't you
talk to a dog trainer.

No, not a train, l want
to make a film on dogs.

Will you just keep saying yes,
or give a solution to my problem?

501
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:16,101
We don't have one.
Better find a dog trainer.

'..Shanaya me and l
Shanaya were absolutely..

00:56:30,466 --> 00:56:31,600
..out of character that night# 

868
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:34,235
That's what l am
asking her?. What's wrong?

869
00:56:36,165 --> 00:56:37,332
'We were behaving like kids# 

870

lt's fun to break plates.

872
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:43,534
Eat some, break some.

873
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,268
Yes! - It goes for you all too.
- Come on!

874

But sir.. - 'l'd heard in my
childhood that breakingage of..

Keep breaking them.
- Here l go.

''Lovely! Just do it.''
- What are you doing?

Keep at it.
- Don't break the plates.

883
00:57:06,265 --> 00:57:09,434
Very good. Keep at it. Break
some more. Break some more.

Friends, the first
song of Shanaya and your..

888
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:26,167
..album is about to be recorded.

889
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:51,139
''Whenever you smiled..

890
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:55,436
..l felt..

891
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:01,637
''..that there's a purpose to life.''

892
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:09,273
''Yes, there's a purpose to life.''

893
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:16,406
''Why does the heart
harbour sadness?''

894
00:58:16,466 --> 00:58:23,206
''lt loves unconditionally,
but suffers each moment.''

895
00:58:24,032 --> 00:58:29,437
''Yes, the wretched one
thing doesn't accept..''

896
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:36,170
Sleeping?
- It's 3am, Pooja.

897
00:58:36,232 --> 00:58:38,500
Oops. l completely forgot that.

898
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:42,368
You dream about good things at 3am.

899
00:58:44,299 --> 00:58:46,067
Who are you dreaming about?

900
00:58:50,299 --> 00:58:56,972
Are you drunk?
- No. l'm not drunk. l'm not drunk.

901
00:58:59,165 --> 00:59:00,232
l'm not drunk.

902
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:03,068
You know, Vivan, l went to a party.

903
00:59:06,966 --> 00:59:09,068
Everyone was talking about you.

904
00:59:09,933 --> 00:59:12,101
About how successful your show is.

905
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,203
About how good the chemistry
between Shanaya and you is.

906
00:59:17,165 --> 00:59:20,334
Everybody was saying you
guys are good together.

907
00:59:21,232 --> 00:59:24,268
Like a couple. Nice couple.

908
00:59:24,966 --> 00:59:26,567
Pooja, we will talk tomorrow morning.
- Tell me one thing.

909
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:30,234
You say that you are like friends.

910
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,072
Are you like 'just buddies' or
'''physically intimate buddies?'''

911
01:00:04,898 --> 01:00:07,033
Hi!
- Vivan.

912
01:00:08,631 --> 01:00:09,665
l'm really sorry.

913
01:00:10,531 --> 01:00:12,733
Whatever happened last night..

914
01:00:13,464 --> 01:00:14,565
lt's ok, Pooia.

915
01:00:15,631 --> 01:00:19,901
l.. l.. l don't know
what l was saying..

916
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,432
lt's.. l..

917
01:00:23,831 --> 01:00:25,566
l didn't mean it that way.

918
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,766
You have said sorry.
It's okay with me.

919
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:33,901
But yes, don't talk about
all this in front of Shanaya.

920
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,032
The situation will
become very awkward.

921
01:00:38,697 --> 01:00:40,498
l was drunk last night, Vivan.

922
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,466
l promise it'll never happen again.
- Cool.

923
01:00:49,564 --> 01:00:51,365
Brother-in-law, it's gone.

924
01:00:52,564 --> 01:00:53,631
ls it coming?

925
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:55,498
Oh! It's gone again.

926
01:00:56,497 --> 01:00:58,498
Brother-in-law, it's gone again.

927
01:00:58,564 --> 01:01:02,434
Son-in-law. - Is it coming?
- Is it coming, papa?

928
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:05,365
lt comes, it goes.. Can't you see?

929
01:01:06,898 --> 01:01:08,366
Will you say it from
here or will you go there..

930
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:09,899
..and ask him to turn it a bit?

931
01:01:11,697 --> 01:01:16,001
ls it coming? - Brother-in-law,
it's better. Turn it a bit more.

932
01:01:16,998 --> 01:01:21,369
Papa.
- Now? - Now? Papa.

933
01:01:23,431 --> 01:01:26,100
Papa. Papa. You are
giving me a headache.

934
01:01:27,431 --> 01:01:30,100
We are getting Pakistani channels,
but not ours.

935
01:01:30,364 --> 01:01:33,100
What a transistor!
- Papa, it's not my job.

936
01:01:34,364 --> 01:01:35,965
This is not my iob. l am an RJ.

937
01:01:36,364 --> 01:01:37,765
l'm not a dish antenna mechanic.

938
01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:41,567
l am trying.
- Leave the plate..

939
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:45,568
..hold the spoon. Hold the spoon.

940
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,299
Explain it to him.
- That tall stand, brother-in-law.

941
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,398
That one.
- What tall stand!

942
01:01:51,731 --> 01:01:52,798
Forget it!

943
01:01:53,597 --> 01:01:55,298
Yes, brother-in-law. One
more try. Please one more try.

944
01:01:55,364 --> 01:01:57,499
Brother-in-law, for me.
One last try. Please.

945
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:04,765
Papa, give me one.

946
01:02:07,564 --> 01:02:10,300
You gave me just one.
- If you eat all the peas..

947
01:02:10,364 --> 01:02:11,498
..what will we make curry with?

948
01:02:12,364 --> 01:02:14,032
Here. It's done?

949
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:17,033
What done! We need to peel them all.

950
01:02:17,297 --> 01:02:19,565
When we cook them they
will become this small..

951
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,532
Have meals with us.
She cooks very well.

952
01:02:23,631 --> 01:02:26,000
And for you l won't
even use chilies today.

953
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:28,765
Yes. -Vivan has a
meeting in a music company.

954
01:02:30,364 --> 01:02:33,300
People say.. Your
daughter has become a star.

955
01:02:33,964 --> 01:02:36,433
And l reply.. Not iust my daughter..

956
01:02:36,497 --> 01:02:38,832
..but our would-be
son-in-law is a superstar.

957
01:02:40,364 --> 01:02:42,566
Why are annoying him, father?

958
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:47,233
Look, the women of this
house have got one big problem.

959
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:48,832
They won't let others talk.

960
01:02:49,898 --> 01:02:52,967
You don't worry, papa.
You are a policeman.

961
01:02:54,564 --> 01:02:56,933
We will get even with
the women of this house.

962
01:02:59,831 --> 01:03:01,232
We will definitely..

963
01:03:03,764 --> 01:03:07,234
What happened?
Tell me what happened.

964
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:09,965
Dad, a caterpillar.

965
01:03:12,297 --> 01:03:15,366
Finally someone's able to scare you.

966
01:03:15,431 --> 01:03:19,701
Papa, was there a lion in the pea?

967
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:23,499
'So that was this Parsi-Punjabi
family's matinee show# 

968
01:03:23,564 --> 01:03:25,232
'Night show won't be so much fun.# 

969
01:03:25,297 --> 01:03:27,365
'..as DCP sir would be on duty# 

970
01:03:27,431 --> 01:03:30,233
'lt's not as much fun if even
one crazy member's missing# 

971
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:37,767
l shouldn't be telling
you my family secrets.

972
01:03:38,497 --> 01:03:40,432
What if my father
had got a heart attack!

973
01:03:41,898 --> 01:03:43,499
And where did this
meeting crop up from?

974
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:50,167
Vivan, we shall stop this game now.

975
01:03:50,898 --> 01:03:52,633
Why? l am enioying it.

976
01:04:01,898 --> 01:04:03,165
But it's your life.

977
01:04:04,464 --> 01:04:06,365
lf we play more the
hurt will be more, right?

978
01:04:12,297 --> 01:04:13,765
On 24th the video will be shot.

979
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:17,299
Shall we make Pooia choreograph it?

980
01:04:17,364 --> 01:04:18,431
Yes, she's very good.

981
01:04:19,764 --> 01:04:21,832
Ok, shall we go to dinner
tomorrow night, the three of us?

982
01:04:21,898 --> 01:04:24,166
There we will discuss
how to shoot this song.

983
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:26,232
Ok, done.

984
01:04:55,764 --> 01:04:57,098
She's a strange girl.

985
01:04:58,697 --> 01:05:00,765
l don't care if she doesn't come.

986
01:05:02,364 --> 01:05:06,101
Pooja, let's order. l'm very hungry.
Excuse me! - Yes, sir.

987
01:05:06,564 --> 01:05:07,831
Please send someone.
- Sure, sir.

988
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:18,699
She's not coming.
- Why?

989
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:23,297
Don't know.

990
01:05:25,364 --> 01:05:28,567
Maybe she told her family about it.
- What?

991
01:05:30,831 --> 01:05:34,367
That all this between her and me..
That all this was a game.

992
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,099
Excuse me, ma'am! May l help you?

993
01:05:39,764 --> 01:05:42,066
What would you have?
- Anything.

994
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:48,032
One.. - 'l was very upset.
But my defense mechanism.# 

995

'..was making me do the opposite
of what l was supposed to do# 

996

'l was upset, but yet l was
yet trying to crack a joke# 

997
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:04,698
Anything else?
- Just get that.

998
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:06,698
Ok, ma'am.
- Thanks. - You are welcome.

So? - l can't believe you
just said that. - l say.

1000
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:20,166
Vivan, l miss your sense of humor.

1001

'ln spite of being together
for six years we weren't close# 

1002

Yes, there are some
benefits of divorce.

1020
01:08:19,164 --> 01:08:20,632

Negative? Positive?
- Oh definitely positive. Positive.

1034
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:52,301
Earlier when he used to talk it
was as if he was spitting venom.

1035
01:09:59,964 --> 01:10:02,566
Then marryiage him again.

1036
01:10:04,497 --> 01:10:05,564
lt will be great fun.

1037
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:13,968
Go and make coffee. Go. Go.

1038
01:10:14,564 --> 01:10:17,233
''Can't twist and turn.''

1039
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,966
''l can't forget you.''

1040
01:10:28,564 --> 01:10:29,831
What happened?

1041
01:10:31,431 --> 01:10:33,166
Peps, l was thinking..
- What were you thinking?

1042
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,298
That why don't you
ever behave like a man?

1043
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,098
Why? What's wrong with me?

1044
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:39,432
Have l ever asked you
to behave like a girl?

1045
01:10:44,197 --> 01:10:45,264
Vivan.

1046
01:10:54,164 --> 01:10:56,900
This is the 12th round that we
can hear from this building.

1047
01:10:56,964 --> 01:10:59,433
And in reply the
policemen have also fired.

1048
01:10:59,497 --> 01:11:01,765
Let me tell you one more
time that you are watching..

1049
01:11:01,831 --> 01:11:05,100
..the exclusive pictures of
a live shootout only on TV81 .

1050
01:11:05,164 --> 01:11:07,900
Up or down?.. Tell Palekar..
- Right now we don't know..

1051
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:10,499
..if they are normal ordinary
gangsters or dangerous terrorists.

1052
01:11:10,898 --> 01:11:13,967
But whoever they are they
have got lots of explosives..

1053
01:11:13,998 --> 01:11:15,999
Firing's going on from both sides.

1054
01:11:19,831 --> 01:11:20,898
Close the door.

1055
01:11:23,497 --> 01:11:25,232
We shall go a bit closer
and see what's going on.

1056
01:11:25,297 --> 01:11:28,299
See her. See her.
- Sir, this TV girl will die today.

1057
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:30,232
Patil. Patil. Stop her.

1058
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:33,300
lf she gets so close she
will get a bullet. Stop her.

1059
01:11:34,898 --> 01:11:37,500
And as you can see..
- Hey! Come back.

1060
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,765
Come back. Do Yyou
want to die? Come back.

1061
01:11:39,831 --> 01:11:41,165
All of them want breaking news.

1062
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:44,031
They will get breaking news once
they break their necks breaks.

1063
01:11:45,297 --> 01:11:48,433
So.. Have we made some mistake?

1064
01:11:49,297 --> 01:11:50,998
Have we made some mistake?
- No.

1065
01:11:51,697 --> 01:11:53,832

01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:55,966
What?
- l mean it's good.

1067
01:11:57,898 --> 01:11:59,966
We have been barred
from going inside.

1068
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:01,698
Our exclusive coverage..
- So our superstar son-in-law..

1069
01:12:01,764 --> 01:12:03,699
..has become so busy
that he doesn't come..

1070
01:12:03,764 --> 01:12:05,699
..even when we call him.
- ..you mustn't have seen..

1071
01:12:05,764 --> 01:12:07,031
..a police encounter from so close.

1072
01:12:07,097 --> 01:12:10,366
He's gone. Patil. Patil. Patil.

1073
01:12:11,697 --> 01:12:14,766
Didn't Shanaya didn't tell
you anything? - Patil, come in.

1074
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,766
Patil, come in. Come in, Patil.

1075
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:21,097
Pa..

1076
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,699
Oh! It's been two hours.

1077
01:12:23,731 --> 01:12:27,835
They have just gone overboard.
Come on.

1078
01:12:30,097 --> 01:12:31,298
Sir, who are they?
- Move aside.

1079
01:12:31,364 --> 01:12:35,701
Sir,
- Move. - Sir. Please, sir. Sir.

1080
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:44,231
PCP..
- Shanaya.

1081
01:12:45,164 --> 01:12:48,166
She is in the show, Vivan.
- Hi, Peps.

1082
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:50,765
Please get me to talk to Shanaya.

1083
01:12:50,831 --> 01:12:53,166
Play any song.
- Cross-firing is going on.

1084
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,333
lt's my life and death.
- Song break is five minutes away.

1085
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,931
But buddy, you sound like
you are in love with her.

1086
01:12:59,764 --> 01:13:01,966
See this. One more gangster is shot.

1087
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:05,633
Love? No. - Accept it if you
want to or else don't accept it.

1088
01:13:05,697 --> 01:13:07,098
You are my shrink.
You know everything.

1089
01:13:07,164 --> 01:13:09,900
Will you let me talk to her now or..
- Ok, fine. Relax.

1090
01:13:10,164 --> 01:13:11,231
l'll put your call through.

1091
01:13:11,297 --> 01:13:13,899
But don't tell your name.
l'll lose my job.

1092
01:13:13,964 --> 01:13:17,300
Firing has resumed begun again..
- Hello, you have reached 98.3 FM.

1093
01:13:17,364 --> 01:13:19,833
l am Shanaya. What shall l call you?

1094
01:13:20,831 --> 01:13:23,099
You can call me anything.
l have a problem.

1095
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:28,633
Look, l know a girl
and her family thinks..

1096
01:13:28,664 --> 01:13:31,066
..l am their would-be son-in-law.

1097
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,631
But the truth is that
there is nothing of that sort..

1098
01:13:33,697 --> 01:13:34,831
..between that girl and me.

1099
01:13:36,097 --> 01:13:37,898
Hello! Hello!

1100
01:13:39,097 --> 01:13:44,836
Yes. Yes. - So that girl said
that she will talk to her family.

1101
01:13:44,964 --> 01:13:47,299
But she didn't. Why must
would she have done such a thing?

1102
01:13:48,764 --> 01:13:51,766
May be that girl got a bit scared.
- Got scared?

1103
01:13:52,764 --> 01:13:55,766
But l want to tell her not
to get scared. l am with her.

1104
01:13:56,898 --> 01:13:57,965
Thank you.

1105
01:13:58,297 --> 01:14:01,700
l mean thank you on
that girl's behalf.

1106
01:14:01,998 --> 01:14:03,599
And today l am going to her house.

1107
01:14:03,964 --> 01:14:06,066
Why should that girl alone be
stuck in this problem alone?

1108
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:08,965
You shouldn't go there.
- l will go there.

1109
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:10,965
You are making a very big mistake.

1110
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,832
That's wrong pronunciation.
And l am not making a mistake.

1111
01:14:13,898 --> 01:14:16,166
l will go there. Thanks
for talking to me. Bye.

1112
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:19,967
Hello! Hello!
- Take him away.

1113
01:14:20,697 --> 01:14:21,764
We are preparing 'Kadi'
(a curry) at home today.

1114
01:14:22,164 --> 01:14:24,165
Will you come?
- Take him inside. Take him inside.

1115
01:14:24,297 --> 01:14:25,831
He ruined my shirt.

1116
01:14:26,964 --> 01:14:30,233
Take him along. He is.. - l will
definitely come. - Pick him up.

1117
01:14:30,297 --> 01:14:31,564
And tell mummy that she
can use as many as chilies..

1118
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:33,299
..as she wishes to.

1119
01:14:34,164 --> 01:14:35,698
l am not scared of chilies.

1120
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:51,833
Come on,
brother-in-law. You can do it.

1121
01:14:51,898 --> 01:14:53,633
Come on, boy.

1122
01:14:53,898 --> 01:14:57,501
Come on.
- Finish it, son. - Come on, buddy.

1123
01:14:58,697 --> 01:15:00,165
Where are you going, Soni?

1124
01:15:00,564 --> 01:15:03,233
lf your Vivan cries,
will we wipe his tears?

1125
01:15:04,964 --> 01:15:07,499
Water?
- Great, you transistor.

1126
01:15:07,531 --> 01:15:09,799
Take.
- No water. Take it away.

1127
01:15:10,097 --> 01:15:13,500
'l took a firm decision, but
still l couldn't gather courage.# 

1128
01:15:13,564 --> 01:15:17,100
'..to tell Shanaya's
family about it# 

1129
01:15:27,097 --> 01:15:31,968
Shanaya, with your family l feel
like l got a family, you know..

1130
01:15:36,497 --> 01:15:39,867
What is a family? l never knew that.

1131
01:15:42,931 --> 01:15:44,032
Listen..

1132
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:47,699
Whomever you will marry, tell
them that he will get only you.

1133
01:15:47,898 --> 01:15:49,432
Your family is already booked.

1134
01:15:51,564 --> 01:15:54,033
Pooia, do you like this?

1135
01:15:54,564 --> 01:15:57,433
Nice, but l think it will
merge with other colors.

1136
01:15:57,964 --> 01:15:59,031
Try this one.

1137
01:16:04,697 --> 01:16:05,898
This looks nice.

1138
01:16:06,164 --> 01:16:08,566
Shanaya, let's make
a deal. Your family..

1139
01:16:08,631 --> 01:16:12,434
Pooja, isn't this a bit tight here?
- Just give it a try.

1140
01:16:12,497 --> 01:16:13,865
No, l want to go
find something else.

1141
01:16:13,964 --> 01:16:15,565
Let's go find something please.
- Ok, then.

1142
01:16:16,063 --> 01:16:17,531
Ok..
- l got it.

1143
01:16:19,497 --> 01:16:22,099
A great idea for the
Iast song of the new album.

1144
01:16:22,764 --> 01:16:26,100
A family which warmth, love..

1145
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:29,033
A family that l never had.
How is it?

1146
01:16:29,497 --> 01:16:30,564
Rotten.

1147
01:16:32,497 --> 01:16:36,834
Why? - We are targeting youth,
not the old.

1148
01:16:37,497 --> 01:16:39,765
But..
- No. - Just one song..

1149
01:16:39,831 --> 01:16:41,832
No. No. No.

1150
01:16:44,497 --> 01:16:45,831
You know what, actually..

1151
01:16:46,798 --> 01:16:49,867
Enough. l am tired. l
don't want to do another album.

1152
01:16:50,464 --> 01:16:54,100
After this one, no more please.

1153
01:16:55,497 --> 01:16:59,767
You will get another
back-up vocalist.

1154
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:03,097
Shanaya.

1155
01:17:07,964 --> 01:17:10,766
You're the one who said
life is beautiful. And now..

1156
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:14,097
Yes.

1157
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,699
Of course, life is beautiful. Sure.

1158
01:17:20,364 --> 01:17:22,866
And you know what, l am very hungry.

1159
01:17:22,964 --> 01:17:24,365
l am hungry.

1160
01:17:27,697 --> 01:17:28,764
l'm hungry.

1161
01:17:41,697 --> 01:17:45,700
Superstar? Superstar, Vivan?
- Give me.

1162
01:17:54,731 --> 01:17:56,699
This guy washes the
dishes very well.

1163
01:17:57,531 --> 01:17:58,798
Not very well, but nicely.

1164
01:17:59,964 --> 01:18:03,300
This guy washes the dishes nicely.

1165
01:18:04,631 --> 01:18:06,432
Should we hire him
to wash the dishes?

1166
01:18:06,898 --> 01:18:09,967
l had one for five years.
- Today's day.

1167
01:18:12,497 --> 01:18:15,967
Do you still remember it?
- Of course.

1168
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:19,297
Mumbai was flooding.

1169
01:18:20,831 --> 01:18:22,632
Shanaya, do you know..
Pooja and l had reached..

1170
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:24,965
..and the clerk of
the court was missing.

1171
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:27,832
Do you remember, the judge
himself typed the papers?

1172
01:18:27,898 --> 01:18:29,699
There were so many
spelling mistakes.

1173
01:18:29,731 --> 01:18:32,300
Yes, man. Shanaya,
can you believe it..

1174
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:35,366
The judge missed out ARR
from the word 'Marriage# 

1175
01:18:36,964 --> 01:18:38,432
He made Mirage out of word Marriage.

1176
01:18:49,831 --> 01:18:54,302
No.. don't do that. No!
Don't do that!

1177
01:18:57,497 --> 01:18:58,564
Naughty.

1178
01:19:01,864 --> 01:19:03,465
Marriage has really become mirage.

1179
01:19:04,631 --> 01:19:06,232
l lost it and couldn't find it.

1180
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:13,499
Today is your
marriage anniversary, right?

1181
01:19:30,764 --> 01:19:34,467
lt is a good omen.
- Yeah.

1182
01:19:38,431 --> 01:19:43,502
Break one more.
- Hey, you guys.. enough. What?

1183
01:19:56,431 --> 01:19:58,900
Jhandulal Tyagi.

1184
01:20:00,431 --> 01:20:03,767
Hello? - Yes, madam.
Is this airplane booking?

1185
01:20:03,831 --> 01:20:06,466
Yes.
- Tell me one thing.

1186
01:20:06,864 --> 01:20:09,733
There's a place named
Kasauli beyond Delhi. - Yes.

1187
01:20:10,731 --> 01:20:13,233
Where do you stay?
- l? Mumbai.

1188
01:20:13,297 --> 01:20:15,632
Mumbai is a very big city. Isn't it?
- Yes.

1189
01:20:15,697 --> 01:20:18,299
lt is a very big city.
- Yes, it is.

1190
01:20:18,364 --> 01:20:20,899
Does the whole area lie
in your district? - What?

1191
01:20:21,564 --> 01:20:23,232
Since how many years
do you stay here?

1192
01:20:23,297 --> 01:20:25,766
l was born here.
- Why?

1193
01:20:26,297 --> 01:20:29,366
Sorry? - l mean there must
be some hill stations around?

1194
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:32,231
Panchagani is a hill station.

1195
01:20:32,297 --> 01:20:36,234
l am asking you about Kasauli and
you're talking about Panchagani.

1196
01:20:36,297 --> 01:20:37,564
Sir, but you asked me
whether there were some..

1197
01:20:37,631 --> 01:20:41,167
Yes, so how much money does

01:20:41,197 --> 01:20:43,165
Sir, no flight goes to Kasauli.

1199
01:20:43,664 --> 01:20:45,565
Okay, how much money does
one need to return from there?

1200
01:20:45,597 --> 01:20:47,498
Sir, when the flight doesn't
go there, how would it return?

1201
01:20:47,697 --> 01:20:49,165
l am asking you the same question.

1202
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:52,232
lt is your job to book a ticket.
It is not my job.

1203

1209
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:12,700
Jhandulal Tyagi.

1210
01:21:12,764 --> 01:21:14,365
There's lot of confusion.

1211
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:18,165
So friends, that was Jhandulal
Tyagi for all of you and now..

1212
01:21:18,197 --> 01:21:20,365
..let's move on to the contest.

1213
01:21:20,697 --> 01:21:22,165
The question of today's contest is..

1214
01:21:22,497 --> 01:21:24,165
Why can't we deal with
our personal life and..

1215
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:26,231
..professional life differently?

1216
01:21:41,164 --> 01:21:43,299
'The show timings for
Shanaya and me are different..

1217
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:46,299
..but we always try to
have lunch together# 

1218
01:21:46,831 --> 01:21:48,132
'Today, l couldn't find her# 

1219
01:21:49,197 --> 01:21:50,498
'When l asked the office guys,
they told me that..

1220
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,099
..Shanaya was on the terrace# 

1221
01:21:53,564 --> 01:21:56,767
'When l reached there,
l saw Shanaya crying# 

1222
01:22:00,831 --> 01:22:02,499
'She saw me and was
about to leave from there# 

1223
01:22:03,097 --> 01:22:06,099
'When l asked the reason of her
crying to the marketing guys..

1224
01:22:06,164 --> 01:22:08,165
..they said Shanaya
was a 'Selfish woman# 

1225
01:22:08,230 --> 01:22:10,098
'And that was it. l lost my cool# 

1226
01:22:11,497 --> 01:22:19,104
Can't forget it. l can't stay
with you. l can't forget you.

1227
01:22:21,297 --> 01:22:24,299
Sometimes close and sometimes apart.

1228
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:26,632
l am like a loser.

1229
01:22:26,697 --> 01:22:29,433
Sometimes cheerful
and sometimes sad.

1230
01:22:29,497 --> 01:22:32,299
l am iust roaming about.

1231
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:36,301
Beloved, you mean the world to me.

1232
01:22:40,097 --> 01:22:41,431
Shanaya wants to quit the show.

1233
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:47,233
But she is a star RJ now.
How can we just let her go?

1234
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:50,031
'Negotiation, bribe, ,punishment,
spying.

1235
01:22:50,097 --> 01:22:51,698
You know what l mean? She cannot go.

1236
01:22:54,164 --> 01:22:57,534
And those guys. They were
just doing their job, Vivan.

1237
01:22:59,230 --> 01:23:00,297
You misunderstood them.

1238
01:23:01,431 --> 01:23:04,033
Shanaya wasn't crying
because somebody said..

1239
01:23:04,097 --> 01:23:07,033
..something to her, but
because she used to think..

1240
01:23:07,097 --> 01:23:10,033
..we were one big family. We
are a family and Shanaya..

1241
01:23:10,097 --> 01:23:12,699
..was leaving us.

1242
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:19,569
Do you understand? Don't worry,
Vivan. We'll not let her go.

1243
01:23:20,297 --> 01:23:22,699
Whether she leaves or not..
l don't care about it.

1244
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:27,231
You love her, man.

1245
01:23:27,564 --> 01:23:30,533
Whether you care for her
or not. You love her, Vivan.

1246
01:23:37,697 --> 01:23:42,034
To hell with you.
- Hey, come on, Vivan!

1247
01:23:43,497 --> 01:23:47,968
Hi, l am yours and
only yours.. Vivan Shah!

1248
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:51,967
What's love? Love is..
What happened to me.

1249
01:23:52,164 --> 01:23:55,033
But whatever is in my heart,
l can't say it. Why?

1250
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:58,500
Because my past experience
doesn't go out of my mind.

1251
01:24:00,964 --> 01:24:04,267
So.. this is my denial mode.

1252
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:09,966
Vivan Shah's denial mode.

..of this problem..
they are pressurizing me.

1322
01:31:20,164 --> 01:31:23,233
Because Shanaya is
going to sign off today.

1323
01:31:23,697 --> 01:31:24,831
She doesn't want to do her show.

01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:47,097
What happened?

Shanaya wants me to tell
the truth to her parents.

1327

What's the truth? - The drama
that l did with her family members..

And Shanaya? - Poor girl,
unnecessarily l pushed her into this.

Okay fine. We'll have
a cup coffee and leave.

Life is like a radio. It makes
you listen to different tunes.

Sometimes it makes you
happy and sometimes sad.

1336

lt makes you sentimental
sometimes and sometimes mad.

1337

Life is like a radio. It makes
you listen to different tunes.

Either you fall in love or
you don't. Why get confused?

1348

We are close to God.
We are innocent.

Should we fall in love or not?
- Please, go ahead.

1352
01:34:11,631 --> 01:34:13,899
lf the other person
doesn't love you, then?

1353
01:34:13,964 --> 01:34:15,365
Then love your neighbor.

1354
01:34:15,697 --> 01:34:17,899
lf not the neighbor, love
the one who's behind you.

1355
01:34:18,831 --> 01:34:21,366
There must be someone for sure.

1356
01:34:21,431 --> 01:34:24,367
ls it so simple to
forget your first love?

1357
01:34:24,631 --> 01:34:26,366
lf it is not easy,
then make it easy.

1358
01:34:27,764 --> 01:34:29,899
lf you want to cry, hide your tears.

1359
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:36,369
Smile.. because the one you love..
think about him too.

1360
01:34:37,397 --> 01:34:39,565
Even he would be in
Iove with someone else.

1361
01:34:42,697 --> 01:34:45,299
lf you don't move away
from his eyes..

1362
01:34:45,364 --> 01:34:47,766
..it means that your
Iove is not true.

1363
01:34:49,697 --> 01:34:52,699
lf it doesn't work this way..
eat Kurkure (snacks)

1364
01:34:52,764 --> 01:35:02,507
Life is like a radio. It makes
you listen to different tunes.

1365
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:07,832
l want to go.
- What?

1366
01:35:09,998 --> 01:35:12,767
l want to go. l want to eat Kurkure.
- What?

1367
01:35:13,697 --> 01:35:18,368
Kurkure?
- Yes. Because if l don't move..

1368
01:35:19,564 --> 01:35:20,631
..you wont be able to see.

1369
01:35:31,564 --> 01:35:37,703
Think love as a battlefield.
It is a game of wrestling.

1370
01:35:38,431 --> 01:35:42,268
This is wrestling of the heart.

1371
01:35:45,764 --> 01:35:50,902
The heart which loses
wins this. This is love.

1372
01:35:52,764 --> 01:35:56,767
This love is fun.

1373
01:35:58,297 --> 01:36:01,233
When l took Him from here,
wherever l kept it..

1374
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:03,632
..it didn't look good.

1375
01:36:05,631 --> 01:36:07,232
Everyone has their own choice.

1376
01:36:08,898 --> 01:36:14,236
His place is here. Your
place is somewhere else.

1377
01:36:14,931 --> 01:36:16,265
Pooia, don't talk in riddles?

1378
01:36:17,264 --> 01:36:19,699
Those puzzles which you
don't want to solve at all.

1379
01:36:19,764 --> 01:36:22,233
Because you're an
idiot and l haven't come..

1380
01:36:22,297 --> 01:36:24,432
..across an idiot like
you in my whole life.

1381
01:36:30,431 --> 01:36:36,503
Okay.. will you answer
one simple question?

1382
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:49,203
Do you love me? Now?

1383
01:36:49,798 --> 01:37:00,241
Life is like a radio. It makes
you listen to different tunes.

1384
01:37:10,564 --> 01:37:12,699
Hit this ball if you can.
- Here, l hit it.

1385
01:37:13,164 --> 01:37:15,432
This is a broken ball.
You talk rubbish.

1386
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:17,332
Your ball is not good.
- l want to do bat ting now.

1387
01:37:17,397 --> 01:37:20,299
Let's play again.
- No, not out. - Out! Out!

1388
01:37:20,364 --> 01:37:25,168
No.. l don't think l am out.
- l am falling.

1389
01:37:25,230 --> 01:37:27,332
Play with me.
- l fell because of you.

1390
01:37:29,831 --> 01:37:32,400
Come on, there..
- That side.

1391
01:37:32,464 --> 01:37:34,232
Enough. l'll do the batting now.

1392
01:37:34,297 --> 01:37:35,564
lt looks good.

1393
01:37:36,164 --> 01:37:38,165
lt's come.
- It's come!

1394
01:37:43,564 --> 01:37:46,266
Enough! Enough!
- Its come!

1395
01:37:46,330 --> 01:37:47,464
Enough! Enough!

1396
01:37:47,764 --> 01:37:49,699
Enough! Enough! Same! Same!

1397
01:37:49,764 --> 01:37:53,734
Hey, are you out of your mind!
Do it again! - Do it again!

1398
01:37:53,831 --> 01:37:55,799
Start it again!

1399
01:37:56,731 --> 01:38:00,634
Yes! It went off again!
- It went off again!

1400
01:38:00,697 --> 01:38:02,598
Go and tell him to do it properly!

1401
01:38:03,164 --> 01:38:05,833
Brother-in-law! - Bloody,

1402
01:38:09,431 --> 01:38:11,499
Has it come?
- No, brother-in-law.

1403
01:38:11,564 --> 01:38:13,732
Do it properly.
- Vivan, didn't you tell them?

1404
01:38:14,164 --> 01:38:16,633
No. Has it come?
- No, brother-in-law.

1405
01:38:16,697 --> 01:38:18,598
Please, Vivan. You're
not trying to understand.

1406
01:38:18,664 --> 01:38:21,566
They've called the priest. Please!

1407
01:38:21,631 --> 01:38:23,165
Stop this game now.

1408
01:38:23,431 --> 01:38:25,533
Has it come?
- No, brother-in-law.

1409
01:38:29,731 --> 01:38:34,502
Priest? Evening? The priest
had come, and he left. - What?

1410
01:38:35,164 --> 01:38:37,366
lt will be on the second.
After three months.

1411
01:38:38,197 --> 01:38:40,265
l told them,
l can't wait so muchlong.

1412
01:38:40,397 --> 01:38:42,532
l've been shouting
forom souch a long time.

1413
01:38:42,597 --> 01:38:46,033
Son-in-law, you're too much.
You spoke like a transistor.

1414
01:38:46,097 --> 01:38:48,766
You showed me all the
channels of the world, except India.

1415
01:38:49,697 --> 01:38:52,533
Papa, l am trying to. l am
not a dish antenna mechanic.

1416
01:38:52,597 --> 01:38:56,233
l am an RJ. - RJ or DJ,
you couldn't repair my TV.

1417
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:58,065
Vivan please. Stop all this now.

1418
01:38:58,164 --> 01:38:59,231
Enough is enough.

1419
01:38:59,264 --> 01:39:00,565
You don't know what
and when to speak.

1420
01:39:00,631 --> 01:39:02,432
'My confusion was over# 

1421
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:09,234
'The damage that was caused by
judge's hammer had resolved# 

1422
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:12,198
'l was standing on father-in-law's
slippery ladder steps# 

1423
01:39:13,264 --> 01:39:14,531
'Shanaya was standing
in front of me# 

1424
01:39:15,531 --> 01:39:17,099
'l had a song on my lips# 

1425
01:39:18,097 --> 01:39:25,671
''l fell in love with
you at the first sight.''

1426
01:39:26,564 --> 01:39:34,638
''Shanaya, l was lost in myself.''

1427
01:39:35,063 --> 01:39:42,770
''lt was love, but wasn't love.
l was in my denial mode.''

1428
01:39:43,531 --> 01:39:51,505
''l was angry with life.
It was since years.''

1429
01:39:52,097 --> 01:39:55,433
''l was in love,
but didn't reveal it.''

1430
01:39:56,030 --> 01:39:59,767
''l was happy, but l made you cry.''

1431
01:40:00,364 --> 01:40:08,238
''So, l tell you.. my beloved.
Yes, l love you.''

1432
01:40:09,431 --> 01:40:15,069
''l shiver from only one problem.''

1433
01:40:15,364 --> 01:40:22,104
''Change this dish
antenna of your father's.''

1434
01:40:52,697 --> 01:40:54,632
What happened?
Why are you crying now?

1435
01:40:56,497 --> 01:40:57,631
They are tears of happiness.

1436
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:03,198
You didn't propose to me till now.

1437
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:05,698
l did iust now, on the ladder.

1438
01:41:06,164 --> 01:41:08,332
l want you to say it
properly say, l love you.

1439
01:41:11,597 --> 01:41:14,099
l love you.
- Thank you.

1440
01:41:14,998 --> 01:41:17,166
You told said it very soon.
- Not very soon.

1441
01:41:19,964 --> 01:41:21,699
Can l ask you a serious question?
- Yes.

1442
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:25,698
Why did you take so much time?

1443
01:41:31,531 --> 01:41:34,967
How could l hav've said that?
l wanted to come to you..

1444
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:37,966
..without any baggage.

1445
01:41:45,397 --> 01:41:48,900
Shanaya, there are some
relationships, which don't..

1446
01:41:48,931 --> 01:41:51,233
..end even after they are broken.

1447
01:41:53,497 --> 01:41:57,534
A relationship needs
closure even after it has ended.

1448
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:03,900
When Pooia divorced me..

1449
01:42:03,964 --> 01:42:09,135
our relationship
didn't finish completely.

1450
01:42:12,964 --> 01:42:17,635
There was something left,
which has ended completely today.

1451
01:42:20,931 --> 01:42:26,903
When Pooja asked me, 'Do
you love me?' and then..

1452
01:42:26,964 --> 01:42:32,903
..she asked me, now.. l
didn't have any answer.

1453
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:40,836
lt is true that when Pooja
divorced me and then came into..

1454
01:42:40,898 --> 01:42:48,572
..my life again, then our
relationship became more complicated.

1455
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:51,365
l was confused, very confused.

1456
01:42:54,264 --> 01:42:58,568
l knew that l was in love with you,
but was scared to tell you.

1457
01:43:01,431 --> 01:43:03,566
l didn't have the guts
to get wounded hurt again.

1458
01:43:04,898 --> 01:43:09,969
Now do you have the guts?
- l love you.

1459
01:43:14,164 --> 01:43:18,568
Never leave me.
- Never. Never.

1460
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:30,864

Who'll drop them to the school?

1472
01:43:55,097 --> 01:43:58,767
There's a lot of confusion.
Too much.

1473
01:44:02,998 --> 01:44:06,801
''Let the radio of the mind,
play on.''

1474
01:44:07,764 --> 01:44:11,501
''Forget pain and live on.''

1475
01:44:29,898 --> 01:44:30,999
''Radio.''

1476
01:44:33,764 --> 01:44:34,798
''Radio.''

1477
01:44:36,798 --> 01:44:37,932
''Radio of the mind.''

1478
01:44:40,697 --> 01:44:41,764
''Radio.''

1479
01:44:43,764 --> 01:44:47,167
''Let the radio of the mind,

1480
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:50,833
''Forget pain and live on.''

''Tune into some new station.''

''Full on attitude, be on the roll.''

1483
01:44:57,931 --> 01:45:03,102
''What will happen if
the heart breaks?''

1484
01:45:05,197 --> 01:45:11,002
''Whatever has to
happen has happened.''

1485
01:45:12,764 --> 01:45:16,033
''Sing old songs and forget.''

1486
01:45:16,097 --> 01:45:19,867
''Swing on your tune.''

1487
01:45:19,931 --> 01:45:24,335
