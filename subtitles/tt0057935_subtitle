1
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:01,563
Brojo?

2
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:14,721
Brojo?
Brojo!

3
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:15,802
I'm coming.

4
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:19,442
Are you deaf? It's past four.
Take the master his tea.

5
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:34,805
Ay... hush.

6
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:53,158
Bankim... Bankim...

7
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:55,880
KAPAALKUNDALA

8
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:41,197
I've had a letter from Umapada,
your brother. Did you know?

9
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:42,600
No.

10
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:44,877
He hasn't written to you?

11
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:47,316
When did dada ever write to me.

12
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,646
You know, he hasn't been
doing too well as a lawyer.

13
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:58,163
He's written to ask if I could
find him something here.

14
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:02,477
And, I was thinking,
I could do with a manager.

15
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:05,603
You know what a mess
I make of figures.

16
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:08,842
Would dada be able to do it?

17
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:12,766
Why not? It's not difficult...
and I'll be there.

18
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,240
He couldn't put his mind
to anything, really.

19
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:18,720
He will.

20
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:21,122
I've already written
and asked him to come.

21
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:26,160
How can you judge
unless you give him responsibility?

22
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,879
- Have some more lunch?
- No.

23
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:30,324
You hardly eat anything.

24
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:33,517
The less I eat,
the more I can work, Charu.

25
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:39,597
No other way of keeping
the paper going.

26
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:43,042
OK...

27
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:49,716
Am I a lazy good for nothing?

28
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,564
Whoever said so?

29
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:55,236
That's what they call us -
the idle rich.

30
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:57,357
I want to prove them wrong.

31
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:01,401
Money doesn't have to mean
laziness, does it?

32
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:09,162
You don't have any regrets, do you?

33
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:11,922
Why?

34
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:15,679
I'm spending so much money
on the paper.

35
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:20,926
Just the other day,
I bought a new press...

36
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,844
What about it?

37
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:27,005
You're doing such good work,
getting yourself talked about...

38
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,436
After all, we're not going to starve.

39
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:33,319
You have to hear
Suren Banerjee speak, Charu.

40
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:40,402
One day, I'll explain all these
political things to you.

41
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:42,039
Really, I will.

42
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:50,276
Intellectual power may be good,
in it's own way.

43
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:55,526
But it is not intellectual
eminence that constitutes

44
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,321
individual or national greatness.

45
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:04,282
It is energy, patriotism,
devotion to duty,

46
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:07,444
the capacity for self sacrifice,

47
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,559
an unflinching regard for truth...

48
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,279
It is these...

49
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:19,637
Just a few minutes, Charu.
I know it's very late.

50
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,764
It's not that.

51
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:27,038
Here, this is for you.

52
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:34,006
You did this?

53
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:37,362
Next time, I'll embroider you
a pair of slippers.

54
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,162
How did you find the time, Charu?

55
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:45,402
You think I don't have the time?

56
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:08,682
You feel very lonely,
don't you, Charu?

57
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,677
Oh, I'm used to it, now.

58
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:21,599
Loneliness is not something
to get used to, Charu.

59
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:26,921
- Have you read Swarnalata?
- What?

60
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,241
Swarnalata?

61
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:34,804
Why are you laughing?

62
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:39,836
Nothing.

63
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,162
Charu...

64
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:57,837
I've got my Charulata.
That's enough for me.

65
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:02,563
Plays, novels, poems -
no need for such things.

66
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:03,801
Understood?

67
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,924
I'll do one thing...

68
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:27,363
I'll write to your brother
and ask him to bring his wife along.

69
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:28,965
Right?

70
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:31,237
Then you won't be lonely any more.

71
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,202
Club.

72
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:41,282
Heart.

73
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:43,562
Club.

74
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:45,922
Diamond.

75
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:48,596
Diamond?

76
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:50,642
Diamond!

77
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:53,477
Go on. Play.

78
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:56,802
Heart.

79
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:00,326
Diamond.

80
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,402
Heart.

81
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:05,285
Spade.

82
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:07,402
Diamond.

83
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,446
Go on, play.

84
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:13,920
Ice cream!

85
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:16,322
Forget the ice cream.
Play now.

86
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,036
Spade!

87
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:25,996
Play.

88
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:29,323
Didn't I say you couldn't
win with me?

89
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,927
All luck and no brains
in this game.

90
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,800
Willpower does it,
willpower.

91
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:39,363
I'm always telling my husband -
if you only had willpower.

92
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,156
Club.

93
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,082
Club.

94
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:49,356
Spade.

95
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:52,800
Heart.

96
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,201
Spade.

97
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:58,326
Diamond.

98
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,319
Heart.

99
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:05,399
Club.

100
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:08,645
Heart.

101
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,683
Come on, now.

102
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,887
Oh no!

103
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:26,400
Help me now,
oh God!

104
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,199
Oh no!

105
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:33,398
Now there are just three cards left.

106
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,875
Come on, now.

107
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:41,404
Oh no!

108
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:52,686
Oh no!

109
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,237
So much for your willpower!

110
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:03,165
It's gone four. Could you ask
Brojo to take the tea?

111
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,242
Brojo!

112
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:06,801
- Oh, you...
- All right, I'm going. I'm going.

113
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:10,442
Your Brojo must be going deaf.

114
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:15,921
Brojo.

115
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,597
Take some tea to the master.

116
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:34,565
Charu...

117
00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:37,404
a storm is coming.

118
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,839
Get everything, quick.

119
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:20,519
Glory be to God!

120
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:28,524
Is everyone OK?

121
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,559
- Were you supposed to come today?
- Where's Bhupati?

122
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:33,677
- Downstairs working.
- Paper's still going strong?

123
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:35,445
Bless the Lord!

124
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:42,645
- What are you doing down there?
- All these proof sheets...

125
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:43,722
Good heavens!

126
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,637
It is you.
How come you're here?

127
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,155
I'd have been here earlier
but for mother.

128
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:51,880
- And how is Aunty?
- Fine. Whose tea is this?

129
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:53,599
Go on. Have it.

130
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:55,638
Have you got them all?

131
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,317
Tell Brojo to bring
one more cup of tea.

132
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:03,955
So, then...

133
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:14,279
- So tell me... what are your plans?
- To accept your generous hospitality.

134
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:16,397
That's my plan. What's yours?

135
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:17,482
Mine...

136
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,084
relaxation.

137
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,846
Second, literary endeavour.
And third...

138
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:24,286
Third what?

139
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:27,196
Third... relaxation.

140
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,279
No, no. That won't do.

141
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:34,205
That second relaxation has to go.

142
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,443
There's work for you.

143
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:42,320
Work?
Oh, that cursed word!

144
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,358
See what you'll get if you don't.
Come on.

145
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:45,999
- Where?
- Come and see my press.

146
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:47,082
Oh!

147
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:50,357
What? You here too?

148
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:54,036
Umapada's not like you.
He works for the Sentinel.

149
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,203
Come.
We'll just be back.

150
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,721
Very easy work.
Two hours proofreading a day.

151
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,679
Oh my God! I don't even know
how many "I"s there are in height.

152
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:08,958
Don't worry. There's only
political news in my paper.

153
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,804
Just pass me a copy.

154
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:16,962
Here. Twenty fourth issue
of the Sentinel.

155
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:20,556
Dated, April the 9th, 1879.

156
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:23,717
Careful, careful.
It might still be wet.

157
00:21:25,807 --> 00:21:27,798
Wonderful name, I must say.

158
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:30,805
That is Nishikanta's idea.
The motto is mine.

159
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:32,681
Truth survives.

160
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,284
But will the paper survive?

161
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,000
But you missed the main thing -
my editorial.

162
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:46,556
What's this?
You're criticising the Government?

163
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:47,881
Why not?

164
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,957
Why not, Amal?

165
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:54,601
Why is the Government carrying on
the Afghan campaign?

166
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,435
I'll tell you, the prestige of
England in Europe is at stake.

167
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:01,081
So, why should India
bear the cost of it?

168
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:02,276
Why?

169
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:04,204
Shouldn't we condemn them?

170
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,397
Shouldn't we condemn
the Press Act too?

171
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:09,564
Three years now,
they haven't changed it.

172
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:11,677
And what about
the signature misuse?

173
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:15,800
What about the Arm's Act?
The Salt Tax? The Rent Tax?

174
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:20,595
All right, the British Government
is running the country.

175
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:24,925
Fine. But... in this business
of running the country

176
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,037
why don't the Indians get a say?

177
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:29,476
Why? Because there
is no representation.

178
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:33,486
I have exposed all this.
Is that a crime?

179
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:35,802
And what if the police arrest you?

180
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:39,396
Why? To be outspoken is not
necessarily to be disloyal?

181
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:44,757
Oh my God!
I don't want to be involved in all this.

182
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:52,242
The tram was a mess today.
The horse went wild.

183
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,120
Did you get any advertisements?

184
00:22:57,287 --> 00:23:00,006
Only one. Holloways Pills.

185
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:04,359
Three months contract.
Because I went personally.

186
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:08,241
Bathgate, Stanistreet...
none of the big chemists?

187
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:12,797
- We must bring down our rates.
- Why?

188
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:18,160
It's a new paper.
Not many subscribers.

189
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:20,277
No prestige yet.

190
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:24,366
How can you ask the same
rates as Suren Banerjee?

191
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:31,003
Besides, it's a political paper.

192
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:33,998
No pep, no laughs.

193
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:36,798
How can you make it pay
without all that?

194
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:40,840
What do you mean by "all that"?
Tit-bits? Spicy news?

195
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,037
All the scandals of the street?

196
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:45,601
No, Umapada. No.

197
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:47,802
No.

198
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:54,200
- I would sooner give it all up.
- But I want a kick out of my job.

199
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:57,284
I wouldn't be surprised
if this ship sinks.

200
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:10,036
It won't sink, Umapada.
Not with me at the helm.

201
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:14,444
And you know what the bearings are?
Our paper's truth. Integrity.

202
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,560
All right. You get on with it, then.

203
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:26,319
What are you saying, Umapada?

204
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:29,803
These days even a destitute widow
can hold her head up high.

205
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:33,203
And you think we can't keep
the paper going? But, yes.

206
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:36,205
The only way is
the way of honesty.

207
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:38,841
What you are suggesting
is not honest, Umapada.

208
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:40,684
It's the way of prostitution.

209
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:48,157
So, what am I supposed to do?

210
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:59,875
Why is it that you have
no enthusiasm for the paper?

211
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:08,245
I think it is because you have
no responsibility. Isn't it?

212
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:25,606
What is this?

213
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:29,401
The keys.

214
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:33,961
From now on,
you handle the money, completely.

215
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:39,161
And advertisement rates are one anna less.
Lets see if we can keep it going or not.

216
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,324
Look, Umapada...

217
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:50,037
Do you know what
this paper means to me?

218
00:25:50,647 --> 00:25:53,115
It's your sister's rival.

219
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:58,607
But don't tell Charulata.

220
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:06,837
Every flower and every branch

221
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:11,438
Sways softly with the gentle breeze

222
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:15,116
On the beach, the waves rock...

223
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,158
Is the room all right for you?

224
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:21,042
Charu...

225
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:28,963
since my hostel life,
I haven't seen such luxury.

226
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:31,086
Now, enjoy it.

227
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:34,563
Now, your student life is over.

228
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:38,119
You've become so thin.

229
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:47,006
You still sing?

230
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,200
You'll never change!

231
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:00,477
- Charu...
- What?

232
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:03,918
I want to do something.

233
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:06,844
Give me some ideas.

234
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:10,482
I know of one thing
that needs to be done.

235
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:12,643
- What?
- Marriage.

236
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:17,121
Don't you women ever...

237
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:20,762
- What's this? How are you here?
- Why? Didn't you see my husband?

238
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,923
So if your husband's here,
you have to be here too?

239
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:24,195
Yes.

240
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:34,644
Are you hungry?

241
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:39,758
Hey, thee triangular piece of food,

242
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:41,479
I'm going to...

243
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:01,202
The samosas are very nice.

244
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,839
She made them?

245
00:28:02,887 --> 00:28:04,923
Why?
I couldn't have made them?

246
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:07,401
- No.
- Why?

247
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:18,646
If you'd made them,
Manda would not have brought me so many.

248
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:23,044
Women don't understand
women's psychology.

249
00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:24,566
Men do.

250
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:25,926
Enough now.

251
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:28,356
Give me your shirt now.

252
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:29,886
Which one?

253
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:32,395
The one you're wearing.

254
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:36,520
There's a tear in it so big
four samosas could fit into it.

255
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,156
Oh!

256
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:50,801
If there are more torn clothes in your box,
give them to me.

257
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:53,884
In the hostel,
we did all these things ourselves.

258
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:55,918
This isn't your hostel.

259
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:12,916
I'm leaving the city of Luck now...

260
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:16,039
Oh my! Your press is amazing!

261
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,124
Here, teachers demand work
even from the back benchers.

262
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:20,961
Thank you.

263
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:25,197
- Is it all right?
- Very good.

264
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:30,482
Dada, do you get
the Sororuha magazine?

265
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:34,439
I get all kinds of things.
But you won't find it here.

266
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:37,957
Have a look in the drawing room

267
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:40,567
where Charulata is
always roaming about.

268
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:42,677
I see you don't much care for...

269
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:45,799
All these delights are not for me.

270
00:29:57,567 --> 00:30:00,479
Sloppy tragedies
modern writers come out with!

271
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:08,277
So, you don't think much of them.

272
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:18,484
Nishikanta once told me,

273
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,517
after reading one of Bankim's novels

274
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,797
he couldn't sleep for three nights.

275
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:28,319
So, I said to him,
you must be crazy.

276
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:32,838
A healthy fellow like you
with seven hours of sleep

277
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:37,881
and a novel comes along
and messes it all up.

278
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:39,918
And, you allow it?

279
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:46,000
Dada, suppose the Government
comes up with a new tax tomorrow.

280
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:48,837
Will you still get sleep at night?

281
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:03,806
Amal, politics is different.

282
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:07,242
Politics is a living thing.

283
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:09,721
Real. Palpable.

284
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,156
When the Government
imposes a new tax,

285
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:15,119
and, it's happening all
the time with Lord Lytton,

286
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,158
we can see before our very eyes

287
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:20,358
how the people of
a poor country get affected,

288
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:22,716
how they suffer!

289
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:28,125
Is this a bigger tragedy
or is it Romeo and Juliet?

290
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,037
The Queen will be saved all right.

291
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:48,716
But, who's going to save
the people of Bengal?

292
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:52,919
All this sloppy literature is
ruining the people.

293
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:55,276
We must do something about it.

294
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:58,364
We must be strong, physically.

295
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:00,637
We can't get by on brains alone.

296
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,279
Of course not.

297
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:06,797
- Do you do club swinging?
- Just feel and see.

298
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,395
- How old are you?
- 23.

299
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,563
I'm 35. Come, let's see.

300
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:17,917
What?
Elbows on the table?

301
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,958
One, two, three.

302
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:42,356
Go to bed now.

303
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,161
Hey!

304
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:57,884
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

305
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:03,637
I think Charu has a literary bent.

306
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:10,001
She's always reading magazines
and things. Anything in Bengali.

307
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:16,282
The trouble is,
I can't spare any time to guide her.

308
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:20,525
But, I think she has talent.
She writes well.

309
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,400
When I was in Monghyr,
she wrote me letters.

310
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:26,086
She has a beautiful style.

311
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:30,996
The thing is,
whatever talent she has

312
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:33,800
you can help bring it out.

313
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:38,682
Give her some of your time.
Guide her. Make her write.

314
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:43,243
If she really has some talent,
it should not be wasted.

315
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:46,606
Start from tomorrow.

316
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:51,245
But, one thing -
she mustn't suspect anything.

317
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:54,597
Then she'd only resist
and go back into her shell.

318
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:58,197
What kind of tax is this?

319
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:01,239
I thought I was going to write
and now you want me to...

320
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:05,195
Do both. You're up to it.

321
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:06,919
I trust you.

322
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,446
Good night.

323
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:25,525
Oh my! How beautiful!

324
00:34:26,687 --> 00:34:29,485
Charulata! Hey!

325
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:34,123
Oh, shut up.
You're putting me off.

326
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,283
Why? What are you doing
that's so special?

327
00:34:36,327 --> 00:34:40,366
It's not what I'm doing -
I'm thinking too and you're disturbing.

328
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:44,116
However much you concentrate...

329
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,202
Oh baba.

330
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:48,796
You cannot turn the tide of fate

331
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:50,041
Are you in fancy dress?

332
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,203
Kindly, fair lady.
Prepare a paan for me

333
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:54,044
No sir, not for you.

334
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:01,086
- And, what's this?
- Slippers for the master.

335
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:04,802
Dada is so lucky

336
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:09,395
You'll be lucky too

337
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:11,244
What? Slippers for me?

338
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:13,804
A wife for you.

339
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:20,357
Where have you been?

340
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,962
To the shop to buy
myself a notebook.

341
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:28,362
And that makes you so tired?

342
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:32,320
Would you like to sleep?
Want a pillow?

343
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:34,505
Finished exams, studies,

344
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:38,602
finished cutting classes,
finished professors.

345
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:40,524
Anything not finished?

346
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:43,127
Finished fooling about?
Finished knowing everything?

347
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:46,995
Poetry.

348
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:49,675
Rhythm.

349
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:58,400
You know, Charu,
I was thinking...

350
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:00,840
What?

351
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:04,084
Life is a rhythm.

352
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:07,887
Birth. Death.

353
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,486
Day. Night.

354
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:14,761
Happiness. Grief.

355
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:18,605
Meeting. Parting.

356
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:21,482
Like the waves of the ocean.

357
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:25,796
Now up. Now down.

358
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:28,725
You can't have one
without the other.

359
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,359
Don't you agree?

360
00:36:31,447 --> 00:36:33,722
Are you going to write all
that in your notebook?

361
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:36,446
Thank you.

362
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:38,557
How about a game of cards?

363
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:42,524
- Did you see if the washing's dry?
- Not yet.

364
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,159
Shall we play?

365
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:49,444
Manda, are you a Modern
or a Conservative?

366
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:51,762
Are you going to play?
Or else I'll put the cards away.

367
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:54,241
Yesterday the queen of spades
slipped under the pillow.

368
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:55,561
Listen.

369
00:36:58,487 --> 00:37:03,356
"Any woman spending her time
reclining on the bed

370
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:06,444
"gasping into the mirror,
arranging her hair

371
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:10,924
"embroidering carpets,
reading novels

372
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:14,164
"only concerned about
her own well being

373
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:17,279
"may indeed be somewhat
superior to an animal.

374
00:37:17,327 --> 00:37:20,000
"But she has little justification
for being born a woman.

375
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:22,356
"We humbly suggest that
a woman of this category

376
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,558
"should put a rope around her neck
and hang herself. "

377
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:27,404
Are you of this category?

378
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:32,723
Do I embroider carpets?
Do I read novels? You know I can't.

379
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:35,804
- Then you are a Conservative?
- I don't know.

380
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:40,443
Conservative woman, leave this room.
We are about to discuss literature.

381
00:37:43,607 --> 00:37:45,484
- Go.
- No, I won't.

382
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:47,719
All right, stay.

383
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:21,759
- Have you read Manmatha Dutta?
- No.

384
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,037
- Have you?
- Yes.

385
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,240
- Lonesome melodies?
- Loathsome melodies.

386
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:34,836
- "Lonesome" melodies.
- Loathsome melodies.

387
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:39,403
- I read it in last month's Sororuha.
- You don't like Manmatha Dutta?

388
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:46,565
No taste. It must improve.

389
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:51,398
Who do you like then?

390
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:56,165
- Bankim Babu.
- Bankim Babu!

391
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:00,238
Where's your originality?

392
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:05,042
How can I be original, Amal?
I don't know such a lot.

393
00:39:05,087 --> 00:39:07,476
I simply said what I liked.

394
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:11,160
I find him difficult in places.

395
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:13,880
And I have to use the dictionary.

396
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:19,199
And my! What descriptions!
Especially of the women.

397
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:22,036
All the women are beautiful.

398
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:24,681
They're so perfect,
they make me uncomfortable.

399
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:29,077
They are all beautiful.

400
00:39:30,647 --> 00:39:33,525
Mrinalini's beautiful,
Radharani's beautiful,

401
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:36,639
Saibalini's beautiful,
Kapal Kundela's beautiful...

402
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:38,086
And Kunda?

403
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:41,042
Kunda's also beautiful,
but not perfect.

404
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:47,162
Lufunnisa's not perfect either -
too tall, thin lips...

405
00:39:47,207 --> 00:39:49,721
- And a dark complexion.
- Yes. And...

406
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,798
Look at the conservative woman.

407
00:39:57,847 --> 00:40:00,725
You mentioned Bankim
and she started snoring.

408
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:07,244
Just do one thing.
Just pick up that mat.

409
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:08,322
Mat?

410
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:14,238
Come here, Amal.

411
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:36,197
What a mess the garden is in!

412
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:41,798
And dada wanted to make
a Japanese garden here!

413
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:46,645
You know your brother.
He only thinks office paper.

414
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:56,087
A pond here.

415
00:40:56,127 --> 00:40:59,119
A few lotuses. Some ducks.

416
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:01,485
A bridge.

417
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:04,523
And flowers on each side.

418
00:41:06,287 --> 00:41:09,836
No peacocks?
To spread their plumes and dance?

419
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:13,596
No peacocks. No.
No screeching.

420
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,564
It's too disturbing.

421
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:20,396
It would be nice to have
some deer, though.

422
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:25,837
You could write a whole Rubaiyat here.

423
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:31,078
Amal. Hey Amal.

424
00:41:34,607 --> 00:41:36,723
Give me a push, will you?

425
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:41,204
Just once,
then I will keep it going.

426
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:46,644
Modern woman,
this is going too far.

427
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:49,281
What, young sir?
What's going too far?

428
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:57,966
Do you know they're putting
a tax on swinging?

429
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:11,879
Gently, gently, sway the flowers

430
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:19,720
Softly, softly, blows the breeze

431
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:27,757
Gaily, gaily, runs the river

432
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:35,677
Flowing with a gentle ease

433
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:44,162
From the tree tops, young and green

434
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:52,157
The cuckoo calls, "Hello, hello"

435
00:42:53,167 --> 00:43:01,165
Why my heart is filled with sadness

436
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:09,285
Tell me, tell me, I don't know

437
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,160
Amal...

438
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:20,966
Hey, Mr Clever!

439
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:24,246
What are you thinking of?

440
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:26,521
Just thinking.

441
00:43:27,127 --> 00:43:28,276
What?

442
00:43:28,927 --> 00:43:30,326
About writing.

443
00:43:30,927 --> 00:43:32,360
Writing what?

444
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:34,241
I'm thinking.

445
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:35,922
What?

446
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:37,881
I'm thinking.

447
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:43,965
Good, but don't just think.
Think and write.

448
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:47,281
But not in that notebook.
I'll make you one.

449
00:43:57,127 --> 00:43:59,197
One inkpot and one pen.

450
00:44:00,927 --> 00:44:03,680
SHRI AMAL KUMAR BASU

451
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:18,517
Hail thou, virgin page!

452
00:44:19,247 --> 00:44:22,159
My imagination has yet not
stained thy purity.

453
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:27,485
The day when I reach the last page
and write that last line...

454
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:30,477
when will it come?

455
00:44:30,527 --> 00:44:32,995
Good Lord! What magic there is
in my notebook!

456
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:35,356
The moment you hold it,
you're in spirit.

457
00:44:43,927 --> 00:44:46,521
- But you must promise me one thing.
- What?

458
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:50,440
Whatever you write
stays in that book.

459
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:53,797
It won't be published.

460
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:56,725
- All right?
- All right.

461
00:45:02,927 --> 00:45:05,202
New Night

462
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:11,361
The beautiful evening...

463
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:16,361
in August...

464
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:30,037
The tainted sun...

465
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:41,285
At the time when all old memories...

466
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:43,124
You missed an accent.

467
00:45:45,127 --> 00:45:46,640
Thank you.

468
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:56,280
Thank you, thank you, thank you...

469
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:49,282
Done.

470
00:47:51,527 --> 00:47:54,803
End of the essay,
end of the book.

471
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:58,878
Now write a story.

472
00:47:58,927 --> 00:48:00,918
Why? You think an essay is no good?

473
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:05,882
Listen.

474
00:48:07,127 --> 00:48:09,402
"Even as Prince Abhimanyu,
while still in the womb,

475
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:11,756
"learned only how to
penetrate the enemy ranks

476
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:14,241
"but not how to withdraw,

477
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:18,678
"so a river, emerging from
the mountain's rocky womb

478
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:22,242
"can only move forward
and knows not how to turn back.

479
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:26,325
"Oh, flow of the river!
Oh, youth.

480
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:32,078
"Oh time! Oh, world!
All you can do is advance.

481
00:48:32,127 --> 00:48:39,317
"You never look back along the path
where the golden past lies strewn.

482
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:42,803
"Only the mind of man looks back.

483
00:48:42,847 --> 00:48:46,362
"No such concern
perturbs the Universe. "

484
00:48:48,487 --> 00:48:49,681
How is it?

485
00:48:51,607 --> 00:48:54,838
Go on, say something.
I want your opinion.

486
00:48:54,887 --> 00:48:58,277
If it's good, why it's good.
If it's bad, why it's bad.

487
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:04,763
Say something. Is it bad?

488
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,035
- I don't say it's bad.
- Then?

489
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:11,562
I say that's enough of that.

490
00:49:11,607 --> 00:49:14,963
River, sky, cloud, moon...

491
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,999
Enough? There's no "enough"
in literature.

492
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:20,163
And why only write stories?

493
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,756
Addison, Steele, Emerson -
did they write stories?

494
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:26,560
All right, all right.
Write whatever you like.

495
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:31,521
No, now I won't.
It's your turn now.

496
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:32,966
Good Lord!

497
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:35,281
Why not?

498
00:49:35,927 --> 00:49:38,043
I don't get ideas like yours.

499
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:40,476
That doesn't matter.
Write your own ideas.

500
00:49:42,927 --> 00:49:49,844
Write about your childhood. Your village,
the river, the religious festivals, fairs...

501
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,718
all those things you told me about.

502
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:54,122
- No.
- Why not?

503
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:57,523
- I can't remember.
- Try and remember.

504
00:49:57,567 --> 00:50:00,718
If you don't write something,
Bhupati will want an explanation.

505
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:02,405
Explanation?

506
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:05,007
Dada will say
I'm not teaching you anything.

507
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:10,686
Oh! So, it's because of him that you...

508
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:16,120
I mean, he didn't appoint me
as your regular teacher with a salary.

509
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:18,877
Now what?
Where are you off to?

510
00:50:19,727 --> 00:50:21,445
Time for tea.

511
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:28,797
I'm going to publish my essay.

512
00:50:28,847 --> 00:50:30,838
Do what you like.

513
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:56,563
Why my heart should feel
such sadness

514
00:50:57,647 --> 00:51:02,960
Tell me, tell me, I don't know

515
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:07,562
Charu!

516
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:10,039
On the roof.

517
00:51:14,207 --> 00:51:17,995
From there, you can get a nice view
of the church tower. Go and see.

518
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,317
- No. I won't.
- Then stay.

519
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:35,885
- Do you want another paan?
- Give.

520
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:52,956
OK, Manda, what paper
shall I send my essay to?

521
00:51:53,007 --> 00:51:54,042
What?

522
00:51:54,087 --> 00:51:56,237
What paper shall I send
my essay to?

523
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,084
Good Lord!
How should I know!

524
00:51:58,127 --> 00:52:00,277
It's because you don't know
that I'm asking you.

525
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:02,397
Those who do know
can't make up their mind.

526
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:05,598
Quickly, say one or the other.
Bishwabandhu or Saroruha?

527
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:08,480
- Saro what?
- Saroruha, which means lotus.

528
00:52:08,527 --> 00:52:10,165
Say which one. Come on, quick.

529
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:11,686
Lotus!

530
00:52:11,727 --> 00:52:12,921
Right.

531
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:16,798
Bishwabandhu won't accept
articles from new writers.

532
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:18,934
Will they accept
articles from new writers?

533
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:19,680
They will.

534
00:52:19,727 --> 00:52:20,921
Good.

535
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:28,076
Blessings upon you, dear Manda.

536
00:52:28,127 --> 00:52:31,756
Blessings won't do. If I'm right,
you must give me a treat.

537
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,485
What would you like?
Cake from Pelleti or sandesh?

538
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,836
- Ice cream.
- What?

539
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:40,447
- Ice cream!
- So be it.

540
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:45,759
You didn't get the washing in.
Suppose it had rained?

541
00:52:52,727 --> 00:52:55,525
- Amal!
- Coming, dada.

542
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:59,321
Amal has started writing these days.

543
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:01,483
Have you read anything he has written?

544
00:53:02,887 --> 00:53:04,081
Charu?

545
00:53:05,087 --> 00:53:06,566
What?

546
00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:11,317
I was just wondering whether
he has any real talent

547
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:14,404
or is he just wasting time.

548
00:53:14,447 --> 00:53:18,679
There's a very good offer of marriage
come for him. From Burdwan.

549
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:20,797
Raghunath Mitra's daughter.

550
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:24,201
That's good.

551
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:27,238
- Dada?
- Ah, there you are.

552
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,482
I have still not finished the proofs...

553
00:53:29,527 --> 00:53:32,485
- Why?
- I've been doing a bit of writing myself.

554
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:34,802
- What writing?
- Nothing much. Just...

555
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,439
Go and get it.

556
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:38,637
- You'll read it?
- Yes, of course.

557
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,484
Listen, nothing sloppy, I hope.

558
00:53:40,527 --> 00:53:43,246
- No.
- Go and get it.

559
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:45,721
Go now. Run, run, run.

560
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:50,959
A good bride.
All we need is Amal's consent.

561
00:53:52,327 --> 00:53:55,683
He only needs a little pushing
and he'll be ready.

562
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,400
No question of force, here.

563
00:54:02,047 --> 00:54:03,116
Here.

564
00:54:04,927 --> 00:54:08,397
- Will you read it yourself or...
- Er... no, you read it.

565
00:54:08,447 --> 00:54:09,482
Sit.

566
00:54:12,967 --> 00:54:14,195
One minute.

567
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:33,159
Right. Go ahead.

568
00:54:33,927 --> 00:54:35,724
"Light of the Moonless Night.

569
00:54:38,047 --> 00:54:39,446
"Whenever we... "

570
00:54:39,487 --> 00:54:42,923
- Wait, what did you say?
- Light of the Moonless Night.

571
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:45,435
Light of the Moonless Night?

572
00:54:45,487 --> 00:54:46,556
Hmm.

573
00:54:46,607 --> 00:54:49,519
You've written about starlight?
Is it something scientific?

574
00:54:49,567 --> 00:54:52,320
No, dada.
I am a student of literature.

575
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:55,359
I can't write an astronomical treatise
on the moon and stars.

576
00:54:55,407 --> 00:54:57,682
Oh! So, there's no moon?

577
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,206
No.

578
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:01,238
- No stars either?
- No.

579
00:55:01,287 --> 00:55:03,881
What about the night?
No night either?

580
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,441
There is. But not your kind of night.

581
00:55:06,487 --> 00:55:07,715
Oh!

582
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:10,042
And no light, then?
Not my kind of light.

583
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:11,315
No.

584
00:55:11,967 --> 00:55:14,356
I see. I think you should get married.

585
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:15,442
Married?

586
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:22,036
There's a very good offer
from Burdwan.

587
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:25,238
Burdwan's lawyer,
Raghunath's daughter.

588
00:55:25,287 --> 00:55:27,847
Good-looking girl
and well educated too.

589
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:29,878
Tell me if you're willing.

590
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:33,286
No doubt about it. He's willing.

591
00:55:33,327 --> 00:55:36,637
How do you know? If you can't understand
my writing, how can you understand me?

592
00:55:36,687 --> 00:55:38,564
Oh, I understand.

593
00:55:38,607 --> 00:55:39,881
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

594
00:55:39,927 --> 00:55:41,155
Of course you do!

595
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:43,004
Now, stop squabbling.

596
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:48,517
I've not told you the main thing yet.

597
00:55:48,567 --> 00:55:52,879
Mr Mitra is going to send
his son-in-law to England.

598
00:55:52,927 --> 00:55:54,918
You understand? England!

599
00:55:55,407 --> 00:55:56,442
Sit.

600
00:55:57,567 --> 00:55:59,922
Sit down, Amal,
and let this sink in.

601
00:56:07,927 --> 00:56:11,761
Suppose you come back a barrister...
that wouldn't be so bad, would it?

602
00:56:11,807 --> 00:56:14,116
Just think about it.

603
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:17,284
It's a big chance, Amal. England.

604
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:21,037
The land of Shakespeare.

605
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:27,037
Why just Shakespeare?
Burke, Macaulay, Gladstone...

606
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,445
You can go and listen to
their speeches in Parliament.

607
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:35,003
You can be there in person and hear it.
I never managed it.

608
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:41,437
That's my big regret.

609
00:56:41,487 --> 00:56:44,763
Once, I got as far as
booking the passage but...

610
00:56:44,807 --> 00:56:46,684
The Isles of Greece.

611
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:48,482
Exactly.

612
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:52,246
Why just England?
The continent too.

613
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:57,077
France. Germany.
Greece. Italy.

614
00:56:57,127 --> 00:57:02,155
The land of Mazzini and Garibaldi.
You will see this all.

615
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,324
How many Bengali boys
have this opportunity?

616
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,562
Aren't you tempted?

617
00:57:07,607 --> 00:57:09,723
Mediterranean.

618
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:13,367
What a wonderful name, dada.

619
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:16,319
Like running your fingers over
the strings of the tanpura.

620
00:57:17,487 --> 00:57:19,762
Mediterranean.

621
00:57:21,247 --> 00:57:23,158
Just think, Amal.

622
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:28,235
New Years Eve -
the last decade of the 19th century.

623
00:57:28,287 --> 00:57:30,960
You hear Big Ben.

624
00:57:31,007 --> 00:57:34,920
It's snowing and you're
walking down the street.

625
00:57:34,967 --> 00:57:38,243
Overcoat, gloves...

626
00:57:38,287 --> 00:57:43,077
The confident strides of young Bengal.

627
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:46,563
Oh, if only I had your
opportunity, Amal.

628
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:52,597
Well? Ready?

629
00:57:52,647 --> 00:57:55,286
Mr Amalchandra Basu.

630
00:57:59,527 --> 00:58:00,721
All right?

631
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:02,841
Ready?

632
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:06,520
Rich streams of water,
full orchards...

633
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:09,240
cool winds of delight...

634
00:58:09,287 --> 00:58:11,562
green fields swaying...

635
00:58:12,647 --> 00:58:14,524
- Dada...
- Yes?

636
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,517
- No.
- What?

637
00:58:20,127 --> 00:58:21,321
But why?

638
00:58:22,287 --> 00:58:25,996
Our lovely Bengal!
That's the land for me

639
00:58:26,047 --> 00:58:28,197
- Good night.
- But, but...

640
00:58:28,247 --> 00:58:30,477
Bless the Lord!

641
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:34,315
- What shall I say to Mr Mitra?
- Ask for time.

642
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,756
How much? One week?

643
00:58:36,807 --> 00:58:38,604
One month!

644
00:58:38,647 --> 00:58:40,683
Did you see him?
Why are you laughing?

645
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:42,718
He wants it.

646
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:45,804
But didn't I tell you?
He won't admit it.

647
00:58:45,847 --> 00:58:50,159
No, Charu, you don't understand. This is
a great opportunity. It won't come again.

648
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:53,199
Don't worry.
Do what he is asking you to.

649
00:58:53,247 --> 00:58:57,957
Ask for the time. And in a few days,
he will say yes.

650
00:58:58,007 --> 00:59:00,077
Don't you know your own brother?

651
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:20,436
Manda.

652
00:59:21,527 --> 00:59:22,721
Yes?

653
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:23,961
Come here.

654
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:26,396
Tell me.

655
00:59:26,447 --> 00:59:27,846
No, come here.

656
00:59:34,847 --> 00:59:35,962
Come.

657
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:41,602
What?

658
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,403
- Come close.
- I am close.

659
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:46,355
Closer.

660
00:59:52,927 --> 00:59:55,680
- Look at me.
- I'm looking.

661
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:01,242
What?

662
01:00:05,047 --> 01:00:07,117
You haven't been up to anything,
have you?

663
01:00:08,047 --> 01:00:09,480
What if I have?

664
01:00:09,527 --> 01:00:13,156
You drink on the sly, don't you?

665
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,163
My Mandakini...

666
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:26,324
A good girl with a bad husband.

667
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:29,040
Why do say "bad"?

668
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:32,841
Why? Am I not bad?

669
01:00:33,447 --> 01:00:35,483
It's our luck that's bad.

670
01:00:35,527 --> 01:00:37,119
Why is it bad?

671
01:00:38,727 --> 01:00:42,720
It's bad. Otherwise why would
we have to leave our house?

672
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:49,925
Why? Don't you like it here?

673
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:52,765
How can I like it?
Besides...

674
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:55,720
Besides what?

675
01:00:58,327 --> 01:00:59,760
Besides what?

676
01:00:59,807 --> 01:01:01,479
No. Nothing.

677
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:09,320
Just two months more.

678
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:11,918
Just two months?

679
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:14,197
Just put up with it
for two months more.

680
01:01:14,247 --> 01:01:16,044
And then?

681
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:18,964
And then what?

682
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,765
What are you planning?

683
01:01:22,807 --> 01:01:25,002
Could you tell a lie for my sake?

684
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:32,956
Tell me how much you love me.

685
01:01:33,967 --> 01:01:36,765
Oh my God! What lie?

686
01:01:36,807 --> 01:01:40,322
All right, all right.
I'll make it easy for you.

687
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:43,359
I'll tell the lie
and you'll back me up.

688
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:45,875
My God, what are you up to!

689
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,405
When fate kicks you in the teeth,
hit back at those he favours.

690
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:21,805
I know you, I know you,
O fair one from afar

691
01:02:21,847 --> 01:02:30,516
Beyond the seven seas
you dwell

692
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:39,282
O fair one from afar

693
01:02:40,327 --> 01:02:42,397
So, my paan's not to be eaten?

694
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:46,036
- You won't eat it?
- No.

695
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:51,959
I saw you on an Autumn day

696
01:02:52,007 --> 01:02:56,205
And then again one night in May

697
01:02:56,247 --> 01:03:00,525
I saw you on an Autumn day

698
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:04,606
And then again one night in May

699
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:21,281
Your thoughts my heart
can ne'er dispel

700
01:03:21,327 --> 01:03:25,320
O fair one from afar

701
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:45,846
I turn my ear to the sky
And catch your song go by

702
01:03:45,887 --> 01:04:03,124
My love for you I can't deny,
O fair one from afar

703
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:19,846
I've roamed over land and sea
And come to a new place

704
01:04:19,887 --> 01:04:32,721
I seek your hospitality,
O fair one from afar

705
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:44,645
O fair one from afar,
O fair one from afar

706
01:04:44,687 --> 01:04:49,442
I know you,
I know you...

707
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:52,965
O, sweet wife of my brother

708
01:04:53,007 --> 01:04:54,042
Move.

709
01:04:59,047 --> 01:05:02,437
- What is it, Brojo?
- Letter for you.

710
01:05:02,487 --> 01:05:05,047
I've been standing here with it,
listening to your song.

711
01:05:25,407 --> 01:05:30,276
Manda, Sororuha has accepted my essay.
My essay has been accepted by Sororuha.

712
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:32,522
- Really?
- Look at this letter!

713
01:05:33,487 --> 01:05:35,079
Didn't I tell you?

714
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:36,602
Charu!

715
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:38,362
Charu!

716
01:05:42,727 --> 01:05:46,276
Charu! Charu!
Sororuha has accepted my essay.

717
01:05:46,967 --> 01:05:48,559
Stop that banging. I'm busy.

718
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:13,525
Dada!
Sororuha has accepted my essay.

719
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:17,276
- Light of the Moonless Night?
- No. Dark of the Sun.

720
01:06:18,047 --> 01:06:19,526
Good.

721
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,719
Didn't I tell you to stop banging?

722
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:27,642
Charu?

723
01:06:30,007 --> 01:06:32,805
- Charu?
- Just a moment.

724
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:35,566
What happened?

725
01:06:45,927 --> 01:06:47,997
What's the matter?
What are you doing?

726
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:49,162
Cockroach.

727
01:06:49,207 --> 01:06:51,767
- If it escapes...
- Cockroach?

728
01:06:53,407 --> 01:06:55,523
- Where did it go?
- Hmm...

729
01:06:55,567 --> 01:06:57,956
Under the bed, perhaps?

730
01:06:58,007 --> 01:06:59,406
Oh then...

731
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:10,603
You know the new news?
There's going to be an election in England.

732
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:12,763
We're all very excited.

733
01:07:14,727 --> 01:07:18,436
The party in power now -
the Tory Party -

734
01:07:18,487 --> 01:07:21,240
they'll never do India any good.

735
01:07:23,647 --> 01:07:29,244
So we all want the other party to win -
the Liberals.

736
01:07:31,487 --> 01:07:35,446
Bipin says he'll pray to Mother Kali
for their victory.

737
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:40,559
Come, then.

738
01:07:42,847 --> 01:07:46,396
Here, smell this.
Fresh from the press.

739
01:08:02,607 --> 01:08:05,485
Tell me, who'll win?
Disraeli or Gladstone?

740
01:08:05,527 --> 01:08:07,085
Er... who do you say?

741
01:08:07,127 --> 01:08:11,086
Gladstone. Liberals.
I've bet Nishikanta 50 rupees.

742
01:08:11,127 --> 01:08:13,800
Good. Liberals, then.
Gladstone.

743
01:08:26,007 --> 01:08:28,680
Charu... have an ice cream?

744
01:08:30,287 --> 01:08:32,403
- Why not? Have one.
- No.

745
01:08:35,687 --> 01:08:37,962
Manda, ice cream?

746
01:08:38,007 --> 01:08:39,679
Ice cream?

747
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:43,717
- There's one extra.
- No.

748
01:08:43,767 --> 01:08:44,802
Why?

749
01:08:45,807 --> 01:08:47,604
Gives me a toothache.

750
01:09:05,847 --> 01:09:09,476
Hey cat... some ice cream?

751
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:26,762
Look.

752
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:35,000
Charu, if I write something good,
should it stay in your notebook?

753
01:09:35,047 --> 01:09:40,440
Nobody else sees it. It never gets printed.
That's wrong, isn't it?

754
01:09:40,487 --> 01:09:42,284
Of course.

755
01:09:42,327 --> 01:09:46,320
Then you must admit,
I write very well, don't I?

756
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,561
Of course.

757
01:09:47,607 --> 01:09:50,167
This is something that deserves respect,
don't you think?

758
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,799
Of course.

759
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:55,681
Then, I can hope for a little more
respect in future, right?

760
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,919
Are you going out?

761
01:10:07,967 --> 01:10:10,640
I'll just go and show this to my friends.

762
01:10:12,567 --> 01:10:19,564
BISHWABANDHU

763
01:11:07,047 --> 01:11:09,117
The Cry Of The Cuckoo

764
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,597
The Lament Of The Cuckoo

765
01:14:10,007 --> 01:14:12,077
My Village

766
01:14:24,247 --> 01:14:27,444
Hey!
What on earth...?

767
01:14:31,207 --> 01:14:32,401
Look.

768
01:14:33,447 --> 01:14:35,483
Look, look, look.

769
01:14:36,527 --> 01:14:37,721
Something by you.

770
01:14:42,287 --> 01:14:43,515
In Bishwabandhu!

771
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:10,483
Too much spice in Amal's paan
burns his mouth. I'll do it from now on.

772
01:16:02,607 --> 01:16:04,279
Charu, you...

773
01:16:16,367 --> 01:16:17,402
You...

774
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:22,681
What are you doing?

775
01:16:28,207 --> 01:16:30,562
What's come over you?

776
01:16:32,807 --> 01:16:35,401
Don't you realise how well
you've written?

777
01:16:37,607 --> 01:16:40,804
When I told you to write
about your village

778
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:44,157
I had no idea that
you'd write so well.

779
01:16:45,807 --> 01:16:49,959
Really! You've made me
feel very small.

780
01:16:51,927 --> 01:16:56,079
So simple, so flowing!

781
01:16:57,167 --> 01:17:03,322
You can't stop this, Charu.
You must keep writing.

782
01:17:03,367 --> 01:17:05,437
Otherwise,
this wonderful talent...

783
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:12,165
I won't write anymore.
Never again.

784
01:17:15,447 --> 01:17:17,119
I can't write.

785
01:17:22,287 --> 01:17:26,519
Why are you crying?
Don't cry.

786
01:17:37,807 --> 01:17:39,001
Of course.

787
01:17:43,327 --> 01:17:45,124
How silly of me.

788
01:17:53,567 --> 01:17:55,558
Now, your shirt's all wet.

789
01:18:36,047 --> 01:18:37,639
To the Liberals!

790
01:18:37,687 --> 01:18:40,281
Liberals.
Liberals!

791
01:18:43,447 --> 01:18:46,484
Bhupati has won his bet.

792
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,802
And with that money,
we're celebrating.

793
01:18:48,847 --> 01:18:50,724
But, whose party is this?

794
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:54,806
Because the money was originally mine -
I lost the bet.

795
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:57,361
So, who is the actual host?

796
01:18:57,407 --> 01:19:00,524
Bhupatinath Dutt
or Nishikanta Choudhary?

797
01:19:00,567 --> 01:19:02,637
Why should you be the host?

798
01:19:02,687 --> 01:19:04,996
The money was originally
your father's.

799
01:19:06,567 --> 01:19:08,159
Order, order!

800
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:12,041
Bhupati, the musicians
are all waiting.

801
01:19:12,087 --> 01:19:14,476
What's the point in
wasting time talking?

802
01:19:14,527 --> 01:19:16,324
Perfectly right, no point.

803
01:19:16,367 --> 01:19:21,395
Certainly, we'll have our music.

804
01:19:23,247 --> 01:19:25,397
But first, I want to say something.

805
01:19:26,607 --> 01:19:30,919
We're celebrating because
the Liberals have won today.

806
01:19:30,967 --> 01:19:36,883
And, in our present political
scenario, we should.

807
01:19:36,927 --> 01:19:43,036
In my opinion, today, we should
honour one very special person.

808
01:19:43,087 --> 01:19:49,003
This celebration, the Sentinel paper,
our political consciousness,

809
01:19:49,047 --> 01:19:52,960
is all because of
Raja Rammohan Roy.

810
01:19:53,007 --> 01:19:54,440
Absolutely right.

811
01:19:54,487 --> 01:19:58,958
If it wasn't for him,
it wouldn't matter

812
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:04,035
whether the Parliamentary elections
were won by the Tories or the Liberals.

813
01:20:04,087 --> 01:20:07,921
That's why I think, today,

814
01:20:07,967 --> 01:20:15,203
it is our duty to respect him.

815
01:20:16,367 --> 01:20:19,677
Now, Jaidev will sing a song
that he has himself written.

816
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:22,764
I second Bhupati's proposal.

817
01:20:22,807 --> 01:20:25,321
- Hear, hear.
- But, I want to say something.

818
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:29,883
I want to say that,
after this first song,

819
01:20:29,927 --> 01:20:32,919
we can all get more liberal

820
01:20:32,967 --> 01:20:35,686
and listen to Nitu Babu's song.

821
01:20:35,727 --> 01:20:37,206
Hear, hear!

822
01:20:37,247 --> 01:20:41,001
We should get Shashank
to sing the song.

823
01:20:41,047 --> 01:20:43,163
You're making fun of me.

824
01:20:43,207 --> 01:20:45,357
Go ahead, Jaidev. Carry on.

825
01:20:59,047 --> 01:21:04,167
Remember!

826
01:21:04,767 --> 01:21:14,802
Remember that last day,
which was horrifying

827
01:21:14,847 --> 01:21:18,317
Remember!

828
01:21:18,367 --> 01:21:24,840
Remember that last day,
which was horrifying

829
01:21:24,887 --> 01:21:45,275
Others may talk
but you will be speechless...

830
01:21:45,327 --> 01:21:47,966
So horrible!

831
01:21:48,007 --> 01:21:50,202
Remember!

832
01:21:50,247 --> 01:22:09,964
All worldly attachments with family...

833
01:22:10,007 --> 01:22:14,956
Thinking of them

834
01:22:57,247 --> 01:23:01,604
To keep them safe

835
01:23:01,647 --> 01:23:06,004
You sacrificed ego and pride

836
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:10,438
To keep them safe

837
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:15,003
You sacrificed your ego and pride

838
01:23:15,047 --> 01:23:19,404
Give up all these attachments

839
01:23:19,447 --> 01:23:23,759
And depend on truth alone

840
01:23:23,807 --> 01:23:28,039
Give up all these attachments

841
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:32,399
And depend on truth alone

842
01:23:32,447 --> 01:23:36,725
And depend on truth alone...

843
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:43,759
What are you thinking?

844
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:47,166
Hey Amal!

845
01:23:53,047 --> 01:23:55,242
Thinking about going abroad?

846
01:23:56,967 --> 01:24:02,803
Why should a great man
of our country die abroad?

847
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:05,678
All alone, over there.

848
01:24:07,247 --> 01:24:09,317
How many Bengalis are there
to see his burial?

849
01:24:11,407 --> 01:24:12,601
So you'll go?

850
01:24:23,327 --> 01:24:25,887
Not now, I can't.

851
01:24:27,527 --> 01:24:29,404
Yes, you can.

852
01:24:29,447 --> 01:24:34,680
First Burdwan and then England.
Right, isn't it?

853
01:24:36,607 --> 01:24:38,086
Right, isn't it?

854
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:40,601
Not quite.

855
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:46,885
First Burdwan. Then, marriage.
And after that, England.

856
01:24:47,767 --> 01:24:51,123
- And after that?
- Then Bristol.

857
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,484
And then... a barrister!

858
01:24:57,167 --> 01:24:58,964
And after that?

859
01:24:59,007 --> 01:25:03,159
And then... back to Bengal.

860
01:25:03,207 --> 01:25:06,563
Black native! Tail between my legs!

861
01:25:07,487 --> 01:25:09,284
What do you say?

862
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,639
Bengal? Nothing else?

863
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:17,444
And Bankim!

864
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:20,477
Babu Bankim Chandra.

865
01:25:24,567 --> 01:25:26,762
Byron to Bankim.

866
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:34,358
Vishabriksha.

867
01:25:35,327 --> 01:25:36,521
And me?

868
01:25:42,487 --> 01:25:48,483
I'm bad?
No good? Huh?

869
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:01,919
Here you are.

870
01:26:15,767 --> 01:26:19,316
Why aren't you singing at the party?

871
01:26:19,367 --> 01:26:21,437
You've got such a good voice.

872
01:26:28,527 --> 01:26:30,245
Charu?

873
01:26:33,447 --> 01:26:36,007
- We're leaving tomorrow.
- Where to?

874
01:26:36,047 --> 01:26:39,357
Manda's father is sick.
We got a wire today.

875
01:26:39,407 --> 01:26:40,442
Oh!

876
01:26:44,527 --> 01:26:46,518
The money I owed you.

877
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:50,517
Does dada know that
you're leaving?

878
01:26:50,567 --> 01:26:52,762
Yes. I have told him.

879
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:56,516
Moreover, I'll be returning in a few days.

880
01:26:56,567 --> 01:26:58,637
Do help him a little while we're away.

881
01:27:01,607 --> 01:27:05,441
It's tomorrow's early morning train.
We must start packing.

882
01:27:06,927 --> 01:27:07,962
We'll go.

883
01:27:09,927 --> 01:27:10,962
Manda.

884
01:27:13,927 --> 01:27:16,316
Lend me a copy of
the magazine with your article.

885
01:27:18,287 --> 01:27:19,322
Manda.

886
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:22,882
If nothing else,
I can read your name.

887
01:27:34,847 --> 01:27:38,396
Dada will find it difficult by himself.

888
01:27:40,487 --> 01:27:44,241
Why? You're here.

889
01:27:44,287 --> 01:27:47,484
You don't expect me to be
the manager of the Sentinel, do you?

890
01:27:47,527 --> 01:27:49,677
Yes I do.

891
01:27:49,727 --> 01:27:51,718
Sit. You're captive.

892
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:54,361
You stay as long as
the paper stays.

893
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,200
Fantastic!

894
01:27:57,247 --> 01:28:01,559
Before the party breaks up,
I have a proposal...

895
01:28:01,607 --> 01:28:03,882
sorry, a complaint to make,

896
01:28:03,927 --> 01:28:11,515
and that complaint is directed
at our editor of the Sentinel paper.

897
01:28:11,567 --> 01:28:14,400
I mean, our host tonight.

898
01:28:14,447 --> 01:28:16,517
It's against Bhupatinath Dutta.

899
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:24,524
Bhupati is acting as he doesn't
know what I'm talking about.

900
01:28:25,687 --> 01:28:28,804
May I first enquire...

901
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:36,198
whether you are aware
of this magazine?

902
01:28:37,527 --> 01:28:40,166
Or whether perhaps,
you even read it?

903
01:28:40,207 --> 01:28:42,004
No, no.

904
01:28:43,127 --> 01:28:48,485
Are you saying
that you haven't read

905
01:28:48,527 --> 01:28:53,317
the contribution on page 22?

906
01:28:53,367 --> 01:28:54,402
No.

907
01:28:56,447 --> 01:28:58,517
Would you take an oath on that?

908
01:28:58,567 --> 01:28:59,602
Yes.

909
01:29:00,247 --> 01:29:02,841
What's all this mystery?
Tell us.

910
01:29:02,887 --> 01:29:04,286
You sly devil!

911
01:29:04,327 --> 01:29:07,319
Your wife is writing
for a magazine like Bishwabandhu

912
01:29:07,367 --> 01:29:09,358
and you keep it a secret?

913
01:29:09,407 --> 01:29:10,840
Hey, hey!

914
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:12,843
I haven't read it.

915
01:29:12,887 --> 01:29:17,039
What does this say?
Mrs Charulata Dutta!

916
01:29:17,087 --> 01:29:18,122
Hmm?

917
01:29:18,167 --> 01:29:20,840
- Something by Charu?
- Yes.

918
01:29:21,527 --> 01:29:26,317
Girish Ghosh had better watch out.
He has a rival.

919
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:30,317
It must be something
she wrote long ago.

920
01:29:30,367 --> 01:29:32,881
Long ago? Prehistoric?

921
01:29:39,447 --> 01:29:41,039
Hip hip hooray!

922
01:29:56,607 --> 01:29:59,440
Here. Just sign here.

923
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:10,038
Right then. You'll get your
order on Wednesday.

924
01:30:10,087 --> 01:30:11,679
Right, good morning.

925
01:30:14,287 --> 01:30:15,322
Come.

926
01:30:23,807 --> 01:30:25,877
Tell me, what can I do for you?

927
01:30:28,087 --> 01:30:30,203
What's the meaning of this letter?

928
01:30:30,247 --> 01:30:33,762
- Oh, it is our letter.
- I know.

929
01:30:33,807 --> 01:30:37,436
What about the meaning?
Is the English wrong?

930
01:30:37,487 --> 01:30:40,399
- You know very well what I mean.
- Go on.

931
01:30:40,447 --> 01:30:43,280
We owed you 2,700 rupees for paper.

932
01:30:43,327 --> 01:30:44,362
Yes, that's right.

933
01:30:44,407 --> 01:30:50,118
Three months ago, in February,
my manager paid this to you.

934
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:53,398
So what is the meaning
of this solicitor's letter?

935
01:30:53,447 --> 01:30:57,725
Oh. So, your manager says
he paid this money, huh?

936
01:30:57,767 --> 01:30:59,883
- Certainly.
- Oh.

937
01:31:00,567 --> 01:31:02,159
All twenty-seven hundred?

938
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:04,596
- There must be some mistake.
- Hmm.

939
01:31:06,087 --> 01:31:08,681
- Where is your manager?
- He's not here just now.

940
01:31:08,727 --> 01:31:11,195
Oh, so he's cleared out.

941
01:31:11,247 --> 01:31:13,966
Tell me whatever you
wanted to say to him.

942
01:31:14,007 --> 01:31:16,077
What could I have to tell?

943
01:31:16,967 --> 01:31:21,882
As if he didn't know how
much he had paid.

944
01:31:22,767 --> 01:31:25,486
Oh here. Just a minute.

945
01:31:27,687 --> 01:31:30,963
Look here.
300 rupees in all.

946
01:31:31,007 --> 01:31:35,603
Yes - and that too,
after we sent out three reminders.

947
01:31:36,447 --> 01:31:38,039
Here you are.

948
01:31:40,687 --> 01:31:41,722
What?

949
01:31:42,447 --> 01:31:46,326
Look. Here are copies of
all the correspondence.

950
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:50,642
Everything is perfectly clear.

951
01:31:54,327 --> 01:31:58,923
Sir, we only send solicitor letters
as a last resort.

952
01:31:59,527 --> 01:32:03,281
It does us no good to
offend customers.

953
01:32:05,727 --> 01:32:08,844
Where would we be without them?

954
01:32:12,087 --> 01:32:19,596
But, we have to look at the
business side as well, right?

955
01:32:22,887 --> 01:32:25,879
I mean, our relationship...

956
01:32:25,927 --> 01:32:27,485
All right. I'll look into it.

957
01:32:27,486 --> 01:32:29,044
...give money and take goods.

958
01:32:32,487 --> 01:32:34,796
Look at this.
Oh sir!

959
01:32:35,567 --> 01:32:38,127
- You forgot your...
- Oh!

960
01:32:45,527 --> 01:32:48,678
So, by the end of this month?

961
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:54,240
His stick alone would fetch
a hundred if he sold it.

962
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:37,602
Amal?

963
01:33:43,967 --> 01:33:48,483
Dada... this late?

964
01:35:04,847 --> 01:35:06,917
Won't dada come up?

965
01:35:12,687 --> 01:35:14,484
I'll go and see.

966
01:35:19,127 --> 01:35:20,162
Amal.

967
01:35:24,807 --> 01:35:29,722
Promise me, whatever happens,
you won't go away.

968
01:35:29,767 --> 01:35:34,124
- What could happen?
- Promise me.

969
01:35:34,167 --> 01:35:36,158
What are you afraid of?

970
01:35:40,727 --> 01:35:45,005
Promise, please.
Whatever happens, you won't go.

971
01:35:45,047 --> 01:35:47,925
Tell me. Promise me.

972
01:35:48,607 --> 01:35:52,964
Dada's come. Let me go
and see what happened.

973
01:35:53,007 --> 01:35:56,317
Promise me. Please.
Why won't you promise?

974
01:35:56,367 --> 01:35:59,439
You won't go. You won't go.

975
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:03,196
Promise me. Promise me.

976
01:36:03,247 --> 01:36:07,160
Let me go. Leave me.

977
01:36:55,287 --> 01:36:56,356
Dada.

978
01:37:06,207 --> 01:37:10,837
You've seen dead soldiers in the theatre?
There's one there.

979
01:37:14,487 --> 01:37:19,561
But this one will not get up
when the curtains come down.

980
01:37:49,287 --> 01:37:51,562
My favourite smell.

981
01:37:52,207 --> 01:37:54,767
Smell of printing ink.

982
01:37:57,967 --> 01:37:59,195
Let's go.

983
01:38:29,447 --> 01:38:31,642
What a man!

984
01:38:32,527 --> 01:38:34,597
So near to me, a relative.

985
01:38:34,647 --> 01:38:38,845
No, more than that, a friend.

986
01:38:38,887 --> 01:38:41,879
To think a man like that
would betray me, Amal.

987
01:38:44,767 --> 01:38:48,316
Forget about the payments
that he withheld...

988
01:38:48,367 --> 01:38:50,642
he also took loans in my name.

989
01:38:50,687 --> 01:38:54,726
I can't tell you how shamelessly
he has been exploiting my good name.

990
01:38:54,767 --> 01:38:57,645
And I put all my trust in him.

991
01:38:59,847 --> 01:39:04,318
When I came to know,
I got such a shock.

992
01:39:04,367 --> 01:39:06,835
My head started reeling.

993
01:39:07,767 --> 01:39:12,761
I told Abdul to drive anywhere.

994
01:39:12,807 --> 01:39:15,162
I needed some fresh air.

995
01:39:20,647 --> 01:39:23,957
The money doesn't matter so much.

996
01:39:24,007 --> 01:39:26,919
What's owed, I'll pay.

997
01:39:32,927 --> 01:39:35,361
But...

998
01:39:35,407 --> 01:39:40,083
for a man to behave like this!

999
01:39:40,127 --> 01:39:44,279
A man I put such trust in -
to show no appreciation.

1000
01:39:44,327 --> 01:39:50,721
It makes you lose all faith in men.
What is there to live for, Amal?

1001
01:39:50,767 --> 01:39:55,363
Trust, faith, integrity -

1002
01:39:55,407 --> 01:39:58,877
are all these empty words?

1003
01:39:59,607 --> 01:40:04,203
When you can't trust a man
so close to you...

1004
01:40:05,487 --> 01:40:11,005
how can people go on
living together?

1005
01:40:18,647 --> 01:40:20,956
It's been a terrible blow, Amal.

1006
01:40:21,007 --> 01:40:23,999
My whole world seems
to be crumbling.

1007
01:40:24,847 --> 01:40:27,077
What can I do to help, dada?

1008
01:40:29,247 --> 01:40:31,442
You don't have to do anything, Amal.

1009
01:40:34,447 --> 01:40:38,406
Just stay as you are, that's all.

1010
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:47,362
I needed to talk to someone.

1011
01:40:47,407 --> 01:40:50,001
I couldn't tell Charu the truth.

1012
01:40:51,327 --> 01:40:53,841
- Have you had dinner?
- Yes.

1013
01:40:55,967 --> 01:41:00,119
Lets do one thing. How about going away
for a few days by the sea?

1014
01:41:01,647 --> 01:41:04,719
I mean it. Think it over.

1015
01:41:34,127 --> 01:41:36,197
You know what's happened?

1016
01:41:38,887 --> 01:41:40,115
Yes.

1017
01:41:44,167 --> 01:41:49,525
Charu, you wrote such
a nice piece in that magazine.

1018
01:41:49,567 --> 01:41:52,081
You never showed me anything.

1019
01:41:53,647 --> 01:42:00,166
When Nishikanta came out with it
in front of everybody,

1020
01:42:00,207 --> 01:42:03,119
I felt so embarrassed and hurt.

1021
01:42:04,687 --> 01:42:06,996
When could I tell you?

1022
01:42:07,047 --> 01:42:09,163
You're always so busy.

1023
01:42:14,687 --> 01:42:16,757
I won't be busy any more.

1024
01:42:18,087 --> 01:42:22,365
I've got rid of your rival.

1025
01:42:25,647 --> 01:42:30,038
Now I can give you all my time.

1026
01:42:34,607 --> 01:42:38,486
Dear dada, I feel that
after what has happened

1027
01:42:38,527 --> 01:42:42,759
my staying here is only
an extra burden on you.

1028
01:42:42,807 --> 01:42:46,482
I have heard about a job out of town

1029
01:42:46,527 --> 01:42:49,121
and I'm going to see about it.

1030
01:42:49,167 --> 01:42:53,524
I'll write when I arrive.
Best wishes to both of you.

1031
01:42:53,567 --> 01:42:56,001
Yours affectionately,
Amal.

1032
01:43:19,767 --> 01:43:23,316
P.S. Charu must not
give up her writing.

1033
01:44:36,647 --> 01:44:39,241
Did you see this?
Do you know what has happened?

1034
01:44:39,287 --> 01:44:41,357
- What happened?
- He's gone away.

1035
01:44:41,407 --> 01:44:43,762
- Who?
- Your dear friend, Amal.

1036
01:44:44,967 --> 01:44:47,879
Packed all his things at night
and cleared out.

1037
01:44:47,927 --> 01:44:52,125
Look, he left a letter saying
he didn't want to be a burden.

1038
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:54,556
As if Amal could ever be a burden!

1039
01:44:55,527 --> 01:44:57,995
- What are you saying?
- I'm telling the truth.

1040
01:44:59,607 --> 01:45:01,677
Where are you going?
The room is empty.

1041
01:45:06,167 --> 01:45:11,719
He had some of my proof sheets.
I thought I'd come and take them.

1042
01:45:11,767 --> 01:45:15,237
What do I see? He's gone!

1043
01:45:15,287 --> 01:45:18,120
Yes, you're right. He's gone.

1044
01:45:18,167 --> 01:45:19,361
How strange!

1045
01:45:20,207 --> 01:45:21,242
Brojo!

1046
01:45:24,047 --> 01:45:26,481
Brojo! Brojo?

1047
01:45:27,127 --> 01:45:31,996
- Brojo! Are you deaf?
- But I said I was...

1048
01:45:32,047 --> 01:45:35,164
- Go and put away his bedding.
- Whose bedding?

1049
01:45:35,207 --> 01:45:38,916
Amal's bedding. Who else?
You stupid old...

1050
01:45:43,327 --> 01:45:49,163
Charu, I know you're angry
and you have reason to be.

1051
01:45:49,207 --> 01:45:53,837
But, just think...

1052
01:45:53,887 --> 01:45:56,447
Amal's sense of responsibility.

1053
01:45:56,487 --> 01:46:01,117
Think of how he's matured!
To go away for my sake!

1054
01:46:01,167 --> 01:46:05,080
But he's still a child.
Forgot to say where he's going.

1055
01:46:05,127 --> 01:46:06,526
Silly boy!

1056
01:46:07,447 --> 01:46:12,521
Where would he go?
There's only one place possible. Burdwan.

1057
01:46:12,567 --> 01:46:14,797
Just enquire and you'll see I'm right.

1058
01:46:14,847 --> 01:46:16,075
Burdwan?

1059
01:46:17,967 --> 01:46:19,844
What a silly notion, Burdwan.

1060
01:46:44,007 --> 01:46:45,042
Charu...

1061
01:46:48,367 --> 01:46:49,402
Yes.

1062
01:46:53,207 --> 01:46:56,324
No. I can't say these things properly.

1063
01:46:58,367 --> 01:47:01,165
Perhaps it would be easier
if I read Bankim. Right?

1064
01:47:21,087 --> 01:47:22,884
My first grey hair.

1065
01:47:29,287 --> 01:47:32,404
Charu, aren't you going to
write any more?

1066
01:47:34,447 --> 01:47:37,086
Do you know why
I like your writing so much?

1067
01:47:38,087 --> 01:47:39,281
Why?

1068
01:47:39,327 --> 01:47:41,636
Because I can understand it all.

1069
01:47:41,687 --> 01:47:43,837
The others I can't.

1070
01:47:44,527 --> 01:47:45,960
Write, Charu.

1071
01:47:48,007 --> 01:47:49,884
I will.

1072
01:47:49,927 --> 01:47:52,566
You start a new paper,
then I'll write.

1073
01:47:52,607 --> 01:47:55,724
You'll write in my paper?
Politics?

1074
01:47:58,087 --> 01:48:00,999
- Why? Why only politics?
- Then?

1075
01:48:01,847 --> 01:48:05,840
Must a paper be full of politics?
Why not have both?

1076
01:48:05,887 --> 01:48:08,959
Politics in English
and other things in Bengali.

1077
01:48:11,247 --> 01:48:14,398
You look after one,
I'll look after the other.

1078
01:48:19,887 --> 01:48:22,481
- What? What?
- Is it not possible?

1079
01:48:22,527 --> 01:48:25,678
But that's a wonderful
suggestion. Brilliant.

1080
01:48:25,727 --> 01:48:28,844
- Do you think we can do it?
- We can.

1081
01:48:39,167 --> 01:48:40,759
We're not alone.

1082
01:48:41,447 --> 01:48:43,244
Nishikanta can help.

1083
01:48:43,287 --> 01:48:45,755
- Two people can do it.
- Three people.

1084
01:48:47,407 --> 01:48:50,877
Yes. Three of us. Hooray!

1085
01:48:52,847 --> 01:48:55,566
Listen, we won't
stay here anymore.

1086
01:48:55,607 --> 01:48:57,723
They talk about the roar of waves

1087
01:48:57,767 --> 01:49:01,555
but there's nothing like the sound of
a printing press. Lets go. Come.

1088
01:49:01,607 --> 01:49:03,677
- Where?
- Come on, come on.

1089
01:49:05,527 --> 01:49:06,562
Come.

1090
01:49:22,287 --> 01:49:23,686
I made one mistake.

1091
01:49:23,727 --> 01:49:26,878
I should have written and asked
Nishikanta to come to the station.

1092
01:49:26,927 --> 01:49:29,236
Then we could have discussed
our new plan.

1093
01:49:30,487 --> 01:49:33,206
Put these down here, Brojo.

1094
01:49:34,007 --> 01:49:35,884
Where's my bag of shells?

1095
01:49:37,927 --> 01:49:41,966
Listen... would you like some tea?
Or something cold?

1096
01:49:42,007 --> 01:49:44,885
- Now?
- Don't you want anything?

1097
01:49:44,927 --> 01:49:47,964
I thought I'd go and talk to
Nishikanta straight away.

1098
01:49:48,007 --> 01:49:51,522
- Right now?
- I won't be long.

1099
01:49:51,567 --> 01:49:55,765
Now is best. Before he gets started
on something else.

1100
01:49:55,807 --> 01:49:57,286
Moti ma!

1101
01:49:57,327 --> 01:49:59,921
Tell Brojo to send up
the Englishman.

1102
01:50:02,647 --> 01:50:05,161
I haven't seen a paper
for so many days.

1103
01:50:05,207 --> 01:50:07,437
God knows what is happening.

1104
01:50:08,847 --> 01:50:10,644
It's so hot today.

1105
01:50:11,487 --> 01:50:14,763
- Oh, Moti ma.
- Coming.

1106
01:50:14,807 --> 01:50:18,163
Bring some water. I'll take a bath.

1107
01:50:33,527 --> 01:50:34,721
Charu.

1108
01:50:40,487 --> 01:50:42,079
Did you call?

1109
01:50:43,847 --> 01:50:46,964
Amal is in Madras.
With a friend of his.

1110
01:50:48,647 --> 01:50:50,956
Read it and see. It's good news.

1111
01:50:53,087 --> 01:50:54,486
Take it.

1112
01:50:58,487 --> 01:51:00,079
I'll be back.

1113
01:52:12,367 --> 01:52:15,757
Why did you go away?

1114
01:52:27,087 --> 01:52:29,806
Why did you go away?

1115
01:52:35,927 --> 01:52:38,680
Why did you not tell me?

1116
01:52:39,767 --> 01:52:41,246
Amal!

1117
01:53:18,727 --> 01:53:21,844
I've brought the bucket
of water, madam.

1118
01:53:21,887 --> 01:53:23,684
All right.

1119
01:54:32,567 --> 01:54:34,637
Greetings to my respected brother.

1120
01:54:34,687 --> 01:54:38,202
I'm in Madras, at a friend's house.

1121
01:54:38,647 --> 01:54:40,239
I'm fine

1122
01:54:40,287 --> 01:54:44,041
but these few days, I've been hearing
the notes of the tanpura.

1123
01:54:44,647 --> 01:54:46,922
You can write to them in Burdwan.

1124
01:54:47,607 --> 01:54:51,885
Is your attempt to revive
the dead soldier still going on?

1125
01:54:51,927 --> 01:54:54,282
My salutations to both of you.

1126
01:54:54,327 --> 01:54:56,397
Yours, Amal.

1127
01:56:53,967 --> 01:56:56,037
- Brojo?
- Yes?

1128
01:56:56,727 --> 01:56:58,718
Bring the lamps in.

1129
01:58:26,047 --> 01:58:27,082
Come in.

1130
01:58:37,567 --> 01:58:38,966
Come in.

1131
01:59:24,607 --> 01:59:32,639
A BROKEN HOME
