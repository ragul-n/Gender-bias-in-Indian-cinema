00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:52,663
-There are minor correction.
-This is a new style.

202
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:54,715
If you correct it,
the project can be approved.

Not 'as usual.'

00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,719
It is 'age use well.'

-Lower your voice, dude.
-Why should I?

210
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:11,423
Will he make us sit for two years more?

211
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:12,727
He'll anyway do that.

00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:41,353
Wait and watch, he'll
get the PhD before us.

I should at least make
you tea for doing all this.

239
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,214
I'll have tea only
after Harika comes home.

240
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,168
Shouldn't you at least
drink tea in Harika's absence?

is my first time to come here to stay.

Did you serve me anytime?

253
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:12,748
The only reason I didn't serve
is that you don't drink tea.

254

You should do some things
without any reason as well.

-Hari
-Don't get scared.

346
00:20:56,658 --> 00:20:57,671
Sleep in my room.

347
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:00,233
Please stay with me. Please, Harika.

348
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:02,531
Nothing would happen.
Just sleep in that room.

349
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:07,564
[groaning sound from TV]

350
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:22,053
I'll give 500 bucks for
those who get me head gasket.

351
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:23,259
-500 bucks!
-Yeah!

352
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:24,744
We can party all night!

353
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:27,782
Bro, I found it.

354
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,679
Wow! You are very smart, Raju!

355
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:33,274
Here are your 500 rupees.

356
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:36,037
I don't want 500 rupees.
100 rupees are enough.

357
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:37,580
Why so?

358
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:40,342
-I'm honest in every work.
-Alright.

359
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,788
What is the next item that we
should get? Come on, tell us.

360
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,985
Next item: Timing cover.

361
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:49,012
Come on, bro. Why do you still want to
know the time when you have a wall clock?

362
00:21:49,112 --> 00:21:50,311
Hey, I'm not bothered about wall clock.

363
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:51,889
Get the timing cover
that is inside the engine

364
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:55,309
These idiots won't get any items.
I have got all the items with me.

365
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,927
Bro, I found it. Take it.

366
00:21:57,069 --> 00:21:58,525
-Wow!
-Here, take it.

367
00:21:58,655 --> 00:21:59,259
Love you, dude!

368
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:02,064
Here, 200 rupees.

369
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:04,875
What's this bro?
Just 200 rupees for this toil?

370
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:06,595
It is very difficult to outrun them.

371
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:09,260
I'll anyway pay you. But tell me, why is
it just you who is finding all the parts?

372
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,326
Are the other guys idiots?

373
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,225
They are indeed idiots, bro!

374
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:14,594
They are searching for old
items. I'm not like them.

375
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:16,580
I'm getting all those
directly from the car.

376
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,767
If the doctor comes to know about this,
he will put us in the trunk and bash.

377
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:23,991
We'll him that those parts got
damaged. He'll install new parts.

378
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:24,805
-Why should we even care about it?
-[laughs]

379
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:27,638
It's alright. Get the 90.

380
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:28,796
90 ml? Do you mean a
quarter bottle of booze?

381
00:22:29,386 --> 00:22:31,635
My owner got intoxicated with that
and didn't come to the garage yet.

382
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:32,437
You!

383
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,729
How can you even think
90 ml is a quarter bottle?

384
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:34,842
-Then?
-I meant 90 sized spanner.

385
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,352
That's how you should tell me.

386
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:37,623
I thought 90 ml means a
quarter bottle of booze.

387
00:22:39,907 --> 00:22:43,452
-Bro, take it.
-Superb, Raju!

388
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:47,388
Thank you. Today, I'll have a
party night with 90 ml of booze.

389
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,726
Don't tell anything to the doctor.

390
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:50,708
I'll not tell him. You to do the same.

391
00:22:51,018 --> 00:22:52,870
I'd lose my rep if he comes to
know that I took money from you.

392
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:58,169
-No, thank you.
-Take it.

393
00:22:58,655 --> 00:22:59,957
Just take it.

394
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:02,137
Cheers!

395
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:08,805
Just have a sip.
And you'll start craving after each sip.

396
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:13,787
What happened?

397
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:16,097
If you are bothered about the smell,

398
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:18,659
you'll not get the courage
and the ghost stays here.

399
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:23,386
Take it inside and
get rid of the ghost.

400
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,049
Hey, just have it.

401
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,020
How is it?

402
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:35,113
Umm...

403
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:37,151
Very good!

404
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,283
See,

405
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:51,922
after opening the Vodka bottle,
neither did the ghost come

406
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:53,699
nor there's been any sound.

407
00:23:56,142 --> 00:24:00,736
Even if it comes, I'll hold it by its
plait and bang its head to the floor.

408
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:01,803
Hahaha...

409
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:06,401
[phone rings]

410
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,912
My ghost is calling. I'll leave.

411
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:12,908
Hey... Sit here.

412
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:15,309
I'm not the one who should stay here.

413
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:18,784
This should.

414
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:23,416
If this is with you,
you need not want anyone's company.

415
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:24,476
See you again.

416
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:27,766
See you again. [door shuts]

417
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:28,622
[laughs]

418
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:34,388
Cheers...

419
00:24:34,588 --> 00:24:35,375
Mwah!

420
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:38,162
[creaking sound]
[gasps]

421
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:43,572
Oye! Shh!

422
00:24:45,729 --> 00:24:47,031
[creaking sound]

423
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:51,268
Oh man! Don't do that!

424
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:58,140
I'll take you to task now!

425
00:24:58,981 --> 00:24:59,818
[chair creaks]

426
00:25:01,963 --> 00:25:04,468
I told you not to do that. Didn't I?

427
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:07,383
[laughs]

428
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:13,715
[clock ticking rapidly]

429
00:25:17,858 --> 00:25:21,164
Oh, you are here!
[shatters]

430
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:21,787
Ow!

431
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:22,503
[gasps]

432
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:28,603
[groans in pain]

433
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,744
Who is it? Who is it?

434
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,625
You broke my leg! My leg!

435
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:34,299
Put an ice pack on it immediately.

436
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,419
Are you mad? Would anyone hit that hard?

437
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,358
Oh!
Are you the one who is scaring me?

438
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:41,258
Yes.

439
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:42,746
How?

440
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:47,093
-[clangs] Ow!
-How are you doing that?

441
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,297
Don't hit it hard!

442
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:52,470
I've got magnetic tools.

443
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,408
Do you know that it's been
two days that I have slept?

444
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:01,281
-Hello
-Yes.

445
00:26:01,536 --> 00:26:02,443
Are you listening?

446
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:06,286
There is no ice.

447
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:09,264
Is the pain gone?

448
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,378
Why did you scare me? Tell me.

449
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:17,225
I could hear the sounds that
are coming from your room.

450
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:19,519
Likewise!

451
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:20,801
Likewise!

452
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:22,644
That's the reason.

453
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:25,563
Why are we hearing the sounds?

454
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:27,091
My ill-fate!

455
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,629
These Parmeshwari-Maheshwari
apartments used to be in conjunction.

456
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,344
Brothers fell apart after their
father's demise and made this partition.

457
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:36,298
Oh!

458
00:26:36,357 --> 00:26:37,810
The wall that is between
them came between us.

459
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,862
Bloody misers! Ow!

460
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:41,469
What do you want now?

461
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:42,323
I want you to vacate.

462
00:26:42,722 --> 00:26:44,922
So you are allergic to sounds.

463
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:47,435
So, you're making the occupants
of this room vacate forcibly.

464
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:49,346
Well grasped!

465
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:50,500
Vacate quickly!

466
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:51,882
I won't!

467
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:55,012
I won't vacate at all
for what you have done.

468
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:56,474
You are going to face the troubles.

469
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:57,664
Are you blackmailing me?

470
00:26:57,946 --> 00:26:59,885
Do whatever you can.

471
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:04,212
You'll end up vacating that apartment.

472
00:27:05,265 --> 00:27:07,585
You too.

473
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,177
-Alright, let's see.
-Okay.

474

"The neem leaves eaten regularly
over a period lose its bitter taste"

475

Vemana at that time"

476
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:25,650
"But when we he watches these theatrics"

477
00:27:25,748 --> 00:27:28,994

480

00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,397
"Why are you waging this?"

484
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:58,193
"Why are you involved in this endless
uncordial and unwitty contention,"

485
00:27:58,393 --> 00:27:59,403
"Oh girl?"

486
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,189
"Why are you doing this?"

00:28:08,005 --> 00:28:09,126

Err...

507
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:19,588
Look...

508
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:23,727
I won't disturb you anymore.

509
00:29:25,728 --> 00:29:26,459
I didn't hear you!

510
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:35,713
If you mess with me,
I'd do the same to you.

511
00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:39,754
Hey... No... No... We don't want to
continue this. Let's stop this here.

512
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:42,507
-Let's stop this here.
-So soon?

513
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,316
You and I, let's come to an understanding.

514
00:29:45,924 --> 00:29:49,261
Well, you can do whatever you
want until I return from college.

515
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:50,424
After that, let's share two hours each.

516
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:51,782
And you shall do anything
in your time and vice-versa.

517
00:29:52,171 --> 00:29:53,167
Let's not meddle in each other's time.

518
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:54,404
Let's prepare a time table.

519
00:29:55,198 --> 00:29:55,769
The deal is on!

520
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,091
The deal is on!

521
00:30:09,168 --> 00:30:12,151
Bro, why is he struggling like a surgeon?

522
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:14,050
He is making a soundless engine.

523
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,383
Shh! Does he know that this
motorcycle belongs to Obul Reddy?

524
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:22,906
I too doubt whether it
would be successful or not.

525
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:26,319
This motorcycle belongs to Obul Reddy
and I gave it to him by putting faith.

526
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:28,140
-Let's see what would happen.
-I have my doubts.

527
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:33,264
[chuckles]

528
00:30:34,236 --> 00:30:35,068
What's with him, man!

529
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:44,897
Doctor

530
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:45,799
Me?

531
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,118
Start the motorcycle.

532
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:52,612
This motorcycle belongs to Obul Reddy.

533
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:02,382
[ignition starts]

534
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:08,376
[low whirring sound]

535
00:31:08,794 --> 00:31:13,414
Oh no! Call the fire engine!
This is going to get blazed.

536
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:18,531
What have you done?

537
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:23,557
Is this your hardwork of all these days on
the pretence of a soundless engine, jerk?

538
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,199
Fix each part in their
original position and leave.

539
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:32,207
If you ever give him any of
your tools, I'll spank all of you!

540
00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:35,212
Bro.

541
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:38,843
Bro, a selfie please.

542
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:41,105
Feeling sad.

543
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,819

00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:15,371

00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:25,261
"Why are you waging this?"

555
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:28,838
"Why are you involved in this endless
uncordial and unwitty contention,"

556
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:32,115
-"Oh girl?"
-Damn!

557
00:32:32,323 --> 00:32:34,929
"Why are you doing this?"

558
00:32:35,129 --> 00:32:38,468
"The neem leaves eaten regularly
over a period lose its bitter taste"

00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:20,379
Uff! Did you wait for me for a minute?

571
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:23,786
My formula is in halfway.

572
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:25,381
I too have an exam.

575
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:01,319
Just shut it!

00:34:02,614 --> 00:34:05,540
Tsk! The time isn't up.
15 minutes are remaining.

577
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,432
Is that a violin or violence?

578
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,619
What? What happened?

579
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,087
It doesn't seem like you are
playing. It's like slitting my neck.

580
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:14,551
Uff! Oh no!

581
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:17,163
You are learning violin!
You got an admission in the college.

582
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,435
The guy who gave you the
admission should be kicked!

583
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:21,781
It is getting difficult
to play as per timings.

584
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:22,604
It is not happening.

585
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,396
Look, I'll give away my timings to you.

586
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:26,461
Play as much as you can.

587
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:27,987
Phew!

588
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:37,665
[playing violin]

589
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:43,249
Ow!

590
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:49,872
Hey... Didn't you tell me just
now to take as much time as I can?

591
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:51,483
Is anyone holding you at gunpoint?

592
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,770
What's wrong with your playing?

593
00:34:53,984 --> 00:34:54,735
That's not the case.

594
00:34:56,266 --> 00:35:00,990
If someone is before me or
hears me, I feel conscious.

595
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:04,298
The music itself is freedom.

596
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:07,774
Everyone has to feel free. How would
you play if you can't feel it in yourself?

597
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:08,972
That's bothering me.

598
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:18,769
Remove your watch.

599
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,890
Free your hair.

600
00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:40,894
Feel relaxed. I mean feel free.

601
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:41,797
How do you know?

602
00:35:42,847 --> 00:35:45,563
Something is missing in your music.

603
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:49,192
As if it is tightened or froze.

604
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:53,088
First, close your eyes.

605
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:56,867
Feel free.

606
00:35:59,805 --> 00:36:00,976
It's just you in there.

607
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,992
You know nothing about
the world except the violin.

608
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:11,838
The entire world contains
only... you and your violin.

609

[playing violin]

610
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:11,721
For the first time, I have liked a sound.

611
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:14,716
Thank you.

612
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:17,888
I don't know that I'd play so wonderfully.

613
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:20,613
You are very talented.

614
00:37:21,835 --> 00:37:23,249
This is the raaga of my mother.

615
00:37:23,348 --> 00:37:24,983
She used to play this tune from a veena.

616
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:30,150
Well, what do you do?

617
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:33,326
I'm pursuing a PhD in
Mechanical engineering.

618
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:33,856
[chuckles]

619
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,139
What happened?

620
00:37:35,516 --> 00:37:36,145
I'm sorry.

621
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:39,828
I felt it funny when I heard a
mechanical engineer is allergic to sound.

622
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:40,517
Oh!

623
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:43,258
That's a big story.

624
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,004
Why don't you narrate it?

625
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:50,704
[screw driver whirring]

626
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:52,705
Here, he is my father.

627
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:54,330
His name is Dastagiri.

628
00:37:55,263 --> 00:37:56,353
See his looks.

629
00:37:56,517 --> 00:37:58,380
He seems as if he is born
to follow his passionate work.

630
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:00,802
And even his work seemed
to be originated for him

631
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:03,651
Do you know what that work is?

632
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:07,269
It's difficult to say whether he
chose this job or his job chose him.

633
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,809
He gets irritated even when
someone walks at some place.

634
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:15,103
He won't even breathe loudly.

635
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:16,612
And prevent others from doing it.

636
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:18,396
[pen clinks] Ow! Oh no!

637
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:20,827
He can't even tolerate
the sound of the ant.

638
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:22,659
She is my mother.

639
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:23,960
Her name is Shantamma.

640
00:38:24,591 --> 00:38:25,712
She is an epitome of peace.

641
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,188
In order to maintain peace in the house,

642
00:38:28,745 --> 00:38:30,411
she'd undergo fag as
per what her husband likes

643
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:35,599
She strives to instal a
silence to the pressure cooker.

644
00:38:37,672 --> 00:38:39,719
This is about my family.

645
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:42,874
In our house,
we respect the likes of my father.

646
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,269
It reminds me...

647
00:38:46,177 --> 00:38:47,652
My father likes two things.

648
00:38:47,845 --> 00:38:50,592
1.) RD Burman music.
2.) This rickety scooter.

649
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,821
Why he likes RD Burman songs is that,

650
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,075
he sleeping listening to those songs.

651
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,519
And when it comes to scooter,

652
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,903
this scooter fulfilled his dream
of becoming mechanical engineer

653
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:05,426
by breaking down regularly.

654
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:10,109
If there is anything that could
make sounds in front of my father,

655
00:39:10,654 --> 00:39:12,124
and that would be the scooter.

656
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:24,265
Would you listen to RD Burman's music?s

657
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:29,939
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

658
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:31,725
That's okay.

659
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,618
Let me know when you work.

660
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:38,294
Why? To disturb me?

661
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:40,810
Uhuh! I won't do that.

662
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:43,147
Thank you.

663
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:45,400
Let me know about your
work timings as well.

664
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:47,608
What about your ghost?

665
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:51,550
That became a human now.

666
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:03,744
[door opens]

667
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:09,003
Hi.

668
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:10,710
Seems like you are late.

669
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:17,165
What happened?

670
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,877
I'm upset about myself.

671
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:22,330
Why?

672
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:24,523
Didn't you play it properly in the class?

673
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:28,255
When you have instructed me
last time, it has worked out.

674
00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:31,520
It would work out all the time.

675
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:32,918
All you need to do is perform.

676
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,849
Anyway, you have to know it on your own.

677
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:37,941
I won't be with you all the time.

678
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:43,025
Around?

679
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:47,641
Violin!

680
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,314
What should I call you?

681
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:54,864
Just now you have called
me with a name, right?

682
00:40:57,362 --> 00:40:58,035
Violin?

683
00:40:58,242 --> 00:40:59,105
That's really good.

684
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:04,584
Then, do you know my name?

685
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:05,691
Silencer.

686
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:20,055
[song playing in shopping mall stereo]

687
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,335
That's a mannequin, sir.

688
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:25,470
-Hmm?
-Hmm...

689
00:41:41,153 --> 00:41:43,488
-Can I get a ssofter model of that?
-Why, sir?

Earrings: 6000 rupees.

-The total is 20,000 rupees only, sir.
-Ah!

697
00:42:09,252 --> 00:42:10,558
This is amount from this
month's CM relief fund.

698
00:42:10,682 --> 00:42:11,798
-Raghu...
-Yes.

699
00:42:11,887 --> 00:42:13,803
-Raghu...
-Coming, dear.

700
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:17,648
Can you come inside once?

701
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:25,887
The zipper isn't closing. Try to zip it.

702
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:26,933
Zip?

703
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:33,443
The medium size
clothing became tight on you.

704
00:42:33,605 --> 00:42:35,693
I look fat when I wear loose clothing.

705
00:42:36,275 --> 00:42:37,115
The medium-sized would be better for me.

706
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,562
Anyway, am I fat?

707
00:42:39,652 --> 00:42:41,011
No... No... No...

708
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,321
Are you fat?
Not at all!

709
00:42:43,793 --> 00:42:46,502
I was just telling you about the fitting.

710
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,317
Hey, wait!

711
00:42:48,786 --> 00:42:51,935
-Please... Just wait... Almost done...
-Hey, what are you doing?

712
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:54,285
-Hey...
-Yeah!

713
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:55,839
Mission accomplished!

714
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:57,019
[door opens]

715
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:09,044
-Oh! Sorry, sir.
-Hey...

716
00:43:09,813 --> 00:43:10,871
What were you doing inside?

717
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:11,748
What?

718
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,391
Everyone knows what you
did inside. Just come with me.

719
00:43:13,446 --> 00:43:14,762
Let them know. They'd do if they have to.

720
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:17,586
Know it? I'll take you to task
in the police station. Come.

721
00:43:17,702 --> 00:43:18,437
Sir... Hello...

722
00:43:18,502 --> 00:43:19,404
-We'll take care of that in the station.
-Oye!

723
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:21,855
It's okay if you leave, but pay the bill.

724
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:24,076
Oh my freaking girl!

725
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:28,643
-Sir, let's go!
-Raghu...

726
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:32,006
Go away!

727
00:43:32,428 --> 00:43:34,345
Sir, did you really release him?

728
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:35,897
Otherwise,
keep him with you for one more day.

729
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:36,491
Go away!

730
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,063
-Sir, the shackles!
-Hey...

731
00:43:39,388 --> 00:43:41,215
We wouldn't undergo through
this mess if they have the key?

732
00:43:41,598 --> 00:43:43,326
They can just lock the
shackles but can't open it.

733
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:45,595
Key...

734
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:47,707
Shall we go to the doctor's garage?

735
00:43:48,465 --> 00:43:52,924
Singing: "There is a plateful
of food. Eat it heartfully"

736
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:57,188
"If you are hasty,
the food would fall on the floor"

737
00:43:57,472 --> 00:44:01,700
"If you know about the farmer's toil,"

738
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,437
"you'd know the value of food, Oh dear"

739
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,738
"Wow! This food smells delicious!

740
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:14,894
Are you boxing with the lunch box?

741
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:17,538
No, bro.

742
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:20,507
I think this is not my lunch
box. I couldn't open it.

743
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,383
Where have you filched it from?

744
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:23,982
Bro, that's not the case.

745
00:44:24,523 --> 00:44:26,933
This morning, my neighbour
came here for his vehicle repair.

746
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:28,754
I think the boxes got
swapped at that time.

747
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:32,340
It got opened. Curd-rice! Damn!

748
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,662
[laughs]

749
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,215
Seems like he is an idiot!

750
00:44:36,171 --> 00:44:37,889
He seems to be living on curd-rice.

751
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,332
Hey, elders didn't say this saying.

752
00:44:41,463 --> 00:44:44,560
'Whoever is destined to have the
grain, only they can eat it.'

753
00:44:44,867 --> 00:44:45,948
I've thought about when I
have filched the lunch box.

754
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,534
Every morning I smell non-vegetarian
food from my neighbour's house.

755
00:44:50,974 --> 00:44:52,677
I wonder who she is serving that food.

756
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:56,178
I guess she's restraining her husband
from eating non-vegetarian food.

757
00:44:56,378 --> 00:44:57,051
[laughs]

758
00:44:57,289 --> 00:44:57,776
Come on, walk.

759
00:44:59,954 --> 00:45:02,039
Seems like someone chained him again.

760
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:05,013
My life became like a beat constable
by roaming around with you.

761
00:45:05,165 --> 00:45:07,825
Is it mutton-head curry,
Saidulu? It smells delicious.

762
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:09,120
Won't you change your ways?

763
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:11,380
If you keep fooling around like this,

764
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:15,144
someone would click your photo and
upload it on the Facebook titled 'rapist'.

765
00:45:15,543 --> 00:45:17,848
When will you realise
about the meaning of life?

766
00:45:18,305 --> 00:45:19,602
Have you gone mad?

767
00:45:19,698 --> 00:45:21,661
Are you proud that you own a garage?

768
00:45:21,778 --> 00:45:23,287
Shut up and remove my shackles.

769
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:26,348
Otherwise,
I'll upload the photos of you and me.

770
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:26,946
How can I open it?

771
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:29,345
Ask him. He's eating curd-rice.

772
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:30,643
Raju, come fast.

773
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,541
As if that is my regular duty, bro!

774
00:45:33,894 --> 00:45:36,338
Hey, just eat your food silently. Idiot!

775
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,359
-Sada...
-Yes.

776
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,244
Let me tell you something.

777
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:40,617
Don't roam with him.
Otherwise, you'll end up like him.

778
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,860
Actually, I want to transform him like me.

779
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:48,301
Bro... Like you?
Please don't that. I'm good.

780
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,003
I can't talk to the walls
sitting inside the room.

781
00:45:53,097 --> 00:45:54,967
-Hey, go and remove his shackles.
-Come on, remove them.

782
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:55,544
Come...

783
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:00,568
If there is a problem in your thesis,
it means that it is inside you.

784
00:46:00,995 --> 00:46:02,335
You don't understand
it despite I tell you.

785
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:03,784
With honey, sir.

786
00:46:03,938 --> 00:46:04,704
I know!

787
00:46:04,904 --> 00:46:05,478
Daddy.

788
00:46:05,698 --> 00:46:07,161
It is time for the wedding.

789
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:08,440
We need to start within an hour at least.

790
00:46:08,494 --> 00:46:09,790
-Honey...-Okay.

791
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:10,879
I'll come. Get ready.

792
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:13,254
Madam, I've kept ready your
saree and blouse in your room.

793
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:14,188
Okay. Thank you.

794
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:16,070
-Sai
-Sir...

795
00:46:16,254 --> 00:46:19,324
Iron my clothes and keep them ready.
I have to attend a wedding.

796

Why does he link it to seasonal fruits?

797
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,217
I understood something.

798
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:27,272
We need to own the PhD first.

799
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:28,990
Then, everything will fall in line.

you saw the girl, right?

-You!

I just sang. That's it.

This is how I wanted you to be.

817

If you be happy like this,
I'll give you whatever you want for free.

818
00:47:17,507 --> 00:47:19,860
Seems like you had a good
time playing violin in college?

819
00:47:20,364 --> 00:47:23,050
Yes. I have to thank you for that.

820
00:47:24,168 --> 00:47:25,172
What about you?

821
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,595
Well... Mine is as usual.

822
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:32,152
My professor cancelled my thesis
for not getting him seasonal fruits.

823

How many guys in this
world are sincere like you?

824
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:40,413
I don't care about the world.

825

Hmm...

828
00:47:52,171 --> 00:47:55,226
You are a traditional girl who
would be around 23 to 24 years old.

829

You are having appropriate height.

You have swarthy complexion.

You have long hair
and play the violin as well.

Hmm...

833
00:48:04,558 --> 00:48:07,018
I am not swarthy. I'm fair-skinned.

Handsome?

Actually, my friend Raghu says so.

842

The joy of sound is of another level!

Why are you looking in a new manner?

856
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,472
As per the happiness on your face,
you might have won 100 crores lottery.

857
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:17,012
Otherwise, you might have
accomplished the silent-engine.

858

Yes, it is a girl.

We've been talking to each other

this but she said something similar.

00:49:47,222 --> 00:49:48,449
Hey, some guy like you

874
00:49:48,664 --> 00:49:50,994
has been holding a liquor bottle in his
armpit while roaming around wine shops.

875
00:49:51,387 --> 00:49:52,525
Tell me if you have any idea about it.

876
00:49:53,472 --> 00:49:54,174
Please.

877
00:49:54,393 --> 00:49:56,275
I'll give you an idea. Will you listen?

878
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,167
How many years it has been since you
have started building a silent engine?

879
00:50:03,972 --> 00:50:04,734
Seven years.

880
00:50:04,908 --> 00:50:06,226
What have you achieved?

881
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:09,138
I've been trying but it's been failing.

882
00:50:09,732 --> 00:50:10,638
There was a recent failure as well.

883
00:50:10,846 --> 00:50:12,745
Do you really need a girl right now?

884
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,141
Tell me, do you want to become like Raghu?

885
00:50:21,654 --> 00:50:22,275
Come on, tell me.

886
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:25,488
What's there to tell?
I'll work on the engine.

887
00:50:30,037 --> 00:50:31,871
Violin... Violin...

888
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:35,085
Why are you silent?

889
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:38,490
Why do you ask?
Is my silence troubling you?

890
00:50:40,553 --> 00:50:44,053
A girl made me realise that
I'd be happy about sound.

891
00:50:45,117 --> 00:50:48,164
Nothing like that.
You've been immersed in your work.

892
00:50:48,469 --> 00:50:51,154
I've been trying this formula for
soundless engines since a long time.

893
00:50:51,337 --> 00:50:52,880
My thesis is about soundless engines.

894
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:53,679
You carry on.

895
00:50:54,336 --> 00:50:55,324
Shall I help?

896
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,111
I'll be glad if that happens.

897
00:51:06,686 --> 00:51:12,404
[playing violin]

898
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:53,702
Yeah!

899
00:51:54,187 --> 00:51:56,150
Violin, thank you! Thank you so much!

900
00:51:56,235 --> 00:51:57,013
What happened?

901
00:51:58,437 --> 00:52:00,054
I got this solved due to your music.

902
00:52:00,178 --> 00:52:01,645
I've been trying that since a
long time and it got solved now.

903
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:04,861
Bro... Bro...

904
00:52:05,336 --> 00:52:08,359
He's been swinging me...

905
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:13,802
Hey, didn't I tell you?

906
00:52:14,951 --> 00:52:17,256
-It took seven years.
-Congratulations, dude.

907
00:52:17,415 --> 00:52:18,606
Thanks, doctor.

908
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:22,386
You have ultimately muted the
sound as per your ambition.

909
00:52:23,138 --> 00:52:25,925
Hey, go and talk to the girl
who stays beyond your wall.

910
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,895
Your girlfriend.

911
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:27,807
Now is the right time.

912
00:52:28,296 --> 00:52:30,136
You've somehow got tuned
to her violin, right?

913
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,156
Right?

914
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,865
Will she meet me?

915
00:52:33,936 --> 00:52:36,912
Which girl wouldn't like to meet a guy
at this time? Every girl would meet.

916
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:39,128
Go.

917
00:52:39,682 --> 00:52:41,471
-Are you sure?
-Just go.

918
00:52:42,525 --> 00:52:44,809
Go, bro. Success is yours.

919
00:53:06,134 --> 00:53:09,306
Today in my office, everyone
got impressed by my clothing.

920
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:12,113
They asked me which brand it was.

921
00:53:12,763 --> 00:53:14,320
Not this one.

922
00:53:14,452 --> 00:53:16,360
They didn't believe when I told them
that I have bought it for 400 rupees.

923
00:53:17,118 --> 00:53:19,408
They have argued that it won't
be be less than 2000 rupees.

924
00:53:20,803 --> 00:53:21,875
What do you say, Siri?

925
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:26,231
Even, I find it unbelievable.

926
00:53:27,686 --> 00:53:28,570
Are you okay?

927
00:53:29,021 --> 00:53:30,494
My colleague Ramana...

928
00:53:30,754 --> 00:53:33,875
Oh man! Please, it is boring. Why do
you want to talk about your office here?

929
00:53:35,034 --> 00:53:36,546
I cooked today.

930
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:37,936
Hmm... Nice!

931
00:53:39,021 --> 00:53:39,944
Is it bad?

932
00:53:40,154 --> 00:53:40,597
That's not the case.

933
00:53:40,795 --> 00:53:43,587
-Today in the office...
-Oh please, don't start it again.

934
00:53:49,515 --> 00:53:50,077
Oh!

935
00:53:52,108 --> 00:53:55,099
Okay... Since you like this,
eating this would lighten your mood.

936
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:56,019
Have it, Siri.

937
00:53:58,516 --> 00:54:00,988
Hmph! I've been trying to tell you
something since last half an hour.

938
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:02,600
-Don't you get it?
-Don't talk to me like that.

939
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:05,961
My colleague flattering my MD and now,
he's troubling me.

940
00:54:06,096 --> 00:54:07,387
When I want to tell these things to
you, you'd cite that they are boring.

941
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,396
Aren't you bothered about my matters?

942
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,234
As if you bother about my matters.

943
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:12,820
Damn!

944
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:15,228
Have you ever asked me
what's happening in my life?

945
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:18,783
Hari, I'll leave.

946
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:21,088
Damn!

947
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:29,116
[door opens]

948
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:34,612
Where have you been?

949
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,392
I've been to my friend's house.

950
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:39,305
Why?

951
00:54:40,593 --> 00:54:44,727
Nothing. As you are my neighbour,
I just wanted to know where you have been.

952
00:54:45,006 --> 00:54:46,958
I'm back, so tell me.

953
00:54:50,717 --> 00:54:54,369
Even I have felt like you in your absence.

954
00:54:54,744 --> 00:54:57,318
I felt some kind of loneliness
which I never felt before.

955
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,599
I'm unable to explain it.

956
00:55:01,905 --> 00:55:02,769
Same feeling,

957
00:55:05,565 --> 00:55:07,333
as if I'm missing something.

958
00:55:07,664 --> 00:55:09,346
Exactly! Likewise.

959
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,709
We didn't meet each other

960
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:15,852
but we do know about each other.

961
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:21,001
We... Shall we meet?

962
00:55:28,614 --> 00:55:31,309
Well, if you don't like
meeting me, then leave it.

963
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:35,552
Well, that's not the case.
I do want to meet you.

964
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:41,648
But let's be like this,
know and

965
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:43,202
understand each other.

966
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,667
How long should we be doing that?

967
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:50,162
Until we know so much about each other.

968
00:55:50,862 --> 00:55:55,516
It should be to such an extent that
there'd be no lifelong disturbances.

969
00:56:00,634 --> 00:56:02,124
Will you remain like that?

970
00:56:05,337 --> 00:56:06,030
Forever!

971
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:14,617
Greetings, Bhadram bro.

972
00:56:15,056 --> 00:56:16,944
-Greetings.
-You are looking awesome.

973
00:56:17,103 --> 00:56:20,454
-New bike, new shirt...
-Stop it! Nothing is new inside.

974
00:56:20,528 --> 00:56:22,175
Why so? Isn't your family
not taking good care of you?

975
00:56:22,328 --> 00:56:24,980
Of course, they are taking good
care. But I'm taking care of them.

976
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,894
-You are taking care of them?
-Hmm...

977
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:27,660
Why so?

978
00:56:28,048 --> 00:56:31,207
I got lured by their whopping dowry and
chose to go as a matrilocal son-in-law.

979
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,910
And they made me a servant.

980
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:38,937
Upon waking up, I have to serve
coffee to my wife and her mother.

981
00:56:39,148 --> 00:56:40,638
I've been cooking food
and doing household chores...

982
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,879
and been carrying a bottle
of petrol with me too!

983
00:56:43,225 --> 00:56:44,177
What kind of torture is this!

984
00:56:44,656 --> 00:56:46,913
Don't cry... Don't cry... Be brave.

985
00:56:48,282 --> 00:56:48,764
Well, bro...

986
00:56:48,945 --> 00:56:50,506
Is there something wrong with the
bike that you came early in the morning?

987
00:56:51,376 --> 00:56:53,702
I got carried away in my sorrows
and forgot to tell you why I'm here.

988
00:56:54,605 --> 00:56:57,165
Come here. Come, bro.

989
00:56:57,582 --> 00:56:58,415
Start this.

990
00:56:58,636 --> 00:56:59,389
-This one?
-Yes.

991
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,284
[bike starts]

992
00:57:03,641 --> 00:57:05,501
-Did the light glow?
-No.

993
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:09,283
-Check now.
-It is glowing.

994
00:57:09,456 --> 00:57:09,913
Yeah...

995
00:57:10,578 --> 00:57:12,810
The manufacturer of that
bike has installed everything

996
00:57:13,371 --> 00:57:16,139
except putting a switch to that light.

997
00:57:16,483 --> 00:57:17,106
[laughs]

998
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:19,352
That's my problem.

999
00:57:20,622 --> 00:57:22,010
Bro, do you know how it seems?

1000
00:57:22,468 --> 00:57:24,895
It is as if handing the bike
keys to the bus conductor.

1001
00:57:25,852 --> 00:57:27,997
-What shall I do, bro?
-Come on, bro.

1002
00:57:28,205 --> 00:57:30,751
They are new models in
the market. BS-4 model.

1003
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:32,106
A switch is not needed for that.

1004
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:35,600
The bulb would be glowing day and night.

1005
00:57:36,087 --> 00:57:38,413
Even I was told the same
by the showroom executive.

1006
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:41,120
Do you know what my wife said to
me when I have conveyed the same?

1007
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:45,068
"Who is the hell is he to avoid a switch?
You go, get it installed."

1008
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:45,682
Come on, install the switch.

1009
00:57:45,784 --> 00:57:47,652
I won't do that. It is not required
and cannot be installed as well.

1010
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:48,509
Never mind.

1011
00:57:48,623 --> 00:57:50,591
Bro, don't be kidding.
Listen to me.

1012
00:57:50,976 --> 00:57:52,248
Your problem is not the bike.

1013
00:57:52,984 --> 00:57:54,976
You, along with your wife,

1014
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:58,210
shall attend the marriage
counselling TV programmes.

1015
00:57:58,612 --> 00:58:02,085
All your problems will be settled there.

1016
00:58:02,194 --> 00:58:03,981
-Can you promise me about that?
-I swear it would work.

1017
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:06,150
Hey, what's with you?

1018
00:58:06,238 --> 00:58:08,844
Bro, you have taken this citing necessary.
But why have you brought it back?

1019
00:58:09,248 --> 00:58:11,967
Well... I think I'm losing
interest on nuts and bolts.

1020
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:12,726
Ah!

1021
00:58:13,729 --> 00:58:16,849
Why are your eyes glittering
like the brightest star, bro?

1022
00:58:17,123 --> 00:58:18,830
-Is it?
-I understood by looking at your eyes.

1023
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:20,437
Seems like your engine has started.

1024
00:58:22,393 --> 00:58:23,602
-Here
-Just 10 rupees?

1025
00:58:24,229 --> 00:58:24,915
Have tea.

1026
00:58:38,131 --> 00:58:41,962
"The eyes are getting converged"

1027
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:45,642
"The hearts are getting closer"

1028
00:58:45,828 --> 00:58:49,200
"The bodies are setting out for desire"

1029
00:58:49,388 --> 00:58:53,363
"And our pasts have gone into delirium"

1030
00:58:53,515 --> 00:58:57,025
"The tranquillity is
turning into loquacity"

1031
00:58:57,275 --> 00:59:00,859
"The petulance is playing games"

1032
00:59:01,132 --> 00:59:04,647
"The hearts are gossiping"

1033
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:08,688
"And are trying to establish a connection"

1034
00:59:08,788 --> 00:59:12,666
"Yesterday's bruise in my
heart turned into a song today"

1035
00:59:12,713 --> 00:59:16,089
"My youth is coming
for you like a shadow"

1036
00:59:16,414 --> 00:59:18,412
"My lips are calling for you"

1037
00:59:18,483 --> 00:59:20,286
"They have preserved nectar for you"

1038
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,991
"And my life would be gratifying"

1039
00:59:24,168 --> 00:59:27,949
"The breath inside me"

1040
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:31,556
"have called for you"

1041
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:35,651
"I laid my concentration on you"

1042
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:39,417
"and lost myself"

1043
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:57,428
Damn! What shall we do now?

1044
00:59:57,706 --> 01:00:00,351
Superb!
Let's have a candlelight dinner.

1045
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,129
[snaps] Good idea!

1046
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:15,835
Wow!

1047
01:00:16,986 --> 01:00:17,577
How is it?

1048
01:00:19,604 --> 01:00:20,491
Ow!

1049
01:00:21,078 --> 01:00:21,708
What happened?

1050
01:00:23,273 --> 01:00:25,413
My tongue got burnt due to hot soup.

1051
01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:26,330
Soup?

1052
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,301
Oh!

1053
01:00:27,883 --> 01:00:29,074
We made sizzler, right?

1054
01:00:29,484 --> 01:00:31,034
I did as per your instruction...

1055
01:00:34,261 --> 01:00:34,871
But...

1056
01:00:37,579 --> 01:00:38,368
What now?

1057
01:00:38,716 --> 01:00:39,654
No problem.

1058
01:00:39,953 --> 01:00:42,303
You... please eat.

1059
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,365
Hey... you could be open.

1060
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:45,666
Okay.

1061
01:00:46,466 --> 01:00:47,578
This treat was meant to be for you.

1062
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,006
How can you not eat?

1063
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,806
You have your soup and I'd have
some juice. Let me get some.

1064
01:00:54,577 --> 01:00:55,990
Juice is healthier than a sizzler anyway.

1065
01:00:57,748 --> 01:00:58,748
Just juice?

1066
01:00:58,948 --> 01:00:59,965
Just juice is boring.

1067
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:01,329
Has a lot of calories.

1068
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:06,293
Add a little vodka to dilute it.

1069
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:14,181
Not just being alone...

1070
01:01:16,928 --> 01:01:18,486
Someone's company could be really great...

1071
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:21,773
I just came to know about it.

1072
01:01:33,431 --> 01:01:34,222
Madam...

1073
01:01:34,643 --> 01:01:35,744
-Madam!
-Huh?

1074
01:01:42,267 --> 01:01:43,609
Enjoy your meal madam.

1075
01:01:44,192 --> 01:01:45,587
I'll get dessert if you want.

1076
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:48,295

1081
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:16,015
Mom, tell me...

1082
01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:17,196
How are you?

1083
01:02:17,465 --> 01:02:19,021
I'm good. How is Dad?

1084
01:02:19,484 --> 01:02:20,954
Dad might have gone for a walk.

1085
01:02:21,881 --> 01:02:22,717
What are you upto?

1086
01:02:22,917 --> 01:02:24,503
Nothing, just the plaits.

1087
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:26,330
But you don't know how to weave plaits!

1088
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:30,192
I might not do it as perfectly as you do,
but I manage.

1089
01:02:30,392 --> 01:02:33,374
You don't know anything. I Wonder
what you are cooking for yourself.

1090
01:02:33,574 --> 01:02:36,812
Well I'm learning,
but the semester exams are ahead.

1091
01:02:38,042 --> 01:02:40,287
I'm planning to play your tune on violin.

1092
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:43,140
Okay Mom, I'm leaving for college.

1093
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,105
Okay? Bye.

1094
01:02:44,305 --> 01:02:45,535
Okay, bye dear.

1095
01:02:47,707 --> 01:02:48,911
Is your mother a musician?

1096
01:02:52,486 --> 01:02:54,277
Well, I heard some sounds at night?

1097
01:02:55,543 --> 01:02:59,298
Well... I had juice as
you were having soup.

1098
01:02:59,801 --> 01:03:03,038
But there's something about hunger,
it doesn't let you sleep.

1099
01:03:04,102 --> 01:03:06,036
So I ate the sizzlers.

1100
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,766
Okay, I'm about to leave now.

1101
01:03:08,938 --> 01:03:09,884
Violin!

1102
01:03:10,168 --> 01:03:11,315
You didn't answer my question!

1103
01:03:11,444 --> 01:03:13,393
Yeah...
she was a good musician.

1104
01:03:13,661 --> 01:03:14,441
But once upon a time.

1105
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:16,478
My father didn't support
her career after marriage.

1106
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:18,767
That's okay. Atleast he is supporting you!

1107
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:21,215
Okay, bye.

1108
01:03:21,386 --> 01:03:22,291
Bye.

1109
01:03:28,023 --> 01:03:29,769
We have to wind up buying vegetables soon.

1110
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:31,971
Okay, you be on it. I'll just look around.

1111
01:03:32,171 --> 01:03:33,026
Hey!

1112
01:03:33,812 --> 01:03:34,817
Don't fool around.

1113
01:03:35,017 --> 01:03:38,259
-Got to get back and be on the project.
-Ah! As if you're completing it today!

1114
01:03:38,873 --> 01:03:40,087

-100 rupees per KG.

1116
01:03:45,132 --> 01:03:47,096
-What? Say it aloud?
-Hundred rupees.

1117
01:03:47,505 --> 01:03:50,691
Whats up? You've started to
ask people to speak aloud!

1118
01:03:50,891 --> 01:03:52,585
-What's happening?
-Oh, come on...

1119
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,698
Hey... isn't he Biscuit Sai?

1120
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:58,215
Biscuit Sai?

1121
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,300
The Sai who studies
first year man. It's him.

1122
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:07,024
You know he almost works like a
servant at Professor Murthy's house.

1123
01:04:07,565 --> 01:04:09,611
-Is the colocasia tender?
-This time, he'd not just top the class

1124
01:04:10,397 --> 01:04:11,478
He'd bag the gold medal for sure.

1125
01:04:11,663 --> 01:04:14,259
Sir needs tender Gherkins,
tender cucumbers...

1126
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,073
and drumsticks too. Argh!

1127

-Who the hell is that?
-Oh my...

1128
01:04:17,902 --> 01:04:19,331
Oh it's you Raghu sir! Good morning!

1129
01:04:19,746 --> 01:04:22,618
Professor Murthy needs
Pumpkins at his age.

1130
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:24,801
-Oh no...
-Give him a glass of Pumpkin juice daily

1131
01:04:25,001 --> 01:04:26,538
and he would get some wisdom
to give us some marks.

1132
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:32,334
Anyway, you've got to sip some tea at the
tea stall reading the news at this time

1133
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:34,012
but why are you doing these chores?

1134
01:04:34,856 --> 01:04:36,351
I really pity you, kid.

1135
01:04:36,852 --> 01:04:38,878
You can't expect me to pursue PhD
for eight years like you, sir!

1136
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,453
Ah! You're mocking your
seniors, aren't you?

1137
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:44,111
Well, you won't listen to well wishers.

1138
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:46,268
Here... give him this.

1139

Uh?

1144
01:04:55,701 --> 01:04:57,808

-Hello.
-Greetings.

1146
01:05:18,975 --> 01:05:20,307

Why? Don't you see these are all fresh?

1148
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:24,332
The green chilli looks a bit greener!

1149
01:05:24,696 --> 01:05:26,697
Well the heat gave them the green.

Tomatoes are priced 400 rupees a Kilo.

1155
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,546
400? The old man is selling for 100!

1156
01:05:39,746 --> 01:05:42,442
Hey! She has decided the
price for the crop she grew.

1157
01:05:43,213 --> 01:05:46,168
Women empowerment isn't just the
subject of social media posts.

1158
01:05:46,612 --> 01:05:47,710
It has to be put to practice.

1159

What's the secret of your beauty?

1162

Carrots! Carrots give a lot of charm!

1163

Get going.

-Done with shopping?

01:06:37,521 --> 01:06:41,271
Well, the vegetables would be more
fresh if I could buy from your home.

01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:10,648
I feel feverish.

1393
01:18:12,923 --> 01:18:13,928
Can I...

1394
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,491
You are with me anyhow.

1395
01:18:17,691 --> 01:18:19,735
Yes I am. But...

1396
01:18:19,935 --> 01:18:21,327
Can you do me a favour?

1397
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:23,179
What is it?

1398
01:18:23,564 --> 01:18:24,994
Could you come closer?

1399
01:18:26,465 --> 01:18:27,444
Gives me some courage.

1400
01:18:28,152 --> 01:18:31,535
"Both hearts thump with the same life"

1401
01:18:31,859 --> 01:18:35,468
"To drive away the lasting
sorrow from my heart"

1402
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:39,554
"When would you show yourself to me?"

1403
01:18:39,952 --> 01:18:43,743
"When the light pierces in to my eyes"

1404
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:47,479
"I wait for that moment"

1405
01:18:47,941 --> 01:18:51,475
"I'm a loner..."

1406
01:18:51,841 --> 01:18:55,336
"...and this is my world"

1407
01:18:56,327 --> 01:19:02,286
"Are you the boon granted to my heart?"

1408
01:19:03,845 --> 01:19:09,112
"I felt the first feeling
of love today..."

1409
01:19:09,806 --> 01:19:11,782
"...because of you"

1410
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:15,568
"Time has stopped..."

1411
01:19:15,808 --> 01:19:19,480
"...since I saw you."

1412
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:23,181
"...since I saw you."

1413
01:19:51,645 --> 01:19:54,508
Being married, my life has
become that of a garage car.

1414
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:55,891
-What a plight!
-Come on strike!

1415
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:59,077
Obul Reddy will come now.
We both will discuss the matter.

1416
01:19:59,277 --> 01:20:01,613
None of you kids must interfere.
You may get hurt, mind you!

1417
01:20:01,813 --> 01:20:05,309
It not as easy as you shoplift
things. He will bash you black and blue

1418
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:06,778
-Are you trying to threaten me?
-Strike it man!

1419
01:20:06,978 --> 01:20:10,034
[bullet engine whirring]

1420
01:20:12,531 --> 01:20:14,542
Obul Reddy is here! Run everyone!

1421
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:28,313
Who is here in the shed man?

1422
01:20:30,419 --> 01:20:32,902
He ruined my bullet's sound.

1423
01:20:33,102 --> 01:20:36,288
Who the hell is
that scumbag?

1424
01:20:37,512 --> 01:20:41,117
Hey Raju! Are you deaf?

1425
01:20:41,764 --> 01:20:43,387
Is grease jammed in your ears?

1426
01:20:43,587 --> 01:20:45,464
You silly fellow!

1427
01:20:45,664 --> 01:20:49,375
Don't call me names bro. I feel very bad.

1428
01:20:49,698 --> 01:20:52,296
Hey there's so much fun
pulling someone's leg.

1429
01:20:52,496 --> 01:20:54,045
Yeah, I know how much fun it is for you.

1430
01:20:57,392 --> 01:21:00,967
Are you planning to hang
spanner and nuts in your hair?

1431
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,226
Style bro!

1432
01:21:02,426 --> 01:21:07,405
Style is it? Even you mouth is
overflowing, just shut it off.

1433
01:21:08,685 --> 01:21:10,213
-Hey Lakshman...
-Yes bro...

1434
01:21:10,413 --> 01:21:12,307
Didn't you shave your birth hair?

1435
01:21:12,507 --> 01:21:16,429
Not really, my dad asked me to
grow it as it is our family tradition to.

1436
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:19,207
Tradition is it? Sounds
interesting, tell more about it.

1437
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:20,751
Should I?

1438
01:21:20,951 --> 01:21:24,615
"If it goes Grey, you can always dye"

1439
01:21:24,815 --> 01:21:28,019
"If it sheds off, it might
cost you heavy to buy a wig"

1440
01:21:28,963 --> 01:21:32,466
"The bald man worries
as he doesn't have hair"

1441
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:36,443
"The one with long hair
worries about tangles"

1442
01:21:37,687 --> 01:21:41,002
"It accompanies us in birth and death"

1443
01:21:41,202 --> 01:21:44,489
"What is wrong in growing it?
Utmost it might fall, that's it!"

1444
01:21:44,689 --> 01:21:45,734
Is it a sin to grow it?

1445
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:48,640
Whoa! What a song bro!

1446
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:52,782
Sang it very well! But you have
to cut it before my next visit.

1447
01:21:52,982 --> 01:21:56,404
Else I will send you to some
temple and get it shaved there.

1448
01:21:56,604 --> 01:21:57,377
Do you get it?

1449
01:21:57,578 --> 01:22:01,092
[phone ringing]

1450
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:03,057
Keep shaking this!

1451
01:22:03,257 --> 01:22:05,045
Why should I shake it?

1452
01:22:05,985 --> 01:22:08,090
Baby where are you?

1453
01:22:09,352 --> 01:22:12,113
What? On the bike?

1454
01:22:12,313 --> 01:22:13,986
Didn't I tell you?

1455
01:22:15,274 --> 01:22:19,063
Didn't I say that I'd
book a cab for you?

1456
01:22:19,936 --> 01:22:22,431
Baby, you don't get it.

1457
01:22:22,631 --> 01:22:24,771
Do you know there's some
much of pollution outside?

1458
01:22:26,427 --> 01:22:29,395
Who told you baby? Please baby!

1459
01:22:29,595 --> 01:22:33,167
You are on a diet baby.

1460
01:22:35,009 --> 01:22:37,915
You please don't feel
shy in telling such things.

1461
01:22:38,115 --> 01:22:41,898
I will order food online,
it will be delivered to home.

1462
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:46,144
Baby, never repeat such things.

1463
01:22:46,744 --> 01:22:50,446
Ah! You didn't tie a scarf either?

1464
01:22:50,646 --> 01:22:53,413
That's the reason I get
angry with you at times.

1465
01:22:53,613 --> 01:22:55,973
Wrap a stole atleast.

1466
01:22:57,831 --> 01:23:02,666
I will come. I'll be there in an hour.

1467
01:23:02,866 --> 01:23:04,597
Five minutes please.

1468
01:23:07,463 --> 01:23:10,667
Please baby! Please! Ok see you!

1469
01:23:14,106 --> 01:23:16,746
Hey where did the doctor go?

1470
01:23:16,946 --> 01:23:19,829
Who the hell is that
braying like a donkey?

1471
01:23:22,172 --> 01:23:23,329
What is your problem man?

1472
01:23:23,529 --> 01:23:25,763
-How do I look to you?
-Why are you shouting?

1473
01:23:25,963 --> 01:23:27,676
They changed my bike's sound.

1474
01:23:27,876 --> 01:23:30,350
It's sounding odd.

1475
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:32,384
Don't I look funny then?

1476
01:23:32,584 --> 01:23:33,962
What is that bottle in your hand?

1477
01:23:34,162 --> 01:23:36,139
Juice! Shake it, you
will know it yourself.

1478
01:23:36,339 --> 01:23:39,890
I shook many such ones! They
are lying outside the garage now.

1479
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,365
What do you need?

1480
01:23:41,565 --> 01:23:43,060
The sound has changed.

1481
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,343
Will you keep quiet
if it was your bike?

1482
01:23:45,543 --> 01:23:48,161
Raju, look into his
issue and shut his mouth.

1483
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:51,472
Change the bike's silencer,
people are finding it funny.

1484
01:23:51,672 --> 01:23:54,752
-Look into it man!
-Who spoiled my bike man?

1485
01:23:54,952 --> 01:23:56,272
Why do you ask me bro?

1486
01:23:56,472 --> 01:23:58,919
You look as small as a silencer, why do
you raise your voice man? Shake this!

1487
01:24:00,561 --> 01:24:01,124
Enough?

1488
01:24:01,324 --> 01:24:03,674
Everyone looks like dimwit here.

1489
01:24:03,874 --> 01:24:05,950
All brainless idiots!

1490
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:08,958
[phone ringing]

1491
01:24:09,754 --> 01:24:15,616
My sweetest baby! Why
did you call me again?

1492
01:24:15,816 --> 01:24:19,665
Who is he? You wretched
woman! Just stay put!

1493
01:24:27,905 --> 01:24:29,210
[door bell rings]

1494
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,280
Dad...

1495
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,793
Please come!

1496
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,353
Mom didn't mention
about your arrival at all.

1497
01:24:45,553 --> 01:24:48,323
I just wanted to see you, so here I am.

1498
01:24:52,266 --> 01:24:53,969
I would have come to the
station to pick you up.

1499
01:24:54,169 --> 01:24:58,875
It's ok dear, You look weak. Why do
you stay up all night? Sleep early.

1500
01:25:00,765 --> 01:25:04,133
I got drenched in the rain, had fever too.

1501
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:08,718
You must have done it
deliberately, I know you.

1502
01:25:08,918 --> 01:25:12,430
We elders always say
keeping your welfare in mind.

1503
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:16,967
You first freshen up! We
shall have breakfast together. Come!

1504
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:24,801
-Do you have classes today?
-Do you have to talk to me?

1505
01:25:25,001 --> 01:25:28,005
It's ok, we can talk once
you come back from college.

1506
01:25:28,205 --> 01:25:29,560
Hmm ok.

1507
01:25:30,112 --> 01:25:32,847
Have you learned to cook too?

1508
01:25:34,305 --> 01:25:36,257
Just trying my hands on.

1509
01:25:36,457 --> 01:25:39,597
It's the same with everything dear,
you'll find it difficult in the beginning

1510
01:25:39,797 --> 01:25:41,999
later, you yourself will get used to to.

1511
01:25:43,516 --> 01:25:46,004
Hmm! Superb! Upma tastes delicious.

1512
01:25:47,603 --> 01:25:48,647
Thanks dad.

1513
01:25:56,353 --> 01:25:58,632
-Dad, I'm going to college.
-Hmm!

1514
01:25:58,832 --> 01:26:00,458
-Bye dear!
-Bye!

1515
01:26:01,128 --> 01:26:01,933
[mouths 'bye']

1516
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,729
Coffee!

1517
01:26:15,243 --> 01:26:17,412
Arya... Coffee!

1518
01:26:27,623 --> 01:26:29,462
Is you love towards me lessening?

1519
01:26:30,562 --> 01:26:32,132
Or are you just being fed up of me?

1520
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:34,016
I should ask you that?

1521
01:26:34,216 --> 01:26:37,751
-You are not like the old-times Arya!
-I am just the same then and now too.

1522
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:40,987
Its been so long since we spoke happily?

1523
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:46,585
You never left to work
without dropping me at my office.

1524
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:50,321
You used to eat my favorite
dishes when you were hungry.

1525
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:52,375
But now...

1526
01:26:54,481 --> 01:26:56,765
You forgot the day
we both first met.

1527
01:26:56,965 --> 01:27:00,238
These may seem to be petty things

1528
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:06,091
but these are enough to say that the
distance between our hearts is growing

1529
01:27:09,755 --> 01:27:12,059
Love should grow if
we are living together.

1530
01:27:14,114 --> 01:27:18,691
But the for us,
the distance is growing, Arya.

1531
01:27:21,649 --> 01:27:22,891
You should know the reason for it.

1532
01:27:23,091 --> 01:27:26,076
Not just me. You too give it a thought.

1533
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:29,692
But what is the
problem between us?

1534
01:27:32,936 --> 01:27:36,730
If you find living with me is problematic,
you decide whether you want to or not.

1535
01:27:40,684 --> 01:27:42,185
[door closes]

1536
01:27:42,385 --> 01:27:45,390
Dad... Dad...

1537
01:27:46,863 --> 01:27:49,144
-Dad...
-Sireesha...

1538
01:27:54,787 --> 01:27:56,032
My dad...

1539
01:27:58,580 --> 01:27:59,972
Did you speak to my dad?

1540
01:28:01,811 --> 01:28:02,908
Ah Lakshmi...

1541
01:28:03,108 --> 01:28:04,912
You first listen to me.

1542
01:28:05,112 --> 01:28:06,377
I came to Sireesha.

1543
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:09,685
I will bring her home
saying that you are unwell.

1544
01:28:09,962 --> 01:28:12,256
-Do you get it?
-I mean...

1545
01:28:12,456 --> 01:28:14,837
This is a very good match in all means.

1546
01:28:15,237 --> 01:28:18,534
Argh! You just don't talk anything else!

1547
01:28:18,734 --> 01:28:20,408
Varun got a chance to go to the USA.

1548
01:28:20,608 --> 01:28:22,764
They are planning to perform
the wedding before he leaves.

1549
01:28:23,824 --> 01:28:27,488
I'm her father after all. I would
always wish for my daughter's good life

1550
01:28:27,688 --> 01:28:28,787
but nothing else!

1551
01:28:30,189 --> 01:28:32,136
Once she gets used to it, she
would then start liking it too.

1552
01:28:32,618 --> 01:28:34,131
Everything seems odd
until one gets used to it.

1553
01:28:34,331 --> 01:28:35,398
[loud noise]

1554
01:28:35,598 --> 01:28:37,822
Looks like there's an earth
quake here. Will call you later.

1555
01:28:42,589 --> 01:28:43,826
-[panting]
-Hello!

1556
01:28:44,026 --> 01:28:46,203
Don't ghosts scare you?
Only earth quakes do?

1557
01:28:47,618 --> 01:28:50,593
Hey who is that speaking
from behind the wall?

1558
01:28:50,793 --> 01:28:53,028
Though I speak from behind the
wall, I don't lie like you.

1559
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:55,707
Will a father ever lie to her daughter?

1560
01:28:55,907 --> 01:28:58,524
Who the hell are you to talk
about it? How does it concern you?

1561
01:29:00,691 --> 01:29:03,686
You didn't understand dad
and daughter's relationship.

1562
01:29:06,114 --> 01:29:07,870
How will you understand our relationship?

1563
01:29:10,204 --> 01:29:12,613
Your daughter has a goal,
support her if you can.

1564
01:29:14,178 --> 01:29:15,796
But do not spoil it.

1565
01:29:15,996 --> 01:29:17,879
You first mind your own business.

1566
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:19,460
Else I may have to call the police.

1567
01:29:20,987 --> 01:29:22,653
Police?

1568
01:29:23,707 --> 01:29:25,165
What else can you do?

1569
01:29:27,852 --> 01:29:29,921
You ruined you wife's interests
then and now your daughter's.

1570
01:29:30,184 --> 01:29:33,979
Hey, my wife is happy.
And my daughter...

1571
01:29:34,179 --> 01:29:36,295
She promised
me before joining this course,

1572
01:29:36,495 --> 01:29:38,022
that once she finishes her course...

1573
01:29:38,222 --> 01:29:40,617
she'd marry her cousin as
per our word. Do you get it?

1574
01:29:43,783 --> 01:29:48,569
What? Did she promise you
that she'd marry her cousin?

1575
01:29:48,769 --> 01:29:49,937
Yes!

1576
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:05,297
A lot of times I wanted to tell you...

1577
01:30:05,497 --> 01:30:06,459
Then why didn't you tell me?

1578
01:30:11,037 --> 01:30:12,664
Then why didn't you tell me?

1579
01:30:16,173 --> 01:30:18,797
Then why did we have to get to
know each other? What was it all for?

1580
01:30:22,868 --> 01:30:24,287
But whom am I to question you?

1581
01:30:24,487 --> 01:30:26,111
You don't know my
name and whom am I.

1582
01:30:26,311 --> 01:30:29,632
I'm just your company as you
stay alone. Just a time pass!

1583
01:30:32,403 --> 01:30:33,859
To the best of my knowledge,
your course was also a time pass.

1584
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:36,597
You just bluffed saying
it was your mother's dream.

1585
01:30:36,797 --> 01:30:38,774
No...

1586
01:30:38,974 --> 01:30:41,415
Please listen to me...

1587
01:30:46,627 --> 01:30:52,142
That is why I don't like your
world. I will live in my own world.

1588
01:31:04,942 --> 01:31:06,555
I have been telling you the same.

1589
01:31:07,457 --> 01:31:10,188
That's not love.
How can you call it love?

1590
01:31:10,388 --> 01:31:13,430
As you've been living with nuts and
bolts for years, you just felt lonely.

1591
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:17,758
In that moment, when she appeared
there, you just got attracted. That's all.

1592
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:22,707
You don't believe it? Just tell me what
have you fell for her? Her nose or eyes?

1593
01:31:22,907 --> 01:31:25,872
Moreover you keep calling each other
with funny names like silencer and violin.

1594
01:31:26,072 --> 01:31:27,520
-Sireesha!
-What?

1595
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,297
Her name is Sireesha!

1596
01:31:29,497 --> 01:31:31,247
What a wierd name is that?
That of a daily soap actress!

1597
01:31:31,447 --> 01:31:35,178
You! You are just like Lord Buddha!

1598
01:31:35,378 --> 01:31:39,731
You should stay detached! How
does her whereabouts matter you?

1599
01:31:40,619 --> 01:31:44,317
You just snap your fingers!
I will make girls line up for you!

1600
01:31:44,517 --> 01:31:45,524
Come on snap it man!

1601
01:31:45,724 --> 01:31:48,645
Yes! Do you want girls from
sociology, or political science?

1602
01:31:48,845 --> 01:31:51,168
or English? There are too many
girls in English specialization.

1603
01:31:51,477 --> 01:31:55,379
Why do you look here and there?
Listen to me. Who do you...

1604
01:31:55,579 --> 01:31:58,867
[phone rings]

1605
01:31:59,067 --> 01:32:00,737
I forgot to put it on silent mode.

1606
01:32:00,937 --> 01:32:05,906
Hello, I'm right here,
just beside the road.

1607
01:32:06,106 --> 01:32:08,054
I'm coming, just 2 minutes.

1608
01:32:08,254 --> 01:32:10,430
I am coming, just 2 minutes!

1609
01:32:11,785 --> 01:32:13,020
Ok bye bye!

1610
01:32:16,046 --> 01:32:21,402
Actually I didn't want to ask you.
I'm not sure how odd it sounds too

1611
01:32:21,648 --> 01:32:27,100
So if you can, I have my parents at
home. I can't drop the plan suddenly.

1612
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,963
Please don't look at me like that.
Just give me your house keys.

1613
01:32:30,163 --> 01:32:31,139
Damn!

1614
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:34,893
What is wrong in it?
What did Murthy say?

1615
01:32:35,093 --> 01:32:37,223
What goes around comes around.

1616
01:32:37,423 --> 01:32:40,114
That means if you help me for my
love, it will be helpful to your love.

1617
01:32:40,314 --> 01:32:41,872
Is yours love?

1618
01:32:42,072 --> 01:32:43,825
How could you say that?

1619
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:46,001
Love is the same for all.

1620
01:32:46,201 --> 01:32:48,575
Yeah it is!

1621
01:32:50,358 --> 01:32:51,776
People like you are right!

1622
01:32:51,976 --> 01:32:54,761
Here, take the keys,
and take the girl you like too. Go!

1623
01:32:54,961 --> 01:32:55,817
Thank you Buddha!

1624
01:32:56,017 --> 01:32:57,335
Bro, serve him double peg!

1625
01:33:01,070 --> 01:33:04,114

1626

[smashes]

1628
01:33:32,514 --> 01:33:35,607
-Silen...-Please, one second, listen to me.

1629
01:33:35,807 --> 01:33:38,201
-Hold on! Please!
-Shh!

1630
01:33:38,401 --> 01:33:41,386
What is this? Just get up!

1631
01:33:41,986 --> 01:33:43,460
Please listen to me.

1632
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:47,745
[indistinct chatter]

1633
01:33:47,945 --> 01:33:50,074
Listen, move! Get away.

1634
01:33:57,222 --> 01:33:58,198
One moment.
[Door thuds]

1635
01:33:58,398 --> 01:33:59,546
What happened?

1636
01:33:59,746 --> 01:34:02,037
-I heard some sound.
-I didn't hear anything.

1637
01:34:02,237 --> 01:34:03,298
Why would you? Get up!

1638
01:34:03,498 --> 01:34:05,526
-I shouldn't hear too.
-Raghu please!

1639
01:34:05,726 --> 01:34:09,486
[sighs] Ok sit up!

1640
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:11,151
Wait please!

1641
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:23,878
-What is it, tell me?
-Check out for yourself.

1642
01:34:29,286 --> 01:34:30,127
Hmm?

1643
01:34:40,355 --> 01:34:42,063
-For me?
-Hmm!

1644
01:34:44,236 --> 01:34:46,262
For you! How is it?

1645
01:34:55,808 --> 01:34:56,793
Didn't you like it?

1646
01:35:01,877 --> 01:35:03,995
I always gifted others,
but never really received one.

1647
01:35:04,195 --> 01:35:06,171
So I grabbed that lucky chance!

1648
01:35:06,371 --> 01:35:07,534
Hmm?

1649
01:35:11,266 --> 01:35:12,190
What happened?

1650
01:35:14,341 --> 01:35:18,958
I... I have some work!

1651
01:35:19,158 --> 01:35:21,463
-Shall we go?
-What happened?

1652
01:35:23,758 --> 01:35:24,554
Raghu...

1653
01:35:39,761 --> 01:35:41,936
[sighs]
[door closes]

1654
01:35:42,136 --> 01:35:43,468
Was she good?

1655
01:35:43,968 --> 01:35:46,620
Are you done? So soon?

1656
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:48,818
Hey what are you talking?

1657
01:35:49,318 --> 01:35:52,329
I agree it is a mistake not to
tell you something important.

1658
01:35:52,529 --> 01:35:54,683
So will you get a girl home for that?

1659
01:35:56,991 --> 01:36:00,625
Girl... Which girl are you talking about?

1660
01:36:00,825 --> 01:36:05,474
Yeah, you are a very
innocent boy! Lord Buddha!

1661
01:36:05,674 --> 01:36:10,308
You know nothing about the girl or
the kisses! I didn't hear anything.

1662
01:36:10,508 --> 01:36:15,122
For what you've done, I should
have broken this wall and bashed you

1663
01:36:15,322 --> 01:36:17,339
Hey, that was not me!

1664
01:36:17,539 --> 01:36:19,406
Yeah, not you! A ghost!

1665
01:36:19,606 --> 01:36:22,171
Woman turned into a ghost again.

1666
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:24,954
It was Raghuram not me.

1667
01:36:25,779 --> 01:36:28,175
Will you blame Raghuram to cover it up?

1668
01:36:30,266 --> 01:36:31,795
Things wouldn't have come this
far, if you had understood me.

1669
01:36:31,995 --> 01:36:35,293
True, as though you
understood me very well.

1670
01:36:35,493 --> 01:36:36,890
Psch! Why do even talk to you!

1671
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:41,429
Yeah, when you have other
girls, why would you talk to me?

1672
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:44,209
Yes, I don't want to talk to you.

1673
01:36:44,892 --> 01:36:45,910
You too don't talk to me.

1674
01:36:46,769 --> 01:36:48,418
Get married to the guy your
dad chose for you and go away from here.

1675
01:36:49,712 --> 01:36:52,046
Fine, I will marry him.

1676
01:36:53,184 --> 01:36:54,217
Please do!

1677
01:36:54,812 --> 01:36:59,680
"Eyes are filled with tears"

1678
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:04,487
"Is this the wound inflicted by fate?"

"The dream of uniting
with each other is spoilt"

1680
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:15,491

01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:20,753
"After giving me company
and becoming so important"

1682
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:25,722
"Love has left me"

01:37:26,398 --> 01:37:31,266
"Any chance the pain could be cured"

1684
01:37:31,758 --> 01:37:36,379
"and the distance be lessed, oh love?"

1685
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:41,864
"So much that you became my world"

01:37:42,689 --> 01:37:47,505
"I dream of you every moment"

1687
01:37:47,996 --> 01:37:52,502
"You made me a loner now"

"Yet, I wait for you..."

1689
01:37:57,305 --> 01:38:00,032
Your project has been published in the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

1690
01:38:00,232 --> 01:38:02,733
We liked the project a lot.
We are ready to fund it.

1691
01:38:03,222 --> 01:38:04,262
Thank you, sir.

1692
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:07,294
-But I need some time.
-It's OK.

1693
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:11,511
Hey Sadha, what happened to you?

1694
01:38:12,089 --> 01:38:15,028
Why did you work hard day
and night for seven years?

1695
01:38:15,481 --> 01:38:18,408
Now is the time your dream is coming true.
It was your dream.

1696
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:19,887
I don't know.

Yes father...

1703
01:38:36,088 --> 01:38:36,928
Where are you, son?

1704
01:38:37,062 --> 01:38:39,703
-I came out on work.
-Why do you sound troubled, son?

1705
01:38:40,153 --> 01:38:41,856
Nothing, father. I'm good.

1706
01:38:42,056 --> 01:38:43,980
Come home for some days
if you don't feel good.

1707
01:38:44,403 --> 01:38:45,070
Okay, father.

1708
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:46,316
I will call you later.

Tsk!

1720
01:40:12,707 --> 01:40:16,772
Why don't you sit and talk with that girl?
It would clear the misunderstandings.

1721
01:40:17,389 --> 01:40:18,336
That's not possible.

1722
01:40:20,101 --> 01:40:21,283
She doesn't trust me.

1723

In the entirety of your life, when a
girl loved you as the person you are,

1724
01:40:26,481 --> 01:40:27,204
will you leave her?

1725
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:28,778
Hey, I didn't intend to leave her.

1726
01:40:28,939 --> 01:40:30,321
-Even, she didn't intend...
-Why not?

1727
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:32,587
She said that she'd marry her cousin
by doing her favourite course.

1728
01:40:34,087 --> 01:40:34,912
What kind of logic is that?

freedom before marriage.

freedom after marriage.

1731
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:46,389
She should inform me, right?
She should inform me, right?

1732
01:40:47,619 --> 01:40:49,332
Hmm... Is it?

1733
01:40:50,217 --> 01:40:54,939
Why did she feel bad when she thought
that you were with some girl in your room?

1734
01:41:00,658 --> 01:41:06,435
Hey, there won't be straight
answers for many things in life.

1735
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:10,964
If everything is discussed by sitting
together, it'd become business.

1736
01:41:11,744 --> 01:41:15,439
When one understands some
inexpressible things, that's love.

1737
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:26,014
How come you are talking about love?

1738
01:41:30,409 --> 01:41:32,854
Hey, he told a nice thing
about girls for the first time.

1739
01:41:33,215 --> 01:41:34,652
What he said is 100 percent correct.

1740
01:41:34,938 --> 01:41:37,383
I feel that there is
no mistake of the girl.

1741
01:41:41,618 --> 01:41:43,386
Well... Why do you seem to be new person?

1742
01:41:44,898 --> 01:41:45,955
New?

1743
01:41:46,842 --> 01:41:47,410
Eh?

1744
01:41:48,334 --> 01:41:50,185
I didn't tell you, right?

1745
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:53,862
The daughter of Professor Murthy...

1746
01:41:54,216 --> 01:41:56,457
-She...
-Daughter of Professor Murthy?

1747
01:41:56,638 --> 01:41:58,483
Yes, it is like...

1748
01:41:58,728 --> 01:42:01,996
Blimey! This chain-guy too fell in love!

1749
01:42:02,121 --> 01:42:04,832
It just happened, dude...

1750
01:42:05,757 --> 01:42:11,070
[laughs]

1751
01:42:12,035 --> 01:42:14,452
Mother, I'm coming home.

1752
01:42:14,945 --> 01:42:16,198
I'm hating this place.

1753
01:42:16,973 --> 01:42:17,933
What happened?

1754
01:42:18,492 --> 01:42:19,215
Nothing.

1755
01:42:19,574 --> 01:42:20,710
I don't want to study anymore.

1756
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:22,845
I'd get married as per father's wish.

1757
01:42:23,323 --> 01:42:25,528
Your father wants you to learn music.

1758
01:42:25,685 --> 01:42:28,030
You need not think about marriage.

1759
01:42:30,385 --> 01:42:32,527
Mother, I have taken the decision.

1760
01:42:32,911 --> 01:42:33,411
See you.

1761
01:42:38,541 --> 01:42:42,192
Violin, will you listen to me please?

1762
01:42:42,743 --> 01:42:44,042
I listen to no one.

1763
01:42:44,768 --> 01:42:45,469
Phew!

1764
01:42:46,011 --> 01:42:47,604
I don't have any right
to change your decision

1765
01:42:47,742 --> 01:42:48,961
but I have the right
to express my opinion.

1766
01:42:52,638 --> 01:42:53,982
Music is your ultimate goal, Violin!

1767
01:42:54,394 --> 01:42:55,446
You have already spent a lot of time for
it,

1768
01:42:55,505 --> 01:42:56,921
fought for it and brought it till here.

1769
01:42:57,121 --> 01:42:58,261
You didn't simply get this chance.

1770
01:42:58,403 --> 01:43:01,150
There is your mother's wish
behind your arrival to here.

1771
01:43:01,358 --> 01:43:04,354
Moreover, you have given hopes that you'd
make your mother's dreams into reality.

1772
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:10,641
Don't cheat yourself out of anger on me.

1773
01:43:12,606 --> 01:43:14,014
I need not want your lecture.

1774
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:25,294
If you want to leave
this place because of me,

1775
01:43:28,196 --> 01:43:28,998
don't go.

1776
01:43:32,046 --> 01:43:32,887
I will go instead.

1777
01:43:38,028 --> 01:43:39,707
I'm not leaving because of you.

1778
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:43,177
I won't give you such a priority.

1779
01:43:43,837 --> 01:43:46,284
Sure. But give priority to yourself.

1780
01:43:46,754 --> 01:43:48,751
Your exams are two days away.
Better attend them and go.

1781
01:43:49,036 --> 01:43:50,247
Just because I have told you,
don't react in the other way.

1782
01:43:50,713 --> 01:43:51,986
Don't miss this chance.

1783
01:43:52,721 --> 01:43:54,044
Think for yourself, not me.

1784
01:43:54,348 --> 01:43:59,132
"Relationships have ended, breath stopped"

1785
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:04,351
"Is there a cure for this?"

1786
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:07,099
"When there is mutual trust,"

1787
01:44:07,231 --> 01:44:09,653
"there won't be any scope for suspicion"

1788
01:44:10,133 --> 01:44:14,905
"If there is sincerity in love"

1789
01:44:15,272 --> 01:44:20,444
"Neither there would be a beginning
nor it would come to an end"

1790
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:25,651
"The heart would be filled
with skyful of love"

1791
01:44:26,047 --> 01:44:31,044
"Let the summer pass...
Let the rainy pass"

1792
01:44:31,333 --> 01:44:36,505
"It's just a formless life"

1793
01:44:36,605 --> 01:44:41,464
"So much that you became my world"

1794
01:44:41,877 --> 01:44:47,277
"I dream of you every moment"

1795
01:44:47,376 --> 01:44:52,242
"You made me a loner now"

1796
01:44:52,614 --> 01:44:58,225
"Yet, I wait for you..."

1797
01:44:58,369 --> 01:44:59,089
Good luck.

1798
01:45:05,582 --> 01:45:07,324
I might not be here when you come back.

1799
01:45:11,058 --> 01:45:12,750
[door creaks and shuts]

1800
01:45:16,548 --> 01:45:21,284
[playing violin]

1801
01:45:25,368 --> 01:45:26,161
Thank you, madam.

1802
01:45:27,793 --> 01:45:28,551
Sireesha

1803
01:45:55,659 --> 01:45:56,319
Meghana.

1804
01:46:05,703 --> 01:46:07,240
First, close your eyes.

1805
01:46:10,257 --> 01:46:11,128
Feel free.

1806
01:46:13,763 --> 01:46:15,023
It's just you in there.

1807
01:46:16,209 --> 01:46:18,242
You know nothing about
the world except the violin.

1808
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:25,239
The entire world contains
only... you and your violin.

1809
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:31,339
[playing violin]

1810
01:47:01,965 --> 01:47:07,372
[applause]

1811
01:47:07,727 --> 01:47:09,247
Heard that you have played very well.

1812
01:47:10,031 --> 01:47:12,009
Ultimately, you have
achieved what you wanted.

1813
01:47:12,488 --> 01:47:13,832
Your friends told me...

1814
01:47:14,488 --> 01:47:17,791
I felt very happy when they said
that everyone was appreciating you.

1815
01:47:18,533 --> 01:47:21,778
Your mother, along with your
father would feel very happy.

1816
01:47:22,832 --> 01:47:24,652
What happened?

1817
01:47:24,976 --> 01:47:26,248
Sir, why are you thinking so much?

1818
01:47:27,452 --> 01:47:28,296
Anything wrong?

1819
01:47:35,406 --> 01:47:38,441
I have been searching for you everywhere.

1820
01:47:38,998 --> 01:47:40,245
I have been to your office as well.

1821
01:47:41,937 --> 01:47:44,028
You aren't answering my phone calls.

1822
01:47:45,079 --> 01:47:46,939
Did you remember me
now after fifteen days?

1823
01:47:47,122 --> 01:47:48,488
What about you? Did you call me either?

1824
01:47:50,158 --> 01:47:52,076
Well, come with me.
What has happened has happened.

1825
01:47:52,512 --> 01:47:53,591
I won't be like that from now.

1826
01:47:57,366 --> 01:47:59,720
Are you sure that we are
suitable for each other?

1827
01:48:00,568 --> 01:48:01,089
Yeah.

1828
01:48:04,325 --> 01:48:06,658
Liking each other isn't love.

1829
01:48:07,716 --> 01:48:09,792
It is about liking
their partner's interest.

1830
01:48:13,236 --> 01:48:15,527
Both of us don't have such kind of liking.

1831
01:48:19,844 --> 01:48:21,817
If we are really made for each other,

1832
01:48:22,552 --> 01:48:24,746
your company should inspire me.

1833
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:27,970
Your word should become my motivation.

1834
01:48:29,077 --> 01:48:30,784
It should fetch me happiness.

1835
01:48:34,761 --> 01:48:38,345
Not only that, but you should also
be by my side even in your absence.

1836
01:49:43,428 --> 01:49:49,351
[footsteps approaching]

1837
01:49:51,149 --> 01:49:51,989
Silencer.

1838
01:49:59,928 --> 01:50:00,905
Silencer.

1839
01:50:06,144 --> 01:50:07,113
Silencer.

1840
01:50:11,878 --> 01:50:13,376
I know you are there.

1841
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:19,063
I have to tell you several things.

1842
01:50:20,729 --> 01:50:25,388
My long awaited dream
became reality because of you.

1843
01:50:29,271 --> 01:50:35,115
I have accepted my parents' will to
pursue the course of my interest but

1844
01:50:40,578 --> 01:50:41,663
not out of consent.

1845
01:50:49,539 --> 01:50:52,652
In your encounter... In your love...

1846
01:50:56,061 --> 01:50:57,846
I lost myself.

1847
01:51:06,564 --> 01:51:08,370
I want you.

1848
01:51:08,997 --> 01:51:10,756
I want your love.

1849
01:51:11,552 --> 01:51:14,076
I want your company forever.

1850
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:18,340
[weeping]

1851
01:51:19,913 --> 01:51:24,850
[loud thud sound]

1852
01:51:28,673 --> 01:51:30,038
[loud thud sound]

1853
01:51:49,396 --> 01:51:55,330
[music]
