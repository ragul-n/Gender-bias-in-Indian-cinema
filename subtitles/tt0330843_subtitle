1
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:08,965
"O beloved, listen to me,
listen to me, my darling"

2
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:18,472
"The moon will stealthily enter
through the window in bare feet"

3
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:26,149
"O beloved, listen to me,
listen to me, my darling"

4
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:35,825
"The moon will stealthily enter
through the window in bare feet"

5
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:54,141
Hey, what are you watching?
Is this a Ramlila?

6
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:00,109
Hey, you. Stop. - Sir, I've got to
go to the station.

7
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,654
Do I have to write it down for you?
Can't you hear?

8
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,822
Sorry sir, Sorry.
- You can't go from here.

9
00:02:04,823 --> 00:02:09,419
There has been an accident.
Take a U-turn and go back. Go...

10
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:23,467
Today 6.30 p. M Marine Lines Station

11
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,440
What are you doing here?
Waiting for Suhani?

12
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,574
Like always.

13
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:32,311
If you'd married me, you wouldn't
have had to do all this.

14
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,745
If she doesn't come in the
next ten minutes...

15
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,782
We'll run away to a temple
and get married.

16
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:41,614
Let's go.

17
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:10,473
Is Suhani there?

18
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,644
Did she say where she was going?

19
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:23,584
Are you sure she is not somewhere
there... in the hospital?

20
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:28,927
Okay, I'll disconnect
the phone.

21
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:22,112
2 years before in Naangav

22
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:54,245
"It overflowed... the water from
the pitcher overflowed"

23
00:05:55,088 --> 00:06:01,357
"It overflowed, for the
eye could not hold"

24
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:19,600
"Mother said, don't go.
Brother, I didn't listen to him"

25
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:25,273
"Father said, just one day more.
And it overflowed"

26
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,185
"Gudda said don't go.
Guddi too said the same"

27
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,827
"Friend said, just one day more.
And it overflowed..."

28
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:43,302
"The water from the
pitcher overflowed"

29
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:50,800
"It overflowed, for the eyes
couldn't hold"

30
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,197
There goes one more.
Another one bites the dust.

31
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,674
He used to be quite a happy guy.

32
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,075
Now he's gone and stuck his
head in a noose.

33
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,512
Why? What's wrong with our girl?
- Your girl?

34
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,215
So big? How old are you?

35
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:34,386
It's the magic of LUX beauty soap!
What else?

36
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,923
Are you done speaking?
- Yes.

37
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:41,225
What was it you were saying about
putting his head in a noose?

38
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:42,393
When it comes to
wearing the garland...

39
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:45,396
Why'd you all stick your heads
out like tortoises?

40
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,889
It's just that this tortoise did not
know that you live in this village.

41
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,236
I am very pleased to meet you.
What's your name?

42
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:53,171
Ruin.

43
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:56,140
What's the matter Adi?
- I thought marriage was ruin.

44
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:58,042
Ok. So what if it's not you.

45
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:02,047
There are other men who will
willingly die for me.

46
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,282
Hey, you mirchi (chili)

47
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,918
Here's a bitter gourd.
Eat it. You and your disciples.

48
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,653
Adi, what's she saying
& going away?

49
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:13,458
Don't put your lips to it.
She's quite bitter.

50
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:19,557
"As she walked, she said
your house was small"

51
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,508
"I left my songs behind.
Under the wings of a bird"

52
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,743
By the way, who is this girl who
just gave this shagun?

53
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,210
Why? Do you also want the shagun?
- No... no.

54
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:36,544
She talks a lot.
Quite a wily girl.

55
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,282
Listen Mister,
she's my daughter.

56
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:39,950
Daughter!

57
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:42,521
No, I meant she is very gifted.

58
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,590
Faux paus... I'm dead meat.

59
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,792
By the way... what is her name?

60
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,062
Boy, if you weren't a guest I would
have made mincemeat out of you.

61
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,129
Get lost... mannerless.

62
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,932
"And the water from the
pitcher overflowed"

63
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,003
"It overflowed, for the eyes
couldn't hold"

64
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,370
"Mother said don't go.
Brother said I didn't listen"

65
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:15,043
"Father said just one day more.
And the water overflowed"

66
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,890
"The crow said don't go.
So did the saint..."

67
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:26,961
"The crow said, just one day more.
And it overflowed"

68
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,576
Oh Ruin, I was looking for you.

69
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,644
Even my father is looking for you.
- Oh God... Escape!

70
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,855
You have a great smile.

71
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:55,451
I had heard that village girls are
very simple and innocent.

72
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,427
Shy!

73
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,761
Excuse me aunty! Here, she is both
simple and shy.

74
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,567
Great son! - Greetings.

75
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:10,634
"Father... I left your courtyard"

76
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:31,553
"Your courtyard...
I left it behind"

77
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:38,364
"When I come home next time,
bring a diamond ring"

78
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:51,206
"My friends will play with it
on their laps..."

79
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:55,052
"A bouncing bonny baby"

80
00:10:55,053 --> 00:11:05,395
"When the monsoons come this time"

81
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:08,725
"Another kind of separation
will have its say..."

82
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:14,493
"Separation from my beloved"

83
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,703
RAILWAY COLONY, MUMBAI.

84
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,345
Close the book and
open your mouth and eat.

85
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,447
This way nothing will go in either
your mouth or your brain.

86
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:58,983
Oh mom, if I fail, you'll haul me
over burning coals.

87
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,152
No. I'll eat you raw.

88
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,821
The things your father has to
endure for your studies.

89
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:07,357
Please quit fighting.
- What else should I do?

90
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,494
Now, why are you not eating?

91
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,162
The paratha is so oily and
the yogurt is so sour.

92
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:14,331
Then, how come Dina ate it?

93
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,835
Oh God! Dina! Dina! Dina!

94
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,772
She's the only one you like.
The rest are all second rate.

95
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,005
Now, will you two stop it?

96
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:24,341
Mom, she has an exam today.

97
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:27,846
What should I do with this girl?

98
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,379
Hey, where're you going?

99
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,349
You carry your anger on the
tip of your tongue.

100
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,649
Once you become a doctor,
your patients will die without a hiccup.

101
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,856
If something happens to me,
don't ever take me to her.

102
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:40,358
This girl is a real burden.

103
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,859
So why don't you give me
away to him?

104
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,027
To whom?

105
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:48,133
He who believes that a girl
is a burden.

106
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:52,498
Do your exam well.

107
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,373
Dad! Good I met you.
Now my paper will go off well.

108
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,374
Your blessings are very important
for doing well.

109
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,710
Go via the temple.
Here, keep some money.

110
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:04,678
Dad, she sends others to the
temple for her.

111
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,679
You are so pretty.
One kiss on this cheek.

112
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,888
Your beard is hurting.

113
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,724
My beard hurts... let it.

114
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:18,229
Some things also hurt me...
Hurt me a lot.

115
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,167
Hi uncle. - Hi Pinks.

116
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,835
And rub yourself clean.

117
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,738
The smoke must have
clogged your pores.

118
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,866
Do you know what your son did yesterday?
- Why, is he not your son?

119
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:34,205
I saw him on a motorcycle...
with a long haired woman.

120
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,080
Both of them were in flames.

121
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,415
Even smoke was coming out
of their mouths.

122
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,543
Dad! Why are you beating about the bush?
Get to the point.

123
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,088
Mom, Dad saw me smoking a
cigarette yesterday.

124
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,758
Cigarette!
They were smoking a cigar.

125
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,093
A Peace pipe. He would take a drag
and pass it to her...

126
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,129
She would take a drag
and pass it back.

127
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,998
What a good for nothing. Son, I've.

128
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,268
Who was she? - Like a brother.

129
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,769
Adding glitter to the Gold.

130
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,672
She is just like a boy.

131
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,273
She must have been Meera, mom.

132
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:06,711
Even you scolded her for
talking like boys.

133
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,980
And if I smoked one cigarette,
what great sin have I committed?

134
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:14,914
You have done a great deed.

135
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:33,363
"It overflowed... the water from
the pitcher overflowed".

136
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:40,740
"It overflowed for the
eye couldn't hold".

137
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,831
You don't know anything about her...

138
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:04,826
And you want us to find one girl
in a population of 12 million.

139
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,033
What's the population of Bombay?
- 12 million.

140
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,843
How many of them will be women?
- 50%

141
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,945
6 million approximately.

142
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,547
Out of these 6 million, how many
would be college going?

143
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,917
Hardly 10%
- No no, less than that.

144
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,451
Let's assume 10% So how many is that?
- 600,000.

145
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:24,154
Out of these 600,000, how many
would be medical students?

146
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:27,591
So, she is a doctor. Lets say 1%

147
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,293
How many? How many?

148
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:33,095
600, no no no. 6000.
- Your maths is very weak.

149
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,532
Out of this 6000, how many
would travel in a local train?

150
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,200
Only in the city of Bombay?

151
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:38,835
Most would travel by car.

152
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:43,967
Leaving out buses, taxis and autos,
at least 1% will use local trains.

153
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,744
So, how many does that leave us with?
- Barely 60.

154
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,147
So, out of 60 medical students.

155
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:55,048
Is it so difficult... to search for
1 medical student?

156
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:58,889
Come quickly.

157
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,758
"Life is a pleasant journey"

158
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,827
She is looking at you.

159
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:07,059
"What happens tomorrow,
no one knows..."

160
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:22,643
"Sing and dance through your life...
don't bother what the world has to say"

161
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:28,543
Don't bother. Correct.

162
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:36,727
I think you are in love.

163
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,788
There is no such perversity in my mind.
- What do you mean?

164
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:43,301
I mean I have not lost my bearings.

165
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,238
All that is for the unoccupied.

166
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:51,004
Mister, this is not love.
This is lust.

167
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:54,403
It's also called desire or hunger.

168
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:56,513
Now repeat what I said.

169
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:59,050
Shut up Mr. Psychic.

170
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,086
Look son, after seeing this girl's body
once... you've lost your balance.

171
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:03,620
After seeing her gait... you've
forgotten where you are going,

172
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:06,990
Do you call this love?

173
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,626
So what do we call it?
- As a famous poet once said:

174
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:15,066
"What we call love is nothing
but a perversity of the mind"

175
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,067
What do you mean perversity?

176
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,870
In medical terms...

177
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,338
It means that your hormones
are working overtime.

178
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,739
Shut up.

179
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,938
In Hindi, that means keep your
nonsense to yourself.

180
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:32,616
Your face is saying it all.
- What?

181
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:35,252
That I've lost my bearing!?

182
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:40,157
It looks like there is a fire in you.
- Shut up.

183
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,960
"This life is a pleasant journey..."

184
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:48,155
Shut up Dina, let me sleep.

185
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,746
He's not here.
Get off the train.

186
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,781
Why don't you look on top.
Maybe he's dancing on the roof.

187
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:06,150
Very funny!

188
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,352
By the time you see him,
the train would have started.

189
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:13,718
Look there. Over there...
your lover boy.

190
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,429
Aren't you going to get off?

191
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,204
Hello!

192
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:05,276
Hi!

193
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:09,212
Who are you looking for?
- Nobody.

194
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,549
That girl there?
Whose taking off her...

195
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,519
Taking the clothes off the line?

196
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,489
Do you know her name?

197
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,893
Do you know how to whistle?
...Like this? Good.

198
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,863
You look like a decent man.
Make some noise...

199
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:30,990
What? - Accelerate your bike.

200
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,537
Dina

201
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,839
See. It worked.

202
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,441
What are you doing there?

203
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,178
Coming, I was just showing
him the way.

204
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,379
Poor thing, didn't know where to go.

205
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,107
Dina, are you coming up or not?

206
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,629
This life is a pleasant journey.

207
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,264
Where? - Who?

208
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,531
Why are you singing this song now?

209
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:04,695
Life is a pleasant journey.

210
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,640
Miss. Suhani, I miss you very much.

211
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:13,044
Morning, noon and night...
your face haunts me.

212
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:19,217
Either stop haunting me or tell me
what we both should do.

213
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,919
Miss. Suhani, I miss you very much.

214
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,652
Morning, noon and night...
your face haunts me.

215
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:28,280
Shut up Dina. He's mad.

216
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:47,008
He's even landed here.
- He's the same chap, isn't he?

217
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:50,047
Yes. The madman has come here also.
Excuse me.

218
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,249
Yes, I'll give her moral support.

219
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,616
Where are you going?
- Body Guard.

220
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:57,642
No, you come here. Come with me.

221
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:02,253
What's your name?

222
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,296
Aditya.

223
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,964
Are you after girls leaving
your studies behind?

224
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:10,166
Looks like your father has a
lot of money to waste.

225
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:12,435
Yeah. That's just,
what he says too.

226
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:15,038
How many times have you failed
in your class?

227
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,772
I haven't so far. But may be this time
it'll happen.

228
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,887
"Dear friend..."

229
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:36,623
"Your soft, lilting laughter"

230
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:47,132
"I heard it and drank it all up"

231
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:14,828
"May you always laugh like this,
and blush shyly"

232
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,103
"And light and darkness meet on the
nape of your neck, under your curls..."

233
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:25,501
"May your fragrant laughter grow
and envelop me..."

234
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:51,532
"Don't go in the garden dressed
in yellow sunshine"

235
00:22:51,970 --> 00:23:00,638
"The bees will tease you,
so don't go among the flowers"

236
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:12,583
"Laugh softly again...
your beautiful laughter..."

237
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:17,692
"Lying on the lawn,
like freshly fallen leaves"

238
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:22,964
"There are seven hues in one sensuous
move of Spring"

239
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,703
"The rainy season... it's all you"

240
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:37,875
"Laugh season to season...
that soft laughter of yours"

241
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:42,752
"Dear friend..."

242
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:50,589
"Your soft lilting laugh"

243
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,760
"I heard it, and drank it all up"

244
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:10,036
"Come, let's roam around
in the blue skies sometime..."

245
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:20,288
"If we find a speck of cloud by chance,
let's shower it on earth"

246
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:31,232
"Your ear-ring is quivering...
somewhere morning has broken"

247
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:36,634
"Somewhere evening has fallen"

248
00:24:57,695 --> 00:25:07,332
"In the shelter of your hair,
we will spend the night"

249
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:17,842
"Your jet-black eyes
hold a glint in them"

250
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:28,957
"In exchange for a smile from you
take this earth of mine..."

251
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,698
"And this sky too"

252
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:38,028
"Oh dear friend..."

253
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:48,368
"Your soft, lilting laughter...
dear, dear friend..."

254
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,209
"I heard it, and drank it all up"

255
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,457
"Snow has fallen in the valley..."

256
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:05,729
"Cuddled in white woolen"

257
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,962
"Snow has fallen in the valley,
and your laughter hummed through it"

258
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,504
"Cuddled in wool..."

259
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,239
"Talk and words come out as vapor"

260
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,144
"Hot, steaming vapor...
yet soft and gentle"

261
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:40,631
Who's speaking?

262
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,732
Tell him: Call Suhani
from no. 105

263
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:45,335
Call Suhani from No. 105.

264
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:47,805
Who's that? - This is Pinky.

265
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,774
Pinky? - He asks Pinky, who?

266
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,343
Tell him her friend's sister.

267
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,278
Tell him her friend's sister.

268
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,779
What work do you have with her?

269
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,981
Uncle wants to talk to her.

270
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:02,113
Brat. Say what I say.
- Brat, say what I say.

271
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,557
You shouldn't talk like that.

272
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:10,059
Say, go and tell Suhani...
that there is a call for her.

273
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,363
Why are you abusing the kid?

274
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,364
I am not abusing her, madam.
He is my nephew.

275
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:15,031
Give me the phone.

276
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:18,335
Uncle, my ten rupees.
You promised me.

277
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,703
Here. Now, run away.

278
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,038
Hi Jeevan Uncle, whose phone is it?
- It's some friend's, uncle.

279
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:29,846
Suhani? - You! Where did you get
my number from?

280
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:32,583
Listen, I have something to tell you.
- What?

281
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,983
Tomorrow there is a function
at our house.

282
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,952
Be here sharp at 9 am.

283
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:37,554
Me? Why me?

284
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,684
Why? Because you sing very well.
- So what?

285
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,921
Look, I am not asking you to come
with me to Khandala, am I?

286
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,500
I'm only asking you to come
for our family function.

287
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,002
But, why should I come
to your house?

288
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:55,806
Because if you don't come
to my house,

289
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,641
I will bring everyone
to your house.

290
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,411
You are mad.
You've totally lost it.

291
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,746
I am mad for you.

292
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,581
At least write down the address
of my mad house.

293
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,651
63, Silverine. - Listen.

294
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,685
At least listen to me.

295
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,387
OK, do you know Worli dairy?
Take a 'u-turn' from there...

296
00:28:11,388 --> 00:28:15,189
Close to it is a garden,
our house is just next to that.

297
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:33,871
Adi? Who's this Adi in our house?

298
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:44,882
"Looking into my eyes..."
"meeting my gaze..."

299
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:54,863
"Looking into my eyes, betrayal and
deceit he gave me..."

300
00:28:55,066 --> 00:29:00,799
"He held me captive
in his eyes"

301
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:22,056
"I lost all sense of myself.
I was in a trance..."

302
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:47,115
"He sure had cast a spell on me..."
"with a mere touch"

303
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:54,119
"Deceit and betrayal is what I saw him
overflowing with..."

304
00:29:54,358 --> 00:30:03,825
"When he looked into my eyes..."
"when he looked into my eyes"

305
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:10,303
"He held me captive in his eyes"

306
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:13,977
Who are those girls?

307
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,145
She's the one I am going to marry.

308
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:17,014
Which one?

309
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,784
That one in the cream sari.

310
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,820
Adi, are you really going to
marry that girl?

311
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:26,522
Absolutely aunty. So far
we haven't fixed a date...

312
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:28,925
But, once it's fixed.
You will be the first to know.

313
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:33,196
Adi's marriage has been finalized.

314
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,532
Adi's engagement has been fixed.
She's Adi's fiancée.

315
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,803
Congratulations. - Congratulations.

316
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:43,539
You didn't tell us Aditya's marriage
has been fixed.

317
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,375
Who's, what has been fixed?
- Adi's... Marriage.

318
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:50,881
Really. With whom?
- With that girl.

319
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,150
The one in the cream sari.

320
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,719
Congratulations to you also.

321
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,055
She won't ask for any dowry,
I hope...

322
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,891
You are very amusing.

323
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:01,557
Yes.

324
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,162
Who's that?

325
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,130
I don't know.
- What do you mean?

326
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,165
Why did you say that
I am going to marry you?

327
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:12,134
When did I say that
you are marrying me?

328
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:18,036
I only said that
I am marrying you.

329
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,611
Did you ask me?

330
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,479
How can I? That is the work
of the elders in a family.

331
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,711
But if you are insisting, why don't I
ask you? Will you...? - Very Good.

332
00:31:28,318 --> 00:31:30,053
Then tomorrow morning, I'll send mom
and dad over to your place...

333
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,954
Everything can be finalized there.

334
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:33,589
Why would I want to marry you?

335
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,425
No no no. You should ask,
why would I want to marry you?

336
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:40,551
Why?

337
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,266
Because...

338
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,934
What?

339
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:49,060
Should I...?

340
00:31:56,513 --> 00:31:58,749
What is that?

341
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,079
What do you mean? - Yes

342
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,290
What do you mean...
- What do you mean...?

343
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:11,060
I love you... it means
I can do anything for you.

344
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:13,462
Can you jump from the
train for me?

345
00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:15,999
Sure. As soon as it stops,
I'll jump off.

346
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,023
And as soon as you jump,
I'll marry.

347
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:31,882
It's simple.
Do you like him or not?

348
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,917
My final exams are approaching,
and then I have to intern.

349
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,988
And I have to prepare for my M.D.,
as well. I don't know.

350
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,723
But answer me.
Do you like him or not?

351
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:44,957
How can I? Before me, you have to
get married... we'll see after that.

352
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:49,566
Give me a straight, yes or no.
- No.

353
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:53,025
Alright, then, My way is clear.
Don't blame me later.

354
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:54,438
What do you mean?

355
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,573
Meaning, you don't like him
but I like him a lot.

356
00:32:56,574 --> 00:33:01,211
What do you mean by that?
- Simple. L-like-him-a-lot.

357
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:07,407
So, you want to have your cake
and eat it too.

358
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:13,353
Dad, if there is a proposal from a
rich family, what would you do?

359
00:33:13,924 --> 00:33:17,059
What?
- What are you muttering?

360
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,596
I am just asking.
If there is a proposal then...

361
00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:24,101
What sort of a proposal?
- Obviously a marriage proposal.

362
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,502
Now, someone isn't gong to come
and get a rakhi tied from you.

363
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:28,704
If she is saying something,
let her finish it.

364
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:31,508
Dina, stop throwing the trump card.

365
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:36,712
I got a jack,
so I am throwing a jack.

366
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:40,384
Excuse me. I have to study.

367
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:42,385
It's your turn. - Yes.

368
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:45,913
A family is going to come with
a marriage proposal...

369
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,594
Not for me, for Suhani.
- All right, but who is it?

370
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:55,865
A barrister... his son is Aditya.

371
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:59,325
No one has sent any word.
They won't just land up just like that?

372
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,306
That's what I am doing.
Informing you.

373
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:06,843
Is this why we pawned our jewellery
and sent you to college?

374
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,212
Did we sent you to
college for this?

375
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,846
Mom, I haven't done anything.

376
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:13,183
Neither am I marrying... nor have I asked
anyone to come with a proposal.

377
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,118
If someone wants to pile on,
what can I do?

378
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,520
You must have done something.

379
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:22,353
Otherwise no one piles on
just like that.

380
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:50,152
Please, come in.

381
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:52,455
Barrister Om Sehgal.
Your bell is probably not working.

382
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:54,457
That's why, I had to use my hands.

383
00:34:54,458 --> 00:35:00,052
I did call the electrician,
but he hasn't shown up.

384
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:04,967
How do you do?
- How do you do?

385
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:08,838
Please, come this way...

386
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,306
I hope you didn't have a problem
finding the house?

387
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:13,976
It was a bit of problem.
All these houses look so alike...

388
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,480
Like compartments of a train.
After all, it is a railway colony.

389
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,781
He loves to joke.

390
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:20,817
All middle class houses
look alike.

391
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:24,275
Maybe you have never seen them...
Come Suhani.

392
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,922
Sir, these are my daughters.
Dina and Suhani. Come in... Sit.

393
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,893
Both of them sing very beautifully.
I've heard them when they came home.

394
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:41,037
Really?

395
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:44,440
They've been brewing
their own broth quietly.

396
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,810
Times and customs are changing.

397
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,514
Parents today are just figureheads...
to endorse the wishes of their children.

398
00:35:50,514 --> 00:35:52,948
These children do as they please, we no
longer have a say in anything.

399
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:55,718
Now, I told Aditya that I agree
that it's my money...

400
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:59,713
But the lungs are yours,
but where will he quit smoking?

401
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,894
By the way, between these two
which one is the one Aditya wants...

402
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,863
He is very forgetful by nature.

403
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,698
If I happen to overstay...
at my parent's house.

404
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,134
He'll ask me at the door
"Who are you?"

405
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,303
"Whom do you wish to see?"

406
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,538
Quite an entertaining man.

407
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,543
He must keep everyone
occupied at home.

408
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:22,878
Why don't you get some tea
for everyone?

409
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,413
Suhani is the younger one.

410
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:26,750
She and Adi are in love
with each other.

411
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,777
And the elder?
- Dina is the elder one.

412
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:32,421
She isn't married yet.
- Why?

413
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:36,025
Is she waiting for someone
who won't ask for dowry?

414
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,395
You are quite rude,

415
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,529
Sir, What do you think
my daughters are?

416
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,864
We might be poor, but we've brought
them up like princesses.

417
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:47,771
Please don't misunderstand me.
I was saying it's good...

418
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:51,036
That the girl's parents don't have to
worry about dowry now.

419
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,536
Anyway we don't expect anything...
from you.

420
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,946
No, if you have any expectations,
do tell us.

421
00:36:56,947 --> 00:36:58,348
What expectations
can we have from you?

422
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,348
We don't have any from
our own son.

423
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:00,917
We've given him good education...
that's enough.

424
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,151
He's an adult now.

425
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:03,919
If he even picks up someone
from the street...

426
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,754
We cannot do anything about it.

427
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,388
One minute.

428
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:09,722
Do you think we are auctioning
our daughters on the roadside...

429
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,493
For the first available groom?

430
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:14,129
Dad, what are you saying?
- You keep quiet.

431
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,466
Mr. Advocate here can argue with
a magistrate...

432
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,234
But he does not know the courtesies
to talk to his in-laws to be.

433
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,604
You are unnecessarily
twisting the issue.

434
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,041
I did not mean that at all.
- There is nothing more to be said.

435
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,710
We do not want to marry our daughter
in your family.

436
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:30,847
What has happened hasn't happened with
either your consent or mine.

437
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:34,248
Let it be, this is no time
for sweets, let's go.

438
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:40,282
I'm glad we're under
no obligations.

439
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,335
Suhani... Listen...
What happened?

440
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:57,932
What had to happen has happened.
Let's finish this right here.

441
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,343
Dad went to meet your father.
What happened?

442
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:03,579
Yes, they met.
Like Musharraf met Vajpayee.

443
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,811
It was like reliving the Agra summit.
- This marriage is not between...

444
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,252
A Prime Minister and a President for the
decision to be taken in Parliament.

445
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,187
We have to marry.
It's for us to decide.

446
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,589
What will we decide?

447
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:16,058
By seeking their permission...
we showed them our respect.

448
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:18,495
The respect we got... from your
father is more than enough.

449
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,596
We don't want anymore.

450
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,564
So, my love for you comes
to nothing?

451
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,366
How long have you known me?
20 weeks?

452
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,569
They have nurtured me for 20 years.

453
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,971
I cannot leave them for you.

454
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:33,175
Suhani, I can leave everything
for you. Everything.

455
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,377
Today, you can leave
everything for me...

456
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:38,748
What is the guarantee that tomorrow you
will not leave me for another girl?

457
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:39,582
What is this inverted logic?

458
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,252
In the end... why do I have to
be the scapegoat?

459
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,354
Why are you making a mountain...
out of a molehill?

460
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,689
You saw me, chased me,
professed your love...

461
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,925
That's all. What if I had refused you
right in the beginning?

462
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,428
Then, I would have called it
your bad luck.

463
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:55,097
So, do that now.

464
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,933
Ok... ok... you were right
and I was wrong.

465
00:38:56,934 --> 00:39:00,170
At least listen to me, Suhani.
Please. Just one minute.

466
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:05,268
See, what is the hurry to decide?
Give it some time.

467
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,610
10 days... Only one week...
till the 15th.

468
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,013
Think about it.
If you still think that...

469
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:15,617
How will one week change anything?
Just leave it.

470
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,282
Give it some time.
Anything can happen. Please.

471
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,460
I might fall in love
with someone else.

472
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:28,929
You love me, don't you?

473
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:39,704
Today 9.50 p. M Marine Lines Station

474
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,823
Going fine, sir.

475
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:58,625
How is Dr. Suhani?
We never get time to talk to her.

476
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,331
Before it's 5.30, she has already
left the hospital.

477
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,667
Is it?

478
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,836
This evening, I told her to wait for me.
I had some work.

479
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,907
I got delayed by 10 minutes and
she was nowhere to be found.

480
00:40:10,907 --> 00:40:13,009
Sir, I'll talk to you later.

481
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:16,945
What happened? - He doesn't know.

482
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:20,416
She left the hospital at 5.30.

483
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:26,909
Call Rajee. She must have gone there.
She's just had a baby.

484
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,996
Hi Adi... long time no see.
You and Suhani don't come over often?

485
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,864
In a day or two.

486
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:38,960
And listen... - Ok, bye.

487
00:40:56,653 --> 00:40:59,555
Aditya, this relationship
is not possible.

488
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:02,724
Lives don't change in 8 or 10 days.

489
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,028
And I heard that lives
change in a flash.

490
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,932
Mine didn't.

491
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,334
You didn't miss me at all?

492
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:16,371
No, there was no reason to.

493
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:20,139
And there is so much to do.
Household chores. Studies.

494
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:30,510
You want to think again?
- I've thought already.

495
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,930
Always stay like this.

496
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,600
How? Weeping?

497
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:47,726
Laughing.

498
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:18,735
How long will you evade it?

499
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:21,471
...I mean, the train?
How long will you avoid train?

500
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:27,371
I might even forget,
only if you let me.

501
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:49,523
Take it easy. It's a computer...
not your grandfather's typewriter.

502
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,094
Like Billu, even we'll have our days...
- Who's Billu?

503
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:59,130
Good old Bill Gates, who else?

504
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,056
You should come quickly to take
your calls, especially at night.

505
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:17,693
Uncle, your phone.

506
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:22,525
What are you doing?

507
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:41,639
What's the matter?
Has it got disconnected?

508
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,650
Then, why don't you talk?
I am not listening.

509
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:10,137
Who are you looking for?
- Do you know where Suhani is?

510
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:14,449
Hadn't you both broken up?

511
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,852
Broken up... yet...
Do you know where she is?

512
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:20,422
I've been looking for her for many days.
- She's gone.

513
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:23,259
Gone? - She's gone to the US.

514
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:29,523
US? - No, she has gone on
a Medical camp.

515
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:33,970
When is she returning?
- In 3 weeks.

516
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,404
3 weeks?

517
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:40,304
Three weeks is too long, isn't it?

518
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,830
What will you do with 2,000 rupees?

519
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:03,165
I am going out.

520
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,801
Where? Outside Bombay?

521
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:09,137
Yes... I'll be back soon.

522
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,006
What if your father finds out...?

523
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:13,975
Please handle him.

524
00:45:13,976 --> 00:45:17,547
Are you going with Suhani?

525
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:21,650
To find her.

526
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:25,110
"The sky was barren"

527
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,495
"When I went in search of you,
my dear beloved"

528
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:38,297
"I walked many miserable miles.

529
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:41,630
"It's all such a waste"
"It's all a wasteland, so futile..."

530
00:45:52,449 --> 00:46:01,322
"Let me meet my darling...
Let me meet, just once"

531
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:15,138
"O my dearest one,
I scanned the skies minutely..."

532
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:20,007
"and plucked the broken stars"

533
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:26,478
"This starlight till the dawn,
my eyes get no sleep"

534
00:46:51,974 --> 00:46:54,743
"Just to hear your footfall..."

535
00:46:54,744 --> 00:47:00,047
"I have even borne the silence of
the stones and the statues"

536
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:05,782
"I now find only dejection"

537
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:39,072
"Look at the fate that is
etched on my brow"

538
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:46,313
"Whenever I saw footprints,
I've bowed my head there"

539
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,035
"How many times must
I call out to you?"

540
00:49:00,036 --> 00:49:04,996
"Your name is what
I find everywhere"

541
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:34,569
Why did you take so long to come?

542
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:38,336
I can't live without you...
not a single day.

543
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:43,003
Not a moment.

544
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:49,017
Can you do anything for me?

545
00:49:49,018 --> 00:49:53,644
Should I jump off a moving train?

546
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:58,052
Marry me.

547
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:02,564
We'll marry and stay
in our own homes.

548
00:50:02,565 --> 00:50:05,201
We won't tell anyone yet.

549
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,736
Not a soul? - No.

550
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:11,568
When the time is right,
we'll disclose it.

551
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:28,156
What happened?
What are you thinking?

552
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:29,457
I am very scared.

553
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:32,561
Never mind. Then, get married
in a state of scare.

554
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:35,397
Don't be silly.
I am really scared.

555
00:50:35,398 --> 00:50:38,134
I'll give you one slap
and it will be alright.

556
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:41,137
I warned you 10 times.
Think before you say yes.

557
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:45,673
And every time you told me
to shut up.

558
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:50,179
I'm in a dilemma.

559
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:53,349
I've thought about this
very seriously.

560
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:56,252
If I felt it was wrong I would
never let you do it.

561
00:50:56,253 --> 00:51:02,585
Now come on or you'll miss the bus.
Come on.

562
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,062
How come you're wearing
a sari today?

563
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,263
Isn't she looking pretty?

564
00:51:08,264 --> 00:51:09,964
Of course.

565
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:13,628
But she suddenly looks like, it's time
for her to get married.

566
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:15,604
Why don't I get her married, then?

567
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:16,671
Let's hurry up.

568
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:21,764
We're sure to miss the bus...
We'll go by an auto.

569
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:27,015
Where are my princesses going
dressed like this?

570
00:51:27,016 --> 00:51:30,646
We are getting late.
- I am glad I met you...

571
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:34,789
God bless you.

572
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:39,121
I'm late today.

573
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:40,462
Adi... which way are you going?

574
00:51:40,463 --> 00:51:42,363
Why don't you carry on...?

575
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:44,533
Aren't you very late today?

576
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,000
Yes, we were discussing
the Gazdar case.

577
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:47,502
Where are you going in
such a hurry?

578
00:51:47,503 --> 00:51:49,738
Close by... to meet a friend.

579
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,874
Get in, I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK.

580
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:56,945
Get in, you'll waste money on
a taxi otherwise. Sit down.

581
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,382
You haven't informed their
parents, have you?

582
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:03,151
No, just a few college friends.

583
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:06,679
Very good. I am tired of marrying
couples in the court.

584
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,991
We're crossing the court,
let's cross it fast.

585
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:12,094
And Mr. Aditya,
what's cooking nowadays?

586
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:14,129
Nothing at all, dad.

587
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,732
I am aware of everything
that is happening.

588
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,234
What?

589
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:19,567
You haven't completed
your law studies,

590
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:20,569
And you've started a
computer business.

591
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,071
Oh, that! - What oh...?

592
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,638
Where will you get the capital from?

593
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:26,871
The Bank is ready to give a loan.
- Really?

594
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:32,880
Only, if you sign the guarantee...
- Of course. It's your right.

595
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,084
We have a debt to repay to you.
Isn't it our duty?

596
00:52:36,085 --> 00:52:40,052
Where is the groom?

597
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:45,489
This is going to be interesting.

598
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:48,531
Aditya, what are you doing
in a temple?

599
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:52,764
So, this is a temple?
- You don't believe in God.

600
00:52:53,135 --> 00:52:56,536
So, what are you doing here?
You must have a reason.

601
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,741
What can I do, aunty? You have to
come here to get married.

602
00:52:59,742 --> 00:53:03,474
Oh shut up! Anyway, God will
do his justice.

603
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:10,177
Does he do his justice
in English or in Hindi?

604
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:32,641
"O beloved..."

605
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:37,443
"Listen, my darling.
Listen my dearest"

606
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:44,108
"The moon will stealthily enter
through the window, barefoot"

607
00:53:44,853 --> 00:53:59,132
"Listen, my beloved.
Listen my love"

608
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:08,572
Now, the fun starts.

609
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:09,336
My wife has gone and all I am left with
is a receipt for our marriage.

610
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:15,311
Have patience for a few days.

611
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:19,771
How many days? ...4... 5... 6...?

612
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:24,478
First, let Dina get married at least.
- Then, ask her to get married.

613
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,757
Why don't we get her married
next week itself?

614
00:55:28,757 --> 00:55:30,959
First, let me finish my internship
and in the meanwhile...

615
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,690
You must establish your business.
- You are being so cold.

616
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,563
Do you know today is
our nuptial night?

617
00:55:40,393 --> 00:55:43,661
Can we meet somewhere?

618
00:55:43,663 --> 00:55:46,064
Right now, I am at
Jeevan uncle's stores...

619
00:55:46,065 --> 00:55:51,524
Asking the rates for food grains.
- You are so unromantic. So unromantic!

620
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,875
What good night?

621
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:06,174
All alone...
It's a lonely night.

622
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,694
Remove your hand.
People are watching. - So what?

623
00:56:17,695 --> 00:56:20,832
You are my legal wife.
Here's the certificate.

624
00:56:20,832 --> 00:56:24,701
Why are you carrying this around?
- What can I do?

625
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:29,841
This is the only substitute I have.

626
00:56:29,841 --> 00:56:31,475
Why are you going on and on with wife?
Wife...? Take off your hand.

627
00:56:31,476 --> 00:56:36,540
Is she your wife?
- No, she is my life.

628
00:56:37,315 --> 00:56:42,752
Sit properly.
This is a public bus.

629
00:56:42,752 --> 00:56:46,884
Are you married?
- Yes, since 15 years.

630
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:50,328
I pity your husband.

631
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:54,625
Nothing...d

632
00:56:55,967 --> 00:57:02,130
Suhani, there is a call for you.

633
00:57:15,353 --> 00:57:16,019
What is it?

634
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,154
I told you I love you.
- I know.

635
00:57:19,157 --> 00:57:21,858
Then, you should also know that
we both have the same address.

636
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:27,527
Yet, we are both so far.
Tell me, you love me.

637
00:57:29,467 --> 00:57:31,537
Tell the doctor to check
his patients.

638
00:57:31,538 --> 00:57:35,371
I say, hang up...
Sir, it's an emergency case.

639
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:38,376
We'll have to keep him
in intensive care.

640
00:57:38,377 --> 00:57:42,934
He sounds a little mad.

641
00:57:43,949 --> 00:57:50,109
She didn't say it? - Run.

642
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:09,371
Sorry. You had to wait for 2 hours.

643
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:13,945
To catch a glimpse of you,
I can wait for two lifetimes.

644
00:58:13,946 --> 00:58:16,547
I've got to go. - No.

645
00:58:16,548 --> 00:58:22,346
People are coming to see Dina.
- No.

646
00:58:42,406 --> 00:58:46,239
"Come everyday to me
turn the night into a day"

647
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:51,179
"On the sly, under the
sheet of the night"

648
00:58:51,382 --> 00:58:55,340
"Where even the moon can't approach"

649
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:59,019
"Let's go behind a cloud"

650
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:06,922
"Where every drop pines...
every drop is in turmoil"

651
00:59:08,264 --> 00:59:13,465
"Where time stops still"

652
00:59:13,603 --> 00:59:18,097
"Give us a hug under the
sheet of the night"

653
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:50,138
"In the warmth of the
winter's sunshine"

654
00:59:51,108 --> 00:59:54,509
"Look at me with lowered eyes..."

655
00:59:55,681 --> 00:59:59,639
"from behind your hand"

656
01:00:00,118 --> 01:00:13,019
"Blow hot and cold. Ever so softly
in the raag Marva"

657
01:00:13,464 --> 01:00:17,527
"Let not the day set.
Nor the night fall"

658
01:00:17,836 --> 01:00:22,034
"Let not the sun set"

659
01:00:22,473 --> 01:00:26,069
"And if it does, let not the
morning break"

660
01:00:26,644 --> 01:00:30,740
"Let the night go on and on..."

661
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:53,394
"Lying to friends,
in somebody else's name"

662
01:00:53,572 --> 01:01:01,274
"About you and me.
All through the night"

663
01:01:01,445 --> 01:01:06,406
"You're away too long.
It's so difficult..."

664
01:01:06,652 --> 01:01:13,922
"to just sign and be contented"

665
01:01:15,694 --> 01:01:24,159
"When will the separation end?"

666
01:01:24,603 --> 01:01:32,306
"Come every day to me and
turn the night into a day"

667
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:45,216
"Without you, this wind from the east
seems silly"

668
01:01:46,423 --> 01:01:49,757
"It rushed into my scarf'

669
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:54,529
"You also come and embrace me
like this wind, some day"

670
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:03,098
"Come and embrace me,
like this wind..."

671
01:02:04,009 --> 01:02:08,411
"Listen, dear friend"

672
01:02:08,813 --> 01:02:17,279
"If I can't sleep tomorrow,
call me to you"

673
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:24,858
"Keep my head your lap
and sing me a lullaby"

674
01:02:26,096 --> 01:02:34,563
"Hug me to you under the sheet of the night,
on the sly"

675
01:02:35,139 --> 01:02:42,478
"Where even the moon can't approach.
Behind a cloud"

676
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:56,093
Dina, unlike me, is not so quiet.

677
01:02:56,094 --> 01:03:00,190
She talks a lot.

678
01:03:00,464 --> 01:03:04,960
She knows a lot.

679
01:03:05,637 --> 01:03:07,470
Don't go by what she says.

680
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:11,067
Dina is very simple... very tolerant.

681
01:03:11,277 --> 01:03:14,336
She has taken the responsibility
of the entire household and...

682
01:03:14,547 --> 01:03:17,981
...she never complains. Isn't it?

683
01:03:17,983 --> 01:03:21,219
In fact, it's the same case
with Raghu.

684
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:26,019
See, he hasn't even opened
his mouth so far.

685
01:03:26,558 --> 01:03:32,360
Raghu... say something.
If you say yes...

686
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:36,795
For us everything is alright... Why?
- I am agreeable too.

687
01:03:38,134 --> 01:03:44,336
But, you should ask Dina as well.
- Don't worry about that.

688
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:47,836
We called you only
when Dina said yes.

689
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:52,081
When you give your consent...

690
01:03:52,082 --> 01:03:55,185
We'll get an auspicious date fixed.

691
01:03:55,185 --> 01:03:59,248
And you've told that you're
not superstitious.

692
01:04:00,858 --> 01:04:05,353
Can I say something
if you don't mind...?

693
01:04:06,697 --> 01:04:10,598
Your younger daughter and my younger son
are both studying medicine.

694
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:12,002
What's it called?

695
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:14,437
Bio-Technology.
- Yes, Bio-Technology.

696
01:04:14,438 --> 01:04:19,274
He's doing a Masters degree.
We haven't asked Kartik, but...

697
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:23,014
We'll ask him and
you ask your daughter.

698
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:26,313
If they agree then, its God's will.
Both brothers and sisters...

699
01:04:26,518 --> 01:04:31,179
Can stay in the same house.

700
01:04:32,288 --> 01:04:35,124
What are you saying, mom?
How can this be?

701
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:38,288
If it can, what's wrong with it?

702
01:04:38,496 --> 01:04:40,562
It's like a yard sale.
Buy one, get one free.

703
01:04:40,563 --> 01:04:46,003
We are not selling our daughters.
They haven't even asked for a dowry.

704
01:04:46,235 --> 01:04:50,173
The boy is well educated.
This is a stroke of good fortune.

705
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:54,813
Why are you attaching my fortune with his?
- Speak softly.

706
01:04:54,813 --> 01:04:57,749
Wear this. - What's wrong in
what I am wearing?

707
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,918
I won't do it.
Mom, I cannot marry.

708
01:05:00,918 --> 01:05:04,649
It seems you're going to ruin
Dina's fortune. Wear this.

709
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:16,100
She got scared hearing about
her marriage.

710
01:05:16,101 --> 01:05:18,734
Even, I'd gotten scared.

711
01:05:18,735 --> 01:05:22,399
If I had any inclination that something
like this would happen,

712
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:24,706
I surely wouldn't have come.

713
01:05:24,707 --> 01:05:30,409
But, that's how my father is.

714
01:05:37,086 --> 01:05:42,750
Are you OK with it?

715
01:05:43,028 --> 01:05:47,192
I am already married.

716
01:05:58,442 --> 01:06:04,813
My parents don't know.
I married secretly in the court.

717
01:06:45,322 --> 01:06:48,813
11.30 PM, Marine Lines Station.

718
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,702
Railway Colony, Mumbai.

719
01:07:44,182 --> 01:07:45,916
Is Suhani here?

720
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:50,480
There is no one by that name here.
Get lost.

721
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:04,563
Where is Suhani?

722
01:08:16,981 --> 01:08:20,216
Where is Suhani?

723
01:08:20,216 --> 01:08:26,313
Where is Dina?
- She's not at home.

724
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,928
I am asking you to tell me
where Suhani is.

725
01:08:30,929 --> 01:08:35,327
What's happened to her?

726
01:08:37,135 --> 01:08:41,431
I don't know.

727
01:08:41,673 --> 01:08:47,073
She left the hospital at 5.

728
01:08:47,443 --> 01:08:50,971
It's 11 now...
there is no news of her.

729
01:08:54,318 --> 01:08:58,313
I've gone home twice.
There is no news of her.

730
01:08:58,788 --> 01:09:02,123
So, where has she gone?
You must have said something to her.

731
01:09:14,471 --> 01:09:18,000
22 years. Height 5 feet.
- And 2 inches!

732
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:23,746
Height 5 feet 2 inches.
Wearing a light brown Sari.

733
01:09:25,082 --> 01:09:29,519
A doctor's coat, hand bag,
stethoscope.

734
01:09:29,885 --> 01:09:33,288
Sir, there is a hospital
ID card as well.

735
01:09:33,289 --> 01:09:40,720
Hospital ID-card. Yes, just check
and call me.

736
01:10:02,519 --> 01:10:04,822
Uncle, are you going? - Yes.

737
01:10:04,823 --> 01:10:09,885
Leaving home and going away?
- Yes.

738
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,854
She's the one who should cry,

739
01:10:37,855 --> 01:10:40,058
whose marriage you have broken.

740
01:10:40,059 --> 01:10:42,058
I don't want to marry.

741
01:10:42,059 --> 01:10:44,292
Yes, why would you want to marry?

742
01:10:44,293 --> 01:10:46,528
She is the one in a hurry
to get married.

743
01:10:46,529 --> 01:10:49,989
The elder one is still unmarried and
the younger one has no patience.

744
01:10:51,501 --> 01:10:55,269
In six months she'll be abandoned
and be on the streets.

745
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:05,106
Get lost. There is no place for
you in this house.

746
01:11:05,384 --> 01:11:07,817
Be sensitive,
he's leaving the house.

747
01:11:07,818 --> 01:11:11,913
Whose house? When was this his house?
This is my house.

748
01:11:12,323 --> 01:11:15,390
Aditya, don't go away.

749
01:11:15,394 --> 01:11:17,859
Anyone who is stopping him
can leave with him as well.

750
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:21,885
Get out.

751
01:11:44,019 --> 01:11:48,077
Let it be.

752
01:11:53,163 --> 01:11:57,926
Get out of my house.

753
01:12:18,523 --> 01:12:21,826
From this day, we will have
no dealings with this house.

754
01:12:21,827 --> 01:12:25,260
Promise me. We'll never show
our face to them again.

755
01:12:26,264 --> 01:12:28,898
We both are enough for each other.
- OK.

756
01:12:28,899 --> 01:12:30,465
Take me to the temple.

757
01:12:30,466 --> 01:12:33,735
Why? Do you want to marry again?
- Shut up and get in.

758
01:12:33,737 --> 01:12:39,365
Okay, let's go.

759
01:12:47,386 --> 01:12:52,844
We carry the burdens of the world
on our heads.

760
01:12:53,157 --> 01:12:56,488
What are you doing? Be careful.
- Thank you. At least you noticed.

761
01:12:57,226 --> 01:12:59,263
The stove is a gift from me.
Buy yourself your own gas.

762
01:12:59,264 --> 01:13:03,899
I can gift you a matchbox.

763
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:06,703
What is all this?
- It belongs to my brother.

764
01:13:06,704 --> 01:13:07,803
Does he drink here?

765
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:10,206
All this will get shifted inside.
He'll drink in his section.

766
01:13:10,207 --> 01:13:13,708
This part of the house
belongs to you.

767
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:17,546
Hey kids! There is a great advantage
in eloping with a girl.

768
01:13:17,546 --> 01:13:21,246
The girl doesn't threaten to go back
to her parents every now and then.

769
01:13:21,585 --> 01:13:25,247
That is true.
She won't threaten.

770
01:13:25,457 --> 01:13:29,188
Yes, but there is also a problem.
- What's that?

771
01:13:29,726 --> 01:13:31,794
Eloping with girls...
will become a habit and...

772
01:13:31,795 --> 01:13:34,129
He'll keep running away
with all and sundry.

773
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:36,398
Did you weigh your profits and losses
when you eloped with aunty?

774
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:38,901
No, no. It was she who
made me run away.

775
01:13:38,902 --> 01:13:41,205
Really? How did that happen?

776
01:13:41,206 --> 01:13:44,274
I'd had a bit too much to drink.
I got emotional.

777
01:13:44,274 --> 01:13:47,573
Let's go.
- There is some left...

778
01:13:50,782 --> 01:13:53,581
What's the matter.
You seem to be very happy.

779
01:13:53,582 --> 01:13:57,914
Excited?

780
01:14:16,608 --> 01:14:21,101
"Soaring..."
"Are my dreams"

781
01:14:21,746 --> 01:14:26,377
"my heart dreams...
of colourful nights"

782
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:49,966
"The light mist that
descended last night..."

783
01:14:50,175 --> 01:14:52,676
"left my eyes brimming..."

784
01:14:52,677 --> 01:14:55,813
"as it pattered on my hands"

785
01:14:55,813 --> 01:15:00,305
"The joy of getting drenched in the
first rains of the season"

786
01:15:01,252 --> 01:15:03,553
"I was drenched in the first rains,
without a regret..."

787
01:15:03,554 --> 01:15:12,985
"all over town, without a regret"

788
01:15:14,296 --> 01:15:16,800
"Like her plaits in knots,
coming free..."

789
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:19,269
"it poured all night"

790
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,706
"At times, coaxing.
At times, tormenting..."

791
01:15:21,707 --> 01:15:27,729
"like the moods of my beloved"

792
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:51,189
"When I tease her out of love,
sometimes... she sulks"

793
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,071
"Even when I let go in
a fit of anger,

794
01:15:54,072 --> 01:16:00,039
"I have a battle on my hands"

795
01:16:01,813 --> 01:16:06,543
"Even if I simply kiss her,
I still have a battle to cope with"

796
01:16:06,752 --> 01:16:11,710
"The light of my eyes
means the life to me..."

797
01:16:11,957 --> 01:16:21,488
"in my eyes I preserve this life,
it's only for you..."

798
01:17:04,909 --> 01:17:09,539
"Few are the moments of life
to spend them in disagreement"

799
01:17:10,014 --> 01:17:14,643
"I have been through death to put
our fragile hearts together"

800
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:20,255
"Ask for anything and
I can present it to you"

801
01:17:20,556 --> 01:17:25,291
"But, do consider... there are very
few stars in the sky anyway"

802
01:17:25,496 --> 01:17:30,264
"The light of my eyes
means the life to me..."

803
01:17:30,766 --> 01:17:35,295
"even though my eyes have often
seen a sweet bitterness..."

804
01:17:35,505 --> 01:17:40,237
"this life, this life of mine..."

805
01:17:40,777 --> 01:17:42,513
"without a regret..."

806
01:17:42,514 --> 01:17:50,148
"all over town, without regret,
only for you"

807
01:17:51,222 --> 01:17:54,023
"Like her plaits in knots,
coming free..."

808
01:17:54,024 --> 01:17:56,493
"it poured all night"

809
01:17:56,494 --> 01:18:01,523
"Coaxing, tormenting...
like the moods of my beloved"

810
01:18:01,997 --> 01:18:04,367
"Soaring..."

811
01:18:04,368 --> 01:18:06,937
"are my dreams"

812
01:18:06,938 --> 01:18:11,601
"my heart dreams...
of colourful nights"

813
01:18:36,934 --> 01:18:42,561
Don't see through your right eye.
It's inauspicious.

814
01:18:43,407 --> 01:18:44,773
Where is the newspaper?

815
01:18:44,774 --> 01:18:47,243
I have been waiting for 15 minutes.

816
01:18:47,244 --> 01:18:48,812
Hoping that when you get up...
you will see me first.

817
01:18:48,813 --> 01:18:53,505
And all you want is the paper.

818
01:18:53,582 --> 01:18:56,151
OK, I've seen you.
Now, where is the paper?

819
01:18:56,152 --> 01:18:59,255
At night you were making many promises.
What happened now?

820
01:18:59,255 --> 01:19:03,315
Really? What was I saying?
- Liar.

821
01:19:03,525 --> 01:19:04,761
You aren't worried about your wife

822
01:19:04,762 --> 01:19:07,697
But, you want to know...
what's happening in Patna.

823
01:19:07,698 --> 01:19:10,131
Please give me the paper.
- You won't get it.

824
01:19:10,132 --> 01:19:12,600
You can't get your wife and
the news together.

825
01:19:12,601 --> 01:19:16,472
Suhani, where's the paper?

826
01:19:16,474 --> 01:19:22,636
But, what's happened in Patna?
- Riots have broken out.

827
01:19:26,283 --> 01:19:27,050
Where is the paper?

828
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:30,746
Here's your hot news.
- What madness is this?

829
01:19:31,523 --> 01:19:34,685
Hey kids! What's going on?
- Nothing.

830
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:38,485
Why are you burning the house?
All this won't do in someone else's house.

831
01:19:38,896 --> 01:19:42,159
But, this is my house...
- How's it your own house...?

832
01:19:42,367 --> 01:19:45,802
That will happen when you pay the rent.
What did you tell Pushy?

833
01:19:46,003 --> 01:19:47,870
That you'd pay 5 months rent
in advance. Where is it?

834
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:52,332
I said on the 1st... - The 1st went by
long ago. What's the date today?

835
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:56,671
No, I meant the 1st of next month.
- Uncle, the tea is getting cold.

836
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,947
Do you want to mix it?

837
01:19:58,948 --> 01:20:03,716
In front of this girl,
I cannot argue.

838
01:20:04,255 --> 01:20:07,621
Poor thing has left her parents house.
- And poor me.

839
01:20:07,823 --> 01:20:10,760
Even I have left my parents house.
- Left the house...?

840
01:20:10,761 --> 01:20:16,359
You must have been thrown out.
- Uncle, have your tea.

841
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:20,871
Meera, what happened to
that Sintel file?

842
01:20:20,871 --> 01:20:23,840
Bhaskar is working on
some more details.

843
01:20:23,841 --> 01:20:26,010
Are you people following it up
properly or not?

844
01:20:26,011 --> 01:20:29,274
Of course we are. But, there has been
no response from their side.

845
01:20:29,478 --> 01:20:31,045
But, what is the problem?

846
01:20:31,046 --> 01:20:34,118
Until their American Co-coordinators
don't approve the project...

847
01:20:34,118 --> 01:20:37,554
The deal cannot progress.
- Show me the file.

848
01:20:45,563 --> 01:20:49,590
No. Wrong number.
Some Anil Mehta.

849
01:20:54,072 --> 01:20:55,236
I had gone to buy vegetables.

850
01:20:55,237 --> 01:20:58,505
I've been waiting for you for an hour.
- Sorry.

851
01:20:59,944 --> 01:21:02,211
If you were going to take that long,
you should've left the keys with someone.

852
01:21:02,212 --> 01:21:03,913
With whom? Pushy Aunty?

853
01:21:03,914 --> 01:21:04,915
And what if she'd asked
for the rent?

854
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:09,052
So, should I just keep sitting...
until her Excellency arrives?

855
01:21:09,054 --> 01:21:11,956
Do you think I went for a stroll?
I had gone to shop for our dinner.

856
01:21:11,957 --> 01:21:15,823
But, what's the idea of making me
sit like a guard?

857
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:17,995
Why are you splitting hairs?

858
01:21:17,996 --> 01:21:20,464
Before marriage... you could wait for me
for hours at the station.

859
01:21:20,465 --> 01:21:24,198
Did you become a ticket checker
because of that? Come on.

860
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:28,002
It was another thing then. - What?
How was it different then?

861
01:21:28,974 --> 01:21:29,706
Open the door.

862
01:21:29,707 --> 01:21:31,742
We weren't married then... that's why.
- No... yes...

863
01:21:31,743 --> 01:21:33,876
And now we are married. So, you don't
care for me any longer?

864
01:21:33,877 --> 01:21:36,545
When did I say that?
- But, that's what you implied.

865
01:21:36,546 --> 01:21:38,648
Give me the key.

866
01:21:38,649 --> 01:21:39,513
Don't change the topic.

867
01:21:39,514 --> 01:21:41,751
Why don't you say it clearly...
that you don't need me anymore.

868
01:21:41,752 --> 01:21:45,121
Now, why are you splitting hairs?
Give me the keys.

869
01:21:45,121 --> 01:21:46,388
I won't give him any food.

870
01:21:46,389 --> 01:21:50,554
Once he sleeps hungry,
he'll realize.

871
01:21:52,728 --> 01:21:55,165
And remember this incident.
- And even you remember this... - What?

872
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:56,630
Every time you fight with me,

873
01:21:56,631 --> 01:21:58,700
I'll keep on making up
with you like this.

874
01:21:58,701 --> 01:22:02,103
Let go of me. Leave me.

875
01:22:02,104 --> 01:22:03,206
Not right now. Get lost.

876
01:22:03,207 --> 01:22:04,939
That's what you said before
marriage also.

877
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:10,931
Exactly. Because unlike you,
I've not changed after marriage.

878
01:22:11,216 --> 01:22:12,648
Now, what is this?

879
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:16,176
The days that you fight with me.
I will mark the calendar. - Why?

880
01:22:16,453 --> 01:22:18,822
To prove that getting married
is very risky business.

881
01:22:18,823 --> 01:22:22,725
That is true. Considering the way
you fight with me at night...

882
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:26,396
And bite and claw me...
Should I show you the marks?

883
01:22:26,398 --> 01:22:30,466
Do you want to see them?

884
01:22:30,466 --> 01:22:33,698
The mood is pleasant...

885
01:22:34,972 --> 01:22:35,638
What's it?

886
01:22:35,639 --> 01:22:37,872
Are you trying to find me?
I am here.

887
01:22:37,873 --> 01:22:39,408
Where is my mangalsutra?

888
01:22:39,409 --> 01:22:41,977
Forget it, I am alive right here
and ready to be hugged.

889
01:22:41,978 --> 01:22:45,416
You took it out at night
saying it pricks.

890
01:22:48,752 --> 01:22:52,188
I am the symbol of your marriage.
Why don't you hug me?

891
01:22:52,823 --> 01:22:56,257
You prick even more.
Where is my mangalsutra?

892
01:22:56,261 --> 01:22:59,659
Aunty... she'll ask for the rent.
Leave me, you shameless!

893
01:23:06,402 --> 01:23:09,004
How was it last night?
- What?

894
01:23:09,005 --> 01:23:13,966
Dhansak. Did you not eat it?
- Oh that! That was great.

895
01:23:14,179 --> 01:23:16,178
She cleaned up all of it.

896
01:23:16,179 --> 01:23:18,112
Now, you don't even need to
clean the utensils.

897
01:23:18,113 --> 01:23:22,916
Why don't you go and take the recipe
from Aunty this evening?

898
01:23:25,657 --> 01:23:28,389
What is this mangalsutra
doing here?

899
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:31,590
Suhani, this should not be taken off.
- Yes.

900
01:23:32,094 --> 01:23:33,263
I have been searching for
this all morning.

901
01:23:33,264 --> 01:23:34,862
It has to be your doing.
You must have hidden it.

902
01:23:34,863 --> 01:23:38,666
Why should I hide it?
I thought I should wear it.

903
01:23:38,936 --> 01:23:44,766
Sometimes even the man should
look married.

904
01:23:46,677 --> 01:23:51,438
How much sugar?
- One spoon.

905
01:23:58,487 --> 01:24:02,255
Here comes our friend. Wait and see.
He's going to start a fight.

906
01:24:06,563 --> 01:24:09,966
Wait for a minute.

907
01:24:09,966 --> 01:24:11,001
How are you? - Fine.

908
01:24:11,002 --> 01:24:14,869
Hello wife... how are you? Having tea?
- I'm fine.

909
01:24:16,608 --> 01:24:20,733
I'll just be back.

910
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:28,542
As long as you don't start it.

911
01:24:31,155 --> 01:24:34,180
Suhani, where is my
project report file?

912
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:39,929
Are you listening to me?
Where is my file?

913
01:24:39,929 --> 01:24:44,899
I've told you so many times...
not to move my things around.

914
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:51,268
Why are you laughing...?

915
01:25:01,118 --> 01:25:05,054
Please stop it. Don't inject him anymore.
- Suhani, take her out.

916
01:25:05,255 --> 01:25:13,823
Please come with me... come.
- No, I won't go.

917
01:25:14,032 --> 01:25:20,198
Come with me... Let the doctor
try at least.

918
01:25:20,403 --> 01:25:25,966
He's here for the past 2 days...
Nothing has been done.

919
01:25:36,918 --> 01:25:42,853
Suhani, what's there to eat?
I am very hungry.

920
01:25:48,233 --> 01:25:53,502
What happened?
- Let me stay like this.

921
01:25:53,503 --> 01:25:56,528
Everyone is looking.
- Let them.

922
01:26:00,377 --> 01:26:04,780
What's embarrassing? I am your wife.
Are you embarrassed...

923
01:26:05,782 --> 01:26:09,386
Be reasonable, let's go inside.
- Let your reasons be.

924
01:26:09,386 --> 01:26:15,353
Can you not even ask me
what I've been through?

925
01:26:18,527 --> 01:26:22,189
OK, I am sorry. I didn't know
what happened at the hospital,

926
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:24,198
I just thought...

927
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:27,966
Don't touch me.
- Are you an untouchable?

928
01:26:29,671 --> 01:26:32,806
You could always sense
my mood on the phone.

929
01:26:32,809 --> 01:26:35,178
Why are you so restless?

930
01:26:35,179 --> 01:26:39,841
You always knew the minute
you saw me.

931
01:26:40,515 --> 01:26:44,351
You used to call me twice a day
just to know how I was feeling.

932
01:26:44,554 --> 01:26:48,255
Don't you remember?
- I remember.

933
01:26:48,256 --> 01:26:50,626
In spite of living in the same city
and having a phone...

934
01:26:50,627 --> 01:26:53,652
You used to send me telegrams
to cheer me up.

935
01:26:53,862 --> 01:26:56,831
Where did all those things
got vanished?

936
01:26:56,832 --> 01:27:00,360
I am still ready to do all that.
But, when will you grow up?

937
01:27:00,603 --> 01:27:04,563
We aren't college students anymore.

938
01:27:05,073 --> 01:27:09,476
We are responsible for each other.

939
01:27:09,478 --> 01:27:15,275
Do people stop loving
after marriage?

940
01:27:43,746 --> 01:27:47,050
Don't stare like that.

941
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:50,506
Did you even think of us or try to
find out if we are dead or alive?

942
01:27:52,155 --> 01:27:54,121
Don't speak rudely, mother.

943
01:27:54,122 --> 01:27:59,426
Not one day has passed...
when I've not missed you.

944
01:28:00,198 --> 01:28:02,429
You could have come home also.

945
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:04,734
How could I have?

946
01:28:04,735 --> 01:28:09,139
Don't you remember what you and dad
said when you threw me out.

947
01:28:10,975 --> 01:28:13,640
Your father's tyranny will be
the end of us all.

948
01:28:13,641 --> 01:28:17,737
Lying in the hospital...
- What's happened to dad?

949
01:28:19,416 --> 01:28:20,916
I am not the doctor.

950
01:28:20,917 --> 01:28:25,679
We've got a lot of tests done, but...

951
01:28:27,122 --> 01:28:32,958
These tests are for jaundice.
Mom, I want to see dad.

952
01:28:35,966 --> 01:28:41,198
If you come, he will be pleased.
We have come to call you.

953
01:28:43,639 --> 01:28:46,666
But, don't tell him that we met.

954
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:01,858
Adi, Suhani is here.

955
01:29:01,859 --> 01:29:07,496
Hi. What happened?
How come you didn't go to work?

956
01:29:07,496 --> 01:29:13,623
Dad is in hospital...
can we go and meet him?

957
01:29:13,637 --> 01:29:20,006
It was you who said that we will
not keep any links with anyone.

958
01:29:20,576 --> 01:29:24,534
Now, what happened?
- Yes, but he is serious.

959
01:29:24,948 --> 01:29:28,716
He's in the Railway Hospital.
- Who told you?

960
01:29:28,716 --> 01:29:32,456
He's got jaundice.
He cannot be treated there.

961
01:29:32,457 --> 01:29:38,826
But, who told you? - Mom and Dina.
I met them in the train.

962
01:29:40,496 --> 01:29:44,024
They know where we live
and where I work.

963
01:29:46,436 --> 01:29:50,100
But, they didn't think it necessary
to tell me.

964
01:29:50,475 --> 01:29:55,811
It's not that.
Why do you think like that?

965
01:29:55,811 --> 01:29:59,213
I still remember my promise.
But you are forgetting yours.

966
01:30:00,851 --> 01:30:04,014
He spent his entire life's savings
to make me a doctor.

967
01:30:05,222 --> 01:30:06,654
What good is my being a doctor if...a

968
01:30:06,655 --> 01:30:11,059
Dr. Suhani, if your education is
compelling you, then you may go.

969
01:30:11,695 --> 01:30:15,431
Neither am I a doctor nor
am I compelled in any way.

970
01:30:15,432 --> 01:30:17,767
Why are you being indifferent?

971
01:30:17,768 --> 01:30:20,435
Other than the two of you...
I have no one.

972
01:30:20,436 --> 01:30:23,073
We are the only ones they have.

973
01:30:23,074 --> 01:30:26,802
Suhani, I have not forgotten
his slap till today.

974
01:30:30,012 --> 01:30:35,707
If you want to go, you may.

975
01:31:01,443 --> 01:31:06,002
How's your father?

976
01:31:06,384 --> 01:31:10,052
How do I know?.

977
01:31:10,052 --> 01:31:12,520
Didn't you go?

978
01:31:12,521 --> 01:31:15,759
How could I? I had promised.

979
01:31:15,759 --> 01:31:19,923
Then, break the promise.
Let's go tomorrow.

980
01:31:21,363 --> 01:31:23,897
What if he says something again?

981
01:31:23,898 --> 01:31:28,302
When I've been slapped by him,
how does a little scolding matter?

982
01:31:28,306 --> 01:31:34,432
Let's go tomorrow.

983
01:31:36,744 --> 01:31:42,878
Behave yourself in front of dad.
And... - I'm wearing this for your dad.

984
01:31:43,086 --> 01:31:47,045
Go fast - I am sorry. I am sorry.
- Take her there quickly.

985
01:31:47,256 --> 01:31:50,386
What...? - Go home.?

986
01:32:24,693 --> 01:32:29,461
Don't touch him.
Let his soul rest in peace.

987
01:32:32,536 --> 01:32:36,869
No child would've given so much
pain to the parents.

988
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:41,836
Now, take your husband and
leave our house.

989
01:32:42,612 --> 01:32:46,702
Mother...s

990
01:33:13,277 --> 01:33:17,765
Daddy...

991
01:33:45,475 --> 01:33:50,012
All my hopes are now pinned
on the Sintel project.

992
01:33:50,012 --> 01:33:53,539
If we lose that then, we'll
have to close the shop.

993
01:33:55,418 --> 01:34:01,113
With all the overheads...

994
01:34:02,559 --> 01:34:05,893
Now, stop it please.
How long will you keep crying?

995
01:34:07,931 --> 01:34:09,130
It's been so many days.

996
01:34:09,131 --> 01:34:12,693
What should I do if
I feel like crying?

997
01:34:15,204 --> 01:34:18,773
Had I not insisted on marrying,
all this would never have happened.

998
01:34:18,773 --> 01:34:22,972
It was I who had insisted
on marrying secretly.

999
01:34:23,547 --> 01:34:24,913
I was also so impatient.

1000
01:34:24,914 --> 01:34:28,015
If you are repenting it.
Why don't you leave me?

1001
01:34:28,018 --> 01:34:29,486
If I can live without my father,

1002
01:34:29,487 --> 01:34:35,511
I can live without you.
Leave me alone.

1003
01:34:45,636 --> 01:34:49,332
What should I say? - Just read what
is written. Come on try, please.

1004
01:34:49,573 --> 01:34:52,108
What if I get caught? Don't worry.
You just have to act a little.

1005
01:34:52,109 --> 01:34:54,209
Anyway, that's all you do
through out the day.

1006
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:55,111
I'll slap you...

1007
01:34:55,112 --> 01:34:58,512
Hello! This is...
- Like a woman... shyly.

1008
01:34:58,782 --> 01:35:01,911
Dina Sharma.
Do you remember me?

1009
01:35:02,652 --> 01:35:05,854
Mr. Sharma's daughter... Dina?

1010
01:35:05,854 --> 01:35:09,690
Yes, Miss Dina! What a surprise!
How are you?

1011
01:35:10,226 --> 01:35:15,460
I am fine. I wanted to meet you once.
- Me? What for?

1012
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:19,829
At 4 o'clock near the Kala Ghoda
parking lot...

1013
01:35:20,136 --> 01:35:23,538
Tomorrow.
Don't worry, I won't bite.

1014
01:35:35,853 --> 01:35:41,216
Can you connect me to Dina Sharma?

1015
01:35:45,029 --> 01:35:48,155
Miss Dina. Good morning,
this is Raghunath Pandit.

1016
01:35:49,332 --> 01:35:51,501
Maybe you didn't recognize me...

1017
01:35:51,502 --> 01:35:53,035
I recognize you very well.

1018
01:35:53,036 --> 01:35:54,671
What do you want from me?

1019
01:35:54,672 --> 01:35:56,237
I wanted to meet you.

1020
01:35:56,238 --> 01:35:59,640
Why? Was it not enough to
insult my family?

1021
01:35:59,909 --> 01:36:04,845
That's why... I mean... I want
to remove all doubts.

1022
01:36:05,381 --> 01:36:10,318
If you could meet me for 5 minutes...

1023
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,189
Please... only for 5 minutes.

1024
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:18,786
If you could meet me tomorrow at 4 P.M.
Near the Kala Ghoda parking lot,

1025
01:36:18,994 --> 01:36:23,359
I would be grateful.

1026
01:36:53,095 --> 01:36:56,731
Isn't that Raghu?
- It sure looks like him.

1027
01:36:56,734 --> 01:36:59,334
We were totally ruined after
that incident.

1028
01:36:59,335 --> 01:37:04,068
Dad passed away soon after.
But, why should it concern you... you...

1029
01:37:04,273 --> 01:37:08,234
I am sorry for what has happened.

1030
01:37:09,845 --> 01:37:13,372
But, it's unfair of you...
to blame me for all of it.

1031
01:37:13,582 --> 01:37:16,585
If that is your attitude...
why did you want to meet me?

1032
01:37:16,586 --> 01:37:19,221
Why did you call me here?

1033
01:37:19,222 --> 01:37:22,681
Excuse me, but it was you who
called me on the phone.

1034
01:37:22,893 --> 01:37:25,260
Otherwise, why would I have come?

1035
01:37:25,261 --> 01:37:26,528
The phone call was made by you.

1036
01:37:26,529 --> 01:37:29,588
I didn't even... do you think I had lost
it that I should have called you?

1037
01:37:29,932 --> 01:37:31,334
What do you think I am?

1038
01:37:31,335 --> 01:37:36,396
Looks like they are fighting.
Here is your coconut water.

1039
01:37:37,942 --> 01:37:42,677
I'm leaving.

1040
01:37:42,677 --> 01:37:45,877
Did you not call me... at the factory?
- Why should I?

1041
01:37:46,317 --> 01:37:50,252
You called me at the Bank.

1042
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:57,289
I did speak to you and you did
ask me meet you here.

1043
01:37:59,163 --> 01:38:03,493
Maybe you are...

1044
01:38:04,368 --> 01:38:08,595
Oh God!

1045
01:38:20,484 --> 01:38:22,352
So this was your doing.

1046
01:38:22,353 --> 01:38:25,720
What do you think you are?
A matchmaker?

1047
01:38:25,722 --> 01:38:30,520
Do you want to start
a marriage bureau?

1048
01:38:34,198 --> 01:38:39,225
Actually... Your marriage broke up
because of us. So I felt that...

1049
01:38:47,744 --> 01:38:51,077
It's OK. Your intentions were good.

1050
01:38:53,716 --> 01:38:57,914
But, you didn't do well...
especially with Dina.

1051
01:39:15,704 --> 01:39:18,832
It's been 10 days since we
spoke to each other.

1052
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:22,238
It's not unusual after marriage.

1053
01:39:22,845 --> 01:39:26,612
Look at Raj. Come.
We don't speak for months at end.

1054
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:30,719
All our exchanges are
through servants.

1055
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,722
I am beginning to feel that
Adi is tired of me.

1056
01:39:33,722 --> 01:39:35,825
Don't be stupid.

1057
01:39:35,826 --> 01:39:39,192
Everyone says that if Adi ever flirts...
with another girl,

1058
01:39:39,395 --> 01:39:41,730
He'll see you in her.

1059
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:46,859
Is that any less worrisome?

1060
01:39:52,707 --> 01:39:55,810
How is it?

1061
01:39:55,811 --> 01:39:58,314
Looks like someone is very thirsty.
Why...

1062
01:39:58,315 --> 01:39:59,980
The other day when I was giving
you coconut water...

1063
01:39:59,981 --> 01:40:03,041
You were glaring at me.
Am I a matchmaker...?

1064
01:40:03,252 --> 01:40:04,953
I should start a marriage bureau.

1065
01:40:04,954 --> 01:40:06,956
I think after this success...
I should start one.

1066
01:40:06,957 --> 01:40:09,691
And when should we arrange for
the wedding bells to toll?

1067
01:40:09,692 --> 01:40:11,493
Raghu, will you come on
a white horse?

1068
01:40:11,494 --> 01:40:12,960
Or must I get a black train
booked for you?

1069
01:40:12,961 --> 01:40:14,697
The day after tomorrow,
they are coming home.

1070
01:40:14,698 --> 01:40:20,164
Then, you can book
your black trains.

1071
01:40:22,137 --> 01:40:25,073
What happened?

1072
01:40:25,074 --> 01:40:30,077
I wish Dad were still alive.

1073
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:36,309
Have this coconut water and
stop the water from your eyes.

1074
01:41:02,811 --> 01:41:06,407
I have ordered food at home.
- What do you mean...?

1075
01:41:07,115 --> 01:41:11,451
Oh sorry! Those people didn't
have a place to party...

1076
01:41:11,654 --> 01:41:14,681
So, I called them here.
- I don't want to party.

1077
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:21,627
Did you ask me? - I didn't check...
but Anju asked and I said yes.

1078
01:41:22,231 --> 01:41:27,893
Is Anju going to decide...
what is going to happen in my house?

1079
01:41:30,872 --> 01:41:36,534
You should ask me...

1080
01:41:39,682 --> 01:41:41,517
So many people and
so little common sense.

1081
01:41:41,518 --> 01:41:47,076
An open door opens like this
and not like this.

1082
01:41:51,395 --> 01:41:53,426
She'll just be here..

1083
01:41:53,427 --> 01:41:56,565
You were very scared of your parents
...how did they agree?

1084
01:41:56,567 --> 01:41:59,201
I had to smuggle her out...
- You are quite brave.

1085
01:41:59,202 --> 01:42:05,073
This is nothing. One day she took
Bhaskar to meet her parents.

1086
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:07,410
You are quite an intelligent girl.

1087
01:42:07,411 --> 01:42:10,212
How did you ever get stuck
with this Bhaskar?

1088
01:42:10,213 --> 01:42:14,884
The same way I got stuck with her.

1089
01:42:14,884 --> 01:42:18,115
The minute I looked at her,
my mind started to wander.

1090
01:42:20,056 --> 01:42:21,590
You are a very
discouraging friend.

1091
01:42:21,591 --> 01:42:23,158
Get married first.

1092
01:42:23,159 --> 01:42:26,695
Then, you'll have to find out
the price of food grains.

1093
01:42:26,695 --> 01:42:28,064
Yes from Jeevan stores.

1094
01:42:28,065 --> 01:42:32,398
Suhani knows the rates quite well.
Remember...?

1095
01:42:32,402 --> 01:42:36,503
Men show their true colours
after marriage.

1096
01:42:36,505 --> 01:42:38,005
How's that?

1097
01:42:38,006 --> 01:42:42,411
Before marriage they are piling
on to you everywhere...

1098
01:42:42,845 --> 01:42:46,244
And after marriage they are
embarrassed to even hold you.

1099
01:42:47,416 --> 01:42:48,517
Does that really happen?

1100
01:42:48,518 --> 01:42:51,051
Yes. You are embarrassed
at your doing...

1101
01:42:51,052 --> 01:42:54,155
So the easy way out is a mangalsutra
to wear around the neck.

1102
01:42:54,155 --> 01:42:58,261
Before marriage every man
is special.

1103
01:42:58,261 --> 01:43:01,729
After marriage... he becomes
just another husband.

1104
01:43:01,731 --> 01:43:08,131
For me, Adi can never be ordinary.

1105
01:43:10,472 --> 01:43:13,909
I should have married you.
- What had to happen has happened.

1106
01:43:23,286 --> 01:43:27,722
You are tired of me now.
- What?

1107
01:43:27,722 --> 01:43:30,593
What were you saying?

1108
01:43:30,594 --> 01:43:34,722
Come on Suhani.
You know I was joking.

1109
01:43:35,264 --> 01:43:39,895
It didn't sound like a joke to me.
I've become stale.

1110
01:43:40,503 --> 01:43:42,636
Or have you started to
like someone else?

1111
01:43:42,637 --> 01:43:47,143
Stop this nonsense.

1112
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:51,177
You never spoke like this
before marriage.

1113
01:43:51,181 --> 01:43:55,612
I am now.

1114
01:44:01,890 --> 01:44:03,325
Nothing has changed even now.

1115
01:44:03,326 --> 01:44:09,488
If you like someone else
you can go with her.

1116
01:44:13,536 --> 01:44:15,603
Now, where should I find
another destiny?

1117
01:44:15,604 --> 01:44:17,672
You were destined for me.

1118
01:44:17,673 --> 01:44:23,164
And now I have to break my head with
you throughout my life.

1119
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:29,841
That's what you do best.
First, you taunt then you cry.

1120
01:44:36,326 --> 01:44:42,354
Do I trouble you so much?
What is my fault?

1121
01:44:42,898 --> 01:44:47,300
The fault is mine to have left
my parents for you.

1122
01:44:48,302 --> 01:44:52,737
Then, go back to them.

1123
01:45:32,113 --> 01:45:39,920
"A history of atrocities..."

1124
01:45:40,588 --> 01:45:47,023
"And yet, you claim authority"

1125
01:45:57,506 --> 01:46:00,609
"You take us by the hand
and hurt us"

1126
01:46:00,609 --> 01:46:07,070
"Good Heavens, no!"
"Good Heavens, no!"

1127
01:46:10,487 --> 01:46:13,648
"This is not done"

1128
01:46:14,155 --> 01:46:17,284
"A history of atrocities..."

1129
01:46:17,493 --> 01:46:20,655
"And it's blown out
of proportions"

1130
01:46:20,994 --> 01:46:24,199
"The lies in the world
now threaten my life"

1131
01:46:24,201 --> 01:46:25,799
"They're the ones who
inflict atrocities...

1132
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,535
"And they're the ones who complain"

1133
01:46:27,536 --> 01:46:33,202
"Good Heavens, no!"

1134
01:46:37,445 --> 01:46:42,509
"This is not done"

1135
01:47:04,506 --> 01:47:07,675
"Friends..."

1136
01:47:07,675 --> 01:47:13,238
"How am I to spend a lifetime
misled by illusions?"

1137
01:47:14,015 --> 01:47:19,886
"If only I could take away
your illusions"

1138
01:47:21,091 --> 01:47:25,890
"Take away this affliction
of love too"

1139
01:47:26,161 --> 01:47:32,100
"Let that be... or else
how will you manage?"

1140
01:47:32,701 --> 01:47:39,368
"Your attitude, your involvement
shall lead us on"

1141
01:47:39,807 --> 01:47:45,940
"Life's a boat sailing
miles across the sea"

1142
01:47:46,548 --> 01:47:52,351
"We'll have to drown in it,
there's miles of sea ahead"

1143
01:47:53,255 --> 01:47:56,725
"A history of atrocities..."

1144
01:47:56,725 --> 01:48:00,128
"And the pot calling
the kettle black"

1145
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:03,431
"The lies in the world
now threaten my life"

1146
01:48:03,432 --> 01:48:06,527
"They're the ones who inflict atrocities
and they're the ones who complain"

1147
01:48:06,735 --> 01:48:16,369
"Good Heavens, no!"
"Good Heavens, no!"

1148
01:48:16,579 --> 01:48:21,710
"This is not done"

1149
01:48:45,074 --> 01:48:47,709
I've been trying to find you for so long.
I searched everywhere for you.

1150
01:48:47,710 --> 01:48:49,844
Why? Is there something
very important?

1151
01:48:49,845 --> 01:48:55,011
Yes, it's important...
but now I am suddenly shy.

1152
01:49:01,591 --> 01:49:04,726
You... Dina...

1153
01:49:04,728 --> 01:49:07,957
I thought once things got
a little confirmed then...

1154
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:09,764
You were hiding it from me.

1155
01:49:09,765 --> 01:49:14,497
Of course not. I wanted to meet
and tell you myself.

1156
01:49:15,369 --> 01:49:18,673
That's why, I'd stopped Aditya
from tell you anything.

1157
01:49:18,673 --> 01:49:23,134
Aditya... he knows about
two of you?

1158
01:49:23,646 --> 01:49:29,637
He's the one who brought
us together again. - Yes.

1159
01:49:29,684 --> 01:49:33,451
Dina, I've got to meet Aditya.
- Go and meet Aditya.

1160
01:49:33,823 --> 01:49:39,789
I have to go to Raghu's house.
- To meet your mother-in-law?

1161
01:50:18,032 --> 01:50:21,993
We've got the 90 million project
from Sintel software!

1162
01:50:43,225 --> 01:50:45,227
Hey, what are you watching?
Is this a Ramlila?

1163
01:50:45,228 --> 01:50:46,761
Hey you! Stop there.
Where are you going?

1164
01:50:46,762 --> 01:50:48,060
Sir, I have to go to the station.

1165
01:50:48,061 --> 01:50:49,430
Do I have to write it down for you?

1166
01:50:49,431 --> 01:50:50,897
Can't you hear me?

1167
01:50:50,898 --> 01:50:51,566
Sorry sir, Sorry.

1168
01:50:51,567 --> 01:50:56,863
You can't go from here.
There's been an accident.

1169
01:50:57,073 --> 01:50:58,406
Take a U-turn and go back.
- OK, sir,

1170
01:50:58,407 --> 01:51:02,702
Go on.

1171
01:51:21,431 --> 01:51:23,264
What are you doing?
Waiting for Suhani?

1172
01:51:23,265 --> 01:51:24,331
Like always.

1173
01:51:24,332 --> 01:51:27,335
If you'd married me, you wouldn't
have had to do all this.

1174
01:51:27,336 --> 01:51:29,103
If she doesn't come in
the next ten minutes...

1175
01:51:29,104 --> 01:51:31,706
We'll run away to a temple
and get married.

1176
01:51:31,707 --> 01:51:36,298
Let's go.

1177
01:51:37,811 --> 01:51:41,782
Is Suhani there?
- She has left already.

1178
01:51:41,784 --> 01:51:45,619
Did she say where she was going?

1179
01:51:45,619 --> 01:51:50,747
Are you sure she is not somewhere
in the hospital?

1180
01:52:01,869 --> 01:52:07,862
YASHWANT RAO I.A.S. RESIDENCE

1181
01:52:16,386 --> 01:52:18,653
What happened?

1182
01:52:18,654 --> 01:52:22,824
Who was driving? You?

1183
01:52:22,826 --> 01:52:24,660
What was the need to drive?

1184
01:52:24,661 --> 01:52:26,160
You don't even have a license.

1185
01:52:26,161 --> 01:52:29,619
Are you OK?
Did anyone else get hurt?

1186
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:34,202
Did anyone?.

1187
01:52:34,202 --> 01:52:39,006
Tell me. Who was it?
- A girl.

1188
01:52:39,006 --> 01:52:41,676
How badly did she get hurt?
...Tell me...

1189
01:52:41,677 --> 01:52:45,613
Is she alive?

1190
01:52:45,613 --> 01:52:48,811
I don't know.
I got scared and ran away.

1191
01:52:51,353 --> 01:52:54,753
Good. It's all right. Did anyone
take her to the hospital?

1192
01:52:56,359 --> 01:52:59,527
Where did the accident happen?

1193
01:52:59,529 --> 01:53:03,865
Kennedy Bridge.

1194
01:53:03,865 --> 01:53:06,200
You relax. I'll go and
see what's happening.

1195
01:53:06,201 --> 01:53:12,067
Don't go.
- You go on inside.

1196
01:53:21,550 --> 01:53:25,487
Has an accident case from Kennedy
Bridge been reported today?

1197
01:53:25,487 --> 01:53:26,921
Yes, a girl has been admitted.

1198
01:53:26,922 --> 01:53:30,925
Is she your relative?
- What? Yes!

1199
01:53:30,925 --> 01:53:36,396
Inform Dr. Murthy and prepare
the O.T. You come with me.

1200
01:53:36,398 --> 01:53:41,195
Hurry up.

1201
01:53:44,405 --> 01:53:50,032
Doctor Khan, come to the
operation theatre. Quick.

1202
01:53:52,014 --> 01:53:56,038
Is she the one?

1203
01:53:58,820 --> 01:53:59,987
She is critical.

1204
01:53:59,988 --> 01:54:01,422
She has been hurt on her head.

1205
01:54:01,423 --> 01:54:04,425
Doctors can't operate on her until
someone takes her responsibility.

1206
01:54:04,425 --> 01:54:06,127
Give me the name.
- Yashwant Rao.

1207
01:54:06,128 --> 01:54:09,431
No, what's her name?
- Savitri.

1208
01:54:09,431 --> 01:54:12,701
Savitri. Savitri What?
- Savitri Rao.

1209
01:54:12,701 --> 01:54:14,769
How are you related to her?

1210
01:54:14,770 --> 01:54:15,603
Husband.

1211
01:54:15,604 --> 01:54:21,335
Oh Good. Come with me.
Some papers have to be signed.

1212
01:54:25,347 --> 01:54:26,112
Where are you coming from?

1213
01:54:26,113 --> 01:54:27,114
From the North.

1214
01:54:27,115 --> 01:54:29,049
Meaning? Are you coming from Kashmir?

1215
01:54:29,050 --> 01:54:32,452
No sir. North Bombay Society, Juhu.

1216
01:54:32,454 --> 01:54:34,388
And you...
- He is also... - Shut up!

1217
01:54:34,389 --> 01:54:37,158
What's your name?
- Aditya.

1218
01:54:37,159 --> 01:54:40,193
Where are you going?

1219
01:54:40,195 --> 01:54:43,460
My wife left home in the morning
and hasn't returned.

1220
01:54:44,067 --> 01:54:46,535
Have you lodged an FIR?
- Yes.

1221
01:54:46,536 --> 01:54:48,636
Have you checked the hospitals?
- What?

1222
01:54:48,637 --> 01:54:50,305
A girl met with an accident a little
distance from here.

1223
01:54:50,306 --> 01:54:54,771
Hospital...

1224
01:54:59,146 --> 01:55:02,350
Yes... Yes... I am speaking
from the hospital.

1225
01:55:02,351 --> 01:55:05,788
Because of the commotion I could
not report it earlier...

1226
01:55:06,154 --> 01:55:09,657
No, there is no need
to cover it up.

1227
01:55:09,657 --> 01:55:14,960
Let the law take its course.
I wanted... What...?

1228
01:55:16,164 --> 01:55:21,125
No, her relatives have not
been found yet...

1229
01:55:24,039 --> 01:55:26,508
Has an accident case of
a girl been reported?

1230
01:55:26,509 --> 01:55:28,042
When? - This evening...e

1231
01:55:28,043 --> 01:55:30,676
What's the name?
- Dr. Suhani. Suhani Sehgal.

1232
01:55:30,677 --> 01:55:32,846
There is no one by this name.

1233
01:55:32,847 --> 01:55:35,181
In an emergency case, they obviously
won't know the name.

1234
01:55:35,182 --> 01:55:38,019
Please check for a 22-23
year-old married woman.

1235
01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:38,787
Just a minute.

1236
01:55:38,788 --> 01:55:43,020
Mrs. Savitri Rao. Her husband is on
the phone over there.

1237
01:55:43,523 --> 01:55:46,594
His wife is in the trauma centre.

1238
01:55:46,595 --> 01:55:52,326
Is there any other?
- No.

1239
01:55:57,606 --> 01:56:01,207
Relax, Adi. I think we are
being too pessimistic.

1240
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:02,710
Never mind. Let's go home.

1241
01:56:02,711 --> 01:56:04,210
Maybe she has reached home.

1242
01:56:04,211 --> 01:56:06,547
Inform me as soon as you
get some information.

1243
01:56:06,548 --> 01:56:08,215
Yes, I am at the Wadia hospital.

1244
01:56:08,216 --> 01:56:12,512
I'll talk to you later.

1245
01:56:23,966 --> 01:56:27,023
We cannot remove the clot
without a surgery.

1246
01:56:42,918 --> 01:56:46,216
Our area starts from this side
of the bridge...

1247
01:56:46,422 --> 01:56:49,591
If the blast is on that side...

1248
01:56:49,591 --> 01:56:51,660
Can't you see that I am
talking to someone?

1249
01:56:51,661 --> 01:56:52,760
I see that sir.

1250
01:56:52,761 --> 01:56:53,761
For the last half an hour...

1251
01:56:53,762 --> 01:56:56,465
You have been going from one side to
the other side of the bridge.

1252
01:56:56,466 --> 01:57:00,800
I'll call you back.

1253
01:57:00,802 --> 01:57:02,435
What is your problem?

1254
01:57:02,436 --> 01:57:04,772
Sir, it's been so long since
I lodged an FIR.

1255
01:57:04,773 --> 01:57:07,608
My wife is missing.
Have you found anything?

1256
01:57:07,609 --> 01:57:09,276
We'll tell you when we find out.
Now, go away.

1257
01:57:09,277 --> 01:57:11,112
Will the news travel to you?

1258
01:57:11,113 --> 01:57:12,779
Sir, at least make an attempt...

1259
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:13,781
Make some enquiries.

1260
01:57:13,782 --> 01:57:15,450
You should know who she has
run away with.

1261
01:57:15,451 --> 01:57:18,619
Why are you wasting my time...?

1262
01:57:18,619 --> 01:57:20,453
How dare you assault a cop
inside a police station...?

1263
01:57:20,454 --> 01:57:21,621
How dare you talk about
my wife...?

1264
01:57:21,622 --> 01:57:22,288
Leave me. Let me go...

1265
01:57:22,289 --> 01:57:23,290
What if I don't leave it.
What can you do?

1266
01:57:23,291 --> 01:57:28,759
Even you'll be reported missing.

1267
01:57:29,832 --> 01:57:31,799
Sir, he's the son of
Barrister Seghal.

1268
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:37,427
His wife has been missing
for so many hours...

1269
01:57:43,811 --> 01:57:47,815
I told you I'd take care of everything.
Why did you come here?

1270
01:57:47,817 --> 01:57:52,253
You are taking care... of me.

1271
01:57:52,253 --> 01:57:55,323
The surgery is over... but your wife
is still unconscious.

1272
01:57:55,324 --> 01:57:57,858
You'll have to wait.

1273
01:57:57,859 --> 01:58:01,295
I hope there is nothing to fear?
- She's still in coma...

1274
01:58:20,347 --> 01:58:22,215
We have located the FIR.

1275
01:58:22,216 --> 01:58:24,352
The girl's husband has lodged it.

1276
01:58:24,353 --> 01:58:26,685
His name is Aditya Sehgal.

1277
01:58:26,686 --> 01:58:27,689
It won't be difficult to trace.

1278
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:30,191
You don't have to worry now.

1279
01:58:30,192 --> 01:58:33,693
Even he is tracing her frantically.

1280
01:58:33,695 --> 01:58:36,529
You both go home.
I'm here, isn't it?

1281
01:58:36,530 --> 01:58:42,835
No. We'll wait here. Once we have
handed this girl over...

1282
01:58:44,039 --> 01:58:48,109
Then, it's up to him.

1283
01:58:48,109 --> 01:58:51,878
What can the poor boy do
in this crisis?

1284
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:55,338
Don't worry. Savitri didn't do
it deliberately.

1285
01:58:55,784 --> 01:58:58,319
It's an accident.

1286
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,518
Whatever it is.
We'll wait here.

1287
01:59:03,893 --> 01:59:10,190
OK... I'll go and locate him then.

1288
01:59:16,003 --> 01:59:19,074
Is there a Aditya Sehgal among you?
- Yes. I am.

1289
01:59:19,074 --> 01:59:22,875
Aditya. Did you lodge an FIR
about your missing wife?

1290
01:59:23,077 --> 01:59:25,746
Yes... have you found anything?
- What was she wearing?

1291
01:59:25,747 --> 01:59:28,415
A light brown sari.
- Any watch or handbag?

1292
01:59:28,416 --> 01:59:31,252
Yes. A watch, a handbag, stethoscope.
I had lodged everything...

1293
01:59:31,253 --> 01:59:32,921
Come with me. - Where?

1294
01:59:32,922 --> 01:59:39,048
To your wife. Come on, sit inside.

1295
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:55,905
Over there. She is in the ICU.

1296
02:00:09,859 --> 02:00:14,591
Suhani. Open your eyes.

1297
02:00:17,065 --> 02:00:19,867
You would talk throughout the day.

1298
02:00:19,868 --> 02:00:22,537
Now, why don't you speak?

1299
02:00:22,538 --> 02:00:26,875
Say something. Open your eyes.

1300
02:00:26,875 --> 02:00:30,606
Are you angry with me...
Please don't be...

1301
02:00:32,479 --> 02:00:37,110
Open your eyes.
Say something please...

1302
02:00:57,338 --> 02:01:01,806
Let us check...

1303
02:01:31,207 --> 02:01:34,209
That's the man whose car hit Suhani.

1304
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:39,175
He's signed for the surgery as well.

1305
02:01:58,734 --> 02:02:04,862
How is she...?

1306
02:02:07,442 --> 02:02:12,038
You should pray... for yourself.

1307
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:19,550
If anything happens to her...
I won't let you live in peace.

1308
02:02:35,436 --> 02:02:40,061
How did you hit her?

1309
02:02:41,809 --> 02:02:47,244
And why didn't you tell the police?

1310
02:02:50,485 --> 02:02:55,247
You were drinking and driving,
weren't you?

1311
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:09,091
I won't let you get away.

1312
02:03:15,309 --> 02:03:20,277
It's not his fault.

1313
02:03:21,648 --> 02:03:25,652
Then, whose fault is it?

1314
02:03:25,654 --> 02:03:28,489
The one who is battling
for her life?

1315
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:36,795
No harm will befall her. Before it does,
I will kill myself.

1316
02:03:46,173 --> 02:03:49,802
I hit her. It was my car.

1317
02:03:50,512 --> 02:03:52,011
Why should you be punished for that?

1318
02:03:52,012 --> 02:03:55,643
No harm will befall her.
There is a God above.

1319
02:03:56,885 --> 02:04:02,818
What we could do, we have done.

1320
02:04:16,704 --> 02:04:19,540
You can give us whatever punishment
you want to.

1321
02:04:19,541 --> 02:04:25,845
But, right now even we are praying
for your wife's recovery.

1322
02:06:01,143 --> 02:06:06,213
I know you are listening
to everything.

1323
02:06:06,215 --> 02:06:09,483
You are just pretending...

1324
02:06:09,483 --> 02:06:13,443
To trouble me... to fight with me.

1325
02:06:17,693 --> 02:06:22,130
Come now, get up. Right now.

1326
02:06:26,166 --> 02:06:31,238
Aren't you going to mark the
date on the calendar?

1327
02:06:31,238 --> 02:06:34,242
You didn't come home one day,

1328
02:06:34,242 --> 02:06:39,447
And everything is devastated...

1329
02:06:39,447 --> 02:06:42,474
How much I searched for you today...

1330
02:06:43,684 --> 02:06:48,653
I didn't search for you like this
even before marriage.

1331
02:06:51,858 --> 02:06:59,492
The truth is that today I have
understood our relationship.

1332
02:07:01,869 --> 02:07:06,329
For the first time I have
understood you. Found you.

1333
02:07:10,045 --> 02:07:14,282
Now, I can't lose you.

1334
02:07:14,282 --> 02:07:19,845
Till now I was only trying
to find myself.

1335
02:07:40,576 --> 02:07:44,872
Please come back...

1336
02:08:47,809 --> 02:08:50,310
Were you scared?

1337
02:08:50,311 --> 02:08:54,608
I just died.

1338
02:08:55,483 --> 02:08:57,984
What did you think?

1339
02:08:57,985 --> 02:09:02,615
That I'd let you flirt with
other women so easily?

1340
02:09:15,170 --> 02:09:20,135
What can you do for me?

1341
02:09:21,844 --> 02:09:26,012
Can you jump off a moving train?

1342
02:09:26,014 --> 02:09:31,309
Never say this for fun also.
