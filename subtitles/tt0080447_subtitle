1
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,996
What is your name, my son?

2
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,994
Hussain.

3
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,516
The sworf of Yazid
has scarred your face.

4
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,711
From where have you come?

5
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,595
From the cradle of the past.

6
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,955
From the tomb of the future.

7
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,236
From the circle of the present

8
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,639
We are prisoners of our destiny.

9
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,152
Our journeys curve to their beginnings.

10
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,633
Your namesake, Imam Hussain,
defied the usurper Caliph

11
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,799
and stamped the plain of Karbala
with his own blood.

12
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,994
We must mourn the blood
that quenched the parched sands.

13
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,315
We must mourn until the Last Day

14
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,152
forever tears away the web of time.

15
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,873
Get out of the way!

16
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,952
Hey Monkey, you're okay now.

17
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,515
You've made it to the top.

18
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,711
You're the President.

19
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,279
You control television,
radio and the press.

20
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,391
You oppress the people.

21
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,799
Any comment, Mr President?

22
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,558
He says democracy is dead.

23
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,876
And you're in real trouble.

24
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,591
Get them out.

25
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,710
- What's wrong?
- The mare's giving birth early,

26
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,270
Welcome, Selim Sahab.

27
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,198
How are you?

28
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,755
Well, thank you. Is Hussain here?

29
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,599
He's in the stables.

30
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,356
Selim Sahab is here.

31
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,079
Welcome, brother.

32
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,955
Akbar, show Selim Sahab my new horse.

33
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,514
Yes, Sir.

34
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,276
Akbar, what's wrong with Hussain?

35
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,079
Why is he quarrelling
with the authorities?

36
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,115
What can I say?
He's a headstrong young man.

37
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,837
He won't listen to anyone,
but, God willing, he'll settle down.

38
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,110
Go ahead, I'll get the horse.

39
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,591
At Karbala, Imam Hussain declared:

40
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,918
<i>"In this place I will be buried</i>

41
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,920
"until the Day of Judgement.

42
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,911
"Here I will receive thirteen wounds.

43
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,795
"My sisters will witness
my death from their tents.

44
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,996
On the seventh day,
Yazid's army barred access to the river.

45
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,594
On the eve of the tenth day,
Hussain addressed his followers:

46
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,715
"O companions, my faith is in you.

47
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,789
“Now that night has fallen,
extinguish the lanterns in the camp,

48
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,038
"take my family and escape
under the cover of darkness.

49
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,879
"The dispute with Yazid is my concern.

50
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,072
"I alone shall die for the faith.”

51
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,876
They replied,
"Here we will be killed but once.

52
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,197
"But even if we were to suffer many deaths,

53
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,635
"and our ashes
were scattered to the winds,

54
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,832
"never would we leave your side.”

55
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,873
The tenth day dawned.

56
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,393
Hussain's followers were massacred.

57
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,394
Hussain rode his white horse
onto the plain of Karbala.

58
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:45,000
He said, "O believers in my grandfather,
why spill my blood?"

59
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,637
They replied,
"Swear allegiance to Yazid

60
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,912
"and your life will be spared.”

61
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,318
Hussain replied,
"I am the Prophet's grandson.

62
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,514
"I can give up my life
and the lives of my children.

63
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,314
"I can sacrifice the sanctity
of my sisters.

64
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,876
"But I will never accept
the supremacy of Yazid.

65
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,359
Hussain drew his sword
and spurred on his white horse.

66
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,117
Yazid's soldiers attacked him

67
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,551
and inflicted thirteen wounds.

68
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,560
Hussain was martyred in Karbala.

69
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,911
There is no parallel in history.

70
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,271
Every age breeds a Yazid,

71
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,439
but Imam Hussain remains unique.

72
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,514
<i>By his death Islam is reborn ...</i>

73
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,073
In this locket are sacred verses

74
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,558
to guide you on your life's journey.

75
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,435
Go in peace, my son.

76
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,435
You have travelled far, Hussain.

77
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,351
But you are still a stranger to yourself,

78
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,391
Can a man be a stranger to himself?

79
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,354
Misfortune in love
is not life's only sorrow.

80
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,117
Not only in you
does my happiness reside.

81
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,757
Ask not of me, my love,
the passion we once shared.

82
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,195
You are not destined to understand.

83
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,919
Hussain, one day from your body
there will open many wounds,

84
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,670
from whence will spring your force
to feed a multitude.

85
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,353
You have the blessing of God, Hussain.

86
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,673
With the help of the Unseen, you will be
called upon to dispense justice.

87
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,070
I have nothing else to give you
but this prophecy.

88
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,592
<i>Misfortune in love
is not life's only sorrow.</i>

89
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,157
<i>Not only in you
does my happiness reside.</i>

90
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,234
<i>Ask not of me, my love,
the passion we once shared.</i>

91
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,440
Come.

92
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,752
Let us pray together.

93
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,355
Akbar, my horse knocked over a girl.

94
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,751
I don't know if she was hurt.
She ran away.

95
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,154
Go and see if she's all right.

96
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,160
How do I find her?

97
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,238
At least can you describe her to me?

98
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,639
She is beautiful, with long black hair.

99
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,033
You describe her beauty.

100
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,758
That won't help me find her.

101
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,877
She was wearing a black skirt,

102
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,952
and around her neck
she wore a big locket set with jewels,

103
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,674
This is her shawl.

104
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,515
Hussain Sahab, she is my daughter.

105
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,991
Please sit down.

106
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,079
Smoke, sir.

107
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,073
Who do you want to see?

108
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,636
Selim Murtaza.

109
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,516
What do you want with him?

110
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,910
It's personal. He's my brother,

111
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,918
You're Selim Sahab's brother?
Your name?

112
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,553
Hussain.

113
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,318
Selim Sahab's brother is here.

114
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,913
You can go in.

115
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,753
Hussain Sahab, is all well?
You should have sent for me.

116
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,952
Please sit down.
I will be with you in a moment.

117
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,558
- What brings you here?
- Please sit.

118
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,269
I have come myself
to discuss an important matter.

119
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,600
You're welcome. What is it?

120
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,035
Akbar, I've come to ask
for your daughter's hand.

121
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,397
My daughter's hand?
On whose behalf?

122
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,313
I wish to marry her.

123
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,199
Hussain Sahab, what are you saying?

124
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,118
How can this be?

125
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,713
What will your family say?

126
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,354
I don't care what they say.

127
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:50,671
Please rest assured
that I will honour and cherish her.

128
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,678
Some villagers wish to see you, sir.

129
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,599
Send them in.

130
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,759
Please come in.

131
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,912
Come and sit down.

132
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,196
Sit down.
Will you eat with me?

133
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,913
Bring food for them.

134
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,192
Is all well?

135
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,631
Hussain Sahab ...

136
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,431
...we have many problems.

137
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:12,878
We try o live in peace.

138
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:18,591
But it seems we are not destined to.

139
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,836
Our lives are devoid of happiness.

140
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,119
Speak plainly.

141
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,797
They have seized more of our lands.

142
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,919
- When?
- This morning.

143
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,669
We have struggled to remain on our lands,

144
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,716
but they refuse to let us,

145
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,314
They outnumber us.

146
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,238
They are very powerful.

147
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,549
Don't worry.

148
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,829
All right.

149
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,112
Whoever has suffered a loss,
I will compensate with a piece of my land.

150
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,794
Thank you, sir.

151
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,392
Are you in pain?

152
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:53,430
Now my time has come, my son.

153
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,394
But do not be alarmed.

154
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,752
I am at peace with the world...

155
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,879
...and I await my end.

156
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,591
You are troubled, my son?

157
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:28,149
Many years have passed
since you prophesied.

158
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:36,398
I am married now
and my wife is with child.

159
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:50,069
Much has happened in the world
since you withdrew from it.

160
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,313
Yet nothing has changed.

161
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,159
Mankind still suffers injustice
at the hands of powerful men.

162
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:15,279
I know I am destined. .

163
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,632
... to die for humanity.

164
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,156
But I am confused.

165
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,753
I have received no sign.

166
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,511
You will receive no sign.

167
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,836
You are yourself the sign.

168
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,596
Now leave me to sleep.

169
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,635
I am nearing that ocean...

170
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,513
. that awaits us all.

171
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,275
I must prepare myself

172
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:31,234
There is but one God...

173
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,159
and Muhammad is His Prophet

174
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:58,795
Hussain Sahab,
the soldiers have killed many of our men

175
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,232
There's a price on your head.

176
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,829
We must leave the village at once.

177
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,393
Get everyone ready.

178
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,639
Praise God, you have a son,

179
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,754
- How is the mother?
- The mother is well.

180
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,351
But there is no water,
not even to cleanse the child.

181
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:41,913
Don't worry, we are near a river.
We will find water.

182
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,591
Find a way out

183
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,073
There is no way out

184
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,318
We will camp here.

185
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,237
- All right,
- Go on

186
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:56,715
- Tell the men ...
- Yes, sir.

187
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,319
Come closer.

188
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:14,599
Tell the men to extinguish
the lanterns in the camp.

189
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,436
Yes, Sir.

190
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:26,152
Whoever wishes to leave
under cover of darkness,

191
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,759
I will not begrudge them.

192
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,439
Yes, Sir.

193
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:36,960
All right, sir.

194
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,073
All right, sir.

195
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:27,315
Hussain Sahab has malaria.

196
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:34,275
He has asked me
to extinguish the lanterns.

197
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:40,635
Anyone who wishes to leave
TR

198
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,512
with his blessing.

199
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,799
We will stay,

200
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,358
Water.

201
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,750
Give my son water.

202
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,869
Give my son water!

203
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:37,318
Water!

204
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:42,035
Hussain lives forever!

205
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:45,949
Death to the tyrant
