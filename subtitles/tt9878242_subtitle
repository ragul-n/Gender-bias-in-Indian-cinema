Helping hands are better than praying lips
MOTHER TERESA

3
00:03:53,667 --> 00:04:01,667
SHUBHARATHRI

4
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:07,475
SEVERAL YEARS BACK

5
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,684
Stop here

6
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,688
Why here?
-You stop here

7
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,992
Charlie...the bike belongs the workshop.
Boss will get angry

8
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,389
You don't panic.
Let him go there and come back

9
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,665
What is the matter?

10
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:27,830
He will tell

11
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,833
What is he going to do?

12
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:32,997
It will bring trouble

13
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:46,375
Come

14
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,017
You swine...
Move

15
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:52,883
Take it.
Come fast

16
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,059
Leave me

17
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,690
You leave me...

18
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,262
Run... Take the vehicle

19
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,559
Go now... fast

20
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:04,868
Let's go fast

21
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:44,153
{Announcement from the mosque)

22
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:48,869
ljaz, 32 years, son of Pazhangad
Kochuparambil Unmer Master

23
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,195
died in Syria. Condolences

24
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,999
Let Allah bless the deceased

25
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,726
Greetings, President

26
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:14,685
When?

27
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,490
Isn't that investigated by NIA?

28
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,231
Okay Okay,Af 
 will tell the Cl

29
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,281
Sir, that old NIA case...

30
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,244
Which one?
-That Ummer Master's son's...

31
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:45,922
Panchayat President has called to
tell that he got killed while in Syria

32
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,587
There was someone else also with
him... What was his name? ljaz?

33
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,296
No sir. ljazwas the
one who got killed

34
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,526
Panchayat president said there is
a WhatsApp message informing his killing

35
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:56,893
There is no information
about the other person

36
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,609
It's a burden for us, Joseph...

37
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,944
You go now.
Let me call SP

38
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,087
Jinu, our channel is breaking the news first

39
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:23,029
Not just that we reported first that ljaz and family
went to Syria from Saudi to join a terrorist outfit

40
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,335
From a land like Kerala...

41
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:35,839
Afithe mindset of those who
go to join IS is surprising

42
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:36,870
Terrible

43
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,843
Many things done in the
name of Islam is un-Islamic

44
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,349
The Holy Quran doesn't approve all these

45
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:45,843
Islam is the religion of peace

46
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,286
It is for the unseen heaven...

47
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,048
that they destroy this beautiful world...

48
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:55,160
and become suicide bombers
to live with beauties

49
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,294
What a pity!

50
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:03,626
We had earlier reported that during the recent past ljaz and
his friend Navas were included those who went to join IS

51
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,169
There is no news yet about Navas

52
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:11,802
Sradha, the news about ljaz's death was informed
to Ummer's family by his wife through Whatsapp

53
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,180
This was first brought out by our channel

54
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:18,079
Not just that. The news of ljaz
and his wife Riya going to Syria...

55
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,150
...was also first reported by our channel

56
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,248
Okay Reshmi

57
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,955
In the terrorist attacks that happened
in Sri Lanka during Easter...

58
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:29,158
..NIA is investigating the involvement of ljaZ's
gang

59
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,869
Greetings

60
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,696
Brother, my daughter...

61
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:43,705
By God's grace, there is no issues
for her as per latest info

62
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:45,971
Come

63
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,880

 don't know anything
more than this, Sulaiman

64
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:53,380
Sulaiman, please don't ask anything
more to Ummer. You sit there

65
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:57,747
My son...

66
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,795
We knew about this from Riya's message

67
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,869
How will she and their son bear it?

68
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:13,298
Don't cry, Nabeesu

69
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,765
Think that is God's decision

70
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,074
We have to suffer this pain

71
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,784

 haven't even seen the
face of my grandchild

72
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,047
Don't cry, daughter

73
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,119
Don't cry, Nabeesu

74
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:34,119
Drink this.
- don't want, Khadeeja

75
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,455
How can you survive without
eating and drinking anything?

76
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,163
Have this... Drink a little

77
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,965
Ummer... What is that we are hearing?

78
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,232
I don't know

79
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,102

 don't know anything

80
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:25,878
Listen to this...

81
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,872
This is me Riya. Greetings

82
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,943
He has left, dad

83
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,790
Yesterday noon while
we were having lunch...

84
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,159
commandos came and took him

85
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,999
It was late in the night

86
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,764
that they came and informed

87
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,237
he has died

88
00:12:54,775 --> 00:13:01,306
Here me and my son are with five
women from Mumbai and Hyderabad

89
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:09,887
There is no information about their husbands
or my husband's friend Navas

90
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:15,354
There are only gun shots all around

91
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,855

 am scared, father

92
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,394
We can't escape from here

93
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:26,104
Forgive us

94
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:31,340
We could not live the way
you would have wanted

95
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:36,815
Please convey my regards to Mom...

96
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,319
What a good boy he was

97
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:43,580
What happened to him?

98
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:44,550
Madness

99
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,291
Total madness

100
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,894
The fanaticism where humans are not seen as
such and instead divided into religion and caste

101
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,303

 had decided not to
shed a tear drop for him

102
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,368
But when 
 saw you...

103
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,474
He defeated me

104
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:11,144
What have 
 become
after teaching for 30 years?

105
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,920
The father of a terrorist
who died fighting for the IS

106
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:19,387
Don't say like that

107
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,463
Stop there

108
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:28,826
Ummer

109
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:32,462
They ruined my son

110
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:36,907
Get out of my house

111
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,259
Greetings... please take your seat, sir

112
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,061
You sit, sir

113
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:03,297
Muhammed, you sit as well

114
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:04,635
Sit

115
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,669
We came just as part of a formality

116
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,969
It's a case investigated by
NIA. They called us

117
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,942
They will reach here soon

118
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,981
Consider this as a routine
police enquiry before that

119
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,919
How did you know about the death?

120
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,591
Sir, the boy who died is called ljaz

121
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,891
His wife had sent a message
to Ummer saying this

122
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,389
At what time did you get this message?

123
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,656
After 7 in the morning

124
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,326
That message?
-This is the one, sir

125
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,927
He is gone, father

126
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,366
ljaz went to Syria from Saudi?

127
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:12,398
Yes sir

128
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,700
How was he? Was he involved with
any groups while he was here?

129
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:18,609
No sir

130
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:19,377
Yes sir

131
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,008
He was angry when 
 asked him about
some books that he was reading

132
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,248
That was the beginning

133
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,520
Then there were some new friends

134
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,188
I thought he left it all when he reached Saudi

135
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:31,213
But...

136
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,687
Okay... Okay

137
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,567
Sir, SP is coming to our office

138
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:51,736
Master...

139
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,239

 can't assure you

140
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,218
If 
 get your son's body...

141
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,118

 don't want to see, sir

142
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,089
He did not die fighting for his country...

143
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:07,557
lam a devout Muslim

144
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,561
He did something that
God will never forgive

145
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:12,598

 don't want to see

146
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,491

 don't want to see

147
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:24,642
He has a son

148
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:26,274
My grandson

149
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,672
Muhammed Sherif

150
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,141
If he is found

151
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,484
please hand him over to me

152
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,346

 want to grow him as a human

153
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,701
Here comes Thomachan

154
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,269
Give me some space

155
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:04,409
Slowly

156
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:10,154
How was the celebration?
- Not that great?

157
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,785
It was his wish.
So 
 gave the nod

158
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,327
Isn't that the right thing to do?

159
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:16,426
They have to live together

160
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:22,097
In these times it is foolish to think
that our children should live like us

161
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,800
We are no longer young

162
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,435
Even if Thomachan had not agreed

163
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:28,332
He would have married that girl

164
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:32,237
That was why 
 agreed even
though they are converted

165
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,477
No wonder there is the old saying about not
to depend too much on kids or sprouts

166
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,481
See Ummer's case now

167
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,383
It is a bit too hard for him

168
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,254
He had great hopes

169
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,457
Compared to that Thomachan is lucky

170
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:48,386
Me? Lucky?

171
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,860
The luckiest among us is Muhammed

172
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,264
Our children should learn from Shanavas

173
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,301
When are you going for Haj

174
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:03,866
This Thursday

175
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:06,213
You forgot what 
 said?

176
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:09,249
I forgot in the midst of this marriage

177
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,852
If ll was in Muhammed's place...

178
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,551
I would have gone for 4 or 5 Haj trips

179
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:21,725
(reciting a holy verse from the Holy Quran)

180
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,627
This is what Quran says

181
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:24,897
Which means

182
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,233
If it is possible for you...

183
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,932
If you have no enmity towards anyone

184
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:33,833
If you are not indebted
to your friends or relatives

185
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,910
If you have Halal wealth

186
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,910
You should go for Haj once

187
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,409
It is said "once"

188
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:45,453
Sunnath is what is done
twice or thrice... Just a ritual

189
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,219
Wealth is not the criteria
when it comes to Haj, Moideen

190
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,884
Have you noticed the dressing
style of those who do 'tawaf'?

191
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:56,859
Before God the rich and the
poor is alike.. is the message

192
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,265
See.. this is the fact

193
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,831
True

194
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:13,805
Allah... what is this?

195
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,241
There are so many dishes today

196
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,281
It is from Sulochana's house

197
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:20,445
Today was there was a
ceremony at their house

198
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,292
I had told them while going to
Ponnani that 
 can't reach there

199
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:28,257
The wedding of Thomachan's son was also
today

200
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:30,624
So finally Thomachan agreed?

201
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:32,227
He did...

202
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,299
But he is not fully convinced

203
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,801
Why?

204
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:42,370
Did you have your medicine?
-Yes 
 did

205
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,275
And the breathing pump?

206
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,814
That 
 will do while going to bed

207
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:51,315
This is your problem

208
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:54,685

 have to keep a tab of everything

209
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,822
Let me ask you something

210
00:20:58,692 --> 00:20:59,716
When you go for Haj

211
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:03,431
Who is there to ask me all this?

212
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,897
That is why 
 said we will go for Haj together

213
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,800
Then she has breathing problems

214
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:11,436
It's not the reason

215
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:14,239
You are scared to fly

216
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,309
How relieved 
 would have
been if you were there too?

217
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:23,315
If you go it's the same... like me going

218
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:32,984
This time 
 will have special prayers so that
your fear to travel in aeroplanes is over

219
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:51,707
Just to show me

220
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,372

 saw

221
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:57,743
It's going to rain

222
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,083
Are any clothes lying outside?

223
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,455
Nothing outside

224
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,321
Will know in the morning

225
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:08,393
Have to go to Eriyad in the morning

226
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,591
Need to get blessings from aunt

227
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,294
Will she?

228
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:14,730
I don't know

229
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:18,435
The fight is almost 45 years old.
She would forgive

230
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,604
That is because you don't know her well

231
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:23,739
I have no hopes

232
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,512
After dad died, even before completing 40
days...

233
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:32,115
uncle had left the house with aunt
after demanding their share

234
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,081
They didn't inform even when he died

235
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:40,587
God... the power goes
when lightning begins

236
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:44,563

 don't think power will come
tonight. You sleep now

237
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,096
Why has the inverter not been repaired yet?

238
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,603
The mechanic is not well

239
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,404
You go and sleep

240
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:05,576
Who are you?

241
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:11,891
Sister... 
 am Muhammed, from Edavanakkad

242
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,758
Oh God... Please come in

243
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:20,925
1 didn't recognise you...
-It has been so many years now

244
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:22,430
Please come inside

245
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:26,033
Please sit

246
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:34,747
Where is Moothumma?

247
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:37,450
She is lying down

248
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:39,818
Who is there?

249
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:44,855
It's me, brother

250
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:48,757
God... who is this!

251
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:01,870
Are you fine?
-Seeing you is the greatest happiness

252
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:05,509
Sit here

253
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:10,913
How are you, son?

254
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,484

 am going for Haj

255
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:17,182
When?

256
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,925
This Thursday?
-Which Thursday?

257
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:21,153
Coming Thursday

258
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,225
Good

259
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:27,896

 came to seek aunt's blessings

260
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,430
Aunt?

261
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,574
Why are you standing here?
-Go and make tea

262
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:43,178
Oh 
 forgot that

263
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,835
Moothumma, you didn't say anything

264
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,478
You come

265
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:26,191
We all thoughts it's her regular attitude.
Later we realised it is because of her illness

266
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:30,889
It has been like this for
more than an year now

267
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:35,067
Did she understand what all 
 said?

268
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:36,603
Of course she did

269
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:41,540
She will ask about it. Maybe today
or two days later. She would...

270
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:46,502
This is okay. At times she
become really stubborn

271
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:49,105
She will get things done with her attitude

272
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:59,025
Brother, when she asks please tell her
that 
 came and that 
 am going for Haj

273
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:03,755
Shall 
 leave now?

274
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,965
If 
 made you sad with my deeds...

275
00:26:15,843 --> 00:26:17,777
Please forgive me

276
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:25,611
Before my dad died...

277
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:27,950
He told me something

278
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:31,915
He told me there will be day when

 would have to tell you this as well

279
00:26:33,961 --> 00:26:35,588
After the death of dad's younger brother

280
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:38,130
Dad made the issues deliberately

281
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:42,733
The plan was to do partition
and to leave the ancestral place

282
00:26:44,638 --> 00:26:46,367
Even if it was me in his place...

283
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,165

 would have done the same

284
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:53,040

 don't understand what you are
saying. Can you be more clear?

285
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,845
Seven girls, two boys and the parents

286
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,688
Your dad died when 11
of us were in dire straits

287
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:06,854
You, your sisters and your mother...

288
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:09,926
when it came to taking
the burden of four more...

289
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:13,597
Dad's idea was that family feud...

290
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:17,963
The desperation of a man who
found it hard to feed eleven

291
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:21,801
Leave it brother.
It's all over now

292
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,073
Yes

293
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,742
But dad was remorseful
about it, A until his death

294
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:35,913
Even when he was away,
dad loved you a lot

295
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:41,728
He was proud about your
efforts that saved the family

296
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:45,394
He said only thing while in his death bed

297
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:48,894
To tell you this one day

298
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:56,903
You have to forgive us, son

299
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,964
God, how hot it is...

300
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:22,758
Your children and grand children have come,
right?

301
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:26,300

 am on my way back from
Eriyad. They did call me

302
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:28,666
Brother, Gold...

303
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:34,141
George...
-How come you are here?

304
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:37,977

 came to have a lime juice.
-l was about to come to your place

305
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:40,113
But then 
 fell ill

306
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,786
The AC in the inverter...
-How will there be AC in inverter?

307
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,923
That AC is not this one
-Then which AC

308
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:49,157
AC - Alternating Current

309
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,123
There are so many
things that you don't know

310
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:55,497
The AC and capacitor of that inverter
is not available anywhere

311
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:59,462

 have ordered it at a place. They
will deliver the moment they get it.

312
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,934
1 will repair it right then

313
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:03,967
Your fever is gone?

314
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,812
It is actually there inside...

 am really tired

315
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:09,346
You are smoking even then?
-Cigarette?

316
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,982
Yes. You asked for **. Here it is

317
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,183

 said cold. The tablet for cold.

318
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:18,355
Is this a medicine store to sell tablets?

319
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,325
You bought the same
cigarette yesterday as well

320
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:22,461
How much lies you are saying?

321
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:24,024
If you don't have it, say so

322
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:26,230

 will come with the AC then.
-Okay

323
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,495
If you want the cigarette you take
it. Or else 
 will keep it inside.

324
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,867
If we smoke this... with vicks...
it is good for cold,Af]

325
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:38,511
Af[They say it works...

326
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:40,814

 will come then.
-Okay

327
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:44,316
You wait for your fever to go.
-George there. Stop the car.

328
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:47,047

 will come to your place tomorrow

329
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:51,016
Not tomorrow. You get inside now

330
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:53,788
Get in now

331
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:56,395
Go now

332
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,364
Finally, George's issue has been solved

333
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:03,535
Will they beat him up?
-No

334
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:06,366
If you cheat others without doing
your job this is what happens

335
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:08,766
Three batteries too

336
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:20,043
You are the only one who
buy batteries even now

337
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:23,519
All others have upgraded themselves to
electric torches and emergency lamps

338
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:27,189
My dad used to take this torch long back

339
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,929
Only this remains that was with my dad

340
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,792
It is still in good condition. It works.

341
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:36,930
Here is the money. Keep the
change. Let me go

342
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:45,077
Dad has come

343
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:47,375
Greetings

344
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:52,880
The journey was good?

345
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:56,624
Ameer, you have gained weight?
Hello Riyas

346
00:30:57,424 --> 00:30:59,153
Your mom said you all
didn't get tickets together

347
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,888
We were planning to come with
Shanu. He is always busy

348
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:04,628
Or else me and Alnama would
have come two days earlier

349
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,531
Is it so? Anyways good to see you all together

350
00:31:08,102 --> 00:31:09,331
Where are the kids?
-They are inside

351
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,632
Grandpa's children... you come here

352
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:20,973
You became thin?
You have started wearing glasses?

353
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:23,947
Where is our Ummukulsu?

354
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,645
What is she doing there?
-She is into something there. You come with us

355
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:29,548
What is that?

356
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:37,596
What is she doing all alone there?

357
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:47,068
Where?
- Right there

358
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:54,538
You smart girl...

359
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,314
Looks like a bride

360
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:05,649
Come here

361
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,097
We have been telling you
for so long to keep a maid

362
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:17,333
Isn't it?

363
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:21,971
Alnama, you don't know your dad's nature?

364
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:25,612
He won't eat anything
other than what 
 make

365
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,907
You say something that is possible

366
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:31,344
Don't blame our dad, Mom

367
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:32,651
We know you well

368
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,588
You don't like us getting into
the kitchen...forget maid then

369
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:57,438
How hot it is

370
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:59,405
You start sweating once you go out

371
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:04,247
Did you meet aunt?

372
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:08,016
Things are not like what we imagine

373
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:10,212
Moothumma has no memory

374
00:33:10,757 --> 00:33:12,623

 have told them about going for Haj

375
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,198
It's good that 
 went there
for blessings forgetting the fights

376
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,224
Will any of them come here?

377
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:23,632
Majeed will come

378
00:33:27,474 --> 00:33:28,600
There is some news

379
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:31,109
Alnama is pregnant

380
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:33,236
This is their fourth, right?

381
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:36,413
Riyas has nothing else to do?

382
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:39,647
Why do you say this about our kids?

383
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,613
Still there should be some reason

384
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,181
Dinner is ready?

385
00:33:44,658 --> 00:33:47,650
Rice gruel and gram, right? That is ready.
-No, the kids are here

386
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:50,193
They are cooking in the kitchen

387
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,562
Let me lie down for a while

388
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:03,209
My father is also going for
Haj in the same flight as you

389
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:06,371
Please take care of him too

390
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:11,446
He is still very active.
Tell him to take care of me.

391
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,784
Isn't that our Salam?
-Yes, Beedi Salam

392
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,383
The one who cheated you

393
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:22,219
You carry on. 
 will be back

394
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,820
Don't forget Thursday's matter

395
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:32,101
Where were you all this while, Salam?

396
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:35,270

 was in Bombay. 
 was planning to meet you

397
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:36,370
Where is Jameela and your kids?

398
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:38,835
They are all gone, brother

399
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:42,683
My troubles started when 

went away with your money

400
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,676
They all left me

401
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:47,280
Don't cry.
Where do you live now?

402
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:53,150

 have back to my ancestral house. My parents
have been telling me to meet you and apologise

403
00:34:53,794 --> 00:34:57,822
But 
 stayed away as 

was ashamed to face you

404
00:34:58,666 --> 00:34:59,656
Forgive me

405
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:04,631
That is okay. 
 know you
were too naive to do it so

406
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:06,664
Anyone can make a mistake

407
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,405

 had seen you like my Shanu

408
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:13,503
That is my only grief

409
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:18,251
Stop crying

410
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:22,845
For all the deeds...
Pray to God asking for forgiveness

411
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,156
Go now

412
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,220
Go and pray

413
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:29,797
Come home this Thursday evening

414
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:31,454

 am going for Haj

415
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:39,396
Dad, here is your phone

416
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,537
Riyas, Sameer had called

417
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,368
He said he won't come today
-Is it so?

418
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:47,404
Shanu, what do you plan to
give those who come on Thursday?

419
00:35:48,182 --> 00:35:49,377
Thursday?
Yes

420
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:57,415
Mom, what did Dad say about
the food on Thursday?

421
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,555
You all can decide about it, right?

422
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,924
If it is so then why can't we order
it from some catering service?

423
00:36:02,296 --> 00:36:03,388
They will take care of everything

424
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:06,530
Dad doesn't like too much extravagance

425
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:09,569
Anyways, maximum a biryani... right?

426
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:12,368
That is enough

427
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,568
Then why go for catering service?
It is biryani, right?

428
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:18,571
That we can manage ourselves

429
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:25,283
You didn't have food?

430
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,456
You come here, cutie pie

431
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,423
Shall 
 give you biryani?

432
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:45,262
Is she having?

433
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:49,175
Why are you having rice gruel and gram?

434
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:50,974
It was my habit for quite long

435
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:54,873
Dad is content if he has a
blue shirt and rice gruel and gram

436
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,550
I haven't forgotten anything as 

didn't change my habits, son

437
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,735
When they all left, it has all become so silent

438
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,841
At least the kids could have stayed back

439
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:28,848
Will you let your kids stay away?

440
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:33,612
Even this Shanu used to sleep with us in the
bed until he was in his eight standard, right?

441
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:37,655
Alnama and Sulnama used to sleep
with us until their marriage

442
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:40,721
Our children are repeating what we did, that's
all

443
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,990
When you go for Haj

 will ask them all to stay here

444
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:50,736
They live in their houses only
when they come on leave

445
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:55,738
You do one thing. You go and stay with
each of them when 
 go for the Haj

446
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:57,501
You need a change as well

447
00:37:58,479 --> 00:37:59,469

 can't do that

448
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:01,811

 can't sleep if 
 stay elsewhere

449
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,318
And then she blames the children

450
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:23,565

 saw our Salam today

451
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:26,600
At the mosque

452
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:29,967
He looks insane now

453
00:38:34,014 --> 00:38:35,277
Did you talk to him?

454
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:40,281
After he did all the harm?

455
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:43,488
Not one or two... 20 lakhs

456
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:46,685
He took 20 lakhs...

457
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:50,898
Can we forget that so fast?

458
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:57,064
We saw him like our own son...
and not even as Shanu's friend

459
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:58,398
leave it

460
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:04,677
Still... it was with the advance for Shanu's plot...

461
00:39:06,447 --> 00:39:07,573
Afthat he went away

462
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:09,878
Take this

463
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:23,096
Come... lie down

464
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:32,799
Now you feel better?

465
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,507
Lie down then

466
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:44,744
You don't listen to me when 
 tell you not
to panic over unnecessary things

467
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:54,160
If you won't panic, 
 will tell you one more thing

468
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:57,727
Tomorrow is the registration in our children's
name

469
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:04,632
The shops in the town are for Shanu, right?

470
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:06,472
It is well earning

471
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:10,477
We already have given enough
dowry for Alnama and Sulnama

472
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:13,439
What?

473
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:19,612
Nothing... it would be a surprise if an
average mother doesn't say this

474
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:21,386
You lie down now

475
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:25,482
Will go to Vincent to see the draft, tomorrow
morning

476
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:27,619
The registration is at 11.30

477
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:37,632
The rights of your daughters in the
properties including the shops...

478
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:42,575
will be there respectively for their husbands too

479
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:43,039
Yes

480
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:48,411
It's a joint document, isn't it?

481
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:51,507
For the son too?

482
00:40:53,887 --> 00:40:56,720
My son's wife is my own daughter, sir?

483
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:02,021

 have no doubts about the joint ownership

484
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:03,921
Can 
 sign?
-Yes

485
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:17,539
As per Sharia law, while sharing the
properties...

486
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:21,074
half of what is given to sons
need to be given for daughters

487
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:24,910
But 
 have shown any difference between my
son or daughters

488
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:27,515

 have shared the properties equally

489
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:29,579
Are you sad about it?

490
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:30,856
What for, dad?

491
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:33,717
Do you feel you got less?

492
00:41:35,763 --> 00:41:36,855
Aren't they my sisters, dad?

493
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:40,895
Even if you give our share to
them, we will be happy

494
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:43,831
There is nothing more than being your children

495
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,737

 forgot to tell you something.
What?

496
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:55,174

 saw Suhara aunty at Dubai airport

497
00:41:57,985 --> 00:41:59,714
She was going to London

498
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,621
1 told her about you going for Haj

499
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:51,864
It can't happen, Muhammed.
Keep that wish to your mind

500
00:42:52,306 --> 00:42:55,708
Good idea to marry off your sisters

501
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:59,802
You won't marry Suhara until 
 am alive

502
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:07,352
Dad, are we going home straight?

503
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:09,352
What?
-Going home straight?

504
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:13,894
No... we have to meet someone

505
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,261
You go to Thamaravattam, son

506
00:43:17,197 --> 00:43:17,663
Okay

507
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:38,809
Son. isn't this A C Suresh's house?

508
00:43:39,787 --> 00:43:41,016
AC? Grandpa...

509
00:43:43,891 --> 00:43:44,619
What happened. children?

510
00:43:51,365 --> 00:43:52,127
Who is that?

511
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,207
You didn't understand me?

512
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:03,043
It is me, Muhammed

513
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:06,312
We studied in Class VI
together in the government school

514
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:12,208
K P Muhammed?
-Yes, that one

515
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,853
Come, let's sit there

516
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:20,152
Daughter, bring a chair.
-l will sit here. 
 don't need a chair

517
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:22,159
Your clothes will be soiled.
-That's okay

518
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:26,957
Who?
-My old friend, Muhammed

519
00:44:28,802 --> 00:44:30,292
What's her name?
-Susheela

520
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:32,067
You make tea

521
00:44:33,107 --> 00:44:35,303
Your daughter?
-My daughter in law

522
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:38,039
What is your son doing?
-He is a painting worker

523
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:39,771
You don't paint now?

524
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:43,079
After the coming of flex, drawing is less

525
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:45,051
How did you find my house?

526
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:49,718
You brought me here,
during a temple festival

527
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:51,919
You had great memory even then

528
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:53,916
Why did you come in search of me now?

529
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:56,025

 wanted to tell you something

530
00:44:56,764 --> 00:44:57,856

 am going for Haj

531
00:44:58,332 --> 00:44:59,663
When?
-Tomorrow

532
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:04,666
We have some rituals before going for Haj

533
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:10,369
If we have done something wrong to anyone, we
have to go and apologise and make things right

534
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:16,245
Have tea.
-It's black tea

535
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:17,409
That is fine, daughter

536
00:45:22,323 --> 00:45:23,950

 came to seek your approval

537
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:25,287
From me?

538
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:26,720
What for?

539
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:30,898
You remember the day when
our results for Class VIl came?

540
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:33,467
We all got promoted to Vi

541
00:45:34,334 --> 00:45:35,961
You and Kaleshan failed

542
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:41,501
When you failed, everyone mocked you

543
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:45,769
You got angry and you pushed me hard

544
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:50,345
from the ground 
 threw a stone, still lying
down

545
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:53,486
When blood started coming out of
your forehead, 
 ran away

546
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:58,783

 still remember you covering the
wound and standing there, crying

547
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:01,827
My dear Muhammed, 
 have forgotten it all by
now

548
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:04,162

 can't forget all that

549
00:46:05,532 --> 00:46:08,797
You have to forgive me for
the sin that 
 did then

550
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:10,301
What are you saying, Muhammed?

551
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:12,971
What all we do during younger
days without knowing

552
00:46:13,507 --> 00:46:14,497
You forget it now

553
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:17,101
Will you come to my house today evening?

554
00:46:18,011 --> 00:46:21,037
No need for that, Muhammed.
-Why? You have to come

555
00:46:21,548 --> 00:46:23,482

 will believe you have
forgiven only if you come

556
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:25,042
You to come for sure

557
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:29,480
Muhammed

558
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:36,955
After all these years, how come you
haven't forgotten that day?

559
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:39,525
My dad died that day

560
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:10,495
Leave Alnama this time.
Let her be here for two months

561
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:15,497
Greetings... you go inside, daughter

562
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:18,371
Com here, son. Sit there

563
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:22,006
Who is this?

564
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:28,371
Umma (Mother)...

565
00:47:32,653 --> 00:47:34,121
How long it has been since we met

566
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:36,818
That's why 
 came as well.
-Good

567
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:41,918
Alnama, you know who this is?
-Of course, we remember it all

568
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:48,062
We won't forget even if you do. She missed her
Gulf trip because of your flying sickness

569
00:47:48,669 --> 00:47:50,467
Keep laughing

570
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:57,202
If she hadn't taken care of me at the AirPort like a
family member, 
 would have been in the graveyard

571
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:24,266
Allah,Af who is this

572
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:30,636
She has been insisting to come to
your house from morning

573
00:48:31,678 --> 00:48:32,668
Come inside, aunt

574
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:35,638
Shanu, see who has come

575
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:43,917
Do you remember all of us, aunt?

576
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:47,257
She is not in a state to identify all

577
00:48:49,296 --> 00:48:50,422
This is your daughter in law

578
00:48:51,165 --> 00:48:53,327
Khadeeja, you take her inside

579
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:55,895
Come inside, brother

580
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:03,441
This is Thomachan.
This is Ummer Master

581
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:09,215
You sit. 
 will bring something to drink

582
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,213
Take something to drink

583
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:15,081
You are still staying in Eriyad, right?

584
00:49:16,256 --> 00:49:19,191
He was really tense when
he set out to meet you

585
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:22,121
He didn't know how you would receive him

586
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:26,599
Anyways, all good.
He has no one else as his brother

587
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:28,327

 know

588
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:37,336
But... we were sad about leaving him alone. That
was why we didn't meet him after dad's death

589
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:40,379
God will shower his blessings

590
00:49:41,582 --> 00:49:44,517

 have seen once. Do you remember?

591
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,584
When uncle died, isn't it sister?

592
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:52,686
She sat there with a poker face even then

593
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,061
Did you understand who these are?

594
00:49:56,764 --> 00:49:59,096
My daughters. Alnama and Sulnama

595
00:50:01,268 --> 00:50:02,633
This is my daughter in law

596
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,210
This is brother's only son, Shanavas

597
00:50:09,743 --> 00:50:11,006
We call him Shanu

598
00:50:20,054 --> 00:50:20,782
Do you know me?

599
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:27,760
God

600
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:40,403
Doctor, this is Shanu.

 will give the phone to dad.

601
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:41,273
One minute

602
00:50:42,443 --> 00:50:45,140
Greetings doctor. You are not seen here yet

603
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:47,777
One of my patients is serious here

604
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:50,779
Okay. Patients' issues are
obviously more important

605
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:53,412
You bought all the medicines
that 
 prescribed?

606
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:56,653
All those medicines have been bought and
packed

607
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:59,786
It shouldn't just be left like that.
You have to take them as well.

608
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:03,120
1 will... 
 will have them promptly

609
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,128
Okay doctor. 
 will pray for you too

610
00:51:09,503 --> 00:51:10,129
Okay doctor

611
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:15,699
Is that Suresh?

612
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:19,509
Why is he hesitant?

613
00:51:21,648 --> 00:51:22,843
Suresh, why did you remain here?

614
00:51:23,651 --> 00:51:25,847
Since you asked me to come.
-Good

615
00:51:26,487 --> 00:51:28,649
Shall 
 leave?
-Then why did you come?

616
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:31,321
To go.
-You come inside

617
00:51:31,692 --> 00:51:33,126
No Muhammed. 
 will come later

618
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,289
You come inside, Suresh

619
00:51:36,497 --> 00:51:37,862
You are coming to my home for the first time

620
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:40,259
You come here

621
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:43,329
Ummer, you recognise him?

622
00:51:45,172 --> 00:51:48,506
This Suresh. He studied with us

623
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:51,805
The one whom you threw a stone at?

624
00:51:52,246 --> 00:51:54,510
Thamaravattom Suresh?
-Yes, the same person

625
00:51:55,749 --> 00:51:58,684
You come and sit here

626
00:52:04,158 --> 00:52:05,455
This is Majeedikka

627
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,121
Suresh, you recognised me?

628
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,164
You know him?

629
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,792
He was there when I studied in Class VII

630
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:16,526
He created record in school as a failure

631
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:18,694
Is there any class where you haven't failed?

632
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:23,169

 have failed in 5th, 6th and 7th

633
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:26,811
Then what about 2nd and 3rd?
-That was long back

634
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:32,450
When my elder sister's daughter came in the
same class 
 stopped going to school

635
00:52:33,287 --> 00:52:38,384
When classmate was calling me
"uncle" it was shameful

636
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,753
It's not the studies but
our pride is more important

637
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,570
It seems we are late.
-No, we aren't

638
00:52:50,604 --> 00:52:51,935
You have the snacks

639
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:57,536
Rameshan and Sadiq are missing.
-Rameshan's kid had to be taken to hospital

640
00:52:58,479 --> 00:52:59,708
Sadiq will come for sure

641
00:53:01,315 --> 00:53:03,716
Salam... Greetings

642
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:05,946
Happy that you came

643
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:16,920
Salam, it has been so long since we met

644
00:53:22,336 --> 00:53:23,428
What happened?

645
00:53:24,772 --> 00:53:27,798
I thought you will be furious to see me

646
00:53:28,776 --> 00:53:29,675
Please forgive me

647
00:53:29,843 --> 00:53:30,810
What for?

648
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:32,711
It's all over

649
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,276
Come and meet mom

650
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:36,579
Go

651
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:15,649

 am chanting twaha to
the creator of the world

652
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:21,962

 am a droplet in the soul of an
ocean that you are, my Lord

653
00:54:23,531 --> 00:54:26,330
From Mecca to Madeena

654
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:29,427

 travelled to all the abodes of Nabi

655
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:34,334
The journey to find the true self in me

656
00:54:35,843 --> 00:54:42,613
Allah...you are the beginning and my only
resort

657
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:10,010
All become equal here through the Lord

658
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:16,814
Let my mind travel in the sacred path of God

659
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:22,781
The amazing journey begins with the kiss at
Hajar al aswad

660
00:55:23,424 --> 00:55:29,454
You find the eternal spirit from source of the
holy Zamzam

661
00:55:30,731 --> 00:55:35,897
Shed the heaviness of sins at Mina

662
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:42,669
You go on this holy trip

663
00:56:17,144 --> 00:56:20,910
The invisible Lord owns of the whole world

664
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:27,579

 hereby present myself to you in a platter

665
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:35,126
After clearing off all the debts here [ come
towards the moonlight

666
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:40,697

 am a slave to the love that vanishes all the
borders

667
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,677
Shall 
 leave then?

668
00:57:35,256 --> 00:57:38,715
Shanu, it is cloudy. You give an
umbrella to Ummer Master

669
00:57:43,897 --> 00:57:46,832
Won't you pray for my son too?

670
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:49,197
You need to tell me that?

671
00:57:49,903 --> 00:57:51,701
He is like my son Shanu

672
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:55,773
It's heavy rains

673
00:58:45,726 --> 00:58:46,284
Isn't that Suhara?

674
00:59:24,832 --> 00:59:26,163
Why do you both look so shocked?

675
00:59:31,372 --> 00:59:34,603
If you see your childhood sweetheart
accidentally after some decades,Af


676
00:59:35,009 --> 00:59:36,909
Aflanyone will be shocked

677
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:39,305
When did you come, Suhara?

678
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,947
lam on my way

679
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:50,124
Lord... what am 
 seeing?

680
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:54,855
Alnama, Sulnama,A{ look who has come

681
00:59:56,397 --> 00:59:57,057
Come

682
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:03,262

 learned about the news. My condolences

683
01:00:04,204 --> 01:00:05,763
You come inside

684
01:00:07,975 --> 01:00:08,840
Son, give me the umbrella

685
01:00:24,658 --> 01:00:30,153
Suhara, all these years without seeing us all, A
alone

686
01:00:30,898 --> 01:00:35,335
Before he died dad wanted to see you

687
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:39,904
Even the day before he passed
away, he was really sad

688
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:46,880
He was so repentant about
not letting you marry my brother

689
01:00:47,714 --> 01:00:50,206
After not doing at the right time,
what is the use of such repentance?

690
01:00:52,386 --> 01:00:54,718
We thought you will come
when your dad passed away

691
01:01:00,093 --> 01:01:01,925

 had decided not to come back here

692
01:01:04,698 --> 01:01:07,292

 am his daughter. 
 will be stubborn too

693
01:01:15,442 --> 01:01:20,039
In short... me, Alnama and Sulnama should
have been born as Suhara aunty's children

694
01:01:39,433 --> 01:01:45,930
Why didn't you marry? Was it because of your
anger for your dad or for the love for our dad?

695
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:56,142
Both

696
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:07,154
Our dad is still very romantic, right mom?

697
01:02:26,213 --> 01:02:26,975
Did you go home?

698
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:30,814
Did you go home?

699
01:02:31,552 --> 01:02:33,111

 came here straight from the airport

700
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:40,320
Shanu told he saw you at Dubai airport

701
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:45,892
But 
 didn't expect you to come here today

702
01:02:49,203 --> 01:02:49,499
Me too

703
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:59,109
I don't know why. 
 felt like
seeing you yesterday evening

704
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:15,028

 forgot to ask you.
What do you want to drink?

705
01:03:15,229 --> 01:03:16,458
Nothing.
-Tea or juice?

706
01:03:17,064 --> 01:03:20,227

 don't want anything.
-Still you came here for the first time

707
01:03:20,568 --> 01:03:22,559
Then, shall 
 bring biryani?

708
01:03:23,604 --> 01:03:25,902
I had food from flight.

 don't need anything

709
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:48,459
Have you ever felt angry at me,
like you had for your dad?

710
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:52,361
No

711
01:03:56,437 --> 01:03:59,202
It was actually not my anger towards
dad that made me go from here

712
01:04:01,575 --> 01:04:03,236
It was the love for you

713
01:04:07,948 --> 01:04:11,213
If you had asked me to come, 
 would have

714
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:24,920
But as we two were to become one, our
families would have been split forever

715
01:04:31,939 --> 01:04:39,939
Though my dad told it as a ridicule, 
 didn't want to be
burden as you were struggling to marry off your sisters

716
01:04:47,688 --> 01:04:49,315

 wanted to take a medicine

717
01:05:04,038 --> 01:05:07,235

 have breathing issues.
This is the medicine for that

718
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:14,377
She doesn't seem to trust us

719
01:05:14,948 --> 01:05:15,642
Not because of that

720
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:25,217
Any woman would be wary if she sees her husband in front
of their bedroom with the lady whom he loved the most

721
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:34,133
Maybe

722
01:05:35,302 --> 01:05:35,996
True

723
01:05:42,176 --> 01:05:43,439
When are you going back?

724
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,413
Suhara...

725
01:05:57,725 --> 01:05:59,022
When are you going back?

726
01:06:00,661 --> 01:06:01,355
Tomorrow

727
01:06:02,663 --> 01:06:03,357
Tomorrow itself

728
01:06:19,246 --> 01:06:20,543
We won't meet again

729
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:23,245
And a comeback

730
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:37,598
Shalll go?
-You have to go tonight itself?

731
01:06:38,098 --> 01:06:41,227

 have to go. 
 had told brother
that 
 will come, while at the airport

732
01:06:42,436 --> 01:06:43,198
Shalll go?

733
01:06:43,704 --> 01:06:45,433
When will we see you again?

734
01:06:46,473 --> 01:06:48,601
Inshallah.. we will see

735
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:53,210
Shalll go?
-This early?

736
01:06:55,282 --> 01:06:55,771
I have to go

737
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:03,013
If you hadn't come, his Haj wouldn't have been
complete

738
01:07:17,304 --> 01:07:18,703
He is lucky

739
01:08:10,524 --> 01:08:12,117
I won

740
01:12:13,768 --> 01:12:14,098
My God

741
01:13:04,018 --> 01:13:07,044
By the side of the window of love

742
01:13:07,755 --> 01:13:11,453
My dove... with feathers of rainbow

743
01:13:13,594 --> 01:13:17,030
Without ever closing my eyes...

744
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:22,764

 waited for you day and night

745
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:27,835
Will 
 ever get enough of ...

746
01:13:28,642 --> 01:13:32,601
the enchanting sweetness

747
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:40,647
The two hearts are flowing as one river

748
01:14:24,465 --> 01:14:27,025
Who is he for you?
-We are in love

749
01:14:42,716 --> 01:14:44,684
{1 will wait for you outside
the house at 11 pm)

750
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:54,626
Is it the wedding string that
blossoms as the golden shower?

751
01:14:55,062 --> 01:14:56,530
One photo please.
They are the witnesses

752
01:14:57,765 --> 01:15:03,863
You dissolve into every
cell of mine as moonlight

753
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:10,844
Won't you spread into the pages of my life?

754
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:18,543
We become one in our
beautiful hut made of dreams

755
01:15:19,787 --> 01:15:24,190
The rays of dawn comes
like the smile of a newborn

756
01:16:08,836 --> 01:16:13,933
My world opens with you... my 'mother bird'

757
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:21,909
You wear the goodness of
your soul in your feathers

758
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:28,648
My life will shine with you without fading ever

759
01:16:30,224 --> 01:16:36,322
You gave me a caring
shade from the sun

760
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:42,629
Shine as a full moon in
my next life too, my beloved

761
01:16:46,874 --> 01:16:48,603
Come here...
-You leave her alone

762
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:52,135
Krishnetta... You are pampering her.
Don't forget. She is a girl

763
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,374
She was a girl too

764
01:16:53,948 --> 01:16:55,916
Then your Indira Gandhi is yet to brush her
teeth

765
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:02,584
Take your umbrella

766
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:05,689
Eat your lunch

767
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:18,166
Krishnetta...

768
01:17:20,307 --> 01:17:22,901
Still asleep?
You know what time it is?

769
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:27,315
Krishnettafifl Get up.
Time to wake up

770
01:17:27,915 --> 01:17:29,178
How many years 
 have been telling you this?

771
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:30,749
It's already late

772
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:32,248
It has been five years since Sreekutty came

773
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:35,412
You get up now.
You don't have to go the workshop today?

774
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:36,923
Go and take bath

775
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:38,189
Sreekutty has left?

776
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:39,085
To the workshop?

777
01:17:39,427 --> 01:17:41,225
No. To the school.
-She just left

778
01:17:41,762 --> 01:17:42,729

 managed somehow to send her

779
01:17:43,097 --> 01:17:44,724
Then let it be a son

780
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,790
Let me check.
-Who has come at this time?

781
01:17:48,936 --> 01:17:50,734
Get up.
-Don't do that

782
01:17:55,943 --> 01:17:57,069
Isn't this Krishnan's house?

783
01:17:58,779 --> 01:17:59,211
Krishnan is there?

784
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,445
He is there inside.
-Call him

785
01:18:04,218 --> 01:18:05,208
Oh... It is you, sir?

786
01:18:06,987 --> 01:18:07,385
What is it, sir?

787
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:09,451
Cl wants to see you

788
01:18:10,191 --> 01:18:11,716
He wants to know something

789
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:13,922
What is it?

790
01:18:14,428 --> 01:18:15,793
That only he knows

791
01:18:16,497 --> 01:18:17,658
You will come only after knowing that?

792
01:18:18,165 --> 01:18:20,395
No. 
 just wanted to know

793
01:18:20,768 --> 01:18:21,462
Nothing serious

794
01:18:22,503 --> 01:18:23,868
Cl wants to ask you something

795
01:18:25,105 --> 01:18:25,936

 am yet to take bath

796
01:18:26,407 --> 01:18:27,169
That is okay

797
01:18:27,942 --> 01:18:30,070
You come there.
When will you come?

798
01:18:30,811 --> 01:18:32,677
I will come at 10.30 ... at 11

799
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,341
Be at sharp 11

800
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:35,972
1will tell sir

801
01:18:36,984 --> 01:18:37,314
Okay

802
01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:42,955
What?

803
01:18:43,524 --> 01:18:46,459

 don't know what it is

804
01:18:52,766 --> 01:18:54,063
It's a shameful affair

805
01:18:55,002 --> 01:18:56,470
Politics and molestation

806
01:18:57,204 --> 01:18:58,399
doesn't go together

807
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:02,205
There was some respect for social work

808
01:19:04,778 --> 01:19:06,303
If you are not ready for a compromise

809
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:08,139
As your leader said earlier

810
01:19:08,849 --> 01:19:10,715
Let law take its course. What do you say?

811
01:19:11,051 --> 01:19:12,485
If you say based on what she says...

812
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,346
Such language should be
limited to your party office

813
01:19:15,389 --> 01:19:16,982
In molestation cases the victim's
statement is the key for police

814
01:19:17,524 --> 01:19:19,856
Okay then. We will see.

815
01:19:24,131 --> 01:19:29,934
After being in the party for so long, if you say
molestation now... those who hear it have to believe

816
01:19:30,804 --> 01:19:33,501
They were cheating me by
saying lies for so many years

817
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:36,300
Those who came even yesterday have
positions

818
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:38,206
lam left out

819
01:19:39,146 --> 01:19:39,772
So that is the reason

820
01:19:40,848 --> 01:19:42,316

 will file FIR and register the case

821
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:48,377
But if you come saying you believe party investigation
more than Indian judiciary, you will know who 
 am

822
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:50,216
Go then.
- Okay sir

823
01:19:57,531 --> 01:19:59,090
Sir,A{ this is Krishnan

824
01:20:06,373 --> 01:20:07,363
You have a big moustache

825
01:20:10,077 --> 01:20:11,545
Bring two cups of tea

826
01:20:15,249 --> 01:20:16,774
Now 
 will come to the matter

827
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:20,385
Two were caught during night patrol

828
01:20:21,388 --> 01:20:22,514
When they were questioned...

829
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:24,357
They were back from a mission

830
01:20:26,227 --> 01:20:29,891
They had robbed enough to feed
themselves for the rest of their lives

831
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:33,963
They could have been left as normal robbers

832
01:20:35,135 --> 01:20:36,967
My wife and children's luck...

833
01:20:37,538 --> 01:20:41,236
It is a chance to win a medal that they brought

834
01:20:41,842 --> 01:20:44,311
Why are you saying all this to me?

835
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:45,843
We policemen...

836
01:20:46,213 --> 01:20:47,078
would give our heart out

837
01:20:47,381 --> 01:20:49,349
if we get the correct answers to our questions

838
01:20:50,284 --> 01:20:51,274
Or else rip the heart out

839
01:20:51,952 --> 01:20:52,418
So 
 was saying

840
01:20:53,454 --> 01:20:55,047
In one of their stories...

841
01:20:55,522 --> 01:20:56,318
your name was there too

842
01:20:57,257 --> 01:20:59,055
Sir,Af Me...

843
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:00,386
You don't have to be scared

844
01:21:01,662 --> 01:21:03,596
When they said so 
 thought of asking you

845
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:04,960
They are robbers

846
01:21:05,499 --> 01:21:08,264
It is for the police to enquire
if it is right or wrong... right?

847
01:21:10,671 --> 01:21:13,231
This story happened twenty years back

848
01:21:14,975 --> 01:21:16,204
You try to remember after drinking this

849
01:21:16,577 --> 01:21:18,409

 don't want sir...
-That is okay

850
01:21:20,114 --> 01:21:23,243
What we were saying was...
robbery... you remember now?

851
01:21:29,523 --> 01:21:30,888
You don't remember?
-No

852
01:21:31,425 --> 01:21:32,153
Then 
 will explain

853
01:21:33,394 --> 01:21:34,452
Twenty years back

854
01:21:35,029 --> 01:21:36,292
From Thuthiyoor Federal Bank

855
01:21:36,997 --> 01:21:40,228
a medium level businessman named Rajeevan,
who came out after withdrawing money

856
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:42,896
Aged around 45

857
01:21:44,438 --> 01:21:45,200
Charlie

858
01:21:48,509 --> 01:21:49,135
Raju

859
01:21:51,212 --> 01:21:51,644
Krishnan

860
01:21:53,581 --> 01:21:54,548
The trio

861
01:21:56,483 --> 01:21:57,951
After beating up Rajeev

862
01:21:58,686 --> 01:22:05,183
They flee with that 4 lakhs... 4 lakhs then
would be around 40 lakhs now

863
01:22:06,193 --> 01:22:06,989
Now you remember?

864
01:22:12,466 --> 01:22:15,231
See... now he remembers everything

865
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,069
This is the merit of policemen

866
01:22:18,572 --> 01:22:21,007
If you ask the way it needs to be
everything will come to mind

867
01:22:22,176 --> 01:22:22,642
Now tell me

868
01:22:24,645 --> 01:22:26,010
It was not deliberate, sir

869
01:22:26,547 --> 01:22:29,107
They got me into a trap

870
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:29,977
That they said...

871
01:22:30,384 --> 01:22:31,374
They called you

872
01:22:32,186 --> 01:22:34,314
But there are some tricky rules in our law

873
01:22:34,522 --> 01:22:36,422
Have you heard about IPC 347

874
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:40,389
Those who got involved in a crime by
any means is also a convict

875
01:22:41,261 --> 01:22:42,126
So you are also a convict

876
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:45,097
Sir... Me...

877
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:47,195
You have anyone to call?

878
01:22:48,002 --> 01:22:49,993
Anyway you will be remanded
-Don't ruin me, sir

879
01:22:50,437 --> 01:22:52,371
This case was lying there
without any clues for 20 years

880
01:22:53,274 --> 01:22:54,708
Now we have found the evidences... and found
proved it

881
01:22:55,643 --> 01:22:57,338
Only then will people identify us as well

882
01:22:58,145 --> 01:22:59,203
Save me sir

883
01:22:59,747 --> 01:23:01,511
Sentiments have no value now

884
01:23:02,383 --> 01:23:04,249
Sukumaran... take him to the cell

885
01:23:04,685 --> 01:23:06,653
Sir... please save me

886
01:23:07,621 --> 01:23:08,520
It just happened sir

887
01:23:09,423 --> 01:23:12,051
If you enquire, you will know

 never make any trouble

888
01:23:12,426 --> 01:23:15,327
My daughter and my wife,A{]
they have no one else

889
01:23:19,767 --> 01:23:21,394
You know me, sir

890
01:23:22,036 --> 01:23:23,265
You give me your phone

891
01:23:23,737 --> 01:23:24,966
Sir please explain to him

892
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,571
You can go out in two days

893
01:23:28,108 --> 01:23:29,769
Two days? Don't say like that sir

894
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:45,258
We were helpless

895
01:23:48,729 --> 01:23:50,424
You cheated me, right?

896
01:23:52,032 --> 01:23:53,761
All these years 
 stayed away from you

897
01:23:54,401 --> 01:23:56,563
As 
 was scared if 
 will be caught someday

898
01:23:58,439 --> 01:24:00,703
We tried not to tell your name

899
01:24:01,609 --> 01:24:02,804
They thrashed us so hard

900
01:24:05,412 --> 01:24:06,777
We had decided to stop everything

901
01:24:07,848 --> 01:24:10,613
We went for the last game before ending
everything

902
01:24:12,286 --> 01:24:13,082
It ended this way

903
01:24:13,787 --> 01:24:14,652
Everything is gone

904
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:17,653
Becuase of us,Af even you...

905
01:24:18,859 --> 01:24:21,260
You guys knew everything

906
01:24:24,265 --> 01:24:25,255
My Sreekutty

907
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:27,392
My Sreeja

908
01:24:28,536 --> 01:24:30,527
They have only me

909
01:24:32,539 --> 01:24:35,099
Why did you do this to me?

910
01:24:37,578 --> 01:24:38,511
His sorry...

911
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:42,342
After ruining my life...

912
01:24:48,155 --> 01:24:49,418
Sir,Af save us...

913
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:52,817
What is happening there?

914
01:24:55,296 --> 01:24:57,765
Leave him... Move aside

915
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:00,128
Take your tricks at home

916
01:25:39,173 --> 01:25:41,574
You are not coming inside?
-No

917
01:25:45,913 --> 01:25:47,244
Krishna... here is you Aadhar card and mobile

918
01:25:47,715 --> 01:25:49,877
Sreeja was so upset when 
 came to collect this
yesterday

919
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:54,447
You call me if anything is needed

920
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:23,781
You keep quiet

921
01:26:27,888 --> 01:26:29,413
Come here.
-Don't touch her

922
01:26:29,924 --> 01:26:31,653
Sreeja.
-Don't call me so hereafter

923
01:26:32,593 --> 01:26:33,719
Believe me

924
01:26:34,628 --> 01:26:36,824

 swear on Sreekutty...
It was not done intentionally

925
01:26:37,298 --> 01:26:40,529
For a sin that happened so long ago...
-Why did you tell me this until now?

926
01:26:41,268 --> 01:26:43,293
What all would you have hidden from me like
this?

927
01:26:44,471 --> 01:26:45,302
You are a cheat

928
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,469
If you loved me a bit

929
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:52,577

 left my parents and family to be with you

930
01:26:53,848 --> 01:26:54,713
And to me...

931
01:26:57,618 --> 01:27:00,986
You know,Af Me and my daughter have not
gone out for the past two days

932
01:27:02,456 --> 01:27:04,686
Who am 
 now? A robber's wife

933
01:27:06,327 --> 01:27:06,953
Enough

934
01:27:08,295 --> 01:27:09,558
Our relationship ends here

935
01:27:10,598 --> 01:27:14,228

 waited until now to say this on your face

936
01:27:14,502 --> 01:27:14,968
Come here

937
01:27:15,703 --> 01:27:17,364
Sreeja, listen to me.
-Don't touch me

938
01:27:18,439 --> 01:27:21,272
Leave me, Mom.
My hand aches

939
01:27:21,642 --> 01:27:24,009
Mom, leave me. Dad...

940
01:27:25,346 --> 01:27:26,677
Don't worry

941
01:27:31,051 --> 01:27:32,541
<i>Sreckutty, come here.
â€œwon't</i>

942
01:27:33,854 --> 01:27:37,688
Come here.
-Leave the kid

943
01:27:38,492 --> 01:27:41,985
Itold you to spare the kid

944
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:50,862
You can go if you want

945
01:27:51,839 --> 01:27:52,863

 won't leave my daughter

946
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:56,404
Sreekuttyfifl come with Mom

947
01:27:57,344 --> 01:27:58,834
No,Af] 
 won't come, leaving my dad

948
01:28:00,514 --> 01:28:01,640
Then think your mom is dead

949
01:28:04,085 --> 01:28:06,611
Your fate is to live as a robber's daughter

950
01:28:26,106 --> 01:28:28,473
(Three convicted for two and a half years for
robbery)

951
01:28:28,876 --> 01:28:31,402
{Nine months later)

952
01:28:32,112 --> 01:28:35,514
{Central Jail, Viyyoor)

953
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:00,006
Sign here

954
01:29:03,711 --> 01:29:06,009
It seems you have big connections
with the Bishop's house

955
01:29:07,481 --> 01:29:08,744
See how times have changed

956
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:12,484
Bishop is there for robbers
to recommend for parole

957
01:29:14,755 --> 01:29:17,554

 would get it without any
recommendation in this stage, sir

958
01:29:18,025 --> 01:29:18,719
Enough

959
01:29:19,159 --> 01:29:21,594
Report back on Monday morning before 10

960
01:29:21,962 --> 01:29:22,895
Understood?
-Okay, sir

961
01:29:27,501 --> 01:29:29,094
Do you any other plans?

962
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,607
Go now

963
01:31:54,615 --> 01:31:56,879
Please come.
Mother did tell you will come today

964
01:31:57,818 --> 01:31:58,250
My daughter...

965
01:31:58,686 --> 01:31:59,244
Nothing to worry

966
01:31:59,787 --> 01:32:00,583
Mother will explain everything

967
01:32:01,155 --> 01:32:01,621
Please come

968
01:32:27,648 --> 01:32:29,309
Come inside, Krishna...

969
01:32:32,887 --> 01:32:35,151
Things are going out of our hands

970
01:32:35,956 --> 01:32:37,981
We did all that we could

971
01:32:39,927 --> 01:32:45,297
There is nothing that God Almighty can't do

972
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:47,029
Let's pray

973
01:32:48,202 --> 01:32:50,864

 have only my daughter to call myself

974
01:32:52,339 --> 01:32:54,307
Why is God testing us like this?

975
01:32:55,376 --> 01:32:56,707
Don't be sad, Krishna

976
01:32:57,244 --> 01:32:59,042
There will be a solution for everything

977
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:04,641
Dr. Sheela is treating your daughter

978
01:33:05,352 --> 01:33:07,343
Sheela grew up in this convent

979
01:33:08,189 --> 01:33:12,148
She is Kerala's best cardiac surgeon now

980
01:33:13,761 --> 01:33:16,196
She takes care of Sreekutty
like her own daughter

981
01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:20,292
So you don't have to worry
about your daughter

982
01:33:20,834 --> 01:33:23,269
All our prayers are also there

983
01:33:24,705 --> 01:33:25,729
Thank you Mother

984
01:33:26,107 --> 01:33:30,203
Thank God. He will do miracles

985
01:33:30,911 --> 01:33:31,878
I will tell Sheela

986
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,045
You go to the hospital

987
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:37,376
Okay

988
01:33:43,724 --> 01:33:44,589
Mother

989
01:33:47,294 --> 01:33:48,693
The complaint is in the second valve

990
01:33:49,897 --> 01:33:50,728
Doctor,Af my kid

991
01:33:51,298 --> 01:33:53,699
Sreekutty was admitted at the right time

992
01:33:54,235 --> 01:33:57,330
If two days had gone things
would have been out of control

993
01:34:00,808 --> 01:34:03,300

 have no one else to call as my own

994
01:34:04,311 --> 01:34:05,608

 am living for her

995
01:34:09,083 --> 01:34:13,350
My daughter had to stay in the orphanage
though all are there for her

996
01:34:15,289 --> 01:34:19,954
She has suffered for me
so much at this young age

997
01:34:21,796 --> 01:34:22,922
Finally now

998
01:34:24,932 --> 01:34:26,366
This is not the time to cry, Krishnan

999
01:34:27,268 --> 01:34:30,329
We don't have much time to save her

1000
01:34:33,107 --> 01:34:35,303
Maximum is 48 hours

1001
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:40,772

 had told Mother

1002
01:34:41,315 --> 01:34:48,187
If we had more time we could have collected
some funds by publishing the news in the media

1003
01:34:48,822 --> 01:34:50,449
Now there is no time for that

1004
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:53,649
Even otherwise that is not required doctor

1005
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:57,889
For media to create news to celebrate

1006
01:34:59,133 --> 01:35:01,932
My daughter's life too...

1007
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:03,732
That is not needed

1008
01:35:04,405 --> 01:35:06,669
The operation will cost 18 lakhs

1009
01:35:15,816 --> 01:35:17,944
How can you manage in this stage?

1010
01:35:21,956 --> 01:35:25,893

 am indebted to the orphanage and to the
Mother superior

1011
01:35:26,894 --> 01:35:32,731
As per Mother's request if 
 talk to the
hospital management, 8 lakhs can be waived

1012
01:35:34,168 --> 01:35:36,899
But even then 10 lakhs is required

1013
01:35:42,843 --> 01:35:45,869
The son of the patient in CCU
has come to see you, doctor

1014
01:35:46,513 --> 01:35:47,947
Ask him to come.
-Okay doctor

1015
01:35:48,449 --> 01:35:49,883
Did you see your daughter, Krishnan?

1016
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:50,815
No

1017
01:35:51,218 --> 01:35:53,186
1 will call ICU. You go there

1018
01:35:58,058 --> 01:36:00,356
God is great, Krishnan. Let us pray

1019
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,812
Who?
-1 am Krishnan

1020
01:36:22,182 --> 01:36:24,879
Sreekutty's dad. The doctor told me...
-Come inside

1021
01:36:25,819 --> 01:36:27,344
Keep the sandals outside

1022
01:37:52,273 --> 01:37:52,899
Daughter

1023
01:38:01,115 --> 01:38:02,981
Don't call her.
She is under sedation

1024
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:04,976
It will take one to two hours

1025
01:38:27,308 --> 01:38:28,639
Mother had told us. When did you come?

1026
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:29,970
A little while ago

1027
01:38:30,477 --> 01:38:32,445

 met the doctor. And my daughter too.

1028
01:38:33,681 --> 01:38:35,979
How would 
 thank you for
the love that you are showing

1029
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:36,942
Don't be sad

1030
01:38:37,451 --> 01:38:40,148
God will take care.
She is such a good kid

1031
01:38:43,357 --> 01:38:46,327
Krishna, don't feel bad

1032
01:38:46,694 --> 01:38:49,664
At this juncture, Sreekutty needs
her mother's love and care

1033
01:38:52,566 --> 01:38:54,933
You are staying apart.
Yet to be separated.

1034
01:39:24,531 --> 01:39:25,362
Have this

1035
01:39:28,369 --> 01:39:31,202
There is only one coat.
So 
 am taking care of it like my kid

1036
01:39:33,074 --> 01:39:34,200
It is without sugar

1037
01:39:35,243 --> 01:39:36,733
Sugar is over

1038
01:39:39,447 --> 01:39:44,385
In the morning 
 will go to the court with the
coat. By noon 
 will be back doing nothing much.

1039
01:39:45,386 --> 01:39:48,356
To give the rent there is mother's pension

1040
01:39:49,423 --> 01:39:52,222
Mother... save me!

1041
01:39:52,793 --> 01:39:55,023

 was praying for my mother's good health

1042
01:39:57,064 --> 01:39:59,658
As 
 am unmarried there are no expenses

1043
01:40:01,435 --> 01:40:03,062
It's not that 
 don't know your situation

1044
01:40:04,438 --> 01:40:07,772
But... there is no one else to help me in this
state

1045
01:40:08,442 --> 01:40:10,706

 don't ask for any money

1046
01:40:12,012 --> 01:40:16,279
You know all 
 have is that
house and the ten cents

1047
01:40:17,418 --> 01:40:22,219
Then bring the document.
Any money lender will give you 10 lakhs

1048
01:40:23,457 --> 01:40:26,518
It has been pledged in the bank

1049
01:40:26,727 --> 01:40:29,196
It was taken to start the workshop

1050
01:40:31,799 --> 01:40:35,099
You can try to take the document from the
bank...

1051
01:40:35,536 --> 01:40:36,765
Can't you help me?

1052
01:40:37,404 --> 01:40:39,099
What are you saying?

1053
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:43,540
If it was a co-operative bank we could have
tried

1054
01:40:44,478 --> 01:40:47,140
Nationalised banks have no human emotions or
sympathy

1055
01:40:47,681 --> 01:40:49,581
It is for corporates to loot

1056
01:40:50,651 --> 01:40:53,018
Even if they agree there are so much
procedures

1057
01:40:53,454 --> 01:40:55,013
When will you get money after all this?

1058
01:40:56,056 --> 01:40:57,182
You want it today or tomorrow, right?

1059
01:41:02,263 --> 01:41:04,288
Who is there with the kid at the hospital?

1060
01:41:06,167 --> 01:41:08,329
The sisters from the orphanage

1061
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:10,504
Haven't you informed Sreeja?

1062
01:41:12,272 --> 01:41:12,761
No

1063
01:41:14,608 --> 01:41:17,771
You have to. A nun won't replace own mother

1064
01:41:18,579 --> 01:41:21,241
There should be someone to take care of the
kid to look after you go post parole period

1065
01:41:33,461 --> 01:41:34,121
There is one way

1066
01:41:37,131 --> 01:41:38,360
This is the only way

1067
01:41:41,135 --> 01:41:45,265
To end your marital issues and
for the operation to happen

1068
01:41:45,873 --> 01:41:46,806
A single option

1069
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:49,532
What do you mean?

1070
01:41:52,246 --> 01:41:53,543
You go and see Sreeja

1071
01:41:55,716 --> 01:41:58,242
There is no mother who won't be convinced
if her daughter is in this state

1072
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:00,448
Then about the money

1073
01:42:01,222 --> 01:42:04,852
Your father in law who lends money for
hefty interest will have the amount

1074
01:42:05,659 --> 01:42:08,526
It is not possible for anyone else to
make 10 lakhs so easily at this time

1075
01:42:10,264 --> 01:42:16,692
It can be the willingness to help a friend or a
lawyer's other than normal way to solve this

1076
01:42:17,505 --> 01:42:19,530
But... this is the only way

1077
01:42:21,208 --> 01:42:23,472
You go... it is for the child, isn't it?

1078
01:42:30,251 --> 01:42:34,415
Keep the flower there... over there

1079
01:42:35,589 --> 01:42:37,353
In which language will 
 talk to these guys?

1080
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:45,162
Jayetta... here is tea for you

1081
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,430
Guys... you want tea?

1082
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:51,404
Clean there

1083
01:42:56,777 --> 01:42:58,643
Where are you up to?

1084
01:42:59,313 --> 01:43:00,872
It's to you. Stop there

1085
01:43:02,216 --> 01:43:03,377

 want to see Sreeja

1086
01:43:03,584 --> 01:43:04,210
Which Sreeja?

1087
01:43:04,752 --> 01:43:05,548
Who is she for you?

1088
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:07,410
Did you hear?

1089
01:43:07,922 --> 01:43:09,720
You shouldn't enter here. Get out now

1090
01:43:10,257 --> 01:43:11,554
What is your plan?

1091
01:43:12,627 --> 01:43:13,856

 want to see my wife

1092
01:43:15,295 --> 01:43:16,285
His wife!

1093
01:43:16,664 --> 01:43:20,362
To you who ruined her life

1094
01:43:20,767 --> 01:43:22,531

 should bring her back to you? Get out now

1095
01:43:24,638 --> 01:43:26,436

 don't have anything to tell you

1096
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,434
Then to whom do you
want to talk to in this house?

1097
01:43:30,478 --> 01:43:32,310
Stop staring and call the police

1098
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,178
Who knows he came after a jail break?

1099
01:43:35,783 --> 01:43:36,306
Go away

1100
01:43:42,556 --> 01:43:45,856
You stand there.
-As if she will come if you call her

1101
01:43:47,761 --> 01:43:48,819

 came to see you

1102
01:43:49,697 --> 01:43:52,428
You keep waiting. She is our daughter

1103
01:44:11,519 --> 01:44:12,543

 came out on parole

1104
01:44:13,854 --> 01:44:15,481
You should show the
mind to listen what 
 say

1105
01:44:15,723 --> 01:44:16,383
No

1106
01:44:16,924 --> 01:44:19,552
I 'am in this stage as 
 listened to you

1107
01:44:20,928 --> 01:44:21,656
Not anymore

1108
01:44:22,396 --> 01:44:24,296
Sreeja, please...
- don't want to hear anything

1109
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,890

 have nothing to tell you as well

1110
01:44:26,534 --> 01:44:28,832
Now my parents are there to take care of me

1111
01:44:29,837 --> 01:44:30,497
That is enough

1112
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:32,872
That is all 
 want

1113
01:44:37,378 --> 01:44:38,675
Our daughter is in the hospital

1114
01:44:39,046 --> 01:44:40,480
She needs an operation

1115
01:44:41,749 --> 01:44:43,376
He has come with a new lie

1116
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:44,310
Liar

1117
01:44:44,918 --> 01:44:45,976
It's not a lie, Sreeja

1118
01:44:46,754 --> 01:44:48,620
Her operation requires 10 lakhs

1119
01:44:49,023 --> 01:44:50,548
You know how to make money

1120
01:44:50,924 --> 01:44:52,483
Robbery. Go and rob

1121
01:44:54,728 --> 01:44:57,390

 am trying to make a
new life for my daughter

1122
01:44:57,898 --> 01:44:59,525
You should not be seen here again

1123
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:01,561
What are you waiting for?
Throw him out

1124
01:45:02,503 --> 01:45:03,698
Throw him out

1125
01:45:24,859 --> 01:45:28,420
How fast lives change for some

1126
01:45:28,996 --> 01:45:30,589
He had gone with some friends just like that

1127
01:45:31,131 --> 01:45:32,394
Became a thief

1128
01:45:32,766 --> 01:45:33,597
a robber

1129
01:45:34,134 --> 01:45:37,798
eventually wife, family
and life itself is ruined

1130
01:45:38,606 --> 01:45:42,907
Now to save daughter's life
risked his own life

1131
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:45,602
In the same ICU with his daughter

1132
01:45:47,148 --> 01:45:49,446
What a tragedy his life is

1133
01:45:52,987 --> 01:45:56,548

 had called you saying

 can't come in the evening

1134
01:45:58,025 --> 01:45:59,493
Then he was right in front of me

1135
01:45:59,894 --> 01:46:00,656
No

1136
01:46:02,029 --> 01:46:04,327
One of my patients is a bit serious here

1137
01:46:05,366 --> 01:46:06,424
A surgery is needed

1138
01:46:08,135 --> 01:46:10,126
So 
 can't stay away

1139
01:46:12,874 --> 01:46:14,706
Have you bought all the
medicines that 
 prescribed?

1140
01:46:15,075 --> 01:46:17,476

 have packed all those medicines separately

1141
01:46:18,145 --> 01:46:20,910
Packing is not enough.
You should have it too.

1142
01:46:21,482 --> 01:46:23,143
I will have them for sure

1143
01:46:23,918 --> 01:46:25,147
You should pray for us all

1144
01:46:34,962 --> 01:46:38,694
Krishna... the child's situation is really bad

1145
01:46:41,702 --> 01:46:44,137

 called you urgently to inform this

1146
01:46:47,908 --> 01:46:53,904
If the surgery is not done
tonight or tomorrow morning...

1147
01:46:58,686 --> 01:47:01,155
There is no use in crying or becoming sad

1148
01:47:02,189 --> 01:47:03,486
You should know the reality

1149
01:47:08,929 --> 01:47:12,456
If surgery is not done before 11 am tomorrow

1150
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:13,759
as a doctor

1151
01:47:15,669 --> 01:47:16,761
I am helpless

1152
01:47:31,685 --> 01:47:33,210
fix the operation, doctor

1153
01:47:34,688 --> 01:47:36,019
If 1 am alive

1154
01:47:37,891 --> 01:47:40,622

 will remit the money before 10 am tomorrow

1155
01:48:09,790 --> 01:48:11,554
Where is the ICU?

1156
01:48:11,759 --> 01:48:12,920
This way,Af[ first floor

1157
01:48:16,797 --> 01:48:18,697
I didn't think police will come this fast

1158
01:48:21,101 --> 01:48:23,069

 was about to call you, Appu

1159
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:23,896
How did you know?

1160
01:48:24,171 --> 01:48:25,138
Mother called me

1161
01:48:25,906 --> 01:48:27,533
This is Krishnan's friend, Appu

1162
01:48:28,308 --> 01:48:31,608
How is he now?
-Can't say anything now. 
 will be back

1163
01:48:36,951 --> 01:48:40,478
It would have been around 12.30. Still was
unconscious

1164
01:48:43,891 --> 01:48:44,756
How is his situation?

1165
01:48:45,792 --> 01:48:48,022
The injury is pretty complicated

1166
01:48:48,763 --> 01:48:49,730
It happened when he
fell down and hit his head

1167
01:48:50,531 --> 01:48:51,930
There is an injury in the forehead as well

1168
01:48:52,633 --> 01:48:54,499
Could have happened on hitting the door

1169
01:48:55,102 --> 01:48:57,070
He should have become unconscious with the
fall

1170
01:48:58,072 --> 01:48:59,597
Will he go into a coma?

1171
01:48:59,807 --> 01:49:02,071
Can't say. It will take some hours to say that

1172
01:49:03,944 --> 01:49:05,275
What about the owners of the
house where he went to rob?

1173
01:49:05,813 --> 01:49:08,214
He is there outside.
He was about to go for Haj tomorrow

1174
01:49:08,783 --> 01:49:09,614
It was then

1175
01:49:16,290 --> 01:49:17,951
That you may call me and inform

1176
01:49:25,966 --> 01:49:28,264
This is Muhammed. It was in his house...

1177
01:49:29,803 --> 01:49:31,293
Tell me Mr. Muhammed. What happened there?

1178
01:49:34,876 --> 01:49:37,709
I had a dream and got up from sleep

1179
01:49:38,012 --> 01:49:39,309
It was raining heavily

1180
01:49:39,847 --> 01:49:40,643
The power was gone

1181
01:49:41,048 --> 01:49:42,777
The inverter at home was faulty

1182
01:49:43,183 --> 01:49:46,676
The torch is kept below at the
dining room, above the fridge

1183
01:49:47,788 --> 01:49:51,622
When 
 went out of the room to get the torch...

1184
01:49:51,992 --> 01:49:53,721
The door of another bedroom was open

1185
01:49:54,095 --> 01:49:55,119

 got inside and checked

1186
01:49:55,663 --> 01:49:57,188
Suddenly the door of the bedroom closed

1187
01:49:58,065 --> 01:49:59,328
When 
 opened the door
there was someone

1188
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:01,727
1 got scared and closed the door

1189
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:05,161
When 
 didn't hear anything after a while...

1190
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:07,601

 came down

1191
01:50:08,209 --> 01:50:09,608
and lighted the torch

1192
01:50:10,177 --> 01:50:12,646

 saw a person lying there in a pool of blood

1193
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:15,615
Was he lying facing up or down?
- Facing up

1194
01:50:17,051 --> 01:50:17,711
Who are you?

1195
01:50:19,186 --> 01:50:21,018
My son in law. Daughter's husband

1196
01:50:21,689 --> 01:50:22,884
1 will ask. You need to say only then

1197
01:50:25,092 --> 01:50:25,957
What you said is right

1198
01:50:26,928 --> 01:50:31,195
When the door closed, he lost
control and fell upside down

1199
01:50:32,066 --> 01:50:34,660
The robber lying inside is
not very experienced

1200
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:38,935
When are you going for Haj?

1201
01:50:39,673 --> 01:50:41,038
The flight is at noon 1.30

1202
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:43,277
Don't cancel your trip

1203
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:49,082
You manhandled the
robber who broke inside

1204
01:50:50,150 --> 01:50:54,018
Self protection. Even if he dies
the case against you will not stand

1205
01:50:55,056 --> 01:50:55,750
It is private defence

1206
01:50:56,824 --> 01:50:58,019
You go for Haj without fear

1207
01:50:59,927 --> 01:51:04,125
Doctor, we can go home
after completing the formalities

1208
01:51:04,798 --> 01:51:05,060
Come

1209
01:51:11,472 --> 01:51:14,373

 have to tell you something

1210
01:51:16,110 --> 01:51:17,373
It is personal

1211
01:51:21,415 --> 01:51:23,884
Don't say 'no'
- You say it doctor

1212
01:51:24,418 --> 01:51:26,352
Don't register the case immediately

1213
01:51:27,088 --> 01:51:28,681
That's all? Why?

1214
01:51:29,256 --> 01:51:31,725
Krishnan's daughter is there in the ICU

1215
01:51:32,126 --> 01:51:33,753
She has surgery tomorrow

1216
01:51:34,962 --> 01:51:37,954
He did this to make money for the surgery

1217
01:51:38,899 --> 01:51:40,367
Let him become conscious

1218
01:51:40,968 --> 01:51:43,130
Until then please extend the case

1219
01:51:43,904 --> 01:51:45,167
Maximum 2 or 3 hours

1220
01:51:46,374 --> 01:51:49,469
<i>But will this Muhammed agree?
-1 will make him agree</i>

1221
01:51:50,211 --> 01:51:51,144
Then it is okay

1222
01:51:53,948 --> 01:51:55,245
One more thing, sir

1223
01:51:57,084 --> 01:51:58,882

 could have hidden this

1224
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:00,945
But that is not right

1225
01:52:04,825 --> 01:52:07,795
Krishnan is a convict out on parole

1226
01:52:08,329 --> 01:52:09,228
What are you saying, doctor?

1227
01:52:10,064 --> 01:52:11,293
You should have said this earlier

1228
01:52:12,366 --> 01:52:15,165
You know what is the charge if a
convict out on parole does a crime?

1229
01:52:15,502 --> 01:52:16,970
He won't see the world outside

1230
01:52:17,438 --> 01:52:19,338
If he die tomorrow, 
 will lose my job

1231
01:52:20,341 --> 01:52:20,967
It is such a mess

1232
01:52:22,176 --> 01:52:24,770
Sir, only three hours,A{] please

1233
01:52:25,412 --> 01:52:29,076
But one thing. Whatever happens in
between, 
 will register the FIR

1234
01:52:29,917 --> 01:52:31,180
Still you went a bit too far, doctor

1235
01:52:32,386 --> 01:52:33,979
Lost my peace,Afj and sleep too

1236
01:53:00,147 --> 01:53:00,807
It's really late

1237
01:53:01,515 --> 01:53:02,380
You may please go home

1238
01:53:03,184 --> 01:53:04,208
We will take care of the things here

1239
01:53:05,919 --> 01:53:07,114
Why do you lose your sleep like this?

1240
01:53:07,922 --> 01:53:08,889
You have to travel

1241
01:53:11,392 --> 01:53:12,917
What are you thinking about?

1242
01:53:13,928 --> 01:53:15,020
Didn't you hear what the SI said?

1243
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:25,100
That 
 did for self protection.
Even if he dies, 
 won't be in trouble, right?

1244
01:53:29,009 --> 01:53:30,204
Who are we trying to cheat?

1245
01:53:31,012 --> 01:53:31,774
The Lord?

1246
01:53:48,829 --> 01:53:49,796
You come here, son

1247
01:53:54,101 --> 01:53:56,297
Have you seen Krishnan's
daughter who is in the ICU?

1248
01:53:57,571 --> 01:53:59,061
She is only of our Ummukulsu's age

1249
01:54:00,408 --> 01:54:03,503
If the operation scheduled for
tomorrow morning doesn't happen

1250
01:54:04,578 --> 01:54:06,239
Then that kid will not
be there in this world

1251
01:54:08,949 --> 01:54:13,386
You think about the plight of a father who
is out to rob to save his daughter's life

1252
01:54:14,922 --> 01:54:16,583
If it happened to any of us?

1253
01:54:18,158 --> 01:54:20,354
What do you mean?

1254
01:54:21,629 --> 01:54:26,829
If someone comes to our home for any
help during Ramadan what will we do?

1255
01:54:27,668 --> 01:54:29,397
We will do what we can...

1256
01:54:29,636 --> 01:54:32,230
Is it like giving zakat?
It is too much money

1257
01:54:33,674 --> 01:54:35,540
When did the money come?

1258
01:54:36,644 --> 01:54:40,137
There was a time when
I had no money or anything

1259
01:54:41,282 --> 01:54:44,217
When we wanted to have enough
meal at least once in a day

1260
01:54:46,988 --> 01:54:49,548
The day when 
 passed from seven to eighth
class

1261
01:54:51,325 --> 01:54:53,191
The day when 
 passed in the school exam

1262
01:54:53,994 --> 01:54:55,291

 failed in my life

1263
01:54:57,298 --> 01:55:01,098
When 
 ran home to tell that 
 passed

1264
01:55:02,503 --> 01:55:04,631

 saw my dad who was struggling to breathe

1265
01:55:05,706 --> 01:55:08,175
My mom who was crying and rubbing his chest

1266
01:55:09,476 --> 01:55:15,142
And two sisters who were 8 and 5...
not knowing what to do

1267
01:55:18,185 --> 01:55:20,381
Before he died, dad didn't tell me anything

1268
01:55:22,523 --> 01:55:25,049
But before taking the last drop of water...

1269
01:55:26,126 --> 01:55:27,116
he held my hand

1270
01:55:27,694 --> 01:55:30,061
Dad looked at me and my sisters

1271
01:55:32,266 --> 01:55:35,634
Until someone closed his eyes forever

1272
01:55:36,703 --> 01:55:38,398
He was looking at me

1273
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:43,008
That day what he tried to say...

1274
01:55:43,477 --> 01:55:44,410
Is still there in my mind

1275
01:55:46,647 --> 01:55:51,380
There was a three cell torch that he used to
carry while going to check the shrimp farm

1276
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:54,149
That was the only wealth

1277
01:55:55,456 --> 01:55:59,188
At the age of twelve 
 went out with that torch

1278
01:56:00,394 --> 01:56:02,362
The whole night 
 would work at the shrimp
farm

1279
01:56:03,097 --> 01:56:05,327
After coming back, 
 will go straight to school

1280
01:56:06,434 --> 01:56:11,338

 have the mark which 

got for sleeping in the class

1281
01:56:14,375 --> 01:56:15,069
The teacher didn't know it

1282
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:20,745
Not just the teacher. 
 haven't let anyone
know about the misery and poverty

1283
01:56:22,382 --> 01:56:24,350
Until I stopped schooling in class VI

1284
01:56:28,422 --> 01:56:29,685

 started from there, son

1285
01:56:30,257 --> 01:56:31,486
From a big zero

1286
01:56:32,359 --> 01:56:37,627

 have reached here after sheer toil and hard
work

1287
01:56:38,666 --> 01:56:42,603

 have received zakat from many with both
these hands

1288
01:56:44,071 --> 01:56:48,030
The wealth that we have now is
not what 
 made... It was given by God

1289
01:56:49,043 --> 01:56:52,980
A man can't make money even if he try... God
should give it

1290
01:56:55,449 --> 01:56:59,352
God decides who or what we become

1291
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:02,214
That calculation will never go wrong

1292
01:57:03,123 --> 01:57:09,756
Or else why should this Krishnan come to
our house in the night when 
 go for Haj?

1293
01:57:10,798 --> 01:57:15,793
Why should we know about the problems of a
person about whom we don't know until then?

1294
01:57:16,670 --> 01:57:17,762
That is God's decision

1295
01:57:21,142 --> 01:57:26,103
You know what is the greatest deed
in the life of a real Muslim?

1296
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:27,442
Zakat

1297
01:57:28,615 --> 01:57:33,644
The Holy Quran says a person should give
one portion of their assets as zakat

1298
01:57:34,555 --> 01:57:38,822
When 
 wrote assets in the names of
children and in laws, 
 forgot that

1299
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:40,686
This reminded me

1300
01:57:42,396 --> 01:57:44,125
Now let me tell you my decision?

1301
01:57:49,169 --> 01:57:52,264
We will take care of Krishnan's daughter's
operation

1302
01:57:54,875 --> 01:57:57,810
Until this moment this was a bad night for me

1303
01:57:58,612 --> 01:57:59,238
But now

1304
01:58:00,314 --> 01:58:02,646
Like the 27th night of the Ramadan month

1305
01:58:03,384 --> 01:58:04,442
This is the blessed

1306
01:58:04,819 --> 01:58:05,843
Laylat al-Qadr

1307
01:58:06,654 --> 01:58:07,644
The Blessed Night

1308
01:58:09,323 --> 01:58:10,415
This is not my zakat

1309
01:58:11,258 --> 01:58:12,419
This is God's zakat

1310
01:58:14,728 --> 01:58:18,164
There is no bigger Haj than this

1311
01:58:18,833 --> 01:58:26,833
The night when angels descend on earth

1312
01:58:35,583 --> 01:58:43,583
The night when the blessing moonlight
showers

1313
01:58:52,299 --> 01:58:57,294
The blessed night of Laylat al-Qadr

1314
01:59:11,719 --> 01:59:15,849
God, the life, the earth
and the wealth are your zakat

1315
01:59:16,891 --> 01:59:20,759
All are equal and there is no difference
between the big and the small

1316
01:59:22,329 --> 01:59:30,329
When the book of life is counted by God there is
nothing greater than the good deeds done to others

1317
01:59:32,406 --> 01:59:40,406
There is no greater sacrifice than giving help to
those who are in pain

1318
01:59:43,918 --> 01:59:47,582
If there is no love in your heart will there by
Ramadan moonlight

1319
01:59:48,756 --> 01:59:53,785
Is there more greater happiness than sacrifice?

1320
02:00:04,471 --> 02:00:12,471
God, you have written the story of life with the
pen of times

1321
02:00:15,483 --> 02:00:20,250
Is there any judgment without your will?

1322
02:00:21,022 --> 02:00:24,720
The difficulties in life could be the test for me

1323
02:01:32,025 --> 02:01:33,459
Your prayers have been answered

1324
02:01:37,598 --> 02:01:39,066
Sreekutty's operation is successful

1325
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:43,063
Now she is in recovering room. There is
nothing to be worried about. She is okay

1326
02:01:48,375 --> 02:01:49,706
There is another happy news

1327
02:01:51,479 --> 02:01:53,004
Krishnan is conscious

1328
02:02:04,759 --> 02:02:07,694
Krishnan wants to see you

1329
02:02:32,753 --> 02:02:34,118
You know who this is?

1330
02:02:35,489 --> 02:02:36,456
This is Muhammed

1331
02:02:43,497 --> 02:02:44,464
You lie down

1332
02:02:48,602 --> 02:02:49,091

 am sorry

1333
02:02:50,138 --> 02:02:51,799
Please forgive me

1334
02:02:53,774 --> 02:02:58,473
If we can't forgive why are we humans?

1335
02:03:01,448 --> 02:03:03,644

 have heard God is there

1336
02:03:04,852 --> 02:03:11,849

 hadn't seen God. Now 
 have seen and
touched.

1337
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,121
Don't say like that

1338
02:03:17,665 --> 02:03:19,497
We all are the children of that God

1339
02:03:20,167 --> 02:03:22,101
It is not like what we think

1340
02:03:22,736 --> 02:03:24,602
Things will happen as per God's will

1341
02:03:35,949 --> 02:03:39,886
Dad, we are here.
-Come inside

1342
02:03:45,493 --> 02:03:51,626
There are no issues that can't
be solved or forgiven, Krishnan

1343
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:57,133
After keeping aside all the anger,
someone has come to see you

1344
02:04:25,132 --> 02:04:25,826
Come

1345
02:04:48,723 --> 02:04:53,251
The fight between a husband and wife
shouldn't go beyond a night

1346
02:04:55,630 --> 02:04:57,724
When you two stayed away

1347
02:04:58,298 --> 02:05:00,164
a tender heart got affected

1348
02:05:02,036 --> 02:05:06,633
Even after having dad and mom... Have
you two thought about her becoming alone?

1349
02:05:13,247 --> 02:05:14,874
Let this be a good beginning

1350
02:05:16,584 --> 02:05:20,020
Let God protect the two of you

1351
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:45,667
This is Cheruvillil Moideen Kunju Sahib

1352
02:06:46,741 --> 02:06:49,073
from Karunagappally Taluk of Kollam district

1353
02:06:49,777 --> 02:06:51,211
In a village named Klappana

1354
02:06:51,779 --> 02:06:52,974
shone like sunlight

1355
02:06:54,081 --> 02:06:57,779
Moideen Kunju Sahib, who died in 1986,

1356
02:06:58,252 --> 02:07:01,313
is the real life inspiration for the character of
Muhammed

1357
02:07:02,289 --> 02:07:06,658
Krishnan in the story was a
youth in his neighbourhood

1358
02:07:07,394 --> 02:07:11,627
Considering their privacy,
we are not revealing more details

1359
02:07:12,233 --> 02:07:12,927
Thank You
