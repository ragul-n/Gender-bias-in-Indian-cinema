00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,080
TheDarkMaster[TDM] -=MTR=...

2
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,356
This city is the capital
of politics and mafia,

3
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:02,125
Dhanraj is the ganglord of
the mafia and underworld,

4
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:06,733
Wow! Today I was shattering...

5
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:16,242
He's prince son of Dhanraj who can
dare do any crime and get away.

6
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:17,675
Super figure, buddy!

7
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,492
Why are you getting exam fear
hiccups which I should I get?

8
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,290
Okay wait, I'll get you some water.

9
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,730
She went for water and hasn't
turned up yet, I'll find her.

10
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:22,575
What happened?

11
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:37,523
They killed my friend, sir.

12
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:41,063
They shouldn't live, kill them.

13
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:57,546
Hey ACP! I was expecting you.

14
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:00,206
I'll play not only with girls
but balls too.

15
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:02,045
And I play with criminals like you.

16
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:07,681
Do you know who my father is?

17
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:16,189
How dare! You come to my home
and beat my son!

18
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:18,393
Did you know about me before coming here?

19
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,900
Or were you here to know about me?

20
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:24,802
Bloody creep! Entire state
knows your history.

21
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:29,140
There's no crime you haven't committed
and no section we haven't charged you with.

22
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:31,904
You've taken many chances with police.

23
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:46,920
If I want I can kill you right now.
But I don't want you to die so easily.

24
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:48,360
Come on man!

25
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:51,333
After hearing about Dhanraj's
criminal history,

26
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:53,663
according to law of
City Police act exterminate,

27
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:56,432
the accused Dhanraj is hereby
declared as rowdy sheeter,

28
00:03:56,574 --> 00:04:00,066
under section 22, this court
excommunicates him from the city,

29
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:04,010
and to enter this city again,
he must get permission from the court,

30
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:11,181
and this court orders ACP Shyamsundar to
submit evidence against him in a month.

31
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:30,235
You asked for it last time, right?
How is it?

32
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:31,608
Very good, daddy.

33
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:33,368
Where are mom and others?

34
00:04:39,617 --> 00:04:42,450
Hello mom!
- Hi son! Are you doing fine son?

35
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:53,652
How are you sir?
- Fine Sister.

36
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:57,130
Send him quickly, he has to
attend the class. Come quickly!

37
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:01,331
Go to class.

38
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:03,333
Next time you come with mom and others.

39
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:10,508
Have you forgotten, daddy?
- What?

40
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,218
Leave me!

41
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,531
Go fast!
- Leave me...

42
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:49,876
Hey ACP! You want to see your son?

43
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:52,151
Come to the place I'll tell you.

44
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:53,787
I'll give you a good gift.

45
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:14,908
Why did you stop, man?

46
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:16,577
Come further up!

47
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:46,104
It's me! Had you come a minute earlier,

48
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:50,336
you could've seen your son for
the last time before he got burnt.

49
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:56,017
At least I got my son's ashes,
you'll not get that too.

50
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:58,414
Go and see the valley!

51
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:25,708
Don't think I'll leave you with this,

52
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:30,943
your daughter!

53
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:46,258
I too regret.
I know you've lost your son.

54
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:48,666
But you must be in control of yourself.

55
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,999
What control?

56
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:53,175
My family can't bear the
news of my son's death.

57
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:57,012
I can't tell them the truth, sir.
- Will you resign for that?

58
00:07:57,248 --> 00:08:00,411
If I go after Dhanraj,
I may lose my daughter too.

59
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:03,042
You're wrong, Shyam.
Why are we given a gun?

60
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:05,416
We use it to keep law and
order under control,

61
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:08,820
at times we do get sacrificed
by the same bullet,

62
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:12,060
danger may come from any direction,
but we must do our duty.

63
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:15,858
I too did my duty only sir,
but criminals have taken it as enmity.

64
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,967
The court excommunicated him from the city,

65
00:08:19,203 --> 00:08:21,194
but he took away my son from me,

66
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:23,372
if people are affected,
we are here to protect them,

67
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,600
but if anything happens to us,
who is there to protect us?

68
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,773
There is, if God is the
security of this world,

69
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,110
from today, he's the security God
to you and your family.

70
00:09:40,217 --> 00:09:43,015
Who are you?
Why do you want to kill me?

71
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:46,122
Why do you want to know
about me minutes before dying?

72
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:46,745
No!

73
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:48,892
Wait for few more years
and I'll join you up there,

74
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:50,186
I'll tell you then!

75
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:05,606
Just now started my job!

76
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:23,449
Leap Warrior Pathi Balaji
7th Birthday Wishes

77
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,267
Pathi is like knife in the cut outs.

78
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:37,168
His height too is like knife.

79
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:43,680
Celebrating 7th birthday, father?
He's old like ripened fruit!

80
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:45,005
Don't bother about that.

81
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:47,377
It's not me who is old but your madness.

82
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:50,644
I was born on February 29, I'm 28 now,

83
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,880
I celebrate my birthday
once in every four years,

84
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:54,649
this is my seventh birthday, ain't I right?

85
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:56,382
Are you coming like that?

86
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:59,025
Then you go like this to have feast.
- We're not here for the feast.

87
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:00,027
Then leave the party.

88
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,491
Bouquet is in my hands, father.

89
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,365
Flowers are similar and unique.

90
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:11,204
My foot! All flowers look same
on withering.

91
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,433
Did you buy or pick?

92
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:15,373
Neither, gave it to
few people before you. - Why?

93
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:17,705
We didn't like it.
- Do you like me then?

94
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:19,712
Yes, we're fixed on you.

95
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:23,375
So decided to fix our daughter's marriage
with you who was born on Feb 29.

96
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:24,885
Do you want me to take it out?

97
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:26,753
Sacred thread!

98
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,690
No, please call your parents.
- Sorry, they're not there.

99
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,054
Call them on phone.
- Phones don't work there.

100
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:34,528
Where?
- Up there!

101
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:35,357
Dead?

102
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,795
Mummy, he has no family!
- I've money!

103
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:41,602
Sister will be happy, son.
- Don't rush.

104
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:44,065
Must like first.
- Should my daughter like you?

105
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:46,141
No, I must like your daughter.

106
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:10,226
I wasn't always like this earlier...
Why have I become like this?

107
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:12,834
I'm tired searching franticly...

108
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,935
Silently it came on me...
Pushed me into mad rush...

109
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:22,944
There's a strange emptiness
in heart... Today...

110
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:50,996
Where is he right now?
When will he come?

111
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:55,703
When would he meet me?
When will he do little mistakes with me?

112
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:05,614
When will he take me with him?

113
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:11,218
He's six feet tall and has six pack body...

114
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:13,549
He's handsome like a Hollywood model...

115
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:16,192
His eyes carry the power of megawatts...

116
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,360
He's a mass hero and
in class act one too...

117
00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:32,735
What's the colour he loves?
What's his zodiac sign?

118
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:38,075
What brand car he uses?
What's the name of his pet dog?

119
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:35,932
Is he so handsome to make even katrina
and kareena likes to swoon over him?

120
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:47,946
Is he man with software mind?
Is he a man with heart?

121
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:55,118
Is he a romantic Romeo?
Is he a lover like in Titanic film?

122
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:13,602
I'll take you there, we can have a blast!

123
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:16,437
It'll be very good!

124
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:25,818
ACP has seen me, go fast!

125
00:17:45,602 --> 00:17:46,466
Who are you man?

126
00:17:46,636 --> 00:17:48,968
I'm tired of giving my introduction!

127
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:53,105
Hey you stop! He wants something,
I'll answer him and come to you.

128
00:17:53,343 --> 00:17:54,605
You know Bruce Lee?

129
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:56,609
Jackie Chan?

130
00:17:57,347 --> 00:17:59,747
I'm bloody fighter, you'll bleed if I beat.

131
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,907
Is it? You go boy!

132
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:24,296
Boss, don't know who he is but beating
us to pulp folding his hands.

133
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:15,587
Hey start the car, get going!

134
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,627
Deva, your security officer!

135
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:37,377
Anjali, my golden girl!

136
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:39,538
I'll also have a chocolate.
- No, I'll not give.

137
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:41,047
Please give me one, dear.
- No, I'll not.

138
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:43,880
You've diabetes and stealing
chocolates from grand daughter.

139
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:45,214
Aren't you ashamed to do it?

140
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,029
What's this? What happened?

141
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:00,903
What happened?
Why are you in bandages?

142
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:03,904
What happened, dad?
- Sathya! Come quickly!

143
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:09,638
Fracture?
I told you quit police force.

144
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:11,407
My fear has come true.

145
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:13,572
Just a small accident, don't get tensed.

146
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:20,423
I told you about them, they're
my people who kill me with love.

147
00:20:21,157 --> 00:20:22,749
Mother.
- Greetings madam.

148
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:24,584
Father.
- Greetings.

149
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:25,995
My wife Sathya.

150
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:31,766
This is my friend Leo.

151
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:36,438
Father, Deva will stay here
as security for us.

152
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,934
Show him the outhouse.
- Okay, come.

153
00:20:39,242 --> 00:20:42,234
This is the outhouse,
there's a short man, don't worry. - Why?

154
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:44,174
He acts to much.
- You mean?

155
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:47,445
One who thinks too much about himself.

156
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,184
Is he that short man who is walking
on switched off walker?

157
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,484
He's talking too much, who is he?

158
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:01,961
That is, I'm...
- Did I ask you? I asked him.

159
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:04,498
Tiger doesn't like such things.
- Tiger? Who is he?

160
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:06,031
It's me!

161
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,398
He's new security.

162
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,773
Security? Then, take this.

163
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:19,278
Leave letter?
- No, resignation letter.

164
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:20,208
Changing the department?

165
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:22,547
No, no need of me if he's here,
no need of him if I'm here.

166
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,448
Two swords can be there in a scabbard...

167
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,052
But two Tigers can't live
under one roof, right?

168
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:27,111
Won't you let me talk man?

169
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,951
You sit there and talk,
we'll listen to you.

170
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,888
He blabbers always like this,
I'll take leave.

171
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:31,959
Why is he leaving?

172
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:34,494
Am I security?
I'm your assistant.

173
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:36,287
Unnecessarily I resigned.

174
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:37,830
You can take it back at anytime.

175
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:40,299
Sir, is Tiger your surname
or title awarded to you?

176
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:43,162
It's a fond name given to me by all.
- How come?

177
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:44,937
My grandpa killed a tiger.

178
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,507
Did your father kill another tiger?
- No.

179
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:48,837
That tiger killed my father.
- You should've killed that tiger.

180
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,674
I did try my bad time,
it managed to escape,

181
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:52,678
and I changed my job.

182
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:54,476
You're forgetting a thing
in the family emotion.

183
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:55,640
What?
- Fan switch!

184
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:56,808
Switch it on.

185
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:03,721
You switched on the treadmill
not the fan. Stop it... stop it...

186
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:06,693
Why are frozen like that? Get up...

187
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,095
Come, I'll get ready hot water
for your bath.

188
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:13,534
If he's like this in entry,
will I be there till exit?

189
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:26,045
Why haven't you gone to bed yet?
Go to sleep.

190
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:33,549
I need to talk to you.
- What?

191
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:36,923
The new security doesn't look like one.

192
00:22:37,193 --> 00:22:38,785
He looks like a criminal out of jail.

193
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:41,192
Did you send his dinner?

194
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:45,266
He should worry about you,
why are you worried about him??

195
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:46,466
I don't like this.

196
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,258
Sleeping so early?
- Get up I say!

197
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,768
Won't you sleep sir?
- Do Tigers sleep?

198
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:22,667
Humans sleep.
- Countering me?

199
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,101
Let's watch a horror film.

200
00:23:24,274 --> 00:23:26,265
Do you watch horror films, sir?

201
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:28,400
Do you watch horror films, sir?

202
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:32,279
I watch only horror films.
- No sir, I'm scared.

203
00:23:33,116 --> 00:23:35,414
Scared? Why are you scared
when I'm with you?

204
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:36,415
I'll show you.

205
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:39,020
You show me, sir but I must be
there after that, right?

206
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:42,614
No sir, I don't want to see.
- Don't go to sleep.

207
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:43,781
No sir.
- What?

208
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:46,293
Listen to me, I'll wet the bed.
- Go ahead.

209
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,937
He's scared so much for sound effect,
may be he'll wet bed if he sees.

210
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:06,445
Hey, good thrilling scene, watch it I say.
- I can't sir.

211
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:09,107
How can he get up? I think he
would've swooned for my dare.

212
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:10,775
He'll vanish by tomorrow morning.

213
00:24:26,903 --> 00:24:30,270
Don't tigers go to sleep? Bloody!

214
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:39,003
Nothing to fear.

215
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:18,714
I've got bored drinking
my blood every night.

216
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:20,879
I must try someone else's tomorrow night.

217
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,351
Does he have the habit of drinking blood?

218
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:28,429
For safer side I'll sleep little away.

219
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:41,404
Leo, don't disturb mummy
till I'm back from school.

220
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,579
Do you know to drive?

221
00:25:51,754 --> 00:25:53,619
One who can't fire will not hold a gun,

222
00:25:53,756 --> 00:25:55,116
one who can't drive will
not take the wheel.

223
00:25:55,191 --> 00:25:56,080
Hold it safely and sit.

224
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:58,921
Bald man will not keep a comb,
one who fears will not hold anything.

225
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:00,494
You mind your work.
- Okay, get in.

226
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:14,166
Put on the belt.
- Already wearing it.

227
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:16,107
I meant seat belt not pant belt.

228
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:19,745
Shut your gob and keep driving.

229
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:32,118
Reduce the speed.

230
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:37,163
Reduce the speed, go slow.

231
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:43,968
Pull me back!

232
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:48,042
That's why I told you to
put on the seat belt.

233
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:54,208
Who are you?
Did you find this car to die?

234
00:26:55,785 --> 00:26:58,948
I think I've seen him somewhere.

235
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,451
The girl wants a lift
she's not here to die.

236
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:04,986
Her name is Aiki, baby's friend.

237
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:07,119
Is it school bus or city bus
to board wherever you like?

238
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:08,126
She'll get in.

239
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:10,622
If I refuse?
- I'll get down.

240
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,630
Serious?
- Any doubt?

241
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:16,168
No jokes with me please.
I got down, see!- Bye sir.

242
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:20,006
What's this new twist?

243
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:24,169
Let's give him a shock, how dare he speeds
away without giving dropping me in college.

244
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,380
May I give you a drop?

245
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:32,884
He has already dropped us,
if possible give us lift.

246
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:34,489
Lift means raising, right?

247
00:27:34,657 --> 00:27:37,649
No, drop means throwing out,
lift means asking us to get in.

248
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,657
First give us lift.
- Then get in.

249
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:42,094
But I'll drive the car.

250
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:47,199
Today I'll have a blast!

251
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:50,362
Put on the belt sir.
- I'm wearing it already.

252
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:53,438
I meant seat belt.
- No habit of using it.

253
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:54,871
Make it a habit, it's safe.

254
00:27:55,044 --> 00:27:56,875
Shut your gob, you carry on.

255
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:19,596
Are you angry for dropping them?

256
00:28:19,902 --> 00:28:22,564
Think of someone you love the most,
your anger will vanish.

257
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:23,899
I know it.

258
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:31,072
Go!

259
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:33,078
Aiki sister, you came first.

260
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,141
I thought you'll not come.

261
00:28:35,318 --> 00:28:37,912
Did I ever go to college
without giving you a chocolate?

262
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:40,078
Here's your chocolate.
- Thanks sister.

263
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:45,322
Do you think no one else will
give lift if you refuse?

264
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:49,963
Just a okay is enough entire state's
youth will take her to any place.

265
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:54,629
Are you sad for losing to a girl?

266
00:28:55,304 --> 00:28:58,330
Think of someone you love the most,
your sadness will vanish.

267
00:28:58,508 --> 00:28:59,770
Super sister!

268
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,945
Here's your chocolate, sister.

269
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:09,782
Your chocolate.

270
00:29:10,253 --> 00:29:11,845
Let's go to class, we're getting late.

271
00:29:12,588 --> 00:29:13,953
What's the girl's psychology?

272
00:29:14,457 --> 00:29:16,584
Elder one or the little one?
- The little baby.

273
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:19,885
Why are they so happy giving
chocolates to each other?

274
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:21,222
That's friendship!

275
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:23,827
What's this?

276
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:32,134
Do you want to be my friend
by giving me a chocolate?

277
00:29:32,308 --> 00:29:36,210
My foot psychology!
- Abuse me but not my psychology.

278
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:40,039
Psychology is great art where you
can read faces to tell character.

279
00:29:40,216 --> 00:29:43,117
Are you so great? Then see his face
and tell about his character.

280
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,783
His psychology is idiotic,
and kick psychology.

281
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:49,786
Didn't get it?

282
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:54,162
Even if you abuse him or beat him,
he'll come to without any reaction,

283
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:57,266
fall at your feet and say sorry,
that's his mentality.

284
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,725
If you've guts, prove it.

285
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,834
Hey you! Come here!

286
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:06,835
Come here man!

287
00:30:08,444 --> 00:30:09,274
Did you call me sir?

288
00:30:09,512 --> 00:30:11,002
Yes boy!
- Please tell me.

289
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,512
Go... go man!

290
00:30:21,023 --> 00:30:23,651
I couldn't judge him properly,
why are you taking the risk?

291
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:25,487
You're so small, come with me.

292
00:30:27,263 --> 00:30:32,200
No use, he came meekly and
turned into a hard nail.

293
00:30:32,735 --> 00:30:34,669
We must send him out from here at any cost.

294
00:30:35,371 --> 00:30:36,171
What?

295
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,034
What if we three go like
ghosts and scare him?

296
00:30:38,774 --> 00:30:43,143
It's enough we both put ghost mass,
uncle anyway looks like one.

297
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:48,450
Don't underestimate Deva,
he's ghost of ghosts.

298
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:49,980
Ghost king!

299
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:52,916
He'll chase us out!
- What shall we do now?

300
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:56,682
Must get drunk, don't get
surprized, not you both me!

301
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:09,231
Hey useless fellow, stop that
work and make me a large.

302
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:13,633
Do you drink alone, sir.
- I don't drink with fools.

303
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:14,639
But I do!

304
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:17,411
Only fools drink alone,
gentlemen drink together.

305
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,411
Nothing short in countering,
fix my drink first.

306
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:22,645
Can't you make the drink here?

307
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:25,311
Did you clean the glass?
- Washed clean!

308
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,949
Is the peg okay to you, sir?

309
00:31:38,868 --> 00:31:41,336
Sir, what's your opinion about me?

310
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:42,860
Shall I tell the truth or lie?

311
00:31:43,105 --> 00:31:44,667
Neither this nor that,
say something in between.

312
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,103
That's too much, how can one say like that?

313
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:48,576
Never put such questions.
Ask only easy questions.

314
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:49,335
Okay.

315
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:53,914
You look like a cylinder
and an upright percussion instrument.

316
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:57,009
How could you judge it perfectly?

317
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,280
How did you get this job?
- Sports quota.

318
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:00,422
Which sport?

319
00:32:00,723 --> 00:32:01,417
Do you play cricket?

320
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,286
Asking me if I know cricket?
I'm king of cricket.

321
00:32:04,427 --> 00:32:05,792
To watch or play?

322
00:32:05,928 --> 00:32:08,055
Making satires on me, I play, man!

323
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:11,395
You won't mind if I ask you
a friendly question, right?

324
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:14,961
We're friends while drinking,
ask me anything.

325
00:32:15,171 --> 00:32:15,830
Is it?
- Yes.

326
00:32:15,972 --> 00:32:17,633
How many balls make an over?

327
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:24,703
Are you asking how many balls
make an over in cricket?

328
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,280
Poor fellow, six balls!
- Only one!

329
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,209
How come?

330
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:30,443
They use one ball to bowl six times.
- Hit me!

331
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,951
Are you a batsman or bowler, sir?
- I'm a fielder.

332
00:32:33,122 --> 00:32:36,785
Do you take catches?
You take catches!

333
00:32:42,331 --> 00:32:43,320
Catch this!

334
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:46,596
What's in your hand?
- Grape!

335
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:47,430
Grape?

336
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:53,434
What a great catch!
You take catches brilliantly.

337
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:55,008
Would they offer jobs just like that?

338
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:56,769
Let's have another peg.
- Sit. - Another peg.

339
00:32:57,146 --> 00:33:01,344
What a great talent!
Sir, cheers once more!

340
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:06,148
Will you catch anything, sir?
- Gun?

341
00:33:06,722 --> 00:33:08,986
I'll catch it with one finger!

342
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,657
What's that?
- I'll tell you.

343
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:13,488
Why are you loading it?

344
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:17,658
What's that?

345
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:18,695
Catch the bullet!

346
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:19,823
Bullet?
- Yes sir.

347
00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:21,469
Is it ball to catch?

348
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:27,032
Catch it!
- It may go off. Catch it.

349
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:29,541
I beg you, it may fire!
I beg you, please leave me.

350
00:33:29,712 --> 00:33:33,773
I'm still a bachelor!
Leave me...

351
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:37,213
Catch it...
- Leave me...

352
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:39,217
Greetings sir.
- Who is it?

353
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:42,554
Where are you hiding man?

354
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,624
I beg you!
Please leave me.

355
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,394
Will you ask me to make your drink?

356
00:33:52,735 --> 00:33:54,232
I'll never do it again,
I'll make my own drink.

357
00:33:54,236 --> 00:33:55,726
Are you officer and I'm your assistant?

358
00:33:56,238 --> 00:33:58,900
Did I say that? I would've!

359
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:01,566
You're an officer and I'm your assistant.

360
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:02,674
Will you act smart with me?
- No.

361
00:34:02,745 --> 00:34:03,534
Never again, right?
- No.

362
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:04,743
Let's have another peg.

363
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:11,250
I'll give you a test, is it okay?
- Tell me.

364
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,116
I can sign blindfold, can you do it?

365
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:17,121
I'll do it.
- First, I'll do it.

366
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:19,353
Show me your hand.

367
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,597
Now, you must do it.
Close your eyes.

368
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:32,169
Sign now... here.

369
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,241
What are you doing?
She's getting too smart.

370
00:34:35,544 --> 00:34:38,104
What happened, Sathya?
- This is her progress report.

371
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:40,238
I know, that's why I'm signing it.

372
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,440
Did you see her marks?
All C grades.

373
00:34:42,618 --> 00:34:45,348
You're supporting her.
- Leave it sir, just a little girl.

374
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:50,284
This is out family matter,
tell strangers to stay out of it.

375
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:52,391
I don't want any outside interference.

376
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:57,928
No problem sir.

377
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:01,292
Why did you bring me here?

378
00:35:01,604 --> 00:35:03,299
Come, I'll tell you.

379
00:35:04,306 --> 00:35:07,935
Why has she changed so much?
Why is she taking me aside?

380
00:35:08,777 --> 00:35:09,607
Coming.

381
00:35:15,451 --> 00:35:18,284
Don't split my name and call,
I'm going crazy.

382
00:35:18,454 --> 00:35:21,116
Can you do a thing for me?

383
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,781
Not just one I can do two
or three things for you.

384
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:27,952
Tell me what should I do?
- Please bend there once!

385
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:31,763
Do you like it?
- Yes.

386
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:34,966
What will you do, you dimpled girl?

387
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:37,162
I'll not tell, I'll do it.

388
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:38,598
I'm a macho warrior!

389
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:42,776
Come... come...

390
00:35:48,817 --> 00:35:50,478
Did she ask me to bend for this?

391
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:54,589
She's not ordinary girl, she'll
show milk but make you drink acid.

392
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,157
Why are you washing the car, sir?

393
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:03,159
Why am I washing? You jumped
over the wall and came in, right?

394
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:04,627
Yes.
- Right?

395
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,629
It means he's hitting you
and me in different types.

396
00:36:08,804 --> 00:36:12,205
You do one thing, you go on jump
the wall and I'll keep wiping the car.

397
00:36:12,374 --> 00:36:14,706
He refused to give you lift, right?
Why did you come here then?

398
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:17,209
Even if he refuses,
I'm here to get in by force.

399
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:19,370
Will you get in even if he says no?

400
00:36:19,715 --> 00:36:21,307
You're no ordinary girl.

401
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:24,046
Inside the boot?

402
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:32,391
You told me to clean this car.

403
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:39,557
Will you take that car?
Go sir.

404
00:36:46,242 --> 00:36:48,904
Come out. You made a silly plan.
- What?

405
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:51,239
Come out
- What happened?

406
00:36:52,147 --> 00:36:54,911
He outsmarted you!

407
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:38,790
Have you seen the girl in this photo?
- No sir.

408
00:37:51,907 --> 00:37:53,932
Hey Deva! Get down!

409
00:37:55,444 --> 00:37:57,275
Get down I say!

410
00:37:58,213 --> 00:37:59,612
He has already got down.

411
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:03,377
Shut up! Don't I know that?

412
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:07,555
I'm not drunk.

413
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,222
What?

414
00:38:10,726 --> 00:38:11,886
Will you kill him?

415
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:15,662
How can I live if he dies?

416
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:19,598
Devadas became a drunkard for Parvathi,

417
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:24,834
but I, Parvathi of this Deva had few pegs.

418
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:26,840
Your name isn't Parvathi, is it?

419
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:32,678
Shut up! If I beat you again,
you'll swoon!

420
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:33,678
I'll keep shut.

421
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:39,819
If one drinks in sadness,
it's to forget sorrows,

422
00:38:40,322 --> 00:38:42,222
if you drink in love...

423
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,222
if you drink in love,
it's to express bravely.

424
00:38:54,703 --> 00:38:55,863
Take her away!

425
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:00,202
Are you feeling bad because he slapped you?

426
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:03,267
Are you feeling sad if I slap you?

427
00:39:03,545 --> 00:39:09,211
You never felt bad when I beat you,
why would I feel bad if Deva beats me?

428
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:42,310
O my mad girl!
You're igniting my heart...

429
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:55,090
O my dear girl!
Caressing me like fire...

430
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:04,767
My hearts is yours...
my youth is all yours...

431
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:08,775
My life is in chaos because of you...

432
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:13,280
My youth desires your
hot passionate bosom...

433
00:40:13,415 --> 00:40:18,114
The stinging loneliness must
leave me once for all tonight...

434
00:41:09,271 --> 00:41:13,332
Don't rush like Ganges...
don't drown me in that flow...

435
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:17,502
Don't play with my life with
your youthful bounties...

436
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:21,706
Don't frown at me...
Don't knock-out my little...

437
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:26,047
Don't maul me wet shorts
and raise my pulse...

438
00:41:26,255 --> 00:41:30,316
In my dreams and in real,
I'm always yearning for you...

439
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:34,690
I'm giving you my bountiful youth to you...

440
00:41:34,863 --> 00:41:39,027
I'm coming pining for you
shedding all my inhibitions...

441
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:44,036
Though it's simmering fire inside,
I'm wetting you like water...

442
00:42:26,248 --> 00:42:30,412
You've filled my heart with
the fragrance of your beauty...

443
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:34,750
You've moved me with your pink cheeks...

444
00:42:34,923 --> 00:42:39,087
You've put designs on my eyes
with your shyness...

445
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:43,254
You've brought heaven before me...

446
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:47,391
Filling my cells with passions
and nerves with desires...

447
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:51,733
Every moment is bliss and I'm all yours...

448
00:42:51,907 --> 00:42:56,105
Stumbling and falling on you...

449
00:42:56,244 --> 00:43:01,113
I want to experience love,
let's share it...

450
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:44,116
Deva, you took money,
settled there as bodyguard,

451
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:46,556
when are you delivering the girl to me?

452
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:49,453
It took me 10 days to win
the family's trust,

453
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:53,260
if I take up a job,
accomplishing it is my habit.

454
00:43:53,568 --> 00:43:57,004
I'll bring the girl to you
by 5 pm on coming Sunday.

455
00:43:57,172 --> 00:43:59,504
It's Sunday, didn't get
phone call from Moksha yet?

456
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:02,667
If it rings, I'll talk first
with my grandson.

457
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:05,511
He's my heir.
I'll talk to him first.

458
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:07,342
Father-in-law, I'm his mother,

459
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:08,878
I'll not let anyone else talk to him first.

460
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,750
Stop, it's old fashion to talk
to grannies and mothers.

461
00:44:12,888 --> 00:44:17,052
He'll talk to his girl friend first.
So, I'll talk to him first.

462
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:20,251
I'm his little sister,
so he'll talk to me first.

463
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:21,384
Isn't it dear?

464
00:44:38,714 --> 00:44:40,545
You know everything,
yet, are you playing with us?

465
00:44:40,716 --> 00:44:41,444
What happened, Sathya?

466
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,050
We were waiting for his
phone call since morning,

467
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:45,652
you knew it, why didn't you tell us?

468
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:49,315
That is... how to break it to you...

469
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:50,425
How to break it?

470
00:44:50,792 --> 00:44:52,054
It's over a month since I've seen him,

471
00:44:52,194 --> 00:44:53,422
now he has gone on some excursion,

472
00:44:53,595 --> 00:44:55,062
it he'll not come back before a week,

473
00:44:55,197 --> 00:44:57,358
when will I see him?
When will I talk to him?

474
00:45:00,068 --> 00:45:02,298
You can't understand a mother's heart.

475
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:12,903
You saved my son and came closer to us,

476
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:17,074
likewise tell Shyam and bring back
our grandson who is away from us.

477
00:45:17,419 --> 00:45:20,320
My wife isn't asking you to
bring him to sing lullabies,

478
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:22,787
I'm not asking you to bring
him to tell stories,

479
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:25,654
we're yearning to see him,
we miss him a lot.

480
00:45:26,094 --> 00:45:26,894
Okay.

481
00:45:38,206 --> 00:45:39,571
I want to tell you something.

482
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:46,241
Come in Deva.

483
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:48,575
This is Moksha's room.

484
00:45:49,251 --> 00:45:54,814
Though he's not now, he has left
these memories to remember him always.

485
00:45:55,257 --> 00:45:58,090
They're feeling so sad for
not getting a phone call,

486
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,988
what would be their plight
if they know he's no more?

487
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:06,233
Family painting by him.

488
00:46:08,703 --> 00:46:10,728
But he's missing from it.

489
00:46:11,306 --> 00:46:12,830
He was first in everything.

490
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:17,104
I didn't know he'll be first in death too.

491
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:23,713
I'm now left with Anjali.

492
00:46:30,225 --> 00:46:31,783
You promised to bring the girl by 5 pm,

493
00:46:31,993 --> 00:46:33,221
the time now is 4 pm,

494
00:46:33,395 --> 00:46:38,332
I told you at the appointed time
and place I'll be there with her.

495
00:46:38,466 --> 00:46:39,433
Cut the line.

496
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:44,262
Enough grandma, I can't eat anymore.

497
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,604
You've to do home work too,
this is the last mouthful.

498
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,774
You spend more time with it
than on studies.

499
00:46:50,946 --> 00:46:52,607
You've come down to C grades from A grades,

500
00:46:52,848 --> 00:46:55,442
you'll not study well until
I get this puppy thrown out.

501
00:46:57,085 --> 00:46:59,986
Mummy, please don't send it away.

502
00:47:00,155 --> 00:47:03,147
Give it to Blue Cross.
I mustn't see it again.

503
00:47:03,325 --> 00:47:08,661
Please don't send it away.
You sent away brother, now Rio too!

504
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,424
Don't talk, come silently.
- I'll not have anyone to play with.

505
00:47:14,135 --> 00:47:16,695
If you take away what kids love,
they'll get hurt.

506
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:17,861
We must understand it.

507
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,633
Is he here as body guard or
teach us morals, mother-in-law?

508
00:47:20,775 --> 00:47:23,972
Tell him to be within his limits,
why are you still here, Tiger?

509
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:25,203
Take it away.

510
00:47:31,786 --> 00:47:32,718
Where are you going?

511
00:47:32,888 --> 00:47:34,549
Madam told me, right? To Blue Cross.

512
00:47:34,723 --> 00:47:36,213
I'll smash your bald head.

513
00:47:39,694 --> 00:47:42,595
If I don't take it, she'll fire,
if I do, he'll fire me.

514
00:47:44,466 --> 00:47:45,956
Where am I to keep it?

515
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:15,295
Keep playing, I'll be back in minutes.

516
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:34,111
Who is he?

517
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:37,783
Boss, he's the man who beat us folding
hands while you were on phone.

518
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,920
He's not our man.

519
00:48:59,841 --> 00:49:00,830
Who are you man?

520
00:49:00,942 --> 00:49:02,933
He wants my introduction, shall I give?

521
00:49:03,111 --> 00:49:04,772
No boss, he'll beat us black and blue.

522
00:49:04,946 --> 00:49:08,609
No, I'll not waste time and
come to the point directly.

523
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:12,044
Till I'm there,
you can't touch that family.

524
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,711
Do whatsoever you can do!

525
00:49:50,258 --> 00:49:51,190
What?

526
00:49:51,326 --> 00:49:53,351
Give me signal when
Deva comes, right?- Why?

527
00:49:53,728 --> 00:49:55,559
Just do what I say!
- Why?

528
00:49:56,364 --> 00:49:58,594
Please listen to me.
- You listen to me first.

529
00:50:20,622 --> 00:50:22,681
Sister! Chitti is very beautiful.

530
00:50:23,258 --> 00:50:24,247
Beautiful than your sister?

531
00:50:24,426 --> 00:50:26,223
That is...
- Like my foot!

532
00:50:27,228 --> 00:50:29,856
May be she's his girl friend,
your competitor.

533
00:50:30,031 --> 00:50:31,931
Is she really more beautiful?

534
00:50:59,561 --> 00:51:06,561
O My Chitti, you're raking up
my mood with your kisses...

535
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:14,902
You're holding me,
ringing the bell in my heart...

536
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:20,173
You're raising a hell...

537
00:51:20,748 --> 00:51:27,748
Come on, put your hands on me...

538
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:37,358
If you take chances with me,
is it okay if you're in danger?

539
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:45,166
My heart is leaping on seeing you...
your ravishing waist is mindboggling...

540
00:51:45,974 --> 00:51:52,974
My heart is waving green signal...
I'm all yours it says...

541
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:36,488
Your beauty is tempting me
to take on you...

542
00:52:36,658 --> 00:52:40,355
Your wet lips are pushing me to rush...

543
00:52:40,528 --> 00:52:44,157
Youth is pestering not to leave you...

544
00:52:44,365 --> 00:52:48,165
The chillness of yearning is killing me...

545
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:52,032
Praising you, I'll fall at your feet...

546
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:55,699
I'll pinch your cheeks...
I'll crush you in my arms...

547
00:52:55,877 --> 00:52:59,870
Let me see what you're up to...

548
00:53:00,048 --> 00:53:03,711
If you delay further, I'll come with you...

549
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:10,885
I'm going crazy smitten by your beauty...

550
00:53:11,693 --> 00:53:15,561
My heart goes crazy seeing you...

551
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:19,724
Your roving eyes are devouring me...

552
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:15,082
Passionate desires are taking over me
Sensational, your red hot youth...

553
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:30,831
Your smile is magic...
it's my silk hanky...

554
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:38,639
I've tasted and yearning for more...
- To fall on you and lose my sanctity...

555
00:54:57,031 --> 00:55:00,000
Drink milk without barking,
if not you'll go to Blue cross.

556
00:55:00,134 --> 00:55:00,998
You fool drink!

557
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:03,660
Mummy may find you, don't bark.

558
00:55:13,014 --> 00:55:15,710
I've come first time to your out house,
won't you offer tea snacks?

559
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:18,145
Why not? There's milk for you here.

560
00:55:18,386 --> 00:55:20,650
Milk is there.
I'll make tea for you.

561
00:55:26,094 --> 00:55:28,153
Do you like tea so much?
- Very much.

562
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:29,762
I can see it.

563
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:31,692
Will be great! Have it.

564
00:55:31,866 --> 00:55:33,697
You have it.

565
00:55:33,868 --> 00:55:35,859
I'm allergic to tea.
- Please have it.

566
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:37,197
No problem, you have it.

567
00:55:37,372 --> 00:55:39,272
Take it.
- No please.

568
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:46,211
Tea is fantastic!
Your hands are magical, sir.

569
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:49,207
Little more please.
- Have it.

570
00:55:49,384 --> 00:55:53,150
You too have it.
- Please have it. No please.

571
00:55:56,724 --> 00:56:00,023
Why are you insisting?
- Tea made by Tiger is great!

572
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:01,554
Where did you get the milk?
- It was here.

573
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:02,927
I kept it for the dog.

574
00:56:04,465 --> 00:56:06,365
I made tea.
- I had it.

575
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:09,559
I knew it was dog's milk,
that's why I refused to have tea.

576
00:56:10,071 --> 00:56:12,562
You're very smart. Come...

577
00:56:39,901 --> 00:56:42,563
You called urgently here,
want to tell me anything?

578
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,260
Yes Balaji.

579
00:56:47,842 --> 00:56:50,106
About him?
- Yes.

580
00:56:50,578 --> 00:56:54,173
I'm confused if he's a good man or bad man.

581
00:56:54,682 --> 00:56:57,674
Have you understood anything?
- I'm enlightened.

582
00:56:57,852 --> 00:57:00,013
Still not yet for me.

583
00:57:01,189 --> 00:57:06,126
You know psychology, right?
Why not suggest an idea?

584
00:57:09,831 --> 00:57:11,731
Deva loves the little girl.

585
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:14,626
Call him and tell someone
is kidnapping her,

586
00:57:15,303 --> 00:57:19,637
if he comes hurriedly,
he's a good man, if not, he's a crook.

587
00:57:20,074 --> 00:57:23,601
Simple idea but super!

588
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:34,783
It's me Aiki, someone is trying
to kidnap Anjali.

589
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:35,922
What?

590
00:57:37,225 --> 00:57:39,659
I told him, let's see if he comes or not.

591
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:52,833
Tell me sir.
- Where are you?

592
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:56,272
You told me to pick up
Anjali from school, right? I'm in school.

593
00:57:56,511 --> 00:57:57,341
Is everything fine there?

594
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:01,339
Look carefully.

595
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,050
All are fine.

596
00:58:06,254 --> 00:58:07,915
Do you see suspicious people around?

597
00:58:08,256 --> 00:58:10,315
I don't see anyone suspicious here.

598
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:20,900
Few fat people in black dresses...
- Do as I tell you.

599
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:33,240
What sort of a school is this, boss?

600
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:37,377
All are Sachin Tendulkars.
- Tendulkars?

601
00:58:37,685 --> 00:58:40,210
All are wearing Tendulkar masks.

602
00:58:40,388 --> 00:58:43,050
Stop that nonsense and
remove the masks and search.

603
00:58:43,224 --> 00:58:46,193
I want the girl.
- Boys, search!

604
00:59:10,585 --> 00:59:11,745
Run boys!

605
00:59:16,924 --> 00:59:21,486
Come my dear... come.
- Your idea is super.

606
00:59:22,697 --> 00:59:23,425
Thank you very much.

607
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:25,030
You too can join us in car from tomorrow.

608
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:28,560
My idea has turned against me.

609
00:59:40,448 --> 00:59:41,107
Greetings Swami!

610
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:46,019
Have you seen the girl in the photo?
- No sir.

611
00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:56,891
Anjali, go slow, you may fall down.

612
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:02,163
Come my dear.

613
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,868
Swami, please bless so that
my son recovers quickly.

614
01:00:09,043 --> 01:00:11,603
Offer special prayers to Baba
and distribute offering.

615
01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:14,771
Everything will be fine.
- As you say Swami.

616
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:38,163
Tiger, how lucky you are
like honey bees in a honey comb.

617
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,665
How affectionately madam has sent dinner.

618
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:43,002
Before that idiot comes, I must finish it.

619
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:48,172
You always come at right time,
how do you do it?

620
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:49,316
What are you doing?

621
01:00:49,517 --> 01:00:53,647
Nothing, I want to enlarge
this dining table.

622
01:00:53,821 --> 01:00:57,313
Why do you want to do it?
- What's that?

623
01:00:57,491 --> 01:01:01,325
I'm a bachelor, so Sathya madam has
sent offering made to God.

624
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:02,584
Will you eat it all by yourself?

625
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:05,358
I mustn't share it, it was sent
for me and only I should eat it.

626
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:06,455
Won't you share it with me?
- No.

627
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,023
Eat!

628
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:11,300
Tamarind rice is great!
Vada wow!

629
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:14,869
Milk pudding!
- Pudding?!

630
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:25,709
Lick it!
- It's already licking!

631
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:27,877
I don't know what you do,
I want pudding now!

632
01:01:28,055 --> 01:01:30,216
If you say urgent, do you want me to beg?

633
01:01:30,391 --> 01:01:31,585
Do you want me to steal?

634
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,351
You're great, how do you get such ideas?

635
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:36,427
I don't know.

636
01:01:37,965 --> 01:01:39,364
Steal it.
- Steal?!

637
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:40,227
Yes.

638
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:41,390
Can't avoid it?
- No.

639
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:43,897
Then you too must join me.
- Why?

640
01:01:44,071 --> 01:01:45,470
To encourage me.

641
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:47,800
You want me to steal pudding.
- Okay, come.

642
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:58,915
You may bark at thieves,
but I'm not a thief.

643
01:01:59,086 --> 01:02:02,647
Please don't bark at me, I beg you.

644
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:08,952
Should it have to go to the kitchen now?

645
01:02:14,435 --> 01:02:16,630
Deva will kill me if I don't
go with pudding.

646
01:02:17,505 --> 01:02:19,564
If I take it, this may bark
and have me caught.

647
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:25,242
If you get me caught, would police
give you gold medal for it?

648
01:02:25,446 --> 01:02:26,572
No way!

649
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:30,245
Shyam sir got fractures for
doing his duty honestly.

650
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:32,076
Listen to me, move aside.

651
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,289
Why are you looking there?
Search the fridge.

652
01:02:53,307 --> 01:02:55,366
Don't bark loudly, people may wake up.

653
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:03,207
What?

654
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:06,116
What are you doing here at this hour?

655
01:03:06,287 --> 01:03:08,949
I came here for pudding.

656
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:11,717
Why to steal it? I would've
given if you had asked me.

657
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,218
How come Rio is here?

658
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:16,789
I don't know how it came here, madam.

659
01:03:16,997 --> 01:03:19,465
You mean didn't hand it over to Blue Cross.

660
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:25,768
Liar! Moreover stealing!
Are you here to guard or rob us?

661
01:03:26,273 --> 01:03:27,672
My husband doesn't know your true colour,

662
01:03:27,842 --> 01:03:30,504
that's why I warned you not to enter home.
But still you dared to enter,

663
01:03:30,678 --> 01:03:33,841
aren't you ashamed?
Get out!

664
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:45,815
Uncle, I've brought your favourite pudding.

665
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:48,324
No need dear.
- Sad for scolding you?

666
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:50,725
Think of people you love,
your anger will ease,

667
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:53,030
come on think!

668
01:03:53,734 --> 01:03:56,225
I did think, I'm fine now.
- Then, have it.

669
01:03:56,437 --> 01:03:58,530
You must listen to me.
- I'll do whatever you say.

670
01:03:58,706 --> 01:04:00,637
You're getting bad grades in school,
you must top the class.

671
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,699
I used to top class when brother was here,

672
01:04:02,877 --> 01:04:04,708
now I don't have any
competitor here, right?

673
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:08,205
If your brother refuses to talk
to you for getting low grades.

674
01:04:08,382 --> 01:04:09,542
He'll never say that.
- If he says so.

675
01:04:09,717 --> 01:04:14,450
Then you must do as I tell you.
- Okay, I will. Then have it.

676
01:04:16,657 --> 01:04:17,314
I'm waiting for it.

677
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,119
How is it?
- As good as you!

678
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,220
For me then?

679
01:04:55,596 --> 01:05:02,596
Fill the little heart with hope...

680
01:05:07,107 --> 01:05:13,842
Spread smile on the
golden little girl's lips...

681
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:22,349
Showering my affection...
build a bond of friendship...

682
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:30,791
Take her to the limelight of success...
Make her write her own future...

683
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:34,634
May I become her step to march ahead...

684
01:05:34,802 --> 01:05:37,635
May I become protector of her existence...

685
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:40,466
May I become shadow following her...

686
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:43,439
May I become the boat for
her journey of life...

687
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,087
Why did you call me now sir?

688
01:06:01,261 --> 01:06:03,456
I'm alone, join me for a drink.

689
01:06:05,165 --> 01:06:06,894
Why not have small drink?
- Why?

690
01:06:08,168 --> 01:06:08,964
I'll not do anything.

691
01:06:10,771 --> 01:06:14,002
No way, a small please.
- I swear on you.

692
01:06:14,174 --> 01:06:14,833
Then make it.

693
01:06:16,443 --> 01:06:18,172
Enough...
- Very small!

694
01:06:18,779 --> 01:06:22,271
You make it large for yourself.
Nothing will affect you.

695
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:28,254
How come you've become so smart suddenly?

696
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:32,823
I'm born smart!
- Shall we play a game for fun?

697
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,723
Game? What game?
- Very funny game.

698
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:36,927
Tell me first what's the game.

699
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:39,192
You ask me 4 questions,
I'll ask you 4 questions.

700
01:06:39,366 --> 01:06:42,995
Questions? Come on ask.
- How much is one plus one?

701
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:43,931
One...

702
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:51,606
How much is one plus one?
Is it any tough question?

703
01:06:51,779 --> 01:06:53,610
Should I answer it?

704
01:06:56,984 --> 01:07:00,784
Please answer it.
- Oh no, it's very tough question.

705
01:07:00,988 --> 01:07:05,687
How much is one plus one?
One plus one is two.

706
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:08,384
How much is this?
- One.

707
01:07:08,762 --> 01:07:09,524
This?
- One.

708
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:10,754
If you add?
- Two.

709
01:07:10,931 --> 01:07:11,590
Eleven!

710
01:07:11,765 --> 01:07:12,754
How can it become eleven?

711
01:07:12,933 --> 01:07:17,233
You've started beating me again.
You've promised not to beat me.

712
01:07:17,404 --> 01:07:18,735
I'll not beat you.

713
01:07:20,741 --> 01:07:22,072
I'll not answer.
- Why?

714
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:24,733
You ask the question and beat me to pulp.

715
01:07:24,912 --> 01:07:27,073
No questions, I'll not beat you.
- No?

716
01:07:27,247 --> 01:07:28,236
Let's play another game.

717
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:30,245
Can you dance?
- Dance?

718
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:30,906
Can't you?

719
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:33,645
Can't? I love to dance
from my childhood.

720
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:36,415
I can dance, make your choice.

721
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:39,589
Why are you alighting steps?

722
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:46,596
I got it, Amitabh Bachchan's song.
Make a drink for me.

723
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,860
That's better.
- Make it.

724
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:51,663
Amitabh's song is great!
I must have a large.

725
01:07:53,674 --> 01:07:54,436
Dance!

726
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,172
That's good.
- Why are you standing on t?

727
01:07:58,345 --> 01:07:59,505
Amitabh is tall, right?

728
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:05,741
What are you doing in my courtyard?

729
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,748
What happened?
- It's slow.

730
01:08:15,629 --> 01:08:16,288
You want that, right?

731
01:08:17,498 --> 01:08:19,159
I would've fallen down,
thanks for holding me.

732
01:08:32,546 --> 01:08:38,712
Come... come... sit here.
You're great! Sit here.

733
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:40,715
You're multi-talented!

734
01:08:42,523 --> 01:08:45,617
You're finished with your questions,
it's now my turn to ask.

735
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:46,451
Ask.
- May I?

736
01:08:46,727 --> 01:08:47,421
Ask.

737
01:08:47,561 --> 01:08:53,966
What's that I've and you don't?
Look, you're confused.

738
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:58,502
What's that I've and you don't?
Answer me.

739
01:08:59,173 --> 01:08:59,973
Heart!

740
01:09:01,842 --> 01:09:04,504
Yes. Heart, that's what you don't have.

741
01:09:05,512 --> 01:09:08,504
A girl is after you like Hutch dog,

742
01:09:08,682 --> 01:09:10,980
but you don't have a heart
to know the reason for it?

743
01:09:12,886 --> 01:09:14,979
You may not allow me to enter your heart,

744
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:19,057
but even God himself can't
take you out from my heart.

745
01:09:23,063 --> 01:09:27,295
Aiki loves you truely,
why are you avoiding her?

746
01:09:29,436 --> 01:09:31,870
Who you are really?
Why have you come here?

747
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:33,864
Why are you playing with all of us?

748
01:09:50,457 --> 01:09:53,915
How could you happy with us
so much sorrow in your heart?

749
01:10:02,302 --> 01:10:05,567
You're a police officer,
everyone's eye is on you,

750
01:10:05,906 --> 01:10:07,134
be careful son.

751
01:10:08,408 --> 01:10:12,139
Your wife used to fear this dress,
I used to comfort her,

752
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,071
now I'm more scared than her.

753
01:10:15,249 --> 01:10:16,648
You too father!

754
01:10:19,753 --> 01:10:20,242
What's it dear?

755
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,753
Today is my school annual day,
you've promised to make it.

756
01:10:23,924 --> 01:10:24,447
Won't you come?

757
01:10:25,158 --> 01:10:27,649
My dear, dad needs to attend office,
I'll take you.

758
01:10:28,762 --> 01:10:29,456
Come.

759
01:11:08,201 --> 01:11:09,634
Go to your mom!

760
01:11:17,544 --> 01:11:18,101
What's it?

761
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:22,447
Your security guard Deva's file.
Must send it to Delhi immediately.

762
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,111
Is he Deva?
- Yes sir, he's Deva.

763
01:11:36,663 --> 01:11:37,493
Then who is he?

764
01:11:37,664 --> 01:11:42,124
Winner in sprint at the
annual sports meet is Baby Anjali...

765
01:11:46,173 --> 01:11:48,835
First in drawing competition
is Baby Anjali...

766
01:11:50,177 --> 01:11:52,771
First in dance competition
is Baby Anjali...

767
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:06,649
The man who came to our home
as security guard is not Deva,

768
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:09,728
he's a fraud, take care of family,
I'm coming there.

769
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:17,030
You sit here.

770
01:13:01,415 --> 01:13:04,578
I want his complete details
on my table in 24 hours.

771
01:13:09,322 --> 01:13:09,981
What's it dear?

772
01:13:10,157 --> 01:13:13,251
I, Grandma, grandpa, mummy
and are going to visit brother.

773
01:13:14,761 --> 01:13:15,819
Give the phone to mummy.

774
01:14:09,216 --> 01:14:11,275
Shouldn't you inform me before going there?

775
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:13,282
How many times should I ask
you to take me to my son?

776
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:15,614
I'm going to meet my son.
I'm not doing any wrong.

777
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:16,615
I'm telling you...

778
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:20,282
You may, you can stay without seeing him,
we can't live without grandson.

779
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,054
No father...
- Do you remember today is his birthday?

780
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:25,824
Did we ever celebrate his
birthday without us?

781
01:14:25,999 --> 01:14:27,660
She got tired asking you.

782
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:30,098
You don't take us,
and stopping us from going there.

783
01:14:30,403 --> 01:14:32,667
No need to discuss, you too join us, daddy.

784
01:14:32,839 --> 01:14:35,000
Let's all go together and
wish him on his birthday.

785
01:14:35,175 --> 01:14:37,166
He'll not come and
not take us there. Let's go.

786
01:14:37,344 --> 01:14:39,335
Listen to me.
- I must see him.

787
01:14:39,513 --> 01:14:41,504
Only if he's alive!

788
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:22,719
Sathya, take away Anjali.

789
01:15:27,627 --> 01:15:31,085
If you hurt my family,
none of you will live.

790
01:15:37,637 --> 01:15:38,569
Go away!

791
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:47,246
You made me kill my own son.

792
01:16:25,251 --> 01:16:28,743
Time is up for you.
- My time has begun just now.

793
01:16:29,122 --> 01:16:31,920
I got the entire family in one place.

794
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:36,955
The way I killed his son,
watch me killing them all.

795
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,791
Look there!

796
01:17:10,997 --> 01:17:11,759
Brother!

797
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:47,120
My enemy dies in my hand!

798
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:49,594
Who the hell are you to kill him?

799
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:08,240
Brother!

800
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:39,268
Nothing will happen to you.
- Take him to the lCU.

801
01:19:40,113 --> 01:19:42,104
Ajay needs immediate operation,
very critical position,

802
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:43,214
his pulse rate is going down.

803
01:19:43,215 --> 01:19:44,873
It'll take an hour for the
surgeon to reach hospital.

804
01:19:44,874 --> 01:19:45,704
I'm also a surgeon.

805
01:19:45,705 --> 01:19:47,195
Take him to the operation
theatre immediately.

806
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:49,380
No madam.
- Shift him immediately.

807
01:20:46,379 --> 01:20:53,379
Thanks for the victory you've given
me with love and affection.

808
01:20:56,456 --> 01:20:57,650
Father!

809
01:21:04,864 --> 01:21:06,058
Shall we go to our home?

810
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:12,230
Come here!
- Step mom!

811
01:21:12,972 --> 01:21:15,065
Isn't it enough if people and
your children are with you?

812
01:21:15,475 --> 01:21:18,569
Why do you want to meet her?
Won't you let her also stay with me?

813
01:21:18,745 --> 01:21:25,583
Do you want to take her away
too and leave me alone? Come.

814
01:21:26,486 --> 01:21:28,249
I'll take you to task.

815
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:34,651
Mother, you said he's God to people
and ruined my life as his second wife.

816
01:21:34,827 --> 01:21:37,762
Somehow I'm adjusting but he
insists on living for the people.

817
01:21:37,964 --> 01:21:40,762
He's God to the people
but you see him as demon.

818
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:44,394
Is he refusing to live with you?
My fate!

819
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:50,672
If you go to your brothers,
I'll break your legs, stay in room.

820
01:21:54,914 --> 01:22:01,914
Sister... sister... come... come...
Come fast.

821
01:22:36,055 --> 01:22:40,617
We distributed money, saris,
and liquor too.

822
01:22:41,094 --> 01:22:44,257
Yet we lost again.

823
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:51,464
Surya Pratap Naidu is honest leader,
we can't win till he's alive.

824
01:22:52,772 --> 01:22:56,674
People love him.
- He loves his daughter.

825
01:22:57,176 --> 01:23:01,112
Today is his daughter's birthday.
They're feeding poor in the temple.

826
01:23:02,615 --> 01:23:06,984
Let's also go.
Offer a garland and greet him.

827
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:13,652
All of you must have food and go.
- Greetings.

828
01:23:15,294 --> 01:23:18,457
What should I do to
make them greet me, father?

829
01:23:18,564 --> 01:23:22,193
Feed them and stand by them
through thick and thin.

830
01:23:41,554 --> 01:23:45,388
God gave you victory and defeat to me,

831
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:48,856
that's why I'm here to honour you
in His presence.

832
01:23:54,734 --> 01:23:55,564
Father!

833
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:25,627
Father!

834
01:24:29,435 --> 01:24:31,426
The happiness you get for living
for the people,

835
01:24:33,606 --> 01:24:40,606
you get the same happiness
in dying for them.

836
01:24:42,515 --> 01:24:49,182
Keep an eye on the people and your sister.

837
01:24:49,355 --> 01:24:50,686
As you say father.

838
01:24:51,157 --> 01:24:53,523
I'll take care of step mom
as my own mother.

839
01:24:53,926 --> 01:24:56,520
I'll take care of Sathya as my own sister.

840
01:24:57,063 --> 01:25:00,931
If anyone troubles the poor,
I'll take them to task.

841
01:25:04,937 --> 01:25:07,303
Father!

842
01:25:08,741 --> 01:25:10,709
Sister! Come!

843
01:25:11,043 --> 01:25:12,601
I'm scared! I'll not come.

844
01:25:12,778 --> 01:25:14,609
Don't get scared, sister. Come.

845
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:16,270
I'll not come.

846
01:25:18,284 --> 01:25:19,114
Why did you come here?

847
01:25:19,285 --> 01:25:22,379
All I've is you and sister,
please come to the home, step mom.

848
01:25:22,555 --> 01:25:24,955
I left that home when he was alive,
I'll never enter that place again.

849
01:25:25,124 --> 01:25:27,319
The children don't have anyone, please go.

850
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:31,123
What will I do there? He spent all
his ancestral property for the people.

851
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:32,797
They're left with their mother's property,

852
01:25:32,965 --> 01:25:34,489
it belongs to them,

853
01:25:34,667 --> 01:25:36,658
do you want me to live on the
crumbs given by the kids?

854
01:25:36,836 --> 01:25:37,666
Go away boys!

855
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:45,502
Step mom... we've brought
the documents, take it.

856
01:25:45,678 --> 01:25:46,838
We don't want anything.

857
01:25:46,913 --> 01:25:48,273
It's enough if you and sister stay with s.

858
01:25:48,347 --> 01:25:49,507
Take it, step mom.

859
01:25:49,682 --> 01:25:52,150
Accept it, they're asking with affection.

860
01:25:52,318 --> 01:25:57,483
You shut up, people may accuse me
of usurping step sons' property.

861
01:25:57,823 --> 01:26:01,418
Will you go away or want me
and her to die under the train?

862
01:26:02,395 --> 01:26:04,659
No need step mom, we'll go away.

863
01:26:05,898 --> 01:26:06,887
Brother!

864
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,291
Sister! Tell your mom
and stay with us.

865
01:26:10,436 --> 01:26:12,301
Then promise not to beat anyone.

866
01:26:12,438 --> 01:26:15,305
If so, I'll come here
every summer holidays.

867
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:22,206
As promised to you I'll not beat
anyone without valid reason.

868
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:31,886
You never cared your brother even
as human when he was with us.

869
01:26:32,558 --> 01:26:39,555
But to save him, you've take to
surgeon gloves after years.

870
01:26:39,932 --> 01:26:42,400
It may be your duty as
a doctor to save a life.

871
01:26:42,568 --> 01:26:45,969
But it's not justice to hide truth
from your husband.

872
01:26:47,306 --> 01:26:51,970
When my son proposed to you,
on asking about your parents,

873
01:26:52,144 --> 01:26:53,304
you said you don't have anyone,

874
01:26:53,479 --> 01:26:57,916
now you're crying for him,
why didn't you tell you've a brother?

875
01:27:02,321 --> 01:27:07,156
Deva who became your guard for
his sister and her family,

876
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:08,458
do you know who is he?

877
01:27:09,028 --> 01:27:12,930
There are Gods to the world and
there are Gods to regions too,

878
01:27:13,466 --> 01:27:16,924
but he's God to the region
of Sadashivapuram.

879
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:21,562
Not a God to grant boons but
a God who will give his life for them.

880
01:27:21,774 --> 01:27:24,572
If a necessity arises,
a God who will take lives too.

881
01:27:24,777 --> 01:27:25,675
Sir, he is...

882
01:27:26,512 --> 01:27:32,508
Veera Venkata Sathyanarayana,
a prince without crown,

883
01:27:33,252 --> 01:27:38,246
a king who never sits on throne,
emperor in character,

884
01:27:40,259 --> 01:27:47,097
like a rupee coin has two sides,
if Veera represents the good,

885
01:27:47,266 --> 01:27:49,996
there are katama Naidu and
Rudrama Naidu who represent bad.

886
01:27:50,102 --> 01:27:51,091
Rs. 50 crores?

887
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:52,897
Why so much money to do a good thing?

888
01:27:53,072 --> 01:27:54,403
Veera will stop it.

889
01:27:54,573 --> 01:27:57,440
Veera will never stop anything
that's good for people.

890
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:00,875
It's useful to people but
we've to displace them from there.

891
01:28:05,618 --> 01:28:10,112
This is your Sadashivapuram,
river Godavari runs by the side of it,

892
01:28:11,057 --> 01:28:14,424
if I set up a thermal project here,
half of the place will go.

893
01:28:14,593 --> 01:28:16,117
River too will get polluted.

894
01:28:16,295 --> 01:28:19,753
Moreover cultivation lands
will get destroyed.

895
01:28:19,932 --> 01:28:21,490
So Veera will stop the project.

896
01:28:21,667 --> 01:28:25,330
Veera loves the place more
than his parents.

897
01:28:26,005 --> 01:28:30,101
We want to see the place without Veera,
so we accept the deal.

898
01:28:31,844 --> 01:28:33,607
Please eat son.

899
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:47,315
Are you blind?
How dare you ruin the food?

900
01:28:47,526 --> 01:28:49,824
You'll never come good in life.
You'll get ruined.

901
01:28:49,995 --> 01:28:51,519
Bloody!

902
01:28:52,631 --> 01:28:53,689
What the hell you said now?

903
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:57,695
Poor people have mouth to eat only.
Not to abuse!

904
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:08,874
Go man go...
how dare you kick a woman!

905
01:29:09,048 --> 01:29:13,041
Our Veera is the voice and
heart of we poor people!

906
01:29:13,219 --> 01:29:15,380
I'll see how you can cross the village.

907
01:30:56,922 --> 01:30:58,787
Do you know who am I?

908
01:31:01,293 --> 01:31:03,955
There's no business we've not entered
or factory we haven't put up.

909
01:31:04,129 --> 01:31:09,829
You gave your address too, if I miss
you here I can come for you.

910
01:31:11,003 --> 01:31:13,096
What? Will you beat me?

911
01:31:13,305 --> 01:31:16,331
I've promised not to beat anyone
without a valid reason.

912
01:31:16,509 --> 01:31:20,775
I've promised my father to rip out
skin of anyone who troubles my people.

913
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,944
I'll settle for the second.
- Is it?

914
01:31:24,517 --> 01:31:25,814
Have you seen the people behind me?

915
01:31:25,985 --> 01:31:29,580
If you want to fight me,
you need 100 people behind you,

916
01:31:30,422 --> 01:31:34,859
if I want to fight with you,
you need 100 people before you.

917
01:31:34,994 --> 01:31:37,986
They're not my support,
if you know who they are...

918
01:31:45,204 --> 01:31:49,197
You don't know the value of mother and
food, how can you know value of people?

919
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:54,369
Who told you to destroy homes and
agriculture lands to build factories?

920
01:31:54,547 --> 01:31:56,708
Who are you to stop me?
Is this place your father's property?

921
01:31:56,882 --> 01:31:58,873
If not is it your father's property?

922
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,051
If I beat you, it'll be different,

923
01:32:03,589 --> 01:32:06,057
you want to move but you can't,

924
01:32:06,659 --> 01:32:09,423
you want to pick the knife but you can't,

925
01:32:10,029 --> 01:32:14,966
you may be surprized you're alive
but unable to move,

926
01:32:15,434 --> 01:32:19,131
then you'll understand that
you're a living dead man.

927
01:32:19,572 --> 01:32:22,973
If it happens again, you'll bleed!

928
01:32:57,977 --> 01:33:04,977
Stop... stop... please eat dear...

929
01:33:07,252 --> 01:33:07,741
Father!

930
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,115
I don't have anymore patience.

931
01:33:10,856 --> 01:33:14,952
Trouble with me is inviting trouble
with Arasavelli Suri.

932
01:33:15,794 --> 01:33:21,255
I've asked you to sign these papers,
why are you hesitating?

933
01:33:22,234 --> 01:33:23,963
It's Rs. 10 crore worth property.

934
01:33:24,169 --> 01:33:27,297
You want it for Rs. 10 lakhs,
this is unfair.

935
01:33:28,674 --> 01:33:33,441
Is Rs. 10 crores more than your life?
Tell me.

936
01:33:33,612 --> 01:33:35,603
It's not so easy to take life.

937
01:33:39,718 --> 01:33:41,379
How dare you go against Ammi!

938
01:33:41,887 --> 01:33:47,757
To take life a goat and human are same.

939
01:33:50,262 --> 01:33:57,262
If you'd signed it earlier, the goat
would've lived for few more days. Go!

940
01:34:14,153 --> 01:34:16,314
My husband is great man!

941
01:34:16,989 --> 01:34:20,481
Sister!
- Is your job done?

942
01:34:20,659 --> 01:34:22,490
Sister, Veera...

943
01:34:23,395 --> 01:34:27,092
Does he know you're my brother?
- He knows sister.

944
01:34:27,599 --> 01:34:29,362
Does he know you're his brother-in-law?

945
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:32,095
Sister, if he your brother, then he's
his brother-in-law, right?

946
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:42,044
I asked for confirmation.
Got his throat cut, bloody fool!

947
01:34:43,515 --> 01:34:50,515
He has bloodied my brothers' faces.
I must see happiness in their eyes.

948
01:34:51,457 --> 01:34:54,893
Husband!
- There's a time for everything.

949
01:34:55,694 --> 01:34:59,061
I'll ensure the land you
want becomes yours.

950
01:34:59,531 --> 01:35:02,694
If anyone stops me,
I'll crush him to death.

951
01:35:03,702 --> 01:35:08,799
I'm eyeing the lands of Sadashivapuram.

952
01:35:12,644 --> 01:35:15,408
Call from sister Sathya.
- Call from sister!

953
01:35:15,581 --> 01:35:17,981
I'll talk to her!

954
01:35:20,519 --> 01:35:23,784
Just for fun, first you
and then me, brother.

955
01:35:24,256 --> 01:35:25,416
Speak.
- Tell me dear.

956
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:27,258
Have you brought Chitti into line?

957
01:35:27,426 --> 01:35:29,587
Chitti, she's playing kabaddi with me.

958
01:35:29,795 --> 01:35:32,025
It's not easy to make a woman fall for you.

959
01:35:32,197 --> 01:35:33,960
I'll pin down anyone in wrestling.

960
01:35:34,133 --> 01:35:36,533
Wrestling is different and
dating woman is different.

961
01:35:36,735 --> 01:35:39,761
Okay, I'll dictate love letter,
take it down.

962
01:35:40,072 --> 01:35:42,233
Give it to her with a rose
when she's alone.

963
01:35:42,441 --> 01:35:45,069
Why rose?
- It's a love symbol, brother.

964
01:35:46,879 --> 01:35:47,436
I'm here!

965
01:35:47,579 --> 01:35:50,013
Sister is dictating love letter,
take it down.

966
01:35:50,182 --> 01:35:52,582
Kabaddi Chitti will come to me
on reading it.

967
01:35:52,785 --> 01:35:54,946
Is it? Give me.
- Listen properly.

968
01:35:55,087 --> 01:35:57,817
Tell me sister.
- Don't miss even a word.

969
01:35:57,956 --> 01:36:00,584
No away, I'll do it perfectly.
- Write.

970
01:36:00,826 --> 01:36:01,588
Tell me.

971
01:36:02,127 --> 01:36:07,827
Ladies and gentlemen, today is
ladies women kabaddi finals.

972
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,299
Hey, ladies and women are same,
say properly.

973
01:36:11,503 --> 01:36:11,992
Really?

974
01:36:12,137 --> 01:36:17,769
The finals is between Sadashivapuram
and Seethanagaram teams.

975
01:36:17,943 --> 01:36:20,935
Our Veera is the chief guest!

976
01:36:28,053 --> 01:36:30,283
It's three days since I saw her,
where's my lady player?

977
01:36:30,455 --> 01:36:31,581
Lady player? Who is she?

978
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:35,790
Look there!
Sensational introduction.

979
01:36:45,637 --> 01:36:47,832
What a pose!

980
01:36:54,213 --> 01:36:57,341
What is Chitti saying?
- Kabaddi. . kabaddi...

981
01:36:57,516 --> 01:37:00,314
Why am I hearing it as Veera?

982
01:37:00,819 --> 01:37:03,982
What should've happened on time
if it had happened, you won't react like this.

983
01:37:04,156 --> 01:37:05,953
That's why you should...
- Shut up.

984
01:37:44,763 --> 01:37:46,060
Claps...

985
01:37:46,565 --> 01:37:51,559
Chitti! If you lose, it means
Sadashivapuram has lost.

986
01:37:53,906 --> 01:37:56,397
With every cry, bang them!

987
01:37:58,577 --> 01:38:01,410
Throw challenge! Challenge openly!

988
01:38:54,933 --> 01:38:59,836
O my dear, I'm very happy...
You looking at me this moment...

989
01:38:59,972 --> 01:39:04,602
Pulling my heart towards you...

990
01:39:04,776 --> 01:39:07,108
O my dear, I'm very happy...

991
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:12,615
Giving me a place in your
heart this moment...

992
01:39:12,784 --> 01:39:15,116
I'm impressed with myself...

993
01:39:19,725 --> 01:39:23,786
Oh what's this happiness!

994
01:39:23,962 --> 01:39:28,956
Not letting me to sit or stand,
what's this?

995
01:39:29,735 --> 01:39:33,933
Oh my God! I'm feeling strange...

996
01:39:34,106 --> 01:39:39,169
All this chaos in me is
your creation my dear...

997
01:39:40,512 --> 01:39:45,142
You appear in the mirror of my heart...

998
01:39:45,417 --> 01:39:49,979
And driving me crazy, my love...

999
01:39:50,322 --> 01:39:57,194
Wherever I may go, it's you everywhere..

1000
01:39:57,362 --> 01:40:00,195
Why do you confuse me always...

1001
01:40:30,695 --> 01:40:34,927
It's new experience...
love is pinching..

1002
01:40:35,734 --> 01:40:37,565
It's warm...

1003
01:40:40,906 --> 01:40:45,240
There's great intoxication
in the myth of love...

1004
01:40:49,748 --> 01:40:54,583
My lips are lucky to pout...
My eyes are lucky to dream...

1005
01:40:54,753 --> 01:40:59,588
This lifelong happiness is boon from you...

1006
01:40:59,758 --> 01:41:04,593
My feet follow you...
I can't live without you...

1007
01:41:04,763 --> 01:41:09,598
My every thought is about you only...

1008
01:41:09,734 --> 01:41:14,899
It's all because of you
this magical charm...

1009
01:41:15,107 --> 01:41:19,601
I liked you at first sight...
You barged into my heart...

1010
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:24,738
It's all because of you
this blissful trance...

1011
01:41:24,916 --> 01:41:30,115
O beautiful bud...
My youth is doing a somersault...

1012
01:41:58,450 --> 01:42:03,285
My body is feeling the burden...
My walking speed has raised...

1013
01:42:03,455 --> 01:42:08,324
Heart is sending message to heart...

1014
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:13,329
My youth is in bliss...
My shyness has vanished...

1015
01:42:13,498 --> 01:42:18,333
What's this chemistry between bodies?

1016
01:42:18,503 --> 01:42:23,338
It's all because of you
this wonder has happened...

1017
01:42:23,508 --> 01:42:25,999
When I get you, I'll be the luckiest man...

1018
01:42:26,178 --> 01:42:28,510
I'll walk to holy Seven Hills
to fulfill vow...

1019
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:33,481
It's all because of you I'm crazy...

1020
01:42:33,652 --> 01:42:35,813
Dusky eyes beauty, tie the knot with me...

1021
01:42:35,987 --> 01:42:38,751
I can't say anything more than this...

1022
01:43:04,816 --> 01:43:05,805
Who is it?

1023
01:43:05,951 --> 01:43:09,216
I'm Seekakulam Seetha,
please give the phone to Veera.

1024
01:43:09,387 --> 01:43:11,378
To Veera? Hold on.

1025
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:13,857
You're yearning for Chitti,

1026
01:43:14,025 --> 01:43:16,084
but some Seetha from Seekakulam
wants to talk to you,

1027
01:43:16,294 --> 01:43:19,286
take her to task.

1028
01:43:19,864 --> 01:43:20,728
Who is it?

1029
01:43:20,865 --> 01:43:23,891
In the recent kabaddi game, I saw your
strong body and fell for it.

1030
01:43:24,035 --> 01:43:25,559
Look Geetha.
- No Seetha.

1031
01:43:25,737 --> 01:43:28,137
Okay, you don't have any chance.

1032
01:43:28,306 --> 01:43:30,900
Only Chitti has all rights
on me and my body.

1033
01:43:31,076 --> 01:43:32,236
Why are you saying like that?

1034
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:35,072
I'm telling you again,
why not think over it again?

1035
01:43:35,247 --> 01:43:36,805
If Chitti comes to know about this,

1036
01:43:36,982 --> 01:43:39,075
she'll come there and
play kabaddi with your life.

1037
01:43:39,251 --> 01:43:40,240
Cut the line.

1038
01:43:40,752 --> 01:43:42,413
Some girl is proposing to me.

1039
01:43:42,587 --> 01:43:45,078
Why didn't you tell my name?
I'm free I'd have gone to Seekakulam.

1040
01:43:45,290 --> 01:43:46,484
Go, it's wrong.

1041
01:43:46,658 --> 01:43:47,920
Dear!

1042
01:43:49,661 --> 01:43:51,822
Here she comes!
Have you come, Chitti?

1043
01:43:51,997 --> 01:43:53,624
I brought the love letter.
Where is Veera?

1044
01:43:54,699 --> 01:43:56,667
Love letter?
Really?

1045
01:43:57,035 --> 01:43:58,133
Would you like me to read for you?

1046
01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:00,128
My freest Chitti,

1047
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:04,500
I love you since you
were wearing small gowns, so...

1048
01:44:04,676 --> 01:44:06,837
You know it by heart,
did you like it so much?

1049
01:44:07,379 --> 01:44:12,681
What's this freest? It's dearest!

1050
01:44:12,951 --> 01:44:14,578
You told me to write freely, that's why...

1051
01:44:14,786 --> 01:44:16,947
He says he wrote it,
did he keep his finger in it?

1052
01:44:17,088 --> 01:44:18,851
Not just finger, I've put my leg too.

1053
01:44:19,024 --> 01:44:22,016
What else you've put?
- A lot many!

1054
01:44:23,194 --> 01:44:25,958
My doors of my hearts will
always be open for you.

1055
01:44:26,197 --> 01:44:27,186
Hearts?!

1056
01:44:27,565 --> 01:44:28,964
I think it's door of heart.

1057
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:32,092
Aren't you as smart as the cook too?
Watch the next line.

1058
01:44:32,771 --> 01:44:35,638
Holding the milk galas...
- It's milk glass.

1059
01:44:37,142 --> 01:44:39,770
When you walk in wearing white sari,

1060
01:44:39,944 --> 01:44:43,107
I feel like disrobing you...

1061
01:44:43,782 --> 01:44:45,272
Do you've such nasty wishes too?

1062
01:44:46,551 --> 01:44:48,280
What did my sister tell
and what have you written?

1063
01:44:48,453 --> 01:44:49,713
Who told you to write all this nonsense?

1064
01:44:49,788 --> 01:44:52,450
To make an impact I wrote it on my own.

1065
01:44:52,624 --> 01:44:56,060
So the idea was your sister's,
and this fool wrote it.

1066
01:44:56,294 --> 01:44:57,420
Why should I love you?

1067
01:44:59,064 --> 01:45:01,055
How was my letter?
- Get lost!

1068
01:45:05,503 --> 01:45:07,334
Where did you pick up so much literature?

1069
01:45:07,505 --> 01:45:09,666
If I gulp a quarter, poetry will ooze out.

1070
01:45:09,841 --> 01:45:11,172
How would it be if I slap you?

1071
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:15,340
Why are you watching like fools?
- He may beat again.

1072
01:45:25,423 --> 01:45:26,515
Shower with flowers?

1073
01:45:27,926 --> 01:45:28,517
Wait.

1074
01:45:54,986 --> 01:45:56,749
I'm telling you without
other's idea or help.

1075
01:45:58,423 --> 01:45:59,583
Did you call me here for this?

1076
01:45:59,724 --> 01:46:02,090
Is it really your idea?
- I swear it's mine.

1077
01:46:03,261 --> 01:46:05,786
At least hug me once!

1078
01:46:10,068 --> 01:46:10,727
What's this?

1079
01:46:11,569 --> 01:46:14,129
Angels are welcoming our love
by showering with flowers.

1080
01:46:14,272 --> 01:46:15,739
You must show mercy on me now.

1081
01:46:16,307 --> 01:46:18,298
Really?
- I swear on your hug.

1082
01:46:18,643 --> 01:46:19,473
Then hug me.

1083
01:46:39,063 --> 01:46:40,087
I slipped.

1084
01:46:40,632 --> 01:46:41,462
Hug program is cancelled.

1085
01:46:41,633 --> 01:46:43,567
You know to grow moustache but not to love.

1086
01:46:45,503 --> 01:46:47,095
Stop... stop...

1087
01:46:48,373 --> 01:46:52,400
It's me Seekakulam Seetha!
What have you decided about me?

1088
01:46:52,577 --> 01:46:55,910
She's rejecting you,
why are you still after her?

1089
01:46:56,214 --> 01:46:58,273
Why don't you come to me?

1090
01:46:58,416 --> 01:47:01,112
Seetha, I beg you.
Please leave me alone.

1091
01:47:01,419 --> 01:47:04,684
I may give you green signal
talking to you every day.

1092
01:47:05,423 --> 01:47:08,620
I'm already married.
Chitti is my wife.

1093
01:47:08,793 --> 01:47:11,626
Your wife?
What's this strange?

1094
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:14,355
Why are you after wife expressing love?

1095
01:47:14,632 --> 01:47:16,429
What am I to say?
How much I must say?

1096
01:47:16,634 --> 01:47:19,467
It's a strange and unusual
story and a painful one too.

1097
01:47:25,877 --> 01:47:27,777
I'm tensed.
- Why are you tensed?

1098
01:47:27,946 --> 01:47:29,538
This is my first time first night.

1099
01:47:29,714 --> 01:47:31,875
On one side happiness and another side you.

1100
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:33,950
Seeing all this appears like a dream.

1101
01:47:34,118 --> 01:47:36,780
I'll give whatever you may
ask tonight, sit here.

1102
01:47:37,789 --> 01:47:38,448
Love!

1103
01:47:39,057 --> 01:47:42,288
I'll give in tonnes.
Don't waste time.

1104
01:47:42,827 --> 01:47:44,454
Will you give really?
- I swear on you.

1105
01:47:44,662 --> 01:47:45,959
Come, let's play kabaddi.

1106
01:47:46,397 --> 01:47:47,486
What happened now?
- I'll not come.

1107
01:47:47,665 --> 01:47:49,997
My dream was someone
should love and marry me.

1108
01:47:50,168 --> 01:47:53,160
That's all? We're married,
we can love all the life.

1109
01:47:54,372 --> 01:47:56,499
First make love bloom here,
only then honeymoon.

1110
01:47:56,674 --> 01:47:58,665
How to make love bloom?

1111
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:02,343
To make love bloom in my heart,
groups of pigeons must come down,

1112
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:05,342
lightning must shatter the sky,
earth must shiver with quakes.

1113
01:48:05,517 --> 01:48:05,983
Earth quake?

1114
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:09,483
And all this must happen immediately
after you say I love you.

1115
01:48:09,654 --> 01:48:11,713
You want it to happen?
Our honeymoon will never happen.

1116
01:48:12,156 --> 01:48:13,248
I'll punch you.

1117
01:48:13,491 --> 01:48:15,686
Till all that happens,
honeymoon is cancelled.

1118
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:16,918
This is injustice.

1119
01:48:17,762 --> 01:48:20,026
Promise me not to tell anyone about this.

1120
01:48:21,065 --> 01:48:22,032
Promise.

1121
01:48:27,872 --> 01:48:31,535
Tell me now, will you call me again?
Never again call me, right?

1122
01:48:36,114 --> 01:48:38,878
Everyone is getting ready,
when will she get ready?

1123
01:48:39,050 --> 01:48:41,712
You promised not to tell anyone
but told her everything.

1124
01:48:42,887 --> 01:48:43,876
I'll take you to task.

1125
01:48:45,123 --> 01:48:48,024
Drink it!
- I'll not touch.

1126
01:48:48,192 --> 01:48:50,717
If you drink this
and beat Chitti, she'll agree.

1127
01:48:50,895 --> 01:48:52,192
She's not agreeing.

1128
01:48:52,430 --> 01:48:55,058
Why are you cribbing like Chinarayudu?
- What's that?

1129
01:48:55,266 --> 01:48:57,234
Didn't get me, right?
I'll tell you.

1130
01:48:58,303 --> 01:49:00,066
What's this?
You want me to kill her!

1131
01:49:01,372 --> 01:49:05,308
You don't drink this, right?
Put an hole to the coconut.

1132
01:49:06,578 --> 01:49:09,240
Pour this into it.

1133
01:49:11,049 --> 01:49:13,574
Add a dash of lemon, it'll be great!

1134
01:49:13,751 --> 01:49:14,911
Is it necessary now?

1135
01:49:15,086 --> 01:49:17,919
If not you can't have her.
- Why do I need this?

1136
01:49:18,256 --> 01:49:19,951
Rape!
- Rape?

1137
01:49:20,158 --> 01:49:21,420
It's wrong, it's sin.

1138
01:49:21,626 --> 01:49:26,256
It's wrong if you do it,
not under influence of liquor.

1139
01:49:26,431 --> 01:49:27,420
Drink it, brother.

1140
01:49:32,403 --> 01:49:33,097
Have another!

1141
01:49:34,172 --> 01:49:35,230
Give me another.

1142
01:49:38,009 --> 01:49:39,442
Put the hole.
- Pour liquor.

1143
01:49:39,611 --> 01:49:40,236
I have.

1144
01:49:40,445 --> 01:49:42,970
Add lemon.
- I have.

1145
01:49:43,748 --> 01:49:45,238
Tonight I'll rape her.

1146
01:49:46,017 --> 01:49:49,851
I didn't made you drink to do
it tomorrow, rape tonight.

1147
01:49:50,021 --> 01:49:51,648
Then, give me two more!
- What two?

1148
01:49:51,756 --> 01:49:53,121
One for me and one for my Chitti.

1149
01:49:54,192 --> 01:49:57,787
You're one amongst now!
Take these two and have a blast!

1150
01:49:57,962 --> 01:49:58,792
Take it.

1151
01:50:07,805 --> 01:50:12,765
She must be sleeping with me,
look, how she's sleeping alone?

1152
01:50:12,944 --> 01:50:16,937
Not alone but fully covered.
- The liquor is working.

1153
01:50:18,249 --> 01:50:21,377
Shall I get into her bed?
- No, she'll raise alarm.

1154
01:50:21,753 --> 01:50:24,119
Cover and take her to farm,
have a blast there.

1155
01:50:24,622 --> 01:50:27,557
What do you mean by blast?
I don't know.

1156
01:50:27,825 --> 01:50:30,293
Can I dig bore there?
- As many times as you wish to.

1157
01:50:30,461 --> 01:50:32,019
I want that.

1158
01:50:43,341 --> 01:50:45,434
Not here.
May scratch in the farm.

1159
01:51:06,164 --> 01:51:10,498
She appears thin like Aishwarya Rai
but heavy like kalpana Rai to carry.

1160
01:51:10,668 --> 01:51:13,535
Don't shout, she may wake up.

1161
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:16,470
Even if she shouts, would I stop?

1162
01:51:16,541 --> 01:51:18,202
You carry on.
- Keep watch.

1163
01:51:18,376 --> 01:51:20,207
What now?
- Coconut.

1164
01:51:20,445 --> 01:51:21,036
Forgot it.

1165
01:51:21,946 --> 01:51:24,039
What should've happened on bed of flowers?

1166
01:51:24,215 --> 01:51:29,380
I had to make it on farm bunds.
Tonight I'll shake you up!

1167
01:51:29,554 --> 01:51:33,251
Do you want love?
Isn't this love?

1168
01:51:34,892 --> 01:51:37,793
By now Chitti would've drunk
the coconut water.

1169
01:51:40,231 --> 01:51:43,689
Coconut water!
Have it!

1170
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:01,742
Why is he shouting instead of Chitti?

1171
01:52:01,919 --> 01:52:03,910
What would've happened?
What happened?

1172
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:09,588
Bloody!

1173
01:52:10,161 --> 01:52:12,595
If you'd shown the same
courage with Chitti,

1174
01:52:12,797 --> 01:52:15,925
I would be playing with
3 sets of twins by now.

1175
01:52:21,005 --> 01:52:24,236
I think it's not good to
keep husband away from bed.

1176
01:52:24,442 --> 01:52:28,071
Even if he's husband,
how can I make love without love?

1177
01:52:28,246 --> 01:52:30,441
Love must blossom and I must win.

1178
01:52:30,581 --> 01:52:32,515
What if you lose?
- Impossible.

1179
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:37,250
If love fails to blossom
between us, I'll wither like flower!

1180
01:52:37,455 --> 01:52:41,448
You wait for love and some girl
will take away Veera from you.

1181
01:52:41,592 --> 01:52:43,992
Then you'll lose him.
- I'll kill her.

1182
01:52:44,128 --> 01:52:44,594
How?

1183
01:52:44,829 --> 01:52:48,822
I've kept the sickle sharpened!
- I'll not accept.

1184
01:52:49,133 --> 01:52:53,297
There's no man on earth to win
over Chitti in kabaddi.

1185
01:52:53,704 --> 01:52:56,832
Brother says, he'll win over her.
He says kabaddi is silly game.

1186
01:53:00,778 --> 01:53:02,439
Who said that?
- Brother Veera!

1187
01:53:02,613 --> 01:53:07,277
It seems you pinch, nip, clip to
win the game. He says it's easy.

1188
01:53:07,552 --> 01:53:08,450
Did he say like that?

1189
01:53:08,619 --> 01:53:12,953
He did say, if you've guts
play with him. He must lose.

1190
01:53:14,458 --> 01:53:17,621
I accept the challenge, any place will do,

1191
01:53:17,795 --> 01:53:21,162
anytime will do, be it ground or sand dune,

1192
01:53:21,332 --> 01:53:23,800
tell him, I'll win with
my strength not the game.

1193
01:53:38,115 --> 01:53:40,083
Will you start the attack or shall I?

1194
01:53:40,218 --> 01:53:45,155
You're junior, first you.
- Toss will decide it.

1195
01:53:45,323 --> 01:53:47,655
Head or tail?
- Always head.

1196
01:53:50,494 --> 01:53:51,017
Head!

1197
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:54,662
Attack or defend?
- I'll attack first.

1198
01:54:05,443 --> 01:54:06,876
How come flowers moved in her direction?

1199
01:54:07,044 --> 01:54:08,534
You've done, flowers are nothing.

1200
01:54:08,713 --> 01:54:10,704
Sun is that side, right?
- Chitti is here. - That side?

1201
01:54:12,383 --> 01:54:13,441
Will you start the attack?

1202
01:54:23,861 --> 01:54:24,691
Will you come?

1203
01:54:24,862 --> 01:54:27,057
Don't push me, I'm new to the game.

1204
01:54:28,232 --> 01:54:30,700
Don't talk like a boy,
you threw the challenge.

1205
01:54:30,868 --> 01:54:32,301
If you don't cross this lifeline,

1206
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:35,303
you'll never down your brief
and I'll never drop my sari down.

1207
01:54:35,473 --> 01:54:38,567
She has thrown one more challenge.
Okay, be alert!

1208
01:55:04,669 --> 01:55:06,330
She's playing on his weakness,
how can he win?

1209
01:55:06,504 --> 01:55:08,563
You fool!
Nobody loses in this game.

1210
01:55:08,873 --> 01:55:13,105
Both will be victors. No need of
spoilsports here, let's go.

1211
01:55:13,277 --> 01:55:13,902
Let's go.

1212
01:55:14,111 --> 01:55:15,571
Why are you leaving without
watching the game?

1213
01:55:15,613 --> 01:55:17,574
This is adults only game,
children are not allowed to watch.

1214
01:55:17,782 --> 01:55:19,272
It's blooming flowers in garden!

1215
01:55:22,186 --> 01:55:25,121
No need of others,
let's play between us. Come.

1216
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:31,711
On giving fruit near the mango farm...

1217
01:56:32,256 --> 01:56:35,282
Visiting often to give sweets...

1218
01:56:40,731 --> 01:56:43,529
By hook or by crook...
He squeezed me, O my Veera...

1219
01:56:43,701 --> 01:56:47,364
He dishonoured me in daylight...

1220
01:56:52,777 --> 01:56:55,302
If you let me into the orange farm...

1221
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:59,042
If you let the betel leaf
and calcium mix...

1222
01:57:04,789 --> 01:57:08,691
Why don't you kiss me?

1223
01:57:08,859 --> 01:57:11,384
O kabaddi girl,
why don't you fulfill my wish?

1224
01:57:50,334 --> 01:57:52,894
You've hidden the treasures of beauty...

1225
01:57:53,737 --> 01:57:56,604
O darling, I can't hold on myself...

1226
01:57:57,608 --> 01:58:00,099
You're my perfect match
in height and weight...

1227
01:58:01,011 --> 01:58:05,107
O dear, I'm down with your swine flu...

1228
01:58:07,518 --> 01:58:11,921
When the time comes, I'll make vows...

1229
01:58:12,156 --> 01:58:16,923
When dreams come true,
I'll fulfill my vows..

1230
01:58:17,161 --> 01:58:24,161
I'll give my love, my soul and my body...

1231
01:58:26,504 --> 01:58:28,972
What trick has he played on me...
He swept me off my feet...

1232
01:58:43,621 --> 01:58:48,115
O Veera...
Your eyes are magnetic...

1233
01:58:48,425 --> 01:58:50,791
Handsome and energetic man...

1234
01:58:50,961 --> 01:58:52,952
If you call me I'll come
to any place any time...

1235
01:58:53,130 --> 01:59:00,130
O Veera...

1236
01:59:12,016 --> 01:59:14,644
O macho man!
Come to the mango grove...

1237
01:59:15,586 --> 01:59:18,146
Count the moles on me...

1238
01:59:19,156 --> 01:59:22,353
Lit fire on all moles...

1239
01:59:22,493 --> 01:59:26,361
Put your finger into the
anthill and sting me...

1240
01:59:26,530 --> 01:59:31,160
Do you want a special
invitation for the game?

1241
01:59:31,368 --> 01:59:33,700
I don't like the game played in open...

1242
01:59:33,871 --> 01:59:38,365
If my pulse races, you'll stand to lose...

1243
01:59:38,542 --> 01:59:43,377
Accept with respect,
isn't it okay to commit the sin?

1244
02:00:47,845 --> 02:00:48,777
Bye.

1245
02:00:56,687 --> 02:00:58,177
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1246
02:00:58,355 --> 02:01:01,791
I'm Peda Venkatrayudu.
I'm here to discuss with you.

1247
02:01:10,834 --> 02:01:12,893
Tell me.
- I'm a business man.

1248
02:01:13,103 --> 02:01:15,503
Buying and selling lands is my profession.

1249
02:01:15,639 --> 02:01:21,441
It's my habit to take what I want
and give what others want.

1250
02:01:21,779 --> 02:01:24,213
I want lands in your place.

1251
02:01:25,215 --> 02:01:31,120
It seems your word is the rule here.
Tell them to sell their land to me.

1252
02:01:31,655 --> 02:01:33,714
I'll throw money on their faces.

1253
02:01:33,891 --> 02:01:37,292
You heard that my word is the rule here,

1254
02:01:37,661 --> 02:01:40,755
I'm sure you would've heard the
first two letters of my name also.

1255
02:01:41,131 --> 02:01:45,295
Veera! I'm modest!

1256
02:01:45,502 --> 02:01:48,494
You've come to me,
so you'll me as modest only.

1257
02:01:49,773 --> 02:01:54,506
I'm evil too!
Don't wish to see my that side.

1258
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:59,171
Before I get angry for
your idiotic approach,

1259
02:01:59,350 --> 02:02:01,978
it's safe for you all to
leave the place immediately.

1260
02:02:02,152 --> 02:02:05,588
If anyone refuses me after I ask,

1261
02:02:05,723 --> 02:02:09,989
I'll take what I want and though
he doesn't want I'll give by force,

1262
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:11,991
that's my bad habit,

1263
02:02:13,163 --> 02:02:17,429
if I decide I can drive you
out of your place.

1264
02:02:17,968 --> 02:02:24,532
Stake! 500 acres of fertile lands,
my palatial house in 5 acres,

1265
02:02:24,708 --> 02:02:29,042
affection of lakhs of people,
I'll stake it,

1266
02:02:29,213 --> 02:02:31,044
choose whatever you want to stake,

1267
02:02:31,215 --> 02:02:34,048
let me if you can drive me out of my place,

1268
02:02:34,218 --> 02:02:37,710
or else you and your people would
get displaced because of me,

1269
02:02:38,055 --> 02:02:39,044
let's see!

1270
02:02:39,223 --> 02:02:42,556
Think once again,
enmity with me is dangerous.

1271
02:02:42,926 --> 02:02:47,260
God gives everyone one ton of
patience and 1 kg of madness.

1272
02:02:47,765 --> 02:02:52,134
I've the second one little more.
Play with my patience,

1273
02:02:52,469 --> 02:02:55,961
you'll live, if you play with my madness,

1274
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:58,571
heads will roll down.

1275
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:01,236
Get lost!

1276
02:03:24,568 --> 02:03:27,230
Till now they made us run
with Veera's support.

1277
02:03:27,371 --> 02:03:29,362
Now they're on run.

1278
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:32,400
Till now I was waiting for this day.

1279
02:03:39,016 --> 02:03:40,278
Come.

1280
02:03:40,417 --> 02:03:42,908
Brother-in-law, he's Veera's man.
He's refusing to sign.

1281
02:03:43,187 --> 02:03:48,181
It's not autograph to sign on being asked.

1282
02:03:48,425 --> 02:03:49,790
It's his property.

1283
02:04:04,875 --> 02:04:05,532
What happened, Vamsi?

1284
02:04:05,609 --> 02:04:09,101
Pedarayudu is creating havoc
with his henchmen.

1285
02:04:13,617 --> 02:04:14,606
Stop!

1286
02:04:18,455 --> 02:04:19,615
Brother-in-law, Veera's wife.

1287
02:04:21,058 --> 02:04:25,119
Go away before Veera comes here.

1288
02:04:25,295 --> 02:04:28,287
If your lifeline is strong, you'll live.
- If not?

1289
02:04:28,465 --> 02:04:30,296
All three of would die and
reach the burial ground.

1290
02:04:30,467 --> 02:04:35,769
Excellent! You're Veera's wife, right?
I heard he's mad for people.

1291
02:04:36,507 --> 02:04:37,997
You too are mad!

1292
02:04:38,675 --> 02:04:42,668
I'll go after getting the
signatures of everyone here.

1293
02:04:42,846 --> 02:04:44,336
Boys, get their signatures.

1294
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:49,410
This scared thread was tied by Veera,
I swear on it,

1295
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:52,480
if anyone dares to step forward,
I'll hack them.

1296
02:04:52,656 --> 02:04:55,819
Hack them? Will you hack me?
Hack me!

1297
02:05:04,268 --> 02:05:07,101
Why are you laughing?
- For every slap,

1298
02:05:07,538 --> 02:05:09,472
when my husband takes revenge for it,

1299
02:05:10,307 --> 02:05:13,902
I thought how you would cry,
it made me laugh out loud.

1300
02:05:47,744 --> 02:05:51,805
Without knowing about me or my history,
you beat my people,

1301
02:05:52,416 --> 02:05:54,577
if you've guts, beat me.

1302
02:05:55,419 --> 02:05:57,250
In the witness of the same history,

1303
02:05:57,588 --> 02:05:59,920
shall I beat you so hard
that it'll create history?

1304
02:06:00,090 --> 02:06:02,786
Shall I beat you so hard that
history will remember you?

1305
02:06:09,633 --> 02:06:14,332
I told you earlier, if you come
to me, you'll see my soft side,

1306
02:06:19,509 --> 02:06:24,446
and if I come to you,
you'll see the evil side of me.

1307
02:06:32,856 --> 02:06:34,255
Kill him boys!

1308
02:08:11,955 --> 02:08:13,752
How dare you come to face me!

1309
02:08:14,324 --> 02:08:16,952
You walked in majestically like a man!

1310
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:18,887
You're walking in now head hung in shame.

1311
02:08:19,062 --> 02:08:20,120
Aren't you ashamed?

1312
02:08:23,133 --> 02:08:25,533
If you kill yourself with it,

1313
02:08:25,702 --> 02:08:27,897
I'll wipe my dot and become a widow,

1314
02:08:28,238 --> 02:08:31,571
if you kill me,
I'll as a chaste married woman.

1315
02:08:31,742 --> 02:08:33,471
I underestimated his strength.

1316
02:08:33,643 --> 02:08:40,643
I thought I was living with a man,
wear sari and put on bangles,

1317
02:08:43,587 --> 02:08:49,082
hereafter I'll live with a woman.
- Ammi, I'll not step in,

1318
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:52,328
I'll prove that I'm a man.

1319
02:08:52,662 --> 02:08:53,788
Stop!

1320
02:08:54,865 --> 02:08:59,165
Hang Veera's headless body
in Sadashivapuram,

1321
02:08:59,436 --> 02:09:00,994
bring his head to me,

1322
02:09:01,171 --> 02:09:05,574
I'll cut it into pieces
and feed our dogs. Go!

1323
02:09:19,022 --> 02:09:23,186
Greetings SP sir!
What are you searching?

1324
02:09:24,127 --> 02:09:27,255
Police don't come without any work.
- Call your brother.

1325
02:09:27,464 --> 02:09:31,992
I think you're serious.
Get a juice, please sit SP sir.

1326
02:09:32,135 --> 02:09:35,298
I'm not here to have juice.
Call your brother.

1327
02:09:35,505 --> 02:09:37,496
I'll call, first you...
- Greetings.

1328
02:09:38,008 --> 02:09:39,441
Why did you come without juice?

1329
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:41,208
Why should I bring?

1330
02:09:41,378 --> 02:09:43,141
One who should bring it will come with it.

1331
02:09:46,116 --> 02:09:47,105
Take it sir.

1332
02:09:48,051 --> 02:09:48,949
Take it.

1333
02:09:49,786 --> 02:09:52,348
What would daughter-in-law
of my family call you then?

1334
02:09:52,422 --> 02:09:54,553
Can't she call me as father?
- How can she call you, please tell me?

1335
02:09:54,624 --> 02:09:56,285
My daughter and your brother
love each other,

1336
02:09:56,459 --> 02:09:58,620
fixing their marriage would be fine,
why can't you ask that with me?

1337
02:09:58,795 --> 02:10:00,990
I came to know she loves him just now.

1338
02:10:01,164 --> 02:10:03,325
You've accepted the proposal,
so next is marriage.

1339
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:06,162
Marriage? How is it possible?
- He accepted it, right?

1340
02:10:06,336 --> 02:10:10,670
Who is he to accept? First she must agree.
- Who is she?

1341
02:10:10,841 --> 02:10:12,672
His doting sister.

1342
02:10:12,843 --> 02:10:14,936
You've heard everything, right?
I'm giving the phone to Veera.

1343
02:10:15,846 --> 02:10:17,177
I would've given her the good news, right?

1344
02:10:17,347 --> 02:10:20,111
What if she says how can
brother marry before her?

1345
02:10:20,317 --> 02:10:24,378
Tell me dear.
- Slap him tightly, brother.

1346
02:10:25,655 --> 02:10:28,021
Would I say so?
- I know dear.

1347
02:10:28,158 --> 02:10:31,025
Whenever you're free and decide,
I'll fix their marriage then.

1348
02:10:31,595 --> 02:10:35,361
Come with step mom.
- We're leaving tomorrow.

1349
02:10:35,498 --> 02:10:36,487
I'm very happy.

1350
02:10:40,203 --> 02:10:42,433
I'm so happy to lift you and turn round.

1351
02:10:42,973 --> 02:10:44,440
But...
- I'll punch you.

1352
02:10:44,774 --> 02:10:46,765
It's not love on me.

1353
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:50,373
It's the love for your forthcoming father.

1354
02:10:54,718 --> 02:10:55,548
What?
- What?

1355
02:10:55,719 --> 02:10:57,710
Sister is coming tomorrow,
hide all the weapons.

1356
02:10:57,888 --> 02:10:59,478
She shouldn't even see blade pieces.
- Yes brother.

1357
02:10:59,556 --> 02:11:01,854
Why are you sporting beards?
Shave it, go.

1358
02:11:10,867 --> 02:11:13,700
It's okay to remove the beard
but please don't touch moustache.

1359
02:11:18,575 --> 02:11:21,635
Eons back it seems Pandavas
hid their weapons in tree.

1360
02:11:21,811 --> 02:11:23,904
We're also hiding in coconut tree.

1361
02:11:28,251 --> 02:11:32,244
Forgive me, I'm troubling you
every time sister comes here.

1362
02:11:32,422 --> 02:11:34,754
You've done so much for
this place and it's people,

1363
02:11:34,958 --> 02:11:36,585
can't we do this much for you?

1364
02:11:42,465 --> 02:11:47,493
Will step mom too come with sister?
- Step mom left this place with sister,

1365
02:11:47,671 --> 02:11:50,265
sister came here sometimes
but step mom never came back.

1366
02:11:50,407 --> 02:11:52,341
I don't think she'll come this time too.

1367
02:12:04,387 --> 02:12:06,412
Brother!

1368
02:12:11,594 --> 02:12:13,687
Are you fine, dear?
How is step mom doing?

1369
02:12:19,235 --> 02:12:20,395
Step mom is here!

1370
02:12:24,174 --> 02:12:26,608
I'm very happy that you've come here.

1371
02:12:28,778 --> 02:12:31,110
Hello brother!
Can't you wait till my marriage?

1372
02:12:31,281 --> 02:12:33,272
It seems you fell in love
and marrying immediately.

1373
02:12:33,450 --> 02:12:36,044
Not like that you're a doctor and
we've to find a doctor for you,

1374
02:12:36,219 --> 02:12:38,278
it'll take time, that's why I...

1375
02:12:44,294 --> 02:12:47,457
Why have you lost weight, Anji?
- I'm on diet, madam.

1376
02:12:47,731 --> 02:12:50,598
Childhood memories are back
on seeing this home.

1377
02:12:50,734 --> 02:12:53,498
What would you remember if you
see that's hidden in tree?

1378
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:55,931
Somebody stamped my feet.
- Come silently.

1379
02:12:58,408 --> 02:12:59,432
Why did you stop? Come in.

1380
02:12:59,709 --> 02:13:01,506
I'll not come.
- What happened?

1381
02:13:01,678 --> 02:13:03,839
Will I enter without
getting proper welcome?

1382
02:13:04,014 --> 02:13:06,107
Why would she?
- Sister-in-law!

1383
02:13:06,282 --> 02:13:07,715
I'll give you a proper welcome.

1384
02:13:11,421 --> 02:13:13,651
It seems you rule this
place now, sister-in-law.

1385
02:13:13,823 --> 02:13:15,723
It seems your word is rule to my brother.

1386
02:13:15,992 --> 02:13:17,721
It seems everyone else is after you.

1387
02:13:18,361 --> 02:13:21,660
Not after me, anyone is after you only.

1388
02:13:24,601 --> 02:13:25,590
Brother!
- Yes.

1389
02:13:26,403 --> 02:13:29,201
Father is coming back to our home.
I'm very happy.

1390
02:13:29,372 --> 02:13:33,775
You mean?
- I mean as my forthcoming nephew.

1391
02:13:34,377 --> 02:13:38,040
Don't just say, look after him
as you're a doctor.

1392
02:13:38,214 --> 02:13:41,206
Okay, I'll take care.

1393
02:13:44,054 --> 02:13:48,548
Great sister-in-law! Excellent!
Your brother's selection.

1394
02:13:53,863 --> 02:13:56,764
Why did you keep the sword here?
- Why there's a sword here?

1395
02:13:57,033 --> 02:13:59,866
Your sister is pregnant, right?

1396
02:14:00,036 --> 02:14:02,061
To keep me away she's keeping it here.

1397
02:14:02,238 --> 02:14:02,897
So what?

1398
02:14:03,073 --> 02:14:06,804
It's a vow, if we keep it between
wife and husband while sleeping,

1399
02:14:06,976 --> 02:14:11,242
we'll have a sharp child.
- But still keep it away!

1400
02:14:11,414 --> 02:14:12,073
Okay.

1401
02:14:15,185 --> 02:14:17,244
Are you happy now?
I've thrown it.

1402
02:14:18,922 --> 02:14:19,581
You come here.

1403
02:14:19,823 --> 02:14:22,485
How did it come here?
- I'll punch you.

1404
02:14:22,826 --> 02:14:23,918
You hid all the weapons,

1405
02:14:24,127 --> 02:14:27,460
if there's an attack,
we must have at least one.

1406
02:14:27,864 --> 02:14:29,126
Isn't this knife?

1407
02:14:32,869 --> 02:14:34,234
We must get the tender again.

1408
02:14:34,437 --> 02:14:37,468
Brother-in-law, Veera is going to
the temple along with his sister.

1409
02:14:37,541 --> 02:14:39,272
It seems he'll not do anything
in his sister's presence.

1410
02:14:39,342 --> 02:14:41,003
This is the right time to
finish him, brother-in-law.

1411
02:14:46,683 --> 02:14:47,683
Get down dear!

1412
02:14:58,161 --> 02:14:59,492
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1413
02:15:00,930 --> 02:15:02,022
Greetings sir.

1414
02:15:02,298 --> 02:15:03,731
Are you fine, Sathya madam?
- I'm fine sir.

1415
02:15:03,867 --> 02:15:06,665
Priest, offer special prayers
by offering this sari,

1416
02:15:06,803 --> 02:15:09,033
present it to her by sister.
- Okay sir.

1417
02:15:11,241 --> 02:15:13,266
How much time do you take
to offer prayers, sir?

1418
02:15:13,443 --> 02:15:17,436
Four minutes.
- What? Did you see wrong faces?

1419
02:15:17,614 --> 02:15:21,607
Look there!
- I too know. Take care of them.

1420
02:16:28,218 --> 02:16:30,049
Left anyone?
- Would I?

1421
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,551
Please take the offering, sir.

1422
02:16:34,257 --> 02:16:37,021
Will you settle in city after marriage
or come here to run hospital?

1423
02:16:37,193 --> 02:16:38,883
And hurt us with injections.
- Look at him, brother!

1424
02:16:38,961 --> 02:16:41,193
One more word on Sathya,
I'll cut your throat.

1425
02:16:41,397 --> 02:16:43,627
Shut up, give me.
- It's not for you, it's for Veera.

1426
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:45,094
Not for me?

1427
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:46,626
All of you take it.

1428
02:16:49,973 --> 02:16:52,908
Did you prepare it?
My sister prepared it.

1429
02:16:53,076 --> 02:16:54,134
Bring the entire bowl.

1430
02:16:55,245 --> 02:16:56,303
Take it.
- Give.

1431
02:16:58,248 --> 02:16:59,078
Hold this.

1432
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:08,289
Bloody! Why did you inform about
our temple visit to Venkatrayudu?

1433
02:17:08,458 --> 02:17:10,085
Tell me... tell me.

1434
02:17:10,593 --> 02:17:12,458
How dare you stay with us and betray us?

1435
02:17:12,629 --> 02:17:13,618
Tell me, bloody!

1436
02:17:13,763 --> 02:17:14,787
Brother!
- Tell me.

1437
02:17:16,532 --> 02:17:17,089
Come.

1438
02:17:17,634 --> 02:17:18,760
Brother!

1439
02:17:20,136 --> 02:17:22,127
What's it dear?
- Come down quickly.

1440
02:17:27,176 --> 02:17:29,770
What's it? What happened?
- Do you know what did he do?

1441
02:17:30,246 --> 02:17:32,441
I saw in this home
what I never wanted to see.

1442
02:17:32,949 --> 02:17:36,510
He's beating him to bleed, brother.
He too is becoming like father.

1443
02:17:36,686 --> 02:17:40,588
Look at brother, how cool he is!
You are not, I can't stay here anymore.

1444
02:17:40,790 --> 02:17:43,588
I'll go immediately.
- He'll not beat anyone hereafter.

1445
02:17:43,793 --> 02:17:46,489
I'm telling you.
- Then, tell him to promise on me.

1446
02:17:46,629 --> 02:17:47,721
I promised you in our childhood.

1447
02:17:47,864 --> 02:17:49,957
You promised but he didn't.

1448
02:17:50,099 --> 02:17:52,260
You stand guaranty that
he'll not beat anyone.

1449
02:17:52,502 --> 02:17:54,868
Tell him to swear it on you,
only then I'll stay here.

1450
02:17:57,507 --> 02:17:59,202
Why are you thinking?
Promise on him.

1451
02:17:59,876 --> 02:18:01,707
Promise.

1452
02:18:13,456 --> 02:18:16,118
You don't worry, he has promised on me.

1453
02:18:16,626 --> 02:18:18,719
I'll ensure he'll stay out of troubles.

1454
02:18:19,796 --> 02:18:22,424
Give me a smile now.

1455
02:18:26,836 --> 02:18:28,929
Why did you make him promise on you?

1456
02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:30,997
I don't mind anything happening to me,

1457
02:18:31,441 --> 02:18:34,103
but if anything happens to you,
I can't bear it.

1458
02:18:34,344 --> 02:18:35,834
How lucky I am!

1459
02:18:40,983 --> 02:18:46,080
I expected he's dead from you but
have you come to tell you got beaten up?

1460
02:18:49,992 --> 02:18:51,220
Husband!

1461
02:18:52,228 --> 02:18:56,961
It's just water if you fill in pot,
it's holy water if it comes from conch.

1462
02:18:57,967 --> 02:19:00,231
You're a man if you kill Veera,

1463
02:19:00,436 --> 02:19:05,032
if you get him killed by others,
I'll not say,

1464
02:19:05,208 --> 02:19:08,871
I can't hear anyone else say that.
That's why!

1465
02:19:15,718 --> 02:19:20,280
Husband! Don't think I'm dying
as chaste married woman.

1466
02:19:22,258 --> 02:19:24,249
I'm dying with revenge.

1467
02:19:25,461 --> 02:19:31,263
Kill Veera and make my soul rest in peace.

1468
02:19:31,901 --> 02:19:35,564
If I die you'll kill him at least
for revenge.

1469
02:19:47,216 --> 02:19:51,312
When I'm inviting people
for the marriage, they're inquiring,

1470
02:19:52,255 --> 02:19:54,746
how much property Veera's
brother is having?

1471
02:19:55,825 --> 02:19:57,622
What's your son-in-law's status?

1472
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:59,819
There's no property on my brother's name.

1473
02:20:00,163 --> 02:20:02,461
You mean, is everything on your name?

1474
02:20:02,632 --> 02:20:06,159
Not a cent of land too.
Not even the home we're living now.

1475
02:20:07,370 --> 02:20:10,498
What's this?
Who owns the entire property then?

1476
02:20:15,411 --> 02:20:19,404
We've written entire property
on my sister's name.

1477
02:20:28,191 --> 02:20:31,126
You said people would accuse you
of usurping minors' property,

1478
02:20:31,294 --> 02:20:32,625
now, there's no problem,

1479
02:20:32,829 --> 02:20:35,423
I wanted to give these documents
on an auspicious day,

1480
02:20:35,631 --> 02:20:39,067
I can't get a better day than this,
take it.

1481
02:20:40,069 --> 02:20:42,469
When people said you were a God,

1482
02:20:42,905 --> 02:20:46,932
I thought God dwells only in temples
and not amongst people,

1483
02:20:48,611 --> 02:20:55,540
I was mad, I thought God means
a form, failed to see it,

1484
02:20:57,119 --> 02:21:04,119
I'm sad for not giving birth to you,
the property belongs to you,

1485
02:21:05,828 --> 02:21:10,288
if you give everything to my daughter,
what about you then?

1486
02:21:10,466 --> 02:21:17,167
Mother-in-law, my husband and
his moustache is my property.

1487
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:19,433
That's like Veera!

1488
02:21:20,610 --> 02:21:23,170
We're lucky to send our daughter
as your daughter-in-law.

1489
02:21:23,346 --> 02:21:26,338
Please forgive me.

1490
02:21:29,051 --> 02:21:29,840
What's the trouble?

1491
02:21:29,919 --> 02:21:33,314
What? How you were and
what you've become?

1492
02:21:33,489 --> 02:21:37,152
You're like tiger without moustache
and lion without mane.

1493
02:21:37,326 --> 02:21:40,693
Why are you chickening out?
Let's tell everything to Sathya.

1494
02:21:42,064 --> 02:21:44,862
I must tell you a truth.
- Hide him away. Take him away.

1495
02:21:45,701 --> 02:21:49,535
Stay in this till marriage is over.
- What are you searching, dear?

1496
02:21:49,705 --> 02:21:51,195
I can't find Pattas.

1497
02:21:51,374 --> 02:21:53,365
I've sent him on some errand.
You tell me, come.

1498
02:21:53,543 --> 02:21:56,706
Is it enough to see me
instead of entire village?

1499
02:21:57,046 --> 02:22:00,538
I'll bat first.
- Then, I'll bowl.

1500
02:22:00,883 --> 02:22:04,216
There's just one wicket here.
- Let's use this sack as wicket.

1501
02:22:04,487 --> 02:22:05,317
Help me.

1502
02:22:07,723 --> 02:22:08,883
Don't have a rubber ball?

1503
02:22:09,058 --> 02:22:11,356
I've got only cork ball,
let's play with it today.

1504
02:22:14,964 --> 02:22:16,522
The bag slid, see.

1505
02:22:53,903 --> 02:22:56,736
See the fire in the stove.
- Madam, please come here.

1506
02:22:56,906 --> 02:22:59,101
I'm coming.

1507
02:23:24,166 --> 02:23:26,964
Why are you leaving immediately?
Can't you stay for few more days?

1508
02:23:27,169 --> 02:23:29,797
I too don't want to go,
final semester exams.

1509
02:23:29,972 --> 02:23:32,964
If not I wouldn't have spared so
easily sister-in-law on her first night.

1510
02:23:33,109 --> 02:23:34,371
What great first night?

1511
02:23:34,710 --> 02:23:37,941
You carry for few minutes only
but make us carry for 9 months.

1512
02:23:38,114 --> 02:23:39,604
Don't you've shame?
- Do you've it?

1513
02:23:39,782 --> 02:23:40,942
I'll punch you.

1514
02:23:41,117 --> 02:23:42,778
Why can't you stay for another week, dear?

1515
02:23:43,386 --> 02:23:46,549
Anyway she'll come back here after exams.

1516
02:23:46,956 --> 02:23:48,821
You say I'll come, aren't you coming?

1517
02:23:49,925 --> 02:23:52,553
I can't stay away anymore from my son.

1518
02:23:53,295 --> 02:23:56,162
My life and death is now with my son.

1519
02:23:56,465 --> 02:23:59,400
From now I'll call you
as mother not as step mom.

1520
02:24:06,342 --> 02:24:07,331
Gone?

1521
02:24:08,010 --> 02:24:10,672
You must welcome with camphor
only when sister-in-law enters.

1522
02:24:10,846 --> 02:24:14,304
If you do that while going,
they'll take the luck with them.

1523
02:24:14,517 --> 02:24:19,318
I came to give it for my husband,
I always send him by applying a dot.

1524
02:24:22,658 --> 02:24:26,651
Brother, keep an eye on younger brother.
I'm little scared about him.

1525
02:24:26,862 --> 02:24:28,329
Don't worry, I'll take care.

1526
02:24:49,118 --> 02:24:51,109
Be careful dear, write your exams well.

1527
02:24:52,888 --> 02:24:53,752
Brother!

1528
02:25:14,143 --> 02:25:15,974
Come out!

1529
02:25:19,448 --> 02:25:20,244
Be careful, dear!

1530
02:25:22,918 --> 02:25:24,078
Leave him!

1531
02:25:27,423 --> 02:25:27,912
Come here!

1532
02:25:28,257 --> 02:25:28,780
Come dear.

1533
02:25:35,664 --> 02:25:36,289
You go away.

1534
02:25:43,072 --> 02:25:44,061
Mother-in-law!

1535
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:45,998
Go away!

1536
02:25:47,576 --> 02:25:48,440
Come one I say!

1537
02:26:25,447 --> 02:26:31,386
Grandma... grandma... Brother...

1538
02:26:46,168 --> 02:26:51,105
What happened?
- Chitti... mother...

1539
02:26:51,273 --> 02:26:52,103
Mother...

1540
02:27:02,484 --> 02:27:05,317
She's pregnant too!

1541
02:27:09,658 --> 02:27:11,023
Mother!

1542
02:29:28,897 --> 02:29:31,161
Chitti, let's go to the hospital.

1543
02:29:33,335 --> 02:29:35,826
Does Seekakulam Seetha still loves you?

1544
02:29:36,271 --> 02:29:42,267
Will you marry her?
Shall we love more?

1545
02:29:45,347 --> 02:29:46,837
I don't mind anything happening to me,

1546
02:29:47,516 --> 02:29:49,416
but I can't bear anything happening to you.

1547
02:29:49,551 --> 02:29:51,815
You'll be fine, nothing will happen to you.

1548
02:29:52,154 --> 02:29:55,646
I used to apply dot to you whenever
you go out, I'm dying now.

1549
02:29:55,824 --> 02:29:57,815
I want to apply dot to you
for that last time.

1550
02:30:21,717 --> 02:30:25,619
Sister Sathya saw her family die gorily,

1551
02:30:25,788 --> 02:30:29,087
Sathya who hates violence
went away from Veera,

1552
02:30:29,324 --> 02:30:30,916
for the promise given to father,

1553
02:30:31,126 --> 02:30:35,290
Sathya didn't realise Veera had
to break the promise given to her.

1554
02:30:37,699 --> 02:30:40,463
Lakhs of people used to wait for Veera,

1555
02:30:41,236 --> 02:30:47,732
after seven years in jail, not even
his sister is willing to see him.

1556
02:30:52,414 --> 02:30:54,974
He's not alone, I'm there for him.

1557
02:30:55,651 --> 02:30:59,417
I'll wait all my life for such a good man.

1558
02:31:06,595 --> 02:31:12,591
Come Veera...

1559
02:31:29,118 --> 02:31:31,746
Break into a jig with fast beat...

1560
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:34,912
If you say once more, I can't take it...

1561
02:31:40,162 --> 02:31:42,926
The girl is ravishing...
Body is great...

1562
02:31:43,165 --> 02:31:45,929
The offer is enticing,
I can't wait any more...

1563
02:31:46,168 --> 02:31:51,504
Veera, on seeing you my drapes
are slipping away...

1564
02:31:51,673 --> 02:31:57,111
Take on me, Mass king...
Your tweakers are hurting me...

1565
02:31:57,279 --> 02:32:02,774
I want you to love me...
I'm yearning for it...

1566
02:32:14,129 --> 02:32:16,654
Veera, bombard me...

1567
02:32:56,038 --> 02:32:58,700
Your charm has taken over me
with evil eye cast on me...

1568
02:32:58,874 --> 02:33:01,536
I've gone crazy, what am I to do?

1569
02:33:01,710 --> 02:33:07,205
Yes, take chances and have a go...

1570
02:33:07,382 --> 02:33:13,048
Watching your manliness...
Come to me...

1571
02:33:15,958 --> 02:33:21,396
In your speed...
there's something special in it...

1572
02:33:21,563 --> 02:33:27,559
In your sharp eyes...
I'll lose myself...

1573
02:34:20,255 --> 02:34:25,955
You lit fire in me with your teeth marks
It's a routine whenever you see me...

1574
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:37,132
You came in with milk and fruits
and made me crazy...

1575
02:34:39,941 --> 02:34:45,607
How can I stop myself from touching you?

1576
02:34:45,781 --> 02:34:48,443
With your desires...
you've raked passions in me...

1577
02:34:48,617 --> 02:34:51,711
Pricking me with your eyes...
you've pinned me down...

1578
02:35:14,009 --> 02:35:16,842
Getting hurt in the attack
on ACP Shyamsundar,

1579
02:35:17,012 --> 02:35:21,005
Veera, who was security officer to ACP
and was on the verge of death,

1580
02:35:21,183 --> 02:35:25,643
Shyam's wife Dr. Sathya saved him
from death after a 4 hour operation.

1581
02:35:27,656 --> 02:35:30,147
Have you saved your brother's life?

1582
02:35:30,325 --> 02:35:33,522
He survived without knowing
that I'm still alive.

1583
02:35:44,206 --> 02:35:45,696
Where is he?
- Who do you want to see?

1584
02:35:46,041 --> 02:35:47,633
Where is Veera?
- I don't know.

1585
02:35:47,776 --> 02:35:48,868
Where is Veera?

1586
02:36:00,722 --> 02:36:03,919
Have you come?
- Have you escaped?

1587
02:36:04,192 --> 02:36:09,027
I'm not coward to escape.
I'm brave.

1588
02:36:09,197 --> 02:36:10,562
Where are you?

1589
02:36:10,732 --> 02:36:16,136
Had I turned back to check on that day,
you wouldn't be alive today,

1590
02:36:16,638 --> 02:36:19,971
I'm in the place
where you killed my people.

1591
02:36:20,242 --> 02:36:23,405
Come... come here!
- Wait there, I'm coming!

1592
02:37:15,931 --> 02:37:19,867
It was the weapon used to kill your family.

1593
02:37:21,069 --> 02:37:25,904
The weapon that kissed your unborn child.

1594
02:37:26,475 --> 02:37:31,606
The weapon that's waiting
for seven years to kill you.

1595
02:37:33,782 --> 02:37:36,615
Still didn't get sense
after nearly dying once.

1596
02:37:37,285 --> 02:37:40,880
You trust the weapon and I trust this soil.

1597
02:37:41,456 --> 02:37:44,789
This is the land where my father
treaded with justice.

1598
02:37:45,827 --> 02:37:48,227
If I let evil men like you to live,

1599
02:37:48,463 --> 02:37:51,591
people would stop installing God's idols.

1600
02:37:52,801 --> 02:37:57,500
You got saved your life in hospital,
but invited death to you.

1601
02:37:57,672 --> 02:38:01,836
I didn't invite you to die
but to kill. Come!

1602
02:39:13,315 --> 02:39:15,749
You wanted to hack me, right?
Come on do it.

1603
02:39:24,092 --> 02:39:26,083
Come... come...

1604
02:40:09,170 --> 02:40:12,230
Brother!
- Uncle!

1605
02:40:15,543 --> 02:40:19,274
Uncle!

1606
02:40:30,959 --> 02:40:34,122
Uncle!
- Hubby!

1607
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:40,163
Don't leave him, kill him!

1608
02:40:41,002 --> 02:40:45,496
Father was right, if you spare evil,
they'll not the good to live.

1609
02:40:46,107 --> 02:40:48,007
Kill him, brother!

1610
02:41:14,602 --> 02:41:18,299
Where are you going away, Veera?

1611
02:41:18,707 --> 02:41:20,197
I'm waiting for you.

1612
02:41:20,707 --> 02:41:27,707
TheDarkMaster[TDM] -=MTR=...
