00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,982
Hello!

2
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:55,733
Hello, who is there?

3
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:56,733
Hello!

4
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,441
Hello, who are you?

5
00:06:59,024 --> 00:06:59,857
Hello!

6
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,399
Hello, who are you?

7
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:02,316
Hello!

8
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:03,107
Hello!

9
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:04,691
Can't you hear me scream?

10
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:44,232
Hey, you've shoot tomorrow.
Drink little.

11
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:51,107
Dude.

12
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:51,815
Okay...okay.

13
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:55,898
Excuse me...

14
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:57,733
One more large, please.

15
00:07:58,898 --> 00:07:59,524
Hi!

16
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:00,524
Hi.

17
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,399
Looks like you're having fun.

18
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,065
Yeah.

19
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:05,898
All alone?

20
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:07,107
Of course.

21
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:10,107
Indeed, I like that.

22
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:10,524
Oh.

23
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,982
Just me...and me...

24
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:14,274
Same here.

25
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,898
I like my "me time" too.

26
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:20,441
It doesn't seem like that.

27
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,857
Oh, those guys?

28
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:24,898
They're my friends.

29
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:26,441
It's my friend's treat, today.

30
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:29,857
He has signed his second film.

31
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,441
He is a director.

32
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:32,857
Nice.

33
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:38,190
Have we ever met before?

34
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:42,898
Damn! What a dumb pick up line.

35
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:46,898
Here is your drink, sir.

36
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,982
Thank you.

37
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:54,733
Can I join you
in your "me time"?

38
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,898
Hey, go easy, okay.

39
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:03,524
You're very high, already.

40
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:04,733
High?

41
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:06,441
I know...I know...

42
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:09,316
You didn't answer my question.

43
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:14,024
Shall I consider that as, "no"?

44
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:15,482
I'll take it as "no".

45
00:09:15,482 --> 00:09:21,190
You relish your "me time"
along with that 'me'.

46
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,733
Bye.

47
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,898
"Bikki Likki Bikki Likki...Ki..Ki.."

48
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,607
"A lust of fire in the heart
as time moves on"

49
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:52,107
"Bikki Likki Bikki Likki...Ki..Ki.."

50
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:55,815
"A lust of fire in the heart
as time moves on"

51
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:06,399
"Bikki Likki Bikki Likki...Ki..Ki.."

52
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,857
"A lust of fire in the heart
as time moves on"

53
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:11,274
"Get high"

54
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:14,065
"Don't search for me within you
 just to lose yourself"

55
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:14,898
"Get high"

56
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,649
"Don't take a dip in the sky
in search of me"

57
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:18,733
"Hangout"

58
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:21,524
"Don't tell me your desires in loops"

59
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:29,190
"You are on top of the sky,
what more are you searching beyond that?"

60
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,441
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

61
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:36,107
"You are on top of the sky,
 what more are you searching beyond that?"

62
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:39,316
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

63
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:15,649
"Eyes are longing and,
Why dont you rock my world"

64
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,898
"Quench my thirst"

65
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,857
"You can tell your needs"

66
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:23,274
"You got all night"

67
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:26,065
"To satisfy the desires"

68
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:29,524
"This is Life"

69
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,691
"This is the answer"

70
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,399
"Get high..."

71
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,316
"Be Me..."

72
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:39,482
"Take my Hands..."

73
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:42,441
"Reach for the Sky"

74
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:46,065
"You are on top of the sky,
what more are you searching beyond that?"

75
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:48,274
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

76
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,065
"Why did you seek me?"

77
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:53,691
"You are on top of the sky,
what more are you searching beyond that?"

78
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:55,898
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

79
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,024
"You are on top of the sky,
what more are you searching beyond that?"

80
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,232
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

81
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:05,024
"Why did you seek me?"

82
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,649
"You are on top of the sky,
what more are you searching beyond that?"

83
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:10,857
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

84
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:50,399
Actually, I'm waiting for my Boy Friend.

85
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:52,898
It's a lie.

86
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,898
Hey, it's true.

87
00:12:55,898 --> 00:12:57,482
Then, give me his contact number.

88
00:12:58,357 --> 00:12:59,024
Why?

89
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,232
I'll call and tell him,

90
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:04,815
"Hey Loser,  You have made
 such a beautiful girl wait so long..."

91
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:06,691
"...now go back home
and that's the Penalty".

92
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:10,524
Malar...

93
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:12,733
Malarvizhi...

94
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:16,733
Malarvizhi!

95
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,982
What an adorable Tamil name!

96
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:21,524
Who names like these,
now-a-days?

97
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:22,982
Mathi...

98
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:23,982
Mathi...

99
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:25,024
Mathiazhagan.

100
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:27,065
Mathiazhagan.

101
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:30,232
You lied about your Boy Friend right?

102
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:33,399
I know...

103
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,649
Come, let's meet my friends.

104
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,524
Wait,

105
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,441
No need.

106
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:43,524
Just you and me!

107
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:44,482
Okay!

108
00:13:46,774 --> 00:13:47,982
Why is he calling?

109
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:54,232
Why is he not answering?!

110
00:13:57,065 --> 00:13:57,898
Poor guy.

111
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:00,107
Film maker.

112
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:00,898
I'm sorry.

113
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:01,607
Movie..,

114
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:02,898
Director.

115
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:04,524
Liar.

116
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:07,232
You said that your friend
is the director.

117
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:09,316
I swear, I'm a Director too.

118
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:11,607
I worked as an Assistant director
for three films.

119
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:13,607
Now, I'm working on my own script.

120
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:15,441
I'll commence soon.

121
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:16,316
Wow!

122
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,649
Congrats!
I'm a writer too.

123
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,982
Don't tell just for sake.

124
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:21,316
I don't see your sling bag?

125
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:24,649
Do you always keep
your hand this way?

126
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,649
Didn't I believe?

127
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,524
Well, now that I know
you are a writer as well..

128
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,482
And we both belong to
the same fraternity.

129
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,982
In fact,

130
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:37,524
I shot my first script
for ten days and got stalled.

131
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:39,399
That's something disparate.

132
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,274
Leave it.

133
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:41,898
Hey, relax.

134
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:44,982
I'm sorry.
-sorry.

135
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:47,107
What are you writing, currently?

136
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,898
I have published a book.

137
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:52,482
Title?

138
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:56,107
It's not that familiar.

139
00:14:56,524 --> 00:14:58,399
Wonder, whether you'll know if say.

140
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,607
"Mirage"....
("Katchi pizhai")

141
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,649
I'm not aware.

142
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:06,524
I'm sorry.
I'm not an avid reader.

143
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:07,316
So...

144
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:10,482
What are you writing currently?

145
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,316
I'm trying...

146
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:14,898
I don't know.

147
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:15,898
Yet to get the plot.

148
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,691
You know, that spark...

149
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,399
What to write...

150
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:23,024
Writer's block...

151
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,399
I know.

152
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:29,107
Millions of thoughts arise in our mind...

153
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:31,524
...but, we won't get anything
upon writing.

154
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:32,649
You know what?

155
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,316
It's destined that we both
ought to meet today.

156
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:37,482
Is it?

157
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:38,524
Yes.

158
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:40,815
You know.

159
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,024
Just you and me...

160
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:46,107
...after meeting.

161
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:48,274
May be just...

162
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:53,524
Malar!

163
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:56,774
Hey, Malar!

164
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,316
Mathi, why did you mess it up?

165
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:47,123
Hey, who is this?

166
00:21:48,415 --> 00:21:50,747
Aunty, I've come to deliver  courier
to Malarvizhi aunty.

167
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:51,956
Do I look like an aunty to you?

168
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:55,248
Sorry, madam.
For Malarvizhi aunty...

169
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:56,831
She is a young girl too, like me.

170
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:58,373
If the make up is wiped off,
She'll resemble a mango vendor.

171
00:21:58,415 --> 00:21:59,706
Okay, did you ring
the door bell?

172
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:00,831
I ringed twice, aunty.

173
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:02,664
Sorry..madam

174
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:04,747
What is it aunty?

175
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,747
Okay, give it to me.
I'll hand over to her.

176
00:22:07,998 --> 00:22:10,290
If you don't mind,
shall I check with her?

177
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,747
Okay, make it quick.

178
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,873
It's time for my yoga session.

179
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,831
Just to nap on the mat,
so much of drama.

180
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:22,498
It's switched off.

181
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:23,373
Is it switched off?

182
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:24,582
Shall I try again?

183
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:29,081
Oh no, it's the boss again!

184
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,664
Madam, a call from office.
Shall I attend?

185
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:33,498
Hello, sir.

186
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:35,747
Cooling sir, Cooling sir, Cooling.
-cooling?

187
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:37,039
Sir, if you don't mind,

188
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,373
Can you come and collect
from our courier office?

189
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:41,081
Sir, don't scold me.

190
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,165
I'll come, sir.

191
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:43,373
I'll come in five minutes.

192
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:44,498
Okay, sir.

193
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:47,165
She pulls off theatrics of 6 actors,
in 3 minutes

194
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:48,747
Madam, when will she be back?

195
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:50,373
Is there anyone known to her?

196
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:51,831
How would I know,
if you ask me?

197
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:54,373
As far as I know,
she doesn't have anyone close.

198
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,331
She stays alone.

199
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,914
May be, her folks are
in her native.

200
00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:59,456
She won't communicate with us freely.
-Oh, no! Madam please.

201
00:22:59,456 --> 00:22:59,956
So, about her...

202
00:22:59,956 --> 00:23:01,123
I must go.
Come and sign here, please.

203
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:02,582
You asked for her details.
Ignore it, if you don't need.

204
00:23:02,623 --> 00:23:04,039
Bro, just a minute.
-who is he?

205
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:07,039
Malar, I have spoken
to the delivery boy.

206
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,498
Will you speak to him once?

207
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:09,248
Give me.
-okay.

208
00:23:09,582 --> 00:23:10,248
Give

209
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:12,747
Yeah, okay.
I'll talk to you later.

210
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:14,873
Sir, she is in a meeting.

211
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:16,165
Asked me to get
the courier from you.

212
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:16,956
I'll take it.

213
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:18,831
It was switched off,
when I called.

214
00:23:19,623 --> 00:23:21,248
It's the office landline number.

215
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,165
Who are you?

216
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:25,664
He is from our floor.
K7, right?

217
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,540
Yes, Aunty.
I'm Kesavan.

218
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:28,582
Told you!

219
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:31,373
How can I trust you?

220
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:32,747
Better, give to aunty.

221
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:34,873
Okay, give to me.
I'll take care.

222
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:36,456
Aunty is getting late
for yoga session, isn't it?

223
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,582
Oh, no! I forgot it.

224
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,039
It's time for yoga session.
Give to him.

225
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:39,873
I'm leaving.

226
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:40,498
Okay.

227
00:23:40,498 --> 00:23:42,914
Excuse me.
-yes.

228
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:44,373
Are you going to yoga session?
-yes.

229
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,039
If you take the steps.
That might be a warm up.

230
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:46,956
Why do you prefer the lift?

231
00:23:46,998 --> 00:23:48,373
I'll do yoga inside the lift.

232
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:49,664
Yoga inside the lift?

233
00:23:49,747 --> 00:23:51,165
Will she go head over heels?

234
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:52,747
Sir, why bother how she goes?
The parcel?

235
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:54,873
Yes, why  bother about her
Sign here.

236
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:57,664
What's your name?
-Ram.

237
00:23:57,873 --> 00:23:59,290
You mean, "Katradhu Tamil",
director Ram?

238
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:00,582
Hey, why you nod as yes?

239
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:02,165
Aunty told that you're Kesavan.

240
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:05,165
That is....K7

241
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:06,498
The door number is K7.
-what?

242
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:08,873
Moron, She mentioned the door number is it?

243
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:11,747
Okay, show me the licence.

244
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:16,956
I have the licence, brother.

245
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:17,956
That's what I asked for.

246
00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:20,039
Be quiet...

247
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,498
Sir, I'm coming.
I'm coming by the bike.

248
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:29,165
I didn't spit, sir.

249
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:31,331
The guy next to me
in bike is spitting.

250
00:24:31,456 --> 00:24:32,664
I'll come, sir.
I'll come.

251
00:24:33,747 --> 00:24:35,165
See how I cheated
my boss!

252
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,373
Okay, I'm leaving.

253
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:38,914
I just started the inquiry.
Stay here.

254
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,123
Thilak Chandra Mohan.

255
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:43,081
Bro, it's written as
Thilak Chandra Mohan.

256
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:44,956
Ram, is my nick name.

257
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:46,747
Everyone at home and friends
call me fondly.

258
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:49,165
You can't write the nick names
called at home and by neighborhood aunty.

259
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:49,747
Sorry.

260
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:51,165
Nick names are
meant for the dogs.

261
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:53,123
We use nick names for ourselves and
insult the dogs.

262
00:24:54,123 --> 00:24:54,498
Take it.

263
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:55,956
Give it to me.

264
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:56,747
Sorry, sir.

265
00:24:56,873 --> 00:24:57,747
Thank you.

266
00:24:58,623 --> 00:24:59,664
What a fellow!

267
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,123
Cat-thief.

268
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:07,747
Bro,
-what?

269
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,165
What's your contact number?

270
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:12,914
95987 59268

271
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:14,456
Junk number!

272
00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:18,165
Hello.

273
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:19,373
Hello, bro.

274
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:20,373
It's me calling.

275
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:21,373
I just checked.

276
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:23,582
Are you suspicious on me?

277
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:24,331
Definitely.

278
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:26,123
Check yourself on the mirror.

279
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:27,582
Okay, bye.

280
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:30,582
Why aunty has left the yoga mat
in the lift?

281
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:34,540
He too adds fuel
to the problems.

282
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:00,664
Oh...oh...

283
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,165
My place.

284
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,415
Dude, I'll move.

285
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,873
Dude, he is an excellent producer.

286
00:26:52,873 --> 00:26:54,248
He didn't even let me approach him.

287
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:55,456
You got a very good opportunity.

288
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:56,248
Don't miss it.

289
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,331
Mathi, the screenplay
is amazing.

290
00:26:58,664 --> 00:26:59,456
I don't deny that.

291
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:03,582
But, this budget is too high
for a debut film.

292
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,540
Earlier, the shoot was
done for ten days and got stalled.

293
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:08,956
Sir, that is...
-of course,

294
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:10,623
It's not your mistake.

295
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:11,873
I'm just telling you.

296
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:15,456
This field (Cinema) believes in superstitions.

297
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:17,540
Just tell me a simple line.

298
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:19,206
But, only two days.

299
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:20,831
If you don't tell me...

300
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:22,582
I'll give the project to him.

301
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:26,081
You're following up for an year now
and you're good at scripting.

302
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:27,165
That's the only reason
I'm offering this opportunity.

303
00:27:28,248 --> 00:27:30,039
If it's impressive,
we'll commence the project soon.

304
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,873
But, just two days.

305
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:34,623
Don't mistake me, Mathi.

306
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:37,873
Even this second chance
is only for your dad's sake.

307
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:41,206
He had worked as Co-director
for twenty years and...

308
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:42,998
Fine!

309
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:44,456
Come day after tomorrow.

310
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:45,540
Okay!

311
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,540
Let's do this.

312
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:02,582
Brother...

313
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,415
Hey, why did you
guys come here?

314
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:05,081
Come...come...

315
00:28:05,123 --> 00:28:06,456
What's this? It's similar to
an investigation room.

316
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:06,873
Come...

317
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:08,456
Clear out.

318
00:28:08,498 --> 00:28:10,081
What's all these?

319
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:11,081
Writing... it's writing.

320
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,664
He'll write the story like this.

321
00:28:13,873 --> 00:28:14,456
You mean, story?

322
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:15,664
Hey, check this out!
-go away.

323
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:18,956
He has broken doors.
-I'm papa speaking.

324
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:21,873
Who is that peeping
through the door?

325
00:28:21,998 --> 00:28:22,831
Our Jack!

326
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:23,415
Brother, it should be cool.
-say, cheese!

327
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:25,415
Brother, it should be cool.
-cheese!

328
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:26,831
Tell me that number.

329
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:27,623
Don't disgrace me.
-98

330
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:28,456
Hey,
-409

331
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,873
Oh...
-02729

332
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:31,373
Don't both of you've shoot?

333
00:28:31,498 --> 00:28:32,415
It's cancelled.

334
00:28:32,415 --> 00:28:34,081
They've come as
it's free booze.

335
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:35,540
You think of everyone like you.

336
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,206
Brother, instead of straining
just to write..

337
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:41,081
I'll give you four hard disks.

338
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:42,789
Four films.
Just write cheerfully.

339
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:43,456
Hey.

340
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:45,789
Dude, don't you have many story lines?

341
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:47,248
You don't you narrate a few.

342
00:28:47,248 --> 00:28:49,081
Don't you know the huge
demand for Adult comedy?

343
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:50,415
The budget is not set right, dude.

344
00:28:50,415 --> 00:28:51,747
You're not smart enough, dude.

345
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,248
Brother, it's just cinema.

346
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,956
If you say this is just cinema,

347
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:57,415
I'll take your life, just like that!

348
00:28:57,415 --> 00:28:58,373
Why?

349
00:28:58,373 --> 00:29:01,540
The way we perceive the movies
is different from his.

350
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
Be quiet.

351
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:04,165
Dude, is everything ready?

352
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,998
Everything is ready, buddy.

353
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,165
Good job, bro.

354
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:08,456
Come on, let's go.
-hundred points for you.

355
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:09,789
No, I'm not coming.

356
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,248
No.
-It's okay. Come.

357
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:11,956
I'm not coming.

358
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:12,956
Brother...

359
00:29:12,956 --> 00:29:14,456
He is going to turn a lunatic
like that Jack....

360
00:29:14,498 --> 00:29:15,540
...the one behind the door.

361
00:29:16,248 --> 00:29:17,165
Have you seen that film?

362
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:19,540
In the end, that writer kills his
wife and son.

363
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:20,956
Have you seen it?

364
00:29:20,956 --> 00:29:22,789
Stop showing off your
World Cinema intellect!

365
00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:24,664
Were you not the one who
was amazed watching "Anaconda".

366
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:27,165
If you've watched "The shining"
Wouldn't we've seen it?

367
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,998
Not only in films, even in
the real life there are psycho writers.

368
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,081
Brother, isn't it too much for our place?

369
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:37,331
Even in our place, there are people
who does anything for the sake of art.

370
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,789
There are method actors who
work hard to justify their roles.

371
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:42,789
All this is possible only,
when there is passion on cinema.

372
00:29:44,456 --> 00:29:45,456
Go and continue
you've come for.

373
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:47,331
You stay as the lunatic Jack.

374
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,664
Let me be the Titanic Jack.

375
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,664
Come.
-"every night in my dreams..."

376
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,623
I'm not coming.
Understand me.

377
00:29:54,248 --> 00:29:55,373
I'm not coming.

378
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:57,248
C'mon dude! You might find
your story even there.

379
00:29:59,206 --> 00:30:01,582
Hey, why are you coming irky?

380
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:05,831
I have signed the second film
and throwing a party happily.

381
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:06,789
But, you continue to rant.

382
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:07,664
I know.

383
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:10,456
First film.

384
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:12,873
Can't do high budget.

385
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:16,789
Producer has asked to narrate
another story line.

386
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:20,039
I'm not getting any spark.

387
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:21,998
It's the season of thriller genre.

388
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:23,248
and is looking for the same!

389
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:25,248
Oh, won't he settle for anything else?!

390
00:30:25,664 --> 00:30:27,081
Why don't we rip-off  half of
that Korean movie,

391
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:29,456
We watched another movie
the other day, right?

392
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:31,747
And the Chinese movie,
for the other half.

393
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:32,331
Oh, my ghosh!

394
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,664
Why don't we throw you out?

395
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:35,165
Vatsa.

396
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:37,623
Buddy, somehow we'll make it.

397
00:30:37,664 --> 00:30:38,664
Cool, dude.

398
00:30:39,248 --> 00:30:40,956
Do you remember
the number I said?

399
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,831
984...

400
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:45,248
Do you remember?

401
00:30:45,373 --> 00:30:50,873
I don't.
-98-409-027-29

402
00:30:50,914 --> 00:30:51,664
Thank you very much, ji.

403
00:30:51,664 --> 00:30:52,373
Wow!

404
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:56,415
Hello brother, bring the liquor
to the parking lot of the pub.

405
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:57,165
Liquor?!

406
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:59,456
The important stuff
which I said, brother.

407
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:00,540
Okay, I'll come.

408
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,248
The fatso seems loaded...

409
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,623
I'll come in five minutes.

410
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:04,081
Okay, done.

411
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:05,248
He is a habitual drinker
for generations.

412
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,873
What's that?

413
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,623
Brother, it's our special stuff.

414
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:09,582
We'll rock.

415
00:31:09,747 --> 00:31:11,831
Hey, we are going
to booze, right?

416
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:12,789
Then why all these?

417
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,456
A cost of a bottle here
equals a peg there.

418
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:16,664
You're right.
-Hey stingy,

419
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:17,789
It's me who's giving the treat right!

420
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:19,664
Do whatever you want.

421
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:20,831
Let's go tonight..

422
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:22,373
Celebrate the whole night..

423
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:24,248
Tomorrow, we'll fish for
plenty of story lines!

424
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:25,664
Wonder, whatever we are going to fish!

425
00:31:27,206 --> 00:31:29,456
Hey, isn't it too much?

426
00:31:29,706 --> 00:31:34,039
Bro, not just one, you'll find
millions of stories if you take this.

427
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,248
Just get high.

428
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:35,873
Vatsa.

429
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:50,248
Don't spoil everyone.
-Oh, my god!

430
00:31:50,914 --> 00:31:53,831
Hey Vatsa, this sin won't
let you off easily.

431
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:56,540
Thank you.
-worst behaviour.

432
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,081
Awesome...

433
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:21,664
Vatsa, each and every story
is like a new birth.

434
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,873
Here he goes!

435
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:27,540
We should be born, live
and die along with it.

436
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:29,873
Take it.

437
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:32,206
That's Ok! I got more!

438
00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:34,248
You have fun!
-Crazy bugger!

439
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:35,331
Thank you, boss.

440
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:44,373
Bro... please.

441
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:47,081
I brought them saying as treat.

442
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:49,747
They're staring me.

443
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,789
I told you, isn't it?

444
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:01,290
Not to believe him.

445
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,331
Come, let's go.

446
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:04,540
How much, bro?

447
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,747
Somehow, I managed to
come along.

448
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,206
Please, go.

449
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,998
Come this side.

450
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:23,582
Go.

451
00:33:23,582 --> 00:33:25,623
You're inebriated.

452
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:26,456
Go...

453
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:28,831
He is going to get
alcohol for free.

454
00:33:30,998 --> 00:33:33,664
Hey, I feel ashame.

455
00:33:33,664 --> 00:33:34,664
How long?

456
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,039
You would've asked her.

457
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,290
We don't have time.

458
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,290
We would've gone to TASMAC.

459
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,415
Where is she?
Has she left?

460
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,914
Hey! Look here!

461
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:10,664
Dude, superb!

462
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:23,498
Will you ask or shall I?

463
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:25,831
I'll ask dude.

464
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,956
Dude, go...

465
00:34:55,415 --> 00:34:56,290
Dude!

466
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,664
Finally, you're rocking.

467
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,373
Who are you?

468
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,290
Why did you bring me here?

469
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,623
You came on your own.

470
00:35:20,582 --> 00:35:22,831
If you wanted to die,
why din't you go elsewhere.

471
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,248
This is your house, right?

472
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:28,415
Your house...

473
00:35:29,873 --> 00:35:30,373
Okay.

474
00:35:30,623 --> 00:35:32,123
Why did you get me here?

475
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:38,706
I'll kill you, if you stare like that.

476
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:39,873
I'll kill you.

477
00:35:58,415 --> 00:35:58,998
Sorry.

478
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:01,914
I'm sorry.

479
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,706
I don't know,
what your problem is?

480
00:36:07,747 --> 00:36:09,123
But, for ten long years...

481
00:36:09,623 --> 00:36:12,039
Cinema, love, humiliation
and hard work...

482
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:14,290
Tomorrow is the day of
outcome for everything.

483
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:15,914
But, you ruined everything.

484
00:36:31,747 --> 00:36:32,664
Who are you?

485
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:36,415
I did not even know who you
were until last night.

486
00:36:43,998 --> 00:36:45,415
Money is not important to me.

487
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:47,914
The love on cinema.

488
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:51,206
In fact I haven't even been in love!

489
00:36:52,873 --> 00:36:56,456
Even last night, I came here
 because I was high.

490
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,290
But, I haven't done anything.

491
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:03,123
Yes, I haven't done anything.

492
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:05,498
It's you...you...you...
You are the reason for everything.

493
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:09,456
I won't lose my cinema
for anything.

494
00:37:09,914 --> 00:37:10,706
I'm going away from here.

495
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:11,998
It's up to you...

496
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:20,206
"Has the night left out of hand?"

497
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:51,206
"Has the night left out of hand?"

498
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:57,039
"The breeze at night
awaits to leave"

499
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:02,789
"The time the demon stays"

500
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:07,290
"Why this turbulence ?"
"The thought trembles on..."

501
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:12,415
"Will you escape
being caught in the stone box?"

502
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:18,623
"You've come close to death"

503
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:24,123
"You've come listening to a girl"
"No way to escape...!"

504
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:29,290
"The fire spread as a circle!"

505
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:44,456
"Has the night left out of hand?"

506
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,290
"The breeze at night
awaits to leave"

507
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:56,039
"The time the demon stays"

508
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,582
"Why this turbulence ?"
"The thought trembles on..."

509
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:19,831
I published a book.

510
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:20,706
Title?

511
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:21,998
"Mirage".
"Kaatchi pizhai" .

512
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:44,498
"The cries of death is heard"

513
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,039
"Struggling for life...!"

514
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:49,706
"Will hit the person"

515
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:52,831
"The fear bursts, over night"

516
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:55,373
"The cries of death is heard"

517
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:57,873
"Struggling for life...!"

518
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:00,498
"Will hit the person"

519
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,664
"The fear bursts, over night"

520
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:08,415
"And the whirl wind"

521
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:13,914
"The dream come true!"

522
00:41:13,956 --> 00:41:25,664
"When spotting the blood,
Haven't recovered yet from forgetfulness"

523
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:30,415
"Has the night left out of hand?"

524
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:36,248
"The breeze at night
awaits to leave"

525
00:41:36,248 --> 00:41:41,998
"The time the demon stays"

526
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:46,498
"Why this turbulence ?"
"The thought trembles on..."

527
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,744
Hey, I don't believe in ghosts.

528
00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:39,869
Do not scare me! Alright.

529
00:42:43,286 --> 00:42:45,494
Me...You...

530
00:42:46,703 --> 00:42:48,911
Let's just talk.

531
00:42:49,327 --> 00:42:49,744
Okay?

532
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:51,244
Okay?

533
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:32,327
I'm sorry.

534
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:35,494
Sorry, okay?

535
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:39,661
I need to go away from here.

536
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,536
I'm not in the right state
to worry about you.

537
00:43:46,786 --> 00:43:48,828
But, I'm sure someone will come and...

538
00:43:51,703 --> 00:43:52,411
Will come and...

539
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:11,411
You won't allow me
to go from here, right?

540
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:39,744
Failed love?

541
00:45:54,327 --> 00:45:55,953
Looks like, you're a bookworm.

542
00:46:01,202 --> 00:46:04,119
There is not just one love,
don't you know that?

543
00:46:07,536 --> 00:46:09,452
Isn't it love failure?

544
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,911
If death is the solution
for all the problems,

545
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:17,828
I should've been dead long ago.

546
00:46:20,036 --> 00:46:22,494
The first time during a shoot,
when the director cursed me...

547
00:46:22,828 --> 00:46:24,036
...a moron before
hundreds of people.

548
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:32,286
When my friend pitched
my script as his and succeeded.

549
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:34,494
That's okay.

550
00:46:39,286 --> 00:46:41,494
I received advance and
signed my first film...

551
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:43,327
...and got stalled
after ten days of the shoot.

552
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:46,119
Damn! Don't know
why I am ranting to you!

553
00:46:46,744 --> 00:46:48,119
She is dead and
taking out my life.

554
00:48:36,536 --> 00:48:37,119
Sorry.

555
00:48:39,744 --> 00:48:40,536
Sorry, alright?

556
00:49:11,661 --> 00:49:12,327
Greetings, sir.

557
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:13,703
Is this the time to come?

558
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:15,202
Got stuck with work at the first floor.

559
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,327
I'll quickly finish it in an hour.

560
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:18,327
You said that you'll finish
the work in the morning.

561
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:19,953
How late you're?
-I will finish it.

562
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:23,036
Be careful.

563
00:51:37,286 --> 00:51:38,411
Hey, Police guys! it's the police!

564
00:51:38,703 --> 00:51:41,327
Don't go to the 20th floor,
cops are around!

565
00:51:41,327 --> 00:51:42,244
Twenty floors!

566
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:44,119
How do you manage during power failure?

567
00:51:44,286 --> 00:51:45,828
We have back up, madam.

568
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,202
You guys got everything.

569
00:51:51,077 --> 00:51:51,494
It's over.

570
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:54,869
Everything is over.

571
00:51:58,286 --> 00:51:59,703
Ten years of my dreams
are shattered.

572
00:52:03,744 --> 00:52:05,869
Brother,
Come back after five minutes.

573
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:06,536
Okay, madam.

574
00:52:06,578 --> 00:52:07,327
Come this side.

575
00:52:07,327 --> 00:52:08,452
Just leave it and come.

576
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:11,828
You stay that side

577
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,244
Why the police has come?

578
00:52:13,244 --> 00:52:14,327
Why should we bother?

579
00:52:14,327 --> 00:52:15,828
Come, let's have a look
at the first floor.

580
00:52:17,703 --> 00:52:18,619
Is this the one?

581
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:19,703
Yes, madam.

582
00:52:20,494 --> 00:52:21,786
How many cameras are broken?

583
00:52:22,411 --> 00:52:24,077
This one on this floor.

584
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:29,119
Near gate 3, another camera
is broken, madam.

585
00:52:29,244 --> 00:52:30,786
What about the other floors
and the towers?

586
00:52:31,536 --> 00:52:33,494
Everything is perfect, madam.
No problem.

587
00:52:33,953 --> 00:52:36,119
The cameras on this floor and the
one near Gate 3 alone are broken...

588
00:52:37,369 --> 00:52:39,286
Any Jewellery or laptops missing?

589
00:52:39,286 --> 00:52:40,494
Nothing is missing, madam.

590
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:41,703
Everything is safe, madam.

591
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,202
Who resides in those two flats?

592
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:47,494
I'm staying in that flat.

593
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:49,411
Daisy stays in the opposite flat.

594
00:52:49,995 --> 00:52:50,661
In this flat?

595
00:52:52,744 --> 00:52:54,077
Thilak stays here.

596
00:52:56,036 --> 00:52:56,703
Hey, hi.

597
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,619
Hi, Tilak.
-Is everything safe in your home?

598
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:00,286
Yeah, safe only, madam.

599
00:53:00,286 --> 00:53:01,703
Ask the women at home
and tell.

600
00:53:01,828 --> 00:53:03,119
He is single, mam.

601
00:53:03,828 --> 00:53:05,661
You?
-I'm Thara.

602
00:53:07,036 --> 00:53:07,995
I'm staying alone, mam.

603
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:09,494
What about K 13?

604
00:53:10,411 --> 00:53:11,536
No one is there.

605
00:53:11,995 --> 00:53:14,452
No, I saw Malar's car in the parking.

606
00:53:14,828 --> 00:53:15,828
I don't know.

607
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:16,911
Sukku,
-madam.

608
00:53:16,953 --> 00:53:18,244
Check it out.
-okay.

609
00:53:27,995 --> 00:53:29,494
Looks like no one is there.

610
00:53:29,953 --> 00:53:30,411
Okay.

611
00:53:30,411 --> 00:53:30,911
Come.

612
00:53:31,828 --> 00:53:32,995
Sir,
-madam.

613
00:53:32,995 --> 00:53:34,327
I need to watch the CCTV footage.

614
00:53:34,452 --> 00:53:35,077
Should we go down?

615
00:53:35,077 --> 00:53:36,202
Not necessary, madam.

616
00:53:36,911 --> 00:53:37,869
Thara,
-yeah.

617
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:38,828
You can watch it right here, madam.

618
00:53:39,202 --> 00:53:39,703
Here, mam.

619
00:53:43,911 --> 00:53:45,244
Nothing is recorded
beyond this, right?

620
00:53:45,244 --> 00:53:45,703
No, mam

621
00:53:50,286 --> 00:53:52,411
He walks under the camera...

622
00:53:53,452 --> 00:53:54,327
And has hit like this.

623
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,661
This camera doesn't cover
the fire exit right?

624
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:04,619
Earlier, I told him to fix
the camera there.

625
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,494
He denied saying as budget issue.

626
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:08,160
Is it enough to be a President?

627
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,536
You're smart.

628
00:54:09,536 --> 00:54:12,119
I was pleading everyone for this.

629
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:14,828
Now for the broken camera,
I've to plead everyone.

630
00:54:14,828 --> 00:54:17,661
Mam, three naughty boys
are there in this floor.

631
00:54:17,661 --> 00:54:19,160
They might've done this.

632
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,411
Are the children able to touch it?

633
00:54:21,411 --> 00:54:23,327
Can't they touch?

634
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:26,536
Mam, he is telling lies.

635
00:54:26,536 --> 00:54:28,369
I'll a file case on him.

636
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:30,160
Yeah, they're just born!

637
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,369
Last week, they've broken
the side view mirror.

638
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:39,202
Not only that, they pissed on the
 exhaust fan which is ten feet above.

639
00:54:39,202 --> 00:54:41,619
What's the link between these?

640
00:54:43,036 --> 00:54:44,202
Is there camera in terrace?

641
00:54:44,202 --> 00:54:44,953
No, Madam.

642
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:46,911
At which gate is K13's car park?

643
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,119
Gate 3, mam.

644
00:54:50,077 --> 00:54:51,411
On this floor and gate 3,

645
00:54:51,452 --> 00:54:52,828
He has broken the
cameras in specific.

646
00:54:53,703 --> 00:54:54,703
The girl is not home.

647
00:54:55,202 --> 00:54:55,911
But, the car is here.

648
00:54:55,911 --> 00:54:56,369
Yeah. mam.

649
00:54:56,369 --> 00:54:59,202
Mam, she often goes out like this.

650
00:54:59,578 --> 00:55:00,036
So?

651
00:55:01,661 --> 00:55:03,286
No mam, I'm just saying.

652
00:55:03,911 --> 00:55:05,369
Do the cameras breaks
this often as well?

653
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,411
Call her, sir.

654
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:09,160
What happened?
-don't know.

655
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,202
The number...

656
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:12,119
Contact number.

657
00:55:12,327 --> 00:55:13,160
I have, mam

658
00:55:13,494 --> 00:55:14,828
Please, hold on.
I'll call.

659
00:55:19,494 --> 00:55:20,286
Excuse me, mam.

660
00:55:23,869 --> 00:55:25,286
It's switched off.

661
00:55:25,911 --> 00:55:26,911
Shall we break the door, mam?
-spare...

662
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:27,995
Why?

663
00:55:28,286 --> 00:55:28,911
Sorry, mam.

664
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:30,286
Go and check there.

665
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,744
Are there any spare keys
in the association?

666
00:55:32,744 --> 00:55:33,828
Or with the room mates?

667
00:55:33,828 --> 00:55:35,536
Spare keys...

668
00:55:35,578 --> 00:55:36,911
He must be aware.

669
00:55:36,953 --> 00:55:38,411
One Pavithra used to live here.

670
00:55:40,995 --> 00:55:42,619
She has vacated now.

671
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:44,619
Malar stays all alone.

672
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:46,703
She doesn't move with anyone.

673
00:55:46,953 --> 00:55:48,036
Do you have Pavithra's contact number?

674
00:55:48,036 --> 00:55:49,327
Yeah, I'm already calling mam.

675
00:55:58,036 --> 00:55:59,911
She is not answering, mam.
-Keep trying.

676
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:06,411
Hello.

677
00:56:06,828 --> 00:56:07,411
Hello, sister.

678
00:56:07,786 --> 00:56:08,744
I'm Thara, here.

679
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:10,619
Thara, I'm driving right now.
I'll call you later.

680
00:56:10,828 --> 00:56:12,286
Madam,  I'm Thangam.

681
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,036
B4 police station, SI.

682
00:56:14,286 --> 00:56:15,202
A small situation.

683
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:16,369
Tell me, mam.

684
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:19,703
You stayed with Malar in K 13 right.

685
00:56:20,036 --> 00:56:22,036
Im being told that you hold
a spare key of K13.

686
00:56:22,244 --> 00:56:23,369
We are in need of it now.

687
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:25,494
What happened?

688
00:56:26,077 --> 00:56:26,619
Nothing.

689
00:56:27,036 --> 00:56:28,578
Just a suspicious activity.

690
00:56:28,578 --> 00:56:29,786
A minor checking, that's all.

691
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:31,202
No, mam.

692
00:56:31,369 --> 00:56:32,536
I can't come now.

693
00:56:32,786 --> 00:56:34,619
Madam, you must definitely come.

694
00:56:34,786 --> 00:56:35,995
The key is at home.

695
00:56:35,995 --> 00:56:37,494
I'm at Maraimalai Nagar.

696
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:39,744
It'll be 8 PM by the time
I reach in this busy traffic.

697
00:56:39,744 --> 00:56:41,160
It's okay, I will wait.

698
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:41,828
Get the key.

699
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:43,703
Hang up.
-Hello, mam.

700
00:56:50,578 --> 00:56:52,286
I am aware the shameful
act she did right?!

701
00:56:52,286 --> 00:56:53,703
Vijay, please.

702
00:56:53,703 --> 00:56:55,494
You're a psycho.

703
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:57,744
You are a traitor.

704
00:56:58,244 --> 00:56:59,160
I curse you.

705
00:56:59,744 --> 00:57:00,828
You'll regret this.

706
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:07,411
Madam, got the keys.

707
00:57:08,077 --> 00:57:09,494
Folks are getting the master keys.

708
00:57:09,494 --> 00:57:10,411
Okay.

709
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:11,744
Thank you.
-Welcome, mam.

710
00:57:18,327 --> 00:57:20,036
The CCTV camera is broken.

711
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,828
Feud with a girl.

712
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:25,619
Another one took
takes your parcel by lying.

713
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:28,953
Didn't you kill yourself then?

714
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:31,202
Someone has...

715
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:33,828
What is happening here?

716
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,953
If something doesn't happen to us,

717
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:39,703
may be it is good for us.

718
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:41,953
How long to wait?

719
00:58:07,077 --> 00:58:08,286
Don't mistake me, Mathi.

720
00:58:08,828 --> 00:58:10,160
Even money is not an issue.

721
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,494
Who will worry about your life
 other than me?

722
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:17,703
If an incident didn't happen for us,
it might be for our good.

723
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,661
But, how long to wait?

724
00:58:20,995 --> 00:58:26,202
Being with your dad, I've seen
the pain of not knowing...

725
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:28,911
...when a good thing
will happen next.

726
00:58:29,536 --> 00:58:30,244
It's enough!

727
00:58:32,244 --> 00:58:33,661
I'm saying for your goodness.

728
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:35,744
You take this whole year.

729
00:58:36,077 --> 00:58:37,244
But, this is the last year.

730
00:58:38,202 --> 00:58:40,494
Else, uncle is having
the offer letter ready.

731
00:58:45,911 --> 00:58:47,286
You take this whole year.

732
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:48,786
But, this is the last year.

733
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:08,314
Hey, dirty brat you are!

734
01:03:09,064 --> 01:03:12,147
You always think the same, idiot.

735
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:15,814
No, I won't.

736
01:03:16,356 --> 01:03:18,648
Can't you think of anything else?

737
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:27,314
Okay, enough.
Greedy bugger.

738
01:03:27,314 --> 01:03:29,606
The cops have come.

739
01:03:32,814 --> 01:03:34,814
Yeah, bye...
Bye.

740
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:04,022
I called you to take the
clothes as it's going to rain.

741
01:04:04,064 --> 01:04:05,606
How long should I wait for you?

742
01:04:05,606 --> 01:04:07,981
Sister, don't you know?

743
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:12,523
This lift halts in every floor
for ten minutes like a town bus.

744
01:04:12,523 --> 01:04:13,398
Come on.

745
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:21,231
Have the children gone to school?

746
01:04:21,231 --> 01:04:22,523
Yes, they've.

747
01:04:22,523 --> 01:04:23,606
Is your husband fine?

748
01:04:23,606 --> 01:04:24,231
He is fine.

749
01:04:24,273 --> 01:04:25,439
Did you take him to hospital?

750
01:04:26,106 --> 01:04:27,147
I took him.

751
01:04:27,147 --> 01:04:28,231
Is your livelihood going on?

752
01:04:28,273 --> 01:04:29,356
Somehow it's going on.

753
01:04:29,356 --> 01:04:29,814
Okay, come.

754
01:04:33,147 --> 01:04:34,814
Shit, wastrel.

755
01:04:34,855 --> 01:04:37,314
How many times have I told
not to use our ropes.

756
01:04:37,314 --> 01:04:38,022
Who is that?

757
01:04:38,273 --> 01:04:39,939
is that the K4, Christian folks?

758
01:04:39,939 --> 01:04:41,523
That lunatic..

759
01:04:41,523 --> 01:04:44,231
She frenzied upon me as
I left the job last year without informing her.

760
01:04:44,273 --> 01:04:45,648
I'll throw away everything now.

761
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,731
No, don't do that.
Police is standing.

762
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:49,022
Why unnecessarily get into trouble?

763
01:04:49,022 --> 01:04:50,564
Inform the house owner.
-Damn!.

764
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:52,356
Let's find that out today, whos the boss!
Come, let's go.

765
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:54,648
Wait, I will take the clothes
and come.

766
01:04:54,855 --> 01:04:55,897
Oh no.

767
01:05:01,855 --> 01:05:03,439
All keys look the same.

768
01:05:05,814 --> 01:05:07,231
It's not working out.
Leave it, Sukku.

769
01:05:08,356 --> 01:05:08,814
Sir,

770
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:09,981
Tell me, madam.

771
01:05:09,981 --> 01:05:11,939
Sir, we'll check after
that girl brings the key.

772
01:05:12,022 --> 01:05:12,439
Okay, madam.

773
01:05:12,439 --> 01:05:14,814
Can you tell me, where is the
bathroom window of this flat?

774
01:05:14,814 --> 01:05:15,897
It can be seen from the terrace, madam.

775
01:05:16,106 --> 01:05:17,648
Sukku, let's go and check.
-Okay, madam.

776
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:19,022
How come none of the Master key fits?

777
01:05:19,022 --> 01:05:21,314
Those are the old keys
from the builders, madam.

778
01:05:21,314 --> 01:05:23,439
Most of the owners,
 have replaced the locks!

779
01:05:23,772 --> 01:05:24,814
Is the lift not required?

780
01:05:24,855 --> 01:05:26,314
This is the last floor, madam.

781
01:05:26,314 --> 01:05:28,022
We can can take these stairs.

782
01:06:10,481 --> 01:06:13,189
Sir, which side is the
Bathroom window of K13

783
01:06:13,314 --> 01:06:13,981
This way madam.

784
01:06:13,981 --> 01:06:15,147
Watch it madam!

785
01:06:15,189 --> 01:06:18,189
We are throwing a B'day party
this evening on the terrace..

786
01:06:18,606 --> 01:06:20,814
and the cameras are broken now..

787
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:24,022
hence we got concerned
and called the station.

788
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:24,939
Nothing to worry sir!

789
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,731
I have asked 2 more constables
to come down

790
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:28,022
If someone can take them around..

791
01:06:28,064 --> 01:06:29,147
We can inspect all the blocks.

792
01:06:29,147 --> 01:06:29,814
Okay madam!

793
01:06:29,814 --> 01:06:30,981
Can we check that side madam?

794
01:06:59,731 --> 01:07:00,981
We got something between us!

795
01:07:02,273 --> 01:07:03,648
You're not letting go of me!

796
01:07:05,398 --> 01:07:07,939
You could've told me about your
problems before you died.

797
01:07:09,064 --> 01:07:10,439
What have you done now!

798
01:07:56,314 --> 01:07:56,814
Hey.

799
01:08:11,356 --> 01:08:12,231
What's your contact number?

800
01:08:12,231 --> 01:08:15,606
9597 592 682

801
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:22,147
Is this the broken camera?
-Yes.

802
01:08:22,147 --> 01:08:23,398
Hello, sir.
It's the courier boy speaking.

803
01:08:23,398 --> 01:08:24,147
Yeah tell me.

804
01:08:24,147 --> 01:08:25,648
Can you come to
the security room?

805
01:08:25,648 --> 01:08:27,523
Nothing else is broken.
Everything is perfect.

806
01:08:27,855 --> 01:08:29,106
Which is the parking of K13?

807
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:29,648
Why?
-this only,madam.

808
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:30,648
It's urgent, sir.

809
01:08:31,606 --> 01:08:33,439
Are you coming?
Or shall I come?

810
01:08:33,564 --> 01:08:35,189
Gate 3 is on this side.

811
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,022
This camera will cover
this entire area.

812
01:08:37,022 --> 01:08:39,189
That way will lead you to main gate.

813
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:40,356
You stay there, bro.

814
01:08:40,814 --> 01:08:42,939
Just tell me where you're.
I'll come over there in person.

815
01:08:43,064 --> 01:08:44,648
I'll stay connected.
You come over.

816
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:23,147
Hello sir, where are you?

817
01:09:23,147 --> 01:09:25,231
Bro, I'm almost there.
Will reach in 2minutes.

818
01:09:30,523 --> 01:09:30,897
Hello?

819
01:09:33,356 --> 01:09:33,731
Bro?

820
01:09:42,064 --> 01:09:42,439
Hello?

821
01:09:49,564 --> 01:09:49,981
Hello?

822
01:09:54,981 --> 01:09:55,398
Bro?

823
01:09:58,606 --> 01:09:59,606
Bro,where are you?

824
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:02,648
Hello, answer me bro.

825
01:10:02,897 --> 01:10:03,772
Yes sir.

826
01:10:03,772 --> 01:10:04,439
Oh no.

827
01:10:04,481 --> 01:10:07,022
Delivering the parcel to you
has created a big issue.

828
01:10:07,481 --> 01:10:08,981
The parcel needs to be delivered
only to the madam.

829
01:10:08,981 --> 01:10:10,189
Can you please return it?

830
01:10:10,189 --> 01:10:11,231
Return...?

831
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:13,106
Bro, I will give it to her myself.

832
01:10:13,106 --> 01:10:15,314
Sir, this will lead to unwated issues...

833
01:10:15,314 --> 01:10:18,648
and it might even reach the police..

834
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:20,606
Bro, what's the necessity
for the police?

835
01:10:20,939 --> 01:10:23,648
Bro, tell me where you're.
I'll come and talk to you in person.

836
01:10:24,022 --> 01:10:27,523
You better get the gift.

837
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:29,981
Bro, it was me who sent the parcel.

838
01:10:30,273 --> 01:10:32,523
Bro, it's one sided love.
Please understand.

839
01:10:32,523 --> 01:10:34,356
She doomed me at the pub,
last night.

840
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:36,606
She warned me, that if she receives
the parcel, I'll get caught by the police.

841
01:10:36,606 --> 01:10:38,189
And make sure
the parcel remains undelivered

842
01:10:38,189 --> 01:10:39,731
She said this to me sternly.

843
01:10:39,731 --> 01:10:41,398
Please understand me bro.

844
01:10:41,398 --> 01:10:43,231
I plead you to leave this matter right here.

845
01:10:49,064 --> 01:10:49,439
Bro?

846
01:10:51,273 --> 01:10:51,731
Bro?

847
01:10:52,772 --> 01:10:54,147
Speak out, bro.

848
01:10:55,106 --> 01:10:55,648
Bro?

849
01:10:56,398 --> 01:10:57,439
Bro, where are you?

850
01:10:58,981 --> 01:10:59,398
Bro?

851
01:11:01,314 --> 01:11:03,356
Speak out, bro.
Are you there?

852
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:05,564
Bro?

853
01:11:06,648 --> 01:11:07,814
It's not an issue, bro.

854
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:09,772
Lets drop this!

855
01:11:10,064 --> 01:11:10,731
Thanks, bro.

856
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:15,772
Come, let's have a cup of tea!

857
01:11:15,981 --> 01:11:17,731
No need, bro.

858
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:19,189
Then an important issue, bro.

859
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:22,189
Don't call back to this number.
it's official number.

860
01:11:22,273 --> 01:11:25,022
Oh, no. I won't call you again.
It's a promise.

861
01:11:25,022 --> 01:11:27,231
I promise, I won't disturb you.
Why would I?

862
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,231
Thanks, bro.

863
01:11:28,855 --> 01:11:29,648
Sorry, bro.

864
01:11:38,398 --> 01:11:39,814
Nikhil, where are you going?

865
01:11:40,189 --> 01:11:42,022
The ball has gone inside
Thilak uncle's house mom.

866
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:43,022
I'll pick it up.

867
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,564
Nikhil!

868
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,981
Coming mom.

869
01:12:01,564 --> 01:12:03,606
I'm going to throw that ball, today.

870
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:50,731
Take that chair.

871
01:12:58,564 --> 01:13:00,356
Is it over?
-Yes, sir. Done.

872
01:13:00,855 --> 01:13:01,106
Okay.

873
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,356
You can leave.
-Bye, Sir.

874
01:13:02,523 --> 01:13:02,981
Thanks sir.

875
01:13:06,231 --> 01:13:07,981
Come, let's go by the steps.
-Yeah, come.

876
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:09,606
Have the police men lgone?

877
01:13:09,606 --> 01:13:11,356
No, they're still around.

878
01:14:01,064 --> 01:14:02,439
Forgive me, Pavi.

879
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,814
No, you won't.

880
01:14:06,398 --> 01:14:09,814
Just talk to me once.

881
01:14:11,273 --> 01:14:11,814
Please.

882
01:14:13,314 --> 01:14:15,231
I was alone even before you came.

883
01:14:16,731 --> 01:14:17,939
It's not new.

884
01:14:19,356 --> 01:14:22,814
But, talk to me once.

885
01:14:23,606 --> 01:14:24,814
I didn't do wantedly.

886
01:14:26,855 --> 01:14:30,564
I swear, I didn't expect that Vijay
will come to know about this.

887
01:14:33,606 --> 01:14:35,106
Why did you make me
come here?

888
01:14:35,523 --> 01:14:37,022
This is not going to
change anything.

889
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:41,981
Vijay, I made you to come.

890
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:44,981
Vijay, please.

891
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:48,189
My guilt will kill me.

892
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:50,564
Are you joking?

893
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:51,897
Who the hell are you?

894
01:14:52,897 --> 01:14:54,772
Why should I care
 if you feel guilty.

895
01:14:54,981 --> 01:14:55,439
Bullshit

896
01:14:55,814 --> 01:14:57,439
Don't waste my time.
-Vijay, please.

897
01:14:58,106 --> 01:14:59,147
I plead you.

898
01:14:59,481 --> 01:15:00,648
At least, for me?

899
01:15:01,147 --> 01:15:02,147
For you?

900
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:06,648
You've done a story on
the private life of your friend

901
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:08,189
Just for your fame and name,

902
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:09,523
And minted money from that.

903
01:15:09,523 --> 01:15:11,814
For such a damn cheap person like you.

904
01:15:12,523 --> 01:15:14,231
But, you're least of my worry.

905
01:15:15,398 --> 01:15:20,147
But, no one betrayed me
like you in my life.

906
01:15:20,273 --> 01:15:21,523
Vijay, please.

907
01:15:21,523 --> 01:15:23,022
I'm sorry.
-Shut up.

908
01:15:23,064 --> 01:15:23,981
Don't say sorry.

909
01:15:24,564 --> 01:15:25,606
Don't say sorry.

910
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:31,314
Are you both enacting a drama?

911
01:15:33,231 --> 01:15:35,147
We couldn't have a child for 8 years..

912
01:15:35,398 --> 01:15:36,939
Without the husband's knowledge..

913
01:15:37,064 --> 01:15:40,897
With the help of your colleague,
Anand..

914
01:15:40,897 --> 01:15:44,231
You've given birth to a child
by artificial insemination...

915
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:47,731
You cite the reason as for the
child and for the family

916
01:15:47,731 --> 01:15:48,106
Shit.

917
01:15:49,398 --> 01:15:51,523
Vijay, you didn't come for check-up.
-don't you dare.

918
01:15:51,939 --> 01:15:53,231
Don't you dare.

919
01:15:54,481 --> 01:15:56,022
Dare to blame me.

920
01:15:56,398 --> 01:15:58,147
Yes, I didn't come for the check up.

921
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:02,022
So, can't we live
without a child?

922
01:16:02,147 --> 01:16:03,439
Or can't we wait?

923
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:06,439
When husband is working away,

924
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:09,564
You slept with someone and
speaking like a martyr.

925
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:11,022
Vijay,
-Vijay, no.

926
01:16:11,648 --> 01:16:14,814
Oh no...no...

927
01:16:14,814 --> 01:16:16,022
Vijay read this book,

928
01:16:16,064 --> 01:16:17,147
you'll understand.

929
01:16:20,106 --> 01:16:20,897
Are you mad?

930
01:16:21,606 --> 01:16:24,147
I'm have written facts from her side.

931
01:16:24,731 --> 01:16:26,648
Hiding her shameful act from me..

932
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,439
And you've told the whole world about it..

933
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:28,897
Damn!

934
01:16:29,273 --> 01:16:32,314
No one knows its your story!

935
01:16:32,314 --> 01:16:32,897
Please.

936
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:34,606
But, I know.

937
01:16:35,106 --> 01:16:36,939
I know of her shameful act right?!

938
01:16:38,189 --> 01:16:41,814
By this time Anand would've
announced it to the whole world.

939
01:16:42,273 --> 01:16:43,897
But, thanks to you.

940
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:47,022
I wouldn't have known anything
about her, if it wasn't for you.

941
01:16:48,356 --> 01:16:50,231
Vijay, please.
-Stop it.

942
01:16:51,147 --> 01:16:52,147
Lunatics!

943
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:53,606
Both of you!

944
01:16:54,147 --> 01:16:55,939
You're a psycho.

945
01:16:56,314 --> 01:16:58,314
You, a betrayer.

946
01:17:04,064 --> 01:17:06,022
I can't believe this
is all happening.

947
01:17:07,731 --> 01:17:11,564
Do you know now,
why no one is with you?

948
01:17:14,106 --> 01:17:15,398
Because, you're a monster.

949
01:17:19,398 --> 01:17:26,231
In this entire world, the sensitive
issue which is known only to me and Anand,

950
01:17:26,273 --> 01:17:29,106
I told you being unable to
bear the mental agony.

951
01:17:29,106 --> 01:17:30,022
I trusted you.

952
01:17:30,772 --> 01:17:32,564
I trusted you more than anyone.

953
01:17:35,648 --> 01:17:39,814
You shattered the whole
purpose of my act

954
01:17:41,731 --> 01:17:48,439
You never see the people around you
as humans made of flesh and blood.

955
01:17:50,147 --> 01:17:51,523
Everything is a story for you.

956
01:17:52,606 --> 01:17:54,189
Everyone are characters.

957
01:17:55,022 --> 01:17:55,939
I curse you.

958
01:17:57,064 --> 01:17:58,147
You'll regret this.

959
01:18:11,106 --> 01:18:12,730
Hello,
Where are you?

960
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:15,439
Mam, it'll take 45 minutes for
me to reach.

961
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:16,730
Okay, come.

962
01:18:16,981 --> 01:18:17,647
Okay, mam.

963
01:18:19,814 --> 01:18:24,147
I just took the plot from
what you said as an inspiration,

964
01:18:24,147 --> 01:18:26,647
And wrote the story
justifying your act.

965
01:18:28,772 --> 01:18:31,939
I miscalculated that
no one is going to know the source.

966
01:18:35,106 --> 01:18:38,106
Wonder, how Vijay came
to know about this.

967
01:18:39,605 --> 01:18:45,814
Writers will go to any
extreme for the sake of the stories.

968
01:18:47,106 --> 01:18:50,231
But, I won't be forgiven.

969
01:20:09,231 --> 01:20:12,480
Definitely, you'll feel reluctant
to talk to a stranger.

970
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,605
That too to a psychiatrist,
with this kind of attire.

971
01:20:15,605 --> 01:20:17,356
It's even more difficult, isn't it?

972
01:20:19,855 --> 01:20:22,022
But, you need not talk to us.

973
01:20:22,189 --> 01:20:23,522
We have a special
arrangement  for you.

974
01:20:23,939 --> 01:20:25,356
Someone just like you but,

975
01:20:25,356 --> 01:20:28,605
out of depression!
You can talk to her right?

976
01:20:31,147 --> 01:20:33,189
How do I talk to someone stranger about this?

977
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:34,231
Not just a stranger.

978
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:35,605
To a person who has come out
of depression.

979
01:20:35,647 --> 01:20:37,314
Both of you won't know each other.

980
01:20:37,314 --> 01:20:39,314
You talk to such a person right?

981
01:21:05,522 --> 01:21:05,939
Hi,

982
01:21:09,563 --> 01:21:10,022
Hi,

983
01:21:11,855 --> 01:21:12,730
Why did you come here?

984
01:21:17,855 --> 01:21:19,106
Why did you come here?

985
01:21:22,022 --> 01:21:23,106
Why have you come?

986
01:21:26,231 --> 01:21:28,605
If I feel like talking to someone,

987
01:21:29,106 --> 01:21:29,855
I'll come here.

988
01:21:31,563 --> 01:21:32,022
Tell me.

989
01:21:33,272 --> 01:21:34,106
Why have you come?

990
01:21:36,814 --> 01:21:37,605
Depression.

991
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,730
Who told you that
you're in depression?

992
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:42,272
What's this question?

993
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:43,939
I know that.

994
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:47,730
Even my friends told.

995
01:21:48,855 --> 01:21:51,106
How did they say that?

996
01:21:54,064 --> 01:21:55,064
I am a loner.

997
01:21:56,772 --> 01:21:58,064
I won't talk to anyone.

998
01:21:59,563 --> 01:22:02,480
Even if I talk, I will get angry.

999
01:22:05,272 --> 01:22:05,897
Okay.

1000
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:09,189
But, who told you cannot to be like this?

1001
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:17,231
If we don't behave to other's expectations,

1002
01:22:17,689 --> 01:22:18,939
Is that a disease?

1003
01:22:20,231 --> 01:22:22,231
Look at the world around us.

1004
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:26,106
Would you even feel to
get along with them?

1005
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:31,730
What's wrong in wanting to be alone?

1006
01:22:37,022 --> 01:22:38,398
Don't you have friends?

1007
01:22:39,398 --> 01:22:40,064
There was one.

1008
01:22:42,106 --> 01:22:42,814
I lost her.

1009
01:22:47,522 --> 01:22:48,647
We'll talk about you.

1010
01:22:49,605 --> 01:22:50,022
Okay.

1011
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:52,189
What are you doing?

1012
01:22:53,981 --> 01:22:56,314
I'm an assistant director in cinema.

1013
01:22:57,814 --> 01:22:59,939
I have a story, waiting for the producer.

1014
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,398
Do you write stories?

1015
01:23:03,855 --> 01:23:05,398
Stories are my lifelines!

1016
01:23:06,939 --> 01:23:12,189
I had written a story,
shot for ten days and got stalled.

1017
01:23:14,106 --> 01:23:17,231
Post that, I couldn't write...

1018
01:23:19,106 --> 01:23:19,939
Writer's block.

1019
01:23:20,522 --> 01:23:21,314
Yes.

1020
01:23:21,356 --> 01:23:22,272
How do you know?

1021
01:23:23,314 --> 01:23:24,064
I write too..

1022
01:23:24,981 --> 01:23:26,939
Oh, for cinema?

1023
01:23:27,897 --> 01:23:28,522
No.

1024
01:23:32,272 --> 01:23:34,106
Let's talk only about you.

1025
01:23:36,605 --> 01:23:39,689
But, don't we need
solitude for writing?

1026
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:41,730
What is the need for treatment?

1027
01:23:44,356 --> 01:23:46,439
I'm in the same field for ten years.

1028
01:23:50,106 --> 01:23:51,730
With the doubt lingering
over my break..

1029
01:23:53,314 --> 01:23:54,855
and being unable to write anything..

1030
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,689
I have even thought of killing myself.

1031
01:24:02,272 --> 01:24:03,730
Haven't you ever felt like this?

1032
01:24:05,147 --> 01:24:06,480
Many times.

1033
01:24:07,398 --> 01:24:08,730
How did you come out of it?

1034
01:24:09,981 --> 01:24:11,522
Who told you, I'm out of it?

1035
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:13,272
What are you saying?

1036
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:16,106
Your name?

1037
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:18,314
You tell me.

1038
01:24:18,897 --> 01:24:19,522
Then, I'll tell you.

1039
01:24:20,939 --> 01:24:21,398
Mathi.

1040
01:24:23,064 --> 01:24:23,730
Mathiazhagan.

1041
01:24:25,272 --> 01:24:25,939
Your name?

1042
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:30,647
Hello.
Hey...

1043
01:24:31,314 --> 01:24:31,689
Hello.

1044
01:25:28,814 --> 01:25:30,605
The climax is a mess!

1045
01:25:30,605 --> 01:25:33,272
Some dude named Go-Pro Gopal
ruined the whole show.

1046
01:25:33,314 --> 01:25:35,356
The drones are flying all over.

1047
01:25:35,356 --> 01:25:36,272
On the whole, film is a flop.

1048
01:25:36,314 --> 01:25:37,064
It's good film, dude.

1049
01:25:37,064 --> 01:25:38,189
It's sparking, bro.

1050
01:25:38,189 --> 01:25:39,064
It's superb, dude.

1051
01:25:39,064 --> 01:25:40,897
Bro, just a minute.
How was the movie?

1052
01:25:40,897 --> 01:25:42,064
It was good.

1053
01:25:42,772 --> 01:25:44,897
Actually, I'm an assistant
director of this film.

1054
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:45,689
Really?
-yes.

1055
01:25:45,689 --> 01:25:48,897
The other person rubbished the film,
what do you think about it?

1056
01:25:49,522 --> 01:25:52,147
We slogged for two years,

1057
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,897
But, he put down the film
in two minutes.

1058
01:25:53,939 --> 01:25:55,689
That's his wish.

1059
01:25:59,605 --> 01:26:01,480
Actually, I'm an assistant
director of this film.

1060
01:26:19,314 --> 01:26:20,189
Hey, friends.

1061
01:26:20,272 --> 01:26:21,439
Shyam bro's treat it is!

1062
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:22,689
We are going to abduct
the writer.

1063
01:26:22,689 --> 01:26:23,064
Okay?

1064
01:26:23,106 --> 01:26:24,064
Come...come...

1065
01:26:24,106 --> 01:26:24,855
Brother...

1066
01:26:25,189 --> 01:26:26,563
Hey, why did you
guys come here?

1067
01:26:26,563 --> 01:26:27,272
Come...come...

1068
01:26:27,272 --> 01:26:28,689
What's this? It's similar to
an investigation room.

1069
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:29,064
Come...

1070
01:26:29,106 --> 01:26:30,772
If you tell me its just cinema..

1071
01:26:30,939 --> 01:26:32,272
I will take your life just like that!

1072
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:34,064
I'm not coming.
-hey, come on.

1073
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:35,855
How can you do like this?
-I'm not coming.

1074
01:26:35,855 --> 01:26:37,439
You go.
I'm not coming.

1075
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:38,189
Hey, come.

1076
01:26:38,189 --> 01:26:39,272
I'm not coming.
Please.

1077
01:26:39,314 --> 01:26:40,689
Come...
-please.

1078
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:41,480
Come on, bro.

1079
01:26:41,897 --> 01:26:43,689
You might get your story,
even there. Come on!

1080
01:27:25,356 --> 01:27:28,772
Actually, I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

1081
01:27:29,522 --> 01:27:30,480
Hey, hey...

1082
01:27:30,855 --> 01:27:32,480
Take it easy, director sir.

1083
01:27:34,939 --> 01:27:35,981
Sorry, okay.

1084
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:38,064
I am high and..

1085
01:27:39,147 --> 01:27:40,439
You know, sorry.

1086
01:27:41,897 --> 01:27:42,647
Not that,

1087
01:27:43,106 --> 01:27:43,772
It's okay.

1088
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:46,689
I'm just saying not now.

1089
01:27:48,939 --> 01:27:50,480
What do you want now?

1090
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:53,772
You heard, right?

1091
01:27:54,981 --> 01:27:56,480
What do you want now?

1092
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,480
Trick question?

1093
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:02,563
Let it be.

1094
01:28:03,522 --> 01:28:04,022
Tell,

1095
01:28:05,189 --> 01:28:06,356
what do you want now?

1096
01:28:09,147 --> 01:28:13,439
At the moment, the only thing
 on my mind is to write a good story.

1097
01:28:15,689 --> 01:28:18,981
It must be stunning when heard.

1098
01:28:19,356 --> 01:28:21,272
Different!

1099
01:28:21,772 --> 01:28:23,981
Nobody should've done
something like that.

1100
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:26,563
Even today, when I started
to this place

1101
01:28:27,647 --> 01:28:29,272
I wasn't interested.

1102
01:28:29,605 --> 01:28:30,480
But you know,

1103
01:28:30,981 --> 01:28:33,272
we both met each other,

1104
01:28:33,814 --> 01:28:36,231
Now, I'm not interested to
leave from here.

1105
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:39,689
Shall I tell?

1106
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:42,480
A story line?

1107
01:28:43,647 --> 01:28:44,855
I must think.

1108
01:28:45,605 --> 01:28:49,689
Only when it comes from my
 I get the kick!

1109
01:28:51,981 --> 01:28:54,897
Still, let me be your inspiration.

1110
01:28:55,398 --> 01:28:56,480
Inspiration?

1111
01:28:57,064 --> 01:28:59,398
I know you'll be an awesome inspiration.

1112
01:29:00,064 --> 01:29:02,689
But you know, this matter is...

1113
01:29:13,522 --> 01:29:16,022
My place.

1114
01:29:16,522 --> 01:29:17,356
Now?

1115
01:29:19,106 --> 01:29:20,647
Okay, I'll tell my friends.

1116
01:29:22,897 --> 01:29:24,356
Don't tell them about me.

1117
01:29:26,563 --> 01:29:27,439
And,

1118
01:29:27,939 --> 01:29:28,981
Let's not leave together.

1119
01:29:30,522 --> 01:29:31,981
I'll pick you up at the signal.

1120
01:29:36,772 --> 01:29:38,356
I will neither tell about you...

1121
01:29:39,147 --> 01:29:41,855
…nor about coming to your house...

1122
01:29:41,855 --> 01:29:44,480
nor about what is going to happen there!

1123
01:29:53,538 --> 01:29:55,371
How long will it take to
reach your place?

1124
01:29:55,788 --> 01:29:56,663
Just five minutes.

1125
01:29:57,288 --> 01:29:58,871
My house is nearby.

1126
01:30:00,121 --> 01:30:00,871
Okay.

1127
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:04,788
Tell me about you.

1128
01:30:06,705 --> 01:30:07,997
About me...

1129
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:10,871
Nothing  much to say!

1130
01:30:10,871 --> 01:30:11,955
I'm from a middle class family.

1131
01:30:13,746 --> 01:30:15,788
I left my parents
and staying alone.

1132
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:19,746
Actually, there is no reason in particular.

1133
01:30:21,121 --> 01:30:22,204
They didn't like me.

1134
01:30:23,038 --> 01:30:23,997
I didn't like them.

1135
01:30:25,413 --> 01:30:26,997
I have my own rules.

1136
01:30:27,204 --> 01:30:27,997
Is it?

1137
01:30:28,871 --> 01:30:29,538
Oh.

1138
01:30:30,997 --> 01:30:34,788
It's been six years
since I left my parents.

1139
01:30:35,121 --> 01:30:35,746
Oh.

1140
01:30:38,705 --> 01:30:43,246
Actually, it all started from this tattoo.

1141
01:30:45,496 --> 01:30:46,162
Looks good.

1142
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:51,079
I had one friend.

1143
01:30:53,705 --> 01:30:54,663
I lost her.

1144
01:30:56,913 --> 01:30:59,204
That too because of my writing.

1145
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:02,454
But...

1146
01:31:03,538 --> 01:31:04,746
Writing is my life.

1147
01:31:05,288 --> 01:31:05,955
For me as well.

1148
01:31:09,079 --> 01:31:14,580
Sometimes, the love for writing
blinds our eyes, isn't it?

1149
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,538
Right.

1150
01:31:18,871 --> 01:31:19,746
I don't know why.

1151
01:31:22,038 --> 01:31:25,871
I'm unable to write anything
for almost a year.

1152
01:31:31,413 --> 01:31:32,955
I think I have lost it.

1153
01:31:39,121 --> 01:31:41,663
The only friend, I had.

1154
01:31:45,496 --> 01:31:46,079
Hey,

1155
01:31:48,162 --> 01:31:49,246
Oh, no.

1156
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:52,413
I couldn't do anything else.

1157
01:31:57,413 --> 01:31:59,038
Same pinch!

1158
01:31:59,788 --> 01:32:02,329
I have all the problems
that you have.

1159
01:32:03,621 --> 01:32:04,871
But, what to do?

1160
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:08,079
Without thinking about anything,

1161
01:32:09,413 --> 01:32:10,746
Let's be happy.

1162
01:32:13,371 --> 01:32:14,079
But, one...

1163
01:32:14,454 --> 01:32:15,454
Which one?

1164
01:32:17,038 --> 01:32:18,204
I have got an idea for a new story.

1165
01:32:21,204 --> 01:32:24,204
Like asking forgiveness for my fault.

1166
01:32:29,413 --> 01:32:30,746
All the best.

1167
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:49,496
Hey, what are you doing?

1168
01:32:49,496 --> 01:32:51,329
Hey, here?

1169
01:32:53,371 --> 01:32:55,204
Mathi.

1170
01:32:55,204 --> 01:32:55,913
Can you hear?

1171
01:32:55,913 --> 01:32:57,871
I can hear you.

1172
01:33:01,913 --> 01:33:04,246
Can you hear me?

1173
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:14,162
Are you going to read now?

1174
01:33:14,162 --> 01:33:16,371
By writing someones life as a story..

1175
01:33:16,413 --> 01:33:19,288
I shattered their life...

1176
01:33:23,746 --> 01:33:27,538
By giving you an important day
of my life,

1177
01:33:28,162 --> 01:33:30,746
I decided to give you a life.

1178
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:33,788
Is the story important now?

1179
01:33:38,997 --> 01:33:43,038
Definitely, I'll be an inspiration for your story,

1180
01:33:43,538 --> 01:33:44,538
Okay.

1181
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:45,663
Mathi.

1182
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:51,038
Your next few hours
will be a big inspiration for you.

1183
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:56,496
But, you must promise me.

1184
01:33:57,121 --> 01:33:58,788
Okay, ask me.

1185
01:33:59,162 --> 01:33:59,955
In your film,

1186
01:34:02,746 --> 01:34:03,871
If you take it as a film...

1187
01:34:06,038 --> 01:34:07,162
Mention it as my story.

1188
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,496
Flash my name "Malarvizhi"!

1189
01:34:13,329 --> 01:34:13,913
I will.

1190
01:34:16,038 --> 01:34:17,162
Promise?

1191
01:34:17,162 --> 01:34:19,246
I have come here with that
purpose for that right?

1192
01:34:20,871 --> 01:34:22,246
Not just one film...

1193
01:34:23,413 --> 01:34:25,162
...I'll do that in all the films.

1194
01:34:25,913 --> 01:34:27,038
I swear.

1195
01:34:27,913 --> 01:34:28,580
Okay.

1196
01:34:29,663 --> 01:34:32,913
Your name is, Malar...

1197
01:34:35,204 --> 01:34:37,329
Malar...

1198
01:34:39,162 --> 01:34:39,955
Malarvizhi.

1199
01:35:12,913 --> 01:35:14,955
You have to mention it as My story.

1200
01:35:16,329 --> 01:35:19,162
Flash my name "Malarvizhi"

1201
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:21,162
Swear now!

1202
01:35:21,997 --> 01:35:23,162
Alright?

1203
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:28,788
Are you mad?

1204
01:36:30,204 --> 01:36:31,246
What have you done?

1205
01:36:37,705 --> 01:36:39,162
How can I ever escape from this?

1206
01:36:42,371 --> 01:36:43,955
You didn't die for my sake.

1207
01:36:43,955 --> 01:36:46,288
You've killed my dream for your sake.

1208
01:36:50,788 --> 01:36:52,496
Will anyone believe all these?

1209
01:36:53,371 --> 01:36:54,746
Inspiration?
Bullshit!

1210
01:36:54,746 --> 01:36:55,663
Did I ever ask you?

1211
01:36:57,913 --> 01:36:59,788
I'll post any damn thing on Facebook.

1212
01:36:59,830 --> 01:37:00,371
so?

1213
01:37:02,246 --> 01:37:02,663
Damn!

1214
01:37:03,162 --> 01:37:03,871
My fate.

1215
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:08,538
It's true that I was struggling.

1216
01:37:09,496 --> 01:37:10,788
But is this what you do?

1217
01:37:11,955 --> 01:37:13,038
What do you care?

1218
01:37:13,038 --> 01:37:14,038
You died in peace.

1219
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:15,580
I'm stuck.

1220
01:37:17,371 --> 01:37:19,038
Let me be your inspiration.

1221
01:37:19,955 --> 01:37:21,580
All the best.

1222
01:38:01,871 --> 01:38:03,871
Cameras are broken in this floor
and near Gate 3 in particular!

1223
01:38:24,288 --> 01:38:26,705
You had planned everything
 so that I don't get caught.

1224
01:38:29,162 --> 01:38:32,580
You believed that I'll escape from here.

1225
01:38:35,121 --> 01:38:38,663
I'll escape as you wished.

1226
01:38:58,997 --> 01:39:01,788
You could've spoken your mind
to me last night.

1227
01:39:22,997 --> 01:39:27,788
Hey, I'm on my way to the terrace.
Come fast. Just ten minutes.

1228
01:39:44,371 --> 01:39:45,371
I'm travelling for work a lot.

1229
01:39:45,413 --> 01:39:46,788
Is everything okay?
-thank you.

1230
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:47,955
Yeah...yeah....

1231
01:39:47,955 --> 01:39:50,246
Otherwise, I have no issues
with you all.

1232
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:52,538
Hey, the SI has come.
-Pavithra.

1233
01:39:52,913 --> 01:39:53,496
Hello, mam.

1234
01:39:53,955 --> 01:39:54,871
Have you brought the keys?

1235
01:39:54,871 --> 01:39:55,788
Yes, mam.

1236
01:39:58,038 --> 01:39:59,371
Now, how to go to the terrace?

1237
01:39:59,371 --> 01:40:01,288
The lift always has power backup.

1238
01:40:01,288 --> 01:40:02,496
Oh, yes.

1239
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:05,871
What is wrong with
the electricity today?

1240
01:40:05,871 --> 01:40:08,288
They have dug up near the transformer.

1241
01:40:08,288 --> 01:40:10,079
Are they turning on the generator?

1242
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:12,079
Hold on! They are are just
re-filling the diesel.

1243
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:13,788
 Will turn it on after that.

1244
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:21,371
Mention it as My story.

1245
01:40:22,329 --> 01:40:25,538
Flash my name "Malarvizhi"

1246
01:40:26,538 --> 01:40:27,788
Promise!

1247
01:40:28,663 --> 01:40:29,788
Alright!

1248
01:40:46,496 --> 01:40:47,121
Oh, no.

1249
01:40:47,121 --> 01:40:48,329
Sorry, sir.

1250
01:40:48,621 --> 01:40:50,580
Sir, isn't that you?

1251
01:40:50,621 --> 01:40:51,788
What are you doing here sir?

1252
01:40:52,038 --> 01:40:53,496
Alright Sir! Sorry Sir!...
-Dhileep sir.

1253
01:40:55,371 --> 01:40:57,580
Everyone is awaiting for you at the party.

1254
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:58,580
Producer asked to bring you.

1255
01:40:59,705 --> 01:41:01,038
My party is right here.

1256
01:41:01,496 --> 01:41:02,955
Sir, producer asked you to come.
-Dhileep.

1257
01:41:05,788 --> 01:41:06,955
What are you doing here?

1258
01:41:07,204 --> 01:41:09,580
These days, success party
is a big feat!

1259
01:41:09,788 --> 01:41:11,162
You're just standing here.

1260
01:41:11,621 --> 01:41:13,121
Everyone is waiting for you.

1261
01:41:13,246 --> 01:41:13,788
Come, let's go.

1262
01:41:14,162 --> 01:41:15,246
No, sir.
I'm leaving.

1263
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:18,496
C'mon! Why do you never
get along with anyone?

1264
01:41:19,162 --> 01:41:20,454
Come and enjoy!

1265
01:41:20,746 --> 01:41:21,955
Come.
Come, let's go.

1266
01:41:22,162 --> 01:41:23,079
No, it's okay, sir.

1267
01:41:23,079 --> 01:41:24,538
I'm leaving.
-Dude, come here.

1268
01:41:26,371 --> 01:41:26,955
Thank you.

1269
01:41:27,288 --> 01:41:28,454
Dhileep, take your advance.

1270
01:41:29,038 --> 01:41:30,746
You're doing the next film for me.
-definitely sir.

1271
01:41:31,204 --> 01:41:33,121
The heroine has arrived.
-Thank you.

1272
01:41:34,413 --> 01:41:35,162
Come.

1273
01:41:35,788 --> 01:41:37,746
Sorry, I'm late.

1274
01:41:37,746 --> 01:41:40,913
Everyone inside is talking
about you that you've acted well.

1275
01:41:41,329 --> 01:41:41,955
Thank you, sir.

1276
01:41:42,788 --> 01:41:44,329
Sir is the reason.

1277
01:41:44,329 --> 01:41:45,580
Come, let's go inside.

1278
01:41:45,621 --> 01:41:46,246
I'll come, sir.

1279
01:41:48,413 --> 01:41:50,705
Dhileep sir, aren't you coming?

1280
01:41:50,705 --> 01:41:51,955
No, I'm leaving.

1281
01:41:57,246 --> 01:41:59,663
Why he is not even coming
for the success party?

1282
01:41:59,663 --> 01:42:01,663
He is a crazier than the
girl from the film.

1283
01:42:02,121 --> 01:42:03,705
That's why the story is also similar.

1284
01:42:03,705 --> 01:42:05,746
Not at all, he is a nice person.

1285
01:42:05,746 --> 01:42:07,871
This story is an inspiration of a real incident.

1286
01:42:07,871 --> 01:42:08,496
Didn't you read?

1287
01:42:08,496 --> 01:42:11,162
In a hotel in OMR, a north Indian IT
girl went missing.

1288
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:06,955
"One fine evening!"

1289
01:43:06,955 --> 01:43:10,496
"It was Twilight"

1290
01:43:11,788 --> 01:43:15,788
"Desires spiked and masks tweaked"

1291
01:43:15,788 --> 01:43:20,162
"There she walked in to the trap,
like a bug."

1292
01:43:24,204 --> 01:43:32,788
"This world lacks the taste for art"

1293
01:43:32,871 --> 01:43:36,162
"To admire, taste and feast on it..."

1294
01:43:36,204 --> 01:43:40,871
"Show no Mercy!"
"Wait no further!"

1295
01:43:40,871 --> 01:43:55,746
"Show no Mercy!"
 "Show no Mercy!"

1296
01:44:05,162 --> 01:44:08,371
"This is a world of lethargy"

1297
01:44:08,413 --> 01:44:12,162
"It's also the world looking
for evidences"

1298
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:16,580
"No one has the love for art"

1299
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:20,371
"Nor interested to know
others' love for art"

1300
01:44:20,371 --> 01:44:24,371
"She walked in to the trap"

1301
01:44:24,413 --> 01:44:28,079
"He was in rage with
 his desire for story"

1302
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:31,580
"Rip off life, as the curtains go up"

1303
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:33,871
"Breaking the barriers!"

1304
01:44:33,871 --> 01:44:39,955
"With full of rage!"

1305
01:44:39,955 --> 01:44:44,496
Show no Mercy!
 Show no Mercy!

1306
01:44:49,079 --> 01:44:50,788
"He finished the Story!"

1307
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:52,705
"Destroyed the evidence!"

1308
01:44:52,705 --> 01:44:54,454
"Conquered the world!"

1309
01:44:56,663 --> 01:44:58,580
"He finished the Story!"

1310
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:00,371
"Destroyed the evidence!"

1311
01:45:00,371 --> 01:45:02,162
"Conquered the world!"

1312
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:07,871
"Has the night left out of hand?"

1313
01:51:34,746 --> 01:51:38,871
"Has the night left out of hand?"

1314
01:51:39,955 --> 01:51:44,705
"The breeze at night
awaits to leave"

1315
01:51:44,705 --> 01:51:50,454
"The time the demon stays"

1316
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:54,955
"Why this turbulence ?"
"The thought trembles on..."

1317
01:51:55,955 --> 01:52:00,079
"Will you escape
being caught in the stone box?"

1318
01:52:00,079 --> 01:52:06,288
"You've come close to death"

1319
01:52:06,288 --> 01:52:11,788
"You've come listening to a girl"
"No way to escape...!"

1320
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:16,955
"The fire spread as a circle!"

1321
01:52:27,997 --> 01:52:32,121
"Has the night left out of hand?"

1322
01:52:33,204 --> 01:52:37,955
"The breeze at night
awaits to leave"

1323
01:52:37,955 --> 01:52:43,705
"The time the demon stays"

1324
01:52:43,705 --> 01:52:48,246
"Why this turbulence ?"
"The thought trembles on..."

1325
01:53:30,746 --> 01:53:33,246
"The cries of death is heard"

1326
01:53:33,288 --> 01:53:35,788
"Struggling for life...!"

1327
01:53:35,788 --> 01:53:38,454
"Will hit the person"

1328
01:53:38,454 --> 01:53:41,580
"The fear bursts, over night"

1329
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:44,121
"The cries of death is heard"

1330
01:53:44,121 --> 01:53:46,621
"Struggling for life...!"

1331
01:53:46,621 --> 01:53:49,246
"Will hit the person"

1332
01:53:49,288 --> 01:53:52,413
"The fear bursts, over night"

1333
01:53:52,413 --> 01:53:57,162
"And the whirl wind"

1334
01:53:57,162 --> 01:54:02,663
"The dream come true!"

1335
01:54:02,705 --> 01:54:14,413
"When spotting the blood,
Haven't recovered yet from forgetfulness"

1336
01:54:25,038 --> 01:54:29,162
"Has the night left out of hand?"

1337
01:54:30,246 --> 01:54:34,997
"The breeze at night
awaits to leave"

1338
01:54:34,997 --> 01:54:40,746
"The time the demon stays"

1339
01:54:40,746 --> 01:54:45,246
"Why this turbulence ?"
"The thought trembles on..."

1340
01:55:20,913 --> 01:55:24,413
"Bikki Likki Bikki Likki...Ki..Ki.."

1341
01:55:24,454 --> 01:55:28,121
"A lust of fire in the heart
as time moves on"

1342
01:55:28,121 --> 01:55:31,788
"Bikki Likki Bikki Likki...Ki..Ki.."

1343
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:36,538
"A lust of fire in the heart
as time moves on"

1344
01:55:43,538 --> 01:55:46,871
"Bikki Likki Bikki Likki...Ki..Ki.."

1345
01:55:46,871 --> 01:55:50,329
"A lust of fire in the heart
as time moves on"

1346
01:55:50,329 --> 01:55:51,746
"Get high"

1347
01:55:51,746 --> 01:55:54,538
"Don't search for me within you
 just to lose yourself"

1348
01:55:54,538 --> 01:55:55,371
"Get high"

1349
01:55:55,413 --> 01:55:58,121
"Don't take a dip in the sky
in search of me"

1350
01:55:58,121 --> 01:55:59,204
"Hangout"

1351
01:55:59,246 --> 01:56:01,997
"Don't tell me your desires in loops"

1352
01:56:05,997 --> 01:56:09,663
"You are on top of the sky,
what more are you searching beyond that?"

1353
01:56:09,663 --> 01:56:12,913
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

1354
01:56:12,913 --> 01:56:16,580
"You are on top of the sky,
 what more are you searching beyond that?"

1355
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:19,788
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

1356
01:56:52,621 --> 01:56:56,121
"Eyes are longing and,
Why dont you rock my world"

1357
01:56:56,121 --> 01:56:58,371
"Quench my thirst"

1358
01:56:59,788 --> 01:57:02,329
"You can tell your needs"

1359
01:57:02,496 --> 01:57:03,746
"You got all night"

1360
01:57:03,788 --> 01:57:06,538
"To satisfy the desires"

1361
01:57:07,788 --> 01:57:09,997
"This is Life"

1362
01:57:10,038 --> 01:57:12,162
"This is the answer"

1363
01:57:12,162 --> 01:57:14,871
"Get high..."

1364
01:57:14,871 --> 01:57:17,788
"Be Me..."

1365
01:57:17,788 --> 01:57:19,955
"Take my Hands..."

1366
01:57:19,955 --> 01:57:22,913
"Reach for the Sky"

1367
01:57:22,913 --> 01:57:26,538
"You are on top of the sky,
what more are you searching beyond that?"

1368
01:57:26,538 --> 01:57:28,746
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

1369
01:57:28,746 --> 01:57:30,538
"Why did you seek me?"

1370
01:57:30,538 --> 01:57:34,162
"You are on top of the sky,
what more are you searching beyond that?"

1371
01:57:34,162 --> 01:57:36,371
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

1372
01:57:37,871 --> 01:57:41,496

1376
01:57:49,121 --> 01:57:51,329
"Let's go leaving this body behind!"

1377
01:59:36,871 --> 01:59:40,246
"One fine evening!"

1378
01:59:40,246 --> 01:59:43,788
"It was Twilight"

1379
01:59:45,079 --> 01:59:49,079
"Desires spiked and masks tweaked"

1380
01:59:49,079 --> 01:59:53,454
"There she walked in to the trap,
like a bug."

1381
01:59:57,496 --> 02:00:06,079
"This world lacks the taste for art"

1382
