Are you fine?

Sridevi… She is having a gala time here.

536
00:30:49,527 --> 00:30:51,069
She might look so on the outside.

537
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,569
But she must be hurting inside.

00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:02,569
Are you smiling on the outside
and hurting on the inside?

'You're angry that I called you a beggar?'

'I wasn't cursing you.'

00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,580
I have to earn money right away.

Why are you furious about that?

- 50 lakhs.

50 lakhs?!

00:31:40,538 --> 00:31:42,871
A 10 here and there will do.
But I have to earn that money.

559

This guy is way beyond our level.

00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:46,871
Get the Samanthakamani for him.

562
00:31:50,205 --> 00:31:56,330
May you be rid of all
the evil eyes cast on you.

563
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:59,080
No one would cast an evil eye on it.
The car itself looks evil.

564
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:02,913
Why? Why do you say that to a brand new car?

565
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,455
Brand new? When it’s used for 10 years,
it’s not brand new.

00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:08,996
Sister, what's happening?

567
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:12,038
We bought a new car, Saroj. How is it?

568
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:15,288
Washing it doesn't make it new.
It's a second hand car, right?

569
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:18,496
Correct. Look. Even she
got to know it's second hand.

570

You shut up. You don’t even
have a second hand car.

You don’t get irritated. Come on.

572
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:26,955
Being second hand doesn't
make it any less of a car.

Listen.  Take a picture of me
and your mom with the car.

With this phone? This phone?

It shuts off even I say hello out loud.

You can't get your son a new phone
or send him abroad to study.

Hey! Trump is not a nice guy like your dad.

He is chasing fools back home.

Get him one of your gemstones.
He will be stricken with bad luck.

Your engineering could be completed
only after selling 60 such gems.

I need to start selling granite
stones to send you to America.

That isn’t my bike.

I didn’t mean the other bike.
I was talking about our bike.

I would come after such an insult?

1914
01:48:59,371 --> 01:49:03,913
From now on, all his drinks are on us.
Free!

1915
01:49:09,163 --> 01:49:11,788
He's paralyzed. Bed rest is much needed.

1916
01:49:11,871 --> 01:49:13,746
Don't pressurize him. Take care.

1917
01:49:13,788 --> 01:49:14,330
Hmm.

1918
01:49:18,746 --> 01:49:22,871
They stole everything we saved, sir.
You have to take care of everything now.

1919
01:49:25,996 --> 01:49:28,705
Sir, shall we file a complaint
about these 100 crores?

1920
01:49:28,955 --> 01:49:29,705
Let it be.

1921
01:49:31,527 --> 01:49:31,527
Think of it as mom's birthday gift.
