00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,920
'I don't want to study anymore.

16
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,280
You don't need to work,
just sit at home.

17
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,800
I am little bit foodie, you know.

18
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,520
I don't have any bad habits and
I never lie.

19
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,960
Excuse me,
you forgot your lighter sir.

20
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,400
Thank you.

21
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,280
My boy is very shy, that is why
I am here to meet you.

22
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
What are you doing Nikki

23
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,920
When will you get married
if you reject everyone.

24
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,200
Your dad...

25
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,520
Your dad wants you to get married
before you complete education.

26
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,440
Why are you increasing the volume
when I am speaking to you

27
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
Uncle

28
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Uncle please, let me watch

29
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,480
Just give me the remote
- No...

30
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,560
I'm not giving you .

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,720
No.

32
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,200
Choose one guy from those pictures
and I'll give you the remote

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Uncle, come here

34
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,400
Sit.

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,640
We shop hours for clothes
we dump in months.

36
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,320
This is about my life partner.

37
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,640
There's nothing wrong in being a
little cautious about my selection.

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,960
What kind of a guy
are you looking for?

39
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,880
I don't have too many hopes,
auntie.

40
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,320
He shouldn't lie

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,840
Should be honest

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,560
Love me more than
anything in the world...

43
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,200
Follow my words

44
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,760
And he should never
look at another girl

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,880
Your hopes are impossible...

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,560
You'll not find a guy like him
these days.

47
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
Why? Don't you
think I'm such a guy?

48
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,560
Really? Give me your phone once.

49
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,600
No way!

50
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,320
This is how guys are.

51
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,200
Those qualities were in Lord Rama
back in the epics

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,240
Yes! I need a man like Rama.

53
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,560
Hi, auntie and uncle

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,920
Nikki, Shall we move?
- She'll never find her man.

55
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,840
She'll never find her man.

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
How long?

57
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,400
We'll be there in 20
if there's no traffic

58
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,640
In case there is,
it'll take 2 hours.

59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,800
I hope there's no traffic!
I hope there's no traffic!

60
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,880
Oh shit! Shit!

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,240
I'm so sorry.
- I'm fine!

62
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,840
What happened?

63
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Must be a students' protest.

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,200
What's happening there?

65
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,640
Dean Down! Down!
Vicky is innocent.

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,040
Lucky guy

67
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
So many girls for one guy?

68
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,240
Dean Down! Down!

69
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,680
He must be expelled.

70
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,760
Madam, your daughter is protesting
against you.

71
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
I can see that.

72
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,600
Let's go.

73
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Dean Down! Down!
Vicky is innocent.

74
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,080
Vicky is innocent.

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,720
Dean Down! Down!
- Excuse me   What's going on?

76
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,960
Get lost!

77
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,760
Crazy girl.
- Hey Dean

78
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,000
Bitch!

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,000
If Vicky doesn't receive justice
I'll burn your car.

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,960
Excuse me
What exactly happened?

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,720
We're protesting against the Dean
in favour of Vicky.

82
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,160
Who the hell is Vicky?

83
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,080
My boyfriend...

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,480
He's my boyfriend.

85
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,000
Vicky might sound
just like a name to you

86
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,640
But to us college girls
Vicky is an emotion.

87
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
Hot! Cute!

88
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,960
In simple words, he looks
like the heir to a Greek God.

89
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,480
He's a chick magnet

90
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,640
He has many girlfriends.
All friends with benefits.

91
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
What's happened to him now?

92
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
Dean caught her daughter red handed
during combined studies with Vicky.

93
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,640
Dean expelled Vicky from college

94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,880
What did Vicky do then?

95
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,080
He appealed to the legal counsel
in our college

96
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,800
He has to prove his innocence
to the counsel.

97
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,200
Today is the day.

98
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,720
Vicky's meeting her.

99
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,120
Prashanti Reddy

100
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,960
Head counselor of the university

101
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,080
Age 32...

102
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,520
she's very strict.

103
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,400
She treats men very low

104
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,800
She staff is filled with men

105
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,920
She scolds them everyday
and satisfies her ego.

106
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,360
Please pray for Vicky

107
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,120
This guy has a crazy character
- No, he's a dangerous character.

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,240
Excuse me, Miss!

109
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,120
English is a funny language

110
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,680
The one we're not supposed to miss
is called as Miss.

111
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,000
Where's the Counselor's office?

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Thank you.

113
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,960
Hey! You speak Telugu?

114
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,160
Oh  Ego.

115
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,640
On April 6th, at 11:30 pm...

116
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,480
What were you doing in Dean's
daughter Margaret's bed room?

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,240
I just helped Margaret relieve
her stress levels.

118
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Stress?

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,000
Can you explain?

120
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,160
Yes, Miss Reddy.

121
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
Back when you were a student...

122
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,960
What would you do to relieve
stress during exams?

123
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,480
I'd eat a chocolate.

124
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,560
Huh! Chocolates would help
back in those days

125
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,560
But the stress levels
now are higher

126
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,920
Chocolates and biscuits
don't seem to work

127
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,720
We need a human touch.
- What?!

128
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,720
I had the same reaction.

129
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,560
But her stress levels were at peaks
as it was examination time.

130
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,000
She couldn't focus at all.

131
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,120
She has exam in the morning.

132
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,480
She has to study to clear it.

133
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,280
She needs her stress
relieved to study.

134
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,320
And to relieve stress, I have to...
- Huh!

135
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,280
I have to help her.

136
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,400
Moral values on one hand and

137
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,560
Margaret's career on the other.

138
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,680
Values or career?

139
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,520
Values or career?

140
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,520
Values or career?

141
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,200
Values or career?

142
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,840
Values or career?
- What did you decide?

143
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,360
To hell with the values!

144
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,760
I've decided to help
Margaret's career.

145
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,720
I stayed there until her
stress levels were normal...

146
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,120
I did everything she asked for...

147
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,800
I also let her take control...

148
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,280
She felt really happy.

149
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,000
But her mom barged
in at the same moment.

150
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,440
She didn't feel happy.

151
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,960
Miss Reddy

152
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,720
I'm not guilty. Please help me.

153
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,200
Miss Reddy.
Your hands are shivering

154
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,360
I can hear your heart beat aloud.

155
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,520
You're sweating.

156
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,800
I think you're stressed.

157
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,360
Do you want a chocolate?

158
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
No.

159
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,320
Miss Reddy?

160
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,040

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,480
"He doesn't leave behind any hints"

183
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,640
Vicky, My mom is not
really happy about us

184
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,200
I think we need to break up.

185
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,520
Okay.

186
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,960
So, since we are
breaking up anyway

187
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,800
Can we have fun one last time?

188
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,320
Okay.

189
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,640
"Mr. Majnu!"

190
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,160
"He's like intoxication"

191
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,760
"Mr. Majnu!"

192
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,360
"A rugged Greek Lord"

193
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,840
"Mr. Majnu!"

194
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,040
Uncle is not coming dad
due to some Visa issues...

195
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,680
Hey!

196
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,000
Sorry.

197
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,400
Sorry, I actually didn't see.

198
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,440
I'll call you later.

199
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,000
You speak Telugu?

200
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,400
Excuse me miss

201
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,040
English is a funny language

202
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,040
The one we're not supposed to miss
is called as Miss.

203
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,240
Hi

204
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,200
I'm Vicky

205
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,640
So what?

206
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
And please  Don't follow me.

207
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,200
Girls do whatever they like
and boys don't listen to anyone.

208
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,320
Please take your seat, ma'am.

209
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,840
I want to change my seat please.

210
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,640
Sorry the flight is full.

211
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,080
Is the flight occupied, Nikitha?

212
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Can I call you Nikki?
It sounds cute.

213
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,560
How do you know my name?

214
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,760
I managed to get a seat beside you.
Finding your name is no big deal.

215
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,240
Look Vicky

216
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,240
No matter how hard you try,
I'll not fall for you.

217
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,280
Because, I've got
the whole picture of you.

218
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,720
What do you know about me?

219
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,240
Your name is Vikram Krishna

220
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,880
You pursued MS finance
at Wellington University

221
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,240
It took you 4 years to clear
the 2 years course...

222
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,280
There's not a single subject
you haven't failed.

223
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,320
And you went on a date with

224
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,480
each and every
girl in your college.

225
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,640
Okay, thanks.

226
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,360
Thanks? For what?

227
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,640
Look

228
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,640
If you had told me this after
we landed in Hyderabad..

229
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,680
I would've wasted the entire
flight hitting on you.

230
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,920
I can happily hit
on another girl now.

231
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,920
What's the guarantee
you'll find another girl?

232
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,680
Where's 12D?

233
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,400
12D

234
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
12D

235
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
There.

236
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,760
There.

237
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,040
Thanks.

238
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,240
Excuse me miss

239
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Yes?

240
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,640
Damn!

241
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,400
You're so funny...

242
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,400
Stop it...

243
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,960
That's correct.
- Yes.

244
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,160
He is here.

245
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,680
Vicky!

246
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,640
Hi, dad

247
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,080
How are you, uncle?

248
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,240
A lot better now, son.

249
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,240
Hi, I'm Kishore.

250
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,400
Sorry

251
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,640
He's Kishore. Your uncle's
future son-in-law...

252
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,960
Bro!

253
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,160
How come you're here to receive me?

254
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,400
Actually, my sister landed from
the same flight.

255
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,560
Same flight?

256
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,200
There she is.

257
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,480
Hi.

258
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,960
Hi, brother

259
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,320
How are you?
- I'm good.

260
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,880
How are you?
- Hi uncle.

261
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm good.

262
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,400
Dad, you know her?

263
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,400
She took care of Uma's engagement.

264
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,840
He's my son, Vicky.

265
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,440
Hi.

266
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,720
Hi.

267
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,200
He was in the same flight.
You didn't see him?

268
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,440
Thanks a lot Vicky
It was great.

269
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,200
I saw him.

270
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,400
She asked for a pen in the flight,
So I gave to her. She's thanking me now.

271
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,400
Is that true?

272
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,080
Promise, dad. That's true.

273
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,560
Vicky!

274
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,560
Hey, did you lie?

275
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,400
He's Chitti  My best friend.

276
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,880
Did you lie or not?

277
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
How do you know that he lied?

278
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,960
It's nature's connection.

279
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,160
I injure myself every time he lies.
- Traffic Jam, Bye.

280
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,480
Traffic Jam

281
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,160
Fine, I'll meet you later

282
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,080
Bye.

283
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,520
Let's go.

284
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,560
Get the car.
- Okay sir.

285
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,480
Did you say something
to Kishore's sister?

286
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,720
Why is she angry on you?
- I didn't say anything dad

287
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,640
Really?

288
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,320
Promise dad,
I didn't say anything to her.

289
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,640
Vicky!
- Be cautious.

290
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,360
We are from the Girl's side.

291
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,440
Vicky!

292
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,920
Vicky!

293
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,320
Good morning, love!

294
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,520
Hi, auntie...

295
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,680
Have some coffee and sleep.

296
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,000
Thank you.
- Hi bro

297
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,480
What did you get for me?

298
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,320
Look aunty,
she has become very commercial

299
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,240
Yes.

300
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,160
Go! The whole black
suitcase is for you.

301
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,080
Wow!
- Enjoy.

302
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,240
Thank you.

303
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,080
Aunty, don't keep any
hopes on her or Vinodh

304
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,480
I'll be taking care of you later

305
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,360
I forgot
- Did uncle wake up?

306
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,960
No. He told me to inform him
once you are awake.

307
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,240
Make it fast, guys.
Wedding is in less than 20 days.

308
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,360
You guys are way behind.
Make it fast. Come on!

309
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,800
Good morning, uncle.

310
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,320
It's 12' o clock.

311
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,680
I was home late last night, so

312
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,840
Got your masters degree at least?

313
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,760
Here's my certificate, uncle.

314
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,800
Whoa!

315
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,280
You're behind by 2 years

316
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
Don't you feel embarrassed?

317
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,840
Learn from your younger brother.

318
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,560
You're talking about Vinodh?
- Yes

319
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,920
He pursued engineering in IIT.
MBA in IIM..

320
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,040
He's an investment banker and
earns 5 lakhs per month

321
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,440
and you're still at zero.

322
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,160
Your father topped
in civil engineering

323
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,800
and I, in medical entrance.

324
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,600
I developed an interest in
construction later.

325
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,720
But I never neglected studies.
Never! Never!

326
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,640
Your brother is lecturing Vicky

327
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,680
Did he start?

328
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,040
You're the only one ridiculing
studies in our entire family.

329
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,960
Look there sir.

330
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,040
I keep telling you the same thing

331
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,720
Vicky!
- So, what I was telling that...

332
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,560
Uncle...

333
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,320
Dad

334
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
You know Kishore's sister right?
- Yeah. Nikki...

335
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,120
We have to gift her presents
as a ritual.

336
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,360
So, why don't you
take her shopping?

337
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,760
Don't hesitate about the price.

338
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,280
Why do we have to take that pain

339
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,120
We could pay them in cash.

340
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,760
Stop giving him suggestions and
listen to your father.

341
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,920
Bye, dad.
- Vinodh would have taken care

342
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,120
Very bad behaviour.

343
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,400
What?

344
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,760
What? Do I have to
go shopping with Vicky?

345
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Nikki.

346
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,640
Don't shout on your dad
I'll break your teeth.

347
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,040
Don't interfere. Go inside.

348
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Okay.

349
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,600
I'll go shopping with anyone...

350
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,480
Except him.

351
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,520
Who are you?

352
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,840
Idiot! Sorry... I'm Vicky.

353
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,400
Mr. Krishna Prasad's son...

354
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,720
Dear

355
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,880
Tell your daughter

356
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,680
If he heard her scolding him

357
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,320
It would be very bad.

358
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,520
He's Vicky  Krishna Prasad's son.

359
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,880
He's here.

360
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,600
Coffee
- I don't drink coffee.

361
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,840
Thank you.

362
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,400
Coffee.
- Did you prepare?

363
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,440
Get some biscuits.
- Right now.

364
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,440
You had it already?
- Yes, I couldn't wait.

365
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,480
Even this plant is dead.

366
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,280
Dad, I'm ready.

367
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,560
Nikki

368
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,600
What?

369
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,080
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
behaved like that with you.

370
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,400
Now that we are family,
can we be normal?

371
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
I'll stay in my limits.

372
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,160
No flirting or cheap jokes...

373
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,800
I'll do whatever you want me to.

374
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,840
I should be home by 6 sharp.
- Done.

375
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,240
Uma
- Hi Nikki

376
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,640
Why didn't you come inside?

377
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,440
Mom told me I can't come in
before marriage.

378
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,440
Brother

379
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,360
What are you doing here?
- Hi bro

380
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,640
Bro, manage mom
if she asks about me

381
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,840
Let's go.
- Okay, bye.

382
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
Hello  Excuse me

383
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,040
Excuse me
- Are you done? Shall we start?

384
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm not done yet
They are ignoring me.

385
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,960
Really?

386
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,360
Excuse me, miss

387
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,160
Sir.

388
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,160
Thank you.

389
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,520
Madam.

390
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,840
Sir, who is she?

391
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,280
Relatives.

392
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,880
How do you flirt
so easily with them?

393
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Simple.

394
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,600
Sweet lies.

395
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,520
I praise them
They fall for it.

396
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,200
All the girls are not the same

397
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,560
Girls have very high expectations
from girls

398
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,920
They only fall in love when
those standards are reached.

399
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,800
Then I'll have to tell you
the Doberman theory.

400
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,760
In a girl's imagination, the boys
are like He-Man.

401
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
But they fall in
love with Doberman .

402
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,240
Ever noticed?

403
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,520
A beautiful girl falls
in love with a rough guy.

404
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,160
And a studious girl will always
falls for a back bencher.

405
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,440
Yeah.

406
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,760
But why?

407
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,520
For the sake of power.

408
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,920
Only when guys are
inferior to you...

409
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,120
You can make them feel
they don't deserve you.

410
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,960
You remind them every minute
that they're just your puppets.

411
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,600
A He-Man will
ask you to get lost.

412
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,080
But a Doberman is different.
Very loyal.

413
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,040
He acts demure as he
fears you'll dump him.

414
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,160
Here.

415
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,880
What are you thinking about?

416
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,080
So I'm hoping to find
a man like Lord Rama.

417
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,640
Will I ever find such a man?
Tell me!

418
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,200
Will I find him or not?

419
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,920
You might find him.
How can we be so sure?

420
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,160
Why'd you give me this
bloody Doberman theory then?

421
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,360
I'm beginning to worry about
the kind of man I'll find.

422
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,600
What happened?
- Leave me alone.

423
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,360
Nikki, can I say something?
- Hmmm.

424
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,200
This morning, you didn't
want to come with me.

425
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,360
But you did.

426
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,680
There was no dinner plan
but you had dinner.

427
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,800
You had to be home by 6 pm.

428
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,520
It's 10 pm and we're
still hanging out.

429
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,000
Did anything go wrong?
No, right?

430
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,160
That's how life is, Nikki.
Nothing goes as planned.

431
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,800
You'll meet your Rama
if you're destined.

432
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,080
But if you're fated to meet a better
guy, Rama is out of the picture.

433
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,160
So, don't ask God
for what you want.

434
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,720
Ask him for what's right for you.

435
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,680
Nikki
- Hi aunty.

436
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,200
Uma  Nikki is here..
- - How are you?

437
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,320
I'm good.

438
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
Hey  Small gift for you.
- Thank you.

439
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,280
Where's uncle?

440
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,200
Vinod is coming today.
He went to pick him up.

441
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,120
What? Vinod is coming today?

442
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,640
Yeah. You didn't know?
- Why would I stay home if I did?

443
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,120
I'm so dead

444
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,440
I'll bring the luggage
Go inside dad.

445
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,960
I'm dead. Dead!

446
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,160
Vinod's here.
Lakshmi he is here.

447
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,000
Hey, Nikki  When did you come here?
- Just now.

448
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,600
This is my son Vinod. From Mumbai

449
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,160
Hi.
- Hi.

450
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,360
Mom, how are you?
- I'm good, dear.

451
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,560
Freshen up. I'll serve lunch.

452
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,160
Hey Vicky

453
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,880
Vinodh is coming

454
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,640
Vicky...
Didn't you lose this guy yet?

455
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,120
He's my best friend, man.

456
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,480
By the way,
I heard you finished MS

457
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,280
Ya.
- So what's next?

458
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,360
I'll start going to office
after the wedding.

459
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,080
Yes  You will go

460
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,760
It's your dad's office. Dad-gifted
car and dad-given money.

461
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,480
Let me know when you do something
on your own.

462
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,120
I can't take this shit, man.

463
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,520
Uncle, car is in the sun,
I'll keep it under shade.

464
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,520
At his age someone created Facebook
- Mark Zuckerberg.

465
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,600
Very recently he bought WhatsApp.

466
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,880
But this guy is still checking
his WhatsApp messages

467
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,120
Vicky

468
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,400
You've got a lot of work outside.
What's with all the crap?

469
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
You go.

470
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,160
To hell with her.

471
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,920
Are your brains feeling the heat?

472
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,720
I'm use to this since childhood.

473
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,320
You would be doing great
if you studied well.

474
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,480
Let's put studies topic away.

475
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,000
You should be having
some goal in life.

476
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,280
Who says I don't have a goal?

477
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,080
What is it?
- I have to develop dad's company.

478
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,160
What was that?

479
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,840
Where's your identity in walking
in your dad's footsteps?

480
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,520
That's what your uncle's
been telling you.

481
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,200
Nikki, my dad taught me to walk

482
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,400
Is it wrong to walk
in his footsteps?

483
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,120
Do I have to dream big?

484
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,360
Isn't it enough to take
his dreams forward?

485
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,360
I'm not there without my father.
That's true.

486
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,840
He's my strength.

487
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,800
But I'll be my dad's
strength someday.

488
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
That's more satisfying for me.

489
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,400
I don't have to invent Facebook
or buy WhatsApp.

490
00:27:44,000 --> 00:28:04,000

491
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,200
Nikki

492
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,680
Your brother smokes and I hate it.

493
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,000
Except for that,

494
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,680
Kishore is a sweetheart.

495
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,800
He's a ladies man for sure.

496
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,720
You might not like that.

497
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,760
But, he is a gentleman.

498
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,920
You will understand slowly

499
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,240
Let's go.

500
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,360
You guys carry on
Vicky will drop me.

501
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,400
Okay thanks.
- Okay.

502
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
Hi Vicky

503
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,840
Hey  How are you?

504
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,480
I'm good  Meet my Would-be Vamsi.

505
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,840
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

506
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,200
When are you getting married?
- September.

507
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,200
Shall we go?

508
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
Where's Uma?
- She went with my brother.

509
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,840
Vicky

510
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,800
Who is she?

511
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,200
She's my relative.

512
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,360
Who is she?
- My Ex girlfriend.

513
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,360
What?

514
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,080
Vicky

515
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,480
Are you friendly with
all of your exes?

516
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Yeah.

517
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,240
Even if they have a boyfriend now?

518
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,600
Some of them are also married.

519
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,640
Aren't you jealous of them?

520
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,960
Not all girls in the world
are born for me, Nikki.

521
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,360
They have a life of their own.
And I respect that.

522
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,240
But  not everyone
is like you, Vicky.

523
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,120
Sushma was very jealous
to see us together.

524
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,120
What?
- Yeah.

525
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,240
She thinks I am your girlfriend.

526
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,400
I could see it on her face.

527
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,040
If someone cries for
me, it's not my fault.

528
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,040
But if I'm the reason
someone cries...

529
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,080
It's definitely my fault.

530
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,600
And I'll never make that mistake.

531
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,600
God, Vicky!

532
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,880
You're making me jealous.

533
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,360
You're the happiest
person I've ever met.

534
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,120
Have you ever been
sad in your life?

535
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,360
No.

536
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,640
Seriously? You never cried?

537
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,960
No.

538
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
When you hurt yourself as a kid
or broke one of your toys.

539
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,280
I'd apply ointment
if I hurt myself.

540
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,920
Buy a new toy in case I broke one.

541
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,600
Not even when your mother died?

542
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
Sorry.

543
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,560
I was 3 hours old
when my mom passed away.

544
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,680
Everyone must have
cried when she died.

545
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,040
I must have too. I don't know.

546
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,360
Don't you miss your mom?

547
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,000
My dad never let me feel so.

548
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,280
Chitti! Come.
- Coming.

549
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Hi aunty

550
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
Hi Nikki
- Where's Uma aunty?

551
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,680
She went to give
invitations to her friends.

552
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,280
She'll be back in 15 minutes

553
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,520
Sit in her room.

554
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,720
Okay, aunty.
- Okay.

555
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,080
What's your problem?
- Hey stop it!

556
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,120
Why are you beating him?
- I've been packing them since morning.

557
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,360
I asked for help and he called
me jobless, acting all sarcastic.

558
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,600
How dare you hit me!

559
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,880
I'll tell Dad.
- Get lost.

560
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,760
Your uncle will be serious on you.
- That's fine.

561
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,680
Dad  Dad

562
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,960
Hey, Shiva Prasad!

563
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,920
Where are you?

564
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,320
Shiva Prasad!

565
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Where is Shiva Prasad?

566
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,280
Shiva Prasad!
- Sir.

567
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
Mr Reddy  What happened?

568
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,840
Are you planning to
ever pay me back?

569
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,960
Sir, please

570
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,120
Sir, listen to me.

571
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,960
Guests are home, sir.
- Didn't you know while borrowing money?

572
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,840
Didn't you know that, huh?

573
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
You have to return the money.
- I can't return as of now.

574
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,840
It's kind of hard.

575
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,080
Didn't you know while
borrowing money?

576
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Let's sit and talk.

577
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,680
I didn't come here
to sit and talk.

578
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,960
Answer me!
- Take your hands off him.

579
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,800
Do you know who you're talking to?

580
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,800
Let's sit and talk.

581
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,120
Your brother's taken a loan
of 25 crores with interest.

582
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,600
He hasn't paid me in 6 months.

583
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,120
He stopped coming to
office since 3 months.

584
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,600
He doesn't respond to my calls.
What do I do?

585
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,880
It's true that I
borrowed money from him.

586
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
I constructed a layout in Timmapur.

587
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,320
As the market is in crisis...

588
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,600
Project sales are down.

589
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,800
I couldn't pay him back in time.

590
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,480
Fine.

591
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
There's a wedding in our family.

592
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,440
He can't pay you now.

593
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,480
I know this is the right
time to demand my money.

594
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,680
I'm not leaving without my money.

595
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,520
Sir.

596
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,520
Give me 3 months time.

597
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,080
I'll give you the money.

598
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,440
Not possible!

599
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,200
Sir

600
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,880
It's my daughter's wedding.
I'll lose my respect.

601
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,880
Hey. I don't trust you

602
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,680
I'll sign wherever you want me to.

603
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,160
What are you talking?

604
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,240
It's okay.

605
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,520
It's okay.

606
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,200
I'll take care of it.

607
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,640
Hey! Bring the papers.
- Boss.

608
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,680
Okay, boss.

609
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,600
Hey, they're empty sheets.

610
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,760
It's okay, brother.

611
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,360
Ask your son to sign as well.

612
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,960
Why do you need his signature?

613
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,800
What if you put IP?

614
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,240
What if you die?

615
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,200
Who'll pay me?
Tell him to sign.

616
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,280
Son

617
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,640
Sign.

618
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,920
I can't, dad.

619
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,400
It's okay.

620
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,840
I'll take care of everything.
Nothing will happen.

621
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,560
What if you can't
take care of everything?

622
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,800
This is too much pressure for me.

623
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,200
I don't know what tomorrow holds .

624
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,200
So, don't drag me into this.

625
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,400
And it's not fair of you
to make me pay for your mistakes.

626
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,080
Vinod.

627
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,760
Sorry uncle.

628
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,600
Not even your son trusts you.
How can I?

629
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,560
Don't drag kids into this.

630
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,640
Are you fine with me signing it?

631
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,800
Mr. Krishna Prasad's assurance is
more than I can ask for.

632
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,960
Is your son going to sign?

633
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,240
I wish Shiva Prasad shouldn't
pay the money.

634
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
I can loot this house through
some litigation.

635
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,200
Make it quick!

636
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,440
Hey

637
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,720
Open the gate.

638
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,960
I can't do it.
He has the keys.

639
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,000
You guys are so full of it.
Can't you work properly? Come on!

640
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,920
Go bring the keys.

641
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,640
He looks very angry, sir.
He might hit you.

642
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,920
Hey  Go bring the keys.
- Okay, boss.

643
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,720
Hey! Where's the DJ?
Ask him to come quick.

644
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,240
Why is he so late? Call him!
- Okay sir.

645
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,400
Hey.

646
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Visit @CC_Tvseries Telegram Channel For Your Favorite TV Shows.

647
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,360
I already told you

648
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,040
That he is angry
and he might hit you.

649
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,440
You shouldn't have messed with him.

650
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,480
What are you looking at?
Finish your work.

651
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,560
Hey.

652
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,600
Bring the keys.
- Okay.

653
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,840
Put him down and bring the keys.

654
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,080
Hey, useless fellows!
You stepped on the plants.

655
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,480
Uncle, how long do we
need to replace these?

656
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,440
We need quite a few hours, sir.

657
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,400
Couldn't you watch out? Huh?

658
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,680
You ruined all the plants.
- Leave me!!

659
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,800
You should be careful, right?

660
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,480
'I'm not leaving
without the money.'

661
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,440
Hey, don't hit me!

662
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,760
I'm a big rowdy back in Kadapa.

663
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,120
Let's sit and talk. Wait.

664
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,360
Don't hit me. Wait.

665
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,760
Wait!

666
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,760
Let's talk. Wait!

667
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,120
Please!

668
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,320
Ma'am...

669
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,320
Shiva hasn't eaten
anything since morning.

670
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,440
Get him some fruits.

671
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,560
We just made an agreement.
Why are you hitting me?

672
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,360
What will you go
tell people about this?

673
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,960
You'll say went to
Shiva Prasad's house...

674
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,480
Demanded your money...

675
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,640
And scared the hell out of him.

676
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,160
What will you tell them now?

677
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,600
You threatened Mr. Shiva
Prasad for money...

678
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,520
And his elder son
beat the hell out of you.

679
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,160
Tell them that, okay?

680
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,480
Yeah.

681
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,160
Let's go.
- Let's get out here quietly.

682
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,960
Are you out of your mind?

683
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,720
You can't mess with those goons

684
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,280
when the wedding is near?

685
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,880
My dad should be blamed for this.
Not you.

686
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,240
Has he ever been stable throughout
his life?

687
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,800
He failed as a doctor at first.

688
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,360
And now as a businessman.

689
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,360
That bloody old man!

690
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,720
Hey! How dare you hit me?
Let me tell dad about this.

691
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,520
Back when you were
in 9th grade I guess..

692
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,920
You had viral fever.

693
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,520
You remember?

694
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,000
No medicines worked on you.

695
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,720
Best doctors in
the city treated you.

696
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,680
They have lost hope.

697
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,760
Except for one doctor...

698
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,800
Doctor Shiva Prasad Rao.

699
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,480
My uncle...!

700
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,080
He used all his knowledge on you.

701
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,840
He spent all day and
night taking care of you.

702
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,920
He'd spend sleepless nights.

703
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,160
You finally recovered.

704
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,120
Doctors called
it a medical miracle.

705
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,240
Rest said God saved you.

706
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,320
And you called that God
a bloody old man today.

707
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,160
Uncle never held a stethoscope
again after that.

708
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,600
He promised God that day.

709
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,960
if you lived

710
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,640
He'd quit his loving profession.

711
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
He left it.

712
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,200
For you.

713
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,080
You couldn't sign a goddamn paper
when your dad was in trouble.

714
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,440
He held your hand and
taught you to walk.

715
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,600
But you let go of his hand today.

717
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,200
Sister can't know about this.

718
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,400
I won't tell her.

719
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,760
Thanks.

720
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,240
What are you doing here?

721
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,080
The guests are here

722
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,760
They are asking for you.

723
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,160
I thought he was my world.

724
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,360
But today...

725
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,800
All of a sudden...

726
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,080
He pushed me into void.

727
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,440
Don't say that, dear.

728
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,640
I'm not angry with him.

729
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,040
I'm just sad that I lost his trust.

730
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,400
I don't wish to live.
- Stop it, dear.

731
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,800
"An evening filled with smiles "

732
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,800
"Isn't it a celebration?"

733
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,040
"Mischief behind
the poking glances"

734
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,440
"It's elation"

735
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:39,560
"Moments of harmony
bring joy to the heart"

736
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,040
"Love can never be replaced"

737
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,320
"Let go of hatred forever"

738
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,120
"Distance between
the stars fades away"

739
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,480
"The sky of affection
brings them closer"

740
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,920
"An evening filled with smiles "

741
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,640
"Isn't it a celebration?"

742
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,880
"Unable to hide parental love"

743
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,000
"A heart has concealed its words"

744
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,880
"Unable to express feelings"

745
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,880
"There's no point in staying mum"

746
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,480
"You have the boon of
letting yesterday go"

747
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,080
"A step towards future
leads you to this day"

748
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,680
"As family comes
together to share love"

749
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,440
"Distance between
the stars fades away"

750
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,000
"The sky of affection
brings them closer"

751
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,200
I'm sorry dad.

752
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,440
"This guy casts a spell
with his precious self"

753
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,960
"He steals hearts with his charm"

754
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,200
"His mischief keeps you giggling"

755
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,800
"He brings a smile
on everyone's face"

756
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:38,640
"No riches match up to
these happy moments"

757
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,160
"Distance between
the stars fades away"

758
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,760
"The sky of affection
brings them closer"

759
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,600
Hey, I'm in love with a girl...

760
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,400
I brought her here
to introduce you.

761
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,480
Where is she?

762
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,440
Suha

763
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,840
One second.

764
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,760
Vicky!
- You guys know each other?

765
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,080
You guys already know each other?

766
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,320
He's already been with her.

767
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,320
Chitti

768
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,280
Chitti
- Chitti is angry.

769
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,840
You'll have ice cream?

770
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,320
Vicky is always like this, Chitti.
He goes over the top sometimes.

771
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,920
Is it?

772
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,320
Please don't say that about him.
He's my friend.

773
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,840
I mean to say...

774
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,560
It's not his fault.

775
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,280
My fate just screwed me.
It's a coincidence.

776
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,080
Vicky is really lucky to have
a friend like you.

777
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,160
Not at all. I'm lucky to have
a friend like him.

778
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,920
Do you know driver Ranga?

779
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,400
Hello... Show some respect.
Your friend calls him uncle.

780
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,800
He's my dad.

781
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,280
Your dad?!

782
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,160
My dad has been his dad's driver
since 20 years

783
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,480
I know Vicky since we were kids.

784
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,080
We're best friends.

785
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,880
Just like he introduced me to his dad
as his best friend when we were kids...

786
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,680
He still introduces me to his new
circle as Chitti, his best friend.

787
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,280
That's how he is, Nikki.

788
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,520
When he considers someone special
He dedicates his life to them.

789
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,280
Why is he different
when it comes to girls?

790
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,040
That's not his fault, Nikki.

791
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,800
Every girl that comes to him
wants him as her boyfriend.

792
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,560
None of them want
him to be the only one.

793
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,640
But the day a girl wants him
and him only...

794
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,680
Mark my words.

795
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,080
He'll fight for her.
Stand for her.

796
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,560
He'll carry her around
like a princess.

797
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,960
Mark my words.

798
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,160
Here comes my friend.

799
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,960
I asked for ice cream and you
bought me the whole thing.

800
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,920
Take this ice cream.

801
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,080
Hi Nikki

802
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,000
Hi  What's your plan for evening

803
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,400
Nothing  My friend is opening
a new club I'm going there.

804
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Can I join you?

805
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,080
You want to go to a club?

806
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,080
Please.

807
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,080
Vicky, I have to tell you something.
- One second.

808
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,520
Where are my friends?

809
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,560
Hi Vicky!

810
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,160
Come.

811
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,320
Vicky.

812
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,800
What's up guys?
- Hi.

813
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,680
How are you?
- Fine.

814
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,120
Hi.
- Hi.

815
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,640
Hi, how are you?
- I'm good.

816
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,640
Hi Vicky
- Hi.

817
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,560
How are you?
- I'm good.

818
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,480
Guys this is Nikki

819
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,960
Anil, Kavitha, Rohit and Sanjana

820
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,400
Hi Vicky
- Hey!

821
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,880
She is my relative

822
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,840
So Nikki

823
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,320
I'm stealing your relative
for some time. Don't mind.

824
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,040
Take care of her.

825
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,040
No. I tried calling you.

826
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,560
Hey.

827
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,800
Hey.

828
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,640
Vicky are you proposing?

829
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,040
Hey, guys... My friend is
proposing that girl. Cheer him up.

830
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,520
Vicky  Vicky

831
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,880
Vicky  Vicky

832
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,840
Vicky  Vicky

833
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,640
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

834
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,480
Small misunderstanding
I'm not proposing her.

835
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,800
She's my relative and
nothing more than that.

836
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,320
Okay, right?

837
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,680
Why are you angry with me
when it's the DJ's fault?

838
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,520
Why'd you say we
have nothing going on?

839
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,080
Because, that's the truth.

840
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,400
What do I have to
do to make you love me?

841
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,920
Tell me.

842
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,560
What do I have to
do to make you love me?

843
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,040
Do I have to laugh
at your lame jokes?

844
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,000
Do I have to deck myself
with make up?

845
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,160
Or do I have to dress in skirts
and walk the ramp?

846
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,240
Tell me

847
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,840
Tell me! What should I do?

848
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,720
Nikki! What's your problem?

849
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,400
I love you Vicky.

850
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,920
That's my problem.

851
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,400
And you don't get that.

852
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,680
That's the bigger problem.

853
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,640
Nikki

854
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,360
Nikki are you crying?

855
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,800
Nikki are you crying?

856
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,880
Nikki

857
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,320
She's crying.

858
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,960
Nikki  Don't cry please.

859
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,320
Can I touch you?

860
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,040
I really love you Vicky.

861
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,160
Okay.

862
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,800
Do you love me Vicky?

863
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,680
By love you mean...

864
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,360
A couple falls in love,

865
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,880
goes deep into that relation...

866
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,640
And finally gets married.
You mean that?

867
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,680
Yeah.

868
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,760
One minute.

869
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,160
I don't know how to
love like that, Nikki.

870
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,360
The longest I've been with a woman
is a month.

871
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,160
Shall we try for 2 months then?
- What?

872
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,440
I will stay in India
for the next 2 months.

873
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,720
Let's work out a relationship
in these 2 months.

874
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,600
It'll be a huge mess if our
families know about this, Nikki.

875
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,440
Let's try.

876
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,720
We'll tell them once
we reach a decision.

877
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,000
Or else, we can forget about it.

878
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,200
Please Vicky  Do this for me.

879
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,680
Let's try.

880
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,120
Okay.

881
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,360
Okay.

882
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,840
So are we lovers now?

883
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,120
Yes.

884
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,880
So I can kiss you.

885
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,440
Shit. Sorry  Sorry

886
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,880
I'm sorry  Sorry.

887
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,960
Vicky, all your relations
must have started with a kiss.

888
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,480
But I don't want
ours to be that way.

889
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,240
Let's take it slow.

890
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,480
Okay?

891
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,960
Are you okay?
Shall we go?

892
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,360
You can put your hand on me.

893
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,400
Vicky

894
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,120
Vicky  Good morning.

895
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,680
Why are you not picking my calls?

896
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,680
Oh! Your phone is in silent mode.

897
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,560
Your room should be clean.
- Hey, wait!

898
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,240
What's with all these books? Cheap!

899
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,160
Hey

900
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,680
You came home directly.

901
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,880
Why? I can't come here?

902
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,320
You came directly to my room.

903
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,360
I can't come?

904
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,480
What if someone saw you?
- Oh

905
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,720
Sorry, you want me to leave?
- Yes.

906
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,440
I woke up early in
the morning for you

907
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,400
I came to your house.

908
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,480
I also came to your room
without anyone noticing.

909
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,480
Now you want me to leave?

910
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,920
This is not the way you love.

911
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,840
Aunty

912
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,080
Aunty one second please be outside.

913
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,880
Hi aunty

914
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,400
Uma asked for these books

915
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,480
Bye aunty.
- Bye.

916
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,360
What are you looking at?

917
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,640
Nothing.

918
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,360
I'll be screwed if
someone sees me with you.

919
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,520
Do you find it an insult
to come out with me?

920
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,920
Huh?!
- Leave, Vicky.

921
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,120
Actually, I'll leave.
- No. No. No.

922
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,920
Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean it.
- What is this, Vicky?

923
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,400
I don't understand.
Why are you here then?

924
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,000
If you want to go, you can.
- No. No. No.

925
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,080
You forgot the fact that
we're together here for lunch.

926
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,920
It's nothing, man. Just friends.

927
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,160
Happy Anniversary!

928
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,800
We've been in love for a week now.

929
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,400
Oh...
- Hmm.

930
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,600
Feed me.

931
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,520
"Hey! Is this really me?"

932
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,400
"I can't believe I'm with you"

933
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,200
"Hey! Look at me"

934
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,800
"This is just magical"

935
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:37,200
"I've never been this excited"

936
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,440
"My heart is jumping around in joy"

937
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,840
"Maybe this is destiny"

938
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,720
"I feel lucky to have met you"

939
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,600
"As your warm glances
poke my heart"

940
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,360
"I feel chuckled
when you act naughty"

941
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,280
"Hey! Is this really me?"

942
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,280
"I can't believe I'm with you"

943
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,880
"Hey! Look at me"

944
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,080
"This is just magical"

945
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,720
"I love you always and forever"

946
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,440
"I sing these songs of affection"

947
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,360
"I know all your favorites"

948
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,200
"I change myself to impress you"

949
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,040
"No matter who's holding me back

950
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,880
"I'm running ahead to reach you"

951
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,680
"No matter how much I resist"

952
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,360
"I can't stay away from you"

953
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,000
"Even if you act ignorant"

954
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,800
"Even if you make me desperate"

955
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,480
"As your warm glances
poke my heart"

956
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,400
"I lose myself in your imagination"

957
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,920
How long do we have to wait?

958
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,800
Let's go.
- Nikki, where to?

959
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,640
Buy me this watch.

960
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,880
Why don't you go buy
it yourself, Nikki?

961
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,960
Did you have to bring us along?

962
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,880
It's not like I can't buy it...

963
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,880
I want my boyfriend
to buy it for me.

964
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:27,480
"I can't capture all
our moments at once"

965
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:33,120
"I can't express all
my feelings to you"

966
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,000
"For every minute in an hour"

967
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,680
"Shall I present you my dreams?"

968
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,720
"Before time slips out of my hands"

969
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,120
"Shall I confess my hopes to you?"

970
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,920
"No matter all the time we spend"

971
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,600
"I'm just asking you for a second"

972
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,320
"As your warm glances
poke my heart"

973
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,560
"I lose myself in your imagination"

974
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,440
Why'd you call me urgently?
- Come.

975
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,200
What if someone saw us?
- Nobody's home.

976
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,840
Come...
- Are you sure?

977
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,720
So, this is my world.

978
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,040
How do you like it?

979
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,360
Cool.

980
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,480
Happy anniversary!

981
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,480
Cake is all you've got for me?

982
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,400
Why do you think
dirty all the time?

983
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,480
I will kiss you.

984
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,320
Not when you ask for it.
But when I feel like it.

985
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,880
Hmm. Okay.

986
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,560
This is my favourite doll.
Cinderella.

987
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,440
Keep it.

988
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,960
Why are you giving it to me?

989
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,840
My favourite doll should
be with the person I love.

990
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,800
At least when you look at the
doll, you should think of me.

991
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,840
Don't look at me like that.

992
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,600
Off late, you haven't been
spending time with me, Vicky.

993
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,880
We've been meeting
every day, right?

994
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,440
That's not enough for me.

995
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,960
I want to spend more time with you.

996
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,800
You should always keep this.

997
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,640
Sunny Leone! Mia Khalifa!

998
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,480
Wow! Quite a collection
you've got here.

999
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,440
Internet will be ashamed.

1000
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,640
Hey! What are you doing?

1001
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,680
You're a lover boy now,
playing with cute dolls.

1002
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,040
I'm shifting these
hot dolls to my room.

1003
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,240
Stop it!

1004
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,440
What's wrong?

1005
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,800
I'm planning my whole
week around this.

1006
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:33,960
Hey, I said stop it!

1007
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,440
Have you got the new one?

1008
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,840
I said stop it!

1009
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,760
We're in trouble, man.
- What have I done?

1010
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,800
It fell on the floor by itself.
- Uh-huh?

1011
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,760
Are you saying it
committed suicide?

1012
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,760
Even Supreme Court Judge
won't believe you. Forget Nikki.

1013
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,440
Vicky!

1014
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,640
I didn't do it, Nikki. It was him.

1015
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,400
I didn't do it. Get lost!

1016
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,800
Nikki, it was accidental.

1017
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,320
Why would I do it on purpose?
I'm sorry.

1018
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,160
Am I bothering you?

1019
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,240
You mean?

1020
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,320
Am I forcing things on to you?

1021
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,400
Because I broke the doll?

1022
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,240
It's not just about
the doll, Vicky.

1023
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,440
Everything.

1024
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,040
You don't appreciate
anything I do for you.

1025
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,400
You don't even throw
me a compliment.

1026
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,560
Forget all that.

1027
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,600
Have you ever taken
me out on a date?

1028
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,720
I'll only call you from tomorrow.

1029
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,320
And I'll compliment you every day.

1030
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,960
Let's go on a date tomorrow itself.

1031
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,080
Don't do it because I asked you.

1032
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,600
Do it when you feel like it, Vicky.

1033
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,720
I'm returning to London in 2 days.

1034
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,040
We might not meet after that.
- Shit!

1035
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:54,960
Your brother!

1036
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,720
Huh? Where?
- Over there.

1037
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,840
Excuse me...
- Sir!

1038
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,000
Hide!

1039
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,000
We were almost caught.

1040
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,440
What if your brother saw us?

1041
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,040
My family will get us
married immediately.

1042
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,680
Even I want to get married.

1043
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,360
He always says this.
- I'm getting it, mom.

1044
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,920
Have it, I say.
- Dad, one more?

1045
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,400
It's delicious.

1046
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,360
Vicky!
- Huh?

1047
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,840
Want some chicken?
- No.

1048
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,240
Mutton?
- Maybe later.

1049
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,160
Fish?
- I'm allergic to it.

1050
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,920
He won't eat anything.

1051
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,880
No one noticed. Take it easy.

1052
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,000
Brother-in-law...
- Huh?

1053
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,800
Find an alliance for Nikki too.
We can have her married soon.

1054
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,360
My responsibility will be fulfilled.

1055
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,720
Better.
- Hmm.

1056
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,640
Do it soon, uncle.

1057
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,920
If she's married, I'll convert
her room into my wardrobe.

1058
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,240
If you do that, once I'm married...

1059
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,160
I'll turn your room in your
house into my wardrobe .

1060
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,920
How come?

1061
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,240
Obviously... I'll live in your house...

1062
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,560
Act normal.
Everyone's looking at you.

1063
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,440
Hey Vicky

1064
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,640
What are you doing here?

1065
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,520
Nothing much.

1066
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,720
What's wrong?

1067
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,720
Nikki will be leaving in 2 days.

1068
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,760
No more fun at home.

1069
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,080
We are going to miss her.

1070
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,760
You know Vicky...

1071
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,920
Our family flourished
after Nikki was born.

1072
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,000
She's our lucky charm.

1073
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,200
That's why everyone in the
family comes after her.

1074
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,760
Even your sister
would come after mine.

1075
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,280
Have a place for her in your heart.

1076
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,240
Not in the car's trunk.

1077
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,720
Brother-in-law, that day...
- Relax.

1078
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,000
I know everything.

1079
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,560
You make a good couple.

1080
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,720
You never told me...

1081
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,360
Nikki called just now... Your
parents agreed for the wedding.

1082
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
What happened?

1083
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,520
Are you crazy?
What are you talking?

1084
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,280
If I still don't talk about this
I'll really go mad.

1085
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,000
What's your problem actually?

1086
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,360
Not just one.

1087
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,720
When I'm with her,
I feel so suffocated.

1088
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,280
She wants everything
to happen on her terms.

1089
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:35,120
From the film we watch
to the clothes I wear...

1090
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,120
From the food we eat to the
haircut I need to get...

1091
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,680
She doesn't let me sleep at all.

1092
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,600
Calling and texting
me off the hook.

1093
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,920
I feel like throwing the phone away
and hiding somewhere.

1094
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,960
Why is she controlling me?

1095
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,480
I'm not a bloody Doberman.

1096
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,280
Hey, please calm down.

1097
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,000
She gets me a cake once a week
saying happy anniversary.

1098
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,320
Would anyone in their senses
celebrate a weekly anniversary?

1099
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,520
I can't even look at
a girl by mistake.

1100
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,560
She asks if she's bothering me.

1101
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,600
And talks about marriage
the very next minute.

1102
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,320
When you've got so many issues
Why'd you get your parents involved?

1103
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,240
I did that? You think I did that?

1104
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,720
The very next day after
I asked her not to tell anyone...

1105
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,880
She directly came in to my bedroom.

1106
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,080
She acts way too close with me
in front of our families.

1107
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,040
She throws indirect
hints and blushes.

1108
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,480
Why wouldn't they have a doubt?

1109
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,280
Think about it once, man.

1110
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,120
Nikki is a really nice girl.
She'll be a great wife to you.

1111
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,640
I can't even think of her
as my girlfriend.

1112
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,920
Forget about being my wife.

1113
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,440
I didn't even kiss her until now.
Don't talk about love.

1114
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,560
These are all pretty common
in a relationship.

1115
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,240
You're new to a relationship.

1116
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,080
That is why you are confused.

1117
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,960
But remember one thing.

1118
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:04,440
A girl's life and two families'
equation depend on your word.

1119
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,280
Come on

1120
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,960
Let's have a grand wedding,
sister-in-law.

1121
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,040
They knew each other in London...
- Is it?

1122
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,680
So he planned everything in London
before meeting us...

1123
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,600
Come... Come... You've ended up
being a silent killer, huh?

1124
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,960
You have let things escalate.
Why are you walking so slowly now?

1125
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,320
Your brother is
quite a charmer, dear.

1126
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,120
He managed to impress Nikki.
- But I couldn't impress him, dad.

1127
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,280
Vicky doesn't need me

1128
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,800
Leave it.

1129
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,160
Vicky, this is what
you wanted, right?

1130
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,600
Do you feel okay now?

1131
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,600
Is the suffocation relieved?

1132
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,840
Nikki  What happened?

1133
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,120
Please dad  Let me talk.

1134
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,160
What's your problem with me, Vicky?

1135
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,520
I call and text you way too much.

1136
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,440
I want you to change
according to my taste.

1137
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,000
And I act possessive. Is that it?

1138
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,040
None of this feels wrong to me.

1139
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,560
Because in this relationship
I thought you were my boyfriend.

1140
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,520
But you considered
me an obligation.

1141
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,080
I thought you changed
out of love for me.

1142
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,640
But I realised now that
you were uncomfortable.

1143
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,120
But I wanted to be the
only girl in your heart.

1144
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,480
How can you say
that's wrong, Vicky?

1145
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,480
Every second spent with you was
a celebration to me

1146
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,080
Is it madness, wanting to celebrate
once a week?

1147
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,040
I agree that I couldn't notice
you were uncomfortable.

1148
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,960
But, how could you
not notice my love?

1149
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,040
Yes! We had a deal.

1150
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,320
We shouldn't tell anyone.

1151
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,680
And I broke it. Sorry about that.

1152
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,360
But I love you beyond inhibitions.
I'm helpless.

1153
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,840
I might not give you everything
you expected.

1154
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,920
If that's how my
love is justified...

1155
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,240
I don't want a love
like that, Vicky.

1156
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,800
You know, Vicky?

1157
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,320
I asked God to give
me the right man

1158
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,400
But after realizing
you're not the one...

1159
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,360
I'm much angrier with God than you.

1160
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,960
2 months have ended.

1161
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,680
Now you're free.

1162
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,120
I'm crying at this moment, Vicky.

1163
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,400
I wonder if it's for
you or because of you.

1164
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,200
'Vicky doesn't want me, dad.'

1165
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,440
'Every girl you've ever been
with, acted according to you.'

1166
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,920
'For the first time, a girl wants
you to match her preferences.'

1167
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,400
'That is why you're so confused.'

1168
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,160
'Is the suffocation relieved?'

1169
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,240
'These are all pretty
common in a relationship.'

1170
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,680
'You're new to a relationship.'

1171
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,160
'Two months have ended, Vicky.'

1172
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,280
'You're free now.'

1173
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,240
Vicky

1174
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,480
Vicky, wake up.

1175
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,000
Isn't late for office?

1176
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,680
Make it fast.
Take shower and get ready.

1177
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:00,760
Dad

1178
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,320
Dear  Did you pack everything?

1179
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,800
We'll start in 10 minutes.

1180
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:07,720
Vicky

1181
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,960
JLL employees wanted brochures.
Send them.

1182
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,640
Vicky

1183
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,480
Come have breakfast.

1184
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,560
Good morning

1185
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,040
Hi bro...

1186
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,680
Come have breakfast.

1187
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,160
Make it quick.
I have to go to office.

1188
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,600
Dosa tastes good.
Have one more.

1189
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,760
No, mom. Just serve me another idli.

1190
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,640
Come on! Eat properly.

1191
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,440
Vicky, I'm going to work.
Come fast.

1192
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,160
Bye.

1193
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,080
Vicky

1194
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,880
Vicky, drop Uma at her in-laws
place on your way to work.

1195
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Visit @CC_ALL Movies Telegram Channel..

1196
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,360
Brother.

1197
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,480
"I wonder what happened"

1198
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,080
"Why do my lips act mute?"

1199
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,640
"I wonder what happened"

1200
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,320
"Why does my heart feel burdened?"

1201
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:26,960
"Like a sky void of stars"

1202
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:34,400
"Like a cloud empty of rain drops"

1203
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,800
"This is quite strange"

1204
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,360
"I have no idea where I'm headed"

1205
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,880
"This is quite strange"

1206
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,600
"I wish I knew where
our hearts stand"

1207
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:56,520
"I wonder what happened
Why do my lips act mute?"

1208
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:03,800
"I wonder what happened
Why does my heart feel burdened?"

1209
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,240
"A deep agony with no detail"

1210
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,960
"A trauma that is unshared"

1211
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:59,240
"Have I made the mistake
of letting her go?"

1212
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,640
"No matter who come and go"

1213
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,320
"Smiles fade away at farewell"

1214
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:13,560
"No relation has ever
hit me this hard"

1215
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:19,760
"I live the way you love the most"

1216
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,240
"I can't name the reasons why"

1217
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,720
"I didn't realize
I've changed so much"

1218
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:30,960
Vicky

1219
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,280
I was talking to Uma

1220
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,720
She's pregnant.

1221
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,640
You will be an uncle soon.

1222
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:43,160
"Like the moment
time denies to pass"

1223
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:50,040
"Like the yesterday
that refuses to return"

1224
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,720
"This is quite strange"

1225
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,320
"I have no idea where I'm  headed"

1226
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,760
"This is quite strange"

1227
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:05,320
"I wish I knew where
our hearts stand"

1228
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,920
You're really not angry with me?

1229
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,240
You're still here?

1230
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,920
How you are talking to me normally?
- Come inside.

1231
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,040
You told me every
one comes after her.

1232
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,800
I made her cry.

1233
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,720
Are you seriously
not angry with me?

1234
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,720
Vicky,

1235
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,720
if you had really lied to Nikki
and cheated her...

1236
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,680
I would've killed you.

1237
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,600
Nikki expected something from you

1238
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:31,840
but you couldn't give it to her

1239
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,800
So, she got hurt and went away.

1240
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,160
It's not your mistake.

1241
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,800
But I don't feel the same.

1242
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,760
Since she left, I feel so empty.

1243
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,400
I feel like my heart's torn apart.

1244
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,520
That's how heartbreak feels, Vicky.

1245
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,600
Breakups aren't a new thing to me.

1246
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,000
I didn't say breakup, Vicky.

1247
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,120
I said heartbreak.

1248
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,480
You must have had
so many girlfriends.

1249
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,840
But did you ever listen
to any one of them?

1250
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,640
Did you change for them?

1251
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,760
Did you put up with their anger?

1252
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,840
Did you miss any
one of their presence?

1253
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,680
So

1254
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,200
You didn't love any one of them.

1255
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,920
How will you feel heartbreak then?

1256
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,320
You will feel heartbreak only
when you miss the person you love.

1257
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,680
That means I love...

1258
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,600
Good night.

1259
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,520
Vicky

1260
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,840
I don't see him around.

1261
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,280
He went on a holiday.

1262
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:56,720
Holiday?

1263
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,480
Why all of a sudden?

1264
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,520
Why not?

1265
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,600
Which country did he go to?

1266
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,160
I won't tell you.

1267
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,040
I'm very happy for you.
All the best.

1268
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:07,960
Kill it man!

1269
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:08,880
Thanks.

1270
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,480
Call me after you reach.

1271
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,640
Vicky
- Yes dad

1272
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,960
Have you landed safely?

1273
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,040
Just now.

1274
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,320
Still at the airport.

1275
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,480
Okay. My friend's son is
staying in that city.

1276
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,280
He is a film distributor.

1277
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,880
You can stay with him.
- Why, dad?

1278
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,000
I'm not new to the city,
I'll manage.

1279
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,440
Things were different
back in the past

1280
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,920
Trust me

1281
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,240
He'll be helpful to you..

1282
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,480
Okay. What's his name?

1283
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,400
Pulla Rao...

1284
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,280
Pulla?
- It's Pulla Rao.

1285
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,760
Is it Krishna Prasad on the line?

1286
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,240
Uncle, dad told me everything

1287
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,680
Vicky's time with
Pulla Rao will be great.

1288
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:01,920
Okay? Bye.

1289
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,440
Shall we go? - Give me 2 minutes.
I'm waiting for a delivery.

1290
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:06,800
Okay.

1291
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,640
Where the hell is he?

1292
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,600
Okay, I got it. Shall we move?

1293
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,360
Is that an iPhone?
- It's a copy of Saho.

1294
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,920
It's finally releasing?

1295
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,880
We're releasing it here as
they're taking too long.

1296
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,800
Do you distribute Telugu films too?

1297
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,960
Of course. I do around 70-80
Telugu films every year.

1298
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,840
Producers Dil Raju and Allu Aravind
we release their movies also

1299
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,360
Let's go
- Who are you bro?

1300
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:36,960
Morning, guys!

1301
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,480
Good morning sir.
- Morning sir.

1302
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,120
Oh!

1303
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,640
You run a piracy business?
- Yes.

1304
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,760
We loot the rich producers
and distributors

1305
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,960
To those who're lazy
to watch a movie in theater

1306
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,960
And to those misers who wouldn't
buy a ticket...

1307
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,800
We show them movies for free.

1308
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,360
Isn't it, guys?
- Yes.

1309
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,880
Who do you think is wrong? The thief
or the people who buy stolen stuff?

1310
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,720
You have your business and
I have my problems.

1311
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,440
Okay. Do you have
the girl's address?

1312
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,800
Okay. You get ready.
I'll take you there.

1313
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,040
I'm ready. Let's go.

1314
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,160
Wash your face at least.

1315
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,320
Ready! Let's go.

1316
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,800
You look very desperate.

1317
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,280
Enter the address.

1318
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,280
'You have arrived
at your destination.'

1319
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,720
Don't be in a hurry. Do it calmly.

1320
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,840
'You have arrived
at your destination.'

1321
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,480
This seems like a fake piece.

1322
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,160
Get down.
- Why?

1323
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,520
Just get down. I'll tell you.

1324
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,440
What happened, bro?
- That's the address you're looking for.

1325
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,800
This house?
- Yeah. That's the house.

1326
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,520
Pulla Rao, I love you!
I love you, man! - Hey, stop it!

1327
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,680
Are you here for Nikki?
- Yes.

1328
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,040
That makes you...

1329
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,280
Vicky!

1330
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,640
Vicky!

1331
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,880
Vicky!

1332
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,200
Vicky!

1333
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,360
Where the hell is he?
I'll kill him.

1334
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,560
Where is he?
- Vicky!

1335
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,600
Who's the guy? Where is he?

1336
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,360
Where is he?
- What is this, bro?

1337
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,160
Everyone in this
colony loves Nikki

1338
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,640
She came crying from India and
told them everything

1339
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,520
So, all of them have
deep hatred for Vicky.

1340
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,400
He is Ramesh, Nikki's uncle.

1341
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,680
What the hell?

1342
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,680
Why did I have to hear that name?

1343
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,960
Nikki shouted his name.

1344
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,280
They will kill you
once they find out.

1345
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,520
Is that him?

1346
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,000
I don't know him, uncle.

1347
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,920
Mr. Ramesh, this is Krishna.

1348
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,880
My relative's son...
He's visiting me from India.

1349
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,240
Why'd you say Vicky, dear?

1350
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,720
I was lost in thoughts, uncle.

1351
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,120
I didn't say that to him.

1352
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,960
Give it to me.

1353
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,120
Sir! Sir! Please don't cry
like that. You look really bad.

1354
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,440
I meant to say... We can't see you
like that.

1355
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,440
Sorry, I acted a little angry.

1356
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,960
Did I bother you?
- Nothing like that, sir.

1357
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,720
I was actually surprised to see
so many Telugu people at once.

1358
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,680
Are you in London for the first time?
- Yes sir.

1359
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,480
I've been worried since
I boarded the flight...

1360
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,520
I love Indian food.

1361
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,040
And Pulla Rao can't cook at all.

1362
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:40,040
I've been thinking
about what to do.

1363
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,760
Come on, man!

1364
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,760
Have lunch at our place tomorrow.

1365
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,480
I can't deny your sweet request.

1366
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,520
Krishna, you don't even
know the man's name yet.

1367
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,480
You wait, Pulla Rao!
What's in a name?

1368
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,800
I'm Ramesh.
- Krishna.

1369
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,080
This is my brother's daughter Nikki.

1370
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,840
Hi!
- She's a sweetheart.

1371
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,520
Dear

1372
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,080
Come... Let's go inside.

1373
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,800
This is my wife, Shanti.
- Hello.

1374
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:04,680
Hi!

1375
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,680
This is Krishna.
Pulla Rao's relative... - Oh!

1376
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,040
He came to London today.
- So cute.

1377
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,560
What's his name?
- Konda Babu...

1378
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,200
Konda Babu. - He told them.
He embarrassed me yet again.

1379
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,960
Oh, shit! Everyone's laughing.

1380
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,200
What kind of a name is that?

1381
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,360
Ask him that, uncle.
I'm dying out of shame.

1382
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,200
It doesn't sound like a name.
Sounds more like a curse word.

1383
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,320
That's my grandfather's name.

1384
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,240
Oh, okay

1385
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,520
If you love grandpa so much,
hang his pictures in the hall.

1386
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,600
Naming your kid
after him is suicide.

1387
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,760
Everyone's laughing at me, dad.

1388
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,920
This is Konda Babu. My sweetheart
My little munchkin...

1389
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,800
You don't have to say my name
so many times, mom.

1390
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,080
Okay then. See you at lunch tomorrow.
- Bye.

1391
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,640
Bye.

1392
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,280
Nikki

1393
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,360
Call me if you need anything,
I'll come.

1394
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,880
Hi Nikki

1395
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:53,960
How are you?

1396
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,280
Why'd you come to London?

1397
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,960
I'm really sorry Nikki.

1398
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,840
I hurt you a lot.

1399
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,760
I really love you.

1400
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,160
I really mean it.

1401
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,800
And I want you back in my life.

1402
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,680
Vicky

1403
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,760
Do you know how many times
I told I love you in India?

1404
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:12,760
Don't count.

1405
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,440
I've told you many times.

1406
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,240
Do you know how many times
you've said it back?

1407
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,360
Don't think about it.

1408
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,080
Not even once.

1409
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,280
Go away, Vicky!

1410
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:27,440
Nikki, please!

1411
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,440
What?

1412
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,880
You said you loved me the
other day. But I was in confusion.

1413
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,960
I told you I love you today.
But you're angry with me.

1414
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,360
But I agreed when you wanted to work
on our relationship for 2 months.

1415
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,080
I'm asking you for your time now.
Give me my two months.

1416
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,240
Why?

1417
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,320
I'll make you fall
in love with me again.

1418
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,520
Vicky! You were confused back then.

1419
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,400
But I have great clarity now

1420
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,800
I don't want you!

1421
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,760
So no matter how hard you try
My answer to you will be no.

1422
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,960
Okay. You stick to that.

1423
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,040
I'll try to change that.

1424
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,600
What if my uncle
found out you're Vicky?

1425
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,600
So, he's Vicky.

1426
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,160
If you wanted to, you would've
told him by now.

1427
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,840
You wouldn't have lied.

1428
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,640
Nasty fellow!  He's emotionally
blackmailing my sister.

1429
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,200
Let's try this for 2 months.

1430
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,960
If we love each other,
let's tell everyone.

1431
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,800
Or else...

1432
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,960
Nah! You'll fall in love with me.

1433
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:35,680
He is following her.

1434
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,600
Where are you following her,
man? Stop!

1435
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,800
Hey, Vicky! Stop!

1436
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,400
I'll not spare you
even if sister does.

1437
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,800
I'll chop you into pieces
and dedicate to POGO channel.

1438
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,600
This is for you.

1439
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,920
Take it.

1440
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,960
What's with the formalities, dear?

1441
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,200
You don't have to be so formal,
Krishna.

1442
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,480
Gifts, dear.

1443
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,040
She is not leaving anything behind.

1444
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,440
Don't do that.

1445
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,400
Where is Konda Babu?

1446
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,600
There he is.

1447
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,040
Hey Konda

1448
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,440
Why is he here?
Did they become friends already?

1449
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,000
Keep it.
- I bought gifts for you, too.

1450
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,720
What the hell did you bring me,
huh? Let me trouble you right now.

1451
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,280
Dad! Dad!
He's only Vicky. Kill him!

1452
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,480
Mom! Mom, look.

1453
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,640
Forget about the gifts. Look at me.

1454
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,400
Hey! Hey! Don't take it.
- Take it.

1455
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,840
You shameless brat!
Why'd you take it?

1456
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,400
It's all right. Gifts have nothing
to do with revenge

1457
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,080
Put them inside Shanti
- Hi.

1458
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,720
Small gift for you!

1459
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,080
Sorry! We aren't so close
to exchange gifts yet..

1460
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,160
Excuse me..

1461
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,520
Well done, sister! You've proved
at least one of us is sensible.

1462
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,120
Try this. It's very tasty
- Enough.

1463
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,400
Have some, Pulla Rao.

1464
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,960
You can't fault my
wife's lentils broth.

1465
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,440
That's what all husbands say
in front of guests.

1466
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,800
Pulla Rao!

1467
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,720
If you repeat this
- Sorry

1468
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:03,080
Serve fish to him.

1469
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,720
No, uncle.
Vicky is allergic to fish.

1470
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,480
Sister! Also tell dad he's Vicky.

1471
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,400
He'll feed him Apollo fish to die.

1472
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,320
My name's Krishna. Right, Nikki?

1473
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,360
Hey!
- Nikki

1474
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,760
Who's Vicky, sir?

1475
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,520
He's a idiot.

1476
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,560
He's a rogue who
plays with girls' lives.

1477
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,640
Let me just find him.

1478
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,480
'Who is Vicky, sir?'
You didn't have to mess with him.

1479
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,520
Don't just look at me. Imagine
yourself instead of the meat.

1480
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,760
Vicky!
- What?

1481
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,840
Go

1482
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:49,960
You forgot this.

1483
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,520
That's for you.

1484
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,640
I don't want it.

1485
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,720
Even I don't want it.

1486
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:56,440
I don't want it too.

1487
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,840
Okay. I don't want it back.

1488
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,240
Yes!

1489
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,360
Nikki, please open it.

1490
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,520
Happy anniversary!

1491
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,960
It's been 100 days
since you said you love me.

1492
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:35,680
This is the 15th week.

1493
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,160
Feels bad, huh?

1494
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,720
Nah! I get it.

1495
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,480
I get how much
I hurt you back then.

1496
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,800
Nikki, please

1497
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,720
I put in a lot of
effort to glue it back.

1498
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,560
But I still see the cracks.

1499
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,800
Be it a heart or a doll,
it's the same, Vicky.

1500
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,640
Once broken,
you can't bring it back to life.

1501
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,360
No matter how hard you try,
they aren't the same as before.

1502
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,160
They never become
what they once were.

1503
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,320
You should have smashed the doll
double hard this time.

1504
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,880
You can't be too
kind to him, Nikki.

1505
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:26,720
Forget it, Linda.

1506
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,440
Good morning, students!

1507
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:31,400
Here are your models. You'll
be doing a photo shoot with them.

1508
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,560
Look models are here.

1509
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,160
This is Daniel.

1510
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,520
He is Steve
And Vicky from India.

1511
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,080
So, you can pick your model
for the photo shoot.

1512
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,640
Wow.

1513
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,400
He's hot.

1514
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,880
Hi Vicky
- Hi Vicky

1515
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,360
Hi Vicky
- Hi Vicky

1516
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,480
He's cute.

1517
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,320
I want Vicky.

1518
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,640
I want Vicky.

1519
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:00,960
I asked first.

1520
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,200
I want him.

1521
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,480
Silence, girls!

1522
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,400
I'm going to decide who picks who.

1523
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:12,520
Nikki

1524
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,040
God is for real.

1525
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,680
So, how will you
utilize my services?

1526
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,640
Just a photo shoot or are you interested
in casting couch as well?

1527
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,840
What happened?

1528
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,640
You're lucky that we cast you. Don't have
any expectations for the couch.

1529
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,160
Hey Nikki  I'm late  So sorry

1530
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,640
Basically I left the camera,
and I had to get a train,

1531
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,960
and from the train to the bus...

1532
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,320
And from the bus to the taxi...
- Let her breathe, man!

1533
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,440
Excuse me?

1534
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,080
Go wait inside.
We'll come to you.

1535
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,360
Cool man.

1536
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,480
What are you trying to do?

1537
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,720
I'm guarding you
So that no one hits on you.

1538
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,600
Darn!
- Hey!

1539
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,440
Nikki
- Get lost

1540
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:55,960
One photo

1541
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,600
Nikki listen to me

1542
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,320
Nikki, one minute
- Vicky!

1543
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,520
Bob?
- What are you doing here?

1544
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,320
Guys, pack your bags.

1545
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,840
The playboy is in town.
- Bob

1546
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:11,920
One glance at a girl and
she falls into his arms.

1547
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,200
Bob, please

1548
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,160
You're of another level, man.

1549
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,080
Who is your next prey?

1550
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,600
You acted all decent when we hit
on you this morning.

1551
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,160
You finally got laid with him, huh?

1552
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,720
You look innocent but you're quite
open to things.

1553
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,800
Stop!

1554
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:35,960
Why are you trying to hit him?

1555
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,800
This is the respect I receive
for being with you.

1556
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:42,440
Let's go.

1557
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:54,040
So hot man! One more beer?

1558
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:55,160
No, I'm good.

1559
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,320
I'll have another beer.
- I think his girl is calling.

1560
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,360
Come on, boys!

1561
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,320
What the hell you
are doing with this guy?

1562
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,640
He was just asking
about the summer class.

1563
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,800
How dare are you
talk to my girlfriend?

1564
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,320
How dare you talk ill
of my girlfriend then?

1565
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:41,920
Oh my God!

1566
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,760
Hey! What the...

1567
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:52,800
Do you want to fight?

1568
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,120
Is it okay?

1569
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,320
Is it okay?

1570
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:33,120
Why do you let him hit you?
You should hit him back.

1571
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,880
A guy's character doesn't lie in
the number of girls he's been with.

1572
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:41,320
It lies in the respect
he shows for a girl.

1573
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,360
You're no good in
respecting other girls

1574
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,880
Respect your girlfriend at least.

1575
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,840
Did you have to do this?

1576
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:58,560
I was guarding you. Not just you.
Your respect as well...

1577
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,680
What's this bro? Bahubali-3 movie?

1578
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,360
It's an advanced nanotech camera

1579
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:24,400
Record a video with this and you can't
differentiate with the original.

1580
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,360
Hi
- Hi Sanjay, waiting for you.

1581
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,840
He? - He's carrying sweets
and fruits. Who is he?

1582
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,680
I don't know.
- Is Nikki ready?

1583
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,480
Why should Nikki get ready for him?

1584
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:34,720
I have a doubt, bro.

1585
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,040
Am I this house's owner
or that house's watchman?

1586
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,200
Mr Rama Rao, who was that guy
that visited Nikki's?

1587
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,520
Yeah. It's an alliance for Nikki.

1588
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,800
Alliance?
- Some guy was coming. Is he here?

1589
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,560
Looks like shit.
- You only asked me.

1590
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,560
How long have you been in Dubai?
- We've been settled there for 15 years.

1591
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:50,800
Hi.
- Hi Krishna.

1592
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:51,920
He's here.

1593
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,120
Why did you come now?

1594
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,720
I ran short of coffee powder. I was
thinking if you could lend some.

1595
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,560
Desperate fellow!

1596
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:00,880
Come on, Krishna!
Have a coffee and go.

1597
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,560
Shanti !
- I think you have guests over. We'll go.

1598
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,160
Okay.
- Wait.

1599
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,760
Don't be so formal, Krishna.

1600
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,920
This is Sanjay.
He's here to meet Nikki.

1601
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,760
Oh! To meet our Nikki?

1602
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,960
By the way,
he's done MBA from Harvard.

1603
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:19,240
In fact, his family
has tea estates in Dubai.

1604
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:21,720
So Nikki

1605
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,320
Your uncle told me about your past

1606
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,480
Frankly, everyone has their past

1607
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,200
When I was pursuing MBA in Harvard,
my Psychology professor told me.

1608
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,440
If our past is like a ghost,
build our future like a temple.

1609
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:33,800
Wow.

1610
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,240
You're the ghost. He's the God
in her temple.

1611
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,880
Google quotations!

1612
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:40,960
What Nikki?
- Your wish uncle.

1613
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,840
That's good.

1614
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,280
Dad will be coming back next month.
We'll discuss the rest later.

1615
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,240
Sure.

1616
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,960
Hey! Why do you look so dull?
Sanjay looks good, huh?

1617
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,120
Looks like a darker
version of Sanjay Dutt.

1618
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,280
So... Back to India, huh?
- Do you have a boyfriend?

1619
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,640
Of course.
- Good-ridden he dumps you.

1620
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,480
Jealous guy.

1621
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,760
Wait

1622
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,560
Looks like they almost confirmed
an alliance

1623
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,520
What can I do when
everyone is happy.

1624
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,800
Bring that guy. Let's party.

1625
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:26,920
Either you should drink or beat
the guy who is marrying your lover

1626
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,080
But why are you guys
drinking together?

1627
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,680
I'll tell you.

1628
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,880
Sanjay

1629
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,360
Let's drink one peg.

1630
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,400
No man, only scotch

1631
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,600
Bihar scotch bro
Very famous and strong

1632
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:39,680
Okay.

1633
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,200
Cheers!
- Cheers!

1634
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,120
Bro

1635
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,760
I'll ask you a favour
but don't take it in a wrong way

1636
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,280
Ask bro

1637
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,640
He'll request you to leave Nikki

1638
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:59,040
heard your dad is a big shot in
Dubai. Can you help me settle down?

1639
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:02,840
Sorry, bro.
Dad doesn't recommend anyone.

1640
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,200
You're well settled here.
Why don't you help me out?

1641
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:11,480
Sorry, bro. Jobs are quite tough
to find in my line of work.

1642
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:16,760
Please?

1643
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,960
Sorry bro.

1644
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,240
There's a paper in your pocket.
Read it aloud. -  In my pocket?

1645
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,160
Whoa! When did you put it?

1646
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:29,600
I told you already, Krishna.
- Read it properly.

1647
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,320
NTR's voice...

1648
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:34,120
I told you already, Krishna.
This is how rich kids are.

1649
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,840
They use us poor to their advantage.
But they don't return the favour.

1650
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,840
Oh, I need to say it three times.

1651
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:41,040
They don't return the favour!
They don't return the favour!

1652
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:42,840
It's not like that, bro.

1653
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,120
Flip the paper. - We don't have
jobs for people like you

1654
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,080
ANR's voice...

1655
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:51,440
Krishna, he's denying your request
not out of intoxication...

1656
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,040
But out of arrogance
from being rich.

1657
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,600
You're making me angry.

1658
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:01,160
How could you believe
in him blindly, Krishna?

1659
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,880
Only God can save you now.

1660
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,080
Have you got a matchbox?

1661
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,200
Just read the paper.

1662
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,400
Stop it boss.

1663
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,240
What did you say?

1664
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:13,360
This is why I hate the rich, Krishna.

1665
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,600
Bloody hell!

1666
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:19,280
Hand me that knife, Krishna.
Hand it to me!

1667
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,640
What the hell are you saying, huh?
- Cool down...

1668
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,720
Cool down.
- Who the hell is rich here, huh?

1669
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,800
Your father?

1670
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,840
He's a taxi driver in Dubai.
I drive a taxi here.

1671
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:29,960
That's my taxi car out there.

1672
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,800
What about Harvard
and tea estate in Dubai?

1673
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:33,080
Everyone lies
on these marriage websites.

1674
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,280
No one's asking for the certificates.

1675
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,560
Oh! I told you

1676
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,560
Bro! Please don't tell anyone.
- Okay.

1677
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:49,040
Keep this a secret and I'll set
a great girl for you. - Okay.

1678
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,160
Please, bro  Save me.
- Okay, okay

1679
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,720
Love you, bro.

1680
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,680
You promised me, huh. You too.

1681
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,120
Promise bro.

1682
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,560
Please bro. Good night. Thank you.

1683
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:00,680
He looks like a bigger
loafer than me. I feel so shaken.

1684
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,520
That was a blind shot, right?
- He let his tongue slip this morning.

1685
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,040
'When I was pursuing MBA in Harvard,
my Psychology professor told me.'

1686
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,880
How can MBA have Psychology, bro?

1687
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,080
It's like saying B.Com has Physics.

1688
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,520
'His family has
tea estates in Dubai.'

1689
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:14,640
Dubai is such a barren land.
How can someone harvest tea there?

1690
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,480
Whoa, you're right.
Let's go tell them.

1691
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,160
They must be asleep.
Let's tell them tomorrow.

1692
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,520
Ramesh should be beaten up
for bringing such an alliance.

1693
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,280
No, bro. That's not right.
- You're being too kind, man.

1694
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,080
Forget it. What's the plan?

1695
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:26,880
I'll tell you later.

1696
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:37,840
What happened bro?

1697
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:41,840
I can't find the camera I bought
yesterday, sire.

1698
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,040
Oh...

1699
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,360
By the way,
what's up with Sanjay?

1700
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,200
I will kill you! Stop there!
- What are you doing?

1701
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,280
How dare you cheat me!

1702
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:53,160
Please stop.

1703
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,520
Please listen to me...
Don't get serious.

1704
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,960
Mr Ramesh cool down
- I'll kill you!

1705
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:00,200
What did he do?

1706
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,560
You're behind this, right?

1707
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,760
What did he do?

1708
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,520
Oh my camera!

1709
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:16,800
Bloody hell! Give me the knife.

1710
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,720
Who said I am rich?

1711
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:19,800
Your father?

1712
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,840
He's a taxi driver in Dubai.
I drive a taxi here.

1713
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,360
That's my taxi car out there.

1714
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,360
What about Harvard
and tea estate in Dubai?

1715
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:26,680
Everyone lies
on these marriage websites.

1716
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:28,520
No one's asking for the certificates.

1717
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,440
Thank you for saving Nikki

1718
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:44,160
Calm down.

1719
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:49,280
Now it's my turn.

1720
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,240
Why are you beating me?

1721
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,600
Why are you beating me?

1722
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,880
Ramesh should be beaten up
for bringing such an alliance.

1723
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,440
Don't talk like that.

1724
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,440
You didn't edit it?

1725
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,480
I forgot.

1726
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,120
You'll beat me?

1727
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,440
How can I beat you sir?

1728
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,520
Mind your words.
- Come inside.

1729
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,080
Your dad said you're
coming and said take care.

1730
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:10,840
I thought he asked me
to take good care of you.

1731
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,800
I didn't know he asked me
to take care of myself.

1732
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:14,400
Thanks.

1733
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,120
Sorry bro.
- Enough.

1734
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:24,080
If your angry on me,
then show it on me.

1735
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:31,080
Where is Vicky?
- Oh my God!

1736
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:31,960
Wait there.

1737
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:33,560
He's over there. Behind you.

1738
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:40,720
Hey! Stop it, Linda!
Are you out of your mind?

1739
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:43,320
Let go, Nikki. I have to kill him.
- But why?

1740
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:45,360
My boyfriend dumped me.

1741
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,640
Really?
- Don't laugh

1742
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:48,680
Cool. Cool.

1743
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,280
It's all because of you.

1744
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,760
Wait! Let me tell
everyone you're Vicky.

1745
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,960
It's my duty to bring
you two together

1746
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,920
Okay?

1747
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,480
How?

1748
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:03,280
His longest relationship has been
for around 2 months

1749
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,800
And he's set to revive
a 7 year old relationship.

1750
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,400
Jesus Christ.

1751
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,200
7 year old relationship...

1752
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,200
We've been living
together since 5 years

1753
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,200
I'd make coffee
for her every morning

1754
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,280
I'd hug her before going to work

1755
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,680
Take her out on a candle
light dinner on Saturdays.

1756
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,240
This used to be our routine.

1757
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,480
What went wrong?

1758
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,640
I don't feel like doing any of this
since 6 months.

1759
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,600
Because she doesn't appreciate
anything I do

1760
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,120
We're fighting more often...

1761
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:31,840
And I don't even care to apologize.

1762
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,280
Basically, the magic is gone, bro.

1763
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:42,520
Don't be stupid, Linda.

1764
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,320
If you don't want to make coffee,
it's okay.

1765
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,600
Make tea instead.
- What?!

1766
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,040
Make juice for her otherwise.

1767
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,200
Give her a kiss if you don't want
to hug her.

1768
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:59,080
Take her to a pub instead of
Candle night dinner. Have fun!

1769
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:06,160
If your way of expressing love
isn't right  Find new ways, bro.

1770
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,240
But you can't dump
the girl you love.

1771
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,760
You loved her the
way you like until now.

1772
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,480
Love her the way
she likes from now on.

1773
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,520
Magic doesn't weave in the air.

1774
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:29,920
Man should create it.

1775
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:34,600
Never hesitate to do
something for your girl.

1776
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:37,200
And never forget everything
she does for you.

1777
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,360
Thank her once in
a while if possible.

1778
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:44,280
You wouldn't find the need
to apologise then.

1779
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,600
Thank you so much, Linda.

1780
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:52,320
Thank you.

1781
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:53,920
For putting up with me...

1782
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:55,840
It's okay, darling.
- Thank you.

1783
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:01,600
Hey bro

1784
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,160
What's your name?
- Vicky

1785
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,040
You mean Nikki's Vicky?

1786
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,680
Hey, Nikki... He seems
like a really nice guy.

1787
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:12,560
Yeah, he's so sweet.
Marry him already.

1788
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,480
"Don't gaze at me
with those angry eyes"

1789
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,600
"Don't yell at me looking all cute"

1790
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:57,360
"Don't go away from me in silence"

1791
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:00,560
"I can hear your mischief play out"

1792
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:06,600
"I'll not got to a
bar like Paru's Devdas"

1793
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:10,920
"I'll impress you no
matter how big my fault is"

1794
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:15,440
"I'll not end up a poet
like Laila's Majnu"

1795
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:20,080
"I'll chase after you to eternity"

1796
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:24,560
"I have my heart afloat
like a cloud for you"

1797
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:29,160
"I've written a colorful
poem of love in your name"

1798
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:33,600
"I have my heart afloat
like a cloud for you"

1799
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:38,200
"I've written a colorful
poem of love in your name"

1800
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:47,760
"Don't gaze at me
with those angry eyes"

1801
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,240
"Don't yell at me looking all cute"

1802
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:28,840
"Caress a branch and
ask for its flowers"

1803
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:32,320
"Would it hide them
from your sight?"

1804
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:37,960
"Pushing all your
dreams into nothingness"

1805
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:41,680
"Does it make them
any less of reality?"

1806
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:47,160
"You can't make this love vanish"

1807
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:51,480
"You should be knowing
better than me"

1808
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,920
"A naughty tale that sees no end"

1809
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:00,400
"The beginning is so unsure"

1810
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:03,160
"O' my love..."

1811
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:09,560
"Is the Earth ever
upset with the Sun?"

1812
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:13,920
"Did it ever push the Sun away?"

1813
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:18,360
"I have my heart afloat
like a cloud for you"

1814
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:23,120
"I've written a colorful
poem of love in your name"

1815
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:27,720
"I have my heart afloat
like a cloud for you"

1816
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:32,360
"I've written a colorful
poem of love in your name"

1817
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:43,360
Happy anniversary, Nikki!

1818
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:48,600
What happened?

1819
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,160
Why are you doing this?

1820
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:52,560
You insulted my love back then.

1821
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:54,600
You're reminding me of
the same love and hurting me now.

1822
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:57,280
Did I ask you for all this?
Did I ask you for all this?

1823
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:02,720
I didn't do this because you asked.

1824
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,520
I did it because I felt like it.

1825
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,240
Sorry for making you happy.

1826
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,560
Happy anniversary!

1827
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,800
Caught you!

1828
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,920
My girlfriend left
me because of you.

1829
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:49,520
She got married to someone else.

1830
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:02,840
Vicky!

1831
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:15,000
Who's that chick?
- She is the reason behind all this

1832
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:20,280
Then lets get her.

1833
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,040
Leave her alone.

1834
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,280
Leave her alone!

1835
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:32,680
Vicky.

1836
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:58,720
See.

1837
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:00,360
So simple.

1838
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,800
But you know why I let you hit me?

1839
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,880
You said your girlfriend left you
because of me.

1840
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:10,880
You're in pain.

1841
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,760
I can understand that pain.

1842
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,440
Enough!

1843
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:21,160
Go away.

1844
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,160
He's alone

1845
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,160
Why are you scared?

1846
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:27,440
Get him.

1847
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:52,680
Linda come to the parking lot

1848
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:44,120
My people say that
I play cricket very well.

1849
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:48,040
How dare you hit me with a bat.

1850
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:05,720
Vicky

1851
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:08,240
Vicky

1852
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:12,160
Linda, call the ambulance.

1853
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,640
Vicky are you okay?

1854
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:17,880
Vicky

1855
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:19,160
Hey!

1856
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:30,160
Is he fine Nikki?

1857
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:32,760
Sir, you can see him now.

1858
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:35,200
Nothing to worry, He's fine.

1859
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:57,400
Bro

1860
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:58,960
Nikki is here?

1861
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:00,160
No.

1862
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,280
Nikki  Nikki

1863
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:07,920
Mom
- Sister

1864
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:10,920
Sudden surprise

1865
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,160
They called me after reaching

1866
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,600
You've studied enough.

1867
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:17,720
You're returning to India with us.

1868
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,160
Don't say a word now.

1869
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,600
What happened, mom?
- Don't you know?

1870
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:24,680
I'm talking about the fight at the
exhibition. My heart was pounding.

1871
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:26,280
Mom, please!

1872
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:29,880
Sister, you're afraid for nothing.
Nikki is absolutely fine.

1873
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:34,400
Not even a scratch.
But sadly Krishna

1874
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:36,720
Who's Krishna?

1875
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,640
Yes! This is the day
I've been waiting for.

1876
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:41,000
It's time for all the
secrets to be revealed.

1877
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:43,720
He's our neighbour Pulla Rao's relative.
He's staying with him for a while.

1878
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,720
He's the one who saved
Nikki at the fight.

1879
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:48,640
Really! Let's go thank him, dear.
- Yes.

1880
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:49,920
It's okay, mom.
Don't take the trouble.

1881
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,640
Come on, dear! Thanking him
is our minimum courtesy

1882
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:58,200
I also want to go  Call your dad

1883
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:00,800
What is it, love?

1884
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:03,280
I'll also come, dad. Please.

1885
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:05,880
Konda Babu loves Krishna.

1886
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:07,320
My foot!

1887
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,680
You want to come?

1888
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:10,200
Ya.
- Come on.

1889
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:14,040
Hello, sir! How come you're here?
- Pulla Rao

1890
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,200
My brother and sister-in-law
want to meet Krishna  - Hello!

1891
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:17,840
He supplies piracy
movies in our area.

1892
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:20,160
What are you saying?
- We stopped visiting the theatres.

1893
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:21,760
Krishna
- Yes.

1894
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,720
Ramesh's brother and sister-in-law
are here to meet you.

1895
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:25,400
Why would Ramesh's brother and
sister-in-law want to meet me?

1896
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:26,920
That's what I don't understand.

1897
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,960
Why do you think they came?
Why would they want to meet me?

1898
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,280
Nikki's mom and dad!!

1899
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:35,520
Hide under this.

1900
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:37,640
Who will hide there?
- Fast, fast

1901
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,080
Move. Fast!

1902
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:43,840
Dad, don't put me down
I'll come along  Dad

1903
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,400
Come fast.

1904
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:47,200
Krishna!
- He didn't recover completely.

1905
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,360
Could you come some other time?

1906
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,480
Move.

1907
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:54,280
He is

1908
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:55,920
Krishna.

1909
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:58,360
Nikki must have
introduced him like that.

1910
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,160
Nah! I only introduced
Krishna to Nikki.

1911
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,640
He's Pulla Rao's relative.

1912
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:04,520
What? This piracy
dealer is your relative?

1913
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:06,360
A very distant relative, uncle...

1914
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:07,520
Okay.
- Oh!

1915
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:10,360
Does Nikki know
you two are relatives?

1916
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:13,680
I didn't know until Pulla
Rao told me. How would Nikki know?

1917
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:14,680
Oh
- Oh

1918
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:15,680
Is it?

1919
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,600
He got caught.

1920
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:20,160
Krishna is a really nice guy, brother.
He's nothing like Pulla Rao.

1921
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:21,760
Actually

1922
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:24,360
Nikki has changed
a lot since Krishna came.

1923
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:27,200
He made her forget Vicky and
get back to normal.

1924
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:28,640
He's a miracle, bro.

1925
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:32,320
I have full clarity now.

1926
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,320
Yay! Movie has reached
the climax now.

1927
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:37,040
So

1928
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:40,360
So, Nikki doesn't
know who Krishna is.

1929
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,040
No!
- You introduced him to Nikki?

1930
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:42,920
Yes.

1931
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,960
Introduce him to us as well.
- Okay.

1932
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:46,440
What a twist!

1933
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,040
Krishna,
that's my brother and his wife.

1934
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,600
Brother and sister-in-law,
he's Krishna.

1935
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:55,880
My dad gave me a
name meaning robust.

1936
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,360
But he is viewed by
everyone as vigorous.

1937
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,120
Thank you.

1938
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,640
Krishna is a nice guy, brother.

1939
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:29,440
Dear, coffee.

1940
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,400
Oh... You made it?
- Hmm.

1941
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:38,000
In such a short time, he grew
closer to everyone.

1942
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,440
I was thinking that he's
the perfect man for Nikki.

1943
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,560
Do what you feel is right.

1944
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:47,160
I have full confidence
in your decision.

1945
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:48,080
Thank you.

1946
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:51,800
What just happened?

1947
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:54,640
God! Bless me with the voice

1948
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,400
I can't take this torture anymore.

1949
01:58:57,240 --> 01:59:00,040
Guys, I'm going to India for
10 days. It's my friend's wedding.

1950
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:02,520
By the time I'm back, make sure
piracy market is blooming.

1951
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:04,240
Is it okay?
- Okay, captain.

1952
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:07,720
Whose marriage is it, bro?
- Yours, dear.

1953
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:09,080
Mine?
- Yeah.

1954
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:10,400
I just heard the public talk.

1955
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,920
Everyone has decided
on your marriage with Nikki.

1956
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,080
I heard Nikki had agreed too.

1957
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:16,360
Really?
- Yes.

1958
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:18,200
Thank you bro.

1959
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:22,480
Even if you shout your name
out loud, no one can trouble you.

1960
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:23,560
Correct.

1961
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:28,960
Pulla Rao is right, Vicky.

1962
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:31,080
No one can trouble you.

1963
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:32,880
Not just today.

1964
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:35,720
Even if they knew the
very first day you came...

1965
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:37,480
They would've done nothing to you.

1966
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:41,720
That's because you work your charm
in a split second.

1967
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,240
You make everyone
fall in love with you.

1968
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:46,480
You impressed me.

1969
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:48,080
Everyone else is not a big task.

1970
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:53,880
Vicky, you came here for me.

1971
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,320
You acted the way I like.

1972
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:56,920
You tolerated all my anger.

1973
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:00,200
But I loved you before
you did any of this.

1974
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:03,160
And I'll continue to love you even
if you do none of this.

1975
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:06,120
But, I don't want you, Vicky.

1976
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:07,720
I don't want you.

1977
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:15,400
That's because you
don't love me, Vicky.

1978
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,960
You just assume you love me.

1979
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:22,320
I'm the first girl in your life
who's hurt by you.

1980
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:24,160
That guilt is hurting you.

1981
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:27,920
This is sheer guilt, Vicky.
Not love.

1982
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,720
Don't get confused.

1983
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,600
Do you really think
I don't love you?

1984
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:38,320
Look into my eyes and tell me.

1985
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,080
No, Vicky.

1986
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:47,120
That's because I've never heard
any truth from you.

1987
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:50,080
Even now, you're growing
closer to me with a lie.

1988
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:52,960
I don't trust you, Vicky.

1989
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:57,400
If you leave right now,
I'll cry my eyes out for 10 days.

1990
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,160
I'll move on!

1991
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:02,160
But if I have to stay with you...

1992
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,960
I'll doubt if you love me or not.

1993
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:07,960
I'll fear that you might leave me.

1994
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,480
I'd have to live with that.

1995
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:11,160
I don't want such a life.

1996
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,480
Because I don't want
to beg for your love.

1997
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:18,960
Please leave!

1998
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,960
Please Nikki

1999
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:23,480
Please

2000
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:27,040
Please
- Please, Vicky. Let go. I'll leave.

2001
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:31,600
Let me go, Vicky. Please!

2002
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:33,680
No.
- Please.

2003
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:35,480
No Nikki

2004
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:00,280
Go away, Vicky!

2005
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:31,880
"Are we bidding
adieu to each other?"

2006
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:36,800
"Are we letting go
of so called love?"

2007
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:41,880
"My heart doesn't get
to hear from you again"

2008
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:46,840
"Yet, it is true
that you fill it up"

2009
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:52,760
"Is it possible for
me to forget you?"

2010
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:57,880
"Am I at fault for
having met you?"

2011
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:02,800
"For responding to
your love with denial"

2012
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:07,600
"For ending up as an
unanswered question"

2013
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:10,480
"I'm leaving you behind in pain"

2014
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,960
"I'm the deepest wound within you"

2015
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:16,800
"Time has left me
with a bitter taste"

2016
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:23,080
"Destination is in reach
Yet, I stand off the path"

2017
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:26,760
"Though distance
has been in favour"

2018
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:52,600
"Are we bidding
adieu to each other?"

2019
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:57,600
"Are we letting go
of so called love?"

2020
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:23,120
"I shall put on a smiling face"

2021
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:28,280
"I shall hide the
tears you had rolling"

2022
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:33,320
"I shall appear like
a sweet fantasy"

2023
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:38,320
"I shall cloak the
pain my dreams behold"

2024
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:43,480
"I shall take you for
a forgotten memory"

2025
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:48,760
"I shall present you as a stranger"

2026
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:56,240
"Life turns into an act
Light lets shade take over"

2027
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:59,960
"I've had enough of this game"

2028
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:03,880
"You're unforgettable"

2029
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:06,240
"Your love is the testament"

2030
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:11,360
"It's not easy to part ways"

2031
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:26,480
"Is our union a boon or a curse?"

2032
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:31,480
"Is it fair in love to separate?"

2033
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:42,080
On the day we met, you
asked me a question.

2034
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:45,680
Who is wrong? The thief or the
people who buy stolen stuff?

2035
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,400
If you stop stealing stuff...

2036
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,120
Many would stop making a mistake.

2037
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:56,720
Hard earned money ends up in your pocket
no matter how reckless you are.

2038
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:02,240
But the money earned through
wrong means doesn't last.

2039
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:06,800
I didn't have the liberty
to tell you at our first meet.

2040
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,280
If I still don't tell you...

2041
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:10,280
Our friendship has no meaning.

2042
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:11,560
Take care.

2043
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:33,560
What happened?

2044
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:35,200
Why is everyone so serious?

2045
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:36,720
Vicky came here.

2046
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:40,880
Ya, sure

2047
02:06:41,080 --> 02:06:42,080
We'll catch up in the evening.

2048
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:43,240
Hi Krishna

2049
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,640
We were just talking about you.

2050
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:47,520
Please come. Have a seat.
- One second.

2051
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:49,960
Actually I have
something to tell you.

2052
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:54,920
My name is Vikram Krishna.

2053
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:56,160
Okay.

2054
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:58,280
Vicky.

2055
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:05,080
He told it.

2056
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:10,680
Vicky!
- Please wait, uncle.

2057
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,160
It's entirely my fault.

2058
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:20,120
When Nikki said we'd love
each other for 2 months...

2059
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:22,960
I was only thinking
about those 60 days.

2060
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:28,160
But Nikki imagined a life with me
beyond those 60 days.

2061
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:35,040
I couldn't give her
the love she wanted.

2062
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,800
So, she left.

2063
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:39,760
I'm back to win her
love again this time.

2064
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:41,880
But I lost her trust.

2065
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:46,040
I'm leaving.

2066
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:48,400
So, he left right?

2067
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:49,520
What now?

2068
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:54,240
Nikki, all of us can see his love
for you. Why can't you feel it?

2069
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:58,240
Because there's no honesty
in his love. It's filled with lies.

2070
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:00,480
If he has a problem with me,
he should come talk to me.

2071
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:01,800
Not his friends...

2072
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,240
When I asked if I was bothering
him, he should tell me the truth.

2073
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:05,400
Not a damn lie...

2074
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:07,360
You can question him
in front of two families

2075
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,640
when you overheard him rant about you.

2076
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:12,600
You can speak ill of him to an
entire colony in London.

2077
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:17,320
But he can't share his emotions
with his friend, right?

2078
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:22,520
Lies go hand in hand
with a relationship.

2079
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:24,600
Forget everyone else

2080
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:26,400
Take your dad for example.

2081
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:28,880
In 30 years of our marriage,

2082
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,640
he never drank my coffee.

2083
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:36,320
How long does it take to tell me
he doesn't like it?

2084
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:41,440
But he must have thought
I'll be hurt if he said so.

2085
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:45,320
Doesn't that mean he loves me?

2086
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:49,320
I see...

2087
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:51,760
Love in his lies.

2088
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:53,640
But you...

2089
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:56,480
You see lies in his love.

2090
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:08,040
Nikki told me

2091
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:10,560
Be it a broken doll or a heart...

2092
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:12,920
No matter how and you try,

2093
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:15,200
you can't bring it back to life.
It'll never be the same as earlier.

2094
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:19,200
I tried, uncle.

2095
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:22,400
I tried to mold it to look
more beautiful than before.

2096
02:09:26,440 --> 02:09:29,800
But Nikki's heart can't go beyond
the cracks and look at its beauty.

2097
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:41,640
I hope she notices
that beauty someday.

2098
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:43,080
Let me talk to her once.

2099
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:44,920
No, auntie. I deserve this.

2100
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:47,720
Auntie, you know it

2101
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:51,080
I didn't know what
love or pain was.

2102
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:56,760
Once Nikki left me,
I realised what love is.

2103
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:01,920
And when she said she doesn't
want me anymore...

2104
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:04,120
I realised how pain feels.

2105
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:07,520
A pain so shattering that...

2106
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:10,960
I would've felt it
if I witnessed my mom's death.

2107
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,400
I would...

2108
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:21,960
I'm crying!

2109
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,120
It's obvious.

2110
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:29,720
It's the karma of
hurting Nikki so badly.

2111
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:43,640
You must have longed to do this.

2112
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:46,400
To hit Vicky when you face him...

2113
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,520
Go ahead!

2114
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:50,720
At least your anger
will be released.

2115
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:19,280
Did he cry, dad?

2116
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:23,320
Did he cry for me?

2117
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:27,720
You know he never
cried in his life.

2118
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:29,440
Don't you feel sorry?

2119
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:31,120
All of you were right here.

2120
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:32,960
You still couldn't
stop him from leaving.

2121
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:37,320
Damn!

2122
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,680
You should have tied
him up until I came.

2123
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:41,520
You're all such a waste.

2124
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:44,880
I'll only go get him.

2125
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:04,160
Nikki
- Hey Nikki

2126
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:10,400
You're so flirtatious all the time.

2127
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:13,160
It's her wedding.
She just gave her card.

2128
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:18,800
Sorry.

2129
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:20,640
It's okay.

2130
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:23,160
Why don't you answer my calls?

2131
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:26,360
Phone was on mute.

2132
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:28,160
You changed back to
your old clothes, huh?

2133
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:30,480
I'm traveling.
I need to be comfortable.

2134
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:33,400
Why are you leaving suddenly?
- You only asked me to go.

2135
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:34,640
So?

2136
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:36,960
Will you just follow my orders
like a school kid?

2137
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:38,720
Okay. I don't care of you go.

2138
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:40,800
I'm not here to stop you.
- Why'd you come then?

2139
02:13:42,280 --> 02:13:43,840
I came to return the doll.

2140
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,720
Come on, give it!

2141
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:52,560
Okay.

2142
02:13:57,480 --> 02:13:58,400
Stop!

2143
02:13:58,520 --> 02:13:59,480
Give me that.

2144
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,920
You really don't understand
why I came here?

2145
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,280
Or are you doing this on purpose?

2146
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:07,880
I came. I cried.

2147
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,080
I slapped her.
Yelled at you for nothing.

2148
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:11,400
And I'm talking crap.

2149
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:13,200
How else do I have to tell you?
- Nikki

2150
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:14,880
I understood everything the minute
you arrived.

2151
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:16,920
But you hurt my ego in the morning.

2152
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:18,440
So I was just playing with you.

2153
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:43,200
Didn't I tell you? I'll kiss you
when I feel like it.

2154
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:46,320
Happy anniversary!

2155
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:51,360
Happy anniversary!

2156
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:58,160
You know this is my first kiss.

2157
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,160
But to me...

2158
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:01,960
I'll kill you if
you say the number.

2159
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:05,280
I love you Nikki!

2160
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:06,960
I love you more.

2161
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:08,800
You'll take good care of me, right?

2162
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:10,280
Hmm.

2163
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:12,160
You'll stop lying, right?

2164
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:13,800
Hmm.

2165
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,800
You'll stop flirting
with girls, right?

2166
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:19,040
Tell me!

2167
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:21,080
Hmm.

2168
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:23,800
Promise?

2169
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:25,440
Promise.

2170
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:28,840
Wait. Wait.

2171
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:31,680
Ya, where are you?

2172
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:36,280
He must have told
someone a really big lie.

2173
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:41,480
I'm so sorry, Officer.

2174
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:44,480
I was in a hurry and I
didn't realise how I parked it.

2175
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:47,720
Sorry, ma'am  You'd have to talk
to my superior about that.

2176
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:13,640
Don't look at her
- Vicky

2177
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:15,440
Will you go talk to her?

2178
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,560
Me?!
- Yeah.

2179
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:20,360
Sure?
- Yeah.

2180
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:23,360
Okay, I'll go talk.
You sit in the car.

2181
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:24,480
Okay.

2182
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:54,880
Excuse me, Miss!

2183
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,040
English is a funny language, I say.

2184
02:16:57,800 --> 02:17:01,440
The one we're not supposed to miss
is called as Miss.

2185
