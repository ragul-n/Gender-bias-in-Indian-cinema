Discovery of the Chinese

15
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:06,044
We no longer need to write
on leaves and textiles anymore

16
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,354
In our present predicament...

17
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:09,083
...we don't need these fancy gifts

18
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:10,386
Marco Polo

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,101
We need an escape plan

20
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:17,331
Because I don't have a male heir...

21
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:22,861
...I was compelled to comply
and bow my head to our enemies

22
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,614
You have travelled around the world

23
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:30,325
You were granted an audience by
Genghis Khan's grandson Kublai Khan

24
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:31,613
With your worldly knowledge...

25
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:35,721
...hoping you would help us
with an escape strategy

26
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:37,394
...we invited you here

27
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:58,496
Then you must learn more about
the mighty Kakatiya emperor...

28
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:03,821
...who became the supreme ruler
of the Telugu kingdom

29
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:06,969
Who is that mighty emperor?

30
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:14,495
Rudramadevi

31
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:23,973
'The Kakatiya reign that spread
fame in all 8 directions...'

00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:25,899

00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:47,435
Praise be to Goddess Kakatamma
consort of Lord Shiva, destroyer of evil

40
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,813
King Ganapati Deva's wife,
our queen will deliver a royal heir

41
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,617
This news will be announced shortly

42
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:06,982
If our queen gives birth
to a daughter...

43
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:10,117
...king of Devagiri's army will
lay siege and enslave us again

44
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,626
'The hell we suffered when they held
King Ganapati Deva captive is enough'

45
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:21,890
If the same situation arises
we might as well die

46
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:24,257
We only want a prince to be born!

47
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:25,588
God Rudralinga

48
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,683
Bless our queen
with a little prince

49
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:31,131
Guardian deity Ellamma!

50
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:33,191
Let our queen be
blessed with a baby boy

51
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:35,458
Guardian deity Ellamma!
Bless us with a little prince

52
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,785
My dear brother
Hari Hara Deva

53
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:41,926
Look how high the expectations
of the people are

54
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,835
They want our old cousin
to have a son

55
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:47,491
If it's a daughter...

56
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:48,860
(scornful laughter)

57
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,129
...it will be a case of
empty expectations!

58
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:56,017
What you said is absolutely true

59
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:00,431
King Ganapati Deva is not
destined to have a male heir

60
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:02,640
Only a girl baby will be born

61
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:07,102
With the help
of buried treasure...

62
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:10,409
...to complete building
the 7 walls of the fort

63
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,706
...as an incarnate of Goddess Shakti

64
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,260
...that girl child will save
our entire kingdom

65
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:16,322
Women...!

66
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:23,106
To satiate the desires of men
and to serve their every need...

67
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:26,041
...Lord Brahma created
this beautiful angel called 'girl'

68
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:29,352
Not to rule a kingdom

69
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,688
Keep aside the king's horoscope

70
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:35,035
Check if my master's horoscope
predicts he will ascend the throne

71
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:38,406
The Kakatiya throne
belongs to us

72
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:41,758
Find the auspicious date
for our coronation

73
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:45,684
Murari Deva

74
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:48,884
Ask the feudal chieftains
who favor us to be prepared

75
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:52,753
As soon as his daughter is born
if the king renounces his throne...

76
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,807
...at least his life will be spared

77
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:57,251
Otherwise he will set foot
on his journey to Heaven

78
00:05:57,564 --> 00:05:59,599
Your words echo
my thoughts, brother

79
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:04,485
My lord, unaware of the fact
you are the local thieves here...

80
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:08,013
...they are afraid of king Singhana
of Devagiri who is our neighbor

81
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:10,238
If he lays siege on our land...

82
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,756
...we will be wiped out

83
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:14,106
Dust to ashes!

84
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:16,090
'Devagiri kingdom'

85
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:18,467
To close the chapter of
the Kakatiya dynasty...

86
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:20,681
...get our troops
ready for action

87
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:25,578
Sharpen your weapons which will
slash even eye lashes to pieces!

88
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:29,517
Heighten the spirits of cavalry
and elephantry with spirits!

89
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:31,643
Make them mighty and strong

90
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,094
If a daughter is born
to king Ganapati Deva...

91
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:36,887
...he and his people
will be broken hearted

92
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,132
Right then let the death-bell toll

93
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,126
That ring is the invitation
for us to advance and attack

94
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:45,367
I will gift the Kakatiya Kingdom...

95
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:50,170
...to my 2nd grandson, Mahadeva

96
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:53,179
Soldiers, get ready to fight

97
00:07:04,017 --> 00:07:05,668
'Kakatiya kingdom'

98
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,490
Good news, my lord

99
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:22,660
Queen Somambadevi has given
birth to a beautiful girl baby

100
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,456
You indeed gave me good news

101
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:30,378
But this is not
the wish of the people

102
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:32,745
They wanted a male heir

103
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:35,324
When this news reaches
our enemies' ears...

104
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:37,814
...they will probably
be happier than us

105
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:42,619
Shiva Devaiah, even before
you gave me this good news...

106
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:45,943
...I got the news
through my spies

107
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:52,102
Our enemies of Devagiri are sharpening
their swords to attack our people it seems

108
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:56,656
Our allies and feudal chieftains
are eyeing our throne with interest

109
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,584
We can stop them temporarily

110
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:02,504
But what will become of
our kingdom without a male heir?

111
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:05,447
Should my people
be enslaved again?

112
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:09,575
What will be the future
of my clan and my kingdom?

113
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,665
Only if there is no male heir
should you be scared

114
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,059
What are you saying?

115
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:14,890
Your Majesty!

116
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,581
The gender of the baby is known
only to my wife who was the midwife...

117
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:21,447
...our queen, you and me

118
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:26,308
This child born as an incarnate
of Lord Shiva as Rudra...

119
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:28,568
...let us name her Rudramadevi

120
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:34,217
To our people we will introduce him
as the prince Rudradeva

121
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:37,163
You want me to lie and
deceive my own people?

122
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:40,808
To avoid danger, we should
forget the word 'impossible'

123
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:44,504
Not only to our enemies
and our own people

124
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:49,966
Even the new born baby
should never know she is a girl

125
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:54,801
Heir to the Durjaya dynasty

126
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:59,127
The future prince
of the Kakatiya kingdom

127
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:05,520
Sri Sri Sri Rudradeva
The little prince

128
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:08,694
Long live prince Rudradeva

129
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:11,829
Long live our future heir to the throne

130
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:15,869
Long live our little prince

131
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:25,780
Can you hear that?

132
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:28,491
The sound of people cheering

133
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:32,811
Heir to the throne and
our enemy is born

134
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:34,128
Rudradeva!

135
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:36,150
The scriptures cannot go wrong

136
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,962
Birth and death are God's will

137
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:41,377
God writes, huh?

138
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:46,354
Your death is
written in our hands

139
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:59,964
'Unable to kill the new born baby
they killed the astrologer'

140
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:03,492
He wasn't even lucky enough
to wear this pearl necklace

141
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,741
Ganapati Deva has a son?

142
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:09,141
A new enemy is born
for our Devagiri dynasty

143
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,912
And to top it all, he is named
after Lord Shiva as Rudradeva

144
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:16,540
My father Jaitugi,
king of the Yadavas...

145
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,156
...brutally killed Rudradeva,
Ganapati Deva's uncle

146
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:23,228
They have named
this child after him!

147
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:26,938
This feud has been spouting
hatred for 2 generations

148
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:30,697
Is he extending this enmity
to the third generation?

149
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,734
Ganapati Deva has
not forgotten anything

150
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,839
Shall we wage a war, Your Majesty?

151
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,893
Happiness is half the strength

152
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:42,017
To Ganapati Deva, his male heir
gives strength equal to the mountain

153
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:44,746
Let us be calm for a while

154
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:48,021
The chance to dethrone Ganapati Deva
has slipped from our hands

155
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:50,314
If you are scared
of the new male heir...

156
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,186
...what can we do, Your Majesty?

157
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:54,783
Army chief

158
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:59,552
Do you think I will be scared
of the Kakatiya male heir?

159
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:00,767
No

160
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,010
Not at all

161
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:05,568
Right before my eyes my grandson
is growing up like a hungry tiger's cub

162
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:07,126
Mahadeva

163
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:12,946
First tell our prince, knives are
not used to cut nails

164
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:25,534
Knives cut necks
as well as nails!

165
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:30,565
Grandfather, whenever the time
is right, Orugallu fort is mine

166
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,651
Kakatiya crown is also mine

167
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:37,106
'Secret hide-out in a dense forest'

168
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:01,163
Bravo! Rudradeva

169
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:04,454
Your swordsmanship is
noteworthy at this young age

170
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:06,575
Like Karna's armor and ear-ring...

171
00:12:07,016 --> 00:12:09,550
...this armor and sword
will be your strength

172
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,026
To me Shiva Devaiah's order
is like Lord Shiva's command!

173
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:47,920
Rudradeva, to combat your enemies...

174
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:51,631
...and protect your kingdom
your training ends today

175
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:56,454
Life will now teach you how to
uphold justice and Dharma

176
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:59,231
Your coronation awaits you

177
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,949
Let us now proceed to Orugallu

178
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:12,757
Welcome, prince of Kakatiya kingdom

179
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:20,005
The dove Shiva Devaiah
has taught to fly...

180
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,450
...has flown into the fortress after 14 years

181
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:26,082
Tomorrow or day after this bird
will be sacrificed by our sword or spear

182
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,265
(Holy chant)

183
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,209
Salutations to my father

184
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:46,583
Long live prince Rudradeva

185
00:13:57,231 --> 00:14:00,111
Rudradeva, these princes are here
to greet and welcome you...

186
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,595
...from our neighboring kingdoms

187
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,302
Veerabhadra Chalukya
Prince of Nidavartyapuram

188
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:07,631
Hail Veerabhadra Chalukya

189
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,346
Long live
Veerabhadra Chalukya

190
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,835
On the banks of
our river Godavari...

191
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:18,115
...we have heard many
stories of your valor

192
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,137
Will you consent to
clash swords with me?

193
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,041
Prince of Vardamanapuram

194
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,372
Son of Gona Buddha Reddy

195
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,873
Prince Gona Ganna Reddy

196
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:28,342
Welcome Gona Ganna Reddy

197
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:34,725
Hail Gona Ganna Reddy

198
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:37,489
Prince, it seems
you are a brave warrior

199
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:40,041
Are you prepared
for a duel with me?

200
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,242
He is 2 years younger than you

201
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:49,765
But in warfare tactics...

202
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:52,440
...he is the bravest of the brave
Gona Ganna Reddy

203
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:53,652
Really?

204
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:55,021
Challenge

205
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:18,551
The way you swirl your sword...

206
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:21,648
...looks like you will be my only rival
in this kingdom, Ganna Reddy

207
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,558
Gona Ganna Reddy

208
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:28,005
Prince, you are wanted back
in Vardamanapuram at once

209
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:31,583
Your father's younger brother
Lakkumaiyah Reddy has sent word

210
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,066
Leave immediately

211
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,772
I take leave, prince

212
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,231
We will meet again in
'The festival of the Brave heart'

213
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:39,753
I take leave, sir

214
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:46,188
His father, Gona Buddha Reddy
has passed away unexpectedly

215
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:48,891
Vardamanapuram is in a state of shock

216
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,740
This news is so distressing

217
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,568
Even a warrior has
to face distress

218
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:56,705
Do not get dejected, young prince

219
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,542
If we roam around
the streets of Orugallu...

220
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,295
...you will feel relaxed
and rejuvenated

221
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,777
- Come with me
- What?

222
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,312
Outside the fort?

223
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,050
I am not allowed to step out

224
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:09,069
Permission?
That too for you?

225
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:12,705
It won't be interesting
if you are bound by rules always

226
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:15,539
But if Shiva Devaiah gets to know?

227
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:17,431
We'll be back
before he finds out

228
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:18,733
Come quickly

229
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,100
My dearest friend...!

230
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:46,724
This waterfall jumps in joy
just like us and weaves its way

231
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,206
I also grew up amidst
these trees and creepers

232
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:56,286
But do you know how happy I feel
roaming around with you like this

233
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,298
Is this what you came
running to see, prince?

234
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,736
Did this beautiful sculpture
lure you here?

235
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:14,010
Poets and sculptors have
varied vivid imagination

236
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:16,846
With unlimited imagination
and aesthetic sense...

237
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:19,786
...they create women
in wonderful poses

238
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,088
Woman?

239
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:23,561
Then what...?

240
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,968
Did you see the beauty
of her upper torso?

241
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:29,689
Only Rati, the Goddess of Love
is blessed this way

242
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:34,082
Only the apsara Menaka
has such a petite waist like this

243
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:35,939
Urvasi's full lips

244
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:37,692
Graceful curve of Rambha's neck

245
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:41,117
All these sculpted together
is this beautiful work of art

246
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:44,882
There is no other girl
as beautiful on this earth

247
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:46,310
Girl...?

248
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,388
Then...?

249
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:51,395
Instead of a female, can a male
possess such graceful curves?

250
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:54,913
'Will you skinnydip
in the river with us?'

251
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,629
Outside, in the open?

252
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:59,807
When girls bathe together...

253
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,364
...why can't we boys
do the same?

254
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,363
Climb up

255
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:11,380
Come, my dear prince

256
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:29,319
Rudradeva...!

257
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:09,251
Mother?

258
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,313
Amma?

259
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:12,773
Ma...?

260
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:15,487
Mother

261
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:18,301
There is no difference
between you and me, right?

262
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:21,590
Why are you dressed like this then?

263
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,221
Why did you raise me like this?

264
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,453
Come, dear

265
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,782
Ma...?

266
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:39,595
Oh! My dear child

267
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,307
'Not just your upbringing'

268
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:52,556
'Even raising you like this is essential
for the history of our kingdom'

269
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,524
To stop the annexing greed
of neighboring countries...

270
00:20:56,777 --> 00:21:00,233
...to retain the resources and
cultural heritage of our land

271
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:02,452
...instilling fear in enemies

272
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:05,050
...we should be a strong
and very powerful kingdom

273
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:06,679
Satavahanas

274
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:07,927
Ikshvakus

275
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,201
Vishnukundinas

276
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:12,302
And after the Chalukyas of Vengi...

277
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:14,788
...our Kakatiya kingdom
is the most powerful

278
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:17,917
Enemies on all 4 sides are
Yadavas of Devagiri, Seuna

279
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:19,060
Pandyas

280
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:20,283
Tribes from Turpu

281
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:21,591
Hoysalas

282
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:25,340
We are surrounded by scheming
and self centered allies

283
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:28,501
These power-crazy
crafty foxes thrive here

284
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,817
In our kingdom known
for its righteous rule...

285
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,160
...common people will suffer
much more than our soldiers

286
00:21:34,522 --> 00:21:38,285
If our enemies had got wind of
our heir-apparent's gender right then...

287
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,616
...our Kakatiya kingdom would have
merged with the dust long ago

288
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,424
Noose for kings

289
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:45,369
And handcuffs around people's wrists

290
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:47,928
...our culture and lineage
would have perished

291
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:50,826
'To infuse fear into
our enemies' minds...'

292
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:52,971
'...confidence in the hearts
of our own people'

293
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:56,470
'...we were forced to lie about
your birth and upbringing'

294
00:21:58,003 --> 00:22:01,190
As a child it was easy
for us to convince our subjects

295
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,002
Now that she has
attained puberty...

296
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,667
...is it right to make them
believe she is a boy?

297
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:11,755
Till date we were able to
achieve what we had planned

298
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,935
Now whatever maybe
the repercussion...

299
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:17,091
...we have to face it

300
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,273
We shall announce
in the assembly

301
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:25,511
Make the necessary arrangements

302
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:06,392
You took a bold decision
for the welfare of our kingdom

303
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:10,185
I shall remain as Rudradeva
till that goal is fulfilled

304
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,045
'10 years later'

305
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:35,687
King's kith and kin

306
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:38,674
Hari Hara Deva and Murari Deva's
brother-in-law Nagadeva...

307
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:42,122
...is coming to tame
the mad elephant

308
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,337
Come

309
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,283
Come

310
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:16,588
Face me

311
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:29,338
Like tugging the sari off a woman...

312
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:31,168
...he thought it easy
to tame an elephant

313
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:38,721
Is there no brave man in Orugallu
to tame this mad elephant?

314
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:40,559
How can that be, Prasad Aditya?

315
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:41,225
Of course there is

316
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,721
Our valiant prince Rudradeva

317
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:47,290
Even if you don't remember...

318
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:48,736
...we haven't forgotten

319
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:53,198
Fearless and courageous

320
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,507
As brave as a lion and
one who knows all the tricks

321
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:56,607
All that is mere folklore

322
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:59,075
We haven't seen the valor
of our prince face to face

323
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:01,286
Despite being your kith and kin

324
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,312
Even the people of our kingdom...

325
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:06,899
...have not set eyes on
prince Rudradeva it seems

326
00:25:07,614 --> 00:25:10,801
Will our prince appear
at least today being a special day?

327
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:15,750
Will we be blessed
by his august presence?

328
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:19,251
We want Rudradeva
The young prince

329
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:21,350
We want to see our prince

330
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:23,497
Rudradeva, our future king

331
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:25,625
Your Majesty

332
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:29,552
It is the king's duty to fulfill
the wishes of his people

333
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:32,938
Prasad Aditya

334
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,849
Ask Rudradeva to come

335
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:39,435
'Already this elephant is wild'

336
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:42,210
'If I feed this brew, I dread
to think of the prince's plight'

337
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,138
Our future king
prince Rudradeva

338
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,056
Bravest warrior on earth

339
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:49,088
Welcome prince Rudradeva

340
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:03,075
Long live prince Rudradeva!

341
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,651
(loud cheers)

342
00:27:47,936 --> 00:27:49,510
Chief minister

343
00:27:50,654 --> 00:27:54,302
My eyes perceive
Rudradeva as a lion

344
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:42,663
Long live young prince Rudradeva

345
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:46,182
(continuous cheering)

346
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,944
Our future king
Prince Rudradeva

347
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:55,121
Long live!

348
00:28:55,822 --> 00:28:59,806
The bravest of the brave

349
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,674
Long live

350
00:29:06,906 --> 00:29:08,212
Long live!

351
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:13,891
Who told you the Hindu God of love
Manmadha has no form, Ganapamba?

352
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:15,752
Look over there

353
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:19,696
Perfection in form and skill
is your brother Rudradeva

354
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:24,370
To prevent young girls
like me from abducting him...

355
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,430
...did he stay behind
in his fort all along?

356
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,788
Muktamba is on a poetic spree

357
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:32,009
I am his sister

358
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:35,324
And I hardly see him, except
during festivals or special events

359
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:37,269
(overlap of voices)

360
00:29:37,294 --> 00:29:39,675
Where on earth are the guards?

361
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,725
When girls fall all over him...

362
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:47,159
...isn't it their duty
to restrain them?

363
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:49,349
Are you angry about them
falling all over him?

364
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:52,361
Or sad you are unable to?!

365
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:54,229
Did you notice this, chief minister?

366
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:57,758
Look at the attention he is
receiving from all the girls here?

367
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:01,148
We must fix the perfect
alliance for him at once

368
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:04,376
Otherwise like the 'gopikas'
drawn to Lord Krisna...

369
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:07,017
...how many girls will
flock towards our prince?

370
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:10,287
Wonder how many zenanas
we may have to build

371
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,995
Prince of Kakatiya kingdom Rudradeva

372
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:21,178
Long live!

373
00:34:21,304 --> 00:34:22,994
The curiosity of
Rudradeva's whereabouts

374
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,745
And his enigmatic appearance
to be considered on one hand

375
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:29,221
After my grandfather
King Singhana died...

376
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:32,304
...my brother Krishna Bhupathi ascended
the throne on the other hand

377
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:35,126
We were forced to
play a waiting game

378
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,625
We cannot wait any longer

379
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:42,133
First we should ride rough shod
over our enemy using our intelligence

380
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:47,844
Rising from the highlands of Devagiri...

381
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:53,006
...the rivers Krishna, Godavari,
Manjira flowing into Orugallu land

382
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:55,222
...are our new weapons

383
00:34:56,144 --> 00:35:01,405
Stop the rivers that serve as life source
flowing into the Kakatiya kingdom

384
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:03,599
Build dams

385
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:08,379
Sacrifice those who restrain
your efforts to the Goddess of that dam

386
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,346
Without water, instead
of falling at our feet...

387
00:35:12,423 --> 00:35:15,457
...will the Kakatiyas die hiccupping?

388
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,936
Wait and watch

389
00:35:18,064 --> 00:35:20,061
With just the wave of my hand...

390
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:27,260
...how I, Mahadeva, will reduce
the Kakatiyas to tears

391
00:38:33,164 --> 00:38:35,660
Without even a drop of water
we are facing severe drought

392
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:38,603
We are suffering without water
to drink or even 1 square meal a day

393
00:38:38,688 --> 00:38:41,107
It's better to die in war
than in this gnawing hunger

394
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,734
We are ready to die

395
00:38:42,963 --> 00:38:44,806
Why are you retreating, prince?

396
00:38:46,202 --> 00:38:47,546
We will fight!

397
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:49,658
But not to die

398
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,830
To make our next generation live

399
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:54,303
Afflicting our lands with
drought, hunger and thirst...

400
00:38:54,328 --> 00:38:57,246
...Mahadev of Devagiri has
stopped the flow of the rivers

401
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,843
He can stop the rivers

402
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,548
But can he stop
the rain by fencing it?

403
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:03,887
Will raindrops not fall?

404
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:06,178
Won't leaves sprout?
Will our land not be lush green?

405
00:39:07,282 --> 00:39:09,202
Rain water is enough for us

406
00:39:09,707 --> 00:39:11,781
We will store rain water in reservoirs

407
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:14,532
To save rain water
as per Kakatiya lineage...

408
00:39:14,846 --> 00:39:16,651
...in the name of King Ganapati Deva

409
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,891
'Ganapa Samudram'

410
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,260
In the name of the king's sisters

411
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,058
'Paiyamba Sagaram'
and 'Raja Samudram'

412
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:23,965
'Rudra Samudram'
in the name of our prince

413
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:26,177
The task of building
reservoirs has begun

414
00:39:26,418 --> 00:39:28,031
We are dying of thirst here

415
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:30,212
And you claim digging a well
will provide us water

416
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:33,033
That is the reason
we are organizing...

417
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,201
...canals to be dug
and channelized

418
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:40,759
Water will be provided
for agriculture

419
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:43,226
Until this water scarcity is solved
we abolish all taxes

420
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:47,614
Until we are able to
stand on our own feet...

421
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,935
...we have no time
to think of war

422
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,914
After that, the battlefield
is never too far

423
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:54,475
Only if you live that long!

424
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:57,039
Don't dig lakes
Dig your own grave first

425
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:57,832
Not just water

426
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:00,560
Our king Mahadeva will
destroy every blade of grass

427
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:02,888
Long live
King Mahadeva!

428
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:06,699
Mahadeva's men have
sneaked into our land

429
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:24,661
You dare stop our water?

430
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:28,579
We will gather the blood of
your Devagiri conspirators...

431
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:32,202
...we will wash our hands
in our Kakatiya waters

432
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,842
Even if a hundred Mahadevas arise...

433
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:38,408
...one prince Rudradeva will do
to destroy injustice

434
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:48,065
Long live Rudradeva
Prince of Kakatiya!

435
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,848
(cheering continues)

436
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,129
Well done, Rudradeva

437
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:12,095
For a valiant man like you...

438
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:14,552
...laying siege once is not enough

439
00:42:15,143 --> 00:42:18,407
Let many obstacles
befall you because of me

440
00:42:19,322 --> 00:42:24,045
Only then will the taste buds of
our enmity enjoy the flavor

441
00:42:26,353 --> 00:42:29,271
Soldiers of Devagiri entered
our city yesterday

442
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:32,752
How do we know Mahadeva
won't attack our fort tomorrow?

443
00:42:33,966 --> 00:42:36,884
Orugallu that stands
without protection...

444
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:40,203
...even God cannot save!

445
00:42:40,228 --> 00:42:45,681
True, even God cannot save
our land that lacks protection

446
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:04,009
King Ganapati Deva,
my father's wonderful dream...

447
00:43:04,034 --> 00:43:07,951
...was to fortify and strengthen
the Kakatiya defenses

448
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:10,615
He wanted to build
7 walls around our fort

449
00:43:10,804 --> 00:43:15,514
Let us start to complete
the 7 walls to our fort now

450
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:16,564
'The son who excels his father'

451
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:18,394
You are a fine example
of this, Rudradeva

452
00:43:19,184 --> 00:43:20,221
Armor for the warrior

453
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,865
Fortified walls for the kingdom

454
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:24,171
Your deed will be etched in history

455
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:26,643
This will not find
a place in history

456
00:43:26,882 --> 00:43:31,144
The king himself was unable to
finish building the walls of our fort

457
00:43:32,707 --> 00:43:37,046
Wonder why our prince is in haste
or what spurns his anger?

458
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:41,025
Is all this even possible, prince?

459
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:44,457
When ambition is strength and
hard work is in each breath...

460
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,172
...'impossible' does not even exist

461
00:43:46,628 --> 00:43:50,007
Walls made of stone, gravel,
sand, iron, thorn...

462
00:43:50,032 --> 00:43:52,413
Shell lime and sand plaster
And finally bamboo

463
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:56,853
Finish building these 7 walls
with immediate effect

464
00:43:57,209 --> 00:43:58,591
Your wish is our command

465
00:43:59,217 --> 00:43:59,908
Hit hard

466
00:44:00,525 --> 00:44:01,792
Heave-ho!

467
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:03,377
Strike it strong

468
00:44:03,402 --> 00:44:04,439
Heave-ho

469
00:44:04,464 --> 00:44:06,230
Pull with force
Heave-ho!

470
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:08,013
Speed up
Heave ho!

471
00:44:08,465 --> 00:44:10,270
Dig deep
Heave ho!

472
00:44:12,635 --> 00:44:14,555
To raise funds to
build the 7 walls...

473
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,420
...there are 2 special features
in this festive event

474
00:44:18,914 --> 00:44:20,565
Whoever scales up
this bronze pillar...

475
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,809
...that represents the magnificence
of our Kakatiya dynasty

476
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:26,637
...will be awarded the title,
'Brave heart, bravest of the brave'

477
00:44:28,294 --> 00:44:29,331
The second feature

478
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:33,185
Gona Varada Reddy,
son of Lakkumaiah Reddy...

479
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:37,244
...and Anamika Devi, daughter of
Yelikikona Reddy of Adavoni

480
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:39,252
...will be united in matrimony
graced by his Majesty

481
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:40,775
Not just 2 hearts

482
00:44:40,851 --> 00:44:43,654
2 kingdoms will merge
to become one

483
00:44:45,051 --> 00:44:48,545
We offer our wedding gifts
as a royal fund

484
00:44:48,825 --> 00:44:50,361
Bravo! Lakkumaiah Reddy!

485
00:44:50,808 --> 00:44:52,843
Instead of contributing
from your treasury...

486
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:54,411
...you burden the people

487
00:44:54,635 --> 00:44:56,632
God's will that will end well

488
00:44:57,574 --> 00:44:59,225
Let the contest for
the Brave heart begin

489
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:01,171
I wish the same too

490
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:04,515
First is the contest
Only then the wedding

491
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,450
After the wedding,
we get the real gold

492
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,961
Fake gold for the treasury

493
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,961
Son Varada, even if you eat mud
this title is only for you

494
00:45:42,215 --> 00:45:43,405
Let the contest begin

495
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,428
Come

496
00:45:44,684 --> 00:45:48,140
I am your husband
No matter what!

497
00:45:51,761 --> 00:45:52,759
Come, dear

498
00:45:59,402 --> 00:46:03,780
Is there no brave man in the entire
Kakatiya kingdom to scale this pillar?

499
00:47:52,313 --> 00:47:54,540
Bravest of the brave
in Kakatiya land

500
00:47:54,565 --> 00:47:55,487
Long live Brave heart!

501
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:58,524
Praise be to the bravest of
the brave in Kakatiya land

502
00:48:00,174 --> 00:48:01,595
Amazing

503
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:05,579
Warrior, your feat is unparalleled

504
00:48:05,604 --> 00:48:06,718
Who may you be?

505
00:48:06,891 --> 00:48:09,195
State your name
and your origin

506
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,372
And claim your award

507
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:16,082
Not answering is equal to
disrespecting the king

508
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:19,684
We give you another chance
because you are the winner

509
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,728
Answer!
Who are you?

510
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,531
kOtai Sandiveera

511
00:48:36,866 --> 00:48:41,282
(cheering)

512
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:56,361
(cheering continues)

513
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:24,563
'The way you swirl your sword...'

514
00:49:24,776 --> 00:49:27,771
'...looks like you will be my only rival
in this kingdom, Ganna Reddy'

515
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:29,732
'Gona Ganna Reddy!'

516
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:34,151
Like his father and my brother
Gona Buddha Reddy...

517
00:49:34,189 --> 00:49:37,376
...I thought Gona Ganna Reddy
would be an ally of the Kakatiyas

518
00:49:37,795 --> 00:49:39,842
But he is getting ready
to oppose us

519
00:49:39,867 --> 00:49:43,438
He changes into a robber and grabs
the riches and lives of minor chieftains

520
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,285
Yes, indeed

521
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:56,147
kOtai Sandiveera

522
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:03,427
A lot of people
seem to know about me

523
00:50:04,695 --> 00:50:10,109
Many who have seen me
face to face are no longer alive

524
00:50:11,015 --> 00:50:14,343
Long live Brave heart!

525
00:50:14,837 --> 00:50:16,634
Be quiet

526
00:50:20,326 --> 00:50:22,279
Scaling this pillar,
scratching your back

527
00:50:22,304 --> 00:50:23,763
Stamping mud

528
00:50:24,217 --> 00:50:25,907
Do you call these a challenge?

529
00:50:26,378 --> 00:50:29,143
Amulet on my hip thread!

530
00:50:29,303 --> 00:50:33,988
Can't one who is equipped to
milk a tiger do the same to a cow?

531
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:36,003
Tell us straight to our face

532
00:50:36,191 --> 00:50:37,228
Why did you come here?

533
00:50:37,253 --> 00:50:38,482
I will tell you

534
00:50:39,387 --> 00:50:43,112
My father's brother betrayed
my father and killed him

535
00:50:44,953 --> 00:50:46,105
I let him live

536
00:50:46,192 --> 00:50:48,381
The king who was
supposed to protect...

537
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:49,825
...failed in his duties

538
00:50:50,394 --> 00:50:51,776
I ignored that as well

539
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:56,348
They branded me as a robber
because I fought for the poor

540
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:59,205
I let that go as well

541
00:50:59,777 --> 00:51:02,503
If injustice happens to me,
I will not shed a tear

542
00:51:02,795 --> 00:51:04,715
But if I see it happen
in front of me...

543
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,314
...I will not let it go!

544
00:51:08,457 --> 00:51:13,257
A girl is being coerced into marrying
the prince in front of the king?

545
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,917
It will not happen!

546
00:51:15,103 --> 00:51:16,754
Gona Ganna Reddy!

547
00:51:17,412 --> 00:51:19,294
What is it, Varada?

548
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:20,893
My wicked cousin

549
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:25,596
Like a jasmine stuck to
the mouth of a lizard...

550
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:28,133
...why do you want this wedding?

551
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,499
Why do you keep
falling from this pillar?

552
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:34,280
Amulet on my hip thread!

553
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:38,169
If you are half baked
in everything like this...

554
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,747
...you cannot even father a goat-kid!

555
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:43,412
You half baked warrior!

556
00:51:43,612 --> 00:51:45,263
A half baked warrior
is still a warrior!

557
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:47,833
My son-in-law went half way up
That is enough for me

558
00:51:48,884 --> 00:51:50,390
He will please even his wife only halfway

559
00:51:50,415 --> 00:51:51,995
Is that enough too?

560
00:51:53,073 --> 00:51:56,564
Prince, Gona Ganna Reddy is now
interested in my daughter Anamika

561
00:51:56,843 --> 00:51:58,494
He has come here
to abduct her now

562
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:02,452
Not only Anamika
but also the throne of Kakatiya

563
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:06,239
Shut up, Hari Hara Deva

564
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:11,065
Eligibility for a king
is not just having an heir

565
00:52:11,522 --> 00:52:13,173
But to be a brave warrior!

566
00:52:13,314 --> 00:52:16,885
Has no one ever told you
the throne is for the courageous

567
00:52:17,328 --> 00:52:20,438
- Ganna Reddy!
- Gona Ganna Reddy!!

568
00:52:20,622 --> 00:52:21,620
Yes, of course

569
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,115
Robber Sandiveera

570
00:52:24,399 --> 00:52:26,549
Opposing the king
is an unpardonable crime

571
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,271
Why would you not say so?

572
00:52:28,347 --> 00:52:30,881
How would you know the difference
between right and wrong?

573
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:35,812
For you to step out of the fortress,
an elephant must get mad and trumpet!

574
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:39,412
Every chieftain here
is a mad elephant

575
00:52:39,437 --> 00:52:41,242
They trample the people

576
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:43,653
Even if you turn a blind eye
to these mad elephants...

577
00:52:43,772 --> 00:52:45,001
...I refuse to do so

578
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,857
- What arrogance!
- Forgive me

579
00:52:48,149 --> 00:52:49,723
My body is full of arrogance

580
00:52:49,748 --> 00:52:51,745
Are you playing with words?

581
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:54,123
I am a hunter who
knows how to play

582
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:56,257
The hunt is ours

583
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,534
Prasad Aditya

584
00:52:58,954 --> 00:53:00,989
Soldiers
Surround him

585
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,949
'We'll protect our brother'

586
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,917
My lovely little lion cubs

587
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:42,211
You threaten these people
with your tiny catapults!

588
00:53:42,236 --> 00:53:43,081
Bravo!

589
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:46,584
We won't show any concession
for you as children, move back

590
00:53:50,591 --> 00:53:53,778
Admirable indeed!
Your love and concern

591
00:53:54,084 --> 00:53:56,555
My dear cubs, I will manage

592
00:53:56,838 --> 00:53:57,578
Run along

593
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:02,785
'We are retreating only because
our brother says so!'

594
00:54:02,913 --> 00:54:05,601
'We will even give up
our lives for our brother'

595
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:07,473
Gona Ganna Reddy

596
00:54:07,816 --> 00:54:11,464
You were right, I am not
interested in this royal alliance

597
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:14,797
But Varada Reddy
is a half baked warrior

598
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:16,550
He won't let you take me away

599
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:19,484
If you are brave,
then defeat him

600
00:54:19,732 --> 00:54:21,806
Then I will come with you
of my own accord

601
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:24,219
Your wish is my command, prince

602
00:54:24,314 --> 00:54:26,887
Today is my wedding day
and the day of his death

603
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,978
Both by my hand only

604
00:54:29,003 --> 00:54:32,920
I have been waiting
to kill him for so long

605
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,243
Anamika, get ready

606
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:06,562
Brave men, encircle Ganna Reddy!

607
00:55:14,546 --> 00:55:18,156
We couldn't handle Gona Ganna Reddy
when he was standing face to face

608
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,947
How can we nab him now?

609
00:55:20,143 --> 00:55:22,255
You must save
my son somehow

610
00:55:23,535 --> 00:55:27,245
The only brave and fearless man
who can oppose Gona Ganna Reddy...

611
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,574
...is my dear friend
Veerabhadra Chalukya

612
00:55:52,361 --> 00:55:55,126
Where is your leader,
the looter Sandiveera?

613
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:57,916
I have dedicated my life
to kOtai Sandiveera

614
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,021
I will not tell

615
00:55:59,141 --> 00:56:00,063
Kill me

616
00:56:04,037 --> 00:56:06,187
You killed the chieftains

617
00:56:09,444 --> 00:56:12,132
Gona Ganna Reddy,
you are not a human

618
00:56:12,283 --> 00:56:13,857
You are a savage beast

619
00:56:14,797 --> 00:56:17,869
But you will not escape
from my clutches

620
00:56:23,117 --> 00:56:25,997
I must kill
Gona Ganna Reddy

621
00:56:26,608 --> 00:56:29,181
In order to kill him
first you must be alive

622
00:56:30,478 --> 00:56:31,976
Gona Ganna Reddy!

623
00:56:32,168 --> 00:56:35,202
I am going back
to save Varada Reddy

624
00:56:35,852 --> 00:56:37,772
Do not assume
the hunt is over

625
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,169
It has only just begun

626
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:43,384
Without discerning the gender...

627
00:56:43,964 --> 00:56:46,612
...we can be carefree and
get intoxicated with ambrosia

628
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:51,133
This Kaumudi festival is ours

629
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:54,614
We can unlock the secret desires
from the chambers of our heart

630
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:57,944
Gona Ganna Reddy is
extremely handsome

631
00:56:58,403 --> 00:57:01,053
Warrior who is
the bravest of the brave

632
00:57:01,347 --> 00:57:03,689
He came to save me

633
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:06,208
But most unnecessarily...

634
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:09,648
...he carried away Varada Reddy

635
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,877
For our enemies, Rudradeva
is like a wild elephant

636
00:57:13,164 --> 00:57:16,044
Only for teenage girls
he is the God of love

637
00:57:16,268 --> 00:57:18,495
To marry the prince...

638
00:57:18,675 --> 00:57:21,862
...is the dream of all the princesses
of the neighboring lands

639
00:57:22,742 --> 00:57:23,625
Of course

640
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,146
Wonder how many will compete

641
00:57:26,427 --> 00:57:28,846
Wonder how many cat-fights
will be waged!

642
00:57:28,871 --> 00:57:31,021
Victory or heavenly abode?!

643
00:57:31,842 --> 00:57:33,532
We should wage a war for him

644
00:57:55,054 --> 00:58:01,160
'This Kaumudi festival is
not to indulge in idle chat'

645
00:58:01,986 --> 00:58:06,517
'To let all our secret wishes
embedded in our hearts to fly free'

646
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:08,487
'If we miss this opportunity...'

647
00:58:08,512 --> 00:58:12,851
'...this happiness cannot be
experienced for another year'

648
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:52,073
She is more beautiful
than the milky moon

649
00:58:52,284 --> 00:58:53,974
Who is this heavenly damsel?

650
00:58:59,676 --> 00:59:04,860
"Full moon flower
Play with us forever"

651
00:59:05,523 --> 00:59:10,562
"Bathed in silver light
let's share stories all night"

652
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:16,627
"From the palace, a koel solitary
along with her brood voluntary"

653
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:22,085
"Her youth springing, from her prison
she winged to fly to a new horizon"

654
00:59:22,455 --> 00:59:28,100
"Is she reading this youthful hymn
in the still of the night in the garden?"

655
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:33,920
"Full moon flower
Play with us forever"

656
00:59:34,515 --> 00:59:40,659
"Bathed in silvery light
let's share stories all night"

657
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:47,882
Who is this enchanting enchantress?

658
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,998
She gives a new meaning to beauty

659
01:00:15,553 --> 01:00:20,967
"Clouds tease a dulcet display
of fresh raindrops at play"

660
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:26,173
"Waves orchestrate a rhapsody
Waving and weaving melody"

661
01:00:26,896 --> 01:00:32,464
"Is this the veena strumming
in silence a sweet soft humming?"

662
01:00:32,914 --> 01:00:38,290
"Where is the scent of the soul
which abducted my heart whole?"

663
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:42,232
"Is it the chilly air tingling
from the dewy waterfall singing?"

664
01:00:42,257 --> 01:00:44,945
"Is it the climbing creeper
bearing the jasmine flower?"

665
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,543
"Is it the flute that plays
lilting music always?"

666
01:00:48,092 --> 01:00:50,703
"Is it the waves of joy filling
the heart with a blissful feeling?"

667
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:53,165
"I am not 'me' now really"

668
01:00:53,376 --> 01:00:56,294
"A poetry crossing the boundary"

669
01:00:56,707 --> 01:01:01,968
"Full moon flower
Play with us forever"

670
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:07,337
"Bathed in silver light
let's share stories all night"

671
01:01:07,933 --> 01:01:13,347
"Full moon flower
Play with us forever"

672
01:01:14,456 --> 01:01:19,947
"Bathed in milky white moon light
let's share stories all night"

673
01:01:22,384 --> 01:01:25,840
'There is no other girl
as beautiful on this earth'

674
01:01:31,658 --> 01:01:35,076
'My dear friend...!'

675
01:01:50,516 --> 01:01:54,625
Such a beautiful girl
cannot exist on earth

676
01:01:58,736 --> 01:01:59,619
Friend?

677
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:03,900
It is true

678
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,016
This statue has life
and is bathing in the river

679
01:02:10,591 --> 01:02:12,741
The petite waist of Rati,
the consort of God of love

680
01:02:12,766 --> 01:02:14,955
The alluring curves of
Rambha the celestial nymph

681
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,708
Lips as red as they can get

682
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:18,791
Urvasi's features

683
01:02:19,046 --> 01:02:20,724
Menaka's graceful form

684
01:02:20,749 --> 01:02:22,669
Tilotamma's divine face

685
01:02:26,522 --> 01:02:27,520
Who are you?

686
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,186
Which 'swayamvara' should
I win to make you my wife?

687
01:02:30,487 --> 01:02:32,177
Which kingdom should I capture?

688
01:02:35,654 --> 01:02:38,325
Oh! It is customary to
first introduce myself

689
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:40,116
I am Veerabhadra
of the Chalukya dynasty

690
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,547
I hail from Nidavartyapuram

691
01:02:41,711 --> 01:02:42,709
For further details...

692
01:02:42,734 --> 01:02:45,422
...shall I ask your prince Rudradeva
to speak on my behalf?

693
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:47,031
Are you in such a hurry?

694
01:02:47,056 --> 01:02:48,822
I will ask the same Kakatiya prince...

695
01:02:49,018 --> 01:02:52,128
...to snip the tail of temerity
of youngsters like you

696
01:02:58,995 --> 01:03:00,723
Jaganmohini the enchantress

697
01:03:00,748 --> 01:03:02,169
Wherever you may hide...

698
01:03:02,353 --> 01:03:05,540
...you cannot escape
from my clutches

699
01:05:08,997 --> 01:05:16,677
We thought king Ganapati Deva needed
7 births to build 7 walls of the forts

700
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:19,604
But in just 7 months...

701
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:23,238
...2nd wall has been built
and the 3rd is also ready

702
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,056
Your Majesty!

703
01:05:25,398 --> 01:05:29,084
Wherever they are digging
to build the walls of the fort...

704
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,324
...they are unearthing treasures

705
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:39,403
'With the help of
underground treasures...'

706
01:05:39,743 --> 01:05:42,930
'...the half-finished walls
of our fort will be completed'

707
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:45,437
'As an avatar of Goddess Shakti...'

708
01:05:45,462 --> 01:05:48,457
'...this kingdom will be
saved only by that baby girl'

709
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:54,825
When precious gems were unearthed
while building the 7 walls of the fort...

710
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:57,000
...whether really a girl
was born to the king

711
01:05:57,361 --> 01:05:59,819
...a seed of doubt sprouted in
the minds of the Deva brothers

712
01:05:59,844 --> 01:06:01,572
Who was the enchantress Nagadeva saw?

713
01:06:01,922 --> 01:06:04,149
Why is Rudradeva still unmarried?

714
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,564
Along with questions danger also arose

715
01:06:06,835 --> 01:06:08,717
Our prince to be married?

716
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:11,029
Why?

717
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:15,954
Is Rudradeva like Bhishma
a sworn bachelor?

718
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:18,841
Or is he not eligible
like Shikandi?

719
01:06:19,394 --> 01:06:20,386
This is not my question

720
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:22,858
Our people are indulging
in idle gossip

721
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:26,010
To stop these rumors...

722
01:06:26,035 --> 01:06:28,070
...this is the best opportunity

723
01:06:28,342 --> 01:06:29,801
My elder brother's opinion

724
01:06:29,973 --> 01:06:33,007
You have proved yourselves
to be partners

725
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,661
My mind is enthralled with
your care and concern for royalty

726
01:06:38,302 --> 01:06:43,678
Prince Rudradeva's wedding
has been finalized long ago

727
01:06:48,762 --> 01:06:53,101
Our prince will marry Muktamba
the daughter of Jayabasena

728
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,822
The wedding was fixed
in my presence long ago

729
01:06:57,336 --> 01:06:59,832
As well-meaning
relatives of the king...

730
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:02,869
...you should grace the occasion
and conduct the wedding

731
01:07:03,177 --> 01:07:05,481
Like a barren woman
blessing a pregnant lady...

732
01:07:05,702 --> 01:07:07,737
...should they oversee the wedding?

733
01:08:01,752 --> 01:08:04,056
Secret tunnel to
the ladies chambers

734
01:08:04,653 --> 01:08:07,763
The Kaumudi festival where
the enchantress appeared...

735
01:08:07,936 --> 01:08:10,893
...and this royal family are
linked in some special way

736
01:08:14,978 --> 01:08:18,012
- Uncle, I found it
- Found what?

737
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:21,152
An underground passage
to the zenana in the palace

738
01:08:21,256 --> 01:08:22,984
Is that so, Nagadeva?

739
01:08:23,288 --> 01:08:24,402
Where is that tunnel?

740
01:08:24,443 --> 01:08:26,632
Uncle, how eager you are

741
01:08:27,326 --> 01:08:28,977
I won't tell you

742
01:08:29,002 --> 01:08:32,458
Until I finish the job, you'll put me
on a pedestal calling me Chanakya

743
01:08:32,603 --> 01:08:35,560
Then you'll insult me
by calling me all sorts of names

744
01:08:39,423 --> 01:08:41,765
Okay, you don't have
to tell us the way

745
01:08:42,223 --> 01:08:44,105
But listen to me

746
01:08:45,152 --> 01:08:47,034
Go through that tunnel

747
01:08:47,674 --> 01:08:52,052
If you see the enchantress,
enjoy her as much as you please

748
01:08:52,744 --> 01:08:57,352
Kill Rudradeva before
he gets to the wedding stage

749
01:08:58,042 --> 01:09:00,576
We are the ones
organizing the wedding

750
01:09:00,912 --> 01:09:04,176
The entire marriage hall
is surrounded by our men

751
01:09:04,669 --> 01:09:07,664
Rudradeva is in your hands
in the zenana

752
01:09:08,197 --> 01:09:10,155
The wedding hall is in my hands

753
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:14,404
The entire royal family will be
wiped out including Ganapati Deva

754
01:09:15,127 --> 01:09:18,737
Hereafter I am the emperor
of the Kakatiya kingdom

755
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:20,476
Hari Hara Deva

756
01:09:29,745 --> 01:09:31,665
Princess, you're in such a rush?

757
01:09:31,808 --> 01:09:33,459
If I come early,
you say I rush

758
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,707
If I come late...

759
01:09:34,809 --> 01:09:38,150
...you say women take
all day and night to get ready

760
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,558
True

761
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:42,463
Women are not the reason
for the delay in getting dressed

762
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,068
Men are to be blamed

763
01:09:44,203 --> 01:09:46,085
Your friend himself
hasn't arrived as yet

764
01:09:46,552 --> 01:09:47,435
Then?

765
01:09:47,564 --> 01:09:50,367
If one must sit majestically
next to a beauty like me...

766
01:09:50,646 --> 01:09:54,448
...even a renowned prince must
take extra care in getting dressed

767
01:10:19,545 --> 01:10:21,119
My guess was right

768
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,826
My enchantress is here

769
01:10:23,196 --> 01:10:25,193
First I must send
the prince to hell

770
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:28,058
And then taste
a slice of heaven

771
01:10:30,379 --> 01:10:32,069
Prince, here I come

772
01:11:30,283 --> 01:11:31,589
So you are a woman?

773
01:11:31,614 --> 01:11:33,227
You got away
fooling everyone

774
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:37,860
You have enacted this play for 25 years
because women have no right to rule?

775
01:11:38,257 --> 01:11:41,867
If I kill you now
this secret will die with you

776
01:11:42,275 --> 01:11:44,579
But if the secret is
brought out in the open...

777
01:11:44,604 --> 01:11:47,714
...the entire Kakatiya kingdom will be ruined

778
01:11:57,752 --> 01:12:00,248
Prince Rudradeva
is not in the palace

779
01:12:00,951 --> 01:12:03,524
Veerabhadra, some danger
has befallen the prince

780
01:12:03,747 --> 01:12:04,976
Close all exits and entrances

781
01:12:05,001 --> 01:12:07,459
Warriors, send word
to Prasad Aditya

782
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:55,216
Priest...?

783
01:12:55,475 --> 01:12:58,585
If the auspicious time is nearing
tie the sacred thread to this sword

784
01:12:58,955 --> 01:13:01,566
This wedding must definitely
happen as planned

785
01:13:20,612 --> 01:13:22,916
Look! My brother is coming

786
01:13:26,742 --> 01:13:27,932
What happened, friend?

787
01:13:27,979 --> 01:13:29,976
Nothing, I came
by another way

788
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:36,740
He has a long lifeline

789
01:13:37,265 --> 01:13:40,183
He escaped from
Nagadeva's clutches

790
01:13:41,048 --> 01:13:44,197
(Holy chant)

791
01:14:02,677 --> 01:14:04,367
Don't lose heart, brother

792
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:08,836
The newly married couple
will go to the royal premises

793
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:11,276
In the name of
Gona Ganna Reddy...

794
01:14:11,732 --> 01:14:15,380
...the obstacle we have created
will be Rudradeva's death knell

795
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:21,538
Long live
Prince Rudradeva!

796
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,094
For your wedding,
the bandit Gona Ganna Reddy...

797
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:30,690
...has sent this toy elephant as a gift

798
01:14:33,878 --> 01:14:36,796
The target is ours
Blame is on Gona Ganna Reddy

799
01:14:36,937 --> 01:14:39,625
The royal family will be totally
destroyed thanks to him

800
01:14:39,703 --> 01:14:44,157
Long live
Brave heart!

801
01:14:49,729 --> 01:14:55,143
Long live
kOtai Sandiveera

802
01:15:22,857 --> 01:15:26,620
You thought I'd be far away
and not come here?

803
01:15:28,464 --> 01:15:31,114
I am like my mother tongue

804
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:35,362
I'll be here and everywhere

805
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:39,165
I would be the last person
on earth to hide and fight

806
01:15:39,246 --> 01:15:40,974
You lesser mortals
equal to my amulet!

807
01:15:41,184 --> 01:15:43,450
It is not in my blood
to be a coward

808
01:15:46,904 --> 01:15:49,515
My war is only with Rudradeva

809
01:15:49,705 --> 01:15:51,510
And only face to face

810
01:15:53,433 --> 01:15:55,391
An auspicious event
is happening here

811
01:15:55,619 --> 01:15:58,653
With only the scent of sandalwood
Not blood splashed all over

812
01:15:59,032 --> 01:16:01,758
That's why I am sparing you

813
01:16:02,575 --> 01:16:03,573
Go

814
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:10,644
If you use my name
in a wrong manner...

815
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,862
...I'll string your intestines
and garland the fortress walls

816
01:16:18,757 --> 01:16:21,407
Veerabhadra Chalukya,
if the crime must be exposed...

817
01:16:21,432 --> 01:16:24,466
...don't let Gona Ganna Reddy
cross the fortress walls

818
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:36,548
Go...go

819
01:18:23,873 --> 01:18:31,092
All the incarnates of God Shiva
and Goddess Shakti as witness

820
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:37,538
Let me tell you now

821
01:18:37,563 --> 01:18:39,559
Rudradeva, put this on record

822
01:18:43,248 --> 01:18:48,470
The sword I have sharpened will fly
in mid-air and target only you

823
01:18:58,312 --> 01:19:03,227
'Intermission'

824
01:19:03,761 --> 01:19:07,063
'It became evident to everyone
that danger lurked for prince Rudradeva...'

825
01:19:07,088 --> 01:19:11,005
'...and the Kakatiya throne
in the form of Gona Ganna Reddy'

826
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:14,486
'The sword that I have honed
will directly target...'

827
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:15,794
'...only you!'

828
01:19:15,819 --> 01:19:17,432
'In order to catch
that murderer-'

829
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:18,859
Gona Ganna Reddy!

830
01:19:19,072 --> 01:19:21,107
'Veerabhadra Chalukya
left no stone unturned'

831
01:19:21,255 --> 01:19:22,714
Come out if you have the courage

832
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:26,387
'To make the enemies believe
the might of the Kakatiya elephantry...'

833
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:30,672
'...the entire land's sugarcane yield
was heaped inside the fort'

834
01:19:30,781 --> 01:19:32,663
'To give the impression
of a strong army...'

835
01:19:32,688 --> 01:19:36,029
'...enormous piles of leaves serving
as plates were strewn outside the fort'

836
01:19:36,054 --> 01:19:38,989
'This was a clever ruse to dupe
the Devagiri spies by Shiva Devaiah'

837
01:19:39,226 --> 01:19:41,146
'Falling for this ploy,
the king of Devagiri...'

838
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:43,410
'...instead of direct combat'

839
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,603
'...looked for ways of
deceptive combat'

840
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:47,609
Hari Hara Murari Deva brothers

841
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:52,990
I revoke your powers till I know
your part in the Ganna Reddy conspiracy

842
01:19:57,126 --> 01:20:01,734
'Hari Hara Murari brothers
used a female as decoy'

843
01:20:02,107 --> 01:20:07,483
Madanika, Rudradeva
is strong in every aspect

844
01:20:08,493 --> 01:20:09,991
But only one weakness-

845
01:20:10,016 --> 01:20:11,859
Hidden in the zenana

846
01:20:12,383 --> 01:20:17,106
My lover Nagadeva died
in his quest to find out the truth

847
01:20:17,525 --> 01:20:19,829
Even if you wanted to
investigate personally...

848
01:20:20,114 --> 01:20:22,072
...after the attempted murder

849
01:20:22,388 --> 01:20:25,153
...you were barred from
entering the palace

850
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:29,256
As the dear friend of Muktamba
I'll secure a firm hold in the palace

851
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:31,780
And find out the secret

852
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,266
My dear prince...?

853
01:21:21,767 --> 01:21:25,377
You've come clad in your armor
even to the bedroom?

854
01:21:25,671 --> 01:21:28,104
Instead of tussling with kisses...

855
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:31,635
...does the prince indulge
in fighting with knives?

856
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,629
Muktamba

857
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:59,792
Forgive me for appearing like this
on such an auspicious night

858
01:22:02,463 --> 01:22:06,610
I have taken a righteous vow
for the welfare of the people

859
01:22:08,602 --> 01:22:11,674
Till it is fulfilled,
I cannot touch a girl

860
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:17,439
As my wife if you agree
I will continue with my vow

861
01:22:18,373 --> 01:22:19,755
If you don't approve-

862
01:22:19,811 --> 01:22:21,616
How can you even ask me?

863
01:22:22,895 --> 01:22:24,585
I am born for you

864
01:22:25,248 --> 01:22:26,707
Will I ever say no?

865
01:22:28,155 --> 01:22:30,421
Until your vow is fulfilled...

866
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:33,811
...I accept this abstinence gladly

867
01:22:59,059 --> 01:23:01,517
'Even if Rudradeva got
a reprieve on the personal front...'

868
01:23:01,613 --> 01:23:03,648
'...he had to face
a danger of a different kind'

869
01:23:03,847 --> 01:23:07,034
'He brandished his sword bravely
and entered the battlefield'

870
01:23:07,312 --> 01:23:10,806
'Victorious, he occupied
Vengi and Rajamahendravaram'

871
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:16,439
'King Veeraganda Gopala and Kalinga king
Narasimha-I were overpowered'

872
01:23:16,962 --> 01:23:21,455
'Telugu kingdom was saved from being
annexed by the neighboring lands'

873
01:23:21,882 --> 01:23:25,722
'This victory was inscribed in the temples
of Draksharama and Bheemeshwaram'

874
01:23:26,275 --> 01:23:28,541
I swear on Godavari river

875
01:23:28,957 --> 01:23:32,912
If my people suffer
I will not spare your lives

876
01:25:43,559 --> 01:25:45,709
'Our spy sacrificed
his life for this cause'

877
01:25:45,789 --> 01:25:51,242
'But Madanika will find out
the Kakatiya secret before she dies'

878
01:25:52,072 --> 01:25:53,915
Bravo Madanika!

879
01:25:54,198 --> 01:25:55,619
Well done

880
01:25:56,267 --> 01:25:58,648
You've proved you are
a true Devagiri girl

881
01:25:58,981 --> 01:26:01,362
I will capture
the Kakatiya army

882
01:26:01,604 --> 01:26:04,023
And I will chop Rudradeva's head

883
01:26:05,098 --> 01:26:07,632
The day to parade
his severed head...

884
01:26:08,785 --> 01:26:10,551
...is not too far away

885
01:36:10,174 --> 01:36:11,979
You are caught now
Gona Ganna Reddy

886
01:36:12,004 --> 01:36:14,385
I will arrest you
and put you behind bars

887
01:36:15,809 --> 01:36:19,342
Men put their swords back
in their sheaths when they see me

888
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:22,696
But a man hasn't been born
as yet to imprison me

889
01:36:44,434 --> 01:36:48,735
I'm not Abhimanyu to get
caught in the 'Padmavyuha'

890
01:36:50,146 --> 01:36:54,293
I am like Lord Krisna
The father of 'Chakravyuha'

891
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:00,696
Will you die?

892
01:37:01,262 --> 01:37:02,568
Or will you join me?

893
01:37:02,669 --> 01:37:04,704
Long live Brave heart
kOtai Sandiveera

894
01:37:05,009 --> 01:37:08,465
'kOtai Sandiveera
accumulated numerous allies'

895
01:37:08,931 --> 01:37:12,195
'Kotagiri kings in the west
Muthukur kings in the south'

896
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:16,855
'The Naganoors in the north
to the Kalingas in the east'

897
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,491
'He reigned supreme
with his death chapter'

898
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:23,706
'While everyone was progressing
towards their respective goals...'

899
01:38:23,958 --> 01:38:27,376
'...Madanika started unearthing
the secrets of the palace one by one'

900
01:38:27,755 --> 01:38:30,405
'She sent news to Devagiri
now and then also'

901
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:38,522
'The 7 walls were fortified
to prevent enemies'

902
01:39:00,687 --> 01:39:03,529
This is the correct figure
of the Kakatiya army?

903
01:39:03,773 --> 01:39:06,269
Till now canvassing
wrong figures...

904
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:09,285
...Shiva Devaiah deliberately
deceived all of us

905
01:39:09,633 --> 01:39:11,899
This news is enough
for me to raze...

906
01:39:12,024 --> 01:39:14,635
...the 7 walls of the fort to the ground

907
01:39:15,085 --> 01:39:16,352
Rudradeva!

908
01:39:16,377 --> 01:39:18,412
Your fort is mine

909
01:39:18,567 --> 01:39:20,871
And also the Kakatiya crown!

910
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:28,341
I fulfilled my promise

911
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:30,852
The girl who asked for it...?

912
01:39:31,167 --> 01:39:33,586
It's almost the end of January

913
01:39:35,412 --> 01:39:38,369
You neighed just like this
when she came here last

914
01:39:40,648 --> 01:39:42,568
Friend...you've come alone

915
01:39:42,796 --> 01:39:43,871
Where are your guards?

916
01:39:44,063 --> 01:39:46,751
Everyone says you've fallen
in love and become a lunatic

917
01:39:46,983 --> 01:39:49,556
I came alone to find out
how true the rumor is

918
01:39:49,839 --> 01:39:53,065
You are happily married to
Muktamba, my dear friend

919
01:39:53,372 --> 01:39:56,214
But I am all alone in solitude

920
01:39:56,625 --> 01:39:58,161
You've come
at the right time

921
01:39:58,286 --> 01:39:59,400
My beloved will come now

922
01:39:59,425 --> 01:40:02,280
You must get her family to consent
and conduct our wedding

923
01:40:02,691 --> 01:40:05,763
If I should do that,
you must win a challenge

924
01:40:06,256 --> 01:40:08,214
Even though you are
head over heels in love...

925
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:10,735
...prove you haven't forgotten
to cross swords

926
01:40:11,264 --> 01:40:13,568
The loser must heed
the winner's words

927
01:40:13,867 --> 01:40:17,093
I'll win my love's hand
by defeating you

928
01:41:15,368 --> 01:41:18,478
Rudradeva, look at Muktamba once

929
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:24,551
If she continues this vow,
the physician says it may kill her

930
01:41:31,975 --> 01:41:35,316
(Holy chant)

931
01:41:58,090 --> 01:42:00,279
Wearing this armor
is a weary load

932
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:02,328
I have to remove it

933
01:42:02,668 --> 01:42:04,588
Will you help me?

934
01:42:05,463 --> 01:42:07,690
Even the plants here
will have eyes

935
01:42:08,225 --> 01:42:11,796
If you remove it, won't your
life's secret be known to all?

936
01:42:17,799 --> 01:42:18,989
That means...

937
01:42:20,216 --> 01:42:22,098
...you know my secret?

938
01:42:27,511 --> 01:42:28,625
How?

939
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:31,136
When?

940
01:42:31,594 --> 01:42:33,284
On the day of the engagement

941
01:42:48,093 --> 01:42:52,202
Won't a girl recognize
another girl's first touch?

942
01:42:54,839 --> 01:42:56,682
You knew before the wedding?

943
01:42:58,949 --> 01:43:00,178
And still-

944
01:43:00,664 --> 01:43:02,622
Why did you bow your head
and marry me?

945
01:43:02,811 --> 01:43:04,923
For you to walk with
your head held high

946
01:43:05,192 --> 01:43:07,534
I let you tie this
protection thread

947
01:43:10,472 --> 01:43:13,352
I don't think of this
as a big sacrifice

948
01:43:14,624 --> 01:43:16,582
You are the epitome of sacrifice

949
01:43:17,836 --> 01:43:21,484
You don't bear the weight
of your armor alone

950
01:43:23,290 --> 01:43:25,133
But the burden of this kingdom

951
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,803
I did not save only you

952
01:43:29,633 --> 01:43:31,668
But millions of people too

953
01:43:32,143 --> 01:43:34,293
You have understood
my plight so well

954
01:43:35,499 --> 01:43:38,609
I bow my head
to your good heart

955
01:43:42,087 --> 01:43:45,927
From this moment,
I accept you as my daughter

956
01:43:50,228 --> 01:43:54,030
I'll also get you married
so that your life is not ruined

957
01:43:55,957 --> 01:43:58,107
An ideal match from
the Chalukya clan...

958
01:44:00,142 --> 01:44:02,062
...will be your perfect spouse

959
01:44:02,984 --> 01:44:04,405
My wedding is not priority

960
01:44:04,664 --> 01:44:08,197
When do you intend
marrying Veerabhadra?

961
01:44:22,717 --> 01:44:24,599
This birth is for my people

962
01:44:25,476 --> 01:44:27,204
My next birth is for you

963
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,094
Poignant philosophical lines

964
01:44:31,179 --> 01:44:33,675
Touch your heart and tell me
you don't love me

965
01:44:42,946 --> 01:44:45,941
Why do you betray yourself
by not having the guts to answer?

966
01:44:47,903 --> 01:44:50,437
More than your life and
your personal desires...

967
01:44:50,704 --> 01:44:53,930
...more than our friendship and our love
when the people matter more to you

968
01:44:54,169 --> 01:44:56,972
...I can't bury my love within me
and still stay with you

969
01:44:57,185 --> 01:44:58,299
Goodbye

970
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:15,708
I am not destined to
be married in this life

971
01:45:18,431 --> 01:45:20,543
I will remain
as Rudradeva always

972
01:45:26,208 --> 01:45:30,893
For the people of Kakatiya,
you sacrifice your comforts

973
01:45:31,874 --> 01:45:36,098
To meet face to face
such a noble woman

974
01:45:37,429 --> 01:45:39,387
And to serve her

975
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:41,359
I am indeed blessed

976
01:45:44,627 --> 01:45:46,624
Don't worry about me

977
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,818
Focus on your duty

978
01:46:12,507 --> 01:46:17,115
The man who ensures the people
of Kakatiya hear and sleep soundly

979
01:46:17,527 --> 01:46:24,401
The man whose name makes
men like you wake up quaking in fear

980
01:46:25,285 --> 01:46:29,125
That man
Rudradeva...

981
01:46:31,601 --> 01:46:33,444
...is not a male

982
01:46:34,482 --> 01:46:35,749
But a female

983
01:46:36,058 --> 01:46:37,632
Rudramadevi!

984
01:46:46,794 --> 01:46:48,560
25 years

985
01:46:50,083 --> 01:46:53,077
We've been taken for
a royal ride for 25 years!

986
01:46:53,102 --> 01:46:54,600
Ganapati Deva!

987
01:46:54,897 --> 01:46:58,775
Just watch how we expose
this tremendous secret

988
01:46:59,256 --> 01:47:01,752
For divulging such
earth shattering news...

989
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:04,955
...how do I, Madanika, get rewarded?

990
01:47:05,159 --> 01:47:08,385
Will you leave me with just
this gold jewelry I am wearing?

991
01:47:23,397 --> 01:47:27,851
We knew you were the spy
of Mahadeva rather belatedly

992
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:32,188
You must lean only to one side
even if you're a spy and courtesan

993
01:47:32,591 --> 01:47:36,969
If you play a double game
this will be your fate!

994
01:47:37,885 --> 01:47:41,802
This revelation is our most potent
weapon like the one created by Brahma

995
01:47:42,417 --> 01:47:44,299
Shiva Devaiah!

996
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:01,077
They have probably come
to pay their respects in person

997
01:48:01,117 --> 01:48:02,807
They are kith and kin after all

998
01:48:03,221 --> 01:48:07,829
King Ganapati Deva is about to proclaim
a revelation of vital importance

999
01:48:09,318 --> 01:48:10,585
Proclaim?

1000
01:48:11,719 --> 01:48:12,641
What?

1001
01:48:12,807 --> 01:48:14,689
Do you intend building
another new temple?

1002
01:48:14,874 --> 01:48:17,831
Color the fort walls?

1003
01:48:18,119 --> 01:48:20,653
Be silent and listen to the king

1004
01:48:22,178 --> 01:48:24,751
- Sure
- So be it

1005
01:48:25,939 --> 01:48:28,473
My dear subjects
and chieftains

1006
01:48:28,855 --> 01:48:31,236
Crowned as prince by me

1007
01:48:31,388 --> 01:48:33,423
And while seated in my assembly...

1008
01:48:33,614 --> 01:48:37,262
...he spread the glory of
Kakatiya reign in all 8 directions

1009
01:48:37,805 --> 01:48:42,144
I hereby announce the coronation
of prince Rudradeva as king

1010
01:48:42,586 --> 01:48:45,428
Long live, future king of
Kakatiya kingdom, Rudradeva!

1011
01:48:45,563 --> 01:48:48,712
Long live!

1012
01:48:49,073 --> 01:48:50,878
Long live!

1013
01:48:51,801 --> 01:48:53,567
What did I just hear you say?

1014
01:48:53,614 --> 01:48:56,302
Crowning ceremony for Rudradeva?

1015
01:48:58,083 --> 01:49:00,925
The prince will become the king?

1016
01:49:01,112 --> 01:49:03,485
Is that all or is there more?

1017
01:49:03,551 --> 01:49:05,586
Conform to the norms of
respecting the assembly

1018
01:49:05,611 --> 01:49:07,953
We will announce
what we intended to say

1019
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,893
Resppppect!

1020
01:49:11,485 --> 01:49:13,943
You be respectful first

1021
01:49:14,553 --> 01:49:18,173
Then there is plenty of respect
we have to show in return

1022
01:49:18,362 --> 01:49:21,593
The person you thought
was prince Rudradeva...

1023
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:23,651
...is not a male

1024
01:49:24,255 --> 01:49:25,292
But a female

1025
01:49:48,450 --> 01:49:51,023
Yes...by birth a girl

1026
01:49:51,349 --> 01:49:52,962
Rudramadevi

1027
01:50:14,072 --> 01:50:16,338
We announced a girl baby
to be a boy...

1028
01:50:16,566 --> 01:50:18,179
...for the welfare of the people

1029
01:50:18,283 --> 01:50:20,433
For our country's protection

1030
01:50:21,223 --> 01:50:24,986
For the Kakatiya reign
to prosper in the future

1031
01:50:25,645 --> 01:50:29,600
Rudramadevi was raised
as prince Rudradeva

1032
01:50:29,705 --> 01:50:32,278
And he regarded you
as his own children

1033
01:50:32,732 --> 01:50:36,073
Rudramadevi who made
Kakatiya period a golden one...

1034
01:50:36,228 --> 01:50:37,918
...on the full moon day in November

1035
01:50:38,095 --> 01:50:41,781
...we will express our gratitude
by crowning her as queen

1036
01:50:42,354 --> 01:50:44,850
With this, the court is dismissed

1037
01:50:47,538 --> 01:50:50,111
What was dismissed is not the court

1038
01:50:50,456 --> 01:50:52,606
But their royal bloodline

1039
01:50:56,262 --> 01:50:57,952
Rudradeva

1040
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:01,774
'Shiva Devaiah realized
the secret was exposed'

1041
01:51:02,147 --> 01:51:04,297
'So he himself divulged the secret'

1042
01:51:04,388 --> 01:51:06,846
'And played a shrewd
political game'

1043
01:51:07,205 --> 01:51:10,330
The wishes accumulated
for 25 long years...

1044
01:51:10,355 --> 01:51:12,477
...you foiled in just
1 second, Shiva Devaiah

1045
01:51:13,475 --> 01:51:15,817
Don't think this is over

1046
01:51:16,124 --> 01:51:18,582
Cleaning the house spic and span
does not conform a festival

1047
01:51:18,607 --> 01:51:20,873
A proclamation does not
constitute a coronation

1048
01:51:21,629 --> 01:51:24,163
We will show you
our skill and expertise

1049
01:51:45,282 --> 01:51:48,392
"In the zenana, a statue lo and behold"

1050
01:51:48,611 --> 01:51:51,107
"Eyes flashing desire multi-fold"

1051
01:51:51,764 --> 01:51:55,527
"A stage of youthfulness
Perfect and peerless"

1052
01:51:55,552 --> 01:51:58,624
"A peacock dancing gracefully
in a jungle joyously"

1053
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:01,506
"Bevy of roe deer aglow
fragrance bestow"

1054
01:52:01,607 --> 01:52:05,025
"Lands far and near
will laud your beauty, dear"

1055
01:52:05,182 --> 01:52:11,249
"At dusk under the jasmine bower,
a time to garland, capture the rapture"

1056
01:52:12,691 --> 01:52:19,255
"This beautiful damsel, zestful
enjoying life in its bounty plentiful"

1057
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:22,506
"Maiden like a swing beckoning
Unbidden, pulse quickening"

1058
01:52:22,896 --> 01:52:26,314
"A joy forever
in the ladies chamber"

1059
01:52:29,804 --> 01:52:34,258
"A peacock dancing gracefully
in a jungle joyously"

1060
01:53:10,806 --> 01:53:12,304
"Like a parasol of silver"

1061
01:53:12,687 --> 01:53:14,146
"From the cloud's veiled cover"

1062
01:53:14,178 --> 01:53:16,482
"The moon shines bright as ever"

1063
01:53:16,994 --> 01:53:19,413
"Like the breeze walks with the river"

1064
01:53:19,438 --> 01:53:21,051
"In the drizzle of dewy powder"

1065
01:53:21,076 --> 01:53:23,111
"At leisure
we will saunter"

1066
01:53:23,503 --> 01:53:27,765
"Crossing armies and boundaries
without any adversaries"

1067
01:53:27,790 --> 01:53:30,824
"Gently blows the cool breeze"

1068
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:37,377
"Lightning riding the blue skies
ruling breadth and lengthwise"

1069
01:53:37,971 --> 01:53:40,928
"What is the defending armor
for a girl's dream to flower?"

1070
01:53:41,561 --> 01:53:44,863
"In this heart and mind swing
a zillion swings breathtaking"

1071
01:53:44,888 --> 01:53:48,382
"When day and night
dance in delight"

1072
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:51,941
"In the zenana, a statue captivating"

1073
01:53:55,473 --> 01:53:59,351
"A peacock dancing
in a mood tempting"

1074
01:54:03,765 --> 01:54:06,607
(Holy chant)

1075
01:54:08,590 --> 01:54:11,124
We don't want
a lady to be our ruler

1076
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,731
Very well said indeed

1077
01:54:22,145 --> 01:54:24,487
For a woman to be seated...

1078
01:54:25,745 --> 01:54:27,511
...this is only the right place

1079
01:54:27,536 --> 01:54:29,187
Hey Ambadeva!

1080
01:54:29,589 --> 01:54:32,431
How dare you humiliate my own
daughter in front of my eyes?

1081
01:54:32,456 --> 01:54:33,378
I will-

1082
01:54:33,474 --> 01:54:35,010
Why trouble yourself, my king?

1083
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:36,895
One command from you

1084
01:54:37,056 --> 01:54:39,398
I will chop his head
and bring it to your feet

1085
01:54:39,423 --> 01:54:41,036
Prasad Aditya

1086
01:54:41,394 --> 01:54:44,773
Cut our heads too along
with Ambadeva's head then!

1087
01:54:45,113 --> 01:54:49,222
It's better to die than
be ruled by a woman

1088
01:54:52,206 --> 01:54:55,240
Because a woman didn't know
the place she should be in...

1089
01:54:55,265 --> 01:54:58,260
...don't we know how many
wars were initiated?

1090
01:54:58,915 --> 01:55:00,873
Like the war between
Lord Rama and Ravana...

1091
01:55:00,898 --> 01:55:02,549
...and the Kurukshetra war

1092
01:55:02,657 --> 01:55:03,924
...who was the reason?

1093
01:55:04,097 --> 01:55:05,518
A female, right?

1094
01:55:07,693 --> 01:55:10,919
Have we not seen kingdoms
fall because of women?

1095
01:55:11,155 --> 01:55:15,033
This land must not face
such a predicament again

1096
01:55:15,404 --> 01:55:16,825
We oppose

1097
01:55:16,967 --> 01:55:18,772
We don't want a woman in power!

1098
01:55:18,922 --> 01:55:21,610
We don't want

1099
01:55:22,184 --> 01:55:24,296
We object stron-

1100
01:55:24,439 --> 01:55:26,397
People of our Kakatiya kingdom

1101
01:55:26,668 --> 01:55:29,394
Stay calm
Silence!

1102
01:55:30,498 --> 01:55:32,610
Without the strength of
His consort Shakti...

1103
01:55:32,635 --> 01:55:34,401
...fearing He would
lose His mighty power

1104
01:55:36,394 --> 01:55:39,044
...even Lord Shiva shared
half His body to Goddess Shakti

1105
01:55:39,069 --> 01:55:42,677
To a woman who is considered
one half of Lord Shiva...

1106
01:55:44,109 --> 01:55:49,907
...what is wrong in
giving our throne?

1107
01:55:51,309 --> 01:55:52,423
Why?

1108
01:55:52,781 --> 01:55:54,778
In what way is
a woman inferior?

1109
01:55:56,199 --> 01:56:00,423
Not Sita, but Ravana was
the cause for the war against Lanka

1110
01:56:02,321 --> 01:56:06,468
It was the Kauravas and not Draupadi
who initiated the Kurukshetra war

1111
01:56:08,226 --> 01:56:11,413
Every man who disrespects a woman

1112
01:56:11,641 --> 01:56:13,753
Whoever he may be...

1113
01:56:14,217 --> 01:56:17,865
...he digs his own grave
to destruction!

1114
01:56:20,101 --> 01:56:23,058
Don't seal our lips with
anecdotes from the past

1115
01:56:23,182 --> 01:56:25,256
Even if we brush
old stories aside...

1116
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:28,318
...can history be changed, Uppalasoma?

1117
01:56:31,369 --> 01:56:35,977
Have you forgotten Satakarni
of the Satavahana dynasty...

1118
01:56:36,571 --> 01:56:41,909
...who prefixed his mother's name
Gautami and stabilized his rule?

1119
01:56:42,735 --> 01:56:43,733
Why?

1120
01:56:43,948 --> 01:56:47,634
Even after looking at
Rudramadevi's golden rule...

1121
01:56:47,789 --> 01:56:50,208
...don't you have faith?

1122
01:56:51,071 --> 01:56:52,914
She abolished taxes

1123
01:56:53,143 --> 01:56:57,021
With foresight she built
lakes for agriculture

1124
01:56:57,407 --> 01:57:00,748
She distributed agricultural
amenities to one and all

1125
01:57:00,938 --> 01:57:04,432
She built maternity hospitals
specially for women

1126
01:57:05,644 --> 01:57:07,334
All creature comforts

1127
01:57:07,731 --> 01:57:09,497
Prosperity and peace in plenty

1128
01:57:09,648 --> 01:57:12,413
She ensured you had
access to all of this

1129
01:57:13,512 --> 01:57:15,624
This is tomorrow's history

1130
01:57:16,275 --> 01:57:19,001
Chronicles for the future

1131
01:57:20,245 --> 01:57:22,088
Like Vikramarka period

1132
01:57:22,285 --> 01:57:24,013
And Shalivahana era

1133
01:57:24,156 --> 01:57:27,996
People will acclaim and pay tribute
to Rudramadevi's reign!

1134
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:31,751
Hari Hara Deva, Murari Deva
and Ambudeva

1135
01:57:32,268 --> 01:57:36,766
After 1000 years if history records
your name and mine in its annals...

1136
01:57:37,004 --> 01:57:41,343
...remember the sole credit
goes only to this lady

1137
01:57:42,979 --> 01:57:44,323
My dear subjects

1138
01:57:45,372 --> 01:57:49,442
We are striving to start
a new chapter in History

1139
01:57:50,288 --> 01:57:51,670
Until yesterday...

1140
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:55,762
...you cheered for
prince Rudradeva

1141
01:57:56,156 --> 01:57:57,154
Why?

1142
01:57:57,597 --> 01:57:58,864
For what?

1143
01:57:58,971 --> 01:58:03,733
Today why are you
opposing Rudramadevi?

1144
01:58:04,697 --> 01:58:06,853
Only because she is a girl

1145
01:58:08,202 --> 01:58:10,928
As soon as they knew
a woman is ruling our land...

1146
01:58:10,953 --> 01:58:14,102
...they robbed our houses
and set our fields ablaze

1147
01:58:14,127 --> 01:58:15,740
We women are scared
to even step out

1148
01:58:15,915 --> 01:58:18,219
Religious shelters are being
targeted all over the kingdom

1149
01:58:18,244 --> 01:58:20,010
Many religious leaders
are being killed

1150
01:58:20,396 --> 01:58:22,470
Of course

1151
01:58:22,675 --> 01:58:23,865
(multiple voices in assent)

1152
01:58:23,890 --> 01:58:25,580
It is the conspiracy of a few minds

1153
01:58:25,949 --> 01:58:30,634
If that is so, why didn't it happen
when Rudradeva was our prince?

1154
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:33,674
Because men symbolize fear

1155
01:58:33,976 --> 01:58:35,836
And women are inferior

1156
01:58:36,428 --> 01:58:40,362
For 25 years you hid the truth
because of this same fear?

1157
01:58:41,518 --> 01:58:45,128
Despite our unstinted support
to your reign all these years...

1158
01:58:45,322 --> 01:58:47,472
...we have lost faith
in the Kakatiya rule

1159
01:58:47,752 --> 01:58:50,210
We will ourselves rule over
our territories independently

1160
01:58:50,325 --> 01:58:52,130
Our Kamba land is
independent from today

1161
01:58:52,251 --> 01:58:55,093
Muriki land will not pay taxes
to Kakatiya kingdom from now on

1162
01:58:55,477 --> 01:58:57,627
Our Baga land is
also independent

1163
01:58:57,889 --> 01:58:59,771
If we cheer a woman ruler...

1164
01:59:00,047 --> 01:59:02,389
...what happens to the prestige
of our Renadu region?

1165
01:59:02,414 --> 01:59:05,985
Let us split!
Let us split!

1166
01:59:09,921 --> 01:59:12,686
(multiple voices in dissent)

1167
01:59:24,487 --> 01:59:26,522
Beloved subjects of my kingdom

1168
01:59:27,009 --> 01:59:28,814
Feudatory chiefs

1169
01:59:28,839 --> 01:59:32,986
I did not come to the throne
as Rudradeva to rule our kingdom

1170
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:37,347
I shouldered this responsibility
for the welfare of the people

1171
01:59:38,142 --> 01:59:41,368
'You took a bold decision
for the welfare of our kingdom'

1172
01:59:41,393 --> 01:59:45,233
'I shall remain as Rudradeva
till that goal is fulfilled'

1173
01:59:51,694 --> 01:59:54,766
You are overlooking
my reforms as Rudradeva

1174
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:58,093
You are merely looking at
my female form of Rudramadevi

1175
01:59:58,552 --> 02:00:00,472
Will not a woman who
transforms her house...

1176
02:00:00,497 --> 02:00:02,263
...be able to reform her kingdom?

1177
02:00:02,288 --> 02:00:03,939
I will not ask you
such a question

1178
02:00:04,203 --> 02:00:06,469
I leave it to each one of you to decide

1179
02:00:09,646 --> 02:00:12,449
If me being a woman is
the root cause of your problem

1180
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:15,448
If it will give you immense
happiness if I cease to exist...

1181
02:00:15,562 --> 02:00:17,520
...I do not want this throne

1182
02:00:21,682 --> 02:00:25,560
If you think being Rudradeva
all these years was a crime...

1183
02:00:25,684 --> 02:00:28,526
...I will accept whatever
punishment you mete out to me

1184
02:00:32,319 --> 02:00:34,969
Let the elders introspect
and announce their decision

1185
02:00:45,692 --> 02:00:48,687
Whatever scriptures
we look into carefully...

1186
02:00:48,917 --> 02:00:52,603
...befitting punishment for
Rudramadevi's crime

1187
02:00:53,285 --> 02:00:54,975
...is death sentence

1188
02:00:55,492 --> 02:00:58,026
However because she is a lady...

1189
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:01,773
...we make an exception and
exile her from the kingdom

1190
02:01:02,767 --> 02:01:05,071
She should renounce
any link to royalty

1191
02:01:05,570 --> 02:01:08,527
And live as a commoner

1192
02:01:09,070 --> 02:01:11,720
She must never use any weapons

1193
02:01:12,574 --> 02:01:15,531
The punishment should be
brought into effect immediately

1194
02:01:30,288 --> 02:01:33,898
25 years ago, the danger we feared
forced us to take this bold decision

1195
02:01:34,197 --> 02:01:37,768
That danger has now boomeranged
as an earthquake, Your Royal Majesty

1196
02:03:46,516 --> 02:03:47,975
A mere female?

1197
02:03:49,351 --> 02:03:52,845
Has a girl been the one
subjugating us all these years?

1198
02:03:53,144 --> 02:03:56,715
This Kakatiya secret that has
been revealed to the world...

1199
02:03:57,260 --> 02:04:00,025
...am I aware of it only now?

1200
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:03,062
Did Madanika sacrifice her life for us?

1201
02:04:03,273 --> 02:04:05,692
Is this how skilled
you are in spying?

1202
02:04:18,085 --> 02:04:22,463
Offering of blood for
the mighty sword is done

1203
02:04:23,544 --> 02:04:27,806
This war against
the Kakatiya kingdom...

1204
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:32,493
...should make the Kurukshetra war
pale into insignificance

1205
02:04:33,241 --> 02:04:38,463
It should exceed the piles of dead bodies
from Ashoka's Kalinga war

1206
02:04:39,103 --> 02:04:41,100
My dear brave warriors!

1207
02:04:41,595 --> 02:04:45,243
Beat our war drums

1208
02:04:57,336 --> 02:04:59,410
Everyone's mother
is Goddess Ellaiamma

1209
02:04:59,674 --> 02:05:01,248
This brave Goddess

1210
02:05:01,336 --> 02:05:02,488
Poor soul!

1211
02:05:02,513 --> 02:05:07,006
She sacrificed her head
to her own son Parasurama

1212
02:05:09,756 --> 02:05:11,177
You are the same

1213
02:05:11,384 --> 02:05:14,034
You have forsaken everything
for the welfare of your people

1214
02:05:14,059 --> 02:05:15,441
Queen of Orugallu

1215
02:05:15,681 --> 02:05:18,215
You've now laid your head
on the lap of this Goddess

1216
02:05:19,934 --> 02:05:21,585
Scars are a natural
consequence of war

1217
02:05:21,735 --> 02:05:23,386
These wounds are not
from your enemies

1218
02:05:23,411 --> 02:05:24,832
But from your own kith and kin

1219
02:05:25,096 --> 02:05:26,862
Come, let's go to
Nidavartyapuram

1220
02:05:26,990 --> 02:05:29,755
I'll place a throne in my heart
and make you my queen

1221
02:05:32,066 --> 02:05:34,216
If that's what
my father had wanted...

1222
02:05:34,542 --> 02:05:37,153
...he would have
raised me as a girl

1223
02:05:37,867 --> 02:05:41,131
My parents brought me up this way
for the welfare of my people

1224
02:05:42,417 --> 02:05:44,567
I need to fulfill
my father's desire

1225
02:05:45,304 --> 02:05:47,685
The lives of my people
should blossom anew

1226
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:51,629
Even if the enemies cross swords
you want to shower flowers on them?

1227
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:53,393
Don't you want
a life of your own?

1228
02:05:53,418 --> 02:05:55,031
Don't you love yourself?

1229
02:05:56,204 --> 02:05:59,035
You are here
in my life to love me

1230
02:05:59,227 --> 02:06:00,086
That's enough

1231
02:06:03,512 --> 02:06:05,931
But Rudramadevi
and Orugallu kingdom...

1232
02:06:06,229 --> 02:06:08,111
...cannot be separated by anyone

1233
02:06:09,093 --> 02:06:10,936
Your speech gives me goose bumps

1234
02:06:11,446 --> 02:06:12,636
Brilliant!

1235
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:16,127
Like a woman behind
every victorious warrior...

1236
02:06:16,334 --> 02:06:18,254
...I will be behind your bravery

1237
02:06:18,549 --> 02:06:20,008
Tell me what I should do

1238
02:06:20,033 --> 02:06:23,297
With my army, shall I wage war
against Hari Hara and Murari?

1239
02:06:23,966 --> 02:06:26,462
My father is still on the throne

1240
02:06:26,841 --> 02:06:28,531
Don't forget that

1241
02:06:28,849 --> 02:06:31,575
There is a greater danger
than these internal thieves

1242
02:06:32,954 --> 02:06:37,024
Stop Mahadeva the king of Devagiri
who is attacking us with his army

1243
02:06:37,636 --> 02:06:40,478
Go up straight west and
stop him in his tracks

1244
02:06:40,949 --> 02:06:43,637
Fight so that he does
not cross our boundary

1245
02:06:43,994 --> 02:06:46,720
You will hear news
of his death soon

1246
02:06:50,183 --> 02:06:52,564
Your Majesty! More than
the enemies of Devagiri...

1247
02:06:52,836 --> 02:06:55,255
...we have to escape from
the schemes of your kith and kin

1248
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,224
Your game is over, old man!

1249
02:06:56,645 --> 02:06:58,834
We have found out the tunnel
inside the palace itself

1250
02:06:59,216 --> 02:07:01,981
That will be the victorious way
for the army of Mahadeva

1251
02:07:02,006 --> 02:07:03,926
Have you joined hands
with the enemy?

1252
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:06,575
We even chop heads
for the sake of the throne

1253
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:08,082
What does it matter
if you join hands...

1254
02:07:08,107 --> 02:07:09,670
...or fall at others' feet?

1255
02:07:09,829 --> 02:07:11,096
Shiva Devaiah!

1256
02:07:11,433 --> 02:07:12,917
Our first enemy
is your intellect

1257
02:07:12,942 --> 02:07:14,132
I will-

1258
02:07:20,789 --> 02:07:24,322
His heart gave out before
my sword could be troubled

1259
02:07:24,474 --> 02:07:28,045
Throw his corpse to feed
the crocodiles in the moat

1260
02:07:29,825 --> 02:07:32,743
To the winner
is this Kakatiya kingdom

1261
02:07:33,006 --> 02:07:37,000
'On one hand the greedy chieftains
fought between themselves'

1262
02:07:37,334 --> 02:07:41,136
'The problem of Sandiveera
still loomed large on the other hand'

1263
02:07:45,443 --> 02:07:49,782
'The Kakatiya dynasty
was almost in shambles'

1264
02:07:49,807 --> 02:07:51,919
'Blood of the innocent
flowed like a river'

1265
02:07:51,944 --> 02:07:54,325
'The land was in chaos
without a proper ruler'

1266
02:07:54,451 --> 02:07:56,601
'People who shunned Rudramadevi...'

1267
02:07:56,847 --> 02:08:00,380
'...were oblivious of the fact she would
protect them like their mother'

1268
02:08:00,798 --> 02:08:05,022
'Shiva Devaiah who held his breath
under water opened his eyes'

1269
02:08:05,504 --> 02:08:08,576
(voices in despair and uproar)

1270
02:08:26,146 --> 02:08:30,255
"The kingdom is in dire straits"

1271
02:08:32,758 --> 02:08:36,982
"Caught in anarchy, look what awaits"

1272
02:08:40,142 --> 02:08:43,406
"Every direction every place
stream of blood in a maze"

1273
02:08:44,144 --> 02:08:47,562
"Our protecting deity
shower us your mercy"

1274
02:08:49,035 --> 02:08:52,145
"Why...o' why?"

1275
02:08:52,222 --> 02:08:56,331
"Why this vow of silence, Rudramadevi?"

1276
02:08:56,356 --> 02:09:00,503
"To win over generations of enmity
come to save us from this calamity"

1277
02:09:15,472 --> 02:09:18,621
"In our own deity's kingdom
atrocities demand a ransom?"

1278
02:09:19,407 --> 02:09:22,825
"In Rudra's realm
rivers of blood stream"

1279
02:09:22,937 --> 02:09:24,627
"You are no other
than Rudra's mother"

1280
02:09:24,652 --> 02:09:27,724
"To wreak vengeance with fervor
For the enemy to surrender"

1281
02:09:28,033 --> 02:09:29,723
"To flourish
or to perish?"

1282
02:09:29,828 --> 02:09:32,862
"Save us from this catastrophe"

1283
02:09:33,571 --> 02:09:37,603
"Rudramadevi"

1284
02:09:59,469 --> 02:10:02,234
We don't want chieftains
who crave for power

1285
02:10:02,455 --> 02:10:05,988
We want Rudramadevi who supports
her people to be our queen

1286
02:10:06,423 --> 02:10:08,727
Rudrama, you are our savior

1287
02:10:09,959 --> 02:10:12,225
Take this weapon!

1288
02:10:13,807 --> 02:10:18,722
Victory to queen Rudramadevi!

1289
02:10:20,563 --> 02:10:25,133
Rani Rudramadevi
may you be victorious

1290
02:10:34,358 --> 02:10:36,278
Your Majesty,
Shiva Devaiah is alive

1291
02:10:37,874 --> 02:10:42,021
Rudramadevi like Goddess Kali
is all set to wage a war against us

1292
02:10:42,395 --> 02:10:44,622
People are supporting her

1293
02:10:45,565 --> 02:10:47,160
I'll meet you later
if you are alive

1294
02:10:47,534 --> 02:10:48,724
Narrow escape!

1295
02:10:49,527 --> 02:10:51,332
If she wields a weapon...

1296
02:10:51,698 --> 02:10:54,303
...Rudramadevi can kill
thousands with just one stroke

1297
02:10:55,725 --> 02:10:57,184
How do we stop her?

1298
02:10:57,296 --> 02:11:01,750
Only soul who can stop
Rudramadevi is Mahadeva

1299
02:11:02,449 --> 02:11:04,177
Open the underground passage

1300
02:11:04,202 --> 02:11:06,276
Pave the way for
the world's greatest war

1301
02:12:46,984 --> 02:12:49,902
'Praise be to Goddess Shakti'

1302
02:12:50,109 --> 02:12:53,258
'Long live
Eradicator of evil'

1303
02:12:53,283 --> 02:12:56,509
'Praise be to Mahishasura Mardhini'

1304
02:12:56,534 --> 02:12:59,759
'Long live
The ever-powerful Shakti'

1305
02:15:03,436 --> 02:15:05,702
I underestimated
the 7 walls of the fort

1306
02:15:05,727 --> 02:15:08,108
Stones rain upon us when
the 1st stone-wall was broken

1307
02:15:08,244 --> 02:15:11,047
When the bamboo wall was crossed
waves of fire blaze round us

1308
02:15:11,418 --> 02:15:13,108
What a spectacular wonder this is!

1309
02:15:13,133 --> 02:15:15,744
What does the 5th wall
have in store I wonder?

1310
02:15:15,769 --> 02:15:17,151
Don't fret, brother

1311
02:15:17,826 --> 02:15:19,400
This is an iron wall

1312
02:15:19,425 --> 02:15:20,999
We are here

1313
02:15:21,253 --> 02:15:24,901
Just wait and watch how
Rudramadevi's game ends

1314
02:16:17,217 --> 02:16:18,599
Well done, brother

1315
02:16:19,008 --> 02:16:22,195
You rightly said our enmity
is equal to that of the snakes

1316
02:16:44,866 --> 02:16:48,092
Though just a girl, she has
taken the form of a mongoose

1317
02:16:51,178 --> 02:16:54,519
The way she twirls her sword
it may even reach our throats

1318
02:17:18,750 --> 02:17:21,323
Who will finish
Rudrama's game?

1319
02:17:31,094 --> 02:17:34,665
Look who is here to quell
Rudramadevi's bravery!

1320
02:17:34,761 --> 02:17:37,449
Gona Ganna Reddy is here

1321
02:17:52,092 --> 02:17:54,319
Kakatiya war has
reached its climax

1322
02:17:54,344 --> 02:17:55,918
We have all become friends

1323
02:17:56,304 --> 02:17:58,262
Now whom can we
join hands with?

1324
02:17:58,326 --> 02:18:01,360
We are not here to join hands
with anyone, Uppalasoma!

1325
02:18:01,885 --> 02:18:05,072
With great pleasure we are here
to watch everyone die

1326
02:18:05,097 --> 02:18:07,363
Rudramadevi is in the clutches
of Gona Ganna Reddy

1327
02:18:07,782 --> 02:18:09,740
Gona Ganna Reddy
in the clutches of Mahadeva

1328
02:18:10,293 --> 02:18:13,711
As soon as Hari Hara and
Murari Deva kill Mahadeva...

1329
02:18:13,892 --> 02:18:16,350
...we shall aim our sword
at whoever is remaining

1330
02:18:16,375 --> 02:18:19,831
In war, it doesn't matter
who is the bravest warrior

1331
02:18:20,446 --> 02:18:24,555
The one who wields
the final blow is the victor

1332
02:19:07,857 --> 02:19:09,508
He is a warrior of acclaim

1333
02:19:09,761 --> 02:19:11,105
He has positioned his army...

1334
02:19:11,130 --> 02:19:13,472
...in the eagle formation
to thwart his foes

1335
02:19:13,742 --> 02:19:15,892
Like an eagle can
tear a snake apart...

1336
02:19:15,917 --> 02:19:19,104
...Gona Ganna Reddy
will kill Rudramadevi

1337
02:20:53,655 --> 02:20:56,113
Long live Gona Ganna Reddy!

1338
02:20:57,811 --> 02:21:00,806
Long live queen Rudramadevi!

1339
02:21:21,647 --> 02:21:24,028
As long as there is
breath within me...

1340
02:21:24,053 --> 02:21:27,778
...I will not let even the shadow of Yama,
the Lord of death touch Rudramadevi

1341
02:21:29,414 --> 02:21:32,947
Like Virabhadhra is the guardian
to the Goddess Kali of Orugallu...

1342
02:21:32,972 --> 02:21:37,503
...Gona Ganna Reddy has become
Rudramadevi's protector

1343
02:21:46,497 --> 02:21:48,302
If Ganna Reddy and
Rudramadevi see us-

1344
02:21:48,327 --> 02:21:50,324
We should raise
the white flag of truce

1345
02:22:13,705 --> 02:22:15,193
Why are your knees trembling?

1346
02:22:15,218 --> 02:22:18,021
To murder or dethrone Rudramadevi...

1347
02:22:18,702 --> 02:22:21,275
...Gona Ganna Reddy is not a puppet!

1348
02:22:21,967 --> 02:22:24,617
I am the Kakatiya people's asset

1349
02:22:27,348 --> 02:22:32,839
I ruthlessly killed every feudal lord
who tried to loot this land

1350
02:22:36,943 --> 02:22:40,975
I stopped Anamika's wedding
so you don't join hands to gain power

1351
02:22:50,570 --> 02:22:52,682
I robbed your treasury...

1352
02:22:53,084 --> 02:22:57,346
...to prevent you from forming
an independent army of your own

1353
02:22:57,870 --> 02:23:03,092
I returned all that wealth as
treasure troves to build the 7 walls

1354
02:23:07,010 --> 02:23:09,199
For Rudramadevi's army
to be strong and mighty...

1355
02:23:09,224 --> 02:23:11,259
...I motivated every
youngster to become

1356
02:23:11,395 --> 02:23:13,661
...not a robber like me,
but a brave warrior

1357
02:23:19,224 --> 02:23:24,754
I was the 1st person to know
Rudramadevi's life-secret

1358
02:23:25,374 --> 02:23:31,249
I was also the one to slit Nagadeva's
throat when he found out the secret

1359
02:23:36,948 --> 02:23:39,790
I foiled your sinister plans of
destroying Rudramadevi's family

1360
02:23:39,879 --> 02:23:41,837
And I saved this kingdom

1361
02:23:47,948 --> 02:23:51,865
Branding me as a robber
is not your dishonesty mask

1362
02:23:51,890 --> 02:23:56,306
Responsibility offered by
queen Rudramadevi as a royalty mark

1363
02:23:58,511 --> 02:24:00,393
You deceived us
with your masquerade

1364
02:24:00,431 --> 02:24:02,197
- Betrayal
- Treason

1365
02:24:02,222 --> 02:24:05,064
The enemy cautions us
how to plan a war

1366
02:24:05,585 --> 02:24:08,152
He also decides
which weapon to use

1367
02:24:08,177 --> 02:24:10,673
To your crimes and schemes
this itself is the right verdict

1368
02:24:11,005 --> 02:24:14,006
The diamond shield that guards
the dignity of the Kakatiya kingdom...

1369
02:24:14,031 --> 02:24:15,337
...is Gona Ganna Reddy

1370
02:24:16,218 --> 02:24:18,023
Hey! Gona Ganna Reddy

1371
02:24:27,534 --> 02:24:30,184
You escaped my
clutches too many times

1372
02:24:30,209 --> 02:24:33,281
My father slaughtered
your father like a dog

1373
02:24:33,306 --> 02:24:36,954
I will kill you today
and make your Anamika mine!

1374
02:24:37,577 --> 02:24:39,727
And Rudramadevi too-

1375
02:24:39,752 --> 02:24:41,173
Shut up!

1376
02:24:48,093 --> 02:24:51,395
I said I had marked another
auspicious time for you to die

1377
02:24:51,622 --> 02:24:52,928
That is now
This moment

1378
02:24:52,953 --> 02:24:53,951
Rudrama!

1379
02:24:54,931 --> 02:24:57,043
Their story is
in your hands

1380
02:24:58,279 --> 02:25:01,159
The auspicious time of death
is not marked for us but for you

1381
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:02,182
Rudrama

1382
02:25:02,495 --> 02:25:04,031
Let us fight

1383
02:26:22,531 --> 02:26:24,067
Rudramadevi!

1384
02:28:01,303 --> 02:28:03,991
Mahadeva is the most
monstrous demon

1385
02:28:04,778 --> 02:28:06,775
You could have
killed him yourself

1386
02:28:07,776 --> 02:28:11,462
Devagiri Mahadeva is the foremost
enemy of the Kakatiya kingdom

1387
02:28:12,116 --> 02:28:14,919
If I killed him
it is not a big deal

1388
02:28:15,593 --> 02:28:20,700
The Kakatiya people who dreamt
a male royal heir will protect them...

1389
02:28:21,151 --> 02:28:23,685
...their expectations should
be met by a woman

1390
02:28:24,151 --> 02:28:25,994
In no way is a woman
any less brave

1391
02:28:26,019 --> 02:28:27,458
This is the time for
people to realize it

1392
02:28:27,483 --> 02:28:31,091
So Rudrama must kill him

1393
02:28:31,789 --> 02:28:33,632
This must become history

1394
02:29:14,023 --> 02:29:16,557
My father must not
see your corpse

1395
02:29:16,654 --> 02:29:18,046
But your defeat

1396
02:29:20,285 --> 02:29:22,090
Beat the drums of victory

1397
02:29:35,705 --> 02:29:39,084
(Holy chant)

1398
02:29:43,142 --> 02:29:46,406
'Of your own accord you ended
your life as Rudradeva'

1399
02:29:46,868 --> 02:29:50,247
'Now I will end your life
as Rudramadevi'

1400
02:29:50,431 --> 02:29:53,541
Kill Mahadeva

1401
02:29:54,055 --> 02:29:57,204
Don't spare his life

1402
02:29:57,333 --> 02:29:59,215
Kill Mahadeva

1403
02:30:00,138 --> 02:30:02,792
A war is between
the armies of 2 lands

1404
02:30:03,189 --> 02:30:04,917
2 kings should combat

1405
02:30:06,684 --> 02:30:09,948
But not between
the subjects of 2 kingdoms

1406
02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:11,560
Chief minister!

1407
02:30:12,094 --> 02:30:14,206
Without thinking twice,
cut him into pieces

1408
02:30:14,231 --> 02:30:15,575
Stop, Veerabhadra

1409
02:30:16,913 --> 02:30:19,179
Even if the enmity is
Ganapati Deva's...

1410
02:30:19,746 --> 02:30:22,280
...only Rudramadevi
must put an end to it

1411
02:30:24,098 --> 02:30:25,749
Who is your enmity directed at?

1412
02:30:25,913 --> 02:30:27,603
On our own motherland?

1413
02:30:28,930 --> 02:30:33,461
If we keep fighting internally
what will be the fate of our kingdom?

1414
02:30:35,108 --> 02:30:37,066
Thanks to our disunity...

1415
02:30:37,091 --> 02:30:40,969
...foreigners from Alexander
to Ghazni have tried to rule us

1416
02:30:41,387 --> 02:30:43,499
They plundered our wealth

1417
02:30:45,638 --> 02:30:50,169
In the end we became slaves to
a slave king Qutubudin Aibak

1418
02:30:51,841 --> 02:30:53,377
We were divided and ruled

1419
02:30:53,735 --> 02:30:56,231
Did we not learn
from our mistakes?

1420
02:30:57,681 --> 02:30:58,756
Mahadeva

1421
02:30:59,193 --> 02:31:02,150
If those who drank the same
mother's milk can bond as brothers...

1422
02:31:02,513 --> 02:31:06,775
...drinking water from the same river
can't we live as brothers and sisters!

1423
02:31:07,369 --> 02:31:11,055
Our duty as ruler is to ensure
our subjects are happy

1424
02:31:18,515 --> 02:31:20,358
Forgive me, Your Majesty

1425
02:31:22,263 --> 02:31:24,051
All these years claiming
to forgive my father...

1426
02:31:24,076 --> 02:31:26,649
...you disrespected us
in the most arrogant way

1427
02:31:27,718 --> 02:31:29,600
Today in front of everyone...

1428
02:31:30,229 --> 02:31:32,149
...I forgive you

1429
02:31:32,918 --> 02:31:34,339
Long live, queen Rudramadevi

1430
02:31:34,364 --> 02:31:37,513
Mahadeva, where
did you jump from?

1431
02:31:39,704 --> 02:31:44,008
You stand here today
like a beggar asking for alms

1432
02:31:44,124 --> 02:31:46,198
How strange is your fate

1433
02:31:46,644 --> 02:31:49,524
Amulet on my hip thread!

1434
02:31:49,771 --> 02:31:51,614
Instead of dissecting you to pieces...

1435
02:31:51,867 --> 02:31:54,785
...forgiving you is
a bigger punishment

1436
02:31:55,941 --> 02:31:59,282
Rudrama, I'll be with the people

1437
02:32:00,360 --> 02:32:01,397
Always

1438
02:32:01,874 --> 02:32:03,448
I will protect them

1439
02:32:03,621 --> 02:32:07,154
You sacrificed the throne to be
a friend of the people in all ways

1440
02:32:07,932 --> 02:32:09,391
Long live Ganna Reddy!

1441
02:32:10,508 --> 02:32:11,522
Gona Ganna Reddy!

1442
02:32:16,901 --> 02:32:18,501
My dear Anamika

1443
02:32:18,636 --> 02:32:20,172
This is not the right time-

1444
02:32:20,575 --> 02:32:22,226
Keep quiet

1445
02:32:23,438 --> 02:32:26,241
Amulet on my hip thread!

1446
02:32:26,923 --> 02:32:30,801
'Queen Rudramadevi's journey
of triumph did not end with this'

1447
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:35,110
'Continuing the progeny and her bravery
was heir apparent Prathaparudhra'

1448
02:32:35,135 --> 02:32:39,436
'History will always trumpet her glory'

1449
02:34:08,570 --> 02:34:14,015
"Born in our brave soil India
was a woman akin a cheetah"

1450
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:20,520
"With Goddess Kali’s scimitar
seated on a lion she snarled to conquer"

1451
02:34:20,545 --> 02:34:25,221
"As Sambavi and Bhairavi
she destroyed evil in forms of fury"

1452
02:34:25,246 --> 02:34:29,931
"Like the Goddess Adi Parashakti
avatar of Divine Mother Shakthi"

1453
02:34:31,105 --> 02:34:36,212
"Like Vishnu as Parasurama with an axe
Ferocious as a lion when she attacks"

1454
02:34:36,567 --> 02:34:41,060
"An everlasting beacon of light
Brave heart day and night"

1455
02:34:41,927 --> 02:34:47,303
"Rudramadevi as Bhadrakali
inscribed her name in HIS-story!"

1456
02:34:47,666 --> 02:34:52,543
"In directions 8, a torch to guide
your fame is acclaimed far and wide"

1457
02:34:52,947 --> 02:34:57,939
"Examples of the king’s bravery
Embellish sky-high his story"

1458
02:34:57,964 --> 02:35:04,024
"You are our life's lamp, we revere
You are our dawn everywhere"

1459
02:35:04,079 --> 02:35:08,380
"In a land which extols the scriptures
no place ever for woes or remorse"

1460
02:35:09,717 --> 02:35:14,747
"Like lashes to the eyes, our protector
Beloved king, our shield and shelter"

1461
02:35:14,811 --> 02:35:20,187
"Treating all girls like his mother
Most dignified king ever"

1462
02:35:21,163 --> 02:35:25,650
"In directions 8, a torch to guide
your fame is acclaimed far and wide"

1463
02:35:26,349 --> 02:35:31,802
"Examples of the king’s bravery
Embellish sky-high his story"

1464
