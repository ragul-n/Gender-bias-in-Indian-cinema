1
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:16,750
Why are you taking it off? Come sit.

2
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,208
Bulbbul!

3
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,541
Bulbbul?

4
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,666
Bulbbul?

5
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,333
Bulbbul?

6
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,541
Where is this girl?

7
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,541
Caught you!

8
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,208
On the trees again.

9
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,375
Who is this, Auntie?

10
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,541
Bit of a scruffy urchin...

11
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,041
but we will take of her.

12
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:11,791
Hey!

13
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,250
He's right.

14
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,041
Now I have to get you ready
all over again.

15
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,666
Auntie, why do I have to wear toe rings?

16
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,458
Because there's a nerve here.

17
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,916
If it is not pressed,
girls tend to fly away.

18
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,583
Like a bird?

19
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,000
No. It is to control you.

20
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:50,875
Auntie...

21
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,958
what's "control"?

22
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,458
Auntie!

23
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,791
Dad! Auntie!

24
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,500
What are you doing, you lunatic?

25
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,125
She must have gotten frightened.

26
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,125
Auntie.

27
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:51,750
Auntie...

28
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,833
Do you want to listen to a story?

29
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,833
Is it a scary story?

30
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,208
Yes.

31
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,708
Sure.

32
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,416
A long, long time ago...

33
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,916
there was a Demon-Woman.

34
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,083
<i>She lived on trees
in the deep, dark woods.</i>

35
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,083
<i>She had feet that were twisted
all the way around.</i>

36
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,416
<i>That blood-thirsty demon waited...</i>

37
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,916
<i>and waited for the day...</i>

38
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,125
<i>when the princess would come...</i>

39
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,041
<i>so that she could gobble her up.</i>

40
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,875
Doll.

41
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,125
Mahendra!

42
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,166
I forbade you to come here, didn't I?

43
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,541
Doll.

44
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,666
Binodini.

45
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,791
Can't you keep your husband in check?

46
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,458
Forgive me, Milord.

47
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,875
Mahendra...

48
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,125
my brother.

49
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,625
He's like a kid.

50
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,458
Where is he?

51
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:20,958
Who?

52
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,875
My husband.

53
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,041
That's me.

54
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,666
No. He was small like me.

55
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,708
He was with me in the palanquin.

56
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,666
He told me a story.

57
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,375
His name was...

58
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,125
Satya.

59
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,625
When you grow up,
you'll know the difference...

60
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,750
between a husband and a brother-in-law.

61
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,500
Slow down!

62
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,583
Sorry, Sir Satya.

63
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,333
This place is not safe.

64
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,958
There is danger here.

65
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,166
She lives here.

66
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,458
Who?

67
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,041
The Demon-Woman.

68
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,125
You woke up, Sire?

69
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,708
Go to sleep. I will wake you up
once we reach the manor.

70
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,958
Is sister-in-law asleep?

71
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,750
Yes, Sire.

72
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,458
- May I serve you dinner?
- No. It's fine.

73
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,000
Please don't be upset, Milady.

74
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,541
Too late for that.

75
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,333
And what will your poor first wife do?

76
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,208
They'll live together like sisters.

77
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,250
Get out.

78
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:04,000
If she suffers in any way,
you'll have to answer to me.

79
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,916
Are you playing at lord of the manor,
sister-in-law?

80
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,791
One, two...

81
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,625
Three, four...

82
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,708
Five, six...

83
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,958
Seven, eight...

84
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,375
Nine, ten...

85
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,583
Eleven, 12...

86
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,625
<i>Then what happened?</i>

87
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:42,791
Then the Demon-Woman blew out
all the candles in the princess's room.

88
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,208
<i>Fool!</i>

89
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,500
<i>Then?</i>

90
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:52,458
She tiptoed to the princess's bed, and...

91
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,916
To what do we owe
the pleasure of your visit?

92
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,083
Oh, I see. Come to check
on your inheritance, have you?

93
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,250
Sister-in-law...

94
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,958
Haven't heard from you for five years.

95
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,458
It can't be
that you suddenly missed me.

96
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,625
I wrote to His Lordship...

97
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,541
and always asked after you.

98
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,000
He didn't respond.

99
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,583
I wanted to come three years ago...

100
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,666
when Mahendra... was killed.

101
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,166
They say that...

102
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,375
the Demon-Woman killed him.

103
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,791
And you believe this nonsense?

104
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,250
Not at all.

105
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,375
Binodini says so.

106
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,750
So much has changed
in these past five years.

107
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,416
Even His Lordship left home.

108
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,333
What went wrong?

109
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,666
Would you like to meet Binodini?

110
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,791
Binodini.

111
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,875
Little brother.

112
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,041
The goddess has not done right by me.

113
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,125
Really?

114
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,916
How can you say the rosary
and curse god in the same breath?

115
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,333
A litany of prayers feels like a lament.

116
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,125
Spent my whole life praying,

117
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,416
and see...

118
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:25,833
what I got in return.

119
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,416
I was immersed in prayers
when the Demon-Woman killed Mahendra.

120
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,250
Now, even if someone dies of a fever
or falls off a tree,

121
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,583
people blame it on the Demon-Woman.

122
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,541
Really?

123
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,041
Did Mahendra have a fever?

124
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,833
He was lying there
drowned in his own blood.

125
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,291
You witnessed it.

126
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,791
Sounds like an animal attack.

127
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:38,916
Do you remember Brother Indranil
used to tell us of a man-eating tiger?

128
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,375
There were bloody twisted footprints...
on the floor.

129
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,458
It was the Demon-Woman.

130
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,875
The same nonsense again.

131
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,708
There's been no Demon-Woman until now.

132
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,708
Where did she suddenly appear from?

133
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,291
From the trees.

134
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,375
What...

135
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,041
<i>Then? Go on.</i>

136
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:20,250
She tiptoed to the princess's bed, and...

137
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,750
What are you two doing in the dark?

138
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,375
Why do you spoil everything?

139
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,708
I'm so sorry, Milady.

140
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,708
I just came to tell you
that your husband needs you.

141
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,541
Why?

142
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,791
I have no idea.

143
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,958
He should ask for me.

144
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,416
I'm the one who takes care of him.

145
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,458
I don't know why
he still wants his Bulbbul.

146
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,000
How does one tell him...

147
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,375
that his Bulbbul only wants Satya?

148
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,708
She sleeps during the day.

149
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,458
Hunts at night.

150
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,000
All right.

151
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,000
So even I will hunt at night.

152
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,750
Binodini will only be satisfied

153
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,125
when you've stuffed and mounted
the head of the Demon-Woman on the wall.

154
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,208
Tiger, deer...

155
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:23,916
Demon-Woman!

156
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,791
Where did the sweet little lady
I knew disappear?

157
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,000
What did you do with her?

158
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,250
I gobbled her up.

159
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,458
Where is Her Ladyship?

160
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,541
She's downstairs in the veranda.

161
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,291
You're obsessed with my feet.

162
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,750
How observant of you.

163
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,916
Hey, have you met Dr. Sudip?

164
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,458
Doctor?

165
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,666
Is everything okay?

166
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,583
Yes.

167
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,375
He just came to visit.

168
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,708
I will leave now.
I have got to go check on her.

169
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,041
When will that master mend his ways?

170
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:39,916
Which master?

171
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,041
Master Dinkar.

172
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,125
He's a fine man.

173
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,333
His wife's broken bones
tell another story.

174
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,208
She is also of no help.
She keeps saying...

175
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,458
"I fell off the stairs."

176
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,583
So maybe it's true.

177
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,416
There is only one house
in this place that has stairs.

178
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:10,875
Milady.

179
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,375
How many times have I told you
not to call me "Milady"?

180
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,750
Whatever you say... Milady.

181
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,125
Do you want to go on a hunt
with Sir Satya?

182
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,083
I save lives.
I don't know how to take them.

183
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,125
Sire.

184
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,166
Why do you look so annoyed?

185
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,250
You're not even veiled.

186
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,041
Go.

187
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,583
Aren't you getting late for your hunt?

188
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,708
- Master Dinkar.
- Yes, Sir Satya.

189
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,041
- Are these all the men you could gather?
- Everyone is afraid of the Demon-Woman...

190
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,833
Enough of this nonsense. Let's go.

191
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,833
Sir Satya!

192
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:18,375
Sire, at least now you know
that it is the Demon-Woman.

193
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:19,875
A murderer.

194
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,000
It's a human being.

195
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,208
A man.

196
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,666
Inform the police officer
that someone killed Master Dinkar.

197
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,958
Yes, Sire.

198
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,541
I live close by.

199
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,583
<i>We can keep the body there for the night.</i>

200
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,708
<i>You stay so close to the forest.</i>

201
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,000
Did you see...

202
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,166
or hear anything?

203
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,666
No.

204
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,291
Nothing.

205
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,125
Neither an animal...

206
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:07,583
nor a human.

207
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,250
Nothing.

208
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,208
How was the hunt?

209
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,500
Master Dinkar was killed.

210
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,333
And it wasn't an animal.

211
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,666
It's the work of a man.

212
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,583
Why?

213
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,458
Why not a woman?

214
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:01,750
What woman is capable
of such a brutal murder?

215
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:02,666
Milady.

216
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,958
Feels like... nothing has changed.

217
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,208
The two of you...

218
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,208
chatting away.

219
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,958
To what do we owe this pleasure?

220
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,083
Satya did not tell you?

221
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,000
He asked me to come.

222
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,166
He said you are all alone here...

223
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,541
day and night.

224
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,750
Anyone can walk right in
and take advantage of you.

225
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,708
- That's why I...
- No.

226
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:42,708
I just thought it is
Mahendra's death anniversary.

227
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:44,750
- Right.
- I thought we could all be together.

228
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,000
And you would want
to hold a prayer meet for him.

229
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:49,916
Right?

230
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,125
The police officer is here, Milady.

231
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,500
Tell him I'm coming.

232
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:59,041
Now I'm here, sister-in-law,
you can relax.

233
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,583
It behooves us to do what we are meant to.

234
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,291
You are the lady of the house,
not the lord.

235
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,458
What I mean is...

236
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:22,041
how long will you do everything?

237
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,166
You look exhausted.

238
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:30,958
Maybe because of the color,
or maybe gray does not suit you.

239
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,833
Everyone is not as fortunate as you...

240
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,875
to look nice even in dull, plain clothes.

241
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,666
<i>Oh, my</i>

242
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:49,458
<i>You shameless hussy</i>

243
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:53,250
<i>Why do you walk down the garden path</i>

244
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:57,458
<i>When you know
It leads to that bastard?</i>

245
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,375
Milady.

246
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,625
Come.

247
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,833
Sit. Come.

248
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,875
Let me oil your hair.

249
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,708
Later?

250
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,375
The jewelers have sent new things.

251
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:18,625
Have a look.

252
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,916
Aren't they exquisite?

253
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,625
At least choose a trinket or two.

254
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,375
As it is,
you hardly got anything from home.

255
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:31,041
You look like a drab little thing
decked up in all your dowry.

256
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,958
What if people say...

257
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:36,250
I look more like the lady of the house
than you do?

258
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,500
I don't care.

259
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,833
Yes. You care nothing
for what people say or think.

260
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:48,000
At least get new toe rings.

261
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,250
Yours seem to have loosened a bit.

262
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,708
I'll take it later.

263
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,916
<i>Oh, my</i>

264
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:09,833
<i>You shameless hussy</i>

265
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,750
<i>Throwing caution to the winds</i>

266
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:17,583
<i>Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, why do you cross the threshold?</i>

267
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,541
<i>I beg of you</i>

268
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,666
- Rest in peace!
- Rest in peace!

269
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:31,125
- Rest in peace!
- Rest in peace!

270
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:36,125
- Rest in peace!
- Rest in peace!

271
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:40,750
Subhashish, what is the point
of being a police officer?

272
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:48,250
There have been so many murders,
but you don't even have any suspects.

273
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,000
Suspicions do not count.

274
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:56,666
Our British law asks for proof.

275
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,208
Let's go, Master.

276
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,708
<i>A murderer.</i>

277
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,083
<i>It's a human being.</i>

278
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,208
<i>A man.</i>

279
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,541
<i>You stay so close to the forest.</i>

280
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,958
<i>Did you see anything... or hear anything?</i>

281
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,166
Shall I make paan?

282
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:58,458
Sister-in-law, since when has
the doctor been here?

283
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:03,958
He was...

284
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,083
here before your brother left home.

285
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:17,500
Does he...

286
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,541
visit here a lot?

287
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,333
It's not like I live here.

288
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:29,750
How would I know?

289
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:37,041
When you were here, did he visit then?

290
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,541
We were just talking about you.

291
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,208
I should leave.

292
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,708
I have some work with the police officer.
I will see you at dinner.

293
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,791
He was questioning me about Sudip.

294
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:25,375
Dr. Sudip is...

295
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,791
a fine man.

296
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,916
Maybe it was just a casual query.

297
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,500
And you were adding your two bits.

298
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:43,291
Me?

299
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,666
I didn't.

300
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,250
Milady, you know me.

301
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,750
I never mean any harm
or say anything bad about anyone.

302
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,250
Shall I make paan?

303
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,916
Yes. Go right ahead.

304
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,208
Bulbbul.

305
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,833
No.

306
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:47,750
- Play...
- Please don't.

307
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,375
- Play...
- Please don't.

308
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:51,416
Mahendra.

309
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,458
Is he sulking?

310
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:14,958
Satya.

311
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,333
Brother.

312
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:23,958
Come here!

313
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:24,875
Happy?

314
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:36,916
I've asked the groundsman
to pluck some mangoes.

315
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:41,708
Will you make some relish for me,

316
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:44,708
or are you going
to eat them all yourself?

317
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,208
Paan?

318
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,625
So...

319
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:21,083
I got you some perfume.

320
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,666
So have you thought about the proposal?

321
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,833
Proposal?

322
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,250
The marriage proposal for Satya.

323
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:30,833
I had told you.

324
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,333
Madam, what do you think?

325
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:37,708
"Madam"?

326
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,833
No...

327
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,833
I think I put too much catechu
in the paan.

328
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,666
A slip of the tongue.

329
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,583
I...

330
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:52,250
I meant... "Milady."

331
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:54,541
So tell us, Milady.

332
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:57,416
Should we get Satya married?

333
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,333
Why do you need to ask her?

334
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:02,250
Hey.

335
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,125
She has the first claim to Satya.

336
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,333
Shouldn't we check with her
before we get someone else for him?

337
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:12,416
Shouldn't we ask Satya?

338
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:14,875
What?

339
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:23,916
About the proposal...
that Binodini has got for him.

340
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:31,833
You're not happy about it.

341
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,666
When I write my bit
as a straightforward story,

342
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,416
you turn it into a spooky one.

343
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,041
Now, where did this girl's ghost
come from?

344
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:59,125
You wrote this bit. Now explain it to me.

345
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,333
Sister-in-law...

346
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:16,500
wasn't your childhood home blue in color?

347
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,333
Why don't we color this place blue?

348
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,166
It's looking a little shabby,

349
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:30,541
and that way,
you won't miss your childhood home.

350
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,958
Why do we need to paint it?

351
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,708
- It's fine.
- Hey.

352
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:39,083
We both sit and write here.

353
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,750
Shouldn't it look pretty?

354
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,250
Where will you get the time to write
after you are married?

355
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,166
Married?

356
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:51,458
Binodini has got a proposal for you.

357
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,125
I'm not getting married.

358
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,000
Everyone gets married.

359
00:40:58,416 --> 00:40:59,583
Priests don't,

360
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,625
minstrels don't,

361
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:03,625
neither do owls.

362
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:06,375
And if you all force me to,

363
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:10,791
I will become like a gypsy
and roam around singing songs.

364
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:12,875
<i>Oh, my</i>

365
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,166
<i>You shameless hussy</i>

366
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,833
<i>Oh, my</i>

367
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:20,458
<i>You shameless hussy</i>

368
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:27,041
<i>It's not his fault.</i>

369
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,958
It's his age.

370
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,833
He spends all his time with her.

371
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:38,833
This was bound to happen.

372
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,500
Why don't you ever wear shoes?

373
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,041
It's exhausting how you never learn.

374
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:14,416
I am making arrangements
for you to go to London.

375
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:17,875
Really?

376
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,166
I have told Binodini.

377
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,208
You can always get married later.

378
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,583
- First, complete your education.
- London?

379
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:28,541
Don't you remember?

380
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:32,583
I mentioned that Satya will go to London
to study law.

381
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,333
But don't just study.

382
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:38,375
Travel, have fun.

383
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:42,958
And then write me letters
telling me everything.

384
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,083
I'll write every single week.

385
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,333
But now?

386
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,833
- He has to leave now?
- Not now.

387
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:52,541
After the festival.

388
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:57,083
We will need to get
warm clothes stitched for you.

389
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,083
I've heard it gets cold there.

390
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:00,500
Snows as well.

391
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:04,958
But, Milord, the festival
is only three months away.

392
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,625
How will we arrange everything?

393
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:11,458
It's not like you have to do anything.

394
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,833
Why don't you come along?

395
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,833
Not now. Maybe later.

396
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:20,625
Just three months.

397
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,875
I have written my bit.

398
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,000
Now you have to write the rest.

399
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,791
How will we ever complete this story?

400
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:58,125
There is still time.

401
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:04,208
What about that house by the pond?

402
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,750
You were going to have it painted.

403
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,041
I will before I leave.

404
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:15,125
Then you can sit there and write.

405
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:18,916
I'm scared of being there alone.

406
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,708
I'm scared of being here alone.

407
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:40,416
Who will talk to me now? Whom will I...

408
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:44,041
I will write every day.

409
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,625
I will come back soon.

410
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,500
What if you don't? Then?

411
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,416
At least light the lamp.

412
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:33,583
What is that?

413
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,083
Nothing.

414
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,166
Why do you look so guilty, Bulbbul?

415
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,583
No.

416
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:56,500
That is... It's just...

417
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,250
something personal.

418
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:04,333
The only thing personal
in a wife's life is her husband.

419
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,833
I'm headed to Calcutta...

420
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:20,750
along with Satya.

421
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:27,333
Why?

422
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,375
Why are you taking Satya?

423
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:35,000
We have to get...
his travel documents prepared.

424
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:06,166
<i>One, two...</i>

425
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,291
<i>Three, four...</i>

426
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,208
<i>Five, six...</i>

427
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,708
<i>Seven, eight...</i>

428
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,833
<i>Nine, ten...</i>

429
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:19,791
<i>Eleven, 12...</i>

430
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:21,708
<i>Thirteen, 14...</i>

431
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,041
<i>Ready or not, here I come!</i>

432
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,000
<i>Ready or not, here I come!</i>

433
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:02,875
Oh, you're back, Milord?

434
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:09,250
Satya?

435
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,541
I've sent him to London.

436
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:38,750
SATYAJEET THAKUR
MRS. BULBBUL CHAUDHARY

437
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,666
No.

438
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,208
Is Mahendra still asleep?

439
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,125
Yes.

440
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,541
How is Milady doing?

441
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,833
It's silly of me to ask.

442
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:46,250
Of course she must be devastated.

443
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,500
She must be in mourning...

444
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:37,750
Satya
Bulbbul

445
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,583
Do you have to leave?

446
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,000
There's nothing here for me.

447
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:28,291
Don't worry.

448
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:31,125
I'll keep sending money.

449
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:35,750
She hasn't yet gained consciousness.

450
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:40,125
I have done the needful, but her feet...

451
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:41,750
She fell from the stairs.

452
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:44,833
She fell from the stairs?

453
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:48,833
Pay the doctor...

454
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:52,625
and give him a little tip
for his services.

455
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:17,916
I'm sorry to bother you this early,

456
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,208
but there has been another murder.

457
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:27,166
There's a witness, a little girl.
She seems to be in shock.

458
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:30,291
Poor thing. She was saying...

459
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:32,875
What?

460
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,750
The goddess killed him.

461
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:39,375
I would like to speak to her.

462
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,416
She's sedated.

463
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,833
The doctor gave her a pill.

464
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:47,000
Which doctor?

465
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:48,458
Dr. Sudip.

466
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:52,333
Fortunately, he was close at hand.

467
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:13,125
Thief.

468
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:17,958
It's a fine.

469
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:22,291
You haven't come to see me for days.

470
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:29,208
I thought Sir Satya is here,
so you would be busy.

471
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:31,916
Oh, he's the busy one.

472
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:34,958
He has a new hobby these days.

473
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:37,291
What were those stories
you used to read to me?

474
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:40,208
- The one with the detective.
- Yes. Sherlock.

475
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:41,166
Yes.

476
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:44,375
So Satya is playing Sherlock these days.

477
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,333
It's not a joke.

478
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:50,375
He suspects you.

479
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:55,416
Actually, there is not even
a speck of truth to it. So why worry?

480
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,083
Depends on what he suspects me of.

481
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:07,458
I have no expectations.

482
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:14,208
You know what?

483
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,625
You are way out of my league.

484
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:24,000
Which is why I draw boundaries...

485
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,958
to keep myself a little safe.

486
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:33,958
Coward.

487
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:34,875
Oh, yeah.

488
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:24,125
- Are these all the crime reports?
- Yes, Sir Satya.

489
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:27,250
This signature?

490
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,208
It's Dr. Sudip's.

491
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:32,000
He came to examine the body.

492
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,166
What are these papers?

493
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:10,625
It's a story.

494
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:28,083
A scary story.

495
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:50,500
Want to hear it?

496
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,083
A man comes to town...

497
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:10,708
and suddenly, people start getting killed.

498
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:14,625
But this is not the scary bit.

499
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:17,666
A girl falls in his trap.

500
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:24,208
She forgets herself,
and she forgets right from wrong.

501
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:30,208
She abandons all shame,
all that was good and true about her...

502
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:36,375
even her husband.

503
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:39,916
And then the unthinkable happens.

504
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:45,375
Her husband leaves her.

505
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,541
A nice story indeed.

506
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,125
Sister-in-law...

507
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:00,458
enough.

508
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:02,333
You made a mistake.

509
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:07,416
We'll assume... you were alone,

510
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,916
foolish,

511
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,166
and Sudip took advantage of it.

512
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:28,291
Just come right out and say it.
You're jealous of Sudip.

513
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,416
Sister-in-law, stop saying his name.

514
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,583
Sudip.

515
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:52,166
Sister-in-law...

516
01:04:54,541 --> 01:04:55,375
Sudip.

517
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,083
How you have changed!

518
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,541
I have written to your husband...

519
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:10,125
to ask for his advice.

520
01:05:14,666 --> 01:05:16,833
I don't think he will take you back,

521
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:23,625
but maybe... it would be best
to send you back to your family.

522
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:32,083
You are all the same.

523
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:21,750
Milord...

524
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:37,416
Doll.

525
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:40,666
Get up.

526
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:42,500
Get up!

527
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,916
Play, play.

528
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:22,541
Play!

529
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:24,708
No!

530
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:25,625
Play.

531
01:07:26,416 --> 01:07:27,458
Play!

532
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,333
Get up.

533
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:44,708
Get up.

534
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:46,500
Get up.

535
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,875
Get up! Get up!

536
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:58,583
Get up! Get up! Get up!

537
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,458
You have married into a royal family.

538
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:02,708
Why the tears?

539
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:05,750
Keep quiet.

540
01:11:08,041 --> 01:11:09,041
He's a little...

541
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:13,000
insane,

542
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:17,916
but he'll be fine after marriage.

543
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:21,583
He's a little insane,

544
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,083
but...

545
01:11:25,791 --> 01:11:27,166
he's of royal blood.

546
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:29,000
Keep quiet.

547
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,791
He's a little insane,

548
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:42,416
but you will be adorned in jewels.

549
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:46,750
He's a little insane, but...

550
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:49,958
you will be draped in silks.

551
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:53,375
You will get respect.

552
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,833
Keep quiet.

553
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:06,916
He's a little insane, but...

554
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,166
if not him, then his brother...

555
01:12:13,666 --> 01:12:14,875
will look after you.

556
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:43,291
Large manors have large secrets.

557
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:48,708
So keep quiet.

558
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:03,125
- How is she?
- She's regained consciousness.

559
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:19,250
I have told everyone
that they shouldn't touch your feet.

560
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:20,666
Careful.

561
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:26,125
You've lost so much blood.

562
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:50,500
Who did this?

563
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:04,625
I'm your doctor. You can trust me.

564
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,708
Then do your job and leave.

565
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:22,958
Milady.

566
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,166
Everything is ready for the prayer meet.

567
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,333
Prayer meet?

568
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:32,875
Prayers for Mahendra's death anniversary.

569
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:41,958
How can I forget?

570
01:14:43,291 --> 01:14:45,625
It's such a special day for us both.

571
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:39,208
Are you going somewhere?

572
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:42,625
Don't worry.

573
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:45,750
I won't do anything.

574
01:15:49,666 --> 01:15:51,375
The first time I met you,

575
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:54,791
I wanted to put
a bullet through you right then.

576
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:58,458
Now I know why.

577
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,916
Your fate will be decided
by the courts in Calcutta.

578
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:18,041
Last night my father threw out my mother
from the house last night.

579
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:19,916
His new wife made him do that,

580
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,250
and now look what my mother has done.

581
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:24,541
Where is your father?

582
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:27,083
He has taken Sir Satya.

583
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,000
Where?

584
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,291
Aren't you afraid?

585
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:43,166
Of what?

586
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:47,625
The consequences of your crimes.

587
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:54,458
You think you will get away with it.

588
01:16:56,916 --> 01:17:02,250
If it depends on the law, then yes.

589
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:07,000
- I suspect you...
- You suspect something entirely different,

590
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:10,583
but intend to punish me for another crime.

591
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:13,666
Although, there is a way.

592
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:19,000
I will believe
you are completely innocent...

593
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,958
if that Demon-Woman appears before us.

594
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,125
Driver?

595
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:41,583
Driver!

596
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,875
Don't move, or I'll shoot.

597
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:48,666
Driver.

598
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,166
Have you fallen asleep?

599
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:32,000
Straighten your feet.

600
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:34,291
How will you heal if you don't?

601
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:35,791
I have healed.

602
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:44,000
Milady.

603
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:55,208
- Milady?
- Doctor!

604
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,666
She was... She was here!

605
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:08,708
There is a witch.

606
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:12,166
We have to find her.

607
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:15,041
- Let's go.
- Go back home, Sire.

608
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:16,500
What?

609
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:19,000
Go back to your manor.

610
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:20,250
Why?

611
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:23,708
I'm not afraid of her.

612
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:25,625
If you are, you're welcome to leave.

613
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:27,250
At least we know...

614
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:30,791
you're innocent.

615
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:33,500
You can leave.

616
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,625
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to hunt her.

617
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:39,708
Sire, stop!

618
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,541
Why are you trying to stop me?

619
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:50,333
Why are you trying to save her?
Who is she to you?

620
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:55,208
She is just my friend,

621
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:57,833
but isn't she everything to you, your...

622
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,750
Why such fondness for a demon?

623
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:47,333
She's not a demon.

624
01:21:53,416 --> 01:21:54,250
She's a goddess.

625
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,708
<i>There's a witness, a little girl.</i>

626
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:10,125
<i>She was saying... the goddess killed him.</i>

627
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:40,500
<i>- Master Dinkar.
- A fine man.</i>

628
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:45,250
<i>His wife's broken bones
tell another story.</i>

629
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:02,458
<i>The goddess has not done right by me.</i>

630
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:06,291
<i>I was immersed in prayers
when the Demon-Woman killed Mahendra.</i>

631
01:23:53,541 --> 01:23:54,666
Milady!

632
01:23:56,083 --> 01:23:56,916
Milady!

633
01:23:58,916 --> 01:23:59,833
Milady!

634
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:51,375
What have you done?

635
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:24,000
<i>Why are you trying to save her?</i>

636
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:25,125
<i>What is she to you?</i>

637
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:27,666
<i>She is just my friend,</i>

638
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:29,791
<i>but isn't she everything to you,
your sister-in-law?</i>

639
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:35,583
<i>And it wasn't an animal.</i>

640
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,500
<i>- It's the work of a man.
- Why? Why not a woman?</i>

641
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:56,250
<i>One, two...</i>

642
01:25:57,625 --> 01:26:00,208
<i>Three, four...</i>

643
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:03,041
<i>Five, six...</i>

644
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:05,500
<i>Seven, eight...</i>

645
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:07,666
<i>Nine, ten...</i>

646
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,708
<i>Eleven, 12...</i>

647
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:11,625
<i>Thirteen, 14...</i>

648
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,166
<i>Dear brother...</i>

649
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:05,416
<i>I always thought that when I grew up,
I would like to be like you.</i>

650
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,875
<i>But I'm leaving this house forever...</i>

651
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,791
<i>because I'm afraid...</i>

652
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:13,083
<i>I might become like you.</i>

653
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:18,500
<i>Because I'm afraid...
I might already be like you.</i>

654
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:22,750
<i>Now we are literally related by blood:</i>

655
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:27,208
<i>the blood that has stained all our hands.</i>

656
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:31,416
<i>Now we are all the same.</i>

657
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:32,750
<i>Milord.</i>

658
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:49,750
<i>Milord.</i>

659
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:20,000
Bulbbul?
