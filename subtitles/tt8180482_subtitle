1
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:29,617
It's too dark, Dad.
Nothing is visible.

2
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:31,617
Open your eyes.

3
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:38,337
Alby, we should see
only through this.

4
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:40,457
No, Dad.
This is really frightening.

5
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,337
Why do you feel so?

6
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:43,617
Trust your dad.

7
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:47,137
But Ms. Mercy told me
not to go out today.

8
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:51,097
I know that you will obey her

9
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:52,577
as she is your favourite.

10
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:56,057
But who teaches you science?
- You.

11
00:01:58,177 --> 00:01:59,217
Isn't it?

12
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:03,937
Then, you must obey me when
it comes to matters like this.

13
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:05,977
Okay, Dad.

14
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:36,817
Dad,
what if the moon doesn't move?

15
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:38,217
It will be dark, isn't it?

16
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:41,137
Such a dumb question,
isn't it, Dad?

17
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:45,897
There are no dumb questions
when it comes to science.

18
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:47,977
Science got its answers
to several complicated questions

19
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,777
because of such dumb questions.

20
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:54,537
You should never stop
asking questions.

21
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:56,937
You shouldn't stop
until you get an answer.

22
00:02:57,497 --> 00:02:58,497
Do you get it?
- Yes.

23
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:07,137
Do you know how big
this universe is

24
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:09,257
and how tiny human beings are,
compared to it?

25
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,257
What's the name of the galaxy
of which Earth is a part of?

26
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:14,097
Milky way.
- Correct.

27
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:18,097
Earth is just a small planet
in the milky way.

28
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:21,137
It is said that there
are more than

29
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:23,217
twenty thousand crore
such galaxies in this universe.

30
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,217
Huh! Do human beings inhabit
all of them?

31
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:27,097
Albert Einstein
had said this once

32
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:29,497
that for human beings,
the universe

33
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:32,657
is just like a big library
is for a toddler.

34
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:34,937
Huge book shelves
full of tomes

35
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:37,617
written in strange languages
beyond his understanding.

36
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:41,137
The toddler doesn't know
how to read them.

37
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:44,457
So, he can't find out
the mystery behind all that.

38
00:03:45,177 --> 00:03:47,817
Dad, when I grow up

39
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,177
I'll become a great scientist.

40
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:52,297
We need not become a scientist
to know more

41
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:53,737
about the things around us.

42
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:57,457
As I said,
you must keep asking questions.

43
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:01,537
After some time,
people around us will say

44
00:04:01,577 --> 00:04:03,617
that not all questions
have an answer.

45
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:05,537
That's a lie.

46
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:08,577
Look up at the sky, Albert.

47
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:12,377
You'll get answers to all
your questions from there.

48
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:25,777
'Saint Antony's UP School,
Plassanal.'

49
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:43,057
Ms. Mercy.

50
00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:48,657
Ma'am, can you please seal this
and post it?

51
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:50,257
I am not quite sure
about the address.

52
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:52,017
Please send it to ISRC.

53
00:04:55,857 --> 00:04:56,857
Ma'am, please don't forget.

54
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:08,537
'Scientists have announced
that a super comet'

55
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:11,497
'capable of causing
massive destruction'

56
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:12,937
'is nearing the surface
of Earth.'

57
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:14,537
'Only few days are left'

58
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:17,217
'and everyone around the world
are bustling with anxiety.'

59
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:19,577
'In several countries,
the panic-stricken masses'

60
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:20,817
'have started organised riots.'

61
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,337
'There is chaos
across the globe.'

62
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:27,817
'Until Friday..'

63
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:29,577
'An aerospace is globally..'

64
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:33,337
'Was shut down for 24 hours.'

65
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:34,457
'All the metropolitan cities'

66
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,577
'are under tight security
and surveillance.'

67
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,377
'Under the impact
of its magnetic field'

68
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:40,337
'the world will be bereft
of electricity for nine days.'

69
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,697
I'm sorry to have
called you today.

70
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:52,577
This can't go on like this.

71
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:53,817
See this?

72
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:55,937
Last day, my son returned home
in this state.

73
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:57,377
Had the impact been
a little lower

74
00:05:57,577 --> 00:05:58,537
he would've been blinded.

75
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:00,337
Your son hurled a stone at him.

76
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:02,817
I'm.. Sorry.

77
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:08,297
Father, please give him
one last chance.. - Albert!

78
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:10,297
I'm answerable to other parents
as well.

79
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,977
I'm expelling Adam
from this school.

80
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,577
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:28,537
Come, get in the car.

82
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:36,977
It's your mid-term.

83
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:39,097
Which school will admit you now?

84
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:41,537
Moreover, will any school be ready
to admit you?

85
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:44,137
What should I write
in your reference letter?

86
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,177
That you're good at pelting stones
at other kids!

87
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:49,817
Adam, why can't you just
be normal?

88
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:51,697
Do you at least have a friend?

89
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:53,737
Does anyone play with you?

90
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:57,057
I'm fed up.

91
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:00,817
I miss my mother.

92
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:04,377
How can you miss someone
whom you never met?

93
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:06,137
I've told you several times

94
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:07,817
that you've only me
as a parent.

95
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:09,497
Do you hear that?
I'm all you have!

96
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:12,097
You're not my mother..

97
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:13,897
Hey, Adam..

98
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:18,017
Do you feel any pain?

99
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:21,177
No. - Do you feel
a weight to your head?

100
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:23,417
Yes, maybe because
I cried the other day.

101
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,497
You're completely all right.

102
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:26,577
No problem at all.

103
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:28,457
Come.

104
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:33,297
You've grown up, Adam.

105
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:35,137
I'm not even able
to lift you up.

106
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:36,177
Okay, big boy.

107
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:38,297
Now, you must help your father.

108
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,017
Don't be mad at anyone.

109
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,057
Be friendly towards everyone.

110
00:07:42,457 --> 00:07:44,417
And study well.

111
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,337
And become a great
astrophysicist like your dad.

112
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:49,697
Dad is angry at me.

113
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:52,377
For now, yes.
But that will change with time

114
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:53,857
as he is your dad.

115
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,937
You mean the world to him.

116
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:02,497
How is he?
- He is fine now.

117
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:03,657
He is a bit upset.

118
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,897
He is just a little kid.

119
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:06,417
Some kids who don't get
their mother's love

120
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:07,537
become a little problematic.

121
00:08:07,857 --> 00:08:08,697
It's quite common.

122
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:12,257
Albert, you must handle him
more softly.

123
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,657
And moreover, try to spend
some time with him

124
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:17,057
no matter how busy you are.

125
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:19,057
That will put an end
to all his problems.

126
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:21,657
Rahul, I know, but sometimes
it's really tough to manage him.

127
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:22,977
I know..

128
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:27,097
'I'll have to interrupt you.'

129
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,897
'We'll have global blackouts
for nine days.'

130
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:31,857
Two more weeks, right?

131
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,297
So, what do you think?

132
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:34,417
Will the world end?

133
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,777
We don't need a comet
for that.

134
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,137
Human beings will bring
the world to an end one day.

135
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:01,417
Sir.
- Sir.

136
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:02,777
You were right.
- Good morning, sir.

137
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:03,937
Readings are spot on.

138
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:06,617
As of now, any probability
for the debris to drop

139
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:09,377
is somewhere
over the Indo-Chinese border.

140
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,897
Didn't you two go home
last day? - No, sir.

141
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:13,817
See, in terms of space research

142
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:16,137
this comet is passing
too close to Earth.

143
00:09:16,617 --> 00:09:19,417
But in terms of actual distance,
it is too much.

144
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,097
So, the debris might
make it through

145
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:24,737
but most probably, it will drop
in the ocean.

146
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:26,857
Right, sir. - This time
should be no different.

147
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:28,737
Sir, everything okay?
- Yes.

148
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:30,937
All fine. - We know
what tomorrow means to you.

149
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:32,777
Must be tough.
You could've taken a day off.

150
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,337
No, that won't work out.

151
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,777
Coming to the office is better

152
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:37,697
than sitting at home
and bothering.

153
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:39,457
My sister can babysit
your son if needed.

154
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:41,297
I'll talk to her.
- That's not needed.

155
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,017
I've a maid at home.
My son will be fine.

156
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:44,257
Sir, did you get the news

157
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,377
that our former chairman

158
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:47,617
Dr. Inyath Khan
has reached Delhi?

159
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,257
Yes, I got to know.

160
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:51,297
This year, it is him
who is going to lead

161
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:52,737
the government advisory panel,
right? - Yes.

162
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:55,217
There is a rumour that he
might be visiting our office.

163
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,897
Did he call you up?
As you're his favourite student.

164
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:59,097
No, usually, he never
gets in touch.

165
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:00,777
A surprise visit
is in the cards.

166
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:03,377
As he is a recluse
with no email or phone.

167
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,417
For the past five years,
he was off the radar

168
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:07,657
using the excuse of setting up
a research centre in Brazil.

169
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:10,857
With genius, comes a spark
of madness as well.

170
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:12,457
But what a man!

171
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:13,657
He is a Noble Prize winner.

172
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:14,737
Honoured with Padma Vibhushan.

173
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,657
A leading cosmologist
in the world.

174
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:19,617
Sir, do give me a chance
to meet him someday.

175
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:20,937
I just want to take
a selfie with him.

176
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:23,657
After working for five years
as his assistant

177
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,417
I couldn't get photographed
with him.

178
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:26,657
And you need a selfie!

179
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:29,177
Right, can I get to work now?
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sure, sir.

180
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:30,577
Have a nice day, sir.
- You too.

181
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:40,857
Happy birthday, Adam.

182
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:42,217
Thank you, Dad.

183
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:08,937
"Oh, graceful God,
up in the skies."

184
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:12,777
"The gloom of death
looms large here.."

185
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:16,297
"Bless us to soar higher,
leaving all that behind.."

186
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:19,577
"On the judgement day"

187
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:21,577
"beaming with the pride
of victory.."

188
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:47,097
James.

189
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,177
James.

190
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,417
Do we really need to behave
like strangers?

191
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:59,617
My sister's death anniversary
is not something that I can avoid.

192
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:03,777
Usually, my family and I try
to avoid visiting places

193
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:06,417
where you and your son
are present.

194
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:09,497
He is just a kid, James.

195
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:11,697
Is such a punishment necessary?

196
00:12:12,537 --> 00:12:14,177
Albert, it's my son who
is enduring the punishment.

197
00:12:14,497 --> 00:12:15,697
Since last one year

198
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,217
he has been restricted
to that wheelchair.

199
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:19,537
His chances of walking again..

200
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:23,417
Do you know something?

201
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,017
I don't recall a night,
going to bed

202
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:28,097
without hearing Lissy's
muffled sobs.

203
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:32,297
Sometimes, I wish
for him to be dead!

204
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:35,777
It's okay.

205
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:38,217
Your son is totally fine.

206
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:41,377
That's more than enough.

207
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:44,937
That was an accident, James.
He didn't do that on purpose..

208
00:12:44,937 --> 00:12:45,937
Shoving my son
off the terrace

209
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:48,577
for a petty argument,
you call that an accident?

210
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,377
We witnessed it, James.

211
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:53,097
When Alex was about to fall
off the parapet

212
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:54,617
Adam tried to save..
- Lie!

213
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:57,177
You don't know your son
that well, Albert.

214
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,617
He..

215
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:03,297
We were really happy when Annie
told that she wanted to marry you.

216
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,457
Your financial background
or family status..

217
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:06,777
Nothing mattered to us.

218
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:08,697
I liked you, Albert.

219
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:09,817
Like my own brother.

220
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:12,577
But your son,
he killed my Annie first.

221
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:14,897
Then he shattered my son's life.

222
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:20,377
You've been suffering
ever since he was born.

223
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:22,057
Take it from me.

224
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,977
As long as he is alive

225
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:27,617
you won't live a life
of happiness and peace.

226
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:29,577
He!

227
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,537
He is evil.

228
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,017
James.

229
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,017
"Happy birthday to you."

230
00:13:48,217 --> 00:13:51,177
"Happy birthday to you."

231
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,577
"Happy birthday, dear Adam."

232
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,937
"Happy birthday to you."

233
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:04,097
James has not changed at all,
right?

234
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:09,337
His hatred and anger is
growing with time, it seems.

235
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:12,697
What about Adam?
How did he take it?

236
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:16,297
He didn't hear, it seems.

237
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:19,057
Or perhaps, he pretended
that he didn't hear anything.

238
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:23,417
Isn't it one of the most brutal
of God's silly pranks?

239
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:26,137
A mother's death
while delivering her baby.

240
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:30,017
The whole family is confused
whether to celebrate

241
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:32,337
or grieve on that day,
throughout their entire lives.

242
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:34,137
It has been seven years.

243
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:35,697
Seven years.

244
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:37,057
That's a long time.

245
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,137
I won't ask you to get married
for Adam's sake.

246
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,617
But you need a partner, right?

247
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:45,617
Shall we find another Annie?

248
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:49,817
Another Annie.

249
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:55,657
Isn't that the problem?

250
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,377
There is no one like her.

251
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:36,457
Please sit down.

252
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:41,017
When it was announced
that my lecture

253
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:43,617
was shifted from classroom
to auditorium

254
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:47,217
I wasn't expecting a sudden surge
of interest in astrophysics.

255
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:51,497
Anyway, I got to know
that students of other courses

256
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:52,537
are also present here.

257
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:54,337
So, I guess, there is no point
in taking today's class

258
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:56,177
based on the curriculum.

259
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:58,937
Shall we have a question
and answer session?

260
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:00,577
You may ask questions.

261
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:03,377
I'll answer your question
if I know the answer.

262
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:04,817
What do you say?

263
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:07,737
Lights.

264
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:12,417
I will answer the first question
before you even ask.

265
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:16,297
This won't lead
to the end of the world.

266
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:19,497
Something we never experienced..

267
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,017
We are going to experience it.

268
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:21,937
That's about it.

269
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:23,457
As far as you all are concerned

270
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:27,697
it'll be nine days without internet
and social media platforms.

271
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,777
Sir, where is this comet's origin?

272
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:31,297
From the unknown.

273
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:33,177
From an unknown galaxy

274
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:35,737
which we haven't explored yet.

275
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:37,897
To put it in perspective

276
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,217
a comet bigger
than Mount Everest

277
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:42,137
is going to pass,
close to the surface of Earth.

278
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:44,097
And there will be a solar flare.

279
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:47,377
As the news channels reported

280
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:51,417
this comet has
a strong electromagnetic field.

281
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,937
I mean, it has
a strong electromagnetic pulse.

282
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:56,937
The comet's powerful EMP

283
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:59,857
will influence
Earth's electromagnetic field.

284
00:17:00,257 --> 00:17:02,657
Everything that makes use
of electric energy

285
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:05,377
be it
huge hydrothermal plants

286
00:17:05,577 --> 00:17:07,697
or our mobiles phones
and watches..

287
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,137
All of that will stop working.

288
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,777
This magnetic field, which is
more powerful than Earth's EMP

289
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:15,737
will gradually lose its strength
and after nine days

290
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:17,457
it will vanish completely.

291
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,977
Until then, all of us will
be under its influence.

292
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:24,817
The world will be
in an electromagnetic bubble.

293
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:27,057
Sir, there are many
conspiracy theories

294
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:28,737
about that in the Internet.

295
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:31,897
Sure, there are several theories.

296
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:34,257
It's up to our common sense
to find out

297
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:35,617
if any conspiracy
is involved or not.

298
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:38,017
One comet's debris is still
on the face of Earth

299
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,177
under the Bermuda Triangle,
according to a theory.

300
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:43,657
The theory says
that its EMP is still active.

301
00:17:43,777 --> 00:17:46,177
According to some,
aircrafts and ships stop receiving

302
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:48,857
the satellite signals
and meet with an accident

303
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:49,897
because of that.

304
00:17:50,097 --> 00:17:50,977
I've a question.

305
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:56,017
What do you've to say regarding
the most famous conspiracy theory?

306
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,457
Are comets actually messages
from the aliens?

307
00:18:01,377 --> 00:18:02,657
Since ancient times,
human beings

308
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:05,377
have considered celestial bodies
with a sense of foreboding.

309
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:07,057
Especially comets.

310
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:09,297
They are messengers
of destruction

311
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,897
according to a popular conception.

312
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:13,497
Using prayers and other forms
of rituals

313
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:14,857
they tried to defend it.

314
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:18,057
We've always been afraid
of phenomena

315
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,417
that are beyond
our understanding.

316
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:20,537
If you ask me

317
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:22,697
you must not approach

318
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:24,657
the next nine days with fear.

319
00:18:25,297 --> 00:18:28,497
Be proud of getting a chance
to witness something historical.

320
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,617
A similar phenomenon
will be repeated

321
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,137
only after millions of years
from now.

322
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:37,537
Before this, such a special comet
had passed so close to Earth

323
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,097
when Julius Caesar was still
building his Roman empire.

324
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:44,057
We, especially you guys

325
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:45,497
must consider this
as an opportunity.

326
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:47,937
An opportunity
to experience a phase of time

327
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:49,417
which you had heard
only as a fable.

328
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:51,097
Social media

329
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:54,137
movies, music,
cars, bikes..

330
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:55,697
Nothing will work.

331
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:59,497
All that you will be left with
are sunrise, sunset

332
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:02,217
wind, rain and nature.

333
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:06,577
Let these nine days
teach you how to socialise

334
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:09,577
without the help of social media.

335
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:11,257
For nine days..

336
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:13,297
At least, for these nine days

337
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:15,737
let's be human again.

338
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:27,657
'For your convenience,
we have an outdoor stall..'

339
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:28,737
It's 3 a.m.

340
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:29,817
Such a big crowd.

341
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,417
Nowadays, it's open
for 24 hours.

342
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,897
It's a lot more busier
during the day time.

343
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:37,337
'That stall is open
for your convenience.'

344
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:40,497
'So, after finishing
your purchase..'

345
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:45,257
Look, candles, match stick,
kerosene lamps..

346
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:48,137
As if an old era is on sale..

347
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:57,457
They're afraid they will run out
of food and essentials.

348
00:19:58,177 --> 00:19:59,257
Hence, this sense of panic.

349
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:01,057
Sir, will we face issues
in getting the supplies?

350
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:03,817
Won't there be a way to transport
essentials to the market?

351
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,577
How?

352
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:06,937
For that, we need vehicles

353
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:08,937
with thermal
or mechanical engines.

354
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:11,697
Engines with spark plugs
or compression

355
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:13,097
won't even start.

356
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:15,177
How do we get those old vehicles?

357
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,937
Even trains
that use steam engines

358
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:18,217
can be found only
in the museums.

359
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,937
We got rid of our old toys
when we got new ones.

360
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:24,697
Everyone is so busy,
collecting the essentials.

361
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:27,057
The problems that people
are about to face

362
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:28,857
during the next nine days..

363
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,577
People living in the cities
are panicking more.

364
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:34,537
Their lives have been turned
upside down.

365
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,577
Can we even imagine
spending a day

366
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:40,297
without electricity
and internet?

367
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:43,737
We can't even return
to the villages

368
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:45,297
as they don't exist
anymore.

369
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:47,217
Not just us.

370
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:49,937
The entire world
is facing this.

371
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,617
Humanity will be tested
in these nine days.

372
00:20:59,537 --> 00:21:01,537
Sir, how will we shop
as it's such a huge crowd?

373
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:02,897
Leave it.

374
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,177
The owner of this hypermarket
is my friend.

375
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,817
Send me a list
of items you need.

376
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,377
I'll try to get it delivered
to your houses.

377
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:10,377
Thank you, sir.
- 'Candles, lamps'

378
00:21:10,577 --> 00:21:12,137
'oil, etc. are available.'

379
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:15,897
'We request all of you..
- It's the end of the world..'

380
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:20,137
'This comet symbolises
the end of the world.'

381
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:25,097
'Join us.
- Join us..'

382
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:46,177
Oh, no!

383
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:57,937
I didn't see that.

384
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:04,617
Adam, come..

385
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,057
Let me have a look at you.

386
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:10,697
You were a baby
when I saw you last time.

387
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:12,577
You're a big man now.

388
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:13,697
Even you look old.

389
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:15,817
You got it right.

390
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:17,937
Come, let's go meet your dad.

391
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:20,977
Look, I won't tell him
about the flower vase.

392
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:22,217
Deal?

393
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:24,137
Come.

394
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:33,097
Adam, enough.
Come inside.

395
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:35,457
You might be celebrating
your rustication..

396
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:37,217
Doctor Khan.

397
00:22:37,377 --> 00:22:38,377
Hi, Albert.

398
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:44,057
You haven't changed at all.

399
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:45,697
You look still the same.

400
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:49,937
Nothing changes much
after a certain age.

401
00:22:50,857 --> 00:22:52,537
Even you've got some grey hair.

402
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,017
You haven't forgotten
Malayalam yet, right?'

403
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:57,457
That's the benefit
of learning languages.

404
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,937
Once we get used
to talking in a language

405
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:04,297
how do I put it..
It gets hold of you.

406
00:23:05,377 --> 00:23:07,297
I was here for ten..
No.

407
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,617
I was here for 15 years.

408
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:13,057
I haven't seen you
since a long time.

409
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:15,217
Six years.

410
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:18,057
We last met on
Annie's first death anniversary.

411
00:23:19,057 --> 00:23:20,217
Annie.

412
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:21,937
She was a gem.

413
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:23,177
Indeed.

414
00:23:24,377 --> 00:23:26,017
Yes.
To Annie.

415
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:29,937
Annie.

416
00:23:29,937 --> 00:23:30,977
Cheers.

417
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:37,377
Albert.

418
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,537
This is not a courtesy visit.

419
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:43,617
I came here to give you
a task.

420
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,017
Okay.

421
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,097
Have you ever been
to the mountains?

422
00:23:49,577 --> 00:23:51,737
Two years back,
for a convention in Munnar..

423
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:53,417
Not those mountains.

424
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:54,897
The big daddy.

425
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:56,257
Himalayas.

426
00:23:58,097 --> 00:23:59,057
No.

427
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:00,657
Heaven on Earth.

428
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:03,177
I've a holiday home there.

429
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:06,057
It was an old heritage hotel.

430
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,177
Four years back

431
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:10,537
I bought it
out of a crazy impulse.

432
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:15,377
I'd promised Time magazine
to write an article for them.

433
00:24:16,097 --> 00:24:20,097
About the comet and
its socio-cultural implications.

434
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,537
But then, I got
an official invite

435
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:23,817
from the Chinese government.

436
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:25,857
A seminar involving

437
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:29,297
renowned cosmologists
and astronomers..

438
00:24:29,697 --> 00:24:31,457
And most of them
are very close friends of mine.

439
00:24:31,577 --> 00:24:32,857
And the plan is..

440
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:36,577
We'll observe the comet live
from the seminar location.

441
00:24:37,657 --> 00:24:40,777
I can't afford to miss that.

442
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:42,857
So, I came here to tell you
that on my behalf

443
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:45,937
you'll do the data collection
and research for that article.

444
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:48,577
On the cover of Time Magazine

445
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:51,417
your name will be featured
as the co-author.

446
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:52,657
Come on.

447
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:54,777
How long are you planning
to be in this job?

448
00:24:55,257 --> 00:24:56,497
People should know you.

449
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:58,217
Time will put you
on the map.

450
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,137
Sir, but do I need
to go there for that?

451
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,737
I can do the same
from here as well, right?

452
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:05,577
This is why I like you so much.

453
00:25:06,177 --> 00:25:08,777
You always ask
the right question. Sit.

454
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:13,337
Albert, don't consider it
just as a place.

455
00:25:14,377 --> 00:25:17,737
It's one of the ancient corners
of this world.

456
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:21,497
And those mountains
have such tales to tell you.

457
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:26,017
A village full of rituals
and all kinds of superstitions..

458
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:29,377
There are two tribal groups
and their perennial battle

459
00:25:29,617 --> 00:25:30,577
inside the forest.

460
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:35,577
We've an ancient Buddhist monastery
which maintains peace.

461
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,657
Both the tribal groups
have united now.

462
00:25:40,217 --> 00:25:42,097
There is only one emotion
behind it.

463
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:43,657
Fear.

464
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:45,737
Fear instilled by the comet.

465
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:50,537
But they are not the only ones
who fear that comet.

466
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,897
In a way,
everybody is scared of it.

467
00:25:53,737 --> 00:25:57,057
They knew about this comet
millions of years

468
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:58,497
before the scientific world.

469
00:25:58,577 --> 00:26:01,177
On the walls of their caves
are written the ancient scriptures

470
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:04,937
stating the passing
of another red comet ages ago

471
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,217
and its imminent return.

472
00:26:08,057 --> 00:26:09,017
And you know what.

473
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:11,297
Their prediction was spot on.

474
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:15,137
And now, the red comet
is going to come again

475
00:26:16,137 --> 00:26:17,737
on the very day
that they predicted

476
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,817
millions of years back.

477
00:26:20,697 --> 00:26:23,937
That is one
of the very few places

478
00:26:24,177 --> 00:26:26,537
from where we can witness
that comet.

479
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:31,217
You can see her there.

480
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,297
Once the comet passes

481
00:26:34,777 --> 00:26:39,577
the sky will turn red,
owing to the comet's glow

482
00:26:40,777 --> 00:26:42,417
for the whole nine days.

483
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:45,937
Exactly how the paintings
inside those caves depicted.

484
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:49,017
And that's why they are scared.

485
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:51,297
What do you say?

486
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:53,297
Of course, I'll do it, sir.

487
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:54,857
Good.

488
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:56,417
It will be a change
for Adam as well.

489
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:59,137
There is a lot of space
for him to play football.

490
00:26:59,657 --> 00:27:00,817
You'll have a caretaker.

491
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:01,737
His name is Hakka.

492
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:03,097
He is a native.

493
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,977
He will take care of everything
including cooking.

494
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:09,377
I'll arrange everything
that you want.

495
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:11,377
Form a team

496
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:13,457
and plan the travel
as soon as possible.

497
00:27:13,857 --> 00:27:16,297
I'll be there
on the eighth day.

498
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:20,537
But how will you travel
during this span?

499
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:22,737
I've my ways, my son.

500
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:24,377
I've my ways.

501
00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:58,137
Doctor Inyath Khan.

502
00:27:58,337 --> 00:27:59,257
Really?

503
00:27:59,337 --> 00:28:01,137
Yes, the one and only.

504
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:03,297
He told me to assemble
a team for research.

505
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:07,737
I need two of you, only
if you guys are interested.

506
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:09,737
I'm ready.
- So am I, sir.

507
00:28:10,377 --> 00:28:11,337
Good.

508
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:13,457
Two employees
of ISA Delhi will join us.

509
00:28:13,617 --> 00:28:14,857
That makes a team of four.

510
00:28:15,137 --> 00:28:17,857
I suppose that is enough
for this assignment.

511
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:20,737
Do you guys have jackets
and woollen sweaters?

512
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:22,497
If not, you've to but it

513
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,297
because we'll leave
in two days.

514
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:57,337
Greetings. - Hakka.
- Yes.

515
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:58,417
I've kept your belongings
in your room, sir.

516
00:29:58,577 --> 00:29:59,577
Thank you.

517
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:03,297
Is this hotel still operating?
- No, sir.

518
00:30:03,577 --> 00:30:05,817
For now, it's nothing
but Mr. Khan's guest house.

519
00:30:06,577 --> 00:30:09,697
Once in a blue moon, his friends
or his guests comes here.

520
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:11,217
Okay.

521
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,297
So, guys, this is..
- Ibrahim Naaz, IIT Kanpur.

522
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,617
Hi, I'm Sandeep.
- Divya.

523
00:30:41,697 --> 00:30:44,297
Neerav Vatekar, IIT Guwahati.
- Hello, I'm Sandeep.

524
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:48,497
It was tough, sir.

525
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:50,017
But I managed
to get the rooms.

526
00:30:50,297 --> 00:30:51,297
Almost all places
must be brimming

527
00:30:51,457 --> 00:30:53,137
with people who are here
to see the comet.

528
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:55,217
I'm insisting once again.
You guys can stay with me.

529
00:30:55,257 --> 00:30:56,697
There is a lot of room
over there.

530
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:58,737
Okay, if that's the case..
- No need, sir.

531
00:30:58,777 --> 00:31:00,937
If we come there,
you'll transform it into an office.

532
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:03,457
Adam needs some leisure time
with you, in the evenings.

533
00:31:03,497 --> 00:31:04,457
He needs it.

534
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:31,937
That is an observation post,
abandoned by the army

535
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:35,057
after the war of 1962.
We can set up the tents.

536
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:36,897
Don't get used to it, guys.

537
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:39,617
Only for the next nine days
do we have this office space.

538
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:43,217
After that, it is again going to be
glass houses in concrete jungles.

539
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,097
Step down.

540
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:03,937
The headlights won't work.

541
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:06,137
So, in order to light a fire..

542
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,377
Right.

543
00:32:36,257 --> 00:32:38,737
I am keeping the Landcruiser
for myself.

544
00:32:38,977 --> 00:32:40,497
This one was converted
into a right-hand drive

545
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:42,057
at a local workshop.

546
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:44,697
An old 43-model Willys
was restored to make this.

547
00:32:45,177 --> 00:32:48,457
I've jotted down the instructions
to install a manual crank-shaft.

548
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:50,137
Okay.
- Will you guys be able to manage

549
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,257
or should I help?
- Sir, well..

550
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:53,617
We'll manage, sir.

551
00:32:54,977 --> 00:32:55,937
Good.

552
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:10,857
Sleep well tonight.

553
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,457
Because tomorrow, she comes.

554
00:33:16,697 --> 00:33:20,817
After that, we won't have time
to rest.

555
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,057
Away from all..

556
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:54,537
A haven, away from everyone.

557
00:33:56,897 --> 00:33:58,777
You would've loved
this place, Annie.

558
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:27,257
"Like a glimmering star,
won't you come to me, my dear?"

559
00:34:28,177 --> 00:34:35,057
"With your gorgeous smile,
light up my days and nights.."

560
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:39,457
"After a long wait
that spanned ages"

561
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:43,457
"I met you at the crossroads."

562
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:47,417
"Though you defined my life"

563
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:52,377
"why did you fade away
in an instant?"

564
00:34:56,217 --> 00:35:03,777
"Like a glimmering star,
won't you come to me, my dear?"

565
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:11,097
"With your gorgeous smile,
light up my days and nights.."

566
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:14,817
"I've fallen for you, dear."

567
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:18,897
"All my dreams revolve
around you now."

568
00:35:19,057 --> 00:35:22,817
"I don't want to spend
a moment away from you."

569
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:26,857
"Never apart from you, dear.."

570
00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:30,817
"I've fallen for you, dear."

571
00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:34,817
"All my dreams revolve
around you now."

572
00:35:34,977 --> 00:35:38,857
"I don't want to spend
a moment away from you."

573
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:43,257
"Never apart from you, dear.."

574
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:24,137
"Never shall we be apart,
so you whispered in my ears.."

575
00:36:24,497 --> 00:36:31,657
"Forgetting all that,
you're drifting away from me.."

576
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:39,937
"Like an ephemeral rainbow,
you were gone.."

577
00:36:40,297 --> 00:36:47,097
"As my eyes well up,
I yearn for you.."

578
00:36:47,257 --> 00:36:51,017
"Life seems to be too long."

579
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:54,937
"Am I searching for you
in vain?"

580
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:59,057
"The pain of your separation
scorches me"

581
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:03,257
"tears just trickle down
to form a river."

582
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:09,457
"After a long wait
that spanned ages"

583
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:13,537
"I met you at the crossroads."

584
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:17,417
"Though you defined my life"

585
00:37:17,617 --> 00:37:21,417
"why did you fade away
in an instant?"

586
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:29,297
"Like a glimmering star.."

587
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:34,817
Just the two of us hanging out
won't last for long, Albert.

588
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:36,937
What?

589
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:40,857
I'm pregnant.

590
00:38:29,937 --> 00:38:30,937
Good night, Annie.

591
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:51,497
I'm not a man for words.

592
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:56,137
But today, we're about to witness
a historic event!

593
00:38:56,737 --> 00:38:58,937
We're at the right place,
at the right time.

594
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,417
Keep your eyes on the sky, guys.

595
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:03,257
It only happens once.

596
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:07,497
We've three optical telescopes
to watch the passing comet.

597
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:11,617
You may use this watch tower.
- What about you, sir?

598
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:13,897
I've a spot in my mind.

599
00:43:11,537 --> 00:43:12,617
Hello.

600
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:31,057
Hello..

601
00:44:37,897 --> 00:44:39,057
She is quite sick.

602
00:44:39,457 --> 00:44:41,177
If she doesn't wake up
by tomorrow morning

603
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:42,857
we would've to call the doctor.

604
00:44:43,777 --> 00:44:45,817
Hakka, you may leave.
We're good.

605
00:44:47,297 --> 00:44:49,817
I'll come tomorrow morning
and prepare breakfast.

606
00:45:03,097 --> 00:45:04,577
The comet's trail.

607
00:45:09,537 --> 00:45:10,577
Don't be afraid, Hakka.

608
00:45:11,177 --> 00:45:12,617
It won't bother us a bit.

609
00:45:13,697 --> 00:45:15,097
It's a bad omen, sir.

610
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:17,057
Extremely ominous.

611
00:46:40,977 --> 00:46:43,297
Adam, why are you here?

612
00:46:43,777 --> 00:46:45,697
Go on, go to bed.

613
00:47:07,097 --> 00:47:09,937
Adam, when did you wake up?

614
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:12,057
Go brush your teeth, come on.

615
00:47:38,537 --> 00:47:39,657
Who are you?

616
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,337
Where am I?

617
00:47:43,177 --> 00:47:45,417
Who are you?
Where am I?

618
00:47:45,537 --> 00:47:48,137
Don't worry.
You're safe here.

619
00:47:49,137 --> 00:47:52,817
I saw you in the woods
near Baruva last night.

620
00:47:53,177 --> 00:47:55,097
You ran into me.

621
00:47:55,337 --> 00:47:57,177
It was too cold and snowing.

622
00:47:57,497 --> 00:48:00,497
I couldn't just abandon you
in such a state, could I?

623
00:48:05,337 --> 00:48:07,417
I've a bad headache.

624
00:48:08,777 --> 00:48:11,337
I'm surprised that it's
only a headache.

625
00:48:12,737 --> 00:48:15,457
So, how did you get here?
What's your story?

626
00:48:19,177 --> 00:48:21,177
Ava, that's my name.

627
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:23,657
I'm coming from Delhi.

628
00:48:24,297 --> 00:48:26,497
I had few friends with me.

629
00:48:27,377 --> 00:48:31,057
I thought I'd get a good view
of the comet from the valley.

630
00:48:31,937 --> 00:48:33,937
A huge crowd had assembled there.

631
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:38,097
Few of us, stepped aside
from the crowd

632
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:39,857
and went into the woods.

633
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,777
While we were searching
for a good view point

634
00:48:45,377 --> 00:48:47,097
I lost my way.

635
00:48:47,537 --> 00:48:48,817
I was so scared!

636
00:48:49,817 --> 00:48:53,457
All of a sudden, I felt an object
hitting the ground!

637
00:48:56,057 --> 00:48:57,417
That's all I remember.

638
00:49:00,497 --> 00:49:03,577
What actually hit the ground
was a piece of the comet.

639
00:49:04,337 --> 00:49:08,377
That hitting the surface of Earth,
happens once in several eons.

640
00:49:09,417 --> 00:49:12,977
But what is even more surprising
is that you survived the accident.

641
00:49:13,857 --> 00:49:15,137
At that instant..

642
00:49:15,697 --> 00:49:17,657
I don't know if you
were fully conscious

643
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:21,977
but you deposited a piece
of comet in your bag.

644
00:49:23,937 --> 00:49:25,617
As it was too hot

645
00:49:25,857 --> 00:49:28,297
your bag and the items in it
were burned.

646
00:49:28,937 --> 00:49:32,577
Why did I deposit it in my bag?
- Exactly.

647
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,297
Why?

648
00:49:45,097 --> 00:49:46,337
You've a fever.

649
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:49,377
You may rest here
until you recover.

650
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:51,537
I've to go to a place.

651
00:49:51,937 --> 00:49:53,897
My caretaker, Hakka, is here.

652
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:57,497
If you need anything,
let him know. Okay?

653
00:50:01,777 --> 00:50:03,537
My son, Adam..

654
00:50:04,097 --> 00:50:05,457
He is bit naughty.

655
00:50:05,857 --> 00:50:09,297
I'll tell him. But in case,
he comes this way

656
00:50:09,657 --> 00:50:11,777
just ignore him.
- Thank you.

657
00:50:12,617 --> 00:50:13,857
Take rest.

658
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:30,457
Please go to the base camp

659
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:31,577
and tell my assistants
that I won't be coming today.

660
00:50:31,617 --> 00:50:32,817
Ask them to get started
with the work

661
00:50:32,857 --> 00:50:34,177
and I'll be there tomorrow.
Okay?

662
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:41,377
Adam.

663
00:50:43,017 --> 00:50:44,337
I'm going somewhere.

664
00:50:44,657 --> 00:50:47,057
That girl is not well,
she is taking rest.

665
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:51,337
So, don't go into her room and
disturb her when I'm not around.

666
00:50:51,497 --> 00:50:52,497
Okay?

667
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:54,177
Bye.

668
00:54:17,777 --> 00:54:18,777
Who are you?

669
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:20,377
What?

670
00:54:22,497 --> 00:54:25,617
Adam.. I know.

671
00:54:26,377 --> 00:54:28,297
Your dad told me about you.

672
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:33,337
It's rude to stare at someone.

673
00:54:37,017 --> 00:54:38,257
What's that in your hand?

674
00:54:38,937 --> 00:54:41,057
My flipbook.
- Let me take a look.

675
00:54:41,097 --> 00:54:42,137
Show me.

676
00:54:46,737 --> 00:54:48,137
Who all are in this?

677
00:54:48,377 --> 00:54:49,937
Me and my mom.

678
00:54:50,857 --> 00:54:53,137
But I didn't see your mom.

679
00:54:53,177 --> 00:54:56,697
I don't have a mom.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

680
00:54:59,177 --> 00:55:01,937
Where is your dad in this?
- I don't draw him.

681
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:04,777
Why?
- We don't get along much.

682
00:55:04,857 --> 00:55:06,257
He is always busy.

683
00:55:06,297 --> 00:55:08,257
Don't you have any friends
out here, Adam?

684
00:55:08,577 --> 00:55:09,577
No.

685
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:12,217
Can I be your friend?

686
00:55:13,697 --> 00:55:15,537
Will you be my friend?
- Yes!

687
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:16,537
Come.

688
00:55:19,777 --> 00:55:21,377
Your dad is out of your mind.

689
00:55:32,297 --> 00:55:33,297
Okay.

690
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:36,137
How did this happen?

691
00:55:36,177 --> 00:55:38,697
Pass it. - He doesn't make friends
that quickly.

692
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:41,537
It's good.

693
00:55:42,737 --> 00:55:44,297
That he found some company.

694
00:55:47,937 --> 00:55:50,457
It'll last only till
the red contour fades away.

695
00:55:51,777 --> 00:55:54,617
Everything will be back
to how it was once it is gone.

696
00:55:54,777 --> 00:55:55,897
Everything.

697
00:55:57,377 --> 00:55:58,497
All of it.

698
00:56:03,657 --> 00:56:04,577
Okay.

699
00:56:30,097 --> 00:56:31,977
Isn't it time for you to leave?

700
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:34,457
Your family must be waiting
for you.

701
00:56:34,897 --> 00:56:36,697
My God is my family.

702
00:56:36,937 --> 00:56:40,017
Then, you should go home
and pray to your God.

703
00:56:40,217 --> 00:56:43,257
God is always by my side,
he resides in my heart.

704
00:56:44,297 --> 00:56:47,337
I know, but please leave soon..

705
00:56:47,457 --> 00:56:50,057
You work so hard in here.
- No.

706
00:56:50,777 --> 00:56:51,817
It's okay.

707
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:55,457
See, I'm telling you,
please leave.

708
00:56:57,217 --> 00:56:58,257
Yes.

709
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:09,177
Don't you feel cold?

710
00:57:17,217 --> 00:57:19,057
Isn't your dad a scientist?

711
00:57:19,657 --> 00:57:21,377
Just imagine his workload.

712
00:57:22,497 --> 00:57:24,737
Still, he takes you along
everywhere.

713
00:57:24,857 --> 00:57:27,137
Yes, but I like my mom.

714
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,617
How can you be so sure?

715
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:30,937
You haven't seen your mom.

716
00:57:31,177 --> 00:57:32,857
You're just imagining things.

717
00:57:33,097 --> 00:57:36,497
Some people in our lives
disappoints us, at times.

718
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,217
Shut up!
My mom is perfect.

719
00:57:39,817 --> 00:57:42,377
Of course, she is.
I'm sorry.

720
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:52,657
Have you drawn other pictures
like this?

721
00:57:52,777 --> 00:57:55,657
Yes, but I don't like drawing
in a book.

722
00:57:55,737 --> 00:57:56,657
Then?

723
00:57:56,697 --> 00:57:59,417
I like to sketch on the wall.
- Really?

724
00:57:59,457 --> 00:58:02,977
Yes. But dad won't allow me.
He'll scold me, right?

725
00:58:04,257 --> 00:58:07,457
A 7 year old can do anything
that makes him happy.

726
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:11,297
Nobody should ever forbid kids
from sketching on the wall.

727
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:13,177
Go ahead and draw.
- No.

728
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:17,857
Trust me, I'm telling you.
Nobody will scold you, go.

729
00:58:18,937 --> 00:58:20,897
Don't worry.
- He won't shout at me?

730
00:58:21,057 --> 00:58:23,577
No.
- Promise me.

731
00:58:24,697 --> 00:58:25,737
I promise.

732
00:59:17,937 --> 00:59:19,217
Is this a bad time?

733
00:59:21,377 --> 00:59:23,297
Hey, come.

734
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:27,737
So, you're a scientist?

735
00:59:28,657 --> 00:59:30,537
Astrophysicist, actually.

736
00:59:35,217 --> 00:59:37,497
Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes.

737
00:59:38,777 --> 00:59:40,777
A kind of terrifying beauty.

738
00:59:41,737 --> 00:59:45,017
Like a door to another realm
altogether.

739
00:59:46,017 --> 00:59:49,017
What all secrets will be hidden
behind that red contour?

740
00:59:52,617 --> 00:59:53,817
So, where are you from?

741
00:59:54,417 --> 00:59:55,697
Your home and native..

742
00:59:57,537 --> 00:59:59,177
Far away from here.

743
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:01,937
You wouldn't happen
to know that place.

744
01:00:03,977 --> 01:00:05,537
What about your parents?

745
01:00:08,657 --> 01:00:10,137
Over there.

746
01:00:12,657 --> 01:00:13,817
Oh..

747
01:00:14,697 --> 01:00:15,737
I'm sorry.

748
01:00:17,377 --> 01:00:20,017
Your friends would still be
in the valley, right?

749
01:00:20,857 --> 01:00:23,057
I think so,
we'll find out tomorrow.

750
01:00:23,617 --> 01:00:24,737
I'll go in the morning.

751
01:00:26,137 --> 01:00:27,657
Thank you so much
for having me.

752
01:00:29,737 --> 01:00:31,097
Adam will miss you for sure.

753
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:34,937
He doesn't have
any other friends here.

754
01:00:35,577 --> 01:00:36,577
Me too.

755
01:00:44,617 --> 01:00:45,777
The gramophone won't work.

756
01:00:45,937 --> 01:00:48,737
Modern vinyl record players
work on electricity.

757
01:00:49,257 --> 01:00:50,177
But not this one.

758
01:01:59,697 --> 01:02:00,857
Adam is asleep.

759
01:02:02,017 --> 01:02:03,137
I didn't feel like
waking him up.

760
01:02:05,257 --> 01:02:06,617
Tell him that I bid goodbye
to him.

761
01:02:06,817 --> 01:02:07,737
Sure.

762
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:09,777
Ava..

763
01:02:10,817 --> 01:02:12,377
The piece of the comet..

764
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:14,337
You may keep it.

765
01:02:15,177 --> 01:02:16,537
What will I do with that?

766
01:02:17,377 --> 01:02:20,817
Scientists must have a lot
to learn from it.

767
01:02:22,297 --> 01:02:24,217
Well.. Thanks.

768
01:02:59,177 --> 01:03:00,697
Thank you so much
for everything.

769
01:03:01,057 --> 01:03:04,657
Pleasure. And who knows
whether we meet once again?

770
01:03:05,017 --> 01:03:07,137
Yes. Small world, right?

771
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:09,737
Bye, take care.
- Bye.

772
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:26,417
All of you are quite lucky

773
01:03:26,857 --> 01:03:29,137
to see this red sky
for nine days.

774
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:30,617
What do you think about it?

775
01:03:30,657 --> 01:03:33,977
We don't like it.
The red colour is inauspicious.

776
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:35,457
It's the symbol of destruction.

777
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,137
Excuse me.
Shall I ask a question?

778
01:03:38,257 --> 01:03:39,337
No..

779
01:03:44,097 --> 01:03:45,457
Do you feel bad
when you see this?

780
01:03:46,057 --> 01:03:47,937
It spells danger, no matter
when you see it.

781
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:51,217
When moon comes out,
we are afraid.

782
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:34,217
How much is it?

783
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:37,217
Why are you here?
Get lost!

784
01:04:38,097 --> 01:04:39,497
Don't ever come back.

785
01:04:45,217 --> 01:04:46,697
You do know, right?

786
01:04:47,657 --> 01:04:51,937
If I wish, then this ring
won't be able to save you.

787
01:05:05,537 --> 01:05:06,537
Hi.

788
01:05:07,417 --> 01:05:09,297
Hi, didn't you leave yet?

789
01:05:09,417 --> 01:05:10,457
Did you see your friends?

790
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:11,377
Yes, I did.

791
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:14,417
They were waiting for me.
- Where are they now?

792
01:05:14,457 --> 01:05:17,337
Well.. They left to Kaza.

793
01:05:17,657 --> 01:05:19,577
Since I don't have
any spare clothes

794
01:05:20,137 --> 01:05:21,497
I thought of shopping around.

795
01:05:22,137 --> 01:05:24,057
Everything in the bag
was burned, right?

796
01:05:24,457 --> 01:05:27,057
I came to know that there
are shops ahead. So..

797
01:05:27,577 --> 01:05:28,657
I'll be leaving soon.

798
01:05:28,737 --> 01:05:30,057
They must be waiting
for me there.

799
01:05:31,257 --> 01:05:33,057
You would've to cross the bridge
to get to the valley.

800
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:35,817
It is more than 10 kilometres
away from here.

801
01:05:36,217 --> 01:05:38,017
How will you go?
- I'll manage.

802
01:05:38,417 --> 01:05:39,497
Some horse cart will come by.

803
01:05:40,897 --> 01:05:42,497
No need of that,
I'll drop you.

804
01:05:43,017 --> 01:05:46,337
Well.. Okay, superb.
- Come.

805
01:06:03,097 --> 01:06:05,497
Sir, what happened here?

806
01:06:05,657 --> 01:06:06,977
You can't go this way.

807
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,617
The road is all ruined.

808
01:06:08,697 --> 01:06:10,937
It'll be tough to cross,
there is no other way.

809
01:06:11,297 --> 01:06:14,257
You will have to return.
- How?

810
01:06:14,897 --> 01:06:15,937
I don't know.

811
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:19,457
It'll be better for you
to return.

812
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:20,897
It's getting dark.

813
01:06:25,697 --> 01:06:26,937
This happened last night.

814
01:06:27,977 --> 01:06:29,937
There is no way to get
to the other side.

815
01:06:30,897 --> 01:06:32,057
Any boats available?

816
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:35,577
Even if you get one,
you won't reach your destination.

817
01:06:35,937 --> 01:06:37,417
The water is too turbulent.

818
01:06:38,377 --> 01:06:40,657
This is the only road that
can take you to that side.

819
01:06:40,937 --> 01:06:43,937
Until the power is restored,
the bridge can't be repaired.

820
01:06:44,177 --> 01:06:46,697
Once it is done, emergency cases
can be airlifted.

821
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,897
Now, what will you do
to get to your friends?

822
01:06:50,657 --> 01:06:51,497
It's okay.

823
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:52,857
They'll find out
about the bridge.

824
01:06:54,457 --> 01:06:56,737
Shall we go back to the cottage?

825
01:06:57,337 --> 01:06:58,537
Why don't you stay with us?

826
01:06:59,577 --> 01:07:02,017
No, drop me at the village.

827
01:07:02,817 --> 01:07:04,777
I'll stay there.

828
01:07:04,817 --> 01:07:07,577
Trust me, all the lodges
in the valley are full.

829
01:07:07,737 --> 01:07:11,777
Also, if you return,
Adam will be very happy.

830
01:08:33,617 --> 01:08:34,617
Adam!

831
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:18,017
I am so scared, Dad.

832
01:09:18,457 --> 01:09:19,657
You do know to scribble
on the walls, right?

833
01:09:19,937 --> 01:09:21,097
It's high time for you
to sleep alone now!

834
01:09:22,017 --> 01:09:23,137
He is scared, it seems!

835
01:09:23,377 --> 01:09:24,977
Zip your mouth
and go to sleep.

836
01:09:25,017 --> 01:09:27,377
I've a lot of work.
Don't disturb me for anything!

837
01:11:14,097 --> 01:11:16,377
Didn't your dad warn you
not to disturb him?

838
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:18,377
You should listen to dad.

839
01:11:19,137 --> 01:11:20,537
I-I am afraid..

840
01:11:21,337 --> 01:11:22,217
You should be!

841
01:11:22,937 --> 01:11:23,897
Who are you?

842
01:11:30,777 --> 01:11:31,897
What are you?

843
01:11:32,857 --> 01:11:35,377
Little kids should avoid
asking such questions.

844
01:11:36,537 --> 01:11:38,257
Kids should remain
what they are.

845
01:11:38,297 --> 01:11:39,377
Dad!

846
01:11:40,857 --> 01:11:42,257
No.. Leave me.

847
01:11:51,257 --> 01:11:52,217
Dad!

848
01:11:52,937 --> 01:11:55,057
Please leave me.
Let go!

849
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:56,417
Dad!

850
01:11:58,577 --> 01:12:00,017
I want to see my dad.

851
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:04,657
If you utter another word

852
01:12:07,097 --> 01:12:10,497
I'll come back again
and I'll hurt you.

853
01:12:45,937 --> 01:12:47,137
Adam..

854
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:49,057
It's me, dear.

855
01:12:49,257 --> 01:12:52,377
Dad..
- Come.

856
01:12:55,257 --> 01:12:56,257
What happened?

857
01:12:57,977 --> 01:12:58,977
It's okay.

858
01:13:01,857 --> 01:13:03,657
Good morning.
What is the matter?

859
01:13:04,017 --> 01:13:05,337
It's nothing.

860
01:13:05,657 --> 01:13:06,777
This happens, at times.

861
01:13:07,177 --> 01:13:09,217
Some bad dream while asleep
and he's wide awake.

862
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:12,737
Sir, the breakfast is ready.
- Okay.

863
01:13:14,337 --> 01:13:17,297
Come on, get ready,
we'll have breakfast downstairs.

864
01:13:17,577 --> 01:13:18,537
Okay?

865
01:13:19,137 --> 01:13:21,297
You may go.
I'll bring him.

866
01:13:38,897 --> 01:13:41,577
What you saw last night
wasn't a dream.

867
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:42,737
That was real.

868
01:13:43,137 --> 01:13:44,817
Wake up and see this world, Adam.

869
01:13:45,897 --> 01:13:48,217
You've got very little time left
in this world.

870
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:55,737
The curry is scrumptious, Hakka.

871
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,817
I don't deserve the praise
for it.

872
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:03,577
I thought I'd help Hakka.

873
01:14:04,977 --> 01:14:08,697
I made it.
- Wow.

874
01:14:09,697 --> 01:14:11,417
This is amazing, I mean..

875
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:14,257
It's salty and spicy
as per my liking.

876
01:14:14,337 --> 01:14:17,057
It's like..
Like you know me.

877
01:14:17,057 --> 01:14:19,297
Who are you?
Why did you come with my dad?

878
01:14:19,817 --> 01:14:22,577
Adam, she is our guest.
- I want to know.

879
01:14:22,697 --> 01:14:24,057
Who are you?
Why did you come here?

880
01:14:24,137 --> 01:14:25,137
Adam, quiet!

881
01:14:26,057 --> 01:14:28,377
I'm.. I'm sorry.
He is..

882
01:14:28,537 --> 01:14:31,097
You won't understand, Dad!
Never ever!

883
01:14:32,817 --> 01:14:33,737
Adam!

884
01:14:36,337 --> 01:14:37,777
At times, he is..

885
01:14:38,537 --> 01:14:41,497
Hey, it's okay.
He is a child.

886
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,297
I rebuked him a lot yesterday.

887
01:14:44,937 --> 01:14:46,217
Hence, the antics.

888
01:15:02,537 --> 01:15:05,017
I'm sorry, Dad..

889
01:15:07,617 --> 01:15:08,617
I'm sorry too.

890
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,697
Will you leave me
once again, Dad?

891
01:15:11,537 --> 01:15:12,937
When did I ever leave you, Adam?

892
01:15:16,377 --> 01:15:17,377
Listen.

893
01:15:17,537 --> 01:15:19,617
At times, I get angry.

894
01:15:19,937 --> 01:15:21,097
And I shout at you.

895
01:15:21,657 --> 01:15:23,937
But that doesn't mean
that I'll leave you.

896
01:15:24,657 --> 01:15:25,857
Promise me.

897
01:15:27,177 --> 01:15:28,337
I promise.

898
01:15:29,537 --> 01:15:31,417
We'll do one thing.

899
01:15:33,097 --> 01:15:34,937
Come with me to the base camp.

900
01:15:35,337 --> 01:15:38,057
Over there, Divya and Sandeep
are waiting to meet you.

901
01:15:38,457 --> 01:15:39,897
What say?
- Okay.

902
01:15:40,257 --> 01:15:41,337
Go and get your bag.

903
01:15:56,457 --> 01:15:57,777
Adam, good morning.

904
01:15:58,537 --> 01:15:59,857
He was too bored
of sitting there idly.

905
01:16:00,137 --> 01:16:01,257
So, I thought
of taking him along.

906
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:03,537
Hey, are you okay?
- Yes.

907
01:16:03,577 --> 01:16:05,017
He is not in a good mood.

908
01:16:05,617 --> 01:16:07,617
It will improve if he sees you.
I know that.

909
01:16:07,937 --> 01:16:08,577
You will take care of him, right?

910
01:16:08,617 --> 01:16:10,937
Absolutely.
Come, let's take a walk.

911
01:16:21,097 --> 01:16:23,097
Nobody will harm you
as long as I'm here.

912
01:16:33,377 --> 01:16:34,857
Adam, relax.

913
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:36,937
I'll tell your dad everything
that happened.

914
01:16:37,297 --> 01:16:38,257
Okay?

915
01:16:38,777 --> 01:16:39,737
No need to be scared.

916
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,937
Sir, I've some great news.

917
01:16:51,577 --> 01:16:53,017
A message from Ki Monastery.

918
01:16:53,137 --> 01:16:55,417
La Rumpa has allotted some time
to meet with you.

919
01:16:55,417 --> 01:16:57,577
Tomorrow morning.
- That's good.

920
01:16:58,097 --> 01:16:59,897
I wasn't expecting this
to happen so soon.

921
01:17:00,497 --> 01:17:01,697
They've specially mentioned

922
01:17:01,777 --> 01:17:03,257
that this meeting shouldn't
be missed by any means.

923
01:17:03,297 --> 01:17:05,257
It's a rare occasion.
- Yes, I know.

924
01:17:05,657 --> 01:17:06,697
Should I come along with you?

925
01:17:06,857 --> 01:17:07,697
It's okay.
I'll go on my own.

926
01:17:07,777 --> 01:17:08,937
Okay.
- You carry on.

927
01:17:09,177 --> 01:17:10,937
Sir, the readings.
- Yes, thanks.

928
01:17:11,617 --> 01:17:13,577
You'll drop Divya, right?
- What?

929
01:17:13,937 --> 01:17:15,697
Divya said that you'll drop her.

930
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:18,257
Oh..

931
01:17:18,777 --> 01:17:21,617
Sure, I'll drop her.
- Have a good day, sir.

932
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:22,897
Bye.
- Bye.

933
01:17:25,297 --> 01:17:27,617
Go home with Hakka now, dear.

934
01:17:27,737 --> 01:17:29,337
I'll see you soon, okay?

935
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:31,057
Dad, I'm afraid.

936
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:33,737
Since when did this start?

937
01:17:34,057 --> 01:17:35,177
Who are you afraid of?

938
01:17:37,137 --> 01:17:39,417
Stay with him
till I return, Hakka.

939
01:17:39,657 --> 01:17:40,577
Sure, sir.

940
01:17:40,617 --> 01:17:42,177
Go on.

941
01:17:49,897 --> 01:17:50,897
What happened?

942
01:17:50,937 --> 01:17:52,217
Why aren't you leaving
with the team?

943
01:17:52,377 --> 01:17:54,337
Adam told me that a visitor
is there at your house.

944
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:57,897
You didn't tell us about it,
I'm just curious.

945
01:17:59,337 --> 01:18:00,657
If you want to see her

946
01:18:00,697 --> 01:18:01,897
you're free to come by
any time.

947
01:18:02,017 --> 01:18:03,457
You know what, sir?
Sounds like a good idea.

948
01:18:03,577 --> 01:18:04,817
Why don't we just go
and meet her at once?

949
01:18:07,337 --> 01:18:08,217
What is it, Divya?

950
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:09,697
What's the problem?

951
01:18:10,017 --> 01:18:12,377
Have you ever spent
some time with Adam?

952
01:18:12,737 --> 01:18:14,497
Have you ever cared for him

953
01:18:14,937 --> 01:18:17,137
or tried to understand
his feelings?

954
01:18:17,337 --> 01:18:18,697
Behaving like an adult..
- Wait.

955
01:18:19,697 --> 01:18:20,577
Wait.

956
01:18:22,777 --> 01:18:24,937
I haven't given you the freedom

957
01:18:25,177 --> 01:18:26,457
to impart advice
on my personal life.

958
01:18:27,177 --> 01:18:29,377
You're my research assistant
and that's it.

959
01:18:31,697 --> 01:18:33,777
I know how to raise my son.

960
01:18:35,097 --> 01:18:36,657
I don't need any help
from others.

961
01:18:37,817 --> 01:18:40,217
I'm sorry, sir, I'm not prying
into your personal matters

962
01:18:40,337 --> 01:18:42,417
but there is a fact
that you should know.

963
01:18:42,657 --> 01:18:44,217
I'm trying to help you.

964
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,417
That girl..
- Divya.

965
01:18:50,177 --> 01:18:51,857
If there is anything
regarding this research

966
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:53,177
we may discuss about it.

967
01:18:53,577 --> 01:18:54,817
If not, get in the jeep.

968
01:18:54,977 --> 01:18:55,897
I'll drop you.

969
01:18:59,457 --> 01:19:02,897
Also, the log that contains
today's readings is upstairs.

970
01:19:03,017 --> 01:19:04,657
Can you please note it down?

971
01:19:24,817 --> 01:19:26,057
Hi.
- Hi.

972
01:19:26,697 --> 01:19:27,937
I walked a lot today.

973
01:19:28,337 --> 01:19:29,737
I was on the way to home.

974
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:31,817
The sight of this
helped me recall.

975
01:19:32,337 --> 01:19:34,817
We shall go together, right?
- Yes, sure.

976
01:19:35,777 --> 01:19:37,377
I'm glad that you came by.

977
01:19:37,577 --> 01:19:39,617
My assistant was eager
to meet you.

978
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:40,977
Is that Divya?

979
01:19:41,897 --> 01:19:43,017
How do you know her?

980
01:19:45,737 --> 01:19:47,257
Adam must've told you, right?

981
01:19:47,497 --> 01:19:49,777
I know her
and that too, very well.

982
01:19:55,377 --> 01:19:57,137
Hey, you okay?

983
01:19:59,057 --> 01:20:00,297
You look too disturbed.

984
01:20:01,017 --> 01:20:02,097
It has been a tiring day.

985
01:20:02,657 --> 01:20:04,257
There is a remedy
to cure stress.

986
01:20:05,257 --> 01:20:07,097
Close your eyes.
- What?

987
01:20:07,777 --> 01:20:08,937
Close your eyes.

988
01:20:10,937 --> 01:20:12,377
Whenever I was tensed,
my father used to sing

989
01:20:12,617 --> 01:20:15,737
this song for me.

990
01:20:16,777 --> 01:20:18,017
It's magic.

991
01:20:18,497 --> 01:20:19,577
Trust me.

992
01:20:20,537 --> 01:20:21,817
Okay.

993
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:17,337
She is alive,
breathing normally.

994
01:22:17,697 --> 01:22:19,817
But critical.
- Doctor..

995
01:22:20,897 --> 01:22:22,777
Taking her to another hospital,
is it going to be helpful?

996
01:22:23,057 --> 01:22:24,417
This is a small clinic.

997
01:22:24,777 --> 01:22:26,817
The town is too far
and the bridge is gone.

998
01:22:27,177 --> 01:22:29,337
No other means of transportation
as well.

999
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:31,777
So, you understand, right?

1000
01:22:31,897 --> 01:22:32,737
Okay, Doctor.

1001
01:22:33,017 --> 01:22:34,937
Thank you.
- Okay.

1002
01:22:51,777 --> 01:22:52,937
Is Adam asleep?

1003
01:22:56,097 --> 01:22:59,177
Does he know?
- Yes, sir.

1004
01:23:00,937 --> 01:23:03,897
Hakka, go to the lodge
and ask Sandeep and team

1005
01:23:04,217 --> 01:23:06,497
to stay back here for the night.
Okay?

1006
01:23:27,977 --> 01:23:29,017
Adam.

1007
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:33,697
Why are you standing here
all alone?

1008
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:36,137
Go to your bed now.

1009
01:23:36,937 --> 01:23:39,297
Dad, I want
to tell you something.

1010
01:23:40,737 --> 01:23:42,257
What is it? Tell me.

1011
01:23:42,657 --> 01:23:45,337
In private,
just you and me.

1012
01:23:58,097 --> 01:23:59,057
Tell me, Adam.

1013
01:24:01,457 --> 01:24:04,217
Dad, no one else but us
should be here.

1014
01:24:04,577 --> 01:24:05,577
What!

1015
01:24:07,377 --> 01:24:08,577
Who else is here?

1016
01:24:09,057 --> 01:24:11,697
Ava will find out
whatever I tell you.

1017
01:24:12,017 --> 01:24:13,297
Adam, what are you blabbering?

1018
01:24:13,537 --> 01:24:15,617
Ava is not what you think
she is, Dad.

1019
01:24:16,417 --> 01:24:18,217
Why did you bring her here

1020
01:24:18,457 --> 01:24:20,017
on the night
when the comet passed?

1021
01:24:20,377 --> 01:24:23,377
Why won't she leave despite
her wanting to leave?

1022
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:25,377
No, Dad.

1023
01:24:25,937 --> 01:24:27,377
We don't need Ava between us.

1024
01:24:27,697 --> 01:24:29,057
What happened to you, dear?

1025
01:24:30,217 --> 01:24:31,297
I'm worried about you.

1026
01:24:31,657 --> 01:24:33,377
I can't sleep, Dad.

1027
01:24:34,697 --> 01:24:37,137
Ava is not what you see
on the outside!

1028
01:24:38,057 --> 01:24:39,257
And Divya..

1029
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:41,537
That was not an accident.

1030
01:24:41,897 --> 01:24:42,937
She was pushed off the tower.

1031
01:24:43,457 --> 01:24:48,137
Adam, I witnessed Divya slipping
and falling off the watch tower.

1032
01:24:48,617 --> 01:24:50,457
Ava was next to me
at that time.

1033
01:24:50,497 --> 01:24:51,537
Exactly my point.

1034
01:24:52,297 --> 01:24:54,057
What you're seeing
is not the truth.

1035
01:24:54,537 --> 01:24:56,697
Ava is not what you think she is.

1036
01:24:57,577 --> 01:24:58,857
That comet..

1037
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,577
It is Ava.

1038
01:25:15,097 --> 01:25:16,537
Ava is the comet, Dad.

1039
01:25:16,577 --> 01:25:20,297
Dear.. Who is telling you
all this?

1040
01:25:20,577 --> 01:25:23,337
Dad, please, listen to me..
- No.

1041
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:27,057
And I thought..
Ava was your friend.

1042
01:25:27,777 --> 01:25:29,177
She loves you so much.

1043
01:25:29,297 --> 01:25:31,337
Dad, let's get out of here
right away.

1044
01:25:31,337 --> 01:25:32,417
Right now, let's go.

1045
01:25:32,537 --> 01:25:35,257
I need to stay here
for another week.

1046
01:25:35,377 --> 01:25:36,457
What about me then?

1047
01:25:36,537 --> 01:25:37,857
Don't you need me?

1048
01:25:40,817 --> 01:25:42,137
You're all I have.

1049
01:25:43,657 --> 01:25:46,737
As long as I'm around,
nobody will harm you.

1050
01:25:47,137 --> 01:25:50,297
I know, I'll be safe
as long as you're there but..

1051
01:25:50,337 --> 01:25:52,097
Adam, get some sleep.

1052
01:25:53,697 --> 01:25:55,057
Everything will be all right.

1053
01:26:00,737 --> 01:26:02,337
I am afraid, Dad.

1054
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:06,617
Until recently, you were afraid
of the watchmen at our apartment.

1055
01:26:07,017 --> 01:26:09,017
You weren't afraid of him
after a few days.

1056
01:26:09,377 --> 01:26:10,497
This too is something similar.

1057
01:26:12,457 --> 01:26:15,177
Be a good boy
and go to sleep.

1058
01:26:15,857 --> 01:26:16,857
Okay.

1059
01:26:19,377 --> 01:26:20,457
Good night.

1060
01:27:46,657 --> 01:27:48,977
You clever boy!

1061
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:51,937
I came down here
to take you with me.

1062
01:27:52,457 --> 01:27:53,937
You can't do anything about it.

1063
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:58,897
If you divulge anything
to anyone, I'll kill you.

1064
01:27:59,777 --> 01:28:02,297
Not just you, even your dad!

1065
01:28:03,697 --> 01:28:07,457
I'll leave on the ninth night,
taking you along.

1066
01:28:09,577 --> 01:28:12,097
Breathe, little boy..

1067
01:28:50,697 --> 01:28:52,697
What happened?
Aren't you coming?

1068
01:28:53,617 --> 01:28:54,697
Don't you want to see
the monastery?

1069
01:28:55,057 --> 01:28:55,937
Yes.

1070
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:59,097
But I'll have a good look
at it from here.

1071
01:28:59,337 --> 01:29:01,137
I like admiring things
from a distance.

1072
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:05,137
Besides, they don't have
a view like this where I'm from.

1073
01:29:07,697 --> 01:29:10,297
Okay. See you then.
- Okay.

1074
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:34,377
Are you afraid of this comet?

1075
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:35,697
Not at all.

1076
01:29:35,857 --> 01:29:38,737
It's just a glimmer
of that great power.

1077
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:40,817
Tell me something, dear.

1078
01:29:41,097 --> 01:29:43,057
Do you believe in that force?

1079
01:29:45,937 --> 01:29:46,897
You mean God?

1080
01:29:47,857 --> 01:29:48,817
I..

1081
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:50,177
I am a man of science.

1082
01:29:50,737 --> 01:29:52,657
And still, you're standing here.

1083
01:29:53,697 --> 01:29:57,457
Seeking answers to the questions
that you don't understand.

1084
01:30:00,177 --> 01:30:02,017
The things that are beyond
our understanding..

1085
01:30:02,817 --> 01:30:05,577
The attempt to understand them
is called science, right, sir?

1086
01:30:08,977 --> 01:30:11,217
I can see fear in your eyes.

1087
01:30:12,617 --> 01:30:16,377
What would someone who believes
in science be afraid of?

1088
01:30:19,297 --> 01:30:23,017
I'm afraid of both
those possibilities.

1089
01:30:24,257 --> 01:30:26,217
That's the question
that scares me.

1090
01:30:27,137 --> 01:30:28,777
You're engulfed in darkness.

1091
01:30:29,177 --> 01:30:33,137
The kind of darkness
that can destroy you.

1092
01:30:33,377 --> 01:30:34,297
What do you mean?

1093
01:30:35,137 --> 01:30:36,937
He is your son

1094
01:30:37,217 --> 01:30:40,177
and it's your duty
to protect him.

1095
01:30:40,537 --> 01:30:42,417
This is your destiny.

1096
01:30:43,817 --> 01:30:46,457
You have to face the darkness

1097
01:30:46,777 --> 01:30:48,817
and defeat it.

1098
01:30:49,337 --> 01:30:51,657
Only you can do it.

1099
01:30:53,177 --> 01:30:54,857
Protect your son

1100
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:58,697
or the darkness will destroy
both of you.

1101
01:31:00,257 --> 01:31:03,177
I shall pray for you to see
the light, my son.

1102
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:24,417
It can't enter here, Dad.

1103
01:31:26,897 --> 01:31:27,817
What?

1104
01:31:28,257 --> 01:31:30,857
Prayers. As everyone
is praying here

1105
01:31:30,937 --> 01:31:32,377
it can't enter here.

1106
01:31:56,617 --> 01:31:59,137
The doctor said her condition
is still critical.

1107
01:31:59,297 --> 01:32:00,937
The condition has improved
a bit.

1108
01:32:01,617 --> 01:32:05,617
She has broken her bones,
her ribs.. But there is still hope.

1109
01:32:05,817 --> 01:32:08,217
But how will
she come out of the coma..

1110
01:32:09,057 --> 01:32:11,657
Yes, l-let's hope for the best.

1111
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:13,417
What exactly happened?

1112
01:32:14,017 --> 01:32:16,417
I don't know. I was right there.

1113
01:32:16,817 --> 01:32:19,297
She might have slipped.

1114
01:32:19,537 --> 01:32:21,577
No way.
The railing is tall enough.

1115
01:32:21,697 --> 01:32:23,337
It's highly unlikely
for her to trip and fall.

1116
01:32:23,417 --> 01:32:25,777
Sir, she was very upset
yesterday evening.

1117
01:32:25,857 --> 01:32:27,217
Who told you so, Sandeep?

1118
01:32:27,937 --> 01:32:29,777
Don't assume things
that we don't know.

1119
01:32:31,097 --> 01:32:33,017
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm just tired.

1120
01:32:34,337 --> 01:32:36,457
You may go home if you want.
I will be here.

1121
01:32:38,337 --> 01:32:39,497
I will see you.
- Yes.

1122
01:32:56,057 --> 01:32:57,457
Are you leaving tonight, Hakka?

1123
01:33:00,297 --> 01:33:02,817
Please don't go.
I will be left alone.

1124
01:33:05,937 --> 01:33:06,817
Keep this with you.

1125
01:33:07,137 --> 01:33:08,737
You won't have
to fear anything now.

1126
01:33:31,657 --> 01:33:32,697
Thank you, Hakka.

1127
01:33:32,897 --> 01:33:36,137
You may go home now.
It is too late into the night.

1128
01:33:36,537 --> 01:33:39,617
You might lose your way
in this darkness.

1129
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:41,537
The Lord will show me the way.

1130
01:33:41,617 --> 01:33:43,057
Let's see.

1131
01:34:12,417 --> 01:34:13,537
Adam.

1132
01:34:15,697 --> 01:34:16,777
Adam.

1133
01:34:24,897 --> 01:34:28,937
Adam..

1134
01:36:43,897 --> 01:36:47,817
How many times had I warned you
not to tell anyone?

1135
01:36:50,697 --> 01:36:52,777
But you divulged everything
to your dad.

1136
01:36:52,897 --> 01:36:55,497
You told him that I can't enter
the monastery, right?

1137
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:58,177
I know everything.

1138
01:36:58,417 --> 01:36:59,377
Everything.

1139
01:39:08,937 --> 01:39:10,017
Why are you looking at me

1140
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:12,017
like you are seeing me
for the first time, sir?

1141
01:39:18,617 --> 01:39:21,577
Don't believe everything
that you see, Albert.

1142
01:39:22,857 --> 01:39:24,137
Your eyes can lie.

1143
01:39:49,217 --> 01:39:51,017
You are left alone, right, Albert?

1144
01:39:52,337 --> 01:39:56,377
I miss you, Annie, all the time.

1145
01:40:00,097 --> 01:40:01,057
Me too.

1146
01:40:09,537 --> 01:40:10,497
I know.

1147
01:40:11,217 --> 01:40:14,817
Ever since I left,
you've never been happy.

1148
01:40:15,897 --> 01:40:18,377
Your anger, agony

1149
01:40:18,697 --> 01:40:21,457
frustration, hate..

1150
01:40:22,297 --> 01:40:23,777
I can see all of it.

1151
01:40:24,537 --> 01:40:26,217
I feel every moment of it.

1152
01:40:27,937 --> 01:40:29,257
This is a dream.

1153
01:40:31,497 --> 01:40:32,857
You are not real.

1154
01:40:34,057 --> 01:40:35,737
Have you ever thought

1155
01:40:36,897 --> 01:40:39,617
how our lives would've been
had it changed a bit..

1156
01:40:40,617 --> 01:40:44,497
If the decisions we had made
were a bit different..

1157
01:40:45,017 --> 01:40:46,897
How different things
would have been?

1158
01:40:47,457 --> 01:40:50,617
I would still have been
with you.

1159
01:40:51,897 --> 01:40:53,697
He ruined everything, didn't he?

1160
01:40:54,657 --> 01:40:56,017
He took it all away.

1161
01:40:58,737 --> 01:41:02,617
Annie, what are you saying?

1162
01:41:03,777 --> 01:41:05,017
Isn't it true, Albert?

1163
01:41:06,177 --> 01:41:09,257
He first separated me from you.

1164
01:41:10,217 --> 01:41:13,257
He then shattered your happiness
and peace of mind.

1165
01:41:14,257 --> 01:41:16,417
Every time you saw him

1166
01:41:17,017 --> 01:41:19,417
you were full of grief,
thinking about me, right?

1167
01:41:26,337 --> 01:41:27,497
Should I believe the lie

1168
01:41:27,617 --> 01:41:32,017
that you've been telling yourself
all these years, Albert?

1169
01:41:33,297 --> 01:41:34,577
Do you really love him?

1170
01:41:36,137 --> 01:41:39,937
How many times have you thought
if he hadn't been with you?

1171
01:41:47,017 --> 01:41:49,177
He was a mistake, Albert.

1172
01:41:50,457 --> 01:41:52,377
He was a mistake we made.

1173
01:41:53,937 --> 01:41:56,377
We need to correct that mistake.

1174
01:41:58,017 --> 01:41:59,537
Give him to me.

1175
01:42:01,057 --> 01:42:02,657
You don't need him anymore.

1176
01:42:03,057 --> 01:42:04,457
I am his mother

1177
01:42:04,977 --> 01:42:07,577
and I will take him far away.

1178
01:42:08,777 --> 01:42:11,897
He will never ever bother you.

1179
01:42:29,337 --> 01:42:30,217
Adam!

1180
01:42:31,817 --> 01:42:33,857
Come on.
Let's go, Dad.

1181
01:42:59,897 --> 01:43:02,937
Dad.. Let's go.. Come on.

1182
01:43:37,137 --> 01:43:39,857
You may sleep.
I am with you.

1183
01:43:40,537 --> 01:43:42,137
No one will hurt you anymore.

1184
01:43:42,777 --> 01:43:43,817
Is that a promise?

1185
01:43:44,337 --> 01:43:45,457
I promise.

1186
01:43:46,857 --> 01:43:49,297
Don't leave me alone, Dad.

1187
01:43:49,377 --> 01:43:51,337
You are all I've got.

1188
01:43:51,697 --> 01:43:54,137
I will be a good child from now.

1189
01:43:54,217 --> 01:43:56,177
How can I leave you, dear?

1190
01:43:57,057 --> 01:43:58,777
You are all I have got, right?

1191
01:44:20,937 --> 01:44:23,697
Sandeep, who is at the hospital?
- Ibrahim.

1192
01:44:23,777 --> 01:44:27,097
Okay. Stay here with Adam until
I come back.

1193
01:44:28,457 --> 01:44:29,537
Dad, where are you going?

1194
01:44:29,657 --> 01:44:32,217
I have some things to do.

1195
01:44:32,297 --> 01:44:34,017
Mr. Sandeep will be with you.
I will be back soon.

1196
01:44:34,097 --> 01:44:35,737
Will you?
- I will.

1197
01:44:36,977 --> 01:44:38,417
Hey. Be with him.
- Yes, sir.

1198
01:44:38,577 --> 01:44:40,217
Sir, is everything okay?

1199
01:45:02,057 --> 01:45:03,017
Hakka!

1200
01:45:42,857 --> 01:45:47,097
This comet is toying
with people's brains.

1201
01:45:47,777 --> 01:45:50,337
What you just said
can never happen.

1202
01:45:50,817 --> 01:45:53,937
Listen. The whole world
is after it.

1203
01:45:54,177 --> 01:45:56,937
Sir, my assistant is fighting
against death at the hospital.

1204
01:45:57,217 --> 01:46:00,057
My caretaker is missing. I feel,
something has happened to him.

1205
01:46:00,137 --> 01:46:02,537
We have the report
from the hospital, sir.

1206
01:46:02,737 --> 01:46:05,737
She slipped and fell
as per your report.

1207
01:46:05,937 --> 01:46:07,737
And your caretaker
is a tribal man.

1208
01:46:07,857 --> 01:46:10,137
He might have gone
in to the forest to his people.

1209
01:46:10,737 --> 01:46:12,897
So, there isn't anything you can
do for me now, right?

1210
01:46:13,057 --> 01:46:16,017
No. Not for the next four days.

1211
01:46:16,417 --> 01:46:18,497
You are young and healthy.

1212
01:46:19,137 --> 01:46:21,137
Protect yourself and listen..

1213
01:46:22,297 --> 01:46:24,537
Try everything you can
to stay alive.

1214
01:46:26,777 --> 01:46:29,497
What if she tries to kill you?

1215
01:46:43,297 --> 01:46:44,137
Hey..

1216
01:46:54,297 --> 01:46:55,777
Your dad hasn't come yet, Adam.

1217
01:46:55,937 --> 01:46:57,177
Shall we go to the lodge?

1218
01:46:57,337 --> 01:47:00,337
No, he said that he'd
take me to a place.

1219
01:47:00,457 --> 01:47:04,057
He wanted you to take me there
if he is late.

1220
01:47:04,297 --> 01:47:08,617
Shall we write a note to let him
know we've gone to the lodge?

1221
01:47:08,737 --> 01:47:12,377
No! He asked me to go there
in case he is late.

1222
01:47:13,217 --> 01:47:15,937
Dad will not come here and so,
he won't find the note.

1223
01:47:16,017 --> 01:47:17,737
All right..

1224
01:47:19,137 --> 01:47:21,817
Neerav, won't you walk
to the lodge? - Yes.

1225
01:47:21,937 --> 01:47:24,177
I have to take him somewhere.
- Okay. - Okay.

1226
01:47:27,057 --> 01:47:30,017
Adam, where did he want me
to take you? - Ki Monastery.

1227
01:48:10,897 --> 01:48:13,137
Neerav, where is Adam?
He isn't at the base camp.

1228
01:48:13,217 --> 01:48:15,137
Sir, he went with Sandeep.
- Where?

1229
01:48:15,257 --> 01:48:16,137
Ki Monastery.

1230
01:48:16,417 --> 01:48:18,097
Adam asked Sandeep
to take him there.

1231
01:48:18,217 --> 01:48:20,177
Adam said you'd come there.

1232
01:48:20,937 --> 01:48:22,337
Didn't you say that?

1233
01:48:22,577 --> 01:48:26,137
The monastery..
Well done, Adam.

1234
01:48:28,777 --> 01:48:30,057
Can't you drive faster?

1235
01:48:30,257 --> 01:48:33,497
No.. The road is narrow.
It's very dangerous.

1236
01:48:33,897 --> 01:48:36,857
It will be even more dangerous
if we don't go faster. - What?

1237
01:48:37,217 --> 01:48:38,297
What are you talking about?

1238
01:48:42,497 --> 01:48:43,537
Jeez.

1239
01:48:44,777 --> 01:48:45,737
We can't pass through.

1240
01:48:45,857 --> 01:48:48,417
Let me move it.
- No. Let's go.

1241
01:48:48,777 --> 01:48:51,497
W-What if it's alive, Adam?

1242
01:48:51,617 --> 01:48:53,817
Please, sir. Let's go.
- Adam. - I beg you.

1243
01:48:53,937 --> 01:48:54,977
Why are you acting this way?

1244
01:48:55,217 --> 01:48:56,297
The monastery is near, isn't it?

1245
01:48:56,457 --> 01:48:58,537
We will be there soon.
Please don't worry.

1246
01:51:42,297 --> 01:51:43,377
Hakka.

1247
01:53:24,817 --> 01:53:25,777
Adam.

1248
01:54:15,297 --> 01:54:16,617
Dear.. Adam..

1249
01:54:19,457 --> 01:54:20,417
Hakka.

1250
01:54:22,137 --> 01:54:23,097
Hakka.

1251
01:54:24,417 --> 01:54:26,977
Hakka..
What happened to you?

1252
01:54:27,297 --> 01:54:28,217
Hakka.

1253
01:54:53,857 --> 01:54:56,897
Adam.. It's me, your dad.
- No..

1254
01:54:58,097 --> 01:55:00,057
Hey! Adam..

1255
01:55:03,777 --> 01:55:04,697
Adam..

1256
01:55:06,777 --> 01:55:07,737
Adam..

1257
01:55:29,297 --> 01:55:30,297
Albert.

1258
01:55:49,777 --> 01:55:50,857
Dr. Khan.

1259
01:55:51,457 --> 01:55:53,617
W-When did you..

1260
01:55:55,697 --> 01:55:59,057
Adam.. Where is he?

1261
01:55:59,857 --> 01:56:02,497
Some villagers brought you here

1262
01:56:02,617 --> 01:56:04,617
last night and you were
almost unconscious.

1263
01:56:05,977 --> 01:56:08,537
I met with Divya, Sandeep
and Hakka.

1264
01:56:09,297 --> 01:56:11,257
The only information

1265
01:56:11,657 --> 01:56:15,097
I have is what you'd
told me in the last 10 hours.

1266
01:56:17,537 --> 01:56:22,297
Albert, listen carefully
to what I'm going to tell you.

1267
01:56:23,097 --> 01:56:24,017
Sir..

1268
01:56:24,857 --> 01:56:26,217
Sir, what are you..

1269
01:56:29,057 --> 01:56:30,217
Ava..

1270
01:56:31,857 --> 01:56:32,897
Where is she?

1271
01:56:33,817 --> 01:56:34,937
Ava..

1272
01:56:36,937 --> 01:56:38,177
She doesn't exist, Albert.

1273
01:56:39,537 --> 01:56:41,057
There was never an Ava.

1274
01:56:42,817 --> 01:56:43,777
What?

1275
01:56:44,937 --> 01:56:47,017
Albert, the greatest darkness
in the universe

1276
01:56:47,097 --> 01:56:48,497
is not within a black hole, Albert.

1277
01:56:50,097 --> 01:56:51,657
It's inside the human mind.

1278
01:56:52,257 --> 01:56:55,097
Every human
has that dark side in him.

1279
01:56:55,857 --> 01:56:56,937
That darkness

1280
01:56:57,537 --> 01:56:59,937
is the hatred you harboured
against your son

1281
01:57:00,057 --> 01:57:03,097
which grew inside you
without your knowledge.

1282
01:57:03,577 --> 01:57:05,737
In all his acts of mischief..

1283
01:57:06,337 --> 01:57:08,937
Every rebuke that James
aimed at him..

1284
01:57:09,337 --> 01:57:11,897
Every moment
in which you missed Annie..

1285
01:57:12,137 --> 01:57:14,137
The darkness grew.

1286
01:57:14,497 --> 01:57:16,697
When it reached a tipping point

1287
01:57:17,057 --> 01:57:21,257
you needed a form for the hatred
that you harboured against him

1288
01:57:21,777 --> 01:57:24,457
and a reason to justify it.

1289
01:57:24,537 --> 01:57:27,217
Ava is that reason, Albert.

1290
01:57:28,537 --> 01:57:30,257
She was the darker side of you.

1291
01:57:32,337 --> 01:57:33,337
She was you.

1292
01:57:40,897 --> 01:57:43,257
You are suffering
from bipolar schizophrenia.

1293
01:57:45,377 --> 01:57:47,817
You are the only one
who has seen Ava.

1294
01:57:49,337 --> 01:57:50,417
I..

1295
01:57:51,777 --> 01:57:53,577
I don't understand.

1296
01:57:53,737 --> 01:57:55,497
Just retrace your memory.

1297
01:57:55,937 --> 01:57:56,857
Day one.

1298
01:58:00,257 --> 01:58:02,137
The day that comet passed..

1299
01:58:03,217 --> 01:58:06,177
Witnessing a spectacle
like that all alone..

1300
01:58:06,417 --> 01:58:09,297
That tipping point
which unbalanced you..

1301
01:58:09,617 --> 01:58:11,737
That could have been it.

1302
01:58:12,177 --> 01:58:14,577
You didn't realise
that you are the only one

1303
01:58:15,057 --> 01:58:16,337
who came back that night.

1304
01:58:29,777 --> 01:58:30,737
Day two.

1305
01:58:32,057 --> 01:58:34,257
You didn't go to the base camp.
- No.

1306
01:58:34,857 --> 01:58:37,937
I went back into the woods
that day.

1307
01:58:38,217 --> 01:58:40,057
Then, I..
- Correct.

1308
01:58:40,657 --> 01:58:43,297
You were really worried
when you got back.

1309
01:58:44,377 --> 01:58:45,337
That day

1310
01:58:46,177 --> 01:58:49,577
unlike all days, you were asleep
in the poolside cottage

1311
01:58:49,937 --> 01:58:50,977
and Adam came to see you there.

1312
01:58:51,097 --> 01:58:53,337
He was happy when you showed him

1313
01:58:54,377 --> 01:58:57,537
the affection that you had
never shown him before.

1314
01:58:57,617 --> 01:59:01,737
The joy of his dad being his friend
for the first time.

1315
01:59:04,577 --> 01:59:06,217
'Can I be your friend?'

1316
01:59:07,377 --> 01:59:09,377
'Will you be my friend?
- Yes.'

1317
01:59:10,177 --> 01:59:11,097
'Come.'

1318
01:59:12,897 --> 01:59:14,897
'Your dad is out of his mind!'

1319
01:59:15,097 --> 01:59:17,737
'But dad won't agree to it.
Won't he rebuke me?'

1320
01:59:18,297 --> 01:59:20,937
'Trust me. I am telling you.'

1321
01:59:22,857 --> 01:59:24,537
That day, he realised

1322
01:59:25,217 --> 01:59:28,137
that something
is wrong with his dad.

1323
01:59:29,497 --> 01:59:32,697
'Didn't your dad warn you
not to disturb him?'

1324
01:59:32,857 --> 01:59:35,617
'You should really listen to him.
- I am scared.'

1325
01:59:35,817 --> 01:59:38,617
'You should be.
- Who are you?'

1326
01:59:38,897 --> 01:59:41,257
'Kids shouldn't ask
too many questions.'

1327
01:59:43,737 --> 01:59:47,497
'D-Dad, please leave me..'

1328
01:59:48,697 --> 01:59:52,697
When he got scared after seeing
you next morning

1329
01:59:53,697 --> 01:59:55,377
you thought he had a nightmare.

1330
01:59:56,257 --> 01:59:58,177
'Adam.
- Dad.'

1331
02:00:00,017 --> 02:00:02,257
'What you saw last night
wasn't a dream.'

1332
02:00:02,737 --> 02:00:03,937
'That was real.'

1333
02:00:04,617 --> 02:00:07,657
He tried talking
to Ava after that

1334
02:00:08,417 --> 02:00:11,577
hoping that you'd understand
the reality.

1335
02:00:11,857 --> 02:00:14,897
'I mean, it's salty and spicy
as per my liking.'

1336
02:00:15,017 --> 02:00:17,337
'It's like..
Like you know me.'

1337
02:00:19,057 --> 02:00:21,457
'Who are you? Why did
you come here with my dad?'

1338
02:00:21,897 --> 02:00:23,817
'Adam, she is a guest.'

1339
02:00:23,937 --> 02:00:26,737
'Dad, you won't understand.
Never ever. - Hey!'

1340
02:00:26,857 --> 02:00:29,177
Amongst your team members,
he was close to Divya.

1341
02:00:29,257 --> 02:00:30,617
And he told her everything.

1342
02:00:30,697 --> 02:00:32,257
'Sir, I am trying to help you.'

1343
02:00:33,177 --> 02:00:34,577
'That girl..
- Divya.'

1344
02:00:35,577 --> 02:00:37,377
When Ava realised that Divya
would be a threat

1345
02:00:37,937 --> 02:00:41,337
to her very existence
as she'd realised the truth..

1346
02:00:41,697 --> 02:00:42,697
That is, you..

1347
02:00:43,137 --> 02:00:44,177
Got rid of her.

1348
02:00:51,217 --> 02:00:52,297
'Divya!'

1349
02:00:54,297 --> 02:00:58,017
Your son is way too brilliant
for a seven-year-old.

1350
02:00:58,817 --> 02:01:02,777
In one of those moments,
he realised that you were Albert

1351
02:01:04,057 --> 02:01:07,057
and told you everything
that he knew about Ava.

1352
02:01:07,137 --> 02:01:09,937
'Ava will know everything
that I tell you, Dad.'

1353
02:01:10,057 --> 02:01:11,177
'Ava..'

1354
02:01:11,697 --> 02:01:14,697
'No, Dad. We don't need Ava
between us.'

1355
02:01:14,897 --> 02:01:16,457
But unfortunately

1356
02:01:17,377 --> 02:01:20,217
Ava processed everything
that Albert had heard

1357
02:01:21,897 --> 02:01:23,217
and you hurt him again.

1358
02:01:25,657 --> 02:01:27,617
'How many times
had I warned you..'

1359
02:01:27,737 --> 02:01:29,697
'Not to tell anyone..'

1360
02:01:31,017 --> 02:01:32,537
'I know everything.'

1361
02:01:33,137 --> 02:01:35,937
The moment La Rumpa saw you
at the monastery

1362
02:01:36,337 --> 02:01:37,257
he realised the darkness
within you.

1363
02:01:37,337 --> 02:01:41,937
'Protect your son or this darkness
will consume both of you.'

1364
02:01:42,057 --> 02:01:44,937
Every moment that Adam spent
with you in fear

1365
02:01:45,457 --> 02:01:48,417
wondering whether you
were Albert or Ava

1366
02:01:49,097 --> 02:01:50,377
he tried to help you realise

1367
02:01:50,697 --> 02:01:53,137
the changes
that were happening inside you.

1368
02:01:53,897 --> 02:01:57,337
'Dad, I want
to speak with you alone.'

1369
02:01:58,057 --> 02:01:59,297
'Just the two of us, Dad.'

1370
02:01:59,417 --> 02:02:03,697
He kept on giving you clues
but you couldn't realise it.

1371
02:02:05,617 --> 02:02:07,137
Everything that happened later..

1372
02:02:07,257 --> 02:02:08,937
Hakka, Sandeep..

1373
02:02:09,417 --> 02:02:11,017
It was you, Albert.

1374
02:02:21,497 --> 02:02:25,777
Sandeep is all right.
He sustained a minor head injury.

1375
02:02:26,897 --> 02:02:31,657
Hakka will be bedridden
for another two months.

1376
02:02:33,377 --> 02:02:36,697
Divya is still in a coma.

1377
02:02:37,217 --> 02:02:40,297
Adam.. My son..

1378
02:02:41,417 --> 02:02:43,937
He..
- What did he do to him, Albert?

1379
02:02:45,377 --> 02:02:47,657
Only Ava knows the answer.

1380
02:02:49,017 --> 02:02:50,297
But as I said

1381
02:02:51,657 --> 02:02:53,017
Ava is inside you.

1382
02:02:53,937 --> 02:02:55,057
So, ask yourself.

1383
02:02:55,937 --> 02:02:57,777
What did you do to your son?

1384
02:02:59,617 --> 02:03:01,057
You are wrong, Dr. Khan.

1385
02:03:01,937 --> 02:03:04,737
I could never hurt my son.

1386
02:03:05,777 --> 02:03:07,057
I love my son.

1387
02:03:08,337 --> 02:03:09,297
And Ava..

1388
02:03:10,457 --> 02:03:13,417
She.. The things
that she said to me..

1389
02:03:13,977 --> 02:03:15,297
All of it is real.

1390
02:03:15,897 --> 02:03:16,897
I know.

1391
02:03:17,417 --> 02:03:18,457
I saw her.

1392
02:03:19,217 --> 02:03:20,137
I heard her.

1393
02:03:20,257 --> 02:03:24,937
One person can prove
that what I said is true.

1394
02:03:25,977 --> 02:03:27,577
Only that person can do it.

1395
02:03:28,417 --> 02:03:30,657
Adam, your son.

1396
02:03:32,017 --> 02:03:34,057
It's the eighth night today.

1397
02:03:34,177 --> 02:03:36,537
You have one more day left.

1398
02:03:37,737 --> 02:03:39,097
On the tenth morning

1399
02:03:39,377 --> 02:03:40,577
I will call the police.

1400
02:03:42,377 --> 02:03:43,897
I will give you the ninth day.

1401
02:03:44,937 --> 02:03:48,097
To find out your son
if he is alive.

1402
02:03:49,137 --> 02:03:52,937
Go, Albert.
Find him before it's too late.

1403
02:04:09,417 --> 02:04:10,817
I know she is real.

1404
02:04:12,337 --> 02:04:13,937
Can you give me an answer?

1405
02:04:14,737 --> 02:04:17,497
I can't answer your question.

1406
02:04:18,457 --> 02:04:20,657
You are writing
your own story.

1407
02:04:21,377 --> 02:04:23,617
It is up to you to decide
how it ends.

1408
02:04:24,217 --> 02:04:28,977
If you feel she is real,
find her.

1409
02:04:29,537 --> 02:04:32,857
If she is inside you,
identify the darkness.

1410
02:04:33,537 --> 02:04:38,217
Go to her world and she will
show you your biggest fear.

1411
02:04:39,017 --> 02:04:41,017
You just have a few hours left.

1412
02:04:41,177 --> 02:04:43,377
Find her. Find Adam.

1413
02:05:06,737 --> 02:05:07,857
Where is the child?

1414
02:05:09,297 --> 02:05:12,897
He is my son
and even I am looking for him.

1415
02:05:13,417 --> 02:05:14,897
Please move out of my way.

1416
02:05:15,097 --> 02:05:17,977
We know that it's you
who took him.

1417
02:05:18,097 --> 02:05:21,257
And we also know
about what you did to Hakka.

1418
02:05:21,497 --> 02:05:23,017
Tell us. Where is the child?

1419
02:05:24,217 --> 02:05:26,057
Listen. I don't have much time

1420
02:05:26,257 --> 02:05:28,457
and I have to find my son.

1421
02:05:29,417 --> 02:05:30,337
Please.

1422
02:05:31,497 --> 02:05:32,417
Wait.

1423
02:05:33,297 --> 02:05:34,617
Hey! Don't you touch me!

1424
02:05:35,097 --> 02:05:36,297
Don't you lay your hands on me!

1425
02:06:28,617 --> 02:06:29,857
Stop.

1426
02:06:40,737 --> 02:06:43,377
Only I can find my son.

1427
02:06:46,537 --> 02:06:50,657
If I lose him, I will
definitely come back

1428
02:06:52,937 --> 02:06:53,977
for you.

1429
02:06:55,097 --> 02:06:56,937
Go and find your son.

1430
02:06:57,017 --> 02:07:01,697
If you don't find him or if
something happens to Hakka

1431
02:07:01,857 --> 02:07:05,217
don't you dare come
to this forest again.

1432
02:07:22,177 --> 02:07:23,257
Ava!

1433
02:08:43,177 --> 02:08:44,257
Ava!

1434
02:08:46,617 --> 02:08:47,577
Ava!

1435
02:09:09,937 --> 02:09:13,097
Where is Adam? Tell me.

1436
02:09:13,897 --> 02:09:15,697
You know where he is.

1437
02:09:16,097 --> 02:09:18,377
Ava.
- Ava..

1438
02:09:19,137 --> 02:09:22,257
Did you forget me so soon, Albert?

1439
02:09:26,377 --> 02:09:27,497
Ms. Mercy.

1440
02:09:27,857 --> 02:09:32,617
I needed a face that
you'd forgotten.

1441
02:09:32,697 --> 02:09:36,017
I found it in Ms. Mercy,
your favourite teacher.

1442
02:09:47,897 --> 02:09:49,577
He was a mistake you made.

1443
02:09:51,217 --> 02:09:54,937
There are a lot of things
you can accomplish in your life.

1444
02:09:57,177 --> 02:09:58,977
You are meant for greater things.

1445
02:10:01,897 --> 02:10:05,497
Why have a son
who hinders your progress?

1446
02:10:06,457 --> 02:10:08,017
Just forget him.

1447
02:10:09,177 --> 02:10:10,577
I will take him.

1448
02:10:11,777 --> 02:10:13,697
You will be free then, Albert.

1449
02:10:15,217 --> 02:10:16,497
Do you think

1450
02:10:17,257 --> 02:10:21,257
I can live after handing him
over to you?

1451
02:10:23,737 --> 02:10:26,297
Irrespective of who
and what you are

1452
02:10:27,057 --> 02:10:28,377
I promise you

1453
02:10:29,697 --> 02:10:31,817
if I don't get my son back

1454
02:10:33,217 --> 02:10:35,377
I will kill myself.

1455
02:10:40,217 --> 02:10:41,337
Why, Albert?

1456
02:10:42,657 --> 02:10:45,857
Why should you die
for your son?

1457
02:10:47,257 --> 02:10:48,737
Because I love him.

1458
02:10:51,697 --> 02:10:53,417
Because I am his father.

1459
02:11:03,697 --> 02:11:06,897
Ancient humans were like us.

1460
02:11:07,737 --> 02:11:09,737
And gradually, they changed.

1461
02:11:10,817 --> 02:11:12,377
The world changed them

1462
02:11:13,257 --> 02:11:16,737
protected them
and handed them weapons.

1463
02:11:18,057 --> 02:11:22,857
A weapon that was strong
and beyond our understanding.

1464
02:11:25,457 --> 02:11:28,137
Love, affection.

1465
02:11:29,657 --> 02:11:30,777
Humanity.

1466
02:11:31,497 --> 02:11:33,137
Earth's biggest weapon.

1467
02:11:34,057 --> 02:11:38,017
The only weapon that you have
against me.

1468
02:11:39,297 --> 02:11:40,817
And you have used that.

1469
02:11:42,017 --> 02:11:43,777
I want to know

1470
02:11:44,097 --> 02:11:47,657
whether your love is true.

1471
02:11:50,537 --> 02:11:51,897
Look to the sky.

1472
02:11:55,297 --> 02:11:58,097
When the red colour fades away,
I will go.

1473
02:11:58,937 --> 02:12:01,337
And Adam will come along
with me.

1474
02:12:02,177 --> 02:12:05,537
You just have a few minutes
to save your son.

1475
02:12:07,617 --> 02:12:08,657
How?

1476
02:12:09,617 --> 02:12:12,217
How could I.. Where?

1477
02:12:16,817 --> 02:12:18,737
I-I don't remember.

1478
02:12:20,657 --> 02:12:21,937
Just tell me.

1479
02:12:23,857 --> 02:12:24,817
No.

1480
02:12:26,817 --> 02:12:28,257
No. Don't go.

1481
02:13:01,817 --> 02:13:02,777
Annie.

1482
02:13:05,377 --> 02:13:06,457
Our son..

1483
02:13:09,737 --> 02:13:11,657
I couldn't save him.

1484
02:13:12,617 --> 02:13:14,297
I killed him.

1485
02:13:15,217 --> 02:13:16,897
I killed our son.

1486
02:13:35,817 --> 02:13:36,697
Adam..

1487
02:13:42,937 --> 02:13:43,897
Adam!

1488
02:13:56,257 --> 02:13:57,217
Adam.

1489
02:14:00,937 --> 02:14:01,937
Adam.

1490
02:14:03,457 --> 02:14:04,377
Adam.

1491
02:14:05,497 --> 02:14:06,417
Adam.

1492
02:14:37,897 --> 02:14:38,817
Adam.

1493
02:14:39,577 --> 02:14:40,457
Adam.

1494
02:14:41,497 --> 02:14:44,057
Adam..

1495
02:14:44,497 --> 02:14:45,377
Dear..

1496
02:14:52,817 --> 02:14:54,457
Adam..

1497
02:14:54,937 --> 02:14:56,617
Dear.. Adam..

1498
02:14:57,977 --> 02:14:59,257
I am so sorry.

1499
02:15:00,417 --> 02:15:01,937
I am so sorry.

1500
02:15:09,017 --> 02:15:09,937
Dad.

1501
02:15:16,097 --> 02:15:18,137
Adam.
- Dad.

1502
02:15:19,537 --> 02:15:20,617
Are you okay?

1503
02:15:23,057 --> 02:15:24,457
I love you so much.

1504
02:15:24,857 --> 02:15:26,017
I love you!

1505
02:15:27,457 --> 02:15:31,577
I love you so much.
- I love you too, Dad.

1506
02:16:16,217 --> 02:16:18,297
My dad had told me

1507
02:16:19,937 --> 02:16:24,737
that we'd get the answers to
all our questions from there.

1508
02:16:26,777 --> 02:16:28,817
But the question
that I've in my mind now..

1509
02:16:31,177 --> 02:16:32,977
Only you can answer it.

1510
02:16:35,457 --> 02:16:36,577
Ava.

1511
02:16:37,777 --> 02:16:39,337
Was she real?

1512
02:17:08,497 --> 02:17:11,337
'On the walls of their caves
are written the ancient scriptures'

1513
02:17:11,417 --> 02:17:15,057
'stating the passing
of another red comet ages ago'

1514
02:17:15,497 --> 02:17:17,217
'and its imminent return.'
