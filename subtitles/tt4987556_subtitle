1
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,376
<i>Define your enemy</i>

2
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:52,378
<i>and I will define you.</i>

3
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:57,258
Look at this weirdo
standing upside down!

4
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,635
Stop! If I catch hold of you,
I'll finish you!

5
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:02,138
Listen, Sengal!
- Why did you come here?

6
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:03,890
Your wife is going through labor pain.

7
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:06,184
We have to get her to the hospital.
Come on!

8
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:09,395
Who will tie the flag then?
- Ask your leader to tie it.

9
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,315
You are not qualified to talk
about my leader! Get lost!

10
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:15,693
Get lost! I regret getting
my daughter married to this fool.

11
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,404
Look! Our leader has arrived!
- Is it?

12
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:20,323
The interview was excellent.

13
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,658
That's not enough. - Okay, sir.
- Make sure it has my photo

14
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:23,701
standing alongside a party member.
- Okay, sir.

15
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:25,161
Seems like our leader
has arrived very early.

16
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:26,537
Who here is the most dedicated follower
of our party?

17
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:28,247
The one who is approaching,
Sengalvarayan.

18
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:30,124
Now, what kind of a name is that?

19
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:32,502
Sengalvarayan!

20
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:34,504
You called out my name!
- Come here.

21
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,547
Did you just call out my name?
- Come here.

22
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:38,966
Sir! - Come on,
stop prostrating.

23
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,593
Get up.
- He worships you, sir.

24
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:43,596
I would've considered myself lucky if I could
at least get a close-up view of you.

25
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,098
But you just called out my name!

26
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,808
That's nothing.

27
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:48,309
You aren't an ordinary follower
of the party.

28
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:51,854
Strong people like you are the basis
of this party that I've established.

29
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,064
Sengal!

30
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:55,566
What happened, Sengamalai?
- Would you ever pay heed to me?

31
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,653
Why are you putting us
through all this in the name of your party?

32
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,196
Her water broke.

33
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:04,492
Looks like she'll deliver the child on the
street even before reaching the hospital!

34
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:06,202
If we lose her, will your leader
take the responsibility?

35
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,830
Is this the plight
of my follower's pregnant wife?

36
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,331
Come here!
- Yes, sir?

37
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,041
Bring my car, turn on the siren

38
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,960
and take them to the hospital!
- Hail the chief minister!

39
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:17,255
I am more concerned about
my party men's family than the party!

40
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:18,715
Stop the car!
Stop it!

41
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:22,802
Come here.

42
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:24,303
Hurry up!

43
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:27,098
Hold on, dear.
You will be fine.

44
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:29,392
<i>We welcome the future!</i>

45
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:35,273
Sengal!
You are blessed with a baby boy.

46
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,068
Look at your boy, Sengalvarayan.

47
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:42,113
He has entered this world
in a leader's car! He is very lucky.

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,990
Thank you
for your blessings, sir!

49
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,334
Here comes the party leader.

50
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:58,296
Wait and watch what happens
if he doesn't allot me a seat!

51
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:00,298
What is he up to?
He has come with his supporters.

52
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:03,009
Dad, what is the fuss all about?

53
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,845
Our district MLA has expired
and the by-elections are approaching.

54
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:07,722
Though our party will win, it's our leader
who will decide who the next MLA will be.

55
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:08,848
Hence, all the chaos.

56
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:12,226
What do you mean? Do you think
I'll feel threatened by this chaos?

57
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,352
Are you trying
to divide the party?

58
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:17,190
You will face the consequences if you
allot the seat to someone else. - Hey!

59
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:21,194
Listen, as the party leader,
I'll make all the decisions. You..

60
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:23,154
Who are you?
- Sengal, sir.

61
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:25,782
Who? - Remember, my son
was born in your car? It's him.

62
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:27,492
From Nochi Kuppam, right?
- Yes. - What do you want?

63
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:30,161
I came to distribute sweets as my son
stood first in the state in junior high..

64
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:31,287
Stop it!

65
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:34,290
An altercation is going on here
and he wants to celebrate it with sweets!

66
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:38,586
Look, don't try to cheat me
by allotting the seat to someone else.

67
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:41,381
There will be a proper reason
behind every decision I take.

68
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:43,800
My foot! Caste is the only reason
behind all your decisions!

69
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,594
Better rename the party
with your caste's name!

70
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,889
You are the reason we've become the
opposition party instead of the ruling party.

71
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:51,766
You are crossing your limits!
- Yes, I am.

72
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:55,019
If you allot the seat
to anyone else other than me

73
00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:57,146
I kill him as well as you!

74
00:03:57,563 --> 00:03:59,440
If you want to do the people
of your caste a favor

75
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,068
you better do something else!
Don't sell the party!

76
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,320
How dare you speak like that!

77
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:07,031
How dare you raise your voice
while speaking to me!

78
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:09,742
What makes you think
that you can be the MLA..

79
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:14,789
Rama?
Ramalingam?

80
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:28,302
In case he doesn't
give us a seat..

81
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,723
We were expecting some good news
but look at them fighting here!

82
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,225
It's okay, we can capture this
as news, too.

83
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:36,853
How can we trust
politicians like these?

84
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,900
Sengalvarayan.

85
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:45,695
Please take the blame.

86
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:49,657
I hope you understand what my plight
would be if I step out now?

87
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:52,618
This isn't my party.

88
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:53,995
It's a party nurtured by you.

89
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:57,540
The party will have no value
without me. - Sir..

90
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:58,958
If you take this blame

91
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:04,088
the world will believe that you got
emotional and did it for me!

92
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,590
Please accept the blame.

93
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:16,768
Listen, I'll bear the expenses
of your son's education!

94
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,436
I'll take care of your family, too!

95
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:21,647
It's your leader pleading,
Sengalvarayan.

96
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:26,486
Please don't worry.

97
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:28,112
Are you going
to take the blame, Dad?

98
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:30,823
I'll take the blame.

99
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:35,036
I'll have to serve a few years of punishment
at the Juvenile Detention Center.

100
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:37,914
In return, ask him
to give you the MLA post.

101
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:40,083
Bail me out
once you become the MLA.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,169
It's your mistake
that I was born poor

103
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:46,547
but if I die poor,
it would be my mistake.

104
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,301
I'll never let that happen, Dad.

105
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:53,721
Do you agree?

106
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,602
Go tell everyone that you are
allotting the seat to my father.

107
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:05,233
Dad, you also go out.

108
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,030
<i>15 year old arrested

what I'm running after."

113
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:01,247
"I'm the one
as dangerous as a gun."

114
00:07:01,414 --> 00:07:04,000
"Show me, who my rival is!"

115
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:07,045
"I am an army
and its leader too!"

116
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:10,715
"And that's the power
of the lone one!"

117
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:17,764
"If the lone one
makes up his mind"

118

Who are you all?
Are you from the kidnappers' gang?

Along with us, you have
kidnapped her as well! Poor soul!

140
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:39,864
She has been constantly
addressing me as her sister.

141
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:42,408
Hello.

142
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,160
Who are you?
- Here, talk to your husband.

143
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:46,954
These guys have kidnapped us!

144
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:49,499
Don't worry, Sivagami,
my brother will rescue you.

145
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:50,708
Don't worry.
- Okay.

146
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:57,090
Will you only rescue your first wife? You would
always say that I'm your life. Was that a lie?

147
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,384
Ammulu?
Have they kidnapped you as well?

148
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:02,178
You wretched woman!
So, you are the other woman, is it?

149
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:05,264
Stop calling me your sister!
Get lost!

150
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:08,851
Mom, she looks awesome!
- Shut up!

151
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:10,561
I am done for!
- He cheated me..

152
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:16,025
You said your brother will rescue us?
He is lying unconscious here!

153
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:18,194
What?
- Come soon and save us.

154
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,987
What did you guys
do to my brother?

155
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:21,989
Your brother?

156
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:23,241
He provoked me
to get into a fight with him.

157
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:25,618
I was running out of time,
and so, I knocked him out.

158
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:26,786
Hey, you!
- Listen.

159
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:29,080
It didn't take me
half an hour to kidnap them.

160
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:31,124
It will barely take me
five minutes to kill them.

161
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:32,542
Why are you doing all this?

162
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:36,295
I want you to bring the four kids
you have abducted, to the place I say.

163
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:38,339
Or else, you'll see
the end of your family.

164
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:53,646
Move!

165
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:02,530
Please come.

00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:21,049
I knew you would end up
doing something like this.

171
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:24,052
Ask your men to move back!

172
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:30,892
Dad..
- Come on! Quick!

173
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:33,728
Soumya..
- Open that door and round up!

174
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:37,231
<i>The abduction case
of businessman</i>

175
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:40,193
<i>Manickavel's daughter
and Dr. Ramanathan's daughter</i>

176
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:44,697
<i>along with four other kids,
has come to an end.</i>

177
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:51,621
<i>Based on the inputs from an informer,
the police nabbed the kidnappers.</i>

178
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:20,274
Shakthi..
- Yes?

179
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:21,943
How much should
I set the duration for?

180
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:24,737
Say 20 seconds.
We'll manage.

181
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:26,114
Seems like the training
has paid off!

182
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:39,711
Okay, bye.
- Bye. Good night.

183
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:10,992
Push!

184
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:12,827
Pull!

185
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:20,877
<i>We are relieved
now that our daughter is saved.</i>

186
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:26,716
<i>I thank the police and the government.
</i>- Sounds great. Isn't it?

187
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:27,967
<i>The kidnapped children..</i>

188
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:30,344
Awesome, dude!
- Shakthi.. What is it?

189
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,389
Pal, I am very happy!

190
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:35,892
After looking at the results

191
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,936
those sleepless nights rendered..

192
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:41,856
I feel like doing more of such stuff.
- Mithran..

193
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:44,817
<i>To become a cop, one doesn't require
power or the need to take oaths.</i>

194
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:48,654
<i>We become a cop the day
we decide to become one.</i>

195
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:52,784
It's your quote and every word
that you said is so true!

196
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:55,745
Thank you.
- Come on, dude!

197
00:13:56,996 --> 00:13:59,123
This wouldn't have been possible
without your involvement.

198
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,209
We were all like-minded
and it worked out.

199
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:03,503
If we keep up this spirit

200
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:05,713
we can make a huge difference.

201
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,590
Correct.
So, where is the show tonight?

202
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:08,925
Who are we taking care of?

203
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:11,761
Tonight, we aren't taking care
of anybody, but us. Get some rest!

204
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:25,983
Mithran, he is here.
Please be careful.

205
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,778
I involved you in this only because
of Mr. Ramalingam's recommendation.

206
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:30,488
Take care.

207
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:41,124
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

208
00:14:41,457 --> 00:14:42,458
Hi, sir.
- Hi.

209
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,918
Good evening.
- Hello.

210
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:47,922
I have invited you all
to share with you an important news.

211
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:49,340
Do you know what this is?

212
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:52,468
The Government Order to bring in
generic medicines to our state.

213
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,805
Our government and a foreign company
are pretty concerned about this.

214
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:58,182
If this gets implemented

215
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:01,436
the pharma industry
will witness a huge revolution.

216
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:04,272
Medicines worth thousand rupees
will be available for ten rupees.

217
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,858
It will be a blessing
for the poor and the needy.

218
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:10,486
Are you wondering
why I am sounding happy?

219
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:11,988
I'm troubled from within!

220
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:14,699
If we don't stop this immediately

221
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:17,577
you know
what the consequences will be.

222
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:19,912
How can you say this, sir?
- Sir, please do something.

223
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,581
We have pinned our hopes on you.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:23,291
We have to bribe a lot of people.

225
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,210
The donations you all have collected
in your medical colleges

226
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,921
the money that you have earned
from stolen kidney transplantations..

227
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:30,673
Get everything!

228
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:32,133
Or else

229
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:34,510
we'll lose everything
that we have earned so far.

230
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,846
Also, we won't be able
to earn like this hereafter.

231
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,391
Ten years ago

232
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,560
I had met a U.S. citizen.

233
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:45,063
I told him that here,
when we fall sick

234
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:49,067
we head to a well-known
private hospital.

235
00:15:50,193 --> 00:15:52,362
He was shocked on hearing this.

236
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,157
He asked me, how a private organization
could provide the facilities

237
00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:57,992
and the infrastructure similar to the ones
provided by the government.

238
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,120
It was like a slap on my face.

239
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:04,665
This moment made
a great impact on my life.

240
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,167
That's fine.

241
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,086
Ma'am, I would like
to share something.

242
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:09,420
Yes, Janardhan.

243
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:12,924
Mithran is the reason
behind my strong social views.

244
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:16,177
I once asked him as to how
he had gained so much knowledge.

245
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:17,845
He mustn't have wasted
a single moment in his life and that's why

246
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:19,097
it must have been possible.

247
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:20,223
This is what he replied.

248
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:22,850
<i>When Mumbai's Taj was attacked,
Ajmal Kasab was 18.</i>

249
00:16:23,393 --> 00:16:26,187
<i>The guy involved
in Delhi's rape case was 17.</i>

250
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:29,899
<i>Today, all the rogues and criminals
in this country are aged between 16 and 17.</i>

251
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:35,238
<i>Criminals don't wait for the right time
to learn and commit crimes.</i>

252
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:36,989
<i>But the righteous ones..</i>

253
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:38,533
<i>Only the ones who want
to do good deeds</i>

254
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:41,869
<i>keep waiting for the right moment
and situation.</i>

255
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:45,790
These words of his
made such a huge impact on me

256
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,084
that I've no words to express.

257
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:51,921
Hence, I like him
and he is my man.

258
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:53,756
What does he mean
by he is his man?

259
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,508
Jana, what are you blabbering?

260
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:56,592
Quiet, please.

261
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:59,929
Social views were very well discussed
by our various professionals.

262
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:02,265
<i>I know about your night ventures.</i>

263
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:05,476
<i>Tonight, if Mithran
doesn't come to the place I say..</i>

264
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:09,814
What new problem is this?

265
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:11,649
Who do you think
could have sent this?

266
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:14,110
If our superiors find out,
our posting will be banned.

267
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,614
I can thrash 40 of them in no time

268
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:22,910
but the very thought of being answerable
to an officer is making me tense.

269
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:25,872
Let's not blow this out of proportion.
How about ignoring it?

270
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:28,332
We must finish what we have started.

271
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,960
I completely agree with Mithran.

272
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:34,422
Excuse me. You are Mithran?
- Yes.

273
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:35,923
Please come in.

274
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:06,245
Hey!
Mahima is here.

275
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:11,667
Hey!
What is she doing here?

276
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:15,838
Could she have sent the SMS?

277
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,690
They seem to be having
a serious conversation.

278
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,823
Mithran..

279
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:43,533
Wait.

280
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:46,703
Was she the one
who had sent that message?

281
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,622
Yes. - What is the problem
between you both?

282
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:52,166
Ask her that question.
- Hey!

283
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:53,835
I will be waiting at the tea shop.
- Hey, come.

284
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,503
Come, let's ask her.

285
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:58,965
<i>With the dreams of becoming
an IPS officer like my father</i>

286
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:02,218
<i>I cleared my civil services exams
and was on my way to Mussoorie.</i>

287
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:05,763
<i>I met Mithran way before
I met you guys.</i>

288
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,268
"Brush your mustache gently."

289
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:13,354
"Wear your glasses like the boss."

290
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:16,274
"Mix yoghurt with coconut juice."

291
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,985
"Build up the mood."
- Come on, let's dance.

292
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:21,571
Over to Mahima.
"All the Rajini fans.."

293
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:22,822
Come, babe!

294
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,615
"Don't miss the chance."

295
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:27,035
"All the Rajini fans."

296
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:30,329
Wow!
- "Don't miss the chance."

297
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:36,252
"Loin cloth dance.."

298
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:41,215
Why are you girls
creating a ruckus?

299
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:45,511
We toiled hard
for two years to complete IPS.

300
00:19:45,678 --> 00:19:49,515
Later, we'll be serving you people.
Can't we enjoy one day?

301
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:53,394
Hey, a few guys are boozing
by the restroom!

302
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,439
Come here, first. - Spoilt brats!
- Go, old man! - Rubbish!

303
00:19:57,523 --> 00:20:01,069
Now, I really want to booze.
Do we have any booze?

304
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:03,696
No, right?
No matter what, boys are boys!

305
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:05,698
What rubbish are you talking?
What do you want now?

306
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:08,409
I want to booze.
- Me too!

307
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:11,245
Me too. - Fine, then.
Let's go raid them.

308
00:20:11,662 --> 00:20:13,122
Come..
- Come on, girls.

309
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:16,459
Come, let's follow them.
- Hey, where are you going?

310
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,629
Look at him,
he has already passed out!

311
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:21,839
How dare you guys
booze in the train!

312
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:25,718
Stop questioning us.
You don't know who we are!

313
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:31,057
3 IPS and 2 IAS officers are here.
This is a surprise squad.

314
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:36,020
One more word and we'll file charges
of rape and eve-teasing against you.

315
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:39,232
Get up!
You and you too!

316
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:40,692
Step aside.
- Sorry, ma'am.

317
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:41,984
We won't repeat this.
- Leave.

318
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:43,194
Okay, ma'am.

319
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:45,947
Clear everything. - Okay, ma'am.
- Move aside. - Leave.

320
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,073
She didn't mean you.
- She instructed us..

321
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,199
We'll take care of it.

322
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:49,492
Now, get lost.

323
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:53,538
Now, don't get all these back
to our seats. Finish them here itself.

324
00:20:55,415 --> 00:20:56,749
Hello.

325
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,043
What is it?

326
00:20:59,168 --> 00:21:00,086
Come with me.
- Give me the candy.

327
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:02,839
Didn't I already give you one? Get lost!
- Give me one more.

328
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:06,092
No, I won't.
- Listen, I am an IPS.

329
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:10,138
If you don't give me the candy,
I'll get you arrested on charges of rape.

330
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:11,848
What do you mean by rape?

331
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:13,224
I don't know what that is
but if you don't give me the candy..

332
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:16,936
All the fuss you created was not only
witnessed by the older generation

333
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:18,938
but also by the younger generation.

334
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,315
We should instill
only good thoughts in them.

335
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,528
Hi! - Give me the candy.
- I won't.

336
00:21:25,695 --> 00:21:27,405
You guys are playing the wrong way!

337
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:28,865
Is this how a cop behaves?

338
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:31,409
That's how that police officer
behaved with the guys.

339
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:34,245
Who is that? You mean that lady?
- Yes, her.

340
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:36,164
She isn't a police officer!

341
00:21:36,748 --> 00:21:38,666
Excuse me, you aren't
a police officer, are you?

342
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:40,752
No, I am not a police officer.

343
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,087
See, I told you.

344
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:46,174
Didn't I tell you earlier
that you are wrong?

345
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:47,592
You are correct, my dear.

346
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:51,429
A cop defends the nation
and fights for justice

347
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,265
and also ensures
that peace prevails all around.

348
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:57,143
Now, both of you stop fighting
and share the candy.

349
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,812
Okay? - Okay, sir.
- Now, go and play. - Okay, sir.

350
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:03,608
You can have the candy.
I promise not to fight.

351
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:06,194
I felt like slapping you
for your behavior

352
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,655
but then, even that would have
set a bad example.

353
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:14,535
Feminism isn't about competing
with men in their wrongdoings.

354
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:15,912
It is something else.

355
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:20,792
<i>I become furious when someone
points out my mistakes.</i>

356
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:22,794
<i>But somehow, this time</i>

357
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:26,506
<i>I regretted that I left
a bad impression on him.</i>

358
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:30,176
<i>By the time the train
arrived at Mussoorie Junction</i>

359
00:22:30,927 --> 00:22:32,136
<i>I had fallen for him.</i>

360
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:35,390
<i>I looked around for him
the next morning</i>

361
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:36,849
<i>but he was gone.</i>

362
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:40,228
<i>I thought that to be
our first and last meeting.</i>

363
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,481
<i>And with those memories,
I started my training.</i>

364
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:47,694
Dear students..

365
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:50,488
Welcome to the 88th Foundation Course.

366
00:22:50,655 --> 00:22:52,073
Governments may change

367
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,492
crumble
or even topple

368
00:22:54,742 --> 00:22:58,871
but the day-to-day life of the ordinary
common man goes on undisturbed

369
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:00,873
because of the executives.

370
00:23:01,332 --> 00:23:02,458
That's you.

371
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:05,461
The politicians may be the masters

372
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:08,339
but you are the actual rulers.

373
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,552
And now, I proudly
present before you

374
00:23:12,802 --> 00:23:14,929
the topper of All India
Civil Service exams.

375
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:16,848
Mr. Mithran from Tamil Nadu.

376
00:23:18,725 --> 00:23:21,519
It's indeed a great pleasure,
firstly for me

377
00:23:21,686 --> 00:23:24,480
as he comes
from the state where I belong to.

378
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,986
My Tamil has improved, right?
- Not better than mine.

379
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:32,780
Dad. - Meet Mahima, my daughter.
- Hello.

380
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:35,199
Such a disciplined girl.

381
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:38,202
Excuse me, sir.
- Dad.

382
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:40,788
An officer was looking for you.
- Is it? - Yes.

383
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:44,375
Okay, Mithran, see you. I thought
of telling you more about my daughter.

384
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,585
Maybe sometime later..
- Dad..

385
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:49,213
I think you should continue.
The officer can wait. - Is it so?

386
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,465
Please tell him about me, in detail.

387
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:53,509
She is the symbol of my pride!

388
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:55,511
Do you know how?

389
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:58,014
She has joined the IPS

390
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:01,392
but believe me, she was
very naughty in her childhood

391
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,102
and until she joined college.

392
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:05,188
Incidents like throwing stones
at the teacher

393
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:07,356
biting off the ears of the boy sitting
next to her and what not.. - Dad..

394
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:10,151
Is this what you've got to say?
- Not an issue, it's Mithran, after all.

395
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:12,779
"Love is a universal game."

396
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:15,114
"And I am a goner."

397
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:19,786
"I lost it the moment
I laid my eyes on you."

398
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:33,216
"Love is a universal game."

399
00:24:33,383 --> 00:24:35,385
"And I am a goner."

400
00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:40,431
"I lost it the moment
I laid my eyes on you."

401
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:45,353
"This is the time for romance
and my life lies in your hands."

402
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:50,650
"As I desperately wander behind you,
the world keeps laughing at it."

403
00:24:50,983 --> 00:24:53,111
"What do I do to convince you?"

404
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:55,738
"When will you accept me?"

405
00:24:56,114 --> 00:25:00,743
"Just tell me and I will
change myself for you."

406
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:14,090
Come on, guys, have some booze.

407
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:25,852
"I tried everything,
but nothing worked out."

408
00:25:26,018 --> 00:25:28,521
"I even tried seducing you, but you.."
- Come on, guys.

409
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:30,940
"...didn't even care to turn around and look."
- Have some booze.

410
00:25:31,107 --> 00:25:35,695
"I get so mad,
but I don't reveal it to you."

411
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:41,117
"I changed myself for you,
but you never noticed it."

412
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:46,164
"Yet, I will keep loving only you."

413
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:51,294
"My world will revolve around you,
no matter where you go."

414
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:53,755
"Love is a universal game."

415
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:56,215
"And I am a goner."

416
00:25:56,424 --> 00:26:01,220
"I lost it the moment
I laid my eyes on you."

417
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,681
A horse is trying
to ride another horse!

418
00:26:05,308 --> 00:26:06,184
What did he say?

419
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,478
He said that a horse is trying
to ride another horse!

420
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:11,647
Actually, I understood that
but see, I didn't react!

421
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:26,579
"All the beautiful women
are not wise."

422
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:31,459
"And all the wise women
will cheat on you."

423
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:36,547
"Look at me, I am the only one
who is both beautiful and wise."

424
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:41,677
"You don't understand my value
as I'm always around you."

425
00:26:42,178 --> 00:26:46,641
"Yet, I will keep loving only you."

426
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:51,729
"My world will revolve around you,
no matter where you go."

427
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:55,233
Hi.
- Hi.

428
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:56,734
Enjoying music?

429
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:57,985
No.
It's a news app.

430
00:26:58,653 --> 00:27:00,863
Since we are away
from Tamil Nadu

431
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:02,657
I just thought of finding out
what's happening there.

432
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:04,283
Looks like the trekking plan
got canceled.

433
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,037
Yes. It's been postponed to next week
due to heavy snowfall there.

434
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:10,081
Nice dress.

435
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:12,125
Thanks.

436
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:18,297
Okay, I am out of ideas.

437
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:23,261
I'm used to people
trying to impress me.

438
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,347
I've never wanted
to impress anyone.

439
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:28,349
That's not my forte.

440
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:33,438
I tried changing myself for you
and everything went down the drain.

441
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:35,189
I'm not someone who will
change for anyone.

442
00:27:35,356 --> 00:27:37,150
It's a great deal
that I even gave it a thought.

443
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,278
You understand everything
in a jiffy.

444
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:41,863
How come you are not able
to understand this?

445
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:46,367
I think

446
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:47,952
I'm in love with you.

447
00:27:49,746 --> 00:27:50,747
I..

448
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:52,665
I don't know how to propose.

449
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:54,792
So, kindly adjust if I didn't
put it across in the proper way.

450
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,211
I just spoke my mind.

451
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:01,299
You just said that you don't
know how to propose

452
00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:05,428
but I've never heard
a better proposal than this one.

453
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:08,473
Love.

454
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,142
I understand its value very well.

455
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,063
But my situation is such that
I can't respect it.

456
00:28:16,189 --> 00:28:17,482
You don't have to change yourself.

457
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:19,025
I like you very much the way you are.

458
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:21,527
But don't make me hate you
by mentioning your love for me, again.

459
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:25,448
Because I'm really not the kind
of person who will fall in love.

460
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:27,658
Let's not do this, Mahima.

461
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:28,993
My mind..

462
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,620
It's tuned in some other way.

463
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,748
I am serious,
so, don't take this lightly.

464
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,291
I hope you'll understand.

465
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,712
<i>When he is around</i>

466
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:42,673
<i>I know I can't control
my feelings for him.</i>

467
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:47,678
<i>At the same time, I was worried
that I might earn his hatred.</i>

468
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:52,892
<i>So, against my dad's wish, I discontinued
my training there and joined forensic.</i>

469
00:28:58,648 --> 00:28:59,857
Why did you guys bring her?

470
00:29:00,316 --> 00:29:01,317
What kind of a question is that?

471
00:29:01,484 --> 00:29:05,279
I thought of re-entering your life
but you just left the conversation midway!

472
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:08,866
Ice-cream! Ice-cream..
- You know that you are guilty!

473
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:13,037
Don't behave as if I've never
touched you before. Sit here.

474
00:29:13,204 --> 00:29:15,164
Come, sit here.
- Hey! - Come, I say.

475
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,001
What are you guys looking at?

476
00:29:20,253 --> 00:29:24,132
Look here, find out and tell me
why your friend left me.

477
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,301
If you don't, I'll let your seniors
know about your night ventures.

478
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:28,469
Understood?

479
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:32,140
Where are you guys going?
- To have tea.

480
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:36,352
Will you keep avoiding me
all your life? Is there no end to it?

481
00:29:36,936 --> 00:29:40,231
Will you keep chasing me
all your life? Is there no end to it?

482
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:42,859
Trying to convince you
won't work.

483
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:44,694
I can't believe,
he didn't tell us about it.

484
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:46,195
Don't argue. I'm sure

485
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:48,322
Mithran has his reasons.
- I forbade you from buying it.

486
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:49,407
We could've saved some money.
- You shouldn't compromise

487
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:50,658
on the dosage. - Oh, no!

488
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:52,076
Wait, I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

489
00:29:52,243 --> 00:29:53,911
It will fetch us
quite some money, boss.

490
00:29:54,412 --> 00:29:56,581
Hasn't the doctor asked you
to refrain from taking any strain?

491
00:29:57,457 --> 00:29:59,042
I don't think I ride the bike well.

492
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:00,752
I don't think so.
You ride just fine.

493
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:02,628
Thankfully, you saved me
at the right time.

494
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,013
Look there.

495
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,728
Give me that. - What do you want?
- What are you doing?

496
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:22,565
Leave him! - Finish him, quick.
- Dear!

497
00:30:22,774 --> 00:30:26,778
Don't!
- Please don't. Let him go!

498
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:28,905
Please don't!

499
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:34,118
Come on.

500
00:30:34,452 --> 00:30:35,370
Let's move, quick.

501
00:30:35,578 --> 00:30:36,871
Shakthi, follow them.

502
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:39,123
Fine. You take care of them.
- Dear!

503
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,627
Sir?
- Call for an auto.

504
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:49,217
He isn't breathing.

505
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:51,552
Suraj.. What happened?
- He is no more.

506
00:30:55,306 --> 00:30:58,184
Careful.
- Dear.. - Mahima..

507
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,311
There is a hospital
right after the next signal. - Okay.

508
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:01,729
Go. Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

509
00:31:01,938 --> 00:31:03,731
Here is the paper cutting in which
they had wrapped the weapon.

510
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,233
Darn it!
They've got away!

511
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,151
Shakthi is on the line.

512
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:09,070
It seems he lost them half way.
- Darn it!

513
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:10,613
Shakthi, listen to me.

514
00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:13,366
I aimed and hit one of the culprits with
my mobile. It has landed in his t-shirt.

515
00:31:13,574 --> 00:31:14,909
It's in the hood of his t-shirt.

516
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:19,038
Open the 'Find Friends' app
in your mobile.

517
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:21,124
Track my mobile and follow it.

518
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,337
It is detecting the signal!
- We are on our way. Let's stay connected.

519
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:33,010
They are heading towards Parry's.
Go fast.

520
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,061
Turn around.
- What is it?

521
00:31:42,228 --> 00:31:43,938
How did this get in here?
- A mobile phone?

522
00:31:44,147 --> 00:31:45,148
Whose phone is this?

523
00:31:45,982 --> 00:31:50,111
I felt someone hit me in the head. Someone
named Mahima is calling. - Switch it off!

524
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:56,409
The signal is lost!
- Darn it!

525
00:31:57,994 --> 00:32:01,956
Keep it inside. - The signal received last
was at a biriyani shop!

526
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:03,791
Let's meet at the next junction.

527
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,251
Okay, fine.

528
00:32:11,424 --> 00:32:13,843
Guys, we've covered all the directions.
That means, they haven't gone past us.

529
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:16,637
They should be surely somewhere in between
Mint Street and Chinnathambi Street.

530
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:18,389
There would be around
15 to 20 streets only.

531
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:19,599
Let's frisk all the streets.
- Okay.

532
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:31,486
Suraj!
Look here.

533
00:32:31,652 --> 00:32:32,904
Show me that.

534
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:35,031
It's the same one.
- He's trapped!

535
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:36,824
Mithran.
We saw the poster.

536
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:38,576
I think, we are
very close to them.

537
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:21,911
Where are you?
Wait, we'll come down.

538
00:33:22,912 --> 00:33:24,497
I have spotted two of them
from the crime scene.

539
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,709
Apart from them,
there are many more inside.

540
00:33:37,677 --> 00:33:39,303
Wait, I am coming.

541
00:33:39,595 --> 00:33:41,264
There is no signal..

542
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,938
Guys, we have got visitors.

543
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,625
Move!

544
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,079
Who are you all?

545
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:48,122
Tell me.
Who are you all?

546
00:34:49,123 --> 00:34:50,541
Are you going
to answer me or not?

547
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,212
Suraj!

548
00:34:55,463 --> 00:34:56,464
Bloody mongrel!

549
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:04,889
Others' lives mean
nothing to you, isn't it?

550
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:15,983
Superb!
- Awesome!

551
00:35:16,943 --> 00:35:18,611
We are solely responsible
for all the chain snatching incidents

552
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,613
that took place recently
in and around Ashok Nagar.

553
00:35:21,364 --> 00:35:23,449
In a similar attempt today

554
00:35:23,783 --> 00:35:25,243
we ended up killing a person.

555
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:28,621
How could they kill someone
so brutally for a chain?

556
00:35:28,746 --> 00:35:33,626
Hello! Why did you switch your phone off?
- The battery drained. How is she doing?

557
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:35,461
She is still grieving her husband's death.

558
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:37,547
Finally, she fell asleep
with the help of sedatives.

559
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:39,757
Fine. I'll talk to you later.
- Hello!

560
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:42,927
How mean of him!

561
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:45,805
Come, sir.
Please go in.

562
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:48,182
Come in.

563
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:49,851
It's my best friend's place.

564
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:51,686
Hold on. Put your right foot
forward first. - Why?

565
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:54,022
That's what he is doing.
Why are you confusing him?

566
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:55,523
Come, my friend.
Come.. Come.

567
00:35:57,191 --> 00:35:58,192
Please come.

568
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:00,194
She is my friend's grandma.

569
00:36:04,073 --> 00:36:05,616
Just wait for me right there!

570
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:09,787
Did you hear that?
The old lady asked you to wait for her.

571
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:11,205
You are a lucky fellow indeed!

572
00:36:11,372 --> 00:36:12,540
Naughty fellow!

573
00:36:13,082 --> 00:36:16,127
What is going on? Looks like you guys
and that old lady are up to something.

574
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:18,838
Wait. Ma'am..
- Hey, where is he going?

575
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:20,798
Mithran.
- Wait.

576
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:27,805
Now, this doesn't look
like your friend's house.

577
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:31,100
Oh!
So, you saw it?

578
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:34,312
This is my boyfriend.

579
00:36:35,396 --> 00:36:37,148
Built to take blows!

580
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,984
Whenever I am angry,
I take this

581
00:36:40,485 --> 00:36:41,903
and stab him.

582
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,988
Hadn't I vented my anger on this

583
00:36:44,155 --> 00:36:45,740
I would have stabbed you long back.

584
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:47,950
Now, don't invade my privacy.
Let's go out.

585
00:36:48,701 --> 00:36:50,411
Why did you guys bring me here
by deceit?

586
00:36:50,578 --> 00:36:53,456
To resolve your love issues.
- Look here.

587
00:36:53,831 --> 00:36:57,919
I can't forget him. I was away from him
for six months, respecting his words.

588
00:36:58,252 --> 00:37:00,296
I came to find out if he likes me
at least now.

589
00:37:01,672 --> 00:37:05,051
But here, the scenario is different.
You guys venture out in the night.

590
00:37:05,385 --> 00:37:07,178
He goes out alone sometimes
and meets strangers.

591
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:11,974
Alone? - Alone?
We always go out together.

592
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:14,977
What? Aren't you guys aware
that he sneaks out alone at times?

593
00:37:16,312 --> 00:37:17,480
Ask him if it isn't true.

594
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:20,149
Is it true?

595
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,568
Do you go out without us?

596
00:37:23,403 --> 00:37:25,571
Why are you silent?
Say something!

597
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:28,616
You guys are right
in questioning me

598
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:31,577
but there are
few other things in my life

599
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:34,038
which I don't want
to reveal to anyone.

600
00:37:34,706 --> 00:37:35,707
Mithran, listen.

601
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:44,590
The home minister said that he wants
to check out the new block.

602
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:46,759
I've already made the arrangements.
- Good.

603
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:56,310
Troop, order.
Start music.

604
00:38:22,712 --> 00:38:23,755
What is this?

605
00:38:31,596 --> 00:38:32,638
Were you looking for me?

606
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,140
Are you kidding me?

607
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:39,479
Four days ago, we saw him
brutally murder a person.

608
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:41,939
We risked our lives and handed him
over to the cops.

609
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:44,275
Now, we see him walking freely
inside our campus.

610
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:45,651
How is it possible?

611
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:49,655
I was supposed
to salute with pride.

612
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:51,866
But today, out of fear

613
00:38:53,076 --> 00:38:55,912
I had to hide my face
with that salute!

614
00:38:57,955 --> 00:38:58,873
It's even more infuriating

615
00:38:59,082 --> 00:39:03,878
to see you behave
as if nothing has happened.

616
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:08,508
Tell me, Mahi.

617
00:39:13,096 --> 00:39:14,389
I'm stepping out.
Do you guys want to join me?

618
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:16,432
Are you kidding?

619
00:39:16,682 --> 00:39:19,769
We won't come with you
unless you give us an explanation.

620
00:39:19,977 --> 00:39:21,854
Yes! We won't come
unless you speak up.

621
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:23,731
Remember Ramar who died
during the chain snatching incident?

622
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:26,943
His wife attempted suicide
and is in the hospital.

623
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:39,247
These are my friends.

624
00:39:39,455 --> 00:39:40,665
They were the ones
who helped us the other day.

625
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:42,625
What made you take such a step?

626
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:44,210
It seems they won't accept me
as the eye witness.

627
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:51,801
They said that the culprit was wearing a helmet
and hence, I identified the wrong person.

628
00:39:52,468 --> 00:39:55,471
When he walked out of the jail
this morning

629
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:59,225
he gave me a vicious look which suggested
that I could do him no harm.

630
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:02,186
I felt like a dead person
that very moment.

631
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:06,357
None of the cops or advocates
came to my rescue.

632
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:08,609
After all this

633
00:40:09,444 --> 00:40:11,237
why should I stay alive?

634
00:40:16,325 --> 00:40:17,368
What the heck is all this!

635
00:40:18,202 --> 00:40:19,287
It takes 40 years

636
00:40:19,495 --> 00:40:21,289
before the verdict for a genuine
clear cut case is passed.

637
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:22,957
But in a false case

638
00:40:23,332 --> 00:40:24,625
the criminal is proved innocent
by cheating the law

639
00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:27,420
and is released in just four days!
Atrocious!

640
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:32,925
After seeing all this, I wonder
what we are learning inside that campus!

641
00:40:34,844 --> 00:40:36,220
Have you decided not to speak up?

642
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,223
You don't even tell us
where you sneak out alone.

643
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:42,101
Your girlfriend, who loves
you more than anything..

644
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:43,436
You don't answer
her questions as well.

645
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:45,396
After all that has happened

646
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,357
you are still silent.

647
00:40:48,524 --> 00:40:49,734
Do you have any problem?

648
00:40:51,027 --> 00:40:52,111
Yes.

649
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:53,654
I have a problem.

650
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,574
Even now, whatever you just said
fell on deaf ears.

651
00:40:56,991 --> 00:41:00,036
Instead, my focus was on the atrocity
that was taking place behind you.

652
00:41:00,328 --> 00:41:01,412
That is my problem!

653
00:41:02,872 --> 00:41:03,831
There.

654
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,125
A couple of minutes ago,
the ambulance driver

655
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:12,507
drove down a victim past three government
hospitals to this private hospital

656
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:13,674
in greed of earning a few bucks
as commission. I noticed that.

657
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:14,926
That is my problem!

658
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:20,014
You guys are feeling bad just because
one of the criminals we caught is set free?

659
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:24,310
All the 32 criminals who we had caught
so far are roaming around freely.

660
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:27,980
So..

661
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:30,525
Does that mean,
all our efforts have gone in vain?

662
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:34,112
Not even a bit of it
has gone in vain.

663
00:41:36,114 --> 00:41:37,949
This has been my home
for the last ten years.

664
00:41:39,242 --> 00:41:40,326
This is my world.

665
00:41:41,202 --> 00:41:42,995
No one has come here before.

666
00:41:51,129 --> 00:41:52,422
<i>Define your enemy</i>

667
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:54,549
<i>and I will define you.</i>

668
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:57,510
What's all this?
Usually

669
00:41:57,969 --> 00:41:59,554
it is said that friends are the ones
who define an individual, right?

670
00:41:59,762 --> 00:42:00,722
Yes.

671
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:03,933
To know about your character,
one must know your friends.

672
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:08,146
But to know about your capacity,
you must know your enemies.

673
00:42:09,731 --> 00:42:11,232
Four days ago, he was our enemy.

674
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:13,109
Ramar, who he had killed

675
00:42:13,484 --> 00:42:16,112
was a social activist.

676
00:42:16,654 --> 00:42:20,616
I doubted if they murdered him
just for a chain.

677
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:22,910
Hence, I was very eager
to nab them that day.

678
00:42:23,536 --> 00:42:26,330
Based on the information
I extracted from there

679
00:42:26,873 --> 00:42:29,292
I came to know about the involvement
of this guy named Perumal Swamy.

680
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,754
No matter how many times we hand
the criminals over to the cops

681
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,213
he will bail them out.

682
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:36,382
He is the one
who hired the killer.

683
00:42:36,966 --> 00:42:38,092
But Mr. Ramar..

684
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:42,096
He got killed because of which one
of his many good deeds, no one knows.

685
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:47,060
But I found out the reason when I saw
the accused with the home minister today.

686
00:42:47,393 --> 00:42:51,064
Perumal Swamy and the home minister had planned
to acquire an area

687
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,107
on the outskirts of the city
for an enormous construction.

688
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:54,901
It was for the same area

689
00:42:55,068 --> 00:42:57,236
that Mr. Ramar had staged a protest,
citing that it should benefit the public.

690
00:42:57,737 --> 00:43:00,531
The area cops put an end
to all the chain snatching cases

691
00:43:00,698 --> 00:43:01,657
thinking that the culprit has been caught!

692
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:03,117
Now, tell me.

693
00:43:03,743 --> 00:43:05,953
Is he our enemy or is it him?

694
00:43:06,662 --> 00:43:08,081
You mean..
- Hold on.

695
00:43:08,748 --> 00:43:09,999
Look around.

696
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:13,252
Including the 32 crime cases we handled

697
00:43:13,753 --> 00:43:18,007
you'll see a detailed analysis of 500 crimes
that I doubted and investigated.

698
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:22,553
Behind every crime, there are
multi-levels of petty crimes involved

699
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,389
similar to that of the chain snatching crime.

700
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:27,350
Here..

701
00:43:27,558 --> 00:43:29,977
Remember the kids we rescued
from those kidnappers?

702
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:31,688
They weren't
kidnapped for ransom!

703
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,815
It was for this.

704
00:43:34,774 --> 00:43:36,359
Last month,
there was news that 18 children

705
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:39,195
had died due to short circuit
in the incubator

706
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:40,738
in a private hospital.
Remember?

707
00:43:40,905 --> 00:43:42,573
That wasn't the reason
for their death.

708
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:45,952
<i>Those children
were born with diabetes.</i>

709
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:48,454
<i>I fed them the medicine
that I used to feed them usually.</i>

710
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:52,291
<i>But within 10 minutes, all of them
died one after the other.</i>

711
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:54,877
<i>I panicked and reported
to the management immediately.</i>

712
00:43:55,128 --> 00:43:56,963
<i>They said that it was an accident</i>

713
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,257
<i>and that it would taint the image
of the hospital.</i>

714
00:43:59,465 --> 00:44:01,676
<i>Saying so, they threatened me
to follow their instructions.</i>

715
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:05,138
The process of testing
some new medicines

716
00:44:05,263 --> 00:44:06,764
resulted in the death of those babies.

717
00:44:06,973 --> 00:44:09,851
The fear of this secret
getting exposed

718
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:13,771
along with the other secrets of the ministry
and the foreign medical company

719
00:44:13,938 --> 00:44:15,982
made them cook up
the short circuit story.

720
00:44:16,399 --> 00:44:19,235
Mr. Ramanathan, an honest medical officer
wanted to report it

721
00:44:19,444 --> 00:44:22,155
but then, those kids were kidnapped
so that he would keep his mouth shut.

722
00:44:22,321 --> 00:44:24,198
To make it look
like a kidnapping for ransom

723
00:44:24,365 --> 00:44:26,951
they kidnapped other innocent kids
along with his kids.

724
00:44:27,577 --> 00:44:30,038
This medical mafia
is headed by Ashok Pandian.

725
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,833
The petty crimes which we look upon
as emotional crimes

726
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:36,252
actually has an organized crime
carried out in the background.

727
00:44:36,419 --> 00:44:40,965
How can we be so sure
about that in all the cases?

728
00:44:41,174 --> 00:44:43,885
I didn't mean to say that there's always
a big crime behind petty crimes.

729
00:44:44,302 --> 00:44:46,304
But in the foreground
of the organized crimes

730
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:49,515
there is a petty crime
which is used as an eyewash.

731
00:44:50,183 --> 00:44:52,685
I didn't start
this detailed analysis recently.

732
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:54,896
I had started it off
when I was just 15.

733
00:44:56,189 --> 00:44:59,650
We believe the world
is what the news shows us.

734
00:45:00,068 --> 00:45:02,111
Looks like I have got to know
a lot about such stuff.

735
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:03,446
One fine day

736
00:45:03,821 --> 00:45:08,368
I started relating to the news
in page 2 and page 6.

737
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:11,329
If there is a news
on truck strike on page 2

738
00:45:11,496 --> 00:45:13,706
on page 6, there would be one
that states a hike in the price of onions.

739
00:45:13,998 --> 00:45:16,000
On one page, if the news
is on gold price hike

740
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:17,752
the other page talks about 'Akshaya Trithiya',
the festival that celebrates purchase of gold

741
00:45:17,919 --> 00:45:18,961
being extended
for another two days.

742
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,380
On one page, if it's about someone
giving donation to a party

743
00:45:20,546 --> 00:45:22,590
the other page has news published
that one of his men is released.

744
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:25,593
I got furious and started
a deeper analysis.

745
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:28,721
We hardly pay attention
to the business section of the paper.

746
00:45:29,138 --> 00:45:31,516
That is the section that provides
news to all other sections.

747
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:36,104
We blindly believe in the news
that is in the favor of the businessmen.

748
00:45:36,813 --> 00:45:39,065
The brand of water you should drink,
the course you should choose to specialize in

749
00:45:39,232 --> 00:45:41,025
the charges of a particular treatment..

750
00:45:41,192 --> 00:45:42,777
All these are decided
by some businessman.

751
00:45:43,695 --> 00:45:46,197
When I try sharing
this frustration with someone

752
00:45:46,572 --> 00:45:49,992
they in turn, question me asking
if it has affected me in any way.

753
00:45:51,244 --> 00:45:52,662
That's when I made up my mind.

754
00:45:53,037 --> 00:45:54,455
That I should be a lone man.

755
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:57,792
I had to become a policeman to use it
as a weapon to vent my frustration.

756
00:45:58,751 --> 00:45:59,794
In the current situation

757
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:03,005
it might be the politicians
who define the fate of the people.

758
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:06,759
But the fate of every politician
is decided by the businessmen.

759
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:09,804
All these 500 crimes are committed
with the greedy motive of business.

760
00:46:09,971 --> 00:46:11,431
<i>Newspaper cuttings
on land grabbing, rowdyism</i>

761
00:46:11,597 --> 00:46:13,016
<i>manhandling, corruption
and business rivalries.</i>

762
00:46:13,182 --> 00:46:14,517
But only 15 people

763
00:46:15,184 --> 00:46:16,310
are behind all this.

764
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:20,773
To punish the criminals in these 500 cases,
we have 5000 cops.

765
00:46:21,274 --> 00:46:23,901
But there is not a single force
to punish these 15 individuals.

766
00:46:24,444 --> 00:46:26,446
I have an important goal in life.

767
00:46:27,447 --> 00:46:31,868
I want to destroy the one who has committed
the maximum number of crimes among these 15.

768
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:34,996
The destruction of whom will result
in the destruction of 100 criminals.

769
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,664
I want to destroy
that one criminal.

770
00:46:36,831 --> 00:46:38,624
I see him as my qualified enemy!

771
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:41,210
I want to show my wrath on him

772
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:44,047
and finish him nice and slow.

773
00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:48,509
In 10 days' time, we will
get to know about our postings.

774
00:46:49,302 --> 00:46:51,345
By then, I would have
chosen my enemy.

775
00:46:53,097 --> 00:46:54,098
But then..

776
00:46:54,557 --> 00:46:55,933
How are you going to select him?

777
00:46:57,435 --> 00:46:59,145
They are the 15 individuals
I was talking about.

778
00:46:59,312 --> 00:47:03,733
They have nurtured the idea of doing wrong
in the right way and then, get away with it.

779
00:47:05,777 --> 00:47:06,944
These three among them

780
00:47:07,487 --> 00:47:09,906
are responsible
for 80 percent of the crimes.

781
00:47:10,198 --> 00:47:11,157
<i>Ashok Pandian.</i>

782
00:47:11,324 --> 00:47:15,495
The business monopoly of all the pharmas,
medical colleges and hospitals lies with him.

783
00:47:15,661 --> 00:47:19,123
He decides which medicine every doctor
in the town should prescribe.

784
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,917
He is responsible for hundreds
of deaths due to medicine testing

785
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:22,877
and organ transplantation.

786
00:47:23,002 --> 00:47:23,920
<i>Charles Chelladurai.</i>

787
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:26,130
He specializes in smuggling
natural resources.

788
00:47:26,297 --> 00:47:27,882
Smuggling of minerals and sand.

789
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:31,344
He tops the list
in all the major granite scams.

790
00:47:31,552 --> 00:47:35,098
He has robbed
the government of billions.

791
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,307
<i>Perumal Swamy.</i>

792
00:47:36,557 --> 00:47:40,603
The guy who supplies henchmen to all
the 15 individuals I had mentioned earlier.

793
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,648
The one who does land grabbing,
murders and robbery for money.

794
00:47:43,856 --> 00:47:46,192
The one and only authority
for real estate and contract killers.

795
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:47,944
One of these three..

796
00:47:48,111 --> 00:47:50,947
The one who is invincible..

797
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,576
I will feed my ego and wrath by showing him
that he can be conquered, too!

798
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:59,747
In order to stop the inspection
in his granite quarry, Charles Chelladurai

799
00:47:59,914 --> 00:48:02,125
has arranged a meeting
with the resource minister.

800
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:05,336
I'll collect details
about that meet

801
00:48:06,129 --> 00:48:07,296
and arrive at a conclusion.

802
00:48:08,423 --> 00:48:09,924
I can't believe all this.

803
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:11,342
You are just brilliant!

804
00:48:11,551 --> 00:48:16,264
Once we get our posting, we all
will head in different directions

805
00:48:17,223 --> 00:48:19,934
but whenever you need us,
remember that we are just a call away.

806
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:22,729
The next moment, all of us
will be standing beside you.

807
00:48:27,108 --> 00:48:29,193
<i>R. Sengalvarayan, Resource Minister.</i>

808
00:49:55,405 --> 00:49:57,865
Greetings, Mr. Land Grabber.
- How do you do, sir?

809
00:49:58,032 --> 00:49:58,991
Greetings, Mr. Scam King.

810
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,618
Greetings, sir.
- How do you do?

811
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:04,372
Stop this stupid custom of a human
prostrating before another human.

812
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:08,084
I am happy that Mr. Sidharth
finally gave us an appointment.

813
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:10,420
He is my son and even I haven't
met him in two months.

814
00:50:10,586 --> 00:50:12,171
What are you saying, sir?
- I meant to say, I was busy.

815
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:15,633
I hardly get enough time
to solve the problems of the public.

816
00:50:16,134 --> 00:50:19,637
Until the daily crisis of the public
is eradicated completely

817
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:22,015
I won't eat or rest.

818
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:46,414
Hope you are fine, dear Siddhu.

819
00:50:46,873 --> 00:50:49,083
Did I disturb you guys, Shilpa?

820
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:52,045
What is this? Can't you leave
him alone for sometime?

821
00:50:52,211 --> 00:50:53,379
All of you are here.

822
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:54,505
Shilpa.

823
00:50:54,714 --> 00:50:56,466
I had called them here.
A small meeting.

824
00:50:56,716 --> 00:50:57,759
Then, I am all yours.

825
00:50:58,259 --> 00:51:00,094
I'll be waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

826
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:16,277
I don't think she is wrong.
You should take care of your health, too.

827
00:51:16,444 --> 00:51:17,528
I will, Dad.

828
00:51:17,737 --> 00:51:20,990
Since the last two months, these three have
been trying to get an appointment with you..

829
00:51:21,783 --> 00:51:23,618
Let me get on
with my party business.

830
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:25,286
You guys carry on
with the meeting.

831
00:51:25,661 --> 00:51:26,871
Is that fine, dear?

832
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:33,961
Looks like you stayed in the lab
for two months without any break.

833
00:51:34,128 --> 00:51:38,007
I've my reasons. - I thought I would deal with
the problem without having to approach you.

834
00:51:38,299 --> 00:51:39,384
But I couldn't.

835
00:51:39,842 --> 00:51:42,595
Angelina is bent on coming to India.

836
00:51:43,137 --> 00:51:46,683
I tried my best, but I couldn't
convince her. - I'll take care of that.

837
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:47,850
Sir, I've a concern
that I would like to share.

838
00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:51,145
Murali got arrested
in the Ramar case..

839
00:51:59,987 --> 00:52:01,531
Don't be careless.

840
00:52:02,156 --> 00:52:03,032
December 10th

841
00:52:03,366 --> 00:52:04,283
is a very important day.

842
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:05,785
Be prepared!

843
00:52:06,536 --> 00:52:08,079
Ashok, come here.

844
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:14,794
Ashok, we have to handle
this Angelina issue in a different way.

845
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:15,920
Sure.

846
00:52:20,967 --> 00:52:21,968
May I?
- Go ahead.

847
00:52:28,808 --> 00:52:29,892
No, dear..

848
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:32,562
Don't cry.
- Not bad, he seems healthy.

849
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,064
He is the reason
for our successful medicine testing.

850
00:52:36,232 --> 00:52:38,276
It's just that the lives
of 18 children had to be sacrificed.

851
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:45,074
Put him back at his place.
- Okay.

852
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:47,160
We'll have to review
every month.

853
00:52:47,744 --> 00:52:50,246
Give some convincing reasons
to his parents. - Okay.

854
00:52:50,413 --> 00:52:51,622
I'll miss you.

855
00:52:52,415 --> 00:52:53,750
I'll miss you.

856
00:52:59,005 --> 00:53:03,009
What did he say? - Follow these orders
on December 10th. - Okay.

857
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:11,267
Till this master plan is executed

858
00:53:11,434 --> 00:53:12,977
make sure you don't
get yourself into any trouble.

859
00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:14,771
Fine.
I'll take care of that.

860
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:29,660
<i>Padmashree Sri Sidharth Abhimanyu,
man of chemical miracle. - One can talk..</i>

861
00:53:29,827 --> 00:53:31,704
<i>His innovative contribution towards..
- It's a great honor to welcome..</i>

862
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:35,583
<i>In the pharma field..
- The great scholar and scientist..</i>

863
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:38,169
<i>He is well known across the globe.
- That's him.</i>

864
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:49,347
What is happening in my life?

865
00:53:49,806 --> 00:53:52,266
I thought, I'll choose
one of those three as my enemy.

866
00:53:53,017 --> 00:53:55,603
Now, I have got one who is equal
to those three put together.

867
00:53:55,853 --> 00:53:57,897
He is a Science genius
for the outside world.

868
00:53:58,272 --> 00:54:00,650
But with the help
of these three people

869
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:02,819
he is solely controlling
the medical mafia

870
00:54:02,985 --> 00:54:04,862
thereby ruling the world of crime.

871
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:09,575
Yesterday, our chief minister shows up
uninvited to a function, headed by him.

872
00:54:09,826 --> 00:54:12,995
<i>Despite his busy schedule,
he is attending the function.</i>

873
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:14,288
I am very sure

874
00:54:14,622 --> 00:54:17,375
there is some kind of an understanding
between those two.

875
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:19,419
He killed the chain snatching criminal
whom we had got arrested

876
00:54:19,585 --> 00:54:21,462
so that his arrest
doesn't create a loop hole.

877
00:54:21,754 --> 00:54:23,256
He made use of his body as well

878
00:54:23,423 --> 00:54:25,299
by tattooing on its chest,
a caste's name

879
00:54:25,466 --> 00:54:27,176
sparking a riot in Madurai

880
00:54:27,343 --> 00:54:29,345
which in turn, prevented
the inspection of his site.

881
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,597
Look, what they found
this morning.

882
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:34,475
They found a headless body
in Madurai.

883
00:54:35,393 --> 00:54:36,769
Next, they will find the head.

884
00:54:37,603 --> 00:54:38,646
As young scientists..

885
00:54:38,813 --> 00:54:42,734
He talks about the riot he had sparked
and earns the applause!

886
00:54:44,277 --> 00:54:45,445
December 10th..

887
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:48,614
He claimed it to be
an important day in his life.

888
00:54:50,575 --> 00:54:53,244
I will change it
into an unforgettable day for him.

889
00:54:53,619 --> 00:54:55,246
<i>He might be Sidharth now.</i>

890
00:54:55,413 --> 00:54:56,706
<i>Back then, he was Pazhani.</i>

891
00:54:56,873 --> 00:55:00,585
<i>I've stood by him
ever since his father became the MLA.</i>

892
00:55:01,085 --> 00:55:02,712
<i>He was released from jail.</i>

893
00:55:02,879 --> 00:55:04,297
<i>He was a kid then.</i>

894
00:55:05,006 --> 00:55:06,299
<i>This is what his father asked him..</i>

895
00:55:06,674 --> 00:55:08,134
<i>So, you are back from jail?</i>

896
00:55:08,301 --> 00:55:10,553
<i>Now, go ahead and become a gangster.</i>

897
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:12,764
<i>His son got furious and replied</i>

898
00:55:12,972 --> 00:55:15,183
<i>I will kill you!</i>

899
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,977
<i>You better clear my records
and send me to a nice college.</i>

900
00:55:18,144 --> 00:55:19,896
<i>I want to study.</i>

901
00:55:20,188 --> 00:55:21,481
<i>He is a very intelligent fellow.</i>

902
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:23,775
<i>Education on one hand
and crimes on the other.</i>

903
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:25,151
<i>He became his father's adviser.</i>

904
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:26,527
<i>He was an all-rounder, sir!</i>

905
00:55:29,197 --> 00:55:31,532
You are always thinking
about Sidharth.

906
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:32,700
Suppose..

907
00:55:33,201 --> 00:55:35,078
In four days, we have
our swearing-in ceremony.

908
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:37,705
Imagine that you never
come across him in your life.

909
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:38,998
Hypothetically..

910
00:55:39,332 --> 00:55:42,085
What would you do?
- We both will definitely meet each other.

911
00:55:43,211 --> 00:55:45,755
More crimes are committed
where wealth is in abundance.

912
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:49,384
His life is all about chasing wealth

913
00:55:50,593 --> 00:55:53,221
whereas my life is all about
chasing crimes.

914
00:55:54,222 --> 00:55:55,932
Hence, we are destined
to meet each other.

915
00:55:56,474 --> 00:55:58,851
He was born solely
to be ruined by me!

916
00:56:00,353 --> 00:56:02,397
A passion so deadly
to destroy someone!

917
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:05,441
But you are right. I was at
the subdirector's office just now.

918
00:56:05,983 --> 00:56:09,362
They asked me to handover this invitation
to the director. Check it out.

919
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:18,871
Is Sidharth indeed the chief guest?
- Yes.

920
00:56:23,334 --> 00:56:25,878
Parade march!

921
00:56:33,261 --> 00:56:35,471
Parade dismissed!

922
00:56:36,973 --> 00:56:38,433
We welcome our chief guest

923
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:40,893
Padmashree
Mr. Sidharth Abhimanyu

924
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,438
a great scholar
and a renowned scientist.

925
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:46,357
His innovative contributions
to forensic science..

926
00:56:46,524 --> 00:56:48,067
You lucky fellow..

927
00:56:48,651 --> 00:56:49,944
He isn't pleased yet.

928
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:53,990
He wants Sidharth to present him
the badge instead of the home minister.

929
00:56:54,198 --> 00:56:56,284
Now, that's too much!
- ...the special address.

930
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:01,456
Honorable Minister

931
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:04,417
Respected Officers
on the dias and in the audience..

932
00:57:05,376 --> 00:57:06,335
Ladies and gentlemen..

933
00:57:06,627 --> 00:57:07,712
And of course

934
00:57:08,004 --> 00:57:09,422
the future of our police force.

935
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:14,052
A question I'm frequently asked
wherever I go..

936
00:57:14,218 --> 00:57:15,386
What is the secret
of my success?

937
00:57:15,553 --> 00:57:16,679
It's actually very simple.

938
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:19,432
In your lifetime,
think of one good idea

939
00:57:21,768 --> 00:57:23,686
and make that idea your life!

940
00:57:25,063 --> 00:57:26,105
Think about it.

941
00:57:27,106 --> 00:57:28,441
All the very best.

942
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:30,318
Jai Hind.

943
00:57:32,612 --> 00:57:35,490
Now, I request
the medal winners to come forward.

944
00:57:35,656 --> 00:57:40,578
Mr. Ranjith IPS who has passed with
distinction in Cyber Cell Specialization.

945
00:57:41,746 --> 00:57:43,247
Next, Mr. Mithran IPS

946
00:57:43,414 --> 00:57:44,499
will receive the medal

947
00:57:44,665 --> 00:57:47,168
from the honorable home minister
Mr. Prakash.

948
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:49,712
Mr. Mithran receives this award

949
00:57:49,962 --> 00:57:54,342
as he has specialized in managing
activities involving organized crimes

950
00:57:54,509 --> 00:57:56,135
such as white-collar crimes

951
00:57:56,302 --> 00:57:58,429
financial crimes
and political crimes.

952
00:58:04,686 --> 00:58:05,812
Mr. Mithran

953
00:58:06,062 --> 00:58:07,563
has one more honor to receive.

954
00:58:07,855 --> 00:58:11,651
It's the special award for the overall
best probationer of the batch

955
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:14,654
which the Chief Guest
Padmashree Sidharth will present.

956
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:17,573
I would now request Mr. Sidharth
to present the award.

957
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:21,035
Mr. Mithran
has topped various drill movements

958
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:22,453
such as weapon training

959
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,497
firing,
unarmed combat

960
00:58:24,664 --> 00:58:25,915
and special tactics.

961
00:58:26,332 --> 00:58:30,712
Now, Mr. Mithran receives the home minister's
pistol from the chief guest.

962
00:58:31,504 --> 00:58:32,547
Beretta..

963
00:58:33,548 --> 00:58:35,800
Beautiful pistol.
- That too presented by you.

964
00:58:36,759 --> 00:58:38,219
What else can I ask for?

965
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:39,512
Wish you the very best.

966
00:58:40,013 --> 00:58:40,972
Do well.
- Sure, sir.

967
00:58:41,347 --> 00:58:42,265
Even I have an idea.

968
00:58:43,391 --> 00:58:44,559
Just like you said

969
00:58:45,226 --> 00:58:46,811
I will make it my life
and be successful.

970
00:58:46,978 --> 00:58:48,271
Congratulations.

971
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:01,534
Usually, a police targets the criminals
after taking charge.

972
00:59:01,701 --> 00:59:04,579
But I had already set my target
even before I took charge.

973
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:07,290
So, there is no time
to get introduced.

974
00:59:07,957 --> 00:59:09,667
You just have to believe me.
- Sure, sir.

975
00:59:09,876 --> 00:59:11,044
Because I believe in you

976
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:13,254
not because I'm the ASP
of the organized crime unit.

977
00:59:13,463 --> 00:59:17,091
I've assembled this team
at special request. - Thank you, sir.

978
00:59:17,341 --> 00:59:19,260
These three are the big shots
of the society

979
00:59:19,802 --> 00:59:21,596
but actually,
a big threat to our society.

980
00:59:23,514 --> 00:59:24,557
Your only job

981
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,060
is to follow them 24/7

982
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,146
and collect every possible evidence
against them.

983
00:59:31,064 --> 00:59:32,190
Sure, sir.

984
00:59:52,752 --> 00:59:56,381
It is true that a transaction
of 6 billion happened among those three.

985
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:58,341
The amount will be transferred
to Swiss accounts

986
00:59:58,508 --> 00:59:59,842
and they are heading to Mauritius.

987
01:00:00,009 --> 01:00:02,011
We don't know anything else
apart from that.

988
01:00:03,137 --> 01:00:04,347
On December 10th

989
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:06,224
combining all the three accounts

990
01:00:06,516 --> 01:00:10,228
nearly 7.5 billion has been requested
to be transferred to our Mauritius branch.

991
01:00:10,645 --> 01:00:13,064
I'm revealing all this
because you pressurized.

992
01:00:13,523 --> 01:00:15,191
That's all, sir.
- Thank you.

993
01:00:16,901 --> 01:00:20,279
There is no space in the hospital to treat
five percent of the patients who are poor.

994
01:00:20,738 --> 01:00:21,906
During the waiting stage,
the cancer turns severe

995
01:00:22,115 --> 01:00:23,866
for the rest of the 95 percent

996
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:26,411
and then, no medicine is available
in India, for the severe stage.

997
01:00:26,577 --> 01:00:27,745
We have to rely
on foreign drugs.

998
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,247
Only because of this

999
01:00:29,414 --> 01:00:33,000
the foreign companies tie up with
Indian companies and play around!

1000
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:36,462
The meeting scheduled for 10th December
will change everyone's fate for good!

1001
01:00:36,629 --> 01:00:38,715
You will find the details you asked
regarding the same in this file.

1002
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:43,970
Once Angelina signs the agreement
no one will be able to play around.

1003
01:00:44,303 --> 01:00:46,514
Medicines worth 2.5 lakhs
will be available for Rs. 8000.

1004
01:00:46,723 --> 01:00:49,142
Medicines worth 50 rupees
will be available for one rupee!

1005
01:00:49,308 --> 01:00:50,560
This should happen, sir.

1006
01:00:57,358 --> 01:00:59,694
Ms. Angelina is on her way
to the hotel from the airport.

1007
01:01:06,784 --> 01:01:07,744
Sir.
- Sir.

1008
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:10,038
Please wait here for a while, Doctor.
- Sure, sir.

1009
01:01:10,204 --> 01:01:12,290
Yes? - Sir, ma'am reached here
an hour ago. She is in her room.

1010
01:01:12,874 --> 01:01:15,084
We have been safeguarding her
from the time she left the airport.

1011
01:01:15,293 --> 01:01:16,544
We have informed her
that you would like to meet her.

1012
01:01:16,711 --> 01:01:18,379
Hi.
- Good. Hi, ma'am.

1013
01:01:18,713 --> 01:01:22,800
Last year, when my dad was in India
for a medical conference

1014
01:01:23,134 --> 01:01:24,886
I just came along as a tourist.

1015
01:01:25,053 --> 01:01:29,766
That's when I learnt about
the poor people dying from cancer.

1016
01:01:30,141 --> 01:01:34,270
The critical cancer medicine KE-27
required to rescue their lives

1017
01:01:34,479 --> 01:01:38,775
was sold by us at a higher price for 20 years,
in the name of patent rights

1018
01:01:38,941 --> 01:01:40,109
and I felt guilty about it.

1019
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:42,236
Once I became the managing director

1020
01:01:42,487 --> 01:01:44,280
I broke the patent rights
for the medicine and made up my mind

1021
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:48,034
to make it available for the poor
as a generic medicine.

1022
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:50,661
Just because of your effort alone

1023
01:01:50,828 --> 01:01:54,540
people here will be forced
to stop the misuse of patents.

1024
01:01:54,707 --> 01:01:56,667
The rates of the medicines
will fall drastically.

1025
01:01:56,834 --> 01:01:58,711
But the Indian drug mafia
won't let that happen.

1026
01:02:03,257 --> 01:02:04,342
Do you recognize him?

1027
01:02:05,176 --> 01:02:07,261
He is Sidharth,
our Indian adviser.

1028
01:02:08,012 --> 01:02:09,472
Do you know
who he is talking to?

1029
01:02:09,889 --> 01:02:11,933
Our company's Vice President,
James Anderson.

1030
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,435
This photo was taken
when they had met in Switzerland.

1031
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:17,605
A transaction worth 13 billion
is getting transferred to an account

1032
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:19,482
in your country
by Sidharth's proxies.

1033
01:02:19,899 --> 01:02:23,152
Do you see any connection between
their meeting and the transaction?

1034
01:02:23,528 --> 01:02:24,487
There are chances.

1035
01:02:24,779 --> 01:02:28,574
Sidharth came with a request to merge
his pharmaceutical company with mine.

1036
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:31,369
Since I refused, I guess,
he is teaming up with Anderson

1037
01:02:31,536 --> 01:02:32,870
to buy 51 percent
of my company's shares

1038
01:02:33,037 --> 01:02:35,081
that will make him
the deciding authority.

1039
01:02:35,456 --> 01:02:38,376
You know
your life is at risk.

1040
01:02:39,711 --> 01:02:40,753
Don't worry.

1041
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:43,297
It's my duty to ensure your safety.

1042
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:44,799
Thank you.

1043
01:02:45,008 --> 01:02:46,884
Tomorrow, it's 10th December.

1044
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:49,554
A day that will give meaning
to the team we have formed.

1045
01:02:49,721 --> 01:02:52,223
A day that will change
the fate of patients who are poor.

1046
01:02:52,432 --> 01:02:56,227
But this will happen only if Angelina
attends the Chennai meeting safely.

1047
01:02:56,436 --> 01:02:59,522
There is a plan to murder Angelina
and to takeover her company.

1048
01:02:59,981 --> 01:03:04,152
For this purpose, 13 billion is going to be
transferred through banks and Hawalas.

1049
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,404
We will have to follow
two strategies.

1050
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:08,865
The first one..
We have to ensure Angelina's safety

1051
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:11,826
and make sure that
she attends the meeting.

1052
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,996
Secondly..
By arresting these three

1053
01:03:15,204 --> 01:03:18,082
we'll have to stop the transaction
of the 13 billion fund.

1054
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:22,462
We must arrest all three of them
at the same time!

1055
01:03:32,722 --> 01:03:33,723
Hi, Stephen.

1056
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:36,225
Nice to meet you.
- How are you? Good to see you.

1057
01:03:37,226 --> 01:03:38,186
Shall we?
- Come.

1058
01:03:41,356 --> 01:03:46,486
Why did you bring me here and what's
with the new dress? What's up?

1059
01:03:48,363 --> 01:03:49,781
You bought her the same dress!

1060
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:52,575
This is Angelina. - Hello.
- The MD of the foreign medical company.

1061
01:03:52,825 --> 01:03:54,786
She has an important conference
to attend today.

1062
01:03:54,952 --> 01:03:56,829
There is a threat to her life.

1063
01:03:56,996 --> 01:03:58,039
So what?

1064
01:03:58,956 --> 01:04:01,667
So, if you travel instead of her
in the car, she'll be safe..

1065
01:04:01,834 --> 01:04:04,629
When I said I'm ready
to sacrifice my life for you

1066
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:06,130
I didn't expect you would
actually put my life at risk.

1067
01:04:06,297 --> 01:04:09,008
Mahima, this is a secret operation
and you belong to a family of police officers

1068
01:04:09,175 --> 01:04:11,636
you can think spontaneously
and you are pretty talented.. - Fine, enough.

1069
01:04:12,011 --> 01:04:14,514
You have made up your mind.
I'll do it!

1070
01:04:15,264 --> 01:04:16,265
What is she saying?

1071
01:04:16,432 --> 01:04:18,643
I'm saying that I'm very happy
to do this for you.

1072
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,603
Thank you
- You're welcome.

1073
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:24,899
See you.
- Take care.

1074
01:04:26,484 --> 01:04:27,527
Pramod, all set?

1075
01:04:44,252 --> 01:04:46,212
Mithran.
Where are you?

1076
01:04:46,379 --> 01:04:47,630
I'm following you.

1077
01:04:54,053 --> 01:04:55,138
Sir, we are moving ahead

1078
01:04:55,263 --> 01:04:57,223
and everything is clear.
Over.

1079
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:02,186
Thank you for the warm welcome.
- You are welcome.

1080
01:05:02,353 --> 01:05:03,521
And for the opportunity.

1081
01:05:03,771 --> 01:05:05,982
I think it's going to be
a great value proposition.

1082
01:05:21,873 --> 01:05:24,292
Sir, I see Perumal Swamy
on the road opposite.

1083
01:05:24,459 --> 01:05:26,002
But nothing looks suspicious.

1084
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:27,420
He won't be there
without any reason!

1085
01:05:27,587 --> 01:05:28,504
Something is fishy.

1086
01:05:28,713 --> 01:05:30,256
Okay, keep watching.

1087
01:05:31,424 --> 01:05:33,843
Pandian, be alert.
- Okay, sir.

1088
01:05:43,394 --> 01:05:44,604
Guys, be alert.

1089
01:05:58,451 --> 01:05:59,452
Arrest him.
- Take him..

1090
01:06:08,461 --> 01:06:09,545
Mahima?

1091
01:06:09,754 --> 01:06:12,090
Mahima!
Mahima!

1092
01:06:16,177 --> 01:06:17,387
Was that a prank?

1093
01:06:17,595 --> 01:06:19,389
Yes.
- Is this the time to joke?

1094
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:23,559
You can make me a scapegoat
anytime and I should obey you!

1095
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:28,398
I was checking if you were trying
to get rid of me forever!

1096
01:06:28,898 --> 01:06:31,025
Not bad.
You do have some concern for me!

1097
01:06:31,234 --> 01:06:33,236
Now, leave!

1098
01:06:35,655 --> 01:06:37,824
Has Angelina arrived safely?

1099
01:06:38,157 --> 01:06:39,242
Sir, she is fine.
- Good.

1100
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:40,743
Everything is under control.

1101
01:06:41,285 --> 01:06:42,453
She is in the 4th floor.
- Fourth, is it?

1102
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,288
Yeah.
With armed guards.

1103
01:06:44,497 --> 01:06:46,582
I hope there is no one else there.
- No one is there.

1104
01:06:46,749 --> 01:06:48,167
Everyone else has been asked to vacate.
- Be careful.

1105
01:06:48,334 --> 01:06:49,293
Yes, sir.

1106
01:06:52,714 --> 01:06:54,382
What's happening?
Leave me!

1107
01:07:21,075 --> 01:07:23,077
Anyway.
Excuse me.

1108
01:07:26,205 --> 01:07:27,248
A call from India?

1109
01:07:28,374 --> 01:07:29,542
Hello.
- Hello.

1110
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,003
What the heck
is happening out there?

1111
01:07:32,503 --> 01:07:34,339
Are you trying to kill me
and takeover my.. - Please, ma'am.

1112
01:07:34,505 --> 01:07:37,216
There's been a mistake. I've done
nothing wrong. - You got to trust me.

1113
01:07:37,383 --> 01:07:40,553
Once my foot steps on Swiss soil,
you are finished.

1114
01:07:42,013 --> 01:07:43,348
Wait, ma'am!

1115
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:45,725
Darn!

1116
01:07:46,184 --> 01:07:48,770
You said she'll be dead by now
but she just fired my..

1117
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:50,480
It's already 10 o'clock!

1118
01:07:50,646 --> 01:07:52,398
She should have been dead
at 9:30.

1119
01:07:53,941 --> 01:07:55,068
My career is finished!

1120
01:07:55,651 --> 01:07:57,320
I'm done.
- Andy!

1121
01:07:57,904 --> 01:07:58,863
You got to calm down.

1122
01:07:59,739 --> 01:08:00,865
I can take care of this.

1123
01:08:01,657 --> 01:08:02,700
Just give me five minutes.

1124
01:08:02,909 --> 01:08:04,452
Why don't you go inside and..
- Five minutes!

1125
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:05,828
Yeah, I heard you.
- Five minutes.

1126
01:08:05,995 --> 01:08:07,580
I'll join you in five minutes.

1127
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:09,123
Shit!

1128
01:08:13,127 --> 01:08:14,045
Dad.

1129
01:08:14,379 --> 01:08:15,380
What's happening?

1130
01:08:15,963 --> 01:08:17,423
Why isn't anyone
answering my calls?

1131
01:08:17,632 --> 01:08:19,801
All three of them got arrested.

1132
01:08:20,093 --> 01:08:21,469
Didn't you get the news?

1133
01:08:21,594 --> 01:08:22,595
What are you saying?

1134
01:08:23,388 --> 01:08:24,972
Won't you keep me updated
unless I ask you to?

1135
01:08:25,139 --> 01:08:26,265
I'm sorry, dear.

1136
01:08:26,391 --> 01:08:27,975
They have to be
in Mauritius at any cost.

1137
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:29,686
How will I seal the deal
without the money?

1138
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:31,062
Are you running out of money?

1139
01:08:31,396 --> 01:08:33,481
Tell me how much you need and to which account
I should transfer it to.

1140
01:08:33,606 --> 01:08:35,024
You bail them out!

1141
01:08:35,566 --> 01:08:37,527
Okay, it'll be done.
You'll get the good news.

1142
01:08:38,861 --> 01:08:40,780
Someone, please shut this box!

1143
01:08:49,747 --> 01:08:51,416
Hello.
- Sidharth Abhimanyu.

1144
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,251
Tell me.
- Vicky.

1145
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,921
You have to complete the job
I'd given your brother Perumal Swamy.

1146
01:09:00,258 --> 01:09:02,260
You haven't given me a job

1147
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,053
but an opportunity.

1148
01:09:04,595 --> 01:09:05,722
I'll take care of it.

1149
01:09:06,139 --> 01:09:08,766
Mithran's team
is in control of that area.

1150
01:09:09,434 --> 01:09:12,186
There is no information
on the whereabouts of the foreigner lady!

1151
01:09:20,778 --> 01:09:21,946
Take right.

1152
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:28,786
You don't be here. Head to the station
and come when I call you.

1153
01:09:55,646 --> 01:09:56,939
Mr. Mishra..

1154
01:09:57,148 --> 01:09:58,107
How are you?

1155
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:00,485
I'm fine, Sidharth. How are you?
What's up?

1156
01:10:00,651 --> 01:10:03,404
I urgently need 13 billion.

1157
01:10:03,571 --> 01:10:05,907
13 billion?
Are you kidding me?

1158
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:07,533
You are asking for it so casually.
- Well..

1159
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,869
Transfer it from your Liechtenstein account
to my Geneva account.

1160
01:10:10,036 --> 01:10:12,121
What?
- I've emailed you my bank details.

1161
01:10:12,372 --> 01:10:14,916
Why should I give you the money?
- You know who I am, right?

1162
01:10:15,124 --> 01:10:16,876
I've also attached a file
in that email.

1163
01:10:17,043 --> 01:10:19,253
Take a look at it
and then, decide.

1164
01:10:21,506 --> 01:10:22,715
<i>Hi, Ananya.</i>

1165
01:10:28,346 --> 01:10:29,722
<i>Miss India..</i>

1166
01:10:30,306 --> 01:10:33,393
Don't worry, I'll ensure that you get
a good profit in your next deal.

1167
01:10:33,893 --> 01:10:35,895
Fine.
I'll transfer the money.

1168
01:10:39,732 --> 01:10:43,986
<i>We welcome our honorable chief minister
to attend the meet for generic medicine</i>

1169
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:46,656
<i>with Pixim Company.
</i>- Sir. - Sir.

1170
01:10:46,823 --> 01:10:48,825
The function will start in about 20 minutes.

1171
01:10:49,534 --> 01:10:52,787
I've informed the chief minister's PA
that she will be here in 10 minutes.

1172
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:54,414
Fine.
I'll be upstairs.

1173
01:10:54,664 --> 01:10:55,998
I'll get her myself.

1174
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:08,469
Sir.

1175
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:10,972
You have her mobile, right?
- Yes, sir, it's with me.

1176
01:11:11,264 --> 01:11:12,682
But she made a call
from my mobile.

1177
01:11:12,849 --> 01:11:14,851
Why did you allow that?
She can be traced!

1178
01:11:15,143 --> 01:11:16,102
I'm sorry, sir!

1179
01:11:25,069 --> 01:11:26,362
Do come in.

1180
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:29,407
I can't believe what is happening!

1181
01:11:29,949 --> 01:11:31,951
Thank you for alerting me.
- It's my duty, ma'am.

1182
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:34,912
You shouldn't have called him
before the conference got over!

1183
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:39,250
I know but my own people
are trying to kill me!

1184
01:11:41,252 --> 01:11:42,670
What is the matter, Karna?

1185
01:11:42,837 --> 01:11:45,923
Sir, Mr. Mithran asked me
to get these files.

1186
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:47,133
Okay, come.

1187
01:11:47,759 --> 01:11:48,760
Here it is, sir.

1188
01:11:57,852 --> 01:11:58,770
What is it?

1189
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:02,315
Hey, stop it!

1190
01:12:06,152 --> 01:12:07,820
Please, don't shoot.

1191
01:12:11,032 --> 01:12:12,033
No!

1192
01:12:13,451 --> 01:12:14,577
Hey!

1193
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,884
Sir.

1194
01:12:31,344 --> 01:12:32,929
Karunakaran, is everything
taken care of?

1195
01:12:33,137 --> 01:12:34,389
Sir, I executed the plan
as per your instructions.

1196
01:12:34,597 --> 01:12:35,723
Good job!

1197
01:12:38,434 --> 01:12:39,811
Thank you for the money, sir.

1198
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:48,861
Yeah, Vicky?

1199
01:12:49,028 --> 01:12:50,279
Angelina is taken care of.

1200
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:52,281
The ASP who came to stop it
is also dead.

1201
01:12:52,532 --> 01:12:54,659
Excellent!
That's not enough.

1202
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:57,328
We'll have to finish everyone
who was involved in this!

1203
01:12:57,537 --> 01:12:58,538
Not many.

1204
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:01,207
The arrest warrant requested
for those three

1205
01:13:01,416 --> 01:13:02,625
and safeguarding Angelina..

1206
01:13:03,209 --> 01:13:05,169
All of it was taken care
by a single person.

1207
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:06,462
ASP Mithran.

1208
01:13:06,963 --> 01:13:08,381
All alone?
- Yes!

1209
01:13:10,925 --> 01:13:16,806
"Evilness will prevail,
if you think about me."

1210
01:13:16,973 --> 01:13:22,812
"Evilness will prevail,
no matter who tries to stop."

1211
01:13:22,979 --> 01:13:25,106
"Better think, better go."

1212
01:13:37,493 --> 01:13:39,579
<i>Considering the good will
of Tamilians</i>

1213
01:13:40,329 --> 01:13:47,295
<i>Ms. Angelina, who had come to sign
the generic medicine agreement</i>

1214
01:13:47,795 --> 01:13:50,131
<i>was killed and I deeply regret it.</i>

1215
01:13:50,423 --> 01:13:51,507
<i>It's unfortunate.</i>

1216
01:13:52,133 --> 01:13:54,719
<i>The investigation is on.</i>

1217
01:14:03,853 --> 01:14:05,688
From now on, whatever you do

1218
01:14:06,189 --> 01:14:07,231
be very careful.

1219
01:14:07,398 --> 01:14:09,025
Your life is at risk.

1220
01:14:10,026 --> 01:14:12,653
I never feared death, not even
when I didn't know what it was.

1221
01:14:13,863 --> 01:14:15,782
Now that I've
almost experienced it

1222
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:17,450
why should I fear?

1223
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:26,876
Good evening, sir.
Let me take that.

1224
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,169
Go home.

1225
01:14:28,461 --> 01:14:29,379
Give me the key.

1226
01:14:31,297 --> 01:14:32,507
<i>Why did he send
the driver away?</i>

1227
01:14:32,799 --> 01:14:34,550
<i>I have no clue
where he is going to drop me.</i>

1228
01:14:35,093 --> 01:14:38,304
<i>I wonder
why he preponed his trip.</i>

1229
01:14:39,263 --> 01:14:41,849
I've bailed out both of them
including Ashok.

1230
01:14:42,141 --> 01:14:45,019
I made sure that no LLR
was filed against them.

1231
01:14:45,269 --> 01:14:46,729
FIR.
- Whatever.

1232
01:14:49,941 --> 01:14:52,235
Why are you staring at me?
I asked you before doing it.

1233
01:14:53,027 --> 01:14:54,112
Just because I tell you to ask me
before doing anything

1234
01:14:54,278 --> 01:14:55,863
won't you do anything
on your own?

1235
01:14:56,197 --> 01:14:58,908
Instead of making mistakes
by taking decisions on my own

1236
01:14:59,117 --> 01:15:01,536
I feel satisfied when I make mistakes
after following your instruction.

1237
01:15:01,703 --> 01:15:03,329
That's what you have
taught your father.

1238
01:15:04,038 --> 01:15:08,084
I remember, when you were young,
you had taught me three golden rules.

1239
01:15:08,376 --> 01:15:12,505
First: Wherever you go,
raise your head and walk boldly.

1240
01:15:12,797 --> 01:15:16,759
Second: Even if there is a need to smile,
never show your teeth.

1241
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:21,264
Third: Unless I tell you, never take
your own decision and speak.

1242
01:15:21,431 --> 01:15:23,516
Only then the world
will praise you.

1243
01:15:23,683 --> 01:15:27,812
You taught me that most of the wise men
in Tamil Nadu follow these rules.

1244
01:15:28,021 --> 01:15:29,939
That is what I have been
following all these days.

1245
01:15:30,106 --> 01:15:32,108
Now, if you ask me to change
all of a sudden, how is it possible?

1246
01:15:32,358 --> 01:15:34,318
Does that mean,
you don't have common sense?

1247
01:15:35,361 --> 01:15:36,821
When did I say I have it?

1248
01:15:38,114 --> 01:15:39,115
Dad.

1249
01:15:39,532 --> 01:15:41,492
Even a sparrow has bigger brains.

1250
01:15:47,331 --> 01:15:48,708
Wear that around your neck.

1251
01:15:55,798 --> 01:15:58,718
The cops who used to salute
and open the car doors for us..

1252
01:15:59,302 --> 01:16:01,095
I feel so disgusted
when I think about it.

1253
01:16:01,846 --> 01:16:05,725
Thanks to your father's brains.
He bailed us out.

1254
01:16:09,187 --> 01:16:10,229
Who is he?

1255
01:16:10,438 --> 01:16:11,647
I was so angry
that I could have

1256
01:16:11,856 --> 01:16:13,066
killed him right there
in the hospital.

1257
01:16:13,358 --> 01:16:14,359
You forbade me from doing so.

1258
01:16:14,525 --> 01:16:15,568
Permit us to do so now.

1259
01:16:20,156 --> 01:16:24,452
Until yesterday, even Perumal's brother
was unaware that you guys are my proxies.

1260
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:26,120
But he knows it.

1261
01:16:27,163 --> 01:16:29,832
The three of you had no idea
as to why I had gone to Switzerland.

1262
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:31,125
But he knew it.

1263
01:16:31,584 --> 01:16:34,504
For the first time, somebody has tried
to play tricks on me.

1264
01:16:35,922 --> 01:16:37,924
This isn't an illegal affair
for you to perform honor killing.

1265
01:16:39,175 --> 01:16:40,218
Sir.

1266
01:16:41,552 --> 01:16:43,096
I have found
everything about him.

1267
01:16:43,846 --> 01:16:45,973
His name is Mithran.
His parents are no more.

1268
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,393
He is a loner.
He became a cop at his own will.

1269
01:16:48,976 --> 01:16:51,854
There is one place where he spends
more time than the police station.

1270
01:16:56,401 --> 01:16:57,735
<i>Define your enemy.</i>

1271
01:16:58,528 --> 01:16:59,612
<i>And I will define you.</i>

1272
01:17:27,098 --> 01:17:28,266
<i>Even I have an idea.</i>

1273
01:17:28,808 --> 01:17:29,934
<i>Just like you said</i>

1274
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:31,811
<i>I will make it my life
and be successful.</i>

1275
01:17:31,978 --> 01:17:32,895
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1276
01:17:44,907 --> 01:17:47,744
<i>Until now, a lot of people
have caused obstacles in my business.</i>

1277
01:17:48,911 --> 01:17:52,957
<i>I have killed all of them brutally.</i>

1278
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:55,126
<i>But he seems to be different.</i>

1279
01:17:56,002 --> 01:17:58,004
<i>He is waiting to destroy me.</i>

1280
01:17:59,172 --> 01:18:00,214
<i>He knows where I was born</i>

1281
01:18:00,381 --> 01:18:02,216
<i>where I was raised
what I specialized in</i>

1282
01:18:02,383 --> 01:18:03,343
<i>what my business is all about..</i>

1283
01:18:03,968 --> 01:18:07,472
<i>He has analyzed my past,
present and future plans.</i>

1284
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:17,190
He has preserved even this.

1285
01:18:17,357 --> 01:18:19,275
<i>Why has he preserved this?</i>

1286
01:18:19,817 --> 01:18:20,735
Shocking.

1287
01:18:21,652 --> 01:18:23,946
And surprising.
- <i>My son is feeling really bad.</i>

1288
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,490
I want to know about him.

1289
01:18:25,907 --> 01:18:27,533
Tell me about him.

1290
01:18:27,784 --> 01:18:29,535
I will send the counsel
of that area to his house

1291
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,746
and ask him to disconnect
all the basic provisions.

1292
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:38,002
I'll seize his ration card
and Aadhar card.

1293
01:18:40,505 --> 01:18:41,464
I will use my power

1294
01:18:41,673 --> 01:18:44,926
to seize his passport and make sure
that he doesn't even travel to Delhi.

1295
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:48,930
How is my idea?

1296
01:18:49,097 --> 01:18:50,139
Imbecile.

1297
01:18:53,976 --> 01:18:55,561
A small piece of the bullet

1298
01:18:55,895 --> 01:18:56,979
is still stuck inside.

1299
01:18:57,772 --> 01:18:59,065
It is better to remove it.

1300
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:03,236
Is it necessary
to get another surgery done?

1301
01:19:03,403 --> 01:19:05,071
Of course.
It is essential.

1302
01:19:05,238 --> 01:19:08,324
No way, Doctor. I thought, I would be
discharged this evening.

1303
01:19:08,574 --> 01:19:09,575
This is too late.

1304
01:19:09,784 --> 01:19:11,077
I have to go.
Please understand.

1305
01:19:11,244 --> 01:19:12,829
It is a minor surgery, Mr. Mithran.

1306
01:19:13,246 --> 01:19:14,956
I will discharge you
tomorrow evening.

1307
01:19:53,077 --> 01:19:54,704
Hey! What happened?
- Sidharth.

1308
01:19:55,997 --> 01:19:57,874
What are you saying?
- Sidharth was here.

1309
01:19:58,041 --> 01:19:59,167
Don't joke around. It must be
the sedative. Please lie down.

1310
01:19:59,334 --> 01:20:01,627
I saw him! - Lie down.
- Mithran.. - What are you saying?

1311
01:20:01,836 --> 01:20:03,087
Please listen to us.
Mithran.

1312
01:20:03,463 --> 01:20:04,505
Wait.

1313
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,924
Mithran.
- Mithran.

1314
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:09,010
Please listen.
- What are you doing?

1315
01:20:09,177 --> 01:20:13,306
I saw him. - Come.
- Sir.. - Sir..

1316
01:20:13,514 --> 01:20:15,516
Sir, what are you doing?
You are on sedatives.

1317
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:17,894
You shouldn't strain yourself.
- No, Doctor. - Come and lie down.

1318
01:20:23,441 --> 01:20:24,692
I saw him.

1319
01:20:24,901 --> 01:20:26,444
He was standing here.
- Don't blabber.

1320
01:20:38,206 --> 01:20:40,333
We are telling you, nobody came.
- I am not lying..

1321
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,751
Don't keep saying the same thing.
- No.

1322
01:20:41,959 --> 01:20:44,212
I am very clear.
I saw him here.

1323
01:20:45,004 --> 01:20:45,963
He was staring at me.

1324
01:20:46,172 --> 01:20:48,383
<i>Dr. Ramachandran,
this is a GPS tracking device.</i>

1325
01:20:48,633 --> 01:20:51,886
<i>The moment you implant this,
we can monitor the subject 24/7.</i>

1326
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:54,847
<i>Also, we can get the audio feed live
through satellite.</i>

1327
01:20:55,056 --> 01:20:56,099
<i>Here.</i>

1328
01:21:03,231 --> 01:21:09,779
Now, I will get to know of his whereabouts,
his plans and everything else in detail.

1329
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,742
You were the one who said
that he is not in India.

1330
01:21:14,951 --> 01:21:16,619
Then how do you think
he could have come here?

1331
01:21:16,786 --> 01:21:19,455
Even if he had come, do you think he would've
left without harming you?

1332
01:21:19,664 --> 01:21:21,165
Despite knowing everything about him

1333
01:21:21,499 --> 01:21:24,002
I have spared him alive
without shooting him dead, right?

1334
01:21:24,669 --> 01:21:25,795
Similarly

1335
01:21:26,629 --> 01:21:28,214
even he must have had a reason

1336
01:21:29,298 --> 01:21:30,425
to let go of me.

1337
01:21:32,176 --> 01:21:33,177
There must be a reason.

1338
01:21:34,721 --> 01:21:36,597
My car will arrive now, Mahima.
- You please sit down.

1339
01:21:36,764 --> 01:21:37,974
I am there, right?

1340
01:21:42,186 --> 01:21:43,896
Suraj called up
from Tirunelveli.

1341
01:21:44,188 --> 01:21:46,482
He felt bad that he couldn't
come to meet you in person.

1342
01:21:47,108 --> 01:21:48,234
I read his message.

1343
01:21:48,943 --> 01:21:51,154
Mahima, thank you for everything.

1344
01:21:51,362 --> 01:21:53,448
Go ahead.
You can thank me all you want.

1345
01:21:53,614 --> 01:21:54,699
It's only between lovers that there's
no 'thanks' and 'sorry'.

1346
01:21:54,866 --> 01:21:57,660
Hi, darling. - But I am not your lover,
so, you can say all you want.

1347
01:21:57,827 --> 01:21:58,745
I will accept it.

1348
01:21:58,911 --> 01:21:59,912
Your dad is here.

1349
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:02,081
He is waiting upstairs. Let's go?
- I will be there.

1350
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:06,169
What happened?
Does it hurt?

1351
01:22:06,586 --> 01:22:07,670
I feel so uneasy.

1352
01:22:08,171 --> 01:22:09,297
The doctor has said

1353
01:22:09,464 --> 01:22:11,841
that only if you have another dose
will you get any relief.

1354
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:13,092
Okay. I will take it.
<i>- In the area..</i>

1355
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:15,345
The next dose is after lunch.

1356
01:22:16,137 --> 01:22:17,597
I will go home
and be back by then.

1357
01:22:17,972 --> 01:22:19,349
No.
You don't have to come.

1358
01:22:19,515 --> 01:22:20,475
What do you mean?

1359
01:22:21,309 --> 01:22:22,518
Why are you removing that?

1360
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:24,270
I have to go out.

1361
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:26,272
Out?
Have you gone mad?

1362
01:22:26,564 --> 01:22:27,690
Where are you going?

1363
01:22:28,232 --> 01:22:29,233
I have an important work
to complete.

1364
01:22:29,692 --> 01:22:31,944
Please leave. I will call you
after I complete the work.

1365
01:22:32,111 --> 01:22:34,405
Don't have your way always.

1366
01:22:34,572 --> 01:22:35,990
What important work
do you have?

1367
01:22:38,701 --> 01:22:40,244
When I met Angelina

1368
01:22:41,245 --> 01:22:42,955
a guy had come there
to meet her.

1369
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:47,210
When I was in the hospital

1370
01:22:48,419 --> 01:22:49,587
he tried to meet me as well.

1371
01:22:49,754 --> 01:22:50,713
His name is Kumar.

1372
01:22:51,255 --> 01:22:52,924
Last week, near the IT Park

1373
01:22:53,132 --> 01:22:55,218
a girl was molested and murdered
by a few guys from Bihar.

1374
01:22:55,843 --> 01:22:57,345
Manimekalai..
He is her boyfriend.

1375
01:23:00,348 --> 01:23:01,349
Manimekalai?

1376
01:23:03,351 --> 01:23:04,268
<i>Manimekalai.</i>

1377
01:23:04,435 --> 01:23:08,981
<i>Just before her death, she had sent me
an important video evidence.</i>

1378
01:23:09,565 --> 01:23:10,733
<i>She was a scientist.</i>

1379
01:23:11,275 --> 01:23:12,360
<i>She was Sidharth's..</i>

1380
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:15,154
<i>Various atrocities have been
exposed in that video.</i>

1381
01:23:15,613 --> 01:23:17,323
<i>I need to handover
that SD card to you.</i>

1382
01:23:17,532 --> 01:23:19,492
<i>Sir..
She kept saying..</i>

1383
01:23:19,826 --> 01:23:20,785
<i>I have to research.</i>

1384
01:23:20,952 --> 01:23:23,621
<i>She was determined
to find the medicine.</i>

1385
01:23:24,163 --> 01:23:26,290
<i>She used to talk to me
about it all the time.</i>

1386
01:23:26,457 --> 01:23:27,709
<i>A girl like her</i>

1387
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:29,711
<i>was brutally molested
and murdered.</i>

1388
01:23:29,877 --> 01:23:31,212
<i>They should be punished.</i>

1389
01:23:31,379 --> 01:23:32,880
<i>I have no clue
as to whom to trust.</i>

1390
01:23:33,047 --> 01:23:34,549
<i>I am afraid of everything
that I see around.</i>

1391
01:23:34,716 --> 01:23:36,175
<i>Definitely, I will meet you.</i>

1392
01:23:36,342 --> 01:23:37,552
<i>I will get discharged tomorrow.</i>

1393
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:39,762
<i>As soon as I get discharged,
I will meet you. - Okay.</i>

1394
01:23:40,013 --> 01:23:41,681
<i>Until then, please don't
disclose this to anyone.</i>

1395
01:23:41,848 --> 01:23:42,974
<i>Okay, sir.
- Just one day.</i>

1396
01:23:44,517 --> 01:23:46,769
I am going to meet Kumar
at the entrance of his college.

1397
01:23:49,063 --> 01:23:50,732
Once I get the SD card

1398
01:23:52,525 --> 01:23:54,235
I will ruin Sidharth.

1399
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:57,655
<i>The world thinks you
to be a good person.</i>

1400
01:23:58,114 --> 01:23:59,115
<i>Sir..
Please, sir.</i>

1401
01:23:59,323 --> 01:24:00,908
<i>If they get to know that it is
a discovery of our country</i>

1402
01:24:01,075 --> 01:24:03,995
<i>all the medical industries across
the globe will bow before us.</i>

1403
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:06,164
<i>You think they should
bow before us.</i>

1404
01:24:06,497 --> 01:24:08,333
<i>But I think, they should
bow only before me.</i>

1405
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:11,127
<i>That's the only difference.
- Don't you think this is wrong?</i>

1406
01:24:11,294 --> 01:24:12,378
<i>Desire for something.</i>

1407
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,213
<i>Nothing will seem to be wrong.</i>

1408
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,798
<i>I will not let this happen.</i>

1409
01:24:17,342 --> 01:24:18,926
<i>I have a bad habit.</i>

1410
01:24:20,595 --> 01:24:21,763
<i>Let this remain a secret</i>

1411
01:24:22,305 --> 01:24:23,473
<i>and I will let you live.</i>

1412
01:24:24,807 --> 01:24:25,892
<i>I cannot say such things.</i>

1413
01:24:26,809 --> 01:24:27,894
<i>This is unfair, sir.</i>

1414
01:24:28,394 --> 01:24:29,812
<i>Even if you kill me</i>

1415
01:24:30,021 --> 01:24:32,899
<i>I will make sure that I expose you
before everyone!</i>

1416
01:24:37,528 --> 01:24:39,447
I placed the bug
to know more about him.

1417
01:24:41,449 --> 01:24:42,909
But I am getting to know
about myself.

1418
01:24:45,953 --> 01:24:47,914
I had thought that
the Manimekalai incident was over.

1419
01:24:49,957 --> 01:24:51,584
But she has a boyfriend.

1420
01:24:52,669 --> 01:24:54,128
I failed to notice it.

1421
01:24:54,879 --> 01:24:56,047
I have made a mistake.

1422
01:24:56,214 --> 01:24:57,632
Sidharth..
- He is not my enemy.

1423
01:24:58,091 --> 01:25:00,885
He is just a non-salaried servant
who finds out and informs me

1424
01:25:01,552 --> 01:25:03,805
about whatever
is happening against me.

1425
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:05,598
That is all.

1426
01:25:07,433 --> 01:25:08,351
Let me deal with it.

1427
01:25:09,102 --> 01:25:10,061
Oh, God!

1428
01:25:10,853 --> 01:25:11,771
I will deal with it.

1429
01:25:12,063 --> 01:25:13,064
Sure.

1430
01:25:14,565 --> 01:25:15,942
Shall I go and eat now?

1431
01:25:17,443 --> 01:25:18,528
I am hungry.

1432
01:25:27,453 --> 01:25:31,499
<i>The number you're calling
is currently out of range.</i>

1433
01:25:39,966 --> 01:25:41,175
Open your mouth and answer.

1434
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:43,094
Where is the SD card?

1435
01:25:43,761 --> 01:25:44,762
Tell me.

1436
01:25:46,597 --> 01:25:48,850
Don't make me kill you.
Tell me.

1437
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:53,771
Where have you
hidden the SD card?

1438
01:25:54,647 --> 01:25:55,606
Tell me.

1439
01:25:59,027 --> 01:26:00,778
Another thing.
- What else went missing?

1440
01:26:00,987 --> 01:26:02,488
Dude.
How are you?

1441
01:26:02,697 --> 01:26:04,490
Jana.
You are at Kanchipuram, right?

1442
01:26:04,657 --> 01:26:05,867
Are you busy right now?

1443
01:26:06,034 --> 01:26:07,994
Not really.
I was dealing with a theft case.

1444
01:26:08,161 --> 01:26:09,203
Not a problem.
Tell me.

1445
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:10,371
Okay.
Listen.

1446
01:26:10,663 --> 01:26:12,415
Kumar.
25, medium built.

1447
01:26:12,582 --> 01:26:13,666
He has got an SD card.

1448
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:16,210
It is an important evidence
against Sidharth.

1449
01:26:16,377 --> 01:26:17,712
He has told me that he will
hand it over to me.

1450
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,090
We had planned to meet exactly
30 kms ahead of Kanchipuram.

1451
01:26:21,257 --> 01:26:23,217
I have been calling him,
but no response.

1452
01:26:23,384 --> 01:26:24,635
I suspect some foul play.

1453
01:26:24,844 --> 01:26:26,179
I cannot leave this spot.

1454
01:26:26,346 --> 01:26:27,638
What if he comes?

1455
01:26:28,222 --> 01:26:31,184
Can you do me a favor?
172/16 Thiruvallur Street.

1456
01:26:31,559 --> 01:26:32,477
This is his address.

1457
01:26:32,643 --> 01:26:34,103
Go there by yourself.
Don't trust anyone.

1458
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:35,730
Thiruvallur Street, right?
It's nearby.

1459
01:26:35,897 --> 01:26:37,398
I will go and check.
- Thanks, pal.

1460
01:26:38,232 --> 01:26:39,233
Call Vicky.

1461
01:26:41,402 --> 01:26:44,030
Sir. - A police officer named
Jana is coming there.

1462
01:26:44,489 --> 01:26:45,782
He shouldn't get hold
of the card.

1463
01:26:45,948 --> 01:26:47,825
Got it.
A police officer is on his way it seems.

1464
01:26:47,992 --> 01:26:49,243
Search for it quickly.

1465
01:26:52,288 --> 01:26:53,414
I have been asking you for so long..

1466
01:27:01,172 --> 01:27:03,091
Hey, come here..
Raghava.

1467
01:27:03,257 --> 01:27:04,717
Looks like the police officer
is here.

1468
01:27:07,136 --> 01:27:08,137
Go..

1469
01:27:19,148 --> 01:27:20,358
Kumar..

1470
01:27:23,986 --> 01:27:25,154
Kumar.

1471
01:27:26,656 --> 01:27:27,740
Kumar.

1472
01:27:48,886 --> 01:27:49,971
Leave him.

1473
01:27:50,179 --> 01:27:51,139
Leave him.

1474
01:28:11,868 --> 01:28:12,994
Sir..

1475
01:28:15,371 --> 01:28:17,081
Please give it to Mr. Mithran.

1476
01:28:26,632 --> 01:28:28,509
I will kill him.
- No.

1477
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:30,094
You might be a cop..
- No!

1478
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:31,346
But don't you think
that I am a fool.

1479
01:28:31,512 --> 01:28:33,723
Give me that SD card.
I'll give it.

1480
01:28:34,057 --> 01:28:35,099
Give it to me or else..
- I will give it.

1481
01:28:35,266 --> 01:28:36,309
Please don't give it
to him, sir.

1482
01:28:36,476 --> 01:28:38,770
Shut up!
- I'll give it. Leave him.

1483
01:28:38,936 --> 01:28:41,647
This is Manimekalai's last wish.
- I'll kill him.

1484
01:28:41,814 --> 01:28:43,691
Even if he kills me, it is fine.

1485
01:28:44,484 --> 01:28:45,485
I am going to kill him.

1486
01:28:45,651 --> 01:28:46,569
Just leave him.

1487
01:28:46,736 --> 01:28:47,737
I am giving it to you.
- No, sir.

1488
01:28:47,904 --> 01:28:49,697
Give the card. - Please don't give it.
- I am giving it.

1489
01:28:49,989 --> 01:28:53,242
Please don't give it to him, sir.
- I'm giving it. - Come on!

1490
01:28:53,409 --> 01:28:54,619
I trusted you, sir.
Please, sir.

1491
01:28:54,786 --> 01:28:55,912
Shut up.

1492
01:28:56,162 --> 01:28:57,121
Leave him.
- Please listen to me.

1493
01:28:57,288 --> 01:28:59,791
Give it to Mr. Mithran.
- Give it!

1494
01:28:59,999 --> 01:29:01,000
Here, take it.

1495
01:29:01,709 --> 01:29:02,960
Kumar!

1496
01:29:20,061 --> 01:29:21,646
Kumar.
- Open the door.

1497
01:29:22,647 --> 01:29:24,440
I will kill you if I come out.

1498
01:29:27,276 --> 01:29:28,611
Yeah, Vicky?
- Sorry.

1499
01:29:29,153 --> 01:29:30,822
The police officer
escaped with the card.

1500
01:29:30,988 --> 01:29:32,782
I will somehow find him.

1501
01:29:32,949 --> 01:29:33,950
Darn it!

1502
01:29:36,244 --> 01:29:37,578
What happened?
Why didn't you answer my call?

1503
01:29:37,745 --> 01:29:39,038
Vicky, hold on.

1504
01:29:39,247 --> 01:29:40,331
A lot happened.

1505
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:41,499
Kumar is dead.

1506
01:29:41,874 --> 01:29:43,209
But somehow,
I have got the SD card.

1507
01:29:43,376 --> 01:29:44,961
Where do I have to come?
- Don't you stop anywhere.

1508
01:29:45,128 --> 01:29:46,462
Come towards Chennai.

1509
01:29:46,629 --> 01:29:47,797
I will come
in the opposite direction.

1510
01:29:47,964 --> 01:29:50,800
Wherever I meet you, I will take
the SD card from you. - Okay.

1511
01:30:38,389 --> 01:30:39,515
Where is the card?

1512
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,522
Next week, this factory
is going to be mine.

1513
01:30:48,066 --> 01:30:50,234
The government had it
closed, calling it sick.

1514
01:30:50,777 --> 01:30:52,570
Because I made it so.

1515
01:30:52,987 --> 01:30:56,407
Had I caught you 2 kms before, I would
have churned you in my clinker factory.

1516
01:30:58,159 --> 01:30:59,911
Had I caught you 2 kms ahead

1517
01:31:00,495 --> 01:31:03,331
I would have admitted you
in my health institute

1518
01:31:03,498 --> 01:31:05,583
and would have cut you into pieces.

1519
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,002
This is just

1520
01:31:08,211 --> 01:31:12,507
0.000001 percent
of whatever I'm involved in.

1521
01:31:14,008 --> 01:31:16,511
In the last 20 years,
more than focusing on my career

1522
01:31:17,095 --> 01:31:20,223
I've concentrated on not leaving
any evidence after committing an evil deed.

1523
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,769
Then, what made Mithran
look for an evidence?

1524
01:31:26,854 --> 01:31:28,314
Mithran didn't have
to look for an evidence.

1525
01:31:28,481 --> 01:31:30,858
In fact, he is the reason
you did everything.

1526
01:31:31,067 --> 01:31:34,404
To vent his anger
on someone like you..

1527
01:31:34,821 --> 01:31:37,865
He was born as a boon
just for that purpose.

1528
01:31:39,784 --> 01:31:41,369
Don't value him so much.

1529
01:31:41,703 --> 01:31:45,039
I will make him lose everything
and kill him brutally.

1530
01:31:45,665 --> 01:31:46,624
No chance.

1531
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:48,668
Killing you

1532
01:31:48,918 --> 01:31:50,378
is his only emotion.

1533
01:31:51,087 --> 01:31:52,296
Apart from that

1534
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,966
he doesn't have any emotion.

1535
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,640
Sir, I checked
his bike as well.

1536
01:32:03,016 --> 01:32:04,058
I couldn't find
the SD card there as well.

1537
01:32:04,767 --> 01:32:05,727
Where have you kept it?

1538
01:32:07,061 --> 01:32:08,021
Tell me.

1539
01:32:13,151 --> 01:32:14,235
Are you trying to escape?

1540
01:32:14,861 --> 01:32:16,029
I will show you.

1541
01:32:20,366 --> 01:32:21,868
Where is the SD card?
- I am not going to say it.

1542
01:32:22,035 --> 01:32:23,369
I won't reveal it to you.

1543
01:32:34,756 --> 01:32:35,798
Where is the SD card?

1544
01:32:36,215 --> 01:32:37,633
Tell me.
- I won't!

1545
01:32:38,259 --> 01:32:41,137
Did you think we Malayalis
will easily frame our friends?

1546
01:32:41,304 --> 01:32:43,973
We'll sacrifice
our lives for our friends.

1547
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,767
He doesn't seem to cooperate.

1548
01:32:45,933 --> 01:32:46,851
Sidharth.

1549
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:48,728
You are finished.

1550
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:52,065
I will send a message from his phone
and make Mithran come here.

1551
01:32:53,107 --> 01:32:54,025
Okay.

1552
01:32:54,233 --> 01:32:55,985
He said he doesn't
have any emotion.

1553
01:32:56,903 --> 01:32:59,113
Make sure his death
brings out the emotions in him.

1554
01:33:11,834 --> 01:33:14,087
Jana!
- Mithran.

1555
01:33:16,422 --> 01:33:17,590
Jana!

1556
01:33:19,467 --> 01:33:20,426
Jana!

1557
01:33:22,345 --> 01:33:23,346
Jana!

1558
01:33:29,644 --> 01:33:30,978
Jana..

1559
01:33:31,562 --> 01:33:32,689
No.

1560
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:33,981
Let go of him.

1561
01:33:34,315 --> 01:33:35,858
Jana!
Jana!

1562
01:33:45,993 --> 01:33:47,120
Jana..

1563
01:34:05,179 --> 01:34:07,015
Look here.
- Jana.

1564
01:34:07,765 --> 01:34:08,891
I will throw him.

1565
01:34:10,518 --> 01:34:11,436
Come.

1566
01:34:12,729 --> 01:34:13,938
No, don't.

1567
01:34:14,355 --> 01:34:15,356
Shall I?

1568
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:17,650
Shall I?
I will.

1569
01:34:18,818 --> 01:34:20,153
Are you playing tricks on me?

1570
01:34:20,778 --> 01:34:21,988
Come.

1571
01:34:28,328 --> 01:34:29,662
Jana!

1572
01:34:51,976 --> 01:34:53,102
Don't you want to see him die?

1573
01:34:53,269 --> 01:34:54,437
Come out.

1574
01:35:18,378 --> 01:35:19,295
Your friend is coming.

1575
01:35:19,462 --> 01:35:20,755
Go.

1576
01:35:23,132 --> 01:35:26,344
Jana, don't come.

1577
01:35:27,762 --> 01:35:29,055
Jana!

1578
01:35:31,182 --> 01:35:32,975
Jana, don't come.

1579
01:35:33,518 --> 01:35:34,477
Jana.

1580
01:35:34,686 --> 01:35:35,770
Don't come.

1581
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,856
Listen to me.

1582
01:35:39,232 --> 01:35:40,733
Jana, don't come.

1583
01:35:41,234 --> 01:35:42,568
Jana, don't come.

1584
01:35:42,735 --> 01:35:44,028
Jana, don't come.

1585
01:35:44,195 --> 01:35:45,405
Jana, no!

1586
01:35:52,203 --> 01:35:53,287
Jana..

1587
01:35:55,123 --> 01:35:57,041
Jana!

1588
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:06,092
<i>Under the influence of drugs</i>

1589
01:36:06,592 --> 01:36:10,221
<i>a half-naked police officer
dies in a road accident.</i>

1590
01:36:12,515 --> 01:36:13,558
More than his death

1591
01:36:14,434 --> 01:36:16,060
it's this humiliation
that I'm unable to bear.

1592
01:36:17,603 --> 01:36:19,105
Did he deserve such a death?

1593
01:36:19,897 --> 01:36:20,898
After this

1594
01:36:21,274 --> 01:36:22,692
in every plan of Mithran's

1595
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,528
we will be contributing more.

1596
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:45,423
I'm solely responsible
for Jana's death.

1597
01:36:46,049 --> 01:36:47,342
I shouldn't have sent him there.

1598
01:36:47,925 --> 01:36:50,845
There is no way anyone
could have known about the SD card.

1599
01:36:51,763 --> 01:36:53,014
Then, how did this happen?

1600
01:36:54,182 --> 01:36:55,350
I'm clueless.

1601
01:36:56,768 --> 01:36:59,145
I have been doing
everything carefully.

1602
01:37:03,983 --> 01:37:06,819
Mahima. Did you change
the position of the pin in the photo?

1603
01:37:07,445 --> 01:37:09,614
Pin?
Why would I change?

1604
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,283
What happened?
Why are you asking that?

1605
01:37:16,496 --> 01:37:17,705
If you didn't change it..

1606
01:37:18,331 --> 01:37:20,083
Do you think somebody
would have come here?

1607
01:37:20,249 --> 01:37:21,793
What if Sidharth himself
was here?

1608
01:37:26,172 --> 01:37:27,215
Don't touch that, Mithran.

1609
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,841
You have a doubt, right?

1610
01:37:29,634 --> 01:37:30,718
I will clear it.

1611
01:37:30,927 --> 01:37:31,886
I am totally free now.

1612
01:37:34,722 --> 01:37:36,057
In deep thoughts?

1613
01:37:36,557 --> 01:37:37,475
Hold this pin.

1614
01:37:43,815 --> 01:37:44,899
Keep it there.

1615
01:37:47,193 --> 01:37:49,612
If we had
Sidharth's fingerprints

1616
01:37:49,779 --> 01:37:51,197
it would have been much easier.

1617
01:37:56,452 --> 01:37:57,453
Mahima.

1618
01:37:59,539 --> 01:38:01,541
Sidharth's fingerprints
are there on this gun case.

1619
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:03,626
Are you sure?
- He had presented it to me.

1620
01:38:04,377 --> 01:38:06,254
I never touched it.

1621
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:09,007
I was wearing gloves when I had
received it from him that day.

1622
01:38:28,067 --> 01:38:29,610
The fingerprints match.

1623
01:38:30,153 --> 01:38:31,320
Sidharth was here.

1624
01:38:44,584 --> 01:38:46,294
He has entered my home.

1625
01:38:48,296 --> 01:38:50,340
He is going to treat me
in a special way.

1626
01:38:51,049 --> 01:38:51,966
But..

1627
01:38:52,425 --> 01:38:54,218
Why would he have placed
the pin on this photo?

1628
01:39:00,099 --> 01:39:02,435
She is 2011 Miss India.

1629
01:39:02,602 --> 01:39:03,686
Ananya.

1630
01:39:07,231 --> 01:39:08,649
These are the photos
of the event.

1631
01:39:09,567 --> 01:39:10,610
Look at Ananya.

1632
01:39:12,945 --> 01:39:14,781
It's Shilpa in the third row.

1633
01:39:15,114 --> 01:39:16,657
Shilpa?
- Yeah.

1634
01:39:16,908 --> 01:39:18,034
She is Sidharth's girlfriend.

1635
01:39:18,201 --> 01:39:19,577
How is it?
- Nice.

1636
01:39:20,703 --> 01:39:21,996
The one who came first

1637
01:39:22,121 --> 01:39:23,831
was with him in Switzerland.

1638
01:39:24,666 --> 01:39:27,502
Shilpa is in a live-in relationship
with him now.

1639
01:39:28,211 --> 01:39:30,630
How is he connected to that event?

1640
01:39:31,756 --> 01:39:34,133
Check this link that says
'Conspiracy over the event'.

1641
01:39:34,467 --> 01:39:36,511
Shilpa had more supporters.

1642
01:39:38,596 --> 01:39:41,766
There are a lot of comments against Ananya
being crowned the Miss India.

1643
01:39:42,392 --> 01:39:46,562
<i>We can confidently declare Shilpa
as the winning candidate.</i>

1644
01:39:47,355 --> 01:39:50,274
<i>Not only that, she has the capability
to win the Miss World, too.</i>

1645
01:39:51,025 --> 01:39:54,153
<i>Nearly 20 leading companies
are ready to give the advance.</i>

1646
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,947
<i>If she wins</i>

1647
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:57,990
<i>we won't be able
to catch hold of her for a year.</i>

1648
01:39:58,157 --> 01:40:01,869
<i>That's why, I have decided to let her sign
the contract for our company in advance.</i>

1649
01:40:02,286 --> 01:40:03,329
<i>There's no need for any contract.</i>

1650
01:40:04,330 --> 01:40:05,498
<i>I have other plans.</i>

1651
01:40:07,625 --> 01:40:09,794
<i>She doesn't have to roam around
the world as Miss World.</i>

1652
01:40:10,003 --> 01:40:12,005
<i>She should consider me her world
and stay beside me always.</i>

1653
01:40:12,171 --> 01:40:14,966
<i>Before she leaves this place,
I should win her heart.</i>

1654
01:40:15,133 --> 01:40:17,760
<i>Look for some other
useful candidate.</i>

1655
01:40:18,011 --> 01:40:19,721
<i>Ananya might be useful.</i>

1656
01:40:19,887 --> 01:40:21,014
<i>Make her number one.
- Okay.</i>

1657
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:22,557
<i>The final round is about to start.</i>

1658
01:40:24,017 --> 01:40:26,102
<i>Shilpa is all set
to walk on the ramp.</i>

1659
01:40:26,519 --> 01:40:27,645
<i>Before that</i>

1660
01:40:28,146 --> 01:40:29,772
<i>ask them to tell her
that her dad passed away.</i>

1661
01:40:30,148 --> 01:40:31,774
<i>What?
Is he dead?</i>

1662
01:40:33,484 --> 01:40:34,402
<i>He will be dead.</i>

1663
01:40:34,652 --> 01:40:37,280
<i>In half an hour,
Perumal Swamy will murder her dad.</i>

1664
01:40:41,826 --> 01:40:44,162
<i>Shilpa doesn't have a flight
to leave for Chennai now.</i>

1665
01:40:44,662 --> 01:40:47,415
<i>Make arrangements for her
to come with me in my chartered flight.</i>

1666
01:40:49,459 --> 01:40:50,710
<i>I really miss him.</i>

1667
01:41:09,729 --> 01:41:10,730
<i>Kumar</i>

1668
01:41:10,897 --> 01:41:12,857
<i>25, medium built. He has got an SD card.
- Thiruvallur Street, right?</i>

1669
01:41:13,733 --> 01:41:15,401
<i>Kumar!
- Keep coming towards Chennai.</i>

1670
01:41:15,568 --> 01:41:16,611
<i>Jana!</i>

1671
01:41:41,803 --> 01:41:43,054
Sir, your breakfast.

1672
01:41:43,513 --> 01:41:44,681
Then..

1673
01:41:46,974 --> 01:41:47,892
Newspaper, right?

1674
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:49,060
Please keep it over there.

1675
01:43:49,889 --> 01:43:51,599
What is this?
What have you done?

1676
01:43:51,849 --> 01:43:53,434
Why are you bleeding?
- Leave me.

1677
01:43:54,686 --> 01:43:55,770
I'll get to know
only if you tell me.

1678
01:43:55,937 --> 01:43:57,021
Don't ask me anything.

1679
01:43:58,106 --> 01:43:59,023
Just go from here.

1680
01:44:00,525 --> 01:44:01,693
I don't wish to see anyone.

1681
01:44:02,318 --> 01:44:03,444
Leave me alone.

1682
01:44:04,779 --> 01:44:06,614
We are here to help you.

1683
01:44:06,781 --> 01:44:10,034
Without Sidharth's knowledge, I have
even fixed an appointment with Shilpa.

1684
01:44:10,201 --> 01:44:11,285
We are meeting at 4 o'clock.

1685
01:44:11,452 --> 01:44:12,620
We will definitely
get some clue.

1686
01:44:12,787 --> 01:44:13,788
And then?

1687
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:15,748
He will find out that as well.

1688
01:44:16,249 --> 01:44:17,250
What is the use?

1689
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:20,920
He is watching my every move.

1690
01:44:21,713 --> 01:44:24,048
He is taking away
everything from me.

1691
01:44:24,298 --> 01:44:25,383
Dear.

1692
01:44:26,509 --> 01:44:27,760
What is it?
- Read this out.

1693
01:44:30,304 --> 01:44:31,305
Excuse me.

1694
01:44:36,102 --> 01:44:37,311
He murdered Kumar.

1695
01:44:37,937 --> 01:44:38,938
Jana.

1696
01:44:39,188 --> 01:44:40,565
He took his life as well.

1697
01:44:41,232 --> 01:44:43,568
I've no idea as to what I'm doing.
He's making me feel that way!

1698
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:46,320
I can't believe
you are doing this.

1699
01:44:47,488 --> 01:44:49,449
Patience is what
I like the most in you.

1700
01:44:50,283 --> 01:44:51,659
You have lost that as well.

1701
01:44:52,785 --> 01:44:54,912
If you have patience,
you can even get what you lost.

1702
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:57,790
But if you lose patience

1703
01:44:58,041 --> 01:44:59,292
you will lose everything
that you have.

1704
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:01,002
What else is left to lose?

1705
01:45:01,919 --> 01:45:03,129
I have lost everything.

1706
01:45:04,088 --> 01:45:05,173
But I still have one thing.

1707
01:45:06,049 --> 01:45:07,091
My life.

1708
01:45:08,134 --> 01:45:10,011
I will kill him
even if it costs me my life.

1709
01:45:11,512 --> 01:45:12,722
This is your problem.

1710
01:45:14,432 --> 01:45:17,769
When you said that you choose
your enemy as per your standards

1711
01:45:18,353 --> 01:45:19,520
I felt so happy.

1712
01:45:20,646 --> 01:45:23,316
But that has become an obsession
and you are losing yourself.

1713
01:45:24,442 --> 01:45:27,070
Only if you value your life
can you value the life you lead.

1714
01:45:28,196 --> 01:45:32,033
Even I wish to marry you
and lead a life with you.

1715
01:45:32,367 --> 01:45:35,203
But it's not for me
that I want you to live.

1716
01:45:35,703 --> 01:45:38,456
I want you to live so that
you can achieve your goals.

1717
01:45:39,374 --> 01:45:42,377
You are proudly saying that you will
kill him even at the cost of your life.

1718
01:45:42,877 --> 01:45:44,504
Ask Sidharth to say
the same thing.

1719
01:45:44,671 --> 01:45:45,713
He will not say it.

1720
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:48,758
Because you are just
one of the thousand guys against him.

1721
01:45:49,008 --> 01:45:50,677
He is looking at you
only as a hindrance.

1722
01:45:50,885 --> 01:45:52,345
He will carry on undeterred.

1723
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:54,764
Only you think of him
as your destiny.

1724
01:45:55,473 --> 01:45:59,268
To you, bravery is killing him
at the cost of your life.

1725
01:45:59,977 --> 01:46:02,146
But you should kill him
without losing your life.

1726
01:46:02,313 --> 01:46:03,898
That is true bravery.

1727
01:46:04,774 --> 01:46:08,069
I don't know if you have understood
anything that I just said.

1728
01:46:08,236 --> 01:46:09,696
If you have understood, fine.

1729
01:46:09,862 --> 01:46:11,197
Or else, just do as you please.

1730
01:46:15,326 --> 01:46:17,078
<i>Patience is what
I like the most in you.</i>

1731
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:19,330
<i>You have lost that as well.</i>

1732
01:46:20,498 --> 01:46:23,001
<i>Only if you value your life
can you value the life you lead.</i>

1733
01:46:23,584 --> 01:46:27,171
<i>To you, bravery is killing him
at the cost of your life.</i>

1734
01:46:28,548 --> 01:46:30,591
<i>But you should kill him
without losing your life.</i>

1735
01:46:32,677 --> 01:46:36,389
<i>Even I wish to marry you
and lead a life with you.</i>

1736
01:46:37,015 --> 01:46:39,767
<i>But it's not for me
that I want you to live.</i>

1737
01:46:40,393 --> 01:46:42,937
<i>I want you to live so that
you can achieve your goals.</i>

1738
01:46:44,856 --> 01:46:48,026
<i>Without Sidharth's knowledge, I have
even fixed an appointment with Shilpa.</i>

1739
01:46:48,234 --> 01:46:49,444
<i>We are meeting at 4 o'clock.</i>

1740
01:46:54,407 --> 01:46:55,325
Hi, sweetheart.

1741
01:46:55,491 --> 01:46:57,577
Can we go out?
- Where?

1742
01:46:57,744 --> 01:46:59,287
I don't know..
Maybe for a drive.

1743
01:46:59,454 --> 01:47:01,372
What time?
- 4 o'clock?

1744
01:47:03,499 --> 01:47:04,625
4 o'clock, is it?

1745
01:47:04,959 --> 01:47:06,627
I have to go
to the beauty parlor.

1746
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:08,588
I will come home now.

1747
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:10,631
I will join you for lunch.

1748
01:47:11,174 --> 01:47:12,842
What do you say?
- Okay. Sure.

1749
01:47:13,009 --> 01:47:13,968
I will see you, darling.

1750
01:47:14,302 --> 01:47:15,511
Love you, sweetheart.

1751
01:47:15,678 --> 01:47:17,472
Love you too.
Bye.

1752
01:47:20,141 --> 01:47:21,934
I am going to kill Shilpa.

1753
01:47:23,436 --> 01:47:24,520
Shilpa?

1754
01:47:25,813 --> 01:47:26,939
Love at first sight.

1755
01:47:28,024 --> 01:47:29,359
Kill at first betrayal.

1756
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:31,903
That's what I believe in.

1757
01:47:33,529 --> 01:47:35,156
When I first met her

1758
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:36,866
my heart skipped a beat.

1759
01:47:38,993 --> 01:47:40,662
I planned and won her heart.

1760
01:47:42,246 --> 01:47:43,206
I think, I..

1761
01:47:43,706 --> 01:47:44,999
I think, I love her, Dad.

1762
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:48,169
But now..

1763
01:47:48,419 --> 01:47:49,504
She lied to me.

1764
01:47:51,214 --> 01:47:52,674
She is going
to meet Mahima.

1765
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:53,758
That is betrayal, isn't it?

1766
01:47:53,925 --> 01:47:55,176
<i>Order one cake..
</i>- But still..

1767
01:47:56,177 --> 01:47:57,845
Happy Chocolate Cake.
One Kg.

1768
01:47:58,096 --> 01:47:59,764
Cake?
- I can hear you.

1769
01:48:00,848 --> 01:48:01,808
Any occasion, sir?

1770
01:48:03,434 --> 01:48:05,019
But it is for someone special.

1771
01:48:08,272 --> 01:48:09,232
Hello.

1772
01:48:09,482 --> 01:48:10,733
Mahima.

1773
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:13,569
Tell me.
- Can you come home?

1774
01:48:14,946 --> 01:48:16,072
I cannot come home.

1775
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:17,782
Whatever it is,
tell it over the phone.

1776
01:48:18,324 --> 01:48:19,742
Can you come for me?

1777
01:48:20,451 --> 01:48:21,369
What is this?

1778
01:48:21,577 --> 01:48:22,954
There is a change in your tone.

1779
01:48:23,705 --> 01:48:25,331
Yes.
Come.

1780
01:48:26,457 --> 01:48:27,709
Okay.
I will come.

1781
01:48:29,794 --> 01:48:31,838
Mithran is going to propose
his love to Mahima.

1782
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:34,674
That's why,
he has called her home.

1783
01:48:34,882 --> 01:48:39,053
I will kill Mahima also the very next moment
Mithran proposes to her. - Son..

1784
01:48:40,138 --> 01:48:41,305
He should know the pain.

1785
01:48:41,889 --> 01:48:43,099
He has to know.

1786
01:48:43,266 --> 01:48:46,269
But for that..
- Only when I talk to you

1787
01:48:46,436 --> 01:48:47,770
I get a clarity.
- Clarity?

1788
01:48:48,896 --> 01:48:51,065
I am able to decide.
Thanks for your help.

1789
01:48:52,275 --> 01:48:55,111
I helped you to kill two people?
When did this happen?

1790
01:49:02,285 --> 01:49:03,619
Vicky, have you reached?

1791
01:49:03,786 --> 01:49:05,496
Two minutes. I will be in position.
- Okay.

1792
01:49:18,843 --> 01:49:20,470
Mahima's car is approaching.

1793
01:50:12,355 --> 01:50:13,815
<i>A small piece of the bullet</i>

1794
01:50:14,148 --> 01:50:15,400
<i>is stuck inside.</i>

1795
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:16,943
<i>Is another surgery necessary?</i>

1796
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:18,569
<i>It is a minor surgery, Mr. Mithran.</i>

1797
01:50:19,946 --> 01:50:21,447
<i>If you feel any pain</i>

1798
01:50:21,614 --> 01:50:22,573
<i>don't do anything.</i>

1799
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:24,242
<i>I will come and check it personally.</i>

1800
01:50:25,493 --> 01:50:27,495
Sir, she is stepping out of the car.

1801
01:50:27,662 --> 01:50:29,455
Keep watching.
I will let you know when to shoot.

1802
01:50:50,226 --> 01:50:51,602
Why did you call me?
Tell me.

1803
01:50:53,229 --> 01:50:54,230
Tell me.

1804
01:50:56,691 --> 01:50:58,901
I have a clear shot
of the target.

1805
01:50:59,777 --> 01:51:00,987
Hold.

1806
01:51:07,035 --> 01:51:08,036
Tell me.

1807
01:51:08,536 --> 01:51:09,829
<i>Can you come home?</i>

1808
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:11,456
<i>Can you come for me?</i>

1809
01:51:12,248 --> 01:51:13,249
Well..

1810
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:15,293
Mr. Prabhakar's kid..

1811
01:51:15,501 --> 01:51:16,878
It is his birthday.

1812
01:51:17,879 --> 01:51:18,963
He had invited us.

1813
01:51:19,088 --> 01:51:20,423
That's why, I called you.

1814
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:23,259
What are you saying?

1815
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:24,469
Did you call me for this?

1816
01:51:24,635 --> 01:51:25,595
Yes.

1817
01:51:27,263 --> 01:51:28,222
Shall I?

1818
01:51:28,765 --> 01:51:30,641
Hold on.
- Right.

1819
01:51:31,893 --> 01:51:33,478
You sounded different
over the phone.

1820
01:51:33,644 --> 01:51:36,230
You..
You left in anger, right?

1821
01:51:36,522 --> 01:51:39,025
Only if I speak like that will
you come, right? - Tell me the truth.

1822
01:51:39,192 --> 01:51:41,110
Did you call me for this?
- What else for?

1823
01:51:41,277 --> 01:51:42,654
Why are you asking me
the same thing?

1824
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:44,530
If you don't wish
to come, it is fine.

1825
01:51:44,697 --> 01:51:47,075
I thought you had called me
to propose to me.

1826
01:51:47,241 --> 01:51:48,576
Don't you have any sense?

1827
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,162
Don't you have anything else
to think other than love?

1828
01:51:51,329 --> 01:51:52,955
You somehow come back
to the same topic!

1829
01:51:53,122 --> 01:51:54,248
Listen now.

1830
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:56,542
I will never
fall in love with you.

1831
01:51:56,876 --> 01:51:57,877
Please leave me.

1832
01:52:02,256 --> 01:52:03,383
Why are you behaving like this?

1833
01:52:03,841 --> 01:52:06,511
Everytime, you cheat me
after giving me hopes.

1834
01:52:07,095 --> 01:52:09,180
You could have, rather, killed me.

1835
01:52:09,514 --> 01:52:11,349
This life is..
- Abort.

1836
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:13,226
What happened?

1837
01:52:13,476 --> 01:52:14,519
Do what I say.

1838
01:52:14,769 --> 01:52:16,521
Okay.
Lucky you.

1839
01:52:16,688 --> 01:52:18,398
Why are you killing me
bit by bit?

1840
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:22,485
<i>Sidharth can hear me.</i>

1841
01:52:34,664 --> 01:52:36,124
Can't you understand it
if I say once?

1842
01:52:36,457 --> 01:52:37,500
First, go from here!

1843
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:00,148
Hey.

1844
01:53:00,398 --> 01:53:01,607
Your lunch is ready.

1845
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:03,067
Cool.

1846
01:53:04,027 --> 01:53:05,111
How was your day?

1847
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:06,988
It's been alright.

1848
01:53:07,655 --> 01:53:09,657
A bit boring.
- Why so?

1849
01:53:10,325 --> 01:53:11,492
What happened?

1850
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:14,829
But I have a feeling
it's going to get better.

1851
01:53:19,542 --> 01:53:23,171
<i>I've fixed an appointment with Shilpa
without Sidharth's knowledge.</i>

1852
01:53:29,802 --> 01:53:30,887
Wait a minute!

1853
01:53:32,638 --> 01:53:35,266
<i>Keep hugging me and say
whatever you want to say!</i>

1854
01:53:39,979 --> 01:53:40,938
Look here.

1855
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:45,735
Stop disturbing me with silly stuffs
like your useless meeting with Shilpa.

1856
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:47,153
There is no use meeting her.

1857
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:48,363
Do you understand?

1858
01:53:49,614 --> 01:53:51,157
First, cancel the appointment with her.

1859
01:53:51,324 --> 01:53:53,493
Hereafter, mind your own business!
Go.

1860
01:53:57,830 --> 01:54:01,793
<i>I've informed the doctor, as you said.
He'll be here in half an hour.</i>

1861
01:54:01,959 --> 01:54:04,754
<i>Till then, what's the plan?</i>

1862
01:54:16,349 --> 01:54:21,938
"When love emerges in my heart.."

1863
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:27,694
"Why does my eyes fill with tears?"

1864
01:54:28,152 --> 01:54:33,700
"I planned to mesmerize you
with my eyes."

1865
01:54:33,992 --> 01:54:36,703
"Like the eyeliner
moistened with tears.."

1866
01:54:36,911 --> 01:54:39,706
"I craved to merge with you."

1867
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:41,958
"My heart goes crazy"

1868
01:54:42,417 --> 01:54:45,670
"when you look at me."

1869
01:54:46,004 --> 01:54:47,964
"A world of our own"

1870
01:54:48,297 --> 01:54:51,300
"where we live together."

1871
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:57,056
"The look in your eyes conveys
your love like a blazing fire."

1872
01:54:57,265 --> 01:55:02,645
"My heart has gone crazy
over the words you conveyed in silence."

1873
01:55:03,312 --> 01:55:08,484
"The look in your eyes conveys
your love like a blazing fire."

1874
01:55:09,068 --> 01:55:14,365
"My heart has gone crazy
over the words you conveyed in silence."

1875
01:55:26,627 --> 01:55:32,008
"You are the beautiful melody of love.
I am the song of your life."

1876
01:55:32,508 --> 01:55:37,555
"I will live forever in love,
even when everything leaves me."

1877
01:55:37,722 --> 01:55:40,391
"My heart never forgets"

1878
01:55:40,558 --> 01:55:43,186
"to be in constant
remembrance of you."

1879
01:55:43,353 --> 01:55:45,897
"Your heart never melts."

1880
01:55:46,272 --> 01:55:49,025
"I shed tears every time."

1881
01:55:49,233 --> 01:55:52,111
"I shed tears every time."

1882
01:55:52,278 --> 01:55:55,114
"Even now for our love."

1883
01:56:22,266 --> 01:56:27,271
"When the gentle breeze flows in.."

1884
01:56:28,147 --> 01:56:32,860
"When my eyes express the love.."

1885
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:35,822
"The nature is amazed"

1886
01:56:36,197 --> 01:56:38,658
"at your beauty every time."

1887
01:56:39,117 --> 01:56:41,536
"It rains, it rains."

1888
01:56:42,370 --> 01:56:44,622
"My heart starts racing!"

1889
01:56:45,957 --> 01:56:48,042
"My heart goes crazy"

1890
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:51,462
"when you look at me."

1891
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:53,881
"A world of our own"

1892
01:56:54,048 --> 01:56:57,176
"where we live together."

1893
01:56:57,343 --> 01:57:02,265
"The look in your eyes conveys
your love like a blazing fire."

1894
01:57:03,141 --> 01:57:08,479
"My heart has gone crazy
over the words you conveyed in silence."

1895
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:14,277
"The look in your eyes conveys
your love like a blazing fire."

1896
01:57:14,736 --> 01:57:20,158
"My heart has gone crazy
over the words you conveyed in silence."

1897
01:57:45,432 --> 01:57:46,517
Tell me, Mahi.

1898
01:57:47,142 --> 01:57:48,185
You don't have to come.

1899
01:57:48,769 --> 01:57:49,895
I'm a little disturbed.

1900
01:57:50,312 --> 01:57:52,022
I'm on my way
to Pondicherry Ashram.

1901
01:57:52,189 --> 01:57:53,440
I'll let you know once I'm back.

1902
01:58:49,914 --> 01:58:51,373
<i>Push.</i>

1903
01:58:52,291 --> 01:58:53,250
<i>Pull.</i>

1904
01:58:53,584 --> 01:58:54,585
<i>Push.</i>

1905
01:58:55,002 --> 01:58:56,045
<i>Pull.</i>

1906
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:57,546
<i>Push.</i>

1907
01:58:58,088 --> 01:58:59,048
<i>Pull.</i>

1908
01:59:24,657 --> 01:59:25,783
<i>Kumar.</i>

1909
01:59:26,325 --> 01:59:29,495
<i>I'm not sure
if you will find this footage.</i>

1910
01:59:30,538 --> 01:59:31,789
<i>Even if you find it..</i>

1911
01:59:31,997 --> 01:59:36,126
<i>I'm not sure if I'll be alive
when you watch it.</i>

1912
01:59:37,503 --> 01:59:40,172
<i>She shouldn't escape. Finish her
the very second you find her.</i>

1913
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:46,345
<i>They molested me.</i>

1914
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:54,019
This is a report
from the Miss India organizers.

1915
01:59:54,645 --> 01:59:58,107
Wasn't it when you were about
to walk the ramp in the final round

1916
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:00,317
that they gave you the news
about your father's death?

1917
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:01,944
The time then was 7:15.

1918
02:00:02,236 --> 02:00:05,656
But Sidharth planned your father's
murder and executed it at 7:45.

1919
02:00:07,074 --> 02:00:10,536
He did that to disturb you emotionally
and make you dependent on him.

1920
02:00:10,995 --> 02:00:13,247
Ananya was crowned
the winner instead.

1921
02:00:13,914 --> 02:00:16,292
He is making use of her in his
business in every possible way.

1922
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,170
This is the FIR copy

1923
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:20,337
and this is the postmortem report.

1924
02:00:20,504 --> 02:00:22,673
Don't trust him anymore, Shilpa.

1925
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:28,053
They are Manimekalai's parents.

1926
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:31,390
Greetings. - You'll find all the related
documents in this file. - Yeah.

1927
02:00:31,765 --> 02:00:32,892
Okay.

1928
02:00:33,184 --> 02:00:35,519
Manimekalai would always think
about the research.

1929
02:00:36,061 --> 02:00:38,189
We never expected things
to go so bad for her.

1930
02:00:38,522 --> 02:00:40,774
Only after meeting him,
we've gained some confidence.

1931
02:00:41,317 --> 02:00:42,234
Look at this atrocity.

1932
02:00:42,443 --> 02:00:44,653
Tomorrow, at CM's press meet

1933
02:00:44,904 --> 02:00:46,530
they'll declare
that generic medicines

1934
02:00:46,697 --> 02:00:49,408
won't be approved and that
the old agreement will hold good.

1935
02:00:49,992 --> 02:00:52,077
Check the fax I've sent you.
- Yes.

1936
02:00:52,286 --> 02:00:53,370
I've received the fax.

1937
02:00:53,579 --> 02:00:54,747
I'll look into it.

1938
02:01:04,924 --> 02:01:08,344
Shilpa.
Replace it with this file.

1939
02:01:08,761 --> 02:01:10,513
Just do this one favor.

1940
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:16,560
Ashok.

1941
02:01:16,727 --> 02:01:18,395
You accompany dad for the press meet.

1942
02:01:18,979 --> 02:01:20,606
Inform me as soon as the CM arrives.

1943
02:01:20,773 --> 02:01:21,899
I'll join you.

1944
02:01:22,107 --> 02:01:24,985
This is a policy that will benefit us.
- Sure.

1945
02:01:25,152 --> 02:01:28,948
I'll reach there along with your dad
and inform you once the CM arrives.

1946
02:01:29,156 --> 02:01:31,116
Ensure a good press coverage.
- Okay.

1947
02:01:38,833 --> 02:01:41,627
Pramod.. We've had a good
breakthrough by following Vicky.

1948
02:01:41,794 --> 02:01:43,212
Inspector Logu had messaged.

1949
02:01:43,379 --> 02:01:45,297
He has accepted
that he had molested Manimekalai

1950
02:01:45,464 --> 02:01:47,925
and had sketched out a plan to hook the
charges against other innocent fellows.

1951
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:49,426
He seems to be inebriated.

1952
02:01:49,885 --> 02:01:51,595
I called up Logu
to find out more details

1953
02:01:51,846 --> 02:01:53,722
but looks like something is wrong.
He is not responding to my calls.

1954
02:01:53,889 --> 02:01:57,601
They are near Vadapalani,
but we don't have the exact location.

1955
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:05,860
I've an idea.

1956
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:08,737
I'll talk to Perumal Swamy
mimicking Sidharth

1957
02:02:09,029 --> 02:02:12,825
and find out about Vicky's location. I'll
inform you as soon as I get the details.

1958
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:15,369
Until then, you guys head
to Vadapalani with the team.

1959
02:02:15,536 --> 02:02:17,538
We must arrest Vicky today.

1960
02:02:18,789 --> 02:02:22,960
Tell us the truth.
- Come on, speak up!

1961
02:02:26,255 --> 02:02:27,756
Tell us the truth.
- Won't you open your mouth?

1962
02:02:28,591 --> 02:02:29,508
Call Vicky.

1963
02:02:33,012 --> 02:02:35,973
<i>The number you've called
is currently not reachable.</i>

1964
02:02:36,390 --> 02:02:37,766
Call Perumal Swamy.

1965
02:02:39,143 --> 02:02:40,978
Silent, it's Mr. Sidharth.

1966
02:02:41,562 --> 02:02:43,522
Hello.
- Where are you?

1967
02:02:44,565 --> 02:02:45,524
At Poral Gardens, sir.

1968
02:02:45,941 --> 02:02:48,319
Where is Vicky?
- He is in Vadapalani.

1969
02:02:48,652 --> 02:02:50,946
Mithran is out to nab Vicky.
Alert him.

1970
02:02:51,405 --> 02:02:53,282
Okay, sir.
- Mithran will call you.

1971
02:02:53,699 --> 02:02:55,910
He'll mimic me and try to get
Vicky's details. Don't get fooled.

1972
02:02:56,076 --> 02:02:58,037
Who me?
Come on, sir.

1973
02:02:58,412 --> 02:03:00,289
Leave that to me.
I'll handle it.

1974
02:03:00,873 --> 02:03:03,292
Pramod, looks like I don't
have to call Perumal Swamy.

1975
02:03:03,501 --> 02:03:04,502
Vicky isn't in Vadapalani.

1976
02:03:04,668 --> 02:03:05,878
Using his mobile signal,
we have traced his location.

1977
02:03:06,045 --> 02:03:08,255
He is at his ECR guest house.

1978
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:09,757
I'm on my way.

1979
02:03:10,174 --> 02:03:11,634
You reach there with the team.

1980
02:03:12,968 --> 02:03:14,220
Call Perumal Swamy.

1981
02:03:15,596 --> 02:03:17,473
Just like sir said,
Mithran has called.

1982
02:03:18,724 --> 02:03:22,228
Hello. - Is your brother
in ECR or Vadapalani?

1983
02:03:22,394 --> 02:03:26,357
Listen, I'm an expert,
you can't cheat me!

1984
02:03:26,857 --> 02:03:28,317
Perumal, it's me Sidharth!

1985
02:03:28,651 --> 02:03:32,822
Stop your pranks
and mind your business!

1986
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:39,203
Call Ashok.

1987
02:03:39,954 --> 02:03:41,038
Hello.
- Ashok.

1988
02:03:41,288 --> 02:03:43,541
I'm on my way, but I won't
attend the press meet.

1989
02:03:44,416 --> 02:03:46,335
Bring my dad out for a moment.

1990
02:03:56,762 --> 02:03:59,139
Why are you backing out, all of a sudden?
The CM is already here.

1991
02:03:59,306 --> 02:04:00,599
Dad will take care of everything.

1992
02:04:00,766 --> 02:04:02,601
I'm sure he can handle it.

1993
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:04,603
This is an important press meet.

1994
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:06,564
You will find the speech in this file.
- Okay.

1995
02:04:06,730 --> 02:04:08,232
Just read it out.
- Okay.

1996
02:04:08,482 --> 02:04:11,152
I'll do exactly as you said.

1997
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:12,570
Head.

1998
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:18,159
And forcefully, we shoved
drugs into IPS Officer Jana's mouth.

1999
02:04:18,409 --> 02:04:20,661
We left him on the highway
and let him die.

2000
02:04:23,205 --> 02:04:25,166
Leave me.
- Inhale it.

2001
02:04:26,208 --> 02:04:27,793
Don't you love it?

2002
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:29,753
Inhale it!

2003
02:04:34,967 --> 02:04:36,093
Leave me!

2004
02:04:37,136 --> 02:04:38,179
Now, go lie down.

2005
02:04:40,973 --> 02:04:43,184
Now, our respected health minister
will present

2006
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,352
a detailed report on generic medicines.

2007
02:04:46,937 --> 02:04:51,233
Greetings. Last month, when I was instated
as the health minister

2008
02:04:51,692 --> 02:04:57,198
I promised to transform Tamil Nadu
into a disease free state.

2009
02:04:57,448 --> 02:04:58,449
Did that succeed?

2010
02:04:58,657 --> 02:05:02,369
So far, it hasn't and I don't see it
happening in the future, too.

2011
02:05:04,705 --> 02:05:05,706
Even now

2012
02:05:06,165 --> 02:05:10,127
I've been ordered to convey that generic
medicines won't be available at low rates.

2013
02:05:11,295 --> 02:05:13,589
I want to bring out the truth.

2014
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:17,676
What's happening?

2015
02:05:19,970 --> 02:05:27,269
When Ms. Angelina decided to reduce
the rates of cancer medicines

2016
02:05:27,436 --> 02:05:30,147
the businessmen here set up a meeting
with the chief minister.

2017
02:05:31,816 --> 02:05:34,777
They claimed that if those medicines
were made available at cheap rates

2018
02:05:35,194 --> 02:05:37,613
their business would incur a huge loss.

2019
02:05:37,822 --> 02:05:41,742
Hence, they put forward a request
to the CM to stop it from happening.

2020
02:05:42,701 --> 02:05:45,246
A huge amount was exchanged
in the name of this shameful act!

2021
02:05:46,455 --> 02:05:50,501
They made the minority minister
their puppet.

2022
02:05:50,668 --> 02:05:51,752
Leader.

2023
02:05:52,211 --> 02:05:54,129
Hold on.
- What are you blabbering? Shut up!

2024
02:05:54,338 --> 02:05:55,756
Why are they getting furious?
- Just shut your mouth!

2025
02:05:56,298 --> 02:05:58,342
My son promised me that he would
make me the CM one day.

2026
02:05:58,509 --> 02:05:59,635
I guess, this is the right time for it.

2027
02:06:03,556 --> 02:06:04,598
The MD of Pixim

2028
02:06:04,849 --> 02:06:07,184
had signed an agreement
before her death.

2029
02:06:07,476 --> 02:06:11,689
I have risked my life to get it
from the custody of the CM.

2030
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:16,152
Where is it? - I don't understand.
What is he up to? - Show it here.

2031
02:06:18,988 --> 02:06:22,199
Sit down!
- Who is behind this speech?

2032
02:06:22,449 --> 02:06:23,868
Sit down or else,
we'll finish you.

2033
02:06:24,034 --> 02:06:25,452
Calm down.
Sit down.

2034
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:28,122
I guess, next,
they will abuse and attack me!

2035
02:06:28,289 --> 02:06:29,707
They will cross all limits.
- Arrange a party meet immediately.

2036
02:06:29,874 --> 02:06:31,876
Sure, sir.
- Immediately.

2037
02:06:32,042 --> 02:06:33,377
What a trap my son has laid!

2038
02:06:33,919 --> 02:06:36,755
For having fathered him..
Thank you, Lord! - Sengalvarayan!

2039
02:06:47,683 --> 02:06:48,893
Come fast.

2040
02:06:52,479 --> 02:06:53,439
Vicky!

2041
02:06:55,649 --> 02:06:56,692
Vicky!

2042
02:06:58,903 --> 02:07:00,029
Vicky!

2043
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:04,617
What have you done?
Can't you control yourself?

2044
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:10,289
Vicky, they are on their way.
Be careful. Don't tell them anything.

2045
02:07:10,456 --> 02:07:11,749
Hey, Vicky!

2046
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:29,391
Listen to me.

2047
02:07:29,725 --> 02:07:32,436
Come on, tell us!

2048
02:07:32,603 --> 02:07:35,314
Get lost!
Go! Get out.

2049
02:07:37,483 --> 02:07:38,567
Are you going to come
with me or not?

2050
02:07:40,611 --> 02:07:41,737
Mahima, it's this gate.

2051
02:07:41,946 --> 02:07:44,532
Drive fast. - They are here and I'm
worried that you'll divulge everything.

2052
02:07:44,782 --> 02:07:47,076
Don't worry,
I'll tell them everything.

2053
02:07:49,245 --> 02:07:52,706
Is the camera on? We had doped Jana
and killed him.

2054
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:56,377
But I wasn't the one
who ran him over with my car.

2055
02:07:56,544 --> 02:07:57,753
That was Sidharth!

2056
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:11,433
Oh, my God!
- Darn it!

2057
02:08:11,684 --> 02:08:13,352
He was a prime witness!

2058
02:08:13,644 --> 02:08:14,812
Who could have done this?

2059
02:08:22,486 --> 02:08:23,487
Hello.
- Hello.

2060
02:08:24,196 --> 02:08:25,739
Why do you keep pestering me?

2061
02:08:25,906 --> 02:08:26,907
This better be important.

2062
02:08:27,074 --> 02:08:30,452
Instead of reading out the medical report
your dad is speaking ill of the CM.

2063
02:08:30,828 --> 02:08:32,621
It has caused problems.
- What are you saying?

2064
02:08:32,788 --> 02:08:34,331
The press is covering everything.

2065
02:08:34,498 --> 02:08:37,835
The party men are furious.
- Ask him to fake a heart attack.

2066
02:08:38,002 --> 02:08:41,172
Okay. - Ashok, admit him to a hospital
and update me. I'll be there.

2067
02:08:41,338 --> 02:08:43,716
The minority..
- Stop it.

2068
02:08:44,008 --> 02:08:46,135
It seems it wasn't your son
who had prepared this speech.

2069
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:47,178
Who else had prepared it?

2070
02:08:47,386 --> 02:08:49,513
There has been some misunderstanding.

2071
02:08:50,723 --> 02:08:53,142
Ashok, what now?
- Don't talk.

2072
02:08:53,309 --> 02:08:54,852
He asked you
to fake an heart attack.

2073
02:08:55,019 --> 02:08:56,103
Sir, I think,
I'm having a heart attack.

2074
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:57,438
The heart is on the other side.

2075
02:08:57,605 --> 02:08:58,772
When did that happen?

2076
02:08:58,939 --> 02:09:00,900
Get me his speech.
- Move. - Call the ambulance.

2077
02:09:01,066 --> 02:09:03,486
Sir, please tell us..
- Move, call the ambulance.

2078
02:09:04,737 --> 02:09:07,323
Move aside. He is not well.
- Please tell us more, sir.

2079
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:13,037
Sorry for the misunderstanding. I'll come back
and meet you. Take me to a good hospital.

2080
02:09:14,497 --> 02:09:17,541
I was the one who asked him
to read out this good news

2081
02:09:17,833 --> 02:09:20,669
but I don't know why he altered
the speech and spoke otherwise.

2082
02:09:21,879 --> 02:09:23,839
Strict actions will be taken against him.

2083
02:09:24,131 --> 02:09:26,967
The generic medicine agreement
will be sanctioned tomorrow.

2084
02:09:33,265 --> 02:09:35,518
Sir..
- Sir, please answer our questions.

2085
02:09:38,354 --> 02:09:39,480
This is the report that was read out.

2086
02:09:49,532 --> 02:09:53,828
Come. Had you been late by a few minutes
I would have died of a real heart attack.

2087
02:09:54,119 --> 02:09:56,121
You wouldn't have seen me alive.

2088
02:09:56,330 --> 02:09:57,665
You are incorrigible.

2089
02:09:58,332 --> 02:10:00,125
Now, that's something
I don't understand.

2090
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:02,670
Dad, you remind me of a story.

2091
02:10:03,379 --> 02:10:04,296
Which one, dear?

2092
02:10:05,256 --> 02:10:07,091
Once upon a time,
there lived a king.

2093
02:10:07,925 --> 02:10:09,844
He never trusted his men.

2094
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:13,639
So, he had a well-trained
monkey for his protection.

2095
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:18,018
Round the clock, the monkey
was beside the king.

2096
02:10:20,521 --> 02:10:23,357
One day, while the king was asleep
a mosquito was disturbing him.

2097
02:10:25,067 --> 02:10:26,277
The monkey tried its best.

2098
02:10:27,069 --> 02:10:28,612
But it couldn't get rid of the mosquito.

2099
02:10:29,822 --> 02:10:31,615
Finally, the mosquito
sat on the king's neck.

2100
02:10:32,449 --> 02:10:34,451
So, the monkey took a sharp sword

2101
02:10:35,369 --> 02:10:39,206
and slashed at the mosquito
that was sitting on the king's neck.

2102
02:10:40,166 --> 02:10:41,167
The mosquito died, right?

2103
02:10:43,711 --> 02:10:45,421
No? Did the mosquito
survive the slash?

2104
02:10:48,966 --> 02:10:50,342
So, it didn't die?

2105
02:10:53,888 --> 02:10:58,142
There was a call from the CM's office
asking your dad to resign within an hour.

2106
02:10:58,392 --> 02:11:01,395
If he doesn't, they are planning
on dismissing him.

2107
02:11:07,651 --> 02:11:09,069
What is it, Mithran?
You said it was urgent.

2108
02:11:09,361 --> 02:11:12,364
I've received information from an informer
that Perumal Swamy's brother was killed

2109
02:11:12,823 --> 02:11:16,911
by Sidharth Abhimanyu and that
he has a video evidence of it.

2110
02:11:17,411 --> 02:11:19,997
I'll get more evidence
against him by tonight.

2111
02:11:20,539 --> 02:11:24,210
So, I need your support in completing
the formalities to arrest him tomorrow.

2112
02:11:24,585 --> 02:11:25,544
What are you saying?

2113
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:27,338
We have to arrest
Sidharth Abhimanyu?

2114
02:11:27,505 --> 02:11:30,049
He is a minister's son. He is a big shot.
Do you know that?

2115
02:11:30,424 --> 02:11:32,301
I guess you haven't
received the update yet.

2116
02:11:32,593 --> 02:11:34,845
The entire ruling party
is against him.

2117
02:11:35,346 --> 02:11:36,639
If you want,
you can immediately check it.

2118
02:11:36,805 --> 02:11:37,723
Are you sure?

2119
02:11:39,183 --> 02:11:40,184
Sir.

2120
02:11:40,476 --> 02:11:42,812
ASP Mithran is here
with evidence against Sidharth.

2121
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:47,399
He has asked to act on it
if the evidence are strong.

2122
02:11:47,691 --> 02:11:49,276
The CM has asked you to meet him
with the evidence.

2123
02:11:49,568 --> 02:11:51,529
Thank you, sir.
I'll get prepared for the meeting.

2124
02:11:51,862 --> 02:11:54,114
My brother!

2125
02:11:54,406 --> 02:11:55,324
Open your eyes.

2126
02:11:56,283 --> 02:11:58,661
My brother! - Let it be.
- What happened to him?

2127
02:11:58,828 --> 02:12:01,497
Be calm. We received an anonymous call
only a few minutes ago.

2128
02:12:02,957 --> 02:12:04,583
Call Perumal Swamy.

2129
02:12:05,668 --> 02:12:07,670
What is going on, Perumal?
- Sir.

2130
02:12:09,255 --> 02:12:10,714
They finished my brother.

2131
02:12:11,215 --> 02:12:13,843
I told you that Mithran
was searching for your brother.

2132
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:16,053
Did you pay heed?
Now, look what happened.

2133
02:12:16,303 --> 02:12:17,680
Sir.

2134
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:20,641
Give me Mithran's location.

2135
02:12:20,933 --> 02:12:22,518
I'll finish him.

2136
02:12:22,768 --> 02:12:25,062
Don't worry,
I'll help you do that

2137
02:12:25,563 --> 02:12:27,064
but before that,
you have another job to complete.

2138
02:12:27,314 --> 02:12:28,357
Tell me, sir.

2139
02:12:28,607 --> 02:12:30,568
Finish my dad.
- Sir?

2140
02:12:32,194 --> 02:12:33,154
You want me to kill your dad?

2141
02:12:33,612 --> 02:12:35,072
He has landed himself in trouble

2142
02:12:35,531 --> 02:12:36,782
and I'm afraid that he might
get us into trouble, too.

2143
02:12:36,949 --> 02:12:38,159
Call me once you finish him.

2144
02:12:38,742 --> 02:12:39,952
Okay, sir.

2145
02:12:53,215 --> 02:12:54,133
Sir.

2146
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:57,928
Just like you instructed, our driver finished
your dad on his way from the hospital.

2147
02:12:58,512 --> 02:12:59,430
Is he dead?

2148
02:12:59,638 --> 02:13:00,598
Did you confirm it?

2149
02:13:00,764 --> 02:13:04,018
It's confirmed, sir. He is burning
into ashes as I watch.

2150
02:13:04,143 --> 02:13:06,770
22 acres out of 370 acres..
- Yes, sir..

2151
02:13:06,896 --> 02:13:08,272
Greetings.
- Greetings.

2152
02:13:17,823 --> 02:13:18,991
Tell me.

2153
02:13:20,659 --> 02:13:22,077
Are you here to apologize?

2154
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:24,371
What is the use now?

2155
02:13:25,206 --> 02:13:26,957
You should have thought
about it earlier.

2156
02:13:29,084 --> 02:13:31,504
Why did you do this to my dad?
- What else did you expect?

2157
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:33,005
Did you expect me
to be a mute spectator?

2158
02:13:33,172 --> 02:13:35,216
He made a mockery
of all the medical schemes!

2159
02:13:35,549 --> 02:13:38,093
He insulted the government
and called me a thief.

2160
02:13:38,636 --> 02:13:41,597
This was not my call.
It was a decision taken by the party.

2161
02:13:41,805 --> 02:13:44,099
If I were to make a decision,
it would have been even worse.

2162
02:13:44,308 --> 02:13:46,268
What could be worse than this?

2163
02:13:47,269 --> 02:13:49,063
You killed him mercilessly!

2164
02:13:50,648 --> 02:13:51,941
Who me?
I killed him?

2165
02:13:52,107 --> 02:13:53,734
I'll talk to you later.
Please go.

2166
02:13:53,901 --> 02:13:55,361
Send them away.
- Did you guys hear that?

2167
02:13:55,528 --> 02:13:57,238
Didn't he just threaten saying
he would have taken a worse action?

2168
02:13:57,404 --> 02:14:01,200
Didn't you hear him say that? - Please leave.
- Don't bring shame to the party. - Go!

2169
02:14:01,450 --> 02:14:04,161
When did I kill your dad?
Tell me the truth. Is he dead?

2170
02:14:04,495 --> 02:14:06,455
This is ridiculous! You killed him
and now, you ask about it!

2171
02:14:06,622 --> 02:14:10,376
I didn't.. - Just because he spoke
ill of you, you killed him.

2172
02:14:10,543 --> 02:14:11,460
He is no more!

2173
02:14:11,669 --> 02:14:13,963
Don't believe all these rumors!
This is not a rumor.

2174
02:14:14,088 --> 02:14:16,465
The driver whose vehicle ran him over
said that the CM told him to do so.

2175
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:17,508
Which driver
are you talking about?

2176
02:14:17,675 --> 02:14:19,510
I'll get him here.
Why don't you ask yourself?

2177
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:22,263
Why would I kill Sengalvarayan?

2178
02:14:22,429 --> 02:14:25,724
I took him under me, I made him
the MLA and I made him the minister!

2179
02:14:26,058 --> 02:14:28,686
Believe me.
I didn't do this to your dad.

2180
02:14:30,062 --> 02:14:31,313
You are correct.

2181
02:14:32,857 --> 02:14:34,358
I killed him!

2182
02:14:37,403 --> 02:14:38,988
I heard that a warrant
is being issued in my name.

2183
02:14:40,197 --> 02:14:42,283
That one?
Since everyone around me persuaded..

2184
02:14:42,449 --> 02:14:44,243
You will issue one, is it?

2185
02:14:45,286 --> 02:14:47,371
I also heard that I'll be asked
to step down from the party.

2186
02:14:47,538 --> 02:14:49,582
Let me see that.
Try doing it!

2187
02:14:50,499 --> 02:14:54,545
57 MLAs in your minority government
are waiting for my orders.

2188
02:14:54,753 --> 02:14:56,255
What can you do?

2189
02:14:57,548 --> 02:15:00,176
Warrant?
- How do you do this?

2190
02:15:01,427 --> 02:15:02,887
You killed your father..

2191
02:15:04,763 --> 02:15:06,140
You are blaming me for that.

2192
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:07,558
For a moment, I..

2193
02:15:08,392 --> 02:15:10,269
I..

2194
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:12,313
How do you do it?
- I've made it a habit.

2195
02:15:14,106 --> 02:15:15,316
Didn't you get it?

2196
02:15:16,275 --> 02:15:18,777
Did you think that I took the blame
for your mistake, 20 years ago?

2197
02:15:18,944 --> 02:15:19,904
Wasn't it so?

2198
02:15:20,070 --> 02:15:23,240
Didn't I slam him on the table
and a glass cut through his throat..

2199
02:15:23,407 --> 02:15:25,993
The minute you attacked him,
I decided to go to jail.

2200
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:30,080
I saw my dad as an MLA.

2201
02:15:31,582 --> 02:15:34,210
But that fellow was holding on to his life.

2202
02:15:36,504 --> 02:15:39,006
I could have attained my goal
only if he died.

2203
02:15:39,507 --> 02:15:41,759
I ensured his death.
I finished him.

2204
02:15:42,885 --> 02:15:45,054
I know how to create
an opportunity out of nothing

2205
02:15:45,930 --> 02:15:49,475
and I also know how to pull it back
when it slips through my fingers!

2206
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:54,313
Now, what do you want me to do?

2207
02:15:54,563 --> 02:15:56,524
Appoint the person I say
in my dad's place.

2208
02:15:56,816 --> 02:16:00,528
Approve the statement I give regarding
generic medicine, as a government policy.

2209
02:16:01,153 --> 02:16:02,947
No action should be taken against me.

2210
02:16:03,364 --> 02:16:05,825
If someone comes up with an evidence,
bring it to me first.

2211
02:16:07,034 --> 02:16:08,828
I heard that you spoke ill of my dad.
Is it true?

2212
02:16:10,162 --> 02:16:13,332
Take it back and with a 21-gun salute

2213
02:16:14,917 --> 02:16:16,252
pay your last respects.

2214
02:16:17,253 --> 02:16:20,172
I'll let you know
if I need anything else.

2215
02:16:21,215 --> 02:16:23,676
People have elected me because they believe
that I do good deeds for them.

2216
02:16:24,009 --> 02:16:25,344
How can I cheat them?

2217
02:16:25,553 --> 02:16:27,513
Even God can't do good deeds
all the time.

2218
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:29,515
"I'm evil.."
Who are we when compared to Him?

2219
02:16:35,437 --> 02:16:37,857
Rally, steady, go!

2220
02:16:44,947 --> 02:16:47,741
Posse, fire!

2221
02:17:23,110 --> 02:17:24,361
My deepest condolences to you.

2222
02:17:32,953 --> 02:17:35,289
Every sensation has its end point.

2223
02:17:41,712 --> 02:17:42,630
Positions!

2224
02:17:50,262 --> 02:17:51,514
You are under arrest.

2225
02:17:57,269 --> 02:17:59,396
When I met you 20 years ago,
I was shocked

2226
02:18:00,231 --> 02:18:02,191
wondering what you would
do to this country.

2227
02:18:02,566 --> 02:18:04,026
Now, after 20 years

2228
02:18:04,735 --> 02:18:06,111
I am amazed to see him.

2229
02:18:06,362 --> 02:18:08,280
Master of masters will arise someday.

2230
02:18:08,823 --> 02:18:10,825
You began your life
in a beacon vehicle.

2231
02:18:11,450 --> 02:18:13,661
Now, there is another beacon vehicle
waiting for you

2232
02:18:13,828 --> 02:18:14,787
to write your destiny.

2233
02:18:15,162 --> 02:18:16,497
Go.

2234
02:18:16,956 --> 02:18:18,666
Are you even aware
of what you are doing?

2235
02:18:18,999 --> 02:18:20,501
Your questions

2236
02:18:20,793 --> 02:18:21,919
will be answered by him.

2237
02:18:26,006 --> 02:18:29,093
<i>Our country tops the list
of diabetic patients in the world.</i>

2238
02:18:29,552 --> 02:18:31,220
<i>A medicinal plant
known as sea weed</i>

2239
02:18:31,387 --> 02:18:33,347
<i>is available in plenty,
in our oceans.</i>

2240
02:18:33,514 --> 02:18:36,350
<i>Medicines for diabetes can be produced
from them at a lesser price.</i>

2241
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:39,937
<i>It can even cure the disease
permanently in six months.</i>

2242
02:18:40,104 --> 02:18:42,064
<i>Believe me.
We have discovered this.</i>

2243
02:18:42,314 --> 02:18:43,524
<i>It's my effort.</i>

2244
02:18:43,691 --> 02:18:45,276
<i>I discovered this medicine.</i>

2245
02:18:47,194 --> 02:18:48,112
<i>Sidharth</i>

2246
02:18:48,279 --> 02:18:50,322
<i>is trying to make money
by selling it abroad.</i>

2247
02:18:50,489 --> 02:18:51,532
<i>If that happens</i>

2248
02:18:51,699 --> 02:18:55,369
<i>we may not get that medicine
for the next ten years.</i>

2249
02:18:55,661 --> 02:18:58,664
<i>In the greed to prepare
this medicine soon</i>

2250
02:18:59,165 --> 02:19:03,002
<i>he fed medicines made without
proper research to 18 children</i>

2251
02:19:03,419 --> 02:19:04,962
<i>and killed them brutally.</i>

2252
02:19:09,216 --> 02:19:10,968
<i>I'll get killed in sometime.</i>

2253
02:19:12,469 --> 02:19:13,387
<i>But..</i>

2254
02:19:13,596 --> 02:19:16,056
<i>But this evidence
will be worth all the sacrifice.</i>

2255
02:19:17,683 --> 02:19:18,684
Honorable Court.

2256
02:19:18,893 --> 02:19:22,813
This is a rare sea weed
found in abundance in our oceans.

2257
02:19:23,147 --> 02:19:25,274
If the foreign countries
get a patent on this

2258
02:19:25,441 --> 02:19:28,194
our country might have
to depend on them.

2259
02:19:28,652 --> 02:19:29,612
Honorable Court.

2260
02:19:29,778 --> 02:19:34,450
Mr. Sidharth killed Ms. Angelina
and acquired her company in Switzerland.

2261
02:19:34,742 --> 02:19:37,077
Through this company,
he tried selling

2262
02:19:37,244 --> 02:19:40,539
the medicine's formula worldwide
which he stole from Manimekalai.

2263
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:43,000
Evidence for this has been
produced before the court.

2264
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:47,546
Here is Vicky's statement
who had helped the accused.

2265
02:19:47,713 --> 02:19:51,175
<i>And forcefully shoved drugs
into IPS Officer Jana's mouth.</i>

2266
02:19:51,342 --> 02:19:54,303
<i>We let him wander on the highway.
We were responsible for his death.</i>

2267
02:19:59,433 --> 02:20:01,685
Ashok Pandian, Charles Chelladurai,
Perumal Swamy..

2268
02:20:02,019 --> 02:20:03,479
Having them as proxies

2269
02:20:03,646 --> 02:20:06,315
he corrupted Tamil Nadu in the name
of medical mafia and natural resources.

2270
02:20:06,482 --> 02:20:08,025
Here are the reports.

2271
02:20:08,192 --> 02:20:10,402
It includes their personal
phone calls and documents.

2272
02:20:10,861 --> 02:20:12,488
Yes, sir.
We checked the reports.

2273
02:20:12,655 --> 02:20:14,740
Whatever he said is right.
- Mr. Sidharth.

2274
02:20:15,241 --> 02:20:17,201
By tomorrow, if you don't give an answer

2275
02:20:17,493 --> 02:20:19,870
it will imply that you've accepted
all the accusations made against you.

2276
02:20:20,704 --> 02:20:25,501
The court orders to imprison
Sidharth Abimanyu in the sub-jail for today.

2277
02:20:26,126 --> 02:20:27,461
Mr. Mithran, take charge.

2278
02:20:28,254 --> 02:20:29,839
You have arrested him.

2279
02:20:30,172 --> 02:20:32,967
Let us kill him in an encounter.

2280
02:20:34,009 --> 02:20:36,637
Only if we shoot him brutally

2281
02:20:36,887 --> 02:20:37,888
will our anger subside.

2282
02:20:40,391 --> 02:20:42,226
We have even decided
the place for the encounter.

2283
02:20:42,643 --> 02:20:44,645
Tomorrow, when you
take him to the court

2284
02:20:45,104 --> 02:20:46,480
instead of passing via Anna Nagar

2285
02:20:46,647 --> 02:20:47,982
take a diversion
and pass via Thirumangalam.

2286
02:20:48,190 --> 02:20:49,525
We will take care of the rest.

2287
02:20:56,657 --> 02:20:57,783
Sir.
- Sir.

2288
02:20:59,827 --> 02:21:01,537
Let's avoid the mic, bug,
and these technologies

2289
02:21:01,745 --> 02:21:03,497
and have a private conversation.
What say?

2290
02:21:03,664 --> 02:21:05,207
You acted well without the bug.

2291
02:21:05,416 --> 02:21:07,418
Now, you want to act
as if there is no mic?

2292
02:21:08,085 --> 02:21:09,128
Pramod.
- Yes, sir.

2293
02:21:09,295 --> 02:21:10,379
We will wait outside.

2294
02:21:10,546 --> 02:21:11,755
Come.

2295
02:21:13,924 --> 02:21:15,009
Sidharth.

2296
02:21:18,429 --> 02:21:19,889
Shall we strike a deal?

2297
02:21:20,264 --> 02:21:22,433
Deal?
I like deals.

2298
02:21:23,559 --> 02:21:24,560
How much do you want?

2299
02:21:24,727 --> 02:21:26,270
100 crores?

2300
02:21:27,396 --> 02:21:30,107
200?
- Forget 100 crores.

2301
02:21:30,274 --> 02:21:33,652
Even if you want to give me
100 bucks, I'll have to approve it.

2302
02:21:34,403 --> 02:21:37,156
Your national and international funds
have been freezed.

2303
02:21:38,365 --> 02:21:40,201
As we speak

2304
02:21:40,367 --> 02:21:43,162
your business, real estate,
and mafia are being shut down.

2305
02:21:43,329 --> 02:21:45,956
We have arrested all those
who are involved.

2306
02:21:47,541 --> 02:21:50,544
Even the business that you wished
to begin on sugar medicine..

2307
02:21:50,794 --> 02:21:53,047
Patent rights have been reserved
in Manimekalai's name.

2308
02:21:53,255 --> 02:21:54,882
Now, those medicines
will be available in our country.

2309
02:21:55,090 --> 02:21:57,051
Patent rights
in Manimekalai's name?

2310
02:21:58,135 --> 02:22:00,262
She doesn't even
know the formula.

2311
02:22:00,429 --> 02:22:02,181
Just because she blabbered something

2312
02:22:02,348 --> 02:22:03,808
you will change the patent, is it?

2313
02:22:03,974 --> 02:22:07,394
I discovered it with a lot of effort
so that the world would recognize me.

2314
02:22:07,603 --> 02:22:09,605
I know that.
- You know that?

2315
02:22:11,065 --> 02:22:12,149
She did not blabber anything.

2316
02:22:12,566 --> 02:22:13,818
I made her blabber.

2317
02:22:15,069 --> 02:22:16,654
<i>It was first discovered</i>

2318
02:22:17,571 --> 02:22:18,823
<i>by Sidharth.</i>

2319
02:22:19,031 --> 02:22:21,617
<i>He is trying to make money
by selling it to foreign countries.</i>

2320
02:22:21,992 --> 02:22:25,120
<i>I fought with him
saying that I cannot allow this.</i>

2321
02:22:25,287 --> 02:22:27,206
<i>He replied saying.
This is my hard work.</i>

2322
02:22:27,373 --> 02:22:28,833
<i>I discovered this medicine.</i>

2323
02:22:28,999 --> 02:22:32,086
<i>So, he says, it is his wish
to make money out of it.</i>

2324
02:22:33,379 --> 02:22:38,008
I edited 'it is his wish'
to 'it is my wish'.

2325
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:40,010
She mentioned, it was your discovery

2326
02:22:40,177 --> 02:22:41,720
but I edited it and proved
that it was her discovery.

2327
02:22:43,013 --> 02:22:44,014
Played smartly.

2328
02:22:44,181 --> 02:22:45,933
I learnt it from you.

2329
02:22:46,684 --> 02:22:50,729
You have committed organized crimes
behind several emotional crimes.

2330
02:22:51,605 --> 02:22:56,193
I only needed one emotional crime
to put an end to your organized crimes.

2331
02:22:56,610 --> 02:23:00,322
To punish you for all your crimes, I needed
one crime that you hadn't committed.

2332
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:03,659
Do you wish to see
the response that it earned?

2333
02:23:05,369 --> 02:23:10,291
<i>He is making a living out of her discovery.
He should be killed.</i>

2334
02:23:10,457 --> 02:23:14,920
<i>If I get a chance to confront him,
I will beat him up.</i>

2335
02:23:17,047 --> 02:23:18,299
<i>He should be beaten up.</i>

2336
02:23:18,549 --> 02:23:19,967
<i>He calls himself a scientist.</i>

2337
02:23:20,134 --> 02:23:22,094
<i>He doesn't deserve
the Padmashree title.</i>

2338
02:23:22,261 --> 02:23:23,470
<i>First, seize that title.</i>

2339
02:23:23,637 --> 02:23:24,847
<i>And hang him to death.</i>

2340
02:23:25,014 --> 02:23:26,724
<i>He sat next to me
during the function.</i>

2341
02:23:26,932 --> 02:23:28,100
<i>I smiled at him.</i>

2342
02:23:28,267 --> 02:23:30,811
<i>But I cannot be responsible
if you associate me with him.</i>

2343
02:23:31,103 --> 02:23:34,398
<i>I haven't met him before and I don't
have any connection with him.</i>

2344
02:23:34,732 --> 02:23:37,151
<i>Please don't ask me about him.</i>

2345
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:40,863
In the name of organized crime

2346
02:23:41,071 --> 02:23:42,698
if I'd have said that you have killed
many people mysteriously

2347
02:23:42,865 --> 02:23:46,035
and that you ruined many lives

2348
02:23:46,327 --> 02:23:48,496
they would have ignored it
and told me to mind my business.

2349
02:23:48,746 --> 02:23:50,539
But now, in front of the same crowd

2350
02:23:50,706 --> 02:23:53,000
I've labelled you as a thief
within a day.

2351
02:23:53,542 --> 02:23:55,503
That too, the label
of a knowledgeable thief.

2352
02:23:56,128 --> 02:23:58,130
All the ministers who claimed
that they don't know you

2353
02:23:58,297 --> 02:24:00,090
have arranged goons to kill you

2354
02:24:00,257 --> 02:24:03,552
the moment you walk out of here,
the only reason being they know you.

2355
02:24:03,719 --> 02:24:06,305
Now, it's a big deal for you
to reach the court.

2356
02:24:06,764 --> 02:24:08,766
You never know
how and who will shoot you.

2357
02:24:09,099 --> 02:24:11,268
Suppose you reach the court
despite all this

2358
02:24:11,519 --> 02:24:14,688
I will make sure, you are sentenced
to life imprisonment.

2359
02:24:16,148 --> 02:24:17,566
I hope you have understood now.

2360
02:24:18,359 --> 02:24:20,152
You have nowhere to go.

2361
02:24:21,695 --> 02:24:23,113
Shall we discuss the deal now?

2362
02:24:25,407 --> 02:24:26,659
<i>I was thinking of killing him</i>

2363
02:24:26,826 --> 02:24:28,327
<i>even if it costs me my life.</i>

2364
02:24:28,577 --> 02:24:30,621
<i>Mahima told me to kill him
without losing my life.</i>

2365
02:24:31,789 --> 02:24:32,998
<i>But now, I say.</i>

2366
02:24:33,457 --> 02:24:34,416
<i>I should live</i>

2367
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:36,794
<i>and so should he.
- He should live?</i>

2368
02:24:36,961 --> 02:24:38,295
<i>I can't believe,
you just said that.</i>

2369
02:24:38,587 --> 02:24:40,130
<i>We lost Jana.</i>

2370
02:24:40,381 --> 02:24:43,551
<i>The one whom I destroy should result
in the destruction of 100 criminals.</i>

2371
02:24:43,717 --> 02:24:45,803
<i>I chose Sidharth for that purpose.</i>

2372
02:24:46,053 --> 02:24:47,179
<i>But if he lives</i>

2373
02:24:47,805 --> 02:24:48,764
<i>and speaks the truth</i>

2374
02:24:49,890 --> 02:24:51,475
<i>thousands of criminals
will be dead.</i>

2375
02:24:51,684 --> 02:24:54,562
<i>He is associated with many national
and international criminals.</i>

2376
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:56,021
<i>That's what we want.</i>

2377
02:24:56,480 --> 02:24:58,107
<i>To fulfil this purpose</i>

2378
02:24:58,399 --> 02:24:59,733
<i>Jana lost his life.</i>

2379
02:25:00,401 --> 02:25:01,735
<i>Just because he lost his life</i>

2380
02:25:01,944 --> 02:25:03,362
<i>and in the name of revenge</i>

2381
02:25:03,529 --> 02:25:05,072
<i>if I change my goal</i>

2382
02:25:06,115 --> 02:25:08,367
<i>it would be equivalent
to dishonoring his sacrifice.</i>

2383
02:25:09,285 --> 02:25:12,830
<i>All these days,
you believed me blindly.</i>

2384
02:25:14,206 --> 02:25:17,209
<i>Please believe me that I would
do the right thing even now.</i>

2385
02:25:32,224 --> 02:25:34,393
This is the bulletproof vest
that is going to save your life.

2386
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:35,728
The deal is simple.

2387
02:25:35,895 --> 02:25:38,272
I give back
your life and freedom.

2388
02:25:39,148 --> 02:25:41,984
All the criminals who are fearless
of the Indian police department

2389
02:25:42,109 --> 02:25:42,985
are afraid of you.

2390
02:25:43,194 --> 02:25:45,362
All their secrets
are in your hands.

2391
02:25:45,654 --> 02:25:46,655
I need them.

2392
02:25:47,656 --> 02:25:49,033
Wear this bulletproof vest.

2393
02:25:49,283 --> 02:25:53,037
When we go out, the police department's
best shooter will shoot you.

2394
02:25:53,996 --> 02:25:55,331
But nothing will happen to you.

2395
02:25:55,623 --> 02:25:57,583
Let people
who are waiting to kill you

2396
02:25:57,750 --> 02:25:59,084
think that you are dead.

2397
02:26:00,336 --> 02:26:01,712
With the support
of the government

2398
02:26:01,879 --> 02:26:05,007
I take the responsibility of keeping you safe
under the Witness Protection Program.

2399
02:26:05,216 --> 02:26:08,886
In order to bring forward
all the VIPs cheating the country

2400
02:26:09,053 --> 02:26:11,180
I give you this offer to help me.

2401
02:26:11,806 --> 02:26:14,391
You know you cannot escape.

2402
02:26:14,725 --> 02:26:16,560
But if you think you can

2403
02:26:17,019 --> 02:26:18,145
look there.

2404
02:26:32,868 --> 02:26:37,498
I came to know through Perumal Swamy
that you had planned to kill your father.

2405
02:26:47,341 --> 02:26:48,259
<i>Sir.</i>

2406
02:26:48,467 --> 02:26:51,846
<i>As you said, our driver killed your dad
on his way from the hospital.</i>

2407
02:26:52,763 --> 02:26:53,681
<i>Is he dead?</i>

2408
02:26:53,931 --> 02:26:55,766
<i>Did you confirm it?
- Sir, it is confirmed.</i>

2409
02:26:56,433 --> 02:27:00,104
The ashes for which you paid respects
with the 21-gun salute..

2410
02:27:01,689 --> 02:27:03,482
Do you know
whose ashes those were?

2411
02:27:03,691 --> 02:27:06,193
It was my friend Jana's,
whom you had killed brutally.

2412
02:27:11,615 --> 02:27:14,785
Everybody present there knew
that it was Jana's ashes.

2413
02:27:15,536 --> 02:27:16,704
Except for you.

2414
02:27:21,417 --> 02:27:22,501
Give me..

2415
02:27:24,253 --> 02:27:25,337
Give me five minutes.

2416
02:27:28,048 --> 02:27:29,508
I hope you'll
take the right decision.

2417
02:27:54,909 --> 02:27:56,202
Are you fine, Pazhani?

2418
02:27:58,871 --> 02:28:01,832
You've forced me to bring the cops
along to safeguard myself from you.

2419
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:03,834
By killing everyone

2420
02:28:04,335 --> 02:28:06,462
and by being alone,
what are you planning to achieve?

2421
02:28:06,795 --> 02:28:09,006
Being with people is happiness.

2422
02:28:09,423 --> 02:28:11,967
If you aren't aware of that truth,
what is the purpose of wisdom?

2423
02:28:13,928 --> 02:28:15,304
Pazhani.

2424
02:28:15,846 --> 02:28:17,890
I did everything as you said.

2425
02:28:18,265 --> 02:28:19,350
This one time..

2426
02:28:19,558 --> 02:28:21,143
This one time, please listen to me.

2427
02:28:22,394 --> 02:28:23,771
Wear this vest.

2428
02:28:24,563 --> 02:28:25,481
Please don't think too much.

2429
02:28:27,817 --> 02:28:31,111
He is a murderer!
- Hang him to death!

2430
02:28:32,488 --> 02:28:35,616
Hang him to death!
- Hang him to death!

2431
02:28:36,242 --> 02:28:39,203
Ministers, businessmen
and the other VIPs..

2432
02:28:46,961 --> 02:28:48,045
Come.

2433
02:28:52,967 --> 02:28:56,971
"I don't care who it is, nor do I care
if you are the Lord of Death."

2434
02:28:57,179 --> 02:28:58,597
Good choice, Sidharth.

2435
02:28:59,390 --> 02:29:03,102
"Even if I live.." - Suraj.
- Tell me, Mithran.

2436
02:29:03,269 --> 02:29:04,270
Everything as per plan.

2437
02:29:04,436 --> 02:29:10,484
Take position. - Okay. "I don't care
for the money, nor do I care for the corpse."

2438
02:29:10,651 --> 02:29:15,656
"For my survival, I'll sacrifice anyone!"

2439
02:29:15,823 --> 02:29:16,824
Put him inside the van.

2440
02:29:17,491 --> 02:29:18,492
Can this vest

2441
02:29:18,659 --> 02:29:19,743
take the sniper?

2442
02:29:20,202 --> 02:29:21,162
Definitely, it will.

2443
02:29:21,412 --> 02:29:22,538
This is type 3 A.

2444
02:29:22,746 --> 02:29:24,915
It has been reinforced
with ceramic and metal.

2445
02:29:25,124 --> 02:29:26,292
Specially for sniper.

2446
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:27,960
I see.

2447
02:29:31,130 --> 02:29:32,381
Arrest him.

2448
02:29:34,508 --> 02:29:35,968
Sidharth!
Down! Down!

2449
02:29:36,135 --> 02:29:37,094
Down! Down!
- Move. Fast.

2450
02:29:38,888 --> 02:29:43,934
Sidharth Abhimanyu!
- Down! Down!

2451
02:29:44,101 --> 02:29:47,771
Kill him!
- Don't spare him!

2452
02:29:53,736 --> 02:29:56,113
Sidharth!
- Down! Down!

2453
02:29:58,824 --> 02:30:01,785
"Better think, better go."

2454
02:30:01,952 --> 02:30:05,498
"A human wandering in the form
of an animal, that's me."

2455
02:30:05,664 --> 02:30:08,751
"Better think, better go.
A human wandering.."

2456
02:30:08,918 --> 02:30:11,504
Do you see the line marked near the man
standing there? That's your mark.

2457
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:13,339
<i>"Do not allow anyone
at the entrance."</i>

2458
02:30:16,759 --> 02:30:18,677
Suraj.
Target approaching mark.

2459
02:30:18,844 --> 02:30:19,845
Take aim.

2460
02:30:20,054 --> 02:30:21,055
I am at the vantage point.

2461
02:30:21,222 --> 02:30:22,223
Ready.

2462
02:30:38,405 --> 02:30:39,573
Sidharth!
Move!

2463
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:54,004
No.

2464
02:30:58,008 --> 02:30:59,093
Suraj.

2465
02:31:06,183 --> 02:31:07,601
Suraj..
No!

2466
02:31:12,273 --> 02:31:14,024
Why didn't you wear
the bulletproof vest?

2467
02:31:15,317 --> 02:31:16,443
I don't need it.

2468
02:31:17,528 --> 02:31:18,821
You'll need it.

2469
02:31:19,697 --> 02:31:21,615
How many times do I have to say?

2470
02:31:42,094 --> 02:31:43,679
Sidharth!
Sidharth!

2471
02:31:45,681 --> 02:31:46,682
Sidharth!

2472
02:31:47,766 --> 02:31:48,726
Ambulance!

2473
02:31:48,893 --> 02:31:49,935
Call the ambulance.

2474
02:31:50,186 --> 02:31:51,437
Sidharth, stay with me.

2475
02:31:51,770 --> 02:31:52,688
When a lover shoots

2476
02:31:52,855 --> 02:31:54,148
you die in the arms of your enemy.

2477
02:31:54,315 --> 02:31:55,483
It's a common phrase, right?

2478
02:31:56,609 --> 02:31:57,568
Come.

2479
02:32:00,279 --> 02:32:01,405
Why are you worried?

2480
02:32:01,906 --> 02:32:03,866
Are you worried
because I am dying

2481
02:32:04,283 --> 02:32:06,660
or is it because I did not
provide you with the evidence?

2482
02:32:06,827 --> 02:32:07,828
This is not the time.

2483
02:32:07,995 --> 02:32:09,455
Come.
Get up.

2484
02:32:09,747 --> 02:32:11,207
I gave the evidence
you asked for.

2485
02:32:12,541 --> 02:32:13,876
I gave it to you.

2486
02:32:14,335 --> 02:32:15,377
Tell me how.

2487
02:32:15,628 --> 02:32:17,963
Let's discuss this later.
- Think over it.

2488
02:32:19,882 --> 02:32:21,300
Think..
I don't have much time.

2489
02:32:23,010 --> 02:32:24,053
<i>I don't need it.</i>

2490
02:32:25,346 --> 02:32:26,847
<i>You'll need it.</i>

2491
02:32:29,350 --> 02:32:30,351
Bulletproof vest.

2492
02:32:32,436 --> 02:32:33,813
I did not accept
the life you gave.

2493
02:32:35,022 --> 02:32:36,524
Instead, I gave you
the life you asked for.

2494
02:32:37,191 --> 02:32:38,609
Not for the country.

2495
02:32:41,403 --> 02:32:42,404
Only because you asked for it.

2496
02:32:43,197 --> 02:32:44,114
For you.

2497
02:32:44,281 --> 02:32:49,829
"I don't care if it's injustice,
nor do I care for the injuries.."

2498
02:32:50,204 --> 02:32:56,126
"Whatever it is,
I'll turn them in my favor!"

2499
02:32:56,293 --> 02:33:01,966
"After I win this world,
I'll walk up to the top."

2500
02:33:02,132 --> 02:33:08,347
"I'll set up my reign
in a grand manner!" - Sidharth!

2501
02:33:13,853 --> 02:33:16,981
<i>There is anxiety in the air as there
are record arrests happening everywhere.</i>

2502
02:33:17,189 --> 02:33:21,944
<i>Enough evidences
have been received</i>

2503
02:33:22,153 --> 02:33:27,032
<i>against the corrupt
businessmen and ministers.</i>

2504
02:33:27,283 --> 02:33:33,080
<i>This involves Sidharth Abhimanyu's
underground business deals.</i>

2505
02:33:33,372 --> 02:33:35,040
<i>By threatening several VIPs</i>

2506
02:33:35,374 --> 02:33:41,380
<i>he had manipulated the agreements
in his favor and the evidence proves it.</i>

2507
02:33:42,173 --> 02:33:43,924
<i>Beyond all this excitement</i>

2508
02:33:44,425 --> 02:33:46,010
<i>there is another excitement within me.</i>

2509
02:33:47,678 --> 02:33:52,850
<i>The memories are still fresh about
the news I had read for the first time.</i>

2510
02:33:55,311 --> 02:33:58,272
<i>That of the police arresting
a 15 year old boy.</i>

2511
02:33:59,523 --> 02:34:00,566
<i>Why so?</i>

2512
02:34:01,317 --> 02:34:02,359
<i>For what?</i>

2513
02:34:03,068 --> 02:34:04,069
<i>I thought about it.</i>

2514
02:34:06,238 --> 02:34:09,366
<i>That news made by him
at that moment</i>

2515
02:34:10,075 --> 02:34:12,286
<i>was the news
that gave shape to my thinking.</i>

2516
02:34:13,037 --> 02:34:15,456
<i>In the midst of this garbage
do I hold my nose</i>

2517
02:34:15,623 --> 02:34:18,417
<i>and pretend that it isn't stinky?</i>

2518
02:34:19,752 --> 02:34:20,878
<i>Or</i>

2519
02:34:21,378 --> 02:34:23,380
<i>am I going to take
my hands off my nose</i>

2520
02:34:23,881 --> 02:34:27,134
<i>and admit that it stinks
and clean my surroundings?</i>

2521
02:34:29,136 --> 02:34:30,721
<i>A question I raised back then</i>

2522
02:34:32,181 --> 02:34:33,808
<i>for which my present life
is the answer.</i>

2523
02:34:35,518 --> 02:34:38,604
"If a lone man decides"

2524
02:34:38,771 --> 02:34:41,148
"there are no obstacles
that can stop him."

2525
02:34:41,315 --> 02:34:44,276
"If a lone man decides"

2526
02:34:44,652 --> 02:34:46,654
"the world will make way for him."

2527
02:34:46,821 --> 02:34:51,909
"When wrongdoing arises,
I'll stop it."

2528
02:34:52,660 --> 02:34:58,374
"I'll conquer the flames of evil,
everyday."

2529
02:34:58,541 --> 02:35:03,254
"I'm a lone man."

2530
02:35:04,380 --> 02:35:10,344
"I'm a lone man."

2531
02:35:10,553 --> 02:35:12,805
"I'm a lone man."

2532
02:35:33,742 --> 02:35:37,121
"Crack the whip to clean up the country."

2533
02:35:37,329 --> 02:35:39,790
"Lead the youth to glory."

2534
02:35:39,957 --> 02:35:42,960
