1
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,485
I need you!

2
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:00,308
Darling, you're the one for me.

3
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,712
And I'm the one for you...

4
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:08,310
I'm not the kind of a
girl who says that!

5
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:10,579
Darling, take my heart away.

6
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:13,057
I'll make you fall for me.

7
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:18,759
All these talks are just not me!

8
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,064
I'm a mystery, I'm fearless!

9
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:28,430
I'm truly special,
there's no one like me.

10
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:33,875
Singin', hey ya!
I'm a girl who spells trouble!

11
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,415
Singin', hey ya!

12
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:38,781
Say S for Sonia!

13
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:41,582
Hey ya!

14
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:44,354
I do as I please!

15
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:46,949
Singin', hey ya!

16
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:49,527
Say S for Sonia!

17
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:13,043
Hey c'mon!

18
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:16,383
The world is at my feet!

19
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,390
Girls, c'mon!

20
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:21,588
The world is at our feet!

21
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:24,129
We feel at home on the streets.

22
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:26,058
Who can dare stop us?

23
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:27,599
Moving on!

24
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:31,930
C'mon! The world is at my feet.

25
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,939
It's true! Full on!

26
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:37,135
I'm losing control.

27
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,401
The skies are beckoning me...

28
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,606
...to go on dreaming.

29
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:46,948
Singin', hey ya!
I'm a girl who spells trouble.

30
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,151
Singin', hey ya!
Say S for Sonia!

31
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:55,917
Sonia... Sonia...

32
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,161
Sonia... Sonia...

33
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,945
Everywhere, people's
hearts are broken.

34
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:24,183
Everywhere, it's a mess!
Don't you agree?

35
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,789
What a stress! Don't you see?

36
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,623
Is this what life's all about?

37
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:31,186
No! Never!

38
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,795
We'll make a world...

39
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:40,465
Yes, right here,
we'll make a world...

40
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,135
...full of happiness and cheer.

41
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,804
Only smiles, no tears.

42
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,641
I'm a girl who spells trouble.

43
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:52,207
Singin', hey ya!

44
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:55,147
Say S for Sonia!

45
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:57,820
Darling, you're the one for me.

46
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:00,223
And I'm the one for you...

47
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:05,528
I'm not the kind of a
girl who says that!

48
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:11,229
I'm a mystery, I'm fearless!

49
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:15,634
I'm truly special, there's
no one like me.

50
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:20,975
Singin', hey ya! I'm a
girl who spells trouble.

51
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:26,246
Singin' hey ya! Say S for Sonia!

52
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:31,514
Hey ya! I do as I please.

53
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:37,257
Singin', hey ya! Say S for Sonia!

54
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,543
You're grounded for two weeks.

55
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:58,045
You've got to be joking, mom!

56
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:00,616
I'm not a kid anymore!

57
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:03,749
I'll be turning 18 next month.

58
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:08,960
When you were 18, you were already
married and pregnant.

59
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:10,620
Don't remind me.

60
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,156
You can't do this to me!

61
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,026
Granny, help!

62
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:19,570
But mom, it was Christmas eve!

63
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:22,068
You mean you were at the
church till 3 a. M?

64
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:23,667
Nothing doing.

65
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,142
I want you back home before 9.

66
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,303
That's so unfair, mom!

67
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:27,637
One minute.

68
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:30,148
Did you take medicine for pressure?
Go and take.

69
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:35,744
C'mon mom! Teesha is getting
engaged this week.

70
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,750
She'll have to attend that.
- Yes!

71
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:40,016
And then new year's eve
is round the corner.

72
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:42,322
This comes only once a year!

73
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:45,121
And then it's my birthday
on the 10th!

74
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:48,993
That calls for a grand
party without a doubt!

75
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,126
Exactly!

76
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,137
I'll have to go to the night
club to book the DJ, right?

77
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:55,768
I've never been there
during the day!

78
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,837
9 pm. Your deadline
for the next 2 weeks.

79
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,612
Why just two weeks?

80
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,776
I won't go out for the
rest of my life!

81
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:10,779
But on one condition...

82
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:15,992
I want a birthday gift.

83
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:19,289
I want my dad.

84
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:29,364
Call him here, mom. Please!

85
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,835
Vikrant Raina means nothing to us.

86
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:34,070
That's what you think!

87
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,110
You've divorced him, not me.
- Sonia!

88
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:38,975
He's my dad, damn it!

89
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,083
You've kept us apart since 8 years.

90
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:43,753
But now, I've had enough!

91
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:48,087
I want to see my dad on my birthday.

92
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:59,204
Call him. 212-575-5555.

93
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,899
I know his number, and
other details as well.

94
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:05,701
But I didn't want to contact
him without your permission.

95
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:09,277
Here, call him.

96
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:15,876
Why don't you just go live with him?

97
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:18,687
Celebrate your birthday with him.

98
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:22,692
Forget me and whatever
happened to me.

99
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:26,759
Here we go again! This
emotional blackmail...

100
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,427
Sonia, enough!
- Let her speak.

101
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,233
I want to listen.
- What's the point?

102
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:34,696
Lt'll be the same old story again!

103
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,976
He's so cold, arrogant and selfish!

104
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:39,809
He's much more than that.

105
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,746
And once again,
I won't be permitted to meet him.

106
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,282
So what's the bloody point?

107
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:48,715
Sonia, wait!

108
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,725
He's my dad and I miss him.

109
00:11:55,261 --> 00:12:01,461
But does anyone care about
me or my feelings?

110
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,464
Sonia!
- It's okay, mom.

111
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:10,470
Let her go. She'll be back
once she calms down.

112
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:18,479
But when will you calm down, Mallika?
It's been 8 years now.

113
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:34,984
Who are you and what's all this?

114
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,149
What's this bloody place?

115
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:40,416
This is a kidnapping.

116
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:44,558
I've kidnapped you.

117
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:54,565
Yeah sure! Okay now...

118
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:58,340
Sara! Amrita! Divya!
C'mon out, girls!

119
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,641
Great idea for a surprise party!

120
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:06,952
Except that it's not
my birthday today!

121
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,580
No girls. No birthday.

122
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,658
Just me and this prison.

123
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:25,065
Okay now... game's up, girls!

124
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:26,933
Okay, you're forgiven!

125
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,336
Let's celebrate today itself.

126
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:31,273
How does it matter, right?

127
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:36,005
Sara?

128
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:40,947
Amrita?

129
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:47,685
Hey you dumbhead!
I've got to go right now!

130
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:49,748
C'mon, open the door!

131
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:56,025
Or else... what will you do?

132
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:59,462
I will...
- You can't do anything.

133
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,560
You're trapped.

134
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:07,163
You may have some tea though.

135
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:10,533
Want some?

136
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,450
Now open the goddamn door!

137
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:24,222
Enough! Don't push me.

138
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:30,125
Try and remember what
happened this morning.

139
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:35,157
You had gone swimming...

140
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,197
Ring a bell?

141
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,557
Do you remember now?
I've kidnapped you.

142
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:09,128
The sooner you understand
that, the better.

143
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,406
Yes Amrita, I'd been
to Sara's place too.

144
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:21,102
I've called everyone but she's
nowhere to be found.

145
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:23,172
That girl I tell you...

146
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,783
Let me know if she calls.

147
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:27,176
Alright?

148
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:33,455
I tried calling from my mobile
but it's still unavailable.

149
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,727
We must tell the cops...

150
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,130
Sonia, come home at once!

151
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:47,634
She can't. Not tomorrow,
not day after.

152
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:50,633
Or should we say never?

153
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:54,807
Because I've kidnapped her.
- Kidnap?!

154
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,817
Who's this? Where's Sonia?
- Wrong questions.

155
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:08,154
The right questions are, is she
alive? Will she ever come home?

156
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:13,188
That she's fine as of now is all
that should matter to you.

157
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,492
Would you like to speak to her?

158
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:21,168
Talk to your mom.

159
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:23,467
Mom...
- Sonia!

160
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:25,837
No, please don't hurt her!

161
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,173
Would you like to talk some more?

162
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:31,840
Take whatever you want
but don't hurt her!

163
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:34,917
I want you to follow two
simple instructions.

164
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:40,522
One. If you call the cops,
she'll be dead meat.

165
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:48,525
Second. I want Vikrant Raina on
this phone by noon tomorrow.

166
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,200
Vikrant? Why him?

167
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:54,863
Talk to me, I'm her mother.

168
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:56,941
I'll do as you say.

169
00:19:57,376 --> 00:20:02,211
I want him on the phone
by noon tomorrow.

170
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:05,648
Vikrant lives in America, he can't...
- He's in India.

171
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:09,443
What?!
- He is in India.

172
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,958
'People say I'm arrogant.'

173
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:24,561
'Yes, I am and proud of it!

174
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:28,737
'But the best part about me
though is that I'm greedy.'

175
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:32,574
'My day is made if someone
calls me cold-hearted.'

176
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:37,748
'Whatever else I maybe,
the fact is I'm very successful.'

177
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:42,849
'Lf somebody envies
my success, great! '

178
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:46,253
'Lf they hate me, even better! '

179
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:02,732
'Vikrant Raina. President,
Raina Incorporated.'

180
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:06,808
'Net worth, $ 51.7 billion.'

181
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,270
But do you know what
really angers me?

182
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:12,773
When someone takes me for a fool.

183
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:15,285
Someone has made that mistake...

184
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:19,688
...by swiping away $ 20
million from Raina Tech.

185
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:24,961
Three things can come
out of this meeting.

186
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:29,290
Either the thief should
come forward...

187
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:32,303
...or you bring him
to me by tomorrow...

188
00:21:32,371 --> 00:21:35,636
...or no one comes to
work from tomorrow.

189
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:42,309
And that is how it has to be!

190
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:02,322
What are you doing here? It
must be something important.

191
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:05,331
Let me guess, another court order?

192
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:07,902
Do you want to stop me
from coming to India?

193
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:13,505
No? Then you want a favor, right?

194
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:18,674
Of course, money!

195
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:21,610
Tell me, how much do you want.
I'll give you.

196
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:24,086
I've already given you enough.

197
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:28,757
Tell me, what do you want?

198
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:32,393
Because the only thing
I don't have is time.

199
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,092
Sonia...
- Sonia?

200
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:41,103
Sonia has been kidnapped.

201
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:06,893
Hello...
- You ditch!

202
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:08,125
Where the duck have you been?

203
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,133
What?
- Oh crap! Sorry, aunt. Teesha here.

204
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:15,134
I want to speak to Sonia.
Is Sonia around?

205
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:18,075
She's not reachable.

206
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:20,771
She's out of town.

207
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:23,747
How can she not come
for my engagement?

208
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,977
I'll tell her you called.

209
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:27,777
Bye. Take care.

210
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:28,911
Mom, did he call?

211
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:35,551
Hello!

212
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:36,685
The line was busy.

213
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:38,491
Preparing for a funeral?

214
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,456
Vikrant is right here.
Here, talk to him.

215
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,596
Vikrant Raina.

216
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:46,729
Papa?

217
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:49,165
Soni?

218
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:51,875
Papa, you're here!
You've actually come back!

219
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:54,446
Oh my God! I can't believe
it's really you!

220
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,781
I missed you so much!

221
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:01,178
I missed you too.

222
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:07,784
Papa, you're back home in India
and I'm stuck with him!

223
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:12,095
Don't worry. Now that I'm here,
I'll make things right.

224
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,696
Why did you not meet me
for so many years?

225
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:17,602
But why haven't you
seen me for so long?

226
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,472
It was mom and the court's decision
that I don't meet you...

227
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:26,204
...but I never said no, did I?

228
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:29,572
I...

229
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:31,081
Tell her, why have you
returned after so long?

230
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:37,546
Did you never miss her or had no one
stolen from your company before?

231
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,820
How do you know? Unless you have...

232
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,656
Guilty, your honor!

233
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:45,229
It was a piece of cake, actually.

234
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:48,599
All I had to do was press a few
buttons on the computer and voila!

235
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:52,493
Raina Tech's $ 20 million
disappeared...

236
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:56,166
...and you were on the
next flight to India.

237
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:00,740
The simpler the plan, the more
brilliant it is, right?

238
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,173
When you've already stolen a fortune,
why kidnap Sonia?

239
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:07,241
Your cash is still there
in your bank account.

240
00:25:08,253 --> 00:25:09,914
You see, I'm not after money.

241
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,185
I just want revenge...
with a little interest.

242
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:16,986
Who are you?

243
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:20,828
Your past... and your future.

244
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:24,259
You had ruined my life.

245
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:27,263
Now, it's my turn.

246
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,539
From this day, both you and
your daughter will be at my mercy.

247
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:36,911
Starting now, you'll
do exactly as I say!

248
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:40,843
Go to hell!

249
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:47,283
Hell is right here, Raina.

250
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,551
Get out! Get out right now!

251
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:53,226
Mom, ask him to leave right now!

252
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:56,793
You arrogant man, you're going
to get my daughter killed!

253
00:25:57,803 --> 00:25:59,771
Out of my house! Now!

254
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:01,901
You're overreacting as usual.

255
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:04,300
He'll call back.

256
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:08,569
Had I not hung up, he would've
had the upper hand...

257
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:11,775
...and there would be no
scope left to negotiate.

258
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:16,577
Can you hear yourself?
Did you hear your 'favorite' son?

259
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:22,652
He has my daughter!
He already has the upper hand!

260
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:23,786
Don't you get it?

261
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,328
I'll lose my daughter
because of you!

262
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:38,007
'Our' daughter.
Get that straight.

263
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:42,939
Listen, I can't explain
but he'll call back.

264
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:44,949
And that is how it has to be.

265
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:49,618
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

266
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:55,354
The phone will ring,
and it'll ring right now.

267
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:20,316
'Papa! Mom, please stop him! '

268
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:21,647
'Papa! '

269
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,914
'Papa, please don't go.

270
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:27,989
Mom, Please stop him! Papa, please!

271
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:34,723
Papa, please don't go!

272
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:18,303
I swear, Vikrant.
If anything happens to Sonia...

273
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:21,736
I will...
- Mallika!

274
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:32,313
'Which part of her body
should I send next?

275
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,388
Raina.

276
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:42,194
Nails can always grow back,
just remember that.

277
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:44,961
Listen, Vikrant will do as you say.

278
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:46,868
What do you want?

279
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,472
Apologize to sister Margaret.

280
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,300
Sister who? I don't get
what you're saying.

281
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:55,472
At 4:10, a train will pull
out of Panvel station.

282
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:57,743
Sister Margaret will be
on that train.

283
00:28:57,816 --> 00:29:00,478
She'll hand over a clue once
you apologize to her.

284
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:03,147
That clue will lead you to Sonia.

285
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:05,485
Is this some kind of a game?

286
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:11,059
Yes, and there are rules
too. My rules.

287
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:16,490
But if you miss the train,
game's over!

288
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:18,929
Just 40 minutes! It's ridiculous.

289
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:21,502
I'll never be there. It's rush-hour.

290
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:22,831
So fly!

291
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,471
Raina.
- So, where were we?

292
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,350
Yes, I was telling you
the rules of the game.

293
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:09,553
The rule is that you'll play alone.

294
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:11,113
The prize, your daughter.

295
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:15,486
You have to try to save her,
save her from me.

296
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,819
I've left you some clues.

297
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:21,563
Solve them and take her away.

298
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:24,001
That's what the game's all about.

299
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:30,230
Remember, only two players.
You and me.

300
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:34,007
No police. Understood or should
I go over it again?

301
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:37,577
My daughter's life is
a bloody game to you?!

302
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:29,259
That man ran away with the money.

303
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:31,234
They have jammed it!

304
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:33,899
Haven't I suffered damage?

305
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:39,569
Hey! Listen!

306
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,978
Hail Union Leader!

307
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:51,545
Hail Union Leader!

308
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:31,147
Are you okay, Mr. Raina?

309
00:33:36,361 --> 00:33:37,419
I know you.

310
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:33,535
Sister Margaret?

311
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:35,145
Raina here, give me the clue.

312
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:38,877
Hurry up, give me the clue!

313
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:40,811
What are you talking about?
What clue?

314
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:42,210
Ok...

315
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:46,351
I'm sorry! There... I said it.

316
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:50,159
So, you're the one.

317
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:57,533
There are better ways to say sorry.

318
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:04,840
'Mary had a little lamb... '

319
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,438
'80, 90, you had an upper hand.'

320
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:08,236
'After 90, you stopped further low.'

321
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:10,213
'You've sinned, now face the blow.'

322
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:11,805
'Mary had a little lamb... '

323
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,908
'I did the time, now the crime.'

324
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,679
What rubbish!

325
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,182
Who gave this to you?

326
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:23,194
I don't know. All he said was
to give it to the man...

327
00:36:23,261 --> 00:36:27,789
...who comes up and apologizes.

328
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:33,369
Send the car to Pen station now!

329
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,794
Are you sure it was
a computer error?

330
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:02,959
Is $ 20 million intact?

331
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:06,226
Okay Mehra, keep me in the loop.

332
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:10,332
Nothing's changed.

333
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:13,339
Even today, business comes first.

334
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:16,912
And you're still
as sarcastic as ever.

335
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:19,745
Who are these people?

336
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:21,281
My corporate security.

337
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,285
You've involved others?

338
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:26,582
Just Irfan. I trust him.

339
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:27,849
How could you, without asking me?

340
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:29,726
What for?

341
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:33,862
Oh no! Not again. Not one of those.

342
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:36,665
You never felt the need
to ask me, did you?

343
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:41,296
Always had your say in
our lives, remember?

344
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,265
Your wife's opinion never mattered.

345
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:50,003
But not anymore.

346
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:56,286
Listen! I know that
you don't like me.

347
00:37:57,522 --> 00:37:59,581
And you won't approve of
my actions.

348
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:01,616
But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

349
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:05,025
Irfan has solved two
corporate cases.

350
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:09,292
He rescued both the kidnap
victims in just four days.

351
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:11,525
Wrong. Well... almost.

352
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:14,300
I took 4 days for one
and 3 for the other.

353
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:16,901
I'll bring Sonia back.
That's my guarantee.

354
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:20,305
Vikrant, your security and house
staff are on leave from today.

355
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:21,436
Okay.

356
00:38:21,512 --> 00:38:23,036
Everyone except the cook.

357
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:28,684
Four of my most experienced men will
act as servants of the house.

358
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:32,555
That's Balram. Mohan...
Is the work done?

359
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:34,057
Sir, actually...

360
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:37,688
I don't have time to waste.

361
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:40,658
He's installing the caller ID.

362
00:38:40,732 --> 00:38:42,666
All incoming calls will
flash on the machine.

363
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:46,067
What if they don't? We should
also tap the phones.

364
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:48,862
That's already done. We've spoken
to the phone company.

365
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:54,007
Only you must engage the kidnapper
for at least 3 minutes.

366
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:55,340
Okay.

367
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:57,414
Specialized cameras have
been installed outside.

368
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:01,477
We'll be ready for him
if he pries on us.

369
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:03,786
They are Avinash and Shyam.

370
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:07,619
Why do you think he's after you?

371
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:13,088
God knows. But I've sent
for a list of my enemies.

372
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:21,098
Good idea. Keep this with you.

373
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:23,099
This is how you activate it.

374
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:26,775
Call me if anything. One more thing...

375
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:28,842
The clip has 8 bullets.
I have more clips.

376
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:33,708
No guns. Let's save them for
the cops and the criminals.

377
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:36,886
You may need it for protection.

378
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:40,386
It'll be too late by then.

379
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:42,684
No guns.

380
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:58,403
Love this song!

381
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:11,680
You hate my dad, don't you?

382
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:18,920
You really hate him.

383
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:28,565
I've been obsessed with
this plan for 3 years.

384
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:33,675
Plan to destroy Vikrant Raina!

385
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:36,976
But why me? What have I done?

386
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:40,909
Why not?

387
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:57,634
You did the cooking.
Let me do the dishes.

388
00:40:58,202 --> 00:41:02,901
No, you'll break them and
I can't afford new ones.

389
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:11,208
Kill me if I break
a single one, okay?

390
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:30,157
You like to play games?
I too like a game. Let's play.

391
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:34,622
Now I'm looking...

392
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:36,824
Now, I'm not...

393
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:41,237
Now I'm looking...
- Please stop this!

394
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:45,172
Please stop!

395
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:46,301
Please stop!

396
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:05,787
Try again.

397
00:43:58,316 --> 00:43:59,374
So what's she like?

398
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:06,722
She's very stubborn, just like you.

399
00:44:07,658 --> 00:44:09,057
Then you must be at dagger
ends with her too.

400
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:20,329
Had we not had that argument
on then maybe...

401
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:27,068
So your last memory with
her is an argument.

402
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:32,012
Funny, my last memories
are quite similar.

403
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:36,218
It was all your fault.

404
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:40,282
You kept me away for 8 years,
yet it's my fault?!

405
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:42,090
You were the reason why we fought.

406
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,694
She wanted you over on her birthday...

407
00:44:44,762 --> 00:44:45,820
...and you refused.

408
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:48,696
What do you expect after
what you did to me?

409
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:54,095
All I wanted was a divorce.
But you dragged Sonia into it.

410
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:58,036
Tried to prove in court that
I'm an irresponsible mother.

411
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:01,301
That I can't look after her.

412
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:06,715
You tried to say I was not
fit to be a mother...

413
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:12,245
...and used all your power and
influence to prove the same.

414
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,717
Why? Was it because
your ego was hurt?

415
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:18,920
No, I was angry.

416
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:25,868
How can I ever forgive you for
trying to snatch her away from me?

417
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:28,131
I was hoping that
in the fear of losing her...

418
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:30,139
...you would reconsider divorce.

419
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:33,733
I was just trying to stop
you from leaving.

420
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:45,079
Vikrant, wait!

421
00:45:50,828 --> 00:45:51,886
Go.

422
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:53,888
Raina.

423
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:55,022
How was your tour of 'Mumbai'?

424
00:45:56,367 --> 00:46:00,030
The name is not all that has
changed about the city.

425
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:02,495
I want to speak to Sonia.

426
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:07,235
I'm sorry. That's not possible.

427
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:08,505
Give her the damn phone now!

428
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:17,920
There's a slight problem, you see.
She's dead. - What?!

429
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:22,048
She's alive.
I didn't like your tone.

430
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:25,188
Now, let's talk business.

431
00:46:25,529 --> 00:46:27,520
Your next clue is on a
thousand rupee note.

432
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:30,258
And do I have to go to
the airport for that?

433
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:33,333
Do you own a nice suit, Raina?
- What?!

434
00:46:34,071 --> 00:46:37,131
You're going to an engagement party.

435
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:42,812
Your business rival Mahesh
Verma's daughter...

436
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,142
...Teesha is getting engaged tonight.

437
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:49,942
Teesha and Sonia are good friends.

438
00:46:50,154 --> 00:46:54,955
Very clever! You know very well
that Verma will never let me in.

439
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:56,953
How will I ever find the note?

440
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:05,558
I'll call in a bit. Wear your best
suit. You're going to a party.

441
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:12,098
Damn! It couldn't be traced.

442
00:47:12,576 --> 00:47:15,101
He hung up within 3 minutes.

443
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:16,571
First phone to Mallika...

444
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:19,378
...then three calls to you
and now one more.

445
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,983
Sometimes he calls from landline,
sometimes from mobile.

446
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,114
Each time, he calls from
different numbers.

447
00:47:24,588 --> 00:47:26,920
I'll have to go to Mahesh Verma's
house for the next clue.

448
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:29,854
He's interested in only two things.
One is to make illicit cash...

449
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:32,589
...the other to develop security
systems to safeguard the same.

450
00:47:33,597 --> 00:47:35,929
His is not a house, it's Fort Nox.

451
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,467
Gambling King Verma's house is on
the 5th floor of the hotel he owns.

452
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,895
Close circuit cameras cover
every inch of the hotel.

453
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,870
From the central monitor
room in the basement...

454
00:47:44,942 --> 00:47:48,605
...a guard keeps a tight
watch over the building.

455
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,076
He conveys the slightest of problems
to armed guards on the walkie.

456
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:57,280
You can take the hotel's lift
only till the 4th floor.

457
00:47:57,955 --> 00:48:01,083
Only Verma and his family members
can take it to the 5th floor.

458
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:04,219
A guard is stationed outside
the house's main entrance.

459
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:10,632
He checks the house every two
hours in Verma's absence.

460
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:14,894
The entrance door is armed with
an electronic security lock...

461
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:17,440
...the password of which
is changed daily.

462
00:48:18,242 --> 00:48:21,643
There are cameras everywhere in
the house, except for his study.

463
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:29,379
No one can enter this room as this is
where he stores all the illicit cash.

464
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:34,185
That kidnapper has definitely
gambled in his hotel.

465
00:48:34,258 --> 00:48:35,919
And that's how the thousand
rupee note got there.

466
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:37,320
And this is where you
have to reach too.

467
00:48:47,938 --> 00:48:49,530
Do you know where to park?

468
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:44,387
Come here, I'll show you something.

469
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:46,120
No thanks.

470
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:51,064
Well, if you don't want
to see your dad...

471
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:53,394
Dad!

472
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:55,595
Sir!
- Vikrant Raina.

473
00:49:57,341 --> 00:50:00,037
Sorry sir, you're not
on the guest list.

474
00:50:00,277 --> 00:50:01,335
Is it so?
- Yes, sir.

475
00:50:01,745 --> 00:50:03,406
You're making a huge mistake.

476
00:50:03,747 --> 00:50:08,150
If Verma ever finds out,
you all will be fired.

477
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:10,752
Sorry sir, let me check again.

478
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:12,079
Check quickly.

479
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:14,023
What are you doing here, Raina?

480
00:50:15,759 --> 00:50:19,627
I've come to wish Teesha
On Sonia's behalf.

481
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:23,761
I'll pass on the message.
You're not welcome here.

482
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:27,069
You better leave.

483
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:28,629
Security...

484
00:50:28,706 --> 00:50:29,764
Uncle Vikrant!

485
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,304
What a pleasant surprise!
Where's Sonia?

486
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:34,101
She couldn't make it...

487
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:35,770
Why are you standing here?
Please come in. - Come.

488
00:50:39,183 --> 00:50:40,309
Sonia couldn't make it.

489
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:43,780
But she insisted that I wish you.

490
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:47,647
Oh my God! That's dad!

491
00:50:49,193 --> 00:50:54,790
Teesha? Oh God! I forgot it's
her engagement today.

492
00:50:55,065 --> 00:50:57,659
Rajiv, this is my best
friend Sonia's dad.

493
00:50:57,735 --> 00:50:59,066
Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

494
00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:02,798
This is going to be so much fun!

495
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:04,465
I'll go get a drink.

496
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:06,805
Uncle, Sonia was
going to dance today.

497
00:51:07,144 --> 00:51:09,669
Since she's not here, I'm going
to drag you to the dance floor.

498
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:10,805
All right.

499
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,612
How did you do all this?

500
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:17,279
The only thing that's left free
in a prison is one's mind.

501
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:19,349
I took full advantage of
that freedom.

502
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:21,689
Became a computer whiz.

503
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:24,093
Bugged Verma's house with a chip...

504
00:51:24,161 --> 00:51:28,359
...to extract all the camera images
of the house onto my computer screen.

505
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:30,491
Cool, huh?

506
00:51:33,103 --> 00:51:34,161
You've been to jail?!

507
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:35,699
That's great!

508
00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:42,837
Yeah... - Meet him...

509
00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:21,409
Where's he gone?

510
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:24,549
To the monitor room, where
there's no camera.

511
00:52:30,494 --> 00:52:32,894
He's stopped the video
recording. Smart.

512
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:38,352
Yes!

513
00:54:12,863 --> 00:54:13,989
Where's he? Change it.

514
00:54:14,598 --> 00:54:17,396
In the study, where there's
no camera again.

515
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,401
I'll steal your heart from
right under your nose.

516
00:54:28,478 --> 00:54:31,003
Don't take me for an angel.

517
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:33,407
I am ravishing!

518
00:54:33,817 --> 00:54:35,751
I am stunning!

519
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:38,283
Look into my eyes...

520
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:40,686
You'll see a fire raging.

521
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:42,882
Don't be afraid.

522
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,292
Come close to me.

523
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:47,556
And then you'll see...

524
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:49,890
...that there's no one like me.

525
00:55:00,043 --> 00:55:04,707
I've come to win you over.

526
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:09,342
I've come to steal your heart.

527
00:55:09,586 --> 00:55:13,920
I've seized the moment.

528
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:17,918
I'm going to live it to the hilt.

529
00:55:17,995 --> 00:55:23,058
I'll steal your heart from
right under your nose.

530
00:55:23,467 --> 00:55:25,332
I am ravishing!

531
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:27,460
I am stunning!

532
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:30,066
Look into my eyes...

533
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,740
You'll see a fire raging.

534
00:55:57,434 --> 00:56:01,768
Hello! - Mr. Verma, someone
just broke into your study.

535
00:56:01,972 --> 00:56:03,030
What!

536
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:09,902
Security!

537
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:11,912
Be aware...

538
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:14,115
Someone is trying to steal...

539
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,994
What's life without love?

540
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:33,125
Love is worth dying for.

541
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:35,529
Love is all that's real.

542
00:56:35,739 --> 00:56:38,469
Life's meaningless without love.

543
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:45,006
What's life without love?

544
00:56:45,148 --> 00:56:47,139
Love is worth dying for.

545
00:56:47,484 --> 00:56:49,679
Love is all that's real.

546
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:52,012
Life's meaningless without love.

547
00:56:52,155 --> 00:56:53,417
Love is all that we need.

548
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:57,152
Love is worship, love is God.

549
00:56:57,494 --> 00:56:59,621
I am ravishing!

550
00:56:59,763 --> 00:57:01,822
I am stunning!

551
00:57:02,165 --> 00:57:04,156
Look into my eyes...

552
00:57:04,501 --> 00:57:08,164
You'll see a fire raging.

553
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:23,237
What do you mean he
was in a black suit?

554
00:58:33,256 --> 00:58:37,659
I know of your intentions, Raina.

555
00:58:41,865 --> 00:58:44,129
Everyone will be checked!

556
00:58:44,668 --> 00:58:47,603
Security, line them up. No one
should leave the premises.

557
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:51,272
How dare they rob me in my own hotel!

558
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:54,533
Frisk the black suits first!

559
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:33,307
There is nothing, sir.

560
00:59:52,335 --> 00:59:55,133
There's a clue written on
one of the notes. Find it!

561
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:57,064
Ballu, Shyam, do it.

562
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:02,736
Well done, Raina!

563
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:04,346
What do I do with the
rest of the money?

564
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:05,939
Leave that to me.

565
01:00:06,683 --> 01:00:08,014
Drop it where I tell you to.

566
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:11,017
I could do with some charity work.

567
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:47,383
Hey you! How can a criminal
ever get peaceful sleep?

568
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,394
Have you ever lived
a nightmare? I have.

569
01:00:55,732 --> 01:00:59,395
And all of this is just to
erase these nightmares...

570
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:06,071
Maybe one way of stopping these
nightmares is to sleep forever.

571
01:01:14,284 --> 01:01:17,685
'Eer, Beer and Fateh lived
together by the sea... '

572
01:01:17,754 --> 01:01:18,948
'... while me, I was just an orphan.'

573
01:01:19,422 --> 01:01:21,413
'Now I see them day and night... '

574
01:01:22,092 --> 01:01:23,684
'... but we talk only in my dreams.'

575
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:24,885
These clues are meaningless.

576
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:27,152
Mere tactics to divert
our attention.

577
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:30,164
No, they definitely
hold some meaning.

578
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:34,765
He's not my business rival.
It's something personal.

579
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:45,446
It's a restricted number.
Engage him for as long as you can.

580
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:47,774
Raina.

581
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:48,909
Quite the showman, aren't you?

582
01:01:49,052 --> 01:01:54,456
'After 90, you stooped further
low.' 90 denotes the year 1990.

583
01:01:55,325 --> 01:01:57,259
But 1996 onwards, I was in New York.

584
01:01:57,994 --> 01:02:00,394
That means, between 1991 to 95...

585
01:02:00,463 --> 01:02:04,456
Not bad. But it takes you not even
5 minutes to make an enemy.

586
01:02:06,403 --> 01:02:08,337
How many 5 minutes are there
in 5 years, Raina?

587
01:02:08,471 --> 01:02:12,737
I know who you are. You're
just a thief...

588
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:18,008
...who decided to be rich when
you saw a rich man like me.

589
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:23,479
You decided to steal. But of
what use is a petty robbery?

590
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:28,022
We both know that revenge
is merely an excuse.

591
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:30,157
You want to live life king-size.

592
01:02:30,427 --> 01:02:31,826
You want a lifestyle like mine.

593
01:02:32,829 --> 01:02:38,768
It'll all come down
to money in the end.

594
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:43,032
Let's cut this nonsense and come to
the final stage of the game.

595
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:45,169
How much do you want?

596
01:02:45,775 --> 01:02:50,303
How many million? Just name it.

597
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:56,512
I'm ready to lose to you for the
sake of my daughter. Deal?

598
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:01,786
Money is all that you
can ever give, Raina.

599
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:04,919
You seem so pleased with yourself.

600
01:03:05,862 --> 01:03:07,386
Do you think your sarcasm
really bothers me?

601
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:11,866
I'm tolerating your nonsense only
because my daughter is with you.

602
01:03:12,402 --> 01:03:15,530
You're a sad case if you think
you've matched up to me.

603
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:17,532
You'll remain where you are.

604
01:03:18,475 --> 01:03:21,808
You can't reach where I am by
talking to me over the phone.

605
01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:25,279
Or for that matter, by becoming
the richest man in the world...

606
01:03:26,216 --> 01:03:28,343
The fact is, you are a thief
and will remain one.

607
01:03:28,418 --> 01:03:29,476
Could it be traced?

608
01:03:29,552 --> 01:03:32,544
It's a landline number, fast!

609
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:36,349
What do you want?

610
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:38,554
There's very little water.

611
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:42,022
So?

612
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:46,091
I need more water to bathe.

613
01:03:46,836 --> 01:03:48,030
You've misused water.

614
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:50,235
I told you, there's limited water.

615
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,307
Take a dip or drown
in it, I don't care!

616
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:09,383
From now on, I'll do as
you say. I promise.

617
01:04:11,261 --> 01:04:17,063
But please try and understand,
I need to have a bath.

618
01:04:19,068 --> 01:04:22,060
Do something, please?

619
01:04:26,476 --> 01:04:27,534
Okay.

620
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,472
Got the location, let's go.

621
01:05:19,662 --> 01:05:24,656
O gentle breeze...

622
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:30,132
So soft is your touch
against my skin.

623
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:35,671
O gentle breeze...

624
01:05:36,012 --> 01:05:41,348
So soft is your touch
against my skin.

625
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:43,145
Is anyone watching?

626
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:44,686
It's playing sweet mischief.

627
01:05:44,954 --> 01:05:46,683
The weather is so awesome...

628
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:49,287
The weather is so awesome...

629
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:52,356
The weather is awesome... '

630
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:55,087
The weather is so awesome...

631
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:59,231
It's spreading magic all around.

632
01:05:59,569 --> 01:06:01,002
The weather is so awesome...

633
01:06:01,104 --> 01:06:03,368
The weather is so awesome...

634
01:06:03,706 --> 01:06:06,106
The weather is so awesome...

635
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:10,104
It's spreading magic all around.

636
01:06:38,007 --> 01:06:42,740
I'm dancing under open skies...

637
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:46,014
How do I thank you enough...

638
01:06:46,082 --> 01:06:48,346
...for such sweet delight?

639
01:06:49,218 --> 01:06:51,015
I'm losing control...

640
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:54,352
My happiness knows no bounds.

641
01:06:54,757 --> 01:06:57,555
I've lived this moment...

642
01:06:57,627 --> 01:06:59,424
Lived it to its fullest...

643
01:07:00,363 --> 01:07:04,766
As I know these moments
will never return.

644
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:07,633
The weather is awesome...

645
01:07:08,037 --> 01:07:10,437
The weather is awesome...

646
01:07:10,773 --> 01:07:13,241
The weather is awesome...

647
01:07:13,643 --> 01:07:16,771
It's spreading magic all around.

648
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:47,071
The breeze is playing mischief...

649
01:07:47,143 --> 01:07:49,805
...laughing all along.

650
01:07:50,613 --> 01:07:52,478
It tickles and blows...

651
01:07:52,548 --> 01:07:55,278
Leaves me wanting for some more.

652
01:07:56,352 --> 01:08:01,346
Who's that looking for me?

653
01:08:01,758 --> 01:08:06,422
Why do I feel so coy suddenly?

654
01:08:07,497 --> 01:08:09,089
The ambience is so wet...

655
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:12,100
I wonder what my heart wants.

656
01:08:12,235 --> 01:08:14,829
The weather is awesome...

657
01:08:15,104 --> 01:08:17,504
The weather is awesome...

658
01:08:17,707 --> 01:08:20,232
The weather is awesome...

659
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:23,838
It's spreading magic all around.

660
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:28,848
O gentle breeze...

661
01:08:29,185 --> 01:08:34,521
So soft is your touch
against my skin.

662
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:36,450
Is anyone watching?

663
01:08:36,526 --> 01:08:39,859
It's playing sweet mischief.

664
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:42,661
The weather is awesome...

665
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:45,527
The weather is awesome...

666
01:08:45,735 --> 01:08:48,203
The weather is awesome... '

667
01:08:48,604 --> 01:08:51,732
It's spreading magic all around.

668
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:53,870
The weather is awesome...

669
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:56,678
The weather is awesome...

670
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:56,933
Leave me! Let me go!

671
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:07,409
Leave me! No!

672
01:10:20,763 --> 01:10:23,357
Get off me! Stop!

673
01:10:27,303 --> 01:10:29,294
Stop! Get off me!

674
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:33,967
No!

675
01:10:44,921 --> 01:10:45,979
Leave me!

676
01:10:50,393 --> 01:10:51,451
No!

677
01:10:53,996 --> 01:10:55,258
No!

678
01:10:55,932 --> 01:10:56,990
No!

679
01:11:02,805 --> 01:11:03,863
No!

680
01:11:29,365 --> 01:11:32,027
Boys... sorry.

681
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:51,311
Some consequences are
worse than death.

682
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:53,912
He had tapped the old guy's line.

683
01:11:54,857 --> 01:11:59,590
He'd called from his number.
He's a clever criminal.

684
01:12:01,397 --> 01:12:02,455
Criminal...

685
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:07,332
Irfan, I want a list of
the police complaints...

686
01:12:07,403 --> 01:12:08,529
...l've lodged in the past 10 years.

687
01:12:09,338 --> 01:12:14,071
Okay. It seems like he's holding
onto an old grudge.

688
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:19,342
Try and remember who it can be.

689
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:30,354
I don't know him or why
he's doing all this.

690
01:12:31,961 --> 01:12:36,398
But once we trace him, I'll give
him a good reason to hate me.

691
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,558
I'll bring him down.

692
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,341
This is... I've...

693
01:14:32,457 --> 01:14:33,583
This is my house!

694
01:14:38,663 --> 01:14:40,494
Our old holiday home!

695
01:14:45,803 --> 01:14:48,294
You locked me in my own house?!

696
01:14:54,545 --> 01:14:57,207
I remember these steps...

697
01:15:00,785 --> 01:15:02,253
The kitchen was there...

698
01:15:06,225 --> 01:15:10,423
I loved this place! The
last time we were here...

699
01:15:12,584 --> 01:15:13,189
Wedding anniversary.

700
01:15:13,224 --> 01:15:14,714
It was my last holiday with dad.

701
01:15:17,094 --> 01:15:19,062
Your mom got this house
as divorce alimony.

702
01:15:21,665 --> 01:15:26,762
We never came here again, maybe
because dad loved this place.

703
01:15:28,672 --> 01:15:34,338
You sealed the windows, the doors...

704
01:15:37,047 --> 01:15:38,309
...closed it from there too.

705
01:15:40,684 --> 01:15:44,643
Very clever of you to keep me here.

706
01:15:46,624 --> 01:15:48,114
Who will look for me
in my own house?

707
01:15:51,896 --> 01:15:53,659
What a dump this place has become!

708
01:15:55,099 --> 01:15:56,157
Naturally. It was locked for years.

709
01:15:58,636 --> 01:15:59,728
How do you know so much?

710
01:16:01,705 --> 01:16:02,763
I was here.

711
01:16:31,335 --> 01:16:32,666
Hello, Mr. Soni!
- Hello!

712
01:16:32,736 --> 01:16:34,727
Happy anniversary.
- Thank you very much.

713
01:16:34,905 --> 01:16:36,395
Happy anniversary!
- Thank you.

714
01:16:36,941 --> 01:16:38,340
Kabir, come...

715
01:16:42,913 --> 01:16:43,971
Hey, let's go inside.

716
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,007
Mr. Raina is not to be seen.

717
01:16:46,817 --> 01:16:50,048
He'll be here any minute.

718
01:16:50,287 --> 01:16:51,345
Give me this one!

719
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:56,350
Check it this one!

720
01:16:59,863 --> 01:17:00,921
Give me this one!

721
01:17:03,701 --> 01:17:04,759
Check it this one!

722
01:17:05,436 --> 01:17:06,801
Say, give me this one!

723
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,314
Our eyes first met at
a local store.

724
01:17:19,383 --> 01:17:20,748
I said, yes baby!

725
01:17:21,819 --> 01:17:24,379
The girl asked will you marry me.

726
01:17:24,455 --> 01:17:25,945
I said, yes baby!

727
01:17:26,924 --> 01:17:29,392
Our eyes first met at
a local store.

728
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,950
I said, yes baby!

729
01:17:31,929 --> 01:17:34,727
The girl asked will you marry me.

730
01:17:34,798 --> 01:17:36,163
I said, yes baby!

731
01:17:36,834 --> 01:17:40,167
Come Sunday, we got engaged.

732
01:17:40,237 --> 01:17:42,797
Monday, we tied the knot.

733
01:17:42,873 --> 01:17:46,070
She said, will you
love me forever?

734
01:17:46,143 --> 01:17:47,804
I said, yes baby!

735
01:17:48,812 --> 01:17:51,076
Our eyes first met
at a local store.

736
01:17:51,148 --> 01:17:52,843
I said, yes baby!

737
01:17:53,817 --> 01:17:56,342
The girl asked will you marry me.

738
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:58,012
I said, yes baby!

739
01:17:58,422 --> 01:17:59,480
Oh no!

740
01:18:08,832 --> 01:18:11,426
Now whatever in the world
is the man to do?

741
01:18:11,502 --> 01:18:14,266
When you see a lovely girl
like the one I see in you.

742
01:18:19,076 --> 01:18:21,442
We were very happy!
- Really?

743
01:18:21,512 --> 01:18:24,106
And then came Tuesday!

744
01:18:24,181 --> 01:18:25,773
I returned home tired...

745
01:18:25,849 --> 01:18:29,307
...to see her sulking
on the terrace.

746
01:18:29,386 --> 01:18:31,854
I went up to her and asked...

747
01:18:31,922 --> 01:18:34,186
Darling, am I the reason
you're upset?

748
01:18:34,425 --> 01:18:36,859
Little did I know I was in a mess.

749
01:18:36,927 --> 01:18:39,862
I'd forgotten her birthday,
oh goodness!

750
01:18:42,866 --> 01:18:45,334
Come Wednesday I said,
sorry dear wife.

751
01:18:45,402 --> 01:18:47,870
Unmoved she said, sorry
won't suffice.

752
01:18:47,938 --> 01:18:50,805
Made me promise the
moon and the sky.

753
01:18:51,175 --> 01:18:52,938
And all I could say, yes baby!

754
01:18:53,877 --> 01:18:56,311
Our eyes first met
at a local store.

755
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:58,041
I said, yes baby!

756
01:18:58,882 --> 01:19:01,476
The girl asked will you marry me.

757
01:19:01,552 --> 01:19:02,985
I said, yes baby!

758
01:19:03,053 --> 01:19:04,111
Oh no!

759
01:19:19,436 --> 01:19:20,494
O you got me, baby!

760
01:19:20,571 --> 01:19:22,232
You got me baby, down
to the knees baby.

761
01:19:22,306 --> 01:19:24,171
I'm a label stuck on you.

762
01:19:24,575 --> 01:19:26,008
You got me baby, down
to the knees, baby.

763
01:19:26,076 --> 01:19:29,170
I'm a label stuck on you.

764
01:19:31,915 --> 01:19:34,406
Be it a Saturday or a Sunday...

765
01:19:34,485 --> 01:19:36,919
She nagged me all night, all day.

766
01:19:36,987 --> 01:19:39,512
Forever at her beck and call...

767
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:42,115
I became a slave to just
another pretty face.

768
01:19:42,192 --> 01:19:43,853
It's been years now...

769
01:19:43,927 --> 01:19:47,055
...since I've lost my peace of mind.

770
01:19:47,131 --> 01:19:49,531
She's made my life hell.

771
01:19:49,867 --> 01:19:52,927
But I bear it all with
a smiling face.

772
01:19:55,873 --> 01:19:57,966
It's a free country, they say.

773
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:03,604
But at home, the wives
have their way.

774
01:20:04,047 --> 01:20:05,878
Don't you all agree with me?

775
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,394
Those who are married
regret big time.

776
01:20:22,132 --> 01:20:24,532
We were kings then
now meek as mice.

777
01:20:27,104 --> 01:20:29,629
Life stretches long
like a chewing gum.

778
01:20:32,276 --> 01:20:34,972
No one can be happy with just one.

779
01:20:37,314 --> 01:20:40,010
Listen to me or you'll regret.

780
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:42,347
Never ever marry,
it'll be the end of your life.

781
01:20:42,453 --> 01:20:43,647
Absolutely!

782
01:20:45,022 --> 01:20:47,582
Never ever marry,
it'll be the end of your life.

783
01:20:47,658 --> 01:20:50,092
It'll be the end of your life.

784
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:52,654
It'll be the end of your life.

785
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:55,091
It'll be the end of your life.

786
01:20:55,165 --> 01:20:59,261
It'll be the end of your life.
It'll be the end of your life.

787
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:08,307
Raghu, be quick, buddy.

788
01:21:08,946 --> 01:21:10,004
Will you allow me to tie?

789
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:21,348
Kabir!

790
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:23,024
Come out!

791
01:21:25,395 --> 01:21:29,126
I've told you so many
times not to drive.

792
01:21:29,299 --> 01:21:32,962
Sister, you've always said that we're
not as privileged as the other kids.

793
01:21:33,036 --> 01:21:36,437
And so we have to learn
things twice as fast.

794
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,699
The car was parked in a wrong place.

795
01:21:38,976 --> 01:21:42,309
Why don't you ask Joseph to do it?

796
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:47,039
He's celebrating his birthday. Look!

797
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:48,445
He has no time to park cars.

798
01:21:50,621 --> 01:21:52,384
Kabir!

799
01:21:53,724 --> 01:21:56,158
How did it happen?

800
01:21:56,226 --> 01:21:57,284
I think you have a fracture.

801
01:21:58,395 --> 01:22:01,193
Don't worry. We'll take you
to a hospital immediately.

802
01:22:01,498 --> 01:22:06,993
The hospital is an hour away.
And our van broke down as well.

803
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:08,469
Kabir! Please do something.

804
01:22:08,539 --> 01:22:09,597
Please help me.

805
01:22:09,673 --> 01:22:12,267
Kabir, please help me.

806
01:22:12,342 --> 01:22:13,604
Yes, don't worry, we will...

807
01:22:13,677 --> 01:22:16,043
Joseph!

808
01:22:17,014 --> 01:22:18,072
Kabir.

809
01:22:22,019 --> 01:22:23,077
'Heaven. '

810
01:22:34,131 --> 01:22:38,124
Hey, what are you doing?
This is my dad's car.

811
01:22:38,302 --> 01:22:39,769
Oh no! Where did you come from?

812
01:22:40,037 --> 01:22:42,028
I'm taking this car. Please get out.

813
01:22:42,105 --> 01:22:45,040
No, this is my dad's car. Dad!

814
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:47,699
I need your car. I'll
return it in no time.

815
01:22:47,778 --> 01:22:50,110
No, this is my dad's car!

816
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:52,375
Sit if you want to.
I'm driving anyway.

817
01:22:53,383 --> 01:22:56,784
Hey, stop the car! - Papa...

818
01:22:57,321 --> 01:22:59,118
Hey, stop the car! - Papa...

819
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:01,419
Kabir, stop! Stop!

820
01:23:01,792 --> 01:23:05,455
Sir!

821
01:23:05,529 --> 01:23:08,054
Stop it, I say!

822
01:23:08,599 --> 01:23:09,725
Stop it!

823
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,131
Kabir! Stop it!

824
01:23:15,539 --> 01:23:17,063
Kabir!

825
01:23:48,105 --> 01:23:49,629
Vikrant, she's serious.

826
01:23:50,674 --> 01:23:53,302
She's suffered multiple injuries.

827
01:23:53,844 --> 01:23:55,471
She is bleeding internally.

828
01:23:57,581 --> 01:23:59,446
We're helpless for the next 24 hours.

829
01:24:01,652 --> 01:24:04,621
He was saying that Sonia may not...

830
01:24:05,656 --> 01:24:09,717
Excuse me, sir. We've
done the investigation.

831
01:24:10,827 --> 01:24:12,124
The boy is speaking the truth.

832
01:24:12,329 --> 01:24:15,196
His friend has hurt himself.
He's in the hospital right now.

833
01:24:15,799 --> 01:24:18,393
His leg has been seriously damaged
because of the delay.

834
01:24:20,871 --> 01:24:23,203
He didn't have any intentions
to kidnap your daughter.

835
01:24:23,807 --> 01:24:25,331
But for stealing your car...

836
01:24:26,843 --> 01:24:29,403
It's his first offence.
Maybe if the judge considers that...

837
01:24:29,479 --> 01:24:31,413
Stop. Come here.

838
01:24:39,656 --> 01:24:43,888
Look at her. That's
my daughter, Sonia.

839
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:49,161
The doctors say that only if she
makes it through the next 24 hours...

840
01:24:49,232 --> 01:24:53,293
...can they even think of saving her
life. But her chances are grim.

841
01:24:54,438 --> 01:24:57,168
This boy is responsible
for her condition.

842
01:25:01,445 --> 01:25:02,503
But sir...

843
01:25:02,579 --> 01:25:04,604
Shut up! And listen
to what I'm saying.

844
01:25:05,615 --> 01:25:09,847
Had she been your daughter,
you would've never taken his side.

845
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,182
But the truth is...

846
01:25:11,254 --> 01:25:16,851
The truth is that he kidnapped
my daughter in my own car!

847
01:25:17,561 --> 01:25:21,327
The truth is that
my daughter may die.

848
01:25:22,432 --> 01:25:25,560
My daughter means the world to me.

849
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:29,532
Look into his eyes, inspector.

850
01:25:30,607 --> 01:25:32,666
They're full of deceit.

851
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:38,739
He's a kidnapper, on his way
to commit graver crimes.

852
01:25:39,516 --> 01:25:41,950
I'll make sure he's never bailed out.

853
01:25:42,753 --> 01:25:49,420
My lawyers will watch like hawks
if anyone tries to take his side.

854
01:25:51,561 --> 01:25:53,358
He deserves to be put behind bars.

855
01:25:54,731 --> 01:25:57,962
He has committed a crime
and he is a criminal.

856
01:26:03,306 --> 01:26:06,469
Vikrant Raina pronounced me guilty
and that was the final verdict.

857
01:26:08,245 --> 01:26:09,837
Because of your father's complaint...

858
01:26:09,913 --> 01:26:11,312
...Sister Margaret was fired
from the orphanage.

859
01:26:13,316 --> 01:26:14,374
Our lives were ruined.

860
01:26:15,986 --> 01:26:18,978
And I spent seven years in prison.

861
01:26:19,256 --> 01:26:20,314
But...
- Were you ever asked...

862
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:22,915
...what actually happened that day?

863
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:29,756
I thought so. Who cares
about the truth?

864
01:26:31,835 --> 01:26:33,268
I was very serious.

865
01:26:34,571 --> 01:26:37,563
Dad's anger is justified.

866
01:26:39,009 --> 01:26:40,601
But I can tell them the truth now.

867
01:26:41,278 --> 01:26:44,338
Who cares what the truth is?

868
01:26:45,015 --> 01:26:48,348
A poor man's mistake means the
end of the road for him.

869
01:26:49,286 --> 01:26:51,550
He's thrown into prison
and expected to change.

870
01:26:53,757 --> 01:26:55,349
But that change never comes about.

871
01:26:56,293 --> 01:27:01,356
Instead, pain, frustration and rage
are all churned together inside you...

872
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:06,425
...to leave a kind of
emptiness within...

873
01:27:06,503 --> 01:27:12,965
...that is fuelled by rage.

874
01:27:15,345 --> 01:27:19,042
You've been through a lot.

875
01:27:21,051 --> 01:27:25,044
But aren't you overdoing
the punishment bit?

876
01:27:25,322 --> 01:27:26,414
What do you say to this?

877
01:27:27,057 --> 01:27:28,354
What do you say to this?

878
01:27:31,361 --> 01:27:34,558
My punishment for eating
before an older inmate.

879
01:27:34,798 --> 01:27:35,924
This... with the knife...

880
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:38,665
I was only 14 then. My
sentence got extended.

881
01:27:39,803 --> 01:27:41,395
So, wasn't that punishment overdone?

882
01:27:42,873 --> 01:27:46,502
Here's another.
I helped a deaf mute. My reward?

883
01:27:46,643 --> 01:27:47,940
Prize... overtime in jail...

884
01:27:48,511 --> 01:27:50,479
Got to serve some more time!

885
01:27:52,515 --> 01:27:55,416
These are very special! Bought
me two more years in prison.

886
01:27:55,819 --> 01:27:56,911
I owe them to a drunk jailer.

887
01:27:58,455 --> 01:28:01,891
He lied that I was trying to escape.

888
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:03,850
And you talk about me overdoing it?

889
01:28:03,927 --> 01:28:05,360
Stop it! Stop it, please!

890
01:28:09,366 --> 01:28:13,029
You can't even bear to look
at them. I've borne them!

891
01:28:14,671 --> 01:28:16,104
And all I ever wanted
was to save a friend.

892
01:28:16,773 --> 01:28:18,536
And now, your dad has to save you.

893
01:28:20,377 --> 01:28:22,436
Let's see how far he can go.

894
01:28:24,114 --> 01:28:25,376
Let's just wait and watch.

895
01:28:25,448 --> 01:28:26,847
Sir, there's an e-mail regarding
the police complaints.

896
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:28,441
Mr. Raina had lodged three
complaints against individuals.

897
01:28:28,585 --> 01:28:32,385
One... Rajan Chaudhary in
Mumbai, 1992. Aged 35.

898
01:28:33,056 --> 01:28:37,925
No, he's too old. This
kidnapper is young.

899
01:28:39,396 --> 01:28:43,423
Another, Kabir Devendra Sharma,
an orphan from Alibaug. Aged 14.

900
01:28:43,867 --> 01:28:46,062
And the third, Hiren Mehta, a stock
broker from Mumbai 1995.

901
01:28:46,136 --> 01:28:47,763
Aged 30 years.

902
01:28:47,837 --> 01:28:49,395
What was that name again?
- Hiren Mehta?

903
01:28:49,472 --> 01:28:50,598
The one before that.

904
01:28:50,907 --> 01:28:54,536
Kabir Sharma, an orphan from Alibaug.
- Kabir!

905
01:28:54,611 --> 01:28:56,943
Ran away from Mumbai...

906
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,571
...an orphan...

907
01:28:59,649 --> 01:29:01,412
...breaking the door...

908
01:29:01,484 --> 01:29:03,816
...breaking the shackles...

909
01:29:03,887 --> 01:29:06,788
...eighty... ninety...

910
01:29:06,856 --> 01:29:09,950
...Sister Margaret...

911
01:29:11,428 --> 01:29:13,157
That's it! That's it!

912
01:29:14,431 --> 01:29:19,164
Do you remember the day of the
party when Sonia was abducted?

913
01:29:19,903 --> 01:29:20,961
And he stole the car too?

914
01:29:22,105 --> 01:29:23,163
You mean the accident?
- Yes.

915
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,498
Of course, I remember.

916
01:29:25,909 --> 01:29:29,572
It's him. I'm sure Kabir
is the kidnapper.

917
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:32,175
All details on Kabir Sharma! Quick!
- Yes, sir!

918
01:29:32,449 --> 01:29:34,041
Are you sure? He was just a kid.

919
01:29:34,451 --> 01:29:41,516
Yes, all these clues point towards
him. It all adds up.

920
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:43,118
Kabir Sharma!

921
01:29:45,128 --> 01:29:46,186
Vikrant, phone.

922
01:29:46,463 --> 01:29:47,521
Vikrant, that must be him.

923
01:29:49,599 --> 01:29:51,533
Stop!
- What?

924
01:29:52,068 --> 01:29:53,865
Nobody should answer.
- But...

925
01:29:53,937 --> 01:29:55,131
Just don't pick up the phone.

926
01:29:55,205 --> 01:29:56,832
What are you saying?
- Don't pick up the phone!

927
01:30:09,219 --> 01:30:10,618
For how long?

928
01:30:11,821 --> 01:30:14,813
I don't know. I just
don't know, Mallika.

929
01:30:17,193 --> 01:30:19,491
All I know is that if we
don't take his call...

930
01:30:19,562 --> 01:30:23,225
...he'll be forced to do something
he has not planned before.

931
01:31:21,558 --> 01:31:22,684
That is the extension
number of Sonia's room.

932
01:32:27,824 --> 01:32:28,882
Oh no! Oh no!

933
01:35:38,414 --> 01:35:39,540
Nothing's going right.

934
01:35:41,884 --> 01:35:45,547
Then you'll make it right,
Vikrant. I trust you.

935
01:35:47,824 --> 01:35:49,121
So does Mallika.

936
01:35:54,831 --> 01:35:59,564
Mallika and I... how
did it all go wrong?

937
01:36:05,441 --> 01:36:12,904
Some things in life need to be said.

938
01:36:14,917 --> 01:36:21,152
You've always loved her. Only...
she's never heard you say it.

939
01:36:24,927 --> 01:36:30,923
Go and tell her that you love her.

940
01:36:31,934 --> 01:36:36,371
And that you need her. That's all
she has ever wanted to hear.

941
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:39,134
Where is she?

942
01:36:39,942 --> 01:36:43,571
Where she always goes
when she's upset.

943
01:36:45,214 --> 01:36:46,272
The temple?

944
01:36:55,057 --> 01:36:56,957
Take my wallet. But there's
no cash in it.

945
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,188
Do you ever think beyond money?

946
01:37:00,963 --> 01:37:02,021
Give me the wallet.

947
01:37:05,234 --> 01:37:06,292
Drive.

948
01:37:25,421 --> 01:37:27,548
Soni!

949
01:37:29,392 --> 01:37:30,450
Are you alright?

950
01:37:32,995 --> 01:37:35,293
Those scars... how dare he hurt you!

951
01:37:41,537 --> 01:37:42,595
You've become so...

952
01:37:44,273 --> 01:37:47,071
I saw your photos.
Yet I can't believe my eyes!

953
01:37:48,277 --> 01:37:49,335
You're so grown-up.

954
01:37:52,949 --> 01:37:54,007
What?

955
01:37:55,017 --> 01:37:57,611
I'm looking good?

956
01:38:01,023 --> 01:38:02,081
Thanks!

957
01:38:04,427 --> 01:38:07,123
What? I don't understand.

958
01:38:08,498 --> 01:38:12,264
Mom? You mean, how's mom?

959
01:38:15,471 --> 01:38:18,702
She's tense. She misses you a lot.

960
01:38:23,312 --> 01:38:27,442
You miss her too? I'll tell her that.

961
01:38:29,151 --> 01:38:34,646
No, you tell her that, after
all this is over...

962
01:38:35,324 --> 01:38:37,053
I'll get you out of this, I promise.

963
01:38:44,066 --> 01:38:48,059
I didn't miss, Raina.
I was aiming for the fruits.

964
01:38:53,075 --> 01:38:58,012
But if I fire 100 rounds...

965
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:03,017
...it's possible that
I miss the mark...

966
01:39:03,085 --> 01:39:09,081
...and a stray bullet hits Sonia.

967
01:39:11,561 --> 01:39:12,755
It may strike her face...

968
01:39:15,097 --> 01:39:16,155
Can we kill her?

969
01:39:19,535 --> 01:39:20,593
Let's see...

970
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:25,369
No! Stop it! Don't do it!

971
01:39:26,676 --> 01:39:27,734
Why not?

972
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:29,573
After what happened today,
why the hell not?

973
01:39:29,712 --> 01:39:34,046
Listen, keep Sonia out of this.
This is between you and me.

974
01:39:34,116 --> 01:39:35,174
And I'm right here!

975
01:39:35,384 --> 01:39:36,715
Shoot me instead.

976
01:39:39,055 --> 01:39:45,426
I'd told! Only
two players. You and me.

977
01:39:46,395 --> 01:39:48,386
I'd told you the rules.

978
01:39:49,565 --> 01:39:51,328
No more, I promise.

979
01:39:51,634 --> 01:39:53,465
From now on, I'll do as you say.

980
01:39:56,205 --> 01:39:57,433
I find that very hard to believe.

981
01:39:59,408 --> 01:40:01,308
I'm seeing my daughter
after eight years.

982
01:40:03,145 --> 01:40:05,136
I will do anything to see her again.

983
01:40:05,548 --> 01:40:09,143
I know. That's precisely why
I've brought you here.

984
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:15,819
Now listen to me carefully,
get rid of your security man.

985
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:19,685
I'll do that, I promise. Irfan
won't work on the case anymore.

986
01:40:21,697 --> 01:40:25,599
Now let's get back to the game.

987
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:28,728
This is your phone.

988
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,466
Your instructions for the
next clue are on this.

989
01:41:09,645 --> 01:41:10,703
What happened, Vikrant?

990
01:41:11,547 --> 01:41:13,515
I followed your signal
and found this wallet.

991
01:41:13,582 --> 01:41:17,143
Did Kabir... - Irfan! You
need to get off this case.

992
01:41:17,687 --> 01:41:19,348
What? But why?

993
01:41:20,222 --> 01:41:22,349
Kabir made him meet Sonia today.

994
01:41:23,492 --> 01:41:25,153
That means he learned about
the tracking device.

995
01:41:25,227 --> 01:41:26,285
I'll sort him out.

996
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:32,530
No, you won't. He knows about you.

997
01:41:33,569 --> 01:41:36,629
He wants you off. That's
his new demand.

998
01:41:36,706 --> 01:41:39,573
That's because he knows he doesn't
stand a chance against me.

999
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:44,578
Why don't you understand?
You need me.

1000
01:41:46,782 --> 01:41:50,775
He's outsmarted me twice but
I won't let him win so easily.

1001
01:41:50,853 --> 01:41:54,414
This is not about winning!
This is about Sonia.

1002
01:41:55,191 --> 01:41:56,920
Don't make it a personal matter.

1003
01:41:59,695 --> 01:42:03,495
I can't do much if you've
already made up your mind.

1004
01:42:04,533 --> 01:42:07,661
But you're making a big mistake.

1005
01:42:09,705 --> 01:42:10,933
My team will remain here.

1006
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:13,940
Just for your safety. Take care.

1007
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:26,510
You all stay put. And
keep me in the loop.

1008
01:42:32,762 --> 01:42:33,820
What is this?

1009
01:42:34,563 --> 01:42:37,896
To get my next clue, I'll have to
spring a prisoner from Devapur jail.

1010
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:10,526
Tell me, madam.
- I'm a human right's activist.

1011
01:43:10,599 --> 01:43:13,329
I need to meet the jail
superintendent immediately.

1012
01:43:51,874 --> 01:43:56,811
Please sit. What's the matter?

1013
01:44:04,854 --> 01:44:06,754
There are complaints...

1014
01:44:06,822 --> 01:44:09,757
...about extreme abuse by prison
authorities to inmates.

1015
01:44:15,931 --> 01:44:18,991
Now, you're going to tell
us how to do our jobs?

1016
01:44:24,673 --> 01:44:25,731
Raghu...

1017
01:44:28,477 --> 01:44:31,412
Here... here...

1018
01:44:34,884 --> 01:44:35,942
Where are you going?

1019
01:44:54,937 --> 01:44:57,565
I'm here for an inspection.
I need to talk to the prisoners.

1020
01:44:59,909 --> 01:45:00,967
At this hour?

1021
01:45:01,043 --> 01:45:02,101
It's a surprise check.

1022
01:45:06,949 --> 01:45:08,712
What happened? Shinde!

1023
01:45:12,721 --> 01:45:14,689
Hurry up!

1024
01:45:15,925 --> 01:45:16,983
Shinde!
- Yes, sir.

1025
01:45:17,059 --> 01:45:18,117
What happened?

1026
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:19,984
This is my chance!

1027
01:45:23,599 --> 01:45:25,123
Take a roll call of the prisoners.
- Yes, sir.

1028
01:45:25,901 --> 01:45:29,393
This is my chance!

1029
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:32,798
Hurry!

1030
01:45:43,752 --> 01:45:44,810
It's opened!

1031
01:45:50,926 --> 01:45:51,984
What are you doing?

1032
01:45:59,768 --> 01:46:00,826
No chance!

1033
01:46:09,511 --> 01:46:10,569
It's there!

1034
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:13,042
I have written permission.
- Please come tomorrow morning.

1035
01:46:13,115 --> 01:46:14,173
Please go now.

1036
01:46:14,516 --> 01:46:17,508
I was told you would help me escape.

1037
01:46:18,654 --> 01:46:19,951
But you've gone and
locked yourself in!

1038
01:46:20,522 --> 01:46:21,580
Now, no chance!

1039
01:46:21,657 --> 01:46:23,454
We will escape.

1040
01:46:23,792 --> 01:46:26,192
Right. Do you even have a plan?

1041
01:46:26,795 --> 01:46:28,194
Do you see that white van?

1042
01:46:29,999 --> 01:46:31,057
We're going in that.

1043
01:46:32,001 --> 01:46:33,059
Who will drive the van?

1044
01:46:33,969 --> 01:46:35,027
That beautiful
lady?

1045
01:46:37,906 --> 01:46:38,964
She's my wife.

1046
01:46:39,041 --> 01:46:42,477
She's walking towards the van.
She's turned the ignition on...

1047
01:46:42,544 --> 01:46:47,174
...and off she goes!

1048
01:46:49,818 --> 01:46:51,115
Now, no chance!

1049
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:54,084
Is the roll call over?
- Yes.

1050
01:47:00,562 --> 01:47:01,756
Wow! You swapped the lock earlier.

1051
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:03,127
There's still a chance...

1052
01:47:24,119 --> 01:47:28,249
You are thinking, right?

1053
01:47:30,092 --> 01:47:31,525
I hope you're thinking
about your next move.

1054
01:47:32,528 --> 01:47:35,793
Come dawn, we'll have
no chance of escape!

1055
01:47:41,136 --> 01:47:42,535
Is that the kitchen?
- Yes.

1056
01:48:22,911 --> 01:48:26,074
Shinde... come fast... come fast...
all of you...

1057
01:48:32,154 --> 01:48:34,315
Hello... I am calling from Devapur
jail. A fire has broken out here.

1058
01:49:20,102 --> 01:49:21,160
Come fast!

1059
01:49:44,993 --> 01:49:46,119
Where's my daughter?

1060
01:49:46,662 --> 01:49:49,130
Tell me. I'll give you
anything you want.

1061
01:49:50,232 --> 01:49:55,727
I don't know. And even if I did,
I would never tell you. No chance!

1062
01:49:56,738 --> 01:50:02,370
I was the kid Kabir was trying
to save when he stole your car.

1063
01:50:03,011 --> 01:50:04,069
So that was you?

1064
01:50:04,146 --> 01:50:07,741
Yes. In my guilt, I tried to spring
him from prison and was jailed.

1065
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:10,183
You have everything in this world.

1066
01:50:11,286 --> 01:50:15,689
But do have a single friend
who can go to jail for you?

1067
01:50:15,757 --> 01:50:17,384
Do you have?

1068
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:23,755
My daughter is all I have.
I just want my daughter. That's all.

1069
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,431
Maybe this will help.

1070
01:50:33,775 --> 01:50:35,299
'Twinkle twinkle little star... '

1071
01:50:35,377 --> 01:50:38,312
'Heaven's near, so why fear? '

1072
01:50:39,248 --> 01:50:40,875
'Twinkle twinkle little star... '

1073
01:50:41,316 --> 01:50:44,285
'Fear, as the devil too dwells here. '

1074
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:53,794
Thanks for rescuing me.

1075
01:51:14,483 --> 01:51:15,950
Limping all the way home?

1076
01:51:16,018 --> 01:51:17,815
Couldn't you have come sooner?

1077
01:51:26,161 --> 01:51:27,753
Raghu, wait right here.

1078
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:30,762
A bus leaves for Indore
in three hours from now.

1079
01:51:30,966 --> 01:51:33,298
Get on that bus and disappear.

1080
01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:36,762
Don't come back.

1081
01:51:37,506 --> 01:51:38,768
Even if you hear something about me.

1082
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:43,300
Don't talk rubbish! Whatever
will happen to you?

1083
01:51:44,513 --> 01:51:45,775
I'm going to hell...

1084
01:51:47,849 --> 01:51:49,783
...to await your arrival.
- No chance!

1085
01:51:53,855 --> 01:52:01,125
Kabir, let it go. Let her go.

1086
01:52:04,933 --> 01:52:05,991
You should go.

1087
01:52:07,336 --> 01:52:09,531
Bye!

1088
01:52:15,477 --> 01:52:16,535
You should leave.

1089
01:52:46,975 --> 01:52:48,033
How much, sir?

1090
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:49,168
Fill up the tank.

1091
01:52:59,388 --> 01:53:02,846
Your game's up.
Now you're a dead man.

1092
01:53:20,409 --> 01:53:21,467
Don't move.

1093
01:53:23,945 --> 01:53:25,003
Or I'll burn you.

1094
01:53:42,964 --> 01:53:44,022
Vikrant, I'd almost caught him...

1095
01:53:44,099 --> 01:53:48,092
Shut up! I was following him
for the past two hours.

1096
01:53:48,637 --> 01:53:52,971
I'd have easily found Sonia
had it not been for you.

1097
01:53:54,109 --> 01:53:57,442
I'd told you earlier,
don't make it personal.

1098
01:53:58,313 --> 01:53:59,905
Just stay away, Irfan!

1099
01:53:59,981 --> 01:54:01,039
Stay away.

1100
01:57:22,450 --> 01:57:25,578
Eer and Beer live together
at the sea.

1101
01:57:28,189 --> 01:57:30,123
After 90, you stooped further low.

1102
01:57:31,726 --> 01:57:34,126
Heaven's near.

1103
01:57:34,262 --> 01:57:36,196
The Devil too dwells here.

1104
01:57:44,205 --> 01:57:47,402
After 90 means 1995...

1105
01:57:48,343 --> 01:57:50,607
There's a sea near Alibaug...

1106
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:53,338
He's an orphan...

1107
01:57:54,749 --> 01:57:58,810
Sonia is with him in 'Swarg',
our holiday home!

1108
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:00,278
Swarg, Mallika...

1109
01:58:00,889 --> 01:58:03,153
He has kept Sonia in our own house!

1110
01:58:30,185 --> 01:58:31,243
On no!

1111
01:58:31,319 --> 01:58:33,514
No! I'm still here.

1112
01:58:34,789 --> 01:58:38,919
Surprised? Had I escaped,
you would've bled to death.

1113
01:58:41,329 --> 01:58:42,796
That's the difference
between you and me.

1114
01:58:56,478 --> 01:58:57,604
These won't help.

1115
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:01,740
Shut up! Now listen carefully...

1116
01:59:03,685 --> 01:59:04,743
Pick up the receiver.

1117
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:07,219
Call my dad.

1118
01:59:12,293 --> 01:59:15,956
Ask him to come here and
take me home.

1119
01:59:17,766 --> 01:59:19,495
This is how I want it to end.

1120
01:59:20,435 --> 01:59:22,630
No, it's not over.

1121
01:59:23,238 --> 01:59:26,230
Yes, it is. Forget everything.

1122
01:59:26,975 --> 01:59:28,237
We too will forget everything.

1123
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:33,303
No police, no complaints. Nothing.

1124
01:59:34,983 --> 01:59:37,850
Now, you'll do the right thing.

1125
01:59:39,521 --> 01:59:42,922
Call my dad right now!

1126
02:00:03,278 --> 02:00:06,008
Sonia is around somewhere.
I can feel it.

1127
02:00:59,067 --> 02:01:03,868
Quiet! I won't shoot you,
I'll shoot him.

1128
02:01:21,689 --> 02:01:22,747
I'm sorry.

1129
02:01:37,872 --> 02:01:38,930
Where's Sonia?

1130
02:01:39,007 --> 02:01:44,707
She's alive and so am I.
You tried your best to kill me.

1131
02:01:45,046 --> 02:01:47,742
I released Irfan as per your demands.

1132
02:01:48,583 --> 02:01:50,107
Trust me, I'm not involved.

1133
02:01:50,985 --> 02:01:56,389
Listen, we've solved the clues and
found the location. Fair and square.

1134
02:01:57,492 --> 02:01:59,460
Now, return our daughter to us.

1135
02:02:00,461 --> 02:02:01,519
It's not so simple, Raina.

1136
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:04,724
I'll decide what's fair
and what's not.

1137
02:02:06,601 --> 02:02:08,865
You'll have to do one
last thing to save her.

1138
02:02:10,071 --> 02:02:11,129
What's that?

1139
02:02:13,508 --> 02:02:14,566
Murder!

1140
02:02:15,944 --> 02:02:20,142
31 st night is here!

1141
02:02:39,567 --> 02:02:40,625
Welcome to the rave!

1142
02:02:41,102 --> 02:02:43,161
A world far from reality.

1143
02:02:43,972 --> 02:02:46,805
Everyone's alive in this place,
but are they really?

1144
02:02:48,843 --> 02:02:52,108
Time ceases to exist once
you step into this place.

1145
02:02:53,014 --> 02:02:55,005
You're going to live
this world tonight.

1146
02:02:56,184 --> 02:02:59,779
A world caught between light
and darkness, my world.

1147
02:03:01,022 --> 02:03:02,080
Turn right.

1148
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:06,021
There are two bars. Go to
the one on the far end.

1149
02:03:20,008 --> 02:03:21,202
I'm there. Now what?

1150
02:03:21,809 --> 02:03:24,175
What do you do at a bar?
Order a drink!

1151
02:03:25,646 --> 02:03:26,704
Excuse me.
- Yes?

1152
02:03:26,781 --> 02:03:28,476
A glass of water please.
- Sure.

1153
02:03:30,485 --> 02:03:31,543
You forgot the ice.

1154
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:33,585
Thanks! No ice for me.

1155
02:03:33,821 --> 02:03:36,483
Take some ice and take it yourself.

1156
02:03:36,991 --> 02:03:41,985
I've left you a New year's
gift in the ice-box.

1157
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:49,035
Excuse me? Do you need
something, dude?

1158
02:03:49,737 --> 02:03:51,170
No, thanks buddy.
- Cheers!

1159
02:04:00,014 --> 02:04:01,504
Why are you making me kill someone?

1160
02:04:02,116 --> 02:04:04,243
Who's he and what's my
connection with him?

1161
02:04:04,986 --> 02:04:07,216
That's not important. Keep moving.

1162
02:04:08,256 --> 02:04:09,518
There's definitely a connection...

1163
02:04:09,590 --> 02:04:13,754
...considering all that
you've made me do so far.

1164
02:04:14,262 --> 02:04:15,627
First, It was sister Margaret.

1165
02:04:15,797 --> 02:04:17,526
She was your matron who got fired...

1166
02:04:17,598 --> 02:04:21,534
...from the orphanage
after you were jailed.

1167
02:04:21,869 --> 02:04:26,806
Then you made me steal and donated
that money to the same orphanage.

1168
02:04:26,941 --> 02:04:27,999
Well researched.

1169
02:04:28,142 --> 02:04:33,045
Then you made me spring
Raghu from prison.

1170
02:04:33,648 --> 02:04:34,876
And you took the credit!

1171
02:04:35,616 --> 02:04:36,742
Stop!
- What?

1172
02:04:37,552 --> 02:04:39,247
Your target's here. Turn left.

1173
02:04:40,988 --> 02:04:42,546
Do you see a man in blue paint?

1174
02:04:46,627 --> 02:04:47,685
Yes...

1175
02:04:47,762 --> 02:04:49,286
Look to his left.

1176
02:04:50,131 --> 02:04:53,100
There's a man in a butterfly jacket.
He has a ponytail. He's it.

1177
02:04:54,635 --> 02:04:55,693
I see him.

1178
02:04:55,770 --> 02:04:57,829
Stay behind him.
By the way, you're right.

1179
02:04:59,307 --> 02:05:02,834
There is a connection.
He knows you, be careful.

1180
02:05:04,312 --> 02:05:05,574
Make sure he doesn't see you.

1181
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:07,138
Who is he?

1182
02:05:07,215 --> 02:05:08,307
The last character of this story.

1183
02:05:08,916 --> 02:05:11,111
The story will end with him.

1184
02:05:11,786 --> 02:05:13,253
You must shoot him at
exactly 12 midnight.

1185
02:05:13,855 --> 02:05:15,322
Not even one minute later than 12!

1186
02:05:56,364 --> 02:05:58,332
Go and stand in the middle
of the dance floor...

1187
02:05:58,766 --> 02:06:00,028
...never removing your gaze from him.

1188
02:06:14,382 --> 02:06:15,644
Remove your gun.

1189
02:06:25,359 --> 02:06:28,795
A bullet from your gun
will set Sonia free.

1190
02:06:55,790 --> 02:06:57,121
The countdown has begun, Raina.

1191
02:06:57,925 --> 02:07:05,331
20, 19, 18, 17...

1192
02:07:05,766 --> 02:07:08,098
I can't.
- You can. You have to.

1193
02:07:08,202 --> 02:07:10,864
I can't! I can't!

1194
02:07:11,138 --> 02:07:13,698
He's not worth it.
You have to kill him!

1195
02:07:14,141 --> 02:07:15,199
No!

1196
02:07:15,276 --> 02:07:16,971
Choose. Him or your daughter?

1197
02:07:17,378 --> 02:07:20,142
She is your daughter, Raina!
This man or Sonia!

1198
02:07:20,815 --> 02:07:22,282
Come on, Raina!
Just pull the trigger.

1199
02:07:22,717 --> 02:07:25,185
Choose. Sonia alive or Sonia dead?

1200
02:07:25,386 --> 02:07:27,877
Sonia alive or Sonia dead?

1201
02:07:28,456 --> 02:07:31,087
Sonia dead!

1202
02:07:34,795 --> 02:07:42,133
Happy New Year!

1203
02:08:40,227 --> 02:08:41,285
Sorry.

1204
02:08:59,246 --> 02:09:00,270
'I'm sorry. '

1205
02:09:01,816 --> 02:09:03,340
Asking for forgiveness, are you?

1206
02:09:06,821 --> 02:09:07,879
Forgiveness for committing a murder?

1207
02:09:08,823 --> 02:09:11,553
Or for killing the one person
who could've led you to Sonia?

1208
02:09:15,062 --> 02:09:19,829
Years ago, a kid too wanted to say
'sorry' to you at the hospital.

1209
02:09:21,502 --> 02:09:25,563
'I'm sorry. ' But you never
gave him that chance.

1210
02:09:27,908 --> 02:09:32,345
And ever since, his heart was filled
with hatred. No room for forgiveness.

1211
02:09:42,857 --> 02:09:47,419
Once there was a boy, who took off
in a car without permission.

1212
02:09:49,196 --> 02:09:50,424
He was accused of kidnapping...

1213
02:09:51,866 --> 02:09:53,857
...and was labeled a criminal.

1214
02:09:55,870 --> 02:10:01,604
Today, there's a man who has caused
accidents, destroyed property...

1215
02:10:03,144 --> 02:10:08,980
...robbed people helped a prisoner
escape and finally...

1216
02:10:10,351 --> 02:10:11,875
He has committed a murder.

1217
02:10:11,952 --> 02:10:13,886
What does that make you...

1218
02:10:13,954 --> 02:10:18,118
...if stealing a car
made me a criminal?

1219
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:31,429
He was helpless. He was only trying
to save my daughter's life.

1220
02:10:34,975 --> 02:10:36,567
The boy too was trying
to save his friend.

1221
02:10:38,479 --> 02:10:41,642
If I was thrown into jail for that...

1222
02:10:43,117 --> 02:10:44,277
What punishment do you deserve?

1223
02:10:46,654 --> 02:10:48,918
There can be no greater
punishment than...

1224
02:10:48,989 --> 02:10:51,184
...what I've gone through
in the past seven days.

1225
02:10:55,229 --> 02:10:57,356
The thought of killing
an innocent person...

1226
02:11:00,100 --> 02:11:02,398
Or knowing that I may never
see my daughter again...

1227
02:11:04,338 --> 02:11:05,669
Does anything get worse than that?

1228
02:11:07,675 --> 02:11:11,941
To see tears in my wife's eyes,
each time I turn to look at her...

1229
02:11:12,012 --> 02:11:17,143
Is there a greater punishment
than that?

1230
02:11:19,153 --> 02:11:22,680
My wealth and power are of no use.

1231
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:32,258
But now, I understand what
you've gone through.

1232
02:11:34,535 --> 02:11:37,436
You were innocent. I was wrong.

1233
02:11:39,974 --> 02:11:41,498
Your hatred is justified.

1234
02:11:43,143 --> 02:11:47,341
It is justified when it's towards
me, not towards Sonia.

1235
02:11:55,990 --> 02:11:59,118
I don't hate you, Mr. Raina.
Not anymore.

1236
02:12:01,061 --> 02:12:04,656
You've shot dead that boy.

1237
02:12:07,067 --> 02:12:10,730
Standing before you is a
man freed from his past.

1238
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:16,733
The man who sent you to prison...
He too no longer exists.

1239
02:12:19,079 --> 02:12:23,015
Please forgive me for
what I did to you.

1240
02:12:27,087 --> 02:12:30,022
We can't change the past...

1241
02:12:30,090 --> 02:12:37,258
...but we can definitely change
the present and the future.

1242
02:12:41,402 --> 02:12:42,460
Kabir?

1243
02:14:38,252 --> 02:14:41,847
Soni! Soni! Soni!

1244
02:14:45,392 --> 02:14:50,830
Papa! Papa! Papa!

1245
02:14:53,167 --> 02:14:55,397
I've missed you. - Papa.

1246
02:15:42,216 --> 02:15:43,547
What do you think, Soni?
Who's better?

1247
02:15:43,617 --> 02:15:45,744
Well...
- Hey, that's not fair!

1248
02:15:47,488 --> 02:15:49,217
Soni! Tell me, who's better?

1249
02:15:51,759 --> 02:15:52,817
Come on!

1250
02:15:54,228 --> 02:15:56,219
Both of you were mind-blowing!

1251
02:15:57,698 --> 02:16:04,536
Actually, you're the coolest couple
and the world's best parents!

1252
02:16:08,308 --> 02:16:13,245
I'm really... I...

1253
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:18,545
Sorry, I'll be back. Excuse me.

1254
02:16:23,323 --> 02:16:24,381
Don't worry.

1255
02:16:28,796 --> 02:16:29,854
Hey you!

1256
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:37,728
Kabir...

1257
02:16:45,279 --> 02:16:50,649
I'm working with a software
company. Security systems.

1258
02:16:53,287 --> 02:16:56,654
That's good. Actually,
it's quite cool.

1259
02:17:01,829 --> 02:17:07,028
I wanted to say sorry
for what I did.

1260
02:17:09,536 --> 02:17:10,594
You didn't deserve it.

1261
02:17:12,306 --> 02:17:15,036
So, I'm sorry.

1262
02:17:19,813 --> 02:17:24,045
It's because of you, my
parents are together.

1263
02:17:26,653 --> 02:17:27,711
So, I guess we're quits.

1264
02:17:31,792 --> 02:17:37,697
Okay. Bye. I'll leave.

1265
02:17:39,466 --> 02:17:40,524
Kabir...

1266
02:17:45,873 --> 02:17:47,340
I wish you all the
very best in life.

1267
02:17:49,910 --> 02:17:54,074
You deserve all the happiness.

1268
02:17:56,083 --> 02:18:00,076
Thank you, Soni. Have a good life.

1269
02:18:03,624 --> 02:18:10,996
Just one thing. Stay close to the
shore the next time you go swimming.

1270
02:18:16,470 --> 02:18:18,836
So how many boy friends do you have?
- Let me guess.

1271
02:18:18,906 --> 02:18:21,568
Dad, don't listen to mom.
- Let me tell him.

1272
02:18:36,523 --> 02:18:40,926
Get evaded...

1273
02:18:58,812 --> 02:19:04,409
In my dreams...

1274
02:19:06,153 --> 02:19:12,023
...it becomes the sky...

1275
02:19:13,560 --> 02:19:20,989
...this land...

1276
02:19:21,068 --> 02:19:28,099
...it becomes the sky... this land...

1277
02:19:28,175 --> 02:19:33,909
Listen to it, this is my tale...

1278
02:19:35,749 --> 02:19:43,849
Get evaded...

1279
02:19:50,197 --> 02:19:57,194
Separated me from happiness...

1280
02:19:57,637 --> 02:20:04,475
...gave me tears...

1281
02:20:05,045 --> 02:20:12,474
In the darkness of sorrows,
my dreams shattered.

1282
02:20:12,552 --> 02:20:19,890
The dreams I had...

1283
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:27,489
Get evaded...

1284
02:20:27,567 --> 02:20:35,770
This land... and become the sky...

1285
02:20:41,848 --> 02:20:48,845
I treaded your golden path...

1286
02:20:49,523 --> 02:20:56,258
...becoming your shadow with thorns.

1287
02:20:56,930 --> 02:21:03,529
In the darkness of sorrows,
my dreams shattered.

1288
02:21:04,204 --> 02:21:11,042
My dreams are behind the bars.

1289
02:21:11,912 --> 02:21:19,284
Get evaded... this land...

1290
02:21:19,553 --> 02:21:26,618
Get evaded... become the sky...

1291
02:21:26,693 --> 02:21:32,563
Listen to it...

1292
02:21:33,967 --> 02:21:40,304
...this is my tale...

1293
02:21:41,575 --> 02:21:45,136
Get evaded...
