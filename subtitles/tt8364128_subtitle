1
00:01:57,604 --> 00:02:01,649
'There are certain questions
that children ask their parents..'

2
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,779
'..and so do you.'

3
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,863
'Mother, where is the socks?
Where is the soap?'

4
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:08,439
'I am not finding the towel.
Where is it?'

5
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:11,291
'What about my shirt? I had kept
my pant right here. Where is it?'

6
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:13,527
'What about my watch?
The phone charger?'

7
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:15,126
'Where are the headphones?'

8
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:16,548
'Mom, where are the keys to the bike?'

9
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:19,419
What about my lunch box?
Where is the remote control of the TV?

10
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,629
'Where is my phone?
Where's my wallet?'

11
00:02:21,812 --> 00:02:23,158
'Where is the pen and where's the paper?'

12
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,037
'Where is my spectacles, mom?
Oh, my God.'

13
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:30,090
'We would've asked several
such questions to our mothers..'

14
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,448
'..but we ask only one
question to our fathers.'

15
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:35,005
'Father, where is mother?'

16
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,726
'Though we talk harshly to her,
she responds very politely.'

17
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:43,692
'Mom, make 'Dosa' not 'Idli'.'

18
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:46,652
'Don't make 'Puri' make 'Chapati'.'

19
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,833
'Don't make chutney make curry.'

20
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,268
'Don't make mutton.'

21
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:52,482
'My friends are coming
home make chicken.'

22
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:55,550
'Don't make tea make filter coffee.'

23
00:02:55,982 --> 00:03:02,260
'My mother makes everything
I ask for selflessly.'

24
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:04,637
'My mother is a sweeper, cleaner..'

25
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,836
'...keeper, chef, waiter and teacher.'

26
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:10,594
'My mother is an organiser,
decorator..'

27
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:13,707
'..story teller, singer, actor
and an entrepreneur.'

28
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:17,253
'My mother is a bargainer,
treasurer, financial advisor..'

29
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:19,299
'..supporter and motivator.'

30
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:22,559
'She reminds me when
I forget to take my things.'

31
00:03:22,644 --> 00:03:25,481
'We need our mother for everything.'

32
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:28,712
'It takes a moment to be a father..'

33
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:32,309
'..but it takes a lifetime to be a mother.'

34
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,848
'This is our small tribute
to all the mothers.'

35
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,156
'Mom, I love you.'

36
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:53,435
Welcome to India, sir.

37
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:55,105
Welcome, sir.
- Thank you.

38
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,485
Welcome, sir.
- Thank you.

39
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:18,801
Mark, the consignment
should be here shortly.

40
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:20,634
Yes. Hold on a second.

41
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:21,985
I'll call you back.

42
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:24,785
Mom.
- Did you eat your food, Siddu?

43
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:27,187
Yes, mom. I ate food in the flight.

44
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:29,410
Okay. Put the driver on line.

45
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:34,461
Mom, he very well know
how much you care for me.

46
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:37,308
When I ask him to drive
the car speedily..

47
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:40,783
..he refuses to go above 60 speed.

48
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:43,874
Okay. Go home and rest.

49
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,790
Never mind,
I will come straight to the program, mom.

50
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,845
Okay, son.
- Okay, mom.

51
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:03,864
Friends, greetings to everyone
from Annapoorneshwari Group of Companies.

52
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,452
Now, I request
Ms. Annapoorneshwari Shivkumar...

53
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:06,866
..the managing director of the company..

54
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:10,290
..to come here and speak a few words.

55
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:15,682
Greetings.

56
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:18,192
Sit down.
- Okay.

57
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:19,959
Please come.

58
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:22,599
Greetings.

59
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:26,073
You must be wondering why
I have summoned all of you here.

60
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:29,628
Generally, such things
should be discussed in the office..

61
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:32,165
..or in the presence
of a lawyer or an auditor..

62
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,792
..but I will be glad only
if I do this thing at your presence.

63
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:41,888
As all of you that my son Siddu,
Siddharth..

64
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,475
..had been to America for education.

65
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,121
He has come back completing his studies.

66
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:51,628
Now, I am giving the
responsibility of looking after you..

67
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:54,621
..and Annapoorneshwari
Group of Companies to my son.

68
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:55,896
Come, Siddu.

69
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:08,647
Greetings, sir.

70
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:13,273
Marappa, I heard that the program
was quite grand. - Yes.

71
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:17,415
Someone said the garment
business is doing well.

72
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:19,065
Yes, sir.

73
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:21,054
Your younger brother's wife..

74
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,981
..has handed her responsibility that she
has been fulfilling for years to her son.

75
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:31,627
Moreover, the company is giving
16 percent bonus to the employees.

76
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,251
What for?

77
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:35,795
Because the company
has made good profit this year.

78
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,949
That's why...
- She should be beaten with slipper.

79
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,650
If the company suffered loss
in the coming year, who will bear it?

80
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:42,329
Ask her if she realises that.

81
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,213
The workers are paid for their work.

82
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:49,040
Don't we elders mean anything to her?
- Please come inside.

83
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:50,588
Leave me.
- Go away.

84
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:53,097
She might've toiled hard..

85
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:56,202
..but it was my brother who
started the factory. - Okay, come.

86
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,048
Ask her if she is out of her mind?
If she gives bonus to her employees..

87
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:03,191
..even my employees will
demand for bonus too.

88
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,720
Sleep for a while.

89
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:07,173
Darn it.
- I am married to you for years..

90
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:09,876
..I know how to calm you down.

91
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,671
Do it again.

92
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,464
Marappa.
- Yes.

93
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:28,191
Who has stopped the vehicle in the
middle of the road? - I don't know, sir.

94
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:39,272
Who are you?

95
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:40,743
Move!

96
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:42,924
Move inside!
- Let go!

97
00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:00,125
Take the phone.
I want 10 crores in 10 minutes.

98
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,393
Call anyone you want. Take it.

99
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:04,985
Is he mad?

100
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:07,243
He is talking rubbish.

101
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:11,840
After denominations
of 500 and 1000 was banned

102
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:18,338
the Prime Minister went on a rally.
What do I do?

103
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:24,211
So I always deposit
Rs. 10 in the bank.

104
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,335
Even that was banned.

105
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:38,722
I don't want to know your past.

106
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:41,406
Don't think only you
have been kidnapped..

107
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,551
..I have sent my boys to your house..

108
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,187
..listen to this.

109
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,831
Some goons have come home.

110
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:52,411
If you give 10 crores,
I will spare your wife alive.

111
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:55,934
Otherwise... Here, tell her.
- Dear, where are you?

112
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:58,515
Dear, where are you?
- I beg to you.

113
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,560
Please don't do this.

114
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,493
Please...

115
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:06,940
Kill her.

116
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:14,168
Which husband would give
10 crores to save his wife?

117
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:18,178
It's a wonderful plan, please kill her.

118
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:19,908
Don't take me for granted.

119
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:21,392
I will kill her for real.

120
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:23,194
Please kill her.

121
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:27,695
She carries insurance of 15 crores.

122
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,221
If you kill her,
I will get all that money.

123
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:34,562
I will pay you a commission of Rs. 6000.

124
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,217
How about Rs. 10,000?

125
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:41,897
We wasted our time.

126
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:52,642
Boss, what if he goes to the police?

127
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,630
What is the person who tries
to catch fish in the urine called?

128
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:56,993
He is called a miser.

129
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:58,510
He is even worse.

130
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,026
He looks for pearls in the urine.

131
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,521
He won't go to the police.

132
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:03,735
Let's go.
- Okay, boss. - We wasted our time.

133
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:06,759
Sir.

134
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:08,408
What are you looking for?

135
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:12,814
I dropped my money here.

136
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:19,602
Here it is.

137
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:24,434
Ma'am.
- Yes.

138
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:26,634
How are you?
- I am fine.

139
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:29,001
Do you remember her?
- Of course, yes.

140
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:30,938
She's Ms. Meenakshi.

141
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:35,148
Very good. You still remember me.
- Yes, I do.

142
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,786
Come. These are new machines.

143
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:42,026
Come.

144
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,711
Mom, total number of...

145
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:46,269
Lalita.
- Yes, ma'am.

146
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:49,710
Your child is crying, go and check.
- Okay, ma'am.

147
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:52,407
Lalita.
- Yes, ma'am.

148
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:56,935
We work hard for our children, right?
- Yes.

149
00:12:57,288 --> 00:13:00,179
So, if the mother is working
when the child is crying..

150
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:03,015
..it is wrong.
Go and console your child.

151
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,523
Go.
- Okay.

152
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,840
What happened?

153
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:22,214
Why are you crying?

154
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:26,063
Siddu.

155
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:28,305
Come here.

156
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:30,055
It's been six months.

157
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:34,488
I don't see any sign
of recovery in your mother.

158
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:38,709
Don't mind me, Siddu.

159
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:41,279
It is futile to continue
her treatment here.

160
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:44,638
I suggest you take her home.

161
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,205
Let she stay in her house
during her ending days.

162
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,789
Think about it.

163
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,117
Boy!

164
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:11,110
Get up! Come here!

165
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:15,865
Don't sit there. Come here. Listen to me.

166
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,858
You want your mother.

167
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:02,031
Yes.

168
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:07,911
What have you done so
far to get your mother cured?

169
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:09,844
I got her treated in all
the hospital across the world.

170
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,757
You have only spent the
money earned by your mother.

171
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:14,367
What have you done?

172
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,458
Did you spend your money?

173
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:22,871
I have nothing to spend.

174
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:25,582
What if you have?
- I will surely give it away.

175
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:27,682
Will you give away anything?

176
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,017
Yes, I will.

177
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:36,646
You must leave behind your wealth,
money and honour..

178
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:39,451
..and live like a common man.

179
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:43,336
For your mother who gave birth to you..

180
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:47,015
..you will have to live
leaving your identity behind.

181
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:50,138
You grew up without
knowing what hunger is!

182
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:53,413
You must beg for even one meal.

183
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:56,516
You must beg for alms.

184
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:04,040
You must live like a beggar
for a period of 48 days.

185
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,207
For those 48 days..

186
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:10,252
..nobody should know of your identity..

187
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,437
..and the reason for you to beg.

188
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:17,268
Can you live like
a beggar for your mother?

189
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:25,847
If I do it, will my mother get cure?

190
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:30,762
'If I do it.'

191
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:35,024
You didn't even utter the word beg.

192
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:38,941
Then how will you live
like a beggar for 48 days?

193
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,995
It's not the question
of what you will attain.

194
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,174
The question is what
you will offer to attain it.

195
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:49,847
The law of nature is evident.

196
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:52,695
Give and take.

197
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,186
You will get only if you give.

198
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,943
Many mothers make vows,
offer prayers, fast..

199
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:01,276
..to beget children,
to make her child speak..

200
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:08,765
..so that her grown up
children get married soon.

201
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:11,444
They eat food on the floor..

202
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:14,788
..beg for money on the
streets and offer it to God..

203
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,062
..but those mothers don't
ask question like you do.

204
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:24,053
Because her children
are not just children for her..

205
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:26,581
..but children are a part of them.

206
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:29,355
If you also love your mother..

207
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,472
..you will do what I said.

208
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:33,239
Remember.

209
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:39,540
Under any circumstances nobody
must know who you are for those 48 days.

210
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:43,479
You will beg for alms,
spend some money from it..

211
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:47,440
..and offer the remaining
money to God every day.

212
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:52,355
You must start your
day with empty hands again.

213
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,217
Will you do it?

214
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,684
I need to think.

215
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,199
Siddu.

216
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,426
Siddu.

217
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,834
Siddu.

218
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:44,910
Mother!
- Siddu!

219
00:22:47,053 --> 00:22:49,405
Siddu!
- Yes, mother!

220
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:54,621
Mother!

221
00:22:57,871 --> 00:22:59,203
I can't.

222
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:02,909
Please help me to sit, son.
- Okay, mother.

223
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,574
Water.
- I will bring.

224
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:16,712
Siddu!
- Yes, mother!

225
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:20,232
Will I die, son?

226
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:24,104
No, mom.
Nothing as such will happen.

227
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:28,245
I wish to spend some
more time with you, son.

228
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,620
Will you save me, Siddu?

229
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:47,391
Mother?

230
00:23:56,302 --> 00:24:01,191
'You must live like a beggar
for a period of 48 days.'

231
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:03,553
'Will you save me, Siddu?'

232
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:05,949
'The law of nature is evident.'

233
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,172
'Give and take.'

234
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:09,549
'You will get only when you give.'

235
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:12,082
'I wish to spend some
more time with you, son.'

236
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:15,734
'Can you live like
a beggar for your mother?'

237
00:24:16,952 --> 00:24:18,870
'If you love your mother..'

238
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,143
'..you will do what I say.'

239
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:40,694
Siddu.
- Yes.

240
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:42,412
Your paternal uncle is here.

241
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:51,387
Here's the production
review for this month.

242
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:56,140
Our both the factories
have fallen to down to 6th place.

243
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:59,934
I didn't say anything for all
these days because your mother is in coma..

244
00:25:00,343 --> 00:25:02,369
..but I am here today because
there's no other option.

245
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:03,858
Think for yourself..

246
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:07,376
..if you're running
the business correctly.

247
00:25:12,082 --> 00:25:13,327
Sorry, uncle.

248
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:15,987
I'm unable to concentrate on business..

249
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:18,658
..because of mother's condition.

250
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:19,852
Then sell them.

251
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:24,387
Why do you want to ruin the business?

252
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:29,028
If you sell it,
you will be left with at least property.

253
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,941
Okay, uncle.

254
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:41,004
Let's sell both big and small factories.

255
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:42,555
I...

256
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:53,717
Rajesh, I won't be in
town for the next 48 days.

257
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,084
What?
- Yes.

258
00:25:55,403 --> 00:25:57,056
Where are you going?

259
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:58,300
Don't ask me.

260
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:01,332
I will phone you if needed.

261
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:05,740
I have kept the signing authority
letters on my office table.

262
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:09,414
Take care of everything.
- I?

263
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:14,772
How can I? It is...
- Tell people I'm on foreign trip.

264
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,505
Mother.

265
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:22,321
Bye.

266
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,362
Excuse me. You forgot your coat.

267
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:31,044
Excuse me, sir.

268
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,368
Why are you leaving your bag? Sir...

269
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:39,058
I was going to the washroom.

270
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:40,642
This is offence, take it.

271
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:42,815
Sorry.

272
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:12,214
Sir, Rs. 1,600.

273
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,772
I have no change.

274
00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:15,186
Keep the change.

275
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,233
Sir!

276
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:41,783
Sir, give alms!

277
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:43,749
Ma'am, give alms!

278
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:46,041
Sir, give alms!

279
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:48,514
Sir, give alms! Ma'am!

280
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,689
Sir, give alms!

281
00:28:50,774 --> 00:28:52,468
Sir!

282
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:54,930
Sir, give alms!

283
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,459
'Remember.'

284
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:27,488
'Under any circumstances nobody
must know who you are for those 48 days.'

285
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:33,647
I haven't eaten for two days, sir.

286
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:36,642
Sir, give alms!
- Sir!

287
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,664
Sir!
- Sir, give alms!

288
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:41,138
You don't have to give only money.

289
00:29:41,223 --> 00:29:44,050
If you have food tokens, give it to us,
we will go and eat in the hotel..

290
00:29:44,135 --> 00:29:45,650
..but give Rs. 50
for auto rickshaw fare please.

291
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:46,907
He's opening his wallet.

292
00:29:48,423 --> 00:29:49,844
Sir!
- Please, sir.

293
00:29:56,851 --> 00:29:58,267
Sir!

294
00:29:58,553 --> 00:30:00,866
Take it. Share it.

295
00:30:08,322 --> 00:30:11,004
1, 2, 3, 4, there's Rs. 4500.

296
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:12,199
Rs. 4500?
- Yes.

297
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:13,357
Is he crazy?

298
00:30:13,442 --> 00:30:16,349
I don't know if he is crazy or not,
but we are lucky today.

299
00:30:16,434 --> 00:30:18,483
You're right. Look, someone is coming.

300
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:21,269
Give it to me.
- I won't give.

301
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,876
Ma'am!

302
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,608
Ma'am!

303
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,489
Please give me alms.

304
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:39,806
Ma'am!

305
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:41,730
Please give me alms.

306
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:43,793
Ma'am!

307
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,049
Ma'am!

308
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:55,392
I haven't eaten food for three days.

309
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:57,590
Please give me alms.

310
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:04,679
What?

311
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,321
Nothing. Sorry.
- Go away.

312
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:24,748
Where do you want to go?

313
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:28,183
Can I borrow the newspaper?

314
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:30,525
Okay. Take it.

315
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,278
'You didn't even utter the word beg.'

316
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:41,200
'Then how will you live
like a beggar for 48 days?'

317
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:44,547
Sir.
- Get going.

318
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:47,309
I said get going.

319
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:50,943
Sir, please give me alms.
- Get going.

320
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:54,181
Sorry, I was talking to someone else.

321
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,070
That's not a problem.

322
00:31:56,155 --> 00:31:57,756
We can talk to our regular boys.

323
00:31:58,037 --> 00:32:00,798
That's right.
- Have you informed them? - Yes.

324
00:32:00,949 --> 00:32:03,489
Sir, please give me alms.

325
00:32:04,343 --> 00:32:05,912
I haven't eaten food for three days.

326
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:10,956
You look fit and fine.

327
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:13,104
Instead of working hard, you beg for alms?

328
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:16,397
Why are you staring at me? Get going.

329
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:18,983
Sir...
- I will beat you. Get going.

330
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:22,022
Let go of him!
- He's begging for alms.

331
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,770
Sir, please give me alms.

332
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:41,018
Did you call Rajesh?
- Yes, sir.

333
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:45,245
Sir, would you like to have something?
- Nothing.

334
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,097
Need to attend SIIMA meeting.

335
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,489
Go and bring the valuation papers?

336
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:51,627
Okay, sir.

337
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:00,279
Sir, the file.

338
00:36:01,862 --> 00:36:03,978
Siddu loves Italian cuisine.

339
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:05,689
He has won best chef award also.

340
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:10,502
Seth.
- Sir.

341
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:16,794
Talk to Arul yourself.
- Okay, sir.

342
00:36:19,735 --> 00:36:21,123
By the way..

343
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:24,392
..I've been trying to call
Siddu past couple of days..

344
00:36:24,703 --> 00:36:26,557
..why is his phone switched off?

345
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:28,931
Sir, actually...

346
00:36:29,016 --> 00:36:30,808
I'm his paternal uncle.

347
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:32,709
Shouldn't you tell me?

348
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:35,288
Not like that, sir.
- Has he gone to Malaysia again?

349
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:39,687
Yes, sir. He has gone to Malaysia.
- Okay, give me his number.

350
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:42,523
Seth wants to talk to him.

351
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:45,749
Only he can call us..

352
00:36:46,713 --> 00:36:48,157
we can't call him.

353
00:36:51,553 --> 00:36:54,202
Don't you have his number?

354
00:36:58,364 --> 00:37:01,013
He should've at least given his number.
- Sir, is Mr. Siddharth in there?

355
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:02,817
Passport renewal has come.

356
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:06,486
Passport?
- Yes, sir.

357
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:09,558
They try to fool me.

358
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,646
Passport renewal has come.

359
00:37:13,636 --> 00:37:16,709
How did he go to Malaysia
without passport?

360
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,084
They're hiding something from me.

361
00:37:21,602 --> 00:37:26,061
Value of both factories
together is 265 crores.

362
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:28,309
Are just factories having
that much value? - Yes.

363
00:37:28,394 --> 00:37:29,650
Sir.
- Yes.

364
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,504
I must say.

365
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:35,195
Our property is more compared to theirs.

366
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:39,180
Marappa.
- Yes.

367
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,937
Stop the car.
- Okay, sir.

368
00:37:43,885 --> 00:37:45,288
Seth.
- Sir.

369
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:46,938
Get down.

370
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:50,161
There's bus stop behind, go by bus.

371
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:52,461
Get down here?
- Yes.

372
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:54,002
Okay, sir.

373
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:59,249
Oh, my God.
- What is it to you?

374
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:00,780
I will kill you.

375
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:02,191
To heck with you.

376
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:04,404
It's true that our property
is more compared to theirs..

377
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:08,103
..but my wife has given
births to two daughters.

378
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:09,701
You idiot.

379
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:13,002
I won't get any share from the property,
because she has only one son.

380
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:16,011
He is the sole heir for
property worth 900 crores.

381
00:38:16,096 --> 00:38:17,720
You idiot.

382
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:23,878
You're a miser.
- Ma'am!

383
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:30,155
Guru! - Yes. - I found 1.5 crores
in my suitcase last night.

384
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:32,202
1.5 crores?
- Yes.

385
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:34,122
Does anyone talk about it in open?

386
00:38:34,463 --> 00:38:37,229
Where did so much money come from?
What did you do with the money?

387
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:39,802
The IT Department came
to raid the money..

388
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:42,708
..I ran and picked up the suitcase..

389
00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:45,479
..while a dog came
and peed on my face..

390
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:47,857
..I woke up and my dream broke.

391
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:49,618
You idiot.

392
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:51,515
Stop talking rubbish.

393
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,305
Now, take your bowl..

394
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,633
..and continue begging.
- Okay.

395
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,076
Ma'am!

396
00:38:59,676 --> 00:39:00,967
Hey!

397
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:03,961
Here comes the rich man.

398
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:06,605
Sir, what brings you here?

399
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:08,957
I told you he is a madman.

400
00:39:09,126 --> 00:39:12,333
Did your parents beat you
and ask you bring the money back?

401
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:17,857
Look, once you give money to
beggars you won't get it back. - Yes.

402
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:21,445
No exchange, no refund.
You won't get your money back. You got it?

403
00:39:21,738 --> 00:39:23,580
Give me Rs. 10 and get out.

404
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:25,707
I am not here for my money.

405
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:27,819
Then?

406
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,258
I will beg..

407
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,065
..with you.

408
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,715
You will beg with us?
- Yes.

409
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,323
Why?
- People who come here to beg..

410
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:41,797
..will be suffering from some disease.

411
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,277
Just like us, isn't it?

412
00:39:43,636 --> 00:39:44,632
After listening to this story..

413
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:47,443
..there might come a situation where
we might have to give our money to him.

414
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:49,159
Let's be careful.
- You're absolutely right.

415
00:39:49,627 --> 00:39:54,167
Hello, no flashback, join the duty.
Take the appointment letter.

416
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:56,437
Sit.
- Sit down.

417
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:04,322
Sir, why are you kneeling down?

418
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:05,966
Sit down.

419
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,229
Turn around.

420
00:40:12,001 --> 00:40:14,590
You look like the son of a rich man.

421
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:15,851
You don't look like beggars.

422
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:18,459
Even Mother Teresa won't
get emotional seeing you.

423
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,473
Give me the makeup kit.
- Yes.

424
00:40:20,558 --> 00:40:21,753
Take it.

425
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:26,576
What's this? Your cheeks look chubby.

426
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:28,463
Don't get attacked to him.
- Hey!

427
00:40:28,548 --> 00:40:29,657
Shut up.

428
00:40:30,243 --> 00:40:32,183
You look good now.

429
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,853
Should I apply it every day?

430
00:40:34,938 --> 00:40:37,245
No, apply it only for a couple of days.

431
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:39,895
Start singing and start begging.

432
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:43,548
Usually, a hero looks
ugly in his debut film..

433
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:45,031
..but after he acts a couple of films..

434
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:46,972
..the audience will be impressed with him.

435
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:49,546
Will the hero become popular
in the very first film?

436
00:40:49,718 --> 00:40:52,596
No. It's all in the
mindset of the audience.

437
00:40:52,856 --> 00:40:55,342
Similarly,
even people will accept you as a beggar.

438
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:56,390
Don't worry.

439
00:40:56,574 --> 00:40:59,249
But you were born handsome.

440
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:00,806
Thanks.

441
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,128
Look, don't beg for alms..

442
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:06,400
..and disturb the devotees
when they are entering the temple.

443
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:08,946
Let them first beg for alms from God..

444
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:11,169
..and we will beg for alms
when they step out of the temple.

445
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:12,738
Try to understand the psychology.

446
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,002
Like this. Like this.

447
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:18,418
You didn't understand?
- No.

448
00:41:18,857 --> 00:41:20,681
This is their way..

449
00:41:21,298 --> 00:41:23,242
..and this is our way.

450
00:41:23,729 --> 00:41:25,602
Now, try it.

451
00:41:26,052 --> 00:41:27,418
Ma'am!

452
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:30,513
Hello. People won't give
alms if you just look at them.

453
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:32,804
Call out.
- Ma'am!

454
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:34,917
Not like that. Ma'am!

455
00:41:35,584 --> 00:41:37,426
Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

456
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:39,512
Ma'am!
- Melody is very important.

457
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:42,630
Your voice should make people emotional.

458
00:41:42,813 --> 00:41:44,891
Ma'am! Join with me!

459
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:47,443
Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

460
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:50,757
Sir!

461
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,350
Hello!

462
00:41:54,698 --> 00:41:56,075
Get out.

463
00:41:56,284 --> 00:41:58,223
Practice. Ma'am!

464
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,658
Ma'am!

465
00:42:00,788 --> 00:42:02,764
Ma'am!
- More pain.

466
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:04,515
Sir, please give me alms.
- Ma'am!

467
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,921
Sir! - Please give me alms.
- Hello. Sir.

468
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:09,352
Hello! Ma'am!
- Sir, please give me alms.

469
00:42:09,437 --> 00:42:10,812
Sir! - Sir, please give me alms.
- Hello.

470
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:12,988
Ma'am! Sir! - Sir!
- Hello!

471
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,279
Sir, please give me alms.
- Ma'am!

472
00:42:14,526 --> 00:42:16,736
Hello! Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

473
00:42:16,894 --> 00:42:19,141
Sir!
- Sir!

474
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,293
Have you packed the items?
- Take it, ma'am.

475
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,824
Hello. Rajesh.
- Siddu.

476
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:56,787
Mother.
- No improvement.

477
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:01,931
She has high temperature
past couple of days.

478
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,302
Where are you, Siddu?

479
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,200
Siddu!

480
00:43:30,685 --> 00:43:31,891
I am sorry.

481
00:43:55,778 --> 00:43:59,970
Hello, you don't know me.

482
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,597
The owner of the phone
has fallen unconscious.

483
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:05,095
Your number was in received call list.

484
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,492
I am near the wine store
beside Udupi Clock Tower.

485
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:19,564
Bindu, what are you doing?

486
00:44:19,649 --> 00:44:23,438
Mother, look at him.
He's a father of a child.

487
00:44:23,724 --> 00:44:25,581
He has fallen unconscious.

488
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:29,061
Poor child would be waiting
for this book, right?

489
00:44:38,338 --> 00:44:41,401
'You will beg for alms,
spend some money from it..'

490
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:45,302
'..and offer the remaining
money to God every day.'

491
00:44:50,261 --> 00:44:53,019
Sir, please give me alms.

492
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:54,535
You give me first.

493
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:56,249
I am asking you.

494
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,853
Sir, please give me alms.
- If you give me, I will give you.

495
00:44:59,938 --> 00:45:01,140
I have nothing with me, sir.

496
00:45:01,225 --> 00:45:04,116
Don't lie. Your lips are beautiful.

497
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:08,419
Sir...
- What?

498
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:12,066
Sorry, sir.
- Siddu!

499
00:45:12,494 --> 00:45:15,333
There are foreigners in the auto rickshaw,
let's beg for alms, come.

500
00:45:15,418 --> 00:45:17,045
Sir, please give me alms.

501
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,291
Sania, Julia, please give me money.
Hello. Please help me.

502
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:23,286
Hello.
- Please, ma'am.

503
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:25,567
Take it.
- Sir, please give me alms.

504
00:45:25,652 --> 00:45:27,757
Give me money.
- Thanks for your kindness.

505
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:30,496
Thank you.
- Why do you ask for more money?

506
00:45:30,581 --> 00:45:32,458
I am not...

507
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:36,149
Don't ask for her kidney,
ask for something more.

508
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,048
Girija!
- Yes.

509
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:41,060
I have brought dollars!
- How much?

510
00:45:41,145 --> 00:45:42,899
25 dollars.
- It is foreign exchange?

511
00:45:42,984 --> 00:45:45,643
I have deducted commission.
Count the money.

512
00:45:45,728 --> 00:45:46,759
Thank you.

513
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,414
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

514
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:51,111
Here's your share Rs. 300.

515
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:52,674
Rs. 600 for me.
- Take it.

516
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,718
I want to buy a shirt.

517
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:57,883
This one stinks.

518
00:46:00,107 --> 00:46:04,778
Welcome. This is our showroom.

519
00:46:07,828 --> 00:46:09,070
See my showroom.

520
00:46:09,155 --> 00:46:12,161
You asked for shirt, right?
These are rejected shirts.

521
00:46:12,246 --> 00:46:13,723
What's the size?

522
00:46:14,117 --> 00:46:15,932
I would rather...
- Sir.

523
00:46:16,017 --> 00:46:19,600
I... - Most of the money
we earn is spend on food..

524
00:46:19,685 --> 00:46:22,786
..will you want to buy a land
near a beach and build a resort?

525
00:46:23,344 --> 00:46:24,582
Just chill.

526
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:26,984
The work we do...

527
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,850
What do you think of our job?

528
00:46:29,935 --> 00:46:35,582
You think we beggars
beg for alms all day long?

529
00:46:35,863 --> 00:46:40,314
Will the doctor inject
the patient all the time?

530
00:46:40,399 --> 00:46:41,608
Try to understand.

531
00:46:41,876 --> 00:46:43,687
Like people go back home..

532
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:48,025
..or liquor shop and are lost in
their world after finishing the duty at 6..

533
00:46:48,302 --> 00:46:50,355
..even the beggars do the same.

534
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,658
They have their personal life after 6.

535
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:53,695
Take it.

536
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,073
The shirt will surely fit you..

537
00:46:56,158 --> 00:46:59,127
..and if it doesn't,
come and take whichever you want.

538
00:47:00,337 --> 00:47:01,589
Thank you.

539
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,271
Come, sit down.
- Never mind.

540
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:08,132
I called you to iron, come and sit.

541
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:11,903
If you sit on it and move your body,
the shirt will get ironed.

542
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,489
Don't wear this shirt tomorrow for duty..

543
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:17,073
..people won't give alms.

544
00:47:17,158 --> 00:47:20,840
If you want alms,
you should be blind..

545
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:22,998
..or handicap.

546
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:26,225
You should not have half
hand like Mangalore Masterpiece.

547
00:47:26,605 --> 00:47:27,819
It's me only.

548
00:47:27,904 --> 00:47:30,146
See.
- Okay.

549
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:32,360
How much for the shirt?

550
00:47:34,115 --> 00:47:36,014
You're like my brother.

551
00:47:58,056 --> 00:47:59,223
I am so sorry.

552
00:47:59,308 --> 00:48:01,198
I was really trying to kill a fly..

553
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:04,059
..but I accidently hit you.
Take a look if you want to.

554
00:48:06,473 --> 00:48:08,949
It's okay.
- I am extremely sorry.

555
00:48:09,343 --> 00:48:10,511
Never mind.

556
00:48:29,446 --> 00:48:31,556
Sir. - Yes.
- Menu.

557
00:48:32,087 --> 00:48:33,231
Thank you.

558
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:48,110
You didn't wash your hand yet.

559
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,529
I will continue to kill flies after
you leave, I will wash my hand at night.

560
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,644
What?

561
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:59,005
Nothing, sir. Run through the menu.
I will wash my hand and come. - Okay.

562
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:01,078
Excuse me.
- Yes.

563
00:49:01,163 --> 00:49:02,940
One mini veg pizza.
- Sure, sir.

564
00:49:05,578 --> 00:49:07,665
Girls, customer.

565
00:49:12,627 --> 00:49:14,165
Mom, we have a customer.

566
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,548
Yes!

567
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:16,954
Okay. I got to go.

568
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,829
I had vowed to offer Rs. 100
to God if we had customer today.

569
00:49:19,914 --> 00:49:21,983
I will fulfill the vow and come.
- Okay.

570
00:49:26,142 --> 00:49:27,901
Why did you become dull? What happened?

571
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,020
He ordered only
a small pizza worth Rs. 75..

572
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:34,828
..but you offered Rs. 100 to God.

573
00:49:35,204 --> 00:49:37,380
Okay.
We have at least one customer..

574
00:49:37,465 --> 00:49:38,422
..so let's be happy, okay?

575
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:40,285
Come on, guys. Let's do this.

576
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:42,189
Quick!

577
00:50:27,564 --> 00:50:28,858
What do we do?

578
00:50:29,144 --> 00:50:31,104
Our boss dropped us here and went away..

579
00:50:31,682 --> 00:50:33,356
..we have no money too.

580
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:35,354
The director will be waiting for me.

581
00:50:35,503 --> 00:50:36,670
Are you doing a film, Manja?

582
00:50:36,755 --> 00:50:39,166
You're an idiot.
- What?

583
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,938
I said I am waiting for liquor.

584
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:45,980
Hey! - Yes.
- Look there. - What?

585
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,873
Manja, if you have Rs. 1000..

586
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,538
..how much will you offer to God?

587
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:53,379
Even if I have 1 lakh rupees,
I will offer only 1 rupee.

588
00:50:53,464 --> 00:50:55,250
He offered Rs. 500 to God..

589
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:57,178
..so he must be a rich man.

590
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,940
He must be having plenty
of money in his wallet.

591
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:12,645
Give me Rs. 1000.

592
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,981
Rs. 1000?
- Hey!

593
00:51:15,427 --> 00:51:17,243
Why do you get surprised?

594
00:51:17,543 --> 00:51:19,705
Did we demand for high amount?

595
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:23,461
All right,
we will give 10 percent discount..

596
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:25,745
..give us Rs. 900.

597
00:51:25,899 --> 00:51:28,648
I just offered all the money to God.

598
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:30,290
To God?
- Yes.

599
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:34,894
Will you offer all your
money to God and beg for alms?

600
00:51:37,183 --> 00:51:38,327
Yes, sir.

601
00:51:38,454 --> 00:51:40,499
Are you kidding us?

602
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:42,731
I will thrash you. Give me the money.

603
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:44,452
Sir, I'm telling you truth.

604
00:51:44,537 --> 00:51:45,818
From what I get in begging..

605
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:48,200
..deducting my expenses,
I give away some money for charity..

606
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:52,064
..and offer the remaining money to God.

607
00:51:52,149 --> 00:51:54,681
Some foreigners gave
me some dollars yesterday..

608
00:51:54,766 --> 00:51:56,041
..and I...

609
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:58,052
Are you cooking tales for me?

610
00:51:58,137 --> 00:52:00,698
Sir...
- Snatch the money from him.

611
00:52:00,783 --> 00:52:02,086
Sir, I have no money.

612
00:52:02,171 --> 00:52:04,769
Please try to understand.
- Are you my lover to understand you?

613
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:06,697
Sir.

614
00:52:07,306 --> 00:52:09,351
Manja. - Yes.
- He has no money..

615
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:10,993
..he has a photograph of
a beautiful woman.

616
00:52:11,078 --> 00:52:12,578
He must be a womanizer.

617
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:14,341
Sir, please give it.

618
00:52:15,106 --> 00:52:16,602
Give it to me.

619
00:52:16,897 --> 00:52:19,148
Wow! She is stunning, isn't it?

620
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:21,315
Seeing her with sari won't be fun.

621
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,240
Imagine her in bikini or skirt.

622
00:52:35,221 --> 00:52:36,186
Hey!

623
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:39,955
Oh, my God!

624
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:41,590
Oh, my God!

625
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:44,272
Oh, my God!

626
00:54:04,322 --> 00:54:05,861
Beware.

627
00:54:15,428 --> 00:54:16,985
Mom!

628
00:54:36,804 --> 00:54:40,242
Pick me up, I can't bear the pain.

629
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:42,652
Come and pick me.

630
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,865
Look at you.
- Oh, my God!

631
00:54:45,021 --> 00:54:46,747
Oh, my God!
- Sir, just a minute.

632
00:54:46,832 --> 00:54:50,877
He's my friend.
He slipped and fell inside the bin.

633
00:54:50,962 --> 00:54:52,523
Please help us, sir.

634
00:54:52,608 --> 00:54:53,874
Idiot!

635
00:54:53,959 --> 00:54:55,421
Who is idiot?
- Your father. - Really?

636
00:54:55,506 --> 00:54:57,917
You mess with our boy
and try to seek help from us.

637
00:54:58,002 --> 00:54:59,398
Pick him fast..

638
00:54:59,483 --> 00:55:01,961
..thrash truck will arrive any moment.
- Let's go.

639
00:55:03,096 --> 00:55:04,934
Do you know who thrashed you?

640
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:07,251
Who?
- A beggar.

641
00:55:07,336 --> 00:55:09,863
A beggar! Oh, my God!

642
00:55:09,948 --> 00:55:14,056
He has thrashed me to pulp.

643
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,354
Oh no.

644
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:47,264
Oh, my God!

645
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:50,774
You stupid fool, are you blind?
- Sorry, sir.

646
00:55:50,928 --> 00:55:53,615
You applied break suddenly.
- You idiot.

647
00:55:53,882 --> 00:55:56,096
Don't you know you should maintain gap?

648
00:55:56,537 --> 00:55:58,919
Sir, I will pay for the damages.

649
00:55:59,004 --> 00:56:00,806
How much will you pay me?

650
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:03,067
How much will you pay me?
What do you think?

651
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:06,556
It is not a two wheeler to pay
Rs. 500 or Rs. 1000 and settle the issue.

652
00:56:06,757 --> 00:56:08,225
It's Benz car.

653
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:11,443
The charges for only servicing
the car will be around Rs. 25,000.

654
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:13,061
Will you pay that money?

655
00:56:13,202 --> 00:56:16,148
Answer me. Will you pay that money?

656
00:56:16,397 --> 00:56:17,785
You won't understand.

657
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,825
It is the system that needs to be blamed..

658
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,594
..for having common roads for royal
people like me and poor people like you.

659
00:56:23,758 --> 00:56:26,994
Go and deliver pizzas, eat snacks..

660
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:29,277
..with the tip money. Idiot.

661
00:56:29,362 --> 00:56:30,399
Excuse me.

662
00:56:31,962 --> 00:56:34,555
Does your car have insurance?
- Yes.

663
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,267
Then go claim for it.

664
00:56:36,474 --> 00:56:38,308
Don't underestimate because you're rich.

665
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,888
You said you were from royal family.

666
00:56:40,973 --> 00:56:43,452
You think you're from a royal
family because you own a Benz car?

667
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,764
Do you know the rate of Benz,
higher end model?

668
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:48,171
3 crores, 65 lakhs, plus GST..

669
00:56:48,657 --> 00:56:53,399
..and this car is only 70 lakhs.
Do you think you're rich?

670
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:56,786
PY, Pondicherry registration.

671
00:56:57,025 --> 00:56:58,943
Just to save 3 lakhs..

672
00:56:59,028 --> 00:57:01,812
..you get your car registered
with fake ID..

673
00:57:01,933 --> 00:57:04,949
..and drive the car in our
state without paying road tax..

674
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:07,008
..and you say you belong
to a royal family.

675
00:57:07,322 --> 00:57:10,014
You're insulting a girl saying
you belong to a royal family.

676
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:14,345
Did you purchase the car
by paying cash or through finance?

677
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,127
Come, show me your RC book.

678
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:25,630
You're driving the car without
turning on the air-condition.

679
00:57:25,715 --> 00:57:27,680
Do you want to save petrol?

680
00:57:31,268 --> 00:57:33,425
You're absolutely right, sir.

681
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,367
Superb. What do you do, sir?

682
00:57:38,317 --> 00:57:41,098
'Share it.'
- He works in share market.

683
00:57:41,183 --> 00:57:42,904
He works in share market.

684
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:45,535
He knows everything about cars.

685
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,940
Why are you still here? Get going.

686
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,539
Thank you.

687
00:57:49,624 --> 00:57:53,034
Do you remember you had
come to our restaurant? - Yes.

688
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:57,195
Can I have your number?
- Sorry, I don't use phone.

689
00:58:00,127 --> 00:58:02,490
Take my number. We're colleagues.
- Okay.

690
00:58:02,575 --> 00:58:04,848
99456637.

691
00:58:04,933 --> 00:58:06,983
Please don't call while I am on duty.

692
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,276
Okay. - Good girl.
She believed what I said.

693
00:58:12,766 --> 00:58:14,464
Look, Manja.
- I saw you.

694
00:58:14,684 --> 00:58:19,042
Pledge that you won't tell anyone
that we got thrashed by a beggar.

695
00:58:19,182 --> 00:58:21,175
Look, there is no need for this.

696
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:24,475
My family is good at maintaining secrets.

697
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,369
Do you think I will expose you? Never.

698
00:58:28,782 --> 00:58:30,934
Look, don't trust him.

699
00:58:31,065 --> 00:58:32,688
He is like weather.

700
00:58:32,773 --> 00:58:35,123
I changes frequently.

701
00:58:35,352 --> 00:58:38,194
It will be a shame for us if
our aide finds out that we got thrashed.

702
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:41,946
People fear us because we're dangerous.

703
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:44,741
If they find out that
we got thrashed by a beggar..

704
00:58:45,462 --> 00:58:47,915
..the other goons will
treat us like cowards.

705
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:50,617
Make him pledge immediately.
- Go on.

706
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:53,774
I don't feel good here,
let's go to another temple.

707
00:58:54,049 --> 00:58:55,625
To another temple?

708
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:58,622
Some more.

709
00:59:01,847 --> 00:59:03,489
Pledge at least now.

710
00:59:03,939 --> 00:59:06,411
Stop pestering me.

711
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:09,834
You got thrashed by a beggar..

712
00:59:09,919 --> 00:59:14,732
..I won't tell him, I mean..

713
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:16,773
..I won't tell our aide..

714
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:18,373
..or anybody.

715
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:19,616
Okay?

716
00:59:19,701 --> 00:59:21,967
Pledge right away.
- Correct.

717
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:23,735
Get me more liquor..

718
00:59:23,904 --> 00:59:25,855
..of the same brand please.

719
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,346
We have no money.

720
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,776
Drink my beer if you want.

721
00:59:29,978 --> 00:59:31,629
What do you think of me?

722
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:34,564
The tiger won't eat
grass even if it is hungry.

723
00:59:34,649 --> 00:59:38,941
Similarly, I won't drink beer at any cost.

724
00:59:39,513 --> 00:59:42,880
Go and bring more liquor.

725
00:59:43,049 --> 00:59:45,736
Give me money.

726
00:59:45,821 --> 00:59:47,083
There's money over here.

727
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:48,602
I will repay tomorrow.
- I said I have no money.

728
00:59:48,687 --> 00:59:50,525
Take it.

729
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,292
I love you.
- Get away.

730
00:59:53,874 --> 00:59:56,609
Buddy! I got a call.

731
00:59:59,118 --> 01:00:04,905
Hello. - Sir,
give me liquor of the same brand.

732
01:00:05,581 --> 01:00:08,118
Sena. - Sir.
- Don't mind me if I say something.

733
01:00:08,203 --> 01:00:10,460
You're getting married next week,
why do you fight?

734
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,160
You got thrashed by a beggar..

735
01:00:14,245 --> 01:00:16,332
..and you celebrating. Get away.

736
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:20,682
Really?

737
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:24,280
Oh, my God!
- Hey!

738
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,637
Why are you beating him? Don't.

739
01:00:27,722 --> 01:00:29,434
Don't beat him! Let's go!

740
01:00:29,983 --> 01:00:32,624
Let go of him!
- Leave me!

741
01:00:32,849 --> 01:00:34,068
Answer the phone first.

742
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:38,101
You! How dare you?

743
01:00:38,274 --> 01:00:41,126
Yes, dear.
- Where are you? - With my boss.

744
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:42,753
Shame on you!

745
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:45,239
You stole my money..

746
01:00:45,324 --> 01:00:47,930
..and partying in the liquor bar?

747
01:00:48,513 --> 01:00:51,191
You're celebrating for
getting thrashed by a beggar.

748
01:00:51,276 --> 01:00:54,498
Come, I will teach you.

749
01:00:55,212 --> 01:00:56,834
Oh, my God!

750
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:04,429
What happened? - You revealed our secret
though you promised that you wouldn't.

751
01:01:05,858 --> 01:01:08,855
Beat him!

752
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:16,589
Hey!

753
01:02:11,172 --> 01:02:13,201
Siddu!

754
01:02:21,878 --> 01:02:23,573
Hey!
- Idiots!

755
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:27,812
You come here every day to molest despite
of knowing she's mentally retarded.

756
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:32,904
Fortunately,
you were present with us today.

757
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:35,006
Come, my dear.

758
01:02:35,091 --> 01:02:38,055
Come! Don't be adamant! Come!

759
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:41,684
Siddu, let's go to sleep.

760
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:44,798
Come.

761
01:03:06,165 --> 01:03:07,657
Are you thanking me?

762
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:16,381
I know how difficult it
is to pretend before the world.

763
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:20,607
I don't know you're from
and why you are like this..

764
01:03:20,727 --> 01:03:21,940
..but you are not mad.

765
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:25,287
I know you are pretending
to be a mad girl.

766
01:03:28,673 --> 01:03:30,404
Did you sign?
- Yes, I did.

767
01:03:31,384 --> 01:03:33,542
Give it to sir.
- Sir.

768
01:03:33,983 --> 01:03:35,179
Sir.

769
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:41,035
Where is the girl?
- She is outside.

770
01:03:42,697 --> 01:03:44,915
They gave admission for free here.

771
01:03:45,398 --> 01:03:47,123
If you stay here, you will be safe.

772
01:03:47,243 --> 01:03:50,178
I will take you to another
place after a few days.

773
01:03:52,185 --> 01:03:54,084
Be careful, she is coming.

774
01:03:55,012 --> 01:03:56,864
Are you with patient named Geeta?

775
01:03:56,949 --> 01:03:58,703
Yes.
- Please come.

776
01:03:59,149 --> 01:04:00,983
Come.

777
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,061
This is her bed.
- Okay.

778
01:04:11,146 --> 01:04:14,120
You get one hour to meet
the patient every Saturday.

779
01:04:14,205 --> 01:04:16,756
You can come and spend time with her,
okay? - Okay.

780
01:04:18,565 --> 01:04:19,986
Yes!

781
01:04:41,428 --> 01:04:43,266
How is that girl related to you?

782
01:04:43,726 --> 01:04:45,076
Her father is a farmer.

783
01:04:45,574 --> 01:04:47,408
He used to do farming by taking loan.

784
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:51,434
They shifted to Bangalore due to drought.

785
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:53,464
After they shifted there..

786
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:56,146
..he used to work as a watchman in an ATM.

787
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:59,841
Her father lost his life
when the ATM was being looted..

788
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:02,562
..and she became an orphan.

789
01:05:03,069 --> 01:05:05,906
She is pretending to defend herself.

790
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:09,213
I will take her to a
better place in a few days.

791
01:05:12,289 --> 01:05:15,403
Why?
- For doing such a good deed.

792
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:18,311
In that case, you're great too.
- Why?

793
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:21,054
When people in the city
are busy with their things..

794
01:05:21,368 --> 01:05:24,496
..a man was fallen down,
ignoring that he was a drunkard..

795
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:26,537
..you helped him, so you're great.

796
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,541
After graduating from college,
I received many job offers from MCs..

797
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,122
..but I was not interested.

798
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:37,606
My friend and I opened a pizza cafe..

799
01:05:37,996 --> 01:05:40,627
..but business is not
happening as we expected.

800
01:05:41,185 --> 01:05:43,793
The dough gets spoilt
in the freezer itself.

801
01:05:43,878 --> 01:05:47,732
So, we come to centers like
this and give it away for free.

802
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:51,762
Anyway, we're planning to
shut down the business this month.

803
01:05:52,244 --> 01:05:54,885
Why?
- There's no business at all.

804
01:05:55,012 --> 01:05:57,717
You saw us killing flies all the time.

805
01:05:57,802 --> 01:06:02,676
Hence, even rare customers
like you get beaten up.

806
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,274
Bindu.
- Yes.

807
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:11,495
Did you like her?

808
01:06:13,295 --> 01:06:14,453
She's good, mom.

809
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:16,779
There are photographs of several girls.

810
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:19,287
Take a look at all of them.
- Mom.

811
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:24,864
No, mom. I feel she is my girl.

812
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:28,212
Siddu.
- Yes. - Look here.

813
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:32,669
Bindu. Since you wouldn't believe..

814
01:06:32,754 --> 01:06:34,203
..I had already written the name.

815
01:06:34,531 --> 01:06:36,140
I liked her too.

816
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,251
Good choice.

817
01:06:40,855 --> 01:06:42,905
Drop the idea of shutting
down your restaurant.

818
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,639
I will come to your
restaurant every evening.

819
01:06:45,724 --> 01:06:51,115
Can I run the restaurant just
for the mini pizza that you order?

820
01:06:51,331 --> 01:06:53,981
Practically, it is difficult.

821
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,461
I am not coming as a customer..

822
01:06:56,739 --> 01:06:58,864
..but as a chef. Come.

823
01:09:51,072 --> 01:09:52,998
Why did you delete the picture?

824
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:54,751
There's a beggar at the background.

825
01:09:58,937 --> 01:10:01,135
What are you doing there?
Come over here.

826
01:10:02,141 --> 01:10:03,215
Come.

827
01:10:03,502 --> 01:10:06,645
Now, let me see which
beggar will come in between us.

828
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,741
Stop!

829
01:11:17,826 --> 01:11:19,240
Go to sir.

830
01:11:19,503 --> 01:11:20,940
Stop!

831
01:11:21,025 --> 01:11:23,900
Oh no. I did not renewal the insurance.

832
01:11:25,124 --> 01:11:26,866
Wait, I will go and talk to him.

833
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:28,494
I'll be back.

834
01:11:28,658 --> 01:11:30,745
Sir, the insurance...
- Give Rs. 100 and go.

835
01:11:30,962 --> 01:11:32,974
Sir, I have no money.

836
01:11:33,059 --> 01:11:35,406
You don't have even Rs. 100?

837
01:11:35,599 --> 01:11:37,395
What do you do?

838
01:11:39,013 --> 01:11:40,166
I am beggar, sir.

839
01:11:41,161 --> 01:11:44,210
A beggar? Are you kidding me?

840
01:11:44,363 --> 01:11:46,830
No, sir.
- Wait a minute.

841
01:11:46,962 --> 01:11:48,106
Constable, come here.

842
01:11:48,191 --> 01:11:49,518
Take the vehicle to the station.
- Sir.

843
01:11:49,603 --> 01:11:50,795
Please believe me, sir.

844
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,787
I am a beggar.

845
01:11:52,872 --> 01:11:54,912
I have taken alms from you several times.

846
01:11:54,997 --> 01:11:56,576
From me?
- Yes, sir.

847
01:11:56,661 --> 01:12:01,129
Where? - You visit Lord
Krishna temple every Sunday.

848
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:03,076
You offer prayers with complete devotion.

849
01:12:03,254 --> 01:12:05,720
You look around, you do sit ups..

850
01:12:05,805 --> 01:12:07,592
..sit in a corner and weep.

851
01:12:07,677 --> 01:12:10,649
You then wipe your tears and
leave the temple as if nothing happened..

852
01:12:10,809 --> 01:12:13,952
..and give alms only to female beggars.

853
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:16,021
Like a hero, you...

854
01:12:16,106 --> 01:12:17,832
Stop it.

855
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,520
I now believe you're a beggar.

856
01:12:20,318 --> 01:12:22,391
Who is that girl?

857
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:29,098
She is my girlfriend.
- What?

858
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,311
Yes, sir.

859
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:33,098
I am 45 years old..

860
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:36,542
..but I didn't find a single girl.
Moreover, I am a government employee.

861
01:12:36,702 --> 01:12:38,099
That's why I go to that temple..

862
01:12:38,184 --> 01:12:41,392
..and plead Lord Krishna
to help me find a girl to marry.

863
01:12:41,477 --> 01:12:44,272
Is that the reason you
give alms only to female beggars?

864
01:12:44,357 --> 01:12:45,266
Yes.

865
01:12:45,351 --> 01:12:47,011
If I manage to woo of them..

866
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,731
..I will marry her.

867
01:12:48,816 --> 01:12:52,024
Just like she fell in love with you.

868
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:53,412
Go.

869
01:12:55,016 --> 01:12:56,803
Sir, your hat.

870
01:12:58,092 --> 01:13:01,569
I shall leave, sir.
- Get out of my sight. Go away.

871
01:13:01,689 --> 01:13:02,595
Okay, sir.

872
01:13:05,117 --> 01:13:06,904
How did you convince him?

873
01:13:07,045 --> 01:13:08,442
What did you tell him?

874
01:13:09,657 --> 01:13:11,665
I told him the truth.

875
01:13:12,044 --> 01:13:13,072
Come.

876
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:19,314
The building beside the road..

877
01:13:19,722 --> 01:13:21,471
..survey no. 241..

878
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:23,137
..it's a small factory.

879
01:13:23,343 --> 01:13:25,323
It is worth 48 crores.

880
01:13:25,408 --> 01:13:28,742
And survey no. 241A..

881
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:32,071
..241B, both together, it is a big factory.

882
01:13:33,137 --> 01:13:35,604
217 crores.

883
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:37,544
Both the properties are for sale.

884
01:13:37,629 --> 01:13:41,905
I will buy both the properties
from my brother's son..

885
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:44,311
..but as a proxy.

886
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:48,515
You must prepare the
documents in Seth's name.

887
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,118
Okay?
- Okay, sir.

888
01:13:50,273 --> 01:13:53,564
I will sanction both loans
from my bank immediately.

889
01:13:53,649 --> 01:13:56,599
You shouldn't do it immediately.

890
01:13:56,983 --> 01:13:57,954
Why, sir?

891
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:02,404
Look, first sanction loan..

892
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:04,810
..for the small factory beside the road.

893
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,989
For the big factory, both the survey nos..

894
01:14:08,074 --> 01:14:11,965
..cite some reason and
delay the documentation.

895
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:17,482
If we purchase it, the access
for this big factory will be locked.

896
01:14:17,567 --> 01:14:19,991
The surrounding is reserve forest land..

897
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:22,843
..so helicopter would be needed..

898
01:14:22,928 --> 01:14:24,532
..to bring the goods inside.

899
01:14:25,118 --> 01:14:30,329
Just watch, I will get
the money I demand for this land.

900
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,402
As you please.

901
01:14:32,918 --> 01:14:37,242
I haven't received commission
for the loan I sanctioned the last time.

902
01:14:39,489 --> 01:14:43,081
There's no difference between
private sector and public sector..

903
01:14:43,274 --> 01:14:45,220
..everyone take bribe.

904
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:48,198
This commission is for him.

905
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:50,933
Don't try to siphon money from it. Go.

906
01:14:58,268 --> 01:14:59,947
Sir.
- Yes.

907
01:15:00,318 --> 01:15:03,357
Why do you look dull?

908
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,439
Marappa.

909
01:15:08,582 --> 01:15:13,526
You yourself gave the
commission money of 4.5 lakhs.

910
01:15:13,844 --> 01:15:16,123
When my younger brother was ailing..

911
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,997
..we couldn't afford his treatment.
- Stop it, sir.

912
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:23,852
He was then ready to sell this
house and property only for 10 lakhs.

913
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:28,346
She ruined my plot by slipping into coma.

914
01:15:28,431 --> 01:15:31,352
I lost the wealth and the properties.

915
01:15:31,437 --> 01:15:33,411
Sir, leave me.
- Had this happen earlier..

916
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:37,205
I would've got his property, Marappa.

917
01:15:38,374 --> 01:15:40,254
My God.
- I still have time.

918
01:15:41,229 --> 01:15:44,944
I will acquire the factories
first and then the house.

919
01:15:47,104 --> 01:15:50,997
But we need Siddu to sign the papers.

920
01:15:51,955 --> 01:15:53,568
I don't know where he is.

921
01:15:53,653 --> 01:15:57,433
You don't know?
- His friend said he works in share market..

922
01:15:57,724 --> 01:16:00,256
..but I don't think so.

923
01:16:00,412 --> 01:16:03,643
Mostly, he must be a master
chef in another pizza shop.

924
01:16:03,728 --> 01:16:05,078
Correct.

925
01:16:06,272 --> 01:16:10,507
Seeing his beard, I think
he is a poet or a painter, isn't it?

926
01:16:10,592 --> 01:16:11,825
What do you feel?

927
01:16:13,077 --> 01:16:18,642
My friends told me to ask what you do.

928
01:16:19,818 --> 01:16:23,439
Not me, my friends were asking so.

929
01:16:23,817 --> 01:16:27,499
Job is not the only thing that matters.

930
01:16:30,801 --> 01:16:32,480
Anything else?

931
01:16:34,524 --> 01:16:37,132
Okay, Siddu. I shall leave.

932
01:16:37,407 --> 01:16:39,654
If you are free,
shall we meet at 6 o'clock?

933
01:16:40,066 --> 01:16:41,745
Okay.

934
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:44,709
By the way..

935
01:16:46,627 --> 01:16:47,982
..what do you do?

936
01:16:48,067 --> 01:16:49,854
What did he say for that?

937
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:53,714
If I answer this question I will
have to answer a hundred more questions.

938
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:55,955
For time being,
don't ask me anything about it.

939
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,197
I am not able to understand him.

940
01:16:58,343 --> 01:17:00,172
Why should you understand him?

941
01:17:00,257 --> 01:17:01,723
It is I who should understand him.

942
01:17:02,554 --> 01:17:04,556
Had he liked his job..

943
01:17:04,641 --> 01:17:07,192
..he would've told me about it.

944
01:17:07,277 --> 01:17:11,020
I think he is not happy with his job..

945
01:17:11,105 --> 01:17:13,347
..so, he must be doing a small job.

946
01:17:13,432 --> 01:17:16,897
He does some or the
other work for survival.

947
01:17:17,622 --> 01:17:19,564
I am glad he is not a beggar.

948
01:17:20,154 --> 01:17:22,893
The person who delivers newspapers
is called delivery boy, - Yes.

949
01:17:22,978 --> 01:17:24,849
The person who delivers
milk is called milkman. - Yes.

950
01:17:24,934 --> 01:17:26,815
So the person who gives alms
should be called beggar, isn't it?

951
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,242
Why do people call us beggars?

952
01:17:29,671 --> 01:17:31,448
Is this enough?
- It's a wonderful idea.

953
01:17:31,589 --> 01:17:33,469
You are still not ready?

954
01:17:33,554 --> 01:17:35,997
We're getting late.
- I am not coming. You carry on.

955
01:17:36,117 --> 01:17:39,388
Look, you're a special
man amongst all of us.

956
01:17:39,857 --> 01:17:42,408
You look charming even
if you're begging for alms.

957
01:17:42,493 --> 01:17:44,546
So, walk decently..

958
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:46,999
..and we will follow you.

959
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:49,015
We are ready.

960
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,066
Am I right?

961
01:17:51,306 --> 01:17:53,566
I believe you won't let me down.

962
01:17:53,651 --> 01:17:55,086
If not for my sake,
at least for them.

963
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,755
Look at him. he's so old.

964
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,222
He won't live long.

965
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:00,554
Won't you fulfill his last wish? Please.

966
01:18:00,797 --> 01:18:02,373
Let's go. We're getting late.

967
01:18:03,981 --> 01:18:06,012
There will be girls in the wedding..

968
01:18:06,097 --> 01:18:07,691
..I use this only when I am on duty.

969
01:18:08,076 --> 01:18:09,093
It's a secret.

970
01:18:09,178 --> 01:18:12,251
Are you related to the bride or the groom?

971
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:14,869
Greetings. Welcome.
- Greetings.

972
01:18:15,135 --> 01:18:17,338
Welcome, sir. How are you?
- I am fine.

973
01:18:17,423 --> 01:18:19,661
When did you come back from abroad?
How is your mother?

974
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:27,614
I am glad.
You have brought your friends along..

975
01:18:27,699 --> 01:18:29,298
..you must surely eat feast.

976
01:18:29,519 --> 01:18:31,254
The auspicious period is passing by,
please come.

977
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,285
Come.
- Take them inside.

978
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,132
There are empty seats, send the guests.

979
01:18:42,881 --> 01:18:46,157
You haven't served sweet to him, bring it.

980
01:18:46,524 --> 01:18:48,235
Take your time.

981
01:18:50,369 --> 01:18:52,466
Have you served them everything?

982
01:18:52,962 --> 01:18:54,831
Look here. Bring the snacks.

983
01:18:57,715 --> 01:19:01,200
Buddy, why are you
thinking instead of eating?

984
01:19:01,285 --> 01:19:02,627
Do you want meat?

985
01:19:03,941 --> 01:19:06,938
I think I have him in my hometown.

986
01:19:07,023 --> 01:19:08,767
You haven't served potatoes fry to him.

987
01:19:08,939 --> 01:19:12,185
He is the owner of Manjunath Oil,
isn't he?

988
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:16,077
What? Him?
- Serve him fritters.

989
01:19:16,162 --> 01:19:17,644
Does he look like
the owner of an oil mill?

990
01:19:17,729 --> 01:19:19,632
You fool. He is a beggar too.

991
01:19:19,717 --> 01:19:21,044
He is from 2011 batch.

992
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:24,256
He begs for alms at the
temple near the bus stop.

993
01:19:24,341 --> 01:19:25,485
Is it him?

994
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,896
Do you know the person standing there?

995
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:31,441
Seeing his attitude,
I think he's from the groom's family.

996
01:19:31,652 --> 01:19:32,971
Some of them are beggars.

997
01:19:33,056 --> 01:19:34,762
Is that so? - We didn't enquire
before letting them inside.

998
01:19:35,662 --> 01:19:38,223
You're how many beggars?

999
01:19:38,308 --> 01:19:39,864
Beggars.

1000
01:19:40,029 --> 01:19:42,280
How dare you sneak into
a wedding and have feast?

1001
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:45,779
Get up.
- Sir, they are eating food.

1002
01:19:46,421 --> 01:19:48,185
Please be quiet for some time.

1003
01:19:48,391 --> 01:19:51,088
Will you leave or should we drag you out?

1004
01:19:51,173 --> 01:19:53,565
What?
- Okay, sir.

1005
01:19:55,822 --> 01:19:58,242
Please wait, sir.

1006
01:20:03,317 --> 01:20:06,103
Get up. Get up all of you.

1007
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:09,040
Come. Come.

1008
01:20:28,501 --> 01:20:30,724
Siddu, get up.

1009
01:20:33,406 --> 01:20:36,304
Thieves. So many of you.

1010
01:20:36,389 --> 01:20:37,927
How dare they?

1011
01:20:38,012 --> 01:20:39,910
What did you say?
- I said 'thieves'.

1012
01:20:39,995 --> 01:20:41,158
Hey!
- Hey!

1013
01:20:41,243 --> 01:20:43,063
Beat him!
- Stop it!

1014
01:20:43,148 --> 01:20:44,530
Beat him!

1015
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:47,565
Sir, please leave him.

1016
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,113
Sir, please leave him.

1017
01:20:50,543 --> 01:20:51,945
What they did is wrong.

1018
01:20:52,249 --> 01:20:53,450
What you did is right.

1019
01:20:53,826 --> 01:20:58,322
They have become beggars in
this birth because of their bad deeds.

1020
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,956
They wished to sit with
good people like you and eat food..

1021
01:21:04,322 --> 01:21:06,864
..they shouldn't be thrashed,
but put to gallows.

1022
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:13,601
You don't protest against
the corrupt politicians..

1023
01:21:13,977 --> 01:21:18,638
..but you thrashed those who
came here to eat just one square..

1024
01:21:18,723 --> 01:21:20,599
..you are good people.

1025
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,243
It is just one square meal for you..

1026
01:21:23,586 --> 01:21:29,641
..but they think that they are
fortunate to get even one square meal.

1027
01:21:29,805 --> 01:21:33,811
He is an old man,
but thrashed him as if he is your enemy.

1028
01:21:34,969 --> 01:21:36,132
Remember one thing.

1029
01:21:36,493 --> 01:21:40,594
You and I have a common
and a permanent enemy.

1030
01:21:42,046 --> 01:21:44,302
It is hunger.

1031
01:21:44,476 --> 01:21:48,556
They came here to eat
food because they were hungry.

1032
01:21:48,762 --> 01:21:51,806
Please forgive them.

1033
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:57,518
Let's go.

1034
01:21:57,785 --> 01:21:59,483
Sir, who are you?
- Come.

1035
01:22:01,435 --> 01:22:02,912
I am one of them.

1036
01:22:04,056 --> 01:22:05,116
I am a beggar.

1037
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:07,475
Come.

1038
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:02,506
Sir, they picked up fight with me first..

1039
01:24:02,647 --> 01:24:05,723
..and they have kidnapped me today.

1040
01:24:05,996 --> 01:24:07,417
I am innocent.

1041
01:24:07,554 --> 01:24:09,299
Ask them yourself.

1042
01:24:13,877 --> 01:24:16,175
Okay. I will ask them.

1043
01:24:19,156 --> 01:24:22,960
Why did you kidnap him?

1044
01:24:28,242 --> 01:24:30,971
It was I who ordered them..

1045
01:24:31,741 --> 01:24:33,645
..to thrash you..

1046
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:35,657
..and bring you here.

1047
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:57,011
Me too.

1048
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:02,522
I wanted to know who sent them..

1049
01:25:02,714 --> 01:25:05,613
..that's why I got thrashed
by them and came here.

1050
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:08,004
I won't thrash them..

1051
01:25:08,165 --> 01:25:10,904
..I will thrash only you.

1052
01:25:19,265 --> 01:25:23,477
He said he will thrash me in front of you.

1053
01:25:23,683 --> 01:25:25,418
Let's see.

1054
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:29,348
Let's see who will thrash whom.

1055
01:25:29,718 --> 01:25:31,186
Move back.

1056
01:25:32,054 --> 01:25:34,099
No one should intervene, beware.

1057
01:26:19,676 --> 01:26:20,861
Oh, my God.

1058
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:52,590
Our boss is getting thrashed. Let's flee.

1059
01:27:14,365 --> 01:27:16,063
Beware!

1060
01:27:37,488 --> 01:27:40,095
Boss!
- Boss!

1061
01:27:52,566 --> 01:27:54,705
Are you out of your mind?

1062
01:27:55,164 --> 01:27:57,635
Our men got thrashed by a beggar..

1063
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:01,669
..and you are laughing at them.

1064
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:36,828
Let it be, boss.
My stomach is aching.

1065
01:28:38,164 --> 01:28:41,171
I am not able to control my laugh.

1066
01:28:42,582 --> 01:28:44,829
Shall I laugh once, boss? Please.

1067
01:28:45,148 --> 01:28:46,597
Please, boss.

1068
01:28:48,443 --> 01:28:49,836
Okay, boss.

1069
01:28:50,371 --> 01:28:51,567
Please, boss.

1070
01:29:00,546 --> 01:29:04,059
Hey! Is it funny to you?

1071
01:29:10,654 --> 01:29:13,253
'He does some or the
other work for survival.'

1072
01:29:14,069 --> 01:29:15,734
'I am glad he is not a beggar.'

1073
01:29:20,687 --> 01:29:21,930
Ma'am, give me food.

1074
01:29:22,184 --> 01:29:25,585
Don't you have festival offers.
- Sir, curry free on 'Idli'.

1075
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:27,148
You're very smart.

1076
01:29:27,917 --> 01:29:29,309
The food was tasty.

1077
01:29:29,394 --> 01:29:32,959
Having food stomach full makes us content.

1078
01:29:34,549 --> 01:29:36,912
Siddu, someone is missing you.

1079
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:37,949
Be quiet.

1080
01:29:38,034 --> 01:29:41,758
If that's true then Sunny
Leone would die of hiccups.

1081
01:29:42,133 --> 01:29:44,253
I miss her too.

1082
01:29:44,511 --> 01:29:46,514
Actually...

1083
01:29:48,695 --> 01:29:51,542
Siddu, look there. Didn't I tell you?

1084
01:29:54,998 --> 01:29:57,638
Why are you getting hiccups?
No one misses you.

1085
01:29:57,812 --> 01:29:59,064
Let's go.

1086
01:29:59,149 --> 01:30:00,632
I will find a girl too.

1087
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,207
Bindu.
- Yes.

1088
01:30:16,573 --> 01:30:17,970
Bindu.

1089
01:30:18,101 --> 01:30:21,431
Ma'am, give him alms else he won't leave.

1090
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:22,626
He won't go.

1091
01:30:34,778 --> 01:30:36,241
Hey!

1092
01:30:39,516 --> 01:30:40,693
Stop looking at me.

1093
01:30:40,778 --> 01:30:43,123
You should convince me when I am angry..

1094
01:30:43,245 --> 01:30:46,317
..but you just don't care. Darn it.

1095
01:30:46,856 --> 01:30:48,578
Look at the clothes you are wearing.

1096
01:30:50,828 --> 01:30:54,158
Look, listen to me. Come with me..

1097
01:30:54,487 --> 01:30:56,045
..work in our restaurant.

1098
01:30:56,377 --> 01:30:57,709
Handle the cash department.

1099
01:30:58,070 --> 01:31:01,194
If you don't like it,
I will get you another job..

1100
01:31:01,803 --> 01:31:04,538
..but stop begging, please.

1101
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:07,999
Sorry. I can't do that.
- Why?

1102
01:31:10,283 --> 01:31:11,812
Won't you tell me?

1103
01:31:13,759 --> 01:31:20,403
'Under any circumstances nobody
must know who you are for those 48 days.'

1104
01:31:21,863 --> 01:31:23,303
I can't tell you.

1105
01:31:24,786 --> 01:31:27,769
Oh, I am still not close to you, isn't it?

1106
01:31:29,064 --> 01:31:30,269
I am a fool.

1107
01:31:30,354 --> 01:31:34,087
Without trying to know who you are,
I fell in love...

1108
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:43,948
I mean you're my good friend.

1109
01:31:44,685 --> 01:31:47,035
Look, don't tell anything about me.

1110
01:31:47,246 --> 01:31:49,699
We're not school or college mates..

1111
01:31:50,014 --> 01:31:52,425
..nor you're my maternal
cousin to tell me your secret.

1112
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:55,576
Bye.

1113
01:32:00,267 --> 01:32:02,119
'I can't tell you.'

1114
01:32:08,855 --> 01:32:10,993
You're CBI officer, right?

1115
01:32:11,919 --> 01:32:15,188
Are you on a secret assignment?
- Well...

1116
01:32:21,143 --> 01:32:23,638
You said you're a beggar,
pick that up..

1117
01:32:23,765 --> 01:32:25,472
..and get lost.

1118
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:43,759
Hey.
- Yes.

1119
01:32:43,918 --> 01:32:47,619
We can make good money on
the festival day in Dharmastala.

1120
01:32:47,834 --> 01:32:48,805
Get ready.

1121
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:50,423
We will stay in Dharmastale for one week.

1122
01:32:50,508 --> 01:32:52,647
Shall I book air conditioned
berths for all of them?

1123
01:32:54,443 --> 01:32:57,793
'Usually, large number of devotees..

1124
01:32:57,878 --> 01:33:02,092
..visit Chamundi Hills during
festival times or during holidays..

1125
01:33:02,256 --> 01:33:05,127
..but today is not festival nor holiday..

1126
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:09,086
..but hundreds of female devotees
have paid visit to Chamundi Hills.'

1127
01:33:09,171 --> 01:33:10,769
'Do you know the reason?'

1128
01:33:10,854 --> 01:33:14,221
'Our correspondent Sunaina
from Chamundi Hills.'

1129
01:33:14,306 --> 01:33:18,976
'The owner of the company where
these women work is ill past several days.'

1130
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:23,136
'Therefore, they have come to offer
prayers for her. Interesting, isn't it?'

1131
01:33:23,221 --> 01:33:24,952
'Come, let's talk to them.'

1132
01:33:25,037 --> 01:33:27,521
'Do you have so much respect towards Ms.
Annapoorneshwari?'

1133
01:33:27,606 --> 01:33:30,270
'She is observing silence.
- Then you speak.'

1134
01:33:30,448 --> 01:33:33,317
'It is said that God examines good people,
it is true.'

1135
01:33:33,437 --> 01:33:35,272
'Our madam is getting
my younger brother educated..'

1136
01:33:35,357 --> 01:33:37,646
'..in the college where her son
studied in abroad.'

1137
01:33:37,731 --> 01:33:40,117
'Is that so?'

1138
01:33:40,202 --> 01:33:41,468
'Not only her brother's education..'

1139
01:33:41,553 --> 01:33:44,060
'..she finds out the problem of
every employee working..'

1140
01:33:44,145 --> 01:33:46,153
'..in her company and helps them.'

1141
01:33:46,815 --> 01:33:50,108
'Ma'am, you climbed the hills
for your madam's speedy recovery...'

1142
01:33:50,193 --> 01:33:51,561
'She's not my boss.'

1143
01:33:51,846 --> 01:33:53,183
'She is like my daughter.'

1144
01:33:53,319 --> 01:33:56,870
'I will not only climb his
hill for my daughter's recovery..'

1145
01:33:56,955 --> 01:33:58,909
'..I am ready to even lay down my life.'

1146
01:33:58,994 --> 01:34:01,808
'Why only women have come?'

1147
01:34:01,893 --> 01:34:03,904
'Don't men work in your company?'

1148
01:34:03,989 --> 01:34:06,507
'Our boss's son is not in town..'

1149
01:34:06,755 --> 01:34:09,503
'..and the male employees have to
look after the company until he is back..'

1150
01:34:09,588 --> 01:34:12,764
'..therefore,
no male employee can take leave.'

1151
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,496
'You saw for yourself, viewers.'

1152
01:34:14,581 --> 01:34:19,933
'For those who think factory
is all about business..'

1153
01:34:20,018 --> 01:34:25,605
'..the bonding between the owner
and the employees is an example to them.'

1154
01:34:25,767 --> 01:34:27,259
Hello.
- Hello.

1155
01:34:27,344 --> 01:34:28,709
Rajesh.
- Siddu.

1156
01:34:28,867 --> 01:34:30,790
I saw our workers on television.

1157
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:34,400
I was about to sell the
factory in which they work.

1158
01:34:34,559 --> 01:34:36,572
We must do something for them.

1159
01:34:36,657 --> 01:34:38,026
That's a good thought.

1160
01:34:38,405 --> 01:34:39,725
What should we do?

1161
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:47,291
Seth, what did you pray to God?

1162
01:34:47,567 --> 01:34:49,790
Did you pray for fast
registration of the factory..

1163
01:34:49,875 --> 01:34:51,873
..or for your wife who fled?

1164
01:34:52,558 --> 01:34:53,890
Not both, sir.

1165
01:34:53,975 --> 01:34:55,487
I prayed to God that..

1166
01:34:55,572 --> 01:35:00,001
..there should be no shortage in the
commission money that you pay me.

1167
01:35:03,822 --> 01:35:05,534
Your phone is ringing.

1168
01:35:05,985 --> 01:35:07,444
Hello.

1169
01:35:25,209 --> 01:35:28,661
Seth, my younger brother's son is begging.

1170
01:35:31,904 --> 01:35:33,573
I am telling you something serious..

1171
01:35:33,733 --> 01:35:35,266
..and you look sullen?

1172
01:35:35,557 --> 01:35:36,682
Who called?

1173
01:35:37,237 --> 01:35:39,835
Factory manager Rajesh called.
- What did he say?

1174
01:35:40,182 --> 01:35:43,207
Siddu has instructed not
to sell both the factories.

1175
01:35:43,555 --> 01:35:45,520
Not to sell them?
- Yes.

1176
01:35:46,191 --> 01:35:47,851
He is begging for alms here.

1177
01:35:48,225 --> 01:35:50,641
Marappa, keep this in the car.

1178
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:53,372
Okay, sir.
- Marappa, come here.

1179
01:35:53,882 --> 01:35:55,997
Yes, sir.
- I have counted the fruits.

1180
01:35:56,082 --> 01:35:59,196
Okay.
- Three apples, three oranges..

1181
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:01,865
..two pomegranates, 17 bananas..

1182
01:36:02,414 --> 01:36:03,592
..and one garland.

1183
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,771
Even if one fruit goes missing,
I won't spare you. Go.

1184
01:36:08,586 --> 01:36:10,106
Okay, sir.

1185
01:36:10,988 --> 01:36:12,147
Seth.
- Yes.

1186
01:36:12,549 --> 01:36:13,952
Follow me.

1187
01:36:17,774 --> 01:36:20,171
I saw him right here.
- Where?

1188
01:36:20,599 --> 01:36:21,954
You search there

1189
01:36:22,039 --> 01:36:24,014
I will search here.
- Okay.

1190
01:36:30,115 --> 01:36:31,887
Ma'am!

1191
01:36:32,015 --> 01:36:34,529
Please give me alms.

1192
01:36:37,028 --> 01:36:39,368
Did you find him?
- No, sir.

1193
01:36:39,453 --> 01:36:40,747
He is not to be seen anywhere.

1194
01:36:41,666 --> 01:36:46,173
Are you sure you saw
him or are you mistaken?

1195
01:36:47,673 --> 01:36:50,618
If you say that, I will order
Marappa to ram the car into you.

1196
01:36:51,021 --> 01:36:52,428
Do you think I am mad?

1197
01:36:53,113 --> 01:36:55,828
Let's go. - All right.
- Shut up.

1198
01:36:57,569 --> 01:37:00,815
Why would a billionaire beg for alms?

1199
01:37:01,411 --> 01:37:02,804
There can be two reasons.

1200
01:37:03,262 --> 01:37:07,197
He must've made a vow or he must be mad.

1201
01:37:08,495 --> 01:37:09,860
It must be a vow.

1202
01:37:10,578 --> 01:37:14,437
He must be begging
for his mother recovery.

1203
01:37:18,011 --> 01:37:21,299
There will be number of
days to fulfill the vow, right?

1204
01:37:21,384 --> 01:37:23,330
Well...
- Some follow it for 48 days..

1205
01:37:23,415 --> 01:37:24,883
..some follow it for 108 days.

1206
01:37:24,968 --> 01:37:27,050
It depends on the kind of
vow people make.

1207
01:37:27,135 --> 01:37:29,747
Why? Do you want to make a vow, sir?

1208
01:37:34,327 --> 01:37:36,837
It's him. There's a girl with him..

1209
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:38,441
..I want both of them.

1210
01:37:38,633 --> 01:37:40,153
What is the matter?

1211
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,806
Wrong things happen in that hospital.

1212
01:37:44,595 --> 01:37:48,961
Since mentally retarded
patients don't understand anything..

1213
01:37:49,256 --> 01:37:51,615
..they conduct tests on them.

1214
01:37:51,738 --> 01:37:53,862
Doctors from abroad visit the hospital.

1215
01:37:54,388 --> 01:37:56,891
They talk about their
wrong doings thinking..

1216
01:37:56,976 --> 01:37:59,693
..I am mad and I wouldn't
understand anything.

1217
01:37:59,778 --> 01:38:02,173
New medicines invented
by the foreigners..

1218
01:38:02,258 --> 01:38:06,906
..are tested on the patients
there if it works properly or not.

1219
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:09,198
Overdose is given on me too.

1220
01:38:09,283 --> 01:38:13,325
The patients develop new
disease everyday..

1221
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:16,642
..and die a terrible death.

1222
01:38:19,658 --> 01:38:20,882
Catch her!

1223
01:38:27,923 --> 01:38:29,326
50 lakhs advance.

1224
01:38:29,739 --> 01:38:31,263
I will pay the rest of
the money after you finish them.

1225
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:46,140
Didn't they find anybody else?

1226
01:38:54,478 --> 01:38:56,110
I will give you double the money..

1227
01:38:56,635 --> 01:38:58,216
..after you finish him.

1228
01:39:10,713 --> 01:39:15,637
He didn't spend a single
penny to save his wife.

1229
01:39:16,393 --> 01:39:20,051
But now, he has even paid
advance money.

1230
01:39:20,453 --> 01:39:21,804
Who is he?

1231
01:39:22,297 --> 01:39:26,738
The doctor and that miser paid
money on the same day to finish him.

1232
01:39:27,071 --> 01:39:29,294
Have you seen him?

1233
01:39:30,205 --> 01:39:34,191
Boss, it was he who caused
this injury on his face.

1234
01:39:34,332 --> 01:39:35,809
What?
- Yes.

1235
01:39:35,983 --> 01:39:37,793
Is he a hooligan?

1236
01:39:38,277 --> 01:39:41,058
Where does he hail from? Is he from
this city or from Mumbai or from Bihar?

1237
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,300
No, boss.

1238
01:39:43,988 --> 01:39:45,635
Then?
- He is a beggar.

1239
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:48,054
What? A beggar?

1240
01:39:48,496 --> 01:39:53,261
Ritu, a beggar has thrashed our men..

1241
01:39:53,556 --> 01:39:56,699
..and you did nothing.
You should've killed him.

1242
01:39:56,896 --> 01:39:58,613
Boss.
- Yes.

1243
01:39:58,805 --> 01:40:01,445
He thrashed him more.

1244
01:40:05,253 --> 01:40:07,087
Why do I call you 'Right'?

1245
01:40:07,542 --> 01:40:08,606
Answer me.

1246
01:40:10,642 --> 01:40:11,720
You answer me.

1247
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:16,997
Because we report to
him during your absence.

1248
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,394
Correct.

1249
01:40:20,444 --> 01:40:23,093
Hereafter, call him 'Left'.

1250
01:40:25,677 --> 01:40:27,520
Come on.
- Left.

1251
01:40:27,717 --> 01:40:29,879
Yes.
- Left.

1252
01:40:30,418 --> 01:40:32,838
Left!

1253
01:40:33,036 --> 01:40:35,883
Do you know why I named you Left?

1254
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:39,288
You don't fit for hooliganism.

1255
01:40:48,546 --> 01:40:52,224
Akshara. - Okay, I will bake later.
- I have kept it here.

1256
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:56,079
Akshara, one veggie,
one fry, with cheese. - Okay.

1257
01:40:57,254 --> 01:40:59,716
Look, if you can't forget him..

1258
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:02,516
..even you beg for alms
sitting on a platform.

1259
01:41:05,418 --> 01:41:06,722
I am getting angry.

1260
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:09,044
I am getting very angry..

1261
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:13,029
..but I don't understand
if I am angry on him or myself.

1262
01:41:14,253 --> 01:41:17,034
I am not able to forget him.

1263
01:41:18,831 --> 01:41:22,330
Along with anger, I also feel like crying.

1264
01:41:28,727 --> 01:41:31,498
Come.
Our boss has given Biryani, take it.

1265
01:41:31,719 --> 01:41:32,896
Enjoy yourselves.

1266
01:41:32,981 --> 01:41:35,236
They have brought food, come fast.

1267
01:41:37,238 --> 01:41:40,029
The one talking to the crippled,
it's him.

1268
01:41:41,075 --> 01:41:43,055
It's very tasty.

1269
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:45,759
It's him?

1270
01:41:46,341 --> 01:41:47,837
'50 lakhs advance.'

1271
01:41:47,922 --> 01:41:50,768
'I will pay you double
the money after you finish him.'

1272
01:42:01,203 --> 01:42:03,881
Boss, we should've finished him by now.

1273
01:42:26,055 --> 01:42:27,795
Siddu...

1274
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:50,162
How dare you beat my men?

1275
01:42:54,593 --> 01:42:55,864
A beggar.

1276
01:42:59,278 --> 01:43:01,595
No chance.

1277
01:43:03,686 --> 01:43:06,102
There is no way..

1278
01:43:06,584 --> 01:43:09,033
..that a beggar could..

1279
01:43:10,712 --> 01:43:12,536
..thrash goons so badly.

1280
01:43:12,681 --> 01:43:15,284
Tell me. Who are you?

1281
01:43:26,901 --> 01:43:28,819
Where do you hail from? Tell me.

1282
01:43:29,237 --> 01:43:30,841
Tell me.

1283
01:43:37,008 --> 01:43:41,558
'Under any circumstances nobody
must know who you are for those 48 days.'

1284
01:43:41,698 --> 01:43:43,738
Tell me, I will let you go.

1285
01:43:43,972 --> 01:43:45,961
Tell me as you are alive.

1286
01:43:47,344 --> 01:43:49,098
Come on, tell me.

1287
01:43:49,342 --> 01:43:50,670
Tell me.

1288
01:43:53,052 --> 01:43:54,511
Who are you?

1289
01:43:55,223 --> 01:43:56,560
Who are you?

1290
01:43:57,204 --> 01:43:58,362
Who are you?

1291
01:44:00,056 --> 01:44:02,363
How dare you thrash my men?

1292
01:44:19,805 --> 01:44:23,623
Left, after he gets up, thrash him..

1293
01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:26,063
..and ask him where that mad girl is..

1294
01:44:26,148 --> 01:44:27,869
..let's deal with the rest later.

1295
01:44:28,454 --> 01:44:30,157
Why are you looking at me like that?

1296
01:44:30,307 --> 01:44:32,075
Do you want to get thrashed again?

1297
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:33,623
Tie him up.

1298
01:44:57,030 --> 01:44:58,784
They will be looking for me.

1299
01:44:59,117 --> 01:45:02,021
If I am with you,
you will be in danger too.

1300
01:45:02,447 --> 01:45:04,033
I will stay alone for a few days..

1301
01:45:04,352 --> 01:45:06,129
..I myself will contact you.

1302
01:45:06,481 --> 01:45:08,807
Geeta, do you remember what I said?
- Yes.

1303
01:45:09,595 --> 01:45:11,339
Take her to the news channel.

1304
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:14,430
I will come, okay?
- Buddy. - Yes.

1305
01:45:16,419 --> 01:45:18,910
Here, take this phone.
- Thanks.

1306
01:45:19,037 --> 01:45:20,312
Bye.

1307
01:45:25,215 --> 01:45:28,019
Ma'am, I am a blind man
who doesn't have eyesight.

1308
01:45:28,104 --> 01:45:30,058
Those who don't have eyesight
are called blind people only.

1309
01:45:30,143 --> 01:45:32,861
People, please give me alms.

1310
01:45:32,946 --> 01:45:34,369
I am unemployed.

1311
01:45:34,454 --> 01:45:36,033
I am unemployed.

1312
01:45:36,197 --> 01:45:38,918
Ma'am!
- Sir! Nobody is responding.

1313
01:45:39,003 --> 01:45:41,714
I think people have no
money after demonetization.

1314
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:44,107
Sir, have you seen him anywhere?

1315
01:45:44,489 --> 01:45:46,652
No.
- Move back.

1316
01:45:46,787 --> 01:45:48,915
Have you seen him?
- Yes.

1317
01:45:49,068 --> 01:45:51,425
Where?
- In the photograph.

1318
01:45:52,672 --> 01:45:54,107
Sir!
- Ma'am!

1319
01:45:54,192 --> 01:45:56,124
I am a beggar who is blind.

1320
01:45:56,209 --> 01:45:58,238
Please give me alms.

1321
01:45:58,373 --> 01:45:59,761
Please give me alms.

1322
01:45:59,846 --> 01:46:03,996
You pretend to be a blind man.

1323
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,571
If people find out,
they will thrash us. Get up.

1324
01:46:06,656 --> 01:46:08,568
Get up.
- Get up.

1325
01:46:08,698 --> 01:46:10,555
Get up. Get lost.
- Get up.

1326
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,127
Get lost.
- Get lost.

1327
01:46:12,258 --> 01:46:14,307
Get lost.
- Sit quietly. He's gone.

1328
01:46:14,392 --> 01:46:16,422
Okay. Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

1329
01:46:18,027 --> 01:46:19,025
Who are you?

1330
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:21,060
Why are you seeing us and
then the photograph? Who are you?

1331
01:46:21,145 --> 01:46:22,439
I am a beggar too.

1332
01:46:22,524 --> 01:46:24,606
Look. Ma'am!

1333
01:46:24,691 --> 01:46:27,402
I beg just like you. - How much money
did you make since morning?

1334
01:46:27,487 --> 01:46:29,329
Sir, this place is unlucky..

1335
01:46:29,414 --> 01:46:30,848
..that's why nobody give alms to me.

1336
01:46:30,933 --> 01:46:33,780
Nobody is giving us
alms because of you.

1337
01:46:34,234 --> 01:46:35,416
I smell something.

1338
01:46:35,501 --> 01:46:40,326
What's in the bag? Show me.
- Sir, nothing.

1339
01:46:42,807 --> 01:46:44,247
Have you come here for nuptial night?

1340
01:46:44,372 --> 01:46:46,277
You beg for alms spraying scent?

1341
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:49,578
I will...
- Catch him! Stop!

1342
01:46:49,986 --> 01:46:53,953
We also became beggars like
him the moment he thrashed us.

1343
01:46:54,038 --> 01:46:57,453
My wife went to her maternal house leaving
me because I got threshed by a beggar..

1344
01:46:57,612 --> 01:47:00,187
..now, if she finds out
that I have become a beggar..

1345
01:47:00,272 --> 01:47:01,640
..she will divorce me.

1346
01:47:01,725 --> 01:47:03,422
My body is itching.

1347
01:47:03,633 --> 01:47:04,932
Listen to my problem.

1348
01:47:05,017 --> 01:47:08,028
When I asked the beggar
for this shirt and pant..

1349
01:47:08,113 --> 01:47:10,510
..he showed no mercy towards me.

1350
01:47:11,068 --> 01:47:13,886
Why?
- He took Rs. 1080 for this.

1351
01:47:14,211 --> 01:47:15,486
Rs. 1080?

1352
01:47:15,571 --> 01:47:18,381
I was shocked too, and when I asked
him the same, do you know what he said?

1353
01:47:18,466 --> 01:47:21,326
What did he say? - Rs. 1000
for the clothes and Rs. 80 as GST.

1354
01:47:22,818 --> 01:47:24,614
The smell is unbearable.

1355
01:47:24,699 --> 01:47:26,438
Take it off.
- What?

1356
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:28,914
The clothes.
- I will do it at once.

1357
01:47:28,999 --> 01:47:30,471
Take it off.

1358
01:47:30,556 --> 01:47:32,230
Sir, please give me alms.

1359
01:47:32,315 --> 01:47:34,889
We're already annoyed,
don't annoy us more.

1360
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:37,595
You're begging for alms by
tying the cloth to your left hand today..

1361
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,381
..yesterday, you were begging for alms
by tying the cloth to your right hand.

1362
01:47:40,466 --> 01:47:42,384
We know you beggars are fraud.

1363
01:47:42,469 --> 01:47:46,235
Get going.
- Do you think you're policeman?

1364
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,250
Yesterday, he was sitting
on the cart and he was pushing it..

1365
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:50,420
..today, I am sitting on
the cart and he is pushing it.

1366
01:47:50,738 --> 01:47:53,430
You couldn't know even that
and you try to act smart with us.

1367
01:47:53,515 --> 01:47:55,161
Get going.
- Get going. Push me.

1368
01:47:55,246 --> 01:47:56,705
Give way.
- Get lost.

1369
01:48:01,212 --> 01:48:03,135
Coffee.

1370
01:48:04,119 --> 01:48:05,498
Take it.

1371
01:48:09,948 --> 01:48:12,392
I am not enjoying the rain today, mom.

1372
01:48:13,241 --> 01:48:15,079
What are you saying?

1373
01:48:15,455 --> 01:48:17,800
I am quite shocked.

1374
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,317
Why? Any problem?

1375
01:48:23,794 --> 01:48:25,942
Can I go out alone for a while?

1376
01:49:23,806 --> 01:49:25,095
Raincoat.

1377
01:49:38,253 --> 01:49:39,580
Bindu.

1378
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:57,659
Won't you accept even this?

1379
01:49:58,225 --> 01:49:59,765
Why?

1380
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:06,674
I can't accept it.

1381
01:50:09,258 --> 01:50:10,459
Siddu.

1382
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:13,343
Will you accept it if I give it as alms?

1383
01:51:22,669 --> 01:51:25,892
'Rajesh, I won't be in
town for the next 48 days.'

1384
01:51:26,125 --> 01:51:28,388
'Look after everything until I am back.'

1385
01:51:39,085 --> 01:51:41,303
Bindu, I have a doubt.

1386
01:51:41,388 --> 01:51:43,287
Do you take selfie
after you both become close..

1387
01:51:43,372 --> 01:51:46,111
..or become close after taking selfie.

1388
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:48,697
I think I have seen him somewhere.

1389
01:51:49,412 --> 01:51:50,699
Wait a minute.

1390
01:51:54,444 --> 01:51:56,508
What is his name?
- Siddu.

1391
01:51:57,281 --> 01:51:58,491
Siddu.

1392
01:52:00,847 --> 01:52:03,036
His full name is Siddharth Shivkumar.

1393
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:07,352
He is the only son of the owner of..

1394
01:52:07,437 --> 01:52:09,526
..Annapoorneshwari Group of
Companies, Bangalore.

1395
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:12,091
He completed MBA abroad.

1396
01:52:12,176 --> 01:52:16,266
Since his matrimonial profile
said 'money is not important..'

1397
01:52:16,351 --> 01:52:18,865
..I had sent your photograph
to him 7-8 months ago.

1398
01:52:19,053 --> 01:52:20,868
I don't know what happened after that.

1399
01:52:21,153 --> 01:52:22,663
He didn't reply.

1400
01:52:22,855 --> 01:52:24,628
That's why I didn't tell him.

1401
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:32,713
Three goons came..

1402
01:52:33,243 --> 01:52:35,330
..enquired about you..

1403
01:52:35,672 --> 01:52:37,486
..I said 'I don't know'..

1404
01:52:37,571 --> 01:52:39,015
..so they thrashed me.

1405
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:45,301
We had gathered money to commence
a small business they took the money too.

1406
01:52:52,436 --> 01:52:55,260
Buddy, the hero of the English film...

1407
01:52:55,522 --> 01:52:57,623
He is out of his mind.

1408
01:52:57,918 --> 01:52:59,986
Was it them?
- Yes.

1409
01:53:08,175 --> 01:53:11,195
How dare you loot poor people?

1410
01:53:11,476 --> 01:53:14,281
Give back the money. Come on.

1411
01:53:15,638 --> 01:53:17,157
Come on.

1412
01:53:21,996 --> 01:53:22,990
Take it.

1413
01:53:23,445 --> 01:53:25,017
God bless you.

1414
01:53:28,592 --> 01:53:30,360
Please leave.

1415
01:53:59,098 --> 01:54:00,781
We won't spare you.

1416
01:54:21,408 --> 01:54:22,710
Get up.

1417
01:54:30,881 --> 01:54:31,943
Come this way.

1418
01:55:35,118 --> 01:55:37,214
Get him.

1419
01:56:09,278 --> 01:56:11,534
Rajesh. Mother?

1420
01:56:11,978 --> 01:56:12,969
Mother...

1421
01:56:14,394 --> 01:56:16,334
She is battling for her life.

1422
01:56:17,373 --> 01:56:18,469
She can die...

1423
01:56:25,396 --> 01:56:27,628
Siddu, come with me.

1424
01:56:28,154 --> 01:56:29,407
What are you thinking?

1425
01:56:29,677 --> 01:56:32,206
This is not the time to think.
Come with me.

1426
01:56:35,855 --> 01:56:38,920
Oh. Did the sage manipulate so much?

1427
01:56:42,136 --> 01:56:43,715
I know everything.

1428
01:56:44,015 --> 01:56:46,248
I came here after meeting the sage.

1429
01:56:46,965 --> 01:56:50,086
If begging for alms
could cure all the diseases..

1430
01:56:50,243 --> 01:56:52,283
..in the medical colleges
across the world..

1431
01:56:52,368 --> 01:56:54,104
..students would've stopped
practicing medicine..

1432
01:56:54,349 --> 01:56:55,913
..and practiced begging.

1433
01:56:56,355 --> 01:56:59,053
If you stay like this..

1434
01:56:59,672 --> 01:57:01,120
..will your mother recover?

1435
01:57:02,306 --> 01:57:03,864
I don't know, Rajesh.

1436
01:57:05,302 --> 01:57:10,308
Many people think they
can buy everything with money..

1437
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:12,165
..but God..

1438
01:57:12,806 --> 01:57:14,926
..made me realise things very soon.

1439
01:57:16,195 --> 01:57:18,836
One can buy mattress with money..

1440
01:57:19,685 --> 01:57:22,334
..but not sleep.

1441
01:57:23,475 --> 01:57:28,218
Only after the doctors gave up hope..

1442
01:57:29,618 --> 01:57:31,460
..I took this decision.

1443
01:57:32,818 --> 01:57:34,367
I have money..

1444
01:57:35,956 --> 01:57:38,162
..but I am not able to save my mother.

1445
01:57:39,147 --> 01:57:44,211
I wish my faith will
save my mother, Rajesh.

1446
01:57:45,736 --> 01:57:47,649
If I don't do this..

1447
01:57:48,831 --> 01:57:51,801
..I will feel guilty all my life.

1448
01:57:51,886 --> 01:57:53,502
Fool!

1449
01:57:54,418 --> 01:57:56,958
Your foolishness is very evident.

1450
01:57:57,796 --> 01:58:00,922
You have been going through tough times..

1451
01:58:01,323 --> 01:58:03,634
..so your mother should've
recovered at least to an extent.

1452
01:58:03,998 --> 01:58:05,116
Why didn't it happen?

1453
01:58:05,893 --> 01:58:07,716
Her condition has become critical.

1454
01:58:08,890 --> 01:58:09,982
Try to understand.

1455
01:58:10,879 --> 01:58:13,393
You should be with her at times like this.

1456
01:58:14,049 --> 01:58:15,069
Come, let's go.

1457
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:20,828
Faith is only when you believe completely.

1458
01:58:21,744 --> 01:58:24,445
I won't come until I fulfill the vow.

1459
01:58:25,071 --> 01:58:26,542
Please don't force.

1460
01:58:26,861 --> 01:58:29,442
Okay. But let me tell you something.

1461
01:58:29,821 --> 01:58:31,506
You will regret all your life for..

1462
01:58:31,591 --> 01:58:34,638
..not staying with your mother
during her last days.

1463
01:58:35,347 --> 01:58:36,691
Then the same sage will tell you..

1464
01:58:36,892 --> 01:58:39,641
'..amongst all the problems in this world,
death is just a small thing..'

1465
01:58:39,726 --> 01:58:42,400
'..I made you beg for alms
just to make you understand that.'

1466
01:58:42,691 --> 01:58:43,900
You will then realise..

1467
01:58:44,060 --> 01:58:45,407
..that it was you..

1468
01:58:47,857 --> 01:58:49,080
..who missed your mother.

1469
01:58:50,563 --> 01:58:53,438
Rajesh, just for one night.

1470
01:58:53,850 --> 01:58:56,506
The vow will be fulfilled
tomorrow at 11 a.m...

1471
01:58:56,965 --> 01:58:59,028
..come and take me.

1472
01:59:48,024 --> 01:59:51,255
I heard you and your friend talk.

1473
01:59:51,593 --> 01:59:54,702
You're begging for
alms to save your mother..

1474
01:59:54,871 --> 01:59:58,328
..and your vow will be over tomorrow,
I heard everything.

1475
01:59:59,501 --> 02:00:01,588
That's why I am sending
you this voice message.

1476
02:00:01,673 --> 02:00:04,209
The vow will be fulfilled tomorrow.

1477
02:00:04,486 --> 02:00:06,385
I will stay with you the entire day.

1478
02:00:06,665 --> 02:00:09,470
Okay, Mr. Siddharth Shivkumar?

1479
02:00:13,391 --> 02:00:16,730
I told you he's not a beggar.

1480
02:00:17,758 --> 02:00:20,868
He is the MD of Annapoorneshwari
Group of Companies.

1481
02:00:21,229 --> 02:00:22,880
He is a billionaire.

1482
02:00:23,209 --> 02:00:26,093
He used to thrash my
men when he was a beggar..

1483
02:00:26,371 --> 02:00:28,481
..so will he spare us after
he becomes a billionaire again?

1484
02:00:28,655 --> 02:00:30,892
He will finish us.

1485
02:00:35,858 --> 02:00:37,744
You don't be scared, sir.

1486
02:00:38,499 --> 02:00:42,078
There's still 12 hours
for him to become a billionaire..

1487
02:00:42,608 --> 02:00:45,234
..but he will die as a beggar.

1488
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:52,818
Ritu.

1489
02:00:54,541 --> 02:00:56,858
What we have to do now is...

1490
02:00:57,425 --> 02:01:00,516
..If both don't get
caught by the goons today..

1491
02:01:00,675 --> 02:01:03,836
..we will land into legal trouble.
- Yes.

1492
02:01:04,449 --> 02:01:06,480
Inspector Purushotam will be inside..

1493
02:01:06,565 --> 02:01:09,195
..I have spoken to him over the phone.

1494
02:01:09,608 --> 02:01:12,296
Go inside and give the money,
mention my name.

1495
02:01:12,487 --> 02:01:14,795
That's enough.
- Okay, sir.

1496
02:01:15,409 --> 02:01:17,561
Look, you have his photograph, right?

1497
02:01:17,646 --> 02:01:22,047
Yes, sir. - The inspector doesn't
know that he is a billionaire.

1498
02:01:22,169 --> 02:01:23,660
Even you don't tell him.
- I know, sir.

1499
02:01:23,745 --> 02:01:25,833
After all, they are police.

1500
02:01:35,429 --> 02:01:37,240
What are you doing?
- Please give me alms.

1501
02:01:43,743 --> 02:01:46,044
What are you doing?
- I am begging for alms.

1502
02:01:46,381 --> 02:01:48,606
I will be with you the entire day.

1503
02:01:51,658 --> 02:01:52,659
Come.

1504
02:01:56,116 --> 02:01:57,249
Ma'am!

1505
02:02:04,558 --> 02:02:05,720
Ma'am, please give alms.

1506
02:02:05,805 --> 02:02:09,949
To you? - No, to him.
- No, sorry.

1507
02:02:11,985 --> 02:02:13,287
Sir, please give me alms.

1508
02:02:25,269 --> 02:02:28,102
Who are they? - They had
thrashed me for begging for alms.

1509
02:02:38,073 --> 02:02:40,508
Who are you?
- We're lovers.

1510
02:02:40,909 --> 02:02:42,127
He is my boyfriend.

1511
02:02:42,212 --> 02:02:43,812
Can I take a selfie?

1512
02:02:44,494 --> 02:02:46,170
Rs. 100.
- Rs. 100?

1513
02:02:46,255 --> 02:02:49,091
Yes. Don't you want 'Like'
and Comment' on Facebook?

1514
02:02:49,297 --> 02:02:52,017
Rs. 50.
- Okay. - Okay.

1515
02:02:55,330 --> 02:02:58,489
I am at the bus station.
- Sir, please give me alms.

1516
02:02:58,925 --> 02:03:00,302
Greetings, sir.

1517
02:03:01,331 --> 02:03:04,225
Sir, the note is old, give us a new note.

1518
02:03:04,468 --> 02:03:06,227
Be quiet. Sir, that's all right.

1519
02:03:06,312 --> 02:03:08,212
We will take it.
- But... - Come.

1520
02:03:10,687 --> 02:03:12,582
Ma'am, give me alms.

1521
02:03:16,031 --> 02:03:18,594
Don't eat it.
- Why?

1522
02:03:19,332 --> 02:03:20,757
They will be stale at times.

1523
02:03:21,182 --> 02:03:22,927
Did you eat stale food?

1524
02:03:23,241 --> 02:03:24,884
Many times.

1525
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:27,184
When you are hungry, one can't help it.

1526
02:03:27,495 --> 02:03:29,709
Give it to me,
I will taste it and let you know.

1527
02:03:30,984 --> 02:03:32,215
Give it.

1528
02:03:33,475 --> 02:03:36,090
No, I will do it this time.

1529
02:03:40,524 --> 02:03:44,013
Wow! It tastes better than
the pizza in our restaurant.

1530
02:03:45,875 --> 02:03:47,199
Come.

1531
02:03:50,502 --> 02:03:52,176
Sir, please give me alms.

1532
02:03:54,265 --> 02:03:55,372
Take it.

1533
02:03:55,983 --> 02:03:58,072
The vow will get fulfilled
in some time now.

1534
02:03:58,157 --> 02:04:00,205
This is the last day of your begging..

1535
02:04:00,452 --> 02:04:02,396
..and then you and I...

1536
02:04:02,895 --> 02:04:04,098
How did you find out?

1537
02:04:04,183 --> 02:04:05,918
I had sent you a voice message.

1538
02:04:06,003 --> 02:04:07,349
Voice message?

1539
02:04:09,134 --> 02:04:12,872
When? - When you and your
friend were talking last night...

1540
02:06:25,550 --> 02:06:27,942
Come, finish him.

1541
02:06:28,584 --> 02:06:30,411
Come, stab him.

1542
02:06:31,542 --> 02:06:34,365
You have a chance to
become my close aide, come.

1543
02:06:37,480 --> 02:06:39,712
First, you prove that you're a man.

1544
02:06:39,797 --> 02:06:45,308
You named me Left because
I lost the fight against him..

1545
02:06:45,393 --> 02:06:48,975
..but instead of beating
him though you came with your men..

1546
02:06:49,430 --> 02:06:52,188
..you spiked his food and made him weak..

1547
02:06:52,525 --> 02:06:53,548
..are you a man?

1548
02:06:53,740 --> 02:06:57,497
Do you know what happened
when you asked me to tie him up?

1549
02:06:58,176 --> 02:07:01,187
I pretended to tie him up.

1550
02:07:01,272 --> 02:07:03,752
If you have the guts, fight him alone.

1551
02:07:06,854 --> 02:07:08,904
Left!
- Get lost!

1552
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:33,179
Siddu!

1553
02:07:34,088 --> 02:07:36,912
Siddu, listen to me! Siddu!

1554
02:07:40,686 --> 02:07:43,687
Siddu! Stop it, Siddu!

1555
02:07:43,772 --> 02:07:46,835
Enough. He will pay a price for his deeds.

1556
02:07:48,968 --> 02:07:51,243
Come. Take this.

1557
02:08:00,330 --> 02:08:03,144
Siddu!

1558
02:08:12,148 --> 02:08:13,611
Hey!

1559
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:28,514
Bindu!

1560
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:35,554
Bindu!

1561
02:09:04,498 --> 02:09:08,937
Doctor! Doctor look,
she's bleeding profusely!

1562
02:09:12,129 --> 02:09:14,541
Look, someone has slit
her throat with knife.

1563
02:09:14,789 --> 02:09:16,691
You must've picked up fight with someone.

1564
02:09:17,111 --> 02:09:18,389
This is a police case.

1565
02:09:18,474 --> 02:09:21,024
And what if someone comes
to the hospital and creates ruckus?

1566
02:09:21,317 --> 02:09:23,125
Bhuvana, send them away.
- Okay, sir.

1567
02:09:23,557 --> 02:09:25,283
Sir!
- Doctor!

1568
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:26,363
Just a minute, doctor.

1569
02:09:26,448 --> 02:09:28,592
I have been visiting various
hospitals past 18 months..

1570
02:09:28,708 --> 02:09:31,203
..I know the management
of the hospital very well.

1571
02:09:31,469 --> 02:09:33,146
I also know that if I don't deposit money..

1572
02:09:33,338 --> 02:09:35,563
..you won't start the treatment.

1573
02:09:38,070 --> 02:09:39,648
You must be wondering as to..

1574
02:09:39,733 --> 02:09:42,261
..how I will be able to pay the
bills seeing me in this attire, isn't it?

1575
02:09:43,608 --> 02:09:45,870
Give me the account details
of your hospital, doctor.

1576
02:09:47,434 --> 02:09:51,039
I will deposit any sum
of money within half-an-hour.

1577
02:09:51,124 --> 02:09:53,482
Please, doctor. Please treat her, doctor.

1578
02:09:53,567 --> 02:09:55,627
You say you will deposit any sum of money?

1579
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:57,879
Yes, I will.

1580
02:09:57,964 --> 02:09:58,998
Who are you?

1581
02:10:00,086 --> 02:10:01,973
Tell me, sir. Who are you?

1582
02:10:07,864 --> 02:10:10,111
At least tell me what you do.

1583
02:10:14,792 --> 02:10:16,262
Tell me, sir.

1584
02:10:22,818 --> 02:10:24,128
I am a beggar, sir.

1585
02:10:25,834 --> 02:10:26,983
I am a beggar.

1586
02:10:28,203 --> 02:10:29,397
I am a beggar.

1587
02:10:29,482 --> 02:10:33,616
Oh, will you get any sum of
money in alms if you beg in English?

1588
02:10:33,731 --> 02:10:35,922
Go away.
- Doctor!

1589
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:02,578
Oh no! Sir, come fast!

1590
02:11:04,574 --> 02:11:06,341
Bindu!

1591
02:11:10,513 --> 02:11:11,743
Bindu!

1592
02:11:27,510 --> 02:11:30,080
Mom, please forgive me.

1593
02:12:10,888 --> 02:12:13,008
Hello. Who is it?

1594
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:14,932
Siddu!

1595
02:12:15,254 --> 02:12:17,404
Hello?

1596
02:12:49,475 --> 02:12:52,574
Sir, here are the belongings
of the patient, check the purse.

1597
02:12:53,542 --> 02:12:54,675
He is here.

1598
02:12:59,313 --> 02:13:01,493
Get up. Inspector is calling you, come.

1599
02:13:01,770 --> 02:13:03,499
What did I do?
- Sir will tell you

1600
02:13:03,584 --> 02:13:05,282
listen to him. Come.
- Sir.

1601
02:13:05,661 --> 02:13:07,064
Okay?
- Sir.

1602
02:13:07,792 --> 02:13:09,709
It's him.
- Get into the vehicle.

1603
02:13:09,956 --> 02:13:12,355
Sir, what did I do?

1604
02:13:13,027 --> 02:13:15,515
Should I tell the reason to beggars?

1605
02:13:26,128 --> 02:13:27,411
Hey!

1606
02:13:30,206 --> 02:13:33,114
You beggar! How dare you hold my hand?

1607
02:13:33,647 --> 02:13:36,452
No, sir. I wanted to know the time, sir.

1608
02:13:36,537 --> 02:13:38,628
Sir, I have to spend some
money that I beg..

1609
02:13:38,713 --> 02:13:41,419
..and offer the rest of
the money to God within 11 a.m.

1610
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:43,547
Please, sir.
- After you offer the money to God..

1611
02:13:43,710 --> 02:13:45,162
..will you come with me to the station.

1612
02:13:45,281 --> 02:13:47,484
Sir.
- Go. Pick it up.

1613
02:13:49,772 --> 02:13:51,119
Siddu!

1614
02:13:51,554 --> 02:13:54,376
Come. Offer the money as you said.

1615
02:14:30,619 --> 02:14:32,540
Come on.

1616
02:14:46,459 --> 02:14:48,898
Inspector, take your hand off.

1617
02:14:49,066 --> 02:14:50,289
Do you know who he is?

1618
02:14:50,908 --> 02:14:52,491
Guards, escort him.

1619
02:14:52,576 --> 02:14:54,694
Siddu, go on.

1620
02:15:00,943 --> 02:15:03,565
Sir, who are you?

1621
02:15:53,550 --> 02:15:56,304
Sir, all the procedures
have been fulfilled.

1622
02:15:56,694 --> 02:15:58,079
She is out of danger.

1623
02:16:01,505 --> 02:16:02,578
Thank you.

1624
02:16:02,807 --> 02:16:05,195
Siddu, I have told everything
to our HR department.

1625
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:07,992
They will take care.
- Sir...

1626
02:16:08,345 --> 02:16:10,922
I didn't know who you were.
Please forgive me, sir.

1627
02:16:11,215 --> 02:16:12,160
Please, sir.

1628
02:16:12,614 --> 02:16:14,557
I was a beggar for all these days..

1629
02:16:14,812 --> 02:16:17,743
..but I never felt ashamed.

1630
02:16:18,411 --> 02:16:21,670
But today,
I feel ashamed of being a rich man.

1631
02:16:22,586 --> 02:16:26,037
You're apologizing to
me because I am rich man.

1632
02:16:26,971 --> 02:16:29,282
Value human being not money.

1633
02:16:32,711 --> 02:16:33,805
Breaking news.

1634
02:16:33,890 --> 02:16:36,977
Scam in mental asylum at Karavali.

1635
02:16:37,239 --> 02:16:40,852
The police has arrested Ram Naik,
the chief of this region.

1636
02:16:40,984 --> 02:16:44,045
It is like a relief to the residents.

1637
02:16:44,282 --> 02:16:46,128
In the other part of the state..

1638
02:16:46,213 --> 02:16:49,853
..the police has arrested rowdy
sheeter Arun Kale in the same case.

1639
02:16:49,996 --> 02:16:55,378
Kale received money from two
persons to kill a renowned businessman.

1640
02:16:55,463 --> 02:17:00,257
The police say that they will
arrest the second accused very soon.

1641
02:17:00,342 --> 02:17:03,457
Marappa, the police is coming, go fast.

1642
02:17:03,542 --> 02:17:06,358
Don't you understand? Go fast.

1643
02:17:07,272 --> 02:17:08,353
Marappa.

1644
02:17:09,159 --> 02:17:11,717
Sir.
- Why did you stop the vehicle?

1645
02:17:11,802 --> 02:17:14,171
Putappa!

1646
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,523
How dare you beat me?

1647
02:17:17,608 --> 02:17:19,099
What's the matter with you?

1648
02:17:19,184 --> 02:17:22,465
Just to repay the money that I had borrowed
from you for my daughter's wedding..

1649
02:17:22,550 --> 02:17:25,598
..I tolerated you despite
of getting beaten up by you.

1650
02:17:25,683 --> 02:17:27,463
I have repaid the money to you last week..

1651
02:17:27,584 --> 02:17:29,714
..now, I am going to thrash you.

1652
02:17:29,799 --> 02:17:32,012
You idiot! I won't spare you!

1653
02:17:36,449 --> 02:17:39,064
Sir, wear the glasses.

1654
02:17:39,319 --> 02:17:41,706
Take it, sir. Wear it.

1655
02:17:43,561 --> 02:17:44,822
Sir.

1656
02:17:45,516 --> 02:17:46,683
Please get down.

1657
02:17:47,047 --> 02:17:48,150
Are you Putappa?

1658
02:17:51,887 --> 02:17:53,133
Sir.

1659
02:17:54,272 --> 02:17:55,623
This fellow hit me.

1660
02:18:31,775 --> 02:18:32,986
Siddu!

1661
02:18:33,545 --> 02:18:36,288
God let us down.

1662
02:18:37,310 --> 02:18:45,614
I think she is waiting for you
to fulfill the ritual with the holy water.

1663
02:18:46,589 --> 02:18:49,650
Go.
- Go.

1664
02:20:06,009 --> 02:20:06,932
Mom!

1665
02:20:08,418 --> 02:20:11,164
You needn't become normal like before..

1666
02:20:12,612 --> 02:20:14,124
..you don't have to do anything.

1667
02:20:15,261 --> 02:20:17,362
Just stay with me, mom.

1668
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:22,124
Who do I have other than you, mom?

1669
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:49,949
Though I lost faith in other things..

1670
02:20:51,086 --> 02:20:53,311
..I didn't lose faith in you.

1671
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:57,760
Don't betray be by parting from me.

1672
02:21:01,997 --> 02:21:04,387
I am standing as a beggar in front of you.

1673
02:21:06,623 --> 02:21:09,272
Your son is begging to you.

1674
02:21:10,811 --> 02:21:15,369
I beg to you to stay with
me for few more days, mom.

1675
02:21:26,948 --> 02:21:28,261
Mom!

1676
02:21:29,746 --> 02:21:30,722
Mom!

1677
02:21:32,559 --> 02:21:35,922
Please have mercy up on me.

1678
02:21:44,524 --> 02:21:53,879
This is a true story of a boy who vowed
to beg for six months to save his mother.

1679
02:21:54,011 --> 02:21:59,139
The film 'Amma, I love you'
was inspired by this story.

1680
02:21:59,224 --> 02:22:04,690
Thank you very much for
coming and watching this movie.

1681
02:22:31,149 --> 02:22:33,020
Sir, please give me that roll.

1682
02:22:33,105 --> 02:22:35,328
You still behalf like a beggar.

1683
02:22:35,557 --> 02:22:36,923
Take it.
- Hello.

1684
02:22:37,257 --> 02:22:39,358
Old habits die hard, you know.

1685
02:22:39,741 --> 02:22:42,547
Sir, fix that thing.
- You won't reform.

1686
02:22:43,357 --> 02:22:45,942
Ma'am, sir asked me to give you juice.

1687
02:22:51,583 --> 02:22:53,009
Bindu, hold her for a minute.

1688
02:22:53,166 --> 02:22:54,975
Mom, I will be back in a minute.

1689
02:22:57,377 --> 02:22:58,971
Hello. Hi, Stephen.

1690
02:22:59,130 --> 02:23:00,828
Sir, please give me alms.

1691
02:23:00,913 --> 02:23:01,907
Please give me alms.

1692
02:23:02,042 --> 02:23:03,902
Sir. Ma'am.
- Come here.

1693
02:23:03,987 --> 02:23:06,406
Don't worry about it,
I have spoken to the officer.

1694
02:23:06,680 --> 02:23:09,168
God bless you.
- I will call you back later.

1695
02:23:09,622 --> 02:23:11,682
Siddu. - Mom.
- Come here.

1696
02:23:13,951 --> 02:23:16,184
Yes, mom.
- Did you notice that beggar?

1697
02:23:16,413 --> 02:23:18,746
No, mom,
I was on an important call.

1698
02:23:18,831 --> 02:23:20,387
We might be very busy..

1699
02:23:20,954 --> 02:23:22,500
..do the offering if you can afford..

1700
02:23:23,221 --> 02:23:24,913
..if you can't, send him away.

1701
02:23:25,402 --> 02:23:27,346
We must not make someone
wait unnecessarily.

1702
02:23:27,968 --> 02:23:33,494
The life of a beggar is miserable.

1703
02:23:34,687 --> 02:23:37,857
Nobody should go through that situation.

1704
02:23:38,529 --> 02:23:43,057
We won't be able to live
as a beggar even for one single day.

1705
02:23:48,162 --> 02:23:49,599
Sorry, mom.

1706
02:23:55,864 --> 02:23:57,215
Let's move.
