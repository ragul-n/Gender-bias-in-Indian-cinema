But Sasi, we are happy, aren't we?

22
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,842
Just because I'm happy with you
on bed, for half hour in a day

23
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,694
I am unable to tolerate you for
the rest of the 23 and half hours.

Hey Sasi...

30
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:25,032
What's wrong with you? You used to get
angry if I drink without saying 'cheers'

31
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:26,956
You need to say 'cheers'
while you're angry!

Bearer! Two more!

33
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:44,693
Hey manager...
Send two large to that table

34
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:46,129
Ok sir, I'd send.

35
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:52,779
What's up man? You always picked
me up whenever I visited Hyderabad.

36
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,122
But if you called me directly to bar this
time, there's something really wrong.

37
00:05:59,073 --> 00:06:01,578
Is that a whole family I see there?

38
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,590
What's the problem?

39
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:09,022
I thought you invited over to
celebrate your promotion.

40
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:11,795

What's the matter?

-You called me for that?

Friends state has ruined very bad lately.

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,957
Everyone needs a friend to encourage until
the girl falls for him, later they ignore.

48

A little hiccup in the relationship,
they immediately call them for help.

49
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:50,473
You are senseless and we are shameless!

50
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:56,247
Are you a kiddo to
fight over petty issues?

51
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:58,454
Why don't you act matured?

52
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:00,497
I didn't expect this from you.

53
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:04,043
Do you even remember
how you were back then?

54

I'm promoting you and

-Yes!

-Really?
-Yeah!

understand why you want to go to Hyderabad

It's not sudden, it's planned!

-You too can join us!

every weekend, but let's see.

-Bye! I miss you!

Though I am now very close by
to you, I can't come to you.

77
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:05,383
Because I don't want to miss the sparkle
in your eyes, the moment you see me.

78
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:09,840
I want to see the sky that
swirls while lift me and swirl

I am stopping myself.

now, let's go to pub!

-Here's the menu sir.

If we were educated enough,
we wouldn't have asked you.

We don't understand the normal English,

names to the drinks!

-Oh, so you'd serve if we abuse you?
-That's not an abuse sir, it's a cocktail.

114
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:35,940
Oh by cocktail you mean, you'd mix
and shake all the drink together?

115

-Is it that?
-Yes sir.

116

-Juice!

like and give a mocktail to my friend too.

-Oh, you call it a mocktail?

far better than heroines.

We must take them to our hometown and
make them perform for festival carnivals.

00:12:32,674 --> 00:12:37,163
Talk low, it doesn't look good if
they over hear us. It's posh culture!

123
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:40,367
My foot! If theirs is posh
culture ours is village culture.

124
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:46,405
We pay for their dance, here they pay
and dance, that's the only difference!

125
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:50,423
You want company?

126
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:56,162
I don't have company. All I have is
shrimp ponds. I recently bought 5 acres.

127

Why did she leave?

128
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:03,795

-But you can't dance!
-As if they can!

146
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:09,316
Also if we just go and stand among
them, they will make us dance.

147
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:10,936
I can't. You go!

Let's go home.

152
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:29,013
Ok, you go and wait in the car. I will
talk to her and be back in 5 minutes.

What a sudden surprise!

154
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:42,819
Come on Sasi, these all are common.

155
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:47,375
She is my manager, her husband is on-site.
It's very common technique for appraisal.

156
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:53,215
Oh shit! Why am I explaining them to you?

157
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:56,666
You are a Mumbai girl,
you must know this for sure.

158
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,671
I differ from the rest in Mumbai!

159

I know baby! I know!

160
00:17:08,856 --> 00:17:11,474
Now that you are here,
I'd be with you only!

161
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:18,036
Don't get very upset.
I know you've come for me.

162
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:22,075
Where can you go leaving
me? I am the only option.

163
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:32,037
What are you checking out? None
of the Hyderabad boys are single.

164
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:37,362
They will have some girl. As I
told you, I am your only option.

166
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,077
You didn't change at all.
You are still the same.

00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:24,398
How could she kiss me in
public all of a sudden?

168
00:18:24,598 --> 00:18:26,862
One must be destined, for anything!

You don't worry about it.

170
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:33,762
Stop it man! I am not
upset because she kissed me...

171
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:38,387
-Then?
-But for leaving me there.

172
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:41,499
Oh my goodness! Is that the
reason, why you are crying?

173
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:44,251
I think you really enjoyed it!

174
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:47,885
Stop wetting your lips, they might swell!

175
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:51,003
I became totally sober
after hearing what you said.

176
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:53,178
Not sure when you'd mend your ways!

177
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,797
Hey, do you realise how much
you've changed in the last 2 years?

178
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:01,741
Do you remember how you
were in your childhood?

179
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:06,166
Fearing people might judge you, you used
to take the other way, away from wine shop

180
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,926
Look at you now, you have
become a drunkard totally!

181
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:19,738
It's been six months since you've been
to Hyderabad. Couldn't you find a job?

182
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:23,387
-Dad... I mean...
-Why are you stammering?

183
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:26,762
Subbu's son's salary is Rs 1 Lakh!
He's taking dowry of Rs crore.

184
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:29,612
It's been six months since you've
gone. Why didn't find job yet?

185
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:35,380
Finding a job is easy, but finding the one
that pays 1 Lakh will take some time dad.

186
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,760
I don't know what you'd do. But you must
find a job who'd you pay more than him.

187
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,356
And I must take more
dowry than his dad did.

188
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:46,925
Don't mind spending 4-5 lakhs to
procure it. But salary must be 1 Lakh!

189
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:52,706
Damn it! I wanted to
stop studies after B tech

190
00:19:52,906 --> 00:19:55,731
and wanted to get
into shrimps business.

191
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:58,758
But my dad is pestering
me to find a job!

192
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,764
If you have studied B tech,
why don't you work?

193
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:06,971
Yes, why not! Though I secured 90% all
the subjects, I hardly got 40% in English.

194
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:10,652
All the companies I seek job
at, ask me to speak English!

195
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:11,631
Oh is it?

196
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:19,545
I know a company, if you pay them 4-5
Lakhs, they will give you offer letter.

197
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:22,005
Won't they pay salary every month?

198
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:24,962
Damn you and your stupidity!

199
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,923
I meant, they'd give you job!

200
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:29,211
Ok, no problem! We shall pay them!

201
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:40,278
Oh my God! Is she feeling nervous?
Anyhow, I don't have that problem.

202
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:41,873
Anyhow I'd receive my
offer letter directly!

203
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:43,710
Mr Shiva...

204
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,123
"Shiva turned fortunate
but it costed him 4 lakhs"

205
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:52,786
"If he gets a good job it will
get him huge amount of dowry"

206
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,984
-Please wait, Ma'am will come.
-Ma'am? I think its must be a sir...

207
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:58,869
That sir was laid off.
A madam has substituted him.

208
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:02,305
Huh? How about my money?

209
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:06,530
"Shiva is doomed and lost his money"

210
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,978
"If his dad comes to know this
he will bash black and blue"

211
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:15,918
We will do it by this week, ok?
We will mail the information. Thank you.

212
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:21,435
"Shiva has turned fortunate
again, with the entry of the girl"

213
00:21:21,635 --> 00:21:25,611
"The girl who kissed him,
has come and charmed him"

214
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:26,796
Your profile?

215
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:32,713
What?

216
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:38,382
Tell me about yourself.

217
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:41,658
Did you recognise me?

218
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:45,391
I said tell me about yourself.

219
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:53,540
I cleared all the rounds,
I just came to collect my offer letter.

220
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,384
-How much did you pay?
-Just 4-5 La...

221
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,928
They came to know about that employee's
fraud and appointed me in his place.

222
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:04,084
And I follow my process.

223
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:07,415
Tell me about yourself.

224
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,653
I am Shiva.

225
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:11,092
What do you know about this company?

226
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:14,663
Starting pay is 12 Lakhs,
which means per month it's 1 Lakh.

227
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:19,653
What is System Analysis?

228
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:25,793
That is... I mean... Er...

229
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:29,469
-Do you know the answer or not?
-I do know!

230
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:33,230
But I find it a little
difficult to say it in English.

231
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,540
Not a little, in fact a lot difficult!

232
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,096
-Is it easy in say in Telugu?
-Yes!

233
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:40,290
It's ok, please go ahead.

234
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:46,762
The processing of input we
feed into the system as output.

235
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:50,620
System analysis deals with
analyzing how this process works.

236
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,540
Hmm not bad!

237
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,320
You know the subject Shiva,
but you are poor at communication.

238
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,209
You know we work with foreign
clients, English is very important.

239
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:08,362
Mr Shiva, I will give you 15 days time,
improve your English and come back.

240
00:23:08,562 --> 00:23:12,019
If I couldn't learnt since Childhood,
will 15 days bring any difference?

241
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:14,197
-What?
-Nothing!

242
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:21,394
-Shiva,
-Ma'am?

243
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:26,393
That night at pub, it was just an accident

244
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:30,202
I thought you forgot, so you didn't!

245
00:23:30,402 --> 00:23:35,462
If you don't forget that, you may
have to forget about this job!

246
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:39,319
I hope you understood!

247
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,757
15 days time! So keep practicing!

248
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:47,440
I must take an oath to speak only
in English for the next 15 days!

249
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,314
No, I have already taken the oath!

250
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:53,948
-This auto... where going?
-Where do you want to go exactly?

251
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,113
Please take to Housing board colony.

252
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:05,945
How are you able to speak such
good English, being an auto driver?

253
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,956
I commute the students of St
Ann's school everyday.

254
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,686
I learnt by listening to them.

255
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:12,795
You learnt just by listening to them?

256
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:16,871
I have been listening, from school
and college, but never learnt anything.

257
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:21,467
Fine, let's try!

258
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:22,885
Please stop here!

259
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:31,621
-How much?
-Thank you so much!

260
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,761
Damn him and his punchlines in English!

261
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,944
[religious chants]

262
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:42,747
Dude, you remember she?

263
00:24:42,947 --> 00:24:44,139
Who is that she?

264
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:46,809
The girl who kissed in pub that night?

265
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:50,796
-Oh yeah!
-She's my HR manager in office.

266
00:24:50,927 --> 00:24:55,781
I guess you are very happy to find
the girl who kissed and disappeared.

267
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:58,018
Dude, but speaks good English!

268
00:24:58,218 --> 00:25:00,732
You are going wrong again!

269
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:07,317
Back in college we tried hard to impress
English medium girls to pass in English.

270
00:25:08,788 --> 00:25:14,595
Forget about impressing, did they
at least look at our Telugu medium faces?

271
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:15,691
Did you forget that insult?

272
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:21,372
Women can feel pride with money,
but never for being better at English!

273
00:25:21,572 --> 00:25:24,199
-They will dominate you!
-She is not like those bad girls!

274
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,197
She is different!

275
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:29,165
That is our men's weakness!

276
00:25:29,365 --> 00:25:33,426
We'll say she's
different if we like her.

277
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:38,208
If she ditches, we shall
chide her like any other girl.

278
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,685
Anyhow we'd meet in the
evening, we shall then talk in detail.

279
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:44,823
Ok bye!

280
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:55,965
You always used to travel overnight,
why did you travel all day this time?

281
00:25:56,165 --> 00:26:01,193
My life asks for some
change, so started with journey

282
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,338
Good evening sir, order please!

283
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:06,415
-What is the costliest peg in your bar?
-Glenfiddich

284
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:09,010
-What is the cheapest?
-Mansion house.

285
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,907
Get two of them!

286
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:15,267
-And a juice for him! Juice... ok?
-I got it sir.

287
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:20,604
I think it's really getting hot here.
Yeah, our hometown was far better.

288
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,105
Cheers!

289
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:35,445
Rascal! He doesn't even feel any
difference in the juice taste!

290
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:41,555
Dude... Why do you look confused?

291
00:26:41,755 --> 00:26:45,731
-We shall have one more!
-One more!

292
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:50,372
Dude, please stop at a wine shop!

293
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:54,666
But we just came out of bar, why
do you want to stop at wine shop?

294
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:59,466
Isn't a patient who visits a doctor
in hospital stops by a medical shop?

295
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:03,198
-This is similar to that!
-Then let's go!

296
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,955
-Stop! Stop!
-Hey dude, it's police!

297
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:15,626
-Sir...
-Let me handle this

298
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,530
Sorry sir, my glasses are
fogged, I couldn't see you.

299
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,498
But where are your glasses man?

300
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:28,542
Oh no! I lost my glasses sir,
please take the complaint.

301
00:27:28,742 --> 00:27:30,811
I will, come along!

302
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:33,734
Since you guys catch hold of us on
Main roads we chose these lanes.

303
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:36,065
You stop us here too?

304
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:38,676
-Sir please sir!
-Hey girl don't cover your face.

305
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:41,551
-My dad will scold me sir
-Doesn't he scold if you drink?

306
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:44,450
No sir, he will scold only
if I am caught by police.

307
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:50,901
My husband had just one beer...

308
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:52,801
How can you stop him for that?

309
00:27:53,831 --> 00:27:59,796
If having one beer is also a crime then,
why don't you shut all the wine shops?

310
00:28:00,196 --> 00:28:02,105
If one has a wife like her...

311
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:07,003
...all the drunkards lives will be happy!

312
00:28:07,203 --> 00:28:08,984
[honking]

313
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:11,888
Bullabbai here...

314
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:16,391
-Good morning madam!
-Who are you?

315
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:19,363
How much did you drink?

316
00:28:19,563 --> 00:28:21,367
-6 pegs!
-I knew!

317
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,442
-Good morning sir, Amalapuram!
-I will talk to him!

318
00:28:24,742 --> 00:28:30,652
How atrocious! My madam had just
6 pegs! How could you stop her?

319
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:34,445
Then first shut down all
the pubs in Hyderabad!

320
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:36,733
-What say dude?
-Correct!

321
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:40,974
But how could you stop
a woman for just 6 pegs?

322
00:28:41,574 --> 00:28:43,759
Move it! Come on go!

323
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:48,239
-Bullabbai!-Bullabbai from Amalapuram!

324
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:01,601
Hey, did Bullabbai leave?

325
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:05,219
What kind of a man is he? He is taking
more alcohol than water in a day.

326
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:07,587
He has asked for 24 hours bar address,
the moment he woke up in the morning.

327
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,331
He'll die very soon,
if he drinks like this!

328
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:13,325
-He never changes!
-By the way, what's your job's status?

329
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,927
[phone ringing]

330
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:21,306
-Hello
-Please connect to Sasi Madam.

331
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,611
[intercom ringing]

332
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:27,090
Sorry, just a minute! Hello...

333
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:31,572
Not bad, you've showed up to office
even after being drunk so much last night!

334
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:36,580
-Who is this?
-I Shiva...

335
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,342
Night, police help! Before
that you told to learn English...

336
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:44,153
Prior to that we kissed in pub...

337
00:29:44,353 --> 00:29:47,989
Enough! Why did you call? I'm busy
right now, I will talk to you later.

338
00:29:48,189 --> 00:29:52,165
Huh?
Sorry guys!

339
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:55,997
So system analysis is...

340
00:29:56,913 --> 00:29:59,878
You said later, but didn't mention time...

341
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:03,788
Night, call on my personal
number I will then talk to you.

345
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:32,385
I'm enjoying what about you?

346
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:36,761
Be careful, you might end up kissing
a watchman or a lift man this time.

347
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,105
I spoke in perfect
English nonstop for 2 minutes.

348
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:45,552
Please correct me if I am wrong.

350
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:58,323
Funny guy!

351
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,724
You are left with only 10 days to my
deadline. I will teach you English!

352
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,674
Ok, madam. Thank you!

[indistinct conversation]

354
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:22,572
I'll give you an assignment.
This is a scene from Avatar...

355
00:31:22,772 --> 00:31:25,497
...try to understand and explain it.

[Translates the dialogues to Telugu]

357
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:38,989
Sounds like dialogues
from a dubbed movie.

358
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:44,445
I actually told the dialogues from
Telugu dubbed version of Avatar

359
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:48,210
I'll catch in the parking slot 9 pm.

360
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,897
Why does she say she'd catch
at the parking slot at 9 pm?

361
00:31:52,097 --> 00:31:54,082
Let me check it in translator...

362
00:31:54,282 --> 00:31:56,753
Catch you... parking slot...

363
00:31:56,953 --> 00:32:01,777
Oh she meant she'd meet me... My
bad! Ok madam, let's catch up!

I'm in confusion, call.

366
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:21,372
Don't you have sense when
I said am busy, I am busy.

367
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,590
Thank you so much, call you later.

368
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,125
Hello, my name is Shruthi,
may I know how may I help you.

369
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:32,456
-SIM Related? PAN related?
-No!

370
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:34,587
-Internet?
-No!

371
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:38,812
-Then what is your problem sir?
-It's my personal problem.

372
00:32:39,012 --> 00:32:40,897
It is English problem.

373
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,733
Sir, I am not an English Tutor.

374
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:48,577
If you don't talk to me in English, I'll
complain that you didn't talk in properly

375
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:50,793
and thus I am switching
to another network.

376

-Madam I have a doubt...
-What's that?

378
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:03,595
There are a lot of slangs in Telugu,
similarly English also might have...

379
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:05,682
Which slang are you teaching me?

380
00:33:05,882 --> 00:33:07,969
Stop worrying about slang
and concentrate on language first.

381

-Hello excuse me, give me paper
-They are right there...

382
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:16,435
Not Telugu, only English paper.

384
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,816

What are you blabbering?

00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,790
-English dad!-Big deal!

388

Hi I'm RGV, they dislike me!

398
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:19,132
You too might dislike me in future,
let's chat while we're still good.

399
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:23,009
Shiva... follow me on Twitter,
we shall talk in the evening.

400
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:25,362
Office seems too good!

401

-What's your hometown?
-Amalapuram!

402
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:34,892
Are you too from
Amalapuram? Where exactly?

403
00:34:35,092 --> 00:34:38,387
-Godilanka
-Ours is Magaam!

404
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:47,704
-Are you done with your introductions?
-We both hail from the same town

405
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:50,669
Then you both can go to your hometown
in the same bus for Sankranthi(festival)

406
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:53,575
Until then,
would you mind your work?

407
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:58,728
Where do you stay in Godilanka

408
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:08,866
-Hey Sasi, you are looking gorgeous!
-Thank you!

409
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:13,115
-How about a coffee?
-[sighs] I have a boy friend.

410
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:16,748

-Ashok!
-Yeah!

412
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:25,057
Sorry, may be some other time.

413
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:34,153
After you joined the office,
I feel as though I'm in my native.

414
00:35:34,353 --> 00:35:35,821
Thank you!

415
00:35:37,592 --> 00:35:41,386
Don't take it as a compliment, she chided
that you are behaving like a country man

416
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:45,010
-Why does he say you chided?
-No, I said on a positive note.

417
00:35:49,995 --> 00:35:53,713
-Please order something Ma'am.
-I won't, you must!

418
00:35:53,913 --> 00:35:56,941
He doesn't know Telugu,
you don't know Hindi.

419
00:35:57,141 --> 00:36:00,524
Please order for this time,
I will lose my prestige.

420
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:04,297
It's ok, it's not your life
that you lose, so you order.

421
00:36:10,317 --> 00:36:12,306
-Thank you madam.
-Let's go Madam!

422
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:16,471
We think we can't achieve,
so we don't even try attempting it.

423
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:20,387
But if it is inevitable,
we will attempt it and succeed too

424
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:22,095
This is called 'Survival Benefit'

425
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:25,898
If you take every situation in a similar
manner, you will learn English in no time

426
00:36:26,098 --> 00:36:29,181
-I'll try
-Good. Just concentrate on fluency.

427
00:36:29,381 --> 00:36:31,855
Come home from tomorrow.
I will take classes at night.

428
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:35,125
Night classes?

429
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,775
-Hi Madam!
-Hi, come in.

430
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:45,414
-Your house is amazing!
-Thanks!

431
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:50,191
-You stay alone in this huge flat?
-Yes, why?

432
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:52,053
I must say, you are really bold!

433
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:57,510
It it were me, I would've
run to my friend's rooms.

434
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,369
-Out of fear?
-No way!

435
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,247
-Huh?
-I mean, yeah out of fear!

436
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:10,888
Don't you feel bored to stay alone?

437
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:14,953
I do feel bored, but I
have no friends here.

438
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:19,006
So I don't mean at least
a friend to you?

439
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:20,262
No!

440
00:37:20,462 --> 00:37:23,721
Don't you feel bad to say that?

441
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:26,555
What did you do for me,
to take you as my friend?

442
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:28,718
I am learning English from
you, without paying fee, ain't I?

443
00:37:28,918 --> 00:37:32,702
Hello, I am teaching you
English, without taking fee.

444
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:34,803
Yeah, true!

445
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:46,092
Long weekend! I feel bored here,
I don't want to go to Mumbai.

446
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:48,543
Why don't you go on a trip?

447
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,685
If you want to be my friend,
you must do something, will you?

448
00:37:54,885 --> 00:37:55,672
What's that?

449
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:59,195
-Take me to a nice place!
-Me? Take you?

450
00:37:59,395 --> 00:38:02,799
-Should I take you?
-Then let's take all the colleagues.

451
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:06,845
I didn't mean that. How do we go?

452
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:08,935
-We'll go on your bike.
-On bike?

453
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:11,358
Ok, tell me where do we go.

454
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:14,997
Why do you think so much? Just get
the bike, we'll go wherever we'd like to.

455
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:52,063
"Freedom has welcomed, just go on"

456
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:57,654
"Staring at the colours of the world,
just spread your wings and fly"

457
00:38:58,643 --> 00:39:02,896
"What is that, that you own?
A little smile is your wealth"

458
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:08,232
"Happiness alone leads you to salvation"

459
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:14,234
"There's no point cribbing on
the time you wasted dreaming"

460
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:19,186
"There's no such ocean in this
world, which can stop its tides"

461
00:39:19,887 --> 00:39:25,223
"No God will tell you who
will come to rescue you"

462
00:39:25,423 --> 00:39:27,210
"Just follow your
heart and go on"

463
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:31,637
Two rooms please!

464
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:36,464
I came to the trip because I stay alone in
room, you want me to do the same here too?

465
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:53,135
Do you have any love stories?

466
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:55,131
Why not?
I have about 12-13 stories.

467
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:56,837
Narrate one of those!

468
00:39:57,048 --> 00:40:02,147
While I was waiting at
bus stop, a bus arrived

469
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:05,175
...a girl from the bus, looked at me.

470
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:08,801
I thought she is the one for me.

471
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:12,716
As I was dreaming my life
with her, I closed my eyes.

472
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:16,171
By the time I opened
my eyes, the bus left.

473
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:20,417
-Where is love in this story?
-There is, and I alone know it.

474
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:22,673
So all of your love stories
are such single frame stories?

475
00:40:22,873 --> 00:40:27,799
In another instance when the priest
was giving me the Prasad in the temple...

476
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:32,085
I forgot to collect it,
a goddess called me from behind.

477
00:40:32,285 --> 00:40:36,574
That's all, I dreamt I married her,
raised kids, got them married...

478
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:39,237
If the girl's hand touches while
giving the book, it's a love story.

479
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,746
If the girl's dupatta falls on
my face, it's a love story too

480
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:46,440
If they talk among
themselves and look at me,

481
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,987
I throw a party to our friends to
celebrate that she looked at me.

482
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:56,413
There'd be innumerable
such love stories for boys!

483
00:40:56,613 --> 00:40:58,314
Enough! Please stop!

484
00:40:59,769 --> 00:41:02,762
Put that aside,
do you have any love story?

485
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:06,804
I too had one!
He was my senior at college

486
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:12,388
I met you, when I broke
up with him. That's all.

487
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:30,223
[hums a song]

488
00:41:31,988 --> 00:41:34,844
[continues to sing]

489
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:43,858
Is this kiss too like the one,
you gave me that night?

490
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:51,398
That is accident, this is commitment.

491
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:59,502
That night, I kissed being angry at him.

492
00:41:59,702 --> 00:42:03,970
Tonight, I kissed with my love for you.

493
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:27,263
A lot might have
experienced love at first sight.

494
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:31,696
But I experienced, love at first kiss!

495
00:42:33,273 --> 00:42:34,387
I love you Sasi!

496
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:39,983
-Shiva, do you know mind reading?

I love you too Shiva!

499
00:42:48,238 --> 00:42:51,470

asks me to get close to you"

Without you, I am unable
to go even till the gate, Shiva.

I will be very happy
if you are by my side.

These three days are the
best days in my entire life.

518
00:45:21,106 --> 00:45:25,051
Sankranthi festival 3 days are the most
memorable days for me since childhood.

519
00:45:25,996 --> 00:45:30,660
But these 3 days are much
memorable than Sankranthi.

520
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:37,449
I want to say "Please don't go"

But we'd anyhow meet
in the office tomorrow.

Meeting is different
from staying together.

I can't afford to miss
you even for a second!

525

What do we do now?

526
00:45:55,329 --> 00:45:57,993
You move in with me,
we'll stay on my flat.

527
00:45:58,193 --> 00:46:01,313
We both in the same flat? What if
people come to know about it?

528
00:46:01,513 --> 00:46:06,975
While I am thinking about both of
us, why do you think about others?

529
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,553
Please move into my flat, Shiva!

Rs750 cash. Whom can I blame?

maintain the kitchen properly.

This doesn't seem neat for him?

and sleep here without cleaning.

-Where is the dirt?

00:59:01,908 --> 00:59:05,801
Don't try to convince me,
I already took the decision.

664
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:09,381
Did you truly love him?

665
00:59:15,982 --> 00:59:20,818
Whilst I drank the alcohol
and are you feeling giddy?

666
00:59:21,018 --> 00:59:22,532
Sorry sir!

667

[pathos song playing on radio]

668
00:59:33,271 --> 00:59:36,216
I too wanted this song!

669
00:59:38,043 --> 00:59:40,415
She left me and went away!

670
00:59:40,615 --> 00:59:43,042
We can never understand women!

671
00:59:43,242 --> 00:59:44,590
Sir we have reached home.

672
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:49,948
You've played super song!
Thank you sir!

673
00:59:52,585 --> 00:59:58,164
Here, a hundred bucks for you
and a hundred for the song!

674
00:59:58,364 --> 00:59:59,815
You are amazing sir!

675
01:00:00,015 --> 01:00:03,663
[hums the song]

676
01:00:17,192 --> 01:00:19,341
Hey Sasi, you are back?

677
01:00:21,777 --> 01:00:26,078
Stop being foolish! Will any
couple split for petty things?

678
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:31,198
If it happens once in a day, it's petty,
if it happens repetitively it's serious.

679
01:00:31,398 --> 01:00:33,161
But if it happens everyday?

680
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:37,245
Look Sasi, I don't say
I am not at fault...

681
01:00:37,445 --> 01:00:40,400
but neither I am
pointing out your faults.

682
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,387
Life is all about
adjustments. You must adjust...

683
01:00:45,427 --> 01:00:46,701
I too must adjust!

684
01:00:47,701 --> 01:00:49,049
I don't need to!

685
01:00:51,808 --> 01:00:54,916
Anyway, I took a decision and I
don't want to be with you anymore.

686
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:01,541
Not bad, you too picked up a bit
of mind reading in this one year

687
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,370
You spoke my mind out!

688
01:01:10,005 --> 01:01:14,926
If you want to go you may go! But to
remind the mistake I did in my life,

689
01:01:15,126 --> 01:01:17,282
...let those photos be there!

690
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,765
Fearing of remembering you,
I decided to leave this house

691
01:01:26,252 --> 01:01:29,635
How did you think that I'd
be on your side in the photo?

692
01:01:33,146 --> 01:01:38,157
Neither me nor my phone
hold any memories of you!

693
01:01:38,357 --> 01:01:41,821
Including your number.
I have deleted everything!

694
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,522
You too better delete everything.

695
01:01:44,722 --> 01:01:48,515
[scoffs] I will, you may get lost!

696
01:01:53,215 --> 01:01:55,741
No, do it right away! In my presence!

697
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:57,639
Don't you believe me?

698
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:02,327
Oh sorry, if you had believed me, you
wouldn't have thought of breaking up?

699
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:08,360
Where did I put it?

700
01:02:09,889 --> 01:02:12,673
Were you so drunk that you don't even
know where you've put your phone?

701
01:02:13,822 --> 01:02:15,765
Make it quick! I am getting late.

702
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:18,916
If you are in such a hurry,
why don't you call? You can hear the ring!

703
01:02:19,116 --> 01:02:23,808
Oh sorry, you deleted my
number isn't it? Shall I tell?

704
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:25,714
[keypad tones]

705
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:32,546
Oh you remember? Formatting this
isn't as easy as formatting the phone!

706
01:02:33,756 --> 01:02:35,003
It's ringing!

707
01:02:35,203 --> 01:02:37,194
But I don't hear it anywhere.

708
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:40,064
Did you put it on silent mode?

709
01:02:40,264 --> 01:02:44,624
I don't even remember where I've put my
phone, how would I remember those details?

710
01:02:46,092 --> 01:02:49,248
[automated voice]
What happened?

711
01:02:49,448 --> 01:02:50,689
Someone has disconnected the call.

712
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:56,513
What? Disconnected? Call
again, turn the Speaker on!

713
01:02:56,741 --> 01:03:00,114
Automated voice: The number you
have dialled is switched off.

714
01:03:03,472 --> 01:03:04,557
Switched off?

715
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:21,262
Don't worry Sasi,
we must not have lost it.

716
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:24,042
What happens even if we lose it?

717
01:03:43,439 --> 01:03:48,041
Breaking news: Leaked Lover's romantic
video is going viral on the internet.

718
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,959
How did it surface on the internet?

719
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:55,210
Are they still together or did one of
them upload being upset with the other?

720
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:57,364
Please watch the
details after the break!

[news repeats]

722
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:20,357
Welcome back! It's a personal affair
that happens behind closed doors.

723
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:25,171
But with the present technology that
secret is now exposed and available to all

724
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:28,583
While these turn some lives upside down,

725
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:30,873
...for a few it's amusement!

726
01:04:31,073 --> 01:04:34,677
Not sure if they are trying to
evolve with the changing times...

727
01:04:34,877 --> 01:04:37,346
...the youth is sidelined to perversion!

728
01:04:37,546 --> 01:04:42,494
Mostly we have seen secretly
recorded videos until lately...

729
01:04:42,794 --> 01:04:48,778
but now they are themselves recording
these private moments as a memory.

730
01:04:49,178 --> 01:04:53,742
We see a video that was shot at a
park in Bangalore that is viral.

731
01:04:53,942 --> 01:04:57,538
That girl had killed herself,
as this video of hers went viral

732
01:04:57,738 --> 01:05:03,206
People are chiding for her deeds as
shameless, instead of showing any sympathy

733
01:05:20,194 --> 01:05:22,804
Don't cry, that video is not ours!

734
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:26,304
What if it happens to be our video?

735
01:05:26,504 --> 01:05:28,922
Don't over think! Stay strong!

736
01:05:32,314 --> 01:05:34,880
Where did you go Sasi?
You didn't even answer my call.

737
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,570
Did you miss me that badly?

738
01:05:39,918 --> 01:05:43,485
If I knew half hour will be this terrible
without you, I'd have come with you.

739
01:05:43,685 --> 01:05:46,171
It's your birthday isn't it?
I wanted to surprise you.

740
01:05:46,371 --> 01:05:47,809
Surprise? What is it?

741
01:05:50,638 --> 01:05:52,698
Wow! iphone?

742
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,474
What's there to get
surprised in an iphone?

743
01:05:59,371 --> 01:06:01,189
It has our selfie as it's first pic!

744
01:06:02,473 --> 01:06:04,017
No surprise in selfie either.

745
01:06:05,774 --> 01:06:09,779
It has our kissing video too
now! What else do you want?

01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:12,075
[whining]
What?

747
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:16,064

750
01:06:46,137 --> 01:06:48,683
We will find the phone, trust me.

I can't see you crying!

752
01:06:56,204 --> 01:06:59,218
My life is ruined once that video is out!

753
01:06:59,418 --> 01:07:02,367
Does your life alone
gets ruined, not mine?

754
01:07:02,567 --> 01:07:05,906
You're a man, you will roam happily!

755
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:09,408
People will think you are a
hero and I am your mistress!

756
01:07:14,696 --> 01:07:20,390
Hero is it? How easily you could
say it! Don't we have parents?

757
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:24,702
Don't we have a family? You compete
with men in everything don't you?

758
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:29,283
You smoke, you booze also
shoot such selfie videos!

759
01:07:29,483 --> 01:07:35,372
Only when such a miserable situation
arises, you recall you are a woman, is it?

760
01:07:36,614 --> 01:07:39,493
Does only such situations
remind you of your womanhood?

761
01:07:39,693 --> 01:07:43,053
You better know this,
I didn't just spend the night with you...

762
01:07:44,376 --> 01:07:45,890
I made love to you!

such a famous line too?

-There's so much love in it?
-Ok sir sorry sir, One more!

767

Srujana... did you eat? [mobile ringing]

768
01:08:14,517 --> 01:08:15,457
Put that phone in silent mode!

769
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:20,359
-Sir, if I don't answer, he will bug me!
-Where do you find such wastrels?

770
01:08:20,559 --> 01:08:24,090
-Shiva, did you eat?
-Yeah I did!

771
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:26,397
I called for a favour...

772
01:08:26,597 --> 01:08:29,107
Hey, it's month end,
I already ran out of money!

773
01:08:29,307 --> 01:08:30,613
First listen to me man!

774
01:08:31,055 --> 01:08:34,494
If it's not money, then I will
sacrifice my life for you dear!

775
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:40,032
I lost my phone, it's switched
off too, I must trace it.

776
01:08:40,232 --> 01:08:44,477
Tracing a switched off
phone is almost impossible.

777
01:08:44,677 --> 01:08:46,516
We can do nothing!

778
01:08:46,716 --> 01:08:49,448
Hey, hold on...

779
01:08:49,648 --> 01:08:53,864
Once you find the phone come
to our bar, we'd celebrate!

Come even if you don't
find it too, we'll booze!

find it too, we'll booze!

hope the phone is misplaced there.

I too shall come along.
I am going to a bar,

785
01:09:15,295 --> 01:09:17,199
I can handle, don't worry!

786
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:19,607
I said I'd come, to avoid my worry!

787
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:21,804
How can I believe that you'd
delete once you find the phone?

788
01:09:40,578 --> 01:09:44,202
-Shall we go miss?
-Ok mister!

789
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:05,745
Can you please drive a little faster?

01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:18,177
Shiva, please sit down!
Drive slow, I am scared.

792
01:10:18,421 --> 01:10:20,150
Shall I drive slow?
Or remove fear in you?

793
01:10:21,698 --> 01:10:23,195
Remove my fear!

-Yes sir...

-Yesterday I had drinks here.
-Everyone comes here for the same!

I misplaced my phone here.

-Yeah it's mine.

-Where did you put it man?
-In the rack down...

This is not mine. It was an iphone!

-Did you take my phone last night?
-Did I get his phone by mistake?

No dude, it's mine.

-What happened?
-My phone is missing from last night!

822
01:12:14,775 --> 01:12:17,533
How dare you call me a thief
just because we boozed together?

01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:20,693
-No man!
-Chill! It's just a phone! Buy another!

824

I'm not worried about the phone.

Sorry dude!

829
01:12:39,982 --> 01:12:43,137
When I heard 'video'
I said it in curiosity!

But how could you
record one such video?

831
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:52,299
People these days, forget people, we
ourselves won't stop watching such videos.

832
01:12:52,499 --> 01:12:56,407
After watching the whole video, we wonder
how could they even film such a video!

833
01:12:56,607 --> 01:12:59,181
Then, how could you do this dude?

834
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:11,167
What is this Sasi? You seem
to be a firebrand at office?

835
01:13:11,367 --> 01:13:13,826
Look at you, how you've
become for a day's fever...

836
01:13:14,026 --> 01:13:17,146
Fever treats everyone the
same! Did you get the tablets?

837
01:13:18,322 --> 01:13:19,439
-Here!
-Give them!

838
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:23,543
-Do you know when you'd use tablets?
-When we are down with fever.

839
01:13:23,912 --> 01:13:27,237
When there's none to take care of...

840
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:29,529
and the one who's there
can't take care of...

841
01:13:29,729 --> 01:13:32,168
But I am here to look after you

842
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:35,642
What are you doing? I feel cold.

843
01:13:35,842 --> 01:13:39,549
Didn't you tell that you're still
feeling cold even after wrapping blankets?

844
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:43,745
None could discover a
warmer blanket than a hug!

845
01:13:43,945 --> 01:13:46,830
Please, you also might catch it!

846
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:50,097
My body's resistance
power is very high!

847
01:13:57,413 --> 01:13:59,573
Resistance power is it?

848
01:14:06,165 --> 01:14:08,169
I don't remember anything Sasi.

849
01:14:08,369 --> 01:14:11,246
It's only you, whom I called
multiple times last night!

850
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:15,860
Later my mind totally went blocked!

851
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:20,047
I've told you umpteen times to set a
screen lock for a phone. But you didn't.

852
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:24,205
None other than you touch my phone,
and I don't like hiding anything from you.

853
01:14:24,464 --> 01:14:26,188
That's why I never set a lock.

854
01:14:26,388 --> 01:14:30,304
But now someone else has the
phone. What if they watch the video?

855
01:14:30,504 --> 01:14:32,549
They must switch on the phone to watch it.

856
01:14:32,749 --> 01:14:34,912
What if they already watched it at
night, and then switched it off?

857
01:14:36,034 --> 01:14:39,091
I am trying to talk positive
to make you feel better...

858
01:14:39,291 --> 01:14:42,235
and you in turn are talking
negative and scaring me more!

859
01:14:42,435 --> 01:14:44,136
Enough Sasi! [mobile ringing]

860
01:14:45,108 --> 01:14:48,298
Dude, go and raise a
complaint in Police station.

861
01:14:48,498 --> 01:14:52,049
Kukatpally Station CI is a very good
friend of mine. I already spoke to him.

862
01:14:52,249 --> 01:14:54,345
They give my reference and meet him.

863
01:14:54,684 --> 01:14:58,446
-How do you know that CI?
-Just shut up and do as I said.

864
01:15:17,169 --> 01:15:20,972
Who is stealing these days?
They are just killing each other.

865
01:15:21,172 --> 01:15:22,527
Deal it with care!

866
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:25,254
-I will call later
-Namasthe sir.

867
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:30,125
What's the matter?

868
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:33,893
Sir, I am Shiva and I lost my phone.

869
01:15:34,093 --> 01:15:37,381
So, will come directly to CI and
complain for after all a phone?

870
01:15:37,581 --> 01:15:39,502
Go and lodge a
complaint with the constable.

871
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:44,152
I am Bullabbai's friend. He
told that he has called you.

872
01:15:44,352 --> 01:15:49,248
-You mean that guy from Amalapuram?
-Yes sir.

873
01:15:49,448 --> 01:15:52,433
He called multiple times but I
didn't answer. So this is the matter

874
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:57,816
Sir, that phone is very
important for me, please find it urgently.

875
01:15:58,083 --> 01:16:01,689
If it's that urgent, you better buy a new
one, because here it takes time to find.

876
01:16:01,889 --> 01:16:06,026
-Bullabbai said he will talk to you!
-Is he a home minister?

877
01:16:06,226 --> 01:16:09,042
He once gave a bribe of Rs10,000
when he was caught in cockfight

878
01:16:09,242 --> 01:16:12,417
But that phone is
very important for me.

879
01:16:12,617 --> 01:16:15,558
Please take this home
if it is that important.

880
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:20,954
Sir that is very important,
please inform if you find it.

881
01:16:21,154 --> 01:16:23,426
Sure, we will inform you.

882
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:33,334
[mobile ringing] Shiva
Bullabbai is calling.

883
01:16:34,692 --> 01:16:38,547
-Hello...
-What did he say?

884
01:16:38,747 --> 01:16:39,886
He said it takes time.

885
01:16:40,086 --> 01:16:43,644
Of course it takes time! Finding
something is not as easy as losing it.

886
01:16:43,844 --> 01:16:46,888
-Did he tell that I called?
-He also told that he didn't answer.

887
01:16:47,088 --> 01:16:50,009
Oh he told that too? What is Sasi doing?

888
01:16:52,634 --> 01:16:54,920
-She's been crying all the time.
-Aren't you feeling bad?

889
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,988
-Hey
-Ok, listen to me.

890
01:16:58,188 --> 01:17:02,556
Stop crying, and go to every place in
Hyderabad where they'd buy mobile seconds.

891
01:17:02,756 --> 01:17:05,953
Also where they'd unlock iphones.

892
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,319
-Do you think I'd find it?
-Definitely!

893
01:17:09,519 --> 01:17:12,588
The one who found it might keep it,
but who stole will sell it for sure.

894
01:17:12,788 --> 01:17:16,597
You think unlocking an iphone
is as easy as unlocking a door?

895
01:17:16,797 --> 01:17:19,623
Do you even know how complicated the
process is? Moreover you bargain!

896
01:17:19,823 --> 01:17:24,115
-You have to pay not less than Rs2000!
-Big deal, I'd go to some other shop

897
01:17:25,106 --> 01:17:27,749
-Which model do you want to unlock?
-iphone 6S

898
01:17:27,949 --> 01:17:29,530
-Which country model?
-India.

899
01:17:29,664 --> 01:17:31,590
Then why do you want to unlock sir?

900
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:35,952
If someones brings that model,
please call me. This is my number.

901
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,063
I will pay you for this favour.

902
01:17:38,963 --> 01:17:43,878
Street sellers: Exchange your old
phone to new one. Please come!

903
01:17:44,078 --> 01:17:46,090
You are quoting too high a price!

904
01:17:47,056 --> 01:17:49,886
-Do you have iphone 6S?
-We have iphone 7.

905
01:17:50,086 --> 01:17:54,031
We have got an iphone
yesterday. Show him that.

906
01:17:54,231 --> 01:17:55,481
Ok sir.

907
01:17:56,599 --> 01:18:00,065
-It's not mine, mine is Silver colour.
-Mine? What are you saying?

908
01:18:00,265 --> 01:18:03,409
I lost my phone yesterday,
so thought I'd check if they sold it here.

909
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:07,870
Are you kidding? Do we look
like we sell stolen mobiles? Get lost!

910
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:11,673
-I will pay you for it.
-Just leave! Shut up!

911
01:18:11,873 --> 01:18:14,190
-Leave!
-Please listen to me!

912
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,430
Don't waste our time. Go!

913
01:18:16,206 --> 01:18:20,123
-Hey get lost man!
-Move!

914
01:18:20,323 --> 01:18:24,110
[indistinct]

915
01:18:28,027 --> 01:18:29,285
[mobile ringing]

916
01:18:29,485 --> 01:18:33,305
Hey Sasi, where are you?
We all are waiting for you.

917
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:38,792
[sobbing] What happened Sasi?

918
01:18:43,019 --> 01:18:45,526
Ashok, I can't come to office today.

919
01:18:45,726 --> 01:18:50,475
[inaudible conversation]

920
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:54,329
Oh my God! How could you guys...

921
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:58,149
Ok, just stay with Shiva until you
find the phone. You will find it.

922
01:18:58,349 --> 01:19:01,525
Let me know if you need
any help, take care.

923
01:19:02,415 --> 01:19:04,699
-Hello
-Any progress?

924
01:19:04,899 --> 01:19:09,426
Not really, I tried very hard but no use

925
01:19:09,626 --> 01:19:13,527
I was very worried if you found it or
not from the last time I spoke to you.

926
01:19:13,727 --> 01:19:16,694
If it got me so worried, I can understand
what you both are going through.

927
01:19:17,565 --> 01:19:20,665
You take care of Sasi, she might
resort to any hasty decision with this.

928
01:19:20,865 --> 01:19:21,721
Ok.

929
01:19:28,356 --> 01:19:29,743
Please have some water Sasi.

930
01:19:30,847 --> 01:19:35,724
We have been trying in all ways possible.
I am sure, we will find the phone.

931
01:19:50,187 --> 01:19:54,477
Even if we lose that phone and
even if the video goes viral...

932
01:19:54,677 --> 01:19:58,619
I will not leave your side!

933
01:19:58,819 --> 01:20:00,377
Stay strong Sasi!

934
01:20:14,433 --> 01:20:19,694
Shiva, I feel that you have deliberately
hidden the phone to blackmail me.

935
01:20:35,835 --> 01:20:38,555
Are you mad? Have you lost your mind?

936
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:40,239
Do you know what crap
are you blabbering?

937
01:20:41,509 --> 01:20:43,215
[screams]

938
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:52,623
Will I blackmail you?
And for what?

939
01:20:53,939 --> 01:20:58,111
For your beauty? Is that
something I haven't seen?

940
01:20:59,201 --> 01:21:01,364
Is it for your money? Don't I have?

941
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:06,953
Damn you! I already lost mercy and
anger, now I feel disgusted with you.

942
01:21:07,874 --> 01:21:12,718
I feel like killing you,
as I can't, I kissed.

943
01:21:14,338 --> 01:21:18,553
Though you are trying to break up,
I am pleading that we'd stay together

944
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:20,856
That is my mistake!

945
01:21:21,056 --> 01:21:23,971
At any cost, I will find
the phone by evening.

946
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:27,093
I will delete the video right in front
of you and will go away from your life too

947
01:21:27,293 --> 01:21:32,425
Until then, you better don't talk
anything. I might kill you. Beware!

948
01:21:43,626 --> 01:21:45,008
[reviving the bike]

949
01:21:48,476 --> 01:21:53,558
"What kind of a heart is yours?
Why don't you throw it away?"

950
01:21:53,758 --> 01:21:56,370
"It has no mercy at all."

951
01:21:56,572 --> 01:22:02,556
"When you killed me with
beauty and when you hurt me"

952
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:05,684
"I always smiled"

953
01:22:06,184 --> 01:22:09,583
"Your embrace..."

954
01:22:09,783 --> 01:22:13,540
"...has now turned into a noose!"

955
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:18,000
"Your companionship..."

956
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,839
"...has turned into
an unfinished story"

957
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:27,675
"When we spent lovely time
staring into each other's eyes"

958
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:31,487
"Now you say that those moments hunt you?"

959
01:22:32,187 --> 01:22:36,632
"Though the ground is
shattering, I still walk with you"

960
01:22:36,832 --> 01:22:40,230
"Does my love look so mean to you?"

961
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:44,796
"Who stood by your side,
when you were in problems?"

962
01:22:44,996 --> 01:22:49,138
"Who is the witness for it?"

963
01:22:58,409 --> 01:23:04,151
"They lure with their intentions"

964
01:23:04,651 --> 01:23:08,584
"..later they drown us"

965
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:14,959
"By enduring the pain, this is the
consequence leave you in tears"

966
01:23:15,931 --> 01:23:19,800
"Is feeling pity the grave sin, man does?"

967
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,783
"If one understands that it's
all null, their life prospers"

968
01:23:24,483 --> 01:23:28,194
"Your embrace..."

969
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:33,119
"...has now turned into a noose!"

970
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:36,704
"Your companionship..."

971
01:23:36,904 --> 01:23:40,736
"...has turned into
an unfinished story"

972
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:51,140
Why did you stop here?

973
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:56,467
You haven't had anything since
morning. You will feel fatigue.

974
01:23:56,667 --> 01:23:58,940
I don't want anything.
You please have if you want.

975
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:03,716
[scoffs] You will need
energy to worry and fear too.

976
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:07,301
I will bring something to eat.

977
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:23,549
Sasi... Sasi...

978
01:24:23,749 --> 01:24:26,309
Did you see the girl who came
along, going somewhere?

979
01:24:26,509 --> 01:24:27,229
I don't know!

980
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:29,976
-Did you notice anything?
-A girl just went in an auto.

981
01:24:30,176 --> 01:24:32,022
Auto?

982
01:24:34,905 --> 01:24:38,814
Hey you are so beautiful!

983
01:24:39,014 --> 01:24:39,616
Who is this?

984
01:24:39,816 --> 01:24:45,074
-Do you want my name? Or your video?
-Which video?

985
01:24:45,274 --> 01:24:47,867
Oh sorry, it's not your video?
It could be a wrong number Bye!

986
01:24:48,067 --> 01:24:50,407
Hello please hold on, who
are you? what do you want?

987
01:24:50,607 --> 01:24:54,205
I want you, the same as
you looked in the video.

988
01:24:55,435 --> 01:24:58,015
But I promise,
I will not record the video.

989
01:25:00,641 --> 01:25:03,504
Please come, entertain
me and collect your phone.

990
01:25:03,704 --> 01:25:07,555
You have half an hours time.
I already messaged the address.

991
01:25:21,838 --> 01:25:23,289
Ashok?

992
01:25:24,213 --> 01:25:26,865
Yes, Miss Sasi, it's me!

993
01:25:30,717 --> 01:25:35,328
How can you do this to your friend?

994
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:38,525
Will you say yes,
if I ask you friendly?

995
01:25:38,725 --> 01:25:43,745
Look Sasi, I took one hour
permission from office and came.

996
01:25:43,945 --> 01:25:46,162
Just half an hour.

997
01:25:49,082 --> 01:25:54,362
Please Ashok! Don't do this.

998
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:59,967
I'm not that commercial. I don't need
everyday. I'm asking just for once.

999
01:26:00,167 --> 01:26:02,446
And just for half an hour.

1000
01:26:07,839 --> 01:26:12,037
Whoa! What a tempting video!

1001
01:26:15,001 --> 01:26:19,030
If you delay, your video will cross
1 million views in shortest time.

1002
01:26:48,753 --> 01:26:51,962
Is this scumbag your friend?

1003
01:26:54,599 --> 01:26:56,873
If he does such nasty things
can he be called a friend?

1004
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:08,695
Take out the video, take out the phone!

1005
01:27:08,895 --> 01:27:13,013
-I don't have it!
-He has it Shiva!

1006
01:27:13,213 --> 01:27:15,005
He has showed me earlier.

1007
01:27:15,205 --> 01:27:20,027
I swear I don't have it. As she is
already scared, I took advantage of it

1008
01:27:20,227 --> 01:27:21,499
You can check my phone!

1009
01:27:26,356 --> 01:27:29,907
Argh! Look, it's full of girls photos.

1010
01:27:30,107 --> 01:27:32,642
You will trust such wastrels.

1011
01:27:34,822 --> 01:27:37,180
...and suspect boys like me!

1012
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:41,475
Moreover you generalise and
abuse all men saying 'Bloody Men'

1013
01:27:42,616 --> 01:27:44,259
Damn it!

1014
01:27:48,536 --> 01:27:53,804
When in trouble, one must seek
a solution but not another problem.

1015
01:27:55,606 --> 01:27:57,016
You bloody rascal!

1016
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:07,952
Damn you!

1017
01:28:16,502 --> 01:28:19,177
[mobile ringing]

1018
01:28:23,562 --> 01:28:26,543
-Hello
-Do you remember Rambabu?

1019
01:28:26,743 --> 01:28:29,419
-Yeah!
-He now owns cars!

1020
01:28:29,619 --> 01:28:31,755
How does it matter to
me in this situation?

1021
01:28:31,955 --> 01:28:34,965
Listen, guess what he does...

1022
01:28:35,165 --> 01:28:38,263
He collects such video and
gives for the websites.

1023
01:28:38,463 --> 01:28:41,856
He receives a bunch on
Thursday and uploads them on Friday

1024
01:28:42,056 --> 01:28:45,134
Today is Friday, check if your video is...

1025
01:28:45,842 --> 01:28:46,908
Where can I find him?

1026
01:28:48,027 --> 01:28:52,742
Why didn't I receive the videos yet? If I
don't receive by evening, I'll bash you.

1027
01:28:52,942 --> 01:28:54,527
I hope you know about me!

1028
01:28:54,727 --> 01:28:57,891
-Rambabu..
-Hey Shiva... how are you?

1029
01:28:59,302 --> 01:29:01,559
Bullabbai just called
and told me the matter.

1030
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,757
-What did he say?
-That it's a video of your colleague.

1031
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:08,783
Let's go!

1032
01:29:08,983 --> 01:29:13,088
How's Bullabbai doing?
Is he still boozing the same?

1033
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,860
Hmm! Come on finish it!

1034
01:29:24,986 --> 01:29:27,534
I received a total of
36 videos this week.

1035
01:29:27,734 --> 01:29:31,136
Actually I must not be showing these to
anyone. My partner won't spare me for it.

1036
01:29:31,336 --> 01:29:35,144
Since you are from my hometown
and it's Bullabbai's recommendation

1037
01:29:35,344 --> 01:29:36,990
Check out!

1038
01:29:42,728 --> 01:29:47,133
Ok, you check out.
Hey come we'll have a cigarette.

1039
01:29:55,904 --> 01:29:59,068
"They roam around saying
they like each other"

1040
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:02,060
"They keep kissing and
making love all day"

1041
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:05,055
"They lose the track of time."

1042
01:30:05,255 --> 01:30:08,024
"They hang together all day and night"

1043
01:30:08,224 --> 01:30:11,048
"Will oblige to each other"

1044
01:30:11,248 --> 01:30:15,455
"If you say ok, it goes ahead
from kissing and hugging"

1045
01:30:15,655 --> 01:30:18,484
"On the name of dating, they
invite saying there's none at home"

1046
01:30:18,684 --> 01:30:20,510
"In case that plan is missed"

1047
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,284
"They'd book an OYO room"

1048
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:26,103
"They walk and ride bike all day long"

1049
01:30:26,303 --> 01:30:29,098
"They will be caught on
camera, from behind the bushes"

1050
01:30:29,298 --> 01:30:32,098
"They don't even spare
the lifts, like idiots"

1051
01:30:32,298 --> 01:30:34,996
"They keep kissing
anywhere and everywhere"

1052
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:38,083
"They booze, they dance and throw up too"

1053
01:30:38,283 --> 01:30:41,056
"They will be busy
fulfilling their desires"

1054
01:30:41,256 --> 01:30:45,586
"They don't even
bother where they are"

1055
01:30:45,786 --> 01:30:47,632
"They will be caught to
someone or the other"

1056
01:30:47,832 --> 01:30:51,854
"Oh dude, did you watch the video?"

1057
01:30:52,054 --> 01:30:56,447
Shiva, send me the photos we
clicked yesterday, I want them

1058
01:30:56,947 --> 01:30:59,130
My phone is right there,
send them to your phone.

1059
01:31:09,182 --> 01:31:10,871
Huh? Shiva...

1060
01:31:20,584 --> 01:31:21,633
How did this get recorded?

1061
01:31:32,657 --> 01:31:35,249
-It's good, isn't it?
-Delete it!

1062
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:36,730
Delete it right away!

1063
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:40,912
Let it be Sasi!
It might help us sometime.

1064
01:31:43,325 --> 01:31:44,224
[grunts]

1065
01:32:01,844 --> 01:32:03,596
Did you find it?

1066
01:32:09,964 --> 01:32:13,088
-I'm sorry Rambabu!
-You need not thank me.

1067
01:32:13,288 --> 01:32:14,707
Why does he thank me...

1068
01:32:17,644 --> 01:32:19,116
Why did he apologise?

1069
01:32:26,754 --> 01:32:30,873
Damn! Argh!

1070
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:37,825
Hey Shiva!

1071
01:32:43,046 --> 01:32:45,206
-What do you want Ma'am?
-Coffee

1072
01:32:45,406 --> 01:32:46,376
Ok Ma'am.

1073
01:32:46,576 --> 01:32:50,480
Today a couple's video is
going viral in Hyderabad.

1074
01:32:50,783 --> 01:32:56,168
Are they lovers or a
newly married couple?

1075
01:32:56,368 --> 01:33:00,087
Whosoever, but their lives are
now in the hands of Netizens.

1076
01:33:00,287 --> 01:33:05,128
Is it their mistake in hastiness
or their parents' upbringing?

1077
01:33:08,751 --> 01:33:11,598
Why did you do it Sasi? Where are you?

1078
01:33:11,798 --> 01:33:14,963
Everyone at office talks
about your body structure.

1079
01:33:15,163 --> 01:33:18,609
Hey sasi, is too hot!

1080
01:33:20,222 --> 01:33:22,815
Hey Shiva... You are a lucky boy!

1081
01:33:24,388 --> 01:33:25,512
[mobile ringing]

1082
01:33:25,912 --> 01:33:30,290
What's wrong with you?
I never expected this from you.

1083
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:34,054
Did you even think of your parents,
what if they come to know this?

1084
01:33:41,605 --> 01:33:44,081
They punished themselves!

1085
01:33:44,281 --> 01:33:49,043
Did their parents kill themselves?

1086
01:34:01,015 --> 01:34:02,744
[tires screech, thud]

1087
01:34:02,944 --> 01:34:04,265
[gasps]

1088
01:34:23,767 --> 01:34:26,651
What did you do? If you didn't find
the video, you must just leave,

1089
01:34:26,851 --> 01:34:28,373
...but why did you delete
all the videos there?

1090
01:34:28,473 --> 01:34:31,146
He wanted to help us,
in turn you ruined his business.

1091
01:34:32,146 --> 01:34:35,546
Bullabbai, do you call that a business?

1092
01:34:36,646 --> 01:34:39,822
Does he have to run a
business that ruins some lives?

1093
01:34:40,022 --> 01:34:42,174
That is why I deleted!

1094
01:34:42,374 --> 01:34:45,564
I am not thinking just about
myself since morning...

1095
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:48,515
I can sense the pain of
every single person's pain,

1096
01:34:48,715 --> 01:34:50,485
...whose life was ruined
due to such videos.

1097
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:54,806
I am very much worried about Sasi.

1098
01:34:55,006 --> 01:34:58,390
But I am just helpless.

1099
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:02,635
Hey remember this, we might not
be able to change the world...

1100
01:35:02,835 --> 01:35:07,032
...but we must at least try to
change the mind of our acquaintance.

1101
01:35:09,862 --> 01:35:13,201
Damn! Bloody fool!

1102

[mobile ringing]

1103
01:35:16,258 --> 01:35:17,172
Tell me!

1104
01:35:17,372 --> 01:35:20,529
He deleted them in his
frustration. Please try to understand.

1105
01:35:21,626 --> 01:35:25,533
I just wanted to help you as
you were my childhood friends.

1106
01:35:25,733 --> 01:35:28,377
I had to incur a loss of Rs 4 lakhs.

1107
01:35:28,577 --> 01:35:30,726
I must upload 6 videos by morning.

1108
01:35:30,926 --> 01:35:35,943
That's it? Do as I say, you can
upload 60 videos not just 6!

1109
01:35:36,143 --> 01:35:38,957
Come on tell me!

1110
01:35:39,157 --> 01:35:45,144
Place a camera each in your parent's
room, your brother's room and your room.

1111
01:35:45,444 --> 01:35:48,407
-You will have 3 videos ready by morning!
-Bullabbai!

1112
01:35:48,607 --> 01:35:50,721
Oh it slipped my mind,
yours is a joint family, isn't it?

1113
01:35:50,921 --> 01:35:54,388
If you place cameras in your uncle's,
sister's and other family members rooms...

1114
01:35:54,631 --> 01:35:57,432
...you will have as many videos
as you want by morning! What say?

1115
01:35:57,632 --> 01:36:02,013
Mind your words! I will kill you!

1116
01:36:02,213 --> 01:36:03,473
Why will I place a camera in my house?

1117
01:36:03,673 --> 01:36:07,902
Not just your house, if a camera is placed
in anyone's bedroom, it records the same!

1118
01:36:08,102 --> 01:36:10,426
It's called romance if done
in a closed room privately,

1119
01:36:10,626 --> 01:36:13,181
...but you are demeaning it
by exposing to the public.

1120
01:36:13,381 --> 01:36:18,316
Oh really? Why do you suddenly speak like
a good Shepard? You too watch, don't you?

1121
01:36:18,516 --> 01:36:20,724
I watched! Yeah a lot of them indeed!

1122
01:36:20,924 --> 01:36:25,741
But after seeing my friend's pain, I
decided not to watch such videos again.

1123
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:30,005
Similarly I wanted you to stop
this and spoke about your parents.

1124
01:36:30,205 --> 01:36:34,608
But I didn't mean to talk low
of them. I too have my family.

1125
01:36:34,808 --> 01:36:38,433
Shiva said this, we might not
be able to change the world...

1126
01:36:38,533 --> 01:36:40,760
...but we can change the
mind of our acquaintance.

1127
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,749
I have changed,
I leave the rest to you!

1128
01:36:42,949 --> 01:36:46,638
Remember, there are many
other ways to make money.

1129
01:36:57,045 --> 01:36:59,692
I never believed that you exist.

1130
01:37:00,789 --> 01:37:02,857
But Sasi believed in you.

1131
01:37:03,057 --> 01:37:06,262
Anyhow, she wouldn't
believe me from now on.

1132
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:10,102
At least you try to
keep up her trust in you.

1133
01:37:11,124 --> 01:37:15,026
Please make sure
we find that phone.

1134
01:37:16,555 --> 01:37:18,706
[temple bell rings]

1135
01:37:23,293 --> 01:37:24,314
Did you find the phone?

1136
01:37:34,253 --> 01:37:40,119
Shiva, I lost my hope!
We won't find the phone.

1137
01:37:41,048 --> 01:37:46,333
So since morning, did you
believe that we'd find it?

1138
01:37:48,528 --> 01:37:49,832
Yes!

1139
01:37:50,032 --> 01:37:53,730
Then please continue to have
the same faith until we find it.

1140
01:37:55,407 --> 01:37:59,567
Because I still believe that we'd find it.

1142
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:24,396
-Shiva our phone is switched on.
-What?

1143
01:38:28,065 --> 01:38:29,058
Call!

1144
01:38:29,258 --> 01:38:33,204
No, if we call, they
might switch it off again.

1145

1146
01:38:40,090 --> 01:38:42,849
Sasi, phone is somewhere nearby.

1147
01:38:43,869 --> 01:38:44,840
You keep tracking the GPS

1148
01:38:50,148 --> 01:38:51,747
-Should I go straight from here?
-Yes

1149
01:38:56,049 --> 01:38:57,374
Left or right from here.

1150
01:38:57,659 --> 01:39:02,106
Left, sorry right! No left! No.. no right!

1151
01:39:05,133 --> 01:39:07,075
You anyhow couldn't differentiate
between right and wrong.

1152
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:09,522
Can't you differentiate
left and right too?

1153
01:39:09,770 --> 01:39:12,194
Right!

1154
01:39:17,307 --> 01:39:21,279
They are at the signal
ahead Shiva. Fast! Fast!

1155
01:39:21,479 --> 01:39:24,023
-Give me the phone.
-He just took an U turn.

1156
01:39:24,223 --> 01:39:27,062
-Shiva, he stopped there.
-Where?

1157
01:39:27,262 --> 01:39:30,320
-It's just 2 minutes, fast Shiva.
-I'm speeding.

1158
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:33,272
Shiva he is just right
there. He's right there.

1159

-Shiv.. Shiv...
-What happened?

01:39:48,353 --> 01:39:51,528
-Shiva
-What happened?

1161
01:39:51,728 --> 01:39:53,869
They turned off the GPS.
What?

1162
01:39:56,387 --> 01:40:00,566
-Give me the phone. He's here.
-Yeah right here Shiva.

1163
01:40:00,766 --> 01:40:01,846
[grunts]

1164
01:40:04,378 --> 01:40:10,291
Sweetie! I love you dear!
I can't kiss you here dear.

1165
01:40:15,272 --> 01:40:18,085
-Sweetie... Just hold on!
-Sir... Sir...

1166
01:40:18,285 --> 01:40:19,237
What?

1167
01:40:19,437 --> 01:40:22,024
I lost my purse,
I have no money to go hometown.

1168
01:40:22,274 --> 01:40:24,061
-Paddu...
-Sir...

1169
01:40:24,261 --> 01:40:28,281
Sir, please take this phone,
and give me Rs 5000.

1170
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:31,513
-These are duplicates!
-No sir, it's a branded one.

1171
01:40:31,713 --> 01:40:33,148
-Sir...
-Someone is bugging me here dear...

1172
01:40:33,348 --> 01:40:36,618
GPS shows the same spot Sasi. Argh!

1173
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:41,025
-Please take the phone and give me money.
-I don't have any.

1174
01:40:44,335 --> 01:40:47,129
I can go to my hometown
if you give me money,

1175
01:40:49,469 --> 01:40:51,940
Whilst I drank the alcohol
and are you feeling giddy?

1176
01:40:58,372 --> 01:41:01,583
Hey you! Sasi you wait here.

1177
01:41:01,783 --> 01:41:04,091
Hey you stay put!

1178
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:06,150
Sir I will meet you again!

1179
01:41:06,165 --> 01:41:07,095
Stop there!

1180
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:13,159
Hey!

1181
01:41:20,389 --> 01:41:21,600
Shiva...

1182
01:41:24,467 --> 01:41:25,835
Shiva...

1183
01:41:39,948 --> 01:41:42,684
Hey...

1184
01:41:49,415 --> 01:41:54,214
[peppy dance number playing on TV]

1185
01:42:00,349 --> 01:42:04,198
Why did you come
running? Is police chasing you?

1186
01:42:04,398 --> 01:42:06,903
-No bro.
-Did you sell the phone or not?

1187
01:42:07,834 --> 01:42:09,527
[Shiva panting]

1188
01:42:16,629 --> 01:42:20,653
Please brother, return my phone.
I will pay you any amount you ask for.

1189
01:42:20,853 --> 01:42:23,480
If you could pay so much, why don't
you buy a new phone for yourself?

1190
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:25,946
Why did you sprint for it?

1191
01:42:36,636 --> 01:42:41,147
A romantic video from a park
in Bengaluru is going viral.

1192
01:42:41,347 --> 01:42:45,981
We have heard of videos
that were secretly shot.

1193
01:42:46,181 --> 01:42:51,149
But now the couples deliberately
shoot them as sweet memories

1194
01:42:51,349 --> 01:42:54,573
If a couple came chasing
for phone, it means...

1195
01:42:54,773 --> 01:42:57,720
there might be some
secret romantic videos in it.

1196
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,547
I beg you! Please return my phone.

1197
01:43:01,747 --> 01:43:04,033
I feel pity looking at them,
give the phone here.

1198
01:43:12,502 --> 01:43:13,386
Shiva!

1199
01:43:13,586 --> 01:43:16,318
-Leave me!
-Let me go!

1200
01:43:19,016 --> 01:43:20,332
Please leave me!

1201
01:43:20,532 --> 01:43:24,589
We have seen many romance videos,
shall we record an assault video?

1202
01:43:24,789 --> 01:43:28,262
-Shall we?
-We shall dude!

1203
01:43:28,462 --> 01:43:31,083
We shall do it!

1204
01:43:36,805 --> 01:43:39,596
Don't do this, such
criminals are being shot.

1205
01:43:42,836 --> 01:43:45,166
True, let's not do this.

1206
01:43:47,998 --> 01:43:49,442
We won't do it.

1207
01:43:50,396 --> 01:43:56,314
Here's a bumper offer. Once your video
is exposed, the whole world watches it.

1208
01:43:56,614 --> 01:44:00,902
If you want to stop it, you both...

1209
01:44:01,102 --> 01:44:04,433
...must romance
in front of us.

1210
01:44:04,633 --> 01:44:06,695
What an idea bro!

1211
01:44:15,324 --> 01:44:17,007
Sasi, no! Don't do it!

1212
01:44:18,696 --> 01:44:20,255
I will kill you, if you move.

1213
01:44:21,289 --> 01:44:23,291
I will oblige.

1214
01:44:24,865 --> 01:44:27,383
No Sasi. Sasi, no!

1215
01:44:32,309 --> 01:44:35,820
No Sasi. Sasi, no!

1216
01:44:41,158 --> 01:44:42,450
No Sasi!

1217
01:44:44,901 --> 01:44:49,205
No Sasi. Sasi, no!

1218
01:44:53,505 --> 01:44:55,227
Whoa! Romance!

1219
01:45:12,056 --> 01:45:12,942
Sasi come on!

1220
01:45:19,649 --> 01:45:21,941
Sasi come! Sasi!

1221
01:45:24,582 --> 01:45:27,551
Phone! It's still with them!

1222
01:45:27,751 --> 01:45:30,131
They don't have our phone.

1223
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:34,200
There's no iphone in the lot
I robbed at bar yesterday.

1224
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:34,806
Shut up!

1225
01:45:35,006 --> 01:45:39,493
In fact, even if they had our
phone, I still would have saved you.

1226
01:45:41,028 --> 01:45:45,079
Because, you mean a
lot more than the phone.

1227
01:45:58,232 --> 01:46:02,113
They locked us up and escaped.
Don't spare them. Kill them!

1228
01:46:02,213 --> 01:46:03,170
Ok bro!

1229
01:46:04,354 --> 01:46:05,589
Shiva...

1230
01:46:21,014 --> 01:46:22,444
Shiva...

1231
01:46:30,208 --> 01:46:33,729
Who the hell are you man?
How dare you lock our men?

1232
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:37,730
I am already out of my
mind! Don't mess with me!

1233
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:39,099
Then why don't you
go to an asylum?

1234
01:46:42,850 --> 01:46:44,489
Hey, round him up!

1235
01:46:44,689 --> 01:46:46,169
Come on!

1236
01:46:53,049 --> 01:46:53,830
Shiva...

1237
01:47:35,078 --> 01:47:38,211
How dare you try to kill us! Try it now!

1238
01:47:42,214 --> 01:47:44,025
Shiva! Spare him!

1239
01:47:57,469 --> 01:47:58,510
Idiot!

1240
01:48:06,253 --> 01:48:09,112
When you are by my
side, I am the happiest!

1241
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,465
Sasi... Sasi...

1242
01:49:12,275 --> 01:49:13,577
-Leave me!
-What are you doing?

1243
01:49:13,977 --> 01:49:15,225
Come!

1244
01:49:22,666 --> 01:49:23,811
Are you out of your mind?

1245
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,101
What do I do?

1246
01:49:28,885 --> 01:49:31,761
I am clueless, my life is
so fragile at this point.

1247
01:49:36,035 --> 01:49:39,811
I am dying every
moment since morning.

1248
01:49:40,772 --> 01:49:42,673
I can't take this anymore Shiva!

1249
01:49:43,324 --> 01:49:44,896
-I want to die!
-Stop it!

1250
01:49:47,315 --> 01:49:49,319
Will we find the phone if you die?

1251
01:49:50,643 --> 01:49:52,706
Or will it stop the video
from being exposed?

1252
01:49:59,265 --> 01:50:01,809
If death was the
solution to every problem...

1253
01:50:02,450 --> 01:50:05,308
...every person must die for
the first problem he faces.

1254
01:50:07,652 --> 01:50:11,880
We have tried in every way
possible and we will continue to...

1255
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:17,137
If we still don't find the phone?

1256
01:50:31,839 --> 01:50:33,724
Look Sasi, it was our fault.

1257
01:50:37,032 --> 01:50:42,178
If we can't correct it, we must
be prepared for the punishment.

1258
01:50:46,203 --> 01:50:50,025
Let us face it! We shall face
all the consequences arising.

1259
01:50:51,787 --> 01:50:56,844
I will make sure I will stand tall
and not let any problem affect you.

1260
01:50:59,992 --> 01:51:04,302
I will be with you, in support of you.

1261
01:51:13,497 --> 01:51:16,326
Thanks! Thank you so much Shiva.

1262
01:51:20,118 --> 01:51:23,033
Let's face any kind of
problem thus arising.

1263
01:51:25,243 --> 01:51:29,407
But not together...

1264
01:51:30,525 --> 01:51:31,823
...staying separate!

1265
01:51:33,108 --> 01:51:39,013
Because I decided to part,
before you lost the phone.

1266
01:51:42,153 --> 01:51:43,536
Please don't try to stop me!

1267
01:51:47,375 --> 01:51:52,469
"I hold you in my heart"

1268
01:51:53,594 --> 01:51:56,525
"You hold me in your heart"

1269
01:51:56,725 --> 01:52:01,073
"Not sure how the
love has changed"

1270
01:52:13,662 --> 01:52:18,397
"Shall I get parted away from him?"

1271
01:52:19,752 --> 01:52:22,126
?Should I ask him for an answer??

1272
01:52:23,089 --> 01:52:25,757
?Is it love that's
hiding in the heart??

1273
01:52:25,957 --> 01:52:29,670
Pack these too Sasi, you might need them!

1274
01:52:32,252 --> 01:52:35,628
-Do you know when you'd use tablets?
-When we are down with fever.

1275
01:52:35,850 --> 01:52:39,617
No! When there's
none to take care of...

1276
01:52:39,817 --> 01:52:41,563
and the one who's there
can't take care of...

1277
01:52:41,763 --> 01:52:44,164
But I am here to look after you!

1278
01:52:45,609 --> 01:52:50,326
"I hold you in my heart"

1279
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:54,825
"You hold me in your heart"

1280
01:52:55,025 --> 01:52:59,400
"Not sure how the
love has changed"

1281
01:53:01,470 --> 01:53:06,209
"Shall I get parted away from him?"

1282
01:53:07,963 --> 01:53:09,290
Sasi, one last word,
before you leave

1283
01:53:11,694 --> 01:53:15,721
Please check if you have
left any of your belongings!

1284
01:53:18,593 --> 01:53:19,710
Because you aren't
planning to come back!

1285
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:24,776
?My heart is...?

1286
01:53:26,687 --> 01:53:31,801
?Yours!?

1287
01:53:32,001 --> 01:53:37,026
?My heart is...?

1288
01:53:38,646 --> 01:53:43,188
?Yours!?

1289
01:53:43,388 --> 01:53:46,148
-Just two spoons!
-Argh! Don't force me to!

1290
01:53:48,552 --> 01:53:54,340
Sorry Shiva, I hope you understand,
we'd have mood swings during this period.

1291
01:53:55,113 --> 01:53:59,053
Come on Sasi, why do you
even explain? I know!

1292
01:54:00,346 --> 01:54:01,859
I respect you as a girl first...

1293
01:54:02,059 --> 01:54:04,920
after that I love you as my girl!

1294
01:54:07,726 --> 01:54:12,869
I must done a lot of mistakes in my life!

1295
01:54:13,069 --> 01:54:15,407
But choosing you is the
best decision of my life.

1296
01:54:21,390 --> 01:54:23,402
Lately you don't love me
as much as you used to.

1297
01:54:23,602 --> 01:54:24,943
You don't pay any attention to me.

1298
01:54:26,463 --> 01:54:29,790
Any boy feels excited
while he proposes a girl...

1299
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:32,762
but it won't last after
the girl accepts his love.

1300
01:54:32,962 --> 01:54:37,843
Because he fear rejection from the girl...

1301
01:54:38,043 --> 01:54:42,664
later he feels assured,
that she belongs to him.

1302
01:54:44,659 --> 01:54:49,419
Fear is always makes you restless,
but assurance gives you peace!

1303
01:54:53,106 --> 01:54:56,063
Shiva, what if we fight in future?

1304
01:54:57,362 --> 01:55:01,587
I will... kiss you!
What if I am angry with you?

1305
01:55:01,787 --> 01:55:05,565
-I too will kiss you!
-Then I'll always be angry with you!

1306
01:55:09,077 --> 01:55:14,847
Once I made a mistake choosing a wrong
person, I corrected that by choosing you

1307
01:55:16,986 --> 01:55:19,694
I love you forever, ever and ever!

1308
01:55:26,072 --> 01:55:27,790
[gasps]

1309
01:55:27,990 --> 01:55:30,647
Leaving you, will happen only
when I take my last breath Sasi!

1310
01:55:30,847 --> 01:55:36,441
?Shall I return??

1311
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:40,887
?Shall I return??

1312
01:55:41,087 --> 01:55:45,877
?My heart says to go back to you?

1313
01:55:46,077 --> 01:55:49,778
Didn't you feel like stopping me?

1314
01:55:51,861 --> 01:55:53,709
Will you leave me like this?

1315
01:55:57,181 --> 01:55:59,493
Will you send me off?

1316
01:56:10,513 --> 01:56:15,226
"In your love, I am the bank which
has surrendered itself to the tide"

1317
01:56:16,611 --> 01:56:22,250
?I am that little boy who
feels sleepless in joy?

1318
01:56:23,332 --> 01:56:28,250
?Not a moment exists,
when I don't think of you?

1319
01:56:29,406 --> 01:56:34,609
?I am blessed to share my life with you?

1320
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:47,484
?Is this pain? Or the joy
that I found my special one??

1321
01:56:48,812 --> 01:56:53,319
?I don't exist without her?

1322
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,244
Why didn't you stop me?

1323
01:57:02,444 --> 01:57:05,661
Did you say,
?Don't try to stop me??

1324
01:57:05,861 --> 01:57:11,821
So you wanted me to stay back,
but you didn't think of stopping me?

1325
01:57:15,014 --> 01:57:19,336
Not really! But I guess, you
are good at mind reading.

1326
01:57:19,536 --> 01:57:22,618
Why couldn't you know
what's on my mind?

1327
01:57:23,618 --> 01:57:25,526
But I did come downstairs!

1328
01:57:26,326 --> 01:57:28,542
I wouldn't have gone,
even if you hadn't come.

1329
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:39,964
-I love you Sasi!
-I love you too!

1330
01:57:42,126 --> 01:57:46,242
How could you manage to hide
so much love since morning?

1331
01:57:46,442 --> 01:57:48,434
You are the reason again!

1332
01:58:08,133 --> 01:58:10,482
Excuse me... will you stop it?

1333
01:58:13,232 --> 01:58:15,086
Say sorry!

1334
01:58:16,993 --> 01:58:18,199
-Sorry?
-Yes!

1335
01:58:18,399 --> 01:58:20,644
-But why?
-Why... my foot!

1336
01:58:20,844 --> 01:58:22,760
-Hey, come here!
-Hi uncle!

1337
01:58:23,258 --> 01:58:26,592
Yeah your uncle! My boy daily comes
to your house to play, doesn't he?

1338
01:58:26,792 --> 01:58:27,921
Yes, so?

1339
01:58:28,121 --> 01:58:31,051
I hope you know that toys
aren't allowed to school.

1340
01:58:32,331 --> 01:58:35,235
Yeah, they won't allow,
but why do you tell me this?

1341
01:58:35,435 --> 01:58:39,283
When you knew this, why did you give
your phone to play and take along?

1342
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:12,491
Why did you give it sir?
Come on speak out! Why?

1343
01:59:12,691 --> 01:59:14,680
Why did you give him your phone?

1344
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:27,374
Uncle, please wake up!

1345
01:59:28,212 --> 01:59:31,145
-What?
-I want your phone!

1346
01:59:31,345 --> 01:59:32,965
I will play PUB G ad return it.

1347
01:59:33,165 --> 01:59:35,963
It lies somewhere here around, take it!

1348
01:59:36,953 --> 01:59:38,189
Thanks uncle!

1349
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:46,471
-Good morning!
-Ma'am is here, hide it!

1350
01:59:51,813 --> 01:59:52,783
[mobile vibrating]

1351
01:59:52,983 --> 01:59:55,695
-Phone is ringing!
-Silence!

1352
01:59:57,067 --> 01:59:57,820
[automated voice: The number you
have called is busy at the moment]

1353
01:59:58,020 --> 01:59:59,926
-Someone disconnected the call!
-Call again!

1354
02:00:01,670 --> 02:00:02,651
[mobile vibrating]

1355
02:00:02,851 --> 02:00:05,826
Someone's calling again! Switch it off!

1356
02:00:06,026 --> 02:00:08,414
[automated voice: The number you are
trying to reach, is currently switched off]

1357
02:00:12,082 --> 02:00:13,949
-Shiva our phone is switched on.
-What?

1358
02:00:15,666 --> 02:00:17,742
He's almost there!

1359
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,360
-What happened?
-They turned off the GPS

1360
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:23,041
What? [grunts]

1361
02:00:23,241 --> 02:00:23,773
Shit!

1362
02:00:23,973 --> 02:00:27,594
Whoa! Shit!
I should be the one saying that!

1363
02:00:27,794 --> 02:00:33,521
Shit! All my relatives from all
over are calling to taunt me!

1364
02:00:33,721 --> 02:00:36,123
How could you give a phone to
your child and send him school?

1365
02:00:36,323 --> 02:00:39,447
So, say sorry!

1366
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:43,105
Sorry sir!

1367
02:00:43,305 --> 02:00:46,235
Yeah it was so simple isn't it?
But you...

1368
02:00:46,435 --> 02:00:50,347
...won't stop pointing fingers at
our parenting, and pamper them!

1369
02:00:50,547 --> 02:00:54,068
-I won't spare you...
-Hello! We apologized to you!

1370
02:00:54,268 --> 02:00:56,562
Stop this here!

1371
02:00:56,762 --> 02:00:58,778
[sighs] I will!

1372
02:00:59,769 --> 02:01:02,021
Uncle asked to stop it, let's go!

1373
02:01:02,221 --> 02:01:05,156
Bye uncle, I will come
tomorrow to play the game!

1374
02:01:05,356 --> 02:01:07,170
Enough of your stupid games!

1375
02:01:21,734 --> 02:01:24,480
-Shall we go home miss?
-Ok mister!

1376
02:01:30,753 --> 02:01:34,627
A video we thought we'd keep it for fun,
has put us through a lot of problems!

1377
02:01:34,827 --> 02:01:36,432
Yeah, a lot indeed!

1378
02:01:36,632 --> 02:01:40,864
We must not save such videos.
No, we must even record them.

1379
02:01:41,064 --> 02:01:43,499
Yeah, they must be recorded in our minds.

1380
02:01:43,699 --> 02:01:46,910
We can recollect them whenever
we want, by just closing our eyes

1381
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:51,335
Right! Also must not entertain
neighbouring kids by giving phones to play

1382
02:01:51,535 --> 02:01:52,285
This is true!

1383
02:01:52,485 --> 02:01:55,670
Sasi, I remember you saying
your friend would refer me.

1384
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:57,148
Please find out when I
can attend the interview.

1385
02:01:57,348 --> 02:02:00,208
-Shiva, are you thinking of joining a job?
-Hmm, I will!

1386
02:02:00,408 --> 02:02:03,660
By the way, when you decided
to leave, why did you stop?

1387
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:04,571
Memories!

1388
02:02:04,771 --> 02:02:08,871
A fond memory has a strength
to overcome a hundred problems!

1389
02:02:09,168 --> 02:02:11,479
-I have many such memories with you!
-Me too!

1390
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:14,951
So recollect your good
memories to avoid break ups!

1391
02:02:37,709 --> 02:02:40,241
Dude, where are you?
I'm at your house.

1392
02:02:40,441 --> 02:02:41,237
Why have you come?

1393
02:02:41,437 --> 02:02:45,423
When my friend is going through so much
trouble, how can I stay peaceful at home?

1394
02:02:45,623 --> 02:02:47,796
That is why I am here.
What about the video?

1395
02:02:47,996 --> 02:02:50,654
Yeah I found it!
[sighs deeply]

1396
02:02:52,557 --> 02:02:56,328
-Come upstairs!
-Have I ever come to you flat?

1397
02:02:56,528 --> 02:02:57,447
You come downstairs,
we'll go to the bar!

1398
02:02:57,647 --> 02:03:01,065
You go, I'd join in sometime.

1399
02:03:01,265 --> 02:03:03,610
Listening to you blushing, I can sense it!

1400
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:07,489
Fine, but be careful that your
phone camera is not turned on

1401
02:03:07,689 --> 02:03:09,178
Argh! Ok sure!

1402
02:03:10,922 --> 02:03:12,903
Bullabbai... is a good friend!

1403
02:03:14,705 --> 02:03:16,455
Auto!
