00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,500
reason behind this pressmeet is

4
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
from 2,3 months

5
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,200
in our station limit

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,000
there has been 5-6 complaints regarding robbery in houses of people who live alone

7
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:11,041
behind this robbery

8
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,689
with the doubt that velayudham gang might have commited this

9
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:15,989
created team and started ground work

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,500
today morning at 6 am

11
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,730

with the information that they will be sold to merchant in koligudda

13
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:27,087
we caught them along with mall(loot)

14
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:32,398

00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:26,999
-what? even your station has been robbed??

350
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,049
-yes man

351
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:30,301
Seth's shop jewellery had beeen robbed,

352
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:34,675
i had recovered that mall and kept in locker
and i kept key with me

353
00:26:35,397 --> 00:26:37,497
when i wake up at morning and saw
locker is locked like before

354
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:38,501
but inside there is no mall(loot)

355
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:41,037
i cant even understand what's happening?

356
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:44,699
in the same style in front of press meet

357
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,970
both of them are robbed

358
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:49,579
-how is that possible?
-even i cant understand that

359
00:26:49,581 --> 00:26:52,705
even pressmeet knows everything about mall
which we have recovered

360
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:54,731
after calling jewellery owners

361
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,260
we have to do mall identification
and should submit to court

362
00:26:57,262 --> 00:26:58,242
what shall i do now??

363
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,960
if SP comes to know about this
we will loose job

364
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:02,143
also have to go for jail

365
00:27:02,507 --> 00:27:03,907
to solve this case,

366
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,856
a very good officer required

367
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:07,856
means,

368
00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:10,730
can we officially handle this case?

369
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,400
submitting this case to private detective
is better according to my opinion

370
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:15,901
what you are telling is ok man,

371
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,134
if he has robbed our station itself

372
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:20,207
imagine how genius he would be!!

373
00:27:20,211 --> 00:27:23,611
to catch such guy,even our
 detective should be genius

374
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:25,911
along with that he
should be trustworthy too

375
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,560
for that

376
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,550
in my station there is one genuis

377
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,600
hot ghee

378
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:45,239
if you swallow then
throat will burn

379
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,298
if you throw then
you will be caught

380
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:51,501
overall
difficult to breath situation

381
00:27:51,652 --> 00:27:53,252
now you only have
to do something Diwakara

382
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,496
we shall do something
dont worry

383
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:57,449
i will myself solve this case

384
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:00,447
but, i have my own conditions

385
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,247
what are those??

386
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,399
first one-from tommorow onwards
i will come to station whenever i wish

387
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,800
no one should ask why and what

388
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:13,699
ok

389
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,620
along with that
i require a jawa bike

390
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,950
my conditions are not finished

391
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,350
one more major condition
is remaining

392
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
whats that??

393
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:26,261
anyhow im in professional field

394
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:27,298
you should make some report

395
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:33,751
showing my unefficiency or may be
women harrasment or rude behaviour

396
00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:36,007
and somehow you should write false negative reports

397
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:38,657
should provide a report to department

398
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:40,608
and should remove myself
from this job

399
00:28:43,608 --> 00:28:45,008
are you even mad??

400
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,150
everyone die for promotion and increment

401
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:50,871
while you are telling to
remove you from job

402
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:51,919
by writing negative report

403
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,119
what else should i do swami??

404
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:56,369
dreamt of swimming in ocean

405
00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:57,618
but our father Annappa,

406
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,868
pushed me into the well
 which has no water

407
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:03,617
if my conditions are ok for you,
then your deal is ok for me

408
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,770
alright
your fate

409
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,320

410
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:09,911
shall i go??

411
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:26,708
this is the heartwrenching
story of Diwakar grandma

412
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:30,239
you are roaming without job like useless moron

413
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,140
what is the use of saving a guy like you??

414
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,220
die there itself

415
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
grandma

416
00:29:37,588 --> 00:29:38,988
instead of saving,you are
telling me to die and moving!!

417
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:39,910
granny crow

418
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:42,308
after hearing story

00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,510

 that you were grandmaa

427
00:30:01,351 --> 00:30:02,571
hear carefully

428
00:30:02,627 --> 00:30:07,627
you cant even find out who is girl

429
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,531
-and you also a detective(teases)
-dont make me angry

00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:14,729

because even i have fallen into a
hole which nearer to hole which you have fallen

435
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,929
even im tired of screaming for asking help like you

436
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:27,958
sat silently without getting any idea to come up same like you

437
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,847
after hearing your
screaming for help

438
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:31,459
i thought of making timepass so
simply acted like helping you

439
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:33,977
while im almost dying here
for you timepass ah?

440
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:40,478

442
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,180

443
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:49,979
instead of fighting

00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,830
how can i find a way??
this is minimum 15 feet

445
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:55,328
not even a single creeper or rope is there to try and climb up

446
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,410
if there is no creep plant whats the problem

447
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,986
isnt there any things
which are like rope??

448
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:58,650

449
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:01,167

00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:04,490
what are these man??

568
00:40:04,514 --> 00:40:07,228
this is the list of all
sevas that you get here sir!!

569
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:09,297

570
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:12,767
what is this owl seva??

571
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,200
when people who live in rented house
 wont pay rent to owners,

572
00:40:16,298 --> 00:40:18,806
thats when owners come and
 do this seva with us

573
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:21,468
we will place owls inside their house
without their knowledge

574
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,319
they leave house thinking
that it's bad sign

575
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:23,970
that's it

576
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,020
and you named this bullshit
job as seva ah?

577
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,920
what are parrot,rat and
 lizard sevas then??

578
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:31,701
these are all side business
profit is less in those

579
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,950
those who see horoscopy

580
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,750
like parrot,mouse and so on
we give these by mastering them

581
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:37,969
they earn their daily bread
because of us

582
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:39,399
and here you see this
lizard seva!!

583
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:42,423
no matter how many times you
need for hearing good sign or bad sign

584
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:45,513
just give me a signal
at that time lizard will make sound

585
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:47,828
how you master
those small lizards mann!!

586
00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:49,119
what are you saying sir!!

587
00:40:49,143 --> 00:40:53,019
the only thing which cannot be
mastered in this world is our tongue

588
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:54,962
other than that
we can master every animal

589
00:40:57,768 --> 00:41:00,468
this guy will even sell comb
for a bald guy

590
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:02,667

591
00:41:02,698 --> 00:41:04,198

00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:35,217
there is Kumbarapete Meenakshi theatre right?

702
00:47:35,309 --> 00:47:39,009
he does camphor,agarbatthi
and stays on back of that

703
00:47:40,462 --> 00:47:44,462
like Marakutuka told,
he might have done this

704
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,758
why Sagani(gobar) along with Pinto?

705
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,270
will you excrete gobar??

706
00:47:54,986 --> 00:47:56,786
if you place
then i will be gobar

707
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:59,009
if you roll that
then i will be compost

708
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:02,459
if you burn,
then i will be Vibhoothi(holy ash)

709
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:06,727
i collect gobar from surrounding people
and i prepare Vibhoothi

710
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:10,709
so people call me with love
Sagani Pinto

801
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:58,469
if one could become
brilliant just by eating

00:55:58,493 --> 00:56:00,728
carrot, then our goat would
have been scientist now

803
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:01,958

-so i came
-same for me also

813
00:58:53,521 --> 00:58:57,421
i came running with fear that fish
will die cause of evaporation of water

814
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,620
-Kusuma!
-dont you think we both think in same way!

815
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:05,668
isnt it! fish is like life for me
and even for you!!

816
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:09,457
if so, then why not we both
 should love each other?

817
00:59:10,398 --> 00:59:13,498
means... you have fallen
in love with me!

818
00:59:13,499 --> 00:59:14,899
i will promise upon this fish

819
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:16,879
-confirm right!
-100%!!

820
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,600
why late then? if we go to
register office just fifty rupees fees

821
00:59:20,628 --> 00:59:23,728
then bring two garlands, and
 one guy as proof from both sides

822
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,980
entire marriage will be finished
in just half an hour!

823
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:32,328
i will do all essential things that
has to be done in newly married couples house

824
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:35,109
also..let our first night
also be finished tonight itself..

825
00:59:35,111 --> 00:59:40,411
i didnt even finished 1 min conveying
my love but you have started even family!

826
00:59:40,428 --> 00:59:43,416
we should understand each other,
we should share our feelings

827
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,828
do you think
marriage is like kids play?

828
00:59:44,927 --> 00:59:46,627
then what you think
loving is kid's play?

829
00:59:46,681 --> 00:59:49,081
how did you love
without thinking anything?

830
00:59:49,081 --> 00:59:52,609
are you thinking of playing
since girl is beautiful?

831
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,073
there is huge difference in taste between
 those mangoes grown in trees and

832
00:59:55,097 --> 00:59:59,080
to those which are hybrid grown
by injecting chemicals

833
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,393
same way even this love is

834
01:00:00,461 --> 01:00:02,661
tip should grow into flower
flower should grow into seed

835
01:00:02,711 --> 01:00:04,611
then seed should
grow into fruit

836
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:06,008
understood?

837
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,129
1 minute

838
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:10,279
stand there!

839
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:13,859
i grown in mango farm

840
01:00:13,888 --> 01:00:15,888
even i know i seed
changes into fruit

841
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,590
you had given a sum right?

842
01:00:17,637 --> 01:00:18,537
i have solved

843
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:21,271
if you give six
then three remains at the end

844
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:25,019
if its four then remains two
half of the given sttones will be remained at end

845
01:00:25,067 --> 01:00:26,267
this is the trick right?

846
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:30,718
you have become brilliant after
joining me

847
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:37,091
dont shake much
you will be in first step if you fall

848
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,420
look after fish carefully

849
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,320
i didnt see anything

850
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,100
kusuma i love you

851
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,500
Karnataka state lottery
luck goddess is coming to your door step

852
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:14,619
who gets and who not!

853
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,980
-who is this monkey race sir?
-bless god

854
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:18,729
what are you doing here?

855
01:04:18,776 --> 01:04:21,776
i wanted to tell you something
so i came looking you

856
01:04:21,777 --> 01:04:23,477
-whats that?
-that is..

857
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:26,768
if you want to understand wolf
then be a goat

858
01:04:26,823 --> 01:04:30,023
if you want to understand a girl
then become a play boy

859
01:04:30,067 --> 01:04:32,067
our Beechi(famous poet) used to say

860
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:34,269
now tell me what you wanted to say

861
01:04:34,316 --> 01:04:39,016
ok then..
i think you are not handling case properly

862
01:04:39,071 --> 01:04:39,671
because,

863
01:04:39,677 --> 01:04:44,677
my opinion is we have to think
 like thief to catch a thief

864
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,780
you gobar

865
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,500
if i kick you i should clean my leg
and your advising me to catch thief

866
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:55,050
there is an quote that no one is younger than me
no is elder than Shivasharanas

867
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,000
im not eligible to advise you

868
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,280
thought of telling you
so i said

869
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:01,328
rest is upto you

870
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:02,529
i will go

871
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:04,777
forgot to say

872
01:05:04,928 --> 01:05:05,728
take this

873
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:10,981

they might have acted
to loot money

961
01:10:09,177 --> 01:10:13,877
how can they come inside when
many staffs are very much alert?

962

1172
01:26:51,868 --> 01:26:54,268
who all had came to station
during the night of robbery?

1173
01:26:54,329 --> 01:26:55,529

1174
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:59,277
brothers had came from Iduvani
because of land issue

01:26:59,327 --> 01:27:00,327

1176

give them 2 rupees there
itself and send them

1182
01:27:28,948 --> 01:27:30,648
first of all they have no house man!

1183
01:27:30,689 --> 01:27:34,889
their presence at spot during robbery
might be coincidence!

1184
01:27:34,937 --> 01:27:36,637

by singing and begging

1190
01:28:30,967 --> 01:28:32,467

1253
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:23,720

1269
01:36:15,477 --> 01:36:18,677

01:36:18,728 --> 01:36:20,628

-Sahadeva leave that gun

1275
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:37,789
this is more than enough
to play with them

1276
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,300
you are looking beautifull
in this dress

1277
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:14,670
you didnt even imagine that
i will be here right?

1278
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:16,270
why you are here?

1279
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:17,670
i came to give food

1280
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:18,470
where are they?

1281
01:37:18,549 --> 01:37:20,549
why that much concern towards them?

1282
01:37:20,549 --> 01:37:22,349
even i have same concern towards you

1283
01:37:23,212 --> 01:37:25,792
i wanted to enquire you

1284
01:37:25,809 --> 01:37:27,709
so i came to take you dragging

1285
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,808
please will you come?

1286
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,550
i thought you were
Sadhvi Bhisoo Raj Devi

1287
01:37:38,592 --> 01:37:40,992
but you are dacoit Poolan Devi

1288
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:43,290
-i know everything
-what you know?

1289
01:37:46,741 --> 01:37:47,741
Yashoda

1290
01:37:49,438 --> 01:37:50,438
Geetha

1291
01:37:51,219 --> 01:37:52,219
Mary Thomas

1292
01:37:55,367 --> 01:37:56,267
what are these?

1293
01:37:57,970 --> 01:37:59,470
i think now you will get clarity

1294
01:37:59,557 --> 01:38:01,757
this handwriting is yours only

1295
01:38:01,777 --> 01:38:02,977
so what should i do?

1296
01:38:03,029 --> 01:38:04,929
station was robbed by none other than you!

1297
01:38:04,929 --> 01:38:06,462
since you didnt get culprits,

1298
01:38:06,527 --> 01:38:08,027
are you trying to frame me into this?

1299
01:38:08,831 --> 01:38:09,931
the day robbery happened,

1300
01:38:09,931 --> 01:38:13,215
you have given complaint to
3 stations in different names

1301
01:38:13,277 --> 01:38:14,277
why?

1302
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,773
just because i have went
to watch Dasara, you are

1303
01:38:15,797 --> 01:38:18,080
blaming me for stealing
Ambari(God's monument)

1304
01:38:19,178 --> 01:38:21,778
what proof do you have to
prive me as thief?

1305
01:38:21,821 --> 01:38:24,521
even blind people have went for
all 3 stations the same day

1306
01:38:24,567 --> 01:38:26,267
what is the link between me and that?

1307
01:38:26,327 --> 01:38:28,127
without any link or relation
you came there to give them food ah?

1308
01:38:28,129 --> 01:38:30,029
is giving food for needy is crime?

1309
01:38:30,128 --> 01:38:33,328
same like me,many bring in this
city bring food for them

1310
01:38:34,678 --> 01:38:36,278
law requires proof

1311
01:38:36,278 --> 01:38:39,311
not your cooked up stories

1312
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,680
if you have guts,

1313
01:38:41,709 --> 01:38:42,909
prove me as thief

1314
01:38:42,961 --> 01:38:45,361
i will myself surrender in station

1315
01:38:45,429 --> 01:38:46,329
instead of that

1316
01:38:46,329 --> 01:38:49,649
if you try to swim without knowing it,
you will be drown

1317
01:38:50,582 --> 01:38:51,582
carefull!

1318
01:38:56,581 --> 01:38:59,981
according to law,
what she said is right

1319
01:39:00,057 --> 01:39:02,757
no case stands without evidence

1320
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:06,510
for law,
proof is more important than truth

1321
01:39:08,064 --> 01:39:09,264
what you were saying was right dad

1322
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:12,710
we cant become detectives just by
reading books and cinemas

1323
01:39:13,608 --> 01:39:16,008
even though accused was in front of me
i was helpless

1324
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,460
i cant do this dad

1325
01:39:19,558 --> 01:39:21,658
why you feel sad for that?

1326
01:39:21,661 --> 01:39:24,361
these are all common in our job

1327
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:28,110
only after burning,
pot becomes stronger

1328
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,300
in my life,
i never smoked a full cigerate

1329
01:39:50,339 --> 01:39:52,039
even after that, how
my hands burnt that day?

1330
01:39:52,490 --> 01:39:54,790
that also both me and Suneela

1331
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,900
means,

1332
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:21,400
did we lost our sense for 8 minutes that day?

1333
01:40:21,469 --> 01:40:24,369
physically no one injected us drugs

1334
01:40:24,369 --> 01:40:26,649
still we lost our sense

1335
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:30,620
is there a chance of injection of
drug or any other chemical in any other way?

1336
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:33,200
what did i eat that day?

1337
01:40:33,457 --> 01:40:34,657
what did i drink?

1338
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:28,300
will it be in powder form?

1339
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:47,270
whats this man?
my face has been powdered?

1340
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:06,800
after all by sparkling powder,

1341
01:42:06,891 --> 01:42:09,291
you made me loose my sense!

1342
01:42:11,391 --> 01:42:13,291
for the shock treatment we give to him,

1343
01:42:13,368 --> 01:42:15,568
he should permenantly sleep in coma

1344
01:42:15,618 --> 01:42:18,318
why are showing this much
anger towards me Boss?

1345
01:42:18,369 --> 01:42:21,669
every happiness is a
 missed tragedy

1346
01:42:21,718 --> 01:42:22,418
in the same way,

1347
01:42:22,418 --> 01:42:25,418
every tragedy is
missed happiness

1348
01:42:25,467 --> 01:42:26,667
isnt it?

1349
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:41,300

i didnt do station robbery

1363
01:43:18,969 --> 01:43:20,669
do you know what happened boss?

1364
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:55,800

1365
01:43:56,914 --> 01:43:59,214
oh L Board sir!

1366
01:43:59,307 --> 01:44:01,407

01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,400
now you go..

1370
01:44:26,187 --> 01:44:27,987
by applying leave for duty,

1371
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
while im struggling here
with case and all,

1372
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:35,900
are you playing hide and seek
with your Kidney?

1373
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:38,290
hey shut up

1374
01:44:38,343 --> 01:44:39,043

01:44:39,089 --> 01:44:41,589
what makes you bring sweets?

1376
01:44:41,791 --> 01:44:42,991
did you get any evidence?

1377
01:44:45,691 --> 01:44:47,791
why evidence?
i have caught even culprits!

1378
01:44:48,141 --> 01:44:48,841
what!!

1379
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:59,700
i cant believe that blind
people have involved in it!!

1380
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:01,640
thats the tricky point in this case dad

1381
01:45:01,738 --> 01:45:04,438
no one will believe that
they have robbed

1382
01:45:04,488 --> 01:45:06,888
in fact that case doesnt withstands in any courts

1383
01:45:06,888 --> 01:45:08,188
by taking this as advantage,

1384
01:45:08,188 --> 01:45:09,488
those have made this
job by using them(blind)

1385
01:45:09,509 --> 01:45:11,009
how is this possible after all?

1386
01:45:11,011 --> 01:45:14,311
first,the information of
mall in station was collected,

1387
01:45:14,387 --> 01:45:17,587
Kusuma used to go there with
the intention of giving complaint

1388
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:32,500
sir marks card was lost,

1389
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:33,730
i have to give complaint

1390
01:45:36,276 --> 01:45:38,976
how many staffs are there,

1391
01:45:39,038 --> 01:45:41,438
what is there in which place,

1392
01:45:41,438 --> 01:45:44,805
recovered mall is kept in which locker,

1393
01:45:44,818 --> 01:45:45,818
like that she used to observe
every things and matter

1394
01:45:47,190 --> 01:45:48,923
after that she returned to home,

1395
01:45:48,969 --> 01:45:51,169
upon a dress which has square shaped designs,

1396
01:45:51,218 --> 01:45:52,685
she used to stich Kavades(stones),

1397
01:45:52,699 --> 01:45:54,599
and prepared a map of station

1398
01:45:56,497 --> 01:45:57,897
after that,

1399
01:45:57,930 --> 01:46:02,330
she used to train us for robbery
using map contained kerchief

1400
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:26,100
means by making us to sleep
they used to rob in front of police itself ah?

1401
01:48:26,137 --> 01:48:27,637
yes sir

1402
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:29,640
she is very brilliant girl!

1403
01:48:31,245 --> 01:48:32,345
by the way..

1404
01:48:32,369 --> 01:48:35,769
just by this agarbatthi smell they used to sleep ah?
how is that?

1405
01:48:36,768 --> 01:48:39,068
they were loosing their sense not
through agarbatti smell dad,

1406
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:41,020
but because of a drug called
"Devils Breath"

1407
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:42,240
Devils Breath ah?

1408
01:48:42,286 --> 01:48:45,686
there is a plant called Datura
in Columbia nation

1409
01:48:45,758 --> 01:48:47,958
with the seed which came
 from fruit of this plant,

1410
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:50,110
they extract a drug called
"Devils Breath"

1411
01:48:50,259 --> 01:48:53,159
if we sprinkle this drug
into any person

1412
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:55,159
or even if someone breathes it

1413
01:48:55,258 --> 01:48:57,458
he will be stunned for eight minutes

1414
01:48:57,509 --> 01:49:00,209
he cant notice anything that
happens around during that time

1415
01:49:00,263 --> 01:49:02,451
this Devils Breath drug
was supplied to all of them,

1416
01:49:02,475 --> 01:49:04,763
in the form of
powder through Sagani Pinto

1417
01:49:06,292 --> 01:49:07,792
alas this asshole!!

1418
01:49:09,089 --> 01:49:11,089
how did Pinto get this drug?

1419
01:49:11,138 --> 01:49:12,838
it was supplied illegaly

1420
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:19,840
for all black magicians,
i used to supply

1421
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:22,260
means did you get
the lost mall?

1422
01:49:22,263 --> 01:49:23,263
no dad

1423
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:26,010
these Pinto gang had
only postman job

1424
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:28,910
there is a man
behind all of them

1425
01:49:28,958 --> 01:49:31,158
is it?
who is he?

1426
01:49:31,228 --> 01:49:33,928
he is much closer to you

1427
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:36,390
you also have meeted him once i say!

1428
01:49:36,489 --> 01:49:39,189
-Gurupada on it
-no no no

1429
01:49:39,222 --> 01:49:40,622
i will say

1430
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:43,620
black magician Nanjappa

1431
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,800
hey you brother!

1432
01:49:59,821 --> 01:50:02,888
why you hurt yourselves
by hitting me?

1433
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:10,120
even if you kill me
i wont reveal the secret!

1434
01:50:11,070 --> 01:50:13,370
i have given words to my Boss

1435
01:50:13,421 --> 01:50:16,921
my secret will be burried along with me

1436
01:50:22,069 --> 01:50:23,469
this is were i have stuck dad

1437
01:50:23,539 --> 01:50:26,939
oh my god!
what kind of network they have?

1438
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:30,440
only doubt is who is the
Boss behind Moadi Nanjappa

1439
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:33,940
that is...robbery happened in police station

1440
01:50:33,968 --> 01:50:37,068
whatever plan Kusuma does,

1441
01:50:37,141 --> 01:50:39,345
my doubt is that there might be an
Mastermind who knows

1442
01:50:39,369 --> 01:50:44,541
geography,biography of
the station behind this plan

1443
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:49,540
who is such mastermind
in our area?

1444
01:50:49,897 --> 01:50:50,997
ha i understood!

1445
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:53,650
-who?
-Marakutuka!!

1446
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,340
correct dad!
he didnt flashed to me!!

1447
01:50:58,340 --> 01:50:59,940
he was the only guy i had left

1448
01:51:00,021 --> 01:51:02,721
definitely!
he is the Boss of them

1449
01:51:02,768 --> 01:51:04,768
such small thing didnt flashed to me dad!

1450
01:51:04,768 --> 01:51:06,968
every culprit is in my surroundings itself

1451
01:51:07,018 --> 01:51:08,218
this is like,

1452
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:11,191
asking address with police
after stealing a car

1453
01:51:11,987 --> 01:51:13,287
what kind of police im!!

1454
01:51:13,287 --> 01:51:15,087
now every dot is connecting

1455
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:19,100
girl with beautiful pettycoat-Kusuma

1456
01:51:19,101 --> 01:51:22,001
eyes which never gets dream-Pinto

1457
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:25,800
black magician with mantras power-Moadi Nanjappa!

1458
01:51:25,847 --> 01:51:28,247
minister above him-Annappa!

1459
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:31,950
-which Annappa man!
-isnt it?

1460
01:51:31,950 --> 01:51:34,650
-he is Marakutuka
-yeah yeah sorry

1461
01:51:34,707 --> 01:51:36,507
now the thing is,

1462
01:51:36,507 --> 01:51:38,507
Kusuma gave the plan

1463
01:51:38,598 --> 01:51:41,298
Pinto gave Devils Breath powder

1464
01:51:41,348 --> 01:51:42,848
blind people did robbery

1465
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:47,450
Moady Nanjappa gave the robbed mall
to head constable Annappa

1466
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:52,160
why are you dying to say Annappa
it is Marakutuka

1467
01:51:52,208 --> 01:51:53,908
you are in illusion!

1468
01:51:58,169 --> 01:52:00,669
illusion? ah?

1469
01:52:02,597 --> 01:52:05,397
Kusuma and Annappa doesnt have any relation

1470
01:52:05,448 --> 01:52:07,648
still Kusuma comes to our house

1471
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:10,100
calls you father-in law heartfully

1472
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:17,800
Father in law?

1473
01:52:23,549 --> 01:52:26,249
my father himself sprinkled
Devils Breath upon me,

1474
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:27,840
makes me loose my sense

1475
01:52:29,357 --> 01:52:30,541
if he had seen then we
would have finished! carefull

1476
01:52:30,565 --> 01:52:32,257
-why you brought here?

1477
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,540
why you always will be in illusion?

1478

1479
01:52:40,689 --> 01:52:41,769

no body is there

1490
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:35,600
for every child,
his dad will be hero

1491
01:53:35,602 --> 01:53:37,502
why did you become villain dad?

1492
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:39,800
i thought your Sathya Harishchandra(symbol of truth)

1493
01:53:39,847 --> 01:53:41,547
why did you do this kind of work?

1494
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:45,099
to save those truth and justice what
Sathya Harishchandra believed

1495
01:53:45,101 --> 01:53:46,501
means?

1496
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:50,098
there was an institution named "Ashakirana" for blind
childrens in Iduvani

1497
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:53,680
even our Kusuma's sister was
studying in that institution

1498
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:05,600
if you eat all of this,
then i will buy you new clothes

1499
01:54:05,608 --> 01:54:07,108
-ok ah?
-sis!

1500
01:54:07,158 --> 01:54:09,158
i will stich you new clothes

1501
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,750
in that institution they
used to teach them

1502
01:54:21,774 --> 01:54:27,200
to stich bell bottom pants
and used to do marketing

1503
01:54:27,208 --> 01:54:29,608
since blind childrens were stiching the pants,

1504
01:54:29,608 --> 01:54:31,908
along with that because of that
new design

1505
01:54:31,989 --> 01:54:34,189
that Brand becaome popular very soon

1506
01:54:35,438 --> 01:54:37,238
everyone come

1507
01:54:37,389 --> 01:54:40,643
these are attractive
clothes of wonderful designs

1508
01:54:40,667 --> 01:54:43,889
prepared by blind children
of "Ashakirana" institution

1509
01:54:43,937 --> 01:54:47,893
these are the bell bottom pants
with low affordable prices and with best quality

1510
01:54:50,991 --> 01:54:55,091
just when their life was
coming to correct track,

1511
01:54:55,187 --> 01:54:56,786
Chamanlal Shet's interest
raised upon the land

1512
01:54:56,810 --> 01:54:59,787
in which "Ashakiran"
institution was there

1513
01:55:03,661 --> 01:55:06,161
sir that land is very nearer to city

1514
01:55:06,198 --> 01:55:09,198
if we build a cinema talkies there,

1515
01:55:09,199 --> 01:55:11,499
we can earn as much as we want

1516
01:55:15,431 --> 01:55:17,031
that Shet with the help
of inspectors,

1517
01:55:17,041 --> 01:55:19,341
planned to grab that land

1518
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:21,780
i have plan for that

1519
01:55:23,279 --> 01:55:24,179
see children

1520
01:55:24,481 --> 01:55:26,581
donars have come forward to
break this old building

1521
01:55:26,677 --> 01:55:28,677
and to build a new one

1522
01:55:28,681 --> 01:55:31,181
so we shall evacuate this
place for some days

1523
01:55:31,181 --> 01:55:32,881
we have to stay in
some other place

1524
01:55:32,957 --> 01:55:36,457
by telling lie, they made
all those children shelterless

1525
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:00,300
left them in a strange place at night

1526
01:56:00,378 --> 01:56:01,478
after that

1527
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:04,618
they created a fake record that
there were no children at that place

1528
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:06,630
to grab that land was their plan

1529
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:16,400
no sir,

1530
01:56:16,457 --> 01:56:19,157
can leave children here and go?

1531
01:56:19,211 --> 01:56:20,211
forest sir also dark night

1532
01:56:20,212 --> 01:56:23,412
they are children sir

1533
01:56:25,011 --> 01:56:28,211
there is no child of adult age
otherwise we could grabbed them

1534
01:56:30,012 --> 01:56:31,212
climb up man

1535
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,900
by loosing the institution which
was support for their life

1536
01:57:00,910 --> 01:57:03,610
they lost their mates and
also thrown into streets

1537
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:05,360
for personal reasons and money

1538
01:57:05,406 --> 01:57:07,506
for making damage to many
people's lives

1539
01:57:07,577 --> 01:57:09,277
upon those inspectors,

1540
01:57:09,301 --> 01:57:11,001
to take revenge

1541
01:57:11,050 --> 01:57:13,450

01:57:13,549 --> 01:57:15,049

that is

1697
02:07:10,107 --> 02:07:15,607
to their Agarbhathhi powder and
to this Rathnavarni leaves had farest relation

1698
02:07:15,609 --> 02:07:16,809
thats why

1699
02:07:16,857 --> 02:07:18,857
30 minutes prior to their
station going schedule,

1700
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:23,060
i used to feed dish of Rathnavarni leaves to them
