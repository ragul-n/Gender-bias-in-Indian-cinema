00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,998
Doctors cure people

189
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,464
They don't extract
healthy people's teeth.

190
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,998
what do fifth standard
fail and nursery fail know..

191
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,129

Can't all three of you
live without fighting?

196
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,202
At least listen to me

197
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,610
Exactly. Silly kids.

198
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,009

Apples.

201
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,277
Yes. Apple
- Not apple Hill.

202
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,478
Yes

203
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,023
The hill is 2 1/2
hours away from the canal.

204
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,624
Andthere an important project of..

205
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,355
..animal welfare trust
is going to be passed.

206
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,023
Should we collect animals' dung?

207
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,260
First let me finish.
- Tell us.

208
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,029
ln afew years' time whenthe
trust's project will be passed..

209
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,629
..that landwill cost billions.

210
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,039
'Now, let me see
who calls me pauper.'

211
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,046
'Alongwith all my three daughters
l will send-off Billo too.'

212
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,509
'Acting smart.'

213
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,681
'Now, nobody can stop me
from goingto America.'

214
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,251
'l will directly go to Hollywood.'

215
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,059
'And l will make agood actionfilm
with beautiful foreigner girls'

216
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,124
'Return of Blue Lagoon.'

217
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,729
'Enough of working.'

218
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,230
'l will throw the money on
the moneylenders' face'

219
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,336
'And l will open anice
shop of dry cleaning.'

220
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,070
'l will live peacefully.'

221
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,236
'Peacefully.'
-where are all three ofyou lost?

222
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,512
You have still not got the wealth.

223
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,078
And all three of you
are weaving dreams

224
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,716
Forget being rich.

225
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,345
Now, we will become very rich.

226
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,116
Not so easily, Chiksi.

227
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,086
why? We will inherit it, right?

228
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,217
Yes

229
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,098
But as perthe will all
three ofyouwill get the land..

230
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,223
..three years after his death.

231
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,098
Afterthree years.

232
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,265
Should we sit idle till then?

233
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,701
Why will you sit idle?

234
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,136
Your grandpa has made
arrangements forthat as well.

235
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,368
As perthe will, your
grandpa's inheritors..

236
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,774
..that is, all three of
you will get the land..

237
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,109
..when all three of
youwill perform.

238
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,116
..his death anniversary on that
hill forthe next three years.

239
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,378
what?

240
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,509
Yes

241
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,110
Youwill have to reach the
hill before 12 o'clock..

242
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,280
..onthe day ofthe
death anniversary.

243
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,849
And spend the whole day there.

244
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,418
Sounds like reality show.

245
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,719
Big Brother's Punjabi version.

246
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,188
Three brothers.

247
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,656
Shut up,

248
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:32,169
Not just that, if any ofyou don't
fulfill the condition of the will..

249
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,568
..then his land will be sold and..

250
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,402
..instead of you somebody
else will get the money.

251
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:37,866
That person's
identity is mentioned..

252
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,137
..in your grandpa's second will.

253
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:45,139
And his identity will remain a
secret forthree years and 30 days.

254
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,151
..fromthe date of his death.

255
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,377
lt's abit confusing.

256
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,511
Will you please explain it again?

257
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,884
Stop your nonsense.

258
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,817
l don't want to stay on a hill.

259
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,217
That too with
these two foolish boys.

260
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,351
Yes

261
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,823
l also don't want to
waste my two days.

262
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,292
l also don't want
to stay onthe hill.

263
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,166
Fine. As you wish.

264
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,228
But think about it.

265
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,462
Hill worth billions

266
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,631
British mansion.

267
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,909
And just two days in a year.

268
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,585
Find some other solution.

269
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,580
Think of a scheme

270
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,656
Your grandpa hatched a scheme

271
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,682
what do l do?

272
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,451
Anotherthing.

273
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,192
As perthe will all
three brothers will have to..

274
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,201
..keep your grandpa's
ashes with you for a year.

275
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,860
And each year you will
have to take it with you.

276
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,814
Look.

277
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,694
what place he has
selected as his home!

278
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,895
Light. Light.

279
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,466
You..

280
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,234
what amess!

281
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,377
Come on.

282
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,819
Oh, no.

283
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,818
To hell withthe light.

284
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,355
l don't have to see
beautiful faces.

285
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,042
Door.

286
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,377
where is the door?

287
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,667
Brother.

288
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,710
Brother.

289
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,415
Brother.

290
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,958
Brother. Brother.

291
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,363
Brother, are you alive?

292
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,561
l won't die before killing you.

293
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,537
why didn't you switch on the light?

294
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,637
Did Fancy come?

295
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,973
You started acting
smugly as soon as you came.

296
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,846
''Brother, are you alive?''

297
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,379
''Did Fancy come?''

298
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,845
''Why didn't you
switch on the light?''

299
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,376
Yes. Yes.

300
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,077
Break the door.

301
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,053
why are you moving so much?

302
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,487
l am searching forthe signal.

303
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,904
l don't know where Fancy is

304
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,169
He is Fancy.

305
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,869
He must be playing aruse somewhere.

306
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,854
who is it?

307
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,059
Fancy, you.

308
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,597
Fancy, you.

309
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,530
l am Fancy.

310
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,864
l am Fancy.

311
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,196
One more Fancy.

312
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,533
Come on.

313
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,076
Come on.

314
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,475
Fancy might forget
to bringthe ashes

315
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,479
Stop talking negatively.

316
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,022
Even a fool like Fancy can't
forget ashes worth billions

317
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,658
ln such a weather? On amotorcycle?

318
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,230
Afool like Fancy can do anything.

319
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,491
Shut up,

320
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,861
Don't increase my blood pressure.

321
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:36,967
Blood pressure has to increase.

322
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,499
l had never imagined that
my efforts of two years..

323
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,233
..will be wasted like this.

324
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,733
All my dreams will shatter.

325
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,501
what are you blabbering?

326
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:48,939
You rememberthe condition,
don't you?

327
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,112
We have to reach before 12 o'clock.

328
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,512
lf he doesn't come on time..

329
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,519
..we won't get the wealth.

330
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,645
Andfreedom

331
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,187
And your old age
won't be comfortable.

332
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,255
what's the time?

333
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,535
Now?
-No. when yourfather got married.

334
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,531
what'sthe time now?

335
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,195
This..

336
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,730
11:30.

337
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,539
Let him come.

338
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,772
Today, l will meet him lovingly.

339
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,079
l will shake hands.

340
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,550
l will hug him

341
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,747
l will give him a few kisses.

342
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,822
when he will relax and sit,
l will kick himfrom behind.

343
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,971
This is what Fancy deserves

344
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,644
Brother.

345
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:06,984
l think in ourentire family
you are the only sensible person.

346
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,116
Liar.

347
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,250
No. Really, brother.

348
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,590
That's why l respect you so much.

349
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,188
Get lost.

350
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,060
lt's very cold, right?

351
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,262
So?

352
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,601
Light the fire.

353
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,109
Brother, you know.

354
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,612
Last year too l
couldn't light the fire

355
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,206
l will make apegfor you.

356
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,612
You light it.

357
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,689
No. Really, brother.

358
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:48,923
lsthis done?

359
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,626
No care. No worry.

360
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,627
He. His bike. And his dog.

361
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,933
Don't talk about the dog.

362
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,700
Last year he gobbled my
entire bottle of digestive pills.

363
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,302
And he shitted all overthe house.
lt was reeking so badly.

364
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,304
Fool.

365
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,714
Wow!

366
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,928
Brother. Brother, do
something about the smoke.

367
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,055
lt's blowing inside

368
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,733
The house is so dirty.

369
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,669
Oh, no.

370
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,343

This ape will surely be

468
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,195
Set his tail ablaze

469
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,232

lt's our mother. Let me tell you.

478
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,209
Uncle, your mother

00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,750
l don't want to sell my land.

00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,605
He will buy my land.

491
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,738
Look, Chiksi.

492
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,882
Not just me, but the
entire village knows.

493
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,144
For Khetrapal Gill
everybody is equal.

494
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,850
He sees everyone equally.

495
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:31,846
He has only one eye.

496
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,685
So he is boundto
see everyone equally.

497
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:34,882
Pump the water.

498
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,286
So you have decided?

499
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:38,886
Yes

00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:39,697
l am not afraid of anyone.

501
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,163
l am not afraid of anyone.

502
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,562
Chiksi.

503
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,740
How dare you!

504
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:55,176
You soldthe land
without my permission.

505
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,371
You are not
willing to give me money.

506
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,180
l will have to do something, right?

507
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,920
You sold your motherfor 500,000.

508
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,311
Don't you feel ashamed?

509
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,255
l explained to you so many times..

510
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,758
..that there is nothing
inthe city.

511
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,254
lf not about yourself, at least
think about your small brothers.

512
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,195
Don't run away from
your responsibilities

513
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,326
Let me tell you

514
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,199
You can also take
care of them, grandpa.

515
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,935
l will go to the city
and open a shop of clothes

516
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,607
l will do some suitable job.

517
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,377
All my friends
have gone to the city.

518
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,481
And l am taking care of the
fields forthe past four years.

519
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,375
And l have become their mother.

520
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,941
You shouldn't follow suit blindly.

521
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,882
ls there any shortage
in the village? Tell me.

522
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,218
Yes. There is a shortage

523
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,758
lf there is no shortage,
we have not prospered too.

524
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,223
lnthis decrepit village.

525
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,352
Shameless.

526
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,286
You argue with me.

527
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,966
Go and cancel the deal.

528
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,534
l don't want to sell my land.

529
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,933
Grandpa, l have given my word.

530
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,496
As it is, l am selling
only my share ofthe land.

531
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,707
You are talking about share.

532
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,604
Listento me carefully.

533
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,247
You won't get a
single piece ofmy land.

534
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,619
Chiksi.

535
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,691
Since that day l
didn't enterthat house

536
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,728
Grandpa deliberated added
this clause inthe will.

537
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,632
So that after his death
we also fight and die.

538
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,600
And we don't get apenny.

539
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:29,864
That's why l am saying.

540
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,002
Have some mercy.

541
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,568
We have spent two years peacefully.

542
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,542
Let us spend this
yeartoo peacefully.

543
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,276
Fine. We will be
peaceful until Fancy comes.

544
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,346
Afterthat l will have to
vent out my anger on him

545
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,417
After all, he also has
a share inthe wealth.

546
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:52,555
Come. The door is open.

547
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,891
Come in.

548
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,297
Fancy.

549
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,732
Fancy.

550
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:07,668
Brother.

551
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,303
Brother, l think he
is not in his senses.

552
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,313
Fancy.

553
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,378
Did you recognize me?

554
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,584

01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:05,529
Don't worry. l never miss my aim.

1098
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:14,808
lt's my turn lt's my turn now.

1099
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:15,941
Don't you dare!

1100
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,484
No one will dare to touch my weapon.

1101
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,485
How did it fire automatically?

1102
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:25,159
Do you think any bird will
come in such a coldweather?

1103
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:26,885
The rest of the birds
must have also flown away..

1104
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,088
..on hearing the sound of fire.

1105
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,166
We shouldforget
about food for some time.

1106
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,168
Look there. The sky has cleared.

1107
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:35,965
The way will become cleartoo.

1108
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,100
Someone will definitely come.

1109
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,697
The snow has
fallenthe entire night.

1110
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,436
No one except we and
this invader must be crazy..

1111
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:43,978
..to come here in such cold.

1112
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:45,103
lt must be.
- No.

1113
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:46,442
There must be
someone who must know..

1114
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:49,177
..whetherwe are here ornot.

1115
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:51,777
l have forbidden you so
many times not to read..

1116
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:53,115
..the comics of Chacha Choudhary.

1117
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:54,450
Get aside!

1118

1120
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:00,927
..someone else too
can get the property.

1121
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:04,194
Will anyone let millions of rupees
slip out ofhis hands easily?

1122
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,539
He will definitely
keep a watch on us

1123
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:12,197
But who?

1124
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,541
lt is possible he is
some manfrom the court.

1125
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:15,735
You mean that Chadda.

1126
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:18,142
No, no, not Chadda.
Not Chadda, brother.

1127
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,475
lt is possible.

1128
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:21,475
lt is possible that the
man of the otherwill..

1129
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,609
..has appointed
someone else forthis work.

1130
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,815
Like like like one name

1131
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:29,483

..as much he is
serving this lnvader.

Andwhat about when you had tied
me like a victim onthe terrace?

1174
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,296
You shouldn't take such
a trifle thing seriously.

How can't l?

Someone makes aperson starve.

They triedto
tarnish our honour. l see.

Boys don't have any honour.
- l know.

And l will get promotion.

01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:22,503
l had high hopes for
the past three years.

1421
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:23,832
..but everything is ruined.

1422
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:26,507
Not just you alone but my dreams..

1423
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:27,836
..have been shattered as well.

1424
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:31,506
l have lost all hopes
along withthe property.

1425
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:32,837
We lost the property?

1426
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:35,181
why are you sayingthat, Happy?

1427
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:39,517
All my dreams will be over.
- Shut up.

1428
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,652
This has happened
because of yourfoolishness

1429
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:44,986
You are just as quarrelsome.

1430
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:47,522
lf you hadn't quarrelled
about that shortie being a spy.

1431
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:50,598
..then this chaos
would have never occurred,

1432
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:53,996
And this fool wouldn't have got
an opportunity to use his brains

1433
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,535
Why are you yelling at me?

1434
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,795
You two were enjoying
the stuffed-bread as well.

1435
01:27:57,905 --> 01:27:59,532
You should have given
us some poison as well..

1436
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:02,872
..then at least we
wouldn't have seen this day.

1437
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:06,944
l am sure to be defamed.

1438
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:09,545
You are concerned
only about your respect.

1439
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:11,949
what about my respect?
-what respect do you have?

1440
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:14,214
Auseless, fake doctor.

1441
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:16,757
And a wandering street-performer.

1442
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:20,819

with your drawstring shop either.

1445
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,624
And what respect are
you talking about?

1446
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:29,894
You left your respect back
at the village 20 years ago.

1447
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:32,234
l haven't heard any less
stories ofyour respect either.

1448
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:35,901
Youwere caught nude
with a girl. Brother!

1449
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:37,841
Bravo! Bravo!

1450
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:39,637
Now abuse me as well.

1451
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:42,907
Forsake whatever little
respect you have for me

1452
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:44,644
Have you done
anythingthat an elder does?

1453
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:47,186
You wouldn't have run away
ifyou really were an elder.

1454
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:50,257
Stop your nonsense.
-why? why?

1455
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:51,922
Grandpa was right.

1456
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,716
You ran away from
your responsibilities

1457
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,661
Responsibilities? You
two were burdens for me.

1458
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:57,788
Burdens.

1459
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:00,665
what else could l have done?

1460
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:03,669
Washed yourclothes all my life

1461
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,801
Great. Great, brother.

1462
01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:12,272
Now l know how selfish
you have always been.

1463
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,611
l thought about moving
ahead in life so l am selfish

1464
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:20,280
lf your grandpahad given
me some money at that time..

1465
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:21,685
..then l would have
been someone today.

1466
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:23,620
But no.

1467
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,086
He had to raise you two.

1468
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,761
You were a leach.

1469
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:30,287
And you.

1470
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:32,695
Father's last mistake

1471
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:34,094
You dropped in as well.

1472
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:37,228
You ruined my life.

1473
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:40,637
Yes. Yes, l ruined your life

1474
01:29:40,808 --> 01:29:41,832
And yours.

1475
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:43,308
l ruined your life
as well, isn't it?

1476
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:44,708
Yes, yes, you did it.

1477
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:46,237
Youtwo did.

1478
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:48,838
Don't hold me
responsible foryourweaknesses.

1479
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:49,974
Why shouldn't l?

1480
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:53,848
One brother left me to rot
andthe other.. - Otherwhat?

1481
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,247
How did l ruin you?
- ln everyway.

1482
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:58,051
You ruined everything.

1483
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:01,651
lf l ruined everything. Happy,
then you could've rectified it.

1484
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:05,257
why didn't you look for her?
- Don't change the topic.

1485
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:06,663
This isthe topic, Happy.

1486
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:07,860
You didn't look for her.

1487
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:09,802
Because you didn't have the courage

1488
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:11,861
And every time you simply cursed me.

1489
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:12,997
Yes l did.
-why?

1490
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:14,131
Yes l did.
-why?

1491
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:16,799
Because.. l hate you.

1492
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:18,675
And youtoo.

1493
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:21,681
Not as much as l hate you two.

1494
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,847
So, what have youthought?

1495
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:05,179
Will you admit your crimes?

1496
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:08,254
Why are you crocking like
a rooster in the morning?

1497
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:11,788
l said we didn't commit any crime

1498
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:18,260
All three brothers
are in a comic mood.

1499
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:25,802
l am asking forthe last time..

1500
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:28,206
..do you admit your crimes or not?

1501
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:29,936
Why are you repeating..

1502
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:43,482
what.. No, no.

1503
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:46,492
Not that.
- Do you admit your crime or not?

1504
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:47,822
No, not that.

1505
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:56,833
Do you admit or not?

1506
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,501
Gabru!

1507
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:05,243
lf youtouch brother again..

1508
01:33:07,348 --> 01:33:08,906
Such brotherhood.

1509
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,844
lf he doesn't then
you will admit it?

1510
01:33:20,227 --> 01:33:22,388
l will teach all of you.

1511
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:30,935
There isn't a single criminal..

1512
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:37,867
..who didn't admit
defeat before Gabru Bawra.

1513
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:08,375
Kick them, punchthem,
make their plight bad.

1514
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:12,310
Make mincemeat out
of these apestoday.

1515
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:23,122
Monster, bow before me.

1516
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:25,257
Ravan is my name

1517
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:30,258
Let's beginthe ultimate
battle in this battlefield.

1518
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:44,408
My left eye flutters.

1519
01:34:45,112 --> 01:34:48,946
Let's return Sita and
be friends with Ravan

1520
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:53,013
l have a solution for yourflutter.

1521
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:12,435
My ten heads cannot be
razed by any bow and arrow.

1522
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:27,311
what is it? Free me.

1523
01:35:27,421 --> 01:35:28,445

1525
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:49,075
My ten heads cannot be
razed by any bow and arrow.

1526
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:51,076
Fly away.

1527
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:56,410
Fly away from here
you dirty, black ape.

1528
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:16,036
Hold this monkey's rope tightly.

1529
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:32,052
'Hold this monkey's rope tightly.'

1530
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:37,179
Hold this monkey's rope tightly.

1531
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:44,060
We don't want to
entertain him in Lanka.

1532
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:52,068
We don't want to
entertain him in Lanka.

1533
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:01,140

We should be heading
that way and not this

1538
01:37:23,404 --> 01:37:25,304
Brother, the city is downwards

1539
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:26,703
You are taking us on
the wrong side

1540
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:28,434
No, l am taking you
to the right side.

1541
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:31,236
We should be heading towards
the hill and not the city.

1542
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:34,307
Brother. Brother,
forget about the property.

1543
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:36,576
We might land in jail
again forthat property.

1544
01:37:36,884 --> 01:37:38,112
Yes, brother.

1545
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:40,312

what should l do with them?

1553
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:23,624
They digtheir own grace

1554
01:38:24,865 --> 01:38:26,298
Crazy.

1555
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:33,173
''Once a situation arose where''

1556
01:38:34,808 --> 01:38:39,177

01:39:21,255 --> 01:39:22,415
where is the sound coming from?

1566
01:39:22,923 --> 01:39:24,288
Terminators.

The mountain police

They reached before us

1587
01:41:08,028 --> 01:41:10,462
