(SIGHS)

190
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:35,999
Why are you coming running so happily?

191
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,464
Don't you know?
My sister is getting married tomorrow.

192
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:43,197
You are happy. But I am sad.

193
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:44,698
What?! Sad?

194
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,671
I am her uncle. When I am there...

195
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,556
Sit.

196
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,884
I am not the groom then. Right?

197
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:57,560
That's all. Okay...(MOTORBIKE STARTS)

198
00:18:02,308 --> 00:18:03,828
- Tara!
- Yes, Father.

199
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:07,436
How dare you?
Whatever you are doing, is not proper.

200
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,970
What mistake did I do?

201
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,274
Did you go and talk to
the boy whom your sister loves?

202
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:14,358
Yes, father.

203
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:15,697
Yes?

204
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:19,296
With great difficulty I have
fixed my sister's son as groom.

205
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:23,522
You may fix a groom
with great difficulty.

206
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,975
But my sister should
also like that groom.

207
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:27,708
Did you sister tell you to convey this?

208
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:30,333
- No.
- Then why did you go and see that boy?

209
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:32,370
Because I want my sister to be happy.

210
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,701
I want her to be happy.
That is why I am talking now.

211
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,431
If you want her to be happy,
get her married to that groom.

212
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:41,614
It is not kid's talk.
It is your sister's life.

213
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:43,641
As her father, don't I know what to do?

214
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:45,962
Do not start a fight
between father and daughter.

215
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,060
What is your final decision?

216
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,715
Final word?
My decision remains the same.

217
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:53,512
I will never allow love marriage.

218
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,816
Okay. You accept your decision
and I will take my decision.

219
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:02,593
Hey! You have brought the snacks meant
for a bandicoot. What will that do?!

220
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:06,076
This was given by the couple
whom we got married yesterday.

221
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:07,601
Is it?!

222
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:09,814
What happened?

223
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:10,895
- Buddy!
- What?

224
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,247
- Look at that person.
- Yes.

225
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:15,343
If we have to drive a car in our village,
it can be done only through him.

226
00:19:15,423 --> 00:19:16,971
Why? Is he working in an RTO?

227
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:22,168
- No.
- He seems to be a useless person.

228
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:24,861
He is the only person who
has seen the devil in our village.

229
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:27,154
That is why I am saying that
we should use him to pass time.

230
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:29,115
Hey! Come here.

231
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:31,441
Steady yourself.

232
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:32,683
- Did you call me?
- Yes.

233
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:34,751
Now I will ask you a question.
And you will answer.

234
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:35,869
Okay.

235
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:37,438
Did you see?

236
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,682
- Yes, I saw.
- When did you see?

237
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,088
- I saw when I went.
- What did it say?

238
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:46,286
It said that it likes me.
Even I said that I like it.

239
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:49,647
Did you say that you like it?! How?

240
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:53,033
Yes. The girl was beautiful.

241
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:54,499
Mother-in-law also agreed
to get her married to me

242
00:19:54,523 --> 00:19:55,832
and allow me to stay with them.

243
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:57,496
So I said that I like her.

244
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:59,870
Devil's mother-in-law!
What is he saying?!

245
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,282
Were you not talking
about devil all the time?

246
00:20:02,362 --> 00:20:04,903
Were you not asking
about my wife all the time?

247
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:07,005
No one will ask about wife.

248
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:10,086
Is your wife God's offering
that any stranger will ask about her?

249
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,461
You Rascal!

250
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:14,087
You all belong to this village.

251
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:18,090
Everyone in this village except me,
ask for my wife.

252
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:21,563
You say we can pass
time by talking to him.

253
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,757
Now he is passing time with our help.

254
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:25,347
Do not get angry. I will ask now.

255
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:27,203
About devil or about wife?

256
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,336
I am asking about devil.

257
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,846
Did you see?

258
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:32,749
- Yes, I saw.
- Will you say?

259
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:35,032
- No. I will not tell.
- You said just now that you saw.

260
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:37,776
Why will I tell for free?
You have to give something.

261
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:41,149
He wants liquor.

262
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,147
Okay.

263
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:46,552
- Will you say if we get you a quarter?
- I will tell just one person. Is it okay?

264
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:48,267
I will get full bottle. Will you tell?

265
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,507
- I will tell the whole village.
- That's good. -Super!

266
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:56,536
Take. Spread a hoax by telling about
the devil to everyone in the village.

267
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,017
- Everyone should scream.
- Which way should I go?

268
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,220
Dear! Did you speak to your sister?

269
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,250
- Regarding what?
- Regarding our daughter's marriage.

270
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,818
- Will I not talk about it?
- What did she say?

271
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:11,957
Her son is coming from
Singapore next month.

272
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:15,251
She asked me to ask about
their opinion directly.

273
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:17,948
She said she is ready if they agree.

274
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,843
I feel very happy.

275
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:23,187
I will be happy if
this marriage takes place.

276
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:26,462
Do not worry. This marriage will happen.

277
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:28,659
Whose marriage are you talking about?

278
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:32,219
Not about your marriage.
It is about your sister's marriage.

279
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,507
(LAUGHS)

280
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:40,821
Mother! Come in for a minute.

281
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:43,351
- Come in.
- What is it?

282
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:49,448
Why don't you understand her feelings?

283
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:52,927
Rascal! I will slap you.
We know. You do your work.

284
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,930
What is that noise?

285
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:56,365
Nothing...

286
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:07,876
You look handsome in your youth.
How did you marry mother?

287
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:11,816
She was not attracted to me.
She was attracted to my moustache.

288
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:16,024
What?! After seeing me,
he was attracted to my beauty.

289
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:18,452
Then he was adamant
that he will marry only me

290
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:21,205
and was standing in front of my house.

291
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:23,125
- Have you forgotten that?
- I did not see you.

292
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,190
- I saw your younger sister.
- What are you saying?!

293
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:27,247
Mother! You seem to be very cheerful.

294
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:29,717
Why are you laughing?

295
00:22:29,797 --> 00:22:31,443
I thought about your
marriage and laughed.

296
00:22:31,523 --> 00:22:33,323
- I will hit on your head.
- He is hitting me!

297
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,189
I will kill you. Sit down.

298
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:38,433
- You can't sleep if you don't scold him.
- Mother!

299
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:40,696
Come, My dear son.

300
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,277
This is mother's marriage album.

301
00:22:42,357 --> 00:22:45,794
She has to go and live in another house.
So I am showing to her.

302
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:49,808
I am teaching her how to
behave in her in-law's house.

303
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:54,489
Your hair is wet.
Dry it and change your dress.

304
00:22:55,148 --> 00:22:58,695
You see.
I will prepare coffee and bring.

305
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:02,192
Hope you have no problem.

306
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,320
I am fine.

307
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,445
Father, Bye.

308
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,654
- Are you going far?
- Yes.

309
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:13,816
Malar! Your father is
respected in this village.

310
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:19,036
Our family teaches the values
of honor to other families.

311
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:21,478
You belong to this family.

312
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:23,951
But you go out and speak to a boy.

313
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:25,117
Is it proper?

314
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:28,411
I do not want to be a burden to anybody.
Please do not disturb me.

315
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:32,140
What are you talking?
Who is disturbing whom?

316
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,800
I and your father wish
that you should be happy

317
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,981
and lead a happy life till the end.

318
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:41,039
Do you consider this
as disturbance for you?

319
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:45,783
I am in such a situation that whatever
anyone speaks, I feel irritated.

320
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:46,968
Bye.

321
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,066
- Vishnu!
- Tell me.

322
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:02,320
Do you know my dreams
about the life we should live?

323
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,505
Even me.

324
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:05,370
- How?
- Like this.

325
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:06,780
Go!

326
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:11,593
According to my father's wish...

327
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:15,130
According to my mother's wish...

328
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,421
Do not talk nonsense.

329
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,633
My life is with you.

330
00:24:20,713 --> 00:24:25,336
I believe you. That is why
I have left my parents and come to you.

331
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:28,073
- You believe me. Isn't it?
- Yes.

332
00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:30,495
- Then promise me.
- I promise I believe you.

333
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:32,745
I am not bothered about how you do it.

334
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:34,458
But we both are getting
married tomorrow.

335
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:35,755
What are you saying?!

336
00:24:35,835 --> 00:24:38,796
My family has started seeing a girl
for me. That is why I am telling you.

337
00:24:40,205 --> 00:24:43,235
Look! You are coming tomorrow. Bye.

338
00:24:46,924 --> 00:24:49,498
Marriage! Marriage!

339
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:53,046
Marriage! Marriage!

340
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:54,900
Why is he so anxious?

341
00:24:55,955 --> 00:25:00,485
I am so excited.
Can't you ask the reason for that?

342
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,691
Tell.

343
00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:03,557
I had been to the temple yesterday.

344
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,938
You are boasting as
if you had been to a fort.

345
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:08,532
- Will you listen to me?
- Tell.

346
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,857
I met a couple there who are in love.

347
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:14,031
You must have become
emotional immediately.

348
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:16,904
That you should also get

- Tell me the matter.

That girl came to me and cried.

351
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:26,198
Why? Did you love and
then deceive that girl?

- No.
- Yes. He is not fit for that.

00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,455
You are more worried than
me that I am still unmarried.

354
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:35,117
You will remain unmarried till the end.

Tell me what happened.

356
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:42,242
That girl came to me. She said she loves
someone but her parents object to it.

357
00:25:42,455 --> 00:25:47,837
She pleaded with me to
help me unite with her lover.

358
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:50,573
- What did you reply?
- I told her, 'Don't worry.

- Will punch your face.

to go for painter job.

But I refused saying
I cannot hold a brush.

to go for mechanic job.

I cannot hold a spanner.

Then why should we
bear all the thrashes.

369

Rs.5000 if we unite them.

371

Are you not ashamed to behave
in such a disgusting manner?

No. We will not get
money if we feel ashamed.

- Sing softly. Otherwise I will kill you.

Sir, Come. Greetings!

568
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:29,749
Please sit.

569
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:33,682
- Are you Mutharasan?
- Yes, Sir.

570
00:41:34,026 --> 00:41:37,290
You have given complaint that your
daughter died on the day of marriage.

571
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:40,189
- Yes, Sir.
- Who all attended the marriage?

572
00:41:40,857 --> 00:41:43,158
Do you have enemies amongst the guests?

573
00:41:43,238 --> 00:41:44,860
No such enemies.

574
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:49,087
Do you remember the time your
daughter left the marriage hall?

575
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,881
She did not go from the marriage hall.

576
00:41:51,691 --> 00:41:53,511
As per our family custom,

577
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:56,404
the bride and groom are
sent to our Family deity's temple.

578
00:41:56,577 --> 00:41:59,566
They went to pray to God.
But did not return back.

(CRYING)

580
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:04,665
They left but did not come back.

581
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:06,884
Do not feel for anything.
We are there to help you.

582
00:42:06,964 --> 00:42:08,040
Okay Sir.

583
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,601
Hey! Hey!

584
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:19,415
What happened? Why are you tensed?
Sit down. What happened?

585
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,835
That Policeman has
come here in search of us.

586
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,748
But there is no Police
station in our village.

587
00:42:23,828 --> 00:42:26,092
- Is that so important!
- Where is he now?

588
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:28,943
He is going to all the
places where the murder happened.

589
00:42:29,023 --> 00:42:31,432
But we did not commit any murder.

590
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:33,084
But they will suspect us.

591
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:34,756
What shall we do now?

592
00:42:34,836 --> 00:42:37,042
Let us leave this place
and go away somewhere for a week.

593
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:38,587
Okay. That is right. Come.

594
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:39,739
Where are you going now?

595
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:41,587
I will go to my Company
and give leave letter.

596
00:42:41,611 --> 00:42:43,193
- We are the Company.
- Yes.

597
00:42:43,273 --> 00:42:44,571
Come. Let us run.

598
00:42:44,992 --> 00:42:46,703
(INDISTINCT VOICE ON CORDLESS)

599
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:48,795
Brother! Come here.

600
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:51,163
Why are you going this side?

601
00:42:51,243 --> 00:42:52,915
I am going in search of some clue.

602
00:42:52,995 --> 00:42:56,272
This is a very dangerous place. You should
not go there without our permission.

603
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:57,587
Understand?

604
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:58,883
Come here.

605
00:42:59,823 --> 00:43:01,477
I can understand your position.

606
00:43:01,754 --> 00:43:04,462
- You know about this place. Isn't it?
- I know.

607
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:06,384
I am saying for your good.

608
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,869
Even those Policemen
who have done encounters

609
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:10,422
are scared to come to this place.

610
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,348
Even if they come, they go back soon.

611
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,957
I have told Sir about your sister.

612
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:18,548
- Do not worry.
- Thanks a lot.

613
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:20,121
I will meet Sir and go.

614
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,219
(SPIT)

615
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:33,377
Hey! Have you finished?

616
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,299
- No.
- We will finish.

617
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,906
I haven't started yet.

618
00:43:36,986 --> 00:43:40,084
Why is he irritating us?
Turn back.

619
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,914
Did you tell everyone
about having seen the devil?

620
00:43:45,994 --> 00:43:47,025
I said...

621
00:43:47,105 --> 00:43:48,679
- He has told. Come. Let us go.
- Wait.

622
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:52,173
We cannot believe him and go from here.
Did you say or not?

623
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,389
I have told.

624
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:55,546
Looks like he would not have told.

625
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:57,460
- I will ask him properly.
- Ask.

626
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,927
Say correctly. Did you say?

627
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:00,929
- Yes, I said.
- Why didn't you say afterwards?

628
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:03,232
- I didn't see.
- You have already seen.

629
00:44:03,312 --> 00:44:05,818
- But I have told on that day.
- Why didn't you say afterwards?

630
00:44:05,898 --> 00:44:08,584
- I didn't see afterwards.
- Will you not tell if you see once?

631
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:10,408
I will tell only if I see every time.

632
00:44:10,488 --> 00:44:12,044
You said you will say if you see once.

633
00:44:12,124 --> 00:44:14,667
Then Why are the Police coming
in search of us? We are scared.

634
00:44:14,747 --> 00:44:17,074
- Are you scared of Police?!
- Yes.

635
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,139
Then do you sell liquor?

636
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:23,168
We are not selling liquor.
It is a social service.

637
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:24,993
Oh! Are you selling Samosas?

638
00:44:25,073 --> 00:44:26,976
We mean Social work.

639
00:44:27,056 --> 00:44:29,262
- Oh! Foreign liquor!
- Goddamn it!

640
00:44:29,342 --> 00:44:31,273
Have you broken it?
Don't you have intellect?

641
00:44:31,353 --> 00:44:35,772
Whether foreign or country liquor...
Should you not hold the bottle lightly?

642
00:44:35,852 --> 00:44:39,106
See this bottle. It has been 3 years
since I bought it. It is a lucky bottle.

643
00:44:39,186 --> 00:44:42,219
Whichever liquor I buy,
I pour in this and drink.

644
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:43,899
We have to hold the
bottle tightly... Ah!

645
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,856
Move. Let us discuss.

646
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:51,535
He is talking nonsense
and is trying to fool us.

647
00:44:51,615 --> 00:44:54,099
Shall I correct him?

648
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:57,991
No. You will confuse him. I will speak.

649
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:03,281
He is not here.
Even the liquor bottles are not there.

650
00:45:03,899 --> 00:45:07,669
Every time he takes liquor
from us and then escapes.

651
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:10,872
We should not spare him.
He is going there. Hey!

652
00:45:10,952 --> 00:45:11,977
Rascal!

653
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:13,762
- Mr. Parandaman!
- Sir.

654
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:15,768
What is the position of the case?

655
00:45:15,848 --> 00:45:18,121
- Did you get details about the murderer?
- Sir! That...

656
00:45:18,201 --> 00:45:21,111
Higher ups are questioning
and torturing me.

657
00:45:21,191 --> 00:45:23,007
- Sir!
- Contact me if you need any help.

658
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,252
- Sir!
- Okay Sir.

659
00:45:24,844 --> 00:45:26,648
What happened?
Why are you running towards us?

660
00:45:26,728 --> 00:45:31,493
This is not the work of devil,
which the people here say.

661
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:34,625
- Who else?
- A human being is doing all this.

662
00:45:34,705 --> 00:45:39,875
We know that. We are struggling
hard to find out who he is.

663
00:45:39,955 --> 00:45:42,953
I would have caught him yesterday.
But he escaped.

664
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:46,398
I will surely catch
him within a couple of days.

665
00:45:46,478 --> 00:45:48,539
Go home without fear.

666
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:50,591
Tell me if you get any clue.

667
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:52,720
It will be useful
to catch him red handed.

668
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,645
Thank you, Sir. See you.

669
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,838
- Mom I am going out.
- One minute...

670
00:45:59,536 --> 00:46:01,198
Can I know where Madam is going?

671
00:46:01,278 --> 00:46:03,133
Gnyani is going to find out the murderer.

672
00:46:03,213 --> 00:46:04,512
I will go along with him.

673
00:46:04,592 --> 00:46:07,606
He is going for picnic.
Why are you going along with him?

674
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:09,006
He is going to a forest mountain.

675
00:46:09,063 --> 00:46:10,661
What will we do if some
untoward incident happens there?

676
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:14,221
- Mind your business.
- Mother is right.

677
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,126
Why are you taking unnecessary risk?

678
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,372
You need not go. Stay here.

679
00:46:18,452 --> 00:46:21,104
I have to go to market.
I will come back soon. Give the bag.

680
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:24,680
She wants to go for a picnic!

681
00:46:28,004 --> 00:46:31,806
Let anybody tell anything.
I have to find out my sister's murderer.

682
00:46:31,886 --> 00:46:34,157
I don't care if I lose my life
because of that.

683
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:38,490
- Buddy! I can't.
- Leave my hand.

684
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,541
How far should we go?

685
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:03,706
You are always cheerful.
Why are you keeping mum now?

686
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:06,149
What do you want us to talk?

687
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:09,847
- Gnyani is missing.
- What?! Rani is missing!

688
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,671
- Dumb fellow! (SLAP)
- What happened?

689
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:16,160
- He says Gnyani is missing.
- Oh Gnyani! Okay. Tell.

690
00:47:16,505 --> 00:47:18,046
Tell.

691
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:22,667
Gnyani, who went in search
of the missing persons, is missing.

692
00:47:22,747 --> 00:47:24,552
Just now you said that Gnyani is missing.

693
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:26,802
Then how can he go in
search of missing persons?

694
00:47:27,218 --> 00:47:29,083
I am serious.
Why are you making it a joke?

695
00:47:29,163 --> 00:47:31,403
Okay... Tell. Do not get tensed.

696
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:35,025
Keep quiet.
Otherwise I will punch your face.

697
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:38,284
You say.

698
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:41,162
Gnyani is missing.

699
00:47:41,242 --> 00:47:44,510
Is he missing or is he dead?

700
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,038
- No... Gnyani is missing.
- Okay.

701
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:50,487
His lover is also missing.

702
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,449
- Tara is also missing?!
- Yes.

703
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:57,225
Is she also dead?
Or has she gone missing?

704
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:02,074
Situation is serious.

705
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,922
If we stay away from our village now,
we will be caught.

706
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:09,290
Let us do one thing.
Let us join the village people.

707
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,436
- Okay.
- Only then nobody will suspect us.

708
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:15,217
- What do you say?
- What about marriage?

709
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:18,436
All the marriages which we
performed have ended up in death.

710
00:48:18,516 --> 00:48:23,057
I do not mean that. What will happen to
our project where we united the lovers?

711
00:48:23,137 --> 00:48:24,371
- That?!
- Yes.

712
00:48:24,524 --> 00:48:26,560
Police will come now. We will ask them.

713
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,006
- Police! Let us escape.
- Run! Rascals!

714
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:35,868
We have to search and
find out the murderer?

715
00:48:35,948 --> 00:48:38,608
- It is our duty.
- Come here.

716
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:42,352
Who are you?

717
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,881
Where are you going?

718
00:48:45,961 --> 00:48:49,497
Gnyani and Tara have entered the forest.

719
00:48:49,577 --> 00:48:52,789
Their parents have
sent me to look for them.

720
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:54,703
- When did they go?
- I do not know.

721
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,808
- We will take care of that. You go.
- Okay, Sir.

722
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,211
Do not go towards this side.

723
00:49:24,036 --> 00:49:27,909
Buddy! How many more days
should we search like this?

724
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:32,884
I had no possession.
I had only my sister for me.

725
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,309
I do not want to take revenge on him.

726
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,819
But I want to know
the reason for his action.

727
00:49:38,988 --> 00:49:43,461
Are you mad? Nowadays,
murderers do not live in forest.

728
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,782
They live a comfortable life.

729
00:49:45,862 --> 00:49:47,890
On what basis are you
searching in the forest?

730
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,533
- I have belief.
- How?

731
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:52,020
I will tell you.

732
00:50:03,749 --> 00:50:07,398
Uncle, You search that side.
I will search this side.

733
00:50:07,478 --> 00:50:09,020
- Is it?!
- Yes. Go.

- Gnyani is dead.

in spite of warning you.

Sir! Even you warned him.
But he did not listen.

753

You said you will take care of him.
But now he is dead.

again in this village.

for the people's gossip.

he will call us back till evening.

Look there.
He is wearing cooling glass and rocking.

882
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:37,771
Even he is getting married.
But I am not getting married.

883
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:39,660
There is a fault in your horoscope.

884
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,271
Whatever it is. Come. Let us ask him.

885
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:43,966
- Greetings Sir!
- Greetings.

886
01:03:44,046 --> 01:03:46,991
Looks like you have performed
your son's marriage.

887
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:48,200
Yes.

888
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,594
We are there.

889
01:03:49,674 --> 01:03:52,716
You also tell your parents
and get married. Who is stopping you?

890
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:56,511
No, Sir. You could have invited us.

891
01:03:56,591 --> 01:03:58,180
I can invite you only if you stay here.

892
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,531
But you are always roaming.
Then how can I invite you.

893
01:04:00,611 --> 01:04:03,703
Never mind. The marriage is over.

894
01:04:03,783 --> 01:04:05,670
Where are the bride and the groom?

895
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,636
- They have gone for honeymoon.
- Honeymoon!

896
01:04:07,716 --> 01:04:11,974
How many days over since
they went for honeymoon?

897
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:13,880
- Two days.
- Did they call you?

898
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,674
They haven't called till now.

899
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:18,208
That's all!

900
01:04:18,471 --> 01:04:20,508
Very soon you will get some good news.

901
01:04:20,588 --> 01:04:22,996
- You may go.
- What?! They are blabbering something.

902
01:04:23,205 --> 01:04:25,536
This is also included
in our case history.

903
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:27,435
Yes. I am extremely tensed.

904
01:04:27,515 --> 01:04:28,560
Come. Let us go.

01:04:42,329 --> 01:04:43,403

914
01:05:40,682 --> 01:05:41,924

01:05:49,789 --> 01:05:51,111
Wait here.

916
01:05:52,837 --> 01:05:54,110
Come soon.

01:06:14,122 --> 01:06:15,480
Where have you gone?

919
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,379
We came so far so that
we can live together.

920
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:20,477
I will not leave.

921
01:06:21,124 --> 01:06:22,883
I will definitely save you.

Divya!

925
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:39,116
We dreamt of living a wonderful life.

926
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,392
But you have left me alone.
Divya!

927
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:42,608
Divya!

928
01:06:51,252 --> 01:06:55,002
I am Dharma! I am Yama!

929
01:07:02,331 --> 01:07:03,466
Please come, Sir.

930
01:07:04,077 --> 01:07:05,966
What is the matter? Sit down.

931
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:14,957
Tell me.

932
01:07:15,792 --> 01:07:19,587
Murders are taking
place continuously here.

933
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:21,978
Married couples are being murdered.

934
01:07:22,058 --> 01:07:24,240
Even I am unable to understand that.

935
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,176
Are there any enemies to
these people who were murdered?

936
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:31,343
I don't think there are enemies.

937
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:34,488
But they were in love.

938
01:07:35,015 --> 01:07:38,380
So I doubt that it
may be because of that.

939
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:44,110
Even if you get a single clue which
is doubtful, message me immediately.

940
01:07:44,256 --> 01:07:45,659
I will surely inform you.

941
01:07:45,739 --> 01:07:48,399
- Okay. See you then.
- Bye.

943
01:07:53,226 --> 01:07:54,418
Are you Parthasarathy?

944
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:56,428
Yes Sir. Sit down.

945
01:08:00,936 --> 01:08:03,523
Have you come to enquire
about the death of my son?

946
01:08:03,603 --> 01:08:04,667
Yes.

947
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:09,409
You may enquire.
I am not worried that my son is dead.

948
01:08:09,759 --> 01:08:11,891
(SOBS)

949
01:08:12,096 --> 01:08:14,843
I don't know the reason how he died.

950
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:16,255
I do not know the reason.

951
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:19,493
Our family was like a temple.

952
01:08:20,075 --> 01:08:23,065
But such a thing has
happened in our family.

953
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:27,478
Love marriage! Love marriage!

954
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:30,417
Why are such things happening?

955
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:33,914
Those who have love marriage...
Should they die like this?

956
01:08:34,187 --> 01:08:36,133
You should only find out.

957
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:41,059
I can understand your anger.

958
01:08:41,139 --> 01:08:43,558
From now on nobody
will die like your son.

959
01:08:43,781 --> 01:08:44,901
We will not allow it to happen.

960
01:08:44,925 --> 01:08:49,545
I am at a loss.
I do not know what to answer you.

961
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:54,618
Very soon we will find out
the reason for your son's death.

962
01:08:55,306 --> 01:08:56,779
- Bye.
- Okay, Sir.

963
01:08:58,563 --> 01:08:59,621
Come.

(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

965
01:09:07,204 --> 01:09:08,437
Please come. Sit down.

(FOOTFALLS)

967
01:09:12,393 --> 01:09:13,739
Tell me. What is the matter?

968
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:16,536
All those couples who have a love
marriage are dying. Do you know that?

969
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,974
- I heard about it.
- Where is your son?

970
01:09:20,054 --> 01:09:21,815
He has gone to my brother's house.

971
01:09:21,984 --> 01:09:24,571
Does your son love anyone?
Tell me.

972
01:09:24,651 --> 01:09:28,349
People gossip about it.

973
01:09:28,429 --> 01:09:31,147
They say he roams around with a girl.

974
01:09:31,227 --> 01:09:34,187
Do you know anything about
the girl with whom he was roaming?

975
01:09:34,267 --> 01:09:35,277
Girl?

976
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:51,084
Sorry. Are you hurt? I am sorry.

977
01:09:51,164 --> 01:09:52,991
- Do not come near me. You go away.
- I dashed by mistake. I am sorry.

978
01:09:53,015 --> 01:09:55,407
- I will hit you.
- Okay. I will not come near you.

979
01:09:55,487 --> 01:09:56,616
Where is your house?

980
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:58,772
There! You go.

981
01:09:59,081 --> 01:10:01,391
Okay. I will go. You go carefully.

982
01:10:02,972 --> 01:10:04,035
Take care.

983
01:10:05,024 --> 01:10:06,030
I am sorry.

984
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:11,900
I am sorry.

985
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:13,172
Go.

986
01:10:19,743 --> 01:10:22,287
- Couldn't you have come carefully?
- Why?

987
01:10:22,367 --> 01:10:26,354
He is the landlord's son.

988
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,662
He is a big man!

989
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:32,127
Everybody in this village
is scared of his father.

990
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:33,905
I dashed by mistake.

991
01:10:33,985 --> 01:10:36,571
It's okay. Go carefully.

01:10:41,639 --> 01:10:43,590

993
01:10:57,581 --> 01:10:59,900
Hit you! Throw.

01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:05,861
See and play.

995
01:11:05,941 --> 01:11:07,377
Hit that black coin.

996
01:11:07,742 --> 01:11:09,477
He doesn't know to play.

997

01:11:13,928 --> 01:11:16,182
- I am calling you. Come here.
- Landlord has come.

999
01:11:16,262 --> 01:11:18,095
- Bye!
- Why are you staring?

1000
01:11:19,546 --> 01:11:20,778
Come here. Come.

1001
01:11:21,137 --> 01:11:23,439
I am calling you.
Why are you still standing there? Come.

1002
01:11:26,979 --> 01:11:27,993
Father!

1003
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:31,019
What are you doing here?

1004
01:11:31,194 --> 01:11:33,451
Why are you always playing
with small children?

1005
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:36,876
Will anyone respect you?
I have told you many times.

1006
01:11:36,956 --> 01:11:40,535
I would have been happy if your
brain had also developed like your body.

1007
01:11:41,963 --> 01:11:45,809
You are of marriageable age. Still
you are playing with small children.

1008
01:11:45,972 --> 01:11:49,351
Henceforth I will not play.

1009
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:50,824
Go home.

1010
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:06,026
I am going to get what I wanted.

1011
01:12:06,228 --> 01:12:08,255
I wanted to lead a luxurious life.

1012
01:12:08,335 --> 01:12:10,515
My wishes are going to be fulfilled now.

1013
01:12:10,595 --> 01:12:11,620
(CHUCKLES)

1014
01:12:22,403 --> 01:12:24,643
Where shall I search him now?

1015
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:27,360
Where will he be?

1016
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:29,427
What will he be doing?

1017
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:32,600
How shall I tempt him?

1018
01:12:33,785 --> 01:12:39,045
He looks different.
Then how shall I trap him?

1019
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,151
Somehow I have to lure him.
Only then my wishes will be fulfilled.

1020
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:45,502
I should not spare him.

1021
01:12:45,684 --> 01:12:47,955
He is the richest
person in this village.

1022
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:51,776
If I let him go,
my wishes will never be fulfilled.

1023
01:12:51,938 --> 01:12:57,776
So I have to lure him
and get married to him.

1024
01:12:59,367 --> 01:13:02,317
This is a daily problem.

1025
01:13:02,397 --> 01:13:04,635
- What rubbish are you talking?
- Who is that?

1026
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:08,235
As if he is employed as
Accountant in All India Bank!

1027
01:13:08,315 --> 01:13:10,100
He is advising us.

1028
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:13,454
You fool! Three toilets
have been built for our village.

1029
01:13:13,534 --> 01:13:14,802
He is going to clean them.

1030
01:13:14,882 --> 01:13:16,586
Crap!(SPIT)

1031
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:19,521
He is cleaning. Why are you feeling bad?

1032
01:13:19,668 --> 01:13:20,973
Leave that...

1033
01:13:21,053 --> 01:13:24,265
You are saying as if I have
washed toilets with him for 3 years.

1034
01:13:24,683 --> 01:13:26,162
Ask whatever you want to ask.

1035
01:13:26,242 --> 01:13:28,002
Yesterday you said
you will show us something

1036
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,628
and took us to the festival. Isn't it?

1037
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:30,816
Come to that point.

1038
01:13:30,896 --> 01:13:32,963
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.

1039
01:13:33,043 --> 01:13:36,864
That girl Sona loves someone.

1040
01:13:38,202 --> 01:13:40,773
What?! Sona loves you?

1041
01:13:40,853 --> 01:13:42,556
- Not me.
- Now are you right.

1042
01:13:42,888 --> 01:13:45,061
Then who does she love?

1043
01:13:45,263 --> 01:13:48,976
She loves Mutharasan's son.

1044
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:52,422
You know she loves Mutharasan's son.

1045
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:54,732
Still you roam after her.
Isn't it wrong?

1046
01:13:54,812 --> 01:13:56,435
- Isn't it betrayal?
- Is it not a sin?

1047
01:13:56,825 --> 01:13:59,106
Have you finished talking?
Shut up for some time. -Okay.

1048
01:13:59,428 --> 01:14:02,866
Sona loves Mutharasan's son.

1049
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:05,379
We have to inform this to Mutharasan.

1050
01:14:05,459 --> 01:14:07,439
What will we gain by this?

1051
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:09,118
He will take care of us.

1052
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:11,518
Yes. He will take us to the
grove and take good care of us!

1053
01:14:11,598 --> 01:14:16,131
I do not mean that type of care. He
will take care of us by giving amount.

1054
01:14:16,366 --> 01:14:18,863
I do not mean that type of care.

1055
01:14:18,943 --> 01:14:20,695
He will take care
of us by giving amount.

1056
01:14:21,392 --> 01:14:22,495
- Have you spoken?
- Yes.

1057
01:14:22,575 --> 01:14:23,589
Okay.

1058
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:27,250
But Mutharasan is a mad fellow.

1059
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:28,895
- Yes. Like you.
- Why are you slapping me?

1060
01:14:28,919 --> 01:14:31,377
How will that mad boy love that girl?

1061
01:14:31,457 --> 01:14:35,051
We should set up things so
that the mad boy will love that girl.

1062
01:14:35,131 --> 01:14:37,118
Work load is increasing.

1063
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:40,394
Amount will also increase
according to work load.

1064
01:14:40,474 --> 01:14:42,121
- Deal okay.
- Okay.

1065
01:14:42,859 --> 01:14:46,467
He suspected everything.
Why is he sitting silently?

1066
01:14:47,003 --> 01:14:49,678
What is my role in this?

1067
01:14:49,758 --> 01:14:53,967
Desilt and clean the pond.
Then fill it with water.

1068
01:14:54,047 --> 01:14:55,848
You will take four weeks for that.

1069
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,564
He has fallen down.

1070
01:15:01,644 --> 01:15:03,663
Get up.(GROANS)

1071
01:15:03,743 --> 01:15:05,663
You can't play even 10 games.
Get up and go away.

1072
01:15:05,836 --> 01:15:09,177
Give the stone. Give.

1073
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:11,173
You play.

1074
01:15:14,756 --> 01:15:15,915
Talkative girl has come.

1075
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:22,296
Come here.

1076
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:24,680
Come. Let us run away.

1077
01:15:24,907 --> 01:15:28,255
- Wait. Do not run.
- I will also come.

1078
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:31,800
Wait. Why are you getting
scared of me and running away?

1079
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:35,611
Look! I am not scared of anyone.

1080
01:15:35,935 --> 01:15:39,269
I am extremely happy.
Come. Let us run together.

1081
01:15:39,349 --> 01:15:41,621
Don't you want to see Sona?

1082
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:45,949
You are tickling me.

1083
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:49,207
I feel different.

1084
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:52,981
I thought I can tackle him easily.
But he is not budging.

1085
01:15:53,061 --> 01:15:56,661
Silly girl!-I have to call
him lovingly to lure him!

1086
01:15:59,093 --> 01:16:02,235
He has escaped. I should not spare him.

1087
01:16:02,924 --> 01:16:05,792
I am going to play.

1088
01:16:06,032 --> 01:16:07,071
Hey!

1089
01:16:09,098 --> 01:16:11,182
Where are you going?

1090
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,281
Tell. Where are you going?

1091
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:15,349
- Tell me. Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

1092
01:16:15,552 --> 01:16:16,630
Tell me.

1093
01:16:17,302 --> 01:16:18,478
Nowhere.

1094
01:16:18,868 --> 01:16:21,714
Then why did you come out?

1095
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:25,111
I am going to play.

1096
01:16:25,191 --> 01:16:26,514
With small children?

1097
01:16:28,379 --> 01:16:29,757
You are grown up.

1098
01:16:30,739 --> 01:16:32,717
You are born to bring ill fame to me.

1099
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,923
- Go inside.
- No, Father.

1100
01:16:35,003 --> 01:16:36,707
I am going to play.

1101
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:38,570
Are you answering me back?

1102
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:40,653
- How many times shall I tell you?
- Father!

1103
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:44,002
How many times should I tell
you not to play with small children?

1104
01:16:44,156 --> 01:16:46,467
- You will not change even if I hit you.
- Do not hit him.

1105
01:16:46,547 --> 01:16:48,729
I feel ashamed to walk on the road
because of him. -Leave him.

1106
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:49,882
Do not beat him. You...!

1107
01:16:49,962 --> 01:16:52,485
- Is this the way to bring up a child?
- What was his mistake?

1108
01:16:52,565 --> 01:16:55,440
Mistake? He has spoiled my reputation.

1109
01:16:55,576 --> 01:16:57,432
Go inside. Go.

1110
01:16:57,814 --> 01:16:59,163
- Go inside.
- Do not beat him.

1111
01:17:00,097 --> 01:17:02,224
Get up. Go inside.

1112
01:17:03,269 --> 01:17:04,407
Go.

1113
01:17:04,962 --> 01:17:06,570
Why are they sleeping like this?

1114
01:17:07,277 --> 01:17:08,951
Money order has come.

1115
01:17:09,031 --> 01:17:10,233
Where?

1116
01:17:10,313 --> 01:17:11,403
Is he Money order?

1117
01:17:11,483 --> 01:17:13,162
He is the project to get money.
I meant that.

1118
01:17:13,186 --> 01:17:14,393
Hey! Come here.

1119
01:17:14,473 --> 01:17:15,513
You will hit me if I come.

1120
01:17:15,557 --> 01:17:17,928
We will beat you even
if you do not come. Come here.

1121
01:17:18,105 --> 01:17:19,111
- Come fast.
- Stand here.

1122
01:17:19,191 --> 01:17:20,197
Come here.

1123
01:17:22,645 --> 01:17:23,975
Do you know Sona?

1124
01:17:24,363 --> 01:17:26,082
- I don't know.
- He said he doesn't know.

1125
01:17:26,162 --> 01:17:27,623
Let us return back the advance.

1126
01:17:27,703 --> 01:17:30,656
When did I take advance that
you want me to return it back?

1127
01:17:30,736 --> 01:17:31,986
Keep quiet for some time.

1128
01:17:32,959 --> 01:17:37,646
You were scratching
someone near the rock.

1129
01:17:37,726 --> 01:17:40,071
- She is Sona. Do you know?
- I do not know.

1130
01:17:40,151 --> 01:17:41,352
Wait. I will ask now.

1131
01:17:42,673 --> 01:17:45,065
You said you will ask him.
Why are you beating me?

1132
01:17:45,145 --> 01:17:46,646
- Hey!
- Yes, I know.

1133
01:17:46,726 --> 01:17:47,935
Now he has agreed.

1134
01:17:48,097 --> 01:17:50,351
If you had told earlier,
I would have been spared of a slap.

1135
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:52,800
Do you like Sona?

1136
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,365
- I don't like.
- Why?

1137
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:59,587
Because she touches here.
Touches there. She does awkward things.

1138
01:17:59,806 --> 01:18:02,992
- So I do not like her.
- That is why we like her.

1139
01:18:03,072 --> 01:18:04,923
Then you keep her. Super!

1140
01:18:05,207 --> 01:18:10,047
Why Super?! Will we get money
if he keeps Sona. He is a miser.

1141
01:18:10,127 --> 01:18:11,192
Yes.

1142
01:18:11,272 --> 01:18:15,075
If you irritate us by talking
incoherently, I will punch your face.

1143
01:18:15,155 --> 01:18:17,686
- You should love Sona.
- Love means?

1144
01:18:17,766 --> 01:18:18,918
Alas!

1145
01:18:19,064 --> 01:18:23,134
I think we have to teach
from the scratch for him.

1146
01:18:23,214 --> 01:18:24,918
Wait. Do not irritate me.

1147
01:18:24,998 --> 01:18:28,428
You should go to Sona now and say,
'I love you'.

1148
01:18:28,761 --> 01:18:32,936
- If I say?
- She will hug and kiss you.

1149
01:18:33,016 --> 01:18:35,085
Even my neighbor aunty kisses me.

1150
01:18:35,603 --> 01:18:38,497
You could have born like him!

1151
01:18:38,577 --> 01:18:40,768
You could have born in any manner.
Still you would have been a waste.

1152
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:43,042
Keep quiet. Do not frustrate me.

1153
01:18:43,122 --> 01:18:46,671
Look! You should go to Sona now and say,
'I love you'

1154
01:18:46,751 --> 01:18:49,002
I will tell. But when should I tell?

1155
01:18:49,823 --> 01:18:51,029
This is right question.

1156
01:18:51,109 --> 01:18:53,857
Friday 7.30 - 9 A.M. is auspicious time.

1157
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:59,310
You take bath. Wear silk
dress and a chain around your neck.

1158
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:00,860
Go straight to Mango grove.

1159
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:04,742
And then with a rose in
hand you should say, 'I love you'.

1160
01:19:04,822 --> 01:19:06,790
Will I get rose flower in Mango grove?

1161
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:09,222
Then go to Papaya grove and give!

1162
01:19:09,302 --> 01:19:11,472
- Will I get in Papaya grove?
- What is he saying?

1163
01:19:13,042 --> 01:19:16,093
I will take a share auto
and buy you a rose flower.

1164
01:19:16,173 --> 01:19:18,362
Please say, 'I love you'.

1165
01:19:18,442 --> 01:19:20,116
- I will tell.
- Tell. Go now.

1166
01:19:20,196 --> 01:19:21,241
- I will tell.
- Run.

1167
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:22,710
- He is delaying so much.
- Rascal!

1168
01:19:23,223 --> 01:19:26,659
Come. Let 3 of us share that amount.

1169
01:19:26,739 --> 01:19:30,297
Stupid! Why are you talking
about advance and sharing the amount?

1170
01:19:30,377 --> 01:19:32,669
We will get the amount
only if they love.

1171
01:19:32,749 --> 01:19:34,260
Stupid fellow!

1172
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:36,125
I am sorry. Come. Let us go.

1173
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:38,709
- What is it?
- I wonder what his doubt is now!

1174
01:19:38,789 --> 01:19:39,804
What is it, My dear?

1175
01:19:40,038 --> 01:19:43,979
Will you set up something
like this for me?

1176
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,770
Hit him.

01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:50,482

Are you asking to do a pimp's job?

1178
01:19:50,562 --> 01:19:51,617
I will squeeze you.

1179
01:20:01,599 --> 01:20:03,999
Hi Darling! What are you doing here?

1180
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,567
Why did you come here?
Why are you following me?

1181
01:20:07,647 --> 01:20:11,133
You are alone in the grove.

1182
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:14,457
So I came to give this.

1183
01:20:14,537 --> 01:20:16,282
I do not like this.

1184
01:20:17,214 --> 01:20:19,273
Do you know about
your likes and dislikes?

1185
01:20:19,963 --> 01:20:22,079
Then you know everything.

1186
01:20:22,314 --> 01:20:23,628
I do not know anything.

1187
01:20:23,977 --> 01:20:27,293
You are always roaming in the garden.

1188
01:20:27,373 --> 01:20:31,794
Come. Let us go to park,
beach or coffee shop.

1189
01:20:31,874 --> 01:20:36,512
I do not know all that. I will not come.

1190
01:20:36,592 --> 01:20:38,117
Why are you calling me there?

1191
01:20:39,017 --> 01:20:42,115
I am bored of roaming
behind you and this place.

1192
01:20:42,195 --> 01:20:43,842
Why should I bother about you?

1193
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,253
Why are you saying like this?

1194
01:20:45,552 --> 01:20:50,781
I took bath early in the morning,
and met the astrologer for our sake.

1195
01:20:51,024 --> 01:20:56,489
He said all the ten points
in our horoscope match.

1196
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,662
Wait. I will tell my father about this.

1197
01:20:58,742 --> 01:21:01,354
Tell. I have become friendly with you.

1198
01:21:01,434 --> 01:21:04,799
Is it difficult to convince your father?

1199
01:21:05,091 --> 01:21:07,686
- I will show you a beautiful picture.
- No.

Is it a new matter to our family?

We should love.

Didn't I love you?

How should we do?

1211
01:21:43,251 --> 01:21:48,245
We should love someone

But he loves a girl who has nothing.

1213

01:22:21,829 --> 01:22:23,280
I should somehow catch him.

1221
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,512
I will come. Wait.

1222
01:22:27,545 --> 01:22:28,559
Hi Dear!

1223
01:22:31,056 --> 01:22:34,145
I will tell my father
if you do like this.

1224
01:22:34,225 --> 01:22:37,388
Tell. Even I expect that to happen.

1225
01:22:37,468 --> 01:22:39,156
Talk without touching me.

1226
01:22:39,415 --> 01:22:43,396
Touch me if you can.

1227
01:22:43,931 --> 01:22:45,447
I do not like all this.

1228
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:47,758
- Touch me.
- I will not touch anyone.

1229
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:50,920
You need not touch. I will touch you.

1230
01:22:51,157 --> 01:22:56,661
I will touch your eyes...
your nose... your lips.

1231
01:22:56,741 --> 01:22:59,553
- I do not like such things.
- Why are you feeling so shy?

1232
01:22:59,785 --> 01:23:03,292
You are doing awkward things to me.
Leave me.

1233
01:23:03,758 --> 01:23:05,289
I want to go home.

1234
01:23:05,369 --> 01:23:09,059
We started just now. Why are
you asking me to finish it so soon?

1235
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:10,884
Leave me.

1236
01:23:11,735 --> 01:23:12,875
Where are you going?

1237
01:23:13,163 --> 01:23:16,265
Go. Your work starts now.

1238
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,609
Why is that girl following me always?

1239
01:23:19,884 --> 01:23:22,580
Even my parents do not love me.

1240
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:25,569
But she loves me very much.

1241
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,420
So let me listen to her from now.

1242
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:42,567
Why did you call me here?

1243
01:23:42,803 --> 01:23:44,840
There is some matter.

1244
01:23:45,489 --> 01:23:46,766
What is the matter?

1245
01:23:46,846 --> 01:23:50,789
You like if I kiss you. Isn't it?

1246
01:23:50,869 --> 01:23:52,938
I called you to give that.

1247
01:23:53,018 --> 01:23:55,076
Do you know all that?

1248
01:23:55,309 --> 01:23:57,377
I know everything.

1249
01:23:57,457 --> 01:24:00,174
Look! This is for you.

1250
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,320
Why are you doing like this?

1251
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,809
That...

1252
01:24:12,124 --> 01:24:14,809

you if you wear this?

1316

1317

Did they agree?

1318
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:31,821
Why should I tell that to my family?

01:33:21,287 --> 01:33:23,417
Then don't they own any of these things?

1398
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:25,434
No. They have nothing.

1399
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:27,957
You are a mad girl.

1400
01:33:28,037 --> 01:33:32,396
O God! You should
change this girl's fate.

1401
01:33:32,801 --> 01:33:34,687
O God! Save this girl.

1402

(SOBS)

1403
01:34:01,358 --> 01:34:04,464
Sona! Why are you
sitting here like this?

1404
01:34:05,583 --> 01:34:08,364
Come. Let us get married.

1405
01:34:09,386 --> 01:34:10,894
Come.

1406
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:13,894
- Come soon.
- Take off your hand, You mad fellow!

1407
01:34:13,974 --> 01:34:15,541
Do not stand in front of me. Go away.

1408
01:34:15,621 --> 01:34:19,360
Will anyone love you?
I loved you. Why?

1409
01:34:19,546 --> 01:34:22,708
I wanted to enjoy your wealth.

1410
01:34:22,788 --> 01:34:25,871
That is why I loved you.
You are a pauper.

1411
01:34:26,187 --> 01:34:28,011
Do not think about
me even in your dream.

1412
01:34:28,091 --> 01:34:30,038

1413

Come. Come.

1427
01:35:15,656 --> 01:35:17,842
Sona. Why are you sitting like this?

1428
01:35:19,353 --> 01:35:20,741
Is this new for us?

1429
01:35:20,955 --> 01:35:24,299
Or Are you acting for the first time?
Or do you really love him?

1430
01:35:24,664 --> 01:35:26,590
Nothing of that sort.

1431
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:27,674
Then what is the problem?

1432
01:35:27,754 --> 01:35:30,745
We have cheated many
persons before this.

1433
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:35,235
But I feel bad for having
cheated this mad boy.

1434
01:35:36,219 --> 01:35:39,735
You should live and I should also live.

1435
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:44,961
So we should not bother
about sin or virtue.

1436
01:35:45,123 --> 01:35:48,366
We will get some other guy.
Come. Let us go.

1437
01:35:49,631 --> 01:35:50,985
Come.

1438
01:35:52,525 --> 01:35:53,964
Hey!

1439
01:35:55,568 --> 01:35:57,839
- Father!
- Are you my son?

1440
01:35:58,009 --> 01:36:00,360
You have insulted me
in front of the people here.

1441
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:02,467
- Father!
- Do not beat him.

1442
01:36:02,547 --> 01:36:03,879
Leave me.

1443
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:07,164
Nobody is respecting
me here because of you.

1444
01:36:07,244 --> 01:36:08,397
Leave me.

1445
01:36:08,817 --> 01:36:09,968
Father, Be patient.

1446
01:36:10,048 --> 01:36:11,289
You should not be alive.

1447
01:36:11,369 --> 01:36:15,311
I will not get back
my honor even after you die.

1448
01:36:15,391 --> 01:36:16,738
No, Father.

1449
01:36:16,818 --> 01:36:20,937
My anger will subside
only if I kill you.

1450
01:36:21,017 --> 01:36:22,396
- Leave him.
- Go!

1451
01:36:22,631 --> 01:36:27,349
I lost my prestige
and honor because of you.

1452
01:36:27,429 --> 01:36:28,703
Leave him.

1453
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:31,006
Do not stand before me.
Go away somewhere. Go.

1454
01:36:31,086 --> 01:36:33,049
- Sir, Come.
- You go.

1455
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:37,201
If I see you again in this place,
I will kill you.

1456
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:38,458
Go away somewhere.

1457
01:36:43,525 --> 01:36:49,160
Sona! I will not spare you.

1458
01:36:49,849 --> 01:36:51,653
We suspect your son.

1459
01:36:51,866 --> 01:36:53,224
My son!

1460
01:36:53,396 --> 01:36:56,193
It will be confirmed in
a day or two if it is your son.

1461
01:36:56,273 --> 01:36:59,911
For the sake of this
village and villagers

1462
01:37:00,592 --> 01:37:03,686
either you should kill
him or I should kill him.

1463
01:37:04,011 --> 01:37:08,206
Okay. You have to cooperate
with us in this case.

1464
01:37:08,286 --> 01:37:10,700
I will surely cooperate. You may go.

1465
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:12,332
- Okay. See you then.
- Bye.

1466
01:37:12,748 --> 01:37:14,004
Come.

1467
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:21,261
Hey!

1468
01:37:22,994 --> 01:37:24,889
O Goddess! Who are you?

1469
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:29,764
Are you asking who I am?
I am Angalaparameswari.

1470
01:37:30,413 --> 01:37:32,460
I am unable to bear it.

1471
01:37:32,734 --> 01:37:35,896
O Mother! What is your problem?

1472
01:37:36,058 --> 01:37:39,362
Do you know what is
happening in this village?

1473
01:37:39,442 --> 01:37:40,831
I will know only if you say.

1474
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:45,007
Do you know why I'm dancing
so aggressively? -Tell me.

1475
01:37:45,624 --> 01:37:48,401
Wrong deeds are happening in this place.

1476
01:37:48,615 --> 01:37:50,774
I am not happy.

1477
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:52,760
If I should be happy...

1478
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:55,872
- What should we do for that?
- Pacify my mind.

1479
01:37:56,074 --> 01:37:57,807
Okay. We will perform festival.

1480
01:37:58,821 --> 01:38:03,614
You need not worry after that.
I am there for you.

01:50:06,737 --> 01:50:07,799
Do not run. Stop.

1576
01:50:08,334 --> 01:50:09,398
Stop.

1577
01:50:12,151 --> 01:50:15,180
Do not run. Stop.

1578
01:50:15,629 --> 01:50:17,965
All of you come.

1579
01:50:25,723 --> 01:50:27,215
Come.

1580
01:51:06,507 --> 01:51:08,749
You couldn't catch me!

1581
01:51:16,985 --> 01:51:18,209
Come.

1582
01:51:21,323 --> 01:51:24,607
I am extremely fond of Love.

1583
01:51:24,866 --> 01:51:30,055
But I do not like those who love.

1584
01:51:30,306 --> 01:51:34,571
I am Dharma. I am Yama (GOD OF DEATH).

1585
01:51:39,451 --> 01:51:41,901
Whatever be the ending,

1586
01:51:42,752 --> 01:51:46,318
the decision should be mine.

1587
01:51:48,061 --> 01:51:51,321
I wished that I should live.

1588
01:51:52,577 --> 01:51:56,436
But I lived without

1589
01:51:58,212 --> 01:52:01,577
understanding this world.

1590
01:52:03,266 --> 01:52:07,827
I was cheated because
I believed in a love

1591
01:52:10,386 --> 01:52:13,262
which was for money and property.

1592
01:52:16,062 --> 01:52:18,823
I also loved a girl.

1593
01:52:19,054 --> 01:52:22,409
When she loved me,

1594
01:52:22,946 --> 01:52:25,429
I didn't know the meaning for that.

1595
01:52:25,509 --> 01:52:29,290
But I understood

1596
01:52:30,415 --> 01:52:33,800
its meaning only when I loved.

1597
01:52:34,782 --> 01:52:36,830
(EXHALES)

1598
01:52:37,164 --> 01:52:42,008
That was not love or lust.

1599
01:52:43,843 --> 01:52:46,468
(LAUGHING)

1600
01:52:46,752 --> 01:52:49,610
Money.

1601
01:52:52,275 --> 01:52:55,022
Should one love for the
sake of money and property?

1602
01:52:55,853 --> 01:52:56,968
Tell me.

1603
01:53:01,123 --> 01:53:06,383
They should not.

1604
01:53:07,315 --> 01:53:11,906
Love should not happen
for the sake of money.

1605
01:53:12,433 --> 01:53:16,112
(CRYING)

1606
01:53:23,755 --> 01:53:26,248
I wanted to kill her.

1607
01:53:28,143 --> 01:53:32,420
But I could not.

1608
01:53:32,977 --> 01:53:36,824
But I searched all those
who were like her,

1609
01:53:36,904 --> 01:53:39,879
and killed them.

1610
01:53:39,959 --> 01:53:41,156
I killed them.

1611
01:53:43,042 --> 01:53:48,692
But I could not kill her.

1612
01:53:49,896 --> 01:53:51,479
I could not kill.

1613
01:53:51,778 --> 01:53:53,441
I could not kill.

1614
01:54:00,478 --> 01:54:03,015
I have done this mistake.

1615
01:54:03,095 --> 01:54:07,534
But those like me
do not make this mistake.

1616
01:54:08,107 --> 01:54:10,191
None of you should make this mistake.

1617
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:12,685
Please, None of you
should make this mistake.

1618
01:54:12,765 --> 01:54:16,015
None of you make this mistake.

1619
01:54:16,258 --> 01:54:20,418
I will be born again
in this earth as a child.

1620
01:54:20,498 --> 01:54:22,509
I will be born again.

1621
01:54:22,661 --> 01:54:24,607
I will be born again.

1622
01:54:24,951 --> 01:54:27,090
I will be born again.

1623
01:54:27,699 --> 01:54:30,324
(SLITS)
