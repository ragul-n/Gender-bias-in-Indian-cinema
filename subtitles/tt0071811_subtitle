1
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,958
Thank you, Dinshaw.

3
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,708
Young man, would you
like a glass of whiskey?

4
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,208
Well, I wouldn't mind.

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,041
Here you go.

6
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,000
-Thank you.
-Bawa, would you like a glass too?

7
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,208
-Yes, of course.

8
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,125
Thank you.

9
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,666
No Dinshaw,
or else say goodbye to our honeymoon.

10
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,708
Our honeymoon will end
when we reach Jamshedpur.

11
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:35,041
-There's still time for that.
-Ok.

12
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:39,625
-Only one peg.
-Oh yes... one peg. One single.

13
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,541
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

14
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,875
Cheers!

15
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,250
Did you come to Mumbai
for your honeymoon?

16
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,708
Yes. It was my first experience
and my wife's second.

17
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:51,666
Hey...

18
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,041
No, I mean to say...

19
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:58,000
This is my second experience,
and my wife's first.

20
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,916
Why did you both go to Mumbai
for your honeymoon?

21
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,750
You should've gone to Europe.

22
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:06,750
Monte Carlo. French Riviera. Paris.

23
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,666
Boy, oh boy. I's beautiful.

24
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,666
Whom was this flying kiss for?

25
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,541
Europe.

26
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,708
-Europe?
-What a place.

27
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,375
It's got the best places to have fun.

28
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,208
What's in Mumbai?

29
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,208
-Entertainment!
-Entertainment?

30
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,791
Entertainment!

31
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,666
You can get that anywhere.

32
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,708
Manoranjan Street
isn't everywhere.

33
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,750
It's only in Mumbai.

34
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,750
Manoranjan Street?

35
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,416
What do you get to see there?

36
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,333
You get to see life, young man.

37
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:44,625
Life!

38
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:50,708
That place is packed with goodness,
evil... not disappointment.

39
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,625
People have the courage
to lead their lives...

40
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,333
and they know how to change with time.

41
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,166
Today it's a different place...

42
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,083
but, it had a different facet before.

43
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,833
-But maybe some other day.
-Why some other day?

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,916
Tell us now... what is it all about?

45
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:11,208
Yes... tell us now, what is so
fantastic about Ganomanjan Street.

46
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,833
Not Ganomanjan Street, Bawa.

47
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,500
Manoranjan Street.

48
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,541
Right, Manoranjan Street.

49
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:22,708
When the world slept...
Manoranjan Street would wake up.

50
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,750
And it was filled with entertainment.

51
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,833
Entertainment!

52
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,291
You are here.

53
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,583
Gaurang.

54
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:09,416
-How are you, Dhoop Chhaon?
-Hale and hearty.

55
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:49,916
Did he leave?

56
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,041
Constable, be careful!

57
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,000
For you. It's fresh.

58
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,833
-I can't afford it.
-Can't afford it?

59
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,832
-Banana.
-Yes, of course.

60
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,291
Have a banana.

61
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,625
Here.

62
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,083
Money? What for?

63
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,375
For this.

64
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:14,040
Don't you give a hand to the fallen?

65
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,540
This is a tough job,
you fell down yourself.

66
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,750
You... look like a decent lady.

67
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,250
-Really?
-Yes.

68
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,583
It was entirely my fault.
You didn't get angry at me.

69
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,541
In fact, you smiled
before I could apologize.

70
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,083
Well, one has to curb their emotions
when dealing with the uniform.

71
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,458
Oh no, you don't need
to be scared of this uniform.

72
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,833
The police are here
to serve the people.

73
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,458
There's no doubt in that.

74
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,666
The people in this area have
their way because of guys like you.

75
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,708
But... I find something
suspicious in this area.

76
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,833
-Suspicious?
-Yes... Take a look.

77
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,375
Get it?

78
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,290
Yes, I do... you're new here.

79
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,916
Yes, I am... so what?

80
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,000
I have the brain of a detective.

81
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:30,125
I am 200 percent sure,
that girl... is fishy.

82
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,208
-How?
-You know, fishy...

83
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,083
Don't you understand?

84
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,666
How do I explain this to you?

85
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,665
It would've been so much
easier if you were a man.

86
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,166
Are you not that open with women?

87
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,166
No.

88
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,625
You see, there was a
girl standing right there.

89
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,125
A man arrived in a taxi.

90
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,165
That midget pounced towards that man.

91
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,250
And whispered something in his ear.

92
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,500
Next, he headed in
the direction of that girl.

93
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,290
And whispered something in her ear.

94
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,750
Later, that man and the
girl went inside this hotel.

95
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,040
Think about it...

96
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,708
Why did those two go in there?

97
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,416
To whisper?

98
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,750
You're too naive.

99
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,165
I think it's not right
for you to stay here.

100
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,041
Why is that?

101
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,208
Some philanderer might
mistake you for one of them.

102
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,333
You mean... like her.

103
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,500
Now you understand.

104
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:26,625
Please leave,
I'll investigate what's going on here.

105
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,958
What's this all about?

106
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:28,958
Listen...

107
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,958
I would like to meet
the owner of this place.

108
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,041
That's me. The name's Dhoop Chhaon.

109
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,041
-Gaurang.
-Dhoop Chhaon?

110
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,458
Is that your name?

111
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,333
Trademark.

112
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,000
I changed many professions.

113
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,583
After humiliating my parents
dozens of times, I earned this name.

114
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,208
Painful experience... and quick wits.

115
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,708
Well, I want your opinion.

116
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,833
You know that hotel... Hotel Mauj,
how is it?

117
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:27,915
It's trustworthy.

118
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,500
They don't ask for
your name and address.

119
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,291
No... you don't understand.

120
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,958
I noticed three men
enter that place with women.

121
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,750
Or maybe, three women
entered that place with men.

122
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,708
It's Monday, business is low.

123
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,750
Yesterday,
almost ten entered by this time.

124
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,125
But those girls didn't
look decent to me.

125
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,958
They were standing on the street.

126
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,208
They made some gestures.

127
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,500
Some whispering...

128
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,583
You are not allowed to do
anything beyond this on the streets.

129
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,125
You have to go to a hotel.

130
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,625
Yes... my suspicion was right.

131
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,625
Those girls are prostitutes.

132
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,625
The oldest profession in the world.

133
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:05,458
-Spreading love.
-But it's illegal. It's a crime.

134
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,125
You're absolutely right.

135
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,000
Spreading love in this
sham world is a crime.

136
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,833
But you're completely
free to spread hate.

137
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,458
You can publicly
humiliate a human being.

138
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,375
But you can't publicly
show your love to your beloved.

139
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,833
One has to hide in dark corners,
like thieves.

140
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,083
It's not love... it's lust.

141
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,208
One has to eradicate this
filth from decent societies.

142
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,916
What you call filth,
is enjoyment for this society,

143
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,500
and all thanks to your
so called decent people.

144
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,458
-You're absolutely wrong.
-I am absolutely right.

145
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,958
Why are you screaming?
Let's have a debate.

146
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,708
-Take this away, Gaurang.
-Prove it.

147
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,916
Also this.

148
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,833
Listen carefully.

149
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,875
A decent man is 45 years old.

150
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,166
Poor guy works all
day and returns home...

151
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,958
only to have an
argument with his wife.

152
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:57,125
-The other decent guy is 25 years old.
-What is his problem?

153
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:01,458
Inflation is increasing at a rate...

154
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,000
-What rate?
-He can't get married.

155
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,708
The Bachelor is tired of loneliness...

156
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,083
and the middle aged
man is tired of his wife.

157
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,500
Both of them head this way.

158
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,791
Pick their girls,
get some entertainment.

159
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,916
Later, the girl gives
that money to her protector.

160
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,625
Then that money passes
from one to another.

161
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,833
The protector buys liquor
from that decent man's shop.

162
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,166
Then that decent man
buys a ring from the jeweler.

163
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,000
He even gives away some
of that money to the police.

164
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:26,875
Bribe?

165
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,500
That's the beauty of an illegal business.

166
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,790
The lion and the goat
drink water at the same river.

167
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,291
-Everyone's happy, everyone's elated.
-I don't believe it.

168
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,208
A policeman can never take a bribe.

169
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,416
Brother, this is the most
sought after business in this era.

170
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,375
Understand?

171
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,415
I used to be a secretary
of a corrupt politician.

172
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,916
In a year, I helped him
build a manor worth a million.

173
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,708
But, I'll tell you about it
some other day.

174
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,875
Right, some other day.
Even I don't have time to spare.

175
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,000
-Can I make a call?
-Of course.

176
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,250
But be careful about what you say.

177
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,833
Trying to imbibe honesty
in this corrupt world...

178
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,875
is like trying
to bell the cat.

179
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,541
It's impossible.

180
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,458
And even if you do,
it'll scratch you back.

181
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,625
Hello. Police Station.

182
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,540
This is constable Ratan.

183
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,458
Send a police van to Hotel Mauj.

184
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,540
Suppression of immoral traffic act.

185
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,290
You know English.

186
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,083
I've done my high school, from Nagpur.

187
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,833
According to section 3 of that act...

188
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,541
another couple just entered...

189
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,666
no, not in the section.
I meant, in the hotel.

190
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,625
Send the police van over,
we have to conduct a raid.

191
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,750
Yeah.

192
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,833
So you're hell bent
on belling the cat.

193
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,416
Anyway, maybe I can be of some help.

194
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,250
Will you testify?

195
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,958
I can give you work.

196
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,958
Soon you'll need one.

197
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,040
Gaurang, here's the change.

198
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,665
This one's permitted.

199
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,416
If a fire ever breaks
out in the hotel...

200
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
is there any arrangement
to save your guests?

201
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,750
There's the fire alarm.

202
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,333
The alarms start ringing
when you break the glass.

203
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,916
And all the guests will come down.

204
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,791
What are you doing? There's no fire.

205
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,125
But where's the fire?

206
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,333
Here.

207
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,791
Line up. Come on... in a line.

208
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,291
Fatso... you would've had
to pay up after two minutes.

209
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,916
-Give me my money.
-Help!

210
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,540
-Enough of this yelling... now leave him.
-Give it to me.

211
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,208
You go that way...

212
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,208
What is all this commotion? Quiet!

213
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:04,041
See... according to the law,
I cannot arrest the men.

214
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,916
Hey, that way.

215
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:09,208
But... I will need your testaments.

216
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:12,915
-What is your name?
-Anand Moje.

217
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,374
Anand Moje.

218
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,957
-What is your name?
-Mann Mauji.

219
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:17,915
Mann...

220
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:22,832
-And, maybe you are Chagan Mauji.
-It's Taran Mauji.

221
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,916
What's your name?

222
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:29,541
Beat Constable Ratan, Nagpur return.

223
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,582
But, why should I tell you?

224
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,582
I am conducting the
investigation here, not you.

225
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,791
Do you know who you're talking to?

226
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,125
Someone who got beaten up by his wife?

227
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,125
-Shut up!
-Quiet!

228
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,250
You dropped my baton!

229
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,500
Get inside.

230
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,416
This is all because of that constable.

231
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,000
Who does he think he is!

232
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,541
I will break his limbs.

233
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,416
He took everyone.

234
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,416
How will we make a living now?

235
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:32,916
Uncle, we've become orphans.

236
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,375
This is all your fault.

237
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,416
Workers around the world
have finally opened their eyes...

238
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,625
and you guys are still sleeping.

239
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,041
Wake up... and make a union.

240
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,333
Union?

241
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,083
But our line of work is illegal.

242
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,125
You need to struggle hard
to make this business legal.

243
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,333
And, in order to struggle,
you need a union.

244
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,082
I know the power of a union.

245
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,916
I was once the President of a Union.

246
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,291
-What was that union for?
-Beggars.

247
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,791
But, I'll tell you about it
some other day.

248
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,875
"We've become orphans..."

249
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,958
Kanhaiyya, you broke up
our foreplay back at the hotel...

250
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,875
so, how about we have some fun here.

251
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,708
-Sorry.
-Your sorry isn't enough, pick it up.

252
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,375
Look who you're talking to.

253
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,583
-Please pick it up.
-Ok.

254
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,958
Forgive me, the driver
applied a sudden brake.

255
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,916
-Maybe it's a red light.
-But it's a green light from me.

256
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,041
Don't hold yourself back, my love.

257
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,791
-You?
-Yes, me.

258
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,583
What are you doing here?

259
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,916
Like the rest of them.

260
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,875
You mean even you are...

261
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,457
Yes, one of them.

262
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,625
Whispering type.

263
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,750
<i>"Listen up"</i>

264
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,625
<i>"Catch those"</i>

265
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:45,208

266
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,625

267
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:54,583
<i>"We spread joy in this world"</i>

268
00:21:54,958 --> 00:22:00,166
<i>"Why are you crying?"</i>

269
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:04,333
<i>"The bride's on her way home"</i>

270
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:09,750

271
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:14,250

00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:19,582

00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:23,666
<i>"The bride's on her way home"</i>

00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,625
<i>"I will dance and sing"</i>

275
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,375
<i>"I won't go"</i>

276
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,958
<i>-"I will dance and sing"
-"I won't go"</i>

277
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,333
<i>"Bring the flowery veil"</i>

278
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,375
<i>"Bring the flowery veil"</i>

279
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:15,958
<i>"Let me deck you up"</i>

280
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,083
<i>"Oh, beloved... leave my arm"</i>

281
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:26,041
<i>"Cover my face with the veil"</i>

282
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:31,207
<i>"I am missing my father"</i>

283
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,791

284
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:41,000

<i>"The bride's on her way home"</i>

00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,041
<i>"Open your eyes
Say something"</i>

288
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,625
<i>"Open your eyes
Say something"</i>

289
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,666

00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:51,457

00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:55,958
<i>"Oh, beloved
Look into my eyes"</i>

292
00:24:56,125 --> 00:25:00,708

<i>"The bride's on her way home"</i>

301
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,250
Ratan sir.

302
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:23,541
Welcome, welcome...
we've been waiting for you.

303
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:27,291
Lock them all up.
There's a dozen of them.

304
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:31,457
Register a case...
Suppression of Immoral Act.

305
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:35,207
-Immortal Act?
-No... Immoral Act.

306
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:36,582
Act Immoral.

307
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:39,916
No... I mean, it's Immoral Traffic Act.

308
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,832
Relax...

309
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,166
Were you wrestling with the dozen?

310
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,166
They are a bunch of miscreants.

311
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,166
-Lock them all up.
-As you wish.

312
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,291
First, go meet the inspector.

313
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,916
He's been waiting for you eagerly.

314
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,541
-Eagerly?
-Yeah...

315
00:26:56,625 --> 00:27:00,708
-For what
-He might get you a medal for this.

316
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:02,250
-Medal?
-Yes.

317
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,333
Unbelievable, I just joined today...
I am already getting a medal.

318
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:10,666
-Should I congratulate you?
-After I get the medal.

319
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,875
Ok.

320
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:14,916
See you.

321
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,916
Are your hands stuck,
finish saluting me?

322
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,541
So you're the new recruit...

323
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,333
I wanted to know who's
been newly transferred here.

324
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:57,707
-You've already seen me, sir.
-I have... where?

325
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:02,958
Back at Hotel Mauj... just a while ago.

326
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,958
Did you... forget, sir?

327
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,582
I don't remember.
What was I doing there?

328
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,166
I don't know, sir.

329
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,375
You were doing something upstairs.

330
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:15,250
The alarm rang, you came down.

331
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,708
-That's when I saw you.
-Shut up!

332
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:18,957
You must be dreaming.

333
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,458
No, sir. I was conducting a raid.

334
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:25,541
Why did you conduct a raid?
With whose permission?

335
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,083
The law, sir.

336
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,041
Suffocation of Immorality.

337
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,833
Are you trying to teach me law?

338
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,125
-I know the law better than you.
-Yes, sir.

339
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:39,083
Look at yourself...
What have you done with your uniform?

340
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,250
Take off your cap... take it off!

341
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,500
Bread cream and some fritters.

342
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,625
It's you.

343
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,583
You look more like a timid rat.

344
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,291
Did the cat scratch you?

345
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:28,500
No... it was a big tiger.

346
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:31,416
That bugger still has his job,

347
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,583
-and me...
-...fired from the job.

348
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,000
And ousted from my home too.
I am on the streets now.

349
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,416
Can I get something to eat?

350
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,583
I haven't eaten
anything since morning.

351
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:42,957
I only cater to those
who have deep pockets.

352
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,041
Don't worry,
I may not have a deep pocket.

353
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,375
-But, I am not exactly a pauper.
-What would you like?

354
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,541
-How about some samosa?
-Yes...

355
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,791
Take it.

356
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,208
So, you've quit your job.

357
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,416
I had the same attitude once.

358
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,250
Back during the Burma War,
I was a Colonel of the British Army.

359
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,916
But I quit the army and
wandered in the jungles instead,

360
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,875
to become a soldier
of the Azad Hind Force.

361
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:03,333
This must be before you
became that corrupt secretary.

362
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,750
I was also a wholesale trader.

363
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,666
I used to supply coffins to the army.

364
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,083
But, I'll tell you
about it some other day.

365
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,875
So, what's your next program?

366
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,291
It's hard to say.

367
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,332
Once you're fired
from the police force...

368
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,707
then it's difficult
to get any other job.

369
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,750
I've been looking for a job.

370
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,708
It's really sad to
see a young man like you...

371
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,125
get disappointed from life.

372
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:29,125
This youth is not for wasting.

373
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:32,333
You should learn...
from these brave boys.

374
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,125
This is Tingu... blade master.

375
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,333
-Hi, uncle.
-Look at his attitude.

376
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:40,875
Can you believe that
he was an ordinary pickpocket?

377
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:44,166
And him... that's Balram, aka Muscles.

378
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,583
Master masseuse.

379
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:48,250
During the day, he would
give massages at Azad Maidan...

380
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,291
and during nights,
he would break their bones.

381
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,125
They have literally
come from the streets.

382
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:55,458
They all had small beginnings,
but they had great determination.

383
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,957
They had skills,
hard work... and look at them now.

384
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,332
They have all settled down
in their profession and retired.

385
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:04,707
Girls do all the work for them,
while they have fun.

386
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,000
They can have all the fun they like.

387
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:08,958
I cannot get into
this illegal business.

388
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:12,750
You have an inferiority complex.

389
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:15,125
Why do you consider yourself
to be so weak?

390
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:17,458
Even you can do what they can.

391
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,791
No... at the most, I can pick a pocket.

392
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:27,457
But I can't watch a girl sell herself
for me, while I enjoy out here.

393
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,332
I am not worthy of such a life.

394
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:31,916
If you want to make your life worthy...

395
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,458
then, first make
yourself worthy of life.

396
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:38,666
Dhoopu... hot cup of coffee.
It's really cold out here.

397
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,583
Of course, right away.
One special coffee.

398
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,832
One special coffee.

399
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,166
What are your plans
after finishing your meal?

400
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:05,041
What do you mean?

401
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:08,791
Wouldn't you like
to taste some beauty?

402
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:15,166
If he eats too much,
there won't be any room for that.

403
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:18,666
-He doesn't have a deep pocket.
-Maybe she didn't recognize me.

404
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,958
I was in my uniform last time.

405
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,791
I do... I recognize you now.

406
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,708
The white Navy uniform, right?

407
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:27,666
No, it was blue.

408
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,041
He got you locked up for two weeks.

409
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,208
But these days he's
out on the streets himself.

410
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,333
Now I get it...
you mean the "whisper" guy.

411
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:37,457
Nisha... come here!

412
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,958
Is that it?

413
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,416
Can I get some more samosas?
I am very hungry.

414
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,250
I think you should
check your pocket first.

415
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:50,708
Your current bill is 2.80.

416
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:52,916
Don't worry, I have 15 rupees.

417
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,791
-Where?
-You don't believe me.

418
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,208
-Oh, God?
-What made you think of God?

419
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,875
Someone stole my purse.

420
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,041
Doesn't matter if
you can't pay the bill.

421
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,416
-Take off your clothes.
-Clothes?

422
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:07,083
I mean this suitcase.

423
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,082
Fine.

424
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,624
Return his suitcase, Dhoopu.

425
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,874
And then, "close your shop, Dhoopu."

426
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:14,833
Is that what you want?

427
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:17,583
You can feed him anything he wants,
and put the bill on my tab.

428
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:19,832
That's right.

429
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,333
Here you go, my brother.

430
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:23,082
You lucky bum!

431
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,666
Eat it. What are you waiting for?

432
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:32,498
You just said you're hungry.

433
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:33,916
Not anymore.

434
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:37,249
You can pay me back
whenever you have the money.

435
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:41,208
Eat all you want... I know
what it means to be hungry.

436
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,916
Why are you so grateful to me?

437
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,124
I sent you to jail.

438
00:34:47,748 --> 00:34:48,915
That was your job.

439
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:52,374
You did your work, and I did mine.

440
00:34:52,498 --> 00:34:54,790
I don't have any enmity against you.

441
00:34:56,498 --> 00:35:01,665
I never imagined that someone in this
profession can have a heart of gold.

442
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,791
I am not as good as you think.

443
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,916
This is only for food.

444
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,041
Eat it.

445
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,750
I lost again.

446
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,833
Nisha!

447
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:18,416
You're still here!

448
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:20,625
I am going...
I was just talking to him.

449
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,333
If you waste time like this,
what will happen to our business?

450
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:27,833
Let me go, Balwant!
Let me go...

451
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:33,166
Mister... I cannot tolerate Section 354.

452
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:34,833
Let her go.

453
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,875
Oh... it's you.

454
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,416
You have four seconds.

455
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,000
One...

456
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,208
Two...

457
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,750
Three...

458
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:48,750
Four...

459
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,208
He understood me clearly.

460
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,375
<i>"You break my heart"</i>

461
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:06,250
<i>"Like a toy"</i>

462
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,958
Get lost... I need a 100.

463
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,958
If you return without it,
I'll break your limbs.

464
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:15,916
Dhoopu, he broke your chair.

465
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,291
It's over. It's all over!

466
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:00,375
Now. My blood is boiling.

467
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,166
It's boiling.

468
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,166
And when my blood boils,
I become a lion.

469
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,000
Lion!

470
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:14,083
Did you hear?
Look at the lion's face!

471
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,875
Anyone else?

472
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:43,458
Whoopie... I found my man.
I found my man.

473
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:46,333
Dhoopu, I found my brave protector!

474
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,708
Dhoopu, put all your damage
on my tab.

475
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:50,750
I am calculating that.

476
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,375
Strong man.

477
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:56,708
-Keep this.
-You took my purse.

478
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:59,458
Sometimes, so I don't lose practice.

479
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:03,166
Well, now I can't make you the
scape goat because you're one of us now.

480
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,875
-How is that?
-Didn't you hear what she said?

481
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:08,833
Now you're her chief pimp.

482
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,000
-Pimp?
-Yes.

483
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,666
Pardon me,
but I don't want this grand post.

484
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,625
Don't be scared.

485
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:18,875
It's no work and all play...
Plus you get respect.

486
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,750
-Respect?
-Of course.

487
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,958
And, she's the best amongst the lot.

488
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,041
Whoever has her, is the top guy.

489
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,208
Be the lion.

490
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,791
-Lion!
-Lion!

491
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,958
Unfortunately, he challenged me alone.

492
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,875
I wish there were more,
I could've used the exercise.

493
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,375
Where are you planning
to spend the night?

494
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:40,916
We lions don't care.

495
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,666
Always wondering around.

496
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,416
And sleep wherever we like.

497
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:48,875
Here... 20 paise, tip.

498
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,208
Thank you, Tarzan.

499
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,708
-Come with me.
-Where?

500
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,458
Come on.

501
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:58,083
Three chairs, two tables...

502
00:40:58,916 --> 00:40:59,833
Gaurang!

503
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,791
Wake that bull up.

504
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:07,333
-But where are you taking me?
-To your cave.

505
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:09,791
But, why were you acting so stubborn?

506
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:16,333
-Walk proudly, like a lion.
-Yes, of course.

507
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:20,458
In there, you can escape the rain,
and the cold too.

508
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,125
-You mean your home?
-Yes.

509
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:25,000
But, don't you live in Hotel Mauj.

510
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,791
That's the place where I do business.

511
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,083
I see... And the head
office is Dhoop Chhaon Cafe.

512
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:30,041
Yes.

513
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,750
Why are you getting
wet when I have an umbrella?

514
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:34,916
Come closer.

515
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,916
I don't have thorns on my body.

516
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:41,708
What happened?

517
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,125
I felt goosebumps all over my body.

518
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,208
-Why did you smile?
-No, reason.

519
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:50,083
You walk in front, I'll follow.

520
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:51,250
Yes.

521
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,125
You won't feel goosebumps.

522
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:03,041
I guess you stay away from women.

523
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,166
Not always.

524
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,083
There was a time when
I wouldn't let go of her.

525
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,666
It was fun.

526
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:10,375
-Who was she?
-My mother.

527
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:12,958
I would never get off her lap.

528
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:16,708
I think you still
need a mother, not me.

529
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:29,083
-How's the house?
-Nice.

530
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,958
Why did you close the door?

531
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:38,750
Tonight I need some rest,
and not that Balram.

532
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,625
-Rest.
-Of course, you get some rest.

533
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:42,750
I'll go sleep in that room.

534
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:47,208
That's the bathroom.
This is the only room.

535
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:48,875
Only one room?

536
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:50,583
Then, where will you sleep

537
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:54,166
-I mean, there's two of us.
-So what?

538
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,583
This bed is big enough
for the both of us.

539
00:42:56,916 --> 00:43:00,541
You mean, you and me...
on the same bed.

540
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:01,458
No!

541
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,875
Why... Why don't you understand?

542
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,625
Let me go.

543
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:09,791
Let you go where?

544
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:11,541
You'll catch pneumonia in this state.

545
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:12,958
Take them off.

546
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,041
Don't just stand there.

547
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:19,750
Do you want me to take off your
clothes and tuck you in like a kid?

548
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,583
-No.
-Now hurry up.

549
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:22,791
I'll take it off.

550
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,958
No need to force my hand,
I'll take it off myself.

551
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:28,250
Hitler.

552
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:29,833
Absolutely Hitler.

553
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,625
She should've been in the police force.

554
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:36,208
She would've been promoted
to head constable very soon.

555
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,833
And fixed everyone in the city.

556
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:41,333
"Take off your clothes."

557
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:52,541
The vest is still dry,
I won't take it off.

558
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,250
Fine, then don't.

559
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:57,958
Stop showing attitude like a bride,
you're a man.

560
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,250
Yes, I am.

561
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,875
There's no doubt about it.

562
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,583
Please look that way.

563
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:59,458
That's a pillow,
keep it under your head.

564
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:02,083
-I like to keep it on my side.
-Hurry up.

565
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,708
You keep ordering me around.

566
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,166
Why are you being so formal?
Let's shed the formalities.

567
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,583
What's wrong with it?

568
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:10,833
Nothing, but I don't like it.

569
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,333
Now hurry up.

570
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:14,750
Ok.

571
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:20,541
You know... I never
got this opportunity.

572
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,833
This is my first experience in life.

573
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:29,541
I always slept alone
since I was five-years-old.

574
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,416
I meant ordering someone around.

575
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:34,083
Oh I see...

576
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:38,125
I never imagined I'll
meet a man like you...

577
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:40,000
who I can boss around.

578
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:46,375
Whether it was Balram or the others,
they bossed me.

579
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:47,916
They would hurt me.

580
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,958
Are you going to do that to me too?

581
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:55,166
Sometimes I think you're a fake.

582
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,541
I am not a fake.

583
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,208
I used to be naive... but now,
I understand everything.

584
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:04,541
What?

585
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:10,250
In this sham world,
it's a crime to love.

586
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:14,625
You can deem anyone as
a low caste and hate him openly.

587
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:19,416
But, one has to hide in
dark corners to love your beloved.

588
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:23,750
I see... you came here for some love.

589
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:25,833
Why didn't you tell me?

590
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,041
You're getting me wrong.

591
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,750
I was only making a point.

592
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,291
You're definitely an imposter.

593
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:31,958
Do you want a dark corner?

594
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:34,791
No... no... what are you doing?

595
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:35,916
No!

596
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,708
Leave me...

597
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,375
What are you doing?

598
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,916
Help! Help!

599
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,958
No!

600
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:58,125
Nisha! Nisha!

601
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,708
Who is Nisha?

602
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:15,791
-Me.
-I see...

603
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:20,125
I am Ratan.

604
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,458
Pleased to meet you.

605
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,375
Me too.

606
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,000
Nisha!

607
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,333
Someone's calling you.

608
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:30,500
Balram.

609
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:36,416
I see... It's Mr. Bull-brain.

610
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,000
Yes, Bull-brain...

611
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,666
Nisha!

612
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,750
Stop screaming so
early in the morning.

613
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:43,833
I want to talk.

614
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:45,541
Are you coming down,
or should I come up?

615
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,541
I am not coming down.

616
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:48,916
Here you go.

617
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:51,958
These torn rags.

618
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:54,583
Where are my suits... my silk clothes.

619
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,375
I paid for all those.

620
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:59,041
You should be grateful
that I left that gold tooth.

621
00:47:59,125 --> 00:47:59,916
You!

622
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,541
I will come there
and break your hand.

623
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,875
Will you break my hand? Wait...

624
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:06,750
Sheru, come out, Sheru.

625
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:27,208
He is quite far.
This punch will not reach him.

626
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:29,208
Shall I spit on him?

627
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:34,791
Now let me see whose hand will break.
Yours or mine.

628
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,291
I will see you later.

629
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,916
He... he threatened...

630
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,958
Let him... You are here.

631
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,958
Yes I am here.

632
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:53,500
What will this brave man drink?
Tea or coffee?

633
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:55,500
Whatever you make me drink.

634
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:57,458
Tell me your choice.

635
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:04,333
Do you give orders
only at night and not in the morning?

636
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,791
Then... it's tea.

637
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:11,541
-Shall I ask you something?
-Yes.

638
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:16,458
How did a girl get
trapped in Balram's plan?

639
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:18,083
Just as I got trapped with you.

640
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,250
In my trap?

641
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,875
You saved me from Balram and
Balram had saved me from someone else.

642
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:25,958
I saved you from Balram
and Balram from someone else...

643
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:27,458
Ok... in this way.

644
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:31,125
Don't you have a family?

645
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:34,208
I had a mother who was
a famous singer of Benaras.

646
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:37,333
She fell in love with a man
so she left work and came to Mumbai.

647
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:41,000
Great. She showed great intelligence.

648
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:44,750
Intelligence?
She showed absolutely stupidity.

649
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:47,833
She left her work for a
man and had to cry all her life.

650
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:49,708
That man used to make fake currency.

651
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:51,708
He escaped by duping the police.

652
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,916
My mother was arrested
and I was born in a jail.

653
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,916
-In a jail?
-Yes.

654
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:01,666
You suffered a lot.

655
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:08,875
Born in a jail...
and then this business.

656
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:12,583
All businesses are same.

657
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:15,375
All work is done to earn
living and to satisfy hunger.

658
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:20,416
But in other businesses
there is a benefit.

659
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,208
You do not find people
like Balram there.

660
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,708
Now I am not worried about that.

661
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:27,750
I have found a brave man
for my protection.

662
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:29,541
-Me?
-Yes.

663
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,958
Now what is the use
of this blue uniform?

664
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:34,041
I got it made from my own earnings.

665
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,125
How can I throw it away?

666
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:37,875
Don't throw it and
stay here with comfort.

667
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:40,083
I will earn and you enjoy.

668
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:43,041
Not at all.
I will never become a tamed lion.

669
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,208
I will never enjoy
on a woman's earnings.

670
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:48,208
What do you mean?
Will you leave me?

671
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,208
You want Balram to come
here and break my hand?

672
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:53,166
I will break his head. Let him come.

673
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,916
If you go away,
then he will surely come back.

674
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,916
Maybe...

675
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:04,916
How do I explain?
I do not like your business.

676
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,541
Do you like me? Tell me...

677
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:12,958
You... I do not like you smoking.

678
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:16,833
Do you like me now?

679
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,833
Tell me.

680
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,541
Last night you forced me
to be informal with you.

681
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:26,333
To be personal with you in every way.

682
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,916
Forgive me.

683
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,541
Why don't you understand?

684
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:31,375
Since morning I have
been addressing you formally...

685
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:33,958
and not even once have you stopped me.

686
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,708
Address me informally quickly.

687
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:41,166
Say it.

688
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:44,625
You...

689
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:50,208
Now you will not leave me.

690
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:52,250
I am not a loafer.

691
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:55,666
Till today, I have never been
so informal with anyone.

692
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:57,625
How can I leave you
without any support?

693
00:51:58,416 --> 00:51:59,666
My innocent one.

694
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,875
I feel this innocence
of yours will loot me.

695
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:08,000
Do you know...
people have accepted my soul

696
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,583
but not my heart?

697
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:27,500
I say that it has boiled.

698
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,708
Just forget about
destroying the place, sir.

699
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,750
There is no girl there.

700
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:40,583
Drink coffee and keep your mind cool.

701
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:44,583
I am fed up. It has been
so long but she has still not returned.

702
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:48,916
How will she earn if she returns soon?

703
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,708
Will you keep quiet?

704
00:52:51,791 --> 00:52:53,500
As you say, sir.

705
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,750
I do not like the way she earns.

706
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:58,250
I do not like this environment.

707
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:00,000
I do not know how I have been trapped.

708
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:01,041
There...

709
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:04,666
I feel like leaving everything
and going back to Nagpur.

710
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,083
Go. Surely go.

711
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:08,750
Go... any message for Nisha.

712
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:10,000
Yes.

713
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,083
Tell me.

714
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:12,916
-Tell her that...
-What?

715
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:14,583
-That...
-What?

716
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:17,666
Tell her that...

717
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,875
What do you think,
that I cannot leave Nisha and go?

718
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:23,666
Just give it a try. Just try it.

719
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:24,791
Sheru!

720
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:27,291
What happened?

721
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:32,250
He is very sad.
He was fluttering in your absence.

722
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,458
Ok. I will make him happy.

723
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:36,500
I tried to find it in many
shops and then I chose this.

724
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,125
-Do you like it?
-I do not want it.

725
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,208
Don't be so choosy.

726
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:43,041
Bulbul gave Mithu a cheap watch.

727
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:47,541
I bought a nice one for you. Take it.

728
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:50,916
-Thank you.
-Do you still want to go?

729
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,833
Yes, I will surely go.
I will take her along with me.

730
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:54,833
Where will you take me?
This is business time.

731
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:57,000
-To hell with your business.
-What?

732
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,666
He does not like to
be the owner of a taxi.

733
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:02,708
He wants a private car
that will always remain with him.

734
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,000
That Nawab does not often come...

735
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:08,625
otherwise I could have
stayed with Sheru six days a week.

736
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,625
-Which Nawab?
-He was very rich.

737
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:15,833
He used to be with me
every Sunday for 500 per week.

738
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,541
Rest of the six days,
I used to enjoy.

739
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,583
I used to watch movies,
two shows per day.

740
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:21,833
Where is he now?

741
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:25,916
He has not died but his wife has.

742
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:28,625
From that time,
Nawab stopped coming.

743
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,791
Come on girls, hurry up.
Victoria hall is full of men.

744
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:35,875
Ok I will go for my business now.

745
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:37,750
Where are you going?

746
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,208
-Hello.
-Thank you.

747
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,958
-Come on let's go.
-Bye.

748
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,541
You leave her and let her go.

749
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,916
Leave her.

750
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:33,708
Thank you, madam.

751
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,416
Stop! Stop!

752
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:06,500
Stop! Stop!

753
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,791
Look at your face.

754
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:31,625
You were trying to be the hero!

755
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,458
Look at your condition.

756
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:36,458
Any loafer having fun
with you in Mauj Hotel...

757
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:39,583
I cannot tolerate that.

758
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,541
You are a very jealous kind.

759
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,416
Why should you bother
if people have fun?

760
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,708
I do not have fun but do business.

761
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:48,833
Business? You do your business
and I will keep creating havoc.

762
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:51,375
You should be ashamed.

763
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:53,625
In this way, you will
destroy my business.

764
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:55,416
Both of us will be at loss!

765
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,958
I am waiting for the day to drown

766
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,750
in the sea of love in such a way

767
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,083
that we have a rebirth.

768
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:06,666
As husband and wife.

769
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:10,916
What? You want to marry me.

770
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:13,708
In every birth.

771
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:16,416
Oh God! What an innocent
man have I found.

772
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,291
You're really innocent!

773
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:20,666
Does anyone marry a whore?

774
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:22,208
Everyone can't do it.

775
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:25,125
You need to have a courageous
heart like that of a lion.

776
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:26,166
What do you mean?

777
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:30,250
You will find many men in this world
who can turn a woman into a whore.

778
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:33,958
But rarely can a person be courageous
enough to make a whore his wife.

779
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:35,541
You need to be courageous.

780
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,583
What are you saying?
Are you hungry?

781
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:41,083
I have become passionate...

782
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,291
I was a police officer.

783
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:46,500
I have seen that your business
cannot be destroyed by law.

784
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,208
That is why I will finish
it by getting married.

785
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,958
Will you marry all whores?

786
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:53,625
Hindu Court bill does not allow this.

787
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:55,125
I will just marry you.

788
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,708
By setting an example,
more courageous men will take this step.

789
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:01,250
-Towards me.
-Not towards you,

790
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,666
but towards
the ones who will remain.

791
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:07,000
By making them wives, we will
improve the life of those women.

792
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,333
A new society will be made.

793
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:09,666
This dialogue does
not have any meaning.

794
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,250
I have heard it many times.

795
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:15,458
five out of ten men talk
about improving our lives.

796
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,708
But they do something else.

797
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:20,666
I will do whatever I say.

798
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:22,958
I will release you
from this environment.

799
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:24,541
I shall make you the queen of my house.

800
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:26,791
I will work hard and earn my living.

801
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,041
Even if it is not enough.

802
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:31,375
I will serve you first and
then whatever remains will be mine.

803
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:38,458
You have started crying
because of happiness. Right?

804
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:41,708
I had no idea that your intentions...

805
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:46,375
are so cheap.

806
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:50,458
Cheap? Cheap...

807
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:53,958
Do you find these intentions cheap?

808
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,333
Absolutely.

809
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,875
Do you want to insult
me in the society?

810
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:01,208
If I let you earn then
what will other women think.

811
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:03,791
I cannot serve my man.

812
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:06,625
Do you want to insult me?

813
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:12,500
Calm down, calm down...
not you, but I will be insulted.

814
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:13,666
How will that happen?

815
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:17,416
I will take you away
from this environment...

816
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:19,083
and make you a wife
in a decent society.

817
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:20,750
To hell with your decent society.

818
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,958
Will you be insulted if you
marry a girl from that bad society?

819
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:30,541
Yes, I will be insulted a little.

820
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,041
But that is ok with me.

821
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,083
Why should you be insulted
even a little?

822
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:36,291
Everyone is a hypocrite
in this society.

823
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,375
Our society is the best.

824
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,000
Live with each other as you like.

825
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:42,000
Both of us are respected here.

826
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:44,125
I will earn as much as you say.

827
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:45,958
I will work double for you.

828
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,416
Enjoy as much as you want.

829
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:49,083
To hell with this enjoyment.

830
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,833
I am not so useless that I would need
to live on your earning.

831
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,750
Look, come with me on your
own otherwise I will kidnap you.

832
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,083
Come on, take me.

833
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:02,416
-Get up from here.
-Pick me up.

834
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,291
You could not even pick me up.

835
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:12,041
Nisha, come with
me willingly otherwise...

836
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:14,875
-Otherwise...
-Otherwise I will leave you and go.

837
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:17,958
-Where will you go?
-To hell.

838
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:19,208
Why are you worried about me?

839
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:20,125
Ok.

840
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:22,875
I will not worry about you.

841
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:25,041
Aren't you worried about me?

842
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:37,666
If I go then Balram will
come and break your hand.

843
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,291
Before breaking it,
he will twist it.

844
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:42,333
If I agree to what he says,
then he will not break.

845
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:45,250
You will agree with what
that fool says and not with me?

846
01:01:45,416 --> 01:01:50,041
He will just break my hand
but you want to destroy my business.

847
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:01,083
<i>My innocent one, do you know...</i>

848
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:05,541
<i>people have accepted my soul
but not my heart.</i>

849
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:07,583
<i>Now you will never leave me and go.</i>

850
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,041
So, you have come back.

851
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:21,458
I just came to tell you
to lock the door from inside.

852
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:24,791
I am going and will never return.

853
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:30,208
You will come.
You will surely come.

854
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:37,958
Tell me, how's the business?

855
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:44,000
The business is going on very well...

856
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:46,458
Thanks to high price and famine.

857
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,166
Cheating has really increased nowadays.

858
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:53,875
Bungalow owners and rich people
have become my client.

859
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,333
But I cannot find
a man who can be fooled.

860
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,083
I am ready to give 20 per hour.

861
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,041
But I am not able to find anyone.

862
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:04,541
Even for 20 per hour you are not able
to find a person in this poor country.

863
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:05,500
Strange.

864
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:07,375
The work is risky.

865
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:10,333
I do not want a weak
fellow but a strong one.

866
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:11,500
Just like your Balram.

867
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:15,375
Even if he is hurt a little,
it does not matter.

868
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,375
Have you opened
a mutton shop nowadays?

869
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:20,833
Don't be funny. Help me find a man.

870
01:03:20,916 --> 01:03:24,041
So that I can earn money.
Luck is on my side.

871
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:25,958
Do send a man either
tomorrow or day after.

872
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:28,250
I will try my best.
I have your address.

873
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,708
Very good, very good.

874
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,916
The ice cream seller is here.
I need a new one.

875
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:37,625
This man is mad.
He does not trust men. He is mad.

876
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:48,750
Welcome, welcome.
So early in the morning!

877
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:52,500
Last night I spoke
to Nisha about marriage.

878
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:53,583
You must have...

879
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:57,041
You hurt your head yesterday
so must have talked some nonsense.

880
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,000
Why don't you understand Dhoop Chhaon?

881
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,750
I want to make Nisha my
wife with all my heart.

882
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:02,791
My lawful wife.

883
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:04,416
Tell me one thing.

884
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:09,041
Would you want a person to
do something he is not capable of?

885
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,125
No, I would not want this.

886
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:15,041
As music has two parts,
similarly, a woman has two forms.

887
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:19,541
Nisha is such a nice whore then why do
you want her to become a useless wife.

888
01:04:19,625 --> 01:04:21,458
She is acceptable to
me in any form as a wife.

889
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:25,791
But I cannot tolerate her
going with different men every day.

890
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:28,375
Will you be happy if she
goes with one more other than you?

891
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I mean, if she meets
someone like that Nawab...

892
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,208
then she will leave other customers.

893
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,208
No, I don't want her
to do this business...

894
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:36,250
Nawab...

895
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,666
She can leave her business...

896
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,791
Dhoop Chhaon,
will you give me a loan of 500?

897
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,083
For what?

898
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,250
You will give me 500 and
and I will give it to Nisha.

899
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:52,666
Nisha will give it to me
and I will give it back to you.

900
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:55,625
What nonsense are you talking?

901
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:58,083
You are a duffer just like me.

902
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:02,541
-Just like music has two forms...
-Parts!

903
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,208
and... a woman has two forms.

904
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:06,416
Similarly this man will have two looks.

905
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:08,250
I will be Sheru as well as Nawab.

906
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:11,291
That means you will be the
agent as well as the customer.

907
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:12,291
Correct.

908
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,333
Even I had used this idea once.

909
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:17,333
I had taken an oil agency from Bhimsen.

910
01:05:17,416 --> 01:05:19,750
To set it up in the market
he used to buy his own oil.

911
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,166
I will hear the story some other time.

912
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:34,583
What is my name?

913
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:38,166
Nawab Balam Akhtar.

914
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:41,416
The same that Ashok Kumar had
in "Mere Mehboob".

915
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,500
-Correct.
-Ok.

916
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:45,750
But you are a rich man from Lucknow.

917
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:49,291
You are the son of a
fallen Mughal dynasty.

918
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,958
Speak Urdu correctly.

919
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:53,666
Don't worry.

920
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:55,666
I will speak correct Urdu.

921
01:05:55,875 --> 01:06:00,708
I have seen all Urdu movies
from "Mughal-e-Azam" to "Pakeeza".

922
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:04,250
I have also eaten mughlai
food in Irani's hotel.

923
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:08,291
You will have to speak
Urdu proverbs as well.

924
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:11,833
-Am I right?
-Absolutely right.

925
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:13,333
So speak...

926
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:22,791
That's nothing important?

927
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:26,416
Oh God!

928
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:27,583
What happened?

929
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:31,208
You have totally spoken
the wrong Urdu, Nawab.

930
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:35,291
Not <i>"soya"</i>
but <i>"suhe"</i>, which means direction.

931
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:37,166
"Falak" means sky.

932
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:39,166
<i>"Ufak"</i> means horizon.

933
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:43,750
There is a big difference in these words.

934
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,083
I will take care
of language over there.

935
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:48,666
First, give me my 500.

936
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:52,750
You mean to say, my 500.

937
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:54,416
Yes, yours.

938
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,833
Ok, bye.

939
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:59,875
Hey, wait sir.

940
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,708
First hide this blue eye,
otherwise the secret will be revealed.

941
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:11,083
Not <i>"shabbe khair"</i>,
but <i>"shabba khair"</i>.

942
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:13,375
<i>-Shabba...
-Khair.</i>

943
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,291
Goodbye.

944
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,291
Goodbye.

945
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:19,083
Goodbye.

946
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:20,625
Goodbye.

947
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:25,791
My friend, goodbye.

948
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:30,500
My friend, goodbye.

949
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:33,750
My friend, goodbye.

950
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:35,541
-Hello...
-Hello...

951
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:38,125
-Shall we go?
-Goodbye.

952
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:42,791
-Listen, uncle...
-Hello dear.

953
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,916
Do you have time?

954
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,458
Yes I have time. But I don't feel like it.

955
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:54,833
Can you tell me where
will I get <i>"paan-e-gubbara".</i>

956
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
-What?<i>
-Gubbara paan.</i>

957
01:07:57,416 --> 01:07:58,625
What's that?

958
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,041
Mughlai.

959
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:05,041
I mean, very delicate
and sweet just like you.

960
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:06,875
Then eat me.

961
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,333
I will not be able to refuse
so shall we go to the sleeping hotel?

962
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,958
Hotel never sleeps, it stays awake.

963
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:15,750
What is the deal?

964
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:22,333
I do not like to
do such deals on the roadside.

965
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:25,166
I have lots of money.

966
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:27,499
Then come on quickly. Let's go.

967
01:08:39,957 --> 01:08:42,290
-Good evening Nisha.
-Good evening.

968
01:08:42,374 --> 01:08:45,916
Lovely evenings...

969
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:50,541
This old man is still young at heart.

970
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:02,041
What is your name?

971
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:03,499
What?

972
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:04,915
What is your name?

973
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:09,999
-Nisha!
-Very nice.

974
01:09:10,082 --> 01:09:12,999
Your name is Nisha and
your body is intoxicating.

975
01:09:17,124 --> 01:09:19,916
Your Urdu is on another level.

976
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:24,249
Another level?
Qutb Minar is of another level!

977
01:09:24,374 --> 01:09:26,249
I just speak Urdu.

978
01:09:26,457 --> 01:09:33,249
Beware, I am Nawab Balam
Akhtar alias Mere Mehboob.

979
01:09:34,832 --> 01:09:36,207
You are a Nawab.

980
01:09:36,499 --> 01:09:40,582
I am not a common Nawab,
but one of a high class.

981
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:41,708
Really?

982
01:09:42,332 --> 01:09:47,332
Great. Nawab, I will
really make you happy.

983
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,916
If you don't mind then
shall I say something?

984
01:09:48,999 --> 01:09:51,499
Say whatever you wish to.
I will not feel bad.

985
01:09:51,582 --> 01:09:53,749
It would be better if
you do not remove your clothes.

986
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:55,833
Then nothing can happen.

987
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,666
Why did you get me here?

988
01:09:57,916 --> 01:10:01,333
What can I say? It is a long story.

989
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:04,625
The story of Hatim Tai.

990
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,250
The story of Alif Laila.

991
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:11,665
How will I become a lover
when you don't want to be one?

992
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,290
I was once...

993
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:15,750
I was...

994
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:18,416
I had become a lover once.

995
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,625
Before the making of <i>"Mughal-e-Azam".</i>

996
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:26,125
At that time,
my wife was Pakeeza.

997
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:28,250
-Your wife?
-Correct.

998
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:32,833
She was the shade and I was
the light of the Mughal Empire.

999
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:36,083
She was the pride and I was the honor.

1000
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:39,666
But my cook was very clever.

1001
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,791
-Your cook?
-Correct.

1002
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:46,791
There is a kitchen in our palace.

1003
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:50,040
Delicacies are cooked
there day and night.

1004
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:54,125
My wife loves to eat tasty food.

1005
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,040
Her fondness for
food increased so much...

1006
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:59,958
that she became
fond of that cook as well.

1007
01:11:00,916 --> 01:11:04,916
That means your wife and that cook...

1008
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:06,083
Correct.

1009
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:07,290
I don't believe it.

1010
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:12,541
The wife of such a
rich Nawab with a cook...

1011
01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:16,583
My dear, I saw it myself.

1012
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,625
Both were near the
food that was being cooked.

1013
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,666
My wife was enjoying the aroma of pulao

1014
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:27,708
and the cook was enjoying my wife's aroma.

1015
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:29,208
They should be ashamed.

1016
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:35,833
There was a time when my wife
was beautiful and I was handsome.

1017
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:42,041
Sometimes, in candle light
we used to play chess or rummy.

1018
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:43,916
Rummy... I also play rummy.

1019
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,916
Great. Then shall we start...

1020
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Shall we start?

1021
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:55,041
<i>Goya ke chunanche.</i>

1022
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:58,458
Shall we start?

1023
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:02,791
I don't mind till you pay
for the time I spend with you.

1024
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:06,625
Let's talk about seeing each other...

1025
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:10,250
I have met customers like you,
earlier as well.

1026
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:12,708
A rich man used to bring me here.

1027
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:16,791
He would play with my
lovely hair all night.

1028
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,291
He sometimes used to make two plaits,
sometimes a bun...

1029
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,291
Sometimes like this
and sometimes like that...

1030
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:26,166
Only hair and nothing else.

1031
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:29,000
He must be from the family of a barber.

1032
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,916
We are from the family of Mughals.

1033
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:36,833
Come on, deal the cards.

1034
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,708
Is your wife very beautiful?

1035
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:48,915
Very. Very beautiful and young as well.

1036
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:52,208
Actually I cannot blame her.

1037
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,916
Why not?

1038
01:12:54,541 --> 01:13:01,291
What can I say? Since 1857
the ancestral sword was getting rusted.

1039
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,041
I could not tolerate it.

1040
01:13:03,458 --> 01:13:09,040
In the other war, I took that
sword and attacked the enemies.

1041
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:13,708
From Bondila to Shangrila,
I killed many soldiers.

1042
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:16,250
Don't fool me Nawab!

1043
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:19,041
With a sword you fought
against soldiers with guns.

1044
01:13:19,208 --> 01:13:21,375
That was the mistake that I made.

1045
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:24,916
I had a sword and was
facing bullets...

1046
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,875
How long could I have stopped them.

1047
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:32,958
I was hit by the bullet on
the lower part and I became injured.

1048
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:37,083
You must have
lost your eye in the same battle?

1049
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:42,500
Not only the eye, but I lost
many things after being injured.

1050
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:47,458
From the time I have returned,
my wife has been unhappy.

1051
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:48,625
But why?

1052
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:52,541
I mean...

1053
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,666
I cannot keep her happy.

1054
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:06,000
That...

1055
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,416
<i>Goya ke...</i>

1056
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:11,333
<i>chunanche.</i>

1057
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:19,625
Uncle, I think these gamblers are not
leaving today. Ask them to leave.

1058
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:22,291
Do you want to keep the
hotel open the entire night?

1059
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,000
Why? What is the occasion?

1060
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:26,291
Today is the day of independence.

1061
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:27,375
Independence?

1062
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:30,833
But today is not 15th
August but 4th September.

1063
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:34,250
I got independence when my father died.

1064
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,666
But I shall narrate
that story some other day.

1065
01:14:37,916 --> 01:14:40,000
Rummy... I won again.

1066
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:45,416
Will you play more?
It is almost 3:00.

1067
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,500
3:00? I thought it was just 2:00.

1068
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:52,250
Actually I cannot
keep awake till 3:00.

1069
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,291
I used to keep awake before the war.

1070
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,665
Anyways, take this.

1071
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:03,165
500! So much money
just to play rummy.

1072
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:08,790
If I had brought all my money with me,
it would have been too heavy to carry.

1073
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:13,125
Regardless, money has no value to me.

1074
01:15:13,416 --> 01:15:15,083
When will you come
to Mumbai next time, Nawab?

1075
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:17,875
My dear, I come here every Sunday.

1076
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:21,750
So will we play <i>goya ke chunanche</i>
next Sunday as well.

1077
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:26,165
Of course we will.
We will do it every Sunday but till 2:00.

1078
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:28,540
Agreed. This would be great.

1079
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:30,208
Now my stupid fool will also agree.

1080
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:33,333
Stupid fellow.
Who is this stupid fellow?

1081
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:35,040
The one with whom I live.

1082
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:38,416
His name is Sheru but
lovingly I call him "stupid".

1083
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:43,333
Is your love true or fake?

1084
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:46,041
I have faked my love many times.

1085
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,500
That is why I know
this isn't fake.

1086
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:52,500
But I have never
had true love till now.

1087
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:54,958
So only God knows whether
it is true or not.

1088
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:58,791
So that means only God knows.

1089
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:01,665
So shall we get down?

1090
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,791
One minute. Where is my sandal?

1091
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:07,375
It must be somewhere around here.
So shall I leave?

1092
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:10,290
-So next week...
-Sure.

1093
01:16:10,583 --> 01:16:13,665
Sha--

1094
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,916
Bye, bye...

1095
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,165
My sandal.

1096
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:30,291
Give my greetings to the
beautiful girl in room number Nine,

1097
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:34,290
and then give her this sandal.

1098
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:35,958
Goodbye.

1099
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:39,875
Bye.

1100
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:41,958
Stupid fellow.

1101
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:02,291
Tell me Nawab,
how did you spend the time there?

1102
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:08,625
Nawab Buland Dukhtar
was too good in room number Nine.

1103
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,375
No doubt!

1104
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,500
Do you know the meaning of Dukhtar?

1105
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:13,915
No, I don't know.

1106
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,916
-It means, daughter.
-Daughter?

1107
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:17,375
Daughter.

1108
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:20,791
I had given you the
name of Balam Akhtar.

1109
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,208
-Akhtar?
-Yes, Akhtar.

1110
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:25,250
-Not Dukhtar.
-Not Dukhtar.

1111
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:28,333
I made a mistake. Oh no!

1112
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:34,583
Sheru, congratulations Sheru, all the
members have chosen you as the head.

1113
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:36,083
-Head?
-Yes!

1114
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:39,250
Thank you. Thank you...

1115
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:41,915
-Head of what?
-BDU.

1116
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,583
-BDU?
-Yes.

1117
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:45,165
Thank you.

1118
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:46,833
What is this BDU?

1119
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:49,208
Bombay Dalal Union.

1120
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:51,540
Bombay Dalal Union.

1121
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:56,666
Look Thingu, I will not be
able to shoulder this responsibility.

1122
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:59,500
Only a capable person
should be given this position.

1123
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:00,750
I agree...

1124
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:03,665
Sheru, today is a very happy day for us.

1125
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:06,375
Here you became the head
and there my life is settled.

1126
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,208
I changed my life without getting married.

1127
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:09,583
In hotel Mauj.

1128
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:12,166
Yes. I will have to go
every Sunday to change my life.

1129
01:18:12,416 --> 01:18:16,500
But don't be jealous.
He does not have fun but is a Nawab.

1130
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:19,040
He just has intentions. That's it.

1131
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,916
He can do that at home as well.

1132
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:24,250
What was the need to take you to a hotel?

1133
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:27,000
I have said the truth.
I swear on you Sheru.

1134
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:30,875
Now I will not take any other customer.
He is a real Nawab.

1135
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:34,165
He is rich and eats a
different kind of betel leaf.

1136
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:36,165
He talks high of Qutb Minar.

1137
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:41,583
Did that Nawab teach
you such high class Urdu?

1138
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,416
Yes. He belongs to a high class.

1139
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:48,958
His wife is also very lovable
and the cook also enjoys it.

1140
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:52,875
What nonsense?
Who is this stupid Nawab?

1141
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:57,750
Don't call him stupid.
He has used his Mughlai sword.

1142
01:18:57,958 --> 01:19:02,415
But he is very kind. He gave me 500!

1143
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:03,875
500?

1144
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:05,833
-And he will give it to me every week.
-Every week.

1145
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,541
Everyone!
Nisha has earned 500 rupees today.

1146
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:09,458
Come on...

1147
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,833
How did you get this 500 rupees, Nisha?

1148
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:15,708
What did you have to do? Tell me.

1149
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:17,208
-Speak.
-Tell us...

1150
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:18,791
Come on tell us.

1151
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:21,958
<i>Goya ke chunanche.</i>

1152
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:24,916
<i>Goya ke chunanche.</i>

1153
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:27,958
-Did he speak these two words together?
-Yes.

1154
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:29,666
<i>-Goya ke...</i>
-Hail.

1155
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,541
<i>-chunanche.</i>
-Hail.

1156
01:19:36,041 --> 01:19:40,250

01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:43,750

1165
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:19,541
<i>"Goya ke chunanche"</i>

1166
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:29,541
<i>"How sweet is this song"</i>

1167
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:34,000
<i>"Goya ke chunanche?"</i>

1168
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:38,290
<i>"How sweet is this song"</i>

1169
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,875
<i>"Goya ke chunanche?"</i>

1170
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:47,040
<i>"Goya ke chunanche"</i>

1171
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,958
<i>"Goya ke chunanche"</i>

1172
01:21:58,208 --> 01:22:02,540
<i>"I just speak your name
And I think only about you"</i>

1173
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:06,875
<i>"My eyes see only you"</i>

1174
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:11,375
<i>"I just speak your name
And I think only about you"</i>

1175
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:15,375
<i>"My eyes see only you"</i>

1176
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:19,833
<i>"I don't know why my heart
Has become crazy about you"</i>

1177
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,208
<i>"What to tell you the
Condition of my heart"</i>

1178
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:28,125

<i>"Goya ke chunanche"</i>

1196
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:33,083
It was real fun.

1197
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:35,166
It was such a sweet song.

1198
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,125
What entertainment?

1199
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:39,125
-Really nice. Everyone's happy.
-Yes.

1200
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:40,833
Now you can pay the bill.

1201
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:43,290
-Which bill?
-The party's bill.

1202
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:45,708
Will I pay for this party?

1203
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:48,166
Have you forgotten?
You are now the head here.

1204
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:49,833
So the party is from your side.

1205
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,708
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1206
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:53,375
The bill is of 230 rupees only.

1207
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:54,583
230?

1208
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:57,665
Other than eating, you have
to pay for the damage of property.

1209
01:24:57,791 --> 01:25:02,375
Two chairs, Three tables,
glass... give me the money.

1210
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,083
Take it.

1211
01:25:05,916 --> 01:25:07,041
Give the remaining.

1212
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,165
First, give me my 500!

1213
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:11,040
From where shall I give that now?

1214
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:14,165
Nawab, mortgage your royal palace.

1215
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:16,708
Don't play jokes on me
in such dangerous situations.

1216
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:19,583
That would be against your royalty so
it would be better if you rob a bank.

1217
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:21,875
I had once looted a bank in Patna.

1218
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:24,415
My father's bank. But I will
tell you that story some other time.

1219
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:25,916
Give me the money!

1220
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:27,958
I will pay back each penny of yours.

1221
01:25:28,125 --> 01:25:30,291
But you give me a loan of 500 again.

1222
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:33,541
I am sorry. I am not that stupid.

1223
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,540
Look, Dhoop Chhaon,
you do not understand.

1224
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,291
If I do not give 500
next week to Nisha,

1225
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:40,250
then she will start
her business again.

1226
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:44,333
Just do me a favor once more.

1227
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:50,165
Anyway, I will have to
help you to get my 500 back.

1228
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:53,915
But this time not from my
pocket but from my intelligence.

1229
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,666
I will write jimmy's address for you.

1230
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,916
May be you will be able
to get 500 per week from there.

1231
01:25:58,083 --> 01:25:59,415
Write here.

1232
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:04,416
Jimmy.

1233
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:29,083
I caught you!

1234
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:45,915
Good, very good...
Very good...

1235
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,833
Go...

1236
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:53,583
Very good...

1237
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:57,083
Good, very good...

1238
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:08,000
Good, very good Tommy.

1239
01:27:08,125 --> 01:27:09,458
Stop it Tommy.

1240
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:12,583
Stop it Tommy!

1241
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:16,750
Tommy, Tommy...

1242
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:21,041
Stop it Tommy!

1243
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:23,958
Stop it Tommy.

1244
01:27:24,541 --> 01:27:27,750
Tommy, Tommy...

1245
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:35,583
Why did you stop him?

1246
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,750
After so much difficulty my Tommy
has started acting like a guard dog!

1247
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:43,083
Sir, if he did not stop its action
then it would have been a problem for you.

1248
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:45,416
No bones were broken...

1249
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:48,500
You would have to go to the police station
if anything had happened to him.

1250
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:49,915
Ok, ok.

1251
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:50,833
-Ramu...
-Yes.

1252
01:27:50,916 --> 01:27:53,750
He must be tired so
go and get milk for him.

1253
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:59,415
I had asked that stupid fellow
to send someone strong, like Balram.

1254
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:01,333
The work is not for
a weak person like you.

1255
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:04,540
Sir, don't chuck me out of this job.

1256
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,500
I will never complain.

1257
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:09,500
Where else will I get
work for 20 rupees per hour?

1258
01:28:09,708 --> 01:28:12,665
And it is very important
for me to earn 500 per week.

1259
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:14,625
Take 100 for today.

1260
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:15,750
Thank you.

1261
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:20,708
Shall I ask you something?
Can't I train the dog during the day?

1262
01:28:20,791 --> 01:28:21,833
It can happen.

1263
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:24,791
How can it happen during the day?

1264
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,208
If these dogs are given
training during the day...

1265
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:30,750
then these dogs will
not spare his guests.

1266
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:34,040
Thieves come at night, so
training is to be given at night.

1267
01:28:34,583 --> 01:28:36,208
-Sir, milk...
-Give.

1268
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:13,958
Sheru, have you woken up?

1269
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:17,916
I am awake but cannot get up.

1270
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:19,250
Lazy fellow.

1271
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:22,041
We will enjoy for the entire week.

1272
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:23,958
Nawab will come on Sunday.

1273
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,083
-Let's go out somewhere.
-No.

1274
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:28,375
Then what will we do?

1275
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:31,708
Sleep. Let's sleep till next Sunday.

1276
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:34,958
Get up. You have already
slept for seven hours.

1277
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:36,875
Seven hours more.

1278
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:39,625
I was dreaming about you.

1279
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,916
Wait.

1280
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:44,541
I will show you such beauty
of mine that you will be excited.

1281
01:29:44,875 --> 01:29:45,791
Close your eyes.

1282
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:48,333
Thank you, thank you.

1283
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:50,625
I bought this especially for you.

1284
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,416
Let me wear it.
Do not peep.

1285
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,041
No, not at all.

1286
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:11,375
Sheru.

1287
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:13,333
Sheru.

1288
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:15,208
Sheru.

1289
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:16,625
Sheru!

1290
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,666
<i>"My lover eats betel leaf..."</i>

1291
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,416
<i>"My lover eats betel leaf"</i>

1292
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:26,500
Mr. Thingu you owe
me 30 rupees for this month.

1293
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:29,375
I will pay you. Let me trap someone.

1294
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:30,915
Got the one to trap.

1295
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,958
I am at your service, sir.
I will show you absolute beauties.

1296
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:39,416
Not an ordinary one but a special one.

1297
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:40,958
The one who goes to
office during the day.

1298
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:42,833
You take care of the
one who goes to office.

1299
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:44,250
I have not come here to open an office.

1300
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:50,040
Sir, tell me what you want.
I can give everything to you.

1301
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:51,500
Wow!

1302
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:55,291
If my wife gives birth to a son
come and perform for us then.

1303
01:30:58,416 --> 01:31:03,750
Dear, I came on Sunday as promised.

1304
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:07,000
Happy to meet you. Come on let's go.

1305
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:08,458
Come on.

1306
01:31:12,708 --> 01:31:16,208
Nawab, you look different today.

1307
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:19,250
Changed? Everything seems to be fine.

1308
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:21,665
Different in what sense?

1309
01:31:22,291 --> 01:31:25,125
The covering was on
another eye last time.

1310
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:29,415
In a hurry

1311
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,458
I covered the wrong eye.

1312
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:34,500
That is why I banged against that.

1313
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:39,000
Now you look more beautiful.

1314
01:31:39,083 --> 01:31:41,540
<i>-Goya ke...
-Chunanche.</i>

1315
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:51,750
Sister Lalita, who is this old man?

1316
01:31:51,833 --> 01:31:55,083
The Nawab who comes
every Sunday to meet Nisha.

1317
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:56,541
Every week.

1318
01:31:56,791 --> 01:32:01,458
Amazing. I had thought that
such old men come every month.

1319
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:03,000
Is everything fine in the palace?

1320
01:32:03,166 --> 01:32:05,458
No, nothing is fine.

1321
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:06,665
What?

1322
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:10,416
I thrashed the cook.

1323
01:32:11,166 --> 01:32:18,041
When I saw them in love under the
Chameli tree, I could not tolerate it.

1324
01:32:18,208 --> 01:32:22,583
I threw the cook out with his luggage.

1325
01:32:22,791 --> 01:32:23,833
And your wife?

1326
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,041
She was his belonging,
so, has gone with him.

1327
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:31,375
I divorced her immediately,<i>
chunanche</i>.

1328
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:33,290
Very bad.

1329
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:40,291
Is this good or bad? That
cook used to make delicious snacks.

1330
01:32:40,708 --> 01:32:42,750
I will not find another like him.

1331
01:32:42,916 --> 01:32:46,708
I mean you must be feeling
lonely in the palace.

1332
01:32:46,958 --> 01:32:49,915
Not at all.

1333
01:32:50,166 --> 01:32:54,833
Owls visit the seven
rooms of the palace at night.

1334
01:32:55,083 --> 01:32:56,250
Are there seven rooms in the palace?

1335
01:32:56,333 --> 01:32:57,750
In this palace...

1336
01:32:58,083 --> 01:33:00,415
other than that, there is
a palace in Barahdari, Pandrahdari...

1337
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:04,916
Chandani Chowk, Amavasya Chowk,
Kabutar Khana, Bater Khana...

1338
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:07,415
Oh God! Such a big palace.

1339
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:09,875
Correct...

1340
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:13,333
I have an idea to erase
your loneliness, Nawab.

1341
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:15,583
I will come and stay with you.

1342
01:33:15,875 --> 01:33:19,125
What? No, this is impossible.

1343
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:21,165
Absolutely impossible.

1344
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:22,625
But why?

1345
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:25,915
Don't you like me now?

1346
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:32,040
Like. I like you a lot in every way.

1347
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:36,750
My Palace in Lucknow
is open 24 hours for you.

1348
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,083
But...

1349
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,250
But what?

1350
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:44,083
I remembered your stupid friend.

1351
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:47,416
Would you want to leave him?

1352
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:52,250
He is not stupid anymore.
He has become very clever.

1353
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:57,000
Clever? Fast as a horse
or spicy like a chili?

1354
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:58,915
Just like the cook.

1355
01:33:59,208 --> 01:34:01,583
He is no more interested in me.

1356
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:05,000
He is always tired and irritated.

1357
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:10,040
There must be some
strong reason behind it.

1358
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:13,583
The reason can be delicate too.

1359
01:34:13,708 --> 01:34:15,915
Some sweet young girl...

1360
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,666
Impossible.

1361
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:21,750
He cannot get anyone
more delicate than you.

1362
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:26,165
Delicate body, mind and behavior.

1363
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:29,166
You are delicate all over.

1364
01:34:29,708 --> 01:34:35,665
There is no point in telling me all this.
Tell Sheru that I am delicate.

1365
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:36,583
-What?
-Yes.

1366
01:34:36,666 --> 01:34:38,583
-Shall I tell Sheru?
-Yes.

1367
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:40,165
Only then he will
know who I am.

1368
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:41,166
He is sitting in the cafe.

1369
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:42,375
-I will call him.
-No.

1370
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,208
I will go before you call him.

1371
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:46,208
Otherwise I will miss
my flight to Lucknow.

1372
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:48,208
But you had said that
you will wait till 2:00.

1373
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:52,000
Now how can I wait till two
when a third one is waiting for you?

1374
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:55,833
Listen, delicate beauty,
even my heart is delicate.

1375
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:58,625
I give my time to
Sheru for which I pay

1376
01:34:58,916 --> 01:35:03,250
Go. Today you will not
find him irritated but happy.

1377
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:04,500
<i>Chunanche.</i>

1378
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:08,915
You are a very kind and sweet man.

1379
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:13,250
Take this. <i>Goya ke chunanche.</i>

1380
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:15,458
I feel ashamed to take money from you.

1381
01:35:16,458 --> 01:35:18,915
I do nothing for you.

1382
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:23,915
You are not at fault
but the fault is of my sword.

1383
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:29,540
So, next Sunday, <i>goya ke chunanche.</i>

1384
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:31,833
Will you take my sandal today as well?

1385
01:35:33,416 --> 01:35:36,583
There is a stupid superstition
in our family and that is...

1386
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:41,208
to go with your lover
but do not leave together.

1387
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:42,875
One of them will fall sick.

1388
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:45,250
<i>-Chunanche.</i>
-Don't worry.

1389
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:47,750
I will leave after five minutes.

1390
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,750
Have a long life. Bye, take care.

1391
01:35:53,166 --> 01:35:54,000
Take care.

1392
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:01,708
"Why be afraid if you love?"

1393
01:36:01,791 --> 01:36:05,000
"Why be afraid if you love?"

1394
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:10,165
"You have loved not stolen anything"

1395
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:18,041
Stop.

1396
01:36:20,291 --> 01:36:22,083
This is a union court.

1397
01:36:22,166 --> 01:36:24,416
You fool. This is not a court.
This is a meeting.

1398
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,166
It's one and the same thing,
you buffalo!

1399
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:28,291
I mean, the verdict is passed there
and it will be passed here as well.

1400
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:29,166
What?

1401
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,625
Today we have to
decide that every girl...

1402
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:34,665
has to deposit her
one day earning in the union.

1403
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:36,625
-No.
-Stop!

1404
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:40,166
-Why don't you raise hands?
-No. We won't.

1405
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:43,625
This is the right of us men.
The decision has been made.

1406
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:45,833
How come? Where is the chairman?

1407
01:36:45,916 --> 01:36:49,541
I am here.
I second everyone's opinion.

1408
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:53,708
Heard that?
Come on. Out with the money.

1409
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:56,333
Come on. Come on.

1410
01:36:56,416 --> 01:36:58,166
I am here. I am here.

1411
01:36:58,333 --> 01:37:00,665
-I have come early, haven't I?
-You made me long.

1412
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:03,040
-But why early?
-For you.

1413
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:06,165
-As the Nawab is soft hearted.
-Really?

1414
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:07,458
Here.

1415
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,125
-Great.
-I am doomed.

1416
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:13,540
-How can you take it?
-For the union fund.

1417
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:15,625
You gave your opinion without
hearing the entire thing.

1418
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:18,500
I heard the entire thing.
I was right here.

1419
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:19,875
-Take it.
-Thank you.

1420
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:21,375
You gave him 500.

1421
01:37:21,458 --> 01:37:23,915
Yes, it was my idea.
As I am the chairman.

1422
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,833
You need to think about your stooges.

1423
01:37:25,916 --> 01:37:29,250
Sure. We'll spend
a week just like that.

1424
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:31,458
The Nawab will give
500 next week again.

1425
01:37:31,541 --> 01:37:34,416
Definitely,
If he doesn't get broken bones.

1426
01:37:34,583 --> 01:37:36,665
Who would dare to break his bones?

1427
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:38,333
He is a very big man.

1428
01:37:38,416 --> 01:37:40,666
And he has divorced his wife.

1429
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:43,833
Now I'll ask him to come twice a week.
We'll get a thousand.

1430
01:37:43,916 --> 01:37:46,250
Twice a week? No. Don't do that.

1431
01:37:46,416 --> 01:37:47,958
He'll be doomed.

1432
01:37:48,041 --> 01:37:51,375
Doomed?
Are you out of your mind?

1433
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:55,290
He has lost his mind. Why are
you making gestures like a puppet?

1434
01:37:56,708 --> 01:38:00,583
He is telling you wipe lipstick
from your right cheek.

1435
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:05,165
Lipstick? How did it come on my cheek?

1436
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:07,333
I want to know the same thing.

1437
01:38:08,458 --> 01:38:11,040
-Yes. You...
-Me what?

1438
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:14,208
-You must have.
-Exactly!

1439
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:16,083
No. I was with the Nawab.

1440
01:38:16,166 --> 01:38:19,083
-No. That didn't happen.
-Then what?

1441
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:22,333
-The meeting.
-It's over.

1442
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:24,375
Yes. The meeting.

1443
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:28,250
I was sharing my
knowledge in the meeting.

1444
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:31,665
Deep thoughts and all.
A girl couldn't control herself.

1445
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:34,750
-She lost control of her emotions.
-Exactly!

1446
01:38:34,833 --> 01:38:36,375
Really?

1447
01:38:36,458 --> 01:38:38,708
Let me see which
girl lost her control.

1448
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:42,416
So Sheru. Come.

1449
01:38:42,916 --> 01:38:44,666
What smashing music.

1450
01:38:49,208 --> 01:38:52,458
Lolita, look behind you.
You have dropped something.

1451
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:54,458
Me? Where?

1452
01:38:54,791 --> 01:38:55,916
There!

1453
01:39:08,458 --> 01:39:09,540
Score settled.

1454
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:11,458
Yes. Score settled.

1455
01:39:11,541 --> 01:39:13,083
Get up. Shake hands.

1456
01:39:26,916 --> 01:39:28,708
-Nisha will win.
-No. Lolita will win.

1457
01:39:28,791 --> 01:39:29,750
-Want to bet?
-It's on.

1458
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:31,250
-100 rupees?
-Yes.

1459
01:39:41,916 --> 01:39:43,291
Come on, Nisha.

1460
01:39:43,708 --> 01:39:44,915
Come on, Nisha.

1461
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:51,250
Get her.

1462
01:40:08,625 --> 01:40:12,250
Stop. Ok.
Knock it out! Peace.

1463
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:36,583
-How much is five plus six?
-Nine.

1464
01:40:36,666 --> 01:40:39,083
Nine, It's 11.

1465
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:55,458
Wow, Nisha.
She is spinning her like a top.

1466
01:40:55,958 --> 01:40:57,415
I am feeling dizzy.

1467
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:13,416
One... Two... Three... It's over.

1468
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,708
Out with the money.

1469
01:41:14,791 --> 01:41:16,875
Here's your money, you joker.

1470
01:41:17,583 --> 01:41:18,790
Three cheers for Nisha.

1471
01:41:18,875 --> 01:41:20,291
Hip-hip hurray.

1472
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:21,666
Hip-hip hurray.

1473
01:41:28,208 --> 01:41:31,125
12 plus three is 15.
15 rupees.

1474
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:33,790
Hey, bring Geeta to her senses.

1475
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:40,791
Oh God! I am done.

1476
01:41:41,916 --> 01:41:44,708
My body hurts.
I am doomed.

1477
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:46,750
Don't touch me.

1478
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:48,958
I am touching you with a bag.
Not my hands.

1479
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:50,290
I am just trying to help.

1480
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:54,083
Go and help the one whose lipstick
you had on your cheek.

1481
01:41:55,708 --> 01:41:59,625
I am thinking of resigning
from the post of the chairman.

1482
01:41:59,708 --> 01:42:02,415
Otherwise, the girl gang
will keep attacking me every day.

1483
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,166
How far can I avoid them?

1484
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:06,708
How dare any girl try to hit on you!

1485
01:42:06,958 --> 01:42:08,290
I'll make mincemeat out of her.

1486
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:11,583
But you stay away from Lolita. Got it?

1487
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:14,415
Ok. Who's Lolita?

1488
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,041
Don't act so innocent.

1489
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:19,625
As if you don't even know her name.

1490
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:25,500
I remember just one face
and one name all the time.

1491
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:26,583
Nisha.

1492
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,541
Liar.

1493
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:31,500
I swear. I've arrested many.

1494
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:35,458
But you've arrested me...
in a way which has no bail.

1495
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:45,458
Dear. Don't look at me
with those mesmerizing eyes.

1496
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:50,083
Or I'll commit a murder.

1497
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:54,375
See. I am getting goosebumps.

1498
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:56,208
So I have a cure for it as well.

1499
01:42:56,291 --> 01:43:01,791
Oh, God.
That fight has taken all of my energy!

1500
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,375
How about I sleep for a bit first?

1501
01:43:04,458 --> 01:43:06,625
Yes. That sounds good. Sleep.

1502
01:43:06,916 --> 01:43:09,083
-Should I sing a lullaby?
-You crook.

1503
01:43:13,916 --> 01:43:17,416
-You also sleep for a bit.
-Yes. I'll also sleep.

Let go. Let go.

1542
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:48,625
Let go. Let go.

1543
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:52,708
Let go. Let go. Stop. Stop.

1544
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:08,500
Sheru. What happened?

1545
01:49:08,666 --> 01:49:10,333
The day is about to break.
I have to reach home.

1546
01:49:10,416 --> 01:49:13,125
Why you are limping?

1547
01:49:13,291 --> 01:49:16,125
And this mark?
The same dog business.

1548
01:49:16,208 --> 01:49:18,083
-Yes.
-No. No.

1549
01:49:18,166 --> 01:49:20,041
Don't torture your body so much.

1550
01:49:20,166 --> 01:49:22,500
Quit that job.
Or you'll be finished one day.

1551
01:49:22,583 --> 01:49:25,875
I don't care. I have to
get Nisha out of this flesh trade.

1552
01:49:26,083 --> 01:49:29,833
I'll get her out of this trade.

1553
01:49:42,958 --> 01:49:43,833
Nisha.

1554
01:49:46,666 --> 01:49:48,583
You'll say that I am lying.

1555
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:51,166
But some friends came over last night.

1556
01:49:52,125 --> 01:49:56,125
I am telling the truth.
They took me forcibly.

1557
01:49:56,666 --> 01:49:58,416
I was about to wake you up.

1558
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,208
-But I thought...
-And...

1559
01:50:01,375 --> 01:50:06,500
We had drinks.
We danced... I lost track of time.

1560
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:08,083
Lolita.

1561
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,666
No. You misunderstand.
I was with my friends.

1562
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:15,958
Lolita.

1563
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:20,250
You are so distrusting.

1564
01:50:20,666 --> 01:50:22,458
We'll go the hotel tonight.

1565
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:25,375
Your misunderstanding
will be cleared there.

1566
01:50:26,291 --> 01:50:30,083
Lie. I yearn and long for you.

1567
01:50:30,375 --> 01:50:33,708
And you avoid me and go to that witch.

1568
01:50:33,791 --> 01:50:37,125
Trust me.
I have no connection with her.

1569
01:50:37,208 --> 01:50:39,625
You cheat.
Look at the nail marks on your neck.

1570
01:50:39,708 --> 01:50:41,250
You didn't even feel
her nails in the frenzy.

1571
01:50:41,333 --> 01:50:45,540
No. No. These are a dog's nails.

1572
01:50:45,875 --> 01:50:46,833
What rubbish!

1573
01:50:46,958 --> 01:50:48,625
Now I've understood why you avoid me.

1574
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:50,333
You spend every night with Lolita.

1575
01:50:50,416 --> 01:50:55,000
Wrong. I am really tired.

1576
01:50:55,166 --> 01:50:56,333
First, answer me.

1577
01:50:56,416 --> 01:50:58,666
What do I lack that
you had to go to that witch?

1578
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:02,041
No. No. I didn't go.

1579
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:03,500
You did go.

1580
01:51:03,583 --> 01:51:05,583
You leave me in the night
and visit her.

1581
01:51:05,666 --> 01:51:07,541
You have slept with her.

1582
01:51:07,708 --> 01:51:11,625
Ok fine.
I have. What are you going to do?

1583
01:51:17,833 --> 01:51:20,915
Leave. Out.
Go and live with your darling.

1584
01:51:23,666 --> 01:51:25,625
Leave. Instantly.

1585
01:51:31,125 --> 01:51:35,625
Leave me. I said leave me. Leave me.

1586
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:40,375
You always barked orders at me.

1587
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,541
Today, I'll order you.

1588
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,458
No. Don't come near me. Leave.

1589
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,666
You've longed for me, right?
Yearned me for me, isn't it?

1590
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,916
Leave me.

1591
01:51:56,208 --> 01:51:58,750
Now how do I leave you yearning?

1592
01:52:01,583 --> 01:52:04,708
I'll put an end to
your yearning today.

1593
01:52:04,875 --> 01:52:08,000
Oh, Lord!

1594
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:47,958
From your face, it seems like you
haven't eaten anything.

1595
01:52:48,166 --> 01:52:49,708
Here. Eat.

1596
01:52:53,833 --> 01:52:56,415
Here. Your 500 rupees.

1597
01:52:56,916 --> 01:52:59,125
How will you pay Nisha
next Sunday?

1598
01:52:59,416 --> 01:53:01,416
There is quite a
bit of life left in me.

1599
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:03,665
I'll become the
dog's target every day.

1600
01:53:04,875 --> 01:53:07,958
Keep it. Give it to me
when Nisha gives it to you.

1601
01:53:08,291 --> 01:53:09,833
I won't take money from Nisha.

1602
01:53:10,041 --> 01:53:10,875
Why?

1603
01:53:11,625 --> 01:53:14,333
Had a fight?
Did she throw you out of the house?

1604
01:53:14,833 --> 01:53:16,290
Did you have a disagreement?

1605
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:19,916
She hates me. I can bear that.

1606
01:53:20,041 --> 01:53:21,708
But, she becomes her own enemy...

1607
01:53:21,791 --> 01:53:23,125
I can't bear that.

1608
01:53:23,541 --> 01:53:25,458
She won't always be beautiful.

1609
01:53:25,541 --> 01:53:27,500
How long is she going
to continue this job?

1610
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:29,791
But I will save her.

1611
01:53:32,833 --> 01:53:33,708
Take it.

1612
01:53:33,916 --> 01:53:37,166
Keep it. Eat.

1613
01:53:38,416 --> 01:53:39,791
I'll pay this bill.

1614
01:53:39,916 --> 01:53:42,500
"Pay the bill."
You're a business tycoon, aren't you?

1615
01:53:42,833 --> 01:53:45,625
Our life was good.
There was peace in the community.

1616
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:48,250
Why did you come here?
To transform everyone?

1617
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:49,915
You've spoilt me as well.

1618
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,875
I have never fed anyone
for free till date.

1619
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:53,915
Eat this. Go down and sleep.

1620
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:57,833
-I need some water.
-I'll whack you.

1621
01:53:58,083 --> 01:53:59,000
I'll send it.

1622
01:54:10,166 --> 01:54:13,041
Aren't you the same Nawab
who comes to see Nisha...

1623
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:14,916
Any objection?

1624
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,750
Not at all. At one point, I had Nisha.

1625
01:54:18,958 --> 01:54:21,875
But I found a better girl.
So I threw her out.

1626
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:27,416
Your yellow tooth tells me
that you have a colorful chick.

1627
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:30,375
Who is it? A kite or a crow?

1628
01:54:31,083 --> 01:54:33,250
Fakhta. There she is.

1629
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,750
Try her.
Nisha pales in comparison to her.

1630
01:54:37,833 --> 01:54:41,958
I am sorry. I have diabetes.

1631
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:45,291
The doctor has advised
having only pale things.

1632
01:54:45,375 --> 01:54:46,875
Sir...

1633
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:49,666
See you.

1634
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,458
Is everything all right, my love?

1635
01:54:54,541 --> 01:54:56,458
There was yearning in your call.

1636
01:54:56,625 --> 01:55:00,166
I am really upset today.
I want to discuss something urgent.

1637
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:01,666
Sure.

1638
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:05,916
But where? On the street here...
or in your office?

1639
01:55:06,125 --> 01:55:07,958
-There. Let's go.
-Please.

1640
01:55:17,375 --> 01:55:21,916
Yes... tell me, my love.
What's your problem?

1641
01:55:22,083 --> 01:55:24,290
Will you do what you
said the other night?

1642
01:55:24,375 --> 01:55:25,708
Of course, I will.

1643
01:55:25,791 --> 01:55:27,708
What did I say
that I would do today?

1644
01:55:27,916 --> 01:55:31,083
That the doors of your
mansion are open for me 24/7.

1645
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:32,916
It wasn't from the
bottom of your heart.

1646
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,750
If I said it, it must have been
from the bottom of my heart.

1647
01:55:35,833 --> 01:55:38,250
But if you say so,
I must have said it.

1648
01:55:38,375 --> 01:55:40,125
So take me to Lucknow with you.

1649
01:55:40,208 --> 01:55:41,665
-Today itself.
-Ok.

1650
01:55:41,833 --> 01:55:45,708
-Won't you?
-Certainly, my love.

1651
01:55:45,958 --> 01:55:47,583
But think about it.

1652
01:55:48,041 --> 01:55:53,416
If you go away,
your stupid Sheru will be finished.

1653
01:55:53,583 --> 01:55:56,875
Sheru and Balram are all the same.

1654
01:55:56,958 --> 01:55:59,708
They're sweet at the start.
But then they show their true colors.

1655
01:55:59,958 --> 01:56:03,540
I'll show them.
I am no cheap girl.

1656
01:56:03,708 --> 01:56:04,625
I also have pride.

1657
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:10,125
Do show them. But my love,
they are from Mumbai.

1658
01:56:10,208 --> 01:56:13,333
How are you going to show
your pride and grandeur from Lucknow?

1659
01:56:13,625 --> 01:56:15,166
Don't hesitate.

1660
01:56:15,416 --> 01:56:17,583
Do you want to take me with you?
Tell me clearly.

1661
01:56:17,666 --> 01:56:22,000
There is no bush here to beat around.

1662
01:56:22,083 --> 01:56:24,458
Try to understand my signs.

1663
01:56:25,083 --> 01:56:29,165
How do I take a damsel
like you with me?

1664
01:56:29,416 --> 01:56:32,500
I am an old man.

1665
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:34,916
But you're not old at heart.

1666
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,666
Otherwise, why would you come to me?

1667
01:56:36,958 --> 01:56:40,500
You would play cards
with me in a club.

1668
01:56:40,791 --> 01:56:43,791
I know that you're
a colorful character.

1669
01:56:44,083 --> 01:56:48,165
Take me with you...
I'll be at your service.

1670
01:56:48,375 --> 01:56:49,916
I'll live there as your slave.

1671
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,458
Impossible!

1672
01:56:51,958 --> 01:56:55,333
The tradition of slaves is
only in the Arab region, my love.

1673
01:56:55,416 --> 01:56:57,458
It has been long abolished from India.

1674
01:56:57,541 --> 01:56:59,041
Then I'll become an Arabic slave.

1675
01:56:59,125 --> 01:57:00,875
-But...
-I don't want to hear anything else.

1676
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,833
-Come on. Sit.
-But--

1677
01:57:02,916 --> 01:57:04,833
Keep your mouth shut and lay down,

1678
01:57:04,916 --> 01:57:06,458
and close the only eye you have.

1679
01:57:06,541 --> 01:57:07,333
Why?

1680
01:57:07,416 --> 01:57:09,833
So that you can also
see the picture I take.

1681
01:57:09,916 --> 01:57:12,916
Take just pictures. Nothing else.

1682
01:57:13,083 --> 01:57:17,833
I'll turn your splendid
mansion into an Arabic palace.

1683
01:57:20,083 --> 01:57:25,458
I'll caress your feet with my hair...
and wake you up.

1684
01:57:26,625 --> 01:57:28,750
I'll always be at your service.

1685
01:57:29,458 --> 01:57:31,290
-And at night...
-At night?

1686
01:57:34,625 --> 01:57:36,416
There will be a market of beauty...

1687
01:57:37,458 --> 01:57:39,333
and there will be
lots of slaves there.

1688
01:57:39,958 --> 01:57:43,415
Silken bodies wrapped
in silken clothes.

1689
01:57:45,083 --> 01:57:47,290
In what dress would
you like to see me?

1690
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:53,500
Something where I see less
of the clothes and more of you.

1691
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:54,916
That will happen.

1692
01:57:55,541 --> 01:57:59,958
Beauty will be at its glory.
It will enamor you.

1693
01:58:01,416 --> 01:58:03,041
Some slaves will sing.

1694
01:59:10,208 --> 01:59:12,250
<i>"Ali"</i>

1695
01:59:19,083 --> 01:59:22,125
<i>"I am here"</i>

1696
01:59:22,250 --> 01:59:26,625
<i>"I'll take you with me

1697
01:59:27,833 --> 01:59:30,875

01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,375

1699
01:59:36,416 --> 01:59:40,541
<i>"No. I will not go with you"</i>

1700
01:59:40,625 --> 01:59:44,375
<i>"Holding your hand"</i>

1701
01:59:45,083 --> 01:59:49,208
<i>"No. I will not go with you"</i>

1702
01:59:49,291 --> 01:59:53,041
<i>"Holding your hand"</i>

1703
02:00:27,416 --> 02:00:32,250
<i>"Don't get upset
At the drop of a hat"</i>

1704
02:00:32,333 --> 02:00:38,250
<i>"Don't break promises
On a night like this"</i>

1705
02:00:38,791 --> 02:00:43,666
<i>"Don't get upset
At the drop of a hat"</i>

1706
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:49,458
<i>"Don't break promises
On a night like this"</i>

1707
02:00:50,125 --> 02:00:55,000
<i>"I've seen in a few meetings"</i>

1708
02:00:55,208 --> 02:01:00,333
<i>"You can't be trusted"</i>

1709
02:01:01,458 --> 02:01:06,333
<i>"I've seen in a few meetings"</i>

1710
02:01:06,541 --> 02:01:11,666
<i>"You can't be trusted"</i>

1711
02:01:52,458 --> 02:01:56,540
<i>"Don't reject me like that"</i>

1712
02:01:56,708 --> 02:02:00,958
<i>"I am an admirer of your name"</i>

1713
02:02:01,166 --> 02:02:05,250
<i>"Don't reject me like that"</i>

1714
02:02:05,416 --> 02:02:08,833
<i>"I am an admirer of your name"</i>

1715
02:02:09,791 --> 02:02:13,666
<i>"No. I will not go with you"</i>

1716
02:02:13,833 --> 02:02:17,750
<i>"Holding your hand"</i>

1717
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:21,291
<i>"I am here"</i>

1718
02:02:21,416 --> 02:02:25,791
<i>"I'll take you with me"</i>

1719
02:02:25,875 --> 02:02:30,000
<i>"Holding your hand"</i>

1720
02:02:56,625 --> 02:03:01,458
<i>"I agree that you're crazy for me"</i>

1721
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:07,416
<i>"You fall for every girl you see"</i>

1722
02:03:07,958 --> 02:03:12,750

1723
02:03:12,916 --> 02:03:18,666

And I am a stranger"</i>

1725

1731
02:04:38,958 --> 02:04:42,458
<i>"Cheaters and disloyal people like you
Are of no use to me"</i>

1732
02:04:42,833 --> 02:04:46,375
<i>"I am here"</i>

1733
02:04:46,541 --> 02:04:50,791
<i>"I'll take you with me
Holding your hand"</i>

1734
02:04:51,916 --> 02:04:55,791
<i>"No. I will not go with you"</i>

1735
02:04:55,958 --> 02:04:59,415
<i>"Holding your hand"</i>

1736
02:04:59,583 --> 02:05:03,083
<i>"Holding your hand"</i>

1737
02:06:03,750 --> 02:06:09,000
Spring is in my beard and in my car.

1738
02:06:17,458 --> 02:06:20,125
Your Highness,
when is your flight to Lucknow?

1739
02:06:20,375 --> 02:06:21,333
At 9:00.

1740
02:06:21,416 --> 02:06:23,000
Oh God. Let me rush home.

1741
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:26,500
I'll see you at Dhoop Chhaon's
Cafe at 8:00 with my luggage.

1742
02:06:26,583 --> 02:06:27,625
Listen...

1743
02:06:29,833 --> 02:06:31,583
I have to tell you something.

1744
02:06:34,583 --> 02:06:37,790
-I lied to you.
-I know you lied.

1745
02:06:38,541 --> 02:06:40,833
-You know?
-Very well.

1746
02:06:40,958 --> 02:06:44,750
You are neither impotent nor old.

1747
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,166
I see. Ok.

1748
02:06:47,375 --> 02:06:48,916
So see you at 8:00 in the cafe.

1749
02:06:50,458 --> 02:06:54,583
I was scared.
I thought she recognized me.

1750
02:06:56,333 --> 02:07:01,375
12 dozen Samosas,
three dozen cream roll and four dozen...

1751
02:07:01,458 --> 02:07:02,750
-Kurian.
-Yes.

1752
02:07:02,958 --> 02:07:03,875
Get a coffee.

1753
02:07:04,208 --> 02:07:05,040
Ok.

1754
02:07:05,125 --> 02:07:08,958
What brings you here so early
juggling walnuts, muscle man?

1755
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:12,125
Did that girl dupe you?

1756
02:07:12,208 --> 02:07:14,125
She was throwing
a lot of attitude at me.

1757
02:07:14,208 --> 02:07:16,083
I broke her hand last night.

1758
02:07:16,333 --> 02:07:18,375
I just admitted her to a hospital.

1759
02:07:18,458 --> 02:07:22,790
Where are you going to get
admitted after this? To an orphanage.

1760
02:07:23,333 --> 02:07:27,040
I am destined to be wealthy.

1761
02:07:27,458 --> 02:07:32,250
I'll earn money with my
tricks till I get a new chick.

1762
02:07:32,916 --> 02:07:33,958
You carry on.

1763
02:07:35,166 --> 02:07:37,791
Let me down a beer.

1764
02:07:45,041 --> 02:07:48,500
Your Highness, this is the limit. You
shouldn't have come here as the Nawab.

1765
02:07:48,583 --> 02:07:51,333
Darn, the Nawab.

1766
02:07:52,125 --> 02:07:54,041
Nisha is hell bent
on running away with him.

1767
02:07:54,125 --> 02:07:56,916
I feel like grabbing his
beard and making minced meat of him.

1768
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,833
Good Lord. It's the job
of chefs to make minced meat.

1769
02:08:00,916 --> 02:08:02,333
It doesn't suit your majesty.

1770
02:08:02,416 --> 02:08:04,625
She has fallen for this fake majesty.

1771
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Here a young lover is
risking his life for her...

1772
02:08:08,083 --> 02:08:11,875
and she has fallen for an old
man's gray beard and squinty eyes.

1773
02:08:12,041 --> 02:08:15,458
Today she was just magic,
She didn't take even a dime from me.

1774
02:08:15,541 --> 02:08:17,875
See... all the money I took with me.

1775
02:08:18,416 --> 02:08:19,666
I've got all the money back.

1776
02:08:22,375 --> 02:08:24,541
-Money.
-I see.

1777
02:08:24,875 --> 02:08:26,500
There was a time
when I too did the same.

1778
02:08:26,583 --> 02:08:29,540
I fell in love with a confectioner's
daughter in order to have free sweet.

1779
02:08:29,625 --> 02:08:32,083
Explosive love. At age nine.

1780
02:08:32,166 --> 02:08:33,833
Since then I've been this healthy...

1781
02:08:33,916 --> 02:08:35,541
but I'll tell you that
story some other time.

1782
02:08:35,625 --> 02:08:37,583
For now,
let's make the Nawab disappear.

1783
02:08:37,666 --> 02:08:39,375
No, that will not solve the problem.

1784
02:08:39,458 --> 02:08:41,540
Nisha will wait for him to return.

1785
02:08:41,625 --> 02:08:43,208
She'll keep dreaming about palaces.

1786
02:08:43,291 --> 02:08:45,125
And I'll be left stranded.

1787
02:08:47,625 --> 02:08:50,500
Yes, I have an idea.

1788
02:08:50,875 --> 02:08:53,166
Let's finish Nawab.

1789
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:55,250
Murder?

1790
02:08:56,166 --> 02:08:58,458
No. Suicide.

1791
02:08:58,791 --> 02:09:00,916
Longing for his lovely wife.

1792
02:09:01,083 --> 02:09:03,540
He will drown at a place where
even his dead body is not found...

1793
02:09:03,625 --> 02:09:06,708
and this stick and clothes
will be found floating for proof.

1794
02:09:07,375 --> 02:09:10,333
You're seeing the
Nawab for the last time.

1795
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:13,458
This grumpy old man is going to drown.

1796
02:09:13,541 --> 02:09:16,291
Goodbye. See you. Bye.

1797
02:09:16,375 --> 02:09:17,625
All at once.

1798
02:09:18,291 --> 02:09:22,125
Goodbye Nawab, R.I.P.
Rest in peace.

1799
02:09:24,583 --> 02:09:26,083
Where are you off to, muscle man?

1800
02:09:26,166 --> 02:09:28,208
To take advantage of my muscles.

1801
02:09:43,166 --> 02:09:45,083
<i>Where did the Nawab go?</i>

1802
02:10:53,166 --> 02:10:55,125
Balram, where are you off to?

1803
02:10:55,208 --> 02:10:58,000
Dhondu. Give me a match before you go.

1804
02:10:58,083 --> 02:11:00,290
Darn the match. Here.

1805
02:11:00,375 --> 02:11:02,875
You're nowhere to be seen these days.

1806
02:11:02,958 --> 02:11:04,915
-You smoke. Keep it...
-Ok.

1807
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I've reached.

1808
02:11:14,416 --> 02:11:19,166
Darn you, Nawab. Today I'll
put an end to all your affairs.

1809
02:11:47,875 --> 02:11:51,041
Die, Nawab. Go to hell.

1810
02:11:51,416 --> 02:11:53,458
Goodbye, mister.

1811
02:11:53,625 --> 02:11:55,625
Darn you.

1812
02:11:58,791 --> 02:12:01,375
You slime. You have tortured me a lot.

1813
02:12:01,458 --> 02:12:06,000
Goodbye. Go to hell. Good night.

1814
02:12:46,625 --> 02:12:48,083
Police. Constable.

1815
02:12:48,166 --> 02:12:50,083
Police. Constable.

1816
02:12:50,166 --> 02:12:52,416
Police. Constable.

1817
02:12:52,708 --> 02:12:54,790
I will go. I will go.

1818
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,208
-Don't argue with me anymore.
-Do go.

1819
02:12:57,666 --> 02:13:01,666
It's your insult to live as number two
where you once lived as number one.

1820
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:03,000
Who said that I am number two?

1821
02:13:03,083 --> 02:13:05,583
You said that Lolita
took Sheru from you.

1822
02:13:05,666 --> 02:13:06,750
Now she is number one.

1823
02:13:06,833 --> 02:13:08,415
I am number one.

1824
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:10,041
-Number two.
-Number one.

1825
02:13:10,125 --> 02:13:11,541
-Number two.
-Number one.

1826
02:13:11,625 --> 02:13:14,666
Incorrect. The girl who
can captivate the chairman...

1827
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:16,708
she is considered number one
in this community.

1828
02:13:16,791 --> 02:13:19,958
Is it? Then I'll prove
that I am number one.

1829
02:13:20,041 --> 02:13:24,583
Undoubtedly. You are number one
and you'll always be number one.

1830
02:13:24,666 --> 02:13:25,833
Heard that?

1831
02:13:26,333 --> 02:13:29,040
Yes... I did.

1832
02:13:31,416 --> 02:13:35,500
What is someone who
jumps in thoughtlessly?

1833
02:13:35,583 --> 02:13:39,083
-A fool.
-You know yourself so well.

1834
02:13:39,291 --> 02:13:42,041
I was playing a ruse
whereby she would've stayed.

1835
02:13:42,125 --> 02:13:45,166
But you've shot yourself in the foot.

1836
02:13:45,375 --> 02:13:47,666
-You were playing a ruse?
-Yes. Yes.

1837
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:49,458
You should've given me a hint.

1838
02:13:49,541 --> 02:13:54,166
Come, officer. You're here
with your army... is everything all right?

1839
02:13:54,333 --> 02:13:56,208
I have to arrest this man.

1840
02:13:56,333 --> 02:13:59,040
Me? What did I do?

1841
02:13:59,208 --> 02:14:00,665
Murder... of the Nawab.

1842
02:14:00,958 --> 02:14:03,625
No. What?

1843
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,625
This can't be true.
There has been no murder.

1844
02:14:08,708 --> 02:14:11,750
Shut up. We found his clothes
and stick floating on the water.

1845
02:14:11,833 --> 02:14:15,665
-Constable, arrest him.
-Wait. Not so fast.

1846
02:14:15,833 --> 02:14:19,208
How can you say he has been
murdered till you find the dead body?

1847
02:14:19,416 --> 02:14:20,625
The search for the dead body is on.

1848
02:14:20,875 --> 02:14:23,458
We have found an eye witness.

1849
02:14:23,541 --> 02:14:24,916
That witness must be talking rubbish.

1850
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,708
The motive needs
to be established too

1851
02:14:26,791 --> 02:14:28,416
as to why did the murder happen?

1852
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:30,041
Motive? Take out your wallet.

1853
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:31,541
Take it out.

1854
02:14:33,333 --> 02:14:35,250
With the motive to loot.
Here's the motive.

1855
02:14:35,500 --> 02:14:38,291
Madam, this is the Nawab's wallet,
isn't it?

1856
02:14:38,666 --> 02:14:39,500
Yes.

1857
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,375
-Arrest him.
-Hold on.

1858
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:46,708
The accused has every
right to have a...

1859
02:14:46,791 --> 02:14:48,833
consultation with
his lawyer in private.

1860
02:14:48,916 --> 02:14:51,750
Before your eyes,
but away from your ears.

1861
02:14:52,583 --> 02:14:54,250
But who is the lawyer here?

1862
02:14:54,583 --> 02:14:55,708
This servant.

1863
02:14:55,958 --> 02:14:58,958
I ruled the Lahore
court before the partition.

1864
02:14:59,041 --> 02:15:01,625
If I had been in Delhi, the
partition would've never happened.

1865
02:15:01,791 --> 02:15:03,458
Let's leave that topic
for some other time.

1866
02:15:03,541 --> 02:15:07,083
Come, young man.
Let's consult.

1867
02:15:07,791 --> 02:15:09,875
Look, don't try to cheat us,
Otherwise...

1868
02:15:09,958 --> 02:15:12,958
Trust me Inspector... Trust me.

1869
02:15:14,791 --> 02:15:16,458
What the hell is happening?

1870
02:15:16,791 --> 02:15:18,625
Accept the crime.

1871
02:15:18,875 --> 02:15:21,750
How? You know that I
haven't committed any crime.

1872
02:15:21,833 --> 02:15:23,415
Who's going to believe that?

1873
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:26,125
Now if you say that you're
the Nawab, then Nisha

1874
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:28,500
too will think you're
saying it to save your life.

1875
02:15:28,708 --> 02:15:30,458
She has always thought
of you as a brave man.

1876
02:15:30,750 --> 02:15:32,250
Now, do you want her
to think you're a coward?

1877
02:15:32,625 --> 02:15:33,791
So what do you want?

1878
02:15:33,875 --> 02:15:35,666
I should go to the gallows.

1879
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:38,000
Wrong again, accept the crime.

1880
02:15:38,083 --> 02:15:41,665
And show your bravery,
the secret door is back there...

1881
02:15:42,041 --> 02:15:46,291
Yes. But if I have to escape,
then why should I accept the crime?

1882
02:15:46,375 --> 02:15:48,250
So that Nisha accepts you.

1883
02:15:48,708 --> 02:15:51,040
Now let this modern day
Chanakya do his thing.

1884
02:15:51,250 --> 02:15:53,666
And when I wink, escape.

1885
02:15:56,166 --> 02:16:00,416
Officer, my client
accepts the murder charge.

1886
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,500
Really? So easily?

1887
02:16:03,583 --> 02:16:06,915
Sheru, why did you
do such a horrific thing?

1888
02:16:07,125 --> 02:16:10,375
Tell me... Tell me. What for?

1889
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:12,375
That's a million dollar question.

1890
02:16:12,666 --> 02:16:14,291
Why did this murder happen?

1891
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:18,708
For the 500 rupees in the purse? No.

1892
02:16:19,083 --> 02:16:23,208
If the Nawab had been alive
Sheru would get 500 every week.

1893
02:16:23,291 --> 02:16:25,458
Because the money
Nawab would give Nisha...

1894
02:16:25,541 --> 02:16:26,833
she would give it to Sheru.

1895
02:16:26,958 --> 02:16:29,250
But Sheru is not greedy for money.

1896
02:16:29,333 --> 02:16:32,040
But there is something
greater than money in his eyes.

1897
02:16:32,124 --> 02:16:34,790
And that is love.

1898
02:16:34,874 --> 02:16:39,583
This murder is for love.

1899
02:16:39,915 --> 02:16:44,749
Lovers have destroyed
rules and kingdoms for love.

1900
02:16:44,833 --> 02:16:48,124
But there are not many
who can destroy themselves.

1901
02:16:48,208 --> 02:16:50,791
It's Sheru after Majnu.

1902
02:16:50,958 --> 02:16:53,333
Majnu was nothing compared to Sheru.

1903
02:16:53,415 --> 02:16:55,124
Some Nawab married his lover...

1904
02:16:55,208 --> 02:16:56,916
and that useless man did nothing.

1905
02:16:56,999 --> 02:17:01,915
My brave Sheru leapt like a
lion and destroyed the enemy of love.

1906
02:17:03,415 --> 02:17:06,915
Today, Sheru is ready to embrace death.

1907
02:17:07,124 --> 02:17:10,374
So that the Nawab
does not embrace his Nisha.

1908
02:17:10,708 --> 02:17:15,291
Sheru will die, but
his love will live forever.

1909
02:17:15,499 --> 02:17:17,833
He will be discussed for
thousands of years.

1910
02:17:17,915 --> 02:17:22,374
Sheru's love will become immortal.

1911
02:17:23,915 --> 02:17:27,915
Sheru, do you really love me
as much as Dhoop said?

1912
02:17:27,999 --> 02:17:30,583
He has said nothing.
How would he know?

1913
02:17:30,665 --> 02:17:32,207
It's ten times more than this.

1914
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:33,624
And you?

1915
02:17:33,874 --> 02:17:36,665
Me too. Me too, Sheru.

1916
02:17:36,915 --> 02:17:39,124
Today I've understood my heart.

1917
02:17:39,333 --> 02:17:41,083
It beats only for you.

1918
02:17:41,165 --> 02:17:42,374
-Nisha.
-Sheru.

1919
02:17:42,458 --> 02:17:45,291
-Nisha.
-Sheru. Sheru.

1920
02:17:45,374 --> 02:17:48,208
Wipe your tears.

1921
02:17:48,874 --> 02:17:51,665
You acted quite brilliantly.
It was quite a powerful lecture.

1922
02:17:51,915 --> 02:17:53,165
Where did you learn all this?

1923
02:17:53,583 --> 02:17:55,874
I used to be a hero in silent movies.

1924
02:17:56,040 --> 02:17:58,082
I used to deliver such
explosive lines that...

1925
02:17:58,249 --> 02:17:59,665
but let's leave that
story for some other time.

1926
02:17:59,915 --> 02:18:01,040
Sheru.

1927
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,458
Sheru.

1928
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:04,540
Sheru.

1929
02:18:05,624 --> 02:18:07,915
The officer is waiting.

1930
02:18:10,333 --> 02:18:13,458
Get home quietly. I'll see you there.

1931
02:18:18,124 --> 02:18:19,915
Everyone, chase him.

1932
02:18:19,999 --> 02:18:23,665
Hurry up. Hurry up

1933
02:18:32,415 --> 02:18:36,165
Come on. Move it. Move it. Quick.

1934
02:18:36,708 --> 02:18:37,708
Get him.

1935
02:19:15,374 --> 02:19:17,540
Up there!
He entered through the window.

1936
02:19:18,458 --> 02:19:19,374
You managed to escape.

1937
02:19:19,458 --> 02:19:22,208
Not yet. They saw me
entering through the window.

1938
02:19:22,290 --> 02:19:25,374
They will surely come here.
Now, where do I hide you?

1939
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:26,540
In your heart.

1940
02:19:26,708 --> 02:19:28,833
Idiot. Your life is
in danger and you're joking.

1941
02:19:28,915 --> 02:19:29,790
Open the door.

1942
02:19:31,708 --> 02:19:34,166
They're here. Escape
through that window. Quick.

1943
02:19:34,249 --> 02:19:37,458
No. I... I'll hide here.

1944
02:19:37,624 --> 02:19:39,165
-Open the door.
-They'll check it first.

1945
02:19:39,249 --> 02:19:40,958
Let them.
But I'll hide here.

1946
02:19:41,415 --> 02:19:43,790
-Idiot.
-Open the door.

1947
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:46,624
Open the door.

1948
02:19:48,750 --> 02:19:49,583
-Pandu.
-Yes, sir?

1949
02:19:49,666 --> 02:19:50,500
Break it.

1950
02:19:51,791 --> 02:19:52,625
Move.

1951
02:19:59,958 --> 02:20:01,583
What are you doing here?

1952
02:20:01,791 --> 02:20:03,082
I came to rest here
for a couple of minutes.

1953
02:20:03,208 --> 02:20:04,416
A couple of minutes.

1954
02:20:04,583 --> 02:20:06,458
So why did you take
so long to open the door?

1955
02:20:06,541 --> 02:20:07,666
I was in the bathroom.

1956
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:09,375
Are you aware of the consequences
of hiding a criminal?

1957
02:20:09,458 --> 02:20:10,416
You'll also have to go to jail.

1958
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:12,791
Believe me. He is not here.

1959
02:20:15,958 --> 02:20:17,458
Hey... Search the house.

1960
02:20:33,958 --> 02:20:35,041
He is not here.

1961
02:20:36,708 --> 02:20:37,625
He is not here.

1962
02:20:38,375 --> 02:20:39,375
He is not here.

1963
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:48,583
He is not here.

1964
02:20:48,666 --> 02:20:49,750
He is not here.

1965
02:20:50,791 --> 02:20:52,125
-He is not here.
-He is not here.

1966
02:20:52,416 --> 02:20:53,957
-He is not here.
-He is not here.

1967
02:20:54,041 --> 02:20:55,416
-He is not here.
-He is not here.

1968
02:21:18,166 --> 02:21:19,457
He is not--

1969
02:21:32,916 --> 02:21:34,125
He is not here.

1970
02:21:34,916 --> 02:21:36,250
He is not here.

1971
02:21:36,583 --> 02:21:37,791
He is not here.

1972
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:48,416
He is not here.

1973
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:49,625
He is not here.

1974
02:21:51,166 --> 02:21:53,916
We searched thoroughly,
There is no one here.

1975
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,500
I had told you.

1976
02:21:56,041 --> 02:21:58,791
But I have seen him getting
into this apartment with my own eyes...

1977
02:21:58,875 --> 02:21:59,708
through this window.

1978
02:21:59,916 --> 02:22:04,207
He might have escaped through
the door when she was in the bathroom.

1979
02:22:04,458 --> 02:22:05,291
That's possible.

1980
02:22:05,458 --> 02:22:07,583
Let's go downstairs and check.

1981
02:22:07,916 --> 02:22:10,750
Come on. Come on.

1982
02:22:11,250 --> 02:22:13,083
Hey... Come on.

1983
02:22:15,250 --> 02:22:16,916
-Come on.
-Not here.

1984
02:22:32,291 --> 02:22:34,957
You? You've put me in deep trouble.

1985
02:22:38,375 --> 02:22:39,333
The murder spot?

1986
02:22:45,833 --> 02:22:47,458
Not here!

1987
02:23:01,291 --> 02:23:02,707
Where is Dhoop Chhaon?

1988
02:23:02,875 --> 02:23:03,833
Don't be angry sir.

1989
02:23:03,916 --> 02:23:06,125
The constable eats two
Samosas and two butter roll.

1990
02:23:06,208 --> 02:23:07,666
I'll get four Samosas
and four butter roll for you.

1991
02:23:07,750 --> 02:23:08,583
Shut up!

1992
02:23:09,291 --> 02:23:11,375
-Where is Dhoop Chhaon?
-How would I know?

1993
02:23:11,458 --> 02:23:17,291
Welcome! Welcome! Why are you yelling?

1994
02:23:17,375 --> 02:23:19,041
I have come to arrest you.

1995
02:23:19,125 --> 02:23:21,916
I am certain that you've
helped the accused escape.

1996
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,916
It's your doubt...

1997
02:23:24,041 --> 02:23:27,041
and no one has the cure for doubt,

1998
02:23:27,125 --> 02:23:29,416
but I have a way of saving myself.

1999
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:31,625
-Not just one. But two.
-What way?

2000
02:23:31,916 --> 02:23:35,375
The first, is that now I'll
have to get Sheru arrested,

2001
02:23:35,541 --> 02:23:36,916
or else you'll arrest me.

2002
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,791
Look, you have tricked me once.

2003
02:23:38,875 --> 02:23:40,125
I won't leave you this time.

2004
02:23:40,208 --> 02:23:42,541
For that,
here's the other method.

2005
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:45,791
Crisp new bills.

2006
02:23:45,875 --> 02:23:49,708
Five for you and two for you.

2007
02:23:49,833 --> 02:23:50,958
Keep it in your purse.

2008
02:23:51,666 --> 02:23:54,875
Ok. Now tell me where Sheru is.

2009
02:23:55,083 --> 02:23:57,291
-At the murder spot.
-Impossible.

2010
02:23:57,541 --> 02:24:00,500
No criminal would go
near that place so soon.

2011
02:24:00,583 --> 02:24:02,125
This is what people
think ordinarily.

2012
02:24:02,208 --> 02:24:04,458
That's why the intelligent
murderer hides there.

2013
02:24:04,541 --> 02:24:06,707
Use your brains for a change.

2014
02:24:07,250 --> 02:24:08,333
What if he is not there?

2015
02:24:08,416 --> 02:24:10,207
Then you can hang me.

2016
02:24:10,291 --> 02:24:12,332
Go...
You'll find him there.

2017
02:24:12,416 --> 02:24:13,791
-Ok.
-Go.

2018
02:24:16,708 --> 02:24:18,750
Boy, you've had it.

2019
02:24:58,958 --> 02:25:01,041
Sir... sir look at that.

2020
02:25:30,416 --> 02:25:34,541
Sir... This is the same Nawab.

2021
02:25:34,833 --> 02:25:39,416
Mr. Blue Uniform,
I'll make you see stars in the day...

2022
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:41,500
if you point a finger at me.

2023
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:45,083
But you were dead...
I mean, murdered!

2024
02:25:45,166 --> 02:25:46,750
I mean, wrong.

2025
02:25:46,833 --> 02:25:50,000
I had been to the depth
of the lake for a stroll.

2026
02:25:50,166 --> 02:25:52,750
I have a spicy lover in there as well.

2027
02:25:53,125 --> 02:25:54,375
Lover in the lake?

2028
02:25:54,458 --> 02:25:56,750
Correct. A mermaid.

2029
02:25:57,375 --> 02:26:02,000
I have the gift... taste it.

2030
02:26:04,708 --> 02:26:05,541
Commissioner sir.

2031
02:26:15,416 --> 02:26:19,457
Well, the murder case
proved to be a hoax. Isn't it?

2032
02:26:19,583 --> 02:26:21,791
Yes. We were influenced by a witness.

2033
02:26:21,875 --> 02:26:24,583
Shut up. Excuses later.

2034
02:26:24,750 --> 02:26:26,000
Take out your purse first.

2035
02:26:26,083 --> 02:26:27,708
-Sir?
-You too, constable.

2036
02:26:27,791 --> 02:26:28,707
Purse?

2037
02:26:30,291 --> 02:26:32,291
Purse. Quickly.

2038
02:26:33,541 --> 02:26:36,332
Both of you have been accused
of taking a bribe.

2039
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,625
But sir... this accusation is
absolutely wrong. Who leveled it?

2040
02:26:39,708 --> 02:26:43,958
Sorry. This is
method number three for my safety.

2041
02:26:44,125 --> 02:26:47,208
Hereafter, don't ever
mess with this awesome brain.

2042
02:26:53,166 --> 02:26:55,207
Sir, they have the same mark.
And the number is the same too.

2043
02:26:55,291 --> 02:26:58,916
Suspended! Both of you are suspended.

2044
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,916
-But sir...
-My Lord...

2045
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:01,916
Shut up.

2046
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:06,000
Police are for serving the people...
not to loot them.

2047
02:27:06,333 --> 02:27:08,791
Both of you are a disgrace
to the police department.

2048
02:27:11,416 --> 02:27:15,125
Which constable did this corrupt
inspector accuse of taking a bribe?

2049
02:27:15,333 --> 02:27:16,666
Constable Ratan.

2050
02:27:18,083 --> 02:27:19,208
Poor Ratan.

2051
02:27:29,166 --> 02:27:30,541
You're back, Sheru.

2052
02:27:32,583 --> 02:27:35,375
Not Sheru, Balram.

2053
02:27:35,833 --> 02:27:41,375
Your old lover is back
with only love in his heart.

2054
02:27:42,083 --> 02:27:43,500
Why have you come here?

2055
02:27:43,916 --> 02:27:48,416
I got rid of the trouble
in your life called Sheru...

2056
02:27:48,916 --> 02:27:53,416
and came back to
make it up to my darling.

2057
02:27:53,791 --> 02:27:56,707
That means you framed
Sheru as the witness.

2058
02:27:57,458 --> 02:28:01,916
You greedy man...
I hate the sight of you. Get lost.

2059
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:04,750
Don't be so cruel, my love.

2060
02:28:05,375 --> 02:28:07,833
I regretted deeply after losing you.

2061
02:28:08,333 --> 02:28:12,500
I yearned a lot for you.
Hereafter I'll dance to your tunes.

2062
02:28:13,375 --> 02:28:15,250
Give me a chance, my dear.

2063
02:28:15,875 --> 02:28:19,250
I'll serve you 24/7

2064
02:28:26,875 --> 02:28:30,958
For your disloyalty.
I will break your hand today.

2065
02:28:31,750 --> 02:28:32,583
Come on.

2066
02:28:33,208 --> 02:28:36,166
I have a wealthy client
waiting at Dhoop Chhaon Cafe.

2067
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:37,250
Get back to work...

2068
02:28:37,333 --> 02:28:39,791
-Earn some money.
-You'll break my arm!

2069
02:28:39,875 --> 02:28:41,750
If the rest of your body
is fine then you'll earn...

2070
02:28:41,833 --> 02:28:44,333
more than others
even if you're a handicap.

2071
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:45,875
Come on.

2072
02:28:46,291 --> 02:28:48,750
Leave my hand.
I'll come... I'll come.

2073
02:28:56,583 --> 02:28:57,583
Come on.

2074
02:29:01,125 --> 02:29:02,083
Get up.

2075
02:29:04,916 --> 02:29:06,082
Come on.

2076
02:29:14,291 --> 02:29:15,166
Die.

2077
02:29:36,166 --> 02:29:37,457
Accused Nisha.

2078
02:29:37,833 --> 02:29:40,833
Before passing the judgment,
the court wants to know...

2079
02:29:41,166 --> 02:29:44,250
if you regret breaking Balram's arm.

2080
02:29:44,458 --> 02:29:49,500
Yes. I regret deeply...
Only one of his hands broke.

2081
02:29:49,791 --> 02:29:53,082
I would've distributed sweets among
everyone if both his hands had broken.

2082
02:29:53,166 --> 02:29:55,875
-You too.
-What?

2083
02:29:56,083 --> 02:29:59,125
Yes. He used to boss everyone.

2084
02:29:59,291 --> 02:30:01,207
He would threaten to break your hand.

2085
02:30:01,291 --> 02:30:05,332
Now tell me, handicap.
Who is a handicap now? You or me.

2086
02:30:05,833 --> 02:30:07,041
Order. Order.

2087
02:30:07,625 --> 02:30:12,125
Accused Nisha,
you're sentenced to nine months jail.

2088
02:30:13,291 --> 02:30:15,125
-Nisha.
-Nine months.

2089
02:30:15,208 --> 02:30:18,708
Did you hear? Nine months.
This means I have done something huge.

2090
02:30:18,791 --> 02:30:20,625
Go tell the entire community.

2091
02:30:21,666 --> 02:30:25,332
Sheru. Thank you. Thank you.

2092
02:30:27,666 --> 02:30:28,500
Nisha.

2093
02:30:29,458 --> 02:30:30,291
Nisha.

2094
02:30:30,541 --> 02:30:35,416
Don't cry.
Be strong... Here, wipe these tears.

2095
02:30:35,583 --> 02:30:36,500
Here.

2096
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,125
My world's coming crashing down.

2097
02:30:39,291 --> 02:30:41,375
How will I live without
you for nine months?

2098
02:30:41,458 --> 02:30:43,916
Ask Dhoopu to give you money.

2099
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,625
I'll repay it once I return.

2100
02:30:45,708 --> 02:30:49,250
And eat on time...
and take care of your health.

2101
02:30:49,375 --> 02:30:50,333
Come on.

2102
02:30:51,208 --> 02:30:53,958
I am not worried about myself.
I am worried about you.

2103
02:30:54,291 --> 02:30:56,707
Such a long punishment
and your delicate body.

2104
02:30:56,916 --> 02:30:57,791
How will it bear it?

2105
02:30:58,375 --> 02:31:01,375
It will be fun... I'll get a change.

2106
02:31:01,541 --> 02:31:04,666
-Don't forget. I was born in a jail.
-Come on.

2107
02:31:04,750 --> 02:31:06,041
-Sheru.
-Nisha.

2108
02:31:06,125 --> 02:31:07,500
Dhoopu. Sheru.

2109
02:31:07,583 --> 02:31:08,791
-Nisha.
-Sheru.

2110
02:31:08,958 --> 02:31:10,958
-Nisha.
-Take care.

2111
02:31:11,041 --> 02:31:11,957
Nisha.

2112
02:31:12,833 --> 02:31:13,666
Nisha.

2113
02:31:13,875 --> 02:31:16,250
No. No.

2114
02:31:40,041 --> 02:31:40,957
Nisha.

2115
02:31:44,958 --> 02:31:45,958
Nisha. No.

2116
02:31:46,250 --> 02:31:47,375
Don't look away.

2117
02:31:47,875 --> 02:31:51,583
You're extremely beautiful. So pure.

2118
02:31:51,875 --> 02:31:54,125
-Don't flatter me.
-I swear.

2119
02:31:54,666 --> 02:31:56,832
When you can see
a mother in a woman...

2120
02:31:57,041 --> 02:31:59,666
there is no purer form
than that in the world.

2121
02:32:00,333 --> 02:32:02,250
I wonder when I'll become a mother.

2122
02:32:02,333 --> 02:32:05,791
How far do I endure? I am fed up.

2123
02:32:05,875 --> 02:32:11,750
Why? Isn't your maternal family
taking proper care of you?

2124
02:32:11,833 --> 02:32:13,250
To hell with this maternal place.

2125
02:32:13,625 --> 02:32:17,416
When I wanted to eat sour things
they didn't even give me a tamarind.

2126
02:32:17,875 --> 02:32:21,625
These days when I ask for
fruits they give me eggplant.

2127
02:32:21,708 --> 02:32:24,083
Have patience.

2128
02:32:24,166 --> 02:32:27,875
Your mother too survived on eggplant
and gave birth to a girl like you.

2129
02:32:27,958 --> 02:32:29,083
You will too.

2130
02:32:29,250 --> 02:32:32,375
What if it's a boy?

2131
02:32:32,625 --> 02:32:37,500
No chance. The jail's history
is repeating itself.

2132
02:32:38,083 --> 02:32:39,625
It will be a girl for sure.

2133
02:32:40,958 --> 02:32:44,125
I too want a girl.

2134
02:32:44,958 --> 02:32:47,000
A little doll.

2135
02:32:48,458 --> 02:32:50,666
I'll make plaits with her hair.

2136
02:32:52,125 --> 02:32:55,166
I'll adorn her forehead with the dot.

2137
02:32:55,250 --> 02:32:59,583
And I'll carry her on my shoulders.

2138
02:32:59,666 --> 02:33:01,916
You wouldn't have to.

2139
02:33:02,291 --> 02:33:05,332
She has already started walking.

2140
02:33:06,333 --> 02:33:07,958
-Already?
-Yes.

2141
02:33:08,666 --> 02:33:11,666
She runs here and there at times.

2142
02:33:12,166 --> 02:33:14,041
My girl is very quick.

2143
02:33:15,333 --> 02:33:17,333
She seems to be spry like her mother.

2144
02:33:17,958 --> 02:33:20,708
She too will grow up
and come to this place.

2145
02:33:20,875 --> 02:33:24,000
No. I'll keep her far
away from a place like this.

2146
02:33:24,083 --> 02:33:25,125
How are you going to stop her?

2147
02:33:25,625 --> 02:33:29,416
The custom of our community is
that a woman should be a man's prey.

2148
02:33:29,833 --> 02:33:33,750
As soon as she grows a
greedy man will take her from you...

2149
02:33:33,958 --> 02:33:35,416
make her a means of earning money.

2150
02:33:35,500 --> 02:33:38,000
I will never let that happen. Never.

2151
02:33:38,083 --> 02:33:39,958
You're unable to protect yourself.

2152
02:33:40,041 --> 02:33:41,916
How are you going
to protect your daughter?

2153
02:33:42,291 --> 02:33:44,541
Demons like Balram would loot her.

2154
02:33:44,666 --> 02:33:46,332
They will compel her.

2155
02:33:46,416 --> 02:33:48,166
Some evil man would
want to break her hand.

2156
02:33:48,250 --> 02:33:49,708
Someone would try to shame her.

2157
02:33:49,791 --> 02:33:55,375
Oh Lord, how do I
save my daughter? How?

2158
02:33:56,166 --> 02:34:00,791
You didn't have a father,
hence you fell prey to cruel men.

2159
02:34:01,041 --> 02:34:02,666
Now you want your daughter
to meet the same fate,

2160
02:34:02,833 --> 02:34:04,666
long for her father's love?

2161
02:34:05,041 --> 02:34:06,625
Instead of ruling in a decent family...

2162
02:34:06,750 --> 02:34:08,791
she gets pushed into flesh trade.

2163
02:34:08,875 --> 02:34:09,916
No. No.

2164
02:34:10,083 --> 02:34:15,208
Nisha, if you wish well for
your daughter then marry her father.

2165
02:34:15,541 --> 02:34:17,416
Her future is in your hands.

2166
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:21,333
You can give her a father's house
or a brothel, it's your wish.

2167
02:34:21,416 --> 02:34:25,000
I will give her a father's house.

2168
02:34:25,708 --> 02:34:28,208
I'll do everything for my daughter.

2169
02:34:28,916 --> 02:34:34,666
I'll... I'll even marry her father.

2170
02:34:34,750 --> 02:34:40,083
Really? Nisha,
I was dying to hear this.

2171
02:34:40,375 --> 02:34:42,916
I know you love me immensely.

2172
02:34:43,625 --> 02:34:47,625
I wish you had been her father.

2173
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:49,083
What?

2174
02:34:49,750 --> 02:34:51,458
Who is her father?

2175
02:34:52,125 --> 02:34:55,208
Him... The one who ate
the special paan.

2176
02:34:55,375 --> 02:34:57,625
He impregnated me.

2177
02:34:58,458 --> 02:35:02,083
Him. Forget that old man.

2178
02:35:02,166 --> 02:35:03,875
I am ready to marry you.

2179
02:35:03,958 --> 02:35:06,791
I have come to know
that the Nawab is alive.

2180
02:35:07,041 --> 02:35:10,082
How do I give my daughter a stepfather
while her real father is alive?

2181
02:35:10,333 --> 02:35:15,000
Don't worry, I'll give your
daughter the love of both the fathers.

2182
02:35:15,208 --> 02:35:18,500
Don't insist... you have opened my eyes.

2183
02:35:18,583 --> 02:35:20,166
Now don't mislead me.

2184
02:35:20,375 --> 02:35:23,416
Don't take her real
father from my daughter.

2185
02:35:23,500 --> 02:35:25,166
Her real father is...

2186
02:35:25,833 --> 02:35:28,333
You're right...
How can I take him away?

2187
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:29,625
That would be a grave sin. Isn't it?

2188
02:35:29,708 --> 02:35:31,208
-Yes, Sheru.
-Mister.

2189
02:35:32,916 --> 02:35:34,500
Are you her family?

2190
02:35:34,666 --> 02:35:39,625
No I am not. That bearded
guy will become her family.

2191
02:35:39,791 --> 02:35:41,500
Inform her family.

2192
02:35:41,708 --> 02:35:43,583
A month of her punishment
has been waivered.

2193
02:35:43,791 --> 02:35:45,250
She can go home tomorrow.

2194
02:35:47,375 --> 02:35:49,083
Nisha... congratulations.

2195
02:35:49,250 --> 02:35:52,041
Now you can become her father's
wife before your daughter's birth.

2196
02:35:52,333 --> 02:35:55,166
Sheru, what about you?

2197
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:57,583
Me?

2198
02:35:58,416 --> 02:36:01,166
I'll spend the rest
of my life...

2199
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:04,958
in and around Nagpur with
your memory in my heart.

2200
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,333
Nisha, this is our final meeting.

2201
02:36:10,958 --> 02:36:12,333
Send me off with a smile.

2202
02:36:12,500 --> 02:36:14,791
-Sheru.
-Nisha.

2203
02:36:15,958 --> 02:36:17,125
Please, Nisha.

2204
02:36:17,833 --> 02:36:24,333
I'll go far away from your life with
your smiling face etched in my memory.

2205
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,666
Smile. Smile.

2206
02:36:28,166 --> 02:36:31,582
How do I smile? How can I?

2207
02:36:32,208 --> 02:36:34,416
How do I say goodbye?

2208
02:36:35,458 --> 02:36:37,166
My heart bleeds.

2209
02:36:39,958 --> 02:36:43,500
Sheru. Sheru.

2210
02:36:43,583 --> 02:36:46,791
Sheru. Sheru.

2211
02:36:55,291 --> 02:36:58,375
Come on, hurry up!

2212
02:36:58,791 --> 02:37:00,625
It's done. It's done. Come on.

2213
02:37:14,958 --> 02:37:16,041
-Nisha.
-Nisha.

2214
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:18,875
-Nisha.
-So sweet.

2215
02:37:19,166 --> 02:37:21,707
-Nisha.
-So sweet.

2216
02:37:22,583 --> 02:37:24,583
Why are all of you in white clothes?

2217
02:37:24,750 --> 02:37:26,916
Dhoopu said it's
a really sacred custom.

2218
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,541
Loudness is not allowed there.

2219
02:37:28,625 --> 02:37:31,250
So we took a shower
and wore sacred clothes.

2220
02:37:31,333 --> 02:37:32,291
What custom?

2221
02:37:32,375 --> 02:37:33,416
We'll show you.

2222
02:37:33,583 --> 02:37:34,750
-Come.
-Where is Sheru?

2223
02:37:34,833 --> 02:37:37,125
He informed Dhoop Chhaon and left.

2224
02:37:37,333 --> 02:37:39,208
He left... my Sheru left.

2225
02:37:39,291 --> 02:37:41,125
-Where?
-To the Himalayas.

2226
02:37:41,291 --> 02:37:42,291
In order to renounce the world.

2227
02:37:42,541 --> 02:37:44,375
Oh my God! Come on.

2228
02:37:44,458 --> 02:37:45,458
Driver. Come on.

2229
02:37:45,541 --> 02:37:46,957
Come on. Drive. Quick. Quick.

2230
02:38:12,125 --> 02:38:13,250
Highness.

2231
02:38:13,958 --> 02:38:16,041
Can you marry according
to this custom?

2232
02:38:16,333 --> 02:38:17,208
Why not?

2233
02:38:17,666 --> 02:38:23,666
The Mughal Akbar married
Jodha in the Hindu way.

2234
02:38:23,750 --> 02:38:27,416
-I am also a Mughal.
-Correct.

2235
02:38:31,666 --> 02:38:33,166
What happened?
It's an auspicious occasion.

2236
02:38:33,250 --> 02:38:34,083
Cover your head.

2237
02:38:34,625 --> 02:38:36,041
Oh, my God.

2238
02:38:48,458 --> 02:38:51,041
No. This marriage cannot happen.

2239
02:38:51,708 --> 02:38:53,375
You're not a real priest, Dhoopu.

2240
02:38:53,583 --> 02:38:55,291
How would you know how
to solemnize a marriage?

2241
02:38:55,375 --> 02:38:59,333
Silly girl.
I've solemnized lots of marriages.

2242
02:38:59,458 --> 02:39:02,916
From kings to their pets.

2243
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,416
But let's leave that
story for some other time.

2244
02:39:04,500 --> 02:39:05,333
Correct.

2245
02:39:05,583 --> 02:39:07,666
Now finish this story quickly.

2246
02:39:08,708 --> 02:39:12,125
It's an auspicious occasion.
Why delay a good deed?

2247
02:39:12,208 --> 02:39:13,458
Give me the garlands.

2248
02:39:13,625 --> 02:39:15,625
Here you go.

2249
02:39:17,541 --> 02:39:21,457
Here you go, Your Highness.

2250
02:39:26,916 --> 02:39:32,832
I am expecting it to tickle my neck.

2251
02:39:33,083 --> 02:39:37,458
No. I cannot forget Sheru...
not till my last breath.

2252
02:39:37,625 --> 02:39:41,250
Don't go by my gray beard.

2253
02:39:41,583 --> 02:39:43,958
I am no less than Sheru.

2254
02:39:44,750 --> 02:39:45,958
I will not--

2255
02:39:52,625 --> 02:39:55,666
-Sheru, you.
-Yes! Constable Ratan.

2256
02:39:55,833 --> 02:39:57,750
I got my job back for honesty...

2257
02:39:57,833 --> 02:39:58,875
with a batch.

2258
02:40:09,166 --> 02:40:12,916
Sheru! Sheru!

2259
02:40:13,625 --> 02:40:15,208
Sheru. Sheru.

2260
02:40:28,875 --> 02:40:30,583
-Porter.
-Porter.

2261
02:40:30,750 --> 02:40:32,166
Here... take this.

2262
02:40:32,958 --> 02:40:36,166
You spoke so well in the train...

2263
02:40:36,250 --> 02:40:38,375
about some stuff.

2264
02:40:38,458 --> 02:40:40,000
-Entertainment!
-Entertainment.

2265
02:40:40,083 --> 02:40:41,750
Give me a way of entertaining myself?

2266
02:40:41,833 --> 02:40:45,625
Why do you need a way?
You have such a nice wife.

2267
02:40:45,708 --> 02:40:47,708
She is old stuff now.

2268
02:40:47,791 --> 02:40:50,041
When I return from Jamshedpur...

2269
02:40:50,125 --> 02:40:52,958
This time I'll come alone.
I'll pay that place a visit.

2270
02:40:53,041 --> 02:40:55,500
-You are still colorful.
-Dhoopu uncle.

2271
02:40:56,041 --> 02:40:59,250
Dhoopu uncle. Dhoopu uncle.

2272
02:41:06,625 --> 02:41:09,166
My constable Sheru junior.

2273
02:41:10,125 --> 02:41:11,625
Where are your mom and dad?

2274
02:41:12,500 --> 02:41:14,958
-Dhoopu.
-Nisha.

2275
02:41:15,083 --> 02:41:17,291
Sheru... You look great.

2276
02:41:17,375 --> 02:41:20,708
Not Sheru, Sub Inspector Ratan!

2277
02:41:20,958 --> 02:41:21,916
Of Nagpur.

2278
02:41:27,291 --> 02:41:29,541
The same couple.

2279
02:41:29,708 --> 02:41:32,958
Mr. and Mrs. <i>'Goya ke chunanche'.</i>

2280
02:41:34,041 --> 02:41:36,791
-He is...
-He is...

2281
02:41:36,875 --> 02:41:38,791
This story... some other time.

2282
02:41:41,833 --> 02:41:44,208
Oh, Dinshaw. Come on.

2283
02:41:44,291 --> 02:41:46,125
Come on.

2284
02:41:48,416 --> 02:41:49,541
Bye...

2285
02:41:53,416 --> 02:41:55,082
Hurry up.
