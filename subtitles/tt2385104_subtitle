1
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,240
How do you know it's him?

2
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,540
We received voice samples from Mumbai.

3
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,850
'They must be taping
this conversation.'

4
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,698
The Mumbai Police
have given confirmation.

5
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,925
'These people are after me.'

6
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,391
'If I don't leave ccc...'

7
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,305
'...I'll rot the rest
of my life in Tihar Jail.'

8
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,130
'Don't get mad.'

9
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:20,436
'You don't shoot all year, do you?'

10
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:22,303
'You can join me two months later.'

11
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:25,943
That's it?

12
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:27,104
How did he find out?

13
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,511
About the extradition?

14
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:31,312
This information never left this room.

15
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:32,373
Then how?

16
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:35,082
Why...
- Ashwini.

17
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:38,685
Ashwini, we'll get him next time.

18
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,957
I hope so, sir.

19
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:44,152
I hope so.

20
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:49,592
'He's flying around
the world comfortably.'

21
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:51,762
'Everyone knows he's
holed up in Karachi.'

22
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,465
'This is the face
of India's Most Wanted...'

23
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:57,199
'Pakistan's his second home.
They protect him.'

24
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,335
'You've no evidence to support that.'

25
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:02,739
'He keeps targeting
us from Pakistan every time.'

26
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,282
'The operation was...'

27
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:07,946
Hand him over to India first,
then we'll see...'

28
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:09,915
'After the assassination of Osama...'

29
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:12,958
'...he's the 2nd Most
Wanted on Interpol's list.'

30
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:16,323
'This recent attack in Hyderabad
was clearly planned to kill...'

31
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:17,657
'...as many people...'
- 'We want Iqbal back.'

32
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:20,757
'We want Iqbal at any cost.'

33
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,630
'This is not about politics anymore.'

34
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:24,226
'This is about justice.'

35
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:35,474
'98.3 Fm, this is Sunset Somasa.'

36
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,345
'Hi, this is Suren
and with me is Meera.'

37
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,748
'And, everyone knows
about the Hyderabad blasts...'

38
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:41,787
'...that left 17 dead
and 119 injured...'

39
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:44,982
'...has shocked the entire
youth of the nation.'

40
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:47,288
'Everybody is still
coming to terms with this.'

41
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,056
'And, we've been receiving
calls from every corner of the city.'

42
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,963
'We should admit that we're cowards.'

43
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,728
'Kunal, I think you're getting
a little too emotional about this.'

44
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:59,260
'I think we should sever
all ties with Karachi.'

45
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:02,637
'And my children were saying
that his daughter's getting married.'

46
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,336
'Rama, you're absolutely right.'

47
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,412
'The images of the invitation cards...'

48
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,208
'...are already all over Facebook,
Twitter...'

49
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,748
'...and all the news channels.'

50
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,111
'I've just one question.'

51
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:14,050
'If the Americans can do it,
why can't we?'

52
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,951
'It's obvious that...'

53
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:18,320
Since Osama's assassination...

54
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,960
...people think Pakistan's
just another public park.

55
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,528
Easy as plucking a flower.

56
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,561
Is it that easy to bring him back?

57
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:33,030
What if it is?

58
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,633
What if we really bring him back?

59
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:42,772
INS Ranvijay. Where is it?

60
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,512
Same place he always is.

61
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:48,778
60 kilometres from Karachi coast.

62
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:50,656
Send them a message.

63
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,662
'The procession's on its way.'

64
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,096
Ladies and Gentlemen.

65
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,996
May I have your attention please.

66
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:04,662
Presenting Bilal Bhai Peshawarwale.

67
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:06,603
Hit it dude!

68
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,805
Did you have dinner?
- Everyone did.

69
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:19,515
Yes.
- Sir. The General's here.

70
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:37,460
Salim. He can't come here.

71
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:39,568
Anything's possible.

72
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:54,884
How dare you bring a phone here?

73
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:57,184
How dare you bring a phone here?
Get out. Get out!

74
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:00,291
Security! How did you let him in?

75
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,693
O the red robed, ...

76
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:11,669
...may I always have your
benign protection, Jhulelal.

77

Qalandar, Sire of Sindh

83
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:32,549
O the red robed, ...

84
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,459
...may I always have your
benign protection, Jhulelal.

85
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,087
O the red robed,...

86
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:41,895
...may I always have your
benign protection, Jhulelal.

87

00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:56,075
The red robed God-intoxicated
Qalandar, Sire of Sindh

91
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,142
The red robed God-intoxicated
Qalandar, Sire of Sindh

92
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:05,452
O the red robed, O the red robed

93
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:07,673
Yeah! Speak up, Pilot!

94
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,262
Uncle's on his way.

95
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:27,071
Pack.

96
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:33,045
I'll just go pee.

97
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:36,553
Pee? Or is it a new MMS?
- Balls.

98
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,149
I only settle for the real thing.

99
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:44,629
Your shrine is always
lighted with four lamps

100
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,567
Your shrine is always
lighted with four lamps

101
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,033
And here I come to light
a fifth lamp in your honor.

102
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,909
Here I come with fifth.

103
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,349
Secure all posts. P1. P3 and lift!

104
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:11,218
Salim. You go that way. Stay alert.

105
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:21,765
Here I come with fifth.

106
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,604
Here I come with fifth.

107
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:28,868
Here I come with fifth O master, ...

108
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:32,173
...friend and Sire
of Sindh and Sehwan,

109
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:34,337
God-intoxicated Qalandar,

110
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,507
The red robed
God-intoxicated Qalandar,

111
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:38,607
The Lord in every breath of mine,
glory be to you.

112
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:42,620
The red robed God-intoxicated
Qalandar, Sire of Sindh

113
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:47,887
O the red robed, O the red robed...

114
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:00,102
You haven't returned my mobile.

115
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,765
We didn't take your phone.

116
00:11:11,484 --> 00:11:16,854
Let the gong ring loud
for your glory day and night

117
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:24,955
Let the gong ring loud
for your glory day and night

118
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:29,495
Let the gong ring loud
for your glory day and night

119
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:38,168
Let the gong ring loud for your
glory day and night by the people.

120
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:43,171
Let the gong ring loud for your
glory day and night by the people.

121
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:44,374
Naushad!

122
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:50,419
Sir, this is restricted area.

123
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:51,782
Sir...

124
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:54,785
Naushad!

125
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:07,423
Go.

126
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:12,970
Sir, please. Stop.

127
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:14,699
You're not allowed here. Sir, please.

128
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:17,970
So you're going to restrict my entry.

129
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:19,635
Do you know who I am?

130
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,076
Faisal Kwaja's my uncle?
- Who's Faisal Kwaja?

131
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,947
Who? You don't know him?

132
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:29,246
Rafiq!

133
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,248
What are you doing?
They're just employees.

134
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:35,453
Let's go that way.

135
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:37,153
Come on.

136
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:39,252
Boss, do you have a lighter?

137
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:45,336
Security, Post-15.

138
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:46,598
Sir has arrived at P1.

139
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,799
Cover yourself.

140
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:52,138
Trying to entice them.
- What are you saying?

141
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:55,180
You've a character problem.
- Nonsense.

142
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,272
You think I don't know.

143
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,942
I am not blind.

144
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:00,474
Rafiq.

145
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:17,626
Why cover yourself now?
Half the world has seen them now.

146
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:18,965
Take it off.

147
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:20,530
Hello.

148
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:22,301
Speak louder.

149
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:23,567
Are you sure?

150
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,775
I'll call father. I'm fed up.

151
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,039
Fed up.

152
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:35,652
Stop.

153
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:44,759
Come from Lahore...

154
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,491
Sir, please speak here.

155
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,901
I'll call father now.
Father will come away.

156
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:59,540
I call father...

157
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,637
I'll call father now.

158
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,411
Father will come.

159
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,222
Father's here.
- He's here.

160
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:16,488
Yes.

161
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:21,417
Pull the trigger.

162
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:23,554
Don't delay anymore.

163
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:30,926
Otherwise,
it'll be a pain in your neck.

164
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:51,185
Kill them. Don't worry about me.

165
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:52,655
Kill them.

166
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:57,720
Get in quickly.

167
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,262
Get down. Down.

168
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,190
Rascal!

169
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,203
Wali, get in!

170
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,374
Get down.

171
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:20,417
Don't shoot him!

172
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:23,218
Don't shoot him!

173
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,075
'Prayers are for kin.'

174
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:56,851
'But we have no kin.'

175
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:58,856
'That's the reason why we're chosen.'

176
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:03,923
'Until nine years ago, nobody
cared whether I existed or not.'

177
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,292
'But, nine years is a long time.'

178
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:14,502
That's it.

179
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:17,008
That's all the attention I get.

180
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:22,746
There was a time,
when it was just about it.

181
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:25,408
I can say the same thing.

182
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:28,186
You don't give me
a second look either.

183
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:32,421
Like you used to, back in those days.

184
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:37,755
Let's turn back time.
- Don't be naughty.

185
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:39,922
I see, you're the one complaining
and I'm getting naughty?

186
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,056
Let go.

187
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,061
Let me go.

188
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:45,763
Son. Go back to sleep.

189
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,672
There's still time for school.
- No, it's not.

190
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:48,970
Get up. Or you'll be late.

191
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:51,338
No school, mom. I've fever.

192
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,344
You don't have fever.
It's just your excuses.

193
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:55,471
No. His body's burning.

194
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:58,312
Of course, he covered himself
with two blankets last night.

195
00:18:58,451 --> 00:18:59,884
Why do you cover
yourself with blankets?

196
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:02,284
Don't support him.
- The teacher's really strict.

197
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:03,878
And, I don't have a pencil either.

198
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,854
He doesn't have a pencil.
What will he do in school?

199
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:06,721
Don't go, son.

200
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:07,986
You bought pencils for him yesterday.

201
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,118
Here they are.

202
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:12,459
Perfumed ones!

203
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:14,690
Mom, Perfumed one's...
- No perfumed ones.

204
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,994
Take these.
- Mother.

205
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:17,296
I want perfumed ones.

206
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:19,394
Next time lose your bag, son.

207
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:20,700
Perfumed ones.

208
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:23,138
Mom, I want perfumed ones...

209
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:27,303
'For six years, I lived these
beautiful moments like a dream.'

210
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,681
'Knowing that I might
wake up any moment...'

211
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:32,478
'...and everything will shatter.'

212
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,952
'Nafisa and Kabir,
who were my biggest reality...'

213
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,182
'...would turn into my biggest lie.'

214
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:47,657
I want to go to your school.
- My school? Why is that?

215
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:52,170
Then, I can open my own barber shop.

216
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:55,338
You're not going to be a barber, son.

217
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,567
You'll be nipping their ears.

218
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:11,188
Out!
- Out!

219
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:14,118
Sachin has 100 centuries alone.

220
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,558
And look at them.

221
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:17,356
Together they can't
score a single century.

222
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:19,954
Brother Khurram,
these two will play till the end.

223
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:22,124
They don't have the guts to do that.

224
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,293
They don't even qualify
as the 12th Man.

225
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,565
The people are crazy after them.

226
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:28,633
As if they run the country.

227
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:31,198
They don't care about our sacrifices.

228
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:36,003
Because we don't have Pakistan's
T-shirt, like they do.

229
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:37,673
There it has started again.

230
00:20:40,286 --> 00:20:41,810
'Khurram took every opportunity...'

231
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:44,048
'...to assert that he's from ISI.'

232
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:46,118
'Years passed, with the hope that...'

233
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:49,820
'...I could extract information
from Khurram and report back.'

234
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:52,429
'But, those hopes had changed.'

235
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,532
'I was waiting for the day...'

236
00:20:57,603 --> 00:21:00,037
"Ashwini sir would release me from ...

237
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:01,936
...this posting and
this lie.' 'That's it.'

238
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,668
Stop the driver.

239
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:05,034
Ashwini.

240
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:08,338
People retire.
- I know.

241
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,643
I'm quitting my job,
so that I can devote my time to you.

242
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:13,685
Stop it...
- Coming.

243
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:15,920
Ramashray.

244
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:28,263
Mrs. Chaturvedi.

245
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:31,695
Old agents whom we're calling back.

246
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:36,101
Add another list to that name.

247
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:37,767
God is great!

248
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:12,867
Walekum Salaam.

249
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,310
We meet after a long time.

250
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,278
All okay?

251
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:18,911
How about you? How's your mother?

252
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,042
She's fine.

253
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,518
Convey her my respect.

254
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:23,111
What are you staring at?

255
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:25,948
Many other influential
people come here.

256
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:30,059
Who is he?
- Bhai!

257
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,597
He has other names.

258
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:35,526
Iqbal Seth. Sultan Shah.

259
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:37,393
Goldman.

260
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:38,902
No.2 in USA.

261
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:40,598
No.1 in India.

262
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:42,866
Wanted!

263
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:44,568
He's been coming here for years.

264
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,774
Everyone knows he's in Karachi.

265
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:49,177
But, even if they know...

266
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:51,748
...no one can even whisper about it.

267
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,282
Do you work for him?
- Yes.

268
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:55,748
That's my duty.

269
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:58,922
I'm from the ISI.

270
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:00,649
But no one could know.

271
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:04,352
Everyone's on their tether.

272
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,198
His son's getting married.

273
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:10,500
He's booked more than
half of the hotel rooms.

274
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:12,068
It's going to be great fun.

275
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:14,002
Take the salad as well.

276
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:16,805
My son's getting married...

277
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,536
...next month on the 12th.

278
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:21,640
Do come.
- Of course.

279
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:23,576
People aren't wrong along.

280
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,645
Times are wrong as well.

281
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:30,246
For the sake of my future,
for Kabir and Nafisa...

282
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:34,425
...I could've ignored this man.

283
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:36,927
Father can't buy them all the time.

284
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:42,259
But, I couldn't do it.

285
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:58,248
We've six active agents in Pakistan.

286
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:01,079
And, we can contact
two of them anytime we want.

287
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:03,178
None of them told us.

288
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:05,986
So, where did you
get this information?

289
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:45,228
Ashwini, what was the
name of your field agent?

290
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,627
Sir didn't tell us.

291
00:24:46,732 --> 00:24:47,926
He's probably one
of his secret agents...

292
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,058
He is the only one
with access to the file...

293
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:51,534
Well, with due respect
to Ashwini sir...

294
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:58,202
...these unknown agents...
could be double-agents as well.

295
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:04,606
Madam's calling you.

296
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:11,486
Ashwini.

297
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:21,799
Ashwini, India can never be a part...

298
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,563
...of any covert operation
on Pakistani soil.

299
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:26,934
Yes, sir.

300
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:31,875
I cannot do it.

301
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:35,402
That doesn't mean you can't.

302
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,975
I said it. I'm not going alone.

303
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:50,351
You just said...

304
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:53,152
...you told everyone
we're going to London.

305
00:26:53,492 --> 00:26:57,258
The arrangements are done.
- I never said we aren't going.

306
00:26:57,396 --> 00:26:59,023
I won't go alone.

307
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:00,723
I've never travelled
on a plane before?

308
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:04,063
Okay, but they won't
ask you to fly that thing.

309
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:09,139
I'll escort you to the plane.

310
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:11,675
After that, your brother
will receive you at the airport.

311
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:12,903
Kabir's with you as well.

312
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:16,310
Few days later, I'll sell
everything here and join you.

313
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:17,910
If its just few days...

314
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:19,746
...then, why can't we go together?

315
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,554
Again the same thing,
I said I've to stay back.

316
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:27,422
Your tickets have been issued as well.

317
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:31,394
Cancelling all the tickets
would mean a huge loss. Right?

318
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:33,389
Shall I cancel them?

319
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,365
It's just a matter of days.

320
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:39,336
Then, we'll be out there.

321
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:42,804
Getting naughty like the English do.

322
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:46,143
Look here.

323
00:27:46,678 --> 00:27:49,408
Sexy.
- Don't try to cajole me.

324
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:51,045
I won't go.

325
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:54,917
Try to understand.

326
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:57,981
Someone's coming. From afar.

327
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:05,123
'Distancing my kin and
working with strangers...'

328
00:28:05,197 --> 00:28:07,256
'...was a part of my job.'

329
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,267
'But maybe,
I wasn't comfortable with it now.'

330
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,665
'Who was Zoya Rehman.'

331
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,068
'Did she have secrets like me?'

332
00:28:20,145 --> 00:28:21,942
I work for the Bradford City Council.

333
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,877
You visit the city quite often.

334
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,810
Stay alone in the hotel.

335
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:28,075
Doesn't your husband get furious?

336
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:32,513
'Moin. We can celebrate
our anniversary later.'

337
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:35,219
'This case is a little complicated.
I've to go.'

338
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:37,521
'Are you the only
immigration lawyer in UK?'

339
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,621
'Actually, you want to go.
- So?'

340
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:40,931
'What's wrong about it, Moin?'

341
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,473
'The fact that you didn't tell me...'

342
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:44,375
'...your job's more important
than our marriage.'

343
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:46,961
'Please, Moin.
You know that's not true.'

344
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,370
'Please Zoya. Please.'

345
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,805
'You know it's true.'

346
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:51,634
'And, now I know it too.'

347
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:54,211
'Won't you say bye.
- I will.'

348
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:56,107
'Goodbye.'

349
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:04,944
What?

350
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,786
I had given strict instructions.

351
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,049
I want room no.1222.

352
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:11,960
Believe me, madam.
1222 and 1224 are the same.

353
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,055
And so is the view.
- I don't care about the view.

354
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:15,693
'The celebration
was on the top floor...'

355
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,191
'...and security was
tight on the east zone.

356
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:22,272
Be quick. - Uptil 2 kms,
on the road I want my own people.

357
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,864
Aziz.
- Yes, Sir.

358
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:25,304
I don't know how.

359
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:27,345
But, I want the footage
from every room in this hotel...

360
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:30,540
...on my monitors.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:33,182
'And, Zoya had to
stay on the 12th floor...'

362
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:35,810
'...in room no.1222,
directly below the security room.'

363
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:37,212
Pardon me, madam.

364
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:39,085
But Mr. Bhatti,
he's a regular customer...

365
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:40,419
...arrived uninformed.

366
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:42,823
Just two days,
and we'll shift you back.

367
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:47,695
Who... are you trying to shift?

368
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:50,098
Mr. Bhatti, messages for you.

369
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:58,436
Don't worry.

370
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:01,143
I am there.

371
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,609
You can shift rooms
anytime you want. Yes.

372
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:15,184
For the next 24 hours,
no one can pee without me watching.

373
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,352
Get that?
- Yes, sir.

374
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:18,122
And, vacate the floor below.

375
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,767
If you cannot get this floor vacated...

376
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:28,362
...we will have to post
a man at every 5 feet.

377
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,930
We can't take chances.

378
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:31,873
And lock all the open rooms.

379
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:33,444
Check the identity of every guest.

380
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:35,240
I want no guests up here.

381
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:39,450
'Zoya Rehman. Sharyar Bhatti.'

382
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:42,145
'Room nos. 1224, 1222.'

383
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,949
'The plans looked clear on paper...'

384
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:46,684
'...but in reality,
they were fading away.'

385
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:49,658
'There were questions,
that didn't have an answer.'

386
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:52,821
'Our fear was, that it
doesn't foil before it starts.'

387
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,297
Excuse me, get side. Please.

388
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,457
Please.

389
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:00,597
Seth's home first.
- Yes, boss.

390
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:11,339
Aslam needed freedom
from his three murder cases...

391
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,981
Ashwini sir laid a price to it...

392
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:16,320
He was sent to jail...

393
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:18,822
to befriend Goldman's
man Pappu Samaan...

394
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,183
Sir, do you have matches, or lighter.

395
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:26,319
Sir, he hasn't shown much faith.

396
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:29,162
Pappu's paid me to kill Vicky Thakur.

397
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:31,774
After that he'll send
me to our neighbour's country.

398
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:32,929
Do it.

399
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:45,411
Pappu Samaan kept his promise...'

400
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:48,213
'...and sent Aslam
to Gurudan in Karachi.'

401
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,783
'If he survives this mission...'

402
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:53,881
'...we'll know whether
the price was too high or not.'

403
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,998
Salaam, sister-in-law.
- Walekum Salaam.

404
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:02,760
Is the brother in?
- Yea.

405
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:05,359
Salim, meet me before leaving.
- Yes.

406
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,706
Fall. Fall.

407
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,505
Concentrate on the heel.

408
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:15,210
Speak, Salim, speak.

409
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:16,302
I'm just coming from the hotel.

410
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:17,507
All the arrangements have been done.

411
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:19,140
I'll give you the details later.

412
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,419
General Raza is waiting for you.

413
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,359
Don't drop the guard.

414
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,117
Salaam, Mr. General.
- Walekum.

415
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:29,058
The master at his slave's home.

416
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:31,593
Iqbal, you know why I am here.

417
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:35,793
Well, we've bought you
a house in London, Park Lane.

418
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,630
Salim. Did you give sir the papers?

419
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:39,636
Yes, sir.
- Don't try to change the topic.

420
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,433
You cannot attend the wedding.

421
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,976
Look, you asked me not
to attend my daughter's wedding.

422
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:46,237
And, I didn't.

423
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:47,740
I was in the same hotel.

424
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:50,178
I watched everything on a television,
in a closed room.

425
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:51,872
But not this time.

426
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:54,474
All the rituals are in Karachi.

427
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,413
We aren't allowing
photography... Video...

428
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:01,959
Nephew will give you the details.

429
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,360
But my son's wedding...

430
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:09,024
Try and understand.
- Please excuse me.

431
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:10,465
Mr. Azhar's waiting for me.

432
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:13,402
Iqbal, Islamabad's...
- If we delay any longer...

433
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:16,167
....they might blow this place up.
- You don't...

434
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:17,333
Quddoos.
- Salim...

435
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:18,569
Serve him some cold drinks.

436
00:33:18,643 --> 00:33:20,403
You know he can't attend
the wedding. - But...

437
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:21,639
We're trying our best,
but uncle's not prepared to listen.

438
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:23,008
What can we do?
- Quiet!

439
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:23,915
Tell him to shut up!

440
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:30,778
Hyderabad.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:35,983
No, Azhar. My heart's not into it.

442
00:33:38,463 --> 00:33:40,693
I'm not too popular.

443
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:44,430
People think I'm a terrorist.

444
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:49,871
This is just my business,
I only do my job.

445
00:33:50,775 --> 00:33:52,868
Otherwise, I'm human too.

446
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:56,447
I do charity. I help people.

447
00:33:56,614 --> 00:33:58,582
We're here for your help.

448
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:00,684
When you do something...

449
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:04,552
....It pulls our people out of danger.

450
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:09,020
We desperately need
an action in Hyderabad.

451
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:14,296
How many?
- It'll be controlled.

452
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:15,890
8 or 10.

453
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:22,302
Ruins business, for a long time.

454
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,169
I give you my word.

455
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:26,369
Not more than 15 people.

456
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:32,212
Iqbal...
- No matter what you say...

457
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:33,323
....I won't change my mind.

458
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:34,545
You don't understand.

459
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,610
Iqbal...
- You don't understand!

460
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:40,923
My business runs on fear.

461
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:46,622
If I get scared,
business will close down.

462
00:34:58,376 --> 00:34:59,673
The orders were direct.

463
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:01,268
Stay away from the
Target until the mission.

464
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:02,643
Stay low...

465
00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:07,106
But this man could
never follow any orders...

466
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:11,852
The fourth wheel of the team,
Rudra Pratap Singh.

467
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:15,115
He was more like a riddle,
without an answer.

468
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:24,535
Suspended army officer,
killer, mercenary.

469
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:26,896
No one knew who he was.

470
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:28,495
Where he came from.

471
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:34,574
He never listened to anyone
nor told anyone about him.

472
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,194
Like every mission...

473
00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:54,993
....the safest place to hideout was...

474
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:57,660
....the murky lanes of
Karachi's prostitute area...

475
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:01,595
Where no one cared who you were...

476
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:03,970
All that mattered was the
price you were willing to pay.

477
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:15,548
You walk straight in the dark.

478
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:20,557
You're either a thief or a soldier.

479
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:49,548
Either get to work
straightaway or keep chatting.

480
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:11,799
The less questions you ask,
the better.

481
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:27,552
May I come in, sir?

482
00:37:28,393 --> 00:37:32,489
Sir. I've got a weird tip
in the Vicky Thakur murder case.

483
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,756
There's a rumour in the department...

484
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:35,992
....that the killer made
a deal with the agency.

485
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:38,833
He's been sent to Karachi.

486
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:41,599
Is it a part of your dream project?

487
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:43,497
Which dream project?

488
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:45,235
The one you shut down.

489
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:48,504
You didn't shut it down completely.

490
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,411
That much I know you.

491
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:53,909
Mishra. There's a big difference...

492
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:56,453
....between knowing and understanding.

493
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:04,492
Yeah.

494
00:38:04,562 --> 00:38:06,621
How are the neighbours, Ghosh?

495
00:38:06,698 --> 00:38:09,292
You never call to
ask about their health.

496
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,096
I'm the cultural attaché...

497
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:13,069
....but, you receive every news first.

498
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:14,966
I've heard that our
favourite son-in-law...

499
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:18,406
....Is getting his son married.
- I heard that too.

500
00:38:19,444 --> 00:38:21,344
So like a good neighbour...

501
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:23,277
....we'll have to give our best wishes.

502
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:26,784
Post an ad in the Dawn, on our behalf.

503
00:38:37,128 --> 00:38:39,119
Seven days, seven sim cards.

504
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:42,197
Use one everyday, and destroy it.

505
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:44,628
We'll need detonators, timers.

506
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:46,369
Symtex as well.

507
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:47,969
Any grade will do.

508
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,973
There're dogs in the hotel.

509
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,539
Sniffer dogs.

510
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:53,743
You've to arrange for an ambulance.

511
00:38:53,845 --> 00:38:55,506
It'll be done. That's easy.

512
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,115
The arms... - I'll come
along for weapons selection.

513
00:39:00,852 --> 00:39:04,344
Karachi's Napier road's different,
your cover will be blown.

514
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:06,455
You're just an asset.

515
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:07,889
Your job's to give us information.

516
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:09,892
You've been recruited from GIC.

517
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:11,155
Before coming here...

518
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:13,463
....the only thing you ever
shot was a cardboard cut out.

519
00:39:13,464 --> 00:39:14,897
I'm doing my job.

520
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:18,091
I didn't get suspended from the army,
like you.

521
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:23,138
You're a part of the team. That's it.

522
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:25,567
Understand.

523
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:29,803
I'm not too fond of teams.

524
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:32,214
They're best for playing footballs.

525
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:35,082
More the people, more weaknesses.

526
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:36,882
Then why don't you
execute the operation?

527
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,421
You don't need us.

528
00:39:38,823 --> 00:39:41,223
You'll find him strolling
down the market. Go catch him.

529
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,389
Remember one thing.

530
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:45,755
This is not your country.

531
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:52,660
Keep it concealed.
Don't lift the veil.

532
00:39:52,737 --> 00:39:55,433
Salaam.
- Walekum.

533
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:59,009
I knew you were a good barber.

534
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:01,637
But, I didn't know
you were good at this too.

535
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:06,514
No...
- Don't be scared.

536
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:09,144
A man without secrets is boring.

537
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,118
Everyone does.

538
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:12,053
I do too.

539
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:13,618
No.
- Yes.

540
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:16,694
Khurram. Don't tell anyone.
- No.

541
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:20,659
Please leave,
you're spoiling my business.

542
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,564
I'll be right back.

543
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,952
Who was he?

544
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:51,826
I don't have to tell you.

545
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:10,645
Look. I know everything about you.

546
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:13,846
The route you take
your child to school.

547
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:17,016
The shop you buy
perfume for your wife.

548
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:22,124
He's a customer.

549
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,150
He's ISI.

550
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:27,058
Lt. Col. Khurram Khan...

551
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:28,462
Get that?

552
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:35,600
And?

553
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:36,934
And?

554
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:38,669
He's my neighbour.

555
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:42,772
Don't ever drag my wife
and child in this again?

556
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:45,846
I love them.

557
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:48,078
That's why I say.

558
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,014
More people, means more weaknesses.

559
00:41:58,296 --> 00:42:00,025
'Rudra was right.'

560
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:02,697
'More people, means more weaknesses.'

561
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:05,432
'But, he didn't know.'

562
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:08,163
'Mistakes are like relationships.'

563
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:11,768
'You don't make one, it happens.'

564
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:17,341
Back again? How?

565
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:21,811
Can't be love.
- No.

566
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,012
I heard you don't
ask too many questions.

567
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:28,250
And anyway, no one comes here.

568
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:33,720
Either get to work
straightaway or keep chatting.

569
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:37,801
Pardon me, but this is important.

570
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:42,333
I see.

571
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:44,772
What do you think?

572
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:24,542
What's the story behind this?

573
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:15,598
Good morning, ma'am.

574
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:23,401
Come in.

575
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:28,369
This is your room.

576
00:44:28,446 --> 00:44:30,346
It's been newly painted.

577
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,780
Sir, bed no.2 is yours.
- Join it with bed no.3.

578
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:40,379
You see, I like to
toss around in my sleep.

579
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,956
The target's car
will approach from P1.

580
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:45,359
We'll enter from P3.

581
00:44:45,463 --> 00:44:46,691
We'll intercept him on P3.

582
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:49,129
And the exit.

583
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,495
P1 for you, and I'll exit this way.

584
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:53,901
We'll blow this room with RDX semtex.

585
00:44:54,105 --> 00:44:56,198
The purer, the better.

586
00:44:56,307 --> 00:44:57,899
The entire floor...
- Perfumed?

587
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:28,900
I'll need big pots...

588
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:30,565
....to take the semtex in the hotel.

589
00:45:37,415 --> 00:45:40,145
51....Stout Street.

590
00:45:40,484 --> 00:45:44,113
Gareen Rd...
- No, Mom. it's Green.

591
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:47,713
Green.
- Yes, Green.

592
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,123
Ph...

593
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:53,562
You'll be with me,
so you can tell them. it'll be okay.

594
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:55,495
Sending us to London alone...

595
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:05,466
Perfumed ones?
- Yes.

596
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,878
Look, Rameez. Perfumed pencils.

597
00:46:08,979 --> 00:46:10,913
Father brought them for me.

598
00:46:20,324 --> 00:46:24,818
Why don't you read this
out in English for me...

599
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:27,024
What road? What 'Bury'?

600
00:46:42,113 --> 00:46:44,604
Do you have such beautiful
girls back there?

601
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:46,677
Where?

602
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:48,884
The place you hail from.

603
00:46:50,488 --> 00:46:56,085
Your beautiful kohl eyes.

604
00:46:56,794 --> 00:46:58,056
That's Black.

605
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:39,959
Wait a moment more....

606
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:56,076
Wait a moment more....

607
00:47:57,688 --> 00:48:10,658
Your lips still have
my essence on them.

608
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:22,079
Wait a moment more....

609
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:51,165
The dewdrops are shining
with the morning rays.

610
00:48:51,742 --> 00:49:05,054
But my world of
dreams is still alive.

611
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:14,891
Wait a moment more....

612
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:28,377
Your lips still have
my essence on them.

613
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:32,139
Wait a moment more....

614
00:49:32,716 --> 00:49:33,910
There goes the power again.

615
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:36,282
Shut up. Who needs electricity here!

616
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:38,446
Ali. Start the generator.

617
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:16,123
I won't ask.

618
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:19,519
Because I can't hear you lie.

619
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:23,059
Really?

620
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:33,374
You sleep with people,
and I put them to sleep.

621
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:37,541
The lesser you know, the better.

622
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:41,211
The more you know,
the more difficult it'll get for me...

623
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:42,842
....and painful for you.

624
00:50:43,754 --> 00:50:45,221
It won't.

625
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:50,225
Anyway, I'm used to men leaving me.

626
00:50:52,996 --> 00:50:54,725
There's a difference
between them and me.

627
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:57,798
I know that.

628
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:03,162
You never showed
sympathy or false hopes.

629
00:51:03,941 --> 00:51:06,842
I never expected the impossible.

630
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:11,040
But, you gave me
something I didn't expect.

631
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:19,919
What do you want?

632
00:51:32,102 --> 00:51:33,467
The man who did this.

633
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:43,271
Do you want his death
to be easy or painful?

634
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:11,037
Semtex?
- On the way, freshly baked.

635
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:14,476
The buyer's coming
personally to sell them.

636
00:52:14,578 --> 00:52:16,045
Don't open your big mouth,
like last time.

637
00:52:16,146 --> 00:52:18,307
I will make the deal...
- Welcome, Khurram.

638
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:19,644
You!

639
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,670
Rascals...

640
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:19,828
Take me to the police station.

641
00:55:18,595 --> 00:55:19,823
Police!

642
00:55:31,008 --> 00:55:32,441
Put that away.

643
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:36,973
Don't just wield that thing,
know how to use it as well.

644
00:55:54,431 --> 00:55:55,864
There's news, sir.

645
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:57,795
Two more dead bodies
were found at Bohra Bazaar.

646
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:59,334
Wasim Ali and his wife.

647
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:00,737
There have been other incidents...

648
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:02,198
....between these two gangs before.

649
00:56:02,706 --> 00:56:05,140
Look at the entry wounds carefully.

650
00:56:10,514 --> 00:56:12,311
It's professional killing, sir.

651
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,719
Has your mission been
activated in Karachi?

652
00:56:22,726 --> 00:56:25,058
The Ministry wants answers, sir!

653
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:33,730
Don't worry, Mishra.

654
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:36,271
I'll give them answers.

655
00:56:37,941 --> 00:56:39,431
I haven't retired yet.

656
00:56:43,346 --> 00:56:44,574
One more thing.

657
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:47,475
No mission's ever personal.

658
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:50,325
It's in the interest of the country.

659
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:54,357
No, sir. Don't call off the operation.

660
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:55,823
Believe me.

661
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:57,382
The target is not suspicious...

662
00:56:57,494 --> 00:57:00,088
Khurram Mirza died
while protecting you.

663
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:02,203
Something's definitely happening,
I'm sure about it.

664
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:03,865
Your family's leaving
for London tomorrow.

665
00:57:03,934 --> 00:57:05,162
Not now! Out!

666
00:57:05,268 --> 00:57:06,326
Out!

667
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:09,866
Your family's leaving
for London tomorrow.

668
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,929
You go too.

669
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:13,703
Don't blame me for Khurram's death.

670
00:57:14,277 --> 00:57:18,043
You know who else he was working for.

671
00:57:18,548 --> 00:57:21,415
I don't understand why you're
being so stubborn this time.

672
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:24,454
Tomorrow? I can go today if you want.

673
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:26,254
But this is our last chance.

674
00:57:26,323 --> 00:57:27,449
We won't get another opportunity.

675
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:29,458
We shouldn't lose
this opportunity, sir.

676
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:33,985
General. Try to understand.

677
00:57:35,298 --> 00:57:39,667
Two by-passes, one son.

678
00:57:40,203 --> 00:57:43,639
I'm definitely attending
the wedding. Cheers.

679
00:57:43,774 --> 00:57:45,503
We aren't doing this for a medal, sir.

680
00:57:45,575 --> 00:57:47,702
What's going to happen
even if we bring him back?

681
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:49,305
We'll still be unknown.

682
00:57:49,379 --> 00:57:51,347
And if we fail,
we'll be begging for death...

683
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:52,938
....but, we won't get it, sir.

684
00:57:58,955 --> 00:58:00,582
Awaiting your orders, sir.

685
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:08,456
The color of everyone's
fortunes is the same

686
00:58:08,532 --> 00:58:16,701
The color of everyone's
fortunes is the same

687
00:58:16,807 --> 00:58:22,109
Sorrow and happiness
play hide and seek...

688
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:30,210
Happiness and sorrow
play hide and seek...

689
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:34,915
You are in my life,
you are in my soul...

690
00:58:35,025 --> 00:58:39,587
You are in my whole world...

691
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:44,157
You are in my life,
you are in my soul...

692
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:48,601
You are in my whole world...

693
00:58:48,672 --> 00:58:55,737
The color of everyone's
fortunes is the same

694
00:58:55,812 --> 00:59:00,408
Sorrow and happiness
play hide and seek...

695
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:04,544
My Lord is playing Holi

696
00:59:04,621 --> 00:59:06,589
You'll be an NRI now.

697
00:59:06,656 --> 00:59:08,351
Thank you, thank you.

698
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:10,526
Kabir. Tell mom uncle's here.

699
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:14,394
His color's unique.

700
00:59:14,464 --> 00:59:17,865
My Lord is playing Holi

701
00:59:17,968 --> 00:59:19,492
Mom. Uncle's here.

702
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:24,398
He is sprinkling water of his deeds

703
00:59:24,474 --> 00:59:28,934
He is sprinkling water of his deeds

704
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:32,709
That colors the whole world

705
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:34,647
My Lord is playing Holi

706
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:37,482
Uncle, you don't know that much.
It's the other side.

707
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:40,815
Remember.
When I brought this proposal...

708
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:43,325
I know, I know. I was stubborn.

709
00:59:43,426 --> 00:59:45,690
I said I don't want
to marry a barber.

710
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:48,424
But now, he's taking me to London.
- Coming.

711
00:59:48,498 --> 00:59:50,966
I'm so fortunate to have
such a wonderful husband.

712
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:53,433
Now, find someone
like him for them too.

713
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:56,063
He really pampers you.

714
00:59:58,742 --> 01:00:00,972
He is sprinkling water of his deeds

715
01:00:01,077 --> 01:00:03,238
He is sprinkling water of his deeds

716
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:05,906
That colors the whole world

717
01:00:05,982 --> 01:00:09,713
The color of love is exquisite

718
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:14,155
The color of your love is exquisite

719
01:00:14,257 --> 01:00:19,058
The color of your love is exquisite

720
01:00:19,129 --> 01:00:21,757
The color of your love is exquisite

721
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:25,794
We needed more cards.

722
01:00:25,902 --> 01:00:27,927
So, Salim asked me to....

723
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,175
Why just two...
- Two.... two...

724
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:34,743
Why are you stammering?

725
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:36,779
Do you stammer?
- No?

726
01:00:38,448 --> 01:00:40,780
Go on.
- Thank you.

727
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:56,130
Getting colored has become my habit

728
01:00:56,199 --> 01:01:01,899
My love for him is my prayer

729
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:11,140
Getting colored has become my habit

730
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:13,512
My love for him is my prayer

731
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,847
Everything is safe
due to his presence

732
01:01:15,919 --> 01:01:18,752
Due to his gaze, everyone is blessed

733
01:01:18,855 --> 01:01:23,815
Everyone is blessed

734
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:28,057
Even destiny dances in his praises

735
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:32,192
You're tea's getting cold.
- He's the one who holds the strings

736
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:36,705
My Lord is playing Holi

737
01:01:37,173 --> 01:01:39,573
He is sprinkling water of his deeds

738
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:41,837
He is sprinkling water of his deeds

739
01:01:41,945 --> 01:01:44,812
That colors the whole world

740
01:01:45,715 --> 01:01:47,342
Allah -O- Akbar!

741
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:48,975
Allah -O- Akbar!

742
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:50,677
Allah -O- Akbar!

743
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:52,346
Allah -O- Akbar!

744
01:01:52,422 --> 01:01:53,548
Allah -O- Akbar!

745
01:01:53,623 --> 01:01:57,218
The color of love is exquisite

746
01:01:57,293 --> 01:02:00,956
The color of your love is exquisite

747
01:02:01,064 --> 01:02:02,725
The color of love is exquisite

748
01:02:02,832 --> 01:02:06,495

The color of your love is exquisite

750
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:13,769
Allah -O- Akbar!

751
01:02:13,977 --> 01:02:15,501
Allah -O- Akbar!

752
01:02:15,578 --> 01:02:16,476
Allah -O- Akbar!

753
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:18,308
Do you want me to
keep repeating myself?

754
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:21,441
It's broken now.
I told you it's empty.

755
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:22,576
And...

756
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:23,676
It's smashed to bits.

757
01:02:23,787 --> 01:02:25,254
Who's going to pay for all of this?

758
01:02:25,355 --> 01:02:27,380
Ma'am, we'll need to check it.
- Check? Check what?

759
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,514
What did you get in it?

760
01:02:28,591 --> 01:02:30,218
You can break that too.
Here, you can break this too.

761
01:02:30,326 --> 01:02:32,089
Happy? Break that too.

762
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:37,560
Forget the checking.

763
01:02:38,068 --> 01:02:40,195
Her eyes can kill anyone.

764
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:43,704
She won't smuggle in bombs.

765
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:48,936
Please. Welcome.

766
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:08,558

01:03:13,736 --> 01:03:14,930
'I'll call you back, bye.'

770
01:03:26,483 --> 01:03:30,283

Hello.

815
01:06:43,479 --> 01:06:44,844
Mr. Bhatti.

816
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:18,206
The government of India...

817
01:07:18,314 --> 01:07:22,717
....Is blaming Pakistan,
for the bomb blasts In Hyderabad.

818
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:26,084
According to a press
report released in Islamabad...

819
01:07:26,189 --> 01:07:30,717
....the Pakistan government
has denied this in strong words.

820
01:07:30,827 --> 01:07:33,352
Even after Pakistan
government's constant denial...

821
01:07:33,429 --> 01:07:35,761
....the Indian government
is not ready to believe...

822
01:07:35,832 --> 01:07:37,925
....that their culprit
isn't hiding in Pakistan.

823
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,627
Islamabad...

824
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:40,634
Sir.
- Ashwini here.

825
01:07:40,737 --> 01:07:43,297
Is the plan still the same?
- You heard it on the radio too.

826
01:07:43,373 --> 01:07:46,240
Bring him back.
INS Ranvijay is standing by.

827
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:47,333
Okay, sir.

828
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:24,241
You see those small shops.

829
01:08:24,347 --> 01:08:25,905
Yes.
- They'll give you two cards...

830
01:08:26,015 --> 01:08:27,505
Passengers flying to London...

831
01:08:27,617 --> 01:08:29,209
Please come with me.
- Yes. Keep this...

832
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:31,878
Aren't you coming together?
- I can't go beyond this.

01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:35,052
Kabir.

834
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,926
Father. Goodbye.

835
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:30,242
Listen, one thing.
- Go now.

836
01:10:56,232 --> 01:10:58,029
The volcano eruption in Iceland...

837
01:10:58,134 --> 01:11:00,432
....has spread ash cloud all over.

838
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:04,337
Due to this, all flights
to Europe have been cancelled.

839
01:11:04,407 --> 01:11:05,874
For more information...
- Excuse me...

840
01:11:05,975 --> 01:11:07,465

What? Fire?

846
01:11:32,969 --> 01:11:36,029
Let's go. Let's go quickly.
- But why?

847
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:39,567
Mom - Let's go.
- Mom, wait...

848
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,642
Excuse me, ma'am.
May I help you? - I have to go out.

849
01:11:42,745 --> 01:11:44,906
It's very important.
I have to go home.

850
01:11:45,014 --> 01:11:47,278
Everyone wants to go home.
The flight's been cancelled.

851
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,374
Everyone's worried.
Please take a seat.

852
01:11:48,484 --> 01:11:50,042
You don't understand.

853
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,850
My house is on fire.
I can't reach his father on the phone.

854
01:11:52,922 --> 01:11:55,220
I have to go home. it's important.

855
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:56,280
Where do you live?

856
01:11:58,394 --> 01:12:00,191
Salim, I'll be in Baituz soon.

857
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:02,520
The neighbours were saying that...

858
01:12:02,632 --> 01:12:04,193
....the entire family's flown to London.

859
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:06,325
But we recovered three dead bodies.

860
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:08,025
The husband, wife and child.

861
01:12:08,137 --> 01:12:09,297
Three?

862
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:12,899
Wife and child?
- Mom, what's wrong with father?

863
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:15,239
Nothing, child. Finish your drawing.

864
01:12:15,878 --> 01:12:18,813

867
01:12:31,427 --> 01:12:32,621
Mom...

868
01:12:32,928 --> 01:12:34,657

Why aren't you telling
us anything about him?

871

Is he fine?

872
01:12:41,003 --> 01:12:42,937
He has sold his shop.
- Mom...

873
01:12:43,005 --> 01:12:45,633

01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:01,339
They are three.

887
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:03,918
Wali, get in the car.

888
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,751
Wali, get in.
- Don't shoot him.

889
01:14:10,926 --> 01:14:12,223
Don't shoot him.

890
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:18,728
'That moment I put
everything at stake.'

891
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:22,137
'My nine year dream, our lives, '

892
01:14:22,404 --> 01:14:25,601
'But, maybe that was our
last chance to end this story.'

893
01:14:37,553 --> 01:14:38,884
Move, move!

894
01:14:43,392 --> 01:14:44,689
Don't spare them!

895
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:46,451
Shoot them.

896
01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:00,165
Pass the gun.

897
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:13,521
Catch him! Catch him!

898
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:26,391
Don't spare!

899
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:44,345
There's been a huge blast....

900
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,785
....inside this basement.

901
01:15:47,156 --> 01:15:51,684
And five minutes before
the blast we could heard gunfire.

902
01:15:51,794 --> 01:15:54,160
And it seems like the
extremists responsible...

903
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:57,427
....for the ballroom blast
are hiding in this basement.

904
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:22,656
I tried to explain you.

905
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:24,350
Now do you understand?

906
01:16:25,394 --> 01:16:26,986
Forget this, doctor.

907
01:16:27,062 --> 01:16:28,654
Look after others.

908
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:40,568
I've a reputation.

909
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,743
You get that, Salim Pathan.

910
01:16:44,847 --> 01:16:46,781
I've a reputation.

911
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:48,841
This can ruin it.

912
01:16:54,056 --> 01:16:56,684
If they escape,
they take my reputation along.

913
01:17:05,234 --> 01:17:07,361
Close down Karachi.

914
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:37,626
Mister, this isn't right.
There are bedbugs in our bed.

915
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,826
Come.
- Get rid of them.

916
01:17:38,934 --> 01:17:40,094
That's enough.

917
01:17:47,142 --> 01:17:49,406
Salaam.
- Walekum Salaam.

918
01:17:49,812 --> 01:17:51,473
My name's Niyaz Ahmed.

919
01:17:58,854 --> 01:18:00,583
Do you have any news about him?

920
01:18:01,256 --> 01:18:03,190
Are you hiding something from us?

921
01:18:03,258 --> 01:18:04,885
He's alive.

922
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:12,162
Ask the child to eat.

923
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:13,931
He must be hungry.

924
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:23,244
Your husband's a barber.

925
01:18:23,312 --> 01:18:24,711
Owns a small shop.

926
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,811
Where did he get the
money to go to London?

927
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:32,114
It's the grace of God.
- 17,421!

928
01:18:40,195 --> 01:18:42,288
This is your husband's bank statement.

929
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:44,692
17,421, that's the
amount in his account.

930
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,563
That's all the grace he gets.

931
01:18:48,704 --> 01:18:50,464
Where did he get the
money to buy the ticket?

932
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:58,913
We were saving for it.

933
01:18:59,314 --> 01:19:00,338
And...

934
01:19:00,816 --> 01:19:02,750
Why don't you speak with my husband?

935
01:19:02,818 --> 01:19:06,049
His number...
- 03453061789.

936
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:08,349
It's switched off.

937
01:19:10,325 --> 01:19:12,953
It was switched off right
after dropping you at the airport.

938
01:19:13,028 --> 01:19:14,290
Or maybe...

939
01:19:14,696 --> 01:19:16,596
The sim-card's been destroyed.

940
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:22,933
'The real motive behind the blast...'

941
01:19:23,005 --> 01:19:25,769
Four Indians...
are responsible for this attack.

942
01:19:26,275 --> 01:19:28,038
Four Indian officers.

943
01:19:28,811 --> 01:19:31,109
Four Indian terrorists.

944
01:19:36,618 --> 01:19:37,949
'Try to understand.'

945
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:41,387
'Someone's coming.'

946
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:46,317
We don't know who shot first...

947
01:19:46,462 --> 01:19:48,089
....but the last bullet...

948
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:52,792
....Injured your husband Wali Khan.

949
01:19:57,272 --> 01:19:58,603
That's true.

950
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:01,032
And he is also not to be found.

951
01:20:03,712 --> 01:20:06,180
Come on.
- What's wrong, mom?

952
01:20:08,951 --> 01:20:11,419
If you leave,
this situation won't get any better...

953
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,953
....Instead, it'll get worse.

954
01:20:13,122 --> 01:20:14,384
Take a seat.

955
01:20:15,591 --> 01:20:18,560
You're surely mistaken
about my husband.

956
01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:21,461
You can ask anyone about him.

957
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:23,092
He's a good man.

958
01:20:23,165 --> 01:20:24,757
He can never do such a thing.

959
01:20:25,434 --> 01:20:26,765
He's a devout.

960
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:28,359
Love's Kabir.

961
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:30,899
Respects me.

962
01:20:32,074 --> 01:20:33,974
He's no Indian.

963
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:37,539
He runs a barber shop, that's it.

964
01:20:42,584 --> 01:20:44,984
What will you say
about your operation now?

965
01:20:46,121 --> 01:20:47,588
I don't believe this.

966
01:20:47,689 --> 01:20:49,657
The R.A.W chief has no answers.

967
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:51,852
Mishra, you tell me. How many agents?

968
01:20:51,927 --> 01:20:54,122
According to the ISI, there were four.
- Excuse me. Just a minute.

969
01:20:54,196 --> 01:20:56,460
Ashwini, prepare a press brief now.

970
01:20:56,532 --> 01:20:58,056
And, before that...

971
01:20:58,834 --> 01:21:00,825
I want your resignation letter.

972
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:11,907
Sir.

973
01:21:14,016 --> 01:21:17,247
If they're caught in Pakistan,
we'll be embarrassed.

974
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:20,151
I can handle this.

975
01:21:22,658 --> 01:21:24,717
The situation will
be under control, madam.

976
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:30,163
'None of the Indian
government's agency...'

977
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:32,460
'...is involved in the
Pakistan hotel blast'.

978
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,431
We've been targeted
by terrorists ourselves.

979
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:42,866
And, we never encourage
such activities on foreign soil.

980
01:21:46,548 --> 01:21:49,312
'We're prepared to
give any kind of help...'

981
01:21:49,384 --> 01:21:51,477
....to the Pakistan
authorities in their probe.

982
01:21:51,587 --> 01:21:54,385
'We have found such a person...'

983
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:57,391
....who might be responsible
for this deadly blast...

984
01:21:57,492 --> 01:21:58,516
Heck!

985
01:21:59,595 --> 01:22:00,789
They just washed their
hands from everything.

986
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:03,821
Inform everyone now!

987
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:05,662
And tell them to find out everything.
All four of them.

988
01:22:05,734 --> 01:22:08,066
I want all the information.

989
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:10,001
Shakeup anyone you want.

990
01:22:10,072 --> 01:22:11,471
I'll take your questions now.

991
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:14,134
Sir...

992
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:16,677
Sir. Off the record.

993
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:19,145
This mission was to target him, right?

994
01:22:19,281 --> 01:22:21,010
Him? Who?

995
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:22,983
Sir...
- Oh! You mean him!

996
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:26,018
But, according to them he isn't there.

997
01:22:26,622 --> 01:22:28,715
And, we still don't
have the technology...

998
01:22:29,024 --> 01:22:32,892
....to attack someone who isn't there.

999
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:35,825
If they're caught and
proved that they are Indians...

1000
01:22:35,897 --> 01:22:37,524
....then what will you do?

1001
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,232
Nothing.
We have nothing to do with them.

1002
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:42,994
Thank you.

1003
01:22:45,641 --> 01:22:48,041
'Even if we believe that
R.A.W was involved in this...'

1004
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:49,543
'...what's Pakistan going to say?'

1005
01:22:49,645 --> 01:22:51,135
'As senior officer of R.A.W said...'

1006
01:22:51,246 --> 01:22:53,373
'...How can we attack someone...'

1007
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:55,245
'...who according to he
Pakistan government isn't there.'

1008
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:56,439
'Cameraman...'

1009
01:22:56,585 --> 01:22:57,916
We cannot have any official position...

1010
01:22:57,986 --> 01:23:03,185
....until we don't remove
our special guest from this issue.

1011
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:07,026
Salim. Call the General.

1012
01:23:19,908 --> 01:23:22,672
Wali, Ashwini here.
- Just a minute, sir. Please.

1013
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:24,436
Turn off the volume.

1014
01:23:25,147 --> 01:23:29,243
Sir, how did they
know about Baituz Zahab?

1015
01:23:29,318 --> 01:23:31,650
One of you must have
left a trail behind.

1016
01:23:33,021 --> 01:23:35,012
Contact Dipankar Ghosh.

1017
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:36,917
He'll get you out.

1018
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:40,026
They'll get to you soon.
- Hello.

1019
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:41,889
Hello. Sir.

1020
01:23:43,265 --> 01:23:46,428
This girl's... been staying
in the hotel for a long time.

1021
01:23:46,968 --> 01:23:49,664
All thanks to Aslam... Salim.

1022
01:23:53,175 --> 01:23:55,040
The third is Wali Khan. He's a local.

1023
01:23:55,143 --> 01:23:57,703
We got his detail while
interrogating his wife.

1024
01:23:57,979 --> 01:24:00,607
His wife and child
were flying to London.

1025
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,642
Where's the fourth one who...

1026
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:05,653
We've no information about him.

1027
01:24:06,722 --> 01:24:07,279
Napier Road.

1028
01:24:09,257 --> 01:24:10,656
The brothel.

1029
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:12,623
He was definitely a soldier.

1030
01:24:12,861 --> 01:24:14,590
His eyes were...

1031
01:24:14,696 --> 01:24:16,596
Salim. Pass me the cigarette.

1032
01:24:16,732 --> 01:24:19,132
But, you stopped smoking.
- I know I did.

1033
01:24:19,201 --> 01:24:20,293
But, I'm tensed.

1034
01:24:20,402 --> 01:24:21,699
Stopped smoking!

1035
01:24:21,803 --> 01:24:24,397
Listen, he's here to see you.

1036
01:24:24,473 --> 01:24:25,098
Who?

1037
01:24:25,207 --> 01:24:26,902
Let's postpone the wedding.

1038
01:24:27,042 --> 01:24:29,340
We're been linked to
you on every news channel.

1039
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:32,040
And we visit India frequently.

1040
01:24:32,447 --> 01:24:34,540
Don't worry.

1041
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:37,114
Everything will be fine.
- That's what you say.

1042
01:24:37,552 --> 01:24:39,918
Let's just stay quiet for few days.

1043
01:24:40,489 --> 01:24:42,480
We'll do it after a year.

1044
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:46,121
And anyway, people are
talking about you, your son.

1045
01:24:47,062 --> 01:24:48,996
My son?
- Right.

1046
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:52,229
My son!
- Yes, your son.

1047
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:54,734
Get up you swine.
- What?

1048
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:56,361
Get up! Get up!

1049
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:57,995
Rascal!

1050
01:24:59,074 --> 01:25:00,803
Put that down, and listen here.

1051
01:25:00,876 --> 01:25:03,436
You were a cricket commentator,
weren't you?

1052
01:25:03,512 --> 01:25:05,673
And, you're scared so soon.

1053
01:25:06,081 --> 01:25:09,175
I'm a fast player.
I only hit boundaries.

1054
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:10,582
I don't believe in playing slow.

1055
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:12,415
The marriage was fixed for tomorrow...

1056
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:13,927
....and, that's when its going to be.

1057
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:15,855
You dare speak against my son.

1058
01:25:15,924 --> 01:25:17,050
Salim.

1059
01:25:17,592 --> 01:25:20,584
I want everyone behind this attack.

1060
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:22,095
Leave that...
- Quiet!

1061
01:25:23,732 --> 01:25:25,063
Quiet!

1062
01:25:27,436 --> 01:25:29,700
No need to bring them alive.

1063
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:31,670
Dead bodies are okay.

1064
01:25:33,074 --> 01:25:36,237
Everyone... Everyone's after us.

1065
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:39,844
The gang and the police.

1066
01:25:42,684 --> 01:25:45,084
Wali... let's run away.

1067
01:25:45,954 --> 01:25:47,649
We can escape from the docks.

1068
01:25:47,756 --> 01:25:50,122
We cannot take a decision in haste.

1069
01:25:51,493 --> 01:25:53,051
You're just an enemy.

1070
01:25:53,728 --> 01:25:55,423
But, I am a traitor.

1071
01:25:58,467 --> 01:26:00,458
I wonder how they're going to kill me.

1072
01:26:00,569 --> 01:26:02,264
We've been asked to contact Ghosh.

1073
01:26:02,804 --> 01:26:04,431
He'll get us out of here.

1074
01:26:04,573 --> 01:26:05,904
You believe that?

1075
01:26:06,007 --> 01:26:07,668
Didn't you watch the news?

1076
01:26:08,009 --> 01:26:10,477
They said they've
nothing to do with us.

1077
01:26:10,579 --> 01:26:12,046
They won't announce it again.

1078
01:26:12,113 --> 01:26:14,081
Now we'll have to help ourselves.

1079
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:16,608
Do what, Aslam? Do what?

1080
01:26:16,685 --> 01:26:18,585
We already did.
- What?

1081
01:26:18,687 --> 01:26:20,484
What did we do?

1082
01:26:21,223 --> 01:26:22,588
I was in front of him.

1083
01:26:22,924 --> 01:26:24,414
I was about to shoot him when...

1084
01:26:25,327 --> 01:26:27,557
We would've achieved
nothing by killing him.

1085
01:26:29,431 --> 01:26:31,899
I didn't accept to
be a spy in this country...

1086
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,264
....so that I can kill him
on sight and make him a martyr.

1087
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:38,666
My dream was to drag him
out of this country, alive.

1088
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,640
And hand him over to India.

1089
01:26:41,376 --> 01:26:42,809
And that was the mission.

1090
01:26:43,245 --> 01:26:46,442
So, you became a part of
this mission to fulfil your dream.

1091
01:26:51,019 --> 01:26:52,384
I am leaving.

1092
01:26:53,855 --> 01:26:55,049
Take my advice.

1093
01:26:55,156 --> 01:26:57,215
Stay hidden for 72 hours.

1094
01:26:57,392 --> 01:27:00,919
After that, get out of the city.

1095
01:27:01,196 --> 01:27:02,527
They can get here anytime.

1096
01:27:04,299 --> 01:27:06,028
Aslam. Aslam.

1097
01:27:21,716 --> 01:27:25,208
Last time you left room,
you let the fan on.

1098
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:27,520
Next time I will charge you 100 extra.

1099
01:27:27,622 --> 01:27:29,385
Fine, you may. That's okay.

1100
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:32,125
I didn't know you all were together.

1101
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:45,531
Yes, they've made contact.

1102
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,870
They're arriving at
Empress Market at 2 o'clock.

1103
01:27:48,476 --> 01:27:49,738
I am sending my team.

1104
01:27:49,844 --> 01:27:51,812
You know what to do with the bodies.

1105
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,008
But, Mishra, are you sure
killing them is the solution?

1106
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:57,051
Send photos for the record.

1107
01:27:57,118 --> 01:27:58,415
Understood, Mishra?

1108
01:28:12,434 --> 01:28:14,163
Mishra, are you on the line.

1109
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:15,631
They're here.

1110
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:21,102
They have just come.
Moving towards Dock Point. - All four?

1111
01:28:21,209 --> 01:28:23,905
Two. A lady and a gents.

1112
01:28:24,045 --> 01:28:26,843
Oh no! They must've separated.

1113
01:28:27,983 --> 01:28:29,951
Don't fire. Wait.

1114
01:28:30,251 --> 01:28:31,411
Yes, sir.

1115
01:28:33,388 --> 01:28:35,322
Beauty Parlour.

1116
01:28:36,424 --> 01:28:37,652
That way.

1117
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:43,861
Have you seen him?

1118
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:46,493
No, no, sir.

1119
01:28:47,335 --> 01:28:48,597
Have you seen him?

1120
01:28:49,304 --> 01:28:50,635
The news further

1121
01:28:50,772 --> 01:28:54,230
All flights from Karachi
to London are still on hold.'

1122
01:28:54,342 --> 01:28:56,401
'Due to the volcanic
eruption in Iceland...'

1123
01:28:56,478 --> 01:28:59,470
'London's Heathrow Airport
has been practically closed down.'

1124
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:19,564
'There is a stampede
at the Karachi Airport.

1125
01:29:19,901 --> 01:29:23,234
'Many passengers are stuck
at the airport since morning.'

1126
01:29:23,605 --> 01:29:25,266
'And, reports are that...'

1127
01:29:25,373 --> 01:29:26,806
'...the situation isn't
going to get any better soon.'

1128
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:29,309
'Any passenger for London?
- Yes...'

1129
01:29:29,577 --> 01:29:30,703
'I've never travelled
by plane before.'

1130
01:29:30,812 --> 01:29:33,303
'They won't ask you to fly it.'

1131
01:29:34,382 --> 01:29:36,646
'You told everyone that
you're going to London.'

1132
01:29:36,785 --> 01:29:38,946
'Father. Goodbye.'

1133
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,993
'If it's a matter of few days,
why can't we go together?'

1134
01:29:49,631 --> 01:29:52,998
Wali, what happened?

1135
01:29:54,869 --> 01:29:56,029
Come on, Wali.

1136
01:29:57,806 --> 01:29:59,797
You go, I can't.
- What?

1137
01:30:01,342 --> 01:30:03,640
Now I understand why
the operation failed?

1138
01:30:04,345 --> 01:30:06,025
I've to call London.
- Where are you going?

1139
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:08,106
I've to call London.
- Listen...

1140
01:30:08,316 --> 01:30:09,476
They're moving away.

1141
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,119
Let's go back. We can be caught.

1142
01:30:13,221 --> 01:30:14,813
Nafisa and Kabir are caught, I think.

1143
01:30:14,889 --> 01:30:16,754
I've to call London.
I've to call London.

1144
01:30:16,858 --> 01:30:18,291
Listen to me.

1145
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:23,188
If they're here,
I think its best you don't see them.

1146
01:30:24,332 --> 01:30:26,493
Wali...
- Ghosh has sent us.

1147
01:30:27,535 --> 01:30:29,093
You'll have to come with us.

1148
01:30:34,876 --> 01:30:36,673
Let me make one call.

1149
01:30:36,945 --> 01:30:37,934
After that I will come with you.

1150
01:30:38,046 --> 01:30:39,775
One call.
- You can call later.

1151
01:30:41,783 --> 01:30:42,943
Stop!

1152
01:30:46,755 --> 01:30:47,414
Kill them.

1153
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:50,214
Just kill them, right now!

1154
01:30:50,825 --> 01:30:52,053
Kill them now!

1155
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:53,686
Just kill them.

1156
01:31:00,902 --> 01:31:02,028
Hello!

1157
01:31:04,773 --> 01:31:06,968
They're evidence. Just kill them.

1158
01:31:08,877 --> 01:31:09,775
Hello.

1159
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:12,307
Don't leave them.

1160
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:14,408
Wali, lets go.
- Come on.

1161
01:31:14,582 --> 01:31:16,174
Wali, let's go.
- Hello. Hello.

1162
01:31:16,251 --> 01:31:17,131
Let's get out of here.

1163
01:31:17,152 --> 01:31:22,454
We risked everything for you.
- Wali, let's go.

1164
01:31:26,694 --> 01:31:28,286
Let's go.

1165
01:33:31,319 --> 01:33:36,882
I wonder how...
these moments shattered...

1166
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:39,825
....like a broken relationship.

1167
01:33:43,965 --> 01:33:49,631
Just like... these moment's brimmed...

1168
01:33:49,704 --> 01:33:52,434
....from the cup of sorrows.

1169
01:33:55,710 --> 01:34:00,613
Why's this story incomplete?

1170
01:34:02,116 --> 01:34:07,019
Why's this saga incomplete?

1171
01:34:08,489 --> 01:34:16,055
Why is its fate... farewell?

1172
01:34:22,603 --> 01:34:31,341
Love doesn't have... to be eternal.

1173
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:44,054
A moment of sacrifice... is love too.

1174
01:34:46,894 --> 01:34:51,957
This story isn't incomplete.

1175
01:34:53,301 --> 01:34:58,261
This saga isn't incomplete.

1176
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:07,706
Even after I die...
I won't say farewell.

1177
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:22,092
Desires remain unquenched.

1178
01:35:26,534 --> 01:35:34,771
Though far,
but you're close to my heart.

1179
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:43,278
Because you're my story.

1180
01:35:44,452 --> 01:35:49,446
Because you're my saga.

1181
01:35:50,892 --> 01:35:58,992
Never say again... farewell.

1182
01:36:11,312 --> 01:36:15,214
I cherish your memories.

1183
01:36:15,283 --> 01:36:17,683
Don't say it.

1184
01:36:17,785 --> 01:36:22,222
They make me and break me.

1185
01:36:24,025 --> 01:36:28,428
The world you're lost in...
- Now it's better.

1186
01:36:29,063 --> 01:36:32,328
....lacks everything.

1187
01:36:32,433 --> 01:36:37,268
The sorrow of bitter loneliness.

1188
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:44,904
Beloved...

1189
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:51,275
Why did this happen?

1190
01:36:51,519 --> 01:36:54,044
Don't be so cruel.

1191
01:36:54,122 --> 01:36:57,250
Don't be so cruel.

1192
01:36:58,059 --> 01:37:04,828
It's the story of two hearts.

1193
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:11,195
I wonder how...
these moment's shattered...

1194
01:37:11,272 --> 01:37:14,435
....like a broken relationship.

1195
01:37:14,509 --> 01:37:18,070
Don't say it.

1196
01:37:18,446 --> 01:37:23,907
Just like... these moment's brimmed...

1197
01:37:24,018 --> 01:37:27,215
....from the cup of sorrows.

1198
01:37:27,388 --> 01:37:30,016
Farewell.

1199
01:37:30,091 --> 01:37:35,586
Why's this story incomplete?

1200
01:37:49,076 --> 01:37:51,044
Farewell.

1201
01:38:13,668 --> 01:38:16,364
Brother. Rudra asked me to see you.

1202
01:38:16,871 --> 01:38:19,305
He said I'll get
a boat for India here.

1203
01:38:23,744 --> 01:38:24,870
Brother...

1204
01:38:27,949 --> 01:38:31,282
There's delay.... but not denial.

1205
01:38:32,486 --> 01:38:33,578
Right?

1206
01:38:36,157 --> 01:38:37,920
Aslam, take left.

1207
01:38:37,992 --> 01:38:39,892
Aslam, take left.

1208
01:38:41,696 --> 01:38:43,687
You must be laughing on us, right?

1209
01:38:43,764 --> 01:38:45,561
Didn't you?

1210
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,061
Tell us where are the others?

1211
01:38:48,936 --> 01:38:51,268
You don't have all night.

1212
01:38:52,773 --> 01:38:58,143
Deepankar Ghosh.
Wali, Zoya will contact him.

1213
01:38:58,212 --> 01:39:01,079
Don't know.... about Rudra.

1214
01:39:01,148 --> 01:39:05,517
He's gone.
- Swine...

1215
01:39:07,054 --> 01:39:09,420
Nephew. Let him go.

1216
01:41:35,536 --> 01:41:37,527
This is Karachi.

1217
01:41:37,605 --> 01:41:39,038
I will find you and kill you.

1218
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:41,267
Leave me, leave me today.
- Forgive me.

1219
01:41:41,909 --> 01:41:43,103
Leave me...

1220
01:41:56,624 --> 01:41:58,615
You've always had this bad habit.

1221
01:41:58,759 --> 01:42:02,024
Now they will have
to clean up your mess.

1222
01:42:02,129 --> 01:42:05,724
If you were so obsessed,
you should've finished the job.

1223
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,734
You should've slit the throat...

1224
01:42:07,802 --> 01:42:11,397
....of that man who put
a gun to your uncle's forehead.

1225
01:42:12,606 --> 01:42:13,538
Apologise now!

1226
01:42:13,607 --> 01:42:14,938
The situation outside
Empress Market is...

1227
01:42:15,009 --> 01:42:16,374
Niyaz.

1228
01:42:16,744 --> 01:42:18,143
He's apologizing.

1229
01:42:22,850 --> 01:42:24,044
Sorry.

1230
01:42:37,031 --> 01:42:38,931
Take an appointment with the chief.

1231
01:42:40,267 --> 01:42:41,859
Enough of their drama.

1232
01:42:41,969 --> 01:42:45,632
What about Wali
Khan's wife and child...

1233
01:43:30,985 --> 01:43:33,545
Wretched dog!

1234
01:43:38,826 --> 01:43:40,054
Rudra...

1235
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,559
What.... happened?

1236
01:43:41,862 --> 01:43:43,591
They knew about Aslam.

1237
01:43:44,398 --> 01:43:45,729
He's in a terrible condition.

1238
01:43:45,799 --> 01:43:47,096
Look after him.

1239
01:43:47,401 --> 01:43:50,734
And get out of here by morning.
- Rudra.

1240
01:43:52,139 --> 01:43:57,270
We know.... why our mission failed?

1241
01:44:01,215 --> 01:44:05,117
A five year old boy
Kabir survived this blast.

1242
01:44:05,386 --> 01:44:08,583
His mother passed away in the attack.
- They're lying.

1243
01:44:08,689 --> 01:44:10,714
And, the agencies are now...

1244
01:44:10,791 --> 01:44:13,157
....looking for his
father or any other kin.

1245
01:44:15,496 --> 01:44:17,964
If anyone has any information...

1246
01:44:18,032 --> 01:44:21,763
....please contact us on
the number appearing below.

1247
01:44:28,042 --> 01:44:29,805
How did they kill her?

1248
01:44:46,026 --> 01:44:48,051
Get some sleep, Ashwini.

1249
01:44:48,162 --> 01:44:49,925
It's quite late.

1250
01:44:51,732 --> 01:44:55,634
Yes. it is.

1251
01:45:04,478 --> 01:45:06,309
The boy's sweater.

1252
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:25,563
My son's sweater.

1253
01:45:33,107 --> 01:45:34,506
20 days.

1254
01:45:36,844 --> 01:45:41,213
20 days.... and,
things went from right to wrong.

1255
01:45:46,153 --> 01:45:52,217
If he leaves,
then our sacrifices will be useless.

1256
01:45:52,326 --> 01:46:04,705
The henna....
on my hands is still visible.

1257
01:46:07,074 --> 01:46:08,473
What was her name?

1258
01:46:08,542 --> 01:46:17,780
Wait a moment...

1259
01:46:19,553 --> 01:46:20,918
Didn't ask.

1260
01:46:20,988 --> 01:46:33,958
Your lips still have
my essence on them.

1261
01:46:34,034 --> 01:46:35,296
Rudra.

1262
01:46:36,937 --> 01:46:38,564
Stop Wali.

1263
01:46:57,024 --> 01:46:58,321
Where are you going?

1264
01:47:01,662 --> 01:47:03,653
You cannot be so selfish.

1265
01:47:03,997 --> 01:47:05,988
We've all made sacrifices.

1266
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:09,135
I'm not in a state
to understand your pain.

1267
01:47:10,771 --> 01:47:12,261
I am going.
- Wali.

1268
01:47:13,373 --> 01:47:15,534
The mission's failed.

1269
01:47:17,144 --> 01:47:18,509
India has severed ties with us...

1270
01:47:18,579 --> 01:47:20,945
....as if we were never one of them.

1271
01:47:21,115 --> 01:47:23,515
We cannot survive in Pakistan.

1272
01:47:23,584 --> 01:47:25,745
Everything's over.
- But...

1273
01:47:25,819 --> 01:47:27,377
My child's waiting.

1274
01:47:27,488 --> 01:47:29,217
I want to meet him.

1275
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:30,787
How will you?

1276
01:47:33,227 --> 01:47:34,694
Do you know where he is?

1277
01:47:36,396 --> 01:47:39,297
Do you know what they'll
do to you if you're caught?

1278
01:47:41,935 --> 01:47:43,835
Doesn't make a difference.

1279
01:47:44,538 --> 01:47:46,597
They killed Nafisa.

1280
01:47:49,309 --> 01:47:52,176
I can't even apologise to her now.

1281
01:47:54,948 --> 01:47:57,382
My child's waiting for me.
I want to see him.

1282
01:47:57,451 --> 01:47:59,544
I bought a sweater for him,
but can't find it.

1283
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:01,349
They killed Nafisa.

1284
01:48:02,189 --> 01:48:05,522
They might be lying about Kabir.

1285
01:48:09,329 --> 01:48:10,796
Don't let their death go waste.

1286
01:48:11,165 --> 01:48:17,104
Wali. Think about....
finishing the mission we started.

1287
01:48:38,725 --> 01:48:40,693
Enough hospitality.

1288
01:48:42,563 --> 01:48:45,191
America's still taunting
us for Abetobad.

1289
01:48:46,934 --> 01:48:50,199
If they see him partying around...

1290
01:48:50,771 --> 01:48:54,332
....the world will laugh on us.

1291
01:48:55,442 --> 01:48:58,969
Now is the time to clean up.

1292
01:48:59,246 --> 01:49:03,444
We should reject our strategy...

1293
01:49:04,151 --> 01:49:07,177
....that 'The enemy
of my enemy is a friend'.

1294
01:49:09,790 --> 01:49:13,521
Because, termites....
are termites after all.

1295
01:49:15,729 --> 01:49:18,994
Till now it was them, but now it's us.

1296
01:49:19,399 --> 01:49:23,301
But, how are we going to clean it up?

1297
01:49:23,470 --> 01:49:30,103
We've promised to take
him to a ISI safe house in Sind.

1298
01:49:30,811 --> 01:49:31,800
After the wedding.

1299
01:49:31,912 --> 01:49:34,380
So, after the wedding.

1300
01:49:35,949 --> 01:49:37,974
En route to the safe house.

1301
01:49:51,899 --> 01:49:53,958
This is the house.

1302
01:49:54,635 --> 01:49:57,399
This is us. We've to get there.

1303
01:49:57,504 --> 01:49:58,732
The wedding's going on inside.

1304
01:49:58,805 --> 01:50:00,295
And we're in this car.

1305
01:50:00,374 --> 01:50:02,001
I'm driving the car.

1306
01:50:02,142 --> 01:50:03,700
Zoya's besides me.

1307
01:50:04,444 --> 01:50:06,139
And Rudra's at the back.

1308
01:50:06,213 --> 01:50:08,943
I think Zoya should drive.

1309
01:50:09,116 --> 01:50:10,237
She's the explosives expert.

1310
01:50:10,317 --> 01:50:12,251
She has to get to the fourth quadrant.

1311
01:50:12,352 --> 01:50:14,320
You can sit at the passenger's
seat with the bouquet.

1312
01:50:14,388 --> 01:50:15,582
I'll hide at the back.

1313
01:50:15,656 --> 01:50:18,124
And, we can easily
give her cover-fire.

1314
01:50:18,859 --> 01:50:20,121
Okay.

1315
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,850
Aslam's in the car behind.

1316
01:50:21,962 --> 01:50:24,863
And.... keep a safe distance.

1317
01:50:24,965 --> 01:50:28,799
Aslam, fill the car with
as many LPG cylinders you can.

1318
01:50:29,002 --> 01:50:31,266
And, I'll rig them with semtex.

1319
01:50:31,338 --> 01:50:33,431
None of the guests should survive.

1320
01:50:34,141 --> 01:50:36,166
As soon as this car moves forward...

1321
01:50:36,977 --> 01:50:38,257
....the guards will step forward.

1322
01:50:38,345 --> 01:50:40,472
I'll get down and attack them.

1323
01:50:43,016 --> 01:50:45,246
And Rudra, will attack these guards.

1324
01:50:46,453 --> 01:50:47,750
It'll create panic.

1325
01:50:47,821 --> 01:50:50,813
Taking advantage, Zoya will
make it to the second quadrant.

1326
01:50:50,891 --> 01:50:54,383
What if....
I am shot at the second quadrant?

1327
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:57,589
Zoya, if you're shot
the mission will be over.

1328
01:50:58,031 --> 01:51:00,261
So, to create a diversion...

1329
01:51:00,334 --> 01:51:03,132
....Wali and I will
give you cover-fire.

1330
01:51:03,971 --> 01:51:07,372
At any cost, you've to get
the car at the third quadrant.

1331
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:13,240
By the time you get here,
we'll be here.

1332
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:15,610
We just need to tackle them.

1333
01:51:16,817 --> 01:51:19,115
But.... we'll be in the line of fire...

1334
01:51:19,186 --> 01:51:21,211
....so maybe we can get shot.

1335
01:51:22,823 --> 01:51:25,587
After that,
Rudra might not survive either.

1336
01:51:36,169 --> 01:51:38,160
Zoya, as soon as you
cross third quadrant...

1337
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:41,139
....tie your foot to the
accelerator with the air latchet.

1338
01:51:41,441 --> 01:51:42,806
So that it stays firm.

1339
01:51:42,876 --> 01:51:45,845
Latch the steering-wheel
as well so it doesn't move.

1340
01:51:46,179 --> 01:51:48,739
After that I'll use
the dead-man's switch.

1341
01:51:48,882 --> 01:51:52,409
After crossing the third quadrant,
I'll remove the pin.

1342
01:51:53,053 --> 01:51:55,283
Even if I'm shot...

1343
01:51:56,823 --> 01:51:59,223
After reaching the fourth quadrant...

1344
01:52:00,027 --> 01:52:01,824
....there will be a blast.

1345
01:52:03,463 --> 01:52:04,930
And, after the blast...

1346
01:52:04,998 --> 01:52:08,695
....Aslam, you'll barge
in the house with the car.

1347
01:52:08,769 --> 01:52:10,202
And then 'Boom'.

1348
01:52:11,004 --> 01:52:12,301
Diwali in Karachi!

1349
01:52:42,536 --> 01:52:43,525
I accept.

1350
01:52:43,937 --> 01:52:45,404
Amin.

1351
01:52:56,516 --> 01:52:57,949
Iqbal.

1352
01:53:01,088 --> 01:53:03,056
We should head to the safe-house now.

1353
01:53:19,372 --> 01:53:21,412
Bring your nephew along.
- Yes, give to the nephew...

1354
01:53:21,508 --> 01:53:22,497
Nephew.

1355
01:53:22,576 --> 01:53:23,406
Nephew.

1356
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:24,943
Get in the car.

1357
01:53:25,412 --> 01:53:26,504
Bye.

1358
01:54:19,366 --> 01:54:20,697
Nephew, are you crazy?

1359
01:54:20,767 --> 01:54:22,894
Calm down.
- I've been trying to call you...

1360
01:54:22,969 --> 01:54:25,267
I called because
you gave me a miss call.

1361
01:54:26,173 --> 01:54:27,731
He won't make it to the safe-house.

1362
01:54:27,807 --> 01:54:29,900
We'll kill him on the way.

1363
01:54:34,114 --> 01:54:36,048
Orders directly from Islamabad.

1364
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:37,582
Your uncle isn't listening to anyone...

1365
01:54:37,651 --> 01:54:38,851
....so we're getting rid of him.

1366
01:54:38,852 --> 01:54:40,615
I cannot do anything.

1367
01:54:41,755 --> 01:54:43,780
I'm with uncle right now.
I cannot do anything.

1368
01:54:43,857 --> 01:54:45,586
You don't understand.

1369
01:54:45,659 --> 01:54:47,126
Then ask Salim...

1370
01:54:47,194 --> 01:54:48,627
Salim's phone is switched off.

1371
01:54:48,728 --> 01:54:50,457
He must be free now.

1372
01:54:51,865 --> 01:54:53,765
I'm sending you the number.

1373
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,592
I'm sending you the number.

1374
01:54:55,735 --> 01:54:56,997
Goodbye.

1375
01:54:59,773 --> 01:55:01,001
Nothing, uncle.

1376
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:24,724
By the way, your safe-house
are falling below standard...

1377
01:55:24,798 --> 01:55:28,564
Why you...
- Forget it, nephew.

1378
01:55:29,603 --> 01:55:34,131
This is their country after all.

1379
01:56:09,509 --> 01:56:15,072
Thankfully,
you waited until my son's wedding.

1380
01:56:16,283 --> 01:56:20,879
What to do?
After all we are old friends.

1381
01:56:20,954 --> 01:56:22,683
Thank you.

1382
01:56:23,290 --> 01:56:26,350
Was I supposed to die so easily?

1383
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:28,887
No bang...

1384
01:56:29,396 --> 01:56:34,163
General. You're no better
than the Mumbai Police.

1385
01:56:34,367 --> 01:56:37,359
Trying to bump me off
in a ordinary encounter...

1386
01:56:37,537 --> 01:56:40,131
Anyway, better get on
with it quickly, General.

1387
01:56:40,573 --> 01:56:43,098
Because as far as I know my nephew...

1388
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:47,947
....he must have messaged
Salim and called him here.

1389
01:56:48,014 --> 01:56:49,504
Then you can...

1390
01:57:11,271 --> 01:57:12,932
Cover Rudra.

1391
01:57:13,006 --> 01:57:15,497
Wretched animal! Wretched traitor!

1392
01:57:15,575 --> 01:57:17,543
Wretched...

1393
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:20,943
They are not his men.

1394
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:35,691
Wretched traitor!

1395
01:57:39,766 --> 01:57:40,926
Rudra!

1396
01:58:24,411 --> 01:58:27,312
Shoot him. General, shoot him!

1397
01:58:30,784 --> 01:58:32,615
Aslam. Aslam, fire.

1398
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:34,914
Shoot him.
- Aslam, what are you doing?

1399
01:58:34,988 --> 01:58:36,751
Rudra doesn't have the bullets.

1400
01:58:36,956 --> 01:58:38,821
Aslam, what...

1401
01:58:38,925 --> 01:58:40,153
Aslam.

1402
01:58:40,427 --> 01:58:42,418
Guns won't settle this.

1403
01:58:42,529 --> 01:58:43,894
Aslam.

1404
02:00:01,641 --> 02:00:04,235
Sir. We got him.

1405
02:00:05,178 --> 02:00:07,169
And, alive.

1406
02:00:07,747 --> 02:00:09,908
He's sitting right next to us.

1407
02:00:31,070 --> 02:00:34,164
Where are you?
- We're on the outskirts of Karachi.

1408
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:35,366
Towards Sind.

1409
02:00:35,475 --> 02:00:36,669
Head towards Rann of Kutch.

1410
02:00:37,210 --> 02:00:39,542
It's impossible to escape
through Rann of Kutch.

1411
02:00:39,612 --> 02:00:40,772
I know.

1412
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:42,560
That's why no one will be suspicious.

1413
02:00:42,715 --> 02:00:44,546
We'll need the coordinates.

1414
02:00:44,617 --> 02:00:46,414
You'll have the
coordinates in two hours.

1415
02:00:54,027 --> 02:00:55,221
Where are we going?

1416
02:00:55,328 --> 02:00:57,569
According to my estimate
it is somewhere near the border.

1417
02:00:57,664 --> 02:00:59,598
Somewhere.... somewhere in Sind.

1418
02:00:59,699 --> 02:01:01,326
Stop the car.
- Let's take a look.

1419
02:01:06,839 --> 02:01:11,242
You must have heard about
Sind in your national anthem.

1420
02:01:12,045 --> 02:01:15,037
Do you have a clue
about where you're heading?

1421
02:01:15,114 --> 02:01:16,945
Shut up!

1422
02:01:18,985 --> 02:01:22,318
By the way, who is the boss?

1423
02:01:23,289 --> 02:01:24,551
Him or you?

1424
02:01:25,892 --> 02:01:28,690
He's a soldier.

1425
02:01:29,128 --> 02:01:31,096
He uses more brawn than his brain.

1426
02:01:33,366 --> 02:01:35,425
You seem smart.

1427
02:01:35,902 --> 02:01:37,267
Let's talk.

1428
02:01:38,338 --> 02:01:41,671
I want to make a call.

1429
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:47,475
Why?
- We abducted you twice.

1430
02:01:48,748 --> 02:01:50,748
Do you think anyone here
will make a deal with you?

1431
02:01:51,718 --> 02:01:53,618
Everyone has a price.

1432
02:01:53,953 --> 02:01:57,081
For some its wealth,
and for others its emotion.

1433
02:01:58,091 --> 02:01:59,615
Take you for instance.

1434
02:02:00,326 --> 02:02:02,556
You'll change sides if I say...

1435
02:02:02,662 --> 02:02:04,562
....I can let you speak to your family.

1436
02:02:05,865 --> 02:02:08,766
I told you to shut up.

1437
02:02:13,806 --> 02:02:14,864
Wali.
- Wali.

1438
02:02:16,075 --> 02:02:17,042
Come out.

1439
02:02:17,143 --> 02:02:18,337
Wali!

1440
02:02:19,979 --> 02:02:22,447
Wali, what are you doing?
- Hold on.

1441
02:02:22,782 --> 02:02:26,718
If this is a lie,
I swear I will shoot you.

1442
02:02:26,786 --> 02:02:29,016
Wali, don't listen to him.
He's lying.

1443
02:02:29,088 --> 02:02:31,147
I told you to shut up.

1444
02:02:31,257 --> 02:02:32,815
Otherwise...
- Otherwise what?

1445
02:02:32,892 --> 02:02:35,759
I will shoot you.
- You think I am a fool.

1446
02:02:35,962 --> 02:02:38,055
You want me alive.

1447
02:02:38,631 --> 02:02:41,259
This guy.
He'll take a medal and retire.

1448
02:02:41,367 --> 02:02:42,664
But what about you?

1449
02:02:42,802 --> 02:02:43,928
Can you live?

1450
02:02:44,871 --> 02:02:46,964
Can you live after
sacrificing your family?

1451
02:02:47,073 --> 02:02:48,438
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1452
02:02:48,508 --> 02:02:50,772
He's lying.
- I am lying?

1453
02:02:50,910 --> 02:02:52,309
I am lying?

1454
02:02:52,478 --> 02:02:54,198
Your family was travelling
to London, right.

1455
02:02:54,347 --> 02:02:55,371
Wali.
- How do I know?

1456
02:02:55,481 --> 02:02:57,381
I know... Okay, do one thing.

1457
02:02:57,483 --> 02:02:59,144
I...
- Call up Salim.

1458
02:02:59,352 --> 02:03:00,410
Wali.
- Do it yourself.

1459
02:03:00,486 --> 02:03:02,579
Tell him that brother's with me...

1460
02:03:02,655 --> 02:03:04,088
....and let you speak to your wife.

1461
02:03:04,157 --> 02:03:05,677
My wife's alive.
- I am saying she is...

1462
02:03:05,725 --> 02:03:07,386
Wali, don't listen to him.
- Hold on.

1463
02:03:07,493 --> 02:03:08,926
Dial the number.
- Wali, he's lying.

1464
02:03:09,028 --> 02:03:10,290
They're dead.
- Hold on.

1465
02:03:10,363 --> 02:03:12,331
Dial now. Dial it. Dial the number.

1466
02:03:12,398 --> 02:03:14,423
92319.... I assure you.

1467
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:18,197
Dial 9231981500 dial it.

1468
02:03:18,304 --> 02:03:19,828
Dial it yourself. 93...
- No!

1469
02:03:19,939 --> 02:03:20,899
Return the phone.
- Wali.

1470
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:22,237
Return the phone.
- Return the phone.

1471
02:03:22,308 --> 02:03:23,570
No, Wali.
- Just once.

1472
02:03:23,676 --> 02:03:25,439
Don't listen to him. He's lying.

1473
02:03:25,511 --> 02:03:27,342
Return the phone.
- He's lying.

1474
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:28,947
Return the phone.
- He's lying, they're dead.

1475
02:03:29,015 --> 02:03:30,949
Let me talk to them.
- If you want the phone shoot me.

1476
02:03:31,017 --> 02:03:32,951
Let me talk to them...
- If you want the phone shoot me.

1477
02:03:33,052 --> 02:03:34,576
Let me speak to them.
- Give him the phone.

1478
02:03:34,654 --> 02:03:35,552
Let me speak to them.

1479
02:03:35,655 --> 02:03:36,644
If you want the phone shoot me, Wali.

1480
02:03:36,756 --> 02:03:37,916
Let me speak to them.

1481
02:03:38,024 --> 02:03:39,958
If you want the phone shoot me, Wali.

1482
02:04:05,952 --> 02:04:09,649
Zoya, will he survive or not?

1483
02:04:10,823 --> 02:04:12,222
He's lost a lot of blood.

1484
02:04:12,792 --> 02:04:14,521
We need to take him to a hospital.

1485
02:04:27,106 --> 02:04:28,368
Zoya.

1486
02:04:32,578 --> 02:04:33,840
Have you gone crazy?

1487
02:04:33,913 --> 02:04:36,677
He himself doesn't know which
side he's on, ours or theirs.

1488
02:04:36,749 --> 02:04:38,478
How far is the border?

1489
02:04:38,885 --> 02:04:40,113
3 hours.

1490
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:45,086
He's making us dance with bullets,
and we are dancing.

1491
02:04:45,158 --> 02:04:46,853
He is out of his mind.

1492
02:04:55,301 --> 02:04:58,202
I only injured him,
next time I'll shoot to kill.

1493
02:05:04,443 --> 02:05:08,573
For the last time,
tell him Ashwini's here.

1494
02:05:08,748 --> 02:05:10,147
Sir, he's the BSF chief.

1495
02:05:10,249 --> 02:05:12,217
I cannot wake him at this hour.

1496
02:05:12,285 --> 02:05:14,253
For any emergency. Driver...

1497
02:05:14,387 --> 02:05:17,049
If you don't call him in 10 seconds...

1498
02:05:17,123 --> 02:05:20,149
....you won't be able
to explain the emergency.

1499
02:05:21,093 --> 02:05:22,287
Please.

1500
02:05:35,508 --> 02:05:39,239
Aren't you going to call?
- I'll tell you when.

1501
02:05:42,148 --> 02:05:45,447
All this trouble for nothing.

1502
02:05:47,186 --> 02:05:51,486
The Indian government
says you're not one of them.

1503
02:05:52,859 --> 02:05:56,158
And here you're putting
your life at stake.

1504
02:05:57,597 --> 02:06:00,930
Anyway, you like to risk your life.

1505
02:06:01,801 --> 02:06:04,736
But, what's your son's fault?

1506
02:06:09,942 --> 02:06:11,204
Look.

1507
02:06:12,144 --> 02:06:14,612
I know how dear sons are.

1508
02:06:16,115 --> 02:06:20,347
As a kid,
my son would never stay away from me.

1509
02:06:21,487 --> 02:06:24,285
But, when he was old enough
to read the newspapers...

1510
02:06:24,924 --> 02:06:28,087
....he realised what his father does.

1511
02:06:29,061 --> 02:06:33,361
Then, there was always
this question in his eyes, Why.

1512
02:06:34,734 --> 02:06:36,065
Why?

1513
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:40,402
That's what you will
have to face as well.

1514
02:06:40,773 --> 02:06:43,833
You'll be branded with it.

1515
02:06:44,577 --> 02:06:47,478
There's a vast difference
between you and me.

1516
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:51,077
But for our children, we're the same.

1517
02:06:53,085 --> 02:06:54,347
Think.

1518
02:07:03,396 --> 02:07:06,854
Tell them,
I want to talk to Kabir in two hours.

1519
02:07:07,867 --> 02:07:09,994
You are doing the right thing, Wali.

1520
02:07:15,975 --> 02:07:21,436
The no's 9231981500.

1521
02:07:21,614 --> 02:07:25,050
9231981500...

1522
02:07:25,117 --> 02:07:26,311
Help them cross the border?

1523
02:07:26,852 --> 02:07:27,614
Have you lost it.

1524
02:07:27,687 --> 02:07:31,487
Ashwini,
we cannot decide that. - Why...

1525
02:07:34,493 --> 02:07:35,755
Why not?

1526
02:07:36,829 --> 02:07:40,060
The government always
turns their other cheek.

1527
02:07:40,132 --> 02:07:41,963
But, people like us face the blow.

1528
02:07:42,068 --> 02:07:44,161
Zhaveri Bazaar,
German Bakery, Parliament House...

1529
02:07:44,270 --> 02:07:46,704
....Bangalore, Hyderabad...
This goes on and on.

1530
02:07:46,772 --> 02:07:48,239
We've to stop it.

1531
02:07:50,843 --> 02:07:54,574
Shorabjit.
I am not saying anything new.

1532
02:07:54,914 --> 02:07:56,347
Everyone knows everything.

1533
02:07:56,449 --> 02:07:58,917
But, no one's doing anything.

1534
02:07:59,151 --> 02:08:00,584
One operation...

1535
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:04,455
One such operation succeeds...

1536
02:08:04,623 --> 02:08:07,387
....and no one will dare to do it again.

1537
02:08:09,762 --> 02:08:13,459
The real enemy are not
those who cause destruction.

1538
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,831
We should clip the hands of those...

1539
02:08:15,901 --> 02:08:18,699
....who supply them bombs and guns.

1540
02:08:19,305 --> 02:08:23,002
You know very well. He's the guy.

1541
02:08:32,118 --> 02:08:33,676
What do you want from me?

1542
02:08:58,878 --> 02:09:00,175
Kabir.

1543
02:09:01,414 --> 02:09:03,211
You were thinking about Kabir, right?

1544
02:09:03,482 --> 02:09:04,642
Wali.

1545
02:09:12,958 --> 02:09:16,826
Wali, Ashwini here.
I have spoken to everyone. - Yes, sir.

1546
02:09:16,896 --> 02:09:18,659
It is only a 15 minute window.

1547
02:09:18,731 --> 02:09:20,028
I got it, sir.

1548
02:09:20,232 --> 02:09:22,700
At dawn. Before 6 o'clock.

1549
02:09:22,768 --> 02:09:25,430
On Section post 35.
- South post 35, sir.

1550
02:09:25,538 --> 02:09:27,267
I get it.
- Bring him from there.

1551
02:09:27,339 --> 02:09:28,533
Yes, sir.

1552
02:09:30,409 --> 02:09:31,876
That was Ashwini sir.

1553
02:09:31,944 --> 02:09:33,309
We've to be there by 6 am.

1554
02:09:33,379 --> 02:09:35,040
It's around 150 kilometres from here.

1555
02:09:35,147 --> 02:09:36,774
We'll cross the border when...

1556
02:09:36,882 --> 02:09:38,679
....the guards change
shift at the outpost.

1557
02:09:38,751 --> 02:09:40,912
I am not going anywhere.

1558
02:09:42,288 --> 02:09:44,051
I'll die right here if I want to.

1559
02:09:44,957 --> 02:09:46,356
I won't die by their hands.

1560
02:09:46,459 --> 02:09:50,418
Sir's already made arrangements.
We'll slip through outpost 35.

1561
02:09:50,896 --> 02:09:52,864
We'll hand him over
to his people and get out.

1562
02:09:52,965 --> 02:09:55,525
Don't be a fool, Wali.

1563
02:09:56,502 --> 02:09:58,697
Maybe outpost 35 has been prepped.

1564
02:09:58,871 --> 02:09:59,963
But, do you know...

1565
02:10:00,072 --> 02:10:02,336
....5 kilometres from
here is section 40.

1566
02:10:02,608 --> 02:10:04,508
And, they have two
huge units out there.

1567
02:10:04,877 --> 02:10:06,174
You think....

1568
02:10:06,245 --> 02:10:09,214
they'll release Nafisa
and Kabir for him.

1569
02:10:09,949 --> 02:10:12,645
They were going to kill him!
We saved him.

1570
02:10:12,718 --> 02:10:15,983
They'll be here in 5 minutes.

1571
02:10:18,624 --> 02:10:19,784
Look, Wali...

1572
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:25,357
Father.
- Kabir. My son.

1573
02:10:25,464 --> 02:10:28,228
Son. Where's mom?

1574
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:30,393
Mom's in the other room.

1575
02:10:30,503 --> 02:10:32,562
She's talking to officer uncle.

1576
02:10:33,572 --> 02:10:35,699
Are you coming to pick us up?

1577
02:10:38,711 --> 02:10:40,611
Yes, son. I am.

1578
02:10:40,746 --> 02:10:42,338
Are you coming on the bike?

1579
02:10:44,917 --> 02:10:48,148
Yes, son.
I'll pick you up on the bike.

1580
02:10:48,454 --> 02:10:51,082
On a white bike. it's big bike.

1581
02:10:51,157 --> 02:10:52,749
It has three seats.

1582
02:10:52,825 --> 02:10:55,123
And, we'll go on a long ride.

1583
02:10:55,427 --> 02:10:58,191
Is uncle around?

1584
02:10:58,264 --> 02:11:00,164
Yes. Uncle's right here.

1585
02:11:00,232 --> 02:11:03,690
I'll ask him to arrange for the bike.
Let me speak to him.

1586
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:18,141
Bring Nafisa and Kabir at section 40.

1587
02:11:19,552 --> 02:11:21,543
You'll get your man back.

1588
02:11:21,654 --> 02:11:23,019
Before 6 am.

1589
02:11:26,725 --> 02:11:29,558
Loyalty or business.

1590
02:11:30,829 --> 02:11:32,694
Choose now, Salim.

1591
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:35,929
I'm through with loyalty.

1592
02:11:40,139 --> 02:11:41,970
Then kill the Goldman.

1593
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:49,575
You know what's going to happen...

1594
02:11:49,682 --> 02:11:51,343
....yet you want to do this.

1595
02:11:52,718 --> 02:11:55,209
This is the only
way to finish the job.

1596
02:11:55,754 --> 02:11:57,779
You said I started all this.

1597
02:11:58,757 --> 02:12:00,315
So, I am going to finish it.

1598
02:12:01,527 --> 02:12:03,256
Sit down!
- Wali, where are you going?

1599
02:12:03,329 --> 02:12:04,921
Where are you going?

1600
02:12:05,097 --> 02:12:06,894
We've all made sacrifices.

1601
02:12:10,569 --> 02:12:12,036
Zoya, untie me.

1602
02:12:14,707 --> 02:12:17,267
Quick.
- Hold on. Where are you going?

1603
02:12:17,343 --> 02:12:18,935
Come here. Come.

1604
02:12:21,447 --> 02:12:23,381
What?
- Look here.

1605
02:12:24,683 --> 02:12:27,777
Here?
- You asked who the boss is.

1606
02:12:28,053 --> 02:12:29,315
So, come on.

1607
02:12:52,278 --> 02:12:59,184
No more string of memories.

1608
02:13:00,052 --> 02:13:06,981
Not a strand of my existence.

1609
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:11,896
Why did the earth forget them?

1610
02:13:12,498 --> 02:13:15,865
Why did the heaven forget them?

1611
02:13:16,402 --> 02:13:22,568
I wonder where they're lost.

1612
02:13:23,575 --> 02:13:30,572
Those who weaved
dreams with their blood.

1613
02:13:31,450 --> 02:13:38,618
And, their obsession paved new ways.

1614
02:13:39,992 --> 02:13:43,359
Why did the earth forget them?

1615
02:13:44,029 --> 02:13:47,294
Why did the heaven forget them?

1616
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:54,237
I wonder where they're lost.

1617
02:14:02,548 --> 02:14:10,455
Even the stars couldn't
give them refuge.

1618
02:14:10,522 --> 02:14:18,429
It's the story,
both worlds overlooked.

1619
02:14:18,731 --> 02:14:24,692
The ones we turned to smoke.

1620
02:14:26,205 --> 02:14:34,169
Why did we turn them to smoke?

1621
02:14:34,246 --> 02:14:37,807
Why did we turn them...
- Fire!

1622
02:14:54,066 --> 02:15:01,063
Those who only give, and never ask.

1623
02:15:01,940 --> 02:15:08,903
We've created this
ambiance by robbing them.

1624
02:15:10,549 --> 02:15:13,677
If the earth forgets them?

1625
02:15:14,453 --> 02:15:17,980
If the heaven forgets them?

1626
02:15:18,424 --> 02:15:24,124
We'll never sing again.

1627
02:15:25,030 --> 02:15:33,165
Even the stars couldn't
give them refuge.

1628
02:15:33,238 --> 02:15:40,974
It's the story,
both worlds overlooked.

1629
02:15:41,313 --> 02:15:47,548
The ones we turned to smoke.

1630
02:16:05,537 --> 02:16:06,663
'I accept.'

1631
02:17:57,950 --> 02:17:59,850
it's Goldman!
- Open.

1632
02:18:03,121 --> 02:18:05,749
'Family. Friendship. Emotions.'

1633
02:18:06,158 --> 02:18:08,388
'Wali Khan had every weakness.'

1634
02:18:08,794 --> 02:18:10,261
'But when the time came...'

1635
02:18:10,796 --> 02:18:13,264
'...he turned them into our strength.'

1636
02:18:14,366 --> 02:18:15,924
'He didn't hesitate to shoot me.'

1637
02:18:16,001 --> 02:18:17,468
'Shoot me.'

1638
02:18:22,841 --> 02:18:26,800
'Didn't stop after hearing
his son's voice over the phone.'

1639
02:18:26,878 --> 02:18:28,436
'You'll get your man.'

1640
02:18:28,547 --> 02:18:30,981
'Bring them to section post 40.'

1641
02:18:35,821 --> 02:18:38,289
'Because we all had
three more weaknesses.'

1642
02:18:38,690 --> 02:18:41,454
'Honour, Duty and Country.'

1643
02:18:41,893 --> 02:18:43,793
'You know what's going to happen...'

1644
02:18:43,862 --> 02:18:45,454
'...yet you want to do this.'

1645
02:18:45,564 --> 02:18:48,089
'You said I started all this.'

1646
02:18:49,701 --> 02:18:51,669
'So, I am going to finish it.'

1647
02:19:26,071 --> 02:19:27,333
I...

1648
02:19:28,006 --> 02:19:31,942
Come.
- You? - Come on.

1649
02:19:33,979 --> 02:19:35,571
Come on.

1650
02:19:36,415 --> 02:19:37,780
Turn around.

1651
02:19:44,589 --> 02:19:45,886
I will see.

1652
02:19:55,934 --> 02:19:57,162
Clip the wires.

1653
02:20:01,173 --> 02:20:02,902
Come on fast.

1654
02:20:04,543 --> 02:20:05,737
Move.

1655
02:20:13,618 --> 02:20:16,314
Rudra!
- Go. Go. Go.

1656
02:20:16,755 --> 02:20:19,588
Don't wait for me. Go.
- Come on.

1657
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:23,459
Come on, Rudra.

1658
02:20:26,398 --> 02:20:27,524
Go.

1659
02:20:32,337 --> 02:20:34,032
Run. Come on.

1660
02:20:40,512 --> 02:20:41,672
Hold!

1661
02:20:41,747 --> 02:20:43,977
They're in Indian territory now.

1662
02:21:38,036 --> 02:21:41,972
So, Ashwini?
- Welcome back.

1663
02:21:43,608 --> 02:21:45,132
Welcome back!

1664
02:21:45,577 --> 02:21:47,169
Welcome back!

1665
02:21:47,913 --> 02:21:49,938
Is this why you did all this?

1666
02:21:50,682 --> 02:21:55,176
You lost more than
50 men in this effort.

1667
02:21:56,755 --> 02:21:58,552
You can take a picture now.

1668
02:21:58,623 --> 02:22:01,683
Like hunters do, with their dead prey.

1669
02:22:01,793 --> 02:22:05,593
After all, you've brought
India's most wanted back.

1670
02:22:06,097 --> 02:22:08,258
Celebrate all you want.

1671
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:11,168
Because,
a year later you'll know that...

1672
02:22:11,236 --> 02:22:13,466
....whether it's Tihar or Arthur road...

1673
02:22:13,572 --> 02:22:17,167
....I'm still doing what
I was in ccc or Karachi.

1674
02:22:19,678 --> 02:22:24,479
Ashwini. This nation's my mother...

1675
02:22:25,083 --> 02:22:27,916
....and Mumbai's my lover.

1676
02:22:29,487 --> 02:22:31,648
I wanted to come back.

1677
02:22:31,923 --> 02:22:33,322
I discussed it as well.

1678
02:22:33,725 --> 02:22:36,660
But the government
didn't want me back.

1679
02:22:36,862 --> 02:22:40,628
You all know about it.

1680
02:22:41,466 --> 02:22:45,027
I told Wali Khan.
Everyone has a price.

1681
02:22:45,136 --> 02:22:47,900
You just need to know how much.

1682
02:22:48,173 --> 02:22:51,506
And, I learnt this lesson
here in Mumbai, India.

1683
02:22:51,743 --> 02:22:55,042
East or West, India is the best.

1684
02:22:55,113 --> 02:22:56,546
Great.

1685
02:22:57,916 --> 02:23:01,044
It's useless.

1686
02:23:01,486 --> 02:23:04,944
You had the chance to kill me,
but you didn't take it.

1687
02:23:05,023 --> 02:23:07,218
Because, you've the
same problem as our nation.

1688
02:23:07,292 --> 02:23:09,351
You like to give a chance.
Whether its some politician, police...

1689
02:23:09,427 --> 02:23:10,553
....me or...

1690
02:23:10,629 --> 02:23:14,497
Or that swine Kasab who was
killing everyone at VT station.

1691
02:23:14,566 --> 02:23:15,863
What did you do with him?

1692
02:23:15,967 --> 02:23:17,647
Showed him your
hospitality for four years.

1693
02:23:17,669 --> 02:23:19,159
And later, hanged him on the noose.

1694
02:23:19,271 --> 02:23:22,832
Rascals. That wasn't anything great.

1695
02:23:23,375 --> 02:23:25,502
He came to Mumbai to die.

1696
02:23:25,610 --> 02:23:27,578
And, you're rejoicing
now after killing him.

1697
02:23:27,679 --> 02:23:30,477
Welcome back?

1698
02:23:30,916 --> 02:23:33,714
The same thing's
going to happen with me.

1699
02:23:34,219 --> 02:23:35,550
You will arrest me.

1700
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:37,087
Invite panels on channels.

1701
02:23:37,188 --> 02:23:38,655
People will talk about
me in local trains.

1702
02:23:38,723 --> 02:23:41,590
People will sell oil,
mobile, soap in breaking news.

1703
02:23:41,693 --> 02:23:43,354
Barkha, Rajdeep
they'll speak about me.

1704
02:23:43,428 --> 02:23:44,622
Arnab Goswami will scream.

1705
02:23:44,696 --> 02:23:46,220
And, when they all calm down.

1706
02:23:46,298 --> 02:23:49,290
I'll go to Bigg Boss with Salman.

1707
02:23:49,734 --> 02:23:52,225
And I might win too.
After all, I am a don.

1708
02:23:52,304 --> 02:23:54,465
And, do you know what
I'll do with the prize money?

1709
02:23:54,639 --> 02:23:58,200
Build a tomb for
idiots like Wali Khan.

1710
02:23:58,443 --> 02:24:00,240
I might even write few lines on it.

1711
02:24:00,312 --> 02:24:03,611
East or West, India is the best.

1712
02:24:17,095 --> 02:24:18,653
India's the best.

1713
02:24:20,265 --> 02:24:22,859
I've been asking him
to shut up since Karachi.

1714
02:24:25,103 --> 02:24:26,798
But, you can't do it.

1715
02:24:29,441 --> 02:24:30,738
It's true.

1716
02:24:32,877 --> 02:24:34,469
We made mistakes.

1717
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:36,913
We're still making one.

1718
02:24:37,482 --> 02:24:41,475
But, our biggest mistake is you.

1719
02:24:42,354 --> 02:24:43,844
Our men are tired.

1720
02:24:44,823 --> 02:24:46,620
They want a change.

1721
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:50,721
So, we'll begin with you.

1722
02:24:51,796 --> 02:24:53,889
Take off your glasses.

1723
02:24:54,532 --> 02:24:57,865
And watch the face of new India.

1724
02:25:16,654 --> 02:25:18,815
In 15 years, I killed many people.

1725
02:25:21,426 --> 02:25:22,893
First time it felt nice.

1726
02:25:32,103 --> 02:25:37,063
'The story we ended today,
may have many variations.'

1727
02:25:38,176 --> 02:25:42,545
'But I fear,
no one will want to hear it.'

1728
02:26:10,442 --> 02:26:13,343
No more string...

1729
02:26:14,212 --> 02:26:17,340
....of memories.

1730
02:26:18,283 --> 02:26:21,582
Not a strand of...

1731
02:26:22,220 --> 02:26:25,155
....my existence.

1732
02:26:26,691 --> 02:26:30,149
Why did the earth forget them?

1733
02:26:30,762 --> 02:26:34,095
Why did the heaven forget them?

1734
02:26:34,632 --> 02:26:41,003
I wonder where they're lost.

1735
02:26:41,806 --> 02:26:48,871
Those who weaved
dreams with their blood.

1736
02:26:49,681 --> 02:26:53,117
And, their obsession...

1737
02:26:53,451 --> 02:26:57,046
....paved new ways.

1738
02:26:58,223 --> 02:27:01,488
Why did the earth forget them?

1739
02:27:02,193 --> 02:27:05,492
Why did the heaven forget them?

1740
02:27:06,064 --> 02:27:12,367
I wonder where they're lost.

1741
02:27:12,937 --> 02:27:16,805
Even the stars...

1742
02:27:16,875 --> 02:27:20,834
....couldn't give them refuge.

1743
02:27:20,912 --> 02:27:28,842
It's the story,
both worlds overlooked.

1744
02:27:29,087 --> 02:27:35,788
The ones we turned to smoke.

1745
02:27:48,673 --> 02:27:52,666
Those who only give...

1746
02:27:52,744 --> 02:27:55,804
....and never ask.

1747
02:27:56,648 --> 02:28:03,577
We've created this
ambiance by robbing them.

1748
02:28:05,123 --> 02:28:08,320
If the earth forgets them?

1749
02:28:09,027 --> 02:28:12,428
If the heaven forgets them?

1750
02:28:13,031 --> 02:28:18,628
We'll never sing again.

1751
02:28:19,804 --> 02:28:27,768
Even the stars couldn't
give them refuge.

1752
02:28:27,845 --> 02:28:35,650
It's the story,
both worlds overlooked...

1753
02:28:35,954 --> 02:28:41,415
The ones we turned to smoke.

1754
02:28:41,492 --> 02:28:45,451
Even the stars...

1755
02:28:45,530 --> 02:28:49,330
....couldn't give them refuge.

1756
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:57,432
It's the story,
both worlds overlooked.

1757
02:28:57,675 --> 02:29:03,705
The ones we turned to smoke.

1758
02:29:05,016 --> 02:29:09,976
Why did we turn them into smoke?

1759
02:29:10,054 --> 02:29:12,955
Smoke.

1760
02:29:13,057 --> 02:29:16,720
Why did we...
