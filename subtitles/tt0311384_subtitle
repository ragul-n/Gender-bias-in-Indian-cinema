3
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,140
So you think this story can't
be made into a film?

4
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,210
No! I've begun a film company
to make profits.

5
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:21,710
Write a story in which
there's love and lovers.

6
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,820
Yes, box office!

7
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,950
Spare a thought for the country,
for these children.

8
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,500
These children are the future
of the country, indeed, of humanity.

9
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,810
Don't destroy them. At least
listen to my story in its entirety.

10
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,200
Ay, raddiwala!
Tie the stakes well.

11
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,550
It has to be ready soon.

12
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,870
- Aree, Uma...
- Coming.

13
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,580
Don't you dare say anything.

14
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,070
Go away from here!

15
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,070
Worthless fellow!
You spoilt the sari.

16
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,020
I'll beat some sense into you today!
Scoundrel! You'll act, will you?

17
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,670
Go away.
Go do some more theater.

18
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,190
When I grow up,
I'll definitely take part in theater.

19
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,010
Let's see what uncle does then!

20
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,680
- Witch! You tattled about me!
- I didn't tell anyone anything.

21
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,880
What do you mean you didn't tell
on me? I'll beat you into pulp.

22
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,530
I'll beat you to pulp!

23
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,390
Let go of me!
I'll make mincemeat of you!

24
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,800
When I meet you again,
I'll cut your nose off!

25
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,580
- Where are you going?
- What's it to you? To the town.

26
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,290
Are you enrolling this child in school?

27
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,580
Yes.

28
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,540
You did well.
He's a very accomplished boy.

29
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,900
He's a hooligan.

30
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Oh, so this hooligan wants to study?

31
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,910
Look, my friend,
I've beaten that lot into submission.

32
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,250
Let me take your leave now.
I've a lot to do.

33
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,910
Go sit there!

34
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,420
Show me your homework!

35
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,680
You grow mangoes as well
in your orchard? Good, good!

36
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,120
You! Show me your work!

37
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,850
Scoundrel! Your handwriting is so bad.

38
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,750
Go sit there.
You, Roopchand, show me your work.

39
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,980
Hey, is there anything
inside your head today?

40
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,520
Want to know more?

41
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,330
- Beat him.
- Let go!

42
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,060
- Beat him.
- Get lost!

43
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,380
Get up.

44
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,140
Let me see.

45
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,380
Take this.

46
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,270
- Is this the one?
- That's him, sir.

47
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,470
Quiet.

48
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,340
Give them 10 rupees
and send them away.

49
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,850
Leave.

50
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,970
This is Udayan's grandfather.

51
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,910
There are many elderly people
like him in our country.

52
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:02,040
I feel despondent when I think
that strange dreams don't come true

53
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,040
I have to suppress my emotions.

54
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,370
Don't feel despondent, my son.

55
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,050
Great feats are achieved in the world
by people who have such thoughts.

56
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,190
It's futile to suppress your emotions.

57
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,180
Do it harder.

58
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,330
- Let it cook more.
- All right.

59
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,570
Sit straight.

60
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,240
Udayan.

61
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,100
Wash your hands immediately
with the solution in the blue bottle.

62
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,140
Diseases like those are contagious.

63
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,576
Ah, yes!

64
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,970
Now I see a glimpse
of you in these pictures,

65
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,680
But you need
new experiences, my son.

66
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,160
You should go
to a big city and see life.

67
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,130
Where should I go?

68
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,800
You should go to Benaras.

69
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,800
Your imagination will be
stimulated there.

70
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,320
I immediately left for Benaras.

71
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,520
Ramesh is bringing some girls...

72
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,420
but we need to find more boys
and girls and do the show soon.

73
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,380
- Okay, but...
- Don't worry about the money.

74
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,110
I'll make all the arrangements.

75
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,580
Look, they've arrived.

76
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,680
Hello, Udayan.

77
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,820
- Hello, Noor.
- Hello.

78
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,360
Hello. Come in and sit.

79
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,740
I've brought these girls.

80
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,200
Their father is my friend and
a professor at Allahabad University,

81
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,826
There's one thing.

82
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,610
He said they
won't work for money.

83
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,260
One more thing, Udayan,
my uncle has come from Bombay.

84
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,850
I told him about you
and he wants to meet you.

85
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,546
- Can you come tomorrow?
- Sure.

86
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,960
- You come too, Noor.
- Of course.

87
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,750
Who is it?

88
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,540
Who is it?

89
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,760
This is what happens
when you misuse "Taal".

90
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,290
What are you doing? It's not him.

91
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,460
You've brought the wrong person.

92
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,110
Get up.

93
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,560
Now that you're here,
let me show you something.

94
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,860
This is "Taal", on whose beats
the entire world revolves.

95
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,970
They transmit life force
to the universe.

96
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,440
Noor, you've arrived!

97
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,130
- Hello, Udayan.
- Hello.

98
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,210
The same girl. The same face.

99
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,370
You're staring at her,
as though you know each other.

100
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,650
Ramesh! I told my brother
not to make fun of me.

101
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,860
Come.

102
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,500
Uncle, this is my friend Udayan...

103
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,080
and this is Noor Mohammed.

104
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,040
- So you're Udayan. Hello.
- Hello.

105
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,820
Noor, come and sit.

106
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,280
Please sit, Udayan.

107
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,590
It's a pleasure to meet you both.

108
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,920
My daughter, Uma.

109
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,940
- She's naughty.
- Naughty boy's sister.

110
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,940
I agree. You are
this naughty boy's sister...

111
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,330
and so you're my little sister.

112
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,250
I'll address you informally.

113
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,000
You should address me informally,
brother Noor.

114
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,240
You only met each other a minute ago,
and now you've become siblings.

115
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,910
- Why not?
- And he's silent.

116
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,350
Ramesh said that
you're a painter as well as a dancer.

117
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,630
I love both of those arts.

118
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,060
She has been learning dance
since childhood.

119
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,200
Really? That's so strange.

120
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,190
Now he speaks.

121
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,946
Get them some tea.

122
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,270
I'll come too.

123
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,810
Is that the same knife
I gave you as a child?

124
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,190
Yes. It's the same knife.

125
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,740
When are you performing the show?

126
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,700
As soon as possible.

127
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,920
Father, it will be my first chance
to dance on stage.

128
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,310
Unfortunately I won't be able
to attend the show.

129
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,480
- Why not?
- I've to go to Allahabad for work.

130
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,680
Be patient, my heart

131
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,230
Why are you getting restless?

132
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,570
It is an unknown
happiness and desire

133
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,460
Be patient. You will achieve it

134
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,470
Be patient, my heart

135
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,370
Forgive me. Whenever I see
Lord Shiva's processions...

136
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,400
I forget myself, and I start singing.

137
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,870
Why are you so restless?

138
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,880
Has the flower
of your heart blossomed?

139
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,740
All the secrets of your heart...

140
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,800
who has heard them?

141
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,440
Who has heard them?

142
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,690
Who opened the door of his heart...

143
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,530
and gave you a place to stay?

144
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,300
Be patient, my heart

145
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,310
What could I teach you, Uma?
You're fantastic.

146
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,980
I love the dance
you've choreographed.

147
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,550
Do it again.

148
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,470
Brother, the manager
of Shakuntala Theater is here.

149
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,310
I told you about him.

150
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,120
- Is he from Malabar too?
- No.

151
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

152
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,650
So you're rehearsing.
Very good.

153
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,360
Can you all leave, please?

154
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,630
Why did you ask them to leave?
Let them continue.

155
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,270
He's my good friend.

156
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,610
He helped me with my show...

157
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,260
and he's promised to help us
at Shakuntala Theater.

158
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,280
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

159
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,710
Goodbye.

160
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,790
- The entire city knows...
- Let's talk about money.

161
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,360
No, not now.

162
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,880
It depends on the show.

163
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,130
I'll make sure the theater is full.

164
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,490
Then there will be
lots of money.

165
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,100
I agree. Let's set a date.

166
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,310
It's all over.

167
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,140
Uma, are you really going
to Mumbai tonight?

168
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,680
Yes, I have to.

169
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,290
You're leaving.
They're leaving too.

170
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,860
I'll feel forlorn.

171
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,830
I'll pray to God that someday
I can help you in this work.

172
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,530
These past few weeks
passed like a dream

173
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,910
All of you are leaving
at the wrong time.

174
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,556
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

175
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,080
- Write to us.
- I will.

176
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,060
Say hello to your father for me.
Goodbye, Uma.

177
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,890
What's the hurry?
Leave everything as it is.

178
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,290
We will do as we wish.

179
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,360
- Get out of our way.
- We don't have to listen to you.

180
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,570
- Leave now!
- What's going on?

181
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,790
I advertised the show a lot.

182
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,010
If it wasn't a success,
what can I do?

183
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,590
- He says we owe him 300 rupees.
- Why?

184
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,310
Look. I spent this
much money on advertising...

185
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:30,656
distribution, printing posters,
renting curtains, renting chairs...

186
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,810
Carriages and horses.
All initial expenses.

187
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,386
- Who knew you?
- Show me the accounts.

188
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,470
Who are you
to look at my accounts?

189
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,300
You're a liar and a cheat.

190
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,540
Go to hell!

191
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,170
I will crush you.

192
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,530
Thief.

193
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,570
So you want money!

194
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,260
Let's get out of here!

195
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,960
Police! Police! Police!

196
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,900
- Quick!
- Police!

197
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,260
Both of you know
what happened next.

198
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,380
He feels guilty
for murdering the manager.

199
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:41,600
Don't ever leave him alone.

200
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,060
Death is here as well.
Death is all around.

201
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,840
Who's there?

202
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,850
A woman.
I wander in darkness.

203
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,570
Who are you?

204
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,930
Do you think I'm crazy?

205
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,950
I'm not crazy.

206
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,430
My mother has just died.

207
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,926
Death.

208
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,150
Whenever you hear a scream,
someone else has died.

209
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,250
No, I won't let you go.

210
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,040
I found a lone man alive
in this hamlet of death.

211
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,260
Where is Udayan?

212
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,130
Brother Noor! Brother Noor!

213
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,300
Noor.

214
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,350
Noor.

215
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,100
Brother Noor.

216
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,650
You've come.

217
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,070
You're the same man
I met in the dark.

218
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,920
A dead body is lying
in my house, too.

219
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,850
The nectar is falling.
Collect it from the tall palms

220
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,560
The pot at the top is overflowing

221
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:02,490
We fill up big pots at home

222
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,370
The pot at the top is overflowing

223
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,520
The nectar is falling.
Collect it from the tall palms

224
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,620
Kamini, why are you sad?

225
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,640
Come on, the dancing
outside is wonderful.

226
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,520
- You'll feel better.
- I don't like rustic dancing.

227
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,070
I don't like this village.

228
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,250
These villagers
are the life of our country.

229
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,420
Have you decided
about leaving tomorrow?

230
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,120
How can I decide?
You're busy with your friends.

231
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,990
Tell me. Where will you go?

232
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,170
Why not come to Bombay with me?

233
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,330
The estate account.
The Bombay company account.

234
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,220
The bank account.
The key to the safe.

235
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,950
Very good.

236
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,860
Let's talk about work, Udayan.

237
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,360
- If we tour Allahabad, Benaras...
- Not Benaras.

238
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,340
Or Allahabad.
Cross them both out.

239
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,230
Calcutta

240
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,380
Lucknow

241
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,460
Delhi

242
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,560
Karachi

243
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,510
Lahore

244
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,460
Agra

245
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,410
Madras

246
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,660
Bombay

247
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,380
Wake up.

248
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,780
You always sleep
in this wonderful city.

249
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,850
Which city?

250
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:44,320
All the filth of Europe
and America has been dumped here.

251
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:50,630
What's shameful is that
we are proud of our ignorance.

252
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,140
I like Benaras.

253
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,530
You're sleeping again.
Wake up.

254
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,260
Our dress rehearsal is today.

255
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,710
Rehearsal?

256
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,720
Of course, you'll get
to meet Uma today.

257
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,680
This is Uma and her father.
This is Kamini.

258
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,380
Udayan has told me
a lot about you.

259
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,480
This is my friend Sunder,
and another friend.

260
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,660
Start rehearsing. I'm coming.

261
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,100
Once more.

262
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,980
Once more.

263
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,620
Once more.

264
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,816
- I can't do it.
- If they can do it, so can you.

265
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,040
I'm tired.

266
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,060
So now you know everything.

267
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,390
But don't tell anyone.

268
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,220
So you really...

269
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,900
Please, understand me...

270
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,890
my life is a living hell.

271
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,210
Come on, get up.

272
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,020
Watch us dance for five minutes.

273
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,910
Go on rehearsing.

274
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,270
Come on, it's getting late.

275
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,750
We'll be right back.

276
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,240
I toil for you,
but it's all for nothing.

277
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,670
You only think of Uma.
I'll kick her out.

278
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,170
No one can snatch you
away from me.

279
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,490
Listen, Kamini,
you mind your tongue.

280
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,990
Those poor girls and boys
slog for me day and night...

281
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,330
and you dare complain about them!

282
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,710
Who walks on the banks
of Yamuna with a slow gait?

283
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,260
Dressed as a woman from low caste,
she seems like a queen from heaven

284
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,370
She's dressed in a yellow sari.
She has covered herself

285
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,470
She doesn't wear anklets.
Whose wife is she?

286
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,866
Who walks on the banks
of Yamuna with a slow gait?

287
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,370
Dressed as a woman from low caste,
she seems like a queen from heaven

288
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,420
Do come, Uncle.

289
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,300
- Today is our last show.
- I'll come.

290
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:02,710
Uma, I didn't know
you were also a good cook.

291
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,626
- Goodbye, uncle.
- Goodbye.

292
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,830
- Goodbye, Uma.
- Goodbye.

293
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,890
Uma.

294
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,160
- What's happened?
- Autograph please.

295
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,890
Where were you?

296
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Do I always have
to tell you where I go?

297
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,120
- Uma's house.
- Here, a letter from Uma.

298
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,290
Why are you so quiet?

299
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,250
You'll get sick
working so hard, Udayan.

300
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,430
Not sick, I'll go crazy.

301
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,800
There's no need to get angry.
I didn't say it to hurt you.

302
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,640
How could you hurt me?

303
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,380
Police, police.

304
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,370
The police are everywhere.

305
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,040
A death penalty
would've been better than this.

306
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,510
Are you drunk
or have you really gone mad?

307
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,020
I committed a murder!

308
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,560
I'm not joking, Kamini.

309
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,780
- When?
- Before I met you.

310
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,290
- Who was it?
- The manager of Shakuntala Theater.

311
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:55,600
- Shakuntala Theater! Who?
- Shankarlal.

312
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,090
Is it true?
Now I understand...

313
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,710
why you didn't put
your name on the program.

314
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,750
Hello. lnspector.

315
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,760
My life is a living hell...

316
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,530
So for you I am hell.

317
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,260
Let's see how she
extricates you from this hell.

318
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,060
Send the police immediately.

319
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,430
Today is the last show.
Concentrate on your performance.

320
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,190
Now go and rest.

321
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,690
Turn on that spotlight.
Over here.

322
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,050
Towards me. Fine.
Now that one.

323
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,590
- Over here.
- Come with me.

324
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,630
- Where to?
- I want to show you something.

325
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,180
The police are outside
Udayan's room!

326
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,640
What are you doing?

327
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,950
Be quiet.
I'll make everything all right.

328
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,850
Send him in.

329
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:55,240
- Good evening, Ms. Kamini.
- Please, have a seat.

330
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,536
- I hope I'm not late.
- You're right on time.

331
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,940
I value time,
because time is money.

332
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,750
We spoke about money
over the phone.

333
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,200
I've brought it, Ms. Kamini.

334
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,380
Not to praise myself...

335
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:15,030
but believe me,
Shankarlal has never cheated anyone.

336
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,240
I have prospered so much
because of my honesty.

337
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,640
I've called some rich people tonight
to collect money for your art.

338
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:48,970
Miss, should I stop him?

339
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,160
No need.
Thank the inspector for me.

340
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,106
After you get money
at the party tonight...

341
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,290
let these village boys and girls go.

342
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,840
They don't understand you...

343
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,920
or how much you've done for them.

344
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,570
Uma, come here.

345
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,290
Here's the money.
You won't have any problems now.

346
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,420
We all want to leave you.
We discovered you don't need us.

347
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,680
That money belongs to brother Noor.
Donate it to a charity.

348
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,750
Come on!
Why are you taking so long?

349
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:12,030
You go, Kamini.
I don't want to meet them.

350
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:13,750
But for you I...

351
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:21,660
- What is it?
- Nothing.

352
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:25,490
Nothing?

353
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,520
Master!
I've been thinking about him.

354
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,520
- It was a wonderful dance.
- Yes, indeed.

355
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,770
Did you hear, Mr. Naik...

356
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,150
- whiskey is being legalised?
- Really?

357
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:58,200
Yes, it'll now be available
for 30 Rupees.

358
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:05,270
I've paid 125, even 150 Rupees
for it on the black market.

359
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:09,640
I wish men's blood
could be sold like liquor.

360
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,070
It would fetch at least
as high a price.

361
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:18,290
Have you read the news?
There's going to be a severe drought.

362
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,670
A drought.

363
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,260
Our poor country.

364
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,680
I pity us Indians.

365
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,950
I used to faint when I'd read
the news of drought in Bengal.

366
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,690
My husband used to say...

367
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:42,350
"Lily darling,
don't read the newspaper.

368
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,810
You have such a weak heart."

369
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,146
I don't understand why
Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Nehru..

370
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,160
Are taking so long to free our country.

371
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,230
Because you don't pay
their salary, madam.

372
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,930
Hundreds of thousands
are starving in India.

373
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,740
What a pity.

374
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,930
Don't pity them.

375
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,180
Instead, let's drink to their death.

376
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,730
- A toast.
- To their death!

377
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,110
There's nothing else we can do.

378
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,550
Why not?
You are all rich and wealthy.

379
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,270
You could provide financial aid
to the country and the arts.

380
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,896
Good idea.

381
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,620
It's the least we can do.
Isn't it, sir?

382
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:39,160
Not "sir".
He's the King of Mills.

383
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,830
Not a king.

384
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,030
I'm a farmer,
a helper of workers.

385
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,290
A friend to the poor.

386
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,710
This factory is my business.

387
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:05,610
I want to transform the workers
into iron muscles and wheels.

388
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,460
I want to turn them into a machine.

389
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:51,120
Move! Back to work!

390
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,650
Will you lay down your life
for a handful of rice?

391
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,310
No.

392
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,700
It's time.

393
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,140
Have patience.
It's not the right time.

394
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,310
What's happened to him?

395
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,440
All right.

396
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,640
Listen, you don't have
to operate the machine...

397
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:52,560
you have to work like a machine.

398
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,470
We have to work like a machine.
We have to work like a machine.

399
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:18,380
Machine... Machine... Machine...

400
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,000
We are leaving our land
and getting trapped...

401
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,490
in a demon's snare.

402
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,670
Beware!
Don't let him brainwash you.

403
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:21,240
We want money! We want money!

404
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,520
Great! Money!

405
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:43,730
Police!

406
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,610
Money!

407
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:37,740
Money!

408
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,690
My rich and wealthy friends
who have gathered here...

409
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:54,760
I know that all of you love
your country and its culture.

410
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,550
- Of course.
- Yes, certainly.

411
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,980
Mr. Udayan wants to open
a cultural center...

412
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,870
but all of you
will have to help him...

413
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,280
at least for my sake.

414
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:10,240
Sure, I would even
lay down my life for you.

415
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:11,766
Thank you.

416
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,570
Mr. Udayan will now talk to you
about the cultural center.

417
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,340
I should talk to them?

418
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,510
Liquor has dulled their senses.

419
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,810
They only know
how to exploit the poor.

420
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,510
- And I should talk to them?
- Udayan, you're drunk.

421
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,500
You don't know
what you're saying.

422
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,750
I was very drunk.

423
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,280
The trance of your fake culture
made me lose my senses...

424
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,180
but I have regained my senses.

425
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,940
Stop, you're humiliating
these decent people.

426
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,890
Decent?
Which of them is decent?

427
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,960
Show me his face.

428
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:55,790
He, who has stripped
thousands of women bare...

429
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,600
and spun clothes
in his mill for rich women?

430
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:05,490
Or the officer
who loves to rape women?

431
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:06,650
What?

432
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,770
I don't have bad feelings
towards them.

433
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,910
They're living zombies,
who even take bribes from the dead.

434
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,460
These are the women of our society...

435
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,610
who sell their honor
for clothes and jewelry.

436
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:26,646
Are they decent?

437
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,700
- What are you doing?
- Who's decent?

438
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,160
Who can claim to have scruples?

439
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,520
- Nonsense!
- Wild man!

440
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,826
- Why did you invite him?
- What's he doing?

441
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:39,130
- He's crazy!
- Has he no shame?

442
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,910
- We don't know him.
- No money for the cultural center!

443
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,000
I don't care!

444
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:54,730
And you! Because of you
I forgot humanity...

445
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:57,030
and I hurt my friends' feelings.

446
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,840
I became greedy
for fake honor and esteem.

447
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,480
Move.

448
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,860
- Where are you going?
- Where you...

449
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,780
and your corrupt society
can't reach me.

450
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:11,230
Let go!

451
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,150
My poor dear.

452
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,970
- Poor thing.
- Udayan!

453
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:26,890
Udayan.

454
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,450
Mr. Udayan.

455
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,370
You want to promote culture...

456
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,300
but how will you without money?

457
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,460
Even if you went begging
door-to-door...

458
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,930
you wouldn't get more than
5 or 10 rupees.

459
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:02,230
Here, you could've
had thousands all at once.

460
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,500
I respect you a lot.

461
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,440
You can really do
something in the world.

462
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:20,140
I want to donate this money
to your cultural center.

463
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,220
May God grant you success!

464
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,110
I have one request.

465
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:28,290
Don't think that
all rich people are bad.

466
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,300
Rich people are also human.

467
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,250
Sir!

468
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,520
Sir!

469
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:51,830
Here.

470
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,330
5 million rupees!

471
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:09,970
From where did he come?

472
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,320
He's so sweet.

473
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,980
Forgive me.

474
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,980
Udayan opened a cultural centre
in the pristine Himalayas.

475
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:05,190
Many students came
to the cultural center to learn.

476
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,470
Udayan set out on
the biggest mission of his life.

477
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:14,050
Experimental radio station.
Library. Museum.

478
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:19,150
Gymnasium. National theater.

479
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,790
The cultural center
had all kinds of equipment...

480
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:32,960
to develop children's physical
well being before they began school.

481
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:46,840
The students of the cultural center
would have open air lessons...

482
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:50,720
without caring for storm, hail,
or hot or cold weather.

483
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:59,410
Cultural center radio.

484
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:02,800
From now on there will
be a new program every Sunday.

485
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:07,170
Each student
will participate in drama...

486
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:10,210
music or dance,
depending on their talent.

487
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:23,770
We have been unconscious for so long

488
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,740
Silent for so long

489
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:33,120
We are dancing like puppets

490
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,070
We have been unconscious for so long

491
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:42,350
Everybody has donned a mask

492
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,280
Everybody indulges
in pretentious talk

493
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:56,560
Dreams weaved in bygone centuries

494
01:05:56,910 --> 01:06:01,260
For so long we have
been doing other people's bidding

495
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,180
Dancing like puppets

496
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:10,470
We are dancing like puppets

497
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,380
We have been unconscious
for so long

498
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:19,650
We have been divided
into cast and creed

499
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,670
lnto culture and tradition

500
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:28,730
We have been segregated
into religion and family

501
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:38,590
Living in the shadows
of centuries past

502
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:42,540
Dancing like puppets

503
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:47,770
We are dancing like puppets

504
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,430
We have been unconscious for so long

505
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:57,370
We are dancing like puppets

506
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,560
Come in, Kamini.

507
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,860
Kamini, please sit.

508
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,240
I'm delighted you've come.

509
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:26,150
So Udayan lives here too?

510
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:31,026
Actually, that photograph
fell from the table and...

511
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:34,300
- Uma, look who's arrived.
- Brother Ramesh!

512
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,950
All this time we were so happy.

513
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,690
And now the wrath of Rudra.

514
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:43,140
This way, Kamini.

515
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:49,130
Kamini, we lead a strict,
disciplined life.

516
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,940
I understand, Udayan.

517
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:55,710
I left my house and my wealth...

518
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,510
society, everything
for you and your work.

519
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,540
I crave for your love.

520
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,510
I hope you won't reject me.

521
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:09,280
Their brain is not fully utilised.

522
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:14,260
They can't hear.
They can't see. They can't speak.

523
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:18,470
Hail Peace

524
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:46,280
A bomb has exploded!
Run, save your lives!

525
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,420
Drama class.

526
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:07,840
Education today is destroying
the strength of youth.

527
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,269
Only the mind is stimulated.

528
01:09:10,529 --> 01:09:12,249
They're not taught about humanity

529
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,540
I'll find you
a rich girl to marry.

530
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:53,689
My daughter will
work in the civil service.

531
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,460
Your mother was illiterate,
but you've obtained a Masters.

532
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,650
I'll find a civil service job
for my daughter.

533
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:00,486
I've spent thousands
of rupees on you, son.

534
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,106
I'll get much more in return.

535
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:03,880
Did you hear,
this boy has graduated?

536
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:06,090
Well done, a Masters
in Business Administration!

537
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,710
Now I'll demand 50,000 rupees
when you marry!

538
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:16,240
We respect you...

539
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:18,610
but this is our future.

540
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:21,550
Our nation can't progress
without education.

541
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:24,600
Throw away those degrees.
We're crushed by their burden.

542
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,436
To hell with the prestige
of our motherland.

543
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:27,960
I don't want this degree.

544
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,770
- What about after we're educated?
- I don't want this education.

545
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:36,030
I don't want this sort of education.

546
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,880
So many of our nation's youth
are deprived of good education.

547
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,230
For the development of our country...

548
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:22,990
we need not one,
but several cultural centers.

549
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,820
- Undoubtedly.
- You are right.

550
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,950
I remember a tune.

551
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,680
Glory to India

552
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:04,800
Glory to India

553
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,870
Glory to awakened India

554
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,710
This song is a pledge for our future.

555
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:20,270
We will revere our golden past
by singing this song every day.

556
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,780
The world considered
India as the holy place...

557
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,470
of intellect, literature,
culture and tradition.

558
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,570
Today, India is broken into pieces.

559
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:40,390
I am the mother
of 400 million children.

560
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:49,470
My children are sleeping soundly
and dreaming of revolution...

561
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:52,900
while I am being robbed.

562
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:55,840
Mother India is being robbed.

563
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:59,910
Bengali man, stay away from me.

564
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:03,710
I'm from the country of not one
or two, but countless great men.

565
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,930
Ram, Krishna, Arjun, Bheem...

566
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,980
Baba Akbar, Motilal, Jawaharlal,
all born in my country.

567
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:12,020
The Taj Mahal is our creation.
Did you know that?

568
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,770
Don't you push me.
Do you know who I am?

569
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,360
I'm a Bengali.

570
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,140
Our Bengal has great people
like Chandi Thakur...

571
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,700
Bankim Chandra, Rabindranath,
Jagdish Chandra, Subash Chandra.

572
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:29,750
All of you are fools!

573
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,690
Because of you,
foreigners have seized our country.

574
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,710
What are you saying, Bengali?

575
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:37,036
We have great men like
Chhatrapati Veer Shivaji Maharaj...

576
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,466
the Queen of Jhansi Laxmi,
Dnyaneshwar Tukaram...

577
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:42,350
Ranade, Bal Gangadhar Tilak.

578
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,550
So what? You're nothing
compared to the Punjabis.

579
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:52,300
Look, the crops
have started budding

580
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:58,230
Get me married, Mother.
My beloved has brought me slippers

581
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:06,360
He went out to shop.
What did he get?

582
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:09,620
He bought an axe

583
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,550
Make her wear the wedding bangles

584
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,930
Apply kohl to her eyes

585
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,510
She walks away with a smile

586
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:27,460
She is loved by everyone

587
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:33,480
Hear me out. I hold an important
office in this village

588
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:39,610
Be careful, my friend.
Take that

589
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:43,280
Come on, everyone

590
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:46,830
Be careful, my friend.
Take that

591
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,170
Someone dodgy holds the office

592
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:55,660
Be careful, my friend.
Take that

593
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,550
We have one of the oldest
universities in the country.

594
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,120
We feed the nation.
We are proud of this.

595
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:12,570
We have great people like Guru Nanak,
Lala Lajpat Rai and Bhagat Singh.

596
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:15,740
- What did you say about us?
- Don't let them hear.

597
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,410
Don't ruin their lives.

598
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,110
Don't make them enemies of humanity.

599
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:26,290
Mother lndia's little children...

600
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:31,080
are crying on their
hapless and fallen mother's lap.

601
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:33,970
We have to show them
the new light of life...

602
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:37,440
which leads them to the golden path
of love for all and equality.

603
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:39,590
Vande Mataram.

604
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,580
Our ancestors crowned Mother India.

605
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:44,870
Great sages and saints
were born in our country.

606
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,030
Ram, Krishna and Buddha
were our ancestors.

607
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:50,450
Poets like Kalidas, Khushru,
Tulsidas, Surdas, Kabir...

608
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:54,430
Zou, Ghalib and Rabindranath
were born in our country.

609
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:58,240
The great Gandhi
lives in our country.

610
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:03,320
They only make speeches.
They don't do anything themselves.

611
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:06,280
- Gandhi.
- Glory to him!

612
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,190
- Mother India.
- Glory to her!

613
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:12,070
Stop singing glories.

614
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,550
Don't insult your mother,
who is plagued by conventions...

615
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:22,730
infighting and orthodox views,
with these glories.

616
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:30,050
I always thought your glories
would improve things for me...

617
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:34,060
but instead they're
always merely words.

618
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:45,010
Mother India is afraid to enter your
dark world of illiteracy and devastation.

619
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:51,740
Before liberating your community,
country and humanity...

620
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:55,870
you have to liberate yourself
from the shackles of stupidity.

621
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:02,080
You are in a deep slumber,
dreaming of revolution.

622
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,540
In your dreams
you are using your strength...

623
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:08,680
to cut each other's throats.

624
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:15,180
Caste discrimination
is poisoning our society.

625
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,570
The power of love
and unity can save humanity.

626
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:23,510
Set an example and let this power
prevail and triumph.

627
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:25,190
There is hope.

628
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,050
Wake up!
The world is rousing you.

629
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,040
Unite,
because you truly are united.

630
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:38,530
Come, brave soldiers of the country

631
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:42,880
The ones who have grown up
on the waters of Ganga and Jamuna

632
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:47,030
The cultured people
of this country of Bengalis

633
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:51,390
The religious ones
of the Southern region

634
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:55,650
Come, unite
and forget your differences

635
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:59,900
Make India heaven

636
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,980
Hindustan

637
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:12,300
The earth and the sky of one world

638
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:16,710
All of us will surely unite

639
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:21,380
Bathe in blood

640
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:25,470
Endure your tears

641
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:33,150
Safeguard customs and traditions

642
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:36,910
We will make a new world

643
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:40,760
We will create a new human

644
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,670
We will liberate women

645
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:48,630
Our dear mother of humanity

646
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,490
We will liberate humanity

647
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:56,250
We will liberate people

648
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:58,320
Hindustan

649
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:04,200
The earth and the sky of one world

650
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:08,100
All of us will unite fearlessly

651
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:12,020
May our respect be intact

652
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:13,980
Glory to India

653
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:20,270
Glory to awakened India

654
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:31,140
You wanted to discuss
the expenses, didn't you?

655
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,980
We've spent 5 million rupees wisely...

656
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,540
yet still our expenses are mounting.

657
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:39,730
Where can we find money?

658
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:45,440
If we tour the country performing,
won't we earn money?

659
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,760
I have a friend in Mumbai
who owns a film studio.

660
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:52,106
I can write to him if you want.

661
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:55,030
If we made a film,
we could earn a lot of money.

662
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,460
A film?

663
01:22:56,990 --> 01:23:01,000
It's a good idea, Kamini.
But in our country...

664
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,120
films are doing more harm than good.

665
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:07,150
I wouldn't like to work
with the film industry.

666
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,146
Anything but making a film!

667
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:14,370
I didn't think my idea
would be rebuffed like that.

668
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:18,420
- If you don't make a film, then beg.
- Why would we beg?

669
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:22,280
If we're truly dedicated to our art,
people will come and donate money.

670
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:24,010
They'll never come.

671
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:26,400
People won't spend
money and time coming here.

672
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,030
Why shouldn't they come?

673
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,860
We'll organise a cultural festival.

674
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,966
Spring is drawing near.
We'll celebrate it, along with...

675
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:40,876
The inauguration
of our national theater.

676
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,000
Exactly!

677
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,200
- Brilliant!
- Perfect!

678
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:45,926
What a great idea!

679
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:47,630
It's a wonderful idea.

680
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:55,160
Why didn't you come
to dinner, Kamini?

681
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,680
What do you care?
Who are you to ask me?

682
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:01,780
I don't think you're well today.

683
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:03,870
Go away.
I don't feel well.

684
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:11,570
I have some good news.

685
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:13,900
We've decided to have
a spring festival.

686
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:17,510
We'll perform all
different Indian dances.

687
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:20,020
- It'll be great fun.
- Really?

688
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,460
Close the window. I feel cold.

689
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:40,360
- Will you close it or not?
- Air is good for you.

690
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:45,220
I'm sleeping beside the window
but I don't feel cold.

691
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,760
How come you feel cold?

692
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:49,720
If you want to quarrel,
just be honest.

693
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,000
- Don't use the window as an excuse.
- Don't argue with me!

694
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:59,770
- Let me go!
- What are you doing?

695
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:25,900
- This can't be tolerated!
- You're right.

696
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:30,020
Before criticising Kamini,
we must first look at ourselves.

697
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:33,730
We're taught about
reforming bad habits...

698
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:37,126
but we quickly forget
these teachings...

699
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:38,960
and start criticising each other.

700
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,610
Who here is without vice?

701
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:45,020
Is it better to complain about vices
or to reform them?

702
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:52,470
Come on, let's elope.

703
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:57,020
Life is so stringent here,
we can't live in peace.

704
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,510
I hate this place.

705
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:08,910
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

706
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:12,930
You won't, will you?

707
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,250
What about your love for Udayan...

708
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,710
for which I endured
everything until now...

709
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,950
even your slaps?

710
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:26,700
Please, Uma,
promise you won't tell Udayan.

711
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:28,500
Will I tell Udayan?

712
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:31,790
Okay, I won't tell him.
Now go.

713
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:38,320
I can't believe it!

714
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,870
- Send Uma, and Madan too.
- (Muffled)

715
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:03,340
Uma, is Kamini speaking the truth?

716
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:08,600
Well?
Why don't you answer me?

717
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,610
What's this all about?

718
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,286
When did you start seeing Madan?

719
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:15,610
Madan and me?

720
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:19,360
- Let it be, Udayan.
- Uma!

721
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,180
Uma!

722
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:28,280
Madan, is Kamini speaking the truth?

723
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,570
I was going to tell you personally.

724
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,100
Don't you feel ashamed?

725
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,590
- It's Kamini's fault too.
- And Uma?

726
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:38,230
Uma saw Kamini and me together.

727
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:41,520
- You're having an affair with Uma!
- With Uma? No!

728
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,460
- Forgive me, Uma.
- Don't say that.

729
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:56,370
To stop these trivial matters from
harming the principles of this place...

730
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:59,450
it's better if I leave
after the spring festival.

731
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,730
Uma. Uma!

732
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:03,950
Forgive me.

733
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:08,296
I didn't know my little joke
would become so serious.

734
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,820
You call this a joke?

735
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:15,650
Uma, we'll talk about this later.

736
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:25,700
Finally, you'll have a chance
to win Udayan's heart.

737
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,980
Kamini!

738
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:40,650
Kamini. Kamini!

739
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,000
Forgive me.

740
01:28:55,450 --> 01:29:01,240
It keeps flowing

741
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:16,040
It's been flowing for so long

742
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:27,130
The tumultuous current of life

743
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:31,110
It keeps saying

744
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:48,910
It keeps saying

745
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:56,840
My capricious heart is swaying

746
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:04,450
Waves rise and fall every moment

747
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:12,480
The sad plight of my heart

748
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:16,240
It keeps saying

749
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:25,960
Rise

750
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:29,350
It keeps flowing

751
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:43,870
The banks that never meet
depict the motion of life

752
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:51,700
It flows and faces
the obstacles in its way

753
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:54,400
It keeps enduring

754
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:13,430
Rise

755
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:16,810
It keeps flowing

756
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:35,610
Don't be sad, Uma.

757
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,780
You know? You've become
an integral part of my life.

758
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:52,660
When I think of work,
I first think of you.

759
01:31:54,130 --> 01:31:55,630
Now I understand.

760
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:58,670
Come, let's go to the temple.

761
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,500
- Have you seen Udayan anywhere?
- No.

762
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:10,100
I feel as though
I've always known you.

763
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:13,770
What's so surprising about that?
Maybe you have.

764
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:15,560
Remember this?

765
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:22,320
When I was young, a girl...

766
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:34,160
So, you're the black witch
that stoned me!

767
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:36,380
See!
That's why I never told you.

768
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,760
I knew you'd want revenge.

769
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:41,316
Naughty girl.
Why didn't you tell me before?

770
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,640
- I was afraid to.
- Come on, let's tell everyone.

771
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:17,880
Wake up

772
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:26,780
I adore your dusky complexion

773
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:35,780
My handsome Lord

774
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:46,490
I get up early in the morning
and look at you

775
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:55,130
All the milkmaids make fun of me

776
01:35:58,370 --> 01:36:06,080
I keep an eye on your door
just to get a glimpse of you

777
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:10,426
Wake up, Nand Kishore

778
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:11,750
Lord, bless Udayan.

779
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:13,960
May he be successful.

780
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:29,030
Come in.

781
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,260
Uma, what is this?

782
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:37,320
Today is an auspicious day.

783
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,990
Uma, whenever I see you,
I remember my childhood.

784
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,570
Do you even remember when
you were beaten for your mischief?

785
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,840
So you remember that too?

786
01:36:57,010 --> 01:36:58,890
Of course, such sweet memories.

787
01:36:59,370 --> 01:37:03,050
Who knew that vagabond boy
would become the pride of our country?

788
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:08,440
Uma, you love this work immensely.

789
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,000
Will you really leave it all?

790
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,570
I'm sorry, you can't enter.

791
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,920
- I've got a ticket.
- You're not wearing Indian attire.

792
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:36,760
- Is this a joke?
- It's you who are joking!

793
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:40,510
We're celebrating our nation,
and you've worn modern clothes.

794
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:44,260
Ticket. Please follow the yellow
line to the National Theater.

795
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:55,100
Why did they get in?
They're wearing their national dress.

796
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:56,750
Don't be angry.

797
01:37:56,810 --> 01:37:59,880
You should match
your attire to your face.

798
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:08,000
This is a foreign shirt.
It's made in Europe, not India.

799
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:10,580
Put on some Indian clothes.
This way.

800
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:25,610
This is the cultural center.

801
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:28,606
Brothers, today people
from all over the world...

802
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:30,890
have gathered to celebrate
the spring festival.

803
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,030
For the first time ever in India...

804
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:35,206
Never seen before...

805
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:37,066
Nothing like this
has ever happened...

806
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:39,316
in the whole of India.

807
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:40,976
A wonderful cultural program...

808
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,906
Awards for bravery...

809
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:45,110
We should all be proud
to have a cultural center.

810
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:52,050
Uma!

811
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:54,820
You are so exuberant.
You're playing the part of Radha!

812
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:57,720
Who'll be Parvati?

813
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,470
Madan, what's this?

814
01:39:03,790 --> 01:39:05,120
Emotional graph.

815
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:08,340
- Emotional graph?
- Yes, an emotional graph.

816
01:39:08,590 --> 01:39:11,970
Our Kings' emotions
will be displayed here.

817
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:15,100
Quiet. Don't laugh.

818
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,320
PLEASE REMOVE YOUR SHOES

819
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:22,690
- ls anybody there? Where's the door?
- There.

820
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:25,650
Is this a door or a mousehole?

821
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:27,470
You enter from here.

822
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:30,630
Kings as well as paupers
must bow their heads.

823
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:34,390
- This is an insult. Go inside.
- Go inside.

824
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:38,680
- After you.
- After you.

825
01:39:40,450 --> 01:39:41,750
A program pamphlet?

826
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,580
Come on.

827
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:24,840
Today, our country
is on the brink of freedom.

828
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:27,276
In these circumstances
our nation's leaders...

829
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:30,060
will understand the
importance of a national theater.

830
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:33,070
They will join hands with artists...

831
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:36,980
and establish national theaters
throughout the country...

832
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,560
which will safeguard
our country's culture and tradition.

833
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:46,340
This national theater is being
inaugurated by Lord Shiva.

834
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:49,630
A warm welcome to you all
on behalf of the cultural center.

835
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:33,880
Salutations, O Lord Shiva!

836
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:40,610
O consort of Gauri!

837
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:46,370
Folding our hands in devotion...

838
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:52,090
we pray to you, O Lord

839
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:57,540
Take away our fears...

840
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:04,420
and bless us

841
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:09,220
O Lord Shiva, consort of Gauri!

842
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,140
You're trying to be Parvati.

843
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:39,730
Hurry up, Udayan,
everybody's waiting for you.

844
01:45:40,450 --> 01:45:45,180
Ramesh, tell Manipuri's teacher
to begin without me.

845
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:53,480
Sit here.

846
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:57,310
Uma, please leave.

847
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:00,060
I want to talk to Kamini.

848
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,820
Come quickly! Lalita has fainted.

849
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:09,560
Go away, you poor unfortunate!

850
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:15,940
It's not poverty that's unfortunate,
but the fake splendor of the rich.

851
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:20,530
It compels them to beg
and eat their leftovers.

852
01:46:21,010 --> 01:46:23,356
Your jealousy is what's unfortunate.

853
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,670
You can't stand
Udayan's love for this child.

854
01:46:25,950 --> 01:46:27,250
- Uma!
- Keep quiet.

855
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,740
You think you truly love Udayan...

856
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,660
and that I've snatched
his love from you...

857
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,430
but you don't have to snatch
what belongs to you, Kamini.

858
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:43,860
I've known Udayan since childhood,
and I love him.

859
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:48,330
I will love him all my life.
Nobody can stop me.

860
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:52,600
Your love is fatal.

861
01:46:53,770 --> 01:46:55,640
It's fake, deceiving.

862
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:02,080
You wanted to kill me?

863
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:09,040
You didn't think I could stab you
with your own dagger?

864
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:19,250
Evil coward...

865
01:47:19,810 --> 01:47:22,780
I wouldn't soil my hands
with your blood.

866
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:24,340
Go away.

867
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,996
There's no place
for wicked women like you...

868
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:28,690
in Udayan's holy cultural center.

869
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:30,216
- Go!
- Uma!

870
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:31,340
No!

871
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:37,030
I am not mean and cruel like you.

872
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:40,650
I don't want to usurp you
and rule this place.

873
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:44,730
My love knows sacrifice.

874
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:49,500
Udayan's love is shielding me
from the adversities of the world.

875
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:55,600
I have been nurturing this love dearly.

876
01:47:56,190 --> 01:48:00,220
It grew gradually
and encompassed my entire life.

877
01:48:00,790 --> 01:48:04,790
Even so, Udayan
will never know of my love.

878
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:07,610
After finishing my work here...

879
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:10,950
I'll leave this place
cherishing my love in my heart.

880
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:14,200
I'll go far away
where the world is less filthy.

881
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:17,750
Manipuri is about to begin.
Get ready quickly.

882
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,410
Manipuri is about to begin.
Get ready quickly.

883
01:48:57,450 --> 01:49:05,450
Hail the eternal Lord

884
01:49:06,670 --> 01:49:13,210
I am singing in front of you, my Lord

885
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:19,350
In the middle of my heart...

886
01:49:19,410 --> 01:49:24,850
You reside

887
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:33,220
Come to me, Lord

888
01:50:09,650 --> 01:50:15,880
Please, go, oh Brajanath...

889
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:23,840
if it gives you pleasure

890
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:29,160
Had I not been a woman...

891
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:37,600
I would have gone with you forever

892
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:47,320
Saying this cries Binodini

893
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:55,680
Please, go, oh Brajanath

894
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:21,790
Come, oh Lord Hari

895
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:28,940
This place is going to celebrate your song

896
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:31,960
Come, oh Lord Hari

897
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:38,240
This place is going to celebrate your song

898
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:43,336
Awaken and arise in our hearts

899
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,900
Oh come, Lord Hari

900
01:52:06,990 --> 01:52:14,990
Let us dance and sing
with our friends together

901
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:22,590
This auspicious full moon night...

902
01:52:22,650 --> 01:52:28,356
I shall spend
with my beloved and enjoy

903
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:32,830
Let us dance and sing...

904
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:37,720
with our friends together

905
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:12,730
My Girdhar, my beloved...

906
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:15,260
you play the flute

907
01:53:15,770 --> 01:53:18,870
Kanha plays the flute

908
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:12,910
Fill the water-guns
with colors aplenty

909
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:19,040
Men and women are playing
Holi joyously, exuberantly

910
01:54:25,550 --> 01:54:31,750
The whole earth is full
of flowers and is fragrant

911
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:34,870
The whole earth is colorful

912
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:37,896
The garden is beautiful

913
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:44,450
Fill the water-guns
with colors aplenty

914
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:50,860
LEAD US FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT

915
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:54,440
Our eternal lamp
should always burn brightly.

916
01:55:54,970 --> 01:55:57,660
This is our life, our future.

917
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:35,400
Light the lamp. Come

918
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:50,750
Dreams light up life

919
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:58,000
It's the sky of lamps

920
01:56:59,390 --> 01:57:04,250
Light the lamp

921
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:12,840
Dusk brings darkness with it

922
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:23,440
It precedes tomorrow's dawn

923
01:57:25,070 --> 01:57:32,020
Gather the lamps of hope

924
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:39,790
Bring a new era to the world

925
01:57:40,030 --> 01:57:44,810
Light the lamp

926
01:57:45,410 --> 01:57:53,410
Cover it with your veil

927
01:57:54,580 --> 01:58:02,580
Save it from the storm

928
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:10,800
A hundred lamps with similar flames

929
01:58:11,010 --> 01:58:18,680
Use the lamps to light the way

930
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:23,720
Light the lamp

931
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:32,050
We are the future of India

932
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:41,940
We are the people

933
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:49,650
We are the future of India

934
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:54,196
We are the people

935
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:58,710
We are the fruits of labor

936
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:03,160
We are the tomorrow of all tomorrows

937
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:07,630
We are the future of India

938
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:15,380
Observe closely
the faces of these farmers.

939
01:59:15,870 --> 01:59:19,550
Maybe they are asking
who can truly venerate the plough?

940
01:59:20,290 --> 01:59:21,930
You? No.

941
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:25,560
Us farmers, the plough gave us life.

942
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:29,590
For centuries it has fed
a great many millions.

943
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:33,590
We worship the plough,
but we must also see the present.

944
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:36,640
Famine is plaguing our country.

945
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:39,670
We depend on other countries for grain.

946
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:43,050
We have to march with time.

947
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:46,360
There's no shortage
of fertile land in our country.

948
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:48,670
There's only
a shortage of equipment.

949
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:51,440
We have to meet
the demands of the world.

950
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:02,700
Hail the supreme Lord

951
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:05,900
The Lord is the keeper of the poor

952
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:09,330
He is the friend of the poor people

953
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:15,480
You purify all the sinners.
You are the supreme Lord

954
02:01:15,870 --> 02:01:21,900
You show pity to one and all.
You are the friend of the poor

955
02:01:22,270 --> 02:01:26,100
The Lord is the keeper of the poor

956
02:01:57,170 --> 02:01:59,940
Discard fear

957
02:02:25,170 --> 02:02:28,770
lnstead of rising,
our Kings' excitement is dropping.

958
02:02:33,010 --> 02:02:35,200
Look who's coming!

959
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:39,206
Don't shoot, my enemy

960
02:03:39,230 --> 02:03:42,560
My mother-in-law doesn't take it well

961
02:03:42,630 --> 02:03:46,320
Don't shoot, my enemy

962
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:50,080
Stop the boys' dance
and start the girls' dance.

963
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:55,820
The milkmaids like Kanha's armlet

964
02:04:55,960 --> 02:05:01,320
The anklets are taunting me,
even when I walk two steps

965
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:12,080
The milkmaids like Kanha's armlet

966
02:05:39,010 --> 02:05:41,260
Look at what's happening there.

967
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:45,400
Bliss. Bliss. Bliss

968
02:06:01,650 --> 02:06:04,430
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to say something...

969
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:07,210
especially to those women
who live behind the veil...

970
02:06:07,490 --> 02:06:09,490
and have long been
oppressed by men.

971
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:12,110
As long as women are enslaved by men...

972
02:06:12,430 --> 02:06:14,310
humanity will also remained enslaved.

973
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:17,040
Our experiences at
the cultural center have taught us...

974
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:18,826
that our fellow countrywomen...

975
02:06:18,850 --> 02:06:20,960
are no less talented
or intelligent than men.

976
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:24,330
Until our countrywomen are free...

977
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:26,850
we can't be truly free.

978
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:29,910
Will the next generation
of women be so shameless?

979
02:06:30,140 --> 02:06:33,410
You weren't shameless,
but that didn't get us far.

980
02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:52,180
Marvellous! I'm in ecstasy.

981
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:58,590
I feel like splurging
all my wealth on these beauties.

982
02:06:58,990 --> 02:07:00,290
- Secretary?
- Yes, sir.

983
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:02,800
How many girls are dancing?

984
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:06,030
I think around 30 girls, sir.

985
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:08,640
Donate 3 million rupees
to the cultural center...

986
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:12,090
and tell them to get
these 30 girls to dance.

987
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:13,450
Yes, sir.

988
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:16,640
3 million rupees for 30 girls!

989
02:07:17,050 --> 02:07:22,080
My ancestors used to spend
that much on a single girl.

990
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:23,870
Manager.

991
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:27,320
Donate 3 times as much as he did.

992
02:07:58,350 --> 02:08:00,220
- This is quite dangerous!
- Indeed.

993
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:09,230
Gentlemen, please sit down.

994
02:08:22,970 --> 02:08:25,460
Rajendra Singh is amazed.

995
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:57,636
- 5 hundred thousand!
- 1 million rupees.

996
02:08:57,660 --> 02:08:59,356
- 2 million.
- A million and a half.

997
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:00,960
Two and a half million.

998
02:09:01,010 --> 02:09:02,506
- 3 million rupees.
- 6 million!

999
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:04,026
- 4 million.
- 7 million rupees!

1000
02:09:04,050 --> 02:09:06,030
- 10 million rupees!
- 12 million rupees.

1001
02:09:06,430 --> 02:09:07,730
16 million rupees!

1002
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:24,390
to the museum.

1003
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:27,080
Mr. Udayan, why didn't you announce
His Highness's name?

1004
02:09:28,350 --> 02:09:29,750
I'll announce it again.

1005
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,650
His Highness...

1006
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:39,300
1 million rupees to the museum.

1007
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:41,706
Udayan, why didn't you announce
His Highness's name?

1008
02:09:41,730 --> 02:09:43,440
- Again?
- We didn't hear it.

1009
02:09:55,370 --> 02:09:58,700
His Highness Rajendra Singh
has donated...

1010
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:03,550
1 million rupees to the
cultural center's museum.

1011
02:10:05,190 --> 02:10:07,020
I am a Communist.

1012
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:12,000
I don't want people to hear
the names of filthy rich kings.

1013
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:14,120
I won't tolerate it.

1014
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:18,540
You can do my job.
I shall dance.

1015
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:03,090
Who are you?

1016
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:05,120
A man.

1017
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:12,500
Who are you?

1018
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:14,130
Nature.

1019
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:25,340
Culture.

1020
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:03,780
Envy.

1021
02:12:30,510 --> 02:12:31,610
Youth.

1022
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:07,140
Mourning.

1023
02:13:43,610 --> 02:13:44,810
Old age.

1024
02:14:19,090 --> 02:14:20,190
Duty.

1025
02:14:50,850 --> 02:14:51,950
Universe.

1026
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:02,340
Corruption.

1027
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,100
Boycott.

1028
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:35,610
My daughter...

1029
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:40,540
I don't care for society,
but we must be reserved.

1030
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:42,800
Do whatever you want.

1031
02:15:43,370 --> 02:15:45,930
Society. Society!

1032
02:15:47,160 --> 02:15:50,320
It believes in age-old
shackles of righteousness...

1033
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:53,000
and yet breaks them.

1034
02:15:55,020 --> 02:16:00,370
The pride of society is that
it doesn't believe in what it does...

1035
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:03,850
and it doesn't do what it believes in.

1036
02:16:07,540 --> 02:16:10,480
Society is the ultimate authority.

1037
02:16:10,990 --> 02:16:15,000
It breaks God's laws
and creates its own.

1038
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:20,300
If you love her,
prove it in front of them.

1039
02:16:20,670 --> 02:16:24,580
Carry her up to the top of the steps.

1040
02:16:24,890 --> 02:16:28,660
If you fail,
your name will be blackened.

1041
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:30,810
You may die trying.

1042
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:33,865
If you succeed, you will marry her.

1043
02:16:33,889 --> 02:16:35,599
Marry her.

1044
02:16:35,959 --> 02:16:37,299
Come on, begin.

1045
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:40,440
Go on, go on!

1046
02:17:00,629 --> 02:17:01,729
Stop!

1047
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:18,220
Get back!

1048
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:19,930
Get back!

1049
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:21,930
Go on! Go on!

1050
02:17:56,170 --> 02:17:58,760
So, you've finally killed Udayan.

1051
02:17:59,559 --> 02:18:02,869
You met him in your dreams.
I met him in the storm.

1052
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:05,870
Until now,
only my world was ruined.

1053
02:18:06,350 --> 02:18:08,980
Now your world is ruined too.

1054
02:18:19,650 --> 02:18:20,750
Kamini!

1055
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:26,740
What are you looking at?

1056
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:31,090
It's the same Udayan,
but now he's lifeless.

1057
02:18:33,610 --> 02:18:35,790
Come, we can go
wherever we want.

1058
02:19:35,090 --> 02:19:36,190
Uma!

1059
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:39,010
No! No!

1060
02:19:40,110 --> 02:19:42,220
Without you, my life is useless.

1061
02:19:43,430 --> 02:19:45,780
All my dreams will remain unfulfilled.

1062
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:53,490
You! People revere you as God.

1063
02:19:54,310 --> 02:19:57,810
They pray to you day
and night for protection.

1064
02:19:58,350 --> 02:20:00,520
You are the God of destruction.

1065
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:06,150
Are you not content after
wreaking havoc all over the world?

1066
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:03,450
Don't worry.
You can return to the festival.

1067
02:21:11,010 --> 02:21:12,210
You fool.

1068
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:14,760
You're sensible, yet you worry
about a trivial matter.

1069
02:21:15,530 --> 02:21:18,090
Be strong.
Everything will be fine.

1070
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:34,690
Uma, you take care of him.

1071
02:21:34,980 --> 02:21:36,910
We want to see
how the show's going.

1072
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:43,390
Don't worry, Udayan isn't hurt!

1073
02:21:43,490 --> 02:21:44,890
Soon he'll be dancing!

1074
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:53,320
Uma, why are you crying?

1075
02:21:56,420 --> 02:21:57,980
Don't get up. Lie down.

1076
02:22:02,370 --> 02:22:05,130
Uma, will you be mine?

1077
02:22:06,990 --> 02:22:08,190
Tell me.

1078
02:22:13,430 --> 02:22:18,350
Uma, tell me, will you marry me?

1079
02:22:21,610 --> 02:22:23,110
Why don't you answer me?

1080
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:28,380
Udayan, can you come?

1081
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:30,826
Everything has come
to a standstill because of you.

1082
02:22:30,850 --> 02:22:32,250
You come too, Uma.

1083
02:22:41,220 --> 02:22:43,470
Hurrah! Hurrah!

1084
02:23:28,990 --> 02:23:31,456
His Highness asks
if this is an African dance?

1085
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:33,380
Yes, it is ours.

1086
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:43,550
His Highness asks
if this is an African dance?

1087
02:23:44,020 --> 02:23:45,720
I'll make an announcement.

1088
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:53,590
This beautiful dance
comes from the people...

1089
02:23:53,830 --> 02:23:56,770
of the Naga hills
on the border of Assam and Burma.

1090
02:23:57,320 --> 02:24:00,900
Hollywood often portrays
India as Africa.

1091
02:24:01,230 --> 02:24:04,400
Those who thought that
this was an African dance...

1092
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:06,860
have just given ample
proof of their ignorance.

1093
02:24:07,350 --> 02:24:10,066
It is every parent's duty
to let their children...

1094
02:24:10,090 --> 02:24:12,940
travel the world
and widen their knowledge.

1095
02:24:13,890 --> 02:24:18,230
The greatest onus lies on schools,
colleges and universities.

1096
02:25:08,780 --> 02:25:12,410
2,005 rupees.
5 and a half rupees.

1097
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:15,210
- Only 5 rupees.
- Only 5 rupees?

1098
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:18,850
- Hey, only 8 rupees.
- 8 rupees?

1099
02:25:19,290 --> 02:25:23,000
Uma, go and see.
There's a shower of wealth.

1100
02:25:26,490 --> 02:25:28,640
- 5 rupees. 7.
- 5.

1101
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:35,180
7.7 and a half.
6 and a half. 5.4.

1102
02:25:35,290 --> 02:25:38,780
- 5.
- 8.

1103
02:25:45,630 --> 02:25:48,110
- Uma's words have come true.
- Yes.

1104
02:26:34,330 --> 02:26:37,790
Friend, I asked you.
Friend, I asked you

1105
02:26:38,050 --> 02:26:41,470
Friend, the drums are playing,
I asked you

1106
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:45,050
Friend, the cymbals are playing,
I asked you

1107
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:48,660
Friend, wake up the earth,
I asked you

1108
02:26:48,820 --> 02:26:52,270
Friend, I asked you.
Friend, I asked you

1109
02:27:19,620 --> 02:27:21,750
No, it's not possible.

1110
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:52,380
I can't bear it.

1111
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:33,390
Will you be mine, Uma?

1112
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:37,780
Will you be mine, Uma?

1113
02:29:04,230 --> 02:29:05,530
It's a success!

1114
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:25,070
God, what's happened?

1115
02:29:52,850 --> 02:29:54,250
Will you marry me?

1116
02:29:54,610 --> 02:29:56,460
Will you marry me?
Will you be mine?

1117
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:06,650
So much money!

1118
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:08,366
Will you marry me?

1119
02:30:08,390 --> 02:30:09,886
There's so much money here.

1120
02:30:09,910 --> 02:30:11,510
Everyone will get some. Everyone.

1121
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:14,970
Run!

1122
02:30:15,460 --> 02:30:17,290
If you have the courage,
come and fight.

1123
02:30:18,220 --> 02:30:20,050
- I want money.
- Money.

1124
02:30:20,360 --> 02:30:22,236
You will get money.

1125
02:30:22,260 --> 02:30:23,910
Everyone will get money.

1126
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:29,080
Please, hear the entire story!

1127
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:31,650
Here's your story!

1128
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:35,370
Guard, throw him out!

1129
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:37,410
Get him away from here!

1130
02:30:37,710 --> 02:30:40,110
Father, hear the rest of the story.

1131
02:30:40,250 --> 02:30:44,800
No love! No romance! No lovers!

1132
02:30:45,070 --> 02:30:47,870
If I made that movie,
I'd become a pauper!

1133
02:30:48,170 --> 02:30:52,540
Someday soon we will be
released from your clutches.

1134
02:30:53,160 --> 02:30:57,060
You have harmed the country
with your selfishness and dishonesty.

1135
02:30:57,630 --> 02:31:00,106
You will have to pay the price
very soon!

1136
02:31:00,130 --> 02:31:01,426
Don't get angry.

1137
02:31:01,450 --> 02:31:03,906
If you're so brave why don't
you spend 2 million rupees...

1138
02:31:03,930 --> 02:31:05,370
setting up a studio?

1139
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:07,216
Then you can make your film.

1140
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:09,560
You won't have
to come here begging.

1141
02:31:09,770 --> 02:31:11,840
Out! It's where you belong.

1142
02:31:26,230 --> 02:31:29,240
Beneath this light,
I am standing in darkness.

1143
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:33,616
This bazaar of joy and happiness...

1144
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:35,620
is drowning out the voice of my soul.

1145
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:39,370
My country is drowning.
The world is drowning.

1146
02:31:39,850 --> 02:31:42,340
Humanity can't find a way.

1147
02:31:43,170 --> 02:31:47,150
God, will this country
remain enslaved?

1148
02:31:47,800 --> 02:31:50,570
Will its people never gain sense?

1149
02:31:51,380 --> 02:31:56,290
Will they just quietly
watch the devastation?

1150
02:31:57,550 --> 02:32:00,280
For how long
will my country sleep?

1151
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:04,620
For how long will my dream
remain just a dream?
