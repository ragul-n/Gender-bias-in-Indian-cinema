1
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:12,543
Hey! If you will not meet me,
how will the story go ahead my dear?

2
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:14,210
I am not the care
taker of this college..

3
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,819
..but I am the care
taker of this canteen..

4
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:18,267
My name is M.S..

5
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:22,107
What are you thinking
M.S. Dhoni.. no no..

6
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:24,274
Where does he belong,
and where do I ?

7
00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:26,149
My name is M.S. Hola

8
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,940
That stands for Mehnat
(hardwork) Singh Hola..

9
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:32,501
Why my name is so different,
Mehnat (hardwork) Singh Gola..

10
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,323
Come on let me tell you
the reason for it..

11
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:36,796
the actual reason is..

12
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:41,222
whatever position I am at this
moment is because of my hardwork

13
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:43,748
That the reason I named
myself as Mehnat Singh..

14
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,539
At the reason behind
the title Hola is...

15
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,284
Hola..

16
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:48,816
I still remember the 1st
day of my college..

17
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,280
The festival of Holi..

18
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,212
Everybody was enjoying,
singing and dancing

19
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,167
and also wishing as today is
Happy holi.. Happy Holi..

20
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:58,259
At the same time somebody asked me,
Hola please give me some colour..

21
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:01,389
I thought seeing
to my innocent face..

22
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,710
he is addressing me as Bhola
(innocent), give me some colour..

23
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,168
But he didn't say Bhola..

24
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,570
He said Hola..

25
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,930
And as he said, every nearby
started saying it too me..

26
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:12,267
After that day..

27
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:15,407
Holi splashed this titled
me the name..

28
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:18,186
and I became
Mehnat Singh Hola ever after..

29
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:19,929
-Ok can I ask you something..
- Hmmm...

30
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:25,698
So what I would have been
titled as Lau....

31
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,702
You surely know it what will
be the meaning you brut fellow..

32
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,395
Will slap you hard..

33
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:34,465
Todays generation always
think about double meanings..

34
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:35,827
Literate though illiterate..

35
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:37,224
By the way..

36
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:41,685
If it was Lohari day
then it would be my ....

37
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:42,986
I am telling you the truth..

38
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:45,495
then nobody would have said,
Mama's good boy, is a bad boy..

39
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:48,739
Everyone would have said,
Mama's .... anyways..

40
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,414
today I will not spoil my mood..

41
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:53,957

Anurag Johar's retirement day,

..a place where XXX, we have
no idea what is going to happen?

370
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:44,986
We even don't know whether

371
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:47,446
It will be a ultimate adventure
dude, ultimate..

372
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:51,210
By the way Golu, some day we
all are going to die..

00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,965
-I can't join you all sorry..
-Please buddy.

00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:05,275
Come say yes or
I will slap you now..

377
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:08,781
No buddy I am not a fool,
didn't you see its so risky..

378
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:11,112
I can't go there I am sorry..

379
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:13,833
-Look Boss, we all go together..
-Yes..

380
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:20,500
-Say yes. say it..
-Yess..

381
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,686

the sunset..

382
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:28,436
yes..

383
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:31,524
By the way I want to celebrate
my honeymoon before I die..

384
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:33,606
We will not give you to die..

385
00:30:33,686 --> 00:30:36,174
Ok add my name in the
martyr list..

386
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:41,597
Ok so we have decided then
lets fix the date..

387
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:46,840
Look its written the place
is nearby to Alwar right?

388
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:46,862
Right..

389
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:51,767
So think that this is Alwar
and this is Delhi..

390
00:30:52,342 --> 00:30:55,763
..so the duration between them
is approximate 3 to 3 and half an hour..

391
00:30:55,843 --> 00:30:56,167
Right..

392
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:58,930
Isn't this road too bumpy?

393
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:02,363
Ok the road is too bumpy,
lets go through the flat road, ok ..

394
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,354
No.. no..

395
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:05,828
We can go for a oneday trip..

396
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:08,315
We will start early and
return in the evening..

397
00:31:09,422 --> 00:31:10,799
-sounds good..

398
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:13,547

401
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:21,360

..I will also accompany
you at such a dangerous place..

416

Baby there is no danger, just
listen, and don't misunderstand..

417
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:03,436
Look I have done research on it..

418
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:05,260
Its only dangerous
during night..

419
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,820
and we will be returning
in the day time..

420
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,316
And I will feel nice,
if you come along..

421
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,961
Along with you?

422
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:19,749

442
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:56,532

the flag at Lal Qila?

444
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,940
Papa we are going at a place
where people don't return alive..

445
00:34:20,647 --> 00:34:22,728
From where people don't
return alive?

446

-I will show you the place
where people don't return.. -Papa

-I will show you the place where
people don't return.. -Papa..Papa..

448
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:29,654
You keep watching these

449
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,708
Sorry papa, I was just joking papa..

450
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:38,571
I was just saying it, nothing

451
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,560
By the way papa..

452
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:42,480

457
00:34:57,552 --> 00:34:59,896
Before match starts
3 wickets are down..

458
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,781
Means if Jai comes, Prachi
will end up the relation with him.

459
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:08,993
If this fatso comes his
father will kick his ass..

460
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,663
And Ashu is attending his
annual meeting on this Sunday..

461
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:17,447
so there is no other scope?

462
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:20,898

Guys if there is no other
option then create an option..

465
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:37,359
Waht do you mean?

466
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,816
This means Sunday's plan is
cancel, there is no chance..

467
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:45,640
So will go on Tuesday
instead of Sunday..

468
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,860
..and we all will bunk on that day..

469
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:50,302
and nobody will tell anybody
before or after going..

470
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:53,710
We will enjoy the trip and
have fun..

471
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:56,932
And by chance if we discover
anything it will be a news..

472
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:08,129

-Should I take a turn?
-Take a left..

489
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:01,849
Take a turn.

00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:05,625
-Come on lets go..

00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:07,406

-Biscuits too..
-Yes i will get it for you..

501
00:39:31,865 --> 00:39:34,468
Look a double engine bike..

502
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:38,564
Where is it, its a single engine..

503
00:39:42,355 --> 00:39:45,206
one engine is at the bottom
and one is on the backside..

504
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:47,367
thats the reason
its running in a speed

505
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,272
Ok tell me..

506
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,201
what you guys know
about Bhangarh?

507
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,400
You forget it, you tell me.

508
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:02,299
Aa.. I hope its a beautiful place.

509
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,400
Where I can click good pictures..

510
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:07,707
Its a haunted place, there
will be ghost and what else..

511
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,611
Your guess is right..

512
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:14,651
Shutup..

513
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,974
Her name was Queen Ratnawati..

514
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:24,551
-Ratnawati? Nice name..
-Hmm..

515
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:26,663
This story is about
the king Madhav Singh

516
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,413
Who was the king of Bhangarh
in the 1500 century..

517
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,789
Who got married to
Queen Rani Ratnawati.

518
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:38,595
It is said that Ratnawati was
the most beautiful lady on earth.

519
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:44,660
She was not only famous in Bhangarh
but also in other nearby states..

520
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:55,933
And as she was so beautiful, once
there came a ritual to meet her..

521
00:41:15,817 --> 00:41:17,706
He was in love with her at
the first sight.

522
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:23,582
The ritual thought this ..

523
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,501
this beautiful queen..

524
00:41:25,804 --> 00:41:30,920
shouldn't be with the king ,
but she should be with him..

525
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:42,280
From the same day to
acheive queen Ratnawati..

526
00:41:42,424 --> 00:41:45,620
Ritual started
with his black magic.

527
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:12,392
Queen Ratnawati came to know
about the ritual's black magic..

528
00:42:12,984 --> 00:42:18,313
She decided to punish the ritual and
to teach other people who think him..

529
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:28,709
As ritual was about to die, he cursed
the queen Ratnawati and Bhangarh..

530
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:32,325
Hey! queen Ratnawati..

531
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:35,435
you didn't understand my feelings..

532
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:41,111
after my death,
you will find for love..

533
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:45,903
you will not get the king's
love nor your peoples..

534
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:49,582
And these Bhangarh peoples..

535
00:42:49,948 --> 00:42:52,984
who are watching my death..

536
00:42:53,748 --> 00:42:57,866
As I die they all will also die..

537
00:42:57,986 --> 00:43:03,732
all will be ruined..
the complete Bhangarh will destroy..

538
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:07,871
This is my curse to you..

539
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:09,400
its a curse..

540
00:43:09,614 --> 00:43:13,697
I order to hang him to death...

541
00:43:15,242 --> 00:43:17,960
After ritual's death.

542
00:43:17,602 --> 00:43:20,314
the neighbouring state
attacked on them..

543
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:22,506
so they all were killed..

544
00:43:24,293 --> 00:43:27,272
in olden days if the king dies.

545
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:34,511
the queen would set herself to fire
or drown herself , she did the same..

546
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:37,818
it is been said till date..

547
00:43:37,898 --> 00:43:43,970
..queen Ratnawati and ritual
are there as spirit in the fort..

548
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,683
It is also been said..

549
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,700
in the night..

550
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:52,114
on some special noted days like,
tuesday, full moon and new moon..

551
00:43:52,234 --> 00:43:53,527
on saturdays..

552
00:43:53,826 --> 00:43:56,369
this fort turns into
the same 1500 century

553
00:43:57,314 --> 00:44:00,383
and if any person by mistake,
from this century is present there..

554
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,605
then the person
doen't stay alive..

555
00:44:02,685 --> 00:44:06,628
Oh! my dear, its not too late.

556
00:44:06,748 --> 00:44:08,629
There are good places around..

557
00:44:08,709 --> 00:44:09,984
..we will enjoy and return
back from here itself..

558
00:44:11,596 --> 00:44:13,990
Nothing will go wrong
with you Golu, you relax..

559
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:15,216
Ghosts doesn't have so bad choice..

560
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:20,100
Buddy I am dam scared and
you are busy with your facebook..

561
00:44:20,572 --> 00:44:24,192
Look, I am friendly with
a new bengali girl on facebook..

562
00:44:24,437 --> 00:44:25,533
Shamita Banerjee..

563
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,158
Giving her photography tips..

564
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:29,651
-Is she single?
-No Engaged..

565
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,281
A little effort
then she is all mine..

566
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,156
It means you are constructing your
buidling on someone else's plot..

567
00:44:38,612 --> 00:44:39,620
Very nice..

568
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:41,919
Tell me one thing?

569
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:47,587
How these engaged girls
get interested in a boy like you?

570
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:48,861
Look dear..

571
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:50,268
Its very simple..

572
00:44:50,536 --> 00:44:53,109
If you want to divert
a single girl..

573
00:44:53,361 --> 00:44:57,176
so you have to prove your self
superior then 3 crore boys right?

574
00:44:57,713 --> 00:45:00,931
At the same time if you want
to divert an engaged girl then..

575
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:04,158
you have to only prove yourself
superior then a single boy..

576
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:07,829
Yuck !, does this sound good?
seriously..

577
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:11,165
as one is not allowing so,
he is trying somewhere else..

578
00:45:15,886 --> 00:45:16,982
One more thing..

579
00:45:17,602 --> 00:45:21,136
-In every fort there is an
arcology office.. -Hmmm..

580
00:45:21,446 --> 00:45:25,383
and only this fort doesn't
have arcology office..

581
00:45:25,463 --> 00:45:26,357
what is the reason?

582
00:45:37,606 --> 00:45:41,327
Guys I want to go to the washroom..

583
00:45:42,749 --> 00:45:43,966

584
00:45:44,443 --> 00:45:45,725
come on Golu..

585
00:45:45,805 --> 00:45:47,781
I will take you to
the washroom..

586
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,964
Hey! Ashu you too go along,
help Golu to go for the washroom..

587
00:45:54,342 --> 00:45:56,356
Golu wait I am coming..

588
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,734
Now there will be
a flood in the fields.

589
00:45:58,814 --> 00:45:59,736
I know..

590
00:46:02,388 --> 00:46:08,388
Guys if there is positive energy,
then there is also a negative energy..

591
00:46:08,508 --> 00:46:10,154
You are right..

592
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,590
And these energies are always
moving around us..

593
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:18,737
Might be the energy must be
listing to our talks right now..

594
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:23,597

613
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:38,831
Guys ASI's office..

614
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:53,217
Hmm..

615
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:00,747
Come lets go and see inside.

616
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,321
Indian Archaic Inquiry Office..

617
00:48:06,847 --> 00:48:08,845
Hey! this is the same board
we saw on the internet.

618
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:11,636
Hello..

619
00:48:15,123 --> 00:48:15,665
Hello..

620
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:16,819
-Anyone there?
-Hello..

621
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:18,613
Nobody..

622
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:19,752
Why are you figiting?

623
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:21,671
-Hmm..
-Hello.

624
00:48:22,303 --> 00:48:23,212
No one is here..

625
00:48:26,277 --> 00:48:27,798
Why are you many so
much of noise?

626
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:29,897
We wanted some information
from you.

627
00:48:31,553 --> 00:48:34,172
We have heard that Bhangarh
is a haunted place.

628
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:37,531
Can you give us some authentic
information about it?

629
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:40,632
It has been 5 years at my service..

630
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:44,765
Neither I have seen any ghost, nor
I have heard any stories about it..

631
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,244
and there are ghosts here..

632
00:48:50,492 --> 00:48:53,177
If it isn't true then, like others
why don't you have your office..

633
00:48:53,257 --> 00:48:55,131
..in the Bhangarh fort?

634
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:58,419
Madam its a straight answer..

635
00:48:58,716 --> 00:49:01,767
No officer is ready to
be on duty in the fort..

636
00:49:04,103 --> 00:49:05,675
Then why are they scared?

637
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:07,852
Answer my question..

638
00:49:08,206 --> 00:49:12,281
You people always go to the jungle
or wild life to watch the Lion..

639
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:16,391
-Do you always meet the Lion?
-No..

640
00:49:17,357 --> 00:49:20,559
That doesn't mean
Lion is not there..

641
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:23,372
As the same way,
if I don't find any ghost..

642
00:49:23,452 --> 00:49:26,961
that doesn't mean there
is no ghost.

643
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:30,917
This place is not wrong.

644
00:49:30,998 --> 00:49:32,317
at the same time it is
not correct too..

645
00:49:32,626 --> 00:49:34,541
Remember my words after sunset..

646
00:49:34,621 --> 00:49:36,819
..your own shadow will
also not accompany you..

647
00:49:38,582 --> 00:49:39,769
-Thank you sir..
-Welcome..

648
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:40,876
-Come..
-Come..

649
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:46,268
This fellow was looking more like
Shahrukh Khan instead of ASI officer.

650
00:49:49,706 --> 00:49:51,876
God bless you..

651
00:50:00,925 --> 00:50:02,446
Hey! the gate is open..

652
00:50:03,497 --> 00:50:05,538
Bro I want only to things..

653
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:09,641
One is Ratnawati and another is the
story, then my life is set boss..

654
00:50:09,721 --> 00:50:11,590
Bloody, you are not able
to handle Prachi..

655
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:12,930
And you want Ratnawati..

656
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:15,764
Very true she is no
lesser then Ratnawati..

657
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:20,596
As we enter the fort here is
the Lord Hanuman's temple.

658
00:50:20,677 --> 00:50:24,232
Yet we haven't seen any human
being here, lets see further..

659
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:34,413
What a view..

660
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:38,471
And finally we are here
in Bhangarh fort..

661
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:43,727
Hey! Ratnawati and the ritual please
forgive us as we are here for a story..

662
00:50:44,883 --> 00:50:47,644
Still haven't felt
any negative energy..

663
00:50:48,387 --> 00:50:50,628
In the night this place
turns into a market..

664
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:56,550
And this fort, return's
back to the 1500th century..

665
00:51:06,153 --> 00:51:07,341
Come on..

666
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,531
-We have reached Bhangarh where
there is this stick.. -Bhangarh..

667
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:14,969
Where we are going
to meet Ratnawati.

668
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,607
That is the ritual's den.

669
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:20,455
Wow..

670
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:22,388
Ritual used to sit there..

671
00:51:22,468 --> 00:51:25,287
And he would see Ratnawati
from his place..

672
00:51:25,531 --> 00:51:27,777
He must be a dead lover,
I am telling you..

673
00:51:27,857 --> 00:51:30,900
Stop it buddy, stop
joking around..

674
00:51:30,314 --> 00:51:32,468
-Its too much now.. -Hey!
you are scared every moment buddy.

675
00:51:32,615 --> 00:51:33,634
Relaxed, nothing
will go wrong..

676
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,273
See now we have found
the fort, so will return back..

677
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:36,540
The main fort is there..

678
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,777
Fort is about to come..

679
00:51:37,857 --> 00:51:40,615
Alright the fort is here
but the door is her..

680
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,649
Welcome enter the door.

681
00:51:50,758 --> 00:51:55,488
-My beloved.. my beloved..

682
00:51:55,568 --> 00:52:00,680
-Wow!
-My beloved, oh! my beloved..

683
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,481
What you will sing

684
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:07,796
-The world is so beautiful..
- Tuneless fellows..

685
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:13,219
-Tune buddy.. -If you are there then
this world is more beautiful..

686
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:16,953
-I am sorrry..- If you are there then
this world is more beautiful..

687
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:18,561
Bro, tell me onething..

688
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:20,963
If the beloved is one we
can sing this song..

689
00:52:21,387 --> 00:52:23,739
But if the beloved are many
then which song should it be..

690
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:26,413
Its simple..

691
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,745
My beloved's...

692
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:36,731
My beloved's...My beloved's...
My beloved's...

693

Look at your expression,

758
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:31,174
Hey! i am fine,
I was just testing you all.

You all be so brave all time,

760
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,250
Bloody witch..

761
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:43,257
Listen, we will make a move from
here, anyways there is nothing here..

762
00:57:43,337 --> 00:57:47,830
I have gone through the fort for network,
Mangu and internet made a fool of us..

763
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:53,110
Come on lets go, get up what are
you looking at me? come on, come on..

764
00:57:58,272 --> 00:58:01,147
Guys I think there is no witch here..

765
00:58:02,507 --> 00:58:04,385
If we would wait at the night
I would get some story..

766
00:58:04,465 --> 00:58:07,756
..but Golu is scared, I missed it ..

767
00:58:08,224 --> 00:58:11,236
-Hey! jaadu did you get anything?
-No buddy..

768
00:58:11,837 --> 00:58:12,980
What is this Ratnawati..

769
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:18,895
we are your guest and you didn't host
us nor you showed your auspicious sight..

770
00:58:20,298 --> 00:58:24,645

00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:42,946
How much will you bet, there is
Ratnawati or ritual inside the blanket..

781
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:48,620
I am not a coward..

782
00:59:49,555 --> 00:59:53,530
Now I will be the first one to
tell who is behind the blanket..

783
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,462
Go..

784
00:59:57,776 --> 00:59:58,903
Golu take care..

785
01:00:02,909 --> 01:00:04,200
Golu be careful..

786
01:00:04,586 --> 01:00:06,298
Golu, no Golu..

787
01:00:08,234 --> 01:00:09,444
Golu be careful..

788
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,312
No, Golu..

789
01:00:23,363 --> 01:00:24,281
Golu..

790
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:33,651
Are you ok?

791
01:00:35,425 --> 01:00:39,684
Buddy I don't know about the ghost but
the human's are very dangerous here..

792
01:00:40,227 --> 01:00:42,171
Some mad man, come on lets go..

793
01:00:42,251 --> 01:00:43,494
Come on..

794
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,913
-No he was a ghost..
-Leave me..

795
01:01:01,315 --> 01:01:02,316
Should I call him?

796
01:01:07,377 --> 01:01:11,403
Have you all seen the movie,
"Final Destination"?

797
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,848
-Yes..
-Yes we have seen..

798
01:01:12,928 --> 01:01:16,243
A moment, I havn't but why are
you remembering it now?

799
01:01:17,918 --> 01:01:22,678
In Final destiantion movie 5
friends go for a trip, as we are..

800
01:01:23,454 --> 01:01:29,200
They survive from the trip,
but then later they get killed..

801
01:01:31,853 --> 01:01:32,777
So?

802
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:37,913
Buddy we all were making
so much fun of Ratnawati..

803
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:39,843
Kavya also invited her..

804
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:44,849
If she really enters our life then?

805
01:01:45,162 --> 01:01:46,935
Or if she kills us?

806
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:49,433
Please dont laugh, I am serious.

807
01:01:49,513 --> 01:01:52,172
-Buddy you are with us or you
are doing publicity for the ghost?

808
01:01:52,252 --> 01:01:54,703
-Excatly.. -Hey! Jai stop
the jeep and ask him to get off..

809
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:58,763
Whats the matter..

810
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:01,913
-Whats the matter bro?
-Jai?

811
01:02:02,244 --> 01:02:03,665
Jai..

812
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:31,299
Come on lets go there
is nothing here..

813
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,457
You coward..

814
01:02:36,431 --> 01:02:37,651
You fatso..

815
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:45,609
-Golu come on..
Golu come sit in the jeep..

816
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:48,805
There is nothing around
we just played prank on you..

817
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:53,763
Your wife will leave you
for the first night..

818
01:03:02,457 --> 01:03:05,212
You are bunking around..

819
01:03:05,459 --> 01:03:07,000
It doesn't disturb your work?

820
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:09,580
Don't take tension

821
01:03:09,178 --> 01:03:12,950
people set assistant under,
I have appointed Manager upon me..

822
01:03:12,175 --> 01:03:13,695
He works for me..

823
01:03:13,878 --> 01:03:15,671
You make the manager work?

824
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,697
Teach us something..

825
01:03:20,854 --> 01:03:24,904
Its simple, there are two ways
to earn money by your body.

826
01:03:25,346 --> 01:03:27,576
Don't think rubbish..

827
01:03:27,656 --> 01:03:32,436
Previously people would earn
through physical activity..

828
01:03:32,516 --> 01:03:37,816
Now people earn with their brains..

829
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:43,903
And so the thing is my
manager is such a big fool..

830
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:48,673
If I just praise him a little
he just goes crazy..

831
01:03:48,753 --> 01:03:50,953
and he is such a nut doen't come
to know that I am making fool of him..

832
01:03:52,504 --> 01:03:55,319
-I call him sales bond..
-Bond?

833
01:03:55,814 --> 01:03:59,524
In college days we would make
some boys work like donkeys ..

834
01:03:59,605 --> 01:04:01,595
and we would name
them as bond..

835
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:03,150
So that we both are happy..

836
01:04:03,569 --> 01:04:05,361
Hey where isthe dustbin?

837
01:04:07,662 --> 01:04:13,410
Ok I am sales bond and many more,
thank you Mr. Ashu..

838
01:04:13,637 --> 01:04:16,657
for give me so may titles.

839
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:22,165
These are manners, that
I didn't slap you..

840
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:25,610
Please send me your resignation,
immediately..

841
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:26,879
I am really sorry sir..

842
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:30,259
You want me to send
your termination?

843
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:41,219
Jai I want talk to you..

844
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:42,942
Give me two minutes..

845
01:04:43,327 --> 01:04:45,236
I want to talk to you
write now..

846
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:47,774
Prachi..

847
01:04:49,229 --> 01:04:50,272
How come you are here?

848
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,901
Whats the matter you are here
of a sudden? I am working..

849
01:04:59,234 --> 01:05:00,380
Prachi..

850
01:05:00,218 --> 01:05:02,647
I warn you if you call me ..

851
01:05:02,727 --> 01:05:04,473
Prachi is no more for you..

852
01:05:04,554 --> 01:05:07,489
-Why are you crying?
-Jai please..

853
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:09,310
don't create a drama..

854
01:05:09,742 --> 01:05:13,195
I told you not to go
to Bhangarh..

855
01:05:13,723 --> 01:05:15,798
Though you went..

856
01:05:16,374 --> 01:05:19,899
-There is no value for you if I die?
-It is..

857
01:05:19,979 --> 01:05:24,202
-Sorry Jai, We are not made for
eachother.. -Prachi listen..

858
01:05:24,282 --> 01:05:29,301
-It was just a sudden plan, and
Kavya said.. - Kavya .. Kavya.. Kavya..

859
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:36,200
She has just ruined my whole life, now
go to her and ask her for your love..

860
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:38,370
Go enjoy with her..

861
01:05:38,812 --> 01:05:41,820
Atleast listen to me once..

862
01:05:41,162 --> 01:05:46,870
i don't want to hear anything,
don't utter a word..

863
01:05:46,168 --> 01:05:50,114
I will kill myself,
this relation is over..

864
01:07:49,135 --> 01:07:54,460
Its just a tension for a day,
it will go away..

865
01:07:54,985 --> 01:07:59,705
Please make up your mood,
specially you Jai..

866
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:04,683
If Prachi is angry we will
think over it, and make her up..

867
01:08:07,787 --> 01:08:11,437
Looking at his situation
i will tell you a joke..

868
01:08:11,808 --> 01:08:15,347
One day one groccer goes for a
morning walk with his dog

869
01:08:15,806 --> 01:08:17,923
at the same time a
man passes by and says..

870
01:08:23,143 --> 01:08:25,627
so the groccer says,
brother yes its the lion..

871
01:08:25,886 --> 01:08:30,617
but the day he is in love he
seems to be like a dog..

872
01:08:31,935 --> 01:08:34,107
I am not saying
that you are a dog..

873
01:08:34,346 --> 01:08:36,649
I am jsut jokking..

874
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:37,916
Whats a joke in it?

875
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:39,876
-What?
-you think everything is a joke?

876
01:08:39,957 --> 01:08:41,733
-Jai just joking..
-Shut up ya..

877
01:08:41,813 --> 01:08:42,788
-Just trying to lighten up..
-Shut up just shut up..

878
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:46,658
Its enough, you think you are too
smart? you think you can say anything?

879
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:50,170
-Look I was just joking.. -This is
life, and nothing to joke around..

880
01:08:50,612 --> 01:08:53,350
Do you know, the reason
behind from breakup is only you..

881
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:57,292
-Hello.. -We had already
cancelled the Trip to Bhangarh..

882
01:08:57,805 --> 01:08:59,678
You only planned it again..

883
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:01,518
You have no idea what
I am going through..

884
01:09:02,854 --> 01:09:05,510
You would only understand the
feelings if you ever loved anyone..

885
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:08,270
Jai listen.

886
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:10,898
Why are you only blaming
on her?

887
01:09:11,491 --> 01:09:14,595
Are you a kid? you decided
on self to go..

888
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:17,107
You wanted to be the real
journalist..

889
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:18,985
You didn't get the news, so now
you are finding for her fault?

890
01:09:21,205 --> 01:09:22,651
You will definetly be on her side..

891
01:09:23,524 --> 01:09:27,146
Why only her, you would take any
girl's side in she was in her place..

892
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:29,215
You are such a dead lover..

893
01:09:29,295 --> 01:09:33,710
if there is a paper written girl, you
will be on the paper's side not us..

894
01:09:33,151 --> 01:09:34,697
-You bloody fatso..
-Jaadu..

895
01:09:34,778 --> 01:09:36,779
-Guys, what are you all doing?
-Get out you..

896
01:09:36,859 --> 01:09:37,786
A moment.

897
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:43,276
What are you doing Jaadu?

898
01:09:43,356 --> 01:09:46,500
Buddy he just keeps blaming me
in some ot the other's names

899
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,567
Buddy all are scared why are
you over reacting?

900
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:49,986
I am not over reacting..

901
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:53,600
He is axised wrongly,
just answering to it..

902
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:57,763
If things are correct they are,
and if they are wrong then its wrong..

903
01:09:59,347 --> 01:10:02,971
And if you don't understand the
things, then hell with your friendship..

904
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:07,293
Hey!, what are you staring at,
there's the exit door get out..

905
01:10:07,373 --> 01:10:09,299
-Golu quiet..
-Golu..

906
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,382
-Even I am not interested in you..
-Hey!

907
01:10:11,462 --> 01:10:14,121
Golu.. what are you people upto?

908
01:10:14,201 --> 01:10:18,578
BloodyXXX, are you out
of your brain?

909
01:10:19,153 --> 01:10:21,150
Come lets go and stop him.

910
01:10:23,409 --> 01:10:24,929
-Come on Golu please come..
-Huh!..

911
01:10:26,997 --> 01:10:29,101
Jaadu... Jaa.

912
01:10:31,788 --> 01:10:33,857
Jaadu.. Jaa.. Jaadu..

913
01:10:59,126 --> 01:11:01,855
You all are waiting
to welcome me?

914
01:11:03,829 --> 01:11:06,119
What's the matter any tension?

915
01:11:06,378 --> 01:11:09,307
Tension is always in and out,
anyways what are you doing here?

916
01:11:09,787 --> 01:11:14,380
Oh! yes Jaadu asked me to
get reunion's DVD..

917
01:11:14,118 --> 01:11:19,821
He invited me at Golu's place, so
I am here, and see now he left away..

918
01:11:20,272 --> 01:11:22,580
Don't utter a word about the reunion..

919
01:11:23,182 --> 01:11:24,294
If we wouldn't go to the
reunion party it was better..

920
01:11:24,374 --> 01:11:26,539
Nor we could get news about Bhangarh.

921
01:11:26,931 --> 01:11:28,250
And nor this mess would happen..

922
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:32,281
Hey! Bangarh.. the same one
from Mangu's story?

923
01:11:32,361 --> 01:11:33,907
Yes that jinx place Bhangarh..

924
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,519
From the day we have return
from there, we all are out of brains..

925
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:47,745
Then how come Bhangarh?

926
01:11:48,422 --> 01:11:49,897
We thought Mangu is talking fraud..

927
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:54,669
But as we surf on internet, it
sounded interesting so we all went..

928
01:11:55,234 --> 01:11:56,856
But nothing went wrong
when we went..

929
01:11:57,729 --> 01:12:01,674
The day we are back,
we all are disturbed..

930
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:03,426
Shit..

931
01:12:04,443 --> 01:12:07,219
-I can't believe this..
-Now whats wrong with you?

932
01:12:08,497 --> 01:12:11,801
Aa.. answer my question..

933
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:16,334
-Buddies you all 5 went there?
-Yes..

934
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:19,960
-4 boys and 1 girl?
-Yes.

935
01:12:20,464 --> 01:12:24,161
And before going there
did you all made a video?

936
01:12:24,378 --> 01:12:26,558
-What are you trying to say?
-No.. I mean..

937
01:12:26,839 --> 01:12:28,550
Tell me onething..

938
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:31,577
After returning,
later 10 to 12 days ..

939
01:12:31,697 --> 01:12:33,540
Did anything negative happen
with anyone of you?

940
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,790
I lost my job..

941
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:39,240
He had a breakup, but how
you know all this?

942
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:42,628
Waht are you trying to say?
speak clearly dont't irritate.

943
01:12:49,346 --> 01:12:50,347
-So..
-So?

944
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:52,250
-So..
-So...!

945
01:12:52,492 --> 01:12:57,000
You all didn't listen to his
story, but I did..

946
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:04,384
-He is talking rubbish..
-I saying the truth.

947
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:09,701
I swear, I remember Mangu's
each and every word..

948
01:13:09,781 --> 01:13:13,906
And what all is happening with
you, is same in the story..

949
01:13:14,442 --> 01:13:21,910
5 friends, decide to go to
Bhangarh without informing anyone..

950
01:13:21,653 --> 01:13:23,805
They all were unaware..

951
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:27,851
About the negative power
attracting them towards it..

952
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:35,547
they make their video before going,
and capture their selves in the camera.

953
01:13:38,587 --> 01:13:42,772
So they assume there is no
ghosts in this world..

954
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:48,348
But later returing,
within 10 to 12 days..

955
01:13:48,613 --> 01:13:51,920
Their life starts changing..

956
01:13:52,274 --> 01:13:53,896
They have no idea..

957
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:57,299
But the Ratnawati,
queen of Bhangarh..

958
01:13:57,947 --> 01:14:00,671
She follows them in their life..

959
01:14:06,715 --> 01:14:08,194
Someone has a breakup..

960
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:10,487
They have a fight between them..

961
01:14:10,759 --> 01:14:17,340
And yes, one causes an
accident and gets a facture..

962
01:14:17,377 --> 01:14:20,322
Hey! What rubbish
are you talking..

963
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:24,804
He is talking rubbish,
his starting word is wrong..

964
01:14:24,884 --> 01:14:29,519
-We didn't go at the new moon night..
-Which date did we go ?

965
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,308
A moment, its was 19th
the day was tuesday..

966
01:14:33,658 --> 01:14:38,820
19th? accordingly to Hindi calendar
it can be the new moon night..

967
01:14:38,332 --> 01:14:41,687
Guys he is right, it was the
new moon night..

968
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:42,552
What?

969
01:14:48,227 --> 01:14:51,159
Fine, but it can be a coincident?

970
01:14:51,517 --> 01:14:56,456
Accordingly to him, someone would have
a fracture but look we 4 are fine?

971
01:14:56,537 --> 01:14:58,520
You were talking about
a bone fracture..

972
01:14:58,132 --> 01:15:01,700
-Everything is fine?
-I am just telling you..

973
01:15:07,318 --> 01:15:09,336
-Shit..
- What happen?

974
01:15:10,308 --> 01:15:15,678
-Yes .. we all will be there right now..
-What happen?

975
01:15:15,758 --> 01:15:19,617
Guys Jaadu met with an accident
and possibly he has a fracture..

976
01:15:24,465 --> 01:15:26,534
What was further in
Mangu's story?

977
01:15:27,846 --> 01:15:29,414
Come on speak up..

978
01:15:29,534 --> 01:15:34,644
I don't know what was further, Mangu
said he is still writing the climax..

979
01:15:34,725 --> 01:15:39,169
I told you this is happening same
as the movie Final Destination..

980
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:42,823
All will die, nobody will
survive, all will die..

981
01:15:42,903 --> 01:15:44,993
-Golu you be calm..
-Get lost..

982
01:15:48,389 --> 01:15:50,442
-Golu..
-I didn't even inform my parents..

983
01:15:50,522 --> 01:15:53,288
-Golu..
-Not I will die..

984
01:15:53,368 --> 01:15:55,409
-Golu..
-Get lost..

985
01:15:55,826 --> 01:15:58,567
-What you all are fighting like a kid?
-Because I am a Kid..

986
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:00,549
Jaadu met with an accident..

987
01:16:03,362 --> 01:16:07,432
-Come guys.. -Get lost, I
don't want anybody in my house..

988
01:16:07,512 --> 01:16:08,967
-Yes we are going..
-Leave..

989
01:16:09,726 --> 01:16:11,870
-Come on..
-Lets go guys..

990
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:15,850
I have been alone for so many years,
I can live without you all, just go..

991
01:16:34,821 --> 01:16:36,638
I just went blank.

992
01:16:38,325 --> 01:16:42,272
I felt as if someone pulled
my bike from behind..

993
01:16:43,462 --> 01:16:44,658
I was.. I was helpless.

994
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:48,545
Doesn't matter, Thankfully
you are not too injured.

995
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,474
I never knew..

996
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:55,310
it will be a mess.

997
01:17:04,878 --> 01:17:07,206
We all have only one way to do..

998
01:17:07,286 --> 01:17:12,720
We will college and gert Mangu's
address from the register, and find him..

999
01:17:12,331 --> 01:17:14,500
Yes buddy, lets go..

1000
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:17,870
Yes lets go, come on..

1001
01:17:17,496 --> 01:17:19,332
Its Golu's father.

1002
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:24,498
Hello uncle..

1003
01:17:24,578 --> 01:17:28,579
Listen within 15 minutes you all be at
my place, is that clear to you Jai?

1004
01:17:28,659 --> 01:17:30,732
-Yes uncle.. -I want
to speak urgently regarding Bhangarh.

1005
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:32,351
-Yes, alright..

1006
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:40,280
-Oh!..
-Oh!..

1007
01:17:41,595 --> 01:17:43,140
Come on he is calling.

1008
01:18:20,559 --> 01:18:23,680
This atmospher is pure now..

1009
01:18:24,606 --> 01:18:28,387
We will not be harmed
by any negative vibes.

1010
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,382
Now we can speak..

1011
01:18:30,674 --> 01:18:32,568
Nothing will be wrong
with my son?

1012
01:18:32,648 --> 01:18:36,282
You don't worry,
your son will be safe..

1013
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:39,495
If he does what I say..

1014
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,719
What do you all know
about Bhangarh?

1015
01:18:51,346 --> 01:18:57,172
The Ritual, Ratnawati,
Madhav Singh, or..

1016
01:18:57,645 --> 01:19:01,993
that if anybody stays behind
there is not alive next day, isn't it?

1017
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:10,815
Is it possible what ever
is written in the story..

1018
01:19:10,895 --> 01:19:13,246
..will happen in their real life?

1019
01:19:13,758 --> 01:19:15,345
Yes it is possible.

1020
01:19:16,304 --> 01:19:17,789
I will tell you.

1021
01:19:18,349 --> 01:19:26,118
The boy who wrote the story is been
haunted by Bhangarh black magic..

1022
01:19:26,318 --> 01:19:27,896
At the party night..

1023
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:29,929
As you all said..

1024
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:35,700
You all joked about the place and
the person's belonging to the place..

1025
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:39,430
so automatically you
became part of the story..

1026
01:19:39,194 --> 01:19:45,610
You were thinking, you all
were planning trip to Bhangarh.

1027
01:19:45,652 --> 01:19:50,969
Actually it was the power which
was attracting you all towards it..

1028
01:19:51,178 --> 01:19:54,315
What nonsense there is no
black magic and such..

1029
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:59,137
Tommorow we will meet Mangu
and sort all this out..

1030
01:19:59,217 --> 01:20:00,330
Everything will be clear..

1031
01:20:01,377 --> 01:20:05,328
And we all don't believe in
this stupidy, so please..

1032
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:10,835
-We are going.. -I can
understand your this behaviour..

1033
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:12,420
Its all because of your age..

1034
01:20:22,663 --> 01:20:24,885
you have to surrender
yourself to me to solve it ..

1035
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:29,768
Madam calm down, we will not
surrender or come down to anybody.

1036
01:20:29,968 --> 01:20:33,798
Son, you were not suppose to
go to Bhangarh either.

1037
01:20:33,878 --> 01:20:35,275

When the death is near, one
behaves or acts with deluded mind...

address when we were in Jaipur..

It is true that Mangu was writing
a script for them on Bhangarh..

1206
01:40:14,896 --> 01:40:18,340
But not a feature, or a fiction,
it was just a doumentary..

That means you are
saying Chiru is a dog?

1246
01:43:57,368 --> 01:44:00,440
When did I say he is barking..

1247
01:44:02,281 --> 01:44:06,434
The Superman is in the sky
and doberman is on the ground..

1248
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:15,700
I thought of adding
poison in your drinks.

1249
01:44:17,511 --> 01:44:20,421
But I couln't do anything,
nothing..

1250

01:44:36,766 --> 01:44:38,807
I came to Bhangarh..

1254
01:44:39,531 --> 01:44:44,507
He told me correct,

1255
01:44:44,627 --> 01:44:48,240
And made a video before
going there..

1256
01:44:49,382 --> 01:44:52,339
So I hired a killer.

1257
01:44:52,419 --> 01:44:58,369
Your jeep got punctured, you didn't
find any ghost there, I saw all this..

1258
01:44:59,673 --> 01:45:03,678
-I will kill her..
-No Chiru..

1259
01:45:03,908 --> 01:45:10,867
I was trying to kill you all,
but you were lucky..

1260
01:45:13,912 --> 01:45:19,337
Then I saw Bhangarh is
in your mind.

1261
01:45:19,785 --> 01:45:21,818
Then I remembered
Mangu's story..

1262
01:45:22,321 --> 01:45:25,680
I made a plan out of Bhangarh..

1263
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:34,513
I only sent a photograph
to your girlfriend..

1264
01:45:41,744 --> 01:45:43,677
I did your breakup..

1265
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:47,108
You had manager as your
boss right Ashu?

1266
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:51,540
Did you learn a lesson,

01:46:20,832 --> 01:46:23,502
Do you know why did he die?

1274
01:46:25,536 --> 01:46:27,692
He sacrificed his life..

1275
01:46:28,306 --> 01:46:29,748
Sacrificed his life?

1276
01:46:29,828 --> 01:46:33,569
That all your fault..

1277
01:46:34,383 --> 01:46:36,513
Mangu sacrificed his life.

1278
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:41,225
Mangu died because of you all..

1279
01:46:41,305 --> 01:46:45,607

1280
