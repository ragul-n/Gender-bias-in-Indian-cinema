1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,542
23.976

2
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:50,541
If your shadow exists on someone...

3
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:55,625
...how can he be hurt? Even
death cannot touch him.

4
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,124
Mr. Sam was a very good man.

5
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,041
God knows what happened to him.

6
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,124
What is to happen?

7
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,500
Even he must have gone
up like the others.

8
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,000
Whatever you say. Those
days were so nice too.

9
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,791
Now, we only have memoirs left.

10
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:25,041
Yes, we have only memoirs now.

11
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:30,041
Go.

12
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:41,166
Yes?
- Comb your hair at least.

13
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,916
I don't roam around with a
comb like you at this age.

14
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:49,292
Me? And a comb?

15
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,167
Yes? - We... - Good morning, Madam.
We... all of us, actually...

16
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,791
All of us have come for the job.

17
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:03,959
Oh! Yes. Actually I don't
remember anything nowadays.

18
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,124
I forget everything.

19
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:10,874
Come. Come... Come...

20
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:16,208
I didn't expect you
to come so early.

21
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:24,707
I am Martha Pinto. Edgar Willis.

22
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,124
Okay, you are the gardener. - Yes.

23
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,791
This is Maria D'souza.

24
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,791
You know the household
chores, isn't it?

25
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,917
She is very young to look at,
but she is very sharp at work.

26
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,415
You do the household
jobs, isn't it?

27
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:44,958
What is the matter?
Why don't you talk?

28
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,749
Madam, she cannot talk.
But you won't...

29
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,750
...have any complaints in her work.

30
00:04:56,208 --> 00:05:00,084
It seems that there is nobody
to clean the house since long.

31
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,625
There was everyone a week
back. But I don't know.

32
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,749
Everyone disappeared
all of a sudden.

33
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,916
They disappeared?

34
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:10,916
Yes. Neither did they tell
me anything and nor...

35
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:14,291
...did they notify me. They didn't
even take their salary.

36
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:20,749
They just left us.

37
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,832
Yes. It is very strange.

38
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,874
Please come.

39
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,874
You will understand pretty quickly...

40
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,749
...that this house isn't like
other common houses. - Yes.

41
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,290
It is a bit different.

42
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,749
Therefore, I had given
an ad in the newspaper.

43
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,207
That I needed good
and honest people.

44
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,667
You will find us to be as
you had thought to be.

45
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,083
Isn't it, Eddie?

46
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:46,083
You won't find any complaints
in our work, madam.

47
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:48,041
And this is the kitchen.

48
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,874
I have my break fast
at nine O' clock.

49
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,415
And the kids have their breakfast
at ten O' clock.

50
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:56,249
The lunch is at One O' clock
and the dinner is at eight.

51
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,875
Your husband?

52
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:05,291
He has gone to war.
He is in the army.

53
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,249
Therefore, he had to go.

54
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,916
The war is over since a long time.

55
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:14,916
But we haven't found out
anything about him.

56
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:20,375
It is a matter of great sorrow.

57
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:26,542
Who out of you cook?

58
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:32,375
Please come.

59
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:39,750
You must be thinking
what I am up to.

60
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,999
Not a single door of this
house will open...

61
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,916
...till the time you don't
close it properly.

62
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:51,374
And closing means closing
it properly.

63
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:56,250
By locking it.

64
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,249
And yes. This isn't
such an easy task.

65
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,165
Because this house
has fifteen doors...

66
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,041
...and therefore, fifteen
keys. It is...

67
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:08,958
...very important to know which
key has to be used when.

68
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,417
You will get one
set of the keys tomorrow.

69
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:19,166
And this is our piano.
But this isn't played.

70
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,250
Frank likes it a lot.

71
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,958
But please take care that the
children don't touch it.

72
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,290
Because I get excited
by any loud noise.

73
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,457
And therefore, my migraine
attack starts.

74
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,332
Therefore, silence is extremely
important for me.

75
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,499
And you people will take care of it.

76
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,416
Therefore, you won't see
a TV, radio or telephone.

77
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:50,374
In fact, I have even
cut the electricity.

78
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,833
There are kids, how
can they be believed?

79
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,999
They can make anything
light anywhere.

80
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,082
We have made a habit
of staying the dark.

81
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,249
Come, I will show you
the rest of the...

82
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,916
You don't need to show
us the whole house.

83
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,416
It is necessary.

84
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,916
There will be darkness
here most of the time.

85
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:11,249
It is possible that you trip
over some chair or table.

86
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,457
Or, it is even possible that my
kids be playing hide and seek.

87
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,207
I didn't quite understand, madam.

88
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:22,292
You will understand. Come on.

89
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,541
Yes, madam? - You will
get all the materials...

90
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,040
...for gardening in the
shed down below.

91
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,916
If you want something else,
please tell me.

92
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:36,040
Yes, madam.

93
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:40,207
And you. Please close
all the curtains.

94
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:45,500
All of them? - Yes.

95
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,625
Please come.

96
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,916
I will wake the children up.

97
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:19,541
Whatever happens, don't
open the curtains.

98
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:24,375
Yes.

99
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,207
Come on, get up, child.
- Let me sleep!

100
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:34,083
David, see. Someone
has come to meet you.

101
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,582
Who is it? - Get up. Yes.

102
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:43,375
Please come.

103
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:50,416
They are sleeping still.

104
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,249
They are sweet kids.

105
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,375
You didn't greet them.

106
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:03,000
I am Martha Pinto.
And she is Maria.

107
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:06,583
And what is your name?

108
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:11,124
Tell them your name.

109
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,457
Wow! Your names are so sweet.

110
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,583
Sarah and David.

111
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:21,583
Are you our new nanny?

112
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:27,165
Yes, child. I am your new nanny.

113
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,584
Maria, go down and lay the
break fast. And listen.

114
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:37,792
Take this candle with you. You
shouldn't crash against anything.

115
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:47,542
See. I have to take so much care.
- About what, madam?

116
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,332
Their eyes.

117
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,165
Why? What has happened
to their eyes?

118
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,541
They are nice and proper.

119
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:59,000
They have some allergy. I showed
it to a lot of doctors.

120
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,583
But there isn't any cure for it.

121
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:06,583
What kind of illness is it,
which doesn't have any cure?

122
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:08,207
Light.

123
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,584
The light, Mrs. Pinto. They
are allergic to light.

124
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,374
If they are exposed to
light all of a sudden...

125
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,584
...their bodies will develop
ulcers and scratches.

126
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:24,040
They will start choking.

127
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:29,500
And Mrs. Pinto, they can die too.

128
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,541
What is this, child?

129
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:34,124
You haven't finished your
break fast till now?

130
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,583
I don't like this break fast.

131
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:39,249
Why? Why don't you like
this break fast?

132
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,249
Because this isn't tasty.

133
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,249
The break fast before
this was very tasty.

134
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,291
The break fast before
this was tasty...

135
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,249
...because someone else used
to prepare it before.

136
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,332
So then, when will they
come back, Nanny?

137
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,666
They won't be coming back.

138
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:58,833
Just like papa. - Papa will be
back. He will surely return.

139
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:02,249
He has gone to the war.

140
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,667
That's it. Stop talking now.
Finish your breakfast.

141
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,249
You won't be leaving us,
will you, nanny?

142
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,249
No, child. Why will I leave you?

143
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,667
All of them used to say this.
But they left us.

144
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,416
That's it. Don't tell
anything further.

145
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:25,208
What happened, child? - Don't tell
anything! - You keep quiet.

146
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,249
My mummy had gone crazy.
- Nothing happened!

147
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,041
Why didn't it happen? - It didn't!
- It had! It had!

148
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,166
It didn't, it didn't, and it
didn't! - Didn't I tell you, it had?

149
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,207
What is the matter? - Keep
quiet, both of you.

150
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,666
Why is there such a noise?
And what is this?

151
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,458
Why haven't you finished
your breakfast till now?

152
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,583
Come on. Complete it quickly now.

153
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,291
Will you come out for a moment?

154
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:57,750
I want to talk to you
about something.

155
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:04,583
Didn't you know what mummy
said? Nothing happened.

156
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,416
As you know that this place
is away from the city.

157
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:11,541
Therefore, it is impossible for me...

158
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,332
...to go to the city now and again.

159
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,499
And then...

160
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,374
I cannot leave these kids alone too.

161
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,374
You are right. You shouldn't
leave them too.

162
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,832
Yes. But this doesn't mean that...

163
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,249
...I shouldn't have any contact
with the outside world.

164
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,499
Every week, my person comes...

165
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,666
...and takes my letters to the city.

166
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,374
But today...

167
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,416
Today, when I opened
the letter box...

168
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:40,332
...I saw that my letters are
here still. They didn't go.

169
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,583
What do you wish to say?
I don't understand.

170
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:48,416
I will explain the meaning,
Miss. Pinto.

171
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:49,583
This letter.

172
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:52,416
It should have reached five
days ago to the Daily...

173
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:56,707
...Times office. Do you know what
is written in this letter?

174
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:01,541
This letter has the advertisement.

175
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,583
This letter should
have reached the...

176
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:07,583
...Daily Times office five days ago.

177
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:10,874
But when the letter didn't reach...

178
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,583
...how would the advertisement
be printed?

179
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:15,374
I am right, isn't it? - Yes.

180
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,749
And when this letter isn't printed...

181
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,416
...will you please be kind
enough to tell me...

182
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:24,000
...who you people are and
what are you doing here?

183
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:28,624
I understand what you
wish to say now.

184
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,208
We were about to tell you the
day we came in this house.

185
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,499
But you didn't give
us a chance to speak.

186
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,250
Okay, you have a chance
now. Tell me.

187
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:43,458
We came here, thinking that staff...

188
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:47,416
...is needed in such
a big house always.

189
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:49,333
And such a staff...

190
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:53,333
...which should take care
of the house responsibly.

191
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:56,541
We didn't think that
we would get a job.

192
00:14:56,542 --> 00:15:00,291
So you have worked in such
a house previously too?

193
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:03,333
Yes. You will be surprised
to know it...

194
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:07,082
...that we had worked in this
house previously too.

195
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,416
What? In this same house?

196
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:12,583
Yes. Ma'am. A couple of years ago.

197
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:14,333
Believe me.

198
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:17,416
Those years were the best
years of our life.

199
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:22,333
That's it. Thinking that,
we came here once again.

200
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:25,375
I have some work certificates.
Would you wish to see them?

201
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,707
No. That won't be needed.

202
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:33,875
So, you know this house
very nicely? - Yes.

203
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,459
Nicely and completely. As it is,
nothing has changed here.

204
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,750
Everything is as it is.
- Except light.

205
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:51,000
Light in this house...
it is all so difficult.

206
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:57,000
Sometimes, it feels that
nothing is in our hands.

207
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,540
And one day...

208
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,582
Forget it. If we think
about it more...

209
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:10,083
...we will be more troubled,
isn't it? - Yes. Understood.

210
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,499
It is possible that you are
thinking something else.

211
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,499
And I don't want you to
think something wrong.

212
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,499
You understand me, isn't it?

213
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,499
Yes. I think so. A bit.

214
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,333
Okay. You people can work here.

215
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,624
Didn't I tell you not
to touch the piano?

216
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:56,749
Then, what was the need
of playing the piano?

217
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,874
Don't lie. The piano
is open, isn't it?

218
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,624
Then who played this piano?

219
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,582
I am asking something of you.

220
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,790
Who played the piano? Answer me!

221
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,790
Madam, please forgive her,
She is a child.

222
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:16,375
Accepted that mistakes happen.
But look, she is lying.

223
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,665
Like that, Maria never lies.

224
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,582
If Maria doesn't lie,
is it me who is lying?

225
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,749
Even you... - Then who played
this piano? - Madam... me...

226
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,875
I don't want to listen to anything.

227
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:47,749
I know what the truth is.

228
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,875
No, Maria. This is not the
time to say anything.

229
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:57,458
When the right time comes, we
won't need to say anything.

230
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,957
Wipe these tears now.

231
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:06,416
If Mrs. Pinto sees you like this,
she won't even recognize you.

232
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,624
Come on, come on.

233
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,041
Come on. Smile.

234
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:16,999
Those people followed Jesus Christ.

235
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,540
And they thought that
whatever be the case...

236
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:23,957
...they will walk on
the road of truth.

237
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,917
But when they did tell the truth...
they were killed.

238
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:39,250
What is so funny?

239
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,540
If they knew that they will
die if they say the truth...

240
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:49,166
...then, what was the need
for them to tell the truth?

241
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,209
So you mean to say, that
they should have lied.

242
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,916
They would have saved their
life by lying, at least.

243
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:05,916
If you were in their place,
what would you do?

244
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:09,792
I would lie and save my life.
Just like... - Enough.

245
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,749
You people study your lessons.

246
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,665
I will... I will take your
test in some time.

247
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,707
Right now? - Yes, right
now. In an hour.

248
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:23,916
One hour is not enough
for one chapter, mummy.

249
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,916
One hour is enough.

250
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,874
And you two won't study
in the same room.

251
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,874
You will study in different rooms.

252
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,707
Different rooms? I feel so scared.

253
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,791
About what? - What if a ghost comes?

254
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:40,500
If a ghost comes, say ' Hi' to him.

255
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:48,749
Did you tell David some new story?

256
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,749
I didn't tell him any story.

257
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,749
You heard what I said.

258
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,083
Take your books and
go to the other room.

259
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:59,749
Okay.

260
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:05,041
Just like that in the other room?

261
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:13,417
Close all the curtains. Sarah
is going to the room.

262
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:51,124
Life is that is spent with you.'

263
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:55,084
Life is that is spent with you.

264
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,041
The night is that which
is spent in your dreams.

265
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:04,583
God shouldn't separate
us, o beloved.

266
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:10,166
God shouldn't separate
us, o beloved.

267
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:14,249
I should pray for this,
all the time.

268
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,583
You are my love, the peace
of my heart, my support.

269
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:30,832
God has brought you
on this earth for me.

270
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:37,250
I understand the emotion
of your ambition.

271
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,166
O beloved, I understand
your heart's thirst.

272
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,416
You say that there
isn't any like me.

273
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:55,457
You stay in my heart
with such strength.

274
00:21:55,458 --> 00:22:00,207
Therefore, I say this all
the time, all the time.

275
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,832
That life is that, spent with you.

276
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:09,708
The night is that, which
is spent in your dreams.

277
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,167
I am coming, son.

278
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,958
Are you all right? Why
were you crying?

279
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:31,958
Where was I crying? I
am studying. - You...

280
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:49,084
Sarah, child, I have come.
What is the matter?

281
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,124
Are you all right? Why
were you crying?

282
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:57,791
Me? No.

283
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,708
Sarah, crying isn't bad.
What is the matter?

284
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:07,042
Mama, didn't I tell you
that I wasn't crying?

285
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,749
Who was crying?

286
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,415
You mean I was dreaming.

287
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,290
That boy was crying.

288
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:20,250
Which boy?

289
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,749
Who is this Vicky now?

290
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,582
The one who had come here right now.

291
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,708
But I told him that
I want to study now.

292
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:40,125
But he started to cry.
I closed my ears.

293
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,416
And mummy, he was saying that...

294
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:50,207
...we would have to leave the house.

295
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:53,750
Then, didn't you ask him
why he was crying?

296
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,958
I did.

297
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:59,290
He said that they would live
in this house itself now.

298
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,332
But... he doesn't like this house.

299
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,500
And his papa plays the
piano very nicely.

300
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:10,500
So, he has a papa and
he plays the piano too?

301
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:18,583
Yes. But I told Vicky, nobody
will touch this piano.

302
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,165
I was right, wasn't it?

303
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,499
You spoke to his papa too?

304
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,165
No.

305
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,374
I have spoken only to Vicky.

306
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:35,082
His father is sitting with
the others in the hall.

307
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,165
I have come from the hall right
now. There is nobody in the hall.

308
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:41,082
Then, they must have gone upstairs.
To look at the house.

309
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,624
That's enough, Sarah. You had
spun enough stories now.

310
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,249
Stop lying.

311
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,875
I am not lying. Vicky had come
here, he had come here.

312
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,207
Where did he come from?

313
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:55,249
I have these keys. I opened
the door and I closed it.

314
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,500
Where did he come from
and where did he go?

315
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:37,375
No, Vicky!

316
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,291
What happened?

317
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:41,457
Mummy... Mummy...

318
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,957
Vicky had come here.

319
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,041
What is this? You are taking
his name all the time.

320
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,291
No, Mummy, he had come here.

321
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:53,041
Okay, look at your book.
Vicky threw it here. See.

322
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,249
How did that reach here?

323
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,082
See, mummy, Vicky
had come here. Yes.

324
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,582
There is no Vicky here. That book...

325
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:05,082
...it fell down from my hands.

326
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,749
How will your book just fall down?
Vicky has made is fall down.

327
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,249
Didn't I tell you that
it fell from my hands?

328
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,249
No, Vicky has made it fall down.

329
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,541
You go to your room.

330
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:18,375
Mummy... that...

331
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,541
I know it.

332
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:28,583
You aren't lying.

333
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,291
Yes, Sarah.

334
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:38,749
Whatever you said, was the truth.

335
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,374
But listen to this.

336
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:46,916
Whatever you hear and listen,
you will remain quiet.

337
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:07,332
Get up, David.
- What happened?

338
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,499
Look there.

339
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,249
Why did you move the curtains?

340
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,499
I didn't move any curtains.

341
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,082
Then, how did the curtains move?

342
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:19,249
Vicky! He is doing
this since so long.

343
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,332
He is moving the curtains
repeatedly.

344
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,750
Lies! You are lying. I will
call mummy right away.

345
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,082
That's enough. I am not lying.

346
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:33,541
You are a liar.

347
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:36,541
Vicky! Please come out
and show us your face.

348
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,082
I don't want to see it.

349
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:41,375
Why? What happened now?
What happened? David?

350
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:46,541
You are a coward! A coward!

351
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:50,708
Okay! I will close the curtains.

352
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:56,500
A real coward! He
cannot do anything.

353
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,666
Vicky. It is enough now.

354
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:18,249
See, David. He isn't
listening to me.

355
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,457
I won't listen. I won't
listen at all.

356
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:23,457
The two of you, get up from my bed.

357
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,915
This is our bed. We sleep here.

358
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:29,249
No. This is our bed.
I want to sleep here.

359
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,915
Why are you making such noises?
I am very much scared.

360
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:35,249
Shut up, David.

361
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,542
Don't irritate me. You
don't know my mother.

362
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,332
My mother will come and
kick you out of here.

363
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:47,917
And you don't know my parents too.

364
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,708
I will mama everything now.

365
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:55,041
Don't be mad, David. Didn't
you listen to that?

366
00:28:55,625 --> 00:29:00,959
That wasn't my voice.

367
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,374
Please come here and touch David.

368
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:11,291
Let him at least know that
you are in this room.

369
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:16,291
And that I am not lying.

370
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,249
What happened, son? What happened?

371
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,083
Sarah is scaring me! - I
am fed up of this girl.

372
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:29,291
I haven't done anything.

373
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,166
Today is the third day
of Sarah's punishment.

374
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:06,666
How many days more will
she be punished for?

375
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:09,166
She will be the one to decide that.

376
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:10,832
If she has committed a mistake...

377
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,374
...she should learn to
beg forgiveness too.

378
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,957
As it is, Sarah has grown up now.

379
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:19,332
She should read the bible too.

380
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,416
Father D'Souza will be
very happy to know...

381
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:25,332
...that Sarah is reading the bible.

382
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,999
That is if Father
D'Souza comes here.

383
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,375
He knows it very well that the
children cannot go out from here.

384
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:43,374
I cannot hear your voice.

385
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:48,166
I am reading, mama.

386
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:53,334
What is Maria doing up there?
I told her to do a small task.

387
00:30:53,459 --> 00:30:57,041
I didn't tell her to make
such a loud noise.

388
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:59,416
Please go and tell her not
to make such a noise.

389
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,416
Otherwise, my migraine attack
will start again and...

390
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:06,708
...I will not be able to tolerate it.

391
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:22,875
This Maria has gone crazy.

392
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:45,416
What is going on up there?

393
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:49,416
Did you listen to anything?
- No, I was reading.

394
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:52,499
Who is doing this noise? Sarah,
you heard that noise...

395
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,875
...isn't it? Tell me. Who
is there, upstairs?

396
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,916
No... no. Mummy. I don't know.

397
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:01,665
I know that you know everything.
Tell me.

398
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,458
See, Mama. I can't
tell you anything.

399
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:05,333
Why can't you tell me?

400
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:07,333
Because, whenever I tell you
anything, you scold me.

401
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:09,916
I had told you previously too.
There is someone in the room.

402
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:12,291
You had scolded me at that time too.

403
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:13,582
I won't tell you anything now.

404
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:17,917
Please tell me. Is there
anyone up there?

405
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:24,375
Yes. There is someone in that room.

406
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,749
Did you see anyone?

407
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,624
Yes. Didn't you see them, mama?
- Where are they?

408
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:58,249
Mama. They are everywhere. There,
that side, downstairs too.

409
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,665
I have made this sketch
yesterday, mama.

410
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,457
This is the boy Vicky,
this is his father...

411
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:06,249
...and this is his mother.
- And these...

412
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,874
What are all these numbers?

413
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,916
I have written these
numbers as many...

414
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:12,624
...times as I have seen these people.

415
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:19,083
And mostly, I have
seen this old lady.

416
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:22,874
You go and bring Mr. Edgar quickly.

417
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,665
Before it is dark...

418
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,041
All of us will have to
search them together.

419
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,916
Go! Please, quickly. - Yes. Yes.

420
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:31,582
Mama, I am feeling very scared.

421
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:35,500
No, son. No. Why are you scared?
Mama is with you, isn't it?

422
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:39,749
I am scared of this
old woman the most.

423
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,916
I think as if...

424
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:44,958
...she cannot see us. But she
keeps on seeing us, mama.

425
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:49,832
She is wandering around
us all the time.

426
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:54,250
She keeps on telling me, 'Come
here, child, come here.'

427
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:57,832
Don't lie, Sarah. -

428
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:02,707
I am telling you the truth.
Please believe me.

429
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:05,791
She wants to ask a lot of me.

430
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:11,875
Vicky was saying that she
is a magician. A magician.

431
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:18,791
We should move all the
curtains of this house.

432
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:21,208
So that there is no darkness. There
shouldn't be any darkness.

433
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:23,249
So that nobody can hide anywhere.
- Okay, madam.

434
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:28,000
Please, hurry up.

435
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,791
Do you know what this is?

436
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,916
This is a photo album. - Yes,
even I can see that.

437
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:46,958
But there are some strange
photos in it.

438
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:50,333
It seems as if everyone
is sleeping. See.

439
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:02,791
They aren't asleep. They are dead.

440
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:04,958
Please throw this inauspicious
album outside.

441
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:10,833
I don't need any thing like
this in this house.

442
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:28,167
It is very cold. Come here,
sit down. By the fire.

443
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,083
When you used to work
her previously...

444
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:44,416
...did you just look after
the children or... - No.

445
00:38:45,084 --> 00:38:48,792
I was a housekeeper. I used to
look after the whole house.

446
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,874
How many more servants were here?
- Only three.

447
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,749
That's it. Only three
were left in the end.

448
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,749
Only three? Why?

449
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,834
Our employer went to London.
He had a business there.

450
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:10,083
He went and settled there too.

451
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:12,374
He used to come sometimes
in the beginning.

452
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,041
Then, that stopped too.

453
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,749
Then, slowly, this house which...

454
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,834
...was full of people at one time,
started being empty.

455
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,916
And one day, it was totally empty.

456
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:27,791
It is such a strange thing.

457
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:33,334
Everyone leaves this place.

458
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:36,916
This is what happened with me too.

459
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:42,042
My relatives left me before
the war. That's it.

460
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:46,208
That was my last meeting
with my relatives.

461
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,791
Even we had left this
place and went away.

462
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:50,958
But, why did you go from this place?

463
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:53,833
Why had we gone?

464
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:58,291
Think that we had to leave.
The plague has set foot.

465
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:02,833
We were forced to leave.

466
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:07,833
Did Maria stop speaking then?

467
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:09,916
Maybe.

468
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:13,833
I don't remember it properly.

469
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:16,833
I think my memory has rusted.

470
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:21,125
She stopped speaking
all of a sudden.

471
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,916
But there should be some
reason, Mrs. Pinto.

472
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:27,041
People don't stop talking
just like that.

473
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:30,874
Some shock somewhere, some trauma?

474
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:34,792
It is too late, madam. I have
a lot of work in the morning.

475
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:41,417
I should sleep now. You sleep too.

476
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:18,999
Do you know, Frank? - What?

477
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,082
These noises that touch you and go...

478
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:24,916
...I am jealous of them too.
Because I think...

479
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:29,125
...that only I have a
right to touch you.

480
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,999
And when the children come?
The love will...

481
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,542
...be distributed when they
come too, isn't it?

482
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:40,916
After all, even they
have an equal right.

483
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:45,333
When they grow up, they will
embrace you. I think...

484
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:51,500
I think I will be jealous
of them too.

485
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:56,916
But if anyone comes in between us...

486
00:41:56,917 --> 00:42:03,000
...I won't be able to tolerate that.

487
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:08,916
When will papa come?

488
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:11,040
Papa will come as soon
as the war is over.

489
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:15,958
Why did he go to the war?

490
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:18,582
Because your papa is very brave.

491
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:21,957
And brave people are
needed during war.

492
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:26,249
Papa will be back in
a couple of days.

493
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:32,042
Come on. Close your eyes.

494
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,583
What happened, Madam?

495
00:45:38,584 --> 00:45:42,166
Give me the keys! - Yes. - Quickly!

496
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:47,625
But what happened?

497
00:45:56,167 --> 00:46:00,584
I had gone in that room.
A few minutes ago.

498
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:05,083
Take this tablet. You
will have some rest.

499
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:08,207
And I felt...

500
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:12,207
As if someone else was
in that room too.

501
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:17,790
But he was not a human being.

502
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:20,207
There is something in this house.

503
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:26,417
Such a thing, that is restless.
Which is wandering.

504
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:34,667
I know that you don't believe me.

505
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:39,249
Nobody will believe in my words.

506
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,499
I myself didn't believe
in such things.

507
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,625
I have full faith in what you say.

508
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:51,125
In fact, I believe in such
things from the beginning.

509
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:55,292
I know that it is very difficult
to believe in such things.

510
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,249
Even then, such things do exist.

511
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,249
I have heard many stories like this.

512
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,249
I have even heard...

513
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:08,249
...that the wall breaks
sometimes too.

514
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,791
Which has separated the
dead and the alive.

515
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,333
And when the walls breaks down...

516
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:19,292
...the dead come with
the living people.

517
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:26,833
No! No! This can't be true!
How can this be true?

518
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:29,416
The living and the dead!

519
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:32,249
The living and the dead
will meet on that day...

520
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,833
...which will be the last
day of this world.

521
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,249
It is written in the Bible too.

522
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,708
Sometimes, there is no answer
for something anywhere.

523
00:47:44,584 --> 00:47:46,707
There are many things like these...

524
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:50,875
...which don't have a answer
anywhere, ma'am.

525
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:26,792
Who is it?

526
00:48:45,334 --> 00:48:51,208
Who is it?

527
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:05,417
What are you doing here
so late in the night?

528
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:20,999
The Father had told me that...

529
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,582
I don't know what the
Father told you.

530
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:25,624
He will have to tell me
whatever he wishes to.

531
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:26,999
He will have to come here.

532
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,790
But what will we tell the Father?

533
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:30,916
That we searched all
through the house.

534
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:32,416
We didn't find anything anywhere.

535
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:36,999
It is very necessary
for him to come here.

536
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,459
Please wait. We shouldn't
be in such haste.

537
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:45,499
Yes? Yes, Madam.

538
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,416
Check this garden properly.

539
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:51,416
And tell me, where are the
graves in this garden.

540
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:54,540
Graves, madam? - Yes, graves.

541
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:56,582
When we had bought this house...

542
00:49:56,583 --> 00:50:00,042
...we were told that there
is a small cemetery here.

543
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:04,000
Maybe... there, behind the trees.

544
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:07,582
But madam, there is
no cemetery here.

545
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:09,749
There is a cemetery here, Mr. Edgar.

546
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,582
And it is very important
for me to know it.

547
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:15,334
Is one of these graves
of that boy Vicky?

548
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:21,834
Check it out. - Yes, madam.

549
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:29,875
She thinks that this house
is a haunted house.

550
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:31,916
Ghosts stay here.

551
00:50:31,917 --> 00:50:35,334
Don't you think that
it is dangerous...

552
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:40,375
...for her to go out like this?
- She can't go anywhere.

553
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:45,749
This fog won't let her go anywhere.

554
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,083
Yes. The fog.

555
00:50:49,792 --> 00:50:54,457
I had forgotten about his fog.

556
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:59,457
Okay, Mrs. Pinto,
tell me... tell me...

557
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:00,832
What should we do now?

558
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:04,499
Isn't it necessary to
unveil the truth now?

559
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,875
No, Eddie. Not now. Now she has to...

560
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:14,958
Eddie, that grave...

561
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:05,167
You have come? You have come?

562
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,958
The kids miss you a lot too.

563
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:34,624
They keep on asking me,
when will papa come back.

564
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:40,542
When will papa come back?

565
00:53:42,084 --> 00:53:46,209
You are all right, isn't it?
Why don't you speak?

566
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:51,167
Why don't you speak? Everything
will be all right.

567
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:55,291
You have come home now. I will
make everything all right.

568
00:53:55,667 --> 00:54:01,542
You have come home now.

569
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:34,250
It's you? Please come in.

570
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:41,415
Mrs. Pinto. This is
my husband. Frank.

571
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:45,291
It's good that you came. Your
appearance indicates...

572
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:49,666
...that you are weary
after a long journey.

573
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:52,959
Yes... I'm actually a journeyer.

574
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,457
Actually he's very weary.

575
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:59,625
Please arrange hot
water for his bath.

576
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:05,167
And then serve the food.

577
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:15,333
Frank, the kids are upstairs.

578
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:03,457
Someone has truly said this.

579
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:07,499
If you want to see
the wonder of God...

580
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:13,708
...then see them only in kids.

581
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:53,958
Daddy, what a surprise.

582
00:56:53,959 --> 00:56:56,791
David, get up. Look who's come!

583
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:59,958
Hey, daddy. Where were
you these many days?

584
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:03,541
Child, maybe...

585
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:07,833
...maybe I was going
through a journey.

586
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:11,124
I hope you kids are fine?

587
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:13,541
David, didn't I say
daddy would be back?

588
00:57:13,542 --> 00:57:16,582
Look, he's back.

589
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:18,624
You two are good kids.

590
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,707
I hope you didn't trouble
mummy too much?

591
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:22,999
No.

592
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,792
Good kids get a lot.

593
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:29,749
They get it from mummy and daddy.

594
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,791
From God too.

595
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:33,874
You were on a war, right?

596
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:39,459
How many enemy soldiers
did you kill?

597
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:51,708
Frank might be coming downstairs.

598
00:57:51,709 --> 00:57:58,167
Frank, the lunch is ready.
Are you coming downstairs?

599
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:08,166
Frank, the food has been laid.
Come downstairs.

600
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:33,500
Frank, how will you go on like
this without food and water?

601
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:39,000
If you are so bothered
about me lying down.

602
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:42,624
Then I'll sit.

603
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:44,708
Frank, you took me wrong.

604
00:58:44,709 --> 00:58:46,749
If you didn't want to come down...

605
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:51,082
...then I'd have sent
your food here.

606
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:55,082
No... I'm not hungry.

607
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:57,165
What's wrong with your hunger?

608
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:01,166
Maybe... maybe hunger doesn't
exist anymore for me.

609
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:03,749
Humans may cease to live one day.

610
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,749
But hunger is immortal.

611
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:12,666
Hunger vanishes if
food is taken in.

612
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:16,082
Those vanish which have a presence.

613
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:19,375
Non present ones don't vanish.

614
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:32,917
Mamma, papa was telling
that he saw dead people.

615
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:39,250
Mamma, where do those go,
who die in a war?

616
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:43,207
This is a ridiculous question?
- Mamma, why is that?

617
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:46,916
It's simple. A man's deeds
decides his future course.

618
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,124
A man's bad deeds and good deeds.

619
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:52,708
How do we distinguish between
good and bad deeds?

620
00:59:52,709 --> 00:59:54,249
Sara, that's enough.

621
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,833
Don't speak such things
while having food.

622
00:59:56,834 --> 00:59:58,874
Anyway, you are not asked
to fight in a war.

623
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:01,916
We are not going anyway. Are
we ever allowed to go out?

624
01:00:02,834 --> 01:00:04,874
Son, why do you want to go out?

625
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:08,625
You live in this house with
your mummy and daddy...

626
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,332
...who love you very much.

627
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:14,749
And what about those
who intrude in?

628
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,999
Who?

629
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,833
Those... outsiders.

630
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:22,165
There are no outsiders
in this house.

631
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:23,749
You had said once that...

632
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,165
...someone has intruded
in this house.

633
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:29,040
I had said that no one could
intrude in this house.

634
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:31,124
And I don't want a word about
this from you in future.

635
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:33,583
Did you get me?
- But you had said that someone...

636
01:00:33,584 --> 01:00:37,040
...is trying to intrude in our
house! - Sara, that's enough!

637
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,541
I want to say something.
- No.

638
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:45,040
Why?
- Because it is my order.

639
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:49,749
Sara, stop breathing this way.

640
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:53,333
Sara, please... stop
breathing this way.

641
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:57,749
Sara, I insist that you
stop this immediately!

642
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:01,749
Get up and go to your room.

643
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:07,209
And don't step out without
my permission.

644
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:16,791
Sara, relax...

645
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:20,040
My child, calm yourself.

646
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:21,791
Don't cry.

647
01:01:21,792 --> 01:01:26,041
Your tears will spoil your face.
- I don't care.

648
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:35,832
Sara, shall I tell you something?

649
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:39,207
Even I have seen them.

650
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:42,832
Yes. But don't keep
worrying about them.

651
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:46,082
Very soon, your mom
will see them too?

652
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:47,832
What makes you say so?

653
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,832
Soon, this house will
witness a great change.

654
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:56,291
Many things are destined to happen.

655
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,832
Your absence was a
like a nightmare...

656
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:12,291
...for this house and me.

657
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:17,124
The kids are very happy too.

658
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,874
Kids who go through happiness
in their childhood...

659
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:23,124
...become good persons of the future.

660
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:26,291
This is good news.

661
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:29,750
But the kid's daddy doesn't
seem to be happy.

662
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:35,250
Anything wrong?

663
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:41,874
Well that's what is confusing.

664
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:46,999
I'm not getting what's wrong.

665
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,083
Frank, you seem to
be annoyed with me.

666
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:54,459
I'd like to apologize if
I hurt in you in someone.

667
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,374
Sandra, there are many things...

668
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:08,499
...stuck between right and wrong.

669
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:13,291
What's that?

670
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:22,500
Accident. Mishap... is neither
right nor wrong.

671
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:28,915
It's just a case of bad luck...

672
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:33,915
...which we call as misfortune.

673
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:39,041
Did you ever come across
any accident?

674
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:44,167
Maybe it happened... Maybe
it's still going on.

675
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,624
What ridiculous things
are you talking?

676
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,833
Frank, this is your house.
I'm your wife.

677
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:55,374
David and Sara are your kids.

678
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:58,458
The crystal clear truth is right
in front of you and you...

679
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:02,374
lf...

680
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:05,374
...if this is the truth...

681
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:10,875
...and is crystal clear as you say...

682
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:15,374
...then why isn't visible to me.

683
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:18,833
What? What did you say?

684
01:04:22,042 --> 01:04:26,875
I've many things to say... yet
I don't have words to speak.

685
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,416
Now she's reacting as if
nothing has happened?

686
01:04:51,417 --> 01:04:55,208
And what about her daughter?
- She's not that stubborn.

687
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:58,082
But making the children understand...

688
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:00,124
...is not as tough as making
their mom understand.

689
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:03,041
She can be a barrier
for our intentions.

690
01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:06,916
I myself have made this
dress for sweet daughter.

691
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:11,541
And mamma.
- Yes.

692
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:17,083
Mamma, I'm looking ravishing
like a bride, don't I?

693
01:05:18,292 --> 01:05:21,041
Now, take this off.

694
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,082
No mamma. Not so soon.

695
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:25,166
Let this be on me
for some more time.

696
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:27,541
Sara, I've made this for
your first communion.

697
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:29,624
It'll get spoilt.

698
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:33,333
I promise it won't get spoilt.

699
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:37,333
Mamma, please let me wear
this for some more time.

700
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:40,041
One condition. You won't
sit on the ground.

701
01:05:40,042 --> 01:05:45,500
You won't spoil it.

702
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:34,416
I warned you not to
sit on the ground.

703
01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:38,124
Mamma, the clothes are not
spoilt. They are fine.

704
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:44,500
Why do you always do the
opposite of what is said?

705
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:14,582
Where is Sara?

706
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:17,166
Where is Sara?

707
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:21,042
You are mad! I'm Sara.

708
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:26,416
I'm your daughter.

709
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:29,499
You are not my daughter.
Where is Sara?

710
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,249
Better tell me, where is Sara?

711
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:37,042
Tell me, where is Sara?
Where is my Sara?

712
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:40,541
What did you do to my Sara?
You are not Sara.

713
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:46,709
Where is Sara?

714
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:07,457
Sara, what happened?

715
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,540
She wants to kill me.

716
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:12,208
She will not rest
until she kills me.

717
01:08:12,209 --> 01:08:14,249
You are insane. Get this.

718
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,749
You are insane! You are evil.

719
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,874
Baby, get inside.
- She wants to kill me!

720
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:24,333
Calm down.
- You are insane!

721
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:42,208
Mrs. Pinto, is Sara all right?

722
01:08:42,209 --> 01:08:46,125
She was not calming down. So
I left her with her papa.

723
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:51,458
Actually... she wanted to have
a talk with her father. - Ok.

724
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:56,458
I'm sorry, ma'am. But
what took place inside?

725
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,415
Ma'am, I want to say something.

726
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:09,249
You seriously need some rest.

727
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:12,334
The responsibility of this house
is pushing you too much.

728
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:16,249
So, entrust me the responsibility.

729
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:19,666
I know what is to be done
in this house and when.

730
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:24,249
What do you mean? Please specify.

731
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:27,540
You say you know what to do
in this house and when?

732
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:30,708
No... actually... I was just
giving you a suggestion.

733
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,874
I don't need your suggestion.

734
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:36,291
And this... what were you giving me?

735
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:38,374
The medicine that
you take regularly.

736
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:41,540
The tablets for migraine.

737
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:47,709
You may please leave.
Let me be alone.

738
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:33,332
I was calling out for you.

739
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:38,791
I think that you didn't hear me.

740
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:43,374
Yes, I heard it.

741
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:47,917
But, it sounded like a
distant voice to me.

742
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:52,791
Frank, you are always
lost in some world.

743
01:10:52,792 --> 01:10:56,791
What makes you think so much?

744
01:10:56,792 --> 01:11:01,750
I wonder if we are losing
our intimacy!

745
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:12,125
I'm helpless and maybe...

746
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:17,666
...and maybe we are losing
our intimacy. - What?

747
01:11:17,667 --> 01:11:22,291
What did you say?
- No... Sara said something to me.

748
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:25,625
I didn't get her.
- Sara is just a kid.

749
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:28,832
But she sure does to play
with words nowadays.

750
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:33,625
But, I remember the words that
you said to me long back.

751
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:38,792
Frank, I'm a no one without you.

752
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:45,333
And I love the kids equally
well as you do.

753
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:04,707
Sara, what happened?

754
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:08,167
She hit me. She has gone crazy!

755
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:14,875
Just like the other day.
I hope you remember?

756
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:20,875
No! I don't remember anything!

757
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,541
Are you going somewhere?
- Yes.

758
01:12:38,542 --> 01:12:41,707
But, why? And where are you going?

759
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:45,083
When? Why? Where and How?

760
01:12:45,084 --> 01:12:48,375
These words are buried deep
in the grave of confusion.

761
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,916
Frank, what kind of confusion?

762
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:57,749
This is your house. We
all are your dear ones.

763
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,833
Yes. All though this is true...

764
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:03,542
...it doesn't differentiate
me from what am I?

765
01:13:04,917 --> 01:13:07,499
Frank, is our relationship so weak...

766
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,875
...that we can't share
each other's feelings?

767
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:17,541
Sandra, strength doesn't
lie in a relationship.

768
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:20,916
It lies in the foundation
of a relationship.

769
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:23,958
Frank, what foundation
are you talking?

770
01:13:23,959 --> 01:13:29,750
Love itself is the foundation of
every relationship, isn't it?

771
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:33,541
Foundation can be an illusion...
sometimes.

772
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,958
This is not an illusion.
This is the truth.

773
01:13:35,959 --> 01:13:38,958
I'm your wife standing before you.

774
01:13:38,959 --> 01:13:42,417
Sara and David are not my kids.
- They are not my kids.

775
01:13:43,959 --> 01:13:47,541
The darkness...

776
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:49,874
Frank, they can do nothing
but live in the darkness.

777
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:51,916
They'll turn blind if
they face the light.

778
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:57,375
Why don't you understand this?

779
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,458
I too... am stuck somewhere between
darkness and light...

780
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:09,541
...trying to find a way out.

781
01:14:09,542 --> 01:14:12,541
Frank, your journey has ended.

782
01:14:12,542 --> 01:14:15,541
You don't have to find a way out.

783
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:17,624
You are not stuck anywhere.

784
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:19,708
You are right on your destination.

785
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:23,040
No, Sandra, this can't
be my destination.

786
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:27,458
I might not be stuck. This
might be halt for me.

787
01:14:27,583 --> 01:14:31,582
But this is certainly
not my destination.

788
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:35,708
Frank, why are you
speaking this way?

789
01:14:35,709 --> 01:14:38,207
Because I don't quite get...

790
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:40,874
...whether this is a
dream or a reality.

791
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:44,582
You are not asleep.
You are wide-awake.

792
01:14:44,583 --> 01:14:48,582
Humans day dream too.

793
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:54,042
I want liberation from these dreams.

794
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:58,666
Sandra, you can be the moon.

795
01:15:58,667 --> 01:16:04,125
But, I can't quite
be the sky for you.

796
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:11,708
Mate, don't talk such crazy things.

797
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:15,083
You come after ten days and
talk such flimsy things.

798
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:19,584
This is ground reality. Don't
ever expect illusions here.

799
01:16:20,958 --> 01:16:24,708
Veeru, this is not about any
illusion. This is the truth.

800
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:26,749
The truth that I faced myself.

801
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:32,416
I've seen it. I have felt
it and experienced it.

802
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:35,207
You are saying that
there's a woman...

803
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:37,249
...who calls you her husband.
There are kids...

804
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:41,124
...who call you their daddy. But
you have never been married.

805
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:44,165
Veeru, I know that I have
never been married.

806
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:47,958
But that house. That woman. Those
kids.

807
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,625
It feels like they are my dear ones.

808
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:55,708
And you accepted it.

809
01:16:55,709 --> 01:16:57,791
Frank, I'm scared of
the consequences...

810
01:16:57,792 --> 01:17:01,708
...if you accept this as the truth.

811
01:17:01,709 --> 01:17:04,165
Veeru, I have not yet accepted it.

812
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:06,332
But I couldn't deny it either.

813
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:08,416
I couldn't tell them that
I'm not the one...

814
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:11,708
...that they assume me to be.

815
01:17:11,709 --> 01:17:16,000
What was that power, which
made you deny the truth?

816
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:21,500
A certain power which is
beyond my understanding...

817
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:25,207
...but is in me.

818
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:28,333
I'm confused. Should I take
you to a psychiatrist...

819
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,749
...or the chairman of the company...

820
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:35,000
...who has is raised a uproar
since you went missing!

821
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:37,416
Why? What problem does he have?

822
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:39,499
Frank, you know that
the reputation...

823
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,749
...of the company depends on you.

824
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:45,000
The company lost 2 big contracts
in your absence.

825
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:48,791
What else would you expect
the chairman to do?

826
01:17:48,792 --> 01:17:51,791
But Veeru... I had never met him.

827
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,040
He never meets anyone.

828
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:56,124
He's a retired Brigadier
of the army.

829
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:58,207
He's comes out only when required.

830
01:17:58,208 --> 01:18:01,207
There can't be any other
emergency for him.

831
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:03,291
Veeru, please handle this problem.

832
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:05,374
Please manage.

833
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:09,208
I'll manage. But you
must meet him once.

834
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:12,457
Veeru, I want to spend
some time with myself.

835
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:16,832
I want to understand myself.

836
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:20,709
I've three new characters
in my life's play.

837
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,082
They are not my present.

838
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:29,166
Are they my past?

839
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:34,583
Or are they my future?

840
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:41,375
We'll solve this matter at any cost.

841
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:54,375
Come my kids.

842
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:57,541
Don't be scared. Mamma's here.

843
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:03,042
Mamma's with you. Don't be scared.

844
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:18,375
There are no curtains here either.

845
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:25,541
Come. Sit here.

846
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:31,000
Where are the damn curtains?

847
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:40,041
Are you kids all right?

848
01:20:40,042 --> 01:20:43,500
Show me.
- I want my papa.

849
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:46,957
My child, papa has gone.

850
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:49,957
Come here.

851
01:20:49,958 --> 01:20:53,458
You are lying. I want my papa.

852
01:20:53,459 --> 01:20:57,000
I'm speaking the truth. No idea
where you papa has gone.

853
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,249
Frank, it's you?

854
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:15,875
You are here? You... you...

855
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,875
I'm sorry, sir. But I've
never met you before.

856
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,999
What's impossible, sir?

857
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,041
This is Frank. Our
company's engineer.

858
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:29,166
But Mr. Veerandra. This
is not possible.

859
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,999
Sir, what is not possible?

860
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,499
If he's Frank, then he
can't be an engineer...

861
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,542
...and if he's an engineer
then he can't be Frank.

862
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:41,082
Sir, why are you saying
this? I'm Frank.

863
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:43,458
The engineer of your company.

864
01:21:43,459 --> 01:21:46,875
Sir, he's Frank. And he's the
engineer of this company.

865
01:21:47,292 --> 01:21:53,041
And our company has its reputation
because of him.

866
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:56,041
Frank was an army officer.

867
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:58,458
He was my cousin.

868
01:21:58,459 --> 01:22:02,458
He breathed his last in my arms.

869
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:07,417
But your appearance...
your face... your height

870
01:22:08,459 --> 01:22:13,041
Even his name was Frank.

871
01:22:13,042 --> 01:22:15,124
His name is Frank too.

872
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,207
Which Frank are you talking about?

873
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:21,499
Which time are you talking?

874
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,459
If he's Frank, then this
can't be his age.

875
01:22:35,334 --> 01:22:39,125
This is a miracle! A miracle.

876
01:22:43,334 --> 01:22:46,082
Where are the curtains
of this house?

877
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:48,333
Where are the curtains
of this house?

878
01:22:48,334 --> 01:22:51,082
Tell me, where are the curtains?

879
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:54,082
Who took it away?

880
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:56,166
Tell me, who took away
all the curtains?

881
01:22:56,167 --> 01:23:00,000
Tell me, who was it?
Who is in this house?

882
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:02,582
Listen. You know everything.

883
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:04,665
I know that you know everything.

884
01:23:04,666 --> 01:23:06,707
The same incidents happened
with you, right?

885
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:08,582
Tell me. Please tell me.

886
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:11,582
You know everything. Please tell me.

887
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:13,665
Please tell me, who
is in this house?

888
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:17,000
Please tell me, who
is in this house?

889
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:19,208
Please... tell me. Tell me.

890
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:21,624
You can't talk, right? No problem.

891
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:23,707
Wait a minute. You can write
it down, can't you?

892
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:27,042
Write it down. Write it.

893
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:29,624
Write it down!
- What's going on?

894
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:32,374
Write it down!
- Ma'am let go of her.

895
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:36,124
This won't be of any help.

896
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:38,208
Why?
- Because besides being dumb...

897
01:23:38,209 --> 01:23:41,124
...she's illiterate too.
She can't read or write.

898
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:44,124
Then, where are the curtains
of this house?

899
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:46,208
Where did they go?
Who took them away?

900
01:23:46,209 --> 01:23:48,249
This is the question of
my children's life.

901
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:51,124
Why don't you try to understand?
Who took away all the curtains?

902
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:53,499
I know that someone has
taken away the curtains.

903
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,416
But there's no use getting
excited like this.

904
01:23:56,417 --> 01:23:58,832
Eddi, It's good that you came.
I was about to call you.

905
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,665
Did you come to know about
anything? - About what, Mrs. Pinto?

906
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:06,166
Edgar, someone took away all
the curtains of this house.

907
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:08,208
It's strange!

908
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:12,166
Why would anyone take
away the curtains?

909
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:14,416
Why would anyone take it?

910
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:17,416
Ma'am, what do you think
is the reason?

911
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:20,416
I think there's a reason.

912
01:24:20,417 --> 01:24:25,542
What's that reason?

913
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:29,208
Maybe someone wants...

914
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:33,083
...the rays of the sunshine
to come in this house.

915
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:37,083
This means that someone wants
to kill my children.

916
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:39,957
Ma'am, I think that your
suspicion is wrong.

917
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:43,084
How can the sunlight kill anyone?

918
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:46,249
You are mad.

919
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:50,416
I had told you that my kids
are photosensitive.

920
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:52,791
This sunlight will kill them.

921
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:54,874
But you had said this long back.

922
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:58,208
A lot of time has passed
between this gap.

923
01:24:58,209 --> 01:25:00,624
Maybe the kids are all right now.

924
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:04,792
How will you know if you
hide them in darkness?

925
01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:08,499
Ma'am, these afflictions
are strange!

926
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:13,125
My sister-in-law had pain in
the back and in her legs.

927
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:20,292
Then one day suddenly
the ailment vanished.

928
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,707
Give the keys.

929
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:51,249
Sir won't like this.

930
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:54,540
I know what you three want from me.

931
01:25:54,541 --> 01:25:57,582
You want to frighten
my kids and me...

932
01:25:57,583 --> 01:25:59,665
...and drive us away from this house.

933
01:25:59,666 --> 01:26:01,582
I know everything.

934
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:06,500
You wanted this since when
you came in this house.

935
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:10,707
But I won't allow this to happen.

936
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:13,540
Give the keys.

937
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:17,167
You are getting worried for no
reason at all. Just think...

938
01:26:17,292 --> 01:26:19,374
I insist. Give me the keys.

939
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:24,833
I won't speak the next time.

940
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:49,374
This is the limit!

941
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:51,582
She's not willing to
hear even a word.

942
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:55,541
Now, I had enough. We
must do something.

943
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:57,749
What do you say, Eddie?

944
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:01,875
Yes, we had enough now.
Indeed this is the limit!

945
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:06,332
Her stubbornness is out of limit.

946
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:09,624
I think we should complete
our work now.

947
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:14,708
Which work? - Clear the dry
leaves from the grave.

948
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:20,709
Let's go.

949
01:27:36,792 --> 01:27:38,958
Look at this picture carefully.

950
01:27:38,959 --> 01:27:43,750
Look.

951
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,666
There's no need. This is I.

952
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:56,792
Veeru, look. This is Sandra.
This is Sara. This is David.

953
01:27:57,833 --> 01:28:01,291
I was living with them
in their house.

954
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:10,374
I was living with them since
the past few days.

955
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:14,291
I must believe you now, after
seeing these pictures.

956
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,832
Frank, tell me one thing.

957
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:21,541
How were you feeling while
living with them?

958
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:23,582
Sir, one thing was clear that...

959
01:28:23,583 --> 01:28:25,707
...I'm not the one they
are assuming me to be.

960
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:28,707
I wanted to tell them the truth.

961
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:33,707
But I just couldn't
say anything to them.

962
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:40,167
This mystery can be explained
only on one point.

963
01:28:40,416 --> 01:28:42,707
This is a case of reincarnation.

964
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:45,707
Rebirth is a reality.

965
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:48,415
But sir...
- You must believe it.

966
01:28:48,416 --> 01:28:50,541
These pictures... your identity...

967
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:52,916
...you meeting with these
three persons...

968
01:28:52,917 --> 01:28:58,875
...proves that there is rebirth.

969
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:03,457
His name was Frank John Williams.

970
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:07,375
And I believe that you were
born on 27th July 1962...

971
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:13,208
...in the noon at about
3:30 p. M right?

972
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,958
I can't understand whether
I'm on the earth...

973
01:29:19,959 --> 01:29:24,916
...or any other distant planet!

974
01:29:24,917 --> 01:29:29,916
But I can interpret everything now.

975
01:29:29,917 --> 01:29:34,499
My name is Frank James Williams.

976
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:40,708
But my face and my soul
belong to Frank John.

977
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:45,708
If this is the truth then there
is one unanswered question.

978
01:29:45,834 --> 01:29:48,875
Why would nature... God
want this to happen?

979
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:55,708
Sir, I get everything now.
I must return back.

980
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:01,541
Sara, what's mamma doing?
- She has gone insane.

981
01:30:01,542 --> 01:30:04,541
Liar! - I have told that
she has gone insane.

982
01:30:04,542 --> 01:30:08,416
You are lying!
- All right then. Sit here alone.

983
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:11,750
Why would I be alone?
- Because I'm going? - Where?

984
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:15,791
To the forest. - Why are you
going so late at night?

985
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:18,874
To look for papa. I won't
stay in this house anymore.

986
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:22,083
You are running from this house?
- Yes.

987
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,707
You'll go jumping out of the window?

988
01:30:24,708 --> 01:30:27,541
Yes, I'll run away after jumping
through this window.

989
01:30:27,542 --> 01:30:29,624
David, what do you want now?

990
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:33,833
Even I want to meet papa.
I'm coming too.

991
01:30:33,834 --> 01:30:38,917
Come.

992
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:06,582
David, be careful.

993
01:31:06,583 --> 01:31:12,042
Be quiet. Come.

994
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:23,000
Don't speak anything.

995
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:33,000
Be fast.

996
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:39,624
Sara, what is there?

997
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:44,624
I suppose these are graves.

998
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:49,874
Stay here.

999
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:52,874
Sara, don't go there.
- Why?

1000
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:56,624
What if a ghost springs up?

1001
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:59,040
Ghosts don't exist in graves.

1002
01:31:59,041 --> 01:32:02,624
You find only skeletons in it.

1003
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:08,042
Stay here.

1004
01:32:18,917 --> 01:32:22,041
David, there's something
written here.

1005
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:32,375
Sara, let's go from here.
- Wait.

1006
01:32:56,709 --> 01:32:58,749
David, come here.

1007
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:01,957
Don't tell mamma that we are here.

1008
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:04,957
David, don't talk to them.
- Why?

1009
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:08,584
Because David... they are dead.

1010
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:10,124
What?!

1011
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:13,207
Sara, it can't be.
- Yes David. They are ghosts.

1012
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:15,708
Come here quickly. Let's
get out of this place.

1013
01:33:15,709 --> 01:33:17,749
Why aren't they in white attire
if they are ghosts?

1014
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,833
You had said that ghosts
have fiery red eyes...

1015
01:33:19,834 --> 01:33:21,915
...and they shine in the darkness.

1016
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:25,584
David, forget what
I said. Come here.

1017
01:33:25,709 --> 01:33:28,040
You always pester me
and keep lying to me.

1018
01:33:28,041 --> 01:33:32,999
I don't want to heed your words.

1019
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,292
Neither am I pestering you
nor am I lying to you.

1020
01:33:36,709 --> 01:33:39,207
Go away from there.
Give me your hand.

1021
01:33:39,208 --> 01:33:44,458
Run!

1022
01:33:55,208 --> 01:33:58,749
David, run!

1023
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:01,749
Children, they are ghosts!
They are ghosts!

1024
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:04,749
Mamma... they...

1025
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:10,500
Go inside. Run!

1026
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:19,040
Ma'am, there's no use firing at us.

1027
01:34:19,041 --> 01:34:23,749
Plague has already killed us.

1028
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:27,207
Don't move forward.

1029
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:32,667
Don't move forward.

1030
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:59,040
Children, come to me.

1031
01:34:59,041 --> 01:35:02,082
Mamma, are you all right?

1032
01:35:02,083 --> 01:35:03,915
Go away from here.

1033
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:05,999
Ma'am, open the door!

1034
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,041
Why should I open it?
What do you all want?

1035
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:11,207
Mamma, don't open the door.

1036
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:13,291
Yes, mamma. Don't open the door.

1037
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:16,375
Mamma, we've seen their graves.
- Yes, mamma.

1038
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:20,542
Both of you, rush upstairs
and hide somewhere.

1039
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:22,874
Mamma, I'm getting scared.

1040
01:35:22,875 --> 01:35:24,957
Don't worry, kids. Go upstairs.

1041
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:27,040
And listen. Come what may.

1042
01:35:27,041 --> 01:35:31,124
Don't get separated from each other.

1043
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:36,209
Go. Go upstairs.

1044
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:50,874
Ma'am, we are trying to explain
this to you since long.

1045
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:54,291
What... what are you
trying to explain?

1046
01:35:54,292 --> 01:35:57,124
About this house.

1047
01:35:57,125 --> 01:36:00,874
The changed circumstances
of this house.

1048
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:04,124
Which circumstances? What
do you want to say?

1049
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:08,124
We must learn to stay with
each other together.

1050
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:10,541
We must learn as to how the living...

1051
01:36:10,542 --> 01:36:13,999
...and the dead stay together.

1052
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,791
How is this possible?
You all are dead.

1053
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:20,874
Go away from here. Go away.

1054
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:23,207
Let my kids and me
to live our lives.

1055
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:24,874
Go from here!

1056
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:28,332
Well, we may go from here.

1057
01:36:28,333 --> 01:36:31,791
But what about the others?
They won't leave you.

1058
01:36:32,875 --> 01:36:36,292
Who are the others?
- The outsiders.

1059
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,957
There are no outsiders in here.

1060
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:41,041
Ma'am, there are outsiders.

1061
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:43,915
They were the ones who
took away the curtains.

1062
01:36:43,916 --> 01:36:46,915
No! There are no outsiders here.

1063
01:36:46,916 --> 01:36:49,915
Ma'am, I assure you that
they are present...

1064
01:36:49,916 --> 01:36:53,500
...in the house right now.
Inside this house.

1065
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:58,041
And they are searching for you.

1066
01:36:58,042 --> 01:37:01,207
No! This can't happen!

1067
01:37:01,208 --> 01:37:04,333
This can't happen!
- Ma'am, this is what is going on.

1068
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:08,334
And very soon they'll have
you under their control.

1069
01:37:08,417 --> 01:37:14,834
This can't happen!

1070
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:22,957
I can hear something!

1071
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:28,375
Be quiet!

1072
01:37:35,958 --> 01:37:39,207
Where are you all?

1073
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:41,957
They have found the children.

1074
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:45,041
Now we can't do anything.

1075
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:47,499
Now, you must go upstairs
and talk to them.

1076
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:53,249
Be fast. Don't waste time.

1077
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:55,333
Be fast.
- No!

1078
01:37:55,334 --> 01:37:57,999
I won't allow this to happen.

1079
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,458
No! This can't happen!

1080
01:38:33,042 --> 01:38:36,917
The kids are in this house.
I'm going to talk with them.

1081
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,082
But we can't see anyone here.

1082
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:42,917
You can't see them nor
can you hear them.

1083
01:38:44,292 --> 01:38:47,291
Kids, why are you sacred?

1084
01:38:47,292 --> 01:38:50,458
What makes you so scared?

1085
01:38:50,459 --> 01:38:54,583
Talk to me. Tell me,
what's the matter?

1086
01:38:57,334 --> 01:39:00,958
Kids, talk to me. What's the matter?

1087
01:39:01,042 --> 01:39:04,333
Tell me. What's the matter?

1088
01:39:04,334 --> 01:39:10,458
Don't tell anything to her.
Don't say anything.

1089
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:24,459
Don't tell anything.
Don't say anything.

1090
01:39:25,334 --> 01:39:28,958
No, David. They'll allow
us to live peacefully...

1091
01:39:29,083 --> 01:39:35,000
...if I tell them the truth.

1092
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:38,166
Kids, why are you crying?

1093
01:39:38,167 --> 01:39:40,208
What had happened in this room?

1094
01:39:40,209 --> 01:39:45,709
What had happened with you?

1095
01:40:01,875 --> 01:40:06,374
We were suffocated to
death with a pillow.

1096
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:09,708
So, your mother killed you both.

1097
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:14,540
She used a pillow to kill you?

1098
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:17,124
No! No!

1099
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:20,374
She didn't kill us. No!

1100
01:40:20,375 --> 01:40:22,458
Kids, if you are dead...

1101
01:40:22,459 --> 01:40:25,374
...then what are you
doing in this house?

1102
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:30,124
We are not dead!

1103
01:40:30,125 --> 01:40:35,583
We are not dead!

1104
01:40:44,417 --> 01:40:49,875
We are not dead!

1105
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:54,042
We are not dead!

1106
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:34,208
Are you all right?

1107
01:41:34,209 --> 01:41:38,750
Yes. Just feeling a little giddy.

1108
01:41:40,209 --> 01:41:45,208
What had happened? - They had come.

1109
01:41:45,209 --> 01:41:48,499
All three of them?
- Yes. All three of them.

1110
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:54,292
The mother and both her kids.

1111
01:41:54,334 --> 01:41:58,125
It's quite strange...
and interesting too!

1112
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:01,792
Interesting! You find these things
strange and interesting!

1113
01:42:01,875 --> 01:42:05,208
And here I am on the edge!

1114
01:42:05,209 --> 01:42:07,874
We don't even about them properly.

1115
01:42:07,875 --> 01:42:09,957
What more do you want
to know about them?

1116
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:13,625
Isn't this enough that the
woman had become insane!

1117
01:42:14,209 --> 01:42:19,167
She suffocated the kids to death
and then shot herself.

1118
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:25,167
If not worried about me, be at
least worried about your kid.

1119
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:28,500
But, what happened to him? Vicky's
quite hale and hearty.

1120
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:31,540
You think so!

1121
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:34,540
He gets up screaming in
the middle of the night.

1122
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:38,500
Nightmares upset his sleep
and you say he's fine.

1123
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:41,582
All right.

1124
01:42:41,583 --> 01:42:47,667
We'll leave this place
in the morning. Fine?

1125
01:42:48,292 --> 01:42:53,291
Sorry, my child.

1126
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:58,291
I love you too, my child.

1127
01:42:58,292 --> 01:43:04,041
I loved you two very much.

1128
01:43:07,292 --> 01:43:10,708
Your father and you both
were everything to me.

1129
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:22,541
I kept comforting you that
your father would be back.

1130
01:43:26,583 --> 01:43:31,667
We kept waiting.

1131
01:43:32,583 --> 01:43:36,582
But one day...

1132
01:43:36,583 --> 01:43:42,208
...the doorbell rang.

1133
01:43:49,333 --> 01:43:52,624
Frank didn't come. The news
of his death arrived instead.

1134
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:55,332
My life... my affection...
my love... my hopes...

1135
01:43:55,333 --> 01:43:58,374
...and my desires turned
in to graveyard.

1136
01:43:58,375 --> 01:44:02,250
That experience was enough
for that decision.

1137
01:44:30,833 --> 01:44:34,250
Vicky, come with me. There
is nothing here.

1138
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:36,457
C'mon, my child. Come.

1139
01:44:36,458 --> 01:44:41,292
Good!

1140
01:45:05,708 --> 01:45:11,125
Sandra, where are you?

1141
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:17,874
Frank, I'm here.

1142
01:45:17,875 --> 01:45:23,333
Sandra, I have come back.
I'm your Frank.

1143
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:26,749
I won't go anywhere.

1144
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:29,874
Sandra, we'll all stay together.

1145
01:45:29,875 --> 01:45:33,415
No, Frank. This is not possible.

1146
01:45:33,416 --> 01:45:35,541
But why, Sandra?

1147
01:45:35,542 --> 01:45:39,541
Frank, it's true that
this life is a journey.

1148
01:45:39,542 --> 01:45:47,000
But time is not a land from
where you can return back.

1149
01:45:49,458 --> 01:45:51,541
Frank, you have reached
far too ahead...

1150
01:45:51,542 --> 01:45:57,500
...where I can't reach you and
I have been left far behind...

1151
01:45:58,458 --> 01:46:02,874
...where you can't return back.

1152
01:46:02,875 --> 01:46:05,457
I'll pray for your long life.

1153
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:08,083
Sandra, please don't go leaving me.

1154
01:46:08,084 --> 01:46:10,916
I don't want to live
this crazy life!

1155
01:46:10,917 --> 01:46:14,875
Sandra, If only death can unite
us, then I'm ready to die.

1156
01:46:15,917 --> 01:46:19,708
No, Frank. Death departs
the soul from the body.

1157
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:24,083
It doesn't unite two souls.

1158
01:46:24,084 --> 01:46:27,708
Frank, hold me in
your arms for once.

1159
01:46:57,125 --> 01:46:59,958
Frank, take care of yourself.

1160
01:46:59,959 --> 01:47:03,917
And always keep this with you.

1161
01:47:04,959 --> 01:47:10,417
This will protect you.

1162
01:47:13,125 --> 01:47:17,165
I can't say that I'll wait for you.

1163
01:47:17,166 --> 01:47:21,083
But I'll certainly
wait for that time.

1164
01:47:22,834 --> 01:47:28,292
Frank, I'm leaving from here.

1165
01:48:47,625 --> 01:48:51,542
The place where you are standing
is not a destination.

1166
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:55,041
This is the extremity.
That is the end.

1167
01:48:55,125 --> 01:48:56,916
Whose end?

1168
01:48:56,917 --> 01:49:03,041
The past 10 days which you
can remember as a dream.

1169
01:49:03,667 --> 01:49:06,249
But you can't live with those.

1170
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:13,208
No, Veeru. It is said that the
end brings a new beginning.

1171
01:49:14,667 --> 01:49:17,082
Maybe my beginning is
somewhere nearby.

1172
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:20,666
Frank, there is nothing nearby.

1173
01:49:20,667 --> 01:49:23,165
You'll find here only
drifting spirits...

1174
01:49:23,166 --> 01:49:26,916
...which you have accepted
as your life.

1175
01:49:26,917 --> 01:49:29,791
But mate, this is not life.

1176
01:49:29,792 --> 01:49:33,709
There was life here... sometime ago.

1177
01:49:35,958 --> 01:49:39,791
Frank, it was not life.

1178
01:49:39,792 --> 01:49:42,708
It was just some memories
of the truth...

1179
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:47,083
...which had faded long ago
in the history of time.

1180
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:54,584
Frank, I can understand
your anguish.

1181
01:49:55,958 --> 01:49:59,916
Come with me. The
life is over there.

1182
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:05,084
Come.
