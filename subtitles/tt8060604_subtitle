1
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,160
"God is the greatest.."

2
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,640
"God is the greatest.."

3
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,880
Mister, I need to go
to VT station.

4
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240
Please sit.
- Thank you!

5
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,360
What's the matter?
Why's there only one taxi

6
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,680
at the taxi stand today?

7
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,040
Greetings!
I welcome you all

8
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,600
to today's episode.
Our debate for today

9
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,200
is on the topic
of Islam and terrorism.

10
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,480
I thought that peace

11
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,360
would prevail on earth.

12
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,720
But if we observe the numbers
then we can see

13
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,120
that the number of people
who have died in the world wars

14
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
will be less than the number
people who have died

15
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,440
due to terrorist activities.

16
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,480
The track record makes it clear
that the people belonging

17
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,480
to Islamic background
have been connected..

18
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,480
If we raise our concern
towards protecting our nation

19
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,200
then we should think about the
number of deaths in Pakistan.

20
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,080
Every day Muslims murders
other Muslims.

21
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,320
Are they doing that
to protect their nation?

22
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,880
One instance
when two nuclear bombs

23
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,200
were dropped at a place.
It's a historical event

24
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,400
of the tragedy of mankind.
There wasn't any Muslim there.

25
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,680
Islam and terrorism,
I disagree to the logic

26
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,920
that you have put forward
for it.

27
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,760
A lot more people were killed
during the second world war.

28
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
And even more people died
during the first world war.

29
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,080
If we only take the case
of Hitler's holocaust

30
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,600
then ten lakh people had died
at once in it.

31
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,480
But we never connected

32
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,960
Christians and terrorism.

33
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,480
Such events are neither caused
by Muslims nor Islam.

34
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,600
Terrorism is based on religion..
- Yes, it's religion.

35
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,360
Is religion different from a race?
- Yes, it's different.

36
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,040
Majority of Americans have
been killed by Americans.

37
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,200
It's the rubbish
of the entire world

38
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,360
that America is dumping there.

39
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,960
The number of people who die
in our country

40
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,560
because of terrorism is lesser
than the number of people

41
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,720
who get killed over there.

42
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,760
As you can see I am standing
on Dalal Street of Mumbai.

43
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,800
It has been surrounded
by the security personnel

44
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,600
on all the sides.
There is chaos everywhere.

45
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,560
And we have got to know
that 43 people have died

46
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,560
in this area where people come
to earn their daily bread.

47
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,960
Everyone is getting updates
about the blast today.

48
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,880
'The number of deaths
in the Mumbai blast'

49
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,040
'is more than 50.'

50
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,160
'There's news of bigger blasts
from Zaveri Bazaar'

51
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,040
'and Oshiwara area.'

52
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,560
'The city of Mumbai
woke up in the midst'

53
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,480
'of this terror in the morning.'

54
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,040
In this country's..
- It's pathetic..

55
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Mr. Shubha, I have got
one question for you.

56
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,440
Are the Muslims
getting targeted every time

57
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,280
for the sake
of the nation's security?

58
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,280
It's the rule of power.
- Exactly..

59
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,920
Where there is no life..
There's no love..

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,160
Not even right..
- Not even religion.. - There's..

61
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,880
There's no righteousness. - Not even
religion.. - Not even..

62
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,120
The matter is actually not about
religion. It's all about power.

63
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,960
If we try to look
into the scenario of Afghanistan

64
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,520
we'll find that it's all
because of power.

65
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,840
Even the case of the Rohingya's..
- You mean to say

66
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
that religion is just an excuse.

67
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,480
Whatever America is trying to do
we'll do that in return.

68
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,920
The event of 911
is based on this logic

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,240
or even the other acts
of terrorism..

70
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,720
And then these events
were connected to Islam.

71
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,440
No, that's actually wrong.

72
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,280
What..
What happened?

73
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,560
Ma'am, the taxi won't
go any further. - But why?

74
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,440
What's the issue?
- Are you a mechanic?

75
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,960
But.. - I said it won't go
any further. That's it!

76
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,760
I need to catch my train
at 5:00 p.m.

77
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,200
Didn't I say that I won't go?
- Hey, what's the matter?

78
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,880
You can't park your car here.

79
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,720
Just move it from here.
- The car has broken down..

80
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,560
Hey, go from here.
- Take away your car.

81
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,920
Why have you parked it here?
- Just move it away.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,760
Push it.
- Hey, go! Go..

83
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,040
Hey, help me.
- Push it to the side.

84
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,760
Come now.
Let the car be here.

85
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,160
Taxi.. - Hey..
Don't stop your car here.

86
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,520
Lift.. - The cars won't stop here.
Move from here..

87
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,080
Oh, God! - Keep moving..
- Taxi..

88
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,240
Sir, why are you not allowing
them to stop? I need a taxi.

89
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,960
You can't stop any taxi here.
Please go there.

90
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,600
Lift..

91
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,840
VT station?

92
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,200
Ranjan, please put her bags
in the trunk.

93
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,720
Thank you.
- Please get in.

94
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,800
Be careful.
- Thank you!

95
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,760
What is going on in this city?

96
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,640
Everybody is worried.

97
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,000
By the way, I am Abir.
Abir Chatterjee.

98
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,120
My name is Yasmin.

99
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,600
I would have been in trouble
if you didn't stop to help me.

100
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,080
That constable was not allowing
the taxis.. - Are you a Bengali?

101
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,400
No.. I am not a Bengali.
But I know the language well.

102
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,400
You are quite good.

103
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,440
And look at me.. I couldn't
master my mother tongue yet.

104
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,760
Can someone guess
that I am a Bengali?

105
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,240
No, actually, I have spent 20
years in that city. That's why..

106
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,560
Just a moment..

107
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,440
Yes, Dad!
Yes, I am totally fine.

108
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,880
I was trying to call you.
There might have been some issue

109
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,040
with the network. - Okay..
- Yes, Dad.

110
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,840
Please don't worry.

111
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,320
I am going to the station now.

112
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,080
I'll call you
once the train departs, okay?

113
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,800
Okay? Don't forget
to take your medicines.

114
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,440
Bye..

115
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,880
He's worried.

116
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,000
Someone must have cast an evil
eye on this city. Six blasts.

117
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,480
I heard about one in Worli.

118
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,120
Oh, I see. Seven blasts?

119
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,480
Oh, God!

120
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,000
Bye.
- Thank you. Thank you.

121
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,200
Thank you.
- Okay.

122
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,840
Let's go. - Go there..
- Come on..

123
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,680
Move it.. - Sir, let me..
- Move..

124
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,120
Keep moving..
- Move..

125
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,920
Got it. Yes, sir.
All right, sir.

126
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,920
'The train from Mumbai to Howrah'

127
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,920
'is an hour late. It'll arrive
on platform number 21.'

128
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,000
Excuse me, where would I find
the upper-class waiting room?

129
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,160
Go straight and take right..
- Is it? - Yes. - Thank you.

130
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,960
'Platform number 21..
There's an announcement'

131
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,800
'Mumbai to Howrah Duronto express'

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,160
'is an hour late. It'll arrive

133
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,440
Hello.

134
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,880
Is the waiting room that way?
Thank you.

135
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,200
Come on, move that way.

136
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,800

140
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,560
Tea?

141
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,560
Would you kindly
keep an eye my luggage?

142
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,600
Thanks.

143
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,240
Burkha?
- Conservative family.

144
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,920
That's why, I have to wear it.

145
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,520
Hamidul Bhatkar. He is
well versed in English, French

146
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,160
Urdu, Hindi, Bengali.

147
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
He is operating from Bangladesh.

148
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,640
This is Usmaan Gani.
He can speak Hindi and Urdu.

149
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,920
He has the sole responsibility
of the sleeper cell.

150
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,720
Both are the leaders of the first
layer of IM, Indian Mujahideen.

151
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,760
Sir, we got some information
about the Mumbai blasts

152
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,120
from the same sources. We didn't
have any solid information.

153
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,240
From this morning, their target
has been to blow up 18 sites

154
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,400
one by one,
out of which seven are done.

155
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,200
However the remaining seven
were intercepted by us.

156
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,800
Sir, DCDD Damyanti Patekar
has come up with some

157
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
really interesting facts for us.

158
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,280
Go on.
- There is a unique code number

159
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,800
for each member of IM. We
retrieved similar code numbers

160
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,480
from the two people
whom we arrested today.

161
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,080
For example, 98ZPM9804

162
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,000
that is, two digits,
three letters

163
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,080
and then four digits again.
If these could be deciphered

164
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,440
then many could be exposed, sir.
- How much longer will it take?

165
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,760
The press have made
our lives miserable.

166
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,920
Sir, a complete team is working
hard, day and night on this case.

167
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,920
Sit down.
What is the position? Sit.

168
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,240
No not here. Go till Bilaspur.
Yes. Keep tracking.

169
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,560
All right. Nandu.
- Yes, ma'am. - No, sit down.

170
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,160
Any feedback?
- No.

171
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,920
Let me know if there's
any update, okay? - Yes.

172
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,440
Go there..

173
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,840
'The Mumbai-Howrah Duronto express
is late'

174
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,880
'by three hours and will depart
from platform number 21.'

175
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
If we can't depart today..

176
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,760
Oh, sorry!

177
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,440
Excuse me.
Hi!

178
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,320
Nice to see you again!
Where to?

179
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,480
Howrah? - Yes.
And you?

180
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,320
I am thinking about jumping
out during the journey.

181
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,360
Hey, ma'am. This train doesn't
stop at any other station.

182
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,840
Like you all say..
Yes!

183
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,960
One can go only till Howrah.

184
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,880
Watch your leg.

185
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,120
The train scheduled to depart
at 5:15 p.m.

186
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,120
is departing at 8:15 p.m.

187
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,800
You did leave the waiting room,
didn't you?

188
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,760
I had to meet a friend of mine.

189
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,280
'All the passengers
are requested..'

190
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,520
The train hasn't even departed,
and they fell asleep already!

191
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,480
Water.. The pantry is closed
tonight, there would be no food.

192
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,960
Water.. - Mister.
- Yes, ma'am?

193
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,520
Do you work for the railways?
- Yes.

194
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,720
Why won't there be any food?

195
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,320
Ma'am, there has been an explosion.
No one has turned up for work.

196
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,560
That's why the pantry is closed.
- And how much longer

197
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,160
until the train departs?
- How much longer?

198
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,520
The train will depart now.
- And you are telling us now?

199
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,720
What is this bloody nonsense?
If you'd told us earlier

200
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,600
we would have bought food
from the platform, right?

201
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,320
It's a 24 hour journey.
Damn it, they do as they please!

202
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,480
Why are you getting angry
with me needlessly?

203
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,080
Strange.. - Look, mister, don't
act innocent. - Wait, one moment.

204
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,440
Forget about it.

205
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,400
How many guards are there?
- Seven.

206
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,560
Seven?
- Seven. - Only seven? - Yes.

207
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,280
Hey, the pantry is closed,
no food available!

208
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,280
By the looks of the state
of the security

209
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,680
there should have
been 17 guards.

210
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,800
We can't really blame
these pantry workers

211
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,320
by the looks of what is
going on throughout this city.

212
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,360
They did make an announcement.
Maybe, you didn't hear it.

213
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,800
I don't know.
- By the way

214
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,560
I had bought quite
a lot of food.

215
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,880
It will last tonight with ease.

216
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,200
Who knows what'll happen tomorrow?
- No.. What are you..

217
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,120
Live life to the fullest. - Please,
how can I eat your share of food?

218
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,720
Not at all..
- Yes.. You have a point.

219
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,080
What if the food is laced?

220
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,920
I seriously did not mean that.
- What if I run away

221
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,360
with all your luggage?

222
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,920
I did not mean that.

223
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,640
This is what has been going on.
This happens frequently

224
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,200
on trains.
But I swear, ma'am

225
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,760
I didn't board the train

226
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,960
to drug you.
- Did I ever say that?

227
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,040
Strange!
All right then.

228
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,800
We will see, when I feel hungry.
- Okay.

229
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,840
This is too funny!

230
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
The train didn't even depart
and they all started snoring!

231
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,280
They are really blessed

232
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,960
to be able to sleep anytime,
anywhere.

233
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,560
Do you snore too?
- Fortunately not. - You?

234
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,400
Unfortunately, yes.
- That's good!

235
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Three makes a company,
that's good luck.

236
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,200
Good. The train finally
departed.

237
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,360
Finally.

238
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,840
Hey, forget about him!

239
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,200
It means, that's enough,
my dear. Don't disturb anymore.

240
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,480
Not exactly.

241
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,320
Tell me.

242
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Are you feeling hungry?

243
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,480
I feel hungry
when the train starts moving.

244
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Come, let's eat.

245
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,440
After that, you can
continue reading the book

246
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,440
and I will go to sleep
while playing a game in my phone.

247
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,680
What do you say?
- Okay.

248
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,560
But I'm telling you again..

249
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,400
The amount of food you have
won't be enough.

250
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,600
Absolutely not.

251
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,240
I had a feeling that I would be
sharing my food with someone.

252
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
So

253
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,280
I packed extra.

254
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,200
You have a lot of girlfriends,
right?

255
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,400
A lot!

256
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,040
That is quite evident
in your flirtatious behaviour.

257
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,560
Seriously?

258
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,680
Tell me something.

259
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,800
If someone doesn't flirt with you

260
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
will you feel good?
- Nope..

261
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,680
That day turns out to be
a terrible one, right? - Yes..

262
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
Do you have a boyfriend?
- No!

263
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,800
What?
- No..

264
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,040
No, I don't eat meat.
I don't.. - Halal.

265
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,520
Yes.
This meat is halal.

266
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,400
I bought it from a shop
called Bade Miyan. My favourite.

267
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,240
Chicken. - That's enough..
- Just a little more.

268
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,000
Eat first, diet later.

269
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,760
What do you do?
- Roti..

270
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,720
I work
for a tour operating company.

271
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,000
Basically, I look
after the logistics

272
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,960
and

273
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,160
if there is a special client
then in that case

274
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,800
I go meet the person.
I have to do that.

275
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,120
Suppose..
If there is some work then..

276
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,000
Turkey, Greece, Germany..
Have you been to all these places?

277
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,720
Wow! - I had to go
to Barcelona, Spain.

278
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,800
Especially the countries in Europe.
I travel there a lot.

279
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,960
A lot of Bengalis travel there,
you see.

280
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,840
In that case, you must be having
a lot of passports.

281
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,320
After all, you travel every month.

282
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,920
'May I have your attention,
please? Train number..'

283
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,800
The food was good, wasn't it?

284
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,480
You got to know

285
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,680
everything about me.

286
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
But what do you do?

287
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,120
I take photos.

288
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
Oh, wow!
Photography?

289
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,640
Not really.

290
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,640
I shoot videos at times.

291
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,400
Oh, cinema?

292
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,040
Are you a cinematographer?

293
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,720
No, I mean..
Wait, I will show you.

294
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,600
After Lalu Prasad Yadav got
appointed as the Railway Minister

295
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,760
plug points were installed
in trains.

296
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Wait, let me check.

297
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,480
Mobile phone, laptop..
No problem.

298
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,720
And Mr. Sam Pitroda

299
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,440
raised the standards
of communication.

300
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,760
The internet might get disconnected
a few times in a running train.

301
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,400
Otherwise, it's perfect.

302
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,280
"Maybe you know,
maybe you don't.."

303
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,800
Good heavens!

304
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,680
You were actually able
to identify the song!

305
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,400
I couldn't have done it
had it been a Bengali song.

306
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,680
Like I told you,
I still haven't got a good grasp

307
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,040
on the language.

308
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,800
Who could possibly say that you
are actually not a Bengali?

309
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,120
Your Bengali is very good.

310
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,560
And you can impress

311
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,640
your fellow passengers
quite well too. - Nope.

312
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,200
A female fellow passenger.

313
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,560
Here you go.

314
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,760
My video.

315
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,800
Dad!

316
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,280
Don't make a sound.

317
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Firstly..

318
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,080
Everyone is sleeping.

319
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,400
They will wake up.

320
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,920
Secondly..

321
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,600
They can see us.

322
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,840
Hey.

323
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,600
Can you all hear us?
- Yes, we can. - Yes, we can.

324
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,080
They said that they can hear us.

325
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,720
Can you see this lady here?
- Yes, we can. - Yes, we can.

326
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,400
They said that they can see you.

327
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,000
So, is the gun loaded?
- Yes, it is. - Yes, it is.

328
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,320
They said that the gun is loaded.

329
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,960
But how will we know
that it is loaded?

330
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,840
Ma'am, I hope you understood.

331
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,960
The pistol is loaded.

332
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,880
It really is.

333
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,280
If you scream now

334
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,400
then they

335
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,320
will shoot him.

336
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,080
Who are you?
What do you want?

337
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Dad has asthma.
He is having breathing issues.

338
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,000
They will take care of that.

339
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,000
They will.

340
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,480
What do you want?

341
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,040
Why would you kill my dad?
- We won't kill him.

342
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
Why would we?

343
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,240
If you co-operate with us

344
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,120
then killing him
is out of the question.

345
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,760
Hey, move the pistol away.

346
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Her father is having
breathing issues.

347
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,960
Look for the inhaler.
He needs it. Come on, fast.

348
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,360
It's an emergency.
Quickly.

349
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,880
Hey, look over there.

350
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,280
Come here.

351
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,000
In what way can I-I co-operate?

352
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,600
What do I have to do?
Tell me.

353
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,120
Where is Imtiaz?

354
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,000
Where is Imtiaz?

355
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,880
Who is Imtiaz?

356
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,800
Who is he?

357
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,560
For God's sake,
I don't know anyone by that name.

358
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
I swear on Allah.

359
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,080
I don't know anyone named Imtiaz.

360
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,840
What has my father done to you all?

361
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,800
You are surely mistaken.
Please try to understand.

362
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,680
I-I will scream now.
- No.

363
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,080
Don't scream.

364
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,720
Just don't.

365
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,720
Your half-paralysed father
will be lying there.. Oh, yes..

366
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,280
One moment.

367
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Here's another video.

368
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,120
Does the school seem familiar?

369
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,320
'Ruksana!'

370
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,680
'Ruksana, please come here.'

371
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
'What are you doing?'

372
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,960
'Are you Ruksana?
- Yes.'

373
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
'This is for you.'

374
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,160
'Please take it.'

375
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,280
Ruksana!

376
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,240
Oh, for God's sake.. No!
Who are you?

377
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,080
Please let me go.
Let go of my father.

378
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,640
You are making a mistake,
believe me!

379
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,640
I really don't know anything.
I..

380
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,760
Please, I swear on Allah!

381
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,760
You are the best
of the human beings.

382
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,960
No one else.

383
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,640
You are the best. You..
You Muslims are the best

384
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,840
and

385
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,880
you are lying by swearing
on your very God!

386
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I am not lying.

387
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,480
Trust me.
I beg of you!

388
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,720
What did Ruksana do to you all?

389
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,360
You are making a mistake.
Believe me, please!

390
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,200
My name is Ya..
- Yasmin Khatun.

391
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,480
Your father's name
is Mohammed Firoz.

392
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,600
You have already
divorced your husband.

393
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,480
At least that's what
your loved ones know.

394
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,760
Mohammed Firdaus lives in Germany.

395
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,080
But I know

396
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,720
that you two are not divorced.

397
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,080
You two met last year

398
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,960
in Turkey. And your mother,
Tarina Khatun

399
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,760
passed away on 11th December, 1992
in Bhopal.

400
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,360
Surprised?

401
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,640
Do you recall anything?

402
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,760
"O Lord.."

403
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,160
"O Lord.."

404
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:20,960
"O Lord.."

405
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,040
Your uncle, aunt and their son..
All of them were scared.

406
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,000
There was news about riots
everywhere.

407
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,960
Scared, your uncle removed
the flag from the terrace.

408
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,640
9th December.
There were rumours in the city

409
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,680
that some people had attacked
the Hindu Hostel for girls.

410
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,960
The Navbharat Times published
this news on the tenth

411
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,480
and the news of their tyranny
was published by Jan Charcha.

412
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,640
A description
of how the girls were raped.

413
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,200
That was followed by trouble.
- Open the door..

414
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,880
The one to knock
at the door was Mr. Pandey

415
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,200
whom you considered an uncle.

416
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,880
Open the door..
- Kill the bastard!

417
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,520
Drag them out one by one!
No one should be spared!

418
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,920
Get the bastard!
- And he was accompanied

419
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,200
by countless strangers.

420
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,800
Kill them all!
Kill each and every one of them!

421
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,240
No one should be spared!

422
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Hey!

423
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,360
Come out!
Bring him outside!

424
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,280
Come on, come out..
Come out..

425
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,120
A peace parade began
on the 13th of December.

426
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,880
Even your aunt's ravaged corpse
was found

427
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,720
but it was said

428
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,040
that nothing of that sort
had happened in the girls hostel.

429
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,280
Nothing at all.

430
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,320
But the truth is, 31 people
had been killed in the city.

431
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,120
Countless homes were burnt.

432
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,960
Whose homes were they?

433
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,120
The best of mankind.

434
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,120
The people to whom God provided
the basic necessities.

435
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,200
The Muslims.

436
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,000
Your father was
in the Intelligence Bureau.

437
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,080
Your father worked
with the IB Department in Kolkata.

438
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,560
He moved to Kolkata
on the 13th of December.

439
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,960
Your father gave his house
in Bhopal to Mr. Pandey, legally.

440
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,680
So, Yasmin Khatun,
does all the information add up?

441
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,400
Where is Imtiaz?

442
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,480
Where is Imtiaz?

443
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,040
I would like to use the washroom.

444
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,280
Your mobile phone.

445
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,840
Hand it over.

446
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,440
There is another one.
I saw it.

447
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,360
Ms. Yasmin.
Sit down for a moment.

448
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Your father.

449
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,680
He is sleeping now.

450
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,560
Do come back
from the washroom quickly.

451
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,520
Hello?
- Hello? Mr. Tamal..

452
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,400
Yasmin here.
Yasmin!

453
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,720
Yes, tell me.

454
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,920
Mr. Tamal, listen..
Dad is in grave danger.

455
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,720
What!
- Listen to me..

456
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,320
Some goons have him at gunpoint.

457
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,960
I see.
- Please do something quickly.

458
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,320
Inform the police.
Do something.

459
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,880
Please..
- Yes.. Wait.

460
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,040
I don't know who they are.
They have my father at gunpoint.

461
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,120
Hello?

462
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,960
Hello.. Mr. Tamal?
Damn it!

463
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,920
Yes..
- Mr. Tamal?

464
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,840
Please be quick.. Please..
Dad is in grave danger. Please!

465
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,600
Yes..
I will do something.

466
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,080
'The runners..
And..'

467
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,920
'They're trying to make..'
- Yes? - Babli?

468
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,760
Oh, it's you, M-Mr. Tanmay!
Isn't M-Ms. B-Babli home?

469
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,520
All right.
Listen..

470
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,440
Some goons have my father
at gunpoint.

471
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,680
At gunpoint!

472
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,640
At gunpoint?
- Yes.

473
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,960
Gun..
- What!

474
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,960
Who's this?
- At home..

475
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,600
Where are you calling from?
Whose phone number is this?

476
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,480
Please..
Do something..

477
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
What!
- Yasmin here. Yasmin.

478
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,240
'Again..'
- Yasmin? - Hello?

479
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,200
Oh, that girl!
- Hello..

480
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,480
Hello?

481
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,720
Please.. Do something quickly.
- Where are you?

482
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,680
How did you come to know
about this?

483
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,360
I don't know who they are
or where they are from.

484
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,440
Where are you?
I can't hear anything!

485
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,440
Mr. Tanmay?

486
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,600
Damn!

487
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,000
The call got disconnected.

488
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,320
Yasmin?

489
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,600
Ms. Yasmin?

490
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,480
Ms. Yasmin?

491
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,320
Open the door.

492
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Open it.

493
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,720
What is the matter?

494
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,040
No..

495
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,640
This is of no use.

496
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,160
We don't work
without preparing well.

497
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,440
If you try anything again

498
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,000
then I will have your father killed

499
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,680
and I will finish you off.

500
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,840
Keep that in mind.

501
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,040
Hari..
No, sit. Yes.

502
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,640
Zoom on that.
A bit more.

503
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,960
DSP Mishra?

504
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,160
The SP's office?

505
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,200
Is this the SP's office?

506
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,000
Damn it!

507
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,200
What is the matter? - Move it,
you bastard! - Hey, what's this?

508
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,560
Move it..
- Who are you people?

509
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,920
What is going on?
- What are you doing?

510
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,240
I will call the police.. Hey..
- Move it.. Come on.. Why, you..

511
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,720
Hey, there he is!
Stop the car..

512
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,160
Hey, come on..
- What's the matter? - Move it..

513
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,640
Hey, move it.. Hey..
- Move it, you bastard!

514
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,960
What's the matter?
- Move it.. - Hey!

515
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,960
Come on.. - Hey..
- What the heck is this..

516
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,480
Hey, who are you people?
- Hey.. Hey, stop..

517
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,160
Why, you.. Bastard!
- Shut up..

518
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,680
The network is down presently.
Otherwise, I would have shown you

519
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,800
that your father is sleeping
and my men are guarding him.

520
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,080
My other men are stationed
outside Dowhill School.

521
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,720
They will be there all night.

522
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,120
Ruksana!

523
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,560
Ruksana, your 12-year-old cousin.
Your aunt's daughter.

524
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,320
The one you raised
after your aunt passed away.

525
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,080
She is sleeping in the hostel now.

526
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,960
Even I will take a nap.

527
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,760
If something happens
in the meantime..

528
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,200
I mean, if you call someone again

529
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,640
then your cousin in Darjeeling

530
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,880
your father in Alipore

531
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,360
and your husband, Firdaus,
in Frankfurt..

532
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,960
None of them will be spared.

533
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,400
By the way,
I never told you my name.

534
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,760
My name is Altaf.

535
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,480
Altaf Kabir.

536
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,640
I will take a nap.
In the meantime, you better decide

537
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,040
whether you will give me
Imtiaz's address or not.

538
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,440
This is the Duronto Express,
inaugurated by Mamata Banerjee.

539
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,760
It hardly makes any stops.
So, don't try anything.

540
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,880
Good night.

541
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,280
What have you decided?

542
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,720
You dozed off
while you were thinking.

543
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,720
Tell me.

544
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,760
Where is Imtiaz?

545
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,400
Let my father go right now!
Do it!

546
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,960
Or I will shoot you.
Call them up right now.

547
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,280
I will.

548
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,560
The men guarding
your father will leave.

549
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,840
The men stationed outside
Ruksana's hostel, Dowhill, Kurseong

550
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,360
will leave.

551
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,280
Even the men stationed
in Frankfurt will leave.

552
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,160
But that will happen only after
I find out where Imtiaz is.

553
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,800
I am not joking.

554
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,760
I am not joking!

555
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,680
Abir, Altaf..
Whoever or whatever you are

556
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,200
I am not joking!

557
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,240
Yes, you are.

558
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,520
Give me the gun.

559
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,560
What!

560
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,440
Yes, you were joking.

561
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,320
Bad joke.

562
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,440
There are no bullets in it.

563
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,160
Now, I am not joking.

564
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,200
Where is Imtiaz?

565
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,240
What is going on?
- What do you want, mister?

566
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,720
Is there any trouble?

567
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,360
Any problem?
- No, mister.

568
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,200
It's personal.
Forget it.

569
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,040
No, mister, this man has been..
- Just shut up!

570
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,520
Think of your father,
Ruksana, Firdaus..

571
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,880
Shut your mouth!

572
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,200
Hey, mister!
Why are you scolding her?

573
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,880
Ma'am, is there a problem?

574
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,240
Mister, I am telling you
for the last time..

575
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,760
Mind your own business.

576
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,320
Something is definitely wrong.

577
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,200
I feel something is not right.
I won't leave.

578
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,960
Don't poke your nose in this.
Last warning.

579
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,160
Get lost. - I won't leave.
What will you do?

580
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,240
Hanif!

581
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,840
Iqbal! - Yes, sir?
Where are you guys?

582
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,120
Come here!
- Yes.

583
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,080
Iqbal, get rid of the body.
Dump it outside

584
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,320
and yes.

585
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,960
If anyone tries something, then
don't hesitate to shoot him.

586
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,520
Hey, you.
Get down.

587
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,800
You have slept enough.
Get down.

588
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,600
Quickly.

589
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,160
Ma'am.
Sit there.

590
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,600
Go on.. Sit there.
Sit.

591
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,320
A person is dead
because of your tantrums.

592
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,160
Now let us come to the point.

593
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,680
Where is Imtiaz?

594
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,120
You don't have much time.
Then don't tell me

595
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,480
that I didn't warn you.

596
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,960
Where is

597
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,960
Imtiaz?

598
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,600
I don't know.

599
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,800
I really don't know!
- You do.

600
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,720
You really do know.

601
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,760
If you don't,
then your father does.

602
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,840
Bloody crook!

603
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,480
Your father was working for the IB

604
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,960
when Imtiaz was given
shelter at your place.

605
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,480
Wherever he is,
whether it's in India or abroad

606
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,560
I will surely kill him!
- My father was a mere clerk.

607
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,320
He used to work as a clerk
at a small department in the IB.

608
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,960
That's why he knows it..

609
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,120
That's why he knows where
that bastard is hiding!

610
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,680
Talk to me.

611
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,000
Don't hide him.
Speak up!

612
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,520
Wait..

613
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,040
Okay..

614
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,840
Give me a few hints, will you?

615
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,560
Is it related to some bank robbery?

616
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,840
What?

617
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,320
Bank.. Bank robbery?

618
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,160
Do you think it's a joke?

619
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,120
Are you trying to act smart?

620
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,400
Having fun, are you?

621
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,840
Look, ma'am.

622
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,480
You will have to tell me.

623
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,880
You will have to tell me
before we reach Howrah.

624
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,880
In order to catch Imtiaz,
I can't kill one

625
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,720
but countless people.

626
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,840
I swore in the name Islam

627
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,560
that I will kill all my enemies.

628
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,600
Verse number 25.

629
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,960
Paragraph number 52.

630
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,960
It's written in the Quran

631
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,920
to not follow the irreligious.

632
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,960
Always keep fighting against them.

633
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,720
Yes, I am a jihadi.

634
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,960
I am a jihadi.

635
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,480
We have exhibited
our power everywhere

636
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,080
from the American Twin Towers
to the Indian Parliament.

637
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,200
We have shown our power everywhere!

638
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,840
He betrayed our belief.

639
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,200
Probably, I can help you.

640
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,080
Tell me about it.

641
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,480
If I know something,
I will tell you.

642
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,920
You know everything.
Everything.

643
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,400
Year 2012.
November 18, Kolkata.

644
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,240
Indian Mujahidin's sleeper cell
was activated.

645
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,840
A few explosions.

646
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,040
The entire eastern region
was subdued.

647
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,520
Ashraf was our contact in Kolkata.

648
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,960
One of us came from Hyderabad.

649
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,800
Another one came from Guwahati.

650
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,120
Parvez was from Hyderabad.

651
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,960
Imtiaz from Guwahati.

652
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,480
Fourteen.. I will do
twenty repetitions. - Fifteen..

653
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,400
Sixteen..

654
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,080
Seventeen..

655
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,400
Eighteen..

656
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,040
Nineteen..
- One more!

657
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,080
Twenty. That's it!
- God!

658
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,520
Was it done properly?
- Absolutely.

659
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,040
Mother.

660
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,840
Mother!

661
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,240
Get two more rotis for me.

662
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,280
Here.

663
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,600
Eat.

664
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,760
Mr. Ashraf.

665
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,720
Anyway

666
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,880
I don't know if I will get
to eat rotis

667
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,440
after a few days.

668
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,760
Why?
Are you scared?

669
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,720
Jihad is for The Almighty!

670
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:08,320
Jihad..

671
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,960
God!

672
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,240
Sealdah subway.

673
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,960
10 a.m.

674
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:43,040
If things go accordingly here,
then 200-250 will be blown to bits.

675
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,720
What about Howrah?

676
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,120
No chance.
High security.

677
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,800
A better place will be Burrabazar.

678
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,360
Lake Market?

679
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,160
No one will be there at 10:00 a.m.
and should the explosion happen

680
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,400
it has to be done
within half an hour.

681
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,800
Sequential explosions.

682
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,560
Esplanade.

683
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,120
Dharmatala.

684
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,560
That area is a bit secure.

685
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,040
But the target is fixed.

686
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,280
Mister, where is this
Raja Katra market?

687
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,960
Mister!
Mister, your bag.

688
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,400
Strange.. - Hey, you!
- What a strange man! - What?

689
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,520
Come here.
What is going on?

690
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,440
Is this bag yours?

691
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,240
Yes, that one.

692
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,200
Yes, it's mine.
- Get it.

693
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,160
Go!

694
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,680
Move!

695
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,640
I kept the bag there for a while.
I would have come to take it back.

696
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,320
Is there a bomb in it?
Take it out. Out with it!

697
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,560
Come here.
Come here!

698
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,880
Here.

699
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,920
What is in the bag?

700
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,600
What is it?

701
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,560
A diary and a tiffin box.
- Show them to me.

702
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,560
Open the bag!

703
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,640
What if it's a bomb?
Damn it!

704
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,000
Unzip the other one.

705
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,920
That one..

706
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,560
Open it.

707
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,040
Hey, that's potato curry.
Why are you all scared?

708
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,640
What happened?
Should I finish the whole thing?

709
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,640
Get lost!

710
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,960
Why have you people gathered here?
Go away!

711
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:15,480
"God is the greatest.."

712
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,920
Had it been the glorious days

713
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,640
they'd have invited their doom.
- Forget all that.

714
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,040
We're done with the recce.
I've finalised the place.

715
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,360
Now, we need to finalise the date..

716
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,640
I don't think
there is a lot of security

717
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,920
in Rash Behari
and the stations before it.

718
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,360
What do you say?

719
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,040
Listen, Sealdah Subway

720
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,600
is the perfect hit.
- Yes..

721
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,520
We're also done
with our final recce.

722
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,880
Now..

723
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,480
Imtiaz.
Imtiaz!

724
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,680
When will we be receiving
the final date?

725
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,960
Mr. Parvez..

726
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,400
We've got the date.

727
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,400
18th November.

728
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,240
Jihad..
- Jihad.. - Jihad..

729
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,120
We are doing this
in the name of Allah.

730
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,040
Imtiaz.
- Yes?

731
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,200
Hey, Imtiaz.

732
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,640
Hey..

733
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,680
What are you thinking about?

734
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,800
Had the bomb been in the tiffin box

735
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,080
it would've detonated
in your hands.

736
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,320
It is the grace of Allah.

737
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,680
I want

738
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,200
the sacrifice of a jihadi.

739
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,520
The sacrifice of a true jihadi...

740
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,280
Damn it.. A certain someone
got scared that day.

741
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,040
A jihadi

742
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,480
got scared.

743
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,920
Maybe he had a dream.

744
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,560
A dream about dying.

745
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,480
A blast..

746
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,560
A jihadi

747
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,160
got scared.

748
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,800
The next day

749
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,120
on 15th November, 2012..

750
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,760
The commandoes are ready, sir.

751
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,200
No, we aren't moving
from our positions.

752
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,880
Okay, sir.
Okay.. To the right.

753
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,280
How many?
How many people are hiding there?

754
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,880
Ashraf! Ashraf, get the weapons!
- To the right! - Ashraf, quick!

755
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,080
I'm upstairs.
Come upstairs.

756
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,040
Come upstairs, Parvez!

757
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,640
Parvez..
- Ashraf, cover me!

758
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,440
I'm going to the terrace!
- Parvez! - Ashraf, where are you?

759
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,240
Ashraf!

760
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,160
'You have been surrounded.'

761
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,920
'You have no option other than'

762
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,480
'surrendering yourselves.'
- What are you thinking about..

763
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,440
'The police and CRPF
have surrounded the place.'

764
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,080
'Our aim is not to kill anyone.'
- You bloody..

765
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,280
Ashraf.. Ashraf,
where are the cartridges?

766
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,160
They're downstairs.
- Cover me.

767
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,720
Cover me!
Cover me!

768
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,440
Ashraf!

769
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,440
The firing goes on and on and on..

770
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,200
Parvez kept firing
till his last breath.

771
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,120
Ashraf got killed
way before he did.

772
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,960
Do you know

773
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,720
how many times Parvez was shot?

774
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:05,960
Thirteen.

775
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,320
He got shot 13 times.

776
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,440
Because of whom?

777
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,960
Because of that traitor, Imtiaz!

778
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,720
Where is Imtiaz?

779
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,400
I want to find Imtiaz.

780
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,800
The Intelligence Bureau
has hidden him someplace safe.

781
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,280
Where..
Where?

782
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,480
Bombay, Delhi, Madras..
Where.. Where?

783
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,440
If I don't find Imtiaz

784
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,720
I swear on Allah

785
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,360
you can bid your father, your
friends and your husband, Firdaus

786
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,800
adieu.

787
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,400
Everyone.

788
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,960
Your father had his file.

789
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,120
Your father knows everything.

790
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,480
Where is Imtiaz?

791
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,560
Where is Imtiaz?

792
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,400
Where is Imtiaz?

793
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,440
Code number..

794
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,880
Code number.

795
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,000
You know nothing..

796
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,400
You know nothing!

797
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,320
You don't know that I,
Yasmin Khatun, at the age of six

798
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,200
had seen my sister being
gang raped by sadistic bastards.

799
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,560
That day, on 11th December

800
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,960
those effing bastards
gang raped my aunt

801
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,080
one after the other!

802
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,280
You know nothing.

803
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:28,440
Get the witch..

804
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,960
No! - Get her..
- What's going on..

805
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,320
They know..

806
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,520
Hey!

807
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,360
Hit them..

808
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,880
You dare bite the hands
that feed you!

809
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,760
You know nothing about loyalty!

810
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,320
Hit them..

811
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,600
You dare look at our women
with the wrong intentions, rascal!

812
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,200
Take everyone outside!

813
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,720
Everyone..

814
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,800
Dad didn't hand over the house
to them.

815
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,960
Listen, mister,
you cannot live here now.

816
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,720
Why?
- You'll have to leave.

817
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,840
No, I won't! - Put
your thumb impression on this.

818
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,280
They snatched the house from us
by holding a gun against his neck.

819
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,520
Put your thumb impression on this!

820
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,520
I said put your thumb impression
on this!

821
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,400
You dare mess with us, rascal!

822
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,760
Hold him.. - Dad..
- He will have to do it.

823
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,720
Rascal! - Dad, get up.. Dad!
- Rot in hell!

824
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,280
Then we came to Kolkata.

825
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,640
Ashraf's brother took care
of my dad and me.

826
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,240
I went to college, I got a job..

827
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,960
"We have come
to Your Holy Abode, O Lord.."

828
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,760
I was the main contact
of the sleeper cell

829
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,440
not Ashraf.

830
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,920
"Please give us something, O Lord.
- O Lord.."

831
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,480
"Please shower this land with
Your grace, O Lord. - O Lord.."

832
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,920
"Either snatch everything from us..
- O Lord.."

833
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,400
"Or give us everything, O Lord."

834
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,720
"O Lord."

835
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,800
"My Lord."

836
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,680
"We have come"

837
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,760
"to Your Holy Abode."

838
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,120
"We have come"

839
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,040
"to Your Holy Abode, O Lord."

840
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,200
"We have come"

841
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,800
"to Your Holy Abode, O Lord."

842
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,880
"We have come to You"

843
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,040
"O Lord."

844
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,320
"We have come"

845
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,040
"to Your Holy Abode, O Lord."

846
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,320
"Is it bliss or just You?"

847
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,800
"Is it insanity or just You?"

848
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,600
"Death is looming overhead."

849
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,840
"Is it life or just You?"

850
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,440
"I marvel at You.
I seek You."

851
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,960
"I think only of You.
I love only You."

852
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:44,280
"You are.."

853
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,640
"It is Your boundless mercy"

854
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,480
"that has brought us here."

855
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,600
"We have come to You on foot"

856
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,560
"to bask in Your glory."

857
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,760
"We have come"

858
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,720
"to Your Holy Abode, O Lord."

859
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,960
"O Lord!"

860
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:27,800
"O Lord!"

861
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:35,960
"O Lord!"

862
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,560
"If I could"

863
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,160
"get to see you, whom I have lost"

864
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,920
"just once.."

865
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,640
"I wish I could hold"

866
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,960
"that finger
which I had held once.."

867
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:04,360
"If only I could get back"

868
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,320
"the desserts made by my mother"

869
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,920
"and go to the places
my father took me to."

870
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,760
"He would take me to the fair"

871
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:19,400
"and even the circus."

872
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,520
"The heart houses"

873
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,320
"countless old memories!"

874
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,360
"If only
I could have those again.."

875
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,840
"Please give us something, O Lord.
- O Lord.."

876
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,360
"Please shower this land with
Your grace, O Lord. - O Lord.."

877
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,920
"Either snatch everything from us..
- O Lord.."

878
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:41,480
"Or give us everything, O Lord."

879
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:46,680
"O Lord."

880
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,640
"My Lord."

881
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,840
"We have come"

882
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:59,600
"to Your Holy Abode, O Lord."

883
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:04,840
"O Lord!"

884
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:12,640
"O Lord!"

885
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:21,080
"O Lord!"

886
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,440
Imtiaz used to address me
as his sister.

887
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,320
After the final recce,
the next afternoon..

888
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,080
Ma'am..
Hey, ma'am.

889
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,600
Give them their meals.
I won't be eating.

890
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,320
Are you unwell?

891
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,680
Sister, you and I
will go have Biryani today.

892
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,360
I see.
- Fine, go.

893
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,600
I don't like the Biryani they make.
It's awful.

894
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,040
I won't have Biryani either.
- Please move aside..

895
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,280
A home-cooked meal is much better.

896
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,640
What have you made, Sister?
- There's some chicken.

897
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,240
Sister, please hurry up.
- Hold on, let me take the bag.

898
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,880
Let's go.
- Let's go.

899
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,800
See you.
- Bye.

900
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,480
Bye.
- Yes..

901
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,200
Come on.

902
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,760
All of them
used to address me as 'sister'.

903
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,960
Why aren't they here? - Why?
I'm here.. - No, they didn't..

904
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,520
That's because Imtiaz
used to call me that.

905
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,920
So.. - You didn't come
that day either.. - That afternoon

906
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,480
after serving them their meal

907
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,600
we went to have some Biryani.

908
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,080
Send this to table number five..
- What will you have?

909
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,560
Chicken Biryani.
- Biryani..

910
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,800
That's where we got to know

911
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,680
that STF had killed them
in an encounter.

912
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,880
For table number two.. - It's here.
Go on, serve it to him.

913
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,520
'The STF officers..'

914
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:02,840
'Even they are firing..'

915
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,280
'The Police Commissioner,
along with an army of officers'

916
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,160
'has raided the place.'

917
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,120
'According to sources,
a few terrorists'

918
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,360
'with the intention of detonating
bombs in Kolkata..' - Sister..

919
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,880
'That's why they are here.'

920
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,920
'The police think
that their number is not great.'

921
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,840
'After receiving this information'

922
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,680
'the entire city
is paralysed with terror.'

923
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,720
'The Police Commissioner'

924
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,280
'has declared red alert
in the entire city.'

925
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,160
'However, they have no information'

926
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:33,720
'as to how they happened
to form their base here.'

927
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,400
'However, terror has gripped
the entire city.'

928
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,840
'But the government has requested
the citizens to remain calm.'

929
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,320
'The citizens are requested
not to..' - Imtiaz! Imtiaz..

930
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,240
Imtiaz.. Relax.. - 'Though the
sound of gunfire can be heard'

931
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:52,440
'there is no news..'
- Sister! - Relax..

932
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,760
It was the guy who had
given us shelter. - Let's go!

933
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,960
He's the one
who had tipped the police off.

934
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,480
Which one? - Let's go..
- It's that house, sir.

935
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,640
The police didn't have
our photographs

936
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,360
but that traitor told the police

937
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,960
that the two of us
were still alive.

938
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,960
Who are they?

939
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,400
This is Parvez and this is Ashraf.

940
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,280
There were two other people.

941
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,720
Where have they gone?
- I don't know, sir.

942
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:18,920
They went somewhere..

943
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,800
Then Imtiaz and I
went to another shelter.

944
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,200
All the arrangements
had been made there.

945
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,680
Detonator, RDX..
Everything.

946
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,200
We'll have to postpone it.

947
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,600
The security will get tightened.

948
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,640
No, Sister.

949
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,000
The blast will take place
on that day itself.

950
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,840
The blast will take place
on that day itself, Sister.

951
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,920
I swear on Mr. Ashraf
and Mr. Parvez..

952
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,560
The blast will take place
on that day itself.

953
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,760
Sister..

954
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,880
Sister, I don't want to live.

955
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,920
I'll go to Dharmatala Metro.

956
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,920
You need to pick an area.

957
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,920
On the morning of 18th November

958
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,680
he went and recited the Salah
in a nearby mosque.

959
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,040
He seemed very calm.

960
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,320
Sister, I swear on Allah

961
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,960
today, the whole of Kolkata

962
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,080
will witness a blast.

963
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,840
Where will you be going, Sister?

964
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,680
Burrabazar.

965
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,720
Goodbye, Sister.

966
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,440
Goodbye.

967
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,480
Goodbye.

968
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,880
Hey, mister. - Yes? - Where can I
find a confectionery here?

969
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,440
Go straight and then take a right.

970
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,080
So, I go straight
and then take a right? - Yes.

971
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,240
Okay, thank you.

972
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,640
Hey, stop!

973
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,320
Come here!

974
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,200
Hey, stop!
Hey! Hey!

975
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:59,160
Imtiaz became a martyr
like a true jihadi.

976
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,560
It was not Imtiaz's bomb

977
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,360
but mine that went off.

978
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,440
Thirteen people died that day

979
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,800
but Imtiaz became a martyr.

980
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,040
A true jihadi became a martyr.

981
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,280
Imtiaz was not a traitor.

982
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,760
Imtiaz could never be a traitor.

983
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,960
Imtiaz was a true jihadi.

984
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,080
Imtiaz was a true jihadi.

985
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,080
Imtiaz..

986
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,640
Jihadi..

987
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,240
Great.
It was great.

988
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,520
I loved this story of yours.

989
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,200
So, what does it all comes down to?
You're a jihadi.

990
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,680
One more thing..
And he..

991
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:19,960
And he is a beloved family member
of a true jihadi.

992
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,840
Nice.
Good story.

993
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,960
First, you said
that you didn't know Imtiaz

994
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,960
and now,
you've become a true jihadi!

995
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,920
Okay.
Yasmin Khatun.

996
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,120
Oh..
Yasmin Khatun, a true jihadi.

997
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,640
You need to tell me something.

998
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,720
The day you went to have Biryani..

999
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,680
What was the colour of the kurta
Parvez was wearing?

1000
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,960
Bye.
- Yes..

1001
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,960
White..
- Wrong!

1002
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,200
White..

1003
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:21,840
You call this white?

1004
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,320
He was wearing a blue kurta!

1005
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:30,880
Is this how you wish
to save that traitor?

1006
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,440
What do you think?

1007
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,320
That we've set about to do this
without any concrete information?

1008
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,480
Anyway..

1009
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,520
It's okay.

1010
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,120
You need to tell me something.

1011
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,960
Coming to the place
where you took shelter

1012
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,360
how many doors did it have?

1013
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,560
I can't remember.

1014
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,280
How many rooms were there?
- Two.

1015
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,200
I used to live in one and he..
- Quiet.. Quiet!

1016
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:04,680
What! What's this..
- Two rooms.. - What the..

1017
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,320
Is this a joke?
Is this a joke to you?

1018
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:10,840
Let me show you something.

1019
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,520
Hey, can you see?
- 'Yes, I can.'

1020
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,680
Can you hear me?
- 'Yes, I can hear you.'

1021
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,040
Kill the oldie!
- What! No! Please..

1022
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,480
No, mister.. - Kill him!
- Mister, please..

1023
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,880
Mister, no..
- Kill him!

1024
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:29,120
Code..
Show me your code again. Your..

1025
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:36,280
Code..

1026
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,640
My phone..

1027
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,120
Ma'am.
- Yes..

1028
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,360
Samastipur.. Samastipur!
Come on!

1029
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,360
Lock it!

1030
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,720
Hey, guys, Samastipur!

1031
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,040
Samastipur..
Yes, show me the location..

1032
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,920
Yes, fine..

1033
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,480
A green double-storied bungalow.
Hill Top Bungalow. Quick!

1034
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,320
Allah is the greatest..

1035
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:08,800
Allah is the greatest..

1036
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,760
Allah is the greatest.

1037
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,680
What is it?
- Sir, who are these people?

1038
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,600
What kind of people
are you recruiting?

1039
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,240
He is suspecting me!

1040
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,240
He is suspecting Imtiaz!

1041
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,080
He has held dad hostage!

1042
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,400
He has even held Ruksana hostage!

1043
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,760
Sir, he is suspecting me!

1044
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,720
Who are these people?
He's been uttering rubbish!

1045
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,320
Tell me what the code is.
- Just a second, sir.

1046
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,560
76PQM8310.

1047
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,360
Tell me the code again.
- 76PQM8310.

1048
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,720
Hello?

1049
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,920
Hey, what the.. Let's get out
of here.. - Let's go.. - Quick..

1050
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,800
Good shot.

1051
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,960
Come on,
let's take down both of them.

1052
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:00,040
One, two, three..
Shoot!

1053
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,400
Ashfaq?
Ashfaq!

1054
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,800
76PQM8310.

1055
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,440
Hello?
- My child.. That's not possible.

1056
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:22,560
Yes! Start the jammer.
Start the jammer, quick!

1057
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:23,920
Hello?
Hello?

1058
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:27,200
Sir, 76..
- Yasmin.

1059
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:30,080
Yasmin?
- ...PQ.. Hello?

1060
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,760
Oh, Lord..

1061
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,480
Take him..
Yes.

1062
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,440
Don't move.
Don't move!

1063
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,320
Yes..
Yes!

1064
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,760
We've got the leader..
- Yes! Yes!

1065
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,880
Yes! Nandu.. - Yes, ma'am..
- We caught him!

1066
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,600
Congratulations..
- The leader got arrested!

1067
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,560
Move!
Move!

1068
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,680
Move.
Move!

1069
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,000
Come..
Please sit.

1070
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,840
Yes.. I guess
the call got disconnected.

1071
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,400
Give me that.
I'll talk to him.

1072
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,520
I'll talk to him.

1073
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,920
Hello.
Hello, sir?

1074
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,240
Mr. Syed Abdul Rahim Tunda?
- What..

1075
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,640
Hello?

1076
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,400
I think the jammer
has scrambled the connection.

1077
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:53,560
You know him?
- Why wouldn't I?

1078
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,880
Indian Mujahideen,
third in command.

1079
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,360
Why wouldn't I know him?

1080
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,240
He's responsible
for 40 bomb blasts.

1081
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,680
At least 70 sleeper cells

1082
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,120
have been trained by him.

1083
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,760
You think I wouldn't know
Syed Abdul Rahim Tunda?

1084
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:13,720
However, I..
I didn't know where he lived.

1085
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,680
But now, I do.

1086
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,320
The credit goes to you.

1087
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,600
Sit down.

1088
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:32,680
By the way,
I am the DSP, an STF officer.

1089
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:34,960
Kabir.

1090
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,440
Altaf Kabir.

1091
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,800
I had located you
after the blasts in 2012

1092
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,920
but I didn't know

1093
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,600
that the reason
behind you coming to Mumbai

1094
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,440
was to activate
the sleeper cells there.

1095
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,400
Seven blasts..

1096
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,880
113 corpses, 113 families,
so much blood..

1097
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,200
Someone's father, someone's mother

1098
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,680
someone's brother,
someone's sister..

1099
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,880
Why?

1100
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,400
Why in the morning?

1101
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,400
I feel like finishing you off
right here.

1102
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:41,880
Don't look so shocked.

1103
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,720
Be it the taxi driver,
the announcement at the station

1104
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,760
or what happened
in the pantry car

1105
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,960
it was

1106
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,560
all orchestrated by me.

1107
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,040
My target was someone way bigger..

1108
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:58,880
My target
was Syed Abdul Rahim Tunda.

1109
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:02,920
Oh, yes.

1110
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:08,840
You were right.

1111
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,960
He was wearing a white kurta
that day.

1112
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,800
I doctored the photo.

1113
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,360
One more thing..

1114
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:24,720
Nihal.

1115
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,120
Nihal!

1116
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:33,040
'Jai Hind', sir! - Are you okay?
I hope you didn't get hurt.

1117
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,720
No, sir.
- Okay, take the position.

1118
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,800
'Jai Hind', sir!

1119
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,920
The entire compartment

1120
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,440
is filled with our officers.

1121
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,520
Even the person
you took the phone from

1122
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:48,240
was my officer.

1123
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:59,040
Both your friends,
Tamal and Tanmay..

1124
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,480
We let them go for we couldn't find
anything that linked them to this.

1125
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,840
You'll be home in some time.

1126
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,440
Your father is asleep right now.

1127
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,960
My men are taking care of him.

1128
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,680
Your sister, Ruksana,
is in a boarding house.

1129
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,080
She's well.

1130
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,360
However

1131
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,080
how long this wellness lasts

1132
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:24,960
depends

1133
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,880
on you.

1134
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,320
Good news.

1135
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:46,480
There's some good news
for you, ma'am.

1136
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,600
Indian Mujahideen,
third in command..

1137
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,560
Syed Abdul Rahim Tunda

1138
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,000
is under arrest.

1139
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:10,960
Oh, yes!

1140
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,640
I would like to say
just two things..

1141
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,520
Only two sentences.

1142
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,240
First..

1143
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,200
Jihad..

1144
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,360
It doesn't mean fighting people.

1145
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,200
It is a fight with oneself.

1146
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,640
To purify oneself.

1147
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:29,920
Second..

1148
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,360
You need to work on your lies.

1149
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,440
Yes, I agree things went haywire
in Bhopal that day

1150
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:37,360
owing to which, your mother died.

1151
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,960
That was completely unjust.

1152
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:40,600
That was a terrible thing
to happen.

1153
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:42,920
But you didn't tell me

1154
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:47,000
how several Hindus came to your
home that day to save you all.

1155
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:50,560
Had they not come to your rescue,
none of you would've survived.

1156
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,080
Neither Hindus nor Muslims
start a riot.

1157
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,840
The people who want a riot
are the ones who start it!

1158
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,040
And you're spreading hatred
by forgetting this stark truth

1159
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:06,160
killing people
and calling it jihad!

1160
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,800
You bloody non-believer.

1161
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:12,440
You won't find a place
in hell either.

1162
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,800
You unholy soul!

1163
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,960
Do you have any idea to what extent

1164
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,600
a true jihadi can go?

1165
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:29,000
Do you want to see our power?

1166
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,600
You'll take me to jail!

1167
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:00,360
You!

1168
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:08,080
Which jail?

1169
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:09,960
Which one?

1170
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,960
I hope you remember Kandahar.

1171
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,640
Mr. Syed..

1172
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,960
Maulana Masood Azhar..

1173
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,200
I bet you remember these people.

1174
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:35,720
Let it be..

1175
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,680
You..

1176
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,840
You will escort me in your jeep

1177
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,880
and help me cross the border.

1178
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,760
You will!

1179
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,560
And that day,
you will get a taste of our power!

1180
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,880
That day!

1181
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,480
Bloody non-believer..

1182
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,840
It is possible..

1183
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:26,360
It is possible.

1184
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,240
It

1185
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,040
is possible.

1186
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:11,360
Sir..
- I'm fine.

1187
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,320
Chatterjee.
- Yes, sir?

1188
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,160
Make sure you make a good report.
- Okay, sir. - Go on.

1189
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,240
I'll do it, sir.
Come on.

1190
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,760
Please sit, sir.

1191
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:11,960
{\an8}"The society is in disarray."

1192
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:15,360
{\an8}"The heart is like a battlefield."

1193
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:18,760
{\an8}"The truth is hiding in the dark."

1194
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,240
{\an8}"Let them search
high and low today."

1195
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:25,600
{\an8}"The society is in disarray!"

1196
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:29,080
{\an8}"The heart is like a battlefield!"

1197
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:32,520
{\an8}"The truth is hiding in the dark!
- Kabir!"

1198
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:36,000
{\an8}"Let them search
high and low today!"

1199
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,840
{\an8}"Why?"

1200
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:42,320
{\an8}"Why this monstrosity?"

1201
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,680
{\an8}"Amidst all the madness and chaos"

1202
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:49,440
{\an8}"will come the Lord Himself!"

1203
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:54,160
{\an8}"Kabir.."

1204
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,240
{\an8}"Every day, in the city"

1205
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:15,600
{\an8}"you come across familiar faces"

1206
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:21,160
{\an8}"on the streets and ports."

1207
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:26,040
{\an8}"In the evening"

1208
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,280
{\an8}"at the bus stops"

1209
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:35,080
{\an8}"man is losing himself.
Every day.."

1210
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,680
{\an8}"But the Lord knows.."

1211
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,920
{\an8}"He will usher in the truth."

1212
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:49,120
{\an8}"Kabir awaits it every day."

1213
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:53,400
{\an8}"Death terrorises people."

1214
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:56,760
{\an8}"The piercing sound
of explosives.."

1215
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:02,200
{\an8}"Kabir believes in the kind
of jihad which preaches peace."

1216
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:06,760
{\an8}"The society is in disarray."

1217
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,080
{\an8}"The heart is like a battlefield."

1218
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:13,720
{\an8}"The truth is hiding in the dark."

1219
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:15,360
{\an8}"Amidst all the madness and chaos"

1220
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:20,360
{\an8}"will come the Lord Himself!
- Hey.."

1221
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,720
{\an8}"Kabir!"

1222
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:27,600
{\an8}"Kabir.."

1223
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,840
{\an8}"Kabir.."

1224
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,320
{\an8}"Kabir.."

1225
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,640
{\an8}"Kabir.."
