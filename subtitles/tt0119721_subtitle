1
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:30,603
Justice is up for sale!

2
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:33,112
They're sellinga man's integrity!

3
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,342
There's a marketplace...

4
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,816
where these ''commodities
''are up for sale!

5
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:42,746
Demons now rule this land that
once belonged to Lord Rama.

6
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,520
The law has been defeated;
society is rendered impotent.

7
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:51,895
At every step here...
man is up for sale!

8
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,729
It's an open market...

9
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:55,826
where these commodities
are up for sale!

10
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:59,904
In exchange for money, or in
the name ofthe ballot papers...

11
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:04,235
in the name ofthe holy places
and in the name ofreligion...

12
00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:08,442
they're outbidding each other;,
because God is up for sale!

13
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:12,247
It's an open market, where these
commodities are up for sale.

14
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:14,919
The human race is
being plundered...

15
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:17,082
and the almighty
is still silent.

16
00:01:17,158 --> 00:01:19,820
To wipe outsins from
the face ofthe earth...

17
00:01:19,894 --> 00:01:23,990
why isn't the Angel ofDeath
ever born?

18
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:19,969
Will you guys speak up or
d'you intend to play mute?

19
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,442
We aren'tmeeting here
just for the heck ofit.

20
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:26,309
We're meeting to guide the
party through in the future.

21
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,349
We have the elections ahead.
We have to prepare a manifesto...

22
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:30,941
but you gentleman are...

23
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:36,518
Mr Girdhari... Mr Noor?
Mr Vinayak?

24
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:38,582
Why are you gentlemen silent?

25
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:41,355
You happen to be the senior
members ofthe Party!

26
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:44,159
The Party needs your guidance!

27
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,665
- Why don't you speak up?
-And say what?

28
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:48,725
Make promises, as usual?

29
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:53,602
And sing the litany of assurances
to put people to sleep for 5 years.

30
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:58,273
Make some minor changes in the
old manifesto and publish it!

31
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:02,476
Manifestos are no more than
a ritual nowadays.

32
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,781
Our promises mean
nothingmore thanjunk!

33
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,016
And how the public
loathes the sight ofus!

34
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:13,959
Politicians earlier entered a crowd
ofmillions, all on their own.

35
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:17,054
But now, to address
a motley crowd...

36
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:19,565
they cart alongno lesser
than a dozen commandos!

37
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:24,431
What has given them the
reason to fear anyone?

38
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:27,167
Why have we begun to
fear our own people?

39
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:32,905
Because, in all these years, we
haven't done a thing for the people.

40
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:40,576
Where is this politician-underworld
nexus taking this country to?

41
00:05:41,656 --> 00:05:46,593
Mahatma Gandhi said that when
the people have lost faith...

42
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:51,121
in the political leadership...
politicians will get lynched.

43
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:55,359
Which means all politicians
present here are thugs?!

44
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:59,930
You insinuate that the public
will beat us up, okay?

45
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:05,536
I'll convey your opinion to the
High Command this very day.

46
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:07,743
You needn't

47
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:11,216
The nation still has a leader,
Tirlochan Tripathi...

48
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:13,685
he's still following the
principles Gandhi laid down!

49
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:16,288
He has already formed
Goverment in several states.

50
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:18,484
Millions are willing to lay down
their lives for him!

51
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:22,960
Should we support him, we will
atleast have done a good deed.

52
00:06:23,097 --> 00:06:25,895
I will pray that your soul
rests in peace.

53
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:33,238
I have silenced the voices.

54
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:36,643
These voices that were raised
against you.

55
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:41,080
What the hell have
you done, Rana?!

56
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:45,608
Ijust wanted you to teach the guys
a lesson! And you've killed them!

57
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:49,313
With age, men tend to forget
home truths, Mr Mohanlal.

58
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,917
Which is why I've chosen to
disqualify them.

59
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:59,188
But how will I explain these deaths?
What do I do with these corpses?!

60
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,628
These crusaders belonged
to Gandhi's times!

61
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,935
They had a very clean image!

62
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:08,804
My political career is now...
- On the ascent!

63
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:16,709
You will weep tears for them.
And you will claim their ideals.

64
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,719
You will swear to bring
the assassins to the books.

65
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:22,722
And you will even institute
a Commission to probe the killing.

66
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,955
As for the bodies, you can tell
the newspapers that...

67
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:33,762
these 3 leading politicians
were victims ofa terrorist attack.

68
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:42,671
So you see how true leaders
are done away with?

69
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:45,303
Terrorists are being blamed.

70
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:49,475
But all three ofthem were victims
ofdirty politics.

71
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,347
And now they have been
eliminated!

72
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,583
They will now hold the customary
condolence meetings and shed tears.

73
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:58,919
The Goverment will institute
an enquiry into the deaths...

74
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:02,394
and a file will be prepared with
the findings of their slaying.

75
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:06,456
This file will rot in the records
as millions ofother files...

76
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,398
in goverment offices do!

77
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:14,597
And they accuse me
of talking nonsense!

78
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:18,336
Whereas, the Govermentseems to
be stuck with only one slogan;

79
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,415
The eradication ofpoverty.

80
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:26,612
They will, in the process,
wipe out ofthe poor themselves!

81
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:31,424
You will remember that when
Mr Mohanlal, the Minister...

82
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,492
contested the elections
for the first time...

83
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:38,496
all he owned were effects
to the extent of125 Rupees.

84
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,962
That too, in the clothes
in wore...

85
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:47,639
apart from loose change,
ofcourse.

86
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:51,906
But today, after 10 years
in office...

87
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:56,983
he owns assets
worth 1250 million!

88
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:01,321
Wath business does he
or his family run?

89
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:03,582
They used to sell bananas
at 2 Rupees a dozen!

90
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:10,522
Stop clapping and apply
your mind to the problem.

91
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:12,689
Where did he get all
the money from?

92
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,892
From your pockets, ofcourse!

93
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,863
Rise now! Awaken!

94
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:24,467
Make proper use ofthe rights
the Constitution has given you...

95
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:28,946
and throw out the dishonest
leaders who occupy their chairs!

96
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:33,479
They have sworn to be cremated
with the chair...

97
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:36,749
...but they won't let go
oftheir high offices!

98
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:42,720
The politics they adopt has
only one meaning...

99
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:45,855
to rule without policies!

100
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,699
I will say nothingmore.

101
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:52,397
It's for you to decide.
All glories to India!

102
00:09:57,945 --> 00:09:59,936
This house is more
like a Home!

103
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:05,010
They have planks here
to sit on!

104
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:08,583
Greetings, Mr Mohanlal.

105
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:11,581
Please come and sit down.

106
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:16,929
I don't have imported
furniture, Mr Mohanlal.

107
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:20,261
Please make yourselfcomfortable
on the mattresses.

108
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:28,608
So what have you decided?

109
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:31,836
Which party are you aligning with
in the forthcoming elections?

110
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:35,472
We will ally with the public.

111
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:41,615
Mr Tirlochan Tripathi!

112
00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:45,622
Please don't take my
proposal lightly.

113
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:49,557
Should we align forces, we can
win the elections here...

114
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:52,632
and rule over the country, too.

115
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,635
It's only power that
you're hungry for.

116
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:59,631
Aren't you satisfied with the
millions you have swindled?

117
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,776
Do you need our help to plunder
the country even further?

118
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:07,641
I'm sorry, sir, but you're not
altogether innocent either.

119
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:10,682
Even in the states where
your party is in power...

120
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:12,809
...there has been no
rule ofrighteousness.

121
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:19,790
How's that possible with demons
like you around in the country?

122
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,919
When have you let us rule in peace,
even in the states...

123
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:25,522
where our party
is in power?

124
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,759
You've found some excuse
or the other...

125
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:30,529
to dismiss our goverments and
impose President's rule.

126
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:33,539
-Do you have any principles...
- You are..

127
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:37,304
All you want is power!
To remain in office!

128
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:40,311
No matter whose help you
have to seek!

129
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:44,543
I'm ashamed ofmyselfwhen people
like you rule the country!

130
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:48,615
I wonder what's come over the
minds of the people in the country.

131
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:50,553
They're probably rotting.

132
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:52,956
They're the same people who
drove away the British...

133
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:54,927
and won India
her Independence!

134
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:59,054
But they're now slaves to politicians
who are thugs like you!

135
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:03,363
That's enough! You've spoken
enough, Mr Tripathi!

136
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:06,302
Just because you've formed a
goverment in a couple ofstates...

137
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:08,364
you think you've
become God Himself!

138
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:14,175
Don't forget, Mr Tripathi,
the public has a short memory.

139
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:16,978
You never know when the
scales will tilt!

140
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:20,646
I will leave, but you must
always remember...

141
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:23,757
No matter how weak
a walking-stick is...

142
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:25,791
itstill helps you walk.

143
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,893
- Good-bye.
- Wait, Mr Mohanlal.

144
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,124
I do all my work on my own.
I have no servants.

145
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:38,329
I will not clean the dirt
youjustspat out.

146
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:41,464
You must clean it, because
it is you who spat it out.

147
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:47,711
This is an insult, Mr Tripathi!

148
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:51,476
Is it an insult to clean the
mess one has created?

149
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:54,849
You clean yourselfin the loo,
don't you?

150
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:57,548
Or do you have a servant
even for that?

151
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:00,917
So hat's wrong with cleaning
what you've just spat out?

152
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,823
You can leave, after
you've cleaned the mess.

153
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:18,739
Think ofsomething, Rana!
And think quickly!

154
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,112
I'm dyingto lay a wreath
on Tripathi's body!

155
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,912
Whether you kill him...

156
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:29,216
or bury him alive
makes no difference to me!

157
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:33,554
Besides, I will pay you as much
as you wish for thejob.

158
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:35,525
I guarantee that!

159
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:40,832
Very well. But I will accept the
payment only in foreign currency.

160
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:44,631
The moment you pay us there,
we'll pull it offfor you.

161
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:46,830
But how will you do that?

162
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:50,273
You'd better leave that
to my genius.

163
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:54,775
I'll arrange TT's death
in such a manner...

164
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:57,713
that the nation will give
it up for an accident.

165
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:00,684
The operation will be carried out
by our suicide squad.

166
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:03,619
At 11 a.m. tomorrow...

167
00:14:03,724 --> 00:14:06,659
TT's life comes to halt forever.

168
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,265
What does the report say,
Dr. Siddiqui?

169
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:57,677
We'll have to save Mr TT
at any cost, DrSiddiqui!

170
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:00,939
Our nation can't find a leader
ofhis stature at this stage!

171
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:05,380
I know that. But only a miracle
can save him now.

172
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,043
And who can pull off
the miracle?

173
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,745
There's only one doctor
who can do that.

174
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:10,722
Doctor Ramprasad Ghayal.

175
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:33,273
This is DrSiddiqui here.

176
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,500
Mr TThas met with a
very serious accident.

177
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:39,009
We must perform an operation
immediately. Please come over.

178
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:43,873
Okay, DrSiddiqui.
I'm comingover.

179
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:53,920
Dr Ghayal seems to have arrived.

180
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:09,198
Mr TTis our saviour, doctor!
Please save him!

181
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:13,640
We begofyou, doctor!
Please save him.

182
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,240
He's a God-send for us workers.
Please save him, doctor.

183
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:20,751
You are the God who can save him
today, doctor! Only you can!

184
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:30,558
He's a drunkard! He might
operate on the wrong organ!

185
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:36,031
You say that for the doctor?
He's an angel!

186
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:39,570
He only saves lives...
never takes them!

187
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,567
Here's doctor Ramprasad Ghayal!

188
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:46,406
No matter what you do...
you mustsave Mr TT!

189
00:17:46,546 --> 00:17:48,912
In this nation of
ours, Commissioner...

190
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:55,218
It's people like this who
are messiahs, Commissioner.

191
00:17:55,355 --> 00:17:57,915
I can swear by anything, I've
never met a doctor like him!

192
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:01,585
He's not even in his senses...
but his fingers work magic!

193
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:05,821
True. No wonder he has never
failed in a surgery earlier.

194
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,839
Go ahead.
I'll follow you.

195
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:58,742
Amiracle! You've pulled off
a miracle, doctor!

196
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:03,914
Havingsaved an honest and
upright leader...

197
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:07,715
you've done the nation and
its people a great favour!

198
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:10,345
Long live Doctor Ghayal!

199
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:17,996
Long live Doctor Ghayal!

200
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:33,534
- Janki... Janki!
- I'm coming!

201
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,272
-Bharat!
- Yes, brother?

202
00:20:35,348 --> 00:20:39,910
Where are you? The operation on
Mr T.T. has been successful!

203
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:43,487
What?! Was the operation on
Mr T.T. a success?

204
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:47,684
You musdt tank the Almighty for
having given you magical powers.

205
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:51,297
You're right.
Thank you, O Lord...

206
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:57,368
I also want to thank my brother
and my wife...

207
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:58,903
for whose sake I live.

208
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:04,567
Look,Janki... God has fulfilled
all your wishes.

209
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:11,848
You wanted my name spread through
out the country, didn't you?

210
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:13,782
Wait for the morning
newspapers.

211
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,016
Every newspaper will carry
my name in the headlines!

212
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:24,224
let's celebrate the occasion
with some sweets, then.

213
00:21:24,364 --> 00:21:26,594
Have some sweets...

214
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,863
Come on... have this.

215
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,803
Come on! What are you
staring at my face for?

216
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,709
Hey! I hope the two of you haven't
ganged up against me again?!

217
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,810
Come and have the sweets...
Come along!

218
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:49,953
Whom are you feeding
the sweets to, sir?

219
00:21:50,624 --> 00:21:53,286
For how long will you keep
dreaming like this?

220
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,469
Whom will you feed, now that they
are no longer alive to have it?

221
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:13,573
Not their lifeless
portraitts, surely?

222
00:22:43,877 --> 00:22:48,371
The truth does knock
on my mind, but...

223
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:50,607
I still can't hear it.

224
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:57,017
Oh! The memories of
Janki and Bharat!

225
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,785
The memories keep
coming back to me!

226
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:04,220
I just can't see
anything else!

227
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,030
They'rejust too loud.

228
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:04,854
How will going to the
hospital help, son?

229
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:09,799
It will alleviate my pain
to some extent...

230
00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:12,871
but it can't put off
my death, can it?

231
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:19,408
It was my worries that kept
puttingoffdeath till now.

232
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:21,877
What worries are they, Mom,
that I can't take care of?

233
00:28:24,384 --> 00:28:25,851
My son...

234
00:28:30,623 --> 00:28:35,253
After I'm dead, he shall be
your responsibility, son.

235
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:39,958
Although Bharat happens to be my
brother, as far as relationships go...

236
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:42,795
I've always considered him
to be my son.

237
00:28:44,637 --> 00:28:47,902
Yes, Mom. He's my son.

238
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:59,977
Janki... you shall be the mother
in the family, after I'm dead.

239
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:03,648
You will undoubtedly
love your children,

240
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,724
when you give
birth to them.

241
00:29:07,593 --> 00:29:13,463
However, do reserve some love
and affection for my son, too.

242
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:22,103
Please don't take offence. I can't
help saying that as a mother.

243
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:26,869
Not at all. You're only teaching
me to be a good mother.

244
00:29:27,914 --> 00:29:31,611
It hardly matters that my husband
was not born ofyou.

245
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:35,616
You have given him more affection
than you've given your own son.

246
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:39,851
So, I will consider Bharat
to be my first-born, too.

247
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:45,497
Had only mothers to
deliver their kids,...

248
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:47,792
it would render so many
relationships meaningless.

249
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:50,701
-My dear...
-I give you my word.

250
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:55,639
Till Bharat gets to be
25 years ofage...

251
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:57,743
I shall not have my own baby.

252
00:29:57,877 --> 00:29:59,367
No! Don'tsay that!

253
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,483
I can't even imagine Ram
going without children!

254
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:08,008
Mother...

255
00:30:13,593 --> 00:30:15,083
You'll be okay, mother.

256
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,137
Why don't you speak?!

257
00:30:27,507 --> 00:30:31,034
Why don't you speak?
What's wrong with you?!

258
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:35,547
You can't leave me like this, Mom!
You can't!

259
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,595
Don'task me!
Just do as you please!

260
00:31:32,738 --> 00:31:35,104
At least hear me out,
sister-in-law!

261
00:31:35,274 --> 00:31:38,766
Something wrong between them...
What's happened,Janki?

262
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:41,470
I'm fed up ofthis. You can drill
some sense into his head.

263
00:31:41,614 --> 00:31:46,108
Like a kid, he insists every year
that he won'tcelebrate his birthday!

264
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:49,618
I see! Well, mister...
What do you wish to do?

265
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:52,282
Don't rub the finance department
the wrong way...

266
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:54,189
you won't get any
project through!

267
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:56,261
She doesn'teven listen
to me nowadays!

268
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:58,329
I have no such problem, brother.

269
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,627
Ijust have to talk to her sweetly
and she'll agree!

270
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:03,632
How can she remain
angry with me?

271
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:05,660
Of course I'm angry with you!

272
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:07,636
Can't you agree for the
sake ofour happiness?

273
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:10,232
I'd even lay down my life
for your happiness.

274
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:12,573
Shut up! You'll get
a slap from me!

275
00:32:12,912 --> 00:32:15,403
Why don't you talk to him? Can't
you hear the nonsense he's talking?

276
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:18,881
This is between the two ofyou;
don't dragme into this.

277
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:21,816
Not true, brother.
This has to do with all ofus.

278
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:28,318
Now that you have sacrificed
all yourjoys for my sake...

279
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:30,452
how can I be expected to
celebrate anything?

280
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:39,266
Don't we share our
joys together?

281
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:42,472
Aren'tourjoys meant
for all ofus?

282
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:44,269
Isn't that true,
sister-in-law?

283
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:49,508
We'll celebrate my birthday when
the pledge sister-in-law made...

284
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:53,015
to mother is fulfilled.

285
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:37,687
This is no time to come, Renu.
You promised...

286
00:34:37,857 --> 00:34:41,258
I was here even before
I promised I'd arrive.

287
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:46,897
All I wanted to see was
whether you'd be miss me.

288
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,863
That's an understatement, Renu!

289
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:52,665
He fell offthe bed last night,
even as he remembered you!

290
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:56,566
Isn't that true? Must I tell
her everything else?

291
00:34:56,842 --> 00:34:59,276
Are you both fighting
even today?

292
00:34:59,412 --> 00:35:02,609
-No, brother.
- Then come and cut the cake.

293
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:18,455
That's a very big piece...
give me a smaller one.

294
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:20,692
Open your mouth.

295
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:32,136
Congratulations, Dr. Ram!
It's nice to see you happy.

296
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:36,345
Thank you, Dr Siddiqui. It's a
happy day for our family today.

297
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:39,848
His birthday that we're celebrating
after years is indeed a happy...

298
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:42,453
There's going to be another
good news soon.

299
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:47,025
- What is that?
-It'll be the arrival ofmy nephew.

300
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:50,720
Exactly 10 months from now...

301
00:35:50,863 --> 00:35:53,764
my little nephew
will play with me!

302
00:35:58,971 --> 00:36:02,270
Exchanging glances with her isn't
going to help you, brother.

303
00:36:03,342 --> 00:36:05,173
Treat this as an
ultimatum!

304
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:07,939
You mustsolve my problem
in the next 10 months!

305
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:12,849
Hear that? He's given us a
grace period ofone month.

306
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:15,545
Just go away from here!

307
00:36:15,688 --> 00:36:18,782
I have indeed been taught
to respect my elders.

308
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:22,419
But they've never prevented me from
beating up those who try to bribe me!

309
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:27,055
You'd better think it over, Bharat.
This move will prove expensive.

310
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:31,567
Before I smash your head,just
get the hell out ofhere!

311
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:45,907
Your principles and honesty will
cost you dearly, engineer!

312
00:36:46,585 --> 00:36:47,574
let's go.

313
00:36:51,824 --> 00:36:54,520
What's the matter, Bharat?
Who were they?

314
00:36:54,593 --> 00:36:55,924
My colleagues.

315
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:59,656
They want me to accept a bribe and
pass a power-project at Pawan Ghat.

316
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:01,390
Never mind them now...

317
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:05,870
It's your birthday.Take your friends
out and have a nice time. Go on!

318
00:39:55,574 --> 00:39:57,701
What's up? What are you
dreaming of?

319
00:39:57,843 --> 00:40:01,506
Nothing. But who's the babe?

320
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:04,810
Whoever she is, she's engaged to
the guy in the red-coat.

321
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,314
You can't find that word
in my dictionary, okay?

322
00:41:18,524 --> 00:41:20,822
You don't understand. There's no
comparison between Rajni and you.

323
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:23,521
Ijust don't like your
relationship with her.

324
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:29,994
They call me Raja... Raja Tunga.

325
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:35,867
And I get anything I take a liking
to... no matter what the cost.

326
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:40,339
No matter how much you
go around with her...

327
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:43,346
Renu's eventuaçlly going 
to marry me some day.

328
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,907
I've taken a terrible
liking to Renu...

329
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:51,120
let me go!

330
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:54,646
I have an advice for you, doctor.

331
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,948
Just go home and talk to
your brother and tell him...

332
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,617
Not to mess with the Tunga family,
if you want to live in this city.

333
00:43:04,363 --> 00:43:07,958
I've heard your advice and I'm sorry
to hear of your mental bankruptcy.

334
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:11,461
Now please register my complaint
and arrest Raja immediately.

335
00:43:11,637 --> 00:43:14,663
Neither will I register the complaint
nor will Raja be arrested.

336
00:43:14,806 --> 00:43:17,639
But your family will
surely land in trouble.

337
00:43:17,776 --> 00:43:22,213
Before Rana Tunga gets to hear of
this, I suggest you forget it.

338
00:43:22,648 --> 00:43:26,914
A whore in nun's clothing
still remains a whore.

339
00:43:27,886 --> 00:43:30,514
What have you worn that
uniform for?

340
00:43:30,689 --> 00:43:34,523
Ifyou have sold your soul to the
thugs, let them have your body too!

341
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:36,857
Have you said what you wished to?
Are you happy now?

342
00:43:36,995 --> 00:43:40,431
Please go away now!
I'm in no mood for sermons!

343
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:47,836
You must be a slave to Tunga;
not me.

344
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:53,107
Just remember that you're forcing
a simple man into this.

345
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:55,872
What?! Are you going
to take to arms?

346
00:43:56,014 --> 00:44:00,508
Will a doctor get violent?
You will do nothingofthe sort!

347
00:44:00,652 --> 00:44:04,554
When you couldn't prevent crime,
how'll you prevent the reprisal?

348
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,485
Even the Gods had taken to
arms against injustice.

349
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:09,993
I'm a mere human-being.

350
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:28,571
Not one police station is prepared
to register a complaint against you.

351
00:44:29,247 --> 00:44:30,771
Why is that the case?

352
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:36,788
The inspector said yours is
a family of decent people!

353
00:44:39,424 --> 00:44:40,584
Is that true?

354
00:44:42,828 --> 00:44:46,594
People at the police station
warned me that...

355
00:44:46,765 --> 00:44:49,256
ifI wished to live
in the city...

356
00:44:49,368 --> 00:44:51,598
I must keep my distance
from the Tunga family.

357
00:46:05,744 --> 00:46:07,541
They dare hit my brother!

358
00:46:21,388 --> 00:46:22,787
- It was that...
-Just shut up!

359
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:28,693
Someone has dared to beat up my
brother for the first ever time!

360
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:34,428
Just tell me his name, Raja!

361
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:37,765
I will wipe outevery
trace ofhis family!

362
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:47,946
No, brother. Wiping out
his family is not my goal.

363
00:46:48,114 --> 00:46:49,638
Then what do you
want to do?

364
00:46:55,822 --> 00:47:01,783
I want to snatch Bharat's love
and deal a blow to the brothers...

365
00:47:01,928 --> 00:47:10,131
that they will remember
all their lives!

366
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:13,465
- That's all I want!
-Just give me her name.

367
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,875
His love will be
a slave at your feet!

368
00:47:20,747 --> 00:47:26,947
It's the famous builder Umedchand
Jain's daughter, Renu.

369
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:31,157
Welcome Mr Rana Tunga!
This is a surprise!

370
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:33,953
I was at my prayers when
the servant told me.

371
00:47:34,094 --> 00:47:37,291
But how could I even pray
when I heard you had arrived?

372
00:47:37,364 --> 00:47:42,825
I've just come running here
with the bell in my hand!

373
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:46,501
- Have I done something wrong?
- Not at all.

374
00:47:46,706 --> 00:47:49,174
Your arrival at someone's house,
so early in the day...

375
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,176
can't bode well for anyone,
can it?

376
00:47:52,112 --> 00:47:53,704
You're wrong, MrJain.

377
00:47:54,281 --> 00:47:57,614
It's not necessary for me
to always hurt people.

378
00:47:57,751 --> 00:48:01,881
In the right position, I could
even change people's destinies.

379
00:48:02,322 --> 00:48:06,190
I hope that's true and my
prayers are answered!

380
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,527
Deign to tell me, sir... how are
you going to change my destiny?

381
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:15,394
And why are you standing?
Please sit down!

382
00:48:15,835 --> 00:48:20,272
I've come to invite you to my
younger brother, Raja's wedding.

383
00:48:22,842 --> 00:48:26,209
Is itjust that much?!
It's great news!

384
00:48:26,346 --> 00:48:29,406
Awedding in your house is like
a wedding in my own home!

385
00:48:29,549 --> 00:48:31,642
But why did you take the
trouble ofcoming here?

386
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:33,753
You could have sent the invitation
with your chauffeur.

387
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,879
You could have got someone
to telephone me!

388
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:40,484
I'd personally have come to collect
the card! Why take the trouble?

389
00:48:41,561 --> 00:48:45,156
I thought I must personally
invite you to the wedding.

390
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:47,664
- You're being magnanimous!
- Here's the invitation.

391
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:50,964
But tell me what you will have.
Asoft-drink? Or tea, perhaps?

392
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:54,431
We'll decide that after you
have read the invitation.

393
00:48:54,574 --> 00:48:57,702
Your brother is like my son!
Why see the invitation?

394
00:48:57,844 --> 00:49:00,813
You must obviously have spent
a lot on the invitation.

395
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,644
The bride's father must also be
ofyour own stature, what say?

396
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:27,965
I think you need a soft-drink.

397
00:49:28,141 --> 00:49:33,545
Asoft-drink?!
I'd rather have poison!

398
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,749
Is my daughter to
marry your brother?!

399
00:49:36,883 --> 00:49:38,680
You've had the
invitations printed...

400
00:49:38,752 --> 00:49:40,743
you must even have distributed
them all over town!

401
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,720
This will set the Jain
community after me!

402
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:45,519
Is there something lacking
in my brother, MrJain?

403
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:50,686
Not at all! But how can I be
compared to you?!

404
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:56,066
When I consider you my equal...
what's your problem?

405
00:49:56,236 --> 00:49:58,704
It has nothing to do
with my objections!

406
00:49:58,838 --> 00:50:01,398
It has to do with my
daughter's approval!

407
00:50:01,574 --> 00:50:05,670
It has to do with our community!
Why can't you understand that?!

408
00:50:05,845 --> 00:50:10,509
Raja is a very obstinate
boy, MrJain.

409
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,709
He insisted on the most expensive
toys, even when he was a kid.

410
00:50:14,854 --> 00:50:18,381
And I let him have every
priceless toy in the world.

411
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:20,720
He then took a fancy
to cars.

412
00:50:20,794 --> 00:50:25,390
And you will find the most
expensive cars in the world...

413
00:50:25,532 --> 00:50:27,466
rotting in our compound.

414
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:31,100
He has now asked me for
Renu's hand in marriage.

415
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,797
I will satisfy this
demand ofhis, too.

416
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:38,102
Besides, why will Renu object,
when you have no problems?

417
00:50:38,278 --> 00:50:40,473
I do object!

418
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:46,418
I am no expensive toy or gift you
can buy for your spoilt brother!

419
00:50:46,553 --> 00:50:49,545
- Listen, dear...
- I don't agree to this wedding!

420
00:50:50,023 --> 00:50:51,547
I will never agree to it!

421
00:50:55,295 --> 00:50:57,627
You speak like a true
daughter-in-law ofour family.

422
00:50:58,665 --> 00:51:02,897
Since you are going tojoin our
family as a daughter-in-law...

423
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:06,596
I will not get angry
at your misbehaviour.

424
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:12,472
Else, those refusing me something
just can't live in this town!

425
00:51:12,645 --> 00:51:16,342
You don't seem to have met people
who refuse to accept you as God!

426
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:20,579
I'm not scared ofthis man...
no matter who he is!

427
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,851
Let me tell him that I live
in this city and always will!

428
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:30,691
Without grovelling before him
or obeying his dictates!

429
00:51:41,674 --> 00:51:42,834
I must leave now.

430
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,706
See you tomorrow.

431
00:51:53,419 --> 00:51:55,853
Renu? Since when have you
been at the door?

432
00:51:56,022 --> 00:51:58,650
Ever since you have been
flirting with her...

433
00:51:58,792 --> 00:52:01,556
and promising to meet her soon!

434
00:52:02,796 --> 00:52:04,991
You're suspecting my
friendship with Rajni!

435
00:52:05,632 --> 00:52:10,501
The heart-shaped bouquet,
a love-letter, and a good-bye kiss...

436
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:13,266
can't be for nothing,
can it?

437
00:52:13,807 --> 00:52:15,604
But that's only good wishes
from a friend!

438
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:19,643
I know Rajni has studied
with you, Bharat.

439
00:52:19,779 --> 00:52:21,610
She may only be a friend.

440
00:52:21,748 --> 00:52:24,649
But her behaviour is
confirming my suspicions!

441
00:52:24,784 --> 00:52:26,251
I hope you are not...

442
00:52:26,753 --> 00:52:30,519
Ifthere is anyone I revere after
God, it is my sister-in-law.

443
00:52:31,024 --> 00:52:33,390
I swear in my sister-in-law's
name today...

444
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:38,327
that I have never
loved anyone but you.

445
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:41,664
It's true, Renu.

446
00:57:39,732 --> 00:57:42,360
That's the PPP file...
Don't you understand?

447
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:44,766
I mean, the Pawan Power Project.

448
00:57:44,904 --> 00:57:47,498
Aforeign-based company will now
supply power in the country.

449
00:57:47,807 --> 00:57:50,139
Since you are the engineer
on the project...

450
00:57:50,276 --> 00:57:53,803
your stamp ofapproval on the
project is absolutely essential.

451
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:58,746
Just put your signature on it.
I'll handle everything else.

452
00:58:01,354 --> 00:58:03,618
You don't reckon you're doing
something wrong, do you?

453
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:06,519
This is wrong, sir.

454
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:10,686
There are six tribal villages where
we want to build this project.

455
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,594
We obviously can't let them
drown in the project.

456
00:58:13,766 --> 00:58:15,825
Then, there are problems
ofenvironment...

457
00:58:16,135 --> 00:58:19,536
We'll solve that! It has to do
with another department.

458
00:58:19,672 --> 00:58:22,641
- Why must that worry you?
- It's my responsibility, sir.

459
00:58:22,775 --> 00:58:26,336
I can't deliberately endanger the
lives ofthousands ofpeople!

460
00:58:26,512 --> 00:58:30,175
But you want to endanger
your own life, don't you?

461
00:58:30,249 --> 00:58:33,616
Your speech smacks of
intimidation, sir!

462
00:58:33,753 --> 00:58:34,981
Sensible boy!

463
00:58:35,121 --> 00:58:40,058
You're a responsible leader, sir...
whom the public trusts.

464
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:44,125
But you... is this your
brand ofpolitics?

465
00:58:44,263 --> 00:58:46,163
Now look...

466
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:48,665
our culture does not
encourage...

467
00:58:48,801 --> 00:58:52,032
such exchange between
elders and youngsters.

468
00:58:52,171 --> 00:58:57,336
Politics is my business;
I know how I must go about it!

469
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:00,638
I can perform my
duties well, too, sir!

470
00:59:00,846 --> 00:59:04,680
It's true that I got thisjob,
thanks to your blessings.

471
00:59:04,817 --> 00:59:09,516
But I will perform my duties as my
ideals and principles bide me to!

472
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:14,386
I will do nothing that goes
against my conscience!

473
00:59:14,527 --> 00:59:18,759
I wouldn't mind losing my life
in upholding my values!

474
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:28,634
See that, dad? Even dogs are
more loyal than these human-beings.

475
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:30,867
You had done this
boy a favour.

476
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,502
But he's shown his true colours
and walked out.

477
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,543
It happens, my son.

478
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:39,142
When the brains don't work
in tandem with the mouth...

479
00:59:39,218 --> 00:59:40,947
this is what happens!

480
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:45,557
How'd the kid know the consequences
ofwhat he hasjust said?

481
00:59:46,892 --> 00:59:49,417
This is like killing two birds
with one stone.

482
00:59:49,495 --> 00:59:51,486
You will have accomplished
what you want to...

483
00:59:51,631 --> 00:59:53,724
and it will also
clear our path.

484
00:59:53,866 --> 00:59:58,496
To kill Bharat, therefore, I have
called Inspector Daanapani here.

485
00:59:58,671 --> 01:00:01,663
My plans have fallen in
place, too, brother.

486
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,332
The execution isjust
a phone-call away.

487
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:06,808
At 6 tomorrow evening,
that will happen, too.

488
01:00:06,912 --> 01:00:08,573
Make the call then!

489
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:16,511
There's still 5 minutes to six...
and there's the call!

490
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:22,518
This is Raja here...
Renu is in my custody.

491
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:26,789
Don't you even dare
touch Renu!

492
01:00:26,966 --> 01:00:30,697
Come and rescue her...
if you really love her so much.

493
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:34,806
She's at Hotel Savera...
Room # 504.

494
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:55,260
- He has already left.
- Where has he gone?

495
01:00:55,428 --> 01:00:57,521
There was a call from some
girl called Rajni.

496
01:00:57,663 --> 01:01:01,394
She called him over to Room
No. 504 at Hotel Savera.

497
01:01:02,435 --> 01:01:03,561
Let me go!

498
01:01:05,504 --> 01:01:07,165
Leave me alone, you swine!

499
01:01:15,514 --> 01:01:18,347
- Rajni?! What are you doing here?
- Let me go...!

500
01:01:21,187 --> 01:01:24,179
Help! Help me, someone!

501
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:56,547
She's dead.

502
01:01:57,022 --> 01:02:00,458
No, inspector! I haven't
killed her! It's the truth!

503
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,696
This is a frame-up!
Her killers have already fled!

504
01:02:04,864 --> 01:02:07,025
After they pushed the pistol
in your hands, I guess?

505
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:09,761
And also after giving the
girl, a tie you wear.

506
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:11,062
But inspector...

507
01:02:11,704 --> 01:02:13,729
These tooth-marks don't belong
to the girl, I suppose?

508
01:02:13,906 --> 01:02:15,897
You must've bitten yourself,
isn't it?

509
01:02:16,008 --> 01:02:19,171
And the nail-marks... you must
have scratched yourself, too?

510
01:02:19,345 --> 01:02:21,279
It's true that the
tie belongs to me...

511
01:02:21,313 --> 01:02:23,372
and the nail-marks have
been made by Rajni!

512
01:02:23,516 --> 01:02:26,508
But I haven't killed her!

513
01:02:27,386 --> 01:02:28,910
It's the truth, Renu!

514
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:32,214
That's enough. I've had
enough ofyour histrionics!

515
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:34,282
The court will decide
what is the truth.

516
01:02:37,763 --> 01:02:40,391
My brother can neither
rape nor kill someone!

517
01:02:40,533 --> 01:02:43,730
I know Bharat very well!
He'd never do that!

518
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,995
There you are!
You give him a nice name...

519
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,800
and sit back and relax!

520
01:02:49,275 --> 01:02:51,470
We're living in a
sinful era, doctor.

521
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:54,602
Names are merely for recognition;
not to guarantee good character!

522
01:02:55,347 --> 01:02:57,076
You are named after
Lord Rama, too.

523
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:58,946
Must I beg at your feet
for salvation then?

524
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:02,052
Not every demon is as
fortunate to do that.

525
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:05,190
Listen, mister! I've been
very courteous to you!

526
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:09,352
You're doing a favour to the law
by being courteous, aren't you?

527
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:13,226
The law which gives you the
right to slander someone?

528
01:03:13,365 --> 01:03:15,299
Besides, what proofdo you
have ofmy brother's guilt?

529
01:03:15,468 --> 01:03:18,494
I have enough proof
to hang a killer!

530
01:03:18,637 --> 01:03:20,502
The room in the hotel
was booked in his name.

531
01:03:20,573 --> 01:03:22,507
The revolver bore his
finger-prints.

532
01:03:22,575 --> 01:03:24,543
The testimonies ofthe staff
at the hotel...

533
01:03:24,677 --> 01:03:27,009
besides the eye-witness,
Bharat's girlfriend Renu!

534
01:03:28,447 --> 01:03:31,143
This is a frame-up and he's
being falsely implicated!

535
01:03:31,283 --> 01:03:34,081
It's obvious that you're only a
puppet dancing to someone's tunes!

536
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,485
My brother could never
rape a girl!

537
01:03:38,924 --> 01:03:42,621
Have you a medical reportsaying
he's not ''capable'' ofrape?

538
01:03:42,795 --> 01:03:44,524
That's enough, inspector!

539
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:47,392
Atongue is that which
you keep under control.

540
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:50,798
Let loose, it could destroy
many lives!

541
01:03:50,936 --> 01:03:52,927
You'd better hold your tongue!

542
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,407
You're not the last man
who can give usjustice.

543
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:01,104
My brother is innocent...
He will certainly getjustice!

544
01:04:25,804 --> 01:04:27,362
It's ofno use now.

545
01:04:27,506 --> 01:04:30,942
We got to know ofthis
pretty late, doctor.

546
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,408
Bring the body down, constable.

547
01:04:42,321 --> 01:04:43,913
Why have you
summoned me,jailer...

548
01:05:00,339 --> 01:05:01,829
What's wrong with my brother?

549
01:05:16,088 --> 01:05:21,321
Bharat! My brother...!
How could this happen!

550
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:29,160
How did this ever happen?!

551
01:05:30,269 --> 01:05:33,636
It's a case ofsuicide.
Perhaps... outofshame.

552
01:05:36,508 --> 01:05:41,502
Shame? What shame?!
What had my brother done?!

553
01:05:42,514 --> 01:05:44,038
What would he be
ashamed of?

554
01:05:44,783 --> 01:05:48,219
He was always a virtuous boy and
lived a life of righteousness!

555
01:05:48,354 --> 01:05:50,185
Why would he be ashamed?
What for?!

556
01:05:50,389 --> 01:05:54,291
I'm sorry, doctor, but that's
what we believe is true.

557
01:05:54,426 --> 01:05:55,950
Take a look at that.

558
01:05:56,795 --> 01:06:00,788
''Brother and sister-in-law...
please forgive me''

559
01:06:36,301 --> 01:06:37,928
What's happened to you, Bharat?

560
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,169
What's wrong with my Bharat?

561
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:47,902
What's happened to my son?!

562
01:06:55,587 --> 01:06:59,921
What's happened to Bharat?
What's wrong with him?

563
01:07:01,827 --> 01:07:06,696
Why don't you speak....?
What's wrong with him?

564
01:07:12,671 --> 01:07:14,764
Bharat is no more...

565
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:17,341
No! This can't be true!

566
01:07:17,476 --> 01:07:20,468
You're a doctor who has saved
innumerable lives from death!

567
01:07:20,612 --> 01:07:23,547
Give my Bharat back to me...
Give him back to me!

568
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:27,742
I'm only a doctor...
Not God!

569
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:30,483
I am not the Almighty!

570
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:34,157
You've let me down too,
haven't you?

571
01:07:34,993 --> 01:07:37,689
It was because ofyou that
I promised your mother...

572
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:39,957
and did not even
bear a child!

573
01:07:41,066 --> 01:07:46,504
For 14 long years, I consoled
myselfwith the feeling...

574
01:07:46,638 --> 01:07:49,766
that Bharat was my son!
My son!

575
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:58,707
And today... he has been
snatched away from me!

576
01:08:00,018 --> 01:08:04,045
This is an injustice!
Everyone has been unfair to me!

577
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,754
God has been unjust
with me, too!

578
01:08:07,392 --> 01:08:08,518
Why, oh why?!

579
01:08:33,886 --> 01:08:35,376
Hey, hold it!

580
01:08:36,221 --> 01:08:38,155
Stop singing and dancing.

581
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:40,622
This is a good sign;
they're taking away a bier.

582
01:09:04,283 --> 01:09:05,910
Here's the bride!

583
01:09:06,752 --> 01:09:08,515
Marry her!

584
01:09:09,822 --> 01:09:11,517
You've become a bride,
haven't you?

585
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:15,724
But take a look at Bharat!

586
01:09:16,395 --> 01:09:18,363
He's bathed in blood!

587
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,522
He's looking like a bridegroom;
your bridegroom!

588
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:23,327
Look at him!

589
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:28,333
Why is she wearing the
wedding vermillion, Ram?

590
01:09:28,841 --> 01:09:31,605
My Bharat hasn't
yet married her!

591
01:09:31,777 --> 01:09:33,768
Why is she wearing the
matrimonial vermillion...

592
01:09:34,813 --> 01:09:36,542
Stop it... stop it!

593
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:02,562
Sir...

594
01:10:11,617 --> 01:10:13,278
It's morning already, sir.

595
01:10:14,786 --> 01:10:18,517
And you went to sleep
withouteating last night?

596
01:10:19,658 --> 01:10:21,717
How can you go on
like this, sir?

597
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:32,533
When man embarks on his
journey through life...

598
01:10:32,804 --> 01:10:36,865
he knows not how
and when it will end.

599
01:10:39,044 --> 01:10:40,841
He treads along, nevertheless.

600
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:47,878
Falling and stumbling and
again steadying himself...

601
01:10:50,355 --> 01:10:51,947
he continues hisjourney.

602
01:10:53,358 --> 01:10:58,625
That's how he goes through
thejourney ofhis life.

603
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:01,960
But why has God made your
journey so difficult?

604
01:11:03,268 --> 01:11:05,498
You have always granted people
a new lease oflife!

605
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:16,812
That is one court where
no case is never contested.

606
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:23,781
Nor is there room for an appeal
against Hisjudgment.

607
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:33,925
He's the onlyJudge who delivers
the final verdict.

608
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:38,295
He's the OnlyJudge.

609
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:42,033
Read the newspapers, while
I go and fetch some breakfast.

610
01:11:57,889 --> 01:12:00,824
Dr. Ramprasad Bags the
Sanjeevani Award.

611
01:12:02,761 --> 01:12:04,353
Hats offyou to, Mr Mohanlal!

612
01:12:04,496 --> 01:12:06,657
You've had one ofthe
brothers knocked off.

613
01:12:06,798 --> 01:12:10,234
And you're now honouring the
other with an award!

614
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:13,762
Chameleons and politicians
belong to the same breed!

615
01:12:13,839 --> 01:12:16,000
You can never say when
they'd change colours.

616
01:12:16,074 --> 01:12:19,976
Which is why we've given Dr. Ram
the highest award in medicine.

617
01:12:20,112 --> 01:12:22,444
And I've had so much ofpraise
lavished on him ...

618
01:12:22,514 --> 01:12:26,143
that he'd forget even the grief
ofhis wife and brother's death!

619
01:12:26,284 --> 01:12:29,947
That's okay. But what colours
will you show me now?

620
01:12:30,122 --> 01:12:31,714
The colour ofrelationship!

621
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:35,521
The underworld and the politician
belong to the same brethren.

622
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:38,788
Ifwe don't help each other,
who will?

623
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,625
But what will I have to do?

624
01:12:40,665 --> 01:12:42,633
Ever since Bharat
was eliminated...

625
01:12:42,768 --> 01:12:46,568
the Pawan Power Project is
now in its final stages.

626
01:12:46,705 --> 01:12:50,664
But there is an obstacle
which only you can remove.

627
01:12:50,876 --> 01:12:52,776
- What obstacle is that?
- The obstacle is...

628
01:12:52,844 --> 01:12:54,778
the village oftribals
who live there.

629
01:12:54,946 --> 01:12:59,815
Fantastic! The young and the
old... they're all brilliant!

630
01:12:59,951 --> 01:13:03,148
- He's a smartchap, I say!
- He's my brother, after all.

631
01:13:03,321 --> 01:13:06,188
It will be done, Mohanlal.
Let's talk about my fees now.

632
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:11,218
Ofcourse you will get your share
as you have always got it!

633
01:13:11,363 --> 01:13:13,194
20 per cent ofthe spoils.

634
01:13:13,365 --> 01:13:15,492
Times have changed, Mr Mohanlal.

635
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,691
Things which were worth
thousands earlier,...

636
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:19,600
are now selling for millions.

637
01:13:19,738 --> 01:13:22,639
It's another matter that you've
been getting my brother...

638
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:25,072
to toe your line,
somehow or the other.

639
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:27,235
But that won't work anymore.

640
01:13:27,379 --> 01:13:32,510
As for our share...
it'll be 40%; not 20%

641
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:36,811
Ifit's okay with you,
you have a deal.

642
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:42,354
Or you know your way out.
- Don't be arrogant, young man!

643
01:13:42,494 --> 01:13:46,396
You mustn't forget that
the luxuries you enjoy...

644
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:50,126
are a result ofthe politicians'
sweat and blood, too!

645
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:53,066
Not the politicians... it's
the public's blood and sweat!

646
01:13:53,205 --> 01:13:55,696
The masses whom you have
always fooled...

647
01:13:55,841 --> 01:13:57,968
and robbed as part
ofyour profession.

648
01:13:58,143 --> 01:14:00,134
- Don't you dare...!
- Mohanlal!

649
01:14:01,179 --> 01:14:05,980
Don't forget your limits!
I hate loud voices!

650
01:14:06,118 --> 01:14:09,645
Treat what Raja has said
as my wish, too!

651
01:14:10,589 --> 01:14:13,251
Andjust you remember
another thing, Mohanlal!

652
01:14:13,391 --> 01:14:16,292
It's the combination ofmy reign
and your policies...

653
01:14:16,428 --> 01:14:21,024
which keep your brand
ofpolitics alive!

654
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:24,192
Didn't you say that politicians
and chameleons...

655
01:14:24,336 --> 01:14:27,635
...can change colours
at any time?

656
01:14:28,306 --> 01:14:32,208
Just you remember that.
Good-bye!

657
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:33,333
Wait!

658
01:14:35,413 --> 01:14:37,278
When you take the robe
offa man...

659
01:14:37,415 --> 01:14:39,383
you see him for
what he is!

660
01:14:39,518 --> 01:14:42,043
Make sure you remember that, too!

661
01:14:46,992 --> 01:14:49,620
There's only one way you
deal with a mad-dog, dad.

662
01:14:49,761 --> 01:14:51,888
You mustjust shoot it.

663
01:14:51,963 --> 01:14:56,127
No, my son! It's not good
to lose your temper!

664
01:14:57,135 --> 01:15:02,539
I will do no such thing that
harms my political career.

665
01:15:03,575 --> 01:15:05,566
The investigating agencies
and the courts...

666
01:15:05,644 --> 01:15:07,635
don't spare the politicians
anymore!

667
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:09,612
For all you know, I might
land behind bars!

668
01:15:09,748 --> 01:15:13,616
I'll have to find another way
to strangle Rana!

669
01:15:13,752 --> 01:15:17,586
Big deal! You're in power and
yet can't teach him a lesson!

670
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,485
Who else will?

671
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:26,754
There is someone...
who will fix Rana!

672
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:30,225
- Greetings.
- Greetings, yourself!

673
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,731
I'm not fond of
all those things.

674
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:42,468
Just have a cup oftea sent
for me... withoutsugar.

675
01:15:42,614 --> 01:15:44,707
- And tell Mr Terror that...
- Greetings.

676
01:15:45,951 --> 01:15:48,613
Welcome, Mr Mohanlal...

677
01:15:56,494 --> 01:15:58,394
Greetings, Mr Terror!

678
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:00,521
I, the Minister, offer you
my salutations!

679
01:16:10,475 --> 01:16:13,569
Tirlochan Tripathi?!
Alias... TT....?

680
01:16:13,712 --> 01:16:16,704
My name is not Tirlochan
Tripathi, alias TT...

681
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:41,299
I swear by my political
career, Mr TT...

682
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:47,639
I have for the first ever time
felt that I've found my match!

683
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:52,408
I thought I was the wiliest
ofthem all. But today...

684
01:16:52,584 --> 01:16:55,644
you've knocked me outcold!

685
01:16:55,787 --> 01:16:59,553
I feel like doing away with
all the idols at home...

686
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:01,419
and start worshipping you!

687
01:17:01,559 --> 01:17:03,857
This is politics for you.

688
01:17:03,928 --> 01:17:05,657
Besides, I'vejust changed
my attire.

689
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:08,221
Our intentions however
remain the same.

690
01:17:08,366 --> 01:17:11,767
We share a common goal.
As for scruples... we have none!

691
01:17:12,871 --> 01:17:18,104
You had one day sought Rana's
help to eliminate me.

692
01:17:18,243 --> 01:17:20,507
But you've come to me today
to teach Rana a lesson.

693
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:24,080
But it happens...
It's a partofthe game.

694
01:17:24,215 --> 01:17:27,412
Only when you stand up to
Goliath do you realise...

695
01:17:27,552 --> 01:17:30,487
that there are giants
in the world, too!

696
01:17:30,722 --> 01:17:34,749
Let bygones be bygones,
Mr TT... I mean, Mr Terror.

697
01:17:34,893 --> 01:17:38,021
But I want to know whether
you will help me or not.

698
01:17:38,196 --> 01:17:40,494
Ofcourse, I will!
By all means!

699
01:17:40,632 --> 01:17:43,100
But I will take the same
percentage ofspoils...

700
01:17:43,168 --> 01:17:45,500
that Rana sought from you.

701
01:17:45,637 --> 01:17:49,971
You dreamt ofbeing ChiefMinister
ofthis state. And you succeeded.

702
01:17:50,108 --> 01:17:54,135
But I dream ofbeing the
Prime Minister ofthis nation.

703
01:17:54,279 --> 01:17:56,247
That dream remains
yet unfulfilled.

704
01:17:56,314 --> 01:17:59,715
I need help from your party
to realise my dreams.

705
01:18:01,286 --> 01:18:03,516
- What does that mean?
- That which you wanted...

706
01:18:03,655 --> 01:18:05,384
Apolitical alliance!

707
01:18:05,523 --> 01:18:09,687
Should you to betray your party
in the forthcoming elections...

708
01:18:09,828 --> 01:18:12,524
we can capture power
at the Centre.

709
01:18:12,697 --> 01:18:16,656
Should I once be elected to
office for a 5-year term...

710
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:18,769
what is a Pawanghat
Power Project?!

711
01:18:18,837 --> 01:18:21,271
We can strip the nation with
financial scams...

712
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:24,068
and assure our next 7 generations
the greatest luxuries of life!

713
01:18:24,943 --> 01:18:29,403
To bring Rana on the streets...
I'd agree to anything you say!

714
01:18:29,547 --> 01:18:32,710
- Certainly.
-Just strangle the bastard...

715
01:18:32,851 --> 01:18:34,682
and kill him!

716
01:18:34,786 --> 01:18:38,745
You must do everything
with the utmost secrecy.

717
01:18:41,226 --> 01:18:46,425
Even the public has never been able
to guess my moves till this day.

718
01:18:46,564 --> 01:18:49,727
How the hell will they know
what I am up to?

719
01:18:49,868 --> 01:18:55,204
You can assume that Rana's
train oflife has derailed!

720
01:18:56,374 --> 01:18:57,966
Hey! Are you blind?

721
01:20:21,292 --> 01:20:23,123
Rush him to the hospital!
Quick!

722
01:20:26,598 --> 01:20:29,863
- Raja's met with an accident.
- What?! Which hospital is he in?

723
01:20:34,839 --> 01:20:36,500
Looks like Dr Ghayal
has arrived!

724
01:21:09,941 --> 01:21:10,930
No!

725
01:21:14,312 --> 01:21:16,143
- What's wrong, dear?
- No!

726
01:21:18,516 --> 01:21:23,317
He will not perform the operation
on Raja! Stop him, Daddy!

727
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:25,286
What nonsense are
you talking?

728
01:21:25,356 --> 01:21:27,756
Only Dr Ramprasad can
save your husband now!

729
01:21:27,926 --> 01:21:32,056
No! He won't save my husband!
He'll snatch him away from me!

730
01:21:32,196 --> 01:21:34,494
He'll extract revenge for his
brother's death from my husband!

731
01:21:34,632 --> 01:21:36,532
Stop him, Dad! Please stop him!

732
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:42,803
You will not be allowed to
operate on my husband! Never!

733
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:45,535
D'you hear me? You will not
perform the operation on him!

734
01:21:46,544 --> 01:21:47,875
Do you hear me?

735
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:50,208
Wait... stop!

736
01:21:52,684 --> 01:21:56,415
Commissioner! Please stop him,
for God's sake!

737
01:21:56,554 --> 01:21:59,546
He'll kill my husband!
He'll kill him!

738
01:21:59,757 --> 01:22:02,351
- He'll kill Raja. Stop him...
- Relax, dear.

739
01:22:30,788 --> 01:22:33,348
What's up, Siddiqui?
You look upset.

740
01:22:34,759 --> 01:22:37,387
There's only one problem,
Dr Ram.

741
01:22:37,528 --> 01:22:41,396
The patient's wife has refused
to sign the indemnity bond.

742
01:22:43,868 --> 01:22:44,926
She's crazy!

743
01:22:46,304 --> 01:22:48,602
She can't see the difference
between a killer and a doctor.

744
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,942
Go ahead and prepare
for the operation.

745
01:23:11,863 --> 01:23:15,560
Raja is my younger
brother, Dr Ram.

746
01:23:15,733 --> 01:23:17,564
Don't worry about the expenses.

747
01:23:17,635 --> 01:23:20,365
- But Raja must live.
- Mr Rana...

748
01:23:20,438 --> 01:23:23,999
Don't ever tell a doctor
his duties!

749
01:23:36,788 --> 01:23:39,689
There's an injured man lying
on your operation table.

750
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:41,815
Let him die.

751
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:45,988
Should you even attempt
to save him...

752
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:49,463
no power on earth can ever
be able to save you then!

753
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,934
Do you understand? I'll call
you again, in the next 30 minutes.

754
01:23:54,806 --> 01:23:56,797
I want to hear
ofRaja's death.

755
01:25:43,648 --> 01:25:45,616
Is Raja okay, doctor?

756
01:25:53,391 --> 01:25:55,382
Doctor?

757
01:26:05,136 --> 01:26:09,505
Had even the enemy to come to
the doctor as his patient...

758
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,631
the doctor would still
perform his duties.

759
01:26:12,276 --> 01:26:14,608
Adoctor saves lives...
never takes it!

760
01:26:18,783 --> 01:26:21,547
Come with me, Renu...
Come inside.

761
01:26:23,287 --> 01:26:27,883
Come and see the life on
your husband's face.

762
01:26:31,262 --> 01:26:32,251
Come in...

763
01:26:33,364 --> 01:26:34,422
There he is.

764
01:26:35,499 --> 01:26:40,436
In a little while, there will be
a smile on your husband's face.

765
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:45,800
To begin with, he
will want to...

766
01:27:19,143 --> 01:27:22,078
No! I left him herejust now...

767
01:27:28,653 --> 01:27:31,781
- Listen, Renu...
- You've snatched him from me!

768
01:27:34,558 --> 01:27:36,549
I knew you'd do that!

769
01:27:40,231 --> 01:27:43,894
You've killed my husband!
You've killed him!

770
01:27:45,903 --> 01:27:49,361
Hear me out, Renu...
Listen to me!

771
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:52,072
Listen...!

772
01:27:58,382 --> 01:28:00,077
What's wrong, dear?

773
01:28:01,085 --> 01:28:03,519
That which I feared
has happened!

774
01:28:03,788 --> 01:28:08,191
I had warned you... but you
wouldn't listen to me!

775
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:13,422
He has killed my husband!
He has killed Raja!

776
01:28:19,937 --> 01:28:24,738
Ifyou have indeed
killed Raja, doctor...

777
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:27,639
I will give you such
a dreadful death...

778
01:28:27,778 --> 01:28:29,769
that any doctor would
think several times...

779
01:28:29,914 --> 01:28:31,905
before doingsuch
a thing again!

780
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:36,747
No, Rana Tunga. No doctor would
deliberately kill his patient.

781
01:28:36,921 --> 01:28:41,483
But he has killed my husband!
Deliberately!

782
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:46,556
When I didn't even sign the
indemnity papers, Commissioner...

783
01:28:46,731 --> 01:28:48,665
why did he perform
the operation?!

784
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:50,824
Was itonly to kill my husband?!

785
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:54,565
- Is that true, Doctor...
- Commissioner!

786
01:28:56,574 --> 01:29:00,169
In her excitement, Renu had
refused to sign the papers.

787
01:29:01,178 --> 01:29:03,339
But, as a doctor...

788
01:29:03,481 --> 01:29:08,111
how could I desert my patient
on the operation table?

789
01:29:09,387 --> 01:29:11,753
I had to save his life and
I had very little time. So...

790
01:29:11,889 --> 01:29:13,516
He's lying!

791
01:29:13,824 --> 01:29:18,523
He has performed many operations
in that room.

792
01:29:18,763 --> 01:29:20,754
And none ofthe operations
have ever failed.

793
01:29:20,831 --> 01:29:22,765
Why then did this particular
operation fail...

794
01:29:25,536 --> 01:29:29,529
- Raja was alive!
- That's a lie! Afalsehood!

795
01:29:30,775 --> 01:29:35,610
I want you to register my
complaint, Commissioner!

796
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,278
I will testify against
this murder!

797
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:41,715
This man has broken
the law!

798
01:29:41,852 --> 01:29:46,186
So arrest him here and now!

799
01:29:48,793 --> 01:29:50,556
We must follow the law.

800
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:54,757
Take him in your
custody, Inspector.

801
01:30:09,513 --> 01:30:10,502
Thank you.

802
01:30:13,717 --> 01:30:18,313
There is something I've not been
able to figure out, Siddiqui.

803
01:30:18,456 --> 01:30:22,222
How did you finish Raja after
a successful operation?

804
01:30:24,528 --> 01:30:29,363
It's impossible for a patient to die,
once Dr Ram has operated on him.

805
01:30:30,534 --> 01:30:33,401
The operation was successful,
no doubt.

806
01:30:33,537 --> 01:30:37,871
But when Dr. Ram went out to give
Raja's wife the good news...

807
01:31:52,326 --> 01:31:56,592
I'm delighted with
your work, Siddiqui!

808
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:58,528
I'm so happy that...

809
01:31:58,666 --> 01:32:02,625
in a few days, I'll have you
made the dean ofthe hospital.

810
01:32:03,137 --> 01:32:04,331
Thank you, sir.

811
01:32:04,739 --> 01:32:09,403
But there is something
you must always remember.

812
01:32:09,577 --> 01:32:12,478
To save your precious
little life...

813
01:32:12,613 --> 01:32:18,984
make sure you keep this secret
buried in your heart.

814
01:32:19,253 --> 01:32:23,383
I will keep the secret till
I die, sir. But, Ram...

815
01:32:23,557 --> 01:32:25,821
Why are you worried
about that, my friend?

816
01:32:26,293 --> 01:32:27,885
Citingsecurity reasons...

817
01:32:28,029 --> 01:32:31,692
I'll have Ram sent tojail from
police custody, today itself.

818
01:32:33,234 --> 01:32:36,761
I'll make my next move
a little later.

819
01:33:16,143 --> 01:33:20,136
It's only ther innocents who cry
within the 4 walls of the prison.

820
01:33:20,281 --> 01:33:25,344
But neither can the law see
their tears... nor their plight.

821
01:33:30,091 --> 01:33:34,585
I used to be known as
Professor Nizamuddin Azad.

822
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:39,021
But I'm now reduced to being
a prisoner, bearing No. 52.

823
01:33:41,535 --> 01:33:45,631
I used to be a scientist in the labs
ofthe Indian Atomic Energy.

824
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:49,703
But I am now known as a
traitor ofthe nation.

825
01:33:51,545 --> 01:33:55,504
Mr Azad? Atraitor?

826
01:33:55,649 --> 01:33:59,517
Yes. Treason is what they
have accused me of.

827
01:34:00,621 --> 01:34:03,784
They accuse me ofpassing on
a formula ofthe missile...

828
01:34:03,858 --> 01:34:05,325
to foreign powers.

829
01:34:06,994 --> 01:34:11,556
Even my faith in God could
not prove my innocence.

830
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:15,766
Not even my clear conscience could
save me from this punishment.

831
01:34:16,537 --> 01:34:20,564
Like a devout Muslin, I used to
pray to the Almighty, 5 times a day.

832
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:26,874
But to make me confess
to the crime...

833
01:34:27,014 --> 01:34:32,475
the so-called patrons of
the law beat me up so badly...

834
01:34:32,653 --> 01:34:35,554
that iteven ruptured
the veins in my legs.

835
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:42,520
I am perhaps being punished for
a sin I must have committed...

836
01:34:42,663 --> 01:34:45,427
that I can't even bow to God
during my prayers.

837
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,091
I can't even kneel
before the Almighty!

838
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:53,201
Do you consider yourself
guilty then?

839
01:34:53,374 --> 01:34:56,036
It's demons who now rule
this land ofLord Rama.

840
01:34:57,378 --> 01:35:01,974
When those who rule the country
have pronounced me guilty...

841
01:35:02,116 --> 01:35:04,516
who will prove my innocence?

842
01:35:05,386 --> 01:35:09,482
The police, the courts and
the law and order...

843
01:35:09,623 --> 01:35:12,217
are all slaves to
their maneouvres.

844
01:35:12,393 --> 01:35:15,055
And look at yourself.

845
01:35:15,229 --> 01:35:18,323
You are a victim ofthe present
day's dirty politics, too.

846
01:35:18,465 --> 01:35:20,797
Not only you, even
your brother was...

847
01:35:22,403 --> 01:35:28,899
My brother? What happened to him?
What do you know about him?

848
01:35:29,109 --> 01:35:35,070
Your brother did not commitsuicide.
The poor boy was murdered.

849
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:43,384
Murdered? Who was it...?
Who killed my brother?

850
01:35:43,557 --> 01:35:47,357
It was the guardian oflaw...
Inspector Daanapani...

851
01:35:48,162 --> 01:35:52,861
who was decorated by the Government
last year, for his bravery.

852
01:35:53,567 --> 01:35:57,094
He came here with a couple of
constables that night, and...

853
01:36:14,054 --> 01:36:19,822
I saw it all happening...
I heard it all!

854
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:24,522
And yet, you quietly watched the
fun ofmy brother beingslaughtered?

855
01:36:24,732 --> 01:36:26,893
What else could
I have done?

856
01:36:27,735 --> 01:36:31,330
What could a cripple
behind bars do?

857
01:36:32,606 --> 01:36:37,339
Perhaps the Almighty made me
keep a silence then...

858
01:36:37,511 --> 01:36:41,641
so I could tell you
the whole truth.

859
01:36:45,886 --> 01:36:48,150
Look at the scrawl
on the wall, doctor.

860
01:36:48,289 --> 01:36:51,622
It's just not your
brother's handwriting.

861
01:37:00,601 --> 01:37:03,661
Here you are, sir...
The Jailer has sent it for you.

862
01:37:09,977 --> 01:37:11,672
Why do you drink?

863
01:37:14,915 --> 01:37:20,376
For support...
This is the only support I have.

864
01:37:20,587 --> 01:37:23,385
Ifalcohol could indeed
supportsomeone...

865
01:37:23,524 --> 01:37:26,721
no man would ever stagger
after drinking it.

866
01:37:29,396 --> 01:37:33,594
It's only those who stagger
that seek support.

867
01:37:34,935 --> 01:37:38,496
People lose their consciousness
when they are drunk...

868
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:41,437
and return to their senses,
once it wears off.

869
01:37:41,942 --> 01:37:44,570
You have a fire raging
in your heart...

870
01:37:44,712 --> 01:37:48,546
and yet douse itout with
this water?

871
01:37:48,682 --> 01:37:52,345
Alcohol makes a slave
outofman.

872
01:37:52,486 --> 01:37:57,287
And slaves are given to bowing
to their master's dictates...

873
01:37:57,358 --> 01:38:00,350
They can never fight back
like true soldiers.

874
01:38:03,797 --> 01:38:10,293
I was old and helpless... and
thus lost out to these traitors.

875
01:38:10,437 --> 01:38:12,530
I lost out to the
corrupt leaders!

876
01:38:12,673 --> 01:38:15,836
But you can accomplish
everything!

877
01:38:15,976 --> 01:38:18,308
You are even named
after Lord Rama!

878
01:38:18,379 --> 01:38:20,370
Why then are you so helpless?

879
01:38:20,447 --> 01:38:24,440
Pick up your weapons and
destroy the evilmen!

880
01:38:27,721 --> 01:38:32,624
Till today, you have granted life
to friends and foes alike.

881
01:38:33,394 --> 01:38:36,420
You have now to deliver
your enemies to death!

882
01:38:36,463 --> 01:38:39,455
You have now to destroy the
traitors ofthe country...

883
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,591
who intend to break up
the nation...

884
01:38:41,635 --> 01:38:44,126
and strip their motherland!

885
01:38:45,606 --> 01:38:47,597
You must now award
death to your enemies!

886
01:38:47,641 --> 01:38:50,132
Be then, the ''Angel ofDeath''

887
01:38:51,578 --> 01:38:53,341
The Angel ofDeath!

888
01:40:08,655 --> 01:40:11,488
Here you are, doctor. It's the
keys to the main-gate.

889
01:40:11,625 --> 01:40:14,719
Before the film is over...
make sure your escape.

890
01:40:14,862 --> 01:40:17,456
- But how...
- You have no time to think!

891
01:40:17,598 --> 01:40:20,624
The Almighty has Himself given
you this golden opportunity.

892
01:40:21,101 --> 01:40:23,228
Go on... Run away!

893
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:24,769
One moment, doctor.

894
01:40:26,773 --> 01:40:31,107
This is a charm from the
holy shrine at Ajmer.

895
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:35,745
God-willing, it will protect you
from all the dangers.

896
01:40:35,883 --> 01:40:37,316
Wear it around your neck.

897
01:40:43,891 --> 01:40:48,555
Anoble man like you can
never be a traitor.

898
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,895
May God protect you.

899
01:41:20,561 --> 01:41:22,028
Where the hell are you going?!

900
01:41:27,534 --> 01:41:29,525
Hold fort here...
I'll go and check downstairs.

901
01:41:47,187 --> 01:41:48,176
Freeze!

902
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:53,148
Mr Azaad!

903
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:59,162
Go away, Ram! Escape!

904
01:42:00,067 --> 01:42:03,468
Beware! Drop your guns...
or you're dead-meat!

905
01:42:03,837 --> 01:42:07,102
Go away, Ram! Go!

906
01:42:08,642 --> 01:42:11,543
I implore you in the name
ofthe God you worship!

907
01:42:11,812 --> 01:42:13,074
Escape!

908
01:42:14,147 --> 01:42:16,741
- Where are you going?
- Get in... Go on!

909
01:42:32,633 --> 01:42:36,262
Run away, doctor! Escape!

910
01:42:42,309 --> 01:42:47,508
Thanks a million, 
O Almighty...

911
01:42:48,582 --> 01:42:55,146
for letting a sinner bow to You
before he dies!

912
01:42:57,524 --> 01:43:04,623
I now come to You
with my head bowed.

913
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:27,347
What nonsense is that?
Has Dr Ram escaped from prison?!

914
01:43:28,188 --> 01:43:31,817
I must hear ofRam's death by
tomorrow morning, Daanapani.

915
01:43:31,958 --> 01:43:34,449
Engage him in an encounter anywhere
you find him andjust kill him!

916
01:44:06,593 --> 01:44:11,394
Amar! I'vejust heard iton TV
that Dr. Ram has escaped from...

917
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:16,769
What has stopped you from
completing your sentence, darling?

918
01:44:19,139 --> 01:44:21,607
You have a long life, Dr Ram.

919
01:44:21,742 --> 01:44:26,543
My wife was talking
about youjust now.

920
01:44:27,247 --> 01:44:31,115
You folks? Do you know me?

921
01:44:31,318 --> 01:44:33,309
How can we ever forget you?

922
01:44:33,954 --> 01:44:36,980
You had once saved my wife
from thejaws ofdeath!

923
01:44:37,124 --> 01:44:39,285
You had not even collected
your fees for the operation.

924
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:42,351
As far as we are concerned,
you are God Himself!

925
01:44:42,696 --> 01:44:45,426
You had once helped us, when
we were in difficulty.

926
01:44:45,565 --> 01:44:49,001
Ifwe don't help you out now,
who will?

927
01:44:49,169 --> 01:44:52,332
- Actually, Mr ...
- The name is Masrani.

928
01:44:52,472 --> 01:44:55,600
Yes, Mr Masrani...
I need a change ofclothes.

929
01:44:55,776 --> 01:44:59,371
Sure! Come along! I've got heaps
ofclothes in my studio!

930
01:44:59,513 --> 01:45:02,107
Acop's uniform,
a commando's outfit.

931
01:45:02,249 --> 01:45:04,217
You can even dress up
as a doctor.

932
01:45:04,317 --> 01:45:06,046
Help Yourself. Take anything
you want.

933
01:45:18,999 --> 01:45:19,988
This dress...?

934
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:31,106
- This camera, Mr Masrani...
- Keep it.

935
01:45:31,478 --> 01:45:33,810
Thank you. Thank you very much.

936
01:45:35,215 --> 01:45:37,479
Keep this money, too.
You might need it.

937
01:45:37,617 --> 01:45:39,551
Well, how can I...

938
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:43,617
Don't tink, doctor.
Just keep the money.

939
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:45,985
Keep it. You might need it.

940
01:45:48,361 --> 01:45:50,556
You're a very kind soul.

941
01:45:50,697 --> 01:45:52,631
You're also a great doctor.

942
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:57,368
Our nation needs doctors
like you.

943
01:45:57,537 --> 01:46:00,370
Take care ofyourself, doctor.

944
01:46:00,507 --> 01:46:02,498
The Lord will protect you.

945
01:46:08,882 --> 01:46:10,372
Wait there, Ram!

946
01:46:11,117 --> 01:46:12,641
Stop, I say!

947
01:52:13,079 --> 01:52:15,843
Here comes the swine
for the free-fun!

948
01:52:19,686 --> 01:52:20,948
Hey, Inspector!

949
01:52:22,822 --> 01:52:25,450
Don't go inside. Chand is
entertaining a customer.

950
01:52:25,592 --> 01:52:29,289
Just get on with your
tobacco-chewing, lady!

951
01:52:29,996 --> 01:52:31,987
And stop worrying about Chand!

952
01:52:32,899 --> 01:52:38,064
You know very well that whenever
I come to this brothel...

953
01:52:38,204 --> 01:52:41,298
I always have fun
with the girl!

954
01:52:41,374 --> 01:52:43,365
Who's in there?
Throw him out!

955
01:52:43,576 --> 01:52:46,306
He's paid for the fun!
He's not a bum, like you are!

956
01:52:46,446 --> 01:52:48,710
Do you guys have
no scruples?

957
01:52:48,748 --> 01:52:51,182
You want your bribes and
the girls, too? Get lost!

958
01:52:54,554 --> 01:52:56,215
Bloody whore!

959
01:52:58,491 --> 01:53:00,254
Will you lecture me?!

960
01:53:00,326 --> 01:53:03,853
But I'm not used to be
being lectured! Understand?

961
01:53:05,031 --> 01:53:08,398
Let me see who will stop me
from going inside!

962
01:53:08,568 --> 01:53:10,263
Who the hell's in there?

963
01:53:25,151 --> 01:53:26,083
You?!

964
01:53:31,124 --> 01:53:33,217
The guardians ofthe law...

965
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:36,123
are expected to protect the
helpless and the downtrodden.

966
01:53:36,296 --> 01:53:38,287
They are not supposed to
victimise them for their plight!

967
01:53:46,272 --> 01:53:48,297
Why did you kill my brother?
Tell me!

968
01:53:58,551 --> 01:54:00,485
Why did you kill him?
Speak up!

969
01:54:19,405 --> 01:54:23,068
- Speak up, or else...
- Hold it! I'll tell you!

970
01:54:23,209 --> 01:54:25,507
It was the minister, Mohanlal, who
plotted your brother's death...

971
01:54:25,645 --> 01:54:27,545
with the help ofRana.

972
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:30,205
They wanted him outoftheir way
to get on with their plans.

973
01:54:30,383 --> 01:54:33,511
Mohanlal then conspired with
Siddiqui to have Raja killed.

974
01:54:33,653 --> 01:54:36,645
He then had you implicated for
the murder... do you understand?

975
01:54:36,823 --> 01:54:40,156
They are the real killers!
I'mjust a pawn they've been using!

976
01:54:40,693 --> 01:54:44,720
Please let me go...
I have done nothing! I'm innocent!

977
01:54:44,897 --> 01:54:46,865
Forgive me! Let me go!

978
01:54:52,105 --> 01:54:57,042
Here you are, lady.
This will cover your losses.

979
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:17,057
Someone has fallen in
the burning oven, boss!

980
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:19,064
Forget it! Let's get the
hell outofhere!

981
01:56:24,397 --> 01:56:26,058
Listen to me first, Ram!

982
01:56:26,199 --> 01:56:28,531
State what you will, in the
presence ofthe people...

983
01:56:28,668 --> 01:56:33,196
to whom you have proved
that I am a murderer!

984
01:56:43,416 --> 01:56:46,544
This man is proofof
my innocence, MrJain!

985
01:56:49,155 --> 01:56:51,555
He is the real killer
ofRenu's husband!

986
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:58,363
Speak up, Siddiqui! Tell them...
who had killed Raja?

987
01:56:58,498 --> 01:57:00,898
Why had you killed him?
Speak up!

988
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:06,197
Speak up, Siddiqui!
Tell them!

989
01:57:17,517 --> 01:57:19,610
Wait, Siddiqui! Stop there!

990
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:14,362
You are a blot on the fair name
ofmedical practitioners!

991
01:58:14,874 --> 01:58:19,573
Why did you snuff out a life
on the operation table?

992
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:24,648
Why did you kill Raja?
Tell them the truth, or else...

993
01:58:31,724 --> 01:58:33,624
I'll tell them! I'll explain!

994
01:58:35,661 --> 01:58:39,062
Forgive me, Ram!
I have strayed!

995
01:58:40,199 --> 01:58:43,464
It was my greed
that killed Raja!

996
01:58:43,603 --> 01:58:45,935
But it was Mohanlal who plotted it!
Not me!

997
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:49,501
He wanted to teach Rana a lesson
by killing Raja...

998
01:58:49,575 --> 01:58:51,736
and wanted to implicate
you in the murder.

999
01:58:52,478 --> 01:58:55,072
How did you kill him?
Tell them!

1000
01:58:55,214 --> 01:58:57,205
Tell them how you killed him!

1001
01:58:58,251 --> 01:59:01,118
When you went out to convey the
success ofthe operation...

1002
01:59:01,153 --> 01:59:03,144
I switched offthe supply
ofoxygen.

1003
01:59:03,189 --> 01:59:04,816
I'm speaking the truth.

1004
01:59:04,957 --> 01:59:07,824
But forgive me, Ram...
Please grant me pardon!

1005
01:59:11,264 --> 01:59:16,497
Beg for forgiveness ofthe Lord...
Who you believe is Magnanimous.

1006
01:59:16,636 --> 01:59:19,104
He might grant you forgiveness.

1007
01:59:19,238 --> 01:59:22,139
But I will never forgive you!

1008
01:59:22,308 --> 01:59:25,334
- Don't, Ram...
- This is your punishment!

1009
01:59:26,445 --> 01:59:27,571
This is it!

1010
01:59:28,681 --> 01:59:29,807
This is it!

1011
01:59:31,017 --> 01:59:32,951
Go to hell!

1012
01:59:38,190 --> 01:59:41,523
It was my greed
that killed Raja!

1013
01:59:42,528 --> 01:59:44,587
But it was Mohanlal's idea!

1014
01:59:44,730 --> 01:59:49,224
He wanted to settle a score
with Rana and implicate you!

1015
01:59:49,402 --> 01:59:51,962
How did you kill him?
Tell them!

1016
01:59:52,138 --> 01:59:56,438
When you went out to convey the
success ofthe operation...

1017
01:59:56,575 --> 01:59:58,634
I cutoffthe
supply ofoxygen.

1018
02:00:05,584 --> 02:00:07,575
Have you seen the cassette?

1019
02:00:08,354 --> 02:00:10,754
Do you know who has really
killed your brother?

1020
02:00:11,457 --> 02:00:13,618
- Who is that?
- This is Ram speaking.

1021
02:00:15,094 --> 02:00:21,226
See that, Rana? The Mohanlal you
connived with, to kill my brother...

1022
02:00:21,367 --> 02:00:28,296
has snatched your brother from you,
to teach you a lesson!

1023
02:02:03,347 --> 02:02:07,374
Cursed is the father...

1024
02:02:07,551 --> 02:02:12,079
who cremates his
young and only son.

1025
02:02:13,357 --> 02:02:16,952
Arrest him! He is a convict
who has escaped from prison!

1026
02:02:17,094 --> 02:02:19,221
He's a killer!
Arrest him!

1027
02:02:19,396 --> 02:02:21,660
Whyjust arrest me?
Why not kill me instead!

1028
02:02:22,666 --> 02:02:24,657
Wipe me out in everyone's
presence!

1029
02:02:25,569 --> 02:02:28,538
Even burn me alive, if
I am indeed a killer!

1030
02:02:30,307 --> 02:02:35,142
But I have some questions to ask.

1031
02:02:35,312 --> 02:02:39,373
Who gave me the false label
ofa murderer? You did!

1032
02:02:42,319 --> 02:02:44,787
Who was it who falsely
implicated my brother...

1033
02:02:44,922 --> 02:02:48,551
and had him killed at Inspector
Daanapani's hands? You did!

1034
02:02:51,361 --> 02:02:55,593
Who got Dr Siddiqui to kill
Raja on the operation table...

1035
02:02:55,732 --> 02:02:58,394
and framed me for the murder?

1036
02:02:59,670 --> 02:03:02,639
You did, Mohanlal!
It was only you!

1037
02:03:03,473 --> 02:03:07,409
This man is lying! Damn it!
Why must you listen to his nonsense?

1038
02:03:07,577 --> 02:03:11,172
Kill him! I'll tell the press
that he attacked me!

1039
02:03:11,348 --> 02:03:14,181
Very well! Level another false
accusation at me and kill me!

1040
02:03:14,351 --> 02:03:16,046
Finish me off!

1041
02:03:16,186 --> 02:03:18,882
They must've ended many innocent
lives at your behest...

1042
02:03:19,022 --> 02:03:21,354
what difference will
another killing make?

1043
02:03:25,295 --> 02:03:26,785
What are you guys
waiting for?

1044
02:03:27,764 --> 02:03:30,426
Ifmen in uniform don't have the
courage to face the truth...

1045
02:03:30,567 --> 02:03:34,435
let it nor be trampled upon by
such falsehoods! Take itoff!

1046
02:03:34,571 --> 02:03:38,507
And strip these traitors who are
getting you to neglect your duties!

1047
02:03:40,577 --> 02:03:44,604
Ifwhat I say seems to be false...
shoot me!

1048
02:03:46,149 --> 02:03:48,310
Go ahead! Open fire!

1049
02:03:52,689 --> 02:03:54,156
Shoot, I say!

1050
02:03:56,259 --> 02:03:56,953
Shoot!

1051
02:03:57,094 --> 02:03:59,619
What are you waiting for?!
Fill him with lead!

1052
02:04:01,865 --> 02:04:03,457
No one will open fire.

1053
02:04:06,603 --> 02:04:10,505
Are you outofyour mind?
Kill the scoundrel!

1054
02:04:12,409 --> 02:04:14,400
Saw that, Mohanlal?

1055
02:04:15,178 --> 02:04:17,646
They now see the truth!

1056
02:04:19,549 --> 02:04:22,677
They have realised that a falsehood
is, after all, a falsehood!

1057
02:04:24,254 --> 02:04:25,846
As for the truth...

1058
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:43,100
Help! I've been set on fire!

1059
02:04:44,374 --> 02:04:46,569
Help! Save me!

1060
02:05:14,004 --> 02:05:15,665
Now let's discuss business.

1061
02:05:19,209 --> 02:05:20,676
Sit down, MrJohn.

1062
02:05:21,678 --> 02:05:23,771
So we have signed the MOU today.

1063
02:05:23,914 --> 02:05:26,474
And we will even make
it public tomorrow...

1064
02:05:26,616 --> 02:05:31,485
promising every village to be
lit up with electricity.

1065
02:05:31,621 --> 02:05:36,081
And the suckers that they are...
the masses will go mad withjoy!

1066
02:05:37,427 --> 02:05:41,761
How can you talk business on
a happy day like this, TT?

1067
02:05:42,632 --> 02:05:46,432
Where are the Indian dancers you've
called in for our entertainment?

1068
02:05:47,604 --> 02:05:50,232
I haven't come here to see
the Indian dancers perform.

1069
02:05:50,373 --> 02:05:53,069
I have come to rob
the people ofIndia!

1070
02:05:53,243 --> 02:05:57,179
Show me something then...
that will steal my heart!

1071
02:05:57,948 --> 02:05:59,381
Certainly, MrJohn.

1072
02:05:59,683 --> 02:06:03,517
We'll now present to you a fusion
ofthe East and the West.

1073
02:06:03,653 --> 02:06:08,681
You must know how the Indians are
obsessed with foreign dances!

1074
02:12:09,085 --> 02:12:11,576
Move aside! Outofour way!

1075
02:12:13,957 --> 02:12:16,357
I'm sure it was Ram!

1076
02:12:16,526 --> 02:12:19,518
He's hidingsomewhere around!
Find him and shoot him down!

1077
02:12:19,662 --> 02:12:23,530
Rest assured, Mr TT, I have made
very good security arrangements.

1078
02:12:23,666 --> 02:12:26,464
There will be no problem
in your programme.

1079
02:12:26,603 --> 02:12:29,470
The police will now smell Ram
miles away...

1080
02:12:29,606 --> 02:12:32,074
and he will no longer
only be arrested.

1081
02:12:32,208 --> 02:12:34,540
He will be shot at sight!

1082
02:12:34,711 --> 02:12:39,375
I have cherished only one
dream in life, Commissioner.

1083
02:12:39,516 --> 02:12:43,919
I'd do anything, if my dreams
are shattered.

1084
02:12:44,053 --> 02:12:48,422
Your life and your career depend
on the success ofmy function.

1085
02:12:48,558 --> 02:12:52,460
Should anything untoward happen
there, ask your family...

1086
02:12:52,595 --> 02:12:55,428
to have a day found to
mourn your death!

1087
02:12:56,533 --> 02:13:00,333
On this auspicious day, we will
show you some rare glimpses...

1088
02:13:00,470 --> 02:13:04,429
ofthe services our revered leader
has rendered to society.

1089
02:13:05,742 --> 02:13:07,801
It was 50 years ago that...

1090
02:13:07,944 --> 02:13:12,972
a child was born in a small village
ofUttar Pradesh called Pirana.

1091
02:13:13,149 --> 02:13:18,485
Born in a Brahmin family, the
child was called Tirlochan.

1092
02:13:18,621 --> 02:13:21,351
Even in his childhood, the all
pervading poverty...

1093
02:13:21,491 --> 02:13:25,052
made such an indelible
impression on his mind...

1094
02:13:25,194 --> 02:13:28,163
that the mere sight ofpoverty
moved the child to tears.

1095
02:13:28,331 --> 02:13:30,925
Treating poverty as the
No. 1 enemy ofthe masses...

1096
02:13:31,067 --> 02:13:33,194
the boy dedicated himself
to the service ofsociety.

1097
02:13:33,570 --> 02:13:36,505
One who found time for everyone
in difficulty...

1098
02:13:36,539 --> 02:13:39,030
the youth became the Village
Chiefvery early in life.

1099
02:13:39,208 --> 02:13:42,234
That marked a new era for
the village.

1100
02:13:42,378 --> 02:13:46,576
But Tirlochan Tripathi had the
problems ofthe country at heart.

1101
02:13:46,716 --> 02:13:50,447
How then could he be content with
merely improving his village?

1102
02:13:50,587 --> 02:13:53,215
To improve the working conditions
ofthe labour in the country...

1103
02:13:53,356 --> 02:13:55,381
he formed the Shramik Dal...

1104
02:13:55,458 --> 02:13:59,360
and pursued his one-point programme;
the eradication ofpoverty.

1105
02:14:03,499 --> 02:14:08,527
That's enough. You have given
him enough ofapplause.

1106
02:14:13,209 --> 02:14:14,767
How did he get on screen?!

1107
02:14:16,179 --> 02:14:18,238
The conjuror's act
now comes to an end!

1108
02:14:18,414 --> 02:14:19,472
Cut itout!

1109
02:14:19,549 --> 02:14:21,813
Have you heard then,
the heart-rending tales...

1110
02:14:21,951 --> 02:14:23,942
ofhis service to the
nation and society?

1111
02:14:25,321 --> 02:14:28,654
Now listen to some of
this gentleman's deeds.

1112
02:14:29,826 --> 02:14:34,490
It's true that great leaders
are not born very often.

1113
02:14:34,631 --> 02:14:40,433
But devils are now mushrooming
everywhere in the country.

1114
02:14:40,570 --> 02:14:45,132
Ademon ofthis nature was born
on the sacred land ofIndia...

1115
02:14:45,274 --> 02:14:47,367
some 5 decades ago.

1116
02:14:49,278 --> 02:14:58,118
It's Mr Tirlochan Tripathi
alias T.T., and in truth...

1117
02:15:01,624 --> 02:15:04,115
- Switch itoff!
- What's wrong with this?!

1118
02:15:04,293 --> 02:15:06,124
- Cut itout!
- I'm doing my best, sir!

1119
02:15:06,262 --> 02:15:07,889
It's ofno use, T.T.

1120
02:15:08,331 --> 02:15:10,390
This is not a door on the
poverty-stricken masses ...

1121
02:15:10,533 --> 02:15:12,694
that will shut at
your behest.

1122
02:15:13,603 --> 02:15:17,039
This is the voice ofthe Indian who
has awoken from his slumber...

1123
02:15:17,173 --> 02:15:20,472
which will be silenced only after
you have accounted for your sins!

1124
02:15:21,277 --> 02:15:26,510
I hold the remote to
this Direct Channel!

1125
02:15:27,116 --> 02:15:29,584
You have shown them the
glorified side to you.

1126
02:15:29,752 --> 02:15:31,982
I will not reveal to them
what you really are!

1127
02:15:32,121 --> 02:15:34,351
The permission for the Pawanghat
Power Project..

1128
02:15:34,490 --> 02:15:36,685
has been finalised.

1129
02:15:36,826 --> 02:15:40,125
To sign the agreement, therefore,
their Managing Director, MrJohn...

1130
02:15:40,296 --> 02:15:43,322
will be arriving here
tomorrow.

1131
02:15:43,466 --> 02:15:46,230
- But why would you need me?
- I do need you.

1132
02:15:46,369 --> 02:15:50,237
We must evict the tribals who
have been occupying that land.

1133
02:15:50,373 --> 02:15:53,069
And only you can
accomplish that.

1134
02:15:53,209 --> 02:15:57,043
I also know that you didn't see
eye to eye with Mr Mohanlal...

1135
02:15:57,180 --> 02:16:00,240
over the issue ofsharing
the moolah.

1136
02:16:00,383 --> 02:16:04,649
But rest assured. I have discussed
the issue with the new minister...

1137
02:16:04,787 --> 02:16:09,121
and we will now share
everything 50, 50!

1138
02:16:09,726 --> 02:16:14,254
You could say that we,
the crooked politicians...

1139
02:16:14,397 --> 02:16:18,026
will keep robbing the stupid masses
ofIndia for all times to come!

1140
02:16:21,938 --> 02:16:23,405
Please sit down, MrJohn.

1141
02:16:24,273 --> 02:16:26,673
At last, the agreement has
been signed today.

1142
02:16:26,809 --> 02:16:29,573
And we will even present it
before the public soon...

1143
02:16:29,645 --> 02:16:31,272
with the promise that...

1144
02:16:31,347 --> 02:16:34,475
all our villages will be
lit up with electric supply...

1145
02:16:34,550 --> 02:16:39,351
and our foolish masses will go
mad withjoy with the news!

1146
02:16:40,156 --> 02:16:45,025
Afew days later, we'll slightly
hike the tariff ofthe power-supply.

1147
02:16:45,161 --> 02:16:48,961
We have paid you guys a
hefty kickback, haven't we?

1148
02:16:49,232 --> 02:16:52,224
Why raise itslightly?
Raise it to any level you wish!

1149
02:16:52,368 --> 02:16:55,201
The public in our nation
is used to price hikes!

1150
02:16:55,605 --> 02:16:59,598
The idiots will kick up a fuss...
but later cool down.

1151
02:17:05,047 --> 02:17:10,485
Give him an ovation! Celebrate the
doom that stares you in the face!

1152
02:17:11,387 --> 02:17:13,651
Coin some slogans to eulogise
this cheat's dubious ways!

1153
02:17:16,292 --> 02:17:20,353
For how long will you keep
clapping away, like eunuchs?

1154
02:17:20,530 --> 02:17:23,192
Arrest this killer, inspector!

1155
02:17:23,332 --> 02:17:25,323
He is a fugitive who has
escaped from the prison!

1156
02:17:25,868 --> 02:17:27,392
Don't you dare, inspector!

1157
02:17:27,470 --> 02:17:31,133
The man who can harm Ram
is yet to be born!

1158
02:17:31,274 --> 02:17:33,640
And you are cheats... thugs!

1159
02:17:33,876 --> 02:17:37,073
Even the mighty demon-king
had lost out to Ram's might.

1160
02:17:37,213 --> 02:17:40,478
Should you arrest Ram,
Inspector...

1161
02:17:40,616 --> 02:17:42,447
there will be a blood-bath!

1162
02:17:42,485 --> 02:17:45,215
There will be a battle between
the public and the police!

1163
02:17:45,288 --> 02:17:48,621
Yes! We will fight itout
to protect him!

1164
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:55,120
Relax, Inspector...
Let him speak!

1165
02:17:55,264 --> 02:17:58,427
The masses know what I am!

1166
02:17:58,568 --> 02:18:01,435
This is a ploy ofthe
opposition to defame me...

1167
02:18:01,571 --> 02:18:03,835
and this man is their stooge!

1168
02:18:05,608 --> 02:18:10,545
A crow will remain a crow, even
if it visits the holy pilgrimages.

1169
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:17,319
You're a man who'd even
sell his mother for money!

1170
02:18:17,687 --> 02:18:21,145
You use politics for a crutch
and sacrifice anyone...

1171
02:18:21,290 --> 02:18:25,158
to achieve your own
selfish ends.

1172
02:18:25,328 --> 02:18:29,389
I am not the only one you have
used as a pawn in your game...

1173
02:18:29,532 --> 02:18:33,525
you have also trapped the masses
ofthe country in your dirty trap!

1174
02:18:34,203 --> 02:18:37,832
I could have killed you with the
foreign swine the other day.

1175
02:18:38,741 --> 02:18:42,108
I could have rendered your
unholy entity to dust!

1176
02:18:42,245 --> 02:18:44,543
But I wanted to expose you
to the public...

1177
02:18:44,614 --> 02:18:47,606
and hand you over to them!

1178
02:18:48,251 --> 02:18:53,917
Which is why you're still alive;
a burden on the face ofearth!

1179
02:18:54,824 --> 02:18:57,019
But I have achieved
my goal today.

1180
02:18:58,361 --> 02:19:01,660
Neither will the law decide
your case, nor the law!

1181
02:19:03,199 --> 02:19:07,192
God has entrusted your
case to the public!

1182
02:19:07,370 --> 02:19:09,099
The people will now realise...

1183
02:19:09,238 --> 02:19:12,071
how you have robbed the nation
with the thugs!

1184
02:19:13,609 --> 02:19:16,635
They'll know how you've made
a shroud outofthe uniform...

1185
02:19:16,779 --> 02:19:18,747
the police wear!

1186
02:19:18,881 --> 02:19:24,649
They will realise how you have
made a whore outofjustice!

1187
02:19:25,087 --> 02:19:31,515
How you have fooled the poor,
got them to vote for you...

1188
02:19:31,661 --> 02:19:33,993
and won election after election.

1189
02:19:34,130 --> 02:19:38,396
And once you won the elections,
you deserted the masses...

1190
02:19:38,534 --> 02:19:40,661
as ifthey were unwed mothers!

1191
02:19:41,671 --> 02:19:45,869
People who sweat and toil
for the country...

1192
02:19:46,142 --> 02:19:49,077
find it difficult to even
feed their children.

1193
02:19:49,211 --> 02:19:52,271
And you sit down to decide
on the nation's destiny...!

1194
02:19:52,415 --> 02:19:55,350
blowing up millions ofRupees in
the weddings ofyour children!

1195
02:19:55,484 --> 02:19:57,145
Where does the
money come from?

1196
02:19:58,688 --> 02:20:04,126
You poison the masses' ears, in
the name ofreligion and community...

1197
02:20:04,293 --> 02:20:08,024
and sit in your ivory towers
to watch the fun of...

1198
02:20:08,164 --> 02:20:10,632
the blood-bath that
the public gets into!

1199
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:15,296
Why hasn't a political leader
ever been killed in the riots?

1200
02:20:15,438 --> 02:20:17,372
Why have their houses
never been set on fire?

1201
02:20:17,506 --> 02:20:20,634
Why were they never struck by
the bullets ofthe police?

1202
02:20:21,544 --> 02:20:22,568
Never!

1203
02:20:22,678 --> 02:20:24,236
Their bullets always found...

1204
02:20:24,313 --> 02:20:27,305
the poor innocent Indian who
had done nothing!

1205
02:20:28,184 --> 02:20:29,583
Do you hear me?

1206
02:20:29,618 --> 02:20:31,609
Or do you still prefer
to play deaf?

1207
02:20:32,555 --> 02:20:36,457
Do you see how this man has
been hoodwinking you? 

1208
02:20:36,592 --> 02:20:40,551
Awaken! Awaken now from
your lethargic stupor!

1209
02:20:41,664 --> 02:20:44,326
For how long will you silently
put up with their atrocities?

1210
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:47,794
Our forefathers had once got
us freedom from slavery.

1211
02:20:47,937 --> 02:20:50,337
Will we be pushed back
into slavery again?

1212
02:20:50,473 --> 02:20:55,137
Must we entrust the reins ofthe
nation to such dishonest leaders...

1213
02:20:55,277 --> 02:20:59,111
who wear stain-proofclothes,
drive bullet-proofcars...

1214
02:20:59,248 --> 02:21:02,342
possess noise-proofears and
have no sense ofshame or guilt?

1215
02:21:03,419 --> 02:21:05,614
Speak up! Answer me!

1216
02:21:09,225 --> 02:21:10,749
Bloody scoundrel!

1217
02:21:25,241 --> 02:21:28,699
Run away! We're going
to be lynched today!

1218
02:21:32,314 --> 02:21:34,305
Beat her up!
She's one ofthe crooks!

1219
02:21:35,184 --> 02:21:38,312
She's a thief, too!
Give her a thrashing!

1220
02:22:33,576 --> 02:22:35,874
TT?! Many happy returns
ofthe day!

1221
02:22:36,045 --> 02:22:38,172
To hell with my birthday!

1222
02:22:38,314 --> 02:22:40,305
Start preparing
for your funeral!

1223
02:22:41,117 --> 02:22:43,278
Listen carefully to
what I say...!

1224
02:23:22,491 --> 02:23:24,482
Don't anyone ofyou
get any closer!

1225
02:23:40,509 --> 02:23:42,500
Don't anyone dare
get closer!

1226
02:23:43,112 --> 02:23:46,570
Or else, I'll mow you down
here in this graveyard!

1227
02:23:47,383 --> 02:23:51,183
I'll have you cremated without
a funeral pyre!

1228
02:23:54,223 --> 02:23:59,559
The terror ofyour guns cannot
silence the masses today!

1229
02:24:00,663 --> 02:24:02,654
It's you guys who will
have a funeral today!

1230
02:24:03,732 --> 02:24:07,463
And the people will spiton you,
to stoke the fires!

1231
02:24:28,691 --> 02:24:30,625
Stop there, I say!

1232
02:24:33,429 --> 02:24:35,420
Don't you come closer, Ram!

1233
02:24:36,632 --> 02:24:38,031
Stop there, Ram!

1234
02:25:25,547 --> 02:25:28,345
What are you up to?
The slugs have all fallen down!

1235
02:25:28,484 --> 02:25:31,009
- Where are they?
- Let me load it for you!

1236
02:25:35,090 --> 02:25:36,614
Now see how it works!

1237
02:26:07,523 --> 02:26:11,289
Here's TT, friends!
Kill him! Beat him up!

1238
02:26:31,213 --> 02:26:32,510
No! Don't...!

1239
02:26:33,949 --> 02:26:34,938
No...!

1240
02:27:25,134 --> 02:27:29,070
Leaders like you don't deserve
to take birth in this country!

1241
02:27:33,475 --> 02:27:39,744
I will ask you to account for the
miseries ofevery Indian today!

1242
02:27:46,555 --> 02:27:49,547
It's dishonest leaders like you
who have set a fire...

1243
02:27:49,691 --> 02:27:52,524
ofhatred raging in the country!

1244
02:27:52,661 --> 02:27:57,360
I will today putout the fire
with your blood!

1245
02:28:04,139 --> 02:28:06,801
What are you waiting for?
Let's rush him to the hospital!

1246
02:28:06,942 --> 02:28:11,242
No, Masrani... this is enough!
I'm through now!

1247
02:28:13,449 --> 02:28:15,610
My time is up.

1248
02:28:17,453 --> 02:28:20,183
But you'll die, if we don't
rush you to the hospital!

1249
02:28:20,622 --> 02:28:21,714
No, Masrani.

1250
02:28:24,193 --> 02:28:26,718
I'm not sorry at my death.

1251
02:28:27,563 --> 02:28:29,622
In fact, I'm a very happy man.

1252
02:28:31,133 --> 02:28:37,732
My death will usher in a revolution
amongst the people ofthis country!

1253
02:28:41,343 --> 02:28:46,246
May one die a death
the world remembers!

1254
02:28:47,816 --> 02:28:53,083
Or else, everybody else is
born in the same manner...

1255
02:28:53,255 --> 02:28:55,587
to die some day.
