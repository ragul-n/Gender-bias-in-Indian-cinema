1
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:04,228
You are a very kind
hearted human being.

2
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:09,965
You sacrifice your desires for
the happiness of other people.

3
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:15,644
You remain in pain in order to
bring a smile on a stranger's lips.

4
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:19,644
But very soon all your miseries
will reach an end.

5
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:26,988
You are about to find a treasure,
in dollars or pounds or rupees...

6
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,997
But you are going to be
a multimillionaire...

7
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:36,263
...just like Bill Gates soon

8
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:44,341
Bill Gate! Hey Nandu... Bill Gate!

9
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:46,171
Do you know who he is?

10
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:49,180
Of course I know Bill Gate!

11
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,748
It's the one next to India Gate

12
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:54,019
You moron! He's a man!

13
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:58,349
Worth millions and millions
of dollars!

14
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,125
So?

15
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,356
You'll become just like him

16
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,295
You're about to receive
a huge treasure!

17
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:08,959
Is that what this said?

18
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:12,471
Yeah... That too in English.
Does anybody lie in English?

19
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:15,574
Let me hear it again

20
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:43,332
My goblin refuses to budge

21
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:48,335
Till it gets its milk fudge

22
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:53,338
My goblin refuses to budge

23
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,745
Till it gets its milk fudge

24
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:59,281
My weary goblin's all drained

25
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:06,115
All day on one leg, looks pained

26
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:39,150
The fox came and bit my goblin

27
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:47,156
The fox came and bit my goblin then
licked grandpa's bowl clean

28
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:54,497
the bowl was lying on Grandpa's cot

29
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,940
Grandpa's cot gone to rot

30
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:15,622
Is the stick mightier than grandpa?

31
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:24,135
Is the stick mightier than grandpa?

32
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:49,651
Show me the money!
Show me the money!

33
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:02,199
The frog croaks the truth clean

34
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:05,267
The barber's moustache
has turned green

35
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:12,547
The frog croaks the truth clean

36
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:15,281
The barber's moustache
has turned green

37
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:18,119
Wheat grows on the cow's back

38
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:30,964
Whose moustache did the cow attack?

39
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:41,143
Is the moustache mightier
than the barber?

40
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,926
Rajaram! Shutters down!

41
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,602
My goblin refuses to budge

42
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,432
Till it gets its milk fudge

43
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:32,556
Nandu uncle! Donation time!!

44
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,968
Nandu has gone to the
city for purchases.

45
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,970
Who are you?

46
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:45,304
I am his aunt

47
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:49,972
Uncle's aunt?

48
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,312
But Uncle never had an uncle
in the first place...

49
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:04,425
He had a distant uncle...
I am that distant aunt.

50
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:07,924
Tell Uncle that he is invited to...

51
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,935
Tikku's place for the
ceremonial prayers...

52
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,265
He should definitely come

53
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,271
Sure thing! He will
definitely come...

54
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,272
And 'distant aunt'...
you must also come

55
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:21,272
For sure I will.

56
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:51,470
My goblin refuses to budge

57
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,637
Till it gets its milk fudge

58
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:07,253
Goddess! Hail to your glory!

59
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:12,927
O Goddess! Shower your blessings
on us mortals!

60
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:18,102
Goddess! You are benevolent to
everyone and you bless everyone!

61
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:23,267
Show us your glory!
Save us, Goddess.

62
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:28,210
Bless us, O Goddess.

63
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:33,014
Bless us, O Goddess.

64
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:37,622
Bless us, O Goddess.

65
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:57,466
You are our only means and end.

66
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,146
Help us reach our destination.

67
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:07,315
Your light is mystical.

68
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:10,988
Show us the way.

69
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:12,449
What are you eating?

70
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:13,987
No... nothing

71
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,488
Then what are you hiding?

72
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:16,653
Nothing

73
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,003
I thought you said it
had all finished...

74
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,668
You runt!

75
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:36,515
Wait till I get you!

76
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:42,519
Stop Tiku!

77
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:05,969
Come baby... come to papa
and take the binoculars!

78
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:07,303
Come and get it.

79
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,642
I'll get you, you rascal!

80
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:10,979
Come on! Take your binoculars!

81
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:12,175
You want your binoculars, right?

82
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:14,979
Come on and get it...

83
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:17,454
Who the hell...?

84
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:48,009
The wretch has borrowed
164 rupees worth of...

85
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,021
biscuits and toffees from the shop

86
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,184
First he said 'I don't have money
but I can give you some pickle'

87
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,353
I agreed

88
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:00,688
I tasted the pickle.
It was mind blowing!

89
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,032
Then he said he he'd
deliver it bit by bit

90
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:05,968
I agreed to that too

91
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:09,234
Then one fine day he announces
that he's run out of pickle

92
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,967
When a fresh lot is made in
spring I will bring some more

93
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:13,972
I agreed to that as well

94
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:16,972
But last night I caught
him red handed.

95
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:20,251
Now I don't want his
damn pickle anymore

96
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,650
Get 164 rupees and
free the binoculars

97
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:24,986
But uncle! The binoculars
are very expensive...

98
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:27,117
So what?

99
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:28,990
If his father doesn't pay up, I'll
get the money from my mother...

100
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:30,586
Fair enough

101
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,992
Now give the binoculars back

102
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,493
Now give the binoculars
back (mocking)

103
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,334
'First my money, otherwise no honey'

104
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:45,000
Everyone knows he loves
giving credit...

105
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:47,342
so that he can swindle you later.

106
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:48,607
Moron!

107
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:56,010
If you're so concerned, hand
me your lucky charm...

108
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,219
and you can have the
binoculars back.

109
00:13:04,697 --> 00:13:06,961
Damn! There goes the milk!

110
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,635
I'll slice off your ears and
stick them on your bottom

111
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:11,965
Nandu! Binoculars!

112
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:15,134
Go catch him! Get it back!

113
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:37,489
Come and get me now!

114
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,947
What if we give you extra
half litre of...

115
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,954
milk daily till his debt gets over?

116
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:13,296
Fine. Till then, I'll
keep the binoculars

117
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,293
I'm not giving it!

118
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:16,968
I'm not giving it! (mocking)

119
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,470
Naughty Naughty!

120
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:34,650
Neelu! Gauri! Don't go far away!

121
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,153
I'll hit you if you do.

122
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:05,250
Hey Nandu!

123
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,153
Whites don't even grant
death for free.

124
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:17,986
How come they gifted such
a grand umbrella?

125
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:23,997
Wait... I'll get some water.

126
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,174
Let it be, mum! It's their umbrella

127
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,671
lts upto them to gift
it if they like

128
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,014
Why are you getting so worked up?

129
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:57,633
Where is your lucky charm?

130
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,962
Mum... pass me the curry.

131
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,301
Where is the locket?

132
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:05,570
Good heavens!!

133
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:08,369
You sold the charm to
get that umbrella!

134
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:12,142
You know how precious
that locket was?

135
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:13,509
Come off it mum...
She's just a child.

136
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:16,483
Anyway, the bear claw didn't
drop out of heaven...

137
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:17,984
I was the one who got it...

138
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:19,115
I'll get another one

139
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:20,249
She'll go sell it again

140
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:25,662
No... she won't

141
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:29,326
If you pamper her at this rate

142
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:34,002
you'll have trouble finding
a groom for her...

143
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:37,008
once she grows up

144
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:43,509
Cheer up now. We'll find
you a nice locket

145
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,474
and an even nicer groom

146
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,625
Leelavati!

147
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:02,291
Lily!

148
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,142
Sorry!

149
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,506
Rajaram! Get tea for the tourists!

150
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:51,682
So, your English pundit's
back in business?

151
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:29,985
Something for you.

152
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,324
Stan, let's go. - I can't. I can't
find my jacket! It's missing!

153
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:40,988
Forget it. Come on, now!

154
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:42,499
Just a minute.

155
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:44,658
Kid, have you seen my jacket?

156
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:47,494
A jacket. Have you seen my jacket?

157
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,608
Pattice... 5 rupees.

158
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:56,012
No, thank you.

159
00:23:58,684 --> 00:23:59,946
'No thank you! '

160
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:06,947
Try this new flavour

161
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:10,286
I don't want it

162
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:12,555
Why?

163
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:16,963
'Borrowing on credit destroys love'

164
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,700
Is that what's written?

165
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:34,176
Come here dear!

166
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,317
Just read out what's written

167
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:40,388
'Borrowing on credit spreads love'

168
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:46,325
How far will you run, you wretch!
Wait till you come back!

169
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:05,014
Now what pittance will I earn
from you, Biniya darling!

170
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:12,118
You can have the candy on the house

171
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:20,458
Neat umbrella!

172
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:21,624
Hmmm

173
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:31,503
The sun must also feel
cool under that?

174
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,979
But isn't it a size
too large for you?

175
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:46,384
Everyday for the next six months,
2 toffees and 2 biscuits...

176
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:50,985
One potato pie with carrot
pickle every week...

177
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:53,588
Sparklers for diwali,
spray gun for holi...

178
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:56,498
Half ounce of ripe berries,
one packet of jujubes

179
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:58,934
and to top it all... ten raw mangoes

180
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:01,097
Do we have a deal?

181
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:05,201
No thanks

182
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:19,613
But what will you do with
such an oversized umbrella?

183
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,290
I'll make pickle out of it

184
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:30,298
Chaudhary, sure the
colour won't run?

185
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,967
Don't you Chaudhary me dammit!
I'm your uncle!

186
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,032
Give me some tobacco

187
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,704
Okay dear Uncle, the
colour wont run, no?

188
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,037
You rascal!

189
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:46,141
Sorry, uncle... here's the tobacco

190
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:51,145
Sure the colour won't run, uncle?

191
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:56,988
The skin may come off your bones, but
the colour won't run off the cloth

192
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:08,666
What took you so long, moron?

193
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:11,532
Where did you swipe
this fancy coat from?

194
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:14,937
What am I asking?

195
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:24,121
125 rupees

196
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:25,548
You call this an umbrella?

197
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:27,954
No, I think it's a radio

198
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:31,959
No, what I mean is its not the
kind of umbrella I want...

199
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,296
Pray, what kind of umbrella
do you want?

200
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:44,135
This exquisite... multicoloured
beauty...

201
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:52,978
as if the sky has been pierced by
an exquisite spear... by chance

202
00:27:53,051 --> 00:28:00,423
Wait a minute...

203
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,260
Is this what you are looking for?

204
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,104
You bet! This is exactly what I want

205
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:16,934
This is a Japanese make...

206
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:18,943
We'll have to bring
it in from Delhi...

207
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:21,605
It will take about a week

208
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:23,943
But I'll need the entire
amount in advance

209
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:26,109
How much?

210
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:30,219
Twenty five hundred

211
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:53,141
Here you go... ten 50 rupee notes

212
00:28:54,713 --> 00:28:59,514
Not ten... it's going to cost
you fifty 50 rupee notes!

213
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:24,439
Hello! Stop the bus.

214
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:56,131
Saw an umbrella just like
yours in the city

215
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,472
Here, got these for you

216
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:10,143
The price was 150 rupees... I
thought, Nandu, you have gone mad?

217
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:13,981
If you want to splurge,
splurge on Biniya

218
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:22,490
So, I decided that I will give
you 5 ten rupee notes...

219
00:30:29,574 --> 00:30:30,666
in exchange for the umbrella.

220
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,008
That way both of us will
be happy! What say?

221
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,011
This umbrella will be mine.

222
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:40,679
Here. Take this money.

223
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:44,348
Take your balloon along.

224
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:03,974
The just conducted presidential...

225
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:07,978
...elections in the US have...

226
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:12,642
...had three major parts.

227
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:21,986
17, 18, 19...

228
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,326
Between Bush and Shariff
proved the point.

229
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:35,495
Mummy!

230
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:58,026
This huge a snake...

231
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:08,303
Frankly speaking, I almost
lost my underpants.

232
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:13,141
And then charged Biniya,
brandishing her umbrella

233
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:19,316
lmmediately, the snake
fled like the devil

234
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:22,476
must have caught its breath
only after reaching the den

235
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:28,515
Champ... Is it a real umbrella
or Joan of Arc?

236
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:47,178
My heavenly blue umbrella

237
00:32:56,221 --> 00:33:01,682
My heavenly blue umbrella my
flight to the skies umbrella

238
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,621
My swinging wayward umbrella

239
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:14,236
it flies now, runs then
runs now, jogs then

240
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:16,638
My whimsical playful umbrella

241
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:47,333
Stole a piece of heaven
dressed it up in wood

242
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:52,340
I now clasp the sky in my hands

243
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:59,279
Look at me preen and stroll
like a delicate Madame's loll

244
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:05,117
The envy of all and sundry

245
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,952
A peg now, woof! A stick then...

246
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:11,291
A stick now, woof! A wand then

247
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:17,302
Always upto some mischief,
my impish umbrella

248
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:34,040
Uncle, of what use is that
oversized umbrella?

249
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:39,646
Of what use is a rainbow
in the sky?

250
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:47,055
Of what use is a paper boat
floating in the water?

251
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:53,003
Of what use is watching the
sun set behind the hills?

252
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,106
Of what use is a good for
nothing wretch like you?

253
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:05,282
One cannot put a price
on peace for the soul...

254
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:14,953
That umbrella and me are soulmates
from some previous birth...

255
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:27,303
Have known the rains forever

256
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:33,634
Have longed for the waters forever

257
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:40,982
Seems like a union of long past

258
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:48,158
It might want to fly again
go meet the skies again

259
00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:52,322
Oh it's innocent to
the ways of the world

260
00:35:53,998 --> 00:36:00,927
It drowns now, swims then Topples
over, falls again...

261
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:05,533
My naive little umbrella! Sigh!

262
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:53,649
Go to sleep Nandu... Don't burn
your blood over that umbrella

263
00:36:56,728 --> 00:37:02,098
What does it matter to you?

264
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:06,262
I'm your only chance at
getting that umbrella

265
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:12,103
Do you even know what
2500 rupees look like?

266
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,434
Rupees?

267
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:27,448
Why, are you planning
to pluck it off a tree?

268
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:31,286
How about I flick it?

269
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:36,022
Provided you increase
my wages by 27 rupees

270
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:40,127
12 rupees is all you'll get

271
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:49,975
Okay, lets settle it
at 28. Fair Deal?

272
00:37:53,585 --> 00:37:57,316
I attended school just once
in my life, by chance...

273
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,580
and I learnt only one lesson

274
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,593
which I still haven't forgotten

275
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:05,254
What?

276
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:12,461
'Lt's a sin to steal you'll
become a snake's meal'

277
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,598
Goodnight

278
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:25,610
7 x2=14... 8x2=16... 9x2=18

279
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:33,285
Dinner is served!

280
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:45,035
Where's your plate?

281
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:46,161
I am not hungry!

282
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,632
Fine... I'm not eating either

283
00:38:57,248 --> 00:38:58,579
Why don't you understand?

284
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:00,907
Biniya is not selling

285
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,580
And we can't afford to buy a new one

286
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:06,416
What do you want me to do?

287
00:39:06,591 --> 00:39:08,252
Steal the umbrella?

288
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:19,319
Hey Neelu... Hey Gauri... let's go

289
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:25,657
It's going to rain... hurry up!

290
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:34,171
How much will you graze, fatsos?

291
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,654
Bijju Brother!!

292
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:30,486
I am really sad to hear that

293
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:35,987
Well, it was destined to be
with you for as many days...

294
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:43,990
We are all helpless
before God's will...

295
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:47,167
Here, eat something

296
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:54,004
This wont do, dear child

297
00:43:55,212 --> 00:44:00,275
Be a good girl and eat something...
Don't disrespect your food

298
00:44:13,364 --> 00:44:16,697
Let's go to the outpost...
It will be a nice break

299
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:19,962
Guess what?

300
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:24,633
Caught a dangerous bicycle
thief the other day...

301
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,974
Let's go visit him at the station...

302
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:36,315
If you continue your fast, we'll take
you to the city for an injection

303
00:44:36,387 --> 00:44:37,649
That too in the stomach

304
00:44:38,222 --> 00:44:41,589
Nowadays you get injections of
doughnuts and pancakes as well

305
00:44:51,402 --> 00:44:56,999
There was quite a strong
breeze that day...

306
00:44:57,074 --> 00:45:01,272
The umbrella must have
fallen into the ravine

307
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:08,947
In the jungle, peacocks dance...
Thieves!! No chance

308
00:45:09,954 --> 00:45:11,114
By chance!

309
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:28,230
In the jungle, peacocks dance...
Thieves!! No chance

310
00:45:29,306 --> 00:45:30,466
By chance!

311
00:45:34,712 --> 00:45:38,648
In the jungle, peacocks dance...
Thieves!! No chance

312
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:43,987
There was quite a strong
breeze that day...

313
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:47,650
The umbrella must have
fallen into the ravine

314
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:53,995
In the jungle, peacocks dance...
Thieves!! No chance...

315
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:56,329
By chance!

316
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:03,201
In the jungle, peacocks dance...
Thieves!! No chance

317
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:09,611
In the jungle, peacocks dance...
Thieves!! No chance

318
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:50,713
Open the door

319
00:46:51,222 --> 00:46:52,314
What's up?

320
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:53,583
We've come to search the place

321
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:56,450
What's the trouble?

322
00:46:56,527 --> 00:46:58,085
My umbrella has been stolen

323
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:12,600
Police! Police! Police
raid Nandu' shop

324
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,698
Do you suspect anyone else?

325
00:47:46,177 --> 00:47:47,974
Maybe he's hidden it someplace else

326
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:53,642
There it is!!

327
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:16,665
Understand?

328
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:19,940
What the hell do you want
me to understand?

329
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:24,110
At this age you strip
me of everything

330
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:29,610
And then, you expect
me to understand?

331
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:40,553
Is the word 'thief' tattooed
on my forehead?

332
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:44,360
Nandkishore... umbrella thief

333
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:46,461
Is it?

334
00:49:01,418 --> 00:49:02,510
Get out of my way!

335
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:29,935
Read out my passbook...
Atleast you can read...

336
00:49:30,014 --> 00:49:33,677
I am not a pauper!

337
00:49:34,952 --> 00:49:36,943
Nandkishore Khatri can
plant a field of...

338
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:38,613
umbrellas if he wants, understand?

339
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:43,957
Today in front of
the whole village...

340
00:49:44,028 --> 00:49:46,292
I take a vow

341
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:53,966
Till the day my own umbrella arrives,
I refuse to touch any pickle

342
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:00,135
Scram!

343
00:50:50,194 --> 00:50:54,187
Lts snowing on the far hills

344
00:50:54,765 --> 00:50:58,633
Cold snow cascading

345
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,237
Rolling down my face

346
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:12,972
lts snowing on the far hills
Cold snow cascading

347
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:15,978
Rolling down my face

348
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:23,654
My beloved!

349
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:35,336
O my beloved return home to me

350
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:22,248
Days seem shorter now

351
00:52:24,154 --> 00:52:26,987
Like yesterday's clothes

352
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:32,652
which rip apart bit by bit

353
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:52,005
The nights seem endless

354
00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:58,282
when you are away my life
ebbs away bit by bit

355
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:12,463
My beloved! Return home to me

356
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:55,662
Good morning uncle!

357
00:55:59,002 --> 00:56:04,269
12 rupees

358
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:06,933
Hi champ... what's up?

359
00:56:07,144 --> 00:56:08,941
Doing good...

360
00:56:09,546 --> 00:56:10,945
2 litres...

361
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:12,276
50 rupees

362
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:13,940
2 litres

363
00:56:14,017 --> 00:56:15,211
Yes buddy, 2 litres for 50 rupees

364
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:17,211
What rate are you selling
this oil at?

365
00:56:17,287 --> 00:56:18,948
How much is half times 50?

366
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:21,616
But you just sold it to
Chander for 12 rupees

367
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:24,123
For him, the price remains 12 rupees

368
00:56:27,631 --> 00:56:32,227
Let go champ... I dare you!

369
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:34,964
Hey Champ...

370
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:39,304
Pick on somebody your own size

371
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:49,977
Why are you being unfair, uncle?

372
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:53,648
What will you do? Drag me to
the town square and shoot me?

373
00:56:55,592 --> 00:56:56,991
Anyway, your sister has connections
in the police...

374
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,654
She can get anything done

375
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:04,592
Go on, take your champ
to the police station

376
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:07,267
Move it, man

377
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,943
What coat? My uncle...

378
00:57:17,013 --> 00:57:20,949
200 rupees... America exported

379
00:57:35,432 --> 00:57:37,559
Consider it your own, Teacher sir

380
00:57:39,035 --> 00:57:40,127
Touch it

381
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,635
You can borrow it on hire anytime

382
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:53,982
And Lilavati, I dare you to go home
this time without the umbrella...

383
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:57,144
Good lord!!

384
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:02,421
You are too kind

385
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,251
Don't mention it

386
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:19,941
Okay, I'm off!

387
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,940
One minute...

388
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:26,278
Khatri Sir is leaving!

389
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:28,679
How dare he leave!

390
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:38,960
Cauliflower... pickled
in fresh mustard oil

391
00:58:51,975 --> 00:58:55,308
You are just too much!

392
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,511
Do you stay under the umbrella
the whole day?

393
00:59:05,655 --> 00:59:07,418
No, the umbrella remains
above me the whole day

394
00:59:10,093 --> 00:59:12,425
Khatri sir even carries
it for his daily crap

395
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:16,658
Bloody oaf!

396
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:20,061
Wait till you come back to the shop

397
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:52,626
I can't do it, Chief

398
00:59:53,303 --> 00:59:56,966
How can a fool like me preside over
the wrestling championship?

399
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,135
Lts out of the question

400
00:59:59,576 --> 01:00:03,979
We are already ashamed about
the umbrella incident...

401
01:00:04,047 --> 01:00:08,643
Give us a chance to make it upto you

402
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:15,487
If you don't agree, there won't
be any championship this year

403
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:22,596
Fine... then have it your way

404
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:24,664
But, there's one condition

405
01:00:26,136 --> 01:00:28,001
The refreshments for the wrestlers
will be provided by me...

406
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:29,663
At half the price!

407
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,336
It shouldn't tear! Watch it!

408
01:01:57,627 --> 01:01:58,958
Lts very fragile...
please be careful...

409
01:01:59,029 --> 01:02:00,963
Please pull gently...

410
01:02:01,031 --> 01:02:02,965
My friend's really gotten spoilt...

411
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:05,467
Throws attitude whenever it wants

412
01:02:05,535 --> 01:02:07,969
Going to the city just to get
you fixed Please shut yourself

413
01:02:13,476 --> 01:02:14,704
It doesn't shut like that

414
01:03:10,133 --> 01:03:12,567
No... It never came from Delhi

415
01:03:14,037 --> 01:03:19,566
As far as I remember,
it was a local despatch

416
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,575
There you go!

417
01:03:32,722 --> 01:03:38,160
Chaudhary Dyers, Old
Temple Lane, Banikhet

418
01:03:54,677 --> 01:04:00,445
'The motorcade runs through
town crying pom pom'

419
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,947
Do you dye umbrellas out here?

420
01:04:12,695 --> 01:04:13,957
No!

421
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:15,558
What about batons?

422
01:05:14,457 --> 01:05:18,553
He who is strong of mind... is
the strongest of them all

423
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:26,134
I have wrestled all my life

424
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:29,298
with life itself

425
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:35,644
Been working since the age of 8

426
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:38,977
the coal business today

427
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:43,145
then worked at the washers

428
01:05:44,587 --> 01:05:46,316
then toiled as a farmhand

429
01:05:47,257 --> 01:05:49,987
Later as a carpenter's apprentice

430
01:05:51,995 --> 01:05:56,489
So friends, its been
a constant struggle

431
01:05:57,667 --> 01:06:02,104
Had no time to even get
married, by chance

432
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:12,546
Used to wash dishes in the
same shop I own today...

433
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,448
Like my friend Rajaram here

434
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:40,971
I have seen all colours of life

435
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:02,927
Khatri has flung mud in the
face of the entire village

436
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:05,092
Not only did he steal, he lied
to everyone shamelessly

437
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,932
The bench has decided that because
of this heinous crime...

438
01:07:10,006 --> 01:07:12,531
he should be banished
from the village

439
01:07:12,675 --> 01:07:19,103
We beg Nandu to find some
other village to settle in

440
01:07:19,549 --> 01:07:22,950
The jury also orders
the entire village...

441
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:25,954
to henceforth boycott Nandkishore
Khatri's shop

442
01:07:26,956 --> 01:07:30,949
Congratulations to dear Biniya
on finding the umbrella

443
01:07:31,027 --> 01:07:33,962
and load and loads of good wishes

444
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:11,917
Stop the bus! Tea and
snacks on the house...

445
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:17,432
Everything for free... please
stop the bus

446
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:19,265
Damn you!

447
01:09:21,003 --> 01:09:24,097
Damn all of you!

448
01:09:50,466 --> 01:09:52,957
4 toffees free with
every 2 biscuits!

449
01:09:54,504 --> 01:09:58,634
We don't want any!

450
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:02,974
Hey Tikku! Have this biscuit

451
01:10:03,312 --> 01:10:04,370
I don't want it

452
01:10:04,447 --> 01:10:09,976
For you, its free Go on, take it

453
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:12,320
I can't... mum will beat me up

454
01:10:17,326 --> 01:10:19,487
4 toffees free with
every 2 biscuits!

455
01:10:19,562 --> 01:10:23,396
Nandkishore Umbrella thief

456
01:10:23,466 --> 01:10:24,990
Nandkishore Umbrella thief

457
01:10:25,067 --> 01:10:26,659
Nandkishore Umbrella thief

458
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:52,747
Who's there?

459
01:12:10,573 --> 01:12:11,972
Who the hell?

460
01:12:21,317 --> 01:12:22,648
It's a bear claw!

461
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:25,653
Will make a locket out of it

462
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:31,043
Khatri, why don't you move
to some other village?

463
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:38,313
Which village will shelter
a thief like me?

464
01:14:42,324 --> 01:14:47,660
This village is my own...
so what if they loathe me

465
01:14:52,668 --> 01:14:55,728
Now there is only one final
journey left to take

466
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:35,143
What's with the song and dance? Has
there been a birth in the village?

467
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:37,139
No, there's a wedding

468
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:38,537
Whose?

469
01:15:39,982 --> 01:15:41,313
The village chief's son

470
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,981
Chandu's?

471
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:49,488
Our Chander's getting married!

472
01:15:50,726 --> 01:15:53,320
Silly lad couldn't even tie
his pajamas till yesterday!

473
01:15:57,733 --> 01:16:00,531
How time flies!

474
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:11,102
Line me up for a shave too...
need to look decent

475
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:17,942
Else everybody will think
I've escaped from the zoo

476
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:22,614
Try and shave the pricks off
his conscience as well

477
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:41,298
Why has the music stopped?

478
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:42,632
Have you been invited?

479
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:46,370
Family members don't
need invitations

480
01:17:46,442 --> 01:17:48,137
Chandar's like my own son

481
01:17:48,477 --> 01:17:51,571
See what I got for you...

482
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:54,973
You'll be thrilled to bits

483
01:17:55,584 --> 01:18:01,921
A bear claw charm! Specially
made for you...

484
01:18:01,991 --> 01:18:09,261
Go on...

485
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:11,530
Be warned... chief

486
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:14,592
If the claw turns out to be stolen,
the bear might come knocking!

487
01:19:39,955 --> 01:19:41,115
Got any biscuits?

488
01:20:30,139 --> 01:20:33,666
Don't you get 4 toffees free
with every 2 biscuits?

489
01:20:53,762 --> 01:20:55,024
The tea is boiling over!

490
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:45,517
Wait up... child

491
01:25:46,455 --> 01:25:49,481
Wait a second

492
01:25:55,163 --> 01:26:00,533
Your umbrella... you
forgot it at the shop

493
01:26:06,942 --> 01:26:08,933
This is not mine...

494
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,274
By chance

495
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:44,565
You haven't heard of Bill Gate?

496
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:47,631
Worth millions and
millions of rupees!
