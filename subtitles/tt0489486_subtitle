1
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,018
The ambience is romantic.

2
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,604
Let's fall in love.

3
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,273
Come, come, come.

4
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,858
Come, beloved.

5
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,820
The ambience is romantic.

6
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,114
Let's fall in love.

7
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,034
Come, come, come.

8
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,536
Come, beloved.

9
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:27,962
What else is there in this heart?

10
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,316
When you were born...
you didn't cry...

11
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,776
...even when the nurse hit you.

12
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,028
I should have understood then only.

13
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,073
You are not those who cry but
those who make others cry.

14
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,701
Pops, please. Chill!

15
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,161
I don't know about that, son.

16
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,124
But since the time you have been
rusticated from three colleges...

17
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,043
...I have started taking BP pills.

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,170
How you are still in BSS college
for past 2 months...

19
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,882
...without creating any problem...
God only knows.

20
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,554
Actually you are right, pops. It's
very bad for my reputation.

21
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,639
- What!
- I will have to do something.

22
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,058
Listen to me carefully, Raju!

23
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,854
If you did mess up things
in this college then from...

24
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,606
...3 rooms in the house, one
room will be evacuated.

25
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,151
Pops, please. Where will
you go at this age?

26
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,402
- What?
- What?

27
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,446
Bad! Very bad!

28
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,823
Now he has got a new craze
after going to the college.

29
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,577
Under the pretext of studying,
he fights in college...

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,745
...he abuses and he threatens people.

31
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,207
This is Raju Malhotra. He
is a stigma. A stigma!

32
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,606
Now stop it! Enough of studying.

33
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,151
I forgot to add Boost in your milk.

34
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,028
No problem, mummy.

35
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,947
I had done pranayam taught
by Ramdev Baba.

36
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,993
Son, when you were born
I thought that...

37
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:26,414
...my son will grow up
to be a stud like me.

38
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,501
But you are only concerned
about studies.

39
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,754
You neither have any friend
nor any social group.

40
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,422
No PR, no marketing.

41
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,883
You only work on the computer.

42
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,843
After that you will be gone.

43
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,347
Others' fathers say that my son
will achieve something in life.

44
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,226
My son will make his parents proud.

45
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,104
But papa, to which destination
you want me...

46
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,481
Son, my destination
is, I want that...

47
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,567
...you should not be Koi
Mil Gaya's Hrithik.

48
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,361
Son, be like Hrithik
of Krish movie.

49
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,780
Socialize like me.
And make me proud.

50
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,700
Why are you teaching wrong
things to my son?

51
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,867
What is in this?

52
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,661
He wants me to be like him.

53
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,955
But I don't want to be
a businessman like him.

54
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,333
I want to be an IAS officer
and serve the country.

55
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,504
After becoming IAS officer
will you accept bribe?

56
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,506
What kind of a papa are you?

57
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,216
If you had your way, you
would have written...

58
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,676
...on my hand that my
father is a thief!

59
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,344
What did you say? What did you say?

60
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,766
Son... I don't tell you
to be a bad boy.

61
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,270
But you only have to handle
your papa's business.

62
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,438
That is what I am explaining to him!

63
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,482
What is his business? To
drink and serve others.

64
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,152
Please! Let me live my
life the way I want!

65
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,528
I am Rajan!

66
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,114
I am not going to change myself!
I am what I am!

67
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,282
Son...

68
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,450
Rajan!

69
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,537
- Down with BSS!
- Down with Debo Chaterjee!

70
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,498
- Down with BSS!
- Down with Debo Chaterjee!

71
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,916
Down with BSS!

72
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,835
What is a child's right?

73
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,212
That he gets Farex twice in a day.

74
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,883
A new nappy after every 3 hours.
And a new toy after every 2 days.

75
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,011
We used to get these rights
when we were small.

76
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,096
But since the time we have
joined this college...

77
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,431
...all these rights have
been snatched from us!

78
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,561
Commotion? Sir!

79
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,481
Now there is bound to be
commotion in college...

80
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,067
...and not in Nursery or KG.

81
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,778
If you can't handle the
college students...

82
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,364
...then give your resignation
immediately.

83
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,324
No, sir! There is no problem, sir!

84
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,078
Sir, everything is under the table.

85
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,121
I mean everything is under control.

86
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,707
Here it's very peaceful.

87
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,335
It's the right of every young
girl to wear short skirt...

88
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,005
...to feel cool in the sizzling heat.

89
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,758
And it's the right of
every young guy...

90
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,802
...to see girls in short skirts.

91
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,807
I say... you all have
to decide whether...

92
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,935
...you want to give the exams or not!

93
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,158
You are bad.

94
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,703
You are bad.

95
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,874
You are good.

96
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,377
You are good.

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,597
Pretty, pretty, pretty babe!

98
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,600
Wants to know...

99
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,278
You are bad.

100
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,529
You are bad.

101
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,157
You are a bad, bad boy.

102
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,658
You are bad.

103
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,868
You are bad.

104
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,370
You are a bad, bad boy.

105
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,956
You are good. You are good.

106
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,625
You are a good, good boy.

107
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,793
You are good.

108
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,253
You are good.

109
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,881
You are a good, good boy.

110
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,925
My beloved's hug.

111
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,178
My love's hug.

112
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,722
My beloved's hug.

113
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,391
My love's hug.

114
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,436
It gives me solace.

115
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,897
It takes me to heaven.

116
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,857
I am bad. I am bad.

117
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,693
I am a bad, bad boy.

118
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,154
You are bad. You are bad.

119
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,990
You are a bad, bad boy.

120
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,659
My beloved's hug.

121
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,245
My love's hug.

122
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,248
It gives me solace.

123
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,334
It takes me to heaven.

124
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,710
I am bad.

125
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,961
I am bad.

126
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,464
I am a bad, bad boy.

127
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,799
You are bad.

128
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,008
You are bad.

129
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,719
You are a bad, bad boy.

130
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,201
My heart, heart, heart.

131
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,912
My heart is crazy.

132
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:21,167
It loves you all the time.

133
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,087
You are the desire of my breath.

134
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,631
You are my dream.

135
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,803
My each heartbeat
has accepted you.

136
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,556
The slight heat of chill.

137
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,891
The charm of your beauty.

138
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,853
It gives me solace.

139
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,855
It takes me to heaven.

140
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,189
I am bad.

141
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,482
I am bad.

142
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,068
I am a bad, bad boy.

143
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,319
You are bad.

144
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,696
You are bad.

145
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,449
You are a bad, bad boy.

146
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,701
Go, go, go.

147
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,495
Beloved.

148
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:02,917
You don't know what
my desires are.

149
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,837
I don't like anything without you.

150
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,256
Without you, without you.

151
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,009
Without you, nothing seems lively.

152
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,345
Without you, without you.

153
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,181
This grace of your saunter.

154
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,641
The fragrance of your cheeks.

155
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,478
It gives me solace.

156
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,605
It takes me to heaven.

157
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,939
I am bad.

158
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,524
I am bad.

159
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,860
I am a bad, bad boy.

160
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,070
You are bad.

161
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,404
You are bad.

162
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,074
You are a bad, bad boy.

163
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,659
You are bad. You are bad.

164
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,371
You are a bad, bad boy.

165
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,165
You are good. You are good.

166
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,793
You are a good, good boy.

167
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,379
You are bad. You are bad.

168
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,881
You are a bad, bad boy.

169
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,174
You are bad.

170
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,717
You are bad.

171
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,261
You are a bad, bad boy.

172
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,514
Hey!

173
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,081
- That's okay. Now you can leave.
- Okay, sir.

174
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,337
He is Awasthi. What
is he doing here?

175
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:37,429
Maybe we need Awasthi to reform
the state of this college.

176
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,607
I am your new Principal.
Diwan Chand Awasthi.

177
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,028
There will be a meeting
tomorrow evening...

178
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,654
...at 4 in the college hall.

179
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,743
Now I want the introductions
to be done properly.

180
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,665
Yours... mine... ours.

181
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,895
In life everybody has
a responsibility.

182
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,066
You all and I too have
a responsibility.

183
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,821
Your responsibility is to study
and be a better human being.

184
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:41,576
And my responsibility is to make
you all a better human being.

185
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,206
You all will be sad to know...
I have a bad habit...

186
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,793
...of fulfilling my responsibility.

187
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,842
So... whether you all want or not...

188
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,179
...you all will have to fulfill
your responsibility from today.

189
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,973
Otherwise the consequence
will be very bad.

190
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,060
In this college...

191
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,525
Excuse me.

192
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:18,488
I think somebody has messaged
you a funny joke.

193
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,989
Right?

194
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,159
Come and show it to us on the
stage. We all will laugh.

195
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,994
Come on the stage.

196
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,831
Just come on the stage.

197
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:45,181
This principal is a big bore.
P for 'Pakau' (Bore). 'Pakau'!

198
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,978
Mr. Dinesh's point of view about
me is very interesting!

199
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,272
Mr. Dinesh! Mr. Long Hair Wonder!

200
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,984
Please come on the stage.
And accompany me.

201
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,486
Please come on the stage.

202
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,490
Hi.

203
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:08,038
You think that I am a big bore.
P for 'Pakau' (Bore).

204
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,125
You think that I relate to the
alphabet P.

205
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,377
I will tell you about myself.

206
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,255
I relate to the alphabet E.

207
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,216
Now I will give you
both E certificates.

208
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,552
You are expelled.

209
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,691
Destruction.

210
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,361
He expelled Dinesh from the college.

211
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,280
This Principal won't stay
in this college for long.

212
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,492
He expelled MLA's son.

213
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,120
What does he think
of himself? Oh no!

214
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,667
Hello!

215
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,834
Papa!

216
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,588
Papa!

217
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,925
Papa, this is Rashmi speaking.

218
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,887
Mr. Awasthi, this
is Rashmi speaking.

219
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,473
That's correct. Tell me, Rashmi.

220
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,102
Sorry, sir. I forgot that
I can't call you papa.

221
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,648
From today I will address you
only as sir or Mr. Awasthi.

222
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,318
You see, this agreement between
father and daughter...

223
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,404
...is because I don't know
the college students...

224
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,031
...to find out that you are my
daughter and exploit you.

225
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,993
- You know that.
- I know, papa. Sorry! Sir!

226
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,704
But sir... your arrival
in the college has...

227
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,457
...for a moment put the
bad boys into trouble.

228
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:39,170
It will happen more often. See
what happens in the future.

229
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,465
Sir, you will get a
gold medal in acting.

230
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,885
I have already won that a long
time ago in this college.

231
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,054
Tell me, dear. What is going on?

232
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,557
Look... now you addressed me as dear.

233
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,893
I am your student living
in the hostel.

234
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,103
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

235
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,481
At times I have some problem
in playing this double role.

236
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,402
That's it. Okay, dear.
Bye. Sorry. Bye.

237
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,611
Bye.

238
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,327
Yesterday evening on
the college stage...

239
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,040
...you had played the role
of a plastic principal.

240
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,084
That was good! Good!

241
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,087
But... you have to maintain that.

242
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,507
Here guys are very smart!

243
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:30,180
And you have to be smarter
than them. Understand.

244
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,559
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
I have understood!

245
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,233
'What a college! What existence!
What fun!'

246
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:47,947
'There was only one hero. Me.
Diwan Chand Awasthi.'

247
00:15:55,538 --> 00:16:00,335
'Sir, I could have never thought,
the college where I studied...

248
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:04,756
...under your guidance... I've become
the principal of that college.'

249
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,636
'Sir... now students don't
need idol of conduct Ram...

250
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:14,224
...they need Krishna
as per today's time.'

251
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,272
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

252
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,735
Oh God! Run!

253
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,913
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah.

254
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,375
- Sir, we want to leave this college.
- Yes, sir.

255
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,626
What!

256
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,503
Please don't misunderstand us, sir.

257
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,381
But our family has great
expectations from us.

258
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,633
And we have always been
good students. But...

259
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,344
But the current college ambience...

260
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,512
...you can see it for yourself.

261
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:57,767
We can't study in this state.
So we... sorry, sir.

262
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,823
'Mr. Awasthi, the exam is not easy.'

263
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,284
'You will have to tolerate
many things.'

264
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,080
Principal Awasthi!

265
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,170
Yes, man!

266
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,840
Your responsibility is to study.

267
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,259
My responsibility is to educate you.

268
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,805
E for education. A for arrest.
Dinesh was right.

269
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,391
This new Principal is
P for 'Pakau' (A bore).

270
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,938
Hit! Hit!

271
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,733
Why did you stop?

272
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,610
What's your problem?

273
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:53,073
The face on which you are throwing
the darts, he is your guru.

274
00:17:54,407 --> 00:18:00,372
There was Eklavya. For his guru,
he cut his thumb. And you!

275
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,376
What's the use of cutting the thumb?

276
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,544
What will we get in return? Nothing.

277
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,755
What are you trying to say?

278
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,799
For example look at our exams.

279
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,550
In our country intelligence
is measured...

280
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,929
...only by the marks that
we score in the exams.

281
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:20,016
And did you know? Einstein whom
people call as a genius...

282
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,020
...he was stupid in school.

283
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,607
You think that you can change the
system by behaving like this.

284
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:31,319
Yes. Uncle Einstein's theory...
every action has...

285
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:36,074
...an equal and opposite...
attraction.

286
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:41,371
Firstly it's Newton. And secondly,
not attraction.

287
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,960
Not now. But it will happen someday.

288
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,338
It will never happen.
Do you know why?

289
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,216
Because Newton's actual theory is...

290
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,970
...for every action there is an
equal and opposite reaction.

291
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,984
- Come quickly.
- What happened?

292
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,277
The guy's family has
come to see ma'am.

293
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,570
- Oh no!
- The alliance is almost fixed.

294
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,321
- Oh no!
- Come quickly! - I forgot!

295
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,407
Take it.

296
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,367
Sorry, guys! I am very
sorry. I am late.

297
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,870
There was so much traffic
on the road.

298
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,621
My bike too broke down. But...

299
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,499
- You!
- Oh no!

300
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,795
I think you know my son Raju.

301
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,841
Yes! And if I had known that this
goon is Kavita's brother...

302
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,135
...I would have never come here.

303
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,511
What has he done?

304
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,638
What has he done? Look at this!

305
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,435
He was in a stupor in the disco.
And he misbehaved with my sister.

306
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,396
When I tried to stop him...
he smashed...

307
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,482
...the beer bottle on my head.

308
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,734
You see... that day I was too drunk.

309
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,819
And there was some misunderstanding.

310
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,863
It's okay. It's my mistake.

311
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,823
I have done a mistake
by coming here.

312
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,951
The girl whose brother misbehaved
with my sister...

313
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,205
...and who hit me... I should
make her my wife...

314
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,248
...you must be crazy, man.

315
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,336
Hey! You can say anything about me.

316
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,421
But if you said anything
about my sister then...

317
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,924
...I will break the coconut
on your head.

318
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,052
- You will hit me? Did you see this papa?
- Mama!

319
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,763
- Let's leave immediately.
- Okay.
- Look!

320
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,933
Don't reject the alliance.

321
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:28,561
I know my son has made a mistake.

322
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:33,274
- I apologize for that. Please. Please don't go!
- Listen!

323
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:38,947
I am sorry.

324
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,117
You are sorry? You know
what is your problem?

325
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,703
You are always sorry, brother.

326
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,831
And you know what...
today I am sorry.

327
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,916
Because I am your sister.

328
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:04,097
- Dad, I am...
- Congrats, son.

329
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,809
I am really proud
that you are a bad boy.

330
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,607
How can he do this?

331
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,028
To rusticate the student
for a trivial matter.

332
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:21,114
I don't agree with this.

333
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,242
After all students need freedom.

334
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,996
Excuse me, ma'am. What is
freedom according to you?

335
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:34,044
Freedom means... living
life to the fullest.

336
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:36,880
Oh God!

337
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,510
Ma'am! Explain it in detail.

338
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:47,265
You see... we like your
this kind of freedom.

339
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,267
Raju!

340
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,646
You all... are Hanuman's apes.

341
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:58,651
Ma'am, don't you think... freedom
that is careless...

342
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,403
...it is not freedom but destruction.

343
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:01,946
Excuse me!

344
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,450
Every person has a different
point of view.

345
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,079
For example according to me if
students gets the permission...

346
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,873
...to bunk the lecture...
then that is freedom.

347
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,750
- Am I right, guys?
- Yeah!

348
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,920
What is freedom according
to you all?

349
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,464
Chikoo gets to marry Awasthi.

350
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:20,715
That is called freedom.

351
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,592
When girls are always
free with guys...

352
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,928
...that is freedom, man!

353
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,806
When you get clothes at 100%
discount in shopping mall...

354
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:28,973
...that is freedom.

355
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,976
The day every youth of this
country has a job...

356
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,144
...that is freedom.

357
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,314
If my boyfriend allows me to have
affairs with other guys...

358
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:37,816
...that is called freedom.

359
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,568
Isn't 'Azadi' (freedom) Manoj
Kumar's movie's title?

360
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:46,783
When a boring lecture ends...
that is freedom.

361
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,993
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

362
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,376
Good afternoon, sir.

363
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,935
'Sir, we want to leave
this college.'

364
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,813
'Our family has great
expectations from us.'

365
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,898
'And we have always been
good students. But...'

366
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,984
'But the current college ambience...

367
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,237
'We can't study in this state.'

368
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,661
Friends. We are leaving the college.

369
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:35,040
- Take care, buddy.
- We will meet again.
- Bye.

370
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,541
Come.

371
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,835
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

372
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:43,089
You must have heard students
telling the principal...

373
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,966
...sir, give me one more chance.

374
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,094
But what if principal
tells the student...

375
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,139
...give me one more chance?

376
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,808
Sir, you are embarrassing us.

377
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,686
We love you, sir.

378
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,607
Look, if you love me... you should
love the college also.

379
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:05,195
So I reject your application for
leaving the college. Okay.

380
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,447
- Go and attend the classes.
- Okay, sir.
- Yes, sir.

381
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,115
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

382
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,079
You all must be thinking
why I have called...

383
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,748
...you all here suddenly.

384
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:21,378
I will divide my students
into 3 categories.

385
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,006
Those below 50% in C section.

386
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:28,635
Between 50%-70% in B section.

387
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,013
And above 70% in A section.

388
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,432
What? Class A, B and C!

389
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,643
Do we have to learn
A, B and C again!

390
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:41,690
The bright students of A section...
we just have to guide them.

391
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,692
I think it's a fantastic idea!

392
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:48,780
We have to motivate B section
students to fare better.

393
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,116
I want to be with bad boys!

394
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,912
And teach discipline to study
to section C students.

395
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,668
So start dividing the
students into sections.

396
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,211
I think it's a great idea!

397
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,754
Is this a college or Howrah train?

398
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:08,341
Bogie first class, bogie second
class. It's a bad idea.

399
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,634
Yes!

400
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:14,514
- They may put us into any sections.
- Great! Great! It's great!

401
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:18,184
- An amazing thing has happened.
- What happened?

402
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:23,231
Our new principal has divided
the animals from humans.

403
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,650
You have gone mad!

404
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,986
Keep quiet, 50% students!

405
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,447
During Diwali, you gave me stale
food instead of sweets!

406
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,284
Now under section C you will be
punished in the scorching heat!

407
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,788
And I will mock your
state and enjoy!

408
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:40,957
You!

409
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:44,085
- Hail principal! Hail principal!
- Now understand.

410
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:48,006
Freedom is gone. And destruction
has started.

411
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,966
Today he rusticated Dinesh.

412
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,593
Tomorrow he can do anything.

413
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:55,096
- Why didn't he think before?
I wonder. I am very happy.
- Me too.

414
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,556
Everything has changed in 2 days.

415
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,892
Hey! How did you say that?

416
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:02,437
- With my mouth.
- Mouth!

417
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,691
Nowadays you have started
talking a lot.

418
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:10,403
- What is going on?
- Nothing, sir.

419
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:14,491
We all are friends. We were having
some fun. So you know...

420
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,034
Nothing to worry.

421
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,536
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

422
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,003
Yes.

423
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:32,884
Yes, yes. Vinay.

424
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:37,847
Yo!

425
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,558
They come to quarrel, not to study.

426
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,061
You got scared?

427
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,856
I am scared of myself. I hate lies.

428
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,234
If principal had found
out about them...

429
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,319
...they would have been rusticated.

430
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,446
I didn't want that to happen.

431
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,038
I am very happy.

432
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,915
- Yeah. It's a cool idea!
- Actually!

433
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:07,085
- At least those students will feel relaxed.
- I know.

434
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,629
Those who come to study in the
college and not to kill time.

435
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:10,797
- I swear.
- Exactly.

436
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,301
I think it's a very stupid idea!

437
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,555
What you think... who
has asked you that?

438
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,682
Life is like 'Bhel Puri'
(a kind of snacks).

439
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,226
Like what? 'Bhel Puri'.

440
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,189
It has sweet things like me. And
some spicy things like you.

441
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:34,195
Now if both are separated, life
becomes dull. Like Awasthi.

442
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:39,242
Listen, if you think we can be
together, then you are mistaken.

443
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,869
It's impossible!

444
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:45,040
Impossible! If you separate
impossible... what do you get?

445
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,584
I am possible.

446
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:52,422
By the way I like difficulties
and spicy things.

447
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:57,469
Really? Well then... try it.
But you will lose.

448
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,637
Because I am impossible!

449
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,561
Ms. Difficult!

450
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,482
Did you call me, ma'am?

451
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:15,362
- Yes, Bakeda. Listen to me carefully.
- Okay, ma'am. Go on.

452
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:19,866
Look, I was saying that section
A, B and C's student...

453
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,159
Will go to watch a movie.

454
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:24,454
When did I say that? Don't
try to act smart!

455
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:29,459
- I said to stick their photo on the ID card.
- Okay.

456
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:34,464
List A has toppers. Average
in B. And dull students in C.

457
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:38,218
Put it up on the notice
board tomorrow morning.

458
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,346
It will be done, ma'am.

459
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:47,143
Confusion, ma'am! Confusion!

460
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:50,105
Here R. Malhotra. And
there R. Malhotra.

461
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,736
I will solve the confusion.

462
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,502
Malhotra and Malhotra!

463
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:26,599
Congrats. You are in class A.

464
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:30,228
- Are you joking?
- You are there, buddy!

465
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:35,942
What...

466
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:49,831
Class A!

467
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,585
Hey guys, do you see my name?

468
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,211
- Excuse me!
- Hurry up!

469
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:58,882
- One second!
- Let him see! Let him see!
- Oh no!

470
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,472
Where is my name, man?
I don't see my name!

471
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:06,723
How come my name is
not in section A?

472
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:13,396
Because baby... your name...
from top to bottom...

473
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,943
...is above my name.

474
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,219
Good morning, sir.

475
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,263
Sir, my name is Rajan Malhotra.

476
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,349
I have scored 92%.

477
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,476
I hope you understand, sir.

478
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,062
This is some other R.
Malhotra on whose ID...

479
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,438
...my photo has been affixed.

480
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:58,316
Sir, please just look
into the matter.

481
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,818
There has been a terrible mistake.

482
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,987
Nab that fraud and give
him severe punishment.

483
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,656
Hand him over to the police.

484
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,371
Yes, brother. What has happened
with you, it is bad!

485
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,498
You should complain to the police.

486
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:16,626
Call them. Shall I dial the number?

487
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:23,591
This R Malhotra, whose ID you
have got... I am that person.

488
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:27,512
- Raju Malhotra.
- You?
- Yes.

489
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,681
And I have thought, good student...

490
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:33,309
...that we should carry on
this mistake of fate.

491
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:36,229
- Right?
- No! This will be a crime!

492
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,149
If the principal found out,
he will rusticate us!

493
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:43,319
Look, principal will
only rusticate you.

494
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:47,615
You don't know what I will do.

495
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:50,785
You don't know me.

496
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:54,956
By the way, I am such a fool.

497
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:58,793
If we think about it, how
will principal find out?

498
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,087
Neither I will tell him
nor will you tell him.

499
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:02,881
And why not?

500
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,966
If you will be in A class,
you will learn something.

501
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,635
I can even study in C class.

502
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:10,513
Exactly! This is called fate,
destiny, kismat.

503
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,599
Whatever you call it.

504
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,478
Now I will be in A class. And
she will also be in A class.

505
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:17,645
Who?

506
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:18,855
College's heroine!

507
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,691
Wow! Isn't that great!

508
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,195
Yes! Yes! Great! Great! Superb!

509
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,948
I am so happy. Shall
I tell you something?

510
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:32,369
We both can be good friends.
Because I really like you.

511
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:36,373
We are buddies, man. All right!

512
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:40,752
- So... friends.
- Yes. Friends.

513
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:44,506
Not like this! Like men!
Friend vs friend!

514
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,966
Malhotra vs Malhotra! Great!

515
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,095
Let's go and check at the hospital...

516
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,013
...whether we both had got
exchanged as babies or not.

517
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:58,144
Don't worry. Henceforth nobody will
trouble you in this college.

518
00:32:58,228 --> 00:32:59,312
I am there.

519
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:01,356
I am being too emotional.
Embrace me.

520
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:04,943
A section!

521
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:08,446
Don't cry, friend! It happens!
It happens!

522
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,783
So what if you are in section
C this time? I will teach you.

523
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,660
Next time you will be in A section.

524
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,828
Don't worry! Don't worry!
Don't worry!

525
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:21,626
Why is this scene going
on in my office?

526
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:25,130
Sir, you have segregated
A, B and C section.

527
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:26,589
So he has got separated from me.

528
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:29,968
He is my friend. He is in
C section. He scored 30%.

529
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,386
I was consoling him.

530
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,764
Sir, actually the reason of
meeting you is my daddy.

531
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:35,974
Daddy?

532
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:38,685
Sir, P.K. Malhotra. Sir, he
was worried that I might...

533
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:41,813
...get spoiled with these
C class students.

534
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:44,315
He has thanked you for
your experiment.

535
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,401
What does your daddy do?

536
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:47,986
Sir, he is an IAS officer.

537
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,530
- It can be seen.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,532
The values of the
family can be seen.

539
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:53,742
Thank you, sir.

540
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,702
- Are you in section A?
- Yes, sir.

541
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,707
Sir, actually only a jeweler
can assess a gem.

542
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,792
Enough! Enough! Enough!
No movie dialogues.

543
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:04,210
Please. Okay.

544
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,254
Do you want to say something?
Anything else?

545
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,465
- Yes, sir. You see...
- Excuse me!

546
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,469
- Sir!
- Yeah.

547
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,679
- Sir, do you want to transfer Ajay to section C?
- Yeah.

548
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:17,265
- What about Sunil?
- Yeah! Of course.

549
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,517
- Sure, sir?
- Yeah!

550
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,603
- But...
- Just do it!

551
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:24,481
But sir, he deserves section A.

552
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:26,691
No arguments and no excuses. Okay.

553
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:29,736
- Okay, sir.
- Don't teach a teacher. Sorry, sir.

554
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,531
Let's go!

555
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,045
'What is life?'

556
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:48,713
'Compromise.'

557
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:52,550
'If a bad boy wants to
become a good boy...

558
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,678
...then I should help him.'

559
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:58,807
'And as it is in A class
he can't misbehave.'

560
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:01,434
'He loves Rashmi.'

561
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,187
'That's why he has taken
such a big risk.'

562
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:26,209
What are you doing in this class?

563
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:27,627
Ma'am, I am trying to feel you.

564
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,799
I mean, I feel very
positive with you.

565
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:36,553
You were feeling so negative
about the exams.

566
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:40,015
Then... how did you score 90%?

567
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:42,726
No, ma'am. You thought
of me negatively.

568
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,394
I had a negative outlook
towards exams.

569
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:47,355
You know what we are
taught in math.

570
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,107
What?

571
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:54,487
That... if you mix 2 negatives,
the result is positive.

572
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:58,199
Do you understand, ma'am...
what I am saying.

573
00:35:58,283 --> 00:35:59,743
Rocky, stand straight!

574
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:05,999
Raju!

575
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,084
Move back! Let him come!

576
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:12,213
Raju has come! Raju! Raju! Raju!

577
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,883
Raju! Raju! Raju!

578
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,346
- Silence!
- The bore has come!

579
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:20,555
Silence! Silence!

580
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,559
Your philosophy professor
is in the class.

581
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:26,394
And you all have created a scene.

582
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:30,148
We were just relieving tension
from our body and relaxing.

583
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:34,110
So that we all could feel
fresh for your lecture.

584
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:37,447
Really? Really? Then... then...
why didn't you tell me before?

585
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:41,034
You all don't know. I am not
just a philosophy professor.

586
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:43,244
I am a yogi too.

587
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:44,579
Rogi (Patient)!

588
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,456
Sir, what aliment are
you suffering from?

589
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,667
Not Rogi, Yogi!

590
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:52,671
Yoga. I am a professor
of meditation.

591
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:56,758
Of peace. Everybody close your eyes.

592
00:36:56,841 --> 00:37:00,679
Today we all will meditate before
the philosophy class.

593
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:02,013
For Anand (peace).

594
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:07,102
Who, sir? We know only one Anand.
Evergreen Dev Anand.

595
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:10,063
To remain evergreen like Dev Anand...

596
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:12,273
...we should enjoy each joy of life.

597
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:16,820
So everybody... close your eyes.
And repeat with me.

598
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:20,490
Om!

599
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:26,746
Om!

600
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,832
Om!

601
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:33,753
Om!

602
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:40,301
Om!

603
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:52,814
Very good! Open your eyes! Look
it's so peaceful around.

604
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:55,942
All the evil powers have gone.

605
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:59,029
Because they couldn't find peace.

606
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:05,869
Look at her. She too is looking
so peacefully at you. Look.

607
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,796
It's not as pretty as you. But...

608
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:19,924
I have got it for you.

609
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:23,011
What happened? What happened?
What happened?

610
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:26,389
Sorry. I have allergy from flowers.

611
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:30,643
Oh no!

612
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:45,575
Students... what made man evolve
from apes to humans?

613
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,245
Can you hear?

614
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:55,001
What made man evolve
from apes to humans?

615
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:57,796
Maybe he got bored of
eating bananas, sir.

616
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:00,965
Very funny!

617
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:03,843
Change, revolution, transformation
is the norm of life.

618
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:08,807
We ourselves see how our body
and mind undergoes changes...

619
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,100
...from childhood to old age.

620
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:11,559
Great!

621
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:13,311
All right! Next!

622
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:27,867
You are a very impressive
student! I am pleased!

623
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:31,121
Yes, sir! When I get involved
in something...

624
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:32,414
...I get completely engrossed.

625
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,332
Once I am in, I am in.

626
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,376
Stop doing that!

627
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:38,420
Okay, man!

628
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:41,715
- Good morning! Good morning, sir!
- Good morning!

629
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:43,425
Good morning!

630
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:45,760
Sit down. Have a seat. Please.

631
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:51,850
Look, no matter how much
a teacher teaches...

632
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:53,935
...he can't do anything till the
time the student doesn't learn.

633
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:55,937
It is not the teacher who teaches.

634
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:57,522
It is the student who learns.

635
00:39:58,148 --> 00:40:01,276
Sir, it means the salary that
you get for teaching...

636
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,987
...we should actually
get it for learning.

637
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:06,781
- Good!
- Thank you.

638
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,534
You just heard me. You
didn't understand me.

639
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,578
- Anyway!
- Keep quiet!

640
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:12,787
There must be many students here...

641
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:14,748
...who read Gayatri Mantra at home.

642
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:15,957
Yes, sir!

643
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:17,959
Recite it.

644
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,171
Yes.

645
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:34,934
Cool!

646
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:39,105
Correct!

647
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:40,732
Do you know the meaning?

648
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:47,197
Go, go! Say it!

649
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,115
Sir, I don't know its meaning.

650
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,535
Mummy taught me. And I memorized it.

651
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:55,288
Exactly my point!

652
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:57,582
This is another example
of learning...

653
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:58,750
...without understanding.

654
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,045
Is there anybody here who knows
the meaning of Gayatri Mantra?

655
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:05,090
Yeah.

656
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:09,844
It means... O Goddess, dispel
the darkness within us.

657
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:13,348
And fill us with truth
and sacrifice.

658
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:15,100
Good! Good!

659
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:18,561
How much% have you scored?

660
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,271
Sir, 92%...

661
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:24,734
I mean... I can't get 92%,
sir. Its 35%.

662
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:26,820
Silence! Look... before
laughing at him...

663
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:31,574
...we should think whether we
are laughing at ourselves.

664
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:35,120
It's also possible that
this guy might score 90%.

665
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:38,248
Don't forget. Lotus grows
in marshy water.

666
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:39,416
Yes, sir.

667
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,292
One of my friend says
that a lotus like me...

668
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:43,461
...will have to remain
in marshy water.

669
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:52,846
- Tell me something. How did you know?
- What?

670
00:41:53,763 --> 00:41:56,141
Gayatri Mantra.

671
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:58,768
- Gayatri Mantra?
- Yes. Gayatri Mantra.

672
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,062
How do you know the meaning
of Gayatri Mantra?

673
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:04,274
You can also know it if you
concentrate on your studies.

674
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:06,234
Yes. But...

675
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:09,821
- We have not come to college to study.
- Then?

676
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:15,535
What? Okay!

677
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,830
Concentrate on the studies,
not on me.

678
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:21,124
- Let's go to the library.
- Where is library?

679
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,001
In the college.

680
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:25,045
Now don't ask where is
the college? Let's go.

681
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:27,547
Come. Come on!

682
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,635
What is this?

683
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,262
Library.

684
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:37,766
Library? We dissect frogs there.

685
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:39,601
How will we study here?

686
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:42,520
That is laboratory. This is library.

687
00:42:42,854 --> 00:42:43,938
Let's go!

688
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:49,277
Oh my God!

689
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:51,529
Why is it so silent?

690
00:42:52,113 --> 00:42:53,198
Has somebody died?

691
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,158
- Silence!
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

692
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:56,409
Come! Come on!

693
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:29,943
- My brother Rambo!
- Yes man!

694
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:32,696
Do you know why I am
drinking so much?

695
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,990
You love Dinky!

696
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:39,327
Lust!

697
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:42,288
- I love her!
- Really?

698
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:44,457
- I think she is sexy!
- Yes, man!

699
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,459
Destruction!

700
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:49,546
Destruction!

701
00:43:49,629 --> 00:43:52,632
Great! Rashmi doesn't fall for you.

702
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:55,510
And Dinky is falling for me.

703
00:43:58,054 --> 00:43:59,139
Hi!

704
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,890
Look! Whenever you talk about her...

705
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:03,059
...she appears in front of you.

706
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,145
Now she will come to me.

707
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,397
- Hi!
- Hi!

708
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:10,984
I thought I can't find you anywhere
besides toilet and library.

709
00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:13,695
- What are you reading?
- Book!

710
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:15,613
Love story?

711
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,783
His story. I mean history.

712
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:20,618
Cool! Right now I have come to...

713
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,662
...invite you both for
my birthday party.

714
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:26,291
Saturday night at Rexy club.
It's too sexy!

715
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:31,338
Dinky, 2 months ago you had
celebrated your birthday.

716
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:32,505
What happened?

717
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:37,135
That... that was the birthday
of getting a passport.

718
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:38,303
The real one is now.

719
00:44:39,637 --> 00:44:41,681
- You guys are going to come?
- Yes. Sure.

720
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:43,433
Happy birthday, Dinky!

721
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:45,727
But you know I don't visit
parties and clubs.

722
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:49,481
Because I neither drink
nor can I dance.

723
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,816
Come on!

724
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,152
Show some loyalty towards section C.

725
00:44:54,235 --> 00:44:56,321
All C section students are coming!
You too will have to come!

726
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:57,530
But in section C...

727
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:00,658
He will come. I too will come.

728
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:05,455
But... is nobody else
coming from class A?

729
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:08,792
Oh! Okay! I get it!

730
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:10,794
I had invited her.

731
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:13,922
After countless excuses
she said... I will try.

732
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,591
Yes. Please try.

733
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:18,843
- Okay. I will try.
- Okay.

734
00:45:19,886 --> 00:45:22,972
Okay, guys! Bye! See you!

735
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:24,432
See you there!

736
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:25,642
- Bye!
- Bye!

737
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,356
You go there! I won't go!

738
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:35,652
The more you mix with these people
the better it is for you.

739
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:37,028
It's good for your growth.

740
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:40,073
Every good boy should
see the bad boy's side.

741
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:44,202
Because afterwards he has to
venture in the bad world.

742
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:46,121
So start the training from now only.

743
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:06,016
My profligacy. My craziness.

744
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:10,145
Will find peace, beloved.

745
00:46:18,486 --> 00:46:21,865
My profligacy. My craziness.

746
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,952
Will find peace, beloved.

747
00:46:26,494 --> 00:46:32,167
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

748
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:40,467
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

749
00:47:14,876 --> 00:47:18,546
There is intoxication
and loneliness.

750
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:22,133
There is fervor.

751
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:30,225
Dawn and dusk. All the
time I remember you.

752
00:47:30,308 --> 00:47:33,395
Don't go. Don't go in this state.

753
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:36,731
Dwell me in your eyes.

754
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:39,609
Come. Come.

755
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:42,529
Beloved, hide me.

756
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:46,116
My love. My craziness.

757
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,120
Will find peace, beloved.

758
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:56,084
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

759
00:47:58,461 --> 00:48:04,509
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

760
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:15,061
Oh yeah!

761
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:30,618
The destination is so lovely.

762
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:34,164
You have cast a spell.

763
00:48:34,664 --> 00:48:38,335
There is the fervor of meeting.

764
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:42,213
I see you everywhere.

765
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:45,175
Desires have aroused.

766
00:48:45,258 --> 00:48:49,095
Even thoughts are intoxicated.

767
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:52,182
This love is such.

768
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,768
That now I don't like it anywhere.

769
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:58,480
My desire. My craziness.

770
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:02,233
Will find peace, beloved.

771
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:08,281
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

772
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:16,456
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

773
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:24,673
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

774
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:32,472
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

775
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:39,771
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

776
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:45,276
Stop it!

777
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:47,570
Hey! What are you doing? Leave her!

778
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:50,573
I swear I will call the cops!
I said leave her!

779
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:52,117
- Raju!
- Leave her now!

780
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:54,285
Raju!

781
00:49:56,371 --> 00:49:59,958
Listen! You can call the cops!
They will be helpful to you!

782
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,210
Tomorrow you are going
to have a bad day!

783
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:07,757
Where is your house, Dinky? Tell me.

784
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,846
I don't know. I don't want to
go home. I want to party.

785
00:50:20,061 --> 00:50:21,229
Hi, girls!

786
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:23,189
What's up, man?

787
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:24,482
Hi!

788
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:26,526
Hi!

789
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,654
I am sorry about last night!

790
00:50:31,489 --> 00:50:32,615
I was drunk!

791
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:34,826
Sorry! Please!

792
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:37,871
Friends!

793
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:39,998
We are not friends anymore! Now
I don't want to talk to you!

794
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:44,294
Stop!

795
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:50,216
Where are you going?

796
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:59,309
To get this... grow up!

797
00:51:04,981 --> 00:51:06,107
Last night you were
acting very smugly.

798
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:10,695
Let's do one thing. Try
to enter the class.

799
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:18,745
What? What happened?

800
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:24,250
Do you want to be beaten
in front of everybody...

801
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:25,502
...or alone in the class?

802
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,174
- In the class.
- Let's go.

803
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,051
- Come!
- Let's go!

804
00:51:33,176 --> 00:51:34,302
Come on!

805
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:36,262
- Man!
- He is gone!

806
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,474
Don't hit me too badly!

807
00:51:46,314 --> 00:51:47,691
Wow!

808
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:48,942
Beat me! Beat me!

809
00:51:57,992 --> 00:51:59,119
Oh my God!

810
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:30,984
- Hey!
- Yes!

811
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:34,654
Such a big book?

812
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:39,659
It's not big. Must
be 15-16 years old.

813
00:52:40,618 --> 00:52:41,703
What?

814
00:52:41,953 --> 00:52:46,791
I mean... I was 15-16 years old when
I read a book for the first time.

815
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:48,960
15-16 years old!

816
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:52,339
Could you understand all
this at that time?

817
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:54,924
Yes. I learned everything
when I was 10 years old.

818
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:56,092
I understood.

819
00:52:56,259 --> 00:52:59,346
But... I got the chance when
I was 15-16 years old.

820
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,601
I think you are really interested
in this subject.

821
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:05,769
Yes. To tell you the truth I have...

822
00:53:05,852 --> 00:53:08,104
...always been interested
only in this subject.

823
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:11,232
I want to reach the depth
of this subject.

824
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:17,489
I want to drown in the lips...
I mean the depth of the words.

825
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:22,494
To tell you the truth, I have never
been interested in this subject.

826
00:53:22,577 --> 00:53:27,207
You know. But I think I should
start taking interest.

827
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:29,042
Yes. I am ready to give.

828
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,045
My knowledge.

829
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:39,094
My philosophy is that... when a
person studies these books...

830
00:53:39,135 --> 00:53:41,388
...he should have a practical
experience too.

831
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:44,182
One should be open to every
experience in life.

832
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:48,770
Yeah! And do you know
what my new subject is?

833
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:51,314
- What?
- You.

834
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,776
Jokes apart. I am really impressed.

835
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,570
You read Karl Marx. I mean...

836
00:53:57,862 --> 00:54:01,825
No, jokes apart. I was reading
it just to impress you.

837
00:54:01,908 --> 00:54:03,034
Seriously.

838
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:06,788
- You are too smart!
- I am!

839
00:54:08,164 --> 00:54:10,583
- That's why you like me.
- Who told you that?

840
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:12,460
I know.

841
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:23,680
Smile!

842
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:28,101
You can't do that! It's bad manners!

843
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:29,936
Of course! I can! I am a bad boy!

844
00:54:30,145 --> 00:54:32,564
Rajan, click my snap too.

845
00:54:35,483 --> 00:54:36,568
Battery is low.

846
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,448
The ambience is romantic.

847
00:54:41,531 --> 00:54:43,366
Let's fall in love.

848
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,785
Come, come, come.

849
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:48,580
Come, beloved.

850
00:55:16,107 --> 00:55:17,233
Rashmi!

851
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:22,238
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

852
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:29,245
Happy birthday dear papa!
Happy birthday to you!

853
00:55:30,663 --> 00:55:31,748
I am sorry, papa.

854
00:55:32,582 --> 00:55:35,669
I know you said in the college
and in public life...

855
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,839
...we both will behave like
principal and student...

856
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:41,716
...and not like father and daughter.

857
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:46,137
But today I know... a principal
doesn't need a student...

858
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:48,056
...but a father needs his daughter.

859
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:49,933
Happy birthday, papa!

860
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:52,686
Yes, dear. Come.

861
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:55,689
- So how is everything?
- Good.

862
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:57,941
Tell me. How are your
studies going on?

863
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:01,486
Very good. Is the principal
asking this?

864
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:02,654
Papa is asking this.

865
00:56:02,737 --> 00:56:03,863
- Very good!
- Good!

866
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:07,075
Do you know... this time I am
thinking of studying a new subject.

867
00:56:07,158 --> 00:56:08,993
A new subject? Which one?

868
00:56:09,244 --> 00:56:11,496
Karl Marx's theory of communism.

869
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:16,543
Oh! You and communism! That
sounds interesting!

870
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,171
That guy is interesting!

871
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:21,923
You call Karl Marx as a guy?

872
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:27,554
Papa, not Karl Marx! Rajan!
Rajan Malhotra!

873
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:28,847
Rajan Malhotra?

874
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,765
Yes, papa. Do you know?

875
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:34,019
I always thought him to be
a vagabond and useless guy.

876
00:56:34,936 --> 00:56:36,312
His behavior too is like that.

877
00:56:37,355 --> 00:56:40,275
But... in spite of all the
naughtiness and mischief...

878
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:44,195
...he is the guy who has scored
the highest% in our class.

879
00:56:44,529 --> 00:56:46,364
92%!

880
00:56:46,614 --> 00:56:49,492
- Great! Rashmi!
- Yes.

881
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,828
I would like to meet
that boy. Bring him.

882
00:56:52,662 --> 00:56:54,039
He has a friend in section
C. Bring him too.

883
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:55,915
Okay, papa. He is so cool!

884
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:57,083
Yes! Too much!

885
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:00,086
I think we both got exchanged
in the hospital!

886
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:02,964
What your dad wanted, my dad got it.

887
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:04,549
What my dad wanted, your dad got it.

888
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:07,552
I mean, why can't they be
happy the way we are?

889
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:09,679
I know. They always want to
change us according to them.

890
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:11,306
Hang on! Rashmi! Rashmi!

891
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:13,600
Yes, Rashmi!

892
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:15,393
Listen. I have some work from you.

893
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:16,561
Tell me.

894
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:19,814
Principal has called you and
Raju home this evening.

895
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:24,152
Home? Principal has
called us home? Why?

896
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:27,364
I think he is very impressed
with you both.

897
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:30,075
He is impressed! Okay! Okay!

898
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:31,618
Listen! Another thing!

899
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:34,079
I wanted some help
in some questions.

900
00:57:34,412 --> 00:57:37,374
You want some help in some
questions. Speak loudly!

901
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,876
Rashmi, hang on! Here
the network is low.

902
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:42,003
Hang on! Hang on! She is
asking some questions.

903
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:43,171
You listen to the question.
I will give her the answer.

904
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:07,737
Thank you. Bye.

905
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:08,905
All right.

906
00:58:09,614 --> 00:58:10,824
Oh no! I barely managed to escape.

907
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:12,951
This time you were here.
What will I do next time?

908
00:58:12,992 --> 00:58:15,954
Tell her I don't know.
I will find out.

909
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:18,998
At the most she will think
you don't know the answer.

910
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:21,292
At least you won't give
the wrong answer.

911
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:25,797
Yes. I will do this the
next time. Thank you.

912
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:28,758
Come on. We have to meet the
principal in the evening.

913
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:29,968
Come on!

914
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,267
- Nirmala.
- Yes, sir.

915
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:42,230
Arts faculty second year section
A student Rajan Malhotra...

916
00:58:42,313 --> 00:58:45,233
...and section C student
Raju Malhotra.

917
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:48,653
I want their original admission
forms and files. Immediately.

918
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:50,822
Sorry, sir. It will take some time.

919
00:58:51,322 --> 00:58:52,741
I should get it tomorrow
morning at my home.

920
00:58:52,824 --> 00:58:55,410
Okay. It's a bit urgent. And
please keep it to yourself.

921
00:58:55,493 --> 00:58:56,661
Okay, sir.

922
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:11,426
'Sir, 92%...'

923
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:15,555
'I mean... I can't get
92%, sir. Its 35%.'

924
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:21,061
'Sir, actually the reason of
meeting you is my daddy.'

925
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:22,645
'Daddy?'

926
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:23,813
'Sir, P.K. Malhotra.'

927
00:59:23,897 --> 00:59:25,857
'Sir, he was worried that I might...

928
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,776
...get spoiled with these
C class students.'

929
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:38,286
Principal sir!

930
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,474
You wanted to meet Rajan
Malhotra, didn't you?

931
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:03,436
He is Rajan Malhotra. And
he is Raju Malhotra.

932
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:09,526
Nice to know you... Raju Malhotra...

933
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:10,819
...and Rajan Malhotra.

934
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:13,863
Let's shake hands, my friend.

935
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:24,374
Bye Mr. Awasthi.

936
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:40,098
Dr. Awasthi.

937
01:00:42,892 --> 01:00:44,102
Dr. Awasthi.

938
01:00:46,062 --> 01:00:49,274
- You are thinking something.
- No, no.

939
01:00:50,442 --> 01:00:53,236
You are hiding something, good
fathers don't hide anything...

940
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:54,654
- ...from their children.
- No dear.

941
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:57,824
Papa, I can read your eyes.

942
01:00:58,324 --> 01:01:00,744
As if these are your books
and not my eyes.

943
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:03,455
Really, where was
your concentration?

944
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:07,042
You were watering the cactus.

945
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:10,211
Oh No.

946
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:12,130
Tell me the truth, what
were you thinking?

947
01:01:14,132 --> 01:01:16,051
I was thinking about those two boys.

948
01:01:16,134 --> 01:01:17,510
Really, how did you like those two?

949
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:19,387
They are okay.

950
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:21,806
- Okay or nice?
- Nice.

951
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:23,600
Nice or very nice.

952
01:01:25,685 --> 01:01:27,729
Dear, people are not what
they seem to be...

953
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,732
...and what cannot be seen,
it is not there.

954
01:01:30,815 --> 01:01:32,984
Be careful of those two okay.

955
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:37,489
Papa, I am your daughter my
eyes cannot be deceived.

956
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:39,115
Okay.

957
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:40,617
See you in college sir.

958
01:01:41,284 --> 01:01:44,120
Yes Ms. Rashmi Awasthi,
you may proceed.

959
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:51,836
Pass it, pass it here, here, here.

960
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:08,353
Pass it, pass it here,
here, here. Come on.

961
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:13,566
Okay guys I am out.

962
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:14,818
Take care of him today.

963
01:02:18,613 --> 01:02:19,739
Why did you push me?

964
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,075
Can't you watch where
you are playing?

965
01:02:22,158 --> 01:02:23,284
Shall I show you how
you should play?

966
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:26,204
Cool Raju, you have
thought me enough...

967
01:02:26,287 --> 01:02:28,957
...so that I can show
him how to play.

968
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:32,585
You! You will teach me!
You will teach me!

969
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:34,838
Yeah Rambo, and remember one thing...

970
01:02:36,756 --> 01:02:39,342
...when a player is practicing
his new game...

971
01:02:39,926 --> 01:02:41,052
...don't disturb him.

972
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,890
Did you hear that, come
on get out of here.

973
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:49,394
Yo man, I will be back.

974
01:02:52,355 --> 01:02:55,150
So my brave man, you
learn very fast.

975
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:57,610
Keep it up.

976
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:05,785
- May we come in sir?
- Yeah, come in.

977
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:14,669
Sir if you are busy, then we
will come back later sir.

978
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:16,338
Yes sir, tomorrow, the day
after, or even later.

979
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:17,881
I said, come.

980
01:03:21,551 --> 01:03:22,761
Sir, is there something
important sir.

981
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,722
Something like that, take a seat.

982
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:36,316
I was very pleased to see
your AC combination.

983
01:03:38,276 --> 01:03:45,450
- AC?
- A means you and C means you.

984
01:03:46,117 --> 01:03:48,578
No sir, I am in the A section.

985
01:03:49,537 --> 01:03:53,541
You are in C section, but
you answer like A section.

986
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:57,504
Actually sir, he teaches
me all that.

987
01:03:57,587 --> 01:03:58,630
He is very helpful.

988
01:03:59,005 --> 01:04:01,883
But Mr. A, can you
help me with my PC.

989
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:07,180
There is a CD of modern education,
it is not running.

990
01:04:07,263 --> 01:04:08,348
Oh sure, give it to me.

991
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:13,478
Go into the programs of the windows
and break the code of the CD...

992
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,355
...then it starts running itself.

993
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:17,607
I have thought him that.

994
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:19,651
It is an Indian software.

995
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:27,325
This, this.

996
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:37,627
Great.

997
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:41,840
I cannot send this MMS
from my mobile...

998
01:04:41,923 --> 01:04:44,759
...it is about the ragging
case in Haryana...

999
01:04:44,843 --> 01:04:47,137
Sir, this is that Amita Gupta
case I will show it to you.

1000
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:49,931
Go into the menu, scroll down...

1001
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:53,977
...and here is your MMS sir.

1002
01:04:56,354 --> 01:04:57,981
- It's nice isn't it sir.
- Yeah.

1003
01:04:59,524 --> 01:05:04,446
Surprising, I thought that you will
solve the computer problem...

1004
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:06,448
...and you will go for the mobile.

1005
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:09,993
But your habits seem
to have changed.

1006
01:05:10,535 --> 01:05:12,662
Sir, It's out habit to teach
each other all this.

1007
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:14,706
We always believe in exchange...

1008
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:18,793
I mean we believe in skill exchange.

1009
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:19,961
Something happened.

1010
01:05:20,045 --> 01:05:22,047
No sir, I have brought him
a new pair of shoes.

1011
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:24,174
Yes sir, whenever
he buys new shoes...

1012
01:05:24,257 --> 01:05:26,301
...I always have to bear...
I mean wear it

1013
01:05:29,637 --> 01:05:31,473
- Come on.
- Bye-bye sir.

1014
01:05:31,514 --> 01:05:32,640
Bye sir.

1015
01:05:34,517 --> 01:05:37,645
Rajan... thanks.

1016
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:40,106
My pleasure sir.

1017
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:41,274
Our pleasure sir.

1018
01:05:41,816 --> 01:05:44,986
You will get many more pleasures
like this, in near future.

1019
01:05:54,496 --> 01:05:55,872
I feel like eating something.

1020
01:05:57,624 --> 01:05:59,584
We are in such grave trouble and
you are thinking about food.

1021
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:01,586
I want to take an oath... oath...

1022
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,963
...that we will never get entrapped
in problems like this again.

1023
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:09,135
Think about it, you will never lie.

1024
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:10,970
Are you sure.

1025
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,223
Actually speaking, I am not sure.

1026
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:16,267
To tell you the truth, I am
enjoying this role change a lot.

1027
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:20,522
What a life.

1028
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:27,529
'I was very pleased to see
your AC combination.'

1029
01:06:31,908 --> 01:06:37,122
'A means you and C means you, AC.'

1030
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,510
- Hi Humdum.
- Say Gumnam.

1031
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:52,971
Tomorrow is a Sunday,
and she has agreed.

1032
01:06:53,054 --> 01:06:54,639
- Who?
- Rashmi, who else.

1033
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:55,849
Agreed for what?

1034
01:06:55,932 --> 01:06:58,184
To go on a long drive, I will
say and she will smile.

1035
01:06:58,893 --> 01:07:01,855
- I will read out a poetry and...
- She will listen to you.

1036
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:04,274
She likes to hear to
Tennyson's poetry.

1037
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:07,986
I know only Anand Bakshi
and Samir's songs.

1038
01:07:09,362 --> 01:07:11,406
- Are you coming?
- No, I am not coming.

1039
01:07:11,489 --> 01:07:15,452
Love can be confirmed only
when you sing songs.

1040
01:07:15,535 --> 01:07:18,038
Try and adopt my style, and
Dinky will fall for you.

1041
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:21,166
- I am not filmy.
- Then become one.

1042
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:24,044
Nowadays every person
is filmy, understood.

1043
01:07:53,198 --> 01:07:54,282
- Hello
- Hi.

1044
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,160
- Did I disturb you?
- Yes you did.

1045
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:01,623
You study the entire day,
but you score just 35%.

1046
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:03,667
You are a 100% failure.

1047
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,918
Shall we talk about something else?

1048
01:08:07,003 --> 01:08:08,171
It is raining outside.

1049
01:08:09,798 --> 01:08:13,051
Strange isn't it, it is raining
in the rainy season too.

1050
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:23,395
Come out of the house.

1051
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:26,481
Come out.

1052
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:32,821
Touch the rain drops, and
listen to its music.

1053
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:36,991
How does it feel?

1054
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:39,119
It feels strange.

1055
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:42,372
And what do you call this feeling?

1056
01:08:42,455 --> 01:08:44,124
What? What do you call it?

1057
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:47,711
Love. I love you.

1058
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:53,925
Hello.

1059
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:58,972
It is the climate of love,
come and fall in love.

1060
01:08:59,639 --> 01:09:04,185
Come, come, come my beloved come.

1061
01:09:06,062 --> 01:09:13,486
There is nothing else
in this heart.

1062
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:30,170
It is the climate of love,
come and fall in love.

1063
01:09:30,253 --> 01:09:34,007
Come, come, come my beloved come.

1064
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:37,969
It is the climate of love,
come and fall in love.

1065
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:41,556
Come, come, come my beloved come.

1066
01:09:41,639 --> 01:09:47,937
Your hopes.

1067
01:09:48,855 --> 01:09:56,237
Your intoxication.

1068
01:09:57,405 --> 01:10:02,494
There is nothing else
in this heart.

1069
01:10:05,413 --> 01:10:11,878
There is nothing else
in this heart.

1070
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:26,351
My heartbeat indicates.

1071
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:33,441
You are my love, you are my
beloved, you are my life.

1072
01:10:34,526 --> 01:10:37,821
My heartbeat indicates.

1073
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:44,869
You are my dream, you the desire
of my impatient heart.

1074
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:53,503
You are my world, every
saga starts with you.

1075
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:11,354
You are immersed in me.

1076
01:11:12,355 --> 01:11:19,154
Your desires, your feelings
are the essence of my life.

1077
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:22,741
I crave for you.

1078
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:27,746
I ask for you in my prayers
from the Lord.

1079
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:29,998
You are my only desire.

1080
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:34,210
You are my insanity.

1081
01:11:34,961 --> 01:11:38,006
I have fallen in love with you.

1082
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:42,510
It is the climate of love,
come and fall in love.

1083
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:46,264
Come, come, come my beloved come.

1084
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:49,893
It is the climate of love,
come and fall in love.

1085
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:53,813
Come, come, come my beloved come.

1086
01:11:54,814 --> 01:12:02,072
There is nothing else
in this heart.

1087
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:09,371
There is nothing else
in this heart.

1088
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:34,229
My daughter who used
to befriends books...

1089
01:12:34,312 --> 01:12:35,855
...today she is befriending flowers.

1090
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:37,607
Such a change.

1091
01:12:40,568 --> 01:12:44,197
Look dear, I can understand
your emotions very well.

1092
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:50,912
But what if the one you love,
turns out to be a deceit.

1093
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:55,166
Girls those are blind,
only they are deceived.

1094
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:59,587
Even those dear, who
close their eyes.

1095
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:04,300
You are right papa, but
I have closed my eyes...

1096
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:05,552
...after thinking it through.

1097
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:10,890
God bless you.

1098
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:17,355
Awasthi, you will have
to open her eyes.

1099
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:21,317
My dears, the new experiment
that I have done...

1100
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:24,612
...by dividing the classes
in sections.

1101
01:13:25,363 --> 01:13:26,489
I have been observing that...

1102
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:27,657
...it has been bearing new fruits.

1103
01:13:28,533 --> 01:13:29,659
A lot of things have changed.

1104
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:31,745
Students have changed too.

1105
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:34,873
There are some students
in section C...

1106
01:13:34,956 --> 01:13:36,791
...that deserve section A.

1107
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:39,044
And there are some students
in section A...

1108
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:41,504
...that deserve section C.

1109
01:13:42,088 --> 01:13:44,299
And that's why, for everyone
revaluation...

1110
01:13:44,382 --> 01:13:46,551
...it is necessary to
have another exam.

1111
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:50,472
An interim exam, so
that as of today...

1112
01:13:50,555 --> 01:13:52,724
...we will know that
who deserves what.

1113
01:13:53,475 --> 01:13:54,601
Correct.

1114
01:13:54,684 --> 01:13:59,147
So students, get ready for new
exams on the 10th of September.

1115
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:02,984
Clap please.

1116
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:04,235
Thank you.

1117
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:11,618
I don't care about the world.

1118
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:14,871
What if Rashmi leaves me?

1119
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:18,249
That's true, now I will have
to leave Dinky's class...

1120
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,542
...and will have to sit in class A.

1121
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:22,170
Along with the exams, It is
the question of our love too.

1122
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:27,634
Hi Rajan, aren't you happy
about the re-examination?

1123
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:32,972
You... why are the both of you upset.

1124
01:14:34,182 --> 01:14:37,477
See, see even Rashmi is saying
exactly what I was.

1125
01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:40,438
When did you say that?
I was saying that.

1126
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:44,567
Actually Rashmi, he is a bit upset.

1127
01:14:45,735 --> 01:14:47,654
He was thinking that, if
he scores less marks...

1128
01:14:47,737 --> 01:14:52,075
...then you will, I mean...

1129
01:14:55,036 --> 01:14:58,289
Every girl dreams that, his
partner should be handsome...

1130
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:03,211
...dashing, a bit intelligent,
and that's all.

1131
01:15:03,378 --> 01:15:04,754
That's what I want.

1132
01:15:05,547 --> 01:15:07,799
Awasthi sir has complete
faith on the both of you.

1133
01:15:07,882 --> 01:15:08,967
Really.

1134
01:15:18,309 --> 01:15:21,229
Did you hear, what Rashmi said?

1135
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:27,193
Yes, she wants a first class,
95% scoring life partner.

1136
01:15:30,488 --> 01:15:32,741
That means I lost in
the battle of love.

1137
01:15:33,533 --> 01:15:36,870
Hundred percent, and not only
you even I have lost.

1138
01:15:37,787 --> 01:15:39,956
Bringing Dinky from 35% to 75%...

1139
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,708
...will take me my entire life time.

1140
01:15:42,959 --> 01:15:45,378
But it is necessary, not for her...

1141
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:48,131
...it is necessary for the
peace of my own mind.

1142
01:15:48,214 --> 01:15:50,216
That I make her a serious
student too.

1143
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:56,723
Then go, get some peace
of mind and let me study.

1144
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,365
Come on Dinky, let us study.

1145
01:16:15,283 --> 01:16:21,331
What is the hurry we still
have the entire night.

1146
01:16:21,414 --> 01:16:22,707
That's why there is a hurry...

1147
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:25,043
...I don't want to spend the
entire night at your home.

1148
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:28,129
Okay, you can leave
tomorrow morning.

1149
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:32,175
What? Look Dinky I don't
like such jokes.

1150
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:33,927
Come on, let's study.

1151
01:16:35,053 --> 01:16:38,473
Come on, today I will teach
you a new way of studying.

1152
01:16:39,057 --> 01:16:42,268
- A new way?
- Yes, it is very easy.

1153
01:16:43,311 --> 01:16:44,813
It is called, SS.

1154
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,857
SS, you mean serious studies right

1155
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:53,613
- Strip study.
- What?

1156
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:59,869
Come on, I will ask
you a few questions.

1157
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:04,624
And for every question,
I will strip something.

1158
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:09,129
Dinky, this is a very
dangerous way to study.

1159
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:12,799
I know, that's why I have
thought of this way.

1160
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:19,848
Okay the first question,
the truth is often...

1161
01:17:19,931 --> 01:17:22,183
...a terrible weapon of destruction.

1162
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:26,229
- Who said that?
- Alfred Adler.

1163
01:17:26,312 --> 01:17:27,397
Right.

1164
01:17:40,785 --> 01:17:44,748
Next question, there is
a saying that a man...

1165
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:48,251
...should love his neighbor
as himself...

1166
01:17:48,918 --> 01:17:52,172
...and in a few hundred years,
it should become...

1167
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,591
...as natural, as breathing itself.

1168
01:17:55,467 --> 01:18:00,555
- Who said that?
- Alfred Adler.

1169
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:02,515
Correct.

1170
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:12,776
Okay, next question.

1171
01:18:13,985 --> 01:18:18,073
Love in itself, in the form
of longing and depreciation...

1172
01:18:18,156 --> 01:18:22,619
...lowers the self regard.
Who said this?

1173
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,705
Alfred... Alfred.

1174
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:33,797
Alfred Hitchcock.

1175
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:36,800
Sorry, wrong answer.

1176
01:18:36,966 --> 01:18:38,593
No, no, no wait, wait.

1177
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:41,304
John Grey, John Grey,
John Grey, John Grey.

1178
01:18:42,013 --> 01:18:43,556
Oops wrong answer.

1179
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,351
Stop, stop, stop I know, I know this

1180
01:18:47,268 --> 01:18:49,562
Jung, Karl Gustak Jung.

1181
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:51,731
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wrong answer.

1182
01:18:52,732 --> 01:18:56,027
- No.
- Sorry, next time.

1183
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:10,542
Best of luck brother.

1184
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:16,464
No matter how much you study...

1185
01:19:16,506 --> 01:19:17,632
...you are not going to pass.

1186
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,595
'Every girl dreams that, his
partner should be handsome...

1187
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:26,975
...dashing, a bit intelligent,
and that's all.'

1188
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:28,935
'That's what I want.'

1189
01:19:44,826 --> 01:19:46,870
Whose empty seat is that?

1190
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:48,747
Rajan Malhotra.

1191
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:10,935
- You are not writing the exams.
- No.

1192
01:20:11,686 --> 01:20:16,107
All the questions and it's answers,
you have it don't you.

1193
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:22,197
Yes, but giving an incomplete
answer to any question...

1194
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,490
...is like making a fool of yourself.

1195
01:20:24,157 --> 01:20:26,701
On the right time, I will give the
complete answer to all the questions.

1196
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:29,829
If you want to give me something...
...then give me another chance.

1197
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:36,002
Okay, I give you another chance.

1198
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:52,977
In today's meeting, we want
to give you all a good news.

1199
01:20:53,478 --> 01:20:57,565
And that is after 5 years, our
college will take part...

1200
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:02,195
...in the inter-college
youth festival.

1201
01:21:02,904 --> 01:21:04,239
Congratulations.

01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:54,205
Wear the cap, wear the cap.

1212
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:57,125
He is not Himesh Reshamiyan,
he is Himesh Chandra.

1213
01:21:59,711 --> 01:22:02,881
And now comes the dance competition.

And now for the quiz competition.

1218
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:45,840
In which you need brain, brilliance
and knowledge...

1219
01:22:45,924 --> 01:22:48,468
...instead of your heart.

1220
01:22:49,052 --> 01:22:51,846
And that is, Rajan Malhotra.

1221
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:54,766
Give him a big hand.

1222
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:57,936
Give him a big hand.

1223
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:13,576
All the best my dear.

1224
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:31,052
That old man Awasthi insulted
our Rambo a lot.

1225
01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:33,805
Our Rambo is a dancing champion...

1226
01:23:33,888 --> 01:23:38,143
...and whom did he select,
that idiot Raju Malhotra.

1227
01:23:38,226 --> 01:23:40,270
Malhotra, I can't take it.

1228
01:23:40,353 --> 01:23:42,689
Malhotra, even I have to settle
an old score with him.

1229
01:23:42,772 --> 01:23:45,275
That's a good idea, now only...

1230
01:23:45,358 --> 01:23:47,569
...you can spread this destruction.

1231
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:50,655
After all I am an ex-best student.

1232
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:22,247
Doctor sir, how is Awasthi sir?

1233
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:25,750
He is still unconscious,
otherwise he is fine.

1234
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:28,712
Look, visiting hours are over.

1235
01:25:28,795 --> 01:25:29,963
You can leave now.

1236
01:25:30,046 --> 01:25:32,716
Okay sir, then we will
take Rashmi along too.

1237
01:25:32,799 --> 01:25:34,926
No, it is necessary for
one relative to say back.

1238
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:38,096
I think it well be better for
her daughter to stay back.

1239
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:40,348
- Daughter
- What did you say?

1240
01:25:40,432 --> 01:25:42,058
Rashmi is his daughter.

1241
01:25:42,142 --> 01:25:45,311
Yes, it is written Rashmi
Awasthi on the form.

1242
01:25:45,395 --> 01:25:46,855
Are you sure doctor?

1243
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:50,817
I am telling you, please
you can leave.

1244
01:26:26,144 --> 01:26:30,065
Now just drink milk and study,
and forget everything else.

1245
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:33,318
That Rashmi Awasthi's
daughter fooled us.

1246
01:26:33,401 --> 01:26:35,612
Even you fooled her by posing
as an A class student.

1247
01:26:35,695 --> 01:26:39,282
But I am an A class student, I am.

1248
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:45,663
Look, Awasthi sir is a nice man.

1249
01:26:45,705 --> 01:26:47,207
There is only one thing left to do.

1250
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:48,583
Go and meet him in the evening...

1251
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:50,043
...and tell him the truth.

1252
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:54,964
- What?
- That we have done a very big fraud.

1253
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:59,094
And sir, we cannot take
part in this competition.

1254
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:03,890
Truth is the only way to
solve a grave problem.

1255
01:27:13,108 --> 01:27:14,859
Sir, we want to tell you something.

1256
01:27:17,862 --> 01:27:22,575
Sir, we cannot take part
in this competition.

1257
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,746
You should not take part.

1258
01:27:28,289 --> 01:27:31,292
The truth that you want
to tell me now...

1259
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:33,837
...I know about the truth
long back, yes.

1260
01:27:34,838 --> 01:27:36,506
You played the game
of changing class...

1261
01:27:36,589 --> 01:27:38,008
...so I played the game of faith!

1262
01:27:38,049 --> 01:27:40,677
Even though I knew
about your truth...

1263
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,847
...I sent your name for the
inter-collegiate competition.

1264
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:45,098
Do you know why?

1265
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:50,061
If you give a responsible job
to a weak student with faith...

1266
01:27:50,145 --> 01:27:54,566
...he can see his strength
in that faith!

1267
01:27:55,358 --> 01:27:57,986
He can win! He can win
even though he losses!

1268
01:27:58,695 --> 01:28:00,989
No, but the both of you.

1269
01:28:01,072 --> 01:28:03,700
The both of you have
lost from yourself.

1270
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:08,329
And how dare you come here
and ask for forgiveness!

1271
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:11,875
By thrashing Dinesh you
have acted like goons...

1272
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:13,418
...and not like good boys!

1273
01:28:14,377 --> 01:28:16,046
I could have lodged a complaint
against them...

1274
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:17,505
...with the police, what was
the need for you to go?

1275
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:20,300
Because you had a selfish
purpose in it.

1276
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:24,596
You wanted to impress
me, my daughter.

1277
01:28:25,847 --> 01:28:29,059
Rashmi, whom you love... yes!

1278
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:30,977
You can't even tell the truth
to the one you love!

1279
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:33,021
You know why?

1280
01:28:34,064 --> 01:28:35,357
Because you are a coward, gutless.

1281
01:28:37,567 --> 01:28:38,693
Shameful.

1282
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,698
I am disappointed.

1283
01:28:44,574 --> 01:28:46,576
I am ashamed of both of you

1284
01:28:46,659 --> 01:28:48,036
- But sir...
- I don't want to hear anything!

1285
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:49,954
Just leave me and get lost!

1286
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:53,124
You have hurt my faith, get lost!

1287
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:29,494
- Rashmi.
- Don't touch me!

1288
01:29:31,204 --> 01:29:33,373
Rashmi, I know you
are angry with me.

1289
01:29:33,456 --> 01:29:35,875
I know that I have made
a mistake, I have lied.

1290
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,587
But if I have lied, then
you have lied to me too.

1291
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:42,674
By hiding that you are principle
Awasthi's daughter.

1292
01:29:44,175 --> 01:29:46,052
There is a limit of
being shameless Raju.

1293
01:29:47,303 --> 01:29:52,600
But it's obvious, that you
don't know that limit.

1294
01:29:54,269 --> 01:29:56,062
Whether papa forgives you or not...

1295
01:29:56,146 --> 01:29:58,857
...I can never forgive you.

1296
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,276
Do you love me or my percentage?

1297
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:05,905
The one I used to love,
I didn't know him.

1298
01:30:07,741 --> 01:30:11,661
But today the one I hate, he
is a hundred percent liar...

1299
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:14,831
...and a selfish person.

1300
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:21,713
Okay, today this selfish man will
go away from your life forever.

1301
01:30:22,213 --> 01:30:27,302
But remember one thing,
whatever I did...

1302
01:30:27,385 --> 01:30:33,266
...I did it because, I have
always loved you 100%.

1303
01:30:45,278 --> 01:30:47,113
Sir, two boys that you have chosen...

1304
01:30:47,197 --> 01:30:48,782
...they are completely useless.

1305
01:30:48,865 --> 01:30:50,700
They will surely fail.

1306
01:30:50,742 --> 01:30:53,036
Instead of them, send
Rambo and Rashmi.

1307
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:55,914
No, send both of them.

1308
01:30:56,623 --> 01:30:58,708
Let them learn their own lesson.

1309
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:00,669
They have brought this situation
upon themselves...

1310
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:02,128
...let them face the consequences.

1311
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:05,340
Quiz.

1312
01:31:08,176 --> 01:31:10,387
Okay, I will ask you
the first question.

1313
01:31:11,554 --> 01:31:13,181
Who is the most insane person?

1314
01:31:14,683 --> 01:31:21,731
You have four options A, you
who is going to take part.

1315
01:31:24,234 --> 01:31:28,029
B, me because I am listening
to such foolish things.

1316
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:31,950
- C, that principle who is sending you there.
- Papa, please.

1317
01:31:32,033 --> 01:31:33,451
Just a minute.

1318
01:31:35,787 --> 01:31:40,458
And D, the people who are
organizing this quiz competition.

1319
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:55,432
Your son is a total loss
in dance, a total loss.

1320
01:31:56,016 --> 01:31:58,685
- In dance, I am...
- Please don't talk like that.

1321
01:31:58,768 --> 01:32:00,395
Then what else shall I do,
what else shall I do?

1322
01:32:00,478 --> 01:32:02,522
He wants to take part
in a dance competition.

1323
01:32:02,605 --> 01:32:04,274
If a lizard enters his pants then,
he will dance like this.

1324
01:32:04,357 --> 01:32:05,859
Like this.

1325
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:09,946
Oh Lord, this Prabhu Deva had
to take birth in this house.

1326
01:32:09,988 --> 01:32:12,699
You never even danced
in Ganpati or Dandia.

1327
01:32:12,782 --> 01:32:13,908
At least my child is trying.

1328
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:15,326
He is trying.

1329
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,746
You wanted a son like me,
now that I am trying...

1330
01:32:17,829 --> 01:32:19,330
You are trying...

1331
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:34,971
You hurt him, didn't you.

1332
01:32:37,223 --> 01:32:41,186
Okay, if we are destined
to win, then we will win.

1333
01:32:41,269 --> 01:32:43,146
But we will not lose
hope till the last.

1334
01:32:45,357 --> 01:32:48,068
I say that you can win
this dance competition.

1335
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:50,070
You know, you once told me that
recognize your abilities...

1336
01:32:50,153 --> 01:32:51,821
...understand your weakness...

1337
01:32:51,905 --> 01:32:53,865
...and just go for it
with your willpower.

1338
01:32:54,616 --> 01:32:57,369
I know Dinky, but practically
I don't have much time...

1339
01:32:57,452 --> 01:33:00,497
- ...and in so less time we...
- Look, for the next 10 days...

1340
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:05,210
...I will make you do dance
rehearsals continuously.

1341
01:33:05,877 --> 01:33:08,171
And I believe that you can do it.

1342
01:33:10,131 --> 01:33:12,425
We don't have any other
way then trying.

1343
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:14,427
Let's do it Raju.

1344
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,139
This is a game of life and
death, let's play it.

1345
01:33:18,223 --> 01:33:19,391
Let's do it.

1346
01:33:50,046 --> 01:33:52,549
I will turn this youth festival
in such an event...

1347
01:33:52,632 --> 01:33:55,343
...that Awasthi and his
pupil will remember it.

1348
01:34:01,558 --> 01:34:04,561
The sorrows of my heart.

1349
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:11,443
The sorrows of my mind.

1350
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:18,199
The sorrows of my desires.

1351
01:34:20,785 --> 01:34:24,289
I want to tell you.

1352
01:34:28,293 --> 01:34:31,755
I want to tell you.

1353
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,469
I want to tell you.

1354
01:34:41,598 --> 01:34:44,142
Welcome to inter-collegiate
youth festival.

1355
01:34:44,225 --> 01:34:47,937
The next competition is music
and dance competition.

1356
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:59,240
We don't want to say anything
about the current condition...

1357
01:34:59,324 --> 01:35:01,326
...of our college, whatever
you want to ask...

1358
01:35:01,409 --> 01:35:03,536
...you can ask Dr. Awasthi.

1359
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:05,497
And the courage that our children
have shown today...

1360
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:09,292
...that proves that, they are
worthy of this competition.

1361
01:35:10,001 --> 01:35:13,296
Enough, enough, enough, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

1362
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:17,926
And now comes the turn on,
from BSS college...

1363
01:35:18,009 --> 01:35:20,178
...Mr. Raju Malhotra.

1364
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:29,562
No one knows when this
pain will stop.

1365
01:35:29,646 --> 01:35:37,112
My insanity says, I ask only
for you in my every prayer.

1366
01:35:37,195 --> 01:35:41,032
My day does not conclude
without seeing you.

1367
01:35:41,116 --> 01:35:43,034
My day does not conclude.

1368
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:46,496
I don't have any control
on my desires anymore.

1369
01:35:46,579 --> 01:35:48,456
I don't have any control

1370
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:53,503
The sorrows of my heart.

1371
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:59,134
The sorrows of my mind.

1372
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:05,098
The sorrows of my desires.

1373
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:12,272
I want to tell you.

1374
01:36:13,898 --> 01:36:17,527
I want to tell you.

1375
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:40,717
Hurray! Hurray!

1376
01:36:41,551 --> 01:36:42,761
Hurray! Hurray!

1377
01:36:43,511 --> 01:36:44,763
Hip, Hip Hurray!

1378
01:36:45,597 --> 01:36:46,723
Hurray! Hurray!

1379
01:36:46,806 --> 01:36:48,641
Hip, Hip Hurray!

1380
01:36:59,277 --> 01:37:03,531
The sorrows of my heart.

1381
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:08,995
The sorrows of my mind.

1382
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:15,168
The sorrows of my desires.

1383
01:37:18,421 --> 01:37:22,092
I want to tell you.

1384
01:37:24,177 --> 01:37:28,306
I want to tell you.

1385
01:37:29,766 --> 01:37:33,603
I want to tell you.

1386
01:37:34,521 --> 01:37:37,732
And the winner is Raju Malhotra.

1387
01:37:54,207 --> 01:37:55,417
I won!

1388
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,584

...Bharat Bhagya Vidhata'.

1472
01:44:08,665 --> 01:44:12,669
What is the meaning of 'Bharat
Bhagya Vidhata'?

1473
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:17,757
You can give the answer
by keeping seated too.

1474
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:21,302
Sir I have stood up for the
national anthem and not for you.

1475
01:44:26,057 --> 01:44:28,309
Sir, it means the constructer
of the fate of India.

1476
01:44:28,393 --> 01:44:31,312
Wonderful answer, wonderful answer.

...discover the third law of motion?

1483
01:45:05,805 --> 01:45:07,182
Listen to the question carefully.

1484
01:45:07,599 --> 01:45:09,642
In which year did Alfred Einstein...

1485
01:45:09,684 --> 01:45:11,936

1492
01:45:39,381 --> 01:45:42,634
It's a tie breaker question,
go for it guys.

1493
01:45:45,136 --> 01:45:46,388
BSS college.

BSS college your time
is running out.

1500
01:46:44,446 --> 01:46:49,075
A it is Newton, and
B not attraction.

1501
01:46:49,659 --> 01:46:53,747
Sir, this is a trick question,
the law of motion...

1502
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:57,042
...was discovered by Newton
and not Einstein.

1503
01:47:05,383 --> 01:47:07,302
That was a tie breaking answer
to the tie breaking question...

1504
01:47:07,385 --> 01:47:09,137
...and the answer is correct.

1505
01:47:19,981 --> 01:47:22,317

1507
01:47:29,282 --> 01:47:30,575
Yeah!

1508
01:47:36,873 --> 01:47:38,583
And with that, the winner of
today's quiz contest is...

1509
01:47:38,667 --> 01:47:41,294
...BSS college's Mr. Rajan Malhotra.

1510
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:51,054
And the champions trophy of the
inter-college youth festival...

1511
01:47:51,096 --> 01:47:53,598
...goes to BSS college.

1512
01:48:09,823 --> 01:48:11,074
We have done it.

1513
01:48:22,377 --> 01:48:29,050
We have deceived and lied to all
of you to win this trophy.

1514
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:35,306
You know it all sir, don't you.

1515
01:48:36,975 --> 01:48:39,185
I am Raju and he is Rajan.

1516
01:48:40,645 --> 01:48:44,566
Yes, with the mix up in the
college our sections changed.

1517
01:48:45,316 --> 01:48:47,694
Our names and our deeds changed.

1518
01:48:48,987 --> 01:48:50,405
And when did we start changing...

1519
01:48:50,488 --> 01:48:52,657
...we never realized that.

1520
01:48:54,034 --> 01:48:58,747
The truth is that, neither us
nor our parents believed that...

1521
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:01,541
...we are capable of it.

1522
01:49:05,587 --> 01:49:10,425
But we can do something, we
can change and we can win.

1523
01:49:12,927 --> 01:49:17,098
Only one person believed that,
just one person.

1524
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:21,686
Our principle Mr. Awasthi,
who supported us...

1525
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:25,148
...and then challenged us.

1526
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:27,609
Thank you Awasthi sir, thank you.

1527
01:49:27,692 --> 01:49:29,402
That you gave us this challenge.

1528
01:49:29,486 --> 01:49:34,282
If you want you can rusticate
us from this college.

1529
01:49:37,952 --> 01:49:39,954
Because now we attained
our trophies.

1530
01:49:40,955 --> 01:49:45,377
We can see out victory, in
the eyes of our parents.

1531
01:49:50,423 --> 01:49:52,258
In the tears of joy of my sister.

1532
01:49:57,722 --> 01:49:59,307
In Mr. Awasthi's faith.

1533
01:50:41,975 --> 01:50:47,272
Friends, there is a Raju
and a Rajan in all of us.

1534
01:50:48,231 --> 01:50:50,400
There is nothing like
good boy or bad boy.

1535
01:50:50,442 --> 01:50:54,362
They are all smart boys, all
colleges should not have...

1536
01:50:54,404 --> 01:50:57,490
...such brass and copper trophies...

1537
01:50:57,532 --> 01:51:01,244
...but such live trophies.

1538
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:03,747
Like the ones that I have.

1539
01:51:04,914 --> 01:51:07,584
And not just one, but two
like the ones that I have.

1540
01:51:59,636 --> 01:52:03,473
My profligacy. My craziness.

1541
01:52:03,556 --> 01:52:07,811
Will find peace, beloved.

1542
01:52:15,819 --> 01:52:19,364
My profligacy. My craziness.

1543
01:52:19,447 --> 01:52:23,493
Will feel peaceful, beloved.

1544
01:52:23,576 --> 01:52:29,749
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

1545
01:52:31,334 --> 01:52:38,049
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

1546
01:53:12,167 --> 01:53:15,712
There is intoxication
and loneliness.

1547
01:53:15,795 --> 01:53:19,758
There is fervor.

1548
01:53:19,799 --> 01:53:27,682
Dawn and dusk. All the
time I remember you.

1549
01:53:27,766 --> 01:53:30,894
Don't go. Don't go in this state.

1550
01:53:30,977 --> 01:53:34,147
Dwell me in your eyes.

1551
01:53:34,230 --> 01:53:36,524
Come. Come.

1552
01:53:36,608 --> 01:53:39,611
Beloved, hide me.

1553
01:53:39,694 --> 01:53:43,490
My love. My craziness.

1554
01:53:43,531 --> 01:53:47,577
Will find peace, beloved.

1555
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:54,042
