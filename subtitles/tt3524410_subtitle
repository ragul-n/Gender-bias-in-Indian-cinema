2
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:21,029
- How do you feel?
- Fine, fine.

3
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:24,168
I'll feel better when the match starts.

4
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,263
Spoken like a true hero,
Akiva Israelovitch.

5
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,441
The test results are excellent.
Don't worry.

6
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:35,077
You have the heart of a cosmonaut.
You'll live to 120.

7
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:39,841
I prepared your case history.
Don't forget it.

8
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:46,390
And this, too.

9
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:49,720
Always keep some on you.

10
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,491
I don't think you'll need it.

11
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:55,135
- Anton, you promised you'd come.
- They refused my exit visa request.

12
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,757
Where are they?
I don't understand.

13
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,527
Moscow said they'd be on this flight.

14
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,129
What's going on?

15
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:37,339
They're going to reconstruct the game
you won against him in 1969.

16
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:39,202
You're lazy, you know.

17
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:41,175
Talented but lazy.

18
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:43,647
Go ahead and beat me, then.

19
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:45,082
Queen to G7.

20
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:48,712
If the rook takes B3,
the black bishop takes the pawn on C4.

21
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:51,049
Knight then takes
the bishop, naturally.

22
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:54,623
And black pushes the rook to G10.

23
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:56,424
It's over.

24
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,464
The whites have had it.

25
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:05,095
If you want to beat your opponent,
study the games he lost.

26
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,372
- Tac-Tac.
- Excuse me.

27
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:11,069
Anastase lganovitch,
what are you doing here?

28
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:13,543
You've been in Geneva
for half an hour.

29
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:16,678
Then let's get off this plane.
What are we waiting for?

30
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:29,820
They're here.

31
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,999
- Heller, his cardiologist?
- No.

32
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:37,635
I was right.

33
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:42,503
Liebskind isn't sick. This heart attack
story is all propaganda.

34
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:45,338
Your information is crap.

35
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:47,703
My information is good.

36
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:52,275
You think Tac-Tac is here
because of his skill as a chess player?

37
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,681
- How many threatening letters?
- Twelve.

38
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:57,620
Two are death threats.
All anonymous, as usual.

39
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:00,022
Pavius, I have the contract.

40
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:03,026
I already said no twice.

41
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:07,333
Three days' work, you pay off
your debts and you're set for life.

42
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:09,161
I won't do it.

43
00:03:09,903 --> 00:03:11,700
You know how much you owe me?

44
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:14,205
If you want money,
give me something to sell.

45
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:17,567
Listen to me, Foldes.
Fromm is Fromm.

46
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:20,542
He's a professional chess player.

47
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:23,249
Have him play against
100 or 1,000 opponents...

48
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:26,113
blindfolded on a pillar
at the bottom of the ocean...

49
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:30,086
<i>but they have to play me...</i>

50
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:32,788
not a machine with my name on it.

51
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:34,493
Is that clear?

52
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:37,530
I'm going to town.

53
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:21,271
Where's the bathroom?

54
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:23,170
End of the hall, on the right.

55
00:05:57,804 --> 00:05:59,601
You weren't followed?

56
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:00,900
Not a chance.

57
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:03,841
- Who's your man in our group?
- Nobody.

58
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:05,434
I don't believe you.

59
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:06,603
Good for you.

60
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,875
Opportunist scum.

61
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:13,920
We can't all be dissident superstars.

62
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:17,085
How's our hero?

63
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,192
Can he travel
without his cardiologist now?

64
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:22,954
He doesn't need a cardiologist.

65
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:25,625
He'll put you to shame, my boy.

66
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:28,300
Stop.
You know I'm going to beat him.

67
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:30,768
Me, the turncoat, the traitor.

68
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:34,203
The bourgeois idealist.

69
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,834
You'll see.

70
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:39,012
<i>When I'm world champion,
in Pravda they'll call it...</i>

71
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:42,044
yet another victory
for Soviet chess.

72
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:47,843
Did you bring me here
to tell me this crap?

73
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:53,659
- Did you see Marina?
- Yes.

74
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:55,494
How is she?

75
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:58,391
Fine, I think.

76
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:01,864
She didn't tell you anything?

77
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:04,762
Why doesn't she answer my letters?

78
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:07,203
What have you done to her?

79
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:12,339
Pavius, Marina wants a divorce.

80
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:18,379
Tell her to wait
until after the match.

81
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:29,352
Get rid of your cigarette,
Genady lvanovitch.

82
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:32,822
It's not even lit, Akiva Israelovitch.

83
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:37,229
But you threaten to smoke it.

84
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:41,867
In chess, threats
are more serious than actions.

85
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,633
You still enjoy beating me?

86
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:14,330
I savor the sweetness
just as you savor the bitterness.

87
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,140
Why did you come?

88
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:26,976
Just obeying orders.

89
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,254
Check.

90
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:44,969
- I want foam laid down everywhere.
- I'll see to it.

91
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,253
The pieces aren't heavy enough...

92
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,619
and I want more light.

93
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,591
We can change that.

94
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,329
- And the light?
- We can turn it up.

95
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:20,834
Go ahead.

96
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,171
Grandmaster Fromm
will tell you when.

97
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,983
That's fine.

98
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:36,087
- Keep that for the game. What's it at?
- Eighty.

99
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:38,947
Thank you.

100
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,875
- Well, honestly!
- What's going on, Anastase lganovitch?

101
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:11,180
- We're due at the theater at 11:00.
- Go on ahead. I trust you.

102
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:15,825
Make sure everything complies
with the protocol you negotiated.

103
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,055
But he demanded...

104
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,026
He can raise the lighting to 80.
I'll have it lowered if it bothers me.

105
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,463
- He also wants heavier pieces.
- That won't help him play any better.

106
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:25,136
But the cameras, the installations...

107
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:27,763
It makes no difference,
Anastase lganovitch.

108
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,308
I'm deaf.

109
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,712
Honestly, Akiva Israelovitch,
I just don't understand you!

110
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:45,720
- What do you live on?
- The generosity of my friends.

111
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,723
- They say you're an American agent.
- What does an American agent earn?

112
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:57,325
- Do you see yourself as a dissident?
- Absolutely not. I'm an exile.

113
00:10:57,604 --> 00:11:00,698
- You weren't involved in politics?
- Of course I was, since the cradle.

114
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:05,873
When I was a Young Pioneer,
I got a demerit for glorifying Stalin.

115
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:08,879
That was the Khrushchev era.
I was already a joker by then.

116
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,541
What is a joker?

117
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:14,453
A free man.

118
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:17,282
Back home, there are jokes
called "two by fours."

119
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:21,320
Two years in prison for listening to them,
four years for telling them.

120
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:26,664
But seriously, you were a member of the
Communist Party. Liebskind never was.

121
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:31,032
The party decides
who joins and who doesn't.

122
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:35,136
In Lithuania, you have to join the party.
You have no choice.

123
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:36,835
What about Liebskind?

124
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:38,570
Ask him yourself.

125
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:40,737
But speak up, 'cause he's deaf.

126
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,577
Why do you refuse to shake his hand?

127
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,250
Are you sure he hasn't been ordered
to refuse to shake mine?

128
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:53,749
Do you have any news of your wife?

129
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:58,490
I'd rather not talk about her.

130
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:01,095
I don't know anything.

131
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,964
I've had no news.

132
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:05,098
I fear the worst.

133
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:18,141
- Hello, Andre.
- Hello.

134
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,715
What floor?

135
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:31,956
- You tired? Want to play a game?
- No, thanks.

136
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,392
- Are you broke?
- Yes, very.

137
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:42,068
I can find you simultaneous matches
at an exhibition.

138
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,879
- I was thinking you might need me.
- Think again.

139
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:53,909
Fear has made you mean, Pavius.

140
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,784
You know all about fear.
You're an expert.

141
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,790
World champion coward.

142
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:00,917
You afraid of me?

143
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:04,692
Forget about getting
your revenge through me.

144
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:11,797
See you.

145
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,063
Good luck.

146
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:18,409
Shut up! That's bad luck.

147
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:23,747
You don't need help
in that department.

148
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:34,084
- We should've taken him. He's a genius.
- He's an alcoholic.

149
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,851
He would have beaten Liebskind
if he hadn't cracked in the second match.

150
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:39,431
- But he did. He's an asshole.
- I don't understand you.

151
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:45,965
I don't need anyone's help
to beat Liebskind.

152
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:48,626
I don't need anyone's help
to beat Liebskind.

153
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:54,063
Akiva.

154
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:43,117
You refuse to postpone the first game?

155
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,753
Absolutely.

156
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,825
Fromm will either be back today...

157
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:52,464
or we'll simply never see him again.

158
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:58,065
In that case, at 3:00 p.m. sharp
I'll start the clock...

159
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:01,732
and Grandmaster Liebskind
will make his first move.

160
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:04,666
Grandmaster Fromm
must arrive within one hour.

161
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:08,178
Otherwise, Liebskind will
remain world champion.

162
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:11,078
The rules allow
for no other possibility.

163
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:14,352
That's perfectly clear.

164
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:16,978
Good.

165
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:22,523
We should have warned the cops.
I always said he was unstable.

166
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:24,392
The cops would find him in a snap.

167
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,520
Hi.

168
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,087
Give him something to eat.
He's hungry.

169
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:33,893
A black cat!

170
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:40,101
- Is the guarantee all settled?
- Yes. He won't shake your hand.

171
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:42,201
Hurry.

172
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:46,841
A black cat!
He's off his rocker.

173
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,841
Careful, Miller.
He eats Bolshevik mice.

174
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,645
Why tell me that?

175
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:18,808
Gentlemen.

176
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:21,245
That's all. Thank you.

177
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:35,545
Please address the judge, comrade.

178
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,019
Come now, please.

179
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:45,187
No incidents.

180
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,462
Is this game a draw?

181
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:52,561
Yes.

182
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:06,942
By mutual consent,
Game 1 is declared a draw at move 35.

183
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:35,411
He was in a good position.
Why did he accept the draw?

184
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,083
I'd say you forced him to.

185
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:44,086
Besides, he's telling you...

186
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:48,260
"You old lion, I'll beat you
when I'm good and ready."

187
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:51,160
That's idiotic.

188
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:06,609
Aren't you afraid of me?

189
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:08,373
No. Why?

190
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:12,140
We all destroy ourselves
in one way or another.

191
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:15,216
What's important is
to enjoy oneself in the process.

192
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:22,993
How will he open?

193
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:28,257
I'm not asking for advice.
I'm proposing a wager.

194
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:30,098
$500.

195
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,694
$500.

196
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,066
Your opponent plays
a somewhat primitive game.

197
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:42,005
He withstood
your favorite opening move.

198
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:47,508
Now he'll want to beat you
at your favorite defense.

199
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:52,613
So he'll use an English opening,
confident you'll transpose.

200
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:54,522
But you won't transpose.

201
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:58,461
You'll surprise him
with a rarely used variation...

202
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:02,393
and a damned effective one!

203
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:17,873
I'm going to use the English opening
tomorrow. He's never beat me on that one.

204
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:21,352
Liebskind doesn't play
the classic English opening.

205
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:24,212
He'll transpose...

206
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:27,690
and you'll end up facing
the Tartakower variation...

207
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:30,455
with the Queen's Gambit,
his favorite defense.

208
00:22:30,563 --> 00:22:31,723
Exactly.

209
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:35,798
Then I'll castle queenside.

210
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:39,395
After that...

211
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:42,299
G4, H4...

212
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:45,806
and boom!

213
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:32,486
Look at that... an English opening.

214
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:36,094
Liebskind hasn't faced
an English since...

215
00:23:36,796 --> 00:23:41,233
Just wait. He'll play B7, B6 and transpose
to the Tartakower variation.

216
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,397
To transpose or not to transpose.

217
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:50,364
To Tartakower or not.

218
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:57,849
Knight to E4.
He doesn't transpose.

219
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:32,511
Check.

220
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:54,998
Grandmaster Liebskind wins Game 2.

221
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:58,105
Liebskind 1, Fromm 0.

222
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:02,105
You taught him a lesson,
Akiva Israelovitch.

223
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,844
Sunday I'll use an English opening.

224
00:25:07,086 --> 00:25:08,314
That's arrogance.

225
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,684
Fromm knows all the variations.

226
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:12,415
Akiva Israelovitch is right.

227
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:15,253
If he wins with that opening...

228
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:17,592
Fromm will be
completely demoralized.

229
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:20,758
Sure. But if he loses?

230
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:22,424
It will be a serious error.

231
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:26,632
I have a rather diabolical
variation in mind.

232
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:34,638
Knight takes F6, of course.

233
00:25:34,747 --> 00:25:36,681
And here's my invention.

234
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:40,081
This engine is too noisy!
I want a boat.

235
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,246
A boat?

236
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:45,223
A boat that goes on the water.

237
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,650
To cross the lake. A sailboat.

238
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:50,980
Play.

239
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:49,908
Grandmaster Fromm wins Game 3.

240
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:51,979
Liebskind 1, Fromm 1.

241
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:02,153
I'm going to bed.
Don't wake me.

242
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,228
I'm not hungry, Henia.

243
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:38,156
Go to bed now.
That's enough.

244
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,194
My heart's strong, Henia.
Strong! You hear me?

245
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:47,772
Are you keeping an eye on Miller?

246
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,805
Day and night.
Even in my sleep.

247
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,178
- Don't worry. The boy's fine.
- Then who is it?

248
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:56,978
No one, and you know it.

249
00:28:57,716 --> 00:28:59,343
This is ridiculous.

250
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:04,087
You're your own worst enemy.
Pavius, please.

251
00:29:05,324 --> 00:29:07,383
If it's not Miller,
then maybe it's you.

252
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:11,527
Mr. Felton, né Piebzhinski,
in Grodno, Poland!

253
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,634
We can destroy his French defense.

254
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:21,903
After bishop to B5,
he'll capture the pawn D4.

255
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:24,109
Queen to F6,
you sacrifice your advantage...

256
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:28,339
but now, queen to C3, check.
You take the rook.

257
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:33,109
And here's the deathblow: knight to E4.
Simple, isn't it?

258
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:36,946
Simple? Not really.

259
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,451
Everything depends
on the pawn on D4.

260
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:41,750
But it's very elegant.

261
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:43,993
It's dangerous.

262
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:45,790
But it's very elegant.

263
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:47,627
I like it. I like taking chances.

264
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:04,272
By mutual consent, Game 4
is declared a draw at the 39th move.

265
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:08,303
I tell you
there are microphones here.

266
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:10,381
Where? Tell me. Where?

267
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:17,985
Right off, without even thinking,
he played rook G6.

268
00:31:19,525 --> 00:31:21,083
There are mics...

269
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:23,255
or someone talked.

270
00:31:23,362 --> 00:31:24,829
You're crazy, Pavius.

271
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:29,066
Get a grip on yourself.
You're acting like a fool.

272
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:31,666
And you don't know him!

273
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:36,232
Nobody's betraying you.
The mics...

274
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:38,442
- I'll find them...
- Stop this.

275
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:42,839
Everyone here is on your side.

276
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:45,973
That's not true.

277
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:52,489
I will be the world champion.

278
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:53,984
Me, not you.

279
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,725
You will never be.

280
00:32:00,032 --> 00:32:01,556
We're leaving.

281
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,859
- We're moving.
- Where to?

282
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:05,901
That's your problem, not mine.

283
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:19,077
This is Commissioner Dalcroze,
head of security in Geneva.

284
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:22,885
He'll personally see
to your safety and your protection.

285
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:25,649
He's already doing it unofficially.

286
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:27,858
Thank you, Minister.

287
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:30,493
We've searched everywhere.
There are no mics here.

288
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:34,528
You'll be safe here.
I've put my best men at your disposal.

289
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,333
That will do.

290
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,505
I know what's on your mind.

291
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:54,652
Marina?

292
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,512
I don't think about that anymore.

293
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,315
It's hopeless.

294
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:02,757
They'll never let her out.

295
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:05,455
She wants a divorce.

296
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:08,729
She's right.

297
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:12,061
It hurts a little, that's all.

298
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:16,431
Did Tac-Tac tell you that?

299
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,477
And you believed him?

300
00:33:51,276 --> 00:33:52,903
Sir, I must protest.

301
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:57,611
My opponent's attitude is intolerable.

302
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:00,877
There is no rule
dictating punctuality.

303
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:04,585
He does it on purpose to upset me.
I officially protest.

304
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:11,190
The grand jury can only accept
your complaint in written form.

305
00:34:11,997 --> 00:34:13,760
I'll draw it up right now.

306
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:26,128
Grandmaster Fromm wins Game 5.

307
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:29,571
Liebskind 1, Fromm 2.

308
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:51,452
Not enough salt in your diet,
Akiva Israelovitch.

309
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,858
Enough of your insolence
and needling.

310
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:10,877
Good evening.

311
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,883
I officially requested
that the game be nullified.

312
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:21,816
How dare you request to nullify
a match without consulting me!

313
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:24,987
But you yourself protested.

314
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:27,826
So he would apologize
and be humiliated.

315
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,590
Withdraw this ridiculous request.

316
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,437
The jury will reject it.
The game was in accord with the rules.

317
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,964
Read that.

318
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:51,848
"We recommend an official protest...

319
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:56,355
on grounds of opponent's
intolerable attitude.

320
00:36:57,762 --> 00:37:00,731
Withdraw if he refuses to apologize.

321
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:07,100
Have sent Grandmaster Fadenko
and Professor Polotin...

322
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:10,541
with verbal instructions.

323
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:14,202
Antonin Karapov."
The minister himself.

324
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:19,075
What Grandmaster Fromm is doing
is not against the rules.

325
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:23,185
Listen, I'm here unofficially.
The jury hasn't convened yet.

326
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:26,481
The Soviets think
that Fromm's repeated tardiness...

327
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:30,118
is deliberately calculated to destroy
his opponent's concentration.

328
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:31,855
They want the game nullified.

329
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:34,727
That's absurd! To disturb your opponent,
you must be present...

330
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:37,563
and Fromm was not there.
This is ridiculous.

331
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:41,130
What does Liebskind's letter say?

332
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:44,709
To my knowledge,
he demands that the two players...

333
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:46,967
arrive at the same time
at the beginning of each game.

334
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:49,679
That's not stipulated
anywhere in the protocol.

335
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:53,649
Liebskind's demand has no legal basis,
and you know it.

336
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:58,455
The jury would still appreciate it
if Fromm granted this request...

337
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:02,584
and, as a gesture of appeasement,
he apologized to his opponent.

338
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:05,853
- But it's unintentional.
- Unintentional but systematic.

339
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:09,058
- Whose side are you on?
- The Soviets threaten to withdraw.

340
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:13,628
I'll write your letter of apology.
The bastards!

341
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:16,738
I won't give them
an excuse to run out on me.

342
00:38:35,026 --> 00:38:36,960
Akiva, eat something.

343
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:39,191
No, Henia. I'm not hungry.

344
00:38:39,798 --> 00:38:42,596
You took your medication.
You have to eat something.

345
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:24,439
Well?

346
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:28,372
I want you to know
that I didn't ask to come.

347
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,744
I know. But I'm glad to see you.

348
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:35,208
Well?

349
00:39:35,954 --> 00:39:37,581
Fromm plays well.

350
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:40,685
Good strategy,
but he moves too quickly.

351
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:45,457
Your game's a little heavy-handed.

352
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:51,863
Like Georgian champagne.
Too much sugar and not enough body.

353
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,234
They're worried.

354
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:57,639
Who's that?

355
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,332
A secret weapon.

356
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:02,673
You are to cooperate.

357
00:40:03,682 --> 00:40:06,116
So they think I need a secret weapon.

358
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:25,132
Akiva, are you thirsty?

359
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:28,963
Do you want some tea?

360
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:37,912
Are you in pain?

361
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:45,013
I'm afraid, Henia.

362
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:51,157
What if Akiva Liebskind
is no longer Akiva Liebskind?

363
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:00,432
Don't cry.

364
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:03,437
Don't cry. I'm here.

365
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:55,322
Gentlemen, if you please.

366
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:45,675
Do you see what I see?

367
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:48,369
Mate in seven moves.

368
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,056
He didn't notice. Incredible.

369
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:15,796
Have that man removed.

370
00:44:17,902 --> 00:44:20,769
Remove that man immediately!

371
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:23,206
What is it?

372
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:26,170
That man there, in the first row.

373
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:29,838
He's trying to control me.
I can't concentrate.

374
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:33,746
He's hypnotizing me.

375
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:37,411
That's it. He's hypnotizing me.

376
00:44:39,324 --> 00:44:40,985
Remove him or I will leave.

377
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:46,623
The rules are very clear on this point,
and I must uphold them.

378
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:50,133
I cannot ask a spectator to leave...

379
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:52,293
unless both players request it.

380
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:55,363
Is that man bothering you?

381
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,164
Frankly, no.

382
00:44:57,742 --> 00:45:01,109
I'm the one he's hypnotizing.

383
00:45:02,647 --> 00:45:04,114
They want to kill me.

384
00:45:07,352 --> 00:45:08,910
This is ridiculous.

385
00:45:09,187 --> 00:45:11,985
Fanciful accusations
of a disturbed mind.

386
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,863
Remain calm, please.

387
00:45:22,967 --> 00:45:25,299
Is that man part of your delegation?

388
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:29,267
Professor Polotin is a respected scientist,
and an honorary member of our federation.

389
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:32,401
He's here in the interest of science...

390
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,808
for observation necessary to his work.

391
00:45:34,946 --> 00:45:37,437
The organizing committee
granted him an official pass.

392
00:45:37,548 --> 00:45:39,778
I will not play
as long as he's in the audience.

393
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:42,114
- Please!
- He's a parapsychologist!

394
00:45:45,723 --> 00:45:49,682
To avoid interrupting the game,
we will continue in the small theater.

395
00:45:50,728 --> 00:45:53,629
The audience can follow the match
on the wallboard.

396
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,726
We object.
It's against the rules.

397
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:01,904
Only the jury can make such a decision.
It's not within your power.

398
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:08,541
As judge, I'm to ensure that the match
is played in accordance with the rules.

399
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:12,276
It is my duty.
I take note of your objection.

400
00:46:13,451 --> 00:46:16,011
But nothing can stop me
from having this game played...

401
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,588
behind the curtain, if I see fit.

402
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:21,348
That's it.

403
00:46:23,261 --> 00:46:27,721
Draw the Iron Curtain. Perfect!
It's all clear.

404
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:37,263
I might persuade Professor Polotin
to move to the fourth row.

405
00:46:38,076 --> 00:46:39,600
Stop.

406
00:46:39,911 --> 00:46:42,038
The Iron Curtain!

407
00:46:46,117 --> 00:46:49,052
I propose we continue the game...

408
00:46:50,288 --> 00:46:52,552
by turning the table...

409
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,816
so that only Grandmaster Liebskind...

410
00:46:56,094 --> 00:47:00,588
faces the honorary member
of the Soviet federation...

411
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:04,926
since his presence doesn't bother him.

412
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,468
Do you accept
Grandmaster Felton's proposal?

413
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,900
I'm here to play chess.

414
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:25,811
You agree?

415
00:48:27,218 --> 00:48:29,186
This is inadmissible.
I officially protest.

416
00:48:45,203 --> 00:48:48,570
Please, gentlemen.
The game will now continue.

417
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:16,390
Grandmaster Liebskind wins Game 6.

418
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:19,465
Liebskind 2, Fromm 2.

419
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,680
Look here. What do you see?

420
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:34,912
- Mate in seven.
- Right. And this was your move.

421
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:39,020
Those bastards!

422
00:49:39,223 --> 00:49:41,589
That damn parapsychologist!

423
00:49:41,826 --> 00:49:44,260
Calm down.
I asked to nullify the game.

424
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:46,325
That's ridiculous!

425
00:49:46,697 --> 00:49:49,063
They're preparing something else.
You'll see.

426
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:52,097
Not for the moment.
Puhl stood fast.

427
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,067
They can't get to him.

428
00:49:54,272 --> 00:49:56,069
If he leaves, we'll leave too.

429
00:49:56,274 --> 00:49:59,801
They know it.
Now stop fiddling with that.

430
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,275
- This?
- Yes.

431
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,713
This is a scepter.

432
00:50:04,982 --> 00:50:06,847
It's Liebskind's pen.

433
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:09,652
He left it on the table.

434
00:50:09,754 --> 00:50:13,053
- You have to give it back.
- You don't understand.

435
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:16,188
He didn't forget it.

436
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:20,294
He meant to give it to me.
I'm sure of it.

437
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,631
I was 10 when he came to Kovno
for the championship.

438
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:28,170
He won.

439
00:50:28,372 --> 00:50:31,239
Afterwards, he agreed to play
a simultaneous match...

440
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:32,969
<i>against the club's best players.</i>

441
00:50:33,344 --> 00:50:35,744
<i>I was the only one to beat him.</i>

442
00:50:37,682 --> 00:50:39,309
<i>He was fantastic.</i>

443
00:50:40,351 --> 00:50:42,581
<i>He asked for a rematch...</i>

444
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:46,156
<i>as if I were a real player
and notjust some kid.</i>

445
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:50,417
<i>He won, of course,
and afterwards he asked me...</i>

446
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:53,624
<i>"Do you want one last game?"</i>

447
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:57,098
<i>I said, "No. I want your secrets."</i>

448
00:50:58,102 --> 00:50:59,797
<i>He laughed.</i>

449
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:05,339
Play to win or I'll slap you.

450
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:12,248
<i>For two hours
he gave me a lesson in chess.</i>

451
00:51:13,918 --> 00:51:15,351
Me.

452
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,747
Just me.

453
00:51:18,923 --> 00:51:20,686
And I've forgotten none of it.

454
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:23,624
It was impossible to forget.

455
00:51:25,363 --> 00:51:29,094
Tomorrow get him one just like this...

456
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:32,759
but in gold.

457
00:51:33,871 --> 00:51:35,168
You see?

458
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,801
A very beautiful pen.

459
00:51:41,011 --> 00:51:43,571
That way we'll be even.

460
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:49,775
Damn pen.
Where could I have lost it?

461
00:51:52,256 --> 00:51:53,951
In the car.

462
00:51:54,225 --> 00:51:56,750
The car or the boat.
We have to go see.

463
00:51:58,996 --> 00:52:00,623
Have you seen my pen?

464
00:52:00,731 --> 00:52:02,722
We'd like to speak with you,
Akiva Israelovitch.

465
00:52:03,134 --> 00:52:05,796
Your attitude when they expelled
Professor Polotin.

466
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:09,372
Your passivity and silence
could be misinterpreted.

467
00:52:09,507 --> 00:52:11,805
My silence is just that.
Interpret it as you will.

468
00:52:12,076 --> 00:52:14,203
- But Moscow...
- What about Moscow?

469
00:52:15,012 --> 00:52:17,981
Do they have another world champion?
A better player to send in?

470
00:52:18,082 --> 00:52:19,947
Moscow can go to hell!
Find my pen!

471
00:52:31,862 --> 00:52:33,762
You're a beauty.

472
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:38,065
But will you bring me luck?

473
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:16,130
Liebskind 2, Fromm 3.

474
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:33,212
Give me one.

475
00:53:45,202 --> 00:53:48,467
If you start smoking again,
you'll never quit.

476
00:54:31,148 --> 00:54:35,710
Please propose a draw
to my opponent.

477
00:54:39,256 --> 00:54:40,746
Grandmaster Fromm?

478
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:42,822
He must play.

479
00:55:20,965 --> 00:55:22,398
Check.

480
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:35,642
Check.

481
00:55:44,355 --> 00:55:45,754
Check.

482
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,807
Grandmaster Liebskind wins Game 8.

483
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:09,943
Liebskind 3, Fromm 3.

484
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:25,385
That's twice.

485
00:56:26,397 --> 00:56:30,834
First he sacrifices the rook.
Then he sacrifices the queen.

486
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:35,800
His favorite move.
Poetic... eternal.

487
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:41,107
The snare of desire
snared by his desire.

488
00:56:42,246 --> 00:56:45,044
You feel humiliated.
Are you afraid?

489
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:48,918
You're beginning to understand.
You and I are alike.

490
00:56:49,253 --> 00:56:51,949
You're drunk. Go to bed.

491
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:53,954
You've no excuse.

492
00:56:54,058 --> 00:56:56,788
Pride made you play too quickly.

493
00:56:57,861 --> 00:57:01,126
You have no excuse.
He's going to slaughter you.

494
00:57:01,265 --> 00:57:02,823
He likes blood.

495
00:57:03,934 --> 00:57:05,231
He's ruthless!

496
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:33,195
I quit.

497
00:57:40,904 --> 00:57:43,099
I don't think so.

498
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:08,631
Feel better?

499
00:58:10,868 --> 00:58:12,199
Yes.

500
00:59:11,328 --> 00:59:14,229
Grandmaster Fromm wins Game 9.

501
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:17,464
Liebskind 3, Fromm 4.

502
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:33,348
I hope you're happy.
You came to see me lose.

503
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:37,378
Get out of my sight. Go.

504
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:53,035
Throw that away, please.

505
00:59:53,637 --> 00:59:56,629
It's poison, Henia... and very good.

506
01:00:15,893 --> 01:00:18,589
Why have you never wanted
to play chess with me?

507
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,822
I'm not the jealous type.

508
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:26,434
You know you'd never let me win.

509
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:33,303
We'll go to Italy after this.

510
01:00:34,778 --> 01:00:36,973
You've always wanted to see Italy.

511
01:00:38,215 --> 01:00:40,012
I haven't been
a good husband, Henia.

512
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:42,910
I've never wanted any other.

513
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:51,354
At the university you fell in love
with a young mathematician.

514
01:00:52,963 --> 01:00:55,454
A future professor.
A scientist.

515
01:00:56,466 --> 01:00:58,058
Look at me today.

516
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:01,199
You're a great champion.

517
01:01:05,242 --> 01:01:06,209
I'm a player.

518
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:08,874
Just a player.

519
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:24,188
The other one.

520
01:01:43,447 --> 01:01:44,744
I'm all right.

521
01:01:44,948 --> 01:01:46,779
It's not the first time.

522
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:02,792
I'm going to sleep a little.

523
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:06,264
Don't worry.

524
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:13,941
Check.

525
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:49,376
Game 10 is adjourned at move 41.

526
01:02:50,013 --> 01:02:52,174
We will resume tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.

527
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,358
He's sick.

528
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:20,969
Shit!

529
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:24,540
I'm sure they'll make him croak
rather than let me beat him.

530
01:04:24,641 --> 01:04:26,632
The championship
is what you're after.

531
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:28,870
I play to spite the damn bastards.

532
01:04:42,025 --> 01:04:44,585
- How is he?
- He's sleeping.

533
01:04:45,162 --> 01:04:47,153
I can't come back before tomorrow.

534
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,522
Very well. Let's go in.

535
01:04:55,639 --> 01:04:57,436
Excuse us, Akiva Israelovitch.

536
01:04:58,608 --> 01:05:00,041
This is Dr. Randelier.

537
01:05:01,444 --> 01:05:03,537
We'd like him to examine you.

538
01:05:04,581 --> 01:05:06,276
I feel fine.

539
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:09,518
I must insist.
Moscow wants an official denial.

540
01:05:10,086 --> 01:05:12,554
Dr. Randelier
is an eminent cardiologist.

541
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:17,321
I have a physician: Dr. Anton Heller.

542
01:05:18,562 --> 01:05:22,054
The authorities in my country
would not allow him to accompany me.

543
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:26,897
Don't be offended, but no doctor
will examine me in his absence.

544
01:05:28,238 --> 01:05:31,969
After the blow he dealt, we can't win.

545
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,335
A draw is still possible.

546
01:05:36,046 --> 01:05:37,377
Look.

547
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:50,887
Fine. Let's propose a draw.

548
01:05:51,528 --> 01:05:54,520
And you think Fromm
is stupid enough to accept.

549
01:05:57,801 --> 01:06:00,065
He refuses treatment.
He wants Heller.

550
01:06:01,538 --> 01:06:03,563
We're done for.

551
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,105
They'll never let Heller out.
His children are in Israel.

552
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,612
Let's pray that Fromm cracks.

553
01:06:13,149 --> 01:06:15,583
Why pray?

554
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,220
But of course.

555
01:06:21,091 --> 01:06:23,184
We'll crack him ourselves...

556
01:06:24,027 --> 01:06:26,552
and we have the perfect nutcracker.

557
01:06:26,663 --> 01:06:28,528
His wife.

558
01:06:37,007 --> 01:06:38,998
It's a dangerous move.

559
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:42,476
It could hurt our prestige.

560
01:06:43,847 --> 01:06:45,838
We're in the West.
Imagine the scandal.

561
01:06:46,683 --> 01:06:48,310
They'll never allow it.

562
01:06:49,419 --> 01:06:52,752
Dear comrade, I'm leaving for Moscow.
I'll go to the minister...

563
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:57,355
- and higher, if I have to.
- You won't have time.

564
01:06:57,761 --> 01:07:00,286
The match resumes at 4:00 p.m.

565
01:07:01,231 --> 01:07:03,961
The next match is in two days,
at 3:00 p.m.

566
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:06,926
I'll make it by then.

567
01:07:09,205 --> 01:07:12,504
It's the only solution.
They'll agree.

568
01:07:15,078 --> 01:07:16,636
It's the perfect move.

569
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:33,222
Grandmaster Fromm wins Game 10.

570
01:08:34,257 --> 01:08:37,556
Liebskind 3, Fromm 5.

571
01:08:47,237 --> 01:08:49,501
We'd like to speak with you,
Akiva Israelovitch.

572
01:08:49,773 --> 01:08:51,331
Leave me alone.

573
01:08:55,812 --> 01:08:56,938
Anton.

574
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:05,412
You've worked a miracle.

575
01:09:06,022 --> 01:09:08,217
It took them long enough
to understand.

576
01:09:37,754 --> 01:09:39,119
Here you are.

577
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:42,815
Try to get some rest.

578
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,623
I'll come see you tomorrow.

579
01:09:51,768 --> 01:09:54,532
I'll leave you Pavius' phone number.

580
01:09:57,474 --> 01:09:59,032
Call him when you want.

581
01:09:59,209 --> 01:10:00,608
Get out.

582
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:18,860
Anton, will you listen to me?

583
01:10:19,629 --> 01:10:21,654
Stay calm, Akiva.

584
01:10:29,205 --> 01:10:32,333
He won't be able to play tomorrow.
He couldn't withstand it.

585
01:10:33,276 --> 01:10:35,073
I'll need some drugs.

586
01:10:37,847 --> 01:10:40,509
Get a Swiss doctor
for the prescription.

587
01:10:50,727 --> 01:10:52,194
Listen to me, Anton.

588
01:10:53,429 --> 01:10:55,158
Akiva, this is serious.

589
01:10:55,798 --> 01:10:57,129
I know.

590
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:01,363
I can feel it.

591
01:11:02,805 --> 01:11:04,568
I'm not asking you to extend my life.

592
01:11:04,674 --> 01:11:07,165
I don't want to live 10 more years
like a vegetable.

593
01:11:07,844 --> 01:11:09,175
I want 10 days.

594
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,871
Ten days, but with all my faculties.

595
01:11:14,651 --> 01:11:16,915
All my faculties, you understand?

596
01:11:19,055 --> 01:11:22,024
- I don't even know if I can save you.
- I don't give a damn!

597
01:11:24,227 --> 01:11:27,685
I don't care if I die.
I want to beat that little bastard.

598
01:11:29,365 --> 01:11:31,526
I've figured it out.
I've got him.

599
01:11:32,201 --> 01:11:34,635
I'm the one giving the orders now.

600
01:11:35,572 --> 01:11:39,064
What do you think?
Zionist bastard!

601
01:11:41,377 --> 01:11:45,177
You think I refused the doctor's care
here to please you?

602
01:11:46,349 --> 01:11:48,977
That I had you brought here
so you could preach to me?

603
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:51,282
You'll do as I say.

604
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:53,688
You're the only one who can do it.

605
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:55,689
That's why you're here.

606
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:57,783
What you ask is unworthy of a friend.

607
01:11:57,994 --> 01:12:00,360
Ten days. I want to beat that kid.

608
01:12:01,431 --> 01:12:03,695
It's my life and it's my hide!

609
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:05,332
It might be too late.

610
01:12:05,602 --> 01:12:07,900
No, it's not too late.
I can beat him. I know it.

611
01:12:08,171 --> 01:12:09,468
Quiet now.

612
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:18,142
Akiva, I'm not a miracle worker.

613
01:12:19,682 --> 01:12:21,673
I'll need some other drugs.

614
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:23,684
Will he be able to play?

615
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,219
If he tolerates the treatment,
in three days he'll look like he can.

616
01:12:27,357 --> 01:12:30,292
But not for long.
Ten days at most.

617
01:12:31,661 --> 01:12:33,424
We have to postpone the match.

618
01:12:34,197 --> 01:12:35,630
Out of the question.

619
01:12:36,165 --> 01:12:38,827
Liebskind's illness must be kept secret.

620
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:46,038
Fromm has to ask
for the postponement.

621
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:51,337
The beauty of the plan
lies in that detail.

622
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:53,548
The nutcracker.

623
01:12:57,453 --> 01:12:59,250
Pavius is waiting for you.

624
01:13:00,023 --> 01:13:01,422
You're lying.

625
01:13:06,629 --> 01:13:09,223
I know you brought me here
to make him lose the match...

626
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,459
and that you're counting
on the element of surprise.

627
01:13:16,272 --> 01:13:18,536
The element of surprise isn't necessary.

628
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:20,809
Just preferable.

629
01:13:22,278 --> 01:13:23,836
Get out.

630
01:13:30,353 --> 01:13:31,980
You'll go to him.

631
01:13:33,723 --> 01:13:35,486
You need him.

632
01:13:37,326 --> 01:13:39,089
You have no choice.

633
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:43,461
Neither escape...

634
01:13:44,067 --> 01:13:45,466
nor suicide...

635
01:13:46,069 --> 01:13:48,003
is a solution.

636
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:54,371
I hate you.

637
01:13:57,113 --> 01:13:58,637
And so you should.

638
01:16:54,724 --> 01:16:56,817
Thank you for coming, Colonel.

639
01:17:07,003 --> 01:17:08,868
She's locked herself in her room.

640
01:17:10,139 --> 01:17:13,540
You're making a simple operation
very difficult.

641
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,444
She'll crack for sure.

642
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:20,975
But I don't know when.

643
01:17:21,284 --> 01:17:26,517
Never leave anything to chance.
Never.

644
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:29,681
We'll make our move at noon.

645
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:39,532
Mrs. Fromm?

646
01:17:39,802 --> 01:17:42,532
Federal police.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

647
01:17:42,805 --> 01:17:45,103
We're here to help you.

648
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:49,242
Our department has learned
from very reliable sources...

649
01:17:49,845 --> 01:17:51,642
that your life is in danger.

650
01:17:52,348 --> 01:17:54,816
We're taking you under our protection.

651
01:17:55,918 --> 01:17:57,408
Where are you taking me?

652
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,011
Judge Dombert has drawn up
a request for political asylum.

653
01:18:00,723 --> 01:18:03,487
An unavoidable legal formality.

654
01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:07,691
- But where will you take me?
- To your husband.

655
01:18:07,964 --> 01:18:11,161
You'll be safe there.
He's already under our protection.

656
01:18:13,769 --> 01:18:16,169
Protect me here, in this room.

657
01:18:17,173 --> 01:18:18,868
No, madam. That's impossible.

658
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:22,768
Come look.

659
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,904
Come, Mrs. Fromm.

660
01:18:29,752 --> 01:18:34,348
We'd have to put two armed men...

661
01:18:34,623 --> 01:18:37,023
on each roof round the clock.

662
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:40,362
I don't have the manpower.

663
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:44,257
They don't need to kill me, you know.

664
01:18:47,236 --> 01:18:48,931
You're all the same.

665
01:18:52,074 --> 01:18:55,601
Promise me I won't see him
until the match is over.

666
01:18:55,878 --> 01:18:57,903
Mrs. Fromm, think about it.

667
01:18:58,714 --> 01:19:02,047
If they were the ones who warned us,
they can also inform the press...

668
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:03,975
and your husband.

669
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:06,347
They may already have done it.

670
01:19:07,523 --> 01:19:09,388
Trust us.

671
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:12,385
They've won.

672
01:19:21,804 --> 01:19:23,294
Everything will be fine.

673
01:19:29,645 --> 01:19:31,909
Pavius will never forgive me.

674
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:42,754
Let's go, comrade.
Tonight I'll be world champion.

675
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:22,719
One hour before the match. This is
unacceptable. We were about to leave.

676
01:20:25,568 --> 01:20:27,195
Very well.

677
01:20:28,337 --> 01:20:30,100
Good-bye, Mr. President,
and thank you.

678
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:35,166
They've asked to have
the match postponed.

679
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,377
Have faith, Pavius.

680
01:20:50,793 --> 01:20:52,260
Do you love me?

681
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:04,002
Say it.

682
01:21:12,848 --> 01:21:14,475
You're here.

683
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,280
Now I feel strong.

684
01:21:23,826 --> 01:21:26,158
I will be world champion.

685
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:30,799
We'll have a child after this.

686
01:21:38,741 --> 01:21:40,402
Don't be sad anymore.

687
01:21:43,379 --> 01:21:44,778
Sad?

688
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:50,882
"Depressive and antisocial"
they called it at the hospital.

689
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:03,928
How long did you stay there?

690
01:22:06,735 --> 01:22:08,293
One year...

691
01:22:09,071 --> 01:22:10,561
twenty-seven days...

692
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:13,332
and eight hours.

693
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:20,039
They wanted me to divorce you.
But I didn't want to.

694
01:22:23,018 --> 01:22:25,179
I'm not crazy.

695
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,924
Of course you're not.

696
01:22:32,728 --> 01:22:34,389
Don't be sad anymore.

697
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:36,028
Everything will be fine.

698
01:22:40,436 --> 01:22:43,166
A Rui Lopez? What do you think?

699
01:22:47,443 --> 01:22:50,503
I don't know.
I'm not thinking about that.

700
01:22:51,747 --> 01:22:52,941
No, that wouldn't work.

701
01:22:53,048 --> 01:22:55,744
We need a more sophisticated opening,
one that's rarely used.

702
01:22:58,754 --> 01:23:00,221
Pushkin.

703
01:23:00,623 --> 01:23:02,147
Goethe.

704
01:23:04,493 --> 01:23:06,427
Do as you like, Akiva.

705
01:23:08,497 --> 01:23:10,829
I need your intuition, Henia.

706
01:23:13,402 --> 01:23:15,097
I don't know anymore.

707
01:23:18,641 --> 01:23:22,475
You're right. We need a variation
from before the modernist revolution.

708
01:23:23,746 --> 01:23:25,941
- Some forgotten pearl.
- Stop it, Akiva!

709
01:23:30,152 --> 01:23:31,642
It's too late.

710
01:23:32,955 --> 01:23:36,356
Pretend, Henia.
You must always pretend.

711
01:24:00,983 --> 01:24:02,917
What is that strange opening?

712
01:24:04,153 --> 01:24:06,178
An old museum piece...
the Ponziani.

713
01:24:08,824 --> 01:24:11,520
The bastards did their homework.

714
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:54,758
Grandmaster Liebskind wins Game 11.

715
01:24:55,337 --> 01:24:58,306
Liebskind 4, Fromm 5.

716
01:25:32,074 --> 01:25:34,975
You think I'm going
to make you lose.

717
01:25:36,478 --> 01:25:37,775
Say it.

718
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,047
Shout it!

719
01:25:41,617 --> 01:25:43,175
But do something!

720
01:25:44,753 --> 01:25:46,050
Don't go.

721
01:25:53,462 --> 01:25:57,091
There's so much to tell you, Pavius.

722
01:26:01,403 --> 01:26:03,371
But I've forgotten it all.

723
01:26:05,307 --> 01:26:08,276
Something's wrong.
I'm all confused.

724
01:26:09,912 --> 01:26:12,813
Make one last effort.

725
01:26:16,552 --> 01:26:18,782
Talk to me.

726
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:25,254
Soon we'll have
all the time in the world to talk.

727
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:28,456
Right now I must work.

728
01:26:30,098 --> 01:26:32,931
I must win this match.

729
01:26:38,707 --> 01:26:43,007
You no longer hate enough
to win on your own.

730
01:26:46,782 --> 01:26:48,272
Try to relax.

731
01:26:53,121 --> 01:26:54,782
Try and sleep.

732
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,027
It's almost over.

733
01:27:01,296 --> 01:27:02,593
Here.

734
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:05,991
Take this.

735
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:15,736
Sleep.

736
01:27:17,913 --> 01:27:19,471
Everything will be all right.

737
01:27:23,018 --> 01:27:24,713
It will soon be over.

738
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:52,012
Bastard.

739
01:27:59,755 --> 01:28:01,086
Bastard.

740
01:28:03,158 --> 01:28:05,149
Leave him alone.
Let him withdraw.

741
01:28:14,236 --> 01:28:15,794
He's going to die.

742
01:28:18,674 --> 01:28:20,642
At least let him die in peace.

743
01:28:23,245 --> 01:28:25,008
Akiva, postpone this match.

744
01:28:25,647 --> 01:28:27,512
Don't give me orders.

745
01:28:30,385 --> 01:28:31,943
Look.

746
01:28:38,126 --> 01:28:40,094
Give me that shot.
I'll be fine.

747
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:10,858
Check.

748
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:16,820
Check.

749
01:29:19,434 --> 01:29:20,628
Mate!

750
01:29:21,937 --> 01:29:23,199
Mate!

751
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:44,885
Grandmaster Liebskind wins Game 12.

752
01:29:46,228 --> 01:29:48,594
Liebskind 5, Fromm 5.

753
01:30:09,184 --> 01:30:10,811
Anton, I don't feel well at all.

754
01:30:20,262 --> 01:30:22,196
Let us through.

755
01:31:13,115 --> 01:31:15,310
Very good, Pavius.

756
01:31:15,884 --> 01:31:18,648
You're getting mean again.
You'll beat him.

757
01:31:32,467 --> 01:31:33,934
Come with me.

758
01:31:46,047 --> 01:31:47,309
What's the matter?

759
01:31:47,415 --> 01:31:49,610
Grandmaster Liebskind
is in the hospital.

760
01:31:49,751 --> 01:31:53,187
Mr. Kerossian has just informed us
he has withdrawn.

761
01:31:53,922 --> 01:31:55,719
Congratulations.

762
01:31:56,324 --> 01:31:57,848
You are now world champion.

763
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:04,698
Is it serious?

764
01:32:07,903 --> 01:32:09,928
There won't be a rematch?

765
01:32:12,307 --> 01:32:13,831
I don't think so.

766
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:20,307
Unless you insist, we've decided
to suspend the usual ceremony...

767
01:32:21,183 --> 01:32:22,741
given the circumstances.

768
01:32:24,352 --> 01:32:25,910
Here is your check.

769
01:32:26,688 --> 01:32:28,918
$100,000.

770
01:32:31,626 --> 01:32:33,389
With our congratulations.

771
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:47,400
I told you they'd kill him
to keep me from beating him.

772
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:50,837
That's absurd, Pavius.

773
01:32:52,414 --> 01:32:54,279
Absurd.

774
01:32:56,518 --> 01:32:59,681
Go now. You won't be able to
if you wait.

775
01:33:06,294 --> 01:33:08,854
Get out of here.
I don't want you to watch me die.

776
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:14,730
Go toJerusalem.

777
01:33:15,203 --> 01:33:17,467
You've always been a zealot
deep down.

778
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:37,258
You see?
I haven't forgotten everything.

779
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:48,165
He needs you.

780
01:34:08,657 --> 01:34:11,820
<i>I'm a Soviet citizen.
I request political asylum.</i>

781
01:34:13,061 --> 01:34:16,553
<i>I'm a Soviet citizen.
I request political asylum.</i>

782
01:34:36,718 --> 01:34:38,879
I'd like you to come with me.

783
01:34:40,355 --> 01:34:42,380
I'm going back to the hospital.

784
01:34:43,892 --> 01:34:47,020
I need the drugs.

785
01:34:48,663 --> 01:34:50,824
Everything inside me is chaos.

786
01:34:51,866 --> 01:34:53,959
I'm sick. It's true.

787
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:58,039
I'll only do you harm.

788
01:34:59,307 --> 01:35:00,831
Nothing but harm.

789
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:08,342
Listen, Marina.

790
01:35:09,484 --> 01:35:12,009
It's over.
I'm world champion.

791
01:35:12,887 --> 01:35:14,752
We have all the time in the world.

792
01:35:19,861 --> 01:35:23,353
They won. They destroyed me
so I could destroy you.

793
01:35:26,401 --> 01:35:28,266
They won.

794
01:35:52,394 --> 01:35:54,089
I've been expecting you.

795
01:36:16,885 --> 01:36:18,614
You start.

796
01:36:22,924 --> 01:36:25,552
- E4.
- E6.

797
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:29,687
- D4.
- D5.

798
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:32,632
E5.

799
01:36:33,835 --> 01:36:35,302
C5.

800
01:36:35,804 --> 01:36:37,294
C3.

801
01:36:37,572 --> 01:36:39,506
Knight to C6.

802
01:36:40,108 --> 01:36:42,042
Knight to F3.

803
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:47,772
Queen to B6.

804
01:36:49,217 --> 01:36:51,651
Bishop to E2.

805
01:36:53,121 --> 01:36:54,349
C takes D.

806
01:36:54,589 --> 01:36:56,386
C takes D.

807
01:36:57,325 --> 01:36:59,054
Knight to H6.

808
01:37:00,028 --> 01:37:02,019
Knight to C3.

809
01:37:03,965 --> 01:37:05,557
Knight to F5.

810
01:37:06,701 --> 01:37:08,760
Knight to A4.

811
01:37:09,537 --> 01:37:11,698
Bishop to B4 and check.

812
01:37:13,274 --> 01:37:15,071
Bishop to D2.

813
01:37:16,177 --> 01:37:17,906
Queen to A5.

814
01:37:20,982 --> 01:37:22,643
Bishop to C3.

815
01:37:25,987 --> 01:37:27,648
B5.

816
01:37:31,292 --> 01:37:32,520
A3.

817
01:37:34,262 --> 01:37:35,991
Bishop takes C3.

818
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,491
Knight takes C3.

819
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:43,669
B4.

820
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,037
A takes B4.

821
01:37:48,776 --> 01:37:50,300
Queen takes B4.
