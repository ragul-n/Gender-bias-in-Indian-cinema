1
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:04,439
{Kumari Devi,}

2
00:00:04,828 --> 00:00:07,964
{we pray that}

3
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:11,332
{with your blessing}

4
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:13,885
{Taleju will bring the generosity}

5
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:19,574
{of America to our cause.}

6
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:27,322
BLAKE (over speaker): For the 9:30 a.m.
National Security Council meeting,

7
00:00:27,323 --> 00:00:29,158
- you'll need the memo on cyber security...
- Yeah.

8
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,359
...which you took home.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,529
Worst bedtime reading ever.

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,831
I can get you another copy.

11
00:00:34,832 --> 00:00:36,299
Ha! No need.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,535
Okay, so staff briefing

13
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,604
after NSC, then... what?

14
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,005
At 2:15, there's a reception

15
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:46,275
for the departing Finnish ambassador.

16
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:47,677
I hope he brings that salty licorice.

17
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:48,911
God, I love that stuff.

18
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:50,379
We'll look into that for you.

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,747
Oh! Hey.

20
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:53,282
Don't let me forget
about Henry's interview

21
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:54,984
on <i>Book TV</i> on C-SPAN tomorrow, okay?

22
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:58,054
It hath been ordained.

23
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:00,422
That's a small biblical joke for Henry.

24
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:03,426
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

25
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:04,101
Thanks, babe.

26
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:06,028
You know, you guys should
check it out, too.

27
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:08,698
A Z-SPAN interview on Dad's
book about St. Francis

28
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:10,233
that I already hear too much about?

29
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:12,068
Well, if you actually
read your father's work

30
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:13,336
instead of trashing it,

31
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:15,271
you'd know how totally
UN-Franciscan that was.

32
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:16,672
HENRY: Oh, word.

33
00:01:16,673 --> 00:01:18,241
I humbly and meekly apologize.

34
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:20,343
JASON: He was also sort
of a revolutionary.

35
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:21,978
Completely rejected any
form of material wealth.

36
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:23,279
STEVIE: He also led

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,547
the first environmental movement.

38
00:01:24,548 --> 00:01:25,779
Wait, you guys read it?

39
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,283
I'll make you an
autographed copy, Noodle.

40
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:28,451
You're gonna love it.

41
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:29,852
Ooh. Burn.

42
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:34,790
Wow, that is one manly breakfast
you got there, slugger.

43
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,092
Jason is trying to bulk up for football.

44
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:37,360
Isn't it cute?

45
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:39,228
Okay, "cute" isn't exactly
what I'm going for.

46
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,730
And slugger's baseball, Mom.

47
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,098
Ooh. Okay.

48
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,399
(phone buzzing)

49
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,468
Stevie, why are you getting

50
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,202
a call from the White House?

51
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,272
Oh.

52
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:51,474
It's Harrison.

53
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:52,975
He's trying to ditch my caller ID.

54
00:01:52,976 --> 00:01:54,210
I'm not engaging.

55
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,711
Oh.

56
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,846
It's fine.

57
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:57,813
You're allowed

58
00:01:57,814 --> 00:01:59,015
- to be relieved.
- Good.

59
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:00,316
'Cause... well, we're just happy

60
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:01,651
that you're making some good choices.

61
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:02,985
I know.

62
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:04,987
I totally deserve some bacon, right?

63
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:06,322
I thought you were vegan.

64
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:08,391
Bacon is my downfall.

65
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:09,959
Hey, could you save some
for the linebacker?

66
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,327
All right, I'm off to the White House

67
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,229
to eat more crow about Russia.

68
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,864
I don't get how that's your fault.

69
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:15,998
You happened to be in Russia

70
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:17,066
when Ostrov's widow made a power play.

71
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,535
Exactly. I was there.

72
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,137
They're just mad because
you made a better president.

73
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:23,105
Acting president.

74
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:25,174
MATT: <i>No way, man.</i>

75
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:28,544
The best ramen is Noodle
Noodle Dumpling on H Street.

76
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:30,046
No, hands down.

77
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:31,113
Yes.

78
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:32,848
- Oh, sorry, it jammed last time.
- I see that.

79
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,450
Well, if you want, I
could take a look at it.

80
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:35,651
- Don't have time.
- Okay.

81
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:37,220
I'm not talking to you.

82
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:39,088
Hey, buddy, can I call you back?

83
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:41,390
Okay.

84
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:42,358
Sorry about the printer.

85
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:43,759
It's fine.

86
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,394
Are you sure?

87
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:47,997
Okay, I appreciate that you're
willing to share an office

88
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:49,131
in spite of everything,

89
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:51,334
but I don't think this is working.

90
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:53,269
What? Look, you can
totally have the printer.

91
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,705
And I don't have to be
so loud on the phone.

92
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:56,812
I just think that we'd both

93
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,407
be better at our jobs if
we did them separately,

94
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:00,376
now that we're broken up.

95
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:01,577
Hang on for a sec.

96
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:02,545
Can we talk about this?

97
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:03,546
What is there to talk about?

98
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:05,848
It's over. We need to move on.

99
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,083
Have you seen this?

100
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:09,518
- MATT: Bold graphic.
- It's <i>Inside Lowdown.</i>

101
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,621
Their below the fold is cops twerking.

102
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:14,390
It's bad enough we had
to endure Maria Ostrov

103
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:16,192
accusing the U.S. of
conspiring against Russia,

104
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:19,262
but this makes it look like

105
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:22,365
some <i>Real Housewives</i> episode.

106
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:23,899
DAISY: I'll push back.

107
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,701
But it's hard to take a
stand against a paper

108
00:03:25,702 --> 00:03:26,969
that equates a diplomatic crisis with...

109
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,438
- Cops twerking?
- MATT: Oh, I was gonna say

110
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,973
naked lady mud wrestling.

111
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:32,208
That sounds fun.

112
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,509
What'd I miss?

113
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,549
"Catfight"? Really?

114
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,518
NADINE: We'll push back on that, ma'am.

115
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,920
Why don't we move into
the items of the day?

116
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:46,756
At least I don't look chinny.

117
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:48,251
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

118
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:50,726
The Polar Research Institute of China....

119
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:53,029
- Oh, PRIC.
- ...began construction on a new

120
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,365
weather station in the Svalbard
archipelago in the Arctic.

121
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,834
As long as the station is
researching the effects

122
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:02,305
of climate change, like it
claims, it doesn't warrant

123
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:04,307
further scrutiny by the Arctic Council.

124
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:06,776
But if they try and claim drilling rights

125
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:09,412
or lay claim to any of the
new waters opening up

126
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,447
due to the melting of
the polar ice cap...

127
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:13,548
And we'll be mad because
they beat us to the punch?

128
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,190
Basically.

129
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,002
DAISY: We need to send a cable
to the Foreign Ministry

130
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:19,112
cautioning the Chinese Arctic
and Antarctic Administration.

131
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:20,415
ELIZABETH: Yeah, that's fine.
Let's draft it.

132
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,974
So when did you lose
the lumberjack look?

133
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:25,410
Was that new baby or Neo hipster?

134
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:27,479
- Little of both.
- Welcome back.

135
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,082
In some positive news, I just
got inside word from the Hill.

136
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,084
Looks like our disaster relief bill

137
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:34,953
for Nepal is going to pass tomorrow.

138
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:36,187
- Awesome!
- DAISY: Amazing.

139
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:37,956
- Good work.
- Hey, uh,

140
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:38,593
who caved?

141
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:40,458
Senator Fenworth seems
to have been persuaded.

142
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:41,760
DAISY: We don't persuade.

143
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:43,461
- We inform.
- ELIZABETH: Fenworth. Wasn't he

144
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:45,997
the Tin Man that voted against
subsidized school lunches?

145
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:47,465
Apparently, he was quite moved

146
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:50,001
by his visitation with the
Royal Kumari of Nepal.

147
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:52,237
DAISY: So, seeing all the
devastated villages didn't do it,

148
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:53,371
but five minutes

149
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:54,939
with a 12-year-old
goddess convinced him?

150
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,375
A 12-year-old goddess
who does not speak.

151
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:58,843
MATT: Oh. The Kumari

152
00:04:58,844 --> 00:05:02,080
is mute only when she's
in full ceremonial dress

153
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:05,449
and she's inhabited
by the goddess Taleju.

154
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:07,719
Nobody else reads the briefs?

155
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,387
BLAKE: Ma'am, you should probably

156
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:10,321
leave for the NSC meeting.

157
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:12,257
Right. They keep starting without me.

158
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,858
Oh, you've got a press meet-and-greet

159
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:15,627
with the Kumari after the vote tomorrow.

160
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:17,829
I'll be sure to thank her
for charming Congress

161
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,933
out of its compassion fatigue,
all without saying a word.

162
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,102
I'm sure there's a few cabinet members

163
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:27,138
who believe I could learn
a thing or two from her. Yeah.

164
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,407
CRAIG: <i>So, really,</i>

165
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:31,943
cyber security is just
the tip of the iceberg.

166
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:34,446
JACKSON: Pretty big tip, let's hope.

167
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:37,449
DALTON: Let's catch Elizabeth up.

168
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,128
Craig has come up with a new

169
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:40,295
defense initiative.

170
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:42,097
- Go ahead and lay it out.
- Of course.

171
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:44,299
Now, when my grandfather
went to the Philippines

172
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,167
at the beginning of World War II,

173
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:50,872
he was armed with a rifle
that was designed in 1904.

174
00:05:50,873 --> 00:05:52,807
The next years saw a transformation

175
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:57,078
of U.S. Defense that changed the
shape of geopolitics forever.

176
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,514
And we pretty much haven't
touched it since then.

177
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:01,182
So while we're still spending billions

178
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:03,451
on aircraft carriers and submarines,

179
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:05,987
we're getting cut off at the
knees by a backroom criminal

180
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:07,422
with some malware and a laptop.

181
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:08,890
Or a weather station in the Antarctic.

182
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:11,526
That research station was
approved by the Arctic Council.

183
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,661
How are we seeing it
as an act of aggression?

184
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:15,029
Exactly.

185
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,031
It's under the radar.

186
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:18,900
It's cheap.

187
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:21,403
And for the cost of one
weather station, China gets

188
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:23,271
complete access to our
satellite communications,

189
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,773
and quite possibly

190
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:28,042
shares them with our adversaries
on the Arctic Council,

191
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:29,444
who, as you pointed out,

192
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:31,813
didn't exactly protest this
thing in the first place.

193
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:35,183
So, we're thinking China and
Russia are working together?

194
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:37,986
To undermine our global
security interests?

195
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,487
Does that seem so impossible to you?

196
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:41,823
Look, I get shifting our focus

197
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:44,859
to cyber offense after what
happened with Air Force One,

198
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,296
but battlefield robotics,
laser weapons systems?

199
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,598
What about the impact
that this is going to have

200
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:51,866
on diplomatic relations?

201
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:55,203
Well, to that, I would
say, Madam Secretary...

202
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:57,605
you've had your turn.

203
00:06:57,606 --> 00:07:00,475
And you see where that led us.

204
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:02,911
This is a done deal, Bess.

205
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:06,049
Figure out a way to make it work.

206
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:07,515
CRAIG: Looking at our

207
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:09,417
budgetary goals, this

208
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:11,753
is a three-phase process.

209
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:12,921
First and foremost...

210
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:16,223
Military transformation?

211
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:19,527
So, that's our new foreign policy?

212
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:22,063
It's that damn Air Force One attack.

213
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:26,401
I realize this is a shift in
focus, but it's long overdue.

214
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:29,237
I mean, NASA got a total
overhaul, what, 20 years ago?

215
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:31,339
Meanwhile, Defense is lumbering along

216
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,475
with World War II-era technology

217
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:36,945
while we're being hammered
by cyber attacks.

218
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:39,414
So, when you say "shift in
focus," what does that mean

219
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:40,648
for State?

220
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,050
Re-prioritizing the budget.

221
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,551
Some programs will be affected.

222
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:45,086
How long are we talk...?

223
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:46,387
I can't speak to that.

224
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:47,889
JAY: Let me understand this.

225
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,758
Initiatives that actually
build peace and stability,

226
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,794
like trade agreements,

227
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:56,431
supporting education
and economic growth,

228
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,833
building partnerships and alliances...

229
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:01,035
we're just gonna push some
of that aside so we can

230
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:03,471
focus on spying on everyone better?

231
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:05,473
NADINE: There could be an upside.

232
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:07,442
We'll have less oversight.

233
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,644
Exactly. Think of this
as an opportunity.

234
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:10,945
You know, we can be creative,

235
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,313
fly under the radar,

236
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:15,116
lay groundwork for when things
swing back in our direction.

237
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:16,718
Yeah, until we're all fired
for being redundant.

238
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:19,320
I get that this is frustrating, okay?

239
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:21,689
But this is what's happening,
so we all need to get on board.

240
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,626
Read the proposal and come up
with some ideas and solutions.

241
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:26,528
Thank you.

242
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:29,497
- (door closes)
- We'll reconvene after lunch.

243
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:31,765
(water running)

244
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,776
I'm guessing this is
Sterling's work, ma'am?

245
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:45,513
You know that he thinks that
the Chinese research station

246
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:47,515
is a collusion with Russia

247
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:51,151
to intercept our satellite communications?

248
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:55,023
(sighs)

249
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:57,058
Thank you.

250
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:59,326
You think it's a possibility?

251
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:02,764
Well, put it this way.

252
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:05,934
I read that one of the projects
at the research station

253
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:07,936
is to extract an ice core

254
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:11,639
that's just a little longer
than the one extracted

255
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,207
by the U.S.

256
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,377
It always comes down to who's
got the longer core, doesn't it?

257
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:18,413
I also think

258
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:21,482
we've done our share of
spying on other nations,

259
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:23,284
and I'm not so sure one research station

260
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:26,788
warrants a complete military overhaul.

261
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:29,490
But they don't ask me these questions.

262
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,826
They don't ask me either, anymore.

263
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:33,728
You'll find a way to be heard.

264
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,763
- (door opens)
- DAISY: I'm sorry to interrupt,

265
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:37,198
Madam Secretary.

266
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,433
Oh, the tablet of doom.

267
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:40,335
Better make it quick, while
we still have a budget.

268
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:42,003
It's actually somewhat personal.

269
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:43,504
Oh. Excuse me.

270
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:45,306
(whispering): Thank you.

271
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:47,208
One of my contacts at the <i>Chronicle</i>

272
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,344
just forwarded a query
that's going around.

273
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:51,846
- (door closes)
- It seems to... well,

274
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:55,216
it seems to be from someone
in possession of...

275
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:56,918
Spit it out, Daisy.

276
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,886
Someone is trying to sell
photos of your daughter

277
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:00,888
and the president's son being... intimate.

278
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:03,324
- What?!
- They included

279
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:05,360
one photo as proof, but once the seller

280
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:06,628
gets paid, they're promising more.

281
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:08,929
- More than this?
- Everything.

282
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:18,392
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

283
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:27,358
Find out everyone who got this query.

284
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,794
I want a full list.
Does Russell Jackson know yet?

285
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,368
I literally just found
out two minutes ago.

286
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,764
I want us in front of it with him.

287
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,800
Come on, Henry, pick up.

288
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,201
We can kill this, right?

289
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:38,703
We're gonna do everything
we can, obviously,

290
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,571
but with the teaser photo
already out there...

291
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:41,639
Teaser photo?

292
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,974
- Like an ad campaign?
- I'm sorry.

293
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,343
Ma'am, Russell Jackson wants to see you

294
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,477
in his office.

295
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:47,778
He says it's extremely urgent.

296
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,480
So much for getting in front of it.

297
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:51,816
JACKSON: We've contacted
every outlet that got the query.

298
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,684
If they make the purchase,

299
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:56,120
they'll feel the full force
of the Executive Branch.

300
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:58,556
But isn't Harrison enough
of a public figure

301
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,691
that they can claim fair use?

302
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:03,694
Not if I have anything to do with it.

303
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:06,998
Half an hour ago, I thought
Maria Ostrov was the only thing

304
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,301
that could hijack the news cycle
and run down our poll numbers.

305
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,004
You thinking this is another
hack, like Air Force One?

306
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,271
This wasn't a hack.

307
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:16,907
The president's son lost his phone

308
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,843
last week, didn't bother to tell anybody.

309
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,245
Didn't it have a-a password or...?

310
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:24,615
Apparently, he thought
they were inconvenient.

311
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:26,183
We need to move forward.

312
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:27,918
I need you to talk to Stevie,

313
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,654
find out what else we're looking at.

314
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,255
God forbid there's video.

315
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:32,923
And you're gonna talk
to Harrison, too, right?

316
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:34,392
Just so we're clear on who did what?

317
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,394
I don't really give a damn who did what.

318
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,062
Yes, we're talking to
Harrison the heroin addict.

319
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:45,036
We need to corroborate
so we can contain the blast.

320
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,070
Get me a report.

321
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,012
Obviously this is a
matter we need to treat

322
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:56,847
with the highest degree of sensitivity.

323
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:58,849
This is a potential criminal
act against two people

324
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,518
who happen to be related
to public figures.

325
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,253
The incident is currently
under investigation

326
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,288
and we have nothing more to add.

327
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,090
But this is assuming the photos get out.

328
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,259
We're up against freedom
of the press on that.

329
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,593
We're doing everything we can

330
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:10,995
to find the source and lock this down.

331
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,663
Legally.

332
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:13,731
Thank you.

333
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,900
Everybody, sit back down.

334
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,636
I'm not here to tell you what
to do in your off hours.

335
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,638
But you know what I'm about to say.

336
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,740
If any of you have any digital evidence

337
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,241
on any of your devices anywhere

338
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:26,243
that you don't want everyone to see,

339
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:28,245
now is the time to delete it.

340
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:30,514
Print out a copy for your private records,

341
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:32,950
lock it in a drawer,
but no digital footprint.

342
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,085
NADINE: Okay.

343
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,019
Thank you, everyone.

344
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:43,627
So... if I'm on Tinder,

345
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:45,995
that's not a... a problem, right?

346
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:48,733
Um, I would say,

347
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,402
unless there's something
obscene in your profile

348
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,537
then, by all means, date away.

349
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:55,505
Okay, cool.

350
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,776
It's not weird that I
asked you that, is it?

351
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,777
Of course not.

352
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,779
I appreciate the heads-up.

353
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,914
Okay.

354
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:05,216
I'm gonna...

355
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,917
Yeah.

356
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:08,852
That was weird.

357
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:13,390
But how?

358
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,459
HENRY: Well, apparently
he lost his phone,

359
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,894
and it fell into the wrong hands.

360
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,896
Now I know why he was calling

361
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,331
from all those other numbers.

362
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,733
ELIZABETH: Sweetie, it's completely
wrong that this happened,

363
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,435
but now we have to deal with it.

364
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,536
Can you tell me what else is on there?

365
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,175
I'm gonna get us some coffee.

366
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:36,247
Um, what do you mean, "What else"?

367
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:40,918
Well, the guy, whoever took the phone,

368
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,953
sent out one of the photos.

369
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,555
It's already out there?!

370
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,423
Not yet.

371
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:49,960
"Sent" more like, "proof
that there's more."

372
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:52,029
(groaning): Oh, my God.

373
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,365
You're both in bed, nothing's showing.

374
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,002
But I need to know what else
there is so I can manage it.

375
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,238
Um...

376
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:03,808
I don't know, I-I don't remember.

377
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,376
Baby, I get that this is hard,

378
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,010
but the White House needs to know.

379
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:12,750
Harrison said he was gonna delete them.

380
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,918
He promised me.

381
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,619
I mean, we were just goofing around.

382
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,654
It was not a big deal.

383
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,222
It was one time.

384
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:19,623
- So there is nudity?
- Nothing gross.

385
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:23,561
But, yeah, we were in bed, so yes.

386
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,529
Were you guys...?

387
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,566
I mean, they're...
they're gonna probably ask...

388
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,267
were you guys doing anything?

389
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:31,268
Of course not.

390
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:32,369
It was after.

391
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,805
Thank you.

392
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:37,240
Mom, I'm sorry.

393
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,143
So am I.

394
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:48,785
- Hey.
- Hey.

395
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:56,160
You remember that weekend at Falls Lake?

396
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,162
Oh, of course.

397
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,996
(chuckles)

398
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:03,266
Thank God there was no Internet.

399
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:07,471
- This is different.
- Is it?

400
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:10,808
Yes. I work for the president
of the United States,

401
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,444
who's running for re-election.
She can't just pretend

402
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,379
she's not aware of that anymore.

403
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,383
And, I mean, how many dumb
moves are we gonna give her?

404
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:23,187
How far does it have to go for
her to realize what's at stake?

405
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,323
And not just for her but for all of us.

406
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:28,025
It sucks that this happened. I get that.

407
00:15:28,026 --> 00:15:30,761
But is it really her job to prevent it?

408
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,029
Yes! Everybody knows

409
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,932
you don't put nudie
pictures on your telephone.

410
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,868
- Cell phone.
- Whatever.

411
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:42,305
- (sighs)
- This puzzle is ridiculously hard.

412
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:45,308
What?

413
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:48,746
If these pictures get out,

414
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,682
you know what the world
would do to Stevie.

415
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,018
I just hate to see you do it first.

416
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,320
- What's that?
- Blame her.

417
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,290
Morning. So, I have a draft
of that diplomatic cable

418
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,864
about the Chinese weather
station in the Arctic.

419
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:10,605
Right.

420
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:13,828
But... we can do this another time.

421
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:15,397
Are those doughnuts?

422
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,898
Bagels.

423
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,500
That'll do.

424
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:22,270
JAY: We're already using "Welcome
to <i>the Arctic research community"</i>

425
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,673
to say, "Don't even think
about drilling up there."

426
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:26,675
But you really want to
try to implicate Russia

427
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:29,611
- for letting them in, on top of that?
- Just a whiff of it.

428
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:31,079
Something like, um,

429
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,550
"Protecting the diplomatic integrity of...

430
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:38,620
"the Arctic is the chief objective

431
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,623
"of the Arctic Council
and the United States.

432
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:45,660
So, you know, don't try
anything with Russia."

433
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:49,331
First of all, Russia's almost
as territorial as China is.

434
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:51,333
There's no way they're gonna share

435
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:53,101
all their new shipping lanes
with another superpower

436
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:55,770
- once the polar ice cap melts.
- I know, right? Total fiction.

437
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:58,173
Can I ask why we're ringing that bell?

438
00:16:58,174 --> 00:17:01,109
I'm told it'll play well.

439
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,210
You're just in time.

440
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:03,578
He's introducing Henry.

441
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:06,881
Madam Secretary, I am so sorry.

442
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:08,416
Oh, no.

443
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:13,488
The photo that was sent with
the query has appeared online.

444
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:14,189
Where?

445
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,156
For the moment,

446
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:16,858
a user-generated news site.

447
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,426
Relatively low-profile.

448
00:17:18,427 --> 00:17:21,496
All of the other photos
are still under wraps.

449
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:22,964
But now that word's out...

450
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:25,333
DAISY: It's only a matter of
time till someone buys the rest.

451
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:27,235
There has to be something we can do.

452
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:29,604
NADINE: Well, I've reached out
to Russell Jackson's office.

453
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:31,840
We can move your afternoon commitments

454
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,410
and make a task force.

455
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:35,369
Let's not change the schedule.
The president wants everything

456
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,812
- to move forward as usual.
- It might be best

457
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:41,049
to reschedule the meet and greet
with the Royal Kumari of Nepal.

458
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,317
Why's that?

459
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:45,120
Um...

460
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:49,858
it's a devoutly religious country.

461
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:51,726
She's a virgin goddess.

462
00:17:51,727 --> 00:17:54,029
Well, let's just hope

463
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,132
the prepubescent virgin
goddess who lives in a temple

464
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:00,468
doesn't spend much time on the Internet.

465
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:01,903
The meeting stays.

466
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:04,072
HOST: There really is so
much to mine, isn't there,

467
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:06,741
in this liminal border
between the Christian

468
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:08,176
and the Muslim worlds.

469
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:10,178
Well, it's precisely the
blurriness in this moment

470
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:11,980
of transition where we can see

471
00:18:11,981 --> 00:18:15,116
the common sources behind so much

472
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:17,619
of our cultural and spiritual conflict.

473
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,988
Mm. Like stumbling onto
a wealth of scrolls

474
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:21,690
preserved in a cave.

475
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:23,458
Well, sure, yeah.

476
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:26,061
Why don't we open things
up to our callers?

477
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:28,129
- Jeff from Fair Oaks.
- JEFF: Yes, hi.

478
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,964
Go ahead with Dr. Henry McCord.

479
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:31,166
Hi, Jeff.

480
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,934
JEFF: Uh, I've been listening to you talk

481
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:34,636
about the moral codes of Christianity

482
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:36,538
and Islam. And I think
it's so interesting

483
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,707
that you hold yourself up
as an expert on morality

484
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,543
when all I'm finding online
about you is a photo

485
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:43,111
of your daughter rolling around in bed

486
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:45,380
- with the president's son.
- Excuse me?

487
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:47,716
- I'm sorry. Uh, Jeff, we lost our conne...
- No, no, let me finish.

488
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:50,085
Is that your definition of
moral parenting, Dr. McCord?

489
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:53,221
- Is that your definition?
- No, no, I'd like to answer that.

490
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:54,854
You ask an interesting question, Jeff.

491
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:56,491
I'd like to start by making a distinction

492
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:58,126
that I usually make
on the very first day

493
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:00,028
of my Morals and Ethics class.

494
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:02,664
A lot of people say that
morals are how we treat

495
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:04,733
the people we know and
ethics are how we treat

496
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:05,867
the people we don't know.

497
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:08,903
So morals are what
make us a good parent,

498
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:11,072
a good friend, a nice neighbor.

499
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:13,408
But ethics are how we build a society.

500
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:16,611
That's the true test of our higher self.

501
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:19,414
But what happens, Jeff,
when society is ruled

502
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:23,051
by the subjective morals of, say, you

503
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:25,220
and your family and you
choose to project that

504
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:28,089
onto complete strangers is that
we all end up with a society

505
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,724
that's governed by self-aggrandizement.

506
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:31,493
- So, really, by calling
- Oh...

507
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:33,128
to make sure you're the
first little pedant to jump

508
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,630
off your chair and teach me a lesson

509
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,599
with smug superiority about

510
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,300
your own particular moral point of view

511
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:41,269
when you know precisely
nothing of the situation,

512
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,404
you've done your part to contribute

513
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:46,541
to the erosion of our
entire social fabric.

514
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:47,942
Pat yourself

515
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:49,677
on the back. Bravo.

516
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:52,180
HOST: Uh, so we are...
going to take a break.

517
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:54,748
I'm gonna go make some calls.

518
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,879
- Do I want to know how bad it is?
- It's just the one photo.

519
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,914
Somebody leaked it.

520
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,615
The rest are still under wraps.

521
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:11,218
I mean how bad did I
make things for you?

522
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:13,620
You're still my hero.

523
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:15,222
No, I'm not. I went off
like a hopped up undergrad.

524
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:18,191
You did what I have been wanting to do

525
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:21,561
all day. Instead, I have
to listen to my staff imply

526
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:24,765
that I shouldn't be sitting down
with a virgin goddess from Nepal

527
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,199
while my slutty daughter

528
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,702
- is all over the Internet.
- Not you.

529
00:20:28,703 --> 00:20:30,304
You have a meeting with a Kumari?

530
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:31,939
He knows what a Kumari is.

531
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,140
Don't

532
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:34,508
ever change.

533
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:35,275
How old is she?

534
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,476
12. Almost ready

535
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:38,745
to retire. Okay, I'm getting more

536
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:41,882
- "bad news" face. Hold on.
- No further news on your daughter, ma'am.

537
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:44,418
But I just got word from the Hill.
It now looks

538
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:47,988
like the disaster relief
bill is not going to pass.

539
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:51,258
(sighs) Henry, I got to go. Bye.

540
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:54,294
What happened to the Tin Man?
I thought we had the Tin Man.

541
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,496
This morning, when the
president's numbers dropped,

542
00:20:56,497 --> 00:20:57,764
three more senators

543
00:20:57,765 --> 00:20:59,766
took the opportunity
to flip their positions.

544
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:02,636
Over a photo sex scandal?

545
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,504
The vote will be up again in January.

546
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:06,673
By which time thousands
of people will have died

547
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:07,975
of exposure and disease.

548
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,242
Well, at least now

549
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:10,510
you have a good excuse to cancel

550
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,879
my photo op with the virgin goddess.

551
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,147
The Kumari and

552
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,083
her entourage have already arrived.

553
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:19,653
I will send the press away
and break the news privately.

554
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,253
No.

555
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,291
I will tell her.

556
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:26,725
Thank you.

557
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,700
It is an honor, Kumari.

558
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:36,336
Kumari is pleased to meet
you, Madam Secretary.

559
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,904
We were expecting a bit more press.

560
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,243
I know the honor

561
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,578
of the presence of the Kumari

562
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:46,179
brought a great deal of attention

563
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,347
to the plight of Nepal

564
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,984
after the terrible
disaster you've endured.

565
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:53,487
But unfortunately,

566
00:21:53,488 --> 00:21:55,989
support for the additional aid package

567
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,392
will not be approved by the U.S.
Congress today.

568
00:21:58,393 --> 00:22:00,027
That is not what we were led

569
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,728
- to expect.
- The conditions

570
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,762
have changed, unfortunately.

571
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:09,269
We will revisit the
proposal as soon as we can.

572
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,773
I hope you will accept
my deepest apology

573
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:16,208
and sympathy for your people.

574
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,715
It is her blessing.

575
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:43,937
No.

576
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:46,339
I'm done. No more bad news.

577
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,210
The president has invited
you and Dr. McCord

578
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:53,413
to join him and the First Lady
for dinner at the White House

579
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,015
this evening.

580
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:56,249
Is that it?

581
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,352
I can try to find some bad news.

582
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:00,754
No need.

583
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:05,157
Pretty sure that dinner
invitation is bad news enough.

584
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,294
What's up?

585
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:09,328
Would you close the door, please?

586
00:23:11,031 --> 00:23:14,334
So, I'm trying to delete a file

587
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:16,970
- of old photos...
- Mm-hmm.

588
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:19,072
...but ever since I
switched to the cloud...

589
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:21,441
- They keep coming back?
- Like a bad penny.

590
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,410
I've had this.

591
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:25,312
Okay, let's go to your cloud preferences.

592
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:26,646
Did that.

593
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:28,715
Okay, now select the
ones you want to kill.

594
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:31,116
- Uh...
- Oh. (laughs)

595
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:34,855
What we're gonna do is, we're
gonna create a ghost file.

596
00:23:34,856 --> 00:23:37,157
- Um...
- I'm not looking, swear.

597
00:23:37,158 --> 00:23:39,426
There's nothing unsavory.

598
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:42,162
It's just, thought I'd get rid

599
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:44,030
of the hanging chads... so to speak.

600
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:45,365
Oh, I get it.

601
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:48,301
You don't want to be looking
at these things at 2:00 a.m.

602
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,337
after a glass of wine
and too much Adele.

603
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:52,205
Not that I speak from experience.

604
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:54,207
Scotch and Joni Mitchell for me.

605
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,276
For what it's worth,

606
00:23:56,277 --> 00:23:59,746
it's only brutal for the first year.

607
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:01,014
Okay, can I ask?

608
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:02,616
How can I be his ideal woman,

609
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:04,317
and five minutes after we break up,

610
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,652
he's dating some barista

611
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,387
who can't even properly use
the possessive apostrophe?

612
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:09,289
Did you Facebook stalk?

613
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,625
No. A little.

614
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:14,661
Well, whoever she is,

615
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,230
she's probably very simple

616
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:19,199
and very needy,

617
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,201
and that's exactly what
he wants right now.

618
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:23,803
You know you could do the same.

619
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:26,907
That cyber security guy
clearly has an eye for you.

620
00:24:26,908 --> 00:24:29,543
No, he doesn't. Does he?

621
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:31,511
So, that's my problem?

622
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,146
I'm not needy enough?

623
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:35,849
It's in their DNA. They want
to feel like we need them.

624
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,017
You realize

625
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:39,186
the entire feminist
movement would have us hung

626
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,353
for this conversation.

627
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:44,224
Well, a fish may not
need a bicycle, but...

628
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:49,462
Gloria Steinem probably never
spent Saturday night alone

629
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:51,730
at Bed Bath & Beyond.

630
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:54,935
Whoa. The good suit, huh?

631
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:57,037
Oh, I figure, mea culpa
dinner with the president.

632
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,307
- Yeah.
- I don't know that it's <i>your</i> mea culpa.

633
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:01,875
(shouting): Kids! Pizza!

634
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,276
Don't get me wrong.

635
00:25:03,277 --> 00:25:05,245
That was a spectacular rant, but

636
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:06,713
I haven't heard any fallout.

637
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,782
So, if a tree falls on C-SPAN,
does it make a sound?

638
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:09,950
Is that what you're saying?

639
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:11,418
Ooh, pizza.

640
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:13,820
Listen, we're going out to the
White House tonight for dinner.

641
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:16,456
Ooh, Dad's getting called
into the principal's office?

642
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:17,691
What does that mean?

643
00:25:17,692 --> 00:25:19,259
Please. Your epic TV rant?

644
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,560
What epic rant?

645
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,028
Check it out. Dad's a gif.

646
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:25,131
You've officially made it.

647
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,499
Great.

648
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,968
Jace, are you okay?

649
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:30,370
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just sore from practice.

650
00:25:30,371 --> 00:25:33,039
All right, listen, kids, I
don't know how much you know,

651
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,708
but something really
uncool happened to Stevie.

652
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:36,276
We know. The picture's everywhere.

653
00:25:36,277 --> 00:25:38,311
I just don't see what the big deal is.

654
00:25:38,312 --> 00:25:40,080
Well, the big deal is

655
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,749
that it's a gross invasion of privacy

656
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,751
but, unfortunately, something
that we may have to deal with

657
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,820
'cause our family's in the
public eye and all that.

658
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:50,023
But we are doing what we can to
keep it from moving forward.

659
00:25:50,024 --> 00:25:51,791
- Okay? Just... yeah.
- Yeah, so just be sensitive, all right?

660
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:53,193
- ALISON: Of course. Yeah.
- It'll all blow over

661
00:25:53,194 --> 00:25:54,661
as soon as a cooler gif comes along.

662
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:56,196
- Hey, guys.
- Dude, pizza.

663
00:25:56,197 --> 00:25:57,731
Oh, I'm not doing cheese.

664
00:25:57,732 --> 00:25:59,332
And you're back to vegan.

665
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,269
ELIZABETH: Listen, we're going
out, so you guys are on your own.

666
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,138
Get to bed on time. I
am speaking to you, sir.

667
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:06,406
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

668
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:08,707
- Bye.
- Bye, sweets.

669
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,112
Okay, who wants to watch a movie?

670
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,246
- Oh, I'm down.
- Not me.

671
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,822
My mother always insisted that
vichyssoise was only for summer,

672
00:26:22,823 --> 00:26:24,257
but I find it very comforting.

673
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:26,293
Oh, we could certainly
use a little comfort.

674
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,894
Thank you, Lydia.

675
00:26:27,895 --> 00:26:29,195
HENRY: Again, Conrad,

676
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:31,164
I am so sorry for losing it today.

677
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:32,365
We're all on edge.

678
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:34,401
How's everybody doing at home?

679
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:35,902
Holding our breath, I'd say.

680
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:37,671
Any news on who might
have the photographs?

681
00:26:37,672 --> 00:26:40,307
Not yet, which is why
we need to be ready

682
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,676
for this to get worse...
as early as tomorrow.

683
00:26:42,677 --> 00:26:44,878
- That sounds ominous.
- What are you thinking?

684
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:47,380
Well, we'd, uh, like to
put Stevie and Harrison

685
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:48,948
on the morning news.

686
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:50,450
Just a short interview

687
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:52,385
as a couple. Get out in front of it.

688
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:53,887
As a couple?

689
00:26:53,888 --> 00:26:55,388
LYDIA: The team thinks it plays

690
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:58,024
best if we see them as two
young people in love,

691
00:26:58,025 --> 00:26:59,893
regretful for their choices,
but laughing it off.

692
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:01,761
We'd have to hit just the right tone, but

693
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:02,962
our people can work with them.

694
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:05,932
You are aware they broke
up a few weeks ago.

695
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:07,967
Well, does their relationship
status need to come up, really?

696
00:27:07,968 --> 00:27:09,469
Not if they're posing.

697
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,037
DALTON: This thing has put us

698
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:12,872
in a tough spot, Bess.

699
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:14,407
It's a five-minute interview.

700
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:15,709
Harrison has already agreed.

701
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,244
Of course he has. I'm sorry,

702
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:20,680
but we all know that Harrison
has nothing to lose.

703
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,782
I mean, at worst he's a recovering addict

704
00:27:22,783 --> 00:27:24,117
with a hot girlfriend.

705
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:27,153
But Stevie will be the
slut who loses everything.

706
00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:29,389
For crying out loud, Bess,
will you help me solve

707
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,690
one damn problem that you've caused?

708
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,759
HENRY: Okay, Conrad, our
kids took naked pictures

709
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,993
of themselves in bed.

710
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:35,762
What on earth does that
have to do with Elizabeth?

711
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:37,197
It's Russia. It's Russia.

712
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,733
I was there when Maria
Ostrov seized power, so,

713
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:40,934
suddenly, now everything's my fault.

714
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:42,569
Do we need to bring
matters of state into this?

715
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,270
You opened Pandora's box over there!

716
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:46,072
Now, I'm Pandora? What'd they do to her?

717
00:27:46,073 --> 00:27:47,774
- Chain her to a rock?
- That was Prometheus.

718
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:49,008
DALTON: You had to push

719
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:50,076
your agenda with Ukraine.

720
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:51,911
- Which almost worked!
- It was too big a risk!

721
00:27:51,912 --> 00:27:54,147
Last I heard, that's why
you brought me in here!

722
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:55,915
- Guys, we're getting off topic here.
- All I'm saying is

723
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,350
that we need to right the ship.

724
00:27:57,351 --> 00:27:59,119
And I'd love a little cooperation,

725
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,387
for both our kids' sakes.

726
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:03,590
So, putting Stevie on
national television to apologize

727
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:06,059
for the horrible crime of being violated...

728
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,161
that's gonna right the
ship, or is she just

729
00:28:08,162 --> 00:28:10,514
apologizing for being sexual?
I'm a little unclear.

730
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:12,732
LYDIA: No one is going to think
anything less of Stevie.

731
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:13,933
Well, that's a big relief.

732
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:16,236
We're just trying to
manage the embarrassment.

733
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,338
Oh, Lydia, I think that ship has sailed.

734
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,739
After your outburst today,
I'd have to agree.

735
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,107
What?

736
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:23,243
Now we're blaming Henry
for defending his daughter?

737
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,711
Why don't we talk about the fact

738
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:26,212
that your son has an unsecured phone?

739
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:27,380
Who'd like another cocktail?

740
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:29,048
- I would.
- Me.

741
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:32,452
Well, thank God for Lydia Dalton.

742
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:35,588
That woman is a first-class WASP.

743
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,291
Never underestimate the
power of gin and denial.

744
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:39,459
(laughs) You know what?

745
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,661
Actually, I would love a nightcap.

746
00:28:41,662 --> 00:28:44,063
While I write my letter of resignation.

747
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:45,498
Now, come on!

748
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:47,367
Conrad doesn't want to lose you.

749
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:48,868
Just let the dust settle.

750
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:53,206
Henry, I all but called the
president's son a junkie loser.

751
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:56,209
STEVIE: Hi.

752
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,978
ELIZABETH: Oh, hey. I didn't

753
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:01,014
see you there, sweetie....

754
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:03,016
(sighs)

755
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:05,585
It's okay. He is a loser.

756
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:08,087
And for five minutes tomorrow morning,

757
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:09,989
he will still be my boyfriend.

758
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,025
ELIZABETH: No, sweetie.

759
00:29:12,026 --> 00:29:14,060
You're not gonna do that.

760
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:16,162
I already told Harrison I would.

761
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:18,231
No, no. Your mom and I killed it.

762
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:20,300
They're gonna come up
with another strategy.

763
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,269
I don't want to be strategized,
I don't want to be managed.

764
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,938
I don't even care what's true anymore.

765
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:26,206
Hey.

766
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:29,542
One of the feminist groups
on campus made posters of me

767
00:29:29,543 --> 00:29:31,444
like I'm some kind of hero.

768
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:33,546
And then one of the
fraternities went around

769
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:36,148
and put "#TeamMcCord" on all of them.

770
00:29:36,883 --> 00:29:39,786
That stupid photo is everywhere.

771
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:41,321
Dad's losing it on TV,

772
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,856
Jason won't even look at me.

773
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:45,290
(sighs) I just want my life back.

774
00:30:11,284 --> 00:30:13,685
(groans softly)

775
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,323
(sighs)

776
00:30:21,794 --> 00:30:23,830
I recommend the puzzle.

777
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:27,233
Well, it's a defense budget proposal.

778
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:31,704
If this can't put me out, nothing can.

779
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,106
Hmm. (sighs)

780
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:42,781
Wait a minute.

781
00:30:49,452 --> 00:30:50,623
Oh, hey, Admiral Hill?

782
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,525
Oh, Madam Secretary.

783
00:30:52,526 --> 00:30:54,594
I wonder if I might
get a minute with you

784
00:30:54,595 --> 00:30:56,162
to go over the budget proposal?

785
00:30:56,163 --> 00:30:58,898
I'm still catching up on it
myself, but, yes, of course.

786
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,267
Oh, great. Okay, 'cause
I want to show you.

787
00:31:01,268 --> 00:31:02,869
Right here...

788
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,537
on page 204,

789
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:07,513
we get into breakdown
on specific weaponry.

790
00:31:07,514 --> 00:31:08,474
Yes.

791
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:10,443
I know what Sterling said...

792
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:12,745
that we're looking to go
all stealth and cheap

793
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,213
and fast,

794
00:31:14,214 --> 00:31:16,215
but what is all this?

795
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:18,751
It's old-school, heavy-duty military gear.

796
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:22,388
It's-it's aircraft carriers,
tanks, dozens of choppers.

797
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:25,158
Sterling knows that he has
to sell this to the brass.

798
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:28,561
And this is what the
generals understand.

799
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:31,931
But it's more than half the budget.

800
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,701
This old ship turns slowly.

801
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:36,968
(laughs)

802
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:40,439
Let me ask you something, Ellen.

803
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:44,944
You agree with Sterling's initiative?

804
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:49,782
Do I think that Chinese weather
station is a spy outpost?

805
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,884
Probably not.

806
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:54,687
But I do think

807
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:59,057
that this is how wars are going
to be fought in the future.

808
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:05,363
Thank you, Admiral.

809
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:08,401
Shakya, I'm glad I caught you.

810
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:11,304
Could I possibly get two
minutes with the Kumari?

811
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:12,605
SHAKYA: I'm afraid not,

812
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:13,906
Madam Secretary. We are just leaving.

813
00:32:13,907 --> 00:32:16,708
Pramila, can I speak
with you for a minute?

814
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,216
I'm sorry.

815
00:32:23,217 --> 00:32:26,451
I want to help your country.

816
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,858
You have one minute.

817
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:34,159
Thank you.

818
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:37,229
(door closes)

819
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,903
Pramila, listen to me.

820
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:46,205
Very soon after you return home,

821
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:48,541
your time as a Kumari will be finished.

822
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:50,977
But you still have time
to help your people.

823
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:54,746
You still have great power,
and I want to help you use it.

824
00:32:56,382 --> 00:32:58,351
Go on.

825
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:02,088
All I need is your blessing.

826
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:04,123
If the prime minister comes to you

827
00:33:04,124 --> 00:33:07,960
about a building project in
the Himalayas, smile upon it.

828
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:10,196
SHAKYA: Madam Secretary,

829
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,031
the Kumari is a divinity.

830
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,366
She does not rule

831
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:16,105
in matters of state.
{This is not your domain.}

832
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,937
Thank you.

833
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:20,205
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

834
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:25,812
You can do a lot more than they say.

835
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:28,014
Your blessing could save thousands

836
00:33:28,015 --> 00:33:30,315
of lives.

837
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,035
There's my linebacker.
You up for a breakfast burrito?

838
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:53,271
Nah, just, uh, cereal.
I'm laying off the protein.

839
00:33:53,272 --> 00:33:54,873
Best way to heal sore muscles.

840
00:33:54,874 --> 00:33:56,908
I'm dropping football.

841
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,510
What?

842
00:33:58,511 --> 00:34:00,445
You just made the team,
like, two weeks ago.

843
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:03,381
I wanted to make friends.
These idiots aren't my friends.

844
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:06,084
Okay, you're telling me
that there's not a single kid

845
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,752
on that team that's not a jerk?

846
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:10,488
They made fun of Stevie, Dad,
right in front of my face.

847
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,823
And I did nothing.

848
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:14,960
Makes me even worse than they are.

849
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:17,028
You just want to smash' em, right?

850
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:18,630
Yeah.

851
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:21,600
Just can't stop thinking about
it, how great it would feel.

852
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,602
Pretty great.

853
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,004
It would for...

854
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:28,273
maybe an hour.

855
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,309
Here's the thing.

856
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,579
It wouldn't change anything.

857
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,549
And then there's the whole part
about you getting kicked out

858
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,917
of another school for fighting.

859
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:41,453
So just letting them talk
about Stevie that way,

860
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,721
that's the right thing to do?

861
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:45,223
Jace, every group you're ever gonna be in

862
00:34:45,224 --> 00:34:47,392
is gonna have at least one jerk.

863
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:50,695
And you're gonna have to learn
how to deal with them, okay?

864
00:34:50,696 --> 00:34:55,333
Not by quitting and definitely
not by beating anybody up.

865
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:57,268
Have a burrito.

866
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,803
Take it out on the other team.

867
00:35:01,997 --> 00:35:03,808
I'm sure I'm just being overly cautious,

868
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,521
with all the breaches
that have been happening.

869
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:06,511
Oh, no.

870
00:35:06,512 --> 00:35:09,781
We like overly cautious.
Uh, where's the zombie file?

871
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:11,449
Uh, right here.

872
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,884
I've put it in the trash, like, ten times,

873
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:15,387
- but every time I open the application...
- Right.

874
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:18,223
So, what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a ghost file.

875
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:20,291
Hmm. A "ghost file."

876
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,726
It's kind of surprising...

877
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:23,962
the press coordinator
of the State Department

878
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:25,930
doesn't know how to delete
a file from the cloud.

879
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:28,233
I-I probably could have figured it out,

880
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:29,801
but I've been <i>really</i>

881
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:31,436
- busy.
- No, it's cool.

882
00:35:31,437 --> 00:35:34,706
I mean, yeah, I'll go out with you.

883
00:35:34,707 --> 00:35:35,589
(chuckling): Um...

884
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,709
No, we can go to
lunch right now. I've been

885
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,911
working on this awesome
new encryption software,

886
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:43,081
and I promise to only talk
about it for ten minutes tops.

887
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:45,383
I think I could be free.

888
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:48,185
Cool. Shall we?

889
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:54,426
Just so you know, I knew how to do that.

890
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:56,794
God, I hope so.

891
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,098
Look who's first to school.

892
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,735
Um, Lucy let me in. I hope
that's okay, Mr. President.

893
00:36:03,736 --> 00:36:05,937
So what's this proposal?

894
00:36:05,938 --> 00:36:09,007
Yeah. Um...

895
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:12,844
So, in going over the proposed
budget for Craig's military

896
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:14,846
transformation initiative,

897
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:17,682
I, uh, saw an opportunity

898
00:36:17,683 --> 00:36:20,952
where I thought State might
be able to contribute, using

899
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:23,588
our diplomatic relations with Nepal.

900
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:25,557
I proposed to their prime minister

901
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,759
the idea of an observatory

902
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,095
in the Himalayas. It is

903
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:32,030
a highly strategic spot for optical,

904
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:34,199
infrared, and gamma ray observation.

905
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,135
It's strategic, all right. It's
right on the border of China.

906
00:36:37,136 --> 00:36:39,037
Which is why Nepal will
never sign off on it.

907
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,538
They've got a relationship to protect.

908
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:43,875
They also have needs in the
wake of the earthquakes.

909
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:45,977
I've gotten word back
from the prime minister

910
00:36:45,978 --> 00:36:47,679
that he's open to the idea,

911
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,216
provided we pay a yearly fee
for use of the land, roughly

912
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:53,051
the same amount we were hoping to approve

913
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:54,719
in the disaster relief bill.

914
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,190
The question, of course, is... budget.

915
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:00,492
(clears throat)

916
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:03,228
One... Just one second. Um,

917
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:08,333
for the cost of ten Joint
Light Tactical Vehicles,

918
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:10,602
we could invest in the peaceful
observation of the heavens

919
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,370
with three new telescopes

920
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:15,573
and also answer China's
encroachment at the Arctic

921
00:37:15,574 --> 00:37:17,942
with a message of our own.

922
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:20,178
- Ten JLTVs, huh?
- Yeah.

923
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:22,781
The budget calls for 400.

924
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,817
I think 390 should do it.

925
00:37:25,818 --> 00:37:27,485
What do you think, Craig?

926
00:37:27,486 --> 00:37:29,287
Well, it's strategic,

927
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,055
it sends a message to China,

928
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:33,091
and it's cheap.

929
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:36,059
What's not to like?

930
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:38,963
Reach out to NASA.

931
00:37:38,964 --> 00:37:39,931
Get it in motion.

932
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:41,833
Absolutely, Mr. President.

933
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:45,469
And, Elizabeth, if I
could, uh, get a moment.

934
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:50,608
Mr. President, I am
sorry about my behavior

935
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:53,378
last night. It was totally inappropriate.

936
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:55,046
Lucy,

937
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:58,148
could you have, uh, Henry come in?

938
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:02,053
Hello, Conrad.

939
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:04,055
Hi there.

940
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:06,558
I wanted to tell you both
that there was a breakthrough

941
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,359
in this photo situation.

942
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,296
The query letter was traced back
to a former Secret Service agent

943
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:13,498
who was released from duty last month.

944
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,302
Seems this was his, uh,
way to even the score.

945
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:20,071
So that's it? The photos are contained?

946
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:22,440
We've stopped the sale of the photos,

947
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:25,109
and the guy is being held at a
local precinct for questioning.

948
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,778
But we're sure they're gone for good?

949
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:29,681
As sure as we can be.

950
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,517
I owe you both an apology.

951
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,220
I don't think this situation brought out

952
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:37,322
the best in a lot of us.

953
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:39,891
I'm sorry for the way we handled it.

954
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:42,160
Thanks, Conrad.

955
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:43,862
May I make a request?

956
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,863
What is it?

957
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,799
Before you finish questioning this guy,

958
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,301
15 minutes alone with him, off the radar.

959
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:54,805
You got it.

960
00:38:59,477 --> 00:39:02,780
Well, that was very <i>Godfather.</i>

961
00:39:02,781 --> 00:39:05,950
We thinking piano wire or bare hands?

962
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:09,220
I haven't decided yet.

963
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,590
Is it wrong that I find it kind of hot?

964
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:15,559
Don't answer that.

965
00:39:17,262 --> 00:39:19,763
(chuckles)

966
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:27,685
(siren wailing in distance)

967
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,016
You good?

968
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,770
I'm Stephanie.

969
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:08,405
I'm Ronald Watson.

970
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:12,143
I don't really know what to say.

971
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:14,012
I've been having a bad time.

972
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:16,281
But that's-that's not an excuse.

973
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:18,316
I heard about your misdemeanor.

974
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:21,286
I was kind of surprised

975
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:24,022
that's all you got, actually.

976
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:26,124
And a fine.

977
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:29,427
Oh. And a fine.

978
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:31,329
How much?

979
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,964
$500.

980
00:40:32,965 --> 00:40:35,867
(scoffs)

981
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:39,370
So that's like, what, half a month's

982
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:41,506
rent? Or...

983
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:44,175
a new camera?

984
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,543
You could have taken your own pictures.

985
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,313
I didn't mean to hurt you.

986
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,469
(sighs) So did you not think about that

987
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:57,364
when you were trying to sell my
privacy to the highest bidder?

988
00:40:57,365 --> 00:40:59,831
Was I just... not real to you?

989
00:41:04,905 --> 00:41:06,372
Elizabeth.

990
00:41:06,604 --> 00:41:09,439
Here we go.

991
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,907
Craig.

992
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:13,843
I wanted to thank you for
that proposal on Nepal.

993
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:16,412
Oh, good. I'm glad it found your support.

994
00:41:16,413 --> 00:41:18,915
It's exactly the way we
need to be moving forward.

995
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,583
I'm so glad we're finally finding a way

996
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:23,618
- to work on the same team.
- Thanks, Craig. Me, too.

997
00:41:24,554 --> 00:41:27,623
Which is why I don't ever
want to hear you say

998
00:41:27,624 --> 00:41:30,091
it's not my turn again.

999
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:33,328
We should grab that lunch, though.

1000
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:35,798
Absolutely.

1001
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:37,667
Mr. Sterling, that
meeting's in ten minutes.

1002
00:41:37,668 --> 00:41:38,935
RONALD: <i>I was mad.</i>

1003
00:41:38,936 --> 00:41:41,003
About other things.

1004
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:43,105
Again, it's not an excuse.

1005
00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:44,773
I heard that you lost your job.

1006
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:48,845
They said that I was intoxicated on duty.

1007
00:41:48,846 --> 00:41:50,713
But I wasn't. I would never do that.

1008
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:54,382
I've worked for three presidents.

1009
00:41:55,117 --> 00:41:57,854
Must be hard on your family.

1010
00:41:57,855 --> 00:42:01,257
My son's out of the house.

1011
00:42:01,258 --> 00:42:03,525
So it's just me now.

1012
00:42:05,228 --> 00:42:07,430
How old is he?

1013
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:08,731
He's 20.

1014
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:09,966
Is he in school?

1015
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:14,170
Taking some... time off for the moment.

1016
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:17,372
Look, I don't know what
exactly you want from me.

1017
00:42:18,407 --> 00:42:21,444
I don't want anything, Ronald.

1018
00:42:21,445 --> 00:42:23,712
We're just talking.

1019
00:42:24,513 --> 00:42:28,484
I just wanted to get to
know you as a person.

1020
00:42:28,485 --> 00:42:32,121
So I wouldn't...

1021
00:42:32,122 --> 00:42:33,990
reduce you

1022
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:36,058
to one stupid thing

1023
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:38,760
that you did.

1024
00:42:40,363 --> 00:42:43,665
See how that works?

1025
00:42:55,344 --> 00:42:57,679
- Hey.
- Hey.

1026
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:01,851
You okay?

1027
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:03,853
Yeah.

1028
00:43:03,854 --> 00:43:06,154
I am.
