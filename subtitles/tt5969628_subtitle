1
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,880
'Their nights'

2
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,840
You are on top of a
13-storey building, Sir.

3
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,200
13 goons have surrounded you
with weapons in both hands.

4
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,000
You take...
- Wait! Wait!

5
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,240
Am I wearing sunglasses
in this scene?

6
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,120
Yes, Sir.
- That's not needed!

7
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,880
You have a feeling that I wear
sunglasses anywhere and everywhere.

8
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,200
It's not like that.

9
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,800
Ashiq wears sunglasses
only when necessary!

10
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,760
Go, correct your
script and come back!

11
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,200
Sir, well..
- Hey!

12
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Including this, this
is the 17th time..

13
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,280
I won't let you inside
this caravan hereafter.

14
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,920
Sir, let me read it.
Sir, please.

15
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Whatever!

16
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,880
So, you look into the
eyes of each one of them.

17
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,600
Suddenly, someone who looks exactly
like you comes from behind them.

18
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,040
When you look at him, you see another
Sir who looks exactly like you, Sir.

19
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,320
That Sir is pointing
a gun towards you.

20
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,640
And you are startled,
not knowing what to do, Sir.

21
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,120
That's when that Sir looks at you
and laughs hysterically, Sir.

22
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
Boisterous laughter!

23
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,480
And you're waiting without
realizing what's going on.

24
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
You stand there shocked,
for one minute.

25
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
And you decide to take
the risk and point..

26
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,360
We are on the sets of the film 'Cappuccino'
directed by Koshi Sir right now.

27
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,520
Ashiq is the hero of this film.

28
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
A bike racing scene is
about to be shot here.

29
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,880
Go straight till here.

30
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Okay?

31
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,080
Ashiq, are you ready?

32
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
I'll do it!

33
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Ready, Sir.

34
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,800
Move all the people from there.
Clear the crowd.

35
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Ashiq,
- Sir!

36
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,400
Just go behind that bike till there.
Till that tree.

37
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,120
Rest we can capture
in a wide shot.

38
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Okay?

39
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,360
Okay! Ready!

40
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,160
JK, clear the crowd
from the field.

41
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Start camera!

42
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Rolling.

43
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Action.

44
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
Cut.

45
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Ashiq, cut!

46
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,680
Cut it!

47
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,760
Where's that loser going?
Bloody hell!

48
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,400
He has been a headache
ever since he gave dates.

49
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Shit!

50
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
Sir, shall we call
him on his phone?

51
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,040
There's no use!

52
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,880
When has he ever
picked up his phone?

53
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,400
Whose phone has he picked up?

54
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,040
Phone! Bullshit!

55
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,200
Is it the same one?

56
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,880
It was during the shooting of
director Koshi's latest film,

57
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,440
that actor Ashiq left the location
and created a controversy.

58
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,440
Director Koshi
responded saying that

59
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,120
all the new generation stars
including Ashiq are arrogant.

60
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,080
He said that escaping the location
was a heinous and immature act,

61
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,600
and that he will never do a film with Ashiq
ever again; during the press conference.

62
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
What happened to him?

63
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,280
All these are gimmicks to
get people into theatres!

64
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,000
Doesn't he have any other job?

65
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,320
He wants free publicity!

66
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,840
Change the channel, dad.

67
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,320
(On TV) There's an allegation that many new
stars in Malayalam Cinema are arrogant.

68
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,160
Does Ashiq's act prove
that allegation?

69
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
What is your response to this?

70
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,080
I had called Ashiq to
find what the truth is.

71
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,760
But I couldn't get
through to him.

72
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,280
So, I'm not reacting right now.

73
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,200
I don't think actor Ashiq
would do something like that.

74
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,960
Thank you, Mr. Manoj. His response
is that Ashiq would not do such a thing.

75
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,640
To talk further about the incident,
director Koshi is with us now.

76
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,479
Mr. Koshi, why did Ashiq leave
from the location of your movie?

77
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,680
Koshi, can you hear me?

78
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,360
I think director Koshi's isn't
with us on the phone anymore.

79
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,280
We are dealing with U.S. based
clients at this call centre.

80
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,320
Their nights, are our days.

81
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,760
And we are dealing
with their bank cards;

82
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,840
And their card is their money.

83
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,680
So we should be very careful
about their card numbers.

84
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,200
Customer confidentiality should be

85
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,400
our first priority.

86
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So,

87
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,320
once you hit the floor,

88
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,240
you're not allowed to use pens,
paper, pencils, mobiles,

89
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,840
or anything like that.

90
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
And you're not
supposed to remember

91
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,800
or note down their card numbers.

92
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,320
If anyone does anything like that,

93
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,480
that's a security breach according
to the company's policy.

94
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,320
And that employee who
commits such an of fence,

95
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,320
will be terminated immediately.

96
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,840
And one more thing;

97
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,040
another thing which you should be aware
of, while attending calls from clients;

98
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,120
They don't like to
repeat what they said.

99
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,360
So you should not get
distracted by anything.

100
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Like this.

101
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Excuse me.

102
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,840
- Dude.
- Hello Sid.

103
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Did you know?

104
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,240
What's new about this?

105
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,480
Doesn't he do this always?

106
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,000
Look into that poster carefully.

107
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,160
Saw it?
Did you see it?

108
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,120
Dude, isn't it the same thing?

109
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Right?

110
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,520
Let's go and find him.

111
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,880
'At the end of every journey,

112
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,480
a story comes in search of us'

113
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,600
'But in this case, it
was just the opposite'

114
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
'We are in search of a story'

115
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,880
'Scobo Jones' story'

116
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,800
'To be frank,

117
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,040
this is a journey
to find the answer

118
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,680
to a riddle that came
to us three years back'

119
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,120
'By us, I mean..

120
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Siddharth,

121
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,880
Ashiq,

122
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
and me'

123
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,360
Vijay.
3 years back, Bangalore.

124
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,280
Ain't that great!

125
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Oh! This guy?

126
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
Why doesn't he take the lift?

127
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,240
What is this?
Is he a robot?

128
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
It's nothing,

129
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
but a game with numbers.

130
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,920
If you get the first four
digits of your card number,

131
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,920
you should be able to
recognize the card type.

132
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,880
Whether it's VISA,

133
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Master,

134
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
or Amex card.

135
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,240
Those are the keys to
the customer's mind.

136
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,840
Call me when you're bored.

137
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,000
What's happening?

138
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
What?

139
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Number..

140
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Get out!

141
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
I'm sorry, Sir.

142
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,920
Get out of my class.

143
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,840
Anyway I'm leaving.
So let me get her number as well.

144
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,800
Get the f**k out of my class!

145
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,560
(Remix of a classic Ilaiyaraja Song)

146
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,760
It's been 3 days since
I came to Bangalore.

147
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,320
Don't you have anything
to say, Vijay?

148
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,120
How is Bangalore?

149
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,280
I haven't come to
visit Bangalore.

150
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,480
I'm sorry, Meghna.

151
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,720
Sorry for what?

152
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Vijay,

153
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm talking to you.

154
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,280
Meghna, I need some time.

155
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,840
It's almost six months now.

156
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,080
What problem do you have that
you can't tell me, Vijay?

157
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,880
I will tell you; but not now!

158
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,480
I'm not in a mood to talk now.

159
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Please.

160
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Okay.

161
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,720
My flight is at 4 AM.

162
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,720
It's my parents' wedding
anniversary tomorrow.

163
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,280
I have to get back.

164
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,200
And I'll be waiting for your call.

165
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
You're suspended
for three months.

166
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,560
I don't think you can survive
here with this attitude.

167
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,320
I think you need a break anyway.

168
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,880
Consider these three months as a
time to rethink about everything.

169
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
But,

170
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,000
if you don't compromise
this case in the meanwhile,

171
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,640
we will be forced to
dismiss you, Vijay.

172
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Hey Vijay.

173
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,880
Before anger starts controlling us,

174
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,480
it would be better if we
start controlling our anger.

175
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,680
And do it before it's too late.

176
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,360
'Kochi wasn't new to me'

177
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
'But,

178
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,960
for Ashiq, Kochi was full of dreams'

179
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,200
'Even though the world has moved on
from the hurries of the 21st century,

180
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,480
Pattavayal and Ashiq had just started
celebrating the 80's even then'

181
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,560
'The humble beginning of the artist
called Ashiq was from there'

182
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,640
'3 years back,

183
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,880
if I took a bus to
escape from my life;

184
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,680
Ashiq reached Kochi with the
burden of many dreams'

185
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,960
(Ashiq, 3 years back, Pattavayal) The
pride of Sembakamani Arts & Sports Club,

186
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,479
the darling son of Pattavayal,

187
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
the new king of expressions;

188
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,920
the gifted prince;

189
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,359
the heart-throb of girls;

190
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,440
Yes. The one you have all
been impatiently waiting for,

191
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440
the epitome of acting,

192
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,680
Ashiq's mesmerizing
performances.

193
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,840
Come on, clap your hands!

194
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,000
Come on, clap!

195
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,200
Once Rajumon asked me,
(imitating Mohanlal)

196
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,520
who my father was.

197
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,920
I told him that my father was

198
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,480
a king!

199
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,560
A king with a crown and a sceptre.

200
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,360
Yes, I am a prince!

201
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
The son of the king.

202
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,320
Shit!
(imitating Suresh Gopi)

203
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,960
- Your encouragement is our victory!

204
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,400
The real India is not the India that you have
learnt from books. (Imitating Mammootty)

205
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,240
The India of the poor
and the destitute.

206
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,560
The India of those who sell
their body for a meal.

207
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,720
The soul of that India,

208
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,000
To realize that;

209
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,440
you need some sense,

210
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
sensibility,

211
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,760
and sensitivity.

212
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,840
'And then, one day..

213
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,920
Ashiq happened to see that event.

214
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,840
That major event.'

215
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Cut it!

216
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,760
Hey! Sir!

217
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,920
- Is it okay, Sir?
- Sir!

218
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Yes. It's okay.

219
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
Sir!

220
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,280
Tell him, dude.
- Vishnu, it's okay.

221
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,240
We're going to shoot a
lengthy sequence next.

222
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,720
Dude, does this have the photo in
front of Taj Mahal? - Yes, give it!

223
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,800
The song sequence comes after that.
- Sir!

224
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,520
Sir, I am a popular
actor in this town.

225
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,040
These are my photos.
- Aravind!

226
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,800
Sir, can you see them.
- I'll see. Come!

227
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,080
If he sees it, he will like me.
In his next film..

228
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,760
Every expression is there.

229
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,320
This is action!

230
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,000
This is romance.

231
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,120
Isn't that awesome?

232
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,840
This is my special.

233
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,560
It's because I have just
one pair of sunglasses.

234
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,320
The expressions are all good.

235
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,760
But in cinema, there would
be certain expenses.

236
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,560
Rs.50,000/-

237
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,160
Cinema is the life of Pattavayal.

238
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,440
But we haven't contributed
anything to the world of cinema.

239
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,720
Ashiq was born only
to become an actor.

240
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
This is our golden opportunity.

241
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,320
If we pay 50,000,

242
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,240
the movie people have promised
to get Ashiq into movies.

243
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,680
In this Pattavayal village,

244
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,680
no artist should lose a chance to grow,
just because he doesn't have money.

245
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,440
If Ashiq becomes a big actor,

246
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
our village will also become
famous along with him!

247
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,600
So, this Panchayat has decided to donate
money for him and send him to Kochi.

248
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,200
Our Ashiq is leaving, mom.

249
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,800
Ashiq, this is not just money.

250
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,600
It's the heart of Pattavayal.

251
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,240
Become a great actor
and come back!

252
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Son,

253
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,760
have your meals on time.

254
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,640
Spend the money carefully.

255
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,720
Don't smoke or drink.

256
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,800
Remember your mother always.

257
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Mom!

258
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Ashiq,

259
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,000
Kochi is a big world of cinema.

260
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,240
There will be many people
to help you there.

261
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,520
If you become a big actor,

262
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,760
don't forget us, buddy.

263
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,840
What is this, dude?
- Ashiq!

264
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,520
I cannot bear this.

265
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,720
Did someone die?

266
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Hey!

267
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,080
You have decided to become
a movie star, right?

268
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,560
You are going to a world which was ruled by
Sathyan Master, Bharath Gopi & Thilakan Sir

269
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,120
Acting is not the buffoonery
that you do here.

270
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,520
Don't go there and bring
shame to Pattavayal.

271
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,040
I'll tell you one more thing.
Remember that.

272
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,080
It may help you.

273
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
A good actor

274
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,840
should be a good reader.

275
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,560
Only a person with knowledge can
claim his place, wherever it is.

276
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Go!

277
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,840
A good actor should be a good reader.

278
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,320
Only a person with knowledge can
claim his place, wherever it is.

279
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,440
I will come back only after
becoming a great actor!

280
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,480
'That's how Ashiq reached Kochi'

281
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,080
'Ashiq, who came with the style
and moral values of the 80's,

282
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,960
was welcomed in a rather
different way by Kochi'

283
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Ready Sir!

284
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,800
Sound!

285
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Cut it!

286
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,840
What is this, man?

287
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,720
What's that fellow doing?
- I'll check, Sir.

288
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Sir, please.

289
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,960
These people land up from nowhere!

290
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,160
What are you doing?
Don't you know how to dance?

291
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,880
Sir, they started early.

292
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,400
It's not that. If you don't
know it, go outside.

293
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,520
Don't trouble us.

294
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,160
I can do this, Sir. I do
this back in my town.

295
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,440
Dance properly, or
I'll throw you out.

296
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Cut it!

297
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,440
What is this, bro?
You went wrong again?

298
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,880
What are you doing, man?

299
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,760
Enough of your nonsense!
Stop it! Get out!

300
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,520
Enough!
- Just one more chance, Sir.

301
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,040
Just one more time, Sir.

302
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Cut it!

303
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,080
Throw him out!
- Okay Sir.

304
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,280
- Isn't it simple?
- You stupid fool.

305
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,720
Get out! Go learn how
to dance & come back.

306
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,720
Sir, I'll do well
in the next one.

307
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,360
Don't say anything more.

308
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,440
I can't give the money back.

309
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,400
The make-up itself
costed around Rs.1 lakh.

310
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,360
'If our story began three years back,

311
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,840
Siddharth's story had begun
six years back itself'

312
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,240
We are watching the final match of the
Inter University Cricket Tournament.

313
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,880
Farooq College's super batsman
Siddharth is at the crease.

314
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,080
Siddharth is the Captain
of Farooq College team,

315
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,360
who led them to victory
for the past 2 years.

316
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,160
This is Siddharth's third
consecutive 50 in this tournament.

317
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,640
Up next, bowling from
the College Road end,

318
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,240
is College of Commerce's
captain & main bowler Venu.

319
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,000
Stopping Venu from
delivering the ball,

320
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,320
Siddharth is greetings his fans!

321
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,840
I think he hasn't had
enough of celebrations.

322
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,640
We can see this as a clever
move by Siddharth

323
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,240
to dishearten the opposite team.

324
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,440
Ready! Come on!

325
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,280
Farooq College needs just 2
runs to win from the last over.

326
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,880
But they can lose any wicket.

327
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,040
Siddharth who won the cup for Farooq
College for 2 consecutive years;

328
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,080
We are all hoping that he would win
the cup for them this year as well!

329
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,320
They need just 2 runs
to win in 6 balls.

330
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,320
All hopes are pinned
on Siddharth.

331
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,280
Farooq College is just 2
runs away from victory.

332
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,640
But I'm reminding all of you that
they have only one wicket left.

333
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,560
The audience is waiting
in excitement!

334
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,960
Siddharth! Siddharth!

335
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,560
Come on, Siddharth!

336
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,960
That was a full toss ball which
could have easily been struck.

337
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,640
The error he made in
judging the ball;

338
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,480
will he pay a huge
price for that?

339
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,240
That's what we have to wait for!

340
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,720
If Siddharth is not
able to get up again,

341
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,760
College of Commerce will
be declared as the winners.

342
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,920
Venu & team are waiting for the
announcement of their victory.

343
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,320
College of Commerce has almost
confirmed their victory.

344
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,240
But Siddharth is not
ready to let them win;

345
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,600
he is back on the crease again!

346
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,560
Come on!
Same ball! Same area!

347
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,760
Come on!
Same ball! Same area!

348
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,920
Same ball! Same area!

349
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,280
Bowled!

350
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,240
Siddharth has lost his
wicket on Venu's ball.

351
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,720
Farooq College has lost the match
which they were almost about to win.

352
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,400
- I knew that he'll screw up, when he
started showing off too much on the ground.

353
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,800
Good that it happened.

354
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,120
- Even hearing the word 'ball'
would be allergic to him now. Poor guy!

355
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,840
How will he play cricket
without a ball now?

356
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,760
- He had so many
girls as his fans!

357
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,480
- Now none of them would
even look at him!

358
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,160
'It is said that the actual story begins
when you think that everything is over'

359
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,520
'On that day,
at that ground;

360
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
a cricket ball

361
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,160
decided Siddharth's fate'

362
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,520
'Like the first break-up,

363
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,080
the first humiliation
that he faced in life,

364
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,880
turned Siddharth into a nobody'

365
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,680
What is all this?

366
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,960
This is Idly & Sambar.

367
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,240
Mom, what's this?

368
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,800
I know what it is.

369
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,240
It's because your brother's hard work
in Dubai & my toil here in the farm,

370
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,680
that all these are
on this table.

371
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,080
But if you stay closed in
your room all the time,

372
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,680
none of these would
be on this table.

373
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,560
Dad is asking about
your future plans.

374
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,440
I don't have any such future plans.

375
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,680
If I find something,
I'll let you both know.

376
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh! Is that so?

377
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,080
Then you do something, my son.

378
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,840
Until you find out what
you're going to do with your life,

379
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,960
you don't have to
enter this house.

380
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,039
We will be here until then.

381
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,999
What are you doing?

382
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,319
Call him back!

383
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,960
- What is this, Siddharth?

384
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,479
- What all are you doing?

385
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,920
Dad is also asking
the same thing.

386
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,360
- Don't you know how dad is?

387
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
- You do one thing.

388
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,120
- Don't stay there anymore.

389
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,560
- Move to a different
place for some time. That's better.

390
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,880
- Find a job and live
how you want to.

391
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,000
- Until then, I'll send you
the money for your expenses.

392
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,360
- Find a job and live
how you want to.

393
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,320
- Until then, I'll send you
the money for your expenses.

394
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,680
Live how you want to.
I'll send the money.

395
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,560
'If our story has to be told,

396
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,640
a fourth person's story
also needs to be told'

397
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,160
'Even though the story was ours,

398
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,080
he was the hero in it'

399
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,600
'3 years back,

400
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,320
when we tried to escape from our
lives because of our problems,

401
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,000
he was enjoying his life
with many new surprises'

'Scobo Jones'

(3 years back)

405
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,480
(Plays a sensuous song from
'Avalude Ravukal/ Her Nights')

406
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Hi!

407
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Coffee?

408
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,960
Busy.
Next time.

409
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
See!

410
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,200
Your Papa has
prepared food today.

411
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,200
Then I can eat
something tasty today.

412
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,280
Look at him, Papa.
He's making fun of my cooking.

413
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,280
If so, I'm not cooking anymore!

414
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,240
I cannot keep cooking for your Papa.
Find someone else for that.

415
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,680
It's because I am
busy with my work.

416
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,400
Where will I send him?

417
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,720
Talk softly.

418
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,640
He will hear us.
- I don't care.

419
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,160
If this goes on, I'll go to my house.

420
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,440
Go wherever you want to.

421
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,600
I just need some peace of mind.

422
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,080
Grandpa, don't watch
the news channel!

423
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,120
I want to watch Pogo TV.

424
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,360
Grandpa, I don't
want Pogo channel.

425
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,160
I want to watch cartoons.

426
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,240
From a TV Serial - I can
understand what's on your mind.

427
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,160
I can feel your heartache.

428
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,040
But..

429
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,120
We are helpless, mom.

430
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,600
It's not like we didn't try.

431
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
(Get lost @♪!$)

432
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
'That night,

433
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,640
a new idea was born in Scobo's mind'

434
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,160
'Haven't you heard that an
idea can change your life?'

435
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,440
'Such an idea'

436
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,240
'Even though the idea was
born in Scobo's mind,

437
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,680
it ended up changing our lives'

438
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Mr. Siddharth, you shouldn't
hide anything from your doctor.

439
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,480
Only then, I can prescribe a treatment
which would be apt for you.

440
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,080
Tell me.
What is your problem?

441
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,520
That..

442
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,560
I..

443
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,960
Tell me without any fear. This
is not a court, to be scared.

444
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,000
Doctor, I'm not even sure if
what I have is a problem.

445
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,600
Let it be there.

446
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,480
If I say this to someone,

447
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,160
either they would
laugh out loud,

448
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,880
or else they would beat me up.

449
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,000
This is why it is said that you shouldn't
make faces when you run out of answers.

450
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,120
And, doctors like us are
here to solve such problems.

451
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,840
I want to know what
your actual problem is.

452
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
Doctor..

453
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,880
I don't know how to say that..

454
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,040
You have a mouth, right?

455
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,440
You usually say everything
with your mouth, right?

456
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,880
So tell me like that.

457
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,920
Doctor..

458
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,920
Maybe, it is because
of my age, right?

459
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,600
I will decide if it is because
of your age or something else!

460
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,160
Tell me what it is first!

461
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Tell me!

462
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
Doctor..

463
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,080
I..

464
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,080
Any lady whom I see,

465
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,720
I get attracted to them.

466
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,720
I imagine how they
would actually be like..

467
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,760
I mean.. Without...

468
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,480
I imagine that unknowingly.

469
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,800
Hey!

470
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,640
I suspect that I'm turning
into a psycho-maniac

471
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,480
like they show in English movies.

472
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,400
What a wonderful disease!

473
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,080
I think,

474
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,960
almost all the young
men in Kerala,

475
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,200
have this problem now.

476
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,080
Really?

477
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Let that be.

478
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,680
Is it there when
you see everyone?

479
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
Like that..

480
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
I mean..

481
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,760
When you see ladies of all ages?

482
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,880
Can you imagine how
everyone would be like?

483
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,200
You lucky fellow!

484
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
Well,

485
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,040
it's not a problem!

486
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,880
It's not a problem at all!

487
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,200
Really?
- Jayetta!

488
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Yes?

489
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,320
What is it, Bindu?

490
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,560
I already told you many times.

491
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,720
We have to reach early at
least for today's function.

492
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,880
We promised that we would reach there by 3.
And it's already past 3.

493
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,920
When will we reach there?

494
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,920
After everything is over?

495
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,200
It will be past five, by the
time the party starts, dear.

496
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,200
Why should we go so early?

497
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,880
Don't break the door by hitting
it with your shoulder.

498
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,000
My dear Bindu, this
is my last patient.

499
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,000
We shall definitely
leave after this.

500
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,240
Promise?
- I swear on you!

501
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,320
Then I'll wait outside.

502
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,880
No rent, no deposit, no agreement.

503
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,680
So many facilities for free?

504
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,720
Let me try calling.

505
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,720
Number.

506
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,520
There's no number?

507
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,160
There's something tricky about this.

508
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,680
I have the money.

509
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,320
I have a house now.

510
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,440
Time for a change-over.

511
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,800
What is this?
A love letter?

512
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,000
No rent.

513
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,320
No deposit.

514
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,400
No agreement.

515
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,000
There's something tricky about this.

516
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,960
Love is strength.

517
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,200
It changes something into
something even better.

518
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,360
It influences even the
soul of the nature.

519
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
Alchemist.

520
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,360
Those are lines from
'The Alchemist'.

521
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,560
Page number 98.

522
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,640
'Pain is, the breaking of the
shell that wrap your notions'

523
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,160
Tea & Parippuvada!

524
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,240
Whose book is that?

525
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,520
Arrange the books according to
the years they were published.

526
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,920
No rent,

527
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,160
no deposit,

528
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,360
no agreement.

529
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,320
What kind of ad is this?

530
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,840
6 up,
5 down.

531
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,600
9 up,
4 down.

532
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,680
Hey dude,

533
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,480
you forgot to add the contact details.

534
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,040
How can I contact you?

535
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,120
Is this some kind of game?

536
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,240
6 up,
5 down.

537
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,160
9 up..
4 down..

538
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,720
I have to crack this.

539
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
Shit!

540
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,960
2 down.. 2 down..
1 up.. 1 up..

541
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,240
2 down.

542
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,840
1 up.

543
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,680
1 up.
2 down.

544
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,800
1 up.
2 down.

545
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,120
Okay.

546
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,240
6 up.

547
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,000
5 down.

548
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,040
That is 1.

549
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,440
9 up.

550
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,400
4 down.
That's 5.

551
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,160
'We reached there through
those three paths'

552
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,520
'But..

553
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,080
We got something else also from there,
which Scobo hadn't mentioned in the ad'

554
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,520
Yes.

555
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,880
Snacks ready!

556
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,160
Dude, if you sit at home all the time
just because you lost some money;

557
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,960
no one is going to bring
an opportunity here.

558
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,240
Go out & try going
for some auditions!

559
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,040
There's no point in going for auditions.

560
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,160
You'll know that only
if you go, right?

561
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,280
Even a couple of superstars in Malayalam
came through these auditions.

562
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,960
Of course!

563
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,840
Superstar?
Who? Him?

564
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,520
With this look?

565
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,800
I doubt if he would become
anything at all in his life!

566
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,320
Then I'll become like you.

567
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,640
Not doing any work;

568
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,040
cheating your own brother;

569
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,800
staring shamelessly at the b**bs &
b**ts of every woman in this world;

570
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,000
Dude, you need some
ambition in life!

571
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,000
Only then, you'll understand
the pain of people like me.

572
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,240
Now I understood something.

573
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,200
Even if he doesn't
become a superstar,

574
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,600
he can become a good actor.

575
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,840
By being tensed
throughout the life,

576
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,040
what's the point of being a
superstar at this old man's age?

577
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,040
Old man?

578
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,600
You know what your problem is?

579
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,680
Do you know?

580
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,760
I'll tell you.

581
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Ambition.

582
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,280
Learn from me. I don't have ambition.
I don't have any tension!

583
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,600
I suggest that none of
us should have ambition!

584
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,240
Water.

585
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,880
You don't need ambition;

586
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,720
but having some sense
would be good.

587
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,880
That's right!

588
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,880
So you had so much sense while
breaking that guy's head?

589
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,440
Are you clapping?

590
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,920
Hey! Don't laugh much!

591
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,440
If you had so much sense, would you
let out such a huge house for free?

592
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,480
That's right.

593
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,560
So my mistake is giving such
a set-up to you for free?

594
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,320
Well, let's see!

595
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,760
You break his head with this!

596
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,480
Let him have some
sense at least then.

597
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,080
Don't hit him.
It will break.

598
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,720
There's a hammer inside.
I'll bring that.

599
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,800
'With a lot of happiness,
and small quarrels,

600
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,080
a friendship had started
forming between us'

601
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,120
'And that brought many
changes to us, unknowingly'

602
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,760
'Forgetting many things,
we started smiling again'

603
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,280
Hello brother!

604
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,400
I've submitted my resume for a job.

605
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,840
I don't know if I would get it.

606
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,480
Bro, I'm in the middle of an interview.
I'll call you back. Ok. Bye.

607
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,040
Dude, I'll tell you if its a problem
that can't be solved after hearing it.

608
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,240
Before that, you need to be sure that
this problem needs to be solved.

609
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,640
Yes.

610
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,200
Or it will be a bigger problem.

611
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Tell me then.

612
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Well..

613
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,440
An interview recommended
by my brother.

614
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,480
If I attend the interview,

615
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,160
the job is confirmed.

616
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,800
If I don't attend it,

617
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,400
he won't send me money anymore.

618
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Over here.

619
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,640
That means, you don't need the job now.
- Right!

620
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,360
Dude, it's difficult to get a job.

621
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,440
There are many ways through
which you won't get it.

622
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,400
Is it? Then tell me, please.

623
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,160
I'll tell you.

624
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,560
But you should do something for me.
- I'll do whatever you want.

625
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,520
There are 2 solutions
to any problem.

626
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,720
One will be easy,

627
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,280
and one will be difficult.

628
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,520
Which one do you want?

629
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,280
I don't want any difficulty.

630
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,320
Tell me the easy way out.

631
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,800
Okay. I'll tell you the easy way.

632
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,160
You should go and
attend the interview.

633
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,560
And, to the interviewer,
you should say that;

634
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,680
you imagine all the women in the world;
don't you tell us?

635
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,840
Tell them that you
imagine women like that!

636
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,040
After that, no one in their right mind
would give you the job. I'm sure!

637
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,640
What about my brother?

638
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,000
We'll solve that later.

639
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

640
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,400
- Where were you?

641
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,000
- Such a huge traffic block.

642
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,920
That's right!

643
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,880
I'll attend the interview anyway.

644
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,200
Now what should I do for you?

645
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,520
Make-over.

646
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,040
Make-over?

647
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,000
This is slightly complicated.

648
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,960
They are claiming that you did
it for a personal revenge.

649
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,240
And there are witnesses as well.

650
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,760
If you go forward with this
case, your career will be over.

651
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,360
What can we do, Sir?

652
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,720
Let me talk to their advocate first.

653
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,240
I'll try to arrange
a meeting with them.

654
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,000
Anyway, it will be better to
do an out of court settlement.

655
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,880
Bro!

656
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,880
2 plates of Parotta & Beef.

657
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,920
You have money, right?
- Yes!

658
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So what I was saying is that..

659
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,800
Even the name matters.

660
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,760
Our name should create an impact
to the people hearing it.

661
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,720
For example,

662
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,800
Mammootty.

663
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,200
What's wrong with Mammootty?
- Nothing wrong!

664
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,600
Let us talk.

665
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,880
Moha..

666
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,960
Or leave it.

667
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,440
Listen to my name itself.

668
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,400
Vinod Mannarkkad.

669
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,160
There's something about it
when you hear it, right? - Yes.

670
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,920
That something..

671
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,040
Your name doesn't have it.
That's the problem.

672
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,880
Ashiq Pattavayal.

673
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,880
Very bad!

674
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,280
Don't worry.

675
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,160
I have found a solution.

676
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,560
Whenever someone asks your name,

677
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,560
say that it's Aashiq Abu.

678
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,920
Aashiq Abu?

679
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,080
Isn't that a director's name?
- Yes.

680
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,120
That's what I also meant.

681
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,080
Like you were shocked
hearing this name,

682
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,520
others would also be shocked.

683
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,560
Moreover,

684
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,160
these directors will see you as
a new-generation guy.

685
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,800
Using this name, you can enter anywhere.

686
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,720
You don't want beef, right?

687
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,320
You should be dieting.

688
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,360
Tea & parotta are great.
Have it!

689
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,200
Since 3 films flopped
consecutively,

690
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,240
he is going to make a
movie with newcomers.

691
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,160
But Manoj Sir is still a tiger!

692
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,840
What you said is
correct, Vinodettan!

693
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,400
But how do we approach Manoj Sir?

694
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,200
I have found out a way to do that.

695
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,240
How?

696
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,720
At CCM college,

697
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,920
an acting workshop for 30 days.

698
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,920
Manoj Sir is organizing it.

699
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,960
It will be our

700
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,160
passport and Visa to cinema.

701
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,640
Is it?
- Ya!

702
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,720
Dream on!

703
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,800
Tomorrow you will be an actor!

704
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,920
Superstar Aashiq Abu!

705
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,360
May I..

706
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,400
Shivani

707
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,080
Oh God, she's quite an item!

708
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,080
What do I do?

709
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,400
Shall I join the job here?

710
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,840
No!!

711
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,720
My values shouldn't be
surrendered for a girl.

712
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,200
True!

713
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,800
I don't find any qualifying
performance in your certificates,

714
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,720
to work in our company.

715
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,680
Okay.

716
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,440
But it's only because there
is a strong recommendation,

717
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,880
you reached so far.

718
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,400
There has been a 3 years gap
after your engineering course.

719
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,640
What were you doing then?

720
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,240
Nothing much. I just wanted some rest.

721
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,280
I studied a lot, right?

722
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,320
Since I studied for 4 years continuously,
I thought I should need some rest.

723
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,840
Sorry. I didn't get you!

724
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,440
Rest after studies?

725
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,400
Ya. A little!
Just 3 years.

726
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,440
I graduated in the same year
that you also graduated.

727
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,000
And I am the senior
manager here.

728
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,240
And you are still looking for a job!

729
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,680
Lazy people like you are our
country's biggest curse!

730
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,800
Do you know that?

731
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,320
See madam, have you ever
thought about your life?

732
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,000
Study hard in school &
college and pass the exams,

733
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,400
and start a job immediately;

734
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,800
and after that, to the next goal.

735
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,600
I mean, it's such a boring life!

736
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,160
According to me, we shouldn't
have ambitions in life.

737
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,760
Only then we can continue
living without fear.

738
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Oh!

739
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,840
So Sir, who does not have ambitions;

740
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,480
how do you live?

741
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,800
Simple.

742
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,600
We just have to see this
world how we want to.

743
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,240
For example,

744
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,760
when I entered this room;

745
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,840
I didn't look at your face, madam.

746
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,920
No! Not that.
I didn't mean that.

747
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,040
I look only at whatever
I like to see.

748
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,480
Thank you.

749
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,960
Manoj Sir, who had the good heart to
take classes for you about acting;

750
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Has it started?

751
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,520
I express the since gratitude to Manoj Sir,

752
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,480
on behalf of all of you,
this institution and myself.

753
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,680
Without wasting more time,

754
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,040
I humbly invite Manoj Sir, for whom
you all have been waiting for.

755
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,840
Namaste.

756
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,840
- Namaste.

757
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,360
Hearing that this is a
coaching class for 30 days,

758
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,360
many of you would have
misunderstood it.

759
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,760
So this is not that place?

760
01:03:54,440 --> 01:04:00,680
If any of you think that you can
study all aspects of acting in 30 days,

761
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,720
that's totally wrong!

762
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,560
There are no shortcuts in acting!

763
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,800
Not just me,

764
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:12,280
no one in this world can
teach acting to anyone.

765
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,000
I think we've lost our money!

766
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,440
With this acting coaching for 30 days,

767
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,680
what we intend here;

768
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:23,320
is to wake up the artist
sleeping within you.

769
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,320
There is an actor in
every person.

770
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,480
There is an actor hidden in all 16
of you, who have gathered here.

771
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,800
However much you are able to
bring that out,

772
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,320
you would be able to turn into
an actor that much.

773
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,640
Experience will make you a better actor.

774
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,560
Tomorrow, a role which you
would get in a movie;

775
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,120
however small or big it may be;

776
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:55,000
the perfection and honesty in
your approach towards that role;

777
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,280
will make you a good actor.

778
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,360
In cinema, there are no small roles.

779
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,920
There are only bad actors.

780
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,240
I think he has watched
my short film.

781
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,520
And,

782
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,920
if you attain a
position in cinema,

783
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,400
it's natural for many
to have a feeling

784
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,560
that the world of cinema
revolves around them.

785
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,680
- What's wrong in that?

786
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,240
But then you should remember,

787
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,360
this one thing.

788
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,640
Only from a good story,

789
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,880
a good director, actor or
cameraman will be born.

790
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,720
The first craft of
cinema is a good story.

791
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,320
A good director or actor
is formed in cinema,

792
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,160
when they select good stories.

793
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,080
So, we shall start from tomorrow.

794
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,440
To identify the good artists within you;

795
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,000
a 30 days acting workshop.

796
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,160
Good luck!

797
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,640
Sigh! I didn't get a
chance to impress him!

798
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Sir,

799
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,800
you didn't ask our names.

800
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,040
I'm not going to remember the
names of these 16 people.

801
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,840
I will learn your names
based on your performances.

802
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,560
Sir,

803
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,760
if so, it'll be good if you remember
my name before the performance.

804
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,520
Okay. What's your name?

805
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,040
Aashiq Abu.

806
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,720
What happened?
Sir didn't like the name?

807
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,920
So you didn't say that
to mock Manoj sir?

808
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,880
So you don't know the matter?

809
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,720
Manoj sir would get furious even if
he hears director Aashiq Abu's name.

810
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:43,960
Why?

811
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,760
Manoj Sir's last 3 films released
along with Aashiq Abu's films.

812
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,400
And those 3 were huge flops!

813
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,640
He has that ego!

814
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,600
And you said that name
in between all this!

815
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,360
Anyway, he is upset.

816
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,680
- He's screwed, right?
I think so.

817
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,920
Even though I said so much,

818
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,080
I don't understand why
she gave me the job.

819
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,720
I'm not thinking about all that.

820
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,000
Who gave Aashiq Abu the
name 'Aashiq Abu'?

821
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,320
When I'm talking about important
things, you & your Aashiq Abu!

822
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,760
I am in a fix!

823
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,600
Why are you tensed?

824
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,920
If you say sorry, your problem
would be solved, right?

825
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,240
I hit him because he was being a pervert.

826
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,360
And I should apologize to him?

827
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,000
Are all these your big problems?

828
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,960
There are two ways to solve any problem.

829
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,960
Hello!

830
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,600
I don't want the tough way!

831
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,280
Tell me only if there's
an easy route.

832
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,640
Vijay,

833
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,200
Close your eyes,

834
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,520
and just say a sorry
without any honesty.

835
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,640
If that can solve the
problem, let it get solved!

836
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,720
And Sidhu,

837
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,080
You think about it.

838
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,680
Even after you said so much,
if she has offered you a job;

839
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,080
what would be her
intention behind that?

840
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,920
What would it be?

841
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,360
What would it be?

842
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,400
Is it?

843
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,600
That's all!

844
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,160
What about my problem?

845
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,400
What's your problem?
- Aashiq Abu.

846
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,760
So Aashiq Abu is your problem.

847
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,439
Dude, you said your name was Aashiq
Abu to impress that director, right?

848
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:20,999
Even if he forgets everyone
else, he would remember you.

849
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,800
Just show him a good performance;

850
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,560
his attitude would change.

851
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,520
How is it?

852
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,600
Very beautiful.

853
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:38,960
So good, right?

854
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,239
Let her feel the fragrance!

855
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:58,279
Nice!

856
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,280
It's not an issue.

857
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:07,239
May I come in?

858
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,160
Ya. That's what I said.

859
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,399
I think so.

860
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,720
So nice!

861
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,160
I'll call you later.
Okay?

862
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,680
So, Mr. Siddharth Gopan;

863
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,280
Welcome to Blue Seven
Star Group of Companies.

864
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,520
So shall we start?

865
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,560
Should we start right now?

866
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,640
It needs a right time
and place, right?

867
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,640
Shall we start?
- Ya okay.

868
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,080
Arun, this is our new staff.

869
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,040
And this is Arun.
Our senior executive.

870
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,320
So show Siddharth to his cabin.

871
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,000
And you've kept those pending
files on the table, right?

872
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,040
Yes.

873
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,360
Siddharth will handle
all that from now on.

874
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,520
If you need anything, just tell Arun.

875
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,440
And today is your first day, right?

876
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,120
So don't do too much work.

877
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,760
I've kept some files on your table.

878
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,120
Just cross-check them.

879
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,480
I think there has been
a mistake somewhere.

880
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,960
So, rectify it and I think..

881
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,680
You can keep it on my
table before 5 PM.

882
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,360
That's it?

883
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,160
Anything else?

884
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,120
You just have to do
that today, Siddharth.

885
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,600
Hi. I'm Siddharth.
You can call me Sid.

886
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,920
I know.
Madam told me.

887
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,480
This is your cabin.

888
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,120
Siddharth, cabin!

889
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,000
Siddharth, right?
I know!

890
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,840
Okay?

891
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,040
Arun,

892
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,720
Shivani..
I mean..

893
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,160
If you could give me the files that your
madam was talking about, I could check them!

894
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,200
Files, right?

895
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,160
They will come now.
- Okay. Make it fast!

896
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,640
Happy, right?

897
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:16,760
I have to check all this before 5 PM,
and find a mistake in this, right?

898
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,320
I just thought about
you, brother.

899
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
What is it?

900
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,680
You're happy there, right?

901
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,920
I don't know how to thank you.

902
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,560
Okay!
Work properly!

903
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,080
Okay.

904
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,120
Start!

905
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,480
What's your problem?

906
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,360
(A scene from 'My Boss' plays on TV)

907
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,160
- This is the guy who sees
ladies without clothes, right?

908
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,080
- Ya! Come! Let's mess with him.

909
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,920
What do you want?

910
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:35,960
What?

911
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,160
I just need a tea.

912
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,120
'Without'

913
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,320
What happened, dude?

914
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,120
'All of us were fed up'

915
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,280
'Even though we came
escaping from problems,

916
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:32,200
we learned that running away is
not a solution for any problem'

917
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,840
'In every story,

918
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,600
there will be a twist'

919
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,720
'We were waiting for such a twist'

920
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,960
'That came looking for us'

921
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,680
Now you would have an idea about acting.

922
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,400
But, more than that;

923
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,640
there's something that
an actor needs first.

924
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:10,080
Do any of you know what that is?

925
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,840
Sir!

926
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,720
Tell me!

927
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:14,920
Advance!

928
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,360
Anyone else?

929
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,240
Sir.

930
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,880
Next blunder?

931
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,080
Sir,

932
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,720
Tell me, Aashiq Abu.

933
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,400
An actor should be a good reader.

934
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,480
It's not that!

935
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,160
I know so many actors who
cannot read & write!

936
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,680
Anyone else?

937
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,320
Learning makes a person knowledgeable.

938
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,200
But,

939
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:06,120
a person attains wisdom;

940
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,920
through his observation skills.

941
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,000
And that's what you
should be achieving next.

942
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,960
Only when you observe everything
around you in detail;

943
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:22,640
an actor can transform
fully into any character.

944
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,160
In the coming 7 days,

945
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,960
that's what you should be doing.

946
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,080
Choose a person from
your surroundings,

947
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:34,360
understand their behaviour and activities;

948
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:35,960
And then,

949
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
come here and
explain about them.

950
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,880
- School is over for today.

951
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,360
Aashiq, wait!

952
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:48,360
Do you understand anything that I say here?
- Yes Sir.

953
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,160
Leave all that.

954
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,880
Whom are you going to observe?

955
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,000
A room-mate of mine.

956
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,040
No need of all that!

957
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,360
I will tell you whom
you should observe.

958
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,120
I have arranged the meeting.

959
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,480
You just have to say a 'sorry'.

960
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,080
So, let's proceed.

961
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,720
All of you know, right?

962
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:47,120
If this problem reaches the court, it
will be troublesome for both parties.

963
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,240
Not just that,

964
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,680
since it is an issue
between 2 staff members,

965
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,440
you should think about the
company's reputation as well.

966
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,200
My client is not interested
in taking this to court.

967
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,840
It will be solved if
Mr. Vijay says a sorry.

968
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,520
Vijay!

969
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,480
I didn't do anything.

970
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,120
See how arrogant he is!

971
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,200
Is your company trying to
protect someone like him?

972
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,560
Now this case will go to the court.

973
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,240
Your career is finished!

974
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,280
It's the first time that a file
has gone missing from your cabin.

975
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,440
Who is over here, who holds
a grudge against you?

976
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,520
Where is that file, Siddharth?

977
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:14,960
File?

978
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,080
Not this!

979
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,400
I'm asking about the file which was
on my table yesterday until I left!

980
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,120
You are the only staff
working late-nights here.

981
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,800
You were here yesterday as well.

982
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,400
That file won't go anywhere
without your knowledge.

983
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,600
Madam, I don't know which
file you are talking about.

984
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,760
If you stay idle and ogle
at all the girls here,

985
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,240
you won't have any idea about
the file or the company!

986
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,400
And since this is a job you got through
your brother's recommendation,

987
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,600
I know that you won't have
any more responsibility.

988
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,880
You haven't come
here to work, right?

989
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,600
Madam, listen to me..
- I don't want to hear anything, Sid.

990
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,800
I just need that file.

991
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,800
Right now.

992
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,120
On my table.

993
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,280
Did she go?

994
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,320
You have been following me
for a couple of days now.

995
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,280
Shall I call the police?
- Oh God!

996
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,120
I'm not that kind of a person!

997
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,880
Then why are you following me?

998
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,680
Please don't ask me about that.

999
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,880
I cannot say that.

1000
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,720
You're doing all this because that
jobless director asked you, right?

1001
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,800
How did you understand that?

1002
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,160
Couldn't you find any
other better director?

1003
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,880
But.. How do you know that?

1004
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,280
He is my husband!

1005
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,400
Husband?

1006
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,680
I suspected him
because you said so.

1007
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,560
And it was me who forgot
the file at home.

1008
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,880
I just shared a suspicion of mine with you.

1009
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,400
But you shouted at him
a little too much!

1010
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,320
What do I tell him now?

1011
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,000
So what all have you
observed about me?

1012
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,840
Tell me, man!
Let me hear it.

1013
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,040
You really like shopping, madam!

1014
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,880
Especially modern dresses.

1015
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,360
And then?

1016
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,480
Then,

1017
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,440
you read a lot of English books.

1018
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,240
Especially, books on cooking.

1019
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,840
Chicken soup is your
favourite dish.

1020
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,160
Is that it?

1021
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,160
Ya.

1022
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,200
Your observations are all nonsense.

1023
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,440
Firstly, I don't like shopping.

1024
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,840
And from my dressing,
you think I am modern?

1025
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,360
And then what did you say?
Books!

1026
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,520
I don't read that much.

1027
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,760
What you saw that day was
not a book on cooking.

1028
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,960
I bought a book as a
gift for my friend.

1029
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:41,120
I haven't even made a good
tea in my life so far.

1030
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:46,280
You don't worry.
I'll tell you, what to tell him.

1031
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,880
You don't have to say
anything, madam.

1032
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,560
I understood what it is.

1033
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,040
See Siddharth,

1034
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,000
it was my mistake.

1035
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:00,280
I did all that based
on a misunderstanding.

1036
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,440
That file..

1037
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,520
I was the one who misplaced it.

1038
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:06,920
I'm so sorry.

1039
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,840
It's okay, madam.

1040
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,280
Anyway, I understood something.

1041
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,520
In this world,

1042
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,200
every young person who
doesn't have a job,

1043
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,920
would have thought just like me.

1044
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,720
But when you told that to
everyone and mocked me,

1045
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,560
you forgot something.

1046
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,560
If I said all that
during the interview,

1047
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,200
that was because of the sincerity
I showed to this company.

1048
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,160
My state of mind when I had to work
in the middle of all this mocking;

1049
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,440
will you be able to understand it?

1050
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,040
There he goes!

1051
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,720
What are you doing?

1052
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,280
Has he gone mad?

1053
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,320
Is that new?

1054
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,040
Didn't I tell you not
to call this idiot?

1055
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,560
How can we go without him?
Only he knows the place.

1056
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,600
You don't know?

1057
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:54,320
'So both of them started
enjoying their lives in Kochi'

1058
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,640
'But us who always
took the easy routes;

1059
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:03,680
we couldn't understand that it was just a
calm before a huge danger that was coming'

1060
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,040
A person whom I have observed a lot,

1061
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,800
and would like to continue observing;

1062
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,040
is Sumechi who stays next to my house.

1063
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,920
Sumechi wakes up daily at
6.30 AM in the morning.

1064
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,680
Then she goes to
take a bath first.

1065
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:22,040
She sometimes forgets to lock
the door of her bathroom.

1066
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,720
She takes bath using
a green Pears soap.

1067
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,520
And the most exciting part is that;
in those days;

1068
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,280
that is when her
husband is not around,

1069
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,040
Enough!
- Next part is the most interesting.

1070
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,080
Go & sit there.

1071
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,200
You should recognize good observations.
This is why your movies flopped.

1072
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,720
The person I observed,

1073
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,000
is someone who wants
to live a simple life;

1074
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:43,880
she wants her surroundings also to
be simple & in order, just like her.

1075
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,720
He'll be thrown out now.

1076
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,160
Her words have a lot of clarity.

1077
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,320
Things I couldn't
understand in 7 years;

1078
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,400
he understood all that
within just 7 days!

1079
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,560
He isn't an ordinary guy!

1080
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,200
Is this called observation?

1081
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,840
Observation is not understanding
a person's activities;

1082
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,160
instead,

1083
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:07,800
it is learning about the personality
of that person from his/her activities.

1084
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:12,480
Many of you talked only about
the activities of those people.

1085
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:16,840
But, Aashiq talked
about that personality!

1086
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,280
And Aashiq could do it,

1087
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,120
because there is a
good actor within him.

1088
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,920
Congratulations Aashiq.

1089
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:36,960
Good job, bro!

1090
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,160
You performed well.

1091
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,000
But there's no point!

1092
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,520
I don't think this lousy
Malayalam industry

1093
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,160
can afford me!

1094
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,000
So using some Mumbai
connections of mine,

1095
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,040
I'm going to Bollywood.

1096
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,760
So let's meet next when I am an actor!

1097
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,360
Okay?

1098
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,480
I'm leaving, brother.
(in Hindi)

1099
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,480
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.

1100
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,320
Sir, bill.

1101
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,240
Bill!

1102
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,360
I initially thought you had some
personal revenge against my son, Vijay.

1103
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,960
I had made up my mind
to destroy your career.

1104
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:30,880
That's when,

1105
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:34,200
he told me that he
disturbed your girlfriend.

1106
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,680
Since it's my son's mistake;

1107
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,520
I arranged such a meeting.

1108
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,800
Now,

1109
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,040
he should be apologizing to you.

1110
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,520
Sir, I'm really sorry.

1111
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,960
I was just carried away then..
- Hey! It's okay, Sanjay!

1112
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,880
We are not proceeding
with that case.

1113
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,800
You can re-join the company.

1114
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,360
I have informed the company.

1115
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,640
So,

1116
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,440
All the best!

1117
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,880
Shall I ask you something, Vijay?

1118
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,640
Aren't you their trainer?

1119
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,640
Trainer is like a teacher.

1120
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:11,840
Right?

1121
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,280
When your students go wayward,

1122
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,200
isn't it your responsibility to
bring them to the right path?

1123
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,200
When you go back there,

1124
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,920
I will expect a good teacher for sure.

1125
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:58,920
Chechi!

1126
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,000
It worked! Manoj Sir said that
he will give me a chance.

1127
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,440
Okay Vijay. So we'll be happy
to see you here on Monday.

1128
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,960
I'll be there, Sir.
Thank you.

1129
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,920
Dad wants to meet you.
- Really?

1130
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,520
Okay. I will come.

1131
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,840
It's my first time.
I'm so excited!

1132
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,840
- How is your father?

1133
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,840
As if all this is going to happen!

1134
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,200
So this is your observation?

1135
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,840
Let's go!

1136
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,200
Yes.

1137
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:06,200
I understood that you don't
have anything to tell me.

1138
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,160
You don't have to suffer trying
to avoid me when you see me.

1139
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:15,240
I won't disturb you anymore.

1140
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,240
You have changed a lot.

1141
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,320
You are not the Vijay I loved
or the Vijay who loved me.

1142
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,760
He..

1143
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,240
He is not in this world
anymore, like Sam.

1144
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,440
If you accept a project, you
should do it with sincerity.

1145
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,560
You shouldn't use
shortcuts instead.

1146
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,760
I told you in the first class itself;

1147
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,760
not to use shortcuts
for success!

1148
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,960
Don't enter my class again!

1149
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:04,960
Get out!

1150
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,920
Sir..
- Get out, I say!

1151
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,640
That devil asked me not
to go there anymore.

1152
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:15,240
I am also fed up!

1153
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:18,280
I don't have the talent
to become a good actor!

1154
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,120
But..

1155
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:24,440
How will I face the people in my town
when I go back? That's my problem!

1156
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:30,600
He left from here very
happily in the morning!

1157
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,160
What happened to you, Siddhu?

1158
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,080
I thought I'll stop everything
and start living properly.

1159
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:58,720
In her house,

1160
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
on her chair;

1161
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,280
with dreams about her;

1162
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,080
I was waiting for her dad.

1163
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,440
That's when I noticed that.

1164
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,640
I didn't stay there after that.

1165
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,280
You're laughing when
I've lost my life?

1166
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,000
Don't you have any
solution for this?

1167
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,560
Escaping from problems is
your usual routine, right?

1168
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,760
I already knew that this is
going to up end up like this.

1169
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,800
Don't you always say that there are two
ways to solve every problem, right?

1170
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,360
I was just kidding about it..

1171
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:39,760
Actually not.

1172
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,120
Then?

1173
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,120
There is only one way to
solve certain problems.

1174
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:49,200
The difficult way.

1175
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,000
I can choose any way to
get out of this fix.

1176
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,640
Tell me, please.
- For that,

1177
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,640
you should find out what
the actual problem is.

1178
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:56,680
Actual problem?

1179
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,640
Only if you find what the actual problem
is, you can find a solution for it!

1180
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,360
So what should we do for that?

1181
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,040
You should find that yourself.

1182
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,560
You should search for it.

1183
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:08,120
You should keep searching,

1184
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:09,840
and go on a journey
to search for it!

1185
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:11,040
A journey?

1186
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,680
Journey, searching
for the problems.

1187
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,040
- Dude, give me some.
- Why didn't you hurl abuses at him?

1188
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:21,760
Whom?

1189
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:23,560
That director fellow!

1190
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,160
- Are the stars gone?

1191
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,880
If a spineless fellow tries to be
an actor, this is what happens.

1192
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,320
Drive to that Manoj's house.

1193
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,400
What?
Huh?

1194
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,160
Drive to that Manoj's
house, I say!

1195
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:39,880
Okay.

1196
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:41,720
Okay. Go there.

1197
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,360
But I won't get out of the car.

1198
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,880
No Scobo! We four are going!

1199
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,760
Isn't that correct?
- Ya.

1200
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,600
Hey! Stop!

1201
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:54,160
Stop! This is the house!

1202
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:55,840
Stop!
- Ashiq, calm down!

1203
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,000
Dude, let me get down.

1204
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,760
We'll stop the car!
- Manoj, I have come!

1205
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,920
Don't create a scene when you're drunk.
Talk to him tomorrow.

1206
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,000
Hey!
- Stop, Ashiq!

1207
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,400
Hey Manoj!

1208
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,160
Hey! Open the gate!

1209
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,880
They must have locked the gate
knowing that he would be coming!

1210
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,240
Hey! Open the gate!
- Don't provoke him!

1211
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:15,120
You locked the gate because
you knew I was going to come?

1212
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:16,800
Dude, don't shout!
- He locked it, man!

1213
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,440
Jump over the gate, man!
- He locked it!

1214
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,800
Dude, we'll end up at the
police station in the night!

1215
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,360
Manojetta, see!

1216
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,000
I struggled a lot to
reach these heights!

1217
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,920
He's already drunk! Don't
make him drink more.

1218
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:30,960
Hey!
I...

1219
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,800
Hey Manoj Sir!

1220
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,000
Open it & look at me, man!

1221
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,120
Manoj, are you hiding?

1222
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,880
Look who's here!

1223
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,480
Sheesh! Is he the guy in shorts?

1224
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,280
Manoj Sir!

1225
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,680
That's Manoj Sir.
- Sir!

1226
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,120
You know something?

1227
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,840
You know what my name is?

1228
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:55,680
My name is Aashiq Abu itself!

1229
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,280
Why do you get pissed
when you hear that?

1230
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,320
This guy!
Manoj!

1231
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:07,200
Didn't you take money from me
saying that you'll teach me acting?

1232
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:08,240
Didn't you?

1233
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,920
And then he is saying,

1234
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,160
that no one can teach acting!

1235
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,440
Then why did you
take money from me?

1236
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,000
That's correct!
- You know where that money came from?

1237
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,760
You know the value
of that money?

1238
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:21,040
The people of my town,

1239
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:24,440
that money is the money they collected
with a lot of struggle & difficulty,

1240
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:28,280
to make me a big actor!

1241
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,880
It's their hope, man!
- Ashiq!

1242
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,400
Continue, dude!
- Enough! Come back!

1243
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,680
- Come back!
- Shut up!

1244
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,040
Dude, this..

1245
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:40,040
That name will only suit scoundrels
like you who take classes in AC rooms.

1246
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:42,400
Oops! Sorry!

1247
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,080
That was a Suresh
Gopi (actor) influence.

1248
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,520
Where did I stop?
- AC!

1249
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:49,480
You won't understand our sorrows,
sitting in your AC room.

1250
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,720
Do you know how I reached here?

1251
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,120
Ya right! As if that's his job!

1252
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,360
Dude, do you guys know?
- I don't know!

1253
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,000
- I know! Come back!
- I..

1254
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,800
Pattavayal..

1255
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,280
Just a minute.

1256
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,960
A village called Pattavayal.
- Sentiments!

1257
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,440
Good morning.

1258
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:53,440
Good morning.

1259
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:01,720
Ashiq,

1260
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,360
did you notice these fishes?

1261
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,320
Every time I throw this to them,

1262
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,960
only one fish is
getting it at a time.

1263
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,640
But, the other fishes
do not give up trying.

1264
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,880
They are all waiting for
the next opportunity.

1265
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,760
Our lives are also like that.

1266
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,160
Even if we don't get it in
spite of trying many times,

1267
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:26,600
don't give up trying.

1268
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,560
Wait for an opportunity.

1269
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:33,280
Victory will be achieved only
by a person who keeps trying.

1270
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,360
God has kept that aside for him.

1271
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:40,920
Scobo!

1272
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,560
Shall we go?

1273
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,280
Ya! Let's go!

1274
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:45,440
Come!

1275
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,080
'I ran,

1276
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,880
and kept on running;

1277
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,800
I ran across the lakes,
oceans and shores;

1278
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:58,240
I ran until I realized that
running away is not an answer'

1279
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,080
'I wasn't looking for answers'

1280
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,440
'Not for questions
or reasons either'

1281
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,160
'I was searching for myself'

1282
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,120
'And I searched
in the distances'

1283
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,000
'But nearby,

1284
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,400
right next to me;

1285
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,640
I myself, was the question and the answer'

1286
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,080
It's not others;

1287
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:29,840
we should find out about
our problems ourselves.

1288
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:33,360
They are hidden somewhere
within each of us.

1289
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,760
Where you find the
actual problem;

1290
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,320
that's where the answers begin!

1291
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:22,280
'Twists make the story
more interesting'

1292
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:27,200
'It was almost time for the climax twist'

1293
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:29,840
'The final twist'

1294
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,400
'Scobo was missing'

1295
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,600
'And then we began searching for Scobo'

1296
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,760
'We had decided that

1297
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,840
Scobo will give us solutions,

1298
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,640
to all our problems'

1299
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,880
'But instead of solutions,

1300
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:48,240
what he gave us was a
rendezvous with our problems'

1301
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,040
(A few years back)

1302
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:09,200
Hello!

1303
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,800
What's the problem?

1304
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:18,120
I noticed even while you
were in the office.

1305
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:19,840
You were really silent.

1306
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,120
It's not suiting you at all!

1307
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Sam!

1308
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:28,520
What is it, man?

1309
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:38,240
You won't speak?

1310
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:41,440
Hello?

1311
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,360
I did a big mistake.

1312
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,520
I don't know what to do.

1313
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:59,280
I bought my bike by taking
a loan with interest.

1314
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,680
When they said that they
would go to my house

1315
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:04,080
if I don't repay the money;

1316
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:06,160
It will be solved if you
repay the money, right?

1317
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,960
Is that why you are so tensed?

1318
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:09,400
I will give you the money.

1319
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:10,920
Go & pay it in the morning.

1320
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:12,400
It's not that.

1321
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:16,080
Since I didn't have any other
option to raise the money;

1322
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:17,480
I made a mistake.

1323
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:19,560
When I entered the floor today,

1324
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,000
I took a pen & paper,

1325
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,200
without anyone noticing.
- What?

1326
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,280
And?

1327
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,400
I wrote down the card
details of certain clients.

1328
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,360
I thought no one would find out,

1329
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,880
if I withdrew a dollar each
from each of their accounts.

1330
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:37,440
I thought I could repay
my debt with that..

1331
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:39,120
What the hell are
you talking about?

1332
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,600
And did you withdraw the money?
- No!

1333
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,760
But..

1334
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
But?

1335
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:46,960
When I left the office in a hurry,
I left the paper over there.

1336
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,440
It's still over there.

1337
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,680
What have you done, Sam?

1338
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,920
Do you have any idea
about the consequences,

1339
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,480
if someone sees
that paper there?

1340
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:59,320
You will get arrested!

1341
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,240
You will get arrested, Sam!

1342
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,280
Did you think about your family
before you made such a blunder?

1343
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:06,080
Did you think about us?

1344
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,800
Couldn't you at least
give me a clue about it?

1345
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,040
What's the point
in saying it now?

1346
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:22,680
Come!

1347
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,920
What do we do now?

1348
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,160
We will have to climb 9 floors!

1349
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,840
Come!

1350
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,000
Why did you have to
do such a blunder?

1351
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,080
Is it hidden?

1352
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,600
Come!

1353
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:53,680
Come fast!

1354
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:55,720
It's on your table, right?

1355
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:58,080
Take it fast!

1356
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:00,800
Take it!

1357
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:04,400
Come!

1358
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,520
'I didn't tell anyone

1359
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:13,440
what actually happened'

1360
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,120
'If I say that,

1361
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:18,120
this whole world would
consider him as a thief'

1362
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:21,720
'To find out the reason
behind his son's death;

1363
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:25,160
his father still keeps going
to the police station'

1364
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:28,320
'I am responsible for all that'

1365
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,680
'I can't forgive myself'

1366
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,160
'Problem'

1367
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:44,160
'The actual problem;

1368
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,160
somehow we were realizing it'

1369
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:53,040
'But that was not something
which haunted us then'

1370
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:54,680
'Scobo Jones'

1371
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
'Who is he?'

1372
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:57,320
'Where is he now?'

1373
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:01,960
'So we got back home, looking for Scobo'
- A police Jeep?

1374
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:04,440
Why are they here?

1375
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,040
Is there a problem?

1376
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:08,960
That director would've complained.

1377
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:16,320
Who are you?
- We stay on rent in this house.

1378
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,400
On rent?

1379
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,960
When did I give my
house on rent to you?

1380
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
How can you say claim
that this is your house?

1381
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,400
You said that this house
was on rent, right?

1382
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,160
So there would be an
agreement, right?

1383
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:27,360
There was no agreement, Sir.

1384
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:30,840
Or the account number you
transferred the rent to, bills;

1385
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,200
do you have anything like that?

1386
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:33,960
Sir, there was no rent!

1387
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:36,320
Scobo gave this house
to us absolutely free!

1388
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:39,520
We were very dear to Scobo!

1389
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,640
Is it?

1390
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:43,120
Let's talk about the rest at
the station then. - Okay!

1391
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,800
I think..

1392
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:49,600
I think that this is
not Scobo's house.

1393
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:59,200
'It was a house which was
entrusted to a security guard,

1394
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:01,680
by some NRI before leaving India'

1395
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,720
'The police questioned us'

1396
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,200
'Strongly'

1397
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:07,880
'They didn't believe the
story we told them'

1398
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,800
'Even we couldn't believe anything
at that point about that house

1399
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,720
which didn't have rent,
agreement or a deposit'

1400
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:19,640
'The police's investigation turned to the
person who was the security of that house'

1401
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:22,680
'When the police understood
that there was no such person,

1402
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,440
and that his address was fake;

1403
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,600
they stopped troubling us'

1404
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:30,000
'Finally they decided
to let us go on bail'

1405
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:34,240
'But Scobo Jones remained in
our minds as a big question'

1406
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:27,120
Hey! Are you planning to
stay here permanently?

1407
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:29,480
Call someone close to you
get yourself out on bail.

1408
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:45,920
Do you remember what
all you called me?

1409
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,360
Do you know what's
required to be an actor?

1410
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:50,600
Determination!

1411
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,880
A strong decision that you
should become something in life.

1412
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:58,560
Instead, you shouldn't give up on your
dreams; just because I shouted at you!

1413
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:01,080
Cinema doesn't need you.

1414
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,760
You are the one
who needs cinema!

1415
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:05,960
Have you ever done a
good performance here?

1416
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:09,360
Let bygones be bygones.

1417
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,480
Tomorrow is the last day
of the coaching class.

1418
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,920
If you think that there
is an actor within you,

1419
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:18,120
if you still believe so,

1420
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,720
you should prove that tomorrow,

1421
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:22,360
before the judges.

1422
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:23,680
You can do that!

1423
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,640
Whatever you have to say,
say that at least now.

1424
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:45,720
Even though he died,

1425
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:46,880
I have never cried.

1426
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,000
I always thought he was a fool.

1427
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:53,280
But for the first time, I feel
proud thinking about him today.

1428
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:55,800
He knows how to make good friends.

1429
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,360
And Vijay,

1430
01:55:58,360 --> 01:55:59,560
you are a good friend.

1431
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:01,240
You don't have to feel guilty.

1432
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:30,480
I feel like I have
seen you somewhere.

1433
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:32,520
I'm trapped!

1434
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,560
Aren't you the one who
came to the clinic and..

1435
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,240
You see everyone differently..
- We came to talk about his marriage.

1436
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:42,960
That's not at all a
hindrance to get married.

1437
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,720
Compared to what all I did in his age,

1438
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:48,480
this is nothing!
- Dad!

1439
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:51,320
Dear..
- This is Siddharth, whom I told you about.

1440
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:05,960
Indu,

1441
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:07,200
everything's gone!

1442
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:08,640
Hey,

1443
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:11,240
move from there and
come stand next to me.

1444
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:49,480
Cinema doesn't need you!

1445
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:51,000
You are the one
who needs cinema!

1446
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:54,200
Have you ever done a
good performance here?

1447
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,800
Even if you don't get it
after trying several times,

1448
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:59,240
don't give up trying!

1449
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:01,200
Wait for an opportunity.

1450
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:05,760
Victory will be achieved only
by the one who keeps trying!

1451
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,080
At CCM College,

1452
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:02,880
there's an acting
workshop for 30 days.

1453
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:08,360
That's our passport and Visa to cinema.

1454
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:11,800
What's your name?

1455
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:19,320
Manoj sir gets furious even if he
hears director Aashiq Abu's name.

1456
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:27,160
I will tell you whom
you should observe.

1457
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,880
Your observations are all wrong!

1458
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,320
The person I observed,

1459
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:43,560
wants to lead a simple life;

1460
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:49,800
and wishes that her surroundings
also has to be simple & in order.

1461
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:52,720
If you accept a project, you
should do it with sincerity.

1462
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,680
And you shouldn't use
shortcuts instead!

1463
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:57,480
That devil asked me not
to go there anymore.

1464
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:01,640
Then why did you take money from me?

1465
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:03,160
You know what my name is?

1466
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:06,200
My name is Aashiq Abu itself!

1467
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:11,960
Ashiq, did you
notice these fishes?

1468
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:18,840
We should find out what our
problems are, ourselves.

1469
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:22,800
That is hidden somewhere within us.

1470
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:28,200
Where you find out what
the actual problem is;

1471
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,040
that's where the answers begin!

1472
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:08,000
'So finally our story had a happy ending'

1473
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,480
'The answer to the final twist;

1474
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,080
we never got that'

1475
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:14,480
'Why did he do all that?'

1476
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,120
'Who is this Scobo Jones?'

1477
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:19,520
'This journey was to find that'

1478
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,280
1,2,3...

1479
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:23,080
Which is the place with 3 hills?

1480
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:24,520
Is it Moovattupuzha?

1481
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,040
Or is it Arattupuzha?
- Shut up, you idiot!

1482
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:30,480
We will do all the thinking!
You & your Moovattupuzha!

1483
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:33,400
Dude, isn't this your old friend?

1484
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,480
He is the actual actor!
Learn from him!

1485
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,320
Determination!
He got into Bollywood just like he said!

1486
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:44,360
A place with three hills & three rivers.

1487
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,400
Munnar!

1488
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:46,640
I thought about it earlier!

1489
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:48,440
But I didn't say it because
it was too simple.

1490
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,880
No rent, no agreement, no deposit.

1491
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:47,080
Isn't this the place?

1492
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Yes!

1493
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,040
Didn't I tell you?

1494
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:54,040
I'm so relieved!
We got a place!

1495
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:57,040
We have to cross these rivers & hills.
That's the problem!

1496
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:58,040
That's good.

1497
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:03,520
Come!

1498
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:05,200
There will be AC's, right?

1499
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:06,440
It's cold outside anyway!

1500
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:08,120
What are your names?

1501
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:10,200
Hello!
I'm Sunny from Wayanad.

1502
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:12,560
I'm Sanju from Alappuzha.

1503
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
And you?

1504
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:18,160
Shine, from Thrisshur.
- Nice grandpa!

1505
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:20,040
And a very nice house.
I liked it.

1506
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:22,000
Do young kids now wear 'mundu'?

1507
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:24,600
I have always worn this.
- Yes! It's him!

1508
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,920
Dude, come here!

1509
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:28,400
It's him!

1510
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:31,800
He thought we won't recognize him
if he grows his hair & beard! See!

1511
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,640
Dude, it's him!

1512
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,080
I'm sure!
It's him!

1513
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:36,280
Vijay, come!

1514
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,800
Dude, he has started his next game!

1515
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:40,560
There are new kids with him.

1516
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,760
This guy!
- Come!

1517
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:44,240
Dude, start the car!
Let's go!

1518
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:46,000
Sidhu, come!
- After starting the car?

1519
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:47,800
Let's go catch him!

1520
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,600
What will we do after catching him?
- We'll catch him and

1521
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:51,920
hand him over to the police!

1522
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:53,520
After handing him
over to the police?

1523
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:56,360
Then why did I come here
after adjusting my dates?

1524
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:57,880
Shouldn't we do
something to him?

1525
02:04:58,160 --> 02:05:00,200
Actually, what did he do to us?

1526
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:02,080
What did he do to us?

1527
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:03,360
He...

1528
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:06,080
We had to go to the police
station because of him, right?

1529
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:08,520
If we hadn't gone to the
police station then,

1530
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:10,920
we wouldn't have become
anything in life!

1531
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:16,000
Did he take us on a trip to find
solutions to problems in our life?

1532
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:17,120
I don't know!

1533
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:21,520
And then, he taught that us that we
should solve our problems ourselves.

1534
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,720
And where did we solve it?

1535
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:26,880
At the police station!

1536
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:29,760
If we think in that way,
wasn't he helping us?

1537
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:32,680
What do we do now?

1538
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:34,800
We don't have to do anything now.

1539
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,040
Like we got hold
of our lives back,

1540
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:39,600
let him be a turning point in
the lives of those 3 guys!

1541
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:43,160
To do social service,
you don't have to join the army!

1542
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,520
Scobo has his own methods for that!

1543
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:47,400
You get into the car for now!

1544
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:48,440
Huh?

1545
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:49,920
Well..

1546
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:51,040
Aren't we..

1547
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,520
Aren't we meeting him then?

1548
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,800
Then why did we come till here?
- You come, dude.

1549
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:57,080
Get into the car!

1550
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:59,240
I'll tell you everything
else in detail.

1551
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:02,800
My dates for 3 days are
blocked over there!

1552
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,680
You know how many
people are calling me?

1553
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:07,600
Do these people who're calling know
what my problem is & where I am?

1554
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:09,520
Why are you upset about that?
Drive, man!

1555
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:12,560
(muffled voices of Ashiq & Sid fighting)

1556
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,120
Shivani is waiting for me.
Drive fast!

1557
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:18,120
(muffled voices continue)

1558
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:21,600
Stop it, please!

1559
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:25,880
No! I want to go home right now!

1560
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:46,560
So these are your problems?

1561
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:51,040
There are two ways to
solve every problem.

1562
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:53,400
One is a difficult way,

1563
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:55,240
and the other is an easy way.

1564
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,760
You won't choose the
first way, right?

1565
02:06:58,720 --> 02:06:58,720
I'll tell you the easy way!
