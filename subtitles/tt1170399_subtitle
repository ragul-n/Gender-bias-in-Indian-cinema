00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:38,727
Okay! So, are you all ready
with your popcorn?

2
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,465
Switch off your cell! And listen..

3
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,468
Here is the story!

4
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,998
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

5
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:55,013
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

6
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,686
"One building.
- "With three prisoners."

7
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,020
"Everybody has their own."
- "Team."

8
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,686
"Everybody is in."
- "Their own world."

9
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,355
"Everybody has their own."

10
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,364
"Everybody's vision is the same."

11
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:15,366
"They want to fulfil their dream."

12
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:16,492
"Where is the money?"

13
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,300
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

14
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:25,305
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

15
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,719
"Move ahead and make money."

16
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,385
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

17
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,052
"He is Akshay Kumar."

18
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,794
"He is ailing from love."

19
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:51,336
"He fell in love
with a don's sister."

20
00:02:58,811 --> 00:02:59,869
"Money! Money!"

21
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,072
"Money! Money!"

22
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,405
"He is Akshay Kumar."

23
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:05,677

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,424
"Everybody's vision is the same."

26
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,426
"They want to fulfil their dream."

27
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:16,552
"Where is the money?"

28
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,360
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

29
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:25,365
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

30
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,440
"He is Mr. Jha."

31
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,771
"He is fed up of his own self."

32
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:40,781
"He is Mr. Jha."

33
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,385
"He is fed up of his own self."

34
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,782
"He is short."

35
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,918
"Whereas he wanted to
touch the sky."

36
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,122
"Everybody's vision is the same."

37
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,461
"They want to fulfil their dream."

38
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:54,590

00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,727
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

40
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,731
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

41
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,476
"What makes the world
go round and round?"

42
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,945
"Dollar, euro, pound."

43
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,483
"Move ahead and make money."

44
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,814
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

45
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,820
"He is Mr. Joshi."

46
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,152
"His son is the culprit."

47
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:23,486
"l think someday he will
break his silence."

48
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:26,087
"You better break it.
You got to shake it."

49
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,690
"You got to break those rules
and make your dreams."

50
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,759
"He is Mr. Joshi."

51
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,168
"His son is the culprit."

52
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:38,910
"l think someday he will
break his silence."

53
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,105
"Everybody's vision is the same."

54
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,239
"They want to fulfil their dream."

55
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,510
"Where is the money?"

56
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,984
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

57
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:52,851
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

58
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,794
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

59
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,799
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

60
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,530
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

61
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,546
Greetings.

62
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,549
Hello! Hello! Greetings!

63
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:31,619
Good evening and welcome to
Karan Banaye Crorepati!

64
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:36,225
In this show, l, Karan Johar
will ask just 20 questions.

65
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,237
And you will take home 1 crore.

66
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,236
Victory and loss is
what makes our show.

67
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,709
At times joy, at times
sorrow, you know.

68
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:50,243
So let's watch today what magic
the first contestant will show.

69
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,580
Let's see if he lives up
to his name..

70
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,915
..and gives us some rocking
action tonight.

71
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:58,714
Let me tell you, you will be
stunned to hear his name.

72
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,658
Please welcome from Mumbai,
the one and only..

73
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,718
..none other than Akshay Kumar.

74
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,054
Akshay Kumar! Really?

75
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:14,795
He is Akshay Kumar?

76
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:17,067
Hello! Hello!

77
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,201
Hello!
- Hi!

78
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,801
Welcome to Karan Banaye Crorepati!

79
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,278
Please come! -Very nice
to see you, sir!

80
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,746
Come on! Good to see you too!

81
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,874
I welcome you to the hot seat.
- Thank you, sir.

82
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,274
Okay!

83
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,812
I had never thought that I will get
a chance to sit in your company!

84
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,880
No, no, no!

85
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,627
You are my favourite director, sir!
- Thank you!

86
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:37,286
I watched Kabhi Alvida
Naa Kehna twice.

87
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,561
And I must compliment
you on your good taste.

88
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,301
So Mr. Player, shall we begin
the game? - Absolutely!

89
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,631
Fantastic!

90
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:48,230
First question for 1000 rupees
on your computer screen!

91
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,702
Who is the Father of lndia!

92
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:54,575
Gandhi! Mahatma Gandhi!

93
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,109
Sir, you can lock it!
- No!

94
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,240
Lock it!

95
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,114
Of course, I can lock it.
But let me finish the question.

96
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,175
Yes!

97
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,178
Who is the Father of lndia!
We all know that!

98
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:10,261
But what was the name of his cook
at Sabarmati Ashram (hermitage).

99
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,923
Your four options on
your computer screen.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,936
A. Hitenbhai Shah. B.
Praveenbhai Patel.

101
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:23,674
C. Chowfa. D. None of the above.

102
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:24,731
Meaning none from the
above mentioned names.

103
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,753
Sir, this question is
for 1000 rupees?

104
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,016
Yes. Why?

105
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:43,626
No, I thought you have asked the
last question first by mistake.

106
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,688
You have a nice sense of humour.

107
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,633
But this is the question.

108
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,637
Sir, I would want to use
the lifeline.

109
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,164
I knew it. Sure.

110
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,383
Excuse me!
Akshay, if you don't mind.

111
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,725
For the past one hour, you are
stuck at the first question.

112
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,661
You have used all the lifelines too.

113
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,125
For God's sake please
lock an option. Please.

114
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,337
A. Hitenbhai Shah. D.
None of the above.

115
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,395
I beg of you!

116
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:33,742
Fine. A. Hitenbhai Shah.

117
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:35,143
Thank God!

118
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,275
Computer, quickly lock
A. Hitenbhai Shah.

119
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:51,294
Wrong answer!

120
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:54,230
The right answer is D.
None of the above.

121
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,165
Akshay, you should have known.

122
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,430
Gandhi used to do all
his chores on his own.

123
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,035
Even in my dream
I can't earn money.

124
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,836
'My name is of an action hero.'

125
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,773
'But I am a reaction hero.'

126
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:13,909
Idiot!

127
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:15,845
'l had an attraction
to the underworld..

128
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:16,979
..since the time I was born.'

129
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,114
Maya!

130
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,384
'As such I am a coward.'

131
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,790
'But since college days
my passion has been..

132
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,388
..to sit in goons' company and
to collect news about them.'

133
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,127
'Today too that passion
is in fashion.'

134
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,930
'But as my job.'

135
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,797
'Such a job where whether your
personality is strong or not..

136
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:37,467
..your voice should be strong.'

137
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:41,809
And like this encounter
specialist Chawla..

138
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,007
..shot Chikna Ayub on the street..

139
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,814
And it was possible because
of alert citizens like you.

140
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:49,877
And remember, together we can..

141
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:52,355
..and we will make a difference!

142
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:56,827
That's why I say if you want to
sleep peacefully then wake up!

143
00:09:56,895 --> 00:10:00,353
I am Akshay Kumar and you
are watching 'Khalbali!'

144
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:01,421
Cut it! Okay!

145
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,962
Ravi, come with me.
I want to talk to you urgently!

146
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,095
Yes, come.

147
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:08,298
Did you make arrangement
for my money?

148
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,898
It's difficult. The amount is big.

149
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,908
The other party is asking
for guarantee.

150
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,040
But you need so much money..

151
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,049
Ravi, it's personal.
- Cool!

152
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,847
Underworld gave me not just
a job, but a girl too.

153
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,983
"You are my passion."

154
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:33,258
"You are the awakened
desire of my heart."

155
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:38,801
"Now I don't want to live
without you, darling."

156
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,808
"Now I don't want to live
without you, darling."

157
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,477
If you want to sleep peacefully
then.. wake up.

158
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:51,872
Hi, babes.

159
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,552
I have got all the details of Dubai!

160
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,479
Of Dubai?
- Yes!

161
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,880
You only said that brother's
relationship..

162
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:00,948
..with Dubai's gangsters is not good.

163
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:04,359
So I have decided that we
will elope and go to Dubai.

164
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,227
Did you arrange for the money?

165
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,287
Don't worry, babes.

166
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,833
It's almost done.
I will get the money soon.

167
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,899
What are you saying?

168
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,438
It means, within a week
we will be in Dubai!

169
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,435
You know how long I have been
waiting for this, Akki.

170
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,843
Finally that day has arrived.

171
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,910
From the underworld I am
coming to the real world.

172
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,846
And it's all because
of you! I love you!

173
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,316
'So you see, this is my story.'

174
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:34,322
'This crime reporter fell in
love with a don's sister.'

175
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,924
'That's why, today,
I need money desperately.'

176
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,456
'Who doesn't need it?
My friend too needs it.'

177
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,993
'l call him.. the dude!'

178
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,335
I am Ramakant Joshi.

179
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,938
Brother Prakash,
again the same man!

180
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,539
Let it be! That old man
is mad! Let it be!

181
00:11:58,617 --> 00:11:59,606
Tell me!

182
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,410
What was the cost of
Huggies in 1970?

183
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:07,619
In 1970, the price of a diaper
was 60 paisa! 60 paisa!

184
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,218
Write it! And please
don't call me again!

185
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,422
In 1978..

186
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,900
What was the cost of a fourth
standard book? Right?

187
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:20,300
3 rupees 40 paisa.
3.40! Write it!

188
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,896
And stop calling me
and harassing me!

189
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,972
Hello!

190
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:27,636
I am Ramakant Joshi.

191
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,972
In 1998, what was the cost
of a wedding horse?

192
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:33,313
It was 3000! 3000!

193
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,910
The hay included?
- Yes!

194
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,988
'With this, the retired accounted
Mr. Ramakant Joshi..

195
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:45,928
..alias dude, closed the biggest
account of his life.'

196
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:54,004
But what account have
you written in detail?

197
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:55,061
Look, Shewde!

198
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,009
This file contains all the
account of the money..

199
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:00,010
..which I have spent on my son..

200
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,013
..since the time he was born
till the time of his wedding.

201
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,275
And? -And..

202
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,414
I want to recover all
this money from my son.

203
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,956
From your son? From your own son?

204
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,958
You don't know that ungrateful
boy, Mr. Shewde!

205
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,953
My son Purshottam is
like TV's daily soap.

206
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,961
Every day's guarantee
of sorrow and pain.

207
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,963
Son killed his father for wealth.

208
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,565
Hello!

209
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,573
Papa!
- Yes!

210
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:37,979
Papa! I was wondering..
- Yes!

211
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,180
You are free.

212
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,989
So why don't you help me
with my site.

213
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,988
Manpower is less. You will be
able to use your time better.

214
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:54,996
And I too will receive your advice.

215
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,396
There should be somebody to point
out the employer's flaw.

216
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:04,398
So l.. - Listen!
Joglekar's call from the site.

217
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,068
He is saying the watchman
has not come.

218
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:08,271
I know! Tell him I know!
- Okay!

219
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,678
That's why I am trying
to convince papa..

220
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,751
Hello! He will call you back!

221
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,017
I made him a civil engineer.

222
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,285
Today he is constructing
his own building.

223
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,088
But he has no respect
for his father.

224
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,097
I didn't get his mother's treatment
done in a private hospital..

225
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:28,689
..so that there is no problem
in my son's studies.

226
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,292
Now when son has started earning..

227
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,700
..his father has become
a burden for him!

228
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,432
Look, Mr. Joshi. I can understand
your feelings.

229
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:38,237
But I am sorry. We can't fight
any case on this basis.

230
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,709
Because there is no law..

231
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:40,767
Why is there no such law?

232
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,111
When after a father's death,
a son can claim his father's wealth..

233
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:47,242
..then why can't a father have
a right on a son's earnings?

234
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,718
I have been an accountant
for 35 years, Shewde!

235
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,777
For 35 years!

236
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:55,125
No matter what, I will recover
my credit from..

237
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:57,388
..Purshottam Joshi before I die!

238
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:58,588
And that too with the interest!

239
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,530
The case is not strong. Give bribe..

240
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,730
Accountant!

241
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,204
Pradhan!

242
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:10,400
Today too you are talking
to yourself.

243
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:11,533
How are you?

244
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,205
I have only one problem in life.
That shanty problem.

245
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:19,749
Someday we will sit and talk
about the development.

246
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:20,876
Okay.

247
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:25,083
And we will have some tea too.

248
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,086
Why tea? Did you stop drinking?

249
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:29,482
For a few days.

250
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,756
You and here?

251
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,824
It means Purshottam's account
has been cleared.

252
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:40,295
But lawyer says that
we can't file a case.

253
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:46,634
Lawyers are liars! You don't worry.
We will do something.

254
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:47,770
Come! Come!

255
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,780
'Dude's problem was with his son.'

256
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:53,307
'But Lambodhar's problem
was with his life.'

257
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,852
It feels as if she comes
to drop two children!

258
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,184
What did you say?

259
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,398
Stop! Stop! Don't create a scene!

260
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,526
Everybody is looking!

261
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:15,139
Mummy, I told you! Don't
bring papa along! Give!

262
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,597
Ayush!

263
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:19,469
Are you mad?
- Stop! Stop!

264
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,142
Before venting your anger on others,
look at yourself!

265
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,670
This is bound to happen!

266
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,678
Nowadays, even Ayush
is ashamed of you!

267
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,476
What..

268
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:28,678
Show your anger to somebody else!

269
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,552
Be grateful that I have still not
told Ayush what work you do!

270
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,215
The day he finds out, he will lose..

271
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,815
..the little bit respect
that he has for you!

272
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,427
'So this is Lambodhar Jha's
small family. Sad family.'

273
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,232
'God made him short.'

274
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:47,237
'And Lambodhar's dream
of touching the sky..

275
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,897
..remained a dream.'

276
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,569
'No matter what people say.
But size matters.'

277
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,308
Hello!

278
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,186
You! Is everything fine?

279
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:10,650
How are you?

280
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:13,722
What did you say?

281
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,599
No. Nothing. I see you standing
in the queue everyday.

282
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,727
So I greeted you.

283
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,862
So many people stand in the queue.

284
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,337
Why didn't you smile at
them and greet them?

285
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:22,930
No.. -Fool!
- What are you doing?

286
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,211
'His frustration of being short
made Lambodhar too aggressive.'

287
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,681
'He would go really mad
on seeing tall people.'

288
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,808
'But Lambodhar's fight was
not just with tall people..

289
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:38,286
..it was with his fate too.'

290
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:39,880
Look, Mr. Jha.
- Yes.

291
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,687
I studied your horoscope.
- Yes.

292
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,227
Rest is fine.

293
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:48,491
But if you want to change your life..
- Yes.

294
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,298
Then you will have to join the
alphabet T with your surname.

295
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,497
Okay! T after Jha!
- Yes!

296
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,233
Jhat Bhatta!
- Yes!

297
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,506
"My heart wants."

298
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,239
"These lovely days should never pass."

299
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:10,718
"My heart wants."

300
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,448
"l should never part
from my friends."

301
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:22,392
"Everyday we should talk
about nice things."

302
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:27,266
"Dusks should sway and
nights should sing."

303
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,398
"Merriment.."

304
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:32,739
'We all three used a common
stair to progress in life.'

305
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,607
'Art of living class.'

306
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,412
'We learnt how to live life here.'

307
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,343
'Our art of living class means..

308
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:43,353
..a liquor bottle and three glasses.'

309
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:46,623
'What can be a better way
to live life than this?'

310
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,959
Here. At times, do wash your hands.

311
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,360
Didn't your parents teach you this?

312
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,488
They did teach me!

313
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,829
Lambodhar, you shouldn't
pee on your hand!

314
00:18:55,901 --> 00:19:00,031
Full pack, dude! Full pack!

315
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,902
He didn't wash his hands!

316
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:03,702
Don't touch! Don't touch!

317
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,906
He said you should join the
letter T with your surname!

318
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:13,314
What! T letter after Jha!

319
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:17,510
Letter T after Jha!

320
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,388
So Lambodhar, if your name
has been finalised..

321
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,325
..then shall we address
you by your new name?

322
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,727
No, it was a joke.

323
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,392
Its said what can you
do when your luck is..

324
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:30,995
Bad! Bad!

325
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:35,734
I will have to defame myself
to change my luck!

326
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,409
Gayatri too always
threatens me that..

327
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:41,468
..she will tell my son
about the work I do.

328
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,808
By marrying this woman..

329
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,544
Akki, you don't repeat this mistake.

330
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,416
Find such a woman who loves
you, looks after you..

331
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,687
..and who earns for you.

332
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,085
Yes, dude.

333
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,422
I will have to keep in mind
that these three women..

334
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:03,023
..should not meet each other.

335
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:07,961
It was good!

336
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,439
If I get some money then
I will leave my job..

337
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:15,706
..and start some business.

338
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,116
My story too is the same!
I need my money.

339
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:23,920
The day I get money,
I will leave with Priya.

340
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:28,458
Dude, it's too hard!

341
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,919
This is hard?

342
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,054
Yes!

343
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,065
This is not hard! Do you
know what is really hard?

344
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,596
My son has offered me
a watchman's job!

345
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,730
This is hard! This is hard!

346
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:47,807
Dude, Purshottam is
acting too smart.

347
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,610
I have a fantastic idea!

348
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,549
Someday, we will teach him a lesson!

349
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,148
Why someday?
I will slap him tomorrow.

350
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,487
It has been a long time
since I slapped somebody.

351
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,083
Lambodhar, you will slap somebody!

352
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:06,490
I don't think your hand
will reach his face!

353
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,894
This was a good one!
It was good!

354
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,158
But seriously, dude.

355
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,571
We will have to do something
about this Purshottam.

356
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,108
Go and get that bottle!

357
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,441
This too was good! Good!

358
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,845
Crore! They are asking for a crore!

359
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,451
Do you understand?
1 crore!

360
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,885
Son, they must have dialled
the wrong number.

361
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:38,190
And maybe they were
asking for coco-cola.

362
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,198
It was a call from Dubai!

363
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,868
They have all the information
about us!

364
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:46,526
I am scared..

365
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,531
I have been living in this
middle class society..

366
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,543
..even after earning
loads of money..

367
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:55,545
..to escape from
the people's eyes.

368
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,211
Still I don't know
how they called me!

369
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,615
It's a crime to be a builder
in today's world!

370
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:01,674
Medicine!
- Yes.

371
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,122
You should go to the police.

372
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:10,491
Great! That miser Rasiklal
too made the same mistake!

373
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:14,027
Today Swarglok company's
owner is in heaven.

374
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,532
I want to live on earth
for some years.

375
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,096
I will have to arrange for 1 crore.

376
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,872
He said he will call again!

377
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,654
Hello!

378
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,631
Hey! I didn't call again
to greet you!

379
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,524
When will you give me the money?

380
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,602
Look, I am Purshottam's
father Ramakant Joshi.

381
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,667
Actually, Purshottam doesn't
have so much money.

382
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,010
What name did you say?
- Ramakant Joshi.

383
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,773
Did you live in lraniwadi?
- Yes. But how do you..

384
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:11,117
Uncle Joshi, I am Ghazal
Ul Rehman. Your Ghazlu!

385
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:12,745
Ghazlu!

386
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,281
Ghazlu!

387
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,955
Ghazlu! After so many years!

388
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,026
Yes! Do you remember me?

389
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,765
How can I forget you?

390
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,235
Since childhood, you were
a different child!

391
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:30,565
But.. I never thought you
will be such a big goon.

392
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:34,575
That too an NRl.
- Uncle, you too!

393
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,245
Forget all this! Tell me!

394
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,838
Do you still have
a penchant for music?

395
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,713
How can I forgo that, uncle?

396
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:43,049
Two days ago I had organised
Jagjit Singh's program at home.

397
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,179
What are you saying?

398
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:45,313
Then what!

399
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,654
For the first three songs,
I had to aim the gun on his head.

400
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:49,750
Gun!
- Then he got into the mood.

401
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:50,817
You have not changed at all!

402
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:54,197
So many times I have explained
not to take such risks.

403
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,997
How can I leave this job, uncle?

404
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,699
There is job satisfaction in this.

405
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,666
Job satisfaction!

406
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,738
But today, there was
a problem, uncle.

407
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,334
Why? What happened?

408
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,736
I called at your house.
Forgive your Ghazlu.

409
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:08,870
I made a mistake.

410
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,938
Why do you apologise?
I understand.

411
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,338
By the way, uncle..

412
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,084
If anybody is troubling
you, then tell me.

413
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:20,249
Trouble! Both of them are
troubling me! - Who?

414
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,623
Arthritis! And asthma!

415
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:30,231
Uncle, I am talking about goons.

416
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:32,064
No, we are not facing
any such problem.

417
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,339
Still, if there is any problem,
I will surely tell you.

418
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:37,772
Uncle, I will hang up now.
Greetings.

419
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:39,275
Okay, dear. God bless you!

420
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:48,317
Papa.. if not for you then
I would have lost 1 crore.

421
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,124
How can I let it happen?
It's my job to keep a watch.

422
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,656
After all.. I am a watchman.

423
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:07,796
I am telling you!

424
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:12,006
Purshottam's face was worth
watching. Kodak moment.

425
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:16,345
He said.. papa, now you won't
take permission to smoke!

426
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,917
Awesome, dude! Great!

427
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,743
You spoke in a strong voice.

428
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:24,816
Purshottam must have been
completely scared!

429
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:28,017
Yes! I didn't see him this scared
even on the nuptial night!

430
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:32,756
But uncle, your son is a
bigger coward than you.

431
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:38,427
I would have thought twice!
He was ready to give 1 crore.

432
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,765
He was ready?

433
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:40,895
Yes!

434
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,030
Why are you lying?

435
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:44,768
I am telling you the truth!
He said I won't go to the police.

436
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:46,139
You should have seen him talking!

437
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,700
Uncle, hang on!
- Yes!

438
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,440
He is willing to give 1 crore.

439
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,776
And he doesn't want
to go to the police?

440
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,837
Yes!

441
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:56,046
Uncle's file too shows 1 crore
on the account of Purshottam!

442
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,790
Why not.. why not..

443
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:00,846
Hello, brother!

444
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:04,793
The scene is getting loud.
We taught him a lesson!

445
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:07,057
You are happy with the
cigarette packet?

446
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,727
Now end this idea here!

447
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,300
You people are actually
thinking about extortion!

448
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:17,466
Not extortion! It's my
investment on my son!

449
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,942
So dude, accept that at times
you lose your investment too.

450
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:23,208
We have such a good chance
of earning money and you!

451
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,806
Look.. if I didn't get
married to Priya..

452
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:28,351
..then my life too will be
like yours.

453
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,145
I too need money.

454
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,222
But we are not criminals to
resort to extortion for that.

455
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,355
He is right! He is right!
He is right!

456
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,827
Instead of losing my respect,
its better to lose money.

457
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,831
And as it is,
I recovered my 1 crore..

458
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,428
..after seeing Purshottam's
scared face.

459
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,833
Dude, the name was mind-blowing,
wasn't it?

460
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:54,969
Ghazal Ul Rehman!

461
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,775
Mind-blowing! Mind-blowing!
From where did you find it?

462
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:59,115
Bangladesh cricketer's name!

463
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:01,413
What are you saying?
- As such his name is Fazal.

464
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,511
Really?
- But he changed it to Ghazal.

465
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:04,782
Great!

466
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,516
What happened then?

467
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,051
What else? Bhai (Don) was behind
bars for this matter. - Is that so?

468
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:17,801
In the prison, bhai had everything.
Fridge, microwave, TV.

469
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,937
And that TV changed bhai's life.

470
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:22,536
Bhai watched Aastha channel?

471
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,872
No! He watched Balaji's serials.

472
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,268
What are you saying?

473
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,336
Meaning Kahani and Kyunki serials
which my wife watches!

474
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,872
Yes! Bhai didn't have any
work for 4 years in prison.

475
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,815
It was just bhai and TV.

476
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:39,887
Since that day, bhai got hooked
to Balaji's serials.

477
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:42,425
He didn't miss the repeat
telecast too. - Is that so?

478
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,551
What?

479
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,493
The matter worsened after he
was released from the prison.

480
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,552
Is that so?

481
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:51,562
Yes! Dubai goons call film
stars and party. - Yes!

482
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:57,336
Similarly Dattubhai used to
call TV stars and party.

483
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,904
Bhai, TV stars come?

484
00:27:58,976 --> 00:28:01,911
They come? They feel honoured!

485
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:08,543
Dattubhai made many strugglers
Balaji serials' stars!

486
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:12,988
That's why our people call
Dattubhai, Dattu Satellite.

487
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:14,524
Fool! Then what!

488
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,924
You are new! That's why
I am telling you! - Okay!

489
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:18,427
Understand, kable man?

490
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,127
Great! Abuse too starting
with the letter K?

491
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,933
I have to do it!

492
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,870
That's why there is unity
only in our company.

493
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,610
Do you see this? Today,
again there is a party!

494
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,873
Liquor, feast and fun!

495
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:40,946
Do you see this?

496
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:43,145
First take him upstairs
and get him ready.

497
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,889
Then you come to the party.

498
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,215
Okay, bhai.
- Come on.

499
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,888
Come on! Pull it out.

500
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,260
Greetings!

501
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:33,325
Do you see this?
- Yes, bhai.

502
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,003
Such famous people have come
for Dattubhai's party.

503
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,398
Great, bhai!

504
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,999
Then don't say I didn't
introduce you to anybody!

505
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,340
Look, Hiten Tejwani with his wife.

506
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,670
What must be his age?

507
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,149
Must be younger than you.
Around 28-30 years.

508
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:51,952
Not 30! 300!
- 300!

509
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:54,085
Yes!
- What are you saying? Really?

510
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,219
No! In the serial!

511
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,552
Thank you!

512
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,024
Brother Prakash!

513
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,035
What will be the cost of calling
these TV stars to Ghatkopar..

514
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:12,565
..and making them dance
at my Rupesh's wedding?

515
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:14,701
But will they dance in the wedding?

516
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,044
When Hrithik and
Shah Rukh can dance..

517
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:18,672
..then why can't they?

518
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,108
True.

519
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:23,642
I will do one thing.
I will ask Dattubhai.

520
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:25,985
My work will be done for free!

521
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:30,257
Dattubhai!

522
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,362
Greetings, Dattubhai!
- Greetings, Dattubhai!

523
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,075
Greetings, bhai!
- Greetings!

524
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:46,200
Greetings, bhai!

525
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:50,737
Dattubhai! My pulse rate has gone
down working with Balaji!

526
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,680
You can check it!
- Yes! It's very low!

527
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,615
I have to work for 16 hours! Right?

528
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:55,743
Yes, Dattubhai!

529
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,082
For 16 hours!

530
00:30:57,154 --> 00:30:59,145
Balaji people are demanding
too much! Right?

531
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:00,281
Yes, Dattubhai!

532
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,416
I will see! I see! Tell me!

533
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,359
Excuse me! I too have to tell you!
- Yes! - Dattubhai!

534
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:07,363
When these poor
people ask for a pay raise. - Yes!

535
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:09,365
Then they threaten to increase
their age in the serial.

536
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,730
Yes! Yes! - Yes, Dattubhai!

537
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:13,099
In fact I have fainted
twice on the set..

538
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,264
..because of doing night
and day shifts everyday.

539
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,503
What happened? - She again fainted!

540
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,544
Dattubhai..
- I was just showing it!

541
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,107
Okay!
- Oh!

542
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:24,374
Dattubhai, your sister Priya
is nowhere to be seen!

543
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:28,544
She must be here itself!
Priya! Priya!

544
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,130
She is my sister! Priya!

545
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:41,255
Hi!
- Hi, Priya!

546
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,324
She gives tips for starving.

547
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,428
Brother, I am a dietician!

548
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,140
As such those who say that only
women watch your serials..

549
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,143
..they should come to our house.

550
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,206
Brother is your big fan!

551
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,541
Are you too interested in serials?

552
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:06,084
Yes! But only in cereals and pulses!

553
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,820
Come on! Enjoy! Enjoy! Enjoy!

554
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,794
Yes! Okay! - As it is we have
to suffer there! - Come on!

555
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,694
Hiten! Gauri!
- Greetings, Dattubhai!

556
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:15,754
Are you both fine?

557
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,358
Thank you! Thank you!

558
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,266
Dattubhai, we should thank you!

559
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,635
Because of you we got
a role in Balaji serial.

560
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,695
No!

561
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,199
Dattubhai, I want to talk to you.
- Yes.

562
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:31,846
Dattubhai, this year we both are
participating in Nach Baliye. - Okay.

563
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:36,745
So if we win..
- Dattubhai, setting.

564
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,382
Yes! Give me the judge's name!
Your work will be done!

565
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,188
Thank you, Dattubhai!
- Thank you, Dattubhai!

566
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,591
Enjoy! Enjoy!
- I will call you!

567
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,129
Okay! Enjoy! Enjoy!
- Come on!

568
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,128
Do you see that man with bhai?

569
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,264
Javed, how are you?

570
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:53,200
Javed! Encounter specialist!
- Is that so?

571
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,399
Bhai's special man!

572
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,540
Just know that one of us
likes to be a policeman!

573
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,276
What to do? Its Dattubhai's party.

574
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:05,747
I have to keep an eye
on those who come.

575
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,158
Sakshi! You wait here!

576
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,425
Javed, how are you?
- Fine!

577
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,887
So less!
- Yes!

578
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,626
Give it to him!
- Yes, sir!

579
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,429
Bhai, sister-in-law.

580
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,836
Future sister-in-law! Sakshi!

581
00:33:29,306 --> 00:33:30,295
Okay!

582
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,231
You look good!

583
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,908
Come on, kids! Come on!
Come on! Come on! - Excuse me!

584
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:40,706
Sakshi!

585
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:45,918
Thanks for coming to my party!

586
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:50,851
Dattubhai, how can I not
come to your party?

587
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:55,261
Sakshi! Do consider my party too!

588
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:58,267
If along with Tulsi, Parvati
too joins your party..

589
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:00,735
..then your luck will shine.

590
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,262
Dattubhai, you too!

591
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:08,536
Dattubhai.. I want to
personally talk to you.

592
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:10,546
Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

593
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,271
Excuse me!
- Come!

594
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,939
Tell me, Sakshi!

595
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:16,216
You know, Dattubhai.

596
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,883
I am having some problem with Balaji.
- Okay.

597
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,290
I asked for a raise
and Balaji people..

598
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,693
..are threatening to replace me.

599
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:27,822
Okay.

600
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:30,458
They say I will meet with
an accident in the serial.

601
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:32,229
My plastic surgery will be done.

602
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,904
And my role will be given
to some other actress.

603
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,571
In the past four serials,
my face is shown covered in bandage.

604
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,637
If I considered their condition,
its fine.

605
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,311
Otherwise when the bandage
will be removed..

606
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:46,849
..somebody else's face
will be shown.

607
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,446
This is not fair, Dattubhai!

608
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,786
Now only you can do something.

609
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,255
Please.

610
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:04,594
Yes. You don't worry, Sakshi.
I will talk to them.

611
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:07,734
Its Dattubhai's words!
Dattu Satellite!

612
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,328
So sweet!

613
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,004
Come, I have to make
an important announcement!

614
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,670
Sure!
- Come! Come!

615
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,804
Come!

616
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,349
Everybody! Everybody!

617
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:23,884
Everybody was asking why
I have given this party.

618
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:30,419
Let me tell you that my sister
Priya's wedding has been fixed.

619
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:34,355
Wow! Congratulations!

620
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,294
Come! One photo!
- Sure!

621
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,360
One photo! One photo!
- Hi, guys!

622
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:43,031
Wait! Come, Sakshi!
- Congratulations!

623
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,301
One photo! Yes!

624
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,303
Smile please!

625
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,322
Leave! Buy something else!

626
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:21,000
Hey! That!

627
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,478
This hen too!

628
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:32,522
Whenever I come to this mall,
she acts like this!

629
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,358
Shall I devour her!

630
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,949
What do you say?

631
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,028
Follow her! We will handle her!

632
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:46,625
She..

633
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,368
Today I will kill her!

634
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,099
Catch her!

635
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,939
Babes!

636
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:02,576
I am waiting since long!

637
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,120
On the phone, you said
it's very urgent!

638
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:08,647
Gum!

639
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,116
Hello!

640
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,563
You can't give me anything
else besides sorrow.

641
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,591
What happened?

642
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,134
Brother has fixed my marriage.
- What!

643
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:19,994
With whom?

644
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,470
Brother has chosen the guy.
So you can take a guess.

645
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,804
After marriage a girl
goes to another house.

646
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:27,901
And I will go from one
gang to the other.

647
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,939
Akki, is the money in
our savings not enough?

648
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:33,675
What can we do with that, babes?

649
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,412
We are leaving the country!

650
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:37,480
We will have to start from zero!

651
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,553
We will have to do proper planning.

652
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,488
You continue with your planning.
Okay, Akki?

653
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,617
In the near future,
I will have to do..

654
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:44,956
..family planning
with somebody else!

655
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:46,554
Fool!

656
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,155
Priya! Please, Priya!
You know I am trying!

657
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,156
Trying?

658
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,834
People like you say
I love you before marriage.

659
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,963
And when marriage is discussed,
what have I done!

660
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,501
Oh! By the way, it's said
a special person..

661
00:37:58,575 --> 00:38:01,066
..should be given the
first wedding card!

662
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:06,905
What joke is this, Priya?

663
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:12,518
Joke? You have been joking with me!

664
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:15,523
Those dreams you showed
about our marriage..

665
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:18,117
..about taking me away
from this place!

666
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,123
All those promises!

667
00:38:20,864 --> 00:38:22,525
Whenever I ask about money, you say..

668
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,793
..don't worry, everything
will be done.

669
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,900
Now you don't have to do anything!

670
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,603
I am getting married and
that too to a goon!

671
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,908
It's true that I love you, Akki.

672
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:41,951
But it's also true that
love is blind.

673
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:45,154
That's why I couldn't see that
you are not capable of it!

674
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,949
People like you can love
but not maintain it.

675
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,220
By the way, the wedding is on
the 30th of the next month!

676
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:58,025
Do come! At least you
can dare to do this!

677
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:05,571
Only your name is Akshay
Kumar! Coward!

678
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,614
School homework.

679
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,955
My father, my hero. 200 lines!

680
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,951
If you say just 10 lines
then too it's enough!

681
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,560
What do you mean?

682
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,299
You start quarrelling everyday
in the morning.

683
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,159
Don't make me open my mouth
in front of our child!

684
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:09,171
Other fathers are doctors,
engineers or at least clerks!

685
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,228
But you!

686
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,638
Gayatri, stop it!

687
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,302
You always harp
about the same thing!

688
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:16,573
Then make me quiet!

689
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,614
You tell people you do marketing!
Are you ashamed?

690
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,580
Look, its enough!

691
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,787
Yes, it's enough!

692
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,652
At the time of marriage,
your parents showed me..

693
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:28,315
..your waist length photo
and they fooled me!

694
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,620
Since then I have been
tolerating you!

695
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,222
Wherever I go, people ask me
what work your husband does!

696
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,063
I have to keep quiet! My bad luck!

697
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,725
I am ashamed to go out with you!

698
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,196
I am suffering and
you are saying it's enough!

699
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,328
Papa! - God knows what destiny..

700
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,703
I got married to you.
- What happened?

701
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,063
It's my shirt!

702
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,148
Whenever I raise this topic,
why do you run away?

703
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,811
If you have the guts then tell him
about the work you do!

704
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:57,676
If he hears it,
he will dance with joy!

705
00:40:57,754 --> 00:40:59,779
His essay will receive
the first prize!

706
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,155
People from the school will
form a queue to see you!

707
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,694
People will buy tickets to see you!

708
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:06,661
The 8th wonder of the world!
- Shut up!

709
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:06,722
You always asked me what
your papa does! Look!

710
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:17,223
Now tell me! Will you come with
me or stay with this hen?

711
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,171
Ayush! Ayush!

712
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:42,082
He has not done a favour on us..

713
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,854
..by saving our money
from Ghazal Ul Rehman!

714
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,257
And he has saved his son's money!

715
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,262
If he asks about the garland,
I will tell him.

716
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,766
Then what!

717
00:42:51,134 --> 00:42:52,192
Purshottam!

718
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:58,469
Why have you used plastic garland
for your mother's photo?

719
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,403
I don't want the trouble of
changing garland everyday.

720
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,467
What!

721
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:03,871
And if we wash it on
Sunday and reuse it..

722
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:05,471
..then it will look fresh too.

723
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:07,274
Yes!

724
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,876
Why to spend 60 rupees every
month unnecessarily?

725
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,786
Its not that the photo will
feel the fragrance!

726
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:17,086
You should be ashamed!

727
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,500
I have told you so many times!

728
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,508
It's my money and not Purshottam's!

729
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:33,838
Still dude, to solve our problems..

730
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,401
..to exhort money from Purshottam..

731
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,469
No way!

732
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,078
Look, you have tried so hard
to arrange for the money.

733
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,515
Anything happened?
- But that doesn't mean..

734
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:45,515
At times you don't have to see
what is right and wrong!

735
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,523
You have to consider the
situation and time!

736
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,183
You are saying that Purshottam
will reform!

737
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,227
He is a dog's tail! It
will not straighten!

738
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,920
Now I will recover the money anyhow.

739
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:55,464
And I know that the means
to do it is wrong!

740
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,329
No, some people only understand
foul means!

741
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:00,263
But still, dude! 1 crore
is not a small amount.

742
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,869
If at a critical moment,
Purshottam..

743
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:04,873
..doesn't endure the shock
of losing the money..

744
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:05,999
..and if he files
a police complaint..

745
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,941
..then its Mumbai police.

746
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:09,069
They won't spare us.

747
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,204
Again I am telling you!

748
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,338
We don't have to commit
a robbery at gun point!

749
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,008
We just have to threaten
on the phone!

750
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,857
Yes! That's true!

751
00:44:26,596 --> 00:44:28,894
The last time, I called him
just as a single gangster..

752
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:30,091
..and he was so scared.

753
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,492
If we called him as a gang then..

754
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,059
I will just call him!

755
00:44:34,137 --> 00:44:38,164
Hey, fool! Wait! Akki is right.

756
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:39,970
We will make the call using
the pseudo name of a gang.

757
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:44,912
No, dude. Using our gang's name!

758
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,888
But what to name the gang?

759
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:56,316
We will think of such a name that..

760
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,588
..hearing it, Purshottam
should get scared!

761
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,387
Think, brother! Think!

762
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,326
How about Bol Bachchan company?

763
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,457
No, brother!

764
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:06,593
To change our fate, it won't be
right to involve Mr. Bachchan!

765
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,064
Found it! Extortion organisation!

766
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,606
Dude, we are thinking
of a gang's name.

767
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,909
Not to collect charity
for Lord Ganesh.

768
00:45:14,177 --> 00:45:15,235
It's been 2 days.

769
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,906
I was not so worried even while
keeping my son's name.

770
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,105
Uncle, what difference does it make?

771
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:24,918
We just have to make a call.
Keep any name! A, B, C, D!

772
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:28,183
Hang on, brother! We can't call it D!

773
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,321
Somebody else has the copyrights!

774
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,621
But we can call it C.
- C! C means..

775
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:39,933
If its about numerology then
we will call the company K.

776
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:42,398
If serials and movies can be
a hit then why not a gang?

777
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:45,202
Brother, there is a reason behind C!
- What?

778
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,640
It's our house's name!

779
00:45:48,678 --> 00:45:50,646
"C! C! C! C!"

780
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:54,242
"We are going to call C Kkompany!"

781
00:45:54,317 --> 00:45:56,148
See! We all live in the
C wing of the society!

782
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:57,644
So C Kkompany!

783
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,115
Nice name! We will fix it!
- Yes!

784
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:01,988
C Kkompany!
- Who is it?

785
00:46:02,058 --> 00:46:04,993
Hey, if you disconnect without
hearing me out..

786
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:06,460
..I will destroy you!

787
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,061
Go ahead! Go ahead!

788
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:11,532
And listen to me carefully,
if you want to live..

789
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:18,339
Look! Bhai (Don).. I
think you don't know.

790
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:21,973
Ghazal Ul Rehman.. you must
have heard his name.

791
00:46:22,445 --> 00:46:25,972
Actually brother Ghazlu
is our family friend.

792
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:30,075
If he found out then..
- Hang on! Hang on!

793
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,416
He is giving threats of Ghazlu!
- What!

794
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,151
Hello!

795
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,284
Disconnect! Disconnect!

796
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,028
Great! Again a gangster had called!

797
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,262
Hearing Ghazal Ul Rehman's
name, he disconnected!

798
00:46:47,737 --> 00:46:50,103
May brother Ghazlu live for long!
- Yes!

799
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,698
Enmity with C Kkompany! Fool!

800
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:02,173
How was it?

801
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,717
What a shot! Right?

802
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,019
Very real! Very real!

803
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:11,054
Enmity with C Kkompany! Fool!

804
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,232
Hello.

805
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,034
I am calling from C Kkompany.

806
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:32,612
Tomorrow is your family friend's
fourth day death ceremony.

807
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:37,050
I have killed Ghazal
Ul Rehman in the DVD.

808
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,555
If you didn't give me 1 crore
then your state too..

809
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,752
No! No, bhai! I am ready to pay it!

810
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,488
But it will take time!

811
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:48,220
Listen! He is ready to give money!

812
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,629
But he is asking for time!

813
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,501
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

814
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,094
We should get the money anyhow..

815
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:56,763
..before 30th of the next month.

816
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,102
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

817
00:47:58,174 --> 00:47:59,232
Before 30th!

818
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,073
I want the money before the
30th of the next month.

819
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,774
Otherwise I will kill
you as the month ends.

820
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,239
Whose call was it?

821
00:48:08,718 --> 00:48:09,707
C Kkompany!

822
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,121
Father! Father! Father!

823
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:20,090
C Kkompany had called! They
have demanded 1 crore!

824
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:24,066
They.. they killed your
Ghazal Ul Rehman!

825
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,396
They killed Ghazlu!
- Yes! Yes!

826
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,128
Do you know any other goon?

827
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,248
In this matter who can give
us better advice than you?

828
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:41,708
So I brought him here.

829
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:45,112
Look! He killed him so brutally!

830
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:47,152
If we didn't pay him 1 crore then..

831
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:49,191
..they will do the same
thing with him.

832
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,248
They have threatened
him saying this.

833
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:54,361
C Kkompany! I never heard of it!

834
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:56,163
Had you heard Ghazal Ul
Rehman's name before?

835
00:48:58,234 --> 00:48:59,496
No.
- Then!

836
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,159
Yes!

837
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:08,538
Look.. I would advice you not
to take their threats lightly.

838
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,707
They are very dangerous.
They mean business.

839
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:23,826
Give them the money before the
30th. And save your life.

840
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:26,854
Akki is right.

841
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:31,163
Look, son. If you save your
life then you can earn more.

842
00:49:35,638 --> 00:49:39,165
I think I will have to give 1 crore!

843
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:47,816
"C Kkompany! C Kkompany!"

844
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:51,342
Friends, today's drink
in 1 crore's name!

845
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:52,679
Cheers!

846
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,204
"My! O My!"

847
00:50:13,576 --> 00:50:14,634
"Everybody earns."

848
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:15,769
"This is our slogan!"

849
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:16,834
"One time!"

850
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,305
"My! O My!"

851
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:19,439
"Everybody earns."

852
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,574
"This is our slogan!"

853
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,708
"Come on!"

854
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,218
"One more time check it out!"

855
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,578
"Let's go get it!"

856
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:28,746
"Do you smell it?"

857
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,460
"When we will get hold of a crore.."

858
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,723
"Our luck will change."

859
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,924
"Crore will bring happiness."

860
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,257
"Crore! Crore!"

861
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:43,367
"lf you have money,
people greet you."

862
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,536
"Money makes your kin and
strangers your salve."

863
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:52,339
"Wherever you go, people will
talk to you respectfully."

864
00:50:52,415 --> 00:50:56,943
"Money is acclaimed everywhere."

865
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,818
"Crore! Crore!"

866
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:04,525
"Crore! Crore!"

867
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,953
"When I will have a crore.."

868
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,391
"My future will be bright."

869
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,765
"Crore will solve my problem."

870
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,963
"Crore! Crore!"

871
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:19,805
"You want it! I want it! Come
on, let's make that honey!"

872
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:24,370
"You need it! I need it! Come
on, let's take that money!"

873
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:30,444
"One time! You feel it! I feel it!
Come on!"

874
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,782
"One time!"

875
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:32,981
"You think you are Akshay!"

876
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:34,381
"Let's rob a bank."

877
00:51:34,457 --> 00:51:35,583
"That's the way to get rich."

878
00:51:35,658 --> 00:51:36,716
"But if you get caught up.."

879
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:37,851
"Be the first to snitch."

880
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:38,985
"Because its half past 12."

881
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,324
"And I am feeling that itch."

882
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:41,454
"l need to get that money."

883
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:42,589
"Because my life is lousy."

884
00:51:42,665 --> 00:51:43,723
"So switch places fast!"

885
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,926
"It's a thing of the past."

886
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:45,990
"l hate being broke!"

887
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:47,860
"So pop the champagne."

888
00:51:47,937 --> 00:51:48,995
"Let me fill up my plans."

889
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,266
"l live life king size."

890
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,009
"l will have bungalow,
cars and servants."

891
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,437
"l will have lockers in the bank."

892
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,708
"We will have fun together."

893
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:01,011
"Money is so powerful."

894
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,416
"Time will be better."

895
00:52:03,486 --> 00:52:05,545
"Our life will be better."

896
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,817
"Our dreams will come true."

897
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,018
"Money is so powerful."

898
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,022
"Crore! Crore!"

899
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:17,560
"Crore! Crore!"

900
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,593
"l am feeling hot."

901
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,031
"Did you ask me?"

902
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:25,568
"Show me your magic God."

903
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:31,569
"Crore! Crore!"

904
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,916
"Crore! Crore!"

905
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,357
"Crore!"

906
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:48,761
"C Kkompany!"
- "Love of that."

907
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:51,061
"C Kkompany!"
- "Come on, dude."

908
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,068
"C Kkompany!"
- "l can do."

909
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,928
"C Kkompany!"
- "Hail to it!"

910
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:57,996
"C Kkompany!"
- "Love of that."

911
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:00,474
"C Kkompany!"
- "Come on dude."

912
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,067
"C Kkompany!"

00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,880
"C Kkompany!"
- "Hail to it!"

914
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:07,075
"C Kkompany!
- Love of that."

915
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,482
"C Kkompany!"
- "Come on dude."

916
00:53:09,552 --> 00:53:11,747
"C Kkompany!"
- "l can do."

917
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,085
"C Kkompany!"
- "Hail to it!"

918
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,413
"C Kkompany!"

919
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:17,415
"C Kkompany!"

920
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,654
"C Kkompany!"

921
00:53:20,763 --> 00:53:21,821
"C Kkompany!"

922
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:22,956
"Crore! Come on."

923
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:37,103
Why don't you change this ring-tone?

924
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,774
It feels as if we are
sleeping at the border.

925
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,676
This phone too! Did you
buy it from JP Dutta?

926
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:54,930
Boss's call! Hello!

927
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,465
Hello, Akshay!
- Yes, sir!

928
00:53:56,532 --> 00:53:58,397
Did you watch our breaking news?
- No, sir!

929
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:01,497
Quickly watch it!
It's sensational!

930
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,938
- Our TRPs are touching
the sky! We are rocking!

931
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:05,997
Quickly watch it!

932
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:11,140
Who are the gang members
of C Kkompany?

933
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:14,939
Who is the man who has been
murdered in the DVD?

934
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:18,681
What's the motive for
this brutal murder?

935
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:23,454
Is it that C Kkompany wants
to spread terror in Mumbai?

936
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:26,454
There are many questions
but no answer!

937
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:29,493
The scene which you are watching
on your TV screen..

938
00:54:29,565 --> 00:54:30,896
..it has been taken from this DVD.

939
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:34,994
I don't believe this!

940
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,136
This is too much, dude!

941
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,774
But why did you leave this
DVD in your office?

942
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,511
Purshottam was ready
to give the money..

943
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:46,707
..and I forgot the DVD there!

944
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,175
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!

945
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,485
A big problem, dude!

946
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,520
Forget extortion!

947
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:55,614
Now we might be behind
bars for murder!

948
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,525
I think the government will look
after the rest of my life!

949
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,492
Uncle, no need to do melodrama.

950
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:07,869
Think that we are getting free
publicity of our company.

951
00:55:09,872 --> 00:55:12,067
People spend lakhs.

952
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:15,542
Lambodhar, you too!
No need to worry!

953
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:17,807
Only we know about C Kkompany!

954
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,472
And this is how the media works!
- Yes.

955
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:23,215
It will splash the news for two
days and then forget about it!

956
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:25,553
And as it is there is still
time for the 29th!

957
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,524
But the police won't forget it!

958
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,220
The investigation will
begin and we all..

959
00:55:33,896 --> 00:55:36,763
Hang on! Already I can hear
the police's siren!

960
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:38,790
Even I can hear the siren!

961
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,001
Mr. Chawle, you!

962
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:04,159
It's a serious matter!
It's a serious matter!

963
00:56:05,928 --> 00:56:08,726
I want to interrogate
you about C Kkompany!

964
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:13,728
Who are they?

965
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,794
They.. Iive in my building.

966
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:19,734
Okay!

967
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:20,867
But Mr. Chawle..

968
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:22,843
Since the morning, Dattubhai
has called 10 times!

969
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,943
Find out quickly what
is this C Kkompany!

970
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,684
Did you watch the news on the TV?
- Yes!

971
00:56:29,952 --> 00:56:31,283
Did you?
- Yes!

972
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,145
Your channel has telecasted
the story!

973
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,614
Since the morning, commissioner
and Dattubhai..

974
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:36,817
..both are harassing me!

975
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,690
Come on! Dattubhai has called!
Come quickly!

976
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:42,822
"C Kkompany!"

977
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:44,891
"C Kkompany!"

978
00:56:47,336 --> 00:56:48,564
Look, don't do this!

979
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,300
We will be ruined, Mr. Malya!

980
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,633
If my sister doesn't marry
your son Aryaman..

981
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,941
..then we won't be able to face
the society, Mr. Malya!

982
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:00,579
Please try and understand!

983
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:03,910
We have even distributed
the wedding cards!

984
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,615
So what can we do?

985
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:08,587
Get your sister married
to somebody else!

986
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,122
For God's sake, don't
do this! Don't do this!

987
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,662
I beg to you!

988
00:57:16,732 --> 00:57:20,691
No! No, brother! Don't do this!

989
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,930
For my sake, no need to beg to them!

990
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,607
As it is, you have arthritis!

991
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:37,683
Beat them for the whole year!

992
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:39,880
How are you? - How are you?
- You are exactly on time.

993
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:40,945
How are things going on?

994
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:42,680
Bring tea! Bring tea!

995
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:46,689
Mr. Chawle, I was just wondering
that when Akshay..

996
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:49,788
..will be 47 years old then you
know what people will call him?

997
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,089
What?

998
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:54,928
Tell me!

999
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:55,993
AK 47!

1000
00:57:58,975 --> 00:57:59,964
Come! I will call bhai (Don)!

1001
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:03,303
Mom! Dad! I have decided!

1002
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,248
I will marry only.. Ananya!

1003
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,362
But I can't marry Aryaman!
Yes, brother!

1004
00:58:22,064 --> 00:58:24,032
There is a secret behind this!

1005
00:58:25,868 --> 00:58:30,032
I am carrying Aryaman's younger
brother Suryaman's child!

1006
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:43,340
Bhai!

1007
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,410
They have come!

1008
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:48,483
Are you in a state to meet them?

1009
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,185
Yes, tell them to sit!

1010
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,752
Okay! I will make them sit!

1011
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,997
"Relationships change form."

1012
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,090
Bhai, Balaji is ringing!

1013
00:59:00,102 --> 00:59:01,091
"New.."

1014
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,163
Hello. - Dattubhai!

1015
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,307
Yes, Sakshi! Yes!

1016
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:11,710
Dattubhai! From 4 episodes
now its 16 episodes!

1017
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:15,773
Balaji has still covered
my face with the bandage!

1018
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:19,719
Sakshi, don't worry! Don't worry!

1019
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:22,755
Dattu Satellite has
given you his word!

1020
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,784
Whenever the bandage will be opened..

1021
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:27,726
..your face will be behind it!

1022
00:59:28,497 --> 00:59:32,160
I trust you, Dattubhai! You
are so sweet, you know!

1023
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,025
Thank you so much!

1024
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,893
Take care, baby!

1025
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,029
Baby?

1026
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,741
Yes! Bhai has come!

1027
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:44,743
Chawle! Is everything fine? - Yes.

Brother..

00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,419
Sorry!

1033
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:00,484
Hang on! Hang on!

1034
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,760
Her marriage has been
fixed! Do you know?

1035
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:06,762
30th of the next month!

1036
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:08,826
Congratulations!

1037
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,227
Thank you!

1038
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:11,495
Congratulations!

1039
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:13,966
All the best! - Thank you!

1040
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,299
Thank you!

1041
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:22,179
Chawle! Found out about C Kkompany?

1042
01:00:23,552 --> 01:00:26,851
No, bhai! Since the
morning I am trying.

1043
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,291
I have contacted all my informers.

1044
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:33,123
But still no information!

1045
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,794
Bhai, no news!

1046
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:41,268
But I feel some old player
is behind C Kkompany!

1047
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:45,531
Not old!

1048
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:51,478
If it had been an old player then
I would have known by now.

1049
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,084
It's a new company! Kill them!

1050
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,954
Kill them! No, bhai!

1051
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:01,885
If you even paid them attention..

1052
01:01:01,957 --> 01:01:03,219
..then their prestige will rise.

1053
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,419
Bhai, such goons are
like Himesh's songs.

1054
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:08,488
They are common in the market.

1055
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,298
You are like Rehman. Evergreen.

1056
01:01:12,968 --> 01:01:14,492
And bhai, such small goons..

1057
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:18,836
Akki, such small goons in
the future, grow big.

1058
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:26,047
I say get rid of them before
they reach great heights!

1059
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,110
You are right.
Find out who they are!

1060
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,856
We will kill them
in their locality!

1061
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:39,516
Okay!

1062
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:50,866
Hi, babes!

1063
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,045
Maybe you don't know that
my wedding has been fixed.

1064
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,612
And I have stopped meeting
unknown men.

1065
01:02:06,288 --> 01:02:07,312
I just came here to tell you that.

1066
01:02:08,557 --> 01:02:09,615
Idiot!

1067
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,489
I have arranged for
the money! I swear!

1068
01:02:13,028 --> 01:02:14,017
Say it again!

1069
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:16,327
I have arranged for the money!

1070
01:02:19,568 --> 01:02:21,900
Priya! Priya! Behave yourself!

1071
01:02:22,404 --> 01:02:23,530
Everybody is watching!

1072
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:24,595
So?

1073
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:26,469
You too! - Sir, coke!

1074
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,669
- Not coke! Diet coke!

1075
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:31,906
What are you doing, Priya?
People are here!

1076
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:50,064
"Don't know what is wrong with me."

1077
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:53,659
"What do I say, I am always lost."

1078
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:57,996
"l don't understand anything."

1079
01:02:58,073 --> 01:03:00,633
"What kind of journey is this?"

1080
01:03:00,709 --> 01:03:04,543
"Don't know where my heart..

1081
01:03:04,613 --> 01:03:07,582
..is taking me."

1082
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:12,410
"Where has my dream..

1083
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:15,321
..brought me to."

1084
01:03:29,638 --> 01:03:35,372
"l feel like recommending."

1085
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:37,503
"Recommending."

1086
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:43,416
"Don't know what it is requesting."

1087
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:45,350
"Requesting."

1088
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:51,724
"Lord, listen to me,
what kind of problem is this?"

1089
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:57,198
"Lord, listen to me."

1090
01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:00,997
"Lord, listen to me."

1091
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:05,401
"l am walking on your path."

1092
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,539
"I've forgotten this world."

1093
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:28,491
"How can I express my love?"

1094
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,657
"How can l?

1095
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:36,501
"How can it be said in two words?"

1096
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,472
"Said in two words?"

1097
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:45,275
"Lord, listen to me,
what kind of problem is this?"

1098
01:04:46,448 --> 01:04:50,509
"Lord, listen to me."

1099
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:54,215
"Lord, listen to me."

1100
01:04:55,357 --> 01:04:59,054
"Love me and touch me, baby."

1101
01:04:59,461 --> 01:05:03,056
"Come on, set me free.
- Set me free."

1102
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:09,863
"l got you here with me."

1103
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:13,500
"What do I do with rains?"

1104
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:17,471
"Think, why I am feeling like this."

1105
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:21,409
"The paths are whispering
in my ears."

1106
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:24,344
"Where am I walking."

1107
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,083
"With the sunshine
in my hands of morning..

1108
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,224
..and the colors of evening."

1109
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:53,444
"Somebody listen to the new talks."

1110
01:05:53,515 --> 01:06:01,354
"l am reaching the sky."

1111
01:06:01,423 --> 01:06:08,556
"Lord, listen to me,
what kind of problem is this?"

1112
01:06:09,264 --> 01:06:13,200
"Lord, listen to me."

1113
01:06:13,268 --> 01:06:16,465
"Lord, listen to me."

1114
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,142
"Lord, listen to me."

1115
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:32,148
"Lord, listen to me."

1116
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:34,745
148, sir!

1117
01:06:36,825 --> 01:06:37,814
Here.

1118
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,518
Here.

1119
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:42,155
Joshi!
- Pradhan!

1120
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,229
No matter how many vitamin
pills you take..

1121
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:48,633
..you won't become 16 from 61!

1122
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:50,228
Someday you will die!

1123
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:53,240
But do you remember
the after life deal?

1124
01:06:53,308 --> 01:06:55,538
Yes! Rambha is mine!
And Urvashi is yours!

1125
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:59,510
That is if we go to heaven!

1126
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:04,875
Pradhan!

1127
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:13,820
Joshi, I am living in the hell
here. God is not so unkind!

1128
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:17,254
What's the matter?

1129
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:21,725
Now, I feel, we will have
to vacate this shanty.

1130
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,936
We went to the court and the police.

1131
01:07:26,341 --> 01:07:27,933
But who listens to the common man?

1132
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:33,203
People like us save each penny
and make our houses.

1133
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:38,284
People like us who hang
on the trains and buses..

1134
01:07:38,353 --> 01:07:41,516
..feel peaceful in this
flat of 280 sq feet.

1135
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:47,294
Now some builder called Patel
wants to demolish our houses..

1136
01:07:47,362 --> 01:07:51,560
..with the bulldozer using
the help of underworld.

1137
01:07:51,633 --> 01:07:53,828
So that he could build
a shopping mall here!

1138
01:07:56,405 --> 01:08:00,705
I won't be able to see it, Joshi!
I won't be able to see it!

1139
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:09,712
At times, I feel, we should snatch
and not ask for our rights!

1140
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:16,254
If I had known some
gangster or company..

1141
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:18,452
..then today this wouldn't
have happened.

1142
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,319
A phone call would have
solved this problem.

1143
01:08:21,396 --> 01:08:24,263
Just one phone call! One phone call!

1144
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,831
In the past 30 years I didn't
see Pradhan so dejected.

1145
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,736
We have made our company.

1146
01:08:33,842 --> 01:08:36,538
We will make one call and kill
two birds with one stone.

1147
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:39,814
But uncle, if Akki found out..

1148
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:41,372
He will find out only if we tell him.

1149
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,285
We just have to make a phone call.

1150
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:48,018
We can't convince Patel builder
with just a phone call.

1151
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,348
To convince him..

1152
01:08:50,425 --> 01:08:52,290
We will have to make another
DVD. I am ready.

1153
01:08:53,428 --> 01:08:55,293
Will you open a DVD library?

1154
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:58,833
There is a difference between
Purshottam and Patel.

1155
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:01,296
Didn't you read the newspaper?

1156
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,666
He has connection
with the underworld.

1157
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,575
We will have to plan something else!

1158
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,640
"C Kkompany."

1159
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:14,310
"C Kkompany."

1160
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,748
"C Kkompany."

1161
01:09:16,818 --> 01:09:17,876
"C Kkompany."

1162
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:19,818
We have to begin Radhabai
shanty's work.

1163
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:21,589
It's urgent! I told you!

1164
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:23,517
If you delay it then there
will be a problem!

1165
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,855
You don't understand! Come on!
- Okay, sir.

1166
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:29,329
I gave you a job! Got it? Idiot!

1167
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:30,687
Hello!

1168
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:33,793
Uncle!

1169
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:34,858
Patel has left!

1170
01:09:35,637 --> 01:09:37,730
Now you do what we have planned!

1171
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:40,432
Make the first call after 10 minutes.

1172
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,603
And the second call after
half an hour. Got it?

1173
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:48,877
And uncle, be firm. We should
look like professionals.

1174
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:52,075
"C Kkompany."

1175
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:56,613
"C Kkompany."

1176
01:09:58,427 --> 01:09:59,416
"C Kkompany."

1177
01:10:09,571 --> 01:10:10,560
"C Kkompany."

1178
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:13,934
Hello!

1179
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:18,105
Hey, builder! I am calling
from C Kkompany!

1180
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,442
C Kkompany!

1181
01:10:19,514 --> 01:10:21,812
Listen to me carefully, otherwise
I will destroy you!

1182
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:23,708
You are threatening me!

1183
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,451
Hang up otherwise you don't know!

1184
01:10:26,521 --> 01:10:30,116
Look! Look, don't act so smart!

1185
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,654
I will call you after half an hour!

1186
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:37,690
First, save your life! There
is a bomb under your car!

1187
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,058
Bomb!

1188
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:41,034
Where? Driver, park at the side!

1189
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,161
To the side!
- Stop! Stop!

1190
01:10:42,237 --> 01:10:43,465
Quickly! To the side!

1191
01:10:43,538 --> 01:10:45,938
Oh my God! Is it beneath my seat!

1192
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:46,997
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1193
01:10:47,709 --> 01:10:49,574
Hey, what's going on?

1194
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,809
Run! Run!

1195
01:10:54,883 --> 01:11:00,480
Move! - There is a bomb in the car!

1196
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,781
"C Kkompany."

1197
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:08,885
Dattubhai!

1198
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:12,126
Some C Kkompany has planted
a bomb in my car.

1199
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,428
And I don't even know why.

1200
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,428
Please look into the matter.
I somehow saved my life.

1201
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,105
He said he will call again
after half an hour.

1202
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:23,440
Patel! Patel! Patel!
- Yes!

1203
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,545
Don't worry!
- Okay!

1204
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:29,106
Just give me the number from
which you got the call!

1205
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:30,173
Okay, Dattubhai!

1206
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:31,543
I will handle the rest!
- Okay!

1207
01:11:56,778 --> 01:11:58,143
Listen, what's the time?

1208
01:11:58,213 --> 01:11:59,202
12:35!
- Okay!

1209
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,609
Come on! Hurry up!

1210
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:12,652
Sir! What's going on?
- Akki, you have come!

1211
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:13,786
What do you say?

1212
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:15,557
People are planting
bomb beneath the car!

1213
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:16,619
Is it a terrorist group's doing?

1214
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:19,164
Has Halkadar again done something?

1215
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,498
No! Its some underworld's doing!

1216
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:24,228
What are you saying? People from
the company have done this!

1217
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:27,507
They have stooped to this level!
- Just see this!

1218
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,635
By the way who is it?
- Some C Kkompany!

1219
01:12:30,712 --> 01:12:33,146
Come on! Move them! Come on!

1220
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:34,771
C Kkompany!

1221
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:36,141
Yes, it's some new company.

1222
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,813
They have earned so much fame.
They should be killed.

1223
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,523
Let them go! Move!

1224
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,522
Tulaskar! I will just come!
- Okay!

1225
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:50,160
Look there! Go back! Go back!

1226
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,590
Come on! Move!

1227
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:57,229
C Kkompany is responsible
for planting this bomb!

1228
01:12:57,739 --> 01:13:00,606
You will remember that this
is the same C Kkompany..

1229
01:13:00,675 --> 01:13:02,609
..who had made that murder DVD..

1230
01:13:02,677 --> 01:13:04,008
..a few weeks ago to spread
its terror in the city!

1231
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:05,137
Is it okay?

1232
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,549
You people handle it.
I will just come. - Okay! - Go.

1233
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:16,750
Yes, Dattubhai.
I have tapped the number.

1234
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:17,883
Is it a cell number?

1235
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:19,722
No, from a PCO outside Sion station!

1236
01:13:21,229 --> 01:13:22,218
I am leaving!

1237
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:25,892
You reach there! I am coming!
Come on! - Yes, bhai!

1238
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:33,267
"C Kkompany!"

1239
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,574
Patel, somebody has played
a prank with you! - What!

1240
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:42,105
A cracker bomb!

1241
01:13:46,988 --> 01:13:48,717
"C Kkompany."
- Hello! - "C Kkompany."

1242
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:51,987
Don't think this was a joke,
Mr. Patel! Idiot!

1243
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:56,654
We just wanted to show
you that if today..

1244
01:13:56,731 --> 01:14:00,667
..we can plant a cracker
bomb under your car..

1245
01:14:00,735 --> 01:14:03,761
..then its not difficult
to plant RDX tomorrow.

1246
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,874
Return Radhabai shanty's papers.

1247
01:14:07,275 --> 01:14:08,640
And end the matter.

1248
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,077
You have two days.
- Okay!

1249
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:25,688
But if you don't return the papers..

1250
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,025
..then the next DVD shown
on the TV will be yours!

1251
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:37,637
Think carefully. I won't
call again to explain!

1252
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,900
"C Kkompany."

1253
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:45,344
"C Kkompany."

1254
01:15:21,182 --> 01:15:24,413
Why to kill him! He will
die any moment now.

1255
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,386
Hey, have some manners!

1256
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:28,882
He seems to be someone else.

1257
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,755
Yes bhai (Don), he can't be the one.

1258
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,428
I have seen this uncle
in Akshay's house.

1259
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:38,762
Uncle, did you spot anyone
making a call earlier?

1260
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:41,263
Seems like we missed him!

1261
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:44,199
Easy! Easy! Easy, uncle!

1262
01:15:44,272 --> 01:15:46,399
Don't be tensed! Don't be tensed!

1263
01:15:46,474 --> 01:15:50,433
Relax, uncle!
Relax, Don't be tensed!

1264
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,275
Take a deep breath!
- Take a deep breath!

1265
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:53,405
Hey fatso.
- Yes, bhai!

1266
01:15:53,481 --> 01:15:54,846
Come on, pick up the bag and
call the black and yellow.

1267
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:55,905
Taxi!
- Come on.

1268
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:01,945
Bhai, this note!
- Uncle!

1269
01:16:03,391 --> 01:16:04,380
Your note.

1270
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:08,792
Uncle, here's your note.

1271
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:10,455
It is my medicine prescription!

1272
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:11,931
Do take it before you die.

1273
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,058
Come, I will drop you.

1274
01:16:13,134 --> 01:16:14,123
Stop.

1275
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:17,798
It was our bad luck!

1276
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:20,270
We had made so many arrangements.

1277
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:21,331
Jawle.

1278
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,811
If we would have laid our
hands on the C Kkompany..

1279
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:26,814
..then I would have killed all of
them today itself. - Absolutely.

1280
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:31,309
They have got another chance
to live on earth.

1281
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:40,017
Uncle. Say something.

1282
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:45,396
All my life I have lived
like a coward.

1283
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:50,828
But today,
when I saw death so close..

1284
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,232
..I forgot all my fears.

1285
01:16:55,443 --> 01:16:58,879
For the first time,
I feel that.. I am alive.

1286
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:03,113
I am rocking.
- You are not rocking!

1287
01:17:03,184 --> 01:17:05,243
What if it would have been him
instead of you in the PCO?

1288
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,378
Then?

1289
01:17:06,454 --> 01:17:07,512
Would he have been alive?

1290
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:08,851
If you would have called
just to scare him..

1291
01:17:08,923 --> 01:17:09,981
..then I would have understood it.

1292
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,116
But planting a bomb!
- A cracker bomb.

1293
01:17:11,192 --> 01:17:13,023
And threatening
to plant RDX tomorrow.

1294
01:17:13,094 --> 01:17:15,062
Your brain is just the
size of your height.

1295
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,529
Hey!
- What hey?

1296
01:17:16,931 --> 01:17:18,364
Now decide the menu of
your mourning rituals.

1297
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:20,924
I can see our photos in the obituary
section of the newspaper.

1298
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,532
The people were gradually
forgetting the DVD matter!

1299
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,198
And now you'll have gone ahead
and created another mess!

1300
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,532
We are in the breaking news!

1301
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:31,511
But we.. Akki, we didn't know
that this will become so big.

1302
01:17:31,579 --> 01:17:32,876
I thought, if this can benefit
someone else along with us..

1303
01:17:32,947 --> 01:17:34,539
..then what's bad in it.

1304
01:17:34,616 --> 01:17:36,447
And look, remember one thing.

1305
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:37,883
That DVD wasn't telecasted..

1306
01:17:37,952 --> 01:17:39,010
..on the National News
because of us.

1307
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,884
But that was a mistake
I made, brother.

1308
01:17:40,955 --> 01:17:42,946
But you have planned all this.

1309
01:17:43,024 --> 01:17:44,548
This time, the police too
won't take it lightly.

1310
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,218
And Dattubhai has even
seen you this time.

1311
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:48,421
God!

1312
01:17:48,496 --> 01:17:50,123
You too, brother..
- What me, brother?

1313
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:51,256
This idea must have been yours!

1314
01:17:51,332 --> 01:17:52,890
Uncle, look what he is saying!

1315
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:55,899
But the friend for whom
I did all this..

1316
01:17:55,970 --> 01:18:00,100
..did he benefit anything
out of all this or not?

1317
01:18:10,151 --> 01:18:12,915
Seeing the decorations
at Radhabai chawl..

1318
01:18:12,987 --> 01:18:15,979
..one might ask, is it Diwali today?

1319
01:18:16,057 --> 01:18:17,922
But, this day is no less
than any celebration..

1320
01:18:17,992 --> 01:18:19,584
..for the residents here.

1321
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,919
After many months, the people here..

1322
01:18:21,996 --> 01:18:24,191
..are smiling once again.

1323
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:25,926
And this smile is a gift to them..

1324
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,299
..from an underworld gang,
C Kkompany.

1325
01:18:32,006 --> 01:18:33,940
So come, let us talk to the
secretary of this chawl..

1326
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:36,272
..Mr. Sadashiv Pradhan.

1327
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,312
Mr. Pradhan, greetings.
- Greetings.

1328
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,942
So Mr. Pradhan, Patel Builders have..

1329
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:43,108
..withdrawn the claim
that they had made!

1330
01:18:43,184 --> 01:18:46,017
How do you feel on getting
your place back?

1331
01:18:46,087 --> 01:18:47,952
To tell you the truth, we
didn't just get our homes..

1332
01:18:48,022 --> 01:18:50,013
..but our honour back!

1333
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:51,952
Today, all of us are so happy..

1334
01:18:52,026 --> 01:18:54,995
..that we don't have
words to express it.

1335
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:57,961
If C Kkompany wouldn't
have helped us..

1336
01:18:58,032 --> 01:19:00,023
..then we would have been ruined.

1337
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:02,398
We would have been thrown
out on the roads.

1338
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:06,338
I would call them the Robinhood's
of underworld.

1339
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,203
The saviours of the poor.

1340
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:13,303
Wherever they are, our blessings
are always with them.

1341
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,975
And all the resident of Radhabai
chawl will always pray..

1342
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:18,245
..that the police may never
catch hold of them.

1343
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,915
That was Radhabai chawl's
secretary Mr. Pradahan..

1344
01:19:21,055 --> 01:19:25,151
..who's giving the title of Robinhood
to an underworld gang.

1345
01:19:25,426 --> 01:19:26,984
Ritu Sharma, along with
cameraman Jadhav..

1346
01:19:27,061 --> 01:19:28,995
..Zee News, Mumbai.

1347
01:19:30,064 --> 01:19:31,292
Josha!

1348
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:38,001
Josha, we have got back our shanty!
- Really.

1349
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:43,075
To tell you the truth,
I had lost all hopes of this place.

1350
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:46,003
If everything is fine now,
then why are you crying?

1351
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:49,683
Everyone is crying here today,
but with happiness.

1352
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,580
The Lord sees everything.
He is not blind.

1353
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:57,056
Yes, he might have had cataract
for a few days.

1354
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,399
Bhai, he had sponsored the lighting
and the party of the shanty.

1355
01:20:07,468 --> 01:20:08,628
Him, Patel.

1356
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,692
Yes, bhai.

1357
01:20:10,104 --> 01:20:11,162
Instead of sponsoring my mourning..

1358
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:14,140
..it was better that I sponsored
the party in the shanty.

1359
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:16,635
Try to understand our
problem, Dattubhai.

1360
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,269
Neither you, nor the police..

1361
01:20:18,646 --> 01:20:21,046
No one knows anything
about the C Kkompany.

1362
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,044
Now you tell me,
in such a situation..

1363
01:20:23,117 --> 01:20:26,109
..how can we expect
protection from you?

1364
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:29,054
Hey Patel! We have been
doing business together..

1365
01:20:29,123 --> 01:20:31,182
..for many years now.

1366
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,261
You made so many malls and buildings
under my protection.

1367
01:20:36,197 --> 01:20:39,598
No one dared to interfere.
- Yes.

1368
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:42,732
But just because of a small mess..

1369
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:44,066
You are right Dattubhai!

1370
01:20:44,405 --> 01:20:46,066
But all of your other properties..

1371
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:48,108
..have been acquired illegally too.

1372
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:49,599
Just think, bhai.

1373
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,336
What if the C Kkompany
interferes there too?

1374
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:56,740
And what if it is not a cracker
bomb the next time.

1375
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:01,081
That's why, Dattubhai,
we have decided..

1376
01:21:01,155 --> 01:21:07,094
..that from now onward,
we won't take any of your projects.

1377
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:11,492
If I have said anything wrong
then you can kill me.

1378
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,658
Anyways, the C Kkompany
will not spare.

1379
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:18,101
Forgive me, Dattubhai,
but these days..

1380
01:21:18,172 --> 01:21:21,733
..your terror is not the same like
it was before in this city.

1381
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:26,580
You idiot!

1382
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,341
Bhai's terror has lessened.

1383
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:31,408
Jadhav! Keep your gun under control.

1384
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:32,675
Idiot!

1385
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:36,146
They are right!

1386
01:21:37,725 --> 01:21:38,714
Just amazing!

1387
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:45,664
C Kkompany ruined a
10 year old relationship.

1388
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:58,237
Bhai, Balaji.

1389
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:01,214
She has to call up now.

1390
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,244
Hello. - Hello!

1391
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,584
Just a minute.
- Hello.

1392
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:10,221
Fatso. - Yes, bhai.

1393
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:13,156
Now that they have come,
don't let them go..

1394
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,195
..without catering to them.
- Fine, bhai.

1395
01:22:16,397 --> 01:22:17,830
Get over it, fine.

1396
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:19,161
Yes, Ms. Sakshi, tell me.

1397
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:20,530
What do I say, Dattubhai?

1398
01:22:21,235 --> 01:22:23,169
You had promised me..

1399
01:22:23,237 --> 01:22:25,831
..that it will be my face
behind the bandage.

1400
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:28,341
Yes, but why are you crying?

1401
01:22:28,409 --> 01:22:30,172
What else do I do?

1402
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:33,173
In today's episode
the bandage is being..

1403
01:22:33,247 --> 01:22:34,236
..taken off my face.

1404
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:39,343
And someone else's face
is behind it.

1405
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:42,846
Ms. Sakshi.. - Don't know
who has done this to me.

1406
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:46,291
Mr. Singhania, here is the
daughter-in-law of your family.

1407
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:54,724
Even with your influence, the
Balaji people replaced me!

1408
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:56,693
Ms. Sakshi, please don't cry!

1409
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:57,760
Please don't cry, Sakshi!

1410
01:22:58,206 --> 01:22:59,298
Let it be Dattubhai!

1411
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:03,606
Now your promise holds
no meaning to me.

1412
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,211
Bhai, forget about the C Kkompany..

1413
01:23:09,283 --> 01:23:12,878
..now even these serial companies
aren't scared of us.

1414
01:23:15,723 --> 01:23:19,591
Jadhav! Take the car out, right now!

1415
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:20,718
Right now!

1416
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:24,663
I will show what Dattu Satellite is!

1417
01:23:24,732 --> 01:23:25,721
Come on.

1418
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:38,667
Dattubhai! Dattubhai!

1419
01:23:39,847 --> 01:23:40,905
Dattubhai! Dattubhai!

1420
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:42,313
Because of you I got
the role of Ravan!

1421
01:23:42,383 --> 01:23:44,351
I don't know how to thank you.

1422
01:23:45,686 --> 01:23:48,655
Come on. Come on.

1423
01:24:02,336 --> 01:24:03,428
Dattubhai!

1424
01:24:03,971 --> 01:24:07,304
The one and only Ekta Kapoor!

1425
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:12,271
Whose serials have not only boggled
the mind of Dattu Satellite..

1426
01:24:12,346 --> 01:24:16,305
..but also the minds of
the entire country!

1427
01:24:16,617 --> 01:24:23,284
No matter what, I am the number
one fan of your serials.

1428
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,760
Otherwise I have received a thousand
complaints against you.

1429
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:31,791
The story of your serial
never goes ahead.

1430
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:37,300
In your serial, the women
sleep in Kanjivaram saris..

1431
01:24:37,371 --> 01:24:39,396
..and with full make-up.

1432
01:24:40,641 --> 01:24:42,302
Who is the mother, the sister..

1433
01:24:42,376 --> 01:24:44,401
.. the mother-in-law,
the daughter-in-law..

1434
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:45,468
You can never figure that out.

1435
01:24:45,813 --> 01:24:47,303
All of them look the same.

1436
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:51,317
The sounds of background
music in your serials..

1437
01:24:51,385 --> 01:24:53,376
..feel like a bomb explosion.

1438
01:24:53,454 --> 01:24:54,443
Seems like a war is
going on in Kargil!

1439
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:57,880
Tell me one thing.

1440
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:01,321
Why are the names of the characters
in your serials..

1441
01:25:01,395 --> 01:25:03,693
..Aryaman, Aryaveer?

1442
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:08,402
Are the names like Suresh,
Pravin, Kartik dead?

1443
01:25:09,036 --> 01:25:10,333
In the entire world,
no one must have..

1444
01:25:10,404 --> 01:25:12,668
..performed so many
plastic surgeries!

1445
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:15,565
As much as it's done
in your serials.

1446
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,336
Still, did I ever tell you anything?

1447
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:20,439
No, isn't it?
- Did I tell you anything?

1448
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:22,507
Sorry Dattubhai.

1449
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:24,949
We have to do it for the
popularity of the serial.

1450
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:28,352
Do it! Do whatever you want.

1451
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:33,418
But you will also have to
do, what I tell you to.

1452
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:38,532
I want only Sakshi's face
behind the bandage.

1453
01:25:38,599 --> 01:25:41,033
But her plastic surgery
has already been done.

1454
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:42,763
I don't know that.

1455
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:47,701
I want only Sakshi in that role.

1456
01:25:48,876 --> 01:25:51,572
If anything goes wrong..

1457
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:54,446
..then I will kill you.

1458
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:57,983
Because it is the question
of my promise.

1459
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:01,012
Understood! I'll take your leave.

1460
01:26:07,461 --> 01:26:09,395
Oh my God.

1461
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:11,687
Wait a minute!

1462
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:15,536
'Kyunki Meri Jabaan Ka Sawaal Hai!'

1463
01:26:17,471 --> 01:26:19,063
It is a nice title for my new serial.

1464
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,340
And it starts with K too.

1465
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:23,065
Whoopee!

1466
01:26:37,758 --> 01:26:43,424
I, Mahesh Bhatt, invites you
all in Bhatt Seriously.

1467
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:46,432
Who are C Kkompany?

1468
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:49,696
Rebellions or terrorists.

1469
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:51,837
That's the issue today?

1470
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:56,439
Our panellists are, Mr.
Sadashiv Pradhan!

1471
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:57,977
Secretary of Rabhabai shanty.

1472
01:26:58,579 --> 01:27:03,016
Mr. P.N. Ghadge! Ex-Commissioner
of police, Mumbai.

1473
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:07,848
And Mrs. Amedha Chaudhary!
A social activist.

1474
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:11,715
Saviour of the people.

1475
01:27:12,526 --> 01:27:14,517
Robinhood of the underworld.

1476
01:27:14,595 --> 01:27:17,462
Should you be giving such
titles to those people..

1477
01:27:17,531 --> 01:27:22,093
..who helped you by threatening
to kill other people?

1478
01:27:22,169 --> 01:27:24,535
Is it right?
- No, no, no, Bhatt sir.

1479
01:27:24,605 --> 01:27:27,472
Look, we didn't go to them
asking for help.

1480
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:29,475
We went to the police,
the government..

1481
01:27:29,543 --> 01:27:31,033
..and the social organizations.

1482
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:33,137
We requested everyone to help us.

1483
01:27:33,547 --> 01:27:35,674
But only C Kkompany heeded
to our request.

1484
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:39,481
Ghadge sir, from this,
can I derive that the common man..

1485
01:27:39,553 --> 01:27:44,957
..has lost faith in the machinery
of law and order?

1486
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:48,484
Bhatt sir, I agree that there
are loopholes in our systems.

1487
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:52,489
But.. if everyone thinks
about taking the aide..

1488
01:27:52,566 --> 01:27:54,500
..of the underworld people
like this..

1489
01:27:54,568 --> 01:27:57,560
..then, there will be
no law and order.

1490
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:00,032
Mrs. Amedha, what do you have
to say about this issue?

1491
01:28:00,107 --> 01:28:02,598
It's a complete glorification
of gangsters.

1492
01:28:02,677 --> 01:28:06,636
Getting justice to one by
being unjust to another.

1493
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:08,174
That's ridiculous.

1494
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:09,511
That's amazing!

1495
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:13,510
When some builders took the
aid of the underworld..

1496
01:28:13,587 --> 01:28:15,714
..to make us homeless..

1497
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:17,554
..then no one did anything.

1498
01:28:17,858 --> 01:28:20,520
And today, when an underworld gang..

1499
01:28:20,594 --> 01:28:24,792
..got us our houses back
which belongs to us..

1500
01:28:24,865 --> 01:28:27,527
..then we are talking about
justice and injustice.

1501
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:29,832
Amedha, this is the point.

1502
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:31,531
Wait, wait, wait, Mr. Pradhan!

1503
01:28:31,605 --> 01:28:33,698
No, no..
- There is still law!

1504
01:28:33,774 --> 01:28:36,607
Amedha! Amedha! One minute please.

1505
01:28:36,677 --> 01:28:37,735
There is someone in the audience..

1506
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:38,904
..that wants to ask a question.
One minute!

1507
01:28:39,613 --> 01:28:40,602
Tell me.

1508
01:28:40,881 --> 01:28:42,542
I think, the ones who
plant explosives..

1509
01:28:42,616 --> 01:28:44,914
..in the trains and buses,
they are called terrorists.

1510
01:28:44,985 --> 01:28:46,976
Those who help people
cannot be terrorists!

1511
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:51,947
Ghadge sir.

1512
01:28:52,793 --> 01:28:54,556
I don't believe this.

1513
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:56,556
Just because C Kkompany
helped someone..

1514
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:59,064
..people are considering
them great men.

1515
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:03,128
But in the eyes of the law,
they are nothing but criminals!

1516
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:05,562
No, no, no that depends
on your point of view..

1517
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:07,971
..to see this issue.

1518
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:11,575
The battle that Bhagat Singh
and Rajguru fought..

1519
01:29:11,645 --> 01:29:13,636
..it was called terrorism
by the British.

1520
01:29:14,014 --> 01:29:17,973
But for the lndians, they
were great revolutionaries.

1521
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:21,649
For us, C Kkompany are
revolutionaries.

1522
01:29:21,722 --> 01:29:22,711
And they always will be.

1523
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:26,585
And this is not just me, but
the voice of 150 tenants!

1524
01:29:30,731 --> 01:29:32,756
Well, it's time for a short break.

1525
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:35,165
We will be back after the break.

1526
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:37,628
We will continue discussing
on the issues like this.

1527
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:40,004
Bhatt Seriously.

1528
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:43,600
We gave the breaking news
about C Kkompany.

1529
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:49,648
But as you can see, the other
news channels encashed on it.

1530
01:29:50,017 --> 01:29:54,784
We have thought about such
a show for our channel.

1531
01:29:54,855 --> 01:29:58,291
This will be the biggest
reality show till date.

1532
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:02,259
In this show, the common public
will express their problems.

1533
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:06,095
And then we will see, who
will solve these problems.

1534
01:30:07,268 --> 01:30:11,637
The government or the C Kkompany.

1535
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:15,040
For the first time, it will happen
that.. - Excuse me, sir.

1536
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:16,167
Yes!

1537
01:30:16,243 --> 01:30:17,733
Such a reality show,
is it possible?

1538
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:20,303
The matter seems
a bit controversial.

1539
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:22,076
Yes sir, it seems
very controversial.

1540
01:30:22,149 --> 01:30:25,312
Then, let it be. Why do people
these days see news channels?

1541
01:30:25,986 --> 01:30:27,817
For the news! No!

1542
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:29,651
Our stories are more sensible..

1543
01:30:29,723 --> 01:30:32,658
..than the T.V serials these days.

1544
01:30:32,993 --> 01:30:33,982
That's why they watch it.

1545
01:30:35,095 --> 01:30:37,120
But sir, who will anchor
this programme.

1546
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:39,800
The star reporter of
our news channel.

1547
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:41,327
Who else?

1548
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:42,994
Congrats, brother!
- Congratulations.

1549
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:44,332
Congratulations!
- Thank you! Thank you!

1550
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:45,736
So ladies and gentlemen!

1551
01:30:45,806 --> 01:30:48,798
Let's get started on the show
that will rock the nation.

1552
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:51,677
As you can see, this show
that's going to start..

1553
01:30:51,745 --> 01:30:54,737
..on Zee news is being publicised
quite vastly.

1554
01:30:54,815 --> 01:30:57,682
And it is being said, that this
show that will start soon..

1555
01:30:57,751 --> 01:30:59,742
..is the biggest reality
show till date.

1556
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:01,685
But the question that's
being asked is that..

1557
01:31:01,755 --> 01:31:03,689
..how right is it to involve
the underworld..

1558
01:31:03,757 --> 01:31:06,317
..in solving the problems
of the common man?

1559
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,694
Especially, when the government..

1560
01:31:08,762 --> 01:31:09,820
..is being challenged too.

1561
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:11,364
But no matter what one says..

1562
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:13,764
This has become a very hot topic
amongst the common people.

1563
01:31:13,834 --> 01:31:15,324
The underworld will help the people.

1564
01:31:15,402 --> 01:31:18,098
What? The bhai's will solve the
problems of the common man.

1565
01:31:18,172 --> 01:31:20,140
Anything can happen
in this country.

1566
01:31:20,407 --> 01:31:22,170
The government versus
the C Kkompany.

1567
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:23,301
That's a cool idea.

1568
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:25,174
It's better than the daily soaps.

1569
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:26,338
We will watch it.

1570
01:31:26,413 --> 01:31:27,778
We will surely watch it.
- We will watch it.

1571
01:31:27,848 --> 01:31:29,042
We will surely watch it.

1572
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:42,895
You will become world
famous in Mumbai.

1573
01:31:42,963 --> 01:31:45,955
The channel people are spending
a lot, hoping on us.

1574
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:49,192
Everything will be a waste, dude.
- Oh God!

1575
01:31:49,803 --> 01:31:50,963
We will not do anything.

1576
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:52,905
The government will do whatever
needs to be done.

1577
01:31:53,874 --> 01:31:55,273
Pushottam is paying us, isn't it?

1578
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:57,208
I am happy with us.

1579
01:31:58,112 --> 01:32:00,740
This 'Sarkar Ya C Kkompany'
will be the biggest flop.

1580
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:12,283
Welcome to the first episode
of Sakar Ya C Kkompany.

1581
01:32:12,993 --> 01:32:15,757
I am Akshay Kumar, welcoming you..

1582
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:17,956
..to the biggest reality show, ever.

1583
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:20,366
Everyone wants justice.

1584
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:23,767
But the common man gets so fed up..

1585
01:32:23,837 --> 01:32:27,773
..of going to the police and
the court every time..

1586
01:32:27,841 --> 01:32:30,833
..that he loses faith in justice.

1587
01:32:30,911 --> 01:32:32,173
Just one call from you.

1588
01:32:32,246 --> 01:32:35,443
And we will question
Sarkar or C Kkompany.

1589
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:37,782
The government that has
been selected by you..

1590
01:32:37,851 --> 01:32:39,785
..or the one's whom you
have given the title..

1591
01:32:39,853 --> 01:32:41,445
..of Robinhoods of the underworld.

1592
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:46,451
Now we have to watch, who will
pass this test of justice.

1593
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:49,788
Our first complainant
on this show is..

1594
01:32:49,863 --> 01:32:53,230
..Mrs. Asha Trivedi! From
Mumbai, Maharashtra!

1595
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:54,790
Greetings, Mrs. Asha.

1596
01:32:55,402 --> 01:32:56,460
Greetings.

1597
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:58,471
Welcome to the show
Sakar Ya C Kkompany!

1598
01:32:59,173 --> 01:33:01,073
Tell me, what is your problem?

1599
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:03,810
My husband Sushil Trivedi..

1600
01:33:03,877 --> 01:33:06,209
..was the head clerk in
the railway head office.

1601
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:10,045
He died in the bomb explosion
in the train!

1602
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:11,812
But the compensation that
the government had promised..

1603
01:33:11,885 --> 01:33:14,410
..we still haven't received it.

1604
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:16,922
Why didn't you get it?
What was the reason given to you?

1605
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:19,824
The officer present
there said that..

1606
01:33:19,893 --> 01:33:22,885
..the bomb blast took place at 5:45!

1607
01:33:22,963 --> 01:33:25,488
And my husband's duty
ends at 6 o'clock!

1608
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:29,098
So, how can a government officer
leave before time?

1609
01:33:29,169 --> 01:33:32,036
And by saying this, he refused
to give the compensation!

1610
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,835
We were supposed to receive
the provident fund..

1611
01:33:33,907 --> 01:33:34,896
..but he has stopped that too.

1612
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:36,838
Now, after his death,
I will have to..

1613
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:38,969
..vacate the railway quarters too.

1614
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:41,838
You tell me, such big punishment..

1615
01:33:41,915 --> 01:33:43,906
..for leaving 15 minutes earlier.

1616
01:33:45,252 --> 01:33:48,312
I have a child! Where can I go?

1617
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:53,519
I don't have any means
of earning or any aide.

1618
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:56,860
And then, I have been
wandering around..

1619
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:59,421
..the government office,
but in vain.

1620
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:03,233
The government didn't do anything.

1621
01:34:04,038 --> 01:34:06,871
I hope the C Kkompany
does something.

1622
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,472
I felt that
our problems are so big.

1623
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:17,407
But it is nothing compared
to hers, dude.

1624
01:34:19,953 --> 01:34:21,443
God knows if anything
happens or not.

1625
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:24,890
But shall we try once.
- Yes.

1626
01:34:25,926 --> 01:34:27,894
If our single phone call
can benefit someone..

1627
01:34:27,961 --> 01:34:31,226
..then I feel, we should try it.
- You are right, dude.

1628
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:33,266
And we don't have to rob
anyone at gunpoint.

1629
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:35,266
We just have to make a phone call.

1630
01:34:36,036 --> 01:34:39,494
But dude, this time
we won't call from the PCO.

1631
01:34:39,573 --> 01:34:42,474
We won't call from the PCO. Never!

1632
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:46,003
Untraceable number!
- Yes, untraceable number.

1633
01:34:46,613 --> 01:34:48,911
If we call using this,
then no one will be able..

1634
01:34:48,982 --> 01:34:50,916
..to trace who is calling
and from where.

1635
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:53,978
Give it here.

1636
01:34:54,054 --> 01:34:56,022
All the real bhai's
(Don) use this card.

1637
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:59,916
So we will call like real
bhai's using this.

1638
01:34:59,993 --> 01:35:02,188
Hello brother, remember
one thing clearly!

1639
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:04,494
If our work gets done by this
phone call, then it's fine.

1640
01:35:04,565 --> 01:35:06,430
Otherwise this C Kkompany
will close down.

1641
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,331
Load the card! Load it.

1642
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:09,460
Dude, give the card!

1643
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:19,445
Hello, Western Railway Compensation
Department!

1644
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:21,071
I am speaking from the C Kkompany!

1645
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:23,605
C Kkompany!

1646
01:35:24,952 --> 01:35:25,941
Listen carefully.

1647
01:35:26,286 --> 01:35:28,948
If within 48 hours Asha
Trivedi doesn't receive..

1648
01:35:29,022 --> 01:35:31,957
..her cheque from the
railway relief fund..

1649
01:35:32,025 --> 01:35:34,960
..and her husband's provident fund..

1650
01:35:35,028 --> 01:35:37,963
..then you will have
to go up, to ask..

1651
01:35:38,031 --> 01:35:42,297
..why her husband left 15 minutes
earlier from the office.

1652
01:35:44,438 --> 01:35:45,962
You are very punctual, isn't it?

1653
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,398
So, note it down.

1654
01:35:47,474 --> 01:35:49,339
Your time starts now.

1655
01:35:52,646 --> 01:35:53,977
Mr. Upadhay.
- Yes.

1656
01:35:54,047 --> 01:35:55,639
Bring Sushil Trivedi's file.
- Yes sir.

1657
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:57,314
C Kompany.

1658
01:35:57,584 --> 01:36:00,519
Mrs. Trivedi, how do you feel now
that you have got your right?

1659
01:36:02,322 --> 01:36:04,984
I want to say that,
what the government..

1660
01:36:05,058 --> 01:36:08,516
..couldn't do in 2 years,
C Kkompany did it in 2 days.

1661
01:36:08,595 --> 01:36:11,996
And because of them, I received
not only the provident fund..

1662
01:36:12,065 --> 01:36:13,999
..and the money but I was
also offered a job..

1663
01:36:14,067 --> 01:36:17,002
..in the railways in the
place of my husband.

1664
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:20,005
Whether anyone calls C Kkompany..

1665
01:36:20,073 --> 01:36:22,166
..criminal or goons, anything.

1666
01:36:23,076 --> 01:36:24,236
But for me, they are my God!

1667
01:36:24,645 --> 01:36:25,634
Really.

1668
01:36:27,347 --> 01:36:28,473
Thank you, C Kkompany!

1669
01:36:30,083 --> 01:36:31,072
Thanks.

1670
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:33,575
It's rightly said!

1671
01:36:34,354 --> 01:36:38,256
We might not be strong but
we aren't cowards either!

1672
01:36:39,092 --> 01:36:42,118
"The entire world will
bow in front of us!"

1673
01:36:42,196 --> 01:36:44,687
"Everyone will bow to us."

1674
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:47,427
"Everything will be
under our control!"

1675
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:50,368
"That's the power of the phone."

1676
01:37:00,647 --> 01:37:02,376
Long live C Kkompany!

1677
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:04,246
Long live! Long live!

1678
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:05,307
C Kkompany!

1679
01:37:59,306 --> 01:38:02,173
"Everyone will bow to us."

1680
01:38:02,242 --> 01:38:04,506
"Everything will be
under our control!"

1681
01:38:04,578 --> 01:38:08,173
C Kkompany! C Kkompany!
C Kkompany!

1682
01:38:08,248 --> 01:38:10,182
Purshottam is troubling you so much.

1683
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:13,151
Why don't you let C Kkompany
know about it?

1684
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,112
Your problem will be solved.

1685
01:38:20,827 --> 01:38:22,795
"That's the power of the phone."

1686
01:38:22,863 --> 01:38:24,194
C Kkompany!

1687
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:35,301
"The speaker is blaring!"

1688
01:38:35,375 --> 01:38:37,605
"The speaker is blaring!"

1689
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:39,771
"The speaker is blaring!"

1690
01:38:39,846 --> 01:38:42,144
"The speaker is blaring!"

1691
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:44,346
"These troublesome boys."

1692
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:46,477
"They create a commotion."

1693
01:38:47,154 --> 01:38:49,816
"These troublesome boys."

1694
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:51,152
"They create a commotion."

1695
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,150
"These troublesome boys."

1696
01:38:54,227 --> 01:38:56,218
"They create a commotion."

1697
01:38:56,296 --> 01:38:58,230
"Sometimes they go to the disco."

1698
01:38:58,298 --> 01:39:00,664
"Sometimes they fight
when they are drunk."

1699
01:39:00,734 --> 01:39:04,170
"The rogue boys, the speaker
is blaring so late at night!"

1700
01:39:04,237 --> 01:39:08,173
"The rogue boys, the speaker
is blaring so late at night!"

1701
01:39:08,241 --> 01:39:09,299
"The rogue boys.."

1702
01:39:09,776 --> 01:39:11,175
"The speaker is blaring!"

1703
01:39:11,244 --> 01:39:13,235
"The speaker is blaring!"

1704
01:39:13,313 --> 01:39:15,372
"The speaker is blaring!"

1705
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:17,576
"The speaker is blaring!"

1706
01:39:26,526 --> 01:39:28,721
"The speaker is blaring!"

1707
01:39:28,795 --> 01:39:30,854
"The speaker is blaring!"

1708
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:32,256
"Love.."

1709
01:39:32,332 --> 01:39:34,266
"They play the game of love."

1710
01:39:34,334 --> 01:39:36,325
"Flirt with everyone."

1711
01:39:36,403 --> 01:39:38,200
"Wherever they fall in love."

1712
01:39:38,271 --> 01:39:40,671
"They never look at her again."

1713
01:39:40,741 --> 01:39:42,470
"Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!"

1714
01:39:45,278 --> 01:39:47,542
"The play the game of love."

1715
01:39:47,614 --> 01:39:49,605
"Flirt with everyone."

1716
01:39:49,683 --> 01:39:51,207
"Wherever they fall in love."

1717
01:39:51,284 --> 01:39:53,878
"They never look at her again."

1718
01:39:54,221 --> 01:39:56,212
"Sometimes they stare!"

1719
01:39:56,289 --> 01:39:58,257
"And sometimes they smile."

1720
01:39:58,558 --> 01:40:00,389
"Sometimes they go to the disco."

1721
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:02,360
"Sometimes they fight
when they are drunk."

1722
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:05,728
"The rogue boys, the speaker
is blaring so late at night!"

1723
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:09,235
"The rogue boys, the speaker
is blaring so late at night!"

1724
01:40:09,302 --> 01:40:11,429
"The rogue boys.."

1725
01:40:11,772 --> 01:40:18,234
"Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!"

1726
01:40:38,331 --> 01:40:40,765
"Hey bartender, hey bartender!"

1727
01:40:40,834 --> 01:40:42,859
"Give me a glass more."

1728
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:45,268
"30 millilitres, 60 millilitres!"

1729
01:40:45,338 --> 01:40:47,397
"Stop measuring!"

1730
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:51,934
"Guys always shout.
They ask and they get more."

1731
01:40:52,012 --> 01:40:54,276
"Hey bartender, hey bartender!"

1732
01:40:54,347 --> 01:40:56,406
"Give me a glass more."

1733
01:40:56,483 --> 01:40:58,815
"30 millilitres, 60 millilitres!"

1734
01:40:58,885 --> 01:41:00,750
"Stop measuring!"

1735
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:02,812
"They are not scared of anything."

1736
01:41:02,889 --> 01:41:04,948
"Don't measure the drink."

1737
01:41:05,358 --> 01:41:07,292
"Sometimes they go to the disco."

1738
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,351
"Sometimes they fight
when they are drunk."

1739
01:41:09,429 --> 01:41:12,489
"The rogue boys, the speaker
is blaring so late at night!"

1740
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:15,797
"The rogue boys, the speaker
is blaring so late at night!"

1741
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:18,360
"The rogue boys.."

1742
01:41:18,438 --> 01:41:22,898
"Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!"

1743
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:24,637
"These troublesome boys."

1744
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:26,508
"They create a commotion."

1745
01:41:27,347 --> 01:41:28,974
"These troublesome boys."

1746
01:41:29,049 --> 01:41:31,381
"They create a commotion."

1747
01:41:31,451 --> 01:41:34,318
"These troublesome boys."

1748
01:41:34,387 --> 01:41:36,378
"They create a commotion."

1749
01:41:36,456 --> 01:41:38,321
"Sometimes they go to the disco."

1750
01:41:38,391 --> 01:41:40,484
"Sometimes they fight
when they are drunk."

1751
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,326
"The rogue boys, the speaker
is blaring so late at night!"

1752
01:41:44,397 --> 01:41:47,332
"The rogue boys, the speaker is
blaring so late at night!"

1753
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,459
"The rogue boys.."

1754
01:41:49,536 --> 01:41:52,664
"The speaker is blaring!"

1755
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:55,606
"The speaker is blaring!"

1756
01:42:00,647 --> 01:42:02,342
As you can see, the popularity
of C Kkompany..

1757
01:42:02,415 --> 01:42:04,508
..has reached the sky.

1758
01:42:04,584 --> 01:42:06,347
According to a survey, we found
out that the popularity..

1759
01:42:06,419 --> 01:42:08,353
..of C Kkompany is more than..

1760
01:42:08,421 --> 01:42:10,548
..Amitabh Bachchan and
Sachin Tendulkar.

1761
01:42:10,624 --> 01:42:12,489
How do the members of
C Kkompany look?

1762
01:42:12,559 --> 01:42:14,356
There is a painting
competition held..

1763
01:42:14,427 --> 01:42:15,894
..on this issue too.

1764
01:42:15,962 --> 01:42:17,429
Bhai, the union leader has come.

1765
01:42:17,497 --> 01:42:21,365
With cameraman Ashok Kumar,
I am Saloni Singh, Zee News, Mumbai.

1766
01:42:22,569 --> 01:42:24,503
Bhai, these three people.

1767
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:26,700
Chaubey! He is the leader..

1768
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:27,933
..of the taxi association! Greet him.

1769
01:42:28,008 --> 01:42:28,997
Greetings, bhai!

1770
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:32,469
Bhai, this is Patil! The leader of
the Dabba association (Lunch box).

1771
01:42:32,546 --> 01:42:33,979
Greet him!
- Greetings, bhai.

1772
01:42:36,383 --> 01:42:37,441
Bhai, this is Manglabai.

1773
01:42:37,517 --> 01:42:38,882
She is the leader of the
maid's association.

1774
01:42:38,952 --> 01:42:40,476
Greet..
- Greetings, bhai.

1775
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:41,851
Have you explained them everything?

1776
01:42:41,922 --> 01:42:43,981
Yes, bhai! Yes!

1777
01:42:44,057 --> 01:42:45,888
Everyone inform your members.

1778
01:42:45,959 --> 01:42:47,449
And keep your eyes and ears open.

1779
01:42:47,527 --> 01:42:50,394
If you get any news
about C Kkompany..

1780
01:42:50,463 --> 01:42:52,863
..quickly inform me about it.

1781
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,458
Come on, leave!

1782
01:42:54,534 --> 01:42:55,592
Come on
- Okay, bhai!

1783
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:57,068
That's enough! Come on.

1784
01:43:00,407 --> 01:43:01,965
Bhai, I can't understand one thing.

1785
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:04,010
We have such good informers.

1786
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:05,510
But no one could give us any
news about C Kkompany.

1787
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:09,413
How will these three unknown
people get you information?

1788
01:43:09,482 --> 01:43:12,417
Jadav! These three
are the informers..

1789
01:43:12,485 --> 01:43:14,419
..that dwell amongst
the common people.

1790
01:43:15,422 --> 01:43:18,414
And only these three can
give the information..

1791
01:43:18,491 --> 01:43:20,755
..about C Kkompany of
the common people.

1792
01:43:21,428 --> 01:43:23,020
Come on, read the newspaper.

1793
01:43:26,766 --> 01:43:30,827
Today, C Kkompany..
- Read something else.

1794
01:43:33,473 --> 01:43:38,433
Bhai, three actor's of Balaji
in coma for not getting sleep.

1795
01:43:39,779 --> 01:43:41,440
Keep Balaji's phone on silent.

1796
01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:47,449
It's right that love cannot
be bought with money.

1797
01:43:48,455 --> 01:43:49,979
But it is very expensive.

1798
01:43:50,056 --> 01:43:52,752
He is the same guy that hosts
Sarkar Ya C Kkompany?

1799
01:43:52,826 --> 01:43:53,884
Yes, he is the one.

1800
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:54,949
Hi.
- Hi!

1801
01:43:58,498 --> 01:43:59,931
You have become a celebrity.

1802
01:44:01,635 --> 01:44:03,466
By the way, brother is very
tensed these days..

1803
01:44:03,536 --> 01:44:04,594
..because of C Kkompany.

1804
01:44:05,105 --> 01:44:07,573
Really! - Yes, he doesn't
care about anything else.

1805
01:44:09,009 --> 01:44:10,067
That's good in a way!

1806
01:44:11,611 --> 01:44:13,476
It will be easier for us to elope.

1807
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,145
The visas for Dubai
will arrive tomorrow.

1808
01:44:16,549 --> 01:44:19,074
You give me the money, I will
book the flight ticket.

1809
01:44:19,619 --> 01:44:21,484
The sooner we book the ticket..

1810
01:44:21,554 --> 01:44:22,543
..the more discount we will get.

1811
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:28,550
But Priya.. I was just going to
tell you that.. the money..

1812
01:44:28,628 --> 01:44:30,562
Now, don't tell me that you are
not getting the money, okay.

1813
01:44:30,630 --> 01:44:31,927
We are getting the money!

1814
01:44:31,998 --> 01:44:33,488
Trust me! We are getting the money!

1815
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:35,130
But there is just one problem.

1816
01:44:35,635 --> 01:44:37,159
I will get the money on the 29th!

1817
01:44:38,171 --> 01:44:39,536
You must be kidding.

1818
01:44:39,906 --> 01:44:41,498
You mean to say, you are
getting the money..

1819
01:44:41,574 --> 01:44:42,632
..one day before the marriage!

1820
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:44,540
Still, we get one day.

1821
01:44:44,944 --> 01:44:46,741
People elope
from the marriage dais!

1822
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:48,940
You think you are
Prithviraj Chauhan?

1823
01:44:49,549 --> 01:44:52,017
Just remember, if you don't
get the money on the 29th..

1824
01:44:52,085 --> 01:44:53,677
..then it's over.

1825
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:55,817
This is our last chance.

1826
01:44:59,592 --> 01:45:00,581
Excuse me, sir!

1827
01:45:01,027 --> 01:45:02,961
Sir, we have a problem too, sir.

1828
01:45:03,029 --> 01:45:05,623
But.. - Sir, your phone lines
are very busy.

1829
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:06,791
Yes sir!
- So sir..

1830
01:45:06,866 --> 01:45:08,527
If you can air our problems
on the show..

1831
01:45:08,902 --> 01:45:12,099
Not just yours, now I will have
to air my problem in the show.

1832
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:16,207
Sir, I am Shrikant Sharma
from Kalbadevi!

1833
01:45:16,276 --> 01:45:18,744
Sir, actually ours is
a residential area.

1834
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:21,007
And for the past few years,
a club has opened up here.

1835
01:45:21,548 --> 01:45:22,606
There is a lot of problem here.

1836
01:45:22,682 --> 01:45:24,650
And the serenity here is lost.

1837
01:45:24,718 --> 01:45:26,879
And we are scared of the goons, sir.

1838
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:29,748
We are scared to take up
this matter with anyone.

1839
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:33,520
We have developed some courage
because of C Kkompany.

1840
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,554
We request that,
C Kkompany helps us..

1841
01:45:36,629 --> 01:45:39,564
..and shuts down this club.

1842
01:45:42,969 --> 01:45:44,994
Bhai, he is talking about
shutting down our club.

1843
01:45:47,707 --> 01:45:50,232
Now they will know about
their right place.

1844
01:45:52,612 --> 01:45:54,910
Keep our boys ready.
- Yes bhai.

1845
01:45:55,882 --> 01:45:58,578
Now just threatening on
the phone won't do.

1846
01:45:59,919 --> 01:46:02,046
Let's do just like we had decided.

1847
01:46:02,589 --> 01:46:04,580
The time has come to
shutdown C Kkompany.

1848
01:46:05,658 --> 01:46:06,647
It's over!

1849
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:13,121
Yes, seems like I am retiring
for the second time in life.

1850
01:46:14,667 --> 01:46:17,602
Dude, good that we are just
retiring from work..

1851
01:46:17,670 --> 01:46:19,638
..otherwise we would have
been retired from life.

1852
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:25,803
Come on, for some time..
I helped the people.

1853
01:46:27,347 --> 01:46:31,249
At least, it was better than
feeding seeds to the pigeons.

1854
01:46:35,922 --> 01:46:38,152
Lambodhar! Hello.

1855
01:46:38,224 --> 01:46:40,192
Yes, Akki!
- Where are you?

1856
01:46:40,693 --> 01:46:41,887
We are waiting for you here.

1857
01:46:42,295 --> 01:46:45,958
I am sitting in the art of
living class! - What? Bar!

1858
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:48,227
Yes! And listen carefully!

1859
01:46:48,802 --> 01:46:51,635
I called up Dattubhai and
explained him lovingly..

1860
01:46:51,704 --> 01:46:53,797
..to close down your club.

1861
01:46:54,207 --> 01:46:56,232
But he didn't understand that.

1862
01:46:56,810 --> 01:46:58,744
That's why.. just a minute.

1863
01:46:58,812 --> 01:46:59,801
Hello!

1864
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:01,771
Listen.
- Yes sir.

1865
01:47:02,882 --> 01:47:05,180
Do you have any problem?
- No sir.

1866
01:47:05,251 --> 01:47:06,980
No, no, if you do have a problem,
then let me know. - No no.

1867
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:11,183
Because, you don't know.. who I am.
- Yes sir.

1868
01:47:13,159 --> 01:47:14,820
Yes Akki!
- Yes, brother!

1869
01:47:14,894 --> 01:47:17,886
Seems like threatening on
phone won't do any good.

1870
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:20,733
That's why, we will have
to go personally.

1871
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,199
Don't do anything like that.

1872
01:47:22,268 --> 01:47:28,332
Tonight at 11 o'clock, I am going
to ruin Dattu Satellite's club.

1873
01:47:28,408 --> 01:47:30,171
Listen! Hello!

1874
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,769
What happened?

1875
01:47:35,748 --> 01:47:37,807
This madman called Dattu Satellite
and threatened him.

1876
01:47:37,884 --> 01:47:38,942
What?

1877
01:47:39,018 --> 01:47:41,077
Tonight at 1 1 o'clock, he is
going to shutdown his club.

1878
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:42,143
Oh God!

1879
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:45,157
Dude, now we have had it.

1880
01:47:46,192 --> 01:47:49,753
This C Kkompany is going
to be our end!

1881
01:47:49,829 --> 01:47:50,818
What are you saying?

1882
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,327
They can come any moment?

1883
01:47:56,035 --> 01:47:57,297
Be ready!

1884
01:47:57,370 --> 01:47:58,894
Are you ready?
- Yes, bhai!

1885
01:47:59,706 --> 01:48:01,173
And you?
- I am ready, bhai.

1886
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:05,368
Where are you going? Who are you?

1887
01:48:05,445 --> 01:48:09,313
I explained to you on the
phone to shutdown the club.

1888
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:11,278
You didn't understand.

1889
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,311
That's why I have come
myself with the lock.

1890
01:48:15,455 --> 01:48:17,650
Here. Lock it!

1891
01:48:18,024 --> 01:48:19,719
Here. Lock it!

1892
01:48:19,792 --> 01:48:20,850
Come on, lock it.

1893
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:24,761
Who are you? Who are you?

1894
01:48:28,735 --> 01:48:29,759
C Kkompany!

1895
01:48:34,307 --> 01:48:36,741
C Kkompany! You!

1896
01:48:38,778 --> 01:48:41,747
Just take a look at yourself.

1897
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:45,278
C Kkompany!

1898
01:48:49,756 --> 01:48:51,747
You don't even know the spelling..

1899
01:48:51,824 --> 01:48:53,121
..and you are C Kkompany!

1900
01:48:53,192 --> 01:48:54,352
Tell me, who are you?

1901
01:48:55,762 --> 01:48:57,024
Tell me or else I will slap you.

1902
01:48:57,096 --> 01:48:58,757
How many will you kill?

1903
01:48:58,831 --> 01:48:59,957
I am C Kkompany too!

1904
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:05,765
I am C Kkompany too!

1905
01:49:06,172 --> 01:49:07,230
We were only three!

1906
01:49:08,508 --> 01:49:09,873
When did they join?

1907
01:49:12,946 --> 01:49:14,106
Who are these people?

1908
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:15,977
Draw your guns!
- Yes, bhai.

1909
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:17,073
Hey, you go and inform bhai.

1910
01:49:20,186 --> 01:49:21,847
Dattubhai! Dattubhai!

1911
01:49:23,523 --> 01:49:25,923
The C Kkompany people have arrived!

1912
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,857
That's it!

1913
01:49:29,862 --> 01:49:31,921
Are you all ready?
- We are ready.

1914
01:49:33,399 --> 01:49:34,457
How many are they?

1915
01:49:34,534 --> 01:49:37,799
Bhai, come and see for yourself.

1916
01:49:54,887 --> 01:49:56,946
Close down Dattu's club!

1917
01:49:57,023 --> 01:49:58,957
Close it down! Close it down!

1918
01:49:59,025 --> 01:50:00,890
Close down Dattu's club!

1919
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,894
Close it down! Close it down!

1920
01:50:02,962 --> 01:50:04,827
Close down Dattu's club!

1921
01:50:04,897 --> 01:50:06,364
Close it down! Close it down!

1922
01:50:06,432 --> 01:50:08,366
Close down Dattu's club!

1923
01:50:08,434 --> 01:50:09,833
Close it down! Close it down!

1924
01:50:09,902 --> 01:50:12,302
C Kkompany, move ahead!
- We are with you!

1925
01:50:12,372 --> 01:50:14,363
C Kkompany, move ahead!
- We are with you!

1926
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,839
I didn't know that if we call
in the name of C Kkompany..

1927
01:50:15,908 --> 01:50:18,433
..so soon so many people
will come out here.

1928
01:50:18,511 --> 01:50:22,311
C Kkompany, move ahead!
- We are with you!

1929
01:50:22,382 --> 01:50:23,849
It's good that I used my
brain at the right time..

1930
01:50:23,916 --> 01:50:25,907
..or else the three of us
would have died by now.

1931
01:50:25,985 --> 01:50:28,920
Akki, they are common people like us.

1932
01:50:28,988 --> 01:50:30,853
If you do a favour on them once..

1933
01:50:30,923 --> 01:50:32,185
..they will never forget
it all their life.

1934
01:50:32,258 --> 01:50:33,987
Close down Dattu's club!

1935
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:35,357
Close it down! Close it down!

1936
01:50:35,428 --> 01:50:36,861
Close down Dattu's club!

1937
01:50:36,929 --> 01:50:38,863
Close it down! Close it down!

1938
01:50:38,931 --> 01:50:39,989
There is Lambodhar!

1939
01:50:40,066 --> 01:50:41,863
Close it down! Close it down!

1940
01:50:41,934 --> 01:50:43,868
You wait here, I will go get him!

1941
01:50:43,936 --> 01:50:45,870
Close down Dattu's club!

1942
01:50:45,938 --> 01:50:47,872
Close it down! Close it down!

1943
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,373
Lambodhar!

1944
01:50:49,442 --> 01:50:51,933
Close down Dattu's club!

1945
01:50:52,011 --> 01:50:53,376
Close it down! Close it down!

1946
01:50:53,446 --> 01:50:54,970
Close down Dattu's club!

1947
01:50:55,048 --> 01:50:56,879
Close it down! Close it down!

1948
01:50:56,949 --> 01:50:58,940
Close it down! Close it down!

1949
01:50:59,018 --> 01:51:00,076
Just a minute!

1950
01:51:00,153 --> 01:51:02,951
Lambodhar! Do you want
to get us killed!

1951
01:51:03,022 --> 01:51:04,080
Let's go from here.

1952
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:05,215
Close down Dattu's club!

1953
01:51:05,291 --> 01:51:06,883
Close it down! Close it down!

1954
01:51:06,959 --> 01:51:08,893
Close down Dattu's club!

1955
01:51:08,961 --> 01:51:10,895
Close it down! Close it down!

1956
01:51:10,963 --> 01:51:12,555
Close down Dattu's club!

1957
01:51:12,632 --> 01:51:14,429
Close it down! Close it down!

1958
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:18,061
Close it down! Close it down!

1959
01:51:19,405 --> 01:51:22,841
The opposition party members
created a chaos in the..

1960
01:51:22,975 --> 01:51:25,375
..parliament regarding the
controversial show..

1961
01:51:25,445 --> 01:51:26,969
..Sarkar Ya C Kkompany!

1962
01:51:27,046 --> 01:51:29,913
They criticised the
government and said..

1963
01:51:29,982 --> 01:51:31,916
..that they should resign,
because today..

1964
01:51:31,984 --> 01:51:35,385
..an underworld gang has become
the leader of the public.

1965
01:51:35,922 --> 01:51:37,913
As their responsibilities is being
handled an underworld gang

1966
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:39,924
is being handled by C Kkompany.

1967
01:51:40,526 --> 01:51:43,256
See! You were asking me
to go to the police.

1968
01:51:44,263 --> 01:51:45,992
The matter has reached
the parliament.

1969
01:51:46,599 --> 01:51:50,467
The police still don't know who
are behind the C Kkompany.

1970
01:51:52,672 --> 01:51:54,936
Good that we quickly agreed
to give the money.

1971
01:51:55,007 --> 01:51:56,941
Yes.
- Once we give it on the 12th..

1972
01:51:57,009 --> 01:51:59,477
..then this tension will be over.

1973
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:03,040
Good that we told Dattubhai
everything.

1974
01:52:03,116 --> 01:52:04,174
Then what?

1975
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:05,615
Who wants to get involved
in this mess?

1976
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:13,959
Dattubhai, such a serious
thing has happened..

1977
01:52:14,026 --> 01:52:15,493
..and you are watching
a T.V serial!

1978
01:52:16,162 --> 01:52:17,186
Sit! Sit! Sit!

1979
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:19,623
Bhai (Don), I just met
the Commissioner!

1980
01:52:20,299 --> 01:52:21,960
If we don't find out
the C Kkompany..

1981
01:52:22,034 --> 01:52:23,558
..then he will transfer me.

1982
01:52:25,071 --> 01:52:26,936
There will be a transfer, Chawle!

1983
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:28,971
There will be a transfer!

1984
01:52:30,643 --> 01:52:34,306
But not you, the C Kkompany!

1985
01:52:34,714 --> 01:52:36,443
Directly up there.

1986
01:52:37,617 --> 01:52:39,312
So.. have you found
the C Kkompany out?

1987
01:52:40,987 --> 01:52:44,980
Chawle.. there is a builder..

1988
01:52:45,057 --> 01:52:48,959
..his name is Pushottam Joshi!

1989
01:52:49,996 --> 01:52:53,989
They are going to extort 1 crore
from him on this 29th!

1990
01:52:55,601 --> 01:52:58,661
Is the information correct?
- Absolutely.

1991
01:53:00,606 --> 01:53:04,064
Opportunity knocks only once.

1992
01:53:04,143 --> 01:53:06,236
This time kill them.

1993
01:53:07,747 --> 01:53:11,183
You don't worry, this time
I won't spare them.

1994
01:53:12,218 --> 01:53:13,207
That's it.

1995
01:53:19,358 --> 01:53:21,223
I don't believe this!

1996
01:53:23,596 --> 01:53:26,997
You, uncle Joshi and Lambodhar
are C Kkompany!

1997
01:53:29,535 --> 01:53:31,025
The ones whom the entire country
is singing praises of..

1998
01:53:31,103 --> 01:53:33,094
..that's all of you!

1999
01:53:33,172 --> 01:53:34,161
You three.

2000
01:53:39,712 --> 01:53:41,236
I never wanted to tell you this.

2001
01:53:42,748 --> 01:53:45,046
But, no one knows what
will happen tomorrow.

2002
01:53:46,652 --> 01:53:48,017
Whether we will get the money or not.

2003
01:53:51,057 --> 01:53:53,651
Just remember, I tried.

2004
01:53:53,726 --> 01:53:54,715
I really tried.

2005
01:53:59,098 --> 01:54:00,087
I am not a coward.

2006
01:54:02,235 --> 01:54:05,033
You were saying that, brother and
Chawle sir will be there too.

2007
01:54:06,339 --> 01:54:10,036
And to prove to me.. are
you out of your mind?

2008
01:54:10,710 --> 01:54:12,268
Babes, this is my only chance.

2009
01:54:13,646 --> 01:54:15,045
Day after tomorrow you
are getting married.

2010
01:54:16,215 --> 01:54:19,048
If not tomorrow then never.

2011
01:54:22,788 --> 01:54:26,554
If I move back now,
then I will fall in my own eyes.

2012
01:54:29,428 --> 01:54:31,760
But Akki, anything
can go wrong there.

2013
01:54:32,398 --> 01:54:33,422
Whatever happens,
let it happen.

2014
01:54:34,834 --> 01:54:38,167
If tomorrow, everything goes
according to our plans, then fine.

2015
01:54:40,106 --> 01:54:41,095
Or else..

2016
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:46,572
Have a prosperous married life.

2017
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:55,311
Just.. don't become a gangsters
sister in the next life.

2018
01:55:07,867 --> 01:55:09,630
Superstar in 100 rupees!

2019
01:55:09,702 --> 01:55:10,794
Superstar in 100 rupees!

2020
01:55:11,137 --> 01:55:12,263
Superstar in 100 rupees!

2021
01:55:12,338 --> 01:55:13,464
Come one, come all!

2022
01:55:13,539 --> 01:55:14,597
Superstar in 100 rupees!

2023
01:55:14,674 --> 01:55:15,800
Superstar in 100 rupees!

2024
01:55:25,484 --> 01:55:26,610
Superstar in 100 rupees!

2025
01:55:26,686 --> 01:55:27,744
Dude, the bag that Purshottam
is bringing the money in..

2026
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:29,219
..it is just like this, isn't it?

2027
01:55:29,288 --> 01:55:30,812
How many times do I tell you?

2028
01:55:31,157 --> 01:55:32,351
Superstar in 100 rupees!

2029
01:55:34,827 --> 01:55:36,158
And brother, we just have
to change the bag..

2030
01:55:36,228 --> 01:55:38,423
..with Purshottam's and run!

2031
01:55:38,497 --> 01:55:39,725
There is no need to show off. Ok.

2032
01:55:40,166 --> 01:55:41,758
- He must be coming here!

2033
01:55:42,168 --> 01:55:44,830
Whoever finds her, bring
her to this counter.

2034
01:55:45,171 --> 01:55:46,832
4 years old, Laxmi..

2035
01:55:46,906 --> 01:55:49,397
I am losing 1 crore..

2036
01:55:50,176 --> 01:55:52,542
Guys, Purshottam.

2037
01:55:59,318 --> 01:56:00,307
Look, Chawle has come.

2038
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:02,683
- Superstar in 100 rupees!

2039
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:04,854
I will go and keep Chawle busy.

2040
01:56:05,324 --> 01:56:06,848
- By then, you change the
bag with Purshottam's.

2041
01:56:06,926 --> 01:56:08,188
Okay!
- Okay!

2042
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:09,249
Okay!

2043
01:56:11,197 --> 01:56:12,528
Five rupees! Five rupees!

2044
01:56:12,598 --> 01:56:14,122
Chawle sir! Chawle sir!

2045
01:56:15,601 --> 01:56:17,296
It's me Akshay!
- Okay.

2046
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:18,860
I have come to cover everything.
- Ok, ok.

2047
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:21,197
When you will shoot C Kkompany..

2048
01:56:21,273 --> 01:56:23,138
..I will shoot you.

2049
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:25,609
With the camera, sir. - Okay.

2050
01:56:26,779 --> 01:56:28,337
Shoot me shooting him!

2051
01:56:28,614 --> 01:56:30,377
Yes. Don't worry!

2052
01:56:31,884 --> 01:56:33,681
By the way, have you come alone?

2053
01:56:33,953 --> 01:56:36,786
No, Dattu sir and my men
are scattered all around.

2054
01:56:37,323 --> 01:56:38,483
Today, they cannot escape.

2055
01:56:39,358 --> 01:56:40,689
Dattubhai has come himself too.

2056
01:56:41,327 --> 01:56:43,557
I can't see him anywhere.
Where is he?

2057
01:56:43,863 --> 01:56:46,195
The same place where he
wants to send C Kkompany!

2058
01:56:46,799 --> 01:56:48,494
Up there!
- Up!

2059
01:56:55,307 --> 01:56:56,433
Where did he go?

2060
01:56:56,742 --> 01:56:58,209
I will meet you later.
- Yes.

2061
01:56:58,944 --> 01:57:00,571
Are you keeping a watch?
- Yes, bhai.

2062
01:57:01,514 --> 01:57:03,641
The bird has flown in with the seed.

2063
01:57:03,716 --> 01:57:05,616
We are there, bhai, don't worry.

2064
01:57:05,885 --> 01:57:10,322
Today, the C Kkompany shouldn't
escape us. "C Kkompany"

2065
01:57:10,389 --> 01:57:13,256
Will anything go wrong?
- Nothing will go wrong, uncle.

2066
01:57:13,526 --> 01:57:15,255
Just that, our timings
should be perfect.

2067
01:57:16,362 --> 01:57:20,230
We have to complete
the mission properly.

2068
01:57:20,933 --> 01:57:23,424
"C Kkompany. C Kkompany"

2069
01:57:29,942 --> 01:57:30,931
Come on! - Come on!

2070
01:57:31,944 --> 01:57:32,933
Alam!
- Yes, bhai!

2071
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:34,940
That Mangal Pandey is running
away with the bag. - What?

2072
01:57:35,281 --> 01:57:36,339
Catch him!

2073
01:57:36,415 --> 01:57:38,747
That midget! Catch him!

2074
01:57:39,285 --> 01:57:42,948
Once I catch him, I will
make him see the stars.

2075
01:57:43,022 --> 01:57:45,820
Wait! You burning train!

2076
01:57:47,893 --> 01:57:50,259
Fatso. There he goes!

2077
01:57:50,996 --> 01:57:52,258
Catch him!

2078
01:57:55,868 --> 01:57:57,358
Bhai, Balaji is ringing.

2079
01:57:57,436 --> 01:58:00,269
Hey!..
- Yes, tell me.

2080
01:58:00,973 --> 01:58:04,636
If you are feeling giddy
in the shooting then what can I do?

2081
01:58:04,977 --> 01:58:05,966
Keep the phone!

2082
01:58:06,312 --> 01:58:08,644
Don't spare him!

2083
01:58:09,715 --> 01:58:10,704
Hey, come here.

2084
01:58:13,986 --> 01:58:15,544
There is the bag

2085
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:20,722
Hey you..
- Bhai, better late than never!

2086
01:58:20,793 --> 01:58:22,283
Wait. - Hey buddy!..

2087
01:58:23,896 --> 01:58:25,989
Bring the swing down! - What?

2088
01:58:26,065 --> 01:58:27,396
Bring the swing down!

2089
01:58:27,466 --> 01:58:28,899
I am! I am!

2090
01:58:33,906 --> 01:58:36,306
Bring the swing down!

2091
01:58:36,575 --> 01:58:37,803
Yes. I am! I am!

2092
01:58:42,915 --> 01:58:43,973
Seems like my name should have been..

2093
01:58:44,049 --> 01:58:46,677
..Dattu Doordarshan and
not Dattu Satellite.

2094
01:58:47,887 --> 01:58:49,616
Now I will have to do something.

2095
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:52,414
Catch this.

2096
01:59:11,377 --> 01:59:13,345
'The swing had already come down!'

2097
01:59:26,725 --> 01:59:28,022
They ran away throwing the bag.

2098
01:59:31,597 --> 01:59:32,655
C Kkompany!

2099
01:59:32,731 --> 01:59:33,720
This bag is empty.

2100
01:59:35,067 --> 01:59:38,468
But I saw them exchanging the bags.

2101
01:59:44,743 --> 01:59:47,906
Yes! C for cunning!

2102
01:59:49,081 --> 01:59:51,879
They knew that we are watching them.

2103
01:59:52,151 --> 01:59:54,517
Exchanging the bag is just a charade.

2104
01:59:54,587 --> 01:59:56,384
To fool us, understood.

2105
01:59:57,156 --> 01:59:58,418
Purshottam has the bag..

2106
01:59:58,490 --> 02:00:01,015
..and that's where we
will find C Kkompany.

2107
02:00:01,093 --> 02:00:02,082
Come on.

2108
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:05,688
Hey, Shravan Kumar!

2109
02:00:06,665 --> 02:00:07,962
Who is it? Who is it?

2110
02:00:08,033 --> 02:00:09,432
Your father, C Kkompany.

2111
02:00:11,103 --> 02:00:13,037
C Kkompany.

2112
02:00:13,105 --> 02:00:15,403
C Kkompany.

2113
02:00:16,475 --> 02:00:18,602
C Kkompany.

2114
02:00:24,483 --> 02:00:28,647
Hey! - Hey!
Where is the bag of money?

2115
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:29,779
The bag of money.

2116
02:00:29,855 --> 02:00:31,447
The C Kkompany people took it.

2117
02:00:31,790 --> 02:00:33,519
Why did you..

2118
02:00:34,126 --> 02:00:35,423
Who are you?

2119
02:00:36,195 --> 02:00:37,423
D Kkompany.

2120
02:00:40,599 --> 02:00:41,588
D Kkompany!

2121
02:00:42,835 --> 02:00:44,427
C Kkompany! D Kkompany!

2122
02:00:45,137 --> 02:00:47,731
Seems like everyone is after me.

2123
02:00:47,806 --> 02:00:49,671
C Kkompany.

2124
02:00:55,881 --> 02:00:57,041
C Kkompany.

2125
02:00:58,817 --> 02:00:59,875
You!

2126
02:01:00,552 --> 02:01:01,814
What are you doing here, babes?

2127
02:01:02,087 --> 02:01:03,679
I asked you to stay at the airport!

2128
02:01:03,989 --> 02:01:05,149
I couldn't wait, Akki!

2129
02:01:05,224 --> 02:01:07,158
I was getting tensed
thinking about you.

2130
02:01:07,226 --> 02:01:09,626
Let's go from here or else we
will be killed. - Let's go.

2131
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:15,466
- Let me find him then
I won't spare him.

2132
02:01:18,504 --> 02:01:19,493
Oh God.

2133
02:01:25,511 --> 02:01:26,569
We have got the money!

2134
02:01:26,645 --> 02:01:28,169
Now we just have look
for them and run.

2135
02:01:28,247 --> 02:01:30,112
Akki! Listen! Listen!

2136
02:01:30,182 --> 02:01:31,774
I was searching for you.

2137
02:01:31,850 --> 02:01:33,044
Lambodhar is stuck there.

2138
02:01:33,118 --> 02:01:34,710
We will have to do something
to get him out of there.

2139
02:01:34,787 --> 02:01:36,584
We will have to do something.

2140
02:01:36,655 --> 02:01:38,054
Now we have got him!

2141
02:01:38,524 --> 02:01:42,961
Listen! Somebody has lost her kid!
She is eight years old.

2142
02:01:43,028 --> 02:01:45,519
Yes! Priya, call me right now.

2143
02:01:45,597 --> 02:01:47,929
Quickly Priya! Now! - Ok.

2144
02:01:48,534 --> 02:01:50,525
She is eight years old.
- C'mon, fast!

2145
02:01:56,208 --> 02:01:57,732
Who is shooting?

2146
02:01:58,277 --> 02:01:59,539
Hey! Stop!

2147
02:01:59,611 --> 02:02:00,669
Do I look like a thief?

2148
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:25,898
Dude! Dattubhai!

2149
02:02:29,641 --> 02:02:31,973
Now we are caught!

2150
02:02:32,044 --> 02:02:33,033
Dattubhai!

2151
02:02:51,263 --> 02:02:53,128
C Kkompany!
- Huh?

2152
02:02:55,134 --> 02:02:57,728
Those who challenged
the government!

2153
02:02:59,104 --> 02:03:02,267
Challenged the power
of Dattu Satellite.

2154
02:03:03,275 --> 02:03:04,708
Why did you..

2155
02:03:04,777 --> 02:03:05,937
That's all of you?

2156
02:03:06,011 --> 02:03:08,275
Hey.. you!

2157
02:03:08,614 --> 02:03:11,276
I asked you so many times,
who is C Kkompany!

2158
02:03:11,617 --> 02:03:12,606
Who is C Kkompany!

2159
02:03:13,051 --> 02:03:14,177
I don't know.

2160
02:03:16,655 --> 02:03:18,987
And this old man. Grump!

2161
02:03:19,057 --> 02:03:22,993
Uncle, I had dropped till
the taxi, isn't it?

2162
02:03:25,798 --> 02:03:27,197
This midget.

2163
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:30,734
He closed down Dattu
Satellite's club!

2164
02:03:30,803 --> 02:03:31,929
Dattu Satellite's club!

2165
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:36,699
What are you staring at?

2166
02:03:37,309 --> 02:03:38,298
What are you staring at?

2167
02:03:38,644 --> 02:03:39,770
Shall I shoot you?

2168
02:03:39,845 --> 02:03:40,834
Lambodhar, look down!

2169
02:03:41,980 --> 02:03:44,244
No.. Dattubhai, it is
not their mistake.

2170
02:03:44,716 --> 02:03:45,910
It was entirely my plan.

2171
02:03:48,086 --> 02:03:50,611
I wanted to extort money
from Purshottam.

2172
02:03:51,256 --> 02:03:52,245
No Dattubhai, no!

2173
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:55,958
It is not Dude.. I mean uncle
Joshi or Lambodhar's fault.

2174
02:03:56,028 --> 02:03:57,154
It has happened because of me.

2175
02:03:57,229 --> 02:03:59,322
No, no, brother, I and Akshay
love each other a lot.

2176
02:03:59,665 --> 02:04:01,326
We wanted to elope and get married..

2177
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:02,662
Enough! Enough! Enough!

2178
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:06,799
Enough of your nonsense!

2179
02:04:08,273 --> 02:04:12,676
Now tell me, what should
we do with you.

2180
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:14,805
I think..

2181
02:04:15,781 --> 02:04:18,750
The same thing a bhai should
do with another bhai.

2182
02:04:18,817 --> 02:04:19,806
Bhai!

2183
02:04:24,089 --> 02:04:27,217
Good! Very good!

2184
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:31,693
The same thing a bhai should
do with another bhai.

2185
02:04:34,032 --> 02:04:35,090
You have guts!

2186
02:04:35,367 --> 02:04:36,629
You have a lot of guts!

2187
02:04:38,036 --> 02:04:41,938
You still haven't lost your pride.

2188
02:04:45,377 --> 02:04:49,370
Bhai, from today C Kkompany
is.. closed.

2189
02:04:49,448 --> 02:04:52,246
Yes, bhai, completely closed!

2190
02:04:55,387 --> 02:04:57,378
But my eyes have opened.

2191
02:04:58,991 --> 02:05:03,985
I realised today, that strength has
no relation with age or height.

2192
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:06,395
It lies in your intentions.

2193
02:05:13,872 --> 02:05:20,801
Now it seems like, I will have to
settle the C Kkompany matter.

2194
02:05:21,146 --> 02:05:26,743
I agree, the boy who can dare to
do something like this for you..

2195
02:05:26,818 --> 02:05:28,877
..he will love you a lot!

2196
02:05:30,956 --> 02:05:33,117
That's Dattu Satellite's guarantee!

2197
02:05:33,759 --> 02:05:35,727
Huggies!
- Brother!

2198
02:05:36,094 --> 02:05:37,425
Huggies.

2199
02:05:38,764 --> 02:05:39,753
Uncle!

2200
02:05:43,802 --> 02:05:46,293
'Dattubhai found out
who C Kkompany is.'

2201
02:05:46,371 --> 02:05:47,770
'But along with that, he resolved..

2202
02:05:47,839 --> 02:05:49,067
..the matter of B company too.'

2203
02:05:49,141 --> 02:05:50,369
We made a mistake the last time.

2204
02:05:51,443 --> 02:05:53,775
Last week, the woman's
face we showed you..

2205
02:05:53,845 --> 02:05:55,779
..after the plastic surgery..

2206
02:05:55,847 --> 02:05:58,816
..that woman was not the
daughter-in-law of your family.

2207
02:05:59,418 --> 02:06:02,819
The lady of your house is this.

2208
02:06:05,290 --> 02:06:06,723
Very good!

2209
02:06:09,962 --> 02:06:13,796
Doctor, I will never forget
your favour.

2210
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:20,763
If today, I have got a new life..
it is entirely because of you.

2211
02:06:24,409 --> 02:06:25,933
Because of you.

2212
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:33,780
In C-wing's flat no.102.

2213
02:06:34,052 --> 02:06:36,350
The roar of the old lion
could be heard again.

2214
02:06:37,923 --> 02:06:40,824
After all, Dude won the Maharashtra
Rajya (State) Lottery's..

2215
02:06:40,892 --> 02:06:42,018
..bumper award.

2216
02:06:46,431 --> 02:06:48,831
Lambodhar, after all,
fulfilled his dream..

2217
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:50,492
..of touching the sky.

2218
02:06:50,869 --> 02:06:53,838
If you want to work in his office..

2219
02:06:53,905 --> 02:06:56,840
..then along with the qualification..

2220
02:06:56,908 --> 02:06:58,808
..your height must be over 6 feet.

2221
02:07:00,846 --> 02:07:01,835
Papa.

2222
02:07:07,519 --> 02:07:09,851
I am sorry, papa. I am really sorry!

2223
02:07:09,921 --> 02:07:10,910
I am proud of you, papa.

2224
02:07:13,458 --> 02:07:15,426
'Small family, happy family.'

2225
02:07:15,861 --> 02:07:19,319
'Sometimes, size doesn't matter.'

2226
02:07:22,167 --> 02:07:24,863
'Priya and I got married after all!'

2227
02:07:25,370 --> 02:07:26,928
'lt was quite a unique marriage!'

2228
02:07:27,272 --> 02:07:29,866
'Half the guests were
from the police..

2229
02:07:29,941 --> 02:07:31,431
..and half were
from the underworld.'

2230
02:07:35,914 --> 02:07:38,940
'But the movie is still
remaining, my friend!

2231
02:07:39,284 --> 02:07:43,084
And in today's special news..
another escapade of the C Kkompany.

2232
02:07:43,155 --> 02:07:44,884
In a land grabbing case in Mumbai..

2233
02:07:44,956 --> 02:07:48,983
..C Kkompany foiled the
plans of the land mafia.

2234
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:51,894
According to a special report,
land grabbing..

2235
02:07:51,963 --> 02:07:54,864
..has become a dangerous problem
for the government!

2236
02:07:58,470 --> 02:08:02,167
Dattubhai! I swear we had closed
down C Kkompany that day.
