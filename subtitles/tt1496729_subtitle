00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:48,827
400 BC 
NagaDutta : Vishnugupta, what is dharma?

2
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:52,779
Vishnugupta Chankya : Dharma is doing what is necessary

3
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:55,934
Today

4
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,660
(Subbu) Please don't hit me because it isn't working

5
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:12,248
(Singaperumal/Ayya) Cunt-hair

6
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:16,706
Yo Chittu, you continue..

7
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:19,502
(Chittu) It's a simple matter

8
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:22,229
Say you are in a train..

9
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,140
And you see a MILF

10
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:28,340
You start the conversation by playing with the kid

11
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,376
Where ever you start, it's always gonna end in 2 topics

12
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:34,015
Politics and cinema

13
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:38,865
You start with a recent movie. From there you keep it going

14
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:41,847
Now, you ask the most important question

15
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:44,365
'You like Rajini or Kamal?'

16
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:46,598
Machi, that's the main matter.

17
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:49,442
That's how gotten with many MILFs

18
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:52,065
If they like Rajini, let them be

19
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:55,021
But if the like Kamal...

20
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:57,581
We can easily work those flirts

21
00:06:57,581 --> 00:06:58,681
Why is that?

22
00:06:58,696 --> 00:07:00,196
He looks sexy to them

23
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:01,976
That's it.

24
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,461
You can work them even if you don't know them

25
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,089
If you know them?

26
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:08,576
Then, ask if they are married

27
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,816
If you know them, why ask?

28
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:14,567
That's how they find out you are interested

29
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:15,555
Machi......

30
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:17,696
You can seduce any MILF in 4 steps

31
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,932
You can just sweet talk...

32
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:20,262
...Make them laugh...

33
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:24,326
... or just get them crying and work from there

34
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:26,307
Gimme an example

35
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:30,999
Ask if they are married..

36
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,310
If she likes you....

37
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,061
...she will reply 'No'

38
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:36,547
...with a smile

39
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:38,905
But if she replies 'Yes'...

40
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,818
Ask 'Are you actually happy?'

41
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:42,435
Some hoes will reply....

42
00:07:42,816 --> 00:07:45,453
...'Nothing's wrong. I am very happy'...

43
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,937
That's when you don't give up..

44
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:50,014
You ask 'Do you really think this will last?'

45
00:07:50,014 --> 00:07:51,368
'The man doesn't give a shit already'

46
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:54,330
.. and start some rumors about him.

47
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,260
Then what....

48
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,640
plenty of tears..

49
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,836
consoling her...

50
00:07:57,836 --> 00:07:58,716
and 'matter' (sex)

51
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,736
- If she doesn't cry?
-Then I will cry

52
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:03,016
Now she has to console me, right?

53
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:06,678
If she has a big man in her...

54
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:08,859
I will be the woman for her

55
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,219
Machi.... I have seduced atleast 100 MILFs

56
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:13,713
Out of them... 3 have tricked me

57
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:15,803
This is a 'sappa matter' (nothing)

58
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,809
What 'sappa matter'?

59
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:20,275
Our 'Sappa' has no matter

60
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:21,384
Really?

61
00:08:22,894 --> 00:08:24,525
(Sappa) I got everything

62
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:25,748
EVERYTHING?

63
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,826
Show it to us

64
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,661
hey, fuck off

65
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:30,818
Where to?

66
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:31,956
Here!

67
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:39,924
What is a pussy like you doing here?

68
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,490
Do you want a different job?

69
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:44,208
OK..

70
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:46,358
I will make a call, go see him

71
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,485
Whom?

72
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,002
Him!

73
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:59,055
Sappa.. why are you so 'sappa' (nothing)

74
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,502
Have you done anything in life?

75
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,150
Look at our Ayya!

76
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,955
Even at his age, he keeps up with an young girl

77
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:11,489
The old man doesn't trust us with her

78
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:13,061
But he trusts you

79
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,288
Why?

80
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,145
Because you are a 'sappa'

81
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:19,266
Are you gonna stay this way forever?

82
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:21,014
Or will you at least do something?

83
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:22,083
I will do everything

84
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,207
Everything?

85
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:24,793
Compared to this that was way better?

86
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:25,858
Which is?

87
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,302
This!

88
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:34,339
(Pasupathy) Hey Sappa, go buy me a tea

89
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,895
I bought it already

90
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:40,140
OK, buy one more

91
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:43,366
You stay here

92
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,528
A mule has come from Rameswaram

93
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:34,523
- What is it?

94
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:36,407
Powdered cocaine

95
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:39,261
Market rate is ₹20,000,000

96
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,286
He is willing to sell for ₹5,000,000

97
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:50,204
- Why?

98
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:52,976
- His sister loves me?

99
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:56,261
It's not his

100
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,908
He is just a mule

101
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:01,995
He is not happy with his cut

102
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:04,983
So he want to sell it for ₹5,000,000 and settle in life

103
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:06,128
- Whose is it?

104
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:08,283
Gajendran's

105
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:11,948
- He will fuck our shit out

106
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:12,994
Let him

107
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:18,399
Yeah, he will try. We are not gonna be quiet

108
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:20,861
We can manage

109
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:24,210
If the stuff is in our hands

110
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:27,393
.. then we can control the business for some time

111
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,380
We can go back to what we were...

112
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:37,677
It's a... good deal

113
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:46,808
Why? Are you a limp dick now?

114
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:50,215
Grandpa has gone limp

115
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:53,609
Can I speak my mind?

116
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:58,054
Lend me ₹5,000,000, I will take care of the business

117
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,410
The risk is all mine.

118
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:03,531
Now on, I will take over such risky businesses

119
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:07,409
We will split the profits 50-50

120
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:09,503
What do you think?

121
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,296
- Can we do the deal tomorrow?

122
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:39,916
(yes)

123
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,992
- I will call the Marwari

124
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,457
- He will give a 'five'

125
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,099
- Go fetch it

126
00:12:57,001 --> 00:13:00,149
- You first check the stuff

127
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:04,680
- We will think about our cuts later

128
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:11,786
- Pasupathy

129
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,736
- I am no limp dick

130
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,344
- Still got it

131
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:31,575
Mayilvaganam Sir, we are here

132
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:36,329
Who's doing this business? Ayya or you?

133
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:40,474
Don't know. That is Ayya's style

134
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:43,406
(Chittu) You kept running your mouth

135
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:45,771
We shit our pants, didn't know what to do there

136
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,886
'you didn't know what to do'?

137
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,641
Do as Ayya tells you to!

138
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:51,886
You do work for him..

139
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:54,599
Bark if you dress up as a dog

140
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,631
(on phone)Yeah, tell me Kasthuri!

141
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,386
I am coming

142
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:02,421
I am on a job

143
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,654
Pasupathy, what's with the crowd?

144
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:24,803
♪ (Ponmeni uruguthey from Moondram Pirai)♪

145
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:27,473
Isn't it a good song?

146
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:30,741
I love this girl (Actress Silk Smitha)

147
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:33,128
Poor girl! Untimely death

148
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:36,473
(Pasupathy) Sir, where is the stuff?

149
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:44,253
They told me it has arrived. It's some name.

150
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:47,827
It's in the tip of my tongue. But it's not coming to me yet.

151
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,441
Do you know why?

152
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,913
Bava lodge

153
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:06,871
Are you gonna snatch it?

154
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,289
Don't know

155
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:13,255
Sir, can you keep this quiet?

156
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:15,888
Don't know

157
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:21,183
(Chittu) Pasupathy, I thought he was Gajendran's man?

158
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:22,769
You think he is a thug?

159
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:25,058
He is a police sub-inspector

160
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:27,254
If there is money, he will work for anyone

161
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:29,203
What is he saying about me?

162
00:16:29,242 --> 00:16:31,618
Nothing bad, you carry on boss

163
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,643
Do you realize whose stuff it is?

164
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:40,818
A good drink is never without a stink.

165
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:43,840
You know about Gajendran, don't you?

166
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:46,493
He is a SOB. Better watch your ass.

167
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:50,144
What's all this fuss about Gajendran?

168
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,848
Is he a big dickwagger?

169
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,222
Yes, he is the biggest

170
00:16:57,402 --> 00:16:58,952
Master, 5 teas!

171
00:17:00,424 --> 00:17:02,638
Let me tell you a story

172
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,603
15 years back..

173
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:09,739
Gajendran and Gajapathy were peaking in their import/export business

174
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:12,407
There was this guy, related to them....

175
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,507
Brother-in-law?

176
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,054
A distant brother-in-law

177
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:17,273
He was working as a mule for them

178
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,313
In a deal...

179
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,708
...instead of 10 pieces only 8 showed up

180
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:26,403
Gajendran had a big doubt on the mule

181
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:28,566
He brought mule's whole family...

182
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,878
- ... and kicked the piss out
- His own brother-in-law?

183
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,833
ha, that's mean shit

184
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,933
Right in front his family...

185
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:37,891
... broke his fucking face

186
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,333
Then he poured boiling oil on him..

187
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,438
...the skin started peeling off

188
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,370
His kids are crying out loud now

189
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:45,770
His wife is hysterical

190
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,725
After all that, he still sticks to his story

191
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:51,398
Now comes the plot twist

192
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:53,907
A call comes in..

193
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:55,596
...for Gajendran

194
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,190
'Boss, the stuff is all alright'

195
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,703
'It was a packing mistake..'

196
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:02,206
'The Mule's hands are clean'

197
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,409
...and the call ended.

198
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:07,311
The beaten up mule is now staring at Gajendran

199
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,903
Gajendran slowly took out a knife out of his pocket..

200
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:12,456
...and sliced open mule's throat

201
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:15,936
The blood gushed out like flush water

202
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,841
Mule was dead

203
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:20,896
Why he did that?

204
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:24,299
'After all this torture today...'

205
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,330
'...if he gets a chance tomorrow...'

206
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:28,461
'...and the knife turns around...'

207
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:30,089
'..that's why!'

208
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,379
Now brother Gajapathy goes to the wife...

209
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:34,509
'It was a honest mistake..'

210
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,648
'.. was a business misunderstanding'

211
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,000
'So, don't bring it up ever'

212
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:41,533
He even apologized to her

213
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:45,332
Now Gajendran walks to the wife ...

214
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,971
...takes her hand like he is consoling her..

215
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,106
..and says 'Don't let anyone know'...

216
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:53,351
..takes her hand to his mouth..

217
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,945
...and bites the fucking thumb off her hand.

218
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,111
'She agreed not to say a word'

219
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:01,362
'Then, why did you bite the finger?'

220
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:02,655
... asks Gajapathy

221
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,303
'After she speaks, it's no use in chopping fingers '

222
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:09,696
That's Gajendran

223
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:13,522
The girl never came back in town after

224
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:27,110
Just with his teeth?

225
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,132
I have heard a story about a vanishing ghost hitchhiker

226
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:33,432
Ask if they have seen it, they will reply 'no'

227
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:35,828
But his acquaintance's acquaintance had seen it

228
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:38,488
This is just a built up legend

229
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:40,259
...and you fell for it

230
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:41,931
You only look smart..

231
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:44,067
..but you are dumb ass

243
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:33,438
(Kalaiyan) The cutie is not that cute

244
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:36,537
...but she still makes me jealous of you

245
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,905
You jelly?

246
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,252
If you get caught, you are a jelly

247
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,237
So, I have decided..

248
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,965
I am not giving it this time

249
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,570
Instead

250
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:49,245
I am giving it to these guys

251
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:52,932
They have tricked by throwing just 10,000 at me

252
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:55,342
I didn't know about it's worth

253
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,030
How much you get here?

254
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:01,545
15,000?

255
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:04,257
20,000?

256
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:07,633
That much?

257
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:16,316
What is in here?

258
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:17,941
Like X-ray goggles?

259
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:20,856
Can we see everything through the clothes?

260
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,506
hmm, you will see nothing

261
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,322
All lights are out

262
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:27,597
You will feel nothing

263
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:35,287
It's white man's snuff

264
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:37,824
I am settled for life with this

265
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:41,295
A drink to that

266
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:42,571
One for me?

267
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:58,577
(Kodukkapuli) Haven't moved it's lazy ass

268
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,435
Hey Kalaiya

269
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:02,916
Why is Kodukkapuli pissed?

270
00:22:03,428 --> 00:22:05,153
Is he yelling at the cock or me?

271
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:07,337
I have the same question

272
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:08,836
Hey Kodukkapuli

273
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:10,432
Feed the cock it will be hungry now

274
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,022
Mind your fucking business

275
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:15,186
He is a funny talker

276
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:18,084
A kid is cursing at you, do you have no shame?

277
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:20,018
What's the shame in it?

278
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:22,677
He is my own blood

279
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,593
My son Kodukkapuli...

280
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:27,772
Curse a few swear words at your dad

281
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,675
He won't curse now, that's the technique

282
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,030
He is just like his mom

283
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,671
Fair skinned , wavy hair...

284
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:42,538
.. and a proud person

285
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:45,355
I gambled away all my fortunes..

286
00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:47,334
.. that's why the anger

287
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,095
No, I may not look that way

288
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:54,308
I am from a Zamindar(aristocrat) family

289
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:57,550
Someone just bought my palace to make it a hotel

290
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,579
Idiots

291
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:01,357
I lost everything

292
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,662
At last, I opened a small store

293
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:06,937
I gave away the goods on credit

294
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,690
When I went asking for money..

295
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:12,229
They replied, 'How can an aristocrat ask money?'

296
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,990
I couldn't insist on returning the money...

297
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:15,352
....from those poor peasants

298
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,982
But I couldn't leave it at that

299
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:20,504
Then, I borrowed ₹2,000 to buy more goods...

300
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:23,057
.. but it was some kind of rocket interest loan

301
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:26,254
The lender is now asking for ₹5,000 to payoff

302
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,623
Now, threatening too

303
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,258
Where do I go for that much money?

304
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:31,312
That's why, we brought the cock here

305
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:36,132
Now, after Kaattu Munieswaran, he is our family deity

306
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:38,627
This Kaalayan's last treasure

307
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:42,318
After he wins today, I am going to settle all debts

308
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:43,775
... and save my family

309
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:45,804
Come here my golden goose

310
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:48,169
(Kudukkapulli) Don't touch my rooster.

311
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,609
It's actually his rooster

312
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:53,443
To me, he is my son.

313
00:23:53,443 --> 00:23:55,233
For him, the rooster is his son

314
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,775
If it were mine, I would have sold and gotten drunk

315
00:23:58,373 --> 00:24:00,839
Kaalaya, whom did you borrow the money from?

316
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:02,673
From Varaagamoorthy

317
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:04,171
That asshole?

318
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:06,875
If he doesn't get back the money...

319
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:09,211
... he sells their wives and kids for prostitution

320
00:24:09,652 --> 00:24:11,670
So, it is for real?

321
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:14,056
Does it really happen?

322
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:17,146
I didn't listen to anyone's advice back home

323
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:19,425
You came from nowhere and you know what he does

324
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,585
I had no clue

325
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:23,535
Everything is lost

326
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,977
Drink up, all will be well

327
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:29,515
You don't think it will happen?

328
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:30,757
Don't worry

329
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:34,009
You! who talks like that?

330
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:36,227
Act like a grown man

331
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:40,215
OK, stop drinking. Listen to the grown up there

332
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:44,449
He is angry

333
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:46,847
I am proud

334
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:48,238
I have a room

335
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:49,776

336
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,359

00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:04,427
You were upset...

371
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:06,530
..was trying to console you

372
00:31:08,227 --> 00:31:10,066
I don't know these things....

373
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:12,402
That's why I am 'Sappa' and no one likes me

374
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,409
But I really like you

375
00:31:15,355 --> 00:31:16,165
Why?

376
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:19,103
Because you are like me...

377
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:25,483
Don't cry

378
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,200
- You need some talent for that
- (on phone) I am in Madras now

379
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,293
If I walk on the streets...

380
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,571
I can get both the girl and her mom

381
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:22,205
(on phone) Don't fuss. I will come home for dinner.

382
00:32:22,562 --> 00:32:24,592
I will come home at night

383
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,736
Let me tell you something

384
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,406
I have seduced many MILFs

385
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,716
But there is one MILF, I want to do...

386
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,623
... our Subbu

387
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:41,807
(on phone) wear that red sari

388
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:43,567
Why are you looking at me like that?

389
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:45,077
Don't you have that idea?

390
00:32:45,077 --> 00:32:46,997
Will you kick her off the bed?

391
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:48,772
Well, he is loyal

392
00:32:48,772 --> 00:32:50,633
You don't wish that?

393
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:54,335
Everyone staring like I am a pervert

394
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:55,782
That poor girl!

395
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,976
I am thinking with love too

396
00:32:58,214 --> 00:32:59,754
I do really like her

397
00:33:00,217 --> 00:33:02,568
Ayya tricked her that she will be a movie star

398
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:05,491
I have liked her since then

399
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:11,502
Pardon me you high Sirs.

400
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,903
(on phone) OK stop talking and cut the phone

401
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,808
Anna(bro), is it Anni(sis-in-law)?

402
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:19,243
No, sunni(dick)

403
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:21,393
oh, he is pissed. Let me see

404
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,341
What is this shit-brick?

405
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:27,571
There are way better phones now

406
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:30,376
Why do you still have this?

407
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,471
- Why do I need that?
- Why?

408
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:35,508
In a video phone, you can watch actress showering

409
00:33:35,728 --> 00:33:38,947
What can you see in that tiny screen? Give it back

410
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,702
OK, no video phone

411
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,264
Why not buy a color or speaker phone?

412
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:49,094
Why do you need a speaker? Are you deaf?

413
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:52,561
Look at our Chittu

414
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:56,906
When MILFs speak to him, we listen to it on speaker

415
00:33:58,748 --> 00:34:02,748
'You are the best, my husband is nothing'

416
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:04,223
It gets me going

417
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:06,583
Don't they know it's on speaker?

418
00:34:07,555 --> 00:34:08,888
The ones falling for him?

419
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:11,254
They all have to be dumb

420
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:13,068
Don't talk bad about them, Pasupathy

421
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:15,684
It's not about being dumb or sharp. It's technology

422
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:17,871
Let me put this call on speaker..

423
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:20,511
If they don't find it out...

424
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:23,108
... you are buying beer for all of us

425
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,550
Why beer for everyone?

426
00:34:26,143 --> 00:34:29,380
You spoke before them, so you should

427
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:31,875
Sir, Sir, please get the phone

428
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,747
They wouldn't mind, lets bet on it

429
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:41,829
Shhh. It's Ayya

430
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:45,863
- Yeah, what's up?
- (male voice) Are you busy?

431
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:46,891
No, I am not

432
00:34:46,891 --> 00:34:50,120
(Ayya) Why didn't you answer, nasty cunt?

433
00:34:50,727 --> 00:34:53,051
It was in my pocket so it took a while

434
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:55,749
Where are the goods?

435
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:01,817
Have you gone past the police checkpost?

436
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:03,303
Not yet

437
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:06,647
OK, kill Pasupathy before the checkpost

438
00:35:27,362 --> 00:35:28,999
Aren't we all friends?

439
00:35:29,984 --> 00:35:33,194
Then, why the cunt-hair you tooled up?

440
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,858
As you said, "Bark if you dress up as a dog"

441
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:42,010
You can also wag your tail

442

He will have to return to save Kasthuri

- Let him come
- Where is Kasthuri?

493

She is right next to me

494
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:51,812
Don't bring her home yet

495

Because that's where he will check first

496
00:45:57,066 --> 00:46:00,420
Top off your tank and keep driving around the city

497
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:03,505
Don't stop anywhere for long

498
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:05,663

- Is Kasthuri any trouble?
- No

00:46:22,286 --> 00:46:24,922
Then don't give her any trouble either

503
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:27,555

Everything has happened already, so answer me

508
00:46:59,556 --> 00:47:01,106
Kamal or Rajini?

509
00:47:01,106 --> 00:47:02,146
You tell me

He french kisses all actresses

512
00:47:09,075 --> 00:47:11,265
In the movie 'Hey Ram', .....

513
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,720
.... he bites both actresses' asses

514
00:47:14,518 --> 00:47:17,095
- But I like Vijayakanth
- Why?

515
00:47:17,285 --> 00:47:20,687
He is the one who always saves India from Pakistan

516
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,745
He gets justice no matter who does wrong

517
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:27,441
If a lady is in danger, he will risk a big fight

518
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,869
OK. Can you choose between Rajini and Kamal?

519
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:33,079
Kamal

520
00:47:33,331 --> 00:47:35,931
Hey, aren't you lying for me?

521
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:38,093
So, Rajini?

522
00:47:38,612 --> 00:47:40,992
- Why?
- Because he is Rajini

523
00:47:41,143 --> 00:47:43,243
- Which is your favorite movie?
- Baashha

524
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,037
We all would think that he was a common person...

525
00:47:47,037 --> 00:47:49,377
... but Rajini was Baashaa, the don

526
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:50,892
Just like me!

527
00:47:50,965 --> 00:47:53,387
Everyone thinks I am a 'Sappa'...

528
00:47:53,648 --> 00:47:56,373
...only you know the real me

529
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:05,807
(whispers) Is it Ayya?

530
00:49:35,283 --> 00:49:38,725
I didn't think I will ever see you alive

531
00:49:52,843 --> 00:49:55,030
Get lost.... ass....cunt waxer

532
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,332
- hey, why are you cursing me?
- I asked you to shut your foul mouth

533
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:01,094
- What did I do?
- Why did you touch my chicken?

534
00:50:01,225 --> 00:50:04,104
After we won, what's the need for that victory song?

535
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:06,624
He killed him, because he was pissed at you

536
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:10,110
I swear on you, I did nothing. You saw it didn't you?

537
00:50:17,549 --> 00:50:19,051
It hurts

538
00:50:32,427 --> 00:50:34,666
oh my child, why are you crying?

539

541
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:45,919
No. None of that will happen

542
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:49,032
Our Kattumuni god wouldn't let that happen

543
00:50:49,032 --> 00:50:52,349
- Your dad is here!
- You are a wastrel loser

544
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:58,914
I can't bear if you too call me that

545
00:52:57,643 --> 00:53:00,270
Dad, hold this. Let us leave now

546
00:53:01,284 --> 00:53:03,387
- Did you steal this?
- No

547
00:53:03,572 --> 00:53:06,263
- Then? Did he give it to you?
- No, I took it

548
00:53:06,757 --> 00:53:09,914
- Hey, that's wrong
- In our situation, nothing is wrong

549
00:53:11,473 --> 00:53:13,904
He was planning to settle down with this

550
00:53:14,536 --> 00:53:16,831
I am begging you, lets leave

551
00:53:18,986 --> 00:53:21,523
He bought us liquor, he is like a god

552
00:53:21,523 --> 00:53:23,924
- We shouldn't betray him
- Leave me!!

553
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:30,753
Dad, don't go. You will get caught

554
00:53:32,735 --> 00:53:34,520
Retard

555
00:53:42,212 --> 00:53:44,503
Why did you kill him?

556
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:46,114
No, he is sleeping

557
00:53:46,114 --> 00:53:48,121
He is not breathing. He is dead.

558
00:53:48,149 --> 00:53:53,161
- You stealer, you must have killed him!
- I didn't. He kept on drinking with you, you killed him!

559
00:53:59,335 --> 00:54:02,918
- I didn't kill him
- Then, why will I kill him?

560
00:54:06,807 --> 00:54:09,980
Came here....showed compassion...

561
00:54:10,243 --> 00:54:12,705
He drank... smoked...

562
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:16,340
Left us in a jiffy. I can't understand

563
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,707
Dad, I can understand

564
00:54:21,707 --> 00:54:23,556
What do you understand?

565
00:54:23,556 --> 00:54:24,880
In our village....

566
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,508
...when our lost cow, came back what did gradma say?

567
00:54:28,508 --> 00:54:31,549
'Our god Kattumuni brought it back'

568
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:33,886
This is given to us by Kattumuni

569
00:54:33,886 --> 00:54:35,689
He couldn't bear our suffering...

570
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,871
... he came through someone's body...

571
00:54:37,871 --> 00:54:41,823
gave the goods...the details...and left

572
00:54:43,168 --> 00:54:45,718
Have we seen this guy before?

573
00:54:45,718 --> 00:54:48,590
Then why did he show up and give us this?

574
00:54:51,892 --> 00:54:55,316
You still don't believe it? See what we have offered

575
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:05,431
Oh, that is Kattumuni

576
00:55:40,552 --> 00:55:43,027
Lets go, religious rioter!

577
00:55:43,434 --> 00:55:45,488
Why are you in a hurry?

578
00:55:45,488 --> 00:55:47,178
God is with us

579
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:52,151
From today, all debts are gone. Worries gone.

580
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:55,531
Ache gone. Agony gone. Misery gone.

581
00:57:28,768 --> 00:57:30,248
Brother, it's not here.

582
00:57:31,013 --> 00:57:32,668
Go check again

583
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:34,228
I searched well

584
00:57:34,228 --> 00:57:38,228
The deal we heard about with Pasupathy, must be true

585
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:45,819
If you were alive now.... I would have killed you

586
00:58:58,009 --> 00:59:00,624
Why pick up the phone, if you won't talk?

587
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:02,844
It has been a long time

588
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:05,075
Singapermal! Why did you steal my drugs?

589
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:07,355
Whose drugs are those?

590
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,676
Reply

591
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,380
It's mine

592
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,185
Whose mule brought it?

593
00:59:13,185 --> 00:59:14,535
He is mine too

594
00:59:14,535 --> 00:59:16,975
But I heard Pasupathy is going to steal it

595
00:59:16,975 --> 00:59:19,765
Then whom should you talk to?

596
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:21,992
Reply

597
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,520
To Pasupathy

598
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,258
- Is this Pasupathy's number?
- No

599
00:59:28,258 --> 00:59:30,719
Sorry wrong number

600
00:59:32,365 --> 00:59:34,123
Motherfucker

601
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,834
I told you so

602
00:59:47,537 --> 00:59:48,997
Motherfucker!

603
00:59:48,997 --> 00:59:52,187
Are you making me suck my own dick?

604
00:59:52,187 --> 00:59:54,137
- Do you think I am a dumb fuck?
- Gajapathy

605
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:55,877
- I will tear you a new one
- Gajapathy!

606
00:59:55,877 --> 00:59:59,737
Don't you know the value of drugs? I will destroy you

607
00:59:59,737 --> 01:00:03,706
Everyone knows about your brother Gajendran

608
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:06,217
I wouldn't take your drugs

609
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:08,807
Pasupathy took it

610
01:00:10,029 --> 01:00:14,029
Doesn't make a fucking difference if he took or you did

611
01:00:14,029 --> 01:00:16,379
He used to be my man, but not anymore

612
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:19,066
Don't mess with me. I will kill him

613
01:00:19,066 --> 01:00:22,166
Kill him and show me your not a bitch

614
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:25,526
I will buy you a sucker

615
01:00:27,608 --> 01:00:29,298
Mullu is from that area, right?

616
01:00:29,298 --> 01:00:31,900
- Ask him to kill Pasupathy
- But he still got the drugs

617
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,590
- Then kill him after getting the drugs
- Mullu is pain in the ass

618
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,570
I don't care

619
01:00:40,587 --> 01:00:44,007
Singaperumal, if I find out you both are playing me...

620
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:47,377
... I will crush your balls. You know me.

621
01:00:48,361 --> 01:00:52,361
I have told you. Don't care if you won't believe

622
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,710
If you want to show up...

623
01:00:56,115 --> 01:00:59,621
You got your sickle, right? We can resolve with it

624
01:01:02,737 --> 01:01:05,731
Gajendran doesn't have the drugs

625
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:08,461
Pasupathy hasn't reached there yet

626
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:15,171
Send few our men, let them search for it

627
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:19,885
It should be at the lodge... bring it to me

628
01:01:20,898 --> 01:01:24,898
By then, Gajendran would have killed Pasupathy

629
01:01:27,281 --> 01:01:30,751
3 birds with one stone

630
01:01:32,245 --> 01:01:35,189
Drugs in our hands... one bird

631
01:01:36,374 --> 01:01:39,393
Gajendran killing Pasupathy... second bird

632
01:01:39,974 --> 01:01:42,396
What's the third bird?

633
01:01:42,692 --> 01:01:46,524
You are the stupid turkey. Go do the job.

634
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,400
Did you see?

635
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,751
Your buddies came and picked her up

636
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:02,840
- When?
- It has been a while

637
01:02:11,118 --> 01:02:13,369
Son of a whore!

638
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:15,806
what's with the swearing?

639
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:17,846
I genuinely asked something...

640
01:02:17,846 --> 01:02:20,246
...but you tried to kill me

641
01:02:20,246 --> 01:02:22,456
Now, you have taken Kasthuri

642
01:02:23,396 --> 01:02:25,979
You shouldn't have done that... Singaperumal

643
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:27,387
Eat all you can ..

644
01:02:27,387 --> 01:02:28,797
..drink..

645
01:02:28,797 --> 01:02:31,483
Motherfucker.... your mom's... this is your last day

646
01:02:32,243 --> 01:02:34,169
Dei Mokka blade...

647
01:02:34,169 --> 01:02:36,857
...firstly, try to save your own ass

648
01:02:41,205 --> 01:02:42,841
Mullu...

649
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,782
You shouldn't have done that... Singaperumal

650
01:02:52,782 --> 01:02:54,471
Eat all you can ..

651
01:02:54,485 --> 01:02:55,541
..drink..

652
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:58,798
Motherfucker.... your mom's... this is your last day

653
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:01,333
Dei Mokka blade...

654
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:03,725
...firstly, try to save your own ass

655
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,150
Mullu

656
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:12,500
Where's the stuff?

657
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,072
I am dealing with a different problem

658
01:03:14,072 --> 01:03:15,459
Where's the stuff?

659
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:16,769
I don't know

660
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:20,759
- I am talking here... why did you do that?
- He doesn't understand reason... kill him

661
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:23,039
- Don't give me orders, do as I say
- Just give me a spanner...

662
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:43,689
Kasthuri is in danger..

663
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:54,409
Singaperumal is trying to kill me

664
01:04:00,706 --> 01:04:03,446
Gajendran's men are chasing to get me

665
01:04:10,411 --> 01:04:12,749
Gajendran's men were sent to kill

666
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:20,239
Tension... tension... tension...

667
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:24,239
Relax Machaaaaa(bro)

668
01:04:29,621 --> 01:04:31,553
Buddha had Bodhi tree...

669
01:04:31,553 --> 01:04:33,538
To a gangster... it's the chase...

670
01:04:33,582 --> 01:04:37,582
The fear of being killed by whom and when is no more

671
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,422
Because, he is going to kill...

672
01:04:39,422 --> 01:04:41,437
... and he is killing me now....

673
01:04:41,437 --> 01:04:42,987
NOW

674
01:04:42,987 --> 01:04:45,095
Now, I am not running alone

675
01:04:45,095 --> 01:04:47,464
...my death is running along

676
01:04:47,464 --> 01:04:49,903
After meeting death face to face..

677
01:04:49,903 --> 01:04:51,822
..I have no confusion

678
01:04:52,843 --> 01:04:55,322
My mind is all clear

679
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:27,833
If they took Kasthuri, to make me go there....

680
01:05:29,146 --> 01:05:33,146
... she will be alive till I get there.

681
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:36,557
For now, Kasthuri is safe

682
01:05:39,626 --> 01:05:42,732
Till they get the drugs, they won't kill me

683
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:45,242
.... till then I am safe as well

684
01:05:46,405 --> 01:05:48,770
Next problem - Singaperumal

685
01:05:48,908 --> 01:05:51,192
He is a heavy weight

686
01:05:51,192 --> 01:05:53,252
I can't do anything alone

687
01:05:54,668 --> 01:05:56,904
Enemy's enemy is a friend

688
01:05:57,213 --> 01:05:59,460
Ayya taught me that

689
01:06:00,472 --> 01:06:02,875
Gajendran is Ayya's enemy

690
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,887
He is a heavy weight too

691
01:06:04,887 --> 01:06:08,074
But his son-of-the-whore are chasing me

692
01:06:08,074 --> 01:06:10,082
Think. Think. Think.

693
01:06:12,638 --> 01:06:15,429
In a day, when friends become enemies...

694
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:18,347
What does an enemy become?

695
01:06:25,384 --> 01:06:27,496
Shoot me or leave me

696
01:07:21,107 --> 01:07:23,965
Why did you buy me a samosa?

697
01:07:24,276 --> 01:07:26,392
Because I love you

698
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:33,010
What!

699
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,760
Always?

700
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,220
What is this?

701
01:07:37,952 --> 01:07:43,552
♪ (Super Mario Bros. music) ♪

702
01:08:17,002 --> 01:08:18,818
Just like in the game....

703
01:08:19,091 --> 01:08:21,550
...what if we go to a different world

704
01:08:22,206 --> 01:08:24,620
We can be far away from Ayya

705
01:08:24,739 --> 01:08:28,739
When you were playing it, that's what I was thinking

706
01:08:28,739 --> 01:08:32,183
We don't have to go that far..lets go to Bombay

707
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,939
Oh yeah.

708
01:08:34,096 --> 01:08:36,118
Nobody there knows Ayya

709
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:38,888
Dawood Bhai is the big shot there

710
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:50,309
After we reach Bombay, we buy a 30th floor apartment

711
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:52,158
where we can see the whole city

712
01:08:52,518 --> 01:08:54,391
Also a car... a red one

713
01:08:54,391 --> 01:08:56,237
But I will drive

714
01:08:56,907 --> 01:08:59,068
Subbu, can you drive?

715
01:09:00,211 --> 01:09:02,542
I will learn to

716
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,157
But, we will need money for all that

717
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:10,716
...we got none

718
01:09:14,482 --> 01:09:17,112
I will become a day laborer to make a living

719
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:20,142
No need. If we go to Bombay, we should be rich

720
01:09:22,129 --> 01:09:24,513
May be I will become a Hindi cinema heroine...

721
01:09:24,513 --> 01:09:26,657
... you become my manager

722
01:09:26,657 --> 01:09:27,992
No need

723
01:09:28,816 --> 01:09:31,500
I know. You are jealous?

724
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:34,590
You don't want any other men to touch me

725
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:39,239
Idiot, what if Ayya recognizes your face from the poster

726
01:09:39,599 --> 01:09:41,093
Correct

727
01:09:42,785 --> 01:09:44,894
It will be good to have money..

728
01:09:44,894 --> 01:09:47,746
Where do we go for money, if not for stealing?

729
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:51,523
Don't tell me that we will steal!

730
01:09:51,558 --> 01:09:54,835
We shouldn't take money away from those in need

731
01:09:58,713 --> 01:10:01,463
But..... if we steal like the movie 'Gentleman'?

732
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:03,073
And rob the wicked?

733
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:06,383
The only evil rich man we know is Ayya

734
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:09,058
What if we steal from Ayya?

735
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:20,017

736
01:10:46,139 --> 01:10:48,466
Hey Kodukkapuli...

737
01:10:48,515 --> 01:10:50,654
In our whole village...

738
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:54,015
Even in our whole community...

739
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:57,416
I am the only one who drank with our family deity

740
01:10:58,151 --> 01:11:00,498
If I say this... no one will believe it

741
01:11:00,498 --> 01:11:03,635
Don't say shit, everyone will laugh out of their asses

742
01:11:06,747 --> 01:11:09,352
Right! You are right

743
01:11:09,352 --> 01:11:11,121
The whole world is like this..

744
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:13,333
...always laughing at the poor

745
01:11:13,959 --> 01:11:16,135
Lets say there is a rich man...

746
01:11:16,135 --> 01:11:18,363
He gets off a pleasure car

747
01:11:18,363 --> 01:11:20,196
His dhoti slips off

748
01:11:20,196 --> 01:11:22,334
What will people say?

749
01:11:22,334 --> 01:11:26,532
'Oh no... the good man's dhoti has fallen down'

750
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,765
But if dhoti slips for people like us...

751
01:11:29,765 --> 01:11:33,988
they will say 'Motherfucker, he can't even tie a dhoti'

752
01:11:33,988 --> 01:11:36,257
Money is very important, Kodukkapuli

753
01:11:36,257 --> 01:11:38,929
Then, why the fuck did you gamble it away?

754
01:11:39,743 --> 01:11:41,671
I was deceived

755
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:44,815
Everyone tricked me

756
01:11:44,815 --> 01:11:46,987
yeah, you are always like this

757
01:11:46,987 --> 01:11:48,447
Not any more

758
01:11:48,447 --> 01:11:51,239
We can earn back all that money in one phone call

759
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:54,069
Isn't it? What is it?

760
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:57,296
- Phone number is in the room dumbass
- Stop, I am coming too

761
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:29,599
Where is it dad?

762
01:12:29,599 --> 01:12:31,910
We were talking right here

763
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:34,727
He also spoke about his 'cutie', remember?

764
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:36,474
Is it not here? did we lose it?

765
01:12:36,474 --> 01:12:39,259
All is lost!

766
01:12:39,278 --> 01:12:42,038
I knew it! Luck and us?

767
01:12:42,038 --> 01:12:43,885
- Kodukkapuli
- Search you ass

768
01:12:43,885 --> 01:12:45,429
Why?

769
01:12:45,429 --> 01:12:47,997
One can oil up and roll on the sand

770
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:49,970
...only sand you get is what is meant for you

771
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:52,654
The astrologer was right back then...

772
01:12:52,678 --> 01:12:55,124
..'you will lose everything you have'

773
01:12:55,124 --> 01:12:57,522
..'you won't get anything new either'

774
01:12:58,472 --> 01:13:00,172
Shut your hole and search

775
01:13:00,212 --> 01:13:02,172
I shouldn't tell you this

776
01:13:02,172 --> 01:13:04,460
So many women lined up to marry me

777
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,708
Instead, I married your mom, why?

778
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:09,067
Fate

779
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:11,227
- Nothing good ever happens to me. 
- hey, move

780
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:14,666
It won't happen. I am a loser.

781
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:16,604
Is this it?

782
01:13:18,848 --> 01:13:20,496
We found it?

783
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:23,083
I knew it. I knew it

784
01:13:24,932 --> 01:13:27,934
You can get a thing, only if you keep repeating that you won't

785
01:13:37,267 --> 01:13:39,514
Is it him? They were searching for you

786
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,307
It's you? Where is the powder?

787
01:14:31,977 --> 01:14:34,107
Fucking whore! I don't like this town.

788
01:14:34,413 --> 01:14:36,129
In morning, they killed the cock

789
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:38,260
Now, they are trying to kill us

790
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:40,506
No respect for aristocrats here

791
01:14:44,941 --> 01:14:46,523
How much to ask?

792
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:48,753
What do you think?

793
01:14:48,753 --> 01:14:50,278
Let us ask ₹100,000

794
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:52,337
Fuck your father! That money won't stick

795
01:14:52,337 --> 01:14:53,990
Why do you want to steal from others?

796
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,746
You are like your mom

797
01:14:55,863 --> 01:14:58,483
How much is our debt? 5000

798
01:14:58,682 --> 01:15:00,172
2000 for the cock

799
01:15:00,336 --> 01:15:02,811
Another 1000 for stay and travel

800
01:15:02,819 --> 01:15:04,829
Let us ask for 8000

801
01:15:04,829 --> 01:15:07,802
Are you really an idiot or just act like one?

802
01:15:25,925 --> 01:15:29,305
Hello, this is Kalaiyaan speaking. The stiff is with me.

803
01:15:29,745 --> 01:15:30,975
Which stuff?

804
01:15:30,975 --> 01:15:33,763
Whiteman's snuff. Bava lodge.

805
01:15:35,086 --> 01:15:37,436
I am by the broken clock tower.

806
01:15:37,436 --> 01:15:40,281
But I got no time. Hurry up.

807
01:15:41,727 --> 01:15:46,929
Green dhoti. Sandal shirt. Blood all over it. A towel

808
01:15:46,929 --> 01:15:48,397
You?

809
01:15:48,506 --> 01:15:51,022
Red Maruti car?

810
01:15:52,988 --> 01:15:56,065
Bring 200,000 with you

811
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:02,567
What do you think now?

812
01:16:24,765 --> 01:16:27,839
Hey Jokers, he is by the broken clock tower

813
01:16:31,094 --> 01:16:34,231
But you have to accept a fact, Kodukkapuli

814
01:16:34,347 --> 01:16:37,062
Your dad is smarter than my dad

815
01:16:47,329 --> 01:16:48,742
Kodukkapuli

816
01:16:48,742 --> 01:16:51,195
We don't know if these folks are good or bad

817
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:53,919
What if they beat us and steal the stuff?

818
01:16:53,919 --> 01:16:57,017
Oh yeah. You are smart for real.

819
01:16:57,178 --> 01:17:00,081
You don't know a lot about your dad

820
01:17:01,485 --> 01:17:03,748
Can you give me the bag?

821
01:17:06,249 --> 01:17:07,826
Let me go hide this bag

822
01:17:07,826 --> 01:17:09,826
If they show up, sternly say it to them..

823
01:17:09,826 --> 01:17:12,492
'Show the money, have the honey'

824
01:17:12,524 --> 01:17:14,904
Kodukkapuli, where are you hiding it?

825
01:17:14,989 --> 01:17:19,186
- I won't tell. You are a blabbermouth
- All of him is poison. (lovingly)

826
01:18:59,751 --> 01:19:02,593
Shit! The chasers at the lodge are in the Maruti car

827
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:11,766
(approaching footsteps)

828
01:19:11,766 --> 01:19:16,061
Dad!

829
01:19:35,955 --> 01:19:38,346
My silver pistol is missing

830
01:19:38,346 --> 01:19:40,577
Did you take it?
(Maruti van door opening)

831
01:19:40,577 --> 01:19:41,977
No

832
01:19:44,832 --> 01:19:47,439
(Van door locking)
I swear, I don't know

833
01:20:08,871 --> 01:20:11,049
Him?

834
01:20:16,463 --> 01:20:20,027
(someone answering a phone call)

835
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:23,506
Do you know English?

836
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:30,143
I got a call that Pasupathy escaped from Mullu

837
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,384
If my guess is right...

838
01:20:43,384 --> 01:20:47,303
Pasupathy will join Gajendran to cause trouble

839
01:20:47,303 --> 01:20:51,417
If not, he will pull his loyal men to create a new gang

840
01:20:51,417 --> 01:20:53,983
I have to ruin it somehow

841
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:56,659
Call Sub-Inspector Mayilvahanan

842
01:20:56,659 --> 01:20:59,519
We have to "leak information" to Gajendran

843
01:20:59,519 --> 01:21:03,519
That bitch won't believe, if it came directly from us

844
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:07,382
'Enemy's enemy is a friend'

845
01:21:07,402 --> 01:21:09,416
.. it is Ayya's mantra

846
01:21:09,946 --> 01:21:12,571
If my guess is right....

847
01:21:13,349 --> 01:21:16,479
Sir, I have to meet Mullu at your police station?

848
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:18,568
Can you arrange that?

849
01:21:18,568 --> 01:21:20,609
Hey, he won't show up

850
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:23,662
Why will Gajendran's man agree to meet Ayya's man?

851
01:21:23,772 --> 01:21:26,682
Tell him it's Pasupathy, he will show up today

852
01:21:29,521 --> 01:21:32,503
- ₹ 2000
- I will pay in the evening

853
01:21:32,892 --> 01:21:36,057
Will you be alive till then?

854
01:21:39,773 --> 01:21:43,263
Hey Gajendran, how much cash do you got at hand?

855
01:21:43,263 --> 01:21:47,263
- What the cunt-hair for?
- I have some good information for you

856
01:22:06,176 --> 01:22:10,176
May I palm read your future ?

857
01:22:10,309 --> 01:22:13,322
I can read the past and the future

858
01:22:14,089 --> 01:22:17,009
I think you don't believe me

859
01:22:17,009 --> 01:22:22,163
Pick 2 flowers, let me palm read only if I get them right

860
01:22:23,493 --> 01:22:25,420
Have you picked them?

861
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:28,281
There are flowers of different kind, color, smell

862
01:22:28,317 --> 01:22:31,205
There is Lily, Lotus, Chrysanthemum and more

863
01:22:31,205 --> 01:22:33,405
But they are not what you picked

864
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:37,110
They are not daisy, water lily, chrysanthemum or ghanera

865
01:22:37,137 --> 01:22:40,315
You thought of a white colored flower

866
01:22:40,315 --> 01:22:42,859
And one in pink color

867
01:22:43,397 --> 01:22:46,184
The two flowers you picked are...

868
01:22:46,185 --> 01:22:48,685
Jasmine and Rose

869
01:22:48,685 --> 01:22:51,028
Is it right, Sir?

870
01:22:58,227 --> 01:23:01,371
What are those two flowers you had picked?

871
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:05,353
Andy Flower and Grant Flower

872
01:23:18,305 --> 01:23:21,118
- What is this shit?
- I told you earlier but no one believed

873
01:23:21,118 --> 01:23:25,318
- He shot at me. But at blank point, he let Mullu live
- I am done with this shit

874
01:23:25,515 --> 01:23:29,515
Gajapathy, this is the station. Can't kill anyone here

875
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:34,828
We saw them meet secretly. Let us hear what Mullu has to say

876
01:24:02,879 --> 01:24:05,050
- Mullu, why are you late?
- It got late

877
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:07,204
Where? At the police station?

878
01:24:11,187 --> 01:24:14,097
- What did you talk about?
- We spoke nothing

879
01:24:14,402 --> 01:24:17,592
- How much did he offer?
- We didn't speak shit

880
01:24:17,702 --> 01:24:21,011
- Why not?
- Because he is a dumb cunt

881
01:24:21,011 --> 01:24:25,011
He had a chance to kill you, why didn't he?

882
01:24:28,937 --> 01:24:30,876
I am asking you

883
01:24:30,876 --> 01:24:33,626
I told you. Can't you understand the first time?

884
01:24:33,626 --> 01:24:35,578
Are you that stupid?

885
01:24:35,748 --> 01:24:39,478
He is paying the cop to meet you. Yet he said nothing?

886
01:24:40,137 --> 01:24:42,669
Because he is a dumb cunt

887
01:24:44,052 --> 01:24:47,694
He took your gun.. had it on your head...

888
01:24:47,694 --> 01:24:51,694
Yet he shot at someone far away and not you?

889
01:24:51,694 --> 01:24:54,594
Because he is a dumb cunt

890
01:24:54,764 --> 01:24:56,221
Mullu...

891
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:59,061
..if I believe it, I am the dumb cunt

892
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:19,021
Do you think this is wrong?

893
01:25:19,021 --> 01:25:23,541
Subbu, worm is eaten by fish, fish is eaten by man. It's life!

894
01:25:23,596 --> 01:25:25,860
When you put it that way

895
01:25:26,076 --> 01:25:28,692
Can we do it right?

896
01:25:29,139 --> 01:25:32,749
Let me repeat our plan. See if it is good

897
01:25:32,749 --> 01:25:36,082
When we go home, Ayya will be in a afternoon nap

898
01:25:36,082 --> 01:25:38,459
Key will be under his pillow.

899
01:25:38,459 --> 01:25:42,459
We will take the safe key out and get the bag

900
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:45,979
Lock it and leave the keys in the same spot Subbu!

901
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:48,223
That's your only responsibility

902
01:25:48,223 --> 01:25:50,447
I will leave the bag at the corner shop

903
01:25:50,447 --> 01:25:53,737
.. and tell him that 'We will get the bag later'

904
01:25:53,737 --> 01:25:56,803
When Ayya wakes up, ask him that you want to see a movie.

905
01:25:56,803 --> 01:26:00,188
Ayya wouldn't let you alone, so he will send me along

906
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:03,018
We will leave as if we are going to movies ...

907
01:26:03,035 --> 01:26:05,504
- ... grab the bag and escape!
- Escape!

908
01:26:18,627 --> 01:26:21,540
Movie is 3 hours. To and fro is 2 hours.

909
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:24,190
For 5 hours, Singaperumal won't look for us

910
01:26:24,845 --> 01:26:27,205
By then, we would be in Andra

911
01:26:28,305 --> 01:26:29,755
- That's all
- Simple

912
01:26:34,267 --> 01:26:36,778
Watch out Subbu, you know nothing

913
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:40,391
You are safe, because I was here

914
01:26:40,911 --> 01:26:44,242
But you are always going to be with me

915
01:26:48,793 --> 01:26:52,793
Did you notice that I called Ayya as 'Singaperumal'?

916
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:57,300
Fear is still there, but braveness has come

917
01:27:46,331 --> 01:27:49,444
(Kaalaiyan crying in pain)

918
01:27:58,338 --> 01:28:00,321
I really don't know

919
01:28:02,163 --> 01:28:03,875
Where?

920
01:28:06,836 --> 01:28:09,819
My son has hid it somewhere

921
01:28:09,819 --> 01:28:12,008
Where is your son?

922
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:17,689
Where is your son?

923
01:28:19,099 --> 01:28:21,194
Where is he now?

924
01:28:21,886 --> 01:28:24,100
Wherever you caught me...

925
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,868
..he is somewhere near by

926
01:28:25,868 --> 01:28:29,019
I don't know where he is now

927
01:28:30,517 --> 01:28:32,181
Let him go

928
01:28:35,107 --> 01:28:38,185
This morning, you killed my fighting cock

929
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:40,945
I didn't take it personally

930
01:28:41,293 --> 01:28:44,502
You didn't care I am an Aristocrat

931
01:28:44,581 --> 01:28:46,535
You beat me up

932
01:28:46,711 --> 01:28:49,566
I didn't take it personally either

933
01:28:50,973 --> 01:28:54,279
But let us stop everything here, OK?

934
01:28:58,665 --> 01:29:00,741
We can stop

935
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,791
But you are not telling me the truth

936
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:07,113
But I told everything I know

937
01:29:09,193 --> 01:29:13,193
(Kaalaiyan crying out in pain)

938
01:29:23,059 --> 01:29:25,761
I am really scared Subbu

939
01:29:25,761 --> 01:29:28,086
What if we mess it up?

940
01:29:29,741 --> 01:29:31,122
Let's drop all of it

941
01:29:31,122 --> 01:29:33,970
Let us not see each other or talk

942
01:29:34,034 --> 01:29:37,060
You are alive, that's enough for me

943
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:39,676
Don't want any of these plans

944
01:29:46,472 --> 01:29:49,922
- Why Subbu?
- Listen to me, no!

945
01:29:49,922 --> 01:29:52,292
If Ayya once....

946
01:29:52,292 --> 01:29:54,224
just once...

947
01:29:54,224 --> 01:29:56,978
...suspects a little bit

948
01:29:57,308 --> 01:30:01,027
I don't care what happens to me, but you...

949
01:30:01,716 --> 01:30:04,259
What were we thinking?

950
01:30:04,259 --> 01:30:05,629
Who is he?

951
01:30:06,249 --> 01:30:08,410
He controls the whole city

952
01:30:09,015 --> 01:30:11,540
We are just some idiots

953
01:30:12,923 --> 01:30:15,543
Let's not do this plan, please

954
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,313
Why Subbu?

955
01:30:17,382 --> 01:30:19,874
Because I really like you

956
01:30:29,517 --> 01:30:31,902
Sorry for everything

957
01:30:43,332 --> 01:30:47,585
Please hug me one last time

958
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:01,015
But I don't like being here

959
01:31:01,651 --> 01:31:03,819
Let us take a risk

960
01:31:03,819 --> 01:31:05,854
Let's escape

961
01:31:05,854 --> 01:31:09,202
- Why?
- Because I like you too

962
01:31:32,537 --> 01:31:33,757
Whore!

963
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:37,757
Beat me now

964
01:31:37,757 --> 01:31:41,542
I got my son.. he will destroy you

965
01:31:47,311 --> 01:31:50,627
What the fuck is this shit?

966
01:32:00,117 --> 01:32:02,200
We can't do anything for sometime

967
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,974
Is it our stuff?

968
01:32:08,517 --> 01:32:12,517
Look at this village idiot's valor

969
01:32:14,506 --> 01:32:17,309
10,000 lost on nothing

970
01:32:17,977 --> 01:32:20,024
Now, where to search for his son?

971
01:33:16,599 --> 01:33:18,568
Why did you take my dad?

972
01:33:18,568 --> 01:33:21,270
We told we were returning the powder

973
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:23,583
Wrong number

974
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:54,091
Hey yellow shirt, the call is for you

975
01:33:59,525 --> 01:34:02,570
- Which powder are you talking about?
- The one in Bava Lodge

976
01:34:03,482 --> 01:34:06,882
- Where is that powder?
- It is with me

977
01:34:06,882 --> 01:34:10,065
- Where are you?
- Let go of my dad, I will tell you

978
01:34:10,726 --> 01:34:14,918
- I don't have your dad
- He spoke to you on phone

979
01:34:14,918 --> 01:34:18,438
- To me? This number?
- Hmm

980
01:34:18,928 --> 01:34:21,998
- Do you have another number?
- Should I call them?

981
01:34:22,506 --> 01:34:24,690
Listen

982
01:34:25,215 --> 01:34:27,930
Don't call them. If you do...

983
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:30,521
...they will take you too

984
01:34:32,126 --> 01:34:35,483
Give the stuff to me, I will save your dad

985
01:34:35,483 --> 01:34:37,916
How do I trust you?

986
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:45,125
Whoever took your dad, took my wife too

987
01:34:47,475 --> 01:34:50,728
Give the stuff to me...I will save your dad

988
01:34:50,728 --> 01:34:53,733
You couldn't keep your wife safe...

989
01:34:53,733 --> 01:34:56,739
..how are you going to save my dad? Cunt-hair!

990
01:34:56,739 --> 01:35:00,560
Motherfucker, then call them. They will take you too.

991
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,190
Do you have any other way?

992
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:05,973
That's why you are calling this number.

993
01:35:06,434 --> 01:35:09,463
I will save him, not for you or your dad

994
01:35:09,463 --> 01:35:13,083
..because I want my wife, that's why

995
01:35:13,083 --> 01:35:15,211
Don't call them

996
01:35:16,172 --> 01:35:18,021
Will you?

997
01:35:18,021 --> 01:35:20,203
I won't

998
01:35:21,588 --> 01:35:23,123
OK.

999
01:35:23,123 --> 01:35:25,719
Come to AK mills at 5

1000
01:35:25,719 --> 01:35:28,317
Do you know where it is?

1001
01:35:29,074 --> 01:35:31,492
It is near by, ask around

1002
01:35:31,492 --> 01:35:33,582
My name is Pasupathy

1003
01:35:33,836 --> 01:35:36,262
I am Kodukkapuli

1004
01:36:03,374 --> 01:36:06,656
What's with the on-time payments?

1005
01:36:07,516 --> 01:36:10,640
What did you speak with Mullu?

1006
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:16,932
It's way more than I want

1007
01:36:16,932 --> 01:36:20,189
I need another help, keep it as advance

1008
01:36:20,189 --> 01:36:22,743
I am listening

1009
01:36:22,743 --> 01:36:25,899
The stuff everyone's looking for... I have it

1010
01:36:26,669 --> 01:36:29,409
I am ready to return it to Ayya..

1011
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:32,049
...instead Kasthuri and a man called 'Kaalaiyan'

1012
01:36:32,049 --> 01:36:33,627
..ask for their release

1013
01:36:33,868 --> 01:36:37,592
I won't cause him trouble, neither should he

1014
01:36:37,592 --> 01:36:40,855
Only you can talk and make him compromise

1015
01:36:41,075 --> 01:36:42,843
Why don't you speak?

1016
01:36:44,196 --> 01:36:46,983
Ask me to beat up 4, I can...

1017
01:36:47,065 --> 01:36:49,891
...I can't think and speak

1018
01:36:49,891 --> 01:36:53,891
I said something this morning and it has gone this far

1019
01:36:55,985 --> 01:36:58,499
I know you can make it happen

1020
01:36:59,929 --> 01:37:02,221
Ok, give me your phone

1021
01:37:04,755 --> 01:37:08,329
Use your phone, I will pay for it

1022
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:10,541
Why are you talking like that?

1023
01:37:23,785 --> 01:37:28,021
At 5:30, Pasupathy will bring the stuff to AK mills

1024
01:37:28,021 --> 01:37:30,216
Go take it

1025
01:37:31,737 --> 01:37:33,264
What?

1026
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:34,626
I am thinking

1027
01:37:34,626 --> 01:37:37,809
What are you thinking? 'Thinking-ka-baal'

1028
01:37:37,809 --> 01:37:40,087
As in, what do with Pasupathy?

1029
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:43,667
Kiss and make out with him

1030
01:37:44,897 --> 01:37:46,961
Go kill him. Leave!

1031
01:37:47,343 --> 01:37:50,380
What do I do with you?

1032
01:37:54,367 --> 01:37:56,986
At least this time, do the job right!

1033
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,191
And don't bring his mom or gradmom this time

1034
01:38:03,843 --> 01:38:05,231
I don't want them

1035
01:38:07,153 --> 01:38:09,375
Go, do it!

Alright, I will buy you tampoons

1043

Call me if Marwari comes. Have to return the cash

1044

I earned this money, don't want to lose it in govt. raids

He is awake, how do we do that?

1046
01:42:36,691 --> 01:42:39,214
The money will be gone when Marwari comes by.

1047
01:42:39,214 --> 01:42:41,320
Before Ayya finishes showering...

1048
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,488
...can you drop off the bag at the shop?

1049
01:42:43,488 --> 01:42:46,018
Please we won't get another chance

1050
01:42:57,652 --> 01:43:00,338
Subbu, pick up the phone

Who?

1052
01:43:12,692 --> 01:43:14,511
Got disconnected

Marvelous

1056
01:43:27,995 --> 01:43:30,774
- Are we OK?
- Take it out

1057
01:43:41,955 --> 01:43:43,512
That's it!

1058
01:43:47,433 --> 01:43:49,405
Hurry up

1059
01:43:51,547 --> 01:43:54,020
What if Ayya asks about me?

1060
01:43:55,976 --> 01:43:58,395
OK. I will make an excuse

1061
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:01,118
Wait a minute

1062
01:44:03,241 --> 01:44:04,855
I am scared

1063
01:44:12,887 --> 01:44:16,388
- Why do we need that?
- Just in case. Keep it

1064
01:44:31,493 --> 01:44:34,906
Keep an eye out. Be careful

1065
01:45:08,787 --> 01:45:11,754
Why are you late? Where is the powder?

1066
01:45:11,754 --> 01:45:13,976
Where is my dad?

1067
01:45:15,075 --> 01:45:18,759
I told you I will get him. Go fetch it. Go!

1068
01:45:20,779 --> 01:45:22,702
I told you. Go get it.

1069
01:45:22,762 --> 01:45:25,639
Show my dad, only then I will give it.

1070
01:45:25,639 --> 01:45:27,924
Is your dad with me?

1071
01:45:29,032 --> 01:45:33,593
Listen. Give me powder. I will exchange that for your dad

1072
01:45:33,593 --> 01:45:36,245
Then why will I give it to you? I will give it to them

1073
01:45:39,159 --> 01:45:43,159
I will kill you.

1074
01:45:43,159 --> 01:45:46,278
Why can't you understand?

1075
01:46:41,012 --> 01:46:45,275
I am gonna trust you. Don't betray me

1076
01:46:46,122 --> 01:46:49,338
- You stay here
- I will come with you

1077
01:46:51,622 --> 01:46:54,252
- Where is my dad?
- These guys are different

1078
01:46:55,585 --> 01:46:59,340
If you trick a little boy, I will murder you and cut you up

1079
01:46:59,437 --> 01:47:03,602
If I don't get my dad, I will murder you. Give the bag, I will take care

1080
01:47:04,867 --> 01:47:07,223
I will get your dad, like I told you

1081

A lot have gone wrong between us

1084
01:47:42,645 --> 01:47:46,464
I will return the goods back to you. Lets not fight

1085
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:49,766
Gajapathy, you get this

1086
01:47:50,313 --> 01:47:53,631
I will explain the problem, you will understand

1087
01:48:01,721 --> 01:48:06,887
- Gajapathy
- First, I will check the goods. We can cut him after

1088
01:49:10,221 --> 01:49:14,300
I wanted to do business, but I messed it up. Sorry!

1089
01:49:38,397 --> 01:49:42,273
Do you ever think before acting? Dumb cunt

1090
01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:46,675
Gajapathy

1091
01:49:49,363 --> 01:49:52,131
There is thin line between Idiot and genius..

1092
01:49:52,131 --> 01:49:54,414
.. I am crossing that line now

1093
01:49:58,316 --> 01:49:59,869
I pissed off Ayya

1094
01:50:00,608 --> 01:50:02,642
But he is a heavy weight

1095
01:50:03,398 --> 01:50:05,665
I can do anything against him alone

1096
01:50:05,895 --> 01:50:08,126
I need another heavy weight for that

1097
01:50:08,126 --> 01:50:10,536
Gajendran is a heavy weight, but..

1098
01:50:10,536 --> 01:50:12,804
..he was pissed off too

1099
01:50:12,804 --> 01:50:17,054
If Gajendran gets psychotic mad, he will annihilate

1100
01:50:17,054 --> 01:50:20,123
But he doesn't get angry like Gajapathy

1101
01:50:20,382 --> 01:50:23,377
I will have to mess with him... to make him do what I need

1102
01:50:23,377 --> 01:50:24,622
Think. Think. Think.

1103
01:50:24,622 --> 01:50:27,021
My first step - Mullu

1104
01:50:27,021 --> 01:50:29,606
Why am I here, if you are not talking? Dumb cunt!

1105
01:50:29,606 --> 01:50:33,350
That triggered Gajendran. Now he is angry

1106
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:35,829
He is not psychotic yet.

1107
01:50:40,514 --> 01:50:44,402
Step 2 - To get Gajendran and Gajapathy with the gang

1108
01:50:44,402 --> 01:50:46,400
... to a place of my choosing

1109
01:50:47,408 --> 01:50:49,508
..you can make it happen..

1110
01:50:50,951 --> 01:50:52,271
Hello Gajendran

1111
01:50:52,751 --> 01:50:56,108
If he said 5:30, we should be there early

1112
01:50:56,513 --> 01:50:59,290
My last step - Gajapathy

1113
01:51:04,967 --> 01:51:08,388
Now... Gajendran is maniac mad

1114
01:51:08,589 --> 01:51:10,835
Anger is blinding his eyes

1115
01:51:38,469 --> 01:51:41,237
Why try so hard to make Gajendran...

1116
01:51:41,237 --> 01:51:44,005
...maniacally mad at me?

1117
01:51:44,455 --> 01:51:45,955
For this!

1118
01:51:46,656 --> 01:51:49,526
Machaa, they are here

1119
01:51:52,308 --> 01:51:55,022
Singaperumal, you son of a whore

1120
01:51:55,144 --> 01:51:58,188
Pasupathy and Singaperumal have been playing me

1121
01:51:58,188 --> 01:51:59,608
Kill them all!

1122
01:51:59,608 --> 01:52:02,517
Why did I believe they will end up fighting?

1123
01:52:02,517 --> 01:52:04,949
Enemy's enemy is a friend. True.

1124
01:52:04,949 --> 01:52:06,592
But more importantly...

1125
01:52:06,592 --> 01:52:09,255
...they both are still enemies

1126
01:54:42,658 --> 01:54:44,026
Subbu...

1127
01:54:44,214 --> 01:54:45,821
Who called?

1128
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:49,365
(kitchen utensils clanging)

1129
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:11,166
Subbu... Sappa...

1130
01:55:17,325 --> 01:55:19,164
Where is the bag?

1131
01:55:20,322 --> 01:55:23,697
Where is Sappa?

1132
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:33,341
I don't know

1133
01:55:40,847 --> 01:55:43,669
Sappa escaped with the bag full of money

1134
01:55:43,669 --> 01:55:45,744
Go. Catch him.

1135
01:55:46,567 --> 01:55:49,322
Sappa ran with the money, find him!

1136
01:56:10,645 --> 01:56:12,461
Where did you go?

1137
01:56:15,049 --> 01:56:17,595
Madam asked to buy fruits

1138
01:56:20,828 --> 01:56:22,743
Where is the money?

1139
01:56:24,883 --> 01:56:27,049
Where is the bag?

1140
01:56:31,117 --> 01:56:34,010
Sappa bitch! Tell me

1141
01:56:34,663 --> 01:56:37,152
Where is the bag?

1142
01:56:44,784 --> 01:56:46,816
Are you looking for this?

1143
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,134
You are trying to kill me?

1144
01:56:58,119 --> 01:57:00,804
You were right to be scared Subbu...

1145
01:58:32,455 --> 01:58:34,672
Did you mess it up Subbu?

1146
01:58:34,672 --> 01:58:36,774
No, I didn't

1147
01:58:39,667 --> 01:58:41,666
Make them cry somehow...

1148
01:58:41,666 --> 01:58:44,173
..make your move when consoling..

1149
01:58:48,302 --> 01:58:50,459
What if we steal from our Ayya?

1150
01:58:50,459 --> 01:58:53,157
I am scared Subbu

1151
01:58:53,157 --> 01:58:55,097
If we mess it up?

1152
01:58:55,097 --> 01:58:57,391
Lets drop all plans

1153
01:58:57,391 --> 01:59:00,265
- Lets risk it Subbu
- Why?

1154
01:59:00,265 --> 01:59:03,082
Because I like you too

1155
01:59:05,894 --> 01:59:07,785
Just in case. Keep it

1156
01:59:32,391 --> 01:59:35,104
Machi.... I have seduced atleast 100 MILFs

1157
01:59:35,104 --> 01:59:37,741
Out of them... 3 have tricked me

1158
01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:39,890
This is a 'sappa matter'

1159
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:42,807
We all would think that he was a common person...

1160
01:59:42,807 --> 01:59:44,806
... but Rajini was Baashaa, the don

1161
01:59:44,806 --> 01:59:46,989
What a fucking Joker!

1162
02:00:42,378 --> 02:00:44,415
Sappa shot Ayya?

1163
02:00:46,528 --> 02:00:48,786
So you killed Sappa for that?

1164
02:00:54,532 --> 02:00:56,985
You have suffered a lot here..

1165
02:00:56,985 --> 02:00:58,716
Leave

1166
02:01:00,276 --> 02:01:02,890
I will take care. Leave

1167
02:01:28,671 --> 02:01:30,187
Ayya, tell me

1168
02:01:30,187 --> 02:01:33,003
This is not Ayya....Pasupathy

1169
02:01:35,216 --> 02:01:37,337
Singaperumal tried to kill me

1170
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:40,670
Now, he is not alive

1171
02:01:41,583 --> 02:01:43,481
I killed Gajendran

1172
02:01:43,541 --> 02:01:45,281
Killed Gajapathy

1173
02:01:45,799 --> 02:01:47,682
Nagaraj is out of picture too

1174
02:01:48,607 --> 02:01:50,392
Now on, it's just me

1175
02:01:51,333 --> 02:01:53,811
I know you did this for Ayya

1176
02:01:53,811 --> 02:01:55,786
I am not angry at you

1177
02:01:58,967 --> 02:02:01,726
But, Kasthuri needs to be here... now

1178
02:02:15,657 --> 02:02:17,342
Take him to the hospital

1179
02:02:44,239 --> 02:02:47,011
- Do you like you dad so much?
- Not like that

1180
02:02:47,011 --> 02:02:49,046
But he is my dad

1181
02:03:21,501 --> 02:03:23,557
Had any problem?

1182
02:03:38,279 --> 02:03:40,415
What happened to the money?

1183
02:03:41,115 --> 02:03:43,034
Only Sappa knows

1184
02:03:43,034 --> 02:03:44,863
That dog is dead now

1185
02:03:54,634 --> 02:03:56,912
Thank you so much

1186
02:03:56,951 --> 02:04:00,142
- How is Ayya doing?
- He is very good

1187
02:04:21,787 --> 02:04:23,917
Someone who will listen to me

1188
02:04:23,917 --> 02:04:25,956
Someone to blame for the money

1189
02:04:25,956 --> 02:04:27,637
I needed an Idiot for that

1190
02:04:27,637 --> 02:04:29,121
He was Sappa

1191
02:04:29,121 --> 02:04:32,084
Otherwise, there is nothing about how he is innocent

1192
02:04:32,084 --> 02:04:33,929
Just like he said...

1193
02:04:33,929 --> 02:04:37,789
'Worm, fish, man...life is like that'

1194
02:04:37,789 --> 02:04:40,333
To me, Sappa is just man.

1195
02:04:40,333 --> 02:04:42,975
All men are sappa(nothing) too

1196
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:55,788
Watch out Subbu, you know nothing

1197
02:05:02,151 --> 02:05:05,135
You are safe, because I was here

1198
02:05:05,410 --> 02:05:07,050
Idiot

1199
02:05:28,955 --> 02:05:31,374
NagaDutta : Vishnugupta, what is dharma?

1200
02:05:31,374 --> 02:05:35,342
Vishnugupta Chankya : Dharma is doing what is necessary

1201
