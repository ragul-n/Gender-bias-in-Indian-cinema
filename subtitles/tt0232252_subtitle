00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,440
Aye Kariya, why did you stop the cart?

23
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,560
See there, Sundarakka is coming

24
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,800
Why should you stop the cart if she comes? you slave dog

25
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,320
Why do you say so?

26
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,160
Whenever you saw Sundarakka, even before I stopped the cart, you used to jump down and go to her?

27
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,600
So I stopped the cart myself today. Did I do anything wrong?

28
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,840
Shut your mouth

29
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,520
Sahukara (Sir), Sahukara

30
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,480
I'm going to be mother to your child

31
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,280
Kariya, start moving the cart

32
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,720
Sahukara, you swore over the village goddess that you'll marry me.

33
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,560
By accepting me, preserve my honour amongst our people.

34
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,760
Sundari... Sahukar Sangappa is like Sriramachandra (Lord Ram)

35
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,680
Only one wife all through my life

36
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,320
I've promised my wife like that when she's dying.

37
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,640
If I marry you now, will her soul rest in peace?

38
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,760
Shiva, Shiva, not at all.

39
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,400
Sahukara, why are you talking like this today?

40
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,040
What happens of me who trusted your words these many days?

41
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,880
Sundari...

42
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,440
Take and keep this.

43
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,520
If you want more money, come to me secretly, I'll give.

44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,960
I don't want money, my lord.

45
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Give me my honour.

46
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,760
don't dishonour me my lord...

47
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,760
What happens to my honour if I marry you? Go go.

48
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,920
Sahukara... Go now...

49
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,560
Sahukara, don't leave me.

50
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,080
Kariya, give me that whip. Give it now.

51
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,760
Akka (elder sister)...

52
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
What did the Sahukara say?

53
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,280
What did he say, akka?

54
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:00,920
Don't fall off dozing my brother, O foolish brother

55
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:09,280
Don't fall off dozing my brother, O foolish brother

56
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:17,440
My grandpa, your grandpa and all our forefathers fell by dozing off.

57
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:25,520
Don't fall off dozing my brother, O foolish brother

58
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,080
Thinking letters of sugar (learning) as bitter

59
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Throwing off books like waste

60
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:59,280
Thinking letters of sugar (learning) as bitter... Throwing off books like waste

61
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,240
Keeping hands over heads...

62
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,160
Keeping hands over heads... and blaming everything on fate...

63
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:15,280
My grandpa, your grandpa and all our forefathers fell by dozing off.

64
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:49,360
For a little soup, a piece of cloth, they placed their throats between the scissors of slavery.

65
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
Wandered aimlessly while suffering

66
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,640
Wandered aimlessly while suffering like living dead bodies.

67
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:06,240
My grandpa, your grandpa and all our forefathers fell by dozing off.

68
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,360
Open your eyes to face this life.

69
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,640
Don't cower for threats and become a slave

70
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:37,320
Open your eyes to face this life... Don't cower for threats and become a slave...

71
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,160
Like worms living off sewers...

72
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,840
Don't become blind like worms living off sewers...

73
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:53,920
Don't fall off dozing my brother, O foolish brother

74
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:02,400
My grandpa, your grandpa and all our forefathers fell by dozing off.

75
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:10,080
Don't fall off dozing my brother, O foolish brother.

76
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,640
My brother, O foolish brother.

77
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,280
Lakshmi.

78
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Anna (Elder brother)... come brother come.

79
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,440
Come sit down brother.

80
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,640
I have no time to sit down.

81
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,880
Tell your son to take this letter and go to Mysore. I've told them everything.

82
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,040
They'll definitely give a job.

83
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,000
Anyway, it's good if you mother and son get settled in town and live happily.

84
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,520
That's all we need. You'll have brought light to your sister's life.

85
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,800
What's there in this cursed village?

86
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,640
There's no proper shelter or means to survive.

87
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,400
Who made us live like that? It's you, aren't you?

88
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,000
Ramanna... no

89
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,320
Cunningly hogging up all my mother's money, now you've come like a jackal?

90
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,880
Do you see how your son's arrogance?

91
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,640
Keep quiet mother. By tempting us with a job, 
you want to send us off from village?

92
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,600
Come what may, we won't leave this village.

93
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,200
Lakshmi, don't blame me anymore.

94
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,080
Don't come seeking anything to my doorsteps.

95
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,680
Hey Uncle, who'll come to your door?

96
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,760
Even if we die starving, I won't send my mother to your door.

97
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,360
Let's go mother.

98
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,680
Amma, Shankaranna came.

99
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Aye Shankaranna... What my monkey?

100
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you doing well?... Amma, see how he calls me a monkey.

101
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,000
No, no... It's Mangala. My brilliant little sister.

102
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,000
Did you bring snow, powder and other things I asked for?

103
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,120
They're not just for you. I've brought for your husband too.

104
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,000
You're miffed if I talk about your husband? Shankaru..

105
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Are you well?... Yes mother... How have you done in your exams?

106
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,640
I've done okay.

107
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,760
Will you pass?...   Pass?

108
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,200
Maybe...

109
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,440
Is that corner field harvested yet?

110
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,000
It's done.

111
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,680
How much paddy did we get?

112
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
It's done.

113
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,640
But not one grain was brought home.

114
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,480
Meaning?

115
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Don't you know your father's habits?

116
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,840
He gave it all up by losing a bet against that Sahukara.

117
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,840
Shankaru.

118
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,680
Have you seen or heard anywhere losing grains over betting debts?

119
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,600
Your father won't leave that until he brings us all to streets. He won't leave.

120
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,960
Sahukara won't disregard your words.

121
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,480
So, what do you want me to do?

122
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,760
Put in a word for me.

123
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,560
Please help me set right my life.

124
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,000
Eh, tart.

125
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,200
I know all your games.

126
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,640
Sahukara has a lot of wealth.

127
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
has a lot of money.

128
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,840
By becoming his wife, you scheme to control everything, is it?

129
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,600
Eh, go, go now... You whore.

130
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,240
What did you call my sister?

131
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,960
You have grown courage to raise hands against this Connection Kaalappa now?

132
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,040
Why did you come begging him?

133
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Let's go brother. Let's ask the Sahukara.

134
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,240
Appa (Father)

135
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,080
When did you come back?

136
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,560
Get up.

137
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,760
Even after asking you to leave these cursed cards 
so many times, you won't listen to us, will you?

138
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
Don't you have shame in life?

139
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,840
You won't rest until you've given up everything to these people, do you?

140
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,960
Shankara.

141
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
If you give something to Sahukara...

142
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,840
I'll kick you in the chest.

143
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,640
If you hold these cards in your hands again...

144
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll kick you in the chest.

145
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,360
What did you say son? You'll kick me in the chest?

146
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Come, come I say... Eh Shankara...

147
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,680
Go.

148
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,160
Look at him Sahukara.

149
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,400
Son whom I gave birth to wants to kick me in the chest.

150
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,160
[Laughing] Mylari...

151
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,360
You're father to him...

152
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,200
Or he's father to you? I have doubts now.

153
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Hey kid, he comes here for about half hour to relieve his boredom. Is that wrong?

154
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,240
Yes, you people play to pass time and my father plays to lose everything.

155
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,680
Eh, get up father...  
Leave me be..

156
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,120
My wealth should all go to Sahukara...

157
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,320
or...

158
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,040
Sahukara's wealth should all come to me.

159
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,880
Until then...

160
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,280
I'll keep playing this game with Sahukara...

161
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,400
I have determined like that.

162
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,680
That is how a determined speaks...

163
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,040
How weak hearted your son is...

164
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,000
Eh Shankara...

165
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,360
You've grown so arrogant as to spit in front of me?

166
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,960
I'm letting you go because you're Mylari's son.

167
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
If it was someone else...

168
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,640
I'd have got their tongues split.

169
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,880
Sahukara, don't let him go because he's my son.

170
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,520
If he ever turns against you, he's no more my son.

171
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,840
Sahukara.

172
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,680
Why do you come?

173
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,200
Sahukara, what about my sister?

174
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,840
Why do you ask me?

175
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,440
How can you say like that?

176
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
The child in her womb...

177
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,000
isn't it yours?

178
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,960
Who said so?

179
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,640
If a village has a street, everyone walks on it...

180
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,960
I could've walked it like everyone..

181
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,760
If you accuse that all the footsteps belongs to one, how can that be?

182
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,920
Will anyone agree?

183
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,960
They'll beat you up... Go go.

184
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Sahukara.

185
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,880
People like us shouldn't live in this wretched world, akka.

186
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,320
We'll jump into a lake or well.

187
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,360
Eh Maacha.

188
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,040
Why do you jump into a well?

189
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,560
If you want to die, die hanging yourselves
 in front of that Sahukara's house.

190
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,920
Who's it wanting to die all over again?

191
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Ramanna, come. Come here.

192
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
What's it Shankara?

193
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,820
What's all this?

194
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,520
These people are going off to die.

195
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,840
O, you people think you're still alive?

196
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,560
Only two people live in this village.

197
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,560
One is that Sahukara..

198
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,080
Another one...[pointing to Connection Kaalappa there]

199
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,360
Everyone else is

200
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,080
just breathing dead bodies.

201
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,640
Ramanna... Sahukara did this to my sister...

202
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,920
I know..

203
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,880
My mother... born after him...

204
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,520
when he can cheat her, who else will matter to him?

205
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,850
You want to die huh? Let's go.

206
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,320
If I sit closing my eyes...

207
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,120
I can see only you, O Shiva...

208
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,240
I can see only you

209
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,680
If I sit closing my eyes...

210
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:20,600
I can see only you, O Shiva... I can see only you

211
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,960
When I open my eyes and see...

212
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:40,360
I see hundred more like you, O Shiva...

213
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,520
I placed you first in all my offerings...

214
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,080
I saw hundreds of hungry stomachs in that plate of offering...

215
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:21,640
When will those stomachs see plates filled with rice...O Shiva...

216
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,080
plates filled with rice...

217
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,880
You wear all the nice clothes offered to you...

218
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,600
In those clothes I saw poor wearing torn pieces of clothes.

219
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:06,560
When will those bodies see nice clothes...O Shiva...

220
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,400
nice clothes...

221
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,920
You sit quietly in your temple...

222
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,280
You've forgotten those who don't have a roof...

223
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:50,560
When will those godlike people have their warm shelter...O Shiva...

224
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,040
their warm shelter...

225
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,200
If I sit closing my eyes...

226
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:08,600
I can see only you, O Shiva... I can see only you

227
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,200
When I open my eyes and see...

228
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:33,520
I see hundred more like you, O Shiva...

229
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,640
Come..

230
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,120
Come...

231
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,200
Let Shiva bless everyone...

232
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,000
Shankara, how's your studies going on?

233
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,120
With your grace everything's fine.

234
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,520
Ramanna

235
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,120
Why is it you all have come here together? What's the matter?

236
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,600
Why are you so dull?

237
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,080
Tell me what is it?

238
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,440
Sundaravva.

239
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,440
Why are there tears in your eyes?

240
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,960
What happened?

241
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,160
In a village where good people like you reside...

242
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,160
we are doubtful whether Dharma exists or not...

243
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,240
Dharma holds more value or a wealthy man
 holds more value, we can't understand...

244
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,040
People who believe in justice and morals...

245
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
are worse than a dog, Buddhi (guru)?

246
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,920
In our village...

247
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
Who did injustice to you?

248
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,000
Tell me... I shall ask...

249
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,840
Buddhi, in our village...

250
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,600
He who believes village is only him and ...

251
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,040
he's the village...

252
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,600
our Sahukara, goes about blowing his own trumpet...

253
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,320
Kaalappa, I heard, yesterday, Mylari's son Shankara came to your house?

254
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,800
said, 'Sahukara's like this, like that, we should break his teeth...'?

255
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,080
he lectured you saying all that?

256
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,880
and you were all nodding in agreement?

257
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,960
Is that true?

258
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,760
Who has the courage to talk ill of god like you and still live?

259
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,040
Which rascal told you that?

260
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,240
Oye, I told him.

261
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,880
Am I a rascal?

262
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,440
What you say Shankarappa said is right...

263
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,680
You only listened to his part...

264
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,240
Do you know what happened after that?

265
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,920
I've scolded him such that he wouldn't dare talk about you again.

266
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,760
Sahukara, Swamiji (guru) sent for you.

267
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,280
You are to come immediately.

268
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Is it so? Tell him I'm on my way.

269
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,160
Look here.

270
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,880
If I hear anything of this sort again...

271
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,520
those who talk, those who hear, both will be taken care of.

272
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,680
Go Go.

273
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,520
Sahukara

274
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Didn't you say you needed planks for your attic floor?

275
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,920
Cut down this tree..

276
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,360
It will make more planks than needed.

277
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,800
What are you talking Kaalappa?

278
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,440
Does anyone cut down a tree in front of monastery?

279
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,840
Doesn't it give shade to all those who visit?

280
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,600
Eh. Shut up.

281
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,120
You son of a slave.

282
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,320
What's the connection between a tree and monastery?

283
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Is this tree more valuable to you than our Sahukara's house?

284
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,200
Kaalappa...

285
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,360
You're my loyal friend.

286
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,000
But this slave doesn't have that loyalty.

287
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Give me that coconut.

288
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,360
[Taking Shiva's different names]

289
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,720
Eh, sit down.

290
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,840
Sit down.

291
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,600
Eh Sundarakka, why are you standing? Sit down.

292
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,880
Eh, sit down I say.

293
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
When some big man like our Sahukara comes...

294
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,440
you shouldn't stand. You should sit.

295
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,760
That's the respect he deserves.

296
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,880
Shiva... Buddhi Sahukara has come.

297
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Guru, I fall at your feet.

298
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
How are you?

299
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,360
It's all your grace.

300
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
You sent for me?

301
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,920
I've come.

302
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,160
Yes, Sahukara.

303
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,920
I wanted to talk something important with you.

304
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
That's why I sent for you.

305
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,920
Did I cause any trouble?

306
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Shiva, Shiva. Trouble?

307
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,080
How is it a trouble to come to our own monastery? Shiva, Shiva.

308
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,760
Sahukara.

309
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
You're a big man in this village.

310
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,320
living with Dharma and justice...

311
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,240
you should be setting example for others.

312
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,400
When you walk the wrong path...

313
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,720
how can we advise others?

314
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Buddhi..

315
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,480
what you're talking...

316
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,040
and why you have called our Sahukara...

317
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,360
can't seem to understand what the connection is.

318
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Sundaravva.

319
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,760
Sahukara.

320
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,200
I've come to know about the relations you had with Sundaravva.

321
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,720
It's your duty to keep the promise you gave her.

322
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,280
That is Dharma.

323
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
Did you see Kaalappa?

324
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,640
These rascals, joining together,

325
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,560
have created such a drama here?

326
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
We are not the rascals.

327
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,360
You've done what's worthy of a rascal.

328
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Call yourself that.

329
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
What's this?

330
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,520
You made me a loafer in front of Buddhi?

331
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Buddhi.

332
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,760
This woman and I...

333
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,720
I swear on you, your holy feet...

334
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,240
I swear on Shiva, there's no relation.

335
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,400
Yes Buddhi, there's no connection at all.

336
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,080
Buddhi..

337
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,400
Listening to these beggars...

338
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,480
listening to these rascals...

339
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,160
listening to this whore... 
Sahukara

340
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,920
Sahukara?

341
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,120
This is a holy place.

342
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,920
Mind your tongue when you're talking.

343
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,640
See...

344
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,600
you keep the promise you gave this woman,

345
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,520
that's when you'll have your honour.

346
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,280
In my private matters...

347
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,280
if you don't get involved...

348
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,280
you'll keep your honour too.

349
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:55,760
If you understand that you were placed in this holy place by us and others...

350
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,200
you'll have long life.

351
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,280
come Kaalappa.

352
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:13,280
Sahukara... 
Kariya...

353
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,200
If you two ever touch Sahukara...

354
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
he'll call me...

355
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,240
Kariya... beat these two, he'll say...

356
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,080
I'm in his debt...

357
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,680
I can't say no.

358
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,720
I'll beat you two definitely.

359
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
One strike...

360
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
and you'll be dead...

361
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,360
Don't... don't do it my brothers...

362
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,240
Maacha, please take this Kencha with you...

363
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,080
Don't have anything to do with him..

364
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,320
Go... Go brother...

365
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,640
Go... Eh go now...

366
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,280
Sahukara will marry me...

367
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,360
Sahukara will definitely marry me...

368
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
he won't cheat me..

369
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
he won't cheat me...

370
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,840
Akka.

371
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,760
Sahukara will marry me.

372
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,760
definitely he'll marry me.

373
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,800
you bring all the jewels and prepare for marriage. He'll marry me...

374
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,040
Hey, there's marriage between the Sahukara and me.

375
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:09,200
You all must come. Sahukar and I are getting married...

376
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,960
Sahukara and I are getting married.

377
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
You all must come.

378
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Sahukara and I are getting married.

379
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,040
You all must come.

380
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Leave me... Akka... Leave me...

381
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,040
Sahukara is calling me, let me go... Anna (elder brother)

382
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,920
Our akka has gone mad... mad...

383
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Ramanna.

384
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,760
Finally Sahukara...

385
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,480
took Sundarakka's life...

386
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
with a disdain for Dharma...

387
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
sinner isn't he?

388
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,080
We shouldn't let him go on like this.

389
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,240
Not him...

390
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,200
We should first destroy his fiefdom

391
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,000
Why did you come to this wretched man's house? Why?

392
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,240
Son... there was nothing left in the house.

393
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,160
Instead of losing shame by asking others...

394
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,320
whatever may be, he's my brother born of the same blood.

395
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,280
Thinking if at all I lose shame, let me lose it here, I came and asked.

396
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,680
He's given me two measures of rice.

397
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,760
If you had begged in the streets..

398
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,560
I won't have considered it shame.

399
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,720
One who cheated you of your property...

400
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,360
your brother's colour...

401
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,280
can't you still see?

402
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Throw that.. throw.

403
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,600
Leave it... Leave it...

404
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,400
This is not rice for us..

405
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,000
poison, poison.

406
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:11,560
How old are you now? My golden girl, our village beauty.

407
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,120
My age is now to rock the cradle, my dear, our village hero.

408
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,840
How old are you now? My golden girl, our village beauty.

409
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:33,080
My age is now to rock the cradle, my dear, our village hero.

410
00:30:47,120 --> 00:31:06,080
Even though many from all over asked for my hand, I have strong desire for your hand in marriage.

411
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:15,080
day or night, it's your name I keep thinking of.

412
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:24,520
This love of yours has joined in me and charmed me.

413
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,560
How old are you now? My golden girl, our village beauty.

414
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:39,480
My age is now to rock the cradle, my dear, our village hero.

415
00:31:52,840 --> 00:32:11,520
At this time of harvest, greenery blooms, it's your warm breath that fills everywhere.

416
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:20,640
For a heart filled with dreams, desires are numerous.

417
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:30,080
You trouble me wherever I go, you are my sugar and milk.

418
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,200
How old are you now? My golden girl, our village beauty.

419
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:44,880
My age is now to rock the cradle, my dear, our village hero.

420
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:22,120
All your mischief, a thing of enjoyment and I feel elated when I see you.

421
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:31,240
At an age full of spirits, heart desires our marriage.

422
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:40,440
Acting like you disagree, you come running to wed me. You're my peacock.

423
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:47,520
How old are you now? My golden girl, our village beauty.

424
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:54,400
My age is now to rock the cradle, my dear, our village hero.

425
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,160
How old are you now?

426
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
No, no. I won't tell.

427
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,080
How old are you now?

428
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
I don't know. Leave me.

429
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,960
I'll keep driving Sahukara's cart.

430
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,320
I suddenly remember you.

431
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,640
As if you came, danced in my heart...

432
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,000
where would be my senses or the cart...

433
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,920
where would I be?... Eh, Kariya.

434
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,440
Put my daughter down...

435
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,040
Kariya.

436
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,560
Stop there. Stop.

437
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,920
What man?

438
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,200
You try to flirt with my daughter?

439
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,960
Is it any wrong to talk to the girl I'd marry?

440
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,680
Marriage? What did you say?

441
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
Chennavva, come here.

442
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,520
My daughter whose colour is like a bright palm flower...

443
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,480
how do I give her hand to you who looks like a ripe banana leaf?

444
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,040
Uncle

445
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,600
Palm flower...

446
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,400
when it dries, it's just like ripe banana leaves.

447
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,640
Eh... Yes father.

448
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,040
You keep quiet. You don't know anything.

449
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
Kariya.

450
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,360
If you want to marry my daughter...

451
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,800
one condition.

452
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,080
What is it?

453
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:09,640
You bring a gold coin necklace for my daughter...

454
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,440
we'll talk about the marriage then.

455
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,640
What sort of condition is this?

456
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,360
gold coin necklace?

457
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
How can I get it?

458
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,160
Me... Just a slave of that Sahukara...

459
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,480
A nobody who's surviving as slave labour...

460
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,920
has no father or mother...

461
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,480
I'm an orphan.

462
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,680
Where will I get it?

463
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,680
A gold coin necklace?

464
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,200
I get so angry over her father...

465
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,800
makes me strike him a blow...

466
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
This wretched hand.

467
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,520
If I put this hand over him, he'll be dead, Shankarappa.

468
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,480
That's why I'm quiet fearing that.

469
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
I don't know what to do.

470
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,000
Kariya, do one thing.

471
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,200
What do I do?

472
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,680
Do you know what Arjuna did in Mahabharata?

473
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,240
How would I know what he did?

474
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
He loved Subhadra.

475
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,520
He eloped with her.

476
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,000
In the same way, you too elope with her.

477
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,280
What are you talking Shankarappa?

478
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,120
Just because he eloped, should I follow him?

479
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,720
Will our villagers let me live?

480
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,440
Will I have any honour?

481
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,600
You seem to think I'm like my Sahukara.

482
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,040
Kariya.

483
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,720
Your Sahukara doesn't have morals as much as you.

484
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,440
He made Sundarakka go crazy.

485
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,120
I don't have anything to do with elder's business.

486
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,120
I want my Chenni to come and a gold coin necklace. Tell me what to do for that.

487
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,480
Hmm. Come.

488
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,600
Sahukara.

489
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,880
What is it Kariya?

490
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,400
There's nothing...

491
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,680
I... I...

492
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,880
One girl...
Did you rape her?

493
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,200
Shiva, shiva. What sort of things do you speak?

494
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,640
It's not that.

495
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,760
I...

496
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,480
am loving a girl.

497
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,040
Have decided to marry her.

498
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,360
You illiterate fool.

499
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,720
You have been with me these many years..

500
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,520
Didn't you understand this much?

501
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,840
Meaning?

502
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,920
Hey, you should love girls...

503
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,360
but shouldn't marry them.

504
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,720
Hey Kariya.

505
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,320
Would anyone wash and take home the banana leaf they eat on at village feasts?

506
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,080
Eat off it, throw it and go your way.

507
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,600
What are you talking?

508
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,560
The Chenni I love is silver plate.

509
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,720
She's not the leaf one throws away after one's eaten.

510
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,000
What do you want from me now?

511
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
Nothing.

512
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,560
The girl's father says..

513
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,120
the marriage will happen only when I give a gold coin necklace.

514
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,520
If not he said he wouldn't give her hand in marriage.

515
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,000
Sahukara, please get a gold coin necklace done for me.

516
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,760
I'll marry my Chenni.

517
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,480
Yes yes. Your father has left me with a fortune...

518
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,240
to make a gold necklace for your marriage.

519
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,240
Get lost.

520
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,600
But...

521
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,800
But I was told my money is with you.

522
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,200
Which fool told you so?

523
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,560
That Shankarappa told me so.

524
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,360
What did he say?

525
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,440
Tell me what he said.

526
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,200
He said...

527
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,600
"For 20 years, you've been doing labour for your Sahukara..."

528
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,960
"except food twice a day..."

529
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,320
"has he given you any wage,"

530
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:56,480
"that mongrel who calls himself your boss?"

531
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,200
"Haven't you toiled?"

532
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:07,400
He said, "Slap him on his face and ask for a gold coin necklace"

533
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:18,160
I haven't asked for a penny for these 20 years, how can I ask for a gold necklace suddenly? I said.

534
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,160
"Why do you fear so much,"

535
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
"you scared son of a coward,"

536
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,480
"is there dearth of money with that despicable man?"

537
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,200
"When he dies, would he take all the money with him?"

538
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,240
he said many such things.

539
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
So I said to him...

540
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,840
Hey Shankarappa...

541
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,400
don't talk ill of my master in front of me. It won't be good for you.

542
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,120
I've told him like that.

543
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,440
Sahukara.

544
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,600
Please get a gold coin necklace and let this marriage happen.

545
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,920
My wife and I, till we die...

546
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,480
will be slaves to you for our life.

547
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,200
No gold necklace..

548
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,280
not even a damn penny.

549
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,800
Get lost, you scoundrel.

550
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,000
Sahukara

551
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,360
You had Tavarekere Thimmi in your farm house...

552
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,920
you gave her 500 rupees.

553
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,000
To Rangamma of Rampura...

554
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,120
for only one night...

555
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,560
you gave her 1000 rupees.

556
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,680
For 20 years I've been slaving under you...

557
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,880
this orphan...

558
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,400
is worth less than them?

559
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
You fool.

560
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,320
The enjoyment you get with one bottle of brandy...

561
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,880
would a big vessel of water give you that?

562
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,120
Brandy's worth is different, a vessel of water's worth is different.

563
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,520
Don't talk nonsense now and go do your job.

564
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
Sahukara.

565
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,520
I've promised Chenni that I'll marry her.

566
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,840
Is it Dharma to forget those promises given to a trusting girl?

567
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,480
Is it justice, Sahukara?

568
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,240
Go throw your Dharma and justice in dump.

569
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,440
Sahukara.

570
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,040
You may have deceived Sundarakka...

571
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,440
promised her and spoilt her life...

572
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,800
and threw justice and Dharma in the dump.

573
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,560
But I can't do so.

574
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,560
I can't do so.

575
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,200
Sahukara.

576
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,960
I want gold necklace.

577
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,920
I want gold coin necklace.

578
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,680
Give me money.

579
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,880
Give me money...

580
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,040
Give me money.

581
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,320
You thankless bastard.

582
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,480
You bring up Sundari's matter and taunt me?

583
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,920
[Cursing]

584
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,920
You slave dog...
Sahukara.

585
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,160
Only one strike with this hand...

586
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,160
and you won't survive.

587
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,560
Just because you've given me food...

588
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
I'm going quietly.

589
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,800
Hey Rudra.

590
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,680
Go bring that town crier.

591
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,520
Hey what happened?

592
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,080
What happened? Didn't Sahukara give you money for the necklace?

593
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,520
What are you talking?

594
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,000
He gave. He gave a handful.

595
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,320
See here.

596
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,320
Oh my god.

597
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,800
They've beaten my dear like cattle.

598
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Shankarappa.

599
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,080
What is it Chenni?

600
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,040
Sahukara has beaten Kariya like cattle.

601
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,160
He's lying at the well crying.

602
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,680
Hey Kariya.

603
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,640
What happened? Tell us what happened.

604
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,400
Shankarappa, I listened to you

605
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,480
and asked Sahukara for necklace.

606
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,240
He's given me, see. Long necklaces on my back.

607
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,680
You keep saying that your one strike will take life of a man.

608
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,400
Couldn't you've struck him then and there?

609
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,240
You coward.

610
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,240
You aren't as much brave as her.

611
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,520
You fat idiot.

612
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,880
When he was beating you, were you holding butter in your hands?

613
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
What are you people talking?

614
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Sundarakka.

615
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,160
Kariya.

616
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,840
Did Sahukara give you gold necklace?

617
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,480
Let me see them.

618
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,960
Our Sahukara...

619
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,120
gave Kariya a gold necklace.

620
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,960
Our Sahukara gave gold necklace to Kariya.

621
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,800
Siddappa, Sahukar has given gold necklace to Kariya.

622
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,200
Hear ye, hear ye.

623
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,240
All the villagers hear.

624
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,200
Our Sahukara's slave Kariya

625
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,360
has disrespected and hit our Sahukara.

626
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,680
To Kariya, in this village...

627
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:57,680
no one is to give any food or water. So orders our Sahukara.

628
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,920
Those who violate this...

629
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,240
will be banished from the village.

630
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,320
Why are you taking my drum?
Hey kariya, come here.

631
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,080
Leave my drum, I'll tell Sahukara.

632
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,000
Kaalappa.

633
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,360
Seems like these beggars have come begging.

634
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,600
Shall we give them anything?

635
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,160
Sahukara.

636
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,520
Without calling village council, without investigating...

637
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,920
To our Kariya, in this village...

638
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,440
no one is to give food or water...

639
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,640
Who gave you the right to have it announced like that in the village?

640
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,120
Why would anyone give him that right?

641
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,600
He is Paduvaarahalli.

642
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,720
Paduvaarahalli is him.

643
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,400
Village council is him and he is the village council.

644
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,200
For this Paduvaarahalli...

645
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
whatever he says is justice.

646
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,640
whatever he says is law.

647
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,920
You son of a slave.

648
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,520
Bringing all these useless scoundrels,

649
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,520
you challenge me?

650
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,680
Uncle, wherever there's injustice,

651
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,640
we will challenge it.

652
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,920
Kaalappa.
Ha?
These kids...

653
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,720
are saying they'll challenge me.

654
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,080
Who's behind our Sahukara...

655
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,440
what all kind of people are behind him...

656
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,440
where are they all...

657
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,760
How they are, you have any idea?

658
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:21,600
Came here beating that good for nothing drum... beating to, to, to

659
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,360
We have a very big drum.

660
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,680
If we beat that drum once, it'll be like typhoon.

661
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,880
In that, dry leaves like you will be thrown far off.

662
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,680
You beat whatever big drum you want to beat.

663
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,360
We'll keep on beating our drum.

664
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,200
Mangala, mangala.

665
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,920
What is it brother?
Bring some water

666
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,440
Today Kariya will eat at our home. Go tell mother.

667
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,960
Amma, amma.

668
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:56,960
Appa (father)

669
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,600
From today, Kariya will stay with us,

670
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,680
will be with me.

671
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,840
Hey, first send him off from here.

672
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,160
He'll feed him food?

673
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,680
Appa, I won't send him back.

674
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,520
If you won't, I will.

675
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,120
Hey get lost...
Appa.

676
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,360
Shankara.

677
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,040
If Sahukara marks a line here...

678
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,960
and says not to cross it, the village doesn't dare to cross it.

679
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,080
Yes, Sahukara...

680
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,920
says leave all your women and children, will you leave them?

681
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,120
We'll do so.

682
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:32,640
Do you think there're only sheep in this village to
 obey whatever your Sahukara says?

683
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,640
Keep seeing.

684
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,520
The whole village should turn against him.

685
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,320
I'll make it happen.

686
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,720
Let's go Kariya.

687
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,720
Everybody stop.

688
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,680
Stop working in the fields.

689
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,880
Stop it.

690
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,520
See here.

691
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,680
See what your Sahukara has to Kariya.

692
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,320
Today he beats Kariya...

693
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,000
tomorrow he'll beat you.

694
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,680
workers are like...

695
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,920
rotten grains he thinks.

696
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,760
If his arrogance has to be broken,

697
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,000
nobody should work for him.

698
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,080
Till he apologises for beating Kariya...

699
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,800
no one among you should go to work in house or fields.

700
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,080
He should understand the value of people who sweat for him.

701
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,560
Come out everybody, no one shall work.

702
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,440
Leave me.

703
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,440
Until there are people like this,

704
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,440
your fate or the village's fate won't change.

705
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,440
Shankara..

706
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,640
Go.

707
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,280
Shankara, shankara.

708
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,520
Shankara.

709
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,680
Are you leaving us brother?

710
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,440
Why should you leave for this?

711
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,760
Is this even a village?

712
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,560
Those who want to live with freedom...

713
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,000
mustn't live in this village.

714
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,400
No one must live...
Shankara

715
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,400
Go inside. Go.

716
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,000
Shankarappa, Shankarappa.

717
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,640
Don't leave because of me.

718
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,120
Even if the village leaves me, Swamiji in the monastery won't.

719
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,840
I'll somehow slave in the monastery and survive.

720
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,720
Don't leave because of me.

721
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,640
Hey Kariya, I'm not leaving because of you.

722
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,000
People like us must not live in this damned village.

723
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,920
Is it so? Go go.

724
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,800
Shankara, you're the one to say that you'll break his arrogance.

725
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,320
Now you're the one leaving fearing him.

726
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,080
Is it right?
Who's leaving fearing him?

727
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,040
I fear if I live with these cowards, I too will become one.That's why I'm leaving.

728
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,480
Go.
Hey Shankaranna, I thought you were strong like Arjuna.

729
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,280
You're running away like Uttarakumara.

730
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,160
Go go
those of us who are stuck in that vulture's mouth

731
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,920
You're going even after seeing them?

732
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,320
Go Go.

733
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,320
The whole village is stuck.

734
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,320
What can I do? What?

735
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,320
I can't do anything.

736
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,280
Shankarappa.

737
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,800
Where're you going?

738
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,080
I'm leaving this village.

739
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,280
Then... You won't come back?

740
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,120
No.

741
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,680
I won't come back even if I die.

742
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,600
This Sundari was born here and will die here.

743
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,320
Shankarappa.

744
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,440
When I die

745
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,240
won't you come to see me off?

746
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,840
Sundarakka.

747
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,840
Go go.

748
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,440
Go burn your house because it's filled with waste.

749
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,320
Cut off your limbs because they're muddy.

750
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,040
Because village has become dirty, you leave it.

751
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:48,960
Go.

752
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,600
Hey Go.

753
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:03,440
This mother earth who gave me birth.

754
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,720
How can I leave her?

755
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,080
This soil which gave me rice.

756
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,560
How can I forget it?

757
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,880
This mother earth who gave me birth.

758
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,800
How can I leave her?

759
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,400
This air, this water are my body,

760
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,800
This street, this house are my cradle.

761
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,840
This air, this water are my body,

762
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,400
This street, this house are my cradle.

763
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:11,440
This Maacha and Kencha, all these names,

764
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,400
Are evergreen in my heart.

765
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,280
This mother earth who gave me birth.

766
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,560
How can I leave her?

767
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,560
I drank the milk of this Gange and Gouri,

768
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:55,000
I enjoyed running around and danced happily in the village.

769
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,880
I drank the milk of this Gange and Gouri,

770
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,360
I enjoyed running around and danced happily in the village.

771
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:17,200
Kaalavva and Subbavva raised me,

772
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,960
How can I forget these mothers who've blessed me?

773
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,880
This mother earth who gave me birth.

774
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,960
How can I leave her?

775
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,120
This life, this body spending all of it,

776
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:55,240
knowing that new desire, new path is a dream.

777
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,280
This life, this body spending all of it

778
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,720
knowing that new desire, new path is a dream.

779
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:17,680
Looking perplexed at the sky and ground below....

780
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:23,600
those caged birds, how can I forget them?

781
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,160
This mother earth who gave me birth.

782
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,600
How can I leave her?

783
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:37,000
This soil which gave me rice.

784
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:50,040
How can I forget it?

785
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,880
Ramanna.

786
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,800
What's all this?

787
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,960
Embracing each other...

788
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,960
hands on each other's shoulders...

789
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,480
Thu [Spits]

790
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,960
Shankara.

791
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,520
Are flour and ash the same?

792
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,080
Shouldn't there be any difference?

793
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,240
There should be.

794
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,240
That difference...

795
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,640
was not there till now.

796
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,640
That's why these villagers...

797
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,880
were fed opium [metaphorically] and you...

798
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,080
and your Sahukara

799
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,680
only you two were awake.

800
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,200
You married because whatever you did became the law

801
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,640
It'll all stop from now.

802
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,960
Kaalappa Uncle.

803
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,200
Go tell your Kauraweshwara

804
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,000
in this Paduvaarahalli,

805
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,960
Pandavas are born and that he be careful about it. Let's go.

806
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,120
We shouldn't have rushed.

807
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,680
We shouldn't have had them turn against us.

808
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,080
See.

809
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,680
4 people became 5.

810
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,320
All five together...

811
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,480
to us...

812
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,600
Don't be silly.

813
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,720
I hold the whole village in this hand like this.

814
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,960
What can those scoundrels do to me?

815
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,240
That's why...

816
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,480
I say that your brain doesn't work sometimes.

817
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,480
Today five.

818
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,480
Tomorrow it's fifty.

819
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,480
Day after it'll be 5 hundred.

820
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,720
So?

821
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,720
So...

822
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,040
Let's cunningly bring them to our side.

823
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,800
What do you propose to do for that?

824
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,840
What do you have to do to bring people on the other side to yours?

825
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,720
Back in ancient times...

826
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,240
in Ekachakra nagara...

827
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,120
all the rice brought home by Pandavas from begging...

828
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,080
Kuntidevi had them sit down and...

829
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,920
she used to feed them.

830
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,640
seeing you I remembered that.

831
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,760
What's this Kaalappa uncle? You come like lightning in the middle of summer?

832
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,520
I came just like that.

833
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,440
When moustache itself starts eating  the nose, what do you do?

834
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,440
Moustache eating nose?

835
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,440
How's this connection?

836
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,360
There is...There is..

837
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,360
Now who are you all?

838
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,280
Your are all closely connected to our Sahukara, aren't you?

839
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,280
Now you?

840
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,600
Our Sahukara's nephew.

841
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,480
Our Kariya?

842
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:42,000
A worker who worked 20 years for Sahukara and was like son to him.

843
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,520
Our Shankara?

844
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,360
Our Mylari,a close friend of Sahukara, his son.

845
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,440
Yesterday night he sat down with me...

846
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:57,280
I explained him in detail how we're all connected.

847
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,560
In Sahukara's eyes,

848
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,680
tears started flowing profusely.

849
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,320
Like this?

850
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,880
Kaalappa uncle?

851
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,720
Hasn't it stopped yet?

852
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,840
No I swear on you.

853
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,240
Kariya.

854
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,240
I don't know what he thought...

855
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,960
Sahukara got up suddenly..

856
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,960
opening the safe like that...

857
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,520
handing me the money like so...

858
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,080
Kaalappa go.

859
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,440
Give Kariya a thousand...

860
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,440
Let him get a gold necklace done.

861
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,680
and he said "let him marry Chenni."

862
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,400
Take it, take it.

863
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,560
Is it so? Ok ok.

864
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,240
For us? for us?

865
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,040
I'll get you what you want. Ask whatever you want. I'll get them.

866
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,400
Kaalappa uncle, come here.

867
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,280
It's worthless.

868
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,240
You took my hat?

869
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,720
Hey that coat is torn, I'll get a new one.

870
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,800
Hey what's all that?

871
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:15,520
Connection Kaalappa is gone, alas. [group singing]

872
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,840
Sahukara, did you see?

873
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,320
These loafers...

874
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,680
made me a dead body while I'm alive.

875
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,200
Screamed and cried all over the village that I'm dead.

876
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,320
Kaalappa.

877
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,520
This is not your insult but mine. My insult.

878
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,440
You sons of bitches.

879
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,720
You've put your hands in snake's burrow.

880
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,360
Be careful.

881
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,680
Sahukara.

882
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,360
You've thrown stone at beehive.

883
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,080
You be careful.

884
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,440
Sahukara.

885
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,600
You made my sister go crazy easily.

886
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,680
You can't make us go crazy like that.

887
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:43,920
Uncle.

888
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,200
You ruined your sister's life without effort.

889
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,240
You can't ruin ours.

890
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,120
Sahukara.

891
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,840
To your money... We're not slaves to your money.

892
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,320
Keep that in mind.

893
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,560
Sahukara, Sahukara.

894
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,120
Money, money, pick them up.

895
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,000
Akka.

896
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,320
Tomorrow is village deity's festival

897
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:43,920
Get up.

898
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,840
Get up. Go take a bath.

899
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,680
We'll take you too.

900
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,520
We'll see if that cures you.

901
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,000
Tomorrow.

902
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,640
Festival.

903
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,360
Tomorrow our mother's [village deity] festival

904
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,160
Sundari.

905
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,160
Tomorrow is village deity's festival. You know right?

906
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,640
I know Sahukara.

907
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,080
Before that.

908
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,520
I thought of visiting my goddess.

909
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,000
No. Go back.

910
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,000
I want to talk with you, come.

911
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,880
Didn't I say no?

912
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:20,840
You won't come?

913
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,560
Leave me Sahukara.

914
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,760
Hey Sundari.

915
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,960
Don't call me Sahukara [master].

916
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,760
I'm your slave.

917
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,560
You're saying the same thing for one year now.

918
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,400
What if something goes wrong?

919
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,720
Let this festival pass.

920
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,280
I'll marry you.

921
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,040
I'll make you my queen.

922
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,440
really?

923
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,360
I swear on village goddess.

924
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,600
Festival came.

925
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,120
Mother goddess will come.

926
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,520
I'll ask her.

927
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,080
Why did Sahukara leave me?

928
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,040
Why did he hit me with a whip?

929
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:34,600
Is it wrong that Sundari loved Sahukara?

930
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,600
Is it wrong?

931
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,880
I'll ask mother goddess.

932
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,920
Festival came.

933
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,600
Mother will come.

934
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,240
Festival is here. Mother will come.

935
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:52,320
Festival is here. Mother will come.

936
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,000
I'll ask her.

937
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:02,640
Festival is here. Mother will come.

938
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,440
Sahukara, Sahukara.

939
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,360
They had come to home asking for you.

940
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,600
Procession has to start.

941
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,960
People are waiting for you.

942
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,640
Then why did you come here?

943
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,720
Let them wait.

944
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,000
Procession can start anytime.

945
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,600
My Nanji has come after a long time.

946
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,560
Hey go.

947
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,000
If somebody asks for him, tell them you don't know. Go.

948
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,200
Nanji, people will wait...

949
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,120
but will you wait?

950
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,400
What's this Kaalappa?

951
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,680
This procession should've started this morning.

952
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,880
It's noon and it's still not started.

953
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,080
What's the meaning of this?

954
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,600
What do you mean?

955
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,920
Sahukara should come, offer his prayers and then it starts.

956
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,520
All this people are standing quietly

957
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,480
Why're you whining?

958
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,560
Kaalappa uncle,

959
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,360
people aren't quiet because of their devotion.

960
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,880
They're quiet because they don't have the courage to ask you.

961
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,880
How long should the people wait?

962
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,760
How long do the children stay hungry?

963
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,760
Is your Sahukara bigger than god?

964
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,240
He must come on time and start the procession.

965
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,800
Be quiet. Sahukara is not in his home.

966
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,840
He must've gone on some urgent business.

967
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,160
Wait quietly till he comes or leave.

968
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,320
The procession won't start till he comes.

969
01:06:55,400 --> 01:07:01,200
Nanji, this farmhouse I built is useful only today.

970
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,440
Ramanna, Ramanna.

971
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,880
Sahukara

972
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,360
In his farmhouse... don't you know Nanjasaani?

973
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,120
He's flirting with her.

974
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:24,120
Will you all wait in this sun till he comes?

975
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,120
Or start this procession?

976
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,200
Let's start the procession ourselves.

977
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:35,440
Sahukara should come. It can't start before he comes. Stop.

978
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,440
Move aside.

979
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,840
Stop it.

980
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,800
Stop it.

981
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,240
Hey stop.

982
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,720
Take it back to where it was.

983
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,840
The goddess can't move till I say so.

984
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,080
Our mother goddess is not your slave.

985
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,120
She's the one who created me and you.

986
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,240
She's going forward and won't step back.

987
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,640
If you want, you come behind this.

988
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,760
Sahukara, Sahukara.

989
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,840
Kaalappa, Mylarappa.

990
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,120
Are you satisfied with the insult to me?

991
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,920
What are you still looking at?

992
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,800
Bora, Thimma, crush these scoundrels.

993
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,080
Hey Rudra.

994
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,960
Go to Chennapura Police station

995
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,280
bring the police telling I sent for them.

996
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,440
Leave my brother, leave.

997
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:43,040
Let's go home...
Leave me mother.

998
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,040
Ramanna, if you crack his head, will they let you go quietly?

999
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,040
Don't. Let's go.
Leave me mother.

1000
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:05,640
Hey, 50 people fall on us 5? Come on, whoever is left.

1001
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,760
Hey you slaves of that Sahukara, come.

1002
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,080
Come, come.

1003
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,880
How many are you? Come.

1004
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:22,160
Officer, you've known how good I am. Kick and take these goons.

1005
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,520
They're spoiling the village.

1006
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:38,080
Please let him go... Shankara, Shankara.

1007
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,520
I have not stolen the gold necklace.

1008
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,640
I don't know what happened to it. I swear I don't know what happened to it.

1009
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,360
I have not stolen the gold necklace.

1010
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,120
Stop, stop. Slowdown.

1011
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,640
Sahukara, these boys have done it without thinking.

1012
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,960
Don't take them to police and court.

1013
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,280
Let's settle this ourselves.

1014
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,280
settle this?

1015
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,920
amongst ourselves?

1016
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,920
It should be decided in court.

1017
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,600
These rascals must see the jail.

1018
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,640
They brought danger to mother goddess' community.

1019
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,840
They've stolen the goddess' necklace.

1020
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,080
When asked why they did so, they beat everyone up.

1021
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:36,240
If these people are let go, tomorrow the whole village will be spoilt.

1022
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,680
Take them officer.

1023
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,760
Let him go.

1024
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:51,400
Take them, take them. These are the ones spoiling the village.

1025
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,560
They're the thiefs, they're the liars.

1026
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,960
These are the ones who scare the village...

1027
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,960
and the ones who do injustice.

1028
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,960
Don't let these people go, police, don't...

1029
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,760
Drag them away, drag them away.

1030
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:20,800
What would happen to those who turn against me, let this whole village know.

1031
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:36,280
The war goes on even after thousands of years,

1032
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:42,600
the war between good and evil men

1033
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:48,360
The war goes on even after thousands of years,

1034
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:54,920
the war between good and evil men

1035
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:16,360
Hiranyakashipu pestered boy Prahlada, but he died at the end.

1036
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,200
Hiranyakashipu pestered boy Prahlada, but he died at the end.

1037
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:34,200
When Narahari came exploding from within the pillar, Dharma won that day.

1038
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,040
the war goes on.

1039
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:43,560
the war between good and evil men

1040
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:05,240
Ravana having ten heads succumbed to Srirama's arrow.

1041
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:17,000
Ravana having ten heads succumbed to Srirama's arrow.

1042
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,880
Mountain of pride fell that day, Dharma won that day.

1043
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,080
The war goes on.

1044
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:32,360
the war between good and evil men.

1045
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:38,040
The war goes on even after thousands of years,

1046
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:44,360
the war between good and evil men

1047
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,080
the war goes on.

1048
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:54,040
the war between good and evil men

1049
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,800
You played all kinds of games in life.

1050
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,560
But you left one out.

1051
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,720
What game is that?

1052
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:05,120
Betting on horse...
Hey that's not a big deal. We'll play that one too.

1053
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,600
But when you're going take me with you.

1054
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,120
Kaalappa.

1055
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:21,000
Those beggar Pandavas have only been sentenced to three months of jail.

1056
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,800
Couldn't something have been done to send them away for three years?

1057
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,760
Those who judge aren't loyal to duty.

1058
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,960
A Sahukara like you helps a village prosper...

1059
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,960
saves the poor...

1060
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,280
brings the country forward.

1061
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,960
You're the village and village is you.

1062
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:44,160
Even after explaining all this, they [judges] didn't listen

1063
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,480
Let it be.

1064
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,280
When they come back with their broken backs after three months,

1065
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:54,040
they won't wag their tail in front of you for another 30 years.

1066
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,640
You mean I live only for 30 years more?

1067
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,640
Still 30 more...

1068
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,520
We can rule however we want.

1069
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,440
Why would I need all that? There's my son to look after.

1070
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,200
all my business.

1071
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,920
Hey Chenni

1072
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,640
On the path Sahukara walks,

1073
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,680
you stand blocking it?

1074
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,600
Like a repo man?

1075
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,760
Give him the way.

1076
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,040
In our village...

1077
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,840
there's one way for Sahukara,

1078
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,120
and another for poor...

1079
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,120
I know it very well, Shakuni [derogatory] uncle

1080
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,640
Shakuni uncle?

1081
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,960
Hey, where are your senses?

1082
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:42,160
When the necklace was stolen during festival, I thought of sending you too with Kariya..

1083
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:46,480
I've let you go because you're our village girl, do you know?

1084
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,280
My Kariya, what injustice had he done to you?

1085
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,640
You sent him to jail.

1086
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,720
Since he was born...

1087
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,720
he worked in your house.

1088
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,880
he served only you.

1089
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:03,320
My Kariya used to eat so much, so much for one meal.

1090
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,720
In jail, only this much...

1091
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:09,080
they say they serve only this much.

1092
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,680
My Kariya is dying without enough food.

1093
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,320
I beg you, please get Kariya released.

1094
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,840
Do you see Kaalappa?

1095
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,600
How she's crying?

1096
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,800
That is...

1097
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,320
the connection between her and that Kariya.

1098
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,120
It makes her cry like that.

1099
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,880
What if we cut that connection?

1100
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,880
All the current is gone...

1101
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,880
Shakuni Uncle.

1102
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:39,960
There's no one born of this soil who can separate us.

1103
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,680
My Bhima who's in jail will come back.

1104
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,880
My Bhima who would break the thighs of this Duryodhana will come back.

1105
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,080
Your Bhima will come?

1106
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,520
He'll break my thighs?

1107
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,360
Before that comes our Dusshasana.

1108
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,800
Rudra.

1109
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,480
Show her Dusshasana's valour.

1110
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,480
Leave me.

1111
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,240
Leave me, let me go.

1112
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,280
Sahukara.

1113
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,280
Shall we see how the bird is?

1114
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,720
Sahukara.

1115
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,640
Kaalappa.

1116
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,520
Why did this Jangama [Itinerant] come here?

1117
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,520
Jangama...

1118
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,520
What's the connection between you and this place?

1119
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,520
Why did you come here?

1120
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,440
Chennavva.

1121
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,680
Wear that cloth and come out.

1122
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,640
You don't have to fear anything till I'm here, my mother.

1123
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,800
Sahukara.

1124
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,040
Do you see? Charity of cloth. Charity of cloth.

1125
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:39,720
Lord Krishna appearing himself, appearing himself.

1126
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:43,000
I may not be Krishna, Sahukara.

1127
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,280
But you're behaving just like Kauravas.

1128
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,320
Hey jangamayya.

1129
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,040
Don't make connections between our Sahukara and mythology.

1130
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,920
Buddhi.

1131
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,520
Get up, rise my mother.

1132
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,800
Sahukara.

1133
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:05,040
This is where the connection is. Between Saffron and sexual desires.

1134
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:10,000
Even if Jangamayya wears saffron on his body,

1135
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,240
can you make those sexual desires that sit within wear the saffron ?

1136
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,160
Sahukara.

1137
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,280
You made fun of the one who wears the saffron.

1138
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,120
Do you make fun of the hand that holds the sickle too?

1139
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,240
Sundari's honour,

1140
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,240
you snatched it.

1141
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,000
Now?

1142
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:57,280
You snatched Chenni's saree too?

1143
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,800
Even if Sundari is dishonoured, I'll let go.

1144
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,200
Give back Chenni's saree.

1145
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,960
You mad dog.

1146
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,960
Won't you give?

1147
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,040
Sahukara, we don't want any connections with crazy people.

1148
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:42,040
Didn't I give him 500 and got signed for 1000?

1149
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,880
And that corner house Maada...

1150
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,040
We should take his 2 acre field into possession today.
You're right.

1151
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,640
Then if they dare to wag their tail before us, will we let him go?

1152
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,640
Anna.

1153
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,120
Anna

1154
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,120
Anna

1155
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:00,680
Anna

1156
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:05,480
What injustice have I done to you that you sent my son to jail.

1157
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,480
I fall at your feet.

1158
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,360
Get him released, get him released.

1159
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:11,360
Lakshamma.

1160
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,800
Once the court has given the judgement, it can't be undone.

1161
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,200
Let him stay for three months.

1162
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,720
See...

1163
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,440
lesson that you learn in jail,

1164
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,440
you won't when outside.

1165
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,560
Lakshmi.

1166
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:29,640
Tell your son to behave at least after returning from jail.

1167
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:35,320
If he turn against me, or support an opposition,

1168
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:39,160
I'll have his limbs broken and tied to a pole.

1169
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:42,360
I'll throw bread little by little at him all his life.

1170
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:48,360
Anna, just because I couldn't bear the grief and came to you, don't talk as you please.

1171
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:52,480
To have his limbs broken and tied to a pole by you

1172
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,520
and to open his mouth for your bread crumbs,

1173
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,960
I've not given birth to a bangle wearing girl.

1174
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:03,000
I've given birth to a man who wears a moustache like you.

1175
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,600
Remember that.

1176
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,000
Sahukara?
Ah forget it.

1177
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:16,720
Kaalappa, for some reason I keep remembering my son today.

1178
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,920
Appaji[father]

1179
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,320
Appa.

1180
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,320
Appa.

1181
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,080
What's this son? You come suddenly.

1182
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,320
I come suddenly, go suddenly. Is it anything new to you?

1183
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,000
Who's that?

1184
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:55,600
Hi Myna, get off please, come in. [In hindi] Get down from the vehicle

1185
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,600
Welcome home.

1186
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,440
Myna, meet my daddy.

1187
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,480
Namaste.

1188
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,880
Shiva, Shiva..
Come inside.

1189
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,200
Wow.

1190
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,400
How do you like the house?
Fantastic, it's very nice.

1191
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,400
This is 300 years old.
uh huh?

1192
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,080
Appaji come here.

1193
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,520
Come come.

1194
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,600
Come.

1195
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,480
Mr.Mari, your father looks very young.

1196
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,560
What's this son? She's calling me a peon?

1197
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:37,120
Appa, In hindi, Jawan means youthful boy.

1198
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,800
She says you look like a young boy.

1199
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,120
Is it so? Shiva, Shiva.
Say that again, say that again.

1200
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:43,920
This?

1201
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,280
He's my father's close friend.

1202
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,680
And his name is Kaalappa.

1203
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,680
Oh, Namaste.

1204
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,280
What did you say his name was? Kallappa?

1205
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,640
Ayyayyappa [Oh god].
Ayyayyappa?
no, no.

1206
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,120
His name is Kaalappa.

1207
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:59,560
Kaalappa?
yeah, lappa,lappa [mockingly]
My name is Mylarappa.

1208
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:02,320
Mylarappa?
yeah, rappa,rappa [mockingly]

1209
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,520
He's right hand and I'm the left hand to our Sahukara.

1210
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,720
Meaning?
Meaning he's my father's right hand and he's the left hand.

1211
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,360
Oh, I see.

1212
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,360
That's alright son.

1213
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,160
Who's this and why has she come?

1214
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:16,800
Appaji, she's from Delhi.

1215
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,280
Oh, this is Delhi connection.

1216
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,600
Sahukara.

1217
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,160
Our Marigowda has connections in Delhi too.

1218
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,640
Isn't he my son?

1219
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,360
Appa, her name is Myna Choudhary

1220
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,720
Her father is a big man in Delhi.

1221
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,320
Oh like our Sahukara is to this village, you mean?

1222
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,200
That's ok son.

1223
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,360
Why did you bring this Delhi here?

1224
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:45,800
We've come planning something big.

1225
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,720
Plan... Plan.

1226
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,000
What's that plan?

1227
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,760
Mr.Mari, I'm tired, Let's go take some rest.
Sure, sure.

1228
01:27:54,760 --> 01:28:00,560
Appaji, we're very tired after travelling. Let's talk about this plan later.

1229
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:04,360
First make arrangements for her. Let her take some rest.

1230
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:13,240
Appa, In our country, to setup big factories even in small villages,
government is ready to give millions of rupees.

1231
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,560
Sahukarji?
Mynaji?

1232
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:23,040
[In hindi] All of us together will open a factory in your village. A big factory.

1233
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,840
What is Mynaji saying?

1234
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,600
She says let us all open a big factory in this village.

1235
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:34,240
Mr.Mari, you haven't told your father about our factory plans? Tell him.

1236
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,240
She's talking about paddy?

1237
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:40,560
She means show it.
oh, in hindi, batta means to show?
yes.

1238
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,080
Appaji, this is our factory plan.

1239
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:46,160
Look at this. This labours' colony. labours' colony.

1240
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,160
What does it mean?

1241
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,720
It means that's where the labourers stay.

1242
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,560
Why do the labourers need house?

1243
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,480
Appa, those are factory rules.
Is it so?
Yes.

1244
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,600
Look at this.

1245
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,600
This is the plan of the house we stay.

1246
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,600
Ah, this is required. This is most required.

1247
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,440
What do you say Kaalappa?
Don't we?

1248
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,440
Sahukarji.
Mynaji?

1249
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:10,120
Listen, to open a factory in your village my father
would get 2 million from the government.

1250
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,800
Appaji...

1251
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:19,240
Her father is ready to get 2million from the government to build a factory here.

1252
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:20,800
2 million?

1253
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,160
Then do it.

1254
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:31,120
But before that, if we give 2 lakhs to her father,
he'll deposit it with the govt. and get 2 million sanctioned.

1255
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,280
How will I have 2 lakhs?

1256
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,120
Don't give it from your pocket.

1257
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:40,320
If you introduce us to people in all the surrounding villages, that's enough.

1258
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,960
Ah, I know, I know.

1259
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:50,000
If you introduce them to people in all surrounding villages,

1260
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:54,480
they'll get hold of everybody from big fish to small fish.

1261
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,000
You give thousand, they'll take it.

1262
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,320
give 500, they'll take it.

1263
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:05,400
give 100, they'll take it, give 5, they'll take it
 and give 50 paise, they'll take that too.

1264
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,920
They'll keep taking like this and make their 2 lakhs.

1265
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:14,640
Go to Delhi, and bring 2 million.

1266
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,000
Is it not, Marigowda?
Correct,correct.

1267
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,840
Ok, let's do as you say.

1268
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,960
Myna, Myna, daddy has agreed, he'll help us.

1269
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,640
Is it? Thanks many many thanks.

1270
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,000
Is she saying she'll start on Friday?

1271
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,080
Appaji.

1272
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,160
Namaste Ji.

1273
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,600
Son.

1274
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,600
What's this new dress?

1275
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:55,280
This lady was shining like queen sitting on throne yesterday.

1276
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:59,160
But today she looks like she's going to forest like Sita.

1277
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,200
That's why, I say that sometimes you don't have brain.

1278
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:08,720
Their dress and the job they're going on are both strongly connected.

1279
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,480
How are they both connected?

1280
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:18,920
If a swami doesn't wear saffron cloth, would you prostrate before them?

1281
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:24,080
If the police don't wear the khaki, would you fear them?

1282
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:31,680
Likewise, in this age, if you want to do something, become something,

1283
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:37,520
The way you talk, the way you dress are important.

1284
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,520
Is it? I got it now.

1285
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,320
Appaji, shall we go?

1286
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,320
Yes, let's go. Come.

1287
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,680
In collecting these 2 lakhs,

1288
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:25,040
you people helped us very much.

1289
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,040
Thank you very much for that.

1290
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:31,640
I haven't seen good people like you in any other village.

1291
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:36,600
She says she hasn't seen good people like in any other village.

1292
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:44,040
God is not up there. He's here in the form of Sahukarji.

1293
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,560
Appaji, she says god is not up there, he's in your form.

1294
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,800
Now, Mr.Mari and I are going to Delhi and I promise,

1295
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,560
that I'll come back soon and help you realise your dreams.

1296
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,280
All of us together will definitely build a factory here.

1297
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,640
Namaste, namaste.

1298
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:10,120
Son, write me a letter about everything from Delhi.

1299
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,120
Yes father.

1300
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:16,200
I'll also go to Delhi.
Hey get down.

1301
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:49,320
One must sing the song once.

1302
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:57,600
that says everyone is equal.

1303
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:06,240
One must sing the song once.

1304
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,320
When worker is broken,

1305
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:31,640
and life is grief striken

1306
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:39,720
When worker is broken and life is grief striken

1307
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:48,160
where is high or low class?

1308
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:56,400
A song that says everyone is equal.

1309
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:04,520
One must sing the song once.

1310
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,920
Unity is the only mantra,

1311
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:30,440
Liberty is possible only with unity.
Yes

1312
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:35,040
Unity is the only mantra
Yes Maacha

1313
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:39,240
Liberty is possible only with unity.

1314
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:47,080
Let's break the ignorance.

1315
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:55,600
A song that says everyone is equal

1316
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:04,360
One must sing the song once.

1317
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:25,280
14 worlds

1318
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:29,480
7 seas
Kencha

1319
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:37,720
14 worlds and 7 seas

1320
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:46,160
We have strength within to conquer them.

1321
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:54,320
A song that says everyone is equal

1322
01:36:54,320 --> 01:37:09,480
One must sing the song once.

1323
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,760
Oh no.

1324
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,760
Bad luck.

1325
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:53,880
Mari, mari come here.

1326
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,680
See there, a group of people are coming.

1327
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,240
Let's take their help.

1328
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,600
Them?

1329
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:01,880
They're my father's enemies.

1330
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,920
Didn't appa say they were in jail? these are the people.

1331
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,920
They're all jail birds?

1332
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,400
We're only two.

1333
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,880
be careful with the suitcase.

1334
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:25,480
Aren't you Sahukara's son Mari?

1335
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,480
When did you get married?

1336
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,680
No she's my friend from Delhi.

1337
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:32,200
Hey, how's your father?

1338
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,200
He'll be fine. what's there to bother him.

1339
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:36,760
See

1340
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:40,240
The wheel is stuck in the mud, will please help us by pushing the car?

1341
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:49,320
Oh, we've decided not to help Sahukara or his family with anything.

1342
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,120
Come let's go.

1343
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:56,600
Just because his father is a wicked man, we need not be so to him.

1344
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,600
Come come.

1345
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,160
Push it.

1346
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:09,640
Push it. Push it with all your stength.

1347
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,640
Hey what's that?

1348
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:16,400
Wearing a suit and boots and standing there, you're ordering us to push?

1349
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:19,720
Lad, do you think we're slaves?

1350
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:22,440
It's your car, come push it.

1351
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,480
Hey what's this? He's left his box.

1352
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:57,840
Hey stop the car.
Hey Kariya

1353
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,080
Let's give it to his father.

1354
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,840
Chenni.

1355
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:18,080
Mangalavva, Mangalavva.

1356
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:23,840
Mangalakka, they've all come back from jail.

1357
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:28,400
Is it? Amma, amma Shankaranna has come back.

1358
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:32,040
Our Shankara is back.
Hey get inside.

1359
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:34,040
Auntie, auntie.

1360
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,680
They've all come back from jail.

1361
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,240
Ramanna and all came back from jail?

1362
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:59,000
Long live Shankaranna. Say it father.

1363
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:01,680
Amma you say it.

1364
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,680
Long live Shankaranna.

1365
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,720
Hey Shankara.

1366
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,520
Don't you dare step inside.

1367
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:14,880
First go to Sahukara, fall at his feet and
 ask for his forgiveness. Then come back.

1368
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,880
I'll let you inside then.

1369
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,840
Anna
Shankaru.

1370
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:21,720
Ramanna let's not live in this village anymore.

1371
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:25,920
Your uncle is demon Kamsa.

1372
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,840
Didn't he take his sister's childrens' lives?

1373
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:31,680
Let's not live in his sight.

1374
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,760
Let's not live in the sight of a man like that.

1375
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,760
My Bhima who's in jail will come back.

1376
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:41,240
I said my Bhima who'll break the
 thighs of Duryodhana will come.

1377
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,560
Kariya.

1378
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:45,240
You thieving low life.

1379
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,280
Go to Sahukara and ask for his forgiveness.

1380
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,320
Only when Sahukara agrees, you'll marry Chenni.

1381
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,240
Come girl.

1382
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:59,800
To get inside my  home, I must fall at Sahukara's feet.

1383
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:04,040
He'll have me tied to a pole and throw me crumbs till I die.

1384
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,920
Even if we want to work somewhere, we need to fall at his feet.

1385
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:13,640
To marry my Chenni, that Sahukara must give his permission.

1386
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,760
Stop the van.

1387
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,080
What's it Mari?

1388
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,560
I forgot the money box there.
Idiot.

1389
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,280
Appaji.

1390
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,960
Appaji.

1391
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,400
What son? You came back?

1392
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,120
First look out for those 5 thieves.

1393
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,360
Which 5 people?

1394
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,360
The ones you sent to jail.

1395
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,920
Are they back? It's three months already?

1396
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,560
What did they do?

1397
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:01,120
They met us on the way and stole the money.

1398
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,120
Hey Rudra.
Yes boss.

1399
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:07,760
Go find those thieves and bring them here.

1400
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,320
Shankarappa.

1401
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:21,320
Dusshasana is coming.

1402
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:25,800
Isn't he the the bastard who stripped my Chenni?

1403
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,560
I'll see.

1404
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:31,080
Hey, Sahukara has sent for you all. Come.

1405
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:33,080
Go tell him we won't come.

1406
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:45,560
Go tell your Sahukara that Bhima has come
 to break the thighs of Duryodhana.

1407
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:47,760
Tell him to come here if he has guts.

1408
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,120
Did he say that, that black son of a bitch

1409
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:52,800
How dauntless he must be.

1410
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,520
Kaalappa, Mari, let's go.

1411
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,720
Stripping of Dusshasana.

1412
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:36,240
Sahukara?

1413
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:39,200
Did you see the plight of your Dusshasana?

1414
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,720
Appa.

1415
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,920
Don't mingle with these scoundrels.

1416
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,920
Come Appa.
Hey go home.

1417
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,920
What?

1418
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,920
Are you playing games?

1419
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:55,320
No,no. Our play is just beginning.

1420
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,200
Bravo.

1421
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:59,280
Hey, will you give the box or not?

1422
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,400
[In hindi] Rascals, where have you hidden our money? 
Bring it back.

1423
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,800
You do something, no?

1424
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,440
Won't you give our box?

1425
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,800
[saying like in a play] Oh elder one, Dharmanandana.

1426
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:14,040
This heinous man is asking for a box.

1427
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:19,960
Should we give it to him or should we give him a knock on his head?

1428
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:26,000
Partha, this enemy of ours is begging for the box. Should we give him?

1429
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,760
Poor fellow, let's give him.

1430
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:30,880
What say you Nakula and Sahadeva?

1431
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,200
May it be done as our elderly commands.

1432
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:34,520
Bhima.
Anna?

1433
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,400
Go forth and bring back the box.

1434
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:38,360
As you command.

1435
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,480
This is not our box, this is not our box.

1436
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:01,880
Bring the box you stole when pushing the car.

1437
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:03,280
Thieving sons of B***hes.

1438
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:07,560
If you call us thieves again.

1439
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:10,520
I'll pull your guts out and make garland out of it.

1440
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:12,520
Shankara.

1441
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,560
This is everybody's money. Don't steal it. Your generation won't prosper.

1442
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:21,400
We were coming from jail. How would we know there was money in the car?

1443
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:27,040
You say it's everybody's money. Who knows?
This man's son and her could've hogged it all.

1444
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,520
Shiva,shiva.

1445
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:36,040
To make our village like Delhi,
these saintly people wandered in the streets collecting the money.

1446
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:40,560
If you accuse them, worms will fall in your mouth.

1447
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:46,880
Hey... You have just now come back from jail. You'll go back again, you thieves.

1448
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:53,200
Did we go to jail for robbing someone? 
We wanted to help the village and you people sent us to jail.

1449
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:59,280
Kaalappa, these scoundrels won't listen to mere words.
 Go to Chennapura police station.

1450
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,680
Go tell them I sent for them.

1451
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:04,440
Call them, we too want that.

1452
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:05,240
Meaning?

1453
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:08,360
Call them and then see for yourself.

1454
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,800
Sahukara, I've seen since my birth.

1455
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,480
Our villagers hadn't gone to courts or police station.

1456
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:19,280
Because of these, we have seen that too.

1457
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:22,640
Let's not bring police again.

1458
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:27,240
Mylari, they've hogged everybody's money and stand here.

1459
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:29,240
How to recover that?

1460
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:32,720
Until they return the money, in this village,

1461
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:38,440
that no one is to give them food, water or give them any work,

1462
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:40,120
banish them so.

1463
01:48:53,440 --> 01:49:00,320
Banishment.

1464
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,880
Who are you banishing?

1465
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:07,480
To your banishment,

1466
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:14,480
our united condemnation, condemnation...

1467
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:34,240
You're wicked people who cheat an innocent woman.

1468
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:41,920
You're cruel people who skin the poor and desperate.

1469
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:48,280
You're heinous people who suck blood of the slaves.

1470
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:56,800
Banishment is for you.

1471
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:59,840
To your banishment,

1472
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:07,560
our united condemnation, condemnation...

1473
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:28,280
Creating fear in holy men, you stand stomping on them.

1474
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:35,520
You're poisonous snakes that take birth inside the womb of wealth.

1475
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:41,720
You're butchers who rip the guts out and torture.

1476
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:48,800
Banishment is for you.

1477
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:52,320
To your banishment,

1478
01:50:52,320 --> 01:51:03,680
our united condemnation, condemnation...

1479
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:07,800
You ordered this banishment and what happened now?

1480
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,800
They've two lakhs in hand.

1481
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:14,920
They'll cut off their connection with this village
 and enjoy elsewhere with that money.

1482
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:18,120
They'll when they're left on this earth, no?

1483
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,120
I'll purge them.

1484
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:23,400
Yes do that and lose those 2 lakhs too.

1485
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:26,400
Let it go. It's everybody's money. I don't care.

1486
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,960
Is it bigger than my pride?

1487
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:31,200
I won't let those who insulted me live.

1488
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,200
So?

1489
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:38,000
They've living in a hut built in Kencha's field.

1490
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,360
When they're all asleep, I'll have them burnt alive.

1491
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,360
Yes, have them burnt.

1492
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,800
They'll be alerted by the heat,

1493
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:49,320
and anyway it's a small hut, they'll come out of it easily.

1494
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:53,080
Then you'll have it lit under you.

1495
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,720
That's why I say that sometimes you don't have brain.

1496
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:59,640
That's not how it's done.

1497
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:04,680
Now, Vishkantha has a good amount of opium with him.

1498
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:06,400
Bringing it...

1499
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:09,000
Let it be.

1500
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:11,720
I'll do that job.

1501
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,400
Is your shame any different than mine?

1502
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:17,240
When you decide to remove them, they have to be.

1503
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:20,960
I'll finish it leaving no evidence.

1504
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:25,080
Avva, somebody has hit your son.

1505
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:27,080
He's lying in the ditch unconscious.

1506
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,440
Where? Where is he?

1507
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:50,560
Go to hell.

1508
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:53,520
You play mischief with me? I'll crush you.

1509
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:57,800
Where had you been mother?

1510
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,320
Even a blade of grass laughs at us now.

1511
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,440
Why?
Let it go.

1512
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:05,240
Get up everybody, have your meals.

1513
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:07,840
Where is Sundarakka?
Chenni took her.

1514
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,200
Where's Kariya?
He's gone to Basavanahalli.

1515
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,000
Don't know when he'll be back. Get up have your food.

1516
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,280
Get up.

1517
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:30,560
Hey Maacha.

1518
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:33,000
Lies down like a log right after meals.

1519
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:39,920
Ramanna, Shankarappa, Hey Kencha, Avva?

1520
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:45,080
What's this? They're lying unconscious?

1521
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,520
Hey Maacha.

1522
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,480
Sahukara.

1523
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,360
Accusing them with false charges,

1524
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:46,000
you sent them to jail.

1525
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:48,200
After they came back from jail,

1526
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,200
you banished them.

1527
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:53,520
Now, setting fire to their house when they're asleep,

1528
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,520
you massacred them.

1529
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,840
Why? why?

1530
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,880
Because they protested against your oppression...

1531
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:05,200
and tried to end your dictatorship.

1532
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:07,920
That is their offense, isn't it?

1533
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:09,440
Swamiji,

1534
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:11,840
if you become a thorn in my way,

1535
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:15,120
you'll have to be removed from the monastery and thrown out.

1536
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,120
Sahukara?

1537
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:21,280
To tolerate injustice for the sake of holy throne,

1538
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,920
Is not the guru's job.

1539
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:25,760
To face Adharma bravely...

1540
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:28,680
is its determination.

1541
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:34,040
Kaalappa
Huh?
Swamiji has come here with enough courage.

1542
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:41,880
Swamiji, what do you want me to do?

1543
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:46,560
You want to put me in court and get me hanged?

1544
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,280
Go, do that.

1545
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:50,280
Mylari,

1546
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:55,920
Is there a tongue that will speak against me in court?

1547
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,040
I know that Sahukara.

1548
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:11,880
Putting a noose called fear around the villagers' neck, 
you've smothered the voice of truth.

1549
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:19,280
Only Dharma has the power to cut that
 rope of oppression, only Dharma.

1550
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:24,480
In the bright light of that Dharma,
 wicked people like you will perish.

1551
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,360
Will perish.

1552
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:36,880
Kaalappa.

1553
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:38,880
Where is Dharma now?

1554
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:42,000
It's wiggling under our feet.

1555
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,400
Rogues, what you're stomping is just a body,

1556
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,080
not the Dharma.

1557
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:55,240
Those who stomp Dharma, 
aren't born and never will be.

1558
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:13,560
Whose house are you looking for?

1559
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:15,560
Where's your Sahukara's house?

1560
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:18,120
Sahukara's house?

1561
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:22,320
I know where it is. Come I'll show you. Come,come.

1562
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,800
Madam, this is my house.

1563
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:51,960
They won't let me into the house.

1564
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:57,400
If I go in, they'll hit me, 
scold me and throw me out.

1565
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:01,360
I won't come inside that house.

1566
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:05,040
I won't come. You go yourself. I won't come.

1567
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:26,480
Namaskara.

1568
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:29,000
Greetings, sit down.

1569
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:33,200
What's this you're sitting down?

1570
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:36,000
Doesn't matter where we sit in our house. 
You sit down.

1571
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,640
Thanks.

1572
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:41,640
It's village, to pass time we keep playing for fun.

1573
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:43,240
No money, no betting.

1574
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:45,560
Who're you? Why have you come?

1575
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:48,800
I wanted a glass of water.

1576
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:52,560
Who's inside? Bring a tumbler of buttermilk.

1577
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,720
My name is Malati.

1578
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:59,440
Writing stories and novels  is my profession.

1579
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:02,720
Oh you're a storywriter.

1580
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,600
What's the connection between our Paduvaarahalli
 and your storywriting?

1581
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:14,720
The people in these photos are from your village, are they not?

1582
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:26,640
These rascals belong to our village.

1583
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,480
What's the connection between you and these villains?

1584
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:32,680
I'm writing a book on prisoners' life.

1585
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:34,680
So, I've selected these people for that.

1586
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,960
The prisoners in this photo,

1587
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,960
after getting out,

1588
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:45,200
have they reformed or have they turned worse,
 I wanted to know. That's why I came here.

1589
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:52,400
I was told, if I ask you, I'll know where they're, 
what they're doing and how they are.

1590
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,400
That's why I came.

1591
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:56,800
No one in these photos is alive now.

1592
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:58,200
You mean?

1593
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:02,960
Meaning, they were burnt alive in their hut.

1594
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,560
How did it catch fire?

1595
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:06,840
Who knows?

1596
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:12,880
Anyway, their sins caught up with them 
and ignited it and burnt them to death.

1597
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,600
You drink the cold buttermilk.

1598
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:15,920
Give her.

1599
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:20,840
That's enough.

1600
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:27,160
They were no small trouble to this village.

1601
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:29,400
Raping women as they please,

1602
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:31,720
ruining the lives of poor.

1603
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:33,720
Making troubles for good things,

1604
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,720
and encouraging bad things.

1605
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:37,720
Things they did, were they just one or two?

1606
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,360
They died.

1607
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:44,080
But it's a great injustice to me.

1608
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:48,200
How's it an injustice if they die?

1609
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,600
If they were all alive,

1610
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,600
writing a book on them,

1611
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,960
I could've made some 5 thousand.

1612
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,680
Now it's not possible.

1613
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:57,920
What are you talking?

1614
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,200
Our elders...

1615
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,480
wrote stories on pious,

1616
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:04,120
on good men,

1617
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:05,800
on truthful people,

1618
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,440
on gods,

1619
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,800
and writing stories on patriots,

1620
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:11,800
they made a living...

1621
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,000
and taught good things to people.

1622
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:16,600
What you're doing is...

1623
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:25,680
writing stories on villains, wicked, loafers and that kind,

1624
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:30,000
do you intend to spoil this society along with you?

1625
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:32,760
Let's see, if you are that good,

1626
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:36,200
write a story on good, truthful people.

1627
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,200
What Sahukara?
Yes.

1628
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:42,040
Where are they now? These good, truthful people.

1629
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:45,400
Why? Isn't he sitting opposite to you?

1630
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:50,960
To our village, he's like god and eyes.

1631
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:52,960
Write a story on him.

1632
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:59,080
Why would they write stories on good people like us?

1633
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:01,080
Sahukara,

1634
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:07,200
If I write stories on good people, I'll get enough god's grace, but what about money?

1635
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:08,880
I'll leave.

1636
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:11,520
Oh, lady from Bangalore, stop.

1637
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:17,200
If you'd written a story on these people, you'd have got, what 5 thousand?

1638
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:21,160
Take 10 and write a story on our Sahukara.

1639
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:25,120
I can write a story on your Sahukara.

1640
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:28,400
But I'll have to stay here for months.

1641
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:32,880
Stay here. Our Sahukara will make all arrangements.

1642
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:36,480
See, before I sit down for writing,

1643
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:39,160
you must give me 2000 in advance.

1644
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:40,480
Why?

1645
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:42,480
We live on that you see.

1646
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:45,560
People who depend on us should be happy right?

1647
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:49,520
What she says is right. These writers don't have enough.

1648
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,840
That's no big deal, we'll give it.

1649
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:52,840
Then it's fine.

1650
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:56,280
Should we send Malathi to farmhouse or keep her here?

1651
02:02:56,280 --> 02:03:00,280
Let us keep her here Kaalappa. Where had you been Mari?

1652
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:03,320
Malathi, come here.

1653
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:06,080
This is my son.
Mari

1654
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:07,040
Namaskara.

1655
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:12,560
She's a writer, she'd come to write a story on those goons.

1656
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:16,440
He asked me not to write on them and instead write one on him. I've agreed.

1657
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:18,840
Till I finish the story, I'll stay here.

1658
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:21,520
Sahukara, who's she?

1659
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:25,760
She's from Delhi, Mynaji. My son's friend.

1660
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:34,640
She came to make our village like Delhi, now she's not there or here, stuck between two places.

1661
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:37,680
That's a long story, you can ask her about it.

1662
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:39,680
Kaalappa.

1663
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:40,640
Mariji,

1664
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:43,520
What are they saying? I didn't understand.

1665
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:44,800
Who's she?

1666
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,800
She's...
I am a writer.

1667
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:49,840
It's nice meeting you.

1668
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,440
Good, you know Hindi too?

1669
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:54,440
Just a little.

1670
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:55,760
Mr. Mari,

1671
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:58,200
he spoke about something, what is it?

1672
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:00,200
That's something that takes time.

1673
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,200
Malathi,

1674
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:05,160
I like action and thrilling stories.

1675
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:07,080
What kind of stories do you write?

1676
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:10,840
I too like action stories.

1677
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:14,800
Then we both have same taste. Let's go inside.

1678
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,880
Malathi.

1679
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:20,800
What's this Kaalappa? You came here?

1680
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:24,160
You're writing a story on our Sahukara, right?

1681
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:27,720
I wanted to secretly talk something about it with you.

1682
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
What is it?

1683
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:34,440
Our Sahukara is an idiot.

1684
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:38,200
I'm the reason for what he is today.

1685
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:42,360
He has a value because of my brain.

1686
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:46,640
That, I understood the first day I met you.

1687
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:54,440
You're writers. You can guage a man's character by just looking at him.

1688
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:58,960
But what is that secret you wanted to talk about?

1689
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:04,040
You're writing a story on our Sahukara, right?

1690
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:11,960
In that, without Connection Kaalappa, there's no Sahukara Sangappa,

1691
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:20,600
readers should think that. 
My name should be highlighted, you must write in such a way.

1692
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:24,200
All that I can write, it's something I can do,

1693
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:30,040
But your Sahukara is giving me 10 thousand.

1694
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:32,040
How much will you give?

1695
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:40,680
Malathi, I don't know why, 
but there's no connection between me and money.

1696
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:50,200
Kaalappa, I don't know why but without money, 
there won't be any connection between my brain and my writing.

1697
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:58,440
I have a very good gold necklace.

1698
02:05:58,440 --> 02:06:01,480
I'll give that, you write.

1699
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:02,600
Ok.

1700
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:04,600
There's another thing in that.

1701
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:13,080
But until you're in this village, you mustn't take that necklace out.
 That is my condition.

1702
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:14,600
Why?

1703
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:19,720
Because that was my wife's necklace.

1704
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:20,760
So?

1705
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:25,600
From children to elderly, everyone has seen it in our village.

1706
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:35,360
If they see that in your neck tomorrow, these useless villagers
 will make a connection between you and me.

1707
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:39,480
You shouldn't get a bad name you see.

1708
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:40,920
Ok

1709
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:42,440
When'll you give me the necklace?

1710
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:44,440
Tomorrow.

1711
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:52,560
Myna, listen to me Myna.
Don't touch me.

1712
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:55,960
My body burns when I see you, you are an idiot.

1713
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:59,280
The scheme I setup after months of planning,

1714
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:02,720
You upset the whole thing in a minute, in a minute.

1715
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:06,720
With that 2 lakh rupees,

1716
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:08,720
I was planning to do a lot of things.

1717
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:11,160
You destroyed all my desires.

1718
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:13,840
You let it slip out of hands when we had it.

1719
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:17,200
Huh, that was money we got by swindling
 people showing them the factory.

1720
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:19,480
Let it go.

1721
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:23,840
Just because it was a small lapse by me,
 I can't tolerate you calling me an idiot or fool.

1722
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:30,520
I too don't want to continue friendship with you.

1723
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:31,240
Myna

1724
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:33,240
I say don't touch me.

1725
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:34,680
Look Mari,

1726
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:37,480
you enjoyed me these many days.

1727
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:40,520
Think that that's all in your fortune.

1728
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:42,520
I won't stay in this village for a minute longer.

1729
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:45,560
Look Mari, van's rent,

1730
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:52,320
my dress, your dress, for all these I've borrowed money. You know that, right?

1731
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:57,720
So, get at least 10 thousand from your father for that.

1732
02:07:57,720 --> 02:08:01,880
After that, we both go our own ways.

1733
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:05,680
If you don't get it,

1734
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:13,000
I'll tell everyone that you were the one who hoodwinked villagers
in the name of factory and have you sent to jail.

1735
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Myna, what shall I do?

1736
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:17,000
My father won't give if I ask.

1737
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:23,880
If you ask, he won't say no. In that you take half and I'll take half.

1738
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:28,720
After that we both go our own separate ways.

1739
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:29,800
Hello.

1740
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:33,160
Thank you.

1741
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:36,360
Oh Malathi, when did you come here and why?

1742
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:40,320
I like taking pictures of sunset.

1743
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:45,760
You two lovers were standing there, 
position was good, so I took a picture.

1744
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:46,960
What's she saying?

1745
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,320
She's saying we're lovers.

1746
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:51,760
Oh Malathi, we're not lovers, we're just friends.

1747
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:55,440
That's what. First friends and later lovers.

1748
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:58,080
And after that, partners.

1749
02:08:58,080 --> 02:08:59,040
Partners?

1750
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:01,040
I mean life partners.

1751
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:06,480
Ok Mynaji, forgive me I disturbed you. Sorry.

1752
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:08,480
Carry on.

1753
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:32,640
Greetings to Kaalappa.

1754
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:37,760
Greetings to you too. I thought I was early. You have come before me?

1755
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:42,920
You said you'll give me gold necklace. Women love gold, don't they?

1756
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:44,040
Have you brought it?

1757
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:46,480
How can I go back on my promise?

1758
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:48,480
Take this.

1759
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:55,280
What's this? This looks old style.

1760
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:59,280
My wife wasn't from your age, right?

1761
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:05,000
You go to your hometown and get a new piece done with this.

1762
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,600
I'll do as you say.

1763
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:09,560
Until then let the necklace be with you.

1764
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:11,560
When going bakc, I'll ask for it.

1765
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:18,240
If you any doubts, take this now. Don't neglect my character in the story thinking I'll cheat.

1766
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:24,160
How's that possible? The story starts with Connection Kaalappa.

1767
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:26,160
I know, I know.

1768
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:28,440
Where are you going? Come along with me.

1769
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:30,440
I'll just wander around.

1770
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:32,440
Then I'll leave.

1771
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Necklace belongs to your deity right?

1772
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,680
There's no doubt. How can he say that it's his wife's, Siddappa?

1773
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:47,720
Mylarappa, accusing Kariya of stealing it, he destroyed my daughter's life.

1774
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:51,680
We shouldn't let him go. We should expose him with the necklace.

1775
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:52,560
Let's go.

1776
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:55,680
Siddappa, be quiet for sometime. Don't rush.

1777
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:59,880
Sahukara, Sahukara.

1778
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:04,400
Those people in the photos, I saw two among them.

1779
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:08,960
They were counting piles of cash.

1780
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:11,680
Myna, we got our money.
really where? how?

1781
02:11:11,680 --> 02:11:13,080
Kaalappa what is this?

1782
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,920
Sahukarappa, you be quiet, I don't believe all this.

1783
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:21,280
I saw them with my own eyes. I went close to talk to them.
 Both the money and they disappeared.

1784
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:22,080
Where?

1785
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:24,680
Near that hill.
Let's go.

1786
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:36,360
Sahukara.

1787
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:39,520
That is the place. Both were sitting there.

1788
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,520
Here?

1789
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:43,240
What's this Kaalappa?

1790
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:48,200
She's a write. She's making a story up and telling us.

1791
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:49,880
Why should I make up a story?

1792
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:53,320
I just went close to talk to them.

1793
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:55,320
They ran away like that.

1794
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:57,200
What's this Kaalappa?

1795
02:11:57,200 --> 02:12:03,280
Sahukara, I swear on your son, I personally had them burnt.

1796
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:05,880
How will they run away?

1797
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:07,800
Sahukara.

1798
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:15,840
That's stolen money and before they could enjoy that, they died. 
So, now they're roaming as ghosts.

1799
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:20,680
So you mean what I saw were ghosts?

1800
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:21,800
Then what else?

1801
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:25,920
What happened? what happened Malathi?

1802
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:27,920
What happened?
what happened?

1803
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:29,600
Hold her, hold her.

1804
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:30,960
Nothing, nothing.

1805
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:37,160
From now on, I won't go roaming in your village.

1806
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:40,480
There are lots of ghosts.

1807
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:44,320
Why don't you write a story on ghosts?

1808
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:47,640
To write a story I should be with them.

1809
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:51,720
What Myna?
That Malathi...

1810
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:54,040
doesn't look like a writer.

1811
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:57,320
She's come here with some plan like us.

1812
02:12:57,320 --> 02:12:59,880
We should be a bit careful.

1813
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:00,920
Understood?

1814
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:07,840
Malathi, you go ahead. Sahukara and I will go to farmhouse and follow you.

1815
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:11,560
But Kaalappa, I'm scared.

1816
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:14,960
We'll be right behind you. Go.
Ok,
Go.

1817
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:25,720
Sahukara.

1818
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:31,120
I'm getting doubts about this writer.

1819
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:35,560
She says she saw ghosts, and they were counting money.

1820
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:39,600
I too have the same doubts.

1821
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:42,920
We should keep an eye on her from now on.

1822
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:51,640
Srirama has come,

1823
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:56,280
to see Sita,

1824
02:13:56,280 --> 02:14:05,720
walking our village path.

1825
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:24,880
Washing the golden feet,

1826
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:29,520
removing the evil eyes,

1827
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:34,400
offering the light from the lamp of gems

1828
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:40,120
Sita saw Rama.

1829
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:46,280
Srirama has come,

1830
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:51,040
to see Sita,

1831
02:14:51,040 --> 02:15:00,000
walking our village path.

1832
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:20,040
Gently spreading her smile,

1833
02:15:20,040 --> 02:15:25,040
giving her smooth hands,

1834
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:29,680
asking for a loving heart,

1835
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:35,480
Sita caressed Rama.

1836
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:41,640
Srirama has come,

1837
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:46,440
to see Sita,

1838
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:55,800
walking our village path.

1839
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:14,680
Mounting the chariot of pearls,

1840
02:16:14,680 --> 02:16:19,320
absorbing the surrounding beauty,

1841
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:24,400
crossing the boundaries of time,

1842
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:30,040
Sita joined Rama.

1843
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:36,120
Srirama has come...

1844
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:40,480
to see Sita...

1845
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:51,120
walking our village path.

1846
02:16:57,320 --> 02:16:58,040
Mangala,

1847
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:03,720
I can't figure out if I'm Rama or Ravana to this Sita.

1848
02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:07,160
It's been two years since I believed you are my Rama.

1849
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:07,920
Is it?

1850
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:10,520
Do you know why I called you here?
Why?

1851
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:17,240
Look, I know where those scoundrels hid the money you've lost.
Really?

1852
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:19,920
I'll bring that to you.

1853
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:24,920
Take that money, build the factory and save your name. I can't see you worrying like this.

1854
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:25,840
Oh, Mangala.

1855
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:29,320
Look, while coming bring Mynaji too with you.

1856
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:33,040
Why Myna? She shouldn't know that we've found this money.

1857
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:36,200
If she doesn't know, how would the factory get built?

1858
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:42,400
Mangala, Myna is not from Delhi, she doesn't have
 her father there and factory won't be built.
Everything is bogus.

1859
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:46,760
Look, we'll take that money and go to Bombay or Calcutta.

1860
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:49,960
Anyway you love me. I too love you.

1861
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:52,400
We'll live like Rama and Sita. What do you say?

1862
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:54,720
Truly?
I swear on my father.

1863
02:17:55,960 --> 02:18:00,720
Tomorrow, I'll be waiting with the box here at this time.

1864
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:04,160
You come, we'll leave without letting anyone know.

1865
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:04,760
What?

1866
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:07,280
Definitely.
Ah, save that for Bombay.

1867
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:09,280
Ok, Bye.

1868
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:17,920
Good Mangala.

1869
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:22,280
You understand now?

1870
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:24,200
You bastards.

1871
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:31,520
Not just that. Do any of you know what was the total amount 
collected in the name of building the factory?

1872
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:33,520
Yes, 2 lakhs.
No.

1873
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:36,400
The amount collected was 3.5 lakhs.

1874
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:40,160
Then the remaining 1.5 lakhs?

1875
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:43,800
It got digested in your Sahukara's stomach.

1876
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:48,920
What did you call those 5 who turned against such people?

1877
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:50,920
What did they all become?

1878
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:56,440
Believing these thieves, we sacrified our children Siddappa.

1879
02:18:57,520 --> 02:19:05,440
These people must be burnt to ashes like how our children died.
Mylarappa.

1880
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:07,680
Wait a little. Don't hasten.

1881
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:05,440
Malathi.

1882
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:10,040
Oh it's you.
Where had you been?

1883
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:12,880
I was just wandering around.

1884
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:16,960
Malathi, didn't you see any ghosts there?

1885
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:19,880
Malathi.

1886
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:25,360
You're writing my story. I need to share some more points with you.

1887
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:28,320
Will you come with me to my farmhouse?

1888
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:34,160
Why farmhouse? We can talk here.
No, it's appropriate to talk in the farmhouse.

1889
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:38,400
Whatever you had to say, you have said. What's left?

1890
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:41,920
I'm writing, i'll finish it soon.

1891
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:50,480
You'll finish. Going straight from our farmhouse 
to your newspaper office in Bangalore, you'll finish us there.

1892
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:52,560
What's this Sahukara? You're talking like this?

1893
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:57,880
We're talking the same thing that you were
 so secretly talking with that Jangamayya.

1894
02:20:57,880 --> 02:21:01,240
Malathi, what's the name of your paper?

1895
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:05,800
I'm not a journalist, Kaalappa. I'm a story writer.

1896
02:21:05,800 --> 02:21:08,160
Rudra, take her to the farmhouse.

1897
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:22,840
Hello Mangala.

1898
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:24,840
Thank you very much.

1899
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:33,720
You rascal. You double cross me? I'll kill you.

1900
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:35,720
Myna, Myna.

1901
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:05,160
Kariya?

1902
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:08,040
Yes, it's the same Kariya who's back.

1903
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:21,760
Maacha, Maacha. Kencha.

1904
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:24,240
We're still alive.

1905
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:30,920
You try run away? Run, run now.

1906
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:52,920
Our deity's necklace is your wife's necklace. Is it?

1907
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:54,920
You murderous bastard.

1908
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:22,640
Guruji, Swamiji...

1909
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:33,120
Swamiji, these people will kill us. Save us, swamiji, save us.

1910
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:43,200
To save or kill you, has to be decided by these villagers
 who tolerated everything like speechless animals.

1911
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:46,560
That's the judgement, that is Dharma.

1912
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:49,560
Malathi,

1913
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:54,480
you believed my words and came to our village and opened their eyes. You must tell,

1914
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:57,400
what punishment has to be given to them.

1915
02:23:57,400 --> 02:24:00,120
Mr.Shankar, I'm a journalist.

1916
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:04,720
To find the truth and show it to the people is our only job.

1917
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:06,720
Not judging.

1918
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:14,960
Amma, cunningly getting all our property, your brother made us stand under a tree.

1919
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:17,440
You must tell what punishment has to be given to them.

1920
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:25,120
To burn us alive, these bastards put opium in our food. 
You must tell what punishment do they deserve.

1921
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:26,520
Chenni.

1922
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:31,920
They stripped you naked, these shameless goons.

1923
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:34,680
