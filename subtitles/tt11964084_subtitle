1
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,800
Hello?

2
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,480
Where are you, Irfan?

3
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,280
Khopri Colony, Lane 4, Room No 17, baby.

4
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,560
Where?

5
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,640
Titu has diarrhoea.
I'm taking him to a doctor.

6
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,920
Wait, I'll call you when I am done.

7
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,400
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

8
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,760
Give it here.

9
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,120
Look over there.

10
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,200
Police.

11
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,720
Stop, stop, stop!

12
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,400
Hey stud!

13
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,800
Stop!

14
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,960
I said stop.

15
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,720
Stop!

16
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,080
Pandey, go ahead.

17
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,920
Take that way.

18
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,160
- Hurry up.
- Okay, sir.

19
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,720
Stop.

20
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,520
What happened? Why are you hitting me?

21
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,000
Stop, stop, stop.

22
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,320
- Sir, sir, sir.
- Who do you think you are?

23
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
Stop it. Let me go.

24
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,240
Use the baton on him.

25
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,280
You sell local dogs saying
that they are imported breeds.

26
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,320
You sell them saying
that they are imported breeds.

27
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
But I...

28
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,840
There's nothing left between us.

29
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,520
You don't like my face
and I don't like yours.

30
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,040
That stands true only for you.

31
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,080
Just yesterday,
Moon said that I look like Virat Kohli.

32
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
She must have said Vinod Kambli.

33
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
- Have you seen your face in the mirror?
- Not possible.

34
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,760
I'm not a lefthander, you see.

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,320
Don't you have any sense?

36
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,960
- I have more than you do.
- Oh really?

37
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,840
Then accept the challenge.

38
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,520
You win if you bet my 1.07 minutes,
I challenge.

39
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,160
I don't have time to waste
for your useless nonsense.

40
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,080
I'll leave as soon as I
can find my LIC insurance policy.

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,720
Running away is a part
of your nature, you see.

42
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,160
You ran away from your
responsibilities as well.

43
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Bhanu is a grown up now.
She can handle herself.

44
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,760
And I realise my responsibilities.

45
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,400
That's why I even come to meet her.

46
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,440
I ran away from you
and the crazy mind of yours.

47
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,760
Don't I have a right to live my own life

48
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,200
Keeping quiet won't do you any good.

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,960
Tell me, I can help you.

50
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,160
I know how boys function.

51
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,360
I know in which direction
their blood flows.

52
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
Let it be.

53
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,520
Are you stepping back because of religio

54
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,720
Rukul, I wouldn't have
made him my boyfriend...

55
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,000
...if I'd believe in such things,
would I now?

56
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,720
I know.
Go on.

57
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,200
I thought he must be
an active member of PETA.

58
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,200
He used to take such good care of dogs..

59
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,200
...just like my father is over
cautious with his bank deposits.

60
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,000
I didn't know that he would be such a do

61
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
Forget your father and
stick to telling me your problem.

62
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,600
He's in jail.
Police arrested him.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,440
He used to sell local dogs to customers.

64
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,400
...saying that they are special
breeds from Uganda and Cambodia.

65
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,960
Someone filed a police complaint
and he was arrested for cheating.

66
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,280
Oh shit.

67
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,520
So, did something happen between you two

68
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,840
I give a damn shit about
this stupidity of yours.

69
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,360
Find 10 mistakes in two pictures.

70
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,520
Have you ever found 10 faults in yoursel

71
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,600
There aren't.

72
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,800
There aren't 10.
There is just one.

73
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,600
I got constipation by mistake last time.

74
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,600
But who doesn't have constipation?

75
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,800
Even Mr. Sharma's dog ate
something bad the other day.

76
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,360
He too got constipated.
It can happen to anyone.

77
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,360
Perfect comparison.

78
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,240
And let me tell you,
your brain is constipated.

79
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Don't you know that the brain doesn't
get constipated, it get controlled.

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,760
A poet has beautifully penned:

81
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,200
'Your memories control my mind.'

82
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,960
'My thoughts and dreams
are now your shrine.'

83
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,360
- Excellent.
- Chuck it. I'm leaving.

84
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,640
I'm not done.

85
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,960
'Now whatever I think,
the thoughts don't seem like mine.'

86
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,760
- Let it go.
- There she runs away again.

87
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,360
Is I am an idiot man?

88
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,400
Mom, you're already leaving?

89
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,040
I'm so sorry, I am late.

90
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,440
Bhanu, I can't tolerate this stupid
man and his constipated poems anymore.

91
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,080
I am sorry.

92
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,480
Now I will only come to
this house when he isn't here.

93
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,720
Mom, did dad say something to you?

94
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,440
What will he tell me when he still
hasn't been about to say anything to Moo

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
But mom, isn't she characterless?

96
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,840
You said it.
But...

97
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,040
I'll call you on Saturday.
I'll come meet you then.

98
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,320
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, mom.

99
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,240
Bye.

100
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,720
- Dad.
- Yeah?

101
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,720
- Dad, what did you tell mom?
- Nothing.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,200
I just recited a poem I
had penned during college days.

103
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,480
Dad, she was angry.

104
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,120
It is possible that
she thought that I stole it.

105
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,360
Everyone thinks that all
poems are written by Mr. Gulzar.

106
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,360
She has never trusted my talent, dear.

107
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,360
- Excuse me, dad.
- Okay.

108
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,400
Yes, Rukul?

109
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,640
What were you saying?

110
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,280
Guess what happened!

111
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400
What happened?

112
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,000
You remember Avinash?

113
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,400
The one I used to flirt with in school?

114
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,560
Of course, I remember him.

115
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,960
You said I love you to him
and spat on your face and ran away.

116
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,440
Why do you only remember bad incidents?

117
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,680
Anyway, tell me what happened.

118
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,240
He happened.

119
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
He has asked me to meet him
at the coffee shop in the evening.

120
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,040
Oh, I see.

121
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,920
That's nice.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,840
"That's nice?"

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,280
Why such a sad reply?

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
What's wrong with you?

125
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,160
I really cannot believe this.
How can Irfan do this to me?

126
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,440
Come on, man.

127
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,400
Hooking up and breaking up with thieves
looks good only in Dhoom series movies.

128
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,400
Forget him.

129
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,240
It's not like you were
dating him for two months.

130
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,840
It's not so easy.

131
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,320
I cannot forget these things so easily.

132
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,400
Anyway, you know that I am still a virgi

133
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,360
There are so many girls
who are still a virgin.

134
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,080
Chill, it will happen some day.

135
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,960
It's just virginity and not
Rajnikant's bones that it won't break.

136
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,200
Nobody stays a virgin at this age, Rukul

137
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Bhanu!

138
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,600
Dad's calling me.
I'll talk to you later. Okay?

139
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,120
Listen, meet me in the evening.
I'll have gossip for you.

140
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,160
- I won't spare him today.
- Fine.

141
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,720
- Bhanu!
- Coming, dad.

142
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,560
Yes, dad?

143
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,400
I am going to the market, dear.

144
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,240
Let me know if you need anything.

145
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,360
Dad, I'll go to the market after college
I'll get whatever I need.

146
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,840
Why will you go to the market?
I am anyway going there.

147
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,080
It's personal, dad.

148
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,520
Personal?

149
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,600
Yes, dad.

150
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,000
What do you need to keep from your dad?

151
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,600
- Have you started smoking?
- Dad, I need to get sanitary pads.

152
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,400
- Pads?
- Yes, dad.

153
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,320
Okay, okay.
The ones they show on television.

154
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
"Ultra Wings."

155
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,000
- Those?
- Yes, dad.

156
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,920
But dear, you are so thin.

157
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,000
Why do you need ultra wings?

158
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,240
You'll have a comfortable
life ahead if you start saving now.

159
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,320
You have to get married too, you know.

160
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,840
This is so embarrassing.

161
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,240
Now what connection does
ultra wings have with my marriage?

162
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,200
I'll tell you.

163
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,040
Everyone used to tell your
grandma to buy ultra pressure cooker.

164
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
Buy a big pressure cooker.

165
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,400
You know how much pressure
mother was facing?

166
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,520
But my mother was so smart that
she always used a small pressure cooker.

167
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,280
I wish mom were here.

168
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,000
Your mother already has ultra wings.

169
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,120
She won't come back.
She doesn't understand poetry.

170
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,000
And don't even make me
start talking about saving.

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,920
Bhanu, I'll go to Mr.
Sharma's place in the evening.

172
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,920
I'll have the evening tea over there.

173
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,400
Why don't you join us there?

174
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,320
Bhanu, please... please be focused.

175
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,920
Listen, this is a calculus derivation.

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,920
I'll go with you.

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,200
There is no one in his house today.

178
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,240
I'll go with you tomorrow.

179
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,520
I promise?

180
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,400
- Hello?
- Listen, do you remember Rajiv?

181
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Avinash's friend?

182
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,680
I don't recall.

183
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,000
The one who couldn't control
himself and shitted in his pants.

184
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
What?

185
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,760
The one who has gap in his
front teeth and laughs weirdly?

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
Exactly.

187
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,440
You have great memory
when it comes to boys.

188
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,240
Bhanu, Avinash told me he likes you.

189
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,920
- Really?
- Yeah.

190
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,640
You are changing the topic in between.

191
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,960
I don't mind,
but he could have told me that directly.

192
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,360
Why did he want to meet you to say that?

193
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,680
Duffer, he told me Rajiv likes you.

194
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,720
How dare you!

195
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,240
How could you even think like that?

196
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,000
The monkey faced Rajiv
is sitting right in front of me.

197
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,920
You gave him the address, didn't you?

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,360
He's just human.

199
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,760
Love happened.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,840
Moreover, you are the one had said that
you want a loving and caring boyfriend.

201
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,560
At least give me a try.

202
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,160
Why the hell should I try?

203
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,320
I am not that desperate.

204
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,360
You don't have experience, baby.

205
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,760
Boys like him later end
up becoming Shah Rukh Khan.

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,640
I am not interested at all.

207
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,440
Stop hiccupping and tell me what happene

208
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,400
Baby...

209
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,840
Oh, my God.
What is this?

210
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,280
Why do you have this with you?
Have you lost your mind?

211
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,120
Whose is it?

212
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,720
This is not meant for girls.

213
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
It belongs to Avinash.

214
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,680
It's extra large.

215
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,840
Baby, I had a nice fuck.

216
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,680
But didn't you just meet him?

217
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,400
After such a long time?

218
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,520
So what?

219
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,720
I've lost him once,
I couldn't let him go again.

220
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,960
I don't repeat my mistakes, you see, bab

221
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,280
But don't you think
that it happened too soon?

222
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,280
You wouldn't have been
a virgin if you were this fast.

223
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,200
Shut up.

224
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,600
Chill, it's okay.
You take everything to your heart.

225
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,080
You talk to Rajiv.
I'll call him.

226
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,360
Lord Hanuman, you once wrote Shri
Ram on a stone, and He got Mother Sita.

227
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,320
I have written a poem.

228
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,520
Tell me, will I get Ms. Bhanu?

229
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,000
Say yes.

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,840
Fine, You can take the credit.
Now say yes.

231
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,440
Yes!

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,120
Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

233
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,040
Bhanu, only fortunate ones
get people who love them so much.

234
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,360
No.

235
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,560
I'll lose Avinash if you say no.

236
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,440
Look how these girls are fighting.

237
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,840
- What a cat fight.
- It's very interesting.

238
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,960
Rukul, you're selling me?

239
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,680
You are a big Shah Rukh Khan fan.

240
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,200
Isn't he the one who says
you should sell everything?

241
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,600
Sell everything.

242
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,200
Rajiv?

243
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,520
Bhanu's on the line, talk to her.

244
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,640
Okay.

245
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,880
Talk to him.

246
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,840
Hello?

247
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,640
Hi.

248
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,520
Fine, hi.

249
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,520
Guess what, I've written a poem for you.

250
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,160
Okay.
Like?

251
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,160
Oh, you like it even before you heard it

252
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,840
Sorry?

253
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,120
You don't need to say sorry.

254
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,440
You should praise even
if you don't like it.

255
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,400
What you are saying?

256
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,560
It goes like this:

257
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,760
I'll pluck flowers
especially for you, you know.

258
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,240
I'll pluck flowers
especially for you, you know.

259
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,000
Once I'll hold your hand,
I'll never let it go.

260
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,200
I have changed the spelling
so that it doesn't get vulgar.

261
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,120
To make it suitable for family audience.
Censor is an issue these days.

262
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
He's talking nonsense.

263
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,840
He's a creative person. Talk to him.

264
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,480
You never know what
you might end up liking.

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,240
Careful, all my boys are locked in it.

266
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,760
Ms. Ramma,
have you brought a parrot along?

267
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,640
A parrot?

268
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,160
Ramma, all this is new to him.

269
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,040
- My daughter is here.
- Hi, papa.

270
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,080
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, uncle.

271
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,680
- Hello, auntie.
- Hi.

272
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,400
- My daughter.
- Okay.

273
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,200
- I'll go and meet auntie.
- Yes, please. Have a seat, dear.

274
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,440
Ramma, please say something
about my daughter as well.

275
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Sure, of course.
Please pick up the cards for her.

276
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,760
- Yes.
- Wait. Three cards.

277
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,160
- Three cards?
- Yes.

278
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,680
Second and third.

279
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,360
Something stuck in your throat?
Phlegm or something?

280
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,200
It's a little... disturbing.

281
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,080
That's why I am thinking.

282
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,560
First you tell me then you can think.

283
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,000
Okay.

284
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,080
She'll face problems having a child.

285
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,480
You mean to say some
kind of medical problem?

286
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,360
No, no, no.
Not a medical problem.

287
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,160
Let me explain in detail.

288
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,440
- Okay.
- Okay?

289
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,440
- There's a hero and a heroine.
- Okay.

290
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,680
There are songs as well. Songs, you know

291
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,120
There's a bedroom.

292
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,240
But the bedroom lights don't switch off.

293
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, come on, madam.

294
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,600
Have you ever seen a
song picturised in the dark?

295
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,200
Tell me?
Nothing will be visible in the dark.

296
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,560
- Why don't you understand?
- You are trying to say that...

297
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,320
...I can't have sex, right?

298
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,480
Hey...

299
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,480
Ms. Ramma, please don't mind it.

300
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,360
Kids these days are
have become quite modern.

301
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,400
It's okay.

302
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,200
'There's a hero and a heroine.'

303
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
'There are songs as well.
Songs, you know?'

304
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,240
'There's a bedroom.'

305
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,400
'But the bedroom lights don't switch off

306
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,440
Bhanu!

307
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,880
Bhanu!

308
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,520
Yeah, dad?

309
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,800
I brought ultra wings for you.

310
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,440
Dad...

311
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,160
I don't know why they
gave it a black plastic bag.

312
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,680
It's not a bomb.

313
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,120
It's so that no one can know the date.

314
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,120
I don't think anyone can read
the small expiry date so easily.

315
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
And what's there to hide in that?

316
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
I'm sorry, dad.

317
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,000
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, my baby. It's okay, dear.

318
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,360
Come on, it was just a prediction.

319
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,720
No one felt bad about what you said.

320
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,160
Everyone knows that this
generation is quite modern.

321
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,800
You're my best friend, dad.

322
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,840
Do you plan to get me emotional?

323
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,960
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,160
Forget the sorry.

325
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,640
Go, wear these ultra wings
and fly as much as you want.

326
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,400
I will not mind it.

327
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,920
Answer your phone.

328
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,080
Yes, Rukul?

329
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,480
What do you want?

330
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,880
You want someone to go out
of business just because you are?

331
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,680
What happened?

332
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,240
Look, Avinash is upset
with me because of you.

333
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,840
Think over it.

334
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,680
It's hard to find a loving
and caring boyfriend like Rajiv.

335
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,240
And he is creative as well.

336
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,120
You'll die alone.

337
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,760
Hi.

338
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,920
Hello.

339
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,640
I have decided not
to recite my poem to you.

340
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,920
I'll recite something hit.

341
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,920
Okay.

342
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,800
I anyway don't like poems.

343
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,480
Okay.
Then should I sing a song for you?

344
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,280
Okay.

345
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,800
Give me a minute.

346
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:46,360
"You are the reason
I pee (smile) so much."

347
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,680
Wait, wait.

348
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,320
Please repeat what did you say?

349
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,360
Repeat it?

350
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,680
"You are the reason
I pee (smile) so much."

351
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,520
I am getting an important phone call.
I'll call you back, okay?

352
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,600
Are you seeking revenge from me?

353
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,560
What happened?

354
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,560
I spoke to Rajiv on phone.

355
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,440
And he's singing and saying
you are my urinary infection.

356
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,480
What?

357
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,440
Did you give him my
number to make fun of me?

358
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,320
Rukul, please,
stop playing pranks with me.

359
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,240
Give me a minute, I'll call you back.
Give me a minute.

360
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,480
120 Ma'am.

361
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,320
"Be generous towards your devotees,
Lord Hanuman."

362
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,920
You fuckin' moron,
what did you say to my friend?

363
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,360
I only sang a song to her.

364
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
A song about peeing, dimwit?

365
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,640
No, a hit romantic song.

366
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
Tell me what's wrong in it.

367
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,800
"You are the reason
I pee (smile) so much."

368
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,400
Wait, wait, wait.

369
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,120
Shut up!
Bloody maestro.

370
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,680
Say I am cool.

371
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,360
I am fool.

372
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,240
Say she smiles.

373
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,560
She pees.

374
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,320
Fuckin' idiot.

375
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,480
I've told you what his problem is.

376
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,840
He lisps, that poor thing.

377
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Anyway, it doesn't make
a difference to me anymore.

378
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,840
Avinash and I are not together anymore.

379
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,360
What?

380
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,840
How, Rukul?

381
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,320
Suddenly break up?

382
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,680
These days boys are
stubborn over experimenting.

383
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,440
Am I a horse?

384
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,960
What would you do if someone whips you?

385
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,880
Whip him back?

386
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,960
Exactly.

387
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,320
I too hit him back.

388
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,960
He thinks he is Mr. Grey.

389
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,480
Look Rukul, I can understand your proble

390
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,280
Nothing seems right after break up.

391
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,680
Right, my foot.

392
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,600
These days there isn't much
difference between boyfriends and shoes.

393
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,960
You can change them whenever you want.

394
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,840
Rukul...

395
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,160
Talk to him.

396
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,560
Go ahead if you like him.

397
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,760
I'll get going.

398
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,840
Bye.

399
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,400
'You are a woman who is full of energy.'

400
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,440
'You will succeed in
the field of education.'

401
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,560
'But there will be
lack of love in your life.'

402
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,280
'Meaning, your hero will come for sure,
but he won't take anything.'

403
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,280
'You will be deprived
of the pleasures of sex.'

404
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Hail Lord Ram.
Hail Lord Ram. Hail Lord Ram.

405
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,040
Hail Lord Ram!
Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

406
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,560
Hail Lord Ram!

407
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,080
Ms. Bhanu? Hail... Hi.
Thank you for calling.

408
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,360
Can we meet tomorrow?

409
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,320
Yes.

410
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,680
When? Where?

411
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,840
Suggest an alone place.

412
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,800
Alone?

413
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,800
What does alone means?

414
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,160
A place no one visits.

415
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,480
A place no one visits?

416
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,600
There is a Lord Hanuman's
temple behind my house.

417
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,200
No one comes there.

418
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,920
Idiot, meet me in the library.

419
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,520
Ms. Bhanu?

420
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,600
I don't think your idea
of meeting in the library is safe.

421
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,800
You should have called him here.

422
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,800
What's the problem with meeting here?

423
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,600
This is the safest place.

424
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,240
Rukul, I am meeting
him for the first time.

425
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,600
That too after school.

426
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,560
I too met Avinash for the first time,
after school.

427
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,160
I cannot be that fast.

428
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,200
That's why you are a virgin.

429
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,040
Hi.

430
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,640
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

431
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,680
Hi.

432
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,480
Hi.

433
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,840
Please keep this a secret, okay?

434
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,000
Of course, yeah.

435
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,400
She's junior to us.

436
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,640
She isn't scared but you are.

437
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,280
'Toilet is not safe.'

438
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,080
Rukul, please, let me meet him first.

439
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,400
And I can't do anything big
without falling in love with him.

440
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,960
I told you, no one comes to this section

441
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,640
It's very very safe.

442
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,240
- There are still ten minutes left, righ
- Yes.

443
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,520
I am waiting four lanes away.
I'll signal as soon as I see him.

444
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,520
And listen, boys these days are cowards.

445
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,560
Give him some hints, okay?

446
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,760
- Be a little forward. Got it?
- Okay. I will manage.

447
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Fine. All the best, baby.

448
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,640
What?

449
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,720
He isn't here yet.

450
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,560
Ms. Bhanu!

451
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,920
- Hi.
- Fine, hi.

452
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,560
I'm sorry, I'm a little late.
Because of this flower.

453
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
No, thanks.

454
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,960
I was confused as to what flower to take

455
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,960
Red or yellow? Yellow or red.

456
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,920
Keep your voice down.

457
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,920
Someone might hear us.

458
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,760
What nice fragrance.

459
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,960
Nice watch.

460
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,320
I really like the design.

461
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,600
Thank you.

462
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,040
It's really nice. It's...

463
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,240
Playing gooseberry.

464
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,000
What?

465
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Nothing.

466
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,960
It's just an idiom.

467
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,960
Means?

468
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,680
Meaning when someone interrupts,
he's playing gooseberry.

469
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,760
Oh, I see. That way.

470
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,960
Yes, that way.

471
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,680
How did you like my small stars' tattoo?

472
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,840
See.
I got them made recently.

473
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,720
You know how it goes.

474
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
I'm letting you know
because you are a friend.

475
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,960
One should change with changing times.

476
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,880
You too need to be modern and liberal no

477
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,240
Because this generation only
thinks about the things they like.

478
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,040
Do you think I am not a modern father?

479
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,400
I'd say the boy's fair,
fares okay in studies too...

480
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,600
...and most importantly his father
has a government job in our city.

481
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,840
Sooner rather than later,
he too will get one.

482
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Really?

483
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,560
Bhanu anyway likes the boy.

484
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,120
Okay.

485
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,520
You and your wife should talk to Bhanu.

486
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,080
How many times will you
keep repeating the same thing?

487
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,560
Hang up.
Idiot.

488
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,480
Why? What happened?

489
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,160
Bhanu was caught kissing in the college.

490
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,160
What rubbish.

491
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,920
Where will kids kiss if not in college?
In temples?

492
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,640
How very LS.

493
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,880
That monkey is sitting with dad.

494
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,840
Mom too is going to join them.

495
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,640
What will I tell them?

496
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,360
Simple, dumbo.
He asked you for help.

497
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,400
Then he made up some excuse
and took you to the Hindi section.

498
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,760
Then he used the excuse of
taking a book and tried to kiss.

499
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,920
And teacher slapped him before you could

500
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,760
Simple.

501
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,320
This is the biggest
advantage we girls have.

502
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,800
We can defame anyone, anywhere, anytime.

503
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,640
The more you lie the
nobler you will become.

504
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,800
You have a few things that belong to me.

505
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,240
Either pay the rent
or take the things away.

506
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,600
Amazing.
You are an amazing poet.

507
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,240
Why don't you compete for awards?

508
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,160
- Awards?
- Yes.

509
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,200
- Come on.
- No, it's possible.

510
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,960
Why is the waiter sitting here?

511
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,760
No, he's our son-in-law.

512
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,360
Bhanu's boyfriend.

513
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,960
What?

514
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,360
- Yes.
- Hello.

515
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,640
Thank you so much for
a wonderful suggestion.

516
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,840
I love you.

517
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Sorry, mom. I was talking on the phone.

518
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,760
Bhanu, you never told
us about your boyfriend.

519
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
What would you like to have, Madhu?

520
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,520
- Listen, please, please just go.
- You should know.

521
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,960
- How would I know?
- I had come to say sorry to you.

522
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,680
Yes, I forgive you. Please just go.

523
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,880
Don't embarrass me in front of my parent

524
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,440
How can you just leave, son?
Where are you going?

525
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,920
Have lunch with us.

526
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,960
No papa, he is late for his dance class.

527
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,360
- Oh.
- He has to leave.

528
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,840
He is such a bumpkin.
I doubt he can dance at all.

529
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,080
Rajiv, please go.

530
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,160
- Bye, uncle.
- Bye, son.

531
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,720
- Bye, auntie.
- Bye.

532
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,080
- Good-bye.
- Very good.

533
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,720
He's such a nice boy.

534
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,920
- Bhanu, he is the right choice.
- Like hell right choice.

535
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,760
Bhanu, I won't attend
your wedding if you marry him.

536
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,880
You cannot spoil your life like I had.

537
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,200
Mom, I don't even know him that well.

538
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,520
Then you two were kissing just for fun?

539
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,640
It was a sort of curiosity.

540
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,920
Curiosity?

541
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,760
What kind of a curiosity is this?

542
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,600
Why can't it be?

543
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,440
It's okay, dear.
Keep trying.

544
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,760
How can someone kiss just like that?

545
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,720
You can anyway do nothing.

546
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,280
At least let her live her life.

547
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,040
What can I not do?

548
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,080
I did four Suryanamaskars
in three minutes.

549
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,720
You won't even be able to do one, fatso.

550
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,640
What did you call me?

551
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,840
- Fatso?
- Yeah, fat lady.

552
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,240
Fuck it, mom and dad.

553
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,920
You two are always fighting.

554
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,120
Bhanu, these types of
cusses are not our standard.

555
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,680
You can't say fuck and all.

556
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,320
If you find something to be
strange then you can say "oh fish".

557
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,720
If it's just girls then you can say FU,
MF, SNAFU.

558
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,640
- It's okay then.
- Mom.

559
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,280
Yes.

560
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,400
Are you educating her or
giving her a crash course on cusses.

561
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,960
It is necessary these days.

562
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,160
Teach her something good.
Like Ramcharitmanas.

563
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,280
Only I know how many
nights you have ruined...

564
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,960
...of mine with this attitude of yours.

565
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,880
Bhanu, listen.

566
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,960
It helps you sleep better.

567
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,680
How would you know? Insomniac person.

568
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,400
Oh, shut up.
Don't interrupt.

569
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,880
Bhanu, listen to me.
You have to get a good guy.

570
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,880
At least... he should be like a hero.

571
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,920
Trust me, such dumbos are of no good.

572
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,080
I'll call you on Saturday.
Then we will talk at leisure.

573
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,040
Okay.

574
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,160
When you cannot even add
the right amount of sugar in tea...

575
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,440
...what can one expect
you to do with your life?

576
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,320
- Bye, dear. Bye.
- Love you, mom. Bye.

577
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,920
- Love you.
- Bye-bye.

578
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,960
Dad?
Excuse me, dad.

579
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,400
- I'm taking a call.
- Please, please.

580
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,800
Yes, Rukul? Tell me.

581
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,000
There is an offer for you.

582
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,680
What?

583
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,920
- My library's sensation...
- Yeah?

584
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,160
He has a handsome, notorious friend.

585
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,560
I'll introduce you to him.

586
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,160
What are you doing?

587
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,720
At least let me get out of this shock.

588
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,320
Why?

589
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
You still haven't acted like
a chaste woman before your parents?

590
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,480
I swear, I am in shock.

591
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,360
And only one shock
can get you out of another.

592
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,840
And the one I am talking
about has such an interesting name...

593
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,480
...that you will get a shock
as soon as you'll hear it.

594
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,560
You are giving a build up like you are
not talking about a boy but James Bond.

595
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,320
You cannot guess it.

596
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,520
Forget you, no one can guess it.

597
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Will you say it already?

598
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,360
Ladies and gentleman.

599
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,960
Brace yourselves.

600
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,040
We have the owner of Orbit Cables.

601
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,360
King of hearts.

602
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,160
The famous gambler, Shartiya.

603
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,840
So, who's our target?

604
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,160
The office boy in blue shirt.

605
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
How much?

606
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,240
I'll bet a 100.

607
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,880
My last 100.

608
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,360
- Hail the Goddess.
- Put it in.

609
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,840
I am not scared either.
Here you go.

610
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,520
'He puts more energy than
he has in his body in winning a bet.'

611
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,760
Hey!

612
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,440
- Run!
- Run!

613
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,160
Stop!

614
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,160
Rukul, he is quite heroic.

615
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,040
I don't deal with fake stuff, baby.

616
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,520
I'm the original Flipkart.

617
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,480
Now I'll give our introduction.

618
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,080
He's Jhanda.

619
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,800
Hi.

620
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,800
He's Pungi.

621
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,120
That's Chukiya.

622
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,600
And I am Shartiya.

623
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,000
Want to go on a trip with me?

624
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,120
"My heart's crossed its bounds...

625
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:15,040
"And leaped into yours."

626
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,840
"My heart's crossed its bounds...

627
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:45,360
"And leaped into yours."

628
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,800
"It's being adamant..."

629
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,320
"It wants you to be mine."

630
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,800
"You don't let me live."

631
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,520
"I don't let you live."

632
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,440
"If this is love then it is what it is."

633
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,200
"I won't accept it any other way."

634
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,040
"I keep losing myself."

635
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,920
"I keep becoming you."

636
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,840
"If this is love then it is what it is."

637
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,840
"I won't accept it any other way."

638
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,880
"My heart's crossed its bounds...

639
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,440
"And leaped into yours."

640
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,360
"I don't wish to flow away like a river.

641
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,240
"I seek your shore."

642
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,960
"Come and hold me."

643
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,920
"I want to lose myself."
"I want to be you."

644
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,160
"Take me into your arms."

645
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,680
"I don't wish to flow away like a river.

646
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,000
"Come and hold me."

647
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,360
"I want to lose myself."
"I want to be you."

648
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,160
"Take me into your arms."

649
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,920
"We have an opportunity."

650
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,840
"We are willing."

651
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,920
"We are together."

652
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,920
"You want it."
"I want it."

653
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,640
"Come, let's act crazy."

654
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,240
"You don't let me live."

655
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,960
"I don't let you live."

656
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,920
"If this is love then it is what it is."

657
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,320
"I won't accept it any other way."

658
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,120
A penny for your thoughts?

659
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,120
It's nothing. I was just thinking.

660
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:08,920
What?

661
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,720
That you are so nice.

662
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,200
I mean you help others.

663
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,400
You don't smoke.

664
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,960
You don't chase skirts.

665
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,960
Honestly speaking,
you are the ideal man like Lord Ram.

666
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,920
Don't mention that name.
He's an old enemy.

667
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,960
Got it?

668
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,680
Dumbo, I mean why don't you stop betting

669
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,640
Stupid, if air gets out of the balloon
and a sim gets out a mobile phone...

670
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,040
...gas gets out a cold drink
and Shartiya stops betting...

671
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,960
...then there will be nothing left insid

672
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,280
Why do you want me empty?

673
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,320
Why not enjoy a complete man?

674
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,960
Oh, a smile.

675
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,600
You are moving in the right direction.

676
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,320
Come on, it's time for another bet.

677
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,520
Today I need to catch
a beak of a flying crow.

678
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,240
You know no one can beat me at that.

679
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,760
Want to come along?

680
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,840
No, I need to go home.

681
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,680
My father must be waiting for me.

682
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,920
Your father.

683
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,120
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

684
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,800
Do you know why I like you?

685
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,480
Because your eyes, both the two
at the back and the two in the front...

686
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,880
...are always completely focused on me.

687
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,760
Ms. Glasses.

688
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,320
Life becomes boring
without any spice in it.

689
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,400
What do you think, Vijay?

690
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,920
Mere mention of spices burns my tongue.

691
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,120
- Let me help you with the tie.
- Oh, thank you, Moon.

692
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,840
- Hello, Moon auntie.
- My daughter is back.

693
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,760
Hello, dear.

694
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,960
We were just about to
leave for the farewell party.

695
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,760
Bhanu, talk to Moon,
I'll go get my blazer.

696
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,880
You must have said that I'm playing
gooseberry in your mind, right auntie?

697
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,560
What do you mean?

698
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,480
Nothing.

699
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,160
I just met mom so I recalled a phrase.

700
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
How's your mom?

701
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,400
She's good.
She was exercising.

702
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,320
She has lost a lot of weight too.

703
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,280
She's looking very sexy.

704
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,720
I'll lose weight too,
I just need someone to motivate me.

705
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,240
Who needs motivation?

706
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:33,960
It's nothing, dad.

707
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,400
Auntie is saying that she's
looking very ugly and fat.

708
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,320
She wants motivation to lose weight.

709
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,920
- What?
- Hey, you are fit.

710
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,720
Do you want to be Mrs. Universe?

711
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,720
I don't know about Mrs. Universe.

712
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,480
First, let me become a missus.

713
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,480
- We should leave, Bhanu.
- Yes. Please, please, please.

714
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,800
Bhanu, I'll be late.

715
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,720
- Please keep the doors locked.
- Okay, dad. Be safe.

716
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,360
My baby.

717
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,680
- Don't forget to lock the doors.
- Okay.

718
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,840
- Come on. Thank you.
- Please, please, please.

719
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,520
- Don't forget about the doors, Bhanu.
- Bye, Bhanu.

720
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,000
- Bye, dad.
- Bye.

721
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,320
- Please.
- Thank you.

722
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,440
My pleasure.

723
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,960
He didn't message me even once.

724
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,440
And he thinks he's a romantic hero.

725
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,680
Oh, my God!
What a pleasant surprise.

726
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,520
Yes!
Oh God, yes!

727
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,360
Wait, let me make a phone call.

728
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,960
Answer the phone, Rukul.

729
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,480
Answer the phone!

730
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,080
Oh no!

731
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,400
- What is it?
- Where the hell were you?

732
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,680
I'm in the toilet.
I'm suffering from constipation.

733
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,040
Nothing's coming out.

734
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,640
Listen, Shartiya messaged me.

735
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,400
Dad's gone out for a wedding.

736
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,120
He won't be back before 12.

737
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,880
That means a gold opportunity.

738
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,760
Yes.

739
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,680
Call him over.

740
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,000
But listen, behave femininely.

741
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,840
Don't be overly direct that
makes the boys lose interest.

742
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,600
Tug half the rope and
let the other half loose.

743
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,000
That's one twisted advice.

744
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,520
Just call him home.
I am sure he will handle the rest.

745
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,600
Wait a second.

746
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,840
Rukul, have you done anything with him?

747
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,440
Are you crazy?

748
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,160
Why would I go after your guy?
He is forbidden to me.

749
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,040
There is something know
as sixth sense as well.

750
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,520
Okay listen,
how should I tell him to come over?

751
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,880
Tell him: The door's open, come in while
you can and go bang-bang-bang.

752
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,000
How cheap, Rukul.

753
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,560
If you cannot even do that
then you should just forget about it.

754
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,520
Okay, fine.

755
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,280
Let me try.

756
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,760
But listen, keep dropping
hints at equal intervals. Please.

757
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,800
I'm getting some pressure,
so you handle your own pressure.

758
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,760
Okay, bye.

759
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,320
What is Madhu doing here?

760
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,960
Dancing.

761
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,000
She starts dancing
as soon as she hears music.

762
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,560
Yet she doesn't lose any weight.

763
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,720
Would you like to dance with me?

764
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,280
You can make me dance to
your tunes any time you want.

765
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,760
Let's go.

766
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,920
Who the artistic one in your family?

767
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,280
An artist.

768
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,400
Whatever.

769
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,880
The Bollywood fan.

770
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,760
My dad.

771
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,000
Oh.

772
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,120
Actually, I too am quite creative.

773
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,120
Really?

774
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,400
Would you like to see my sketches?

775
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,520
Of course.

776
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,920
What's the hurry?

777
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,840
"Don't ask me what happened."

778
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,600
"Don't ask me how I felt."

779
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,480
"Don't ask me what happened."

780
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,680
"Don't ask me how I felt."

781
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,320
"I have already fallen for you."

782
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,480
"I don't know what's in
stored for me in the future."

783
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,080
"Don't ask me what happened."

784
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,080
"Don't ask me how I felt."
- Why are you showing me this hut?

785
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,000
"I have already fallen for you."

786
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,760
"I don't know what's in
stored for me in the future."

787
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,400
"Don't ask me what happened."

788
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,120
"I found the world of love."

789
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,440
"I started believing that you are mine."

790
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,960
"Yet, this question
and this thought lingers..."

791
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,320
Here's your gift.

792
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,680
Thank you.
Thanks for the bottle.

793
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,120
Would you like to see my bedroom?

794
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,480
- Yes.
- Let me show you my bedroom.

795
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,960
"Whatever I have..."
"Me and my love..."

796
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,520
"I'll surrender it all to you."

797
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,360
What does "those who can't
dance blame the floor" mean?

798
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,400
It's getting darker.

799
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,000
The moon is about to get eclipsed.

800
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,600
"How do I say what happened, my love."

801
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,920
"How did I feel?"

802
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,520
"I have already fallen for you."

803
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,560
"I don't know what's in
stored for me in the future."

804
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,160
"Don't ask me what happened."

805
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,880
This is when I got the first
prize in school painting competition.

806
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,160
My daddy.

807
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,760
And this is when I ranked
first in the district in mathematics.

808
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,080
This is when I stood first in debate.

809
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,640
You have always topped.
Have you never failed?

810
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,640
What?

811
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,920
I am not enjoying myself in here.

812
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,120
Let's go outside.

813
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,680
Why? What happened?

814
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,960
- You didn't like my room?
- No, it's nice.

815
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,720
But I would like to sit outside.

816
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,160
Done?

817
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:44,640
What?

818
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,800
With the prayers, bitch.

819
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,200
Sex, what else!

820
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,880
I am so confused.

821
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,800
I don't understand.

822
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,440
I took him to my bedroom.

823
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,600
But he ran away and
went to sit in the hall.

824
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,920
Get close to him, hold his hand.

825
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,200
And if it still doesn't
work then attack him.

826
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,920
He cannot escape.

827
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,080
Rukul, do you want me to rape him?

828
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,960
Dumbo, have you ever
heard a boy crying rape?

829
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,880
We are the weaker sex,
we enjoy it like the rest.

830
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,320
Vijay!
Oh, my God!

831
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,080
Vijay, please.

832
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,120
My father paid for that car!

833
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,760
Get that witch out of there!

834
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,720
- Get her out!
- She's crazy.

835
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,080
Please run her over.

836
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,400
What are you saying?
I'll get charged with murder.

837
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,400
And for asking dowry too.

838
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,160
- What are you doing, Madhu?
- Just shut up.

839
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,200
Why do you always keep
your collars unfolded?

840
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,880
Because I am a king.

841
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,240
And your queen?

842
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,840
Why are you blinking like that?

843
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,280
It's ominous.

844
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,040
You mean inauspicious?

845
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,760
Yes.

846
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,440
Why don't you ask him
to write a dictionary?

847
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,440
You invited him over
to play crossword, right?

848
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,840
What are you looking at?

849
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,000
Come on, let's celebrate.

850
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,800
He wants you drunk.

851
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,800
That means he didn't
get any of your hints.

852
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,760
What are you looking at?

853
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,120
Come on, let's celebrate.

854
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,760
Huh?

855
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,720
It's now or never!

856
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,200
It's now or never!

857
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,920
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

858
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,800
Hey!

859
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,840
It's now or never!

860
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,280
It's now or never!

861
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,680
That's what I am saying.
It's now or never.

862
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,200
First we celebrate.

863
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,120
But it's not necessary.

864
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,160
It's necessary.

865
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,520
I'll first celebrate.

866
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,080
Okay, as you wish.

867
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,440
Go head.
Drink it.

868
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,720
Bhanu!

869
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,360
Your dad's back?

870
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,520
Yeah?

871
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,080
Go inside. I'll go and check who it is.

872
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,080
Her old man has really bad timing.

873
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,200
You are putting all the weight on me.

874
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,080
Hold him from there.

875
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,800
Let's get him out of here.

876
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,840
Bhanu!

877
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,600
Don't drink anything he offers.

878
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,440
Drag him out.
Let's take him away.

879
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:33,880
What happened?

880
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,240
Who was it?

881
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,120
No one.

882
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,520
Neighbour's kids.

883
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,960
They often do pranks like this.

884
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,000
Oh, I see.

885
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,480
Come on, let's celebrate.

886
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,440
Why don't you drink it first?

887
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,400
As they say in English, ladies first.

888
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,160
Let's change the style then.

889
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,200
This time, you drink it first.

890
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,240
Is this an election?

891
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,600
Do you want to change the candidate now?

892
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,200
Please?
For me?

893
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,520
Look sweetheart, listen to me.

894
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,680
Just have a sip of it.

895
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,280
Have it, please.

896
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,520
Just one sip.

897
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,160
No.

898
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,000
- One sip.
- No. I don't want it.

899
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,600
Drink just one sip of it. I am
sure you can have one sip, my sweetheart

900
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,320
No, I don't want to.

901
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,440
Shartiya!

902
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,120
So now, you will shout at me?

903
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,720
If you don't have a sip from
it now then we will no longer be friends

904
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,160
I don't want to be friends with you.

905
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,600
I'll call the police,
if you don't leave immediately.

906
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,360
You'll call the police?

907
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,320
So you are threatening me with the polic

908
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,840
You cunning witch...

909
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,000
Not even a blind man would date an ugly,
spectacled girl like you.

910
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,920
You should venerate me.

911
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,800
You should thank me for going
out with you for a few dates.

912
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,720
Not trot around the market
with your open tresses.

913
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,040
Head and Shoulder's lice-infected
model wants to go for L'Oreal!

914
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,040
Get lost!

915
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,880
Katrina?

916
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,280
Damn it!

917
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,240
I lost a bet because of her.

918
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,880
She ruined such a good atmosphere,
didn't she, Moon?

919
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,520
Did you also think that
this evening was quite romantic?

920
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,280
Can I say something if you don't mind?

921
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,520
Of course.

922
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,000
Sometimes when you lift your eyes...

923
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,840
I feel you want to say
something that you hide.

924
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,840
And what do I want to say?

925
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,840
I am scared to say it.

926
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,560
Oh really?

927
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,080
I swear.

928
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,560
How sweet.

929
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,800
I'll get going then?

930
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,560
- Good night.
vGood night.

931
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,880
"Chandni!"

932
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,160
"Oh my Chandni!"

933
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,760
"You are my moonlight."

934
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,360
'Ouch!'

935
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,600
Oh, my God!

936
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,760
I am so dead!

937
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,920
Bhanu!

938
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,880
Why did you leave the door open?

939
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,800
"Colourful..."

940
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,040
Bhanu!

941
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,000
"Oh my Chandni!"

942
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,040
Bhanu!

943
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,880
Bhanu!

944
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,520
There you are.
You left the door open.

945
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,240
But it's okay.
It's a nature's call.

946
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,000
It can come anytime.

947
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,920
You kept telling me that I
don't see the brighter side of life.

948
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,040
So today, I looked at the brighter side.

949
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,040
And do you know who did
I find on that brighter side?

950
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,240
Your Moon auntie.

951
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,080
Bhanu, I think I have found true love.

952
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,200
I want get drunk today.

953
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,160
Come, my friend.

954
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,920
Let's celebrate together.

955
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,080
It's okay if you are going to take time.

956
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,480
There is no time limit on this.

957
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,080
Actually, I shouldn't be disturbing you.

958
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,440
"With colourful clouds..."

959
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,440
"With the kohl in your eyes..."

960
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:55,360
"I have written your name on my heart."

961
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,000
"Chandni!"

962
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,920
"Oh my Chandni!"

963
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,720
Oh.

964
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,880
Thank you Bhanu, for this.

965
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,120
Wow.

966
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,680
"Chandni!"

967
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,960
"With the kohl in your eyes..."

968
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,400
"I have written... on my heart..."

969
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,560
Papa!

970
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,160
Papa?

971
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,640
What happened, papa?

972
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,080
Papa?

973
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:57,960
Papa!

974
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,000
Get up, papa!

975
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,080
Can you hear me, papa?

976
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,120
Papa?

977
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,760
Papa, please.

978
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,080
Please!

979
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,400
Papa!

980
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,240
Open your eyes, papa. Come on, papa.

981
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,560
Papa!

982
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,520
Bro, I think your bad times have started

983
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,480
You lost that bet as well as this bet.

984
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,360
The girl didn't drink any of it.

985
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,440
Now Lord Ram will come and send
an arrow straight through your navel.

986
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,720
Hey, don't mention that name.

987
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And what's a navel?

988
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,680
Fatso, explain.

989
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,560
You don't know navel? The bellybutton.

990
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,040
Hey, play your turn.

991
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,680
Scoundrel.

992
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,120
Look at my face cut, man.

993
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,920
Do I look like a Ravan?

994
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,480
Do I?

995
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,000
I have just lost two bets and not my lif
Do you understand?

996
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,440
- Let's wait for the third bet.
- Right.

997
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,960
Then I'll fill your mouth with JK Cement

998
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,840
Right.

999
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,000
Yours too.

1000
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:09,840
Stop laughing.

1001
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,320
You are done for.

1002
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,760
Play your turn.

1003
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,960
Why is she charging this way?

1004
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,280
She's all yours.

1005
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,240
Let's go, boys.

1006
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,240
Stop.

1007
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,360
I want to talk to all of you.

1008
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,200
Yes?

1009
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:29,800
Look at me.

1010
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,200
Why are you looking away?

1011
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,160
I thought you are a human being.

1012
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,800
That you have feelings.

1013
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,120
I know I am easy to get convinced.

1014
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,560
Yes, I got convinced.

1015
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,680
Because I can never get someone
as handsome and heroic as you.

1016
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,480
But you aren't heroic.

1017
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,520
You are a coward.

1018
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,440
What's with these tough IIT questions?

1019
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,400
We didn't murder anyone.

1020
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,080
Yes?

1021
00:59:59,160 --> 00:59:59,760
Yes?

1022
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,680
My father's in the ICU
because he drank your alcohol.

1023
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,200
You'd be charged with two murders
if anything had happened to him.

1024
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:16,240
And yes, try telling someone
about your loathsome deed.

1025
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:22,360
Then I'll bet that no one would
even want to spit on your disgusting fac

1026
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,840
"Who do those red lips belong to?"

1027
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,920
"Who stays in your heart?"

1028
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,240
"Who reins it?"

1029
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,840
"Who do those red lips belong to?"

1030
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,320
It would be better if you keep
him away from such bad quality alcohol.

1031
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,520
It is very dangerous for his heart.

1032
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,680
Is everything alright, doctor?

1033
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,440
Yes, all the other reports are normal.

1034
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,520
He will get discharged by evening.

1035
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,240
Okay, good luck.

1036
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,320
I don't know what she applies on her lip

1037
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,560
She's a "poison damsel".

1038
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,960
What are you blabbering mom?

1039
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,400
Heed my advice, Bhanu.

1040
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,320
These Bengali people do
black magic to control people.

1041
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,080
She has done black magic on your father.

1042
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,160
How can you believe in such things, mom?

1043
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,840
Then what should I believe in?

1044
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,320
That your father had locally brewed alco
because he wanted to be adventurous?

1045
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,480
Do you want me to believe that?

1046
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,600
Mom, why don't you change the topic?

1047
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,240
This is serious, okay?

1048
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,880
Pammi auntie also did this
to get her mother-in-law killed.

1049
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,000
Let me call her up.

1050
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,880
She will tell me what needs to be done.

1051
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,080
Please stop this rubbish.

1052
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,600
You too shout at me!

1053
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,560
Go ahead and shout!

1054
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,120
Nobody's with me.

1055
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,400
Mom, please.

1056
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,960
Look at me.

1057
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,040
Don't I look sexy anymore?

1058
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,200
Don't I look nice anymore?

1059
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,240
This morning when I came to hospital...

1060
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,000
...all the doctors were flirting with me

1061
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,800
But your father keeps flirting with her.

1062
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,200
Mom, it's okay.

1063
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,760
It's not okay.

1064
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,360
- Mom?
- You know how alone I feel?

1065
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,920
It's going to be okay.

1066
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,440
Nothing... how will it be okay?

1067
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,400
"These red lips belong to you."

1068
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,080
It is a very important step, brother.

1069
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,160
No love story is complete without it.

1070
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,240
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

1071
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,920
Why are you making such noises?
Are you gay?

1072
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:23,920
No, no, no.

1073
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,200
Stop, stop, stop. Don't move.

1074
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,520
No, no, no.

1075
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,760
This is what's known as surgical strike.

1076
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,240
You didn't even realise
and the work was done.

1077
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,080
Write it down.

1078
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,040
Go ahead.

1079
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,240
I write in blood,
don't assume it to be water.

1080
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,760
I speak the truth,
don't assume it to be a story.

1081
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,600
Wonderful, wonderful.

1082
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,440
You want me to write that as well?

1083
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,160
It provides some appreciation.

1084
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,480
Dad, if she wants to
try again then you should too.

1085
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,480
Who knows the fire might reignite?

1086
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,480
Bhanu, she will burn me alive.

1087
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,200
Then you'll have to extinguish the fire.

1088
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,920
I'm not that violent.

1089
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:11,920
Violent?

1090
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,080
You should be declared a terrorist.

1091
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,120
You see that, Bhanu?

1092
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,480
Papa, try it just once.

1093
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,880
I cannot stay with her.
Please.

1094
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,280
There is some problem.

1095
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,440
What is the problem?
Tell me.

1096
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,160
I don't find you to be desirable.

1097
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,760
- What?
- Yes.

1098
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,760
Take your face out in the market...

1099
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,520
...then you know will
learn how desirable I am.

1100
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,280
Rubbish.

1101
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,920
When I move out wearing
high heels and a red lipstick...

1102
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,680
...people tease me
with fire brigade sirens.

1103
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,840
And you say that I am...

1104
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,320
Mummy can sleep with me in my room.

1105
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,400
- It's okay?
- No.

1106
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,600
I cannot do it.

1107
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,160
Dear, I had told you.

1108
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,120
What had you told me, dad?

1109
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,160
Forget Bhanu, and talk to me.

1110
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,440
Again the same thing?
You have started the same thing...

1111
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,360
Darling...

1112
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,960
Darling, please help.

1113
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,560
Oh, Moon.

1114
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,440
Excuse me.

1115
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,960
Don't give her a penny.

1116
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,040
Just give her a divorce.

1117
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,800
She is back to stay with us, Moon.

1118
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,280
- What?
- Yes.

1119
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,440
She has come prepared, mom.

1120
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,440
Whose room will she
stay in if you stay in mine?

1121
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,520
Papa's bedroom?

1122
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,080
Wait, I'll just put her back in her plac

1123
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,120
Throw this woman out of this house.

1124
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,360
Black magician!

1125
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,080
But I don't do magic shows.

1126
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,000
But you do magic.

1127
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,080
Papa!

1128
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,800
Don't enter my house ever again!
Stay with your lover.

1129
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,560
Let me see for how
many days he will keep you.

1130
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,640
Buzz off.

1131
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,240
- Vijay!
- I'm leaving the old hag behind.

1132
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,040
Papa, are you alright?

1133
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,160
My ex-boyfriend.

1134
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,440
Darling, I cannot leave now.

1135
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,960
- I have left everything for you.
- You liar, he must have left you.

1136
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,080
Your previous three
boyfriends too have left you.

1137
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:53,920
- Vijay?
- Me?

1138
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,640
- Nobody leaves me.
- Mom, aunt, please stop fighting.

1139
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,000
- What are you saying?
- Mom, will papa be alright?

1140
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,360
I'll handle this, dear.

1141
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,880
- You go.
- Moon, Moon...

1142
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,840
Let him go.
He said he would stay with Moon.

1143
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:03,960
Hello?

1144
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,360
I'm done.

1145
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,200
What's done?

1146
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,240
I'm screwed.

1147
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,160
Screwed how?

1148
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,640
I'm pregnant, stupid!

1149
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,760
Oh shit!

1150
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,160
I'm in deep shit.

1151
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,800
Come quickly,
we need to go to Goa, to meet my sister.

1152
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,080
I cannot come.

1153
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,800
There is a big mess over here.

1154
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,680
My life is all messed
up and you are acting selfish?

1155
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,880
Look, I am not going anywhere without yo

1156
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,040
Do you understand?

1157
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,880
Oh shit!
Stop it!

1158
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,840
You have turned this house into a jungle

1159
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,840
Whoever wants is welcomed to stay here.

1160
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,560
I cannot stay in this house anymore.

1161
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,480
I am going.

1162
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,520
Bhanu?

1163
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:44,840
Bhanu, please.

1164
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,200
- Darling?
- Bhanu.

1165
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,280
- Bhanu, I am okay.
- Darling.

1166
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,920
Lord Hanuman,
I have even donated my blood.

1167
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,880
At least now, let me get my love.

1168
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,400
Wonderful.

1169
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,000
Brother, it seems like
Lord Hanuman heard your prayers.

1170
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,960
Sister-in-law is coming this way.
Sister-in-law!

1171
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:07,880
Sister-in-law, stop!
Come here, brother.

1172
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,880
You scoundrel...!

1173
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,400
No, Ms. Bhanu. Don't kill, don't kill.
He is my friend.

1174
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,120
Rajiv?

1175
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,440
He is your friend?

1176
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,200
Yes, yes.

1177
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,560
He's not a goon. He is a good boy.

1178
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,440
Actually, I wanted to thank you.

1179
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,200
For?

1180
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,600
For?

1181
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,880
Thank you for helping me that night.

1182
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,920
You are very nice, Rajiv.

1183
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,400
You are very cute.

1184
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,640
Show it to her.

1185
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,360
Brother has mixed his sweat
and blood and wrote something for you.

1186
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,320
Show it to her.

1187
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,200
Will you come after
the baby starts kicking?

1188
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,520
Sister-in-law?

1189
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,440
We missed the bus because of you.

1190
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,760
Wait, she is talking to someone.

1191
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,480
Now should I spend money
on taxi or on an abortion?

1192
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,480
- Leave it.
- I'll arrange for a taxi.

1193
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,480
Please don't worry.

1194
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,920
- Please don't get upset.
- Can I take you somewhere?

1195
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,840
- You have a car?
- Yes.

1196
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,520
I don't think she will forgive you.

1197
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,920
Then pull up a trick, hippo.

1198
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,040
Don't say that she won't forgive me.

1199
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,200
There is a trick, bro.

1200
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,040
What?

1201
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,480
We will need to ambush
the girl in college.

1202
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,320
Yes, because she doesn't
use Facebook or Twitter.

1203
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,080
Then how will he follow her?

1204
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,560
What the fuck! Bro!

1205
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:25,840
Bhanu!

1206
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:34,240
It's the same monkey who had
ruined our bet outside Bhanu's house.

1207
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,640
What is Bhanu doing with that bonehead?

1208
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,000
We are discussing something
private so we need your ears covered.

1209
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,360
- Okay?
- Oh girl talk. Put it on.

1210
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,560
This knucklehead doesn't
know anything, does he?

1211
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,040
Of course not.

1212
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,480
Fine.

1213
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,080
Hey Neil, listen.

1214
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,000
Did something happen that day?

1215
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,480
I mean you didn't slip, right?

1216
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,120
No, not possible.

1217
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,440
You know, I always take precautions.

1218
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,640
So, when do we meet up?

1219
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,240
Asshole Number Two.

1220
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,160
Hello?

1221
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,760
Shrey, that day in the toilet,
you used protection, right?

1222
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,760
Of course.

1223
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,360
You know that I buy in bulk.

1224
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,840
There is no chance of missing one.

1225
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,840
So tell me, where have you
been since the last three days?

1226
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,600
Fuck!
Not him either.

1227
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,440
What will we do now?

1228
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:35,480
"The child You shall produce,
O Goddess..."

1229
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,040
"Will grow up to do great things,
O Goddess."

1230
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:43,120
"You are bountiful, O Goddess."

1231
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,120
"Everyone else is pauper, O Goddess."

1232
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,400
Will you shut up? The great poet!

1233
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,600
"Everyone else is pauper, O Goddess."

1234
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,240
"O Goddess..."

1235
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,640
Can you keep quiet for sometime?

1236
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,240
I cannot hear anything.
I cannot sing anything.

1237
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,280
I have become a mummy.

1238
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,760
Just shut up!

1239
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,600
If you utter ma, mummy, mother or mom...

1240
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,440
...then I will bury you right away.

1241
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,440
I meant the Mummy Return kind of a mummy

1242
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,560
Shut up!

1243
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,080
I keep calling Bhanu.
Why isn't she picking up her phone?

1244
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,840
I am getting worried.

1245
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,960
Why are you being a
crocodile for no reason?

1246
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,880
These aren't crocodile tears.

1247
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,800
I'm really sad.

1248
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,520
It's my daughter who has gone missing.

1249
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,520
She would have called
me mom if you hadn't come back.

1250
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,520
Even if she is dead,
she won't call you mom.

1251
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,160
Darling, see what kind of a mother she i

1252
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,920
She wants to kill Bhanu.

1253
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,600
Good that you left her.

1254
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,440
What nonsense are you
talking sitting in my house?

1255
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,920
You didn't bring this house in dowry.

1256
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,840
My father paid for the
construction of this house.

1257
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,960
Please stop fighting, the two of you.

1258
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,920
I'll find a solution.

1259
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,040
How will you find a solution when
you cannot find a way to kick her out.

1260
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,360
"He'll find a solution."

1261
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,280
Oh I see.

1262
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,160
I cannot do anything?

1263
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,320
You are right. You cannot do anything.

1264
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,880
Nothing at all.

1265
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,200
1.06 minutes.

1266
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,200
That too under pressure.

1267
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,720
Oh, my genius.

1268
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:14,880
- It's okay.
- What?

1269
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,120
What's there to think so much, bro?

1270
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,120
I'm thinking that the girl
too could have ended in the hospital...

1271
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,680
...because of my stupid mistake.

1272
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,120
But she did end up there,
to meet her father.

1273
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,000
Hey...

1274
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,840
Idiot, use your brains at least sometime

1275
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,360
Is he out of his mind?

1276
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,440
Let me explain it to him.

1277
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,760
You see, he has started liking her. Okay

1278
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,520
Hey illegitimate children
of character actors...

1279
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,400
...you will know how it feels likes
when your father ends up in the hospital

1280
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,320
I swear, I am waiting for that day.

1281
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,320
My father doesn't even
let me add butter to the bread.

1282
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,280
- He's such a scoundrel.
- He says first earn then eat.

1283
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,280
- That's what he tells me.
- Don't put your family drama into this.

1284
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,160
I am asking you to find
a way to apologise to Bhanu.

1285
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,040
Do you understand?

1286
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,320
The way she slapped you,
I don't think she will forgive him.

1287
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,040
I don't think so too.

1288
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:09,800
Want to bet?

1289
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:10,760
Here.

1290
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:11,720
Yes?

1291
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,560
Here, I'll go first.

1292
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,720
I'll bet 500.

1293
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,560
500 bucks, man?

1294
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,960
Put it in.

1295
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,320
Bro, I found her location.

1296
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,320
Both the girls are in Goa.

1297
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,040
Hi.

1298
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,080
You are here.

1299
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,440
- Hi, sis!
- Bhanu!

1300
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,560
I missed you so much.

1301
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,080
Oh, my God! I am so happy to see you.

1302
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,080
- Come on in guys.
- I am here as well, you know?

1303
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,120
Bhanu, Rajiv.

1304
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,240
Rajiv, Lord Hanuman.

1305
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,400
Ms. Bhanu, Rajiv.

1306
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,040
Rajiv, Lord Hanuman.

1307
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,600
Lord Hanuman agrees.
Ms. Bhanu agrees.

1308
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,560
I too agree.
We all agree.

1309
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,560
So, do you know who the father is?

1310
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,080
If I knew,
I'd first go and break his bones.

1311
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,280
And then I would have come here.

1312
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,240
Now, I'll have to spend
all my savings for this abortion.

1313
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,360
Don't worry.

1314
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,240
I know people at the hospital.

1315
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,960
Everything will be set.

1316
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,840
She ran away?

1317
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,200
Someone made her elope?

1318
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,640
Or was she kidnapped?

1319
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,080
Sir, I am sure he sweet-talked
her into going with him.

1320
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:44,160
But he was saying that the
boy was your girl's boyfriend.

1321
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,240
- He's a...
- Okay, okay.

1322
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,240
I mean he doesn't know anything, sir.

1323
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,880
The boy was on a trial run.

1324
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,520
Excuse me, what do you mean by this?

1325
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,040
I don't know anything?

1326
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,840
Do I look like a fool?

1327
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,280
Inspector,
you tell me, do I look like a fool?

1328
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,760
Now how can I tell?

1329
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,880
It is not necessary that
a person is like he looks.

1330
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:07,680
Wonderful.

1331
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,560
See.
See his judgement.

1332
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,160
Inspector,
they have only gone out on a short trip.

1333
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,440
Now you will trust me.

1334
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,480
One second.

1335
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,520
I will show you something.

1336
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,280
See, 1.05 minutes and 10 mistakes.

1337
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,480
You see?

1338
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:30,560
1.04 minutes and 10 mistakes.

1339
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,560
Oh, my God, you are a genius.

1340
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,440
Thank you.

1341
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,800
Fill up this form.

1342
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,920
The child's father signs
here and you sign here.

1343
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,360
Wait a second, doctor.

1344
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,680
According to the law, the child's
father's signature is not necessary.

1345
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,160
Oh, I see.
Now you will teach me law, madam?

1346
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,360
Both the government and
the law belong to us here.

1347
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,760
And this is not just your child, is he?

1348
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,280
Someone else too has a right over it.

1349
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,800
Let me know when you find the father.

1350
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,160
Goodbye.

1351
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,680
What is she saying?

1352
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,880
- I am so sorry.
- What happened?

1353
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,840
What's going on, Raju?

1354
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,920
Madam, all the doctors have
changed after the government changed.

1355
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,080
Now no matter where you go,
even bribery won't help.

1356
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:26,880
Come on, man.

1357
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,160
This child keeps growing in my womb.

1358
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,640
Now from where will I get the father?

1359
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,000
I am so sorry.

1360
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,000
Just give me some time.
I'll think of something.

1361
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,880
These boys couldn't find anyone
else other than me to play this prank?

1362
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,480
I don't know who did this prank.
Fuck!

1363
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,280
Idea!

1364
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,680
Shall we request Rajiv?

1365
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,440
Have you seen his face?

1366
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,160
He looks like a worn out toilet slippers

1367
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,280
He can't be the father.

1368
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,600
How selfish, Rukul.

1369
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,240
There was a time when you
wanted me make him my boyfriend.

1370
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,400
You didn't think about all this back the

1371
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,760
There's a draught in your life, not mine
You're the virgin, I am not.

1372
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,240
Oh I see.

1373
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,680
But the tables have turned now.

1374
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,240
You are pregnant, I am not.

1375
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,000
Are you both mad?

1376
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,360
Is this the time to fight?

1377
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,120
And Rajiv is a very bad option.

1378
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,000
He knows all your college friends.

1379
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,120
Everyone will know that Rukul is pregnan

1380
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:15,960
Stupid.

1381
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,920
Oh shit, shit.

1382
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,480
Tell me, left or right.

1383
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,200
- Left.
- Don't get too close.

1384
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,680
It's showing.

1385
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,200
Sir, your tracking system,
it does track the phone correctly, right

1386
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,800
No, I am asking because
it is government thing.

1387
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,080
Madam, I am going to go Goa
with all of you for a meagre sum...

1388
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,640
...that too in my own car.

1389
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,840
I would make double if I had stayed here

1390
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,760
Why do you need a father?

1391
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,800
And why do you want to kill the baby?

1392
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,640
It hasn't even seen the world.

1393
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,840
And what will the society say?

1394
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,040
Society?

1395
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,400
Shonali, we have been
friends since 10 years.

1396
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,600
Your parents are no more.

1397
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,840
And since when did the two of
you start worrying about the society?

1398
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,520
Such fear for the society?

1399
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,840
What are you trying to say?

1400
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,280
What I am saying is
that it is not a child.

1401
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,440
Baby, it's a gift.

1402
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,200
It's a tiny living being.

1403
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,600
And you don't need
a father for his parenting.

1404
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,880
You can do this on your own.

1405
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,600
Look at me.
Look at me.

1406
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,120
I am also a single father.

1407
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,880
Yes, I too adopted
a child not so long ago.

1408
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,160
When I can do it,
why can't you be a single mom?

1409
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,080
It's a gift.
It's a divine gift.

1410
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,520
You should cherish it.

1411
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,560
Wow.

1412
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,240
Okay.

1413
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,240
Guys...

1414
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,000

1415
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,120
And we are going to the party!

1416
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,280
But...

1417
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,960
- Ice cream?
- Let's go.

1418
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,360
I'll take you some place
cooler than an ice cream.

1419
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,080
Come on.

1420
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,120
Let's go.

1421
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,440
"Ice cream!"

1422
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,400
Ms. Bhanu?

1423
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,840
Ms. Bhanu?

1424
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,240
- Where to?
- Bhanu.

1425
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,800
Only for couples.

1426
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,720
- Here.
- Buzz off.

1427
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,520
- Get lost.
- I said, leave!

1428
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,920
- Go!
- Hey!

1429
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,960
'You have found your prey, Bhanu.'

1430
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,400
'There is an opportunity
as well as an occasion.'

1431
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,160
'You are here and so is the monkey.'

1432
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,400
'Charge, Bhanu. Charge!'

1433
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,120
Bhanu.

1434
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:34,760
- Look ahead.
- Where?

1435
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,000
Look straight ahead. It's Bhanu.

1436
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,400
Go and apologise to her.

1437
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,360
- Huh?
- Go and apologise to her.

1438
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:42,400
Go!

1439
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,840
Go, bro!

1440
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:12,800
Look over there.

1441
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,400
Inspector, he is over there.

1442
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,400
Stop the car.
Stop the car.

1443
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,480
Enjoying grams, huh, you scoundrel?

1444
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Yes, he is the man.
It is him.

1445
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,600
Where's the girl?
Tell me, where's the girl!

1446
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,560
Even boys like you have
started flirting with girls now?

1447
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:34,440
Hail Three Ram!

1448
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,520
Hail Three Ram?

1449
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,560
- Hail three Ram!
- Hail Lord Ram!

1450
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,040
- Hail three Ram!
- Hail Lord Ram!

1451
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,520
No, it's Hail Lord Ram!

1452
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,880
- Hail three Ram!
- Say, Hail Lord Ram

1453
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,240
- Hail Lord Ram!
- Hail Lord Ram!

1454
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,800
Tell me where the girl is.

1455
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,160
Tell me.

1456
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,280
Bhanu!

1457
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,240
- Bhanu!
- Bhanu!

1458
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,560
Bhanu...

1459
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,560
Bhanu!
Oh, my baby. Where are you?

1460
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,000
Like I had said, I'll get the girl back.

1461
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,800
- Oh really?
- I got her back.

1462
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,040
My baby...

1463
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,240
- My turn...
- Not to do this again.

1464
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,600
Do whatever you want, my child.

1465
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,040
But not like this.

1466
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,560
Please.

1467
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,440
Do you understand?

1468
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,720
What plans did you have with this girl?

1469
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:18,880
No.

1470
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,240
No.

1471
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,240
Lift your head up, bro.

1472
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,080
It's not like a bee will
bite you if you lift your head up.

1473
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,720
Don't act like a shy bride
who refuses to show her face.

1474
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,400
Doesn't your father say,
live with your head held high?

1475
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,720
Right?

1476
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:43,320
You didn't cry so much when
the teacher had turned your ass red.

1477
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,600
Even a mute isn't this quiet, man.

1478
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,240
Will you say something, bro?

1479
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,000
Say something, bro.

1480
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,760
Say something at least.

1481
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,720
I am in love.

1482
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,160
He's done for.

1483
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,000
He's a goner.

1484
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,320
He's screwed.

1485
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,920
I'll get another one.

1486
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:08,880
Have you seen my face?

1487
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,440
I shine so bright that even
the Kohinoor diamond gets jealous.

1488
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:15,160
Boys don't stand a chance against it.

1489
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:19,160
Tell me, what does a man do anyway?

1490
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,920
Puts the bun the oven,
whispers a few cusses...

1491
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,040
...and comes back home
at night begging for food.

1492
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,720
And when you ask him to perform,
he cannot.

1493
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,480
But it at least completes
the nature's cycle.

1494
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,600
Call it reverse cycle.

1495
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,520
Coal makes diamond, right?

1496
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,040
He gets married to a
girl who is like a diamond...

1497
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,520
...and turns her back
into coal within one year.

1498
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,720
No.

1499
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:44,120
I have decided that I
won't get an abortion done.

1500
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,160
I am keeping this child.

1501
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,520
And why shouldn't I? I am well educated.
I can earn money on my own.

1502
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,320
I can be a single mother.
And it's my bloody decision, damn it!

1503
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,120
You are pregnant?

1504
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,280
Yes, I am. So?

1505
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,080
Do you also want to
know the father's name?

1506
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,880
The father's name is Rukul Preet Singh.

1507
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,920
Bhanu, I'll bring this child so well tha
no one will ask for his father's name.

1508
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,760
Hey kiddo!

1509
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:21,160
Look Bhanu, marriage is the worst option

1510
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,680
Marriage only gives you kids and worries

1511
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,880
I am anyway getting a kid.

1512
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,520
And if you want worries
then keep a diseased dog instead.

1513
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,320
Bhanu, trust me, we will have fun.

1514
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:38,240
We will stay together.
Single, happy, free.

1515
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,840
Don't get married.

1516
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:41,880
Ma'am?

1517
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,680
- Yes? What?
- Your pack has dried.

1518
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:44,560
Okay.

1519
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:48,160
Okay, I am hanging up.
Listen, men are shit, shit is marriage.

1520
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,920
Okay, bye-bye.
See you, bye.

1521
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,960
What will you have?

1522
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,600
In fact, what will you drink?

1523
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,240
- What will you drink?
- Lemon soda?

1524
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,320
Bhanu!

1525
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,400
Paneer Tikka.

1526
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:02,920
What was so important that
you made me miss my kitty party?

1527
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,240
Mom, it's the question of my life.

1528
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,400
Question of your life?

1529
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,240
Do you want to do MBA, dear?

1530
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,920
There isn't just one question
of everyone's life, okay?

1531
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,960
Mom please, I didn't ask
you two to come here for this.

1532
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,680
I asked you two to come to a
restaurant so that you two don't fight.

1533
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,320
Dear, I keep quiet as usual.
You know that.

1534
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,960
- She is the one who explodes...
- You and keep quiet?

1535
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,640
Quiet? Why?
What do you mean?

1536
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,640
You know everyone in school
used to call me Quietie.

1537
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,000
Hey Quietie!

1538
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,920
I used to stay so quiet, madam...

1539
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,080
...that once a teacher had to
use a stick to force my mouth open.

1540
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,400
- Dad, please.
- No, my baby.

1541
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,440
Moon?

1542
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,120
Let's go.

1543
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,400
It's no one, just your ex.

1544
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,840
Like I said,
no one can stay long with your father.

1545
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,040
Look at the live example.

1546
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,640
It's not like Anarkali
stayed with Salim for long.

1547
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:46,920
Oh please, do you think you are Salim?

1548
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Look at yourself.

1549
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:51,400
Excuse me,
I am not interested in being Salim.

1550
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,000
Hail Lord Ram.

1551
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,000
You see that, Bhanu?
This man changes the topic so drasticall

1552
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,120
So what happened?
What happened?

1553
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,280
My words have such a high reach
that they can go anywhere, madam.

1554
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,760
By the way, what is your problem?

1555
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,560
Look at this.

1556
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,120
This man is still stuck on this.

1557
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,120
Not to do this.
It requires mind.

1558
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,320
Do you guys even have some
interest in my life or not?

1559
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,160
My child...

1560
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,920
Do you even know what am I going through

1561
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,760
- What happened?
- What happened?

1562
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,720
You are busy making records.

1563
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,440
And mom, you are busy living your life.

1564
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,040
Have you ever thought about me?

1565
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,720
Papa too was lucky
enough to have a love life.

1566
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,000
Even if only for some time.

1567
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,200
But what about me?

1568
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,760
I want to get married.

1569
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:31,600
What?

1570
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,520
Marriage?

1571
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,640
It's my final decision.

1572
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:35,920
Hey!

1573
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,800
Hmm.

1574
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,720
You know I too could
have been an astrologer.

1575
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,200
In fact, I was so good in studies
that I raced ahead of everyone.

1576
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:10,960
So, I didn't need
to get into such a field.

1577
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,800
Look, I am here to talk to
you about the boy. Do you understand?

1578
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,560
Priest, I want the boy
to be just like I had described.

1579
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:21,120
Basically, the one without
culture is like a vulture.

1580
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,760
But what about the signs in the horoscop

1581
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,080
What signs?

1582
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:32,160
Her horoscope depicts carnal deprivation

1583
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,440
What?

1584
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:37,800
It means your daughter Bhanupriya...

1585
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,120
...shall forever be deprived
of the pleasures of love.

1586
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:45,400
She will never be able
to have a union with her beloved.

1587
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,560
Are you trying to show
me how good you are in Hindi?

1588
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,920
Just... dear?

1589
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,200
Look, if you want to
get your daughter married...

1590
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,800
...then you'll have to
get her married to a boy...

1591
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,320
...who has similar signs in his horoscop

1592
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,280
Only then, will a happy union is possibl

1593
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,920
Otherwise, forget about it.

1594
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:08,520
According to the planetary position,
the signs are...

1595
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,760
These signs are beyond my comprehension.

1596
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,560
I told you what kind of a boy I require.

1597
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,960
Now if you don't do as
I said then you've had it.

1598
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,720
I'll have Joshi separated
from your Vedant.

1599
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,880
But you should also take
the signs into consideration.

1600
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:22,720
What signs?

1601
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:23,840
- Try to understand.
- Why are you insisting on it?

1602
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:28,240
Priest, he was going to write
your name on the suicide note.

1603
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,280
Priest, we stopped
him with great difficulty.

1604
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,480
Priest, his love is at stake.

1605
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,320
- Please do something.
- Please do something.

1606
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,920
But you don't know anything
about her horoscope.

1607
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,720
Priest, you don't know the
power of Gandhiji's horoscope.

1608
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,200
Here you go, sir.

1609
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,920
Look how breezy it is, sir.

1610
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,400
- It is quite breezy!
- It is, isn't it?

1611
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:49,440
- It is. It is.
- It is.

1612
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,040
Now you won't say anything.

1613
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,440
- Take this.
- Take it, sir.

1614
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,440
Close your fist.
That's it.

1615
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,120
Madam, I suggest you should meet the boy

1616
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,800
You will be in awe.

1617
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,880
He's a gem of a person.

1618
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,040
Priest, I think it would
be better if Bhanu's father and I...

1619
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,520
...meet the boy separately.

1620
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,960
But mom, how can we do this without papa

1621
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,040
Good that you interrupted her, Bhanu.

1622
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:17,080
Bhanu too understands that you cannot
check the boy's intelligence without me.

1623
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,040
Let it be.
You are talking about intelligence?

1624
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:19,920
Oh really?

1625
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,560
I... I am not intelligent?

1626
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:22,920
- Papa, please.
- Just a second, dear.

1627
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,560
- Let me tell her.
- Sorry, papa.

1628
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,800
Sir, you should introduce them to him.

1629
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,640
I don't have any problem
if they give him their consent.

1630
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,120
How can it not be a problem?

1631
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:33,680
First of all, you are getting married...

1632
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,080
...and that too to a
person you don't even know.

1633
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,360
What if his cigarette
has no tobacco in it?

1634
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,920
Then you'll beg me to adopt my child.

1635
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,640
You know how unfortunate I am.

1636
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,200
Now let things happen as they are.

1637
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,960
Anyway, mom likes him.

1638
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,480
Your mom had liked your father too.

1639
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,680
Rukul!

1640
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,040
Sorry.
I am worried about you.

1641
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,920
What's the harm in meeting him once?

1642
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:15,120
I'm sorry that I came
here in such urgency...

1643
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,640
I am surprised that we didn't
even meet once before the wedding.

1644
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,880
I don't know why you are doing this...

1645
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,680
...but I am doing this
because I have realised that...

1646
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:37,320
...no matter whom I love in my life,
it is God who pairs us up.

1647
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,480
I also want to confess that
you aren't the first boy in my life.

1648
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,920
What is she saying?

1649
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,680
I already had a boyfriend.

1650
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,480
And I was deeply in love with him too.

1651
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,720
But my love lost before his bet.

1652
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,280
I cannot promise that I'll forget him.

1653
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:02,160
But I can surely promise that
I will forever be your loyal wife.

1654
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,760
Abhimanyu?

1655
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,440
Why aren't you saying anything?

1656
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,360
What kind of a joke is this?

1657
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,400
I am Abhimanyu.

1658
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,200
Shartiya, don't play with my life.

1659
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,360
I am Abhimanyu.

1660
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:23,920
You...

1661
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,080
Let go of my hand.
Let go of my hand!

1662
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:30,200
Look, now you are the one
asking me to let go of love.

1663
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,520
What were you saying?

1664
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:34,720
That God pairs us up?

1665
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,880
Then our horoscopes too
matched for a reason, right?

1666
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,960
For which bet are you doing all this now

1667
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,160
I am not beating around the bush.

1668
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,600
I am coming straight to the point.

1669
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,080
I love you.

1670
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,400
Your "I love you" comes with no guarante

1671
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,160
Let go of my hand.

1672
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,760
There is no guarantee of life either.

1673
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,440
Hmm?

1674
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,600
But I can guarantee you one thing.

1675
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,160
Of giving you a smile every morning...

1676
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,880
...and taking a smile from you.

1677
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,680
I see God in you.

1678
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:09,760
My beloved, what should I do?

1679
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,560
My head bows down in worship.

1680
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,840
My beloved, what should I do?

1681
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:29,720
I am sorry.

1682
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,680
"It's the wedding night."
"Everyone's delighted."

1683
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:14,920
"Look at the bride's face,
it shines bright."

1684
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:25,080
"Apply some kohl to keep the evil away."

1685
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:31,040
"Apply some kohl to keep the evil away."

1686
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,280
"Looking at my catwalk, hearts slip away

1687
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,080
"I am fearless and naughty."

1688
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,880
"My plait too is flirty."

1689
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:41,840
"When I swirl the party comes to life."

1690
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,640
"When I dance..."

1691
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,400
"When I dance..."

1692
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,320
"When I dance on beat,
I am hard to resist."

1693
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,560
"When I dance..."

1694
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:53,920
"When I dance..."

1695
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:57,680
"When I dance on beat,
I am hard to resist."

1696
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,880
Why are you dancing?
She's marrying someone else.

1697
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,400
Ms. Bhanu's body's marrying someone else

1698
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,200
Her soul belongs to me.

1699
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:22,320
"Play an upbeat song
and feel the sensation."

1700
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:28,960
"Play an upbeat song
and feel the sensation."

1701
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:32,400
"Raise the temperature
and I'll shake the nation."

1702
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,160
"I'm talked about on Instagram."

1703
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:35,880
"Everyone lusts over me."

1704
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,120
"I'll do some fancy moves
and get everyone into the mood."

1705
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,920
"When I dance..."

1706
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,440
"When I dance..."

1707
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,720
"When I dance on beat,
I am hard to resist."

1708
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,440
"When I dance..."

1709
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,920
"When I dance..."

1710
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,680
"When I dance on beat,
I am hard to resist."

1711
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:20,920
"Cuter than cutie."
"I have a million dollar smile."

1712
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:27,080
"Cuter than cutie."
"I have a million dollar smile."

1713
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:30,480
"I am number one beauty."
"I have a Desi style."

1714
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,960
"My look is romantic."
"Everyone thinks it's fantastic."

1715
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:38,240
"Look at the bride dance
wearing gold earrings."

1716
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,840
"When I dance..."

1717
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,440
"When I dance..."

1718
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:45,720
"When I dance on beat,
I am hard to resist."

1719
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,400
"When I dance..."

1720
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,120
"When I dance..."

1721
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:53,880
"When I dance on beat,
I am hard to resist."

1722
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:00,160
Did you look at my necklace?
I got it especially designed.

1723
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:03,000
Mrs. Dimple, where's the groom?
Have you seen him anywhere?

1724
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:03,880
No.

1725
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:04,880
The auspicious hour is passing away.

1726
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:05,920
I don't know where he is.

1727
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:07,720
He must be around, with his friends.

1728
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,680
- I'll go call him.
- No, thank you.

1729
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,080
I'll find him. You wait here.

1730
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,000
Come, sit with us for a while.

1731
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:13,040
- I'll be right back. Wait here.
- Okay, okay.

1732
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,320
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

1733
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:18,520
Do I look good?

1734
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:19,880
Hmm.

1735
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,120
You are soon about to break your fast.

1736
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,360
You are in love.
You are getting married.

1737
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,400
Now just rock his world.

1738
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,560
What should I rock, Rukul?

1739
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,040
Do you still need to ask?

1740
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,360
Did you forget everything
I had taught you?

1741
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:39,760
You are just...

1742
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,040
Bhanu, have you seen Abhimanyu?

1743
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:43,760
No.

1744
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,920
I don't know where
this boy has disappeared.

1745
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,440
The auspicious hour for the
wedding is passing away and he...

1746
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,080
Anyway, it's okay. I'll go find him.

1747
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,640
He is Shartiya.

1748
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,000
He has never lost a bet.

1749
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,000
He's a dog.

1750
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:46,160
First, he schemed and
planned to apologise to Bhanu.

1751
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,440
Bhanu fell for it and forgave him.

1752
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,920
He even convinced her to marry him.

1753
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,200
I am sure he's a devil's spawn.

1754
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:10,400
No matter how scoundrel he is,
but he loves her.

1755
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,040
Yes, he does.

1756
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:39,160
Well... I think he ran away.

1757
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,720
You cannot rock the world
when someone shocks your world.

1758
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,400
It's okay.
Don't cry.

1759
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,440
We'll figure out something.

1760
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,680
Sir, the auspicious hour is passing away

1761
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:57,120
Call the bride so that we
can start the wedding ceremony.

1762
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:00,560
Sir, are you paying attention?

1763
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,360
Sir?

1764
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:03,880
Go and call Bhanu.

1765
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:05,240
Sir?

1766
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,680
Go and call Bhanu.

1767
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:07,640
Be careful.

1768
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:08,680
What happened?
What is it?

1769
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,440
- Go and call Bhanu. Go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1770
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:11,840
Please you do take care of this.
He'll be right back.

1771
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:12,720
Please.

1772
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,520
Hail Lord Ram.

1773
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:19,000
I thought that God does not walk on Eart

1774
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,640
You are a God.

1775
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,000
Shut up.

1776
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,320
From where will you get
a Sherwani (wedding dress)?

1777
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:26,520
Sherwani?

1778
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:29,840
I'll arrange for one, goddess.

1779
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:31,360
Fine, I'll handle the rest.

1780
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,920
Bhanu, dear, why are you sitting here?

1781
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,120
Let's go.
Everyone is waiting for you.

1782
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,000
Let's go, dear.

1783
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:40,640
My baby.

1784
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,280
Again the same thing?

1785
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,720
Doesn't this scene come
after the wedding, dear?

1786
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,640
Why are you doing this now?

1787
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,080
Come on, the auspicious
hour is passing away, dear.

1788
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,480
No, papa.

1789
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,320
Everything will be a mess, dear.

1790
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:55,440
Come, come.
I will not listen.

1791
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,600
There is a set auspicious timing.

1792
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,840
Will I be able to impress everyone?

1793
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:01,960
Of course, you will.

1794
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,520
You have your love and Lord with you.
Nobody can stop you now, brother.

1795
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,640
Expect an explosion now!

1796
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:09,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

1797
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,160
All daughters need
to get married eventually.

1798
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,760
It's not like you are going too far away

1799
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,680
I'll keep visiting you.

1800
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:28,000
- The auspicious hour is passing away.
- He needs to start the ceremony.

1801
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,000
Remove your shoes.

1802
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,960
Take a seat, dear.

1803
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:39,560
- Careful.
- Sit down.

1804
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:43,320
You are finally here.

1805
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,240
I went to take a dump
and people started panicking.

1806
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,400
What happened?
Why are you staring at me?

1807
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:49,760
Don't I look sexy?

1808
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,280
What are you doing?

1809
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:53,560
Huh?

1810
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:54,600
Begin the ceremony, sir.

1811
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:55,840
Why do you look angry?

1812
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,480
You can hit him later.

1813
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,600
Bride and groom,
please stand to exchange garlands.

1814
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,360
Will I ever get married?

1815
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:03,640
Never, if you move around in a turban.

1816
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,200
Come on.

1817
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,280
You're looking hot.

1818
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,360
Take this, son.

1819
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,560
You too take one.

1820
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:13,720
Hold this.

1821
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,840
First, the bride will garland the groom.

1822
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,040
Applause.

1823
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,520
Wonderful.

1824
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,920
It's done. It's done.

1825
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:36,840
Stop with the makeup, you are doomed.

1826
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:39,240
Come on, hurry up.
Hurry up, she's gone.

1827
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,160
Move aside.

1828
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:06,120
Now for the next three vows,
the bride will walk ahead of the groom.

1829
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:07,160
Come on, dear.

1830
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:03,840
I'll go to sleep once their
bedroom's light is switched off.

1831
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:07,280
Sis?

1832
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,400
What? Where? What are you looking at?

1833
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,040
I've noticed that this
fatso has been staring at me.

1834
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:13,200
Really?

1835
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,000
Let me take this to the climax right awa

1836
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,320
She won't give you any.

1837
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:27,360
"Move the veil."

1838
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:30,320
"Show me the beautiful face."

1839
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,680
"I am someone who loves you."

1840
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,560
"I am no stranger."

1841
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:41,640
"I am crazy about you."

1842
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:44,360
"I am no stranger."

1843
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,320
Oh my!

1844
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,240
Knock, knock.

1845
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,360
Who is it?

1846
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,360
Your Iron Man.

1847
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,560
Let me look at your face, ma'am.

1848
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:24,360
Show me your eyes.

1849
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:03,760
What happened?

1850
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,520
Well... just give me a minute.

1851
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:12,240
Excuse me for a minute.
I'll be right back.

1852
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:15,440
I'll be back in jiffy.

1853
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:23,680
Oh no.

1854
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,680
Is the deed done?

1855
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:45,520
He went to the washroom.

1856
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:50,280
Did these knuckleheads
give him too many beers?

1857
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,440
They smile like boneheads too.

1858
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,160
It will happen.
Just chill.

1859
01:46:58,600 --> 01:46:59,600
Okay.

1860
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,000
What are you doing, man?

1861
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:04,280
I just got married.
Don't disappoint me.

1862
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:05,600
What will she think about me?

1863
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,080
Aren't you my darling little brother?

1864
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:14,960
Aren't you my little brother, huh?

1865
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,480
You remember we used to
play together since childhood?

1866
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,640
Abhimanyu?

1867
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:29,000
Yes?

1868
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:30,320
Is everything alright?

1869
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,960
Yes, everything is alright.

1870
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:35,160
Cause havoc!

1871
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:36,920
That's it.

1872
01:47:56,760 --> 01:48:00,200
Mr. Abhimanyu, you bribed
me to make the desired horoscope.

1873
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,920
But I also have your
original horoscope with me.

1874
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:06,480
Don't mind me saying
this but according to this...

1875
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:11,640
...it would be better if you seek a doct
advice before consummating your marriage

1876
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:15,720
There are signs of cavernous dysfunction

1877
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,600
I mean there will be a feast
but you won't be able to enjoy it.

1878
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,720
Cause havoc!
That's it.

1879
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:31,200
Like sparrows fly.
Crows fly.

1880
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:32,480
Elephants fly.

1881
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,240
Today, you too have to fly.
