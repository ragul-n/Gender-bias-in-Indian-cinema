1
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,835
"ANY TIME, ALL THE TIME"

2
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,210
Alarm bell rang as usual!

3
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:57,376
Now, it's 8 '0' clock!

4
00:04:57,668 --> 00:04:59,126
That means, 8 a.m.

5
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:03,335
It'll become 9, then 10 - all as usual!

6
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:08,335
Ugh! Boring routines!

7
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:11,085
All are chasing time!

8
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:12,751
Usual vehicles plying

9
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:14,251
...Usual timings...

10
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:16,126
...Usual ways...

11
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:17,376
People we meet usually

12
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:19,085
...who smile usually

13
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:21,876
who ignores us usually.

14
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:24,585
Nobody skips from regular routine.

15
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:26,751
What Sir! Time is money!

16
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,376
How many times I was asking you?

17
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:29,626
You should deliver it on time!

18
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:30,501
We've a deadline!

19
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,626
Auto..Auto.

20
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:38,168
Go fast!!

21
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,251
No No...it has to be done
at the fixed time!

22
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:42,251
That's why, we've fixed a time.

23
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:45,751
How long I've been waiting here?

24
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,376
You don't have value for time?

25
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:51,376
- Take it!
- Balance?

26
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:52,251
Keep the change

27
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:11,751
Definitely it's Mathan!
Who else?

28
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:14,293
You stupid!

29
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:15,543
Bro, please open!

30
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,501
Don't break the door, you stupid!

31
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:18,876
I'm unable to control!

32
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:29,626
Didn't I tell you?

33
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:30,751
I did whatever you said.

34
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:32,668
I pressed the doorbell!
Knocked lightly, on the door.

35
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:35,126
As it was urgent
I knocked the door a little harder

36
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:35,751
I'm sorry!

37
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:37,751
Why are you rushing into my room?

38
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:39,168
If I don't go immediately,
I'll be in trouble!

39
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:40,251
Use the outside toilet!

40
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,001
I'm not in a position to carry
a bucket of water.

41
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:47,251
If girls notice me rushing
with a bucket from the flat,

42
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:48,376
That will create a bad name for you!

43
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:49,335
Please move.

44
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,251
Why bad name for me?

45
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:56,251
I need to go to the office!

46
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:57,251
I've a review meeting.

47
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,668
If Vineeth N Pillai attends
the Review meeting on time,

48
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,793
Srikumari Amma will get a heart attack!

49
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:02,876
Why needlessly...

50
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:04,376
You buffalo! Come out.

51
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,501
Then, build a toilet in my room also.

52
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:07,751
Your room?

53
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:10,001
Despite staying here free of cost,

54
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,126
Claiming rights also?

55
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:15,126
Last night, there was a photo shoot
for Fire magazine

56
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:17,835
MLA Rajendra Kumar will
surely be cornered!

57
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,876
A set-up in the New Kerala lodge!

58
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:22,001
If you see that lady...

59
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:23,210
You'll never believe!

60
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:27,001
If we bring her to the studio,
and take a snap..

61
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:28,835
It can be used as cover page
for the Women's magazine!

62
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:32,001
If you let such filthy woman
in the studio,

63
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:34,960
you'll be out of the
studio and this house.

64
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:38,876
You've some spelling
mistakes with Women!

65
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:00,001
Who'll know if I don't brush
my teeth or take bath!

66
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:02,251
May the review meeting goes well!

67
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,501
- Good morning, ma'am!
- Good morning.

68
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:21,626
Good morning.
- Good morning.

69
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,210
Good morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

70
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,376
Yes ma'am.

71
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:39,835
Isn't Tushara on the seat?

72
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,876
All are in the Conference room
for the review meeting!

73
00:08:51,293 --> 00:08:52,043
Yes.

74
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:54,251
Ma'am, there's a call
from Actor Jayraj!

75
00:08:54,543 --> 00:08:58,251
Who'd given an interview
in our latest issue UPCOMING STAR

76
00:08:58,251 --> 00:08:59,251
Connect the call.

77
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:00,251
That person is a bit angry!

78
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:02,001
Actually, he asked for Vineeth N Pillai

79
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:04,626
As he's not available,
he asked me to connect to you.

80
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:06,376
- Connect it!
- Yes, ma'am!

81
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,085
Good morning, Mr. Jayraj!

82
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:13,376
Yes! Vineeth is our staff reporter.

83
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:19,585
I'm sorry...sorry...extremely sorry.

84
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:24,710
All are waiting for the meeting.

85
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:26,751
Has Vineeth arrived?

86
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:27,751
He'll reach!

87
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:30,126
In the interview
with new actor Jayraj,

88
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:32,126
his dad's name has been
written wrongly.

89
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:33,751
There is nothing more to say

90
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:37,001
Madam, officially Jayraj's dad's
name is Thangappan Pillai.

91
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:40,668
But Vineeth has written it <i>as</i>
Sreekaryam Ratnakaran, a stage performer

92
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:42,876
I've promised to correct it
in the next issue.

93
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:45,293
But he threatens
to break Vineeth's limbs,

94
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,626
and set ablaze the office.

95
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:49,960
Jayraj's mom was a stage artist!

96
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:52,001
Already there are rumors
that his real dad,

97
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:55,126
is Sreekaryam Ratnakaran
as Vineeth mentioned

98
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:57,876
If the same is published
in the magazine,

99
00:09:58,168 --> 00:09:59,251
won't he get angry?

100
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:00,626
O My God!

101
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:04,876
There were more calls asking if we'd
deliberately tried to insult Jayraj!

102
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:07,001
In the earlier issue also,

103
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:09,626
there was a complaint about
Vineeth's article!

104
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:10,585
That's right!

105
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,126
How can a person make
the same mistake every time?

106
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:14,876
He's too careless.

107
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:19,085
Vineeth N Pillai cares a damn
even if the sky falls down.

108
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:23,210
That ldiyankara Panchayat President
Bindu Nainan's story was started long ago.

109
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:25,751
But he keeps on postponing it.

110
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,001
Bindu Nainan had called even yesterday,

111
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,126
to know when he would come
as she was waiting !

112
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:33,501
If we say something or
even just remind him,

113
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,001
he just hates it.

114
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,585
Enough! Now let's
discuss some other topic!

115
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:47,710
Jeez! I preferred this way as
there won't be any traffic block!

116
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,501
Let me go and check.

117
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:50,751
No, you be seated!!

118
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,626
Don't ask for any trouble unnecessarily!

119
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,085
Needlessly, I don't fight with anybody.

120
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:58,126
Rosy aunty told me many
stories about you.

121
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:02,626
Give me the way.

122
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:04,501
Hey, stop there.

123
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,210
My car is running out of fuel!

124
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,876
I can't take my car until I fill it.

125
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:24,626
I'm doing that work!

126
00:11:24,876 --> 00:11:27,668
If you're in that hurry,
you fill it and park it aside.

127
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,210
Until then I'll keep honking..

128
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:33,126
Sorry!

129
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,876
What a honker!

130
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:42,876
Make it fast!

131
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:44,835
Filling petrol in the
middle of the road!

132
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:48,876
I'm only filling petrol
and not peeing, right?

133
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:51,501
Despite blocking traffic,
are you back answering?

134
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,210
OK! I'll not back answer.

135
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:57,626
My mom taught me to respect old people!!

136
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,043
Who's old?

137
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:00,710
Do you know how old I am?

138
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:03,585
Whatever it may be,
please forgive me YOUNG MAN!

139
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,251
I'll set it right in a jiffy!

140
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:08,251
Satisfied?

141
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:14,460
So, early today?

142
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:17,751
I'm early as I neither brushed teeth
nor had a bath..

143
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:19,626
- What happened to Review meeting?
- Got over long back!

144
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:20,210
Doesn't matter!

145
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:22,001
But there's one case which matters!

146
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:22,876
What's it?

147
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:27,376
In Jayraj's interview, you've written
his dad's name as Sreekaryam Ratnakaran.

148
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:29,460
But that person actually
was his mom's paramour.

149
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,501
His real dad was some
Thangappan Pillai!

150
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,251
- Has it become a problem?
- Yes

151
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:36,585
However, what I wrote
is the truth, right?

152
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:39,376
You are sure to be in trouble!

153
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:51,960
Good morning. Good morning.
Good morning.

154
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:54,543
Good morning. Hi. Hi. Hello.

155
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,585
Good morning.
- Good morning.

156
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:01,126
Good morning.
- Good morning.

157
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:02,460
Good morning.

158
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:07,710
These woman icons would've
ripped me apart in the review meeting.

159
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:10,793
Let me flay their skin one by one.

160
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:15,585
No.. "Don't go to war
when forces are less" said my mom

161
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,876
So, Vineetha N Pillai, cool down.

162
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:20,126
Hello.

163
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,126
Sorry, it's me, ma'am.

164
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,251
Okay.

165
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:34,918
What nonsense, have you done, Vineeth?

166
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,876
Don't you wish to
retain me in this office?

167
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:47,001
When interviewing a person ..minimum..

168
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:08,501
Vineethan Pillai, aren't you?

169
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:10,751
Who are you?

170
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,001
Let me be anyone!

171
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:13,376
Is that your name?

172
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:18,251
It's not Vineethan Pillai
but Vineeth N Pillai.

173
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:20,376
Even if my dad's name is outdated,
Vineeth is still modern!

174
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,251
Son of Lakshmi !

175
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,626
I was looking for you in the parking,

176
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:27,251
by then you came by lift?

177
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,251
Please come, come

178
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:33,210
Who is she? Looks familiar!

179
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:42,210
Are you going out?

180
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:45,585
We've a meeting to chart
LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE programme.

181
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,376
Madam wants everybody's presence!

182
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:48,626
At what time?

183
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:49,751
It's about to begin.

184
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,668
It'll definitely take
half an hour's time to begin.

185
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:52,251
I'll be back soon.!

186
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:53,710
I've not eaten anything.

187
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:55,751
Not even brushed my teeth!

188
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:56,835
Shucks!

189
00:14:57,293 --> 00:14:59,251
Hereafter "THARAPADH" will be
launched as E-magazine!

190
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:00,501
Printing will be stopped,

191
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:01,876
and many will lose their job.

192
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:04,876
But Kalyani is only given charge of
Vanitharathnam (Women's Magazine)

193
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:09,085
No way, madam will hand over the
entire charge and go to retired life

194
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:10,168
Oh!! Was she Kalyani?

195
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:13,043
Then what? Henceforth, it is she
who is going to manage this firm.

196
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:15,501
From London, she changed
the complete style of Vanitharatnam

197
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:18,251
Naturally Children's magazine
and Health Magazine will also change.

198
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,376
Minimum staff, Maximum quality!

199
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:21,668
That's London Style!

200
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:24,626
So if women go to London for studies,
will they become so arrogant?

201
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:30,251
Brushing and bathing in Office
will never last for long!

202
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:32,251
Kalyani's eyes may fall on you!

203
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:35,210
Those eyes have already
fallen on me, dear!

204
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,001
Haven't you finished bathing?

205
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:47,751
Will I sing then?

206
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,126
What's there to eat?

207
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,501
Shall I get you meals, Sir?
It's ready!

208
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:56,876
It's only 12.15! Doesn't matter!

209
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:01,168
Oh George! We met a long time ago.

210
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,876
- When did you arrive?
- Just a while ago.

211
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:05,876
Though I was sacked
as per the terms of VRS,

212
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:09,001
I still haven't received any allowances!

213
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:13,126
To get those paper work done,
I'd come here.

214
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:15,418
Management is planning
for a big shuffle!

215
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:16,876
I'm a prey to it!

216
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:20,751
Like how old things are thrown out
while renovating a house,

217
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:21,876
our condition is also similar to it.

218
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:24,668
Even now, when I stepped in
my heart started throbbing!

219
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:26,751
I worked here for
30 long years, haven't I?

220
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:27,793
Let me know when you're free!

221
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:28,751
We'll have a get-together!

222
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:30,751
It's 6 years since I stopped drinking!

223
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:32,126
Won't I know that?

224
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:34,751
At least for my sake!

225
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:37,501
I need to discuss a few things with you.

226
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:41,876
It's only you, who has some
affection and sympathy towards me.

227
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,876
I'll surely join and also drink.

228
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:46,001
That's enough for me.

229
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,126
- No fish fry?
- I'll get it soon

230
00:16:58,043 --> 00:17:00,668
Actually LITTLE MISS
SUNSHINE - this title,

231
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:03,335
is given to this programme
for attracting families.

232
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:07,501
Talent test for the girls,
aged between 5 - 10,

233
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:12,710
includes dancing, singing,
storytelling, poetry, quiz,

234
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:15,710
and apart from it,
a fashion show for kids!

235
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,168
Best child performer, will win
a prize money of 10 lakhs!!

236
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,251
Isn't that a bit too much?

237
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:22,960
Yes! But that's the
main attraction here.

238
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,751
Must increase the prize money
to attract Home makers of Kerala!

239
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:31,251
Vanitharatnam and Little Miss Sunshine
must be a talk in every family

240
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:34,251
We mustn't turn a blind eye
towards Visual Media's growth!

241
00:17:34,543 --> 00:17:35,501
We should fight with them.

242
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:39,251
When we just tested the changes
Kalyani made in London,

243
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:40,710
our circulation went up.

244
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,918
As she had quit everything
and come here,

245
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:46,626
definitely we can become
No.1 Publishers in Malayalam.

246
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:49,460
But I need your full support.

247
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:53,251
Though I handed over this
programme to an Event Management,

248
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:55,210
We still have some things to do.

249
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:56,293
Sorry, sorry.

250
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:57,251
Everyone will have a duty!

251
00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:58,501
Okay, then.

252
00:17:58,668 --> 00:17:59,876
We'll have another meeting tomorrow.

253
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,376
You're so irresponsible!

254
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:08,626
When there's an urgent meeting
at the office,

255
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:09,960
where were you hanging around?

256
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:14,960
Answer me! Where were you?

257
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:18,460
Sorry!

258
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,210
Started showing off the
moment she got in!

259
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:43,126
This week, there were only
4 Passport photos and one album setting.

260
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:45,585
But electricity bill has gone up!

261
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:46,751
It'll naturally increase.

262
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,126
He takes an afternoon nap with full AC.

263
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:51,210
Did you see?

264
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:53,751
When I'm back from school after 3 PM

265
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:54,501
studio will be very cool!

266
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:59,376
Hoping that you'll have a job,

267
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:03,501
I requested Baskarettan to run
this shop which he'd planned to wind up.

268
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,585
Only if you run this profitably,

269
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:07,126
You - who runs the show,

270
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:09,793
and I - who recommended you,
will have some worth!

271
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:10,501
Bro, one second!

272
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:14,210
Believing the words of one, who
pulls the leg of his Photography master,

273
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:15,751
Are you advising me?

274
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,460
Don't try to be my master!

275
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:20,293
I learn photography with the
help of Wiki.. How from the net.

276
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,376
Vicky? Which Vicky?

277
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:26,751
Go. Yes.

278
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,835
I need to take a snap
for applying UK Visa

279
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,793
- For both of you?
- No, only for me.

280
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:31,501
Please be seated.

281
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:42,126
Move away!

282
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:44,001
For UK Visa, is it?

283
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:45,501
There are certain procedures!

284
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,751
It's not like taking a
passport photograph.

285
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:51,376
I normally don't take passport photos

286
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:52,626
I'll entrust this one!

287
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:54,460
Since this is for UK...

288
00:19:57,626 --> 00:19:58,876
chin position must be correct.

289
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:00,751
Else, UK Visa will be rejected.

290
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:02,960
Ready?

291
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:08,210
Can you collect this in the morning?

292
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:10,251
- What time?
- 11.45

293
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:15,751
Mom, let's go.

294
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:19,376
Keep it! Read..

295
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:24,376
Journalists have some Corporate party
today at Le Meridian!

296
00:20:25,543 --> 00:20:26,251
How do you know?

297
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:28,960
Even I know some journalists.

298
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:31,126
Ranju from Manorama told me.

299
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:32,126
Aren't you attending?

300
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:33,626
Party will be boring!

301
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:34,876
Why don't we go for a movie?

302
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,501
Brother is neither interested
in pint nor girls!

303
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,001
That's why the party
is boring for him...

304
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:40,251
Give me the pass!

305
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:41,626
I'll get over my boredom.

306
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,876
I've taken Rs.100 for auto fare.

307
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:49,001
What am I gaining after
giving you money and drink?

308
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:49,751
Shameless fellow!

309
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:52,501
How do you tolerate him, bro?

310
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,001
I mean, how do you tolerate?

311
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:56,710
My fate!

312
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:58,501
Shall we go to a movie?

313
00:20:59,126 --> 00:20:59,876
Okay!

314
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:00,751
Shall I shut down the studio?

315
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:01,501
Yes, do it!

316
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:06,626
I don't see any amazement
in this movie!

317
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:07,668
It's just the interval!

318
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:08,918
The entire thrill is in the second half!

319
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:09,876
Let's see!

320
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:11,460
Thank you ma'am.

321
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:12,751
You don't need coffee, right?

322
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:13,876
Coffee, in Baskin Robbins?

323
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:15,626
Get an ice-cream!
Black currant!

324
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:20,501
Black currant!

325
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:22,126
Which one, sir? Large or small?

326
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:24,293
- Smaller one!
- Okay, sir.

327
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:26,085
Hello, mom! I'm along
with the tuition master.

328
00:21:26,626 --> 00:21:29,251
After shutting the studio, I'd
gone to clear my doubts with the master.

329
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:31,001
Yeah, I'm studying that

330
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:33,626
No, just 45 mints.
I'll reach home by then.

331
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:36,710
Does the movie get over by 45 mints?

332
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:38,085
You said it's a thrilling one, right?

333
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:43,501
Just taste and see.

334
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:47,876
Weren't you born and
brought up in this city?

335
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:49,335
If so..

336
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,251
Then, why no friends?

337
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:53,251
Who said I've no friends?

338
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:53,960
I've plenty!

339
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:55,126
Srikanth from Mathrubhumi

340
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,251
Unni from Malayala Manorama...
all are my friends.

341
00:21:57,543 --> 00:21:58,876
I mean girl friends.

342
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:00,376
Girlfriends?!

343
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:01,876
Just for time pass!

344
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:03,251
For a Time pass?

345
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:04,251
Eat the ice-cream quickly...

346
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:05,251
Movie will begin!

347
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:07,626
I'll punch your nose! Mind you!

348
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:11,251
LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE
- Title has become a hit.

349
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:12,460
Not only in houses,

350
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,835
In Schools also,
rehearsals are happening.

351
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,710
I'm proud of you, my child!

352
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:20,668
But I need a little more freedom.

353
00:22:20,668 --> 00:22:24,251
We must throw away
inefficient and useless fellows.

354
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:26,376
Let them freelance.

355
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:29,001
If articles are good, we'll buy it..

356
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:30,501
We'll just pay them.

357
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:35,251
Haven't we removed everyone
from your list, without any issues?

358
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:35,960
Who else is the problem?

359
00:22:36,293 --> 00:22:37,876
Vineeth is her only problem!

360
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:40,251
Did you mention Vineeth's
name on that list?

361
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:41,876
He's not a troublesome man!

362
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:42,876
Moreover, he has experience also.

363
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:44,626
Only mom supports him.

364
00:22:45,293 --> 00:22:46,710
Others have only
complaints against him.

365
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:49,085
He's the son of Lakshmi sister.

366
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:52,210
I've loyalty and
commitment towards her.

367
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:53,501
Not only me

368
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:55,501
This publication itself has!

369
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,543
What did he do to make you
so angry?

370
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,710
I dislike people who are not
loyal to their duty! !

371
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:02,835
Not only that,

372
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:07,126
For the upliftment of Women's integrity
and individuality development,

373
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:10,126
being a Panchyat President,
this Bindu Nainan

374
00:23:10,126 --> 00:23:11,251
has always focused on this issue.

375
00:23:12,668 --> 00:23:15,585
This Panchayat Governance council
which is lead by Bindu Nainan,

376
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:20,210
ls always obliged to wipe off
the tears of Poor farmers!

377
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:25,126
Bindu Nainan only tries to treat
everyone with equality

378
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:28,876
and considers all Poor workers
as her own siblings.

379
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:33,251
Why are you all giggling?
ls your father's lamp lighted here?

380
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:36,335
Close the tap!
Is it your father's property?

381
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,001
Haven't you noted down anything?

382
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,251
I'll! It's recorded in my mind!

383
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:43,835
Brother has a very good memory.

384
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:46,835
You should've got a Video Camera!

385
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:50,210
You could've written everything,
looking at me!

386
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:55,251
How does married women
influence your Panchayat?

387
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:57,876
I've still not finished
with my 1st question!

388
00:23:58,543 --> 00:24:01,501
As I'm being made a scapegoat of this
political vendetta...this Bindu Nainan

389
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:04,876
You don't have to keep on
repeating BINDU NAINAN.

390
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:07,626
People using their own name often
is a sign of,

391
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:11,710
Cheap behaviour according to us
- Journalists!

392
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:15,751
Even the Politicians frequently
repeat their names in the Channel,

393
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:18,251
Yes! The public already
knows they are ignorant!

394
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:20,043
So, I'm not!

395
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,001
Thanks for understanding.

396
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:24,626
Have you taken my photo in this dress?

397
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:26,501
Yes, long before!

398
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,001
Let me change the saree, then!

399
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:31,001
I bought 4 sarees to put
on during the interview.

400
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:34,001
Please don't mention all these!

401
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:38,376
Why are you ladies gaping?
Aren't you paid?

402
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,876
Go and work!

403
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:44,626
It's a Cover photo, right?
What about a green saree?

404
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:46,001
It's best for cover!

405
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,876
Let me also shine after
coming in the cover page

406
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,251
What a figure for the cover!

407
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:54,376
What does she think of herself?

408
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:56,960
I just lied, it's for Cover.

409
00:24:58,043 --> 00:25:01,085
Just mere words

410
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:02,626
What about Yellow color?

411
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,210
Yellow is best!

412
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:09,126
Let's start the show!

413
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:10,460
No. 1

414
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,501
Ladies and Gentlemen,
let's applaud our little stars

415
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:10,585
So, who's going to be
our Little Miss Sunshine?

416
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:32,626
How come so early?

417
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:37,876
Beautiful badge!

418
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:39,585
What's my duty?

419
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:41,751
Kalyani ma'am told us
not to assign you any duty,

420
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:43,626
and not to give you the badge too.
Put it back.

421
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:45,835
Is she so affectionate towards me?

422
00:26:47,793 --> 00:26:50,376
Those who are not assigned duty,
can watch the show, right?

423
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:55,293
You please be seated

424
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:56,335
What are you doing here?

425
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:58,376
She's my granddaughter.

426
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:00,626
- What is your sweet name, dear?
- Neena Sebastain!

427
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:01,960
I'm Vineeth N Pillai.

428
00:27:02,418 --> 00:27:05,001
As I've taken VRS from Vanitharatnam,

429
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:06,460
I got this opportunity.

430
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,626
My granddaughter can also participate.

431
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:12,376
If she wins the
prize money of 10 lakhs..

432
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:13,501
If she wins...

433
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:16,876
I'll break my vow
and both of us can enjoy.

434
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:48,751
Give me my hat!

435
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:54,126
Programme was really interesting!

436
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:56,210
Actually, I thought
it would be boring.

437
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:58,376
Excellent! You've good ideas!

438
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:02,085
Well now, it's time for the results.

439
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:05,376
The most awaited moment has come.

440
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:09,626
Our Pageant Queen is Neena Sebastian.

441
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:10,960
Thank God!

442
00:28:16,668 --> 00:28:19,751
Let's put our hands together
for our Little Miss Sunshine.

443
00:28:24,668 --> 00:28:26,001
O my loving child!

444
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:27,501
- Congratulations!
- Thank you

445
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:31,835
You did well, dear!

446
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:41,626
- How much? - 60/- Rs

447
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:44,376
- Keep 50 Rs!
- No way! I need another 10 Rs.

448
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:45,626
I usually pay 50 Rs.

449
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:47,960
How dare you threaten me?

450
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:50,251
Take it!

451
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:53,085
I didn't get the prize, mom!

452
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:57,126
You thought that you
can easily win the prize.

453
00:28:57,293 --> 00:28:59,043
You need to practice well.

454
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,376
Still, she reached up to last 5!

455
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:01,626
Many kids participated!

456
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:04,085
They deliberately didn't
give her the prize.

457
00:29:04,293 --> 00:29:05,876
When children become
more brilliant,

458
00:29:06,126 --> 00:29:07,335
Judges feel jealous!

459
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:09,001
Don't they too have children?

460
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:10,126
No way!

461
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:13,001
These are conducted
for the sake of publicity.

462
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,460
Just because you provoked her,
I sent her.

463
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:17,960
Back from office, I really felt
uncomfortable without her.

464
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:20,876
Have a bath and eat something!
Don't you've any homework?

465
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:22,251
We did the homework.

466
00:29:23,668 --> 00:29:27,376
- We?
- Not we..

467
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:28,251
...but me.

468
00:29:30,043 --> 00:29:31,210
I saw you winking!

469
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:35,168
If he helps her with homework,
then I'll change my nature.

470
00:29:35,168 --> 00:29:38,460
You definitely need a
slight change in your nature!

471
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:40,501
Come dear!

472
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:43,335
Not you, dear.

473
00:29:43,543 --> 00:29:44,251
Come Rosy!

474
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:48,585
I still have some upma.
Shall I get you?

475
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:52,085
We Christians need
rice and fish curry!

476
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:53,126
Do you have that?

477
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,376
- No
- Then, we don't need.

478
00:29:56,793 --> 00:29:59,876
Where were you
when the auto rickshaw came?

479
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:00,668
I didn't notice, sir.

480
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:03,501
Make a note of the number of the
Vehicles coming from outside.

481
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,751
And also their names. Got it?

482
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:06,376
Okay, sir.
- Go and do your duty.

483
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:08,126
Always eat rotis!

484
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:11,501
Kalyani is really smart. Best!

485
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:13,501
Keep it there.

486
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:20,251
She's a type which any guy would love!

487
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,335
But, she's arrogant.

488
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:26,376
She'd seen only useless guys
running behind her wagging their tails.

489
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:28,043
Why don't you try, brother?

490
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:30,376
Don't touch! Don't shout!
Don't speak..

491
00:30:30,376 --> 00:30:31,793
Why silence only for me?

492
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:33,168
Nobody invited you here.

493
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:35,626
You came behind me wagging
your tail like a dog.

494
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,168
I'll wag my tail.

495
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,793
Someday you'll realize it was"

496
00:30:38,793 --> 00:30:39,751
because of the affection towards you.

497
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:40,626
Get lost!

498
00:30:40,626 --> 00:30:44,251
This is Georgetta's party!
Nobody invited you here.

499
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:48,251
He invited me to discuss his sorrows.

500
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:50,543
Hosting another party for
your grand-daughter winning 1 O lakhs?

501
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:52,251
Don't shout...don't speak.

502
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:54,126
Make me clear
which mood should I follow!

503
00:30:54,543 --> 00:30:56,335
Sentiments or happy?

504
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:02,501
It wasn't needed!

505
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:03,626
Party?

506
00:31:04,668 --> 00:31:05,626
No!

507
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:07,376
I congratulated her.

508
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:09,626
I congratulated her whole heartedly!

509
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,626
But she didn't even smile!

510
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:17,376
She feels power is the
ladder to bully others

511
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,001
But, I gave a damn!

512
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:23,626
Still, it was really cheap
for a lady to behave so!

513
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:25,085
Why don't you marry somebody?

514
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:27,876
Where would I find a girl?

515
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:29,210
A great comedy!

516
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:30,626
Open your eyes wide and see!

517
00:31:30,918 --> 00:31:32,335
Isn't this the Universe of women?

518
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:35,376
Don't shout and don't speak.

519
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:38,876
- Have you ever seen my mom?
- No

520
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:40,585
Georgette had seen her!!

521
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:42,501
What a divine face!

522
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,001
Not only Divinity..

523
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:46,085
Her character..

524
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:51,585
I've never seen any girl
with my mom's qualities.

525
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,251
Rarely a few!

526
00:31:54,543 --> 00:31:56,251
But they got married earlier.

527
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,210
Don't we feel some respect
when talking about women?

528
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:02,251
This is my partner.

529
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:05,751
Shouldn't we feel proud!

530
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:09,001
Let such a woman appear before me.

531
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:10,418
I'll marry her!

532
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:11,501
How many pegs did I have?

533
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:12,335
Only 3 pegs

534
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:14,376
Only this much?

535
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:17,501
Just 3 pegs after a
long gap of 5 yrs!

536
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:20,751
Pour another 3 pegs.

537
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:31,751
What's this?

538
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:36,710
Brother!!

539
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:38,751
I'm not able to open any door.

540
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,376
I'm not able to open any door.

541
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:44,501
Yes! You can't!

542
00:32:44,668 --> 00:32:47,626
Last Sunday,
you escaped before I woke up.

543
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:51,626
Even on some holiday,
I didn't see you when I woke up.

544
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:52,501
As it's a holiday today,

545
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:55,335
I locked all the doors
otherwise you may escape.

546
00:32:57,668 --> 00:32:59,376
As you were fully boozed,

547
00:32:59,543 --> 00:33:00,376
It was me who brought you
and laid you here.

548
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:02,751
But when did you get up
and lock up the doors?

549
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:05,501
O what a responsible man!!

550
00:33:05,668 --> 00:33:07,835
Without paying any rent
and having food at my cost,

551
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:12,501
When you said you'll lie down here
without being a disturbance,

552
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:14,126
what was that condition I put forth?

553
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:15,876
Don't you remember?

554
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,376
Cleaning and washing during holidays!

555
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:18,335
Carry on.

556
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:22,876
Haven't you begun?

557
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:25,751
T-shirt not necessary.

558
00:33:25,918 --> 00:33:27,876
If you get this, you'll escape.

559
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:28,501
Please give it.

560
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:33,126
Otherwise, girls will watch me
like a complete actor.

561
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:34,751
Why don't you keep the doors shut?

562
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:36,876
You should not be
like the dog on the grass.

563
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:39,293
Green grass is essential
for cows and oxens.

564
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:42,585
Then, why don't this OX get me
ldukki style black coffee?

565
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:46,876
As I've no other way out,
I tolerate all this.

566
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:50,376
If you'd married somebody,
she would've surely killed you

567
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:52,585
Why do you tolerate so much?

568
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:53,751
You can go!

569
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,626
"When we have eyes,
we'll not know the worth of sight"

570
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:59,626
Though an old dialogue,
It has full meaning.

571
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:02,126
Solitary life...
one must live and experience!

572
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:04,376
No sentiments,

573
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,751
Do what I told. Get me the coffee.

574
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:12,251
Good!

575
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:16,335
Put my dirty clothes
in the washing machine.

576
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:19,126
You should prepare food!
It's already late.

577
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:20,376
Get going..

578
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:22,126
What a plight!!

579
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:24,626
Who's this?

580
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:28,126
"ADVOCATE DEEPA OVERAWED
COLLECTOR AND MAYOR"

581
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:35,460
Collector and Mayor bowed down
before the strike of a female advocate

582
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:40,126
who was injured when her scooter
fell in the potholes.

583
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:44,751
Advocate Deepa refused
to get up from the road

584
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,918
Unless she receives
a written statement..

585
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,335
...Road maintenance
will finish on a wartime basis

586
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:57,626
Chief Minister urged there will be an
immediate meeting regarding this

587
00:34:58,001 --> 00:34:58,960
So there's no issue!

588
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:00,460
Oh it's Ranju who photographed this!

589
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:01,876
Pick up the phone.

590
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:06,585
He looks completely annoyed today!

591
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:15,251
It's your boss

592
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:17,376
ls your cell phone switched off?

593
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:19,168
No charge in it!

594
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,126
You have to attend the
Bar Fest this evening.

595
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:25,001
Won't we get original stuff at Bar Fest?

596
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:26,001
Shall I also join you?

597
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,001
Yes! Get ready soon.

598
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:38,335
Is this a Bar Fest?

599
00:35:38,668 --> 00:35:39,710
What did you think? I was mistaken!

600
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:44,668
You could've given me a hint it's
Lawyers Association programme?

601
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:47,710
Then I couldn't have seen an
embarrassed face like this!

602
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:56,710
- Bro, shall I be..
- No, sit down here.

603
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,376
What business does a cat have...

604
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:00,585
Don't shout...
Don't speak. Keep quiet!

605
00:36:00,793 --> 00:36:02,751
- Is the speech over?
- Yes, long back. Lucky!

606
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:05,085
Don't forget! Tonight! I'll be back.

607
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:09,960
Excuse me.

608
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,085
What to say!

609
00:36:12,626 --> 00:36:14,751
When a sensational photograph
appears in the newspaper.

610
00:36:14,918 --> 00:36:16,751
You know the mileage,
which a photographer earns.

611
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:19,251
Everybody talks about only that.

612
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:20,876
You didn't see the photograph
in the paper?

613
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:22,001
Yes, of course!

614
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:23,876
What an impact!

615
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:25,376
It was quite sensational on the T.V

616
00:36:25,668 --> 00:36:28,001
And this was the discussion
on all Channels!

617
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:30,876
The name which was unknown
till yesterday...

618
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:32,251
...Advocate Deepa...

619
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:32,918
...Who's she today..

620
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:33,710
- Who?
- A star!

621
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,126
The Chief Minister called
an urgent meeting

622
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:38,376
Seems High Court will interfere if Road

623
00:36:38,543 --> 00:36:40,210
Maintenance work isn't
completed immediately.

624
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:41,626
It really worked out!

625
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,876
Oh. Okay See you later

626
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:47,126
Did you notice his arrogance!

627
00:36:47,668 --> 00:36:48,668
Okay, then let's..

628
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:50,251
Don't shout ! I'll give you a bang!

629
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:53,751
Dear friends, now
Advocate Deepa on the stage!

630
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:33,960
"In front of Krishna
even if Gopis dance,"

631
00:37:39,251 --> 00:37:44,710
"On his bosom even if they lean,"

632
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:48,085
"Like the peacock feather,"

633
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:50,501
"Like the beautiful flute,"

634
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:53,335
"Like the basil in Ambadi,"

635
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:55,960
"Like the platter of butter,"

636
00:37:56,293 --> 00:37:58,460
"Your love is like river Yamuna,"

637
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:06,876
"O Radha, daughter of Yadava clan,“

638
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:11,876
"For Krishna you are his floral garland"

639
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:17,793
"O Radha, daughter of Yadava clan,“

640
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:24,001
"For Krishna you are his floral garland"

641
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:49,626
"Is it black cloud or is it night,“

642
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:55,126
"Your beautiful tresses, Radha?"

643
00:38:55,501 --> 00:39:00,876
"Is it the fragrance of Ketaka flower
or champak flower"

644
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:05,751
"On your body"

645
00:39:05,918 --> 00:39:10,835
"Beautiful friend,
Always God will give you happiness"

646
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:16,335
"The people of Ambadi always happily
know your footsteps"

647
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:19,293
"Tell us whether the sound of flute"

648
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:21,876
"ls full of love or Cupid's call?“

649
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,501
"In Yamuna, is it melodious songs,"

650
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:27,376
"Sweet separation or intoxication?"

651
00:39:27,543 --> 00:39:30,126
"O beloved of Yadava clan
Lover of Krishna,"

652
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:32,376
"Lovely as a swan,"

653
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:46,210
"In front of Krishna,
let Gopis dance"

654
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:56,751
"In front of Krishna,
let Gopis dance"

655
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:08,126
Not good enough! Not up to mark!

656
00:40:08,418 --> 00:40:10,835
Excellent performance! Super!

657
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:14,585
Do you've any idea
about Classical dance?

658
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:17,126
Can she be compared to
Padma Subramanyam?

659
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:18,876
Mudras slipped off from her hands!

660
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:21,085
When? Oh my God! I didn't notice!

661
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:24,126
Advocate Ravi Shankar
will present a song.

662
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:26,626
You be seated!

663
00:40:27,418 --> 00:40:29,126
What am I to do sitting here?

664
00:40:33,293 --> 00:40:34,626
Check whether stitches have broken?

665
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:36,376
No. It hasn't broken.

666
00:40:36,543 --> 00:40:38,626
We shall again see the
doctor on our way.

667
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:40,376
Blood still seeps out!

668
00:40:43,126 --> 00:40:44,876
Advocate, you've a great will power.

669
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,251
The injury when you fell
into the pothole, right?

670
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:50,751
If this photograph appears in
tomorrow papers, as box news...

671
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:53,251
Then, it'll be the continuation
of last days' sensation.

672
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,251
Who asked you to take
photograph in the green room?

673
00:40:55,251 --> 00:40:57,126
Didn't you recognize me? I'm Ranju.

674
00:40:57,418 --> 00:40:59,376
The photo that came in today's Metro
was taken by me!

675
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,585
Oh! Was that you?

676
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:02,126
If you belong to press,

677
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,585
does that mean you can take
photographs at any private place?

678
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:05,751
Better delete it!

679
00:41:05,918 --> 00:41:07,293
That's madam.

680
00:41:07,293 --> 00:41:08,751
I asked you to delete!

681
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:10,001
I'll not publish it
if you're not interested.

682
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,126
Delete it, I say.

683
00:41:11,751 --> 00:41:12,876
- It's done.-Get away!

684
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:14,876
You saw this?

685
00:41:15,918 --> 00:41:16,751
Yes!

686
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:20,001
This time,
our Golden Jubilee Special highlight

687
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:21,751
should be her interview!

688
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:27,001
An ordinary home maker has become
a talk of the town in a single day

689
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,876
Entire Society's attention
is drawn towards her!.

690
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:31,335
Her real life which is
unknown to the media,

691
00:41:31,543 --> 00:41:33,710
her dreams and attitude
- are all what we need!

692
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:38,876
If your observation is also
there about her..

693
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:39,960
It'll be a great story.

694
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:43,251
That's the reason I insisted you to
watch yesterday's programme.

695
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:48,876
Are you entrusting him
with Advocate Deepa's story?

696
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:49,626
Yes

697
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:51,876
No, we'll send some new person.

698
00:41:52,168 --> 00:41:53,710
He'll not do this

699
00:41:55,168 --> 00:41:56,626
Without accomplishing my tasks,

700
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:57,626
How can I last here
for these many years?

701
00:41:57,918 --> 00:41:59,668
According to me, you're a lazy fellow.

702
00:41:59,668 --> 00:42:01,460
...evades from responsibilities!

703
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:04,710
Only we must get
Deepa's matter as exclusive!

704
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:06,793
You don't have that talent
and patience for the job.

705
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:10,210
Madam, please go through the
issues of Vanitharathnam.

706
00:42:10,793 --> 00:42:14,251
And analyze who has the most
readers for the write-ups!

707
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:18,960
Please find out who has written the main
stories of the most sold out issues,

708
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:20,501
And then you can evaluate.

709
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:23,668
After studying in London,
reading magazines in New York,

710
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:25,126
And having Japanese readers in mind,

711
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,751
don' t try to assess
our Malayali readers

712
00:42:27,418 --> 00:42:30,126
For that you must understand the culture
and worth of experienced people.

713
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:33,001
When others didn't object you,
don't take it as your greatness!

714
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:34,376
Have a little modesty...

715
00:42:34,376 --> 00:42:35,001
...At least in your mind.

716
00:42:35,168 --> 00:42:35,960
You're talented!

717
00:42:36,168 --> 00:42:37,626
You've a future...so...

718
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:40,126
I've taken up this job.

719
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:57,751
Absolutely there is no
bonafides, Your Honour!!

720
00:42:58,293 --> 00:43:01,210
Plaintiff is changing the
facts at his own will!

721
00:43:01,418 --> 00:43:03,376
In short, he is twisting the facts

722
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:05,376
Based on the petition
filed under alimony,

723
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:07,376
This person says he is
really feeble and poor!

724
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:10,751
Seems his daily income
is less than Rs.100,

725
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:12,501
that too, only when he has a job..

726
00:43:12,918 --> 00:43:14,960
At the same time regarding
the custody of the child,

727
00:43:15,168 --> 00:43:18,001
he seems to be more healthy and rich!

728
00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:23,835
It's quite evident to the court that
he is lying according to the situation

729
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,251
Therefore,
my humble submission is that..

730
00:43:26,543 --> 00:43:27,876
Maintenance may be allowed,

731
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:31,001
and custody petition may be dismissed
with compensatory cost!

732
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:33,751
Hello! Congratulations!

733
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,043
My argument is just over.

734
00:43:35,043 --> 00:43:36,001
It's not about that matter.

735
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:39,210
High Court itself filed a
case to repair roads.

736
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:41,876
It was only because of your reaction.

737
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:43,501
That is good! See you.

738
00:43:45,668 --> 00:43:46,376
Advocate!

739
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,751
Why are you behind me?

740
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,835
Kochouseph Chithilapally
is waiting in the office.

741
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:53,751
Why?

742
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:57,126
He is going to announce a
reward of 5 lakhs!

743
00:43:57,418 --> 00:43:59,293
Press meet is at
3' O clock this evening.

744
00:43:59,293 --> 00:44:01,460
Before that, he wants to talk to you.

745
00:44:01,793 --> 00:44:02,626
Greetings!

746
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:04,001
We're meeting for the 1st time.

747
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:05,835
But I know you very well!

748
00:44:06,168 --> 00:44:07,376
Heard a lot about you.

749
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:08,126
This man..

750
00:44:09,126 --> 00:44:10,960
Yes, Ranju told me everything.

751
00:44:11,376 --> 00:44:13,876
I hardly achieved anything
to get this reward.

752
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,001
I just took a stand in that situation!

753
00:44:17,418 --> 00:44:20,335
But I neither wish to be known,
nor receive the reward.

754
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:23,460
No. This is an inspiration for others.

755
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:27,626
Here an individual becomes
a role model for the society.

756
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:28,876
That's what we support!

757
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:31,751
I'm well aware of all your philanthropic
activities towards the people.

758
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:34,376
Only great hearted people can do this.

759
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:35,710
I admire that.

760
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:40,001
But I've sufficient <i>cases</i> and clients.

761
00:44:40,668 --> 00:44:43,751
If you offer this to someone who
deserves it more than me,

762
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:44,960
I'll be really delighted.

763
00:44:45,293 --> 00:44:46,876
Good! You're a great lady!

764
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:54,460
Don't be offended if I say the fact.

765
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:58,251
Of late, whatever tasks
I'd begun after breaking coconuts

766
00:44:58,418 --> 00:44:59,376
have ended only in a mess.

767
00:44:59,668 --> 00:45:01,751
Will put me in some fix.

768
00:45:02,168 --> 00:45:03,335
Shall I ask you one doubt?

769
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:05,251
"Any dog..

770
00:45:05,793 --> 00:45:07,751
Has its day" is the saying.

771
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:10,501
That means a day of happiness.

772
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:12,376
Then, why don't you mind me?

773
00:45:17,668 --> 00:45:18,626
Why are you giggling?

774
00:45:19,001 --> 00:45:20,126
Haven't you seen people praying before?

775
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:21,126
Carry on.

776
00:45:22,168 --> 00:45:24,251
See this!! An obstacle even for praying!

777
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:25,876
Vigneswaran is your name!

778
00:45:26,876 --> 00:45:29,335
This interview is my
prestige pressure cooker!

779
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:32,335
Please...Please help me.

780
00:45:38,293 --> 00:45:39,126
How come you're here?

781
00:45:39,501 --> 00:45:41,418
As you couldn't get a
staff photographer...

782
00:45:41,418 --> 00:45:42,001
So..

783
00:45:42,168 --> 00:45:43,251
For interview...

784
00:45:43,251 --> 00:45:45,126
I'm going to seek
permission for her interview.

785
00:45:45,293 --> 00:45:46,293
Right, but..

786
00:45:46,293 --> 00:45:48,126
Suppose she gives permission
to do it immediately,

787
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:49,376
Still, I don't need you.

788
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:52,876
I've been in trouble
wherever I've taken you.

789
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:55,460
Please don't talk like that.

790
00:45:56,793 --> 00:45:58,376
I've changed my line completely.

791
00:45:59,043 --> 00:45:59,835
Don't open the door..

792
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:02,501
If you do,
I'll chop your hands and legs.

793
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:03,501
Get lost.

794
00:46:31,793 --> 00:46:34,251
Remember, it's a housing colony!

795
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:35,876
Houses are close by!

796
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,835
Women live in all these houses.

797
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:39,876
While staring at women, you salivate,

798
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:41,168
like a rat luring for grain!

799
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:42,460
With that, they'll know your standard!

800
00:46:42,668 --> 00:46:44,293
You've said this plenty of times.

801
00:46:44,293 --> 00:46:45,751
But you've still not understood.

802
00:46:45,918 --> 00:46:47,751
We must be decent, understand?

803
00:46:48,043 --> 00:46:50,210
Watch me this time!
I'll be double decent.

804
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:11,876
Oh my God! 2 strands of grey hair!

805
00:47:12,793 --> 00:47:15,876
I feel embarrassed to color
my hair at this old age.

806
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:18,876
Those who are younger than me
walk around with grey hair.

807
00:47:19,293 --> 00:47:22,710
They wouldn't have
got an affectionate husband like me.

808
00:47:23,293 --> 00:47:26,251
My wife still looks sweet 17!

809
00:47:26,418 --> 00:47:28,501
Sweet 17!!

810
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:32,626
People who know us, also know
that we're retired Govt. Servants

811
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:33,960
It's correct in my case.

812
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:38,418
Since your dad gave your age
incorrect in your school,

813
00:47:38,418 --> 00:47:40,210
you were forced to retire early.

814
00:47:41,043 --> 00:47:42,251
Otherwise, even now..

815
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:45,001
I would be hearing
your sweet voice in All India Radio.

816
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:51,501
"Hey Queen! Come let us sing a song."

817
00:47:51,876 --> 00:47:58,751
"When I am sleeping,
your voice wakes me up"

818
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:05,251
"When I am sleeping,
your voice wakes me up"

819
00:48:06,293 --> 00:48:08,210
O my God!

820
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:11,501
Who's over there?

821
00:48:14,418 --> 00:48:15,501
Who's that?

822
00:48:15,918 --> 00:48:18,501
It's me Vineeth! Vineeth N Pillai!

823
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:19,251
Journalist!

824
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:20,960
What did you say?

825
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:22,585
Greetings!

826
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:24,001
I'm Vineeth!

827
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:25,043
You dirty creep!

828
00:48:25,043 --> 00:48:28,376
Pretending to be decent
after peeping in?

829
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:29,751
Who peeped in?

830
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:32,126
I saw with both my eyes,

831
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:33,876
you peeped through the window curtain.

832
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:34,626
Aren't you ashamed?

833
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:37,251
When a couple is loving,
aren't you ashamed of gaping?

834
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:40,168
I just came to check whether
there is anyone in that house.

835
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:42,626
Checking about that house in this house?

836
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:44,501
- You please come.
- Leave me.

837
00:48:45,043 --> 00:48:46,960
I've been watching him for a long time.

838
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:49,626
Whenever we get into the room
and lock the door...

839
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:50,793
I hear someone's footsteps outside.

840
00:48:50,793 --> 00:48:52,126
I've noticed it earlier also.

841
00:48:52,293 --> 00:48:54,126
Is - anything really happening?
Nothing!

842
00:48:55,876 --> 00:48:57,751
Hello, I'm here for the first time

843
00:48:58,043 --> 00:49:00,418
I've seen this fellow somewhere!

844
00:49:00,418 --> 00:49:01,543
What's the problem?

845
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:03,376
He was peeping through window.

846
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:04,918
Was that him?

847
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:06,626
Can't you make out by his looks?

848
00:49:06,626 --> 00:49:08,460
Day before yesterday,
when I was bathing,

849
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:10,918
I too saw a head through the Ventilator.

850
00:49:10,918 --> 00:49:12,251
That head is this head!

851
00:49:12,543 --> 00:49:16,210
Did you think Dubai people's
wives are ready for anything?

852
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:17,626
Guard!

853
00:49:18,793 --> 00:49:20,835
A thief has come to catch the women!

854
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:21,876
Come quickly.

855
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:23,251
Where are you?

856
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,626
Making rotis?

857
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:28,251
I'm not the person you are intending.
I'm a journalist.

858
00:49:28,251 --> 00:49:30,251
Thieves even say they are CBI people.

859
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:31,210
Here's my Identity card.

860
00:49:31,418 --> 00:49:32,501
Take it out.

861
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:33,668
Take it out I say.

862
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:35,751
I forgot to take my identity card.

863
00:49:36,543 --> 00:49:39,085
Many people had been
here with many excuses.

864
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:41,126
Mom! The thief is caught!

865
00:49:41,126 --> 00:49:42,001
- Where?
- See!

866
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:43,251
He peeped while I was bathing.

867
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:45,460
Tell me the truth.
Why did you come here?

868
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:49,376
I'm not the person you intend!

869
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:50,960
Then, who are you?

870
00:49:51,918 --> 00:49:53,751
Since a long time..

871
00:49:56,918 --> 00:49:58,585
Stop..stop

872
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:00,876
Call the police! Let them come.

873
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:01,876
I'll talk to the Police.

874
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:03,585
Yes, I'll call
- Okay call Police

875
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,376
Police haven't been to this
colony until now.

876
00:50:05,543 --> 00:50:07,376
Let them come now. Call them..

877
00:50:07,793 --> 00:50:09,501
Let them also know,
you're turning a goat into a dog!

878
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:10,918
Leave it!

879
00:50:10,918 --> 00:50:12,460
If this issue is made public
it's a shame to the colony.

880
00:50:12,668 --> 00:50:14,001
Get lost, you thief!

881
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:18,793
Don't threaten.

882
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:20,001
- I'll come again.
- When?

883
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:22,376
Vineeth N Pillai will never
get scared of Paper tiger!

884
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:23,876
Understood!!

885
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:27,210
Leave me.

886
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,126
He's not Mathan!
But Pothan(Buffalo)

887
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:49,501
He mustn't step into this house.

888
00:50:49,876 --> 00:50:51,585
There's a limit for one's tolerance!

889
00:51:14,668 --> 00:51:15,501
Brother, please..

890
00:51:18,918 --> 00:51:19,960
You'll get the rest later!

891
00:51:20,293 --> 00:51:21,376
Don't think everything
has ended by this.

892
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:30,251
What happened?

893
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:31,376
Actually, you were supposed to
get the thrashings.

894
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:32,960
- Me?
- Yes.

895
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:34,960
They had come in search of you.

896
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:37,001
But found only me.

897
00:51:37,376 --> 00:51:38,251
Who are they?

898
00:51:38,418 --> 00:51:40,960
Didn't you make a mistake
in the dad's name of an actor...

899
00:51:41,251 --> 00:51:43,376
Rajeev...what was his name..

900
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:44,710
Jayrai...

901
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:46,626
They were his people!

902
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:50,335
Unfortunately, I came with
you for taking photograph that day!

903
00:51:50,668 --> 00:51:52,418
Oh God! They smacked me to a pulp!

904
00:51:52,418 --> 00:51:53,126
See this..

905
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:53,876
Where?

906
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:54,626
Have you seen this?

907
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:59,960
Now, this second , I understood
that proverb is true

908
00:52:00,293 --> 00:52:02,501
"As you sow, so you reap!"
How correct it is!

909
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:03,918
Please don't hurt this corpse!

910
00:52:03,918 --> 00:52:05,126
So, you know that you're one!

911
00:52:05,418 --> 00:52:06,960
Then, come..
Will you be able to walk?

912
00:52:07,251 --> 00:52:08,876
Come here!

913
00:52:17,543 --> 00:52:20,335
So, you were planning to
throw me out, didn't you?

914
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:22,001
Yes!

915
00:52:27,418 --> 00:52:30,626
Bro, you're very hard hearted!

916
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:34,293
You always say that you'd
never been happy in your life.

917
00:52:34,293 --> 00:52:35,501
- You know why?
- Why?

918
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:38,376
Only those who have compassion
will have happiness

919
00:52:38,793 --> 00:52:40,376
And those who are generous,
will have Peace!

920
00:52:40,626 --> 00:52:41,710
These were said in the Bible

921
00:52:41,918 --> 00:52:48,001
You escaped from my thrashings
as you'd enough from them.

922
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:50,126
I thought you shouldn't
get beaten up by all.

923
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:54,585
"A thankless dog should be beaten up,

924
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:56,710
and made toothless",
says the Bhagavad Gita.

925
00:52:56,918 --> 00:52:58,876
Is there too much of
violence in Bhagavad Gita?

926
00:53:01,668 --> 00:53:02,460
Get lost!

927
00:53:03,043 --> 00:53:04,126
I said, get lost!

928
00:53:05,043 --> 00:53:07,585
Always blames me for whatever I say!
What sort of a person he is!

929
00:53:20,918 --> 00:53:24,001
Please show me the way
to reach Advocate Deepa, Sir!

930
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:48,501
"O Dawn-flower girl,
clad in warm sunlight“

931
00:53:48,668 --> 00:53:50,626
"Whither, as usual?"

932
00:53:51,293 --> 00:53:53,751
"Tying the tresses on top,
swaying your hands,"

933
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:55,626
"Whither, shaking violently?“

934
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:59,251
"Are you a breeze which slips away

935
00:53:59,543 --> 00:54:01,585
even if you come softly?“

936
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:07,001
“Are you a beautiful
moon flaming inside?"

937
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:09,376
"O Dawn-flower girl,
clad in warm sunlight“

938
00:54:09,626 --> 00:54:11,376
"whither, as usual?“

939
00:54:12,168 --> 00:54:14,585
"Tying the tresses on top,
swaying your hands,"

940
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,960
"whither, shaking violently?“

941
00:54:46,543 --> 00:54:51,335
"Are you a lamp of love with spikes,"

942
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:56,501
"Or a love song full of wounds?“

943
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:06,960
"Are you a cloud wandering
not knowing the boundary"

944
00:55:07,376 --> 00:55:11,960
"Or a dew drop walking in darkness?"

945
00:55:12,168 --> 00:55:16,876
"You are always smiling
on an unreachable branch"

946
00:55:17,376 --> 00:55:22,251
"You are a touch-me-not plant
which pricks with its thorns"

947
00:55:22,626 --> 00:55:25,168
"Are you a day-dream which
disappears suddenly

948
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:27,376
"when just about to touch"

949
00:55:27,793 --> 00:55:30,251
"O Dawn-flower girl,
clad in warm sunlight“

950
00:55:30,418 --> 00:55:31,960
"whither, as usual?“

951
00:55:33,043 --> 00:55:35,668
"Tying the tresses on top,
swaying your hands,"

952
00:55:35,668 --> 00:55:37,376
"whither, shaking violently?“

953
00:56:09,918 --> 00:56:14,626
"Are you a shore where memories roam"

954
00:56:15,168 --> 00:56:17,585
Isn't that Vytila Byju
a Quotation Goonda?

955
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:20,126
Yes!! The other guy is
Pachalam Simon, right?

956
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:26,126
I pursued LLB, spending lots of money.

957
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:27,960
Pay my fees and go.

958
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:35,626
"What is this magically felling"

959
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:40,793
"I feel like seeing you everywhere.
I feel like talking to all the time"

960
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:45,626
"Is this love or a beginning
of new friendship"

961
00:56:45,918 --> 00:56:50,501
"Whatever it is it is beautiful.
Come let us enjoy together"

962
00:56:51,293 --> 00:56:53,751
"Now it is raining and running
around the trees are fun"

963
00:56:53,918 --> 00:56:55,960
"Come let us bring
the child within us"

964
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:57,251
MY Son!

965
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:59,293
After snatching the house and property,

966
00:56:59,293 --> 00:57:00,626
he threw me out.

967
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:03,751
Don't worry!
We'll settle it out of the Court.

968
00:57:08,543 --> 00:57:10,626
Advocate,
this is absolutely free for you!

969
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:25,626
Get down slowly.

970
00:57:28,043 --> 00:57:30,001
You needn't have come here
in this condition.

971
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:32,460
You could've signed it in the hospital!

972
00:57:33,001 --> 00:57:37,335
No! I must take the trouble
to rectify my mistakes!

973
00:57:38,376 --> 00:57:39,460
Right, bro?

974
00:57:40,376 --> 00:57:43,335
Knowing he met with an accident,
I rushed to the hospital.

975
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,501
Doctor said there's nothing to worry.

976
00:57:45,876 --> 00:57:48,751
However, with that,
my son has reformed!

977
00:57:48,918 --> 00:57:50,501
Anyhow, you're happy, aren't you?

978
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:53,835
Until your death, nobody will
throw you out of your house.

979
00:57:54,043 --> 00:57:56,585
I'm very tired, shall I

980
00:57:57,168 --> 00:57:57,960
OK then...Please hold me.

981
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:06,335
What's this?

982
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:08,543
If you give me the entire money,

983
00:58:08,543 --> 00:58:09,710
What will you do if any need arises?

984
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:12,626
Please accept it for my satisfaction.

985
00:58:14,251 --> 00:58:15,876
- Do you visit the Guruvayur temple?
- Yes of course

986
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:20,876
When you go there next time,
offer Rs.101 and worship God.

987
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:22,210
You'll get the satisfaction.

988
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:28,501
Come quickly, mom!

989
00:58:32,626 --> 00:58:33,251
Vanitharathnam!

990
00:58:34,418 --> 00:58:35,126
Sorry!

991
00:58:35,543 --> 00:58:37,251
Vanitharathnam! Staff reporter.

992
00:58:37,668 --> 00:58:39,251
Vineeth N Pillai!

993
00:58:42,168 --> 00:58:43,626
I know you're a busy person.

994
00:58:43,918 --> 00:58:47,001
I've been struggling for
long to meet you.

995
00:58:47,251 --> 00:58:50,251
However, your time management,
it's amazing!

996
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:50,960
I must really appreciate!

997
00:58:51,168 --> 00:58:52,543
You find time for all activities!

998
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,960
Don't even skip a dance practice!

999
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:55,751
My mom was also like this.

1000
00:58:56,418 --> 00:58:59,126
She never gives an excuse
of "no time" to anyone!

1001
00:58:59,126 --> 00:59:02,210
She always fights for justice!

1002
00:59:02,418 --> 00:59:04,126
No matter, it's a tiger
or a donkey in front.

1003
00:59:04,293 --> 00:59:05,251
She doesn't care.

1004
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,001
What do you want?

1005
00:59:08,543 --> 00:59:09,751
Very important question.

1006
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:13,501
This is Vanithrathnam!

1007
00:59:15,876 --> 00:59:18,293
A family magazine - widely read,
still reading

1008
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:20,751
and wishing to read by the
people in Kerala!

1009
00:59:21,168 --> 00:59:22,126
I'm its staff reporter.

1010
00:59:23,168 --> 00:59:23,960
Take..

1011
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:27,376
This is old style!

1012
00:59:27,751 --> 00:59:29,501
A new style with a changed
outlook is coming up!

1013
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:32,251
This year, it's the golden jubilee
of our publication.

1014
00:59:32,543 --> 00:59:34,626
In this regard, we're also
planning a special edition.

1015
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:36,376
Which includes your cover story

1016
00:59:36,751 --> 00:59:38,710
And my write-up about you.

1017
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:41,376
Our Editorial board has
already taken a decision!.

1018
00:59:41,793 --> 00:59:42,751
I've no interest.

1019
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:47,001
You've no habit of saying
"no time"

1020
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:49,376
I shall work adjusting to your time.

1021
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:50,126
Let's not have this in one go.

1022
00:59:50,126 --> 00:59:51,043
Take your own time.

1023
00:59:51,043 --> 00:59:53,668
Truth is that If you show an
interest in any subject,

1024
00:59:53,668 --> 00:59:55,376
Then, you'll find
everything interesting.

1025
00:59:55,376 --> 00:59:58,960
To tell the fact, I've come across
many women characters in my career.

1026
00:59:59,418 --> 01:00:03,501
But to be very frank, only very
few women have touched me.

1027
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:06,960
Sorry, I never meant so.

1028
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:08,710
They touched my heart.

1029
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:12,668
Feature of New actor Jayaraj's
interview was written by me.

1030
01:00:12,668 --> 01:00:13,376
It's not good.

1031
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:14,626
It's because he has no depth.

1032
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:16,001
Still read this.

1033
01:00:16,001 --> 01:00:17,751
Not necessarily now...
Call me after that.

1034
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:18,876
Take down my number.

1035
01:00:19,418 --> 01:00:20,626
Any time...all the time...

1036
01:00:20,793 --> 01:00:21,710
I'm free for your call.

1037
01:00:22,001 --> 01:00:23,626
You never seem to stop!

1038
01:00:23,876 --> 01:00:25,001
I already told you I'm not interested.

1039
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:27,251
This is going to be an
important feature!

1040
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:28,835
What is your problem, then?

1041
01:00:35,126 --> 01:00:37,585
Oh! Do you bring food from home?

1042
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,085
I take food from the hotel
in the afternoon.

1043
01:00:39,293 --> 01:00:40,876
When mom was alive, she
never used to allow that!

1044
01:00:41,043 --> 01:00:42,043
She always used to
pack my food from home!

1045
01:00:42,043 --> 01:00:43,751
But I'm also fond of homely food.

1046
01:00:44,418 --> 01:00:48,710
Is there any reason for
being disinterested?

1047
01:00:49,168 --> 01:00:50,251
Will you leave me if
I give you a reason?

1048
01:00:50,251 --> 01:00:51,376
I never meant so.

1049
01:00:51,668 --> 01:00:53,001
Don't you need a valid reason?

1050
01:00:53,543 --> 01:00:54,751
- Reason..
- OK come on

1051
01:00:55,543 --> 01:00:59,376
I don't like the Sandal paste
on your forehead. Enough!?

1052
01:00:59,668 --> 01:01:01,501
No, it's a joke! You're joking.

1053
01:01:01,668 --> 01:01:02,501
Mr. Vineethan Pillai...

1054
01:01:02,668 --> 01:01:03,960
Vineeth N Pillai... Okay carry on..

1055
01:01:04,126 --> 01:01:04,876
- Get..
- Please don't..

1056
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:05,960
You meant "Get out', right?

1057
01:01:06,293 --> 01:01:10,543
Nobody needs to say "Get out“ to
a 20 yrs experienced Journalist,

1058
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:11,501
and should never say so.

1059
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,751
But he must understand it
without saying.

1060
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:17,668
But I can't leave you.

1061
01:01:17,668 --> 01:01:19,293
I'll come and can't avoid coming.

1062
01:01:19,293 --> 01:01:20,626
If you trouble me,
I'll complain to the Police!

1063
01:01:20,793 --> 01:01:22,876
We Journalist, especially me,
have no fear of police.

1064
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,960
Here is the Advocate..
Let's talk to her.

1065
01:01:32,418 --> 01:01:33,251
Mom, this also.

1066
01:01:34,126 --> 01:01:35,710
Don't you've many such dolls at home?

1067
01:01:36,043 --> 01:01:38,126
No mom, this is different!

1068
01:01:38,543 --> 01:01:40,376
Whatever it may be,
we'll buy it later.

1069
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:42,001
Good morning, Madam!

1070
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:43,876
Good morning.

1071
01:01:43,876 --> 01:01:45,876
I've seen you in Advocate
Nambiar's office.

1072
01:01:46,876 --> 01:01:48,835
Yes, I too have seen you.

1073
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:50,460
Are you busy?

1074
01:01:50,668 --> 01:01:51,501
No, Why?

1075
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:54,126
I'd been working as a nurse in Germany.

1076
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:56,251
I worked for nearly 36 yrs!

1077
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:59,501
I made some money after working
two or three shifts relentlessly.

1078
01:02:00,293 --> 01:02:01,626
It was all for my family.

1079
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:03,376
We suffered a lot of hardships!

1080
01:02:04,168 --> 01:02:07,251
With our entire savings,
we bought a villa here,

1081
01:02:08,043 --> 01:02:10,210
hoping to live the
rest of our life here!

1082
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,251
Relying on the promoter's advertisements

1083
01:02:12,418 --> 01:02:14,460
We bought this even before
they'd begun their project.

1084
01:02:14,793 --> 01:02:16,251
But when we came here...

1085
01:02:17,293 --> 01:02:19,335
It was not like the one seen
in photos and videos.

1086
01:02:19,876 --> 01:02:23,001
Somewhere far away from City
..a small cement building on the hill.

1087
01:02:23,376 --> 01:02:25,210
We were duped, saying Luxury villa!!

1088
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:26,501
Which group had built it?

1089
01:02:26,793 --> 01:02:27,835
G M Builders!

1090
01:02:29,418 --> 01:02:31,335
It's enough if I get back my money.

1091
01:02:31,626 --> 01:02:32,960
We don't even get water there!

1092
01:02:33,418 --> 01:02:34,626
A building without strong foundation!

1093
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,960
And it'll be just around 5 lakhs!

1094
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:39,501
How much did you pay?

1095
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:40,626
50 lakhs!

1096
01:02:42,293 --> 01:02:43,668
Though the advocacy was signed,

1097
01:02:43,668 --> 01:02:45,751
I don't understand
why it's still not been filed!

1098
01:02:46,293 --> 01:02:47,376
I shall check with him.

1099
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:49,835
We'd come to see a doctor.

1100
01:02:50,501 --> 01:02:51,960
At that time,
I saw you entering the shop.

1101
01:02:52,876 --> 01:02:54,751
After toiling hard throughout my life,

1102
01:02:55,168 --> 01:02:57,251
When I imagine our plight
at our last stage..

1103
01:03:32,168 --> 01:03:34,335
Hi Farah! So, that was you?

1104
01:03:34,918 --> 01:03:36,751
Who else has the guts to
play pranks on you?

1105
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:38,376
Sara aunty.
- Dear.

1106
01:03:39,293 --> 01:03:41,043
Is this your new car, aunty?

1107
01:03:41,043 --> 01:03:42,251
Yes! You liked it?

1108
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:43,460
Hmm...nice.

1109
01:03:43,668 --> 01:03:45,668
Did you self drive
all the way from Palakkad?

1110
01:03:45,668 --> 01:03:46,710
Then what?

1111
01:03:48,668 --> 01:03:51,626
Does anybody tease you calling "Meow"

1112
01:03:52,043 --> 01:03:52,751
No.

1113
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:54,293
They do! I'm sure.

1114
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:55,251
Never!

1115
01:03:55,543 --> 01:03:57,001
It was your mom's obstinacy!

1116
01:03:57,376 --> 01:04:00,126
Or else will anybody christen
the child as MIA?

1117
01:04:03,376 --> 01:04:05,210
You'd seen her 3-4 months back, right?

1118
01:04:05,418 --> 01:04:07,376
Now her punch is very powerful!
Beware!

1119
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,210
Oh really? Let me see!

1120
01:04:08,668 --> 01:04:09,585
Park the Vehicle here.

1121
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:13,376
Without even a call,
why this sudden visit...?

1122
01:04:13,668 --> 01:04:15,251
Didn't I give you a surprise ?

1123
01:04:16,376 --> 01:04:17,876
Wait, wait I will give.

1124
01:04:22,043 --> 01:04:23,251
So many covers?

1125
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:24,751
Hope you'd a big shopping?

1126
01:04:24,918 --> 01:04:25,876
Tomorrow is her birthday.

1127
01:04:26,043 --> 01:04:27,501
Went to buy a dress for her.

1128
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:29,001
Also got two churidhars for myself.

1129
01:04:29,293 --> 01:04:30,376
Let me see.

1130
01:04:34,626 --> 01:04:35,751
Pretty!

1131
01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:38,126
Not bad! Good price!

1132
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:41,501
Many people from Palakkad
come to Lulu for shopping.

1133
01:04:42,168 --> 01:04:45,043
When customers from Palakkad
can come all the way from there,

1134
01:04:45,043 --> 01:04:46,751
then, what's the point of
running a boutique there?

1135
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:50,210
So, visiting Lulu is
your main target?

1136
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:54,251
I want to know the items
which attract people more!

1137
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:56,751
And fly to Rajasthan!

1138
01:04:57,251 --> 01:04:58,751
Rajasthan?

1139
01:04:59,251 --> 01:05:01,960
Would like to make more
purchases of rare collections!

1140
01:05:02,751 --> 01:05:04,126
You've become a good business woman!

1141
01:05:05,043 --> 01:05:06,751
I'll be hanging around
with you for two days.

1142
01:05:07,251 --> 01:05:08,960
I want to observe
the fashions trends of Ernakulam.

1143
01:05:09,626 --> 01:05:12,126
After dropping me at the airport
and till my return,

1144
01:05:12,126 --> 01:05:13,501
<i>that's for 10 days.</i>

1145
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,418
My car is all yours!

1146
01:05:15,418 --> 01:05:17,001
Go around anywhere like a free bird.

1147
01:05:18,793 --> 01:05:20,210
Stop..stop.

1148
01:05:23,668 --> 01:05:25,001
Give me the cover.

1149
01:05:26,168 --> 01:05:27,210
Hello! Happy couple!

1150
01:05:27,626 --> 01:05:29,751
When did you arrive?

1151
01:05:29,918 --> 01:05:30,835
Just entered.

1152
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:33,126
"Around the world" ride and back?

1153
01:05:33,293 --> 01:05:34,376
A small shopping!

1154
01:05:34,793 --> 01:05:37,876
We had a ghee roast and
a coffee from Kamath's shop.

1155
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,251
Tomorrow is her birthday.

1156
01:05:40,251 --> 01:05:41,001
She said!

1157
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:46,251
Deepa is fortunate to have such
a happy couple as her neighbour!

1158
01:05:47,251 --> 01:05:50,210
Her life is caught between the
estranged couple in the Family court.

1159
01:05:50,918 --> 01:05:52,751
When I see their love, I too think..

1160
01:05:53,501 --> 01:05:55,668
Have you ever thought
of the reason behind it?

1161
01:05:55,668 --> 01:05:59,001
Tell me! It'll be interesting to hear!

1162
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:02,293
You both are living together
ever since your retirement, right?

1163
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:03,001
That's right.

1164
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,876
During your good times, you
were a Postmaster in Kasargod

1165
01:06:06,418 --> 01:06:08,210
And Rosy aunty, was in AIR, Trivandrum.

1166
01:06:09,001 --> 01:06:11,501
When Kariachhan reaches Trivandrum,
Rosy aunty in Thrissur.

1167
01:06:12,043 --> 01:06:14,251
When Rosy aunty reaches Alappuzha,
Kariachhan in Kannur.

1168
01:06:14,668 --> 01:06:16,001
Then, where's the
possibility of a fight?

1169
01:06:16,001 --> 01:06:18,001
This is what you call as jealousy.

1170
01:06:18,293 --> 01:06:19,501
Would you be here for few days?

1171
01:06:19,668 --> 01:06:20,626
For 2-3 days!

1172
01:06:20,793 --> 01:06:23,210
I'll refresh and be back. Come dear!

1173
01:06:24,918 --> 01:06:27,876
Not you, little one!
I called Rosymol!

1174
01:06:28,043 --> 01:06:29,876
She always goes behind to
become a laughing stock

1175
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:34,126
What's special for
your birthday tomorrow?

1176
01:06:34,418 --> 01:06:36,126
Beef coconut roast!

1177
01:06:36,876 --> 01:06:38,626
Get lost! No Beef on birthday!

1178
01:06:39,043 --> 01:06:42,668
Mom usually makes
sweet kheer on birthday.

1179
01:06:42,668 --> 01:06:44,001
I don't like Sweet kheer!

1180
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:46,126
Only if she taste it and see,
she'll like it.

1181
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:46,960
She doesn't even touches it.

1182
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:49,376
And finally it goes into
the mouth of neighbours.

1183
01:06:49,793 --> 01:06:51,751
Why do you make it
if she doesn't like?

1184
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:53,710
Sweet kheer canceled!

1185
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:55,751
We shall make delicious beef fry!

1186
01:06:56,001 --> 01:06:56,710
Thank you, aunty!

1187
01:06:59,126 --> 01:07:01,751
Will you be designing the materials
purchased from Rajasthan?

1188
01:07:02,168 --> 01:07:03,210
I'll be designing a few.

1189
01:07:03,543 --> 01:07:04,626
And rest are ready mades!

1190
01:07:05,293 --> 01:07:07,876
With high stitching charges,
running a boutique will fetch no profits

1191
01:07:08,251 --> 01:07:09,460
As you know, it's Palakad,

1192
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:13,001
Unlike Kochi and Kozhikode
very few people here buy costly clothes!

1193
01:07:14,293 --> 01:07:17,835
Few days ago, I met our
College mate Vijaya Bhaskar,

1194
01:07:18,126 --> 01:07:19,001
in the airport!

1195
01:07:20,001 --> 01:07:21,126
Vijayan in Economics!

1196
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:22,460
Fatso Vijayan!

1197
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:26,126
He didn't know that you
moved from Palakkad.

1198
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,626
Seems you never responded,
to his request in Facebook!

1199
01:07:30,168 --> 01:07:32,126
I never check my Facebook these days.

1200
01:07:35,043 --> 01:07:37,501
Mia, wash your hands and go to bed.

1201
01:07:37,793 --> 01:07:39,626
I'll be sleeping with
Farah aunty today.

1202
01:07:39,793 --> 01:07:42,210
Okay...Go and wash your hands first.

1203
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:01,251
She slept.

1204
01:08:02,126 --> 01:08:03,876
Good she finished her homework early.

1205
01:08:04,043 --> 01:08:05,376
She hardly studied anything today.

1206
01:08:05,668 --> 01:08:06,626
That much is enough!

1207
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:08,251
Don't make it "over"

1208
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,126
Be happy!

1209
01:08:11,168 --> 01:08:12,335
You're really lucky!

1210
01:08:12,793 --> 01:08:17,751
You happily hang around as
your children live with your parents.

1211
01:08:18,126 --> 01:08:19,876
If they're with you,
hen these are not possible.

1212
01:08:20,168 --> 01:08:21,876
Kids need only my parents.

1213
01:08:22,043 --> 01:08:24,043
Even if I take them to my flat,

1214
01:08:24,043 --> 01:08:25,960
they don't stay with us
for more than two days.

1215
01:08:26,543 --> 01:08:27,960
Is Rafeeq happy?

1216
01:08:29,293 --> 01:08:31,335
There's nothing short
for his happiness!

1217
01:08:32,293 --> 01:08:33,876
He's more happy now.

1218
01:08:34,418 --> 01:08:35,501
Why?

1219
01:08:35,876 --> 01:08:38,501
He has got a new friend.

1220
01:08:39,043 --> 01:08:40,085
Girlfriend?

1221
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:47,460
These are acceptable in our community

1222
01:08:48,126 --> 01:08:49,001
Still..

1223
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,960
It would've been much better
if I'd not known it.

1224
01:08:52,543 --> 01:08:53,710
I happened to know.

1225
01:08:54,376 --> 01:08:57,501
When I see him shamelessly
pretending love,

1226
01:08:58,043 --> 01:08:59,251
I really hate it.

1227
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,335
Does Rafeeq know that
you're aware of it?

1228
01:09:02,376 --> 01:09:04,001
I never showed that I know.

1229
01:09:04,293 --> 01:09:05,626
But I've decided one thing.

1230
01:09:06,001 --> 01:09:08,335
I'm not ready to share
my life with him.

1231
01:09:09,793 --> 01:09:12,960
We sleep in a single room...
with <i>2</i> hearts..

1232
01:09:14,043 --> 01:09:15,251
At the two edges of the Cot.

1233
01:09:16,918 --> 01:09:20,001
As I've engaged myself in
boutique and business trips,

1234
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:21,251
I don't feel disheartened!

1235
01:09:25,376 --> 01:09:27,085
Nothing remains the same forever!

1236
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:28,960
Everything keeps on changing.

1237
01:09:29,293 --> 01:09:31,626
Love, bondage, everything..

1238
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,251
Like how the visuals changes
during a journey!

1239
01:09:34,668 --> 01:09:36,335
We will not be able to stop anything.

1240
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:40,126
Just believe you're happy.

1241
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,001
And if you believe it for long..

1242
01:09:42,293 --> 01:09:44,210
Ultimately, you'll really feel happy!

1243
01:09:47,126 --> 01:09:49,876
You sleep! We must make
Beef fry tomorrow,

1244
01:09:50,043 --> 01:09:51,876
adding coconut flakes! Good night!

1245
01:10:04,126 --> 01:10:05,501
There are no activities
in this profile.

1246
01:10:05,793 --> 01:10:07,251
Her last post was two months back.

1247
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:10,001
So 1st guess, she's a busy lady.

1248
01:10:11,043 --> 01:10:12,376
It's not that easy to impress her.

1249
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,126
I uttered some "dialogues" to Kalyani!

1250
01:10:15,376 --> 01:10:16,960
If this doesn't work,
then I'll be in complete trouble.

1251
01:10:17,918 --> 01:10:20,126
You didn't go to office today,
fearing Kalyani?

1252
01:10:20,418 --> 01:10:21,710
Fear! For me?

1253
01:10:22,043 --> 01:10:23,710
Haven't I taken up a task?

1254
01:10:24,501 --> 01:10:27,001
Still, you don't have the
capability to handle women!

1255
01:10:27,751 --> 01:10:30,460
Don't talk, don't shout..

1256
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:34,501
Why get disappointed that
your first attempt failed?

1257
01:10:35,043 --> 01:10:37,751
If a woman says NO right on your face,

1258
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:38,876
that doesn't mean NO.

1259
01:10:39,126 --> 01:10:40,501
Is it? Then?

1260
01:10:40,918 --> 01:10:42,001
We must compel her.

1261
01:10:42,668 --> 01:10:43,960
If necessary, go after her.

1262
01:10:44,668 --> 01:10:47,293
If she feeIs she's that important..

1263
01:10:47,293 --> 01:10:48,376
Then, everything will turns to YES!

1264
01:10:48,793 --> 01:10:49,960
Really?

1265
01:10:50,168 --> 01:10:52,210
Work out in that angle and say!

1266
01:10:59,918 --> 01:11:01,376
You were coming back after
watching a cinema!

1267
01:11:01,668 --> 01:11:02,626
You'd gone for which show?

1268
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:03,251
Matinee!

1269
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:04,960
No , Second show.

1270
01:11:05,168 --> 01:11:06,710
No advocate, it's matinee.

1271
01:11:07,043 --> 01:11:09,168
Yes, right. But you must tell the court,

1272
01:11:09,168 --> 01:11:10,710
that when you were back
from the second show,

1273
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:13,085
there were no lights on the way.

1274
01:11:17,793 --> 01:11:19,001
Hearing will be held
only in the afternoon.

1275
01:11:19,001 --> 01:11:20,501
So teach him correctly.

1276
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:22,001
You can leave to the Court!

1277
01:11:22,543 --> 01:11:23,835
Okay then, I'll take care.

1278
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:30,210
Regarding the villa case of
an NRI nurse who worked in Germany.

1279
01:11:30,501 --> 01:11:31,751
We failed to file this case.

1280
01:11:32,001 --> 01:11:33,001
Client is here.

1281
01:11:34,251 --> 01:11:36,210
It wasn't missed out.
Let it be here itself.

1282
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,210
Send them away with some excuse!

1283
01:11:38,668 --> 01:11:40,751
Sir, I feel it's a genuine case.

1284
01:11:41,168 --> 01:11:43,876
She toiled hard in Germany for 36 yrs
and saved these earnings.

1285
01:11:45,376 --> 01:11:47,501
Ask them to meet me after 10 days.

1286
01:11:48,251 --> 01:11:50,210
They've already been up
and down many times!

1287
01:11:50,543 --> 01:11:52,501
They don't have enough
money to win a case,

1288
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:55,335
against a big group like GM Builders!

1289
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:57,001
It's not the money alone that matters!

1290
01:11:57,376 --> 01:11:58,918
When it doesn't benefit us,

1291
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:00,501
Why needlessly carry
the bitterness of Bigwigs?

1292
01:12:01,668 --> 01:12:03,335
Let 1000 guilty men go free,

1293
01:12:03,626 --> 01:12:05,210
but not a single
innocent man to be punished.

1294
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:07,626
Ethics of an advocate
is only that much.

1295
01:12:08,168 --> 01:12:09,460
If we don't stand beside criminals,

1296
01:12:09,876 --> 01:12:11,001
we'll hardly have any case and money.

1297
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:14,001
Why don't you tell them that you're
not willing to take up the case?

1298
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:18,376
Ask anyone, everybody will
have some sad story to say.

1299
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:21,210
If you show mercy towards
each and every sad story,

1300
01:12:21,418 --> 01:12:23,376
then, you can't become a
successful Advocate.

1301
01:12:23,793 --> 01:12:25,126
It's not a social service.

1302
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:29,376
Good morning, sir.
- Please come in.

1303
01:12:29,668 --> 01:12:30,710
You may go, Deepa!

1304
01:12:31,793 --> 01:12:32,710
Sit.

1305
01:12:35,501 --> 01:12:37,626
Lawyer is not going
to take up your case.

1306
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:40,376
Find another efficient lawyer quickly.

1307
01:12:41,168 --> 01:12:42,960
Defendant is very influential people!

1308
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:44,126
They will play with money.

1309
01:12:44,668 --> 01:12:46,585
If the lawyer is not efficient,
then it's hard to win.

1310
01:12:47,793 --> 01:12:49,876
We met Advocate Sridharan Nair .

1311
01:12:50,293 --> 01:12:51,585
He asked us to meet him.

1312
01:12:52,043 --> 01:12:53,001
Whom shall I approach now?

1313
01:12:53,626 --> 01:12:55,710
Prominent lawyers will
not take up this case.

1314
01:12:56,626 --> 01:12:58,251
I've no one to suggest also.

1315
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:00,251
Will you take up this case?

1316
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:01,501
Me?

1317
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:03,376
It'll be of no use!

1318
01:13:04,043 --> 01:13:06,876
We won't mind if we lose the case also.

1319
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:08,626
- Please..
- Please

1320
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:14,751
I'll be in the Family court!
We'll discuss there.

1321
01:13:55,251 --> 01:14:00,876
"O Krishna, with dearest Radha"

1322
01:14:43,043 --> 01:14:48,001
"O Krishna, with dearest Radha"

1323
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,376
Do you still practice?

1324
01:14:51,543 --> 01:14:53,126
Only during the days I wake up early.

1325
01:14:53,376 --> 01:14:54,376
So as to keep in touch..

1326
01:14:54,668 --> 01:14:56,210
It'll not be possible if Mia wakes up.

1327
01:14:57,043 --> 01:14:58,626
Tomorrow morning is your flight, right?

1328
01:14:59,168 --> 01:15:01,001
So, we'll have only
today to hang around!

1329
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:02,585
When shall we go to LULU?

1330
01:15:02,918 --> 01:15:04,835
I'm always free...it's you who's busy!

1331
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,626
Today, after 11.30, I'll be free.

1332
01:15:08,168 --> 01:15:10,876
Not only Lulu, we shall go
around all the malls in Ernakulam.

1333
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:14,001
Milk has not come!

1334
01:15:14,168 --> 01:15:16,210
- We'll make black tea?
- Okay.

1335
01:15:27,126 --> 01:15:28,501
I didn't tell you one thing.

1336
01:15:29,751 --> 01:15:31,126
I actually thought of not telling you.

1337
01:15:32,168 --> 01:15:33,085
What's it?

1338
01:15:33,668 --> 01:15:34,876
It's about your Ex-husband!

1339
01:15:36,376 --> 01:15:37,585
Rajeev got married again!

1340
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:44,626
She is my friend's cousin! Dr. Usha!

1341
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:46,751
She was also a divorcee.

1342
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:48,918
Good.

1343
01:15:48,918 --> 01:15:51,376
Hope he'll not take a
tough stand in Mia's case

1344
01:15:51,918 --> 01:15:53,626
Otherwise, once she crosses 12 yrs,,

1345
01:15:53,626 --> 01:15:55,210
won't he have the rights to claim her?

1346
01:15:55,668 --> 01:15:57,376
You can't trust Rajeev!

1347
01:15:58,376 --> 01:15:59,835
He doesn't have any affection.

1348
01:16:00,376 --> 01:16:01,751
Really cruel!

1349
01:16:02,793 --> 01:16:04,460
It's not because of his
love for the kid...

1350
01:16:05,293 --> 01:16:07,501
But because he doesn't
want me to live in peace!

1351
01:16:08,418 --> 01:16:09,876
Although he married again,

1352
01:16:10,043 --> 01:16:11,376
If he gets a chance,
he'll surely avenge me.

1353
01:16:11,918 --> 01:16:12,710
I'm damn sure.

1354
01:16:13,043 --> 01:16:14,710
Needlessly, don't get tensed now.

1355
01:16:15,543 --> 01:16:18,210
Not now. I always have that tension.

1356
01:16:19,251 --> 01:16:22,585
Even in the Court,
I couldn't prove his cruelty.

1357
01:16:24,043 --> 01:16:28,251
My mom still believes that
I was the main cause of divorce.

1358
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:33,126
That's why she lives with
my brother in America.

1359
01:16:35,043 --> 01:16:36,585
He parted everybody from me.

1360
01:16:37,501 --> 01:16:39,085
Now I only have Mia with me.

1361
01:16:39,626 --> 01:16:41,876
For this reason only,
I hesitated to tell this to you.

1362
01:16:42,876 --> 01:16:44,210
Doesn't matter, Farah!

1363
01:16:44,876 --> 01:16:46,126
I'll raise my child,

1364
01:16:46,793 --> 01:16:50,126
I'll raise her providing good education,
courage and attitude.

1365
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:53,501
It's the Milk!

1366
01:17:00,418 --> 01:17:02,126
All the three films which
are running here are best.

1367
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:03,626
The choice is yours!

1368
01:17:03,876 --> 01:17:05,418
English, Tamil, Hindi

1369
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:07,251
Not Hindi! I won't understand
a bit of Hindi.

1370
01:17:07,543 --> 01:17:09,126
I've given up learning
Hindi when I was in grade 10.

1371
01:17:09,543 --> 01:17:11,251
Watch Hindi serials regularly!

1372
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:12,126
Then, it will be easy.

1373
01:17:12,793 --> 01:17:15,501
Here's a new born advising
a man well-experienced in life!

1374
01:17:15,793 --> 01:17:17,460
English is enough.
Let's watch if you need.

1375
01:17:17,668 --> 01:17:18,710
Have you seen Godfather?

1376
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:19,793
Who's that?

1377
01:17:19,793 --> 01:17:20,501
Your dad!

1378
01:17:27,918 --> 01:17:28,626
What happened, bro?

1379
01:17:29,043 --> 01:17:31,210
Advocate Deepa is there.
She's the one.

1380
01:17:31,501 --> 01:17:32,501
Oh! Is she the one?

1381
01:17:36,376 --> 01:17:38,876
Bro, this is the golden chance!

1382
01:17:39,668 --> 01:17:41,710
Try and talk to her informally.

1383
01:17:42,043 --> 01:17:44,001
Follow her casually,

1384
01:17:44,251 --> 01:17:46,085
and bump at her at right time!

1385
01:17:54,876 --> 01:17:55,876
Wonderful idea!

1386
01:18:49,668 --> 01:18:50,251
Hello Advocate!

1387
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:52,001
How dare you touch?

1388
01:18:52,168 --> 01:18:53,543
Since a long time I've been..

1389
01:18:53,543 --> 01:18:54,585
I want to talk to her.

1390
01:18:55,376 --> 01:18:56,001
You ogler!

1391
01:18:56,168 --> 01:18:57,251
Always pulling up the pant!

1392
01:18:57,543 --> 01:18:58,626
I forgot to put on my belt.

1393
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,001
What's the commotion here?

1394
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:02,585
He's after us for a long time.

1395
01:19:04,168 --> 01:19:05,460
Please wait..

1396
01:19:05,668 --> 01:19:07,835
I actually wanted to talk
to her about Interview.

1397
01:19:08,918 --> 01:19:10,001
I'm Vanithrathnam..

1398
01:19:13,293 --> 01:19:15,751
It's really a wonderful ideal!
You bloody!

1399
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:16,751
Move.

1400
01:19:29,793 --> 01:19:32,126
Bro, what's the time?

1401
01:19:36,376 --> 01:19:38,001
Read this.

1402
01:19:45,918 --> 01:19:48,751
Eve teaser caught in the net!

1403
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:50,251
Who's Eve-teaser?

1404
01:19:51,168 --> 01:19:52,835
Believing the words of
those liar women,

1405
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:56,835
Who gave you the license to
derogate decent people like us?

1406
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:59,001
Eveteaser caught in the net!
Which Eve-teaser?

1407
01:19:59,918 --> 01:20:01,210
This will not end here.

1408
01:20:01,793 --> 01:20:03,210
I'll make you people
accountable for this.

1409
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:06,710
I don't mind going
even to the Supreme Court.

1410
01:20:07,418 --> 01:20:09,126
Is there nobody concerned about men?

1411
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:11,251
Don't we've any worth for our honour?

1412
01:20:11,543 --> 01:20:12,126
I will teach them a lesson

1413
01:20:12,293 --> 01:20:16,293
I swear on the Lord. I'll surely take
those people who humiliated me to task.

1414
01:20:16,293 --> 01:20:17,251
Will you shut up?

1415
01:20:19,418 --> 01:20:23,251
Oh...l see!

1416
01:20:48,251 --> 01:20:50,335
What should I bring from Rajasthan?

1417
01:20:50,585 --> 01:20:54,251
A Camel!...A Camel!

1418
01:20:54,626 --> 01:20:55,585
Naughty girl!

1419
01:20:57,126 --> 01:20:58,126
Like mother, Like daughter!

1420
01:20:58,126 --> 01:21:00,126
She needs a Camel from Rajasthan!

1421
01:21:00,793 --> 01:21:01,835
Sign this!

1422
01:21:02,293 --> 01:21:03,418
What is this?

1423
01:21:06,418 --> 01:21:08,835
Why this sentiment towards him?

1424
01:21:09,626 --> 01:21:11,376
Isn't it enough if I sign
this apology after I return?

1425
01:21:11,376 --> 01:21:12,918
Let him struggle with Police and case.

1426
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:15,501
Poor fellow! He's the
reporter of Vanitharathnam!

1427
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:19,460
Seems I've become a celebrity - a brave
woman after I fell into the pothole.

1428
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,918
He's after me for an interview with me.

1429
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,001
Oh I see! So, he was after you!

1430
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:28,001
When you created a ruckus
that he was after you,

1431
01:21:28,335 --> 01:21:31,751
I kept quiet as I didn't want
to hurt your ego in public!

1432
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:35,960
Smart fellow!
He'll definitely get your interview!

1433
01:21:38,043 --> 01:21:38,918
It'll never happen!

1434
01:21:39,501 --> 01:21:40,626
You carry on.

1435
01:21:40,626 --> 01:21:41,460
We shouldn't be late...

1436
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,710
as her speech in the school is
the 1st item in the Competition!

1437
01:21:44,501 --> 01:21:46,751
Best of luck to get
1st prize in all items!

1438
01:21:47,751 --> 01:21:49,126
Thank you! Bye, aunty!

1439
01:21:57,376 --> 01:21:59,126
Say the speech once!

1440
01:21:59,793 --> 01:22:01,668
Our house and its surroundings,

1441
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,251
Our body and mind..

1442
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:07,335
Should always be kept clean,

1443
01:22:07,668 --> 01:22:12,835
is Bapuji's...

1444
01:22:13,168 --> 01:22:14,793
...birthday message.

1445
01:22:14,793 --> 01:22:16,626
Can't I say that in English?

1446
01:22:17,043 --> 01:22:18,335
Then, you'll not come 1st!

1447
01:22:18,668 --> 01:22:20,335
No English words in Malayalam speech!

1448
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:21,960
2nd is enough!

1449
01:22:31,043 --> 01:22:33,293
Car is better than Scooter,
isn't it, mom?

1450
01:22:33,543 --> 01:22:35,168
There's no dust or smoke!

1451
01:22:41,376 --> 01:22:42,626
So cool!

1452
01:23:00,501 --> 01:23:01,876
We shall also buy a car, OK?

1453
01:23:02,126 --> 01:23:02,835
When?

1454
01:23:03,293 --> 01:23:05,418
We'll see! We shall buy it immediately.

1455
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:08,043
Were you waiting for a long time?

1456
01:23:08,043 --> 01:23:09,293
No, just 5 minutes.

1457
01:23:09,293 --> 01:23:11,918
Go to the station and
hand this over to S.l directly

1458
01:23:12,168 --> 01:23:13,085
That man must be released today itself.

1459
01:23:13,335 --> 01:23:15,168
Call me if there are any other issues.

1460
01:23:15,168 --> 01:23:16,418
You're not coming to the Court today?

1461
01:23:16,626 --> 01:23:17,876
Her programmes are there in
school today.

1462
01:23:17,876 --> 01:23:19,876
- I'll be spending full time with her.
- All the best, Mia!

1463
01:23:19,876 --> 01:23:20,918
Thank you, Tara!!

1464
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:23,126
Calling her Tara?
Is she your little sister?

1465
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,793
Bye.
- Bye.

1466
01:23:28,876 --> 01:23:29,918
Have you come out so early?

1467
01:23:33,001 --> 01:23:35,085
S.l told me, unless and until that lady
withdraws her complaint,

1468
01:23:35,085 --> 01:23:36,335
you'll not be released.

1469
01:23:36,585 --> 01:23:37,418
Then, how did you come out?

1470
01:23:37,793 --> 01:23:38,751
Who let you out?

1471
01:23:39,293 --> 01:23:42,835
I've gone behind many girls.

1472
01:23:43,126 --> 01:23:45,085
Has any girl complained against me?

1473
01:23:45,668 --> 01:23:46,793
It's an Art! Bro!

1474
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:49,460
Doesn't matter! First time, right?

1475
01:23:53,293 --> 01:23:56,460
Get me a black coffee with more sugar!

1476
01:24:13,043 --> 01:24:14,418
Have all your problems been solved?

1477
01:24:15,168 --> 01:24:17,126
If it's not a case of women harassment
then it's simple.

1478
01:24:18,168 --> 01:24:20,710
See how cool he walks!

1479
01:24:20,918 --> 01:24:22,835
Hey Vineeth! What happened to you?

1480
01:24:23,126 --> 01:24:25,251
Normally, you don't lose your control!

1481
01:24:25,543 --> 01:24:26,585
She must be a good figure.

1482
01:24:27,126 --> 01:24:28,835
Otherwise you wouldn't have
lost your control.

1483
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:31,626
On seeing their dressing
and their chest-lifted walk...

1484
01:24:31,626 --> 01:24:33,168
even the Lord will lose His control!

1485
01:24:39,585 --> 01:24:40,793
Good morning.

1486
01:24:40,793 --> 01:24:42,085
You've become a great celebrity!

1487
01:24:43,126 --> 01:24:45,168
Shall we celebrate then?

1488
01:24:45,585 --> 01:24:46,335
Are you free this evening?

1489
01:24:46,835 --> 01:24:47,710
I'm ready.

1490
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:50,835
Okay, I'll send it sir.

1491
01:24:55,585 --> 01:24:57,876
I'll never blame Vineeth N Pillai!

1492
01:25:01,543 --> 01:25:04,001
At this age as a bachelor“.

1493
01:25:04,001 --> 01:25:06,418
...it'll be a wonder only
if you don't have such feelings!

1494
01:25:07,168 --> 01:25:08,418
I told everybody here...

1495
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,251
Isn't Pillai also a man?

1496
01:25:10,501 --> 01:25:12,418
How long could he control his desires?

1497
01:25:12,876 --> 01:25:15,376
Nobody likes to see a man being happy!

1498
01:25:16,001 --> 01:25:17,293
Will you leave?

1499
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:20,043
Get out!

1500
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:23,710
I thought of supporting him
but he never lets me do that also.

1501
01:25:28,918 --> 01:25:30,001
Yes!

1502
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,668
Coming.

1503
01:25:33,793 --> 01:25:37,501
You usually insult and
talk ill of women!

1504
01:25:37,876 --> 01:25:38,543
I know that.

1505
01:25:39,001 --> 01:25:40,335
In a public place...

1506
01:25:40,585 --> 01:25:42,043
that too a Vanitharathnam staff..

1507
01:25:42,251 --> 01:25:42,793
Shucks!

1508
01:25:42,793 --> 01:25:43,751
It's not as you said...

1509
01:25:43,751 --> 01:25:45,543
I don't need any justifications.

1510
01:25:46,418 --> 01:25:48,251
She withdrew her complaint
as she was decent!

1511
01:25:48,585 --> 01:25:49,376
Otherwise.

1512
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,751
That lady Farah is
Deepa's intimate friend.

1513
01:25:53,168 --> 01:25:54,168
l enquired..

1514
01:25:54,501 --> 01:25:57,168
Hereafter, however hard
you try, will she give an interview?

1515
01:25:57,501 --> 01:25:58,376
You're hopeless!

1516
01:25:58,376 --> 01:25:59,335
Just a minute.

1517
01:26:11,085 --> 01:26:12,710
As I'm being paid a salary,

1518
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:15,335
I'm silently listening
to all your criticisms!

1519
01:26:15,793 --> 01:26:16,626
Hereafter I don't have to.

1520
01:26:16,876 --> 01:26:18,293
It's my resignation letter!
I resign!

1521
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:19,501
That's what you also want.

1522
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,626
You don't want me to complete
that assigned task.

1523
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:23,835
You want me to lose.

1524
01:26:24,043 --> 01:26:25,668
And sack me away for that reason.

1525
01:26:26,043 --> 01:26:27,001
You don't have to
take that trouble anymore.

1526
01:26:27,001 --> 01:26:28,168
Listen..
- Hey!

1527
01:26:28,168 --> 01:26:30,210
Henceforth, I'm not your staff, mind it.

1528
01:26:35,918 --> 01:26:39,835
An Advocate's duty is to argue
and win the case,

1529
01:26:40,085 --> 01:26:41,043
and not counselling.

1530
01:26:41,876 --> 01:26:44,835
But, to the clients who come to me,

1531
01:26:44,835 --> 01:26:46,293
I try to tell them the facts
with my life's experiences.

1532
01:26:46,918 --> 01:26:48,835
At least few of them
like you will understand.

1533
01:26:50,126 --> 01:26:52,668
Rather than separating the couple,

1534
01:26:52,668 --> 01:26:55,251
I feel more happy in settling
their differences and uniting them!

1535
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,043
You saw this?

1536
01:26:59,376 --> 01:27:00,876
These are the tears of affection!

1537
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:04,918
Go for an outing with your children.

1538
01:27:06,126 --> 01:27:07,210
Thank you, ma'am!

1539
01:27:15,126 --> 01:27:17,751
If they fight again, I don't
think they'll come back to you.

1540
01:27:18,001 --> 01:27:19,710
They might approach some other lawyer.

1541
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,918
They have no such big issues
between them.

1542
01:27:22,335 --> 01:27:24,585
Those who feel they can never unite,

1543
01:27:24,585 --> 01:27:25,876
Then divorce is the better option.

1544
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:27,585
And I'm not against that too

1545
01:27:27,585 --> 01:27:29,626
Mia, enough of your drawing. Come.

1546
01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:32,626
No more clients, right?

1547
01:27:32,626 --> 01:27:34,710
Clients of the villa case
are waiting outside.

1548
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,335
I've dispatched the lawyer
notice to GM Builders.

1549
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:43,876
If they wish to evade from
the case and settle it out of Court,

1550
01:27:43,876 --> 01:27:45,001
Don't you think that'll be better?

1551
01:27:45,001 --> 01:27:46,710
We just want our money back.

1552
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:48,043
We neither need any
profit nor interest!

1553
01:27:48,251 --> 01:27:49,501
We'll wait and see.

1554
01:27:49,793 --> 01:27:52,626
You said,
there are two other complainants!

1555
01:27:52,835 --> 01:27:54,251
Ask them also to move this.

1556
01:27:54,251 --> 01:27:55,668
They're all very affluent people!

1557
01:27:55,668 --> 01:27:57,751
Only for investment purpose,
they bought that villa.

1558
01:27:57,751 --> 01:27:59,835
Yes! But loss is a loss, right?

1559
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:02,126
Try your maximum to
involve them in this case.

1560
01:28:02,501 --> 01:28:03,960
It'll make our case strong.

1561
01:28:04,668 --> 01:28:05,418
See you

1562
01:28:15,251 --> 01:28:17,960
You gave the resignation letter
impulsively, right?

1563
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,543
Will they take that so seriously?

1564
01:28:19,543 --> 01:28:21,918
Yes! Kalyani also longs for that.

1565
01:28:22,168 --> 01:28:24,085
Srikumari Amma has no voice!

1566
01:28:24,418 --> 01:28:25,918
He voluntarily resigned !

1567
01:28:26,126 --> 01:28:27,501
Besides a bad name also.

1568
01:28:28,751 --> 01:28:31,626
Deepa, who was the 2nd
witness in that case,

1569
01:28:31,626 --> 01:28:34,126
withdrew the complaint against you.

1570
01:28:34,126 --> 01:28:35,585
That too without anybody
influencing her!

1571
01:28:36,085 --> 01:28:37,251
That means..

1572
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:39,835
There's something there.

1573
01:28:40,501 --> 01:28:41,501
What something there?

1574
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:43,918
Something which is unknown to everyone.

1575
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:45,126
Doesn't she know the truth?

1576
01:28:45,418 --> 01:28:46,918
That lady Farah is the liar, isn't she?

1577
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:50,418
She must have told her
that I didn't touch her.

1578
01:28:50,668 --> 01:28:51,710
Advocate would've understood that,

1579
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:53,168
If I'm not let out,
it'll lead to more trouble

1580
01:28:53,418 --> 01:28:54,876
That's something there! What else?

1581
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:56,001
But why are you losing your temper?

1582
01:29:06,001 --> 01:29:07,168
Shall I buy oranges?

1583
01:29:07,793 --> 01:29:09,626
- If you eat then I'll buy
- No

1584
01:29:10,585 --> 01:29:12,210
There's no use showing
your anger on me!

1585
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:13,835
I'll not get you that chocolate!

1586
01:29:14,043 --> 01:29:15,960
That chocolate is full of dry fruits!

1587
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,918
Not like the one you imagine!

1588
01:29:18,585 --> 01:29:19,668
Get me one kg of orange!

1589
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:25,585
Rs.100!

1590
01:29:28,251 --> 01:29:28,835
Come!

1591
01:29:34,501 --> 01:29:36,126
Boss wants to meet you directly

1592
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:38,126
Boss? Which boss?

1593
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:39,710
If it's regarding the case,

1594
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:41,835
ask him to come to office
tomorrow at 10 a.m

1595
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:42,918
Boss is not free at that time.

1596
01:29:42,918 --> 01:29:44,668
He has come here to meet madam!

1597
01:29:46,001 --> 01:29:47,376
To meet me? Over here?

1598
01:29:47,376 --> 01:29:49,376
Yes! Come..Boss is waiting in the car.

1599
01:30:08,168 --> 01:30:10,543
I'm GM Builders CEO

1600
01:30:12,501 --> 01:30:14,210
Understanding the
gravity of the problem,

1601
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:15,585
I'd come to meet you personally

1602
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:17,751
You don't know me.

1603
01:30:18,126 --> 01:30:20,210
But Advocate Sethu Madhavan
Nambiar knows me well.

1604
01:30:20,918 --> 01:30:22,460
He's my friend.

1605
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:25,168
Let's quash the case!
We're also not interested!

1606
01:30:25,626 --> 01:30:26,751
Out of the Court...

1607
01:30:26,751 --> 01:30:28,251
we shall settle this paying 50 lakhs

1608
01:30:28,835 --> 01:30:32,543
DD..cheque..a/c transfer..or whatever.

1609
01:30:32,918 --> 01:30:33,960
But not cash!

1610
01:30:37,543 --> 01:30:39,335
Though I appear to be a virtuous man,

1611
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:41,626
I'm not like that!

1612
01:30:42,168 --> 01:30:45,918
The underworld, not only exist
in Hollywood and Mumbai,

1613
01:30:46,293 --> 01:30:47,335
but also in Kochi.

1614
01:30:51,543 --> 01:30:52,460
Daughter?

1615
01:30:57,668 --> 01:30:58,585
Thank you.

1616
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:05,543
See you.

1617
01:31:09,126 --> 01:31:11,251
Mom! See this!
This is full of dry fruits.

1618
01:31:11,876 --> 01:31:13,251
Dry fruit! Hell with it!

1619
01:31:24,543 --> 01:31:25,168
I was passing this way..

1620
01:31:25,835 --> 01:31:27,418
When I saw you, I just stopped here.

1621
01:31:27,418 --> 01:31:28,543
Good that I met you!

1622
01:31:28,543 --> 01:31:30,001
I too wanted to meet you.

1623
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:31,210
To say sorry, right?

1624
01:31:31,543 --> 01:31:33,251
Do you think everything
will end with this?

1625
01:31:33,251 --> 01:31:34,710
Oh no! It was not to say Sorry.

1626
01:31:35,085 --> 01:31:38,418
But to advise you not to get
too excited while talking to women!

1627
01:31:38,918 --> 01:31:40,001
Have that in mind, henceforth.

1628
01:31:40,251 --> 01:31:40,918
See you then.

1629
01:31:43,793 --> 01:31:45,085
Women are always Women!

1630
01:31:45,085 --> 01:31:46,751
Whether it's she or her!

1631
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:48,710
We just can't do anything!

1632
01:31:49,918 --> 01:31:51,710
Haven't you seen the girls in Mahe!

1633
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:54,043
Haven't you seen the girls in Chokli!

1634
01:31:54,501 --> 01:31:55,585
If you haven't seen, come.,

1635
01:31:55,876 --> 01:31:57,668
Come over here and see!

1636
01:31:58,168 --> 01:31:59,835
Will get into unnecessary mess!

1637
01:32:00,043 --> 01:32:02,543
Underworld doesn't exist
only in Hollywood and Mumbai.

1638
01:32:02,543 --> 01:32:04,418
But also in Kochi.
That was his dialogue.

1639
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:06,585
And he gave her one chocolate.

1640
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,043
I wonder if those rogues had
mixed something in that.

1641
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:11,043
No! Mom is simply saying-

1642
01:32:11,335 --> 01:32:12,335
It was a good Chocolate!

1643
01:32:12,543 --> 01:32:15,918
Get lost! That team cannot be
considered as human beings!

1644
01:32:15,918 --> 01:32:18,001
Be careful! Time is bad!

1645
01:32:18,251 --> 01:32:20,835
You live alone with a girl child!
Remember that!

1646
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,585
Nothing to get scared of!

1647
01:32:23,251 --> 01:32:26,251
In that tension, I met Vanitharathnam!

1648
01:32:26,751 --> 01:32:28,751
I don't know why,
but I felt quite relieved!

1649
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,335
As if I'd met a relative or a friend!

1650
01:32:32,835 --> 01:32:35,543
His sacred sandal mark
and an ideal name...!

1651
01:32:35,793 --> 01:32:36,543
Vineethan Pillai!

1652
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:38,626
I've seen him somewhere!

1653
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,168
He doesn't seem to be good.

1654
01:32:40,376 --> 01:32:43,251
No! Poor fellow! A soft-hearted one!

1655
01:32:43,793 --> 01:32:46,001
Oh Jesus! "Chandana Mazha"

1656
01:32:46,293 --> 01:32:48,085
I totally forgot about my TV serial!

1657
01:32:48,085 --> 01:32:49,585
This is her only problem.

1658
01:32:49,876 --> 01:32:54,001
One day, Rosy will die while watching
a TV serial!

1659
01:33:05,376 --> 01:33:06,751
-Isn't Vineeth at home?
- He is!

1660
01:33:07,126 --> 01:33:08,668
Mathan, are you also staying here?

1661
01:33:08,668 --> 01:33:10,251
For the last 2..3..

1662
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,210
4 yrs, I am here only.

1663
01:33:11,668 --> 01:33:13,918
I've not been here ever
since the death of Sister Lakshmi.

1664
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:16,043
Otherwise, I would, definitely
come till the gate.

1665
01:33:16,293 --> 01:33:19,751
Before leaving for office, to pick up
and drop her in the evening.

1666
01:33:22,835 --> 01:33:24,710
I still feel the
presence of Lakshmi here.

1667
01:33:25,293 --> 01:33:26,751
It's 8 yrs after her death!

1668
01:33:27,418 --> 01:33:28,876
Nothing has changed!

1669
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:39,418
Rock Stewart!
My favourite singer's song!

1670
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,168
You're here listening to music!

1671
01:33:54,543 --> 01:33:55,710
Had your lunch?

1672
01:33:56,626 --> 01:33:57,960
Not yet! Have to prepare!

1673
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,376
Still not prepared?

1674
01:34:00,376 --> 01:34:01,376
When are you going to prepare?

1675
01:34:01,376 --> 01:34:04,626
Mathan will prepare it fast.
Expert cook!

1676
01:34:11,876 --> 01:34:14,335
Boxer! University Champion!

1677
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,168
"Let him go to Boxing.

1678
01:34:18,376 --> 01:34:21,418
Punch on the face of the people
who are ready for it!"

1679
01:34:21,668 --> 01:34:23,460
But leave others.

1680
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,001
Lakshmi used to say!

1681
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:27,126
With this sacred sandal mark appearance,
nobody will believe this.

1682
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:29,293
In his childhood days,
when he gets angry

1683
01:34:29,543 --> 01:34:32,335
He'll blow off the eyes and nose
of those standing around!

1684
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:34,835
If the sandal is smeared, it's cool!

1685
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:37,626
Once an astrologist said,
sandal helps to cool down the temper

1686
01:34:37,626 --> 01:34:39,001
She used to smear it on his forehead!

1687
01:34:40,501 --> 01:34:42,335
Mom had bought a piece of sandalwood.

1688
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:46,418
In the morning, she'll dip it in water
and rub it against a stone...

1689
01:34:47,335 --> 01:34:49,126
And when she smears it on my forehead,
I feel very cool!

1690
01:34:51,335 --> 01:34:53,543
I could feel the affection
of mom in that coolness!

1691
01:34:55,168 --> 01:34:56,710
What I 'd smeared now,
is not pure sandal.

1692
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:57,626
Some other powder!

1693
01:34:58,585 --> 01:34:59,793
It only has its color...

1694
01:35:00,876 --> 01:35:02,001
No fragrance or coolness.

1695
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:04,251
Leave that!

1696
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:06,043
You must've guessed the purpose
of our coming, didn't you?

1697
01:35:06,835 --> 01:35:08,626
Come to office from tomorrow!

1698
01:35:09,001 --> 01:35:10,918
Vanitharathanam really needs you!

1699
01:35:11,585 --> 01:35:13,710
If it's difficult to get
Advocate Deepa's interview,

1700
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:15,501
we'll find some other project.

1701
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:16,835
We've enough time for it.

1702
01:35:17,043 --> 01:35:18,126
If there's time, I'll try to write that!

1703
01:35:19,293 --> 01:35:20,376
When we get that which is unattainable,

1704
01:35:21,293 --> 01:35:22,418
there's thrill for the journalist.

1705
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:25,043
Advocate Deepa - an interesting story!

1706
01:35:25,626 --> 01:35:26,585
I'll get it.

1707
01:35:27,043 --> 01:35:28,251
Hope so!

1708
01:35:28,876 --> 01:35:30,543
Why don't you change your style?

1709
01:35:30,793 --> 01:35:31,835
It might do wonders

1710
01:35:32,501 --> 01:35:34,960
A new look after wiping off this mark

1711
01:35:36,293 --> 01:35:38,668
I don't know whether I could advise you.

1712
01:35:39,585 --> 01:35:41,085
As your mom smeared it..

1713
01:35:41,543 --> 01:35:43,835
My mom smeared the mark in my heart.

1714
01:35:45,918 --> 01:35:47,918
Even Advocate Deepa disliked this mark.

1715
01:35:49,168 --> 01:35:51,251
I just considered it as a joke then.

1716
01:35:52,918 --> 01:35:55,418
Let me change and see. Try new tactics!

1717
01:35:58,418 --> 01:35:59,918
Still, what's the
problem with this mark?

1718
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:27,960
My favourite song!

1719
01:36:30,543 --> 01:36:31,543
Mine too!

1720
01:36:35,585 --> 01:36:36,585
We shall move!

1721
01:36:37,043 --> 01:36:38,418
Let him have his lunch!

1722
01:37:02,043 --> 01:37:03,626
Have the tomatoes' price gone up?

1723
01:37:16,126 --> 01:37:17,126
Vineeth! Sorry.

1724
01:37:17,835 --> 01:37:20,835
Vineeth N Pillai!
Vanitharathnam Staff reporter!

1725
01:37:21,126 --> 01:37:21,751
Did you see this?

1726
01:37:22,001 --> 01:37:23,418
I've not come to peep anywhere.

1727
01:37:23,668 --> 01:37:25,168
But to meet Advocate Deepa.

1728
01:37:25,168 --> 01:37:26,876
- Is she at home?
- I don't know.

1729
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:31,376
- Hello!
- Sorry!

1730
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:36,460
Okay!

1731
01:37:44,751 --> 01:37:47,001
Who's that? What do you want?

1732
01:37:49,001 --> 01:37:53,585
Vineeth! Vanitha reporter..

1733
01:37:55,876 --> 01:37:56,710
Isn't Advocate at home?

1734
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:59,460
No. She will be back after
picking up the child from school.

1735
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:00,751
You can meet her in the evening.

1736
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:03,251
So, I shall move.

1737
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,960
Haven't I learned this? I forgot!

1738
01:38:42,876 --> 01:38:43,876
Good evening!

1739
01:38:57,918 --> 01:38:58,876
Dead!

1740
01:39:01,626 --> 01:39:02,418
My dear!

1741
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:08,418
Park your car aside!

1742
01:40:08,668 --> 01:40:09,668
- Just a minute!
- I'll be back now.

1743
01:40:09,918 --> 01:40:11,210
You're not supposed to
leave the car there!

1744
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:12,043
Let it be there for some time.

1745
01:40:12,043 --> 01:40:13,710
- No, Management will..
- Hell with your management!

1746
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:14,626
You park it aside!

1747
01:40:20,335 --> 01:40:21,418
Let me scan the child.

1748
01:40:30,251 --> 01:40:31,918
- What happened?
- No, I'm okay...okay.

1749
01:40:45,501 --> 01:40:46,418
Oh my Jesus!

1750
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:49,710
What happened?

1751
01:40:50,126 --> 01:40:51,918
I got diverted while driving.

1752
01:40:51,918 --> 01:40:54,835
Oh my Jesus! She's OK!
- Thank heavens!

1753
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:57,585
- Nothing happened to you, right?
- Yes slightly..

1754
01:40:57,585 --> 01:40:58,793
Blood is oozing!

1755
01:40:59,293 --> 01:41:00,960
That's OK! Only the skin has peeled off.

1756
01:41:01,251 --> 01:41:03,251
Still, let's dress up the wound
after consulting the doctor.

1757
01:41:03,751 --> 01:41:04,668
It's okay

1758
01:41:04,668 --> 01:41:06,335
Listen to me.

1759
01:41:06,335 --> 01:41:07,876
Rosy is near the child.

1760
01:41:07,876 --> 01:41:09,751
Come..move..

1761
01:41:12,126 --> 01:41:14,335
He dropped us in the hospital

1762
01:41:15,251 --> 01:41:17,960
How did he reach there
at the correct time to rescue you?

1763
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:21,751
Always doubting everything is
also the symptom of a disease

1764
01:41:21,751 --> 01:41:23,085
Show him also to the Doctor.

1765
01:41:24,043 --> 01:41:27,918
No sandal mark on his forehead today!
He's a troublemaker! - You come!

1766
01:41:29,585 --> 01:41:32,418
This is the best chance
for you to become a Hero!

1767
01:41:33,501 --> 01:41:35,168
God has given a wonderful opportunity
through this accident.

1768
01:41:35,168 --> 01:41:36,001
Don't miss it.

1769
01:41:36,001 --> 01:41:38,001
Try to impress her in this gap.

1770
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,543
I'll advise you what you should do next!

1771
01:41:40,543 --> 01:41:43,210
- If I follow your idea.
- You'll get into a mess, right?

1772
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:44,918
Still, I've not planned that way.

1773
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:46,960
We're going to fruits stall tomorrow.

1774
01:41:47,293 --> 01:41:49,460
We shall buy <i>2</i> kgs of orange,
2 kgs of grapes,

1775
01:41:49,835 --> 01:41:52,293
<i>2</i> kgs of pomegranate and
also 2 kgs of Dates!

1776
01:41:52,293 --> 01:41:53,001
Tasty ones!

1777
01:41:53,251 --> 01:41:56,251
After buying all these,
both of us will be going to hospital.

1778
01:41:56,251 --> 01:41:58,168
Not both of us, but only me..

1779
01:41:59,001 --> 01:42:01,210
If so, then pack each kilo separately.

1780
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:03,460
As she's a kid, why needlessly 2 kgs?

1781
01:42:03,876 --> 01:42:05,251
I'll go and have them in the studio.

1782
01:42:08,043 --> 01:42:09,585
If you get her interview,
then I'll take the photo.

1783
01:42:10,001 --> 01:42:11,043
I'll have to think about it.

1784
01:42:12,876 --> 01:42:15,835
At good times, don't forget those
who helped during your bad times.

1785
01:42:16,168 --> 01:42:17,668
When you are with me, it's a bad time..

1786
01:42:17,918 --> 01:42:18,835
When you go away, it's a good time.

1787
01:42:19,085 --> 01:42:22,168
Your hurting dialogues are
delivered easily like a pudding!

1788
01:42:22,168 --> 01:42:22,835
Get me the rice pudding.

1789
01:42:24,626 --> 01:42:25,460
Put it here.

1790
01:42:33,626 --> 01:42:35,835
- You're going straight to Palakkad, right?
- Yes

1791
01:42:36,376 --> 01:42:38,835
You finished your work
earlier than you expected, didn't you?

1792
01:42:38,835 --> 01:42:40,376
Then, you can leave after two days!

1793
01:42:40,376 --> 01:42:42,376
Until her bandage is removed,
I will also take leave.

1794
01:42:42,626 --> 01:42:45,585
I'd cut short my Rajasthan trip,

1795
01:42:45,876 --> 01:42:46,960
as my mom had called up

1796
01:42:47,501 --> 01:42:48,835
My daughter has come of age!

1797
01:42:48,835 --> 01:42:50,418
Oh She's just in grade 6

1798
01:42:51,626 --> 01:42:52,793
This is the age now

1799
01:42:52,793 --> 01:42:53,751
Times have changed.

1800
01:42:58,501 --> 01:42:59,710
Good morning.

1801
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:03,001
He helped us at the
time of the accident.

1802
01:43:03,001 --> 01:43:04,126
Vineethan Pillai!

1803
01:43:04,126 --> 01:43:05,335
Vineeth N Pillai!

1804
01:43:05,918 --> 01:43:07,918
People call me
Vineethan Pillai to tease me.

1805
01:43:08,293 --> 01:43:09,543
And I really hate it.

1806
01:43:10,043 --> 01:43:11,460
Farah is your name, right?

1807
01:43:12,210 --> 01:43:13,668
I'd seen it on your complaint!

1808
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:15,460
Farah!! A sweet name!!

1809
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:17,043
Best name!! Faarah!!

1810
01:43:22,043 --> 01:43:23,335
GET WELL SOON!

1811
01:43:23,543 --> 01:43:24,126
Thank you!

1812
01:43:26,626 --> 01:43:27,585
I've not settled the bill!

1813
01:43:27,585 --> 01:43:28,960
She will not be discharged today!

1814
01:43:29,418 --> 01:43:31,001
But doctor told me, she can go today.

1815
01:43:31,001 --> 01:43:32,085
But to me, he told this.

1816
01:43:32,293 --> 01:43:33,335
Let me check with the doctor.

1817
01:43:33,335 --> 01:43:34,501
So shall I also move?

1818
01:43:34,751 --> 01:43:36,043
- You don't require any help, right?
- No.

1819
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:37,210
If I don't leave now,

1820
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:38,335
then night drive will be difficult.

1821
01:43:39,001 --> 01:43:41,043
- Bye dear
- Bye aunty!

1822
01:43:47,126 --> 01:43:48,751
Why is this fellow
hanging around here?

1823
01:43:49,335 --> 01:43:50,751
Must be very angry with us.

1824
01:43:51,001 --> 01:43:52,210
Probably avenge us also.

1825
01:43:52,543 --> 01:43:53,793
I don't think he's that
sort of a person.

1826
01:43:54,751 --> 01:43:56,085
He doesn't seem to go.

1827
01:43:56,335 --> 01:43:57,293
He'll go.

1828
01:43:57,293 --> 01:43:59,168
He can't stay long
if Kariachhan is present.

1829
01:44:05,876 --> 01:44:07,793
So, it's quite some time
since you came!.

1830
01:44:11,335 --> 01:44:12,960
You met Deepa, didn't you?

1831
01:44:14,835 --> 01:44:16,376
Why are you still..

1832
01:44:16,376 --> 01:44:17,793
Thought of informing her and go.

1833
01:44:18,876 --> 01:44:20,376
Your motive is Interview.

1834
01:44:20,626 --> 01:44:22,918
No other hidden agenda, right?

1835
01:44:22,918 --> 01:44:24,085
What hidden agenda?

1836
01:44:24,626 --> 01:44:25,626
I'm Vanitharathnam..

1837
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:29,376
I know. You're a Staff reporter,
Vineethan Pillai.

1838
01:44:29,376 --> 01:44:30,168
Vineeth N..

1839
01:44:30,168 --> 01:44:32,001
Doctor is on the rounds.
I met the Head Nurse.

1840
01:44:32,001 --> 01:44:33,126
Nothing serious.

1841
01:44:33,126 --> 01:44:36,168
As it's head injury, they
want 24 hours of observation.

1842
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:38,460
You please go home then!

1843
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:40,126
However, she will be
discharged only tomorrow.

1844
01:44:40,126 --> 01:44:43,626
It's the technique of the
Private hospitals to fleece money.

1845
01:44:43,918 --> 01:44:45,751
Shall we move, then?

1846
01:44:46,376 --> 01:44:47,335
Shall we?

1847
01:44:47,626 --> 01:44:49,335
- I shall..
- Come later..

1848
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:03,710
Why Police...

1849
01:45:22,876 --> 01:45:23,585
Take the child.

1850
01:45:30,668 --> 01:45:31,543
Don't get scared, baby!

1851
01:45:31,793 --> 01:45:33,418
Your dad is shifting you
to a good hospital,

1852
01:45:33,626 --> 01:45:35,168
to provide you better care.

1853
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,710
Who? Where are you taking her?

1854
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:42,585
Don't take her!
Take off your hand.

1855
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,168
Don't create any ruckus!

1856
01:45:44,168 --> 01:45:46,543
Until I'm alive, I'll not let
you take away the child.

1857
01:45:47,668 --> 01:45:50,085
You can't take away the child.

1858
01:45:50,751 --> 01:45:54,001
Don't stop us..it's a legal issue!

1859
01:45:56,710 --> 01:45:58,043
Don't create any ruckus.

1860
01:45:58,043 --> 01:46:00,001
Everything is stated
clearly in the Court order!

1861
01:46:00,501 --> 01:46:02,085
Child is not safe with her mother.

1862
01:46:03,043 --> 01:46:05,043
She tried to endanger the life
of the child with her reckless driving.

1863
01:46:05,543 --> 01:46:07,668
And admitted her in a hospital
where there are no proper facilities.

1864
01:46:08,085 --> 01:46:09,460
Even the treatment is
not satisfactory!

1865
01:46:10,668 --> 01:46:12,585
Before the child turns 12,

1866
01:46:12,585 --> 01:46:13,543
if any unpleasant incident happens,

1867
01:46:14,668 --> 01:46:17,001
Don't you know the sections and
rules, Advocate Deepa!

1868
01:46:18,418 --> 01:46:22,835
Mom...Mom..come..

1869
01:46:23,626 --> 01:46:24,543
Where...?

1870
01:46:25,043 --> 01:46:26,585
You can tell the rest before the Court.

1871
01:46:28,668 --> 01:46:30,585
I came to know that
you've become famous.

1872
01:46:30,793 --> 01:46:31,543
Congrats!

1873
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:13,335
We can get back the child
only through the court.

1874
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:16,626
This Sundarajan Advocate is
a no.1 Criminal in Palakkad.

1875
01:47:17,126 --> 01:47:18,418
And also a famous Criminal lawyer.

1876
01:47:18,918 --> 01:47:21,335
He was Rajeev's lawyer
in our Divorce case!

1877
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,793
For my case, I was my own lawyer!

1878
01:47:24,126 --> 01:47:25,626
Therefore, he still holds
grudges against me.

1879
01:47:26,168 --> 01:47:28,251
Unless we plan meticulously,
we can't do anything in this.

1880
01:47:30,543 --> 01:47:31,835
You've still not left?

1881
01:47:33,376 --> 01:47:36,376
I've no idea of what happened
and what's happening around.

1882
01:47:37,168 --> 01:47:39,126
Please come. I'll drop you wherever
it may be.

1883
01:47:39,376 --> 01:47:40,626
You please go. We'll get an auto!

1884
01:47:41,751 --> 01:47:44,001
Pay me the auto fare.
I shall drop you.

1885
01:47:44,001 --> 01:47:45,043
- Please come..
- Come.

1886
01:48:17,210 --> 01:48:19,251
Dear! We've reached home.

1887
01:48:27,043 --> 01:48:30,460
Listen, I'll send Rosy home.

1888
01:48:30,918 --> 01:48:32,251
No, let Rosy aunty sleep.

1889
01:48:32,543 --> 01:48:33,793
But you're alone!

1890
01:48:34,001 --> 01:48:34,835
Doesn't matter.

1891
01:48:53,835 --> 01:49:01,293
"The moon is fading
as the night is ending"

1892
01:49:01,293 --> 01:49:08,210
"Like a solitary star, you are lonely"

1893
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:15,751
"The moon is fading
as the night is ending"

1894
01:49:16,210 --> 01:49:23,293
"Like a solitary star, you are lonely"

1895
01:49:23,585 --> 01:49:38,085
"Looking back once, the koel flew away"

1896
01:49:38,543 --> 01:49:45,626
"You went out like a lamp"

1897
01:49:45,876 --> 01:49:53,001
"The moon is fading
as the night is ending"

1898
01:49:53,376 --> 01:50:00,710
"Like a solitary star, you are lonely"

1899
01:50:23,793 --> 01:50:31,335
"In the river of darkness,“

1900
01:50:31,335 --> 01:50:37,835
"These seconds swam away sorrowfully"

1901
01:50:38,626 --> 01:50:46,168
"At last in the emptiness here
with only a memory,"

1902
01:50:46,168 --> 01:50:52,793
"You turned into a stone inscription"

1903
01:50:52,793 --> 01:51:07,460
"Your dreams went up
like the dust of pyre today"

1904
01:51:11,418 --> 01:51:18,626
"The moon is fading
as the night is ending"

1905
01:51:18,835 --> 01:51:25,710
"Like a solitary star, you are lonely"

1906
01:51:49,335 --> 01:51:56,793
"In the silence, as fingers,"

1907
01:51:56,793 --> 01:52:03,710
"You play tunes in the heart."

1908
01:52:04,043 --> 01:52:11,501
"On the same path by the eyes always"

1909
01:52:11,793 --> 01:52:18,293
"In the distance where lamp is shown"

1910
01:52:18,293 --> 01:52:25,501
"O sky of heart,
give the light of sun"

1911
01:52:25,710 --> 01:52:32,876
"O sky of heart,
give the light of sun.“

1912
01:52:36,876 --> 01:52:44,251
"The moon is fading as
the night is ending"

1913
01:52:44,251 --> 01:52:51,960
"Like a solitary star,
you are lonely"

1914
01:52:54,335 --> 01:52:57,668
Hello Farah! Where have you reached?

1915
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:01,251
In Palakkad which hospital?

1916
01:53:02,085 --> 01:53:05,460
Hello Farah! Can't you hear me?

1917
01:53:21,168 --> 01:53:22,126
Here it is!

1918
01:53:23,376 --> 01:53:25,168
I'm not able to concentrate on anything.

1919
01:53:25,501 --> 01:53:26,918
If I'd given appointments to anybody,

1920
01:53:26,918 --> 01:53:28,126
you please deal with them

1921
01:53:28,126 --> 01:53:29,668
Isn't the child safe?

1922
01:53:29,668 --> 01:53:30,835
That's what they said.

1923
01:53:31,043 --> 01:53:32,085
Farah is on the way.

1924
01:53:32,085 --> 01:53:33,710
Yesterday those Villa clients had come.

1925
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:35,210
GM Builders case.

1926
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:37,668
The other two complainants also
have signed the document.

1927
01:53:37,668 --> 01:53:38,751
That has to be filed.

1928
01:53:39,001 --> 01:53:40,376
Let my mind get relaxed.

1929
01:53:46,710 --> 01:53:48,585
I've not come to discuss
about the interview.

1930
01:53:50,376 --> 01:53:51,751
That's not the present problem.

1931
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:54,251
Then, why take the trouble of
following me?

1932
01:53:54,501 --> 01:53:55,460
Please leave me alone.

1933
01:53:56,293 --> 01:53:59,335
Okay. Still, please have my card!

1934
01:54:00,001 --> 01:54:02,168
If I could help you in
some way or other...

1935
01:54:02,168 --> 01:54:04,126
You can't help me in this.

1936
01:54:04,501 --> 01:54:08,751
Court, Law, earlier verdict
many such matters are involved.

1937
01:54:09,001 --> 01:54:10,501
You can't help me in any way.

1938
01:54:13,001 --> 01:54:14,335
But I will pray for you.

1939
01:54:16,501 --> 01:54:17,585
Thanks.

1940
01:54:32,043 --> 01:54:33,460
Did you see her?

1941
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:34,335
Tell me the truth.

1942
01:54:34,585 --> 01:54:37,043
Yes! Why don't you believe?

1943
01:54:37,585 --> 01:54:38,793
She's alright.

1944
01:54:39,001 --> 01:54:40,501
She asked you not to worry.

1945
01:54:41,543 --> 01:54:44,293
Rajeev is a wicked man. So cruel!

1946
01:54:44,668 --> 01:54:46,085
It's not that he needs the child...

1947
01:54:46,585 --> 01:54:47,543
He wants me to suffer!

1948
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:51,085
He very well knows that I'll
be shattered without the child.

1949
01:54:53,001 --> 01:54:53,918
Divorce is over.

1950
01:54:54,168 --> 01:54:55,501
And he has also married another woman.

1951
01:54:56,168 --> 01:54:57,460
Still, why this vengeance?

1952
01:54:57,668 --> 01:54:58,918
What did I do to him?

1953
01:54:58,918 --> 01:54:59,710
Cool down.

1954
01:55:00,085 --> 01:55:02,085
Think and find a better way.

1955
01:55:02,543 --> 01:55:03,918
What else is the way?

1956
01:55:04,543 --> 01:55:06,918
I need evidence to
prove that he's cruel!

1957
01:55:07,376 --> 01:55:09,251
But I don't have it.

1958
01:55:36,626 --> 01:55:38,043
They've come to meet you.

1959
01:55:38,043 --> 01:55:39,751
- GM Builders
- I know.

1960
01:55:49,543 --> 01:55:51,918
50 lakhs! Out of the court settlement!

1961
01:55:52,585 --> 01:55:55,751
I already told you, only
through bank and no cash.

1962
01:55:56,126 --> 01:55:57,751
And now...a new problem!

1963
01:55:58,043 --> 01:55:59,543
50 lakhs was enough that day!

1964
01:55:59,793 --> 01:56:01,168
<i>But now you have to pay 1.5 stores.</i>

1965
01:56:01,918 --> 01:56:04,126
Thinking that you'll not
settle it out of the court,

1966
01:56:04,126 --> 01:56:06,751
We involved two other persons
to make the case stronger.

1967
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,293
You have to settle
their amount also.

1968
01:56:08,793 --> 01:56:10,418
So, 50 lakhs is not enough.

1969
01:56:10,418 --> 01:56:13,293
1.5 crores is required.

1970
01:56:15,376 --> 01:56:16,460
Take that away.

1971
01:56:20,126 --> 01:56:21,918
You're playing without
realizing the consequences.

1972
01:56:22,168 --> 01:56:23,960
There won't be any chance
for another compromise.

1973
01:56:25,293 --> 01:56:28,793
Underworld not only
exist in Holly wood and Mumbai.

1974
01:56:28,793 --> 01:56:29,751
But in Kochi also.

1975
01:56:34,126 --> 01:56:34,793
Child?

1976
01:56:34,793 --> 01:56:35,876
Child is not here.

1977
01:56:35,876 --> 01:56:37,335
My Rosy is fond of it. Give me

1978
01:56:37,918 --> 01:56:38,668
You've it, dear.

1979
01:56:42,835 --> 01:56:44,168
- What's your good name?
- Bhairavan!

1980
01:56:44,376 --> 01:56:45,335
Bhairavan it seems!

1981
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:49,043
Boss!

1982
01:56:51,126 --> 01:56:52,918
It's better to give up hope on this.

1983
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:55,835
Anyway, we'll not get it on time also.

1984
01:56:56,751 --> 01:56:59,626
Court..Case..it'll take much time.

1985
01:57:00,626 --> 01:57:03,501
In this dire circumstance,
we can't expect her to talk.

1986
01:57:05,168 --> 01:57:07,293
With Advocate Deepa's cover photo,

1987
01:57:07,585 --> 01:57:11,043
I put aside 8 pages hoping
it to be a main article,

1988
01:57:14,668 --> 01:57:16,626
Something else

1989
01:57:18,585 --> 01:57:21,418
When an ordinary citizen
start reacting for normal issues,

1990
01:57:21,835 --> 01:57:23,918
extraordinary changes happen.

1991
01:57:24,626 --> 01:57:26,960
This was the theme I chose
for our Anniversary edition.

1992
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:30,460
Rest of the matters have
already been set with this theme.

1993
01:57:31,418 --> 01:57:35,460
Now I wonder what I should say
before the Director Board..

1994
01:57:39,335 --> 01:57:41,335
I never said it's your fault.

1995
01:57:42,251 --> 01:57:44,418
It's quite sad. It's not your fault!

1996
01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:49,043
I know you're very much tensed, Kalyani.

1997
01:57:49,835 --> 01:57:51,335
However, in this case, I'll...

1998
01:57:51,751 --> 01:57:53,918
Sorry..I'll not leave you
in the lurch, Madam.

1999
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:55,168
I promise!

2000
01:57:55,418 --> 01:57:57,585
Thanks! You can call me Kalyani!

2001
01:58:06,085 --> 01:58:07,751
I'll try and get that interview.

2002
01:58:09,043 --> 01:58:10,168
Don't worry.

2003
01:58:16,501 --> 01:58:18,251
Sir, tell me what should I do next.

2004
01:58:19,501 --> 01:58:25,918
Is it called greed if one wishes
to retain his head high in the office?

2005
01:58:26,376 --> 01:58:28,335
I'm in total disgrace, you know?

2006
01:58:29,043 --> 01:58:31,751
Hoping that you'll get me
out of troubles,

2007
01:58:31,751 --> 01:58:33,168
I break coconuts for you.

2008
01:58:33,376 --> 01:58:34,668
You know, how much does a coconut costs?

2009
01:58:40,085 --> 01:58:42,960
My today's prayers are not
like the usual ones.

2010
01:58:44,293 --> 01:58:46,251
Help me if you can.

2011
01:58:55,626 --> 01:58:57,001
Don't you've any other business to do?

2012
01:58:57,001 --> 01:58:58,293
You are always seen here.

2013
01:58:58,293 --> 01:58:59,543
Now I'm the priest of this temple.

2014
01:59:00,001 --> 01:59:01,460
So, is it you?

2015
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:02,460
That's the reason.

2016
01:59:02,710 --> 01:59:04,251
Your puja offerings are not correct!

2017
01:59:04,543 --> 01:59:06,168
That's why there's no
response from the Lord.

2018
01:59:46,293 --> 01:59:47,751
- Excuse me!
- Yes

2019
01:59:50,085 --> 01:59:51,168
Who's that man who went by that car?

2020
01:59:51,585 --> 01:59:52,543
I don't know.

2021
01:59:52,876 --> 01:59:54,835
He'd come here a couple
of times to have tea.

2022
01:59:55,585 --> 01:59:56,751
Taxi driver!

2023
01:59:57,043 --> 01:59:58,876
- What's the problem?
- Hey nothing

2024
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:12,251
Search a vehicle number on the internet.

2025
02:00:12,876 --> 02:00:17,835
KL07 BW 5202

2026
02:00:18,376 --> 02:00:20,335
A white color Verito car.

2027
02:00:20,876 --> 02:00:22,960
Check on whose name,
it's been registered.

2028
02:00:33,918 --> 02:00:38,668
Oh no! You'd gone wrong
Take a left from there.

2029
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:40,668
Turn...Turn the vehicle

2030
02:00:42,168 --> 02:00:46,251
Turn...take a left from there.

2031
02:00:49,376 --> 02:00:51,626
Since a long time you are
saying Left ...right...!

2032
02:00:52,085 --> 02:00:53,251
Making me mad!

2033
02:00:53,543 --> 02:00:55,210
Driver don't frighten me...

2034
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:57,251
I'll not make a mistake again.
You turn the vehicle

2035
02:00:57,585 --> 02:01:00,918
Once we get on to that road
we can keep on asking and go..

2036
02:01:05,418 --> 02:01:10,835
Do you know Click studio here?

2037
02:01:13,543 --> 02:01:14,668
You know Click studio?

2038
02:01:15,251 --> 02:01:17,043
He has forgotten the street name

2039
02:01:17,043 --> 02:01:18,543
Since a long time,
he's been wandering.

2040
02:01:18,543 --> 02:01:20,710
As I'm not too fit...I'm sorry

2041
02:01:21,376 --> 02:01:22,460
Click studio!

2042
02:01:23,001 --> 02:01:27,043
Ah!! Correct!
Sardar Vallabhai Patel road!

2043
02:01:27,293 --> 02:01:28,543
Not left! But right!

2044
02:01:28,793 --> 02:01:33,543
If you get onto that road,
We shall keep asking and go.

2045
02:01:33,918 --> 02:01:36,876
Iron man, Sardar Vallabhai Patel...

2046
02:01:46,251 --> 02:01:49,751
Sardar Vallabhai Patel!
Yes, this is the spot.

2047
02:02:04,918 --> 02:02:07,668
You come..I'll get you the money.

2048
02:02:08,168 --> 02:02:10,168
I guarantee for your money!

2049
02:02:11,876 --> 02:02:14,335
Lock the car and come..
full of thieves here.

2050
02:02:19,210 --> 02:02:21,210
- Jamal
- I am not Jamal! Jaleel!

2051
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:22,585
Both are same! Come with me.

2052
02:02:23,085 --> 02:02:25,251
See this! Click studio!

2053
02:02:28,501 --> 02:02:30,335
Hold me if you want

2054
02:02:32,335 --> 02:02:34,085
Do you like to take a photo?

2055
02:02:34,085 --> 02:02:35,335
Just give my money.

2056
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:40,251
Switch on the AC.

2057
02:02:40,710 --> 02:02:42,501
If the doors are shut,
chillness will not go off.

2058
02:02:42,751 --> 02:02:45,251
No sound will be heard outside

2059
02:02:45,251 --> 02:02:46,293
Sit here.

2060
02:02:49,418 --> 02:02:51,085
Is the scene clear for you?

2061
02:02:51,918 --> 02:02:53,626
<i>L</i> lust trapped you.

2062
02:02:54,543 --> 02:02:56,626
Sit down... sit down

2063
02:02:57,585 --> 02:03:01,043
On the road, before turning
towards Gandhi Nagar colony,

2064
02:03:01,043 --> 02:03:03,376
few days before,
did your car hit on a scooter?

2065
02:03:03,668 --> 02:03:05,501
And you sped without stopping.

2066
02:03:05,501 --> 02:03:07,751
A mother and daughter..You remember?

2067
02:03:09,376 --> 02:03:10,835
Yes, you must be remembering.

2068
02:03:12,376 --> 02:03:14,043
Why did you
go away without stopping?

2069
02:03:14,376 --> 02:03:15,918
Don't you've basic manners?

2070
02:03:16,376 --> 02:03:18,335
You should've stopped and
checked if they had got hurt.

2071
02:03:18,335 --> 02:03:19,668
After all a mother and daughter!

2072
02:03:20,001 --> 02:03:20,835
Open the door, I say.

2073
02:03:23,210 --> 02:03:28,960
So, you're not an
ordinary innocent driver!

2074
02:03:29,751 --> 02:03:32,335
You know, on whom your car had hit!

2075
02:03:32,335 --> 02:03:33,168
Leave my hands!

2076
02:03:33,585 --> 02:03:35,543
- Do you know or not?
- Leave my hand.

2077
02:03:35,543 --> 02:03:37,168
So, you know!

2078
02:03:37,168 --> 02:03:39,585
Mathan, is the camera ready?

2079
02:03:39,585 --> 02:03:40,335
Yes, ready!

2080
02:03:40,710 --> 02:03:42,876
Start camera. Action.

2081
02:03:44,626 --> 02:03:47,043
When I saw you...
When I saw your face...

2082
02:03:47,335 --> 02:03:50,293
I had an intuition that
you know Advocate Deepa.

2083
02:03:50,293 --> 02:03:53,251
That means if I whack you to pulp..

2084
02:03:53,251 --> 02:03:54,876
You'll have a backstory to say.

2085
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:57,710
If you dare touch me,
you'll be in trouble.

2086
02:03:58,335 --> 02:03:59,626
Don't bruise yourself needlessly.

2087
02:03:59,626 --> 02:04:01,793
Oh no! Sorry..

2088
02:04:03,293 --> 02:04:05,168
So, you're the type I intended!

2089
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:06,668
You've people behind you.

2090
02:04:07,168 --> 02:04:09,751
Now from your looks I can guess that

2091
02:04:09,751 --> 02:04:15,376
someone had planned to assault Advocate
Deepa when she comes riding the scooter.

2092
02:04:15,751 --> 02:04:17,501
If it was your own idea,

2093
02:04:17,501 --> 02:04:19,460
then, you needn't say anything,
I'll kill you

2094
02:04:19,835 --> 02:04:23,168
Or if you say somebody
is behind all this,

2095
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:25,085
I'll thrash and change the
shape of your face.

2096
02:04:31,335 --> 02:04:32,251
Bro! Album!

2097
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:42,960
You're skilled in these martial arts.
I am ready!

2098
02:04:46,251 --> 02:04:47,210
Give me.

2099
02:05:45,501 --> 02:05:47,043
Enough! I'll tell you.

2100
02:05:47,668 --> 02:05:48,293
What did you say?

2101
02:05:48,585 --> 02:05:49,168
I'll tell you.

2102
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:53,710
On behest of Palakkad
Advocate Sundarajan,

2103
02:05:54,043 --> 02:05:55,085
I've taken up this quotation.

2104
02:05:55,376 --> 02:05:56,501
What was the quotation?

2105
02:05:56,751 --> 02:05:57,543
To kill her?

2106
02:05:58,668 --> 02:06:00,835
When Advocate Deepa returns
from School with the child,

2107
02:06:00,835 --> 02:06:02,168
I was asked to knock her down.

2108
02:06:03,251 --> 02:06:04,626
Just to knock her down?

2109
02:06:06,543 --> 02:06:07,835
Yes, that's what I was told.

2110
02:06:09,585 --> 02:06:14,168
Is it possible to get back the
child legally like they did?

2111
02:06:14,918 --> 02:06:17,126
They know to deal such
matters better than us.

2112
02:06:17,501 --> 02:06:20,585
That is why even after the child
was alright, they didn't discharge her.

2113
02:06:22,126 --> 02:06:24,501
Only If the hospital gives a certificate
about child's recovery,

2114
02:06:24,501 --> 02:06:26,668
We can move in the
name of her schooling.

2115
02:06:32,543 --> 02:06:33,751
Isn't Advocate at home?

2116
02:06:35,501 --> 02:06:36,876
Vanitharathnam!

2117
02:06:43,001 --> 02:06:44,335
I want only the advocate to come!

2118
02:06:48,918 --> 02:06:51,501
Come with me.
Something that'll be helpful to you.

2119
02:06:52,335 --> 02:06:53,710
It can't be told here, that's why.

2120
02:06:55,376 --> 02:06:58,335
Although Farah is your best friend,

2121
02:06:58,335 --> 02:07:00,335
She told lies and handed me
over to Police.

2122
02:07:00,793 --> 02:07:02,335
So, I have no trust in her.
I am sorry

2123
02:07:04,043 --> 02:07:05,293
Let's go.

2124
02:07:32,543 --> 02:07:33,835
There's a video in this Tab!

2125
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:36,918
I've set everything.

2126
02:07:38,085 --> 02:07:40,585
Put on the earphone and watch it.

2127
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:15,918
Advocate Sundarajan, is the
one we'd seen in the hospital, right?

2128
02:08:16,793 --> 02:08:18,335
Hm...Yes!

2129
02:08:19,835 --> 02:08:21,835
Why does he have so much
hatred towards you?

2130
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:23,710
Professional jealously?

2131
02:08:24,626 --> 02:08:26,001
Jealously is not for the Advocate

2132
02:08:26,585 --> 02:08:27,710
But for my Ex!

2133
02:08:28,793 --> 02:08:29,793
EX?

2134
02:08:30,376 --> 02:08:31,543
Ex-husband!

2135
02:08:32,543 --> 02:08:33,376
Mia's dad!

2136
02:08:33,793 --> 02:08:34,876
My God!

2137
02:08:36,043 --> 02:08:37,251
It's so cruel!

2138
02:08:38,293 --> 02:08:40,418
To his own child,
a deliberate accident!

2139
02:08:42,168 --> 02:08:44,043
Can any dad does that?

2140
02:08:45,251 --> 02:08:46,293
Yes!

2141
02:08:46,918 --> 02:08:48,501
This was the evidence
I was looking for.

2142
02:08:49,210 --> 02:08:50,293
This Video alone is not adequate.

2143
02:08:50,626 --> 02:08:52,501
If you could bring him as
a witness in the Court,

2144
02:08:52,751 --> 02:08:54,960
then, Rajeev can't even
come near my shadow.

2145
02:08:55,251 --> 02:08:56,835
Or even touch my child.

2146
02:08:57,251 --> 02:08:59,085
I'll be free from this problem

2147
02:08:59,585 --> 02:09:00,418
...forever.

2148
02:09:02,835 --> 02:09:05,543
This man will surely be
a witness in the Court.

2149
02:09:15,251 --> 02:09:16,210
Do you know my number?

2150
02:09:16,418 --> 02:09:18,043
My number is on the
visiting card I'd given you.

2151
02:09:18,293 --> 02:09:19,335
Just give a missed call.

2152
02:09:19,543 --> 02:09:20,376
I'll save it.

2153
02:09:20,376 --> 02:09:22,376
Sorry, I don't know where I kept it.

2154
02:09:22,376 --> 02:09:23,293
I'll tell you my number.

2155
02:09:37,335 --> 02:09:39,793
We can't keep a hold that
driver for long

2156
02:09:40,543 --> 02:09:42,543
Take appropriate action..

2157
02:09:42,543 --> 02:09:45,376
...as soon as possible
to present him before the Court,

2158
02:10:01,418 --> 02:10:04,793
Deepa can take her child immediately.

2159
02:10:05,668 --> 02:10:07,460
Though he did this through an advocate,
the fact that

2160
02:10:07,793 --> 02:10:11,751
he was the child's own father
adds gravity to this problem.

2161
02:10:12,585 --> 02:10:13,918
In spite of getting all these thrashes,

2162
02:10:14,168 --> 02:10:15,960
it's a wonder that you're still alive.

2163
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:18,585
Absolutely no scratches
or bruises on your body.

2164
02:10:19,376 --> 02:10:22,251
That means, one who thrashed you,
must be a master in it.

2165
02:10:24,293 --> 02:10:28,043
The honorable Court hasn't ever
witnessed such a brutal interrogation.

2166
02:10:28,793 --> 02:10:30,335
Although it was to bring out the truth,

2167
02:10:30,751 --> 02:10:34,210
for thrashing the accused
so brutally and mercilessly,

2168
02:10:34,418 --> 02:10:39,043
This court directs to charge
a case on the person seen in this video

2169
02:10:45,293 --> 02:10:47,751
Bloody Mathan!!!
You'll take my life out!

2170
02:10:48,376 --> 02:10:49,793
In the visuals produced in the Court,

2171
02:10:50,335 --> 02:10:51,876
only his confession
was needed, right?

2172
02:10:52,085 --> 02:10:54,293
Who told you to add the entire
thrashings I gave him?

2173
02:10:54,835 --> 02:10:55,668
For effects?

2174
02:10:56,043 --> 02:10:57,001
I'll show you those effects!

2175
02:10:57,001 --> 02:10:58,460
Don't go anywhere..I'm coming there.

2176
02:11:09,418 --> 02:11:11,543
See! What I've got
in return for my help!

2177
02:11:11,793 --> 02:11:15,001
If I'm charged, please get me
an anticipatory bail.

2178
02:11:15,001 --> 02:11:16,293
Not only anticipatory bail,

2179
02:11:16,293 --> 02:11:17,918
Deepa will even take up your case!

2180
02:11:18,168 --> 02:11:19,543
What a great help you've done!

2181
02:11:19,543 --> 02:11:20,668
When are you going to Palakkad?

2182
02:11:20,668 --> 02:11:22,168
I'll receive the papers
in an hour's time.

2183
02:11:22,168 --> 02:11:23,543
And also get police's
help from Palakkad.

2184
02:11:23,793 --> 02:11:25,460
I shall also come with you
Suppose you have any trouble there

2185
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:26,501
There won't be any more problems.

2186
02:11:26,751 --> 02:11:30,710
No, if there's any brawl, it's safer
if you have a goonda with you.

2187
02:11:31,001 --> 02:11:32,293
I was a Boxer earlier.

2188
02:11:32,710 --> 02:11:34,168
- Which hospital?
- Kinder hospital.

2189
02:11:34,835 --> 02:11:36,793
Before you reach there, I'll be there.

2190
02:11:37,126 --> 02:11:39,418
Don't take the trouble!
Farah is with me.

2191
02:11:39,418 --> 02:11:40,460
Moreover, it's my home town.

2192
02:11:40,710 --> 02:11:45,168
Right! But a curiosity to see
the child reaching your hands.

2193
02:11:45,668 --> 02:11:47,876
Moreover, I'm a Journalist, right?

2194
02:11:51,085 --> 02:11:53,793
Hell with your sorry!
Hang the phone down Rascal!

2195
02:12:02,585 --> 02:12:03,835
Show me, aunty!

2196
02:12:03,835 --> 02:12:07,626
I'll not give.
- Let me see!

2197
02:12:07,626 --> 02:12:09,501
There..that last room.

2198
02:12:19,876 --> 02:12:20,710
<i>MOW.!</i>

2199
02:12:34,751 --> 02:12:38,251
She's Dr. Usha! Rajeev's wife!

2200
02:12:46,001 --> 02:12:47,460
I can understand your situation.

2201
02:12:48,251 --> 02:12:50,626
You know about Rajeev...
I can't do...

2202
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:53,626
You don't have to say anything
I can understand.

2203
02:12:54,543 --> 02:12:56,501
She became a good company for you.

2204
02:12:57,126 --> 02:12:58,918
Yes! I took leave and stayed with her.

2205
02:12:59,376 --> 02:13:00,751
She's really smart!

2206
02:13:01,043 --> 02:13:02,168
You're lucky

2207
02:13:03,543 --> 02:13:04,751
Thanks“

2208
02:13:05,668 --> 02:13:06,960
For taking good care of my daughter..

2209
02:13:07,376 --> 02:13:08,460
...and loving her..

2210
02:13:11,001 --> 02:13:13,043
We need to reach Ernakulam soon!

2211
02:13:13,418 --> 02:13:14,543
See you then.

2212
02:13:14,835 --> 02:13:16,751
I'm not coming. Call me when you reach.

2213
02:13:17,793 --> 02:13:18,876
See you, aunty.

2214
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:40,335
Why were you behind me like a shadow
and so adamant to help me ?

2215
02:13:42,085 --> 02:13:43,043
Do you feel so?

2216
02:13:43,335 --> 02:13:45,335
Just for an interview,
taking too much of pains..

2217
02:13:45,835 --> 02:13:47,585
Am I that important?

2218
02:13:49,168 --> 02:13:52,251
I've plenty to say, if I talk
about your importance,

2219
02:13:54,626 --> 02:14:00,918
A woman whom I'd never seen,
heard or known in my lifetime,

2220
02:14:01,835 --> 02:14:05,293
all of a sudden turns out to be my
biggest problem on one fine afternoon.

2221
02:14:07,126 --> 02:14:12,043
A challenge to my job,
dignity and manliness.

2222
02:14:12,376 --> 02:14:14,376
And also becomes a headache...

2223
02:14:14,376 --> 02:14:15,335
...Advocate Deepa!

2224
02:14:15,710 --> 02:14:17,293
That's why I'm asking you...Why ?

2225
02:14:20,418 --> 02:14:27,335
An invisible string which we cannot
see is binding us with something.

2226
02:14:28,668 --> 02:14:30,210
Pulling a few among
them closer,

2227
02:14:30,585 --> 02:14:31,835
and a few apart.

2228
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:35,710
In a big game played by someone
above our head,

2229
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:38,668
we also become a part of it.

2230
02:14:41,001 --> 02:14:42,335
Just look at it that way.

2231
02:14:44,710 --> 02:14:47,543
Only for the interview,
I came to meet you.

2232
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:52,001
But whatever I do for you
including this journey

2233
02:14:52,668 --> 02:14:54,168
is not for the sake of the interview.

2234
02:14:56,043 --> 02:14:59,460
I've good respect for you.

2235
02:15:02,043 --> 02:15:04,168
Most of the qualities which my mom had,

2236
02:15:05,210 --> 02:15:06,001
you too have.

2237
02:15:08,210 --> 02:15:09,293
That...

2238
02:15:11,376 --> 02:15:12,751
That touched me a lot.

2239
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:16,835
To be frank, as we didn't
get your interview,

2240
02:15:17,293 --> 02:15:20,876
Our anniversary edition is
stuck with last minute confusion.

2241
02:15:22,751 --> 02:15:24,251
But that doesn't matter.

2242
02:15:24,626 --> 02:15:27,168
I'll never come again to
trouble you in that name.

2243
02:15:28,293 --> 02:15:29,876
It's enough if you are happy...

2244
02:15:30,626 --> 02:15:32,293
Anytime...All the time!

2245
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:44,751
Dear, get up! We've reached.

2246
02:15:46,751 --> 02:15:48,626
- Have they reached, hubby?
- Yes

2247
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:59,210
Put her to bed and make her sleep.

2248
02:15:59,418 --> 02:16:01,876
My sweety! Have you slept?

2249
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:04,335
We were waiting for you.

2250
02:16:06,043 --> 02:16:07,126
Thanks.

2251
02:16:09,168 --> 02:16:12,918
We can't say who'll help us
when and how in our life.

2252
02:16:13,335 --> 02:16:15,085
The one whom we considered as enemy,

2253
02:16:15,085 --> 02:16:17,418
may finally turn out to be the
helping hand in our life!

2254
02:16:17,918 --> 02:16:19,085
You're a nice man!

2255
02:16:19,335 --> 02:16:21,168
All of us are grateful to you.

2256
02:16:21,376 --> 02:16:23,168
It's not a matter of gratefulness!

2257
02:16:24,418 --> 02:16:27,168
I just want to see the relaxation
on the Advocate's face.

2258
02:16:28,626 --> 02:16:29,918
Even if I don't get the interview..

2259
02:16:30,501 --> 02:16:31,585
I'm happy-

2260
02:16:32,710 --> 02:16:33,876
I'm not saying it simply!
I really mean it.

2261
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:36,835
What if I need an interview?

2262
02:16:38,376 --> 02:16:40,126
I'm not saying it simply!
I really mean it..

2263
02:16:40,543 --> 02:16:42,376
Please come in the morning.
I'll be ready.

2264
02:16:48,585 --> 02:16:52,001
"On the bough of the flower tree,"

2265
02:16:52,001 --> 02:16:55,085
"On the tip of the lovely cloud,“

2266
02:16:55,501 --> 02:16:59,085
"On the edge of the rainbow,"

2267
02:16:59,085 --> 02:17:02,543
"Swing, O bird!"

2268
02:17:02,751 --> 02:17:06,085
"Don't wriggle when embraced,"

2269
02:17:06,085 --> 02:17:09,293
"Don't flap your wings."

2270
02:17:09,585 --> 02:17:13,126
"On the seat of my heart"

2271
02:17:13,126 --> 02:17:16,335
"Swing, O bird!"

2272
02:17:16,668 --> 02:17:20,168
"Come when the heat is gone,"

2273
02:17:20,168 --> 02:17:23,293
"Come when the day is over,"

2274
02:17:23,626 --> 02:17:30,710
"O Love bird, Swing, O bird!"

2275
02:17:30,710 --> 02:17:33,626
"On the bough of the flower tree,"

2276
02:17:34,085 --> 02:17:37,085
"On the tip of the lovely cloud,“

2277
02:17:37,668 --> 02:17:40,668
"On the edge of the rainbow,"

2278
02:17:41,168 --> 02:17:44,335
"Swing, O bird!"

2279
02:18:00,793 --> 02:18:01,668
Everything is OK!

2280
02:18:03,085 --> 02:18:04,251
- Went well too!
- What?

2281
02:18:04,543 --> 02:18:06,626
Vanitharathnam's anniversary edition

2282
02:18:06,626 --> 02:18:08,460
Will be published with
Advocate Deepa's cover story.

2283
02:18:08,460 --> 02:18:09,668
Interview will be taken today.
I'll do the write-up today.

2284
02:18:09,668 --> 02:18:10,876
And it'll go for printing tomorrow.

2285
02:18:10,876 --> 02:18:12,168
- Really?
- Yes.

2286
02:18:19,126 --> 02:18:23,085
We shall go to Manjusha's house
on Saturday and copy the missed notes.

2287
02:18:23,501 --> 02:18:24,918
I've told her mummy..

2288
02:18:25,585 --> 02:18:27,210
Ishan's note is enough for me.

2289
02:18:27,710 --> 02:18:28,960
I'll get it home today.

2290
02:18:30,126 --> 02:18:32,001
For you to take it home,
he has to first give it, right?

2291
02:18:32,376 --> 02:18:33,168
Doesn't he have to study?

2292
02:18:33,585 --> 02:18:35,793
He'll give me..He loves me.

2293
02:18:36,710 --> 02:18:37,751
Love?

2294
02:18:38,376 --> 02:18:39,835
But you never told me this till now.

2295
02:18:40,543 --> 02:18:42,126
Let me check if it's real love.

2296
02:18:42,126 --> 02:18:43,126
Then, I'll say

2297
02:18:44,710 --> 02:18:46,043
How do we find that?

2298
02:18:46,668 --> 02:18:47,793
Must wait.

2299
02:18:48,210 --> 02:18:50,918
Good Lord!! You're just in Grade 3!

2300
02:18:57,543 --> 02:18:59,001
I just reached little early!!

2301
02:18:59,376 --> 02:19:01,543
You leave as usual. I shall wait.

2302
02:19:02,085 --> 02:19:05,626
"A moon of love"

2303
02:19:05,626 --> 02:19:06,543
"From the grove of the clear sky"

2304
02:19:06,543 --> 02:19:07,835
Take left from that junction.

2305
02:19:08,751 --> 02:19:10,293
I know the way to her School

2306
02:19:11,918 --> 02:19:13,835
The way I chased you...

2307
02:19:14,168 --> 02:19:17,085
I never ever chased
anybody in my lifetime.

2308
02:19:19,626 --> 02:19:22,835
A moon of love
from the grove of the clear sky

2309
02:19:23,126 --> 02:19:25,376
In the dark blue eyes

2310
02:19:25,376 --> 02:19:28,918
RAJEEV - the chapter,
which I wish to forget.

2311
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:32,168
We were together only
for <i>2</i> months since marriage.

2312
02:19:33,210 --> 02:19:34,626
I was escaping.

2313
02:19:37,876 --> 02:19:40,335
I did only that whatever
I felt right to my conscience...

2314
02:19:40,585 --> 02:19:41,751
Henceforth also I'll be the same.

2315
02:19:42,168 --> 02:19:44,293
My life... is only mine.

2316
02:19:44,293 --> 02:19:50,710
"O bird of my heart, Swing, O bird"

2317
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:54,335
"On the bough of the flower tree,"

2318
02:19:54,585 --> 02:19:57,668
"On the tip of the lovely cloud,“

2319
02:19:58,085 --> 02:20:01,376
"On the edge of the rainbow,"

2320
02:20:01,626 --> 02:20:05,085
"Swing, O bird"

2321
02:20:05,876 --> 02:20:07,376
Shall I get you the meals?

2322
02:20:07,376 --> 02:20:11,418
Fish. ..Prawn..Duck...Mussles
and Beef.. available.

2323
02:20:11,418 --> 02:20:12,751
I will order later.

2324
02:20:14,126 --> 02:20:15,335
Yes, what do you want?

2325
02:20:15,710 --> 02:20:18,876
Fish. ..Prawn..Duck...Mussles
and Beef.. available.

2326
02:20:18,876 --> 02:20:21,710
This is his usual business.

2327
02:20:24,585 --> 02:20:28,710
You said interview, but I didn't
see you noting it down anything

2328
02:20:29,668 --> 02:20:31,210
To recollect what you said,

2329
02:20:31,626 --> 02:20:33,168
I don't require any pen or pencil..

2330
02:20:35,043 --> 02:20:36,543
I'm a Senior Journalist, you know?

2331
02:20:42,210 --> 02:20:44,001
You appearance is soft,

2332
02:20:44,668 --> 02:20:47,168
but your decisions are powerful!

2333
02:20:47,376 --> 02:20:48,751
Were you like this in your childhood?

2334
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:09,293
My dad was my role model.

2335
02:21:10,668 --> 02:21:12,293
When I was doing my degree,
my dad expired.

2336
02:21:13,460 --> 02:21:15,085
Between me and my mom,
there's always fight.

2337
02:21:15,668 --> 02:21:19,168
Both of us have two
different beliefs, characters..

2338
02:21:19,543 --> 02:21:23,043
"When the whole millet field awaits it,"

2339
02:21:23,043 --> 02:21:29,626
"Come to this dew drop
as the boon of dawn"

2340
02:21:29,626 --> 02:21:36,751
"A thousand lamps are smiling now "

2341
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:40,585
"O bird of my heart"

2342
02:21:40,876 --> 02:21:44,085
"Swing, O bird!"

2343
02:21:44,376 --> 02:21:47,501
"On the bough of the flower tree,"

2344
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:50,960
"On the tip of the lovely cloud,“

2345
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:54,918
"On the edge of the rainbow,"

2346
02:21:54,918 --> 02:21:58,043
"Swing, O bird!"

2347
02:21:58,501 --> 02:22:01,001
"Come when the heat is gone,"

2348
02:22:01,001 --> 02:22:02,293
I don't plan anything now.

2349
02:22:02,876 --> 02:22:05,043
My life doesn't take me as per my plan.

2350
02:22:05,501 --> 02:22:08,960
“O my beloved bird”

2351
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:12,460
“O my magically bird of love”

2352
02:22:18,501 --> 02:22:19,668
Thanks for a..

2353
02:22:21,626 --> 02:22:22,751
Thanks for a great day!

2354
02:22:46,001 --> 02:22:49,085
Cash not accepted.
50 lakhs not enough.

2355
02:22:49,501 --> 02:22:51,710
1.5 crores required.
Right, Advocate Deepa?

2356
02:22:53,376 --> 02:22:54,418
Yes.

2357
02:22:58,585 --> 02:22:59,710
This isl.5 crores!

2358
02:23:00,085 --> 02:23:01,335
Check whether the names are correct!

2359
02:23:04,543 --> 02:23:05,751
I need my lawyer fees also.

2360
02:23:06,710 --> 02:23:08,335
How much is your lawyer fees?

2361
02:23:08,793 --> 02:23:09,918
- Rs.25..
-25000...

2362
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:14,626
Till last year 25,000 was the fees she
charged for a similar case

2363
02:23:14,626 --> 02:23:15,626
Now it is 50,000.

2364
02:23:16,335 --> 02:23:17,668
Advocate has become famous!

2365
02:23:17,668 --> 02:23:19,043
Thus rate is doubled!

2366
02:23:20,168 --> 02:23:22,168
I don't mind even if it's cash.

2367
02:23:24,585 --> 02:23:28,085
Underworld doesn't exist only
in Hollywood and Mumbai.

2368
02:23:28,085 --> 02:23:29,960
But also in Kochi! Yes!

2369
02:23:30,335 --> 02:23:31,751
- Bhairava
- Boss

2370
02:23:32,501 --> 02:23:33,335
Give it to her.

2371
02:23:40,918 --> 02:23:41,835
Fifty thousand!

2372
02:23:45,043 --> 02:23:48,293
Boss! I haven't got into the car.

2373
02:24:18,210 --> 02:24:19,668
The usual room, I sit.

2374
02:24:20,793 --> 02:24:22,251
The usual pen I write.

2375
02:24:23,876 --> 02:24:26,501
The usual rain in the month of Thulam

2376
02:24:27,751 --> 02:24:30,543
But there's something
unusual in my heart.

2377
02:24:55,585 --> 02:24:56,710
Tell me, Deepa.

2378
02:24:56,710 --> 02:24:58,001
I forgot to ask you something.

2379
02:24:59,126 --> 02:25:00,960
Why don't you smear
sacred sandal mark now?

2380
02:25:02,626 --> 02:25:07,001
Sandal Mark...nobody likes it.

2381
02:25:07,626 --> 02:25:09,335
You must smear it!
I like it.

2382
02:25:10,043 --> 02:25:10,918
What?

2383
02:25:11,293 --> 02:25:12,418
I like it.

2384
02:25:29,001 --> 02:25:30,210
Hereafter I can write..

2385
02:25:31,001 --> 02:25:32,293
The story which Deepa said,

2386
02:25:33,418 --> 02:25:34,585
And also the unsaid story!

2387
02:25:43,335 --> 02:25:45,835
ANY TIME...ALL THE TIME
