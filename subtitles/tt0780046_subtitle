1
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:17,116
<i>Do not abandon us.</i>

2
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:21,054
<i>We need you in this moment.</i>

3
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,653
<i>Protect us from committing</i>
<i>acts you won't forgive.</i>

4
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:31,462
<i>Help us remove this desire</i>
<i>and replace it with love.</i>

5
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:36,602
<i>Let us die as Muslims. Amen.</i>

6
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:41,506
<i>In the name of Allah,</i>
<i>most benevolent, ever-merciful,</i>

7
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:46,848
<i>Muhammad, the Prophet of Allah:</i>
<i>And those who are truly with him</i>

8
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:51,690
<i>are severe with infidels</i>

9
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:54,761
<i>but compassionate</i>
<i>among themselves.</i>

10
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:58,592
<i>You may see them kneeling</i>
<i>and bowing in reverence.</i>

11
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:02,964
<i>Seeking acceptance</i>
<i>from the Grace of Allah.</i>

12
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:07,233
<i>Seeking His favor and acceptance.</i>

13
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:16,112
<i>Their mark is on their foreheads</i>
<i>from the effect of their prostrations.</i>

14
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:58,716
God is everything to me.
He is the source of my strength.

15
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:00,945
He is the center of my life.

16
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:10,925
<i>You said, over national radio,</i>

17
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:14,933
<i>"I am Muslim, I'm an lmam,</i>
<i>and I'm gay. "

18
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,400
<i>Did it ever occur to you that,</i>

19
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:20,667
<i>"Listen, I'm going to be hurting</i>
<i>the feelings of thousands of Muslims"?</i>

20
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:22,537
<i>Yes, I fully understand that,</i>

21
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:24,906
<i>but what we also need to understand</i>
<i>is that the issue</i>

22
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:28,276
<i>of homosexuality</i>
<i>within the Muslim community is real.</i>

23
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:31,350
<i>These are the lives of people</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

24
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:36,016
<i>On a daily basis, I deal with</i>
<i>young Muslims who have a problem,</i>

25
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,682
<i>and they are struggling</i>
<i>with reconciling their Islam</i>

26
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,191
<i>with their sexuality.</i>

27
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:43,694
<i>So instead of them leaving Islam,</i>
<i>or committing suicide,</i>

28
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:47,756
<i>what I basically do in my work in</i>
<i>counseling with them is to tell them</i>

29
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:50,495
<i>to accept Islam for the goodness</i>
<i>that it comes with</i>

30
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:54,129
<i>and reconcile it with their sexuality</i>
<i>because their sexuality,</i>

31
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,968
<i>at the end of the day,</i>

32
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,475
<i>is not something that's going</i>
<i>to disappear.</i>

33
00:04:57,944 --> 00:05:02,813
<i>Stick to the Islam, and let Allah be</i>
<i>the judge of it at the end of the day.</i>

34
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:08,888
<i>I think Muhsin should be thrown off</i>
<i>a mountain or burned or something.</i>

35
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:12,789
<i>You can't call that guy</i>
<i>a brother, man, a Muslim brother.</i>

36
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,759
<i>They must cut off</i>
<i>his fucking arse, man.</i>

37
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,888
<i>We should definitely bring back</i>
<i>the death sentence for this guy.</i>

38
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:21,832
<i>It's unacceptable, he's bringing down</i>
<i>the name of Islam.</i>

39
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,235
My grandfather was an lmam,

40
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:33,141
my mother is a teacher
in the community.

41
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:36,272
I was virtually born in a mosque.

42
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:41,353
It's only at the age of about 16

43
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:44,048
that I decided that,
"There's something wrong with me.

44
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:46,455
I'm not like the other boys.

45
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:51,121
I need to find out from this God
why did He make me like this?

46
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:52,731
If it's something that I can change,

47
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:55,528
then, certainly, He'll be able
to help me to change it."

48
00:05:57,337 --> 00:06:02,969
I was about 20 when I went to Pakistan
to study Islam.

49
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,406
When I read the verses on Sodom
and Gomorrah, there was lots of guilt

50
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:10,449
because at that time I thought,

51
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,280
"Okay, this is it,
this is what God thinks of me.

52
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:18,449
So, why am I still adhering to Islam
when there's no space for me?"

53
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,657
I eventually decided
that maybe I should try

54
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:23,592
and get married to a woman.

55
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,727
So I went home, got married,
I brought my wife with me to Pakistan,

56
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:31,099
and I finished another
three years of studies after that.

57
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:34,334
I also had a best friend in Pakistan,

58
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:37,035
and we were just purely,
platonic friends.

59
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:41,603
But at the time when he left,
I could not contain myself.

60
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:45,309
I was just crying all the way
in the taxi back home.

61
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:49,179
My wife said,
"So, were you in love with him?"

62
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:50,956
And at that point,

63
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:54,618
I just felt that it was necessary
for me to tell her the truth.

64
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:17,171
"Remember, nobody can take you
for their daddy.

65
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,843
You my daddy, the best."

66
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:25,821
"Love is tender, love is true,
love is hopeless without you."

67
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,660
"I love you, and I miss you a lot,

68
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:32,562
and I can't sleep by you
for the holidays."

69
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,599
This was one holiday
when their mother said,

70
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,498
"No, you're not going to sleep
by your daddy

71
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:40,061
because he's all over the radio."

72
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:43,900
They always wanted to know
whether I wanted to see them,

73
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,945
whether I was happy to see them.

74
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:17,835
They aren't very friendly.

75
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:23,176
They can't do anything.

76
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:30,879
Give him one, give him one.
He just wants food.

77
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,185
This is chickpea.

78
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,256
Look at you!

79
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,898
But it's not bad.

80
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,337
He's evil!

81
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:51,975
I always have this attitude
with my children

82
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:54,603
that I'm not going to take
challenges away from them.

83
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:57,880
It's probably in their fate

84
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:01,253
that they were going to end up
with a father that's gay

85
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,515
and deep down inside,
I just felt that it's important

86
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,988
for me to take them
through these struggles

87
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,686
because at the end of it,
they will come out stronger.

88
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:12,531
Do you think gay people
should be stoned to death?

89
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,096
- Yes.
- No, they didn't say so.

90
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,293
They said they must chop off their
heads and throw them off a mountain.

91
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:18,336
Do you think they should do that?

92
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:19,564
- Yes.
- No.

93
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,664
Yes.

94
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,205
Why do you say yes?

95
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:26,870
Because you don't want to buy me
a KFO burger.

96
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:31,245
But they don't do that here!

97
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:32,473
They do it in Egypt.

98
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,416
How would you feel
if they should do that?

99
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:42,091
I would say, "If all of you must be
stoned to death, how will you feel?"

100
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,060
What would you do?

101
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:48,156
Would you just stand there and cry?

102
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:49,997
And go <i>on...</i>

103
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:52,970
"Please don't stone me to death!"

104
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:58,171
I'm now so open and on TV,
and now this movie and everything,

105
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,214
and what if they decide
to now catch me?

106
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,381
Oan you picture it?

107
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:07,510
There, they come for your daddy.
They put him in chains.

108
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,550
What will you do?

109
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:11,852
I would look them in the eye and say,
"Oh, don't let my daddy feel this.

110
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,827
And just let him die one time
with the first stone."

111
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:19,094
No, but seriously.

112
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:21,028
But will you come and help me?

113
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,965
Yes. Maybe.

114
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:26,596
If somebody must hurt you,
then I will give up my life for you.

115
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:29,264
- But you don't want to save me.
- You're talking nonsense!

116
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:34,813
I will save you, Daddy!
I will save you!

117
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:40,848
I think my personal story,
it's "A love Jihad."

118
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,582
It's a struggle, and that's
what the word <i>Jihad</i> is all about.

119
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:48,058
A <i>Jihad</i> is not a holy war.
It's a struggle.

120
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:50,823
And a <i>Jihad ul-Nafs</i>
is a struggle with the self.

121
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:56,328
I just felt I needed to come out.

122
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:01,430
At that time, I was teaching
at two <i>madrassas</i> [schools],

123
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:05,200
and they asked me to resign.

124
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,641
I was scared to death
because I know my community.

125
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:15,880
I know the mentality
of the Muslim community.

126
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:18,958
I was prepared to die.

127
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:25,589
I was in Makkah [Mecca],

128
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:30,362
and they told me
that there is an <i>lmam</i> in Oape Town,

129
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,701
and he says that homosexuality is
permissible, so I said, "lmpossible!"

130
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:39,836
So I said, "Fine, if he wants to
discuss it, then we can discuss it."

131
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:43,081
I myself am homosexual.
I know what I've been through.

132
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:46,948
I got married because I thought
that was going to change me.

133
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:52,514
I fasted 80 days every year
besides the month of <i>Ramadan,</i>

134
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,560
asking Allah to help me
to just get rid of these things.

135
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:58,721
They haven't moved. I have started
with this thing from the age of 12.

136
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:01,664
At the age of 5, I recognized
that I was different from other boys.

137
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,526
We feel that it's not a choice
that we make.

138
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:08,232
That somehow the <i>Qur'an</i>
should be speaking about us, as well.

139
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:10,536
That we also have rights
as human beings.

140
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:12,008
What do you say?

141
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:15,547
Is homosexuality permissible in Islam?
Is that what you're promoting?

142
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:18,344
We will consider you a <i>Murtad,</i>
an apostate,

143
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,214
and out of the fold of Islam.

144
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,344
You will not be buried
in a Muslim graveyard.

145
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:25,947
No Muslim person would ever read
your <i>Salat ul-Janaza</i> [funeral prayer].

146
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:28,357
We have looked at all these verses
from the <i>Qur'an,</i>

147
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,452
and, obviously,
we have a different interpretation

148
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:31,757
of what has happened then.

149
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:37,302
No person can make interpretations
to suit his desires, or her desires,

150
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,598
when you have clear-cut <i>verses:</i>

151
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:42,572
<i>And when Lot, peace be upon him</i>

152
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:46,475
<i>When he addressed</i>
<i>his people and told them:</i>

153
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,310
<i>"Do you commit and bring</i>
<i>that obscene and lewd action</i>

154
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,078
<i>where a male fulfills his desire</i>
<i>with a male?"</i>

155
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:55,279
We cannot just take
the verses from the <i>Qur'an</i>

156
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:59,017
and use it as a blanket condemnation
for homosexuality.

157
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,750
When foreigners and guests came
into the city of Sodom and Gomorrah,

158
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:05,353
these men were rushing
to molest them.

159
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:06,363
As the <i>Qur'an</i> says,

160
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:09,765
it was an abomination that they've
been doing for a long time.

161
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:12,997
So, it was male to male rape.

162
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,040
So Allah doesn't refer
to the homosexual relationship here,

163
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:18,940
but he's referring
to a homosexual act,

164
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:21,172
which was the molestation,

165
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,805
taking the rights
of another person away from him.

166
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:29,587
So you want we leave the direct text
and accept some human being's opinion?

167
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:34,456
To play with semantics and say
that this is, you know, "molestation."

168
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,289
I mean, you are just playing
with words.

169
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:41,361
Homosexuality is a crime not only
in Islam, in every divine religion,

170
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:43,731
and is punishable in Islam by death.

171
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,266
And we say if we're an Islamic state,

172
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:49,466
then you would face
capital punishment.

173
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:53,636
The only difference among the jurists
is how that person should be killed.

174
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:55,077
That's the only difference.

175
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:58,483
And I gave you the <i>Hadith</i>
of the Prophet,

176
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:02,714
peace be upon Him, the <i>saying:</i>
"Kill the doer and the receiver."

177
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:26,041
I am Mazen, an Egyptian gay man.

178
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:31,282
I was arrested
in the case of the "Oairo 52."

179
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:34,217
It was in 2001.

180
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,552
I was going with a friend
to a disco.

181
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:41,422
We went to the "Queen Boat."

182
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:46,993
While waiting outside,
we saw some policemen.

183
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:51,365
They put us in a police van.

184
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,675
They took us to Abdeen police station,

185
00:14:56,776 --> 00:15:02,043
to a very weird place,
the vice squad headquarters.

186
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:11,782
Then they started interrogating us
and saying very strange things.

187
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:15,793
They said, "You are faggots,"
and things like that.

188
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:18,523
Anyone who denied it was beaten.

189
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:23,966
I myself was beaten
with pipes and belts

190
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,767
to force me to say, "I am a faggot,"

191
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:32,769
until the case went to trial.

192
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,022
I spent a year in prison.

193
00:15:55,034 --> 00:16:01,769
I was raped in prison.
It was extremely traumatic.

194
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:05,600
It hurts even to talk about it.

195
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:10,506
It is really hard to be forced
to do something against your will.

196
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:14,476
Then we were put on trial
a second time.

197
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:18,956
I was sentenced to 3 years.

198
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:46,883
I was able to get out of Egypt,
to run away from 3 years in prison.

199
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:53,691
As we say in English,
"Enough is enough."

200
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:58,321
Today I'm ready to reveal my face.

201
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:28,752
Look, the fucking asshole,

202
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:30,692
he's talking,
and we don't hear anything,

203
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:34,254
we don't understand anything
of what he said.

204
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:51,407
I'm sure God has a reason
for all that has happened to me.

205
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:56,614
I know that He is always with me,
always by my side.

206
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:02,287
I have this <i>Qur'an,</i>
which I always kept with me in prison.

207
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:08,698
I always prayed
and read it every night.

208
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:14,171
And ever since,
I have kept it close to me.

209
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:21,479
God has given me patience.

210
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,246
He helped me overcome
the calamity I was in.

211
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:36,185
I got out of Egypt
and made it to France.

212
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:42,159
In Paris,
I was granted refugee status.

213
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:51,002
I had no money, no job.
I had no place to stay, no home.

214
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:56,979
For the last 3 years,
I've been staying with friends.

215
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,377
Now, finally, I've found an apartment.

216
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,316
This is my new home.

217
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:11,328
It's a happy day.

218
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:22,470
I can't wait to tell this good news
to my mother.

219
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,273
Hello, my love.

220
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:32,248
- <i>Hi, Darling. How are you doing?</i>
- Good morning. How are you?

221
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:34,285
I have good news on this
Prophet's Birthday celebration!

222
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:37,014
- <i>What is it?</i>
- I got my own apartment!

223
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:37,952
<i>Really?</i>

224
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:43,757
They just accepted
my application today.

225
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:45,922
- <i>Swear by the Prophet?</i>
- By God's name!

226
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:49,262
<i>It's the parents' blessing.</i>
<i>May God be with you.</i>

227
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:53,099
It came
as a Prophet's Birthday blessing.

228
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:55,503
They just called to tell me.

229
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:56,597
<i>Thank God.</i>

230
00:19:56,709 --> 00:20:00,509
Do you want me to send you
some chocolate?

231
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:04,208
- <i>Do you need anything?</i>
- Only your good health.

232
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:07,752
- May all your days be prosperous.
- <i>And all yours, too.</i>

233
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:13,223
- There is no god but God.
- <i>And Muhammad is His Prophet.</i>

234
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:45,954
It's the Eid prayer.

235
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:50,995
We've prayed, and it's good.
<i>Ramadan</i> is over.

236
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:00,505
How much for one of these?

237
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:03,200
One euro and 30 cents?
Isn't that a little expensive?

238
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:05,300
It's Algerian pastry, sir.

239
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:10,881
I'd like two of those.

240
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,587
It's Eid,
and I got my apartment, <i>so...</i>

241
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,785
Tonight is a double celebration.

242
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:23,758
Happy Eid!

243
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:35,832
- Let's toast to Mazen's new apartment.
- Oongratulations!

244
00:21:35,941 --> 00:21:40,037
- A thousand congratulations!
- Thanks.

245
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:41,203
There's no alcohol in them.

246
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,110
I hear <i>Ramadan</i> in Egypt is great.

247
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:46,013
Egypt is the best Arab country
for feeling the spirit of <i>Ramadan.</i>

248
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:48,552
After breaking the fast,
people pray the <i>Taraweeh</i>

249
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:51,851
and go out to smoke hookahs.

250
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:54,323
All the cafes are packed.

251
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:56,087
It's really lively.

252
00:21:56,195 --> 00:22:02,725
They hang paper lanterns everywhere.

253
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:06,532
The best part is when the <i>Misaharaty</i>
passes by at 3:00 a.m.

254
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,231
To wake people up.

255
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,776
Wake up, you who are sleeping!
Speak of the One, Everlasting God.

256
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:13,504
<i>Ramadan</i> is generous.

257
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:17,176
I love it. I miss it.

258
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:20,816
I want to show you
something I did in Morocco.

259
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,719
I was interviewed for a magazine.

260
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:27,883
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

261
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:34,091
The first-ever interview with a young
"sexual deviant" Moroccan writer.

262
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:37,896
I said it all.

263
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:40,028
Everything, I think.

264
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:45,571
The whole family bought it,
and my mother called me on the phone.

265
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:47,145
It was huge.

266
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:48,474
How did she react?

267
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,540
She was less upset
about my being gay

268
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:58,851
than my saying I'm against marriage.

269
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:17,237
Put this on your neck, sweetheart.

270
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:19,867
No, no I'm fine.
It's good.

271
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:21,468
Oome on, darling.
They're diamonds.

272
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,411
Yeah, right.

273
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,983
I'm known for dancing as a man.

274
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:29,413
Everyone has their own style.

275
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,724
<i>Darling, I'm not free for you</i>

276
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:12,990
<i>Nor am I free for passion</i>

277
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:15,328
<i>I'll be free after I come to you</i>

278
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,493
<i>I have something to tell you</i>

279
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:20,003
<i>Darling, I'm not free for you</i>

280
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:22,300
<i>Nor am I free for passion</i>

281
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:24,432
<i>I'll be free after I come to you</i>

282
00:24:24,543 --> 00:24:26,670
<i>I have something to tell you</i>

283
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:28,974
<i>Let us be apart for a while</i>

284
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:31,242
<i>Maybe I can forget the bad days</i>

285
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,750
<i>Let us, let us, let us</i>

286
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:36,116
<i>Maybe I can forget the bad days</i>

287
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:38,280
<i>But what you've done to me</i>

288
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,858
<i>Is too much, my love</i>

289
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:20,353
When I face God [on Judgment Day],
first I will say,

290
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:23,764
"There is no god but God,
and Muhammad is His prophet."

291
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:30,541
Second, I will say, "God, I love You
as much as You love Your creations."

292
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:37,641
Third, "I have loved women,
and it was not a <i>sin...</i>

293
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:46,555
...because my loving a woman
caused no harm.

294
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:49,957
I only loved.

295
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:54,294
Allah, my only God, I only loved."

296
00:25:57,002 --> 00:26:02,235
In my country, they practice
female genital mutilation.

297
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:07,277
Until I was 25 years old,
I was completely closed up.

298
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:11,315
I could not have
normal sexual relations.

299
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,280
This was done in the name
of tradition, in the name of religion.

300
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:17,980
But it's nonsense.

301
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:27,822
God Almighty says,
"We created you in the best of forms."

302
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:36,734
We have no right, if we are truly
Muslims, to alter His creation.

303
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:43,448
Don't forget, the Prophet Muhammad
did an enormous number of things

304
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:47,075
so that women could participate
in public affairs, including politics.

305
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,788
For me, Muhammad was a feminist.

306
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:04,292
I don't think there is a problem
between homosexuality and Islam.

307
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:08,872
If we know that God is benevolent,
merciful, and great,

308
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:14,708
then God must have created us
this way.

309
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:18,872
I know, but it's <i>Haram</i> [sinful].

310
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:23,421
That's what Islam says.
I'm Muslim. I can't contradict it.

311
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:26,650
I believe in the mercy of God,
but that's different.

312
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:30,421
In <i>Shari'a</i> law,
homosexuality is forbidden.

313
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:33,498
- No, it's not. Where is it written?
- It's well-known.

314
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:37,090
- Have you read the <i>Qur'an?</i>
- Have I read the <i>Qur'an?</i>

315
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:39,261
You think there is lesbianism
in the <i>Qur'an?</i>

316
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:41,430
Not lesbianism,
but male homosexuality.

317
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:47,536
How can you say it's <i>Haram?</i>
Based on what?

318
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:51,912
It's based on the Quranic text,
the story of Lot.

319
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:53,075
Go and read the <i>Qur'an</i> again.

320
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:57,519
I'm not an expert on the <i>Qur'an.</i>

321
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,681
But I understand a few things.

322
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:02,692
I still have many doubts.
I can't give you an answer right now.

323
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:04,386
I feel things in my heart.

324
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:06,589
I feel bad sometimes,
that's all I know.

325
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,260
What is this?

326
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:15,068
It's a gift my girlfriend gave me
the first time we met.

327
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:18,631
It says, "There is no god but God,"

328
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:22,976
and she has the other half,
exactly the same.

329
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,015
It's love!

330
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:28,684
And yet you say it's <i>Haram.</i>
It breaks my heart!

331
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:32,814
Love is something powerful.
It's different.

332
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:36,416
To me, love is more important
than sex.

333
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,120
Yes, but that's love with a woman.

334
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,199
Yes, with a woman.

335
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:52,241
When I was 17, I succeeded,
by God's grace,

336
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:53,436
in choosing the path of religion.

337
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:58,744
But starting around the age of 24,
I had no <i>choice...</i>

338
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:03,116
Eventually, I understood
that I needed the love of a woman.

339
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:22,673
Later, I met a woman,
a Muslim woman like myself,

340
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:25,538
in her country, far from here.

341
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:30,013
It's been like this for 3 years,
going back and forth to Egypt,

342
00:29:30,115 --> 00:29:33,915
trying to find a way to live together.

343
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:38,479
But at the same time, deep down,
I'm afraid to live with her.

344
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,890
Ice cream! Oold drinks! Ice cream!
Oold drinks! Oold water! Ice cream!

345
00:30:17,996 --> 00:30:20,863
Fanta! Sprite! Oola Lite! Iced Tea!
Ohocolate! Vanilla! Strawberry!

346
00:30:20,966 --> 00:30:22,991
Drinks! Ice Oream! Oold drinks!
Oold water! Ice cream!

347
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:24,864
Always a good price!

348
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,494
Welcome to Oairo.

349
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:30,237
Maybe I'll go live in a monastery.

350
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:33,433
That hurts.

351
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:37,241
- Maybe that would help me.
- I won't let you do that.

352
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:40,943
We're going to live
through this test together.

353
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:49,087
Why can't we be together
and, at the same time, live with God?

354
00:30:49,194 --> 00:30:53,221
I don't know if it's possible.
I don't know.

355
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:55,595
Maybe, God willing.

356
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:59,996
Frankly, if I could be heterosexual,

357
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:02,266
I would live within a marriage,
but I can't.

358
00:31:02,374 --> 00:31:08,313
Same for me. At first, I went
to "IslamOnline." You know it?

359
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:10,005
I've heard of that site.

360
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:12,582
It's a site of the Muslim Brotherhood.

361
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:16,745
For years,
I sent them e-mails, asking,

362
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:22,657
"What should I do? I'm afraid of God,
and I can't stay like this."

363
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:27,130
Lmmediately, their solution was,
"You have to get married."

364
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:34,370
My whole family, and everyone else,
wanted me to get married.

365
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:37,464
The family pressure
was overwhelming,

366
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:42,445
and I was very weak at that time.

367
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:48,446
I tried. I tried, at first.

368
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:54,651
I asked God to make me normal,
to make me like everyone else,

369
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:58,627
to get rid of this, or die.

370
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,689
It was very hard on both of us.

371
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:06,532
I was exhausted.
It was a nightmare.

372
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:10,338
It was a miracle I got a divorce.

373
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,575
Maybe because I'm a lesbian,

374
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:16,579
I never wanted
to look seductive to men.

375
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:19,548
Even before I started
wearing the veil,

376
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:24,987
I dressed and behaved modestly.

377
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:32,219
People think that a woman who wears
the <i>hijab</i> is closed-minded, extremist.

378
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,390
But I feel really free.

379
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:05,327
I think all Muslims dream of going
on the <i>Hajj</i> pilgrimage some day.

380
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,695
It's hard when you're a single woman

381
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,295
because you have to be accompanied
by your husband, brother, or father.

382
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:19,810
Spiritually, I think it would
help us enormously

383
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:22,641
and also to help us
stop having intimate relations.

384
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:25,739
Maybe it would help <i>us...</i>

385
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,387
<i>"Fiqh al-Sunnah"?</i>

386
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:36,983
It's a reference book for all Muslims.

387
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:40,087
I looked in this book 3 years ago.

388
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:44,897
I thought I would try
to find a solution for myself.

389
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:53,604
I found only a few lines about "us."

390
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:56,236
There it <i>is... al-Suhaq</i> [lesbianism].

391
00:33:56,348 --> 00:34:02,082
"Lesbianism is <i>forbidden...</i>

392
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:06,021
...according to all scholars."

393
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:11,084
Here, they give a definition
of <i>lesbianism:</i>

394
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:15,997
"Lovemaking between two <i>women...</i>

395
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:19,559
...without penetration."

396
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:23,937
The only punishment
is scolding the women.

397
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:30,070
When there's no penetration,
there is no severe punishment.

398
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:31,910
I want to be punished.

399
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:36,583
There is no punishment, you see?
There isn't any.

400
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:40,624
So why do I suffer inside
and feel guilty?

401
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:43,489
You'll feel better if you're punished?

402
00:34:43,595 --> 00:34:46,496
You know,
the punishment of fornicators

403
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:49,396
who are lashed,
I don't know how many times.

404
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:52,698
Don't be so hard on yourself, Maryam.

405
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:56,934
Maybe that would relieve me.
I don't know.

406
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:19,890
<i>Ashura</i> has a very special feeling,
a feeling of love.

407
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:23,595
I'm willing to protect
his [lmam Hossein's] honor.

408
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:27,865
With faith,
I'm willing to sacrifice my life

409
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:32,272
for lmam Hossein,
the greatest of all the martyrs.

410
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:15,581
I was 4 when my father died
in the Iran-lraq war

411
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,554
from a mustard gas attack.

412
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:28,022
In August 2004, a friend
invited me to a gay party.

413
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:33,894
We were raided,
and they put us in jail.

414
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,167
The police said, "You're the son
of a martyr, and you do these things?"

415
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:42,404
To them, I had disgraced
my father's name.

416
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:44,742
The judge said,

417
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:49,548
"The physician will find out whether
or not you are gay."

418
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:53,283
He told us we could be
stoned to death.

419
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:56,087
I was terrified.

420
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:08,269
I received 100 lashes in an hour.

421
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:20,918
My mother was notified
that I was lashed.

422
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:29,051
When I took off my shirt, she cried.

423
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:37,630
Because of her, I left.

424
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:46,972
I didn't want her to suffer
and see my pain anymore.

425
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:54,245
She held the <i>Qur'an</i> over my head
for protection before I left.

426
00:37:54,352 --> 00:38:02,760
I think I will remember that
until my very last breath.

427
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:11,493
But there is someone that
is with me every step, helping me,

428
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:15,334
and that's my God.

429
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:20,803
I remember on the way
from Shiraz to Tehran,

430
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:26,644
I recited the <i>Ayat ul-Kursi</i>
for my mother's protection.

431
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:35,492
<i>God: There is no god but He,</i>
<i>the living, eternal, ever-sustaining</i>

432
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:41,122
<i>Neither slumber nor sleep affect Him</i>

433
00:38:41,232 --> 00:38:46,295
<i>To Him belongs all that is</i>
<i>in the heavens and the earth:</i>

434
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:59,576
<i>Oh Iran, our precious land</i>

435
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:06,021
<i>Your soil is the source of art</i>

436
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:12,359
<i>May thoughts of disaster</i>
<i>be far from you</i>

437
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:18,060
<i>Oh, Iran, be immortal and steadfast</i>

438
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:25,735
It's very hard to describe
the situation for homosexuals in Iran.

439
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,103
It's like a person who wants to speak,

440
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:34,014
but when he opens his mouth,
the words are caught in the throat.

441
00:39:34,118 --> 00:39:42,150
His cry has been suppressed.
It's a heavy silence.

442
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:48,261
From our city of Shiraz,
we traveled to Tehran.

443
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:55,636
Then from Tehran to Tabriz by bus,
and from Tabriz to Turkey by train.

444
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,573
We stopped in Ankara first,

445
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:02,237
where we applied for asylum to the
UN High Oommissioner for Refugees.

446
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:05,382
For now, we are stuck here in Turkey.

447
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:31,740
Hey, what time is it?

448
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:39,146
Good morning, Auntie.

449
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:46,049
Where have you been?

450
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:51,789
I bought <i>aash, halim,</i> and fresh
<i>sangak</i> bread. It's all ready.

451
00:40:52,563 --> 00:41:00,629
Even though we left Iran,
we still don't feel safe.

452
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:11,070
Arsham and I wish Amir and Mojtaba
weren't afraid to show their faces.

453
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:15,652
Fear has followed us
from Iran to Turkey.

454
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:20,747
They're afraid
for their families' safety.

455
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:26,926
I don't want to show my face

456
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:30,592
because my mother and my family
still live in Iran.

457
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:35,331
I'm really afraid
that it will bring them trouble.

458
00:41:36,307 --> 00:41:43,941
My life is Iran.
I miss everything.

459
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:47,845
I left to save my life.

460
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:54,253
Turkey doesn't grant resident status
to Iranian refugees.

461
00:41:54,625 --> 00:42:01,963
We're only allowed to stay
until the UNHOR decides our cases.

462
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:04,159
If we win our cases,
we have to leave Turkey.

463
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:07,669
If we lose, we're sent back to Iran.

464
00:42:07,905 --> 00:42:10,772
- Tell our fortunes.
- Everyone, make a wish.

465
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:12,871
What's your wish?

466
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:15,069
My wish is to be accepted.

467
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:16,908
You wish for UN approval.

468
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:18,606
A wish for today.

469
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:21,776
I wish that no gay person
in the world would be executed.

470
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:24,651
Too general.
It's impossible.

471
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:28,384
Well, the readings
usually turn out wrong.

472
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:31,325
Okay, will the UNHOR call us today?

473
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:34,363
We'll do a reading about the UNHOR.

474
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:40,500
When I used to go to the shrines
of Hafiz, Sa'adi, or others,

475
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:43,073
I would think a lot
about those great poets of Iran.

476
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:45,938
Even then, they talked so much

477
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:51,208
about love and passion,
lovers and men.

478
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:58,320
Everywhere you look among
the richness of Persian literature,

479
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:01,949
the lover and the beloved
are both men,

480
00:43:02,093 --> 00:43:06,621
yet you see that now
it is such a crime.

481
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:15,300
In 2005, Mojtaba held
a wedding ceremony in Shiraz

482
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:18,034
with a man named Mehrdad.

483
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,913
Mehrdad and I were boyfriends
for 6 years.

484
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:28,076
The only person I truly
fell in love with.

485
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:31,620
He was my first introduction to love.

486
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:52,171
What was your wedding like?

487
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:54,938
At first, we planned a casual party,

488
00:43:55,146 --> 00:43:59,913
then Mehrdad suggested
that we buy wedding rings.

489
00:44:00,017 --> 00:44:03,976
What do you think
Mehrdad is doing now?

490
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:06,851
He's doing okay. Don't worry.

491
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:08,918
What was on the table?

492
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:14,555
<i>Everything:</i> the mirror, the candles,
the <i>Qur'an,</i> nuts, sweets.

493
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:15,723
It was perfect.

494
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:24,197
They even had those sweet noghl,
the kind you have at "real" weddings.

495
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:27,641
They brought a special knife

496
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:32,507
and asked us to cut the cake
for each other.

497
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:34,952
That was it. Before we knew it,
the wedding was over.

498
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:36,610
How wonderful!

499
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:40,885
I just don't get it.
Why don't people understand this?

500
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:45,224
Why do they think the sky has to be
the same color for everyone?

501
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,725
Anyway, they filmed the ceremony.

502
00:44:52,169 --> 00:44:56,071
People began seeing the video,
and I think that's how word spread

503
00:44:56,173 --> 00:45:03,341
that such a ceremony
had taken place in Shiraz.

504
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:11,246
Now that they have me on film,
they have all the proof they need.

505
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:25,398
Unfortunately, the police
seized the wedding video,

506
00:45:25,536 --> 00:45:29,063
so Mojtaba doesn't have any way
to prove to the UN

507
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:31,664
what happened to him.

508
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,913
Do you have the video of my wedding?

509
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:42,747
Who has it?

510
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:46,016
If you find it, can you send it to me?

511
00:45:46,424 --> 00:45:48,358
I have to call my mother now.

512
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:51,690
I haven't called home
in a really long time.

513
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,622
I'm still in Turkey.

514
00:45:55,733 --> 00:45:58,133
I haven't left for Oanada yet.

515
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:02,003
Are you crying?

516
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:05,132
I didn't call so you would cry.

517
00:46:09,814 --> 00:46:12,544
I wanted to give you the latest news.

518
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,175
They <i>said...</i>

519
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:23,157
They said we'll be leaving here
in a month.

520
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:29,396
Wherever I am,
you are always with me.

521
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,164
In Turkey or Iran,
no matter where I am, I love you.

522
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:40,699
God be with you.
Give me a kiss.

523
00:46:48,185 --> 00:46:51,677
Don't cry! Don't cry!

524
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:56,249
She said she was cutting onions,
but I could tell she was crying.

525
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,920
Oome on, don't be sad.

526
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:01,264
Orying isn't bad.
It's good for you.

527
00:47:01,398 --> 00:47:03,491
This will make a man out of you.

528
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:05,569
Who says he has to be a man?

529
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:06,966
Oome on, give me a kiss.

530
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:09,596
See, he's just like a mother.

531
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:12,801
I'll be your mother.

532
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,969
If only you could.

533
00:47:15,379 --> 00:47:16,971
I'm a lot of people's mother.

534
00:47:17,081 --> 00:47:19,447
But not mine.

535
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,075
Well, you didn't fill out
the right forms.

536
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:35,661
Waiting is very hard.

537
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:43,195
For me to tolerate this hardship,
I talk to God.

538
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:48,035
At this point we're waiting
for any help we can get,

539
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:51,080
but I think
we'll have to wait forever.

540
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:55,881
- Read it faster. You're too slow.
- Well, I'm reading carefully.

541
00:47:57,254 --> 00:48:02,089
There is someone
who really loves you.

542
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:04,285
It's a man.

543
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:06,192
Oh, Sweetheart!

544
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:10,061
Well, I see you lying down
with both your legs in the air.

545
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:15,234
I'm serious! Look here!

546
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:18,632
See, here's one leg,
and there's the other.

547
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:19,766
That's the <i>head...</i>

548
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:21,936
Let me see it!

549
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:24,544
I see an airplane.
You are going to fly.

550
00:48:24,648 --> 00:48:25,478
Let me see.

551
00:48:25,683 --> 00:48:28,311
No, it's a car in the air,
not a plane.

552
00:48:28,419 --> 00:48:29,818
He's right!

553
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,798
Islam and homosexuality
do not merge very well.

554
00:48:46,937 --> 00:48:50,600
Islam has a big problem
acknowledging homosexuality.

555
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:54,106
It will take a <i>Jihad</i>

556
00:48:55,346 --> 00:49:02,377
and probably longer
than my own lifetime.

557
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:53,062
God says, "I created you
from My love and My own image."

558
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:57,139
Whatever I am, God is.

559
00:49:57,241 --> 00:50:01,041
Whatever I feel,
God wants me to feel.

560
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:04,979
Anything that's humane
and doesn't harm others

561
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:12,921
and doesn't attack anyone's rights
or honor cannot be a sin.

562
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:19,662
Why don't we get any treats?

563
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:21,560
There are other treats for you!

564
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:24,691
What kind of treats?

565
00:50:27,404 --> 00:50:30,430
My atheist friends always ask me,

566
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:35,543
"How can you be a lesbian
and have such religious faith?"

567
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:37,307
For me, each has its own place.

568
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:41,407
If God has planted this love
in my heart, then it is legitimate.

569
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:59,030
No. No.

570
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:03,935
This is too much, outside the mosque!

571
00:51:10,347 --> 00:51:13,783
But you can kiss me.

572
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:18,685
Okay, I give in.
Let's fly like butterflies!

573
00:51:31,435 --> 00:51:34,427
Sister, can the men go upstairs
this way?

574
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:35,527
No, you can't.

575
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:38,567
If you all move aside,
the men can go upstairs.

576
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:40,643
Let them pass, let them pass.

577
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:43,076
We'll go upstairs,
if you'll excuse us.

578
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,512
Oome on, brothers.

579
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:14,741
Dear respectable <i>Muslims:</i>

580
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:20,544
Our great religion Islam gave us
important moral principles.

581
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:25,486
One of these principles
is the love of human beings.

582
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:35,997
Love itself is the foundation
of human relationships

583
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:42,834
and a critical part of improving
and strengthening society.

584
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,500
In the words of Mevlana <i>Rumi:</i>

585
00:52:45,642 --> 00:52:53,344
"Love transforms bitter to sweet,
copper to gold, sickness to health.

586
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:58,217
A dungeon to a palace,
troubles to blessings,

587
00:52:58,355 --> 00:53:01,847
and suffering to God's mercy."

588
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:05,953
I was forced to get married
at an early age.

589
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:08,190
I had just turned 16.

590
00:53:08,298 --> 00:53:10,960
I was married for 6 weeks
when we went to see a doctor,

591
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:14,629
and the doctor told my mother
this was absurd.

592
00:53:14,738 --> 00:53:18,196
He said, "This girl's organs are not
developed enough to give birth.

593
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:20,242
If she gets pregnant,
there will be problems."

594
00:53:20,344 --> 00:53:23,404
But nobody listened,
and I got pregnant.

595
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:30,352
It was very hard.
Pain, pain, constant pain.

596
00:53:32,422 --> 00:53:38,327
Women like us are captives
in another life. We are prisoners.

597
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:43,491
For example, there are girls
in the Southeast and in remote areas

598
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,969
who are lesbians
but cannot lead lesbian lives.

599
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:51,134
At least, I'm not
in the same situation as they are.

600
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:53,471
I thank God for that.

601
00:53:57,247 --> 00:54:00,375
Now that we're on our way,
I'm <i>starting...</i>

602
00:54:00,484 --> 00:54:03,715
To feel nervous? I don't believe it.

603
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,618
Sometimes I hide my feelings,
but now I'm really nervous.

604
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,380
My mother will comfort you.

605
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:12,451
God willing. I wonder how she'll
greet me, what she'll think of me.

606
00:54:12,563 --> 00:54:15,464
- Do I look very pink?
- No, it's very nice.

607
00:54:15,566 --> 00:54:17,227
Sugar pink.

608
00:54:31,014 --> 00:54:33,812
Mother, meet Kiymet.

609
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:36,283
Welcome!

610
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:41,016
The war of the eyeglasses.

611
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:50,697
People say Ferda and I look alike,
but I can't see any similarity.

612
00:54:51,435 --> 00:54:55,929
I wasn't like her in my youth.
When I was Ferda's age, I was stylish.

613
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:58,269
And now, look at you!

614
00:55:01,211 --> 00:55:03,771
You were so naughty.
Do you think you were well-behaved?

615
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,849
- I don't think I was naughty.
- Were you some nice house girl?

616
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:08,713
No, never in my life
have I been a nice house girl.

617
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:11,549
You were a street kitty!

618
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:14,852
She calls me a street kitty!

619
00:55:16,793 --> 00:55:18,021
- She is putting on a show.
- What's her name?

620
00:55:18,128 --> 00:55:20,062
- Lora.
- Lora.

621
00:55:20,163 --> 00:55:22,597
Lora, do you want to come out?

622
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:24,261
Girl, Sweetie.

623
00:55:24,668 --> 00:55:27,501
- Is it a "she"?
- Yes, <i>but...</i>

624
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:31,335
<i>...she</i> hasn't laid any eggs
in 19 years.

625
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:32,931
Why?

626
00:55:33,043 --> 00:55:36,240
She's very picky.
She doesn't like any other birds.

627
00:55:37,014 --> 00:55:41,383
Hey, girl,
shall I bring you another girl?

628
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:42,309
What?

629
00:55:42,419 --> 00:55:45,013
Maybe she wants a girl!

630
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,151
She says maybe the parrot
wants a girl.

631
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:50,692
Maybe you should give it a try.

632
00:55:50,794 --> 00:55:53,661
Maybe she's a homosexual?

633
00:55:54,264 --> 00:55:56,698
Oould very well be.

634
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,997
Now it's the fashion.

635
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:02,161
Bye-bye.

636
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:10,037
Perfect!

637
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:11,341
- Is that what you think?
- Yes.

638
00:56:11,448 --> 00:56:13,507
That's what I think. Perfect.

639
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:15,642
Thank you.

640
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,703
Islam is a religion of peace,

641
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:44,607
but we can only understand this
by understanding Sufism,

642
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:49,242
not by how some people
interpret Islam.

643
00:57:41,905 --> 00:57:45,932
- So you want two of these?
- Yes, two.

644
00:58:32,589 --> 00:58:35,956
The hand above
is the one that receives.

645
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:39,389
The hand below is the one that gives.

646
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:44,056
For me, it represents the circle,
coming from the Oreator,

647
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:49,400
going back to the earth
and returning to the Oreator again.

648
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:32,542
Books and history tell us
that Madho Lal was born a Hindu,

649
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:35,277
but we mystics
are indifferent to that.

650
00:59:35,585 --> 00:59:40,181
Madho becoming a Muslim
was ordained by God,

651
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:45,728
and so was his eternal love
for Shah Husain.

652
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:49,321
They became lovers.

653
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:07,044
They gave each other so much love
that today,

654
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:11,109
when the world pays its respects
to Shah Husain,

655
01:00:11,221 --> 01:00:13,621
they also pay respects to Madho Lal.

656
01:00:29,906 --> 01:00:33,171
God has requested this noise
and festivity

657
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:36,439
so we have ordered
the drummers to beat their drums

658
01:00:36,546 --> 01:00:39,515
until we hear the sounds
of <i>"Allah-hu."</i>

659
01:01:29,866 --> 01:01:33,358
No one explains clearly,
so "this" never leaves the heart.

660
01:01:33,703 --> 01:01:36,501
I have faith in God
and also love "this thing."

661
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:40,167
I want to live my life carrying both.

662
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:43,941
I want to find out
if both are permitted or not.

663
01:01:48,818 --> 01:01:54,222
I have come here to find out
about my loving men.

664
01:01:54,657 --> 01:01:58,650
I want to know if Islam
has room for "this."

665
01:02:00,463 --> 01:02:06,402
Ever since I heard
that Islam forbids homosexuality,

666
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,200
I've felt a barrier
between the two of them.

667
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:11,865
But I really like both
homosexuality and Islam.

668
01:02:11,975 --> 01:02:15,240
No, this is absolutely unnatural.

669
01:02:15,345 --> 01:02:23,480
Nature and God have made
men and women for each other.

670
01:02:23,586 --> 01:02:26,987
Men are not for men
and women are not for women.

671
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:31,417
I've been attracted to boys
from the beginning.

672
01:02:31,528 --> 01:02:33,155
What should I do?

673
01:02:33,263 --> 01:02:36,426
Please read
all the teachings of Islam.

674
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:41,470
Read the <i>Qur'an</i>
and pray for God's blessings.

675
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,569
This unnatural tendency you were
born with will go away if God wishes.

676
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:49,536
No matter how big the crime,

677
01:02:49,646 --> 01:02:52,444
if you seek forgiveness
at God's doorstep,

678
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:55,017
you don't need forgiveness
from mortals at all.

679
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:57,951
- Lf I pray, then will God forgive me?
- Absolutely.

680
01:02:58,054 --> 01:03:03,754
If the One above forgives you, then
the world has no right to judge you.

681
01:03:04,227 --> 01:03:11,633
Punishment is given only when there is
no hope of resolving the issue.

682
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:14,060
And what if I stop doing "this,"

683
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,900
but I continue to like boys
and not girls?

684
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:21,375
Then this is some kind
of psychological problem.

685
01:03:21,478 --> 01:03:24,379
You should talk to a psychologist

686
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:28,542
because this problem you are talking
about shows that you have a disease.

687
01:03:28,952 --> 01:03:34,254
God willing, he will be able
to cure your problem.

688
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:37,516
So may I come to you
whenever I want?

689
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:41,488
Yes, absolutely. You can come
whenever you have a problem.

690
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:46,100
Sometimes I feel that I'm wrong,

691
01:03:46,202 --> 01:03:48,602
and sometimes I feel
God created me this way.

692
01:03:48,872 --> 01:03:51,636
God is the all-knowing.

693
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:59,282
He created me in the Muslim "caste."
I can't choose to be another way.

694
01:04:04,387 --> 01:04:08,824
Once, when I was sitting near
the big mosque, a <i>Maulana</i> came by.

695
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:12,422
I asked him
why homosexuality is forbidden.

696
01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:17,262
He just said, "It's forbidden,
and the earth will split open."

697
01:04:17,367 --> 01:04:20,268
He didn't explain it well.

698
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,668
Then he asked me to go with him.

699
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:24,467
I said, "You just told me
it's forbidden."

700
01:04:24,574 --> 01:04:27,236
He said, "Never mind that.
Oome with me."

701
01:04:27,343 --> 01:04:30,176
Then he kissed me on the cheek.

702
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:36,651
I can't clap right.
How do you do it?

703
01:04:36,753 --> 01:04:38,983
You go like this,
and then hit them like this.

704
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:50,227
Some people call it <i>geela,</i>
<i>gandu,</i> or <i>chakka.</i>

705
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:54,099
Using those names insults people
that society already demeans.

706
01:04:54,204 --> 01:04:57,105
I call myself <i>koti</i> with pride.

707
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:06,271
Swinging our hips, talking to
other <i>kotis</i> and going off with boys,

708
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:08,646
we do these things secretly.

709
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:13,552
Humans make mistakes all the time.

710
01:05:13,656 --> 01:05:15,283
The only mistake God could make

711
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:18,383
would be to give a man
the heart of a woman.

712
01:05:22,432 --> 01:05:26,926
I used to wear a skirt, blouse,
long hair, earrings, everything.

713
01:05:27,237 --> 01:05:28,602
After I performed the <i>Hajj,</i>

714
01:05:28,705 --> 01:05:33,870
I realized I could no longer
disgrace my religion.

715
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:38,306
From that day on,

716
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:42,145
I stopped acting like a woman
or wearing women's clothes

717
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:44,015
or sleeping with men.

718
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:46,845
- So, are you ready to get married?
- Yes, absolutely.

719
01:05:46,956 --> 01:05:49,288
If I want to live in this society,
I have to marry.

720
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:51,587
That's why I do "these things"
in secret.

721
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:01,426
I am illiterate and ignorant.

722
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:04,301
If I had been able to study,

723
01:06:04,474 --> 01:06:06,772
then I would be here
with these students.

724
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:15,682
This is the <i>Nadhwa</i> school
where the religion of Islam is taught.

725
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:20,313
In this place,
I feel very strange about my "crimes."

726
01:06:42,845 --> 01:06:47,179
No one should ever think
that God is not there for them.

727
01:06:48,818 --> 01:06:53,949
He's there for gays, <i>kotis,</i>
prostitutes, everyone.

728
01:07:17,814 --> 01:07:22,410
I am getting a shave today
because we <i>kotis</i> are having a party.

729
01:07:25,388 --> 01:07:28,118
Oh, God, what kind of mother-in-law
is this? She's pulling my hair!

730
01:07:28,624 --> 01:07:30,251
I look better when I'm "plain."

731
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,827
She's looking scary!

732
01:07:31,928 --> 01:07:33,896
Hey, Qasim. Get out.

733
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:37,994
All the men should wait outside.

734
01:07:38,301 --> 01:07:40,098
Go on, get out now.

735
01:07:40,436 --> 01:07:41,425
I'm staying in here with my sisters.

736
01:07:41,537 --> 01:07:44,563
Get out!

737
01:07:44,674 --> 01:07:46,835
Why should I be embarrassed?

738
01:07:58,121 --> 01:08:00,954
<i>You cannot keep your love hidden</i>

739
01:08:01,057 --> 01:08:05,926
<i>In all four directions are spies</i>

740
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:17,665
<i>Since there are no secrets from God</i>

741
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:24,613
<i>Since there are no secrets from God,</i>
<i>why keep secrets from mortals?</i>

742
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:36,854
<i>You only loved, so why be afraid?</i>
<i>If you love, then why be afraid?</i>

743
01:09:06,088 --> 01:09:08,648
- Did you get your ticket?
- Yeah.

744
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:26,798
The day after tomorrow
you won't be here anymore.

745
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:32,046
- I'll be on the plane.
- No, you'll be where you wanted to be.

746
01:09:33,115 --> 01:09:35,982
So how does it feel to be leaving?

747
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:38,485
Sometimes I'm happy.

748
01:09:38,654 --> 01:09:41,054
Sometimes sad.

749
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:43,887
Sometimes I don't know what to feel.

750
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,156
I'm happy.
Happy that the waiting is over.

751
01:09:47,263 --> 01:09:49,026
Were the three years hard or easy?

752
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:50,462
Hard.

753
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:52,124
I'm happy you'll be coming soon, Amir,

754
01:09:52,235 --> 01:09:54,499
but I'm worried that Mojtaba
still hasn't heard from the UN.

755
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:58,665
Hopefully, he will be accepted.

756
01:09:58,808 --> 01:10:00,799
I will miss you, my dear.

757
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,502
No, you won't. I know it.

758
01:10:02,912 --> 01:10:06,439
You were always mad at me.

759
01:10:06,549 --> 01:10:09,245
What is it?

760
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:13,186
Look, now we're crying!

761
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:17,082
Oome on, don't cry so much.

762
01:10:20,796 --> 01:10:22,354
Kiss it.

763
01:10:22,465 --> 01:10:26,333
You should start from the other side.

764
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:28,062
It's okay.

765
01:10:34,844 --> 01:10:38,837
Pray that these suitcases
make it to Toronto.

766
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:22,587
In my faith, they say that if someone
calls out <i>"Ya Allah!"</i> 10 times,

767
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:26,719
God will answer,
"What is it, my child?"

768
01:11:45,448 --> 01:11:48,076
Seven or eight hours until freedom.

769
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:55,115
Do you think they have this in pink?

770
01:11:56,092 --> 01:12:01,189
- You want it in pink?
- Pink is the color for gays.

771
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:18,513
Today is my new birthday.

772
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:23,076
No one is here.
What should we do now?

773
01:12:25,755 --> 01:12:28,690
At the embassy they asked
what I would do when I arrived.

774
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:33,591
I said, "I want to breathe."
So now I can breathe.

775
01:12:38,668 --> 01:12:43,196
I used to think
I would never see this day.

776
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:51,979
I used to think, "How can I be free
when so many others can't?"

777
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:55,109
One day they will also be free.

778
01:13:12,835 --> 01:13:15,030
I am so excited.

779
01:13:15,404 --> 01:13:19,067
I can't wait to get there.
I am bubbling.

780
01:13:20,176 --> 01:13:24,943
Because it's the first time I'm going
to speak to the Muslim community.

781
01:13:26,549 --> 01:13:29,382
The very same community
that asked me to leave

782
01:13:29,485 --> 01:13:32,318
has now asked me to come back

783
01:13:32,421 --> 01:13:35,857
and talk to them about homosexuality,
because it's a dilemma.

784
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,984
They don't know how to deal with it.

785
01:13:39,462 --> 01:13:42,625
Okay. I wish there was a verse
in the <i>Qur'an</i> that said,

786
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:45,758
"Please do not discriminate
against homosexuality."

787
01:13:45,868 --> 01:13:48,666
But, unfortunately,
it's not an easy subject as that.

788
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:51,535
And therefore,
I requested a very open mind.

789
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,438
The <i>Qur'an</i> doesn't speak
about Sodom and Gomorrah.

790
01:13:54,543 --> 01:13:56,408
It speaks about the cities
of the plain.

791
01:13:56,946 --> 01:14:01,315
They were selfish, they used
to do robbery, they used to rape,

792
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:07,014
and send off the men naked,
and they used to set up unjust courts.

793
01:14:07,256 --> 01:14:08,917
And as you can clearly see now,

794
01:14:09,024 --> 01:14:12,516
it is not because of homosexual acts
that Allah has destroyed them,

795
01:14:12,695 --> 01:14:15,823
but they were clearly
a corrupt nation.

796
01:14:15,931 --> 01:14:19,196
The only way two males
can have a sexual relationship

797
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:22,168
is to have anal sex,

798
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:25,502
which is forbidden as far
as the <i>Qur'an</i> is concerned.

799
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:31,103
Not completely. One doesn't
have to have anal sex to have sex.

800
01:14:31,213 --> 01:14:34,444
In terms of showing love
with one another.

801
01:14:35,084 --> 01:14:39,714
But how far? That is what Allah is
trying to help us with in the <i>Qur'an.</i>

802
01:14:39,822 --> 01:14:41,449
How far do we go?

803
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:45,622
You know we are not dependent
on the lmams and the clergy.

804
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:50,061
Each Muslim, man and woman,
they have been commanded

805
01:14:50,166 --> 01:14:52,031
to go and learn for themselves.

806
01:14:52,134 --> 01:14:54,967
They've been commanded
to challenge the status quo.

807
01:14:55,204 --> 01:14:58,571
Islam commands us to learn
from the cradle to the grave.

808
01:14:58,841 --> 01:15:02,333
We have so many clergy,
I always say,

809
01:15:02,444 --> 01:15:06,107
you kick at every bush and you find
a <i>sheikh</i> dropping out.

810
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:09,349
To say that you can be gay or lesbian

811
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:12,682
and still be a good Muslim
and still be Allah-conscious,

812
01:15:12,788 --> 01:15:15,052
and this is what I like
that's happened here today.

813
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:25,958
We cannot find answers
within orthodox Islamic thinking.

814
01:15:26,068 --> 01:15:28,593
We have to use
one of the principles of Islam

815
01:15:28,704 --> 01:15:30,103
that has been lost over the years.

816
01:15:30,206 --> 01:15:33,300
<i>Ljtihad,</i> meaning,
"independent reasoning."

817
01:15:33,409 --> 01:15:36,503
To find a space for us within Islam.

818
01:16:01,003 --> 01:16:04,063
<i>Here I am at Your service, Allah</i>

819
01:16:04,173 --> 01:16:05,936
<i>Here I am</i>

820
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:08,805
<i>Here I am at Your service</i>

821
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:11,607
<i>And You have no equals</i>

822
01:16:12,448 --> 01:16:17,476
I guess what was never taught to us
when we were growing up

823
01:16:17,586 --> 01:16:21,044
is that Allah is also
the Allah of love.

824
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:26,756
We always had to <i>Taqwa Allah,</i>
you have to fear God.

825
01:16:26,862 --> 01:16:29,558
We never were taught
about the love of God.

826
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:35,466
Allah says in the <i>Qur'an,</i>
"Do not despair of the mercy of <i>God...</i>

827
01:16:35,638 --> 01:16:42,066
...because God, to you,
is most merciful."
