6
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,583
'I don't want to die.'

7
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,416
'I cannot die.'

8
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,000
'No. I won't die.'

9
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,666
'Why did I come to a land...ruled by monsters?'

10
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,583
'Opium's grown here.'

11
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:48,083
'And the man that runs this business is Parmar.'

12
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,500
'He runs this business...'

13
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,958
'...with the help of a politician of this area.'

14
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,625
'Parmar has just one enemy.'

15
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,541
'Shivraj Gurjar.'

16
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,250
'Shivraj Gurjar is more devious than Manik Parmar.'

17
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,791
'There's often bloodshed between the two...'

18
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,666
'...for complete control over the business.'

19
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,916
'Both can stoop to any level for their own interest.'

20
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,416
'And this is why the area has turned into hell.'

21
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,416
'And fate brought me to this hell.'

22
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,333
'That night, Shivraj and Parmar's men...'

23
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,166
'...were trying to kill each other.'

24
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:54,166
'And in this village of death, I saw my life.'

25
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,541
So. How's yöur boss Ajit Taka.

26
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,416
Ajit Taka's very furious.

27
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,166
He's not ready to increase the rates of yöur opium.

28
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,208
Please explain him.

29
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,666
yöu're an educated man.

30
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,458
yöu see, inflation is on the rise.

31
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,083
If we don't increase rates...

32
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,708
... we can't survive this inflation...

33
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,875
yöu see, they worked for 5000...

34
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,458
...but now, they demand 20,000.

35
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,208
Does that mean yöu'll increase rates 300%?

36
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,458
Calm down, Sawant sir.

37
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,250
If yöu don't understand, who will?

38
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,166
Take a look at this house.

39
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,541
It's hasn't been repainted for two years.

40
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,041
My grandfather built it with great zest.

41
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:39,208
That is how he looked when he started.

42
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:45,375
And that's how he ended up when he finished.

43
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,875
Why?

44
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,250
New cars are being launched every day.

45
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,041
I've been driving that...

46
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,541
...same car for the last four years.

47
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,041
Why?

48
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:02,291
Even I also want to sing, dance, go sight seeing.

49
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,875
Have blast. What else?

50
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:09,958
What if Ajit Taka refuses?

51
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,625
Brother will sell the stuff himself...

52
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,333
...in international market.

53
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,541
His Rajyoga has started .

54
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,291
Sun and Saturn both are favouring him.

55
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,000
yöu're trying to take a big leap.

56
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,083
yöu can't set foot in the international market, forget selling.

57
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,416
yöu think Taka will let yöu stand.

58
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,875
Taka won't spare yöur life either.

59
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,250
Get that?

60
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,250
Watch it.

61
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,333
What did Shivraj say?

62
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:56,000
'Maybe I won't do too well in the international market

63
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,500
But, if Taka tries to set foot in Dhartipur...

64
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,208
...then I'll burn him...alive.

65
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:15,833
Don't mess with me. I'm injurious to health.

66
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,875
What did Parmar say?

67
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,666
He too has grown a bit audacious after Shivraj.

68
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:26,458
They are such fools.

69
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,208
They grow arrogant with a little power.

70
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,541
A little success makes them...

71
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:39,416
... forget their real place.

72
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,416
It's difficult to convince them, sir.

73
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,208
But, it's easy to confuse them.

74
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,000
How?
- Do yöu want to know everything?

75
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,000
Sorry, sir. I was only asking.

76
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,375
Get up. It's Shivraj sir's truck.

77
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,833
- Sir.
- Lakha. Don't make any mistake.

78
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,666
Kill everyone in the truck.

79
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,666
And confiscate the goods.
- Yes sir.

80
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,166
I guess he's one of Parmar's men.

81
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:43,166
Run over him.

82
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,041
It's so late. Why hasn't the truck arrived yet?

83
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,000
Can I say something?
- Yes.

84
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,708
Why are we waiting for the truck?

85
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,708
We're here to plunder the goods, right?

86
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,541
Come on. We'll go take a look.

87
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:41,083
What happened to the truck?

88
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,583
The goods are missing.

89
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,500
Sir. Someone stole the goods before us.

90
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,250
Have yöu lost yöur mind?

91
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,958
What are yöu saying?

92
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,833
I was shocked too.

93
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,958
Who dared to plunder Shivraj's consignment...

94
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,333
...instead of us?

95
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,375
Don't know, sir.

96
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,958
Find out. Find him.

97
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,958
Otherwise... I will...break yöur limbs.

98
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,291
Bring him to me.

99
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,041
Four! They always bothered the girls.

100
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:44,041
She's a real hard hitter.

101
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:14,708
Great, Chanda.
- Let's go.

102
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,333
Brother. yöur planets and stars...

103
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,625
...are in a favorable position.

104
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,125
No one can harm yöu, let alone steal yöur goods.

105
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,083
Boss.

106
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,250
Come on.

107
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,250
It's him.

108
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,750
He stole our goods.

109
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,416
yöu're so short...and yöu look to take a big leap.

110
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,333
Short sizes often achieve big feats.

111
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,333
What did yöu say?

112
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,833
I was talking about this mosquito?

113
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,291
yöu stole our consignment...

114
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,041
...and now yöu're acting smart with us.

115
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,500
I didn't steal it.

116
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,125
I saved it from Parmar.

117
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,125
yöur stuff is safe. It's behind yöur house.

118
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,375
So...what do yöu want?

119
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,583
The idea is yöu let me work for yöu.

120
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,375
I like yöur idea.

121
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,166
Rascal, I...

122
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,500
What's yöur name?

123
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,875
Rajkumar.

124
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:22,833
Romeo Rajkumar.

125
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:23,875
Majnu.

126
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,875
See if he's really got something.

127
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,333
There yöu go.

128
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,416
Boss!

129
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,958
He's a ham.

130
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,208
Keep him.

131
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:44,250
Get lost.

132
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,500
Rascal.

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,916
yöu're humiliating us for yöur own good.

134
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,708
Watch what I do to yöu now.

135
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,125
yöu oaf. Don't yöu wear underwear?

136
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,125
Have yöu seen oaf's wearing underwear?
- Shut up!

137
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,208
Sir.

138
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,625
I've heard that Shivraj's coming...

139
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,708
...to inaugurate a bar.

140
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,083
Blow him up.

141
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,583
Crush him like a rodent.

142
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,375
Not me. Him!
- Yes, sir.

143
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,666
Come.

144
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,708
Sir, do we blow him up or crush him like a rodent?

145
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,458
Stop blabbering...

146
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,458
Come.

147
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:36,750
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>I'm in love with yöu, God forgive me.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

148
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,208
What a girl?

149
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:43,666
Since I saw her, everything seems beautiful.

150
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,666
yöu too.

151
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,000
It's done.

152
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,250
As soon as his car touches this wire...

153
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,416
...the bomb will explode from both ends.

154
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,666
Can I say something?
- Yes.

155
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,125
He survived the last time.

156
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:12,125
Why not blow up our own car this time?

157
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,375
They're coming.

158
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,500
The car's here.

159
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,083
Let's go.

160
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:24,708
Come on. Run! Run!

161
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,416
It's a lucky day for yöu today.

162
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,083
No one can lay a finger on yöu.

163
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,791
Sun God's blessed yöu with His grace.

164
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,791
Boss, Look behind.

165
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,333
The rascal's trying to kill us.

166
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,333
Come here.

167
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:52,541
yöu...

168
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,541
Where are yöu going?

169
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,125
Look there.

170
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,500
Tell me something.

171
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,791
How did yöu know there's a bomb up ahead?

172
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,833
A bird told me.

173
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,916
That one.

174
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,583
When the cars were moving ahead...

175
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:34,791
...I noticed that bird...

176
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,541
...sitting four inches above the ground, in mid air.

177
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,958
It rang an alarm.

178
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,791
And at the right time too.

179
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,833
From today yöu're my right hand man.

180
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,250
Like I said, boss.

181
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,416
No one can lay a finger on yöu today.

182
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,083
That bird saved yöu.

183
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,125
Look at the violent flames...

184
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,291
...where the bomb exploded.

185
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,166
I've been working relentlessly for 14 years.

186
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,750
And now, yöu'll be his right hand.

187
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,500
14 years?

188
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,458
That's why yöu're always standing.

189
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,458
yöu never sit.

190
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,791
Boss was right.

191
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,541
yöu're a ham.

192
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,541
Don't hit me.

193
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,250

...by the morning train to meet Parmar.

245
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:00,583
Parmar dares to challenge...

246
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:01,875
...only because of Anandraj and Lakha.

247
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,916
If we shatter his supports...

248
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,083
...he will never stand up again.

249
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:10,083
Break them.
- Yes, brother...

250
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:12,916

251
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,166
...then, I'll kill him.

252
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,333

yöu took three days to find Lakha's body alone.

404
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:51,083
They're powerful people, Parmar sir.

405
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:52,916
Like yöu.

406
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:57,250
And yöu know... I'm neither on yöur side...

407
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,166
...nor Shivraj's.

408
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:02,708
I am just a dog...only looking for bones.

409
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,708
I've an idea.

410
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:14,708
Make a compromise with Shivraj.

411
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:18,166
So that he can enjoy killing my men.

412
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,166
And I...stay in mourning and be left alone.

413
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,791
No...

414
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:30,541
If he doesn't compromise, then kill him.

415
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:34,208
And if he's ready to compromise...

416
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:38,208
Still, yöu can kill him.

417
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,500
Fix a meeting.

418
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,041
Parmar. Why call me here?

419
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,750
For a compromise?

420
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,750
yöu killed two of my right hand men.

421
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:15,750
Yes.

422
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,291
Because yöu tried to kill me.

423
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:19,666
There's still time.

424
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,333
Join hands with me.

425
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,583
Otherwise, yöu're next on my list.

426
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:30,000
yöu think I called yöu here for a compromise?

427
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,083
yöu won't leave from here alive.

428
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:37,083
Get that.

429
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,750
Oh my god.

430
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:58,208
yöu said he's bringing 60 men.

431
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:02,541
Just one of my men can deal with them.

432
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,375
Don't be surprised, Mr. Parmar.

433
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,041
yöu paid me.

434
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,041
Sir paid me more.

435
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:10,750
And I am just a dog.

436
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,208
I can do anything for a bone.

437
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:13,666
And yöu know that.

438
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,333
I gave the same idea to Shivraj sir as well.

439
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,083
Rascal.

440
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,416
Not yöu.

441
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,333
yöu go.

442
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:27,333
Rascal...

443
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,000
yöu brought a kid to kill me.

444
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,958
Come on. Come on.

445
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,375
I'll give yöu a piggy back ride.

446
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,833
Parmar!

447
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,458
Be silent...

448
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:49,500
Or else I'll get violent.

449
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,291
Rascals.

450
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:52,333
What are yöu all looking at?

451
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:56,333
Kill him.

452
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:09,875
Move.

453
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:13,875
Boss...it's a fantastic time...

454
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,000
Munna. Where are yöu?

455
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,166
I wanted to meet yöu.

456
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:48,125
yöu can meet Munna at the hospital in half an hour.

457
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,666
Are yöu Munna?

458
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:52,208
Leave the umbrella. What are yöu staring at?

459
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:56,208
Beat him!

460
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:25,583
Well. I'm in yöur arms now.

461
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:29,583
Now, let's go over that side.

462
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,208
Thank God.

463
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,208
What if he had asked him to feed him?

464
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,625
Listen carefully.

465
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:50,625
Shake hands...or die.

466
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,333
One more thing.

467
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,541
Don't mess with me.

468
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:01,541
I am injurious to health.

469
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:05,250
Hey, fool.

470
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,000
Are yöu going to think with me in yöur arms?

471
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,000
Keep me down.

472
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:17,291
Move.

473
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:22,541
It's a deal.
- Its a deal.

474
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,541
Thank yöu.

475
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:31,875
Sir. They're the Russian Mafia.

476
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,375
If they don't get the marijuana on time...

477
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:36,041
...it can create a big problem.

478
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,666
And, this Shivraj and Parmar...

479
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:42,250
...issue is getting worse by the day.

480
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,666
It's difficult to get the stuff from there,

481
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:50,333
We often face tough times.

482
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,000
So, should I shut down business?

483
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,125
No, sir

484
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:57,583
Patience, my friend.

485
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,458
Patience.

486
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,250
Come on.

487
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,125
Let's enjoy.

488
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,833
Ladies and Gentlemen, what am I here for?

489
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,500
Pay attention.

490
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,541
Five years ago, I...

491
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,750
Well, according to yöu which one's bigger?

492
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,541
Stupid.

493
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:22,666
I was asking which is bigger, love or friendship.

494
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,625
Friendship.
- Why?

495
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,000
Love's like an intoxication.

496
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,250
And, yöu need cocaine to stay intoxicated.

497
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,166
But once yöu make a friend...

498
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:34,791
...he always stands by yöu.

499
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,500
But, how do I taste the intoxication of love?

500
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,750
I don't know where my Lollypop is?

501
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,750
We want to uproot it.

502
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,750
My lollypop.

503
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:51,416
What happened?

504
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:53,416
Time to get beaten up again for yöur love.

505
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:55,833
That's not true.
- Of course it is.

506
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,375
Beat them.

507
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:58,083
Can I run?

508
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,666
Run Milkha Run!

509
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,416
They're disrupting my meeting.

510
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:06,416
Burn them all.

511
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:21,000
Look. Seems like someone's inside.

512
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,666
Is there anyone...

513
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:28,666
...who can go in and save that man?

514
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,541
Help!

515
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:41,541
Someone save my old man!

516
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,125
I am inside.

517
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:51,958
But getting out is going to be a real pain...

518
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:54,541
Anybody there?

519
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:58,541
Mister...

520
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,625
I came to save him...

521
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:06,291
...but, who's going to save me?

522
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,708
I haven't even seen the world yet.

523
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:11,333
Anybody there?

524
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:13,416
Anybody there?

525
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:18,125
Anybody there?

526
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:22,125
I risked my life to save this dead body.

527
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,041
Water.

528
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:29,375
Water. Water.

529
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:33,583
Water.
- Water. Water.

530
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:36,541
Ice water.

531
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,958
The house is on fire...

532
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:42,958
...and yöu want ice water.

533
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:48,000
Water.

534
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,000
I'll get it.
- Quickly.

535
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,375
Here yöu go.

536
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:01,625
Last time.

537
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:06,250
Pour the ice water.

538
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,666
Come on. Drink it up.

539
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:10,125
Hurry up.

540
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:13,666
Slow motion. Gulp it down.

541
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:17,166
Now, come on.

542
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:19,041
No, I won't go outside.

543
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:24,875
My wife has made my life hell for the last 50 years.

544
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:26,750
I don't want to go out.

545
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:27,625
I will die right here.

546
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,625
If yöu want to die, then do it outside.

547
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:33,375
Go. Go away.

548
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,791
My wife will kill me.

549
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:39,750
Hail Lord!

550
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:40,958
Save me.

551
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:42,500
Look.

552
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,291
Save me.

553
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:46,541
I don't want to go out.

554
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:51,083
Look.

555
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,000
Thank yöu very much, son.

556
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,208
Thank yöu very much.

557
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:57,750
I tried telling yöu so many times.

558
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,375
The house is on fire.

559
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:04,083
But yöu were drunk.

560
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:06,333
Wow! There are so many people here...

561
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,625
...but, only yöu showed courage.

562
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,500
yöu're the real hero.

563
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,125
Can I shake hands?

564
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:19,625
So, hero. See yöu.

565
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:21,708
Where did he land me?

566
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:27,458
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>For the first time, I've noticed love in my beloved's eyes.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

567
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,041
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

568
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:31,833
Did yöu see, my lollypop shook my hand?

569
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,166
Who are yöu?

570
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,125
It's me, Rajkumar.

571
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:38,666
Take a look, yöu fool.

572
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:40,875
'Wow! There are so many people here...'

573
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:44,125
'...but, only yöu showed courage.'

574
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,333
'yöu're the real hero.'

575
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:48,500
'Can I shake hands?'

576
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,708
That means Chanda thanked me...

577
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:53,333
...without knowing who I am.

578
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:57,333
Let's go home...

579
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,416
That means, my efforts of saving this old man...

580
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:08,250
...was wasted.
- What?

581
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,250
Come on.

582
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:21,583
The house was on fire...

583
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,875
What a boy.

584
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,333
I didn't get a good look at him.

585
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,666
I should've taken his name and number.

586
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:33,916
Shut up!

587
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:38,083
He did that only to impress me.

588
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:41,833
If he can risk his life only to impress yöu...

589
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:46,208
...then, imagine what he'll do for love.

590
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:50,208
Look ahead.

591
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:54,333
Have yöu lost yöur mind?

592
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,375
First yöu let me slap yöu at the restaurant.

593
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:57,541
Then yöu followed my car.

594
00:46:58,041 --> 00:46:58,791
Jumped in the fire.

595
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,000
And now yöu hurled yöurself in front of my car.

596
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,541
So, yöu noticed everything.

597
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:08,541
Do yöu know who I am?

598
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:12,125
yöu're a girl, I am a boy.

599
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:13,458
What else do we want?

600
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:14,875
Have yöu seen yöurself in the mirror?

601
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,625
We're not even of the same height.

602
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,583
Yes.

603
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:22,541
So yöu'll only fall in love with Amitabh Bachchan?

604
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:23,875
Have yöu seen yöur weight?

605
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,916
Did I say anything?

606
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:29,375
I'm adjusting too.

607
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:31,041
Who do yöu think yöu are?

608
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:33,500
I've proposals from affluent families.

609
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,125
They all want to marry me.

610
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:36,750
Hey!

611
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:40,750
I love yöu!

612
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:48,500
Don't yöu get it?

613
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,458
Affluent boys...

614
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:53,958
Hey!

615
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:58,000
If any boy comes anywhere close to yöu...

616
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,000
...I'll break his limbs.

617
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:06,666
yöu'll only marry me.

618
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:09,375
Remember that.

619
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12,375
Love doesn't depend on height, weight or color.

620
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:14,041
Love comes from here.

621
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:18,041
From the heart.

622
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:28,041
I made a big mistake, sir.

623
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,125
I only stole one packet of opium.

624
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:32,458
I beg yöu.

625
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:33,916
Please forgive me.

626
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:35,958
Boss. It's lunchtime.

627
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:37,750
Lunch has been served.
- Is it?

628
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,750
I will never...

629
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:45,875
Shall I stab yöu too? Go and cry there.

630
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:51,833
The hunger's getting on my mind.

631
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:52,875
What do yöu think?

632
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:54,041
What should we do?

633
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:56,791
Mix the mango pickle with chicken pieces...

634
00:48:57,291 --> 00:49:00,458
...and eat it...it'll taste wonderful.

635
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:03,666
Hey! I'm talking about Parmar.

636
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:05,541
It's been two days, he has retorted.

637
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,833
Go. Go and shut him up!
- Yes.

638
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:11,375
Let's go. Chicken pickle...

639
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:14,041
Pour some pickle.

640
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:18,583
The moon's entering in the lower house...

641
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:20,083
...of yöur horoscope tomorrow.

642
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,541
There's going to be a big change.

643
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:25,208
We'll just have to arrange a big veneration.

644
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:28,000
Tomorrow morning is the best time for it.

645
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,000
Should I start making the preparations?

646
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:37,041
It's nice.

647
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,416
Brother. Only three dips.

648
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:44,625
yöur life will turn around.

649
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:48,625
One.

650
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:03,041
Two.

651
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,000
Three.

652
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:37,541
It's turned around.

653
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:41,541
Life's turned around.

654
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:29,791
It's so heavily guarded.

655
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:33,791
How will we get in?

656
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:44,125
yöu bull, stop staring at me.

657
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:45,208
I doubt his intentions.

658
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:49,208
Rajkumar, let's go.

659
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,375
We are not cowards.

660
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,916
I've been threatened before.

661
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,375
50 villages support me.

662
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:12,833
Who does Shivraj think he is?

663
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:16,791
He's no match for me in this business.

664
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:20,791
Bloody...

665
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:27,291
Sorry, sir.

666
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:28,291
Uncle, yöu called?

667
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,625
Did yöu eat?
- No. I will after I take a bath.

668
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:34,625
Don't forget to eat.
- Yes.

669
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,541
He's my Lollypop's uncle.

670
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:49,541
We cannot kill him.

671
00:52:57,583 --> 00:53:00,583
Boss. yöu talk to him.

672
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:03,708
Stupid oaf.

673
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:04,458
Hello.

674
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:07,583
This isn't the right time to kill Parmar.

675
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:08,666
Come back.

676
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:13,791
Brother will speak to yöu tomorrow.

677
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,791
Boss has cancelled the plan to kill Parmar.

678
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,250
See.

679
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:23,250
The power of my love.

680
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:58,708
Not the electricity again...

681
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:24,333
What are yöu doing?

682
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:27,291
I saw yöu without yöur top.

683
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:30,083
And now, so did yöu.

684
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,083
Now, we're on the same level.

685
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:37,083
Leave quietly, otherwise...

686
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:46,458
If yöu say it furiously, I won't go.

687
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:51,833
Say it with love, and I can even die.

688
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:53,583
I'll count till 3.

689
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:57,583
If yöu don't leave, I'll scream.

690
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:19,791
yöu think I'm joking...

691
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:24,083
One...

692
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:27,500
Two...

693
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,500
Look. I'll count till three and scream.

694
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,666
Three...

695
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:45,583
I knew yöu wouldn't.

696
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:55,500
Madam.

697
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,500
Madam.

698
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,333
Madam.

699
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,375
Is everything okay?

700
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:21,541
Everything's fine.

701
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:25,541
Okay. I'll switch on the generator.

702
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,958
yöu...hate me, don't yöu?

703
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:37,958
No!

704
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:45,708
yöu'll come see me tomorrow.

705
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:48,416
8 am, at the Shiv Temple.

706
00:56:48,916 --> 00:56:51,416
If yöu're late, I'll leave.

707
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:55,416
The rest is up to yöu.

708
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,625
Shiva. yöu're late.

709
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:05,625
I've been waiting for yöu at the temple.

710
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:20,166
Hi.

711
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:22,500
yöu've been waiting for me for an hour, weren't yöu?

712
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,500
I wasn't waiting for yöu?
- I see.

713
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:29,541
I came here to apologies...

714
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:32,208
...for the wrong yöu did yesterday.

715
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:34,875
From here?
- Yes, here.

716
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:37,500
Fine. yöu apologies.

717
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,083
And, I'll thank Him. From here.

718
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,375
Lord. I want to thank yöu.

719
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,958
For letting me see a girl...

720
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:48,333
yöu saw me, didn't yöu?

721
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:52,333
No need to propagate it.

722
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:01,833

01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:38,375
Instead of annihilating each other...

801
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:40,541
...it's better we forget this enmity...

802
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:43,958
...and, become family.

803
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:48,166
This deal is for best for both of us.

804
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:50,666
From today, this village...

805
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:53,500
...will have two kings, not one.

806
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,500
And then...only happiness.

807
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:06,125
Only happiness.

808
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:12,833
Wasn't one enough, that now we have two.

809
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:16,083
Today, I'm getting my niece Chanda...

810
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:17,875
...engaged to Shivraj.

811
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:21,875
Congratulations!

812
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:25,583
Pandit.

813
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,208
When's the auspicious date?

814
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:30,500
Sir, Dussera's the best day for the wedding.

815
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,833
Wonderful.

816
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:37,125
Next month, on Dussera...

817
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:41,250
...Chanda and Shivraj will get married.

818
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,291
Where's my bride?
- Locked in that room.

819
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:47,166
I used force, but she isn't agreeing.

820
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:49,750
Leave this job to me.

821
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,750
I'll go convince her.

822
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:03,958
Beautiful.

823
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:08,250
Very beautiful.

824
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:13,583
If it was business, then I would've used force.

825
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:16,916
But this about love.

826
01:05:17,416 --> 01:05:20,083
So, I'm thinking from my heart.

827
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,833
Take a good look at me.

828
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:26,416
yöu won't find a man like me here.

829
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:32,000
yöu're really fortunate that I like yöu.

830
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,333
I am the king.

831
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:39,333
Feeling coy.

832
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:24,250
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>yöu can't go far from me.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

833
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,666
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>Everywhere yöu go, yöu'll only find me.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

834
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:31,666
Bring the girl here.

835
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:35,458
Didn't yöu hear?

836
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:39,458
Bring her here.

837
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,791
Hey. Have yöu gone deaf?

838
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,125
Bring the girl here.

839
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:49,125
Sir, we'll arrange wedding splendidly.

840
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:07,250
How did the brother's luck go bad?

841
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:11,250
Chanda's only mine.

842
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:19,208
I love Chanda.

843
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:21,291
What did yöu say, yöu rascal?

844
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:27,083
yöu mongrel...how could yöu even think like that?

845
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:29,625
Chanda loves me too.

846
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:31,958
Rascal. Do yöu know where yöu are...

847
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:33,291
...and who yöu're talking to?

848
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:35,666
Curse yöu, yöu swine.

849
01:07:36,166 --> 01:07:38,541
I'll tie yöu up and rape her in front of yöu.

850
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:41,083
Shivraj!

851
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:43,208
Be silent.

852
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:47,208
Or I'll get violent.

853
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:18,916
There are just two things in my life.

854
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:20,916
Love. Love. Love.

855
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:24,291
Or Fight. Fight. Fight.

856
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:29,875
I can take Chanda away if I want, but I won't.

857
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:32,541
Because I am a man.

858
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:34,458
I can do anything for money...

859
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:40,166
...so just think... What I can do for my love.

860
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:43,125
The wedding's on Dussera, right?

861
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:45,541
So, make the preparations.

862
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:47,208
yöur place.

863
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:48,791
yöur venue.

864
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:54,875
But I...will marry Chanda, not yöu.

865
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:58,875
Stop me if yöu can.

866
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:27,208
Sir. I found out everything about Romeo.

867
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:29,000
He hails from Bagalpur.

868
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,541
There are four cases of vandalism against him.

869
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:33,875
Is yöur information correct?

870
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:35,208
I hope he doesn't turn out...

871
01:12:35,708 --> 01:12:37,125
...to be an undercover cop.

872
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:40,833
That rascal has challenged brother.

873
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,458
What do yöu think?

874
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,250
Who is going to win?

875
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:50,458
Me...or him?

876
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:52,833
Speak up, who is going to win?

877
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:55,708
Brother. What's wrong with yöu?

878
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:57,375
yöu're the king.

879
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:58,875
And he's just a pauper.

880
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,625
That planetary positions are in yöur favor.

881
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:06,041
yöur enemies don't stand a chance against yöu.

882
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:07,750
That boy's no match for yöu.

883
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,750
Yes, boss. yöu will win.

884
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,500
Why didn't yöu speak up earlier?

885
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,791
Because, yöu had a doubt.

886
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:25,416
And, the entire village has the same doubt.

887
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:31,208
Even Chanda would have the same doubt.

888
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:37,208
If I had killed him at the temple...

889
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:41,375
...then, he would've gained Chanda's sympathy.

890
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:45,250
But I am a man.

891
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,583
I will marry her on Dussera.

892
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:51,375
And, after I am done with that worm...

893
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:55,375
...Chanda, will readily agree to marry me.

894
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:13,166
Where are yöu go, sweetheart?

895
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:15,708
Who are yöu?
- She's Bindu.

896
01:14:16,208 --> 01:14:18,041
She'll stay with yöu all the time.

897
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:18,875
But why?

898
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:21,958
Because yöu're my future bride.

899
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,041
And if that fool comes here.

900
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:29,416
I swear on my love, I will kill like a dog.

901
01:14:29,916 --> 01:14:33,208
yöu see, yöu're an exquisite flower.

902
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:37,083
And, I want to feel yöu gently.

903
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:38,833
Not crush yöu.

904
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:42,041
Gentleman.

905
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:44,708
Same height. Same complexion.

906
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:48,708
Match made in Heaven!

907
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,500
I wish someone so protective over me...

908
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,333
...no one would've dared to touch me.

909
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:03,333
This old man looks mischievous.

910
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:11,916
Stop exposing in front of me.

911
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:21,041
I guess yöu're busy thinking about me.

912
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:23,875
I didn't get a chance to miss yöu.

913
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:29,708
That Shivraj's made my life hell.

914
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:30,666
Saturn's position...

915
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:37,250
Brother. Brother.

916
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:42,125
Chanda and Rajkumar were talking on the phone.

917
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:45,250
To impress me one has to be a good dancer.

918
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,250
He should know English.

919
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,041
He should be able to read English poetry.

920
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:50,500
He should wear modern clothes.

921
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,208
Flaunt a style.

922
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:54,291
If anyone does all this, then...

923
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:56,541
...I'll be impressed.

924
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:58,208
Chanda.

925
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:02,208
Shivraj's going to win yöur heart now.

926
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:09,208
Brother.

927
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:10,916
Here's the professor.

928
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:13,208
He'll teach yöu fantastic English...

929
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:15,666
...and Chanda will be completely floored.

930
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:17,250
Good morning, sir.

931
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:20,375
Sit.

932
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:21,708
Shall we begin?

933
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:24,166
A!

934
01:16:24,666 --> 01:16:28,166
yöu dare disrespect me!

935
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:30,208
I didn't mean any disrespect.

936
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:32,166
I meant A for Apple.

937
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:36,083
Professor, he knows all that.

938
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:38,166
He's studied till class four.

939
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:40,625
I know that much English.

940
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:44,166
I only have a problem with speaking.

941
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:49,000
Bastard.
- What did yöu say?

942
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,916
Bastard means...a big stud.

943
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:59,041
A man who doesn't spare a single woman.

944
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:05,208
Then brother's a big bastard.

945
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:06,791
Professor.

946
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:09,875
Teach him some English poetry.

947
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:15,125
He'll take a year.

948
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:16,833
One month.

949
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,541
One day.

950
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:23,541
One hour!

951
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,041
Bull shit!
- What?

952
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:32,750
That's the title of the poem.

953
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:33,875
Bull shit!

954
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:37,416
Then tell him yöur bull shit poem.

955
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:40,041
Yes.

956
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:44,541

964
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,083
yöu're my bool.
- Not, bool!

965
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:15,791
Bull.

966
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:18,666

What's this?

977
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:14,625
This is hip hop break-dance.

978
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:18,625
Brother do this.

979
01:19:21,916 --> 01:19:24,083
Stop.

980
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:26,083
This won't do.

981
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:27,583
yöu know, Prabhu Deva.

982
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:29,791
Teach me the way he dances.

983
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:31,375
I will make do with that.

984
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:34,000
Brother can never do this.

985
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,875
I know what yöu're thinking.

986
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:38,416
I'm thinking the same.

987
01:19:38,916 --> 01:19:46,250
But, if yöu want to keep dancing, then teach him.

988
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,458
This is a duet.

989
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:52,375
We'll need a girl.

990
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:56,500
yöu called.
- She's here. Mischievous girl.

991
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,750
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>Our friendship gets me high.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

998
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:17,958
yöu're really naughty.

999
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:20,625
yöu fell on me intentionally.

1000
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:23,208
Stay away from her, brother.

1001
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:28,333
She's hazardous to health.

1002
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:31,833
How did yöu know I was thinking about yöu?

1003
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:33,125
I am angry with yöu.

1004
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:34,416
Only saints get angry.

1005
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:35,291
What's wrong with yöu?

1006
01:20:35,791 --> 01:20:37,416
yöu didn't call to wish me.

1007
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,208
Wish? Is it yöur birthday?

1008
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:41,083
Only rich people have birthdays.

1009
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:42,583
Then, it must be the day yöu were born?

1010
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:45,125
No. Think harder.

1011
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:46,541
Don't trouble me.

1012
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:48,458
Tell me what is it.

1013
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:52,458
It's so serious matter.

1014
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:58,333
One of yöur men, the bald one.

1015
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,541
Has big mustaches.

1016
01:21:01,041 --> 01:21:03,458
He's giving me shady looks.

1017
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,666
Yes.

1018
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:08,166
What's yöur name?

1019
01:21:08,666 --> 01:21:11,208
Say yöur name.

1020
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:11,833
He isn't saying.

1021
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:15,833
yöu talk to him.

1022
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:20,291
Yes. Now continue.

1023
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,250
Today is our 10th Golden Jubilee.

1024
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,750
Golden Jubilee?

1025
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:24,625
What?

1026
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:29,500
I'm calling yöu after 500 hour 50 minutes and 50 seconds...

1027
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,083
...since I saw yöu first.

1028
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:32,916
But, why tell me all this?

1029
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:34,625
I'm already impressed by yöu.

1030
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:38,291
yöu never praise me, Lollypop.

1031
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:41,833
Listen. The plan's going just like yöu said.

1032
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:44,750
That clown's learning English and dancing.

1033
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,000
He has a mind and body of an oaf.

1034
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,708
We'll drive him insane until Dussera.

1035
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:51,791
Then, I deserve a kiss for the success.

1036
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:54,208
What? Kiss?

1037
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,250
yöu can take all yöu want when we meet.

1038
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:00,125
I want it now.

1039
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:04,125
yöu won't listen, will yöu?

1040
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:18,375
Love. Love. Love Or Fight. Fight. Fight.

1041
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:20,083
That's strong.

1042
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:24,083
Love. Love.

1043
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:33,458
Chanda, what's wrong with yöur voice?

1044
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,208
yöu swine.

1045
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:38,416
Brother. This title belongs to yöu.

1046
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:41,875
yöu've learned to do the break dance, so now learn cooking as well.

1047
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:45,875
On my wedding, I would love to eat yöur cooking.

1048
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:52,916
Remember, I love chicken stuffed bread.

1049
01:22:57,291 --> 01:22:58,500
All the stars were in his favor.

1050
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,708
But, he's put his stars in jeopardy.

1051
01:23:01,208 --> 01:23:05,208
My arms are bigger than his thighs.

1052
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:07,375
But I've got more brains.

1053
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:11,125
Bindu.
- Yes.

1054
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:17,583
yöur wrong information spoiled everything.

1055
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:19,791
yöu don't worry.

1056
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:23,541
For yöu...I'm a gentleman.

1057
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,875
I love yöu.

1058
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:31,333
Good. We'll play.

1059
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:32,958
It's going to be fun.

1060
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:34,916
Lot's of fun.

1061
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:38,916
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>Love. Love. Love Or Fight. Fight. Fight.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

1062
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:48,208
He's drinking at the boss' bar after bothering him.

1063
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:50,291
Beat him to a pulp.

1064
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:54,166
I've brought the most ferocious goons along.

1065
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:58,166
Beat him.

1066
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:02,625
Are yöu Romeo Rajkumar?
- Yes.

1067
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,333
Isn't that what yöu were thinking?

1068
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:30,416
Do yöu know what I was thinking?

1069
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:34,416
Look at this.

1070
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,250
Don't hit me.

1071
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:20,250
I didn't even lift a finger.

1072
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:22,291
Don't be scared.

1073
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:26,291
Drink it.

1074
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:31,166
I was thinking...violence and bloodshed is useless.

1075
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:33,916
What can I do for Chanda?

1076
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:35,708
Nothing.

1077
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:38,833
But if she marries Shivraj...

1078
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:41,791
...her life will be filled with happiness.

1079
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:47,666
And Chanda's happiness means everything to me.

1080
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:48,791
yöu're so generous.

1081
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:50,833
Kind hearted.

1082
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:53,208
What are yöu doing, Chatur Singh.

1083
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:55,541
yöu shouldn't bow before the yöung ones.

1084
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:58,375
yöu should hug them.

1085
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:02,375
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>I pray...may yöur life's filled with joy.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

1086
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:11,041
I don't want to eat this!

1087
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:15,041
So, don't eat.

1088
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:20,125
What is it?

1089
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:23,875
Rajkumar's sent it.

1090
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:27,833
And said, when I give this Taj Mahal to yöu...

1091
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:30,708
...there will be tears in yöur eyes.

1092
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:33,125
And, I cannot see tears.

1093
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:38,666
He said "Forget him and marry Shivraj".

1094
01:26:39,166 --> 01:26:42,666
He's sent this last gift.

1095
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:49,166
Take a look.

1096
01:26:49,666 --> 01:26:51,166
Did yöu see?

1097
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:52,833
There he is.

1098
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:53,666
Sir...

1099
01:26:54,166 --> 01:26:55,750
Sir, what happened?

1100
01:26:56,250 --> 01:27:00,041
Beat him.

1101
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:03,750
Help!

1102
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,708
Sir. Why are yöu beating me?

1103
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:09,750
Tell me what I've done.

1104
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:13,750

1110
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:32,875
Beat me.

1111
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:35,875
Beat me.

1112
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:37,041
Beat him!

1113
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:41,000
Beat me slowly.

1114
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,458
Beat him!

1115
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:46,791
Come on
- Go to hell!

1116
01:27:47,291 --> 01:27:48,791
Come on.

1117
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:49,916
yöu too.

1118
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:50,708
Beat me.

1119
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:54,708
Tear me to shreds.

1120
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:16,750
All lines in this route are available only for yöu.

1121
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,875
So, come and give me a small recharge, darling.

1122
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:23,875

What can I do for yöu?

1181
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,958
Show me the best and the most expensive...

1182
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:32,958
...sari in yöur shop.

1183
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:34,500
Come, sir.

1184
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,625
Look at this.

1185
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:38,208
That's nice.

1186
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:41,958
Don't hover over them like black clouds.

1187
01:32:42,458 --> 01:32:44,000
Let's go.

1188
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,958
Bindu.

1189
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:52,208
Let's take a look over there.
- So many saris are there.

1190
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:54,208
Buy me a sari as well.

1191
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:55,625
Allow me.

1192
01:32:56,125 --> 01:32:59,625
Are yöu used to wearing a sari?

1193
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:09,333
I'll choose myself.

1194
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:37,250
Who is it? he doesn't work here.

1195
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,750
How's this?

1196
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:54,750
Finally...her heart's melting.

1197
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:01,375
Nice.

1198
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:05,375
Can I try it on?

1199
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:11,333
Show me that one.

1200
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:14,416
That one.

1201
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:17,750
Pack that.

1202
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:19,708
What happened? Get changed.

1203
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:21,625
Turn around.

1204
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:25,333
Don't ask me to turn around.

1205
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:31,416
That goes in between the ones who love.

1206
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:32,375
I know what's going to happen...

1207
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:34,250
...if I change when yöu're here.

1208
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:38,250
Come on. Turn around.

1209
01:34:48,041 --> 01:34:51,541
Control.

1210
01:34:57,833 --> 01:35:01,333
Photo.

1211
01:35:06,041 --> 01:35:08,083
Fine, are yöu happy now.

1212
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:12,083
Gents room is that side...

1213
01:35:38,541 --> 01:35:38,708
Remove it.

1214
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:42,708
Hey!

1215
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:53,166
Go...and defeat my Rajkumar like a man.

1216
01:35:53,666 --> 01:35:55,166
Then come to me.

1217
01:35:55,666 --> 01:36:01,625
I'll marry yöu...and even take off the sari.

Uncle.

1223
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:43,708
Few cows are easy to control.

1224
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:48,708
But, some need to taste leather.

1225
01:36:49,208 --> 01:36:51,291
If my parents were alive...

1226
01:36:51,791 --> 01:36:53,000
...would yöu treat me the same way?

1227
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,041
yöur parents aren't alive.

1228
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:56,250
They're dead.

1229
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:58,291
I'm yöur only kin.

1230
01:36:58,791 --> 01:37:03,583
yöu will do as I say.

1231
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:06,458
Nothing else.

1232
01:37:06,958 --> 01:37:07,833
Nothing else.

1233
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:10,791
yöur parents are dead?

1234
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:15,458
yöu dare be audacious.

1235
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:18,041
Who do yöu think yöu are?

1236
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:19,708
What do yöu think?

1237
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:21,916
It's the question of my honor.

1238
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:25,916
yöu cannot do as yöu please.

1239
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:33,000
Don't yöu dare...

1240
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:39,000
...if I hear yöu speak his name, I'll make yöu pay.

1241
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:43,000
Take that.

1242
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:54,541
The design of the wedding card is fantastic.

1243
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:56,625
Have it distributed in the entire village.

1244
01:37:57,125 --> 01:38:00,208
Chanda's marriage will be a grand one.

1245
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,750
It's definitely going to be a grand one.

1246
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:06,041
There will be fireworks all around.

1247
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:10,041
And, Romeo will die of jealousy.

1248
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:22,250
It fell here, but the sound's coming from there.

1249
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:26,250
Sir!

1250
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:37,791
Sir.
- Sir where are yöu?

1251
01:38:43,208 --> 01:38:44,791
Why did yöu bring me here?

1252
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:48,125
Tell me, why are yöu bring me here.

1253
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:50,625
What did yöu say?

1254
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:55,083
Son, I just asked...why bring me here?

1255
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:59,041
Why are yöu taking off yöur belt?

1256
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:00,291
Why are yöu taking off yöur belt?

1257
01:39:00,791 --> 01:39:03,791
I want yöu get beat me, my future uncle-in-law.

1258
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:05,625
Here, hit me.

1259
01:39:06,125 --> 01:39:09,625
Son, me?
- Yes. yöu.

1260
01:39:13,916 --> 01:39:19,250
yöu are so small in age.

1261
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:21,958
That's not the way.

1262
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:25,541
Well, let me remind yöu.

1263
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:29,541
Papa...

1264
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,500
I'm yöur elder.

1265
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,875
Here.

1266
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:44,708
Now yöu.
- No.

1267
01:39:45,208 --> 01:39:48,708
Take it, papa.
- Yes.

1268
01:40:11,291 --> 01:40:17,000
If yöu take another step, I will kill yöu.

1269
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:21,000
I'm here.

1270
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:35,250
Love. Love. Love Or Fight. Fight. Fight.

1271
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:46,958
When I come to marry Chanda...

1272
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:50,166
...if I see a single scratch on her body.

1273
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:55,541
I'll skin yöu alive.

1274
01:40:56,041 --> 01:41:00,333
So what if her parents are dead?

1275
01:41:00,833 --> 01:41:02,458
I'm there.

1276
01:41:02,958 --> 01:41:05,333
I get it.

1277
01:41:05,833 --> 01:41:07,666
Let's check there.

1278
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:11,666
yöur dogs have sniffed yöu out.

1279
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:20,208
Be silent...or I'll get violent.

1280
01:41:40,958 --> 01:41:41,916
Sir, where were yöu?

1281
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:43,083
We've been looking for yöu...

1282
01:41:43,583 --> 01:41:46,291
...for the past three hours.

1283
01:41:46,791 --> 01:41:47,500
Don't ask anything.

1284
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,041
I've never seen sir so angry before.

1285
01:41:51,541 --> 01:41:53,916
Look at how red his eyes are.

1286
01:41:54,416 --> 01:41:56,333
It has become red with blood.

1287
01:41:56,833 --> 01:41:58,000
I'm scared of looking at him.

1288
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:02,000
Sir is really worried about yöu.

1289
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:25,250
He hit me!

1290
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:28,125
Mother and father.

1291
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:32,666
He hit yöur son!

1292
01:42:33,166 --> 01:42:38,750
Here.
- Sir.

1293
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,875
Come to meet yöu.

1294
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:45,000
yöu go, I am coming.

1295
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:49,000
Okay fine.

1296
01:42:50,291 --> 01:42:53,791
No peacefully does not also cry.

1297
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:10,916
That stupid Rajkumar was threatening me...

1298
01:43:11,416 --> 01:43:15,083
'Papa!'

1299
01:43:15,583 --> 01:43:16,666
But, I wasn't scared.

1300
01:43:17,166 --> 01:43:18,208
And told him clearly...

1301
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:24,583
Chanda will marry only Shivraj.

1302
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:26,458
I was going to strangle him...

1303
01:43:26,958 --> 01:43:28,208
...and just then my men arrived.

1304
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:30,541
And he fled.

1305
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:31,916
If they had arrived a little later...

1306
01:43:32,416 --> 01:43:35,791
...it would've been all over.

1307
01:43:36,291 --> 01:43:38,583
For him!

1308
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:41,250
Didn't I tell yöu?

1309
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:44,291
The stars are strongly in yöur favor...

1310
01:43:44,791 --> 01:43:46,708
...and anyone who's under yöur protection...

1311
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:49,416
...can never be harmed.

1312
01:43:49,916 --> 01:43:53,416
My prediction can never be wrong.

1313
01:44:04,458 --> 01:44:09,166
Then, what's this?

1314
01:44:09,666 --> 01:44:11,958
Imposter. "Never be harmed" yöu said.

1315
01:44:12,458 --> 01:44:17,416
He flogged me like a donkey.

1316
01:44:17,916 --> 01:44:18,458
yöu...

1317
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:20,500
If yöu make any more predictions...

1318
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,458
...I will break yöur teeth.

1319
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:26,458
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>Break yöur teeth,<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

1320
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:35,791
What is this smoke?

1321
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:16,875
Even if she gets a scratch.

1322
01:45:17,375 --> 01:45:19,416
yöu let it be.

1323
01:45:19,916 --> 01:45:23,416
I will handle this.

1324
01:45:28,666 --> 01:45:32,166
Love. Love. Love Or Fight. Fight. Fight.

1325
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:43,083
Romeo.

1326
01:45:43,583 --> 01:45:44,666
Are yöu coming to the temple with me tomorrow?

1327
01:45:45,166 --> 01:45:46,125
Why the temple?

1328
01:45:46,625 --> 01:45:48,625
Are we getting married?

1329
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:50,166
It's the Parvati veneration tomorrow.

1330
01:45:50,666 --> 01:45:52,583
If any couple performs this veneration together...

1331
01:45:53,083 --> 01:45:54,250
...no one can stop them from...

1332
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:55,708
...leading a happy married life.

1333
01:45:56,208 --> 01:45:59,250
Bring a 'Mangalsutra' and a sari, for the offering.

1334
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:00,583
Done, Lollypop.

1335
01:46:01,083 --> 01:46:02,833
Meet me at the village square.

1336
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:04,958
We'll go together.

1337
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:06,375
Give me a kiss.

1338
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:10,375
Okay, done.

1339
01:46:28,958 --> 01:46:31,416
Come on. It's the Parvati veneration.

1340
01:46:31,916 --> 01:46:35,416
We've to go to the temple.

1341
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:40,166
If any couple performs this together...

1342
01:46:40,666 --> 01:46:42,333
...no one can stop them from...

1343
01:46:42,833 --> 01:46:45,333
...leading a happy married life.

1344
01:46:45,833 --> 01:46:48,125
Look. I've also brought a red sari.

1345
01:46:48,625 --> 01:46:50,208
Along with a 'Mangalsutra'.

1346
01:46:50,708 --> 01:46:54,208
For the offering.

1347
01:47:13,208 --> 01:47:14,166
After we get married...

1348
01:47:14,666 --> 01:47:17,208
...I'll take yöu to Paris for honeymoon.

1349
01:47:17,708 --> 01:47:23,875
And, in a small closed room... I'll take off yöur sari.

1350
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:27,583
And I will mash yöu in such way...

1351
01:47:28,083 --> 01:47:30,333
Hug yöu.

1352
01:47:30,833 --> 01:47:33,666
I'll kiss yöur lips.

1353
01:47:34,166 --> 01:47:37,666
It's going to be so much fun.

1354
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:41,916
Excuse me.

1355
01:47:42,416 --> 01:47:45,083
Hello, Romeo.

1356
01:47:45,583 --> 01:47:49,458
Lollypop's going to the temple with Shivraj.

1357
01:47:49,958 --> 01:47:53,541
We'll pray to the Goddess.

1358
01:47:54,041 --> 01:47:57,666
And Shivraj will help yöu Behold the Lord personally.

1359
01:47:58,166 --> 01:48:00,208
Here yöu go, talk to Shivraj,

1360
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:04,541
Listen. I've learnt cooking.

1361
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:07,458
yöu love chicken stuffed bread, don't yöu?

1362
01:48:07,958 --> 01:48:09,208
That's what I'll treat everyone...

1363
01:48:09,708 --> 01:48:11,125
...on yöur mourning.

1364
01:48:11,625 --> 01:48:15,375
I've just one motive, to cater to all of yöu.

1365
01:48:15,875 --> 01:48:18,375
I'm ready to change parties 100 times...

1366
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:21,208
...only for yöu.

1367
01:48:21,708 --> 01:48:26,333
Glory to...
- Kalyan Lokseva

1368
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:27,625
Who threw the shoe?

1369
01:48:28,125 --> 01:48:30,583
yöu thief. Shut up!

1370
01:48:31,083 --> 01:48:32,541
yöu made big promises the last time as well.

1371
01:48:33,041 --> 01:48:34,291
But, yöu didn't do anything.

1372
01:48:34,791 --> 01:48:36,333
If yöu cheat us again, then...

1373
01:48:36,833 --> 01:48:39,208
See my men, they're also carrying weapons.

1374
01:48:39,708 --> 01:48:40,375
They will cut yöu to pieces.

1375
01:48:40,875 --> 01:48:44,541
Beat him.

1376
01:48:45,041 --> 01:48:46,875
Wait.

1377
01:48:47,375 --> 01:48:51,750
Not just them, I've more men coming here in those cars.

1378
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:53,750
They will kill yöu all.

1379
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:55,083
He'll put us in trouble.

1380
01:48:55,583 --> 01:48:57,875
What are yöu waiting for? Stop the car.

1381
01:48:58,375 --> 01:49:01,875
Beat them.

1382
01:49:17,958 --> 01:49:19,500
Sir, Shivraj's coming.
- What Shivraj's car?

1383
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,833
Move. Move. Move.

1384
01:49:23,333 --> 01:49:25,291
Tell them to move.
- yöur man threw a shoe at me.

1385
01:49:25,791 --> 01:49:26,458
Disrupted my gathering.

1386
01:49:26,958 --> 01:49:29,250
They're my men. Clear them out.

1387
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:32,041
Brothers, there was a misunderstanding.

1388
01:49:32,541 --> 01:49:35,208
Rascal.
- They were not Shivraj's men.

1389
01:49:35,708 --> 01:49:40,375
I'm a peace loving man.

1390
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:41,750
Where is she?

1391
01:49:42,250 --> 01:49:43,583
Rajkumar.

1392
01:49:44,083 --> 01:49:46,166
He took Chanda.

1393
01:49:46,666 --> 01:49:53,250

1399
01:50:48,916 --> 01:50:51,208
Where are yöur parents?

1400
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:52,250
If my parents were alive...

1401
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:55,250
...my name would've been only 'Rajkumar'.

1402
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:59,250
Chanda's my only kin.

1403
01:51:01,208 --> 01:51:02,500
And yöurs?

1404
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,791
All I have is an uncle.

1405
01:51:04,291 --> 01:51:05,625
But, he isn't here.

1406
01:51:06,125 --> 01:51:06,500
Hurry up.

1407
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,375
If only yöu could receive the blessings of yöur elders...

1408
01:51:09,875 --> 01:51:10,666
...it would've been really nice.

1409
01:51:11,166 --> 01:51:16,083
The elders are right here.

1410
01:51:16,583 --> 01:51:20,083
For us, they are like our children.

1411
01:51:32,916 --> 01:51:34,375
Hi!

1412
01:51:34,875 --> 01:51:41,291
Where's the rascal?
- Don't fight with each other. Live happily.

1413
01:51:41,791 --> 01:51:43,083
yöu're a bit late.

1414
01:51:43,583 --> 01:51:44,041
Romeo was here.

1415
01:51:44,541 --> 01:51:46,333
We finished praying as well.

1416
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:48,375
Don't worry.

1417
01:51:48,875 --> 01:51:50,958
We've given her our blessings.

1418
01:51:51,458 --> 01:51:53,750
They will live happily ever after.

1419
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:56,750
Romeo brought me here, but how will I go back?

1420
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:59,166
Will yöu take me back home, won't yöu?

1421
01:51:59,666 --> 01:52:01,791
Life was supposed to spin clockwise...

1422
01:52:02,291 --> 01:52:06,208
...how did it spin the other way round?

1423
01:52:06,708 --> 01:52:09,750
Come on.

1424
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:13,750
Go on.

1425
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:20,083
Love Or Fight.

1426
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:25,041
Romeo said he'll take me to Bangkok for our honeymoon.

1427
01:52:25,541 --> 01:52:26,458
And in the honeymoon suite...

1428
01:52:26,958 --> 01:52:30,250
...he'll take my sari off himself.

1429
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:33,166
And then he'll pinch me.

1430
01:52:33,666 --> 01:52:35,791
And give me a tight hug.

1431
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:39,791
And kiss my lips.

1432
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:55,125
yöu can do anything yöu like before the marriage.

1433
01:52:55,625 --> 01:52:57,250
24 hours.

1434
01:52:57,750 --> 01:53:01,083
24 hours is all he has.

1435
01:53:01,583 --> 01:53:04,583
After that yöu will be mine.

1436
01:53:05,083 --> 01:53:07,166
And I'll take my revenge.

1437
01:53:07,666 --> 01:53:11,166
Get lost.

1438
01:53:14,375 --> 01:53:17,791
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>Love. Love. Love Or Fight. Fight. Fight.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

1441
01:53:27,291 --> 01:53:31,750
I've arrested Romeo.

1442
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:33,750
Come to the police station right now.

1443
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:37,750
And kill him personally.

1444
01:53:42,125 --> 01:53:46,958
Now yöu will know...the power of police.

1445
01:53:47,458 --> 01:53:49,000
Neither the Prime Minister...

1446
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:50,791
...nor the President can kill anyone.

1447
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:54,291
Only the police have a license to kill.

1448
01:53:54,791 --> 01:53:58,291
Get that.

1449
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:01,291
Hello.

1450
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:05,291
Yes.

1451
01:54:09,083 --> 01:54:11,250
Okay.

1452
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:13,166
Okay, sir.

1453
01:54:13,666 --> 01:54:17,166
Okay.

1454
01:54:19,875 --> 01:54:23,375
I'm not arrest yöu, if yöu tell me before.

1455
01:54:28,458 --> 01:54:31,958
I am sorry, forgive me.

1456
01:54:35,208 --> 01:54:39,375
Suits yöu better.

1457
01:54:39,875 --> 01:54:43,375
Me...

1458
01:55:32,125 --> 01:55:35,625
How are yöu, Bullet?
- Ready to fire.

1459
01:55:40,208 --> 01:55:41,958
It's all about time.

1460
01:55:42,458 --> 01:55:44,166
When time changes...

1461
01:55:44,666 --> 01:55:49,583
...even the weak can severe a harsh blow.

1462
01:55:50,083 --> 01:55:54,250
Cowards like Shivaj and Parmar...

1463
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:57,708
...tell me that I can't set foot here.

1464
01:55:58,208 --> 01:56:00,416
But, I just kept my entire palm.

1465
01:56:00,916 --> 01:56:03,208
That Romeo works for Ajit Taka.

1466
01:56:03,708 --> 01:56:06,291
He's come here to kill yöu two.

1467
01:56:06,791 --> 01:56:09,416
He's here to seize the entire area.

1468
01:56:09,916 --> 01:56:11,541
To take charge of yöur opium.

1469
01:56:12,041 --> 01:56:13,208
Well done, Romeo.

1470
01:56:13,708 --> 01:56:14,666
When are yöu making the delivery?

1471
01:56:15,166 --> 01:56:16,583
I've the opium.

1472
01:56:17,083 --> 01:56:20,583
Whenever yöu want, I'll make the delivery.

1473
01:56:35,875 --> 01:56:38,708
The stuff's all here.

1474
01:56:39,208 --> 01:56:42,708
Then why did he talk about stealing?

1475
01:56:48,875 --> 01:56:51,166
To confuse yöu, fool.

1476
01:56:51,666 --> 01:56:55,166
He wanted to find out where's the stuff.

1477
01:56:59,125 --> 01:57:02,625
Shift the entire goods.

1478
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:17,458
Shivraj's entire consignment.

1479
01:58:17,958 --> 01:58:22,333
I'm not impressed, because I knew...

1480
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:24,166
...this job's easy for yöu.

1481
01:58:24,666 --> 01:58:25,708
Sir.

1482
01:58:26,208 --> 01:58:29,708
The truck's empty.

1483
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:45,583
yöu're my brightest man.

1484
01:58:46,083 --> 01:58:48,458
Yet, Shivraj deceived yöu.

1485
01:58:48,958 --> 01:58:50,750
Do yöu know why?

1486
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:54,750
Woman!

1487
01:58:56,500 --> 01:59:00,375
When I was 18... I fell in love with a girl.

1488
01:59:00,875 --> 01:59:04,166
I would cycle for 16 kilometers...

1489
01:59:04,666 --> 01:59:08,708
...under the hot sun, for a single glimpse of her.

1490
01:59:09,208 --> 01:59:12,125
Business and love don't go hand-in-hand.

1491
01:59:12,625 --> 01:59:13,375
Business love.

1492
01:59:13,875 --> 01:59:14,666
Business love.

1493
01:59:15,166 --> 01:59:17,416
I couldn't concentrate on work.

1494
01:59:17,916 --> 01:59:20,583
So I stopped thinking from here.

1495
01:59:21,083 --> 01:59:25,458
And started thinking from here.

1496
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:30,166
I killed her.

1497
01:59:30,666 --> 01:59:35,541
Look where I am...

1498
01:59:36,041 --> 01:59:37,458
Kill her too.

1499
01:59:37,958 --> 01:59:41,250
yöu'll be successful.

1500
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:43,166
Isn't it

1501
01:59:43,666 --> 01:59:47,166
Didn't like it?

1502
02:00:02,458 --> 02:00:05,208
yöur problem is love.

1503
02:00:05,708 --> 02:00:09,416
My problem is losing.

1504
02:00:09,916 --> 02:00:13,416
I can do anything to win.

1505
02:00:18,875 --> 02:00:21,625
Love made yöu useless.

1506
02:00:22,125 --> 02:00:25,625
Otherwise, yöu were a useful man.

1507
02:00:35,791 --> 02:00:38,125
Taka wanted opium.

1508
02:00:38,625 --> 02:00:42,000
And I wanted Chanda.

1509
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:44,166
I'm win.

1510
02:00:44,666 --> 02:00:48,166
And yöu lost.

1511
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:19,333
People like us can turn our enmity into friendship...

1512
02:01:25,041 --> 02:01:28,541
Cheap man like yöu can never understand.

1513
02:01:47,916 --> 02:01:51,416
No!

1514
02:01:58,750 --> 02:02:01,208
Wait.

1515
02:02:01,708 --> 02:02:04,041
Say it.

1516
02:02:04,541 --> 02:02:08,041
Who won?

1517
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:15,291
Speak up.

1518
02:02:15,791 --> 02:02:18,500
Who won?
- yöu won.

1519
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,625
yöu won.

1520
02:02:22,125 --> 02:02:22,916
Go.

1521
02:02:23,416 --> 02:02:24,708
Get in the car.

1522
02:02:25,208 --> 02:02:27,083
It's too sunny.

1523
02:02:27,583 --> 02:02:29,333
No!

1524
02:02:29,833 --> 02:02:31,958
No!

1525
02:02:32,458 --> 02:02:33,833
I'm going.

1526
02:02:34,333 --> 02:02:35,833
I'm going.

1527
02:02:36,333 --> 02:02:39,833
I'm going.

1528
02:03:07,833 --> 02:03:11,333
Take him away. Bury him.

1529
02:03:20,875 --> 02:03:22,791
Congratulations for the new friendship, Shivraj.

1530
02:03:23,291 --> 02:03:24,291
yöu too.

1531
02:03:24,791 --> 02:03:30,458
yöu got the girl, and I get the Opium.

1532
02:03:30,958 --> 02:03:33,291
When are yöu getting married?

1533
02:03:33,791 --> 02:03:37,291
Tonight.

1534
02:04:03,333 --> 02:04:06,833
Chanda's only mine.

1535
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,500
By killing Rajkumar...

1536
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,125
...I've proved to everyone who I am.

1537
02:04:36,625 --> 02:04:40,125
Tonight, I'll prove to yöu.

1538
02:04:43,208 --> 02:04:44,958
Bindu.
- Yes.

1539
02:04:45,458 --> 02:04:48,958
Get Chanda ready and bring her out.

How did he survive?

1591
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,500
Beat him.

1595
02:10:19,333 --> 02:10:24,541
Yes.

02:10:25,041 --> 02:10:27,416
Handful of cowards will face a brave.

1597
02:10:27,916 --> 02:10:29,875
This time we'll...

1598
02:10:30,375 --> 02:10:32,000
'Shivraj!

1599
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:33,958
I can do anything for money...

1600
02:10:34,458 --> 02:10:40,250
...so just think... What I can do for love.

1601
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:43,208
The wedding's on Dussera, right?

1602
02:10:43,708 --> 02:10:45,625
So, make the preparations.

1603
02:10:46,125 --> 02:10:47,375
yöur place.

1604
02:10:47,875 --> 02:10:48,875
yöur venue.

1605
02:10:49,375 --> 02:10:52,750
But I...will marry Chanda, not yöu.

1606
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:56,791
Stop me if yöu can.

1607
02:10:57,291 --> 02:11:03,416
'Go...and defeat my Rajkumar like a man.'

1608
02:11:03,916 --> 02:11:05,375
'Then come to me.'

1609
02:11:05,875 --> 02:11:09,375
'I'll marry yöu...and even take off the sari.'

1610
02:11:14,291 --> 02:11:16,750
Rascal. Do yöu know where yöu are...

1611
02:11:17,250 --> 02:11:18,166
...and what yöu're saying?

1612
02:11:18,666 --> 02:11:20,500
Curse yöu, yöu swine.

1613
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:24,500
I'll tie yöu up and rape her in front of yöu.

1614
02:14:40,083 --> 02:14:45,250
Understood?

1615
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:48,250
See. This will happen to yöu...

1616
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:53,000
...if yöu don't follow my orders.

1617
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:55,250
