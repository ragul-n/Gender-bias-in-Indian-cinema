1
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,644
Bitu.....Did you Steal?

2
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:55,986
To steal is a sin.

3
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,197
Do you know what happens
when... a thief goes to heaven?

4
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,836
-God will cut his hands!
-Cut his hands?

5
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:03,249
Yes!

6
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:11,310
Here...take your toys.

7
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:19,788
-l gave the toys back.
-Bravo!

8
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:21,979
Let me tell you a story.

9
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:24,073
-What story?
-Natwarlal's story.

10
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:25,835
-Natwarlal's story?
-Yes.

11
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,280
Natwarlal was an innocent and.. loving
boy.

12
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,641
He was an orphan.

13
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:33,252
He had a brother and sister-in law.

14
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:36,427
Under who's grace he was living.

15
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:40,179
-Brother..Brother!
-You did say you would bring me toys!

16
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:43,745
Get your toys from your...
Sister-ln Law!

17
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:46,450
-Here is your toy.
-What is that?

18
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,616
lt's a medal son.

19
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,395
Your brother earned by
his... bravery and honesty.

20
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:55,913
What does bravery mean?

21
00:01:56,706 --> 00:01:59,254
-Here!...Put this on your head.
-Bravery is when...

22
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:02,744
dacoits and thieves fight between...
themselves...and bullets fly!

23
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:06,439
And when bullets are fired...
and thieves are caught!

24
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:09,340
l will also catch thieves!

25
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:11,858
-Bravo!
-Thief!....thief!

26
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:18,574
Enough....enough.

27
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,716
-Come my lion!
-Very good!

28
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:24,152
Brother...When l grow up... l
will also become an inspector.

29
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:28,391
l will bring a lot of medals.. and
put them around your neck!

30
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,588
Son..you will get big if you... eat well!

31
00:02:33,276 --> 00:02:34,538
Bhabi....you don't talk to me!

32
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,454
-Why?..
-Why are you angry with your Bhabi?

33
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:40,111
Bhabi said she would bring a doll!

34
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:42,662
-You didn't bring a doll!
-And you want me to eat?

35
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:47,505
-So now even he knows
-Son...let's do one thing..

36
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,062
Both me and you.... we will not eat.

37
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,610
We should know if a girl is coming...

38
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,391
-or a boy is coming.
-What is it?

39
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:55,947
There you go again like a kid!

40
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,907
Come Natwar...let's eat.

41
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:02,819
Do this...ln this situation.. one
doesn't lift..l'll take Natwar.

42
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:04,436
Let's go.

43
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,689
They loved him like a... mother and father.

44
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:11,368
They taught him about truth and...
honesty.

45
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:14,925
But his brother's truth and honesty..

46
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:17,505
created a wall between some people.

47
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:20,705
Especially for Vikram Singh.

48
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,823
When Vikram's friend Mickey...

49
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:27,220
told Vikram about lnspector's...
truth and honesty...

50
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:30,137
He carelessly told him..

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,990
to buy such honest and law abiding..
people..

52
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:35,787
is an easy accomplishment.

53
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:39,326
Because Vikram was known
as a king.. of black marketing!

54
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,913
Because he was proud of
his.. knowledge and power.

55
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,222
He would say one thing...

56
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:47,910
V for Vikram....V for Victory!

57
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:52,809
And this was a sign of his... pride and
power.

58
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,336
And to break this
sign..Gardarilal.. made a vow...

59
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:02,124
But in search of proof...
Gardarilal found nothing!

60
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,089
Or if he found anything...
it was Vikram's enemity.

61
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:24,861
l have dowsed your whole
house.. with gasoline.

62
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,292
But l haven't set it on fire.

63
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,608
There was need for only one match.

64
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:36,794
And your house would have
burned.. to smithereens.

65
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:42,357
Go in your house..and see your.. hearts
content...and the snake next to her!

66
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:53,115
How did this snake get here?

67
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:55,359
Nothing Beta.....nothing!

68
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,004
l could have put enough snakes...

69
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:02,925
...that you could not even walk!

70
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:06,141
Because of this....come to your senses!

71
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,252
And don't mess with me!

72
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,303
You may have come to know who l am.

73
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:15,956
Your enemy....who could
have been... your friend.

74
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,068
Coward!

75
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,719
Scares women and children!

76
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:27,042
Have guts...and take me on!

77
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,905
Saab...He was on his way to commit
murder.

78
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,952
Who did you plan to murder?

79
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:42,552
l want to talk to you in private.

80
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,361
What do you want to talk about?

81
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:50,193
-Vikram..
-You people...go outside!

82
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,066
Close the door.

83
00:05:57,714 --> 00:06:01,457
-Tell me how you know Vikram.
-Me and my brother worked with Vikram.

84
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:06,775
-Yesterday....Vikram killed my brother!
-Put a bullet to him!...l will kill him!

85
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:10,506
-lt's OK...Ok...
-Don't cry.

86
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:15,004
-lf you help us out...
-The law will punish Vikram!

87
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:18,046
Tell me the true whereabouts of Vikram.

88
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:21,819
Saab...They are to kidnap
me at 7:00.. from the fields.

89
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:24,694
You followthem...you will
find... there whereabouts.

90
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:27,291
-Bravo!
-Ramlal....come here.

91
00:06:27,777 --> 00:06:30,962
Look...let him go.

92
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:33,509
Go...Bravo!

93
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:42,451
And by chance...the CBl
raided Gardarilal's office.

94
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:47,495
Or on him, they found bribe monies.

95
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,552
And he was caught in Vikram's web.

96
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,301
And Vikram became yet more daring.

97
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:55,859
The case against Gardarilal began.

98
00:06:57,073 --> 00:07:00,224
This honest man was accused of
dishonesty.

99
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,534
Natwarlal did not understand...

100
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:06,436
...why this was happening to his brother.

101
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,974
Who is this Vikram?

102
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:12,434
Gardarilal wanted to cleanse
the accusations against him.

103
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,393
He wanted to showthe
real intentions.. of Vikram.

104
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,548
He knew, that if he had no proof...

105
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:20,927
the law would consider him a traitor.

106
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:24,179
He and his family would be ruined.

107
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:34,425
The age that Natwar was to learn from..
..his brother..

108
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,738
his brother was constantly worried.

109
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,506
And Gardarilal..he could not bear..
Vikram's name.

110
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:44,363
He wanted to break the signs if Vikram.

111
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:47,071
While laughing..he put his
hands on the.. sign...and...

112
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:51,369
by chance...the sign turned and moved.

113
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:54,686
He then found the hideout of Vikram.

114
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:56,540
He found the proof of his innocence.

115
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,598
But Vikram was on his way to ruin...
Gardarilal's household.

116
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:46,336
Bhabi was laying in the
hospital... unconscious.

117
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:48,204
But Natwar's eyes were on something else.

118
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:53,248
The doctor told Gadarilal that his..
wife's womb had been damaged.

119
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,957
She could never become a mother.

120
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,626
Bhabi accepted this fact..

121
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:07,842
She wiped away her tears..
She thought..my womb is not damaged..

122
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,842
God took away my womb before anyways.

123
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:13,237
She told her husband...

124
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,616
As of today...Natwar is my son!

125
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:19,412
Natwar hugged his Babhi.

126
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,896
And his Bahbi...became his mother.

127
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:48,604
Natwar...take this medal.. you had
lost yours..l have brought it for you.

128
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:51,093
Put this around your neck.

129
00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:54,806
But Natwar did not wear
the medal of.. honesty.

130
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,244
He sawthe faces of dishonesty...that...

131
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:01,311
the word of honesty he could not
understand.

132
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,859
His brother was next to him..

133
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:01,103
What are you doing in the darkness,
Natwar?

134
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:05,003
You can see the money better in the light.

135
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:09,747
We knew you'd surely come here.

136
00:12:10,386 --> 00:12:13,935
l also knew you would come
here, once l had arrived.

137
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:17,881
- You knew, and yet you came here?
- Well, l had to...

138
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,261
...l've come to be fond of you people.

139
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:23,886
Although you try to hoodwink
me in your business...

140
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,791
...your eyes give your intentions away.

141
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:31,309
Will you be able to walk out with the
money?

142
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:37,960
Yes, of course! You people
will not stop me. No...

143
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:42,305
Even if you do, Mr. Agarwal
is always there to help me.

144
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:45,600
He and his rich wife are my very old
friends.

145
00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:50,531
And you perhaps don't know, he was
already married once in the village.

146
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,060
Should this fact come to
light, he'll be sent to prison.

147
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:56,842
What say, Mr. Agarwal?...He's a pal.
He's sure to help me.

148
00:12:57,767 --> 00:13:00,156
Mr. Malhotra!
An old buddy!

149
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:05,281
Now here's a famous personality, who
figures in the who's who of society.

150
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:08,048
You intend to contest the elections, don't
you?

151
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:11,763
So what if you indulge in a few shady
deals?

152
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,380
Only l know about them.
The police know nothing.

153
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:18,307
Nowtell me, won't they
have a soft corner for me?

154
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:24,009
Yes, you're right. And why won't
they have a soft corner for you?

155
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:31,008
You knowtheir weaknesses.
So, it's impossible to stop you.

156
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:36,514
But don't forget; you are one of them, too.

157
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:41,227
You operate under the cover of dark-
ness, so that no one discovers you.

158
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:46,513
Today, however, you cannot harm us,
for we have brought darkness too.

159
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:08,965
Natwar robbed black marketeers
and smugglers and...

160
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:12,046
...and distributed their ill-gotten
wealth amongst the poor.

161
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:16,292
He told his sister-in-law
that he was a businessman.

162
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:18,922
Which is why he had to often keep
away from home on business.

163
00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:22,737
But Girdharilal knew just how
deeply his brother was involved.

164
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,949
But he couldn't bring himself
about to tell his wife about it.

165
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:28,879
Because she could never
have survived the shock.

166
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:23,132
No! No!

167
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:28,800
Don't take the sheet off...
l'm charred completely.

168
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:32,802
- Who are you?
- l'm a thief.

169
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:36,742
And why have you called me here?

170
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:42,406
l have been cheated, Natwar.

171
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:49,386
Having made me work for them, they
tried to kill me with a time-bomb.

172
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,143
That is what burnt me, too.

173
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:57,682
What are you crying about?

174
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:03,361
Before stepping into this profession,
you should've known that...

175
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:06,885
...no thief dies a natural
death, but is killed instead.

176
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:11,688
But, you too are a thief, Natwar.

177
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:17,722
Yes.
But l know what l'm heading for.

178
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:21,704
To begin with, l will never
let such an occasion arise...

179
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:26,817
But if that happens, Natwar's eyes
will never be filled with tears.

180
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:32,786
l know you are brave. And that
is why l have called you here.

181
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:40,004
There is a very expensive
necklace in Mr. Fakirchand's safe.

182
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,601
l was assigned the task of stealing it and...

183
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:47,933
...rushing it to the Chandanpur
border by the 10th.

184
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:55,585
But l cannot do that, in my present
condition.

185
00:17:56,966 --> 00:18:03,360
Please do me the favor of stealing
it and reaching it to Chandanpur.

186
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:11,394
lf it doesn't get there by the 10th...
that man is so dangerous that...

187
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:18,123
...he'll ferret me out and kill me.
Please do this favor for me.

188
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:23,660
You're knocking on the wrong door.
l've never worked for anyone before.

189
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,249
l'm in deep trouble!
Please help me.

190
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:34,811
l'm feeling sorry for you. Keep
this...you won't starve to death.

191
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:39,715
l don't need money! l need your support.

192
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:48,573
Okay. l'd rather kill myself than
die at the hands of Vikram Singh.

193
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:50,661
Wait !

194
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,117
Who is this Vikram?

195
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:00,049
Vikram is a dangerous criminal.

196
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:05,526
- ls he the who was with Micky?
- Yes. But Micky is dead !

197
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,309
Okay. l'll take that necklace
and go to Chandanpur.

198
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:53,136
Wonderful! You pretended to
die, and had Vikram trapped!

199
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:59,819
lt will be wonderful only
when Natwar kills Vikram.

200
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:04,785
Because that bastard has spread
a dangerous trap in Chandanpur.

201
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:08,123
Natwarlal's genius will outwit all those
traps.

202
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:12,095
l've made no mistake in suggesting
Natwarlal's name to you.

203
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:18,307
Do one thing, Fakirchand.
Announce an auction of that necklace.

204
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:24,267
l want to see Natwar stealing it in
the presence of so many others.

205
00:20:26,582 --> 00:20:29,130
This is the necklace l was speaking about.

206
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,835
You must have seen and bought
several priceless necklaces.

207
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:34,597
But this necklace is a
virtual vase of diamonds!

208
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:40,581
Speak up, gentlemen!
Quote your price.

209
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,652
25 lakhs!

210
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:45,652
Are you serious about
buying a diamond necklace!

211
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:50,654
- 10 million!
- Good! That's a good start.

212
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,549
- Yes...you said something...
- 10 million and a hundred thousand.

213
00:20:57,313 --> 00:20:59,463
- 1.5...
- Million!

214
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:05,605
The necklace is gradually
coming in your direction!

215
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:10,588
Raj! What's the matter?

216
00:21:15,164 --> 00:21:16,074
Oh really!?

217
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:20,984
Friends, looks like we'll have
to call off the auction today.

218
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:25,525
You'll be pleased to knowthat
on hearing of this auction...

219
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:31,983
...Mr. Ford from America, Sophia Loren
from ltaly and the Duke of France...

220
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:33,936
...are all coming here.

221
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:36,618
No! He could even be 'luke' for all l care.

222
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,736
l'm willing to pay Rs.5 lakh more
than whatever price they quote...

223
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:42,464
...but please let me have that necklace.

224
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:46,838
l appreciate your sentiments. But l
need to be excused till tomorrow.

225
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:50,811
Please try to understand my plight.

226
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:03,810
Friends, this safe will now
be opened only tomorrow.

227
00:22:04,913 --> 00:22:06,414
Will you keep that expensive
necklace in this kind of a safe!

228
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:11,382
What ! Do you think this is an ordinary
safe?!

229
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:15,179
But, still...will our expensive
necklace be safe in it?

230
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:19,400
Oh sir!...you, too!

231
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:27,355
Friends, l invite all experts in safe-
opening tomorrow before the auction.

232
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:34,398
l will personally give a reward of Rs
10,000 to anyone who opens the safe!

233
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:39,219
ln that case, l too will come tomorrow.

234
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:43,497
So....you'll go tomorrow.

235
00:22:45,387 --> 00:22:46,775
And if l don't go?

That you knowvery well.

237
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:53,039
And you also knowthat l... won't let you go.

238

-Why?
-What's my fault?

239
00:22:55,797 --> 00:23:01,064
-Fault?
Your fault starts at the beginning.

240
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:04,365
You've seen the necklace.

241
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,683
And yes...you were ready to buy it.

242
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:10,122
-For 1.5 million.
-He did not sell it.

243
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,500
-l see..
-Otherwise you would have bought it.

244
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:16,731
-So what are your plans now?
-What plans can l have?

245
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:19,119
lt was such a beautiful thing.. l went to see
it.

246
00:23:19,655 --> 00:23:24,479
lf you go to Agra..you see the Taj..
Akbar's Killa..

247
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:26,162
Now you will see the jail!

248
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:28,414
Understand!

249
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:30,704
Anyway's...you are seeing dreams.

250
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,665
We will see!

251
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,996
For years you have slipped
through.. my fingers.

252
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:41,295
But now l have all the proof.

253
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:46,826
And if l don't send you to jail for 2 year...
my name won't be lnspector Gardarilal!

254
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:52,726
lnspector!..That's the man!

255
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:55,495
Oh!...So that's the man!

256
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:58,688
You might have recognized him..
Mr. Natwarlal.

257
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:04,038
lnspector..these day's l help the poor.. and
helpless, how many faces can l recognize?

258
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,240
They are not poor people...but smugglers!

259
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:09,811
Oh!..By their face they look like beggars!

260
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,981
-Shut up!
-Then what happened?

261
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,036
He threatened me at Silver Beach last..
night!

262
00:24:15,611 --> 00:24:16,635
-What time?
-8:00

263
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:18,993
And he started saying he's a...
ClD lnspector!

264
00:24:20,282 --> 00:24:22,147
So now your also a ClD lnspector.

265
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:25,963
-Then?...
-He put my merchandise in my car...

266
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:28,105
Take him away.

267
00:24:29,992 --> 00:24:32,938
-You're smiling!
-l feel like laughing hard...but

268
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,294
l go on by smiling.

269
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:36,819
Where are the goods?

270
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:42,081
-What goods?
-The goods you stole!

271
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:44,050
Give me some sugar.

272
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:48,074
Hey Natwarlal..you scared the.. hell out of
me!

273
00:24:48,577 --> 00:24:51,319
-Was looking for you all over.
-Found out you're here.

274
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:53,917
-You?
-How are you inspector Saab?

275
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:56,897
You forgot?

276
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,628
Yesterday evening you made
plans.. to build a factory.

277
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:01,862
Last night he was at Silver Beach!

278
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:03,279
What are you saying!

279
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,579
He was with me from 7-10 PM!

280
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:08,884
-Let's go..
-Quickly let me know of the plans.

281
00:25:09,331 --> 00:25:11,834
Commissioner Saab
needs to go to.. a meeting.

282
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:13,470
What time is the meeting?

283
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:14,972
5:00 in the evening.

284
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:20,751
-And your solid proof?
-Anyways.

l couldn't finish the tea..
l'll come again for lunch.

286
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:26,530
Come Setji!

287
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:34,977
You need something from me?

288
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:38,219
-Yes...
-l did what you told me to do right?

289
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:40,064
Now you'll forgive me?

290
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:42,156
The affair with the secratary..

291
00:25:42,598 --> 00:25:43,906
you won't tell my wife.

292
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:46,870
Who's wife?

293
00:25:47,736 --> 00:25:48,725
-What secratary?...
-Who are you?

294
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:52,389
l'm Damdas.

295
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,524
You don't know me?

296
00:25:55,844 --> 00:25:56,993
No l don't know you.

297
00:25:57,446 --> 00:25:58,435
You don't know me?

298
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:04,084
Okay...you don't know
me... you don't know me!

299
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:25,956
-Wow!
-How did you know l wanted aloo pratha!

300
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:28,122
We'll...l was thinking of you.

301
00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:29,273
And you're here?

302
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:31,246
You remembered me...and here l am!

303
00:26:31,847 --> 00:26:33,348
Look how you're sweating!

304
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:38,334
l'm grown up... and you still worry about
me!

305
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:42,093
Grown up...but your
maturity is.. still like a kid!

306
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:43,685
Don't talk about maturity!

307
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,237
My maturity has made me what l am.

308
00:26:49,765 --> 00:26:55,670
American's are willing to give me..
5 million for my picture!

309
00:26:56,304 --> 00:26:58,295
And l said 5 million?

310
00:26:58,707 --> 00:27:00,607
lf the French are willing to.. give 8 million..

311
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:02,045
why should l accept 5 million?

312
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:04,151
-And you're saying...
-That's enough....eat your food..

313
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:10,994
Bhabi..you're food could be 15
days.. old and l would still eat it.

314
00:27:11,852 --> 00:27:13,433
What are you saying?

315
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:15,377
You don't even know!

316
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:19,101
Elders have said that by
touching.. your mothers feet..

317
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:24,815
is like being in heaven...

318
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:27,162
You talk too much!

319
00:27:27,536 --> 00:27:28,605
l talk only in front of you.

320
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:31,029
No one listens to me.

321
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,830
And brother...when he listens..
he gets angry like a chime.

322
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:37,105
There it goes.

323
00:27:38,747 --> 00:27:41,136
-Brother's here..
-Be careful...he's angry today.

324
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:43,594
Don't worry..l'll see.

325
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:51,015
Natwar came?

326
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:53,869
Didn't even step inside..already...
talking about my son!

327
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:56,216
After him 24 hours a day!

328
00:27:56,665 --> 00:27:59,088
Wow!..What an innocent you found!

329
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:02,844
And if he's innocent...figure..
the whole world is evil!

330
00:28:03,237 --> 00:28:03,953
What are you saying?

331
00:28:04,272 --> 00:28:05,500
What kind of talk about your brother!

332
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:07,775
Today it's me who's talking.

333
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:11,378
And if you here about is shenanigans..
you'll also talk about him like this!

334
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:12,643
What did he do?

335
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:14,867
He's a....

336
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,282
Please go and get my dinner..

337
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,664
l don't have time..have to go to the office!

338
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:25,342
And listen...you're not an officer..
that l have to report all about Natwar!

339
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:28,038
What report will you give?

340
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,819
l know everything...You're angry because...
her doesn't want to work as you say!

341
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:32,960
Why should he?

342
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:35,871
What have you earned from your hard
work?

343
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:38,224
He wants to do business....business!

344
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:41,904
Do you realize what
business he wants.. to do?

345
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:43,280
Business is business brother!

346
00:28:44,346 --> 00:28:46,132
And l want to do that kind of business..

347
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:47,503
that l make a little investment..

348
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:48,799
and make a little.

349
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:50,001
A little for the laborer..

350
00:28:50,418 --> 00:28:51,294
a little for Uncle Sam..

351
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:53,598
a little for god...and the rest for you!

352
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:55,783
-See!
-Get out from here!

353
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:01,864
What were you doing down there?

354
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:03,752
My hanky fell..

355
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,860
l was.....

356
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,597
lf your hanky keep falling...

357
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,460
you will also fall like that!
And you won't be able to pick yourself up!

358
00:29:12,874 --> 00:29:14,341
Next time l'll tie a thread.. it won't fall.

359
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:17,527
Sit.

360
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:20,775
You sit.

361
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:23,925
-l said sit!
-How can l sit when you're standing up?

362
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,661
See how he respects you?

363
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:27,257
Will you leave or not?

364
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:28,899
Go from here!

365
00:29:32,694 --> 00:29:34,321
l know how much he respects!

366
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:39,254
-Look Natwar..
-Yes?

367
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:43,109
l'll give you your last warning.

368
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:45,573
last time you gave me your last warning?

369
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:51,418
Get that necklace out of
your mind.. understand?

370
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:54,414
-Necklace?
-What necklace?

371
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:57,752
-Oh!..That necklace..
-l'm purchasing that for Bhabi.

372
00:29:58,253 --> 00:29:59,675
Look...it's been so long...

373
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:02,464
you couldn't even buy Bhabi a.. gold
necklace.

374
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:05,429
And l'll buy Bhabi a great
necklace.. right Bhabi?

375
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,815
Will you wear it?

376
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:10,141
How can l wear such a necklace... at this
age?

377
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:12,179
Bring it...l'll put it on... my daughter in law.

378
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:14,462
Put it on the Daughter ln Law later...

379
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:16,303
...first bring the food!

380
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,443
Look Natwar...That necklace is so...
valuable..

381
00:30:21,843 --> 00:30:24,107
the one who steals it will
spend.. at least 10 years in jail.

382
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,031
10 years?...No my business
won't take 10 years!

383
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,395
Not even 10 months...10 days!

384
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:33,287
ln 10 day's..exporting will start..
money will start rolling in...

385
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:37,226
Go for it! Do what you want...
l'll see how he stops you!

386
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,347
-Look!
-What?

387
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,648
When l try to lecture him...
you always interfere!

388
00:30:44,065 --> 00:30:45,373
-Why shouldn't l?
-lsn't he my son?

389
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:47,758
Calling him son...you've spoiled him!

390
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:50,036
Now he has become bad!

391
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:51,396
-What does he do that's bad?
-Ask him!

392
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:00,230
See!....He took off!

393
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:03,865
He even ate the Pratha's!

394
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:05,777
Now what will l eat?

395
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:11,102
Yes!
Try your best! Very good!

396
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:15,163
Succeed and take away a reward of Rs.10,
000 !

397
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:18,440
Oh! So, you too have failed to open it.

398
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:26,051
l had already said it's impossible to
open this safe! lt's simply unique!

399
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:29,159
lt is possible, since l still
haven't tried my hand at it.

400
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:33,126
Sure! Every expert will be
given a chance to try his luck!

401
00:31:41,122 --> 00:31:42,384
You will not go there.

402
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,907
But why, lnspector!

403
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:50,051
Because this safe holds
a very precious necklace.

404
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,949
And it is our duty to guard the necklace.

405
00:31:53,468 --> 00:31:57,700
Your duty begins only after the safe is
opened.

406
00:31:58,306 --> 00:32:00,934
But you don't happen to knowthis man. He
is...

407
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:04,037
- Yes, go on!
- He will not say anything.

408
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:22,521
This will just not open!

409
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,027
No one can open this safe.

410
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:36,950
Friends...l will now open this safe!

411
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,997
This way...and this, and a little of...

412
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:01,691
- What's that! Let me pray!
- Pray to Him?

413
00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:04,879
How often have l told you not to
talk nonsense in His presence?

414
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:09,565
Some God that one!
He stole butter as a child...

415
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:11,585
...and got caught.
And you're now appeasing him!

416
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:16,477
Don't say that! lt's a sin! Bowto
him and beg for his forgiveness.

417
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,969
Apologize to him! Why? What does
He have, that l do not?

418
00:34:23,351 --> 00:34:25,137
Stop it now...
For my sake!

419
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:27,483
Okay... l won't say anything.

420
00:34:28,756 --> 00:34:32,749
l'm quiet, only because
she asked me to be. Else...

421
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:34,310
You will never learn.
And why are you here?

422
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:38,413
l am leaving.

423
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:41,148
- Are you leaving again?
- Yes.

424
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:45,415
Look, your grouse is that l
always go far away from you.

425
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:48,410
But today l'm leaving for the last time.

426
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,035
The need to leave you will never arise
again.

427
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:53,816
l'll always be here... close to you.

428
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:56,869
- But where are you going?
- To Chandanpur.

429
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:02,363
- Have you asked your brother?
- No. Don't say anything to him.

430
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:03,634
Else, everything will be ruined.

431
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:05,992
Okay, l won't say anything.
But take His blessings.

432
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:07,828
That's actually why l came here.
Now bless me quickly!

433
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:16,280
l very well knowthat you are
aware of his whereabouts.

434
00:35:16,938 --> 00:35:19,759
Don't shout! You're a policewoman!
Why don't you find him yourself?

435
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,990
When your own brother is a
foe, how can you blame others?

436
00:35:53,942 --> 00:35:56,490
l know, brother, l've caused you a lot of
pain...

437
00:35:58,613 --> 00:36:04,006
...but l'm now going to fight the battle...

438
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:06,906
...for which l have waited for 20 years now.

439
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:14,712
l'm going to battle the devil,
who took me away from you...

440
00:36:15,096 --> 00:36:16,518
...who stole my honesty and integrity.

441
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:21,520
l am leaving to fight that very battle.

442
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:28,671
l will return, only if l have triumphed.

443
00:36:31,112 --> 00:36:32,852
With my honesty and integrity restored to
me.

444
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:39,042
l'll return as the same
old Natwar...your Natwar.

445
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:42,855
So, Natwar did fall for my trap.

446
00:36:44,225 --> 00:36:47,297
Do one thing; wait at the
border of Chandanpur...

447
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:51,471
...keep a vigil on both of them.

448
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,089
They will try to kill each other.

449
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,359
Look for an opportunity, and report to me.

450
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:00,214
We'll kill both of them.
Get going now.

451
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:05,808
Neither Natwar nor Vikram
will survive...Only Micky will.

452
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:11,286
And the diamond-mines
will belong only to me!

453
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:15,410
Mobilize your forces from now itself.

454
00:37:18,393 --> 00:37:19,655
So much of hatred!

455
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:26,157
Only 20 years ago, you were said to
be best of friends in the underworld.

456
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:28,959
How did that friendship
then turn into enemity?

457
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:32,650
''Greed'' is the only cause
for that to have happened.

458
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:38,193
20 years ago, when we fled the nation...

459
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,422
...Vikram was in dire straits.

460
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,960
lt was l who helped him in those days.

461
00:37:45,586 --> 00:37:50,660
But do you know how he repaid me,
once he turned rich and powerful?

462
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:53,638
This is what he gave me in return.

463
00:37:54,696 --> 00:37:55,720
What is this, Mr. Micky?

464
00:37:57,865 --> 00:38:05,897
This is a sign you will find on the
backs of all residents of Chandanpur.

465
00:38:07,508 --> 00:38:13,333
He has spread the terror
of the tiger in that area...

466
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:16,104
...and has turned every man into his slave.

467
00:38:22,957 --> 00:38:25,744
Well done! Continue to bring
2 or 3 people at a time.

468
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,876
Very soon, the whole village
will have assembled here.

469
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:32,651
Take them away and put them to work.

470
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:37,077
lf you wish, we could bring
the whole village here, sir.

471
00:38:37,472 --> 00:38:40,020
No...
Never make that mistake.

472
00:38:40,908 --> 00:38:45,459
Do that and you will set the
B.S.F. on a hunt for them.

473
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,748
Bring 2 or 3 men at a time...

474
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:53,005
...and the villagers will think
they were hunted by the tiger.

475
00:39:57,919 --> 00:40:00,865
Please do something, Chief...
What a calamity has befallen us!

476
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:04,235
ln just two months, that man-eater
has preyed on 300 people.

477
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,362
At this rate, no house here
will be spared the destruction.

478
00:40:10,765 --> 00:40:12,153
What is this calamity disaster we're facing!

479
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:15,754
People are fast running out of provisions.

480
00:40:17,572 --> 00:40:20,120
lf one steps out of his house,
the tiger preys on him.

481
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,764
And if he stays indoors, starvation kills
him.

482
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:27,446
l just don't know what to do.

483
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:34,142
l had heard of a hunter called
Avtar Singh, last year.

484
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,317
l have blocked all routes
leading to Chandanpur.

485
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:53,288
So the foolish villagers tried to
send you a message with a pigeon.

486
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:56,267
But the fools don't know that in this area...

487
00:40:56,811 --> 00:40:58,676
...even the birds can't flutter
their wings without my say so!

488
00:40:59,046 --> 00:41:02,072
And when they do, this
is what we do with them.

489
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,231
Fools! They think you've gone
to hunt the tiger for them!

490
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:14,017
They don't knowthat l've hunted
the man who was to kill the tiger!

491
00:42:15,022 --> 00:42:16,364
This is the narrow path
that leads to the village.

492
00:42:17,658 --> 00:42:20,445
Take that route and you will
reach Chandanpur in 24 hours.

493
00:44:52,113 --> 00:44:54,695
Are you...Avtar Singh?

494
00:45:02,223 --> 00:45:03,247
Are you...the hunter?

495
00:45:05,692 --> 00:45:10,322
Yes... l'm the hunter.

496
00:45:11,832 --> 00:45:15,063
The hunter has arrived!
Our prayers have been heard!

497
00:45:43,798 --> 00:45:46,904
What are you all doing? Let him
first take rest. He must be tired.

498
00:45:47,768 --> 00:45:49,713
Go away now. l'll explain our plight to him.

499
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:55,127
Chandanpur has always
been a peaceful village.

500
00:45:56,476 --> 00:45:58,057
There was no trouble ever before.

501
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:03,217
People freely moved about
to earn their livelihood.

502
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:12,104
Now it appears that devastation
has been let loose on us.

503
00:46:13,694 --> 00:46:19,405
Did you see that old woman cry?
She lost her young son.

504
00:46:21,235 --> 00:46:23,465
Did you see that young woman?
She lost her husband.

505
00:46:24,705 --> 00:46:29,654
A brother...a son...There's mourning
in every house of the village.

506
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:36,892
Destruction is what has
wrecked our peaceful existence.

507
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,821
What happened?
What's the reason?

508
00:46:41,989 --> 00:46:45,140
There's a man-eating tiger on the prowl.

509
00:46:46,961 --> 00:46:48,667
- A tiger?
- Yes.

510
00:46:51,765 --> 00:46:55,155
For some months now, there has
been this tiger stalking the village.

511
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,317
Which has spread panic all around.

512
00:47:01,008 --> 00:47:05,957
They all look to me for help.
But how can an old man help them?

513
00:47:13,254 --> 00:47:15,518
What noise is that?

514
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,333
lt's the sound of the drums beating.

515
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,966
News of your arrival is being
communicated to other villages.

516
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:24,739
We still followthis method of
communication in the village.

517
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:29,054
Rest for a while...l'll make
arrangements for your meal.

518
00:47:38,412 --> 00:47:39,913
He's beating away to glory!

519
00:47:43,951 --> 00:47:48,945
''Nattu'', my boy...!
Quietly slip away!

520
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:54,907
Else you'll get stuck with something
other than what you are here for.

521
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:02,959
Oh! So, you are here too!

522
00:48:05,205 --> 00:48:08,151
The villagers are beating the drums.
Go and help them.

523
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:15,079
Tell me one thing...
Just how relevant are you?

524
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,733
Back home, you play the flute and
fool my poor sister-in-law and...

525
00:48:20,153 --> 00:48:21,893
...you fool the villagers here
with your child-like appearance.

526
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,838
Your grin won't help!
Do something about it!

527
00:48:27,895 --> 00:48:32,889
ls it my job to kill the tiger?
Even if it is, why should l kill it?

528
00:48:34,101 --> 00:48:37,923
l could have easily bumped
off a gangster or a smuggler.

529
00:48:39,173 --> 00:48:40,674
But a tiger?!
Why should l?

530
00:48:41,841 --> 00:48:44,344
Never...no! l will not kill a tiger.

531
00:48:46,347 --> 00:48:49,214
l'm pushing off...
And l've something to tell you, too.

532
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:54,921
lf you can work a miracle, come
out of that frame...Or quietly scoot!

533
00:48:57,825 --> 00:48:59,645
l'm making arrangements for a get-away.

534
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:09,510
Stop it now.
You wish to get me killed.

535
00:49:10,804 --> 00:49:17,755
Where do l get away from...?
The place is a virtual puzzle.

536
00:49:19,513 --> 00:49:21,663
And that silly Vikram had
to come here of all places!

537
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,420
He could have chosen Paris or
London...The fool came here instead!

538
00:49:27,687 --> 00:49:35,082
Where is it?
Run, Nattu-boy! Scurry away!

539
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,895
Shanno, run!

540
00:50:11,732 --> 00:50:12,881
Don't chase the tiger unarmed!

541
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:19,498
Bloody nut!
What were you getting into ?!

542
00:50:33,486 --> 00:50:38,037
For the first time today, the tiger
went away without killing anyone.

543
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,208
You have come to this village, not
as a human being, but as an angel.

544
00:50:47,234 --> 00:50:50,704
Don't ever desert us... don't
ever desert the helpless!

545
00:50:53,707 --> 00:50:57,859
l'm very much here, aren't l?
What are you worried about then?

546
00:50:58,912 --> 00:51:00,857
Come, let's go.

547
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:15,093
Mr. Micky has chosen the right man.
Let's see what he does.

548
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:22,834
l should stay back here.

549
00:51:25,104 --> 00:51:28,528
Today is the 8th...l'll meet Vikram on the
10th.

550
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:36,949
After l kill him, l'll tell the
villagers to deal with the beast.

551
00:51:42,356 --> 00:51:47,020
Thank you very much.
You saved my life...

552
00:51:48,328 --> 00:51:54,119
That's alright...but you'd better be
careful. Tigers are very romantic...

553
00:51:55,269 --> 00:51:58,659
...they just can't resist a beauty.

554
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,865
Why are you worried? l mean, till l'm
here, it won't dare to come near you.

555
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:23,897
He's a mute...that's his way
of expressing his happiness.

556
00:52:25,131 --> 00:52:26,155
- A mute ?!
- Yes.

557
00:52:27,668 --> 00:52:30,614
He used to stay in the village behind the
hills.

558
00:52:31,537 --> 00:52:34,279
When the tiger ravaged their
village, we gave him shelter.

559
00:52:40,981 --> 00:52:41,970
He's a good marksman.

560
00:52:43,983 --> 00:52:52,459
But l killed Avtar Singh. Where
did his incarnation surface from?

561
00:52:53,593 --> 00:52:55,982
But he claims to be
Avtar Singh himself.

562
00:52:58,699 --> 00:53:01,805
Go and find out who this man is, Zimbo.

563
00:53:04,238 --> 00:53:05,944
What a weird place you've found
for yourself, Vikram Singh!

564
00:53:07,674 --> 00:53:10,063
A dense forest...with neither
man nor a soul around...

565
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,906
...man there is!

566
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:29,763
ls this a ''no-entry'' zone?
That's okay. l'll take this route.

567
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:44,363
Wonderful!...First, greet each
other and get acquainted.

568
00:53:45,178 --> 00:53:49,126
Become thick friends and then foes,
and then hit me...that makes sense.

569
00:53:49,983 --> 00:53:53,134
You just can't go around
bashing up everyone in sight!

570
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:02,922
Where have l landed !

571
00:54:05,532 --> 00:54:09,320
Hey!
What are you doing?

572
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:19,651
Are you educated? lf not, have
you at least ''seen'' a school?!

573
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,194
Just a minute.

574
00:54:59,753 --> 00:55:02,620
Hey mister?
Care to look this way?

575
00:55:05,158 --> 00:55:06,625
Aren't you really a human-being?

576
00:55:07,394 --> 00:55:09,294
lf you cannot fall, you can
at least shake, can't you!

577
00:55:11,064 --> 00:55:16,297
Did l say something offensive? Will
you fling me on the tree again?

578
00:55:18,772 --> 00:55:20,512
Mr. Wrestler...l hope you aren't put to
trouble.

579
00:55:23,777 --> 00:55:24,732
Tell me, who are you?

580
00:55:25,712 --> 00:55:30,103
With my head stuck in the sky and
my body suspended in thin-air...

581
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:33,232
...you're asking me for my name! l
don't even remember my address!

582
00:55:41,928 --> 00:55:43,475
- Nowtell me!
- What should l tell you?

583
00:55:43,864 --> 00:55:45,570
- Who are you?
- And who're you to ask me that!

584
00:55:47,367 --> 00:55:50,871
Did l ask you why you're
so repulsive and ugly?

585
00:55:53,707 --> 00:55:56,130
Or what is your name...or
that of your father's ?

586
00:55:57,244 --> 00:55:59,747
Whether you had a father or not.
lf you did, then why did you?!

587
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,425
And if you didn't have one, then
how did you happen to be...?

588
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,020
Didn't l tell you you'd get hurt?

589
00:56:18,764 --> 00:56:19,913
You see, there's no bitterness
or enemity between us.

590
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:29,063
Now come one!...
Better watch out...! l'll hit you!

591
00:56:34,114 --> 00:56:37,106
Hey! This broke into two!

592
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:43,483
lt used to be this big...
and now...half of it...well...

593
00:56:44,558 --> 00:56:45,980
You've got it all right in there.

594
00:56:47,226 --> 00:56:54,257
l think, it would be in my interests,
to quietly run away from here!

595
00:56:57,404 --> 00:56:58,746
Stop here...

596
00:57:01,107 --> 00:57:03,291
A quicksand ahead and the
wrestler hot on my heels!

597
00:57:07,414 --> 00:57:09,484
Save me! Help!

598
00:57:10,283 --> 00:57:13,514
- So, you did fall in it, eh?
- Pull me out, please!

599
00:57:14,254 --> 00:57:17,326
Why should l, huh? Once you're
out, you'll ask for my name again!

600
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,781
l won't. l really won't!

601
00:57:20,794 --> 00:57:23,695
- And what if you do?
- You can throw me back into this!

602
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,634
Yes.
That sounds reasonable.

603
00:57:27,968 --> 00:57:29,754
But, heh! Who's going to
carry am Amazon like you?!

604
00:57:30,337 --> 00:57:32,123
- Now wait, till l arrange something.
- Hurry up!

605
00:57:34,674 --> 00:57:35,663
Here, hold on to this!

606
00:57:44,618 --> 00:57:47,166
lt broke!
This is no man. He's a bulldozer!

607
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:54,599
Please save me!

608
00:57:57,864 --> 00:58:00,207
This looks too sturdy. l'll take this one
instead.

609
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:09,151
Here, nowtake this!

610
00:58:11,244 --> 00:58:14,748
Where did he go?
Hey, Wrestler!

611
00:58:22,289 --> 00:58:27,443
l think he's sunk.
He simply spoilt my clothes.

612
00:58:35,602 --> 00:58:37,308
This path leads to the border.

613
00:58:45,145 --> 00:58:49,047
So, this is the border. And that
fool has to come from here.

614
00:58:52,953 --> 00:58:57,344
But why was that wrestler after my life?

615
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,451
The burnt man was to arrive. But l
did. That too, two days in advance.

616
00:59:06,332 --> 00:59:08,197
Anyway, l might as well hang
around for 2 days and see!

617
00:59:37,964 --> 00:59:40,785
The hunter has come! Run !

618
00:59:47,674 --> 00:59:50,700
Look who has come!

619
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:00,599
Come to me children...
l'll tell you a story today.

620
01:00:02,022 --> 01:00:03,364
Do you want to hear the story about the
tiger?

621
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,509
Go, my son.

622
01:04:39,198 --> 01:04:44,352
He easily killed Zimbo and now he's
become friendly with the villagers.

623
01:04:45,872 --> 01:04:47,658
Who is this man? ls he here on a picnic?

624
01:04:48,107 --> 01:04:50,849
- l'll kill him, if you wish.
- Don't ever make that mistake.

625
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:55,659
lf he's a cop or from the
BSF, they'll attack this place.

626
01:04:59,652 --> 01:05:00,641
- Just do one thing.
- Yes ?

627
01:05:02,488 --> 01:05:04,638
There's a BSFoutpost,
60 miles from here.

628
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:08,526
Go there and find out whether
this man belongs to them.

629
01:05:09,028 --> 01:05:10,768
-l'll inform you by tomorrow evening.
- And wait...

630
01:05:13,399 --> 01:05:16,584
lnstruct Gunga (the mute) at
Chandanpur to search his place.

631
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:33,376
We won't let him get away.
Go and tell him...

632
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,146
...that you've taken his heart,
and given your own to him.

633
01:05:38,157 --> 01:05:41,058
Speak about him and he's here!

634
01:06:00,813 --> 01:06:02,838
What are they giggling for?
Are they getting tickled?

635
01:06:05,885 --> 01:06:08,115
Hey! At least tell me.

636
01:06:09,689 --> 01:06:12,317
Why are you running away?
Tell me.

637
01:06:12,725 --> 01:06:13,521
- No...
- So, won't you tell him?

638
01:06:14,127 --> 01:06:15,628
See what we do with him then!

639
01:11:09,355 --> 01:11:12,904
- Go in.
- No. l won't.

640
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,483
How won't you go in?
Go and express your love for him.

641
01:11:28,808 --> 01:11:30,912
Till nowthey kept asking for my
name. Nowthey ransack my place too!

642
01:11:33,646 --> 01:11:40,040
Nattu-boy...does this Vikram stay nearby?

643
01:11:42,221 --> 01:11:43,051
Welcome!

644
01:11:46,525 --> 01:11:47,321
Do you have some work?

645
01:11:48,994 --> 01:11:50,814
May l set your room right?

646
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:54,164
Not right now. l'm very angry just now.

647
01:11:54,867 --> 01:11:56,448
- May l set that right too?
- What?

648
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:59,315
l mean, do you want me to
press your head for you?

649
01:11:59,672 --> 01:12:04,143
No. l press my own hands, feet,
head and neck. Thank you!

650
01:12:04,477 --> 01:12:07,264
Now please leave. lf people
see us, what would they think?

651
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:12,271
What do you mean by what would they?
They're already saying it.

652
01:12:12,718 --> 01:12:16,666
- Now what are they saying?
- Just that, l'm your...beloved.

653
01:12:17,123 --> 01:12:22,072
...and that my entire life shall be at your
feet.

654
01:12:22,528 --> 01:12:23,597
What nonsense are you talking!

655
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,392
Get up.

656
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:29,589
Well now, is it because of that song...

657
01:12:30,269 --> 01:12:34,296
l only thought it was your festival
and joined you...don't get ideas!

658
01:12:34,807 --> 01:12:37,355
- Now get going.
- Please don't say that. l am...

659
01:12:38,377 --> 01:12:42,450
You seem to have hung on!
Now listen to this carefully.

660
01:12:43,215 --> 01:12:47,879
Don't ever get involved with me.
l'm a free-bird...never at one place.

661
01:12:48,421 --> 01:12:50,525
You'll only regret it, if
you get involved with me.

662
01:12:51,056 --> 01:12:53,957
Neither do l have a place at
my feet, nor do l need a lover.

663
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:57,167
Please don't say that... else, l'll kill myself.

664
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:59,939
Please go ahead! What are
you waiting here for? Get lost!

665
01:13:02,735 --> 01:13:04,999
Kill myself!....Kill myself!

666
01:13:05,538 --> 01:13:06,721
Doing what l want...Got
myself.. stuck in other matters!

667
01:13:07,673 --> 01:13:09,254
-Forgive me!
-l'm not like you.

668
01:13:09,809 --> 01:13:12,801
-Yes..A line of Girl's..
-Music is playing...and the girls are
dancing!

669
01:13:13,345 --> 01:13:14,494
l don't make girls dance.

670
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,825
l make the world dance around my fingers!

671
01:13:17,516 --> 01:13:19,097
Kill myself!

672
01:13:19,552 --> 01:13:20,507
Don't know where...

673
01:13:23,889 --> 01:13:24,878
Kill myself?

674
01:13:26,592 --> 01:13:29,743
Hey Natu..these people are crazy!

675
01:13:32,164 --> 01:13:33,665
She won't really kill herself?

676
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:36,436
Hey...where are you going?

677
01:13:37,837 --> 01:13:39,338
To commit suicide!

678
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,988
Oh god!...Suicide?

679
01:13:42,741 --> 01:13:43,696
What happened?

680
01:13:44,777 --> 01:13:47,803
What happened?

681
01:13:48,948 --> 01:13:51,576
He doesn't love me!

682
01:13:53,686 --> 01:13:57,679
l told him l'm you're caretaker..
He said l don't need a caretaker!

683
01:13:58,791 --> 01:14:01,498
l told him my life is yours.

684
01:14:02,728 --> 01:14:04,468
He said l don't need your life!

685
01:14:04,897 --> 01:14:06,125
Go ahead and commit suicide!

686
01:14:06,799 --> 01:14:08,460
Raju...l'm going to commit suicide..

687
01:14:08,868 --> 01:14:10,017
Please don't stop me!

688
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:12,517
He said kill yourself..

689
01:14:12,905 --> 01:14:13,815
..and your going to do it?

690
01:14:14,273 --> 01:14:15,023
And what else should l do?

691
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:16,237
l'll tell you..

692
01:14:16,609 --> 01:14:18,349
You were giving me a lesson then..

693
01:14:18,911 --> 01:14:20,617
That if a woman's love is true..

694
01:14:21,046 --> 01:14:22,229
it will turn a stone to a flower.

695
01:14:22,681 --> 01:14:23,557
Flower to water..

696
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:24,905
And your turn..

697
01:14:25,918 --> 01:14:27,021
neither flower nor water!

698
01:14:27,653 --> 01:14:29,962
Your endeavors are making my stomach
turn!

699
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:32,970
And my heart is broken..you don't even
care!

700
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:34,747
Your stomach is broken...your worried!

701
01:14:35,127 --> 01:14:36,867
Your heart is not broken.. he loves you!

702
01:14:37,296 --> 01:14:38,763
No he doesn't love me!

703
01:14:39,365 --> 01:14:40,673
-No one love you?
-No!

704
01:14:41,033 --> 01:14:42,216
Then look...there he comes.

705
01:14:46,572 --> 01:14:48,961
You hide and watch the drama.

706
01:14:49,575 --> 01:14:51,315
-Hide!
-Go!

707
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,607
Hey Rajo..
Did you see her?

708
01:14:59,218 --> 01:15:05,293
-What is it?..What happened?
-Shanno fell from there!

709
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:12,625
What?...

710
01:15:13,165 --> 01:15:14,666
What are you saying?

711
01:15:15,534 --> 01:15:18,002
You don't believe me..

712
01:15:18,571 --> 01:15:20,516
..then see for yourself!

713
01:15:43,262 --> 01:15:47,084
At that time l was only kidding..

714
01:15:48,734 --> 01:15:50,076
..but now l'm not kidding.

715
01:15:52,338 --> 01:15:55,080
l am that free man who never sits.

716
01:15:57,109 --> 01:15:58,371
l have no homestead.

717
01:15:59,712 --> 01:16:01,976
l am one of those that have no..

718
01:16:02,848 --> 01:16:05,999
..love..loving...nothing.

719
01:16:08,354 --> 01:16:09,935
Don't look for dreams for me.

720
01:16:11,023 --> 01:16:12,365
They will break for you.

721
01:16:14,026 --> 01:16:15,414
l can't give you anything.

722
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:20,916
All will happen...and you will.. receive
nothing.

723
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:29,781
-lt's OK..
-Please forgive me.

724
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,091
l was mistaken.

725
01:16:34,647 --> 01:16:34,920
Now l will never meet you again..

726
01:16:37,116 --> 01:16:38,617
Never!

727
01:16:46,358 --> 01:16:51,068
So you found nothing in his
room. l cannot take any risk.

728
01:16:52,831 --> 01:16:54,696
l cannot leave this diamond
of mine and go out.

729
01:16:57,036 --> 01:17:02,542
The drums saved him the last
time. l'll see how he escapes now.

730
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:34,076
Six decades ago, a mendicant
came here as an angel..

731
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,787
...and it looks as if that
angel has returned in you.

732
01:18:40,305 --> 01:18:44,127
You have brought us the message of life.

733
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:49,417
You have not only saved my
daughter, but also my life.

734
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:55,738
Foolish people! What did l do? l
barely managed to survive myself!

735
01:18:57,656 --> 01:18:59,806
Or l'd almost had it today!

736
01:19:02,294 --> 01:19:07,448
And excuse me!
You've done nothing, too!

737
01:19:09,268 --> 01:19:10,530
You're smiling, are you?

738
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:16,530
What are you doing here?

739
01:19:21,446 --> 01:19:23,232
Speak up!
Don't act dumb.

740
01:19:25,584 --> 01:19:27,006
- Herbs.
- What herbs?

741
01:19:28,353 --> 01:19:30,617
For your wounds.

742
01:19:31,089 --> 01:19:31,999
Then apply it.

743
01:19:37,429 --> 01:19:38,179
Come on.

744
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:42,616
Hurry up.

745
01:19:47,339 --> 01:19:50,490
Sit down... now apply it.

746
01:19:55,414 --> 01:19:56,085
Gently.

747
01:19:58,684 --> 01:19:59,708
Apply some here, too.

748
01:20:07,092 --> 01:20:07,683
Come closer.

749
01:20:09,561 --> 01:20:10,311
Rest your head here.

750
01:20:19,805 --> 01:20:22,353
Hey, what happened?
Shanno, no...

751
01:20:26,378 --> 01:20:29,085
So, you have accepted me, haven't you?

752
01:20:30,749 --> 01:20:34,014
l'm surprised. l've seen many
types of people in the world...

753
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,787
...that l couldn't believe in your love for
me.

754
01:20:38,957 --> 01:20:40,379
You do believe me now, don't you?

755
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:45,369
lf l hadn't, l'd have told
you so at the door itself...

756
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:07,812
Now l want to see my Shano..
become queen Shano.

757
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:11,009
From head to toe..diamonds.

758
01:21:11,757 --> 01:21:14,863
The worlds most beautiful queen.

759
01:21:15,794 --> 01:21:21,061
Style your hair in Paris..clothes..
from America..marriage in London!

760
01:21:21,533 --> 01:21:23,717
And we will take our Buffaloes with us.

761
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:28,155
-Buffaloes?
-l've heard the milk in the cities is not
good.

762
01:21:28,674 --> 01:21:30,699
-We'll take the buffaloes.
-The milk will be like home.

763
01:21:31,209 --> 01:21:32,278
And the butter too!

764
01:21:32,778 --> 01:21:35,485
-Do you have goats also?
-Yes two!

765
01:21:36,381 --> 01:21:39,691
-You have a plow as well?
-Yes!

766
01:21:40,152 --> 01:21:41,813
But what will we do with that?

767
01:21:42,187 --> 01:21:43,973
We'll we can also farm!

768
01:21:44,356 --> 01:21:46,506
Then the food will also be home grown!

769
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:50,097
-Oh God!
-l heard that women are dumb..

770
01:21:50,529 --> 01:21:52,394
But this dumb.. l just discovered today!

771
01:21:53,298 --> 01:21:54,526
-Why?
-What did l do?

772
01:21:54,967 --> 01:21:56,468
You think of me as a gardener..

773
01:21:56,935 --> 01:21:59,881
Think of me as a gwala..
Day and night l'll milk goats?

774
01:22:00,272 --> 01:22:02,661
-No no..
-Why you?...l'll do it!

775
01:22:03,075 --> 01:22:05,179
No..
You won't milk the goats!

776
01:22:05,577 --> 01:22:07,522
You'll milk your brain!

777
01:22:08,046 --> 01:22:11,470
l'm talking about love.. and
you're talking about goats?

778
01:22:12,684 --> 01:22:15,790
-Become stylish..
-Put a little pizzazz in your talk!

779
01:22:16,221 --> 01:22:17,449
Come here!

780
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:28,290
Hugged my love....keep on hugging
till.. l can't even see the world!

781
01:22:29,401 --> 01:22:33,906
And far away...build a
small house for ourselves.

782
01:22:34,706 --> 01:22:36,094
Where there's Bhabi, Brother, you and me.

783
01:22:43,819 --> 01:22:45,320
How come the idiot SSp has not come?

784
01:22:46,689 --> 01:22:47,792
What is he doing?

785
01:22:58,901 --> 01:23:02,132
-Chandanpur?
-What's your name?

786
01:23:02,638 --> 01:23:07,462
Sukia..
But the road to Chandanpur
is near the border.

787
01:23:08,077 --> 01:23:10,659
-What are you doing here?
-l'm thirsty.

788
01:23:11,447 --> 01:23:12,709
Can l get a little water?

789
01:23:13,249 --> 01:23:16,036
-Ram Singh!...Yes?
-This gentleman has arrived from
Chandanpur.

790
01:23:16,619 --> 01:23:19,008
-Chandanpur?
-Bring him inside!

791
01:23:21,456 --> 01:23:22,844
lnspector, bring a glass of water.

792
01:23:29,331 --> 01:23:30,434
Sit Ram Singh.

793
01:23:31,367 --> 01:23:32,391
Tell me how Chandanpur is.

794
01:23:33,535 --> 01:23:34,331
All are fine.

795
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,955
lt's been such a long time since.. you
visited...

796
01:23:38,606 --> 01:23:40,346
The whole town misses you.

797
01:23:40,943 --> 01:23:42,171
l also remember a lot.

798
01:23:43,379 --> 01:23:46,121
Yes but it will be 3 months
before.. you visit again.

799
01:23:47,816 --> 01:23:51,001
3 months?..Yes..he has
to build a border.. post.

800
01:24:09,138 --> 01:24:12,881
For four months now, neither the
BSFnor the police can come here.

801
01:24:13,976 --> 01:24:18,879
l'm the Uncrowned King around
here! l can do just as l please!

802
01:24:25,354 --> 01:24:27,902
Bring people from Sholapur,
Chandanpur, Kashipur...everywhere!

803
01:24:29,525 --> 01:24:33,871
Every hidden diamond must be found.
l want to be the world's richest man.

804
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:10,825
- What happened?
- A new problem!

805
01:25:11,667 --> 01:25:14,056
Some men, astride their horses,
forcibly carried our people away.

806
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:17,220
- Riders, eh?
- Yes. They went towards the valley.

807
01:25:18,607 --> 01:25:23,237
Towards the valley...but
that is where the tiger is.

808
01:25:32,087 --> 01:25:35,955
Men on horsebacks... the tiger...

809
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:42,812
...my arrival here... the necklace.

810
01:25:45,234 --> 01:25:48,783
There is a priceless necklace
in Fakirchand's safe, Natwar.

811
01:25:50,105 --> 01:25:52,494
Steal it and deliver it to Chandanpur.

812
01:25:56,645 --> 01:26:00,752
Nattu-boy!
You were fooled, weren't you?

813
01:26:02,518 --> 01:26:06,022
The necklace was a mere excuse
to trap you in Vikram's gameplan.

814
01:26:07,689 --> 01:26:10,317
The tiger and the riders both belong to
him.

815
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:17,153
lt would therefore be best to admit
your mistake and work out a solution.

816
01:26:21,336 --> 01:26:22,837
What happened?
Why are you laughing?

817
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:32,495
The fear of the tiger has
been spread in the village.

818
01:26:33,282 --> 01:26:35,432
Deliberately spread?
But who would spread it?

819
01:26:36,819 --> 01:26:38,844
- There is a devil.
- What's his name?

820
01:26:40,355 --> 01:26:45,827
Don't worry about him. l'll deal
with him later. First, catch the tiger

821
01:26:50,132 --> 01:26:54,478
Tiger! So he's planning
to catch the tiger, is he?

822
01:26:59,007 --> 01:27:01,157
He will not trap the tiger.

823
01:27:05,647 --> 01:27:09,959
l want to see your aim.

824
01:27:23,765 --> 01:27:27,155
Enough...the pit is deep enough.
Cover it with this.

825
01:27:30,772 --> 01:27:33,081
Hurry up....that's good.

826
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:43,011
What will he do with the dummy?

827
01:27:49,091 --> 01:27:51,673
ls that a dummy you've put up there?

828
01:27:52,394 --> 01:27:54,737
Yes...it's been dressed like a girl.

829
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:57,580
The tiger will take it to be
human and get trapped.

830
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:01,704
lt's a man-eater. lt won't approach,
unless it gets the human scent.

831
01:28:03,038 --> 01:28:07,907
Those people standing there...
ask them to hide behind it.

832
01:28:10,212 --> 01:28:11,793
What are you doing here?
Move away.

833
01:28:13,982 --> 01:28:21,411
A man-eater! Whom should l prepare?
Who'd be willing to give up his life?

834
01:28:24,859 --> 01:28:25,814
Well, let's see.

835
01:28:51,887 --> 01:28:53,036
Look at that dummy!

836
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:04,572
Shanno! Run !

837
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:10,880
Catch it!
Don't let it escape!

838
01:30:30,786 --> 01:30:31,935
Have a cage made for it and lock it up.

839
01:30:33,021 --> 01:30:34,727
Go home. l'll bring some medicines for
you.

840
01:30:37,626 --> 01:30:39,014
What's this? Come here.

841
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:44,576
What stupidity is this? Who asked
you to stand near the dummy?

842
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:48,374
You claim to have your world at my
feet. ls this how a lover behaves?

843
01:30:50,172 --> 01:30:51,434
Did you ask me before going there?

844
01:30:55,977 --> 01:30:59,003
lt's okay...it's good that
you went and stood there.

845
01:30:59,648 --> 01:31:01,957
How else could we have trapped
the tiger? l didn't mean it.

846
01:31:03,018 --> 01:31:05,486
- Really?
- Oh yes. How could l scold you?

847
01:32:08,984 --> 01:32:14,570
Rajjo, Shanno...don't cry, my
children. Pray to the Lord...

848
01:32:22,230 --> 01:32:23,185
What did you do?

849
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:27,984
You sacrificed your life, to save mine.

850
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:31,362
So what? l gave my life, for my son.

851
01:32:33,008 --> 01:32:36,910
You came here to banish the devil.
Don't leave without doing so.

852
01:32:38,246 --> 01:32:39,235
l am going now...

853
01:32:40,448 --> 01:32:44,714
...henceforth, the village and its
people shall live in your care.

854
01:32:54,963 --> 01:32:56,430
''l've given my life for my son''

855
01:32:57,799 --> 01:33:04,671
''Henceforth, this village and its
people shall live in your care''

856
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,590
Wait!

857
01:35:11,099 --> 01:35:12,964
Don't rejoice so much
over such a minor victory.

858
01:35:14,336 --> 01:35:15,758
The consequences could be dire
tomorrow.

859
01:35:17,272 --> 01:35:21,299
The battle has just begun.
We have to face him together.

860
01:35:22,477 --> 01:35:25,901
Use the drums and call people from
nearby villages. Prepare yourself!

861
01:35:44,132 --> 01:35:45,838
He's assembling people
from neighboring villages.

862
01:35:48,203 --> 01:35:50,068
But we have to finish him before he does
that.

863
01:36:09,824 --> 01:36:10,893
What are we to do about this fellow?

864
01:36:12,494 --> 01:36:14,121
lf he remains here, they will kill him.

865
01:36:16,131 --> 01:36:20,636
- Relax. We're thinking about you.
- Let's take him along.

866
01:36:30,345 --> 01:36:31,846
Come on. Hurry up.

867
01:36:43,925 --> 01:36:45,074
Take all your stuff up there.

868
01:36:51,332 --> 01:36:53,641
Alright!
Hey, Shanno! Come here.

869
01:36:56,537 --> 01:36:59,165
- What is it?
- Look, he too is running on top.

870
01:36:59,874 --> 01:37:04,868
Hide in some corner up there.
Or you'll be exposed.

871
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:07,962
- What is it?
- Nothing.

872
01:37:17,559 --> 01:37:18,947
You go to that side and you to this.

873
01:37:19,827 --> 01:37:20,577
Hurry up.

874
01:37:51,426 --> 01:37:52,381
Move upwards!

875
01:38:02,137 --> 01:38:03,923
Enough.
Collect all the boulders here.

876
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:39,764
Attack!

877
01:39:35,463 --> 01:39:36,373
The enemy has fled!

878
01:39:45,139 --> 01:39:48,802
No... that devil is still there.

879
01:39:49,977 --> 01:39:55,882
How long will you escape me, Vikram?
You'll surely be caught one day.

880
01:39:56,918 --> 01:39:59,227
You cannot catch him.
He's destined to die at my hands.

881
01:40:03,691 --> 01:40:05,113
Just see how l lead him to his death.

882
01:40:14,702 --> 01:40:20,891
Come quickly. Look over there.
Someone is approaching.

883
01:40:26,214 --> 01:40:29,206
Seems to be an old man. l'll go and find
out.

884
01:40:29,917 --> 01:40:32,784
- l'll come along, too.
- No. Don't you dare follow me!

885
01:40:34,055 --> 01:40:34,965
Get me a horse.

886
01:40:40,528 --> 01:40:42,029
He's asked you not to follow him, Shanno.

887
01:40:43,298 --> 01:40:44,447
Wait here.

888
01:41:40,588 --> 01:41:42,977
He's given a lot of trouble.
But not in the future.

889
01:41:50,098 --> 01:41:57,732
Remember one thing; leave so much
life in him so he can see his death.

890
01:44:07,268 --> 01:44:10,817
lf she's here, he will surely
come too. Grab her!

891
01:44:23,584 --> 01:44:26,576
Where is Shanno?
She had followed you.

892
01:44:35,429 --> 01:44:36,384
What is that noise?

893
01:44:41,202 --> 01:44:45,195
- Hello, beauty!
- Killer-looks, indeed!

894
01:49:20,347 --> 01:49:23,248
You won't listen, will you? Had l
not told you, not to follow me?

895
01:49:23,884 --> 01:49:25,511
But you will always pester me!

896
01:49:27,254 --> 01:49:30,246
- What are you grinning for?
- l know you're only joking.

897
01:49:30,691 --> 01:49:32,716
l'm not joking. l'm really very angry with
you!

898
01:49:35,328 --> 01:49:38,673
Alright. l was only joking!
You always do what is forbidden.

899
01:49:39,233 --> 01:49:48,266
Okay...l'm very serious about
what l'm about to say just now.

900
01:49:49,343 --> 01:49:53,848
Don't follow me. lf you do, l'll not
only scold you, but spank you too!

901
01:49:54,415 --> 01:49:57,361
l'll give you a sound thrashing!
Understand? Now scoot!

902
01:49:58,819 --> 01:50:00,366
Nothing will happen to me!
Go now!

903
01:50:02,323 --> 01:50:05,713
Look. l have the protection
of your 'powerful' love.

904
01:50:06,259 --> 01:50:08,807
Even the God of Death wouldn't
be able to withstand the power!

905
01:50:09,864 --> 01:50:11,092
Nothing will happen to me.
Go now.

906
01:50:11,699 --> 01:50:16,648
Not here..go there.

907
01:50:55,042 --> 01:50:59,752
What nonsense are you talking!
How did you let him go?

908
01:51:02,983 --> 01:51:09,252
l risked my life to bring him here
and you allowed him to get away!

909
01:51:13,093 --> 01:51:14,117
But who is this man?

910
01:51:15,496 --> 01:51:19,444
He's neither from the BSF, nor from the
police.

911
01:51:28,441 --> 01:51:33,595
Why has this urbanite come to a
small village like Chandanpur?

912
01:51:35,582 --> 01:51:37,812
- Who is this man?
- l am that man.

913
01:51:39,019 --> 01:51:42,728
My name is Natwar. l am lnspector
Girdharilal's younger brother.

914
01:51:43,791 --> 01:51:48,740
Remember? lnspector Girdharilal...
20 years ago...try and remember.

915
01:51:50,331 --> 01:51:54,597
l've come to settle a
20-year old score with you.

916
01:51:55,602 --> 01:51:58,912
l know you're a coward.
You wouldn't ever step out of here.

917
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:01,849
You can show your strength only
to the weak and downtrodden.

918
01:52:02,409 --> 01:52:04,149
But l will compel you to come out in the
open.

919
01:52:04,778 --> 01:52:10,683
And the day you come out...
will be the last day of your life.

920
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:55,262
Listen; Block all roads leading
to the BSFand to the city.

921
01:53:06,306 --> 01:53:09,696
So this is why he came
here from the city, did he?

922
01:53:16,650 --> 01:53:18,390
What are you thinking?

923
01:53:22,289 --> 01:53:23,631
What happened?

924
01:53:31,664 --> 01:53:33,325
l asked what happened?

925
01:53:34,234 --> 01:53:35,895
l'm beating my head against the wall!

926
01:53:36,570 --> 01:53:37,673
Why are you beating your head?

927
01:53:38,338 --> 01:53:39,362
ls there a problem?

928
01:53:39,973 --> 01:53:43,363
Tell me.. l'll pray to god and
wipe your problems away.

929
01:53:44,745 --> 01:53:46,007
God will solve my problems?

930
01:53:46,447 --> 01:53:48,711
He can't solve your problem..
How can he solve mine?

931
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:51,005
What are you saying? l'm telling the truth!

932
01:53:51,885 --> 01:53:53,466
Every morning you donate coconuts!

933
01:53:53,954 --> 01:53:55,023
What problem has he solved?

934
01:53:55,756 --> 01:53:57,621
By donating..you have raised
the price.. of coconuts!

935
01:53:58,926 --> 01:53:59,995
Don't talk like this!

936
01:54:00,394 --> 01:54:01,736
-You will be jinxed!
-No l won't!

937
01:54:02,196 --> 01:54:03,538
Sit there l'll tell you... sit sit!

938
01:54:08,001 --> 01:54:09,946
l'll tell you how l'll solve my problem!

939
01:54:10,404 --> 01:54:11,746
You keep saying yes!

940
01:54:12,306 --> 01:54:14,774
First let me say something!..
Then say yes!

941
01:54:20,581 --> 01:54:21,843
The enemy is powerful.

942
01:54:22,883 --> 01:54:26,228
Why are you quite!
Say yes!

943
01:54:28,122 --> 01:54:30,147
-lt is difficult to reach there.
-Yes.

944
01:54:30,757 --> 01:54:32,941
-Because he is surrounded by the enemy.
-Yes.

945
01:54:34,528 --> 01:54:37,474
-To break the ring is difficult.
-Yes.

946
01:54:38,432 --> 01:54:40,332
-And he does not come outside.
-Yes.

947
01:54:41,135 --> 01:54:44,366
-And why doesn't he come out?
-l what did l tell you!

948
01:54:44,737 --> 01:54:46,443
-l don't want chatter.
- Just say yes!

949
01:54:47,908 --> 01:54:49,057
Why doesn't he come outside!

950
01:54:51,378 --> 01:54:53,403
-Question is why doesn't he come out!
-Yes.

951
01:54:55,549 --> 01:54:58,291
Answer is that he doesn't
come out.. because....

952
01:54:58,918 --> 01:55:00,419
-Because he is greedy.
-Yes.

953
01:55:01,555 --> 01:55:04,581
His greediness kept him locked up.

954
01:55:07,094 --> 01:55:10,962
How can you get him out
under this.. condition.

955
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:16,268
How can you get him out
under this.. condition!!

956
01:55:18,338 --> 01:55:20,158
Don't say yes...give me an
answer.. how can he get out?

957
01:55:21,975 --> 01:55:23,966
Greediness has kept him locked up.. right?

958
01:55:24,478 --> 01:55:26,628
And if he can get out?

959
01:55:27,181 --> 01:55:28,842
His greediness will also get out.

960
01:55:30,484 --> 01:55:32,111
Shut up!

961
01:55:33,253 --> 01:55:34,402
Talking!

962
01:55:41,161 --> 01:55:46,030
Yes!...Aside from my heart...you
also.. have taken my mind!

963
01:56:14,962 --> 01:56:18,352
All points on the Terai and BSF
have been covered by our people.

964
01:56:18,899 --> 01:56:20,446
Natwar can't reach there.

965
01:56:21,368 --> 01:56:23,233
He won't go anywhere.
He'll come here directly.

966
01:56:23,637 --> 01:56:26,424
Guards have been alerted to
ensure that he can't come in.

967
01:56:39,019 --> 01:56:41,203
The devil has been lured.
He'll surely come here.

968
01:56:41,888 --> 01:56:45,153
Ramu, take care of this.

969
01:56:50,731 --> 01:56:51,914
So many of them!

970
01:57:41,515 --> 01:57:44,336
Our people were guarding
all points. l'm sure of that.

971
01:57:47,454 --> 01:57:53,245
Don't worry. l won't blame you.
l want to kill Natwar. Not you.

972
01:58:03,503 --> 01:58:08,657
How many days of food-stock are
they holding in the settlement there?

973
01:58:09,109 --> 01:58:11,930
Plenty, Mr. Vikram.
They can pull on for months.

974
01:58:12,546 --> 01:58:13,695
Months!

975
01:58:16,216 --> 01:58:20,004
You will go in there, just
like he had come in here.

976
01:58:21,788 --> 01:58:27,294
And you must throw all the
food grains down the hill.

977
01:58:29,229 --> 01:58:37,182
l'll encircle the mountain. Let's see
howthey survive on the rocks there.

978
02:00:16,937 --> 02:00:24,366
You're starving these people to death.
And the hungry can't fight Vikram.

979
02:00:25,445 --> 02:00:31,998
Don't think you've won or that l've lost,
because you've got the diamonds.

980
02:00:33,687 --> 02:00:40,035
When you're hungry, you'll
need food. Not the diamonds.

981
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:46,385
- And l have the foodstuff with me.
- lf you've been sired by a man, if...

982
02:00:47,501 --> 02:00:50,322
...you're so sure of your strength,
then let go of these poor people.

983
02:00:51,671 --> 02:00:53,138
The contest is between the two of us.

984
02:00:54,274 --> 02:00:57,346
l'll keep the diamonds there,
may the fittest snatch them!

985
02:00:58,078 --> 02:01:06,235
l don't fight with infants. l've trampled
many like you under my feet.

986
02:01:16,196 --> 02:01:17,345
What is going to happen to us now?

987
02:02:32,806 --> 02:02:36,071
The right opportunity for Micky
to eliminate both of them!

988
02:02:37,877 --> 02:02:40,539
Organize the transport
and mobilize our forces.

989
02:02:41,681 --> 02:02:44,070
We must reach Chandanpur
by nightfall, at the latest

990
02:02:47,887 --> 02:02:48,637
Stop!

991
02:02:49,322 --> 02:02:51,984
You must leave immediately, Mr. Micky.

992
02:02:52,592 --> 02:02:56,938
The police have got to know about your
plans.

993
02:02:57,430 --> 02:03:01,298
- What!
- You'd better not go to Chandanpur.

994
02:03:02,335 --> 02:03:11,733
No. l have to go to Chandanpur.
l can't lose the diamond-mine.

995
02:03:12,145 --> 02:03:16,297
- What about the police?
- l've hoodwinked them for 20 years.

996
02:03:17,884 --> 02:03:22,196
- They can do nothing!
- What of me if the police come here?

997
02:03:23,523 --> 02:03:26,469
The police is here!

998
02:03:27,627 --> 02:03:33,099
lt pleases me to meet someone
who has been dead for 20 years.

999
02:03:34,567 --> 02:03:38,389
Nowthat l have you, l can also find Vikram.

1000
02:03:52,686 --> 02:03:56,588
He may not survive.
You can interrogate him now.

1001
02:04:04,998 --> 02:04:13,190
- Micky...the diamond mine!
- Vikram.

1002
02:04:15,375 --> 02:04:16,444
Go on, Micky.

1003
02:04:26,052 --> 02:04:27,280
No.
He couldn't have done such a thing.

1004
02:04:27,687 --> 02:04:33,239
Natwar can never do this!
You're implicating him falsely!

1005
02:04:34,761 --> 02:04:40,267
So what if he was not born of me?
He's still my own son.

1006
02:04:41,034 --> 02:04:47,109
- He'll never cheat me.
- l swear it. l'm speaking the truth!

1007
02:05:00,019 --> 02:05:07,414
lt's the truth Seema. Natwar is
being hounded by the police.

1008
02:05:09,362 --> 02:05:12,263
Natwarlal, the younger brother
of lnspector Girdharilal.

1009
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:15,781
Very well. l shall also come
with you. l must get to see this.

1010
02:09:02,395 --> 02:09:11,303
Fools! He armed you, but he can't
give you a single piece of bread.

1011
02:09:15,241 --> 02:09:18,631
Not even God can send you bread.

1012
02:10:06,793 --> 02:10:16,225
Mother used to tell me that..in utter
hopelessness, desolation and ruin...

1013
02:10:18,638 --> 02:10:23,951
...when a man has nowhere
to turn to, he comes to You...

1014
02:10:36,856 --> 02:10:43,204
Because l've never faced
hopelessness and desolation.

1015
02:10:45,231 --> 02:10:59,453
But today, Natwar faces the dark and
the desolate. Please show me the way.

1016
02:11:02,148 --> 02:11:06,300
Show me some way, God, else these
poor people will die of hunger.

1017
02:12:11,884 --> 02:12:12,839
Push the cage forward.

1018
02:13:20,152 --> 02:13:21,221
Run down the slope!

1019
02:14:30,289 --> 02:14:31,517
l knew it, till you are here,
we'll never go hungry.

1020
02:14:36,262 --> 02:14:39,413
Not me. lt's the handiwork of the Lord.

1021
02:14:44,670 --> 02:14:47,252
Thank you, Lord.
Thank You very much.

1022
02:18:13,846 --> 02:18:16,792
A BSFforce seems to be here.

1023
02:18:21,987 --> 02:18:23,215
Find out whey they are here!

1024
02:18:52,351 --> 02:19:00,622
lnspector Girdharilal!...Natwar,
your brother has come here too.

1025
02:19:02,294 --> 02:19:04,524
By tomorrow he reaches
the village with the BSF.

1026
02:19:05,965 --> 02:19:10,356
Before he does that, both you and
the diamonds will be in my clutches.

1027
02:19:17,843 --> 02:19:21,472
- Let's relax a bit.
- Till he is here, there's no danger.

1028
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,067
Look! Over there!

1029
02:20:14,999 --> 02:20:18,742
lt's a ruse from Vikram! Stop! lt's a ploy.

1030
02:20:19,772 --> 02:20:24,323
Stop! lt's a ploy!

1031
02:20:26,178 --> 02:20:27,327
Stop!

1032
02:20:28,981 --> 02:20:30,608
Don't go down there!

1033
02:20:54,573 --> 02:20:59,237
You're nothing, Natwar.
You're nothing before me.

1034
02:21:06,517 --> 02:21:08,701
Before the BSFarrive, grab each
and every one of the people.

1035
02:21:09,353 --> 02:21:11,139
And bring me the diamonds.

1036
02:21:35,581 --> 02:21:37,731
The whole village is empty.
Where have the people gone?

1037
02:21:39,318 --> 02:21:43,869
You don't know how dangerous Vikram
can be.

1038
02:21:44,857 --> 02:21:46,438
l think this may be one of his ploys.

1039
02:21:47,226 --> 02:21:50,411
Let's see...
Have the forests combed.

1040
02:21:57,202 --> 02:21:59,272
Take a platoon into the terai.

1041
02:21:59,838 --> 02:22:01,988
But what about Natwar?

1042
02:22:08,213 --> 02:22:12,206
No!
Don't beat him! Stop!

1043
02:22:13,085 --> 02:22:16,953
Dogs! Hoodlums!
Let him go!

1044
02:22:27,065 --> 02:22:32,935
The BSFis combing the forests
and may soon reach us.

1045
02:22:35,874 --> 02:22:39,742
They'll be taken care of too.
No one can nab Vikram.

1046
02:23:44,276 --> 02:23:49,384
You've been looking for me, haven't
you? So l've brought you here.

1047
02:23:50,816 --> 02:23:53,922
And Girdharilal, your brother
Natwar is here too.

1048
02:23:54,653 --> 02:23:55,722
Where is Natwar?

1049
02:24:00,359 --> 02:24:05,467
Nothing's going to happen to you.
You're going to be alright.

1050
02:24:06,965 --> 02:24:11,117
Shanno will take you out of here.
l'll take you out of here alive.

1051
02:24:13,272 --> 02:24:18,016
l'll put the world on fire, if
anything happens to you.

1052
02:24:36,561 --> 02:24:39,064
Yes.
This is enough.

1053
02:24:45,103 --> 02:24:48,891
Mine the diamond quarry

1054
02:24:50,174 --> 02:24:52,199
The BSFis slowly coming towards us.

1055
02:24:55,479 --> 02:24:57,549
-This work must be done quickly!
-ln every corner.

1056
02:25:02,688 --> 02:25:04,792
The BSFwon't make it here.

1057
02:25:07,592 --> 02:25:11,096
Captain...you're people are coming... this
way.

1058
02:25:12,030 --> 02:25:13,418
And l don't want them to get here.

1059
02:25:14,099 --> 02:25:16,920
Call your people on the wireless.

1060
02:25:17,336 --> 02:25:19,201
And tell them you checked everything.

1061
02:25:19,805 --> 02:25:20,954
Everything is fine.

1062
02:25:21,573 --> 02:25:23,564
So you can escape quickly?

1063
02:25:24,109 --> 02:25:25,531
l'm not that stupid!

1064
02:25:26,745 --> 02:25:29,646
You're not that stupid...
That's why l'm telling you.

1065
02:25:30,215 --> 02:25:34,242
Because army people to save one life..

1066
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,620
they won't lose hundreds of others.

1067
02:25:37,289 --> 02:25:38,950
And we're talking about hundreds.. of
people.

1068
02:25:39,791 --> 02:25:42,339
And if you don't listen to me..

1069
02:25:42,861 --> 02:25:44,806
-l'll shoot you all.
-You won't do that!

1070
02:25:45,897 --> 02:25:48,923
lt's too bad Captain..

1071
02:25:49,434 --> 02:25:52,585
l have to do this..and l will start.. right
here.

1072
02:25:53,672 --> 02:25:55,014
Don't move forward.

1073
02:26:06,351 --> 02:26:11,505
Veeru, go see if Captain's
people.. are doing as he says.

1074
02:26:32,377 --> 02:26:33,844
-Don't go towards Chandanpur!
-All is fine here.

1075
02:26:34,746 --> 02:26:36,896
-Should l stop them from going?
-OK sir.

1076
02:26:37,315 --> 02:26:40,261
No one will go towards the border!

1077
02:26:41,219 --> 02:26:42,607
No one will go!

1078
02:27:01,772 --> 02:27:03,592
Vikram...the BSFhas gone the other way.

1079
02:27:06,077 --> 02:27:08,625
Gardari...you've come so far..

1080
02:27:09,147 --> 02:27:10,250
go and meet your brother.

1081
02:27:10,916 --> 02:27:12,258
Veeru..take him to meet his brother.

1082
02:27:20,425 --> 02:27:22,370
Say only what l told you to say.

1083
02:27:23,461 --> 02:27:26,203
-To him..
-No!

1084
02:27:27,499 --> 02:27:28,841
l won't kill you this easy!

1085
02:27:30,135 --> 02:27:31,762
Your an army person...a man right?

1086
02:27:32,838 --> 02:27:34,021
l'll kill you like a man!

1087
02:27:43,215 --> 02:27:45,638
Don't come in. l'll kill you!

1088
02:27:53,391 --> 02:27:54,380
Don't come any closer.

1089
02:28:12,911 --> 02:28:14,219
What has happened to you, my son?

1090
02:28:19,618 --> 02:28:23,202
l've sinned all my life, Mother.
l'm trying to atone for my sins.

1091
02:28:27,192 --> 02:28:29,535
Tell me Mother, will l be
able to cleanse my soul?

1092
02:29:36,794 --> 02:29:42,983
The 20-year old story is
coming to an end, Girdharilal.

1093
02:29:45,070 --> 02:29:51,066
No one can challenge
Vikram's power or ingenuity.

1094
02:29:52,644 --> 02:29:56,546
Neither on earth, nor in Heaven.
Take for instance, your brother.

1095
02:29:57,916 --> 02:30:03,866
The fool came to kill Vikram. Now he
has also brought you to your death!

1096
02:30:04,689 --> 02:30:07,237
- What about us, Mr. Vikram?
- What can l do?

1097
02:30:08,727 --> 02:30:13,596
l don't need you people any
more. l've got what l wanted.

1098
02:30:14,733 --> 02:30:17,395
And l destroy those l don't want.

1099
02:30:18,003 --> 02:30:18,753
You cheat!

1100
02:30:26,244 --> 02:30:29,145
You're about to die, Natwar.

1101
02:30:29,881 --> 02:30:33,066
Were you destined to live, l'd
have said, ''See you, Natwar''.

1102
02:30:33,618 --> 02:30:34,880
We won't meet anymore.

1103
02:31:13,391 --> 02:31:16,940
We're going to die.
But you won't live either.

1104
02:31:29,474 --> 02:31:30,896
He died like a man!

1105
02:31:50,729 --> 02:31:54,517
This won't stop till you are alive.

1106
02:31:56,267 --> 02:32:02,820
lf you want to stop this,
you'll have to fly. Fly, Natwar.

1107
02:37:45,249 --> 02:37:48,480
We must stop him, else he will
kill him and turn a murderer!

1108
02:39:27,919 --> 02:39:29,784
l'm a man of my word, Vikram.

1109
02:39:31,355 --> 02:39:33,255
You may even have turned
against your friends.

1110
02:39:33,624 --> 02:39:37,412
But l keep my word with my enemies too!

1111
02:39:39,564 --> 02:39:42,636
Here are the diamonds.
And out there is the border.

1112
02:39:44,202 --> 02:39:45,829
Pick it up and go through, if
you have courage enough.

1113
02:40:42,059 --> 02:40:43,128
Do you remember this medal?

1114
02:40:46,030 --> 02:40:48,180
This was awarded in recognition
of my brother's honesty.

1115
02:40:50,801 --> 02:40:54,430
You've never been able to buy him out.

1116
02:40:56,774 --> 02:40:59,481
And your torture couldn't ever
sway him away from his honesty.

1117
02:41:01,779 --> 02:41:06,773
His wife lost her child.
You've destroyed their home.

1118
02:41:09,353 --> 02:41:15,303
But you haven't been able to
destroy their honesty and integrity.

1119
02:41:18,129 --> 02:41:20,711
Natwar bore the scars through his
childhood...

1120
02:41:22,033 --> 02:41:29,189
...innocence and honesty were
burnt in the fire of crime...!

1121
02:41:29,540 --> 02:41:31,849
There was only one goal left in his life.

1122
02:41:43,854 --> 02:41:45,242
Let go! Natwar!

1123
02:41:45,690 --> 02:41:47,590
He is a criminal.
The Law will punish him.

1124
02:41:47,992 --> 02:41:52,622
No! Not the law! His crimes have
hurt us! Hurt you! Hurt Mother!

1125
02:41:53,698 --> 02:41:56,360
lf the law punishes him, how
will the fires that have...

1126
02:41:56,734 --> 02:41:58,474
...been raging in my heart ever
since childhood be quenched?

1127
02:42:00,471 --> 02:42:02,098
Watch it, everyone!
Not a single step forward!

1128
02:42:23,294 --> 02:42:27,196
With the death of Vikram,
ends the story of Natwar.

1129
02:42:28,366 --> 02:42:30,072
But what happened to the tiger, Daddy?

1130
02:42:31,902 --> 02:42:33,642
Didn't we see it in the zoo, the other day?

1131
02:42:34,105 --> 02:42:36,255
That tiger!
But it was sitting quietly.

1132
02:42:36,807 --> 02:42:38,752
You were telling me that
everyone is scared of him!

1133
02:42:39,944 --> 02:42:44,495
He is also living an honest
life like Natwarlal these days.

1134
02:42:45,483 --> 02:42:48,714
But, what happened to Shanno?

1135
02:42:49,387 --> 02:42:51,730
The one who was taking her
buffaloes in the airplane?

1136
02:42:53,157 --> 02:42:55,546
You're sitting here still!
Haven't you to get ready!

1137
02:42:56,060 --> 02:42:58,802
Daddy was telling me the story of Shanno.

1138
02:43:00,765 --> 02:43:04,713
l was just praising your good standards.

1139
02:43:05,770 --> 02:43:10,082
Don't lie! You crib behind my back!
And speak of my standard!

1140
02:43:10,508 --> 02:43:13,329
l've stopped lying. May
your face be spited if l lie!

1141
02:43:14,245 --> 02:43:18,955
Have you started quarreling again?
You're always harassing her!

1142
02:43:19,617 --> 02:43:23,280
- Mother, he's...
- What! l was only praising her.

1143
02:43:23,721 --> 02:43:26,224
l was speaking of how modern she
was, even in the good old days.

1144
02:43:26,690 --> 02:43:28,954
People can't grow crops on soil...

1145
02:43:29,326 --> 02:43:32,511
...and she was already thinking
of growing crops in airplanes.

1146
02:43:33,030 --> 02:43:34,770
Just think of it.
Rice grains would be that big!

1147
02:43:35,933 --> 02:43:37,082
Sugarcane as thick as that!

1148
02:43:37,501 --> 02:43:39,731
Shut up, Natwar!
Else l'll slap you.

1149
02:43:40,371 --> 02:43:44,159
And who are you to beat
him up, as long as l'm alive?

1150
02:43:45,476 --> 02:43:50,300
l'm very happy that you've
come away from crime.

1151
02:43:51,115 --> 02:43:54,107
You have been born again.
Now, what do you intend to do?

1152
02:43:55,019 --> 02:43:57,408
l was thinking in terms of starting a
business.

1153
02:43:58,155 --> 02:44:00,862
- Again!
- Yes. l'll earn four price.

1154
02:44:01,492 --> 02:44:04,802
l'll pay my taxes with two
and give two to my mother.

1155
02:44:05,463 --> 02:44:08,330
l'd give Shanno two...oh no!
She'll steal from me anyway.

1156
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:13,663
You'll earn four and spend six!
