00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
episode 7 will start at : 12:10

2
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,002
Kurdoglu.

3
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,133
Tell me? Whose dog are you?

4
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:11,933
Where is my brother?
Where is the Shahzade?

5
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,533
Talk!

6
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,666
It won’t be so easy this time!

7
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,290
{\an8}ALEPPO

8
00:16:45,223 --> 00:16:47,556
You have not even blinked an eye
the whole night.

9
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,623
I have caused great distress
with the news I gave you.

10
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:55,523
You are not the source of my troubles,
just the opposite...

11
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,790
...we learned who the traitor was
thanks to you.

12
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:05,623
I worked for our vizier for years,
he is a very good man, he was...

13
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,290
-...on the right path for years but...
-But the important thing is...

14
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:13,756
...not to be on the righteous path but
not to stray for even for a second.

15
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,990
Alright, Vizier Sahabettin
had served our state well for years...

16
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:23,623
...but this does not mean that we shall
turn a blind eye on the things he did.

17
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,790
Because of the things I shared, I feel
responsible for the fate of your uncle.

18
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:41,656
Sahabettin Tugrul’s fate shall be
whatever he deserves.

19
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,556
I had personally said that
whomever collaborates with the Templars...

20
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:50,256
...and becomes a traitor shall be
hanged at the city walls.

21
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:56,746
Hamza...

22
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:01,480
...are the Alps ready for
the security of the migration route?

23
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,780
They are ready, Bey.

24
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:08,946
Ilyas Fakih...

25
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,780
...did you talk with the families of
the people who have to stay behind...

26
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:15,113
...because of this plague?
-I did, Bey.

27
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:18,913
I tried to comfort them but it is hard.

28
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:23,280
May God never test anyone
with their children.

29
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,480
If He does, may He grant them
the patience to overcome the pain.

30
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,980
Amen.

31
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:32,213
Akcakoca...

32
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,246
...would this plague spread outside
the confinement?

33
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:41,313
Bey, these things cannot be known
by looking from the outside...

34
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,113
...but it seems that this plague
is not spreading outside.

35
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,146
If you see it fit as well...

36
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:56,146
...there is nothing else holding us back
from the journey.

37
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,313
I see it fit, me may go.

38
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:04,046
Then...

39
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,446
...for our loved ones in the graves
and for our babies in their cots...

40
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:12,113
...as an Oguz tribe,
we shall walk to our new homeland.

41
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:38,530
The tribe is in enough turmoil as it is,
why do you summon me here?

42
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,930
I know...

43
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,230
...Kurdoglu did not manage to kill
Suleyman Shah.

44
00:22:48,396 --> 00:22:51,563
Do not feel sorrow, Selcan. It is soon.

45
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,630
You shall revenge the death of
your father Alpsungur.

46
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,330
Suleyman Shah’s death
will be from your hands.

47
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,496
But first there is another evil
you need to solve.

48
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,996
-What evil is that?
-Plague!

49
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:16,096
The whole tribe shall be infected soon.

50
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:20,263
You have to save yourself
and your son from this evil.

51
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:24,496
The ill are isolated. The animals
are burnt! What are you saying?

52
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,930
It is not over yet.

53
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:29,963
This evil shall take many more lives.

54
00:23:31,563 --> 00:23:33,863
This evil does not have a remedy.

55
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,330
There is nothing else but confinement.

56
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,130
I do have a cure.

57
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:45,963
You should drink this every day.

58
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:52,196
It will protect you, your husband
and most importantly...

59
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,130
...your son from this evil.

60
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,230
What happened?
What were you doing here, Kurdoglu?

61
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:16,296
I rode my horse without rest
for the safety of our Bey.

62
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,796
Thank God, I made it in time.

63
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:22,196
My blood brother, my life brother.

64
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:24,663
Was it an intuition, Kurdoglu?

65
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:29,196
How did you know that something
like this might happen to our Bey?

66
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:34,763
Mother Hayme, this dog called
Bozok came to me a few days ago...

67
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:37,696
...asking me about the
death of his father.

68
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:40,763
He heard Gundogdu accusing me
in the headquarters.

69
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:44,830
He saw me as the killer of his father.

70
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:47,230
He stuck a knife at my throat.

71
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,763
I still pitied him thinking that he is in
deep sorrow, he was a boy of this tribe...

72
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:55,463
...and forgave this impudence.

73
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:04,096
But when Gundogdu mentioned that
the Bey’s tent was cut with a knife...

74
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:08,563
...God forbid,
implied that he was attacked...

75
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,663
...I thought about how some people might
have whispered something in his ear.

76
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,696
Then I could not stay back, so I got on
my horse and rode until it was exhausted.

77
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,163
What happened to my tribe in two days?

78
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:31,396
Traitors have embarked, Alps have
separated and everything has fallen apart.

79
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,333
Thank you, despite everything, Kurdoglu.

80
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,566
What if you were late?

81
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:32,633
God has spared our Bey’s life to us ,
Wild Demir. The rest is not important.

82
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,533
Well?

83
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,633
What will you do now?
Will you come with us to Aleppo?

84
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:48,433
No, I have to return. I cannot leave
the tribe alone in a migration journey.

85
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,866
You are with our Shah, Wild Demir.
I know he is in good hands.

86
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:55,800
Thank you.

87
00:21:58,133 --> 00:21:59,433
See you in Aleppo.

88
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:35,426
This is Turgut’s axe!

89
00:25:45,693 --> 00:25:47,660
And this is Shahzade’s necklace.

90
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,560
What are they doing here, Bey?

91
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,393
Sit down.

92
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,560
I will tell you everything.

93
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:16,326
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS TEMPLARS CASTLE

94
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,360
Yigit...

95
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:25,793
...do not let yourself down.

96
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:28,826
Patience is bitter but its fruit is sweet.

97
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:31,060
Alright, my lion?

98
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,926
I am fine, Turgut Aga.
I am only a bit tired.

99
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:37,960
Well done, my boy.

100
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,560
Why did you chain the Shahzade?
Untie him quick.

101
00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:07,826
My Shahzade, your cap.

102
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,493
Have some water.

103
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,893
These crass savages have been tactless.
Having a Shahzade like you...

104
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,526
...breath the same air
with a shepherd is shameful.

105
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:38,326
Would you like me to wash your face,
Shahzade?

106
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:58,026
I am Cardinal Thomas.
I come from the Papacy.

107
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:01,693
I am always ready to assist you.

108
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:07,060
I could not sleep all night because of
how these miserable people treated you.

109
00:28:07,826 --> 00:28:10,026
I have arranged a special room for you.

110
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,860
I would like to serve the best I can
to host you in a manner deserving of...

111
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,926
...the royal blood you carry.

112
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:20,360
What about Turgut Aga?

113
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,893
Do not worry about him.
They will take good care of him.

114
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,860
Shall we go, Shahzade? Please.

115
00:28:44,426 --> 00:28:45,560
But...

116
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,826
...we have another big trouble
awaiting us.

117
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,726
It is obvious that the things I told
Sahabettin has not been heard by El Aziz.

118
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,593
Today El Aziz,
tore off the agreement saying that...

119
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,993
...there is plague in our tribe.

120
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,493
This means that the caravans
don’t have a home to migrate to.

121
00:29:04,726 --> 00:29:08,626
Aleppo! Aleppo! May the ground split
and take you in, Aleppo!

122
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,893
This is not the time to cry and frown.

123
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:14,993
I understand that Sahabettin fell victim
to a plot of the Templars.

124
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,060
Otherwise he would not have left me
alone in that palace no matter what.

125
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:22,626
What do you propose, Ertugrul Bey?
What is on your mind?

126
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,626
We have to learn
what happened to Sahabettin.

127
00:29:26,293 --> 00:29:29,693
The vizier is the only person
who can help us reach Yigit and Turgut...

128
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:32,393
...as well as solve
this issue of our homeland.

129
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:35,526
We cannot leave him to the mercy of
the Crusader infidels.

130
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,560
Where are we going?

131
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:58,626
We are going to watch a ceremony where
youngsters like you turn to real heroes.

132
00:30:24,393 --> 00:30:25,493
Father...

133
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:26,960
...Son...

134
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,726
...and The Holy Ghost.

135
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,626
Father...

136
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,793
...Son...

137
00:31:06,326 --> 00:31:07,593
...and The Holy Ghost.

138
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,726
Have they become Alps now?

139
00:31:20,526 --> 00:31:25,293
They have become invincible warriors,
more powerful and braver than the Alps.

140
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:04,426
My governess...

141
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,060
...I am really worried about my uncle.

142
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:16,393
Can he be in some sort of trouble?

143
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,493
You are not hiding anything
from me, are you?

144
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,560
My beautiful girl,
when did I ever hide anything from you?

145
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:41,693
Do not worry. I sent the maids.

146
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,493
We will get good news from
our vizier soon, if God permits.

147
00:32:45,826 --> 00:32:47,593
If God permits, governess.

148
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Look, whatever the news,
you shall tell me the truth. Promise me.

149
00:32:54,393 --> 00:32:56,926
Leila, do not worry.
I told you that I would.

150
00:32:57,793 --> 00:32:59,393
Promise me, governess.

151
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,693
God give me patience. Alright. I promise.

152
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:11,893
Do not be sad, Esma.

153
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:16,026
We set out a trap but could not succeed.

154
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:23,793
I did not realize that the infidels were
within us and they held my nephew...

155
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:26,026
...in their hands.

156
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:29,960
Who do you suspect, Efendi?

157
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,793
I did not consider him at first but...

158
00:33:32,926 --> 00:33:34,293
...Nasir.

159
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:37,260
Do not be scared. Do not be afraid.

160
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:42,893
My brave Esma. There is no one
I can trust in the palace apart from you.

161
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:47,993
What can I do for you, Efendi?

162
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,526
Just order.

163
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:53,560
You need to find someone
and bring him here for me.

164
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:56,026
His name is Ertugrul.

165
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:31,526
My uncle.

166
00:34:33,326 --> 00:34:34,826
Did she bring the news?

167
00:34:40,393 --> 00:34:42,493
Calm down, Leila. You will get ill.

168
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:45,726
I am calm, governess. You promised me.

169
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,460
You shall tell me straight up.

170
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,726
Is my uncle well?

171
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:54,760
Vizier Sahabettin has been arrested.

172
00:34:57,926 --> 00:34:59,460
He is to be tried.

173
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,326
Who did this and why?

174
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:06,360
Leila, calm down.

175
00:35:09,493 --> 00:35:10,626
Your brother.

176
00:35:12,293 --> 00:35:15,993
Your uncle was arrested on
the orders of your brother Ameer El Aziz.

177
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,260
Leila, Leila.

178
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,926
You need to be calm. Come and sit here.

179
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:33,993
Come on, my girl.

180
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,560
Calm down. You need to be calm.

181
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:41,826
Brother. I have to see my brother.

182
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:44,526
Governess, I have to save my uncle.

183
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,493
Do I understand you correctly?

184
00:35:51,993 --> 00:35:54,693
This man called you smooth faced...

185
00:35:56,493 --> 00:35:57,726
...and you got angry.

186
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:01,293
Yes, your highness.

187
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,726
But you cannot grow a beard.
Why do you get angry?

188
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,326
Anyway, you tell me.

189
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:17,960
-Your highness, this smooth face came...
-That is not appropriate.

190
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,893
In my presence, in the presence of
Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz...

191
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:28,493
...you shall both watch your manners.
Now talk.

192
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,493
Efendi, this man came and...

193
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,860
...plucked my beard, Efendi.

194
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:40,426
Is that all?

195
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:54,626
-Nasir.
-Yes, your highness?

196
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:57,560
Throw both of them to the dungeon.

197
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:03,293
They shall stay in the dungeon
until the smooth face grows a beard.

198
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,060
When the smooth face grows a beard,
the man whose beard was plucked...

199
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,893
...shall pluck the beard of smooth face
to exercise the right to eye for an eye.

200
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:16,760
And this problem shall be solved.

201
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:24,660
-Let me go, your highness!
-Let me go! I beg you, let me go!

202
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:27,326
-Please spare us.
-Let me go! Let me go!

203
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,493
Nasir? Are these real?

204
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:34,960
Or did you arrange
this visit day to entertain me?

205
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,360
Please know that I have no contribution
at all, your highness.

206
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,460
Your subjects came to take refuge
in your justice.

207
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:44,726
My dear Nasir...

208
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:48,060
...why didn’t you tell me that
these state issues are so boring.

209
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:58,393
Your highness.

210
00:38:03,393 --> 00:38:04,726
Leila Sultan.

211
00:38:05,726 --> 00:38:09,660
I do not understand.
What happened to Leila Sultan?

212
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:12,660
She is not well. They wait for you.

213
00:38:42,393 --> 00:38:44,393
I have just seen Sahabettin.

214
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,593
He suspects you.

215
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,793
Peace be upon you.

216
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:08,760
My dear Afsin Bey.

217
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:16,260
When they said that they saw you in the
streets of Aleppo, I did not believe them.

218
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:19,026
So the youngsters realized that
I was following them.

219
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:20,993
You raised them well.

220
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,026
But I am surprised. Is there anyone
left in the youngsters who know me?

221
00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:26,526
Please.

222
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:31,326
Your fame precedes you, Afsin Bey.

223
00:39:32,026 --> 00:39:34,960
And the ones who don’t know,
we tell what a valiant man you are.

224
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,260
Do not say that.

225
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,926
But we talked about you, we tell
the youngsters that you are a martyr.

226
00:39:41,326 --> 00:39:44,826
But you are as alive as us.
We were just creating a myth.

227
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:49,593
Is there any news about
the wise man in Ahlat, Aykutluk.

228
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:54,493
It has been a while since
I have to Ahlat and talk with them.

229
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,260
But the news we received is not nice.

230
00:39:58,726 --> 00:40:01,760
They say that the path taken
by the Seljuk dynasty is not right.

231
00:40:01,893 --> 00:40:05,293
Taking Sultan Aladdin from the Konya
palace and burning down the rest...

232
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:08,593
...would not be a sin, they say.
I do not know what will happen.

233
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,760
When a cloud covers the crescent,
they say the night is dark, Aykutluk.

234
00:40:15,626 --> 00:40:17,660
But everything depends on a wind.

235
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:21,860
The crescent shall shine again,
you can be rest assured about that.

236
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:24,426
Anyway, I want something else from you.

237
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:25,893
Listen closely.

238
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:30,393
Inform all your ears and eyes
in the streets of Aleppo.

239
00:40:31,026 --> 00:40:34,293
We need to learn
the fate of Vizier Sahabettin.

240
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,626
Thank you.

241
00:40:43,993 --> 00:40:45,926
Leila? My sister?

242
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,360
Brother, where is our uncle?

243
00:40:57,493 --> 00:41:01,993
The starry night of Aleppo, Leila.

244
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,593
Why do you worry, my dear sister?

245
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:08,060
He did not visit me for days.

246
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,826
He never neglected me before.

247
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,460
Are the things I heard true?

248
00:41:17,326 --> 00:41:18,460
My Leila.

249
00:41:20,526 --> 00:41:22,026
The ache of my heart.

250
00:41:22,593 --> 00:41:24,660
Why do you make a fuss over my uncle?

251
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,393
He must be drowned in state work.
He would visit you in a few days.

252
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,560
Tell me the truth, brother!
Are the things I heard true?

253
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,560
Is my uncle in prison?

254
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:37,893
When a slight breeze passes,
you tremble like a dry leaf.

255
00:41:38,726 --> 00:41:43,493
Your innocent heart cannot bear
the ugliness of the world.

256
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,526
You would be bedridden
like a wilting rose.

257
00:41:47,526 --> 00:41:49,760
My precious sister...

258
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,826
...do not think about our uncle.
-Brother. Is it true?

259
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,060
Our uncle Sahabettin...

260
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,693
...engaged in things not befitting to him.

261
00:42:03,593 --> 00:42:06,560
Unfortunately,
what you heard is true, my sister.

262
00:42:07,393 --> 00:42:08,793
I do not believe that.

263
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,426
How can you believe such a thing?

264
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,426
Our uncle would never attempt a bad thing.

265
00:42:25,326 --> 00:42:27,460
You are mistaken, my innocent sister.

266
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:30,293
Our precious uncle...

267
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,426
...our wise vizier...

268
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,393
...collaborated with the killers
of our father, the Templar Knights.

269
00:42:49,826 --> 00:42:51,393
Leila, Leila.

270
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:54,060
Leila.

271
00:42:55,326 --> 00:42:56,793
Leila! Leila!

272
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:11,360
I told your request to our people,
Afsin Bey. We will hear something soon.

273
00:45:11,493 --> 00:45:13,926
Shall we drink some sherbet
and rest until then?

274
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,526
Ertugrul?

275
00:45:55,593 --> 00:45:56,960
Tell me, my Sultan.

276
00:45:58,393 --> 00:45:59,926
Do not worry about me.

277
00:46:00,993 --> 00:46:02,493
I shall be fine.

278
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:05,426
I know.

279
00:46:07,526 --> 00:46:09,926
But I burn inside as I see you in pain.

280
00:46:12,293 --> 00:46:14,493
You risked your own life to save me.

281
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
What if something happened to you?

282
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,626
But it did not. I am fine.

283
00:46:30,693 --> 00:46:32,926
When I opened my heart to you that day...

284
00:46:34,426 --> 00:46:37,926
...you denied it. You are ready to
sacrifice yourself but...

285
00:46:38,726 --> 00:46:41,560
...you refrain from
telling me what is in your heart.

286
00:46:43,993 --> 00:46:47,626
When a girl knows that
she cannot attain her worldly love...

287
00:46:47,893 --> 00:46:50,560
...she yearns to reach the Godly love.

288
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,560
Ertugrul you always told me the truth.

289
00:46:58,793 --> 00:47:01,493
I beg you not to hide
the truth from me now.

290
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,593
I know it is not a good sign
that they are so delayed.

291
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,760
Is there any news about Yigit and Turgut,
Ertugrul?

292
00:47:14,393 --> 00:47:17,026
-Yes.
-Tell me the truth, Ertugrul.

293
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,760
Did something happen to my brother?

294
00:47:23,526 --> 00:47:24,926
The Templars...

295
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,960
...took them as prisoners.

296
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,260
Don’t.

297
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,760
Yigit must be devastated. Ertugrul...

298
00:47:40,426 --> 00:47:42,626
Ertugrul, I beg you, save Yigit.

299
00:47:43,426 --> 00:47:46,926
I promise you, Halime.
I will bring your brother back to you.

300
00:47:55,993 --> 00:47:57,360
Hatun.

301
00:48:29,426 --> 00:48:31,793
You shall be a bit uncomfortable but...

302
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:35,660
...when we think about the long time
you shall be spending with us...

303
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:39,660
...it is best for everyone
that your paws are under control.

304
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:43,760
-Where did you take the boy?
-Don’t you worry about him.

305
00:48:44,326 --> 00:48:47,660
You can be rest assured that
we will look after him very well.

306
00:48:47,793 --> 00:48:50,960
He is an innocent boy.
What do you want from him?

307
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,293
Do whatever you want to do to me!

308
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,493
Why do you think that we treat him badly?

309
00:48:57,293 --> 00:49:01,860
Cardinal Thomas who came here
is looking after him personally.

310
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,626
You should have seen them while
they were watching the knights.

311
00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:12,926
In the eyes of the small Shahzade,
there was a sparkle that is befitting...

312
00:49:13,293 --> 00:49:15,693
...of the poor warriors of Jesus.

313
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,793
Welcome, my princess.

314
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:07,360
Where is Elanora?

315
00:50:07,726 --> 00:50:10,060
Why didn’t my sister come out to greet me?

316
00:50:10,393 --> 00:50:12,560
Ma’am, Ustad is waiting for you.

317
00:50:12,826 --> 00:50:15,460
He shall inform you about
this matter as well.

318
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:34,793
Isadora!

319
00:50:38,793 --> 00:50:40,393
My dear niece.

320
00:50:40,793 --> 00:50:42,360
You are here at last.

321
00:50:44,893 --> 00:50:46,860
I missed you very much, dear uncle.

322
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,260
But my sweet sister is still
nowhere to be seen.

323
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,460
Didn’t she miss me?

324
00:50:53,993 --> 00:50:57,860
But she was urging me to come as soon as
possible in the letter she wrote to me.

325
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,293
Where is Elanora, uncle?

326
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,826
-Governess?
-I am here, Leila.

327
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,893
Close the curtains, governess.
There is too much light inside.

328
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:39,026
My dear girl...

329
00:51:39,593 --> 00:51:42,726
...if you could get up and walk a bit,
if you could eat something...

330
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,826
...you would regain your strength.

331
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,993
You did not eat anything the whole day.
I am really worried about you, Leila.

332
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,060
Close the curtains, governess.

333
00:52:18,693 --> 00:52:20,426
Is there any news, Afsin Bey?

334
00:52:20,893 --> 00:52:22,360
What is his situation?

335
00:52:23,493 --> 00:52:25,626
The news is not very good, Ertugrul Bey.

336
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,560
Sahabettin Tugrul is arrested.
He is in Aleppo dungeons.

337
00:52:36,726 --> 00:52:37,993
What is the reason?

338
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:45,726
What is he accused with?

339
00:52:45,926 --> 00:52:48,593
The accusation is not known, Ertugrul Bey.

340
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,293
But yesterday Chief of Guard Nasir
and Melik El Aziz were seen...

341
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:55,260
...taking something out.

342
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,993
There was a maid from
the palace with them as well.

343
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,026
It might be something to do
with the vizier.

344
00:53:30,426 --> 00:53:32,326
Are you better now, Isadora?

345
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:34,993
How did it happen, uncle?

346
00:53:35,493 --> 00:53:37,693
How did my beautiful sister die?

347
00:53:38,693 --> 00:53:40,460
You know that...

348
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:44,560
...Elanora never accepted
his father’s death.

349
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:51,026
And this thought had started
to affect her health.

350
00:53:52,793 --> 00:53:55,693
Maybe she mentioned this to you
in her letters.

351
00:53:58,693 --> 00:53:59,826
Mad girl.

352
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:04,893
She had a wild idea that
your father was in the dungeon.

353
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,760
She insisted to go there and started
to create ridiculous excuses to go there.

354
00:54:12,593 --> 00:54:17,760
And she did not want understand
how dangerous the dungeon was for her.

355
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,460
I forbade her to go there.

356
00:54:24,626 --> 00:54:25,726
But...

357
00:54:26,993 --> 00:54:29,460
...a day when I was not in the castle...

358
00:54:31,426 --> 00:54:32,993
Did she go down the dungeon?

359
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,493
One of the ferocious convicts...

360
00:54:36,793 --> 00:54:39,360
...in the hope of that he might escape...

361
00:54:40,926 --> 00:54:44,393
...killed our innocent Elanora.

362
00:54:46,693 --> 00:54:48,893
-Is that convict still alive?
-No.

363
00:54:50,493 --> 00:54:56,760
He was executed,
just like the guards who let her go in.

364
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,426
Elanora’s death was avenged
in a suitable manner.

365
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:46,626
She is very tame, Efendi.

366
00:55:46,893 --> 00:55:48,860
But she knows her job well.

367
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,760
One of the most beautiful girls
we have, Efendi.

368
00:56:25,626 --> 00:56:28,326
-How is this one?
-She can stay.

369
00:57:01,893 --> 00:57:04,560
This one is a genuine pearl.

370
00:57:05,493 --> 00:57:07,893
Words are not enough
to describe her beauty.

371
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:12,026
She is intelligent, skillful, educated.

372
00:57:12,826 --> 00:57:14,860
She has a beautiful voice as well.

373
00:57:15,026 --> 00:57:19,360
She can sing, recite poems
and dances beautifully.

374
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,893
Those who watch her dance are enchanted.

375
00:57:38,593 --> 00:57:40,026
You can arrange the rest.

376
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,493
You know how this axe is made, right?

377
00:58:39,426 --> 00:58:40,560
Yes.

378
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,760
I know well.

379
00:58:42,993 --> 00:58:48,993
A heap of steel becomes an axe
blow by blow, beaten up endlessly.

380
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:52,326
Well...

381
00:58:52,526 --> 00:58:56,960
...do you know how miners makes the metal
and how leather man makes leather?

382
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,493
If this piece of leather on you
didn’t get beaten blow by blow...

383
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,326
...it would have become
a piece of garbage.

384
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:16,760
If it wasn’t fired, the metal in your
sword would still be a rock somewhere.

385
00:59:18,593 --> 00:59:20,360
What about you, Ertugrul?

386
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:25,026
What would happen if you were not tested?
Do you know that?

387
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,893
The problem is not only me being tested.

388
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:37,460
My friends,
my battle comrades, my family...

389
00:59:38,026 --> 00:59:41,560
...my tribe who trusted me.
The vizier who wanted to help me.

390
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,293
They are all in great difficulties
because of me.

391
00:59:46,826 --> 00:59:49,460
The pain caused by this
is burning my soul.

392
00:59:51,426 --> 00:59:53,526
Existence is a school, son.

393
00:59:54,293 --> 00:59:55,926
Everyone is a student.

394
00:59:57,326 --> 00:59:59,993
And God is the only Teacher.

395
01:00:02,793 --> 01:00:06,893
He manifests His Titles and test us.

396
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:12,826
But distress or blessing,
mercy or trouble is always from Him.

397
01:00:13,793 --> 01:00:16,026
Everyone lives their own exam.

398
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:21,760
You need to be one of the people who pass
the exam and submit yourself to Him.

399
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:28,493
Then you would be the greatest warrior
and the greatest hero.

400
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:32,326
Is sitting around like this
a test as well?

401
01:00:32,493 --> 01:00:35,826
God likes submission, son, not imprudence.

402
01:00:39,726 --> 01:00:42,360
If a brother is in a bad situation...

403
01:00:43,626 --> 01:00:50,026
...submission is to look for a way
to get him out, without forgetting God.

404
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:57,960
Come on, get up.
Test of a valiant is not easy.

405
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,693
And a valiant should not stop.

406
01:01:14,826 --> 01:01:16,026
Her room.

407
01:01:17,393 --> 01:01:21,260
-If you don’t want to stay here...
-On the contrary, I want to stay here.

408
01:01:21,626 --> 01:01:26,293
You are very tired.
Rest well tonight, Isadora.

409
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,793
Good night, my girl.

410
01:01:30,826 --> 01:01:32,293
Good night.

411
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:11,860
Bey...

412
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:15,026
...I am the private maid of
Vizier Sahabettin Tugrul.

413
01:02:15,393 --> 01:02:17,493
My name is Esma, he sent me here.

414
01:02:17,626 --> 01:02:19,693
How do I know that Sahabettin sent you?

415
01:02:20,926 --> 01:02:24,826
He told me to say “a man’s word is said
directly to a man’s face” and that...

416
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,660
...you would know, Bey.
He wants to talk face to face with you.

417
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,993
All state matters are left to you,
your highness.

418
01:03:05,326 --> 01:03:08,426
And I thought that you have
a right to enjoy life a bit.

419
01:03:08,693 --> 01:03:11,426
I hope that I was not tactless.

420
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,426
How will you take me in?

421
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:59,460
There is a secret passage that goes
to the dungeons. My vizier told me.

422
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:02,393
We will slip through there
without anyone realizing.

423
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:02,260
We will slip through there
without anyone realizing.

424
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,093
Do not let yourself go, son.
Be strong.

425
01:10:01,393 --> 01:10:04,460
They will test your will to the limits.

426
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,926
What more can they do to me?

427
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,493
I do not care about myself...

428
01:10:16,893 --> 01:10:19,626
...I wonder what they are doing
to that innocent boy.

429
01:10:20,526 --> 01:10:22,660
They might have even killed him.

430
01:10:25,226 --> 01:10:26,560
Look, young man...

431
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,860
...if your body is in this dungeon...

432
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:35,993
...the thing that awaits you
is much more than death itself.

433
01:10:38,226 --> 01:10:41,026
If you know what will happen
to us so well...

434
01:10:42,193 --> 01:10:44,460
...you must know those infidels well.

435
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:51,960
Because I know them so well,
I am in this dungeon for 17 years.

436
01:10:54,393 --> 01:10:57,860
How did you bear this for so long?

437
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,260
With love.

438
01:11:02,226 --> 01:11:08,160
The one who lights up the darkness
inside you even if your eyes are closed.

439
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:14,426
Do not stop thinking for even one second.

440
01:11:17,393 --> 01:11:20,960
-Are you a hunter.
-I am the hunted this time.

441
01:11:23,026 --> 01:11:28,526
The new home will be a new and joyous life
for all of us. Especially for us.

442
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:32,360
-Does Aleppo have everything?
-It has everything.

443
01:11:32,926 --> 01:11:35,226
When we reach there, it will be complete.

444
01:11:35,626 --> 01:11:39,126
We will go and we will wed.

445
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,660
This is my promise to you.

446
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,060
Aykiz?

447
01:12:40,326 --> 01:12:41,493
Let me see?

448
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,260
It is a deep wound.

449
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,360
Thank you.

450
01:13:02,626 --> 01:13:04,026
Aykiz...

451
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,926
...I was presumptuous.

452
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:11,093
I broke your heart.
But believe me, it was not my intention.

453
01:13:13,593 --> 01:13:16,093
When you talked like that
about Ertugrul...

454
01:13:19,926 --> 01:13:23,860
Aykiz, there is nothing
in my hand except my dreams and hopes.

455
01:13:25,426 --> 01:13:28,193
The only thing that
make me go forward is hope.

456
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:33,360
If I did not have that, I would die right
here, right now from disappointment.

457
01:13:33,626 --> 01:13:36,960
You cannot sooth your pain
by hurting others, Gokce.

458
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,426
But do not despair so much.
My problem is not you.

459
01:13:43,426 --> 01:13:46,326
I thought that as we near Aleppo
I would be relieved...

460
01:13:46,493 --> 01:13:49,960
...I would be joyous with
seeing Turgut again.

461
01:13:52,593 --> 01:13:55,093
But a shadow is cast over my heart.

462
01:13:56,593 --> 01:14:01,293
It is as if I am getting further away from
my sweetheart, instead of nearing him.

463
01:14:03,626 --> 01:14:06,093
Memories pass in front my eyes.

464
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:12,226
Don’t tire yourself out
over nothing, Aykiz.

465
01:14:12,426 --> 01:14:15,493
Over all the hardships and
sorrows we go through...

466
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:18,960
...your love is like a flower
that heralds the spring.

467
01:14:19,593 --> 01:14:22,126
Ertugrul’s love made you a poet.

468
01:14:27,193 --> 01:14:29,060
May God bless us all.

469
01:14:31,226 --> 01:14:34,626
I only want to meet Turgut safe and sound,
that is enough for me.

470
01:14:38,026 --> 01:14:39,060
Come on.

471
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:54,960
I am hungry like the wolf, Hatun.

472
01:14:55,093 --> 01:14:56,860
Can’t you hurry up a bit?

473
01:14:57,626 --> 01:14:59,026
I am coming, Bey.

474
01:15:29,026 --> 01:15:34,160
I made the food you like.
It has been a while since we ate alone.

475
01:15:35,326 --> 01:15:38,293
-May it be healthy, Gundogdu.
-Thank you, Hatun.

476
01:15:40,126 --> 01:15:41,493
May it be healthy.

477
01:15:42,526 --> 01:15:46,426
Hatun, I don’t have time for anything
because of the tribe’s issues.

478
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:49,993
You are right, Gundogdu.
You are like Bey of the tribe right now.

479
01:15:50,126 --> 01:15:52,393
It is not easy to carry this load.

480
01:15:53,493 --> 01:15:55,426
May God give you strength.

481
01:15:58,326 --> 01:16:00,860
-Come on, Bismillah. Eat up.
-Bismillah.

482
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:03,626
Do we have permission, Gundogdu?

483
01:16:06,193 --> 01:16:07,393
Gundogdu.

484
01:16:11,593 --> 01:16:12,960
What do you want?

485
01:16:13,426 --> 01:16:17,060
Control yourself, Gundogdu.
Don’t do anything you might regret.

486
01:16:17,226 --> 01:16:20,926
You stay away from this, Selcan Hatun.
There are things you don’t know.

487
01:16:24,326 --> 01:16:25,526
Yes...

488
01:16:26,326 --> 01:16:28,926
...these are the things
that happened, Bey.

489
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:33,493
But as you have opened your eyes,
nothing is important anymore...

490
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:36,160
...they will all pass away,
if God permits.

491
01:16:36,493 --> 01:16:40,960
Now, even if all hell breaks loose,
we can put it out with our hearts, Bey.

492
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:45,893
When we stand together in prayer line,
what trouble can hurt us?

493
01:16:46,526 --> 01:16:49,126
You have always been with me, Wild Demir.

494
01:16:50,026 --> 01:16:53,326
Anytime I had a problem,
you were on my side.

495
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,860
You are closer than a brother for me.

496
01:16:57,593 --> 01:17:00,160
When you talk about brotherhood, Bey...

497
01:17:00,393 --> 01:17:03,360
...you, I, Kurdoglu...

498
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,893
...Alpsungur.

499
01:17:14,093 --> 01:17:17,260
We were brothers. Yes, we were.

500
01:17:20,293 --> 01:17:22,593
Look, we are still like that. But...

501
01:17:24,193 --> 01:17:28,960
Friendship get valuable with age, Bey.
Old friends like you and I.

502
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:34,426
Did you see Kurdoglu? He could not hit
a bear in front of him in the old times.

503
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:39,993
As he gets older, his eyes started
seeing better than a hawk, God bless.

504
01:17:58,493 --> 01:18:02,960
This man is someone who I call Emmi
and our Shah calls blood brother.

505
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:07,426
But what did he do?
He tried to kill our Shah.

506
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:13,293
The matter is not like you think,
Gundogdu.

507
01:18:13,526 --> 01:18:17,193
-First you have to listen to me.
-What will you tell me? What?

508
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:22,060
How you panicked when I told you
that you secretly went into the tent?

509
01:18:22,526 --> 01:18:26,360
Or how you went to finish off the job
in the middle of the night? Which one?

510
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:29,660
What are you saying, Gundogdu?

511
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:34,860
I went to save Suleyman Shah from
the fury of the rabid son of Baybora.

512
01:18:36,293 --> 01:18:38,493
I saved our Bey at the last second.

513
01:18:39,093 --> 01:18:43,093
Moreover it was you who warned me
by telling me the tear in the tent.

514
01:18:44,526 --> 01:18:47,260
It was Bozok who went
into the Marquee that night.

515
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:51,193
I went after him so that he cannot
complete the job he left unfinished.

516
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,493
And...

517
01:19:05,026 --> 01:19:07,226
...I just came to congratulate you.

518
01:19:07,926 --> 01:19:12,093
Mother Hayme told me.
I wanted to congratulate our new nephew.

519
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:16,026
The group talked nothing else but this.

520
01:19:16,993 --> 01:19:19,660
Did Suleyman Shah,
our father heard it as well?

521
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:21,560
What did he say?

522
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:25,360
He was the most happy one.
Suleyman Shah was overjoyed with...

523
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:27,660
...the news of a grandson.

524
01:19:34,326 --> 01:19:35,526
Anyway...

525
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:39,360
...I said what I came to say.
I should not bother you anymore.

526
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,593
Everything happened as you expected,
Ertugrul Bey.

527
01:20:28,393 --> 01:20:29,626
Yes, it did.

528
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:33,960
They become a hunt while being a hunter,
with God’s permission.

529
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,993
But the situation is more complex
than we thought.

530
01:20:38,126 --> 01:20:41,893
If Sahabettin’s most trusted maid
whom he sent for me is a traitor...

531
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:45,126
...the vizier is stuck in the trap.

532
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:51,660
If a lion is trapped,
even the jackals start to growl.

533
01:20:54,593 --> 01:20:56,893
We have to save him whatever the cost.

534
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,426
I will be gone for a while, Ertugrul Bey.

535
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:29,893
Is this the right time, Afsin Bey.

536
01:21:30,593 --> 01:21:32,960
Will you be leaving us alone
in this fight?

537
01:21:34,293 --> 01:21:38,960
Ertugrul Bey, I know that you wonder
who I am, how far I can reach and...

538
01:21:39,093 --> 01:21:44,993
...where my roots are. I will answer
all your questions and more in time.

539
01:21:45,893 --> 01:21:49,426
But now, we have to pass through a bridge
that is thinner than a hair and...

540
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:53,960
...sharper than a sword. I ask for
one thing and that is for you to trust me.

541
01:22:03,593 --> 01:22:08,326
We fought side by side, Afsin Bey. We have
a code of battle friendship between us.

542
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:11,426
I believe in you.

543
01:22:12,993 --> 01:22:17,260
Tomorrow you should go to the Turkmen
carpet man in the market, Ertugrul Bey.

544
01:22:18,226 --> 01:22:21,626
His name is Aykutluk.
He will help you in every way he can.

545
01:22:22,893 --> 01:22:27,893
And I will enter through
the gates of hell for Turgut and Yigit.

546
01:22:28,993 --> 01:22:30,193
Thank you.

547
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:43,460
Where did those men come from?
How could you not see them, Eftelya?

548
01:22:45,326 --> 01:22:47,326
He didn’t have time to inform anyone.

549
01:22:48,393 --> 01:22:51,193
He must have suspected
beforehand and came prepared.

550
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:55,393
But how could you not notice
those two goat herders while walking?

551
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,926
Do you have an explanation for this?

552
01:22:58,226 --> 01:23:02,293
I could not see, Commander Titus,
that is why I escaped in the last minute.

553
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:06,593
Just like you failing against
Ertugrul every single time...

554
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:08,560
...I failed to notice his warriors.

555
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:13,026
You should understand me very well in this
manner as you are much more experienced.

556
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,960
Stop! What are you doing?

557
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:21,093
We are all like apostles
fighting for God’s lamb.

558
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:25,526
If we don’t trust each other, Jerusalem
can only be a distant dream for us!

559
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,960
Moreover, when Sahabettin
is killed tomorrow...

560
01:23:30,526 --> 01:23:35,460
...Ertugrul will only be like a sewer rat
walking around the streets of Aleppo.

561
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:43,260
Then, how you take revenge shall be
up to your personal taste.

562
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,193
You caused all this!

563
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:19,026
When will you stop being a stubborn brat?
You don’t care for anyone.

564
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:20,926
Not your father, nor your tribe!

565
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:23,926
Look at the state of this tribe!
It is cracking up!

566
01:24:24,126 --> 01:24:27,526
Winter is coming and we don’t even
know where to go! Open your eyes!

567
01:24:28,126 --> 01:24:29,393
Open your eyes!

568
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:33,393
How will this tribe stand strong,
Ertugrul? How?

569
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,560
You are lying, Ertugrul.

570
01:24:50,893 --> 01:24:53,660
The eagle is in the cage.
Now it is the wolf’s turn.

571
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:01,193
Be the sultan of my heart,
the mother of my children...

572
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,360
...and my companion till the end.

573
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:06,660
When I could not even become
the sultan of the palace I was born in...

574
01:25:06,926 --> 01:25:08,560
...I cannot be the sultan of your heart.

575
01:25:18,193 --> 01:25:22,060
<i>Great God, Who has created</i>
<i>the world and the skies, I turn to you.</i>

576
01:25:23,026 --> 01:25:25,393
<i>My aim is to set on a new road.</i>

577
01:25:25,993 --> 01:25:28,893
<i>You are the Owner of</i>
<i>the road and destination.</i>

578
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,526
<i>May You bless us at the end of this road.</i>

579
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:36,160
<i>My wish is not to be the owner of</i>
<i>a throne, a crown or property.</i>

580
01:25:37,226 --> 01:25:40,593
<i>The thing in my heart,</i>
<i>on this road I set off with Your name...</i>

581
01:25:40,926 --> 01:25:44,993
<i>...is to glorify Your name.</i>
<i>My only aim in swinging my sword is to...</i>

582
01:25:45,193 --> 01:25:50,460
<i>...make my weapon a tool of Your justice.</i>
<i>If my heart or mind strays from this...</i>

583
01:25:50,893 --> 01:25:54,493
<i>...lead me to the right path with</i>
<i>crooked swords, Dear God.</i>

584
01:25:55,293 --> 01:25:58,426
<i>On this road I set off to glorify</i>
<i>Your name don’t let my heart...</i>

585
01:25:58,593 --> 01:26:02,193
<i>...stray to worldly desires. Don’t let</i>
<i>my mind be deceived by the devil.</i>

586
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:06,326
<i>Don’t let me bow down, Dear God. Let me</i>
<i>and my progeny serve you in Your cause...</i>

587
01:26:06,426 --> 01:26:08,626
<i>...and be martyrs on this road, Great God.</i>

588
01:26:24,426 --> 01:26:25,526
Hamza.

589
01:26:27,226 --> 01:26:28,326
Yes, Bey?

590
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,460
Take this and load it to the camel.

591
01:26:36,593 --> 01:26:40,293
Look, Gundogdu.
Little feet will be wearing these.

592
01:26:40,526 --> 01:26:46,193
With time our son will grow and
be a valiant man, just like his father.

593
01:26:51,026 --> 01:26:53,993
Your heart and mine is beating
right here now.

594
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:57,660
Everything we have, all our hopes,
our happiness is here now.

595
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:04,126
He will be our life, our blood,
continuity of our progeny.

596
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:09,493
You will see that
all troubles will be left behind.

597
01:27:10,593 --> 01:27:13,326
The new homeland will be
a new world for us.

598
01:27:14,226 --> 01:27:16,426
If God permits, Hatun, if God permits.

599
01:27:16,626 --> 01:27:19,293
Let us complete
this migration journey first.

600
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,893
Come on, I have some business to
attend to, you should get ready as well.

601
01:27:58,593 --> 01:27:59,926
Father?

602
01:28:05,293 --> 01:28:07,026
We ran away for so long...

603
01:28:08,993 --> 01:28:10,660
...we faced so many troubles...

604
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:13,526
...we went through so much...

605
01:28:13,926 --> 01:28:17,160
But at the end,
we could not protect Yigit.

606
01:28:19,026 --> 01:28:21,926
There is nothing we can do
except pray, father.

607
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,560
Look at the state I am in.

608
01:28:26,226 --> 01:28:27,960
I cannot even get up.

609
01:28:32,126 --> 01:28:34,960
We will find a way in the end, Halime.

610
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:40,360
God will surely open up a blessed path
in front of us in time.

611
01:28:41,926 --> 01:28:43,560
Ertugrul Bey promised me.

612
01:28:45,326 --> 01:28:49,560
He will not let Yigit and Turgut Alp
be captive in enemy hands.

613
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,360
He will not, right, father?

614
01:28:59,993 --> 01:29:05,660
Your wound is very serious. I beg you,
don’t distress yourself so much.

615
01:29:28,093 --> 01:29:31,326
There is a Turkmen carpet man
around here with the name of Aykutluk.

616
01:29:31,426 --> 01:29:32,893
Do you know his place?

617
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:37,893
Wake up! Wake up!

618
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:41,393
Wake up!

619
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,493
Be patient, my girl, Leila, be patient.

620
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:56,893
Do not throw yourself
into those dark wells once again.

621
01:29:57,093 --> 01:29:58,560
May God help you.

622
01:30:15,126 --> 01:30:16,893
-Didn’t she eat?
-No.

623
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,493
Today will be a difficult day
for all of us.

624
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:43,926
We do not know how it will end.

625
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:51,993
No news about our vizier
shall reach Leila, do you understand me?

626
01:30:52,293 --> 01:30:58,526
As you wish. We will of course be careful.
But, how can something like this be?

627
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:02,126
How can our great vizier,
Sahabettin Tugrul...

628
01:31:02,326 --> 01:31:07,393
...whom no one can suspect his honesty
and righteousness be tried?

629
01:31:08,193 --> 01:31:13,026
You are right. We don’t know with
what kind of a slander he was imprisoned.

630
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:19,326
The only thing we can do for him
is to pray God. You may leave.

631
01:31:41,926 --> 01:31:46,926
God! God! God!

632
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,626
God! God! God!

633
01:31:52,126 --> 01:31:56,460
God! God! God!

634
01:32:20,593 --> 01:32:22,126
Welcome, Ertugrul.

635
01:32:22,526 --> 01:32:26,393
Our mad ones have been heralding that
you were coming from many streets away.

636
01:32:28,326 --> 01:32:32,226
Are all those madmen, beggars and
drunkards your comrades?

637
01:32:33,626 --> 01:32:36,660
When mayors are being bought
and sold in the market...

638
01:32:36,993 --> 01:32:40,060
...we work with madmen
in this life or death market.

639
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:46,860
We need to rescue
the vizier from the dungeon.

640
01:32:51,193 --> 01:32:54,060
It is very difficult to organize it
before a week, my brave.

641
01:32:54,226 --> 01:32:58,193
We need to contact the guards in
the dungeon, arrange their schedule.

642
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,926
Moreover he will be tried today.

643
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:03,860
In the Muslim world the balance of justice
is not that crooked yet.

644
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,026
We should not lose hope from God.
We should wait for the outcome.

645
01:34:08,193 --> 01:34:09,860
What if it is crooked?

646
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:11,893
What will we do then?

647
01:34:12,126 --> 01:34:15,326
If betrayal damages the justice,
our crooked swords shall put...

648
01:34:15,493 --> 01:34:17,993
...the strayed ones
on the right path again.

649
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,660
But, Nasir...

650
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,260
...this is dangerous.

651
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:27,560
Judge Efendi, you were not thinking
of the danger...

652
01:34:27,893 --> 01:34:30,460
...while you were putting
pouches of gold under your belt.

653
01:34:30,626 --> 01:34:34,960
You were saying the vizier is as good as
dead. Why do you tremble like a leaf now?

654
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:36,993
And...

655
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,526
...think well, Judge Efendi...

656
01:34:40,293 --> 01:34:42,993
...after the issue of the
vizier is handled...

657
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:46,526
...his highness Melik will need
consultants like you beside him.

658
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,460
Can you really do this, Nasir?

659
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:53,093
Of course.

660
01:34:53,293 --> 01:34:56,060
You are very important for me,
your judgeship.

661
01:34:56,226 --> 01:35:00,626
It is not easy to find a man
that can be bought so easily in Aleppo.

662
01:35:40,993 --> 01:35:43,860
On behalf of Emirate  of Aleppo,
Melik El Aziz.

663
01:36:16,226 --> 01:36:20,293
In the name of God Who is
The Just, The Avenger...

664
01:36:20,593 --> 01:36:24,660
...The Prevailer and The Most Gracious...

665
01:36:25,426 --> 01:36:30,860
...we shall commence the trial of  Emirate
of Aleppo Vizier, Sahabettin Tugrul.

666
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:37,493
The accusations are murder,
disobedience of an order...

667
01:36:38,593 --> 01:36:43,893
...abusing the trust given to him
and betrayal to the City of Aleppo...

668
01:36:44,093 --> 01:36:46,560
...as well as to the Muslim world.

669
01:36:56,493 --> 01:36:59,593
I am one of the private guards of
Sahabettin Tugrul...

670
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:04,660
...he ordered me to obtain
a fast acting lethal poison.

671
01:37:06,893 --> 01:37:08,460
I did as I was ordered.

672
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:19,526
I saw the people who tried to kill the
Kayi envoy with the vizier in the market.

673
01:37:20,226 --> 01:37:24,926
The vizier was giving something to them
in a pouch. I am sure that it was gold.

674
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:30,926
I am a trader, the vizier forced me...

675
01:37:31,193 --> 01:37:35,260
...he used me as a decoy in his business
dealings with the Antioch Countship.

676
01:37:38,393 --> 01:37:42,860
Sahabettin Tugrul, you have heard
the accusations, what do you say?

677
01:37:47,193 --> 01:37:49,193
I reject all the accusations.

678
01:37:51,326 --> 01:37:54,559
The accusers
are false witnesses who are bought.

679
01:38:01,893 --> 01:38:04,393
This is a platform of justice and reality.

680
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:09,026
With permission from God, these eyes
can tell between the truth and lies...

681
01:38:09,226 --> 01:38:12,260
...just like they are black or white.
You do not need to worry.

682
01:38:12,493 --> 01:38:14,326
Call in the last witness.

683
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:29,360
God send you to us, Ummulhayr Abla.
We were going to send a message to you.

684
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:32,893
-We have a problem.
-Peace be upon you.

685
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,526
-And peace be upon you.
-Welcome, Abla. What happened?

686
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:41,326
You talked about an important matter.

687
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:47,093
I do not know whether you heard about
what happened to our vizier.

688
01:38:47,293 --> 01:38:50,393
Sahabettin Tugrul is
an honest person inside and outside.

689
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,626
He is a valuable statesman
Great God has bestowed upon us.

690
01:38:54,026 --> 01:38:57,526
Everyone knows that he had been doing
his duties in a competent manner.

691
01:38:58,226 --> 01:39:00,426
He is going through a difficult test...

692
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:03,393
...may Great God be on his side.
-Amen.

693
01:39:04,226 --> 01:39:06,893
Leila has learned about her uncle.

694
01:39:08,226 --> 01:39:13,493
She is devastated since she learned that
it was her brother who arrested him.

695
01:39:14,326 --> 01:39:17,960
I worry that she may fall ill once again
and turn her back on life.

696
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:22,260
Poor girl, she was recovering
quite well recently, wasn’t she?

697
01:39:22,526 --> 01:39:26,593
Yes. She had recovered with
the support of our vizier but...

698
01:39:27,226 --> 01:39:29,026
How can we of help, Abla?

699
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,260
I...

700
01:39:31,993 --> 01:39:33,426
...if it is possible...

701
01:39:33,626 --> 01:39:37,560
...she may be refreshed with
a conversation with our Sheikh Efendi.

702
01:39:37,993 --> 01:39:42,026
I thought that she should be refreshed
with his light before she turns...

703
01:39:42,193 --> 01:39:45,093
...herself back to darkness.
-You thought well.

704
01:39:45,426 --> 01:39:48,360
I shall inform our sheikh
and tell you his decision.

705
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,393
May God bless you.
I heard that you have a problem as well.

706
01:39:54,526 --> 01:39:56,860
We have visitors in our lodge.

707
01:39:57,326 --> 01:39:59,560
They are also going
through difficult tests.

708
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:03,960
A young girl like Leila is wounded.
The doctor did all he could but...

709
01:40:04,126 --> 01:40:07,026
...the wound is getting worse.
The cure is with God.

710
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:10,460
If the palace physician checks her,
maybe he can find a remedy.

711
01:40:10,626 --> 01:40:14,126
Of course, I will immediately
tell him to visit you tomorrow.

712
01:40:14,293 --> 01:40:16,626
The girl’s condition
is an emergency, Abla.

713
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:57,126
Do you swear on the Great Holy Quran
that you shall not be lying in court?

714
01:41:00,193 --> 01:41:01,493
I do, Efendi.

715
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:05,293
Tell everything as you
told me before, my girl...

716
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:09,293
...and do not be afraid of anyone.
What happened in that room that day?

717
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:17,193
The vizier and I went into
the room the killer was in, Efendi.

718
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:20,126
Was there anyone else who knew that room?

719
01:41:22,293 --> 01:41:24,260
What did you see when you went in?

720
01:41:32,093 --> 01:41:33,360
The man...

721
01:41:35,493 --> 01:41:38,026
...was lying down.
He started to tremble.

722
01:41:38,526 --> 01:41:42,026
Foam started coming out of his mouth,
he was poisoned.

723
01:41:44,026 --> 01:41:45,460
He died...

724
01:41:47,126 --> 01:41:49,060
...in the arms of my vizier.

725
01:41:57,626 --> 01:41:59,293
You may leave, my girl.

726
01:42:01,426 --> 01:42:03,293
We heard what we need to hear.

727
01:42:15,093 --> 01:42:16,893
The verdict is decided upon...

728
01:42:47,326 --> 01:42:49,526
The physician has completed
his examination.

729
01:42:56,326 --> 01:43:02,560
You were wise to inform us. The wound
is infected, her condition is not well.

730
01:43:03,493 --> 01:43:06,293
-I did a small surgery.
-May God bless you.

731
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:10,026
But we cannot do much here.

732
01:43:12,126 --> 01:43:16,526
She needs to be looked after in the palace
and treated with special medicine.

733
01:43:17,026 --> 01:43:21,360
We can take her to the palace. If her
condition requires it, we shall abide.

734
01:43:24,326 --> 01:43:29,993
Physician, can you tell us what to do
so that we can treat her here?

735
01:43:30,993 --> 01:43:34,126
I do not want to part with her
while she is in this condition.

736
01:43:34,293 --> 01:43:37,293
Her situation is critical,
she may not come out of this alive...

737
01:43:37,426 --> 01:43:41,460
...we did whatever can be done here,
we shall do the same in the palace.

738
01:43:42,426 --> 01:43:45,460
But only God knows
what the outcome will be.

739
01:43:46,493 --> 01:43:50,160
You can be rest assured, Efendi.
Your daughter is entrusted in me.

740
01:43:50,593 --> 01:43:52,960
I will personally tend to her.

741
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:57,193
Ummulhayl Hanim is my sister.
She will look after your daughter well...

742
01:43:57,593 --> 01:44:01,426
...in the palace and she was also
the governess of El Aziz and his sister.

743
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:05,560
Sultan Aziz is like her son.
If God permits, there'll be no problem...

744
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:07,393
...you can be rest assured.

745
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:34,510
Thank God, you are better, right?

746
01:45:35,843 --> 01:45:37,143
Thank God, Hayme.

747
01:45:38,276 --> 01:45:41,743
We have more meals to eat,
more days to see.

748
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:47,676
Yes, if God permits, we shall have
our grandchild in our arms soon.

749
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:50,843
It was time anyway.

750
01:45:51,876 --> 01:45:55,610
This is the only joyous news I heard.

751
01:45:57,010 --> 01:45:59,710
We used to yearn for
a grandchild for years.

752
01:46:00,976 --> 01:46:04,743
Gundogdu and Selcan will make us
live through that joy.

753
01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:09,676
May God give them the chance
to see their own grandchildren.

754
01:46:09,943 --> 01:46:12,543
If God permits. If God permits, Bey.

755
01:47:50,643 --> 01:47:52,610
The Emirate of Aleppo can be seen.

756
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:56,576
Put down the banner, bring the tribe flag!

757
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:58,510
Rahman! Bring my horse!

758
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:01,810
We need to enter
our new homeland on a horse.

759
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:09,710
Here you are, Bey.

760
01:49:17,010 --> 01:49:18,776
Thank you, God.

761
01:49:19,743 --> 01:49:22,210
You did not leave our tribe without a Bey.

762
01:52:06,676 --> 01:52:07,943
What is the situation?

763
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:11,543
Bey, the front door is guarded
very heavily. There is another door...

764
01:52:11,676 --> 01:52:14,943
...at the back for provisions,
we may be able to enter from there but...

765
01:52:15,143 --> 01:52:17,843
...I don't know whether
we would be able to get out.

766
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:22,310
People who heard that
the vizier is being tried have gathered.

767
01:52:22,643 --> 01:52:25,076
The guards are having
a hard time containing them.

768
01:52:25,176 --> 01:52:28,276
They are convinced that
Sahabettin Tugrul is tried unjustly.

769
01:52:29,643 --> 01:52:32,910
If we can somehow take the vizier out
we can run away in that turmoil.

770
01:52:33,043 --> 01:52:35,910
-That is all I can say, Bey.
-Do not listen to him, Bey.

771
01:52:36,043 --> 01:52:39,643
We don't know where the dungeons are.
It is very hard without help from inside.

772
01:52:39,743 --> 01:52:42,843
If you ask me, we would be caught
before we even reach Sahabettin.

773
01:52:42,943 --> 01:52:44,610
What news do you have, Bey?

774
01:52:45,076 --> 01:52:48,643
I will tell you. First we should go
to the lodge and see how Halime is.

775
01:53:08,210 --> 01:53:09,310
Yigit.

776
01:53:11,776 --> 01:53:12,910
Ertugrul.

777
01:53:14,176 --> 01:53:15,610
Poor Girl.

778
01:53:16,943 --> 01:53:18,810
Please do not worry, Numan Efendi.

779
01:53:18,943 --> 01:53:21,876
When we reach the palace
Halime will be much better.

780
01:53:24,843 --> 01:53:26,243
Hear ye, hear ye!

781
01:53:30,976 --> 01:53:32,543
Hear ye, hear ye!

782
01:53:35,143 --> 01:53:36,710
Hear ye, hear ye!

783
01:53:40,976 --> 01:53:44,310
It had been decreed that
our highness Giyaseddin El Aziz's...

784
01:53:44,643 --> 01:53:48,243
...vizier Sahabettin Tugrul has been
collaborating with the infidels...

785
01:53:48,576 --> 01:53:51,610
...and the verdict is
that he is to be executed.

786
01:53:51,776 --> 01:53:55,843
-Sahabettin is our father!
-He would never do such a thing!

787
01:54:05,243 --> 01:54:08,110
Bey, let me go and kill them.
To set an example.

788
01:54:13,210 --> 01:54:17,043
The execution shall take place today
during the afternoon prayer time.

789
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:38,710
Master...

790
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:43,810
...our fellow Muslim brother
Sahabettin Tugrul is been subjected to...

791
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:48,176
...various slanders and is being tried.

792
01:54:49,043 --> 01:54:54,843
Our hearts ache deeply for him.
What do you suggest we do?

793
01:54:57,776 --> 01:55:01,143
He Who saved Jonas from
the stomach of the fish...

794
01:55:01,876 --> 01:55:05,010
...Hiob from the worms
eating his wounds...

795
01:55:06,243 --> 01:55:08,676
...Joseph from the well...

796
01:55:09,676 --> 01:55:11,576
...Moses from the Nile...

797
01:55:13,110 --> 01:55:16,076
...and The Last Prophet from the cave...

798
01:55:18,710 --> 01:55:21,676
...would save our brother as well
if He wishes to.

799
01:55:22,876 --> 01:55:24,776
We shall take refuge in Him.

800
01:55:26,076 --> 01:55:32,043
God, Who turned the fire Abraham fell
into a rose garden...

801
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:38,643
...would turn the dungeon where
Sahabettin Tugrul is, into a womb.

802
01:55:40,643 --> 01:55:46,710
Those who wait tyranny, murder and
betrayal to emerge from there...

803
01:55:47,776 --> 01:55:51,876
...would be bewildered when
a resurrection emerges.

804
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:52,043
Do not worry, Turkmen.

805
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:57,976
When I finish with you,
you will not remember any pain...

806
01:56:58,543 --> 01:57:00,276
...from the things I did to you.

807
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:15,510
Hello, young man.

808
01:58:15,743 --> 01:58:17,543
-Who are you?
-Yigit.

809
01:58:18,310 --> 01:58:20,076
What are you doing here, Yigit?

810
01:58:20,276 --> 01:58:23,576
-I was not doing anything bad.
-Were you looking for someone?

811
01:58:26,210 --> 01:58:27,943
Would you like me to help you?

812
01:58:31,543 --> 01:58:32,710
Yes.

813
01:58:32,943 --> 01:58:34,976
Then tell me, who are you looking for?

814
01:58:35,110 --> 01:58:37,810
-My Turgut Agabey.
-Who is this Turgut Agabey.

815
01:58:38,510 --> 01:58:40,676
He is a very powerful warrior.

816
01:58:40,910 --> 01:58:43,910
He is very tall, he has very strong arms.

817
01:58:44,743 --> 01:58:48,610
So he is very powerful.
Do you like Turgut Agabey very much?

818
01:58:49,610 --> 01:58:52,610
Yes, I do. He is a very good man.

819
01:58:53,776 --> 01:58:54,876
Come.

820
02:00:20,810 --> 02:00:26,010
I am not comfortable
leaving you behind like this, Hatun.

821
02:00:26,943 --> 02:00:28,210
I don't want to.

822
02:00:28,676 --> 02:00:32,576
It is God's will, Bey. God forbid,
what if something happens to the tribe...

823
02:00:32,776 --> 02:00:35,876
...during the migration,
what would they do without Akcakoca?

824
02:00:47,876 --> 02:00:49,210
Come on, let us go in.

825
02:01:09,576 --> 02:01:12,276
Everyone thinks that this is
the wisest decision, Bey.

826
02:01:12,976 --> 02:01:15,176
You gave the best decision like a Bey.

827
02:01:19,143 --> 02:01:20,676
May God help them.

828
02:01:21,610 --> 02:01:22,776
Amen.

829
02:01:25,543 --> 02:01:27,710
Are you two ready for the journey?

830
02:01:30,876 --> 02:01:32,043
We are, Bey.

831
02:01:33,043 --> 02:01:34,210
We are.

832
02:01:36,576 --> 02:01:37,710
Come on, then.

833
02:01:40,776 --> 02:01:43,910
-In the name of God.
-In the name of God.

834
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:56,576
May God be with you, Hatun.

835
02:01:56,776 --> 02:01:58,743
May you have a clear road.

836
02:02:42,010 --> 02:02:43,110
Halt!

837
02:02:43,243 --> 02:02:44,510
Who are you?

838
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:50,310
I am from the Bozok branch of Oguz,
Bey of Kayi tribe, Suleyman Shah.

839
02:02:51,943 --> 02:02:56,110
We are going to the homeland Aleppo Ameer
Giyaseddin El Aziz gave to our tribe.

840
02:02:56,876 --> 02:03:00,543
We are here on the order of El Aziz.
You are not to enter the city...

841
02:03:01,043 --> 02:03:04,243
...and we shall escort you until
you leave the Aleppo territory.

842
02:06:22,643 --> 02:06:26,543
-Let him go, he is not a traitor!
-Let him go!

843
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:36,743
Lay Halime down there.

844
02:07:00,643 --> 02:07:03,710
-Murderers!
-Let him go!

845
02:07:04,576 --> 02:07:07,143
-You are the real murderers!
-Traitors!

846
02:07:12,910 --> 02:07:15,776
-You cannot do this!
-You murderers!

847
02:07:27,543 --> 02:07:31,710
-Traitors!
-Murderers!

848
02:07:50,510 --> 02:07:53,710
-Traitors!
-Murderers!

849
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:34,043
Vizier, do you have a last word?

850
02:08:43,176 --> 02:08:45,243
Do not remember me as a traitor!

851
02:08:47,276 --> 02:08:50,876
Whatever I did,
I did for the future of our people.

852
02:08:53,143 --> 02:08:56,176
Quran is my guide and God is my witness!

853
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:00,110
My head is up!

854
02:09:00,776 --> 02:09:02,110
My cause is God!

855
02:09:05,210 --> 02:09:07,643
If I need to die for this cause...

856
02:09:09,610 --> 02:09:11,010
...whether in sleep...

857
02:09:14,210 --> 02:09:15,743
...or with an axe!
