You Tube search name - 
Mirza Sahiban

3
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,390
Listen to what youth says

4
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,610
It says that hearts
should come together

5
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,010
The closed bud should open...

6
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,660
and be strung into a garland

7
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,100
It says, someone should just appear...

8
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,140
mingle with the breath...

9
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,890
and fall in love

10
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,250
Someone should come laughing...

11
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,280
and give rise to sweet longing...

12
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,360
in my heart

13
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,840
- Who are you?
- An archer!

14
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,950
May Allah pierce
your heart with this arrow.

15
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,000
- Shameless! Aren't you ashamed?
- If one is, he's unlucky.

16
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,580
If not, one gets milk and honey.

17
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,320
You see?

18
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,140
Just wait. I'll tell your mother.

19
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,610
My name's not Rakho
if you're still in one piece.

20
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,580
And my name's not Mirza
if you have a single water pot left.

21
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,790
Just wait. Come on, let's get him.

22
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,660
- Chachi (aunt) salaam.
- Live long, son.

23
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,280
- Where are you going?
- Chaudhary's, to give butter.

24
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,660
Butter? Chachi, look.

25
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,880
Oh! My butter!

26
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,730
Scoundrel.
May your funeral take place.

27
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,160
- Chacha salaam.
- Live long, son.

28
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,550
Congrats on winning the court
case, chacha. You're avoiding us.

29
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,590
- Afraid of giving sweets?
- Sweets aren't better than you, son?

30
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,650
- Forget sweets, just shake hands.
- Of course.

31
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,636
Ill mannered scoundrel.

32
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,316
(A rhyming untranslatable childish retort)

33
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,480
I'll tell your mother.
Such a child should be strangled.

34
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,120
- One day I'll do that too. Salaam Chacha.
- Salaam indeed.

35
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,840
- Miyanji's (teacher) coming.
- Quiet.

36
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,470
- Oh, the devil.
- Miyanji, what's the devil done to you?

37
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,010
- Why are you cursing him?
- So it's you, good for nothing.

38
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,750
- Son of the devil. I'll tell your mother.
- Go on miyanji.

39
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,610
Another one makes no difference.
Hurry up. Go.

40
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,560
Your annoying boy breaks our water
pots every day. What should we do?

41
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,086
- How can we manage?
- Today was my 16th water pot.

42
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,840
And my 18th, my 18th.

43
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,890
Not only that,
today my butter pot too.

44
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,350
Let him come.

45
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,860
Brother. Are you listening to
your dear nephew's pranks?

46
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,240
I'm tired of these complaints.

47
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,150
- Salaam, sister.
- Salaam brother.

48
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,260
I've brought a complaint.
Your son didn't shake hands with me.

49
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,970
If it's so important, I will.

50
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,340
I'd make mincemeat
of such a child of mine.

51
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,800
Useless birth.

52
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,890
Chachi, what did he say to you?

53
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,010
He ate all my butter.

54
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,730
What should I give Chaudhary now?
His liver?

55
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,930
My God! Such a bad son?

56
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,390
He stole all my sweets.

57
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,090
Can such a boy go to paradise?

58
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,420
- Impossible.
- You'll go there before he does.

59
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,810
See brother, the day has just started.

60
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,200
He's made my life impossible.

61
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,980
I wish I could drown myself
in a well...

62
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,910
or take poison.

63
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,110
Children are always
mischievous at this age.

64
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,120
My children too.

65
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,050
Not like him.

66
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,880
He's out since morning...

67
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,830
without food or water.
Let him come.

68
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,660
- Ma, Mirza's here.
- So, you're back?

69
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,230
You're all here. Go away.

70
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,980
I'll shut you all up
with just one arrow.

71
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,240
You've worn me out mentally.

72
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,380
Today I'll slaughter you.

73
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,690
- Don't come near me.
- Silly archer.

74
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,230
Move away.

75
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,660
Why hit her? Come hit me.

76
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,820
How does that help.

77
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,730
What are you looking at.
Go away.

78
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,270
I'll beat him.
I'll drink his blood.

79
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,600
We'll break his head if he
breaks our pots ever again.

80
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,750
Do that.

81
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,570
Kill him.

82
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,340
Is that enough?
Go away now.

83
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,060
Why did you hit Chatti?
You should've hit me.

84
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,570
My children.

85
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,180
You're a mother.
You won't be able to beat them.

86
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,420
What to do?
The entire village is fed up with him.

87
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,040
They always complain.

88
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,810
He's so difficult.

89
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,660
Sister, a day'll come...

90
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,910
when the whole village
will praise Mirza.

91
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,600
He'll get educated,
and become a respectable young man.

92
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,980
He? He'll become respectable?

93
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,560
The villagers will always curse him.

94
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,380
He'll face hurdles.

95
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,880
But he won't remain here.

96
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,320
I'll take him with me.

97
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,150
And when he returns
a young man...

98
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,430
you'll call your son a diamond.

99
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,260
Honestly, brother?

100
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,530
Take him, and make him a human.

101
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,100
Yes, sister, when he returns...

102
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,040
you'll be proud of him.

103
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,090
God bless you, brother.

104
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,780
If my going makes you happy,
I won't go.

105
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,420
Let it be. Come on, son.

106
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,670
Whose son? Get lost.

107
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,980
Come on my dear.

108
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,620
Okay, but how'll we go?

109
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,350
- On foot.
- Go alone.

110
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,440
- On horseback?
- Yes, only then.

111
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,100
- When will you be back, brother?
- Whenever I want.

112
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,330
Take food for the journey.

113
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,760
No need.
Get my bow and arrow.

114
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,030
Okay, sister, and listen.

115
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,150
If Mirza doesn't return,
his bow will.

116
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,770
- Okay amma, salaam.
- Live long, son.

117
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,440
Let's go, mamu (uncle).

118
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,360
Oh, dear.

119
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,270
May Allah break your hands
for breaking my beautiful water pot.

120
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,360
- Who are you?
- I'm Mirza.

121
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,760
Why did you shoot this arrow?

122
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,840
- I always shoot arrows.
- Idiotic archer.

123
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,790
- Was this your father's pot?
- No, but my mamu's.

124
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,100
He's right. He's my nephew.
I've brought him back with me.

125
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,800
Of course.
After all he's your sister's son.

126
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,530
I've asked you
to think of my sister's son.

127
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,920
Help him,
but Chaudhary sahab won't.

128
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,500
- Okay, mamu, give.
- What?

129
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,440
- I'm going.
- Where? - Home.

130
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,290
I won't survive here.

131
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,570
Yes, humiliate me.

132
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,680
Just brought him over from sister's.

133
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,810
Any more insults for Chaudhary
in front of this child?

134
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,140
Pacify him or else he'll go away.
Do you hear?

135
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,200
- Yes.
- Then be good to him.

136
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,060
- Mirza, you'll stay with me.
- Think over it first.

137
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,720
- Yes, I have. Go and play.
- Mamu, should I?

138
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,620
Yes, son. Go and play.

139
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,870
Hope miyanji falls ill today

140
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,830
It will be fun

141
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,740
Hope our prayers are heard

142
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,960
I'll sit here and teach everyone

143
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,920
For one mistake,
I'll slipper them four times...

144
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,270
and lead him by his
ears outside the village

145
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,330
Our prayers are answered.

146
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,580
- How?
- Miyanji is really ill.

147
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,800
- He's ill?
Today's a holiday.

148
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,460
(Children playing a game
of flying like a butterfly...)

149
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,750
(and finding rhythm
in rhyming words...)

150
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,020
(none of which
make sense if translated.)

151
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,690
I hope you die, ugly face.

152
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,720
You die, you fat nosed.

153
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,580
Your nose is like
a scoundrel's fat thumb.

154
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,350
I'll strangle you.

155
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,460
- I'll break your teeth.
- Have you seen your own?

156
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,410
Who are you?

157
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,510
- I'm Mirza.
- Oh, hang Mirza.

158
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,420
Swearing?

159
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,850
Forgive me.

160
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,290
- Will you ever fight with her again?
- No.

161
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,720
You're very nice.
Who are you?

162
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,030
- I'm Mirza.
- Won't you ask me my name?

163
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,930
Why should I bother?

164
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,420
Then why fight for me?

165
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,110
- That's my habit.
- Will you play with me?

166
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,090
No, I don't play with girls.

167
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,130
Then with whom?

168
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,860
- With my bow and arrow.
- Idiotic archer.

169
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,110
- Why are you following me?
- I don't follow girls. I'm going home.

170
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,920
- Then walk at a distance.
- How, when our way is one.

171
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,250
So stubborn.

172
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,100
- You won't listen?
- You too.

173
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,680
- Me?
- Yes. Why are you walking with me?

174
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,320
- It's you, following me.
- I've come home.

175
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,500
Shall I call my abba (father)?

176
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,930
- Call.
- Abba! - Mamu!

177
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,820
- What's it Sahiban?
- Brother, he's teasing me.

178
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,490
Really? I'll deal with him.

179
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,219
Why are you teasing her?

180
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,110
What are you doing?
Brothers fighting with each other?

181
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,010
- Yes, son. This is Mirza.
- Who cares?

182
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,150
Whatever.
You have to live here together...

183
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,580
and play together.

184
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,320
- Are you reading or staring at me?
- Think what you wish.

185
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,470
- Look at the book.
- What's there in the book?

186
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,580
A B C D

187
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,560
Also on your face.

188
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,750
- On my face?
- Yes.

189
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,840
Your nose is A...

190
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,660
eyes B, forehead with chin J.

191
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,800
Get up from here.

192
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,650
- Why?
- It's my place.

193
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,860
Oh. So you
wish to sit near Sahiban.

194
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,390
And I should get up?

195
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,150
- I'll teach you a lesson.
- Miyanji!

196
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,480
Who cares for miyanji.

197
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,870
Is this a classroom or a fighting ring?

198
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,630
Mirza wants to sit in my place.

199
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,200
So you're Mirza.

200
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,510
Chaudhary was praising you.

201
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,370
- Go and sit at the back.
- You're siding with him.

202
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,350
- That's unfair.
- Go or I'll smack you.

203
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,740
- I'll shoot an arrow at you.
- Go on. Move back.

204
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,530
- Sit.
- I will.

205
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,350
You too.

206
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,250
Miyanji,
I can't see Sahiban from here.

207
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,910
I'll show you Sahiban,
you scoundrel.

208
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,910
You've come to learn
or look at Sahiban?

209
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,440
Quiet.

210
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,490
Now answer my questions.

211
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,910
Sahiban. Listen.

212
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,810
If your ma had Rs 10...

213
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,270
and from that your father
takes Rs 5. What's left?

214
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,850
- A quarrel.
- A quarrel?

215
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,220
- What are you saying?
- She's right.

216
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,700
- Her ma never lets out a paisa.
- Quiet.

217
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,500
Bhuman. If your father
buys flour for 1 paisa...

218
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,090
sugar for 2, and ghee for 3 paisa...

219
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,730
- what do you get altogether?
- Halwa.

220
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,330
I'll get some for you too.

221
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,010
Miyanji, Mirza's sitting
near Sahiban again.

222
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,680
- You've come back?
- Just drifted here with my laughter.

223
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,790
Alright. Bhuman, give Mirza a gift.

224
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,540
Okay, miyanji.

225
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,430
Get up. Hold your ears.

226
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,690
- Stop joking.
- Hold your ears.

227
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,600
- Miyanji's orders.
- Let miyanji demonstrate first.

228
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,540
Good for nothing.
Bhuman, show him.

229
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,900
Hold your ears.
Not like that. Bend.

230
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,030
Did you enjoy school, son?

231
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,360
That's the problem.
Miyanji beat me today.

232
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,910
He boxed my ears.
I sit where I can't see Sahiban.

233
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,840
You go to learn or watch Sahiban?

234
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,570
Shamir. Idiot. Go away.

235
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,610
You shouldn't fight.
Sit down.

236
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,680
Son, I've promised your mother...

237
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,440
that I'll educate you well.

238
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,490
C'mon, learn.

239
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,920
Five and five are ten.

240
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,240
- Mirza.
- Yes, miyanji?

241
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,650
- Where are you sitting?
- Near Sahiban.

242
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,100
Mirza talks under your nose,
and sits in my place.

243
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,760
Really? He deserves a gift.

244
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,470
Mirza. There's
an excellent place for you.

245
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,270
Come here.

246
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,520
Pick up your bag.

247
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,040
Don't stand there.
Come here.

248
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,010
Go on. Sit there.

249
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,050
From here I can't see Sahiban at all.

250
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,480
You don't see her? And now?

251
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,260
- No.
- Quiet. Sit down.

252
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,030
Rehmu, how many rivers
are there in Punjab?

253
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,530
- I'll ask a fisherman.
- Stupid.

254
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,150
The school's full of idiots.

255
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,820
Sit down. Sit.

256
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,760
Sahiban, what's the
capital city of Punjab?

257
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,780
Don't you know anything, miyanji?

258
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,510
I hope miyanji dies.

259
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,960
- He's so poisonous.
- Why?

260
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:06,350
He's always beating you,
never Bhuman.

261
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,330
- I deal with Bhuman myself.
- But miyanji's bad.

262
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,690
He's always getting angry.
Could it get worse?

263
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,100
He can beat me more if he likes.

264
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,700
So, you're talking about
miyanji behind his back?

265
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,910
- I'll go and tell him.
- You've appeared here too?

266
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,560
Don't run. I'll shoot an arrow.

267
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,520
Hold your ears,
or here comes an arrow.

268
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,760
I swear I'm being tortured.

269
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,350
Father used to say,
ears are for hearing...

270
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,660
but I've found out, they're not.

271
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,110
They're for holding.

272
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,100
You'll fall. Let me help you.

273
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,830
Oh. They're holding hands

274
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,900
I can't bear this.

275
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,410
He's making love
under my nose...

276
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,030
and I'm watching,
holding my ears?

277
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,410
Anyone here?
Such unbearable torture.

278
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,640
My heart's being shattered.

279
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,390
Let him go.
People will hear him shouting.

280
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,680
Go Bhuman. I'm releasing you
because Sahiban asked.

281
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,390
Oh, really?
I'll see that this romance ends.

282
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,570
He saw you hold my hands.

283
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,180
He'll spread it around
and defame us.

284
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,110
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

285
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,670
We are as we always were
since childhood.

286
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,010
That was childhood, this is youth.

287
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,180
Childhood games become fire in youth.

288
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,210
I don't know all that, Sahiban.

289
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,200
But yes, today when
I touched your hand...

290
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,500
I felt a shock in my body.

291
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,750
When you held my hands in childhood,
it never happened.

292
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,260
Sahiban, do you know
what this means?

293
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,520
The heart knows,
and the heart has no tongue.

294
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,700
So, how can I tell?

295
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,500
On one hand the heart
is dancing with joy...

296
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,210
and on the other,
it beats with fright.

297
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,870
Afraid of whom?

298
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,430
If someone sees us and...

299
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,700
gossip spreads in the village...

300
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,440
what if the family hears of it?

301
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,810
I don't care what happens.

302
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:48,150
Sahiban, promise we won't ever part.

303
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,460
The world can't say anything.
We've been like this since childhood.

304
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,940
The cruel world
accepts childhood games...

305
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,616
but not those of youth.

306
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,850
Sahiban, why care about the world
when we have our own?

307
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,280
Look, nature is celebrating our meeting.

308
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,180
Look, that pair of birds
is chirping with happiness.

309
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,910
Like them, we'll make a home one day...

310
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,830
with the twigs of love...

311
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,890
and decorate it
with flowers of happiness.

312
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,930
- Mirza.
- What?

313
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,440
One flew away.

314
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,060
The other's left alone.

315
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,940
So what?
Sometimes separation is part of love.

316
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,830
And then, reuniting.

317
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,390
What are you thinking?

318
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,370
I'm afraid the world
might separate us.

319
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,870
Like this bird,
Sahiban might get left alone.

320
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,670
Sahiban, as long as your love
abides in my heart...

321
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,930
and there's a bow and arrow
in my hands...

322
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,910
no force can separate us.

323
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,860
I believe that, but Mirza...

324
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,120
show the world your courage.

325
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,180
We're all going to the village fair.
You come too.

326
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,400
No, that's a worldly fair.

327
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,320
This one is of our hearts,
beating in togetherness.

328
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,270
Today my son will stand out
at the fair.

329
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,506
Shamir, let me put a black
mark to avoid any evil eye.

330
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,380
Your's will be the first eye.

331
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,860
I'm a mother, not a witch.

332
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,460
Don't interfere.

333
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,296
- Look, I've changed.
- Well done.

334
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,820
Beti, bring some soot.

335
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,700
- Shamir.
- Who, Bhuman? Come in.

336
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,780
Come here, I want to say something.

337
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,590
Look. My dupatta is so nice.

338
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,730
Very nice.

339
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,190
And brother, look...

340
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,070
it's of silk, from Bukhara.

341
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,910
I'm sure it is.

342
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,166
You forgot the black mark.

343
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,020
Oh, I forgot. Come, son.

344
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,470
You dare not tell Shamir anything.

345
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,380
Or else get beaten by Mirza.

346
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,810
I won't say anything.

347
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,290
- Not the whole face.
- No, son.

348
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,780
- Finished?
- Yes.

349
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,100
- Okay. I'll go now.
- Bhuman.

350
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,746
- What happened?
- Nothing. I... I...

351
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,570
Just came to ask
if you're going to the fair.

352
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,256
Of course.

353
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,930
Okay. So, I'll go now.

354
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,370
Crazy.

355
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,980
One of you, come forward.

356
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,710
- Bhuman. go.
- Who me? No. You go.

357
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,320
- Don't worry. I'm staying here.
- No, no. - Go.

358
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,160
I'm saying, go!
What can he do to you?

359
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,650
Here, I am.

360
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,070
- I'm freeing the animal. - Okay.
- You'll hit it or run?

361
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,300
- I'll hit.
- But don't run. Shall I? - Yes.

362
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,556
- He's very clever.
- Me too.

363
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,616
- He's very strong.
- Me too.

364
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,420
- He's a rascal.
- You are too.

365
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,370
Did you see Mirza's punch, Noora?

366
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,600
- Two lions in combat.
- Keep quiet. What's wrong with you?

367
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,760
This girl is very shameless.

368
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,630
She's shameless.

369
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,270
She roams around
with that brawny Mirza.

370
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,530
- Did you see that?
- Yes, for a long time.

371
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,060
Chaudhary's honor is
in God's hands now.

372
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,380
I agree. This has gone too far.

373
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,050
I've seen them meeting on the sly.

374
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,350
You'll see a lot more.
Youth is crazy.

375
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,810
I agree.

376
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,290
Oh my, it's flying in the wind...

377
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,200
this silk dupatta of mine

378
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,990
A blast of sweet wind...

379
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,650
gave a sweet message

380
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,760
By mistake don't accept...

381
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,620
a stranger's hand

382
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,530
This is the advice of my silk dupatta

383
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,660
The one following behind...

384
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,000
don't get left behind

385
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,750
I fear the uneventful passing...

386
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,670
of this pleasant season, my beloved

387
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,600
This is the sweet song of the dupatta

388
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,120
The sun is setting
with a wish in its heart

389
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,399
Two hearts are far apart

390
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,310
How to get them close?

391
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,140
The silk dupatta
will bring the hearts together

392
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,490
- Come on six.
- No six. Three.

393
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,900
Come blow on it.

394
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,940
- A twelve. It's dead.
- Let her die.

395
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,310
- She's no use to me.
- If not to you...

396
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,460
- it's useful to me.
- Why man?

397
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,580
- Are you going to take to the bottle?
- What rubbish.

398
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,550
At least two girls are crazy about me.

399
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,480
- Have you seen yourself in a mirror?
- Why?

400
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,810
The one you're crazy about...

401
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,090
she goes about with Mirza.

402
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,800
What? What do you mean?

403
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,730
Don't pretend.

404
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,940
Do you know anything about Sahiban?

405
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,860
It's Mirza she...

406
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,110
meets up with in the forest.

407
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,690
Meets him in the forest?

408
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,000
- If it's untrue I'll cut off your nose.
- Sure.

409
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,630
- Show me.
- Immediately. Come on.

410
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,780
- Shamir. Good you're here.
- Why?

411
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,880
- It's disgraceful.
- What's the matter?

412
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,810
- Tell him.
- He'll kill me.

413
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,580
I won't tell.

414
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,470
What's the matter Bhuman?
Tell me.

415
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,570
It's difficult, Shamir.

416
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,800
- What are you saying?
- Come and see.

417
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,700
Chaudhary, you come too.

418
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:36,430
Your hands on my chest
will give me peace

419
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:49,090
My bleak heart will bloom

420
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:11,340
My heart tells me
to hide you in my eyes

421
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:23,920
The only fear is of provoking destiny

422
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:57,240
Treat my wounded heart
with the balm of your love

423
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:09,940
So I can get some respite
from this restlessness

424
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,930
For God's sake don't
take away my consciousness

425
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:51,570
Don't look at me this way,
as it intoxicates me

426
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:25,010
You too will leave like luck does

427
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,720
And then death will be attractive

428
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,190
Brother!

429
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,220
Don't call me brother,
and disgrace the word.

430
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,710
I feel ashamed to call you sister.

431
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,460
A decent family's respect...

432
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,730
you've placed at the feet
of a vagabond?

433
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,680
Vagabond? True love cannot
make one a vagabond.

434
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,180
You're disgusting. A sinner.

435
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,140
But love isn't a sin.

436
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,070
I respect you...

437
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,600
because someone dear to me...

438
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,710
loves you.

439
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,810
Your bitter words are sweet...

440
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,100
- and curses are blessings.
- You're foolish.

441
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,690
You roar like a lion
but have a heart like a jackal.

442
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,100
Who's a coward has been seen by all.

443
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,930
You think you're brave?
Can you take a beating?

444
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,370
Who's brave has been seen by all.

445
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,850
Pick up your bow and arrow.
Let's see.

446
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,880
Don't mention bow and arrow.

447
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,100
Once the arrow takes position
it won't stop.

448
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,250
You've taken his name again?

449
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,220
Move away.

450
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,700
You're putting your hands in fire.

451
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,050
You're trying my patience.

452
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,880
I don't want to raise my hands
against you for anyone.

453
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,900
You don't have the strength.

454
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,790
That's why you're standing so far away?

455
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,000
Don't dare step forward Shamir.

456
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,880
If you have the strength,
defend against my attack.

457
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,530
Strength?

458
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,380
These iron hands which can break this...

459
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,940
can also crush your bones.

460
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,620
I swear on my love,
if I hadn't eaten your father's salt...

461
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,560
if my heart wasn't filled
with love for Sahiban...

462
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,530
I would have pierced
your heart with one arrow.

463
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,900
We'll see who's heart gets pierced.

464
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,270
It's best to go away quietly...

465
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,596
as the family honor
will suffer either way.

466
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,620
So save your own face,
and come away.

467
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,420
I swear on my honor...

468
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,670
if you ever step inside the house...

469
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,080
if I ever see you talking to Sahiban...

470
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,230
I'll cut you both into pieces.

471
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,510
Come on.

472
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,640
- Have you heard, sister?
- What?

473
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,570
About Sahiban and Mirza.

474
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:26,940
- The whole village knows.
- She got caught today.

475
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,780
Shamir caught them both.

476
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,600
Dear God. What a girl.

477
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,760
What a shame. Did you see...

478
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,560
- Sahiban's behavior?
- Yes.

479
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,550
The world has turned, son.

480
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:42,420
- What now?
- Her parents should know.

481
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,700
What is it?

482
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,100
- Why are you nervous?
- She's asking why I'm nervous.

483
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,476
You should be getting nervous...

484
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,130
the one being dishonored.

485
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:56,610
- What are you saying?
- Not just me, the whole world.

486
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,640
Mirza and Sahiban misbehaved at the fair.

487
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,370
Aunt, I can't walk in the street anymore.

488
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,660
Some say Mirza
has dishonored the family.

489
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,060
Others say Sahiban
has let down her family.

490
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,320
There are voices saying...

491
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,070
why was shameless Mirza
allowed to stay here.

492
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,910
Others say he's a snake in the grass.

493
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,050
He bit the hands that fed him.

494
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,470
Aunt, Mirza has destroyed you.

495
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:31,580
Just step out and hear
what people are saying.

496
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,300
Yes, that Mirza...

497
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,990
and your Sahiban.

498
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,390
Truth is stranger than fiction...

499
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,360
they are so mismatched.

500
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:47,480
I knew this scoundrel would show
his true colors one day.

501
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,700
I'll cut him into pieces.

502
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,070
I'll break Sahiban's hands and feet.

503
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,100
Watch what I do to Mirza today.

504
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,300
What do we care
what happens to him?

505
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,440
I was left gawking...

506
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,550
when I begged, pleaded,
fell at your feet...

507
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,770
for Sahiban's hand.

508
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,440
But nobody cared?

509
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,590
Anyway who cares. It's you...

510
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,610
who's the loser.
Such a son-in-law...

511
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,000
is unmatched, and unique.

512
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,520
First let me kick him
out of the house...

513
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,710
then we'll see.
There's no one better than you.

514
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:29,860
That's true, but what about him?

515
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:33,170
He's the problem, aunt.

516
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,090
The crow's enjoying...

517
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,600
and the swan's crying.

518
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,210
Your ways are strange, God.

519
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,060
Very very strange.

520
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,960
Okay, I'm going. I'll come again.

521
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,070
When I come back, that scoundrel...

522
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,320
shouldn't be seen here.

523
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,050
Then you'll prove
to really be my aunt.

524
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,030
And tell Sahiban...

525
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,040
Nothing, nothing. See you.

526
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,700
Ma, why did you
turn your face away?

527
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:26,740
Don't call me mother.
My daughter can't be so low down.

528
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,420
She can't be so shameless.

529
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,900
Instead of youth, death should
have come upon you.

530
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,360
To see your grave
would've been better.

531
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,140
I have no one but you.

532
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,860
If you turn away...

533
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,510
I'll ask for death.

534
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,480
When you were born...

535
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,810
I should have strangled you.

536
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,960
Then I wouldn't have
to witness our dishonor.

537
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,850
Strangle me, ma.

538
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,110
Then, in the presence of god...

539
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,490
I can display my broken heart, and ask...

540
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,860
you maker of this world...

541
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,920
why did you make youth...

542
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,920
and if you did,
then why make love?

543
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,170
I'll be indebted to you ma,
if you strangle me.

544
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,540
I'll get peace only when...

545
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,880
I see Mirza's corpse.

546
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,900
Ma, say what you want
to me, but spare him.

547
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,530
Shamir has beaten him badly.

548
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:34,140
He must have left, repeating my name.

549
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,080
I won't go without meeting you.

550
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,590
You can't meet her anymore.

551
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,370
- Sahiban.
- You want to see Sahiban?

552
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,010
- Yes, please.
- Okay, wait.

553
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,440
I'll show you Sahiban.

554
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,640
Even if death comes...

555
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,990
I don't care.

556
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,810
Beat me till you're satisfied.

557
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,630
Blood?

558
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,270
Did you beat him?

559
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,420
Smashed his head?

560
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,430
What will the world say?

561
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,326
Go and see
what the world is saying.

562
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:50,130
Your honor, respect and grandeur...

563
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,610
are the target of the people.

564
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:55,230
She was running away with him.

565
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,400
Go and drown in shame.

566
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,610
- Mirza.
- Hey you!

567
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,550
- You've come back?
- Shamir.

568
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,280
Father, don't interfere.

569
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,380
What are you doing, Samir?
Oh, no.

570
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,290
Mirza, look at your state, my child.

571
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,880
You can see his state,
but not his misbehavior.

572
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,160
- Move, aunt.
- How can I? Your heart's of stone.

573
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,160
Mine isn't.
You're inhuman and cruel.

574
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
Everyone has bloodied him.

575
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,370
Aunt, no one has bloodied me.

576
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,280
I invited it myself.

577
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,580
But I can't see my sister's beloved son...

578
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,470
bathed in blood.

579
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:41,290
Sister, you don't have a heart.

580
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,200
Chaudhary, you do justice in the village.

581
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,240
Your nephew soaked in blood
is standing before you.

582
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,240
But you're being unjust.

583
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,520
Let me get destroyed, aunt.

584
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,400
Let my blood run.

585
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,160
It will help our love to blossom...

586
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,000
get stronger, facing obstacles.

587
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,110
I'll ask him for justice. Uncle!

588
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:13,010
The world doesn't know me,
but you do.

589
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,520
After leaving mother...

590
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,960
I took shelter with you.

591
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,250
If you too think I'm guilty...

592
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,870
then here's my head at your feet.

593
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,100
Take my life with my bow and arrow.

594
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:41,300
- Father, first shoot the arrow at me.
- Father what are you waiting for?

595
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,160
Shoot the arrow.

596
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,200
Get up.

597
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,240
Before I say anything...

598
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,590
take your bow and arrow and go away.

599
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,870
My head was bashed...

600
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,240
I didn't bother.

601
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,050
My blood flowed...

602
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,200
I didn't moan.

603
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,830
But you've broken my heart.

604
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,590
I'm going.
God be with you Sahiban.

605
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,070
Sahiban, the arrow has left the bow.

606
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,160
Don't leave me Mirza.

607
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,210
We may part in life...

608
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,250
but we'll die together.

609
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,160
This I promise.

610
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,400
Don't cry, Sahiban.

611
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,190
It was destiny's wish.

612
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,320
Will you go or not?

613
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,290
- Look, eleven.
- Not eleven. Two.

614
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:48,480
You won't get 11 even in 11 years.

615
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,060
Watch this, with your eyes open.

616
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,080
- Here take 25.
- It really is 25.

617
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,150
Why not?

618
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,940
My dear I've
been playing for 25 years.

619
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:05,140
- Take this. Give it in my hand.
- You keep it.

620
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,260
Boss, did you start
soon after your birth?

621
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,090
What would you know?

622
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,310
Watch this.

623
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,430
Eleven.

624
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,860
You're blocked.

625
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:20,060
So what?
I'll set it free in one turn.

626
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,980
That's very difficult.

627
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,900
It's also a...

628
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,920
deadly move.

629
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,940
There's no comparison...

630
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:33,280
in the whole of Punjab.

631
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,510
You haven't seen his hands yet.

632
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,690
What? My hands?

633
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,950
Ask Mirza. That day...

634
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:44,150
I gave him one.
My finger marks got printed.

635
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,580
Really?

636
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,300
The whole village knows
and you ask, 'really?'

637
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,836
That's why we don't see him.

638
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,640
How will you see him?

639
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,870
Can he face men?

640
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:59,330
How he strutted around
with bow and arrow in hand.

641
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,210
Your ways are strange, God.

642
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,240
Very very strange.

643
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,250
But where has Mirza gone?

644
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:13,450
Forget about it. He must
be somewhere struggling.

645
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:24,810
Too many places...

646
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,510
where youth suffers

647
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,796
Too many places where...

648
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,800
my story has become disreputable

649
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,630
You who's mourning...

650
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:04,470
now even your...

651
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:10,190
support has collapsed

652
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:32,320
Too many places where the
flow of my tears will reach

653
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:03,870
The garden which the eyes discovered...

654
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:10,790
got destroyed

655
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,810
Too many places
to shower my tears on

656
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,120
There's a plea on my lips...

657
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,720
tears in my eyes...

658
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:08,540
and a stained heart.

659
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:30,770
Too many places where
I've hidden your memories

660
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:00,440
So much has happened.
Both went to the fair.

661
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,470
They talked.

662
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,650
As they were young,
people observed this.

663
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:08,440
There was gossip.
They were shamed.

664
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,030
Shamir flew into a rage.

665
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:14,370
He was badly beaten and injured.

666
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,780
All because of Sahiban.

667
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,260
She fooled my innocent brother...

668
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,040
and got him beaten.

669
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,440
Her youth should have perished.

670
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,180
That witch should have died.

671
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,820
Chaudhary, you promised
to educate my son...

672
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,500
and make him
into a good human being.

673
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:39,100
You did very well, brother.

674
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:43,970
Sister, why didn't you
bring him with you?

675
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,430
Mirza heeds no one.

676
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,310
Day and night he chants her name.

677
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,570
I asked him to, but he wanted...

678
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,470
to go to Sahiban's.

679
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,200
Aunt, tell my brother...

680
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,080
your mare, Neeli, thinks of you...

681
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,580
and your sister's very ill...

682
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,600
and might die.

683
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:09,850
He should come for her funeral.

684
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,440
He's sure to come then.

685
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,700
He'll forget Sahiban and come.

686
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:30,250
Far far from my eyes...

687
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:34,800
the sleep has gone... far

688
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,280
Sorrow, my companion...

689
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:48,360
hit so hard
that it smashed my heart

690
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,340
My companion, my beloved...

691
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:08,990
I hold no grudge against destiny...

692
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:14,780
nor blame you at all...

693
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:25,710
for bringing me to foreign lands...

694
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,520
and taking away all from me

695
00:58:52,840 --> 00:59:00,840
Tears reside in my eyes,
and I'm forced to cry

696
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:14,250
My wounds, oh foreigner,
by constant pain...

697
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,430
have become sores

698
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:37,930
After making me love sick...

699
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:41,870
sorrow is my illness now

700
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:53,110
My burning flame...

701
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,530
has been extinguished by my destiny

702
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:30,100
It's not my fault.
I've been deceived by destiny

703
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,700
Food is like poison.
I can't eat it.

704
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,660
Sahiban is hungry,
so also that unlucky Mirza.

705
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,520
Father, you've taken his name again.

706
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:14,350
Let him die of hunger.

707
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,340
Pray for Mirza's death after...

708
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,710
you've saved your daughter's life.

709
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,160
She's crying away crazily.

710
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,270
Would it have been a disaster
if they'd married?

711
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,630
Marriage with Mirza? Father...

712
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:30,770
if you ever mention it again...

713
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,790
I won't stay here a moment longer.

714
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,440
I wish to smash his head...

715
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,260
and you wish to tie
the sehra on his head?

716
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,500
Yes, tie the sehra on his head.

717
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:44,406
Get them married, and...

718
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,150
complete our disgrace.

719
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:49,040
Mirza has left home,
but not your heart.

720
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,520
Bhuman's name enrages you.

721
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,680
What does he have
that Bhuman doesn't?

722
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,830
I'll get Sahiban married to Bhuman.

723
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,940
He's decent from a decent family.

724
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,060
He's well off,
not a beggar like Mirza.

725
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,870
You can pine away for him.
I have to save the family's honor.

726
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,010
Honor?
You'll pay a heavy price for it.

727
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:11,050
Your eyes will open...

728
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,070
the day Mirza's corpse
will lie on one side...

729
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:15,900
your daughter's on the other.

730
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,890
Your maternal feelings have died.

731
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:22,140
You have a stone instead of a heart.

732
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,750
I've said all I wanted.

733
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:26,860
From today, I'll say no more.

734
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,150
Save your honor.
Glorify your family name.

735
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,390
Wash the disgrace.

736
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,620
But remember...

737
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:39,120
one day you'll
be left with false pride.

738
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,700
You'll have no daughter.

739
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,200
Sahiban, what's the matter with you?

740
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,090
Your eyes are swollen from crying.

741
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,270
They'll cry for the rest of my life.

742
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:53,720
Tears will not put out this fire.

743
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:55,590
Be patient.

744
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,820
How?

745
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,630
Youth has deceived you, crazy girl.

746
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,920
No, Noora.

747
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:07,310
My destiny has deceived me.

748
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,550
What you thought were flowers,
was smoldering coal.

749
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:13,710
But I see only flowers.

750
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,510
When it all burns without smoke...

751
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,260
you'll know then.

752
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:22,510
I hope all that's mine,
burns to ashes...

753
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,660
and the breeze take the ashes,
and lays it at Mirza's feet.

754
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:29,990
Sahiban, I fear you'll go mad.

755
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,480
That'll be good.

756
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:34,880
There'll be no one to stop me.

757
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,830
I'll become a mendicant,
begging for my love in the streets.

758
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:42,270
Sahiban, think of your old father.

759
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:44,910
People are pointing their fingers
at you all.

760
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:48,680
Forget Mirza.
He's the enemy of your honor.

761
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,580
You come with a spear too?

762
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,330
My wound is still not healed.

763
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,690
Go away from here.

764
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,500
Friend, are you annoyed?

765
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,190
I considered you a sister.

766
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,560
But you turned out a stranger.

767
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,370
I thought you'd
soothe my wounds like balm.

768
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:11,190
But you've hurt me.

769
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,400
Forgive me sister
for giving you pain.

770
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,500
Your wound is worse than destiny's.

771
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,120
You've become an enemy like the rest.

772
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,990
No Sahiban.
Wish I could take away your pain.

773
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,880
If you wish you could.

774
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,970
Me? How?

775
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,140
Noora...

776
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,200
Look into my damp eyes...

777
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:41,160
and see for whom they are restless.

778
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,620
I know for whom.

779
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,760
Noora, for God's sake be kind to me.

780
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,800
Take pity on Mirza.

781
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,840
He's a poor foreigner here.

782
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:56,530
Even the air here is his enemy.

783
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:00,140
Go and console him.

784
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:02,350
What should I tell him?

785
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,370
Nothing.

786
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:07,740
Just arrange a meeting.

787
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,330
We'll tell each other ourselves.

788
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,560
Go, dear Noora. Go.

789
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,760
Who?

790
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,950
Your unfortunate aunt.

791
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,090
I've brought a message.

792
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:26,170
Sahiban's? You're so good, aunt.

793
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,830
Not Sahiban's. Your sister's.

794
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,490
Even your sister doesn't
stir feelings for home.

795
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,440
You've become hard hearted, Mirza.

796
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:40,410
Even I don't know what
Sahiban has done to me.

797
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,620
She has snatched away
all you have.

798
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,520
After listening about you both...

799
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,990
she cursed Sahiban.

800
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:49,810
Why did she do that?

801
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,490
- Why didn't she curse me?
- She didn't.

802
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,800
She's called you home.
She's very ill.

803
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:00,260
She asked you to see her,
if you want. The last time.

804
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:03,540
Your lovely mare Neeli
is thinking of you.

805
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,720
Your mother cries day and night.

806
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,450
- Did you hear?
- I did.

807
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,430
But I can't go.

808
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:16,130
I might get a message from Sahiban.

809
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:21,100
Don't be naive.
Don't forget yourself.

810
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:23,210
If I could bring with me...

811
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:26,320
your mother's tears,
and your sister's pain...

812
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:29,666
you'd see for yourself,
how your thoughtlessness...

813
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,190
has caused so much suffering.

814
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,130
Everyone tries to make me understand...

815
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:36,010
but no one understands me.

816
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,840
It's easy to call pain by its name.

817
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,770
It's not easy to heal it.

818
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,560
Aunt, let me be.

819
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:08,330
The season of pleasure has come.
Moonlight has spread

820
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,400
Do come my moon (my beloved)

821
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,880
A pair of eyes are thirsting

822
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,560
Quench their thirst, my moon

823
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:05,360
My heart beats when I think of you

824
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:14,580
The heart flutters...

825
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,919
when a friend sings

826
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,160
The eyes are searching for you

827
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,110
Show a glimpse of yourself

828
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:04,439
When you aren't near
then nothing matters

829
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:11,220
It seems no one is longing for love

830
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,050
I don't understand this

831
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:23,800
Come and explain it to me, my moon

832
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:57,540
Your moon's here. Shhh. Quiet.

833
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,990
Come on. Close your eyes.

834
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:11,310
Come on everybody. Hide!

835
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,540
- Where's Sahiban?
- Sahiban?

836
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,070
- You go.
- Yes. Go.

837
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,060
You go on about Sahiban...

838
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,940
as if she was
the only girl in the village.

839
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:48,630
Go and look for her.
Unfaithful man.

840
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:53,170
Noora? Are you annoyed?
I didn't know...

841
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,400
there was place
in your heart for me.

842
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,090
Because of my size, one needs...

843
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:02,530
a very big heart.

844
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:07,360
Noora, do you love me?

845
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:10,700
Then you'll have to stand by me.

846
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,140
I want to know...

847
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,320
when and where Sahiban
meets Mirza on the quiet.

848
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:21,090
- You'll help me?
- Yes.

849
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:25,160
I'll help you,
but now you have to go.

850
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,230
People will gossip
if we're seen together.

851
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,656
Now go.

852
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,430
You're good, Noora, very good.

853
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:38,130
Where are you going?
Not there.

854
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,250
- Here.
- I forgot. I'm in love.

855
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,790
I'll go where you say.

856
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:46,686
- Yes. Go there.
- You'll help me, Noora?

857
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,690
Yes, yes. But now just go.

858
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,580
Something is fishy.

859
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:03,870
Let's go and see.

860
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,560
Leave my hand. Noora's coming.

861
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,930
Noora's joined our hands.
Why fear her?

862
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:15,410
I wouldn't hold your hands
only to leave them.

863
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:20,330
Sahiban, promise that our
hands will always remain united.

864
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,600
Promise you'll come every night.

865
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,900
Your silence means, yes.

866
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,930
Now the endless days will pass in...

867
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,180
the hope that my moon will come.

868
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:39,090
Sahiban, let's go. It's getting late.

869
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:42,910
Noora, you're the light of our world.

870
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:44,790
May God keep you happy.

871
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:48,430
Sahiban, come on.
The moon's about to fade away.

872
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:53,000
Noora, not one, but two moons
are going to fade away.

873
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:55,250
One in heaven...

874
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,520
one on earth.

875
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,650
One belongs to the world...

876
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,750
the other to Mirza.

877
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,560
Come on Sahiban.

878
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:17,290
Stupid me.
Why should I be afraid?

879
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:20,630
I'll put an end to these meetings.

880
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:27,730
Shamir, it's time to get Sahiban married.

881
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:30,600
We must arrange it with Bhuman.

882
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,590
Don't worry, mother.
I'll see to it today.

883
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:42,090
- You have a long life.
- Long life?

884
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:46,520
Shamir, it's my wish to see my life end.

885
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,510
- Your brain is as fat as you.
- Why?

886
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:53,520
Mother just mentioned you,
for Sahiban.

887
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:55,850
And you're fed up with life?

888
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,200
Mirza has gone. No fear.

889
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,800
Mirza's gone?

890
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,860
But Shamir, Mirza has
left home, not the village.

891
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:05,840
Not from Sahiban's heart.

892
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:10,340
When you all are asleep at night...

893
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,690
Sahiban meets him on the quiet.

894
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:17,866
How's it possible?
I kicked him out of the house.

895
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,680
I've seen it myself.

896
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,560
If it's so,
I'll beat Mirza to pieces.

897
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,210
You'll beat him to pieces?
Why?

898
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,000
Does he come to meet Sahiban?

899
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:31,640
So I have to kill Sahiban.

900
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,980
What's it to Mirza?
It's your sister getting killed.

901
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:39,576
What should I do?
How to take revenge?

902
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,790
I'll show you the way.

903
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,710
Listen. Lock Sahiban
at home for some days.

904
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:51,490
She won't meet him,
and love will be contained.

905
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:54,800
No fire, no smoke.

906
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:58,750
As time passes she'll forget him.

907
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,860
A disappointed Mirza
will leave the village.

908
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,400
- Then there can be a wedding.
- Okay.

909
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,730
- I'll do it.
- That's it.

910
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,610
Noora, Shamir's guarding the door.

911
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,800
- Now what?
- Now What?

912
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,080
And you claim to be in love?

913
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,090
When Soni wanted to meet Mahiwal...

914
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,890
she jumped into the raging river.

915
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:43,880
Can't you jump off the terrace?

916
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:45,530
Come on. Jump.

917
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:49,590
I'll try.

918
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,090
Come on. Hurry.

919
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:13,710
I'll see how she goes out today.

920
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:22,590
You've come, but where's my moon?

921
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,320
Your moon's here too, Mirza.

922
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:31,960
- Where's Noora?
- I'm here.

923
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,030
Sahiban, you're so late.

924
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:40,000
Didn't you consider
how I wait all day for you?

925
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,520
Your Sahiban has deceived
death to come here.

926
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:47,200
Brother was guarding the door.

927
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,930
I've jumped from the terrace
to come here.

928
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:52,020
You do so much for me.

929
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,560
Not for you.

930
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:57,030
For me.

931
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,770
Till I see your face...

932
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:01,930
I'm restless.

933
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,550
After seeing your face...

934
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:06,240
I'm still restless.

935
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,220
I'm in agony before meeting you...

936
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,440
I'm in agony after meeting you.

937
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,180
Is the other name of love, agony?

938
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,260
When two hearts meet for a moment...

939
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:23,530
the whole life's agony disappears.

940
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:26,750
I see you for a while every night...

941
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,670
and spend the day thinking of you.

942
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,140
Now even this is difficult...

943
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,280
for my heart says this
is our last meeting.

944
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,060
Don't say that, Sahiban.

945
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:51,460
- Sir.
- Me? Sir?

946
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,760
Who is it?

947
01:17:56,260 --> 01:18:00,450
- Oh, it's you?
- You, unfaithful.

948
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:03,450
My Noora. My life.

949
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:06,180
Light of my love.

950
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:10,066
Go on. Don't try
to catch me in your web.

951
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:12,640
Oh. Okay. I'll go then.

952
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:15,070
Annoyed?

953
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,200
And you swore you loved me.

954
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:21,430
Say it once more.

955
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,640
No one has ever called me, Sir.

956
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:27,060
Noora, say it once more.

957
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:28,930
Sir.

958
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:31,360
Live a thousand years.

959
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,850
But tell me.

960
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,830
Who are you waiting for?
At midnight?

961
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:40,530
Really! The one
for whom I'm miserable...

962
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,010
asks me this question.

963
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,030
What did I know...

964
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,780
that God would grant
me such a great boon.

965
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,810
I don't feel like going
where I was supposed to.

966
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,280
Where was Sir going?

967
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:07,510
You said Sir, again?

968
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,060
Sir was going
in search of Sahiban.

969
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:13,070
You mentioned Sahiban again?

970
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,016
I've told you not
to mention her in front of me.

971
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,740
- I won't.
- If Sahiban is the sun, I'm the moon.

972
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,490
Oh, my moon.

973
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:25,270
Okay. See you later. Here.

974
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:28,060
Where are you going,
after wounding my heart, Sir?

975
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:31,520
Sir? Again? When you say...

976
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:35,050
Sir, my heart beats faster.

977
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,590
Today the love story
must be completed.

978
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:41,150
Our eyes will meet...

979
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:44,660
Every one sees with eyes.
The story is completed when...

980
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:48,130
one sees one's beloved
even with closed eyes.

981
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,320
- Really?
- If it's true love, close your eyes and find out...

982
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:56,260
whether you see me all around.

983
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,320
Closed eyes? Done.

984
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:04,210
I can't see anything. Noora?

985
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:07,600
I really can't see a thing. Noora?

986
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:13,260
Hurry, let's go. Bhuman's here.

987
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:15,960
- No Mirza.
- Come on.

988
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,580
No, no. From here.

989
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,670
So, that's what it is!

990
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:24,160
Made a fool of me with her Sirs!

991
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,100
Shamir said he'd guard the entrance.

992
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:31,970
Must have gone off to sleep.

993
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:34,580
Well. I'll see to you three.

994
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,750
It's late.
I've to cut grass for fodder.

995
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,450
Didn't sleep all night.

996
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:59,626
- Sure, you were guarding all night.
- And how!

997
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:02,600
- Even air couldn't pass.
- Not air, perhaps...

998
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:04,970
but Sahiban did.

999
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,430
That's a lie.

1000
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:09,430
I saw it myself.

1001
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,600
Impossible. I'd blocked
the door all night.

1002
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:14,540
Yes, yes. All night..

1003
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,350
You may have done that...

1004
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,210
but she went out anyhow.

1005
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,670
- Did she?
- Yes.

1006
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:23,630
This girl has ruined our reputation.

1007
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:26,700
Not she. Mirza. But brother...

1008
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,630
if you were so concerned...

1009
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:32,210
you'd have destroyed
Mirza by now.

1010
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:49,030
Bhaiya, where are you
going with the axe?

1011
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,540
To cut Mirza to pieces.

1012
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,710
He has disgraced our family.

1013
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:57,250
Before Mirza,
cut your sister to pieces.

1014
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:01,930
If I could do that,
I'd have done it by now.

1015
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,160
Shamir, wait.

1016
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:14,620
It's not your place
to take revenge while I'm alive.

1017
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,210
Mirza has disgraced me.

1018
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:18,910
I'll be the one to take revenge.

1019
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,350
Okay. Then take this.

1020
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:25,310
This axe will only injure him...

1021
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,820
not his love.

1022
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,600
I know what to do.

1023
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,800
I knew you'd come
to wipe my tears away.

1024
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:46,750
I'm in no position to do that.
I myself am crying.

1025
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,390
I've come
to ask you for something.

1026
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,900
My family's respect...

1027
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:55,420
Sahiban's life,
and an old man's dignity...

1028
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:58,040
you've taken all this away.

1029
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,350
Uncle, what are you saying?

1030
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,050
I thought you sympathized with me.

1031
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,080
I thought, the world
might go against me...

1032
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:09,780
but you'd still love me.

1033
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:13,540
I knew you'd come to...

1034
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,830
give me my life, my happiness.

1035
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,010
I didn't come for that.

1036
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,510
I came to ask for Sahiban's
life and happiness.

1037
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:25,820
Her life and happiness
lies in our meeting.

1038
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:28,950
No. Her life and happiness...

1039
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,810
- lies in parting from you.
- Uncle...

1040
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,890
if that happens,
she'll die anyway.

1041
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:39,430
If you don't listen,
she'll have to kill herself.

1042
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:41,700
Suicide?

1043
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:45,150
Yes. Her reputation is ruined
in the village.

1044
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:48,830
Our life has become difficult here.

1045
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:52,550
You deny ruining her?

1046
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:56,150
Three lives
have been pained at home.

1047
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,400
Her mother's not eating or drinking.

1048
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:03,970
Her brother's sleep
and rest have gone.

1049
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:08,110
Her old father is unable
to face the village.

1050
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:12,750
How long will she see this,
and bear it?

1051
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:17,090
The day you first talked
of love with her...

1052
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,020
you took away her happiness
and ruined her life.

1053
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:28,070
Son, I brought you
like a light to our home.

1054
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:33,630
I didn't realize then
it would set fire to our home.

1055
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:39,470
Reflect.
Try to understand the situation.

1056
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:42,710
I could...

1057
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:44,980
but love won't.

1058
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:46,990
Love?

1059
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:48,780
You call it love?

1060
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:52,220
Ruining the home
of the one you love?

1061
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:54,340
Taking her life?

1062
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:58,030
If you loved her,
you wouldn't do this.

1063
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:02,980
You can still save Sahiban.

1064
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,490
- How?
- Go away from here.

1065
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:08,570
Uncle, it's impossible.

1066
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:13,310
How's it possible?

1067
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,990
I can't live without her.

1068
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:20,070
How can one slay oneself?

1069
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,760
With my own hands,
break my heart?

1070
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:26,760
Uncle, don't be so cruel.

1071
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:28,870
Don't force me to leave.

1072
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:33,430
Chaudhary has never begged
a favor from anyone.

1073
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:35,700
Today, I beg of you.

1074
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:39,690
A sorrowful father has come
to your door to beg.

1075
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,550
Don't turn me out empty handed.

1076
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:45,810
If you want Sahiban
and her family to live...

1077
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,650
go away from here.

1078
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:50,620
For my sake. If not,
then for God's sake.

1079
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,050
If not for God, then for
the sake of Sahiban, go.

1080
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,410
You've forced me,
for the sake of Sahiban.

1081
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:06,330
I'll go.

1082
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:15,600
- God be with you.
- God be with you.

1083
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:00,920
No use going there anymore.

1084
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,660
Don't say that.

1085
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:07,350
Mother's become my enemy.

1086
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:10,400
Brother has snatched
away my happiness.

1087
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,360
I didn't care.

1088
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:15,100
But father, you cannot be cruel.

1089
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,540
You don't have a heart of stone.

1090
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,710
You know I've not committed any sin.

1091
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:23,590
Let me go father.

1092
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,200
He must be waiting for me.

1093
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:28,090
Daughter, there's
no one waiting there today.

1094
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:32,410
He must be waiting impatiently.

1095
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:35,740
Let me go, father.

1096
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,800
He'll tire of waiting for me.

1097
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:41,290
I've seen his impatience
while waiting for me.

1098
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:45,680
The moon is high.
Let me go, father.

1099
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:47,730
I know...

1100
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:51,210
you won't be able to bear
what I'm going to say.

1101
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,960
Your heart will break...

1102
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:56,330
but it's the truth..

1103
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:58,870
The person you're going to meet...

1104
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:00,630
isn't here anymore.

1105
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:02,920
Mirza has left the village.

1106
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:06,350
Don't say that.
It's impossible.

1107
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,300
Mirza cannot leave...

1108
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,630
without meeting me.

1109
01:28:15,210 --> 01:28:16,610
You're lying.

1110
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:20,720
You don't want me to meet Mirza.

1111
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,960
This cannot happen.
The world can change...

1112
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:27,300
Mother can abandon her daughter...

1113
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,470
brother can deceive his sister...

1114
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:32,290
father can take away her happiness...

1115
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:35,830
but Mirza won't do such a thing.

1116
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,840
Mirza will never leave me, father.

1117
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:06,460
Where are you?

1118
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,660
Have you really gone?

1119
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:21,500
May you prosper together.

1120
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:25,190
Tell me where Mirza has gone?

1121
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:31,430
How would you know?

1122
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:35,840
You too are suffering from
the pangs of separation.

1123
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:42,150
Mirza, I have
no sympathizer now.

1124
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:46,590
No companion. No one
to show me the way.

1125
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,760
You tell me why you have left.

1126
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,970
What did I do?

1127
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,200
You know...

1128
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:03,170
for you I got a bad name
in every street.

1129
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:04,670
Mocked in every home.

1130
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:10,240
Mother, father, brother have
become my enemy.

1131
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:14,020
You were the only support.

1132
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:17,800
And now you've gone.

1133
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:22,080
Mirza, where are your promises?

1134
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,330
And all that you said?
Tell me.

1135
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:34,850
Is this your love?

1136
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:49,850
Was this your love?

1137
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:02,420
I was waiting

1138
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:34,290
If you wanted to go away...

1139
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:44,350
why did you fall in love?

1140
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:53,460
That we'd never part...

1141
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:04,420
I was confident about

1142
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:48,090
Why have you come to meet...

1143
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:58,250
bringing the pieces of your heart?

1144
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,270
The heart, which is soaked
in blood today...

1145
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:18,010
was full of love for someone

1146
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:54,870
You're going to get married.

1147
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:57,820
You'll forget us
in your husband's house.

1148
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:01,670
Sister, I'm not happy about anything.

1149
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:05,180
I think of my brother all the time.

1150
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,690
Where's the poor man?

1151
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:09,190
How's he faring?

1152
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:12,030
Your jewelry's here.

1153
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:17,600
You brother would have
been so happy today.

1154
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:21,230
Take these away.

1155
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,570
Bring my brother if
you want me to be happy.

1156
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:29,140
God, I'll be so grateful...

1157
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,710
if I can meet him once.

1158
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:36,090
Neeli, what happened to you?

1159
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:42,050
Who are you?

1160
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:58,950
- Son! My son.
- Brother.

1161
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:01,990
- Who?
- Chatti

1162
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:05,850
It'll take time
to recognize others.

1163
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,360
What others?

1164
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:09,550
- Chatti, your sister.
- Brother!

1165
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,040
What a state you're in.

1166
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:20,990
Chaudhary said he'll educate you.

1167
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:23,090
And make him a human.

1168
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:25,210
What did he do?

1169
01:35:26,490 --> 01:35:29,120
What a great favor
he has done me.

1170
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:32,600
My son was like a lion.

1171
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:36,430
His daughter snatched all away.

1172
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:38,860
Don't go anywhere, my son.

1173
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,640
I don't want to educate you.

1174
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,690
I don't want to civilize you.

1175
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,130
I may not go anywhere.

1176
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:49,130
But I've promised her...

1177
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:51,510
when she calls...

1178
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,310
I'll go to her.

1179
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:57,710
Who? That blood sucking witch?

1180
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,190
I won't let you go anywhere now.

1181
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:02,260
I won't let you step out.

1182
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:04,590
If a messenger comes from her...

1183
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,490
I'll break his bones.

1184
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,160
Sahiban, do you see?

1185
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:11,640
They are my sympathizers...

1186
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,500
and yet they want us parted.

1187
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:16,340
Crazy boy.

1188
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:21,360
I don't need these clothes.

1189
01:36:21,870 --> 01:36:24,260
What you consider
a wedding is a funeral for me.

1190
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,570
Bring me a shroud, mother.

1191
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:32,280
What a wet blanket.
Girl, control your tongue.

1192
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,740
Crying on such a happy day.

1193
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,720
What are you mourning?
Think, and understand.

1194
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:39,950
Noora, make her understand.

1195
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:43,050
I'll talk to her.

1196
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,160
Hey, but no hanky-panky.

1197
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:49,020
I'll sort out everything.
You go amma.

1198
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:55,050
What are you saying?

1199
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,480
Making a mockery of love?

1200
01:36:57,930 --> 01:36:59,680
Not yet satisfied
with the disgrace?

1201
01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:04,680
What to do? You know...

1202
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:07,990
Mirza's name is etched on all
the broken pieces of my heart.

1203
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:12,560
He's my bridegroom, my companion.

1204
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:18,430
If I've ever thought of another man,
let a lightning bolt strike me.

1205
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:22,470
I know everything.
That's why I say...

1206
01:37:22,650 --> 01:37:25,610
wear your bridal clothes happily...

1207
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:29,410
and smile. A bride isn't sad
on her wedding day.

1208
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:33,920
Don't sprinkle salt on
my wounds like others.

1209
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:37,960
Like others, I want
to see you as a bride.

1210
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:41,750
But while they see
Bhuman as your groom...

1211
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:44,300
I see Mirza.

1212
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:49,210
May you always be happy.

1213
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:51,920
But how's it possible?

1214
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:54,900
How? That's what
I'm wondering too.

1215
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:58,350
I can't see a way yet.

1216
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:04,420
You once said,
love finds its own way.

1217
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:07,160
Yes, there's only one way.

1218
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:10,210
I'm thinking about going to Mirza.

1219
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,730
Noora, then why don't you?

1220
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:17,710
What a lazy response.
It doesn't match my quickness.

1221
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:21,370
Should I just go? No petition.

1222
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:24,330
No pleading. No bribery.

1223
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:26,950
It's a matter of life and death.

1224
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,040
And you're joking?

1225
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:33,400
I fall at your feet,
and beg you to...

1226
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:35,320
go, tell Mirza.

1227
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,870
If he doesn't come now,
time will run out.

1228
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:42,570
If you want our happiness,
then come like the wind.

1229
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:47,680
Go Noora, before celebration
turns to mourning here.

1230
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,490
Bring the light of my happiness.

1231
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:12,730
Come and listen
to the story of our parting

1232
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:26,060
What the heart bears...

1233
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,820
I'll tell you with my eyes

1234
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:54,710
Give him my message that...

1235
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:10,780
like the world,
he mustn't forget about me.

1236
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:41,920
The only thing my tear-filled eyes
request of him now...

1237
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:58,260
either he should send death
or come himself

1238
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:29,220
If he asks how I am, tell him...

1239
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:45,670
I'm alive, but praying for death

1240
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,270
Open the door, Mirza.

1241
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:46,860
- Who are you?
- I'm Noora.

1242
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:50,050
- I've come to meet Mirza.
- Whoever you may be...

1243
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:51,880
Mirza won't meet anyone.

1244
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:56,040
I have an important
message from Sahiban.

1245
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:59,850
From Sahiban? Then you
must meet him. Come.

1246
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:04,230
Mirza mentioned you
as being very nice.

1247
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:07,130
And Sahiban?
He thinks of her all the time.

1248
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,410
He's greatly indebted to you all.

1249
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,580
- Where is he?
- I'll take you to him.

1250
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:18,360
He sits in this small, dark room,
thinking of her.

1251
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:20,230
- Here?
- Yes. Come on.

1252
01:43:23,410 --> 01:43:25,840
Open the door.

1253
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:27,780
For God's sake open the door.

1254
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:30,150
It's a question
of Sahiban's life and death.

1255
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:32,430
Sahiban's life and death? Ha.

1256
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:35,490
What about poor Mirza?

1257
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:38,650
Sending messages?
Sahiban must be thinking...

1258
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,920
some of Mirza's bones
must be intact.

1259
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,730
Why spare them?
Scream all you like in there.

1260
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:51,900
Noora's voice? Here?

1261
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,860
I'm here in this small room.

1262
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:59,100
- When did you come?
- Forget the greetings.

1263
01:43:59,430 --> 01:44:02,210
First let me out.
I'm suffocating.

1264
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:05,860
Not my love affair, nor my message,
but I'm the one imprisoned.

1265
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:08,070
- Message.
- I won't tell you anything...

1266
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:11,550
First get me out
of this suffocating place.

1267
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:20,430
Your sister imprisoned me here.

1268
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:23,230
She should have been a constable.

1269
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:26,570
Mirza, whose wedding preparations?

1270
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:28,416
My sister's.

1271
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:30,080
Baraat's (groom's party) about to arrive.

1272
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:33,230
Leave this. How's Sahiban?

1273
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:35,660
There too a baraat will arrive.

1274
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,820
A happy one here.
A mournful one there.

1275
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:40,750
What do you mean?
Is Sahiban happy?

1276
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:43,910
Till now, yes. But if you...

1277
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:47,490
don't go there like the wind,
she won't be.

1278
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,860
Bhuman is bringing his baraat.

1279
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:53,900
The one she's waiting for
is miles away.

1280
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,210
She's sent a message.

1281
01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:59,440
If you don't come now,
it's of no use later.

1282
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:03,510
I will go.

1283
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:06,600
We are married spiritually.

1284
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,330
Our spirits can't be parted.

1285
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:13,260
While I'm alive, no one
dare even look at her.

1286
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,230
Noora, you go.

1287
01:45:15,930 --> 01:45:18,590
Tell Sahiban not to be sad...

1288
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:21,520
to dry her tears. I'm coming.

1289
01:45:21,970 --> 01:45:24,140
I will come. You go Noora.

1290
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:42,396
Be happy Sahiban.

1291
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:43,820
Mirza will come.

1292
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:54,870
Who opened the door?
Where's the messenger?

1293
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,500
Brother, where are you going?

1294
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:04,580
I told you I would get a message.

1295
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,200
It was cruel to imprison Noora.

1296
01:46:07,610 --> 01:46:09,540
It's a question
of Sahiban's life and death.

1297
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:11,670
If Noora hadn't met me today...

1298
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:14,690
it would have been disastrous.
Mirza and Sahiban's love...

1299
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,620
would have shed tears forever.

1300
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:21,070
- I'm going to meet Sahiban.
- Is that all you see?

1301
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,650
It's your sister's wedding.
The baraat is about to come.

1302
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:28,200
The ceremony is soon to take place,
and you're going out.

1303
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:30,510
Without you,
how'll your sister marry?

1304
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,990
Who'll perform the rites?
Who'll welcome the baraat?

1305
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:36,100
Who'll carry me to the palanquin?

1306
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,750
Here there's happiness...

1307
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:44,300
and there it's the ruin
of two people.

1308
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:47,850
Here it's a day of rejoicing;
there, for mourning.

1309
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:51,930
Mirza is a sister's brother;
a bride's groom.

1310
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:55,540
Sister can wait;
the bride cannot.

1311
01:46:57,150 --> 01:47:01,280
I promise. I'll go like the wind,
and return like the storm.

1312
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:04,350
I'll perform all the rites;
carry you to the palanquin.

1313
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:07,080
My good sister, let me go.
Don't stop me.

1314
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:12,360
You can't go. There can't be
a wedding without you.

1315
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:17,340
This wedding can be delayed.
That won't be.

1316
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:20,490
If I'm delayed, it will be disastrous.

1317
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:26,030
The mehndi on my hands
pleads with you to stay.

1318
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:29,040
You have henna on your hands...

1319
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,750
while someone's wishes
are being killed.

1320
01:47:34,130 --> 01:47:36,410
You can't see what I see.

1321
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:41,260
Sahiban is waiting
with tears in her eyes.

1322
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:43,910
If her patience runs out..

1323
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:47,350
And I'm delayed, Sahiban won't be...

1324
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:49,100
found alive.

1325
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:51,460
Let me go.

1326
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:56,350
I promise I'll come back.

1327
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:05,800
Neeli, bring my brother back.

1328
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:09,600
Run hard.
My brother is going into danger.

1329
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:12,950
If anything happens to him,
I'll hold you responsible.

1330
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:16,360
Nothing will happen to your brother.

1331
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:18,670
As long as I have
my bow and arrow...

1332
01:48:19,210 --> 01:48:21,110
even death won't dare to come.

1333
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,530
Okay mother, Chatti.

1334
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:25,350
Sahiban is calling me.

1335
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:27,600
You're leaving your sister?

1336
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,480
It isn't right, brother.

1337
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:40,530
There in front, in the alley,
is my house

1338
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:46,420
Don't forget my address

1339
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:31,130
The moon will shine
on the hearts

1340
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:49,200
Taking your name, I sigh deeply

1341
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:59,270
A wounded heart
with fear of the world

1342
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:48,300
Noora, what'll I do
if he doesn't come?

1343
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:51,490
Get me some poison.

1344
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:54,230
If waiting is fruitless...

1345
01:50:55,130 --> 01:50:57,260
I'll end my life immediately.

1346
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,800
Don't say that. He'll come.

1347
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:03,310
Wipe your tears away.
It's your wedding today.

1348
01:51:09,150 --> 01:51:11,330
I'm feeling nervous.

1349
01:51:12,150 --> 01:51:13,950
Bring her quickly.

1350
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:17,030
- Why are you so impatient?
- Because of the situation.

1351
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:21,610
Where are you taking me?

1352
01:51:22,730 --> 01:51:24,130
He won't come.

1353
01:51:24,330 --> 01:51:26,610
No Sahiban. He promised.

1354
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:28,330
He'll come.

1355
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:35,270
I told you he'd come.

1356
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:48,670
Take out the horses.
Follow them.

1357
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,200
The baraat is here,
but Mirza isn't.

1358
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:12,470
He'll come.
He promised me.

1359
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:15,310
He'll carry me to my palanquin.

1360
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:17,260
He owes me.

1361
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:25,690
Neeli, you've promised
someone, remember?

1362
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:27,580
Go faster, Neeli.

1363
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:37,076
There's nothing here.

1364
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:38,630
Shamir took all the horses?

1365
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:41,980
What to do now?

1366
01:52:42,050 --> 01:52:44,540
- Sir?
- Go. Unfaithful.

1367
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:46,600
I'm going after Sahiban.

1368
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:50,550
But how to go?
There's no mount.

1369
01:52:51,090 --> 01:52:55,100
Sir, I've brought
an excellent mount for you.

1370
01:53:00,070 --> 01:53:03,320
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

1371
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:04,940
You go home now.

1372
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:20,080
- Where are you taking me mother?
- Don't be crazy.

1373
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:24,160
- Your palanquin has come.
- But brother hasn't.

1374
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:25,940
I won't go.

1375
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:30,610
Hold the reins

1376
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:49,010
Come on, walk on.

1377
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,960
Don't you know Mirza has
run away with my bride?

1378
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,860
- Sahiba, let go.
- No!

1379
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:33,540
What happened, Mirza?

1380
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:35,360
Nothing, Sahiban. Come on.

1381
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:39,140
Water! Water!

1382
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:56,650
He promised.
He will come.

1383
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:01,800
Don't worry Sahiban.
Death won't come...

1384
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:06,110
because I promised
my sister I'll come.

1385
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:11,720
There he is, with his bow and arrow,
riding Neeli swiftly...

1386
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:13,600
tearing through his way.

1387
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:15,830
Thinking of his sister...

1388
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:17,380
he's riding here like a storm.

1389
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:25,690
Where's my brother?
You promised to bring him back.

1390
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,520
Where's the promise
about the bow and arrow?

1391
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:34,520
The celebration
has turned to mourning.

1392
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,890
The sehra flowers have become tears.

1393
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:39,690
The palanquin has become the pyre.

1394
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:44,670
Who's taken your life?

1395
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:46,790
Who broke your bow?

1396
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:51,060
Why did you break my bow?

1397
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:55,170
I promised my sister...

1398
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:57,710
I'd carry her to the palanquin.

1399
01:55:58,370 --> 01:55:59,770
Forgive me, Mirza.

1400
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:04,750
This is our last meeting.

1401
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:07,830
The arrow is leaving the bow, Sahiban.

1402
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:09,580
Don't say that, Mirza.

1403
01:56:10,010 --> 01:56:13,690
As it is my heart is tearing.

1404
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,970
I won't be able
to stay alive without you.

1405
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:21,570
Remember your promise...

1406
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:24,660
of spending our lives together.

1407
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:28,600
Where are you going,
leaving me all alone?

1408
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:32,210
Sahiban, may death come to you.
May your youth be ruined...

1409
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:34,400
your happiness burn away.

1410
01:56:34,830 --> 01:56:36,690
May you struggle in life.

1411
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:39,340
May you have no support.

1412
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:42,990
May you too die in agony,
like my brother.

1413
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:50,860
Mirza where are you going?
You said we'd always be together.

1414
01:56:54,830 --> 01:56:56,340
I've lost everything.

1415
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:59,770
There's no support without you.

1416
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:04,090
Come back Mirza.

1417
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:06,820
Don't leave me.

1418
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:11,890
Sahiban, I'm leaving.

1419
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:28,970
I cannot leave you.
I'm coming with you, Mirza.
