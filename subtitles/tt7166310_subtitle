00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,280
Chandra?

5
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,400
Chandra?

6
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,610
What's wrong?

7
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,900
I want to go home.

8
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,490
Chandra, haven't I told
you that Shivraj sir, is my senior?

9
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,070
He loves me like a sister.

10
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,240
Everything will be ok.
Trust me.

11
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,820
It won't be ok.

12
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,900
It can never be.

13
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,450
I am sure of it.

14
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,650
Chandra Chatterjee, sir...

15
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,360
On the 15th of August, 2004,
her husband Dhananjoy Chatterjee...

16
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,900
...was hanged.

17
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,700
Hmm.

18
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,650
First, I would like to know...

19
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,700
...why are you so
interested in this case?

20
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,150
My friend Rumni...

21
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,700
...is associated with an NGO.

22
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,900
These vegetables are
grown in the village.

23
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,490
Ok...

24
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,950
Those pictures have been
drawn by kids from this village.

25
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,610
What about these?

26
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,700
I was attending a function
at Aangan Bari when...

27
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,650
Chandra, sit properly.

28
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
He didn't do anything.

29
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,820
Why did they take him away?

30
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,650
Chandra, calm down...

31
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,150
She has a history. Will tell you later.
Come on...

32
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,030
Come along...

34
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,950
The village women ready the Cassia leaves
and put them in packets...

35
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,320
And they are our little...

36
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,280
Hey! What are you studying?
Poetry?

37
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,450
Very good...

38
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,990
She has such strange eyes.

39
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,240
She's a lot better now.

40
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,700
The court verdict hailed it as
one of the rarest cases of murder.

41
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,780
But she believes that
her husband is innocent.

42
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,110
Very natural.

43
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,030
The family of every
convict feels the same.

44
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,490
Goddess Kali...

45
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,700
Goddess Biswa Lakshmi...

46
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,490
Great Goddess Manasa...

47
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,740
Bring him back.

48
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,990
I will perform a puja in your name.
Please bring him back.

49
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,780
I will perform a puja in your name.
Please bring him back...

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,530
Uh...

52
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,650
Bring him back...

53
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,820
I want to talk to her.

54
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,900
Chandra?

55
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,700
Chandra?

56
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,450
Please eat.

57
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,030
I contacted you after speaking with her and
looking through the case details.

58
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,900
The loochi's (flatbread) are almost ready.

59
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,360
And then?

60
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,990
What you are about to hear is in accordance
with court details and statements of the prosecution.

61
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,320
Why didn't you come home?

62
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,240
The police are looking for me.

63
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,700
That's why I've been
hiding out at Mona's.

64
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,280
Why are the police looking for you?

65
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,990
They were looking for him because on
the previous evening, the 5th of March...

66
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,450
...a most tragic incident took place
at Sunanda apartments in Kolkata.

67
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,570
Yes.

68
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,570
5th March, 1990

69
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,200
Gullu, how are you?
- I'm ok.

70
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,530
Bye!
- Bye.

71
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,570
How are you?
- I'm ok.

72
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,780
How were your exams?
- Pretty good.

73
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,150
There you go...

74
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,780
What took you so long?

75
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,150
Jam.

76
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,490
5:20PM

77
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,650
Namaste Bhabiji (Madam).
- Hmm.

78
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,950
I really need some tea...

79
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,240
'The water runs below the ship,
The water runs...'

80
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,150

81
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,570

82
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,900
Janardhan...
- Hmm?

83
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,860
I am going up to Mr.Parekh's flat.
- Hmm.

84
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,110
Need to call the agency.

85
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,820
'The water runs below the ship,
The water runs...'

86
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,030
What news?
- It's all good.

87
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,360
Sure?
- Yes...

88
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,200
(Guard is humming a Hindi tune)

89
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,900
Janak!
- Yes, sir.

90
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,860
Has Dhananjoy come?

91
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,450
He just went up to Mr.Parekh's flat.

92
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,030
What?

93
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
But I have already fired him!

94
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,150
Ajay Thapa has been hired in his place.

95
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,030
Call him.

96
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,610
Dhananjoy?

97
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,570
I'm coming...

98
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,900
Were you looking for me Pati Da?

99
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,110
Haven't you received
your transfer letter?

100
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,740
I had duty here till 2pm.

101
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,530
Now I have certain
other engagements,

102
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,070
after which I'll be off
to Mahesh Apartments.

103
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,070
Ok, ok...

104
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,490
It's nearly 6, don't make it late-
- I'll be back on time.

105
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,450
Get going!

106
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,490
Shree Laxmi Narayan Mandir Society

107
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,900
5:50 PM

108
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,570
Ram, Ram (Indian greeting), ma'am.

109
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,110
While you were at the mandir...

110
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,900
...Dhananjoy had been to your flat.

111
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,780
Why?

112
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,030
Said that he needed
to make a phone call.

113
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,360
Ma'am I am supposed to get some
money from you, so it would be-

114
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,110
I'll give it to you.

115
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,490
Ok.

116
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,070
Hema?

117
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,780
Hema open the door!

118
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,740
Hema!

119
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,900
Hema open the door!

120
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,200
What are you doing?

121
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,110
What's wrong?

122
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,740
She isn't opening the door!

123
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,110
Hema!
- Hema?

124
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,900
Hema!
- Hema!

125
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,360
Please help!

126
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,150
She isn't opening the door.

127
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,240
Hema!

128
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,610
She must be sleeping.
- Hema!

129
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,820
What's happened?

130
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,030
Hema!
- Open the door!

131
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,070
She must be sleeping...

132
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,150
Someone must have killed her!

133
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,860
No, no, no...
- Break the door!

134
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,400
Break the door!
Hema!

135
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,860
Hema!

136
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,530
Hema open the door!

137
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,860
Break the door!

138
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,360
Break it!

139
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,490
Ma'am please move out of the way.

140
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,900
Oh God! She hasn't even
switched on the lights!

141
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,110
Hema!

142
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,070
Huh!
- Hema-

143
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,780
Oh God!
- Oh my God!

144
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,280
How could this have happened?

145
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,950
Hema!

146
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,860
Hema...

147
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,650
Dhananjoy...

148
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,860
Where did Dhananjoy go?

149
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,490
Dhananjoy!

150
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,360
Where is Dhananjoy?

151
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,530
How did this happen?
- Dhananjoy!

152
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,240
Don't just stand here!
Call an ambulance, doctors, policemen!...

153
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,400
Let's go...

154
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,240
Hema...

155
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,900
Someone get the lift!

156
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,450
Press the button for the lift!...

157
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,280
Doctor?

158
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,530
Please come this way...

159
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,360
Ma'am?

160
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,900
Sorry Bhabiji...

161
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,280
We have to inform the police.
- Police?

162
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,450
No...

163
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,820
Ma!
- Hema...

164
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,700
My little princess Hemu
has left me!

165
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,030
Take her upstairs.
Where is your father?

166
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,400
Papa, has gone to the medical store.

167
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,490
He didn't know...

168
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,780
How did this happen?

169
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,320
That dog had gone up right before me!

170
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,240
Dhananjoy?
- Yes...

171
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,570
He murdered my daughter!

172
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,650
This is a disaster!

173
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,610
How could this have happened?

174
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,030
If you break down like this...
- My daughter has been butchered!

175
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,200
He used to harass her.

176
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,150
I had warned you...

177
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,740
But he didn't listen...

178
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,780
I had gone to the temple
and my daughter was...

179
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,280
Where is Dhananjoy?
Call the bugger!

180
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,400
I need to show this to the police.

181
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,700
I found this chain next to the swing.

182
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,400
And this button too.

183
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,490
Do you recognize it?

184
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,700
No.

185
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,990
I had seen this chain
around Hari's neck.

186
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,070
Who is Hari?
- I am, sir.

187
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,070
Is this yours?

188
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,200
Dhananjoy had borrowed
it a month back.

189
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,400
On which date?

190
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,530
I don't remember the date.

191
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,740
What's your address?

192
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,320
I work at Karuna madam's office.

193
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,280
I've been living there for
the past 10-12 years.

194
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,780
It doesn't look like
much has been taken.

195
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,780
What time did you
return home?

196
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,990
At 5:50PM

197
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,360
5:50PM.

198
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,490
They are friends with
Prashit Mukherjee aren't they?

199
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,450
Yes, the DCDD.

200
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,570
Sir, could you tell us something about
the events that occured?

201
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,900
We heard there has been a murder?
- Sir, please...

202
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,110
Move aside...
- Please tell us who has died...?

203
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,320
Sir, please...
- Let me get in first!

204
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,610
Sir, please tell us
what has happened?

205
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,070
God...

206
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,610
Hmm!
- Sir...

207
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,240
I saw her leave for school in the morning.
- Me too...

208
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,200
Hmm.

209
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,950
Sunil, I can see it all clearly...

210
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,570
Yes sir, you are famous for your intuition.

211
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,990
It's that guard, Dhananjoy.
Just you see.

212
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,360
Yes, sir.

213
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,150
What is this?

214
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,650
This is the generator room.

215
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,650
Dhananjoy lives here, sir.
- Huh?

216
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,900
What had I told you, Sunil?
- Yes, sir?

217
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,650
He lives here but
he isn't here now.

218
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,700
Yes, sir.
- Which means he has fled.

219
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,200
Right, sir.

220
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,990
Let's go!
- Yes, sir. This way...

221
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,700
Sir...

222
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,860
At around 9:15PM,
the girls father, Nishant Parekh...

223
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,820
...called Bhowanipore Station to report that
his daughter had been murdered.

224
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,450
And then?

225
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,990
Then we came and
investigated the matter.

226
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,860
Observations?

227
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,240
It seems to be a rape case.

228
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,860
Hmm.

229
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,450
We found visible injuries
to the face and neck.

230
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,610
We also found a button
and a chain necklace.

231
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,650
Any other injuries?

232
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,950
The nose is broken, and
so is the hyoid bone in the neck.

233
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,070
Looks like she had been strangled.

234
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,820
So the mother was the
first to discover the body?

235
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,240
Yes, sir.

236
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,820
We have recorded her statement.

237
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,570
Hmm.

238
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,700
She suspects a security guard
by the name of Dhananjoy.

239
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,650
Madam had left at 5:20PM

240
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,450
The man visited
the flat after that.

241
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,780
When did madam return?

242
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,110
5:50PM, sir.

243
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,400
A few people remember seeing
Dhananjoy leave the building at 5:45PM

244
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,400
Is that so?

245
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,860
Yes, sir.

246
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,320
He broke her hands and legs.

247
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,740
At around 5:50PM Hema Parekh's mother...

248
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,780
...returned home after attending the aarti
at the Laxmi Narayan Temple

249
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,150
And at around 5:45PM...

250
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,450
...quite a few people
from the building saw...

251
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,320
...Dhananjoy Chatterjee,
a security guard at the building...

252
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,700
...leaving this house.

253
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,900
According to the
mother's statement...

254
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,860
...the girl was murdered and raped.

255
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,110
Sir, forensic?

256
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
When is the forensic report-
- It will arrive.

257
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:37,740
The family suspect the
security guard, Dhananjoy Chatterjee.

258
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,610
We haven't found him yet.

259
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,950
But we are searching.

260
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,450
Today's top stories...

261
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:51,400
The Hema Parekh murder case has been handed over
to the Lal Bazar Detective Department.

262
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,900
The case is being headed by the new
investigating officer Sunil Basu Mullick.

263
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,360
The prime suspect Dhananjoy is said to be
on the run, while the police are on the hunt.

264
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,450
Sunil, when I have a hunch...

265
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,280
Yes, sir?

266
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,700
...it is never wrong.

267
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,570
Right, sir.

268
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,110
Dhananjoy 100%
- Yes.

269
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,280
When his intuition fails,
he cries like a baby.

270
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,200
Don't talk rubbish!

271
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,360
Rubbish?

272
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,740
Don't you get depressed when
your intuition fails you?

273
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,490
Sujit Da it's not that
easy to beat sir.

274
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,570
Investigation is in his blood-

275
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,110
Just shut it! A blind man
can see that it's Dhananjoy!

276
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,150
I will prove it in a few days.

277
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,700
Come on...
- Come on!

278
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,900
Where is he? Get him out!
- Get him out!...

279
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,150
Bring that bugger out!
- Come out you scumbag!...

280
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,820
Please don't hit him.
He's not Dhananjoy.

281
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,530
He is his younger brother.

282
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,240
Dhananjoy. Get him out here.
I'm warning you...

283
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,900
Or else we will do to you all,
what Dhananjoy did to that girl.

284
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,570
Hey! Talk to me.

285
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,320
Talk to me.
- Listen up you swine-

286
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,900
Your dad's a swine!

287
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,820
Old sod, aren't you ashamed?

288
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,400
How could you give birth
to such a degenerate creature?

289
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,610
I'll throttle you!
- No, no!

290
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,820
Trying to threaten me?

291
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,990
Trying to be tough?
- Yes!

292
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,530
While your son is out raping women!

293
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,450
I'll kill you!...
- Please don't hurt him!...

294
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,360
Let him go, sir!...

295
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,030
Here you go!

296
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,240
What has he done?...

297
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,650
You'd better get
Dhananjoy out of hiding.

298
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,610
Or else we will be back!

299
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,860
Come back if you dare...

300
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,740
Dhananjoy was untraceable
for about 2 months.

301
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
He had escaped to Rourkela,
and was discreetly working there.

302
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,360
He thought he would return
once things had cooled down.

303
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,820
I think...

304
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,950
...it was the month of May.

305
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,700
Chandra? Wasn't it
the month of May?

306
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,360
I want to go home.

307
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,070
Chandra, you know why we
have come here, don't you?

308
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,820
Don't you?

309
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,820
It's of no use.

310
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,070
They will scare me again.

311
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,740
They will kill me.

312
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,820
No one will be able to touch you.

313
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,150
As long as I am there.

314
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,360
Relax.

315
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,200
So Dhananjoy returned to Bankura...

316
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,450
...and then?

317
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,990
You've grown thin...

318
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,820
Where is the bugger?

319
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,950
Who is this bugger?
- Get up!

320
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,570
Get the Hell up!...

321
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,860
Where is Dhananjoy?
- Baba...

322
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,780
Get him out!
- Get the rascal out!

323
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,200
Get all the rascals out!
- So much screaming in the middle of the night...

324
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,450
So, you old sod!
I told you I'd be back!

325
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,860
Get in a line!
All of you...

326
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,070
Stand in line!

327
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,400
Didn't we tell you to stand?!

328
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,780
Where is the scoundrel?

329
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,900
Where is he?

330
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,570
Where is he?
- Get him out!

331
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,990
Where is he?
Why aren't you replying?

332
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,530
Where is Dhananjoy?

333
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,950
Sir! Come out back!

334
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,820
Let's move...

335
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,030
Wait, wait...
- Which way?

336
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,610
He's somewhere in this room.
The dog reacted here.

337
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,780
He must be hiding here.

338
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,280
Flash the lights...

339
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,200
Sir, I think he's on this side.
- Either here or there...

340
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,320
Must be here...

341
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,450
This side?
- Dhananjoy!

342
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,200
Come out now! Or else
we will skin you dry!

343
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,570
Come out now!
- Look here...

344
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,490
Sir, I-
- There he is!

345
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,990
Get out!
- I...

346
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,740
Get the bugger out!

347
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,820
Get the bloody scoundrel!
- Get out!

348
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,780
Hiding from the cops...
- Get him!...

349
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,820
Please don't mutilate
him in front of me.

350
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,030
No more in front of me...

351
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,030
Please take him away.

352
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,950
Come on!

353
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,110
Get the seizure list ready!

354
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,150
Get the car!
- Ma...

355
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,780
Give me some water.
- I will-

356
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,780
He wants water!

357
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,200
Get lost!

358
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,530
Oh no!...

359
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,530
My Dhana!...

360
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,490
My Lord...

361
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,450
...according to the testimony
of public witness number 3...

362
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,950
Mrs. Survi Parekh, the mother
of victim, Hema Parekh...

363
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,740
...on the day of the calamity, she had gone
to Laxmi Narayan Temple at 5:20PM...

364
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,700
and returned at 6:05PM

365
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,650
But at 5:25PM...

366
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,570
...the accused,
Mr.Dhananjoy Chatterjee...

367
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,860
...had visited Hema Parekh's flat...

368
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,400
...rung the bell at flat number 3A...

369
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,860
...and what happened next...

370
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,570
...was gruesome beyond imagination.

371
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,570
I need to make a call
to the agency.

372
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,240
Hmm.

373
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,780
Could I get some water?

374
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,610
Oh.

375
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,860
Yes...
The phone.

376
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,200
Not being able to connect...

377
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,400
So, are you done?

378
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,530
I have something to say to you...

379
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,780
Say it from where
you are standing.

380
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,700
Why? Don't you like me?

381
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,360
Please speak from afar!

382
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,530
Just listen to me...
- No!

383
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,240
No, please...
- Just hear me out...

384
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Stay away!
- But...

385
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,320
I have told my father about you.
- Just listen...

386
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,070
Just listen-
- No!

387
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,530
Why are you doing this?
- Just hear me out!

388
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,700
No!

389
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,030
Bloody skank!

390
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,530
The audacity to hit me?!

391
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,360
Take that!

392
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,150
Be quiet!
Don't you scream!

393
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,320
Stay down you harlot!
- Please let me go!

394
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,990
Open up!
- No!

395
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,200
Let me go!
I will tell my father about you!

396
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,650
Please let me go!

397
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,110
Please let me go!

398
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,740
Come!
- Please let me go!

399
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,860
Dhananjoy!

400
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,820
Dhananjoy?

401
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,570
I'm coming!

402
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,610
I shall speak the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

403
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,820
I shall speak the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

404
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,610
Dhananjoy Chatterjee...

405
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,360
What is your father's name?

406
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,200
Dhananjoy Babu?

407
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,990
Hmm?
- What is your father's name?

408
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,070
Soshibhu...
- What?

409
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,860
Mr.Soshibhushan Chattyopadhyay.

410
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,700
Mr.Soshibhushan Chattyopadhyay, very good...

411
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,990
So on the 5th of March you went to Hema Parekh's
flat where you raped and murdered her?

412
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,110
I didn't do anything of the sort-
- Umhum!

413
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,490
Tell that to the judge
and the court. Not me.

414
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,610
My Lord, I am innocent.
I have not done any of this.

415
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,700
On that day, I completed my shift by 2pm...

416
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,950
...and didn't return to
Sunanda Apartments after that.

417
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,740
When I was on duty in the morning,
I met Mr.Parekh. You could ask him?

418
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,200
Why would I do this?
I bear no enmity -

419
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,530
I understand that.

420
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,780
But Mr.Prabal Pati and security
guard Janak Raj Murmu...

421
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,610
...say they saw you there at 5:45PM.

422
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,990
Who said so?
They're lying!

423
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,200
Don't shout! This
is a court of law.

424
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,740
Mr.Ghosh, please...

425
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,700
Hmm. Tell me...

426
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,110
My Lord, I completed my shift
at 2PM and left that place.

427
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,780
Where did you go?

428
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,360
Huh?

429
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,110
Where did you go?

430
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,280
I had gone to the
cinema hall, My Lord...

431
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,990
At what time?

432
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,400
Umm... I had gone
for the 3PM show.

433
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,280
But Mr.Prati and
Mr.Murmu said...

434
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,990
...that when they called out to you, you poked
your head out of the verandah and called out to them?

435
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,490
Objection, My Lord!

436
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,150
Sustained.

437
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:21,740
Hmm.

438
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,400
My Lord, calling out from
the balcony would be unfeasible...

439
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,700
...because the verandah is grilled and there is not
enough space for one to stick his neck out.

440
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,320
He is right, My Lord.

441
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,820
I would like to present before the court,
a copy of the building's blue print.

442
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,900
Submit it at the time
of your argument.

443
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,110
Mr.Sen...

444
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,650
Thank you, My Lord.

445
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,110
Although his face may
not have been visible...

446
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,780
...they must have heard
his voice, My lord?

447
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,200
Objection, My Lord.

448
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,610
Go on...

449
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,530
The witnesses claim
to have seen him...

450
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,650
None of them said that
they only heard him.

451
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,950
Mr.Ghosh, will you keep
objecting throughout?

452
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,780
No, no...
Go ahead.

453
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,990
I have finished, My Lord.

454
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,700
If you wish to cross - examine, you
may proceed Mr.Ghosh.

455
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:05,280
Your Honour, my next witness is
Mr. Nishant Parekh, father of the deceased.

456
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,490
I would like to cross - examine him.

457
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,450
Good morning, sir.

458
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,990
How do you know that it was indeed
Dhananjoy, who murdered Hema Parekh.?

459
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,320
The liftman Dhanyaram
had informed my wife...

460
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,150
...that Dhananjoy had gone
to our flat to make a call.

461
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,450
On top of that we found
the chain and the button.

462
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,450
Hmm. So whose chain was it?

463
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,030
There's this man called Hari,
who works in our building.

464
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,990
He had given it to Dhananjoy as a gift
about a month before the incident.

465
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,030
Sir, he's lying.

466
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,820
He's lying!
- Wait a minute!

467
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,700
Did Hari tell you this?

468
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,450
Yes, sir.
- Ok.

469
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,900
So, Dhanyaram told your wife that
Dhananjoy had visited your flat?

470
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,780
Did Dhanyaram also tell her that Dhananjoy
had gone there to murder her daughter?

471
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,820
Then how can you be so sure-
- He used to harass my daughter!

472
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,030
He used to harrass my daughter, sir.

473
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,070
I had sent in a letter requesting
for him to be transferred but...

474
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,150
...he took his anger out on...

475
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,490
Hmm.

476
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,450
So, on the day of the incident...

477
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,780
...on the 5th of March, when you
left home in the morning...

478
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,900
...did you see Dhananjoy
doing his duty?

479
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,820
Yes, sir. I saw him.

480
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,070
Did you speak to him?

481
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,240
No.

482
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,820
Ok, Mr.Parekh.
Thank you so much.

483
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,530
Your Honour...

484
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,150
A metal chain was found
at the place of occurence...

485
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,450
...which belongs to someone else.

486
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,860
We cannot be certain about when
the owner of the chain presented it to my client.

487
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,360
So how can this prove...

488
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,950
...that the chain was around
Dhananjoy's neck and not Hari's?

489
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:58,780
How could everyone blindly believe
something that Hari said?

490
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,280
How could they believe
the chain was Dhananjoy's?

491
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,740
This reminds me of
Kafka's 'The Trial'.

492
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:13,240
A bank officer named Joseph
was arrested by the police.

493
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,450
He was arrested, tried and executed.

494
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,320
And the interesting thing is...

495
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,530
...that he was never told
what he was guilty of.

496
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,650
Even our story is one
of magic realism.

497
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,570
Like Kafka's 'The Trial'
or...

498
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,740
Camus's 'The Outsider'.

499
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,820
Now you've got my attention.

500
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,780
They've arrived.

501
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,150
Get him down.

502
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,400
Come here. Come here!

503
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,700
Let's go!

504
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,570
Move!
- Please step aside...

505
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,950
Please move aside...
- Just one question...

506
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,240
No comments please.
- Everyone keep your distance...

507
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,570
I am innocent!

508
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,820
Move it!...

509
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,450
Please stay back...

510
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,820
Dhananjoy Babu do you
know anyone named Hari?

511
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,530
Yes I do.
- Hmm.

512
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,240
Had Hari given you this
metal chain to wear?

513
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,150
No, I don't remember him
giving me anything like this.

514
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:21,780
Ok.

515
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,530
Dhananjoy Babu...

516
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,240
Does the button which was
found at the scene of the crime...

517
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,530
...belong to you?

518
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,030
No, My Lord, the button
sir is referring to...

519
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,860
...I mean the piece of clothing
that the button is a part of...

520
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,990
...is from the shirt I got for my wedding.

521
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,200
That shirt is still in Bankura.
I have never worn it in Kolkata.

522
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,860
No one in Kolkata has seen that shirt.
- Excuse me, My Lord?

523
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,150
There is a marked difference between
the testimony he is delivering here...

524
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,650
...and the statement he gave to the police.

525
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,240
You just said that you had
handed over the shirt to the police...

526
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,320
...and a button from this shirt was found by
Mr.Parekh at the scene of the crime.

527
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,990
Apart from this, My Lord...

528
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,950
...he had also stolen a Rico watch
from Mrs.Survi Parekh's almirah.

529
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,030
This watch was also recovered.

530
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:06,110
The police beat me silly while
I was delivering my deposition.

531
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,990
The shirt that sir is referring
to was in my wife's trunk.

532
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,030
I don't have any
shelves in my house.

533
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,530
When the police arrested me at Bankura,

534
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,360
I was wearing this lungi
and this sleeveless inner.

535
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,700
Then they told my family
that I will need clothes to wear in jail...

536
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,450
...then they got the clothes and are saying-
- Dhananjoy Babu!...

537
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,110
You are overstepping
your boundaries.

538
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,950
Answer the questions I ask and nothing more.

539
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,530
That's it, My Lord.

540
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,820
It's not over.
I'll be back.

541
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,570
He's all yours Ghosh Babu.

542
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,360
Your Honour, we all know...

543
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,530
...how much of a police
interrogation is the truth...

544
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,360
...and how much is forced.

545
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:02,030
We all still have questions about
Article 27 of the Evidence Act.

546
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,610
Objection, Your Honour!

547
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,990
Sustained.

548
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,740
From the Evidence Act, we may
only take that which can be proven.

549
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:15,150
In his deposition to the police, Dhananjoy
admitted that the button and the shirt...

550
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,030
...belonged to him.

551
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,030
So, doesn't this prove that...

552
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,320
...he is guilty.

553
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,280
Mr.Sen is right.
Is there anything else you would like to say?

554
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
Your Honour, all I have to say is...

555
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,950
... we are talking a
lot about this shirt...

556
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,400
...about the kinds of buttons it has, how it looks...

557
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,570
It has been heavily profiled.

558
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,990
But there is no mention
in any report about...

559
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,360
...what kind of pants
Dhananjoy was wearing.

560
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,780
So may we conclude that Dhananjoy's shirt
was of such great importance to the police...

561
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:55,530
...that they did not feel it was
necessary to look any further down?

562
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,400
Settle down...

563
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,740
On the 4th of March...

564
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,570
...the security agency
sent you a letter stating...

565
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,740
...that you are to no longer continue
working at Sunanda Apartments...

566
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,780
...as you have been transferred
to Mahesh Apartments.

567
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,780
Isn't that so?

568
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:15,700
Then why had you gone to work at
Sunanda Apartments on the 5th of March?

569
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,490
The letter...

570
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,990
What letter? My Lord, I never
received any such letter.

571
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,110
You didn't?
- No.

572
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,900
You had gone to watch a film, hadn't you?
Where's the ticket?

573
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,030
I did have the ticket.

574
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,740
The ticket, my wallet,
papers and money...

575
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,990
...were all seized by them
when they arrested me.

576
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,360
And now they're saying
that they don't have it.

577
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,860
Thank you, Your Honour.

578
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,320
I would like to ask the officer from the
Detective Department in charge of this case,

579
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,280
Sunil Basu Mullick a few little questions.

580
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,070
Sunil Babu?
- Yes.

581
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,900
According to the Investigation Report,

582
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,490
when Dhananjoy Chatterjee
came down the stairs at Sunanda Apartment's...

583
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,740
...what was he wearing?

584
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,650
Post interrogation we discovered that he
was wearing an off white bush shirt.

585
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,150
Were there any blood
stains on his clothes?

586
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,610
None of our witnesses
mentioned anything about it.

587
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,990
He must have had a torn button and...

588
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,860
...he must also have been panting.

589
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
No.

590
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,740
No one has mentioned
anything of the sort.

591
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,280
That's all, Your Honour.

592
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,780
Thank you, Mr.Basu Mullick.

593
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,740
Hmm.

594
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,650
Your Honour...

595
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:38,900
18 year old Hema Parekh
has apparently been...

596
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,700
...raped, murdered and...

597
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,650
...injured 21 times by the accused.
Who walked down in pristine condition after the event.

598
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,650
The accused enetered at around 5:20PM,

599
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,450
and left at around 5:45PM.

600
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,820
Let's consider that he commited these
attrocities within this window.

601
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,280
Remember, it is very strenuous exercise.

602
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:03,150
So those who had met
him post the incident,

603
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,740
did not notice whether
his button was torn,

604
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,030
or whether he had blood stains
anywhere on his clothing.

605
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,570
If a cinema ticket is considered as
a vital piece of evidence in this trial...

606
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,280
...then this information should
be given the same importance.

607
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,110
Dhanyaram Yadav...

608
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,240
...you are the liftman
at Sunanda Apartments?

609
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,280
Yes, Your Honour.

610
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,650
On the 5th of March, 1990...

611
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:41,490
...you had taken Dhananjoy Chatterjee
up in the lift to the 3rd floor?

612
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,530
No, Your Honour.

613
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:45,400
No, Your Honour.

614
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,570
No? What does he mean?

615
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,070
So, you had taken
Hema Parekh up to her flat?

616
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,110
This is also untrue, My Lord.

617
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,450
I didn't see Hema while
my duty was on till 2PM.

618
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:05,070
But you have told
the police otherwise.

619
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,200
You have told them that you
took Dhananjoy up to the third floor.

620
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,110
You also said that you
informed Survi Parekh...

621
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,820
...that you had taken Dhananjoy to her flat,
while she was coming up the lift with you.

622
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,820
You have said this
to the police yourself.

623
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,200
This is not true, My Lord.

624
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,990
I am an ignorant
and illiterate man.

625
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:27,950
The police wrote some things in English
and took my thumb print.

626
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,820
How am I to understand what they wrote?

627
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,150
Oh...

628
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,110
So, whatever you have
written as a witness...

629
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,200
...is all fabricated? Am I rig-

630
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,360
Objection, My Lord!

631
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,860
My learned friend is trying
to manipulate the witness.

632
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,990
Not at all, Mr.Sen.

633
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,950
Mr.Ghosh, you can continue.

634
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,490
Thank you, Your Honour.
- What is happening?

635
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,240
So... Dhanyaram Yadav...

636
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:57,490
...on the 5th of March, you never
once saw Mr.Dhananjoy Chatterjee?

637
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,280
No, My Lord, I saw him.

638
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,150
I saw him at 4PM-

639
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,110
Ok, so when did you
see Survi Parekh leave?

640
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,320
I saw Mrs.Parekh leave...

641
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,610
...for the temple at around 4:15PM

642
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,200
Saw her leaving for
the temple at 4:15PM?

643
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,110
Yes.

644
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,240
So at 4:15PM Survi Parekh
went to the temple.

645
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,610
Mrs. Parekh...

646
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,150
At 4:15PM?
- Yes, sir.

647
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,780
According to the prosecution's statement
Survi Parekh left for the temple at 5:20PM.

648
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,360
But Dhanyaram Yadav is
saying that she left at 4:15PM

649
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,360
Time, is a very important
factor in this case.

650
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,990
What happened after that?

651
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:43,320
Somewehere between 5:30PM and 5:45PM
while I was coming down with Karuna...

652
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,570
...I saw Dhananjoy
coming down the stairs.

653
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:50,990
At that time, did you see
any blood stains on his clothing?

654
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,860
No...

655
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,110
Were any of the buttons
of his shirt torn?

656
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,110
I didn't notice that much.

657
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,780
Point to be noted, My Lord...

658
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,070
...there is no direct
evidence in this case.

659
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,820
Till today, we were under the assumption that
Survi Parekh had gone to the temple at 5:20PM

660
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,400
If that can change to
4:15PM in an instant...

661
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,530
...then the calculations made by the
prosecution lose credibility.

662
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:22,650
And further, the testimony of all
previous witnesses lose credibility as well.

663
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,280
Objection, Your Honour!

664
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,570
What is there to object?

665
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,950
He has become discreditable.

666
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:28,530
Who?

667
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:30,450
The witness has become
completely discreditable.

668
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:34,450
Because he is denying everything he had
said to the police in his previous statement.

669
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,900
Mr.Ghosh, do you
have anything to say?

670
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,360
Because Dhananjoy is accused...

671
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,320
...all testimony delivered in this court against him...

672
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,450
...is admissable as the truth.

673
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,150
But the prime witness in the case...

674
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:51,820
...whose statement led
to the arrest of Dhananjoy...

675
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,450
...is now saying that he
did not say any of those things...

676
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:00,070
...then why won't that testimony be
admissable in this court, Your Honour?

677
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,820
Dr.Dipten Guha Roy...

678
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,700
Doctor Babu?

679
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,700
You conducted the
post-mortem in this case?

680
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,530
Yes, I did.

681
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,360
Please let the court know.

682
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,990
Ms.Hema Parekh...

683
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,360
...had 21 marks of
injury on her body.

684
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,650
She had scratch marks
on her face and lips and...

685
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,360
...her upper body had bruises
indicating that she had been punched.

686
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,570
And?

687
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,280
Her hymen was ruptured.

688
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,200
Ok. So what may we
conclude from this study?

689
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,450
Sexual intercourse had taken place but
it was preceded by roughhousing.

690
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,200
Your Honour, sexual intercourse
had taken place.

691
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,780
Preceded by roughhousing.

692
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,900
And in the report summary,
you have let the police know...

693
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,360
...that this was a case of rape and murder.
Isn't that so?

694
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,570
Yes.

695
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,150
How did you deduce
that roughousing was involved?

696
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:01,530
Your Honour, points number 14,16,17
and 18 of the post-mortem...

697
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,150
...that is the upper portion of the left hand,

698
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,450
the elbow,

699
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,700
the hip portion and the face,

700
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,860
...are laden with injuries.

701
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:15,570
This proves that Hema Parekh was
not involved in an act of consensual sex.

702
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,990
That's all. Thank you, Your Honour.

703
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,110
Please take over.

704
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,780
Mr.Ghosh?

705
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,700
Thank you, Your Honour.

706
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,360
Dr.Guha Roy,

707
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,150
in a letter to the
police you stated that...

708
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,200
...this was a case of rape and murder.

709
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,030
In your report you had written...

710
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:35,650
...'subjected to sexual intercourse.'

711
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,110
Do both these statements
mean the same, Dr.Guha Roy?

712
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,740
Subjected to sexual intercourse.

713
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,820
That is what's written in
the post-mortem report.

714
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,110
What gave birth to the rape theory?

715
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,280
What did the mother say as a witness?

716
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,450
Hema Parekh's mother, Survi Parekh...

717
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,900
...left the city soon after
her daughter's death.

718
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,900
She could not be
brought to court.

719
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,950
The court dates kept passing by
but she was not available.

720
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,860
Then the court was forced to file an order
demanding her presence within 2 hours.

721
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,400
So she had to come.

722
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,400
It is true that Dhananjoy...

723
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,530
...used to harass my daughter.

724
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:17,860
We had sent a letter of
complaint to the agency.

725
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:24,490
We had requested that he
be dismissed from his duty...

726
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,700
...and...

727
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,900
...in his anger, he killed my daughter.

728
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,570
He even stole a watch.

729
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,950
My Lord...

730
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,070
...this is the motive.

731
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:42,200
On the 2nd of March,
Mr.Nishant Parekh had written a letter...

732
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,820
... to the security agency requesting that
Dhananjoy be dismissed.

733
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,240
And the security agency...

734
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,530
...dispatched the transfer order
on the 4th of March...

735
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:56,030
...which stated that Dhananjoy Chatterjee
will no longer work at Sunanda Apartments...

736
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,070
...as he has been transferred
to Mahesh Apartments.

737
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,740
But Dhananjoy
disregarded the order.

738
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:06,780
He completed his duty at Sunanda Apartments
by 2PM on the 5th of March...

739
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:12,070
...then he left the apartment complex,
returned at 5:25PM and then...

740
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:19,450
...he raped and
murdered her daughter.

741
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,240
Thank you, My Lord.

742
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,820
Mr.Ghosh?

743
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,200
Thank you, Your Honour.

744
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,950
Mrs.Parekh...

745
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:35,780
Yes?

746
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,610
When you went to visit the temple...

747
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:41,780
...where did you keep
the keys to the flat?

748
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,570
Sir, I forgot.

749
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,150
My daughter was in the flat...

750
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,530
...so I overlooked it. I just
pulled the latch and left.

751
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,650
When you returned to the flat...

752
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,610
...and saw Hema's dead
body on the floor...

753
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:01,860
...for the first time...

754
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,780
Oh God!
- Oh my God!

755
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,320
...what did you think about?

756
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,360
I thought about taking
her to the hospital.

757
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,650
Hmm. But you didn't do that.

758
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:15,240
You were searching for
Dhananjoy inside the flat.

759
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,070
Dhananjoy...

760
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,280
Why?

761
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:24,450
Because Dhanyaram had said that Dhananjoy
had come to the flat just before me.

762
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,820
Yes.
- Hmm.

763
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:30,570
But then you were unable to find
Dhananjoy anywhere in the flat.

764
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:37,360
After which you took your daughter in your
arms and attempted to go to the hospital.

765
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:38,530
Someone get the lift?!

766
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,400
But you didn't go to the hospital.

767
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:48,360
Instead, you sat with her body
inside a lift for one hour.

768
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:49,780
Why?

769
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,950
Because...

770
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,900
...I couldn't take it, mentally.

771
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,570
And the doctor had
also declared her dead.

772
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,780
Sorry, Mrs.Parekh...

773
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:15,450
...you did not inform the police
of anything from 6PM to 9:15PM.

774
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:17,150
Why?

775
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:22,070
Sir...I was waiting for my husband.

776
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,240
Mrs.Parekh where were you at 4:15PM?

777
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:27,860
At home.

778
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,400
My daughter and I
were both inside the flat.

779
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,610
Right. Thank you Mrs.Parekh.

780
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,280
Please.

781
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,280
Your Honour...

782
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,530
...Mrs.Parekh claims that Dhanyaram
had informed her...

783
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:48,700
...that he had taken Dhananjoy to her flat
just before she returned.

784
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:54,280
That is why it was quite natural
for Mrs.Parekh to suspect Dhananjoy.

785
00:50:54,610 --> 00:51:00,950
But Dhanyaram claims that he
said nothing of the sort to Mrs.Parekh.

786
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:09,070
So then, how can we assume that my client
was present at the place of occurence?

787
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,530
Objection My Lord!

788
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,900
Sustained.

789
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,700
If we consider Dhanyaram's
testimony to be accurate...

790
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:21,200
...we must remember that he placed
Dhananjoy at Sunanda Apartments at 4PM.

791
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:29,110
Then Dhananjoy's alibi, where he stated that
he had gone to watch the matinee show...

792
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,490
...should also be regarded as untrue, My Lord.

793
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:37,200
And in addition to this
Dhanyaram also stated that...

794
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:45,490
...he saw Dhananjoy coming down the stairs
of Sunanda Apartments at 5:45PM

795
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,110
So, this proves that...

796
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,650
...no matter what time
Dhananjoy entered Sunanda Apartments...

797
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:56,650
...he walked down the stairs
of the apartment building at 5:45PM

798
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,150
Had Dhananjoy really gone
to watch a movie at 3? What do you think?

799
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:12,030
Sir, I think Dhananjoy's lawyer's had
a problem creating an alibi for him.

800
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,780
And Dhananjoy only said
what his lawyer's had taught him to say.

801
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,530
Hmm.

802
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,700
If he had gone to
watch a movie at 3PM...

803
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,950
...then it would not have
been possible for...

804
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:29,320
...that many witnesses to
have seen him at 5:45PM

805
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:30,400
Hmm.

806
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,700
And in an effort to prove that
he had gone to the cinema at 3PM...

807
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:40,450
...his lawyer overlooked the fact that
Dhanya had seen him upstairs at 4PM

808
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,400
And as a result of that,

809
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:50,280
no one cross-examined whether
Survi Parekh left for the temple at 4:15PM

810
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,530
Hmm.

811
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,860
That means, the inability
to prove an alibi...

812
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,530
...went against Dhananjoy?

813
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,200
Exactly, sir.

814
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:04,740
And this one lie...

815
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,450
...ruined him.

816
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,950
Please tell the court what
happened on the 12th of May?

817
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:15,860
Your Honour, on the 12th of May, we raided
Dhananjoy's house in the middle of the night.

818
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,530
And we found Dhananjoy
at his paternal uncle's house.

819
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,200
Prabhat Babu, where did you find...

820
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,110
...the evidence for the murder?

821
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:27,240
We found the shirt which matched the
button at the crime scene in Dhananjoy's house.

822
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,570
No! He's lying!

823
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,570
Sir, he beat me
mercilessly all night.

824
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,490
He assaulted me
in front of my family!

825
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,200
Now he's lying. He took my clothes!
- Don't shout!...

826
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,570
Ghosh Babu, tell them that he's lying!
- Silence!

827
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,860
He's lying...

828
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:49,280
Sir, I found the Rico watch.

829
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,400
Your Honour...

830
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:57,610
...this is the shirt which was
found at Dhananjoy's home at Chatna.

831
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,740
If you look closely at the shirt,
you will notice that...

832
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,030
...all the buttons are of the
same colour, except this one.

833
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:09,700
And this button, which was
found at Hema Parekh's house...

834
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:13,740
...matches the other
buttons on the shirt.

835
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:17,360
My Lord, these are all lies...

836
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,530
I am innocent, I haven't
done any of this. I'm innocent...

837
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,740
If you were innocent
then why did you run?

838
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,610
I didn't run! I had
taken off from work...

839
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:32,030
I had completed my duty at 2PM and
gone to the cinema for the 3PM show.

840
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,990
The next day was my brother Prakash's
thread ceremony, so I had taken off.

841
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,570
I am innocent, My Lord.
I haven't done any of this.

842
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,530
I swear that I'm
innocent, My Lord!

843
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,240
One cannot be
influenced by anyone.

844
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,650
Everyone got influenced
by everyone, sir.

845
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,860
From the day of the murder,
to the day of execution.

846
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,450
Media and society
played a major role.

847
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,450
A court outside court.

848
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,700
I can show you paper cuttings...

849
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:04,650
On the 6th of March every paper in
the city covered the incident.

850
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,570
But it wasn't till the
7th of March that...

851
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,650
...papers mentioned that Dhananjoy
used to harass Hema Parekh.

852
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,990
None of the papers mentioned
the stolen Rico watch.

853
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:16,900
If harassment and loss of
employment are motives for murder...

854
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,110
...then these issues should have been
brought forward on that night itself.

855
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,820
Why weren't they?
- Hmm.

856
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,490
Ok, tell me one thing...

857
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,990
...when did the police get a
hold of his transfer order?

858
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,570
They asked for the transfer order...

859
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,650
...and a letter from the security agency
which was dated 2nd of March,

860
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:34,400
was provided to the police in June.

861
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,610
March to June.

862
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,150
3 months, sir.

863
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,030
How could it take 3 months?

864
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,530
What do you think?

865
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,950
Sir, I think...

866
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:49,490
...the motive was created later on.

867
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:55,240
It took time to make the false papers
from the security agency look authentic.

868
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,150
And the media was continuously
putting pressure on the government...

869
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,360
...to punish the one
responsible as soon as possible.

870
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,490
You can read it in the
Supreme Court report.

871
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,070
I have read it.

872
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,650
The courts must not only keep
in view the rights of the criminal...

873
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,820
...but also the rights of the victim of
the crime and society at large,

874
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,200
while considering the imposition
of an appropriate punishment.

875
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:22,240
This wasn't a matter of
punishing a particular criminal.

876
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:28,490
Dhananjoy's execution was placed
as an example to society...

877
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:31,570
...exemplifying what happens
to those who commit such crimes.

878
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,650
If he is guilty then he
should be punished.

879
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,740
But without any direct evidence...

880
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:44,820
Only on the basis of circumstantial evidence,
how could someone be punsihed so harshly?

881
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:46,650
To be hanged till death...

882
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,950
Hey! Soshi Babu is coming!
- Let's go...

883
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,240
You have been conducting a Puja,
wishing for something...

884
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,650
What do you think?

885
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,530
Will your son be able
to escape the gallows?

886
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:07,740
Do you think that the decision
that has been taken can be overturned?

887
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:12,360
I have been praying to the
Holy Goddess all my life.

888
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,400
She has never
disappointed me.

889
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,360
And She will not start now.

890
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,110
My Dhananjoy...

891
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,950
...will return to me.

892
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,570
Soshi Babu...

893
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,610
Come.
- Thank you.

894
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,900
Go on, then...

895
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,740
A few days after the murder...

896
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,240
...a political leader from
the Gujarati Society...

897
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,900
...met the CM at the time...

898
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,530
...and requested that the case be
swiftly taken care of.

899
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,360
I've heard that the CM at the time...

900
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,740
...was so irritated with the delay in execution,
that he threatened to resign...

901
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,570
...if the culprit wasn't given
immediate punishment.

902
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,820
Really?

903
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:56,030
Political parties have a habit
of trying to please the public.

904
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:56,780
And then?

905
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,150
What more can there be?

906
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,820
The execution was announced.
- Hmm.

907
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,780
Dhananjoy's family
submitted a mercy plea...

908
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,400
...to the office of the president. But...

909
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:08,070
...it was not possible because
society was very active at the time.

910
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,280
No mercy pleas, no pardons...

911
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,650
The CM's wife at the time...

912
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,490
...held gatherings in
support of the hanging.

913
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,110
There were popular
articles documenting the fact...

914
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:23,150
...that the girl was raped
after she was murdered.

915
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,650
Hmm.
- Yes, sir.

916
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,030
And yes...

917
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:28,490
...everybody believed it.

918
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,400
Ofcourse they would.
She was the CM's wife after all.

919
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,280
Tea or coffee?
- Anything, sir.

920
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:37,860
Dhananjoy's family continuously wrote
letters to the press in his defence, but...

921
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,780
...not a single paper published
anything of the sort.

922
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,530
I won't be taking any calls now.

923
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,950
Come in.

924
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,650
Why did the public
have such a problem?

925
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:51,740
I don't know.

926
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:56,950
Let's assume that Dhananjoy
had committed the crime.

927
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,200
But then why was he kept
in jail for 14 years before he was hanged?

928
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,070
Didn't he get punished twice
for the same crime?

929
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,650
So you think the vote
bank was a major issue?

930
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,860
Yes, sir.

931
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:12,530
The Gujarati society is a huge
vote bank which no one wants to lose.

932
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:15,700
And the state government at the time
was allied with the centre.

933
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,320
And yes...

934
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,490
...politics played its
game at large.

935
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,450
And then?

936
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,490
15th August,

937
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:26,950
2004.

938
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,570
Dhananjoy?

939
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:55,990
Doctor Babu?

940
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,200
You have helped me a lot.

941
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,700
It's my job as a psychiatrist.

942
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:16,280
I'm feeling terrible today.

943
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:21,650
I wouldn't have come,
but the boy told me so...

944
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:25,280
Do you have a last wish?

945
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,860
You sing well...

946
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,490
...could you sing a song for me?

947
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,950
A Manna Dey song?

948
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:53,280
Could you get my harmonium
from my quarters?

949
01:00:53,990 --> 01:01:00,990
I hear the pitious call,
the sweet melody of life,

950
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:05,610
It says, "Come be with me."

951
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:13,240
Come be next to me...

952
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:26,570
This wonderous song is carried
by the wind across the ocean of life.

953
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:40,740
It asks me to run,
To come fast,

954
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:49,490
For here there is no death,
No angst of age,

955
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:57,280
It asks me to run,
To come fast,

956
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:03,400
For here there is no death,
No angst of age,

957
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,950
The wind here is
blooming with melody,

958
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:14,030
And the world is in elegant harmony,

959
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:19,530
It is evergreen,

960
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:24,490
And the moon in full bloom abounds,

961
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:36,070
This wonderous song is carried
by the wind across the ocean of life.

962
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,570
May you all be well.

963
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:08,740
I am being hanged
only because I am poor.

964
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:13,530
Please ensure that no innocent man
is sent to the gallows again.

965
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:17,860
May God bless you all...

966
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,860
(Groaning)

967
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,900
(Bird call)

968
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:34,700
Bloody witch! Call yourself Kali?

969
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,400
You are the rich man's Kali!

970
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:39,450
I will destroy you today!

971
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,740
So what is your observation?

972
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:44,820
One...

973
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,490
...when did the murder occur?

974
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:49,280
Two...was the victim raped?

975
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:53,530
Three, in what condition was
the food found in her stomach?

976
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:59,030
Four, most of the forensic tests were inconclusive.

977
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,150
Five...

978
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,950
...the stolen Rico watch,
the chain necklace...

979
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:07,530
...and the broken button need to
be examined for their credibility as evidence.

980
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,490
In solving a problem of this sort...

981
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:12,990
...the grand thing is to be able to reason backward.

982
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,240
Exactly.

983
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,450
Sir, the time span was
merely half an hour.

984
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,450
In which 21 injuries were inflicted.

985
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,570
The victim was murdered and raped.

986
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,950
The suspect stole a Rico watch and
called out from the balcony.

987
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,240
After which he interacted with 2 witnesses
and his clothing was prim and proper.

988
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:32,110
Why wasn't he more
discreet about the matter?

989
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:36,200
He stole the Rico watch and
kept it for 2 months.

990
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,240
He didn't sell it.
Not even in Rourkela.

991
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:42,070
It's as if he was waiting
for the police to find it.

992
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:43,570
Is it not strange?

993
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,200
Sir, there's one more thing.

994
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,320
After Dhananjoy's execution...

995
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,110
...his family didn't
accept his body.

996
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,700
It was said that even his family
were disgusted by him.

997
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:52,950
I understand.

998
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:55,950
If they accepted the body then they would
lose all rights to further judgement.

999
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,110
Exactly.

1000
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:58,700
Sir...

1001
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:05,610
...should I?

1002
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:06,950
You should.

1003
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,740
And I will assist you
on this case.

1004
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:14,610
Hmm.

1005
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:18,700
Thank you, sir.

1006
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,450
I can't do it.

1007
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,860
I can't.

1008
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,610
Why not Chandra?

1009
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:26,820
Don't you think...

1010
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:30,700
...we should explore
the doubts that we have?

1011
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,650
He's gone.

1012
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:37,360
But I know...

1013
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,030
...that he's innocent.

1014
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:42,490
Uncle!...

1015
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,150
Uncle...

1016
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,900
...the news is saying that
Dhana's case is being reopened.

1017
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:54,570
There's a female lawyer.

1018
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:57,150
She is creating a stir in Kolkata!

1019
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,200
Let me tell everyone!

1020
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:06,420
In the year 2004,
security guard Dhananjoy Chatterjee ...

1021
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:10,800
...was hanged for his involvement
in the Hema Parekh murder case.

1022
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:16,630
Today, advocate Kavya Sinha, is bringing
a new point of view on this case to the table.

1023
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:20,880
She is being assisted by her senior, the famous
Supreme Court advocate Shivraj Chowdhury.

1024
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,800
Kavya guarantees that new evidence shall be
brought to the forefront in this case.

1025
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,920
We will be back with
more news after this break.

1026
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:31,880
Mumbai
26th April, 2008

1027
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,500
I have nothing to say.

1028
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:34,800
Nothing.

1029
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,050
Ma'am, we know what you have-
- Go away!

1030
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,670
Go...

1031
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,050
I have said everything
I had to. Now go...

1032
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,960
Did Hema change in
front of you that day?

1033
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:57,340
Who are you?

1034
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:00,000
Who are you? Leave!
- Ma'am relax...

1035
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,460
Leave!
- The thing is...

1036
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:02,960
Mrs.Parekh...

1037
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:05,420
...this case is being reopened.

1038
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:08,840
Hope to see you soon.

1039
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,590
In court.

1040
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:35,000
Sir could you please tell us something?...
- Ma'am please...

1041
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:41,750
Ma'am please say something...

1042
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:43,590
Please tell us something?

1043
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:47,630
Circumstantial evidence
led to Dhananjoy's execution.

1044
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:52,960
We will take these pieces of evidence and
present an opinion contrary to the present verdict.

1045
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,420
You'll be really surprised.

1046
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:56,300
Thank you.

1047
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:59,130
Sir, madam, a few more questions...
- That's all for now.

1048
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,710
If Mr.Pati and Mr.Murmu
called out to Dhananjoy from here-

1049
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:50,800
Impossible.

1050
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,210
If they called him from here,
he'd have to come out.

1051
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,590
Exactly.

1052
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:59,380
Hema was a very sweet girl.

1053
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:01,380
I didn't know her that well...

1054
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:05,250
...but she used to visit this gentleman upstairs
who would help her with her lessons.

1055
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:09,420
On that day she
came here after school.

1056
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,460
Hello, Aunty.

1057
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,710
You had an exam?
- Hmm.

1058
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,300
How did it go?
- It was good. Ok, see you.

1059
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:19,550
What time was it?

1060
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:23,380
Some time in the afternoon...

1061
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,130
And then?

1062
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:27,340
Then I went to sleep.

1063
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:30,130
When I woke up,
I heard the ruckus.

1064
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:32,000
I found out that Hema had died.

1065
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:35,420
Didn't the police interrogate
you after the incident?

1066
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:36,800
Yes.

1067
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:39,210
But you weren't called
in as a witness?

1068
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,960
No.

1069
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:42,920
Sorry ma'am I can't speak to you.

1070
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,630
Dr.Bhasin, just 5 minutes. Tell me
whether you examined Hema Parekh or not?

1071
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,250
Just a little information.

1072
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,170
Please. I don't want to speak to you.

1073
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:51,880
Please!

1074
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,130
I can understand sir. But please if you coop-

1075
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,550
No. I'm sorry...

1076
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,550
You may go.

1077
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,590
Shivraj Chowdhury.
- Thanks.

1078
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:01,800
Kavya Sinha.

1079
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,050
Namaste.

1080
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:06,630
So...you knew Dhananjoy?

1081
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:08,050
Yes, of course.

1082
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:09,670
I beg your pardon.

1083
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:12,670
But you could speak in
Bengali if you wish.

1084
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:19,300
Sir, do you think that Dhananjoy was
capable of doing something like this?

1085
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:20,960
No.

1086
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,670
He was a strict boy.

1087
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:28,550
I have never heard of any occassion
where he has harassed or...

1088
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:30,750
... behaved badly with a girl.

1089
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:33,710
So you mean...

1090
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:38,670
So you had never heard of the times where
he had teased and harassed Hema Parekh?

1091
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,050
Never.

1092
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,420
Ever.

1093
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:46,630
At that time I was the president of
The Flat Owner's Association.

1094
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,340
But I have never heard
of anything like this.

1095
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:53,300
No one had even complained.

1096
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:58,130
And the talk of his transfer had
come to the surface much later.

1097
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:01,960
So these claims...

1098
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:04,170
So you were never
called in as a witness?

1099
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:05,670
No.

1100
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,880
Thank you Dr.Tandon.

1101
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:08,300
This is...

1102
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:12,460
How could such an important
witness not be called in?

1103
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:13,670
Yes, sir.

1104
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,840
You will notice that a lot
of important witnesses...

1105
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,880
...were never called.

1106
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,250
Strange...
- Ya.

1107
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,050
Yes?

1108
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,630
Satyajit Sanyal?

1109
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,130
Were you the OC of the Homicide department
at the time of the Dhananjoy murder case?

1110
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,300
I don't remember.

1111
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:38,090
We only want to ask a
few simple questions.

1112
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,250
I am not compelled to answer.

1113
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,920
That's true.

1114
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:44,920
But if you are called to court you
shall be compelled to answer.

1115
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:50,210
When was it confirmed that Dhananjoy
had indeed committed the crime?

1116
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,420
On the night of the murder itself?

1117
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:56,500
We collected all the evidence
in order to make our case.

1118
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:57,630
Are you sure you didn't
do it the other way around?

1119
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:58,630
What do you mean?

1120
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:02,460
Maybe the evidence was
placed in such a way that...

1121
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,050
...it would incriminate Dhananjoy?

1122
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,340
You are an advocate. Not a policeman.

1123
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:09,880
We have an investigative eye.

1124
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:14,710
And Satyajit Sanyal's intuition is always proved to
be accurate by the proceeding investigation.

1125
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,920
Exactly, sir.

1126
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:19,420
And this is why, when the body was
sent for a post-mortem report...

1127
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:23,250
...the police wrote a letter to the Professor of
Forensic and State Medicine saying that...

1128
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:28,090
'This appears to be
a case of murder and rape.'

1129
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:30,130
6th March, 1990. Am I right?

1130
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:32,380
'appears to be rape and murder.'
What's the problem with that?

1131
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,630
I understand that you
can assume it's murder but...

1132
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:37,670
...how did you know she was raped?
Could you see her and tell?

1133
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,300
Doesn't experience
count for anything?

1134
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:41,550
Of course it does-
- And observation!

1135
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:43,800
Exactly sir. Experience...
I understand. But...

1136
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,000
...21 injuries on the
face, neck and shoulders...

1137
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,960
...but no injuries on the
lower half of the body.

1138
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:48,420
So?

1139
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:52,380
I am sure that you have handled
many a rape case in your day but...

1140
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,250
...have you ever handled one where...

1141
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,050
...there are no injuries to
the lower half of the body?

1142
01:13:57,090 --> 01:14:00,130
All injuries limited
to the face, neck and shoulders?

1143
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,130
It was a consensual rape.

1144
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,130
What?

1145
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,630
We need to find out when
Mrs.Parekh actually returned home.

1146
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:21,880
Then we can accurately organise
a chain of events.

1147
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:37,500
Excuse me?

1148
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:42,340
Are you Prakash Chatterjee?

1149
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:48,460
Prakash, what else had
your brother told you?

1150
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:53,670
On the 5th of March, a little after 6 Dada was
returning to Bhowanipore after watching a film.

1151
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,130
On the way he met 2 people
from his security company.

1152
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:01,250
Shibu Da and Mujammal Haq.

1153
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,800
Dhana, what are you doing here?

1154
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,750
Why?
- The police are looking for you. Run!

1155
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,960
Why are they looking for me?

1156
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:08,550
Hema Parekh has been murdered.

1157
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:11,550
Not just that, she was raped aswell.

1158
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,840
They informed Dada
about the murder.

1159
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,800
Mujammal...

1160
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,670
Mujammal Haq is the
person who testified...

1161
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:24,880
...that he had handed over
Dhananjoy's transfer letter to him.

1162
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:27,500
And then?

1163
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,710
You are the prime suspect.

1164
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:29,590
Yes.
- Me?

1165
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,300
Yes, you.
- What rubbish!

1166
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:33,420
Take my advice...

1167
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:35,420
Just get out of here.
Come with us.

1168
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:39,210
Wait, wait. So much has happened,
let me go and see it for myself.

1169
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:43,170
You bloody idiot! If you go there now
all of us will be in trouble!

1170
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,050
We don't have much
time. Let's go!

1171
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:48,460
Where am I to go? I need to go to
my village for Prakash's thread ceremony tomorrow.

1172
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,960
I have bought fruits for-
- Are you a fucking idiot?

1173
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:54,630
The police are looking
everywhere for you and...

1174
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:57,380
Let's go. We'll explain later.
- Where are we going?

1175
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:01,000
Why are they accussing me?
- Just come with me!

1176
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,960
I am taking you to the
right place. Trust me.

1177
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,630
Mujammal, get in to the car.

1178
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:08,460
What have I done?
- If they catch you nothing will matter.

1179
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,090
Dhana just trust us.

1180
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,800
In a few days this case will die down.
Then you can return.

1181
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,710
Move it!

1182
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:22,000
The car dropped my brother to
the Bhirni crossing at Durgapur and left.

1183
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,130
Oh Mona Da!

1184
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:06,750
Are you inside the house?

1185
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,550
Mona Da?

1186
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:10,750
Mona Da?

1187
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,710
Mona Da, I was saying...

1188
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,500
...do you have a big pot?

1189
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:17,380
We need it for the
thread ceremony.

1190
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:20,090
And Ma is asking you and
your wife to hurry up.

1191
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:25,170
What happened Dada?

1192
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:27,170
How come you're here?

1193
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:31,300
Why are the police
looking for you?

1194
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,420
There's been some
trouble in Kolkata.

1195
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,250
Oh no!

1196
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:40,800
It will sort itself out
in a couple of days.

1197
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:46,750
Don't think about it.
Concentrate on your thread ceremony.

1198
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,130
Yes...

1199
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,880
And tell our parents that I will come and
see them when things cool down.

1200
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:54,920
Don't talk about this.
Don't tell anyone!

1201
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:57,630
Now, go.

1202
01:17:57,670 --> 01:17:59,670
And listen...

1203
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:04,460
Tell my wife to
meet me if she can.

1204
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:08,050
Now go.

1205
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,460
Don't tell anyone!

1206
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,300
Get inside.
- Huh?

1207
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:15,050
Get inside!

1208
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:28,460
He came home
only once after that.

1209
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:32,710
Ma fed him a plate full
of rice and told him to run.

1210
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,420
He went to Rourkella after that?
- I could do nothing!

1211
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:39,130
Nothing...

1212
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,840
The truth will be told.
- What?

1213
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,250
It will never be told!

1214
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,000
We know the truth!
Everyone here knows the truth!

1215
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:50,000
I have carried the
truth for so long!

1216
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:54,550
If I say it, they'll shiver in their chairs!
The Babu's dirty laundry will come out.

1217
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,840
Such contradictory statements.

1218
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,130
He hasn't been
cross-examined properly.

1219
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,460
You'll notice it, if you take
a look at the court papers.

1220
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:20,750
So many witnesses
came and went but...

1221
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,880
...Dhananjoy's lawyer never felt it was
necessary to cross-examine them.

1222
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,380
And the ones he did
cross-examine had no impact.

1223
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,670
He seemed to have lost
interest in the case. Let's go.

1224
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,300
And Prakash said that
they couldn't bear the cost.

1225
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:36,380
Why are you bothering me?

1226
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:38,460
How can I work
without money?

1227
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,920
You are already behind on your
dues and this is a long case.

1228
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
We have already mortgaged our land.
We will get the money soon.

1229
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:49,420
Please don't drop the case.
Save my brother.

1230
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,210
I will get you the money.

1231
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,880
I will sell my land.

1232
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,170
I will sell my wife's jewellery
but please save my son.

1233
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,300
Save my son.

1234
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,420
Prakash...

1235
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,250
The more sugar you add
the sweeter it will be.

1236
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:08,800
If you pay, I'll do my job.
Or else he hangs.

1237
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,170
Hey!
- What is he saying?

1238
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:11,880
Sir!

1239
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:13,170
Have a seat.

1240
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,300
Would you like some tea?
- Yes.

1241
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:16,500
They put a lot of milk...
- That's fine.

1242
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:18,170
Two tea...
Where did he go?

1243
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,170
Look here. Two teas.

1244
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:23,050
There's just one
thing that I don't get.

1245
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:27,840
If I go by what
Dhananjoy's brother said...

1246
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,800
...it seems that
Mujammal and Shibu...

1247
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:36,210
...arranged for the car
before they met Dhananjoy?

1248
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,000
Dada...

1249
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,630
Sir...

1250
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:41,130
...will a man who earns
800 rupees a month...

1251
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:45,340
...ever think of escaping in a car?

1252
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:48,340
No. His first option will be a bus.

1253
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,670
Or a train. Isn't it?

1254
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,960
You're saying someone arranged it?

1255
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,380
Maybe.

1256
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:00,670
It may also be that the car had
arrived for some other purpose but...

1257
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,500
...was not needed.

1258
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:05,250
What are you saying?
- Yes, sir...

1259
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:12,300
Let's say the car had come
to take Hema Parekh's body away.

1260
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,300
But it wasn't possible because
the crowd was too thick.

1261
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,920
And that car takes
Dhananjoy away.

1262
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:22,500
Ok. So why didn't Dhananjoy
say all of these things?

1263
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:26,710
His lawyer kept trying to prove
his 3PM cinema alibi.

1264
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,460
He had no other alibi to present.

1265
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:31,250
I think...

1266
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,630
...Dhananjoy was told
not to say these things.

1267
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,380
Interesting.

1268
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:41,050
I heard they had found Dhananjoy with a
bloodied shirt in the generator room.

1269
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:43,340
This isn't true, is it?
- Absolute rumour.

1270
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,000
The seizure report
has no mention of it!

1271
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:49,300
So, Dhananjoy didn't live in the generator room?
- No.

1272
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,840
Dhananjoy lived at
Binapani School.

1273
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,550
And the generator room
mentioned is a 15x5 foot room...

1274
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:59,090
...which houses a 7X4 foot generator.

1275
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:00,340
As well as other things.

1276
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:03,590
It's not possible for
a person to live there.

1277
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:08,630
But Hema Parekh's family
claimed that he lived there.

1278
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,090
Why?

1279
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,550
Sir, it's very obvious.

1280
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:16,170
If the police don't find a suspect
at the place where he lives...

1281
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:20,420
...then it makes it obvious that he has
fled and he becomes a suspect.

1282
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,460
Good.

1283
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:33,710
Why is there so much
noise in the court room?

1284
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,630
Please settle down.

1285
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,300
Ms.Kavya Sinha,
you may proceed.

1286
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:42,050
Your Honour...

1287
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:47,880
...there are no eye witnesses to the Hema
Parekh rape and murder case on 5th March, 1990.

1288
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:55,460
The court sentenced Dhananjoy to death
on the basis of circumstantial evidence.

1289
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:58,710
No matter what the
outcome of this case may be...

1290
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:02,050
...two souls will still
be lost to us forever.

1291
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:05,590
Dhananjoy Chatterjee
and Hema Parekh.

1292
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:10,090
There are some irregularities
in this particular case...

1293
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:12,340
...which had escaped
the view of others.

1294
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:15,670
If we can tie these
irregularities together...

1295
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:18,920
...we may be able to
come up with a different conclusion.

1296
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:23,880
Ms.Kavya Sinha, are you
talking about a conspiracy theory?

1297
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:27,380
No, Sir. I am not
saying that the police force...

1298
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:30,920
...or the legal practitioners of the time
were involved in a conspiracy.

1299
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:35,210
But the irregularities give birth
to a number of questions.

1300
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:38,340
I don't know if Dhananjoy Chatterjee
is innocent or not.

1301
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:41,920
But I want to show the court
what the outcome may have been...

1302
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,590
...if the case was looked at differently.

1303
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,130
In the course of this trial...

1304
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:51,460
...you shall see that Dhananjoy Chatterjee
has been persecuted by destiny...

1305
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:54,550
...in the manner of a Greek Tragedy.

1306
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,380
He was destined to be hanged.

1307
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:58,710
A number of irregularities
could not save him.

1308
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:03,090
There were many instances where
witnesses could have been cross-examined...

1309
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:07,000
...to prove that Dhananjoy Chatterjee
should have been given the benefit of the doubt.

1310
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:09,090
But that did not happen.

1311
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,460
Proceed.

1312
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,840
Thank you, Your Honour.

1313
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:21,710
Your Honour...

1314
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,630
...Dhananjoy Chatterjee had
murdered Hema Parekh.

1315
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,340
His main motive was
said to be revenge.

1316
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:32,170
Dhananjoy Chatterjee used to
harass Hema Parekh.

1317
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,380
So be it.

1318
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:37,710
A written complaint was lodged by
Hema Parekh's father...

1319
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:39,710
...Nishant Parekh.

1320
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:43,170
He was the chairman of the
Flat Association at the time.

1321
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,750
I would like your permission
to call him to the witness box.

1322
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:48,710
Proceed.

1323
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:51,300
Mr.Parekh...

1324
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:56,050
...when had you left home on
the day of Hema Parekh's murder?

1325
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,380
Around 10-11AM

1326
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,420
In your testimony
you had stated that...

1327
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:05,340
...you had met Dhananjoy Chatterjee
on your way out that day.

1328
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,800
He was on duty. Am I right?

1329
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,130
Yes.

1330
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:12,000
Didn't you say anything to him?

1331
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:14,130
No.

1332
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:15,550
Why?

1333
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,550
In accordance to your complaint,
Dhananjoy should have been transferred by then.

1334
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:23,460
And yet he was still
working at your house.

1335
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,960
Didn't you want to know why?

1336
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,420
No...

1337
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,750
You were the chairman of
the Housing Association.

1338
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,460
He was working inspite of your complaint.
Why didn't you say anything?

1339
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:37,590
No.

1340
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:41,050
Mr.Parekh, I will read a few lines
from your written complaint...

1341
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,840
...and you tell me whether
you have written it or not.

1342
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:45,420
Hmm.

1343
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:53,460
'This is to inform you,
my daughter Ms.Hema Parekh...

1344
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,460
...an 18 year old student of
Welland Goldsmith...

1345
01:27:56,590 --> 01:28:00,460
...was regularly teased
and harassed by Dhananjoy Chatterjee...

1346
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,170
...a security guard.

1347
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:06,300
Did you write this?

1348
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,920
Look closely.

1349
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:14,500
Yes, I wrote it.

1350
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,250
Your Honour...

1351
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:21,250
...the language of the letter written to the
agency makes me suspiscious.

1352
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:25,090
If there's a problem with the guard
just be direct and remove him.

1353
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:27,880
This sounds like a
formal testimony.

1354
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:28,960
To be precise...

1355
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,170
...these kinds of testimonies
are written in police stations.

1356
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:32,670
Objection, My Lord.

1357
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:37,590
How can we judge the merit of a case on
the basis of how someone writes a letter?

1358
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:39,800
No, no, Mr.Kar.

1359
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:43,380
This objection can't be sustained.
Please sit down.

1360
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:47,210
Thank you, Your Honour.

1361
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:50,590
Dhananjoy Chatterjee used to
harass my daughter.

1362
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:56,630
Why has the harassment
moved to the past tense?

1363
01:28:57,210 --> 01:28:59,500
It may be a small
grammatical error.

1364
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:02,380
Because when this
complaint was written...

1365
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:05,750
...Ms.Parekh's existence
was already in the past.

1366
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:23,800
I would like to cross-examine the witness
while Kavya settles the papers.

1367
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,630
May I, Your Lordship?
- Proceed, Mr.Chowdhury.

1368
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,500
Thank you.

1369
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:31,210
So, Bimal Babu...
I hope you are doing well?

1370
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,630
Yes...
- Good.

1371
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,380
What is your security company's
payment procedure?

1372
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:37,630
The employees sign vouchers and-

1373
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:38,630
Please address the court.

1374
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:39,840
The employees are
made to sign vouchers.

1375
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,670
The employees get paid once
they have signed a voucher. Good.

1376
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:45,960
Do you offer gratuity
or a provident fund?

1377
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:46,920
No.

1378
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,420
Medical earned leave?

1379
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,170
No.
- Objection, Your Honour!

1380
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,670
I think my learned friend intends
to open an employment exchange.

1381
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,630
You never know,
my dear learned friend.

1382
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:56,670
Fate commands us all.

1383
01:29:56,710 --> 01:29:58,750
So let's come back to the point.

1384
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,460
You have none of this but the format for
your transfer orders are completely by the book?

1385
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:04,960
Yes.

1386
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:07,460
And such a transfer order
was handed to Dhananjoy,

1387
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:09,710
stating that he had been
transferred to Mahesh Apartments?

1388
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,340
Dhananjoy Chatterjee has
repeatedly denied this fact.

1389
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:17,130
He claims to have had
no idea of the transfer.

1390
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:20,090
Your Honour, Dhananjoy had said
a lot of things which weren't necessarily true.

1391
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:22,920
Mr.Kar, we are here
to uncover the truth.

1392
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:27,130
So, Bimal babu is this
the transfer order...

1393
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,340
...that had been sent
to Dhananjoy Chatterjee?

1394
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:31,340
Yes.
- Ok.

1395
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,710
This is the transfer order that had been
sent to transfer Dhananjoy to Mahesh Apartments.

1396
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:40,460
And Ajay Thapa was supposed to be
his replacement at Sunanda Apartments.

1397
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,710
So if this is
Dhananjoy Chatterjee's transfer order...

1398
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,130
...where is Thapa's?

1399
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:49,250
Why are you looking in that direction?
Look at me.

1400
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:50,000
No...

1401
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:51,800
I'm asking you a simple question.

1402
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:56,340
Was it sent? And if it was,
then why wasn't it presented in court?

1403
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:57,920
Simple question.

1404
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:00,500
Your Honour, Ms.Sinha
will take over from here.

1405
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:02,130
No, no, I have an objection!

1406
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:03,800
What are you objecting to?

1407
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:07,170
Thapa's transfer order has
nothing to do with case.

1408
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:09,130
Please sit down.

1409
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:11,000
Please, Ms.Sinha...

1410
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:12,550
The transfer order is
connected to this case.

1411
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:16,460
Because this transfer order
gave birth to Dhananjoy's motive.

1412
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:17,920
Bimal Babu...

1413
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:21,050
...when did Mr.Nishant
Parekh inform you that...

1414
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:23,420
...Dhananjoy Chatterjee used to
harass Hema Parekh?

1415
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:25,380
The date on the letter
is the 2nd of March.

1416
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:27,050
The 2nd of March.

1417
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:29,630
When was the transfer order issued?

1418
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,460
2 days after that.

1419
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:34,590
2 days after...that means
the 4th of March, right?

1420
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:35,460
Yes.

1421
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:39,090
But on the 5th of March
Nishant Parekh saw Dhananjoy...

1422
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:42,590
...working at the building
but said nothing.

1423
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:43,250
Why?

1424
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,250
Your Honour...
- So-

1425
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:47,880
...maybe he was
unmindful at the time.

1426
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,500
But we have the papers.
The documentation. The proof.

1427
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:52,300
I object, my friend.

1428
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,170
Proceed, Ms.Sinha.

1429
01:31:54,210 --> 01:32:00,750
The document he is referring to, reached
the police 4 months after Hema Parekh's death.

1430
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:02,800
Why did it take that long?

1431
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,130
No one asked for the transfer order
on the day after the murder?

1432
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:10,250
And there is a reason
for that, Your Honour.

1433
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:14,630
The reason is that Bimal Babu
was not in Kolkata at the time.

1434
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,300
Isn't that so, Bimal Babu?

1435
01:32:17,630 --> 01:32:19,500
Don't nod your head.
Say yes or no.

1436
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:20,960
Yes.

1437
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:22,710
Where were you?

1438
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:25,090
Where were you?

1439
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:26,750
Ok. I'll tell them.

1440
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,710
Your Honour, he was in Mumbai.

1441
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:31,550
He got news of Hema Parekh's
death and returned.

1442
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:34,920
But Mr.Prabal Pati had already
submitted a statement to the police...

1443
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,460
...and he submitted his
statement on the 9th of March.

1444
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:42,090
But prior to this, no newspaper had
printed anything about the transfer order...

1445
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:45,250
...because the transfer order
had never been issued.

1446
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:46,670
Sir...

1447
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:51,840
Your Lordship, I have just
one question to ask Bimal Babu.

1448
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,460
Bimal babu, this Prabal Pati...

1449
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:57,460
...the gentleman, who is your supervisor.

1450
01:32:57,550 --> 01:33:02,880
He had gone to check whether Dhananjoy
was working in the correct building.

1451
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,920
Had he also gone to check whether
Ajay Thapa was working in the correct building?

1452
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:09,630
I don't know.

1453
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:12,670
Your Honour, these papers have
been accepted by three courts already.

1454
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:16,300
I am not saying that they
haven't been accepted.

1455
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,800
We are trying to find out
if the incident occured.

1456
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,960
Whether Dhananjoy Chatterjee
actually harassed Hema Parekh.

1457
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:26,880
Or whether it was all arranged
to falsely convict Dhananjoy Chatterjee...

1458
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,670
...of murder and rape.

1459
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:31,050
It's a nice story, but...

1460
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:34,050
...the truth is stranger
than fiction, my friend.

1461
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:38,550
Your Honour, with your permission we
would like to discuss the proceeding events.

1462
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:39,670
Proceed.

1463
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,210
Thank you.

1464
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,590
What took you so long?

1465
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:51,250
Your Honour...

1466
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:56,050
...according to the information provided,
Survi Parekh had gone to the temple at 5:20PM

1467
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:58,630
But there is a notebook entry
which says it was 6:05PM

1468
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:03,710
On that night the DCDD informed reporters
that she had returned at 5:50PM

1469
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:07,420
At around 5:50PM Hema Parekh's mother...

1470
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:12,460
...returned home after attending the aarti
at the Laxmi Narayan Temple.

1471
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:16,550
So the duration we have
to work with is from 5:20PM to 5:50PM

1472
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,300
Half an hour.

1473
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,550
What all did Dhananjoy
do in this half hour?

1474
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:25,840
Firstly, he was wearing an
off white shirt when he went up.

1475
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,000
But the colour of the shirt
changed once he entered the flat.

1476
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:31,340
And after that...

1477
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:48,500
I'm coming!

1478
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:50,920
Your Honour,

1479
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:55,420
for Dhananjoy to be able to do all of this
and still make his way down in time,

1480
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:57,840
he would have to be a superhero.

1481
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:01,050
And when Mr.Pati saw him,
he could not make out...

1482
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:03,880
...that the 3rd button of
his shirt was missing.

1483
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:06,250
...or that he had been a
part of a bloody brawl.

1484
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:08,800
Your Honour, it has been
previously proven in court...

1485
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:12,840
...that Dhananjoy took off
his clothes before engaging.

1486
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:18,000
So Dhananjoy did not pick up
the button that had fallen off his shirt...

1487
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:22,960
...and while he was undressing,
Hema Parekh was just sitting idle?

1488
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,800
How can we be sure that
Hema Parekh did not scream?

1489
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,670
Maybe her voice didn't
reach the ground floor.

1490
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:34,590
So, Hema Parekh's voice didn't travel down but
Janak Murmu could be heard from the ground floor?

1491
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,800
Right?

1492
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:44,710
It was understood that it was impossible for
Dhananjoy to complete this act in half an hour...

1493
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:50,750
...that's why the time of
Survi Parekh's return was changed to 6:05PM

1494
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:55,840
With your permission, Your Honour,
I want to look at the post mortem report and...

1495
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,420
...I would like to invite Dr.Guha Roy
to the witness box.

1496
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:00,960
Proceed.

1497
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:09,420
So, Dr.Guha Roy.
What were your observations?

1498
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:15,550
My Lord, there was semen on
the pubic hair of the victim.

1499
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,840
There was food in her stomach and...

1500
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:20,590
...there were 21 signs
of injury on her body.

1501
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:22,750
How did she die?

1502
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:25,550
That... I don't...

1503
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:27,050
May I?

1504
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:32,250
The cause of death as
revealed by autopsy...

1505
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:37,340
...was smothering by strangulation,
anti-mortem and homicidal in nature.

1506
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,550
Yes.
- Right?

1507
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:45,050
Was it a one man murder?

1508
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:46,840
Yes.

1509
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:48,460
Then...

1510
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:51,500
..how is it possible to
smother by strangulation?

1511
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,960
I think that should be
smothering and strangulation.

1512
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,130
Must be a mistake.

1513
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:00,300
A mistake?

1514
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,460
You have stated in the
post mortem report that...

1515
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:06,590
...she was subjected to intercourse.

1516
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:08,300
Am I right?

1517
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:09,250
Hmm.

1518
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:13,130
Actually her hymen had been
ruptured and there was bleeding.

1519
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:15,630
She was subjected
to intercourse.

1520
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:21,710
There is a huge difference between
being subjected to intercourse and rape.

1521
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,960
So why didn't you write rape?

1522
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,550
She had had physical relations...

1523
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:30,170
It may have been consensual?

1524
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:33,050
Right?

1525
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:38,750
There was no semen present on
Hema Parekh's vaginal swab.

1526
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:43,710
Dr.Guha Roy, I'm not sure if you
have ever seen a rape case where...

1527
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:47,800
...the semen has been found
outside the victim's body.

1528
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:51,250
So how could this have been rape?

1529
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,340
Generally Your Honour,

1530
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,500
when the victim and the accused
are engaged in a scuffle...

1531
01:37:56,590 --> 01:38:00,550
...then skin samples from the accused tend
to be found in the nails of the victim.

1532
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:04,630
If this had happened, DNA samples taken
from Dhananjoy could have been tested for a match.

1533
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:05,960
But that never happened.

1534
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:10,170
Because nothing except blood
was found under Hema Parekh's nails.

1535
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:13,550
Maybe Hema Parekh didn't get
the chance to defend herself.

1536
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:18,090
Hema Parekh had the chance
to defend herself but her attacker...

1537
01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:21,380
...was a person whom she could not...

1538
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,170
...hurt.

1539
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:25,340
Objection, My Lord!

1540
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:27,960
I don't understand what
Ms.Sinha is trying to prove.

1541
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:29,800
Who was Hema Parekh's attacker?

1542
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,750
Was Dhananjoy not there?
Did he not rape her?

1543
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,170
Sustained.

1544
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:37,380
Ms. Sinha, how can you prove
that she was not raped?

1545
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:42,500
I would like to refer to the
post mortem report once again.

1546
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:47,750
Dr.Guha Roy, Hema Parekh
was wearing a shirt. Am I right?

1547
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:50,170
Yes.
- She was wearing a brasier too?

1548
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:53,210
Her skirt was on aswell but
she was missing a pantie.

1549
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:58,670
So, my friend is trying to say that Hema
was raped with all her clothes on...

1550
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,670
...and then her panties were taken off
and thrown away. Right?

1551
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:03,130
Thank you doctor.

1552
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:05,630
The witness is all yours Mr.Kar.

1553
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,050
Good.

1554
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:08,920
You're doing great.

1555
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,210
Just one little suggestion.

1556
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,130
Don't be emotional in the courtroom.
It might ruin the case.

1557
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,800
Hmm.

1558
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:30,710
The water comes with the ship...

1559
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,090
Hey Janank Da!

1560
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:34,090
I'm going up to
Mr.Parekh's flat.

1561
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:36,250
I need to call the agency.
- Hmm.

1562
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:37,750
Mr.Janak Raj,

1563
01:39:38,210 --> 01:39:40,800
what was Dhananjoy's job
at Sunanda Apartments?

1564
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,500
He was a guard.

1565
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:49,460
He also used to change light bulbs, pay
electricity bills and a few other odd jobs.

1566
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,460
Did people ask him
to do these things?

1567
01:39:52,670 --> 01:39:55,710
Yes. He used to shop for people too.

1568
01:39:57,050 --> 01:40:02,170
Did he take your permission to go up
when he had to do these little odd jobs?

1569
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:10,340
Did he take your permission to go up
when he had to do these little odd jobs?

1570
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:12,590
No.

1571
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:17,460
Then why did he ask for your permission-
-Objection My Lord!

1572
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:21,670
We must keep in mind that he was no longer
a security guard of the building at the time.

1573
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:25,130
He spoke to Murmu as an outsider.

1574
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:26,420
Sustained.

1575
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:30,000
Ms.Sinha, please
be more specific.

1576
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:31,840
Ofcourse, Your Honour.

1577
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:38,550
The prosecution claims that Dhananjoy used to
live in the generator room of the apartment.

1578
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:42,170
I severely doubt that fact,
but let us accept it for now.

1579
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:44,800
So, he lived in the
generator room.

1580
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:49,130
If he lived in the generator room,
then that was a part of the house.

1581
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,460
So then, why would he need permission?

1582
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:55,340
So Dhanyaram Ji, did the people
who worked at Sunanda Apartments...

1583
01:40:55,670 --> 01:40:59,420
...as in the maids and guards,
use the lift to travel?

1584
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:04,300
No, My Lord. They
would use the stairs.

1585
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:06,460
They all used the stairs?
- Yes.

1586
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:08,090
Point to be noted, Your Honour.

1587
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:10,960
There was no reason for
Dhananjoy to use the lift.

1588
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:15,250
And if he didn't use the lift
then how could he have met Dhanyaram.

1589
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:19,460
So Dhanyaram, at what time
did you see Dhananjoy?

1590
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:24,340
From what I remember
it was around 4PM.

1591
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:25,840
4PM?
- Yes.

1592
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,670
4PM?
- Yes, 4PM

1593
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,550
Who did you see
coming down after this?

1594
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:33,340
After that...

1595
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:38,590
Yes! The next person was Mrs.Parekh,
who was off to the temple.

1596
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,380
Objection, My Lord!

1597
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:43,920
She had gone to the temple
to take part in the aarti at 5:20PM

1598
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:45,800
There's a confusion,
Your Honour.

1599
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:50,500
The aarti begins at 5:30PM and it takes
her 10 minutes to reach from her home.

1600
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,050
And she had left
for home by 5:50PM?

1601
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:58,380
So in order to take part in the aarti
when exactly did she leave home?

1602
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:00,550
Objection overruled!

1603
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:04,880
Dhanyaram Ji...

1604
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,210
...when did you see
Dhananjoy next?

1605
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:10,670
I saw him at around...

1606
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:14,590
From what I can
remember, My Lord...

1607
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:17,090
...at around 5:30-5:45PM...

1608
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:20,550
...I had seen him
climbing down the stairs.

1609
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:27,130
Had you seen him at 1PM,
when Hema returned from school?

1610
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:35,170
Hema didn't return
home till 2PM

1611
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:37,340
That's for sure.

1612
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:39,170
It's unbelievable, Your Honour!

1613
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:43,210
Survi Parekh had stated that
Hema returned home at 1PM

1614
01:42:43,550 --> 01:42:45,800
Dhanyaram's testimony has
been completely altered.

1615
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,670
He is contradicting everything.

1616
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:49,420
You can see for
yourself, Your Honour...

1617
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:51,920
...all our previous witnesses have
made contradictory statements.

1618
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,130
So why is Dhanyaram
being called a liar?

1619
01:42:54,630 --> 01:43:00,000
I think everyone made their moves on
the basis of Dhanyaram's testimony.

1620
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:14,960
Dr.Guha Roy, according to
the post mortem report...

1621
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:18,500
...the weight of the undigested
food was 100 grams. Right?

1622
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:20,710
Yes, actually...

1623
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:23,250
...it's been 18 years so...

1624
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:25,840
...you don't remember?

1625
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:28,250
Very strange, Your Honour.

1626
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:30,340
People remembered everything for 14 years.

1627
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:33,420
But 4 years after the hanging
they've forgotten everything!

1628
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:35,050
Anyway...

1629
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:41,380
...how long would it take an 18 year old girl
to digest 100 grams of food?

1630
01:43:41,670 --> 01:43:43,500
3 hours?
- Yes.

1631
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:46,710
Had the food retained it's
original colour and texture?

1632
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:49,460
The food wasn't
completely digested.

1633
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:55,090
So how long before
her death did she eat?

1634
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:57,710
An hour or two before her death.

1635
01:43:58,710 --> 01:44:03,300
I would like to present some paper cuttings
from the 6th of March which mention that,

1636
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:05,300
Hema Parekh's hands
and legs had been broken.

1637
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:06,840
Objection, My Lord!

1638
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:09,500
There is no mention of
this in the post-mortem.

1639
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:12,460
Ofcourse not, Your Honour.
Ofcourse not.

1640
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:17,250
But we would like to know why these
things had been written in the papers.

1641
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:19,000
That's all we would like to know.

1642
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:21,000
Your Honour, I would like
your permission to...

1643
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:24,090
...call Mr.Satyajit Sanyal
to the witness box.

1644
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:28,670
How are you, Mr.Sanyal?
- I'm well.

1645
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,090
Good.

1646
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,710
Please tell the court, how long after the
time of death does rigor mortis set in?

1647
01:44:37,710 --> 01:44:41,340
It starts off about an
hour or two after death.

1648
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:47,130
And it spreads to the entire
body in about 4 hours.

1649
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:53,300
According to the newspapers Hema
Parekh's hands and legs had been broken...

1650
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:56,880
...although nothing of the sort
is mentioned in the post-mortem.

1651
01:44:56,920 --> 01:45:00,090
But the reporters had definitely seen that
her hands and legs were bent.

1652
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:01,550
Why was this?

1653
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,800
Due to rigor mortis, Your Honour.

1654
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:06,670
And according to what
Mr.Satyajit Sanyal said...

1655
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:10,460
...if Rigor Mortis
had spread by 7PM...

1656
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:14,170
...then the time of death would
be somewhere between 2:30PM-3:30PM

1657
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:18,460
Now let us see what the
undigested food is telling us.

1658
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,420
According to Dhanyaram's statement...

1659
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,710
...Hema Parekh returned
home at around 2PM

1660
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,960
She had most probably
eaten at around that time.

1661
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:30,420
So then the undigested food suggests that
she died somewhere between 2:30-3:30PM

1662
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:33,250
What is this Your Honour?
It is a made up story.

1663
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,590
My dear learned friend,
I am not saying this.

1664
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:37,710
Science is.

1665
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,130
If science was given
importance 18 years ago...

1666
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,380
...we wouldn't be
fighting this case today.

1667
01:45:43,590 --> 01:45:47,500
The PM report contained much more
than circumstantial evidence...

1668
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:52,800
...because the undigested food would have
allowed for an accurate estimate of the time of death.

1669
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:56,710
If the victim had been killed by 4PM,
then she could not have been raped.

1670
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:59,800
Because Survi Parekh was
inside the house at that time.

1671
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,170
Objection, My Lord!

1672
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:04,670
Hema Parekh had signs of injury
all over her body aswell as a ruptured hymen.

1673
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:08,460
My friend, you are combining
two separate incidents.

1674
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:11,710
One is murder and the other
is sexual intercourse.

1675
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,710
My hunch is that Hema Parekh had
had sex with her lover.

1676
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:19,170
Which may be proved by
the 21 injuries on her body.

1677
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:23,340
With your permission I would
like to use the display board.

1678
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:26,130
21 injuries in total, My Lord.

1679
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:30,050
Maximum injuries are
around the face and neck.

1680
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,340
2 injuries on the waist
and the elbow.

1681
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:38,050
There are bruises and cuts from
scratches and punches to the face.

1682
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:43,380
At the end, Hema Parekh
died because her Hyoid bone broke.

1683
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:47,210
Reflection of anger, Your Honour.

1684
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:49,420
But why such anger?

1685
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:55,630
We would request forensic expert
Kumod Basu to approach the witness box.

1686
01:46:56,050 --> 01:46:57,880
Granted.

1687
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,710
Mr.Kumod Basu...
- Yes?

1688
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:02,920
There was no semen on
Hema Parekh's pubic hair.

1689
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:05,960
But there was semen on
the floor and on her clothes.

1690
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:08,170
Her vaginal swab-
- No.

1691
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:09,630
It did not contain any trace.

1692
01:47:09,710 --> 01:47:12,130
...there was sexual intercourse, Your Honour.

1693
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,590
Thank you. You might go now.

1694
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:17,630
Ofcourse there was an
intercourse, Your Honour.

1695
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:21,840
But it was a
consensual intercourse.

1696
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:25,920
They both wanted it to happen.

1697
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:29,250
Because we have never
seen a rape case where...

1698
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:32,710
...there are signs of injury
to the upper half of the body but...

1699
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,300
...but none to the lower half.

1700
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:37,170
But then, who killed her?

1701
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:38,670
We don't know.

1702
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:41,590
Because at that time there were
only 2 people inside the house.

1703
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:44,670
Hema Parekh and her
mother Survi Parekh.

1704
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:48,500
The 18 year old Hema Parekh did not
return home directly from school.

1705
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:51,250
This is what we may conclude
from Dhanyaram's statement.

1706
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:53,000
So, where had she gone?

1707
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:56,170
Did she have a boyfriend?
Did she go to meet him?

1708
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,210
Did she have physical
relations with him?

1709
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:01,130
We don't know a thing.

1710
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:04,590
Did Hema Parekh return home after 2?
We don't know.

1711
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
When Hema Parekh was changing
out of her school uniform...

1712
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:10,670
...Survi Parekh became suspiscious.

1713
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:14,340
Then she got angry, started
hitting her and accidentally...

1714
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,550
...broke her hyoid bone.
Which led to her death.

1715
01:48:18,670 --> 01:48:22,550
Impossible, Sir! I can find
nothing to support this absurd theory.

1716
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,380
Your Lordship...

1717
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:26,460
...the suspiscion grows...

1718
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:29,960
...when we see that the mother
when faced with her daughter's corpse...

1719
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:36,090
...searches the entire flat for Dhananjoy instead
of trying to get her daughter to a hospital.

1720
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:38,710
Where is Dhananjoy?
Dhananjoy!

1721
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:41,420
The suspiscion grows stronger when...

1722
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:45,210
...we see that the servant of the house,
Rakesh had never been called to be a witness.

1723
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:50,420
If Rakesh had been called we may have got
an insight into the dynamics of the Parekh family.

1724
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,500
We may have found out about the relationship
between mother and daughter.

1725
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:54,880
But this never happened!

1726
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:57,710
After the murder, the Parekh family...

1727
01:48:58,170 --> 01:49:01,050
...left their locality,
closed down their business,

1728
01:49:01,130 --> 01:49:04,090
took their son out of college
and moved to Mumbai.

1729
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,630
Why is that?

1730
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:10,750
Why is it that Survi Parekh's statement
about the time of the incident...

1731
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:13,050
...doesn't concur with that of the police.

1732
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:18,250
Doesn't this prove that those witnesses who
may have posed a threat to the Parekh family...

1733
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,670
...were never called.

1734
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:21,670
Rakesh.

1735
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:22,500
Murmu.

1736
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:23,380
Lolita Bagchi.

1737
01:49:23,550 --> 01:49:24,000
Hari.

1738
01:49:24,170 --> 01:49:24,630
Tandon.

1739
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,670
None of them!

1740
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:29,050
If this makes us suspiscious...

1741
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:31,460
...is that suspiscion
not well founded?

1742
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:34,840
I would ask the representatives
of the state...

1743
01:49:35,050 --> 01:49:41,500
...to prepare answers to these
questions on the next date.

1744
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:47,880
So that we may discuss
these issues in detail.

1745
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,840
My boy left me.

1746
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:00,800
In an effort to get my
daughter's married...

1747
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:03,880
...I lost everything.

1748
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:06,880
My house, my land...

1749
01:50:08,090 --> 01:50:10,340
...I lost it all.

1750
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:13,340
Many people had assured me...

1751
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:16,750
...that they would save my son.

1752
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,130
But none could.

1753
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:23,460
I didn't have the money...

1754
01:50:24,210 --> 01:50:29,000
...to hire a big lawyer.

1755
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:35,960
Everyone turned away from me.

1756
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:40,130
What do you think?

1757
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:43,960
Think your son could have done it?
- Never!

1758
01:50:44,050 --> 01:50:45,460
Never!

1759
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:49,050
I am a Brahmin.

1760
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:51,130
I believe in God.

1761
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:57,500
And these people killed my son.

1762
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:59,880
Oh God!

1763
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:01,670
Sit down.

1764
01:51:01,710 --> 01:51:02,800
Get some water!

1765
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:04,800
This happens everyday.

1766
01:51:07,170 --> 01:51:09,130
All the time...

1767
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:15,960
This is just how things are.

1768
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:20,710
It just destroyed me.

1769
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:24,090
I am finished.

1770
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:26,880
This is how the rich
people in our country...

1771
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:31,800
...kill the ones who are poor.

1772
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:34,590
They suck the life out of you.

1773
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:40,090
When the rich people
combine forces...

1774
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:43,840
...the poor never stand a chance.

1775
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:46,840
Only depravation.

1776
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:59,130
Your Honour, for the last 2 days in court,
the defendantas have described a fictional thriller.

1777
01:51:59,710 --> 01:52:04,670
The judges of 3 courts, including
the Supreme Court of India...

1778
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:08,300
...have gone through all the testimonies
and then come to this verdict.

1779
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:12,170
And they have also mentioned
that this is a very rare case.

1780
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:18,210
A security guard, is one who is responsible
for the lives of the residents.

1781
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:24,500
So when he, the protector, kills someone,
it is a most heinous crime.

1782
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:29,800
1984, in the case of ex-primeminister,
Indira Gandhi's murder,

1783
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:32,250
the court used these very
words.

1784
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:35,460
Security guard, Dhananjoy Chatterjee...

1785
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:39,590
...did not have a sound alibi.

1786
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:44,630
He had not been able to produce the ticket
for the film he had claimed to have watched.

1787
01:52:44,630 --> 01:52:52,000
He had not been able to prove that he was
not around that house at 5:30PM

1788
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:55,800
On the contrary, evidence linking him
to the crime were found at his house.

1789
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,800
His motives were made so clear...

1790
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:03,090
...that there could be no doubt about
the fact that he committed the crime.

1791
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:06,050
4 years after the execution...

1792
01:53:06,170 --> 01:53:11,300
...we are sitting in court and telling stories
which lack any factual premise.

1793
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:17,630
Dhananjoy Chatterjee has written everything
very explicitly in his final testimony.

1794
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:21,630
What further proof can be required?

1795
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:23,750
That's all, Your Honour.

1796
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,630
Miss Kavya Sinha...

1797
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:31,420
Your Honour,

1798
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:37,090
any and every testimony should be
cross-examined to ascertain its validity.

1799
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:43,590
Especially when the testimony and the
chain of events leading up to the crime have no link.

1800
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:46,130
So, let us examine...

1801
01:53:46,170 --> 01:53:47,630
Hema Parekh was murdered.

1802
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:49,340
Survi Parekh returned home.

1803
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:52,670
She banged on the door.
And when she got no response...

1804
01:53:52,710 --> 01:53:54,630
...she got people to
break down the door and...

1805
01:53:54,630 --> 01:53:57,630
...every person saw the body
lying in a different position.

1806
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:59,840
This is not a proper argument.

1807
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:05,380
The body was found. The trauma may cause
a person to forget exactly where it was.

1808
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:09,630
Your Honour, I would like to call
Mr.Satish Pandey to the witness box.

1809
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:11,880
Satish Pandey.
- A little louder?

1810
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,130
Satish Pandey!

1811
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:13,750
Ok.

1812
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:19,380
I shall read your testimony
from the night of the murder. Ok?

1813
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:25,210
Let's see.

1814
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:31,090
You returned home with
your family at around 6PM

1815
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:36,300
10-15 minutes after that you heard banging
on the Parekh's door and you ran down.

1816
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:39,630
You saw that the door
was being broken and once inside...

1817
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:41,880
...you saw Hema Parekh's dead body.
Am I right?

1818
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:43,590
Yes.
- Hmm.

1819
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:49,340
Survi Parekh stated that she had
seen Hema Parekh's corpse at 6:05PM

1820
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:55,630
And Mr.Satish Pandey is saying that the door was
being broken at atleast 15 minutes after 6PM.

1821
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:58,340
It was only after that
that the body was seen.

1822
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:01,050
The testimonies are
contradicting each other.

1823
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,130
At what time do you
normally return home?

1824
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:07,500
Somewhere between 7 and 8PM

1825
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:09,300
Why did you return
early on that day?

1826
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:13,960
I didn't have much work on that day and I
had planned to go out with my family.

1827
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:15,880
Your Honour,

1828
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:20,420
the liftman Dhanyaram stated that he
saw no one going up between 5-6PM...

1829
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:23,960
...except Mrs. Parekh and Karuna.

1830
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:26,710
I don't know anything about this.

1831
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:30,800
What was the state of Hema Parekh's
body when you saw it?

1832
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,670
She was lying on the floor.

1833
01:55:33,250 --> 01:55:35,250
Were any sensitive regions
of the body exposed?

1834
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:36,670
Yes.

1835
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:41,170
The lower half of her body
was completely naked.

1836
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:44,210
I could not bare the sight.
So I left.

1837
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:46,380
Yes, yes, I understand.
Must be terrible.

1838
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:51,460
You haven't said anything about the clothes
Hema was wearing on the upper half of her body.

1839
01:55:51,590 --> 01:55:53,210
Does that mean it was intact?

1840
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:55,550
That's what your
testimony tells us.

1841
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,500
Your Lordship...

1842
01:55:58,130 --> 01:56:02,250
Mrs.Parekh and Mr.Pandey's testimony on
the position of the body...

1843
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:04,420
...are in accordance with each other.

1844
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,500
That's ok. That's fine.
But what about the appearance of the deceased?

1845
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,460
Survi Parekh had said to the police, in her
testimony that Hema was lying on her chest.

1846
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:16,550
Her upper body was exposed...

1847
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:21,420
Her skirt was pulled up. So you could see a
naked upper and lower body.

1848
01:56:21,670 --> 01:56:25,250
Now we will see what the
post-mortem report says.

1849
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,590
The post-mortem report says...

1850
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:34,550
External appearance: Wearing apparel - 1 dark
coloured half sleeve t-shirt,

1851
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:37,630
with evidence of recent
tear around the neck...

1852
01:56:37,710 --> 01:56:39,000
...and a brasier.

1853
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:41,340
I'm confused, Your Honour.

1854
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:43,590
My dear learned friend is confused.

1855
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:46,420
He is wildly combing
through his papers.

1856
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:49,710
The post-mortem report
contradicts Survi Parekh's report.

1857
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:53,090
Which proves that she wasn't raped.
Thank you so much. You may go.

1858
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:59,630
All the witnesses are saying that her
body was exposed to some extent.

1859
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:01,880
My dear learned friend...

1860
01:57:02,210 --> 01:57:04,130
...the body could not
have been exposed.

1861
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:08,170
Try and understand. If the daughter's body
was so erroneously exposed, no mother...

1862
01:57:08,210 --> 01:57:09,960
...would carry her
downstairs in that state.

1863
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,590
Which proves that she
had her clothes on.

1864
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:16,250
It's very strange, Your Honour.

1865
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:20,090
Satish Pandey's testimony did not
correspond with that of Survi Parekh.

1866
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:23,340
Dhanyaram's testimony does not
correspond with that of Survi Parekh.

1867
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:27,420
Whereas everyone was present
at the same point of occurence.

1868
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:31,710
So how can we accept
circumstantial evidence?

1869
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,250
Your Honour...

1870
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:36,500
...the law works on the
basis of police reports.

1871
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:38,590
Not on the basis of stories.

1872
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:40,750
If that is the case,
my dear learned friend,

1873
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:46,920
then why does the inquest report only talk
about the upper half of Hema Parekh's body?

1874
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:53,340
Because I believe that the police never
even took the white cloth off her corpse.

1875
01:57:56,590 --> 01:58:00,170
We know that documented
evidence does speak volumes.

1876
01:58:00,590 --> 01:58:05,130
If Dhananjoy was not guilty then
why would he have fled for so long?

1877
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:09,300
And how would the police have recovered
the stolen Rico watch and the shirt from his house?

1878
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:11,500
Objection, Your Honour.

1879
01:58:12,130 --> 01:58:14,090
Sustained.

1880
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:15,880
Thank you.

1881
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:21,840
Dhananjoy had explained things in detail,
in his statement to the police.

1882
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,500
He had explained every detail
of the murder aswell as his exit plan.

1883
01:58:25,590 --> 01:58:30,300
He had also kept the shirt that he was
wearing on the day of the murder very carefully.

1884
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:33,840
He had kept it for 3 months.
So that the police may find it.

1885
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:39,210
And the police did recover these things,
from a shelf in Dhananjoy's house.

1886
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:41,750
This is also mentioned
in the testimony.

1887
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:44,050
But there is a problem.

1888
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:49,170
Dhananjoy's brother, Prakash has informed
us, and we have also inspected for ourselves...

1889
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:51,380
...that there are no shelves
in Dhananjoy's house.

1890
01:58:52,050 --> 01:58:54,380
I have nothing to say to
this, Your Honour.

1891
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:56,050
Don't give up now.

1892
01:58:56,250 --> 01:59:00,670
With the permission of the Court,
we would like to call to the witness box,

1893
01:59:00,670 --> 01:59:03,500
the OC of the Chatna police station,
at the time; Prabahat Chatterjee.

1894
01:59:06,590 --> 01:59:08,420
So, Prabhat Babu...

1895
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:11,300
...where did you arrest
Dhananjoy Chatterjee from?

1896
01:59:12,210 --> 01:59:13,750
From his uncle's house.

1897
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:16,670
No, no. Where exactly
in his uncle's house?

1898
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:19,380
From the hay...
- The hay?

1899
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:22,800
I mean the thatched roof.

1900
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:27,880
Yes...
- He was lying under the thatched roof in the verandah.

1901
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,300
Ok, so let me repeat it.

1902
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:35,880
The thatched roof in the verandah.
- Yes.

1903
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:38,750
You found him lying down?
- Yes, he was lying down.

1904
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,750
Thank you so much. You may go.

1905
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:43,250
Your Honour,

1906
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:46,380
apart from Prabhat Chatterjee,
there were two very important witnesses...

1907
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:48,920
...who were a part of the team
that arrested Dhananjoy.

1908
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,670
The first is Mr.Debashish Deb Sharma.

1909
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:56,210
Let's go! You need to
sign the seizure list.

1910
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:01,130
I would like to cross-examine him with
your permission, Your Honour?

1911
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:02,750
Proceed.

1912
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:05,380
How are you doing?
- I'm fine.

1913
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:08,050
Please do tell the court...

1914
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:11,670
...as a member of the team
that arrested Dhananjoy...

1915
02:00:11,710 --> 02:00:12,210
Yes.

1916
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:15,500
...where was Dhananjoy arrested from?

1917
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:18,130
He was hiding behind the haystack.

1918
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:20,960
Thank you.
You may go.

1919
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:25,250
...2 people from the same team are
giving contradictory testimonies.

1920
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:31,840
Prabhat Chatterjee says that Dhananjoy was
lying under the thatched roof in the verandah.

1921
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:34,920
And Debashish Babu says that
he was hiding behind a haystack.

1922
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,130
This proves...

1923
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,300
...that the 2 teams
weren't in sync.

1924
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:41,960
There was a certain
miscommunication sowehere.

1925
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,500
Because Prabhat Chatterjee
in his testimony at the time,

1926
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:48,460
mentioned that he was speaking
on the basis of his memory.

1927
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,300
Becasue after Dhananjoy was arrested...

1928
02:00:51,590 --> 02:00:55,920
...there was no communication between
Lalbazar and Chatna police station.

1929
02:00:56,210 --> 02:00:59,500
Chatna police station had the memories and
Lalbazar had the documents.

1930
02:00:59,670 --> 02:01:01,250
Objection, your Honour!

1931
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:04,500
What is he raising a finger at?
- Umpire's raise finger's, sir.

1932
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:06,500
When there is an appeal against the batsman,

1933
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:08,630
umpire's analyse the situation
and raise a finger if he's out.

1934
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:13,250
Even the batsman in a cricket match is given
the benefit of doubt, Your Honour.

1935
02:01:14,130 --> 02:01:18,250
And in a case like this,
involving a suspect like this,

1936
02:01:18,710 --> 02:01:21,130
where there are so many contradictions...

1937
02:01:21,210 --> 02:01:23,380
...the accused was never given
the benefit of the doubt. Why?

1938
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:24,750
Who was being protected?

1939
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:27,300
He was being framed for
someone else's crime.

1940
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:30,250
What about the watch,
button and chain?

1941
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:33,170
They had been recovered
from the accused.

1942
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:35,170
These are pieces of evidence.

1943
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:37,800
Let's say that I am the accused.

1944
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:42,130
In my absence some things were taken from
my house and since I am accused,

1945
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:44,750
all of these things must belong to me.

1946
02:01:45,210 --> 02:01:47,050
And-
- Your Honour...

1947
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:48,630
...we are wasting time.

1948
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:50,750
We are not wasting time, my friend.

1949
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:53,090
It's just that I have my doubts.

1950
02:01:54,050 --> 02:01:59,340
So, Dhananjoy Chatterjee kept the watch
that he had stolen for 3 months after the crime?

1951
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:05,590
He went to Rourkela from Kolkata and
then moved to Bankura. Why did he keep it?

1952
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:08,340
Was he waiting for the police
to come and arrest him?

1953
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,130
Strange.

1954
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:15,590
And in his grief Nishant Parekh
became a detective.

1955
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:21,300
Many people had come to
that flat between 6-9:15PM

1956
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:24,840
But no one spotted
that button and chain.

1957
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,840
They didn't even call the police.
That's very strange.

1958
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:31,550
So much happened in that time.

1959
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,340
Nimai Babu...

1960
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:40,250
...Hemang informed you that
the chain belonged to Hari?

1961
02:02:40,710 --> 02:02:41,670
Yes.

1962
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:44,170
Had you interrogated Hari?

1963
02:02:44,590 --> 02:02:46,750
Yes. He said...

1964
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,710
...that he had given
the chain to Dhananjoy.

1965
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:50,300
When?
- Hmm?

1966
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:54,210
I don't remember the date.
- He couldn't say.

1967
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:57,300
Where had he
bought the chain from?

1968
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,050
He couldn't say that either.

1969
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:04,920
Had anyone seen Hari
giving the chain to Dhananjoy?

1970
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:06,920
No.

1971
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:11,300
So, how could you be sure
that Hari had given the chain to Dhananjoy?

1972
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:17,210
No, actually...we were on
the hunt for Dhananjoy then.

1973
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:18,340
Exactly, Your Honour.

1974
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:22,170
On the 5th of March because Hari had said
that he had given the chain to Dhananjoy...

1975
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:24,000
...everyone believed it.

1976
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:28,670
But if Hari had said any
name other than Dhananjoy, like...

1977
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:33,550
...Rakesh or Paachu. Would
you have believed that too?

1978
02:03:33,670 --> 02:03:36,130
Or would you have
investigated the matter?

1979
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:39,050
No, that's not it.

1980
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:41,380
Everyone in the family...
- Exactly!

1981
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:42,920
Everyone in the family.

1982
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,670
From 6-9:30PM they tried
to figure out who they could blame...

1983
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:49,750
...and they selected Dhananjoy Chatterjee.
Am I right?

1984
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:51,000
Objection, My Lord!

1985
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:57,840
We have no proof to suggest that the
Parekh family framed Dhananjoy.

1986
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:00,050
Sustained.

1987
02:04:00,130 --> 02:04:02,460
You can't say things like that.

1988
02:04:04,630 --> 02:04:08,550
You were the chief investigating
officer on the case. Am I right?

1989
02:04:08,590 --> 02:04:10,750
Until the case was handed
over to the Detective Department.

1990
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:11,340
Yes.

1991
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:16,170
You claim to have written the testimonies
of the main witnesses that night, in your own hand.

1992
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:17,840
Yes.

1993
02:04:18,090 --> 02:04:23,170
But 2 police officers have said that when
they were on their way to Hema's house...

1994
02:04:23,210 --> 02:04:26,250
...they saw you standing
below Sunananda Apartments.

1995
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:29,880
You had apparently shown
them the way to Hema's flat.

1996
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:35,460
In your testimony you stated that you had not
taken the testimony of anyone on the ground floor.

1997
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:41,050
Your signature is on the witness and seizure list.
Are you not aware of these signatures?

1998
02:04:41,170 --> 02:04:46,050
My goodness! Why would the Parekh family
want to frame Dhananjoy?

1999
02:04:46,210 --> 02:04:48,210
That's what I am
not understanding.

2000
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:52,250
When a mother opens a door and sees
her daughter's corpse lying on the floor...

2001
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:54,840
...she is likely to have a heart attack.

2002
02:04:54,880 --> 02:05:01,000
But Mrs.Parekh left her daughter on the floor
and ran about the flat looking for Dhananjoy. Dhanan-

2003
02:05:01,090 --> 02:05:06,590
Ms.Sinha. You cannot accuse a person
who has been so overcome by grief.

2004
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:08,420
Mr.Kar...

2005
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,750
...look there. Another person
overcome by grief.

2006
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:16,000
A woman whose husband was sentenced
to death in front of her eyes.

2007
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:20,210
My consience made it difficult
for me to look her in the eye.

2008
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:25,550
A lot of evidence that never existed has been
arranged to convict someone.

2009
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:29,670
The button, the clothes,

2010
02:05:31,630 --> 02:05:34,340
and that Rico watch.

2011
02:05:35,050 --> 02:05:36,300
Thank you.

2012
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:42,920
So, Dhananjoy Chatterjee wrapped the clothes
he had worn at the time of the murder in a newspaper,

2013
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:46,250
and left it at his home so that
the police could come and find it.

2014
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:47,750
Good.

2015
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,590
Now let's come to the button.

2016
02:05:50,710 --> 02:05:54,460
On the 6th of March, 1990...

2017
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:57,590
...all evidence was sent to forensics.

2018
02:05:57,880 --> 02:06:03,210
But the button reached forensics
on 28th May, 1990

2019
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:04,800
Again, that delay.

2020
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:06,800
Why so late ?

2021
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:14,960
Are we sure that on the 12th of May, 1990, when
the police arrested Dhananjoy and seized his clothes...

2022
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:18,380
...they did not tear the button
and send it to forensics?

2023
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:21,300
Your Honour, I strongly protest
against this statement!

2024
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:23,800
The essence of time
does protest aswell.

2025
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:31,460
Your Honour, Debashish Deb Sharma and Nandan Babu
signed on the seizure list in Dhananjoy's house.

2026
02:06:31,630 --> 02:06:34,880
I would like to call Debashish Deb Sharma
to the witness box.

2027
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:35,920
Proceed.

2028
02:06:39,130 --> 02:06:42,840
We have a tea-shop opposite
Chatna police station.

2029
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:45,250
The cops drink tea from there.

2030
02:06:45,460 --> 02:06:49,250
On the 13th of May, 1990,
I was on my way to deliver some tea...

2031
02:06:49,550 --> 02:06:50,670
... when I saw Dhana sitting there.

2032
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:51,630
Here you go.

2033
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:55,550
So, the cycle was stolen
from behind your house?

2034
02:06:55,710 --> 02:06:56,670
Yes, sir.

2035
02:06:57,380 --> 02:07:00,000
Dhana? What are you doing here?

2036
02:07:00,210 --> 02:07:02,170
What did you do?
Who beat you up?

2037
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:03,550
Hey there!
- Yes?

2038
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:04,880
Do you know him?

2039
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:06,920
Yes, sir. That's Dhana.

2040
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:08,130
We studied in the same school.

2041
02:07:08,210 --> 02:07:10,210
Come inside. Come along!

2042
02:07:13,670 --> 02:07:17,550
Then the police made me
sign on a blank sheet of paper.

2043
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:20,000
Your Honour, this is the seizure list.

2044
02:07:20,170 --> 02:07:24,880
Which means that Debashish Babu wasn't
at Dhananjoy's uncle's house at the time of arrest.

2045
02:07:25,550 --> 02:07:29,300
Now we know why Debashish Babu's
testimony doesn't match...

2046
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:32,590
...that of the officer
from Chatna police station.

2047
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:36,340
This is why their accounts
of the exact location...

2048
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:39,170
...of Dhananjoy's arrest contradicted
one another.

2049
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:41,210
Another interesting fact...

2050
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:47,000
Debashish Babu was kept like a king for
3 days in the house of Sunil Basu Mullick.

2051
02:07:47,090 --> 02:07:49,750
He was fed a feast everyday,
he watched movies and...

2052
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:51,920
...stayed in an air-conditioned room.
Isn't that so, Debashish Babu?

2053
02:07:52,050 --> 02:07:57,840
Yes, My Lord. They had taken me from my home
and kept me in Sunil Babu's house for 3 days.

2054
02:07:58,170 --> 02:07:59,590
Then I gave my testimony.

2055
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:01,920
Everything has been taken care of.
Don't worry about a thing.

2056
02:08:02,090 --> 02:08:03,250
Hmm.
- Hmm.

2057
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,000
Get in.

2058
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:06,880
This is completely made up.

2059
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:11,050
Then why did 2 witnesses testify that they
had seen the seizure list before signing it.

2060
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:14,750
Your Lordship, in order to
ascertain whether this story is fictional...

2061
02:08:15,130 --> 02:08:20,630
...I would like to call upon the OC of Chatna
police station, at the time, Mr.Prabhat Chatterjee.

2062
02:08:22,340 --> 02:08:27,250
Had you made the seizure list
at the time of Dhananjoy's arrest?

2063
02:08:29,050 --> 02:08:31,050
No.
- You didn't?

2064
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:37,630
An officer had made the list.
I had merely signed on it.

2065
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:40,750
So you would have signed
it even if the button was an ink pen?

2066
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:42,460
I am surprised, Your Honour.

2067
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:46,050
Not one person from
Kolkata to Bankura knows...

2068
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:49,250
...what is in which list!

2069
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:51,210
Everyone just keeps
signing things!

2070
02:08:51,590 --> 02:08:56,050
And last but not least the
elusive item that Dhananjoy had stolen...

2071
02:08:56,710 --> 02:08:59,840
A watch was stolen
from our almirah.

2072
02:09:00,130 --> 02:09:01,710
A ladies watch, from Rico.

2073
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:04,300
Oh.
- Dhananjoy has stolen it.

2074
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:07,050
This is our written complaint.

2075
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:08,420
Yes...

2076
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,420
...that's what I was thinking.

2077
02:09:10,670 --> 02:09:14,380
Why would he go through the
almirah and not steal anything?

2078
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:16,420
Exactly, Your Lordship.

2079
02:09:16,590 --> 02:09:20,590
How could he have gone through
the almirah and not stolen anything?

2080
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:23,130
The whole incident
would have seemed fake.

2081
02:09:23,250 --> 02:09:26,590
And that's why the Rico watch
story was made up.

2082
02:09:26,670 --> 02:09:31,170
The watch was bought by the Parekh family
from a store in Rajabazar on the 21st of February.

2083
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:34,750
They had submitted a
guarantee card but no cash memo.

2084
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:37,630
So what? That watch was recovered.

2085
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,880
It was recovered Your Honour.

2086
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:43,550
But how did Mrs.Parekh know
that it was indeed her wrist watch?

2087
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:45,960
Did she match the serial number?
No she didn't.

2088
02:09:46,050 --> 02:09:49,590
If she had, then the 2 watches may have
been proved to be completely different.

2089
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:54,500
Actually this was staged in order to lend
credibilty to the almirah ruffling claim.

2090
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:59,670
If we are to make up stories then the
prosecution can also have a lot to say.

2091
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:00,630
No, they can't say a thing.

2092
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:03,340
The prosecution can't
write any new stories.

2093
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:07,460
I'm sorry to say. All your stories have
been published in the last edition.

2094
02:10:08,050 --> 02:10:11,920
The Parekh family understood that
if the serial number came up...

2095
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:15,340
...it would give birth to a
number of questions.

2096
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:20,670
And when they understood it, they tried
to get the watch back into their custody.

2097
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:22,380
But they couldn't.

2098
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:25,130
It's very fishy, Your Honour.

2099
02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:33,800
Mr.Chowdhury, after all this, I still see no reason
for Dhananjoy to have stayed in hiding.

2100
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:36,000
Kavya...

2101
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:39,630
Fear, Your Honour.

2102
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:43,000
Fear that had been
instilled in to Dhananjoy.

2103
02:10:43,710 --> 02:10:46,920
I would like to call the
investigating officer at the time,

2104
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:49,170
Sunil Basu Mullick to the witness box.

2105
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:55,590
In his testimony,
Debashish Babu has said...

2106
02:10:55,840 --> 02:11:02,880
...that at the time of the trial, he lived like
a king in your house. Is that right?

2107
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:06,800
I don't know.

2108
02:11:07,050 --> 02:11:10,170
When did you start
searching for Dhananjoy?

2109
02:11:10,170 --> 02:11:13,460
Also, where did you look?

2110
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:19,800
Your Honour, we started searching for him
in various places all around Kolkata.

2111
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:24,210
We found some letters
at Binapani School aswell.

2112
02:11:24,340 --> 02:11:26,800
That made us suspiscious...

2113
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:28,340
...and so we left for Bankura.

2114
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:30,090
Durgapur?
- Hmm?

2115
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:33,210
Oh yes. We went to
Durgapur aswell.

2116
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:36,250
How did you find
out about Durgapur?

2117
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:40,630
Your Honour, it's been so long-
-You don't remember?

2118
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:41,800
You don't remember.
- Ya...

2119
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:44,380
Exactly! So should I remind you?
- Hmm?

2120
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:48,670
You found a few of Dhananjoy's
letters at Binapani school...

2121
02:11:48,670 --> 02:11:52,800
...on the basis of which
you set out for Durgapur. Correct?

2122
02:11:54,420 --> 02:11:55,670
Yes.

2123
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:57,250
Right. So...

2124
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:59,710
Whose letters were they?

2125
02:12:01,130 --> 02:12:03,630
Probably Dhananjoy's elder brother's.

2126
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:06,590
But you didn't go to Dhananjoy's
brother's house in Durgapur.

2127
02:12:06,670 --> 02:12:08,960
You just went there
and came back.

2128
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,670
Because you didn't have
Dhananjoy's brother's address.

2129
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:13,670
Am I right?

2130
02:12:13,750 --> 02:12:18,550
And if they had no address, it is safe
to assume that there were no letters.

2131
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:20,710
We got news from
another source.

2132
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:23,250
Exactly! I want to know
what was the source?

2133
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:25,590
Parekh family?
- Objection My Lord!

2134
02:12:25,710 --> 02:12:29,130
Ms. Sinha, what are you implying?

2135
02:12:30,130 --> 02:12:31,960
It's my own conjecture.

2136
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,550
I don't know whether I shall
ever be able to prove it.

2137
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:36,590
Thank you.

2138
02:12:39,130 --> 02:12:42,590
You will find the name
Mujammal Haq in the witness list.

2139
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:48,000
Mujammal Haq is the person who had
given Dhananjoy his transfer order.

2140
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:53,210
If we go by what Dhananjoy's
younger brother Prakash has said...

2141
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:58,710
...then Shibu and Mujammal forced
Dhananjoy to get into a car and leave Kolkata,

2142
02:12:58,710 --> 02:13:02,960
although Dhananjoy wanted to go
to the scene of the crime...

2143
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:05,710
...when he found out
about Hema's death.

2144
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:07,750
Objection, My Lord!

2145
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:11,300
If we start believing such absurd theories
then there can be no end to it.

2146
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:15,670
We should then reopen
all cases and free every criminal.

2147
02:13:16,250 --> 02:13:17,960
Your Lordship...

2148
02:13:18,210 --> 02:13:21,750
...my learned friend said
that with such ease, didn't he?

2149
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:26,550
There is a world
outside this courtroom.

2150
02:13:26,670 --> 02:13:29,090
Where the two of us are just men.

2151
02:13:29,710 --> 02:13:31,750
A man has died.

2152
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,800
So how can the Honourable Court
not investigate the matter?

2153
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:39,250
Mujammal Haq must be
produced at court tomorrow.

2154
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:41,670
Court is adjourned till tomorrow.

2155
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:48,250
Haq Babu, did you meet
Dhananjoy that night?

2156
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:50,130
No.

2157
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:53,920
Had you and Shibu
told Dhananjoy to run?

2158
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:55,750
No.

2159
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:58,500
Did you hand over Dhananjoy's
transfer letter to him?

2160
02:13:58,670 --> 02:13:59,550
No.

2161
02:13:59,750 --> 02:14:00,880
No?

2162
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:05,710
Yes, Sir. I had given
Dhana the transfer letter.

2163
02:14:06,170 --> 02:14:08,460
Hmm. So that was just a slip of tongue...

2164
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,460
Who sent the car?
Hema Parekh's family?

2165
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:13,250
Ms.Sinha...

2166
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:18,380
...you can't make such claims
based merely on conjecture.

2167
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:23,340
Your Honour, on the basis of the
judgement of 3 courts, the decision was taken.

2168
02:14:23,630 --> 02:14:26,840
But none of the
evidence is conclusive.

2169
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:31,800
Even the results of the serological tests
are inconclusive. You can take a look.

2170
02:14:32,170 --> 02:14:34,750
The size of the chain found at the
scene of the crime was varied too.

2171
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:40,800
One lab said it was 22 inches
and the other said it was 18 inches.

2172
02:14:41,550 --> 02:14:45,090
The blood soaked newspaper
that was sent to the forensic lab...

2173
02:14:45,250 --> 02:14:48,300
...had become a sponge by
the time it reached the lab.

2174
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:51,500
Sniffer dogs were given a blood -
soaked handkerchief to work with.

2175
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:54,300
That same handkerchief was
later found soaked with water.

2176
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:58,380
The serological report stated: 'No comments.'

2177
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:04,250
In the case of rape we normally find
male pubic hair on the body of the female.

2178
02:15:04,340 --> 02:15:08,250
In this case Dhananjoy's
pubic hair samples were taken but...

2179
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:12,590
...the report mentioned that they had
'No further comments' on the matter.

2180
02:15:12,750 --> 02:15:14,800
Your Lordship,

2181
02:15:15,130 --> 02:15:19,050
this is undoubtedly
a rarest of rare case.

2182
02:15:20,170 --> 02:15:24,300
We may not be able
to prove a thing.

2183
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:28,960
But we want to know,
our consience wants to know...

2184
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:31,460
...what had really happened?

2185
02:15:31,710 --> 02:15:33,920
Go on, Mr.Chowdhury.

2186
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:40,670
Hema Parekh had returned from school,
after her exam on the 5th of March, 1990.

2187
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:46,840
Now, we have conceived
a theory about that day...

2188
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:51,550
...which might simply be a conjecture
or it may even be the truth.

2189
02:15:51,630 --> 02:15:56,750
And in this case, Dhanyaram
is our most important witness.

2190
02:15:56,920 --> 02:16:00,960
Because he was the one,
who most definitively said...

2191
02:16:01,090 --> 02:16:03,670
...that Hema Parekh had
not retuned at 1PM

2192
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:08,250
But had infact returned at 2PM

2193
02:16:12,170 --> 02:16:15,500
Why so late?
- Traffic jam.

2194
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:21,590
How was your exam?
- Good.

2195
02:16:57,090 --> 02:16:58,750
What is this?

2196
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:00,880
What is what?

2197
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:04,710
That's what I want to know!
Tell me?

2198
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:07,880
What is this?

2199
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:09,130
Where were you?

2200
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:12,670
I was stuck in a traffic jam.

2201
02:17:13,630 --> 02:17:15,420
Don't lie to me!

2202
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:17,300
Tell me where you were?

2203
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:21,210
What shameful things
have you been up to?

2204
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:23,250
Where were you?

2205
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:25,710
Tell me!

2206
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:27,960
I had gone to a friend's place.

2207
02:17:28,050 --> 02:17:31,170
Friend! Which friend?

2208
02:17:31,170 --> 02:17:33,630
Where had you gone?

2209
02:17:33,670 --> 02:17:35,750
Did you ever think about us?

2210
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:39,000
Did you ?...

2211
02:17:39,130 --> 02:17:41,050
You brainless skank!

2212
02:17:41,170 --> 02:17:44,380
Did you ever think what
would happen to us?

2213
02:17:45,090 --> 02:17:48,340
Did you never think
about your family?

2214
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:51,710
Why didn't you die?

2215
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:53,710
Why didn't you die?

2216
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:58,130
Die!

2217
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:00,880
Why didn't you die?

2218
02:18:01,130 --> 02:18:04,340
Why didn't you die?

2219
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:17,210
Hema?

2220
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:20,250
Hema?...

2221
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:23,090
Hema!

2222
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:28,420
Hello, listen...

2223
02:18:47,590 --> 02:18:49,670
It's a case of honour
killing, My Lord.

2224
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:54,630
We have heard of many
such cases all over India.

2225
02:18:54,710 --> 02:18:59,130
But in a progressive place
like Kolkata, this was very new.

2226
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:01,550
But not impossible.

2227
02:19:01,670 --> 02:19:05,460
After killing Hema Parekh, Mrs. Survi Parekh
shut the front door and left.

2228
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:06,960
But where did she go?

2229
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:11,500
I feel that she had gone to discuss
the matter with someone she knew.

2230
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:19,300
Someone has to be framed.

2231
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:20,550
Your Honour...

2232
02:19:20,630 --> 02:19:24,300
...once Survi Parekh had returned home after
getting the advice, she realised...

2233
02:19:24,300 --> 02:19:26,960
...that she had forgotten to take her keys.

2234
02:19:27,090 --> 02:19:28,210
So she panicked.

2235
02:19:28,380 --> 02:19:32,250
She started banging on the door,
and a crowd began to gather.

2236
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:37,250
And once she entered the house she began
blaming Dhananjoy for the murder.

2237
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:43,130
Your Lordship, I'm sure we can all
understand what proceeded this event.

2238
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:50,500
A car was organised to take
Hema Parekh to the hospital.

2239
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:53,500
But that wasn't possible because of
the crowd present at the scene.

2240
02:19:53,550 --> 02:19:56,800
But the car had come.
So what was done with it?

2241
02:19:56,880 --> 02:20:01,880
Mujammal Haq and Shibu were contacted.
But why?

2242
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,300
So that Dhananjoy could not arrive
at the place of occurence.

2243
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:11,250
Because if Dhananjoy had come, then all their
calculations would have gone haywire.

2244
02:20:13,630 --> 02:20:17,300
Kavya Sinha had mentioned the
Greek tragedies in her argument.

2245
02:20:17,380 --> 02:20:21,000
I do agree with her.
Greek Tragedy. Destiny.

2246
02:20:21,090 --> 02:20:24,670
Your Lordship, destiny plays
a very important role.

2247
02:20:25,420 --> 02:20:30,920
That car was like the
hand of fate that took Dhananjoy away.

2248
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:35,750
And he travelled through the darkness
while holding on to the hand of fate.

2249
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,090
And then the papers began.

2250
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:45,380
Merely on the basis of Survi Parekh's
testimony, we all believed that...

2251
02:20:45,380 --> 02:20:50,170
... the security guard, Dhananjoy Chatterjee
was a rapist and a murderer.

2252
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:53,090
The antipathy that began
to form in the hearts of the public,

2253
02:20:53,090 --> 02:20:55,420
was fuelled by a barrage
of spicy news stories.

2254
02:20:55,590 --> 02:20:57,880
Describing Hema as
'Strangled with broken limbs.'

2255
02:20:58,090 --> 02:21:01,170
There was pressure from
the society aswell as vote banks.

2256
02:21:01,210 --> 02:21:04,420
They demanded that the
rapist must be hanged immediately!

2257
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:07,500
But I do not think that
she was ever raped.

2258
02:21:07,630 --> 02:21:11,590
Hema Parekh had
had sex with her lover.

2259
02:21:11,750 --> 02:21:16,050
Because the samples sent to
the forensics could never prove...

2260
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:18,380
...that Dhananjoy Chatterjee was guilty.

2261
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:24,250
But he wasn't given the
benefit of the doubt.

2262
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:31,880
Why didn't we calculate the time of death
on the basis of the undigested food?

2263
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:37,090
Because we folded under the pressure
of the vote bank like little children.

2264
02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:42,050
We forgot that there is a
difference between a suspect and a convict.

2265
02:21:42,550 --> 02:21:44,590
Then he was sentenced to death.

2266
02:21:44,750 --> 02:21:47,170
The hangman's depiction
of the event was released.

2267
02:21:47,170 --> 02:21:52,840
There were details like how
he had spread fat over the noose.

2268
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:55,250
And I can describe it as
nothing less than disgusting...

2269
02:21:55,250 --> 02:22:00,630
...because at that time Dhananjoy's mother
must also have been reading that paper.

2270
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,500
Is this Renaissance Bengal?

2271
02:22:04,670 --> 02:22:08,170
Are we the descendants of Rabindranath
and Raja Ram Mohan Roy?

2272
02:22:08,750 --> 02:22:14,920
We are tearing apart a
poor man who has come to trial.

2273
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:19,380
This case may have had
many alternate possibilities.

2274
02:22:19,630 --> 02:22:22,550
It might have been a
case of honour killing.

2275
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:25,960
Hema? Hema?
Hema!

2276
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:28,920
Why didn't we delve deeper?

2277
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:34,380
If after severe scrutiny Dhananjoy was proved
guilty then he should have been punished.

2278
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:40,300
But it wasn't scrutinised because
of the pressure applied by the society.

2279
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:47,340
It was made public that, Dhananjoy had
raped Hema Parekh after murdering her.

2280
02:22:47,630 --> 02:22:50,130
This was said to have come out
in the post-mortem report but...

2281
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:55,210
...there is no mention of
this in the post-mortem report.

2282
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:06,880
The court will decide whether
Dhananjoy was guilty or not.

2283
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:08,670
But I'm afraid.

2284
02:23:08,750 --> 02:23:10,750
I'm scared, Your Honour.

2285
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:14,130
Because a crowd, armoured
with the support of public opinion,

2286
02:23:14,130 --> 02:23:17,630
could stone a man to death
in the middle of the road.

2287
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:21,920
And the media would
cover that news.

2288
02:23:22,250 --> 02:23:24,670
And we would...

2289
02:23:26,090 --> 02:23:30,550
...sit at home and watch it
while chewing on pop-corn.

2290
02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:38,170
Destiny, Your Honour.

2291
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:42,090
The lady sitting there was
newly married at the time.

2292
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:45,420
She was poor.
But she had hope.

2293
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:46,500
She had some slight happiness.

2294
02:23:46,750 --> 02:23:50,670
She had faith that Dhananjoy would return
because he had said "Chandra...

2295
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,460
...nothing will happen to me.

2296
02:23:54,550 --> 02:23:56,500
Because I haven't
done anything wrong."

2297
02:23:56,590 --> 02:23:58,210
But she didn't know...

2298
02:23:58,300 --> 02:24:02,170
...that the truth needs to be proved.

2299
02:24:02,250 --> 02:24:05,670
She didn't know that you
needed the backing of society.

2300
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:10,090
The support of the public,
political back up, media back up...

2301
02:24:10,210 --> 02:24:14,050
...and this was an absolute case
of trial by media, Your Honour!

2302
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,380
You have done really-

2303
02:25:01,090 --> 02:25:05,670
Search the ashes and see if
there was a crime committed.

2304
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:11,210
Maybe Dhananjoy was trying
to say this for so many years.

2305
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:15,590
But now the decision is yours.

2306
02:25:15,710 --> 02:25:20,130
You will decide the truth.

2307
