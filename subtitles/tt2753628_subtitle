1
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,507
Hello, I am Highway Patrol
Inspector speaking.

2
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,773
I am speaking to you seeing
many miscalls on this phone.

3
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,942
That's my son's phone.
Where he is?

4
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,518
Your son has met with
an accident.

5
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,381
Accident!
What happened to him?

6
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,748
Where is he, how he is?
- What happened?

7
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,255
Let me talk.
- At least tell me.

8
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,953
How did he met with accident?
How he is now?

9
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,360
We are taking him to hospital.

10
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,290
How is my son, Doctor?

11
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,957
Your son is very strong.

12
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,296
Otherwise no one can survive
such accidents.

13
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,296
He will recover soon.

14
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,603
Yeah, and who is Shruti?

15
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,107
He keeps repeating this
name all the time.

16
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,675
If possible bring her here once.

17
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,474
After seeing her, it's possible
he will recover sooner.

18
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,421
Don't know what's happening in the
hospital for so long!

19
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,327
I am really worried...

20
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,920
Has something gone
wrong with Obi?

21
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,989
Hey, if anything happens to Obi...

22
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,558
...I shall raise havoc in Kolkata.

23
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,469
On the very first I knew that
rascal will backstab.

24
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,096
Look, Indranath Babu is here.

25
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,800
Let's go. Let's go.

26
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,880
Indra Babu,
how is Obi doing now?

27
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,779
You people haven't gone
back home yet?

28
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,350
You stopped us from going to
hospital.

29
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,787
So we are waiting here to
know about Obi's condition.

30
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,950
He is fine.

31
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,291
Doctor says the he will recover soon.

32
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,795
Sir, we are willing to donate
our blood for Obi.

33
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,560
We just want Obi back.
- Sir...

34
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,462
...he is not only your son,
he is ours too.

35
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,897
If our lives are needed for his sake,
we are willing to to that even.

36
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,803
Nothing will happen to Obi.

37
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,136
As he has your prayers with him.

38
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,107
He will soon recover and
return home.

39
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,609
Now you please leave.

40
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,516
Go now. - Okay.

41
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,048
Move your legs.

42
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,514
Do you feel it?

43
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,314
Now say.

44
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,886
Now?

45
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,867
Decide before going to Obi,
what to say.

46
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,703
Seeing us he will immediately
ask about Shruti.

47
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,638
I'll tell him has Shruti
has left you...

48
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,903
...you too forget her.

49
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,309
Have you lost your mind?

50
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,237
Obi has somehow survived.

51
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,708
Don't tell him anything
about Shruti...

52
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,717
If we don't tell him anything,
he will beat us get us admitted here.

53
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,714
Okay, leave it to me.
I will say what has to be said.

54
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,135
Obi, don't do this.

55
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,141
First you be all right,
then you'll see what we do.

56
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,986
When she doesn't love you...

57
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,582
...then why are you troubling
yourself? Forget her.

58
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,159
How can I forget her?
What should I forget?

59
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,854
From first meeting to last,
what should I forget?

60
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,332
Every moment spent with her
and everything of hers...

61
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,832
...how can I forget? How?

62
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,797
And did I love her for
forgetting?

63
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,470
I warn you, if you ever again
talked about forgetting her.

64
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,740
I shall kill you all.
Get lost.

65
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,468
Go away, never show your
faces again.

66
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,109
Get out! Go!

67
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,962
They all love you so much.

68
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,025
They want to see their
Obi, happy.

69
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:56,932
And I want to see...

70
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,000
...that my son respects love.

71
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,970
You bring back Shruti.

72
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,671
I will ask your mother...

73
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,012
...to prepare for wedding.

74
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,511
Your son has gone
to bring the bride.

75
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,043
Go.

76
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,967
Welcome.
- Greetings!

77
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,909
Greetings.
- Greetings.

78
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,505
Please be seated.

79
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,553
Bring the girl,
auspicious time is lapsing.

80
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,315
Of course.
Bring Shruti.

81
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:10,973
Shruti, let's go.

82
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,047
Why are you watching?
Kill him.

83
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:38,692
Hey...

84
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,969
You can't take her from here.

85
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,638
It's my word to father
that I'll come back with Shruti.

86
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,075
And no one has enough
guts to stop me.

87
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,115
Shruti... come here.

88
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:57,882
Shruti! Shruti!

89
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,250
Don't be afraid, Shruti.
Come to me.

90
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,621
I am here, isn't it?
Please come.

91
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,362
Okay, father!

92
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:13,961
Shruti!

93
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,404
It's me, Shruti!

94
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,802
I am your Obi!

95
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,578
Is he mad?

96
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,773
Yes.

97
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,316
Yes, he is mad.
- Shruti...

98
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,177
Shruti, I am...

99
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,447
Come, dear.

100
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,664
'I know how deeply Shruti loves me.'

101
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,125
'I don't know why she is
behaving like this with me.'

102
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,902
'She can't live without me.'

103
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,909
'She entered my life like
the frangrance of spring.'

104
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,538
Biruda, have you confirmed
the train she is arriving?

105
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,513
Yes. By Darjeeling Mail.
Morning 8.30.

106
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,978
When will the train will arrive?
- 8.30.

107
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,883
At 8.30? - Yes.
- Still there is half an hour.

108
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,558
You know, this is the first time
we are here to receive a girl, right?

109
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,355
Look at Obi.

110
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,324
Today he is so smartly dressed.

111
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,592
Because a imported chick
is coming from Kolkata. - Yeah.

112
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,891
So why wouldn't he come
well dressed?

113
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,529
Tell me what she looks like?

114
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,932
Neither fair nor dark.

115
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,228
Hey, keep quiet.

116
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,366
Age, color, fair or dark,
nothing is to bothered about.

117
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,103
Hey, will stop or should
I stop you.

118
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,940
Obi, so early at station?
Is someone arriving?

119
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,236
Which train?

120
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,475
Darjeeling Mail.
There's still time.

121
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,846
We are here much earlier.

122
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,347
Hey, you said it's arriving
at 8.30.

123
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,647
The trains arrives a 8.30
when it is late.

124
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,016
It is at right time today.

125
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,016
Should I give you good!

126
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,223
She's coming here for the first time.
Doesn't know anyone here...

127
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,023
If I don't find her,
I'll turn you guys mincemeat.

128
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,926
Hey, there are so many girls
here, how'd we know who is ours?

129
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,561
Not ours, she's only mine.
You guys are here with me.

130
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,566
Do you have any phone
number or something?

131
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,663
No. Vinuda only asked me
to escort her from the station.

132
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,203
So, Mr. Obi, how'd we recognize her?

133
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,535
You need not bother.
I'll recognize her.

134
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,474
You guys give me a miscall
when you see a nice girl.

135
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,980
Got it? Now move.

136
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,909
Go, go. go.

137
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,175
Shruti...

138
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,545
Shruti?

139
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,185
Shruti! - Shruti!

140
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,318
Is there some girl Shruti here?
- No.

141
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,924
Shruti!
- Shruti! - Shruti!

142
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,524
Shruti...
- Where is Shruti?

143
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,525
Shruti!

144
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,222
Here she is. Found her.

145
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,458
What are you doing?
Go away.

146
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,259
Have you found her?

147
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,828
Bro, we found one...

148
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,667
...but she is already an
expiry dated.

149
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,208
Okay, fine.
Look for her everywhere.

150
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,903
Tea stall, Bookstall, don't
spare any place.

151
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,172
We've looked at every place.

152
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,540
Now I am standing before
the Ladies Toilet...

153
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,875
Listen, be posted there
but don't enter in.

154
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,642
Hey, this is ladies toilet!
Go away!

155
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,846
Hello, sir.

156
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,909
What happened?
Why holding my collor?

157
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,773
Empty envelope within envelope,
height of ignorance.

158
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,239
Get it?
- No.

159
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,010
Check your pocket and see
whether you have your purse?

160
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,682
No. - Hmm!

161
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,883
Your purse has entered
his pocket.

162
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,553
Now take care.

163
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,392
Is this girl Shruti?

164
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,959
And if not...

165
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,760
...then?

166
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,250
Obi?

167
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,362
Yes. - Shruti.

168
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,795
Shall we?

169
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,798
Leave my hand and
I have take my bag.

170
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,204
Oh! I will carry it.

171
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,211
Vinuda has told me everything
about you on phone.

172
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,611
In detail? - Yes.

173
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,273
What has he told you?

174
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,150
Just this that a guy named
Obi will come to receive you.

175
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,579
Smart looking, friendly...

176
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,883
...tough.
But golden hearted.

177
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,328
That's how I could recongnize
you at first glance.

178
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,262
Actually I am this
since childhood.

179
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,828
Dad says if you aren't good,
no one will love you.

180
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,265
Vinuda, has mentioned
one more thing.

181
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,733
What more has he said?

182
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,969
You are very decent.

183
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,697
Oh... yeah...

184
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,533
Come.

185
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,936
I had decided, had I not found
you, I'd not have returned home.

186
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,981
Come on, I ran up and down
so much on platform...

187
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,517
...l'd have reached Darjeeling.

188
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,883
The place I was waiting,
my life was at risk.

189
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,555
Hey, why has the geography
of your face has changed?

190
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,327
You look like a monk
of Ballur Math.

191
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,453
Don't say more.

192
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,054
Vinuda has already has given my
false character certificate to Shruti.

193
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,525
That's why I am like saint
Swami Premanand.

194
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,568
Seeing a girl, not only geography,
history too changes.

195
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,729
As it is your geography has
changed.

196
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,911
Since the day I am driving
no one has taken ride in my car.

197
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,080
So, seeing your coming...

198
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,275
...my heart is dancing with joy...

199
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,546
...that somebody will ride
in my car.

200
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,548
Come let's go. Be quick.

201
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,153
You take the car, I'll follow.

202
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,726
Why, there is ample place
in he car?

203
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,418
Actually, I have a bike.

204
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,224
Bike!
Then I too come on the bike.

205
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,858
Hey! Why the bike?
There is the car.

206
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,494
I will take the bike.

207
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,163
You heard, quietly take the
luggage and go.

208
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,932
We are coming.

209
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,300
If there's nothing in fate,
what's the use of crying!

210
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,436
Don't you forget that
you are a nice guy.

211
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,082
Thanks, for reminding me.

212
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,430
Obi, your speeding is increasing.
Go slow.

213
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,995
Oh. All right.

214
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,338
Pass by. As it is I am blocked.

215
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,646
Riding a cycle and asking for side!

216
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,486
Guys! Let me pass.
I am in hurry.

217
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,055
What's the hurry.
Are you getting married? . Go.

218
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,323
Sir, will you give me a lift
on your bicycle, please?

219
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,394
Sorry, madam.
I never give a ride to a girl.

220
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,529
Please, I am in great difficulty.

221
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,128
Please, change your principals.
- Bye! Bye!

222
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,166
Hey, sir! - Sitting on a mobike,
why're you seeking ride on a cycle?

223
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,900
Is it some bike? - Yes.

224
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,610
I had completely forgotten.

225
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,644
I feel I am going on
some wheelchair.

226
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,177
Can't you any faster?

227
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,347
I can, but my bike has
only two gears.

228
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,479
First and fifth gear.
Rest of them are disconnected.

229
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,423
So why not in fifth gear?

230
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,823
You hold on to me
and I will take the fifth gear.

231
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,888
Oh, God!

232
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,041
Be careful, watch!

233
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,282
Yeah!

234
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,636
Hey, who is Obi?

235
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,697
Why, do you want to thrash him?

236
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,474
Bro, will thrash you instead.

237
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,240
Hey! If I find him I will
stab him to death.

238
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,871
Take care of your top,
front and behind.

239
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,973
Once you're in his hands
you'll find no place to hide.

240
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,281
Hey, you scoundrel!

241
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,386
Now say it, you pig!

242
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,514
Where is Obi?
Where is he?

243
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,922
Hey, hey! Why are you
beating him?

244
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,787
Damn, you!
I am looking for someone. Got it?

245
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,926
I'll murder him
- What has he done?

246
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,829
He has beat up one
one of our auto driver.

247
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,295
I am union secretary.
- Oh, yes?

248
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,303
As soon as possible
run from here.

249
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,307
If you come to face him,
you won't be able to even sit.

250
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,401
Hey! You will get a beating.
- Don't touch me.

251
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,003
What did you say?
Don't raise your hands and talk.

252
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,777
Guy! Are you in tearing hurry?

253
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,176
A bit.

254
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,179
I have a precious thing at the back.
Have to make delivery.

255
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,282
First tell me who is Obi,
and where he stays?

256
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,825
Scrawny! Didn't you find
anyone else to ask?

257
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,586
You are asking Obi,
who is Obi?

258
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,789
Hey! I will slit her neck.
- Really?

259
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,864
Go ahead.
Let's see how daring you are.

260
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,734
I will finish her.
Slash her with dagger.

261
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,100
C'mon do it?
- Don't come near.

262
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,872
Why talk so much.

263
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,444
Finish in one sentence.

264
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,710
I shall finish you at once.

265
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,230
Vinuda! - Yes.

266
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,497
You take her home.
- Come.

267
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,763
No, I won't go.
I like to watch fights.

268
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,966
You beat them up,
I shall watch.

269
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,348
Did not I tell you, I am in hurry?
You did not hear.

270
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:27,147
Finish a matter in one sentence,
else your head on my hands.

271
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,260
I warned you many times...

272
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,729
...that you should not put your hands
in fire, you won't be able to save it.

273
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,196
But who listens!

274
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,291
Who is it?

275
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,265
Who got beaten up?
- This guy.

276
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,233
Despite warning why did not you
listen to them?

277
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,439
Came to fight with my son?

278
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,170
Arrange for his treatment.
- Yes.

279
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,414
Are you new to this area?
- Yes.

280
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,815
That's why...

281
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,912
Being subsurvient, you've got
your limbs broken...

282
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,422
...how would you feed
your family now?

283
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,819
Have you had something to eat
orjust had the beating?

284
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,520
Eat and go.

285
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,761
Wow! House so well decorated!

286
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,832
This was my room first.

287
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,097
As you were to come,
dad has redone it.

288
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:21,208
New bed, new freezer
and AC is also new.

289
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,640
A new TV is being brought
for you.

290
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,382
Hey, sit with your feet down.

291
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,175
What is Vinuda?
I has asked you not to do all this.

292
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,253
It's first time you are
at my home.

293
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,555
Isn't it important to take
good care of you?

294
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,458
When you were a child
I never let you off my lap.

295
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,421
For that reason I also got lots
of scolding from your father.

296
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,394
I too haven't forgotten
those days.

297
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,031
It has remained in my memories.

298
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,635
After your returning...

299
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,267
...my mother too left me alone.

300
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,501
Don't worry. I am there for you.

301
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,844
Mother, has prepared
nice dishes for you.

302
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,877
Come, let's test it.
Come on.

303
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,945
Obida! She's my paternal aunt.

304
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,088
I know. I have brought her.
You go.

305
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,548
Bring a glass of water for me.
Go.

306
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,820
I am busy.
You get it yourself.

307
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,122
You mice!

308
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,456
Be careful.

309
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,861
Vinuda! Get me a glass of water.

310
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,863
Oh, no. I have to get the TV
installed in Shruti's room.

311
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,832
You manage.

312
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,958
Damn!

313
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,063
Sis-in-law, get me a glass of water.

314
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,970
My hands are not free.
The meals aren't still cooked.

315
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:31,379
What is it sis-in-law? He's asking
for water and no one is giving it?

316
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,384
Don't make it a habit.
You'll be in trouble.

317
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,847
In trouble?

318
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,579
Why?
- You don't know him yet.

319
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,851
Listen, sis-in-law.
I am capable of reading a man.

320
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,718
One look and I can make
out how he is.

321
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,989
Oh, we never even understood
him...

322
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,530
...and you've read him so soon?

323
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,891
So should I introduce you?

324
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,324
He is very decent.

325
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,595
Decent?
You'll realize.

326
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,398
Here it is.

327
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,003
Thank God! At least someone in
this house is sympathetic.

328
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,869
Shruti!

329
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,949
Please put the fan on,
it's too hot.

330
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,921
Shruti! Take this.

331
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,390
Shruti!

332
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,374
The fan is moving, freeze it.

333
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,138
Please, I am feeling too hot.

334
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,546
Yes, turn a bit.

335
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,154
No, no, a little left.

336
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,055
No. A little in the centre.

337
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,724
Still in the centre...

338
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,818
Yeah, enough. Fix it. Fix.

339
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,687
Listen.

340
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,562
Bring that centre table a bit
closer. - What?

341
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,996
My legs a hurting.
I will put it on it.

342
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:06,866
Shruti!

343
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,304
Will you raise my leg?

344
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,747
Isn't it a bit too much, right?

345
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,081
Actually I am like this.

346
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,181
In no time I consider
everyone close.

347
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,925
You don't think so, isn't it?

348
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,393
All right, I will do it myself.

349
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,089
Got tired, right?
That's what I stopped you.

350
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,829
Give me the glass.
- Listen.

351
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,405
Don't listen to her. There is an oil
bottle in that room, bring it.

352
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:47,048
Actually I sat down, my back has
caught me, so I'm unable to standup.

353
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,274
Please.

354
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,584
Here it is.

355
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,589
What? Massage me.

356
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,498
Will I massage you?
- Than what?

357
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,664
I fought for you and
you can't even massage me?

358
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,668
My shoulders are frozen.

359
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,400
Hey, Vinuda!
What special being cooked?

360
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,869
Hey, it's Saturday today.
It's my fasting day.

361
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,040
It is your fasting day,
not of everyone, right?

362
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,516
I've heard you've brought
fish and meat.

363
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,217
No, If I had you would know.

364
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,281
If knows it, nothing will be left
for other, he'll finish it.

365
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,417
Hey, why have you stopped?
Massage me.

366
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,637
Slightly to the left.

367
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,131
No, a bit right.

368
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,171
A bit down, yes softly.

369
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,781
Hey, what are you doing?
Massage properly.

370
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,949
Gosh, are you massaging
or hammering loundary?

371
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,886
I can't do better than this.
- Okay, all right...

372
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,126
Oh, such a fast progress?

373
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,092
Those who are thrashed they
aren't able to stand on their feet...

374
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,163
...and the one who did it,
he's getting massaged here.

375
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,561
Now a days fights have become
tedious, boss.

376
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,703
Actually, what it is, do you know?

377
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,432
If some delicate flower
requests me...

378
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,133
...then I get fully charged.

379
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,742
And once battery isn't drained
I keep beating.

380
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,638
Oh, so all that was for
the delicate girl?

381
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,179
Who is delicate flower?
- You.

382
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,450
Had not you asked me
would I have beaten them up?

383
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,723
Me... I am delicate?
- Yes.

384
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,721
Hold on, I will show you.

385
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,656
Hey, hey! What happened?
- Run Run.

386
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,027
Hey, delicate flower!
- Come, I'll show you!

387
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,091
Hey! My God!

388
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,467
Look, bro and sis, what she is doing!
- I won't spare you!

389
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,912
What kind of intoxication is
this in these eyes.

390
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,141
I can't live without or forget you.

391
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:39,582
Some strange dreams
want to touch you.

392
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:43,058
What kind of intoxication
of these eyes.

393
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,358
I can't live without you
and forget you.

394
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:52,094
Both the eyes want you
always before them.

395
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,372
Know not, how it happened.

396
00:32:55,506 --> 00:33:00,307
Passion of my love
is always surrounded by dreams.

397
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:06,572

Earth seems illusory now.

402
00:33:54,932 --> 00:34:00,461
Sleep from my eyes have vanished.

403
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:06,806
When I come close to you
my desires and hopes arise.

404
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:12,106
All my thoughts takes the form of
love's lyrics.

405
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:19,081
What kind of intoxication is
of these eyes.

406
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:25,122
Some strange dreams
want to touch you.

407
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,365
Know not, how it happened.

408
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:33,393
Passion of my love
is always surrounded by dreams.

409
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:39,473

This crazy... Ioves you.

413
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:27,218
Either I didn't understand
nor did I look for.

414
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:33,291
Under the clouds and warm sunshine,
I did not look for myself.

415
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:39,869
In the far and joyous skies.

416
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:45,269
As the days and nights pass by,
my heart looks for you.

417
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:52,346
What kind of intoxication is
this in these eyes.

This crazy... Ioves you.

425
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,818
Shruti!

426
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,594
Shruti, get out form here.

427
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,165
Come. - What's it?

428
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,271
Hey! Where are you taking me?

429
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,411
What's happening?

430
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,744
Hey!
- Come this way.

431
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:38,877
Hey!

432
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,292
Let go off me.

433
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,222
Where are you taking me?

434
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,924
Will you tell me what's happening?

435
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,603
Why have you brought me here?

436
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,173
Fragrance is so pleasant.
What shampoo you've used?

437
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,939
You have brought me here
to smell the shampoo?

438
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,970
Slowly, they will know we are here.

439
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,673
That's why I will go from here.
Let me go.

440
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,975
Shruti! Don't go.

441
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,775
Keep quiet.

442
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,815
Hey, let me go.
What are you up to?

443
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,456
Shruti, I am telling you not to go.
You will be trouble.

444
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,047
I am asking you to let me off!
- Shruti...

445
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,923
Why're you acting like this.
They'll come here.

446
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,094
Shruti! - Leave me.

447
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,965
Leave me.
- Don't go now.

448
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,168
I am asking you to wait here.

449
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,710
Shruti, don't go.
Shruti! Shruti!

450
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,107
Did you see what happened?
You did not listen to me.

451
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,476
Now we'll drench in colors.

452
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,208
Every year you escape...

453
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,445
This year too I will escape.

454
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,709
You look so beautiful
as the goddess of colors.

455
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,144
That's why they say, when you
go out listen to elders' advise.

456
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,652
It's a record. For last 10 years
no one could drench me with color.

457
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,458
It's guarantee that they will not be
able put color on me in next 10 year.

458
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,961
Yeah!

459
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,098
I did it, I did it.

460
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,334
Yes! Yes!

461
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,055
I have done it.

462
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,267
Come on move it.
Easy, easy.

463
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,472
You guys get going.
- I will come.

464
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,935
What's this? You haven't
completed the loading, Hurry.

465
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,376
It's done. - Let's go.
Yes, let's go.

466
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,869
Just a minute.

467
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,108
Where are you going?
- Swamiji's Ashram.

468
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,152
How do you know that we are
going to Swamiji's place?

469
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,253
Gosh! Yesterday you were talking
so loudly on phone, the world knew it.

470
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,253
Entire Phoolwadi neighbouthood
know it.

471
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,685
Whom were you trying
to make listen.

472
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,654
To my girlfriend. - Oh!

473
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,559
Because she is deaf,
so I was at full volume.

474
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,995
Shruti, come sit in my car and go.

475
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,663
Why would I go in your car?

476
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,460
You continue with the goods,
I will follow on the bike.

477
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,003
C'mon!
- But... bike again?

478
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,427
The same two gear bike?

479
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,107
Only the fifth and first gear,
other gears don't work.

480
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:52,840
Whatever gear works would do.

481
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:57,979
Hey, have you taken chocolates,
goodies for children?

482
00:41:58,382 --> 00:41:59,371
Yes, uncle.

483
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,777
According to your list everything
it in the car.

484
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,121
Oh, damn!
This entire company is a fraud.

485
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,150
She is putting her lable
on sombody's goods.

486
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,748
You too are going?
- Yes, uncle.

487
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,757
Go, go. If you sit even for a few
minutes you get mental peace.

488
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,666
He is Omniscient.
Whatever he says happens.

489
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:20,796
Obi, Find out what progress is
made in children's school.

490
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,765
Fine. I will be back.

491
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,170
Look, pray to god that this
alliance is finalized.

492
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,470
I think this is completed
in the coming month.

493
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,437
Okay. Bye.

494
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,276
Bye! - Come let's go.

495
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,284
Obi! - Yeah?

496
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,316
Remember to mentioned what
I've asked you to convey to him.

497
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,518
Mother, don't you have
anything else to say?

498
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,681
No.

499
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,194
You better tell me I will remind
him to ask him.

500
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,754
I am looking for a good
alliance for my Obi.

501
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,693
His father has talking to many
matrimonial agents.

502
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,897
But we are unable to find
anything suitable.

503
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,603
Even today he has gone
to look a girl.

504
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,172
Look, how my son's face
is getting paler.

505
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,764
Let me see.

506
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,438
Yeah, it looks dried up.

507
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,910
It'd due to harsh sun light.

508
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,673
Mother, you better go.
- Hold on.

509
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,049
Dear, you please remind Swamiji.

510
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,684
Ask him to find a good alliance
for my son.

511
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,183
Don't you worry at all.

512
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,150
I will get a good news
today itself.

513
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,984
Enough. Now sit.

514
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,526
Be careful.
- Yes.

515
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,757
Are you climbing a tree
or riding a bike.

516
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,862
Climbing up your neck. Now move.
- All right.

517
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,891
We'll be back. - Bye, aunt.

518
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:26,860
Hail Goddess Mother!

519
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,167
Did you tell aunt about your
girlfriend?

520
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,773
When I do not know myself,
how'd I tell anyone?

521
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,866
Obi, there is meeting at the
club in the evening. - I know.

522
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,207
Obi, there was a call form the
police station, to meet them.

523
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,072
Don't go alone, take me along,
else they will put you behind bars.

524
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,948
Hey, you are hero to his place!

525
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,453
People are calling you
from everywhere.

526
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,182
Everybody here are like
my relatives.

527
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,220
The sooner you help someone
other pops up.

528
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,786
The way the share meals
with each other...

529
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,824
...they also share there
sorrow and happiness.

530
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,959
That's why I have started to love
this place in no time.

531
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,467
Be here for a few more days...

532

By the way...

534
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:09,572
Sheela sis-in-law is well known
but he is very dangerous?

535
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,311
Why mention such things
at such a happy occasion?

536
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,711
The mention of Papa,
my mood goes off.

537
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:20,450
Take my phone.

538
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,153

00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,444
Grandpa did not come?

550
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,976
Who is this sister?
- Her name is Shruti.

551
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,347
She is Miss Kolkata.

552
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,589
Oh, Miss Kolkata!
- Yes.

553
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,724
Is she having a crown
on her head?

554
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,890
We sold her crown and
brought chocolates for you.

555
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,625
Such a famous personality is here,
go and welcome her.

556
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:37,758
Go, go, go.

559
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:55,341
Listen...

560
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:58,018
...go and see whether the guy who
was sent to look after the kitchen...

561
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,249
...has he done his job properly or not.
- Okay.

562
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:12,130
Hey, stop! Hold on!
I won't let you off now.

563
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,241
Gosh, I am unable to catch anybody.
- Hey!

564
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,639
Hey, caught, caught you.
- Hey... it's. me.

565
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,317
I enjoyed with you all so much.
Here, take it.

566
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:29,917
You continue playing. Bye.
- Tata.

567
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,250
Bye! Bye! Bye!
- Okay, see you all, bye.

568
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,688
For a while I felt I too have
become a child with them.

569
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,588
Now you aren't, are you?

570
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,259
Really, how happy they are.

571
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,389
Seeing them it does not look
as if they're in some Ashram.

572
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,862
Dad has great plans
for this Asharm.

573
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,403
The place you see there,
it will be dormitory for children.

574
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,065
And here, school building
and library will be constructed.

575
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,572
Also the hospital plan
is sanctioned.

576
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,637
There are many more dreams still.

577
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,315
Really, I felt very peaceful here.

578
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,553
This is nothing. Once you
meet Swamiji, you will see...

579
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,051
...you will be much more at peace.
Let's go.

580
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:25,636
Obi! - Shh...

581
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,414
How are you, Obi?

582
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,577
I am fine.

583
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,120
She's Shruti, form Kolkata.

584
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,461
My Vinuda is her relative.

585
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,955
Father wanted to know how far
the school project has progressed.

586
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,227
Doors are windows are installed.
- Okay.

587
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,862
It's been long since there
is no news.

588
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,333
So father was worried,
if there is any problem.

589
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,274
If contractor is to be changed
then...

590
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,969
Hey, no. no.
There is nothing to worry.

591
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,372
Tell your father that the work
will be over within a month.

592
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:08,773
All right.

593
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,111
And Uniforms for the school
kid is required? - No.

594
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:16,284
Your father has given enough.
If need be, I will ask.

595
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,857
Fine, Swamiji.
I will take your leave.

596
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:20,625
Let's go. - Hey!

597
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,891
You haven't asked what your
mother asked you to.

598
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:24,900
There nothing to be asked,
let's go.

599
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,367
What it is, Obi?

600
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,228
Nothing much, Swamiji.

601
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,699
Something related to his
marriage was to be asked.

602
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,172
Uncle, has contacted many
marriage bureaus.

603
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,570
But not suitable match
is found.

604
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,981
And here his face is paling.

605
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,410
Let it be.
Swamiji, there is nothing.

606
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,750
Parents are bothering where
will I get a suitable bride.

607
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,685
And for this useless affair
they are bothering me all the time.

608
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:51,093
You only tell me as to
where will I find a girl.

609
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,593
She is so close to you.

610
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:04,363
And she is the one who will be
your future better half.

611
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:58,387
I am wide awake embracing
your night's sleep.

How you are you sir, fine?
- Yes, I am good.

648
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,764
Hey, give them what
they are asking for.

649
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:32,332
Grandpa, I want Kulchi.
- No, take something else.

650
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:36,032
Hello, Mr. Indranath Babu.
- Hello, hello.

651
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,768
Hey, I was thinking about you
for last 2 days. - Why?

652
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,934
Because we haven't met.
- Oh!

653
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,445
How is your grandchild? Is he okay?
- Yes, he's fine.

654
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:48,013
Hey, you bought Kulchi.
Had not I asked not to?

655
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,382
At your age you're doing this?
- Then when I will do it, at your age?

656
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:55,390
Look, he is just a child
and talks so much.

657
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,089
You guys concentrate on
your studies.

658
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,896
Hey, what's your bill?

659
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:06,864
No, no.
Come on, keep it.

660
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,199
Okay, I will leave.
- Yeah, see you.

661
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,637
Hey, Debu, hold this.

662
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,177
Sir, here is the rent.

663
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:20,744
When your wife is to
become a mother, isn't it?

664
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,677
Yes, sir. - Then don't you
need money or that.

665
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,054
Sir, the rent is pending
since last 7 months.

666
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,148
Your rent does not take
care of my household.

667
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:31,860
With this money buy fruits,
medicines for her.

668
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,755
Go.
- Sir...

669
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,091
If you talk more,
you will get a slap.

670
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,735
Go. Move.

671
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,798
Who is that man buying
goodies for the kids?

672
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,500
And refusing to accept the rent,
is he mad or something?

673
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:49,839
Hey, are you new here?
- Yes.

674
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:51,946
That's why you are saved,

675
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,213
Do you see this market,
it is his.

676
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,178
People in this locality
consider him God.

677
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,891
If say anything against
him otherwise, I'll chop you off.

678
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,288
No sorries will do.
- I am leaving.

679
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:09,061
Man, are you going?

680
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,258
Sis, tie it with this.

681
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,628
No, it's to long,
give me the smaller one.

682
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,238
Is this right?
- Yeah, it's perfect.

683
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,170
Now watch how far
it will go.

684
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,006
Tell me whom to target?

685
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,305
Hit his head.

686
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,008
No, not on the head.

687
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,915
Then hit the glass of that window.

688
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,720
Yeah, so he comes and
hits me!

689
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:40,191
Hey, should I hit that board?

690
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,455
No.

691
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:47,499
So how about that bulb?

692
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,533
Never dare, that's Brother Obi's
house. He will hit back.

693
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,464
Keep quiet.
You need not say anything.

694
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:53,531
Just watch.

695
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:07,345
Oh God!

696
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:10,390
Now he will break out head.
- Sit down.

697
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,795
Now the real bulb will be broken.
- Will you keep quite!

698
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,768
Now our fate is decided.
- Don't be afraid, I am there.

699
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,907
Why would I be afraid. If asked
I will tell that you did it.

700
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,637
Hey, you were the one
who told me to do it.

701
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:31,075
Did I ask you to hit brother
Obi's head?

702
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:32,370
Now what?

703
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,782
What else, brother Obi, will tie us
both to the lamp post, beat us...

704
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,513
...and everyone will watch.

705
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,483
You keep your mouth shut
and I will give you Cadburys.

706
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:51,266
Tinku! Where there is so much
noise outside?

707
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,027
Come let's go and see.

708
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,161
Who did it!

709
00:57:56,272 --> 00:58:00,265
No, no. - Listen to me.
Listen, what I say.

710
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:02,536
No, don't.
Here some murder will happen.

711
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,476
Damn, I won't be here.
- Hey, Tinku.

712
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,945
No, nobody known to us.

713
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,486
The one who is hit is still
alive and lives the house above.

714
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,222
It was all preplanned.

715
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,594
If he is culprit is caught he'll be
booked for attempt to murder.

716
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:20,989
You guys, what were you
doing?

717
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,657
Someone just came and
hit Obi and escaped...

718
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,256
...and you guys couldn't
do anything?

719
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,335
What were you doing? What?

720
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,173
Come on let it be, I am fine.
- No, you are not.

721
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,009
It concerns head injury.

722
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,445
You say, how was he to look at.

723
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,209
Wherever he is,
I will find out.

724
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,978
I will take out my car from the
garge. Where will he escape?

725
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,483
We will sit in the car
and look for him.

726
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,956
Believe me, I did not do
anything, brother.

727
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,557
I swear on Goddes Kali.

728
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,935
And your boys have destroyed
my house and everything.

729
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,707
I have left everything I did
earlier. Believe me.

730
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:09,005
Hey, don't believe him at all.
He is lying.

731
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:10,272
And now trying to be
a gentleman.

732
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:13,415
He is the one who did it.
- Ok, I know who did. You go home.

733
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,876
Hey, you go now.

734
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:25,320
Greetings, sis-in-law.
Don't worry at all.

735
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:28,495
Obi, now what's to be done,
I will do it.

736
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:31,523
Hey, all of you go now.
- Smile for a photograph, sir.

737
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,165
Get lost.
Is it an occasion to smile?

738
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,931
You don't look at the situation,
here something tragic has happened...

739
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,497
...everyone is sad faced.
Now take the photograph.

740
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,272
And write that local legislator
Prakash Rai...

741
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,075
...was present at the
place of accident.

742
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,548
Also that he expressed
to Obi who's hurt and his mother...

743
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,619
...his sympathies.
Make sure to write that.

744
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,650
What I have said that only...

745
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,419
Mr. Prakash, let it be.
- Why are you saying so...

746
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:57,152
...such a tragic incident has
take place...

747
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,818
...and will I let it go
just like this?

748
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:01,463
It could be a Maoist incident too.

749
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,598
I am going to raise this issue
in the assembly.

750
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,861
Bring the person who has
hit me.

751
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,933
I will break bone and
parcel it.

752
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,805
You know what I will do? As long
as don't find out that person...

753
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:19,712
...l'll not wear the shirt till then.
- Why are you guys shouting so much?

754
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,774
What, what are you saying?
Do you have any idea?

755
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:25,680
If something more had happened,
what would have happened...

756
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,518
Such a large stone was
brought to him.

757
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:30,684
Because he could not throw
the big one he threw smaller one.

758
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,260
It's just a minor attempt,
later it will be his life.

759
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,159
We will kill him.
No, no.

760
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,731
Whoever you have doubt
for throwing the stone... - Ok, ok.

761
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:37,823
...arrest everyone of them.

762
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,868
Arrest everyone of them.

763
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:42,234
You leave, we will take
care of everything.

764
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,101
Sis-in-law!

765
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,307
As Vinuda, not to register
complain at the police station.

766
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,042
What Vinuda is going to do, I am not
concerned, but I will do something.

767
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,281
How dare he, that he came to
the house and hit my son!

768
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,487
You go. Get freshen up,
and come with me to the temple.

769
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,656
Why?
- I've taken a vow for Obi.

770
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:03,520
Just for such a minor matter,
you have take vow too?

771
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,027
Why not? It's a matter of head
injury, if something goes wrong then?

772
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:28,715
Come, Shruti, come.

773
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:37,883
Are you jittery seeing all this?

774
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:40,658
It's always like this.
Once I had fever...

775
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,128
...Dr. was late just for 12 minutes
and the declared strike for 12 hours.

776
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,194
He will be found.
Where will he run injuring me.

777
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,965
Once he comes in my hands,
I will thrash him good.

778
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:53,798
Obi.

779
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,107
I want to talk to you something.

780
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,809
Alone.

781
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:03,578
What's it, Shruti?

782
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,821
Ask them not to go to police.

783
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:10,182
And there is no need to
look for who has hit you.

784
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:13,319
Hey. shouldn't he be
taught a lesson, who attacked me?

785
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:16,063
This apart, don't you also
like seeing fights.

786
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,796
It's fine watching
but not being in it.

787
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:21,492
Meaning?

788
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:24,104
I am the culprit.
- What?

789
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,173
I did not do it deliberately.

790
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,569
Actually, I waned to break
the bulb of your house.

791
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,142
Instead your head came
before it.

792
01:02:32,715 --> 01:02:33,704
Sorry.

793
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,139
Then fine.

794
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,014
To tell you the truth...

795
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:40,511
...there was no hurt in
this injury.

796
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,657
But the seven days
you did not talk to me...

797
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:45,184
...that was much hurting.

798
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,222
Do you know, I could not
even eat properly all these days.

799
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,062
Couldn't even sleep properly.

800
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,732
Shruti, don't you love me at all?

801
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,910
Are you in love with
someone else?

802
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,845
Forget about loving someone...

803
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,479
...if I want to even die,
I can't do it as per my wish.

804
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,120
You don't know my father.

805
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,526
My life, death, everything will
be as per my father's wishes.

806
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,588
But your case is different.

807
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,161
Because you have such
a good parents.

808
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,835
Everyone here loves you
so much.

809
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,527
They are even willing
to give their lives for you.

810
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:31,200
Just because you are
injured so slightly...

811
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,101
...they all have come
running to you.

812
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,779
And if I am lying on death bed...

813
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,076
...my father wouldn't even know.

814
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:44,948
These few days...

815
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,152
...you have made me forget
my sorrows.

816
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,148
You are a very good friend of mine.
Add from previous last.

817
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,322
To love you...

818
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,691
...is not in my fate.

819
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,725
With this misfortune of mine...

820
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:01,193
...don't try to associated, Obi.

821
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,139
Hello!

822
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,232
Hi.

823
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:10,008
Is my ticket confirmed?

824
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,670
What's your name?
- Shruti Roy.

825
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,415
Just give me a minute.

826
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:17,318
Kolkata, Wednesday, 3.25 pm.

827
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,345
Thank you.
- Welcome.

828
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:28,855
Shruti.

829
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,898
Tinky said the you wanted
to talking to me?

830
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:35,726
Obi.

831
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,001
What happened the other day...

832
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,010
...after that... Shruti, you're
still with the same topic?

833
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,408
I know, you didn't hurt me
deliberately.

834
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,740
No, no. Not about that.

835
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,545
Oh, so is it about your father?

836
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:51,911
Because I know, whatever
you said was in anxiety.

837
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:53,520
I am not bothered about it.

838
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,753
And you too don't worry
about it. - Holu!

839
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,156
I am unable to explain now...
- Holuda!

840
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:02,820
Holu!

841
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,129
I know you deeply love me.

842
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,931
And that's my greatest fear.

843
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,734
For the better of both of us...

844
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:13,969
...I am leaving from here tomorrow.

845
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:15,132
But, I...

846
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,381
Debu! - I want to live.

847
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:21,211
What's the matter, Debu?
Who's this girl?

848
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:25,218
Holu, lives in Padakata,
and I love her a lot.

849
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,316
So why you want to commit
suicide?

850
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,588
Actually, her brother is
a don of this area.

851
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:34,026
And fearing him,
she couldn't take my name.

852
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,528
Her brother will never agree
to our affair.

853
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,664
It is quiet possible the
may kill me.

854
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,337
Love is not in my fate.

855
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:45,102
Get up. Don't talk like a fool.

856
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,038
Fate cannot be changed with suicide.

857
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,305
To change one's fate
one has to try himself.

858
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,648
Listen. Your life is yours.

859
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,747
You can mould it as you wish.

860
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:59,376
It's you who will decide who you
will love or not, not your brother.

861
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:03,282
Listen to your conscience
and do accordingly.

862
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,561
Don't do something being afraid
that you repent later in life.

863
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:13,501
Destroying self cannot make
for keeping love alive.

864
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,237
One has to hold someone's
hand with trust.

865
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,807
Debu, take her with you.
I will talk to her brother. Go.

866
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:24,905
Come.

867
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,053
They act foolishly.

868
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,124
Yeah, you were saying something?

869
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,824
I too am also going to
act foolishly.

870
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,294
But I am sure...

871
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:44,624
...that the open who comes
to the aid of everyone...

872
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,331
...he will also gladly give
life for my sake.

873
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:50,602
I won't say anything more.

874
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:16,692
My heart's ringtone.

875
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:20,258
Is now ringing of my love.

876
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:24,132
My heart's ringtone
is ringing of my love.

877
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:27,835
My heart says,
Hello, Hello, Hi, Hi.

878
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:31,640
Open the doors of my life
ring the bell and come in.

879
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:35,275
Heart says,
Hello, Hello, Hi, Hi.

880
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:39,148
Heart binds with you
and dances with you.

881
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:42,315
You're the one dwelling in my heart.

882
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:45,986
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

883
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:49,789
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

884
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:53,390
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

885
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:58,036
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

886
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:19,518
Nothing seems better than
this appearance.

887
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:26,965
What should I do, tell me
what's in your heart now.

888
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:34,840
But for you my heart is
unable to think of anything.

889
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:42,677
What should I do, tell me,
what's in your heart now.

890
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:49,721
My heart ties up with you, it dances
with you, there is nothing else.

891
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:53,519
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

892
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:57,096
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

893
01:08:57,433 --> 01:09:00,960
Signal, signal, siganal,
give me the signal of your love.

894
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:05,368
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

895
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:26,952
In strange inebriation my heart
keeps writing letter to you.

896
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:34,332
You are my love story,
my heart is lost in your love.

897
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:42,137
In strange inebriation my heart
keeps writing letter to you.

898
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:50,007
You are my love story,
my heart is lost in your love.

899
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:05,195
My heart's ringtone
is ringing of my love.

900
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:09,062
My heart's ringtone
is ringing of my love.

901
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:12,937
My heart says,
Hello, Hello, Hi, Hi.

902
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:16,637
Open the doors of my life
ring the bell and come in.

903
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:20,443
My heart says,
Hello, Hello, Hi, Hi.

904
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:27,512
Heart binds with you
and dances with you.

905
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:31,026
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

906
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:34,729
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

907
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,526
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

908
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:43,732
Signal, signal, signal,
give me the signal of your love.

909
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,774
What happened, tell me?
- You were right.

910
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,589
No one has ever been happy
suppressing her wishes.

911
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:03,419
Do what your heart says.

912
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:05,325
And I have done the same.

913
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:07,358
I am very happy today.

914
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,360
I feel like a free bird.
- Wait a minute.

915
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:12,389
Don't do it because
I said it.

916
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:16,261
Will you be get rid of the fear
with which you lived so long?

917
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:18,571
Listen to your heart.

918
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,966
Whatever it says, do that.

919
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,505
I will, if my heart is with me?

920
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:28,316
That is fixed deposited in
Obi's heart.

921
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:31,147
And once it's deposited...

922
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,744
...it's locked for lifelong.

923
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,654
It can't be removed.
- Hey, why would one withdraw?

924
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:38,919
On maturity the return will
be with interest...

925
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,365
Hey, if you open your mouth
so wide flies will get into it.

926
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:45,195
Does mouth want to shut?

927
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,929
Because stomach demands
feeding. - Be ware, boss!

928
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,737
Hey, this is...
- Ok, all right.

929
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,599
Tomorrow's lunch is on me.

930
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:57,437
Hey, eat easy, it seems you guys
got to eat after 7 births.

931
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,103
Whatever you wish to
understand, you may.

932
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:01,476
Shruti, repeat the order.

933
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,652
No, it's enough, enough.

934
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,715
Guy, whatever is on the table,
bring it once more.

935
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,023
Hey, first finish what's on table,
then you can have more.

936
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,315
It will be over in no time.

937
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,452
That's why your faces
are so puffed up.

938
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,095
Don't disturb while eating.

939
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:16,325
Really!

940
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:17,831
Shruti?

941
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,528
Hey, Shruti!

942
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,301
Isn't it enjoyable?
- Hey, Shruti!

943
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:23,337
Shruti! Hey, Shruti!
- Who?

944
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,940
Hey, she is my friend.

945
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,836
We were studying together.

946
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,142
Shruti! Hey, Shruti!

947
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,446
Shruti! - The dish is so nice.
- Shruti!

948
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,512
Perhaps she is calling you.

949
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:36,944
Shruti!

950
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:39,344
No, not me.
Someone else may be.

951
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:40,886
But she is waving at you.

952
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:42,218
Shruti!

953
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:44,182
Shruti!
- Wow!

954
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,658
You are acting as if are West
Bengal's heroine Katrina.

955
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,754
Shruti... Let's go.
- whoever sees you waves at you!

956
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:50,588
Come let's go to her.

957
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,297
No Master. She is waving at you.

958
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,031
Don't know how many and where
all you have your followers.

959
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,708
Hey, Shruti, I called you so
many times, don't you hear me?

960
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,645
I cannot even imagine
I will meet you here.

961
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,341
When did you come here?
I came yesterday.

962
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,915
Her sister's home is...

963
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,211
Oh, he's my husband, Amit.

964
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,288
How are you?

965
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,221
Sorry!
Who are you?

966
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,791
Now again you are up to
your old games?

967
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:23,030
She is always like that. She puts
you in such an awkward position...

968
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,333
There was no girl in our batch...

969
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,298
...who she did not harass like this.

970
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:28,500
Hey?

971
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:31,128
I think you are making some
mistake. I really don't recon you.

972
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,440
Shruti, now you will get
a beating.

973
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,337
Come, sit with us and
let's have a chat.

974
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,639
Did not I tell you I don't know you.
Why are you forcing me?

975
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,882
Go away, don't disturb me.

976
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,375
Shruti, I am Sujata.

977
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,615
Don't you have anything
in your head?

978
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,389
Since when I am telling you
that I don't know you...

979
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,720
...even than you don't understand.

980
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:54,493
Why are you behaving like this
with me?

981
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,799
What... What's wrong with you?

982
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,435
Are you afraid of talking to me
before these guys?

983
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:05,335
Why would I be afraid?
They all are my friends.

984
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,533
And I have neither seen your
nor do I recongnize your.

985
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,845
Perhaps you are mistaken
somehow.

986
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,171
Impossible.

987
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:14,644
Shruti, was my best friend
in the college.

988
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,748
We studied together for
three years.

989
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,817
And I won't recongnize my friend?

990
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:21,178
Sujata.

991
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:23,791
If she is not able to really
recongnize your...

992
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,084
...then don't bother.

993
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,794
There is no need to talk to her.
Let's go. - Amit!

994
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,991
Shruti, you did not act right.

995
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,325
Insulted me before everyone.

996
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,058
Come.

997
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:36,860
Come on.

998
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:46,736
Sit.

999
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:58,658
Hey, why have you stopped.
Continue eating, please.

1000
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,525
Had something gone wrong
between you two?

1001
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,835
But it did not appear that
she was lying.

1002
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,458
Oh!

1003
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,036
So you too aren't believing me?

1004
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,440
Shruti! Shruti!

1005
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:53,110
Welcome, madam.

1006
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,613
Is your anger subsided
or you are still with it.

1007
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:01,411
Sorry.

1008
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:04,418
Due to me your enjoyment
was hampered.

1009
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:08,691
Instead of shouting at her you could
have nicely replied to that girl.

1010
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:12,159
I could not control my temper.

1011
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:15,403
I am with such kind of
pain since long time.

1012
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:16,960
What pain?

1013
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,605
What kind of pain?
- My father.

1014
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:29,009
Everyone is scared from the
name of Amit De Roy, in Kolkata.

1015
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,251
Murdering someone,
thrashing and mauling someone...

1016
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,388
...it's nothing to him.

1017
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:38,421
He has no value for
any human life.

1018
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:41,220
Seeing all this since childhood...

1019
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:44,492
...I devolped a hatred.

1020
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:48,936
Only what I like was my mother.

1021
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:51,570
My mother loved me a lot.

1022
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:55,304
Papa, also troubled my mother a lot.

1023
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:58,541
I may not be troubled...

1024
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,579
...so, my mother kept an
artificial smiling face.

1025
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:05,954
One day, me and my mother
were returning from the temple...

1026
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,824
...and I was naughtily plying
with mother...

1027
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:14,091
...and my mother was tolerating
everything smilingly.

1028
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:18,492
Then suddenly a truck appeared...

1029
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,897
...and smashed our car.

1030
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:23,670
I had a head injury.

1031
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:27,298
I had to be hospatilized for a month.

1032
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,604
And when I returned, I found...

1033
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,705
...the on the spot...

1034
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,313
...due to accident...

1035
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,978
...my past 3 year's memory was lost.

1036
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,017
I am unable to recall anything.

1037
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:45,956
And those three years
are not leaving in peace.

1038
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,791
And there, people come and ask
me to remember them.

1039
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,023
...and they say who are they?

1040
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:56,326
Hearing all that and trying to
remember, my mind used to blast.

1041
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:04,841
...I came here to Kolkata.

1042
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,946
And here too I have no peace.
The same good old question.

1043
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,880
It was better if I had
died with mother.

1044
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:21,890
Sorry, Shruti.

1045
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:24,024
I did not know it.

1046
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,034
You will get well.

1047
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:31,904
You will certainly get well.

1048
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:34,441
All the reports are here?

1049
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,635
But what's the use of all this?

1050
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:40,043
Many doctors have examined me
in Kolkata and treatment is also on.

1051
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,343
Do it for myself,
show to the doctor.

1052
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:43,506
Come.

1053
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:47,918
Come in. Hey, Obi, welcome.

1054
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,217
I was just thinking about you.

1055
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:51,785
How are you?

1056
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:54,990
Shruti. Am I right?

1057
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:58,865
You're thinking how do I know you?

1058
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:03,269
This Obi, kept talking about you
yesterday night.

1059
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,033
And when did he put down
the phone, do you know?

1060
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:08,608
Morning 3.

1061
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:13,812
And in every sentence he must
have taken your name at least 4 times.

1062
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:18,920
Shruti, Shruti, Shruti, Shruti...
He did not let me sleep.

1063
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:24,784
But hearing about you yesterday,
I felt he is in a lot of tension.

1064
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:27,992
Anyway, have you brought
Medical Reports. - Yes.

1065
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:31,322
Good. Sit down.
- Come.

1066
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,038
There appears to be nothing
critical.

1067
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:43,738
Very simple case.

1068
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:46,605
You continue with the prescribed
medicine, you will be fine.

1069
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:50,250
Kolkota doctors too say the same,
that I will be fine.

1070
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:52,942
But I haven't recovered.

1071
01:19:56,958 --> 01:20:00,553
Look, forgetting is human nature.

1072
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:03,393
You have it in your throat
but can't say it.

1073
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:07,826
Reason? Those words have
slipped your memory.

1074
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:12,133
Suppose someone hit someone
from behind.

1075
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:16,306
The one who got hurt
he cried out!

1076
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,639
But for a second he could
not remember anything.

1077
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:25,779
Because, for a moment his
memory was lost.

1078
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,218
But this memory loss...

1079
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:33,818
...could not be only for
a few moments...

1080
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:36,221
Perhaps, it is for few hours...

1081
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:40,028
...or even for months
or even for few years.

1082
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:43,671
It's called post traumatic event
amnesia.

1083
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,337
Shruti, has the same condition.

1084
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:52,035
Many years from her life
are washed out.

1085
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,640
No, no. Trying to remember
will recover the memory.

1086
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:00,080
Will she be fine like before?

1087
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,952
Recover she will, but...

1088
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,160
She will be totally fine or not,
it can't be said.

1089
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,159
I did not get it?

1090
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:15,598
Suppose, Shruti get her lost
3 years' memory...

1091
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,965
...then she will lose the
memory of her present.

1092
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:23,238
Her coming here,
the people from here...

1093
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:27,339
...whatever has transpired during
this time, she will forget.

1094
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:29,543
So much so...

1095
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,251
...she will forget you too.

1096
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,364
Why are you crying, Shruti.
Doctor said you will be fine.

1097
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,437
I don't want to recover, Obi.

1098
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:31,873
If doctor has said
I will never recover...

1099
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:34,779
...then it would not have
affected me at all.

1100
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:38,410
If he said I will be dead...

1101
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:41,385
...then I would not have bothered.

1102
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,687
But he has said something
totally unacceptable, obi.

1103
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:47,987
That I may forget you.

1104
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:51,359
I cannot bear this at all.

1105
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,058
Not in any condition.

1106
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:02,040
Ok, Obi. If doctor's
prediction comes true...

1107
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:05,238
...will you leave my side, will you?

1108
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:08,038
If I am rally unable to
recognize you...

1109
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:12,212
...and tell you that I don't
recongnize you...

1110
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,814
...and ask you to go away
from my eyes...

1111
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:18,089
...even then you will not
leave me, will you?

1112
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:21,493
I don't want to recover.

1113
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,662
I don't want to be all right.

1114
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,627
I can't live without you.

1115
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:35,665
Shruti, why are you living
a feared life?

1116
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:37,874
All this time you lived under the
fear of your father...

1117
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:39,637
...and now you want to live
under the fear of doctor's say so.

1118
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:42,281
Whatever happens around you,
you are afraid of it.

1119
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:44,546
Why, Shruti? Why?

1120
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:47,085
Don't you trust that I will be
with you all your life?

1121
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:51,522
Shruti, when first time I saw
you at the Railway Station...

1122
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,751
...that very day my heart
said that you are the only one for me.

1123
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:57,788
And you will be mine
till the last breathe.

1124
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:00,024
Nobody can take you
away from me.

1125
01:24:18,889 --> 01:24:21,619
Hey, leaving everything else
are you driving?

1126
01:24:21,926 --> 01:24:22,756
Be quick.

1127
01:24:22,827 --> 01:24:24,522
What else should I do? What?

1128
01:24:24,728 --> 01:24:27,094
The car only comes out once
every six months.

1129
01:24:27,465 --> 01:24:30,025
I am practicing driving
so that I may not forget driving.

1130
01:24:30,334 --> 01:24:31,596
What I am doing, huh!

1131
01:24:32,136 --> 01:24:34,036
Obi, are you listening,
I am Shruti speaking.

1132
01:24:34,638 --> 01:24:36,731
Obi, are you listening,
I am Shruti speaking.

1133
01:24:37,241 --> 01:24:39,232
Obi, are you listening,
I am Shruti speaking.

1134
01:24:39,777 --> 01:24:41,870
Obi, are you listening,
I am Shruti speaking.

1135
01:24:42,246 --> 01:24:44,339
Obi, are you listening,
I am Shruti speaking.

1136
01:24:45,216 --> 01:24:46,205
Yes.

1137
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,380
Ok, fine I will be there.

1138
01:24:51,255 --> 01:24:54,383
Obi, who called?

1139
01:24:54,558 --> 01:24:55,582
Your aunt.

1140
01:25:01,132 --> 01:25:02,121
Mother.

1141
01:25:02,233 --> 01:25:03,257
Will you have tea?

1142
01:25:04,201 --> 01:25:05,566
I want to tell you something.

1143
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:08,603
My cooking isn't done yet,
go and talk to your father.

1144
01:25:09,507 --> 01:25:11,304
It can't be told to father, Mother.

1145
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:15,340
I am making fish curry,
will you eat?

1146
01:25:15,513 --> 01:25:17,105
I will see about
it in the afternoon.

1147
01:25:17,281 --> 01:25:19,044
What I am saying now
first listen to it.

1148
01:25:19,116 --> 01:25:21,812
What will you have now,
fried flat bread or the puffed one.

1149
01:25:22,153 --> 01:25:23,085
Look.

1150
01:25:23,187 --> 01:25:26,486
I want to talk something important
and you're talking about others things.

1151
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:28,887
Okay, tell me what it is?

1152
01:25:29,693 --> 01:25:30,682
Mother.

1153
01:25:31,695 --> 01:25:32,684
I am in love.

1154
01:25:33,364 --> 01:25:35,093
You are in love!

1155
01:25:38,002 --> 01:25:40,470
Hey, what happens,
bring the dough quickly.

1156
01:25:41,972 --> 01:25:42,961
Mother.

1157
01:25:44,141 --> 01:25:46,541
Mother, you...
- Hey, be careful, it will fall.

1158
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:47,975
Mother I am telling you something...

1159
01:25:48,045 --> 01:25:49,808
Hey, why don't you tell me,
I have nothing to do.

1160
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,245
If nothing to do then
go and do something.

1161
01:25:51,348 --> 01:25:53,179
Hey, listen, listen...
- Yeah, go ahead.

1162
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:54,749
Go give this tea to
his father.

1163
01:25:54,852 --> 01:25:56,114
Now, go get to work.

1164
01:25:56,754 --> 01:25:57,743
All right.

1165
01:25:57,955 --> 01:25:58,944
'All right! '.

1166
01:26:04,995 --> 01:26:05,984
Mother listen.

1167
01:26:06,463 --> 01:26:07,589
She is very good.

1168
01:26:07,932 --> 01:26:10,332
Learned, knows to cook
and also very beautiful.

1169
01:26:10,968 --> 01:26:12,833
Exactly like you wished.

1170
01:26:13,537 --> 01:26:15,334
Oh, is it so?
Tell me who's she?

1171
01:26:18,309 --> 01:26:19,298
Shruti.

1172
01:26:21,078 --> 01:26:22,807
Oh, the same fair girl?

1173
01:26:23,247 --> 01:26:24,839
The one at Binoy Roy's home?

1174
01:26:25,416 --> 01:26:28,044
Hey, is sugar right in your tea?

1175
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,688
Have I mistakenly told somebody
else's name instead of Shruti?

1176
01:26:32,056 --> 01:26:33,489
Or am unable to explain?

1177
01:26:34,491 --> 01:26:35,719
No reaction.

1178
01:26:35,993 --> 01:26:37,654
Hey, brother's tea you are having?

1179
01:26:37,761 --> 01:26:38,989
Because beetle leaves are
in his mouth.

1180
01:26:39,063 --> 01:26:40,428
Mother, I'm talking to you about
such an important matter...

1181
01:26:40,497 --> 01:26:41,759
...and your not giving any
heed to it?

1182
01:26:41,865 --> 01:26:42,832
I know.

1183
01:26:42,933 --> 01:26:45,094
You love Shruti and
Shruti loves you. - Mother.

1184
01:26:45,236 --> 01:26:46,328
That's the end of the matter.

1185
01:26:47,071 --> 01:26:47,935
Aunty.

1186
01:26:48,005 --> 01:26:50,667
Fish curry and mutton,
is very testy.

1187
01:26:50,975 --> 01:26:52,499
Hey, when did you guys come?
- Very early morning.

1188
01:26:52,676 --> 01:26:54,507
We came to narrate your
love story to aunt.

1189
01:26:54,678 --> 01:26:56,578
So aunt did not let leave
without it.

1190
01:26:56,714 --> 01:26:58,511
Gosh, if the trailor has such that
then what will full movie have!

1191
01:26:58,616 --> 01:27:00,880
Narrating your love story would
entail treats for a month.

1192
01:27:00,951 --> 01:27:03,078
Isn't it? - Hold on,
I am gonna give you a treat.

1193
01:27:03,187 --> 01:27:04,654
Hey, what are you doing?
- Stop!

1194
01:27:04,888 --> 01:27:06,378
Look, those boys' naughtyness.

1195
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:09,318
Reading morning newspapers
to bring headaches.

1196
01:27:09,627 --> 01:27:11,356
What will become of this nation?
- How are yo.

1197
01:27:11,495 --> 01:27:13,053
Look, the same news again.

1198
01:27:13,197 --> 01:27:15,427
Hey, Indranath Babu you!

1199
01:27:15,499 --> 01:27:17,660
Today your walking style has
changed completely?

1200
01:27:17,735 --> 01:27:19,225
Because there is good news.

1201
01:27:19,303 --> 01:27:20,292
What?

1202
01:27:20,604 --> 01:27:22,162
Obi is in love.

1203
01:27:22,306 --> 01:27:23,637
Really? - Yeah!

1204
01:27:24,475 --> 01:27:25,669
Hey, Debu!
- Yes, sir.

1205
01:27:25,909 --> 01:27:28,241
It's your responsibility to arrange
everything for Obi's marriage.

1206
01:27:28,412 --> 01:27:29,276
Obi's wedding?

1207
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:30,369
Don't you know?

1208
01:27:30,681 --> 01:27:32,148
Obi, is in love.

1209
01:27:32,216 --> 01:27:33,183
With whom?

1210
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:35,946
The girl who is at Vinu's home
with her.

1211
01:27:36,153 --> 01:27:39,418
Listen, you will supply everything
needed for Obi's wedding.

1212
01:27:39,723 --> 01:27:40,781
All right, sir.
- And you...

1213
01:27:40,924 --> 01:27:42,824
...all the flower arrangements
will go from your shop.

1214
01:27:43,027 --> 01:27:44,892
Want to go to that shop
or this? - This one.

1215
01:27:44,995 --> 01:27:46,462
Okay, in that?
Okay, let's go.

1216
01:27:47,665 --> 01:27:49,132
Give me some green chiles.
- Hey...

1217
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:51,233
Look, the girl there is...

1218
01:27:51,402 --> 01:27:53,529
...will be the wife of our Obi.

1219
01:27:53,604 --> 01:27:57,040
Oh yeah? Really, she is very
beautiful looking.

1220
01:27:58,008 --> 01:28:00,533
Hey, miss!
Will you come here?

1221
01:28:01,712 --> 01:28:02,701
Come on, come.

1222
01:28:03,914 --> 01:28:04,938
Please come.

1223
01:28:07,084 --> 01:28:08,984
Give your bag. Please.
- Give me.

1224
01:28:09,953 --> 01:28:11,580
Fill it up, fill it up.
Here take it.

1225
01:28:11,889 --> 01:28:12,787
So much?

1226
01:28:12,856 --> 01:28:14,756
Hey, don't give me so much,
I haven't the money.

1227
01:28:14,825 --> 01:28:16,793
Who is asking for money?

1228
01:28:16,894 --> 01:28:19,124
You the future daughter-in-law
of our elder brother.

1229
01:28:19,296 --> 01:28:21,560
So it's our blessing it advance.

1230
01:28:22,066 --> 01:28:23,897
May God lavish with everything,
daughter.

1231
01:28:23,967 --> 01:28:25,901
Our Obi's bride is so very
beautiful.

1232
01:28:26,103 --> 01:28:28,230
Both of you will make
a handsome couple.

1233
01:28:28,305 --> 01:28:30,899
Listen, I too would made
beautiful couple...

1234
01:28:31,075 --> 01:28:32,770
...just because my nose
is bit flat that's why...

1235
01:28:32,843 --> 01:28:34,743
...Obi never look at me seriously.

1236
01:28:35,546 --> 01:28:36,945
Now don't poke your nose here.

1237
01:28:37,014 --> 01:28:39,812
What's your comparison between
you and Obi's to be bride?

1238
01:28:40,317 --> 01:28:42,683
Now let it be, we don't want to
talk about is much in the market.

1239
01:28:42,753 --> 01:28:44,914
Let it be,
you need not say anything.

1240
01:28:46,123 --> 01:28:48,921
Keep an eye on Obi.

1241
01:28:49,993 --> 01:28:50,982
I will.

1242
01:28:51,428 --> 01:28:53,658
Let's go.
- Now weight my vegetables.

1243
01:28:53,797 --> 01:28:55,458
Chiles... Hey, sister!

1244
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:58,464
Sir had come to the market,
he has advanced everyone.

1245
01:28:58,569 --> 01:28:59,399
What advance?

1246
01:28:59,470 --> 01:29:01,495
Hey, advances for your
wedding arrangements.

1247
01:29:01,805 --> 01:29:04,137
Sister, you will see my dash
on your wedding day.

1248
01:29:04,308 --> 01:29:05,366
Will put on a shirt that day?

1249
01:29:05,509 --> 01:29:07,807
How can I, I have taken vow.

1250
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:10,571
As long as I don't thrash
the guy who hit Obi...

1251
01:29:10,748 --> 01:29:12,375
I will not be able to wear
the shirt.

1252
01:29:12,616 --> 01:29:14,379
On the day of wedding you will
know, who hit him.

1253
01:29:14,518 --> 01:29:15,507
Let's go.

1254
01:29:17,121 --> 01:29:18,213
What did she say?

1255
01:29:19,056 --> 01:29:21,081
Are you really marrying Obida?

1256
01:29:22,393 --> 01:29:24,691
I thought I would make
passes at you...

1257
01:29:25,629 --> 01:29:27,597
You are such a naughty
kid I did not know?

1258
01:29:27,798 --> 01:29:29,129
I will not spare you today,
hold on.

1259
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:32,166
Hey, stop! Where are you going?

1260
01:29:35,205 --> 01:29:36,433
Can't you see your way?

1261
01:29:36,874 --> 01:29:39,365
Why are you staring,
I know I am beautiful.

1262
01:29:41,145 --> 01:29:43,113
Are the Phoolwadi's guys
are after me just for nothing?

1263
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,238
It's quality, boss.

1264
01:29:45,416 --> 01:29:46,440
Oh, is that so?
- Yeah.

1265
01:29:51,522 --> 01:29:52,784
You are getting to hyper about
all this.

1266
01:29:52,923 --> 01:29:54,686
What you don't understand
don't talk about it.

1267
01:29:55,058 --> 01:29:56,685
I don't want that something
goes wrong here.

1268
01:29:56,927 --> 01:29:57,916
Shruti!

1269
01:30:00,798 --> 01:30:01,787
Don't worry.

1270
01:30:03,133 --> 01:30:03,861
What's it Vinuda!

1271
01:30:03,934 --> 01:30:06,903
You better pack your stuff,
I will drop you home.

1272
01:30:07,337 --> 01:30:08,565
Did my father call?

1273
01:30:09,373 --> 01:30:10,237
No.

1274
01:30:10,307 --> 01:30:11,035
Then?

1275
01:30:11,141 --> 01:30:12,802
When I was working for
your father...

1276
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:15,574
...there was not a day
when I did not see a murder.

1277
01:30:16,947 --> 01:30:20,110
I was suffocated seeing blood
and bodies.

1278
01:30:21,084 --> 01:30:22,381
So a ran and came
back here.

1279
01:30:23,353 --> 01:30:25,184
I won't like to see the
same blood and gore again.

1280
01:30:25,889 --> 01:30:26,878
You leave from here.

1281
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:28,949
No. I will not go.

1282
01:30:29,059 --> 01:30:30,026
I beg you.
- Vinuda.

1283
01:30:30,127 --> 01:30:31,287
Have you lost you mind.

1284
01:30:31,395 --> 01:30:33,625
Your begging to such a
young kid? - You keep quiet.

1285
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,231
I have brought you up
since childhood...

1286
01:30:39,169 --> 01:30:41,899
...your happiness is my happiness.

1287
01:30:42,473 --> 01:30:45,203
So why are you asking
me to leave?

1288
01:30:46,176 --> 01:30:47,837
Don't you wish that
I love Obi?

1289
01:30:47,911 --> 01:30:49,776
If you were my daughter...

1290
01:30:50,514 --> 01:30:51,913
...then I would have said...

1291
01:30:52,249 --> 01:30:53,739
...that I must have prayed hard...

1292
01:30:54,184 --> 01:30:55,845
...so I got someone like you.

1293
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:58,615
But your are Agnidev Roy's
daughter.

1294
01:30:59,556 --> 01:31:01,023
If you leave from here...

1295
01:31:01,225 --> 01:31:03,955
...it will be better for you
and Obi as well.

1296
01:31:04,595 --> 01:31:06,563
I beg you with folded hands...

1297
01:31:07,865 --> 01:31:08,854
You leave!

1298
01:31:14,838 --> 01:31:17,033
You forget what he said.
He's unnecessarily scaring you.

1299
01:31:22,779 --> 01:31:24,542
You love Obi, yeah?

1300
01:31:25,115 --> 01:31:25,945
Sis-in-law!

1301
01:31:26,016 --> 01:31:27,950
You won't go back,
due to your father's fear?

1302
01:31:29,453 --> 01:31:31,148
Obi really loves your so much.

1303
01:31:31,455 --> 01:31:32,945
Don't deceive him.

1304
01:31:51,241 --> 01:31:52,765
Oh, wow!

1305
01:31:54,311 --> 01:31:55,608
Is it my room?

1306
01:32:19,703 --> 01:32:20,965
Who's in the bathroom?

1307
01:32:21,271 --> 01:32:22,135
Me.

1308
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:23,228
Doomed!

1309
01:32:24,074 --> 01:32:25,507
Why are you in my bathroom?

1310
01:32:25,742 --> 01:32:27,039
Why, can't I?

1311
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:28,407
No, no.
Of course you can.

1312
01:32:28,779 --> 01:32:31,270
As you will be staying here,
bedroom, bathroom everything is yours.

1313
01:32:32,449 --> 01:32:33,780
Have you made up this room?

1314
01:32:34,151 --> 01:32:34,947
Yeah.

1315
01:32:35,018 --> 01:32:38,146
As I have to stay here, I've made
it worth living for human being.

1316
01:32:38,488 --> 01:32:40,012
Why, don't human beings stay here?

1317
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:41,079
No.

1318
01:33:39,349 --> 01:33:40,373
How do you feel?

1319
01:33:43,253 --> 01:33:44,151
Excellent.

1320
01:33:44,221 --> 01:33:45,210
Not the room.

1321
01:33:46,623 --> 01:33:47,612
Me?

1322
01:33:48,325 --> 01:33:51,852
If you ask such a question
I won't be able to control myself.

1323
01:33:52,663 --> 01:33:53,755
I would make mistake.

1324
01:33:55,932 --> 01:33:57,593
What? Make mistake?

1325
01:34:02,339 --> 01:34:04,136
Hey, Shruti!
What are you up to?

1326
01:34:05,809 --> 01:34:08,209
Then, let's commit mistake.

1327
01:34:08,345 --> 01:34:10,210
You are saying, as if
your are offering tea or coffee.

1328
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:13,144
Hey. Just tell me whether
you'll commit mistake or not?

1329
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:15,818
Hey, don't joke about it.
Okay?

1330
01:34:15,986 --> 01:34:17,146
Who is joking with you?

1331
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:18,847
Hey, stop, stop, stop!

1332
01:34:21,191 --> 01:34:22,385
This is the border line.

1333
01:34:22,526 --> 01:34:25,154
You won't cross this
and I will not... cross...

1334
01:34:25,262 --> 01:34:26,559
You talk too much.

1335
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:28,154
Shruti, Shruti...
- You should be...

1336
01:34:28,365 --> 01:34:30,697
Shruti, I will shout now...

1337
01:34:30,801 --> 01:34:32,530
Oh! Then go ahead!

1338
01:34:33,203 --> 01:34:34,192
One...

1339
01:34:35,172 --> 01:34:36,264
Two...

1340
01:34:38,008 --> 01:34:39,032
Three...

1341
01:35:49,012 --> 01:35:50,138
What happened, Shruti?

1342
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:02,280
Shruti...

1343
01:36:03,393 --> 01:36:04,553
Why are you crying?

1344
01:36:07,464 --> 01:36:08,590
Will you tell me what it is?

1345
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,093
Everything will be destroyed, Obi.

1346
01:36:13,303 --> 01:36:16,397
Doctor says, I will forget you.

1347
01:36:17,874 --> 01:36:19,671
Vinuda, is asking me to leave
and go.

1348
01:36:21,478 --> 01:36:22,968
I am scared, Obi.

1349
01:36:27,384 --> 01:36:29,045
Don't you trust me?

1350
01:36:29,486 --> 01:36:31,010
I don't even trust myself.

1351
01:36:32,122 --> 01:36:33,851
It will be better if I really
forget you.

1352
01:36:34,558 --> 01:36:35,547
So...

1353
01:36:35,692 --> 01:36:36,681
Shruti...

1354
01:36:36,827 --> 01:36:38,522
I want a child form you.

1355
01:36:38,795 --> 01:36:40,057
What nonsense is this?

1356
01:36:41,064 --> 01:36:42,793
Will everything be fine
after a child?

1357
01:36:43,166 --> 01:36:45,100
What doctors say, that always
is not right.

1358
01:36:46,937 --> 01:36:49,405
My only truth is that you love me
and I love you.

1359
01:36:50,473 --> 01:36:52,964
Shruti, trusting me you are
willing to surrender everything...

1360
01:36:53,543 --> 01:36:55,170
...so how can I leave
you alone, tell me?

1361
01:36:55,912 --> 01:36:59,143
Shruti, even if you forget me,
won't recognize and shoo me away...

1362
01:36:59,516 --> 01:37:00,642
...even then I won't forget you.

1363
01:37:01,084 --> 01:37:02,278
Have faith.

1364
01:37:02,652 --> 01:37:04,517
I have complete faith in you.

1365
01:37:05,088 --> 01:37:06,350
But my father...

1366
01:37:06,923 --> 01:37:09,050
Thinking about him itself
gives me jitters.

1367
01:37:09,125 --> 01:37:10,888
What fear, Shruti?
Fear of what?

1368
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:16,690
Here, talk to your father.
I will talk to him.

1369
01:37:17,267 --> 01:37:18,256
Call him.

1370
01:37:26,276 --> 01:37:28,107
I don't know anything, sir.

1371
01:37:28,478 --> 01:37:29,467
Please let me off.

1372
01:37:29,913 --> 01:37:30,937
Boss.

1373
01:37:31,481 --> 01:37:32,743
Younger sister's call.

1374
01:37:35,886 --> 01:37:37,410
Give him good treatment.

1375
01:37:38,255 --> 01:37:39,722
Your time will pass well.

1376
01:37:43,393 --> 01:37:45,224
Hello dear, Shruti.
How are you?

1377
01:37:45,495 --> 01:37:47,759
Not Shruti, I am Obi here.

1378
01:37:48,565 --> 01:37:49,554
Vinuda's neighbour.

1379
01:37:49,633 --> 01:37:50,622
Speak.

1380
01:37:51,034 --> 01:37:52,695
How is Shruti?
- She is fine.

1381
01:37:54,004 --> 01:37:55,835
I want to talk something
important to you.

1382
01:37:56,139 --> 01:37:57,128
Yes, speak.

1383
01:37:57,774 --> 01:37:59,901
I and Shruti love each other.

1384
01:38:01,978 --> 01:38:03,775
Tomorrow I am coming to
Kolkata to talk to you.

1385
01:38:05,982 --> 01:38:06,971
No.

1386
01:38:08,218 --> 01:38:09,549
You need not come here.

1387
01:38:10,253 --> 01:38:12,448
I am coming there.
We'll talk face to face.

1388
01:38:16,293 --> 01:38:17,555
Swine!

1389
01:38:22,198 --> 01:38:23,665
Sir, may I go?

1390
01:38:28,405 --> 01:38:30,930
Hey, have you seen Obi?
- No I haven't.

1391
01:38:33,944 --> 01:38:36,435
Hey, Where is Obi?
- I don't know.

1392
01:38:41,351 --> 01:38:42,318
Obi!

1393
01:38:42,385 --> 01:38:44,182
Hey, Vinu, what happened?

1394
01:38:44,721 --> 01:38:46,382
Is Obi at home?
I have something important.

1395
01:38:46,556 --> 01:38:47,420
Why, what's it?

1396
01:38:47,524 --> 01:38:49,617
Obi, called Shruti's father
last evening.

1397
01:38:49,726 --> 01:38:51,091
He has come here.
- Yes, I know.

1398
01:38:51,695 --> 01:38:53,526
Obi has gone to meet him
to Siliguri.

1399
01:38:58,268 --> 01:38:59,530
What's wrong with you mind...

1400
01:38:59,736 --> 01:39:01,465
...that you are going to meet
with Agnida?

1401
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:03,363
This guy is very dangerous.

1402
01:39:03,606 --> 01:39:06,268
I called my cousin in Kolkat
and came to know...

1403
01:39:06,376 --> 01:39:07,707
...that he is a big mafia.

1404
01:39:07,777 --> 01:39:09,711
Whenever he wishes
he spreads bodies.

1405
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,645
Do you see guys following
on the bike behind?

1406
01:39:12,015 --> 01:39:12,947
They aren't locals.

1407
01:39:13,149 --> 01:39:15,549
Yes, they are following us
since long.

1408
01:39:16,186 --> 01:39:19,815
Obi, let's go back and ask
Shruti's father to come your home.

1409
01:39:31,768 --> 01:39:32,757
Who is Obi?

1410
01:39:33,169 --> 01:39:33,897
I am.

1411
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:34,959
Come.

1412
01:39:37,173 --> 01:39:38,162
You come alone.

1413
01:39:59,963 --> 01:40:01,897
Boss, he's here.

1414
01:40:03,767 --> 01:40:04,756
Hi!

1415
01:40:19,249 --> 01:40:20,511
Hello, I am dada speaking.

1416
01:40:21,451 --> 01:40:22,076
Yes, dada?

1417
01:40:22,152 --> 01:40:24,518
I sent Shruti to your place
so that she feels better.

1418
01:40:26,022 --> 01:40:27,546
But I did not know she
will be so much better.

1419
01:40:27,824 --> 01:40:29,724
No, no...
dada, it's nothing like that.

1420
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:32,121
You have forgotten old days,
haven't you?

1421
01:40:32,328 --> 01:40:33,317
Why are you saying that?

1422
01:40:33,596 --> 01:40:35,757
Whatever I am today,
it's all give by you.

1423
01:40:35,932 --> 01:40:37,900
I have not mercy and
sympathy, Vinu.

1424
01:40:39,536 --> 01:40:41,163
I nursed a street dog.

1425
01:40:42,972 --> 01:40:44,496
That was my biggest fault.

1426
01:40:45,842 --> 01:40:47,469
Kindly forgive me, sir.

1427
01:40:47,811 --> 01:40:49,142
I did not know anything about it.

1428
01:40:49,512 --> 01:40:51,002
Ask Shruti be ready.

1429
01:40:54,851 --> 01:40:55,875
The flight is at 3.30.

1430
01:40:59,289 --> 01:41:00,551
I am going to fetch her.

1431
01:41:04,961 --> 01:41:05,950
So then?

1432
01:41:20,243 --> 01:41:22,575
You went round about
and said what you wanted to.

1433
01:41:22,912 --> 01:41:26,211
Now it's my turn.
I will say it in one sentence.

1434
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:31,116
Shruti will take a flight at 3.30
or bid your goodbye...

1435
01:41:31,321 --> 01:41:34,586
...it will be decided by her
to be hubby.

1436
01:41:35,425 --> 01:41:36,949
Not her father.

1437
01:41:43,766 --> 01:41:45,495
Boss, should I finish him?

1438
01:41:46,769 --> 01:41:47,758
No.

1439
01:41:48,438 --> 01:41:50,099
When I go in the flight
with Shruti...

1440
01:41:51,274 --> 01:41:52,263
...after that.

1441
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:09,917
Vinu!

1442
01:42:11,327 --> 01:42:12,294
Hello, sir.

1443
01:42:12,729 --> 01:42:13,889
Please come. Come in.

1444
01:42:16,499 --> 01:42:18,694
Hey, I see you have changed
your house completely.

1445
01:42:19,502 --> 01:42:20,298
No, sir.

1446
01:42:20,403 --> 01:42:22,268
I am the same as I was
with you.

1447
01:42:22,405 --> 01:42:23,167
Oh yes?

1448
01:42:23,273 --> 01:42:24,262
Greetings, sir.

1449
01:42:24,674 --> 01:42:25,971
How are you Sheela?
- Fine.

1450
01:42:26,042 --> 01:42:27,339
Are you fine?
- Yeah.

1451
01:42:28,878 --> 01:42:29,902
Where is Shruti?

1452
01:42:30,313 --> 01:42:31,337
Getting ready.

1453
01:42:33,016 --> 01:42:35,348
Father, I am going to
play cricket.

1454
01:42:35,785 --> 01:42:36,774
May I go?

1455
01:42:39,756 --> 01:42:40,586
What grade?

1456
01:42:40,657 --> 01:42:41,624
Plus one.

1457
01:42:41,691 --> 01:42:42,783
How's your studies going.

1458
01:42:43,059 --> 01:42:44,526
I stand 2nd in the class.

1459
01:42:44,727 --> 01:42:46,854
Wow! Very good! Very Good!

1460
01:42:47,297 --> 01:42:48,958
Here, buy some chocolate.

1461
01:42:51,601 --> 01:42:53,899
And how is your business going?

1462
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:55,767
With your blessing it's
doing fine.

1463
01:42:57,707 --> 01:42:59,800
Only being busy in your work
will work?

1464
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:02,301
Got a family, take care
of them too.

1465
01:43:07,884 --> 01:43:09,010
...they will be on the street.

1466
01:43:18,561 --> 01:43:20,722
Let's go.
Live happily.

1467
01:43:25,335 --> 01:43:26,893
Her mother talked about
you a lot.

1468
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:29,261
She also wanted to come here
and see you.

1469
01:43:30,073 --> 01:43:31,301
But in that accident...

1470
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:34,172
No one can say when
death calls.

1471
01:43:34,911 --> 01:43:35,900
No one knows.

1472
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:38,504
Let it be, come to Kolkata
with uour family.

1473
01:43:38,748 --> 01:43:39,737
Yes, I will.

1474
01:43:40,116 --> 01:43:41,105
Come.
- Father.

1475
01:43:42,185 --> 01:43:44,050
May I go and meet my
friends once?

1476
01:43:47,357 --> 01:43:48,346
Go.

1477
01:43:48,725 --> 01:43:50,090
Or you'll feel bad.

1478
01:43:59,936 --> 01:44:03,531
Chewing beetle leaves of
the Phoolwadi...

1479
01:44:03,606 --> 01:44:04,732
Hey!

1480
01:44:05,241 --> 01:44:06,230
Listen.

1481
01:44:06,909 --> 01:44:08,001
What is it?
- Give me.

1482
01:44:08,978 --> 01:44:10,002
What will you do with it?

1483
01:44:10,446 --> 01:44:11,435
Chew, what more?

1484
01:44:11,914 --> 01:44:13,711
It's laced with tobacco,
that too very powerful.

1485
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:16,444
You will get such a kick
that you will be flat.

1486
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,620
The kick I've got,
what could be more than that?

1487
01:44:21,024 --> 01:44:22,013
Go.

1488
01:44:30,767 --> 01:44:32,997
Shruti, you haven't left yet?

1489
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,003
Go, go. You will be late.

1490
01:44:36,172 --> 01:44:37,161
What's it, Obi?

1491
01:44:37,407 --> 01:44:39,671
My father has come to take
me, I am going.

1492
01:44:40,443 --> 01:44:41,432
Won't you say anything?

1493
01:44:42,879 --> 01:44:43,868
Go carefully.

1494
01:44:44,247 --> 01:44:45,544
Why don't you understand?

1495
01:44:46,182 --> 01:44:48,241
Once I am gone,
I won't be come back again.

1496
01:44:49,018 --> 01:44:51,851
You don't know my father,
once he decides he does that.

1497
01:44:56,426 --> 01:44:58,121
And your father does not
know me.

1498
01:44:59,195 --> 01:45:00,787
Once I decide something...

1499
01:45:02,799 --> 01:45:03,788
...I do the same.

1500
01:45:05,268 --> 01:45:06,496
Do you trust me?

1501
01:45:08,137 --> 01:45:10,332
I promise, if your father
does not let you off...

1502
01:45:11,107 --> 01:45:12,233
...then I will kidnap you.

1503
01:45:14,277 --> 01:45:15,835
Go, he is waiting for you.

1504
01:45:34,163 --> 01:45:35,596
Move to airport, quick.

1505
01:45:44,474 --> 01:45:46,237
Stop, stop.

1506
01:45:48,311 --> 01:45:49,300
Who is he?

1507
01:45:50,747 --> 01:45:51,736
Obi's father.

1508
01:45:56,386 --> 01:45:57,375
Hello.

1509
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:58,684
Your good, aren't you?

1510
01:45:58,788 --> 01:46:01,916
Having stopped the car in the middle
of the street, to show affection?

1511
01:46:04,127 --> 01:46:05,890
Your daughter is
my to be daughter-in-law.

1512
01:46:06,596 --> 01:46:08,359
It won't look nice if you
left without meeting.

1513
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:12,292
If you aren't in hurry,
let's finalize everything now.

1514
01:46:12,802 --> 01:46:15,236
What finalization,
What talks?

1515
01:46:15,505 --> 01:46:18,440
About their wedding.
They love each other a lot.

1516
01:46:19,242 --> 01:46:21,870
As it is I have already accepted
you daughter as my daughter-in-law.

1517
01:46:21,944 --> 01:46:25,038
So you will decide where my
daughter will marry or not?

1518
01:46:25,715 --> 01:46:27,182
You are aged so I will spare you.

1519
01:46:27,817 --> 01:46:29,512
Otherwise I would have
shredded you here and here only.

1520
01:46:29,752 --> 01:46:31,014
Of course I am aged...

1521
01:46:31,554 --> 01:46:33,988
...yet my heat is leaping
with happiness.

1522
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:36,884
And you, despite being younger,
are so hotheaded?

1523
01:46:37,026 --> 01:46:38,357
I am still cool.

1524
01:46:41,464 --> 01:46:43,989
But once again if you talked
about my daughters' wedding...

1525
01:46:44,434 --> 01:46:47,096
...then I will bury you and
your son here itself.

1526
01:47:14,230 --> 01:47:16,790
Merely holding my collar
has brought so many people...

1527
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:18,826
...luckily it did not tear.

1528
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,466
Sir, don't show off here.

1529
01:47:21,704 --> 01:47:23,467
This place is maternity home
of goons.

1530
01:47:23,706 --> 01:47:26,800
Everyday it gives birth to a
few goons and supply to Kolkata.

1531
01:47:28,144 --> 01:47:30,669
Give way, give way.

1532
01:47:31,247 --> 01:47:33,112
What has happened.
Why is the crowd?

1533
01:47:33,316 --> 01:47:34,749
Isn't father talking to him?
- Obi!

1534
01:47:34,951 --> 01:47:36,316
That man held uncle's collar.

1535
01:47:36,519 --> 01:47:37,747
I will cut his hand and throw away.

1536
01:47:39,989 --> 01:47:40,978
Obi.

1537
01:47:42,592 --> 01:47:43,581
Ask them to leave.

1538
01:47:44,126 --> 01:47:45,115
Come on, let's go.

1539
01:47:45,495 --> 01:47:46,792
Come guys, move. Leave.

1540
01:47:47,363 --> 01:47:48,489
Come go, everyone leave.

1541
01:47:48,598 --> 01:47:50,498
Come go, away. Move.

1542
01:47:50,766 --> 01:47:52,666
Go all of you.

1543
01:47:54,504 --> 01:47:56,199
Alliances are not decided
on the street.

1544
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,871
You go to Vinu's home...

1545
01:47:59,242 --> 01:48:02,177
...and I will come with my wife
to bless your daughter.

1546
01:48:21,998 --> 01:48:22,987
Boss.

1547
01:48:23,399 --> 01:48:25,526
What will you say, rascal?

1548
01:48:25,735 --> 01:48:28,033
Here the folks respect
Mr. Indernath, a lot.

1549
01:48:28,604 --> 01:48:30,003
As long as wedding does
not take place...

1550
01:48:30,072 --> 01:48:31,733
...you and Shruti
won't be able to leave here.

1551
01:48:32,008 --> 01:48:33,441
Swine!

1552
01:48:33,709 --> 01:48:34,698
Just one hour...

1553
01:48:35,912 --> 01:48:38,107
Within an hour I will show
who am I.

1554
01:48:54,397 --> 01:48:55,796
Boss, have you taken the flight?

1555
01:48:55,865 --> 01:48:58,299
Don't ask anything
Just listen what I've to say.

1556
01:48:58,534 --> 01:49:00,001
I am held in this house.

1557
01:49:00,469 --> 01:49:03,529
What's my standing I will
let everyone here.

1558
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:05,971
As many men you can collect
from Kolkata, bring them here.

1559
01:49:06,475 --> 01:49:08,500
Nobody from here should
be left alive.

1560
01:49:09,111 --> 01:49:11,579
By tomorrow I should see this
place as crematorium.

1561
01:49:11,681 --> 01:49:12,875
Don't you bother, boss.

1562
01:49:13,082 --> 01:49:15,710
By tomorrow morning Phoolwadi
would vanish from the map.

1563
01:49:23,426 --> 01:49:25,792
What will you have for dinner?

1564
01:50:15,578 --> 01:50:16,567
Hello, Bugga?

1565
01:50:17,213 --> 01:50:18,578
Hey, what happened,
why did not you call?

1566
01:50:18,714 --> 01:50:20,147
These guys are very dangerous.

1567
01:50:20,316 --> 01:50:23,183
Yesterday night I called for two
coaches full of men.

1568
01:50:23,419 --> 01:50:25,216
But none of them is
in one piece now.

1569
01:50:25,488 --> 01:50:26,420
Get lost!

1570
01:50:26,489 --> 01:50:29,720
At the station itself people came
started to beat them up.

1571
01:50:29,992 --> 01:50:32,256
Had no opportunity even to
take out anything from the bags.

1572
01:50:32,561 --> 01:50:34,461
They beat up, and applied
salt and pepper on tht wounds.

1573
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:36,225
They all are in agony.

1574
01:50:36,432 --> 01:50:38,093
We have beaten up so many
people in life...

1575
01:50:38,167 --> 01:50:39,828
...but we haven't been
beaten up like this.

1576
01:50:40,036 --> 01:50:42,368
Hardly a few have gained
consciousness.

1577
01:50:42,505 --> 01:50:45,099
They thoroughly beat us up
and admitted in hospital.

1578
01:50:45,174 --> 01:50:47,870
And have said, they will
bear the cost of hospital.

1579
01:50:52,014 --> 01:50:53,106
May I come in, sir?

1580
01:50:54,150 --> 01:50:55,447
Come, come.

1581
01:50:55,518 --> 01:50:57,076
Keep it here. Here.

1582
01:50:59,155 --> 01:51:01,248
Sir, these stuff belongs
to your men.

1583
01:51:02,324 --> 01:51:03,723
Take care of them, sir.

1584
01:51:03,959 --> 01:51:05,551
Can we leave now, sir?

1585
01:51:05,761 --> 01:51:07,922
We have to go to hospital
and then go home.

1586
01:51:08,164 --> 01:51:10,098
Just to enquire about
your men there.

1587
01:51:10,266 --> 01:51:12,029
Good bye, sir.
- Good bye.

1588
01:51:12,268 --> 01:51:13,257
Come let's go.

1589
01:51:31,587 --> 01:51:33,612
When will be the engagement?

1590
01:51:34,123 --> 01:51:35,112
Actually...

1591
01:51:37,526 --> 01:51:38,515
Please remain seated.

1592
01:51:39,829 --> 01:51:40,989
Greetings, bride's father, sir.

1593
01:51:41,897 --> 01:51:42,955
Don't take anything to mind.

1594
01:51:44,066 --> 01:51:45,533
What was to happen
that's over.

1595
01:51:45,901 --> 01:51:46,993
What's one's standing is...

1596
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:49,365
...this is not the time to show
that now.

1597
01:51:50,573 --> 01:51:51,562
Please come.

1598
01:51:52,141 --> 01:51:53,870
Let's bless them.

1599
01:51:55,344 --> 01:51:56,333
You can talk.

1600
01:51:57,146 --> 01:51:58,374
You happened to be the
father of he boy...

1601
01:51:59,048 --> 01:52:00,106
...who else will talk but you?

1602
01:52:01,283 --> 01:52:03,217
Had my daughter was on
my side today...

1603
01:52:03,853 --> 01:52:05,252
...then the situation would
have been quiet different.

1604
01:52:06,922 --> 01:52:08,184
It's natural for you to be angry.

1605
01:52:09,825 --> 01:52:13,488
But if a daughter grows up
and take her own decision...

1606
01:52:13,996 --> 01:52:15,861
...it certainly makes a father
feel bad about it.

1607
01:52:16,899 --> 01:52:19,163
Every fathers wishes for her
daughter to marry in a good house.

1608
01:52:20,169 --> 01:52:21,659
But we too aren't some
small fries.

1609
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,629
I have not daughter.

1610
01:52:26,909 --> 01:52:28,274
Your daughter is my daughter.

1611
01:52:30,412 --> 01:52:31,436
Sheela.

1612
01:52:35,417 --> 01:52:36,406
Come, dear.

1613
01:52:39,789 --> 01:52:42,815
You wanted your daughter's alliance
in some good home...

1614
01:52:43,559 --> 01:52:45,049
...then why not ours?

1615
01:52:46,128 --> 01:52:47,356
I promise you...

1616
01:52:48,297 --> 01:52:51,664
...I will keep her so happy that
you could not have even imagined.

1617
01:52:56,605 --> 01:52:59,267
Despite all this, if I take
my daughter away...

1618
01:53:00,209 --> 01:53:01,198
...then she certainly
will come back.

1619
01:53:03,379 --> 01:53:05,040
As she has already decided...

1620
01:53:06,248 --> 01:53:07,306
...then I won't say anything.

1621
01:53:09,985 --> 01:53:11,213
After everything is over...

1622
01:53:12,454 --> 01:53:13,443
...I will return.

1623
01:53:59,134 --> 01:54:01,864
You can say from right now
that Obi is in your hand.

1624
01:54:03,973 --> 01:54:05,463
Even when I am not with you...

1625
01:54:06,008 --> 01:54:08,033
...this ring will remind your of me.

1626
01:54:22,491 --> 01:54:24,391
Come let's again
do the same mistake.

1627
01:54:26,595 --> 01:54:29,428
You only get one chance,
had not I told you earlier?

1628
01:54:29,698 --> 01:54:31,290
Hey, Shruti, Shruti!

1629
01:55:09,138 --> 01:55:12,130
Play trumpets and play the drums.

1630
01:55:15,144 --> 01:55:18,375
On this happy occasion,
heart is dancing with delight.

1631
01:55:24,119 --> 01:55:26,883
Play trumpets and play the drums.

1632
01:55:27,122 --> 01:55:29,989
On the this happy day,
heart is dancing with delight.

1633
01:55:30,059 --> 01:55:35,861
The atmosphere is electric,
we are out to celebrate.

1634
01:55:36,065 --> 01:55:41,867
Heart, heart, heart is full of
happiness, it's going crazy.

1635
01:55:42,137 --> 01:55:48,133
Heart, heart, heart is full of
happiness, it's going crazy.

1636
01:56:12,134 --> 01:56:15,001
With just a touch of love,
heart wants to be lost.

1637
01:56:15,070 --> 01:56:18,039
And it is swaying with rhythm.

1638
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:26,946
With just a touch of love,
heart wants to be lost.

1639
01:56:27,016 --> 01:56:30,110
And it is swaying with rhythm.

1640
01:56:33,088 --> 01:56:38,822
If your deceptive mind can guess,
better guess now.

1641
01:56:39,094 --> 01:56:45,090
My heart and mind is
inebriated with your love.

1642
01:56:45,167 --> 01:56:50,935
Heart, heart, heart is full of
happiness, it's going crazy.

1643
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:57,136
Heart, heart, heart is full of
happiness, it's going crazy.

1644
01:57:34,483 --> 01:57:40,422
In the space of happiness,
my heart is dancing with your love.

1645
01:57:46,462 --> 01:57:52,401
In the space of happiness,
my heart is dancing with your love.

1646
01:57:55,571 --> 01:58:01,271
You are aware of hidden
signals of eyes.

1647
01:58:01,643 --> 01:58:07,411
The burning heart is soothed
with your sweet talks.

1648
01:58:13,188 --> 01:58:16,282
Play trumpets and play the drums.

1649
01:58:16,492 --> 01:58:19,484
On this happy occasion,
heart is dancing with delight.

1650
01:58:19,595 --> 01:58:25,363
The atmosphere is electric,
we are out to celebrate.

1651
01:58:25,534 --> 01:58:31,268
Heart, heart, heart is full of
happiness, it's going crazy.

1652
01:58:31,607 --> 01:58:37,341
Heart, heart, heart is full of
happiness, it's going crazy.

1653
01:58:37,613 --> 01:58:43,552
Heart, heart, heart is full of
happiness, it's going crazy.

1654
01:58:43,785 --> 01:58:49,587
Heart, heart, heart is full of
happiness, it's going crazy.

1655
01:58:49,658 --> 01:58:55,460
Heart, heart, heart is full of
happiness, it's going crazy.

1656
01:58:57,699 --> 01:58:59,098
What happened?

1657
01:58:59,368 --> 01:59:01,165
Vinu what's happening?

1658
01:59:01,370 --> 01:59:02,997
Hey!

1659
01:59:38,173 --> 01:59:39,800
Obi!

1660
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:44,406
Welcome, welcome.
Shruti is in the car.

1661
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:48,278
For two days you held me in the
house and treated me so well.

1662
01:59:49,284 --> 01:59:52,151
Had I left without repaying,
I would have felt so sad.

1663
01:59:53,188 --> 01:59:55,713
Hey, go.
Now go and be hospitable to them.

1664
01:59:56,191 --> 01:59:57,180
Go!

1665
02:02:30,011 --> 02:02:31,376
Obi!

1666
02:03:46,054 --> 02:03:47,043
Obi...

1667
02:04:00,235 --> 02:04:01,259
Obi!

1668
02:05:10,305 --> 02:05:12,637
'Shruti was afraid that
she will forget me.'

1669
02:05:13,642 --> 02:05:15,200
'But I gave her my word...

1670
02:05:16,044 --> 02:05:18,035
...that despite that I will not
leave her and go.'

1671
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,438
'I will keep my word.'

1672
02:05:21,483 --> 02:05:25,214
'Come what may,
I will not leave you.'

1673
02:05:48,109 --> 02:05:49,098
No!

1674
02:05:49,444 --> 02:05:50,433
Rascal!

1675
02:05:50,712 --> 02:05:53,044
Obi, escaped and you are
showing your teeth?

1676
02:05:53,548 --> 02:05:55,982
Before he leaves this area
get hold of him and kill him.

1677
02:05:56,451 --> 02:05:57,440
Go!

1678
02:05:57,752 --> 02:05:58,741
Get going!

1679
02:06:00,522 --> 02:06:02,149
Unnecessarily you are
taking tension.

1680
02:06:02,857 --> 02:06:05,087
The story of North Bengal
your daughter does not remember.

1681
02:06:05,660 --> 02:06:06,718
Not even the boy.

1682
02:06:07,462 --> 02:06:09,862
The boy will roam around
in the streets and go back home.

1683
02:06:11,266 --> 02:06:15,828
Once a man comes to the gates
of death he does not return.

1684
02:06:16,938 --> 02:06:18,132
My tension is that.

1685
02:06:18,707 --> 02:06:19,969
Everything will be fine.
- Okay, sir.

1686
02:06:20,108 --> 02:06:21,541
Good bye. - Good bye.

1687
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:29,739
Hello, Obi, speak.

1688
02:06:30,318 --> 02:06:31,307
Doctor.

1689
02:06:32,554 --> 02:06:33,919
Shruti is unable to recognize me.

1690
02:06:34,289 --> 02:06:35,278
Oh God!

1691
02:06:35,857 --> 02:06:37,381
It means she has recovered.

1692
02:06:38,193 --> 02:06:41,788
It means, she got her lost memory
and forgotten about you.

1693
02:06:43,131 --> 02:06:45,224
And the worst part is, Obi...

1694
02:06:45,834 --> 02:06:50,396
...that she may recall you
or may not.

1695
02:06:51,139 --> 02:06:52,663
It's all in the God's hands.

1696
02:07:05,186 --> 02:07:06,175
You tell me.

1697
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:10,688
Dear, go and bow in
the Narayan's Temple.

1698
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:12,385
Father?

1699
02:07:12,494 --> 02:07:13,586
Yes, dear, go.

1700
02:07:29,511 --> 02:07:30,500
Sujata?

1701
02:07:31,613 --> 02:07:32,602
Hey, Sujata!

1702
02:07:34,516 --> 02:07:35,505
Hi!

1703
02:07:36,217 --> 02:07:37,206
Let's go.

1704
02:07:39,988 --> 02:07:41,285
Other day she insulted me...

1705
02:07:41,623 --> 02:07:43,523
...and now wants to talk to me.
- Hey, hold on.

1706
02:07:44,225 --> 02:07:45,886
Hey, you're going away
despite seeing me?

1707
02:07:46,428 --> 02:07:47,622
Have pride taken you over?

1708
02:07:49,264 --> 02:07:52,199
You son has grown
up a lot.

1709
02:07:52,534 --> 02:07:53,523
I will go a bit further.

1710
02:07:55,470 --> 02:07:56,960
I had seen when he was
so small.

1711
02:07:57,605 --> 02:07:59,470
Even with you I am meeting after
a long time.

1712
02:07:59,541 --> 02:08:00,633
Tell me how are you?

1713
02:08:01,009 --> 02:08:03,603
Now pretend, you don't even
recognize when you see me.

1714
02:08:03,778 --> 02:08:05,143
What nonsense?

1715
02:08:05,647 --> 02:08:08,480
Don't you remember how badly
you insulted me in Siliguri.

1716
02:08:08,583 --> 02:08:10,847
In Suliguri and me?

1717
02:08:11,219 --> 02:08:13,881
Oh, I see.
So I have to remind you?

1718
02:08:14,656 --> 02:08:16,647
In front of everyone you
shouted and said...

1719
02:08:16,791 --> 02:08:17,917
...that you don't recognize me.

1720
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:21,290
Your behaviuour that day
made me cry.

1721
02:08:22,163 --> 02:08:24,427
You don't every talk to me again.

1722
02:08:25,133 --> 02:08:26,122
Sujata!

1723
02:08:27,669 --> 02:08:28,636
God!

1724
02:08:28,703 --> 02:08:30,330
When did I go to Siliguri?

1725
02:08:31,005 --> 02:08:31,994
Shruti.

1726
02:08:35,009 --> 02:08:36,772
Don't be afraid.

1727
02:08:37,912 --> 02:08:39,675
I just want to talk to you
something.

1728
02:08:40,415 --> 02:08:41,404
Hey, Shruti.

1729
02:08:42,150 --> 02:08:43,139
Shruti!

1730
02:08:48,490 --> 02:08:50,185
Spoiled my mood in the temple.
- Listen.

1731
02:08:54,929 --> 02:08:56,328
Are you able to recogniz me?

1732
02:08:57,232 --> 02:08:58,995
You look familiar.

1733
02:08:59,901 --> 02:09:00,959
Tell me where have I seen you?

1734
02:09:01,169 --> 02:09:03,433
In Siliguri's restaurant.

1735
02:09:04,305 --> 02:09:05,294
With Shruti.

1736
02:09:06,241 --> 02:09:07,230
Yeah.

1737
02:09:08,476 --> 02:09:09,807
I want to talk to you.

1738
02:09:13,481 --> 02:09:14,470
Just five minutes.

1739
02:09:17,886 --> 02:09:19,820
All her talks still echoes
in my mind.

1740
02:09:21,256 --> 02:09:22,518
'Don't ever leave me, Obi.'

1741
02:09:22,991 --> 02:09:24,549
'I won't be able to live
without you, Obi.'

1742
02:09:28,530 --> 02:09:30,498
But unfortunately she
can remember anything now.

1743
02:09:32,934 --> 02:09:34,231
I am very saddened for her.

1744
02:09:34,536 --> 02:09:36,766
But I am most sad about you.

1745
02:09:38,306 --> 02:09:41,002
When she refused to recognize
me in Siliguri...

1746
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:42,809
...I was very agitated.

1747
02:09:43,878 --> 02:09:45,641
Because we are very good friends.

1748
02:09:47,081 --> 02:09:48,070
But...

1749
02:09:48,683 --> 02:09:50,810
You were to be married, isn't it?

1750
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:52,814
My parents, friends...

1751
02:09:53,655 --> 02:09:56,681
...even the folk from Phoolwaid do
not that Shruit's lost her memory.

1752
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:01,089
If they know, they will be
highly pained.

1753
02:10:01,462 --> 02:10:02,895
We will help you.

1754
02:10:04,632 --> 02:10:06,327
But if Shruti's father
comes to know...

1755
02:10:06,901 --> 02:10:08,129
...he will not spare us.

1756
02:10:08,403 --> 02:10:09,961
Don't worry about that.

1757
02:10:11,272 --> 02:10:13,001
I shall not let anything
happen to you.

1758
02:10:14,909 --> 02:10:16,376
I shall take care of
her father.

1759
02:10:16,845 --> 02:10:18,745
You may take care of
her father...

1760
02:10:19,581 --> 02:10:21,412
...but how would you make
Shruti understand?

1761
02:10:22,150 --> 02:10:24,118
I am confident that I will be
able to make her understand.

1762
02:10:25,753 --> 02:10:28,153
You just make Shruti meet me once.

1763
02:10:30,024 --> 02:10:30,922
All right.

1764
02:10:31,025 --> 02:10:34,722
To say sorry to her for today's
incident I'll call her somewhere.

1765
02:10:37,465 --> 02:10:38,454
Hey, Shruti.

1766
02:10:38,766 --> 02:10:39,755
Hi!

1767
02:10:39,901 --> 02:10:40,890
Hi!

1768
02:10:41,202 --> 02:10:42,191
Sit.

1769
02:10:45,406 --> 02:10:46,202
Thanks.

1770
02:10:46,307 --> 02:10:47,035
Thanks for what?

1771
02:10:47,141 --> 02:10:49,905
Despite my other day's
behaviour, your coming here.

1772
02:10:50,545 --> 02:10:52,103
The anger I had on you...

1773
02:10:52,347 --> 02:10:54,281
...I felt like breaking your nose.

1774
02:10:54,616 --> 02:10:55,947
We met after so such a long time...

1775
02:10:56,084 --> 02:10:57,642
...and she turned her face
and walked.

1776
02:10:57,986 --> 02:11:00,511
What you did to me,
I did the same.

1777
02:11:00,588 --> 02:11:01,919
What did I do to you?

1778
02:11:02,223 --> 02:11:04,157
In Siliguiri you did not want
to even recognize me.

1779
02:11:04,559 --> 02:11:06,993
What are you saying?
When did I go to Siliguri?

1780
02:11:07,128 --> 02:11:08,618
You mean I am lying?

1781
02:11:08,830 --> 02:11:10,058
Ask Amit.

1782
02:11:10,798 --> 02:11:13,767
Okay, I went to Siliguri
and insulted you.

1783
02:11:14,102 --> 02:11:15,091
Settled?

1784
02:11:16,871 --> 02:11:18,168
Your ring is so beautiful!

1785
02:11:18,573 --> 02:11:19,665
Who gave you?

1786
02:11:21,643 --> 02:11:22,632
I don't know.

1787
02:11:22,744 --> 02:11:25,372
I am unable to recall.
- 'Obi, listen, I'm Shruti speaking.'

1788
02:11:26,247 --> 02:11:28,181
'Obi, listen, I'm Shruti speaking.'

1789
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:31,384
'Obi, listen, I'm Shruti speaking.'

1790
02:11:31,619 --> 02:11:34,144
'Obi, listen, I'm Shruti speaking.'
- Hey, the voice is just like mine.

1791
02:11:34,956 --> 02:11:36,856
Not like yours, it's your voice.

1792
02:11:37,258 --> 02:11:40,056
Your voice was recorded
and made it a ringtone.

1793
02:11:40,194 --> 02:11:41,183
What do you mean?

1794
02:11:41,362 --> 02:11:43,330
Who will record my voice?

1795
02:11:43,531 --> 02:11:44,555
The one who loves you.

1796
02:11:44,766 --> 02:11:46,290
The one who gave you
this ring.

1797
02:11:47,435 --> 02:11:48,561
That's me.

1798
02:11:52,573 --> 02:11:54,234
The ring on your finger...

1799
02:11:57,545 --> 02:11:58,534
...Obi.

1800
02:11:58,947 --> 02:11:59,936
Aren't you the same...

1801
02:12:00,214 --> 02:12:02,011
...who came to my house
and had an scrap?

1802
02:12:02,850 --> 02:12:03,908
What do you want?

1803
02:12:04,619 --> 02:12:06,348
I am just to remind you here.

1804
02:12:07,588 --> 02:12:09,419
I don't know you,
reocgnize you.

1805
02:12:10,258 --> 02:12:12,453
And there's no need to
remind any further, okay?

1806
02:12:13,194 --> 02:12:14,183
Shruti.

1807
02:12:15,096 --> 02:12:16,085
Shruti.

1808
02:12:17,398 --> 02:12:18,387
Stop!
- Shruti!

1809
02:12:19,133 --> 02:12:20,122
Don't go.

1810
02:12:20,301 --> 02:12:22,201
Let them settle their
own matter. - Shruti!

1811
02:12:22,637 --> 02:12:23,626
Shruti!

1812
02:12:24,305 --> 02:12:27,035
Shruti, you know me, recognize
me and also loved me.

1813
02:12:27,308 --> 02:12:29,538
Despite knowing nothing about me
you've come so far.

1814
02:12:29,677 --> 02:12:30,871
If my father come to know
about it...

1815
02:12:30,945 --> 02:12:32,640
Your father too knows
that you love me.

1816
02:12:33,982 --> 02:12:35,540
But he hasn't accepted
our relationship.

1817
02:12:36,217 --> 02:12:37,809
He has dragged you
away from me.

1818
02:12:39,287 --> 02:12:40,083
Shruti!

1819
02:12:40,154 --> 02:12:41,280
Shruti...
- What's the matter, man?

1820
02:12:41,489 --> 02:12:42,649
Why are you disturbing her?

1821
02:12:45,093 --> 02:12:46,458
I'm telling you in one sentence.

1822
02:12:47,562 --> 02:12:49,621
She is angry and I am
trying to make her understand.

1823
02:12:49,964 --> 02:12:50,988
Do not disturb.

1824
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:54,397
Or else, I will make a full stop.

1825
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:13,709
Just minute.

1826
02:13:15,590 --> 02:13:17,353
Three certain things.

1827
02:13:18,326 --> 02:13:19,554
I won't take much time.

1828
02:13:20,528 --> 02:13:21,927
You can trust me on it.

1829
02:13:23,998 --> 02:13:25,022
Please, Shruti.

1830
02:13:29,504 --> 02:13:30,971
Shruti! Shruti!

1831
02:13:31,272 --> 02:13:32,261
Hey, Shruti!

1832
02:13:36,677 --> 02:13:38,042
You should be careful.

1833
02:13:44,685 --> 02:13:45,674
Here take this.

1834
02:13:56,130 --> 02:13:57,563
Why are you acting funny?

1835
02:13:58,499 --> 02:13:59,591
Please go away.

1836
02:14:00,101 --> 02:14:01,329
How can I go, tell me?

1837
02:14:02,203 --> 02:14:03,898
I did not love you
to leave you and go.

1838
02:14:04,305 --> 02:14:05,294
Believe me.

1839
02:14:05,473 --> 02:14:07,805
I don't remember having
seen or known you ever.

1840
02:14:08,209 --> 02:14:09,198
I know.

1841
02:14:09,343 --> 02:14:10,935
That's why I am here.

1842
02:14:11,946 --> 02:14:14,210
Try to remember,
you had been to Siliguri.

1843
02:14:15,083 --> 02:14:16,107
To Vinuda's home.

1844
02:14:16,517 --> 02:14:17,950
I had gone to receive
your at the station.

1845
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,319
We also had to been
to Swamji.

1846
02:14:20,955 --> 02:14:22,946
After having seen you he
had that you will be my wife.

1847
02:14:23,424 --> 02:14:25,551
Shruti... - What you are saying
possible that's true...

1848
02:14:25,827 --> 02:14:27,294
...your love can also be true...

1849
02:14:28,162 --> 02:14:29,527
...but I am not that girl.

1850
02:14:30,098 --> 02:14:31,087
I am somebody else.

1851
02:14:32,066 --> 02:14:33,294
You are not somebody else, Shruti.

1852
02:14:33,768 --> 02:14:35,759
You are the same Shruti,
you are my love.

1853
02:14:36,337 --> 02:14:37,326
Shruti!

1854
02:14:37,738 --> 02:14:38,727
Shruti!

1855
02:14:39,574 --> 02:14:40,563
Shruti!

1856
02:14:46,147 --> 02:14:47,136
Oh, It's you.

1857
02:14:49,684 --> 02:14:50,673
Shruti!

1858
02:14:51,752 --> 02:14:52,741
Shruti!

1859
02:14:54,055 --> 02:14:55,044
Shruti...

1860
02:14:56,157 --> 02:14:58,421
Hey, what happened?
What happened?

1861
02:14:58,693 --> 02:15:00,126
Will you guys help me?

1862
02:15:00,194 --> 02:15:01,718
He needs to be taken
to the hospital.

1863
02:15:03,331 --> 02:15:04,992
Will you go fast, please?

1864
02:15:07,034 --> 02:15:09,434
Hello, Doctor uncle, I am Shruti
speaking.

1865
02:15:10,004 --> 02:15:12,302
Agnideb Roy's daughter.
Listen, uncle.

1866
02:15:12,773 --> 02:15:15,003
I am bringing a very critical
patient.

1867
02:15:15,243 --> 02:15:16,403
He's been stabbed.

1868
02:15:16,744 --> 02:15:19,338
Please ask emergency to
keep everything ready.

1869
02:15:21,015 --> 02:15:22,482
Be careful. Slow.

1870
02:15:23,084 --> 02:15:24,073
Easy.

1871
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:27,409
Shruti!

1872
02:15:27,889 --> 02:15:29,982
Don't leave me and go.
Shruti!

1873
02:15:30,057 --> 02:15:31,581
I am not going anywhere
I will be here.

1874
02:15:31,692 --> 02:15:33,751
I have something to
talk to you, Shruti.

1875
02:15:37,031 --> 02:15:38,555
Who that guy?
- I don't know.

1876
02:15:38,799 --> 02:15:40,960
Dr. Uncle, please save him.

1877
02:15:41,202 --> 02:15:43,830
All right, don't worry.
I will take care.

1878
02:15:44,105 --> 02:15:46,471
Also, let my father not know
anything.

1879
02:15:46,908 --> 02:15:47,966
I won't come back again.

1880
02:15:48,042 --> 02:15:49,839
When he is all right ask him
to go home.

1881
02:15:49,911 --> 02:15:51,378
Okay, I will see to it.

1882
02:16:30,985 --> 02:16:32,145
Why are you staring like this?

1883
02:16:32,820 --> 02:16:35,186
Have you found out how Obi is?

1884
02:16:36,924 --> 02:16:40,291
It's not easy to play the
game of love, Shruti.

1885
02:16:41,362 --> 02:16:43,091
Despite being beaten up
so many times...

1886
02:16:43,331 --> 02:16:45,424
...he lying here
just for your sake.

1887
02:16:46,667 --> 02:16:48,635
He does not even know
whether he'll die or survive.

1888
02:16:49,203 --> 02:16:51,899
He only know that
he cannot leave you and go.

1889
02:16:54,609 --> 02:16:58,101
Shruti, he is nothing to me
and I don't even know him.

1890
02:16:58,479 --> 02:17:00,242
But I am able to trust him
but you...

1891
02:17:00,414 --> 02:17:02,473
And you are not able to
have trust in him?

1892
02:17:04,418 --> 02:17:06,978
In Siliguri you were not
able to recognize me.

1893
02:17:07,588 --> 02:17:08,577
And look...

1894
02:17:08,689 --> 02:17:10,657
...now you don't remember
anything about it.

1895
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:13,793
It's not something very old.
Just a few days back.

1896
02:17:14,662 --> 02:17:16,653
At least try to remember it
once, Shruti.

1897
02:17:16,897 --> 02:17:19,695
Where you had been to,
with whom your met.

1898
02:17:19,967 --> 02:17:21,059
Shruti!

1899
02:17:21,602 --> 02:17:22,330
Yes, father.

1900
02:17:22,403 --> 02:17:23,802
Is it over? - Yes.

1901
02:17:23,971 --> 02:17:25,131
Then come.
- Okay.

1902
02:17:31,579 --> 02:17:33,672
Is there any news of Obi?

1903
02:17:33,848 --> 02:17:34,837
No.

1904
02:17:35,283 --> 02:17:36,511
Then call him up.

1905
02:17:38,286 --> 02:17:40,151
'Obi, listen,
I am Shruti speaking.'

1906
02:17:40,788 --> 02:17:42,585
'Obi, listen,
I am Shruti speaking.'

1907
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:45,158
'Obi, listen,
I am Shruti speaking.'

1908
02:17:45,726 --> 02:17:47,694
'Obi, listen,
I am Shruti speaking.'

1909
02:17:48,162 --> 02:17:50,062
'Obi, listen,
I am Shruti speaking.'

1910
02:17:50,631 --> 02:17:51,620
Obi!

1911
02:17:51,866 --> 02:17:53,993
Obi. - Yes father.
- How are you?

1912
02:17:54,201 --> 02:17:55,190
I am better.

1913
02:17:55,336 --> 02:17:56,360
Give it to me. Give me.

1914
02:17:56,470 --> 02:17:58,097
Hold on, your mother will talk.

1915
02:17:59,774 --> 02:18:01,935
Hell, Obi!
- Hi, mother.

1916
02:18:02,143 --> 02:18:04,270
When are you coming back
home with Shruti?

1917
02:18:04,412 --> 02:18:05,538
I am returning today, mother.

1918
02:18:06,514 --> 02:18:10,041
Inform everyone that I am returning
with the Phollwadi's daughter-in-law.

1919
02:20:58,886 --> 02:21:01,946
Because your Shruti's father that's
why I did not say anything.

1920
02:21:02,490 --> 02:21:05,357
But after this if everyone
come between me and her...

1921
02:21:06,460 --> 02:21:08,360
...then telling
you in one sentence.

1922
02:21:09,196 --> 02:21:10,356
Not only father...

1923
02:21:10,664 --> 02:21:13,155
...even if father's father comes,
I will bury him here and now.

1924
02:21:13,834 --> 02:21:17,429
You won't even able to say
what things son-in-law sent to you.

1925
02:21:19,373 --> 02:21:20,305
Come Shruti.

1926
02:21:20,407 --> 02:21:22,136
Why are you after me?

1927
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:23,702
Go away.

1928
02:21:24,912 --> 02:21:26,641
Shruti, please come.
- Please go!

1929
02:21:31,051 --> 02:21:32,040
Sorry, Shruti.

1930
02:22:13,994 --> 02:22:15,655
Shruti! Shruti!

1931
02:22:22,202 --> 02:22:23,191
Shruti!

1932
02:22:24,071 --> 02:22:25,060
Shruti!

1933
02:22:26,273 --> 02:22:27,262
Shruti!

1934
02:22:49,496 --> 02:22:50,485
Look, Shruti, look.

1935
02:22:50,831 --> 02:22:53,425
This is the very place where you
spent most happy days of your life.

1936
02:22:54,301 --> 02:22:55,290
Look at them.

1937
02:22:55,436 --> 02:22:57,233
Just because you have
how happy there are!

1938
02:22:57,605 --> 02:22:59,505
Hey, they can also give
their lives for you.

1939
02:23:00,608 --> 02:23:01,870
Come, Shruti! Come.

1940
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:03,599
Come.

1941
02:23:06,947 --> 02:23:07,777
Welcome back, dear.

1942
02:23:07,848 --> 02:23:10,282
We were waiting for
your arrival.

1943
02:23:10,851 --> 02:23:14,287
Come. It's blessing of Goddess
that you are together.

1944
02:23:14,455 --> 02:23:16,047
And no one can change that.

1945
02:23:16,457 --> 02:23:18,049
Go, take her inside.

1946
02:23:18,425 --> 02:23:19,414
Yes, father.

1947
02:23:20,861 --> 02:23:23,421
This way. - When you left
leaving brother Obi...

1948
02:23:23,631 --> 02:23:25,326
...we were highly pained.

1949
02:23:25,532 --> 02:23:28,023
Did not I ask you to
take care of, Obi?

1950
02:23:28,402 --> 02:23:29,596
Why did you go?

1951
02:23:29,770 --> 02:23:31,635
After this if you leave him
agian even for a day...

1952
02:23:31,772 --> 02:23:33,137
I will never talk to you.

1953
02:23:33,273 --> 02:23:35,741
Agreed that you were held,
but couldn't you run and come?

1954
02:23:35,909 --> 02:23:38,207
It's not merely love but
one must respect it too.

1955
02:23:38,946 --> 02:23:39,970
Uncle, stopped me...

1956
02:23:40,114 --> 02:23:42,241
...or I would've come to Kolkata,
begged you and brought you here.

1957
02:23:42,516 --> 02:23:43,778
Then we would have
seen what your father could do.

1958
02:23:43,917 --> 02:23:46,249
Without you the entire neighbourhood
too looked so barren.

1959
02:23:46,487 --> 02:23:48,614
Now you are here.
we are relieved.

1960
02:23:49,189 --> 02:23:51,783
Now you will see that
we will celebrate for month.

1961
02:23:51,859 --> 02:23:54,157
Shruti, promise you will not
go back again leaving us.

1962
02:23:54,395 --> 02:23:56,659
Sister, now my car will be
able to come out.

1963
02:23:56,830 --> 02:23:59,765
The better end makes
everything better.

1964
02:23:59,967 --> 02:24:00,956
Come.

1965
02:24:03,003 --> 02:24:04,095
Mother. - Welcome, dear.

1966
02:24:04,371 --> 02:24:06,566
Entire night I kept awake
waiting for your arrival.

1967
02:24:07,207 --> 02:24:09,732
My Obi is alive just because
of your love.

1968
02:24:13,847 --> 02:24:15,474
Go, son. Take her inside.

1969
02:24:15,783 --> 02:24:16,772
Go.

1970
02:24:17,017 --> 02:24:18,006
Come.

1971
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:21,109
Come on, come.

1972
02:24:34,268 --> 02:24:35,257
Hold on.

1973
02:24:49,550 --> 02:24:50,539
Speak.

1974
02:24:51,952 --> 02:24:54,147
Local SP has informed
me about you.

1975
02:24:54,922 --> 02:24:56,651
You are a respects
citizen of this area.

1976
02:24:57,558 --> 02:24:59,355
But he has complained
to us that...

1977
02:24:59,593 --> 02:25:01,652
...your son has kidnapped
his daughter.

1978
02:25:02,463 --> 02:25:04,863
So keeping your respect in mind
I am requesting you...

1979
02:25:05,099 --> 02:25:07,897
...that without any protest
return his daughter to him.

1980
02:25:08,068 --> 02:25:11,526
Had I wanted to something, I'd have
dragged him and brought to Kolkota.

1981
02:25:12,005 --> 02:25:13,597
He too sent his man and murdered...

1982
02:25:13,674 --> 02:25:15,335
...one of my man and
ran away with his daughter.

1983
02:25:16,210 --> 02:25:17,973
His daughter love my son.

1984
02:25:18,679 --> 02:25:21,011
On her own accord she has
come here with my son.

1985
02:25:21,181 --> 02:25:21,909
All right.

1986
02:25:22,015 --> 02:25:24,074
Call her we would like to hear
from her own mouth. - All right.

1987
02:25:24,685 --> 02:25:26,550
I will ask before everyone present.

1988
02:25:27,187 --> 02:25:29,155
And if she agrees to go back
on her own...

1989
02:25:29,857 --> 02:25:30,949
...then you can take her.

1990
02:25:31,792 --> 02:25:33,191
But if you try forcing her...

1991
02:25:33,994 --> 02:25:35,393
...the I am warning you...

1992
02:25:35,863 --> 02:25:37,524
...nobody will be able to
return from here.

1993
02:25:38,432 --> 02:25:39,421
Come!

1994
02:25:44,905 --> 02:25:46,668
Come. Look, Shruti,
take a look.

1995
02:25:47,174 --> 02:25:49,802
This is the very room which
you decorated with your own hands.

1996
02:25:50,677 --> 02:25:51,837
You had said if you have
to stay here...

1997
02:25:51,945 --> 02:25:53,071
...so make it worth living
for human beings.

1998
02:25:53,180 --> 02:25:55,148
Look. Everything is the same.

1999
02:25:55,649 --> 02:25:57,378
Look. Are you able to recall?

2000
02:25:58,118 --> 02:25:59,142
Aren't you able to recall?

2001
02:25:59,887 --> 02:26:00,876
Shruti...

2002
02:26:01,288 --> 02:26:02,380
...look at this.

2003
02:26:03,223 --> 02:26:04,690
This sari, the jwelery...

2004
02:26:04,892 --> 02:26:06,519
...everything is brought
by you.

2005
02:26:06,994 --> 02:26:08,723
You said, you are going to be
Phooliwadi's daughter, boss.

2006
02:26:08,829 --> 02:26:10,228
Won't I have to be dressed
up like the one.

2007
02:26:12,032 --> 02:26:16,230
Shruti, can't you remember
anything?

2008
02:26:16,537 --> 02:26:19,529
You bought a suite for my father,
a sari for the mother...

2009
02:26:19,773 --> 02:26:21,240
...and said that they were
your father now on.

2010
02:26:21,408 --> 02:26:23,808
And as I am marrying, everyone
has to be well dressed.

2011
02:26:24,111 --> 02:26:25,237
Can't your remember?

2012
02:26:26,180 --> 02:26:27,169
Shruti.

2013
02:26:28,882 --> 02:26:30,975
Shruti, look at this.

2014
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:33,315
Look, look at this.

2015
02:26:33,487 --> 02:26:35,717
This is the very place where
you asked for a child.

2016
02:26:36,490 --> 02:26:37,855
And you said even if you
forget me...

2017
02:26:37,958 --> 02:26:39,789
...my child will remind you
everything.

2018
02:26:40,594 --> 02:26:43,119
Shruti... can't your remember
anything of it?

2019
02:26:43,664 --> 02:26:45,461
Try to remember please.

2020
02:26:49,503 --> 02:26:51,266
What are you saying?
- Yes, uncle.

2021
02:26:51,405 --> 02:26:52,599
Shruti has forgotten everything.

2022
02:26:52,973 --> 02:26:55,806
She does not even remember
that she was ever here.

2023
02:26:56,009 --> 02:26:57,738
She does not remember
anyone.

2024
02:26:58,011 --> 02:26:59,603
Not even Obi.

2025
02:27:23,003 --> 02:27:24,061
Shruti, come here.

2026
02:27:24,705 --> 02:27:27,401
Don't go Shruti! Don't go.

2027
02:27:27,608 --> 02:27:28,597
Shruti!

2028
02:27:28,675 --> 02:27:30,302
Tell them that you are
not going back, please.

2029
02:27:30,410 --> 02:27:32,776
Will you take her back?
Try doing that!

2030
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:34,313
I will slit your throat.

2031
02:27:34,381 --> 02:27:35,848
What's he use yelling at him.

2032
02:27:36,083 --> 02:27:38,051
Tell the one who has
forgotten.

2033
02:27:38,685 --> 02:27:39,879
You might have forgotten
everything...

2034
02:27:39,987 --> 02:27:43,354
...but could you forget the time
spent here with Obi?

2035
02:27:43,757 --> 02:27:44,951
You can forget everything...

2036
02:27:45,192 --> 02:27:47,558
...but a person who you
loved so much...

2037
02:27:47,694 --> 02:27:49,321
...how can you ever forget that.

2038
02:27:49,429 --> 02:27:51,761
Till death it will be with you.

2039
02:27:52,966 --> 02:27:54,160
Indranth Babau!

2040
02:27:54,835 --> 02:27:56,029
What about your word...

2041
02:27:56,803 --> 02:27:59,567
...the if Shruti wants to go on
her own wish, you will let her.

2042
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:01,502
Ask your son to let off.

2043
02:28:06,947 --> 02:28:08,005
Keep quiet!

2044
02:28:08,448 --> 02:28:09,608
You all keep quiet.

2045
02:28:10,284 --> 02:28:13,947
Shruti will go or stay it
will be decided by her.

2046
02:28:15,022 --> 02:28:16,182
Take your daughter with you.

2047
02:28:16,657 --> 02:28:18,784
If she is willing to go on her
own, then take her.

2048
02:28:22,396 --> 02:28:23,556
Shruti, my child.

2049
02:28:24,665 --> 02:28:26,394
You don't need to be
afraid of anyone.

2050
02:28:27,534 --> 02:28:29,126
I am with you.

2051
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:33,367
Speak up, dear. Did not you
ever love my son?

2052
02:28:36,276 --> 02:28:37,265
No.

2053
02:28:38,445 --> 02:28:40,310
Are you saying under
someone's pressure?

2054
02:28:41,081 --> 02:28:42,673
I am telling you,
I am there for you.

2055
02:28:43,417 --> 02:28:45,146
You never loved him?

2056
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:48,109
Go then.

2057
02:28:48,355 --> 02:28:49,617
Go away from here.

2058
02:28:50,424 --> 02:28:51,982
I've just one request.

2059
02:28:52,926 --> 02:28:56,692
Before going kill my son

2060
02:28:57,898 --> 02:29:00,492
End his life with your own hands.

2061
02:29:00,934 --> 02:29:01,923
Shruti!

2062
02:29:02,970 --> 02:29:03,959
Come here.

2063
02:29:07,674 --> 02:29:09,539
No, no. You don't take her away.

2064
02:29:09,810 --> 02:29:11,573
Please don't take her.
- Shruti!

2065
02:29:11,912 --> 02:29:12,901
Shruti!

2066
02:29:15,782 --> 02:29:17,909
Please don't go, Shruti!
Please.

2067
02:29:18,051 --> 02:29:19,177
Let off my hand.

2068
02:29:19,486 --> 02:29:20,817
Why are you saying this?

2069
02:29:21,521 --> 02:29:23,785
It's not some game that if
you ask to leave and I will.

2070
02:29:24,491 --> 02:29:26,220
I know how deeply you love me.

2071
02:29:27,227 --> 02:29:29,991
Shruti, you love me more than
I love you.

2072
02:29:30,764 --> 02:29:32,732
Were not you the one who told me
even if your father kills you...

2073
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:34,863
...even then I should
not leave you.

2074
02:29:35,335 --> 02:29:38,498
Even if you forget,
I should remind you.

2075
02:29:39,339 --> 02:29:41,204
And today you are asking
me to leave you.

2076
02:29:42,075 --> 02:29:43,372
I won't be able to do that.

2077
02:29:43,543 --> 02:29:45,170
I will die but not live
without you.

2078
02:29:45,312 --> 02:29:46,574
Hey, let her go.

2079
02:29:47,247 --> 02:29:48,236
Come. - Shruti!

2080
02:29:48,615 --> 02:29:50,242
Shruti! Shruti!

2081
02:29:51,018 --> 02:29:52,007
Shruti!

2082
02:29:55,722 --> 02:29:57,121
Come on move. Move.

2083
02:29:57,290 --> 02:29:58,780
Shruti! Shruti!

2084
02:30:00,293 --> 02:30:02,227
Please don't go. Don't go.

2085
02:30:02,529 --> 02:30:03,928
Please leave my hand.

2086
02:30:05,565 --> 02:30:07,760
Don't you believe all
these people?

2087
02:30:10,504 --> 02:30:13,496
The world exists of faith, Shruti!

2088
02:30:14,074 --> 02:30:15,837
When nurse said at the time of
your birth to your mother...

2089
02:30:15,942 --> 02:30:17,933
...that you are her daughter,
your mother believed her.

2090
02:30:18,311 --> 02:30:21,041
Your mother pointed to your father then
you believe that he is your father.

2091
02:30:21,281 --> 02:30:24,444
Your father said, this is earth,
this sky and God, your believe him.

2092
02:30:24,885 --> 02:30:27,080
And today all these people
are saying I am telling you...

2093
02:30:27,187 --> 02:30:28,586
...but your not believing it.

2094
02:30:28,922 --> 02:30:30,822
Go, go, go. Get going.

2095
02:30:31,425 --> 02:30:33,416
Before trusting anyone
one has to love him.

2096
02:30:33,727 --> 02:30:35,888
It means, you have never loved me
as you don't trust me.

2097
02:30:35,996 --> 02:30:37,861
Go, go, go.
Hey, no one will stop her.

2098
02:30:38,031 --> 02:30:39,396
Go away from here.
Let her go.

2099
02:30:41,001 --> 02:30:42,434
Let her.
Clear out.

2100
02:30:42,736 --> 02:30:44,363
If anybody tries to stop her
I will kill him.

2101
02:30:44,604 --> 02:30:45,229
Go.

2102
02:30:45,338 --> 02:30:47,101
Go, go, you people go.

2103
02:30:47,274 --> 02:30:49,367
Hey, let her go.

2104
02:30:50,110 --> 02:30:50,974
Hey, no.

2105
02:30:51,078 --> 02:30:52,568
Hey, Shruti! Shruti!

2106
02:30:53,413 --> 02:30:55,347
As if today I will everyday
pray to God...

2107
02:30:55,515 --> 02:30:57,346
...the don't ever remember me.

2108
02:30:58,452 --> 02:30:59,919
You won't be able to bear it.

2109
02:31:00,387 --> 02:31:01,376
Go.

2110
02:31:04,925 --> 02:31:05,755
If you are going, go.

2111
02:31:05,826 --> 02:31:08,556
But before you cross Phoolwadi,
you will find I am dead.

2112
02:31:09,296 --> 02:31:11,093
And you too won't be able
to live after that.

2113
02:31:11,198 --> 02:31:13,063
Shruti, you too won't be able
to be alive.

2114
02:32:10,257 --> 02:32:11,246
Shruti!

2115
02:32:24,571 --> 02:32:25,560
Shruti!

2116
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:36,240
I love you Obi.
I love you.

2117
02:32:36,716 --> 02:32:38,877
I love you! - You've
remembered everything, Shruti?

2118
02:32:39,085 --> 02:32:40,074
No.

2119
02:32:40,754 --> 02:32:42,551
I don't remember anything.

2120
02:32:43,323 --> 02:32:45,553
I don't even remember I ever
came here.

2121
02:32:46,226 --> 02:32:48,023
Whether I met you or not...

2122
02:32:48,461 --> 02:32:50,258
...whether I loved you or not...

2123
02:32:50,764 --> 02:32:52,322
...I can't remember anything.

2124
02:32:54,034 --> 02:32:56,332
But the agonies you are going
through for my sake...

2125
02:32:56,970 --> 02:32:58,403
...and are ready even to die...

2126
02:32:59,506 --> 02:33:02,270
...and I kept rejecting you
all the time...

2127
02:33:02,909 --> 02:33:04,809
...despite that you kept
loving me.

2128
02:33:06,046 --> 02:33:08,241
One who loves a girl so much...

2129
02:33:09,115 --> 02:33:11,083
...they never lie.

2130
02:33:11,918 --> 02:33:16,981
So as of this moment,
I will only love you, Obi.

2131
02:33:17,958 --> 02:33:18,890
I love you.

2132
02:33:18,992 --> 02:33:20,687
Shruti.
- I really love you.

2133
02:33:21,127 --> 02:33:26,963
Crazy...
my heart is out of my hands.

2134
02:33:27,300 --> 02:33:32,704
This crazy... he loves you.

2135
02:33:33,273 --> 02:33:38,905
Crazy...
my heart is out of my hands.

2136
02:33:39,279 --> 02:33:45,275
This crazy... he loves you.

2137
02:33:57,364 --> 02:34:02,961
The intoxication of your blue eyes.

2138
02:34:04,404 --> 02:34:07,669
Come on, come close to me.

2139
02:34:07,807 --> 02:34:11,265
I am unable to bear,
my heart is in doldrums.

2140
02:34:11,511 --> 02:34:14,878
You are the only one for me.

2141
02:34:15,115 --> 02:34:22,044
O my love, O my love.

2142
02:34:22,188 --> 02:34:29,094
O my love, O my love.

2143
02:34:36,369 --> 02:34:42,933
I have broght dreams
but standing alone.

2144
02:34:43,543 --> 02:34:50,278
Enter through the way of
my heart, come into it.

2145
02:34:50,483 --> 02:34:54,010
I am unable to bear,
my heart is in doldrums.

2146
02:34:54,220 --> 02:34:57,519
You are the only one for me.

2147
02:34:57,824 --> 02:35:04,696
O my love, O my love.

2148
02:35:04,931 --> 02:35:12,030
O my love, O my love.

2149
02:35:19,112 --> 02:35:25,779
Why I'm unable to explain to you
why I am unable to tell you.

2150
02:35:26,152 --> 02:35:33,024
Only the heart knows what
it wants to say to you.

2151
02:35:33,193 --> 02:35:36,629
I am unable to bear,
my heart is in doldrums.

2152
02:35:36,863 --> 02:35:40,026
You are on the only one for me.

2153
02:35:40,433 --> 02:35:47,271
O my love, O my love.

2154
02:35:47,574 --> 02:35:52,671
O my love, O my love.
