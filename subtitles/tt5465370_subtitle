1
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,044
"See the madness."

2
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,091
"You are alone, I am alone."

3
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:27,325
"We are having fun, swear, swear.."

4
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,996
You're listening to
'Raat Baaki Baat Baaki'...

5
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,802
...and it's 4 o'clock.

6
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,035
But we're still continuing to play...

7
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,668
...your requests.

8
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,714
This is Karan Singh, and

9
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,249
...on Tejal's request,
here's this super-hit song..

10
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,048
...from the film 'Tezaab'

11
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,283
Even you can send in your requests...

12
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,951
...but to do that, you must call.

13
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,322
So...do call.

14
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:02,558
"The world is asleep.
The sky is calm."

15
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:08,867
"The world is asleep.
The sky is calm."

16
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:17,370
"Beckoning
destinations have gone quiet."

17
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,551
"The path is all deserted."

18
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:27,024
"The world is asleep.
The sky is calm."

19
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:35,123
"Beckoning
destinations have gone quiet."

20
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,469
Sir, we haven't done anything.

21
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,204
Sir...where are you taking us?

22
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,212
Get down.
- Come on.

23
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,647
Keep walking down.
- Come on.

24
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,945
Sir...we haven't done anything.

25
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:27,484
Sir...

26
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,487
Trying to be a hero?
- Sir.

27
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,351
Come on.

28
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,681
'There's an old Sufi saying..'

29
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:05,381
'Life always tests you with your
special virtue that exists in you'

30
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:10,261
'Hundreds of similar proverbs
are shared on social media every day.'

31
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:14,793
'But only one person in a million would
actually choose to live by these ideals'

32
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,900
'I've met one such
unique girl in my life.'

33
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,362
'Akira.'

34
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,234
'In Sanskrit, Akira means..'

35
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,208
'..strength with grace.'

36
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,774
'Graceful strength.'

37
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,674
'And life tested this
very quality of hers.'

38
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:37,312
"New paths are ahead.
New turns are ahead."

39
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,483
"Don't be nervous."

40
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:46,827
"Keep on going alone
on your own strength."

41
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,527
"Determination is your companion."

42
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:58,566
"What do you care if darkness
is filled in the whole world."

43
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:05,480
"Why should your evenings
coax lamps for light."

44
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:10,677
"Your both eyes are filled with light."

45
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:15,419
"You are my star."

46
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:19,486
"You are my star."

47
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:27,161
"You are my star filled with light."

48
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,772
"You are my star."

49
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,441
Didn't I tell you?

50
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,306
This is where...

51
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,779
...these louts loiter about.

52
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,077
Come on.

53
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,874
Didn't she come today?

54
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,544
Exactly what I was saying?

55
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,349
Start the bike.
- It's okay.

56
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,117
How dare you reject me!

57
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,922
Take that, die!

58
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,253
Let's go. . . let's go.

59
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,118
Drive faster!
- Sister.

60
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,763
Faster, faster!

61
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,530
Didn't anyone see him?

62
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,130
I saw him.

63
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,529
No.

64
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,765
No.

65
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:06,734
It was him!

66
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,073
You...

67
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,244
Get inside!

68
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,217
How dare you tell the police?

69
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,485
Take that.

70
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,093
Get lost!

71
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:42,144
"The whole nature is reliant on you."

72
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:50,912
"You plant moon and stars."

73
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:57,455
"The sun burns through your heat."

74
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,090
"You are unaware of your miracles."

75
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:06,570
"You are the ground that
holds lakhs of skies.

76
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:14,169
"You are my star filled with light."

77
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:18,142
"You are my star."

78
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,377
Careful.

79
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,530
This can't be!

80
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,899
This can't be!

81
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,647
Why are you crying?
- Don't cry.

82
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,484
It's okay!
- We're here with you.

83
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,716
Smile. It's okay.

84
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,223
Don't be disheartened.

85
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,418
We'll always be with you.

86
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,894
Your face's scarred, but that doesn't
mean your life's scarred too.

87
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,486
Smile, that's it.

88
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,498
That's more like it.

89
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,773
"Your face is like a flower."

90
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,371
Oh <i>my...</i>

91
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,775
Greetings, my lady...!

92
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,238
This has become a daily routine.

93
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,980
Why doesn't someone
take action against them?

94
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,676
What a gorgeous girl...

95
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,282
Look here.

96
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,154
Your sister-in-law.
- She must be your sister-in-law.

97
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,089
Sweetheart, look this way.

98
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,352
Make me your sweetheart.

99
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,589
Amazing.

100
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,199
Madam.

101
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,666
You see, madam.

102
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,499
Hello...hello.

103
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,632
HE'!-

104
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,972
You..

105
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,404
Wait.

106
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,804
Someone help her.
- Anyone.

107
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,474
Someone help her.

108
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,607
Mister.

109
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,725
'Everyone saw what happened.'

110
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,868
'But the boy's father had
a huge vote-bank supporting him.'

111
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,628
'Your Honor,
this girl assaulted my client first.'

112
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,798
'It was an unprovoked attack.'

113
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,170
'But Your Honor, I have witnesses.'

114
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,743
'I can prove that Akira is innocent.'

115
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,403
'But the witness is also saying..'

116
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:05,005
'..that this crazy girl
brutally assaulted three boys.'

117
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,607
'In light of all the evidence..'

118
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,881
'..the court decides to send Akira
to the Child Correction facility..'

119
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,923
'..until we reach a verdict.'

120
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,721
'And this way...it took three
years to prove Akira's innocence.'

121
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,726
Akira.
- Yes.

122
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,996
Listen.
- I am listening. Go ahead.

123
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,796
Your brother's arriving
from Mumbai today.

124
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,963
He called yesterday.

125
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,034
Why?

126
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,362
He's calling me to Mumbai.

127
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,534
I mean you and me.
To stay with him.

128
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,136
Mumbai?
- Yeah.

129
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,339
I am not going anywhere.

130
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,606
Look, Akira, stop arguing.

131
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,282
He's coming after a very long time.

132
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,745
Come home soon from college.

133
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,677
When he went against your wishes..

134
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,987
...and married that Mumbai-girl,
you swore never to see his face again.

135
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,822
He's worried about his child,
that's why he's calling us.

136
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,826
He's calling you to
wash his kid's soiled pants.

137
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,231
He never called all these years.

138
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,030
And now when they can't handle
the child, he calls everyday.

139
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,100
I am not leaving Jodhpur
and going anywhere.

140
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,906
Akira.

141
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,640
We're here.
- Yes.

142
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,508
<i>Thank you, AM.
- Yeah.</i>

143
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,542
I'll see you in the evening.
- Definitely.

144
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,947
Thank you.

145
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,355
Grandma, how are you?

146
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,284
I am fine.

147
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,382
Ajay, you returned home after so long.

148
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,118
What to do, grandma?
I was busy with work.

149
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,555
See you later.
- Okay.

150
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,456
Mom.

151
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,166
Excuse me, madam.
- Yes.

152
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,565
The principal wants to meet Akira.

153
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,970
I'll try talking to her.

154
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,876
Come in.

155
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,915
Sit down.
- No, I am fine.

156
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,185
We were just talking about you.

157
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,376
It's a good thing thatâ€œ

158
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,889
...your brother wants
to take both of you to Mumbai.

159
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,720
To look after you two.

160
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,388
Why are you saying no?

161
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,591
Well...the new
semester's just started.

162
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,765
And I've already wasted so many years.

163
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,102
Uncle...I can easily get
her admission in Mumbai.

164
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,903
I know the principal at Holy
Cross Arts and Science College..

165
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,341
...really well.

166
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,077
I'm like a father to you.

167
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,107
There's no scope for further
education in this small city.

168
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,112
If you go to Mumbai..

169
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,685
...it'll really help
your higher studies.

170
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,680
The door's open.

171
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,642
Come in.

172
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,847
<i>Heyâ€œ</i>

173
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,921
Mom...Akira,
this is Shilpa.

174
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,323
Come in.

175
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,758
Bless you...it's alright.

176
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,400
Oh, sorry..
- It's okay. Bless you.

177
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,593
Come, I'll show you. Give it.

178
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:17,906
Come.

179
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,880
Sorry, wrong house.

180
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,132
You...wrong house.

181
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,740
Sid.
- Hi, sis.

182
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:50,637
Come.

183
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,464
That's my brother.

184
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,106
May I come in?
- Yeah.

185
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,541
He lives here with us.
- I see.

186
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,238
Sid.

187
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,715
Hello, aunt.
- Hello, son.

188
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,712
He's planning to go abroad..

189
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,411
...to do his Doctorate in Finance.

190
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:04,783
Doctor!

191
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,686
Yes.

192
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,490
It's really hard work, isn't it?

193
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,326
Doctors are highly respected.

194
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,962
This is great.
Now we've a doctor at home.

195
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,124
Son, I've got severe pain
in my knee for three months.

196
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,494
Take a look. - Sorry, aunt...I'm
not the kind of doctor you think.

197
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,428
I am doing Finance..

198
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,631
I mean...I am doing a doctorate
in money-management.

199
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,505
PhD! It's like a degree.

200
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,571
Well, that's good.

201
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,506
Doctors don't get much respect.

202
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,442
You can find a bunch of
them at every nook and corner.

203
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,483
Yes, aunt...that's why..

204
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,920
Actually, he also works
in a Social Welfare Organizationâ€œ

205
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,685
...along with a few of his friends.

206
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,657
'Raindrops.'
- I see.

207
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,785
He does social work.

208
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,566
Forget that,
let's play squash today.

209
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,828
I don't mind,
but you will lose again.

210
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:51,594
I'll let you win.

211
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,170
Listen..
- Stop talking. Sid, eat.

212
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,839
Akira, the principal's
called us at 11 am.

213
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,809
And it'll take around
two hours to get there.

214
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,080
We'll get you a local-train pass.

215
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,053
So that you can easily
commute to and fro.

216
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,820
I'll stay at the hostel.

217
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,716
Why will you stay in the hostel?

218
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,156
Yeah, Akira? Why the hostel?

219
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,594
The hostel rent,
canteen expenses...

220
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,662
It's unnecessaryâ€œ

221
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,434
<i>pqayâ€œ.</i>

222
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,706
Why are you forcing her?

223
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,538
If she wants to stay in the hostel,
then let her.

224
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,805
We shouldn't have a problem.

225
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,204
She will visit us
often...during her holidays.

226
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,061
Akira, Ajay's told me everything.

227
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,122
Don't worry,
you won't be wasting this year.

228
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,035
You...just concentrate
on your studies.

229
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,527
Thank you.

230
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,135
About the hostel?

231
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:10,045
Father, I talked to you over
the phone about that hostel room.

232
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,409
Yeah..

233
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,081
Yes, Father.

234
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:17,652
Sister d'Mello, is there
any room available in the hostel?

235
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,615
No, Father.

236
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,619
We had four students from
Nasik as well, asking for rooms.

237
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,091
But we couldn't help them either.

238
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,327
What can we do?

239
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,796
But we do have Room No.
17, which we never consider.

240
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:34,735
Yes...but..
- What's the problem in Room No. 17?

241
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,975
Last year, one of the students
committed suicide in that room.

242
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:43,413
Since then...no one
is willing to stay there.

243
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,978
It's been closed since then.
- Father, I don't have a problem.

244
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,142
I can live there.

245
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,316
Akira, someone committed suicide..
- It's okay.

246
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,284
Excuse me.

247
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,981
Dad, weren't you looking for this?
- Where was it?

248
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,081
You forgot it in the kitchen
while talking to mom.

249
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,354
I'll get some
privacy...I'll live there.

250
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,959
But, Akira,
someone committed suicide..

251
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,897
Don't discourage her
if she wants to live there.

252
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,597
No, Father, I was just..
- Leave that.

253
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,140
Ajay, remember we discussed about a
donation for the old church.

254
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,200
Yes.
- Here it is.

255
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,669
Yes.

256
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,542
The college campus is 55 acres wide.

257
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,507
Father's home is
in the campus as well.

258
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,984
There's an old church as well,
which has been closed for a long time.

259
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,757
Father's been collecting
donations for its renovation.

260
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,240
There's a school here too?
- Yes.

261
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,305
But only for deaf and dumb children.

262
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,003
But it's under the same management.

263
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,640
Come.

264
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,323
Ma'am...my Ipod's missing.

265
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,448
Missing?
- Yes.

266
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,083
Since when?

267
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,128
It was on my bed,
I just went to the next room.

268
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,696
When I returned, it was missing.

269
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,699
Always lock your room.
I've told you so many times.

270
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,462
I am fed up of these
thefts every week.

271
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,735
Here's the 'Missing' register.

272
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,932
Fill in the details.

273
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,570
We'll inform you if we find anything.

274
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:21,542
Here.

275
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:27,283
See...keep your belongings carefully,
and always lock them away.

276
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,818
Yes.

277
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,155
This is the one.

278
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,051
I'll get the room
cleaned up by evening.

279
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,295
Good stuff.. Must be from down South.

280
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,920
Sir..
- Yes.

281
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,456
Sir, should I drive?
- Why?

282
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,394
You're a bit..

283
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,800
Bapurao.
- Sir.

284
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:51,959
Give me the alcohol tester.

285
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,092
Yes.

286
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,264
Sir.

287
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,074
Check yourself,
it's within the limit.

288
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,917
But, sir, this is something else.

289
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,922
If you lose control.

290
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,190
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.

291
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,789
He's a new recruit,
and wants to test my control.

292
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,697
No, sir.

293
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,401
Let's show him my control.

294
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,938
Let it be, sir.

295
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,178
Sir..

296
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,850
Sir, careful.

297
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,321
Rane, sir.. Rane sir, careful.

298
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,521
It's okay, sir.

299
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,463
What's this?

300
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,228
Oh, God!

301
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,703
Don't say anything, sir.

302
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,776
I am new, but why did you get scared?

303
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,115
This is the first time he hit
the brakes on time.

304
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,477
Get in.

305
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,759
All his creations...
are in the form of couplets.

306
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:30,630
And his main subjects are religion,
ethics and preaching.

307
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,330
Niki.
- Sir, it's a strike.

308
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,363
Sit down everyone!

309
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,108
Strike? What for?

310
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,540
Sir, the canteen food is horrible.

311
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,409
Even the rats are falling sick, sir.

312
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,612
So everyone suggested
that if we complain together.

313
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,843
...then maybe the
contractor will change.

314
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,850
Do you have to do
all this during class?

315
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,849
Can't you do it during lunch-break?

316
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,484
Do you want to join them?
- Yes, sir, we'll go too.

317
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,584
Let's go.

318
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,097
Strike for this, strike for that...
everyone wants to be the next CM.

319
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,112
So, I was saying..

320
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,745
From literature's point of view..
- Are you special?

321
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,212
Don't disturb those
who don't want to join you.

322
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,549
You can all go.

323
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,051
She's crazy.
- Niki, we'll deal with her later.

324
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,456
So where were we?

325
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:42,871
What's going on there?

326
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,766
Sorry.

327
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,375
Madam, she still doesn't
like the canteen food.

328
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,020
Manik.
- Sir.

329
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,563
Should I drive?
- No, sir. I'll drive.

330
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,264
Where's my lighter?

331
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,596
Is it under your seat?

332
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:18,871
Watch out!

333
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,307
<i>Heyâ€œ</i>

334
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,210
What are you doing?

335
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,880
Such disregard for traffic rules.

336
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,776
<i>Heyâ€œ</i>

337
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,246
First you rammed a police-car.

338
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,613
And now you're creating a scene.

339
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:31,779
What do you mean by police-car?

340
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,881
Aren't there any
traffic rules for you?

341
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,356
And you weren't even
wearing a seatbelt.

342
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,051
<i>Heyâ€œ-</i>

343
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:39,823
Uncle, you would've
been squashed like a bug.

344
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,022
Say thank you and leave.
Enough of this nonsense.

345
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,892
Hello, sir. I'm not talking nonsense.

346
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,695
He's showing me the finger.

347
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,095
Do you want me to
explain politely?

348
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,403
Sir...he's a college professor,
show some manners.

349
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,409
Oh, Professor.

350
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,681
What are you doing?

351
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,644
Sir, are you okay?

352
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,979
Sir, careful.

353
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,952
Come back, sir.

354
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,279
And they call themselves
police officers.

355
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,688
They have their own rules.
- Are you hurt?

356
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,862
Sir...I am telling you,
it must be a mistake.

357
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,533
I am sure he didn't know
that he was a professor.

358
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,568
Take my complaint right
now and lodge an FIR.

359
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,964
Sir, it's a small matter.

360
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,474
Don't blow it out of proportion.

361
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,042
I am telling you,
there's nothing I can do about it.

362
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,171
Come, sir. We'll show them.

363
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,573
Let's go.

364
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,677
Everyone sign this,
we'll take this to the commissioner.

365
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,051
The police assaulted our
professor without a reason.

366
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,111
Everyone sign this.

367
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,714
The police think they can do anything.

368
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,292
And they refused to file a complaint.

369
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,089
We'll show them the power of students.

370
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,891
Come on. Let's go.

371
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,159
Let's go.

372
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,360
The police must apologize!

373
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,706
The police must apologize!

374
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:57,899
Control Room! Control Room!

375
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,840
A huge crowd has gathered here.

376
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,076
Please send forces immediately.

377
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,978
The police must apologize!

378
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,916
The police must apologize!

379
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,614
The police must apologize!

380
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:18,423
We want...
- Justice.

381
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,190
Step back.

382
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,232
Step back.
You cannot block the roads.

383
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,960
Please disperse.
- We won't tolerate it.

384
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,467
Get up...don't sit here!
- We won't tolerate it.

385
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,970
Clear the roads.

386
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,765
Get out of here.

387
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:36,005
The police must apologize!

388
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,204
Sir...
- Manik, are you a kid?

389
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,607
Don't talk to them, just kick them
out before the Commissioner arrives.

390
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:42,549
Okay, sir.

391
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:43,984
Yes, charge at them.
- Sir.

392
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:47,981
Charge...phone..

393
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:50,686
Don't know.

394
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,353
Get them out of here.

395
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,292
Come on.

396
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,429
Come on.

397
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,330
Get up...get out of here.

398
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,697
Leave us.

399
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:02,204
The police must apologize!

400
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,683
Get rid of them.

401
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,980
Get them out. Come on.

402
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,863
Sir, one of your officers
assaulted our professor.

403
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,774
Sir, they were hurling stones at us...
uprooting rods.

404
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,476
Shinde was bleeding.
- And you panicked.

405
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,281
No, sir, that's not it.

406
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,651
You wouldn't have fired,
if you hadn't panicked.

407
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:04,016
All you had to do was break a few bones.
It was a small matter.

408
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,083
Sir..

409
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,193
Where's the bottle of water?

410
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,534
Sir, Bapurao took it to the bathroom

411
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,463
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,771
I had mixed vodka in
that bottle which he took.

413
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,569
His backside will start dancing.
Call him.

414
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,972
Yes..
- See if he's done or not.

415
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,505
Bapurao!
- Coming.

416
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:24,744
Let's go.

417
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,607
Bloody thing...it burns.

418
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,154
Manik, you know what to
say in the inquiry. - Yes, sir.

419
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,852
<i>Heyâ€œ</i>

420
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,418
Bloody hell, he'll definitely die.

421
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,289
Oh no...

422
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,692
He rammed the car, sir.

423
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,740
Hello..

424
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,076
Looks like he'd decided to die today.

425
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:01,673
He didn't wear seatbelts either.

426
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,775
The tire burst, sir.

427
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,548
The airbags didn't open either.

428
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,553
The speed at which he came in,
I am sure he's dead.

429
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,717
Sir...let's put him in our
jeep and take him to the hospital.

430
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,619
Waste of time, Rajeshwar!
No point.

431
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,622
What happened? Is he dead?

432
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,424
Seems like it.

433
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,962
No movement in the body.

434
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,094
Doesn't this area fall
under Inspector Khamkar?

435
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,569
That baldy..
- Yeah..

436
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,800
<i>PanvehPanchayat area.</i>

437
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,222
Sir. Look what's here.

438
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,054
Is it full of money?

439
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:50,765
Check it.

440
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:53,995
Yes.

441
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,272
Looks like about 70-80 cr.
- Easily.

442
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,598
What do you think we should do?

443
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,137
Your call, sir.

444
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:19,190
All clear, sir!
- Such a lonely place and so much money!

445
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,254
Did you find Khamkar's number?

446
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,630
I say let's handle this by ourselves.

447
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,234
What say?

448
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,173
It's a gift - we can
all settle down comfortably.

449
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,966
But, sir..

450
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,946
The Goddess of Wealth
is knocking at your door..

451
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,845
...but you'd rather stand in the queue!

452
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,948
Don't worry,
I'll arrange everything.

453
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,315
Manik, come.
- Sir.

454
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,315
Bapurao.

455
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,254
Yeah..

456
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,486
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.

457
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,661
Keep it down.

458
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,068
Bapurao.

459
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,538
Hey, stop!

460
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,413
Leave the bag!

461
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,729
Everything's already messed up.

462
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,302
What...

463
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,092
'News about the increasing number of
thefts in the city over the month.'

464
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,695
'And the recent news of robbery at
Ghanshyam Das Jewellers in Kandivali.'

465
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,401
What's wrong? Not in the mood?

466
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,838
Going home?

467
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,403
I am talking to you.

468
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,839
ACP sir,
why are you wearing your clothes?

469
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,350
Take them off and come here.

470
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,353
I've something more important to do.

471
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,658
Will you please finish your drink
in the hall?

472
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,691
I've to make a call.

473
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,895
It's an official call.

474
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,165
There is tension
at many places in Maharashtra.

475
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,469
After the attack on North Indian
auto drivers in Pune..

476
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,012
...many people have left the city.

477
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:55,574
'We received news of five
road-accidents in and around Mumbai.

478
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,814
The total number
of casualties is four.

479
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,225
Hello.
- Sir.

480
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,467
Manik, did you watch the news?
- Yes, sir, I did.

481
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,031
Our matter simply disappeared into
thin air along with the other news.

482
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,941
The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy.

483
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,612
Listen, we made one mistake.

484
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,647
When I hit him with the jack, I
should've hit him on the face instead.

485
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,717
It would've looked like an accident.

486
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:29,979
But I hit him on the back instead.

487
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:34,489
Now...keep a close watch on
the post-mortem and don't slip up.

488
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,893
Listen, carefully explain
to Bapurao and Rajeshwar...

489
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,094
...what to do with
the rest of the money.

490
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:42,789
Yes, sir.

491
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,424
And from now on, call
me on my new number.

492
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,432
Write it down.

493
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,225
Yes, sir.

494
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,530
988...

495
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,907
"...and don't slip up."

496
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,478
"Listen, carefully explain
to Bapu Rao and Rajeshwar.."

497
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,819
"..what to do with
the rest of the money."

498
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,082
"And from now on call
me on my new number."

499
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,248
"Write it down."

500
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,949
"988...4205869."

501
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:18,594
"Happy Birthday to you.."

502
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,829
Such a big prize
- and you got it so easily.

503
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,403
Where did you record this?

504
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:24,806
In my bedroom.

505
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,173
Around 11 months ago,
I got caught in a hotel raid.

506
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,104
He took my number and address.

507
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,972
...but he didn't register any case.

508
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,745
He released me without
taking any money.

509
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,509
But after thatâ€œ

510
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,656
...he started coming
home whenever he wanted.

511
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,418
At first I didn't
take it too seriously.

512
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,587
I thought he's a police
officer after all..

513
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,823
...someday he'll come in handy.

514
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,256
But then he started bugging
me - romance and whatnot.

515
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,129
I wanted to get rid of him.

516
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,133
And just last week, I fixed
this camera in my bedroom.

517
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,767
...so that he'd stop harassing me.

518
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,045
Call it fate,
look what I got my hands on.

519
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,547
And immediately called you guys.

520
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:13,021
If we make a plan,
we can extort all the money from him.

521
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,184
Maya, if this didn't
involve the police..

522
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,154
...we could've handled
anyone else easily.

523
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,024
And this guy's the ACP.

524
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,453
If he finds out,
he'll charge us with a fake case..

525
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,032
...and kill all of us.

526
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,560
If we make a foolproof plan..

527
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,537
...then we could all go back
to Gorakhpur and live happily.

528
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,834
I don't want to get
into this police mess.

529
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,674
Maya, when you called I thought.

530
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,939
...maybe some college
student or software engineer..

531
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,503
...has fallen head-over-heels for you.

532
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,043
Look, this is quite risky.

533
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,547
You won't be able
to get out of this one.

534
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,309
Let's go.
- Come on.

535
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,022
<i>Sunâ€œ.</i>

536
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,821
Listen...
take a day's time.

537
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,233
Think...
and let me know tomorrow.

538
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,963
Didn't I already tell you?

539
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,567
Look, do whatever you want.

540
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,575
But don't ever bring
this matter up again.

541
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,882
Let's go.
- It's getting late.

542
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,919
Your bill, ma'am.

543
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,055
Thanks.

544
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,641
Where is it?

545
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,451
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.

546
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,353
Those students who were
here - do they come regularly?

547
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,550
I don't know, ma'am.
What happened?

548
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,254
There was a camera in my bag,
but now it's missing.

549
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,721
They just passed by my table.

550
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:02,958
I didn't notice, ma'am.

551
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,465
Do you know them?

552
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:08,069
I think they were Holy
Cross college students.

553
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,405
Holy Cross college students!

554
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,980
And now finally,
a small speech by Akira.

555
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:32,719
Good evening.

556
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:38,364
Actually, Father and the lecturers
asked me to give a speech suddenly..

557
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,363
...so I haven't prepared much.

558
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,235
But since its World Disabled Day..

559
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,800
...it reminded me of
something my father said.

560
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,109
My father

561
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,208
We can't hear you!

562
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,543
We can't hear you!

563
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,147
I think the Mike is not working.
- We can't hear you!

564
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,146
We can't hear you!

565
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,118
What's wrong?
We can't hear you!

566
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,825
We can't hear you!

567
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,095
Sir, there's a problem
with the connection.

568
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,826
It'll take a while, sir.

569
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,092
I'll see what's wrong?

570
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,768
We can't hear you!

571
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,299
We can't hear you!

572
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,532
"A disabled person isn't someone
who doesn't have a limb.."

573
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:51,331
"..it's someone who
doesn't use the limbs."

574
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:59,045
"Hands that don't come forth
to help others are 'disabled'."

575
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,385
"The eyes that ignore atrocities...
are 'disabled'."

576
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:15,355
"Feet that turn away and desert
their parents are 'disabled'."

577
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,374
Niki, we must do something about her.

578
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,285
Stop here.

579
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,792
How much?
- Let it be.

580
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:47,725
It's okay.

581
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:48,763
I can't take money from you.

582
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,958
I see...
then come every day at 8 am.

583
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,661
Madam..

584
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,129
It's not a government vehicle.

585
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,268
Here you go.

586
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,804
Good morning, sir.
- Rabiya madam...

587
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,207
Back again?

588
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,610
Are you looking
to score a century in transfers?

589
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,043
The straight path
is often the twisted one, sir.

590
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,780
Did you come with family, or..
- No, sir, I've come alone.

591
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,647
Alone?

592
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,019
Okay?
- Okay, sir.

593
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,400
Hello.

594
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,534
"Manik, did you watch the news?"

595
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,598
"Our matter disappeared into
thin air along with other news."

596
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,704
"The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy."

597
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,241
"Listen, we made one mistake."

598
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,942
"When I hit him with the jack,..

599
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,175
...I should've hit him
on the face instead."

600
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,047
"It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back."

601
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,946
"Now...keep a close watch on
the post-mortem and don't slip up."

602
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:51,016
"Listen, what to do with
the rest of the money..."

603
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,313
'The number you've
called is currently switched off.'

604
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,159
We should've been more careful, sir.

605
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,365
I never thought she would
do such a thing with me.

606
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,193
Her house is locked and she's missing.

607
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,828
Even her phone's switched off.

608
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,368
She's a hooker;
won't be easy to trap her.

609
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,114
Will she be asking
for a share in the money..

610
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,151
...or ask for all of it?

611
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,921
Wonder who else is in this with her?

612
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:58,689
Don't let the word spread.
- Yes.

613
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,359
Sir, the call made to
you was from a prepaid number.

614
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,169
The SIM Card...has been issued
to this college ID.

615
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,767
First year student,
Holy Cross College.

616
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:21,515
And listen...they've asked
me to pay the hostel fee next week.

617
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,084
Please tell brother to pay it.

618
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,511
Yes, I..

619
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,516
I've to make an urgent call.

620
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,587
Enough!

621
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,312
Break her face!

622
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,721
<i>Heyâ€œ</i>

623
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,027
Seen a girl in a blue shirt?

624
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,308
So? Are you scared now?

625
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,432
Please forgive me.

626
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,146
I've already wasted
three years of my college.

627
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,817
Now if I thrash you people too,
I'll get in trouble again.

628
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,410
What?

629
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,721
I see...you were hiding here,
so you don't thrash us.

630
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,122
Stop talking to her.

631
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,123
I don't want to fight.

632
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,157
Listen to me.

633
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,734
Please tell them,
was it my fault?

634
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,235
You were picking on me for no reason.

635
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,267
We'll go, just wait a minute.

636
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,206
David, Pooja said
you were looking for me.

637
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,732
Nothing important.

638
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:39,076
You always used to listen to music
on your phone, with the headphones.

639
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,444
Where is it? I don't see it.

640
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,307
My phone's been stolen.

641
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,113
I went to wash my
face and it disappeared.

642
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,151
I even made an entry
in the 'Missing' register.

643
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,156
Why? What happened?
- Nothing.

644
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,316
Just asked.

645
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,652
I'll tell you if I find it.
- Okay. - Thank you.

646
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,728
Okay.

647
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,439
The college wants to
catch him red-handed, sir.

648
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,102
So, the call I received
was from a stolen phone.

649
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:13,037
This means...whoever stole
the phone is still in the hostel.

650
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,810
And before the hostel guys find him,
we must find him first.

651
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:22,947
You two will keep an eye on Maya's
home, as well as the hostel. - Sir.

652
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,758
Here's your fare.

653
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,937
Hello.
- Sir, it's me.

654
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:41,669
She's here.

655
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,778
Get inside and tie her up.
- Sir, me?

656
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:45,938
I am coming!

657
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,311
Where is she?

658
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:04,591
What happened?

659
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:19,873
You dare record my phone
calls and threaten me?

660
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,410
You wanted to extort money from me?

661
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,620
Me?
- No.

662
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,787
How did you record the call?

663
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,996
Tell me how did you record the call?

664
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,227
With a handycam!

665
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:48,999
Look at me..

666
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:56,451
Where's your handycam?
- Stolen.

667
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,310
What? Stolen?

668
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,820
Someone stole it at the coffee shop.

669
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,618
I didn't see his face.

670
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:15,264
But I know he's a student
at Holy Cross College.

671
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,238
What were you doing
at the coffee shop?

672
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:28,175
What were you doing
at the coffee shop?

673
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,648
Tell me the truth,
or I will break your face.

674
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,119
You won't get another
customer or a lover.

675
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,152
Why did you take the
camera to the coffee shop?

676
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,356
I went to meet a couple of friends.

677
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,093
Did you show them the video?

678
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,947
Did you show them the video?

679
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,193
So three more people know now.

680
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:18,724
She's spoiled it all.

681
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,862
Messed it up!

682
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,907
She's messed us up!

683
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:32,308
Maya!

684
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:36,974
Maya!

685
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:38,516
Maya!

686
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,990
Maya! Maya!

687
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,662
What was the name of the coffee shop?

688
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,395
Coffee shop..

689
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:01,172
Wretch.

690
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,270
Did she say the
name of the coffee shop?

691
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:05,975
She didn't say anything.

692
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:14,582
I'm going through a real bad phase.

693
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,425
Go on.

694
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,326
Madam.

695
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,708
The kohl's completely smeared.

696
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,048
Seems she cried a lot
before committing suicide.

697
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,548
Right, madam. I deduced that too.

698
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,616
She cried her heart out.

699
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:24,682
She... looks tense too.

700
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,592
This is definitely a suicide.

701
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:30,456
Her cheeks are swollen too.

702
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,699
Maybe someone beat
her up and made her cry.

703
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,460
And then hung her.

704
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:46,108
But, madam, the...
door's locked from inside.

705
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:50,347
Manik, you're so naive.

706
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:54,853
Locking the door from inside...
is an old grandfather's technique.

707
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,627
The computer's hard disk is missing.

708
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,022
Her cellphone isn't here either.

709
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,126
There was a charger in the bedroom,
did you see it?

710
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,329
You mean that cellphone charger.

711
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:14,307
It's not a cellphone charger,
it's a video-camera charger.

712
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,908
There's a charger,
but no camera.

713
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:22,807
Is this Plot No. 401-C?

714
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,576
Who is he?
- Courier, madam.

715
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,213
Come here.

716
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,592
Sign.

717
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,056
Thank you, sir.

718
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,729
What is it, madam?
- Credit card bill.

719
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:48,107
Beauty parlour,
pub, supermarket, coffee shop.

720
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,171
She swiped her card
in these four places.

721
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,282
Find out where she visited regularly.

722
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,813
Did she go alone or with friends?

723
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,148
Find out more details about her.

724
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,621
Keep this.
- Yes, ma'am.

725
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,822
Actually, Manik, give that to me.
I'll keep it.

726
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:12,423
Call the forensic people, ask them
when they can get here. - Yes.

727
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,494
I think something's wrong.

728
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:17,905
Maybe it's a murder.

729
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:22,668
Looks like it's the handiwork
of at least 3 to 4 people.

730
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,771
Fine, you make the call...

731
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,407
...until then I'll
question the neighbors.

732
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,542
Yes, ma'am.

733
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:45,700
Bloody Rabia...always honest
- that too on a police salary.

734
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:52,370
We can't shut her
up with a share either.

735
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:02,479
You will only follow this case...
and no acting smart.

736
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,912
Rabia should never find outâ€œ

737
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,319
...that we're involved in this case.

738
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,316
Sir.

739
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:15,760
Let's see how far she
Gets, with that baby in her tummy.

740
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:09,984
Manik.
- Yes, ma'am.

741
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:14,315
We couldn't locate Maya's
buddies in the coffee shop, right?

742
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:15,856
Well, I just got their address.

743
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:18,188
Note it down.
- Madam?

744
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,955
Note it down.
- Y-Yes, ma'am.

745
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:27,229
House No. 3, Yamuna Nagar,
Malad East.

746
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:34,808
Sir..
- Where are you taking us?

747
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:35,808
Don't worry.

748
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:37,845
Please, sir, we're getting worried.
- We'll tell you everything.

749
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:39,345
Sir..
- Come on, get it.

750
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,315
It's nothing,
it will be over in 10 minutes.

751
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,817
Where are you taking us, sir?

752
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,581
Get in, come on.

753
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,320
Yes, Manik.

754
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:57,591
Madam, I found two guys at
the address you gave me.

755
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,995
They willingly got in
the car without any hassle.

756
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,902
But as soon as the car
slowed down at the bend..

757
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:06,406
...they jumped out and escaped.

758
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:11,312
We tried catching them, but..
- I see.

759
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:17,912
See you there, we'll discuss this.
- Okay, madam.

760
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:39,030
Well, for now,
my life-calling is to go to classes.

761
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,936
Going to Churchgate;
can I drop you someplace?

762
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,669
Thanks.

763
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,715
Okay. See you.
- Bye.

764
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,758
Akira. Take a seat.

765
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,988
How's college? All okay?

766
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,026
Good.

767
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,371
By the way, does anyone in college
know that you've been to jail..

768
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,806
I mean...
that you were in the Remand Home.

769
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,111
No!

770
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,441
That's a good thing.

771
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:24,975
Who knows how they'll
behave once they find out.

772
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,685
By the way, no one from
my family knows about this.

773
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,092
The other day,
the police came home..

774
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:34,150
...just for Sid's
passport verification.

775
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,230
And dad was very uncomfortable.

776
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,725
If he finds out about all this, then..

777
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:45,436
You can keep meeting Sid,
talk to him, be friends..

778
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:49,800
...but if things go beyond that,
it'll be a problem for all.

779
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,036
No?

780
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:05,151
Don't worry, that won't happen.

781
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,356
You won't have any
problems because of me.

782
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:13,134
Hope I didn't hurt you.

783
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,264
It's not that easy to hurt me.

784
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:35,581
Bapurao.

785
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,520
Yes, sir.

786
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:39,426
The college is closed for vacations.
- Yes.

787
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,289
Who's going to stay in the hostel now?

788
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,059
We've been standing
out here like madmen.

789
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,461
Madam, please listen.
- Who are you guys?

790
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,494
How did you get in?
Isn't the watchman inside?

791
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,526
We came here to meet a student,
but didn't realize it's the holidays.

792
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,270
Are you alone in the hostel?
- Yes.

793
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:26,999
I see..
- Who do you want to meet?

794
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,570
I..
- Riya.

795
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,204
She studies in B.Com, third year.

796
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:33,870
What's her room number?

797
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:36,614
Isn't this the model
we've been looking for?

798
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,544
Please keep it back,
it's not mine.

799
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:44,219
How much did you pay for this camera?
- I told you this is not mine.

800
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:45,418
Please keep it back.

801
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,128
ACP sir's number on the dialing list.

802
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,658
What? ACP who?

803
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,335
Is this your bag?
It was lying outside.

804
00:59:58,294 --> 00:59:59,671
"Listen, I made a mistake."

805
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,608
"When I hit him with the jack.."

806
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,871
Come with us.
- Where? Who are you?

807
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:11,215
Come on!

808
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,151
"Don't you get it?"

809
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,248
"It's an official call."

810
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:18,391
"Hello..."

811
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,193
Sir, she's out to get us.

812
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,556
During the college strike,
she gave the file to the commissioner.

813
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:27,031
Did you ask her, did she
make more copies of this video?

814
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,870
We searched her room,
but found nothing.

815
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,637
And did she tell anyone about this?
What did she say?

816
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:35,942
The same old thing..

817
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,978
"This isn't my bag,
I don't know where it came from".

818
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:45,009
If these three spill
the beans to anyone.

819
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:48,588
...then we'll lose
everything we've made so far.

820
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,221
We must do something quickly.

821
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,429
Plus I've to go to Nasik..

822
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,396
...for a very boring session
with the Home Minister.

823
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,229
Could take a few days.

824
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:05,028
And it could be dangerous
to keep them alive for three days.

825
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:10,169
I suggest...that you
end this whole thing.

826
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,438
Don't wait for me to return.

827
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,514
Remember our usual spot?
- Go.

828
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:29,585
Sir...we haven't done anything.

829
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:30,892
Come on, get down.
- Where are you taking us?

830
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,465
Keep walking down.

831
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:35,297
Come on..

832
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:36,597
We haven't done anything, sir..

833
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:37,467
Sir..

834
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:38,230
Trying to be a hero?

835
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:38,863
Where..

836
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:40,539
Come on.

837
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,070
Sir..

838
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,075
Come on.

839
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:44,076
Come on.

840
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:44,770
Sit down.

841
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:49,071
Shut up!
- Sir..

842
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:50,216
Stop crying-

843
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,052
Here..
- Sir... no!

844
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:57,818
Sir, no.
- Kill them.

845
01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:58,992
Take it.

846
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:10,237
Stop crying-

847
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,932
No...
- Sir..

848
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,342
Bloody dog,
don't you get it?

849
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,608
Don't answer that now.
- ACP sir is calling.

850
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:24,616
No... no..

851
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:27,779
Yes, sir.
- You got the wrong girl, Manik.

852
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:28,947
She's not that girl.

853
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:32,615
But, sir..

854
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:37,058
Stealing stuff from the hostel,
and making threat calls to me...

855
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,393
...was done by someone else.

856
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:39,990
Don't shoot her.
- Sir..

857
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:40,997
Sir..

858
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,759
Sir, my battery's almost dead.

859
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:46,204
Call on Rajeshwar's cell.
- I didn't bring my mobile.

860
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:49,108
Sir..
- What does he want?

861
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,503
The phone's switched off.
No charge.

862
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,808
Leave it..
Let's finish the job first.

863
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:55,414
Shoot them.

864
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,015
Shoot.

865
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,489
Sir, maybe we got the wrong girl.
- What?

866
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:04,149
Yes.

867
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:05,988
That's why sir asked us to wait.

868
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:09,585
She's not that girl.

869
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,063
I haven't done anything!

870
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:16,468
Bloody lunatic,
why does he keep changing the plan?

871
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,040
And he's saying this now.

872
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,703
Shoot her. We'll deal with this later.
Shoot!

873
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:27,076
Sir, I am confused.

874
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,074
He said "Don't shoot",
you're saying "Shoot".

875
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,210
Sir, what if this
gets us in trouble later?

876
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,686
You're always so eager
to answer the phone.

877
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:37,149
I answered only because
ACP sir was calling.

878
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:39,591
To hell with your ACP!

879
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:44,054
He must be relaxing at home.

880
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,198
And out here,
we're dealing with the mess.

881
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,870
Bloody..

882
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,439
What's he asking us to do?

883
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,404
Let's call him.

884
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:04,376
Go.

885
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:07,181
I need Bapurao with me.

886
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:08,954
Why?

887
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,120
Sir, to drive the van.

888
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:14,626
Go.

889
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:17,762
Come on, start the van.
- Yes.

890
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,869
Come on.

891
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,334
We've orders to let you go.

892
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:35,782
But you must keep quiet
until they don't return.

893
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:46,791
Sir, it's Manik.

894
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:51,826
According to Bapurao's list,
the thefts started last year in March.

895
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,431
And this girl joined now in July.

896
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,932
You fools got the wrong girl.

897
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:59,233
The details are clearly given
in the list along with the dates.

898
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,501
You just make a copy, bring it to me..

899
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,633
...never read it,
eat snacks off of it!

900
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:04,010
Let her go.

901
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,442
But, sir...we killed a guy
in front of her.

902
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,214
How can we let her go?

903
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:17,584
Kill all of them.
- Okay, sir.

904
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,425
Now what?

905
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,862
What's going on?

906
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,173
Bloody..

907
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,344
The belt's broken.

908
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,317
What a piece of junk!

909
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:56,696
Sir... he says that the
garage is six kilometers away.

910
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,027
Give me your walky.
- Yes.

911
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:05,031
Hello...hello, Rajeshwar sir.

912
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,240
Hello...hello, Rajeshwar sir.

913
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,901
Hello..

914
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,103
He's not in range.

915
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,942
He's all alone out there.

916
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:23,088
I think... if we travel
two kilometers back..

917
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,751
...then his walky will be in range.

918
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,088
Yes.

919
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,298
Hello.

920
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,235
Hello... Rajeshwar sir.

921
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:52,144
Rajeshwar sir, can you hear me?

922
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,019
Rajeshwar sir.

923
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:58,257
Hello.

924
01:06:58,781 --> 01:06:59,623
What happened?

925
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,394
The van's belt got broken.

926
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:02,963
What do I do about them?

927
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,892
We've orders to shoot them all.

928
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:06,759
Hello...sir, did you hear?

929
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,267
Bloody..

930
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,032
Hello, sir.

931
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:03,487
Hello.

932
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:07,925
Hello... Rajeshwar sir.

933
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:11,722
Hello... Rajeshwar sir.

934
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:14,997
Rajeshwar sir.

935
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:29,309
"I've a meeting with the minister."

936
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,579
He said he has to go...

937
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,115
and sent us here instead.

938
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,853
So that he's safe.

939
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:36,980
He's a bloody fraud.

940
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,826
Couldn't he check the
list properly earlier?

941
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,521
Messed everything up by
calling us in the middle of the job.

942
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:46,655
Let's get that girl
before she talks to anyone.

943
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:53,437
You're saying...you saw one
of the police officers before?

944
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,600
Yes, Father.

945
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,108
He was there during the strike.

946
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:09,454
Hello, Andrew, how are you?
- James, I want to meet right now.

947
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:10,286
Where are you?

948
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:13,259
I am in Pune...for a court hearing.

949
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:13,985
What is it?

950
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:17,326
There's a problem in college.
- I see...what's wrong?

951
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,428
Not on the phone,
let's talk face-to-face.

952
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:23,197
Just get here as soon
as you can tomorrow morning.

953
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:23,963
Okay.

954
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,336
Fine, let's meet in the morning.
- Okay, bye. Thanks.

955
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:29,970
May I go, Father?

956
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:32,073
I am not staying
at the hostel tonight.

957
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,338
I'll be here tomorrow morning.

958
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:35,712
Well, if there's a problem,
you can stay here.

959
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,941
There's no problem, Father.

960
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,049
I am going to my brother's home.

961
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:41,088
I'll be here by tomorrow by 7 am.
- Okay.

962
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:44,588
I'll drop you at the station.

963
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,217
It's close by, Father.
I'll manage on my own.

964
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:58,994
Yes.

965
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:01,840
Papa, that's my sister, Akira.

966
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,506
Come in, Akira.

967
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:05,470
That's not the sari.

968
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:06,842
Then where is it?
There's one less.

969
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,074
Mom's inside.
- Count again.

970
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,481
But you guys must
book a Cool Cab firstâ€œ

971
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,878
...so that you all get there on time.

972
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:13,420
How's the place?

973
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:14,613
Well, it's a great place.

974
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,851
You? So suddenly? What happened?

975
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:26,728
Who are all these people?

976
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,467
They are Shilpa's relatives.

977
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:31,571
Her cousin's getting married.

978
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,738
They've come from Pune.

979
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:33,802
Something to eat?

980
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:38,768
What happened?

981
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,242
Did you get into a fight?

982
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,781
No, the door slammed on my face.

983
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:44,840
How can the door..

984
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,280
Wait, I'll put something on it.
- Mom!

985
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,612
I said it's nothing, let it be.

986
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:53,726
Akira, did you pay
your hostel mess' fee?

987
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:00,932
Pay it tomorrow.

988
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:05,733
I want to talk to you.
- Say it.

989
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:06,670
Ajay.

990
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,869
Ajay.
- What happened?

991
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,706
Check this bill. Something's wrong.
- What happened?

992
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,336
We selected 12 saris, didn't we?
- Yeah.

993
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,709
They billed us for 13 saris.

994
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:14,406
How's that possible?

995
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,983
Well...I chose 5 silk saris,
but I don't know about the rest.

996
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,547
But I..
- You settled the bill.

997
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:19,984
Yes.
- You must have counted the saris.

998
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,248
Maybe I checked..
- Did you count them or not?

999
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,050
No, I forgot.
- You didn't count the saris, Ajay.

1000
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:25,250
But.. - How can you do such a thing?
- You check it.

1001
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:26,917
There's no problem.

1002
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,593
I kept telling you.
- Let me show you.

1003
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,496
These are the ones that I counted.

1004
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:34,124
These are Ritu's saris.

1005
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:35,634
And I already gave aunty her saris.

1006
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:36,294
Right?

1007
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,304
There are two 'Chanderis' here..

1008
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,306
...and those five silk saris
which I packed myself. - Okay.

1009
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:41,136
What's the total?

1010
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,504
12, AjaV---Â°"I'/ 12-

1011
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:43,907
How can you pay for 13?

1012
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:00,457
Have you seen this girl?

1013
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:02,290
She just left.. that way.

1014
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:07,596
"Eyes have not been
get wet for a long time."

1015
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:12,533
"There is life from this pretext."

1016
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:17,674
"Eyes have not been
get wet for a long time."

1017
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:22,678
"There is life from this pretext."

1018
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,819
"Slowly slowly rain comes and fills."

1019
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,885
Siddharth, it's Akira.
- Hi.

1020
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,554
Can we meet now?
- No, I just finished work.

1021
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:31,590
I am on my way back from Pune.

1022
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,622
Was it something urgent?
- No.

1023
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:36,856
Say it.
- No, it's okay.

1024
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:37,897
Hello.

1025
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:42,300
"I am desert,
you fill me with water."

1026
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:45,334
"There eyes clouds.."

1027
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:50,639
"There eyes clouds.."

1028
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,269
Give the fried rice
to the kids standing there.

1029
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:21,730
Okay.

1030
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:24,500
Thank you.

1031
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,474
Bring that plate.

1032
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:28,612
Okay. - I don't believe it, man.
- Clean that table.

1033
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,377
He's always staring at me.

1034
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,643
Seriously, he's crazy.

1035
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:36,018
Did you keep that bag in
front of my room at the hostel?

1036
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,648
Hello...what bag?

1037
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,424
I am talking to you, Niki.

1038
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:43,224
Listen,
I've been keeping my distance.

1039
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:44,730
I don't know about any bag.

1040
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,094
Then who kept that bag?

1041
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,895
She said she doesn't know anything.

1042
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,701
Don't touch me.

1043
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,296
I am warning you, Niki...
don't mess with me.

1044
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,969
Do you know the trouble
you've caused me?

1045
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,900
Wretch...how dare you hit me?

1046
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,671
Sir, even the other day
you were mistaken.. - Shut up!

1047
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,376
Bapurao,
arrest everyone and lock them up!

1048
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:05,548
Come on.

1049
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,113
Sorry, sir.
- Come on.

1050
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:08,154
What are you looking at?

1051
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,019
Come on...get in.
- Sir...

1052
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,981
Come on...get in.

1053
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:14,520
Sujata, stop staring..

1054
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:15,751
...and lock the girls up in Cell No. 2.

1055
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:16,626
Get in.

1056
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:18,689
I want to call home.

1057
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:21,598
Make a call! Get in..

1058
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:26,830
Didn't I tell you,
I'd catch her?

1059
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,605
I ask you to get one girl;
but you get the whole college!

1060
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:31,801
Botched up the game!

1061
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:35,515
Sir, I thought.
- Don't think. Please.

1062
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:38,307
Now I'll do whatever needs to be done.

1063
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:40,613
Bapurao.
- Sir.

1064
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,853
Come on...come outâ€œ

1065
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,082
Come on.

1066
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,386
Come on.

1067
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,120
Not you. You stay there.

1068
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,194
Listen, everyone.

1069
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,628
No one talks about her outside.

1070
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:51,994
Or I'll lock you all up again.

1071
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:56,760
We can't kill her now.

1072
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,537
Her college friends
have seen her here.

1073
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:09,613
And there's no telling
what she's said to whom.

1074
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:11,411
So what now, sir?

1075
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:14,218
I'll tell you.

1076
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:20,822
Hi...

1077
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:22,226
How's your mom?

1078
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,696
All well.

1079
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,198
Good morning, Father.

1080
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,669
Swipe for both the cars.

1081
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:39,735
Okay, sir.

1082
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:45,574
Ajay, sorry to disturb you.

1083
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:48,820
Has Akira left for college?

1084
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,016
Yes, Father,
she left for the hostel last night.

1085
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,422
Why? What's wrong?

1086
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:55,659
Her room's locked..

1087
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:58,525
...and she hasn't appeared for the
college's internal exams either.

1088
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,189
What?

1089
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:00,961
Did she tell you anything?

1090
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,067
No.

1091
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:05,902
Last night she was trying
to tell me something..

1092
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,132
...but, she..

1093
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,869
Ask everyone she knows.

1094
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:12,739
And let me know if you speak to Akira.

1095
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,542
Sure, Father.
- Don't forget.

1096
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:16,616
Definitely, Father.
I'll call right now.

1097
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:17,775
I'll just call you back.

1098
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:21,553
Brother-in-law. - Akira hasn't
gone to the hostel since last night.

1099
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,954
What?
- Her principal just called.

1100
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,120
I'll call my volunteers,
ask them to find out.

1101
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:27,159
We'll find her.

1102
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:30,058
Let's file a missing complaint.

1103
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:33,996
And we'll ask my advocate friend..

1104
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:38,903
...how to include that Inspector Manik,
whom she mentioned.

1105
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,571
Sir, a missing complaint's been filed.

1106
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:49,611
And Manik's name has been included.

1107
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:57,154
I told you we'd get in deep trouble.

1108
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,223
I just spoke with them.

1109
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,230
But they are saying the same thing.

1110
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,103
"We'll let you know once we find out."

1111
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:20,411
Hello.

1112
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:22,276
Sir..

1113
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:23,338
Speak up.

1114
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,813
Sir, we did exactly what you told us.

1115
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:30,856
After this...we won't face any
more problems because of that girl.

1116
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:33,584
All clear, sir.

1117
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:01,650
Stop.

1118
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:08,692
Okay, that's enough for today.

1119
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:10,261
Give her a dose.

1120
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:12,292
When she's conscious again after
four hours.

1121
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:13,127
We'll do it once again.

1122
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:13,926
Yes, doctor.

1123
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:24,510
I'll never talk to you again.
Never.

1124
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:25,408
Understand?

1125
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:29,037
How dare you take my doll?

1126
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:30,809
Don't make a racket.

1127
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:32,676
Come, Kamla. It's your turn.

1128
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:35,152
I won't take a bath.

1129
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,386
Only mad people bathe every day.

1130
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:40,823
You know, I have a shampoo as well.

1131
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,290
What color?
- Yellow.

1132
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:45,763
I don't like yellow.

1133
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:50,394
I...like this green.
- I've green too.

1134
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,772
So...shall we go?
- Come on.

1135
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:53,896
Let's go.

1136
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:57,766
Are you a doctor?
- No, we're not doctors.

1137
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:01,975
Then, are you like us?
- Yes, of course.

1138
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:04,344
Then why don't you
wear clothes like us?

1139
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:07,615
We wear such clothes. We like green.

1140
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:14,857
Crazy girl
- that's 'red', not 'green'.

1141
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:19,493
Bedsheets...blanket...green
shampoo. - Okay.

1142
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,692
And I was just..

1143
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:23,900
What happened?

1144
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,365
Kirti? What happened?

1145
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:33,335
Akira?

1146
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,612
Akira!

1147
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:37,478
Akira!
- Akira!

1148
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,014
Hello.

1149
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:51,297
But, Rane sir..
- Don't worry, Doctor.

1150
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:54,027
Rajeshwar will be there soon.

1151
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:57,168
Remember, no one should
get suspicious until then.

1152
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,101
Okay.

1153
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:34,771
Hello.

1154
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:36,775
Hello.

1155
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:42,045
Hello, this is Amitabh
Bachchan speaking. - Listen.

1156
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:43,272
Okay.

1157
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:45,078
This is Rani speaking.

1158
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,751
Can you ask the ten-million
rupee question first?

1159
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,355
Come here.

1160
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:52,588
Come here.

1161
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:56,259
Don't get me wrong,
I was just kidding.

1162
01:20:57,919 --> 01:20:59,091
What is this place?

1163
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,229
This is a big..
- What's the time?

1164
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,128
Who is the in-charge here?

1165
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:04,761
Get lost.

1166
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,066
Come on..

1167
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,629
Get back to general ward.

1168
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:08,764
Madam, what is this place?

1169
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:12,078
Get back.

1170
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:13,145
Who are you?

1171
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:14,974
Sit.

1172
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,379
What are you doing?
- Sit down.

1173
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:18,850
Hold her.

1174
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:22,719
What is this?

1175
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:28,626
Come on.

1176
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:55,512
Get up. Look this way.

1177
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,185
Akira.
- Akira.

1178
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:05,859
Get up.

1179
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:08,662
Look this way.

1180
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,450
Did this girl take drugs?

1181
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:35,387
Drugs?
" Yes?

1182
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:38,255
Not at all.

1183
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:41,165
No, sir.

1184
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:42,667
And what kind of a question is that?

1185
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:44,965
Hold on, Sid.
Let me talk.

1186
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:49,567
May I know what Akira's done?

1187
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,803
What did she do?

1188
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:52,770
She did this.

1189
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:54,976
She hurled a stone at me.

1190
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:56,571
At a police officer.

1191
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,576
It missed my eye
just because I ducked.

1192
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,988
What day was it? And where?

1193
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:09,852
Last Tuesday at around 11 pm,
I was on patrol duty.

1194
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:12,793
I noticed her from afar.

1195
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:18,531
As soon as she saw me,
she started behaving strangely.

1196
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:23,003
She came up to me and
asked "Are you Manik?"

1197
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,975
Why are you roaming here in disguise?

1198
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,202
I thought to myself
that something is wrong.

1199
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:30,046
I got down from my bike,
and was parking it..

1200
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:32,345
â€œWhen she hurled a stone at me.

1201
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:36,583
Thankfully I ducked,
but it hit my head and I fell down.

1202
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:37,679
I arrested her immediately..

1203
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,656
...and brought her to the
police station to file an FIR.

1204
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:42,727
But even at the police station..

1205
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:46,230
...she kept saying
to the entire staff..

1206
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:50,168
"Four police officers
were trying to kill me."

1207
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,966
"They killed two boys but I escaped."

1208
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:57,105
I knew it's a charade.

1209
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,910
Or she's mentally ill.

1210
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:07,245
Ma'am, did she ever hit
her head when she was a kid?

1211
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:11,381
Any such incident...
which could explain this behavior?

1212
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,024
It happened long ago.

1213
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:19,598
She threw acid on a boy's face.

1214
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:22,798
She was sent to a
children's remand home.

1215
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:25,736
She even stayed there.
- That's it.

1216
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:27,596
Didn't I say something's wrong?

1217
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:29,333
Something's definitely wrong.

1218
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:31,808
That's why I immediately
brought her to the docton.

1219
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,538
I mean psychiatrist, for treatment.

1220
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:35,046
And the tests were positive.

1221
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:37,377
What's the actual problem?

1222
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:41,747
She's affected by recurrent
persistent delusion. Type 2.

1223
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:44,882
In simpler words, such patients.

1224
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:49,325
...always gets confused
between reality and fantasy.

1225
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:52,655
They believe one of their fantasies
to be true, and starts reacting.

1226
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:55,725
Akira believes that the
police are following her..

1227
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:58,031
...and they'll kill
her in an encounter.

1228
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:02,871
Due to this imagination, she's
behaving strangely amongst people.

1229
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,211
No...no need to worry.

1230
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:08,872
She'll be fine soon.

1231
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:12,208
It's okay, mom...it's okay.

1232
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,044
They're saying she'll be okay.

1233
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:16,719
It's okay, mom.

1234
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:21,724
Now eat.

1235
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:22,823
You must finish all of it.

1236
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:24,021
Come on, eat.

1237
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:26,964
You'll get more, now eat.

1238
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:28,825
Your sit here. Sit here.

1239
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:31,066
First finish this.

1240
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:33,470
Come on, eat.

1241
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:35,803
You'll get water, wait.

1242
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,212
Eat from your plate.

1243
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:51,522
Hey...go away
Go! <i>'</i>

1244
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:07,395
Akira.

1245
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,032
Are you okay?

1246
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:40,739
"Someone cast an evil eye on me, my

1247
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:43,535
Hello.

1248
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:47,869
Did you eat breakfast?

1249
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:49,543
What's the time?

1250
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:54,683
How long have you
been in this hospital?

1251
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:00,450
Almost two years..
I keep coming and going.

1252
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:04,520
It's been going on like that.

1253
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,724
Is it difficult to get out of here?

1254
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:12,670
Well...it's very difficult
to leave with permission.

1255
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,708
But without permission...
it's less difficult.

1256
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,011
Can you do something for me?

1257
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:34,489
Hello, Father. I am SP Rabiya.

1258
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:35,755
Mumbai Crime Branch.

1259
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:38,587
Please sit.

1260
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:50,206
Well...there's a coffee shop,
close to your college.

1261
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:51,800
Around 500 meters away.

1262
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,147
I am sure you know.
- Yes, I know.

1263
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:59,147
On the 25th of last month..

1264
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:02,814
...12 students from your college
celebrated a birthday there.

1265
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:05,887
And one of them stole a handycam..

1266
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:09,019
â€œFrom a customer's bag.

1267
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:11,591
Go back..

1268
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:14,259
Later I saw the coffee
shop's CCTV footage.

1269
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:16,059
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

1270
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:17,397
Out of those 12 students.

1271
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:19,699
...that one girl could be
seen stealing the camera.

1272
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:22,638
But we couldn't see her face,
she was wearing a cap.

1273
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,273
So I started looking
for all the students..

1274
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:26,073
...whose faces could
be seen in the video.

1275
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,511
She's a 2nd year, Commerce Student.

1276
01:28:27,568 --> 01:28:30,412
And that's Bharat,
3rd year Mathematics student.

1277
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:32,542
And he's a...2nd year
Mathematics student as well.

1278
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:33,449
And who's this? This girl?

1279
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,349
She's Ana.

1280
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:35,649
The Principal's daughter.

1281
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:37,045
Ana?

1282
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:48,997
I want to see the handycam
which your daughter stole.

1283
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,142
Hi.

1284
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:09,349
Did you go to the coffee
shop with your friends?

1285
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:12,151
When?

1286
01:29:12,814 --> 01:29:14,191
Which coffee shop?

1287
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:16,990
You've been caught red-handed.

1288
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:20,298
You've been caught stealing.
- Sir!

1289
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:25,434
You've been caught stealing on camera.
- Sir...please..

1290
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:29,570
You've ruined my name and respect.

1291
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:31,205
How will I face the students?

1292
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:34,576
Go get the handycam you
stole from the coffee shop.

1293
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:37,513
I want to see it.
- I am ruined..

1294
01:29:41,175 --> 01:29:45,248
In a way, I'm the one
who encouraged this thief.

1295
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,624
In every meeting in the hostel..

1296
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:50,094
...I would tell the students, that..

1297
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:54,064
"Whoever is committing these thefts
in the hostel should mend their ways."

1298
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:58,804
"And keep everything
that's stolen in a bag.."

1299
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,466
"..and leave it
anywhere in the hostel."

1300
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:04,475
"We won't take any
action against this person."

1301
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:30,330
'I didn't know that the
thief's living in our own home.'

1302
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:33,568
"Go, die somewhere."

1303
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:35,841
'The college was
shut down for holidays...

1304
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,807
'...when I discovered...'

1305
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,436
'...that my own
daughter was the thief'

1306
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:45,075
'All the students had gone home.
Only Akira was staying in the hostel.'

1307
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:48,643
'That's why I left
that bag outside her room.'

1308
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:53,021
'So that when Akira
finds the bag outside her room..'

1309
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,616
'..she'd bring it to me immediately.'

1310
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:58,494
Then I would've told everyone that the
thief has returned everyone's stuff.

1311
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:01,124
And I would've distributed
everything back through the warden.

1312
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:03,396
And this problem could've been solved.

1313
01:31:04,225 --> 01:31:06,728
But Akira didn't show up that night.

1314
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:09,472
Next day when I went to the hostel,
the room was locked.

1315
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:13,138
That same night, Akira came home..

1316
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:17,378
...and said that there was
a bag lying outside her room.

1317
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:21,584
As she opened to take a look,
two policemen arrived.

1318
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:28,125
They took the handycam and mobile from
the bag, and kidnapped her as well.

1319
01:31:28,216 --> 01:31:35,964
And they took two boys along,
whom they killed.

1320
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,027
Only Akira survived.

1321
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:43,506
After Akira left, I asked her again..

1322
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:48,144
...and she admitted to stealing
the handycam from the coffee shop.

1323
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:53,246
And also told me about
the foolishness she did by keeping it.

1324
01:31:56,844 --> 01:32:02,624
I study hard as well...
but it's never enough for dad.

1325
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:07,389
He never missed a single
opportunity to insult me.

1326
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,658
He even hit me in front of my friends.

1327
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:16,937
Finally I got fed up,
and did all this to hurt him.

1328
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:20,807
And unknowingly, it became a habit.

1329
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:24,950
Sorry.

1330
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:29,013
You said sorry so easily.

1331
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:34,722
Do you how many lives
your childishness has ruined?

1332
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:47,804
He plays well.

1333
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:09,954
He'll whack any ball.

1334
01:33:15,222 --> 01:33:16,895
Want to bet?

1335
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:18,698
We're definitely losing.

1336
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:24,240
Look, he hit the shot.

1337
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:28,469
Didn't I tell you?

1338
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:25,593
HE'!-

1339
01:34:25,926 --> 01:34:26,734
Stop!

1340
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:27,805
What are you doing?

1341
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:31,068
Stop.

1342
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:33,267
Why you...

1343
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:18,824
Stop.

1344
01:35:18,913 --> 01:35:20,392
Hey, swP-

1345
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:22,323
Stop.

1346
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:53,979
Ajaymfiijay, what is all this?

1347
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:57,449
Your sister's standing outside
our door in such a strange condition.

1348
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:58,580
Akira!

1349
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:03,154
Akira! What are you doing here?

1350
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:06,796
Ajay, I want to talk to you alone.

1351
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:10,165
Akira...what are you doing here?

1352
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:12,166
You're under treatment, aren't you?
How can you...

1353
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:15,935
Nothing's wrong with me, mom.
- We know nothing's wrong with you.

1354
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:17,771
But you must finish your treatment.

1355
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:21,370
There's nothing wrong with me,
so why should I get treatment?

1356
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:31,817
Ajay, please listen to me.
- Fine, tell me.

1357
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:38,257
Last Tuesday I came here.
- Not Tuesday, you came on Wednesday.

1358
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:39,626
Yes..
- One day before the wedding.

1359
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:40,722
I did come on Wednesday too.

1360
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:42,198
But I came one day before that too.

1361
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:43,929
You and mom were not at home.

1362
01:37:44,491 --> 01:37:45,834
You can ask Shilpa.

1363
01:37:46,227 --> 01:37:47,797
That day, when you were upset with me.

1364
01:37:48,162 --> 01:37:49,197
Tell them.

1365
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:51,342
But, Akira,
why would Shilpa be upset with you?

1366
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:54,102
Ask her later, but
when I went back ..

1367
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:56,307
...there was a bag
lying outside my room.

1368
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:59,044
As soon as I opened it,
two policemen barged in!

1369
01:37:59,139 --> 01:38:00,914
Yes, we know. Father told us.

1370
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:02,710
Because I told Father.

1371
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:04,912
That day, after I escaped
from that encounter spot..

1372
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:06,424
...I met Father first.

1373
01:38:06,647 --> 01:38:08,126
And then I came here.

1374
01:38:08,415 --> 01:38:11,157
Akira, none of this happened.

1375
01:38:11,452 --> 01:38:14,433
It's just your delusion.

1376
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:19,566
Why will the police
try to kill you, Akira?

1377
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:22,900
I mean...there's no reason.

1378
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:27,674
The inspector whom you assaulted,
took you to the psychiatrist.

1379
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:31,342
That doctor checked you..
- That bloody doctor...is a liar.

1380
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:33,976
They want to help you, dear.
- Help me?

1381
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:38,114
Unbelievable, mom.
They want to drive me crazy.

1382
01:38:38,178 --> 01:38:41,022
Just tell me how you got here.

1383
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:41,559
Catch her!

1384
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:42,184
From the hospital.

1385
01:38:42,249 --> 01:38:43,819
She beat us up and escaped!
Catch her.

1386
01:38:43,884 --> 01:38:44,828
Hold on.
- No.

1387
01:38:44,885 --> 01:38:45,795
Akira, no.
- Akira.

1388
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:47,389
They give me electric shocks..
- No.

1389
01:38:47,454 --> 01:38:48,455
Akira.

1390
01:38:48,622 --> 01:38:49,828
Leave me.

1391
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:51,430
Careful.

1392
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:52,664
AjaY-- Ajay, no!

1393
01:38:52,726 --> 01:38:54,763
Mom..
- Akira, just listen to them.

1394
01:38:54,862 --> 01:38:56,068
Don't let them take me!

1395
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:58,667
Calm down, dear.
- Save me, mom.

1396
01:38:58,732 --> 01:39:01,645
All will be well.
- No!

1397
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:04,782
Be brave.
- They...give me shocks...

1398
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:06,874
Electric shocks...

1399
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:09,852
She's calmed down.

1400
01:39:14,648 --> 01:39:15,991
Get the wheelchair.

1401
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:46,416
Stop.

1402
01:39:59,593 --> 01:40:00,731
Excuse me.

1403
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:02,339
<i>X am SP Rama.</i>

1404
01:40:04,098 --> 01:40:06,374
I want to see a patient called Akira.

1405
01:40:07,468 --> 01:40:08,970
Where's her ward?

1406
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:33,296
Thanks for saving me.

1407
01:40:33,827 --> 01:40:37,468
Who says thanks for
something like that?

1408
01:40:38,899 --> 01:40:41,743
My own family doesn't trust me.

1409
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:47,148
I'm sure everyone in
college thinks I'm crazy too.

1410
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:55,994
Giving you shocks...
and those injections.

1411
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:58,621
...it's the doctor's doing.

1412
01:40:58,685 --> 01:41:02,929
If we catch him,
everythingâ€œ be fine.

1413
01:41:31,819 --> 01:41:32,661
Wear this.

1414
01:41:33,287 --> 01:41:35,767
Wait here.
- Yes, I'll be right here.

1415
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:08,994
Akira...madam.

1416
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:13,802
How could you do
something so cheap?

1417
01:42:15,195 --> 01:42:16,139
Tell me.

1418
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:17,732
Forgive me, please.

1419
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:19,276
Sorry?
- Sorry?

1420
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:20,535
Sorry?

1421
01:42:21,368 --> 01:42:23,712
Sorry

1422
01:42:25,873 --> 01:42:28,683
You're going to say sorry?

1423
01:42:28,942 --> 01:42:31,320
Will your apology
make everything alright?

1424
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:34,117
My own family thinks I'm crazy.

1425
01:42:35,716 --> 01:42:39,027
No, no...no...forgive me.

1426
01:42:39,086 --> 01:42:40,429
Tell me...tell me the truth?

1427
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:44,629
How much did they pay you?
- Madam...they forced me to do this.

1428
01:42:44,691 --> 01:42:46,398
That's why I had to do all this.

1429
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:48,497
If you are right,
why will they force you?

1430
01:42:48,762 --> 01:42:52,574
Few days ago...
a patient died accidentally.

1431
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:54,668
...while I was giving
him shock treatment.

1432
01:42:54,735 --> 01:42:58,649
These cops helped me
in closing that matter smoothly.

1433
01:42:58,739 --> 01:43:00,582
That's all...nothing more.

1434
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,085
Come on. Get up.

1435
01:43:02,142 --> 01:43:04,986
Wear your shirt and come with me.
- Where, madam?

1436
01:43:05,546 --> 01:43:12,259
To tell my family, the principal
and the entire college that you lied.

1437
01:43:15,489 --> 01:43:16,661
He'll me!

1438
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:19,100
Someone help me!

1439
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:20,905
He'll me!

1440
01:43:20,994 --> 01:43:22,337
Please help me.

1441
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:48,994
What did he say?
- He said he's at the club.

1442
01:43:49,256 --> 01:43:50,064
Club.

1443
01:43:50,624 --> 01:43:51,398
Come on.

1444
01:44:22,122 --> 01:44:23,328
Someone's coming.

1445
01:44:25,859 --> 01:44:27,031
Rani, come here.

1446
01:44:39,206 --> 01:44:41,709
Is this the ladies toilet?
- Yes.

1447
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:44,182
Sorry.

1448
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:48,653
What is this man..

1449
01:44:51,685 --> 01:44:54,495
He came in the wrong toilet,
so we beat him up.

1450
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:57,668
Sorry, I had a little too much.

1451
01:44:57,724 --> 01:44:59,567
I'll leave.

1452
01:45:03,096 --> 01:45:04,439
Rani.
- Yes.

1453
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:06,310
Lift him up

1454
01:45:12,372 --> 01:45:13,976
Hello.
- Brother, it's me again.

1455
01:45:14,074 --> 01:45:15,883
Do you have any news yet?

1456
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:16,716
No.

1457
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:19,189
It's been three days.
I've been waiting for him.

1458
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:20,087
Not yet.

1459
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:21,524
Again, the same story!

1460
01:45:21,581 --> 01:45:24,721
Listen.. - A policeman's missing,
and the police has no clue.

1461
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:26,093
How is this possible?

1462
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:28,861
Have faith in me.
- I can trust you, right?

1463
01:45:28,955 --> 01:45:30,366
Absolutely.
- Really?

1464
01:45:30,424 --> 01:45:31,266
Yes.

1465
01:45:45,138 --> 01:45:48,608
Sir... Rajeshwar sir's wife.

1466
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:50,850
She keeps calling
us over and over again.

1467
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:53,717
She's in the village; very frightened.

1468
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:55,351
She wants to come here..

1469
01:45:55,415 --> 01:45:56,621
...and file a 'Missing' complaint.

1470
01:45:58,085 --> 01:46:01,157
I managed her for now, but..

1471
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:05,228
This money mess..

1472
01:46:09,162 --> 01:46:13,110
I've fixed...
my daughter's marriage.

1473
01:46:16,002 --> 01:46:19,176
If Rajeshwar sir spills the beans..

1474
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:23,043
...then I will be ruined, sir.
- Bapurao!

1475
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:25,351
Get up! Get up.

1476
01:46:29,516 --> 01:46:32,258
So what if he's scared?
Will he open his mouth?

1477
01:46:41,828 --> 01:46:44,570
You're making a mistake.
- What?

1478
01:46:45,999 --> 01:46:47,273
I am making a mistake?

1479
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:53,513
You guys turn my life into a joke..

1480
01:46:53,673 --> 01:46:55,584
...and you say I'm making a mistake?

1481
01:46:56,443 --> 01:46:59,151
Should I blow your brains out?

1482
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:05,456
Just because they sent
me to a remand home as a kid..

1483
01:47:05,919 --> 01:47:08,593
...everyone looked down on me.

1484
01:47:09,289 --> 01:47:10,859
And now...this taint of being crazy.

1485
01:47:12,325 --> 01:47:15,534
Just being treated at the mental
hospital means your life is over.

1486
01:47:17,397 --> 01:47:18,671
Why did you people do this to me?

1487
01:47:20,033 --> 01:47:21,944
Why did you people falsely accuse me?
Tell me.

1488
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,879
Madam, these numbers match.

1489
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:31,320
Good, file this separately.

1490
01:47:31,378 --> 01:47:32,322
Okay.

1491
01:47:32,546 --> 01:47:33,889
Take a picture of all this.

1492
01:47:33,947 --> 01:47:34,925
Okay, ma'am.

1493
01:47:35,415 --> 01:47:36,416
Look, ma'am.

1494
01:47:36,483 --> 01:47:37,427
Yes, this one too.

1495
01:47:38,318 --> 01:47:41,128
Get me the details of
the driver of the crashed car.

1496
01:47:41,188 --> 01:47:43,998
Most importantly,
the person who claimed the insurance.

1497
01:47:44,057 --> 01:47:44,762
Okay.

1498
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:03,249
Since we received a complaint
of Rajeshwar's disappearance.

1499
01:48:04,077 --> 01:48:06,148
...these three have been missing too.

1500
01:48:07,914 --> 01:48:10,292
No one at the police
station knows anything either.

1501
01:48:10,584 --> 01:48:12,120
And their cellphones are off too.

1502
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,627
We must arrest them
and keep them inside.

1503
01:48:18,592 --> 01:48:24,099
Yeah...the TV and Press
will humiliate us for a few days.

1504
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:28,107
But we'll handle that.

1505
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:50,529
Hello. - Hello, Siddharth.
Akira speaking.

1506
01:48:50,624 --> 01:48:52,865
Where are you calling from?
- Listen to me carefully.

1507
01:48:52,959 --> 01:48:53,630
Go on.

1508
01:48:53,693 --> 01:48:56,469
The college's annual day
function is tomorrow at 9:30 am.

1509
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:59,270
The entire campus will
gather at the auditorium.

1510
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:02,036
Bring Ajay and mother along,
I'll meet you there.

1511
01:49:02,302 --> 01:49:04,304
Inspector Rajeshwar is with me.

1512
01:49:04,671 --> 01:49:09,279
And he's ready to tell everyone
how these policemen wanted to kill me.

1513
01:49:09,342 --> 01:49:10,446
Okay.

1514
01:49:11,177 --> 01:49:13,521
Who's call is it, Sid?
- Akira.

1515
01:49:14,614 --> 01:49:16,389
Akira...Akira, where are you?

1516
01:49:16,483 --> 01:49:18,986
We're so worried..
- Ajay, I've told Siddharth everything.

1517
01:49:19,085 --> 01:49:20,996
Yeah, but..
- Bring mother along.

1518
01:49:21,955 --> 01:49:25,368
Don't make any excuses.
- Fine, but listen to me..

1519
01:49:25,792 --> 01:49:27,794
Akira...hello.

1520
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:29,467
Hello.

1521
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:34,069
What did she say?

1522
01:49:34,134 --> 01:49:35,078
She..

1523
01:49:38,271 --> 01:49:41,514
Yes, ma'am.
- I am SP Rabiya, Crime Branch.

1524
01:49:41,841 --> 01:49:44,014
"Inspector Rajeshwar is with me."

1525
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:48,820
"He's ready to talk about
how these cops wanted to kill me."

1526
01:49:48,915 --> 01:49:49,893
"When they didn't succeed.."

1527
01:49:49,950 --> 01:49:53,159
"..they proved that I am delusional
with Dr. Santosh Tiwari's help.."

1528
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:55,322
"..and locked me up
at the Thane mental asylum."

1529
01:49:55,555 --> 01:49:57,091
"Rajeshwar has agreed to say this.."

1530
01:49:57,190 --> 01:50:00,797
"..in front of the media,
the court and the entire college."

1531
01:50:01,394 --> 01:50:02,429
Agreed?

1532
01:50:04,097 --> 01:50:05,371
How can he agree?

1533
01:50:05,465 --> 01:50:06,944
I was telling you, sir.

1534
01:50:08,868 --> 01:50:10,108
He must be scared, right?

1535
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:13,781
Sir, we've traced the location
of Rajeshwar sir's mobile.

1536
01:50:14,174 --> 01:50:15,118
The signal was coming from the towen.

1537
01:50:15,175 --> 01:50:16,711
...close to Holy Cross College.

1538
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:22,458
Sir... a lot of students live
around the college as paying guests.

1539
01:50:23,216 --> 01:50:25,423
If she's hiding in
one of those buildings..

1540
01:50:25,485 --> 01:50:27,294
...it'll take days to find her.

1541
01:50:29,322 --> 01:50:31,802
What time is the college
function tomorrow? - 10 am.

1542
01:51:06,726 --> 01:51:08,535
Is that person over
there your principal?

1543
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:09,699
Yes.

1544
01:51:10,797 --> 01:51:12,140
Who's with him?

1545
01:51:12,198 --> 01:51:14,474
Actually...he's the vice-principal.

1546
01:51:38,758 --> 01:51:39,896
Sir.

1547
01:51:40,393 --> 01:51:41,872
Sir, I just saw that mad person..

1548
01:51:41,961 --> 01:51:43,599
...head towards the
building near the ground.

1549
01:51:43,663 --> 01:51:45,506
No one's allowed to go there.

1550
01:51:45,598 --> 01:51:46,406
The structure's too weak. .

1551
01:51:46,466 --> 01:51:49,504
Did you check behind the building?
- No, sir.

1552
01:51:52,505 --> 01:51:54,143
The principal's arrived.

1553
01:51:54,407 --> 01:51:56,478
He's sitting on the front seat.

1554
01:51:57,777 --> 01:52:02,317
You must tell everyone...
exactly what you told me.

1555
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:03,920
Get it?

1556
01:52:04,551 --> 01:52:08,465
If you try to act smart,
I'll shoot you.

1557
01:52:13,526 --> 01:52:14,561
Rani!

1558
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:01,210
Sir!

1559
01:53:02,142 --> 01:53:04,122
She's run out of bullets, sir!

1560
01:53:08,381 --> 01:53:09,883
Quiet.
- Sir!

1561
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:12,654
Come on. Get up.

1562
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,223
Stop!
- Manik.

1563
01:53:16,656 --> 01:53:17,862
Get on your knees!

1564
01:53:18,558 --> 01:53:19,935
Get on your knees!

1565
01:53:22,395 --> 01:53:24,636
Hands at the back!
Hands at the back!

1566
01:53:26,566 --> 01:53:27,874
Bapurao.

1567
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:30,447
Stay still or else I'll shoot.

1568
01:53:35,575 --> 01:53:37,020
Wretch.

1569
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,024
Leave it.

1570
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:45,588
Leave her.

1571
01:53:46,519 --> 01:53:48,362
You should've done something
when she kidnapped you.

1572
01:53:49,989 --> 01:53:51,696
What's the point of
showing your machismo now?

1573
01:53:51,758 --> 01:53:53,237
Sir, do you know
what happened that day?

1574
01:53:53,726 --> 01:53:54,864
Don't talk nonsense.

1575
01:53:55,228 --> 01:53:58,175
Nonsense? I am talking nonsense?

1576
01:53:58,398 --> 01:54:02,369
A college student and
a mad person abduct youâ€œ

1577
01:54:02,435 --> 01:54:05,177
...thrash you...and mess you up.

1578
01:54:05,238 --> 01:54:06,683
There's nothing you could do
and you're showing your anger now.

1579
01:54:06,773 --> 01:54:07,683
I see.

1580
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:09,252
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.

1581
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:11,980
Here.

1582
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:14,786
Manik.
- Sir.

1583
01:54:16,049 --> 01:54:17,050
Your FIR report.

1584
01:54:17,116 --> 01:54:20,120
Two mad people stole
tools from the mortuary.

1585
01:54:21,321 --> 01:54:23,699
And...they abducted Rajeshwar
and brought him here.

1586
01:54:23,923 --> 01:54:26,802
By the time we got
here to save Rajeshwar..

1587
01:54:27,827 --> 01:54:30,433
...they'd already severed his hand.

1588
01:54:31,331 --> 01:54:32,435
Bapurao.

1589
01:54:37,003 --> 01:54:39,005
And we had no other choice.

1590
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:43,286
So, in order to save Rajeshwar,
we had to kill these two.

1591
01:54:44,978 --> 01:54:46,889
Now shoot her in the forehead.

1592
01:54:47,113 --> 01:54:49,252
Manik...you'll do no such thing.

1593
01:54:50,717 --> 01:54:53,197
You cleverly slip
out of every situation.

1594
01:54:53,286 --> 01:54:54,492
You have a gun, don't you?

1595
01:54:55,154 --> 01:54:56,724
You shoot her! Shoot her!

1596
01:54:56,956 --> 01:54:58,492
Get your hands and limbs severed.

1597
01:54:59,092 --> 01:55:01,402
Why do you always ride
the gun on our shoulders?

1598
01:55:01,494 --> 01:55:04,907
Don't be crazy.. - You've been doing
crazy things from the beginning..

1599
01:55:04,998 --> 01:55:06,409
...and you're calling me crazy?

1600
01:55:07,834 --> 01:55:10,371
Don't you know how to
talk to your senior? - Hey!

1601
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:12,916
You're my senior only
when we're in the department.

1602
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:16,582
Out here, I am senior to you in age,
and you're my junior.

1603
01:55:17,277 --> 01:55:19,279
Bloody fool, talking nonsense.

1604
01:55:19,345 --> 01:55:21,382
Hey.. - Leave me!
- Be quiet...

1605
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:23,818
He'll create problems with the girls..

1606
01:55:23,883 --> 01:55:25,419
...and ask us to deal with it.

1607
01:55:25,818 --> 01:55:26,888
And sit at home by himself...

1608
01:55:26,953 --> 01:55:28,159
"I am in Nasik."

1609
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:29,562
"..in a meeting with the minister."

1610
01:55:36,195 --> 01:55:37,572
He talks too much.

1611
01:55:42,335 --> 01:55:44,212
Manik.
- Sir.

1612
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:45,613
Your new FIR report.

1613
01:55:47,173 --> 01:55:51,315
These two kidnapped Rajeshwar
and brought him here.

1614
01:55:52,512 --> 01:55:54,651
We followed them here.

1615
01:55:55,348 --> 01:55:57,851
We killed that mad person
and saved Rajeshwar.

1616
01:55:58,918 --> 01:56:00,090
Arrested this girl.

1617
01:56:01,487 --> 01:56:04,093
We were taking the girl..

1618
01:56:04,157 --> 01:56:08,003
â€œWhen she snatched
my gun and shot Rajeshwar.

1619
01:56:08,861 --> 01:56:12,138
Next...she tried to kill me.

1620
01:56:13,533 --> 01:56:14,568
That's when youâ€œ

1621
01:56:15,134 --> 01:56:17,808
Go back 10 feet from your position.

1622
01:56:18,338 --> 01:56:19,544
And shoot her.

1623
01:56:22,475 --> 01:56:23,920
Shoot her, Manik.

1624
01:56:25,845 --> 01:56:26,846
Back.

1625
01:56:27,013 --> 01:56:28,048
Shoot.

1626
01:56:32,885 --> 01:56:33,863
Manik.

1627
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:41,965
Hands up!

1628
01:56:45,965 --> 01:56:47,467
Manik, throw down your gun.

1629
01:56:47,567 --> 01:56:49,171
Here she comes again.

1630
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:51,881
Or else we'll have to shoot.

1631
01:56:52,372 --> 01:56:55,182
Rabiya, do you even know
what happened here?

1632
01:56:55,241 --> 01:56:56,379
Don't act without knowing the facts.

1633
01:56:56,442 --> 01:56:57,819
I know everything, sir.

1634
01:56:58,644 --> 01:57:00,419
Right from the accident
on Mumbai-Pune Highway..

1635
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:04,257
...to sending this girl
to the mental asylum, everything.

1636
01:57:05,051 --> 01:57:06,189
I know everything.

1637
01:57:06,652 --> 01:57:08,893
You can't kill her
and hide the truth anymore.

1638
01:57:09,255 --> 01:57:11,496
And even the commissioner
knows about it.

1639
01:57:12,692 --> 01:57:14,296
We've orders to arrest you, sir.

1640
01:57:19,198 --> 01:57:20,939
Please throw your guns down.

1641
01:57:22,602 --> 01:57:23,546
Manik.

1642
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:25,077
Throw your gun down.

1643
01:57:25,338 --> 01:57:26,544
Sir, please.

1644
01:57:31,677 --> 01:57:32,587
Amar.
- Ma'am.

1645
01:57:32,645 --> 01:57:33,589
Get their guns.

1646
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:42,127
They killed my friend.

1647
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:45,697
Her body is lying
somewhere at the back.

1648
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:48,229
Rafiq, go check.

1649
01:57:48,327 --> 01:57:49,465
Yes, ma'am.

1650
01:57:50,263 --> 01:57:53,244
Do you know everything?
- Yes, I do.

1651
01:57:54,534 --> 01:57:55,945
Ma's' I go now?

1652
01:58:00,106 --> 01:58:01,244
It's the commissioner?

1653
01:58:02,141 --> 01:58:04,121
Hello, sir.
- Where are you?

1654
01:58:04,644 --> 01:58:07,818
Behind Holy Cross College,
in the old church.

1655
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:10,322
What happened?
- We've arrested them, sir.

1656
01:58:11,184 --> 01:58:13,391
Don't arrest them, Rabiya.
There's a problem.

1657
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:15,255
Why, sir?

1658
01:58:16,289 --> 01:58:18,530
The guy they murdered on the highway..

1659
01:58:19,258 --> 01:58:23,070
...was the brother of North Indian
Party's top leader, Bablu Tiwari.

1660
01:58:23,496 --> 01:58:27,569
Remember...he was involved in
provoking riots in the city before.

1661
01:58:28,468 --> 01:58:30,812
This year his party
is claiming to host..

1662
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:32,975
...the biggest 'Chhat
Puja' event in Mumbai.

1663
01:58:33,673 --> 01:58:37,246
Due to which there is already growing
tension amongst the local parties.

1664
01:58:37,477 --> 01:58:39,684
That money was being
brought in for that event.

1665
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:44,493
If the news leaks out, that his
brother didn't die in an accident..

1666
01:58:44,851 --> 01:58:49,266
...but in fact, a few Mumbai police
officers murdered him for the money..

1667
01:58:49,522 --> 01:58:52,059
...then Bablu Tiwari
will provoke riots again.

1668
01:58:52,258 --> 01:58:54,397
And so I spoke with the Secretariat..

1669
01:58:54,494 --> 01:58:57,031
...and the higher authorities
and made this decision.

1670
01:58:58,064 --> 01:59:01,068
So end the case right
here and close the file.

1671
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:05,506
So please follow my orders.
Don't arrest them.

1672
01:59:06,906 --> 01:59:08,943
But sir, two murders
have been committed here.

1673
01:59:09,008 --> 01:59:12,080
Inspector Rajeshwar and
a mad person's been shot.

1674
01:59:12,178 --> 01:59:16,684
Look, Rabiya, they are going
to prepare a fake report anyway.

1675
01:59:16,883 --> 01:59:20,421
I promise a full inquiry
against Rane and his entire team.

1676
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,290
They will definitely
get a life sentence.

1677
01:59:22,355 --> 01:59:26,269
And that girl Akira.. - You're
thinking about saving one girl..

1678
01:59:26,325 --> 01:59:28,931
...and I am thinking about
thousands of innocent people.

1679
01:59:29,195 --> 01:59:30,503
Please understand.

1680
01:59:30,563 --> 01:59:32,941
This has now become a national issue.

1681
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:35,445
And so...we must keep
this under wraps..

1682
01:59:35,535 --> 01:59:37,412
...until the 'Chhat Puja'
isn't over next month.

1683
01:59:37,470 --> 01:59:39,450
But, sir,
the media's already standing outside.

1684
01:59:39,539 --> 01:59:41,416
I cannot lie to them.

1685
01:59:42,575 --> 01:59:45,920
Rabiya, give the phone to ACP Rane.

1686
01:59:46,012 --> 01:59:47,252
Yes, sir.

1687
01:59:54,253 --> 01:59:55,561
Commissioner sir.

1688
02:00:01,127 --> 02:00:02,162
Hello, sir.

1689
02:00:02,228 --> 02:00:05,368
ACP Rane, so you're above the law now?

1690
02:00:05,431 --> 02:00:07,069
You'll do as you want.
- No, sir, actually..

1691
02:00:07,166 --> 02:00:08,372
Do you have any idea..

1692
02:00:08,434 --> 02:00:11,210
...that your action has stirred
up a law and order situation.

1693
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:13,441
Now listen carefully.
- Yes, sir. Sure.

1694
02:00:13,506 --> 02:00:15,508
You've to pretend before the media..

1695
02:00:15,608 --> 02:00:17,952
...that Akira is an
escaped mental patient.

1696
02:00:18,244 --> 02:00:19,780
And don't mess it up.
- Okay, sir. We'll handle it.

1697
02:00:19,845 --> 02:00:20,323
Understand.

1698
02:00:20,413 --> 02:00:21,824
Yes, sir. Sure, sir.

1699
02:00:24,684 --> 02:00:28,063
Rabiya madam,
you can take your team and go back.

1700
02:00:29,855 --> 02:00:30,959
Manik.
- Sir.

1701
02:00:31,023 --> 02:00:34,561
Call the hospital, and call
an ambulance to take her back.

1702
02:00:35,127 --> 02:00:35,935
Sir.

1703
02:00:36,062 --> 02:00:37,439
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.

1704
02:00:37,563 --> 02:00:39,008
Make that girl sit in a corner.

1705
02:00:39,065 --> 02:00:40,203
Yes, sir.

1706
02:00:40,766 --> 02:00:41,870
What happened, madam?

1707
02:00:42,802 --> 02:00:44,304
I can come with you, right?

1708
02:00:44,403 --> 02:00:46,246
We cannot handle this
case anymore, Akira.

1709
02:00:46,472 --> 02:00:48,076
They've been asked to
take charge of this case now.

1710
02:00:48,608 --> 02:00:49,712
Them?

1711
02:00:49,809 --> 02:00:51,379
But they are responsible for all this.

1712
02:00:51,477 --> 02:00:52,649
How can they handle it?

1713
02:00:53,346 --> 02:00:55,189
Bapurao,
don't just sit there and stare.

1714
02:00:55,281 --> 02:00:57,557
Make her sit in a corner until
the ambulance doesn't arrive.

1715
02:00:57,617 --> 02:00:58,357
Sir.

1716
02:00:58,417 --> 02:01:00,055
Why should I go back to the hospital?

1717
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:04,062
Sorry, Akira,
but I can't help you right now.

1718
02:01:04,857 --> 02:01:07,133
But...what's the problem?

1719
02:01:07,493 --> 02:01:10,940
If your case gets registered,
it will turn into a communal issue.

1720
02:01:10,997 --> 02:01:12,977
And the riots can..

1721
02:01:13,032 --> 02:01:15,569
...lead to the loss
of many innocent lives.

1722
02:01:15,635 --> 02:01:18,013
Only you can save this
city from burning up again.

1723
02:01:18,604 --> 02:01:20,811
And so they are going to keep
you in the hospital for a while..

1724
02:01:20,873 --> 02:01:22,443
...and then let you go.

1725
02:01:22,508 --> 02:01:25,955
I am sorry, but...
there's no other choice, Akira.

1726
02:01:26,412 --> 02:01:28,221
How can you say that?

1727
02:01:29,415 --> 02:01:31,918
They tried to kill a girl.

1728
02:01:32,785 --> 02:01:35,197
Together they tried
to prove that I'm crazy.

1729
02:01:35,655 --> 02:01:37,032
Arrest them!

1730
02:01:38,024 --> 02:01:40,732
Will you send me back to the asylum
too in order to cover up the truth?

1731
02:01:41,661 --> 02:01:43,971
I am sorry, the department will
definitely give you compensationâ€œ

1732
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:46,203
...and I will try..
- Bapu Rao. - Compensation?

1733
02:01:46,499 --> 02:01:47,807
What do you mean by compensation?

1734
02:01:47,867 --> 02:01:48,470
Come on.

1735
02:01:48,567 --> 02:01:51,343
You mean first you
gouge both my eyes outâ€œ

1736
02:01:51,804 --> 02:01:53,943
...and then give me
an expensive walking-stick.

1737
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:55,483
Please cooperate with them.

1738
02:01:55,541 --> 02:01:57,145
Believe me, it can..

1739
02:01:58,577 --> 02:02:00,318
What's more that can happen?

1740
02:02:00,746 --> 02:02:02,487
You should've killed me instead.

1741
02:02:06,352 --> 02:02:09,993
'That day my hands were tied,
but not Akira's.'

1742
02:02:10,089 --> 02:02:12,160
Madam! Madam!

1743
02:02:12,224 --> 02:02:15,296
Madam! Madam!

1744
02:02:15,361 --> 02:02:17,932
Ma'am, their guns?
- Keep it.

1745
02:02:49,595 --> 02:02:50,573
Sir.

1746
02:02:50,863 --> 02:02:52,433
Let go.
- Let go.

1747
02:02:52,498 --> 02:02:54,842
Let go. Let go.

1748
02:02:55,301 --> 02:02:57,645
Let go. Let go.

1749
02:03:24,063 --> 02:03:24,598
Madam..

1750
02:03:24,663 --> 02:03:25,607
Please, madam.

1751
02:04:06,705 --> 02:04:10,118
'If your case gets registered,
it'll turn into a communal issue.'

1752
02:04:10,209 --> 02:04:12,246
'And the riots can..'

1753
02:04:12,311 --> 02:04:14,791
'..lead to the loss
of many innocent lives.'

1754
02:04:14,847 --> 02:04:17,327
'Only you can save this
city from burning up again.'

1755
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:38,674
Akira.

1756
02:06:19,838 --> 02:06:22,011
What...what's she saying?

1757
02:06:22,374 --> 02:06:26,823
She's saying that she
nailed herself to the cross.

1758
02:07:00,312 --> 02:07:04,727
'Since the report that deemed
Akira mentally ill, was fake..'

1759
02:07:05,017 --> 02:07:08,897
...I made sure that no case
was registered against her,'

1760
02:07:09,388 --> 02:07:13,234
'A few days later, she was
fully exonerated and she went home...'

1761
02:07:13,292 --> 02:07:16,603
'...where she began to follow
the path her father had shown her.'

1762
02:07:17,496 --> 02:07:22,343
'I want every daughter of this country,
including mine...to become like Akira.'

1763
02:07:22,801 --> 02:07:25,475
'Someone who learns to live
on the basis of her own strength.'

1764
02:07:27,272 --> 02:07:28,376
Very good.

1765
02:07:32,177 --> 02:07:36,648
"New paths are ahead.
New turns are ahead."

1766
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:40,522
"Don't be nervous."

1767
02:07:41,453 --> 02:07:46,232
"Keep on going alone
on your own strength."

1768
02:07:46,291 --> 02:07:50,865
"Determination is your companion."

1769
02:07:51,196 --> 02:07:58,080
"What do you care if darkness
is filled in the whole world."

1770
02:07:58,303 --> 02:08:05,016
"Why should your evenings
coax lamps for light."

1771
02:08:05,077 --> 02:08:09,423
"Your both eyes are filled with light."

1772
02:08:10,149 --> 02:08:14,757
"You are my star."

1773
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:18,458
"You are my star."

1774
02:08:19,058 --> 02:08:26,340
"You are my star filled with light."

1775
02:08:26,832 --> 02:08:31,178
"You are my star."

1776
02:08:49,722 --> 02:08:57,265
"The whole nature is reliant on you."

1777
02:08:59,264 --> 02:09:06,273
"You plant moon and stars."

1778
02:09:08,874 --> 02:09:12,947
"The sun burns through your heat."

1779
02:09:13,545 --> 02:09:18,460
"You are unaware of your miracles."

1780
02:09:18,717 --> 02:09:23,097
"You are the ground that
holds lakhs of skies.

1781
02:09:23,188 --> 02:09:30,834
"You are my star filled with light."

1782
02:09:30,896 --> 02:09:35,003
"You are my star."

1783
02:09:35,067 --> 02:09:42,679
"You are my star filled with light."

1784
02:09:42,775 --> 02:09:46,746
"You are my star."

1785
02:09:46,979 --> 02:09:54,522
"You are my star filled with light."

1786
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:58,793
"You are my star."

1787
02:09:58,891 --> 02:10:06,469
"You are my star filled with light."

1788
02:10:06,532 --> 02:10:10,708
"You are my star."

1789
02:10:10,769 --> 04:20:21,477
"Star."
