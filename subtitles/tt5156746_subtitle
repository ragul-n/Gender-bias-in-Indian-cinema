1
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:06,097
Yes.

2
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,730
<i>Harish Chaturverdi. Suraj Rawat.</i>

3
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,777
Arun Gupta.
The first three RAW Agents.

4
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:15,102
You know what to do.

5
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,444
Yes.

6
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:18,782
And the rest?

7
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,110
Soon.

8
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:54,497
They know that I am passing
information on to you.

9
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:56,398
They' ll be here to arrrest me soon.

10
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:59,470
So leave the country
as soon as you can.

11
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,327
Sir, these attacks are
not just on our agents...

12
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,989
...in fact, it's an attack on RAW

13
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:35,326
Sir, it's an attack
on the entire country.

14
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:38,535
Dubey, how many of our
agents are still active in China?

15
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:40,003
Sir, 20.

16
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:43,232
Ahh...now 17.

17
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:45,772
I am sure they will be attacked too.

18
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:49,414
Sir, if our agents
keep dying...

19
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,111
...then we'll know about
the Chinese army's movement...

20
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:56,211
...when they completely
get into Arunachal Pradesh.

21
00:08:56,277 --> 00:08:58,416
I know this is a matter
of National Security.

22
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:01,551
Whoever is doing this,
he's trying to weaken RAW.

23
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:03,458
But who could do such a thing,
and why?

24
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:05,622
Only he can answer this question,
but find him.

25
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,666
How will we catch him, sir?

26
00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:17,066
I am getting you 5 acres
of land in the hean of Mumbai.

27
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,471
You can easily make 1000-1500 flats.

28
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,706
That's fine, but what about Manohar?

29
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:24,108
I will deal with Manohar.

30
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:33,184
Inspector Yashwardhan.

31
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:38,060
Did you come here to buy a flat?

32
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:41,756
No...I've come for you.

33
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:45,701
You've a court hearing today.
Did you forget?

34
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:47,604
Are you crazy?

35
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:52,339
You think you can drag me out of
my area, in front of my men.

36
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:53,611
Huh!

37
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,476
And without the uniform.

38
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,706
You think I would've spared
you if I was in uniform?

39
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:01,015
We'll come later.
- No-no.

40
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:04,518
Go deal with him.

41
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:09,083
Wait.

42
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:19,765
My wife died 5 years ago.

43
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:23,072
Since then I've lost my mind.

44
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:26,768
I tried really hard to die,
but no one could kill me.

45
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:29,738
But maybe today is my lucky day.

46
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,715
There's 10-12 of you...

47
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:33,310
...and I am all alone.

48
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:36,310
Maybe you can kill me.

49
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:57,273
I forgot to tell you one thing.

50
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:04,646
I will diembut I will
take couple of you with me.

51
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:08,718
Especially you!

52
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,040
Anyone else?

53
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,233
Where are you going?

54
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,280
Wait...don't be scared.

55
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:38,142
Gotyamkill him!

56
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:39,707
Shoot him, Gotya! Kill him!

57
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:40,513
Kill him!

58
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,417
You're dead now!
You're a dead-man.

59
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,594
Wait. . .wait...

60
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:56,800
Wait...
- Start the car... - Let's go.

61
00:11:58,258 --> 00:11:59,328
Curse you...

62
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:00,565
Come on, start the car.

63
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:02,539
Do something.
Start the car.

64
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,700
Let's go. Let's go.

65
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:05,609
What are you doing?

66
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,373
Come on, do something.

67
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:15,345
What's this?
- Oh my, God.

68
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:17,620
Drive...

69
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:21,049
What are you doing?

70
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:27,630
Spare me...let go of the car.

71
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,138
Let go.

72
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:37,573
Let go of the car.

73
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:50,513
Shall we?

74
00:12:56,283 --> 00:12:57,660
Sir, what are your comments...

75
00:12:57,718 --> 00:12:59,220
...on the people that
died in China.

76
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:01,993
Look...our Intelligence
has found out that...

77
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:05,229
...the people who died in China
were involved in criminal activities.

78
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:08,004
And they died due
to a internal gang-war.

79
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:11,338
But they were RAW agents, sir.
- RAW agents?

80
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:13,509
They were not even Indian citizens.

81
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,709
The media is sensationalizing
this news for no reason.

82
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,477
Sir...sir...sir...
- No questions, please.

83
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,019
The government clearly states that...

84
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:23,076
...lndia has no connection
with these incidents.

85
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:25,453
The people killed in Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou...

86
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,492
...were not Indian citizens at all.

87
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:31,121
China has maintained
silence on these incidents.

88
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,792
So commenting on these
incidents right now will be...

89
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,594
Is it done?

90
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:42,799
Yes, it's done.

91
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,702
ACP sir, how long will this continue?

92
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:50,441
As long as people like
Niranjan are running free.

93
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:52,776
Which means forever.

94
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:57,488
I am a policeman,
if I don't do something then who will?

95
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:00,252
Why? Aren't there other policemen?

96
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,688
Did you take the responsibility of...

97
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:04,524
...bringing all criminals to justice?
- Maya.

98
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:06,155
Hmmm...

99
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:22,446
"One day this heart
will stop beating."

100
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,778
"Be with me...until then."

101
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:32,782
"No matter how long this night is."

102
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:38,421
"No matter how long this night is."

103
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:43,432
"They will be yours forever..."

104
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:48,505
"...just give an indication."

105
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:53,701
"Where can I go without you?"

106
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:58,773
"Try to understand."

107
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:04,245
"I will tightly embrace your shadow"

108
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:09,590
"...just give an indication..."

109
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,695
Mr. Yashwardhan Singh,
courier for you!

110
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:22,568
Pen. - Huh?

111
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:58,802
<i>The question is whether
Harish Chaturvedi, Suva} Rawat...</i>

112
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:01,979
...and Arun Gupta died in an accident.

113
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:03,708
Or is there a mystery behind it?

114
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:06,178
The CBI is still
investigating this case...

115
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:10,153
...and we hope to learn
more about it soon.

116
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:18,354
'Harish...'

117
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,062
'Harish...'

118
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:21,760
'Get up you drunkard.'

119
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:23,598
'Come on.'

120
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:28,762
'Have we arrived?
- We will if we start moving.'

121
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:38,007
'We've been sitting
here for 30 minutes. - Why?'

122
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:42,417
'I won't drive.
- Why?'

123
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:49,085
'Because...no drink and driving.'

124
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:57,033
'And even if I do,
you will arrest me, you cop.'

125
00:16:58,558 --> 00:16:59,536
'COP--'

126
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:03,065
'And what are you? Spy?

127
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:07,673
'SPY... Mr. Bond.
- Correct.'

128
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:11,744
'So tell me Mr.
Bond, where are you being posted?

129
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,283
'Tell me...what if you die?'

130
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:24,386
'The way you beat up the bad guys.'

131
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,759
'lam sure you will
end up dead first.'

132
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:29,261
Hey...

133
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:34,335
'I am a cop...if I die,
I will be called a martyr.'

134
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:37,030
'If anything happens to you...'

135
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,039
'...then the government will say that
he wasn't an Indian citizen at all.'

136
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,043
'That is right.'

137
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,146
'Then you tell them.'

138
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:55,658
'You tell everyone that
I am India's best citizen.'

139
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,521
'I was the best Indian citizen.'

140
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,217
Sir, none of them
was an accident case.

141
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:58,648
The Chinese agency learned
that they were RAW agents...

142
00:18:58,712 --> 00:18:59,782
...and they were killed.

143
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:02,322
Someone is definitely
leaking our identity.

144
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,690
But how can a police
officer have this information?

145
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,723
Yash is not some ordinary officer.

146
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:10,696
Call him.

147
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:17,700
Send him in.

148
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,672
Excuse me...you've been called in.

149
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:30,052
Yash, this is Anjan Das.
Head of RAW.

150
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,286
Please share whatever
information you have with him.

151
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:38,986
Harish sent this book to me, not him.

152
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:42,395
Do you know what this means?

153
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,701
Harish didn't trust RAW.

154
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:46,101
How dare you say that?

155
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,334
Harish was one of my best officers.
- He was my best friend.

156
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,534
But that doesn't...

157
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:59,105
There are two persons in
this room whom I trust the most.

158
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:01,285
Please find a way to work together.

159
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:04,553
Yash.

160
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:17,793
Harish has written
'2012' in the year 2016.

161
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:20,671
It's not a mistake, it's a clue.

162
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:27,773
It's not a date...

163
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:31,409
It's a page number.

164
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:38,044
Page B, 8 and 12.

165
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:43,220
The first alphabet of page <i>6</i> is 'S'.

166
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,063
On page 8 is 'P'.

167
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:48,360
And on page 12 is..
- 'Y'.

168
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:52,396
And that makes it 'SPY'.
What's the big deal about it?

169
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:55,832
We all know there's someone
amongst us who is a spy for China.

170
00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:57,799
Do you know where he is?

171
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:00,710
No.

172
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,204
Harish knew.

173
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:10,555
'Enjoy My Book.'

174
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:13,451
EMB.
- Embassy.

175
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:29,667
<i>Embassy Budapest.</i>

176
00:21:30,263 --> 00:21:31,207
This is bad news, sir.

177
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,039
It takes years to make a spy-ring.

178
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,403
We must find that man.

179
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:36,469
Sir, I will find that man.
Let me go to Budapest.

180
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:38,812
You shouldn't take such complicated
matters personally, Yash.

181
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:41,579
I am taking this personally...
so I won't turn over.

182
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:46,086
It is clear that one of your
men is leaking this information.

183
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,361
But please understand, we cannot carry
out such missions on foreign soil.

184
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:54,192
There are protocols.

185
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:57,792
Times have changed.
and so has the country.

186
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,232
Now we strike right at the heart.

187
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:01,663
Without protocols.

188
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:03,604
But you're not a RAW officer.

189
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:06,107
And you're not trained
for such missions.

190
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,146
What about those who were?
Are they alive?

191
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:13,711
Anjan, trust me.

192
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:17,478
You won't regret the
decision of sending him there.

193
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:27,162
Look Yash, you will go there
with the Eastern Europe in-charge KK.

194
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,229
She's created quite a
network in the last two years.

195
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:31,599
Sir. I need your signatures on this.

196
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:34,662
Yash, go meet KK. I will join you.

197
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:47,080
Did you counter-check the
information which Martinez sent?

198
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,118
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:50,712
Where can I find KK?

200
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,558
Send me printouts of these, please.
- Okay, ma'am.

201
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,625
I am KK...Kamaljeet Kaur.
- Ohh.

202
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,528
What was that 'ohh'?

203
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:11,370
Were you expecting
a male officer? - Yes.

204
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,772
So you don't think girls are capable?

205
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:17,640
All I know is that
KK can be a name of a guy.

206
00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:19,476
By the way, who are you?
- Guys!

207
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:21,312
Conference room, now.

208
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,050
We've a lead on the China case.

209
00:23:28,415 --> 00:23:31,225
Someone's leaking the identities of
our agents from the Budapest Embassy.

210
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,594
We've to find him,
and bring him back alive.

211
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,600
Yash is a police officer.
You two will go together.

212
00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:38,100
Sir, I have a question.

213
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:40,330
I should be accompanied
by a trained RAW agent.

214
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,267
Why this police officer?
- Because the lead came through him.

215
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,043
This is Brijesh Verma.
Our HRD Minister.

216
00:23:51,704 --> 00:23:55,516
He began his career
in 1988...as an IS officer.

217
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:56,811
Sikkim cadre.

218
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:58,783
He became the cabinet
secretary in 2012.

219
00:23:59,245 --> 00:24:00,246
He remained in this post for 2 years.

220
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,293
And entered politics in 2014.

221
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:04,019
He contested the elections
from Meerut and became an MP.

222
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,460
And a year later the HRD minister.

223
00:24:05,518 --> 00:24:07,725
Sir, this is irrelevant information.
We're wasting our time.

224
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:10,728
It's essential for you
to know about the HRD Minister.

225
00:24:11,124 --> 00:24:13,297
Because he's going to Budapest
for the lndo-Hungarian summit.

226
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,737
You two will go there pretending to
look after his security preparations.

227
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:17,234
It's a perfect cover.

228
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:20,568
That's the RAW's way of doing things.

229
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:24,080
Diligence. Homework. Preparation.

230
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:26,511
This is Naren Kaushik.

231
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:27,777
Our ambassador for Hungary.

232
00:24:28,174 --> 00:24:29,676
He will assist you with
any kind of help you need.

233
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:31,521
You can trust him completely.

234
00:24:32,111 --> 00:24:34,387
All the details of the Budapest
Embassy staff are in here.

235
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,591
<i>And simcards too.</i>

236
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:38,262
I am going to Berlin 3 days
later for a security conference.

237
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:40,662
If needed, I'll come to Budapest.

238
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,429
Sir, who is leading this team?
- Of course, you will.

239
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,407
Some champagne for you, ma'am.

240
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:56,208
Thank you.

241
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:23,466
What is RAW's yearly turnover? - What?

242
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:26,473
No...they take good
care of their employees.

243
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:30,504
I bought the business
class ticket myself.

244
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,280
Then you must have booked
a suite for yourself in the hotel.

245
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:38,645
With your money.

246
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:41,624
Only film-stars live in hotels.

247
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:43,321
We're going to the safe house.

248
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:10,485
This place is called
a safe-house for a reason.

249
00:26:10,677 --> 00:26:12,452
Because no one knows we're here.

250
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,219
Anyway, the ambassador
will be here in 10-15 minutes...

251
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:18,159
...we need to discuss further plans.

252
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:20,193
How did you get the
address to this place?

253
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:23,392
The ambassador emailed it to me.

254
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,491
Anything else.

255
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:30,233
Yash, what are you doing?

256
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:49,621
Have you lost your mind, Yash?

257
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:51,161
What the hell is wrong with you?

258
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,629
Don't you dare touch me again!

259
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:53,561
This is not the way...

260
00:27:18,544 --> 00:27:21,081
Your job is done. They are dead.

261
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:35,166
You knew this place
was rigged with a bomb?

262
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,304
If he can hack the agency's system...

263
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:42,506
...and get the agents names, then he
can read the Ambassador's mails too.

264
00:27:44,637 --> 00:27:47,277
That's the Mumbai Police's
way of doing this.

265
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:52,254
Gut feel. Aggression. Common Sense.

266
00:27:54,347 --> 00:27:56,588
Where do we go novfl
- Same place where film-stars stay.

267
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:08,604
Sir, KK here.

268
00:28:09,128 --> 00:28:13,406
Thank God you're alive. - Yes,
but whoever it was, thinks we're dead.

269
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,544
Let's keep it that way.
- I'll take care of that.

270
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:21,548
It is with deep sorrow
that I announce the loss of...

271
00:28:21,607 --> 00:28:23,518
...two of our officers in the blast.

272
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,223
They were here in Budapest
for the lndo-Hungarian Summit.

273
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,118
And their bodies
are yet to be recovered.

274
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:33,758
We deeply mourn their loss.

275
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,264
But the Summit will
commence as scheduled.

276
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:42,205
And we're positive, that with the
help of the Hungarian authorities...

277
00:28:43,162 --> 00:28:46,769
...whoever is responsible
for this crime, will be punished.

278
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:52,082
I am going to check the footage
and records of all the employees...

279
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:53,708
...and zero-in on the suspects.

280
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:56,710
After that we'll keep surveillance
on him, and find him.

281
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,647
Brilliant. All the best.

282
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,017
Where are you going?

283
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:07,093
You work your way,
and I'll work my way.

284
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:04,749
These drinks are
from the gentleman there.

285
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:07,684
Thank you so much.

286
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:09,784
Yash. - Lina.

287
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:53,600
Coffee?

288
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:05,414
I don't drink coffee. - Thank God.

289
00:31:10,543 --> 00:31:12,352
I've prepared a list of suspects.

290
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,622
And zeroed-down on these three.

291
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:26,797
You're drunk.

292
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,767
We're here to work not go pub-hopping.

293
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:31,099
He's your man.

294
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,767
Shiv Sharma, the interpreter.

295
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:37,705
Not possible.

296
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,216
He's got a disciplined routine,
used to work in Belgium.

297
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,445
Never missed office.

298
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:44,213
Always punctual...and
makes good money too.

299
00:31:44,644 --> 00:31:46,282
No connection with the Chinese.

300
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:48,052
No alcohol or cigarettes either.

301
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:50,249
No girlfriends...from
home to office and back home.

302
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:53,558
He's clean.
- Exactly...he's too clean.

303
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:56,629
These are my three suspects.

304
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,300
Suspect no. 1. Vikas Gupta.

305
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:04,573
There's been a considerable change...

306
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,337
...in his behavior
in the last 2.5 months.

307
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,504
For someone who never
worked over-time...

308
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:12,375
...what made him so hard-working
that he works over-time every day?

309
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:15,584
No. 2 Anshuman Saha.

310
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,481
He married this girl 3 months ago.

311
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:21,147
She's a resident of Hong Kong.

312
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:24,154
They never met before...or
even go on a date.

313
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:25,627
So why suddenly this wedding?

314
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:28,256
No. 3... Amit Singh.

315
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:31,030
I suspect him the most.

316
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,537
Before Budapest, he worked for 3
years at the Indian Embassy in China.

317
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:36,435
And here he handles the Chinese desk.

318
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:38,470
So here's the plan.

319
00:32:39,031 --> 00:32:42,774
Like you said...he hacked
our entire system from Budapest.

320
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,408
We'll send a coded email
to the Ambassador from a fake ID...

321
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:49,419
...stating that a Chinese embassy
official has agreed to be our agent.

322
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:51,751
And he's coming to meet
us at the Glasshouse An Gallery.

323
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:55,691
And whoever our guy is,
he will definitely decode our email.

324
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,760
And if our suspicion is true...

325
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,194
...he will show up.

326
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:02,425
You are right.

327
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:04,563
It's a perfect plan.

328
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,265
He will definitely come there.

329
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,181
What do we have?

330
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:38,387
Not much, boss. We have camera's
in every corner of the gallery.

331
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:49,137
Anytime now.

332
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:03,412
Thank you.

333
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:14,494
That's him. That's Amit Singh.

334
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:15,657
Let me zoom in for you.

335
00:35:17,756 --> 00:35:18,496
I knew it.

336
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:20,264
I told you Yash, he will come.

337
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:23,735
Ma'am, he's making a call.

338
00:35:25,264 --> 00:35:27,266
Do you want me to intercept?
- Hold on.

339
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,073
He's not making a call,
he's taking pictures.

340
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:35,649
This is our guy,
we have to pick him up.

341
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,550
Yash, l...

342
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,454
Yash! Yash!

343
00:35:58,063 --> 00:36:00,475
Excuse me.
What the hell is this? Who are you?

344
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,343
Only I will ask questions.
Come with me.

345
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:05,378
But...what have I done?

346
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,646
Where are you taking me? - Check this.

347
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:08,548
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:13,019
That's my personal phone,
you cannot use it. - Shut up.

349
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:15,121
Yash, where are you?
- KK, your plan was right...

350
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:16,216
...but you got the wrong man.

351
00:36:16,582 --> 00:36:17,526
Let Amit go.

352
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,153
What? Why?

353
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,721
The right guy never went
inside the gallery. - Who?

354
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:22,758
Shiv Sharma.

355
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:24,558
Oh come on, Yash. Not again.

356
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:26,102
You're wasting your time.

357
00:36:26,258 --> 00:36:27,703
I've already arrested Amit.

358
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:31,298
Check the CCTV image once.
I am going to Shiv's home.

359
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:33,468
Yash.

360
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:43,714
What were you doing
in the gallery? - l...

361
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,291
Someone forwarded me a email
which was sent to the Ambassador.

362
00:36:47,346 --> 00:36:49,758
And it was written...
- Someone forwarded you the mail?

363
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:51,119
Yes!

364
00:36:56,555 --> 00:36:57,556
Take him to the embassy.

365
00:36:57,623 --> 00:37:00,103
You, show me the CCTV footage.
- Yes, ma'am.

366
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:12,171
Go back.

367
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,383
More.

368
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:16,746
Stop.

369
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:19,345
Zoom into that.

370
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:27,353
'This is your man.'

371
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:31,761
'Shiv Sharma.'

372
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:33,559
Sh",

373
00:42:09,635 --> 00:42:13,276
Hello. - Yash,
you were right about Shiv.

374
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,717
Where are you?

375
00:42:14,773 --> 00:42:16,184
Behind his building.

376
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:19,318
I am right outside his door.
- He's not inside.

377
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:24,321
But there is someone inside.

378
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:43,612
Freeze!

379
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:53,255
It's you.

380
00:42:53,812 --> 00:42:55,348
I was scared for a moment.

381
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:14,242
Sh",

382
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,477
KK! KK!

383
00:43:25,711 --> 00:43:27,418
What happened? Where did he go?

384
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,056
I don't know.

385
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:30,216
Well, he didn't come downstairs.

386
00:43:30,282 --> 00:43:31,283
That means...

387
00:47:13,572 --> 00:47:15,176
You've an opportunity again today.

388
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:18,277
Can you shoot?

389
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,126
I will definitely shoot.

390
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:26,654
Would you like to see?

391
00:48:04,723 --> 00:48:08,637
You're hiding something from me.
- Excuse me.

392
00:48:09,628 --> 00:48:11,005
What do you want to say?

393
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:14,103
Why do I feel that Shiv knows you?

394
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:16,345
Of course, he's my fiancé after all.

395
00:48:17,302 --> 00:48:20,146
Why did he say that you can't shoot?

396
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,753
That's none of your business. - It is.

397
00:48:29,347 --> 00:48:32,226
It's hard to believe that
this guy can do something like this.

398
00:48:32,317 --> 00:48:34,388
Where did you recruit him from?

399
00:48:34,653 --> 00:48:38,533
We placed an ad...for a consultant.

400
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,730
He had all the necessary
qualifications.

401
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,138
He's from Belgium.

402
00:48:43,194 --> 00:48:45,697
He can speak Hungarian and French.

403
00:48:46,431 --> 00:48:50,140
Did you notice anything suspicious
about him? - Not at all.

404
00:48:50,735 --> 00:48:54,080
He's hard working...and
good at what he does.

405
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:58,277
He used to mind his own business.
I thought it was a big plus.

406
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,318
So he has no family. - No one.

407
00:49:01,947 --> 00:49:02,721
He's an orphan.

408
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,291
He was only 3 years old
when his parents passed away.

409
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,429
He grew up in some
orphanage in Faridabad.

410
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:12,457
Later he went to America
on scholarship...for higher studies.

411
00:49:12,524 --> 00:49:15,403
Anyway...we've spoken
to the Hungarian authorities.

412
00:49:15,727 --> 00:49:17,263
The paperwork's complete too.

413
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:20,638
You can take him to India tonight.

414
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:24,408
Postpone our travel details,
I want to interrogate him.

415
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:27,075
No, our orders are we must
immediately take him to India.

416
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,511
He'll be interrogated there.

417
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:31,349
If we interrogate him now,
we might save someone's life.

418
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:33,389
I am sorry, Yashmorders are orders.

419
00:49:33,445 --> 00:49:35,186
You follow orders, I am going inside.

420
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,327
You're forgetting
who is leading the team.

421
00:49:39,384 --> 00:49:41,057
Look, I know Harish was your friend.

422
00:49:41,286 --> 00:49:44,165
But the other agents
had friends and family too.

423
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:46,093
This is not a personal fight.

424
00:49:46,524 --> 00:49:48,629
Yash. She's right.

425
00:49:56,434 --> 00:49:59,711
No chip, no mike, no transmitter.
We found nothing.

426
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:01,512
We found this when
we checked his clothes...

427
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:02,745
...but there's nothing in here either.

428
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:07,518
If you're done ogling at me,
can we get to my clothes?

429
00:50:11,683 --> 00:50:16,655
No-no-no. . .these boring, uncool...

430
00:50:17,756 --> 00:50:21,533
mover-sized clothes
cannot be your choice Ms. Kaur.

431
00:50:24,596 --> 00:50:29,375
But yes, often cops
have a bad taste in clothes.

432
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:31,811
Don't talk about cops

433
00:50:32,137 --> 00:50:32,808
Why?

434
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:34,575
Why?

435
00:50:35,573 --> 00:50:36,517
Why?

436
00:50:37,475 --> 00:50:38,419
Oh..

437
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:41,418
Because I am a traitor, right?

438
00:50:44,516 --> 00:50:48,191
Don't argue with
me on patriotism and traitor.

439
00:50:50,221 --> 00:50:51,325
You will lose.

440
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:55,201
Are you done? Shall we?

441
00:50:55,693 --> 00:50:57,070
Wear your clothes.

442
00:50:57,462 --> 00:51:00,068
Or else I will drag
you to India like this.

443
00:51:34,732 --> 00:51:35,733
Yes, sir.

444
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,503
We've left the embassy.

445
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:39,708
It will take us almost
an hour to get to the airport.

446
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,211
One hour...

447
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:48,680
This will be the longest
hour of your life.

448
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,592
We won't get to the airport. Ask why?

449
00:51:53,685 --> 00:51:54,720
Ask.

450
00:51:57,222 --> 00:51:58,724
Because there is problem in our team.

451
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,460
What a peculiar team.

452
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:03,165
A rich brat RAW agent who can't shoot.

453
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:07,673
And a Police Officer
who couldn't save his wife.

454
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:10,171
How will they save their agents?

455
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,441
You better be careful, Ms. Kaur.

456
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:19,713
Ms. Kaur...anyone who has any kind
of relation with him ends up dead.

457
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:21,647
Take poor Harish for instance.

458
00:52:23,781 --> 00:52:26,591
Don't react, Yash.
That's what he wants.

459
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,790
And as far as relations
are concerned...

460
00:52:31,055 --> 00:52:33,160
...Ms. Kaur's relations
were always in a mess.

461
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,733
You know when she was 18...

462
00:52:36,794 --> 00:52:39,604
...her dad was going around
with an 18 year old girl.

463
00:52:39,664 --> 00:52:40,699
Like this.

464
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:43,442
She was 18, and so was that girl.

465
00:52:43,735 --> 00:52:45,339
How would Ms Kaur feel?

466
00:52:47,472 --> 00:52:49,281
Poor thing...

467
00:52:52,076 --> 00:52:54,579
Sir...sir, please handle her.

468
00:52:54,646 --> 00:52:57,286
Sir... handle her.

469
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,151
I hate violence.

470
00:53:00,418 --> 00:53:02,694
By the way, that reminds me
two more of your men are going to die.

471
00:53:02,754 --> 00:53:05,598
Shut up, another word...and
you'll regret it.

472
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:20,513
If you hadn't shut me up,
he could've been saved.

473
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,744
This one's on you, ma'am.

474
00:53:28,112 --> 00:53:29,216
KK, there are two bikes.

475
00:53:45,196 --> 00:53:46,470
What are you doing, sir?

476
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:49,102
One's dead,
can you save the other one?

477
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,210
Talk!

478
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,511
Unbelievable sir,
one says shut up and other says talk.

479
00:53:54,572 --> 00:53:56,415
I'm telling you this team isn't right.

480
00:53:57,775 --> 00:54:00,517
Tell me, Where the next
agent is going to be killed.

481
00:54:02,046 --> 00:54:02,615
Talk.

482
00:54:03,548 --> 00:54:04,754
Yash, pull him inside now.

483
00:54:06,017 --> 00:54:08,657
Talk.
- Okay. Okay.

484
00:54:12,156 --> 00:54:13,226
30 minutes.

485
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,737
He will die in 30 minutes,
and only you can save him.

486
00:54:15,994 --> 00:54:16,734
30 minutes...

487
00:54:16,995 --> 00:54:20,636
So he's somewhere in Budapest.
- That's good...that's good.

488
00:54:20,698 --> 00:54:22,006
<i>Not had, Ms Kama.</i>

489
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:25,343
So what if Ms Kaur can't shoot,
at least she can use her brain.

490
00:54:33,244 --> 00:54:34,416
Now use your brain on this.

491
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:37,722
One angel...four paths.
How will you save your friend?

492
00:56:16,547 --> 00:56:19,357
Take it inside that building, we'll
have to wait here for a while.

493
00:56:49,213 --> 00:56:50,487
KK, there.

494
00:56:58,489 --> 00:56:59,467
Who are you?

495
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:02,068
We need your help.

496
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,097
What do you want?
- We need a place to hide.

497
00:57:09,066 --> 00:57:09,737
Okay.

498
00:57:16,574 --> 00:57:20,181
Yash. - I've no time for 20 questions.

499
00:57:20,244 --> 00:57:22,485
Tell me where are they
going to kill the other agent.

500
00:57:22,713 --> 00:57:24,021
Tell me. -Yash.

501
00:57:24,081 --> 00:57:26,391
They are already scared. Don't!

502
00:58:01,986 --> 00:58:02,555
Hey...

503
00:58:03,321 --> 00:58:04,095
Hey...

504
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:07,963
Can you play? Come here.

505
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,532
One angel...four paths!

506
00:58:24,008 --> 00:58:25,043
Yash!

507
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,625
One angel...four paths! This is it!

508
00:58:37,755 --> 00:58:38,733
Heroes Square.

509
00:58:49,367 --> 00:58:51,244
We still have 10 minutes.

510
00:59:58,336 --> 01:00:00,646
We've only 10 minutes to save
the next agent, yash.

511
01:00:00,705 --> 01:00:02,184
We have to move fast.

512
01:00:07,244 --> 01:00:08,416
Hurry up. Yash!

513
01:00:11,515 --> 01:00:13,017
We don't have much time.

514
01:00:14,552 --> 01:00:16,793
Tick-tock...tick-tock.

515
01:00:20,591 --> 01:00:22,332
There! That's Heroes Square.

516
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,440
There's no one here.

517
01:00:26,564 --> 01:00:28,202
Where is he, goddammit.

518
01:00:31,068 --> 01:00:32,206
Where is he?

519
01:00:33,304 --> 01:00:34,476
You're at the right place.

520
01:00:35,106 --> 01:00:38,713
But unfortunately
you're 20 foot above.

521
01:00:39,143 --> 01:00:41,817
Heroes Square is also a metro station.

522
01:01:38,636 --> 01:01:39,637
He's dead.

523
01:01:44,241 --> 01:01:45,811
Poor guy, he was a nice man.

524
01:01:46,377 --> 01:01:50,621
He use to flirt a bit,
but at the end he was a man.

525
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:55,195
I am very sorry for your loss. - Yash!

526
01:01:55,786 --> 01:01:56,594
Yash, what are you doing?

527
01:01:56,654 --> 01:01:58,634
Yash, what are you doing?
We want him alive.

528
01:01:58,689 --> 01:02:00,760
We wanted our man alive, not him!

529
01:02:01,525 --> 01:02:02,503
Why?

530
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,563
Our men...our country.

531
01:02:06,297 --> 01:02:07,275
Money?

532
01:02:07,565 --> 01:02:10,273
How much money is enough
to let our own men die?

533
01:02:11,068 --> 01:02:13,674
You think I am doing this for money.

534
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,645
I am really disappointed in you, sir.

535
01:02:18,075 --> 01:02:19,452
Then why are you doing this?

536
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:20,614
What do you want?

537
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:25,288
You two can't give me what I want.

538
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:26,589
He's wasting our time.

539
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:29,324
We already missed our flight once,
we cannot miss another one.

540
01:02:49,473 --> 01:02:52,420
Must be really hard
to tolerate failure, right.

541
01:02:53,744 --> 01:02:55,587
By now you two must be habitual"

542
01:02:56,413 --> 01:02:57,391
...of failing.

543
01:02:59,784 --> 01:03:02,230
Two losers are here to get a winner.

544
01:03:04,455 --> 01:03:07,436
The RAW should have
sent someone more capable.

545
01:03:14,265 --> 01:03:17,371
See...here comes the cavalry.

546
01:03:21,739 --> 01:03:22,649
Yash.

547
01:03:23,107 --> 01:03:25,144
First the apartmentmand now here.

548
01:03:25,543 --> 01:03:27,716
How do they know where we are?

549
01:03:28,646 --> 01:03:30,455
What? Don't look at me.

550
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:32,158
You have my phone.

551
01:03:32,316 --> 01:03:34,523
And you guys already checked
all the holes in my body.

552
01:03:37,588 --> 01:03:39,158
How will I tell anyone?

553
01:03:39,623 --> 01:03:41,534
I doubt it's one of you.

554
01:03:42,593 --> 01:03:44,163
Someone's dirty!

555
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,755
Where are you going, Yash?
The tunnel is closed. - I know.

556
01:06:10,474 --> 01:06:11,976
Kudos to you two...

557
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,656
I mean that was
good...it was impressive.

558
01:06:15,746 --> 01:06:18,249
But even I will give you two a
chance to be impressed by me.

559
01:06:18,582 --> 01:06:19,617
At the airport.

560
01:06:20,684 --> 01:06:24,723
I mean...there were
so many men on the way...

561
01:06:25,222 --> 01:06:27,031
...so I am sure the entire
army's waiting at the airport.

562
01:06:28,058 --> 01:06:29,537
Who says we're going to the airport?

563
01:07:24,348 --> 01:07:27,386
Where are you taking me? - India.

564
01:07:33,023 --> 01:07:35,560
This helicopter will land
directly on the airport's tarmac.

565
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:37,529
Yash, bad news.

566
01:08:38,422 --> 01:08:40,527
Another agent of ours
was killed in Malaysia.

567
01:08:41,425 --> 01:08:43,268
Bring Shiv to India
as soon as you can.

568
01:08:44,628 --> 01:08:46,039
Yash.

569
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,538
Hello, yash.

570
01:09:15,659 --> 01:09:16,729
<i>This is had, '(ash.</i>

571
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,400
Now we'll never know...

572
01:09:18,462 --> 01:09:20,601
...how many more names
did he give to the Chinese.

573
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:24,669
Someone was definitely
telling them about our location.

574
01:09:25,135 --> 01:09:26,170
How else did they
know we're coming here...

575
01:09:26,236 --> 01:09:28,113
...and not going to the airport.

576
01:09:28,172 --> 01:09:29,344
But who?

577
01:09:36,146 --> 01:09:37,284
<i>Somethings wrong.</i>

578
01:09:37,648 --> 01:09:40,561
We're missing something.
- You're thinking too hard, Yash.

579
01:09:40,717 --> 01:09:43,664
It's over, he's dead. - Exactly.

580
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,633
They tried to save him all day.

581
01:09:47,257 --> 01:09:49,669
So why suddenly kill him?
- It's simple.

582
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:51,299
When they realized
they cannot stop Shiv...

583
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:54,069
...from being taken to India,
they killed him.

584
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:56,036
Why didn't they kill us?

585
01:09:57,534 --> 01:09:59,172
That sniper had a clear shot.

586
01:10:01,205 --> 01:10:04,345
Did you check his bullet wound?
- No, why?

587
01:10:08,478 --> 01:10:09,513
Sir.

588
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:18,624
You're good, sir.
But I am just a little better.

589
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:24,497
Sir, this nature is just amazing.

590
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,264
Have you heard about
the Medusa Spider?

591
01:10:27,798 --> 01:10:29,368
I didn't either.

592
01:10:29,766 --> 01:10:31,370
The venom of this spider...

593
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:35,542
...can stop a man's
heartbeat for 30 minutes.

594
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,464
Good move.

595
01:10:51,822 --> 01:10:56,430
But next time...your
heartbeat will stop for good.

596
01:10:57,561 --> 01:11:00,064
I mean you're such a player.

597
01:11:00,163 --> 01:11:01,642
You've a dialogue
even for your defeat.

598
01:11:01,698 --> 01:11:03,405
How is Ms. Kaur?

599
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,374
She must be upset.

600
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:08,616
Take care of her.
- You think about yourself.

601
01:11:09,506 --> 01:11:11,508
How long do you think
they can save you?

602
01:11:11,575 --> 01:11:13,213
I salute you, sir.

603
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,717
I mean...you won't give up.

604
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,150
Now this game is going to be fun.

605
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,587
Killing six people is a game for you?

606
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,460
I didn't start this game, sir.

607
01:11:23,253 --> 01:11:24,789
But I will definitely finish it.

608
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:29,194
By the way, don't forget to thank Ms.
Kaur on my behalf.

609
01:11:29,426 --> 01:11:31,406
None of this could've
been possible without her.

610
01:11:32,062 --> 01:11:33,166
Don't be surprised, sir.

611
01:11:34,064 --> 01:11:35,737
Time is a game-changer.

612
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,510
Check Ms. Kaur's watch
when you've got the time.

613
01:11:40,704 --> 01:11:41,648
What's wrong?

614
01:11:42,706 --> 01:11:43,810
What are you doing, Yash?

615
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:03,033
Anjan, Shiv can be anywhere in Europe.

616
01:12:03,593 --> 01:12:06,403
And catching him now...is impossible.

617
01:12:06,563 --> 01:12:08,008
KK, there was a tracker
in your watch...

618
01:12:08,065 --> 01:12:09,567
...and it's a very serious charge.

619
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:11,710
What exactly happened that day?

620
01:12:14,171 --> 01:12:14,774
Freeze.

621
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:17,481
'It's you.'

622
01:12:18,442 --> 01:12:19,716
'I was scared for a moment.'

623
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:22,716
'Quietly handover the laptop,
and come with me to the embassy.'

624
01:12:23,447 --> 01:12:24,289
'Quietly?

625
01:12:25,315 --> 01:12:27,022
'That's one thing I can't do.'

626
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:31,165
'And you are 3 minute
and 30 seconds late.'

627
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,764
'I just deleted everything.
- Stay there.'

628
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:36,336
'Do you want to check?'

629
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:37,337
'Check.'

630
01:12:40,497 --> 01:12:41,737
I am really sorry, sir.

631
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,474
This is all my fault.

632
01:12:44,634 --> 01:12:46,580
I could've shot him, but I didn't.

633
01:12:48,038 --> 01:12:49,346
KK, we must order an inquiry on you.

634
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,481
Come back, I am sending a replacement.

635
01:12:51,641 --> 01:12:52,642
No!

636
01:12:53,443 --> 01:12:54,387
What?

637
01:12:55,278 --> 01:12:57,485
KK won't go back. - Yash...

638
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:59,458
KK is a capable officer,
and I trust her.

639
01:12:59,516 --> 01:13:01,120
But that tracker?
- He must have slipped it in...

640
01:13:01,184 --> 01:13:02,527
...when KK was unconscious.

641
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:15,702
It could've happened to anyone.

642
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:18,510
We will catch him, you've my word sir.

643
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:25,115
What?

644
01:13:28,678 --> 01:13:29,748
One thing's clear.

645
01:13:30,213 --> 01:13:32,557
He's giving them
one name after another.

646
01:13:33,049 --> 01:13:35,051
Surely the Chinese must
be giving him something.

647
01:13:35,419 --> 01:13:36,591
Yes, but what?

648
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,234
Anjan sir.

649
01:13:41,691 --> 01:13:44,262
Yes, sir.
- KK, there's been a development.

650
01:13:45,195 --> 01:13:48,335
We've been trying to turn a Chinese
official for the past <i>6</i> months.

651
01:13:48,532 --> 01:13:51,376
He's agreed...and he will
give us Shiv's location in one hour.

652
01:13:51,435 --> 01:13:53,676
So stand down and don't
move until I say so.

653
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:55,549
Got it? - Okay, sir.

654
01:13:56,139 --> 01:13:57,083
Yash, where are you going?

655
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:58,744
Didn't you hear we'll
be getting his location soon?

656
01:13:59,142 --> 01:14:00,553
Whatsapp me when you get it.

657
01:14:01,678 --> 01:14:02,679
Yash!

658
01:14:41,785 --> 01:14:44,698
Are you sure this
is what you want? - Yes.

659
01:14:45,489 --> 01:14:47,127
In two days I will
have my revenge on...

660
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:49,295
...lndia in a way that
it will never forget.

661
01:14:51,027 --> 01:14:53,337
But are you sure that
you guys can handle it.

662
01:14:56,766 --> 01:14:59,610
How about more names
of Indian spies amongst us?

663
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:02,447
The deal was five names now...

664
01:15:02,506 --> 01:15:04,986
...and five names
after the job is done.

665
01:15:05,175 --> 01:15:08,213
Yeah...so you owe us one more name.

666
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:16,587
Li Zhou Chen.

667
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:31,045
Li Zhou Chen? - Li Zhou Chen!

668
01:15:31,101 --> 01:15:32,171
Is this a joke?

669
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:36,146
That's my name.
- Then you must be the agent.

670
01:15:52,789 --> 01:15:54,029
I knew the Indians were trying"

671
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,797
...to turn one of yours
for the past few months.

672
01:15:56,059 --> 01:15:57,561
How did you know he was turned?

673
01:15:58,528 --> 01:16:01,532
On his 10th Anniversary
he bought his wife a 20 Euro scarf.

674
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:04,442
And this morning,
without any occasion...

675
01:16:05,135 --> 01:16:07,137
A 5000 Euro diamond ring.

676
01:16:11,241 --> 01:16:12,185
Poor gUY-

677
01:16:35,332 --> 01:16:39,007
'You think I am doing this for money.'

678
01:16:39,336 --> 01:16:42,180
'I am really disappointed
in you, sir.'

679
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:43,774
'Then why are you doing this?'

680
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,212
'What do you want?'

681
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:54,318
Where are you, sir? - At your home.

682
01:16:55,318 --> 01:16:57,059
When was the last time
you cleaned this place?

683
01:16:57,287 --> 01:16:59,096
Why do you always drop by unannounced?

684
01:16:59,155 --> 01:17:00,293
If you would have
alened me in advance...

685
01:17:00,357 --> 01:17:02,530
...I would've arranged
for some tea and snacks.

686
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:05,269
Do you need something...or did
you call to waste my time?

687
01:17:05,362 --> 01:17:08,241
Sir, do you know what is the
biggest problem of Indians are?

688
01:17:08,531 --> 01:17:10,408
So you called to waste my time.

689
01:17:12,168 --> 01:17:14,375
We Indians never do our job ourselves.

690
01:17:14,638 --> 01:17:16,049
We keep delegating it.

691
01:17:16,272 --> 01:17:20,652
Now see...a poor Chinese ended
up dead...trying to give away my location.

692
01:17:24,314 --> 01:17:25,554
Too bad

693
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:30,024
How about an advice... for free?

694
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:33,194
Stop looking for me.

695
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:37,403
Marry Ms. Kaur...and settle
down in some hill-station.

696
01:17:37,661 --> 01:17:39,299
You two are old enough now.

697
01:17:41,264 --> 01:17:42,709
Now here's my advice to you.

698
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,002
Sell your home...

699
01:17:45,468 --> 01:17:48,711
...and get used to living
in a room without windows.

700
01:18:24,441 --> 01:18:26,148
"Happy Birthday."

701
01:18:42,759 --> 01:18:44,033
April..

702
01:18:44,728 --> 01:18:47,004
April 2016

703
01:19:10,253 --> 01:19:11,357
Yes, boss.

704
01:19:11,521 --> 01:19:14,991
Samant. I've a job for you.
- I am listening boss

705
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:20,301
Yash, where are you?

706
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,103
That Chinese official... - He's dead.

707
01:19:22,432 --> 01:19:25,606
What? How? - Shiv.

708
01:19:27,437 --> 01:19:29,041
How will a RAW agent find him novfl

709
01:19:30,607 --> 01:19:32,484
My Hungarian contact... Martinez.

710
01:19:32,542 --> 01:19:33,418
Good.

711
01:19:33,476 --> 01:19:35,513
I'll call Anjan, you talk to Martinez.

712
01:19:35,578 --> 01:19:37,751
Martinez never takes any
calls...only replies to texts.

713
01:19:38,214 --> 01:19:39,158
I'll text him.

714
01:19:54,264 --> 01:19:56,437
This? Are you sure?

715
01:19:57,367 --> 01:19:58,641
This is the address he gave me.

716
01:20:09,145 --> 01:20:10,283
Where is Martinez?

717
01:20:10,346 --> 01:20:11,552
Martini?

718
01:20:11,614 --> 01:20:13,252
Where is Martinez?

719
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:14,755
<i>Viral, Martinez!</i>

720
01:20:15,118 --> 01:20:16,358
Looking for Martinez?

721
01:20:17,153 --> 01:20:18,291
Upstairs.

722
01:20:20,123 --> 01:20:21,124
Upstairs.

723
01:21:01,431 --> 01:21:02,569
Where is Martinez?

724
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:04,403
Martinez.

725
01:21:13,376 --> 01:21:14,047
Oh!

726
01:21:14,377 --> 01:21:16,357
What was that 'Oh'? - No, I thought...

727
01:21:16,412 --> 01:21:18,187
You thought it was a man.

728
01:21:20,116 --> 01:21:21,720
So you don't think girls are capable?

729
01:21:24,053 --> 01:21:25,031
How typical.

730
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:36,373
"O sweetheart... my eyes..."

731
01:21:36,432 --> 01:21:39,709
"...have been yearning for you."

732
01:21:40,069 --> 01:21:43,278
"O sweetheart...you weren't here..."

733
01:21:43,339 --> 01:21:46,650
"...and I held on to your memories."

734
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:49,815
"O sweetheart... my eyes..."

735
01:21:50,246 --> 01:21:53,557
"...have been yearning for you."

736
01:21:53,616 --> 01:21:56,688
"O sweetheart...you weren't here..."

737
01:21:57,153 --> 01:22:00,225
"...and I held on to your memories."

738
01:22:00,423 --> 01:22:03,563
"How do I explain..."

739
01:22:03,993 --> 01:22:09,238
"...the emotions stirring in my heart?"

740
01:22:10,633 --> 01:22:13,773
"The days and nights are unbearable."

741
01:22:14,037 --> 01:22:17,507
"I had to tell you
what's in my heart."

742
01:22:17,573 --> 01:22:20,679
"The days and nights are unbearable."

743
01:22:20,743 --> 01:22:24,520
"I had to tell you
what's in my heart."

744
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:31,122
"So I say this to you..."

745
01:22:31,387 --> 01:22:34,596
"I love you."

746
01:22:34,657 --> 01:22:38,161
"I love you."

747
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:41,538
"I love you."

748
01:22:41,597 --> 01:22:45,067
"I love you."

749
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:57,590
"As you looked at me..."

750
01:22:57,647 --> 01:23:00,992
heart felt an uproar."

751
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:04,395
"Your intoxication
is slowly growing on me."

752
01:23:04,454 --> 01:23:08,197
"And stealing my senses."

753
01:23:08,257 --> 01:23:15,573
"Stealing my senses."

754
01:23:16,065 --> 01:23:19,410
"The days and nights are unbearable."

755
01:23:19,469 --> 01:23:22,746
"I had to tell you
what's in my heart."

756
01:23:23,006 --> 01:23:26,283
"The days and nights are unbearable."

757
01:23:26,342 --> 01:23:29,721
"I had to tell you
what's in my heart."

758
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:36,463
"So I say this to you..."

759
01:23:36,519 --> 01:23:39,796
"I love you."

760
01:23:40,123 --> 01:23:43,400
"I love you."

761
01:23:43,459 --> 01:23:46,440
"I love you."

762
01:23:52,201 --> 01:23:54,681
"I love you."

763
01:24:02,378 --> 01:24:05,018
She doesn't have a
clue about where she is.

764
01:24:05,181 --> 01:24:07,183
How will she tell us about Shiv?

765
01:24:08,551 --> 01:24:11,725
We need to find someone,
Shiv Sharma.

766
01:24:13,122 --> 01:24:14,760
No problem, but I have 1 condition.

767
01:24:15,024 --> 01:24:20,372
I don't want money, I want to
do bang-bang with him.

768
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:22,132
What is she saying?

769
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:25,307
She's saying she will help us,
but in exchange...

770
01:24:25,368 --> 01:24:26,608
Just say yes to whatever she wants.

771
01:24:26,669 --> 01:24:28,444
Finding Shiv is more important.

772
01:24:31,707 --> 01:24:34,620
Are you sure? - Yes.

773
01:24:38,181 --> 01:24:39,023
Okay.

774
01:24:41,617 --> 01:24:43,062
You can do bang-bang with him.

775
01:24:45,288 --> 01:24:46,130
When?

776
01:24:46,522 --> 01:24:49,731
She's asking when? - Tell
her as soon as she does the job.

777
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:53,365
As soon as you give us the location.

778
01:24:53,663 --> 01:24:55,609
Sure... Tonight.

779
01:24:57,533 --> 01:24:59,171
Somethings fishy about her.

780
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:01,574
She never gave wrong
information till date.

781
01:25:02,105 --> 01:25:04,176
And I think she will
give it to you tonight.

782
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,446
How do you know?

783
01:25:07,243 --> 01:25:10,122
She seems to be in a hurry.
- What for?

784
01:25:13,116 --> 01:25:17,462
Ask him to take a shower,
he smells like shit.

785
01:25:19,555 --> 01:25:20,727
What did she say now?

786
01:25:26,062 --> 01:25:27,234
She says take a bath.

787
01:26:07,737 --> 01:26:08,738
How did you get in?

788
01:26:09,472 --> 01:26:11,042
Clothes for you.

789
01:26:12,308 --> 01:26:13,548
Do you have Shiv's location?

790
01:26:16,179 --> 01:26:17,385
Why did you toss away the clothes?

791
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:20,019
You want to have sex on this?

792
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:21,058
What are you saying?

793
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,258
Let me take it off...
- Where are you going?

794
01:26:23,352 --> 01:26:25,161
Get off! - "don't be shy.

795
01:26:25,321 --> 01:26:27,392
You cheat...

796
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:29,697
Moron!

797
01:26:29,759 --> 01:26:32,467
I've had enough of you, get lost.

798
01:26:33,329 --> 01:26:36,776
Get lost.
- We had a deal, you are a cheater.

799
01:27:06,395 --> 01:27:07,396
Yash!

800
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:17,743
Wait!

801
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:20,153
What's wrong...that was quick.

802
01:27:20,543 --> 01:27:23,285
So that was her condition?
- Yes... but...why?

803
01:27:23,346 --> 01:27:24,654
Didn't anything happen?
- Are you crazy?

804
01:27:24,714 --> 01:27:25,590
Have you lost your mind?

805
01:27:25,648 --> 01:27:32,657
KK...you're a deal breaker.
Now this will cost you double.

806
01:27:32,722 --> 01:27:33,564
No problem.

807
01:27:34,023 --> 01:27:36,196
Moron.

808
01:27:36,259 --> 01:27:37,533
Rascal.

809
01:27:40,162 --> 01:27:41,573
Shiv is in Holloko Village.

810
01:29:25,668 --> 01:29:28,444
It's still hot...he
couldn't have gone too far.

811
01:29:30,506 --> 01:29:31,610
He must be somewhere around.

812
01:29:36,379 --> 01:29:39,053
<i>Yes, Samar“.
- Shiv Sharma was in this orphanage.</i>

813
01:29:39,115 --> 01:29:41,026
But he died 10 years ago.

814
01:29:44,553 --> 01:29:45,293
Hello?

815
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:47,365
Hello?

816
01:30:55,524 --> 01:30:56,332
Yash, no!

817
01:31:12,374 --> 01:31:13,182
Sh",

818
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:15,049
Balraj, talk to the home
minister if you have to...

819
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:16,180
...but just get it done.

820
01:31:17,646 --> 01:31:18,454
<i>Yes, '(ash.</i>

821
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:22,018
Sir...he's not Shiv Sharma...and
maybe he's not an orphan either.

822
01:31:22,151 --> 01:31:24,563
Whoever he is,
he stole Shiv Sharma's identity.

823
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:26,531
Use all your resources in India.

824
01:31:26,589 --> 01:31:27,624
Start with the orphanage...

825
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:31,035
...and find out everything you
can about this imposter in 24 hours.

826
01:31:31,093 --> 01:31:32,663
And I mean everything! - Okay.

827
01:31:35,331 --> 01:31:37,038
Mhatre, assemble a team!

828
01:32:20,109 --> 01:32:21,087
Good job.

829
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:24,420
Are you crazy?
Why did you stay back in the village?

830
01:32:25,047 --> 01:32:26,151
Because if they didn't see me...

831
01:32:26,215 --> 01:32:27,489
...they wouldn't trust you.

832
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:32,324
Now they will trust
whatever you tell them.

833
01:32:33,355 --> 01:32:34,231
Smart!

834
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:38,435
And hitting those
men was a good touch!

835
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:41,667
See you!

836
01:33:13,262 --> 01:33:16,766
Martinez. - Now what do you want?

837
01:33:17,032 --> 01:33:18,739
He got away,
we need his next location.

838
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:21,379
More money or get out.

839
01:33:21,437 --> 01:33:22,780
What is she saying this time?

840
01:33:23,172 --> 01:33:24,412
Will she do the job or not?

841
01:33:26,008 --> 01:33:26,611
She will.

842
01:34:07,249 --> 01:34:09,251
Where do you want me to send them?

843
01:34:10,653 --> 01:34:11,631
Berlin.

844
01:34:13,155 --> 01:34:15,726
Send them to Berlin. - Okay.

845
01:34:49,525 --> 01:34:50,333
What?

846
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:53,301
I know you don't drink coffee.

847
01:34:59,034 --> 01:34:59,637
Can I ask you something?

848
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:03,609
Why did you support me the other
day in front of Anjan?

849
01:35:04,306 --> 01:35:05,284
Because I am crazy.

850
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:09,453
Completely eccentric!

851
01:35:20,289 --> 01:35:22,326
In 2013 we received a tip-off,"

852
01:35:23,192 --> 01:35:26,401
"that a radical-terrorist was
hiding-out in a lodge in Lajpat Nagar.

853
01:35:27,229 --> 01:35:29,641
We arrived at the scene,
he made a run for it.

854
01:35:31,133 --> 01:35:34,478
I could've shot him...
but that day I couldn't.

855
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:39,076
Two days later he killed five people.

856
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:42,089
Since that day, l...

857
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,637
Harish and I,
were childhood friends.

858
01:36:00,562 --> 01:36:03,065
We even went to school
and college together.

859
01:36:03,599 --> 01:36:06,102
In fact, we even joined
the force together.

860
01:36:07,002 --> 01:36:09,380
He would often joke about
howjoke about how crazy I am.

861
01:36:10,439 --> 01:36:11,509
Completely lunatic.

862
01:36:14,309 --> 01:36:15,481
Someone will definitely kill me...

863
01:36:16,111 --> 01:36:18,113
...and he will investigate my murder.

864
01:36:20,282 --> 01:36:22,990
Neither he, nor I ever imagined...

865
01:36:23,051 --> 01:36:25,258
...that I will be
investigating his murder.

866
01:36:33,362 --> 01:36:34,238
We'll get him.

867
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,610
Sir. - You were right.

868
01:36:48,043 --> 01:36:49,021
His name isn't Shiv.

869
01:36:50,145 --> 01:36:51,590
His real name is Rudra Pratap Singh.

870
01:36:52,047 --> 01:36:55,153
His father, Karan Pratap Singh was
an undercover agent for RAW in China.

871
01:36:57,586 --> 01:37:00,533
The Chinese Intelligence Agency
found out that he was a RAW agent.

872
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:04,396
RAW disowned him on our
cabinet secretary's orders.

873
01:37:05,561 --> 01:37:07,507
That's the fact about
the world of spying.

874
01:37:08,397 --> 01:37:10,206
If you're caught, we don't know you.

875
01:37:10,599 --> 01:37:14,046
Which is why he assumed the name
and identity of his deceased friend...

876
01:37:14,403 --> 01:37:16,007
...so that he can
take revenge against RAW.

877
01:37:16,438 --> 01:37:18,645
When did this happen? - 2012.

878
01:37:20,609 --> 01:37:23,613
Yash...I'll call you
as soon as I reach to Berlin.

879
01:37:24,646 --> 01:37:25,716
Take care.

880
01:37:27,382 --> 01:37:28,588
Rudra Pratap Singh?

881
01:37:29,318 --> 01:37:31,195
He isn't trying to take
revenge from RAW. - What?

882
01:37:31,687 --> 01:37:33,132
It's an open and shut case, Yash.

883
01:37:33,188 --> 01:37:34,428
He killed four of our agents.

884
01:37:34,489 --> 01:37:36,264
If this isn't revenge,
then what is it?

885
01:37:37,025 --> 01:37:38,129
It's not that simple.

886
01:37:39,695 --> 01:37:43,108
He wants to use RAW to
get to someone else. - Who?

887
01:37:46,768 --> 01:37:49,339
Where are you going novfl
- To find answer to your question.

888
01:37:53,742 --> 01:37:56,245
Yes, dad...I'm just
leaving for the airport.

889
01:37:56,478 --> 01:37:57,548
When are you reaching India?

890
01:37:57,613 --> 01:37:58,683
What time is your flight?

891
01:38:02,484 --> 01:38:05,488
Son...feels like I
won't be able to make it.

892
01:38:05,687 --> 01:38:08,167
Please don't say you're
tied up with work.

893
01:38:09,424 --> 01:38:12,598
L...l...l wanted to
come to Seattle instead.

894
01:38:13,428 --> 01:38:15,374
Stroll into your office.

895
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:17,341
See how you're working.

896
01:38:19,034 --> 01:38:20,707
Later we could've gone for a walk.

897
01:38:23,572 --> 01:38:25,051
And have a beer together...

898
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:26,685
We could've had a beer together.

899
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:31,554
We never had a beer together, did we?

900
01:38:31,613 --> 01:38:33,991
Yes, dad...but why
are you saying this now?

901
01:38:34,049 --> 01:38:35,027
Did something happen?

902
01:38:36,718 --> 01:38:40,291
Okay...l hid something from you...

903
01:38:40,355 --> 01:38:42,995
No, I hid something from all of you.

904
01:38:43,225 --> 01:38:45,171
I want to tell you about it. - What?

905
01:38:45,394 --> 01:38:47,340
Dad...l don't understand
what you're saying.

906
01:38:47,396 --> 01:38:48,431
Is something wrong?

907
01:38:48,597 --> 01:38:50,008
For the last 30 years...

908
01:38:51,533 --> 01:38:57,540
I've been working for RAV\I...and
not some tech company.

909
01:38:57,706 --> 01:39:03,384
RAW? Dad, is this a joke?
- I wish it was.

910
01:39:04,613 --> 01:39:07,594
Father. . .you're scaring me.

911
01:39:07,649 --> 01:39:09,651
Please leave now...

912
01:39:09,718 --> 01:39:11,698
Things will be fine
when we meet again.

913
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:16,433
It's too late, son.

914
01:39:16,558 --> 01:39:19,266
What do you mean it's too late?
Why are you saying such things?

915
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:22,070
Please just leavemeverything
will be fine.

916
01:39:22,431 --> 01:39:23,967
I just want to say one thing.

917
01:39:26,101 --> 01:39:31,016
Look after your mother and sister.
- Father, please...

918
01:39:31,239 --> 01:39:33,150
And I want to tell you one last time.

919
01:39:39,581 --> 01:39:44,587
L...love you.
- And I love you too, father, but...

920
01:39:57,132 --> 01:39:59,373
The media has turned
this into a farce.

921
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:02,345
Karan Pratap is not a RAW Agent.

922
01:40:02,771 --> 01:40:05,650
Karan Pratap has no connection
with RAW whatsoever.

923
01:40:05,707 --> 01:40:07,311
But his family claims that...

924
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:09,617
...he was working for
RAW for the last 30 years.

925
01:40:10,312 --> 01:40:13,350
Look...even we heard
that he was working for China.

926
01:40:13,582 --> 01:40:16,062
He was selling India's
secrets to China.

927
01:40:16,251 --> 01:40:17,559
Now...who do we believe?

928
01:40:17,619 --> 01:40:20,156
Are you trying to say that
Karan Pratap was a traitor?

929
01:40:20,222 --> 01:40:21,701
You're all smart people.

930
01:40:22,157 --> 01:40:23,363
You know what's best.

931
01:40:23,592 --> 01:40:25,765
No more questions please, thank you.

932
01:40:37,305 --> 01:40:40,343
Mom... - Your father's bank balance...

933
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:42,047
...has been transferred in your names.

934
01:40:43,211 --> 01:40:44,349
And the Locker as well.

935
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,684
There isn't much in it.

936
01:40:47,215 --> 01:40:49,286
Just...few of my jewellery,

937
01:40:50,252 --> 01:40:54,359
I guess your father...was too honest,
wasn't he?

938
01:40:55,057 --> 01:40:56,297
Mom, please...

939
01:40:56,358 --> 01:40:59,305
I met with the Cabinet Secretary...

940
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:02,170
He said there's nothing
that can be done.

941
01:41:03,665 --> 01:41:07,545
I tried to explain
that I have two kids.

942
01:41:09,237 --> 01:41:10,545
But he said...

943
01:41:11,473 --> 01:41:15,649
"You...will have to live
with this label of a traitor".

944
01:41:20,382 --> 01:41:21,554
I can't take this anymore.

945
01:41:22,117 --> 01:41:23,221
“Horn!

946
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:52,724
'You were right.'

947
01:41:53,381 --> 01:41:54,519
'His name isn't Shiv.'

948
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:57,459
'His real name is Rudra Pratap Singh.'

949
01:42:01,623 --> 01:42:04,661
'His father, Karan Pratap Singh was
an undercover agent for RAW in China.'

950
01:42:06,094 --> 01:42:09,405
'Let's not argue over
patriotism and treachery.'

951
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:11,109
'You will lose.'

952
01:42:13,235 --> 01:42:16,182
'The Chinese Intelligence Agency
found out that he was a RAW agent.'

953
01:42:16,771 --> 01:42:20,150
'RAW disowned him on our
cabinet secretary's orders.'

954
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:22,586
'You think I am doing this for money.'

955
01:42:22,644 --> 01:42:25,056
'I am really disappointed
in you, sir.'

956
01:42:26,481 --> 01:42:29,553
'When did this happen? - 2012.'

957
01:42:29,751 --> 01:42:31,355
2012!

958
01:42:38,093 --> 01:42:40,130
2012!

959
01:42:40,395 --> 01:42:41,635
'Now this game's
going to be fun, sir.'

960
01:42:41,696 --> 01:42:45,667
'Killing 6 people is a game for you.
- I didn't start this game, sir.'

961
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:48,181
2012.

962
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:50,181
'In 2012 he became
the cabinet secretary.'

963
01:42:50,238 --> 01:42:51,615
'He contested the elections
from Meerut and became the MP.'

964
01:42:51,673 --> 01:42:54,119
'And a year later he
became the HRD Minister.'

965
01:42:54,176 --> 01:42:56,713
'This is Brijesh Verma.
HRD Minister.'

966
01:42:57,479 --> 01:43:01,120
'He began his career
in 1988...as an IAS officer.'

967
01:43:01,183 --> 01:43:04,562
'Look...even we heard
that he was working for China.'

968
01:43:04,686 --> 01:43:07,292
'He was selling India's
secrets to China.'

969
01:43:07,622 --> 01:43:09,295
'Now...who do we believe?'

970
01:43:16,698 --> 01:43:17,506
Yash!

971
01:43:17,632 --> 01:43:18,440
Yash!

972
01:43:18,567 --> 01:43:20,444
Martinez just called,
Rudra is in Berlin.

973
01:43:20,502 --> 01:43:22,482
Anjan is arriving their tomorrow,
he's his next target.

974
01:43:22,537 --> 01:43:23,447
We need to rush.

975
01:43:23,505 --> 01:43:25,576
Rudra isn't in Berlin,
he's right here.

976
01:43:26,041 --> 01:43:27,679
What nonsense. How do you know?

977
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:30,622
Because he wants to kill
the HRD Minister Brijesh Verma.

978
01:43:32,347 --> 01:43:34,156
Right here...in Budapest.

979
01:45:21,456 --> 01:45:23,231
So Rudra chose to
be posted in Budapest...

980
01:45:23,291 --> 01:45:25,430
...because this summit
was planned almost a year ago.

981
01:45:25,493 --> 01:45:26,437
Exactly.

982
01:45:26,494 --> 01:45:28,440
And sending us to Berlin
was one of his plans.

983
01:45:28,496 --> 01:45:30,373
He knew Anjan's going there.

984
01:45:31,099 --> 01:45:32,635
That means Martinez!

985
01:45:35,036 --> 01:45:35,741
Bu”

986
01:45:36,004 --> 01:45:38,109
<i>We must stop this summit, '(ash
- No.</i>

987
01:45:38,173 --> 01:45:41,518
If we stop this summit,
we'll never catch Rudra.

988
01:45:41,576 --> 01:45:44,022
Are you going to let a
minister die just to catch Rudra?

989
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:47,253
Of course not,
we're going to save him. - How ?

990
01:45:48,249 --> 01:45:50,729
We'll shoot him. - What?

991
01:46:02,063 --> 01:46:04,509
The only difference is
they will shoot to kill...

992
01:46:05,133 --> 01:46:06,441
...and we'll shoot to save him.

993
01:46:06,501 --> 01:46:08,503
But what's the guarantee
that Rudra's going to be there.

994
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:11,016
He will be. I just know it.

995
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,416
Yash, finding him
there will be impossible.

996
01:46:13,475 --> 01:46:14,749
When the bullets will be fired...

997
01:46:15,143 --> 01:46:17,384
...only one man in the hall won't run.

998
01:46:17,612 --> 01:46:19,285
Rudra Pratap Singh!

999
01:46:19,347 --> 01:46:20,621
Yash, this is crazy.

1000
01:46:20,682 --> 01:46:23,322
Putting a minister's life
at stake like this is wrong.

1001
01:46:23,385 --> 01:46:26,059
Even the minister's should
help their country when in need.

1002
01:46:36,998 --> 01:46:39,137
I can't believe that you're
going to shoot the minister.

1003
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:41,237
Not me...you are.

1004
01:46:47,375 --> 01:46:49,048
Yash, I can't do it.

1005
01:46:49,477 --> 01:46:50,649
I can't shoot the minister.

1006
01:46:50,712 --> 01:46:53,556
We don't have any other option.
- Yash, why don't you understand?

1007
01:46:53,615 --> 01:46:56,562
I can't shoot. - You can.

1008
01:46:57,018 --> 01:46:58,520
You cannot fail twice.

1009
01:46:58,753 --> 01:46:59,788
Trust me!

1010
01:47:00,388 --> 01:47:02,595
You won't. Come on.

1011
01:48:03,985 --> 01:48:06,397
Thank you everyone for coming.

1012
01:48:06,654 --> 01:48:07,632
It gives me great pleasure...

1013
01:48:07,689 --> 01:48:10,135
...to welcome the Indian HRD Minister

1014
01:48:10,191 --> 01:48:12,398
...Mr. Brijesh Verma, to Hungary.

1015
01:48:12,727 --> 01:48:17,005
I'd like to call upon him to open...

1016
01:48:17,065 --> 01:48:20,012
...the first lndo-Hungarian Summit.

1017
01:48:20,068 --> 01:48:21,046
Mr. Verma!

1018
01:48:29,043 --> 01:48:29,748
Thank you

1019
01:48:35,116 --> 01:48:36,390
Thank you, Minister.

1020
01:48:37,151 --> 01:48:38,562
Respected dignitaries.

1021
01:48:39,087 --> 01:48:40,532
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1022
01:48:42,490 --> 01:48:49,135
This is indeed...definitely
going to be a new dawn...

1023
01:48:49,564 --> 01:48:52,340
...in Hungarian-lndo friendship.

1024
01:48:54,035 --> 01:48:55,639
'You cannot fail twice.'

1025
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:56,680
'Trust me!'

1026
01:48:56,738 --> 01:49:00,618
We look forward to
further collaboration...

1027
01:49:00,675 --> 01:49:03,155
...to strengthen our friendship.

1028
01:49:03,378 --> 01:49:08,384
A friendship that is based
on common goals, and vision.

1029
01:49:08,616 --> 01:49:10,220
Both the countries...

1030
01:54:08,049 --> 01:54:11,622
No use...l am going to
kill this bloody minister.

1031
01:54:11,686 --> 01:54:15,099
What nonsense is this? Who is he?

1032
01:54:15,323 --> 01:54:17,269
Karan Pratap's son.

1033
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:19,399
Karan Pratap?

1034
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:22,402
The one you had killed. - Killed?

1035
01:54:22,463 --> 01:54:25,342
What nonsense.
That was standard RAW protocol.

1036
01:54:26,167 --> 01:54:27,441
30 years...

1037
01:54:27,702 --> 01:54:30,114
Father dedicated 30 years
of his life to RAW and his country...

1038
01:54:30,171 --> 01:54:31,172
...but what did he get in return?

1039
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:33,014
He was labelled as a traitor!

1040
01:54:33,207 --> 01:54:34,515
And a disgraceful death.

1041
01:54:34,575 --> 01:54:37,681
Every RAW Agent knows the
consequences if they are caught.

1042
01:54:37,745 --> 01:54:40,157
Even your father. - And my mom?

1043
01:54:42,717 --> 01:54:44,355
What was my mother's fault?

1044
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:48,100
My mother killed
herself because of you.

1045
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:52,464
What he did with
your family was wrong.

1046
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,437
But you're doing the same thing.

1047
01:54:55,162 --> 01:54:58,632
If I've to ruin 100 more
families to get to him, l...

1048
01:54:58,699 --> 01:55:00,042
You're forgetting one thing.

1049
01:55:00,234 --> 01:55:03,511
I am holding the gun...and
you will be going to jail.

1050
01:55:07,041 --> 01:55:08,145
Jail?

1051
01:55:11,212 --> 01:55:13,692
Do you know how many
undercover RAW agents...

1052
01:55:13,748 --> 01:55:15,557
...are there in China and Hong Kong?

1053
01:55:17,084 --> 01:55:18,256
Do you know?

1054
01:55:20,354 --> 01:55:21,458
Seventeen!

1055
01:55:22,556 --> 01:55:24,558
And how many names do I know?

1056
01:55:24,625 --> 01:55:25,626
All of them.

1057
01:55:26,527 --> 01:55:28,370
All the names are up here.

1058
01:55:28,729 --> 01:55:31,232
How many are you going
to deem as traitors?

1059
01:55:31,732 --> 01:55:33,177
I will go to jail...

1060
01:55:33,501 --> 01:55:37,677
...but I will give all the names
to the Chinese...so I can kill you.

1061
01:55:38,472 --> 01:55:41,544
17 agents will die, until you... - No!

1062
01:55:45,579 --> 01:55:48,651
Sir...they will die...

1063
01:56:00,027 --> 01:56:02,234
No more RAW agents
are going to die now.

1064
01:56:09,704 --> 01:56:11,741
Good job officer, well done.

1065
01:56:14,742 --> 01:56:17,348
I didn't shoot him to save you.

1066
01:56:18,512 --> 01:56:21,584
I saved those 17 RAW agents.

1067
01:56:22,049 --> 01:56:24,689
What? - Your life is still in danger.

1068
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,158
What are you doing?

1069
01:56:30,291 --> 01:56:31,702
You must fix everything
Rudra's mother...

1070
01:56:31,759 --> 01:56:34,603
...and the rest of the RAW
agent's family had to go through.

1071
01:56:34,662 --> 01:56:35,663
Meaning?

1072
01:56:35,730 --> 01:56:39,439
I've done my duty, now you do yours.

1073
01:56:48,376 --> 01:56:49,480
Do it, sir...

1074
01:56:51,012 --> 01:56:53,253
He's a bit wayward, he will kill you.

1075
01:56:59,453 --> 01:57:03,094
The government has taken
a very important step today.

1076
01:57:03,391 --> 01:57:07,134
Those RAW agents who
were deemed as traitors...

1077
01:57:07,194 --> 01:57:09,970
...their names are being cleared.

1078
01:57:10,031 --> 01:57:12,238
Mr. Verma. - Yes.

1079
01:57:12,366 --> 01:57:16,143
We ordered an inquiry
which led us to the fact...

1080
01:57:16,203 --> 01:57:19,616
...that those RAW
agents were not traitors.

1081
01:57:20,074 --> 01:57:22,418
Other than clearing their names...

1082
01:57:22,476 --> 01:57:24,513
...we will also
compensate their family.

1083
01:57:24,578 --> 01:57:31,223
Karan Pratap Singh, Harish Chaturvedi,
Suraj Rawat, Arshad Khan...Manjeet Singh,

1084
01:57:31,285 --> 01:57:35,597
...Rahul Rajput aur Mahesh Deshpande,
and many more patriots like them...

1085
01:57:35,656 --> 01:57:39,229
...laid down their
life for this country.

1086
01:57:39,293 --> 01:57:43,764
Tonight their family will be lighting
a lamp in their homes in your name.

1087
01:57:44,031 --> 01:57:48,502
Wellmthose RAW agents did
their duty, and I'm just doing mine.

1088
01:57:50,371 --> 01:57:52,146
Good job, ACP sir.

1089
01:57:58,212 --> 01:57:59,418
Not bad, huh!

1090
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,222
You finally learnt how to
use your heart along with your head.

1091
01:58:04,985 --> 01:58:08,660
By the way...she's nice. - Who?

1092
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:10,525
Who are you talking to?

1093
01:58:15,396 --> 01:58:17,239
You're watching 'Sachayi ki Awaaz'
and with us is the HRD..

1094
01:58:17,298 --> 01:58:18,470
Minister Brijesh Verma,

1095
01:58:18,532 --> 01:58:19,237
No one.

1096
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:20,745
Who has raised his voice in
support of our RAW Agents.

1097
01:58:21,001 --> 01:58:23,641
And his voice is
echoing all over the country.

1098
01:58:24,605 --> 01:58:27,484
So the Minister finally
found a way around.

1099
01:58:31,178 --> 01:58:32,680
It was nice working with you.

1100
01:58:35,516 --> 01:58:36,654
Same here.

1101
01:58:36,717 --> 01:58:38,219
Take care of yourself.

1102
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:44,192
And for the first time, our government
hasn't just restored their honor,..

1103
01:58:44,258 --> 01:58:46,499
"But also their identity.

1104
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:49,700
Our country is really changing.

1105
01:59:09,517 --> 01:59:11,360
"I don't get it...

1106
01:59:12,686 --> 01:59:14,359
why do only good people die?"

1107
01:59:15,556 --> 01:59:17,968
"Why does bad things
happen to the good."

1108
01:59:19,059 --> 01:59:20,732
"Those who should be crying,
are laughing."

1109
01:59:21,529 --> 01:59:23,304
"Those who should be laughing,
are crying."

1110
01:59:24,131 --> 01:59:26,077
"I've had enough of this."

1111
01:59:26,534 --> 01:59:28,707
"I've stayed silent for too long."

1112
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:31,245
"Now listen to the
uproar in my heart."

1113
01:59:31,472 --> 01:59:33,509
"Listen to my intents."

1114
01:59:33,641 --> 01:59:36,053
"Obsession is my nature."

1115
01:59:36,110 --> 01:59:38,147
"It's stubborn...and I am high on it."

1116
01:59:38,212 --> 01:59:42,354
"And only I know...where you stand."

1117
01:59:42,416 --> 01:59:44,327
"The game you just played...

1118
01:59:44,385 --> 01:59:46,387
...you're going to lose."

1119
01:59:46,453 --> 01:59:48,433
"How long are you going to..."

1120
01:59:48,489 --> 01:59:50,594
...throw stones at
us thinking we're glass."

1121
01:59:50,658 --> 01:59:52,660
"It's boiling in every vein."

1122
01:59:52,726 --> 01:59:55,002
"Listen up, it's saying..."

1123
01:59:55,062 --> 01:59:59,238
"It's going insane..."

1124
02:00:00,401 --> 02:00:02,506
"The color red... red.

1125
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:04,572

"meverything has changed."

1135
02:00:48,482 --> 02:00:50,086

02:00:50,618 --> 02:00:52,495
"...we'll slap back thousand times."

1137
02:00:53,387 --> 02:00:55,060
"if you try to intimidate us..."

1138
02:00:55,456 --> 02:00:57,458
"...we will rip you apart."

1139
02:00:58,459 --> 02:01:01,406
"We promise you...our
force promises you."

1140
02:01:01,996 --> 02:01:03,998
"Every bullet in my chamber...

1141
02:01:04,064 --> 02:01:06,135
has your name on it."

1142
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:08,237
"We won't miss our aim this time..."

1143
02:01:08,302 --> 02:01:10,304
"...we're determined."

1144
02:01:10,371 --> 02:01:14,478
"We never bow...nor
can we ever betray."

away...we are ready."
