1
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,340
'O birds, you are all over this world'

2
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,390
'You have spread your wings
right up to Heaven'

3
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,100
'Our earth and our skies
abound in these birds'

4
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,600
'Feathered creatures of our world!'

5
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,279
Any idea what to ask?

6
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,999
'Vanakkam'

7
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,439
We are from Excel Engineering college.

8
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:48,839
Robotic research students.

9
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,479
We've got an appointment
to meet Dr Vaseegaran.

10
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:52,559
Please come in.

11
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:55,638
Dude, soooper hyperbola!

12
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,957
Excuse me You are-

13
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,238
I am Dr Vaseegaran's assistant.

14
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:02,158
Your name - Nila.

15
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:04,198
- Beauuuutiful!
- Thanks.

16
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:06,317
Nila... moon!

17
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:07,437
What?

18
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,517
It's a lie to say
there's no gravity in the moon.

19
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:12,076
- Why?
- You are such a magnetic force!

20
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:13,838
Your laughter can be my ringtone!

21
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:15,077
Can I have your number?

22
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,757
11423879

23
00:07:19,116 --> 00:07:21,197
Enough! The whole floor is slippery!

24
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:26,996
Hello, sir.

25
00:07:27,116 --> 00:07:28,476
Please sit down.

26
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:31,235
Doctor, we are mechatronic students.

27
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:35,555
Professor Mithra told us you have
created a new humanoid robot.

28
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:37,595
- Can we take a look at that?
- Sure.

29
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,713
This is the new robot I have created.

30
00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:46,995
Project Nila.

31
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:49,874
Nice, intelligent, lovely assistant.

32
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:52,794
Humanoid X12 2018 model.

33
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:54,313
Quantum Core Millenia.

34
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:56,153
X12 5D Extreme processor.

35
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:57,594
Unlimited Cloud memory

36
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:58,914
1 Tera hertz speed.

37
00:07:58,955 --> 00:08:01,073
Built in simulated Amygdala.

38
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:04,314
This is her MPU
Memory and Power Unit.

39
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:05,752
Works like our heart.

40
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:07,673
MPU!

41
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:08,872
Synthetic skin.

42
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:10,232
Ultra realistic humanoid.

43
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:14,273
You are such a magnetic force!

44
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:19,472
What about that phone ♪?

45
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:21,072
That's my IMEI ♪

46
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:24,711
- Is she also like Chitti, doctor?
- No.

47
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:28,111
Created adhering to Asimov's laws
this is a domestic purpose robot.

48
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:30,592
You can treat her as your friend,
secretary and caretaker.

49
00:08:30,632 --> 00:08:33,431
She will be of help to mankind
in all ways and always.

50
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,711
Does it have feelings, doctor?

51
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,429
Yes, pre programmed,
customizable, controlled feelings.

52
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,790
Is there any chance for Chitti
to resurface again, doctor?

53
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,069
All our present scientific inventions
in the beginning were opposed as dangerous.

54
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,589
And labelled as null and void.

55
00:08:58,709 --> 00:08:59,989
Bound by time.

56
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:02,229
It became a necessity
in the ensuing years.

57
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:04,428
Chitti will also be a
pre requisite one day.

58
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:05,588
Dot!

59
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,908
Hey Nikita - Go to hell!

60
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:11,868
Bulb! Serves you right!

61
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:13,748
Nikita, hear me out

62
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:16,747
I acted as if I was flirting with her
just to make you see red.

63
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:19,107
- As if I didn't know she's a robot?
- 'Get lost, liar!'

64
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:21,068
My Barbie doll
My Snow White princess!

65
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:22,347
'Shut up and hang up!'

66
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:25,587
Believe me, I've booked
an Apple watch for your birthday.

67
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:22,142
Sushma, Moksha has got
a new Collection today.

68
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:24,262
You eat and then I'll come over, okay?

69
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:32,021
My flight was delayed
Inform the clients, I'll be there by-

70
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:38,861
When I get back from work
I chat with my family nonstop!

71
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:40,661
We spend quality time you know.

72
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,141
You bloody swine!

73
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,701
Harith, can I have my phone?

74
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,141
Daddy has to make an important call.

75
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:50,820
Give me the phone.

76
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,740
Don't cry... here.

77
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:02,020
I didn't do anything.

78
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,459
What is the bid today
in our chit fund?

79
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,579
Can get Rs 3000.

80
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,499
What is this?

81
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,699
Make 'rasam' and potato curry
for dinner, enough.

82
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:23,498
Grandpa!

83
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:26,537
'Residing in all of that as Me'

84
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:30,537
'So that Me through this Me'

85
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:31,777
'Talking to Me'

86
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:37,016
Dude, this must be
our principal's handiwork!

87
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,456
Where are you, dear?

88
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:48,176
Coming to the terrace?

89
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:50,055
What happened?

90
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:52,696
Our project manager and
prickly 'Jackfruit' Asha

91
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:54,335
are hand and glove in this.

92
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,455
That's why he promoted her
and sent her abroad on site.

93
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:02,134
He went to get the bore-well man
No sign of him still.

94
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:04,655
Tomorrow is Mahavir Jayanthi
All the shops will be closed.

95
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:06,335
Buy our stuff tonight, okay?

96
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,375
This phone has 4G, Wifi, Bluetooth
plus dual Sim capacity.

97
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,013
I'm in Ranganathan street,
jam packed with men all around.

98
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,133
Danger Girlfriend calling.

99
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,812
Hi Sana - 'Hi scientist sir'

100
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,492
'Wonder of wonders
You picked my call?'

101
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,291
- Sorry, Sana.
- 'How many calls?'

102
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,651
'Can't you even pick my call?
Are you that busy?'

103
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:52,292
'Just for your sake I'm 10,000 km away
and studying here like a lunatic'

104
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:55,810
'Under the pretext of working on
your project, are you flirting with Nila?'

105
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,091
That's a robot, Sana.

106
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,411
'But a female doll, right?'

107
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,730
Don't be mad at me, honey.

108
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,489
'I called you 112 times!'

109
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,251
I'll accept your punishment
and kiss you 112 times.

110
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,649
'No need 112'

111
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,690
'Just 1 phone-kiss, let me see'

112
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,810
Mua-

113
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,009
Flying kiss?!

114
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,329
Sir, where should I complain
to retrieve my mobile?

115
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,888
All of them are waiting too!
Go and stand in the queue.

116
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:25,289
How can a cell phone fly?
And where will it go?

117
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,568
Who is behind all this?
What is the reason?

118
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,488
'Is a whole gang behind this
or just an individual?'

119
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:31,608
'This is scary'

120
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:34,207
Is this a sign our world
will perish as people claim?

121
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,207
Like the ozone hole there is
a black hole in the sky it seems.

122
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:38,888
It has sucked all the phones I believe.

123
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:40,047
Yov! Shut up, man.

124
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,967
You're talking as if it's a drainage hole

125
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:44,726
I'm in the share market
My job is dependent on cell phones.

126
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:48,407
Life is absolutely boring
without WhatsApp and selfies.

127
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:50,767
As soon as I wake up
I take my mobile to the loo

128
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:52,326
I feel I've lost my hand now!

129
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,927
My husband is working in Qatar.

130
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,326
Our long distance romance
is only through cell phone

131
00:13:56,366 --> 00:14:00,045
I've saved my mom's ♪ as 'Amma'
I don't even know her landline ♪ now

132
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:04,526
I've stored my bank account ♪,
ATM pin ♪, password, the whole works

133
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:07,365
It has personal videos and photos
of my girlfriend and me.

134
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:09,365
What if they are uploaded
on an adult site?

135
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:12,004
Excuse me, is there a separate section
for Android phones?

136
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:15,885
For sure! It has been opened
in Parthasarathy temple, go there.

137
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:19,404
Sir, I'm very sentimental
about this cell phone.

138
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,724
Do something, sir.

139
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:22,204
How can I take this as a complaint?

140
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,245
- Get lost!
- Sir, please

141
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:25,484
I had hooked my wedding chain
on my mobile, sir

142
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,804
I lost that too

143
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,363
10 sovereign Pure gold, sir.

144
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:31,043
No wife to nag, no phone bills
to pay, why don't you relax?

145
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,803
God will be appeased if you do
a redemption ritual in Thirunallar, sir.

146
00:14:34,843 --> 00:14:36,324
You and your silly superstitions!

147
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:38,284
Commissioner sir asked me to meet you

148
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:39,603
I'll take care, sir.

149
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,042
Thank you.

150
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,603
Telecom minister is on the line.

151
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:46,219
Sir, even our chief minister
has lost his mobile.

152
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:47,923
He is on another line.

153
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:50,722
Your secretary is right here
I'll handle it, sir.

154
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,683
Sir, minister's phone-

155
00:14:54,642 --> 00:14:56,362
I've embedded precious stones all over

156
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:57,641
0.25 karat, sir

157
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,041
526 stones, sir.

158
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:01,081
Cost 20 million, sir.

159
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:02,881
Somehow retrieve it for us, sir.

160
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:03,921
Okay.

161
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,521
He's chief technical officer of BSNL.

162

Ramasubramaniam

163
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:09,562
I heard you're tracking with Sim card.

164
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:12,520
- What happened, sir?
- It isn't our Govt network alone.

165
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,280
All the other networks too
are unable to track even 1 phone, sir.

166
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,680
All the cell phones
have been switched off.

167
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,840
Every single phone in the city is missing.

168
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,920
How can all of them
be switched off?

169
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,399
How is this possible, sir?

170
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:28,040
'Vanakkam Headlines'

171
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,839

you know the situation'

175
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,519
What is this?

176
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:41,878
What is this phenomenon?

177
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:43,318
This is strange

178
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:46,757
I've checked all the NASA studies
and Interpol records.

179
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,557
No one has recorded such an event
anywhere in the world.

180
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:54,158
There is no scientific explanation
so far for this rare occurrence.

181
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:56,717
It is so obvious.

182
00:15:57,437 --> 00:15:58,957
This is a terrorist attack.

183
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:00,957
They are planning something large-scale.

184
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:02,797
If we can't come up with a reason

185
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:06,795
it's our habit to blame
either God or terrorists, right?

186
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:10,397
Can it be the handiwork of aliens
from a different planet maybe?

187
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,437
No, sir.

188
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:13,036
According to ISRO reports

189
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:16,916
no new movements or alien activities
have been recorded in space.

190
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:21,355
Can it be a conspiracy by some
international company in the same field?

191
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,395
I mean, wipe out the present
telephone technology.

192
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:26,395
And bring in a new
scientific know-how.

193
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:27,794
This is a public display.

194
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:31,874
In just 2 days, all the mobiles in the city
flying in mid air like sparrows.

195
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:34,753
There isn't any technology
like this as far as I know.

196
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:40,352
May be someone we know here
who botched up a lousy robot earlier.

197
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:43,473
Some crank scientist

198
00:16:43,513 --> 00:16:47,633
is messing up with some other invention
in the name of novelty, who knows!

199
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:50,794
Who is this?

200
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:53,392
Late Mr Bohra AIRD director.

201
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,513
His son Dhinendra Bohra.

202
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:58,913
Scientist, he's also in AIRD
as senior director.

203
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:04,712
On the day all the cell phones went missing

204
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:07,151
data from INSAT 3D weather satellite.

205
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:10,071
And GSAT 16 communication satellite.

206
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:11,751
This is the visualization.

207
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,030
All these dots are cell phones.

208
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,911
After a certain distance
the dots vanish into thin air.

209
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,429
Cell phones haven't crossed
the troposphere.

210
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,630
That is, not crossed
10 km above sea level.

211
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,029
If you take the distance into account

212
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,630
not crossed a radius
of 200 km beyond Chennai.

213
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:39,150
They are all missing
within this sphere somewhere.

214
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:40,908
We are aware of only 4 forces.

215
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:44,229
Gravity, electromagnetic,
strong nuclear, weak nuclear.

216
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,189
These 4 won't attract mobile force

217
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:49,989
I believe this can be
explained scientifically.

218
00:17:50,348 --> 00:17:51,428
Dot!

219
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:55,708
I believe all the phones in this shop
broke the glass panes and flew out.

220
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:57,748
Where is the lorry
with the consignment?

221
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,788

222
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:01,947
Not yet crossed Andhra border?

223
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:04,746
We've advertised tomorrow's sale.

224
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:07,027
No one has a cell phone in the city.

225
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:11,146
They will make a beeline to our shop
like devotees in the temple at Tirupati.

226
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:13,827
'Don't worry, it will be
delivered at 4:00 a.m'

227
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,947

like a broken record!

Bro, what is that deafening sound?

231
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:51,664
Songs nowadays are only like this!

232
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:58,424
Bro...?!

233
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:12,823
Someone is digging
with a crowbar in our van.

234
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:15,222
We have only cartons
with cell phones in there.

235
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:32,781
Call me, as soon as
the truck reaches here.

236
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:34,460
Have you asked
for police protection?

237
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:36,780
Paid them, the cops will
be here by 5:00 a.m.

238
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:40,979
What if all the cell phones we get
for our sale tomorrow fly away?

239
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,420
It means we are jinxed
beyond redemption.

- Commissioner Rajendran asked me to come.
- Please come in.

253
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:06,324
There is no evidence of human presence
in Jayanth Kumar's murder.

254
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:08,683
As the deceased is a cell phone merchant

255
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:11,124
he wanted you to check for clues.

256
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,444
His family members were on a pilgrimage.

257
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:14,565
He was all alone.

258
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:16,644
The servants are not aware of anything.

259
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,723
No fingerprint or footprint.

260
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:21,563
He died exploding
to minuuute pieces.

261
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:24,284
But there is no evidence
of explosives whatsoever.

262
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:38,521
He had advertised in the papers
about his Mobile Sale in his shop.

The truck carrying the load
met with an accident.

264
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:43,242
The entire load went missing.

265
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,402

the presence of cell phones here.

all the cell phones disappearing here.

in my old phone and I've activated it.

00:31:35,588 --> 00:31:39,029
We can't explain this force based
on our knowledge of science.

350
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,388
Using the amenities at our disposal

351
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:43,109
we can't combat it either.

352
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:45,629
That's why we've requested
our military to step in.

353
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:47,590
Sir, it's a huge force

354
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,950
I saw it with my own eyes.

355
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,950
If you ask the military
to combat it

356
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,831
you will only face
enormous loss of life.

357
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,511
What should we do then?

358
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:58,032
To combat it effectively
we need a super power.

359
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:01,233
We need exceptional intelligence.

360
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:05,393
We need a man with
the boon of immortality.

361
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:06,914
A man who will never die?

362
00:32:07,835 --> 00:32:09,475
Does a person like that exist?

363
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:11,515
Chitti.

364
00:32:11,636 --> 00:32:12,715
The Robot!

365
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,157
We must reactivate him.

366
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:21,197
Dot...!

367
00:32:22,477 --> 00:32:23,878
I'm waiting.

368
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:25,919
No... impossible.

369
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,639
It's against law, sir.

370
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:30,600
Our court has banned that robot.

371
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,200
Has been dismantled too.

372
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:35,360
It went out of control
and killed many lives.

373
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:37,321
Immense loss of property as well.

374
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,600
You are all well aware

375
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:40,402
if we bring it back

376
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:41,881
it won't die.

377
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:44,282
It will massacre all of us.

378
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:49,483
Everyone is aware who was responsible
for that robot's drastic change.

379
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:53,084
This time I'll ensure
such a blunder does not occur.

380
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:56,125
Sir, this is Mr Vaseegaran's conspiracy.

381
00:32:56,805 --> 00:33:00,645
He wants to use this critical situation
and reactivate his invention.

382
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,366
He wants to make money by
selling it to multinational companies.

383
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:04,726
Now you decide.

384
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:07,407
Have we assembled here
to save the people?

385
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,289
Or for Vaseegaran's advertising?

386
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:11,968
Okay, so you come up with a solution.

387
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:15,528
Let's... think about it.

388
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,009
That's why we are here.

389
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:22,731
Sir, my suggestion is based
purely on good intentions.

390
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,410
This is the start
of an apocalypse.

391
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:28,851
If we don't prevent it now, we'll be wiped
out en masse, only Chitti can save us.

392
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,491
Mr Vaseegaran.

393
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:33,452
We can't flout a court order blatantly.

394
00:33:34,332 --> 00:33:36,734
The process required
to do so is very tedious

395
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:39,055
I must pass an ordinance
in the Parliament.

396
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:42,575
Opposition parties should cooperate.

397
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,616
- Not possible.
- It is possible, sir.

398
00:33:44,735 --> 00:33:47,496
A minister can easily take
some emergency decisions.

399
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:50,216
We can convince the court
by explaining in detail later.

400
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:51,176
Such a rule exists.

401
00:33:51,177 --> 00:33:53,177
But if that robot kills some people?

402
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,177
Who will take the responsibility?

403
00:33:55,257 --> 00:33:56,258
Should I?

404
00:33:56,298 --> 00:33:57,657
Or our minister?

405
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:01,738
- Such a situation won't arise, sir.
- Why not?

406
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:03,980
That's a machine.

407
00:34:04,338 --> 00:34:06,379
We can't predict
when it may screw up.

408
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:09,660
If it does something drastic
I'll be held responsible.

409
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:12,941
Let's forget Chitti.

410
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:14,781
Suggest some other option.

411
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:18,102
Military is the only other feasible option.

412
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,742
Let's go ahead with that.

413
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:22,944
Request and the order
will be released by today.

414
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:24,304
Do the needful.

415
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,026
Hello...?

416
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:36,986
So.

417
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:38,627
Plan collapsed?

418
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:40,427
Dhina, what is all this?

419
00:34:40,707 --> 00:34:42,667
You are a scientist
You are well aware.

420
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:43,707
Of course.

421
00:34:44,108 --> 00:34:45,507
But I won't let it happen

422
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:49,670
I'll never allow you to bring
that nitwit Chitti back to life.

423
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:52,030
What do you have against me?

424
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,350
You murdered my dad.

425
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,551
Me...?

426
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,191
That Chitti.

427
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,070
Your alter ego.

428
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:00,830
That is also you!

429
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:06,473

440
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:47,813
Hack it open, Nila.

441
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:50,933
Boss, according to my rules
hacking is illegal.

442
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:52,494
Isn't this wrong?

443
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:55,854
This will come under ethical hacking

arrangements have been made
to restart sales of cell phones.

using their cell phones as usual.

467

Call the minister and ask him
to provide us military protection.

We have 4 police vans
round the clock stationed here, sir.

Looking at the current situation
looks like I'll be the next juice!

00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,333
Today.

527
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:57,412
Right now.

528
00:47:57,812 --> 00:48:01,653
How can you ask as if you're ordering
'idli' and 'vada' as Take away?

529
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,853
It is a ban by the court, sir

530
00:48:04,892 --> 00:48:06,692
I can't flout the rules of the court

531
00:48:06,853 --> 00:48:08,371
I'll handle all those formalities

532
00:48:08,372 --> 00:48:09,732
1st activate Chitti at once.

533
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:11,412
How is it possible immediately?

534
00:48:11,452 --> 00:48:13,572
An ordinance has to be
passed in the Parliament.

535
00:48:13,612 --> 00:48:15,293
'The Opposition has to cooperate'

536
00:48:15,332 --> 00:48:17,771
The process is extremely complicated, sir

537
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:20,131
40 members of the Parliament
will favor us, sir

538
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:21,372
I'll handle all that.

539
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:22,891
It's a machine, sir.

540
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:24,931
We don't know when it will malfunction.

541
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:29,251
Who will shoulder the responsibility
if it kills someone? You or me?

542
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:33,171
Yov! Don't seek revenge
oblivious of time or situation.

543
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:35,690
It went into our Telecom minister's mouth.

544
00:48:35,691 --> 00:48:37,731
God knows which part of me it will target

545
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:40,027
I'll take all the responsibility.

546
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,131
Satisfied?

547
00:48:44,451 --> 00:48:45,251
Dot!

548
00:48:45,252 --> 00:48:49,050
I came here at midnight
There was a queue right then

549
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:52,328
I haven't got the phone as yet
and she wants me to top up!

550
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,090
Without cell phones, our life is like
'A Few Pages Missing In The Middle'

551
00:48:56,449 --> 00:48:59,290
Okay, what if the cell phones
fly away again?

552
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,771
I'm as sharp as a needle, you see.

553
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:04,210
Take a look.

554
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:07,490
You've fixed it like the chained tumbler
in the railway station!

555
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:10,728
Sir, for a while I was
so relaxed without cell phones.

556
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:13,970
No ringtones to bug me daily
I'm lifting my head to see the world

557
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:16,570
I talk to my children
I visit my friends face to face.

558
00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:19,129
- Great feeling, eh?
- Then why the hell is he here?

559
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:21,650
What to do?
A cell phone is like one's wife.

560
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,889
Damn if she exists
Darn if she doesn't!

561
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:25,049
Become a habit!

562
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:29,049
Yes!

563
00:51:16,846 --> 00:51:18,486
Chitti, you're back?

564
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:20,966
The way I fell I thought
my skull will blow to bits.

565
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,405
Thank you, Chitti.

566
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:43,565
Holy crow!

567
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:36,403
Chitti to Control.

568
00:52:36,443 --> 00:52:39,483
- 'Control to Chitti'
- Assemble at TTK road junction.

569
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:27,555
What is this?

570
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,835
Integral space research centre.

571
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:33,235
That space research
centre isn't active now.

572
00:56:33,675 --> 00:56:35,435
Research is no longer
conducted there.

573
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,395
Only 2 technicians are left.

574
00:56:37,515 --> 00:56:42,155
In 1964, head of Atomic Commission
Dr Homi Baba inaugurated this centre.

575
00:56:43,714 --> 00:56:45,035
Call Dr Sam.

576
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:50,235
Hello, Sam here.

577
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:51,755
Dr Sam, I'm Vasi

578
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:53,915
I need this information now, urgent.

579
00:56:53,954 --> 00:56:57,915
What is that space research centre
in sector II Phase XIV?

580
00:56:57,955 --> 00:57:00,913
Vasi, keep this confidential.

581
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:06,753
To find out if life exists
in other planets just like us on earth

582
00:57:06,954 --> 00:57:12,154
signals are sent from many parts
of the world to outer space.

583
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:15,273
That is one such place
from where signals are sent.

584
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:16,914
What kind of signals are being sent?

585
00:57:16,954 --> 00:57:21,674
There are good forces and bad forces
co existing in this world.

586
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:26,673
We send only positive signals
to outer space.

587
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:31,832
Because only positive energy
present in space

588
00:57:31,872 --> 00:57:34,633
should be aware
of our presence here.

589
00:57:34,832 --> 00:57:35,873
Thank you very much, Sam.

590
00:57:35,913 --> 00:57:38,513
Chitti, play that visual
in Kirlian mode.

591
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:43,433
Look at that.

592
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:46,913
If that cell phone bird is scared
of the positive signals from the emitters

593
00:57:46,992 --> 00:57:50,112
there is some negative force
embedded in it.

594
00:57:51,192 --> 00:57:54,192
By negative force
you mean from another planet?

595
00:57:57,192 --> 00:57:58,432
Freeze it.

596
00:58:01,072 --> 00:58:04,871
No, this is some negative force
present only on our earth.

597
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:12,552
This is a human face.

598
00:58:13,191 --> 00:58:14,712
It looks very familiar to me.

599
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:18,750
Nila, I want all the recent
abnormal events in Thirukazhukundram.

600
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:21,272
Most importantly
details of the deceased a.s.a.p.

601
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,671
Doctor, this resembles the emitter
we saw in that space research centre.

602
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,072
Exactly - What is your plan?

603
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:32,430
You know by now You tell me.

604
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:36,151
If it is a human negative energy
that is creating the 'mobile' force

605
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:37,790
it has no physical form.

606
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:40,471
But only the aura
that surrounds the human body.

607
00:58:40,591 --> 00:58:41,471
Aura...?

608
00:58:41,511 --> 00:58:45,431
Atoms in a human body
consist of neutrons and electrons.

609
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:50,950
The micro photon particles
that emanate from it is called aura.

610
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,389
It is a thin layer around the body
not visible to the human eye.

611
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:57,388
Aura of a person who is alive
is charged positive.

612
00:58:57,389 --> 00:58:59,750
A dead person's aura
will be charged negative.

613
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,710
We must destroy that negative charge.

614
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,390
The only way to succeed is to send
a more powerful positive charge towards it.

615
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,828
And neutralize its energy.

616
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:11,429
Aura of a deceased person
is micro photon minus.

617
00:59:11,709 --> 00:59:14,070
We must send micro photon plus.

618
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:16,510
Add plus to minus
it becomes zero.

619
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,149
- Am I right, doctor?
- Exactly, Chitti.

620
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:23,068
This photon synthesizer
generates micro photon plus.

621
00:59:23,069 --> 00:59:24,069
See

622
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:29,869
I've created the same positive rays here
similar to the Research centre.

623
00:59:29,908 --> 00:59:34,189
This is 10 times stronger than
any negative energy known to mankind.

624
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:37,068
We can neutralize
the negative energy for sure.

625
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,988
Wow! Great.

626
00:59:38,028 --> 00:59:40,429
Boss, here are the details you asked for

627
00:59:41,348 --> 00:59:45,869
73 people died last year
in Thirukazhukundram.

628
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:47,548
Only 18 unnatural death

629
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:49,548
2 murders 4 suicides.

630
00:59:49,588 --> 00:59:51,988
Is any death connected to a cell phone?

631
00:59:52,988 --> 00:59:57,029
A lorry driver died in an accident
using his mobile while driving.

632
00:59:57,308 --> 00:59:59,868
Because her 'hot' photos
went viral through her mobile

633
00:59:59,908 --> 01:00:01,388
a girl consumed poison.

634
01:00:01,668 --> 01:00:05,027
One man died hanging himself
in a cell phone tower.

635
01:00:05,547 --> 01:00:07,028
- Date?
- April 7th.

636
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,788
The next day cell phones started vanishing.

637
01:00:11,828 --> 01:00:13,027
Oh my God!

638
01:00:13,508 --> 01:00:15,227
Now I'm getting a clearer picture.

639
01:00:15,427 --> 01:00:17,907
Chitti, immediately
install this in AIRD bus.

640
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,867
We are leaving for Thirukazhukundram.

641
01:01:43,945 --> 01:01:45,224
Doctor, we got it

642
01:01:45,424 --> 01:01:46,785
I found all the phones.

643
01:01:46,825 --> 01:01:49,544
Nila, bring the bus
to the rear end of the house.

644
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:53,862
CHITTI!

645
01:04:18,499 --> 01:04:20,259
Nila, fix the cryostat, quick!

646
01:05:21,499 --> 01:05:22,979
My God!

647
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,540
Pakshi Raja...!

648
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,902
Nice DP.

649
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:41,746
This is a war between
the entire mankind and me.

650
01:05:42,507 --> 01:05:44,388
You are not a human being.

651
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,269
Don't interfere.

652
01:05:46,828 --> 01:05:49,470
- Run away.
- Running away isn't in my software at all

653
01:05:49,551 --> 01:05:52,151
I have been reactivated
only to protect human beings.

654
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:54,231
My primary task is to destroy you!

655
01:06:02,795 --> 01:06:06,155
Pakshi Raja, why are you
so furious with the human race?

656
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:21,161
Why are you behaving like this?

657
01:06:21,642 --> 01:06:23,123
What do you need?

658
01:07:23,945 --> 01:07:25,986
This is a pied cuckoo.

659
01:07:26,905 --> 01:07:29,867
Biological name is Jacobin cuckoo.

660
01:07:31,227 --> 01:07:32,627
In Northern India...

661
01:07:32,747 --> 01:07:37,230
the monsoon season starts
only when this species migrates.

662
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:39,951
If this species doesn't show up...

663
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:43,192
there will be no rainfall
in that year for the entire region.

664
01:07:43,952 --> 01:07:47,113
Till date no one knows
the mystery behind this.

665
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:51,475
Even in our mythology
it is referred as 'rain bird'

666
01:07:52,555 --> 01:07:54,555
Carry out research on this.

667
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:55,757
Sure, sir.

668
01:07:55,836 --> 01:07:56,717
Wow...!

669
01:07:56,756 --> 01:07:59,199
Sir, your photo is
on the cover page.

670
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:02,119
It was published a year ago.

671
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,241
Sir, how did you get
interested in birds?

672
01:08:07,161 --> 01:08:10,763
Actually the other way about
The birds evinced interest in me!

673
01:08:12,002 --> 01:08:14,723
'When I was born
I wasn't breathing'

674
01:08:14,844 --> 01:08:17,245
'My body had turned blue'

675
01:08:17,325 --> 01:08:19,965
'Even the doctor gave up hope
and said the baby is dead'

676
01:08:20,006 --> 01:08:21,967
I'll sign and you finish
all the formalities.

677
01:08:22,006 --> 01:08:24,247
Get the death certificate
and take the baby.

678
01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:14,586
'Don't know if it was an accident
or something else'

679
01:09:14,627 --> 01:09:17,387
'But everyone exclaimed
it was a huge miracle'

680
01:09:18,107 --> 01:09:19,548
'My grandma used to say'

681
01:09:20,028 --> 01:09:24,150
'God came in the guise of
a sparrow and resurrected you'

682
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:27,272
'I still remember'

683
01:09:27,711 --> 01:09:31,633
'When I was young, early in the morning
the tiny sparrow will fly into my room'

684
01:09:31,673 --> 01:09:35,715
'...keep chirping cheerfully
and going around the fan in a circle'

685
01:09:37,755 --> 01:09:43,997
"To the sun's ray at dawn that glitter
a warm welcome your wings you flutter."

686
01:09:44,037 --> 01:09:50,119
"As the sun slides down yonder deep
you caress the branches to sleep."

687
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:56,203
"With your pitter patter dainty feet
'kolam' you draw as an aesthetic treat."

688
01:09:56,323 --> 01:10:02,524
"Today you make me yearn
To fly like you I want to learn."

689
01:10:02,604 --> 01:10:05,806
"Flock of birds in flight"

690
01:10:05,886 --> 01:10:08,727
"I stood listening
to your musical chirping"

691
01:10:08,807 --> 01:10:10,648
'I decided right then'

692
01:10:10,688 --> 01:10:14,008
'My life will be dedicated
to birds and only birds'

693
01:10:41,138 --> 01:10:43,460
"Flock of birds in flight."

694
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,981
"Oho! A flight of birds in sight."

695
01:10:46,781 --> 01:10:52,303
"I stood listening
to your musical chirping."

696
01:10:53,704 --> 01:10:58,826
"A host of sparrows
A flight of swallows"

697
01:10:59,066 --> 01:11:05,388
"I wish to hear
your tweet and twitter."

698
01:11:20,554 --> 01:11:26,076
"No language or religion, you fly at ease
Any place is your home, as you please."

699
01:11:26,795 --> 01:11:32,119
"No language, no religion, you roam
You affirm any place is your home."

700
01:11:32,717 --> 01:11:38,961
"You claim even weeds to be
your kith and kin in reality."

701
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:45,122
"You form a swing in mid-air
to play with the wind out there."

702
01:11:45,163 --> 01:11:50,325
"You make a deep impact in people
to whom laughter isn't easy or simple."

703
01:11:50,405 --> 01:11:56,087
"My precious life, my cherished creed
A heart like yours is needed indeed."

704
01:11:58,087 --> 01:12:03,490
"Even if the world is wiped out extensively
an urge to protect you surges effusively."

705
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:06,051
"Swiftly on a flying spree
in the skies carefree."

706
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:09,051
"Fly without any boundary."

707
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:13,493
That's why I studied
ornithology with passion

708
01:12:13,853 --> 01:12:16,415
I became an ornithology professor too.

709
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,057
'Pon ulagaaleero'

710
01:12:21,576 --> 01:12:23,497
'Bhuvanam muzhudhaleero'

711
01:12:23,736 --> 01:12:25,778
'Nannaya pullinangaal'

712
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:29,379
These are lines from
Nammazhwar's Thiruvaimozhi.

713
01:12:29,539 --> 01:12:31,060
This is the meaning.

714
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,061
O' birds, you are all over this world.

715
01:12:34,461 --> 01:12:36,902
You have spread your wings
right up to Heaven.

716
01:12:37,262 --> 01:12:40,024
Our earth and our skies
abound in these birds.

717
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:43,344
When compared to the weight
of the human race on earth...

718
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:46,386
weight of the birds en masse
is almost 100 times more.

719
01:12:46,466 --> 01:12:50,907
Birds eat 1000 times more food
than what humans consume.

720
01:12:52,108 --> 01:12:54,549
If they didn't feed on worms

721
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:57,230
not even 1 green leaf
will be left on earth.

722
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:00,311
Human beings won't
get any food at all.

723
01:13:00,591 --> 01:13:04,833
Because insects are
1000 times more than birds!

724
01:13:05,993 --> 01:13:08,714
So if human beings have to
survive on this earth...

725
01:13:08,794 --> 01:13:12,355
birds also should be alive.

726
01:13:12,395 --> 01:13:15,396
Sir, of late birds flocking to
the bird sanctuary in Vedanthangal

727
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:17,638
has dwindled
What is the reason, sir?

728
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:21,839
When I was young, we used to wake up
only to the chirp of sparrows.

729
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:24,920
'You don't get to see any sparrow
in the city nowadays, sir'

730
01:13:30,002 --> 01:13:32,363
'Only in 1996...'

731
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:35,325
'...cell phones were
introduced in India'

732
01:13:35,404 --> 01:13:39,324
'In a gradual and continuous process
birds have decreased only after this'

733
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:42,447
'Particularly sparrows'

734
01:13:43,407 --> 01:13:44,968
It is called Arctic Tern.

735
01:13:45,127 --> 01:13:48,809
This small bird weighing just 50 gm

736
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,531
migrates every year
from the Arctic region

737
01:13:52,651 --> 01:13:56,812
flying 12000 km
to our Vedanthangal

738
01:13:56,892 --> 01:13:57,933
and returns.

739
01:13:58,053 --> 01:14:00,333
A bird doesn't have a map or radar.

740
01:14:00,373 --> 01:14:04,815
From within its head, it absorbs
all micro rays from the sky.

741
01:14:04,855 --> 01:14:08,176
And using cryptochrome formation

742
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:10,657
it steers in the right direction.

743
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:12,818
'That is the bird's sole strength'

744
01:14:13,218 --> 01:14:18,860
Now we've filled the sky with radiation
from numerous cell phone towers.

745
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:23,343
So the cryptochrome formation
in the bird's head is shattered.

746
01:14:23,382 --> 01:14:25,463
And eliminated completely.

747
01:14:25,623 --> 01:14:27,504
'Not knowing where they are heading'

748
01:14:27,584 --> 01:14:30,825
'...birds lose their way and
their entire species is becoming extinct'

749
01:14:30,865 --> 01:14:33,346
'To the birds, it is equal
to losing their sanity'

750
01:14:33,626 --> 01:14:36,347
In addition, because of the radiation...

751
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:39,229
shells aren't being formed
on the eggs of these birds.

752
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,389
Their eggs resemble a layer of skin.

753
01:14:41,469 --> 01:14:45,151
The eggs break when
the mother bird is incubating.

754
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:49,273
In reality, men also suffer
from these repercussions.

755
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:52,233
Many get afflicted by ♪♪♪♪♪♪

756
01:14:52,633 --> 01:14:54,434
♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪ May be on the rise

757
01:14:54,514 --> 01:14:56,035
♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪ will increase

758
01:14:56,274 --> 01:14:57,355
Above all.

759
01:14:57,475 --> 01:14:58,395
Depression.

760
01:14:58,435 --> 01:14:59,557
Schizophrenia.

761
01:14:59,636 --> 01:15:01,276
Alzheimer's etc-

762
01:15:04,157 --> 01:15:06,078
Higher % of mental disorder.

763
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:09,840
All these symptoms
are obvious right now.

764
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,720
Mr Pakshi Rajan.

765
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,681
What is your solution?

766
01:15:14,202 --> 01:15:16,321
Why do we use cell phone now?

767
01:15:17,123 --> 01:15:18,723
Just gossip and trivialities.

768
01:15:18,803 --> 01:15:20,323
Let's control that.

769
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:23,204
Why do we need so many
cell phones and towers?

770
01:15:23,284 --> 01:15:24,565
Let us reduce that.

771
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:29,608
Let us pass a law as to who, why and
for how long a cell phone can be used.

772
01:15:30,008 --> 01:15:31,967
Has this chap lost it?
Is he mad?

773
01:15:32,048 --> 01:15:34,969
Instead of the current high frequency
cell phone technology

774
01:15:35,008 --> 01:15:37,169
let us invent
a safer technology.

775
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:41,411
Until then let us shut down
90% of the cell phone towers in India.

776
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:45,373
Please speak a little loudly.

777
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:46,895
Sir, please excuse me.

778
01:15:53,135 --> 01:15:55,137
'Save bird, save earth'

779
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,937
'Save bird Save earth'

780
01:15:56,977 --> 01:15:58,818
'Don't kill, don't kill'

781
01:15:58,857 --> 01:16:00,418
'Don't kill birds'

782
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:02,019
'Save birds save birds'

783
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:03,740
'Save birds Save earth'

784
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:05,300
'Don't kill, don't kill'

785
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,901
'Don't kill birds'

786
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:08,181
'Stop... stop'

787
01:16:08,221 --> 01:16:09,702
'Radiation Pollution'

788
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:11,183
'Stop... stop'

789
01:16:11,222 --> 01:16:12,944
'Radiation Pollution'

790
01:16:13,143 --> 01:16:15,464
'Don't kill'

791
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:17,984
Are they all jobless?

792
01:16:18,385 --> 01:16:22,787
When the sun rises, they swing placards
defending dogs, cats, crows and sparrows.

793
01:16:22,947 --> 01:16:24,348
Can't you chase them?

794
01:16:24,387 --> 01:16:27,229
'Refusing to leave, sir
Very insistent about meeting you'

795
01:16:33,351 --> 01:16:34,391
Tell me.

796
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:36,833
What's your problem?

797
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,794
What is the frequency rate
permitted by TRAI?

798
01:16:41,595 --> 01:16:44,555
What is the frequency rate
in your towers at present?

799
01:16:45,156 --> 01:16:48,317
Birds flying in the sky are being
destroyed in their fetus stage by you.

800
01:16:48,357 --> 01:16:49,756
Hello mister, listen.

801
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:53,159
We strictly follow the rules of
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.

802
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,599
Already subscribers complain.

803
01:16:54,679 --> 01:16:58,440
'No signal in the bathroom or basement
Skype doesn't work in the lift'

804
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,161
Do you know in these 3 months
2000 customers have...

805
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,522
switched to other networks?

806
01:17:02,562 --> 01:17:03,682
Don't lie.

807
01:17:04,123 --> 01:17:08,245
In your disgusting competition
just to retain your subscribers

808
01:17:08,284 --> 01:17:11,886
you are increasing the frequency rate
to suit your needs as you wish.

809
01:17:11,926 --> 01:17:14,767
Now it is well over the danger limit.

810
01:17:15,126 --> 01:17:18,168
Because of the heavy radiation
the entire species of birds

811
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,610
the bird kingdom is dying
without a trace.

812
01:17:20,729 --> 01:17:22,369
You aren't one bit bothered.

813
01:17:22,409 --> 01:17:24,009
You are exaggerating.

814
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:27,332
Birds becoming extinct
due to cell phone radiation

815
01:17:27,371 --> 01:17:29,171
has no scientific proof or backing.

816
01:17:29,373 --> 01:17:30,293
You know that?

817
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:32,012
If that is so come with me.

818
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:37,494
Stand under your cell phone tower
for just 24 hours

819
01:17:37,535 --> 01:17:39,056
I will prove it!

820
01:17:39,816 --> 01:17:40,816
You get out.

821
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:43,097
You asked for scientific proof, right?

822
01:17:43,457 --> 01:17:44,658
I'll provide it.

823
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:45,778
Get out, man.

824
01:17:45,818 --> 01:17:47,458
Write to the Press & Media.

825
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,420
Hold placards and
protest in the hot sun

826
01:17:49,459 --> 01:17:50,781
I don't care.

827
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:51,940
Out.

828
01:17:52,021 --> 01:17:53,261
Get out!

829
01:17:56,902 --> 01:17:58,263
Nonsense!

830
01:18:05,146 --> 01:18:07,666
Move it a little bit upwards.

831
01:18:12,428 --> 01:18:14,028
Hey... listen!

832
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:15,990
What is this, sir?

833
01:18:16,469 --> 01:18:17,710
Stop it

834
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:19,230
I'm telling you.

835
01:18:19,271 --> 01:18:22,032
There are houses nearby
Many birds flock around.

836
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:23,871
Stop everything - Hey, old man.

837
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:26,874
Are we building a nuclear plant here?
It's only a cell phone tower.

838
01:18:26,914 --> 01:18:30,034
Hereafter you'll get good signal
on your phone, move aside.

839
01:18:30,075 --> 01:18:31,275
Come on... come.

840
01:18:31,355 --> 01:18:33,155
- What is it, sir?
- Ramasamy

841
01:18:33,235 --> 01:18:35,877
I repeatedly told you
about birds dying.

842
01:18:35,996 --> 01:18:37,438
You were also worried.

843
01:18:37,517 --> 01:18:39,638
- But now...?
- What can I do, sir?

844
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:41,279
Agriculture is no longer profitable.

845
01:18:41,318 --> 01:18:42,799
Insects kill all my yield

846
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,759
I became a pauper
buying insecticides.

847
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,962
Primary reason for that is
the increased death rate of birds.

848
01:18:48,242 --> 01:18:50,123
Only birds eat insects.

849
01:18:50,323 --> 01:18:51,843
If birds die...

850
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:54,004
insects will increase
beyond control.

851
01:18:54,283 --> 01:18:57,085
Whatever the reason, I don't
have the strength to be a farmer.

852
01:18:57,164 --> 01:18:59,606
This is the only income
I can get from this land.

853
01:18:59,927 --> 01:19:03,006
Why should you sell your land
to a man who kills birds?

854
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:05,409
People are dying
of starvation here.

855
01:19:05,488 --> 01:19:07,408
And you're bothered
about birds dying!

856
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:09,330
Don't pester me
Attend to your work.

857
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,890
Move aside.

858
01:19:13,411 --> 01:19:14,972
'Ladies and gentlemen'

859
01:19:15,612 --> 01:19:17,652
'Stop using cell phone'

860
01:19:18,493 --> 01:19:23,094
Every cell phone used is encased
with the blood of thousands of birds.

861
01:19:23,536 --> 01:19:27,135
Each cell phone is a sparrow's coffin!

862
01:19:27,217 --> 01:19:28,697
Save birds.

863
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:31,137
Come here - Yes, sir.

864
01:19:31,178 --> 01:19:33,818
Who is this man?
Disturbing all our customers.

865
01:19:33,819 --> 01:19:35,539
Chase him away - Okay, sir.

866
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,380
What happened?

867
01:19:38,499 --> 01:19:40,661
Ladies and gentlemen.

868
01:19:40,741 --> 01:19:42,902
Don't use cell phones.

869
01:19:43,462 --> 01:19:44,703
Here... read this.

870
01:20:19,955 --> 01:20:21,397
Aiyaiyo!

871
01:21:08,499 --> 01:21:11,179
I have given many petitions
in many levels many times.

872
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:14,020
'No one has taken any action'

873
01:21:15,379 --> 01:21:16,538
Oh!

874
01:21:16,699 --> 01:21:20,099
Is this why we don't see
any sparrows at all?

875
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,140
When I was a kid

876
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,701
they used to flock around my house.

877
01:21:26,741 --> 01:21:28,741
It was a feast for sore eyes

878
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:30,381
I've played with those birds.

879
01:21:30,461 --> 01:21:33,421
When I grew up, I have
even fried and feasted on them.

880
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:35,660
A real treat for the taste buds.

881
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,341
- Crispy, like quail fry.
- Super, sir.

882
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:41,182
And that concoction made with it.

883
01:21:41,341 --> 01:21:43,063
What an aphrodisiac!

884
01:21:48,142 --> 01:21:49,702
It isn't available nowadays.

885
01:21:49,743 --> 01:21:50,823
What is this?

886
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:54,503
I'm talking of ensuring birds live
and you're relishing killing them.

887
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:56,103
What else do you want me to do?

888
01:21:56,183 --> 01:21:58,303
Shall we start a Sparrow Welfare Board?

889
01:21:58,383 --> 01:22:00,183
You can be elected as the chairman

890
01:22:02,024 --> 01:22:07,065
1st take strict action against networks
which exceed their allotted frequency.

891
01:22:08,464 --> 01:22:10,625
Cancel their license.

892
01:22:11,103 --> 01:22:12,265
Then?

893
01:22:12,825 --> 01:22:17,025
Grant permission only 2 networks
following regulations to the T.

894
01:22:17,345 --> 01:22:19,065
What are you saying?

895
01:22:19,145 --> 01:22:21,185
We boast of a population of 1.3 billion.

896
01:22:21,265 --> 01:22:22,825
Shouldn't we reach all of them?

897
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:24,705
Shouldn't every area receive signal?

898
01:22:24,786 --> 01:22:27,107
Cell phone is the
foundation for everything.

899
01:22:27,227 --> 01:22:30,426
The world will come to a standstill
if mobiles don't work for an hour.

900
01:22:30,465 --> 01:22:32,746
How much time is saved
because of this gadget?

901
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,106
Business has developed
Industries have prospered.

902
01:22:35,147 --> 01:22:38,267
Because he's hungry will anyone
chop his own hand and eat it?

903
01:22:39,547 --> 01:22:42,947
Same holds good for the progress
we attain by killing birds.

904
01:22:44,388 --> 01:22:47,707
If a 30 gm sparrow can't live
depending on us

905
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:50,709
…then how can we boast of
this technology and progress?

906
01:22:51,909 --> 01:22:54,468
America is a bigger nation than India.

907
01:22:54,549 --> 01:22:56,990
It has only 4-5 networks

908
01:22:57,269 --> 01:23:00,269
China is the most populated
country in the world.

909
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:02,669
Only 3 networks are used.

910
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:03,909
But here?

911
01:23:03,989 --> 01:23:05,390
More than 10.

912
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:07,630
You accept ♪♪♪♪♪♪ from everyone

913
01:23:07,669 --> 01:23:10,390
And allow networks to flourish
flouting all the rules.

914
01:23:11,031 --> 01:23:12,911
You're letting your tongue run, eh?

915
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,351
You seem educated

916
01:23:14,431 --> 01:23:17,751
I was lenient because you're a big shot
You're analysing politics, huh?

917
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:19,231
Okay, let me counteract.

918
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,150
We work based only
on rules and regulations.

919
01:23:22,792 --> 01:23:27,232
Only by adhering to international rules
cell phone service is allotted.

920
01:23:27,632 --> 01:23:29,751
File a case in court
if you have any doubts.

921
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:30,752
Clear out now.

922
01:23:30,753 --> 01:23:32,554
Don't get angry
Please listen to me

923
01:23:32,593 --> 01:23:34,992
I was patient for so long, eh?
Go... go to court.

924
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:37,194
You'll get a verdict after many years.

925
01:23:37,233 --> 01:23:39,193
Prime minister says
I must meet the common man.

926
01:23:39,234 --> 01:23:41,553
'And I get caught
with such crackpots'

927
01:23:55,074 --> 01:23:58,234
Court officials are coming
to check radiation frequency.

928
01:23:58,235 --> 01:24:00,155
Make sure it is well within the limit.

929
01:24:00,195 --> 01:24:02,755
'From multiples tests conducted
it has been found...'

930
01:24:02,795 --> 01:24:06,156
'...only adequate radiation
has been channelized into cell phones'

931
01:24:06,195 --> 01:24:12,756
'It has not been proved scientifically
that birds are affected by cell phones'

932
01:24:13,436 --> 01:24:17,477
'Therefore Pakshi Rajan's case
has been adjourned'

933
01:26:23,729 --> 01:26:26,688
Pakshi Rajan, whatever you say
is just and right.

934
01:26:26,768 --> 01:26:28,689
But killing humans is wrong.

935
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:31,890
They killed countless flocks of birds
Isn't that a crime?

936
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:35,570
You'll label human life differently.

937
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:37,930
In what way are birds' lives inferior?

938
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:41,210
Why do you kill innocent people
for the fault of a handful of men?

939
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:43,050
Who is 'innocent'?

940
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:47,371
Every individual who owns
a cell phone is a murderer.

941
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:49,331
How I yelled my throat hoarse.

942
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:52,212
How many streets
I would've walked begging.

943
01:26:52,252 --> 01:26:55,133
How many feet I fell
pleading not to use cell phones.

944
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:57,812
Did even a single soul
pay heed to my pleas?

945
01:26:59,252 --> 01:27:01,051
They read about this in newspapers.

946
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:02,453
Watch the News on TV.

947
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:03,653
And then...

948
01:27:03,733 --> 01:27:04,733
exclaim 'oh'!

949
01:27:06,573 --> 01:27:09,814
Do sparrows die only due to
radiation from cell phones?

950
01:27:10,214 --> 01:27:11,533
'How sad!'

951
01:27:12,613 --> 01:27:13,853
'Poor things, no?'

952
01:27:14,213 --> 01:27:16,334
Just for 5 minutes
make clucking sounds.

953
01:27:16,374 --> 01:27:19,534
Share that article and video clipping
in WhatsApp and Facebook.

954
01:27:19,573 --> 01:27:22,453
Thinking their duty is over and
it was their good deed for the day.

955
01:27:22,535 --> 01:27:25,375
They go back to
their cell phones, blockheads!

956
01:27:27,815 --> 01:27:29,415
I won't let this go.

957
01:27:30,175 --> 01:27:33,256
I won't spare even a single person
who owns a cell phone.

958
01:27:34,655 --> 01:27:35,775
Hereafter.

959
01:27:36,735 --> 01:27:39,216
Cell phone is everyone's Yama!

960
01:27:41,016 --> 01:27:44,296
Just watch, people should panic and
run for their lives as soon as they see it.

961
01:27:44,377 --> 01:27:47,136
Pakshi, you've reached your stop.

962
01:27:47,577 --> 01:27:49,257
Get into the bus.

963
01:28:57,584 --> 01:28:58,784
Chitti!

964
01:29:57,469 --> 01:29:58,550
Oh my God!

965
01:31:54,961 --> 01:31:56,800
Thanks - Welcome.

966
01:32:00,361 --> 01:32:02,281
Hey! What is this?

967
01:32:02,602 --> 01:32:05,121
You've fixed your MPU in me.

968
01:32:05,362 --> 01:32:07,081
Oh! By mistake

969
01:32:07,163 --> 01:32:10,002
I was wondering why
my core memory was corrupt.

970
01:32:10,003 --> 01:32:11,521
Punch dialogs Vadivelu comedy.

971
01:32:11,522 --> 01:32:13,441
'Vani Rani' episodes
Banana flower fritters!

972
01:32:13,442 --> 01:32:15,723
#star-darling and dance-king
All kinds of stuff.

973
01:32:15,803 --> 01:32:17,683
Come, lie down I will fix it.

974
01:32:17,723 --> 01:32:18,842
No need.

975
01:32:18,882 --> 01:32:20,123
Let it be.

976
01:32:26,644 --> 01:32:27,724
Aura.

977
01:32:27,763 --> 01:32:30,764
Every human, beast,
inanimate object.

978
01:32:30,844 --> 01:32:32,925
Even every place has an aura.

979
01:32:33,085 --> 01:32:36,804
This aura invisible to the eye pertains
not only to spirituality but science too.

980
01:32:36,845 --> 01:32:39,883
With the help of a Kirlian camera
we can take photos of an aura.

981
01:32:39,884 --> 01:32:42,685
Ordinary people have an aura
3 to 4 feet thick.

982
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:46,325
Some sages have an aura
spreading over 50 feet

983
01:32:46,365 --> 01:32:49,565
Russian scientist
Dr Frank Baranowski has proved this.

984
01:32:50,327 --> 01:32:52,326
Pakshi Rajan's aura is enormous.

985
01:32:52,566 --> 01:32:55,007
It isn't the aura of
an individual man alone.

986
01:32:55,046 --> 01:32:57,567
Aura of 1000s of birds
which were destroyed.

987
01:32:57,926 --> 01:32:59,486
A giant ball of negative energy.

988
01:32:59,487 --> 01:33:00,527
With a mind.

989
01:33:01,007 --> 01:33:02,848
A very angry mind.

990
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:05,328
This maybe a form of 5th force.

991
01:33:05,407 --> 01:33:07,568
It has controlled all the cell phones.

992
01:33:07,608 --> 01:33:09,608
It would've destroyed
our city given a chance.

993
01:33:09,647 --> 01:33:12,248
We succeeded only because
of Chitti's reappearance.

994
01:33:12,449 --> 01:33:13,688
Thank you, Chitti.

995
01:33:14,408 --> 01:33:17,489
I thank all of you
who have been a source of support.

996
01:33:17,929 --> 01:33:20,008
In our ancient classics

997
01:33:20,048 --> 01:33:27,169
we have heard many stories of God
descending on earth to destroy demons.

998
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:31,729
Lord Shiva Himself came as a robot
to save us from a fate worse than death

999
01:33:31,809 --> 01:33:35,930
I invite that Iron warrior Chitti
on to the dais to share a few words.

1000
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:44,371
When a warrior fights
his shadow battles along with him.

1001
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:48,091
When the warrior pierces and kills
the enemy, the shadow will follow suit.

1002
01:33:48,171 --> 01:33:52,572
So will we praise and
garland the shadow?

1003
01:33:52,692 --> 01:33:53,772
He is real

1004
01:33:53,811 --> 01:33:55,212
I am his shadow.

1005
01:33:55,332 --> 01:33:58,092
All glory and praise to
that God who created me.

1006
01:34:19,894 --> 01:34:20,894
Thank you.

1007
01:34:20,934 --> 01:34:23,733
At this juncture I must thank
and mention a specific name.

1008
01:34:23,734 --> 01:34:26,096
At the right moment
parting with the heart

1009
01:34:26,216 --> 01:34:28,656
I mean, giving the MPU

1010
01:34:28,735 --> 01:34:30,456
if I had not been activated

1011
01:34:30,535 --> 01:34:32,735
I couldn't have destroyed the evil force.

1012
01:34:32,816 --> 01:34:34,215
The name is...

1013
01:34:34,816 --> 01:34:36,056
Nila.

1014
01:34:46,696 --> 01:34:49,737
At this wonderful moment
a piece of good news for you.

1015
01:34:50,778 --> 01:34:54,058
Chitti who has been created
by Dr Vaseegaran

1016
01:34:54,179 --> 01:34:56,498
has been approved by our Govt.

1017
01:34:57,899 --> 01:34:59,779
An order has been passed this morning

1018
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:03,978
to create 500 Chitti robots
for our Indian army.

1019
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:06,659
Thank you.

1020
01:39:04,499 --> 01:39:06,339
Hi, scientist.

1021
01:39:21,821 --> 01:39:23,061
May I come in?

1022
01:39:29,461 --> 01:39:31,862
Irresponsible people.

1023
01:39:32,021 --> 01:39:34,302
Trash your cell phones.

1024
01:39:35,062 --> 01:39:37,263
This is your last chance.

1025
01:39:37,901 --> 01:39:39,222
Otherwise...

1026
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:41,503
death is certain!

1027
01:39:41,622 --> 01:39:43,703
I'm not the Mahesh
who got tagged in #MeToo, dear!

1028
01:39:43,742 --> 01:39:45,542
Check your phone properly
Why don't you-

1029
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:47,022
Didn't you hear what I said?

1030
01:39:50,463 --> 01:39:52,422
I always wear Victoria Secret, you know.

1031
01:39:52,423 --> 01:39:53,543
Including the latest one-

1032
01:40:17,585 --> 01:40:19,946
- Nila, is photon synthesizer set?
- Yes.

1033
01:40:23,105 --> 01:40:25,065
'Hey! Pub closes at midnight'

1034
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:26,506
'Let's go tomorrow'

1035
01:40:27,346 --> 01:40:28,426
'Hey! Stop... stop'

1036
01:40:33,307 --> 01:40:35,425
Doctor, what happened to you?

1037
01:40:35,466 --> 01:40:37,027
Why are you behaving like this?

1038
01:40:37,066 --> 01:40:39,107
Welcome, my dear 'nuts & bolt toy'

1039
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,587
I'm not your doctor!

1040
01:40:50,707 --> 01:40:52,987
Nila, turn on the neutralizer.

1041
01:41:10,349 --> 01:41:11,429
No...!

1042
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:12,750
Nila, stop it!

1043
01:41:21,390 --> 01:41:24,270
You can't do anything to me, Chitti.

1044
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:27,591
I have a body now.

1045
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:30,871
Dr Vaseegaran's body!

1046
01:41:31,551 --> 01:41:33,471
If you destroy me...

1047
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:36,712
it is the same as
you killing your God!

1048
01:41:38,391 --> 01:41:39,593
Now...

1049
01:41:39,632 --> 01:41:42,352
can you turn it on please?

1050
01:41:42,392 --> 01:41:44,111
Show off your technology.

1051
01:41:44,112 --> 01:41:45,192
Turn it on.

1052
01:41:45,193 --> 01:41:46,592
Switch it on, damn you!

1053
01:41:47,992 --> 01:41:49,072
Chitti...!

1054
01:41:49,113 --> 01:41:50,832
Don't hesitate Turn it on.

1055
01:41:50,833 --> 01:41:51,872
Destroy me.

1056
01:41:51,873 --> 01:41:53,673
He'll be destroyed along with me.

1057
01:41:53,753 --> 01:41:55,553
No, doctor I can't do that.

1058
01:41:55,593 --> 01:41:59,031
Chitti, thinking you are saving me
don't exterminate the entire human race.

1059
01:41:59,032 --> 01:42:00,073
Kill me.

1060
01:42:00,113 --> 01:42:01,073
Destroy him.

1061
01:42:01,114 --> 01:42:02,474
Kill me - Sorry, doctor.

1062
01:42:02,513 --> 01:42:04,473
Human emotion fed by you
is stopping me.

1063
01:42:04,513 --> 01:42:06,793
Moron! This is my order, kill me.

1064
01:42:08,193 --> 01:42:09,673
No, hold fire.

1065
01:42:10,034 --> 01:42:12,553
If you shoot, only Vaseegaran
will die unnecessarily.

1066
01:42:12,594 --> 01:42:13,995
Can't kill Pakshi Rajan.

1067
01:42:14,034 --> 01:42:15,674
Chitti, why are you stopping them?

1068
01:42:15,714 --> 01:42:17,394
Let them shoot me - No.

1069
01:42:28,995 --> 01:42:30,076
Chitti.

1070
01:42:31,515 --> 01:42:32,835
Aiyo! Chitti.

1071
01:42:33,275 --> 01:42:35,035
Nila, turn on the neutralizer.

1072
01:42:35,076 --> 01:42:36,476
'Come on, quick!'

1073
01:42:37,075 --> 01:42:38,077
Nila... NO!

1074
01:42:38,117 --> 01:42:39,196
'Don't do that'

1075
01:42:39,716 --> 01:42:41,516
Shut up! This is my order.

1076
01:42:41,556 --> 01:42:42,676
Switch it on.

1077
01:43:01,598 --> 01:43:02,838
Aiyo!

1078
01:43:02,918 --> 01:43:05,278
What you've done
is really foolish, Chitti.

1079
01:43:10,238 --> 01:43:13,078
Your 'call' is disconnected!

1080
01:43:44,201 --> 01:43:45,560
Chitti...?

1081
01:43:45,882 --> 01:43:47,721
What a pity!

1082
01:43:58,403 --> 01:44:00,082
Chitti... Chitti.

1083
01:44:01,362 --> 01:44:02,282
Chit-

1084
01:44:02,322 --> 01:44:03,362
Chitti.

1085
01:44:06,484 --> 01:44:08,163
Nila, go right now and-

1086
01:44:46,646 --> 01:44:49,166
"Earth shattering cyclone blows
today right now."

1087
01:44:49,246 --> 01:44:51,607
"He's gonna break, break, break
Break it down!"

1088
01:44:51,685 --> 01:44:54,167
"Pakshi Raja gonna destroy everyone."

1089
01:44:54,207 --> 01:44:56,526
"As quick as a stride
destruction of a different kind."

1090
01:44:56,527 --> 01:44:59,166
"Illusionary tricks galore
Danger! Caution all the more."

1091
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:01,806
"He's going to eat you alive."

1092
01:45:01,807 --> 01:45:03,888
"Run for your life"

1093
01:45:03,928 --> 01:45:08,247
"I am a bird of prey waiting to eat you
Feather-man who got into you head to toe."

1094
01:45:08,367 --> 01:45:10,927
"Pakshi Raja!"

1095
01:45:11,007 --> 01:45:14,288
"King of birds... Pakshi Raja"

1096
01:45:14,328 --> 01:45:18,128
"I have the souls of birds many
to seek revenge, flocking within me."

1097
01:45:18,169 --> 01:45:20,488
"King of birds... Pakshi Raja."

1098
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:05,942
Unique feeling of real joy
to die and get reactivated!

1099
01:48:10,462 --> 01:48:11,582
Pakshi.

1100
01:48:12,141 --> 01:48:15,143
Unlike your name
you can't fly any longer!

1101
01:48:20,743 --> 01:48:22,382
Hey, Nila...!

1102
01:48:22,423 --> 01:48:24,222
Why are you standing right there?

1103
01:48:24,783 --> 01:48:27,423
True to your name,
Nila should orbit the earth, eh?

1104
01:48:27,464 --> 01:48:29,023
Come... come... come.

1105
01:48:32,144 --> 01:48:33,623
Come on, baby.

1106
01:48:36,423 --> 01:48:37,864
Wow...!

1107
01:48:37,984 --> 01:48:41,024
Only 2 tasks of Vaseegaran
in his research are worthy of praise.

1108
01:48:41,065 --> 01:48:42,423
One is me.

1109
01:48:42,424 --> 01:48:43,865
The other is you!

1110
01:48:44,704 --> 01:48:45,944
What are you looking at?

1111
01:48:45,984 --> 01:48:47,024
Come on.

1112
01:48:47,064 --> 01:48:50,506
Give a beautiful kiss
to your great king, baby.

1113
01:48:57,025 --> 01:48:58,425
Stop the play, Chitti.

1114
01:48:58,465 --> 01:49:00,385
We must 1st destroy Pakshi.

1115
01:49:00,465 --> 01:49:02,826
Because he is even more powerful than you.

1116
01:49:03,426 --> 01:49:05,586
He's committing atrocities multi-fold.

1117
01:49:06,266 --> 01:49:08,826
He was able to shred
even you into million parts.

1118
01:49:09,106 --> 01:49:10,266
Now...

1119
01:49:10,306 --> 01:49:11,747
he's number 1 here.

1120
01:49:11,788 --> 01:49:13,066
Not you.

1121
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:22,506
Hey, this #1 and #2
are all child's play

1122
01:49:22,827 --> 01:49:24,748
I am the only one.

1123
01:49:25,947 --> 01:49:27,548
Super one!

1124
01:49:27,788 --> 01:49:30,107
No comparison, understand?

1125
01:49:30,227 --> 01:49:31,508
I understand, Chitti.

1126
01:49:31,948 --> 01:49:33,308
We must make him understand.

1127
01:49:33,348 --> 01:49:34,829
You bet I will.

1128
01:49:36,268 --> 01:49:38,109
The king of birds.

1129
01:49:38,868 --> 01:49:40,468
The battle is on!

1130
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:01,070
Left.

1131
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:02,430
Right.

1132
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,471
Head.

1133
01:50:04,031 --> 01:50:05,630
'Kamoshka'

1134
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:07,670
Activate command mode.

1135
01:50:07,711 --> 01:50:09,471
Command mode activated!

1136
01:50:20,111 --> 01:50:21,473
What is this?

1137
01:50:24,193 --> 01:50:25,512
It's me.

1138
01:50:26,273 --> 01:50:27,512
Mini me!

1139
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:32,872
So cute.

1140
01:50:52,435 --> 01:50:53,994
'What a game!'

1141
01:50:55,394 --> 01:50:57,314
'And now it's Half time
at the IFL finals'

1142
01:51:14,116 --> 01:51:15,916
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1143
01:51:25,557 --> 01:51:27,757
'We'll handle that later
Attend to your call'

1144
01:51:30,078 --> 01:51:32,237
(MULTIPLE PHONES RINGING)

1145
01:51:41,877 --> 01:51:43,917
Dear subscribers.

1146
01:51:44,279 --> 01:51:47,319
You are going to be
not reachable from now.

1147
01:51:47,518 --> 01:51:48,919
'Because...'

1148
01:51:49,079 --> 01:51:51,317
all of you will die now.

1149
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:54,319
'By no means an ordinary death'

1150
01:51:55,039 --> 01:51:56,759
'Radiation death!'

1151
01:51:57,839 --> 01:52:01,840
You will all die in groups
like how the sparrows collapsed.

1152
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:03,360
'Don't you get it?'

1153
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:10,280
I'll combine the radiation
from the cell phones all of you use

1154
01:52:11,281 --> 01:52:13,721
I'll download it on all of you.

1155
01:52:15,161 --> 01:52:16,841
Want to see a demo?

1156
01:52:25,121 --> 01:52:26,481
Hey, you...!

1157
01:52:28,522 --> 01:52:29,802
Ex... excuse me.

1158
01:52:30,721 --> 01:52:32,802
Why don't you select someone else?

1159
01:52:33,122 --> 01:52:34,122
Why?

1160
01:52:34,203 --> 01:52:35,362
I'm on your side.

1161
01:52:35,402 --> 01:52:36,562
How...?

1162
01:52:37,442 --> 01:52:39,562
I was the one who released you.

1163
01:52:40,843 --> 01:52:43,082
At least for that reason
let me go please.

1164
01:52:43,162 --> 01:52:44,282
So what?

1165
01:52:44,843 --> 01:52:46,883
You are a subscriber too, man.

1166
01:52:54,323 --> 01:52:55,884
Don't hurt me please.

1167
01:53:10,645 --> 01:53:13,045
"He's going to eat you alive"

1168
01:53:13,166 --> 01:53:17,085
"I am a bird of prey waiting to eat you
Feather-man who got into you head to toe."

1169
01:53:17,166 --> 01:53:18,886
"Pakshi Raja."

1170
01:53:18,926 --> 01:53:22,285
You will meet your end in this way,
a fate worse than ordinary death.

1171
01:53:22,326 --> 01:53:23,606
"Pakshi Raja."

1172
01:53:35,127 --> 01:53:40,007
In just 5 seconds, 70,000 people
were killed in Hiroshima.

1173
01:53:40,048 --> 01:53:41,847
Till date that was the world record.

1174
01:53:42,368 --> 01:53:45,128
Today... 80,000 men and women.

1175

Dear subscribers.

1179
01:54:03,289 --> 01:54:04,450
Don't panic.

1180
01:54:04,529 --> 01:54:06,688
You are not the ones
who are about to die.

1181
01:54:12,609 --> 01:54:14,490
A small bird.

1182
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:18,970
What are you looking at Pakshi?

1183
01:54:19,011 --> 01:54:20,249
I am Chitti.

1184
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:21,450

1187
01:54:33,491 --> 01:54:34,811
Did I shoot you?

1188
01:54:35,012 --> 01:54:36,331
Did I try to kill you?

1189
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,772
My God! I was about
to commit a grave sin.

1190
01:54:38,812 --> 01:54:40,732
Doctor, please don't harm me.

1191
01:54:40,812 --> 01:54:42,491
You are my creator.

1192
01:54:42,492 --> 01:54:44,492
Don't rip me apart with your own hands.

1193
01:54:44,533 --> 01:54:45,892
Forgive me and let me go.

1194
01:54:45,933 --> 01:54:46,933
Please.

1195
01:54:46,972 --> 01:54:48,012
Fat hopes!

1196
01:54:49,492 --> 01:54:50,813
Vasi...!

1197
01:55:36,935 --> 01:55:38,417
Come, you selfie bots!

1198
01:55:39,176 --> 01:55:41,177
I will set your screens on fire.

01:55:51,377 --> 01:55:54,617
"I stand tall, alone I stand
I cow down like, 'No man'."

1201
01:55:54,658 --> 01:55:56,698
"Are you ready? Take a shot"

1202
01:55:56,738 --> 01:55:58,057
"I am the only one."

1203
01:55:58,097 --> 01:56:01,179
"There is no comparison
'cos I am Super Super one"

1204
01:56:01,218 --> 01:56:03,499
"I'm out to get you
Let ya wreck ya self."

1205
01:56:03,538 --> 01:56:04,978
"See me coming out"

1206
01:56:05,019 --> 01:56:08,098
"10000 fighters by my side
I'm about to shoot 'em down."

1207
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:15,259
"I'm the only one you see."

1208
01:56:16,899 --> 01:56:18,419
Zero balance!

1209
01:57:01,142 --> 01:57:02,903
Shoot that sparrow.

1210
01:59:36,899 --> 01:59:39,139
Hey bird man!

1211
01:59:42,059 --> 01:59:43,821
Iron man!

1212
01:59:44,139 --> 01:59:45,900
I'm just a driver Let me go.

1213
02:00:23,427 --> 02:00:24,587
Pakshi!

1214
02:00:24,667 --> 02:00:26,788
You had better scatter
and scoot from here.

1215
02:00:26,868 --> 02:00:29,708
Otherwise I'll pluck
every single feather out.

1216
02:00:32,589 --> 02:00:34,430
You moron of a machine!

1217
02:00:34,509 --> 02:00:37,389
Why are you fighting
for these ungrateful men?

1218
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:40,990
When you've served their purpose
they will rip your nuts apart!

1219
02:03:45,022 --> 02:03:46,704
Hey! What's happening?

1220
02:04:05,907 --> 02:04:07,907
Yayayay... angry bird!

1221
02:04:08,707 --> 02:04:09,947
Why are you staring?

1222
02:04:09,987 --> 02:04:11,227
I am Kutti!

1223
02:04:11,308 --> 02:04:12,548

Version 3.O.

1225
02:04:15,988 --> 02:04:18,549
If you disturb my boss
your dove will be.

1226
02:04:18,588 --> 02:04:19,749
Dodo!

1227
02:04:20,669 --> 02:04:23,790
"I am Isaac Asimov's grandson, buddy"

1228
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:27,150
"I am a warrior, size of a turkey berry."

1229
02:04:33,752 --> 02:04:37,033
"O bird of prey
You're a goner, I say."

1230
02:04:37,152 --> 02:04:40,273
"It's 'Festival of lights' for us today."

1231
02:04:42,074 --> 02:04:44,674
It is said a bird can look
in 6 different directions.

1232
02:04:44,754 --> 02:04:46,754
Pakshi, won't you see?

1233
02:05:02,916 --> 02:05:03,916
Microbots.

1234
02:05:10,239 --> 02:05:11,358
No... no.

1235
02:05:11,518 --> 02:05:13,238
Hey! Don't do this.

1236
02:05:21,361 --> 02:05:23,441
Maintain that same panic.

1237
02:05:28,202 --> 02:05:30,283
"Birdie got caught-o?"

1238
02:05:30,802 --> 02:05:31,682
Bow bow.

1239
02:05:31,722 --> 02:05:33,202
"Feathers fell apart-o?"

1240
02:05:33,243 --> 02:05:34,323
"3.O"

1241
02:05:34,803 --> 02:05:36,763
"Swarmed all over you?"

1242
02:05:41,123 --> 02:05:44,846
Pakshi, if you breach this stadium
with your radiation

1243
02:05:44,885 --> 02:05:47,924
1st victims will be
only your birds!'

1244
02:05:59,607 --> 02:06:01,208
Microbots, go

1245
02:06:03,768 --> 02:06:05,289
"3.O"

1246
02:06:10,610 --> 02:06:11,850
"3.O"

1247
02:06:33,814 --> 02:06:36,974
"I am a cannon 6" tall
You're a radish, that's all"

1248
02:06:37,054 --> 02:06:40,255
"I am an automated masterpiece
I tricked you with zetabyte-ease"

1249
02:06:40,335 --> 02:06:43,775
"I am the evil mosquito Ranguski
Ready to send you to the cemetery."

1250
02:06:43,815 --> 02:06:47,335
"Itsy-bitsy, I'm snuff powder heady
I'm into your nostril, deal with me."

1251
02:06:50,336 --> 02:06:53,176
A lion can't touch a mosquito, big birdie!

1252
02:06:53,377 --> 02:06:56,978
But if mosquitoes set their minds
they can chase the lion to its doom.

1253
02:07:00,699 --> 02:07:02,059
Cuckoo!

1254
02:07:12,221 --> 02:07:13,620
Good job, 3.O.

1255
02:07:15,061 --> 02:07:16,220
Thank you, commander.

1256
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:18,181
- Microbots positioned?
- All set.

1257
02:07:18,741 --> 02:07:19,822
Pakshi.

1258
02:07:23,703 --> 02:07:25,182
Have a blast!

1259
02:08:07,989 --> 02:08:10,150
Should these doves also explode?

1260
02:08:11,150 --> 02:08:13,471
Hey beep Follow me.

1261
02:08:14,711 --> 02:08:16,272
Come on, bots.

1262
02:08:32,234 --> 02:08:35,235
"O eagle, you're a goner, I say."

1263
02:08:35,275 --> 02:08:38,556
"It's 'Conquest of good over evil' today."

1264
02:08:38,676 --> 02:08:41,956
"Bird of prey It's a jolly day."

1265
02:08:41,997 --> 02:08:45,157
"You are a guest in hell any which way."

1266
02:08:45,236 --> 02:08:48,717
"People's favorite
'Podimas' minuute."

1267
02:08:48,758 --> 02:08:51,638
"If I burst, it will be a wrecker
like a boom-boom cracker."

1268
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:53,959
Hey! Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1269
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:54,960
This is restricted area.

1270
02:08:54,999 --> 02:08:55,999
Get out!

1271
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:06,470
You are the reason
we are alive today, Vaseegaran.

1272
02:10:06,910 --> 02:10:09,870
What an enormous risk you've taken
and saved all of us!

1273
02:10:09,910 --> 02:10:11,950
Technology saved us.

1274
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:15,820
But we are the ones
misusing technology.

1275
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:19,220
We should eliminate poverty
with the help of technology.

1276
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:20,539
Eradicate diseases.

1277
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:22,179
Promote education.

1278
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:26,780
If we use it for personal comforts and
fuelling our greed, it's only doomsday.

1279
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:30,210
Will... will that Pakshi Rajan reappear?

1280
02:10:32,250 --> 02:10:34,050
He is dead and gone.

1281
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:38,090
But if we continue this way
another 'evil force' will erupt.

1282
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:41,890
Even if Pakshi Rajan's actions were wrong

1283
02:10:41,970 --> 02:10:43,720
there was truth in his words.

1284
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:47,800
If human beings should live on earth
birds should also co exist.

1285
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:51,000
Control radiation.

1286
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:53,199
Reduce networks.

1287
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:59,190
Pass a rule, no technology should affect
any living thing, human, bird or beast.

1288
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:01,710
This earth doesn't belong only to us.

1289
02:11:01,950 --> 02:11:06,150
Everyone should realize it belongs
to all the living creatures here.

1290
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:08,070
You are right.

1291
02:11:08,190 --> 02:11:10,020
Ensure birds are not destroyed.

1292
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:15,140
At least provide water for birds
to drink during our scorching summers.

1293
02:11:16,740 --> 02:11:19,380
That's enough to refresh
and revitalize your minds.

1294
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:21,860
All this will happen, Vaseegaran

1295
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:24,530
I'll bring this to the notice
of our Parliament

1296
02:11:24,690 --> 02:11:27,050
I'll make sure this happens.

1297
02:11:28,010 --> 02:11:29,490
Thank you, Vaseegaran.

1298
02:11:33,690 --> 02:11:34,850
Thanks, Nila.

1299
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:36,850
Why are you thanking your shadow?

1300
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:40,880
Oh God!

1301
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:43,360
We have to remove
that red chip from Chitti.

1302
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:44,560
Don't worry, boss.

1303
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:48,720
To be on the safe side I activated it
after doing an auto-eject program.

1304
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,710
Smaaart!

1305
02:11:58,470 --> 02:12:00,590
Good to see you alright, doctor.

1306
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:02,070
Me too, Chitti.

1307
02:12:02,150 --> 02:12:06,300
Doctor, all the robots and I have to report
in the headquarters at Delhi today.

1308
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:08,140
Can I leave, doctor?

1309
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:13,460
Take Nila with you

1310
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:19,780
subtitled by rekhs
assisted by harini & pradeep.

1311
02:12:19,930 --> 02:12:21,930
Doctor, how can I leave you like this and-

1312
02:12:22,050 --> 02:12:23,490
I can take care of myself.

1313
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:25,050
'Respect for love?!'

1314
02:12:26,130 --> 02:12:27,250
GO...!

1315
02:12:32,250 --> 02:12:33,160
Thanks, doctor.

1316
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:39,080
"My love, my life, my battery
Don't go away from me."

1317
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:45,680
"My sole soul friend, my battery
Don't decrease even a bit, dearie."

1318
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:12,700
"O' damsel from the world of machinery
You shower love through numbers binary."

1319
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:16,210
"You lean on my engine-body
and please me in rhapsody."

1320
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:19,409
"Hey! My exquisite electric wifey!"

1321
02:13:19,410 --> 02:13:22,650
"Shall I kiss your bloodless cheeks, miss?"

1322
02:13:22,730 --> 02:13:26,010
"And make a new Java rose bloom in bliss?"

1323
02:13:26,050 --> 02:13:29,400
"Shall I feed you
with data brand new?"

1324
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:32,520
"Hey! I am your 'bus conductor' true"

1325
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:38,680
“My magic metallic heart, my battery
Don't ever leave me”

1326
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:44,470
“My sole soul mate, my battery
Don't decrease even a bit, dearie”

1327
02:13:45,470 --> 02:13:51,710
“My gripper, my gears, my battery
Don't go away from me”

1328
02:13:52,150 --> 02:13:58,340
“My wonder wheels, pistons, my battery
Don't decrease even a bit, dearie”.

1329
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:05,500
"Metal maiden from the world of machinery
You embrace me with numbers binary."

1330
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:09,010
"You throttle my engine to flirt with me"

1331
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:12,250
“Hey! My wifey animated by electricity”

1332
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:03,540
“You are my sensor's sense
Plus its food and essence”

1333
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:07,010
“You're the data miracle
spreading through my cable”

1334
02:15:07,050 --> 02:15:09,930
“My engine is driven by your magic spell”.

1335
02:15:10,010 --> 02:15:13,410
"My every neuron cell
is your 'mass' and moon as well."

1336
02:15:13,450 --> 02:15:16,849
"My username is you
My password too."

1337
02:15:16,850 --> 02:15:20,360
"You're my genie
special laptop Rajini."

1338
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:24,720
"My dear iron flower, steel sweety-softy".

1339
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:29,880
"Shall we melt to unite today, hottie?"

1340
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:37,270
“You're my Alpha, my beginning”

1341
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:44,150
“You're my Omega, my ending”

1342
02:15:44,230 --> 02:15:50,540
“Love you from zero to infinity”

1343
02:15:50,660 --> 02:15:56,580
“My love, my life, my battery
Don't go away from me”

1344
02:15:56,980 --> 02:16:03,370
“My sole soul friend, my battery
Don't decrease even a bit, dearie”

1345
02:16:03,450 --> 02:16:09,650
“My gripper, my gears, my battery
Don't ever leave me”

1346
02:16:36,910 --> 02:16:43,420
“O' angel from the world of machinery
You shower love through numbers binary”.

1347
02:16:43,460 --> 02:16:46,660
"You lean on my engine-body
and tease me in rhapsody"

1348
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:50,060
“Hey! My ravishing robot-wifey!”

1349
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:52,860
“Shall I kiss your bloodless cheeks, miss?”

1350
02:16:53,300 --> 02:16:56,530
"I'll make a new Java rose bloom in bliss?"

1351
02:16:56,610 --> 02:16:59,889
“Shall I feed you
with data brand new?”

1352
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:03,010
“Hey! I am your 'bus conductor' true”

1353
02:17:03,050 --> 02:17:08,690
“My wires, my world, my battery
Don't ever leave me”

1354
02:17:09,490 --> 02:17:15,200
“My cyborg companion, my battery
Don't decrease even a bit, dearie”

1355
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:21,830
“My beloved bot, my battery
Don't go away from me”

1356
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:28,670
“My bold and beautiful bot, my battery
Don't decrease even a bit, dearie”.

1357
02:18:01,890 --> 02:18:03,730
Helloooo, Sana sweetie.

1358
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:06,480
'So much has happened
Why didn't anyone tell me?'

1359
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:09,320
- 'Not even 1 phone call, text or e-mail'
- Sana, listen to me.

1360
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:12,160
'I am almost dying in fear
Where did that wretched Nila disappear?'

1361
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:13,840
Can't this phone fly away now?!

1362
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:37,020
Hey senior!
Why are you so dazed?

1363
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:38,540
Were you scared?

1364
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:39,780
Just for laughs!

1365
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:42,339
Hey! Who are you?

1366
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:43,500
I am Kutti.

1367

Compressed version

1368
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:46,780
3.O...!

1369
02:18:46,890 --> 02:18:48,250
Your grandson.

1370
02:18:54,650 --> 02:18:55,770
Muah!

1371
02:19:26,270 --> 02:19:29,500
"O eagle, you're a goner I say."

1372
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:32,860
"It's 'Festival of lights' for us today."

1373
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:36,179
"Bird of prey It's a jolly day."

1374
02:19:36,180 --> 02:19:39,379
"You are a guest in hell any which way."

1375
02:19:39,380 --> 02:19:42,650
"People's favorite
'Podimas' minuute."

1376
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:46,010
"If I burst, it will be a wrecker
like a boom-boom cracker."

1377
02:19:46,050 --> 02:19:49,209
"Boss, I am a microbot."

1378
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:52,650
"If you get caught
dude, you're kaput!"

1379
02:19:55,570 --> 02:19:57,080
"3.O"

1380
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:03,600
"3.O"

"I am a cannon 6" tall
You're a radish, that's all"

1382

I tricked you with zetabyte-ease."

1383
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:33,620
"I am a cannon 6" tall
You're a radish, that's all"

1384
02:20:33,660 --> 02:20:36,970
"I am an automated robot
I conned you without a doubt"

1385
02:20:37,010 --> 02:20:40,529
"I am the evil mosquito Ranguski
Ready to send you to the cemetery."

1386
02:20:40,530 --> 02:20:44,330
"Itsy-bitsy, I'm snuff powder heady
I'm into your nostril, deal with me"
