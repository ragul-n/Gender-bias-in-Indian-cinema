1
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,791
Why are you blowing on it?

2
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,416
Isn’t it working?

3
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:20,875
It’s working, sir.

4
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,791
Ever since the movie began, you were blowing.

5
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,875
And the movie is almost over now. 
Go and take care of it.

6
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,416
Sir? The heroine isn’t here yet.
-She wouldn’t!

7
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,416
Her make-up is a lot more compared 
to the amount of work she does.

8
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,666
She constantly keeps reapplying her makeup.

9
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,916
And when it comes to acting, 
she just goes overboard!

10
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,791
You guys here hang the mikes about your neck!

11
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,291
Please do something urgently and get her over here.
The director is already on his way here.

12
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,458
Ok sir
-And this fellow here with his phone…

13
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,500
Where the hell did you go?
-Sir, your coffee.

14
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,625
The director is already on his way here.

15
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,000
He might be just a director to you but he is my boss.

16
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,000
When he comes here, he is going to 
blow the roof!

17
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,041
What is it?
-Coffee, sir.

18
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,625
Give me a little poison. I’ll drink it.
-Sure, sir.

19
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:52,916
Go away! Go!
-Okay, sir.

20
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,208
What a waste of human space!

21
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,541
He is here.

22
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,333
Good morning, sir.

23
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,958
Is everything, ready?

24
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,333
Everything’s been ready since
 6 o’clock in the morning, sir.

25
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,166
It’s really ready, sir.
-Okay, then. Let’s go.

26
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,041
Sir, the heroine doesn’t like the color of the dress.

27
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,166
She said she wouldn’t be wearing it.

28
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,250
Is that so?

29
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,375
Tell her to wear the color she prefers.

30
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,250
I am going to take the shot that I prefer too.

31
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,125
She has to roll around the temple
 a hundred times in prayer.

32
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,208
And it’s going to be a single shot.
Go and tell her that.

33
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,208
Super, sir!

34
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,041
Darshan.
-Yes, sir.

35
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,125
The shot’s going to be like this.

36
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,250
Guide the crane smoothly downwards.
-Okay, sir.

37
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,750
And keep charging forward.

38
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,875
That is when the heroine will enter the scene.

39
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,416
Keep charging in smoothly.
-Okay, sir.

40
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,333
I hope you have the zoom lens on.
-Yes, sir. I have Zoom lens on.

41
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,541
Going for one more.
Same positions.

42
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,166
One more, sir. 

43
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,291
Ready!

44
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,041
Lights.

45
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,041
Sound.

46
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:01,833
Start camera.

47
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:02,750
Action!

48
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:07,375
Cut!

49
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:08,833
Shot okay for me!

50
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,125
Going for last shot.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,916
Chandini.
-Sir?

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,291
This is going to be the last shot.

53
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,500
Get the pumpkin ready.

54
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,208
Okay sir.

55
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:17,958
Camera, same position.

56
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:23,250
Oh, What is this?
You wrote it like it was some epic!

57
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,375
Would anyone do this on a Monday?

58
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,875
Don’t just keep using your tummy.
Use your head too! Correct it!

59
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,375
Dimwits all around me!
Damn it!

60
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:31,625
Sir! sir!

61
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,833
Mr. Subbu?
Where is the pumpkin?

62
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,666
He’s already asking for it!
-The director is asking for it.

63
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,458
Teja, clear the background.

64
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,000
No one does a good job.

65
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:40,875
Sir,

66
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,333
madam recommended that we break the pumpkin 
during the auspicious hour, which is an hour away.

67
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,541
Where is she?
Tell her to hurry.

68
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,125
Okay, sir.

69
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,708
I deposited the cash. 

70
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,708
Please check it.

71
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,791
Madam, juice for you.

72
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:01,958
What is this?

73
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,083
I asked you for juice.
I didn’t ask for water.

74
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,458
You charge us a lot anyways.

75
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,500
But the quality you deliver is horrible!

76
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,250
Change it or else you will be replaced.

77
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:13,958
Sorry, madam.

78
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,375
I’ll bring you a fresh one.

79
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,750
No one here does their job right!

80
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,875
Madam, the director wants to break the pumpkin now.

81
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,291
Alright, I’ll talk to him.

82
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,333
Sir, call the artist.

83
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,750
What’s wrong with you?
You suggested we break the pumpkin during the auspicious hour?

84
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:30,833
Is that really necessary?

85
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,500
Nothing like that.

86
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,666
The priest suggested that wrapping this 
up during the auspicious hours would do us good.

87
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,750
You’ve already made up your mind, right?

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,291
Go ahead and do that.

89
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,458
What’s going on with you?
Why do you keep dreaming?

90
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,208
The movie is going to be released in fifteen days.

91
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,250
Go and work on it.
-Okay sir.

92
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,125
These people just do what they please.

93
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,083
Positions!

94
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,416
Even though, there are a plethora of options such as the internet

95
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,041
mobile phones, OTTs, apps, etc., to choose
 from, in the entertainment industry,

96
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,041
the release of a movie in the theatres is unparalleled.

97
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,333
And if it’s a movie of a big star,

98
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,833
it’s not just about entertainment.
It’s almost a festival.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,541
One such movie that ticks all those boxes, 'Pralayam'
 is going to be released tomorrow.

100
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,750
All the trailers and songs of the movie 
that have been released thus far, 

101
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,708
students and job holders play hooky with their studies and work, 

102
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:29,625
The director has made the movie so interesting that 

103
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:33,208
There are high chances that this movie 
will make history in the Telugu film industry.

104
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,083
The fans are celebrating.

105
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,875
It doesn’t have a great plot!

106
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:43,583
It’s not good.

107
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,666
Nope, not that great.

108
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,125
There’s not much to say about it.

109
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,708
Disaster!
Disaster!

110
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,083
I wasn’t impressed by it.

111
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,083
It looks pretty ordinary.

112
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,625
The movie wasn’t good.

113
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,041
Dear god! Save us!

114
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,125
I never imagined I would be tortured in this manner.

115
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,583
There is no plot line at all.

116
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,958
The direction was really horrible.

117
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,375
The movie is made entirely wrong.

118
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:05,250
Mr. Mahesh, the movie ‘Pralayam’ came to 
the box office with a lot of expectations.

119
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,500
How did you find it? What’s your review of it?

120
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:14,333
After watching the movie, I felt that I 
wasted two hours of my precious time in life.

121
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,250
What sort of a story did they select and 
how did they make it so horrible?

122
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,375
And that heroine…she just appears suddenly for the songs.

123
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,875
And those villains are there just to take a punch.

124
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,666
The comedy bits were tasteless.

125
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,625
All this mess brought us to tears!

126
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,375
In one scene when the hero was thrashing the villians,

127
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,208
I felt that the director was hitting us.

128
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,708
If you had to point at the reason for
 the failure of this movie,

129
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,791
what would it be?
Who else can we blame but the director?

130
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,583
Don’t we call him the captain of the ship?

131
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,666
According to the information we have,

132
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,041
we understand that the director has 
only one hero’s schedule in his kitty.

133
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,750
If this movie flops, that would be the end of it.

134
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:47,958
What nonsense is she talking?

135
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,083
What nonsense is she talking?

136
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,416
Are they reviewing the movie or taking revenge on me?

137
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,250
We make movies with our money and lose our money.

138
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,333
What have they got to lose?

139
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,208
They pocketed lakhs of rupees to 
give good reviews about the movie

140
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,583
And now, they’ve turned tables.

141
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,041
It’s the way the media works, sir.

142
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,541
They just lie in wait for the scapegoat.

143
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,250
And now, it’s our turn to be one.

144
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:09,375
Well, if the movie was really good,
 they would give good reviews.

145
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,583
And you do nothing?! Why can’t you stop them?

146
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,291
Do you think this is a movie shoot? 
You call cut and then everything stops?

147
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,125
This is media.

148
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,916
We have nothing in our control except the remote.

149
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,708
If it bothers you, better switch off the TV.

150
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,750
Well, go and...
You and your stupid remarks!

151
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,458
That stupid hero made me put useless fights 
and songs in totally unnecessary parts of the script!

152
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,708
Now, everyone’s blaming me.

153
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,166
Weren’t you the one who suggested that I 
take hero’s recommendations seriously because of his fan base?

154
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,291
You used excuses such as requests from
 the distributors, pressures from the markets,

155
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,333
and many such nonsensical things!

156
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,250
The hero is unscathed.
It’s me who’s lost my reputation.

157
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,708
If the movie does well, credit goes to the hero.

158
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,625
If the movie doesn’t do well, blame the director.

159
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,583
Everyone likes to take their money but no one does their job!

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,291
And those stupid remarks and sarcasm!
Rascal!

161
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,875
Madam, don’t let your husband out in the public.

162
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,708
The media will rush to him with their mikes
 hoping to catch him off guard.

163
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,291
There’s no plot!

164
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,458
No plot at all.

165
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,875
The direction was horrible.

166
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,250
There were a lot of mistakes in the movie.

167
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:23,916
After watching the movie, 
I felt that I lost two hours of my precious time in life.

168
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,416
What a tasteless comedy.
It was unbearable to watch.

169
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,500
The villains exist only to get thrashed.

170
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,125
I felt like the director was thrashing us.

171
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,791
Who else can we blame other than the director?

172
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,791
We are reducing to tears watching such a horrible movie.

173
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,333
I think he’s forgotten how to make a movie.

174
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,958
What sort of a story did he select? 
And what sort of a direction is that?

175
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,791
The direction was horrible.

176
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,375
It was bad.

177
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:50,291
There is no plot.
There is no plot in the movie.

178
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,083
Who else can we blame but the director?

179
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
We are reduced to tears watching such a horrible movie.

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,541
What tasteless comedy.

181
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,416
I think he’s forgotten how to make a movie.

182
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:27,208
Priest, early this morning, I had a bad dream.

183
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,583
I dreamt that my husband met with an
 accident and lost his life.

184
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,875
They say that early morning dreams come true.

185
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,708
I am very scared.

186
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,208
Could you please check up on his horoscope?

187
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,666
I already told you that he has a problem.

188
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,583
Hold on.
I will check it again.

189
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,958
The planets in your husband’s horoscope are not friendly.

190
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,416
He is going through a rough phase.

191
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,291
To ensure that these obstacles are removed, I
 will make sure to offer prayers.

192
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,083
But,you must take really good care of your husband.

193
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,875
I told you not to disturb me.

194
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,375
The hero is on the line.

195
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,833
He says that your phone’s been switched off.

196
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:32,833
Good morning, sir.

197
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:33,750
Tell me.

198
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,416
Nothing much, sir. This is just a casual call.

199
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,916
Regarding our movie…
-Small divided talk ..

200
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,583
I heard the same as well.

201
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,500
This is pretty much common in this industry.

202
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,166
This time around, we will make a big hit.

203
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,458
Sir, I have a small suggestion.

204
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,250
I really like the story that you pitched last time.

205
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,041
But the current trend is all about crimes and thrillers.

206
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,208
This time, let’s try and stick to this genre. 

207
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,375
Given the movies I’ve been doing, it would be a good addition.

208
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,750
And you would have tried a different genre too.

209
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,250
Okay, sir.
Call me when you have the story ready.

210
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,416
Until yesterday, he believed that 
starring in my movie was a very big deal.

211
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,125
Now, he has opinions on the stories I must write.

212
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,166
From tomorrow on, I might have
 to take suggestions from the office boy.

213
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:15,958
Raghu…

214
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,458
We are in an industry that measures our worth through our success.

215
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,708
These kinds of things are pretty common, aren’t they?

216
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,083
Your next movie should shut them up.

217
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,333
It doesn’t take too much of an effort 
on your part to write a story.

218
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,041
Why don’t you take a break?

219
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,958
Shall we head to Goa?

220
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:37,916
No.

221
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,333
Switch on the geyser.

222
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,708
I will freshen up.

223
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,291
Come in, Chandini.

224
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:56,583
How are you?

225
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,125
I am doing good, ma’am.

226
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,166
How is he?

227
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,375
He is good.

228
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,125
Have you decided when you would
 be starting your next project?

229
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,125
Well, the movie didn’t do well.

230
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,708
The hero asked him to change the story.

231
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,375
He is quite frustrated that the story isn’t 
developing as per his expectations.

232
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,458
Sometimes when I look at him, I am quite frightened.

233
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,541
He is very stressed.

234
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,458
Changing the story so suddenly is quite difficult, ma’am.

235
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,625
Here, have it.

236
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,000
Don’t mind me saying this but…

237
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,375
the situation out there for us is very dire.

238
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,708
The people are laughing at us.

239
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,833
We must make the next movie a hit.

240
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,666
It would be better to hire a writer, ma’am.

241
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,958
That is what everyone does.

242
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,166
Handling the script like your husband does, is not easy.

243
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:47,583
Well, if you need some financial help,
 take some money with you.

244
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,458
That’s alright, ma’am.
If I need money, I will surely ask.

245
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,291
Do you want me to help him in some way or another?

246
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,708
I will talk to him about it and give you a call.

247
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,458
Alright, ma’am.

248
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,458
I shall take my leave.

249
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,625
Thank you.

250
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,791
Have some food.

251
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,791
I don’t want anything.

252
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,916
This is exactly what’s wrong with you.

253
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,750
Will you forget to eat just because you are busy with work?

254
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,833
You need to have energy to work hard.

255
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,000
Please have some.

256
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,541
Please let me work.
I told you that I don’t want it.

257
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,666
No matter how much I write, it isn’t giving me a high.

258
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,541
I am very frustrated.

259
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,083
Please?

260
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,083
Why don’t you ask Chandini to help you?

261
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,875
Chandini is an assistant director.

262
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,041
She is okay with directing but she 
doesn’t have it in her to handle a script.

263
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,000
Directing is very different from writing.

264
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,875
I hope you wouldn’t lose your temper 
with what I’m about to say.

265
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:18,291
What is it?

266
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,583
There it is! You are already angry.

267
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,416
Alright, fine. Tell me.

268
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,791
It might be a good idea to hire a writer.

269
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:31,208
You mean you don’t believe that
 I have it in me to write good stories?

270
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,500
No! That’s not what I meant.

271
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,458
There’s no one in this industry 
who writes better dialogues than you.

272
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:41,041
No one is able to make the hero look so stylish in the film.

273
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:45,250
But, looking at you all stressed out is worrying me.

274
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,291
I get it.

275
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,666
I’ve been writing the scripts for over ten years.

276
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,958
Now, you want me to depend on someone else, huh?

277
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,208
So, my mind’s gotten old, huh?

278
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,291
Why would you misunderstand me?

279
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,541
I know what I’m supposed to do.
You can leave.

280
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:03,333
Raghu, I am your wife. Please try and 
understand how I feel.

281
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,375
Looking at you go crazy is making me very worried.

282
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,416
What do you want me to do?

283
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,708
Hire a writer.

284
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:17,750
Please.

285
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,916
Subbu, do you know of a good writer?

286
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,458
There are loads of them in software…perhaps in hordes.

287
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,791
Are we talking about the same thing?

288
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,333
That’s the current trend.

289
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,500
Oh god! I mustn’t be the one to say it but…

290
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,416
…those IT people have their laptops
 on and watch movies of china,

291
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,250
Japan, Korea, Malaysia, France, Finnish, etc.

292
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,416
They watch all kinds of movies and come up with stories.

293
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,833
They are the current trend.

294
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,500
I don’t want someone like that. 

295
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Look for a young and sharp writer.

296
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,833
Who needs him?

297
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,750
We do.

298
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,916
We?

299
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,375
Why would we need him, madam?
Isn’t your husband a great writer?

300
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,125
A lot of writers were interested in working
 under him but he never agreed to it.

301
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,666
Will he really agree to hire another writer?

302
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,416
I will talk to him about this.

303
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,583
And make sure you keep this to yourself
 instead of shouting it from the roof tops!

304
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,333
These days, no one shouts from the roof tops.
Everything’s through social media.

305
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,500
Every small thing goes viral.

306
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,375
Subbu…

307
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,291
Nothing of that sort would happen, madam.

308
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:23,625
I will make sure to bring you a writer 
who matches your husband’s pace and vision.

309
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,625
Alright, then be on the lookout.

310
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:26,958
Look out for what, madam?

311
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,333
Subbu!

312
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,791
Balu…writer.

313
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,458
I wonder who he’s been telling his stories to.

314
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,000
He says, “I trusted you because 
you were my friend and you betrayed me.”

315
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,833
He takes the knife and plunges it over and over again…

316
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,041
It doesn’t look like you are narrating a story.
It looks like you are murdering me.

317
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,125
How is the story?

318
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,333
As smooth and seamless as drinking imported liquor.

319
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,041
Who is the hero?

320
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,750
My dear fellow, get ten million rupees from your father.

321
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,666
You will be the hero of the movie.

322
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,666
I am already a big hero in Vijaywada.

323
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,958
No one can hold a candle to the image I’ve created for myself.

324
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,458
I came here all the way from Andhra because 
I couldn’t find good liquor and wanted to enjoy myself a bit…

325
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,958
And here you are making me a fool.

326
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,125
If you make a movie, 
I will handle the publicity in Area.

327
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,125
That’s all I can do.

328
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,000
Listen, if you become a hero, 
there will be huge posters of you.

329
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,250
Well, my friend Sai would do the same for a thousand bucks.

330
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,333
Why would I need ten million bucks?

331
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,833
Useless fellow!

332
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,666
Why were you even born?

333
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,000
Good question, Balu.

334
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,625
My grandfather bequeathed 100 acres of land to my father.

335
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,458
My father turned that into 200 acres.

336
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,791
If someone like me wasn’t born,

337
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:36,041
who is going to eat all those chickens, goats, 
fishes, birds that was born just for my consumption?

338
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,916
Who is going to purchase the fruits, veggies and rice?

339
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,291
Who is going to smoke those cigarettes?
Who is going to drink so many cases of beer?

340
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,375
(Speaking gibberish)

341
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,208
It’s because of useless people like me that
 there are such high standards in the society.

342
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,291
Okay.

343
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,541
That’s enough.

344
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,958
You sit down, I'll see

345
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,958
Chandini? How are you?

346
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,666
When did you come?
-Just this morning.

347
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,208
Heard that your movie’s a flop.

348
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:13,625
Idiot!

349
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:16,666
So haughty.

350
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:23,083
Go out and have some breakfast and come back after an hour.

351
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,000
I get it.

352
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,041
On your way back, get me some breakfast too

353
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,916
What happened, baby?
Why do you seem so irritated?

354
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,625
Hey! Don’t keep ‘babying’ or ‘honeying’ me.

355
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,333
I hate that.

356
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,791
Chandini…Chandini Reddy.

357
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,000
So, stylish!
Your arrogance is part of your charm.

358
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,125
It’s not arrogance.
It’s self-respect.

359
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,208
I will give you a lot of that.

360
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,333
Why don’t you help me assist your director too?

361
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,500
I will be able to learn a lot working with him.

362
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,166
It’s not that easy.

363
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,500
A lot of people are eager to join his team.

364
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,750
But he doesn’t select them at all.

365
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,083
You mean, he wouldn’t select me even if you recommended?

366
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,250
Don’t try to appease me.

367
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,291
If he just gets his hand on a piece of paper.

368
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,666
He will write out at least 30 scenes in a 
span of 30 minutes.

369
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,958
Why would he need you?

370
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,333
Anyways, I will try. 

371
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,583
That’s really comforting.

372
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,791
It would be great if we are at the same place

373
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,916
We can even work together.

374
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:19,416
What work?

375
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:25,500
Well…if you agree, we can do whatever you want.

376
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,666
Anyways, you told me that you 
would give me a story for my directorial venture?

377
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,083
Story? That’s ready.

378
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,458
Once we find a producer, 
the movie is going to be on the floor.

379
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,791
Really?

380
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,125
Love you.
-Love you too.

381
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,458
Let’s go for shopping. Do you want to?

382
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,625
 Well, my buddy is around.
I don’t think it would be wise to leave him alone.

383
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,541
You go ahead.

384
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,166
Just keep drinking until you drop dead!

385
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,416
Now that the porcupine’s here,
…your sole focus would be drinking!

386
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,500
You’ve been waiting out.

387
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,041
Looks like you have a lot of expectations.

388
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,000
Do you want some breakfast?

389
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,208
Get lost!
You uncouth person!

390
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,958
Oh goodness, my buddy lies to stuff himself.

391
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,458
Oh shit!
So many missed calls?

392
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,125
Where are you?

393
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,625
I called you many times. 
Why don’t you pick up the call?

394
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,541
Sir…sir…
My phone was in the silent mode. I missed it.

395
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,458
Tomorrow, you are going to be meeting a very important person.

396
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,458
Who is it, sir?

397
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,291
My boss, director Raghu Ram.

398
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,458
Sir!
Really? Is it him?

399
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,458
I will share the location with you.
Come there at 10 in the morning.

400
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,958
Definitely, sir. For sure.

401
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,166
Listen, on your way up the ladder you mustn’t forget me.

402
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:45,083
don’t you know about me?
I won’t forget you, sir.

403
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,625
I believe you that’s why I recommended you.

404
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,000
Another thing…

405
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,500
you mustn’t breathe about this to any person.

406
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:51,583
Why is that?

407
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,875
Do you want work or do you 
want to make a name?

408
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,666
Okay, I get it.

409
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,416
Tomorrow morning, at ten, I’ll be there.

410
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,791
Okay, sir.
Thank you very much sir.

411
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,333
Who are you looking for?

412
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,250
Is Mr. Raghu Ram at home?
-Who are you?

413
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:12,500
Mr. Subramaniam asked me to come by.

414
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:13,416
Come in.

415
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,666
Okay, okay.
I think he is here.

416
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,125
Balu?
-Yes, ma’am.

417
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,250
Sit down.

418
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,125
Please sit.

419
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,625
What would you like to have?
Coffee? Tea?

420
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,958
No, that’s alright.
-It’s okay.

421
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:54,458
Coffee, please.

422
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,500
Sita, coffee please.

423
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,333
Good morning, sir.

424
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:02,375
Sit down.

425
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,583
What movies did you work on?

426
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,291
Officially, I haven’t been credited for my work
But, I did write for successful movies.

427
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,666
Previously, who did you work for?

428
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,916
All small-time directors. 

429
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,458
I haven’t had the opportunity of 
working with big directors like Mr. Raghu Ram.

430
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,708
Okay.
What kind of genres do you prefer?

431
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:25,750
Crime, madam.

432
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:28,916
Why did you pick that genre?

433
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,708
Sir, I am from Vijayawada.

434
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,500
I was born and brought up in Labbipeta.

435
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:38,041
Ever since my childhood, I was 
amidst a neighborhood that was rife with crime.

436
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:40,291
Gangs…fights…murders…

437
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:44,875
Watching all these, I got deeply 
interested in the genre of crime.

438
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:48,125
Can you tell me something new about crime?

439
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:49,291
Of course.

440
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:50,416
When will you tell me?

441
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,416
Right now.

442
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:52,416
Really?

443
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:56,458
Okay, tell me.

444
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,333
This story is set in 1980s in Vijayawada.

445
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:04,250
In the opening scene…

446
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,291
This is the pre climax, sir.

447
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,416
So, what’s the climax?

448
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:56,250
That is dependent on the director’s style.

449
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,250
I will give you an unimaginable twist in the tale.

450
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,000
Did you narrate this story to anyone else?

451
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,625
No, sir.
This is the first time.

452
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,833
If that’s the case, get the script 
and come for dinner tomorrow.

453
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,791
Okay, sir.

454
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:06,666
Thank you.

455
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,000
Thank you, ma’am.

456
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:13,833
Isn’t the story good?

457
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,041
He’s done a good job of working on it.

458
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:17,625
It will do well.

459
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,833
If so, let’s take the script and make 
the movie under our banner.

460
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:21,791
Let’s see.

461
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,041
Why hurry?

462
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:26,958
You look at ease and that’s making me relaxed too.

463
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,500
I was worried that you might not like the story.

464
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,958
You agreeing to this is really a big deal.

465
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,000
Nothing of that sort.

466
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,708
I agreed because I didn’t want you worried.

467
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:41,625
And we really did listen to a good story.

468
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,208
Cheers!

469
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,125
-Cheers!

470
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:54,458
Sir, thanks to you, I fulfilled my dream.

471
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,708
I was able to narrate a story to a very big director.

472
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,541
But he didn’t give me a feedback 
on what he thought of my story.

473
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:01,958
Big directors tend to be that way.

474
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,083
If he readily agrees, how would that bode for him?

475
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:05,750
That’s true, sir.

476
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,875
Do you know what those big shot directors,

477
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,041
 producers and heroes do after you narrate your story to them?

478
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,416
They start picking it apart and finding flaws.

479
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,333
Do you think they feed their bodies?

480
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:17,791
They feed their egos.

481
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,208
Well, my director…he is exactly like you.

482
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,375
He used to constantly hover around me.

483
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,333
And with just one stroke of opportunity,

484
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,541
I changed his fate.

485
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:34,666
Don’t you worry.

486
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,583
I will take care of it.

487
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,708
Okay, sir.
Thank you.

488
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,750
Sir, can I brag about this outside?

489
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:43,625
Did you have to fart?

490
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,833
He’s been farting for sometime now.

491
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:47,666
And am I not tolerating it?

492
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:50,041
You need to be patient and calm…

493
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,958
…until it’s been officially announced.

494
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,291
As you say, sir.

495
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,666
You just forget about the rest.
Be assured that you are going to go places.

496
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,958
The other day, I spoke about you to Ram Charan.

497
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:05,833
Ram Charan?

498
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:06,583
What did you tell him?

499
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,958
I told him that I know of a good story writer.

500
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:09,791
What did he say?

501
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,833
Do you think he will disregard my suggestion?

502
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:12,958
He immediately asked me to 
bring you along for story narration.

503
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:13,583
Is that so, sir?

504
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:16,958
Well, even Mahesh Babu..
…he always consults me for everything.

505
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:18,458
I just spoke with him this morning.

506
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,250
I told Pawan Kalyan not to focus only on politics.

507
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,500
I advised him to do movies once in a while.
-Power star…

508
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:24,166
Is that so?

509
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,708
I called Mr. Dil Raju at once.

510
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,500
He was all excited and immediately started the project.

511
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,125
Pawan Kalyan?

512
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,458
You are just a hillbilly. 
You would find all this strange.

513
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:40,333
Mr. Chiranjeevi laid his arm on my shoulder
 and walked with me for half an hour and asked me for my advice.

514
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:43,083
He is going to be working on a new movie, right?

515
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,208
He asked me to suggest a director.

516
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:45,916
What did you tell him?

517
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,041
We mustn’t mention those things out loud.

518
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,000
Today, I had breakfast with Bunny.

519
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,458
Sir,

520
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,750
looks like you don’t follow social media.

521
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,708
Allu Arjun is at Ramoji Film studio.

522
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,583
Mr. Chiranjeevi is busy shooting for the movie Acharya.

523
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,583
Mahesh Babu’s gone on a holiday with his family.

524
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,000
These are all things they’ve posted on FaceBook.

525
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:10,708
You don’t know about all these things 
and keep dropping names

526
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,791
and spinning us yarn. Why do you do that?

527
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:14,500
Who is he?

528
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,333
He is my friend.
Please, sir. Don’t mind him.

529
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,416
You should have asked me this before
 I sat down for a drink.

530
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,250
Don’t ever call me for a drink when he is around.

531
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,333
Yeah, right?! You think you are some 
sexy lady that I’d come to meet?

532
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:30,208
You are quite poor but talk all big around town.
You and your stupid face.

533
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:30,791
Get up!

534
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:32,250
Who the hell is he?

535
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,416
Looks like a bear that’s escaped from the forests.

536
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,125
Wasn’t he taught to keep his manners 
when speaking to elders?

537
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,458
Sir…Sir…Sir…
-He just keeps talking nonsense!

538
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:40,250
Sir..sir…he is my friend.
When he’s a bit drunk, he spews nonsense.

539
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,958
Listen, don’t ever invite me to a party with such folk.

540
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,541
Get lost!
I’ve seen many of your kind!

541
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,125
Where do you stay? Which area?

542
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,500
I live in Srinagar Colony, Shivalayam.

543
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,958
Well, what’s your name?
-Balu Mahendra.

544
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:10,625
Do you drink?

545
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:12,125
Never mind me, sir.
You carry on.

546
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,583
I meant do you drink.

547
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:15,875
I do, sir.

548
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,333
But, having a drink with you would be inappropriate, sir.

549
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:17,958
That’s why.

550
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,333
Never mind all that. 

551
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,041
Let’s not be formal with each other.
What do you want?

552
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,916
I have vodka, whiskey, beer…
-Looks like this is inevitable.

553
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,333
Sir… I am okay with beer.

554
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,333
What’s this? Don’t you have any meat?

555
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,208
Nope.

556
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,125
Why don’t you order something online?

557
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:37,833
Thank you, sir.

558
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:44,041
Balu, tell me what you would like to have.I’ll order it for you.
-Cheers!

559
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,750
Oh goodness! Don’t bother with all that ma’am.
I will make do with what we have here.

560
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,750
Don’t worry. Tell me what you’d like to have.
I’ll place the order.

561
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,916
Don’t be shy. Just say what you want to eat.

562
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,333
You are very persistent, sir.

563
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,791
Prawns Biryani, please.

564
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,250
I will order fish for you. Is that okay?

565
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:03,500
Balu?
-Sir.

566
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,791
I really like the story that you narrated yesterday.

567
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:07,875
Thank you, sir.

568
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:11,666
We need to make a few changes to that.

569
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,166
Of course, sir. Let’s do that.

570
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,375
If people like you suggest those changes, 
they elevate the story.

571
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,333
Most definitely yes.

572
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,708
It’s quite a big deal that my husband liked your story.

573
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:23,208
That’s ‘cause he never hired any writer ever.

574
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:25,791
He wrote all of his stories.
You must know that.

575
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,791
Of course, who wouldn’t know about his work?

576
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,708
Well… he is the top dog when it comes to writing stories…

577
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:33,250
…his dialogues, the jokes…

578
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:34,458
Stop it!

579
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:37,750
Well, what are you expecting?

580
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,791
In terms of cash…

581
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:42,083
You are being very straight forward, sir.

582
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,125
Five lakhs, sir.

583
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,833
I will give you ten lakhs...Okay?

584
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,291
You are really awesome, sir.

585
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:58,458
Thank you, sir.

586
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:03,708
Don’t be so excited.
You will not be credited for this work.

587
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,666
Sir…
Why would you do that?

588
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,625
Reduce my pay but give me the credit, sir.

589
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:12,958
Balu…

590
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:16,500
I don’t think you understand the problem here.

591
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,000
Take fifteen lakhs and just let the rights go.

592
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:22,750
Sir…. I’ve lost a lot of stories like this…

593
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,083
and haven’t been credited for my work.

594
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,208
Everywhere I go, I have to start afresh 

595
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:27,541
because I don’t have a body of credited work 
to reference.

596
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,125
This is a huge obstacle for me.

597
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,583
Well, I need money too but…
…but I need to be credited even more.

598
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,875
Please, sir.
Please give me the credit for the story.

599
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,458
All these years, I had my name up
 there on the silver screen.

600
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,875
Do you think it’s easy to replace my name with yours?

601
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,166
You’ll not get it.

602
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:44,291
I will pay you 25 lakhs.

603
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,458
Just let it go.

604
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,208
Sir, you are a very big name in the industry.

605
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:51,583
If I am credited in your work, 
it will completely change my life, sir.

606
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:54,833
After that, I wouldn’t even need to
to haggle for ten or twenty lakhs.

607
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,458
Balu, what you say is right but…

608
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,083
Hey! Hold on!

609
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,583
Who the hell is he?
Doesn’t he understand what’s being told?

610
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,500
Opportunity does not knock on your door frequently.

611
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,666
Think before you speak.

612
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:08,708
No, sir. I am very clear on this.

613
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:11,958
No matter how many years I put in, it’s all for fame.

614
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,875
I want fame and I want to uphold your reputation too.

615
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:16,791
Everything comes down to credit, sir.

616
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,708
Work on this movie with him.

617
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,125
Take whatever amount of salary you want.

618
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:25,458
You can make your next movie under 
our banner for sure.

619
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:26,875
What do you say?
Are you okay with it?

620
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,041
Please, ma’am. I’ve heard this excuse many times 
and was cheated many times by such words.

621
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,625
I don’t want to do it.

622
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,333
Alright, what if we say no?
What are you going to do then?

623
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,333
25 lakhs.

624
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,041
You said you need that money.

625
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:47,333
You need to think.

626
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,916
Are you couple trying to confuse me?

627
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,291
Who doesn’t need money?

628
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:58,125
I need money, I need fame and beyond that,
he needs me.

629
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,375
I think you know what people think of him now.

630
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,083
Bastard!

631
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,000
You are not even worthy of standing in front of me?

632
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,125
And you claim that I need you?!

633
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:21,000
I will kill you!

634
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,666
Raghu! Don’t.

635
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,708
First, check on him.

636
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,166
First, check on him.

637
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:37,333
What happened?

638
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,708
Raghu, tell me. What happened to him?

639
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:45,291
Tell me.

640
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,541
He is dead.

641
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,833
De..Dead?

642
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,458
What do we do now?

643
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,583
You ruined our lives in a matter of a minute.

644
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:04,125
Oh dear! All those police, the case….
what’s all this Raghu?

645
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:06,208
Why did you need to do this?

646
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,250
Let me think!

647
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:10,750
It’s already done!

648
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:13,708
Your anger is responsible for this!

649
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,166
Who could that be?

650
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,541
I will check.

651
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,708
Who is it?
Food delivery.

652
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:39,000
What are you doing?
First, we need to hide the body.

653
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,458
I am taking it to the other room.

654
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:05,875
Sir, parcel sir.

655
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,125
Thanks.
Sir, give me a rating.

656
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:07,625
Fine, I’ll do that.

657
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:08,875
Give me five stars on the rating, sir.

658
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:10,083
I told you that I’ll do it.
Please, sir…

659
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:10,625
Sir! Sir! Sir!

660
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,000
Is he gone?

661
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,333
Raghu, are you mad?

662
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,583
You do know what happened here, right?
And you are happily drinking away!

663
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:33,375
Raghu!
I am talking to you.

664
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,541
The DIG is my friend.
I will talk to him.

665
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:37,833
Police? DIG?

666
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,916
Wouldn’t that be a problem?

667
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,833
I told you that he’s my friend.

668
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,541
He will help me.

669
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:43,375
Where is the phone?

670
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:46,500
I wonder what’s going to happen.
Phone? It’s there.

671
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,041
Why did I have to call the writer…
..and why did the writer narrate the story…

672
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,416
…and why did he get angry.

673
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,250
I intended something else and 
what happened was entirely different.

674
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,583
Oh god! The police and courts…
What’s going to happen to us?! 

675
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,791
First, drink this.
I don’t want this, Raghu.

676
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:58,708
You will be a bit braver after drinking this.

677
00:38:58,875 --> 00:38:59,791
Drink.

678
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,875
What happened?
-He isn’t picking up the call.

679
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,291
What do we do now?

680
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:13,708
I will have to go and meet him.

681
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:14,916
I will accompany you.

682
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:15,458
No!

683
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:18,291
If the both of us go there, 
it would seem like we did this together.

684
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,541
It isn’t safe for you to come there.

685
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,083
I shouldn’t involve you in this.

686
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:21,916
I will handle this.

687
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:22,541
You just stay here.

688
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:23,875
Oh dear! 
Raghu! Raghu!

689
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:26,625
He is inside and I am here.
How can I be alone here at this time?

690
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:27,541
Please try and understand.

691
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:29,833
He is dead, right?

692
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:30,833
Why are you scared?

693
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,375
Just wait for an hour.
I’ll be back before the hour’s up.

694
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,958
Husband…please try and understand this.

695
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,208
I cannot stay alone.

696
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,541
I’ll just stay in the car.

697
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,208
Just do as you are told!

698
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:41,083
Sit down!

699
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:42,375
Go and sit down!

700
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,291
I am locking the door behind me.

701
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,041
No one would come.
Why are you scared?

702
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:03,958
Raghu!
Raghu!

703
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,416
He…He is still moving about here.

704
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:09,041
Who?

705
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:09,958
He…
What?

706
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:10,541
Balu

707
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,375
he tried to kill me.

708
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,833
He is still here.
-What are you talking about?He died, right?

709
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:17,208
I put his body in that room.

710
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:18,833
No, he is still alive.

711
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,500
If we are in here, he is going to kill us.

712
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:22,958
Don’t be scared and anxious. 

713
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:23,666
What are you talking about?

714
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:25,750
No, Raghu.
He is going to kill us.

715
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,583
I am scared…scared.
Cool! Cool! Cool!

716
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,666
Chill! Relax.

717
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:30,166
I am here with you, right?
I will take care of it.

718
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:32,791
Ra…Raghu.

719
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,333
She is dead.

720
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,208
Heart Attack. Natural death.

721
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:39,625
You leave.

722
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:41,791
I will call you later.

723
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:09,291
Hello?
Ambulance?

724
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:52,375
Babu?
-Subbu.

725
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:55,250
How do I get there from here?
-Babu, take the straight and immediate left.

726
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:56,333
From the temple?

727
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,000
Yes, Babu.

728
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,083
Yes, that’s the one.

729
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,125
Okay, I’m coming out.

730
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:00,875
Okay.

731
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:04,375
The hero is coming here.
I will escort him in.

732
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:05,625
Go and get him.
-Okay.

733
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:11,125
Did you pay him the advance for this month?

734
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:13,250
I paid him 50 before the release of this movie.

735
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:14,750
He’s already has two flops.

736
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:17,208
How long would it take him to get out of this funk
and when will you make a movie with him?

737
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:18,666
I don’t know.
Let’s wait and watch.

738
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:25,791
Namaste, Babu.
-Namaste.

739
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:27,583
Namaste, Babu.
-Namaste.

740
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:37,666
Namaste, Babu.
-Namaste.

741
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:50,583
Be brave.
We will meet again.

742
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:09,166
Sir, do you want me to stay?

743
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,416
No need.

744
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:15,250
Come tomorrow.

745
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:18,166
Okay, sir.

746
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,083
Hi, sir.

747
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,333
Has everyone left?

748
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:36,000
I need to speak to you.

749
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:38,916
Let’s go inside and talk.

750
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:44,791
You seem to have gotten very busy these days.

751
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,250
Not more than you.

752
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:49,791
You got a notice to pay tax for your Gandipet property.

753
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,625
Finish that.

754
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,458
Let’s finish that in a day or two.

755
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:00,375
Alright. What’s the matter?

756
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,708
While coming here, I got the death 
certificate from the hospital.

757
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:05,458
All the formalities are done.

758
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:08,375
I need your signature on some insurance documents.

759
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,166
Well, to transfer the properties from Maya’s name to yours, 

760
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,916
we need a nominee.

761
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:15,791
Do you have anyone in mind?

762
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:18,333
Why? Can’t this be done without nominating someone?

763
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:21,625
Nothing of that sort.
But, someone or the other must be a nominee.

764
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:25,500
If you give me those details, everything 
will be taken care of in two weeks.

765
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,375
I’ll inform you after giving it some thought.

766
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,416
Well, according to the current market value, 
what’s the estimated worth?

767
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,958
Approximately, 150 crores.

768
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:39,333
Why?

769
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,541
Nothing.

770
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:44,250
I need one crore in cash by tomorrow.

771
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,291
I’ll arrange for it.

772
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,958
Why? Are you purchasing something?

773
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,541
Nothing of that sort.
Just arrange the money.

774
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:50,583
I forgot to tell you.

775
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:53,083
We got new stock from abroad.
Do you want me to send it to you?

776
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,875
Nope. I was thinking of going abroad.

777
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:59,291
No, don’t leave yet. There’s a lot 
of things to be taken care of here.

778
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,083
After we are done with things here, 
you can go abroad at a more leisurely pace.

779
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,291
Didn’t you tell me that I 
needed to sign something?

780
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:05,416
Here.

781
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:22,166
 Alright, I shall leave.
-Okay.

782
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,416
Cheers!

783
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,458
Be careful!

784
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:47,000
Even when I made my first movie a success, 
I didn’t experience this sort of happiness.

785
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,166
You are an important reason for it.

786
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:51,708
You did a good job.

787
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:53,708
Well, it’s no biggie, sir.

788
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:56,166
I executed the plan in the exact manner
 that you instructed me to.

789
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:57,666
At last, I hope you are happy.

790
00:52:58,083 --> 00:52:58,708
I am happy.

791
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:01,666
Your happiness is behind you.

792
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:03,250
Take it.

793
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:08,208
Money is a very clever thing.

794
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,791
The person who needs it cannot see it.

795
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:14,833
But it keeps entertaining those who are well-fed.

796
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:17,500
In a way, money is like a woman.

797
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:20,541
When we love a woman, 
she doesn’t give us the attention.

798
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:21,833
But when she falls in love with us, 

799
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:24,000
even though we repel her, she wouldn’t leave us.

800
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:34,375
Even though you messaged me many times,
 I did not reply.

801
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:39,875
But that day, when you sent me the synopsis,

802
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:43,833
I was in a bit of a shock.

803
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:50,375
The content of your story was pretty 
similar to what I had planned.

804
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:51,666
So, 

805
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,208
So, you are very close to my thought process.
-Thank you.

806
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:57,750
That is why I enquired about you.

807
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,916
What’s up, director? Do you have some work with me?

808
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,375
I sent you a number.

809
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:11,000
I need all the details regarding that person.

810
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,291
Tell me, lawyer.

811
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:21,708
His name is Balu Mahendra.

812
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:23,083
He doesn’t have a lot going for him.

813
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:25,875
He is the writer for all the good movies 
that have been released in recent times.

814
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:28,041
Everyone used him and left him.

815
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:30,666
I got to know that he was not paid well.

816
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,333
That is why he is trying to become a director.

817
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:34,666
He has all the possible bad habits.

818
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:36,583
Especially, his need for money.

819
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:42,000
If you get him to sign a 3 movie deal, 
it would be beneficial.

820
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,083
I will take care of it.

821
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:51,125
He is the correct choice for killing my wife.

822
00:54:57,291 --> 00:54:58,750
Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

823
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:05,500
I read the movie you sent me.

824
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:06,500
It’s very good.

825
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,083
Thank you, sir.

826
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:10,041
Sit down.

827
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,208
What are your plans?

828
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:17,791
I want to be a director, sir.

829
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:22,333
What will I get out of making you a director?

830
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:25,625
Sir, give me one chance.

831
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:26,916
Just one chance.

832
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:28,833
I will obey you all my life.

833
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:33,666
Alright.
There is a bag on that table.

834
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:35,333
That bag.

835
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,166
Bring it here.

836
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:42,416
Open it.

837
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:51,833
There is a photo in that bag. Take it out.

838
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:57,958
She is beautiful.

839
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:00,541
You must portray the Sampath character in your story.

840
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:03,458
She will portray Ramya.

841
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:05,458
She is gorgeous.

842
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,458
She fits the bill perfectly.

843
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,125
Don’t be too excited.

844
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:12,250
That is my wife.

845
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,958
Even then, she suits the character well.

846
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:20,250
What you need to do it is to portray 
the character in reality.

847
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:22,291
What?

848
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,291
You mean…are you saying…

849
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,000
The climax in your story.

850
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,916
Sir, I won’t be able to do such things.

851
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:39,208
It’s all okay in the movies but…

852
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,541
I cannot do this. 
I’m sorry.

853
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:45,041
Listen, you’ve spent six years in this industry.

854
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:46,375
What did you achieve?

855
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,083
In this field, no one does anyone any favors for free.

856
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,583
I will back you up.

857
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:56,041
Wherever you go, you can use my name.

858
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:58,166
Think it over.

859
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,875
I know that you need money.

860
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,708
There is ten million in that bag.

861
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:05,750
After the deed is done, 
I’ll give you another ten million.

862
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:09,583
I don’t care if you want to make 
movies or just while away your talent.

863
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:13,916
Well…I need money but…

864
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,500
Listen,

865
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:18,208
 will you take this bag and go out...

866
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:21,625
or..are you going to go out and keep messaging people?

867
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,916
Hundreds of people like you message me everyday.

868
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:30,500
Writer, use your creativity.

869
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,708
The offer is open only for 24 hours from now.

870
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:36,083
The bag’s waiting for you.

871
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:50,791
Hello?

872
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:59,125
Well… I am scared that I will be 
caught in this plan of yours.

873
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:01,416
If you get caught, I will be caught too.

874
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,416
That is why, you don’t need to be anxious.

875
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:06,166
I will take care of everything.

876
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:12,833
Alright, as I told you earlier,

877
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:17,125
the offer stands only until tomorrow evening.

878
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:18,750
Got it?

879
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,750
Balu… it’s his house and his wife.

880
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:29,166
If something goes wrong, he will be the 
one to land in prison first.

881
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,458
Ten million rupees… 

882
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:33,833
And after the deed’s done, another ten million.

883
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:37,458
If all goes well, you can make a million.

884
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:41,208
But if it goes south, you can claim that 
you were trying to be real with the story.

885
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,666
So, you would bag another ten million.

886
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:45,916
Either ways, I’m safe.

887
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:47,208
Do it.

888
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:58,666
Smart boy.

889
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:01,833
When do we start? 

890
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:05,375
I’ll tell you.

891
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:08,875
Until then, relax a bit.

892
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:13,333
Spend a little from this amount on that manager.

893
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:15,750
He will get you to me.

894
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,458
Sir, you can leave that to me.

895
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:19,500
I will take care of the business of approaching you.

896
00:59:20,916 --> 00:59:21,833
All the best.

897
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:31,250
Everything’s fine, sir.

898
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,333
But the person inside me is itching to ask you a question.

899
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:34,916
May I?

900
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:37,083
You already made up your mind to ask me. Go ahead.

901
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:41,625
You killed your wife for her wealth, right?

902
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,083
That money is mine.

903
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:57,083
What does that mean?

904
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:00,833
You mean, it doesn’t belong to her.

905
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:05,166
Sir, the person inside me is being a big bother.

906
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:06,791
Please clarify it for me.

907
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:13,333
Five years ago, that hotel’s name Hyatt…

908
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:19,625
When will you cast me in your movie?

909
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:23,166
In my next movie, I will definitely cast you.

910
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:24,125
I promise.

911
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:27,291
You’ve been postponing that for three years.

912
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:30,625
I am forced to compromise on a lot of
 things because of working with new male leads.

913
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:32,166
I am not unable to take it, baby.

914
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,208
Riya,

915
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:38,000
if you are cast opposite a big star, 
you would look like a newbie.

916
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,958
If you already work with big stars, 
what are you going to do next?

917
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:44,458
I want you to have a long career in this industry.

918
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:46,958
I will guarantee that.

919
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:51,750
When you talk, my heart is filled with joy.

920
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,916
You said that your heart is happy.
What about mine then?

921
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,791
It must be room service,

922
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:40,666
I’ll take a look.

923
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:48,416
Maya?

924
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:56,416
Maya…what are you doing here?

925
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:19,041
Maya…Maya…Maya…please.

926
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:20,250
Don’t touch me.

927
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,666
Looking at you is filling me with disgust.

928
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:40,208
Maya…

929
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:49,875
I don’t have any such sort of intentions.

930
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:52,708
She called me for her birthday party.

931
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:54,125
That is why I went there.

932
01:02:56,125 --> 01:03:02,000
I was blinded… I didn’t know what was happening…

933
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:06,125
Thinking back on it, I am disgusted!

934
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:10,791
You know about me.

935
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,958
Did I ever behave this way?

936
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:17,708
Please, Maya.

937
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:21,875
Please, Maya.

938
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,000
Please don’t look at me like that.

939
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:26,083
I am not able to take it.

940
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,583
I should have taken you to that birthday party.

941
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:34,083
My stupid fate!

942
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:38,583
I just wanted to make an appearance for two minutes.

943
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:40,916
And in that span… 

944
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:45,916
I should have controlled myself!

945
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,416
I should have! I should have!

946
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:52,708
I was foolish.

947
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,625
The girl was interested in me…

948
01:03:56,166 --> 01:04:00,208
and as a man, I couldn’t control my baser urges…

949
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:03,833
It’s my fault.

950
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:06,375
I made a mistake.

951
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,708
I made a mistake.

952
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:10,708
I made a mistake.

953
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:12,416
I made a mistake.

954
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:19,791
Have you gone mad?

955
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:22,291
You’ve wronged me and now you do this?

956
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:24,666
Look at how you’re bleeding.

957
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:26,916
Wait here. I’ll get the first aid kit.

958
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,708
Oh dear…shall we go to the hospital?
Look at how you’re bleeding.

959
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,583
No.
It doesn’t matter.

960
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:10,208
I’ve hurt a goddess such as you.
I deserve this pain.

961
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:15,666
I am ashamed to ask for your forgiveness.

962
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,375
Water…
Wait, I’ll get you some water.

963
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:39,833
Here.

964
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:54,500
Sorry, Maya.

965
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,458
I will never do this ever again.

966
01:05:58,625 --> 01:05:59,416
Please forgive me.

967
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:01,666
I will never do this again.

968
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,416
If you repeat this, it would get ugly.

969
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:06,583
Do you understand this?

970
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,250
Can I trust you?

971
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:16,875
Tell me, Raghu. Tell me!

972
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,708
Hi, baby.

973
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,583
How are you?

974
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,375
Whiskey or Brandy?

975
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,375
You are giving me a much better high than those.

976
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:49,666
You look amazing, baby.

977
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,916
I made this special mix for you.

978
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:59,208
Taste it and tell me how it is.
-Thanks.

979
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,625
Why don’t you cast me as a female
 lead in your movie?

980
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:08,375
For sure, baby.

981
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,708
Wow! I am excited about that.

982
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:13,625
How long will you work around talentless actors?

983
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:16,291
You must do a heroine centric movie

984
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:19,083
Like Nayantara, Jejamma and Anushka.

985
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:26,625
The story is about a porn star who
 struggled all her life and sacrificed a lot.

986
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:29,541
Title is Varalaksmi.

987
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:30,583
How is it?

988
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,625
How do you get such ideas, baby?

989
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:35,416
How, you ask?

990
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:48,916
Now look at it from my perspective. 
The world will seem bigger.

991
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:56,166
At times, when we do something like this.
Such kind of thoughts simply flow into my mind.

992
01:07:57,583 --> 01:08:04,625
These days, I learnt a lot of new 
angles from my mentor.

993
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:11,750
I learnt where to place the camera for more visual pleasure.

994
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:16,666
You are not simply talented.
You are in an altogether different league.

995
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:19,333
You are a dangerous player!

996
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:00,916
Sir, is there anyone who wouldn’t fall for your charm?

997
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:06,166
It’s true that you’ve conquered such fan
 base in two states with your magical words.

998
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,333
Charming women is not such a big deal for you.

999
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:10,625
I used to think the same. 

1000
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:11,625
But…

1001
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:14,875
What happened?

1002
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:16,000
Did you get caught again?

1003
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,041
No.

1004
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,666
Well then, what happened?

1005
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,125
The movie I was supposed to cast her in was cancelled.

1006
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:27,708
The previous girl continued see me.

1007
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:32,125
You mean the girl you were 
caught in the hotel with?

1008
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:39,250
My wife wanted kids and so, embarked on a mission

1009
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,833
Did you not know seeds don’t grow 
when you plant them in other’s gardens?

1010
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:50,208
You should have told your wife.

1011
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:55,125
Writer…just because we are drinking, 
don’t be a loose cannon.

1012
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,625
Okay, okay.
Sorry, sir.

1013
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:59,041
Tell me…tell me.
The story’s getting interesting now sir.

1014
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:01,333
Alright, where did we stop?

1015
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:04,208
The fire prayers.

1016
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:11,708
(Chanting of sacred verses in Sanskrit)

1017
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:35,833
It’s not important.

1018
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,666
Very soon, you will be blessed with a child.

1019
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,791
I bless that you have a child soon.

1020
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,125
May your heart’s desire come true.

1021
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:18,458
Oh, my goodness! That priest!

1022
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,583
On the one hand, he gave her a fruit and 
On the other hand, he blessed you with a child.

1023
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:23,666
What do you mean? 
Are you being sarcastic?

1024
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:26,625
No, sir. The twist in the tale is superb.
I didn’t expect that at all.

1025
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:27,958
You think so?

1026
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:30,458
A lot of people call it destiny.

1027
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:32,750
You are no ordinary man.

1028
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,291
You are going to get out of it somehow.

1029
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,666
Why would you think that?

1030
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,000
Didn’t you understand the situation properly?

1031
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,583
Or did I not explain it well?

1032
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:40,583
No, sir.

1033
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:45,625
The audience have really connected with your story and
so, the expectations run high.

1034
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,791
Sorry, sir.

1035
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:50,708
I mean…
What happened further down?

1036
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:51,750
It’s very exciting.

1037
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:56,083
What else? My wife had a heart attack
 and there was a show down at the hospital.

1038
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:01,875
Were you planning on killing our daughter?

1039
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:06,791
We’ve all assumed that you were a good man.
But your actions speak differently.

1040
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:08,833
Hush now, uncle.

1041
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:11,958
We mustn’t wash our dirty laundry in the public.

1042
01:12:11,958 --> 01:12:12,916
What went wrong?

1043
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:14,541
What else can go wrong?

1044
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,708
I am the one who’s praying for kids
and his mistresses are giving birth to those kids.

1045
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:20,666
How can I trust him?

1046
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:25,666
I don’t know whether to divorce him
 or to commit suicide.

1047
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:27,583
Why speak so harshly, dear?

1048
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:29,125
He likes you a lot.

1049
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:30,583
Just calm down and think it over.

1050
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:32,166
What else is there to think calmly?

1051
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,291
Since it’s my daughter, 
she was patient with him.

1052
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,625
If it was someone else, she would have taken him to the streets
and created a huge furore.

1053
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:41,708
What do you want me to do uncle?
That is probably my fate.

1054
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:46,500
Dear, during these times, 
aggression will not do. Calm down a bit.

1055
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:48,166
I am here for you.

1056
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:51,875
If something goes wrong, I will skin him.

1057
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:55,875
If things like this leak out, 
our family’s reputation would be ruined.

1058
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:59,166
If the media gets a wind of this, 
they will turn it into an ugly mess.

1059
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:04,000
Divorce…I don’t think it’s the right
 time for the both of you to talk about it.

1060
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:07,750
And regarding the other woman, we will talk to her.

1061
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,333
We will try and convince her 
and pack her off to some foreign country.

1062
01:13:11,958 --> 01:13:13,708
He would have no choice but to listen to you.

1063
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:23,791
Only women are capable of tolerating 
and being patient with the any kind of scoundrel.

1064
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:28,291
My brother might not be a saint but I know
 that he is not a monster.

1065
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:33,500
From now on, he will listen to you and stay by your side.
Okay?

1066
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:39,625
I am scared that some child might
 come and claim to be the heirs of our property.

1067
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,375
If that happens, what kind of a situation would I be in?

1068
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:45,625
What is going to happen to the 
children I would be having with him?

1069
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,166
On what grounds should I continue to stay with him?

1070
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,333
She is demanding answers. Answer her!

1071
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:52,833
I mean…well…

1072
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:54,708
He is going to put the entire property under your name.

1073
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:57,208
From now on, you take care of the financing.

1074
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,750
In a marriage, the wife has more
 responsibilities than her husband.

1075
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:02,166
It would be better that way too.

1076
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:07,333
So what if the entire property is under my name?
 Would that change his behavior?

1077
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:10,916
Even an aggressive bull can be 
controlled by covering its eyes.

1078
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:15,083
Every rupee that he’s going to spend from now on, 
has to be given by you

1079
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:17,416
and he needs to account his spending to you.
I will get those papers ready.

1080
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,041
Your wish, uncle.

1081
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:22,625
If something like this happens again,
 I will not listen to anyone.

1082
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,041
Happens again?

1083
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:27,375
Don’t entertain unnecessary 
thoughts and put your life in danger, dear.

1084
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:28,791
Try to be calm, dear.

1085
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,291
What are you looking at?
Come out. I want to talk to you.

1086
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:44,625
It took you a lot of effort to come to this position.

1087
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,666
We thought you are all settled…and now this nonsense?

1088
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:50,541
Even though you are big shot director, 
you are still immature.

1089
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:54,083
Use that head of yours for productive things.

1090
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,708
Not always on your libido!

1091
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,750
That day, they didn’t just give her keys to my kingdom.

1092
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:08,416
They caught me in a trap.

1093
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:26,000
Repeat. Sorry, sir.
-We’ve run out of that product.

1094
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:29,541
Fine, get me the bill.

1095
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:30,583
Sir bill.

1096
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:44,708
Sir, it’s been declined. 

1097
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,166
What? Check again.

1098
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:52,333
Sir, it’s getting declined.
If you have another card, please give it.

1099
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:55,166
Try this.

1100
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:01,000
Sir, it’s the same. Declined.

1101
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,458
What?
-It’s been declined.

1102
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:07,666
What? How can my card be declined?

1103
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:09,500
Here, take this.
-Okay, sir.

1104
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:11,416
It will definitely work.

1105
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:14,958
No, sir. It’s been declined.

1106
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,041
Wait a minute.

1107
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:23,333
Sir…sir…
Tell me, sir.

1108
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:24,583
My cards aren’t working.

1109
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:26,291
They keep declining.

1110
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:27,750
Check what’s happening.

1111
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:32,291
Well, sir. I don’t know why but 
your wife had blocked all your cards.

1112
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:36,916
What? What the hell?
What are you saying?

1113
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:40,000
That’s true, sir. Your wife instructed
 them to block all your cards.

1114
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:45,791
What’s the problem?

1115
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:47,458
All his cards have been declined.

1116
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:48,916
It’s okay, sir.

1117
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:51,791
You are a regular customer. We will take care of it later.
You can leave, sir.

1118
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:53,791
Sorry.

1119
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:06,458
Maya! Maya! Maya!

1120
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,000
Why did you block my cards?

1121
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:12,708
Why do you keep involving yourself in my affairs?

1122
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,458
I was humiliated in front of everyone.

1123
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:18,041
Your stupid antics have cost me my reputation.

1124
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:20,250
Couldn’t you have consulted me 
before you did something?

1125
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,833
Are you going to do as you please?

1126
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:27,416
Hey! I am shouting at the top of my lungs here.
Do you think this is a joke?

1127
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:29,750
Do you take me for a fool?

1128
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:33,166
Why are you involving yourself in my business?

1129
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:34,666
This is my lifestyle.

1130
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:36,250
Hey! I was talking to you.

1131
01:17:39,666 --> 01:17:43,958
The monthly bill for all your alcohol 
and shenanigans is three hundred thousand.

1132
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:46,666
Do you need to spend this much on your lifestyle?

1133
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:51,250
You entertain all sorts of idiots at your office.
You think I don’t know what you’re up to.

1134
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,333
And you keep shouting at me!

1135
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:55,166
Do you think only you can yell? 
Don’t you think I can do the same?

1136
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:59,666
It’s my wish.I will drink, yell and do
whatsoever that pleases me.Why bother?

1137
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:03,250
Really? So, you are going to be the way that pleases you?

1138
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:05,541
Then, why I am here? You think I’m worthless?!

1139
01:18:05,916 --> 01:18:07,500
I am your wife.

1140
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,666
I won’t just watch you do as you please.

1141
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:11,541
I have a code too.

1142
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:13,166
Who wants your stupid code?!

1143
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,708
I was this way before you entered my life.

1144
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:16,125
I am going to live this way even
 after you’ve entered my life.

1145
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:19,000
This sofa, chair and table are all here 
because I prefer it that way.

1146
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:22,083
The same is the case with you.
Just be like them and stay mute.

1147
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:24,291
If not, I will throw you out!

1148
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,375
You are going to throw me out?!

1149
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,625
Do that! Do that! Do that!

1150
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,208
You can’t do it, right?

1151
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:37,666
It’s not possible.

1152
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:40,958
Why are you laughing like that?

1153
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:42,541
Are you crazy?

1154
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:47,458
Listen, if you talk too much, I don’t have to put up with you.

1155
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:48,666
I will divorce you.

1156
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:49,250
Get out!

1157
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:52,875
Let’s do this, Raghu Ram.

1158
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,958
Get two women…

1159
01:18:55,041 --> 01:18:56,708
If that’s not enough, get another one more.

1160
01:18:56,708 --> 01:19:01,541
Do whatever you please.
And I’m just going to cheer you on. Okay?

1161
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:06,333
What? Don’t you want to?

1162
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:08,958
Let’s do something else.

1163
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:11,500
Remember that TV show, ‘Life is a bullock cart ride’.

1164
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:13,708
Let’s go to that show and air our dirty laundry.

1165
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:19,083
“My husband betrayed me! My husband betrayed me!”
I am going to cry about it like that in that show.

1166
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:19,916
Would that be okay, Raghu Ram?

1167
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,791
If you divorce me, you would be the one leaving this house.

1168
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:30,208
Not me.

1169
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,833
This house and this entire property is mine.

1170
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:36,041
Decide if you want to stay or leave.

1171
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:44,958
After that, I felt like someone was writing with my hands,
someone else was making my feet move

1172
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:46,666
Everything changed.

1173
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:52,083
Those are my hands but I am not the one writing the script.

1174
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:56,000
I am walking but the path is not mine.

1175
01:19:57,416 --> 01:19:59,291
At once, everything changed.

1176
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:04,625
I worked hard since I was 19 years old.
I got to this position after a long struggle.

1177
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:08,208
Not because I married her or because of their suggestions.

1178
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,791
How could she have given me a new lease of life?

1179
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:13,708
She merely entered my life.

1180
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,625
When she wanted to go grocery shopping at the market, 
 I bought her a Range Rover.

1181
01:20:18,916 --> 01:20:23,208
And if I wanted a cigarette, 
I had to ask her for money.

1182
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:26,333
Being in prison affords better freedom than this, 
I suppose.

1183
01:20:30,416 --> 01:20:33,000
Murdering someone because of such anger is quite justified.

1184
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:34,791
Well,

1185
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:38,916
unlike Puri Jagannath, do you anyone
 can reclaim their lost wealth?

1186
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:40,416
You are right, sir.

1187
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:49,250
What is that?

1188
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:52,791
Sir…sir…please don’t take it the wrong way.

1189
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:55,875
I generally have the habit of recording 
people I’m in conversation with.

1190
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:56,625
What does that mean?

1191
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,250
You recorded everything.

1192
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:03,583
I don’t know if you remember the
 flashback in the story I narrated to you.

1193
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:05,166
It’s not that good.

1194
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:08,333
But, if we were to substitute this in the flashback…
…the movie would be a super success.

1195
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:11,333
Stop with your nonsense and delete that first.

1196
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,458
And forget about the rest.

1197
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:15,708
Why would you think of making this into a movie?

1198
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:18,083
If this gets leaked, I am not the only 
one who will end up in jail.

1199
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:19,666
You would be there along with me.

1200
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,291
Sir, for general public, people in the 
movie industry are merely the fodder for gossip.

1201
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:28,333
They don’t have the patience nor the
 imagination to link the real-life events to those on the screen.

1202
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,375
Take it easy.

1203
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:30,875
Do you take me for a fool?

1204
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:33,625
Don’t you get it?

1205
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,083
Delete that!

1206
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:38,916
Okay, sir. I will delete it.

1207
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:43,458
Not just this, I won’t even make that movie.

1208
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:46,791
Sir…what did I want to make a movie for..

1209
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,666
Or why did you want to murder your wife?

1210
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:52,666
What was all that for?
Wasn’t it for money?

1211
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:56,083
Give me 50 crores.

1212
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,708
Are you blackmailing me?

1213
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,083
You said it yourself, sir. 

1214
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:02,958
Opportunity doesn’t knock on our door often.

1215
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:05,208
And you would blackmail me just because
 you have an opportunity to do so?

1216
01:22:06,583 --> 01:22:09,291
Stop teasing me, sir.
Those kinds of dialogues are for the movies.

1217
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:10,833
Who trusted you?

1218
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,916
You’ve turned my necessities into your needs.

1219
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:14,791
And because of that, you ended up with 150 crores.

1220
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:17,166
Give me 50 crores.
What’s wrong with that?

1221
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:20,916
I worked hard on the plan.
You came in and just acted for a few minutes.

1222
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:22,708
You want 50 crores for that?

1223
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:25,166
If not you, I would have found hundreds of people like you.

1224
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:28,375
What is it? You just quote the amount 
without any thought, huh?

1225
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:32,208
Oh god! You keep insisting that you 
were the one who did the whole thing.

1226
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:33,208
What did you do?

1227
01:22:33,541 --> 01:22:34,750
I was the one who planned it.

1228
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:37,625
You turned my script into your plan.

1229
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,166
Just give me 50 crores without any protest.
I shall leave from here.

1230
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,916
Just because I’ve been caught, 
you think you can take advantage of me?

1231
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,083
Bastard!

1232
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:47,000
Chandini

1233
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:49,333
you’ve come at the right time.

1234
01:25:53,416 --> 01:25:54,750
Take me to the hospital.

1235
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:59,375
Call the ambulance.

1236
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:01,500
Please.

1237
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,625
Help me…please.

1238
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:14,791
Why are you looking at me like that?

1239
01:26:18,708 --> 01:26:20,416
Maya is dead.

1240
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:28,375
Who else do I have besides you?

1241
01:26:31,666 --> 01:26:33,916
Do you know something?

1242
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:39,625
I put you as the nominee for all my wealth.

1243
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:46,708
You…you do know…how much …
I like you, right?

1244
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:56,458
If someone like me is in your life, 
think about how big you can make it in life.

1245
01:26:57,791 --> 01:26:59,083
Everything will be changed.

1246
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,416
I cannot take it anymore.

1247
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:06,791
Please,

1248
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:10,875
take me to the hospital.

1249
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:14,625
Chandini…please.

1250
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:18,333
Help me.

1251
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:24,083
Help me, please.

1252
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:25,625
You want help?

1253
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:30,875
Sir, I heard everything.

1254
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:35,250
You can convince anyone.

1255
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:40,125
Anyone who isn’t convinced by your words, isn’t a human!

1256
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:44,625
You are not just a creator;
You are a big criminal.

1257
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:51,000
Just because your wife nagged you about your lifestyle, 
You killed her. 

1258
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:53,666
And now, you killed him too…

1259
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:59,250
What about tomorrow?

1260
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:02,666
Honestly speaking, you are not selfish.

1261
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:05,291
You are the epitome of selfishness!

1262
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:09,166
Are all men like you?

1263
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:15,083
This fellow…this dirty scoundrel took advantage
of me by proclaiming that he’s in love with me.

1264
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:20,916
And you… I needed to sleep with you to work for you.

1265
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:23,208
I must sleep, right?

1266
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:26,583
Forgive me, Chandini.

1267
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:28,916
Don’t we have a personality of our own?

1268
01:28:30,916 --> 01:28:33,958
Just because I want to work, you turn me into a slut?

1269
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:38,791
Please…Chandini.

1270
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:43,416
Tell me a good reason why I must keep you alive?

1271
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:46,625
If you do, I will help you.

1272
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:49,958
Go on.
Hurry…Hurry.

1273
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:51,125
Think fast. You don’t have a lot of time.

1274
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,250
Right?

1275
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,916
A person like you wouldn’t get a better death than this.

1276
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:05,083
Just die!

1277
01:29:05,666 --> 01:29:06,750
That’s the best.

1278
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:10,791
Hell is waiting for you.

1279
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:15,750
Goodbye, sir.

1280
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:36,083
Hello?

1281
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:38,250
Are both of them dead?

1282
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:42,125
They died without any effort on our part.

1283
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,208
Come. I’ll take care of it.

1284
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:19,041
Thank you everyone for watching the film.

1285
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:20,333
Thanks a lot.

1286
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,583
You know him, don’t you?
He is Katthi Mahesh

1287
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:27,708
a big time reviewer.

1288
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:31,291
First time female directors cannot 
handle the genre of crime well.

1289
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:33,833
This woman did a good job of handling this genre.

1290
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:34,625
Like she’s actually watched the whole
thing right in front of her eyes.

1291
01:30:35,708 --> 01:30:38,291
Normally, the maximum number 
of stars for a review is five.

1292
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,875
Sir, why didn’t you come for the premiere?

1293
01:30:46,333 --> 01:30:47,958
I need to prepare the documents.

1294
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:49,875
Where are you?

1295
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:52,333
Guesthouse.
-Guesthouse?

1296
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:55,625
Alright, I’ll come.
