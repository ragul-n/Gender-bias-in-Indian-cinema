1
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,619
- How are you?
- Fine.

2
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,318
College is over.
And we've got our degrees.

3
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,821
- It all happened so fast.
- The way it is.

4
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,223
- When do we meet again?
- Why?

5
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,294
We're taking MBA together.
We'll get admissions easily.

6
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:15,132
Daddy isn't going to be convinced.
He says I've had enough education.

7
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,302
He wants me to get into
the family business.

8
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:22,108
Talk him into it.
It's just a matter of two years.

9
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,173
Daddy can be talked into it.
But Mummy is... impossible!

10
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,842
No knowing what she
might do to stop me.

11
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:01,108
Your son's horoscope is fine.
And the stars favor him.

12
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,474
I don't think there will be any
hurdles in your son's marriage.

13
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,153
His mother has tried out
at least a dozen girls by now.

14
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,224
So where lies the problem.

15
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:16,325
There were problems. That's why
we went through all these rituals.

16
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,223
The main problem is
this fellow himself.

17
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,363
And now you've told his mother
that unless he marries this year...

18
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,867
he will have to wait for
fifteen years!

19
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,232
Now the mother is up in arms to get
him married. And the son says.

20
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,409
He won't.

21
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,821
This is Inder. My only son.

22
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,190
- Greet them, son.
- Greetings.

23
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,382
Just back from Bangalore
after graduation. First class.

24
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,962
He wants to continue studying. But
the wife wants a bride for her son.

25
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,033
Now I don't know whom
to say yes to.

26
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,032
<i>Please consult my horoscope,
and tell me what I should do.</i>

27
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,142
Listen!

28
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,778
- Want sandwiches?
- No.

29
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,004
- Samosas?
- Not

30
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,716
- Have you eaten?
- I'm not hungry!

31
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:13,015
You mustn't keep your stomach empty
for more than two hours.

32
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,517
I'm not hungry!
I don't want to eat!

33
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,484
What's wrong with him?

34
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,221
You think hunger-striking
is going to scare anyone?

35
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,034
Even if you did scare us,
that won't make you...

36
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,459
a Vinoba Bhave or a Mahatma Gandhi.
Just go and eat.

37
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,372
<i>- I don't want to. I said so.
- What's your problem?</i>

38
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:36,366
My mother keeps nagging me.
About getting married.

39
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,237
About getting married?
But you're married! To me!

40
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,245
Stop joking, Daddy.

41
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,983
<i>I just want to know whether
you'll let me take an MBA.</i>

42
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,914
<i>No way! I failed my
tenth standard exams eleven times!</i>

43
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,816
Yet I've made enough to feed
seven generations!

44
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,124
- But ...
- No buts!

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,454
We have decided.
You're going to get married!

46
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,494
Look at this one.

47
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,061
Go on. Choose. Just choose one.

48
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,471
Surely you'll like at least one.
One of so many!

49
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,672
You're going to choose.
Right now.

50
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,968
Sure!

51
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,969
I'll let you know! Right away!

52
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,383
I like every one of them!
I'll marry every one! Let's do it!

53
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,986
How dare you insult your father!
I'lll kill you!?

54
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,418
- Go on! Kill me!
- Yes! I'll kill you!

55
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,355
Listen...

56
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,961
Listen to what?

57
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,992
The boy won't obey his parents!
No mercy for him!

58
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,530
Come over here.

59
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,498
Come on.

60
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,603
In here.
What is it?

61
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,573
Why are you arguing with him?

62
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,147
If he really wants to study,
let him.

63
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,816
Let him study?
Did you say that?

64
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,249
If he wants to study,
let him do it.

65
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,285
Go on. Tell him.

66
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,057
All right. I'll tell him that.

67
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,431
But you aren't going to change
your mind about this.

68
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,795
I won't. Tell him.

69
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,539
Did Mummy say yes?

70
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,406
<i>Dad, I can't believe our plan
succeeded so easily.</i>

71
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,311
The plan wasn't ours.
It's your plan.

72
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,146
For a change, you turned sharp.

73
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,816
In that case, from now on,
you call me Daddy.

74
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,188
What did you say?

75
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,292
You're the son!

76
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:38,521
Rascal!

77
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,403
- Are you cross with me?
- No.

78
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,177
Can ll go to the study?

79
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,605
Go on.

80
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,276
There's one thing.

81
00:06:56,617 --> 00:07:01,077
I'll think about your marriage
only if you beg me. Get it?

82
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:08,454
Then you'll get me a lovely bride!
And she'll do all the chores for you.

83
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,166
<i>As of now, I want your blessings.</i>

84
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,265
Won't you bless me?

85
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:30,617
You were worked up for nothing.

86
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,952
A bit more of the harangue,
and he would have wilted.

87
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,054
Drop the act.

88
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,585
I've taken the plot in my stride.

89
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,087
Now let's see you handle my move.

90
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,370
Missed him!

91
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:11,825
You're finished!

92
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,425
Who are you?
What do you want?

93
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:22,430
Colonel Nair!
You don't recognize me?

94
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,934
The Judge!
Mr. Hariprasad Chaturvedi. Right?

95
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:29,175
Come in!

96
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,779
Tell me, how many years
have we known each other?

97
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:34,608
Several...

98
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,110
Exactly 34 years.

99
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,382
Fantastic memory!

100
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,289
- Can ll have a glass of water?
- Sure.

101
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:47,652
But there's no one
to serve you.

102
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,587
She has gone away.

103
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,799
How many years has it been
since your wife passed away?

104
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:58,494
20 years. The anniversary
is a few days away.

105
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:03,503
You know, it was
a great shock for me.

106
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:07,311
<i>I didn't let them take her away
for the funeral.</i>

107
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,849
<i>For three days, I sat
holding her hand.</i>

108
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,653
I was expecting her to come awake
any moment.

109
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:18,085
Finally, they gave me a sedative.

110
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,692
Then they cremated her.

111
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,027
Ever since, I've been a bit
off my rocker.

112
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,590
- Who are you?

113
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,632
My son. Lallan.

114
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,004
What does he do?

115
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,333
He has just taken an admission
for an MBA course. In this city.

116
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,372
I don't want him
to go to a hostel.

117
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:41,610
<i>Then I suddenly remembered I have
a friend living in this city.</i>

118
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,279
You, Colonel Nair.
So ll came to you.

119
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:45,475
Can he live with you?

120
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:52,186
I'm not forcing myself on you.
If it's inconvenient for you...

121
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,355
Inconvenient?

122
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:59,098
<i>Chaturvedi and I were in the
same class for five years.</i>

123
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,231
We shared the same bench.
Chaturvedi's son is my son.

124
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,866
You must live here.

125
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,034
I'll send him over
with his bag and baggage tomorrow.

126
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,501
Yes! Let's go.

127
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,571
From tomorrow,
you go to college.

128
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,507
- Look who's sitting here.
- There he is.

129
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,770
Where have you been?
You've been missing all day.

130
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,914
- You didn't attend the lectures.
- You weren't in the canteen either.

131
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:33,253
Fallen in love?

132
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,681
Yes.

133
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,080
Has she said yes?

134
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,552
Not yet.

135
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,088
Meaning you've found a girl.
But she hasn't fallen for you.

136
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,728
No problem. We'll woo her.
For your sake, that is.

137
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,329
Now what's her name?

138
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,824
No idea.

139
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:50,500
Her whereabouts?

140
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,032
No idea.

141
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,635
Well, is she good to speak to?
Have you spoken to her?

142
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,639
No.

143
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:02,511
- She's for real, isn't she?
- You've seen her, haven't you?

144
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:03,783
Just a glimpse.

145
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,246
You don't know her name, her address.
How are you going to find her?

146
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,612
I'll follow my heart.

147
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,722
Poor fellow. He's on cloud nine.

148
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,826
Hey! I've become a poet!

149
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,665
Let's find her.

150
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:49,830
There's another joke.

151
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:53,198
Do you know why the ant
hid behind the tree?

152
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,899
Because it wanted to
scare the elephant.

153
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:04,148
Can we sit here?

154
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:08,318
Sit down.

155
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,857
Can we start a conversation? Please.

156
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:18,796
As if we're old friends...

157
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:21,226
Say something...

158
00:18:55,469 --> 00:19:00,930
I'm Pallavi. My friends...

159
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:04,670
Poonam and Ritu.

160
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:13,453
Those two are scoundrels.

161
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,613
And that short one.
The fatso with curly hair.

162
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,255
He's a scoundrel!

163
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,556
Don't you take his word.

164
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:40,673
Please don't misunderstand.
We were in trouble.

165
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:44,741
Now it's over, thanks to you.

166
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,310
Actually, her parents
are very strict.

167
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,147
We had been to a matinee show
without taking their permission.

168
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:52,552
Those boys in the car were sitting
in the row behind us.

169
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,925
- Then they started teasing us.
- They tried to talk to us.

170
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,733
And then they pinched us.
From behind.

171
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:04,527
We were so scared, we ran.
But they followed us.

172
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:10,138
They offered us a lift.
We refused.

173
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:12,675
Then they threatened to
force us into the car.

174
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:25,255
That's why we came in here.
Please don't mind us.

175
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,194
Not at all.

176
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,530
Thanks. We'll be leaving.

177
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,763
What if they come back?

178
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,077
The streets are unsafe for girls
nowadays. The hooligans, you know.

179
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,711
Wait here. We'll fix them.

180
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:50,209
Forget it. They won't come back.
We'll fix them if they come back.

181
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,748
- How far are you going?
- To the station.

182
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:56,181
- We'll take a train.
- We'll drop you at the station.

183
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,154
- Never mind. We'll manage.
- Why take chances?

184
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:02,920
Sit here. If they return,
we'll fix them.

185
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:05,894
<i>Good. Wait here for them,
while I drop them at the station.</i>

186
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,191
- Come on.
- Never mind. We'll manage.

187
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:09,900
- Not
- Listen!

188
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:16,505
- Now what did you say?
- What?

189
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:20,873
- You want me to fight all alone?
- I don't want to get bashed up.

190
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:24,344
<i>- We don't even know who they are.
- I know.</i>

191
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,549
She's the one.

192
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:30,713
What?!

193
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:33,221
She's...

194
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:37,956
The girl of your dreams!

195
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:39,061
Yes!

196
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,390
Is she the one?!

197
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,659
And you let her walk away!
What a hopeless Romeo!

198
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:45,666
You haven't even been introduced!

199
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:48,374
Come on! On the bike!

200
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:04,720
We thought the hoods
might be back...

201
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,691
Consider us your bodyguards?

202
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,087
We'll manage.

203
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:10,524
No. We're coming with you.

204
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:13,965
Ever since we were boys,
we've been protecting girls.

205
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,010
Over here.

206
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:35,483
Me...? The policeman is calling you.
Go over.

207
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:46,398
Where are you going?

208
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:48,895
Where is the entourage headed?

209
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:50,900
Who is she?

210
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:53,134
His sister.

211
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,302
What's your sister's name?

212
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:58,974
Madhumohini.

213
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:00,408
- And what's your name?
- Madhumohan.

214
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:01,613
Who is she?

215
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,416
His sister.

216
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,017
What's your sister's name?

217
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,780
Chandramohini.

218
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,356
- And what's your name?
- Chandramohan.

219
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:21,092
And why are you silent?
Is she your sister?

220
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:24,468
No.

221
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:27,899
<i>She's the girl I love.</i>

222
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:38,675
Is he saying the truth?

223
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:42,378
Who is he?

224
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:44,949
I don't know.

225
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,484
Do you know that one?

226
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:50,130
I don't know.

227
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:52,891
And the other one?

228
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,232
I don't know.

229
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:58,865
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

230
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,707
Yes. You're my brother.

231
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:23,996
I'll beat you so badly, you'll even
treat your wife like a sister!

232
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:34,231
There's been trouble. Some
boys were teasing your sister.

233
00:24:40,948 --> 00:24:42,848
I'll beat the daylights out of you!

234
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,120
Prithvi! What are you doing?

235
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:48,287
You have no idea what your daughter
has been up to!

236
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:51,115
- I'll ask her.
- You haven't even asked her.

237
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:52,756
- I'm asking her.
- Ask her?

238
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:54,926
With whose permission
did she go for a film?

239
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:57,254
Shut up. I'll ask!

240
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:59,397
Had it not been for me,
your daughter would've...

241
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,191
gone pillion-riding!

242
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:04,031
Quiet! Prithvi! Quiet!

243
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:07,139
<i>Vicky! What's wrong with him?
He won't even listen to me!</i>

244
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:09,238
- Don't hurt Pallavi.
- You don't know what...

245
00:25:09,476 --> 00:25:10,875
- she has been up to.
- You needn't tell her anything.

246
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:15,240
Pallavi has told us everything.
She has not done anything.

247
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:16,573
He won't listen!

248
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:18,342
Some hoods were after them.

249
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:20,953
You don't believe?

250
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:26,284
Pallavi, he wants to hear it
from you.

251
00:25:26,994 --> 00:25:28,553
Come on.

252
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:46,546
Il swear by the soul of my father
1 have done nothing wrong.

253
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,577
And I never will do anything
to make my father sad.

254
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,380
I swear. I swear.

255
00:25:55,823 --> 00:25:57,450
It's all right.

256
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:01,588
Don't cry. You believe
her now, don't you?

257
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,555
Go back to your studies.

258
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,227
Why are you standing here?
Go on... go away.

259
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:16,073
- Tell me, who were they?
- Why?

260
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:18,673
I'd like to leave
my mark on them.

261
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:20,344
Never mind.
I've beaten them up badly.

262
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:24,445
That was a policeman at work.
My account is yet to be settled.

263
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:30,319
They live in Ashok Nagar.
With some Colonel.

264
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:34,951
Listen! No broken bones.
Give them a discount.

265
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:41,563
Who is the one? Which one
is in love with my sister?

266
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:43,394
Another one.

267
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:46,597
Which one of you said he is in
love with Vikram Sinh's sister?

268
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,203
We.

269
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:49,907
Not them!

270
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:55,540
I had said that.

271
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:59,715
<i>I know it was my mistake.
For that I apologize.</i>

272
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:03,715
But if you want to create
a scene over this...

273
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:06,685
I can say it again.

274
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:19,432
My boys! Someone is
roughing up my boys!

275
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:21,933
Run! That fellow is mad!

276
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,910
Stop!

277
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:34,012
Calm down!
They have gone away!

278
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:37,147
They attacked you!

279
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:40,926
If someone was shot,
there would've been trouble.

280
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,094
So what?

281
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:47,300
I can get away with killing!
No court is going to hang me.

282
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:48,364
How come?

283
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:50,160
I'm mad!

284
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:54,035
Look, how much they beat you!

285
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:56,240
Hurry. Get some medicines.

286
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:58,468
Here's the money.
Take it.

287
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:03,172
<i>Take it, I said.
Go and see the doctor.</i>

288
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,747
Go on. All of you.

289
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,532
Why get into fights?

290
00:28:22,936 --> 00:28:25,530
All this violence.
Where is this country headed?

291
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:26,835
To the hospitals.

292
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:30,205
But it isn't our fault.
It's all because of him.

293
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:36,783
He was in love. And he told
his girl's brother about it.

294
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:40,812
What's wrong with that?
Is it a crime to be in love?

295
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:46,285
The girl's brother is an animal.
Haven't you been to the police?

296
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:49,424
How could we? That fellow
is a police Inspector.

297
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:52,629
A bastard of the first order!
The devil incarnate!

298
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:59,769
The hood who did this latest, also
turned out to be another brother.

299
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:02,038
Now what's his name? That cur!

300
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:03,501
Not Vikram Sinh?

301
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,503
The same.

302
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,438
Thank your stars you're alive.

303
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:12,183
The two have yet another brother.

304
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,978
And he's dangerous.

305
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:16,288
- He's a doctor.
- A doctor?

306
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,691
Yes. A doctor.

307
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:21,391
His name is Suraj Sinh.

308
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,758
Suraj Sinh?

309
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,697
- I've read the name somewhere.
- Not somewhere. Right here.

310
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:31,237
On the sign outside.

311
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:48,487
So how do you feel?

312
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:49,954
Burns.

313
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:53,693
That'll last for five minutes.

314
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,153
Afterwards, you're going
to be on fire!

315
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,263
I told you not to get into it.

316
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:08,336
The shot he gave us
would kill an elephant!

317
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,602
I'm burning all over!

318
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:12,374
Where did you find this one?!

319
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:15,638
Her brothers are all terrorists!
And they seem to be everywhere!

320
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:16,973
Let go of her!

321
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:17,945
What?!

322
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:20,414
Not so easily!
Not after the beating we've taken!

323
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:23,248
At least we have to square the deal
with her brothers!

324
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:26,788
You want to square the deal!
The start with the first one.

325
00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:28,584
- That one... what's his name?
- Prithvi Sinh.

326
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:31,456
Yes. The one with the moustache.
Let's start with him.

327
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:34,326
1 have an ideal

328
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:38,595
- A game! Hide and seek!
- Hide and seek?

329
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:39,868
Yes! The game about the missing man!

330
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:42,906
Missing!

331
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,002
Let's lodge a complaint.
That'll scare him.

332
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:48,442
Let's post Lallan as missing.
And we'll implicate the cop.

333
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:52,175
<i>You're lucky I'm on your side.
I just want Pallavi.</i>

334
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:55,884
We've been through all this just
because of your love-life!

335
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:58,922
Now you must have
an affair with her.

336
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,793
If she falls in love with you,
we'll have had our revenge.

337
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:05,224
Can you do it?

338
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:06,262
Sure.

339
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:10,768
They were screaming in pain!

340
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:12,733
No injections!

341
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:19,279
You did the right thing.
Gave the Romeos what they deserve.

342
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:22,581
But Prithvi...

343
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:24,981
what you did was not right.

344
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:28,317
I did whatever I had to.
I beat the daylights out of them.

345
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:31,114
And then you wanted
to hit Pallavi.

346
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:34,293
What?

347
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:36,293
Who did that?

348
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,195
You hit her?!
Hit my sister?

349
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:47,838
How could you do that?!

350
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,343
Daddy used to love her so much!

351
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,741
What was it he used to say?
"My Pallo is our princess"

352
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:03,919
Have you forgotten the word
we gave our father?

353
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:08,086
We had said we'd protect our sister.
Like soldiers.

354
00:32:08,662 --> 00:32:09,754
Have you forgotten that?

355
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:12,123
What use your tears?

356
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,163
Apologize to her.

357
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,935
All right. I'll apologize to her.

358
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:19,837
Well said!

359
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:21,505
I'll call Pallavi.

360
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,971
Pallo, come here. Hurry.

361
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,917
I have hurt you. I'm sorry.

362
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:41,020
You need not say that.

363
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:42,487
Don't say that.

364
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:45,230
Say you have forgiven me. Please.

365
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:51,431
Till you smile, there will not
be any happiness in our house.

366
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:55,003
Smile, my princess.

367
00:32:55,843 --> 00:33:01,782
For once.
You should tickle her.

368
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:07,251
Kids, you must get
your Aunt to smile.

369
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:03,838
We'll get you food everyday.

370
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:06,578
This place is deserted.

371
00:39:06,947 --> 00:39:09,439
The only ones who come
here are ghosts.

372
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,545
You'll have to take care
of ghosts yourself.

373
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:14,286
- You can do it.
- You're scaring him.

374
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:17,491
There are no ghosts.
It's superstition.

375
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,255
You'll be fine.

376
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:24,159
All right. But Daddy
is going to be worried.

377
00:39:24,398 --> 00:39:26,662
We'll handle that.

378
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,265
- Sir, have you summoned me?
- Yes.

379
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:37,166
Did you beat 3 boys in custody
on the 4th of this month?

380
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:38,736
Sir... the matter is...

381
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:40,071
No use fumbling.

382
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:43,146
Two college students and
a constable witnessed it.

383
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:45,642
The boys were teasing a girl.

384
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,750
Have you noted it in a formal
complaint? Where's the report?

385
00:39:50,124 --> 00:39:52,752
One of the boys is missing.

386
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:54,686
- Missing?!
- Yes.

387
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:58,489
This is his father.
He's a retired judge.

388
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:00,965
- And this is Colonel...
- Nair.

389
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:02,292
- Yes, Nair.

390
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:06,105
They allege that you
assaulted Lallan in custody.

391
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:08,100
And they suspect
you've hidden him away.

392
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:09,366
That's a liel

393
00:40:09,643 --> 00:40:15,673
<i>Get this clearly. I may be retired.
But I still have my contacts.</i>

394
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:18,849
If I don't find
my son soon enough...

395
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,886
I'll make sure
disciplinary action is taken.

396
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:30,092
If you don't find Lallan
in a week, you're sacked.

397
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:32,761
What are you staring at me for?

398
00:40:44,178 --> 00:40:45,407
Come here.

399
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:46,769
Excuse me.

400
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:49,282
What is it?

401
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:51,481
Where is your missing friend?

402
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:52,748
No idea.

403
00:40:52,986 --> 00:40:56,388
Don't you act smart with me.
Just tell me.

404
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,690
You don't know where
your friend is?

405
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:05,758
We in the police know how to
make the likes of you talk.

406
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:08,230
I can make you talk.

407
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:12,500
Want me to do that to you?

408
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,271
Maybe you don't?

409
00:41:14,908 --> 00:41:16,933
Then just tell me.

410
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:20,106
Try. You'll get to know.

411
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,076
- What did you say?
- Enough is enough!

412
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:26,880
Someone is dead!
Don't make a joke out of it!

413
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,314
Who is dead?

414
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:34,420
Not dead. It was murder!

415
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:35,956
- Murder?
- Yes!

416
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:41,094
You were brutal. You hit him
on the head. Again and again.

417
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:45,772
Poor fellow.
He died of a hemorrhage.

418
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,598
What are you saying?!

419
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:51,173
And after that, you dumped his body
in your jeep, and you took him away.

420
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:54,142
We'll drag you to the Supreme Court.

421
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:58,215
And if need be, we'll present
his remains as evidence.

422
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:05,482
<i>Now I know! You're cunning!</i>

423
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:09,760
You've got it all worked out,
haven't you?

424
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,122
Coming down to plainspeak...

425
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,331
Can't we have a cease-fire?

426
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:18,929
Possible.

427
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:24,502
- I'm willing if you're ready.
- Great! Now we're friends!

428
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:26,403
Someday, we must go
for a hunt together.

429
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,648
Hunting is fun, you know.

430
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:35,021
But first, we have
to discover Lallan.

431
00:42:35,522 --> 00:42:36,990
That's the problem, you know.

432
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,290
We're off for the hunt
the very next day.

433
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:42,756
Don't worry about Lallan.
He's fine.

434
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,055
<i>That I knew.</i>

435
00:42:45,366 --> 00:42:46,629
But where is he?

436
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:49,893
Some place where
he won't be found.

437
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:54,101
We're friends now, aren't we?
You'll tell me, won't you?

438
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:56,833
I wouldn't tell your father.
Neither you.

439
00:43:04,285 --> 00:43:06,845
Suraj! I'm in deep trouble!

440
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:09,317
- 1 might lose my job!?
- Why, what's up?

441
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,854
One of those boys is missing.

442
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,527
His father is accusing me of murder.
He says I've dumped the corpse.

443
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:18,298
Inder is behind all this.
I know that.

444
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,260
He's getting even with me.

445
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,328
He has the fellow hidden away.

446
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,171
In which case you should accost him.

447
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:28,205
1 tried to reason with him.
1 threatened him. But he won't wilt?!

448
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:30,442
Said he wouldn't even
tell my father!

449
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:34,712
What did you say?!
Did he insult our father?

450
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:37,540
You heard him say it!
And you didn't do anything!

451
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:40,911
You should've killed him!
The devil!

452
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:42,053
Shut up!

453
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:43,983
He's going to aggravate
the situation!

454
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:46,623
Don't you worry.
I'll do what needs to be done.

455
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,359
My job is at stake!

456
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:49,527
Let it bel

457
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:52,696
How dare he insult our father!

458
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,162
I'll make sure he's crippled!

459
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:55,459
Please! Try to reason with him!

460
00:43:55,703 --> 00:44:00,368
No, Vicky. The matter is already
out of hand. He might lose his job.

461
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:02,699
Please leave us alone.

462
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:04,340
Go inside.

463
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:12,782
Prithvi is about to lose his job.
Why make a cripple out of Inder?

464
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,181
Just kill him.

465
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,289
So that's your tension?

466
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:26,064
Not tense.

467
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:31,371
<i>But when I think of I, I feel
it was all because of us.</i>

468
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:32,467
How come?

469
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:37,104
We approached them.
We had asked them to speak to us.

470
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:39,846
So what?
We just talked to them.

471
00:44:40,114 --> 00:44:42,606
How could he say something
like that? In love with you!

472
00:44:43,017 --> 00:44:47,215
<i>That's what I don't understand.
Why did he say such a thing?</i>

473
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:49,821
Madness. What else?

474
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:51,383
By the way, what's his name?

475
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:54,854
Indrajeet Bansal.
The pet name is Inder.

476
00:44:57,498 --> 00:44:59,023
Look! He's coming.

477
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:07,036
- Let's get away!
- No. I'll wait.

478
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:08,308
I'm leaving!

479
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:20,185
I don't want to annoy you.
I don't want to hurt you.

480
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:23,252
I want apologize.
It was my mistake.

481
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:25,588
No use being shy about this.

482
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:30,057
We've met, maybe seen each other,
two or three times.

483
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:32,124
And that's about as much
as you know me.

484
00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:37,903
But I don't know why I feel as if
I've known you for years.

485
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:41,536
<i>But I didn't want to annoy you.</i>

486
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:47,679
She's so lovingly simple!

487
00:45:48,215 --> 00:45:50,650
So charming! So disarming!

488
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:06,997
<i>What I said is the truth.
'm sorry if I hurt you.</i>

489
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:12,334
Please! Stop!

490
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,874
Where have you hidden your friend?

491
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:20,208
Why did you do such a thing?

492
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:22,512
- What have I done?
- How do I say this?

493
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:26,386
Look, we're talking as equals.

494
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:29,890
Let me apologize to you too.

495
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:33,593
Please do not be angry.

496
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:36,554
Please ask your friend
to show up.

497
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:40,365
<i>Please! I request you!</i>

498
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:45,594
And please forget everything.

499
00:46:49,877 --> 00:46:53,973
The mistake was mine.
And my friends had to suffer.

500
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:57,782
<i>They want revenge.
How can I stop them?</i>

501
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:03,755
But now that you're asking me,
I'll try. Whatever I can.

502
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:06,655
Listen...

503
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,828
You asked me to forget
everything.

504
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:17,898
I'll do that too.
I'll forget everything.

505
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:25,942
<i>But how can I forget the face of
the girl I've given my heart to?</i>

506
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:32,713
I cannot forget you. Never.

507
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,939
Must you scare me?!

508
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:32,604
1 nearly had a heart attack!?!

509
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,807
Only joking!

510
00:48:38,852 --> 00:48:41,082
What news? Anything hot?

511
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,386
News is it's all over.

512
00:48:46,527 --> 00:48:49,462
You can come out.
The hide and seek is over.

513
00:48:49,797 --> 00:48:50,889
But why?

514
00:48:51,198 --> 00:48:53,530
Pallavi came to me.
She pleaded with me.

515
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:56,031
This fellow was supposed to
be suspended! What about it?

516
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:58,667
That isn't necessary.
Pallavi came to me.

517
00:48:58,906 --> 00:49:00,533
- What more do you want?
- I don't care.

518
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:03,242
That fellow is a devil! I'm not
coming out till he is suspended!

519
00:49:03,544 --> 00:49:05,979
Try to understand.
If he's suspended...

520
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:09,682
I'll lose Pallavi forever.
If he isn't suspended...

521
00:49:09,984 --> 00:49:12,009
Pallavi will surely be mine.
Someday.

522
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:14,446
You fell for her words!
A woman's words!

523
00:49:14,688 --> 00:49:17,555
Never trust a woman!
Women pretend! All of them do!

524
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:21,692
Had he been suspended
for even an hour...!

525
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:23,825
Do you remember how
he bashed us up?

526
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,203
You promised me you'd do anything
to help me get Pallavi. Remember?

527
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:36,005
<i>Then do what I say.</i>

528
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:38,937
And Pallavi will be mine.

529
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:44,110
- Sure?
- Absolutely!

530
00:49:44,885 --> 00:49:47,855
Inder has a point.
That's why we are here.

531
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:54,184
But if she's playing a game,
we aren't with you. Remember that.

532
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:03,499
If I'm wrong, I'll do
whatever you want me to.

533
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:05,569
Promise?

534
00:50:05,906 --> 00:50:08,034
Promise.

535
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:19,677
Kids! Look what I've got for you!

536
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:22,785
This is for you...
this is for you...

537
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:33,123
Mummy, this is for you.

538
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:34,728
For me?

539
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:37,561
And this is for you.

540
00:50:38,172 --> 00:50:39,731
- And this one?
- For my brother.

541
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:43,634
For you and Vicky.

542
00:50:43,978 --> 00:50:47,881
Very nice! What's the occasion?

543
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:51,643
The threat has blown over.

544
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:55,089
What do you mean?

545
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:59,622
<i>That boy I was accused of killing.</i>

546
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:06,331
1 played a neat game. He came walking.
And he presented himself.

547
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:08,331
He even wrote a note apologizing
for the incident.

548
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:10,761
1 had given him a good beating.

549
00:51:11,105 --> 00:51:15,440
<i>And he wrote that I didn't
even touch him! Bloody coward!</i>

550
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,439
His father was begging.
He wanted the case closed.

551
00:51:23,651 --> 00:51:27,315
Now they know what Prithvi Sinh
is made of!

552
00:51:27,755 --> 00:51:30,417
Not worth losing sleep over.
Say what Mummy?

553
00:51:31,024 --> 00:51:34,153
You're the one
who lost sleep. Not I

554
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:39,333
<i>This was minor.
I saw you carrying the presents...</i>

555
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,400
<i>and I thought you had done
something great!</i>

556
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:46,505
Yesterday, you were going around
with your tail between your legs.

557
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,006
Well, enjoy yourself.

558
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:55,040
Fine. Then give my gift back.

559
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:57,444
Give it to your wife.
It isn't my class, anyway.

560
00:51:57,818 --> 00:52:00,219
That tail was between
your legs yesterday!

561
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:26,257
<i>I want to thank you for asking
your friend to show up.</i>

562
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,260
I was looking for you.
At last I've met you.

563
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:34,363
Listen...

564
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:38,008
Pallavi, at home you might
be considered a kid.

565
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:42,211
But you aren't. And you can
take decisions for yourself.

566
00:59:43,016 --> 00:59:45,417
1 have said this once.
I love you.

567
00:59:45,986 --> 00:59:48,114
But you have never replied.

568
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:51,383
Give me an answer. You must.

569
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:56,185
- 1 don't know these things...
- If you like me, say yes.

570
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,225
If you don't like me,
just say it.

571
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:04,098
I don't know all these...

572
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,202
Does that mean you love me?

573
01:00:06,573 --> 01:00:08,439
<i>No...1</i>

574
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:14,911
In that case, I'll take it
that you don't love me.

575
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:16,916
But why?

576
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:18,816
So you love me! Right?

577
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,080
<i>When did I say that?</i>

578
01:00:21,555 --> 01:00:23,580
Okay, so you don't love me.

579
01:00:24,558 --> 01:00:25,787
I'm leaving.

580
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:28,825
Give me an answer.

581
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,895
<i>Can I tell you tomorrow?</i>

582
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:36,398
All right.

583
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:44,911
Listen!

584
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:46,474
Don't lie to me tomorrow!

585
01:00:46,914 --> 01:00:49,576
I know you mean yes.
I'll wait for you.

586
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:10,766
Now who has made
my princess so sad?

587
01:01:14,608 --> 01:01:19,603
Everyone says you've been looking
off-color the last three days.

588
01:01:19,914 --> 01:01:20,574
What's the matter? Tell me.

589
01:01:20,814 --> 01:01:21,940
It's nothing.

590
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:27,282
If any of us has done anything...

591
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:29,151
No.

592
01:01:29,456 --> 01:01:31,083
But why are you so glum?

593
01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:33,621
I'm fine.

594
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:37,563
You are the light of this house.

595
01:01:37,931 --> 01:01:43,597
If you stay glum, you'll
make everyone sad.

596
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:46,666
No one has said anything to me.
It's true.

597
01:01:47,408 --> 01:01:50,742
She says it's nothing.
Now don't bother her.

598
01:01:50,978 --> 01:01:52,503
Get up Go away. Let her study.

599
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:54,941
All we want is for her to be happy.

600
01:01:55,316 --> 01:01:57,944
Well all right. Now go on.

601
01:01:58,285 --> 01:02:00,754
Come on.

602
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:15,460
Are you cross because
I took away Mummy's gift?

603
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:18,237
<i>But I returned it to her.
The same evening.</i>

604
01:02:18,505 --> 01:02:20,599
- It isn't that.
- Not that, right?

605
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,466
- No.
- Then it's all right.

606
01:02:57,811 --> 01:02:59,108
<i>No. I won't do this.</i>

607
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:04,577
<i>I won't make anyone unhappy. Never.</i>

608
01:03:08,189 --> 01:03:11,022
<i>Didn't I tell you not to trust
that girl?!</i>

609
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:15,261
You're satisfied now, aren't you?
She's a fraud!

610
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:17,059
Had that brother of
hers been suspended..

611
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:20,392
We would've something to feel nice
about. We let him off the hook.

612
01:03:20,601 --> 01:03:22,831
And now the girl has vanished.
Much ado about nothing.

613
01:03:23,037 --> 01:03:27,031
Why nothing? We took a beating,
didn't we?

614
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:30,267
My Pallavi!

615
01:03:30,778 --> 01:03:33,804
Forget it. Spilt milk.

616
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:38,209
And you forget her. No dearth
of girls. Find another one.

617
01:03:40,187 --> 01:03:43,487
She's mine. I love her.
And she loves me.

618
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:45,254
She has cheated you!

619
01:03:47,461 --> 01:03:49,520
What are you staring at me for?
You think you're going to scare me?

620
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,128
Take it from me.
She'll never to be yours.

621
01:03:58,405 --> 01:04:01,102
Now where is he off to?

622
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:07,273
"It's been so long.
Don't make me wait any longer."

623
01:04:07,915 --> 01:04:10,077
"Please give me an answer.
Yes or no."

624
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:15,617
"If you can't speak it, write to me.
From your heart."

625
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:21,077
You will never do anything wrong.
I know it.

626
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:24,053
<i>And I know you won't tell me a lie.</i>

627
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,988
<i>But I have to ask you.</i>

628
01:05:27,661 --> 01:05:29,493
Did you call him here?

629
01:05:30,297 --> 01:05:31,230
Vicky...

630
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:33,130
Did you call him here?

631
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:36,066
No... but...

632
01:05:36,337 --> 01:05:39,363
That will be enough.
I understand.

633
01:05:40,073 --> 01:05:41,268
<i>I understand everything.</i>

634
01:06:14,908 --> 01:06:17,707
Don't you touch him!

635
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:19,908
Leave me!

636
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:23,011
Let go!

637
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:28,820
Don't hit him!

638
01:06:41,602 --> 01:06:44,731
<i>Leave him, I say!</i>

639
01:07:55,509 --> 01:07:56,499
Cur!

640
01:07:58,145 --> 01:08:01,308
He walked into my house and
he gave my sister a dirty note!

641
01:08:02,182 --> 01:08:07,245
My sister cried when she told me
that he's making her life miserable!

642
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:08,779
<i>What am I supposed to do?!</i>

643
01:08:09,156 --> 01:08:13,559
<i>What would you do if I messed around
with your sisters?</i>

644
01:08:13,994 --> 01:08:15,393
Will you sit and watch the fun?

645
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:20,256
This matter doesn't end here.

646
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:23,564
Come on.

647
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:31,469
- Take him to a doctor!
- No one touches him!

648
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:33,469
We'll take care of him.
Go away.

649
01:08:38,419 --> 01:08:41,184
Whatever Vicky said was a lie!

650
01:08:43,424 --> 01:08:45,051
Then why didn't
she give you a reply?

651
01:08:45,692 --> 01:08:46,955
Why didn't she come to see you?

652
01:08:47,428 --> 01:08:49,089
How did the letter
reach her brother?

653
01:08:49,763 --> 01:08:51,162
She's deceiving you!

654
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:56,764
Maybe you're right.

655
01:08:58,272 --> 01:09:03,904
Promise me you won't see her any
more. Don't even think about her.

656
01:09:05,746 --> 01:09:06,941
Promise me.

657
01:09:11,785 --> 01:09:12,911
I promise.

658
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:24,261
Who are you?

659
01:09:27,901 --> 01:09:29,096
Where do you think
you're going?

660
01:09:32,139 --> 01:09:33,129
Stop!

661
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:35,470
Hands up!

662
01:09:36,644 --> 01:09:38,134
You must be Colonel Nair!

663
01:09:38,412 --> 01:09:40,506
I've read about you.
Nice to see you!

664
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:44,284
- Hands up!
- But please don't shoot!

665
01:09:44,552 --> 01:09:45,883
What's your name?

666
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:48,621
My name?
Yes, Satish Kumar Bansal.

667
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:51,052
- That's too long. Make it short.
- What?

668
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:54,317
- Satish Kumar
- Shorter!

669
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:56,326
- Satish?
- Shorter!

670
01:09:58,899 --> 01:10:03,530
- Stop!
- Uncle Nair! That'd be a mistake!

671
01:10:03,738 --> 01:10:04,796
He's Inder's father.

672
01:10:05,139 --> 01:10:06,903
I seel

673
01:10:08,242 --> 01:10:11,678
I heard about you!
At last, we meet!

674
01:10:11,912 --> 01:10:13,141
No hair on your head?

675
01:10:13,514 --> 01:10:16,415
Please put that down.
Else I'll lose the few I have!

676
01:10:16,917 --> 01:10:17,577
How are you?

677
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:20,011
- Alive. How are you?
- The same.

678
01:10:20,254 --> 01:10:23,884
- Put that in your pocket!
- Don't worry! It isn't loaded!

679
01:10:24,325 --> 01:10:26,657
No bullets! Go on!

680
01:10:28,996 --> 01:10:29,792
Come, Uncle.

681
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:33,031
It was loaded!

682
01:10:34,702 --> 01:10:36,761
Just one bullet.

683
01:10:39,607 --> 01:10:41,097
One of these days, someone
is going to die!

684
01:10:57,624 --> 01:11:00,650
What happened?

685
01:11:01,962 --> 01:11:03,088
How did this happen?

686
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:06,690
Some people bashed me up.

687
01:11:07,368 --> 01:11:08,893
Bashed you?

688
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:14,636
Who did that? Who has dared
to touch you? Tell me.

689
01:11:14,842 --> 01:11:19,279
No. The mistake was mine.
I deserved it.

690
01:11:21,115 --> 01:11:24,551
Just don't ask me
anything about it.

691
01:11:26,653 --> 01:11:34,060
I just want to forget
everything about it.

692
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:39,596
Does it hurt?

693
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:42,230
I'll be all right.

694
01:11:44,171 --> 01:11:47,732
Come with me.
Let's go home right away.

695
01:11:48,008 --> 01:11:52,912
No! I don't want Mummy
to see me in this condition.

696
01:11:54,415 --> 01:11:56,440
And you mustn't tell her anything.

697
01:11:58,085 --> 01:11:59,348
You won't, will you?

698
01:12:00,154 --> 01:12:03,283
I won't.

699
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:11,692
Once I'm all right, I'll come home.
This is the end of my education.

700
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:18,298
I'll do whatever she wants.
Tell her that.

701
01:12:21,208 --> 01:12:22,642
But why?

702
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:26,272
Don't you know your mother?

703
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:32,551
She wants for you what
you want for yourself.

704
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:36,483
It's the same with me.

705
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:40,419
You want to study, don't you?

706
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:45,962
Go on. Please do.

707
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:50,804
You're going to be fine.

708
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:56,303
<i>But I won't leave that scoundrels!</i>

709
01:12:56,744 --> 01:13:01,580
<i>No! Let's not think about it
anymore! It's over!</i>

710
01:13:06,587 --> 01:13:11,388
<i>Can I stay with you
for a few days?</i>

711
01:13:14,294 --> 01:13:16,194
You can't do that!

712
01:13:17,031 --> 01:13:19,193
Mummy will be worried.

713
01:13:24,171 --> 01:13:25,195
Very well.

714
01:13:27,641 --> 01:13:29,200
We'll take care of ourselves.

715
01:13:30,644 --> 01:13:32,772
And you take care of yourself.

716
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:34,972
Sure.

717
01:13:40,955 --> 01:13:42,081
Stop.

718
01:13:49,964 --> 01:13:52,092
So what do you think of yourself?

719
01:13:52,733 --> 01:13:54,861
You had him beaten up so badly.

720
01:13:55,202 --> 01:13:56,363
And now you're off to college,
are you?

721
01:13:58,072 --> 01:14:01,770
All Inder wanted to know was whether
you love him. Was that so wrong?

722
01:14:02,176 --> 01:14:04,338
If you didn't want
to write to him...

723
01:14:04,578 --> 01:14:07,309
you could've thrown
the letter in his face!

724
01:14:08,049 --> 01:14:10,347
The least you could do was to
tell him you don't like him!

725
01:14:10,584 --> 01:14:17,490
You think you can do anything just
because your brothers are goons?

726
01:14:21,595 --> 01:14:23,063
Look... Inder's father.

727
01:14:26,967 --> 01:14:29,026
Who were the ones
who beat my son?

728
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,301
- We don't know.
- You know!

729
01:14:31,572 --> 01:14:33,404
You don't want to tell me?

730
01:14:34,408 --> 01:14:36,604
We don't know.
That's the truth.

731
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:39,169
Lies! You're lying!

732
01:14:40,714 --> 01:14:41,840
Tell met

733
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:45,608
Who's the one who hurt
my son?! Tell me!

734
01:14:46,187 --> 01:14:48,349
We don't know.

735
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:50,420
Don't be sorry!
Tell met

736
01:14:50,925 --> 01:14:52,689
It's true. We don't know.

737
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,255
Who were they?!
Tell met

738
01:14:54,762 --> 01:14:55,752
Tell met

739
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:59,493
- It's the truth! We don't know.
- I know. You know who hit my son!

740
01:15:00,067 --> 01:15:01,432
I know!

741
01:15:04,738 --> 01:15:07,400
You call yourselves friends!
Shame on you!

742
01:15:08,108 --> 01:15:11,373
You watched on while
he took the beating!

743
01:15:11,745 --> 01:15:12,712
Shame on you!

744
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:23,652
Heard that?!

745
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:25,622
Inder is his only son!

746
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:30,122
If we told him, he would've
hacked your brothers to pieces!

747
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,865
Go away.

748
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:36,503
No one is going to harass
you ever again.

749
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:39,702
Inder will never see you again.
Go away.

750
01:15:40,207 --> 01:15:42,005
Inder still lives in hope.

751
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:44,640
That's why he asked us
not to tell his father.

752
01:15:44,812 --> 01:15:47,474
Forget it. She's stone-hearted.
No use talking to her.

753
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:48,409
Go away.

754
01:15:49,116 --> 01:15:50,743
- Forget her.
- Get lost!

755
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,954
I want to...

756
01:17:02,156 --> 01:17:03,453
No! Don't say anything.

757
01:17:03,757 --> 01:17:05,851
<i>I don't want to listen to you.</i>

758
01:17:06,761 --> 01:17:08,092
Hear me out! Please!

759
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:09,920
I said I don't want to.

760
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:13,991
I have gotten over it.
I don't want to remember anything.

761
01:17:14,568 --> 01:17:15,592
I want to say...

762
01:17:16,036 --> 01:17:18,004
<i>I know what you want to say!</i>

763
01:17:18,372 --> 01:17:20,363
That you never gave that letter
to your brother!

764
01:17:20,741 --> 01:17:21,799
He just chanced upon it.

765
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:24,170
That you never even imagined
this would happen.

766
01:17:24,378 --> 01:17:26,244
And now you want to apologize.
Right?

767
01:17:26,447 --> 01:17:27,846
- No.
- What else?

768
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:30,918
<i>I wanted to tell you...</i>

769
01:17:32,086 --> 01:17:34,555
I like you.

770
01:17:41,262 --> 01:17:43,856
<i>No! I don't believe you.</i>

771
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:48,459
<i>You must. Believe me.
1 am telling the truth.</i>

772
01:17:54,575 --> 01:17:55,406
Really?

773
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,871
So when are you taking me home
for introductions?

774
01:18:00,281 --> 01:18:02,409
Will you be able to say it
with the same conviction...

775
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:05,277
that you love me...
you want me for yourself?

776
01:18:06,787 --> 01:18:08,448
I might not...

777
01:18:09,757 --> 01:18:11,657
I might not be able
to say it in words.

778
01:18:12,493 --> 01:18:14,325
Then stop this farce and go away.

779
01:18:19,266 --> 01:18:21,826
<i>I haven't forgotten this address.</i>

780
01:18:24,838 --> 01:18:30,504
1 thought all I had to do
was to say yes or no.

781
01:18:32,246 --> 01:18:35,910
<i>But I never imagined these
circumstance would arise.</i>

782
01:18:37,318 --> 01:18:41,221
Our lives are so different.
I know that.

783
01:18:41,622 --> 01:18:44,648
And I know it's difficult
for us to come together.

784
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:53,089
But now I'm ready
to face any situation.

785
01:18:54,602 --> 01:19:00,939
Once my brothers have calmed down,
I'll tell them everything.

786
01:19:02,109 --> 01:19:10,109
They might not concede.
But for my sake, they will.

787
01:19:11,252 --> 01:19:13,118
I know that.

788
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:21,827
<i>But as of now, I cannot tell them
what you want me to.</i>

789
01:19:22,129 --> 01:19:28,000
If after all this, I still have
no place in your heart...

790
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:32,772
I'll leave.

791
01:19:34,408 --> 01:19:35,500
Shall I leave?

792
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:43,709
I'm leaving.

793
01:19:58,732 --> 01:20:02,794
Why was she here?
What new game is she up to?

794
01:20:03,404 --> 01:20:05,099
What's her new plan?

795
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:08,471
She came here to say
she's in love with me.

796
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:11,544
She said that?

797
01:20:12,413 --> 01:20:14,939
Not once. She said it over
and over again. And she cried.

798
01:20:15,883 --> 01:20:16,907
And what did you tell her?

799
01:20:17,918 --> 01:20:20,216
<i>What could I have said?</i>

800
01:20:21,122 --> 01:20:28,722
You've forbidden me. I'm not even
supposed to think about her.

801
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:32,530
<i>I kept my promise to you, friends.</i>

802
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:36,665
And she walked away?

803
01:20:51,318 --> 01:20:52,513
Did you mean what you said?

804
01:20:53,387 --> 01:20:55,355
What?

805
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:58,185
That you love Inder?

806
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:00,285
Yes.

807
01:21:01,062 --> 01:21:02,029
Sit on the bike.

808
01:21:12,173 --> 01:21:14,403
Here. Here she is. For you.

809
01:21:15,175 --> 01:21:17,940
<i>Now I know that
she's saying the truth.</i>

810
01:21:18,612 --> 01:21:21,741
I wouldn't let a friend be
weighed down under a promise.

811
01:21:22,082 --> 01:21:23,481
You're free now.

812
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:31,616
True love is something
that comes from the heart.

813
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:35,391
Don't say this just
to make me happy.-

814
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:39,593
Inder, you know me.

815
01:21:40,968 --> 01:21:44,768
<i>Tell me, can I ever cheat you?</i>

816
01:21:51,345 --> 01:21:52,506
Do we exit now?

817
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,445
If you want us to.

818
01:21:54,682 --> 01:21:57,242
If you say so,
we can stay back.

819
01:21:57,551 --> 01:21:59,986
- No. Let's exit.
- No. We stay.

820
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:02,816
<i>- So we stay.
- No. I said we go.</i>

821
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:05,115
Inder, why don't
you say something?

822
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,057
Let Pallavi have her say.

823
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:14,891
You call this romance?

824
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:18,638
Romance we will.

825
01:22:19,073 --> 01:22:20,837
But after you've got lost!

826
01:22:37,424 --> 01:22:39,119
The mad fellow!
He's after the dog again!

827
01:22:43,397 --> 01:22:44,523
What happened?

828
01:22:50,671 --> 01:22:52,605
Either the Colonel
has gone mad again.

829
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,499
Or it's confetti
from the heavens!

830
01:23:01,082 --> 01:23:04,416
It's late. Can I leave now?

831
01:23:05,619 --> 01:23:08,247
Sure. So when do we meet again.

832
01:23:09,657 --> 01:23:10,783
Whenever you want.

833
01:23:14,662 --> 01:23:19,190
The fort on top of the hill?
Do you know the place?

834
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:21,662
We can meet there.

835
01:23:22,269 --> 01:23:23,998
The place with a lot of
wild grass?

836
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:26,838
Yes. That's the place.

837
01:23:27,274 --> 01:23:28,139
Come in.

838
01:23:29,677 --> 01:23:33,739
Lovely place. Very romantic.
We should all meet there.

839
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:36,115
Not all of us.
Just the two of us.

840
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:39,642
Where does that leave
the two of us?

841
01:23:39,854 --> 01:23:40,844
Pallavi is getting late.

842
01:23:41,222 --> 01:23:42,621
Who's going to drop her
at the station?

843
01:23:42,923 --> 01:23:45,255
- May I...

844
01:23:45,459 --> 01:23:47,757
I'm the one who brought her here.
I get to drop her.

845
01:23:48,128 --> 01:23:50,096
You brought her here.
I drop her. Come on, Pallavi.

846
01:23:50,197 --> 01:23:54,065
What right have you?
Who's she to you?

847
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:55,267
My sister.

848
01:23:58,806 --> 01:24:01,036
What's your sister's name?

849
01:24:01,442 --> 01:24:02,568
Chandramohini.

850
01:24:03,844 --> 01:24:05,312
- And you?
- Chandramohan.

851
01:24:08,115 --> 01:24:11,983
And who is she to you?

852
01:24:12,419 --> 01:24:15,514
<i>She's the girl I love.</i>

853
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:19,417
Is that true?

854
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:30,602
I'll drop her. No one else.

855
01:24:30,738 --> 01:24:31,569
But...

856
01:24:31,806 --> 01:24:32,671
It's late.

857
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:41,905
Let me drop you home.

858
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:47,314
I know you're very brave.
You needn't prove it.

859
01:24:48,756 --> 01:24:50,554
Go on. I'll manage.

860
01:25:15,683 --> 01:25:16,241
Listen...

861
01:25:18,752 --> 01:25:19,913
I'll take it the next time.

862
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:57,589
Will she make it?

863
01:25:57,892 --> 01:26:00,054
I think she said it
in a state of shock.

864
01:26:00,728 --> 01:26:01,752
<i>I don't think she's coming.</i>

865
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:05,890
He's such a misfit anyway.

866
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:13,568
Had you just kissed her once,
she would've come running to you.

867
01:26:14,308 --> 01:26:16,106
I told you she isn't coming.

868
01:26:16,977 --> 01:26:18,103
She will come.

869
01:26:18,312 --> 01:26:19,871
Hear that?

870
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,148
Inder says, so she will!

871
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:24,714
Inder is omniscient!
He can read her mind!

872
01:26:24,985 --> 01:26:28,615
For the last time,
she isn't coming!

873
01:26:28,823 --> 01:26:29,654
She's here!

874
01:26:40,267 --> 01:26:42,429
It's her first date with you.

875
01:26:42,803 --> 01:26:44,862
She must remember
this day all her life.

876
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:46,536
Make sure you do
something appropriate.

877
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:48,406
Appropriate? What?

878
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:52,843
The exam is about to begin!
And you're still asking questions!

879
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,874
A kiss! A long and lovely kiss.

880
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:58,016
Hold her and smooch!

881
01:26:58,919 --> 01:27:02,981
You insist on taking care of it to
the last kiss. Maybe I should leave?

882
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:05,659
- What's going on?
- Let's go for a holiday. Far away.

883
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:17,871
They just walked past me.

884
01:27:18,406 --> 01:27:20,101
And they didn't even notice me!

885
01:27:21,342 --> 01:27:23,140
As if they don't even know us.

886
01:27:25,746 --> 01:27:28,215
Maybe they don't want
to disturb us.

887
01:27:31,685 --> 01:27:33,084
In there.

888
01:27:33,287 --> 01:27:34,277
In the shade!

889
01:27:43,464 --> 01:27:45,660
Don't just chatter!
Make our day!

890
01:27:58,946 --> 01:27:59,742
What's happening?

891
01:28:00,347 --> 01:28:01,678
Stones.

892
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:02,474
What?

893
01:28:02,683 --> 01:28:04,913
He's playing with stones!

894
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:07,318
It's going to rain today.

895
01:28:09,757 --> 01:28:11,225
But there are no clouds.

896
01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:17,530
There was a forecast.
It's going to rain.

897
01:28:21,602 --> 01:28:23,934
Do you listen to the
weather forecast?

898
01:28:24,338 --> 01:28:25,305
No.

899
01:28:25,773 --> 01:28:27,639
I don't either.

900
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:32,041
Just saw it on TV yesterday.

901
01:28:35,282 --> 01:28:37,717
Do you have a TV at home?

902
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,455
A color TV?
Or a black and white?

903
01:28:42,723 --> 01:28:45,556
Both. Earlier we had
a black and white set.

904
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,795
But my brothers have given us
a color TV.

905
01:28:51,499 --> 01:28:53,490
You're scared of your brothers,
aren't you?

906
01:28:54,802 --> 01:29:02,802
<i>Not scared. But whenever I think
about them, I get nervous.</i>

907
01:29:06,146 --> 01:29:11,710
I know they will concede.
Everything will be all right.

908
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:18,488
I have faith in them.
They love me very much.

909
01:29:19,093 --> 01:29:19,958
Me too.

910
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:29,597
I want to tell you something too.
But I don't know...

911
01:29:31,338 --> 01:29:34,467
<i>I know what you want to tell me.</i>

912
01:29:37,211 --> 01:29:39,737
Say "Me too".

913
01:29:44,718 --> 01:29:47,016
Me too.

914
01:30:06,674 --> 01:30:07,266
What are they doing?

915
01:30:07,508 --> 01:30:08,737
- They are laughing.
- What?

916
01:30:09,043 --> 01:30:10,738
He must have told her
that silly old joke.

917
01:30:11,112 --> 01:30:13,604
I have a feeling this girl
is going to dump him after all.

918
01:30:14,115 --> 01:30:16,209
<i>What was I saying?</i>

919
01:30:16,817 --> 01:30:19,514
- The rains?
- Yes. The rains.

920
01:30:20,121 --> 01:30:24,456
Even the grass flowers during
the rains. Did you know that?

921
01:30:24,758 --> 01:30:26,192
- The grass?
- Yes.

922
01:30:26,527 --> 01:30:29,189
- Have you seen grass seeds?
- No.

923
01:30:29,563 --> 01:30:31,190
- I'll show you.
- Never mind.

924
01:30:32,366 --> 01:30:33,390
It's worth seeing.

925
01:30:34,535 --> 01:30:36,469
- They are as pretty as flowers.
- Really?

926
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:40,231
Don't do it.
There might be thorns!

927
01:30:41,308 --> 01:30:42,173
Are they doing anything?

928
01:30:42,476 --> 01:30:44,604
Yes. They're catching butterflies.

929
01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:46,470
- Butterflies
- Oh yes!

930
01:30:49,316 --> 01:30:50,613
Trying out romance!

931
01:30:51,018 --> 01:30:51,883
Come on.

932
01:30:53,787 --> 01:30:54,515
Stop!

933
01:30:54,922 --> 01:30:56,219
Stop! Please!

934
01:30:59,326 --> 01:31:00,225
Enough!

935
01:31:00,794 --> 01:31:03,195
In this age of rock,
you're stone-aged!

936
01:31:03,597 --> 01:31:05,156
We were talking about
so many things!

937
01:31:05,533 --> 01:31:08,867
This is romance.
Not entertainment for the audience!

938
01:31:09,403 --> 01:31:13,636
- Now aren't we friends?
- Yes.

939
01:31:14,074 --> 01:31:16,668
- We wish you well, don't you?
- Yes.

940
01:31:17,011 --> 01:31:19,002
And the two of you have so many
things to tell each other?

941
01:31:19,313 --> 01:31:22,214
- Yes.
- But you cannot express it.

942
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:23,448
Here.

943
01:31:25,653 --> 01:31:28,918
- Here you are.
- What is this?

944
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:31,884
<i>- Blank paper.
- What do I do with this?</i>

945
01:31:32,326 --> 01:31:35,261
- The day today. Monday?
- Yes.

946
01:31:35,596 --> 01:31:37,064
- So tomorrow is Tuesday?
- Yes.

947
01:31:37,364 --> 01:31:42,427
Go on. Put the words on paper.

948
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:47,733
See you tomorrow.
Come on, boys.

949
01:36:21,515 --> 01:36:23,108
- What have you written?
- Lots and lots.

950
01:36:23,684 --> 01:36:27,279
Only you can understand it.
What have you written?

951
01:36:27,755 --> 01:36:29,621
About as much as you'll
be able to understand.

952
01:36:30,057 --> 01:36:31,456
Show me.

953
01:36:33,327 --> 01:36:35,853
One minute!
Wait!

954
01:36:36,197 --> 01:36:38,564
Give that to me.
Now it can't get lost.

955
01:36:38,832 --> 01:36:40,800
What are you doing?!
Listen!

956
01:36:41,102 --> 01:36:44,936
We've been serving sentry duty
for long enough.

957
01:36:45,205 --> 01:36:47,071
You're going to hide
nothing from us.

958
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:49,706
Ms Pallavi.
Your letter please.

959
01:36:50,311 --> 01:36:53,212
Now we face off and
read it out aloud.

960
01:36:54,381 --> 01:36:55,780
Don't read it like news.

961
01:36:56,016 --> 01:36:58,144
Use a bit of romance.
To that effect.

962
01:37:04,592 --> 01:37:06,424
What's in yours?

963
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,922
Nothing. Blanked out.

964
01:37:10,264 --> 01:37:13,290
Mine too. White, as if
it's just been dry cleaned.

965
01:37:13,567 --> 01:37:16,036
How come mine is whiter
than yours?

966
01:37:16,303 --> 01:37:17,464
Let's ask them.

967
01:37:21,442 --> 01:37:23,410
Aren't you ashamed?

968
01:37:23,811 --> 01:37:26,371
We got bashed,
landed in trouble...

969
01:37:26,714 --> 01:37:28,580
just so that the two of you
get together.

970
01:37:28,816 --> 01:37:31,217
And the two of you
can't even romanticize!

971
01:37:31,385 --> 01:37:33,911
If this is your romance,
you should rather sit at home.

972
01:37:34,321 --> 01:37:38,019
The two of you have made fools
out of us. The friendship is over.

973
01:37:38,325 --> 01:37:39,224
- Come on, Lallan.
- Come.

974
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:40,925
- Listen Lallan.
- We don't want to.

975
01:37:41,228 --> 01:37:42,662
Where are you going?

976
01:37:47,301 --> 01:37:49,429
They walked out on us!
Why are they cross?

977
01:37:49,637 --> 01:37:52,368
- Nice act.
- Right?

978
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,971
Now he's going to kiss her.

979
01:37:54,342 --> 01:37:55,707
<i>I think they want...</i>

980
01:37:58,846 --> 01:38:01,577
me to touch you.

981
01:38:02,283 --> 01:38:03,944
How?

982
01:38:05,919 --> 01:38:11,289
<i>Maybe I could touch your lips.</i>

983
01:38:11,926 --> 01:38:13,519
Why?

984
01:38:17,097 --> 01:38:24,333
Maybe they want me to kiss you.

985
01:38:27,608 --> 01:38:31,306
No! Don't do that.
I'm going to run away!

986
01:38:31,512 --> 01:38:32,707
I'm going to kiss you!

987
01:38:33,881 --> 01:38:37,374
Pallavi! Stop!

988
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,687
The chance of the day!

989
01:38:41,088 --> 01:38:43,420
Don't let her slip!?

990
01:38:44,558 --> 01:38:45,389
Get her?

991
01:38:49,463 --> 01:38:53,127
Get her! Hold her tight!

992
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,507
Lallan! Stop him!

993
01:39:43,817 --> 01:39:45,444
Stop!

994
01:39:50,224 --> 01:39:51,453
Not!

995
01:39:52,059 --> 01:39:53,117
Don't stop him!

996
01:39:54,061 --> 01:39:56,496
Let him! Let him beat me
as much as he wants to!

997
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:14,011
Don't hurt him!

998
01:40:15,015 --> 01:40:16,244
1 belong to him!

999
01:40:16,984 --> 01:40:17,883
He's mine!

1000
01:40:33,668 --> 01:40:34,829
Wait!

1001
01:40:35,436 --> 01:40:36,631
Please don't leave like this!

1002
01:40:37,438 --> 01:40:38,599
Listen to me!

1003
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,435
Don't hate me!

1004
01:40:42,309 --> 01:40:44,209
You can hate someone
who is alive.

1005
01:40:44,779 --> 01:40:46,679
For me you are dead!

1006
01:40:47,114 --> 01:40:48,309
I have no sister!

1007
01:40:51,986 --> 01:40:53,385
Not hate you!

1008
01:40:54,655 --> 01:40:57,625
I have nothing but hatred
for you!

1009
01:40:58,359 --> 01:40:59,849
And when my brothers
come to know of this...

1010
01:41:00,228 --> 01:41:03,095
they will hate you
even morel

1011
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:07,801
Your mother will hate you too!

1012
01:41:19,613 --> 01:41:21,707
Inder! What's going
to happen now?

1013
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,950
I didn't imagine
this would happen!

1014
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,654
<i>What am I going to do now?</i>

1015
01:41:28,455 --> 01:41:30,753
<i>How can I go back home?</i>

1016
01:41:31,792 --> 01:41:34,227
I can't face my mother!

1017
01:41:35,096 --> 01:41:36,393
I can't bear this!

1018
01:41:38,933 --> 01:41:40,162
I'm not going home!

1019
01:41:48,175 --> 01:41:49,108
What's the matter, Vicky?

1020
01:42:02,056 --> 01:42:03,546
What happened?

1021
01:42:04,725 --> 01:42:05,886
Tell met

1022
01:42:07,228 --> 01:42:08,161
What happened?

1023
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:12,927
She is gone.

1024
01:42:14,001 --> 01:42:15,435
The princess has gone away.

1025
01:42:16,237 --> 01:42:18,171
What are you saying?! How...?

1026
01:42:18,438 --> 01:42:21,601
<i>Had it been anyone else,
I wouldn't have been so unhappy.</i>

1027
01:42:22,042 --> 01:42:23,476
But this I cannot tolerate!

1028
01:42:24,078 --> 01:42:27,343
Had it not been for Prithvi,
I would have broken his bones!

1029
01:42:28,048 --> 01:42:29,675
Why did he have to stop me?

1030
01:42:30,184 --> 01:42:32,278
Stop talking in riddles.
What is it?

1031
01:42:32,586 --> 01:42:35,681
She clung to Inder!
And she said she's his!

1032
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:39,157
She loves him?
She said that to me!?

1033
01:42:39,493 --> 01:42:41,018
- Pallavi? She said that?
- Yes.

1034
01:42:41,395 --> 01:42:43,386
She will not step into this house.

1035
01:42:43,664 --> 01:42:45,496
Not without him!

1036
01:42:50,638 --> 01:42:52,902
Why are you standing like morons?

1037
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,703
If she has gone away,
let her go!

1038
01:42:55,009 --> 01:43:00,072
Let her die! She doesn't care
for you! Why are you crying?!

1039
01:43:00,414 --> 01:43:04,373
It's all the result of
pampering!

1040
01:43:04,785 --> 01:43:07,948
You pampered her!
Now see the result!

1041
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:10,783
Throw away all her belongings!

1042
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:13,025
Get rid of everything
that bears her mark!

1043
01:43:13,494 --> 01:43:16,657
I don't want her!
I don't want a daughter like that!

1044
01:43:17,298 --> 01:43:20,563
Burn everything
that reminds us of her!

1045
01:43:47,361 --> 01:43:49,159
The light has gone out
of our lives!

1046
01:43:50,297 --> 01:43:51,423
Let her go away!

1047
01:43:52,066 --> 01:43:54,535
But that scoundrel!
He took our Pallavi away from us!

1048
01:43:55,002 --> 01:43:57,596
I'll hack him to pieces!

1049
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:00,832
Any news?

1050
01:44:01,075 --> 01:44:02,474
- They've burnt everything.
- Burnt?

1051
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:05,472
- They've disowned Pallavi.
- What is going to happen now?

1052
01:44:05,746 --> 01:44:10,513
They were planning.

1053
01:44:10,818 --> 01:44:13,412
- A plane?
- No! A helicopter! Shut up!

1054
01:44:15,522 --> 01:44:19,288
- Did you understand anything?
- No.

1055
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:22,254
Neither I.

1056
01:44:22,663 --> 01:44:26,691
Then came the younger brother.

1057
01:44:27,234 --> 01:44:30,329
Everyone accepted this plan.

1058
01:44:47,889 --> 01:44:49,948
It's dangerous!

1059
01:44:50,358 --> 01:44:52,224
I'm not getting involved!

1060
01:44:52,693 --> 01:44:54,821
Do what you have to do!

1061
01:44:58,365 --> 01:44:59,799
Now have you had enough?

1062
01:45:00,268 --> 01:45:01,258
I told you...

1063
01:45:02,803 --> 01:45:04,464
Why must 1?
And why didn't you go?

1064
01:45:04,772 --> 01:45:05,898
What's up?

1065
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,436
Bad news.

1066
01:45:08,909 --> 01:45:11,105
They have disowned Pallavi.

1067
01:45:11,912 --> 01:45:13,880
They've burnt all her belongings.

1068
01:45:14,248 --> 01:45:15,272
What?!

1069
01:45:15,616 --> 01:45:17,414
And now they are up to something.

1070
01:45:17,785 --> 01:45:18,718
What?

1071
01:45:19,219 --> 01:45:20,653
That's what we can't understand.

1072
01:45:20,988 --> 01:45:23,787
- That madcap!
- That's beside the point.

1073
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:26,991
Whatever they do, it's surely
going to be something drastic.

1074
01:45:32,466 --> 01:45:35,902
It could be dangerous
for you to stay here.

1075
01:45:36,571 --> 01:45:38,539
The two of you should get away.

1076
01:46:26,454 --> 01:46:28,286
This is Indian champagne.

1077
01:46:34,862 --> 01:46:37,854
Who is it?

1078
01:46:38,132 --> 01:46:39,531
Cur! Come out!

1079
01:46:41,602 --> 01:46:42,433
And who are you?

1080
01:46:44,038 --> 01:46:45,472
Inder isn't at home.
What is the matter?

1081
01:46:45,673 --> 01:46:47,198
We have come to see those parents..

1082
01:46:47,574 --> 01:46:50,009
Who have fed their son with animal feed!

1083
01:46:50,211 --> 01:46:51,610
And have raised him like an ass!

1084
01:46:51,879 --> 01:46:53,870
To fulfill his stupid needs...

1085
01:46:54,115 --> 01:46:56,584
keep a few more asses like him!

1086
01:46:56,917 --> 01:46:58,385
So that idiot can have company!

1087
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:00,753
What nonsense is this?!

1088
01:47:01,556 --> 01:47:03,217
You haven't yet told me
what this is all about!

1089
01:47:03,891 --> 01:47:06,087
Your son has eloped
with my sister!

1090
01:47:07,261 --> 01:47:09,059
She was like a daughter to me!

1091
01:47:09,964 --> 01:47:14,162
That scoundrel! He has seduced
my sister. And now they're hiding!

1092
01:47:15,102 --> 01:47:18,800
I don't want my sister back!
For us, she's dead!

1093
01:47:19,173 --> 01:47:20,937
But get this one thing!

1094
01:47:21,308 --> 01:47:25,939
We'll hunt your son down!
And we'll kill him like a dog!

1095
01:47:26,346 --> 01:47:27,177
Remember that!

1096
01:47:29,917 --> 01:47:32,386
And we'll do it right in front
of your eyes if we have to!

1097
01:47:49,603 --> 01:47:50,695
Everybody... please be seated.

1098
01:47:52,173 --> 01:47:53,368
<i>No, I mean if there's a problem...</i>

1099
01:47:53,574 --> 01:47:54,564
No. Please be seated.

1100
01:47:54,809 --> 01:47:56,038
Excuse me...

1101
01:48:01,014 --> 01:48:04,075
What's happening?
We must look for him.

1102
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:06,582
To what end?!
Didn't you hear?!

1103
01:48:07,354 --> 01:48:09,982
He has eloped with her
He's hiding!

1104
01:48:10,424 --> 01:48:13,155
Where do I look for him?!
And why should 1?1

1105
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,489
Let him go wherever he wants!

1106
01:48:15,963 --> 01:48:19,024
He'll come here when he tires out.
Then we'll see.

1107
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:23,264
But they could hurt Inder.

1108
01:48:23,471 --> 01:48:24,199
Let them!

1109
01:48:24,505 --> 01:48:28,567
If what they say is true,
then he deserves it.

1110
01:48:34,482 --> 01:48:35,916
Now why do you have to be sad?

1111
01:48:36,416 --> 01:48:39,852
I'm the one who should be feeling
sorry. It's all my fault!

1112
01:48:40,488 --> 01:48:43,480
I treated him like an equal.
Not as a son.

1113
01:48:43,791 --> 01:48:46,158
And this is the result.

1114
01:48:47,461 --> 01:48:50,954
Did you hear how that fellow
was talking?

1115
01:48:51,432 --> 01:48:55,130
Does that not tell you where this
girl comes from? Where she belongs!

1116
01:48:56,270 --> 01:49:01,800
But my Inder would never do
such a thing! How could he?!

1117
01:49:07,448 --> 01:49:08,711
<i>Neither do . But...</i>

1118
01:49:13,354 --> 01:49:17,985
Well then, tell me what you
want me to do. I'll do it.

1119
01:49:24,398 --> 01:49:27,265
You don't stay in this city
for another minute!

1120
01:49:27,602 --> 01:49:29,696
They are in a murderous rage.
They are beating up everyone.

1121
01:49:30,571 --> 01:49:34,303
The two of you look nice together.

1122
01:49:35,876 --> 01:49:37,503
But it's so scary.

1123
01:49:38,078 --> 01:49:43,608
This could lead to a tragedy.
Either of you...

1124
01:49:46,253 --> 01:49:51,419
There's still time.
You could still change your minds.

1125
01:49:51,592 --> 01:49:52,821
No.

1126
01:49:55,363 --> 01:49:59,197
There won't be any tragedy.

1127
01:50:01,168 --> 01:50:05,002
We're going home.
To my parents.

1128
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:13,005
We are getting married.

1129
01:50:17,885 --> 01:50:19,910
Move it then, Right now.

1130
01:50:39,473 --> 01:50:41,134
In the car.

1131
01:50:44,412 --> 01:50:45,106
Come along.

1132
01:50:45,446 --> 01:50:46,311
Only you.

1133
01:50:46,547 --> 01:50:47,878
- But Pallawvi?
- 1 know.

1134
01:50:48,115 --> 01:50:51,574
And that's why I want you
to come alone.

1135
01:50:52,186 --> 01:50:53,278
But without Pallavi...?

1136
01:50:53,554 --> 01:50:54,885
What about it?

1137
01:50:55,289 --> 01:50:56,085
I'm not coming.

1138
01:50:58,092 --> 01:51:00,754
There is someone at home who
wants to find a girl for you.

1139
01:51:02,029 --> 01:51:05,795
And right now, she's praying
for your life!

1140
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:09,201
<i>Never in my life have I
hurt your mother!</i>

1141
01:51:09,537 --> 01:51:11,767
<i>And I won't have you
do this to her!</i>

1142
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,940
She's miles apart from the girl
your mother would want for you.

1143
01:51:16,444 --> 01:51:18,674
<i>Daddy! I beg of you!</i>

1144
01:51:19,814 --> 01:51:21,282
<i>I won't come without Pallavi!</i>

1145
01:51:22,683 --> 01:51:24,082
You're coming with me!

1146
01:51:24,652 --> 01:51:26,017
As far as this girl is concerned...

1147
01:51:26,253 --> 01:51:28,221
they will dump her at her house!

1148
01:51:28,456 --> 01:51:30,117
Take her away!
Don't you touch her!

1149
01:51:31,725 --> 01:51:33,693
Leave me!

1150
01:51:34,061 --> 01:51:36,359
Let go!

1151
01:51:45,406 --> 01:51:46,430
I'll kill you!

1152
01:51:48,242 --> 01:51:49,038
Kill me!

1153
01:51:49,276 --> 01:51:50,266
Go on!

1154
01:51:50,477 --> 01:51:53,208
No, Inder! You mustn't raise your
hand against your father!

1155
01:51:53,914 --> 01:51:54,813
I'll go away.

1156
01:51:57,251 --> 01:51:58,241
Hold on...

1157
01:52:00,321 --> 01:52:03,484
- Are you coming? Or aren't you?
- Not

1158
01:52:04,358 --> 01:52:07,123
<i>She's my love! And I will
take her home to my mother!</i>

1159
01:52:07,595 --> 01:52:09,154
I'm going nowhere without her!

1160
01:52:10,497 --> 01:52:12,261
You will.

1161
01:52:13,534 --> 01:52:14,865
And you will come alone.

1162
01:52:15,569 --> 01:52:18,630
If you truly love your mother...

1163
01:52:18,939 --> 01:52:22,671
if you are a true son
to your mother...

1164
01:52:23,144 --> 01:52:27,103
you will be home by tonight.
And you will leave her.

1165
01:52:28,782 --> 01:52:32,719
Otherwise, even if her brothers
end up killing you...

1166
01:52:33,321 --> 01:52:38,452
<i>I won't shed a tear.</i>

1167
01:52:40,561 --> 01:52:45,192
You will come.
Make sure you do.

1168
01:52:56,878 --> 01:52:58,312
You'll come, won't you?

1169
01:53:12,359 --> 01:53:13,292
Where do you go from here?

1170
01:53:16,230 --> 01:53:18,528
Stop staring like zombies
and come home with me.

1171
01:53:19,233 --> 01:53:21,133
I'll give you a taste of
hospitality.

1172
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:25,500
I haven't a palace.
Just a little shanty.

1173
01:53:26,607 --> 01:53:28,132
My father is a poor fisherman.

1174
01:53:28,642 --> 01:53:32,169
But at heart, he's a lion.
He'll stand by me.

1175
01:53:33,247 --> 01:53:34,305
He's big at heart.

1176
01:53:36,383 --> 01:53:38,249
I'll take you home.

1177
01:53:38,986 --> 01:53:40,385
No one can touch you there.

1178
01:59:15,889 --> 01:59:18,984
Daddy, get a hold on yourself.
You've drunk too much.

1179
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:21,258
Listen to me, will you?

1180
01:59:22,129 --> 01:59:24,359
Who are you?

1181
01:59:28,702 --> 01:59:31,763
Oh Peter! My son!

1182
01:59:33,707 --> 01:59:37,041
When did you come?
I never even noticed!

1183
01:59:37,445 --> 01:59:40,471
Drink like a fish, and you hear
nothing and you see nothing!

1184
01:59:40,815 --> 01:59:42,613
Now come on.
My friends are with me.

1185
01:59:42,984 --> 01:59:44,884
My son's friends!

1186
01:59:45,652 --> 01:59:48,178
Where are they?
I don't see them!

1187
01:59:48,489 --> 01:59:49,957
My son's friends!
Where are you?

1188
01:59:50,224 --> 01:59:51,214
Over there.

1189
01:59:51,592 --> 01:59:56,086
That friend of yours
looks like a girl.

1190
01:59:56,363 --> 01:59:58,593
Not like one.
She is a girl.

1191
01:59:58,932 --> 02:00:00,229
A girl!

1192
02:00:00,667 --> 02:00:03,159
This is Pallavi.
And this is my friend Inder.

1193
02:00:03,604 --> 02:00:05,402
They want to marry.

1194
02:00:05,706 --> 02:00:07,538
- Not married yet?
- No.

1195
02:00:08,109 --> 02:00:09,406
Look here, Uncle...

1196
02:00:09,710 --> 02:00:12,008
Looks like Peter
is in trouble.

1197
02:00:12,346 --> 02:00:13,973
I think he wants to
tell you something.

1198
02:00:17,551 --> 02:00:19,849
Inder is in love
with this girl.

1199
02:00:20,655 --> 02:00:22,089
The girl loves him too.

1200
02:00:22,623 --> 02:00:24,990
But their families
are against it.

1201
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:27,755
They are going
to come here too.

1202
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:34,561
Hey folks...

1203
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:38,734
This boy and this girl
are staying here.

1204
02:00:39,774 --> 02:00:42,641
Any problems? Any hassles.

1205
02:00:43,010 --> 02:00:44,273
- None.

1206
02:00:46,614 --> 02:00:53,577
Then rest assured. No one can
take you away from here.

1207
02:00:56,891 --> 02:01:02,796
But you have to promise me that
the two of you will stay together.

1208
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:12,399
We are poor. But we are proud.
And our pride is at stake.

1209
02:01:13,007 --> 02:01:13,803
Sure.

1210
02:01:16,677 --> 02:01:20,636
We promise we'll be together
all our lives.

1211
02:01:21,716 --> 02:01:23,707
We will never separate.

1212
02:01:26,253 --> 02:01:30,349
From this day...

1213
02:01:31,025 --> 02:01:33,892
these kids are ours!

1214
02:01:46,707 --> 02:01:51,941
Some people are coming here.
In jeeps. Driving like savages.

1215
02:01:55,482 --> 02:02:00,921
Some people are here
to take a look-see.

1216
02:02:01,555 --> 02:02:03,785
Let's give them a warm welcome.

1217
02:02:18,238 --> 02:02:19,262
Where's Peter's house?

1218
02:02:22,810 --> 02:02:24,539
Know where Peter's house is?

1219
02:02:28,716 --> 02:02:29,911
Where's Pinto's house?
Peter's father.

1220
02:02:31,252 --> 02:02:32,583
Keep working, guys!

1221
02:02:33,754 --> 02:02:37,691
Where is Pinto?
Can't hear me, can you?

1222
02:02:38,559 --> 02:02:44,123
Right here.
What do you want?

1223
02:02:44,665 --> 02:02:48,067
A boy and a girl.
Your son has brought them here.

1224
02:02:48,202 --> 02:02:49,169
Where are they?

1225
02:02:49,370 --> 02:02:51,099
We'll dump the girl.

1226
02:02:51,405 --> 02:02:53,373
But that bastard!
We're going to kill them!

1227
02:02:55,142 --> 02:02:56,576
That's my shack.

1228
02:02:57,578 --> 02:02:59,171
The kids are in there.

1229
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:01,748
Go on. Take them away.

1230
02:03:15,296 --> 02:03:17,628
You dogs! Come on!

1231
02:03:18,765 --> 02:03:20,233
Have you got it in you?!

1232
02:03:20,467 --> 02:03:23,630
Let's see who has the guts
to take our kids away!

1233
02:03:24,338 --> 02:03:26,306
Stop behaving like savages!

1234
02:03:26,573 --> 02:03:29,941
All we want is that boy and
that girl. They have eloped.

1235
02:03:30,377 --> 02:03:31,503
Is that so?

1236
02:03:32,813 --> 02:03:35,475
You aren't going to resort
to violence, are you?

1237
02:03:36,117 --> 02:03:39,644
We do what we want to!
Who are you to question us?!

1238
02:03:40,154 --> 02:03:44,591
Bastards! Hiding them, are you?
Bring them out!

1239
02:03:46,494 --> 02:03:53,525
The boy and the girl came to us
asking for help. They're nice kids.

1240
02:03:54,001 --> 02:03:57,130
How can we throw them out?

1241
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:01,632
If this is going to be
a show of strength, so be it.

1242
02:04:02,610 --> 02:04:04,442
Let's see who drags them out.

1243
02:04:04,846 --> 02:04:08,714
Bring them out!
Else you'll die a horrible death!

1244
02:04:10,852 --> 02:04:14,914
Do it, kid. Shut up and do it.

1245
02:04:32,607 --> 02:04:35,201
They have touched Jojo Uncle!
Cut their hands off!

1246
02:04:39,013 --> 02:04:39,912
Stop it!

1247
02:04:40,147 --> 02:04:41,911
<i>Stop it I say! Stop!</i>

1248
02:04:45,252 --> 02:04:46,481
Hold on, everyone!

1249
02:04:48,689 --> 02:04:54,150
No outsider has ever won
a fight on this beach.

1250
02:04:55,462 --> 02:05:00,298
We have cut off the hands that have
dared to rise against us!

1251
02:05:01,235 --> 02:05:03,033
That is history!

1252
02:05:05,473 --> 02:05:10,411
Two innocent kids.
In love.

1253
02:05:11,846 --> 02:05:14,941
They have come to us
seeking refuge.

1254
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:18,546
They can stay here
as long as they want to.

1255
02:05:19,954 --> 02:05:22,514
<i>As long as I am alive,
you cannot touch them.</i>

1256
02:05:24,725 --> 02:05:27,456
Bring the kids here.

1257
02:05:56,624 --> 02:05:59,685
Touch them if you dare!

1258
02:06:02,129 --> 02:06:04,461
Dumbstruck, are you?!

1259
02:06:05,566 --> 02:06:07,125
Bloody dogs!

1260
02:06:08,068 --> 02:06:12,801
Touch them if you dare!

1261
02:06:23,951 --> 02:06:24,918
All right.

1262
02:06:25,252 --> 02:06:27,380
We will never touch them.

1263
02:06:38,032 --> 02:06:42,094
For us, you are an untouchable!

1264
02:06:44,472 --> 02:06:49,911
You are the reason why we've had
to go through this!

1265
02:06:51,145 --> 02:06:59,145
When we saw you, we thought
you would come running to us!

1266
02:07:02,957 --> 02:07:06,257
- That's what we thought.
- Enough! No more!

1267
02:07:07,361 --> 02:07:09,329
You will cry! You will beg!

1268
02:07:09,764 --> 02:07:13,166
But our doors are closed
for you. Forever!

1269
02:07:13,767 --> 02:07:15,360
You have no place
in our lives!

1270
02:07:15,770 --> 02:07:18,262
Not at home!
Not in our hearts!

1271
02:07:20,107 --> 02:07:22,872
No use talking
to the dead!

1272
02:07:23,711 --> 02:07:25,338
Come on! Come on!

1273
02:07:33,854 --> 02:07:36,516
What are you staring at?
Get back to work.

1274
02:07:41,929 --> 02:07:45,092
Don't worry, little girl.

1275
02:07:46,033 --> 02:07:51,164
Go where you want to.
Go find a place for yourself.

1276
02:07:51,572 --> 02:07:53,370
A place where there is
peace of mind.

1277
02:08:01,315 --> 02:08:02,783
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing.

1278
02:08:03,717 --> 02:08:04,775
About your brothers?

1279
02:08:05,286 --> 02:08:12,989
My mother. My brothers. Everyone.

1280
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:24,601
Uncle Jojo abused your brothers
in front of you.

1281
02:08:27,508 --> 02:08:30,375
That was too much!

1282
02:08:34,782 --> 02:08:42,782
You thought they would
accept us in the end.

1283
02:08:44,859 --> 02:08:46,258
Do you still think so?

1284
02:08:46,727 --> 02:08:47,558
No.

1285
02:08:50,297 --> 02:08:51,822
It's all over.

1286
02:08:53,501 --> 02:08:54,525
They will accept us.

1287
02:08:54,968 --> 02:08:57,369
There's only one person
who can understand us.

1288
02:08:58,872 --> 02:08:59,896
Who?

1289
02:09:03,344 --> 02:09:04,334
Mummy

1290
02:09:06,146 --> 02:09:07,511
It was Daddy who said
all that.

1291
02:09:09,216 --> 02:09:13,016
<i>But if I beg my mother for you,
she'll relent.</i>

1292
02:09:15,189 --> 02:09:17,624
1 think I should see her.

1293
02:09:18,058 --> 02:09:19,253
- Now?
- Yes.

1294
02:09:19,627 --> 02:09:20,992
- Will you go alone?
- Yes.

1295
02:09:21,529 --> 02:09:23,258
<i>But I won't tell these people
about it.</i>

1296
02:09:23,564 --> 02:09:24,895
Else they won't let me leave.

1297
02:09:25,967 --> 02:09:27,833
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Maybe with Mummy.

1298
02:09:28,102 --> 02:09:30,196
Don't go alone, Inder.
I'm so scared.

1299
02:09:30,604 --> 02:09:31,969
It's going to be all right.

1300
02:09:33,407 --> 02:09:35,603
Don't stop me.

1301
02:09:36,244 --> 02:09:37,973
I'm going.

1302
02:09:38,946 --> 02:09:41,711
Say you'll be back!

1303
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:20,949
Have you dropped her home?

1304
02:10:23,424 --> 02:10:25,085
I want to know!

1305
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:27,493
No.

1306
02:10:29,096 --> 02:10:30,325
Then why are you here?

1307
02:10:32,867 --> 02:10:33,959
<i>I want to see my mother.</i>

1308
02:10:34,435 --> 02:10:35,766
- You cannot.
- 1 will?

1309
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:44,769
If Mummy says she won't see me, if
she doesn't want to meet Pallavi...

1310
02:10:45,078 --> 02:10:47,206
if she doesn't want to see
me happy, I'll go away.

1311
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:52,043
You won't see your mother until
you've severed ties with that girl.

1312
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:55,018
I'd like my mother
to say that.

1313
02:10:55,422 --> 02:10:57,151
Aren't you ashamed?!

1314
02:10:58,325 --> 02:11:01,317
Some girl you met yesterday
means more to you than...

1315
02:11:01,495 --> 02:11:03,088
the woman who bore you!

1316
02:11:03,397 --> 02:11:04,956
What use seeing your mother?

1317
02:11:05,165 --> 02:11:06,792
1 have to see her... I must?!

1318
02:11:07,001 --> 02:11:08,491
<i>I know she will agree!</i>

1319
02:11:08,836 --> 02:11:10,804
- Your mother won't!
- If she does...

1320
02:11:10,971 --> 02:11:12,962
I don't have to care for
anyone else! Not even you!

1321
02:11:13,374 --> 02:11:16,207
- She doesn't want to see you!
- I don't believe you!

1322
02:11:16,477 --> 02:11:18,172
- I told you so!
- What are you doing, Daddy?

1323
02:11:18,379 --> 02:11:19,778
- Get out of here!
- What's going on?

1324
02:11:20,748 --> 02:11:22,477
Why are you so adamant, Inder?

1325
02:11:22,816 --> 02:11:25,842
You cannot see me
till you have left her.

1326
02:11:26,587 --> 02:11:28,453
<i>That is what I told your father.</i>

1327
02:11:28,856 --> 02:11:32,622
<i>What he has told you
is what I have decided.</i>

1328
02:11:33,027 --> 02:11:35,189
Beg me if you want.
But you cannot change my mind.

1329
02:11:40,667 --> 02:11:43,932
Why don't you understand, Inder?!

1330
02:11:44,505 --> 02:11:47,941
This is a disaster!
We can't condone that!

1331
02:11:48,342 --> 02:11:52,540
What we have decided
is for your sake!

1332
02:11:58,752 --> 02:12:04,088
You are lost, my son!
But there is still time!

1333
02:12:04,692 --> 02:12:06,820
Any longer, and you'll reach
the point of no-return.

1334
02:12:07,294 --> 02:12:11,322
Apologize to her.
And send her home.

1335
02:12:11,899 --> 02:12:13,924
No, Mummy.

1336
02:12:16,804 --> 02:12:19,705
A son loves no one
more than his mother.

1337
02:12:20,708 --> 02:12:21,937
I love you.

1338
02:12:23,644 --> 02:12:27,979
Pallavi loves her mother
and her brothers too.

1339
02:12:29,316 --> 02:12:33,753
She has left everything behind.
For my sake.

1340
02:12:34,388 --> 02:12:35,753
<i>How can I abandon her?</i>

1341
02:12:37,291 --> 02:12:45,291
But if you will not accept it,
1 have no right to stay here.

1342
02:12:47,201 --> 02:12:48,259
I'm leaving.

1343
02:12:48,936 --> 02:12:50,233
<i>Inder! I won't let you go!</i>

1344
02:12:50,538 --> 02:12:51,300
- Don't stop me!
- You can't!

1345
02:12:51,505 --> 02:12:52,563
- Please! Let me go!
- 1 won't let you go!

1346
02:12:52,906 --> 02:12:54,465
- What are you doing?!
- Stop! Inder! Come home!

1347
02:12:54,708 --> 02:12:56,142
- Don't go away!
- Let go of him!

1348
02:12:56,377 --> 02:12:59,574
You're behaving like a child!
Let him go!

1349
02:12:59,814 --> 02:13:02,181
We aren't sending him away.
He's leaving us.

1350
02:13:02,383 --> 02:13:04,442
He's an adult.
He must decide for himself.

1351
02:13:04,751 --> 02:13:05,843
Let him go.

1352
02:13:28,042 --> 02:13:30,306
Why are you looking at me
like that?

1353
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:34,273
<i>Have I said anything wrong?</i>

1354
02:13:38,185 --> 02:13:42,554
Don't worry.
I know Inder.

1355
02:13:43,925 --> 02:13:47,327
He will send her home.
And he is going to come back to us.

1356
02:13:47,928 --> 02:13:48,986
He will.

1357
02:13:54,935 --> 02:13:57,996
There is going to be trouble
if you aren't careful.

1358
02:13:58,472 --> 02:14:00,440
Her brother is a policeman.

1359
02:14:00,941 --> 02:14:05,572
He'll complain in court.
For holding a woman against her will.

1360
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:08,141
He'll have all of you
thrown in jail.

1361
02:14:09,083 --> 02:14:12,383
So tell me man,
what are we supposed to do?

1362
02:14:12,887 --> 02:14:16,414
A marriage.
Let's have the marriage registered.

1363
02:14:17,158 --> 02:14:20,219
Once the marriage is registered...

1364
02:14:20,528 --> 02:14:22,895
neither the police nor the courts
can do anything.

1365
02:14:23,797 --> 02:14:26,357
Can we get the registrar
of marriages here?

1366
02:14:28,302 --> 02:14:30,327
How many registrars
do you want?

1367
02:14:30,671 --> 02:14:36,940
Tomorrow, I'll get you one.
Trussed up, if I have to.

1368
02:14:37,278 --> 02:14:38,803
- That okay?
- Perfect

1369
02:14:46,187 --> 02:14:47,120
Here you are.

1370
02:14:47,655 --> 02:14:49,054
- What is it?
- A wedding dress.

1371
02:14:49,256 --> 02:14:50,746
A gift from friends.

1372
02:14:50,992 --> 02:14:53,723
Get ready, Inder.
The marriage registrar is coming.

1373
02:14:54,094 --> 02:14:57,120
Once this marriage is done,
we will get some breathing space.

1374
02:14:57,665 --> 02:15:00,327
What are you waiting for?
Get the flowers. Go on.

1375
02:15:18,418 --> 02:15:19,579
<i>Shall I get dressed?</i>

1376
02:15:22,556 --> 02:15:27,494
Will you sit beside me
for a while?

1377
02:15:36,537 --> 02:15:39,666
You look sad.

1378
02:15:40,374 --> 02:15:42,866
You don't look happy either.

1379
02:15:44,745 --> 02:15:47,112
I've seen it in you.

1380
02:15:49,283 --> 02:15:50,546
<i>Yes. I think I know.</i>

1381
02:15:57,925 --> 02:15:59,086
What is happening to us?

1382
02:16:02,797 --> 02:16:03,855
I don't know.

1383
02:16:08,836 --> 02:16:10,270
Are you unhappy
about the marriage?

1384
02:16:10,671 --> 02:16:18,203
<i>No. It's just that I would've liked
my mother and my brothers...</i>

1385
02:16:18,446 --> 02:16:26,446
to be with me at this moment.
That is what I wanted.

1386
02:16:36,030 --> 02:16:44,030
<i>You are right. I wanted
my parents to be here too.</i>

1387
02:16:46,774 --> 02:16:48,674
Why are they doing this to us?

1388
02:16:51,312 --> 02:16:53,246
Have we committed so grave a sin?

1389
02:16:56,317 --> 02:17:01,585
We didn't do anything intentionally.
It just happened.

1390
02:17:04,058 --> 02:17:05,787
Won't they forgive us?

1391
02:17:07,962 --> 02:17:09,396
They won't.

1392
02:17:11,598 --> 02:17:15,034
They are possessive.

1393
02:17:17,171 --> 02:17:18,832
Maybe that's why.

1394
02:17:21,309 --> 02:17:25,974
What did your mother
tell you yesterday?

1395
02:17:27,047 --> 02:17:32,281
Mummy said she won't allow
a disaster to happen.

1396
02:17:32,887 --> 02:17:33,854
She is right.

1397
02:17:38,192 --> 02:17:43,221
To be refused by the one
she loves most... her son.

1398
02:17:45,933 --> 02:17:48,368
What could hurt her more?

1399
02:17:53,641 --> 02:17:57,475
<i>Can I ask you something?</i>

1400
02:18:01,816 --> 02:18:03,341
Go on.

1401
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:07,454
Should we...

1402
02:18:10,324 --> 02:18:18,324
should we separate?
Yes.

1403
02:18:27,775 --> 02:18:28,936
What did you say?!

1404
02:18:30,444 --> 02:18:31,605
Yes.

1405
02:18:33,514 --> 02:18:34,743
<i>That is just what I said.</i>

1406
02:18:37,818 --> 02:18:40,685
My Pallavi must be happy.
Always.

1407
02:18:42,222 --> 02:18:44,520
For my sake,
you must never be unhappy.

1408
02:18:46,727 --> 02:18:49,458
You love me very much,
don't you?

1409
02:18:51,565 --> 02:18:52,964
You too?

1410
02:18:55,002 --> 02:18:56,265
Me too.

1411
02:19:07,915 --> 02:19:11,715
You'll go back home,
won't you?

1412
02:19:14,355 --> 02:19:15,720
I will.

1413
02:19:16,957 --> 02:19:20,860
You must ask your mother
to forgive me.

1414
02:19:22,530 --> 02:19:23,827
I will.

1415
02:19:24,198 --> 02:19:27,600
Tell her that I've given
her son back to her.

1416
02:19:29,737 --> 02:19:30,533
I will.

1417
02:19:34,241 --> 02:19:37,768
Now I'm not unhappy anymore.

1418
02:19:40,047 --> 02:19:41,845
You aren't unhappy, are you?

1419
02:19:44,518 --> 02:19:45,644
Neither you.

1420
02:19:46,887 --> 02:19:47,877
Promise?

1421
02:19:50,391 --> 02:19:53,122
Promise.

1422
02:19:58,365 --> 02:19:59,491
Call the kids.

1423
02:19:59,967 --> 02:20:01,992
- The registrar is here.
- All right.

1424
02:20:02,636 --> 02:20:05,298
Peter... get the kids here.

1425
02:20:07,607 --> 02:20:10,304
- Are we having a party tonight?
- Sure.

1426
02:20:16,851 --> 02:20:18,182
Please be seated, sir.

1427
02:20:20,887 --> 02:20:22,252
- A cold drink, sir?
- No.

1428
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:25,815
Where are the kids?
Call them. Hurry.

1429
02:20:27,895 --> 02:20:31,195
What is this?!
They aren't ready!

1430
02:20:40,974 --> 02:20:42,738
We don't want to marry.

1431
02:20:45,579 --> 02:20:46,740
We are breaking up.

1432
02:20:51,618 --> 02:20:54,349
Have you decided
not to marry?

1433
02:20:55,723 --> 02:21:00,183
Yes. It's mutual.

1434
02:21:00,527 --> 02:21:02,222
What nonsense is this?

1435
02:21:02,696 --> 02:21:04,186
You didn't even ask them!

1436
02:21:04,632 --> 02:21:06,566
Why did you put me through
all this trouble?

1437
02:21:07,101 --> 02:21:10,127
Please wait, sir!

1438
02:21:10,771 --> 02:21:13,741
They don't want to marry.
What's your worry?

1439
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:28,884
I tried to bring you together.

1440
02:21:33,927 --> 02:21:35,361
You made a promise, didn't you?

1441
02:21:35,763 --> 02:21:36,787
Didn't you?!

1442
02:21:37,998 --> 02:21:38,988
They why?

1443
02:21:39,633 --> 02:21:41,032
What is all this about?

1444
02:21:44,971 --> 02:21:46,632
<i>I don't understand a thing!</i>

1445
02:21:47,007 --> 02:21:48,406
Not a thing!

1446
02:21:50,044 --> 02:21:54,845
You shouldn't have insulted me
like this!

1447
02:21:55,382 --> 02:21:57,544
This is wrong! Very wrong of you!

1448
02:21:57,784 --> 02:21:59,047
<i>I will not let you do this!
Never!</i>

1449
02:21:59,253 --> 02:22:00,948
You have deceived us!
And we lost sleep over you!

1450
02:22:14,335 --> 02:22:15,598
You understand me. You do.

1451
02:22:18,372 --> 02:22:19,305
Not a word!

1452
02:22:20,207 --> 02:22:21,504
I don't want to hear a word!

1453
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:24,600
You've insulted us
in front of everyone!

1454
02:22:25,880 --> 02:22:28,110
Just like a true friend!

1455
02:22:28,649 --> 02:22:32,085
You should have told me
it's like this!

1456
02:22:32,819 --> 02:22:34,787
I wouldn't have
brought you here!

1457
02:22:50,137 --> 02:22:54,665
You know how much
Inder loves me.

1458
02:22:57,711 --> 02:23:00,942
More than you,
we grieve this.

1459
02:23:02,650 --> 02:23:08,419
We have people at home.
They are good folks.

1460
02:23:09,656 --> 02:23:11,556
And they love us.
Just as you do.

1461
02:23:12,827 --> 02:23:17,230
They have raised us with
great expectations.

1462
02:23:18,365 --> 02:23:21,130
They have hopes for us.
They have their dreams.

1463
02:23:21,836 --> 02:23:29,836
Is it right of us to be so selfish?

1464
02:23:37,184 --> 02:23:40,620
Can you hurt your family?

1465
02:23:53,667 --> 02:23:57,501
Could you do this to your father?

1466
02:24:03,777 --> 02:24:05,302
Inder loves me very much.

1467
02:24:08,816 --> 02:24:11,547
That's why he is sending me back.

1468
02:24:13,153 --> 02:24:16,487
We are sacrificing our loves
for the sakes of our families.

1469
02:24:16,857 --> 02:24:21,727
You should support us.

1470
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:30,669
I haven't a father.

1471
02:24:32,906 --> 02:24:35,739
You have been like
a father to me.

1472
02:24:37,845 --> 02:24:39,210
Give me your blessings.

1473
02:24:40,347 --> 02:24:43,009
And please send me home.

1474
02:24:47,288 --> 02:24:55,127
I am the one who
should be apologizing.

1475
02:24:57,998 --> 02:24:59,432
I understand!

1476
02:25:01,034 --> 02:25:02,763
<i>Now I understand you!</i>

1477
02:25:05,405 --> 02:25:12,175
Blessed are your parents! To have
good children like you! Bless them!

1478
02:25:17,518 --> 02:25:21,386
<i>I was taken aback when I heard you.</i>

1479
02:25:22,723 --> 02:25:26,887
But now...l salute your decision.

1480
02:25:28,762 --> 02:25:31,959
What a lesson for every child!

1481
02:25:35,302 --> 02:25:38,636
I cannot say more.

1482
02:25:40,074 --> 02:25:44,204
You are adults.

1483
02:25:45,246 --> 02:25:46,441
You are mature.

1484
02:25:47,381 --> 02:25:49,679
Maybe more mature than your years.

1485
02:25:52,086 --> 02:25:53,713
Never mind all that.

1486
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:57,783
Do whatever you feel best.

1487
02:26:01,795 --> 02:26:03,923
Go on.

1488
02:26:21,682 --> 02:26:28,713
Inder, I hit you.
Forgive me, my friend.

1489
02:26:29,890 --> 02:26:31,051
- Forgive me!
- Not

1490
02:26:31,859 --> 02:26:32,724
What are you saying?!

1491
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:41,191
Go on. Drop Pallavi home.

1492
02:26:55,482 --> 02:26:59,885
I'm leaving. You'll drop by
to see me sometimes, won't you?

1493
02:27:31,385 --> 02:27:32,181
What is it, Suraj?

1494
02:27:32,419 --> 02:27:34,387
We have the court order.

1495
02:27:34,722 --> 02:27:37,555
That scoundrel!
He's going to be jailed!

1496
02:27:37,824 --> 02:27:40,020
And we'll drag Pallavi home!

1497
02:27:40,961 --> 02:27:42,190
Drag her, where?

1498
02:27:44,899 --> 02:27:47,197
Don't you make the mistake
of bringing her here!

1499
02:27:47,535 --> 02:27:49,503
<i>She mustn't step
inside this house!</i>

1500
02:27:50,371 --> 02:27:53,898
Send her to a home for destitute.

1501
02:27:55,142 --> 02:27:57,941
The doors of this house
are closed for her. Forever.

1502
02:28:38,786 --> 02:28:40,550
I swear by the soul of our father.

1503
02:28:41,922 --> 02:28:44,482
I am pure. In body. And in soul.

1504
02:28:44,825 --> 02:28:46,418
1 have not sinned.

1505
02:28:47,761 --> 02:28:49,752
1 have left it all behind.

1506
02:28:50,130 --> 02:28:51,325
Forgive me

1507
02:28:59,173 --> 02:29:02,905
I knew! You'd never do
anything wrong!

1508
02:29:04,311 --> 02:29:06,006
<i>I know you'll never hurt us.</i>

1509
02:29:09,216 --> 02:29:12,151
But what came over you?

1510
02:29:12,686 --> 02:29:14,882
Why did you do such a thing?

1511
02:29:16,123 --> 02:29:17,591
Won't you forgive me?

1512
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:22,594
Oh, but you're the light
of this family!

1513
02:29:47,955 --> 02:29:52,392
You needn't say anything.

1514
02:29:53,193 --> 02:29:57,653
My daughter is come home!
My darling!

1515
02:30:59,727 --> 02:31:03,288
1 told you?
Inder would come back!?

1516
02:31:03,764 --> 02:31:04,925
Here he is!

1517
02:31:16,710 --> 02:31:20,078
Forgot Daddy, did you?
Forgot your Daddy!

1518
02:31:21,948 --> 02:31:23,438
- Daddy, it hurts.
- Hurts, does it?

1519
02:31:24,718 --> 02:31:26,982
And what about me?
What about the way you hurt me?

1520
02:31:27,455 --> 02:31:29,549
You had me scared!

1521
02:31:31,625 --> 02:31:34,060
Now will you ever leave me?!

1522
02:31:38,298 --> 02:31:40,096
You're going nowhere!

1523
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:23,488
Find a boy!

1524
02:35:24,157 --> 02:35:26,558
And get her married.
As soon as you can.

1525
02:35:27,895 --> 02:35:29,659
As soon as you can!

1526
02:35:34,168 --> 02:35:36,796
Pallavi's marriage is the
most important item on the agenda.

1527
02:35:37,504 --> 02:35:39,700
- How can we rush into this?
- I don't caret!

1528
02:35:40,140 --> 02:35:41,608
She must be married off!

1529
02:35:42,142 --> 02:35:46,045
The sooner the better!

1530
02:35:48,349 --> 02:35:50,340
She jokes with you.
She sings with you.

1531
02:35:50,818 --> 02:35:53,412
But the fire still burns
within her.

1532
02:35:54,521 --> 02:35:56,114
Unless the fire is quenched...

1533
02:35:56,390 --> 02:36:00,122
I can never rest in peace.
Keep that in mind.

1534
02:36:08,635 --> 02:36:10,831
Just tell me which
of these you like.

1535
02:36:11,104 --> 02:36:13,038
Don't ask me.
And don't ask anyone else.

1536
02:36:13,574 --> 02:36:16,771
<i>The girl you choose is going to be
the best for me. I know that.</i>

1537
02:36:24,384 --> 02:36:25,351
This is tough!

1538
02:36:25,752 --> 02:36:26,878
Listen... sit here.

1539
02:36:27,855 --> 02:36:30,222
- What is it?
- Help me choose a girl.

1540
02:36:30,491 --> 02:36:32,550
No. You must do it.
It's your prerogative.

1541
02:36:33,093 --> 02:36:35,653
He even asked you
not to ask anyone.

1542
02:36:35,929 --> 02:36:38,523
Now, how do I...

1543
02:36:40,768 --> 02:36:41,462
Wait...

1544
02:36:42,736 --> 02:36:48,175
<i>I haven't seen Pallavi.
You saw her.</i>

1545
02:36:49,510 --> 02:36:51,274
See if you can find
someone like her.

1546
02:36:51,512 --> 02:36:56,643
<i>As far as I am concerned,
she's going to be good enough.</i>

1547
02:36:57,117 --> 02:36:59,176
Our son has given his heart
to Pallavi.

1548
02:36:59,453 --> 02:37:03,856
There's only one reason
why he left her.

1549
02:37:04,025 --> 02:37:06,551
He loves you more than
he loves her.

1550
02:37:08,062 --> 02:37:12,693
If you want to reciprocate...

1551
02:37:12,967 --> 02:37:18,872
you must find him a girl
better than Pallavi.

1552
02:37:19,873 --> 02:37:23,138
And remember, it's your duty.

1553
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:43,697
- What is the matter, Suraj?
- We have won the day!

1554
02:37:43,731 --> 02:37:46,632
We can have our sister married off
as soon as you please!

1555
02:37:47,935 --> 02:37:52,372
Thank God! You have
answered my prayers!

1556
02:37:55,042 --> 02:37:56,601
The boy is brilliant.

1557
02:37:56,977 --> 02:37:58,775
You are lucky, Pallavi.

1558
02:38:00,247 --> 02:38:03,808
Now who is he?

1559
02:38:04,185 --> 02:38:08,816
Words of praise aren't
enough for him!

1560
02:38:09,223 --> 02:38:11,851
He's coming to see our princess.
You can meet him for yourself.

1561
02:38:12,059 --> 02:38:14,858
He will surely like our princess.
And Pallavi will like him too.

1562
02:38:15,896 --> 02:38:18,024
All that is left is
the formal introduction.

1563
02:38:18,465 --> 02:38:20,092
When is that?

1564
02:38:20,334 --> 02:38:21,324
Next Sunday.

1565
02:38:21,669 --> 02:38:25,299
At last we have found a
prince for our princess!

1566
02:38:28,342 --> 02:38:30,834
Look at her! The princess is shy!

1567
02:38:56,503 --> 02:38:59,200
This chain belongs to Pallavi.

1568
02:39:01,608 --> 02:39:03,599
<i>How do I give it back to her?</i>

1569
02:39:17,091 --> 02:39:20,959
Pallavi is getting married.
We just got to know.

1570
02:39:22,596 --> 02:39:24,928
The fellow is an engineer
settled in America.

1571
02:39:26,066 --> 02:39:28,933
After the marriage, Pallavi is
going to settle in America.

1572
02:39:35,176 --> 02:39:36,007
Come here.

1573
02:39:40,281 --> 02:39:45,378
I want Inder to marry
before that girl does.

1574
02:39:45,652 --> 02:39:47,177
Why?

1575
02:39:48,488 --> 02:39:53,551
<i>Can't I go there to
return the chain?</i>

1576
02:39:54,328 --> 02:39:55,261
Why?

1577
02:39:58,765 --> 02:40:05,432
I want to see Pallavi.

1578
02:40:07,541 --> 02:40:10,533
I want to see the girl
who won my son's heart.

1579
02:40:11,412 --> 02:40:14,109
<i>Pallavi. I want to meet her. Once.</i>

1580
02:40:15,783 --> 02:40:21,222
<i>You even told me that
I must find a better girl.</i>

1581
02:40:22,222 --> 02:40:25,886
Please take me over. We have
an excuse. This chain.

1582
02:40:26,293 --> 02:40:34,030
And then I'll find
a better girl for our Inder.

1583
02:40:34,935 --> 02:40:37,165
Take me there. Please.

1584
02:41:14,575 --> 02:41:15,542
Good morning.

1585
02:41:17,744 --> 02:41:19,678
May we come in?

1586
02:41:22,883 --> 02:41:26,444
We heard about a marriage.

1587
02:41:29,156 --> 02:41:33,593
Pallavi had a necklace.
It was lying with Inder.

1588
02:41:34,595 --> 02:41:35,926
We just got to know.

1589
02:41:37,731 --> 02:41:41,326
So we thought we would
return the chain.

1590
02:41:43,671 --> 02:41:49,371
And I'd like to apologize for the
inconvenience Inder has caused you.

1591
02:41:52,379 --> 02:41:53,938
Oh that was minor.
Please step inside.

1592
02:41:57,084 --> 02:42:01,112
The other day we were very upset.
And we spoke to you very rudely.

1593
02:42:01,421 --> 02:42:03,446
I wanted to apologize
to you for it.

1594
02:42:04,324 --> 02:42:05,120
Please step in.

1595
02:42:20,107 --> 02:42:23,236
Inder's parents.

1596
02:42:27,047 --> 02:42:28,412
Why, you're still standing.
Please be seated.

1597
02:42:28,849 --> 02:42:29,611
Please be seated.

1598
02:42:30,317 --> 02:42:31,250
Please come with me.

1599
02:42:32,052 --> 02:42:34,578
Sit down, children.

1600
02:42:39,326 --> 02:42:39,792
Welcome.

1601
02:42:42,096 --> 02:42:43,029
Please be seated.

1602
02:42:43,764 --> 02:42:47,359
Go on. Attend the guests.

1603
02:42:47,835 --> 02:42:50,167
Pallavi... get some sherbet
for the guests.

1604
02:42:52,439 --> 02:42:53,668
Sit down. Please.

1605
02:42:55,943 --> 02:42:58,378
You are the first guests
since the marriage was announced.

1606
02:43:17,498 --> 02:43:19,023
Is the date decided?

1607
02:43:19,433 --> 02:43:20,059
What?

1608
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:22,732
The date of the marriage?

1609
02:43:23,537 --> 02:43:24,561
No.

1610
02:43:25,773 --> 02:43:27,639
The boy is in a hurry.

1611
02:43:28,875 --> 02:43:30,070
Maybe by next Thursday.

1612
02:43:32,112 --> 02:43:33,511
They have just arrived
from America.

1613
02:43:50,965 --> 02:43:55,300
This chain belongs to Pallavi.
Inder had it.

1614
02:44:00,140 --> 02:44:04,668
My son was very foolish.
He put you through a lot of trouble.

1615
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:09,948
1 apologize for him.
Please forgive him.

1616
02:44:10,317 --> 02:44:16,745
Why bring up bygones?
It was trouble for both of us.

1617
02:44:18,959 --> 02:44:26,959
1 pray to God for the strength
that we may forget it all.

1618
02:44:37,478 --> 02:44:39,139
<i>I have not even seen your son.</i>

1619
02:44:40,381 --> 02:44:42,145
Which one is he?

1620
02:44:48,455 --> 02:44:50,287
Pallavi's mother wants to meet you.

1621
02:45:12,112 --> 02:45:13,375
May you be happy.

1622
02:45:17,251 --> 02:45:18,878
It wasn't Pallavi's fault.

1623
02:45:20,254 --> 02:45:21,915
It was all my fault.

1624
02:45:23,423 --> 02:45:24,549
1 apologize.

1625
02:45:25,025 --> 02:45:27,119
Don't say that.

1626
02:45:28,061 --> 02:45:29,859
You have given my daughter
back to us.

1627
02:45:30,697 --> 02:45:33,598
<i>I should be thanking you for this.</i>

1628
02:45:37,304 --> 02:45:40,467
You mustn't be unhappy.

1629
02:45:42,175 --> 02:45:45,372
Whatever be the reasons,
what has happened has happened.

1630
02:45:52,319 --> 02:45:57,348
Pallavi insists that the first one
to be invited to her marriage...

1631
02:45:57,658 --> 02:46:01,424
must be your mother.

1632
02:46:11,438 --> 02:46:13,338
Be seated. Please.

1633
02:48:28,976 --> 02:48:31,570
Have you come to marry Aunt Pallavi?

1634
02:48:35,349 --> 02:48:36,180
No.

1635
02:48:36,617 --> 02:48:37,778
Then why are you here?

1636
02:48:38,419 --> 02:48:39,079
Out!

1637
02:48:40,253 --> 02:48:41,220
Get out of here.

1638
02:48:49,363 --> 02:48:51,855
You will excuse us now...

1639
02:48:52,199 --> 02:48:56,261
It was nice meeting all of you.

1640
02:49:03,544 --> 02:49:04,272
Shall we...

1641
02:49:12,753 --> 02:49:14,016
1 shall be leaving.

1642
02:49:22,196 --> 02:49:25,029
You did not even speak
to my daughter.

1643
02:49:35,276 --> 02:49:40,009
After you are gone, my daughter
is going to break down.

1644
02:49:40,314 --> 02:49:42,009
<i>I won't be able to bear that.</i>

1645
02:49:42,349 --> 02:49:43,817
She is getting married.

1646
02:49:44,852 --> 02:49:48,288
You will bless her, won't you?

1647
02:50:10,744 --> 02:50:12,109
<i>What am I to bless her with?</i>

1648
02:50:13,814 --> 02:50:15,282
<i>With what words do I say it?</i>

1649
02:50:16,817 --> 02:50:18,444
She's my daughter!

1650
02:50:19,386 --> 02:50:21,218
Why don't you give her to me?!

1651
02:50:22,690 --> 02:50:24,055
1 will take care of her?

1652
02:50:24,392 --> 02:50:26,292
Give her to me! Please!

1653
02:50:31,365 --> 02:50:32,230
Take her.

1654
02:50:35,402 --> 02:50:36,528
Take her away.

1655
02:50:38,739 --> 02:50:43,404
Let her have the man she wants.

1656
02:50:45,979 --> 02:50:46,912
What did you say?!

1657
02:50:47,381 --> 02:50:48,143
Yes.

1658
02:50:48,782 --> 02:50:50,682
This only a mother can see.

1659
02:50:53,320 --> 02:51:01,320
Do you not see how she
holds back her tears?

1660
02:51:06,033 --> 02:51:10,163
She wants this. Let it happen.

1661
02:51:11,872 --> 02:51:14,807
<i>- That's what I wanted to tell you!
- Yes, Mummy!</i>

1662
02:51:15,676 --> 02:51:17,440
<i>That's what I wanted to say too!</i>

1663
02:51:23,217 --> 02:51:24,150
My darling!

1664
02:51:36,296 --> 02:51:38,890
I made you unhappy, didn't 17

1665
02:51:45,339 --> 02:51:47,740
I'd never find a better girl
for Inder would 17

1666
02:51:48,375 --> 02:51:49,001
Never.

1667
02:51:50,010 --> 02:51:51,569
Now what is it?

1668
02:51:52,246 --> 02:51:53,407
What are you staring at me for?

1669
02:51:53,914 --> 02:51:56,246
Go on. Ask for your girl!

1670
02:51:56,650 --> 02:51:59,813
No. Never.

1671
02:52:01,121 --> 02:52:02,885
You can't take her away
just like that.

1672
02:52:03,657 --> 02:52:04,783
We give her the send-off.

1673
02:52:06,393 --> 02:52:08,885
Take good care of our sister.

1674
02:52:11,532 --> 02:52:14,058
You have your bride.

1675
02:52:14,735 --> 02:52:16,965
Nothing to stop you.
Nothing to hold you back.

1676
02:52:17,271 --> 02:52:19,035
You are free.
And the world is yours!

1677
02:52:21,342 --> 02:52:23,242
Why are you fellows
standing there?

1678
02:52:23,577 --> 02:52:25,671
You have a part to play,
don't you?

1679
02:52:26,246 --> 02:52:27,441
Come on.
