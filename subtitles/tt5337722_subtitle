1
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,995
Has Thambi Sir arrived?
- Yes.

2
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:49,028
Come, Sir.

3
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,933
He's waiting foryou.
- He's in his room, right?

4
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:52,966
Yes.

5
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,605
No!

6
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:09,214
Thambi Sir,

7
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,518
Thambi Sir?

8
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,154
lt's me, Chandran.

9
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:19,294
l've brought that special
item you had asked for.

10
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:22,595
Thambi Sir?

11
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:53,494
Chandran,

12
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,197
Thambi is no more.

13
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:25,495
On that day, an ordinay criminal
called Ramakrishnan Bonakkad,

14
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:29,433
transformed into
Rambo, the famous Don.

15
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:29,529
And Rambo believed firmly that,

16
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:35,205
no one or no weapon in this
world could defeat him!

17
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:37,539
But to kill Rambo,

18
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,409
someone was born on the same day!

19
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:45,183
On that day when Ramakrishnan
Bonakkad became Rambo.

20
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,639
Any relatives of Lakshmi here?

21
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:15,746
l asked if any relatives
of Lakshmi are here?

22
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,319
ls there anyone?

23
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:33,698
l didn't see anyone outside.

24
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,336
You have to enter the child's
name in the register.

25
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:39,271
Have you thought of a name?

26
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:45,644
Bharat.

27
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:52,888
Even though this little child was sent
by God as Rambo's killer,

28
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:57,660
the weapon he needs to kill him,
was given to him by his mother!

29
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:18,714
'Muddugauv'
(THE KIss)

30
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,808
Hey!

31
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,544
Hey fatso!

32
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,114
l heard this external
examinor is one terror!

33
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,815
ls it?

34
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,752
A guy from the last
batch didn't survive!

35
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,621
She murdered eveyone
with herVIVA questions.

36
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,688
ls it?

37
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,757
Only emotional blackmail
will work out now.

38
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,092
ls it?

39
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,526
Shut up you fool!

40
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:44,799
Dude!

41
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:45,900
Hey Bharath!

42
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:47,602
ls this correct?

43
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,071
Not there. It's over there.

44
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:52,241
Here?
- There!!

45
00:12:57,245 --> 00:12:58,213
ls it ok now?

46
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:00,215
Thanks dude!

47
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:02,919
Shall we start the VIVA, teacher?
- Yes, we can!

48
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:05,788
Dude, diagram!

49
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:07,122
- Get lost!
Diagram!

50
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:16,833
Dude!

51
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,971
Show me the diagram and then go!

52
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:22,106
Dude, help me!
- It's the other diagram!

53
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:32,784
You know all the experiments, is it?

54
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:34,585
l mean..

55
00:13:34,718 --> 00:13:36,220
l heard you helping out others.

56
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,852
You don't even know that?

57
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:38,253
What are you studying for?

58
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,635
He might be tensed. Ifyou ask
him so_ly, he will answer.

59
00:14:58,674 --> 00:14:59,876
Are you tensed, Bharath?

60
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:01,945
Usually,

61
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:04,750
when you are tensed, what
do you do to overcome it?

62
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:06,950
l..

63
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:09,286
My mom..

64
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:12,391
Why are you talking about your
mom like little children?

65
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,227
lf l see my mom..

66
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:19,231
Forthe time being,
imagine l'm your mom.

67
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:20,732
You won't be tensed then, right?

68
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:22,166
Not really..

69
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:23,267
Then?

70
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:32,644
Tell me, Bharath!

71
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,948
('The Kiss')

72
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:59,808
So now we know what our VIVA
results are gonna be like!

73
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:02,077
Why the hell did l
feel like doing that!!

74
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:05,447
You feel like doing it all the time!
You don't even need a reason!

75
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:07,481
Don't make me hit you!

76
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,486
You screwed up even my experiment
which l was doing properly!

77
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:13,789
Shall we go meet the principal?

78
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:14,822
Yea right!

79
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:16,391
You're lucky you
didn't get suspension!

80
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,958
What do l do now?

81
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,694
There's nothing to do.

82
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:19,860
We have exactly one
month for the exams!

83
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:25,002
lfyou study properly, you can limit
the number of back papers (supplys).

84
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,750
- But how did my experiment flop?

85
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:42,152
Nice!!

86
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:44,387
Nice?

87
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,127
Yea dude!!

88
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:24,196
Dude!

89
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:27,434
l think they're talking about us.

90
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:31,572
Hey, she's coming here!!

91
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:38,078
Do you already know he_

92
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:38,577
No!

93
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:41,550
Tell me the truth. Is she coming to
take revenge for kissing her sometime?

94
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:42,883
Shut up you fool!

95
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:44,852
ls she coming here?

96
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:46,386
Don't turn back
even if she calls.

97
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,389
They're here!

98
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,438
l wanted to talkto this guy!

99
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:06,040
They want you!

100
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:31,204
Yourface has that special
quality l was looking for!

101
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,105
lf you don't mind,
can you help me?

102
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:01,429
lt's the main road to the
airport that has been blocked!

103
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:05,034
When is this going to get done?

104
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:08,439
Their bloody procession!

105
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:10,139
Are they iobless orwhat?

106
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,575
Sir!
- Has the m inister arrived?

107
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:14,411
No, Sir. Got a message
that he's on the way.

108
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:21,185
Didn't l tell you that the
road has been blocked!

109
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:23,722
- Sir must go this way!!
- Who is this 'Sir' ofyours?

110
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:26,591
You better move your car away from here.
- l can't.

111
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:27,991
What is it, Soman?

112
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:30,662
His 'Sir' must go there urgently it seems!
- Whom?

113
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,330
Just go to the car
behind this one.

114
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,212
Who is in such a hury?

115
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:47,445
lt's me.

116
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:53,986
Get out, you!!

117
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,329
Are you in a rush to get
your mom married or what?

118
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,131
Sir, no! No, Sir.
Sir, please!

119
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,299
Leave him, Sir.
He is a powemul man!

120
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:06,365
l don't care! Don't you
understand what l'm saying?

121
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,737
You get into the car, Sir.

122
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:09,802
Look at his bloody hair, goggles
and silver chain!!

123
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,208
What are you staring at?

124
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:20,748
Start the car!!
Go! Go!

125
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:26,089
l won't spare anyone who breaks
the law, whoever he may be!

126
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:27,656
Eveyone move that side!!
Sir, one minute!

127
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:27,788
What is it?

128
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,158
Sir, this will be a big problem!

129
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:31,259
You tell me the matter!

130
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:33,763
Sir, that's Rambo! He
is a big shot here!

131
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:36,165
He is vey influential among
the police and politicians!

132
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:37,465
Stop kidding man!

133
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,840
Sir, ifthis comes out in the media
as news, things will get messy!

134
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:44,206
Yes, Sir!
You do one thing!

135
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:46,343
Get all the material from
them and delete eveything!

136
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:00,757
- Will it be a problem?

137
00:22:02,225 --> 00:22:02,225
l couldn't sleep last night!
- Why?

138
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:05,762
A_er watching
'Chandanamazha' serial.

139
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:07,364
Oh! l didn't watch. What happened?

140
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:09,166
They sentAmritha to the forest!

141
00:22:09,398 --> 00:22:10,668
To the forest?
- Yea. Sheethal!

142
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:10,834
And the other one?

143
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:14,105
She is behind all this, right?
- Vanha! - Yea!

144
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:14,638
She didn't even give a glass
ofwaterto her own grandma!

145
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:18,510
Last week right?
- Yea! - Phew!

146
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:22,349
Now it can't be said if she'll be attacked
by tigen or elephants in the forest.

147
00:22:22,412 --> 00:22:23,816
They'll show it only next week.

148
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:26,486
Good that l didn't see it. Or
else, l would've died of grief.

149
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:26,618
'Sheddi' finance. They could've
kept so many other names!

150
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:31,557
He must've kept this name
because he doesn't have one.

151
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:33,226
lt's so dark here!

152
00:22:35,127 --> 00:22:37,231
We should buy a nice car like this one.

153
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:39,198
A_er doing some good wo_.

154
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:40,599
We'll have a blast a_erthat!

155
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:41,768
That's true!

156
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:47,875
What's that sound?
What's happening here?

157
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:49,575
Oh! It was you?

158
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:49,842
Did he pinch you again?

159
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,745
Pinch?
Where?

160
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:54,381
On her hand?
- Just a pinch?

161
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,217
ls Sir inside?

162
00:22:56,282 --> 00:22:57,250
Come!

163
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:05,359
Did you do what you
were sent to do?

164
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,428
lt's done! It was so much fun!

165
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:11,701
You told him that you broke
his arm for me, right?

166
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:11,765
Yes! Yes! We told him mice!!

167
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:14,936
Well done!

168
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,639
What did he say?

169
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:20,210
'Oh my God! Don't hit me!
Don't hit me!'

170
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,744
Did he cy like that?

171
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:23,914
Yea! Exactly!!

172
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:29,385
He asked us how much we
charged for our services.

173
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:30,953
And what did you say?

174
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,455
l said it was 10,OOO rupees!

175
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:34,656
Then what did he say?

176
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,298
He said he'll give us 20,OOO
ifwe broke both your arms!

177
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:43,900
Such fun, right?

178
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:46,938
And we told him we'll do
it, if he paid an advance!

Laugh!!
- Come on, laugh!!

180
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,644
You didn't take the
advance from him, right?

181
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,647
Hey! How can we do that!
Isn't that wrong?

182
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:57,916
We took the full amount!

183
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,786
Shall we start then?

184
00:24:02,252 --> 00:24:03,220
Laugh!

185
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:04,455

number of car deals in South India?

190
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:18,336
Yea!

Who's this Hyundai?
- This is Ramesh.

197
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:34,788
This car..
- This is my car!

198
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:39,393
Your car?
- Yes! - Come!

199
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,928
Ramesh,

200
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:44,431
until this car reached here,

201
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:45,833
it was yours.

202
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:47,368
But now, it is mine!

203
00:24:47,668 --> 00:24:48,703
Sir, but...

204
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:52,008
So ifyou want this car
in this same form,

205
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:54,042
you'll have to buy it from me!

206
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,511
A_er giving you an owner's discount,

207
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,845
it will be around Rs.10 lakhs!

208
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:03,486
So ifyou don't bring the
cash immediately,

209
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:05,988
you'll have to buy di_erent
parts ofthis car

210
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:08,692
from Tamil Nadu 8
Karnataka and elsewhere..

211
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,427
So.. See you then!

212
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,696
And yea,

213
00:25:14,829 --> 00:25:17,367
if you go to the police, l
won't pay their commission.

214
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:20,069
Tell me!

215
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:22,705
Rambo?

216
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:24,707
Police?

217
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:27,479
What happened?
- Live? Switch on the TV!

218
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:30,415
The incident occured during
the tra_ic regulation by the Police,

219
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:33,385
to facilitate the ministefs
'People Welfare March!'

220
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:37,424
The problems began when the famous
businessman Rambo was stopped on his way.

221
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:41,828
Cl Padmanabhan 8 co from Samudrakani
police
station were the ones who stopped Rambo.

222
00:25:42,425 --> 00:25:44,730
Rambo, who has influence in
the police 8 the government,

223
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:47,399
was stopped forcefully
by Cl Padmanabhan.

224
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:56,742
Forthe next few days, all the
meetings should be fixed here.

225
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:13,126
Ramakrishnan,

226
00:26:15,027 --> 00:26:17,832
Even you'd have forgotten
your original name now!

227
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,400
But there's a name you
would never forget.

228
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:21,801
Thambi.

229
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:23,871
My elder brother!

230
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:27,942
l was waiting patiently,
Ramakrishnan!

231
00:26:28,608 --> 00:26:30,678
For your downfall to begin.

232
00:26:31,177 --> 00:26:32,613
And l saw it today..

233
00:26:33,146 --> 00:26:35,751
Whoever you threatened and
built up this empire ofyours,

234
00:26:36,516 --> 00:26:38,119
they would all laugh at you!

235
00:26:38,752 --> 00:26:40,054
You will lose eveything,

236
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:43,560
and this Rambo will go back to being
the old Ramakrishnan Bonakkad.

237
00:26:44,525 --> 00:26:45,827
On that day, l
shall come.

238
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:47,463
To settle our scores!

239
00:26:47,528 --> 00:26:51,870
'Cl Padmanabhan tried to assault Rambo by
pulling him forcefully out ofthe car#

240
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:54,805
He said that no one can
influence the police;

241
00:26:54,969 --> 00:27:00,079
and that he had to take this action
because they were disrupting his duty.

242
00:27:00,175 --> 00:27:01,143
Disney,

243
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:02,944
l want him!

244
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:04,513
Thambi, right?
Done!

245
00:27:04,712 --> 00:27:05,681
No!

246
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:07,850
That policeman!

247
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,152
Padmanabhan!

248
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:12,922
l enquired about him.

249
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:14,658
His nickname is Padayappa.

250
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:16,994
Long back, when the movie
'Padayappa' released,

251
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,464
a bunch ofyoung kids beat
him up badly in the theater.

252
00:27:19,528 --> 00:27:21,834
That's how he got the name
- Padayappa.

253
00:27:33,877 --> 00:27:33,877
lt's better that we don't
do anything directly now.

254
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:37,715
The incident is still
a hot topic, right?

255
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:40,119
Let these channel guys cool down.

256
00:27:40,184 --> 00:27:42,187
He will fall right into our trap.

257
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,859
And then we can use a
frontman, and finish him!

258
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:51,964
One tight slap!

259
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:53,666
What's this mess on your face?

260
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,767
Mom!!

261
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:56,669
(Kisses)

262
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:01,742
So it was you who
was shown on TV?

263
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:03,243
On TV?

264
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:03,709
Didn't you see?

265
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,710
The first priM went to Ganga
- Bharath team.

266
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:06,578
How was your VIVA?

267
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:09,016
Vey nice!!

268
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:11,585
Full marks for sure!

269
00:28:12,218 --> 00:28:12,218
You said the same thing
Iast time as well.

270
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,120
There's just one month
Ieft for the final exams.

271
00:28:16,222 --> 00:28:17,224
Do remember that!

272
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,762
lfyou roam around
doing such paintjobs,

273
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:23,031
Don't wory, my dear mom!!

274
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:24,199
Go wash your face!

275
00:28:27,568 --> 00:28:28,569
Who's that girl?

276
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:29,036
Does she study with you?

277
00:28:30,137 --> 00:28:31,105
No!!

278
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:32,707
Found her on the road!

279
00:28:33,508 --> 00:28:35,545
Anyway, she looks
really graceful.

280
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:38,047
That graceful girl's name is
- Ganga.

281
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:41,551
Don't tell me you ended
up kissing her also!

282
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:42,183
Huh? Did that come on TV too?

283
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:44,753
No!

284
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:47,524
l stopped kissing people
whom l don't know.

285
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:49,259
That'll be good for you!

286
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,130
You don't have to get to know
people you don't know now!

287
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,768
No!!

288
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,681
Brother! Bro!!

289
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,288
What do you want?

290
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:22,023
Then move!

291
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:23,593
Let me complete this.

292
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:39,310
Why is eveyone doing
the same penon's face?

293
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:41,211
Why don't you sculpt
my face, Ganga?

294
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:44,416
Didn't you say that the face you
were searching for, was mine?

295
00:30:45,247 --> 00:30:46,718
This is our assignment!

296
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:48,720
And he is our model.
You please move!

297
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:49,653
Okay.

298
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:52,791
After this, can you
sculpt my face like this?

299
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:55,627
Stop disturbing me and leave!
Please!

300
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:56,826
l won't disturb you.

301
00:30:58,062 --> 00:30:59,431
l'll just say one
thing and leave.

302
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:00,631
What?

303
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:05,070
l liked you instantly
when l saw you that day!

304
00:31:05,202 --> 00:31:06,337
Even my mom likes you.

305
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:07,906
Mom saw us on TV.

306
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:12,113
And since you already like
me, shall we fix this?

307
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:14,779
Liked you?

308
00:31:14,946 --> 00:31:15,914
When?

309
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:17,149
What do you mean, when?

310
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:19,151
You were ogling at me
that day, right?

311
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:19,250
And then you met me and
said that my face is good;

312
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:21,419
and that you liked me! Didn't you?

313
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:24,724
l didn't mean it in that way!

314
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,789
What's the other meaning
for 'l like you'?

315
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:29,297
Do you know only one
meaning for 'l like you'?

316
00:31:29,461 --> 00:31:31,164
Then tell me the other meaning!

317
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:47,181
What's that?

318
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:48,917
Pick one ofthese.

319
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:50,017
l don't want to!

320
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,087
Then l won't leave from here.

321
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,089
Pick one!

322
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,971
So you like me!

323
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:49,781
'Remember this face?'

324
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:04,829
Evey good looking girl
will have one such friend!

325
00:33:07,098 --> 00:33:09,069
And she'll be the one who
screws up eveything!

326
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:10,904
We'll meet herwhen
this one's not there!

327
00:34:31,689 --> 00:34:32,657
Ganga,

328
00:34:34,192 --> 00:34:35,294
Ganga, look at me!

329
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:37,262
Yea! Tell me!

330
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:39,164
Look at me!

331
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:43,168
Did you see that couple?

332
00:34:44,468 --> 00:34:45,671
Don't look quickly.

333
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:47,105
Slowly..

334
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:04,090
Saw them?

335
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,260
Yes.
Why?

336
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:08,663
That couple is not that great, right?

337
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:10,364
Not as great as?

338
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:12,400
l mean.. as much as us!

339
00:35:12,631 --> 00:35:13,600
But,

340
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,469
we are not a couple, right?

341
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,038
No..

342
00:35:18,238 --> 00:35:19,975
But still, we aren't that bad either!

343
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:23,513
None ofyourtricks are going
to workwith me, dear!

344
00:35:26,013 --> 00:35:27,615
Then why don't you think this way?

345
00:35:28,015 --> 00:35:31,956
What are the chances of a guy
like me getting a girl like you?

346
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:36,191
Actually, this is an
interesting question.

347
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,292
See!

348
00:35:38,058 --> 00:35:39,195
So what are the chances?

349
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:42,397
Tell me!

350
00:35:46,635 --> 00:35:47,603
1110?

351
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:53,075
11100?

352
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,513
111000?

353
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,083
1110000?

354
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,218
No!

355
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:03,486
1 out of 1 lakh?

356
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:12,197
1 in ten million?

357
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,605
So there is a chance, right?

358
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:48,736
Son, can you li_ this for me?

359
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:50,638
Come! Please help me!

360
00:37:01,314 --> 00:37:02,282
Fine?
- Yes!

361
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:10,627
Don't follow me again
saying the same thing!

362
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:13,196
Give me a good reason
for not liking me?

363
00:37:14,328 --> 00:37:15,563
My dad won't allow!

364
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:17,632
All that's later, right?
l'll take care of it!

365
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:19,434
That's not for later..

366
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,270
That is my primay reason!

367
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:22,770
We don't have to get married
without your dad's permission!

368
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,510
But is that a reason
not to fall in love?

369
00:37:29,144 --> 00:37:31,848
No! But what if my dad objects
a_e we fall in love?

370
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:33,316
l will convince him!

371
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:35,285
Or else, we can wait
till he's convinced!

372
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:37,521
There are many other reasons as well!

373
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:39,222
Then tell me what they are!

374
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:42,093
Err.. You have many more
suppli exams to pass!

375
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:44,228
What good is an engineer
without 'supply's?

376
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,430
Give me another reason!

377
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:47,797
You're a fatso!

378
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,270
But my mom says that
l've lost weight!

379
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:54,672
All moms say that!

380
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:56,708
So will your problem be
over if l become slim?

381
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,444
There are many more reasons.

382
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:02,179
Then tell me, Ganga!

383
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,851
l don't remember any right now!

384
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,692
Until you say that you love me, l
will come and stand here daily!

385
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,727
l don't care if it's
10 days or 10 years!

386
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,264
Then l'll be 32 yean
old and you will be 30!

387
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,301
Son, can you please
put this down for me?

388
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:13,589
Titanic?

389
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:28,440
Such a big hotel and
such a small door?

390
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:32,509
Talk loudly man!

391
00:39:35,478 --> 00:39:36,446
For mo.

392
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:37,581
Be careful.

393
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:40,485
They hold our bags for
us in this hotel!

394
00:39:53,597 --> 00:39:54,967
Don't press it too hard.
It'll break!

395
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:56,235
lt's a breakable laptop.

396
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:58,303
lsn't it?

397
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:01,341
On which floor is it?
- 1 6th.

398
00:40:02,273 --> 00:40:03,743
So how many would be there?
- Huh?

399
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:16,889
Have you reached?

400
00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:21,596
When it's time, you'll get
a message on your mobile.

401
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:32,440
Don't move!

402
00:40:39,914 --> 00:40:40,882
Hey!

403
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:45,288
That's not a toy gun!
There're bullets in it!

404
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:47,255
ls it?

405
00:40:47,722 --> 00:40:49,692
Did he say who the guy was?
- No!

406
00:40:50,425 --> 00:40:52,495
Then will the person who
has to be shot come to us,

407
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,497
and say 'Shoot me! Shoot me'?

408
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:57,334
Didn't l tell you that this is an
actual gun? He said he will text us.

409
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:58,834
Oh. Okay.

410
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:01,705
We don't have a name,
photo or address!

411
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:01,903
Where will we go shoot him?

412
00:41:03,405 --> 00:41:06,545
lnternational deals are like this, man!
Eveything is conveyed through messages.

413
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:07,777
Since we are lucky,

414
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:11,083
the guy to be killed landed here
from Bombay and we got this job!

415
00:41:11,347 --> 00:41:11,347
That's why we got
such a big job!

416
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:14,618
Shouldn't we live like this?

417
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:16,487
lf so, we should've
asked 50k extra.

418
00:41:16,753 --> 00:41:18,723
That's true. But l
didn't think of it then.

419
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:20,090
The message has come!

420
00:41:21,057 --> 00:41:22,025
Where?

421
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:23,127
lt's ringing in your pocket!

422
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:25,930
Not my pocket!
- Then?

423
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:26,130
lt's in your pocket!
- Oh yea!

424
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:29,033
Sory! It was in my pocket!

425
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:30,836
l can't see anything!

426
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:34,940
David's friend is calling.

427
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:39,777
lt's not a toy gun!

428
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:40,945
Reached?

429
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:42,680
ln the li_?

430
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:46,019
He has reached!
Come!

431
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:47,954
l feel so tempted to shoot him!
Come!

432
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:07,542
l'll go back today itself.
- Why?

433
00:42:07,973 --> 00:42:09,610
Okay. See you in Bombay then.

434
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,449
lt's Rambo!

435
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,118
Him?

436
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:23,924
How are you?

437
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:34,770
- Long time, right?

438
00:42:36,871 --> 00:42:38,841
What do you have in your hand?
- Huh?

439
00:42:47,515 --> 00:42:49,019
There's iust one bullet.

440
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:55,625
So..

441
00:42:56,192 --> 00:42:57,694
aren't you going to finish me?

442
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,728
No!

443
00:43:01,231 --> 00:43:02,199
Who sent you?

444
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,469
Tell him the truth!

445
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:08,773
ls it him?

446
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,009
Me?

447
00:43:13,877 --> 00:43:15,680
l'm asking you.
Is it him?

448
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:19,652
ls it this bloody b___rd?

449
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:24,889
- Who got shot?

450
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:37,905
Are you leaving, Rambo?

451
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:39,540
Bro? The gun?

452
00:43:39,605 --> 00:43:41,542
Who will give us the
rest ofthe money?

453
00:43:53,085 --> 00:43:54,522
What are your names?

454
00:43:54,854 --> 00:43:57,225
He's Kumari and l am Putthari.

455
00:43:59,091 --> 00:43:59,091
l swear, we didn't
know who were going to kill,

456
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,465
until we got into the lift and
realized it was you, Sir.

457
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,500
Please let us go!

458
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,476
He's coming here!

459
00:44:19,747 --> 00:44:21,517
Don't stub that
cigarrette on us, please!

460
00:44:46,175 --> 00:44:47,745
Okay. l'll let you go!

461
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:48,812
You will?

462
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:52,583
Let Kutthari be here.

463
00:44:53,683 --> 00:44:54,952
Chaakkari, you go...

464
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:57,155
and bring this person l want.

465
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:06,664
North C.l.

466
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:08,801
Name - Padayappa.

467
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:11,839
Sir, we work together.
We've never wo_ed alone.

468
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:14,906
lsn't it?
- Yes.

469
00:45:15,673 --> 00:45:17,076
Okay. You both can go.

470
00:45:18,143 --> 00:45:20,213
Will he come, ifwe call him?

471
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:24,817
He should come!

472
00:45:26,184 --> 00:45:27,988
Phew! We got our lives back!

473
00:45:28,087 --> 00:45:29,957
Shall we escape without
going to the station?

474
00:45:30,122 --> 00:45:30,122
lfwe don't do what he said,
he will find us 8 kill us!

475
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,161
He won't show such mercy then!

476
00:45:34,227 --> 00:45:35,996
Don't scare me, man!!

477
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:37,932
This is a big trap we're in!

478
00:45:37,998 --> 00:45:37,998
Why does he have to make us call him?
Can't he call him directly?

479
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:41,034
No man! This is a plan, to kill that man!
- Plan?

480
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:43,202
lf we call him, we'll be the
ones who'll get caught!

481
00:45:45,772 --> 00:45:47,107
Remember David?
His same plan!

482
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:52,884
lf so, what ifwejoin the police's side
like we tricked David 8joined Rambo?

483
00:45:53,247 --> 00:45:55,651
Rambo is much more influential
than the police here.

484
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:59,223
Even ifwe join the police's side, we
can't trust them! They are frauds!

485
00:45:59,286 --> 00:46:00,656
Then what do we do?

486
00:46:01,088 --> 00:46:02,190
We'll see.
Come!

487
00:46:02,357 --> 00:46:04,159
l've lost my peace of mind!

488
00:46:04,225 --> 00:46:04,225
Ask for a li_!

489
00:46:05,226 --> 00:46:06,262
Hey, please stop!

490
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:07,228
- What is it, bro?
Can you give us a lift?

491
00:46:09,064 --> 00:46:11,601
Only mo people can go, right?
- Only mo are going!

492
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:14,638
Dude, what was his name?
Rajnikanth?

00:46:14,703 --> 00:46:15,671

494
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:16,906
Oh yea, Padayappa!

495
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:24,180
Where's the stand?

496
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,684
By the way, we don't
have to go in together. - Then?

497
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:26,783
l'll go.

498
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:27,784
Why should you go?

499
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,358
lf you go, you'll screw it up. l'll go,
call him nicely 8 come. You stay here!

500
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:34,157
Go!

501
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:45,236
What is this?

502
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:47,204
Sleeping centre?

503
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:52,710
Eveyone's sleeping, huh?

504
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,247
Bro!

505
00:46:58,683 --> 00:46:59,651
Hey, Sir!

00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:40,095
Oh! He's sleeping!

511
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:42,830
Sir,

512
00:47:42,997 --> 00:47:43,965
Padayappa?

513
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:49,104
Padayappa is your dad!!

514
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,173
What happened?
- Something blew up inside!

515
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,311
You got what you
asked for, right?

516
00:47:54,376 --> 00:47:56,279
Hey Kumaari. Padayappa
is his nickname.

517
00:47:56,344 --> 00:47:56,344
His original name
is Padmanabhan.

518
00:47:58,013 --> 00:48:00,517
Couldn't you tell me this earlier?
l could've avoided a slap.

519
00:48:00,883 --> 00:48:02,285
Padmanabhan Sir?

520
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:04,421

- Where's that, Sir?

521
00:48:05,988 --> 00:48:07,958
Hey, what's the matte_

00:48:09,158 --> 00:48:10,394
What's the matter?

524
00:48:10,526 --> 00:48:12,363

that Sirto someone.

525
00:48:12,861 --> 00:48:14,265
Take him to someone?
- Yes.

526
00:48:15,031 --> 00:48:16,166
To whom?
- Rambo!

527
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:19,336
Who?

528
00:48:19,836 --> 00:48:20,804
Rambo!

529
00:48:21,304 --> 00:48:24,310
- Haven't you heard about him?
Long, white hair and all..

530
00:48:25,276 --> 00:48:26,411
No, Sir.
Please!

531
00:48:40,891 --> 00:48:41,994

But l'll leave from
here only with him.

533
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,018
Did you get scared?

534
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:12,559
Can 3 people go on this?

535
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,098
That's ok. He's a policeman.
We can go triples!

536
00:49:24,872 --> 00:49:26,508
There's someone else
outside, along with him.

537
00:49:27,107 --> 00:49:27,107
Sir, didn't l tell you that day
itselfthat it'll be a big problem?

538
00:49:29,877 --> 00:49:31,213
They are Rambo's men!

539
00:49:31,512 --> 00:49:33,616
You do one thing.
Go home right away, Sir.

540
00:49:33,882 --> 00:49:35,084
l will handle them.

541
00:49:46,162 --> 00:49:48,399
Yea right! And then l will
be the one to get screwed!

542
00:50:10,587 --> 00:50:13,025
Where's he going?
- Start the bike!

543
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:11,252
Who are you?

544
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,223
Are you here to bribe Padayappa?

545
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:18,229
lfyou're here to bribe
Padayappa, then give it to me.

546
00:51:20,762 --> 00:51:23,134
Are you here to beat him?
Then do that directly!

547
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:28,338
Looks like he has set
his eyes on my bottle!

548
00:51:44,053 --> 00:51:46,591
Dude, Padayappa has escaped.
You come through the other side.

549
00:51:51,161 --> 00:51:52,129
Brother,

550
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:55,201
give him a couple of
extra poundings from me!

551
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,632
Hey Kumaari,

552
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,368
what the hell
happened over there?

553
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,471
This started off like
a Shaji Kailas film,

554
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:40,006
but now its like a
Priyadarshan film.

555
00:55:40,238 --> 00:55:41,941
l don't understand anything!

556
00:55:43,274 --> 00:55:44,477
ls he dead?

557
00:55:45,043 --> 00:55:46,413
Shall l go enquire?

558
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:48,882
Yea right! We don't know anything.
Let it be like that.

559
00:55:50,816 --> 00:55:52,786
lf he isn't dead, will he
come searching for us?

560
00:55:55,254 --> 00:55:56,857
Both him and the Police will come.

561
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:57,990
That's for sure!

562
00:56:05,932 --> 00:56:06,900
KISS!

563
00:56:08,902 --> 00:56:09,937
ls he out of his mind?

564
00:56:11,437 --> 00:56:13,608
Let it be. But where is he now?

565
00:56:14,974 --> 00:56:17,380
There's no report of him
checking into any hospital.

566
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:19,780
Still..

567
00:56:20,081 --> 00:56:22,318
can someone be
attacked by kissing?

568
00:56:22,749 --> 00:56:22,749
What C.l. Sir said is true.
There are eye-witnesses!

569
00:56:25,086 --> 00:56:26,823
Where are those eye-witnesses?

570
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:26,921
Notiust that.

571
00:56:27,922 --> 00:56:31,663
Many such cases have been
reported in foreign countries.

572
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:34,529
And that boy?

573
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:36,765
We don't know who he is, Sir.

574
00:56:37,065 --> 00:56:38,367
l'll tell you, Sir.

575
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:38,733
l don't know who that boy is, Sir.

576
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,671
There you go!

577
00:56:42,871 --> 00:56:44,741
What the hell were you doing?

578
00:56:46,408 --> 00:56:46,408
Do you at least have any idea
about the guys who followed you?

579
00:56:49,778 --> 00:56:49,778
No, Sir.

580
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:51,847
You don't know that too?

581
00:56:51,913 --> 00:56:51,913
But if l see them again,
l can recogniM them!

582
00:56:53,782 --> 00:56:55,385
lfyou see, you can recognize!

583
00:56:55,517 --> 00:56:57,923
As ifthey're going to come in
front ofyou evey morning,

584
00:56:57,987 --> 00:57:00,492
and do a fashion parade
saying 'please recogniM us!'

585
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:01,558
Fool!

586
00:57:01,825 --> 00:57:02,793
Moron!

587
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:07,333
We don't even know if
Rambo is dead or alive.

588
00:57:07,397 --> 00:57:08,832
ln case he's alive,

589
00:57:08,932 --> 00:57:10,903
it's sure that he'll come
searching forthat boy.

590
00:57:10,968 --> 00:57:12,771
lf we can track that boy,

591
00:57:12,837 --> 00:57:14,941
we can nab Rambo with
all the evidence!

592
00:57:17,675 --> 00:57:20,647
lt's not that easy
to get rid of Rambo.

593
00:57:21,044 --> 00:57:25,387
Find those 'quotation'
guys and that boy immediately!

594
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,690
Anyway, you go ahead with this.

595
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:33,060
Get some new guys from the
Police training camp as well.

596
00:57:37,763 --> 00:57:40,936
But still, how can someone
attack anyone by kissing?

597
00:57:56,049 --> 00:57:58,153
The urine bladder has been
destroyed by the bullet.

598
00:57:58,385 --> 00:58:00,422
So he cannot control his urine!

599
00:58:00,654 --> 00:58:02,423
lt'll keep on flowing out.

600
00:58:02,589 --> 00:58:04,393
l've attached a urine bag.

601
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:05,926
That means?

602
00:58:06,092 --> 00:58:09,500
Wherever he goes, he'll have to
cary the urine bag with him.

603
00:58:12,533 --> 00:58:13,501
Sheesh!

604
00:58:13,768 --> 00:58:15,805
How can he go around
carying a urine bag?

605
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,040
When will his
condition get better?

606
00:58:18,406 --> 00:58:21,412
A complete cure in this case
is not possible immediately.

607
00:58:22,043 --> 00:58:23,813
Apart from urinating,

608
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:26,550
nothing is else is
possible with this organ!

609
00:58:29,684 --> 00:58:31,554
Don't move or shake rapidly.

610
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,426
Don't strain yourself
under any circumstance!

611
00:58:35,023 --> 00:58:36,394
There will be bleeding!

612
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,529
There are high chances
of it being infected.

613
00:58:38,828 --> 00:58:40,831
Then the only option
would be to chop it o_!

614
00:58:49,873 --> 00:58:53,179
But in this condition, he
cannot travel by flight.

615
00:58:53,444 --> 00:58:53,444
There will be bleeding
if there's air pressure.

616
00:58:55,545 --> 00:58:58,818
And it can't be said how the body
would react during climate change.

617
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:02,520
Sir, Thambi...

618
00:59:12,063 --> 00:59:15,103
He is tired both
mentally and physically!

619
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:18,873
So, ifthere's strain, he
can even lose his mind!

620
00:59:19,705 --> 00:59:22,076
Then he will start doing
really weird things.

621
00:59:22,775 --> 00:59:24,979
Even otherwise, he is
a little eccentric.

622
00:59:26,545 --> 00:59:28,615
Then we have to be vey careful.

623
00:59:31,717 --> 00:59:33,520
(Kisses)

624
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:04,887
l want him!!

625
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,089
Sir, Thambi?

626
01:00:07,856 --> 01:00:08,824
Padayappa?

627
01:00:09,558 --> 01:00:10,526
Then?

628
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:12,896
l want that son of a
b_h who kissed me!

629
01:02:09,886 --> 01:02:11,154
lfyou can't do it, tell me!!

630
01:02:11,253 --> 01:02:11,253
l'll find him!

631
01:02:12,254 --> 01:02:14,660
Bring eveyone you have a doubt on!
Get lost!!

632
01:02:44,756 --> 01:02:45,724
Ganga,

633
01:02:46,124 --> 01:02:47,660
Where were you all this while?

634
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:50,030
l was tying to
jump over a wall.

635
01:02:50,862 --> 01:02:51,830
- Ganga,

636
01:02:52,131 --> 01:02:52,131
Yes, mom!

637
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:54,767
- Take your clothes inside.
Coming!!

638
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:56,870
Mom is calling.
l'll be right back.

639
01:02:56,969 --> 01:02:58,338
Don't leave now, Ganga!

640
01:02:58,437 --> 01:02:59,405
Huh?

641
01:02:59,471 --> 01:03:01,107
l said don't leave!!

642
01:03:03,476 --> 01:03:05,246
You're in form today, huh?

643
01:03:05,512 --> 01:03:06,981
l need a kiss.

644
01:03:08,015 --> 01:03:08,983
(kisses)

645
01:03:09,116 --> 01:03:10,084
Sheesh!

646
01:03:10,483 --> 01:03:11,986
l don't want it overthe phone.

647
01:03:12,152 --> 01:03:13,387
l want it directly!

648
01:03:13,887 --> 01:03:16,157
Okay. You come here.
l'll give you!

649
01:03:16,322 --> 01:03:17,926
l'm already here!

650
01:03:18,325 --> 01:03:19,795
Open the door!

651
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:22,130
What?

652
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:24,399
Open!

653
01:03:26,267 --> 01:03:27,235
Where?

654
01:03:27,736 --> 01:03:27,736
Where are you?

655
01:03:28,737 --> 01:03:30,339
Outside.
- Outside?

656
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:40,717
Where?
- On top of the wall!

657
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:41,183
Top ofthe wall?
Where?

658
01:03:43,185 --> 01:03:45,522
Come to the other side ofthe balcony.
- Where?

659
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,325
First come to the balcony.

660
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:51,394
Saw me now?

661
01:03:53,862 --> 01:03:55,266
Where's my kiss?
- Here?

662
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:56,499
You?

663
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,337
Go!! Somebody will see you!

664
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:02,007
Whateveryou say, l won't
go unless l get a kiss!

665
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:05,776
Gosh!!

666
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,015
- Someone broke it!

667
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:11,883
What's that?

668
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:14,552
Come here!

01:04:18,189 --> 01:04:19,492

No way! Which thiefwould
dare to break into my house!

01:04:27,132 --> 01:04:27,132
Who's that?
Clicking photos?

672
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:30,036
Walk!! Go inside!!

673
01:04:30,235 --> 01:04:31,203
Don't push me!!

675
01:05:04,304 --> 01:05:05,272
Wake up!!

What are you doing here?

677
01:05:09,176 --> 01:05:11,214
Where?
- In my house!

678
01:05:11,279 --> 01:05:11,279
You idiot!! This is my house!

679
01:05:13,248 --> 01:05:14,216
Oh my God!

680
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:17,286
Why am l here?

681
01:05:17,352 --> 01:05:19,389
So you don't remember anything?
- Ganga?

682
01:05:19,588 --> 01:05:20,890
Yes! Coming, mom!

683
01:05:20,955 --> 01:05:22,826

Open the door.
- Shut up 8 come fast!

685
01:05:36,572 --> 01:05:37,942
Dad is there downstairs.

686
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:39,343
How'll you go?

687
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:46,183
You come with me.
Let's see.

688
01:05:46,316 --> 01:05:47,952
What are you going to do?

689
01:05:48,484 --> 01:05:49,587
They will see us!

690
01:05:53,356 --> 01:05:54,992
What's that fo_
- Go down.

691
01:05:57,895 --> 01:05:58,863
Careful!

692
01:06:01,232 --> 01:06:03,002
Oh! How come you're early today?

693
01:06:05,403 --> 01:06:06,438
Come!

694
01:06:22,221 --> 01:06:23,189
Stay here.

695
01:06:28,328 --> 01:06:29,697
What?
- We're trapped!

696
01:06:30,296 --> 01:06:32,433
We can't go back inside.
Mom will come out any minute!

697
01:06:36,336 --> 01:06:37,337
Wait!

698
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:39,975
See! These are our children!

699
01:06:40,607 --> 01:06:42,477
What good is such children!!

700
01:06:51,018 --> 01:06:51,986
Who is it?

701
01:06:52,052 --> 01:06:53,990
l came to give this
book to Ganga, uncle!

702
01:06:54,321 --> 01:06:56,358
ls it?
- Yes, dad!

703
01:06:56,591 --> 01:06:57,559
Then take it!

704
01:07:03,465 --> 01:07:04,433
What's that?

705
01:07:04,632 --> 01:07:05,600
Nothing, dad!

706
01:07:11,106 --> 01:07:13,644
l should be slapped for
giving you this job!

707
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:17,214
They are the only
evidence against Rambo!

708
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,751
You have to find that boy
and those guys immediately!

709
01:07:22,418 --> 01:07:24,388
Did you get any details
about Rambo at least?

710
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:25,087
No, Sir.

711
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:28,494
What the hell were you investigating
for all these days then?

712
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:29,258
Even though l couldn't get
any details on Rambo,

713
01:07:31,395 --> 01:07:34,467
l've got some other details
related to this case.

714
01:07:35,232 --> 01:07:36,200
What details?

715
01:07:36,633 --> 01:07:39,639
There are reports of boys
bemeen the age of 18-22

716
01:07:39,737 --> 01:07:42,576
going missing from various
parts ofthe city, Sir.

717
01:07:42,673 --> 01:07:42,673
So?

718
01:07:43,674 --> 01:07:46,780
There are chances that Rambo
might be behind this.

719
01:07:47,211 --> 01:07:48,180
How?

720
01:07:48,612 --> 01:07:49,614
l don't understand!

721
01:07:50,515 --> 01:07:52,418
Even he wouldn't have
traced that boy.

722
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:55,657
That must be why he's kidnapping
boys ofthat age group,

723
01:07:55,754 --> 01:07:57,289
and tying to identify him!

724
01:07:57,523 --> 01:07:59,760
What did he do to those
boys who were kidnapped?

725
01:08:03,495 --> 01:08:04,630
From what l heard,

726
01:08:04,763 --> 01:08:06,133
he is a psycho!

727
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:11,808
No one can predict what he does,
and how or when he does it!

728
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:04,827
Come forward.

729
01:09:49,274 --> 01:09:50,510
Do you know how to hug?

730
01:09:51,444 --> 01:09:52,412
H.. h.. hug?

731
01:09:52,678 --> 01:09:54,248
Do you know how to hug?

732
01:09:54,346 --> 01:09:55,315
l know!

733
01:10:06,626 --> 01:10:08,128
Do you know how to hug?
- Yes.

734
01:10:08,428 --> 01:10:09,396
l know.

735
01:10:27,648 --> 01:10:28,917
Do you know how to kiss?

736
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,218
Huh?

737
01:10:31,252 --> 01:10:32,688
Do you know how to kiss?

738
01:10:34,723 --> 01:10:35,691
l know!

739
01:11:13,497 --> 01:11:14,967
Stop cying!

740
01:11:28,547 --> 01:11:30,350
lfyou cy, l'll
kill you, you dog!

741
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:12,294
Hug me!!

742
01:12:33,715 --> 01:12:34,684
Slowly.

743
01:12:49,099 --> 01:12:50,067
Not him as well!

744
01:12:57,808 --> 01:13:00,947
One silly kid who's not even
old enough as my career...

745
01:13:01,646 --> 01:13:04,051
lfyou can't even find him,
what's the use of having you all?

746
01:13:13,659 --> 01:13:16,464
l think l know the guy
whom you're searching for!

747
01:13:23,903 --> 01:13:24,871
God!

748
01:13:28,841 --> 01:13:28,841
l mean..

749
01:13:29,842 --> 01:13:31,879
l know someone who kisses vey well!

750
01:13:55,036 --> 01:13:56,739
Dude, l have an idea!
- What?

751
01:13:57,438 --> 01:13:59,709
What ifwe catch
that boy for Rambo?

752
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:00,742
And then?

753
01:14:00,842 --> 01:14:02,712
Rambo will leave us
alone then, right?

754
01:14:02,844 --> 01:14:04,981
He will leave us alone. But
what about that Padayappa?

755
01:14:05,046 --> 01:14:06,482
He will kill us. l'm sure!

756
01:14:08,851 --> 01:14:10,721
l have another idea!
- That's enough!

757
01:14:11,086 --> 01:14:12,789
Let me say it.
What if it's good?

758
01:14:12,855 --> 01:14:13,823
Then say!

759
01:14:15,691 --> 01:14:17,494
What ifwe show Rambo's
Iocation to Padayappa?

760
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,528
And then?

761
01:14:18,594 --> 01:14:20,798
Then they'll settle their
scores themselves, right?

762
01:14:20,863 --> 01:14:21,999
What ifthey don't?

763
01:14:22,198 --> 01:14:24,001
They will settle their score with us!

764
01:14:25,201 --> 01:14:26,603
Shall l say an idea?

765
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,138
Yea. Tell me.

766
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:30,575
Shall we search for that boy?

767
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:30,640
lsn't this what l told you earlier?
- That was earlier, right?

768
01:14:33,043 --> 01:14:35,748
What l'm saying is that we'll
go in different directions.

769
01:14:35,845 --> 01:14:37,516
There's no point in
sticking together.

770
01:14:37,948 --> 01:14:41,890
So as soon as you find him, call me.
l can't walk too much! Sure?

771
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,554
l'll call you.
You should also call me.

772
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,224
Find him, okay?
- Yes.

773
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:47,058
Okay then..

774
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,128
Such torture this is.

775
01:14:50,195 --> 01:14:51,564
Dude, stop!!

776
01:14:51,629 --> 01:14:52,597
Come here!

777
01:14:53,131 --> 01:14:55,001
Any change in plans?
-A small change.

778
01:14:55,067 --> 01:14:56,536
You go this way.
l'll go that way.

779
01:14:56,601 --> 01:14:58,204
Why?
- There's a lot to walk this way.

780
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:00,507
Call me immediately when
you find him, okay?

781
01:15:57,599 --> 01:15:58,767
You iust got lucky!

782
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:03,675
ls this dude the one
l have to kiss?

783
01:16:04,607 --> 01:16:07,813
He would require at least
a double dose of kisses!

784
01:16:21,358 --> 01:16:22,327
Dude!

785
01:16:24,027 --> 01:16:24,995
Hey dude!

786
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:26,598
What happened to you?

787
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:28,166
Mom,

788
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:29,300
What happened to him?

789
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:32,872
He's been sitting there stunned
from the time he came!

790
01:16:32,937 --> 01:16:35,174
You ask him younelf
what happened.

791
01:16:41,313 --> 01:16:43,283
lf you won't tell
anyone, l'll tell you.

792
01:16:43,382 --> 01:16:44,350
Yea. Tell me!

793
01:16:44,983 --> 01:16:49,158
A rich gay man kidnapped me,
threatened me and made me kiss him!

794
01:16:49,922 --> 01:16:51,157
You kissed him?
And then?

795
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,292
He didn't like my kiss!

796
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:54,193
l felt sad for him and
called Komalan for him.

797
01:16:57,197 --> 01:16:59,167
l got this in return for that!

798
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:59,762
What's the important
thing you wanted to say?

799
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,773
Usually, this is supposed
to be a good news.

800
01:19:11,806 --> 01:19:12,774
But..

801
01:19:12,974 --> 01:19:14,444
For us..

802
01:19:14,976 --> 01:19:16,479
this is a bad news!

803
01:19:17,246 --> 01:19:18,348
What's that news?

804
01:20:07,799 --> 01:20:08,767
Give it to me!

805
01:20:08,967 --> 01:20:09,935
What?

806
01:20:10,402 --> 01:20:11,370
Kiss!

807
01:20:13,538 --> 01:20:14,807
Just one kiss!

808
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,568
That day?

809
01:20:42,636 --> 01:20:44,072
Yes! That day!

810
01:20:44,271 --> 01:20:45,907
l slept offtoo soon!

811
01:20:46,106 --> 01:20:47,609
l iust remember one kiss!

812
01:20:47,842 --> 01:20:49,378
With that, you
won't be pregnant!

813
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:53,315
No!

814
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:56,219
l'm really scared!

815
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:57,953
Don't be tensed!

816
01:20:58,186 --> 01:20:59,388
Let me think.

817
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:06,896
Are you thinking of a
name for the child?

818
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:09,833
One tight slap!
Get lost man!

819
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:10,967
What's wrong with him?

820
01:21:11,934 --> 01:21:13,102
How did you confirm this?

821
01:21:15,504 --> 01:21:17,909
l've been vomiting
for the past 2 days.

822
01:21:17,974 --> 01:21:19,309
That must be due
to something else!

823
01:21:20,343 --> 01:21:23,315
Not just that, my belly
is also growing!

824
01:21:23,413 --> 01:21:25,316
You're iust imagining things!

825
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:25,648
No!
It's really growing!

826
01:21:28,118 --> 01:21:29,253
With that you confirmed it?

827
01:21:29,352 --> 01:21:30,620
l checked in Google.

828
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:31,989
This is it!

829
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:33,257
l'm sure!

830
01:21:34,157 --> 01:21:35,627
But that day,
nothing like that..

831
01:21:51,676 --> 01:21:54,080
l shouldn't be walking so fast
in this condition.

832
01:21:57,249 --> 01:21:58,451
My dear Ganga,

833
01:21:58,517 --> 01:22:00,354
stop scaring me saying
this again and again!

834
01:22:00,419 --> 01:22:02,156
Who else should l talk
to about our child?

835
01:22:02,221 --> 01:22:02,221
We'll go to some
hospital 8 check!

836
01:22:03,689 --> 01:22:03,689
There's no need for that.
- Then?

837
01:22:05,525 --> 01:22:07,227
Are you going to give
birth to that baby?

838
01:22:09,562 --> 01:22:11,064
That's why l said so.

839
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:13,101
Let us confirm this fint!

840
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:14,434
And think about the rest later.

841
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,072
Till then, don't
get so worked up!

842
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:19,373
For the time being, don't
tell this to anyone.

843
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:19,439
We'll figure a way out.

844
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:23,078
That kiss that day is the
reason for all this!

845
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:24,545
What do we do now?

846
01:22:25,712 --> 01:22:28,017
This is all this guy does orwhat?

847
01:22:28,148 --> 01:22:29,417
l had warned you then only!

848
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:32,387
You better drop me back home!

849
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:34,589
Why? Can't you take an auto?

850
01:22:35,189 --> 01:22:39,331
lt's said that travelling by auto should
be avoided during the first 3 months!

851
01:22:41,229 --> 01:22:42,998
Looks like you'll end
up having the baby!

852
01:22:43,065 --> 01:22:45,402
Then? What should l do?
- One kick l'll give you!

853
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:47,003
Who tells you all this nonsense?

854
01:22:47,135 --> 01:22:47,135
l downloaded a pregnancy
app on the mobile..

855
01:22:49,271 --> 01:22:50,941
Your bloody app!!
- Gosh! My phone!

856
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,430
Where did he go?

857
01:23:15,065 --> 01:23:16,033
Brother!

858
01:23:18,135 --> 01:23:18,135
Me?
- Can you give me your phone?

859
01:23:19,804 --> 01:23:21,573
To make a call. Please!

860
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:43,597
Don't think that you can
escape leaving me alone.

861
01:23:43,662 --> 01:23:45,365
l didn't do this alone!!

862
01:23:45,631 --> 01:23:47,434
So we will su_ertogether!

863
01:23:47,566 --> 01:23:50,672
Until you tell me that you'll
mary me, l'll stand here!

864
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:54,009
Even if it takes 10
days or even 10 yean!

865
01:23:54,473 --> 01:23:54,473
Then you will be 32,
and l'll be 30!

866
01:23:56,809 --> 01:23:59,013
And ourchild will be 9!
Just rememberthat!

867
01:24:07,688 --> 01:24:08,656
Shall l go?

868
01:24:10,858 --> 01:24:12,160
l got his number!!

869
01:24:19,733 --> 01:24:20,701
Come!

870
01:24:41,657 --> 01:24:43,126
Where's your gun?

871
01:24:43,225 --> 01:24:45,195
No! No! l give up!!

872
01:24:45,695 --> 01:24:47,298
l'll kick you all day,

873
01:24:47,563 --> 01:24:48,598
you bloody dog!!

874
01:24:49,332 --> 01:24:50,300
Hello?
Dude,

875
01:24:50,366 --> 01:24:52,536
l got that Emraan Hashmi's number!

876
01:24:53,302 --> 01:24:54,271
Police?

877
01:24:54,537 --> 01:24:55,505
Which police?

878
01:24:58,508 --> 01:25:00,278
Sir, he cut the call.

879
01:25:00,877 --> 01:25:02,447
l think he must have escaped!

880
01:25:02,546 --> 01:25:04,716
Now we'll have to make
this one speak the truth!

881
01:25:05,315 --> 01:25:06,284
Stand up!

882
01:25:09,386 --> 01:25:11,256
Sir, please don't
do anything to him.

883
01:25:12,322 --> 01:25:12,322
Then you come here directly.

884
01:25:14,225 --> 01:25:16,330
We'll talk about the
rest once you are here.

885
01:25:16,394 --> 01:25:17,696
What's the case, Sir?

886
01:25:18,763 --> 01:25:21,368
You'll come here only if
you know what's the case?

887
01:25:21,499 --> 01:25:23,769
Sir, you please give the
phone to Padmanabhan Sir.

888
01:25:23,902 --> 01:25:24,870
Leave me!

889
01:25:25,303 --> 01:25:25,303

Won't even allow me to

914
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:54,667
Don't spoil your body by
getting punched so much!

915
01:26:54,765 --> 01:26:55,766
Don't tickle me!

916

What do you want?

01:28:03,371 --> 01:28:03,371
Can you give me some water?

You're asking for water a_er breaking

Yea right! Your tummy won't

You won't give me?

954
01:29:13,112 --> 01:29:17,754
Hey! Who's this guy to tell me that
he won't give me any more drinks?

955
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,455
Do you know Padayappa?

956
01:29:21,922 --> 01:29:23,859
Do you know C.l. Padayappa?

957
01:29:24,791 --> 01:29:26,127
His name is Padayappa.

958
01:29:26,193 --> 01:29:27,729
l'm his father-in-law.

959
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:29,498
He is my son-in-law!!

960
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:35,704
l'll put all of you behind bars!

961
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:38,374
l'll make him raid this bar!

962
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:43,180
You've kept a beer parlour
board and serving liquor here?

963
01:29:43,645 --> 01:29:43,645
Peg! Peg!

964
01:29:44,646 --> 01:29:45,614
Padayappa Sir,

965
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:48,185
l let your son free.
He's a small child.

966
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:50,854
But l'm going to kidnap
your father-in-law!

967
01:29:51,954 --> 01:29:53,489
Nowthetime is 12 PM.

968
01:29:53,723 --> 01:29:56,995
At 1 PM, you should drop Kumaari
at a place which l decide.

969
01:29:58,627 --> 01:30:00,063
And within 2 PM,

970
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:03,169
your father-in-law will
be back home, alive.

971
01:30:03,866 --> 01:30:08,175
Or else.. You don't know me! l'll
finish him o_, l'm telling you!

972
01:30:13,043 --> 01:30:15,948
Brother, give one half
bottle to this uncle!

973
01:30:19,816 --> 01:30:22,054
l don't like anyone staying
without drinking in this bar!

974
01:30:22,152 --> 01:30:22,152
lf l had one more daughter, l'd
have gotten her married to you!

975
01:30:25,089 --> 01:30:26,759
Will that be possible in this age?

976
01:30:26,824 --> 01:30:28,727
Will you wait? l'll ty!!

977
01:30:28,793 --> 01:30:30,863
Give it to him!
- Bring it on!

978
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:35,468
There's much more kick in
getting hit by a beer bottle,

979
01:30:35,533 --> 01:30:36,735
than drinking beer!

980
01:30:36,969 --> 01:30:38,772
l'm still in that hangover!

981
01:30:39,571 --> 01:30:41,541
Stop smoking and tell
me a way out ofthis!

982
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,676
l'll tell you..

983
01:30:43,842 --> 01:30:45,779
But you should tell me the truth.
- What?

984
01:30:46,712 --> 01:30:48,449
Did something happen that day?
- Huh?

985
01:30:49,215 --> 01:30:50,183
You b.__

986
01:30:50,549 --> 01:30:53,454
Did some action happen that day?

987
01:30:54,788 --> 01:30:56,223
l don't remember!

988
01:30:56,489 --> 01:30:57,758
l was really drunk!

989
01:30:57,957 --> 01:30:59,593
All l remember is
giving her a kiss!

990
01:30:59,726 --> 01:31:00,661
Yea right!

991
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:04,066
Just because you gave her a
kiss, this won't happen!

992
01:31:04,164 --> 01:31:05,966
Leave that..
- Get lost you fool!

993
01:31:06,066 --> 01:31:08,236
l should be blamed
for asking you to help!

994
01:31:08,936 --> 01:31:10,906
Bro, one small help!

995
01:31:12,106 --> 01:31:14,043
l broke into her house, dude!

996
01:31:15,109 --> 01:31:16,077
Ya!

997
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:19,481
Much more than that!!

998
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:24,053
Much much more than that!

999
01:31:25,987 --> 01:31:27,623
That's what she's saying!

1000
01:31:27,756 --> 01:31:29,726
Please tell me a way out, bro!

1001
01:31:29,825 --> 01:31:32,864
Bro, iust ask her to have an i-pill.

1002
01:31:33,061 --> 01:31:34,798
That time is over!

1003
01:31:35,197 --> 01:31:36,299
Any other option?

1004
01:31:36,532 --> 01:31:36,532
l think, Papaya is best for that.
- l've heard palm jaggey is good!

1005
01:31:39,635 --> 01:31:41,071
How did you do it, bro?

1006
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:43,207
Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me in detail!

1007
01:31:43,272 --> 01:31:44,541
You didn't use protection?

1008
01:31:45,908 --> 01:31:47,911
Bro, l'm telling you
from my own experience..

1009
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:49,613
Viagra is the best solution!

1010
01:31:49,912 --> 01:31:51,114
Shut up you b__!!_

1011
01:31:52,948 --> 01:31:53,951

Bro!
- Get lost!

1014

Fint you buy a pregnancy kit
and confirm if it's true!

1016
01:32:02,926 --> 01:32:05,631
A_er that you can announce

1017
01:32:05,696 --> 01:32:06,664
Bro!!

1018
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:10,668

Shall l order one more drink?

01:32:35,194 --> 01:32:36,162
We've reached!

1021
01:32:36,662 --> 01:32:38,899
Drop him here and leave!

1022
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:42,104
Within one hour, your
father-in-law will be back home!

1023
01:32:43,203 --> 01:32:44,973
Give the phone to Kumaari.

1024
01:32:50,009 --> 01:32:52,582
Bro, l'm at our usual bar.

A_er Padayappa leaves. Okay?

The pickle is good!

1028
01:33:19,407 --> 01:33:22,212
Not Padayappa. You are my real son-in-law!

1029
01:33:29,418 --> 01:33:31,255
That is Padayappa's father-in-law.

1030
01:33:31,353 --> 01:33:33,224
He doesn't know that
we've kidnapped him.

1031
01:33:33,389 --> 01:33:36,094
l've got a car outside. We
have to leave immediately!

1032
01:33:36,358 --> 01:33:39,265
Jai! Veeru!
Come with me!

1033
01:33:43,968 --> 01:33:45,403
Don't turn around.
Someone's coming!

1034
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:56,784
You thought you could escape
a_er breaking both my arms?

1035
01:33:56,947 --> 01:33:58,417
Jai! Veeru!!

Arrey O Samba!!

Sanjeev Kumar has fallen down!
Let's go!

1039
01:34:48,837 --> 01:34:50,172
You don't look like
you're so heavy!

1040
01:34:50,238 --> 01:34:50,238
Run along with me, children!
- Shut up!

1041
01:34:52,306 --> 01:34:54,076
You are to blame for all this!

1042
01:34:54,342 --> 01:34:57,014
Get him into the car!!

1043
01:34:57,846 --> 01:34:57,846
We'll go to the next bar!

1044
01:34:59,414 --> 01:35:00,949
This place isn't good!

1045
01:35:02,284 --> 01:35:03,519
Get in fast!!

1046
01:35:04,854 --> 01:35:06,289
Let's go!!

1047
01:35:07,322 --> 01:35:08,290
Start the car!

1048
01:35:09,191 --> 01:35:10,794
Oh my God!
That's him!

1049
01:35:12,127 --> 01:35:13,263
Gosh! South India!

1050
01:35:13,363 --> 01:35:13,363
You didn't take the key?

1051
01:35:15,030 --> 01:35:17,201
Along with the key, get the
rest of the alcohol as well!

1052
01:35:17,267 --> 01:35:18,235
What is it?

1053
01:35:18,568 --> 01:35:19,536
Don't run!

1054
01:35:21,404 --> 01:35:22,907
Where are you o_ to?

1055
01:35:26,175 --> 01:35:27,144

Let's go!
Get in!

1057
01:35:30,547 --> 01:35:31,515
Where?

1058
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:36,388
We are on the road behind the bar.

1059
01:35:41,559 --> 01:35:43,796
There's a big ruckus in the bar.
But l got away!

1060
01:35:47,332 --> 01:35:47,332
The police are getting
complaints that,

1061
01:35:49,301 --> 01:35:49,301
boys from the city are being
kidnapped and molested.

1062
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:55,777
ln the past 2 weeks, more than
a 100 complaints were reported!

1063
01:35:55,874 --> 01:35:59,548
The prime suspect is a major
underworld don from the city.

1064
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:13,093
You have a courier.

1065
01:36:41,255 --> 01:36:42,959
lt's me, Thambi!

1066
01:36:43,458 --> 01:36:46,865
l've been wanting to send a
gi_ to you for a long time!

1067
01:36:47,463 --> 01:36:47,463
Only now l could find
something that suits you,

1068
01:36:50,199 --> 01:36:53,271
and something that you
need the most right now!

1069
01:36:54,269 --> 01:36:56,073
Best quality diaper!

1070
01:37:04,447 --> 01:37:05,415
lt's good!

1071
01:37:06,983 --> 01:37:07,952
l like it.

1072
01:37:09,486 --> 01:37:09,486
To show you my gratitude,

1073
01:37:11,254 --> 01:37:13,157
l will be coming to meet you!

1074
01:37:14,992 --> 01:37:16,862
Let the beginning of
Rambo's comeback,

1075
01:37:17,995 --> 01:37:19,898
start from another Thambi again!

1076
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,375
Let's begin!

1077
01:37:33,311 --> 01:37:35,683
They kidnapped me fint!

1078
01:37:36,148 --> 01:37:38,685
And you did that a_er them!
What say?

1079
01:37:39,151 --> 01:37:39,151
Aren't you having your tea, brother?

1080
01:37:40,618 --> 01:37:42,489
No, brother! It'll be a bad mix!

1081
01:37:43,088 --> 01:37:44,490
Bro, what happened to your nose?

1082
01:37:45,457 --> 01:37:47,160
You wanna know what
happened to my nose?

1083
01:37:48,928 --> 01:37:51,400
lfyou can't say, it's fine!
- Come! l'll tell you.

1084
01:37:53,366 --> 01:37:55,269
One minute! Please hold this!

1085
01:37:55,334 --> 01:37:55,334
Hold this, brother!
Don't drink it!

1086
01:37:56,702 --> 01:37:57,670
Come here!

1087
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:04,411
Now you know what happened?

1088
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:07,182
What's your name?

1089
01:38:07,581 --> 01:38:08,983
Ku..
- Huh?

1090
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:10,718
Are you abusing me?

1091
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:16,726
l was saying my name. Kumaari.
- Oh! Kumaari!

1092
01:38:17,157 --> 01:38:18,426
Nice name!

1093
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:20,228
J
So Kumaari

1094
01:38:21,496 --> 01:38:25,002
do you know who's the biggest
car burglar in South India?

1095
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:25,100
No, Sir! l don't know
anyone in Bombay.

1096
01:38:27,235 --> 01:38:28,737
Oh! Bombay is in South India?

1097
01:38:29,004 --> 01:38:30,172
Are you mocking me?

1098
01:38:34,076 --> 01:38:35,044
lt's me! Disney!

1099
01:38:36,011 --> 01:38:38,716
And what should l do to
someone who steals MY ca_

1100
01:38:39,315 --> 01:38:40,417
l don't know, Sir.

1101
01:38:40,716 --> 01:38:41,684
You don't?

1102
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,553
l know you don't know that.

1103
01:38:44,053 --> 01:38:46,590
But you know where the guy
who stole the car is!

1104
01:38:46,756 --> 01:38:48,559
Tell me!
- l don't know, Sir.

1105
01:38:49,058 --> 01:38:50,193
You will tell me!!

1106
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,430
Or l'll make you tell me!

1107
01:38:53,195 --> 01:38:54,232
Don't tell him..

1108
01:38:54,598 --> 01:38:55,733
Don't cheat him!

1109
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:56,100
He bought me drinks!

1110
01:38:57,767 --> 01:38:59,570
You get lost. He isn't
your son-in-law, right?

1111
01:38:59,636 --> 01:39:00,972
l can't get beaten anymore!

1112
01:39:01,105 --> 01:39:04,077
lf it was my son-in-law, l'd
have shown where he was hiding!

1113
01:39:04,174 --> 01:39:05,142
Tell me!

1114
01:39:08,078 --> 01:39:09,046
Dial it!

1115
01:39:18,256 --> 01:39:18,256
He cut the call.

1116
01:39:19,357 --> 01:39:21,127
Oh! He cut the call again?

1117
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,768
Dial again!

1118
01:39:30,336 --> 01:39:32,708
Keep dialling until he picks up.
Keep hitting him until then!

1119
01:42:00,462 --> 01:42:01,430
Disney,

1120
01:42:02,798 --> 01:42:03,766
Padayappa,

1121
01:42:04,899 --> 01:42:06,904
Kumaari, Putthari..

1122
01:42:07,636 --> 01:42:08,839
l need all ofthem!

1123
01:42:10,472 --> 01:42:11,942
But before all ofthem,

1124
01:42:12,809 --> 01:42:14,378
l need that boy!

1125
01:43:18,011 --> 01:43:20,883
Wherever l go in Kerala, this
South India guy is there!

1126
01:43:23,884 --> 01:43:26,522
Why did you hit him on his nose?
Even my nose is gone now!

1127
01:43:39,567 --> 01:43:41,304
The deal will happen
once Rambo comes.

1128
01:43:43,405 --> 01:43:44,607
Ya! Let him also come!

1129
01:43:44,773 --> 01:43:48,680
Gold biscuits, smuggling,
pimping, murder, drugs..

1130
01:43:48,744 --> 01:43:51,716
An underworld has so many
such nice jobs to do!

1131
01:43:51,814 --> 01:43:55,521
But he's le_ all that and
Iooking for a god-damn kiss!

1132
01:43:55,751 --> 01:43:58,056
l'm fed up ofthis life! Can
someone drop me back home?

1133
01:44:00,089 --> 01:44:01,692
Oh! He's here!

1134
01:44:53,913 --> 01:44:55,081
Send Putthari here.

1135
01:44:55,415 --> 01:44:55,415
And you can take your
father-in-law with you!

1136
01:44:57,484 --> 01:44:58,452
l'm not going!

1137
01:44:59,152 --> 01:45:00,454
You aren't going?
- No!

1138
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:05,596
lt's better to join your gang rather
than staying with him in his house!

1139
01:45:05,859 --> 01:45:07,696
At least you have
your own bar, right?

1140
01:45:07,794 --> 01:45:09,465
He won't even give me
a drop of alcohol!

1141
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:11,567
l won't consider that you're my
father-in-law! l'll kick you!

1142
01:45:11,699 --> 01:45:13,069
Kick me! Come on!

1143
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,171
Kill me!!
- Stop it!

1144
01:45:15,602 --> 01:45:18,175
lfyou shout again, l'll throw
both ofyou into the sea!

1145
01:45:18,439 --> 01:45:19,474
Bloody nuisance!

1146
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:22,645
Before all that,

1147
01:45:23,512 --> 01:45:24,747
bring me his phone.

1148
01:45:29,018 --> 01:45:31,155
Son-in-law it seems!

1149
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,190
Bloody ba_$$d!

1150
01:45:33,822 --> 01:45:36,595
He won't even give me a drop!

1151
01:45:36,992 --> 01:45:37,960
Padayappa!

1152
01:45:46,835 --> 01:45:49,174
There's a name saved in it as 'Kiss'.

1153
01:45:49,239 --> 01:45:51,543
That's his number!

1154
01:46:03,554 --> 01:46:04,924
Don't look at me, Sir.

1155
01:46:05,089 --> 01:46:07,961
You yourselffinished all the balance
saying deal and no deal, right?

1156
01:46:08,459 --> 01:46:10,664
Just recharge it for
me before we all die.

1157
01:46:10,728 --> 01:46:12,665
lfyou give Rs.100, l'll
go get it recharged now.

1158
01:46:12,730 --> 01:46:13,698
Hey! Shut up!

1159
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:36,527
'l've been waiting foryou,
for many lifetimes.#

1160
01:46:41,861 --> 01:46:47,505
'Such is my love for
you, my dear.#

1161
01:46:51,105 --> 01:46:53,142
His dialer tone is brilliant!

1162
01:46:53,874 --> 01:46:57,681
'The endless shores, and the
silent stars are witnesses#

1163
01:46:57,745 --> 01:46:57,745
What song is this?

1164
01:46:58,979 --> 01:47:00,816
lt's coming from that phone.

1165
01:47:07,522 --> 01:47:09,525
Sheesh! Even he cut the call!

1166
01:47:10,759 --> 01:47:13,130
Call again! Keep calling
until he picks up!

1167
01:47:26,976 --> 01:47:28,813
He's the one who kissed him!

1168
01:47:47,831 --> 01:47:50,102
Which bloody ba__d
is going on calling! Nuisance!

1169
01:47:51,235 --> 01:47:53,205
Hey.. He's asking you to stop!

1170
01:47:58,610 --> 01:48:00,347
Ty to understand what l'm saying!

1171
01:48:00,612 --> 01:48:02,782
You understand my
situation first, Bharath!

1172
01:48:02,847 --> 01:48:04,817
That's why l'm
suggesting this, right?

1173
01:48:04,883 --> 01:48:06,786
But l can't do this!
- Why?

1174
01:48:06,851 --> 01:48:07,819
l'm scared!

1175
01:48:07,887 --> 01:48:09,824
So are you going to give
birth to this child?

1176
01:48:19,031 --> 01:48:20,667
That's what l'm saying..

1177
01:48:21,034 --> 01:48:23,004
Just go to the toilet
and checkthis.

1178
01:48:23,669 --> 01:48:24,838
What's that thing?

1179
01:48:26,039 --> 01:48:28,042
lt'sjust a case of a
single drop of urine!

1180
01:48:30,677 --> 01:48:33,716
lf it's positive, there'll be 2 lines.
And one line if it's negative.

1181
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:33,780
We don't have to be tensed
if it's negative, right?

1182
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:38,120
lt will be positive. l'm sure!

1183
01:48:38,619 --> 01:48:39,888
Don't be so negative!

1184
01:48:40,054 --> 01:48:41,957
lt's your result which
should be negative.

1185
01:48:43,224 --> 01:48:44,827
Just one drop of urine.

1186
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:48,164
But l don't think l can go now.

1187
01:48:48,262 --> 01:48:49,365
Why can't you?

1188
01:48:49,431 --> 01:48:51,635
l don't think it'll come now.
That's all!

1189
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:57,607
They don't have a drop
when they need it,

1190
01:48:58,173 --> 01:49:00,878
and that guy's urine
never stops flowing!

1191
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:02,946
God's games can be strange!

1192
01:49:10,954 --> 01:49:10,954
Look at that!

1193
01:49:11,955 --> 01:49:15,094
He must be the first hero to smile
at the villain in the climax!

1194
01:49:15,224 --> 01:49:16,426
Maybe the last too!

1195
01:49:20,029 --> 01:49:22,066
Did you see that guy?
- Which guy?

1196
01:49:23,467 --> 01:49:25,404
Don't look so quickly.
Slowly!

1197
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:29,409
Don't look quickly. Just
glance slowly once l tell you.

1198
01:49:30,975 --> 01:49:33,145
Did you see the guy sitting
on your right side?

1199
01:49:33,744 --> 01:49:36,249
With long hair... And a blue shirt.

1200
01:49:47,425 --> 01:49:49,195
Saw him?
- Yes!

1201
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:49,260
Why?

1202
01:49:50,261 --> 01:49:52,299
l don't know if you'd believe it.
- What?

1203
01:49:52,397 --> 01:49:55,370
He was there next to me
when you said you loved me.

1204
01:49:55,834 --> 01:49:56,802
So what?

1205
01:49:57,036 --> 01:49:58,004
So what?

1206
01:49:58,103 --> 01:49:58,103
He was next to me during one of
the turning points in my life!

1207
01:50:01,207 --> 01:50:01,207
And today as well!

1208
01:50:02,407 --> 01:50:04,846
l'm sure. This result will be negative!

1209
01:50:05,011 --> 01:50:06,146
Just wait 8 watch!

1210
01:50:13,753 --> 01:50:13,753
He'll be the fint fool to
call his killer a lucky angel!

1211
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:18,058
The last too!

1212
01:50:18,124 --> 01:50:18,124
lfthe result is negative,

1213
01:50:19,493 --> 01:50:21,363
l will give another kiss for sure!

1214
01:50:21,729 --> 01:50:22,697
To me?

1215
01:50:22,763 --> 01:50:24,399
Not you!! l'll kiss him!

1216
01:50:27,335 --> 01:50:28,403
You don't wory!

1217
01:50:28,502 --> 01:50:30,138
Let's see what happens.

1218
01:50:30,839 --> 01:50:31,807
Go!

1219
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:34,009
Go, l say!

1220
01:51:35,473 --> 01:51:36,541
Checked it?
- Yes!

1221
01:51:36,609 --> 01:51:37,577
And?

1222
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:42,448
Tell it out!!

1223
01:51:47,086 --> 01:51:48,054
By the way...

1224
01:51:50,623 --> 01:51:52,894
l understood one thing!

1225
01:51:54,226 --> 01:51:55,897
With iust a kiss,

1226
01:51:57,196 --> 01:51:59,167
one can't get pregnant!

1227
01:52:25,393 --> 01:52:26,929
What is this? Huh?

1228
01:55:16,498 --> 01:55:16,498
You have to stop this
kissing business now!

1229
01:55:18,066 --> 01:55:20,216
l can't keep going to a police
station in this age, Bharath!

1230
01:55:21,462 --> 01:55:22,304
Ok, mom!

1231
01:55:22,798 --> 01:55:25,181
lsn't this what you always say?
l don't believe you!

1232
01:55:25,323 --> 01:55:25,323
Come! Swear on your father!

1233
01:55:26,891 --> 01:55:28,605
That you will never kiss strangers!

1234
01:55:29,097 --> 01:55:31,887

1235
01:55:43,293 --> 01:55:44,543
Sit down!
- Greetings, Sir.

1236
01:55:47,126 --> 01:55:49,595
This is a proud moment for
the police department!

1237
01:55:50,204 --> 01:55:52,179
To be frank, my heart rate
came back to normal only now!

01:55:52,293 --> 01:55:54,299
Anyway, all ofyou will be promoted!

Here, Sir.

1241
01:56:02,048 --> 01:56:05,912
Sir, we've caught only Disney and gang.
We haven't found Rambo's body yet!

1242
01:56:06,141 --> 01:56:08,872
What about the search operation in the sea?
Coast guard stopped searching, Sir!

1243
01:56:17,318 --> 01:56:18,974
God! They stopped searching?

1244
01:56:19,321 --> 01:56:21,646
l have asked you many
times not to call me!

1245
01:56:21,759 --> 01:56:25,479
This Putthari started by robbing a car
from the No.1 car robber in South India!

1246
01:56:26,056 --> 01:56:27,624
So none ofthis is new to me!

1247

1248
01:56:29,946 --> 01:56:30,788

01:56:30,846 --> 01:56:31,688

1250
01:56:32,269 --> 01:56:32,269
Which 10 lakhs?

1251
01:56:34,127 --> 01:56:35,085
This is my car!

1252
01:56:38,249 --> 01:56:40,080
That Sir is gone! Now l own this car!

1253
01:56:40,165 --> 01:56:42,198
You can't touch it
without paying 20 lakhs!

1254
01:56:45,769 --> 01:56:46,989
Rs. 20 lakhs!

1255
01:56:47,191 --> 01:56:48,033
What is this?

1256
01:56:48,932 --> 01:56:52,187

of it and burn it up! You don't know me!

1257

Tell him about me!

1258
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:44,933
Just two kisses,

1259
01:57:46,385 --> 01:57:48,099
turned the lives of
many people around.

1260
01:57:48,475 --> 01:57:52,602
But still, Rambo kept bothering
them as a nightmare!

1261
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:53,642
Like this..

1262
01:58:04,384 --> 01:58:06,678
