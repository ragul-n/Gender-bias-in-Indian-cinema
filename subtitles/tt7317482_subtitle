1
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,090
Every life has a purpose.

2
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,000
Life is all about understanding this purpose.

3
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,470
Krishna, who was born to Devaki, 
grew up under Yashoda's care..

4
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,000
Mischievous boy Krishna became 
the wrestler Krishna and defeated Kamsa..

5
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,860
He preached the holy Bhagavadgeetha 
to the world...

6
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,800
Thus fulfilled his purpose of life

7
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,500
Just like that Pailwaan Krishna...

8
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,750
Here too a baby Krishna has taken birth...

9
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,250
What's the purpose of this Krishna?

10
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,350
This is the land of men, Gajendragar!

11
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,940
Every grain of sand is alive with bravery 
and courage!

12
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,980
This is Sarkar, senior wrestler...

13
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,480
A Bachelor...

14
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,770
Although he quit along ago, 
he still has the wrestling bug

15
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,420
He wishes to identify and nurture the local talent..

16
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,920
.. hence he has dedicated his life to wrestling.

17
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,750
One day in his life...

18
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,480
Three guys ganging up on a kid?

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,600
The kid himself set a bet to fight them!

20
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,020
Sarkar, that boy-

21
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,770
Ah, my leg!

22
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,650
What a fight! What a fighter!

23
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,730
How did you know the boy would win?

24
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,690
He has no fear in his eyes...

25
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,600
- Hand it over... 
- Here you go

26
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,520
May good attend you! Bye!

27
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,480
Wrestler eh?

28
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,980
Are you in pain?

29
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,850
No pain greater than hunger sir.

30
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,150
Where are you from? 
Where are your parents?

31
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,440
I have no one...I'm an orphan

32
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,060
With another human by the side, 
none can be an orphan.

33
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,060
Will you come with me?

34
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,810
Is it right to bring home this street rat?

35
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,650
Have you ever fought for a single meal?

36
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,690
That guy struggles...

37
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,730
Not for himself, but for others...

38
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,310
What guarantee that he won't 
become a rowdy tomorrow?

39
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,020
He who abuses might will become a rowdy.

40
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,690
He who has a mighty 
reason will be a warrior.

41
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,850
He is a warrior.

42
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,230
Hey, who is it?!

43
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,100
What happened?

44
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,980
He's running way, Sarkar!

45
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,940
Did anyone scold him?

46
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,650
No one said anything, Sarkar.

47
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,560
I have never seen so much love.

48
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,520
I have only been abused.

49
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,900
After I get used to all this love, 
what if you send me away?

50
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,770
Hey!

51
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,190
You are not just like my son, 
you are my son!

52
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,520
Understand?

53
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,020
You will never be sent out of this house.

54
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,150
Look...my temple! This gymnasium...

55
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,150
Ever since I was a boy, 
I have been wrestling here.

56
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,270
My father, forefathers... 
all practiced here.

57
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,020
I have a dream... 
will you fulfill it?

58
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,190
Anything except studies!

59
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,440
Will you become the 
National Wrestling Champion?

60
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,850
Sarkar, my life is yours! As you say...

61
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,850
This is the moment

62
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,100
The finale of the Fair and Handsome 
Pro Boxing League!

63
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,810
Here's the crowd favorite...

64
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,480
King Tony!

65
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,600
Come on charge!

66
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,150
That was brilliant from Navdeep!

67
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,150
No one has challenged Tony like this before!

68
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,350
Hey, cheating!

69
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,150
Oh brother!

70
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,100
Tony, you are making a mistake!

71
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,190
Don't cross the limits!

72
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,150
Hey old man, winning is 
the only thing for me.

73
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,480
The next round begins...

74
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,310
Navdeep tries for a knockout.

75
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,810
But Tony counters!

76
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,310
- Dad... 
- Hey!

77
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,560
Hey, don't do that Tony!

78
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,980
That's fatal!

79
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,690
Navdeep is seriously injured.

80
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,190
The doctor has been called for!

81
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,230
Knockout specialist Tony's ban 
episode has a new twist!

82
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,100
Tony's own coach Vijayendra 
has stood witness against him!

83
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:31,150
Tony may be banned for five years. 
His career may be over!

84
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:42,480
Hey old man! 
I have fed you and clothed you!

85
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,150
You dare complain and get me banned?

86
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,150
Tony!

87
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,480
Forgotten so soon? 
Who rescued you from the streets?

88
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,060
Who trained and made you champ?

89
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,400
Get lost!

90
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,270
Did all your trainees become champs?

91
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,100
I have talent and guts!

92
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,350
That's why I'm a champion!

93
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,190
There is no boxer like me in all India!

94
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,770
Get it?

95
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,810
I'll create a new champion...

96
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,440
At least to avenge this insult!

97
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:35,520
If you really have the guts, 
find just one guy!

98
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,060
Tony is the best!

99
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,690
I'll be waiting!

100
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,560
Bring a real man to fight me!

101
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,150
Don't be sad, Appa.

102
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,690
Tony was my student. 
I gave him too much affection.

103
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,350
Don't worry about it.

104
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,850
You will surely find another like him!

105
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,850
It's not so easy dear.

106
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,150
Tony is a diamond I have shaped 
with great difficulty.

107
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,150
Only diamond can cut diamond.

108
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,940
Did you fall brother?

109
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,310
I was bowing to mother Earth!

110
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,560
- Don't make fun of this, Paapu. 
- What'd you say?

111
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,480
You donkey! I'm Assault Paapanna!

112
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,770
Assaulted every wrestler from 
Kashmir to Kanyakumari!

113
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,810
- I know all about you. 
- What do you know?

114
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,600
You haven't fought a single wrestler.

115
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,480
They say you've been 
assaulted by all and sundry.

116
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,150
That's why you are Assault Paapanna!

117
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,480
Shut your mouth! 
Here's twenty rupees, have some tea!

118
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,770
Stripping away the little dignity I have...

119
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,850
Excuse me

120
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,190
Just a minute sir!

121
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,310
Have some tea and continue practice.

122
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,440
- I'm Vijayendra, boxing coach. 
- Hello!

123
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,520
I heard you're disposing of 
your champ's equipment.

124
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,650
Yes sir...-Okay

125
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,940
This it sir...

126
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,480
Wow, old-style equipment!

127
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,650
- Can I see these? 
- Please sir!

128
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,650
Thank you

129
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,520
If my boys use it, 
their bodies will be like stone!

130
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,650
Can I buy this?

131
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,190
It's priceless, sir.

132
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,650
- Oh...that special eh? 
- Yes sir, very special-

133
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:52,100
These were used by a champion 
who was undefeated for seven years!

134
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,400
Every piece bears his stamp!

135
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:07,060
Had you come four years ago, 
you could have met our champ Kichcha!

136
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,230
Kichcha was a lion in the ring!

137
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,650
Welcome every one to Gajendragar, 
the land of men!

138
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,980
In today's most-awaited wrestling match...

139
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,230
...the North Indian champ, Baljit Singh!

140
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,440
Facing this Haryanvi Sardar today, 
the great warrior, our tiger...

141
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,980
Hey shut up!

142
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:45,900
Our very own knight 
from Veeranjaneya Gym...Kichcha!

143
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,690
Kichcha!

144
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,650
Kichcha!

145
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,810
This is a fifteen-point match...

146
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,770
The players are ready to begin!

147
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,350
The first hold by Kichcha!

148
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,520
A match of equals, but Kichcha....

149
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,270
...gains the upper hand!

150
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,480
Hey Sarkar, how much have you paid him 
to throw the match?!

151
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,020
Talking ill of Sarkar...

152
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,150
Is he some big shot? 
The eunuch can't even father a child!

153
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,150
And we have to fear him???

154
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:00,060
If he is man enough, ask him to face me. 
I'll show him!

155
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,980
Sarkar...

156
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,770
Let it go...

157
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:09,900
This is a 15-point match! 
Let's see who wins.

158
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,190
He will score at least 
one point...you'll see.

159
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,440
The player knows the game, 
the viewer knows zilch!

160
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:25,190
Five points required... 
Baljit makes a strong comeback.

161
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,150
In a counter-move, Kichcha throws him!

162
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,400
Kichcha wins five points.

163
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,060
Well done!

164
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,440
Like every year, this year also...

165
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,650
...the winner of this match is Kichcha!

166
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:52,440
He wins the title of Veera Kesari, 
the brave lion!

167
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,400
He wins every match

168
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,230
No one can face the Pailwaan

169
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,230
Born of the soil

170
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,020
To face the typhoon

171
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,310
This leader of men

172
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,690
Don't you dare meet his eye

173
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,520
He sees through the window of your heart

174
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,400
Immoveable, unyielding

175
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
The Emperor of our land

176
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,730
His mustache has never been muddied

177
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,190
Come on Pailwaan

178
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,600
He wins every match

179
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
No one can face the Pailwaan

180
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,400
Born of the soil

181
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
To face the typhoon

182
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,770
Hey champion of the world

183
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,150
He has no fear

184
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,940
Rayanna Sindhoora Lakshmana

185
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,850
Born of the same soil as him

186
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,900
See this wonder

187
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,650
The symbol of courage

188
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,980
Our Pailwaan

189
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,350
Anjaneyaaya Vidmahe

190
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,350
Vaayuputraya Dheemahi

191
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,350
Tanno Hanuma Prachodayaat

192
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,350
Jai Jai Jai Hanumaaan

193
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,940
Every limb like lightning shines

194
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,020
Colors of every hue painted

195
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,900
Like the spice of Mandakki Mirchi

196
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,730
Excitement shines in the eye

197
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,850
Cherished by Hanuman himself

198
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,400
Let us sing his praise

199
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,520
Come on Pailwaan

200
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,100
Come on Pailwaan

201
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,910
Going where?

202
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,500
- Why did you drag me into this? 
- Did you hear me?

203
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
To the temple...

204
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,750
Temple?

205
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,870
I had made a vow that if I won...

206
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,950
You made a vow?!

207
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,620
- Not me...him 
- Yes, yes on his behalf!

208
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,660
What have you gotten me into...

209
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:41,660
You are going for the Nationals... 
don't get into fights, police and all that.

210
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,000
Sarkar! What are you saying?

211
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,700
Fighter in the ring, friend outside!

212
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,450
The very image of peace!

213
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,750
- Let's go... 
- Which temple?

214
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,410
Now we are finished...

215
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,410
- the one in the northern side... 
- south!

216
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,660
First north 
and then south...

217
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,660
Ever seen a goddess before?

218
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,870
What a question!

219
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,200
What a face!

220
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,080
And that light in her face!

221
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,790
Those features!

222
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,700
Indescribable! 
That's how wonderful she is...

223
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,330
Let's make an escape...

224
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,910
That's what I am trying to do...

225
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,080
- Overall... 
- Get going

226
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,950
Thank God, let's go!

227
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,120
- That way? 
- Yes, that way...

228
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,000
Hey! Idiot, can't you see 
where you are going?

229
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,120
Hey, those scoundrels are coming this way.

230
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,000
Whenever injustice on 
earth becomes intolerable...

231
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,080
...when evil flourishes...

232
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,290
...He will to come end it...

233
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,000
Are you joking?

234
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,410
Nothing will happen, relax. 
Bow to the idol...

235
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,750
Hey! Do you know who 
you're laying your hands on?

236
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,120
Sorry sir...

237
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,410
Did you say something to Sarkar?

238
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,290
What did I say?

239
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,200
Just try to remember...

240
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,410
'If he is man enough, ask him to face me, 
I will show him!'

241
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,330
- So what now? 
- Nothing, my lord!

242
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,620
Sarkar is my father, mother, god and guru. 
You said those things about him...

243
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,450
...so I came to inquire.

244
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,660
You come to our area and dare confront us?

245
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,660
He's come right? What are you going to do?

246
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,700
Is that so?

247
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,620
Hey! Shut that door!

248
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,410
Why this tension? I will shut it.

249
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,790
He will shut it don't worry!

250
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,000
Why did you ask to shut the door?

251
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,750
To thrash him!

252
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,080
What are you waiting for then?

253
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,290
- You! 
- Just a minute!

254
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,200
- Paapu... 
- I can't thrash these guys!

255
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,540
Didn't ask you to... 
Sarkar will call, just 'manage' him.

256
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,830
As predicted, Sarkar is calling.

257
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,790
Sarkar!

258
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,000
Don't let him know I called.

259
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,750
Cunning duo know each other inside out! 
I'm trapped in the middle!

260
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,120
Tell me, Sarkar!

261
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,620
What is he doing?

262
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,660
- Breaking... 
- What?!

263
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,540
...I mean breaking coconuts!

264
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,540
Who is this guy?

265
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,580
Hey! What are you doing?

266
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,290
- Sit properly! 
- Sitting!

267
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,750
Go quickly and visit the god!

268
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,160
God has been viewed. 
He is now distributing sweets!

269
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
You please proceed with your prayers!

270
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,160
What are you saying? 
Give him the phone!

271
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,160
- Krishna? 
- Yes Sarkar...

272
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,870
- Oh auspicious time? 
- Yes, yes

273
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,160
- Get a viewing and come back quickly. 
- Ok, Sarkar

274
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,950
...I'm Rana's man!

275
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,410
Rana who?

276
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,290
The king of Ranasthalipura!

277
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,000
Does your Rana have horns or something?

278
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,870
Let me go! I'll say no more.

279
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,290
Never again about Sarkar. 
Forgive me!

280
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,250
A mistake can be forgiven once... 
that's why...

281
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,080
If you say anything else again...

282
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,870
I won't say anything!

283
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,660
Remove clothes, thrash them, wear clothes 
again! What is your problem?

284
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Hey, you know nothing of Sarkar.

285
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,120
- You are such a Paapu... 
- Oh, God only can understand

286
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,540
Who has installed this cutout 
in the middle of the road?

287
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,410
It's a public inconvenience! 
Get it removed...

288
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,830
Hey, who installed this cutout?

289
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,830
Sir no idea. I am not from here.

290
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,700
- I know nothing, let me go sir! 
- Hey...

291
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,120
Sir you are new to the place.

292
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,080
You have no idea whose cutout this is.

293
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,700
Is he some leader or patriot?

294
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,620
Neither, sir...

295
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,790
Who then?

296
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,580
He is...the king of our place!

297
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,370
For hundreds of years, 
their family has ruled here.

298
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,580
Everyone here venerates him.

299
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,830
Any work in this land must begin with him.

300
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,250
He decides who the MPs and MLAs are.

301
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:19,830
No one can question his pre-eminence.

302
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,200
If you do...

303
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,120
What will he do?

304
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,870
King or minister, a wrong is a wrong.

305
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,660
The law is equal for all.

306
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,540
I will remove it myself.

307
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,120
How dare you assault the police?

308
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,450
My lord, he's a newcomer. 
He didn't know what he was doing!

309
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,870
Not him, it, my lord!

310
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,700
I am Rana. Raja Rana Pratap Varma!

311
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,080
Governments change, only the king remains!

312
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,120
Rana is defined by 
a certain characteristic.

313
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,580
If there's a wedding, I must be the groom.

314
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,580
If it's a death, I must be the corpse.

315
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:34,160
The primary honor is always mine.

316
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,870
How dare you touch my cutout?

317
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,410
No, my lord. I will make him understand.

318
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,450
He didn't know he was making a mistake.

319
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,950
Sir, let's go...

320
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,500
Wait!

321
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,750
Salute me!

322
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,200
He will, my lord...

323
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,290
Sir, salute him...or else he'll kill you. 
Please salute him!

324
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,040
Can't you walk quietly? 
-Okay, okay...

325
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,870
He's sitting right here. What to do?

326
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,660
- Beating over? 
- Huh?

327
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,950
- He calls again... 
- I meant, your beat over?

328
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,370
I will use the toilet...

329
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,910
No...I won't

330
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,540
What is he trying to do here?

331
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,120
Where is the offering? No sweets?

332
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,790
Offering? The temple was closed when we went.

333
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,290
He is joking since morning! 
No limit to his jokes!

334
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,290
Here you go...

335
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,660
Not gone home yet?

336
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,500
I waited for you to come.

337
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,660
They'll be waiting...you go. 
-Right...

338
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,410
I have a doubt.

339
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,250
Is this from the northern temple 
or the southern one?

340
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,620
Go, go to sleep....

341
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,950
Eat them and sleep... 
Brother, laddoos from the temple.-Coming-

342
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,250
- You carry on... 
- Yes, Sarkar...

343
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,870
Not you Paapu...carry on

344
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,700
Right Sarkar...

345
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,000
I thought I managed him on the phone...

346
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,660
Did he remove his shirt and thrash them?

347
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,580
Thrashed them well?

348
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,620
Washed them with dirt!

349
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,750
- You take a small boy... 
- Small boy??!

350
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:53,080
- To a fight? 
- Me?!

351
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,750
I know my son...

352
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,910
Anyone who meddles with me, 
they're finished.

353
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,370
He's beating me up instead of him...

354
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,040
- Told him all of it? 
- Yes

355
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,620
Can't you shut your mouth?

356
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,540
Father and son know each other well...Ah!

357
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,370
It's bad times for me....

358
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,790
Put it up...

359
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,870
Rukmini Constructions Chairman 
Gajanand Deshpande...

360
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,580
...suddenly announces 
his daughter's engagement?

361
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,700
Dad fixed the match. 
He knows what's good for me.

362
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,830
Hey come...

363
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,410
His father and I are developing a 
big property in Mumbai.

364
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,830
He is their only son.

365
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,000
With this marriage, 
our relationship will grow further.

366
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,160
So will my business.

367
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,200
For business, you will 
marry her off to a stranger?

368
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,950
Did my mother know 
my father before marriage?

369
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,790
Weren't they happy?

370
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,370
They have double my wealth.

371
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,000
My daughter will surely be happy.

372
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,330
I believe in God.

373
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,700
My man will surely take care of me.

374
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,870
These are the prospective 
brides for Krishna.

375
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,580
I know my son well.

376
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,200
Till he becomes National Champion, 
he won't marry.

377
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,500
Don't try to approach him this way.

378
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,450
He's insane...

379
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,000
Isn't this a bit too much?

380
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,290
Why are you laughing?

381
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,790
- I don't believe it! 
- What?

382
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,700
I don't believe you don't drink.

383
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,120
Hey, what do you mean you don't believe?

384
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,580
I don't believe you... 
-Hey!

385
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,410
I swear on that cat there!

386
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,290
If I drink...

387
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,540
You know what happens 
when a pledge is broken right?

388
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,700
- I know, I know... 
- Then?

389
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,160
He dares advise me...

390
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,040
By the way, why are you drinking?

391
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,950
Love failure...

392
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,370
Can a question paper fail in an exam?

393
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,330
- No... 
- Who is that fails?

394
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,200
- Those who write... 
- Exactly!

395
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,290
Can love ever fail?

396
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,620
It's lovers that fail.

397
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,410
And you failing is no surprise, Paapu.

398
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,910
What do you know about true love? Hey!

399
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,370
You just swore you won't drink! 
Yet you finished it off.

400
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,160
Oh right! Don't worry, what can happen?

401
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,870
Come here, listen carefully...

402
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,410
Love is like a six-pack. 
Very difficult to achieve.

403
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,620
Maintaining it is even harder.

404
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,540
But friendship...look down. 
Your stomach...

405
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,120
Like this, it comes easily.

406
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,410
After it comes, even if you refuse it... 
it will stay till death.

407
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,000
In such a case, why this love and stuff?

408
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,250
Guys who talk this way are the first 
to fall in love and get married!

409
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,580
What are you saying?

410
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,950
- Fall in love I say! 
- Who are you saying it to?

411
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,500
To you.

412
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,660
- Telling me? 
- Yes!

413
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,870
Sarkar says we must not fall in love...

414
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:24,200
That's why Hanuman and Sarkar 
are celibates. Me also brahmachaari.

415
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,410
I swear on you I won't marry. 
I won't fall in love.

416
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,660
I swear on you!

417
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,200
You tell me? Me?

418
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,540
Get going home soon!

419
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,290
Drunkard!

420
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,330
He swore on the cat, and it died!

421
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,330
He has sworn on me he won't fall in love... 
what of me?!

422
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,790
If I am to live, he must not 
fall in love...not marry...

423
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,370
I must find a way out.

424
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,000
A pair...pick a card.

425
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,950
The wedding of Seetha and Rama.

426
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,870
Your prospects of a wedding are bright.

427
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,870
Your star sign indicates you will marry.

428
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,040
Impossible! He is a celibate.

429
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,450
He has vowed he won't marry! Don't you...

430
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,000
What he's saying is....

431
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,250
I am Hanuman's disciple...

432
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,540
- Hanuman himself says it! 
- What?

433
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,250
You will find your Seetha. 
Go and marry her!

434
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,040
Really? Is this guy an astrologer?

435
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,160
He's lying for money.

436
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:51,370
Swami, don't just wag your tongue.

437
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:57,160
You dare call my astrology a lie?

438
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,450
Hanuman himself will come...

439
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,870
...show you your Seetha.

440
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,330
You will see her.

441
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:13,040
When you meet her, Fire, Water, and Wind 
will be witness to your love!

442
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,580
Write this down!

443
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,370
Lakshmi, goddess of wealth!

444
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,080
If I get it, I can drink tonight!

445
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,580
I have to get it somehow!

446
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,120
Pappu?

447
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,080
He's asking the music teacher 
to act as Hanuman...

448
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,910
- What do I do? 
- Pappu!

449
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,040
Rama!

450
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,040
Rama, yes you...

451
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,830
No, I'm Krishna...Namaste...

452
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,580
Does Hanumantha know 
Krishna or Rama?

453
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,160
Rama...

454
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,290
Then? Seetha awaits you there.

455
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,160
Go Rama...go!

456
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,290
How did Krishna enter the Ramayana? 
So confusing...

457
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,580
Lakshmi, please stop!

458
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,750
Where are you going?

459
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,410
Lakshmi, where are you going? 
Stop...

460
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,250
I'm coming...got you!

461
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,410
Got her...Lakshmi!

462
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:50,080
'When you meet her, 
your love will be witnessed by Fire...

463
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,620
Water!

464
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,120
Wind!

465
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,120
I saw Seetha today...

466
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,330
Where?

467
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,830
What a dignified bearing! 
How she speaks!

468
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,500
Who is he speaking of?

469
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,950
Isn't that our tradition?

470
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:47,870
When I see her, I feel...feel...

471
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,410
- What do you feel? 
- Let me tell you...

472
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,120
She's like...a pillar of a fire...

473
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,620
I feel like worshiping her.

474
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,450
I feel the astrologer's 
predictions will come true...

475
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,660
Don't you believe such guys!

476
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,410
Hey, Hanumantha himself has said so.

477
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,950
See there, that Anjaneya! 
Let him say so, and I will believe it.

478
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,870
Look, look there! 
Anjaneya has himself indicated it!

479
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,950
That's not a lady...it's a body!

480
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,620
Look there!

481
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,910
Hey, it's you!

482
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,700
Can you come here a minute?

483
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,450
I am the one she called.

484
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,580
You go ahead.

485
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,790
I'm in big trouble. 
Can you please help?

486
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,620
Anything! Shall I kill him?

487
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,500
Can you go to the wine shop... 
and get four beers?

488
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,500
What did you say?

489
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,540
Beer...

490
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,950
- Strong... 
- Strong!

491
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,910
- Chilled... 
- Chilled! What a tradition!

492
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,250
Also cigarettes...

493
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,790
Cigarette...so cultured!

494
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,080
What else?

495
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,910
Gutkha...

496
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,830
Will you get these for me?

497
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,370
- Pillar of fire! Standing, flowing,... 
- That's it...

498
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,910
Here you go...

499
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,000
Thank you!

500
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,330
Wait here.

501
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,160
All of it here.

502
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,370
Change!

503
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,040
Thank you.

504
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,870
He's venting his anger about 
the girl on the dummy.

505
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,500
If it was the girl...

506
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,910
Hello, wrestler, which way are you heading?

507
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,120
Brother, going to drink water...

508
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,080
Going to drink water or...

509
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,120
...pouring water over your achievements?

510
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,870
Brother, that girl...love...

511
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,250
Hey, love is one big lie.

512
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,290
Forget it! 
What has happened to you?

513
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:48,040
No brother, I see that girl 
and I think...traditional, cultured...

514
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,200
Tradition and culture? 
You know better than me?

515
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,950
If you believe that, you are a dupe!

516
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,910
You know sugarcane husk right? 
-yes-

517
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,660
They will squeeze you dry like that!

518
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,830
What's wrong with you? 
You are a wrestler.

519
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,950
Only wrestling and the 
championship in mind.

520
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,950
No distractions, 
do you understand?

521
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,160
No distractions...

522
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,410
Look and learn.

523
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,370
Take this... 
-what is this?-

524
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,750
Wet trunks, wear it.

525
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,450
You will cool down.

526
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,080
Hey, idle fellow! Get over here.

527
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,160
Coming boss.

528
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,040
- Search there? 
- Beer baby!

529
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,830
Okay

530
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,410
There is a proverb which says 
'don't get ants in the pants'

531
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,160
I say nothing will happen. 
Want to see?

532
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,500
More gutkha, cigarettes, beer?

533
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,830
Our boy will get it.

534
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:49,290
Who?

535
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,160
That guy who got it 
that day for you!

536
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,620
- Can we meet him? 
- Sure, please come!

537
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,870
- Krishna! 
- What?

538
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,040
Why are you shouting?

539
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,450
- The beer girl is here! 
- What?

540
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,830
She wants more.

541
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,830
She thinks you are a beer broker. 
Show her her place!

542
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:03,830
Get her here.

543
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,500
Madam, all set. Please go.

544
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:11,790
Look on boys...

545
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:17,750
The lamb is at the tiger's mercy. 
Love is finished!

546
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,830
I can't bear to see them fight... 
turn away boys.

547
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,540
Krishna will explode now! 
No idea what will happen after.

548
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,950
Let's listen.

549
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,660
Hey, no sounds yet? Why?

550
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,620
Come sit, please.

551
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,500
This is...you are looking good.

552
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,950
Krishna, the environment has changed.

553
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,160
What is going on?

554
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:49,790
Hey, that cigarette, beer, 
it's not for them!

555
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:52,750
Some bet with a friend.

556
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,700
They have no such habits.

557
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,330
Very good person! Innocent! Seetha!

558
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,450
Please sit.

559
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:05,660
Pappu listen, Hanumantha and 
the astrologer were right!

560
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,870
So sweet of you... 
I'm Rukku.

561
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,620
- Rukku? 
- Rukmini!

562
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,910
- Lovely name! 
- Yes, yes

563
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:17,160
- You are? 
- Krishna!

564
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,660
song(Missing)

565
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,620
O darling

566
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,330
Let's see you wink

567
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,660
Hold my hand

568
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,950
O pearl among women

569
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,790
No space to breathe

570
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,620
Only god knows of this heat in me

571
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:30,910
Nothing is in my grasp

572
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,910
O darling

573
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,290
Let's see you wink

574
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,700
Hold my hand

575
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,410
O pearl among women

576
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,870
The spell of her sidelong glance

577
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,870
Slides into my eyes

578
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,500
The love story begins

579
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,910
The path of joy

580
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,290
The boy loses his mind over her jewels

581
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:36,000
With each breath Passion rises

582
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,040
O colorful butterfly, o beautiful vision

583
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,950
I offer flowers for your hair

584
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:14,950
Time unmoving, hatches in me love

585
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:22,330
The touch of you like lightning strikes

586
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:26,830
The celibacy of youth crumbles to dust

587
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,750
He moved carefree and stubborn

588
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,910
With your touch, he lost his courage

589
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,580
O Kalyani O Kasthuri

590
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,870
Come hold my hand

591
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,160
O darling

592
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,750
Let's see you wink

593
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,660
Hold my hand

594
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,160
O pearl among women

595
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,860
In lieu of the coming 
Dussehra celebrations...

596
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,610
Sri Vijayadurga Institution has 
organized a special wrestling match!

597
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:03,200
Only four of the foremost wrestlers 
in Karnataka have been chosen.

598
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,610
Among these, from Gajendragar, 
Sarkar's Sri Veeranjaneya Gymnasium...

599
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:09,610
Pailwan Krishna has been selected.

600
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:17,030
Please see your son attends.

601
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,320
Our fortune...he will come for sure.

602
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,450
We are very happy to hear this.

603
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,150
Boss, when is the wrestling match?

604
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,950
Tomorrow night.

605
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,450
Shall we have some fun on the way?

606
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,950
- Hey! That's Rukku! 
- Yes!

607
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,610
Madam, what are you doing here?

608
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,320
Going to Vijayadurga...car trouble.

609
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,700
We too are going there. 
We can take you...

610
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:02,950
Pappu! What are you doing here?

611
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,650
Weren't you in the vehicle?

612
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,070
He often fills the radiator 
and keeps getting out...

613
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,150
I'll take you, come...

614
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,990
He seems very excited...

615
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,450
Your the first one to see 
any feeling in him. Come...

616
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:21,200
Pappu, stay here, get 
the vehicle ready.

617
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,400
Why Vijayadurga?

618
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:34,490
Dussehra celebrations. 
A wrestler from Gajendragar is coming.

619
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:38,950
He's a sure bet to 
double your money!

620
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,610
Have you placed bets on him before?

621
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:43,740
No chance!

622
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:46,450
Do you know the guy?

623
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:50,490
He...must be some great man.

624
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,240
Huh

625
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,820
Great man...since he 
came to your notice?

626
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,110
- So you are going to see 
this wrestler? - Ya

627
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,280
- Can you drive? 
- Of course!

628
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:09,070
I drive well no?

629
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,860
Shall I drive fast?

630
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:33,570
Madam, jeep is finished!

631
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,490
- Sorry... 
- Forget it, your leg?-

632
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,780
I'm okay.

633
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,070
I'm thirsty.

634
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:44,650
Thirst?

635
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,360
Water here...

636
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,860
Will you wait here? 
I'll take a look.

637
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,400
Rukmini!

638
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,700
Are you okay?

639
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:31,700
This water is wonderful! 
Will you try some?

640
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,900
You drank that?-Yes!-

641
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,950
Rukmini, what are you doing?

642
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:44,700
Oops, hit that honeycomb...

643
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,360
Hey come on...those are bees not flies.

644
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,320
You are laughing?

645
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,490
The bees are gone?

646
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,360
No idea...

647
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,950
Do they have ears?

648
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,990
- So why are you whispering? 
- Anjaneya!

649
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,320
Afraid?

650
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,860
Afraid to be with me?

651
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,650
No no, why should I be afraid?

652
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,700
No fear is it?

653
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,140
Champion Krishna, from our Karnataka!

654
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:15,350
Yes sir...

655
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,640
A pure desi talent from Uttara Karnataka...

656
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,390
This who we are searching for...

657
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,550
Yes sir, he has trained from a very young age.

658
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:28,050
Please allow him to compete in the Nationals.

659
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,680
He will definitely win a medal for India.

660
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:31,600
Please sir...

661
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:33,220
-Do one thing. 
-Yes

662
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:36,050
At the tournament at Ranasthalipura next month...

663
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:37,970
...the National selectors are coming.

664
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:43,180
Let him participate, and then we'll see.

665
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:47,220
Definitely sir. He will surely win there.

666
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:55,140
First, let him participate. The only guy who wins 
there is Raja Rana Pratap Varma.

667
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,680
Exciting times at the Vijayadurga 
Dussehra wrestling competition...

668
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,510
Raja Rana Pratap Varma is wrestling with Kolhapur's 
Vikram Thakore.

669
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,430
Rana executes a superb move!

670
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,640
It's a terrific confrontation between the two.

671
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:17,220
This is a fight of equals.

672
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:29,350
Raja Rana Pratap Varma scores a fabulous victory!

673
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:34,350
Victory to Raja Rana Pratap Varma!

674
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,470
Where is Kichcha, not to be seen?

675
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,180
Hey Assault Paapu!

676
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:45,220
Who said Paapu? 
Oh, mother Seetha!

677
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,390
Come, sit here.

678
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,010
Hey, sit over there.

679
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,550
-My man will be back shortly. 
-Your man?

680
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:53,760
Your friend...

681
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:57,970
Oh! So many developments in a day!

682
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,550
-Just a little... 
-Not little but too much

683
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:03,350
At this rate, there will be kids.

684
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,930
Can you check where he went?

685
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,720
He will come. Watch for him okay...

686
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:17,600
Next match, Ranadir Singh and Pailwaan Kichcha!

687
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,970
Here he comes...your man!

688
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:25,600
Hi handsome!

689
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:34,550
Hey...I love you...

690
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,680
Yay, yes!

691
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,390
Yes...!

692
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:14,470
Hey, get lost!

693
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,800
Too much Kichcha!-Get lost man!-

694
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,470
Which is that line about the mustache?

695
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,300
You read it yourself...

696
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,140
Hey Krishna! Hi!

697
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,300
Hi!

698
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,640
Looking happy Rukkamma! 
What's the urgency?

699
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,760
-Errr, Daddy knows... 
-What?

700
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:49,760
I've told him everything.

701
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,140
How suddenly you spring it on me Rukkamma.

702
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:56,220
-Afraid? 
-...nothing like that...first time...

703
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:57,550
Nothing will happen.

704
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:00,180
Speak carefully okay? Come...

705
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,600
-Sir! 
-Kichcha...

706
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:15,970
Is that your name?

707
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,640
No sir, I'm Krishna. Kichcha is my nick name.

708
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,760
Sounds so stupid.

709
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,850
Here's a blank cheque. 
Fill in any amount you want.

710
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,050
Are you thinking of how much to write...

711
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,760
...or you don't know how to write?

712
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,800
I haven't studied sir, 
so I don't know writing.

713
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:41,100
Thumb impression...-yes- 
-Suits you!

714
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,760
Not surprised.

715
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:50,470
Okay, I will fill it in. 
Tell me the account details.

716
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,930
No account as well?

717
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,800
No sir, but I don't know why you're asking.

718
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,510
I know why you are behind my daughter...

719
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,300
...and I know what you want.

720
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,550
Oh like that...

721
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:18,930
I've not raised my daughter for a street loafer like you.

722
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,220
Sir!

723
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,010
Where are you going?

724
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:34,100
That is...shutting my mouth and pushing off!

725
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:38,100
Because, you'll say something, and I will respond.

726
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:42,010
It'll suddenly blow up into something else. That's why...

727
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:44,140
But if you say yes, I can speak!

728
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,890
Sir, I too got fooled like others.

729
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,760
Your palatial house, your cars... 
I thought you were a big man!

730
01:04:58,510 --> 01:04:59,350
Dude!

731
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:03,800
We mustn't speak of ourselves, but listen anyway.

732
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,930
I can't write, but outside...

733
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:18,220
...the elderly and young are filled with their love of me. 
That's all I want.

734
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:26,010
No account, but I have gathered some respect 
in the form of friends.

735
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:34,760
A rupee each with love from them, 
and I'll have more than you.

736
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:42,680
'If you tangle with me...if you do...'

737
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,390
I'm not one who speaks that way. No need.

738
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,550
One last thing!

739
01:05:54,970 --> 01:06:00,760
How can a guy like you have a daughter like that?

740
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:05,550
How? This I can't understand.

741
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:13,550
Also, I will always be your girl's husband...

742
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:18,180
...so I will be your son-in-law. Write it down. 
See you soon!

743
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,510
See you soon!

744
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,050
I've told you everything.

745
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,180
Think of it from a girl's father's point of view.

746
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:29,050
I have fixed her marriage. What...

747
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:32,970
-When is the wedding? 
-Next month

748
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,890
You prepare for the wedding. 
I give you my word.

749
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:42,220
There will be no trouble from my son.

750
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,890
That's the way. Give me five!

751
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,220
Whose car is that?

752
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,220
This Chinna always teases me this way... 
-Kichcha sir!

753
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,050
Namaskar! Can we speak?

754
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:06,100
Carry on.

755
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:13,220
I thought we shared the same dream so far.

756
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:17,850
Is it still the same? Or has it changed?

757
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:20,890
Why are you saying such things Sarkar?

758
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,510
You aim to be champ or not?

759
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,890
Of course! Why are you speaking this way?

760
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:34,680
Really? Or has something else become important?

761
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,430
No Sarkar...what else...nothing!

762
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:46,100
The National selectors are coming to Ranasthalipura.

763
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:51,390
Set aside all distractions.

764
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:57,680
Got it? Focus on wrestling...go

765
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:08,300
'You aim to be champ or not?'

766
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,390
'Has something else become important?'

767
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,180
'Focus on wrestling.'

768
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,350
What is all this Kichcha?

769
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,300
Nothing Appaji...the bike...

770
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,800
What didn't happen all these years...

771
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,430
...how come suddenly today?

772
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:03,180
Where was your focus, Kichcha?

773
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,050
Appaji...

774
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:10,010
Focus on wrestling.

775
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:14,680
A slight distraction, and you will lose your life.

776
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:24,100
He who sets aside desires, sacrifices himself 
and overcomes obstacles...

777
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:29,350
...only he can be a true wrestler. Only him!

778
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:40,760
Don't waste all these years of 
sacrifice and hard work.

779
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:49,970
Sister...

780
01:09:50,260 --> 01:10:00,850
We welcome our king Raja Rana Pratap Varma 
to the National Wrestling Championships at Ranasthalipura.

781
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:09,010
We also welcome Sarkar from 
Veerajaneya Gym and the National Selectors.

782
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:23,100
After these junior competitions, the most awaited match!

783
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:33,470
Gajendragar's Pailwaan Kichcha versus 
Raja Rana Pratap Varma!

784
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:35,350
Where is your son?

785
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:37,640
He will come sir.

786
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,850
The junior competitions are at an end.

787
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:54,550
We request the competitors of the 
next match to get ready.

788
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:58,550
Sarkar, today is that girl's marriage.

789
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,300
Rukku...-looking so pretty- Smile!

790
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:13,720
Pailwaan Kichcha has not yet arrived.

791
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:16,850
This has disappointed the spectators.

792
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:20,260
If he doesn't show up, 
-Scared to even show up!

793
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:25,350
...Raja Rana Pratap Varma will be declared winner!

794
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:34,550
I have always fought every match I have won.

795
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,640
He might come any minute, right Sarkar?

796
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,050
He will come...

797
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,050
Let us wait.

798
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,800
Our Pailwaan has arrived!

799
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,720
Bravery should be exhibited in wreslting arena...

800
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,600
...Not by doing accident

801
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:31,010
And Kichcha wins the match with that move!

802
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,600
Tear down his cutout!

803
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:54,640
-Down with Rana Pratap! 
-Kichcha!

804
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,290
You don't know the results of your mistakes!

805
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:33,580
No one has spoken to Sarkar like this before!

806
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:38,040
Dear, your father...

807
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:44,620
Sarkar, these two didn't know 
this would happen.

808
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,870
Poor children, they had no idea.

809
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,790
You know all about Sarkar.

810
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:57,290
You too know all about him...

811
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:58,870
-I don't!

812
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:08,370
-That is... 
-I don't know who stands in front of me!

813
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,700
This is not the child I raised.

814
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:19,450
Sarkar, what are you saying? 
He is your child....

815
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:22,660
Just because you're a friend, 
don't cross your limits.

816
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:30,410
I wondered if I could trust. 
This is betrayal of trust.

817
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:35,000
I will ask two things.

818
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:38,500
Ask if your husband will make it happen.

819
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:45,330
Definitely...He will do what you say.

820
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:54,080
He must stop training 
and wrestling from now on.

821
01:19:56,910 --> 01:20:03,200
Let him live happily... 
out of my sight!

822
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,700
Sarkar, what are you saying?

823
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:13,120
You are asking him to leave!

824
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:14,660
Where will he go?

825
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,660
He is your son...your son.

826
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,700
You will send your own son away?

827
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:26,790
The girl wanted to kill herself... 
that's why he got her home.

828
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:28,790
Krishna, come!

829
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:34,040
For the first time, my god asks 
something of me, Murthy...

830
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:40,290
I will give him my life.

831
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:03,950
That was the last we saw of him.

832
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:08,040
We don't know where he went 
or how he is doing.

833
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:12,330
He is not in touch with anyone since.

834
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:35,620
You sinner! You murderer!

835
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:36,500
-Yes, me

836
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,700
You said you won't sign itseems? 
- Yes

837
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,040
-Not even on the pain of death! 
-Good!

838
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:52,080
-O dear...let her go 
-Appa!

839
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,910
Why did you get her here?

840
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:00,580
Please!

841
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:22,000
Please let her go! I will sign on anything!

842
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,120
-What did you say? 
-I will sign...

843
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:26,500
Good!!!

844
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:28,790
Shall I read this once?

845
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:32,120
'My son suffered from a heart problem'.

846
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,830
'He didn't disclose it, and fought in the match'.

847
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:39,540
'The doctor's certificate says 
this is why he died'.

848
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:42,000
'I swear that this is the truth'.

849
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:54,120
-All good...but 
-But?

850
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:56,040
If your coach doesn't appear at the court...

851
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,830
The ban will be surely revoked.

852
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:04,040
-Check this shop... 
-No, not good

853
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,620
How much? Can't reduce it...hey!

854
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,950
Hey, look where you're going!

855
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,540
Brother, why this panic? What happened?

856
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,700
-He is right here! I saw him!

857
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:45,660
-Who?

858
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:47,540
Pailwaan...

859
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,620
Who is he? Where?

860
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,370
There...

861
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:42,790
What do you need brother?

862
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:44,290
Biscuits for her.

863
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,450
Wait here...

864
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:49,790
-That cream biscuit. 
-Rukkamma!

865
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,040
Where are you?

866
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:53,370
In your Heart...

867
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,660
-Come quickly! 
-Why?

868
01:25:59,080 --> 01:25:59,620
Feeling shy?

869
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:04,410
-Principal waiting! 
-Okay...

870
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,750
Sister, what's special today?

871
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,950
-Our wedding anniversary! 
-Really?

872
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:19,450
My gift to you... 
May you live long and well.

873
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:24,370
I will take leave... 
Jasmine, rose, flowers for sale!

874
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,870
You and I  
I and you

875
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:07,950
Are now one  
This my heart accepts

876
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,620
Nothing more needed

877
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:14,700
You have taught me all about love now

878
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:21,410
I will stay by you, bring happiness

879
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:28,500
I am your shadow this life and the next

880
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,200
You and I  
I and you

881
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:35,250
Are now one  
This my heart accepts

882
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,330
Nothing more needed

883
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:42,080
You have taught me all about love now

884
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:03,500
Let us embrace in love all day

885
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:07,250
Let us play the game of love

886
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:10,370
Let us overcome difficulties

887
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:13,790
Let us live like all the rest

888
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:19,830
This is the reward

889
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:26,450
The feast of marriage in our new nest

890
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:29,540
You and I  
I and you

891
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:33,540
Are now one  
This my heart accepts

892
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:36,580
Nothing more needed

893
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:40,660
You have taught me all about love now

894
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,750
Who has no troubles?

895
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:17,410
No lack for lovers

896
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:20,910
We will live without losing

897
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:23,950
The world is now envious

898
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:36,500
Everlasting love at dawn and dusk   
can now begin in the season of rains

899
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,790
You and I  
I and you

900
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:43,830
Are now one  
This my heart accepts

901
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:46,750
Nothing more needed

902
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:50,700
You have taught me all about love now

903
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:09,290
Sarkar!

904
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:20,580
Nothing...

905
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:31,080
So much time to make a throw!

906
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:35,620
Get out...you next!

907
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:36,250
Right Sarkar.

908
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:38,450
Quick!

909
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,200
Useless fellows!

910
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:46,540
Looking for Krishna?

911
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,450
Looking for Krishna in everyone.

912
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:54,120
None of them is Krishna.

913
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:56,950
It's not possible for them too.

914
01:30:57,370 --> 01:30:58,660
I have forgotten him.

915
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:04,370
You can't, and that's why 
you gave away his gear.

916
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,040
You sent him out of the house...

917
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:11,500
...but not from your mind.

918
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,200
-All good, Kichchanna? 
-Yes..

919
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:21,870
Rukkamma!

920
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:39,700
Looking very nice. What's the matter?

921
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,500
You know what is special today?

922
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,700
Today...

923
01:31:47,950 --> 01:31:50,370
Yes!!!. There will be festival in our village.

924
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:54,040
The first ritual... 
the wrestling will begin in a week.

925
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,450
Sarkar will be happy today.

926
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:26,160
Ta da! How is it?

927
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:30,120
Even on our anniversary 
you just go to sleep?

928
01:32:30,870 --> 01:32:31,540
Surprise!

929
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:35,870
What else can one do?

930
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:38,540
Lots to do!

931
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,160
For now...

932
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,250
Take this.

933
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:46,330
-Saree? 
-Yes

934
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:48,750
-Should I wear it?

935
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:49,620
Yes

936
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,620
-Okay... 
-Hello!

937
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:53,160
I will help you wear it.

938
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:58,080
Rajasthani saree, it's very different.

939
01:32:58,290 --> 01:32:59,040
I will help you wear it.

940
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:01,200
-You?! 
-Then what?

941
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:04,250
I trained for four hours with the shopkeeper.

942
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,000
I will help you wear it.

943
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:09,000
What about Jaanu?

944
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:14,080
Jaanu, you wanted see that bird in the corner right?

945
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,200
Yes, dad!

946
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:16,660
Will you take your binoculars and go now?

947
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:17,540
Yes dad!

948
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:18,620
Go on darling!

949
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:20,950
How did I manage?

950
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,370
Appa, no birds there...

951
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:43,700
-Look on the left, sweetie!

952
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:44,830
-Okay, ma!

953
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:12,200
Amma!

954
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:16,500
Mmm...I'll look elsewhere...

955
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:19,160
She saw us.

956
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:21,950
So?

957
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:24,120
Then?

958
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:31,870
If she can understand, 
we must complete our work.

959
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:39,370
-Hello, everyone, step out please, 
an announcement!-what now?

960
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:40,450
Today's our wedding day!

961
01:34:41,330 --> 01:34:43,080
-I bought my wife a Rajasthani saree. 
-Really?

962
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:44,660
I'm taking them out for dinner.

963
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,200
-Wanted to let you know... 
-Okay

964
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:49,450
Yes, Appa helped Amma wear the saree!

965
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:52,790
Look, he got a Rajasthani saree...

966
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:55,330
Have you bought a blouse at least for me?

967
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:58,080
Oh, this fellow shows us men in poor light...

968
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:24,000
Master...

969
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:31,450
Brother, I saw Pailwaan Kichcha!

970
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:36,450
What are you saying? Say it again!

971
01:35:36,790 --> 01:35:39,660
I saw him... 
Living happily with his wife and kid.

972
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:40,660
Come quickly brother!

973
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:26,450
Hello brother...that's the house.

974
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:28,330
PAILWAAN

975
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:09,790
What can I offer you?

976
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:15,290
Your husband has given me enough.

977
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:19,450
But I'll still take some milk...

978
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,870
How are you Kichcha?

979
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,330
I'm good. You?

980
01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:31,000
Not good.

981
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:34,660
Not good for the past four years.

982
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,330
You just didn't defeat me in 
our village that day...

983
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,160
You broke our family's pride, respect!

984
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:47,250
In our village, I am the groom in any wedding... 
acceptable.

985
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:48,790
Accepted!

986
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:53,910
I'm the corpse when there is a death...all fine.

987
01:37:54,450 --> 01:38:00,830
But you came to my wedding and made me the corpse.

988
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,450
That I can't tolerate.

989
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:09,540
I feel anyone who laughs is laughing at me!

990
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,750
I can't step out of the house.

991
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:12,870
If you feel like striking me, do so.

992
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:14,790
I'm right here.

993
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:18,910
No!

994
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,330
I'm very relaxed now.

995
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,200
Now that I have met you.

996
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:25,330
Milk...

997
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:28,370
My blessings...

998
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:37,160
It's you who said, 
the victory must occur in the ring.

999
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:39,750
You must come to my village.

1000
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:43,450
As a Pailwaan. And I must win over you.

1001
01:38:46,450 --> 01:38:47,620
That Pailwaan won't come Rana.

1002
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:49,250
He will come!

1003
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,250
He will, because I will bring him.

1004
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:57,700
You know something?

1005
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:04,200
This laborer business doesn't suit you.

1006
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,330
As a Pailwaan...super!

1007
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,450
Where is your daughter?

1008
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:18,870
Such a sweet child it seems.

1009
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:21,120
Where is she?

1010
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:37,750
The Pailwaan must step out.

1011
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,410
I will fetch him.

1012
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:49,620
Hey old man, where are you?

1013
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:50,830
Come out!

1014
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:57,410
Come, come!

1015
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:04,870
Hey Tony!

1016
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,540
Hey coach!...sorry, ex-coach!

1017
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:13,330
Tomorrow's headlines! Read it.

1018
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:17,450
Champion Tony's ban revoked!

1019
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:21,080
Tony is back! 
He's back!

1020
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:23,700
What do you understand from this?

1021
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,120
The world needs winners!

1022
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:28,910
What is a loser like you 
doing with your life?

1023
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:32,250
Oh yes, you have this big 'bakery'.

1024
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,040
Producing all these 'biscuits'...

1025
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,620
You are crossing a line.

1026
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:40,200
You will definitely lose one day.

1027
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:44,700
You dream too big.

1028
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,080
You will make Tony lose?

1029
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:48,750
You may not even be alive next year.

1030
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:49,450
What do you say?

1031
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,830
But this year, if you have a suitable sample... 
bring it along.

1032
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,000
Let's see...

1033
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,700
Anyone you get will be...

1034
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:25,200
Shall I get you tea brother?

1035
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:26,290
No Ramanna.

1036
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:32,080
-Karim bhai... 
-Tell me Krishna

1037
01:41:32,370 --> 01:41:34,040
Sorry to bother you this late.

1038
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:35,750
No problem...tell me, Krishna.

1039
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:41,330
Karim bhai, I needed money for Jaanu's admission.

1040
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:45,870
My son, you don't have to beg me for Jaanu's fees.

1041
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:46,910
Come in the morning. 
I will give you the money.

1042
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:49,250
Thank you Karim bhai. 
I will return it soon.

1043
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:02,450
-Karim bhai! 
-Krishna!

1044
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:03,910
What happened?

1045
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:06,160
What could have happened?

1046
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:11,370
How are you Kichcha?

1047
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,290
I will bring the Pailwaan to my land.

1048
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:21,410
Getting angry?...No?

1049
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:26,580
No problem...I have waited four years.

1050
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:28,200
I can wait a few more days.

1051
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:31,910
The Pailwaan must come.

1052
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:36,500
Till then, I won't give up.

1053
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:55,370
Feel like beating me up? Do it!

1054
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:00,000
No, I want to say something to you.

1055
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,830
Don't mistake my silence for fear Rana.

1056
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:07,750
It's respect.

1057
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:11,830
If you respect wrestling and your opponents...

1058
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:13,200
Wrestling will respect you back.

1059
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:19,660
Had I lost to you that day, 
I'd be happy to have lost to a great wrestler.

1060
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:22,250
The sport is bigger than us Rana.

1061
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:26,910
I have promised Sarkar, 
who taught me wrestling.

1062
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:28,410
I stand by my promises.

1063
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,950
You are fooled if you think the Pailwaan will come.

1064
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:35,750
He won't...

1065
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,370
-Hello dear... 
-Yes dad

1066
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,910
Which garage did you say?

1067
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:55,870
-Basha garage, dad... 
-Basha garage...okay

1068
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:05,000
Sorry Karim bhai. 
I caused this to happen.

1069
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:08,290
Let it go Krishna. I am fine.

1070
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:13,580
Krishna, you wanted the money right?

1071
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:23,450
Krishna...

1072
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:27,000
Basha garage...

1073
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:15,080
-Salaam, how can I help you? 
-Namaskara

1074
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:17,700
My car is dented. Can you check?

1075
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,410
Please sit sir. I will take care of it.

1076
01:45:20,910 --> 01:45:23,370
-Suleiman check the car. 
-Yes bhai

1077
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:30,950
Stop right here

1078
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:33,330
See you brother!!!

1079
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:38,410
Krishna, if you don't mind, 
can I ask you something?

1080
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:41,330
-Sure...-Does Jaanu need to go to that big school?

1081
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:42,910
Why are you asking?

1082
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:45,330
For the rent you pay for that hovel...

1083
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:46,830
...you are working like a donkey.

1084
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:52,330
-Brother, why does the mother 
carry her child on the waist?-Why?

1085
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:54,250
So the child can see what the mother sees.

1086
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:57,450
But why does the father carry 
the child on his shoulders?

1087
01:45:57,950 --> 01:46:00,200
So the child can see what we can't!

1088
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,700
This is not a difficulty but a desire.

1089
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:07,120
And I'm a strong father!

1090
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:14,250
Hey Krishna, a good man like you 
will encounter no difficulties!

1091
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:17,660
My mistake, shouldn't have asked!

1092
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:25,120
I am reduced to this state 
after giving away to others!

1093
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:27,950
Now I am learning the business.

1094
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:31,200
Brother, we will work for Rs. 40,000/- 
Otherwise not possible.

1095
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,870
This is a TV ad. Boxing ad...very less money.

1096
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:37,200
Lots of work brother. 
We too are many.

1097
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:39,620
We can't work for so less... 
Let's go.

1098
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:44,910
What about you?

1099
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:47,870
I'll do the work, brother.

1100
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,620
What about co-workers?

1101
01:46:49,790 --> 01:46:51,700
I have none, but I can do it.

1102
01:46:51,910 --> 01:46:53,580
Just give me what you offered them.

1103
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:56,750
Just you? Lots of work, you know.

1104
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:57,910
I will do it.

1105
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,620
The material is there. Take it.

1106
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:03,290
Right brother, thanks.

1107
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:06,410
- Shekri 
- Yes brother

1108
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:10,250
- Check if he does the work correctly. 
- Okay

1109
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,250
I always thought money was the only thing.

1110
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:37,700
I gave no value to humanity and humaneness.

1111
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:42,870
I thought Krishna wanted to 
marry my daughter for money.

1112
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:47,080
But he showed me I was wrong.

1113
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,870
I am not here to make you suffer sir.

1114
01:47:57,290 --> 01:47:58,580
I wanted to speak my mind.

1115
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:03,750
One day, I couldn't find 
my daughter for an hour.

1116
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,620
I searched everywhere, 
but couldn't find her.

1117
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:13,040
A three-year-old missing for an hour...

1118
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:14,540
...and I almost felt like dying.

1119
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:18,580
Whereas you raised your daughter 
for twenty two years...

1120
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:20,870
...and I took her away in an instant.

1121
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:22,000
How you must have felt...

1122
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:24,910
Now I understand, sir.

1123
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:28,120
Forgive me.

1124
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,290
Dad...Jaanu!

1125
01:48:48,410 --> 01:48:49,790
How are you dad?

1126
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:52,330
That's when I realized...

1127
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:56,660
...humanity is important, not money.

1128
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:58,950
I came that day to rant to you...

1129
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:01,330
...not about Krishna 
marrying my daughter...

1130
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:03,660
...but because my business 
deal went awry.

1131
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:07,330
I am not a good father, Sarkar.

1132
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:11,910
He is...

1133
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:16,580
You, who raised him, are a good father.

1134
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:22,120
I beg you to forgive me for a 
mistake I knowingly committed!

1135
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:27,410
No dear, I'm waiting here. 
Yes, meal over.

1136
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,330
- Sir hello! 
- Hello, Paapu...

1137
01:49:29,370 --> 01:49:30,500
Where is our Kichcha?

1138
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:33,580
Here...I could only find his photo.

1139
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,870
I saw his photo at your gym.

1140
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,290
This is him right?

1141
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:37,910
Yes...

1142
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:40,580
Yes...this is our Kichcha.

1143
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:46,500
Sir, what are you looking at?

1144
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:51,750
Advertisement for the 
annual boxing tournament.

1145
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:54,500
Every time, the trophy was ours.

1146
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:57,620
But this time...

1147
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:09,830
By-two tea, please.

1148
01:50:10,370 --> 01:50:11,910
Sir, the photo...

1149
01:50:12,330 --> 01:50:14,620
- How much? 
- Ten bucks...

1150
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,700
- Photo of Basha's garage... 
- Huh?

1151
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:18,950
You know this mechanic?

1152
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:19,870
Yes indeed...

1153
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:21,910
- Him? 
- That's Krishna

1154
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,250
He's my neighbor.

1155
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,080
- A minute... 
- Hello?

1156
01:50:57,450 --> 01:50:58,830
RANASTHALIPURA

1157
01:51:57,290 --> 01:52:02,120
Welcome again to Ranasthalipura, Kichcha.

1158
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:07,660
I knew you'd come, 
that's why I called all the leaders around.

1159
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:10,290
Hey, all of you raise your heads.

1160
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:14,700
When he won that day, 
you all applauded and danced.

1161
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:18,450
You stomped on my cutout.

1162
01:52:19,370 --> 01:52:21,160
Today, I will win.

1163
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:27,000
You will celebrate and dance the same way.

1164
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:30,250
Let me go! Appa!

1165
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:31,500
Jaanu!

1166
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:33,040
Jaanu!

1167
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:44,700
Where are you going? 
I'm talking to you.

1168
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:51,950
He's just a watchman.

1169
01:52:53,290 --> 01:52:54,040
Tell me...

1170
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:02,580
Have you come as a father... 
...or a wrestler?

1171
01:53:03,370 --> 01:53:05,790
A father has come to fetch his daughter.

1172
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:19,870
Dear!

1173
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:37,580
Let me go!

1174
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:42,040
Where is your arrogance now?

1175
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:45,750
You are getting thrashed so easily...

1176
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:48,330
Pailwaan!

1177
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:49,370
Pailwaan!

1178
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:50,410
Pailwaan!

1179
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:52,200
I want the Pailwaan!

1180
01:53:55,450 --> 01:53:56,540
Up!

1181
01:53:58,950 --> 01:53:59,950
Dear!

1182
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:15,330
Come on guys push!

1183
01:54:22,830 --> 01:54:24,120
Dear...Jaanu!

1184
01:54:28,410 --> 01:54:30,450
Stop! He must still wrestle me.

1185
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:38,330
Hey! What is the drama about 
your promise to your father?

1186
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:40,950
You are an orphan, that's all.

1187
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:46,540
Where is the Pailwaan in you? Where?

1188
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:49,870
He's dead.

1189
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:51,450
Dead?

1190
01:54:53,910 --> 01:54:55,330
Dead?

1191
01:54:58,250 --> 01:54:59,290
Kill the girl...

1192
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:09,620
Appaa...

1193
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:12,040
Jaanu...

1194
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:59,250
My granddaughter!

1195
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:03,540
Don't even think of harming her!

1196
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,660
I'll cut you to pieces.

1197
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:43,410
You shouldn't have made this one mistake.

1198
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:04,870
So far, one set of accounts...

1199
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:08,450
From now on, we'll have 
a second account.

1200
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:12,330
You shouldn't have woken up the lion.

1201
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,000
I told you not to make mistakes.

1202
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:27,580
Never said you should tolerate them!

1203
01:59:28,830 --> 01:59:30,540
We need such guys in the police department!

1204
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:08,580
Save me...save me!

1205
02:00:08,830 --> 02:00:12,750
Arrest him!...He's a policeman!

1206
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:16,540
I'm just a watchman sir...

1207
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:17,290
- Hey...

1208
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:18,000
- Hey...

1209
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:19,620
- I'm sorry!

1210
02:00:19,910 --> 02:00:20,540
- I'm sorry!

1211
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:11,870
Can I speak to you please?

1212
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:18,910
Why didn't you come 
to see me all these days?

1213
02:01:19,830 --> 02:01:21,790
My mistake, darling, mistake...

1214
02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:26,620
My father says, Sarkar 
never makes a mistake.

1215
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:29,040
- Your dad said that? 
- Yes...

1216
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:36,330
I wasn't much of a believer...

1217
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:38,250
But now I believe.

1218
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:43,330
This mace led me to you from nowhere.

1219
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:46,660
It showed me your true form.

1220
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:52,200
Krishna and Kamsa were both wrestlers.

1221
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,540
Krishna fought for Dharma...

1222
02:01:55,750 --> 02:01:57,660
...and Kamsa for Adharma.

1223
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:02,910
The guy I trained for so long...

1224
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:06,040
...I didn't know he'd be Kamsa one day.

1225
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:08,950
He is a stain on the sport of boxing.

1226
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:13,620
I don't care if you think I'm selfish.

1227
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:19,080
To erase this stain, you must leave the 
wrestling pit and enter the boxing ring.

1228
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:28,950
- Is there money? 
- What?

1229
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:31,200
Money in boxing?

1230
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:32,910
Yes...

1231
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:34,250
How much money?

1232
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:39,330
I don't know Sarkar.

1233
02:02:39,870 --> 02:02:41,620
But I need the money for those children.

1234
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:43,620
Children?

1235
02:02:44,580 --> 02:02:50,290
Children...When I left home, 
I expected difficulties...

1236
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:52,410
...but it was very difficult.

1237
02:02:53,950 --> 02:02:58,370
Difficulty not as a laborer or poor man...

1238
02:02:58,950 --> 02:03:02,620
...I suffered since 
I didn't have you or wrestling.

1239
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:06,540
Dad...hi!

1240
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:11,000
I couldn't sleep.

1241
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:16,750
I would go running all night.

1242
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:21,200
I thought I could tire myself to sleep.

1243
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:27,660
I thought I suffered the most, 
but life showed me differently.

1244
02:03:31,410 --> 02:03:32,250
Those children...

1245
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,120
Time for a meal, come.

1246
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:35,450
You only worry about food.

1247
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:37,870
First work, then food.

1248
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:39,950
Shantakka, keep it there...

1249
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:42,750
- Give it to me, I'll do it. 
- She's the boss now

1250
02:03:42,830 --> 02:03:47,040
- Sushila? 
- Brother!

1251
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:51,200
Life was difficult at home.

1252
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:54,200
After father died, we all moved here.

1253
02:03:54,750 --> 02:03:59,620
Initially, it was tough... 
but now we are used to it.

1254
02:03:59,950 --> 02:04:02,830
It's like I have forgotten 
how to run.

1255
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:06,580
Where is Chinna?

1256
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:08,290
He's not here.

1257
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:09,500
Where is he?

1258
02:04:11,700 --> 02:04:13,790
He didn't want to come here.

1259
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:18,330
He always wanted to be a cricketer.

1260
02:04:18,450 --> 02:04:21,450
One day, mother scolded 
him to send him to work.

1261
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:25,250
He refused saying he wanted 
to play cricket and ran off.

1262
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:29,250
- Where are you going? 
- I won't work!

1263
02:04:29,370 --> 02:04:31,120
Don't go there.

1264
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:33,910
Chinna!

1265
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:02,000
We were the ones who 
laid that road afterwards.

1266
02:05:03,410 --> 02:05:05,000
It hurts so much...

1267
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:11,120
But we're used to it now.

1268
02:05:12,410 --> 02:05:13,450
What brings you here?

1269
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:16,120
How long Sushila?

1270
02:05:16,290 --> 02:05:17,950
Sir, coming.

1271
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:20,910
Brother, the supervisor is calling.

1272
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:26,080
I'm so happy to see you.

1273
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:29,620
We live close by. Come again.

1274
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:31,330
I will go now brother.

1275
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:42,290
God gives everyone dreams.

1276
02:05:42,830 --> 02:05:45,250
He also gives them hunger.

1277
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:49,410
That hunger can eat up every dream.

1278
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:04,000
Brother!

1279
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:12,000
Come...will you do something for me?

1280
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:12,950
Yes brother...

1281
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:15,370
I will look after you very well.

1282
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,540
You must play again like before.

1283
02:06:19,330 --> 02:06:20,290
Come with me.

1284
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:22,540
I will care for you.

1285
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:24,750
Don't worry brother.

1286
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:27,370
Why? You don't believe me?

1287
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,750
I know you will keep your word.

1288
02:06:32,370 --> 02:06:33,200
Will you come?

1289
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:38,410
All these kids were like Chinna and me.

1290
02:06:39,250 --> 02:06:43,080
That's Divya, taluk-level kho kho player.

1291
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:45,950
That's Shruthi, kabbaddi player.

1292
02:06:46,410 --> 02:06:50,160
Here is Mahesha, district-level 
volleyball player.

1293
02:06:51,450 --> 02:06:55,870
Life has dragged all these people here.

1294
02:06:57,450 --> 02:06:59,200
How can I come away alone?

1295
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:03,370
We are not fortunate enough to play.

1296
02:07:10,290 --> 02:07:11,370
You are a good man.

1297
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:14,950
You want to fulfill at least her wishes.

1298
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:20,410
So many children right here, 
then how many in Karnataka?

1299
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:23,290
Will you fulfill all their wishes?

1300
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,410
Those who have hunger have no food.

1301
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:30,700
And those with food...no hunger.

1302
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:35,040
You need good fortune for everything.

1303
02:07:42,540 --> 02:07:44,580
'We are not fortunate enough to play'.

1304
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:47,330
Pole stars

1305
02:07:47,580 --> 02:07:50,250
Pole stars

1306
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:55,830
Thousands of them

1307
02:07:56,580 --> 02:08:01,700
Reside on earth too

1308
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:08,080
Without twinkling live in sorrow

1309
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:11,370
Pole stars

1310
02:08:11,910 --> 02:08:14,450
Pole stars

1311
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:27,000
trapped under the wheel of time

1312
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:33,120
O why this unwanted gift?

1313
02:08:54,290 --> 02:08:57,120
Piercing the eyes, right in front

1314
02:08:57,290 --> 02:09:00,120
The mirror of irony

1315
02:09:00,290 --> 02:09:02,790
How can I describe

1316
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:06,040
How can I bear

1317
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:09,370
Inciting a desire to climb the hill

1318
02:09:09,370 --> 02:09:12,120
He breaks your leg

1319
02:09:12,330 --> 02:09:14,870
In his gamble

1320
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:17,910
We are all victims

1321
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:23,750
Every drop of rain must turn into a pearl

1322
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:29,120
The time of human celebration must come

1323
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:35,620
A life of fairness we want this day

1324
02:09:37,370 --> 02:09:43,000
Pole stars

1325
02:09:43,700 --> 02:09:53,950
trapped under the wheel of time

1326
02:09:55,620 --> 02:10:00,830
O why this unwanted gift?

1327
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:30,660
What talents Sarkar...little kids.

1328
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:32,290
Little kids

1329
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,750
They can't afford two meals a day.

1330
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:38,410
So they have packed off their dreams 
and set them aside.

1331
02:10:38,410 --> 02:10:39,870
Working as coolies.

1332
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:41,910
I feel terrible.

1333
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:45,830
With another human by the side, 
no one is an orphan.

1334
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:50,290
A human is not someone 
who selfishly lives for himself.

1335
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:54,040
You taught me that one must help 
and show the way to his neighbors.

1336
02:10:55,290 --> 02:10:59,580
If my boxing can help their future, 
I will definitely fight.

1337
02:11:02,870 --> 02:11:03,870
If you agree...

1338
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:12,080
I only taught you to wrestle...

1339
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:15,040
...but you have learnt 
why one must wrestle.

1340
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:19,200
Even as a child, you fought for others.

1341
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:21,580
Even today you want to do the same.

1342
02:11:22,910 --> 02:11:26,450
I'm proud to say you are my son!

1343
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:29,700
He who fights because 
he is mighty is a rowdy.

1344
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:35,040
He who fights for a 
mighty cause is a warrior.

1345
02:11:43,750 --> 02:11:47,500
O warrior o gallant one

1346
02:11:48,580 --> 02:11:52,410
You shall be the winner

1347
02:11:53,000 --> 02:12:01,290
It is you, the world is yours

1348
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:06,790
Let the earth explode, the sky shake

1349
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:10,870
You fearlessly face the world

1350
02:12:10,870 --> 02:12:14,580
He who has a goal will win renown

1351
02:12:15,330 --> 02:12:19,450
Only a man with a mind will rise

1352
02:12:20,330 --> 02:12:24,700
Be victorious

1353
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:29,750
Surge forward

1354
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:42,120
It is you, the world is yours

1355
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:51,750
Surge through the crowd

1356
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:54,250
He who gets through wins

1357
02:12:54,250 --> 02:12:58,620
Let the cyclone in you awake

1358
02:12:58,790 --> 02:13:01,160
Defeat is worse than death

1359
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:03,120
The hero must never lose

1360
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:05,580
Your lineage is of the warrior Hanuman

1361
02:13:05,580 --> 02:13:07,750
Rise...

1362
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:12,500
Who will break whose records

1363
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:16,620
Who knows of tomorrow?

1364
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:21,540
Write your own history

1365
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:25,500
You are the mighty one

1366
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:29,750
He who has a goal will win renown

1367
02:13:29,910 --> 02:13:34,160
Only a man with a mind will rise

1368
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:37,830
Be victorious

1369
02:13:41,370 --> 02:13:43,040
Surge forward

1370
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:56,450
It is you, the world is yours

1371
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:08,700
Life is a journey on the sea

1372
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:10,750
Thunder and rain are natural

1373
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:15,290
The heart that swims to the bank is human

1374
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:22,540
This age is the servant of victors

1375
02:14:22,540 --> 02:14:24,620
You are your own guru

1376
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:26,910
Learn to win

1377
02:14:26,910 --> 02:14:29,040
It all begins here

1378
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:32,910
He who has a goal will win renown

1379
02:14:33,450 --> 02:14:37,910
Only a man with a mind will rise

1380
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:42,290
Be victorious

1381
02:14:44,450 --> 02:14:47,620
Surge forward

1382
02:14:51,950 --> 02:15:01,250
It is you, the world is yours

1383
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:16,830
This is the day, time, and moment 
we were waiting for all this while!

1384
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:20,620
This the first day of the Fair and 
Handsome Pro Boxing League.

1385
02:15:20,660 --> 02:15:23,870
We have twelve boxers 
from all across the globe.

1386
02:15:23,950 --> 02:15:27,660
They will fight over 
25 days in the tournament.

1387
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:30,910
Every match is a knockout match.

1388
02:15:30,950 --> 02:15:36,250
The winner takes home rupees ten crore!

1389
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:38,870
The crowds are filling the stands.

1390
02:15:38,910 --> 02:15:42,830
Now, everybody's favorite, 
the knockout specialist Tony Sebastian!

1391
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:52,000
Here's the knockout specialist 
King Tony!

1392
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:54,580
Look at the power of his walk...red hot!

1393
02:15:54,620 --> 02:15:57,500
Yes, but he has a tough opponent 
in front of him.

1394
02:15:57,540 --> 02:16:03,370
Tony faces the 7-foot tall 
tiger from Punjab, Kuljit Singh!

1395
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:05,410
Red...Blue!

1396
02:16:05,450 --> 02:16:06,830
He is so huge!

1397
02:16:06,830 --> 02:16:11,000
How tall is he! To meet his eye, 
we need an elevator!

1398
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:14,620
A suitable opponent for Tony today.

1399
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:17,250
- The match is bound to be amazing... 
- Fight!

1400
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:19,870
Here we go!

1401
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:27,830
This is what I call sheer power!

1402
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:29,660
Krishna...

1403
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,410
The next match is between 
Eugene from West Africa...

1404
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:54,790
...and our desi wrestling champ 
Pailwaan Kichcha!

1405
02:16:54,830 --> 02:16:58,330
This is Kichcha's first appearance 
in the boxing ring.

1406
02:16:58,370 --> 02:17:00,540
That too in such a grand stadium!

1407
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:15,700
Here's Eugene, the swagger!

1408
02:17:28,250 --> 02:17:31,700
Follow my orders throughout the match 
No foul play, no rabbit punches...ok?

1409
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:37,370
- Eugene tries intimidation! 
- He's doing it deliberately!

1410
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:39,700
Ready!. Move!.

1411
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,040
The bell rings...-Fight! 
-Here we go!

1412
02:17:56,580 --> 02:18:01,290
Boxing is not about strength 
but techniques too!

1413
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:04,040
-Kichcha, super! 
-Break!

1414
02:18:04,370 --> 02:18:05,540
Oh my god!

1415
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:08,250
Pailwaan Kichcha is using a wrestling move.

1416
02:18:09,790 --> 02:18:10,830
Fight!

1417
02:18:12,330 --> 02:18:15,160
-This is hilarious! 
-Come on Kichcha!

1418
02:18:16,830 --> 02:18:20,290
Eugene is in displaying his boxing skills

1419
02:18:22,830 --> 02:18:23,870
Break... Now!

1420
02:18:25,330 --> 02:18:26,830
That's the second warning.

1421
02:18:26,830 --> 02:18:28,040
You can't do that...

1422
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:29,250
Fight!.

1423
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:36,790
That's the third warning.... 
Next time you would be disqualified

1424
02:18:39,410 --> 02:18:41,580
-Bell...back to your corner... 
-That's the bell!

1425
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:44,250
The crowd is having a real good time.

1426
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:49,370
Listen to me carefully!

1427
02:18:49,410 --> 02:18:51,040
This is boxing not wrestling.

1428
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:53,620
He is doing the opposite 
of what you're thinking.

1429
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:55,830
You should beat him at his own game.

1430
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:58,000
Focus and counter him.

1431
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:01,540
Blue...red...

1432
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:03,370
The second round begins.

1433
02:19:03,410 --> 02:19:07,000
- Kichcha, don't let him go! 
- Kichcha tries a punch.

1434
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:07,950
He is unable to connect... 
But Eugene connects

1435
02:19:07,950 --> 02:19:09,870
Strike him, come on.

1436
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:23,200
- Eugene takes full advantage! 
- Punch him!

1437
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:25,830
Eugene escapes like thin air.

1438
02:19:42,370 --> 02:19:45,830
Are you serious?! 
What a hit! Superb!

1439
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:43,080
Come, don't worry about him.

1440
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,830
Hey bakery, how shall I 
eat up your little biscuit?

1441
02:21:52,830 --> 02:21:54,000
Hit...hit him! Go!

1442
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:55,950
Attack.

1443
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:59,120
Kichcha, use the hook.

1444
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:03,950
Hit him!

1445
02:22:11,370 --> 02:22:13,830
Move...move...move!

1446
02:22:27,620 --> 02:22:29,160
Oh no!

1447
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:07,080
Congrats Tony!

1448
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:08,290
How are you feeling?

1449
02:23:08,330 --> 02:23:10,540
Feels like a holiday!

1450
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,660
Tony, what do you want 
to say about your opponent?

1451
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:17,750
Pailwaan Kichcha!

1452
02:23:17,950 --> 02:23:19,910
Ooh...I'm scared!

1453
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:24,870
- Pailwaan Kichcha... 
- Namaste!

1454
02:23:24,910 --> 02:23:26,910
What do you say about 
your opponent Tony?

1455
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:29,830
Tony is a great boxing talent.

1456
02:23:30,410 --> 02:23:33,950
I'm happy to get a chance to box with him.

1457
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:39,830
You have left wrestling 
to enter boxing. Why?

1458
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:42,200
- For the money... 
- Money?!

1459
02:23:42,790 --> 02:23:45,620
Not for me...

1460
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:50,830
There are talented underprivileged 
kids on the street.

1461
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:54,700
If someone inspires them, 
tomorrow...

1462
02:23:55,580 --> 02:24:00,040
...they will become great sports persons 
of this country.

1463
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:01,250
That's what I believe.

1464
02:24:02,410 --> 02:24:05,660
Tony, what do you want to say 
about this finale?

1465
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:11,330
It's going to be short... 
...crisp and short!

1466
02:24:11,790 --> 02:24:14,830
Pailwaan Kichcha! Will you win?

1467
02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:19,290
I don't know if I'll win, 
but this I know.

1468
02:24:20,750 --> 02:24:23,660
I have never accepted defeat easily.

1469
02:24:25,750 --> 02:24:30,620
The new ray of hope for talented and 
underprivileged kids...Pailwaan Kichcha!

1470
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:34,410
Moving from wrestling to boxing, Kichcha...

1471
02:24:34,450 --> 02:24:37,040
...is endearing himself for his purpose.

1472
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:38,830
Children need sport as much as studies.

1473
02:24:38,830 --> 02:24:40,870
Everyone must support games for children.

1474
02:24:40,910 --> 02:24:45,250
I was a state-level volleyball player in school. 
But no one helped me progress further...

1475
02:24:45,290 --> 02:24:47,750
Kichcha is an example to 
both the state and the country.

1476
02:24:47,830 --> 02:24:49,080
His purpose is very praiseworthy.

1477
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:52,790
Our employees are donating a day's salary 
to encourage children's sports.

1478
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:55,410
If he fulfills his aim, 
our children too can play.

1479
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:56,950
If he wins, our children will win.

1480
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:58,620
God bless him!

1481
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:05,250
Kichcha has won the hearts of people, 
but will he win against Tony?

1482
02:25:05,290 --> 02:25:06,660
We have to wait and watch!

1483
02:25:12,410 --> 02:25:14,700
This is the moment we've 
been waiting for!

1484
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:18,120
This grandeur and excitement of the finale!

1485
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:21,580
Tony Sebastian vs Pailwaan Kichcha!

1486
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:26,910
He who has walked nine steps 
can easily walk the final one.

1487
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:32,790
But you can't reach your 
goal without that final step.

1488
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,450
The journey will not be complete.

1489
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:47,950
Sir, please come!

1490
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:55,950
Sir, it's the finals. If you don't come...

1491
02:25:58,330 --> 02:26:03,620
The moment I found an opponent for Tony... 
I already reached my goal.

1492
02:26:04,250 --> 02:26:08,080
Today is not my fight.

1493
02:26:08,830 --> 02:26:09,620
It's his.

1494
02:26:10,250 --> 02:26:12,370
This day must belong to him.

1495
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:16,160
He definitely doesn't need me today.

1496
02:26:17,290 --> 02:26:20,410
The purpose with which 
he has entered the ring...

1497
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:23,540
...will fuel his strength.

1498
02:26:23,910 --> 02:26:28,200
Welcome to the grand finale of the 
Fair and Handsome Pro Boxing League!

1499
02:26:28,250 --> 02:26:31,250
Introducing first, the desi wrestler...

1500
02:26:31,290 --> 02:26:34,410
Pailwaan Kichcha!

1501
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:20,370
Here's King Tony.

1502
02:27:24,660 --> 02:27:27,540
Please welcome the knockout specialist...

1503
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:30,290
Tony Sebastian!

1504
02:27:43,330 --> 02:27:45,120
Red.. Blue... To the centre

1505
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:47,200
Alright then... Let's do the drill once again...

1506
02:27:47,250 --> 02:27:50,950
You know the rules... 
but I still gonna repeat a few of them

1507
02:27:53,750 --> 02:27:57,330
Incase of a Knock Down, 
you go to the corner I tell you to

1508
02:27:57,330 --> 02:27:59,500
-Any Questions? 
-Tony sending out a strong message...

1509
02:27:59,580 --> 02:28:01,830
The fireworks have already begun!

1510
02:28:01,830 --> 02:28:04,290
Which means more sparks will fly!

1511
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:06,580
-Fight!

1512
02:28:12,370 --> 02:28:15,250
Kichcha tries to attack, but in vain!

1513
02:28:25,580 --> 02:28:28,870
A shower of punches on Kichcha 
before he can even react!

1514
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,160
This is very tough for him.

1515
02:28:41,870 --> 02:28:44,790
The punch must have 
surely damaged the ribs!

1516
02:28:49,450 --> 02:28:50,830
Stop! Back to your corners...

1517
02:28:55,910 --> 02:28:56,660
Sit Kichcha!

1518
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:09,330
Kichcha seems to be in a lot of pain...

1519
02:29:09,330 --> 02:29:12,540
...but looks determined. 
Good to see him charge...

1520
02:29:57,830 --> 02:29:59,040
You can do it.

1521
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:03,500
Thrash him...don't let him go!

1522
02:30:03,540 --> 02:30:05,580
The third round is set to begin.

1523
02:30:08,250 --> 02:30:10,700
Come on Kichcha! 
-He looks very determined...

1524
02:30:21,370 --> 02:30:22,290
Go back!

1525
02:30:26,620 --> 02:30:30,250
Come on!

1526
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:43,700
-Come on, go...

1527
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:51,330
Move out!

1528
02:31:02,330 --> 02:31:04,790
A nasty blow from Tony...

1529
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:11,040
Tony's coach asking him to watch out!

1530
02:31:16,330 --> 02:31:18,330
Well done Kichcha!

1531
02:31:48,870 --> 02:31:50,500
Stop, that's banned! 
-Oh my god...

1532
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:55,450
-Both the teams trying to separate the warriors. 
-Go back!

1533
02:31:55,450 --> 02:31:57,120
This match is up and alive!

1534
02:31:57,120 --> 02:32:00,040
This is anybody's game from here.

1535
02:32:03,370 --> 02:32:04,870
Kichcha, terrific!

1536
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:08,580
You can..C'mon...C'mon

1537
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:16,830
Round 4, and the game has now truly begun!

1538
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:38,250
Both boxers are tearing each other apart... 
This is insane..

1539
02:33:03,700 --> 02:33:05,370
This is truly a war!

1540
02:33:05,580 --> 02:33:09,330
First time Tony sits in his corner... 
He looks exhausted!

1541
02:33:16,370 --> 02:33:19,080
-Round 8...fight! 
-That's the start of Round 8.

1542
02:33:20,200 --> 02:33:23,540
What a match! What a finale!

1543
02:33:23,580 --> 02:33:24,290
Come on, hook!

1544
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:29,950
Thrash him!

1545
02:34:32,330 --> 02:34:35,700
1..2..

1546
02:34:42,830 --> 02:34:44,870
'You are my son.'

1547
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:50,330
'I'm proud to call you my son.'

1548
02:34:52,290 --> 02:34:54,910
'He who fights because he's 
mighty becomes a rowdy'.

1549
02:34:57,620 --> 02:35:00,160
'He who fights for a mighty cause...'

1550
02:35:02,250 --> 02:35:04,750
'We are not fortunate enough to play'

1551
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,200
'...becomes a warrior'

1552
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:18,910
Look! I see some movement!

1553
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:20,620
Kichcha is moving!

1554
02:35:39,160 --> 02:35:40,700
Are you okay? Ready to box?

1555
02:35:40,750 --> 02:35:43,620
Referee asks if he can continue. 
He says yes!

1556
02:35:43,830 --> 02:35:45,080
-Fight!

1557
02:35:59,290 --> 02:36:02,660
-The Pailwaan is in bad shape... 
-Doctor, examine!

1558
02:36:02,750 --> 02:36:04,330
The referee has called for the doctor.

1559
02:36:04,410 --> 02:36:07,870
Yes, Kichcha's eye is completely shut!

1560
02:36:07,870 --> 02:36:10,500
The doctor may disqualify him.

1561
02:36:10,660 --> 02:36:12,500
The match will finish this way.

1562
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:14,000
Tony will obviously become the winner.

1563
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,410
Can you see?

1564
02:36:16,410 --> 02:36:18,830
Alright.. How much is this?

1565
02:36:20,660 --> 02:36:21,410
Five!

1566
02:36:21,410 --> 02:36:22,160
That's good.. Ok

1567
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:23,830
I'll close your eyes...

1568
02:36:23,830 --> 02:36:24,580
Tell me now.. How much?

1569
02:36:26,290 --> 02:36:27,620
-Focus and look Kichcha. 
-How much?

1570
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:30,370
Four!

1571
02:36:31,080 --> 02:36:31,870
Good...now?

1572
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:34,290
Tell me.. How much?

1573
02:36:35,620 --> 02:36:36,200
Two!

1574
02:36:36,750 --> 02:36:38,830
-Good to go! 
-That's a thumbs up!

1575
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:14,290
Now Kichcha on the attack!

1576
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:17,120
Tony's taking a beating, 
but he hits back!

1577
02:37:20,910 --> 02:37:23,500
This is a street fight...no-holds barred!

1578
02:37:23,540 --> 02:37:25,910
Tony looking to finish Kichcha...

1579
02:37:26,410 --> 02:37:29,540
-Come on... 
-Kichcha come on!

1580
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:38,120
That's a cheap shot...

1581
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:39,330
That's a foul!

1582
02:37:39,910 --> 02:37:41,830
That's a warning! 
You can't do that.

1583
02:38:11,290 --> 02:38:12,870
Now he hits back.

1584
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:15,200
Go Kichcha go!

1585
02:38:16,830 --> 02:38:20,040
Left hook...another...and another!

1586
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:21,500
Oh my god!

1587
02:38:21,540 --> 02:38:25,370
He's raining blows like tracer bullets!

1588
02:38:48,580 --> 02:38:50,790
1...2...

1589
02:38:51,290 --> 02:38:53,040
3...4

1590
02:38:57,750 --> 02:39:00,830
8...9...10!

1591
02:39:00,830 --> 02:39:02,290
-He's out! 
-Yes!

1592
02:39:13,500 --> 02:39:16,660
Winner of the Fair and
