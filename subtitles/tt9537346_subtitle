1
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:04,708
"He keeps troubles
away from the kids."

2
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,791
'Life is precious.'

3
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,583
'Filled with joys and sorrows.'

4
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:21,416
'Begin your journey,
your feet await path.'

5
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:30,250
Oh God, keep the evil spirits away.

6
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh God, keep the evil spirits away.

7
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:41,791
Oh God, keep the evil spirits away.

8
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,166
Oh God, keep the evil spirits away.

9
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,458
Listen...

10
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,875
...the tradition of
lighting lamps during Baisakhi...

11
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,708
...was started by an elderly
sage from our village.

12
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,332
He used to say...

13
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:17,250
...that every individual should celebrate
every festival with fondness and light.

14
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,750
Fondness makes one strong...
and light spurs progress.

15
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,958
These lamps look so beautiful.

16
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,250
Amar?

17
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,208
What are you thinking, son?

18
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,583
You are neither looking
at the lamps nor at your meal.

19
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,250
Why aren't you eating?

20
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,416
Have you injured yourself?

21
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:39,333
Son, you need to
open your mouth to eat.

22
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Eat... eat!

23
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,083
Or do you want me to find
an auspicious hour when you can eat?

24
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:48,541
Oh God, keep the evil spirits away.

25
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,916
What are you chanting?

26
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Ratan said that ghosts...

27
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,541
There, definitely, are good and
bad people in this world...

28
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,375
But, there is no such
thing as ghosts, son

29
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,000
Such chants cannot
Exorcise the ghosts

30
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:32,582
Because ghosts just don't exist, son.

31
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,041
It is just a delusion.

32
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:41,458
The Pundit's son Ratan
says that ghosts exist.

33
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,333
World makes a lot of claims, son.

34
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,000
And tells a lot about
what is right and wrong.

35
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,833
Believe in the truth...

36
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,375
not lies...

37
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,250
What is truth?

38
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,166
A crop growing out
of the soil is the truth.

39
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,208
Bread cooking on
the stove is the truth.

40
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,750
Your mother's sigh out
of concern is the truth.

41
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,458
Your father's worry while returning
from the fields is the truth.

42
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,666
And yes, a person who doesn't
hurt anyone

43
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,666
...is honest and genuine.

44
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,083
Everyone's friend.

45
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,208
So, that means, Ratan and I
Have a true friendship?

46
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,208
And what is a lie?

47
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,250
Ghosts and spirits are a lie.

48
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,750
Chants are a lie.

49
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,041
Miracle is a lie.

50
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,625
Study hard.

51
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,208
Read books.

52
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,500
Then you will come
to know everything.

53
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,875
Books are the gateway to wisdom, son.

54
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,541
Our Guru's Bani is the truth.

55
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,416
Our Beloved True Guru always
holds the hand of an honest being.

56
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,916
Our Beloved True Guru?

57
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:05,833
"He keeps troubles
away from the kids."

58
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:12,791
"He always dwells in our heart."

59
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:21,750
"He walks with us,
doesn't let us a stray."

60
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:29,041
"Our Beloved True Guru."

61
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:35,875
"Our Beloved True Guru."

62
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:42,750
"Our Beloved True Guru."

63
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:49,000
"Our Beloved True Guru."

64
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:55,750
"If You are by my side..."

65
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,916
"I have nothing to worry about."

66
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,166
"You have entrusted
everything to me..."

67
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,833
"...when I became Your slave."

68
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:17,875
"Every ruin what you have by getting
jealous of someone else's progress."

69
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:25,000
"Our Gurus have taught
us to always share."

70
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,333
"Always share."

71
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:34,875
"He imparts knowledge
to those who are unaware."

72
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:42,041
"True Guru makes you
meditate on His Name."

73
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:49,999
"If He decides He can
even make the mute sing."

74
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:58,166
"Our Beloved True Guru."

75
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:05,041
"Our Beloved True Guru."

76
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:11,625
"Our Beloved True Guru."

77
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,708
"Our Beloved True Guru."

78
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:50,583
"He is the one who
spreads True Happiness."

79
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:57,250
"True Guru,
my Lord, is very Generous."

80
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,833
"He is very Generous."

81
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:07,750
"He is the one who
forgives our mistakes."

82
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,833
"He can be found everywhere."

83
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,666
"He keeps the darkness away."

84
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:22,291
"He even gives a second chance
to those driven by ego and pride."

85
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:30,708
"Our Beloved True Guru."

86
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:36,458
"Our Beloved True Guru."

87
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,958
Make sure you don't fall, Pundit.
Sit tight.

88
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:51,250
"Everyone visits
the fair all decked up."

89
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,041
Amar, please ride carefully...

90
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,708
Why are you scaring me?

91
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,875
Now you know that
one's own deeds are the true ghosts.

92
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,249
- They keep scaring others.
- I said I won't give that away.

93
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,291
- Hey?
- Yes?

94
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,041
Shall we scare Lambar's father?

95
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,875
Oh God, keep the evil spirits away.

96
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,375
Stop chanting Pundit,
just wait and watch...

97
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,458
You'll get us in trouble...
they are with their sticks.

98
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,291
It's okay, kiddo.

99
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,249
What goes around comes around.

100
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,000
Youth quickly passes away
while old age seems to last forever.

101
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,500
He nearly killed us!

102
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,333
This is a limit.
What kind of a joke is this?

103
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,458
Amar Singh,
As you sow, so shall you reap!

104
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,250
Do you remember Lambar's father?

105
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,375
He was right.

106
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,999
Youth quickly passes away
while old age seems to last forever.

107
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,541
A lot has changed.

108
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,583
Nothing has changed, brother.

109
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,207
Everything is just the same.

110
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,500
You met Azan Lahori (talking about himself)
in a sawmill in the year 1979...

111
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,582
He is still the same

112
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,333
Not much has changed
for you two either.

113
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,166
Everything has changed, my friend!

114
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,625
The one who would listen to me,
understand me, scold at me...

115
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,291
...my wife passed away.

116
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,375
I too am not the same
person I used to be.

117
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,583
Now I feel like passing
on to the other world.

118
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,208
Everyone has to die one day.

119
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,458
But no one is able to take
control of one's own death...

120
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,250
My wife too passed
away around 10 years ago.

121
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,082
I used to say that
I'd die without you.

122
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,541
I didn't die.

123
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:43,708
Pundit, you killed your wife with
your talismans and sacred threads.

124
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,333
If you want,
I can use a few chants to kill you.

125
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,250
Don't you dare say another word...
I'll punch your nose hard enough

126
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,458
...that you'll end up,
straight, in Lahore.

127
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,458
Causing additional 5-6 casualties

128
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,583
It is pointless to
discuss this pundit...

129
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,000
Because, nowadays,
you eat unsweetened rice pudding

130
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,000
And today is Friday which you
don't consider good day for yourself

131
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,582
Bye, my friends.
See you tomorrow then.

132
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,541
We shall shake hands tomorrow then,
for the last time...

133
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,291
Why?

134
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,541
Ratan Sharma, have you forgotten?

135
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,875
You were the one who used to say...

136
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,708
...one shouldn't ask questions
while one is departing.

137
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,541
Huh?

138
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,208
Dad, can't we even
ask about your whereabouts?

139
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,250
Binder, my child, people
of my age just sit back and relax...

140
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,916
Whereas I, on the other hand...
wash my own utensils.

141
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,290
Do the laundry

142
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,333
drop Jhanda to school.

143
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,708
pick him up as well.

144
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,665
feed him after he returns.

145
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,208
And just when I'm back
you're questioning me...

146
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,000
...where was I all day long?

147
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,125
Dad, I asked because I was worried.

148
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,958
No one is idle here.

149
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,875
I too work for 10 hours.

150
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,208
I bear half the
expenses of this house.

151
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,250
I don't understand
why are you overreacting.

152
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,250
What is your problem with me?

153
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,000
I have a problem with you?

154
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,333
Or you have a problem with me!

155
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,333
What do you mean?

156
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:16,208
Dear, I mean you feel that
you are the one who's most distressed

157
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,625
And I feel that I have
no happiness in my life...

158
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,333
Only after I die,
I think, I'll be happy.

159
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,041
Don't exaggerate the matter, dad.

160
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,416
You are wise...

161
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,458
Oh, so I am a fool, here!

162
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,708
Binder, you too are wise

163
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,208
Khushwant, this is between me and
my daughter-in-law

164
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,583
How does it confirm
(mispronounced by the child) you?

165
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,625
It's how does it concern you!

166
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,333
Yeah, same thing!!

167
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,707
- Dad, I...
- I guess you didn't hear what Jhanda said.

168
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,999
Jhanda said, this is between me and
my daughter-in-law

169
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,708
- Right, Jhanda Singh?
- This is too much now.

170
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,291
I know you purposely
Call Agam as Jhanda... Jhanda...

171
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,500
To irritate me.

172
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,875
This is a limit, dear.

173
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,416
No it's not!
It has crossed all limits...

174
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,833
Just can't take this anymore.

175
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,791
It's for the last time.

176
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,875
You know what dad?

177
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,333
I cannot argue with you every day

178
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,250
Okay, dear.

179
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,083
If you cannot tolerate me anymore...

180
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:25,375
[Praying]

181
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,666
Papa!

182
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,583
I have explained you several times...

183
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,958
Don't light these incense sticks.

184
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,083
This is Canada, not India.

185
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,040
Do we worship another God in Canada?

186
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,000
Earlier I used to pray inside.

187
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,208
Then started doing it in the garage.

188
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,166
Now I am sitting out in the open.

189
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,125
I am your father.

190
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:50,416
But I fail to understand you have
problem with these burning incense sticks

191
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,416
...whereas your own
temperament is so fiery

192
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,875
Very well said, my father-in-law.

193
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,041
What did you say?
Say that again.

194
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,583
I was just saying that
I pray for you both

195
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,791
Once God blesses
you two with a child...

196
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,000
...I'll happily depart
from this world.

197
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,666
Papa, I don't want anything.

198
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,416
Just stop interfering in our life.

199
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,458
Your life is my life.

200
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,041
God will definitely answer our
prayers by blessing you with a child

201
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,083
The Doctors have given up.

202
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,166
There is no chance of a baby.

203
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,249
You will,
definitely, be blessed with a child.

204
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,458
God is miraculous, Leela.

205
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,625
I am your daughter and not a son.

206
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,625
You know what your problem is, papa?

207
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,916
You don't know how
to live in the present.

208
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,708
- And these incense sticks?
- What are you doing?

209
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,666
This is the last
time you're using it.

210
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,958
Do you understand, papa?

211
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,708
Last time.

212
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:08,916
"When getting into the
palanquin Heer screamed..."

213
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,958
Well done, grandpa... well done!

214
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,041
When getting into the
palanquin Heer screamed...

215
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,208
...she said,
father give me some cash...

216
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,166
...I have paid off all
the instalments of your loan.

217
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,625
Entire day, you keep cracking silly
jokes, humming useless poetry...

218
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,708
... telling irrelevant stories
and laughing without a reason.

219
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,000
Act your age, father!

220
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,500
Smiling and being happy
is a form of worship, Shaizad.

221
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,041
And father, if Lahoris will
stop cracking jokes and laugh...

222
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,041
...then the world
will come to an end...

223
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,458
- Am I right?
- Right.

224
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,791
Just like your grandfather, either eating
or wandering around, aimlessly, whole day.

225
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,500
I worked all my life, Shaizad.

226
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:03,500
And Shabnam too works
besides studying.

227
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,250
He is right.

228
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,541
Shameless girl,
sitting there without any shame.

229
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,625
[Sarcasm] She isn't sitting,
she is standing.

230
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,166
It is getting difficult
to keep you with us.

231
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,750
Keep me if you want to.

232
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,250
Otherwise, I'll rent a
basement and start living there

233
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:23,000
And will marry beautiful English girl

234
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,375
And the invitation
will be on my behalf...

235
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,291
"It's my grandpa's wedding..."

236
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,791
Shut up, Shabnam.

237
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,041
This is the last warning, father.

238
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,083
If you want to stay with us
then you'll have to mend your ways

239
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:39,875
Shaizad, you are my son..

240
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,250
..don't try to be my father.

241
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,541
I am not warning, just cautioning you

242
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,500
If you don't want a foreigner
to be your mother at this age...

243
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,166
...then stop troubling your father

244
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,541
You are right.

245
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:03,750
Shabnam, you also
remember one thing.

246
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,791
Don't always say yes
to whatever your grandpa says.

247
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,791
Respect your parents.

248
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:18,500
I can very well understand
the pain of parents'..

249
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,416
..when children start
disrespecting them.

250
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,708
Would getting annoyed
reap any benefit?

251
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,166
One builds a home
once in a lifetime, son

252
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,458
Also, settle down
in married life once

253
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,875
Mom, you think about
tying me up in a wedlock

254
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,250
Whereas, I plan to live
a free life after my wedding.

255
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,125
I have no objection to it, son.

256
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,250
But your father has, openly,
rejected that teacher's daughter

257
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,499
I can't keep requesting your father,
for this!

258
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,208
What is wrong with Sukhdeep?

259
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,166
She is educated.

260
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,583
Shehas cleared her IELTS,
and is going to Canada

261
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,250
People are ready to pay millions
to marry a girl from Canada

262
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,583
Neither you like the
girl nor her family...

263
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,166
Only because she doesn't
belong to the same caste

264
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,915
On one hand you preach
that our Gurus have taught us...

265
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,166
That everyone is equal irrespective
of their caste, and creed

266
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,583
Sehaj, I had once brought
home some clay to make a peacock.

267
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,166
I kneaded the clay,
brought colours too...

268
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,291
...but I couldn't manage
to turn it into a peacock.

269
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,375
I got tired and started
crying sitting next to...

270
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,208
the scattered clay and coloyrs.

271
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,124
Then your grandma came to me.

272
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,166
She told me that the peacock
shall be made only..

273
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,041
..if you'll be persistent
and passionate to make it...

274
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,125
Then what happened, mother?

275
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,790
Then what?
I succeeded in making the peacock

276
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,500
Okay.

277
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,625
If you want, I shall again
try speaking with your husband

278
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,708
My husband won't give in.

279
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,832
But if you keep trying with determined then
your father, surely, would get convinced.

280
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,250
Okay mother,
but this is the last try.

281
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,125
Come what may,
I am only going to marry Sukhdeep.

282
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,375
I'll talk to father one last time.

283
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,208
If he doesn't agree then
I won't try again.

284
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,583
Here, have some hot bread.

285
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,125
Can I say something?

286
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,750
That teacher's daughter is beautiful.

287
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,291
- And these caste differences...
- Enough!

288
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,790
Don't say another word.

289
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:29,582
I know what's going on here...

290
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,166
If you aren't happy with me, I'll build
a shelter in the field and stay there.

291
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,166
She always keeps talking nonsense.

292
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,791
She always has to go against me.

293
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,166
Don't you dare enter

294
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:05,250
Ranjeet Kaur,
if he comes inside then I will leave.

295
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,708
- Know that.
- Father...

296
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:13,166
Do I need to close the gate
or will you leave on your own?

297
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:18,207
Sehaj Singh,
Sohan Singh is dead for you.

298
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:19,791
He is dead.

299
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,041
Father...

300
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:43,166
Brother, I think you are drunk.

301
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:46,416
Anyway, people from India's
Punjab get drunk quiet easily.

302
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,708
He is not an idiot like you.

303
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,000
This is about something else.

304
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,040
- Today is a Saturday.
- Yes.

305
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,541
I think Saturdays
cast a bad effect on him.

306
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,041
Look at him even I cannot
be too heavy for him.

307
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,458
Let him live in peace.

308
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,750
Why are you making him Pessimistic
about Saturdays and Sunday?

309
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:09,041
- Who does one live for?
- For his family.

310
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,666
What's the point of living
for a family that doesn't respect you?

311
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,207
For yourself.

312
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,500
A person who doesn't respect himself
doesn't get respected by others.

313
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:19,083
Now should I stand before a
mirror and show to my respect myself?

314
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,500
Not a bad idea.

315
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:24,291
By the way brother,
death isn't the solution for this.

316
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,541
We have helped each
other a lot in life.

317
00:23:27,624 --> 00:23:29,749
Now I need your support.

318
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,166
Tell me, should I drown
or eat something which leads to death?

319
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,666
[Laughs] Just eat and drink well.

320
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:38,083
Brother, those who don't eat
well should anyway drown themselves.

321
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,458
I want to die at any cost today.
You both just tell me how!

322
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,833
Listen to me.
Stars are not in your favour.

323
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,500
You should start amending
that from tomorrow.

324
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,875
Now the only way to amend
this is by ending the game.

325
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,541
I was a hero and now I am a zero.

326
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:57,458
Brother, no one is always a hero.

327
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,750
Every individual has an evil side too

328
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,665
One doesn't become
a hero by killing oneself...

329
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,666
...it is rather possible
by killing the ego.

330
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,833
You mean I'm egoistic? I am a villain?

331
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,625
Oh God!

332
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:15,000
Brother, committing suicide is evil

333
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,666
By the way, suicide is a sin.
Your soul won't rest in peace.

334
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,500
It's not like my soul is in peace now.

335
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,625
Leading a gruesome
life is also no virtue

336
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,916
'Maybe this old man,
before he dies, is of some help to me.

337
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,208
What are you thinking about?
Tell me?

338
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,958
Will you support me?

339
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,083
Do you have any suggestions for me?

340
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,291
I have a suggestion.

341
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,750
My suggestion is that
You should have fun...

342
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,208
...Enjoy your life,
see the world and then die.

343
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:49,000
Have you seen Victoria?
Soyes?

344
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,250
Squamish?

345
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,000
We haven't gone out of Surrey
ever since we have come here.

346
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,333
- We did.
- Surrey.

347
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:55,916
We used to go to
pluck berries... remember?

348
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,291
Do we need to tell him that?

349
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:58,750
Go away, kiddo.

350
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,166
I came to suggest on how to die...

351
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,208
...forget saying thanks,
he is instead getting angry.

352
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,125
- Bloody old man. - Don't you dare!
Who did you call an old man?

353
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,291
I'll break your nose.

354
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,833
Don't break my nose,
break your chain of thoughts.

355
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,666
Die! I am not stopping you from dying.

356
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,875
But, I suggest, before dying...
live your life to the fullest

357
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,333
...that when death approaches you...

358
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:19,041
...it says he is the one
who saw heaven before he died.

359
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:23,250
I've visited so many beautiful
places that if I am to die today...

360
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,916
... I won't seek
suggestions like you are.

361
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,250
I would want to die at Banff lake.

362
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:30,541
You'll meet the heavenly angels
even before you jump.

363
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,958
Get out of Surrey.

364
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:36,458
Have fun then go for death.

365
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,625
I like his suggestion.

366
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,041
Leaving home at this
point would be a bad omen

367
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,083
How can we just leave?

368
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,333
Without giving it a thought.

369
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:46,750
Without having the need to travel.

370
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,458
Without informing your family.

371
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,416
You are great. You can
think about committing suicide...

372
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,041
...without there being a need,
without giving it a thought.

373
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,583
And you're having second
thoughts about how to live?

374
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,166
Were you going to inform
your family before committing suicide?

375
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,041
My number is on this card.

376
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,291
Call me if you set your
mood for a trip, I'll take you

377
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:05,083
I'll charge 2500 dollar to guide you,
in addition to other expenses

378
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,666
I'll hire a reasonable
and well maintained car...

379
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,875
With an excellent driver
who is known to me.

380
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,375
If you wish to commit suicide
on the way then you can...

381
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:13,583
Else, when you return to Surrey...

382
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,000
Jump into the river Fraser...

383
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,500
...and I guarantee you
that you won't come out alive.

384
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,375
Either you alone or
all three can jump into it.

385
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,416
No, no, no. He will jump.

386
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,458
See you.

387
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,416
Daddy, why aren't
you answering the call?

388
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:55,625
Hello?

389
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,125
Oh hi.

390
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,000
Sat Shri Akaal

391
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,333
Good, good.
Where?

392
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:03,875
Victoria?
Of course, we will.

393
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,375
Me, Agam and Aswant

394
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,375
Who, mom and dad?

395
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,375
They don't go anywhere.

396
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,333
They hardly make it to the park.

397
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,916
Right. Okay.

398
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,125
Okay, bye.

399
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:20,791
Binder, who told you
we hardly make it to the park?

400
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:24,708
Come on, daddy, Mrs.
Dhillon had called

401
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:27,166
You don't like her husband.

402
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,791
So how can you go out with him?

403
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,625
But you all will also be there.

404
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,750
It's not like I'll travel
while sitting on Dhillon's lap.

405
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,791
Daddy, I hope you don't think that
I don't want to take you along?

406
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:40,583
No, you wanted to take
us to the reception, also, last week.

407
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,416
We are the one who
refused to go there.

408
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,041
Daddy, we were only going
to give the gift and come back.

409
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,708
That's why we didn't
ask you...

410
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,958
I haven't complained about it either.

411
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,750
When you had gone to your
Parents' house for barbeque...

412
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,458
...along with Aswant and Jhanda...

413
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,541
Perhaps we had forgotten to go along

414
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:01,083
You are the one who keeps saying that
you get bored at my parents' house.

415
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,833
I won't go to Victoria,
you go, instead

416
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,374
You shouldn't say such things...

417
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,791
- Jhanda's mummy...
- Number One!

418
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,833
- Jhanda's daddy...
- Number One!

419
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,833
- Grandma and grandpa...
- Amazing!

420
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,791
- Jhanda is at the top...
- Everyone else is down.

421
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,625
- Jhanda is at the top...
- Everyone else is down.

422
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,541
You rule the town,
everyone else is down.

423
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,916
- Jhanda is at the top...
- Everyone else is down.

424
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,125
- Everyone else is down.
- Come on, son.

425
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,916
- Grandma!
- My son is back.

426
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,041
Here you go...

427
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,250
What is this, grandma?

428
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,583
Always keep this with you, son!

429
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:08,541
It'll always protect you against
negative thoughts, and tough phases

430
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,250
- All right?
- Yes, grandma.

431
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:23,708
- Hello?
- Dad, can you pick...

432
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,541
Yes, I have picked up Jhanda.

433
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:28,083
Not Jhanda, dad, Agam.
Please listen to me.

434
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,041
He is Jhanda for me.
Tell me what else can I do for you.

435
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,166
You shouldn't interrupt me, please.

436
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,750
Dad, Binder had called.

437
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:38,083
Please feed Agam some pasta
and ask mom to chop the vegetables.

438
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,791
And you do the laundry.

439
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,166
And yes dad,
don't feed him your leftover.

440
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,791
And also don't interrupt
him every time.

441
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,500
He minds it and it also
affects the child's growth.

442
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,375
Sorry dad, I gotta go. Bye. Bye.

443
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:52,458
Aswant... hello?
Hello?

444
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,749
He asks me to not
feed him my leftovers.

445
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,916
But he doesn't mind
me cleaning their leftovers.

446
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,333
We shouldn't cut in
while they are talking.

447
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,958
But it's all right
to cut vegetables for them.

448
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,916
When I go to pick and drop their
child; it doesn't affect their...

449
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:18,625
What was he saying?

450
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:21,916
Growth.

451
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,708
How do you know that, son?

452
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,458
I know my parents.

453
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
My mother used to say that sharing
each other's food makes love blossom

454
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:56,416
Making me work is a far cry...

455
00:30:56,875 --> 00:31:01,541
My mother didn't even let me even
open a tap, till I was in tenth grade.

456
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:06,791
Neither my father was
a king nor a landlord...

457
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,000
But he treated me like a prince.

458
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:16,665
- By brave boy! - When I stepped
out of my village for the first time...

459
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,208
For my paternal uncle's wedding...

460
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:27,750
My mother had washed my
hands and legs with raw milk.

461
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:36,000
And she gave me a blessing
that I go around the world.

462
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:41,916
May, my son,
go around the whole world!

463
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:49,041
Your son got stuck
in a whirlpool, mother.

464
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:55,957
No one talks to me.

465
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,583
No one talks to me.

466
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:07,541
The story ends when a sandals'
heel and a man's ego is broken.

467
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,958
Father, by deciding
to go on this fun journey...

468
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,666
you have taken a big leap.

469
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:15,000
Whom are you addressing as father?
Address me as sir or mister, son.

470
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,166
Don't try to get close
or build any relations with me

471
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:19,833
He's more short-tempered
as compared to my father.

472
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,082
Anyway, I just need
to use these old men.

473
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,166
Why should I bother?

474
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,375
Sorry, sir. Please forgive me, sir.

475
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:27,833
So much respect?

476
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:31,250
You either say sorry
or seek forgiveness.

477
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,833
How about if I say I love you?

478
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,999
I love you? Who am I, your girlfriend?

479
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,000
Then pack your bags and come quickly.

480
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,416
I am getting ready.

481
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,500
It's 7:45 am.

482
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,333
You shouldn't leave
the house at such a time.

483
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:44,541
Fine, you can come after
the bad time has passed. See you.

484
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,666
Magic, what kind of a person are you?

485
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,791
Your life is coming to an end.

486
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,291
I am telling you that
you don't have much time left.

487
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:54,124
And you are laughing
and saying thank you to me?

488
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,375
Gentleman you know, you are an
intermediary between my life and death.

489
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,916
And the intermediary
doesn't hide anything.

490
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,416
You are unaware how
much these self-proclaimed...

491
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,916
...godmen tend to fool the people...

492
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,250
Yet people worship
and surrender to them

493
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,041
You are telling me the truth.

494
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:11,666
From a distance of three feet,
can't I even thank you?

495
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:15,999
Thank you so much, gentleman.

496
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:19,083
Magic, this is about
your life and death.

497
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:20,916
Your life is short

498
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,250
It doesn't matter how
long or short your life is;

499
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,750
what matters is how you live

500
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:29,750
I'm going to make the most
out this remaining part of my life

501
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,791
That's why I agreed to take this tour.

502
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,125
Why don't you understand?

503
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,000
You shouldn't be working anymore.
You should...

504
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,874
Lie on a bed in your
house and wait for death?

505
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:41,166
Why, is death a relative of mine that
I wait for it, at home, to arrive?

506
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:44,125
I want to lead my life normally...

507
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:47,166
Who knows, death might just walk
past me without even recognising me.

508
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,500
And I get a few more days to live.

509
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,166
That means, you won't listen to me.

510
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:53,583
I'll listen to you.
But tell me one thing.

511
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:56,583
Do you know whether you'll
live to see another day?

512
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,666
- I don't know.
- Then I am lucky.

513
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,375
I, at least,
know I have 10-12 days of life left.

514
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,583
- What you say...
- Magic, try to understand...

515
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:07,625
Wait, wait, wait.
Another gentleman on phone.

516
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,875
Magic...

517
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,875
Hello, gentleman!

518
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:13,041
Leave the gentleman aside,
tell me where are you? Dead or alive?

519
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,791
I am still not dead, my friend.

520
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,416
- Death is on the way.
- What do you mean?

521
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:21,541
Some things become meaningless
when intended to explain.

522
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,165
- I'm coming there.
- Come quickly.

523
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:26,250
Okay, I'll take your leave.

524
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,332
Just keep praying for me...

525
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,875
...that this tour of mine goes well.

526
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,083
Keep... keep calling me, Magic.

527
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:37,541
Doctor, you too keep telling me how
many days and hours are left with me.

528
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,916
I want to live each
equal to a year of my life

529
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:46,750
God, too, should wonder that he was
blessed him with 40 years of lifetime

530
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:49,833
However,
he has lived for a 100 years...

531
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:05,750
'He is embracing his life.'

532
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,791
'While cancer has embraced him.'

533
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:11,666
'But I think his embrace
is much stronger.'

534
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:18,708
I'll check.

535
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,333
Look at this.

536
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,500
Check the other one.

537
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,541
Bye.

538
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,000
Wish you a happy journey.

539
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:50,958
Thank you.

540
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:56,708
Hi guys, grandpa is going on a trip with
his friends for the very first time.

541
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,833
Grandpa, what would you like to say?

542
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,166
What do I say?

543
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,041
You can go on as
many trips as you want.

544
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:05,958
But you shouldn't get
caught in a whirlpool.

545
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,375
I'll recite a poem.

546
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:10,500
Make your character a
strong pillar of your life.

547
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:13,416
Don't give in to the
situation and comprise.

548
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,250
'My dearest,
I never got weekends off.'

549
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:23,875
'So now I am going to spend a few days
with my friends to live as I please.'

550
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,541
'Don't wait for me.'

551
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:29,083
'Maybe we might never meet again.'

552
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,291
'May God be with you.'

553
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,958
'I shall always pray
for your wellbeing.'

554
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,541
'Amar Singh.'

555
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:38,000
'The one who once used
to always do as he pleased.'

556
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:45,791
"Your mysteries are hard understand."

557
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:56,333
"People have turned
You into a business."

558
00:36:57,832 --> 00:37:06,749
"Why do You give us different fates..."

559
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:18,125
"...when we are all
made from the same clay?"

560
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:24,083
"I share my pleas with You, O' Lord."

561
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:30,458
"I share my pain with You, O' Lord."

562
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:36,375
"I share my pleas with You, O' Lord."

563
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:42,750
"I share my pain with You, O' Lord."

564
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:46,375
"Some don't have a place to stay."

565
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:49,375
"Some even give up thrones."

566
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:52,500
"Some stay back because of love."

567
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:55,541
"Some yearn for better days."

568
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:58,833
"Some have a life
filled with happiness."

569
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:02,333
"Some are burdened with sorrows."

570
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:09,124
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

571
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:15,624
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

572
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:21,250
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

573
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:24,708
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

574
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:27,208
Grandpa,
you should keep this with you.

575
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:30,791
It will keep you away from
bad thoughts and bad phases in life.

576
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,500
Do come back.

577
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:47,833
Who told you that I won't come back?

578
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:52,708
Your Jhanda knows everything,
my friend.

579
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:58,791
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

580
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:04,583
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

581
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:10,958
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

582
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:17,375
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

583
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,624
Hello everyone,
gentlemen, please accept my greetings.

584
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,750
My name is Magic.

585
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,750
I don't know why and
who all calls me Magic.

586
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:43,250
But I know a lot about
a lot of special things.

587
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,125
Sehaj is a jack of all trades.

588
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,625
He is a bitter-sweet friend of mine.

589
00:39:46,707 --> 00:39:48,124
Why are you still standing there,
my dear?

590
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,875
Come give me a hug and a kiss.

591
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,791
Do one thing, take each other's
bags and keep it in the car.

592
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,541
We often always carry our own bags.

593
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,541
It is more fun to carry
someone else's bags.

594
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:01,124
So gentlemen,
before you sit in my car...

595
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,541
...let me tell you some of
the ground rules of my car and me.

596
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:06,833
Rule number one,
never cut me up while I am talking.

597
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:10,791
Rule number two, those who
cannot laugh cannot sit in my car.

598
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:16,333
I laughed because I don't
want you to throw me out of my car.

599
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:19,041
Rule number three,
no backbiting and no abuses.

600
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,624
- Rule number four...
- So many rules?

601
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:23,875
I told you about my first rule.
Never cut me up while I am talking.

602
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,208
Rule number four...

603
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:27,291
...with politeness, I can even
sing the verses of Mirza for you

604
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,583
But if you are rude, Then you
won't even get an apology from me.

605
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,583
- Shall we leave now?
- Don't be rude to me.

606
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:33,791
Got it?

607
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,875
Keep the bags in, gentlemen. Let's go.

608
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,583
- Come on, keep them inside.
- Come on, keep them.

609
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:38,791
Keep this one as well.

610
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,958
Hello? Hello?

611
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,541
Hello? You're not audible

612
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:46,750
I am at work.

613
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,500
All right!
So, let's start from Victoria.

614
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,291
- Start driving.
- Whatever you say, my master.

615
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,625
We might reach there somehow...

616
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:00,083
...but looking at the plight of his car
I doubt we'll return safe and sound.

617
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,291
We haven't even left as yet,
gentlemen...

618
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,125
...and you are already
worried about the return?

619
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,625
There is just one
mantra in Magic's life.

620
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:09,666
I live in the present.
Believe in what is there right now.

621
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,375
Neither am I silly nor am I wise

622
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:15,582
Don't die before
you are actually dead.

623
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,208
Say good things, son.

624
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:20,958
Sir, my words don't
make any difference.

625
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,916
The Lord Himself is absolute,
the One and only...

626
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,625
...but He Himself is also
manifested in many forms.

627
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:28,625
Whatever pleases Him,
O Nanak, that alone is good.

628
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,875
Let's talk to PM Trudeau and ask
him to make the days a bit longer.

629
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:43,291
24 hours in a day aren't enough
to live in a place like Canada.

630
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,958
We will ask him to increase
4 to 5 hours at least.

631
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:50,041
The air, water and land
here is so pure. Right?

632
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,833
Air is the Guru, Water is the Father
and Earth is the Great Mother of all.

633
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:57,875
It was our Guru who had said it, but
only the foreigners respected His words.

634
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,458
Hello, gentlemen!

635
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,457
You are standing as if
in the middle of the night...

636
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:54,708
the orders of demonetization
have been passed.

637
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:58,375
Or else people feel this dejected when
their visa for Canada is rejected.

638
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:01,000
You are already in Canada.
You should have some fun.

639
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:04,083
This poor guy can only offer best
wishes and shower some words of love

640
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,750
Would you like to taste some,
gentlemen?

641
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,375
You talk a lot. Don't you get tired?

642
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:11,083
One should keep talking
till God lets you talk.

643
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:14,416
Talk a lot, but say only
things which touch people's heart.

644
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,541
And not something that hurts someone.

645
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:18,333
Where do I turn you off from?

646
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:20,750
Gentleman...

647
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,083
...only God will
turn me off when He wants to.

648
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:29,708
- "No one knows what You will, O' Lord."
- Come on, guys.

649
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:36,333
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

650
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:42,416
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

651
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,916
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

652
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,125
This one is packed.

653
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,000
- Shall we go somewhere else?
- Let's go.

654
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:56,708
Come here, brother.

655
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:00,916
You are leaving, brother?

656
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:03,583
No, I am not leaving.
But I can if you want me to.

657
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:05,624
You look like you are from Malva.
A Malvai?

658
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:07,083
How did you know?

659
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:10,541
Only people like us talk like that.

660
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:12,708
Tell me, what would you like to eat?

661
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,250
We will manage our own orders.

662
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,625
- Thank you for giving us a place to sit.
- Yes.

663
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:21,125
Gentleman, first of all tell us,
why do you look so sad?

664
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,666
Did you end up having
a fight with your wife?

665
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,666
No brother,
Whenever I feel low, I come here.

666
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,666
By the way, I stay close by.

667
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,875
Please give your orders.
What would you like to eat?

668
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:34,375
First order is mine.

669
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:38,541
I want a beautiful smile on your face,
gentleman.

670
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:43,500
Always be high on life.
Ups and downs are a part of it.

671
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:45,583
By the way, my name is Magic.

672
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,875
I don't know why and
who all call me Magic.

673
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:51,083
Because more knowledge more tension.

674
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:53,875
A person can die
but his wants never die.

675
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,208
And why wants don't die? That's
because every person wants that...

676
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:59,833
"This should be mine
and that too should be mine."

677
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:02,208
"That too should be mine."

678
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:05,750
"Why don't you understand
that nothing here belongs to you."

679
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,458
"That nothing here belongs to you."

680
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:11,583
"This should be mine
and that too should be mine."

681
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:15,750
"Why don't you understand
that nothing here belongs to you."

682
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:19,541
"Use whatever you get
and be grateful to Him."

683
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,208
"Use whatever you get
and be grateful to Him."

684
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:28,041
"Why have you made
your life so miserable?"

685
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,958
"Oh my dear, you will cry..."

686
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,916
"When you will have
to spend your life alone."

687
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,625
"Oh my dear, you will cry..."

688
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,290
"When you will have
to spend your life alone."

689
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,666
"Oh my dear, you will cry..."

690
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:57,041
"Life ends but work never ends."

691
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:02,832
"Within a moment the
whole business ends."

692
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:06,250
"Life ends."

693
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:10,041
"You shouldn't be sad,
you should be always happy."

694
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:15,833
"You shouldn't be sad,
you should be always happy."

695
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:18,708
"Who knows how long
you have got to life?"

696
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:20,666
"Oh my dear, you will cry..."

697
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,500
"When you will have
to spend your life alone."

698
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:25,375
"Oh my dear, you will cry..."

699
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,000
"When you will have
to spend your life alone."

700
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:30,125
"Oh my dear, you will cry..."

701
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:41,708
"What will you do with
the money if you are not happy?"

702
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:47,416
"These moments are very precious..."

703
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,375
"Don't waste them on worries."

704
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,958
"You have to cry in
the end so why regret it?"

705
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,416
"You have to cry in
the end so why regret it?"

706
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,291
"When you don't get the
life you had wished for..."

707
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,500
"Oh my dear, you will cry..."

708
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:10,125
"When you will have
to spend your life alone."

709
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:12,625
"When you will have
to spend your life alone."

710
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,583
"Oh my dear, you will cry..."

711
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:34,958
Good morning, lovely guys.
Good morning.

712
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:37,500
I've made strong piping
tea for everyone.

713
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:42,166
As per your instructions, less
milk and more sugar and tea leaves.

714
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,000
Here your tea, Amar uncle.

715
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:47,916
And some biscuits made
from pure clarified butter.

716
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,291
And this is your tea with no sugar,
Mr. Sharma.

717
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:54,166
After a long time I have got
a chance to look after the elderly.

718
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,666
My parents passed away
when I was quite young.

719
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,375
I am a sacrifice to Your creative
power which pervades everywhere

720
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,708
Your limits cannot be known.

721
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:25,333
Mr. Amar Singh,
this is a great location.

722
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:28,750
We are at a good height
and there is a river too.

723
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:30,875
I suggest you go for it.

724
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,416
- Jump down.
- Shut up!

725
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,083
Hello?

726
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,916
I am in Vancouver.
I am driving.

727
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,249
I'll call you when I'll pull over.

728
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,125
Okay.

729
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:47,541
She's after my life.

730
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:51,250
Mr. Jagdeep,
since when are you in Canada?

731
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:53,666
Uncle, I was born and brought up here.

732
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:56,666
- My father was a very religious person.
- Okay.

733
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:59,083
He is the one who
had planted this forest.

734
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:02,291
He came here in 1975
with just 10 dollars.

735
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:03,749
- That's all?
- Yes.

736
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:06,375
- My sister Jaggo and I...
- Breakfast is ready, brother.

737
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:07,416
Come over.

738
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:09,583
Coming, Jaggo. Let's go.

739
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,291
Let's have some breakfast first.

740
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:17,666
Please eat.

741
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,000
Here.

742
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,333
Jaggo.

743
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,083
Nice name, dear.

744
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:28,375
Her name and beauty match her nature.

745
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,833
May God bless her with
all the happiness in the world.

746
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,375
Your sister is very talented, son.

747
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:38,000
Fate is smiling upon her.

748
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:40,625
Fate?

749
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:45,208
My sister is...

750
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:48,250
No, she is now our sister as well.

751
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,916
This is the first time I
am eating such a delicious meal.

752
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,332
I deserve another
stuffed bread, sister.

753
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,541
Hogger.

754
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,833
Like you are sated, gentleman.

755
00:49:57,083 --> 00:50:00,083
I have asked for my third one,
you are already on your forth.

756
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:02,166
Right, sister?
He's just stuffing them in.

757
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,458
You shouldn't count when eating,
brother.

758
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:08,083
Count? He doesn't even chew them.
He just stuffs them in.

759
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:11,000
Careful, brother.

760
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,708
You've just had half a bread.
Don't throw that up as well.

761
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:15,708
Have another one, father.

762
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:19,375
Don't address him as father.
He minds it.

763
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,333
You never know, he might just
stop eating and leave the table.

764
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,375
Shut up. She can say it.

765
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,083
God bless you, dear.

766
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,458
Have a happy married life.

767
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:28,625
May your family be filled
with kids and happiness.

768
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:35,875
Jaggo is two years younger than me.

769
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,916
A year ago...

770
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,958
...in a road accident...

771
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,750
...she lost her husband and her child.

772
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,625
A person's mistake ruined her family.

773
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:59,000
I don't know why I wasn't
with them on that day.

774
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,708
It would have been better
if I too had died that day.

775
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:09,000
Even though I resisted,
brother brought me home with him.

776
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:15,416
And sister-in-law's
family didn't like this.

777
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,790
That's why her parents took her away.

778
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:29,041
She wanted to leave.

779
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,208
But I didn't let her.

780
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,291
In just one moment,
everything came to an end.

781
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,083
No.

782
00:51:40,582 --> 00:51:42,124
No, my brother.

783
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,791
How can everything come to an end
When you are still breathing?

784
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:47,458
Sorrows break the
spirits of an individual.

785
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,250
People break just like things do.

786
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,666
What breaks can be mended and healed.

787
00:51:57,541 --> 00:51:59,250
But to heal oneself after breaking...

788
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,750
...and putting your
life to a better use...

789
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:05,458
...depends on an individual

790
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,291
And this also decides our future.

791
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,250
Brother, it only takes
a moment for a person to break.

792
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:15,791
But sometimes...

793
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:19,916
...even a lifetime
isn't enough to heal.

794
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,791
That day, my husband was coming
back after finalising a property deal.

795
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:37,875
We were planning to
build an orphanage there.

796
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:42,791
Ardaas.

797
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:46,375
A home of God's children.

798
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Never leave your Ardaas
(prayer) incomplete, sister.

799
00:52:55,916 --> 00:53:01,250
Courage, enthusiasm and
curiosity keep the life going.

800
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:08,083
If every sorrow and incident
takes a lot away from us...

801
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:10,416
...then they also give
us something in return.

802
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:15,250
People become anxious,
when something unexpected happens.

803
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,333
This is the way of the world,
O Nanak...

804
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:21,500
...nothing is stable or permanent.

805
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:28,500
Focus on completing
what you two had started, sister.

806
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:40,250
This is great.

807
00:53:40,332 --> 00:53:42,207
You were strangers when we met.

808
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:46,375
But while seeing you off, I
feel as if I am seeing off my family.

809
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:47,791
Dear...

810
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,250
Tears of sorrows get
dried with rays of courage.

811
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:57,916
One, himself, has to perform surgeries
on their problems.

812
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,875
You are right, Lahori uncle.

813
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:03,333
I keep telling Jaggo that
courage is the best healer.

814
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:05,541
My teacher had once told me...

815
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:08,541
...that what happens is
in the control of the Almight.

816
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:10,333
No individual can take charge of it.

817
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,000
You should start
Donating things on Tuesdays.

818
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,750
Mr. Sharma,
you are offering dark glasses...

819
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:17,083
...to the one who wants to
enjoy watching the beauty colours?

820
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:21,541
These inauspicious hours and days are
only for those who worry about them.

821
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,458
- Right?
- Absolutely.

822
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:28,125
Date and day, the Yogi knows not...

823
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:30,041
...the season or month none knows...

824
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:35,833
...the Creator who decorated
the Universe, only He knows.

825
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:40,291
All right gentlemen, congratulate me.

826
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:47,041
From now onwards, I too have a sister.

827
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,666
Life is like a daughter
of happiness and desires.

828
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,708
Life is a friend of hope.

829
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:04,750
That which cannot be
borrowed from any one is life.

830
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,416
You should...

831
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:13,500
Finish what you started, my sister.

832
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:18,000
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

833
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:19,666
Let's go, gentleman.

834
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,416
Keep this with you.

835
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:33,583
It will protect you from negative
thoughts and tough phases in life.

836
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,708
Dear...

837
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,916
Long live life!

838
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,166
Yes.

839
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,875
- See you.
- Goodbye.

840
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:56,333
When Mr. Amar Singh
said 'Long live life'...

841
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:59,708
...it sounded like the British sloganeering
'Long live revolution' with Bhagat Singh.

842
00:56:18,457 --> 00:56:19,999
Hello?
Who is it?

843
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:24,666
Sukhdeep, you?

844
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:28,916
This naughty fellow has saved
your name as Gabbar in his phone

845
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:31,750
He's with me,
here, in the car, sleeping

846
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,541
We are coming from Victoria,
now in Ferry

847
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:38,250
Oh really?

848
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:44,208
Do one thing,
Hang up and wait for Magic's magic.

849
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:18,791
Where have you brought us?

850
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,791
Have you lost your memory or are
you coming here for the first time?

851
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:22,958
It is your own house.

852
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:24,416
Have you lost your mind?

853
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:28,291
Mine is fine,
Need to set someone else's right.

854
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:31,125
You brought me to my
house without even asking me?

855
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,000
- Are you a human or an idiot?
- An idiot.

856
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,416
Because idiots can
do what others cannot do.

857
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:40,541
Come on, boys.

858
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:44,500
Tonight, we are going
to stay with Mrs. And Mr. Sehaj

859
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:45,583
Jadoo.

860
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,666
Mind it. Magic.

861
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,708
Magic.

862
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:52,500
Some things sound better
only when said in English.

863
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:53,833
Get up, guys.

864
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:56,833
Gabbar is there.

865
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:00,666
Let's see what's
in store for you Kalia?

866
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,750
Okay, so I am Gabbar?

867
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:06,125
If I were Gabbar then
I would've chopped off...

868
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:08,041
... your arms like that of Thakur
and would have made you sit at home.

869
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:09,916
Forgive him, Gabbar.

870
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,791
He has been loyal to you

871
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:13,750
Let go of your anger, girl.

872
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,750
He gets infuriated
on trivial issues...

873
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:18,833
As if Mahatma Gandhi offered
you a diploma in peace!

874
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:21,916
We are going to sleep in a while...
You can, then, set him right.

875
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,708
Stop behaving like kids.

876
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,166
The child in you should never die,
Gentleman!

877
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,416
We're capable of forgiving anyone, as
long as we keep the child, in us, alive

878
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,666
Because children never form enmities.

879
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:34,875
They only spread love.
Agreed?

880
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:36,875
Don't you think you preach a lot?

881
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:39,208
Mr. Sharma spoke my heart out aloud.

882
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:42,125
You think the universe
revolves around you?

883
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:44,333
And you are wiser than wisdom?

884
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:47,125
Mr. Sharma,
now you are hurting my weak spot.

885
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:49,458
My neighbour's cat,
took away my wisdom,

886
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,250
as if it was its offspring

887
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,708
Cat? How can a cat take your wisdom?

888
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:56,958
When the stars can take
your fate away, Mr. Sharma...

889
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:00,416
- ...then why can't a cat take away
your wisdom? - Right.

890
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,000
What right?
Why are you wasting time with him?

891
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,333
Come on, let's go to sleep.

892
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,500
You haven't faced
a difficult time as yet.

893
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:10,250
Such people tend to get admitted
in hospital when they get a head ache

894
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,791
This is the reality.

895
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:14,040
Reality?

896
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:18,541
Sometimes, one has to hide realities

897
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:27,166
It is better to ignore the realities
which fades the colors of happiness away

898
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:33,375
On a full moon night,
when you shall come to me...

899
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:36,957
I shall wait
for you with open arms... my life!

900
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:40,250
Those with lack of courage,
won't stand beside you

901
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:44,708
come to me, my life;
I will wel... [coughs]

902
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,208
I love you, life!

903
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,083
Well done, prince.

904
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:54,250
You said something as beautiful
as the morning in Lahore.

905
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:56,750
Whether good or bad ones,
Mr. Khan...

906
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:58,541
One should never refrain
from having conversations

907
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:00,625
A home where people don't talk...

908
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:02,500
...is like a mobile with no network.

909
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:08,041
If you like what I said, let's
end our conversation and go to sleep?

910
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:48,708
Yes, my intermediary?

911
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:49,708
Magic...

912
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:54,041
I had discussed your reports
with my team today.

913
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,708
You don't have much time left,
my friend.

914
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:58,291
Doctor...

915
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:01,375
I don't want to waste
my time thinking about death.

916
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:03,375
I am very happy.

917
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:06,000
You should go to sleep.

918
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,250
Good night.

919
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,416
Magic...Magic, listen to me...

920
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:14,041
What sort of a person is he?

921
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:17,166
Even a slight fever
is enough to scare people...

922
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:19,916
And he is playing around when
his death is right at the threshold

923
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:23,666
Amar Singh?

924
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:26,833
You are thinking about dying now...

925
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:29,666
...whereas I have been
dying since my childhood.

926
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:32,875
Lahori, how have you
been dying since childhood?

927
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,041
Don't ask, sir.

928
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:40,125
In the ninth grade, I was always
dying to fly a kite and have sweets.

929
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:45,000
After that, I was dying to get
my hands on Chaudhary's new Mercedes.

930
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,541
Oh my...

931
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:54,791
Between 16-22 years of age,
Salima, Miriam, Nanjo, Phato, Jamila...

932
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:57,999
And many other beauties I've died for.

933
01:01:58,416 --> 01:02:02,250
After that, I felt that I died
after getting married to my wife.

934
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,458
Then I wondered what have I done.

935
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,083
Then I slogged for my family.

936
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,083
...for my child.

937
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,958
Then Amar Singh, for you...

938
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:12,791
Stop your nonsense, Lahori.

939
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:15,500
Being my friend,
you are making fun of me?

940
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:18,125
Why would I make fun of you, Sardarji?

941
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:19,916
You are my boss.

942
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:24,416
Had my aura been intact,
like that of a boss...

943
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,041
...then why would I decide to die?

944
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:31,875
Committing suicide,
for a Sikh, is criminal and sinful

945
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,875
Right, Pundit?

946
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,750
It's not,
suicide is a boon for Pandits

947
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,291
What chapter is this?

948
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:37,541
Suicide?

949
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,541
What is going on?

950
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:43,750
We are driving down to places in your
car, because... Amar Singh wishes to die.

951
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,541
He was asking suggestions
on how to die.

952
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:46,875
Then we met Sehaj.

953
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:49,500
He said have fun before dying.

954
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:51,666
- He said he has been to a lot of places.
- Sehaj.

955
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:53,416
He has been to a lot of places?

956
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,125
Liar.

957
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:57,833
I sought suggestion because
I considered you as my friends.

958
01:02:58,166 --> 01:03:00,665
But you are acting like
foes and making fun of me.

959
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,458
Say whatever you want to only to him.

960
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:03,833
Why are you dragging me into this?

961
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:05,416
What does he want to die?

962
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:10,291
Sometimes, people are
fed up of their gloomy life.

963
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,541
Unable to get accustomed
to circumstances...

964
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:14,500
...hence decides to take this step.

965
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,250
You are the master
of your circumstances.

966
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:20,375
Either make them or break them...

967
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:36,125
"Some are seeking something."

968
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:39,458
"Some wish to give it all away."

969
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:45,291
"Some are seeking something."

970
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:48,291
"Some wish to give it all away."

971
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:51,375
"Some plant petals on your path."

972
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:54,416
"Some want to remove the thorns."

973
01:03:54,833 --> 01:04:01,958
"Everyone thinks differently."

974
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:07,541
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

975
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:14,125
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

976
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:19,250
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

977
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:26,290
"No one knows what You will, O' Lord."

978
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,208
Who did you ask before
Bringing Sukhdeep her along?

979
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:34,791
I asked Sukhdeep.

980
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,583
I begged her to come along.

981
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:41,500
Look, one tend to be more careful
when a woman travelling along...

982
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:47,250
By the way, why do have
a wrecked expression on your face?

983
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,708
Smile please.

984
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:56,583
Distances seem to get
shorter with just one smile...

985
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,541
And a person who always frowns...

986
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,916
...find the distance between
his bed and the washroom...

987
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,750
...to be as far as
Delhi is from Lahore.

988
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:08,333
They think it is better to die than
to go to the washroom with such mood.

989
01:05:08,416 --> 01:05:09,875
Whom is this targeted at?

990
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:12,541
I sometimes like to preach myself.

991
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:15,125
I live in the present.
believe in what is right now.

992
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:17,791
I consider myself
neither stupid nor smart.

993
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:20,583
Don't die before
you are actually dead.

994
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,000
Hope you didn't feel
that this was intended at you?

995
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,333
Your behavior is childlike.

996
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:28,666
Where when one is injected,
the other screams

997
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:30,416
So I scream, right?

998
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,375
Pullover, my prince.

999
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:34,666
Look at this beautiful view of nature

1000
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,750
Look at it, it's wonderful!

1001
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,749
Stop the car.

1002
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,625
Can't you hear me? Are you deaf?

1003
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:43,875
I'll stop.

1004
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:46,875
This isn't your Lahore
that I can stop anywhere.

1005
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,583
I'll stop at a wider
road after this hairpin bend.

1006
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,250
Okay.

1007
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:15,333
Wonderful!

1008
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,541
The wind,
like, drenched in a mother's love

1009
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,583
...is embracing us

1010
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:33,916
And the sky is looking like father

1011
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:40,458
It is so calm,
peaceful and serene here.

1012
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:43,500
praying at such a place...

1013
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:48,000
...chanting your mantra
Shall make one free of all problems

1014
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:52,000
Mr. Sharma, it is freezing here... that
you won't survive till evening even

1015
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:54,625
Hence, all problems will,
permanently, come to an end

1016
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:58,957
Come on, let me click
a picture of all of you.

1017
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:01,333
- Yes, come on.
- Smile. - Come on.

1018
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:05,541
Okay. One more.

1019
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:08,291
Nice.

1020
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:44,541
One more.

1021
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,333
Nice photo.

1022
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:48,166
Your phone!

1023
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:50,166
Keep it, I don't need it.

1024
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,458
Oh no!
Sehaj! Sehaj!

1025
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:00,958
- Amar Singh!
- Mr. Amar Singh!

1026
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:03,708
- What are you doing?
- Mr. Amar Singh!

1027
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:05,208
- Amar Singh!
- Wait.

1028
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:06,791
Don't come near me...

1029
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,000
It is a very beautiful place.

1030
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:10,875
My time has come.

1031
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:11,750
Mr. Amar Singh...

1032
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:13,833
Please forgive me if
I've hurt you in any way.

1033
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:15,458
Continue with your tour.

1034
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:16,957
You are getting a call.

1035
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:19,708
Whoever it is,
tell him that everything is over.

1036
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:21,124
It is some Jhanda's call.

1037
01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:25,958
Jhanda's call?

1038
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:29,500
Here.

1039
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:32,750
Hello?

1040
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:34,833
Buddy...

1041
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:37,333
How are you?

1042
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:38,583
I am good.

1043
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:41,000
But I had a bad dream.

1044
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,083
You are dreaming at daytime?

1045
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:45,375
Now I go to sleep after
coming back from school.

1046
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,875
It's not like you are at
home that I can play with you.

1047
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:53,250
I dreamt that you
met with an accident.

1048
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:56,083
Grandpa, it was like...like...

1049
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:59,208
No, don't cry, my boy.

1050
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:03,916
Like you died.

1051
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,958
No, I am absolutely fine.

1052
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:08,875
We are sitting in a restaurant.

1053
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,208
We are having a lot of fun, son.

1054
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:11,916
You are lying.

1055
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:15,791
No, wait, talk to the waiter.

1056
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:18,500
- Hold him.
- I am fine.

1057
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:20,166
Jhanda!

1058
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,416
How do I explain to Jhanda that I am...

1059
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:46,666
Daan, will you two
be able to explain Jhanda?

1060
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:49,666
Meaning, you are determined
to commit the mistake

1061
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:52,500
which you attempted a while ago?

1062
01:09:53,291 --> 01:09:56,125
Gentleman, people who keep
repeating their mistakes...

1063
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:58,875
...starts living a life
full of disappointments.

1064
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,625
Ask people whose days are numbered

1065
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:08,833
... the value of life.

1066
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,958
Oh my mind, you are the
embodiment of the Divine Light...

1067
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:16,208
Recognise your own origin.

1068
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:19,416
Oh my mind, the Dear Lord is with you...

1069
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:21,708
...through the Guru's teaching,
enjoy His love.

1070
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:25,000
Sardar, you are like the sun.

1071
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:25,916
Yes.

1072
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:31,666
Brother?

1073
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,125
Brother!

1074
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:42,208
I am not the sun, I am darkness.

1075
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:44,791
And darkness is not good.

1076
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,625
The sun rises from darkness.

1077
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,833
What have you gotten yourself into?

1078
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,666
It's a vacation,
enjoy yourself.

1079
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:53,541
I want to leave this world!

1080
01:10:54,583 --> 01:11:00,041
When I, a six feet tall man,
Look at myself in the mirror...

1081
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:03,041
...I see myself as a dwarf.

1082
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:08,000
I have become a puppet for my kids.

1083
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:11,958
I won't be able to survive with
this baggage of their favours onto me

1084
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:15,666
I cannot stay imprisoned
in my own house.

1085
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,250
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

1086
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,708
Brother, have you seen him anywhere?

1087
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:22,333
No, brother.

1088
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:23,708
Let us know if you see him anywhere.

1089
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:24,958
His name is Karam Singh.

1090
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:26,708
- We've mentioned the phone
number below. - Okay.

1091
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:32,291
I want to live like a human being.

1092
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:34,083
And not as a pet animal.

1093
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:37,583
Sardarji, man is a social animal.

1094
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:38,916
That means an animal.

1095
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,541
And there are two kinds of animals.

1096
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,083
Tamed and untamed

1097
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:43,833
What kind of an animal you want to be...

1098
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:45,625
...it is completely up to you.

1099
01:11:45,916 --> 01:11:48,291
By the way,
it is tough to be an animal.

1100
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:52,708
You need to have a heart full of love
and 100 percent dedication.

1101
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:59,333
"This world is a complicated place."

1102
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:07,833
"You should think
before you take a step."

1103
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:14,125
"You will earn love."

1104
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,583
"You should always accept
everything with a smile."

1105
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,750
"Keep your heart open."

1106
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:34,958
"And always accept the truth."

1107
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:45,666
"Water never questions you."

1108
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:51,666
"They never you for
your caste or creed."

1109
01:12:52,458 --> 01:13:00,250
"Tears of regret will fill your eyes."

1110
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:03,833
"Oh Man..."

1111
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:11,541
"Oh Man, the decisions
shall be made at His place."

1112
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:22,583
Build such relations, with people,
in this world, o fakira

1113
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:25,291
That people laugh when you laugh...

1114
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:26,750
And cry when you cry

1115
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:31,916
Always be ready to get
humiliated by your children.

1116
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,250
They think this old man is selfish

1117
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:36,333
He doesn't think about anyone else.

1118
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:37,958
I am not angry.

1119
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:40,875
It's just you are not happy
with me and I am not happy with you.

1120
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:41,666
Simple.

1121
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,291
I am not happy with you?

1122
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,958
Introspect, for once, honestly...

1123
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:55,750
I face humiliation while praying for my daughter
and son-in-law be blessed with a child

1124
01:13:57,458 --> 01:14:00,291
Children these days are impossible.

1125
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:02,541
And people think about dying for them.

1126
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:06,791
So why can't we think about
living for your children instead?

1127
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:10,541
And if you feel like a servant While doing
the household chores in your own homes

1128
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:12,415
...then all of us are servants.

1129
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:15,666
Getting to play with your
grandchildren picking them up...

1130
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,291
...and dropping them off to school...

1131
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:19,041
Is a chance which only
the fortunate ones get...

1132
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:20,125
Right?

1133
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,208
It's okay.

1134
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,041
You'll understand this

1135
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,375
when you'll be at
this stage of your life

1136
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,582
A child is like a
crop nurtured with love

1137
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,041
It needs to be showered
with water of wisdom

1138
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,416
This is just 100% generation
gap and nothing else.

1139
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,208
It's just that times have changed.

1140
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:36,625
Son...

1141
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:40,416
These children are surely ungrateful.

1142
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:43,416
A person agrees to everything
That his child says.

1143
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:44,791
But does that child listen to you?

1144
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:46,833
listen to you?
They make you do what they want.

1145
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,208
They order you.

1146
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:49,916
They consider themselves as perfect

1147
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,666
Gentlemen, you must have also considered
yourselves as perfect at some point of time

1148
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,708
And I think you all still do

1149
01:14:55,750 --> 01:15:00,083
Try and retrospect, how much
did you respected your parents' words?

1150
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:01,708
Did you ever follow
the path they had shown?

1151
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:03,541
Did you ever stop
when they wanted you to?

1152
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:09,791
Gentlemen, if a book gets old,
the story inside never changes.

1153
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,833
Take a trip down the memory
lane someday, and relive your past

1154
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:23,666
You will remember a lot of things.

1155
01:15:33,666 --> 01:15:36,375
Don't stop me, mother.
I cannot stay here anymore.

1156
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:40,125
Please don't, son. Don't be so stubborn.

1157
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:43,583
What will you gain by going abroad?

1158
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:45,583
What are you lacking over here?

1159
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,083
What do I have here, mother?

1160
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:50,083
Your youth will get ruined in Canada.

1161
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:52,708
I'll have a better life, mother.

1162
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:57,500
You, just, tell
father to give me my passport.

1163
01:15:57,833 --> 01:15:58,666
Son...

1164
01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:02,250
At least think about us.

1165
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:04,291
Then when will I think about myself?

1166
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:06,541
You have spent your
life struggling here.

1167
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:10,083
I won't be able to do that.

1168
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:11,750
Amar...

1169
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:15,125
What is it that we didn't give you?

1170
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:17,500
Why are you wasting your energy?

1171
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,000
Here's your passport!

1172
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:21,625
Take it and get lost!

1173
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:24,958
But remember one thing...

1174
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,958
If you pick this up...

1175
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:36,000
Then you won't lend your shoulder
to carry the bier of our mortal remains

1176
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:29,458
God bless you, son.

1177
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:43,791
Enough, that's enough.
That's enough, Mr. Amar Singh.

1178
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:47,375
I bowed my head before
my mother just once...

1179
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:52,083
...and I could hear her blessings
till the end of the lane.

1180
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,707
But I could never hear her sighs.

1181
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:03,541
I cannot live anymore.
I have lost.

1182
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:11,458
Gentleman, One becomes
successful by beating the failure

1183
01:18:11,541 --> 01:18:15,708
No, I cannot live anymore.
I made my parents cry a lot.

1184
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,333
Let me die!

1185
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:18,875
You are impossible to understand.

1186
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:21,291
Sometimes you say you want to
die because your children make you cry.

1187
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:23,708
Today you say that you want to
die because you made your parents cry.

1188
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,541
Clearly tell, before dying, why you
want to die?

1189
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:29,583
Mr. Sharma,
how about you laugh a little as well?

1190
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:33,333
When you plant flowers,
but all you get is thorns

1191
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:35,625
Then it becomes impossible to laugh

1192
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:38,416
Crying won't turn the thorns
into flowers either, sir.

1193
01:18:39,541 --> 01:18:42,666
You'll understand my pain
when your son...

1194
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:46,083
...and daughter-in-law will make
you go through the same.

1195
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:52,958
This Sardarji keeps reciting a Shabad.

1196
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:56,541
I thought that I was in trouble...

1197
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:58,916
...the whole world is in trouble!

1198
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:01,458
When I climbed up the
roof and looked around...

1199
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:03,583
...I saw this fire
in each and every home.

1200
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:06,708
I think you forgot this Shabad.

1201
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:09,916
Like you have never heard it.

1202
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:14,000
But I have learnt a lesson from it.

1203
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:17,708
Look...

1204
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:22,041
There are problems in my life too

1205
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:27,708
But I've never let you know of it

1206
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:32,458
I've felt this burn many times

1207
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:35,291
But I keep subsiding
it with jokes and laughter

1208
01:19:36,124 --> 01:19:37,499
And I keep smiling.

1209
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,458
But I never thought
about committing suicide

1210
01:19:42,666 --> 01:19:44,500
You must have killed your pride.

1211
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:45,958
I cannot kill it.

1212
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:50,416
Gentleman, this is called
killing the ego and not the pride.

1213
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:52,125
Don't exaggerate the matter, you fool.

1214
01:19:52,249 --> 01:19:54,582
I am not as shrewd as you...

1215
01:20:01,416 --> 01:20:05,583
You didn't tell me the agenda
behind this tour before we left.

1216
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:09,250
Just like the car's hire
price inflates during weddings

1217
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:10,833
...I too will charge higher.

1218
01:20:11,666 --> 01:20:14,458
This Sikh man,
too, is all set to tie a knot with death

1219
01:20:14,666 --> 01:20:15,958
Uncle, talk to him.

1220
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:17,666
Don't call me uncle!

1221
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:19,625
You are difficult to understand.

1222
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:22,041
You get irritated if I call you father.
You get irritated if I call you uncle.

1223
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:23,541
Shall I address you as Bholu Kaka?

1224
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:35,958
- Aswant?
- Yes?

1225
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:38,208
I have been calling dad for a long time

1226
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,875
He keeps disconnecting my calls.

1227
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:41,875
I don't know why he is disconnecting it.

1228
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,958
What state must he be in?

1229
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:45,833
You should have cared about him earlier

1230
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:48,708
Shut up.

1231
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:50,833
Take my name and leave a message.

1232
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:52,333
Say that Jhanda wants to talk to him.

1233
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:53,625
Your name is Agamjot.

1234
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:56,250
Okay, fine.
I had called him, secretly

1235
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:57,375
From our landline.

1236
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:59,625
It is saved as Jhanda in his phone.

1237
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:01,541
Call him. He will answer it.

1238
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:05,666
That means I hold no value.

1239
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:09,208
I am so worried for him over here.

1240
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:14,666
Fine, will you call him using my phone?

1241
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:21,083
Kiddo, next summer,
we both will come on this tour together.

1242
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:22,916
So sweet of you, grandpa.

1243
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:26,291
Next time not just the two of us,
But the three of us will go there.

1244
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:29,750
You should find yourself
a beautiful old white woman.

1245
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:31,291
To be my grandma.

1246
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:32,291
Old?

1247
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:33,666
Oh God!

1248
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,541
Now my daughter Shabnam
too will underestimate me?

1249
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:38,750
I am still not dead.
Why are you troubling me?

1250
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,375
Sorry buddy, I was missing you.

1251
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:43,708
Oh Jhanda, you?

1252
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:46,416
I too miss you a lot, buddy.

1253
01:21:46,791 --> 01:21:47,666
You are lying.

1254
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,583
Why didn't you call
me if you were missing me?

1255
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:52,416
Forgive me, I made a mistake.

1256
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:56,666
I accept any punishment for it,
my master.

1257
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,457
- [Saza]?
- Oh Punishment.

1258
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:01,791
Oh, no punishment.

1259
01:22:05,916 --> 01:22:07,541
I love you, buddy.

1260
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,041
Love you too.

1261
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:12,665
Love you...

1262
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:14,291
I love you, grandpa.

1263
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:16,291
A lot.

1264
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:22,875
I love you, my children.

1265
01:22:56,458 --> 01:22:59,291
[praying]

1266
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,332
[praying]

1267
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:10,041
Lahori!

1268
01:23:10,416 --> 01:23:11,333
What sort of irrational
behavior is this?

1269
01:23:11,415 --> 01:23:15,040
Mr. Sharma, this is called
an affectionate battering our Lahore.

1270
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:16,708
You anyway, are a vegan

1271
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:18,916
And a very fussy eater.

1272
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:21,333
You are making fun
of my religious beliefs.

1273
01:23:21,582 --> 01:23:24,332
Oh Good God, such a grave accusation?

1274
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:25,208
Here, eat it.

1275
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:26,625
- Now I don't want to eat it.
- Why?

1276
01:23:26,666 --> 01:23:30,208
You can make a Muslim
your friend and hug him...

1277
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:31,916
...but you cannot eat something
he's already taken a bite from?

1278
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,666
Come on, you can take mine.

1279
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:35,125
It is vegetarian and
I haven't had it as yet. Here.

1280
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:36,208
It's not about that.

1281
01:23:36,291 --> 01:23:40,583
Mr. Sharma,
this is a result of your superstitions.

1282
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:41,833
I was just kidding.

1283
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,416
Lahori, I don't like jokes.

1284
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:45,874
I'll thrash you!

1285
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:49,375
Come on out Jeona Morh of Moud Mandi!

1286
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:51,833
- I'll end him!
- You... - Hey!

1287
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:53,832
Daan!
Ratan!

1288
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:56,041
You'll see me dead if you
blow this out of proportion.

1289
01:23:56,125 --> 01:24:00,625
We are anyway going to see
you dead as you have decided to die.

1290
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:01,999
But about him...

1291
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:04,375
Hats off to you!

1292
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:07,500
For a moment you two were
scared of father's threat!

1293
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,208
Sorry, I just said it without thinking

1294
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:11,583
- without thinking?
- Yes.

1295
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,708
It's okay, you can call me that.

1296
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:16,041
Live long, gentleman.

1297
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:19,291
Seeing you all laughing and fighting
like this reminded me of my childhood.

1298
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:21,291
Nothing can be compared to the
fun we used to have in our childhood.

1299
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:22,541
Well said.

1300
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:23,666
This girl is right.

1301
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:27,000
Nothing can be compared to
the fun we had in the childhood.

1302
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:30,250
This songs suits me better, I think.

1303
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:32,750
- It's not like we are divided.
- Why not?

1304
01:24:32,916 --> 01:24:34,833
The countries are divided.
And so are its people.

1305
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:36,750
But our songs are not divided.

1306
01:24:36,958 --> 01:24:38,583
The love isn't divided.

1307
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:40,000
Our hearts aren't divided.

1308
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,000
"Kotla Chapaki, it's Thursday today."

1309
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:50,125
"The one who looks here and there,
shall be punished."

1310
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:54,500
"Marbles, tying the monkey,
hitting the ball with a stick..."

1311
01:24:54,583 --> 01:24:58,291
"We spent a good time
playing hide and seek."

1312
01:24:58,375 --> 01:25:02,416
"Marbles, tying the monkey,
hitting the ball with a stick..."

1313
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:06,125
"We spent a good time
playing hide and seek."

1314
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:12,458
"We have a lot of fun in the pond."

1315
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:18,291
"Nothing can be compared
to the fun we had in the childhood."

1316
01:25:18,375 --> 01:25:26,666
"Nothing can be compared
to the fun we had in the childhood."

1317
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:38,041
"I won't able to forget the
free snacks taken from the store."

1318
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:41,875
"No longer will the
ink leak while writing."

1319
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:46,041
"I won't able to forget the
free snacks taken from the store."

1320
01:25:46,124 --> 01:25:49,749
"No longer will the
ink leak while writing."

1321
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:55,958
"I used to pluck a flower
every day from the garden!"

1322
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:01,875
"Nothing can be compared
to the fun we had in the childhood."

1323
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:05,833
"Nothing can be compared
to the fun we had in the childhood."

1324
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:09,833
"Nothing can be compared
to the fun we had in the childhood."

1325
01:26:09,916 --> 01:26:13,333
"Kotla Chapaki, it's Thursday today."

1326
01:26:13,416 --> 01:26:17,125
"The one who looks here and there,
shall be punished."

1327
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:21,083
"Kotla Chapaki, it's Thursday today."

1328
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:25,666
"The one who looks here and there,
shall be punished."

1329
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:29,583
Wonderful!

1330
01:26:34,708 --> 01:26:36,666
Mr. Karam Singh?

1331
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:39,000
- Sehaj!
- Yes?

1332
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:40,458
- Sehaj!
- How?

1333
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,000
The lost man.

1334
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,416
The missing person
pamphlet that you have.

1335
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,583
Yes?

1336
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:46,958
Stop, brother.

1337
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:48,791
Wait here, we'll go after him.

1338
01:26:49,541 --> 01:26:50,541
Wait!

1339
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:53,333
Where do you want to run and go?

1340
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:55,166
Wait and listen to us.

1341
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,708
Stop, brother.

1342
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:19,583
Stop...

1343
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,041
What is this, Magic?

1344
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:41,416
How easily did you say that
the cancer is spreading in you.

1345
01:27:41,666 --> 01:27:43,416
And that any moment... you...

1346
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:46,250
Couldn't you have told me?

1347
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:48,125
Come with me to Surrey right away!

1348
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:51,333
I thought you are my friend.

1349
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,125
But you are my enemy.

1350
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:55,083
I am your enemy?

1351
01:27:57,625 --> 01:27:59,708
To the one
who can live for hours...

1352
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,125
You're telling to die within seconds.

1353
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:04,208
Sehaj...

1354
01:28:05,708 --> 01:28:08,583
This disease has been
with me since past 4 years.

1355
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:11,708
And since many years I know...

1356
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:14,208
...that I don't have
a enough time left with me.

1357
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,000
That's why I didn't get married.

1358
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:23,666
My dearest friend,
forget about what I've told you

1359
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:25,875
You don't know anything.

1360
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:28,666
Like you were unaware
until a few moments ago.

1361
01:28:29,666 --> 01:28:31,000
Yes.

1362
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:33,750
If you can do something, then do this

1363
01:28:35,666 --> 01:28:37,375
Give me a tight hug.

1364
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:42,666
Come on give me a hug!

1365
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:44,791
Later you are only going
to get to hug my dead body!

1366
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,541
"Where did you go, gentleman?"

1367
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:52,500
"Oh Magic..."

1368
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:55,000
"Magic..."

1369
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:58,125
I got a call.

1370
01:28:58,458 --> 01:28:59,666
A moment please.

1371
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:01,125
Wait.

1372
01:29:01,666 --> 01:29:03,125
Hey Mr. Middle Man?

1373
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:06,000
Magic, tell me, are you alright?

1374
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:09,666
I could answer the call
only because I am fine.

1375
01:29:10,708 --> 01:29:13,125
But I think the day of
my Big day is nearing.

1376
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,666
The quantity of blood
in my cough has increased.

1377
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,791
Magic, your time is coming to an end,
my brother.

1378
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:22,666
God is in a hurry, I guess.

1379
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:25,333
Doctor, honestly speaking...

1380
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:29,083
...I don't feel like leaving.

1381
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:32,750
Magic, you don't have a few days left...

1382
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:36,750
...now you have only a few hours
left to live. So please, brother...

1383
01:29:37,833 --> 01:29:40,000
You mean I'll be married
Before my birthday?

1384
01:29:41,666 --> 01:29:43,416
Game over.

1385
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:49,291
I wanted to celebrate my
40th birthday before my wedding.

1386
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:50,874
Anyways...

1387
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,708
Take care, doctor.

1388
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:55,375
Bye-bye.

1389
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,500
Shabnam!

1390
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:20,541
Shabnam!

1391
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,458
What is wrong with you?

1392
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:23,916
Have you gone crazy?

1393
01:30:25,375 --> 01:30:29,416
Good, at least to talked to me.

1394
01:30:31,416 --> 01:30:33,750
Otherwise,
since the time grandpa has left...

1395
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:37,333
...I feel as if this
house is no longer alive.

1396
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:39,333
Shut up! Mind your language.

1397
01:30:46,416 --> 01:30:47,625
Laal...

1398
01:30:48,332 --> 01:30:49,957
You should call papa.

1399
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,750
He didn't take his phone with him.

1400
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:54,708
He knows no one is going to call him.

1401
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:10,916
Grandpa!

1402
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:42,750
Mr. Amar Singh!

1403
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:45,000
Amar Singh!

1404
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,833
Mr. Amar Singh!

1405
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:52,250
Amar Singh!

1406
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:55,666
Mr. Amar Singh!

1407
01:31:57,458 --> 01:31:58,750
Amar Singh!

1408
01:31:59,208 --> 01:32:00,791
Mr. Amar Singh!

1409
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:04,250
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

1410
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:06,208
- Amar Singh!
- Amar Singh!

1411
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:09,166
- Where the hell are you?
- Amar Singh!

1412
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:10,500
Mr. Amar Singh!

1413
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:13,958
Over there.

1414
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:14,916
Come on.

1415
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:18,666
Mr. Amar Singh!

1416
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:21,041
Uncle!

1417
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:22,833
Uncle!

1418
01:32:25,666 --> 01:32:28,958
I think... Mr. Amar Singh
has done what he had intended.

1419
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:30,208
Hey...

1420
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:34,875
You should be adamant to live.

1421
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:39,041
I live every day
like it's a celebration.

1422
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:42,375
Every morning a new life begins.

1423
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:46,541
You need to live by killing your ego...

1424
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:49,666
...and understanding
other people's need.

1425
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:56,208
Sardarji did get a chance to
look at life from a new prospective.

1426
01:32:56,291 --> 01:33:02,083
I thought Sehaj showed
up like an angel at the shore...

1427
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:03,833
...and his death got pushed away.

1428
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:09,124
No, I didn't show up as an angel.

1429
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:13,125
I showed up with evil intentions.

1430
01:33:13,791 --> 01:33:19,208
I was sitting at the beach
thinking of ways to make a quick buck.

1431
01:33:20,666 --> 01:33:22,875
And how do I get away from Sukhdeep.

1432
01:33:26,208 --> 01:33:27,250
What?

1433
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:29,583
Yes.

1434
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:34,125
That you when we fought...

1435
01:33:35,291 --> 01:33:37,666
I too am made of flesh and bones.
I am not a machine.

1436
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:39,458
I too am a human being
and not a video game...

1437
01:33:39,541 --> 01:33:41,125
...which you control.

1438
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:45,416
Had you been someone whom I could control
then you wouldn't have been idle...

1439
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,750
...that too in Canada!

1440
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I'm not fond of sitting idle.

1441
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:50,750
I cannot tolerate anyone bossing me.

1442
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:51,875
That's why I left those jobs.

1443
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:54,083
I was going to drive
a taxi but it didn't work out.

1444
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:57,374
I had thought I'd go to Canada,
have lots of fun and enjoy life.

1445
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,916
How can you think about not working...

1446
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,416
And still enjoy, Sehaj?

1447
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,750
You had told me that life
in Canada is very beautiful.

1448
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:05,250
You can do what you think of.

1449
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:06,541
I'm still firm on it

1450
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:08,124
But mere thinking about it won't help.

1451
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:10,083
Think about working
and progressing

1452
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:11,499
...and only then will
your dreams come true.

1453
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:12,666
- Without working...
- Stop it.

1454
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,958
You will see when one of
my schemes work.

1455
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:16,500
I will have my own business.

1456
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,125
I will hire white men and women.

1457
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:20,875
You have to mend your ways
to get a job and a social life.

1458
01:34:20,958 --> 01:34:22,374
Stop making schemes.

1459
01:34:22,666 --> 01:34:24,375
Jobs are for people like you.

1460
01:34:24,541 --> 01:34:26,000
I will do business.

1461
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:28,208
I will roam around
Canada and earn dollars.

1462
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,666
What do you think, you'll be able to
do a business by mere talking about it?

1463
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:33,958
Not by talking, by scheming.

1464
01:34:34,333 --> 01:34:36,125
This attitude of yours
is what stops you from working.

1465
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:38,666
You know I also work for 11 hours.

1466
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:40,583
You are not doing anyone any favour.

1467
01:34:40,666 --> 01:34:43,208
Yes, I am not doing any favours but
at least I am not a burden on someone.

1468
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:45,791
Oh I see. So I am a burden.

1469
01:34:46,041 --> 01:34:46,833
Yes.

1470
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,374
You are a burden.

1471
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:51,666
Then I'll unburden you today itself.

1472
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:54,208
Sehaj!

1473
01:34:54,291 --> 01:34:55,791
Sehaj! Sehaj!

1474
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,083
I've never gone anywhere.

1475
01:34:59,416 --> 01:35:02,833
Ever since, I've come to Canada,
I never stepped out of Surrey.

1476
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:05,208
So, you planned to fool use.

1477
01:35:05,875 --> 01:35:08,291
I was just trying
to get what I want.

1478
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,332
Made this decision by mistake.

1479
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:11,708
Mister...

1480
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:15,916
Our friend didn't decide to die on a whim.

1481
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:19,208
Sir, who are we to
decide upon our death?

1482
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:22,291
Can we decide when should we be born?

1483
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:25,500
You know a lot about birth and death.

1484
01:35:26,708 --> 01:35:29,000
Brother, if we could choose
where you we could be born...

1485
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:31,375
...I would have been born
to the Queen of England.

1486
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
If one cannot make
a choice about their birth...

1487
01:35:34,083 --> 01:35:36,333
...then why make
a choice about when to die?

1488
01:35:36,583 --> 01:35:40,208
- Because many time, one cannot
live as they wish to. - Uncle!

1489
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:43,416
Where were you?

1490
01:35:44,833 --> 01:35:46,916
Earlier I had to inform
my parents before I used to go...

1491
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:49,000
Then my wife.

1492
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:50,833
Then my children.

1493
01:35:51,666 --> 01:35:53,583
Now, do I have to inform you all too
before going anywhere?

1494
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,625
You sometimes feel
like meeting yourself.

1495
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:01,291
I was here only.

1496
01:36:01,708 --> 01:36:02,875
In the forest.

1497
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:07,666
After I leave you all to Surrey,
I'll come back here to die.

1498
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,500
Why do you say such things, sir?

1499
01:36:09,583 --> 01:36:11,125
I'm not strong at heart.

1500
01:36:11,208 --> 01:36:13,125
I'm a Pigeon-hearted person

1501
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:16,916
If my heart fails,
our travel game will end right here.

1502
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:21,041
Look at them laughing.

1503
01:36:21,416 --> 01:36:25,250
Look, if something happens to me,
don't cremate me.

1504
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,832
I have donated my body.

1505
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:29,583
You anyway become
dust after you die.

1506
01:36:29,666 --> 01:36:31,833
So why not be of help to someone even
after you die! What more can one ask for

1507
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:33,833
They will perform a few experiments.

1508
01:36:33,916 --> 01:36:35,208
What else?

1509
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:37,833
Well, I shouldn't stray
from the truth before I die.

1510
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:40,500
And Guru's Bani is the truth.

1511
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,291
True Lord always supports the truth.

1512
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:47,916
My mother used to say these words.

1513
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:51,375
People who forget what their
mothers and Gurus have said...

1514
01:36:52,166 --> 01:36:53,791
...they forget how to live.

1515
01:36:54,791 --> 01:36:56,875
Magic wouldn't be your
real name, son, I'm sure!

1516
01:36:57,166 --> 01:36:58,750
Tell me your real name.

1517
01:36:58,833 --> 01:37:00,083
Let me make your horoscope.

1518
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:03,208
Also tell me your date
and place of birth.

1519
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,166
[Laughs] Place of Birth?

1520
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:08,166
Sir, I don't even
know who my parents are.

1521
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:11,583
I lived in an orphanage
in India till I was nine.

1522
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:13,708
They used to call
me Jadoo over there.

1523
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,833
Mr. Dreamer adopted
me and brought me here.

1524
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:19,125
And here everyone
started calling me Magic.

1525
01:37:19,791 --> 01:37:21,750
Mr. Dreamer used
to call me Magic...

1526
01:37:21,833 --> 01:37:23,625
...and I used to call
him Mr. Dreamer.

1527
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:26,708
Mr. Dreamer didn't cut my hair...

1528
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:29,875
...so I suffixed 'Singh' with my name.

1529
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:31,708
Magic Singh.

1530
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:37,666
Mr. Dreamer passed away and
Gave me this truck as a remembrance

1531
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,958
I love you, Mr. Dreamer.

1532
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:45,958
Shabnam?

1533
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:48,166
Shabnam, my child.

1534
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:50,708
Shab...

1535
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,957
Shabnam?

1536
01:37:55,833 --> 01:37:56,958
You are sitting all alone here.

1537
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:01,875
I know you are missing your grandpa.

1538
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:15,665
Don't you miss him?

1539
01:38:15,833 --> 01:38:17,583
I miss him a lot, my dear.

1540
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,083
No...

1541
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:22,708
Mummy, grandfather is here.

1542
01:38:22,791 --> 01:38:24,208
Did brother or
sister-in-law say something?

1543
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:25,791
I'll talk to them.

1544
01:38:26,291 --> 01:38:30,041
Binder, at this age everyone
likes to sit back and relax

1545
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:33,249
But here,
I have to wash the utensils.

1546
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:39,500
Do the laundry, drop Jeeti
to school then pick her up.

1547
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:42,083
I also have to feed her.

1548
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:44,583
Moreover your sister-in-law
will come back and ask...

1549
01:38:44,666 --> 01:38:46,291
...where have I been all day long?

1550
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:48,750
Papa, are you facing
Any problem at home?

1551
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:50,833
I have a problem?

1552
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:53,166
Or do they have a problem with me?

1553
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:55,416
What do you mean?

1554
01:38:55,791 --> 01:38:59,750
Dear, she feels that her
life is filled with sorrows.

1555
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:04,958
And I feel that I don't
have any happiness in my life.

1556
01:39:06,083 --> 01:39:09,583
Why haven't you told sister-in-law
what all you do?

1557
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:13,375
Just like your father, I too
have a lot of responsibilities.

1558
01:39:13,583 --> 01:39:16,791
But I cannot do so much work
at this age...

1559
01:39:17,416 --> 01:39:19,166
As much as my son and my
daughter-in-law expect from me.

1560
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:23,041
Your sister-in-law also
works for 12 hours.

1561
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:25,458
She bears half the
expense of the house.

1562
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:28,249
We had an argument in the morning.

1563
01:39:28,666 --> 01:39:32,625
I thought I should come
here till she calms down a little.

1564
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,833
How are you, Agam?

1565
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:39,541
Where's brother?

1566
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:40,833
He...

1567
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:43,458
Where's your grandpa hiding?

1568
01:39:43,791 --> 01:39:44,916
Grandpa?

1569
01:39:46,166 --> 01:39:47,541
- Mummy?
- Yes?

1570
01:39:47,625 --> 01:39:48,791
Grandpa?

1571
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:53,208
- Grandpa...
- Agam?

1572
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:54,291
Grandpa...

1573
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:55,833
Grandpa is going
to come back, right?

1574
01:39:55,875 --> 01:39:58,291
- Grandpa is going to come back, right?
- Agam?

1575
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:00,250
When is he going
to come back, mummy?

1576
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:01,375
Agam?

1577
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:04,041
Grandpa...

1578
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:06,833
Grandpa...

1579
01:40:10,916 --> 01:40:12,208
Let's go inside,
see if you want something.

1580
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:18,041
[Prayer]

1581
01:40:18,124 --> 01:40:19,582
You came from India decades ago.

1582
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:21,750
You still keep converting
dollars to rupees?

1583
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:23,375
You shouldn't look at this so carefully.

1584
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:25,416
You might end up
spending a dollar or two.

1585
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,041
Don't you think you
are getting too friendly?

1586
01:40:27,125 --> 01:40:27,916
Daan, hold him.

1587
01:40:29,833 --> 01:40:32,250
Beat him up well today.

1588
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:34,791
Please beat him up with care.

1589
01:40:35,166 --> 01:40:36,708
See, even this lady didn't stop you.

1590
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:38,666
She too wants you
to service him with care.

1591
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:40,791
How about you saying
your darling husband?

1592
01:40:40,833 --> 01:40:41,875
Look at her laughing instead.

1593
01:40:41,958 --> 01:40:44,416
Darling husband?
Like you do a lot for her.

1594
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,458
You have such a nice family.

1595
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:48,000
Bless you all.

1596
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:49,916
Thank you for blessings, sister.

1597
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,583
This family was formed
only a few days ago...

1598
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:53,916
...that too in a haste

1599
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,166
This is what happens
when things are done hastily.

1600
01:40:56,791 --> 01:40:57,958
Let me go, buddy.

1601
01:40:58,041 --> 01:41:02,416
Buddy? Like we played
together as kids, mister?

1602
01:41:02,583 --> 01:41:05,791
- I'll do whatever you say.
- Come on, say sorry.

1603
01:41:06,166 --> 01:41:09,916
Kiddo, you shouldn't take time
to thank or apologise to someone.

1604
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,208
Right, sister?

1605
01:41:11,958 --> 01:41:13,291
Sorry!

1606
01:41:13,375 --> 01:41:14,624
Not sorry.

1607
01:41:14,708 --> 01:41:16,458
We need homemade tea.

1608
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:18,250
My stomach is upset after
having coffee on the way.

1609
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:19,708
Like my aunt stays here.

1610
01:41:19,791 --> 01:41:21,708
This great saint wants tea.

1611
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:23,333
Again rude!
Daan, catch him.

1612
01:41:24,375 --> 01:41:27,583
No don't,
I'll make you some tea.

1613
01:41:27,875 --> 01:41:30,041
You all seem like family to me.

1614
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:31,291
Tell me,
who all would like to have tea?

1615
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:33,250
Everyone except him.

1616
01:41:33,416 --> 01:41:34,916
Why won't brother drink any?

1617
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,958
He will drink something
else with me in the evening.

1618
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:38,291
Here I am folding my hands.

1619
01:41:38,375 --> 01:41:40,500
I don't want to drink alcohol.

1620
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:42,625
I want to drink some more.

1621
01:41:42,915 --> 01:41:44,790
I will drink all night long.

1622
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:47,958
I have given my word.

1623
01:41:48,083 --> 01:41:49,541
And I am not a leader.

1624
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,375
You want to offer him some more?

1625
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:55,708
You have invited trouble
for yourself here.

1626
01:41:56,125 --> 01:41:57,541
You won't drink anymore, gentleman.

1627
01:41:58,958 --> 01:42:00,666
I am not gentleman.

1628
01:42:00,958 --> 01:42:02,416
I am bad man.

1629
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,875
Okay then bad man, go to sleep.

1630
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:05,958
Bad man?

1631
01:42:06,708 --> 01:42:10,500
Who are you to call
me bad man, Mr. Daani.

1632
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:12,958
I would have held you by your neck.

1633
01:42:13,041 --> 01:42:15,625
You're saved because
you don't have a neck.

1634
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,208
You have your head
stuck on to your shoulders.

1635
01:42:18,416 --> 01:42:19,416
Sehaj!

1636
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:21,125
He is elder to you.

1637
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:22,625
Give me your glass.

1638
01:42:22,708 --> 01:42:24,250
Oh I see.

1639
01:42:24,708 --> 01:42:27,166
So now you will drink with me?

1640
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,250
This is what I've been waiting for!

1641
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:31,666
You Indian woman!

1642
01:42:31,875 --> 01:42:34,333
You are trying to imitate the foreigners?

1643
01:42:34,416 --> 01:42:36,958
Son, why are you blabbering away?

1644
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:39,083
- Please keep quiet!
- Nope.

1645
01:42:39,166 --> 01:42:41,791
Look, you are under
your mother's oath.

1646
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:51,791
Mother.

1647
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:55,124
I swear upon my mother?

1648
01:42:56,416 --> 01:42:58,250
I don't haven't earned that level yet.

1649
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:03,875
Had I rested my head
on my mother's lap...

1650
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,624
...then she would have lived for
another four years at least.

1651
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,750
Uncle, you shouldn't have
reminded him of his mother.

1652
01:43:11,624 --> 01:43:13,125
I haven't forgotten her.

1653
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:18,791
I have troubled her a lot.

1654
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:26,291
You know, I didn't even
attend my mother's funeral.

1655
01:43:32,041 --> 01:43:37,208
If I had paid off my father's loan
then he wouldn't have strangled himself.

1656
01:43:44,625 --> 01:43:47,125
My father doesn't pay
me a visit even in my dreams.

1657
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,416
I would have sought his forgiveness.

1658
01:44:01,291 --> 01:44:04,041
But, I used to love my father a lot.

1659
01:44:06,666 --> 01:44:08,291
When he used to come back home...

1660
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:12,416
...I used to pretend
that I am sleeping.

1661
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:16,791
But, I used to
sleep only after had returned home.

1662
01:44:21,333 --> 01:44:25,458
Father, I have always wanted to say
this to you when you were alive...

1663
01:44:25,916 --> 01:44:27,333
...but I couldn't say it.

1664
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,833
I love you, father.

1665
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,833
Please forgive me.

1666
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:36,000
I love you, father.

1667
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:43,583
"What will be the use of the
palaces you filled after you are gone?"

1668
01:44:43,666 --> 01:44:53,458
"All the dreams because of which you have
forgotten God will remain unfulfilled."

1669
01:44:53,541 --> 01:45:01,583
"Only your near and dear
ones will pray for you."

1670
01:45:02,083 --> 01:45:04,125
"But everyone's..."

1671
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:08,625
"My dear,
your fate will be decided by Him."

1672
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:15,083
"My dear,
your fate will be decided by Him."

1673
01:45:31,083 --> 01:45:37,665
You have never lost someone's heart...

1674
01:45:37,666 --> 01:45:47,125
"You will have to tell Him everything."

1675
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:55,791
"You might have a lot of
regrets in my heart in the end."

1676
01:45:56,125 --> 01:45:57,875
"But everyone's..."

1677
01:45:59,125 --> 01:46:02,291
"Everyone's fate will be decided by Him."

1678
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:08,333
"My dear,
your fate will be decided by Him."

1679
01:46:22,833 --> 01:46:25,166
Sorry, for last night.

1680
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:29,208
I was getting furious when
you were drinking.

1681
01:46:30,666 --> 01:46:31,791
Then why didn't you stop me?

1682
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:36,333
Because I was loving listening to
what you were saying.

1683
01:46:38,416 --> 01:46:41,625
My mind never let my heart speak.

1684
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:48,750
Sukhdeep, I never knew it is. You feel
good when you let your heart speak.

1685
01:46:49,375 --> 01:46:52,833
How nice would it have been
had your heart spoken up sooner.

1686
01:46:55,791 --> 01:46:59,541
Then perhaps my parents wouldn't have
been so sad when they left this world.

1687
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:03,791
You know what?

1688
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,375
I am so happy today.

1689
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:09,750
Sehaj, who used to love
me from the bottom of his heart...

1690
01:47:10,458 --> 01:47:12,291
...has come back to me today.

1691
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:16,291
And Sehaj too has learnt
that you shouldn't...

1692
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:18,500
...let your mind handle
your relationships.

1693
01:47:19,083 --> 01:47:20,750
You should handle
them with your heart.

1694
01:47:21,083 --> 01:47:22,083
Yes.

1695
01:47:29,416 --> 01:47:33,375
"Only fortunate ones
get this opportunity."

1696
01:47:33,458 --> 01:47:36,416
- There he is.
- "I decorated my wedding headgear."

1697
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:39,916
"I decorated it with
flowers on my own."

1698
01:47:41,166 --> 01:47:43,541
You have got all your stars
under control in this get up.

1699
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:45,916
You have opened the path
to long life and wealth.

1700
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:51,833
Give the groom some ornament to keep
him protected against the evil eye.

1701
01:47:52,332 --> 01:47:54,832
Anyway, let's leave this discussion.

1702
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,500
All of you say
'Happy Birthday' to Magic Singh...

1703
01:47:57,583 --> 01:48:00,041
...because today
is my happy birthday.

1704
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:01,791
- Oh really?
- Happy birthday!

1705
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:04,791
"Happy birthday to you!"

1706
01:48:04,833 --> 01:48:06,374
- Happy birthday to you!
- "Happy birthday..."

1707
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:07,666
Thank you, guys!

1708
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:09,291
But a wedding dress?

1709
01:48:09,916 --> 01:48:11,250
Just a rehearsal.

1710
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:13,916
Actually,
there is a good news for you guys.

1711
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,791
I'm getting married soon.

1712
01:48:15,875 --> 01:48:18,000
Hurrah! [Applause].

1713
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:21,958
So I am doing a dress rehearsal
for it on my birthday.

1714
01:48:22,041 --> 01:48:24,166
Oh, then we all should have a party.

1715
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:26,000
I'll throw a party for your birthday.

1716
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:29,332
You'll only have do it, father.
I am an orphan.

1717
01:48:29,416 --> 01:48:31,333
Don't you dare call
yourself an orphan.

1718
01:48:31,541 --> 01:48:32,833
- I am here for you.
- No!

1719
01:48:33,083 --> 01:48:34,708
How long would you be
here, gentleman?

1720
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:36,666
Only for a day or so!

1721
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:39,166
I want a Father who's going
to live a long life

1722
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:40,500
Then call me your father.

1723
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:42,333
I'm not
going to die anytime soon.

1724
01:48:42,416 --> 01:48:44,416
No, this old man
is very superstitious.

1725
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,250
He will get me involved
in spells and talismans

1726
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,416
Mr. Khan would be good.

1727
01:48:53,833 --> 01:48:55,916
At least he is jovial like me.

1728
01:48:56,708 --> 01:48:57,708
Mr. Khan...

1729
01:48:58,708 --> 01:49:00,375
Would you like to be Magic's father?

1730
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:11,541
Mr. Khan, holding you in my arms...

1731
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:13,791
...will make me feel as if
I've embraced the entire Lahore.

1732
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:26,416
Brother, you have decorated your
turban on your own today but...

1733
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,833
On the day of your wedding,
I will decorate it for you

1734
01:49:29,125 --> 01:49:30,291
Done deal.

1735
01:49:30,583 --> 01:49:32,374
Okay guys,
quickly finish your breakfast.

1736
01:49:32,458 --> 01:49:34,625
There's surprise party for
my birthday somewhere...

1737
01:49:34,708 --> 01:49:37,208
We all have to go
Come on Sehaj, let's keep the bags.

1738
01:49:41,583 --> 01:49:43,166
What's your problem?

1739
01:49:44,624 --> 01:49:46,165
What are you trying to prove?

1740
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:50,833
The same thing I want ask you...

1741
01:49:51,875 --> 01:49:53,375
That, what are you trying to prove?

1742
01:50:01,166 --> 01:50:07,708
I just want that let me face
what is destined for me

1743
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,666
What do you mean?

1744
01:50:14,416 --> 01:50:16,291
When I am the one
who is going to die...

1745
01:50:17,208 --> 01:50:18,833
Then why do you have a dreadful
expression on your face?

1746
01:50:23,416 --> 01:50:26,833
Are you really that brave...

1747
01:50:29,791 --> 01:50:31,583
...or are just pretending to be?

1748
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:42,708
Life... is sweeter than honey.

1749
01:50:46,916 --> 01:50:49,291
And I am not dying by choice

1750
01:50:51,625 --> 01:50:54,000
Life is getting rid of me.

1751
01:50:59,375 --> 01:51:03,625
I can clearly hear
death walking towards me.

1752
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:09,541
if it finds me in tears, will I be spared?

1753
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:16,583
You have made yourself so strong.

1754
01:51:20,291 --> 01:51:24,541
When I couldn't do anything about
it I accepted it as God's will.

1755
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:28,666
The world is afraid of death...

1756
01:51:29,791 --> 01:51:31,916
...that death fills
my mind with bliss.

1757
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:37,958
It is only by death that perfect,
supreme bliss is obtained.

1758
01:51:39,875 --> 01:51:44,458
Sehaj, can you stop me from dying?

1759
01:51:55,625 --> 01:51:57,541
Then don't stop
me from living either.

1760
01:51:58,833 --> 01:52:02,833
Till the time I'm alive,
let me live fully, my friend.

1761
01:52:13,916 --> 01:52:15,291
Come on, buddy.

1762
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:21,250
Come here.

1763
01:52:26,041 --> 01:52:26,875
Come on.

1764
01:52:26,958 --> 01:52:30,375
Happy birthday to you!

1765
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:34,583
- Happy birthday to you!
- Yeah!

1766
01:52:34,832 --> 01:52:38,290
Happy birthday dear Magic!

1767
01:52:38,375 --> 01:52:41,791
- Happy birthday to you!
- Thank you all!

1768
01:52:41,875 --> 01:52:45,916
With Magic's inspiration
and with the love of you all...

1769
01:52:46,291 --> 01:52:49,333
We have made, Ardaas: home of god's
children, functional from yesterday

1770
01:52:49,416 --> 01:52:52,833
Thank you all for being
a part of our lives.

1771
01:52:53,208 --> 01:52:55,833
when I met you at the store the other day,

1772
01:52:56,125 --> 01:52:58,291
...I didn't know
we would ever meet again.

1773
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:03,333
When I heard Magic say
that you shouldn't take time

1774
01:53:03,625 --> 01:53:05,875
To thank or apologize to someone...

1775
01:53:06,541 --> 01:53:08,625
...I immediately called up Jagdeep...

1776
01:53:08,708 --> 01:53:09,875
...and told him...

1777
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:11,916
'I am sorry, Jagdeep.'

1778
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,666
'Come and take me with you today itself.'

1779
01:53:13,666 --> 01:53:16,500
My brother Magic has
made me reconnect with life.

1780
01:53:17,832 --> 01:53:20,832
You have lit a lamp
which had extinguished.

1781
01:53:21,666 --> 01:53:23,333
By staying with these kids...

1782
01:53:23,583 --> 01:53:27,625
...I can keep my deceased
family's memories fresh and alive.

1783
01:53:29,041 --> 01:53:32,875
Now I know that life
doesn't mean stopping...

1784
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,916
...life means one should keep going.

1785
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,583
All thanks to you.

1786
01:53:37,708 --> 01:53:41,333
You gave me an opportunity to
meet such beautiful creations of God.

1787
01:53:41,415 --> 01:53:46,624
So ladies and gentlemen,
now we can say, life is beauti...

1788
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:49,833
Hello, children.

1789
01:53:51,166 --> 01:53:52,541
Come, come...

1790
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:55,041
Come, come, come.

1791
01:54:32,708 --> 01:54:37,375
Mr. Sharma,
God sometimes sends us gifts.

1792
01:54:37,458 --> 01:54:43,291
They are usually close to us,
we just need to recognise them.

1793
01:54:43,625 --> 01:54:45,416
And accept them.

1794
01:54:45,958 --> 01:54:47,958
Come on, kids!

1795
01:54:48,708 --> 01:54:51,166
Everybody, sing with me.

1796
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:54,083
Twinkle twinkle little star!

1797
01:54:54,166 --> 01:54:57,916
- How I wonder what you...
- Stop, stop, stop.

1798
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,166
Follow me only.

1799
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:01,583
Twinkle twinkle little star!

1800
01:55:01,666 --> 01:55:04,375
Twinkle twinkle little star!

1801
01:55:04,458 --> 01:55:06,708
I am happy, how you are?

1802
01:55:06,791 --> 01:55:09,625
I am happy, how you are?

1803
01:55:09,708 --> 01:55:11,916
Live in the present, leave the past!

1804
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,250
Live in the present, leave the past!

1805
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:19,833
Magic...

1806
01:55:19,916 --> 01:55:21,958
Meeting you...
And this tour...

1807
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:23,958
Is no less than a pilgrimage.

1808
01:55:24,666 --> 01:55:26,833
We will now travel
with you every year.

1809
01:55:27,291 --> 01:55:30,083
This boy knows how to
play the game called life.

1810
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:33,291
He can play alone and give
the feeling of being a team.

1811
01:55:33,375 --> 01:55:35,166
Love you, Magic. Love you.

1812
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:36,666
No, Sardarji.

1813
01:55:36,833 --> 01:55:39,291
The real fun of playing
the game is with a team.

1814
01:55:40,582 --> 01:55:42,540
If you want to play a good game...

1815
01:55:43,125 --> 01:55:47,041
...then you stop thinking as if
you are the one plays the game best.

1816
01:55:47,125 --> 01:55:48,708
Well said, prince.

1817
01:55:48,791 --> 01:55:51,125
I'll sing at your wedding.

1818
01:55:51,208 --> 01:55:54,458
"O groom, you are incomparable."

1819
01:55:54,583 --> 01:55:58,083
"You look very good in this dress."

1820
01:55:58,166 --> 01:56:01,458
"God had personally designed you."

1821
01:56:01,541 --> 01:56:04,791
"You are our friend,
you are a pure soul."

1822
01:56:04,833 --> 01:56:07,833
"Your eyes are filled with love."

1823
01:56:07,916 --> 01:56:11,166
"You are surrounded
with delicacies."

1824
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:14,375
"You embrace everyone
and spread love."

1825
01:56:14,458 --> 01:56:17,750
"For me you are
a blessing from God!"

1826
01:56:18,333 --> 01:56:21,791
Well said, Mr. Khan. Well done.

1827
01:56:22,166 --> 01:56:27,000
Mr. Khan should speak at my wedding.

1828
01:56:27,125 --> 01:56:28,625
Sure.

1829
01:56:42,375 --> 01:56:43,458
Sehaj...

1830
01:56:44,499 --> 01:56:45,874
Come on, drive the car.

1831
01:56:47,541 --> 01:56:49,666
I'm handing over the
steering wheel to you.

1832
01:56:50,708 --> 01:56:53,750
Gentlemen, I am feeling sleepy.

1833
01:56:54,583 --> 01:56:59,208
Although exhaustion and tiredness
aren't a part of Magic's dictionary.

1834
01:57:01,458 --> 01:57:03,041
Just for a change.

1835
01:57:04,833 --> 01:57:06,458
For a good sleep.

1836
01:57:08,791 --> 01:57:10,166
Come on, gentleman.

1837
01:58:23,708 --> 01:58:25,750
Come on,
everyone relieve yourselves.

1838
01:58:25,791 --> 01:58:28,791
Let's fill up the car's tank and
empty our tanks. Right, gentleman?

1839
01:58:28,833 --> 01:58:30,875
Wake up, Magic. Fill the tank up.

1840
01:58:30,958 --> 01:58:32,375
- Let's go.
- Let him sleep.

1841
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:33,791
He is tired.
I'll fill it up.

1842
01:58:33,833 --> 01:58:36,541
- Sehaj? Can you go and pay up?
- Okay.

1843
01:58:46,708 --> 01:58:49,666
Brother,
you have maintained the car well.

1844
01:58:49,916 --> 01:58:52,083
It's very clean, just like you.

1845
01:58:52,666 --> 01:58:54,375
Sorry, I hope I
am not disturbing you.

1846
01:58:58,916 --> 01:59:00,708
Come on, Magic, wake up!

1847
01:59:00,791 --> 01:59:01,791
Time to move your chariot.

1848
01:59:01,875 --> 01:59:02,915
Hello, sir!

1849
01:59:03,291 --> 01:59:04,083
Magic!

1850
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,083
Magic!

1851
01:59:05,166 --> 01:59:05,916
Magic!

1852
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,250
Magic!

1853
01:59:07,666 --> 01:59:08,458
Magic!

1854
01:59:08,541 --> 01:59:09,583
- Magic!
- Magic!

1855
01:59:09,666 --> 01:59:10,708
- What happened?
- Call an ambulance!

1856
01:59:10,791 --> 01:59:12,583
Ambulance! Magic!

1857
01:59:12,666 --> 01:59:13,666
- Magic!
- Hello!

1858
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,958
This is an emergency.
Please send an ambulance.

1859
01:59:16,041 --> 01:59:17,000
Magic!

1860
01:59:17,125 --> 01:59:18,250
- Don't do this, buddy!
- Mag...

1861
01:59:19,208 --> 01:59:21,208
- Wake up!
- Please, it's an emergency.

1862
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:23,291
Sent it, please.
- Magic!

1863
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:25,416
Magic!

1864
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:28,458
- What isn't he waking up?
- Get up, Magic!

1865
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:29,500
- Magic!
- Magic!

1866
01:59:29,583 --> 01:59:30,916
- Magic!
- Magic!

1867
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:32,250
Magic...

1868
01:59:33,083 --> 01:59:34,166
Magic...

1869
01:59:40,665 --> 01:59:42,415
Here is petrol pump.

1870
02:00:09,208 --> 02:00:11,125
Oh God...

1871
02:00:15,916 --> 02:00:18,957
Couldn't you have told us
when you learnt...

1872
02:00:19,583 --> 02:00:23,708
...that Magic doesn't have
much time left with him?

1873
02:00:25,625 --> 02:00:31,375
Magic wanted to
live life to the fullest before he dies.

1874
02:00:31,916 --> 02:00:36,708
He said, if someone close to
him learns that he is going to die...

1875
02:00:38,416 --> 02:00:40,875
...then it'd be worse than death for him.

1876
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,875
I'm sorry, we have some bad news.

1877
02:01:30,083 --> 02:01:33,708
Magic had donated his
body for cancer research.

1878
02:01:35,333 --> 02:01:39,166
So, we cannot take his body.

1879
02:01:42,125 --> 02:01:44,958
Doctor has asked all of us
to pay our last respect here itself.

1880
02:01:45,916 --> 02:01:47,416
A body can...

1881
02:01:48,541 --> 02:01:51,125
... sometimes help even after death.

1882
02:01:52,166 --> 02:01:56,333
To think about one's own death...

1883
02:01:58,166 --> 02:02:01,583
...is like betraying yourself, brother.

1884
02:02:09,291 --> 02:02:12,750
"O groom, you are incomparable."

1885
02:02:12,833 --> 02:02:16,208
"You look very good in this dress."

1886
02:02:16,291 --> 02:02:19,625
"God had personally designed you."

1887
02:02:19,791 --> 02:02:22,958
"You are our friend,
you are a pure soul."

1888
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,083
"Your eyes are filled with love."

1889
02:02:26,166 --> 02:02:29,333
"You are surrounded with delicacies."

1890
02:02:29,416 --> 02:02:32,041
"You embrace everyone and spread love."

1891
02:02:32,125 --> 02:02:34,083
'Come on give me a hug!'

1892
02:02:34,166 --> 02:02:36,375
'Later you are only going
to get to hug my dead body!'

1893
02:02:36,541 --> 02:02:39,958
"Where did you go, gentleman?"

1894
02:02:40,958 --> 02:02:42,958
'Brother, you have decorated
your turban on your own today...'

1895
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,666
'...but I will be the one who will
decorate your turban on your wedding day.'

1896
02:02:45,916 --> 02:02:49,958
'When you'll come
to meet me on a full moon...'

1897
02:02:50,166 --> 02:02:53,416
'I shall wait
for you with open arms, My life .'

1898
02:02:53,708 --> 02:02:56,958
'those with
no courage be by your side?'

1899
02:02:57,125 --> 02:03:00,166
'Life, come here, I will wel...'

1900
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:03,500
What kind of a game is this, God?

1901
02:03:05,291 --> 02:03:09,208
The one who wants to die is alive...

1902
02:03:09,666 --> 02:03:15,958
...and the one who was
full of life is dead...

1903
02:03:18,583 --> 02:03:20,291
This is life.

1904
02:03:22,208 --> 02:03:25,208
Life and death aren't
in our hands, Sardar.

1905
02:03:27,125 --> 02:03:29,375
Magic used to live in the present.

1906
02:03:30,166 --> 02:03:34,250
And we are still stuck in the past.

1907
02:03:40,333 --> 02:03:41,958
'Always keep progressing ahead...'

1908
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,750
'...and accept God's will and enjoy life.'

1909
02:03:45,875 --> 02:03:47,250
'Children need to become
their parents' friends.'

1910
02:03:47,333 --> 02:03:51,000
'Children and their parents will have to
become each other's friends, gentlemen'

1911
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:54,625
'Those who try to stubbornly
enforce their decision on destiny...'

1912
02:03:55,041 --> 02:03:57,416
'...can never live a good life.'

1913
02:03:57,958 --> 02:04:00,125
'I was destined to have cancer.'

1914
02:04:00,541 --> 02:04:02,666
'But it didn't make me sad.'

1915
02:04:02,958 --> 02:04:07,000
'Instead I was happy that I got a chance
to live in such a beautiful world.'

1916
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:11,750
'I felt elated to dress like
a groom and celebrate my fake birthday.'

1917
02:04:11,958 --> 02:04:15,583
'Because sometimes you need
to create your own happiness.'

1918
02:04:16,041 --> 02:04:19,333
'Embrace life live in the present.'

1919
02:04:19,916 --> 02:04:21,625
'Be grateful.'

1920
02:04:22,041 --> 02:04:23,916
'Bid goodbye to your grudges.'

1921
02:04:24,166 --> 02:04:28,250
'Life doesn't become beautiful
By mere sloganeering Long live life'

1922
02:04:29,041 --> 02:04:32,250
'And yes, if you see anyone
running away from life...'

1923
02:04:32,583 --> 02:04:34,125
'...then show them the right way to live.'

1924
02:04:34,666 --> 02:04:36,875
'Help them befriend life.'

1925
02:04:39,291 --> 02:04:42,833
'And gentlemen,
plant a sapling in my name.'

1926
02:04:43,125 --> 02:04:46,958
'So that I can grow up to
be a tree and enjoy many seasons.'

1927
02:04:47,666 --> 02:04:49,415
'There is a video on my phone.'

1928
02:04:49,541 --> 02:04:51,375
'You should play it
at my funeral meeting.'

1929
02:04:51,583 --> 02:04:54,000
'And yes, don't miss me.'

1930
02:04:54,666 --> 02:04:55,916
'Feel me.'

1931
02:04:56,041 --> 02:04:57,916
'I am always with you.'

1932
02:04:58,125 --> 02:04:59,500
'Goodbye, my friends.'

1933
02:04:59,833 --> 02:05:02,083
'Yours' truly, Magic Singh.'

1934
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:13,333
"God, I make a humble prayer to You."

1935
02:05:13,958 --> 02:05:18,540
"May everyone get together..."

1936
02:05:18,958 --> 02:05:25,583
"Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian."

1937
02:05:30,958 --> 02:05:34,958
"Let there be no poison
in anyone's heart."

1938
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,875
"Let the feeling of destroy
anyone should come to an end."

1939
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:42,833
"Let there be no poison
in anyone's heart."

1940
02:05:42,916 --> 02:05:46,415
"Let the feeling of destroy
anyone should come to an end."

1941
02:05:46,666 --> 02:05:54,291
"I pray."

1942
02:05:54,375 --> 02:05:58,791
"I pray to God."

1943
02:05:58,875 --> 02:06:02,333
"Let there be love between
parents and children."

1944
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,375
"Let respect always prevail."

1945
02:06:06,666 --> 02:06:12,916
"I pray."

1946
02:06:14,416 --> 02:06:18,708
"I pray to God."

1947
02:06:18,958 --> 02:06:28,333
"Let the weak and the strong, parents
and children support each other."

1948
02:06:28,666 --> 02:06:32,958
"The one which would shake
the soul and take you far away..."

1949
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:37,583
"...may no one ever see such a night."

1950
02:06:38,916 --> 02:06:42,875
"Let no son be bad."

1951
02:06:42,958 --> 02:06:46,500
"Let no parents lose their children."

1952
02:06:46,583 --> 02:06:52,291
"I pray."

1953
02:06:54,416 --> 02:06:58,333
"I pray to God."

1954
02:07:14,541 --> 02:07:22,291
"Give us the strength
to meditate on God's name."

1955
02:07:22,375 --> 02:07:28,915
"Every hour and every
moment of the day."

1956
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:38,166
"Give us the strength
to meditate on God's name."

1957
02:07:38,583 --> 02:07:44,958
"Every hour and every
moment of the day."

1958
02:07:50,333 --> 02:07:51,708
Amar Singh...

1959
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,291
Get up and thank all
those who have gathered here.

1960
02:07:55,958 --> 02:08:00,582
- And say a few words about Magic...
- No.

1961
02:08:01,541 --> 02:08:04,250
I am not worthy enough.

1962
02:08:04,625 --> 02:08:09,000
And Magic had considered
Lahori as his father.

1963
02:08:09,791 --> 02:08:11,500
- Yes.
- Get up, my friend?

1964
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,083
I? But I am a...

1965
02:08:15,291 --> 02:08:19,291
Magic had explained to
you what Guru Sahib had said.

1966
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:25,125
Hindu Muslim, Sikh, Christian...
all are the same.

1967
02:08:26,916 --> 02:08:31,875
In a Gurudwara, everyone
belongs to the same caste, uncle.

1968
02:08:32,375 --> 02:08:34,041
Daan, come on.

1969
02:08:39,833 --> 02:08:43,708
Everyone present here,
you are all a form of God.

1970
02:08:45,583 --> 02:08:49,375
I greet and bless everyone.

1971
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,958
May Waheguru, Allah and Bhagwan...

1972
02:08:56,958 --> 02:09:04,499
...give us all a beautiful
and a healthy life.

1973
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:10,625
We lived one of the best six
days of our lives with Magic Singh.

1974
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:15,750
He was a very lively person.

1975
02:09:16,958 --> 02:09:18,791
A prince of life.

1976
02:09:19,916 --> 02:09:22,875
He lived a very beautiful life.

1977
02:09:24,333 --> 02:09:26,583
Come on, let us all...

1978
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:33,291
...live our lives
Beautifully before we die.

1979
02:09:34,958 --> 02:09:37,624
I thank everyone present here.

1980
02:09:39,125 --> 02:09:44,833
And before I leave,
I request you all to meet Magic Singh...

1981
02:09:46,375 --> 02:09:51,375
...through the video which
he had prepared for us.

1982
02:09:52,208 --> 02:09:52,958
The video.

1983
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,583
You should hold such a
place in the society, o' fakira...

1984
02:09:57,291 --> 02:09:59,583
...that when you laugh,
people should laugh with you...

1985
02:09:59,666 --> 02:10:01,333
...and when you cry,
they should cry with you.

1986
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,041
Hello everyone, I am your Magic...

1987
02:10:04,125 --> 02:10:05,375
Oh sorry.

1988
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:08,500
I was your Magic Singh.

1989
02:10:08,916 --> 02:10:10,291
So you saw my magic?

1990
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,665
Until yesterday I was with you...

1991
02:10:13,791 --> 02:10:15,041
...and today I simply disappeared.

1992
02:10:16,291 --> 02:10:18,875
All of you will perform
this magic one day.

1993
02:10:18,958 --> 02:10:20,583
Because my Baba had said:

1994
02:10:20,958 --> 02:10:23,291
Whatever has been created
shall be destroyed.

1995
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:26,083
Many of you must be crying.

1996
02:10:26,333 --> 02:10:28,958
Don't cry, instead talk about me.

1997
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:32,708
Don't think about how little I lived.

1998
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:36,540
Think about how I lived.

1999
02:10:37,916 --> 02:10:43,166
How I controlled the untamed horse
of life with the whip of happiness.

2000
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:46,666
And how I used the reins
of courage and raced it.

2001
02:10:47,583 --> 02:10:48,541
Oh yes...

2002
02:10:49,875 --> 02:10:53,125
One of our friends has
decided to die tomorrow.

2003
02:10:53,375 --> 02:10:58,583
Death is an offering from God which
will be granted to everyone one day.

2004
02:10:59,875 --> 02:11:03,083
If you want to fix something
then fix your life.

2005
02:11:03,541 --> 02:11:06,000
Fix how you will live before you die.

2006
02:11:06,625 --> 02:11:10,625
And everyone, before you
perform the magic which I just did...

2007
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,958
...do think about whether
you have made your life...

2008
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,375
...a slave to your desires,
grudges and sorrows...

2009
02:11:17,916 --> 02:11:19,583
...and already put an end to it?

2010
02:11:20,666 --> 02:11:25,082
Our wealth, jewellery and land
makes our family fight each other.

2011
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
If you want to bequeath something...

2012
02:11:28,916 --> 02:11:32,375
...then bequesth how much
Happiness one should inherit...

2013
02:11:32,958 --> 02:11:35,125
...and who gets what share of laughter.

2014
02:11:36,125 --> 02:11:40,500
I am leaving my creative
thinking behind for you all.

2015
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:44,541
And as I leave,
I pray for everyone's betterment.

2016
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,916
O Nanak, those who know their true
identity live in excellence and ecstasy...

2017
02:11:48,749 --> 02:11:51,040
...through the power of your Bani,
may everyone be blessed this way.

2018
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:58,958
I made this video so that you
don't remember me as a still face...

2019
02:11:59,208 --> 02:12:01,291
...but as a smiling face.

2020
02:12:02,125 --> 02:12:04,750
O Kabira, when I came into this world...

2021
02:12:04,958 --> 02:12:06,958
...the world rejoiced and I cried.

2022
02:12:07,625 --> 02:12:12,333
Now I leave doing such deeds
that I rejoice and the world cries.

2023
02:12:13,666 --> 02:12:17,333
As Magic leave,
you have to laugh with him.

2024
02:12:19,208 --> 02:12:20,708
You are laughing a lot.

2025
02:12:20,791 --> 02:12:21,958
Who are you connected to?

2026
02:12:22,333 --> 02:12:24,000
I'm making a video, gentleman.

2027
02:12:24,291 --> 02:12:26,125
- A video?
- Whose?

2028
02:12:27,291 --> 02:12:28,541
It's a surprise.

2029
02:12:28,625 --> 02:12:31,541
Are we in it?
Come here!

2030
02:12:31,749 --> 02:12:33,332
- We are here!
- You too join in.

2031
02:12:34,083 --> 02:12:37,833
Include us so that the one who you
are making it for can see us as well.

2032
02:12:44,375 --> 02:12:46,625
- Congratulations on having a
daughter, sister. - Thank you.

2033
02:12:46,708 --> 02:12:48,833
- What name have you given her?
- Gifty.

2034
02:12:48,916 --> 02:12:51,833
Papa says that God is miraculous...

2035
02:12:51,958 --> 02:12:55,125
...and I became a mother
because of His miracle.

2036
02:12:55,332 --> 02:12:56,540
Gifty.

2037
02:12:56,958 --> 02:12:59,208
- A gift from God.
- Yes.

2038
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:03,958
- Agam!
- Yes?

2039
02:13:04,041 --> 02:13:05,208
Shabnam!

2040
02:13:05,583 --> 02:13:07,250
Let Gifty also play with you guys.

2041
02:13:07,333 --> 02:13:08,958
- Come here!
- Come here!

2042
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,166
- Go.
- Go there.

2043
02:13:15,416 --> 02:13:16,791
Grandpa, I am not going to play.

2044
02:13:16,875 --> 02:13:18,125
Sister isn't passing the ball to me.

2045
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:19,166
- Sehaj?
- Yes?

2046
02:13:19,375 --> 02:13:21,375
This boy has taken
after his grandfather.

2047
02:13:23,875 --> 02:13:25,625
Learn to take the ball back, buddy.

2048
02:13:25,708 --> 02:13:27,208
Don't complain, Agam.

2049
02:13:27,416 --> 02:13:29,708
- Thank you. - Daddy, he won't
listen to you if you call him Agam.

2050
02:13:29,791 --> 02:13:31,375
Call him Jhanda.

2051
02:13:33,416 --> 02:13:36,750
Jhanda, if you want to play
the game then play it from your heart.

2052
02:13:36,875 --> 02:13:40,000
- Get involved.
- Okay. Then watch me now.

2053
02:13:40,875 --> 02:13:44,041
There it goes!

2054
02:13:44,333 --> 02:13:45,958
Hurray!

2055
02:13:49,708 --> 02:13:50,916
Pundit, what are you doing?

2056
02:13:50,958 --> 02:13:53,833
Jumping into the sea along
with the sacred threads and talismans?

2057
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:59,208
If you don't have the courage tell me,
I'll push you.

2058
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:01,000
I am not out of my mind.

2059
02:14:02,083 --> 02:14:04,958
Moreover, the one
who has such a beautiful...

2060
02:14:05,041 --> 02:14:07,541
...and loving family can
never have a bad fate.

2061
02:14:11,875 --> 02:14:13,791
Isn't he the one who went missing?

2062
02:14:14,625 --> 02:14:15,625
- It's him!
- Yes!

2063
02:14:15,708 --> 02:14:16,250
Catch him!

2064
02:14:16,333 --> 02:14:17,333
- Brother!
- Then catch him!

2065
02:14:17,541 --> 02:14:18,958
- Brother! Brother!
- Catch him!

2066
02:14:19,041 --> 02:14:20,333
- Brother! Brother!
- Catch him! - Hello!

2067
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:22,583
- Hello!
- Stay away from me!

2068
02:14:22,666 --> 02:14:24,083
- Brother!
- Let me go!

2069
02:14:24,166 --> 02:14:25,958
- Brother! What are you doing, brother?
- Let me go!

2070
02:14:26,124 --> 02:14:28,124
What family are you talking about?
I am not going to go back home.

2071
02:14:29,583 --> 02:14:31,291
- Let me die!
- Your family is looking for you!

2072
02:14:31,375 --> 02:14:32,875
I don't want to go home! Let me die!

2073
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,957
Hello, it is a sin to commit suicide.

2074
02:14:34,958 --> 02:14:35,958
Your soul won't rest in peace.

2075
02:14:36,041 --> 02:14:38,208
It's not like my soul is in peace now.

2076
02:14:38,375 --> 02:14:41,165
Dying a little every
day isn't good either.

2077
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:44,332
Brother, why don't you have some fun,
see the world and then die?

2078
02:14:45,083 --> 02:14:46,416
- Have you ever been to Victoria?
- Yes?

2079
02:14:46,541 --> 02:14:48,250
Kelowna?
-Whistler?

2080
02:14:48,666 --> 02:14:50,666
Sqaumish?
Winnipeg? Ottawa?

2081
02:14:50,875 --> 02:14:52,000
I am not stopping you from dying.

2082
02:14:52,083 --> 02:14:53,291
Enjoy life before you die.

2083
02:14:53,375 --> 02:14:55,500
- Don't die when you are sad.
- Here's my number.

2084
02:14:55,625 --> 02:14:57,125
Call me, we will take you on a tour.

2085
02:14:57,208 --> 02:14:59,416
You should enjoy your
life once before you die.

2086
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:04,750
But why do you want to die?

2087
02:15:05,375 --> 02:15:08,958
A year ago I did an accident by mistake.

2088
02:15:10,250 --> 02:15:13,208
Uncle, accidents happen by mistake only.

2089
02:15:13,666 --> 02:15:14,541
Yes.

2090
02:15:14,791 --> 02:15:16,000
What had happened, brother?

2091
02:15:18,041 --> 02:15:25,083
In that accident a man
and his child lost their lives.

2092
02:15:25,416 --> 02:15:29,541
I cannot carry the burden
of their deaths anymore.

2093
02:15:31,208 --> 02:15:32,083
Brother...

2094
02:15:32,166 --> 02:15:33,500
Where did this accident take place?

2095
02:15:33,583 --> 02:15:34,708
Victoria.

2096
02:15:38,125 --> 02:15:39,916
Do you know anyone from their family?

2097
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:45,833
Guru's Bani gives shelter
to those who seek refuge.

2098
02:15:47,416 --> 02:15:54,125
And, what you cannot borrow
from any one is called life.

2099
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,791
That's why don't give up on life.

2100
02:16:02,208 --> 02:16:05,625
It was an accident and not a murder.

2101
02:16:07,875 --> 02:16:12,500
Therefore, don't murder
yourself by fearing accidents.

2102
02:16:22,958 --> 02:16:23,916
Take this.

2103
02:16:24,791 --> 02:16:26,291
Keep this with you.

2104
02:16:27,333 --> 02:16:31,083
It will keep you away from
Negative thoughts and bad phases in life.

2105
02:16:31,249 --> 02:16:33,165
Engrave this on your heart.

2106
02:16:34,333 --> 02:16:36,083
I am a mantra of happiness.

2107
02:16:36,208 --> 02:16:38,208
And I am an instrument of friendship.

2108
02:16:41,541 --> 02:16:44,958
I will pray for your long life.

2109
02:16:45,958 --> 02:16:47,916
You should pray.

2110
02:16:47,958 --> 02:16:50,750
But not for just one person,
pray for everyone's wellbeing.

2111
02:16:51,416 --> 02:16:55,166
And gentleman,
do remember Magic's mantra.

2112
02:16:55,791 --> 02:16:58,541
I live in the present.
I only believe in right now.

2113
02:16:58,625 --> 02:17:01,000
I consider myself
neither stupid nor smart.

2114
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:04,583
Don't die before you are actually dead.

2115

2117
02:17:30,541 --> 02:17:36,250

2118

2119

support are the ones who win."

2120
02:17:48,083 --> 02:17:54,208

2124
02:18:11,791 --> 02:18:18,000
"Those who are born in
summer don't fear the heat."

2125
02:18:18,083 --> 02:18:23,458
"Those who are born in
floods build skyscrapers."

2126
02:18:23,541 --> 02:18:29,875
"Those who make the darkness
disappear are the ones who win."

2127
02:18:29,958 --> 02:18:35,208
"Those who make bravery their
support are the ones who win.

2128
02:18:35,416 --> 02:18:41,250
"Those who make bravery their
support are the ones who win.

2129
02:18:41,333 --> 02:18:47,124
"You will win if you are adamant."

2130
02:18:47,208 --> 02:18:53,458
"You need to be positive,
if you want to reach your destination."

2131
02:18:59,208 --> 02:19:05,000
"Those who don't fear death,
they aren't easy to kill."

2132
02:19:05,083 --> 02:19:10,416
"Those who have Guru Gobind Singh's
blood in them, they aren't easy to scare."

2133
02:19:10,875 --> 02:19:16,791
"The one who finds the destination
without a map is the one who wins."

2134
02:19:17,291 --> 02:19:22,666
"Those who make bravery their
support are the ones who win.

2135
02:19:22,916 --> 02:19:28,750
"Those who make bravery their
support are the ones who win.

2136
02:19:28,833 --> 02:19:34,500
"You will win if you are adamant."

2137
02:19:34,583 --> 02:19:40,375
"You need to be positive,
if you want to reach your destination."

2138
02:19:40,458 --> 02:19:47,208
"You need to be positive,
