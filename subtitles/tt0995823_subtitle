1
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:43,302
Is Kukuji there?
Look I'm Zarina Sheikh speaking.

2
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:46,172
He told me that he's making
a new film

3
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:49,837
He has a role for my
daughter Nikhat, maybe.

4
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:04,698
No, what are you doing?

5
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,541
You can't do a thing.

6
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:51,307
No, come one.
Do it once more, come on.

7
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:59,117
My name is Nikhat.

8
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:06,527
My name is Nikhat.

9
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:08,721
Hello

10
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,111
It's a pleasure to meet you.

11
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:14,227
My name is Nikhat.

12
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,529
Hello, Mr. Prem.

13
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,337
My name's Nikhat.

14
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:26,947
How my poster is?

15
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:32,517
You still think Mr. Prem

16
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:34,954
is a super star.

17
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:38,198
Think about Mr. Malkani.

18
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:40,653
And about his money.

19
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:42,622
This new boy Ravindar Kumar...

20
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:44,759
He did a brilliant work.

21
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:47,803
Make him visible in
this poster.

22
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,870
A bit more.

23
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:52,331
Although your film
is pretty dull.

24
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:54,341
Maybe it will run.

25
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,254
You do one thing.
- What?

26
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:01,941
For now, go away.

27
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:04,343
And leave this film
as well the next one.

28
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:06,279
Because the poster will
remain the same.

29
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:10,624
And poster for next
film will also be like this one.

30
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,832
Mr. Ravindar's call for you.

31
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,849
You go ahead and
attend your phone.

32
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:25,632
Mr. Khosa, I've heard you're
sending food to Mr. Ravindar.

33
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:28,928
I have to do that.

34
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:33,528
Boy's film is hit. Let him
eat the food, it's his time.

35
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:36,176
You talk to Mala.

36
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:38,946
Send me food as well.

37
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:02,569
It's amazing.

38
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:06,532
Here you're laughing and there
he's going to have a heart attack.

39
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:10,452
So what can I do?
There's nothing in this film.

40
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:13,296
You're doing everything in it.

41
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,542
I'm doing it for you for
the last time.

42
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:17,276
Really?

43
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:19,378
If next time the film revolves
around you, you'll have

44
00:05:19,388 --> 00:05:21,480
to someone else to revolve
around you.

45
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,416
Will you do that?

46
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:25,518
Why are you that angry?
- Leave me.

47
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:28,588
It's not good to
get angry that much.

48
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:47,454
Why are you holding my hand?

49
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:49,702
How can I let you
go before the entry time?

50
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:51,670
I'm not a bitch.
Can't you say?

51
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Entry!

52
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,687
Who's she?

53
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,889
She's Mala.

54
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:40,900
The one who's standing behind
the produce, in gray sari.

55
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:43,188
Nikhat.

56
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:44,890
She was dancer before.

57
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,025
Just started to do films.

58
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:51,239
She has done a couple of films.

59
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,879
She's fond of film since
childhood.

60
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,781
She keeps on watching films.

61
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,452
When she comes home...
- Will you please keep quite?

62
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:48,462
I repeat once again.

63
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,159
You'll have to work very hard.

64
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,169
Are you ready?

65
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:58,572
Yes.

66
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:00,941
Go over there.

67
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:06,213
Go

68
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:16,005
Now walk towards me
from there.

69
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:21,728
What happened?
Come

70
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:23,897
Say "Action".

71
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:28,001
Yes...
Action!

72
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,695
Isn't he going anywhere today?

73
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:32,731
That new chick has come,
boss won't go anywhere now.

74
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:34,500
You are ridiculous.
- What can I do?

75
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,510
I can't help my heart.

76
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,071
Crush a heart like that.

77
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:43,711
It's under your feet,
you can do the job.

78
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:48,480
Hit me.

79
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,015
Yes

80
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,025
What yes?
Hit me.

81
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,717
What are you doing?

82
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,685
Look Nikhat...

83
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:31,455
Unless we don't understand
each other by getting close...

84
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:35,461
It's not possible to do
a good work in acting.

85
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:40,316
Honestly... I'm feeling
that I'm falling in love with you.

86
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:05,397
No matter if I get burnt today,
but you put your heart on his chest.

87
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:08,529
Look, he's coming.

88
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:26,311
That's how the met for
the first time.

89
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,321
Zafar and Nikhat.

90
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:39,158
Zafar Ali Naqvi

91
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:41,168
My childhood friend.

92
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:45,483
He was too young but he
was too wise for his age.

93
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:51,570
By 24 he got one novel and
a collection of stories published.

94
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,000
He was a rising star
in the world of Urdu literature.

95
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:04,683
Sometime ago his family
was very famous in Luknow.

96
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:09,368
But now ruins are there to
tell the stories of the fame.

97
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:15,227
As the result of the
fun loving habits of his father

98
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:18,030
he had four brothers from
four different mothers.

99
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,310
Who's motive for life was
to have fun and fight for the wealth.

100
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:52,965
He was suffocating
in that atmosphere.

101
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:56,501
His mother used to get hurt
by his father's behavior

102
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:59,061
That was not bearable for him.

103
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:16,723
There was another
thing happening in that place.

104
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:24,830
His father's fourth wife grew a desire
for something dangerous and impossible.

105
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Desire for Zafar.

106
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:33,947
What are you doing?

107
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,250
Go away from here.

108
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,932
Will you forgive me now dude?

109
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:01,904
Zafar always regretted
that why he didn't say yes.

110
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:06,494
But sometimes children can't
forgive their fathers.

111
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:09,749
Take us along.

112
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:12,511
Some things are not possible.

113
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:16,176
You feel handicapped.
You can't do anything.

114
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:25,891
After death of his father, he
sent his mother and sister to London

115
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,026
and came to me in Bombay.

116
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:32,297
Where he used to work
in a press in daytime.

117
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:37,469
And at night when we used to go
at bad places for our good desires.

118
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:40,284
There he used to write
his novels.

119
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,850
Look sir, look at your friend.

120
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,518
Why does he waste my time?

121
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:58,056
He doesn't even do a thing with me.
Rather he asks me about politics.

122
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,276
Zafar, what are you doing?

123
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,275
And sometimes, out
of curiosity...

124
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:07,099
In films that I was
assistant director, in.

125
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:09,601
He used to read stories of those films.

126
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:11,611
Without my permission.

127
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:15,307
I'm not being self-praising but...

128
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:16,842
I can write far better than
those stories.

129
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:21,357
Stupid, what I've been
asking you for last six months.

130
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,481
Why don't you write?

131
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:23,749
Write

132
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,649
Should I talk with Mr. Prem Kumar?

133
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:28,828
Should I?

134
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:09,952
Every actress isn't
Ratan Bala.

135
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:17,502
You'll fall on your face.
You'll see.

136
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:19,512
I'll fall in your arms.

137
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:26,344
This films is going to be
a hit. I'm having intuition.

138
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:28,280
Really?

139
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,290
Do you know that man?

140
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:32,892
Yes.

141
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:34,619
He used be the star
of silent cinema.

142
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,179
He was hero in every
next film.

143
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:41,660
But these days he himself
is a silent person.

144
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,670
Do you know why?

145
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:47,132
Because he couldn't see
his end coming.

146
00:16:47,142 --> 00:16:49,142
But I can see mine.

147
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:53,071
But my career is not growing
a bit and you've no worries at all.

148
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:54,339
You're right but...

149
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:56,647
Let me talk to him

150
00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:00,045
I'm worried Mr. Prem.
- What worry?

151
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:02,180
I do worry, because my
money is being invested.

152
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,120
Then do one thing. Stop the film
before more money is lost.

153
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:11,890
Mr. Prem, as I introduced,
my friend Zafar.

154
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,325
Hello
- Hello.

155
00:17:13,335 --> 00:17:17,840
Shamul told me about you,
that you've read our script.

156
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:20,165
Wait for 2 minutes, we're
discussing something important.

157
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:25,272
Either rewrite this script
because time is changing.

158
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:27,139
Look, you know, the audience...

159
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:28,874
You must have asked me to sit,

160
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:31,434
maybe I didn't hear you clear.

161
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:34,938
So I should sit myself.
- Sit down please.

162
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,618
So have you read
our script thoroughly.

163
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:41,628
How was it?

164
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:44,489
Tell me, don't be afraid.

165
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,065
We don't call it being afraid,
we call it manners.

166
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:50,862
Manners?

167
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:56,037
If you still keep your manners
after 10 years, then I'll see.

168
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,472
Tell me what do you think
about our story.

169
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:04,902
What I read, it seemed like
a copy of "Devdas" to me.

170
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:07,253
See?

171
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:15,353
Even in this time,
Chandramukhi stays back after crying.

172
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:17,828
That didn't seem right to me.

173
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,029
Somewhere in the film.
For once...

174
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:25,333
For once she should tell
Devdas that...

175
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,975
"Do you know Dev Babu,

176
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,094
why do you hate your father that much"?

177
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:40,911
"Because somewhere inside yourself
you find your father."

178
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,525
"You too are selfish like him".

179
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,052
Mr. Khosa, cancel the shooting
of "Dukhi Mann".

180
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:49,120
Don't worry I will pay
for the shooting expenses.

181
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,040
Shamul, bring your friend
at my house tomorrow.

182
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:01,967
I'm used to deserted place.

183
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:03,768
It's too noisy place.

184
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:08,181
Just look out of the window.

185
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,475
Seems there's a festival going
on there.

186
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:15,115
The dialogues of the boys
standing in the street.

187
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,115
The voices of baggers and
the riches.

188
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,423
That's called the passion.

189
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:21,086
The emotion.

190
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:26,491
Emotion is fine but there's our set
standing, should I tore it down.

191
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:28,426
So that's your problem.

192
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:31,997
I'm also a filmmaker,
I too have passion,

193
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:34,399
why don't you open a sugar shop?

194
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:37,867
What can I say?

195
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:41,006
That's just a set, if it's standing,
let it standing. What's problem?

196
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:43,016
Don't disturb me.

197
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,544
I'm used to deserted places.

198
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:49,421
This place is too noisy.

199
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:51,959
Just look out of the window.

200
00:19:52,027 --> 00:19:53,918
The noises of horse cart riders.

201
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:56,226
What are you speaking?

202
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:58,156
Do you understand
what you're speaking?

203
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,546
Try to understand the words.

204
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:02,427
Understand the meaning
of deserted places.

205
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:06,517
You should create an atmosphere
with your speech.

206
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:11,856
As I said it's too hard for you.
You can't do it.

207
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:20,545
What you said last time,
I don't know how right your were.

208
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:22,935
But that benefited me a lot.

209
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:24,582
Our story was really
out of date.

210
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:26,717
There's something in you.

211
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:28,720
You'll grow if you'll stay here.

212
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,589
As for now, this lady doesn't
know where's she going.

213
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,695
Just explain her, about her character.
What's that? From where and Who?

214
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:41,465
And it would be better if she
improves her pronunciation.

215
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:50,575
Great

216
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:56,450
No it feels that the best music
director of India is giving his heart.

217
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,039
She's Sharda.

218
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:15,600
You must have seen her films.

219
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,502
Who doesn't know her.

220
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,070
That was long long ago.

221
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,379
For now I'm with this
beautiful doll.

222
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,043
So what did you say
your name was?

223
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:27,053
Zafar.
How do you do?

224
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:32,150
I do it very well.
How do you do it?

225
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:41,092
We usually keep distance
in the first meeting.

226
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:42,727
I could have replied you.

227
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:45,117
I love challenge seeker men.

228
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:53,632
So how did you find
our industry?

229
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:59,986
I feel you can't survive if you
don't make someone your daddy.

230
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:04,382
Yes, first you need make
a daddy for yourself.

231
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:06,484
Then you have to struggle to
get out of that daddy.

232
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:09,387
I shouldn't say this as
Mr. Prem is a dear friend.

233
00:22:09,397 --> 00:22:11,523
Nikhat has come because of him

234
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:14,526
But it's time for her to get
out of his control.

235
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:17,936
Now this song will
be pasteurized on you.

236
00:23:26,174 --> 00:23:29,601
If you changed the whole story,
why do you want me to write?

237
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:30,802
You could have asked a clerk.

238
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:32,470
You can get them very cheap.

239
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,814
What are you saying?

240
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:40,678
You yourself changed the
scene the other day? Remember?

241
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:43,213
I must have been drunk then.

242
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,266
You should trust my memory
at least.

243
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:48,953
I hate him.

244
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:54,128
Do you know Mr. Hashim?
Why do you hate your father?

245
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,795
Because when you see
inside yourself.

246
00:23:57,805 --> 00:24:00,103
You find him.

247
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:04,302
You are like him.

248
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:05,703
Selfish.

249
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:09,945
The difference is only that
he is...

250
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:12,243
Acting in front of Mr. Prem
Kumar was not a play.

251
00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:14,546
But she didn't shake for
a moment.

252
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:17,150
She's incredible.

253
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:21,786
She'll surely get us earn
a lot of money.

254
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:23,796
She's a treasure.

255
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,332
What a diamond we got.

256
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:37,001
Didn't I tell you to keep
her informed.

257
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,004
You've been playing Nikhat's scenes.

258
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:43,808
For Prem Kumar's sake, why
are you trying to get me drowned?

259
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:45,577
Good morning,
how are you?

260
00:24:45,587 --> 00:24:47,587
Come.

261
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:50,923
You sit there.

262
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,655
Get some tea for the Madam.

263
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,029
It's a 10 minute break.

264
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,124
Actually...

265
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:02,599
I was about to come to you...

266
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:18,751
How are you?

267
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,145
It's not what you think.

268
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:22,680
There's a scene for you too.

269
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,883
Actually I wasn't feeling well in
the morning so asked him

270
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:28,386
to inform you that the
shooting has been cancelled.

271
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:32,457
Later I felt well, so I thought I shouldn't
waste producer's money

272
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:34,459
and do the shooting.
It didn't feel good to say

273
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:38,630
that first we cancel the shooting
and then again do it.

274
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,332
That's it. I thought your scene
could be done tomorrow.

275
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:45,167
That was it, and Nikhat you
reacted like this.

276
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:53,185
I meant Ratan.

277
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,650
There can't be any injustice
with you while I'm here.

278
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Go away.

279
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:06,165
Leave me alone.

280
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:47,954
You go with Zafar and
do some rehearsal.

281
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:15,333
Reading couplets...

282
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:18,763
How many times I told you stay
somewhere when it rains.

283
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:19,997
Go and change your clothes.

284
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:22,168
You should've hired cab

285
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:25,371
As if we have a treasure
in the bank.

286
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:29,580
Sherdin, get me some boiled water.

287
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,458
Is he your father?

288
00:27:42,063 --> 00:27:43,921
Look behind, that's my father.

289
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,389
Siraj Sheikh

290
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,399
He was a writer.

291
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:50,833
Continue reading couplets...

292
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:09,993
I can't sit with the
doors closed.

293
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:15,782
I'm a sober person, you must
have observed that by now.

294
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:27,298
Seher, how are you daughter?

295
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:29,066
How's Sarfaraz?

296
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:31,076
Yes, give him phone.

297
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,712
Hello, how are you son?

298
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:37,308
When are your vacations starting?

299
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:41,228
Of course, you will come
to Bombay, where else.

300
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:45,316
I'm Nikhat your elder sister.

301
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:46,517
Hi

302
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:48,019
Listen to me.

303
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:51,939
Mom will come to you and
take you to Ahmedabad.

304
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:54,033
Yes, to Attya Aunt.

305
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:56,964
Look Sarfaraz, don't argue.

306
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:02,542
I will come as soon
as I get time.

307
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:05,344
Ok then.
Bye.

308
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,249
There have been only two
people in my life.

309
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:17,541
Only two.

310
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:19,551
One is my son.

311
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:23,296
And second is my friend.
Prem Kumar.

312
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:26,384
What about me?

313
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:28,394
No chance for me?

314
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:32,723
You are a star.
But he's my friend.

315
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:34,659
He's my brother.

316
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:38,663
I can do anything for you.
And you know I mean it.

317
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:40,031
I know.

318
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,299
Guys, he's not drunk.

319
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,309
Not at all for today.

320
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:50,839
Send me your novel,
I will read it.

321
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:54,486
Mr. Sai told me that.
It's a good novel.

322
00:30:55,623 --> 00:31:00,754
Nikhat, have you met Zafar?
He a talented guy.

323
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:05,196
You read Urdu,
you should read his novel.

324
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:09,936
Only if you say, but
he doesn't seem that good.

325
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:14,123
It's not your fault.
Not everyone can see.

326
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:16,968
And you have an
amazing kind of wisdom.

327
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:20,038
So you two are trying
to pull my leg?

328
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,457
Some friends have requested me.

329
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:34,893
That I should disclose the
news that only I know.

330
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:36,854
It must be a wrong news.

331
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:41,426
I don't speak much
but I'm an emotional man.

332
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:46,007
It's not my fault.
Mr. Prem's marriage has been fixed.

333
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:44,463
I know you're hurt.

334
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:52,696
This marriage in not my choice.

335
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:54,706
What can I do?

336
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:58,711
But I love only you.

337
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:04,680
There are some wishes
of my parents too.

338
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:11,249
But why are you upset?

339
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,686
Nikhat if you'll keep yourself
being someone's wife only

340
00:33:15,696 --> 00:33:19,181
you will be doing injustice
to you talent.

341
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:22,660
You have a unique art that people
will remember you for years.

342
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,305
That's your destination.
Not me.

343
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,188
Should I try?

344
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:54,088
Why? Do you think I can't
drive it?

345
00:34:22,263 --> 00:34:24,263
Stop the car

346
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:46,018
What happened?

347
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:56,620
That was the first producer.

348
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,258
Where I was sent to.

349
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:05,679
How can someone do that
to a 14 years old girl?

350
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:11,377
Like someone's struggling
under you...

351
00:35:12,246 --> 00:35:14,510
and you, by force...

352
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:42,699
I will make my next film
on your novel, maybe.

353
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:46,451
It would be big from me.

354
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,705
I'm a second choice for you,
right?

355
00:40:48,715 --> 00:40:53,047
Who wasn't a second choice
in the history of cinema?

356
00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:55,053
Look who's here?

357
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,681
She's Mr. Prem's fiancée.

358
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:10,327
You are more beautiful
then what we heard.

359
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:12,337
Thank you

360
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,308
She's a good actor.

361
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,160
I'll be right back.
- Please.

362
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:27,886
Well done.

363
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:32,672
I found it for the first time
that you've grown up.

364
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:35,093
Rather too young.

365
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:31,111
I'm still the director.
Take him away.

366
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:34,932
I thought the scene
was over.

367
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:47,463
I have to get up at 7 tomorrow.

368
00:43:04,785 --> 00:43:09,290
You all should also leave
you'll have to get up early.

369
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:13,402
Nikhat let's run our scenes
once more.

370
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:16,462
Understand.
We should sneak out.

371
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:19,456
Are we allowed to finish the drink?

372
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:20,724
We can take the glass.

373
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:22,734
No, no.

374
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:25,971
Finish it here.

375
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:39,076
I hope you've forgiven
me by now.

376
00:43:39,086 --> 00:43:41,945
Next week I'll wait for you
in my cottage.

377
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:43,955
I hope you will come.

378
00:43:49,563 --> 00:43:52,623
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

379
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:02,717
Now you will have to come.

380
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:06,417
Ready, lets do it again.

381
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,112
What was Mr. Prem saying?

382
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:24,788
What are you doing?

383
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:26,798
What I'm doing?

384
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:29,474
Do you think I'm stupid?

385
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,370
Come here.

386
00:44:32,572 --> 00:44:35,832
That night on outdoor.
Where did you disappear?

387
00:44:35,842 --> 00:44:38,647
Don't I know?
You two disappeared.

388
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:44,441
All of the unit knows. What you
did on the floor, I know that too.

389
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:48,445
Didn't your parents teach you
shouldn't interfere in others' life.

390
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:51,090
Stupid! His name is Prem Kumar.

391
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:55,961
If he finds out, forget about
the writing in films.

392
00:44:57,197 --> 00:45:01,277
Rather you will write cheap
ads or wedding cards.

393
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,032
What happened to his
getting in?

394
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,500
Haven't you given him
the good news?

395
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,902
You tell him.

396
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:13,403
You tell him

397
00:45:13,413 --> 00:45:15,677
See Zafar, your good news.

398
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:22,474
That novel of yours...
Prem and I discussed.

399
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:28,649
We will make our next film
on that.

400
00:45:29,262 --> 00:45:36,395
And if you grease my palm,
I'll get you to write the screenplay.

401
00:45:39,506 --> 00:45:41,940
Mr. Prem keeps his promises.

402
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:55,712
I can't keep on playing this game.

403
00:45:55,722 --> 00:46:00,482
At one side Mr. Prem's favors
and on other side it's you.

404
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:04,746
Let me know or just
end this relationship.

405
00:46:06,032 --> 00:46:08,837
Why are you getting confused now?

406
00:46:09,669 --> 00:46:12,559
He needs you as much
as I need you.

407
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:39,015
We've heard that your next film
will also with Prem and Nikhat.

408
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:40,951
Do you have any objection?

409
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:45,322
After so long, I've found a great
story that Zafar wrote.

410
00:47:45,332 --> 00:47:47,332
Zafar come here.

411
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,645
You turned out to be
a betrayer.

412
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:17,974
Actually Mr. Prem Kumar

413
00:50:19,652 --> 00:50:23,315
Either I could betray you
or betray myself.

414
00:50:26,392 --> 00:50:28,687
So I decided to betray you.

415
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:39,869
I don't want to misbehave,

416
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:43,073
but I was thinking that we two are going
to talk in private,

417
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:46,313
than what's this Pandit Ji doing here?

418
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,712
You know we are making film,

419
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:52,949
I thought that why don't we get a story
from the Pandit's treasure,

420
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:57,719
and the girl over there, he wants to
take her as actress,

421
00:51:58,331 --> 00:51:59,956
she's quite attractive,

422
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:01,191
quite attractive,

423
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,494
I know she needs some modifications,
but I found the previous actress like this,

424
00:52:04,504 --> 00:52:08,186
I'm telling you Sir, she's a gem,
I have seen her screenplay myself,

425
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:10,196
My torso become raised,

426
00:52:11,544 --> 00:52:14,859
you call "that" torso in your language?

427
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:21,077
Jokes apart, she's quite fantastic,

428
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:23,892
why don't you take a screen test?

429
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:41,939
Where had you been?

430
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:50,481
What's this?

431
00:52:54,154 --> 00:52:58,681
You're not going to make picture,
so why don't you give me back!

432
00:52:58,691 --> 00:53:00,483
Than what will you do?

433
00:53:00,493 --> 00:53:02,788
We will try somewhere else!

434
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,122
And If the cinema is
premises of two or four men,

435
00:53:06,132 --> 00:53:08,132
I'll go back!

436
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:09,826
We'll open up some shop!

437
00:53:09,836 --> 00:53:11,661
Come over here1

438
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:13,671
come here!!

439
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:28,745
How dare you talk to me like this?

440
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:31,220
What all of guys think of me?

441
00:53:31,825 --> 00:53:33,316
Am I a fool or what?

442
00:53:33,326 --> 00:53:36,046
I'm not like your friend Shamol!

443
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,355
I'm Noni Gaoli,

444
00:53:39,365 --> 00:53:40,657
Noni Gaoli!

445
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:43,493
I just make the picture,
what I want to make,

446
00:53:43,503 --> 00:53:45,028
Understand!

447
00:53:45,038 --> 00:53:47,430
Is Prem Kumar brought me
in this industry??

448
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,180
So why do I have to ask him
to make a picture

449
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:04,324
can you give me the signing amount
back?? I'm in need!

450
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:26,660
I'm quite disappointed to you!

451
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:29,973
No no,
don't say like this,

452
00:54:29,983 --> 00:54:31,983
Please forgive me,

453
00:54:32,118 --> 00:54:33,476
Please I'm sorry!

454
00:54:33,486 --> 00:54:35,486
Leave my leg!

455
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:38,081
Common leave me!
Leave my leg!

456
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:40,091
Leave me!

457
00:54:53,172 --> 00:54:58,272
Now you tie his Trouser(dhoti)
Or he'll turn off your lights!

458
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:19,055
Listen to the Story

459
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,024
Story is of Gayitri,

460
00:55:21,034 --> 00:55:22,792
who is married!

461
00:55:22,802 --> 00:55:25,962
She was in love with younger brother,
but married to elder brother

462
00:55:25,972 --> 00:55:30,366
after sometime afterward!
Younger brother turned out to be terrorist,

463
00:55:30,376 --> 00:55:33,069
and elder brother turned out Jailer!

464
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,338
That's the point story begins,

465
00:55:35,348 --> 00:55:39,375
when younger brother comes to Gayitri
for help,

466
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:41,945
to release his other terrorist friends,

467
00:55:41,955 --> 00:55:43,780
this is the same story!

468
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:44,847
Why are you telling me this one!

469
00:55:44,857 --> 00:55:47,317
Noni Gaoli is not making this movie!

470
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:48,384
Listen!!

471
00:55:48,394 --> 00:55:50,394
Then people comes back,

472
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:53,672
and make both of them in a relation

473
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,852
so it means Nonita is making this
picture!

474
00:55:58,071 --> 00:56:01,556
Who's performing Gayitri in this picture?

475
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,335
Nowadays, Nonita listens to me much!

476
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:09,042
You just tell me once,

477
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,008
just have to make some calls,
no one will interfere in this picture,

478
00:56:12,018 --> 00:56:13,643
and no one will finance him for this,

479
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:15,378
I can bet on that,

480
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:17,388
we'll teach Nonita!

481
00:56:18,591 --> 00:56:19,949
Hey!

482
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,959
Make me a strong drink

483
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:25,429
he's gone mad,

484
00:56:25,765 --> 00:56:27,290
going to start picture without,
Prem Bhai,

485
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,275
film will definitely going to flop!

486
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:36,332
This is act of cheapster,

487
00:56:36,342 --> 00:56:38,342
that don't suits you,

488
00:56:45,718 --> 00:56:47,977
don't know why it looks to me, that...

489
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,987
you know some Gayitri,

490
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:54,525
I'm a writer,

491
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:58,594
It's my profession to understand
peoples!

492
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:08,018
It means you don't know her?

493
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:12,710
Just a bit,

494
00:57:16,783 --> 00:57:19,418
like younger wife of my father,

495
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:23,446
My husband is a Jailor

496
00:57:23,456 --> 00:57:25,496
he's just doing his job,

497
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:28,993
and I'm doing mine,

498
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,454
and what If I won't help you?

499
00:57:31,464 --> 00:57:33,460
Than what?

500
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:35,224
How many time do I have to tell you,

501
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:37,274
that run away from here!

502
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,766
Me myself in a prison,

503
00:57:39,776 --> 00:57:41,772
who will rescue me?

504
00:57:42,008 --> 00:57:44,133
Don't you expect from me,

505
00:57:44,277 --> 00:57:46,102
It's not even possible,

506
00:57:46,112 --> 00:57:48,407
Please forgive me, Gayitri,

507
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:52,321
After father's death,
he beat me to run away!

508
00:57:52,985 --> 00:57:58,595
It's was much better to see you prostitute,
than my brother's wife,

509
00:58:03,863 --> 00:58:05,354
where is he?

510
00:58:05,364 --> 00:58:07,364
Committed suicide,

511
00:58:16,843 --> 00:58:18,843
Good bye!

512
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,581
Gayitri!
Gayitri!

513
00:58:24,517 --> 00:58:26,517
Gayitri!

514
00:58:26,853 --> 00:58:28,853
Gayitri!

515
01:00:04,016 --> 01:00:06,906
What happened to your Prem Kumar??

516
01:00:07,753 --> 01:00:10,947
The whole industry can not
depend upon single man!

517
01:00:10,957 --> 01:00:13,507
Change is the attempt of life!

518
01:00:16,996 --> 01:00:18,821
I want to talk to you regarding
your father

519
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:19,822
wait a minute,

520
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:21,490
I have to talk to him,

521
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,500
come with me

522
01:00:26,339 --> 01:00:28,864
I'm doctor there in Hyderabad!

523
01:00:28,874 --> 01:00:31,594
I was looking after your father,

524
01:00:31,744 --> 01:00:34,178
he died about 2 years ago,

525
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:37,974
before his death, he use to say that...

526
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:42,234
I want to meet my daughter and ask
for forgiveness!

527
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:44,614
I was here in Bombay,

528
01:00:44,624 --> 01:00:46,315
came here eventually,

529
01:00:46,325 --> 01:00:48,818
so I thought I should tell you all this,

530
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:53,163
who knows afterward I
got a chance to tell you this,

531
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:18,247
I definitely would have worked with Nikhat,
if Waheeda won't here,

532
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,722
but only if she weren't here,

533
01:01:36,475 --> 01:01:39,468
writing for someone else,
it has become quite difficult job for me,

534
01:01:39,478 --> 01:01:41,904
I will make my own film or will
leave this industry,

535
01:01:41,914 --> 01:01:44,039
first come sign the hero!

536
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,286
How many times did I told you,
I don't want to do your film,

537
01:01:57,296 --> 01:02:00,163
Take that money in your back,

538
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,700
and take a deep sleep!

539
01:02:09,342 --> 01:02:11,967
I liked your idea, that day too,
but tell me the story!

540
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:14,236
The one is marrying let them be,

541
01:02:14,246 --> 01:02:16,272
the one is marrying let them be,

542
01:02:16,282 --> 01:02:20,702
they are ruining their life,
and we are ruining ours,

543
01:02:24,256 --> 01:02:26,615
you don't have idea of direction,

544
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:30,419
A well experienced director is needed
for such story!

545
01:02:30,429 --> 01:02:32,088
For example Goadar Sahab,

546
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:34,098
or Nonida!

547
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:38,661
No one else will understand, the
details of this story,

548
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,796
and I won't give this story to anyone!

549
01:02:40,806 --> 01:02:44,166
The passion you showed to tell your story,

550
01:02:44,176 --> 01:02:46,102
are you able to capture this on film?

551
01:02:46,112 --> 01:02:49,087
You live your life quite measuring,

552
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:51,928
try sometimes your luck too,

553
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:06,258
Prem Kumair is just coming,

554
01:03:06,966 --> 01:03:09,859
you are a star, now you are
going to be a friend,

555
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,961
we'll make this film together,
we don't have any confusion in that,

556
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:13,971
is there any confusion?

557
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,902
That's good,
it means done!

558
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:21,737
So it's done!

559
01:03:21,747 --> 01:03:23,747
Congratulations!

560
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:36,012
It can't happen,
she can't do it,

561
01:03:36,495 --> 01:03:39,922
you are saying that make time
for three months for your picture,

562
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:43,092
when Ravinder can do than,
why can't she?

563
01:03:43,102 --> 01:03:45,060
What non sense are you talking?

564
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:47,620
Both situations are different,

565
01:03:51,377 --> 01:03:54,703
It can't happen on Ravinder's one pinch,

566
01:03:54,713 --> 01:03:56,038
I'll talk to Ravinder, what will happen,

567
01:03:56,048 --> 01:03:58,073
you can make your picture next year,

568
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,575
did I interfere in your job?

569
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,076
Did I interfere in your job?

570
01:04:01,086 --> 01:04:02,778
You shouldn't be interfering too,

571
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:06,528
Zafar we can talk about this,
somewhere else!

572
01:04:10,262 --> 01:04:12,472
What it got to do with me?

573
01:04:12,698 --> 01:04:14,223
Did I say?

574
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:16,358
You told me to look after Nikhat's work,

575
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:19,513
and now I'm looking after,
so let me!!

576
01:04:29,048 --> 01:04:33,843
It's quite disappointing,
that you aren't doing this film,

577
01:04:33,853 --> 01:04:36,233
It was written just for you,

578
01:04:53,172 --> 01:04:55,172
what a shot!

579
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,810
It's a short industry,
Zafar!

580
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:24,068
Containing 50 to 100 people,

581
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,647
and here everyone knows everything,

582
01:05:34,146 --> 01:05:36,146
so tell me?

583
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,141
Why should I do you film?

584
01:05:43,889 --> 01:05:48,734
Because no one else can perform
this role better than you,

585
01:05:50,129 --> 01:05:52,129
Lie!

586
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:03,933
It's true that Nikhat was going to have this role,

587
01:06:03,943 --> 01:06:05,983
but now she isn't doing,

588
01:06:07,479 --> 01:06:13,174
there must be a reason that,
we came to you leaving other actresses,

589
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,059
again Lie!

590
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:28,880
If you aren't able to understand
this little thing,

591
01:06:29,535 --> 01:06:33,020
I didn't get why are we wasting our time,

592
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:35,245
you must be busy enough!

593
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:39,702
Good Bye,

594
01:06:39,712 --> 01:06:41,712
Oh God!

595
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,780
This much attitude!

596
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:49,118
That's the reason, what made Nikhat
to fall for you,

597
01:07:19,151 --> 01:07:21,151
you are threatening me?

598
01:07:22,554 --> 01:07:27,685
I'm begging you so such
situation may not come,

599
01:07:32,765 --> 01:07:37,326
there must be some your relation
with my mother sometime,

600
01:07:37,336 --> 01:07:43,241
for the sake of that relation, please
do this last favour for us,

601
01:08:05,731 --> 01:08:08,111
Lalan, I'm going to my home,

602
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:18,601
leave him,
he's your younger brother,

603
01:08:19,945 --> 01:08:22,240
are you guys become insane?

604
01:08:25,417 --> 01:08:29,752
I know why you misbehave with your
father this much,

605
01:08:32,591 --> 01:08:35,141
So you have become a Director!

606
01:09:53,672 --> 01:09:59,197
By the way, I came to hear,
that Nikhat is working with Raj Kumar!

607
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,828
Someone called me and told me,

608
01:10:03,882 --> 01:10:06,007
it's strange of you both,

609
01:10:06,218 --> 01:10:08,683
how can you allow both things

610
01:10:10,889 --> 01:10:14,629
whatever, different lives,
different stories,

611
01:10:49,561 --> 01:10:55,256
I'm just telling that, instead of doing
all flop movies...
Good bye!!

612
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,362
Can I?

613
01:11:33,772 --> 01:11:35,772
You have come!

614
01:11:40,612 --> 01:11:41,970
At least now forgive me son!

615
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,739
Out it

616
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:48,339
No sir, you aren't remembering your theme
of character,

617
01:11:48,987 --> 01:11:54,852
that's his quality that, he won't
leave his ego, at the time of death,

618
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:16,538
now it's the time for this picture to
The End!

619
01:12:16,548 --> 01:12:20,042
You are the producer, whatever you'll
do is okay!

620
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:21,510
But I want to tell you that,

621
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,600
this is the most beautiful
film I have ever done,

622
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,160
but baby!!

623
01:12:30,462 --> 01:12:34,589
At least we have to shout over director
or else they will delay much,

624
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:42,164
but I'm not going to tolerate, if it happen again,
Go make him understand, or film is end!

625
01:12:42,574 --> 01:12:44,699
I'll make him understand,

626
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:50,878
this film is definitely a hit,

627
01:12:52,985 --> 01:12:54,609
this picture is not going to fail,

628
01:12:54,619 --> 01:12:56,712
you sure?
I'm giving you my words,

629
01:12:56,722 --> 01:12:59,612
Come lets' go,
Ok than let it roll!

630
01:14:34,653 --> 01:14:38,180
So the film is totally flop in short,

631
01:14:42,127 --> 01:14:43,752
Cuckoo,
yes?

632
01:14:43,762 --> 01:14:46,397
I'm quite worried about Zaffar!

633
01:14:46,465 --> 01:14:48,924
What's of Zafar?
We lost our money!

634
01:14:48,934 --> 01:14:50,792
Money is not a problem,

635
01:14:50,802 --> 01:14:53,428
we'll sell some lands, and get money,

636
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:55,130
and we'll start another film,

637
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,365
but what will become of Zafar?

638
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:58,934
Zafar is finished!

639
01:14:58,944 --> 01:15:00,944
Much better,

640
01:15:56,535 --> 01:15:58,535
where is Nikhat?

641
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:37,173
I'm in room upstairs,

642
01:17:02,267 --> 01:17:07,962
than Zafar has left Mumbai, one day,
without telling anyone even me.

643
01:17:40,939 --> 01:17:43,489
Because I was in the industry,

644
01:17:43,808 --> 01:17:45,808
life goes on,

645
01:17:49,714 --> 01:17:54,814
Shoukat look, Shavan Sir is here,
he has become producer now.

646
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:03,111
She was a good actress, then
why is she signing such movies?

647
01:19:03,121 --> 01:19:05,121
She's in need of money!

648
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:09,391
Only she is in need or you too

649
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:19,594
there must came up stories like,
that I make film with Nikhat's money!

650
01:19:19,604 --> 01:19:21,604
But on the bad times,

651
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,305
who arranges the money?
I do!!

652
01:20:19,063 --> 01:20:22,390
Only those can find us, whom
we want to meet,

653
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,492
several days I was with Mom,
in London,

654
01:20:24,502 --> 01:20:27,987
thought a lot of times to get back there!

655
01:20:28,273 --> 01:20:30,031
But didn't have courage to come back,

656
01:20:30,041 --> 01:20:32,400
there are some people I
don't want to meet,

657
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:35,640
and some people don't want to meet me,

658
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:39,059
whenever I have courage to come back,

659
01:20:39,284 --> 01:20:42,514
hope you won't close the doors for me,

660
01:21:35,173 --> 01:21:38,132
there is someone who wants
to make movie on my new novel,

661
01:21:38,142 --> 01:21:42,392
they are among them,
who understood my last picture

662
01:21:42,514 --> 01:21:45,340
and once again my passion to do something,
has raised,

663
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:50,960
don't know about Nikhat, but hope
that old friends has forgiven me,

664
01:21:52,624 --> 01:21:56,194
Industry is not anymore
like what you left,

665
01:21:56,861 --> 01:22:01,706
there came a lot of changes, besides
black white to color,

666
01:22:03,868 --> 01:22:07,183
what you think, I'm
still on that place?

667
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,160
What will be your cast for film?

668
01:22:13,578 --> 01:22:15,578
Ravender,
and??

669
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:20,107
Want to cast Prem Kumar too,

670
01:22:23,788 --> 01:22:25,788
who is the actress?

671
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,385
I don't want to dance with you,

672
01:23:04,395 --> 01:23:05,420
what a surprise?

673
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:07,430
Go away!

674
01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:10,998
Don't you understand in once!

675
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,361
Enough of non sense!

676
01:23:13,371 --> 01:23:15,597
Have been telling for a while,

677
01:23:15,607 --> 01:23:17,607
where were you?

678
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:19,709
Where were you?

679
01:23:29,454 --> 01:23:33,481
Why in the name of God did you
go away?

680
01:24:23,341 --> 01:24:25,341
Someone has help out,

681
01:24:31,182 --> 01:24:33,477
who else was there for her?

682
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:40,381
And why I'm I explaining it to you,

683
01:24:40,391 --> 01:24:44,152
It wasn't like this, that you're here,
and I've done something wrong on your back,

684
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,162
or I deceived you!!

685
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:50,099
I didn't marry to her,

686
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:00,868
no one deceives anyone,

687
01:25:04,649 --> 01:25:07,114
it's all matter of Situation,

688
01:25:23,468 --> 01:25:25,763
I'm taking her away, Zafar,

689
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:28,596
the profession is quite difficult,

690
01:25:28,606 --> 01:25:33,196
entering into this and not to fall,
it's is impossible,

691
01:25:35,113 --> 01:25:38,598
she will break, if she live here anymore,

692
01:25:40,818 --> 01:25:44,813
but living without profession,
is not possible,,

693
01:25:48,192 --> 01:25:50,192
look at me,

694
01:25:53,798 --> 01:25:55,798
I have came back...

695
01:26:06,544 --> 01:26:09,069
Do whatever you want to!

696
01:26:12,483 --> 01:26:14,693
But stay away from Nikhat,

697
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,470
you have ruined her life once,

698
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:21,390
don't do it again

699
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:23,926
alright!!

700
01:26:41,813 --> 01:26:44,788
Shabbo, you gave medicine to madam?

701
01:26:50,054 --> 01:26:52,380
I'm going to bring two tickets for Nairobi,

702
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:54,390
of next week!

703
01:26:54,992 --> 01:26:58,477
One week would be enough for the packing,

704
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:07,995
I'm going to Doctor Shah!

705
01:27:08,072 --> 01:27:10,698
He's giving a letter to the name of
Dr. Burnett

706
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:15,736
Nikhat do whatever you want to,
within next 7 days,

707
01:27:18,716 --> 01:27:21,576
Say farewell to everyone
you want to say,

708
01:27:21,586 --> 01:27:27,366
and we are going than Nikhat, and will
come back only if you be okay!

709
01:30:44,655 --> 01:30:46,655
Good Morning baby!

710
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:50,151
It's Zafar's script,

711
01:30:50,161 --> 01:30:52,520
last night he gave that to me,

712
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,165
looks like you've already read,

713
01:30:56,767 --> 01:30:58,300
Nikhat,
I have to go,

714
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:00,520
Nikhat!
Nikhat! Your phone!

715
01:31:02,973 --> 01:31:04,973
Sorry

716
01:31:25,996 --> 01:31:29,736
you came to me, leaving all the past behind,

717
01:31:30,301 --> 01:31:32,301
so I must do your film,

718
01:31:35,473 --> 01:31:39,128
just tell me who is playing role of Nikhat?

719
01:31:40,177 --> 01:31:41,302
Mean?
Common Zafar,

720
01:31:41,312 --> 01:31:43,312
nothing to hide,

721
01:31:44,482 --> 01:31:49,577
you wrote our film, just changed the profession,
and entered us in dance,

722
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:56,959
tell me If I'm me, and you are Ravinder,
than who's playing for Nikhat?

723
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:15,285
So what if that's the best
script of the world,

724
01:32:15,412 --> 01:32:17,412
why you read that?

725
01:32:18,082 --> 01:32:20,642
I gone to Sharda's place,

726
01:32:21,085 --> 01:32:24,145
he was sleeping,
it was on the table,

727
01:32:24,955 --> 01:32:27,114
why are you getting angry this much,

728
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:28,449
I just read it,

729
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:30,217
I know you well,

730
01:32:30,227 --> 01:32:35,589
you're going to say now,
Shamur, just once, let me do this last movie,

731
01:32:35,599 --> 01:32:36,790
One movie!

732
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,945
And why is it here,
I don't like this,

733
01:32:42,406 --> 01:32:44,406
than eat it,

734
01:32:45,709 --> 01:32:49,364
it's not possible in this
condition of yours

735
01:32:49,446 --> 01:32:51,446
you may end your life,

736
01:32:53,584 --> 01:32:55,964
It could be your last movie!

737
01:32:56,687 --> 01:32:59,046
And I don't want to lose you, Nikhat!

738
01:32:59,056 --> 01:33:01,181
Don't do this to yourself

739
01:33:01,926 --> 01:33:05,071
don't play with your own life,
Nikhat!

740
01:33:17,608 --> 01:33:21,518
You actress was here, so
we cannot let her out,

741
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:28,856
I'm just getting ready,
only one earring left,

742
01:34:28,866 --> 01:34:30,866
go bring it,

743
01:34:33,384 --> 01:34:36,869
I'm doing after a long time that's why...

744
01:34:37,855 --> 01:34:41,340
actually, I'm here to say something else!

745
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:48,222
Thank you,

746
01:34:48,232 --> 01:34:50,232
to act in our film

747
01:36:00,037 --> 01:36:02,037
good dance!

748
01:36:03,907 --> 01:36:05,907
Was it ok?

749
01:36:07,144 --> 01:36:09,977
Seriously it was too good!

750
01:36:11,515 --> 01:36:13,515
How much?

751
01:36:24,495 --> 01:36:26,495
Nikhat!

752
01:36:28,632 --> 01:36:30,632
Nikhat!

753
01:36:33,771 --> 01:36:35,771
Nikhat you alright?

754
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:40,876
Call Shamur here!

755
01:36:43,046 --> 01:36:44,638
Shamur Sir, everyone was gone,

756
01:36:44,648 --> 01:36:48,898
when I came there to lock makeup room,
I saw her...

757
01:37:01,365 --> 01:37:04,491
didn't I told you to stay away from her!

758
01:37:04,501 --> 01:37:06,626
She cannot bear all this!

759
01:37:07,171 --> 01:37:09,171
I told you already!

760
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:11,740
But no,

761
01:37:12,209 --> 01:37:13,734
why would you listen to me!

762
01:37:13,744 --> 01:37:15,869
You guys think me a fool!

763
01:37:22,085 --> 01:37:24,085
What you think,

764
01:37:24,254 --> 01:37:26,974
didn't I tried to give her work?

765
01:37:29,293 --> 01:37:31,333
She wasn't able to do...

766
01:37:32,663 --> 01:37:34,663
do you know why?

767
01:37:36,366 --> 01:37:38,366
Because she is ill,

768
01:37:39,703 --> 01:37:42,229
she has a hole in heart Zafar,

769
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:44,239
she has a hole in heart

770
01:37:45,008 --> 01:37:50,070
I came to know when she started
drinking and went to hospital,

771
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,310
that's why I was taking her from here!

772
01:37:53,417 --> 01:37:55,417
Understood

773
01:38:05,496 --> 01:38:07,496
leave her Zafar!

774
01:38:08,999 --> 01:38:10,999
Cast someone else!

775
01:38:11,134 --> 01:38:13,134
She can not do it.

776
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:15,395
You guys are doing wrong!

777
01:38:23,514 --> 01:38:27,764
You guys are thinking that you are
saving her life,

778
01:38:39,463 --> 01:38:42,955
like this, she will end up slowly slowly!

779
01:38:46,403 --> 01:38:49,463
Or she may die while doing our film,

780
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:54,268
but she will definitely will die,
if she stays with her,

781
01:38:54,278 --> 01:38:56,278
didn't I know?

782
01:39:07,624 --> 01:39:09,624
But what can I do??

783
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:11,693
I don't have any right!

784
01:39:11,929 --> 01:39:14,479
Or else I'll take her with me!

785
01:39:17,901 --> 01:39:19,901
But I don't have right!

786
01:39:25,509 --> 01:39:27,509
Zafar!

787
01:39:33,984 --> 01:39:35,984
Will you marry me?

788
01:39:37,354 --> 01:39:39,989
No one can say anything to you,

789
01:39:42,559 --> 01:39:44,559
All rights are for you!

790
01:39:47,698 --> 01:39:49,823
I'm giving you the right!

791
01:39:50,567 --> 01:39:53,032
Do whatever you want with me!

792
01:39:54,671 --> 01:39:56,096
Nikhat!!

793
01:39:56,106 --> 01:39:58,106
Kill me!!

794
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:04,479
Get away brother!

795
01:40:11,555 --> 01:40:13,555
Don't unsign me!

796
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:15,890
Please!

797
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:21,458
I promise, I won't let you down this time!

798
01:40:25,068 --> 01:40:27,618
Just don't unsigned me please!

799
01:41:58,128 --> 01:42:00,392
Please forgive me now!

800
01:42:44,141 --> 01:42:45,499
Nikhat!

801
01:42:45,509 --> 01:42:46,566
Nikhat!

802
01:42:46,576 --> 01:42:48,001
Somebody call an ambulance!

803
01:42:48,011 --> 01:42:50,011
Nikhat!

804
01:43:12,903 --> 01:43:14,903
It was the anklet!
