1
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:12,566
You're still alive?

2
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:15,901
Darn!
- Will have to do this again.

3
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:18,366
And cut!

4
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,167
Let's move on to the close-up.

5
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Hey!

6
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:26,500
l hope you don't have
to do it again, man.

7
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,500
You can do this all day. Come on.
- l can't.

8
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:29,566
l just tried.

9
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:30,966
All right. See you later.

10
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:40,367
Man, what a shot!

11
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,168
You jumped, and it looked
like it was Brandon there.

12
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,567
Anything for Hollywood, man.

13
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:46,900
Another great shot as usual.

14
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,902
lt's a pleasure always doing
stunts for you Mr. Brandon.

15
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,567
Don't forget about the
poker game tomorrow.

16
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:52,633
l'll be there. l'll be there.

17
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,301
l think you have a visitor.

18
00:04:57,366 --> 00:05:00,435
Not for me. Must be for you.
You're the cool dude.

19
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:04,101
No, you're the player.

20
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:05,966
Viraj.

21
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:09,566
Excuse me.

22
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:12,966
Hi, beautiful.

23
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:15,033
You left me in the tub.

24
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,434
Baby that was three days ago.

25
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,167
But l waited.

26
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:22,633
l'm really sorry.

27
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,434
l will make it up tonight.
l promise.

28
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:27,566
Oh..

29
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:28,966
Viraj!

30
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,434
How is he going to
get out of this one?

31
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,569
Brother, lots of practice.

32
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:43,502
''l am a bad boy.''

33
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,301
Brother, whose house
should l take you to?

34
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:51,433
Let me think.

35
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,567
Phone.

36
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,034
We're not deaf, moron.

37
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,367
Thank you. Hello.

38
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,100
What?

39
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,900
Scoundrel!
- What the hell!

40
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,967
Do you Lucky Doshi
take Kamini Sandhu..

41
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,434
..as your lawfully wedded wife?

42
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,967
l do. - Do you Kamini Sandhu
take Lucky Doshi..

43
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,502
..to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

44
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,167
l do.

45
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:21,901
l now pronounce you man and wife.

46
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:23,300
You may now kiss the bride.

47
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:25,633
My wabbit.

48
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,967
My pumpkin.

49
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,634
My tweeny.
- My love.

50
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:30,633
Stop!

51
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,233
Brother?

52
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
Brother.

53
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:48,966
Why?

54
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,233
Because l love her.

55
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:58,302
Do you know what love is?

56
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,100
Brother.
- What?

57
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,167
Love will clip your wings.

58
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,901
You won't be able to fly.
It will make your life hell.

59
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,634
Kamini is not like that, brother.

60
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,434
She's a girl, isn't she?
- Yes.

61
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,902
That's it. She is like that.

62
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
''Don't want to love.''

63
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:19,967
You forgot me because of her?

64
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,233
You didn't even think about me?

65
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:24,567
''Don't need to love.''
- Brother..

66
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,567
..you don't think before you love.

67
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:27,966
You just fall in love.

68
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Here we go again.

69
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:34,303
But l never forgot that you
are my guru. My everything.

70
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,436
But you can't be my wife.

71
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,101
What?
- Brother, love.

72
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:43,567
l can't have children with you.

73
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,901
Why do you need to get married?

74
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,301
Why these
complications in this simple life?

75
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,634
Lucky you know our job is such..

76
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:54,502
..that if we get married,
they will do the stunts..

77
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:55,900
..with our hearts and our minds.

78
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:57,966
What is it?

79
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:00,367
Hey.

80
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,235
Are you happy with her?
- Yes.

81
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:07,633
All right.

82
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:12,571
You've made a mistake.
l hope you don't regret it.

83
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:14,967
Father, you can say
whatever you want to.

84
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:16,567
You may now kiss the bride.

85
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,168
Brother..
- Not me. Kiss her.

86
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Stop!

87
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,166
Bebo?

88
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:31,236
''Bebo.. Bebo..''

89
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,367
Bebo?

90
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,635
''Bebo.. Bebo..''

91
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,035
Bebo? - Brother, who is Bebo?
- How would l know?

92
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:41,636
''Bebo.. Bebo..''

93
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,233
Are you out of your mind?

94
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:48,369
Why? - You've destroyed
your life by getting married.

95
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,900
What will happen to you now?

96
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:52,634
What will happen to your career?

97
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,033
What career?

98
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,434
l'm just a lingerie model.

99
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:57,300
That's also a career.

100
00:08:57,966 --> 00:08:59,967
That's it. You are married.
Now forget about modelling.

101
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:04,235
Within days you'll get pregnant.
And then kids.

102
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:07,433
Really?

103
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:09,366
Lucky!

104
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:15,170
lf you are so fond of
marriage and kids, then do it.

105
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:18,434
But why him?

106
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
What?
- What?

107
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:22,435
l mean, if you can get originals..

108
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,435
..then why are you getting
married to this duplicate?

109
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,637
When you can have any man,
why marry this cheap imitation?

110
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:31,300
What?
- A body double?

111
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:33,901
Time out! Excuse me!

112
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:35,566
Why should l?

113
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:37,967
Miss.. Why am l giving
you so much respect?

114
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,101
You! Are you here to
break up their marriage?

115
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,967
Or to insult us stuntmen?

116
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:45,569
Why should l insult those who
are an insult in themselves?

117
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:46,967
What do you know about stuntmen?

118
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:49,101
Who wants to know about you?

119
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:52,235
Second-hand people
with second-hand lives.

120
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,300
Second-hand?

121
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:56,568
We do everything in real,
not those heroes.

122
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,968
We have the guts. We're fearless,
we are honest.

123
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,100
We have integrity.

124
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,036
You've learnt a couple of
English words living in Hollywood.

125
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,634
You uneducated, filthy lout!

126
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:08,168
Shut up you stuck up,
uptight little witch.

127
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:11,101
l know how to shut up
girls like you.

128
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:12,900
Oh, yes?
- Want to bet?

129
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:14,300
Really? Fine.

130
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,566
How?

131
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,567
Let me see what you can do.

132
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,033
Beat me? Hit me?

133
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,501
That's what you guys know?

134
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,034
You can't shut me up.

135
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,569
Today, l will speak
what l think about you.

136
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:26,301
About your friend.

137
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:28,301
And about this thing.

138
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:30,301
And about your community!

139
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,900
You can't shut me up!

140
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,434
We are the ones who got married.
Why are they kissing?

141
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,035
Love your strawberry lipstick, baby.

142
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,166
You..

143
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,566
Don't.

144
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,033
Dog!

145
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Witch.

146
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:59,636
''Wretched love.''

147
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,371
''Wretched love.''

148
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:18,902
''Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

149
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,901
Brother, what are
you doing? Just relax.

150
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:26,301
Brother, you've not
Iearnt anything from me.

151
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:27,967
l've told you
several times that women..

152
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,567
..are good for only two things.

153
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:30,967
There's nothing called love.

154
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,502
All men are
interested in only one thing.

155
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,166
What?

156
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:41,369
Please, Sim. Come to your senses.
You've been mistaken.

157
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:46,303
Lucky has married me,
but hasn't even touched me.

158
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:50,102
Because he knew l didn't
want all that before marriage.

159
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:55,235
When he couldn't do
anything else, as a last resort..

160
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,567
..he got married to you.

161
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:00,168
So you've not done anything yet?

162
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,234
Brother..
- You're still a zero. - Brother..

163
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,567
Score zero-zero?
- Brother..

164
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:04,633
What's wrong with you?

165
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:06,033
Brother, it will happen.
It will happen.

166
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,303
Take this. Protein shake.
l've added Viagra in it.

167
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,433
Viagra?
- Yes.

168
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,901
Brother..

169
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:19,037
Oh, yes. l forgot. You're in love.

170
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:23,904
lt's all about sex.
And l can prove it.

171
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,300
How?

172
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:27,968
Don't let him touch
you for three months.

173
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,034
But Sim, we've got married..

174
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,903
Let's see how long
your marriage lasts.

175
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:36,434
Just test his love.

176
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,903
Sim, you'll see. Lucky's
Iove will top every test.

177
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,635
Brother, you know
nothing about love.

178
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,636
Once you fall in love..
- ..it gets you into trouble.

179
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:55,437
This darned love is like that.
Didn't understand?

180
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,166
Let me explain.

181
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Hey!

182
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:26,902
''Kambakkht.. Kambakkht.''

183
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,970
''Kambakkht Ishq is like that.. ''

184
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:34,970
''Kambakkht Ishq is like that.. ''

185
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:40,304
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

186
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:45,904
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

187
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,636
''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..''

188
00:13:56,966 --> 00:14:00,636
''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..''

189
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,238
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

190
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:11,571
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

191
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,501
''You are doomed.''

192
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,167
''You are doomed.''

193
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,634
''You are doomed.''

194
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,566
''Wretched.''

195
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:39,502
''She intoxicates you with her eyes.''

196
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:43,102
''She invites you with her dark hair.''

197
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,969
''Then she takes you in
her graceful arms..''

198
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,369
''..and leads you to the gallows.''

199
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:53,903
''Wretched.''

200
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:57,970
''First he comes to you..''

201
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:01,569
''..as if begging you to love him.''

202
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:05,436
''And if by mistake
you lose your heart..''

203
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,970
''..he treats it like a football.''

204
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,369
''You must be foolish..''

205
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,902
''..to fall in love.''

206
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,636
''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..''

207
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:23,636
''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..''

208
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:29,237
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

209
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:34,638
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

210
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,501
''You are doomed.''

211
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,434
''You are doomed.''

212
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:58,636
''He says he'll worship you.''

213
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:02,369
''He'll love you forever.''

214
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:06,236
''The first girl he sees..''

215
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,970
''..he changes his mind.''

216
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:13,236
''Kambakkht.. Kambakkht.''

217
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:16,902
''Kambakkht.. Kambakkht.''

218
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:21,103
''She tells you to
bring her the stars.''

219
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,636
''And then she will marry you.''

220
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,503
''Do I own the uniyerse?''

221
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:32,036
''Have l rented a rocket?''

222
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,503
''The one who takes
the wedding vows..''

223
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:38,902
''..is bound to be ruined.''

224
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:42,970
''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..''

225
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:46,970
''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..''

226
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:52,304
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

227
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:57,904
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

228
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:03,171
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

229
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:08,904
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

230
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:14,504
''Once in love, you are doomed.''

231
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,100
''You are doomed.''

232
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,034
''You are doomed.''

233
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,968
''You are doomed.''

234
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:21,634
''You are doomed.''

235
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:24,034
''You are doomed.
- Kambakkht Ishq..''

236
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,437
Oh my God..
- Come on.

237
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,434
No..
- Come on!

238
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,236
Someone hit brother with a bottle.
- Where?

239
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,434
Over there.

240
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,968
Brother!

241
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,300
Who hit me?

242
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,301
Who hit you, brother?
- l don't know.

243
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,900
l'll beat up everybody.

244
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:25,033
Tiger! Tiger!

245
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:28,434
Brother? Brother, sorry.

246
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,301
Brother, no.

247
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,968
Stop. Stop!
- Why are you hitting me?

248
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,633
Hey Stop!

249
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:44,366
Hey Lucky!

250
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:46,366
You!

251
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:00,367
Baby, are you okay?

252
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,034
Baby, what's wrong with you?
- Brother!

253
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,569
Don't support the women!
- Tiger, let me go!

254
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:07,302
My wife is crying. Let go!

255
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,436
Oh, baby! l'm so sorry.

256
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,635
Baby, l can't.. l am so sorry.

257
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:35,300
l'd like to thank the groom.

258
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
And his friends.

259
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:38,966
Sorry.

260
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:43,968
They've done what l couldn't.

261
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:48,970
They've shown Kamini that if
you get married to a stuntman..

262
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:52,970
..you'll get to see all
kinds of stunts everyday.

263
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:58,034
Congratulations, guys.

264
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:10,968
Who threw the cake on
brother's face?

265
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,100
Shut up! Shut up!

266
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:15,500
Look, have l ever
asked you for the cheque?

267
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,967
lt doesn't matter if it's
Iate once in a while, dear.

268
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,967
Okay, bye. l'll call you later.

269
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:24,967
Who were you talking to,
sister Nim?

270
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,967
No, Sim. Nothing important.

271
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
lt was Chunky.

272
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,102
You're absolutely right.
He's nothing important.

273
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:36,302
Bebo.. - How often have
l told you not to call me that?

274
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,034
Anyway, why did he call?

275
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:39,234
l said it was nothing important.

276
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,367
When you were going
through a divorce..

277
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,501
..and you used to come
here and cry all night..

278
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:46,035
..you used to say the same thing,
nothing important.

279
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:49,036
God, Sim. Focus on
positive things sometimes.

280
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:50,968
Nim, what's positive in all this?

281
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,034
You are unhappy. Mom was unhappy.

282
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:56,636
lf there are men involved, then we
have nothing positive left in life.

283
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,100
What should l focus on?

284
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,302
Focus on yourself. And on your life.

285
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,100
Hello, girls.

286
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,100
Hello, Aunt Dolly.

287
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:12,434
You sisters don't
like me at all, do you?

288
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,301
What are you saying?

289
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:15,967
There! Same thing again.

290
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:20,637
When you call me aunt, it
feels like you're abusing me.

291
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,635
Just my name sounds great.

292
00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:26,035
l am alone, and so is my name.

293
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:28,633
You shouldn't say such things.

294
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:31,968
You're not alone. The
two of us are with you.

295
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,434
We're the three musketeers.

296
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,169
Always together. Dolly, Sim and Nim.

297
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,233
Go away!

298
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,967
That's the problem.

299
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:41,301
l don't want to be Raavan,
Kumbhkaran and Vibhishan.

300
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,433
Nim, Sim and Dim.

301
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:46,168
Sim, you're not normal.

302
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:49,902
At your age, you should
have had a four-year-old kid.

303
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,235
lf you want, l can
get pregnant tomorrow.

304
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:55,968
Oh! Sex is easy.

305
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:58,635
But who will get you married?
Your aunt?

306
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,967
That's the point.

307
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,301
My aunt didn't marry,
so why should l?

308
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:04,234
Your aunt didn't marry
because of you.

309
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,969
l was getting good proposals
and they're still pouring in.

310
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,301
Kapoor has proposed me twice.

311
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,102
And he got divorced twice as well.

312
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,035
Wretch! If you don't want
to get married, then don't.

313
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,035
But why are you casting an
evil eye on my marriage?

314
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:18,967
l'm still hopeful.

315
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Well, forget it.

316
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:24,503
Look what gift l've brought for you.

317
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:26,633
Oh, no!

318
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:28,500
Look what l've brought for you.

319
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,967
'Whenever Aunt Dolly
brings something.# 

320
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,301
'..she brings me some new trouble# 

321
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,169
Look what l've brought for you.
- 'Oh, God!'

322
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:40,969
'Aunt Dolly's gift is
equal to terrible problem# 

323
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,034
Look what l've brought for you.

324
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,967
lt's a drape for the wedding gift.

325
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,636
lt will prove very lucky for you.
You'll get a proposal in a jiffy.

326
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,634
Proposal? The same thing again?

327
00:22:57,966 --> 00:22:59,300
l said l don't want to get married.

328
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:02,902
All right, so don't. It's Goddess'
gift. You shouldn't refuse it.

329
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,968
lf not a wedding proposal,
it will prove lucky..

330
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:06,634
..in your desire to be a surgeon.

331
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,168
My name should be
in the next roster.

332
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,568
They say that l just need to
assist in one more surgery.

333
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:18,634
Then l'll be a surgeon. Thank you.

334
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,969
For surgery?
- Are you crazy?

335
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,969
America, land of opportunities.

336
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:35,967
How much for a hotdog?
- Two dollars.

337
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:37,567
One, please.
- All right.

338
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Yes.
- Thank you.

339
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,569
What?
- Needle!

340
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:51,235
This should be in the
haystack not in the hotdog.

341
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:53,901
First you bill me,
then you want to kill me?

342
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,034
You want to be Keswani killer.
- No. No.

343
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:57,968
Take it easy, buddy.
Nobody's trying to kill you. No. No.

344
00:23:58,033 --> 00:23:59,100
What no?

345
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:02,636
You know, you put a needle in
the hotdog. l'll sue you. - No..

346
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,169
You'll be sued. l will sue you.

347
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:07,635
There's no bigger
litigator in all of America.

348
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,967
This has never happened before.

349
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:10,634
l have never died before.

350
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:13,034
Death and shit wait for no one..

351
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,569
..they come anywhere, anytime.

352
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:17,234
Sir..
- Needle in the hotdog! - No. No.

353
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:18,968
He wants to kill me.
- It's all right.- What?

354
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:21,301
Why?
- l'll give you the hotdog for free.

355
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:23,634
Free hotdog? You're joking with me?

356
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,568
Free hotdog for one life.

- Okay. Okay.

358
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,502
Whatever you want. Just
don't sue me okay. - You promise?

359
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:33,101
l promise. - Hold this. -
Just don't sue me, okay?

360
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,967
Stand here.
- What? - Stand here now.

361
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:36,300
Come on, smile. Smile.

362
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,901
Say needle.

363
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,102
Hey Jack. Italy?

364
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:52,502
Well, no thanks. l'm not
taking up any more assignments.

365
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,301
l just did that to
pay up for med school.

366
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,501
But thanks anyway. Bye.

367
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,633
Aunt Dolly!

368
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:42,968
Hello, Keswani here.
Jhoothlani there?

369
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:48,103
Hello Jhoothlani. Coincidentally
l met with an accident.

370
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:49,901
God is great.

371
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:55,636
What yes? Do l pay you to
agree with me all the time?

372
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,134
You've been my
Iawyer for so many years.

373
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,301
You still haven't understood me?

374
00:25:58,966 --> 00:26:04,037
Keswani has got a case for you. Yes..

375
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:07,969
This is really a
Iand of opportunities.

376
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,901
God bless America.

377
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:15,434
Do you know Sarah made it
to the list?

378
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,634
Hi.
- Hi.

379
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,435
Have you seen Dr. Ali anywhere?
- No.

380
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:23,234
Speak of the devil.
- And the devil appears.

381
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:26,168
Congratulations Ali.
You made it to the list. - Yes.

382
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:27,233
Your first surgery.

383
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,967
Thank you.

384
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:32,035
And l'm sure your name will
also be there in the next list.

385
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:34,969
And then you too
will be surgeon. Right?

386
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,169
Step on it! Buck up!
Buck up! Hurry up!

387
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:40,268
What's this? You're trying
to get more fees by delaying.

388
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,368
l understand all this exploitation.

389
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:43,567
There are so many needles in my body.

390
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:44,633
Are you going to make
a tattoo on me?

391
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:46,033
When will you operate on me?

392
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,635
ln a few minutes we'll
give you local an aesthesia.

393
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,968
And then we'll shift you
to the operation theatre.

394
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:55,036
Local? Why local? Why not imported?

395
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:57,968
Such discrimination? l
understand everything.

396
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:00,901
There's one more thing. Don't mind.

397
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:02,967
You're going to
operate on my stomach..

398
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:04,968
..then why don't you
remove my appendix as well?

399
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:07,033
lt's right next to it.

400
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:10,434
lf something goes wrong,
we'll adjust among ourselves.

401
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:13,235
You scratch my backside,
l'll scratch yours.

402
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,300
Do you get me? Mr..

403
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:16,967
lt's not mister. It's Dr. Ali.

404
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:23,571
Doctor? Don't mind. You look
more of a nurse than a doctor.

405
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:26,969
Excuse me! - As it is, l don't
get along well with doctors.

406
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:28,634
You know what l mean?

407
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:33,170
When l was born, l didn't cry,
but the doctor did.

408
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:35,101
Ask me why?
- Why?

409
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:39,103
The doctor held me upside down and
slapped me twice on my backside.

410
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:42,102
Dad scolded him for
hitting his child and sued him.

411
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:44,433
Analyse this.

412
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,970
The one who doesn't pee on
being born but sues the doctor..

413
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,034
..will become a big litigator.

414
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,968
Where are you going? Hello!

415
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,034
Nurse! Oh my God.

416
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,233
Miss!

417
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:01,300
Your clothes.

418
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:04,301
My towel?
- To hell with you!

419
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:06,566
Take it.

420
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:09,568
Lucky, you've come after a week.

421
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:11,033
Want some breakfast?

422
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:14,033
What happened to her?

423
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:15,100
Whom?

424
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:17,634
The girl who just left.

425
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:19,100
What did she do?

426
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,967
Yes brother, at last night's party..

427
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,636
..l thought the girl
was sweet and innocent.

428
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,369
lnnocent? Did you say innocent?

429
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:29,366
Are you crazy?

430
00:28:29,966 --> 00:28:32,635
You should hear her talk.
She's so abusive.

431
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:34,968
Her sentence starts
with the 'F' word.

432
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:36,967
There's the 'F' word
in every sentence.

433
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:38,033
Brother..
- Not that word.

434
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,634
F for future.

435
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,967
She talks of the future
all the time.

436
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,968
Our future. Your future.

437
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:44,434
We'll do this in future.

438
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,034
We'll do that in future, darling.

439
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,902
l am fed up. And to
whom am l telling this?

440
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,968
The one who has
destroyed his future by marrying.

441
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:57,036
Tell me, how is sister-in-law?
That Kamini.

442
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:00,567
''l am a bad boy.''

443
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,901
l haven't touched her
since marriage.

444
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,968
So will your wife allow you to
touch her at an auspicious time?

445
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:07,900
No, brother.

446
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:12,303
l think sister-in-law is
suffering from touch disease.

447
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:15,034
Not touch, she has been possessed.

448
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:16,967
Simrita has possessed her.

449
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:21,103
Simrita has told her that if
l love her, l will not touch her.

450
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:23,634
And according to Simrita,
l don't love her.

451
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:24,966
So l will touch her.

452
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:28,969
So, my lovely, hot,
dumb wife has decided..

453
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,235
..that we have to prove
Simrita wrong.

454
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:39,970
l am losing out.
What do l do? She is so hot!

455
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:50,034
She tempts me all the time.

456
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:53,967
And then she disappoints me.

457
00:29:58,033 --> 00:29:59,567
Brother, poor Lucky.

458
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,300
Brother, l'm driving.

459
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:13,567
That frigid babe.

460
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:16,033
There's no action in her life..

461
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:17,968
..and she doesn't allow
others to get into action.

462
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,201
Brother, how do you know
there's not action in her life?

463
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:22,034
l know such girls very well.

464
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:26,102
They look hot, but
are cold from inside.

465
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,568
But my wife is a sizzler.
She's so hot!

466
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:30,634
l can't see anything
else but her. What can l do?

467
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,436
Be a man.
- What do you mean?

468
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,634
She is playing games with you.

469
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,968
So give her something to play with.

470
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,100
Give here a toy.

471
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,233
Give her a toy.
- Toy? - Yes.

472
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,035
Make her pregnant. Give her a child.

473
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:43,167
She'll play with it all her life.

474
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,300
Brother, you're joking, right?

475
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:45,433
She doesn't allow me
to get close to her..

476
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,567
..and you're saying l
should make her pregnant?

477
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:47,967
This is my life, not a
mythological episode..

478
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:50,034
..in which l can look at a
girl and make her pregnant.

479
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:53,636
Don't worry. Pray to God.
He'll give it to you in a jiffy.

480
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
This is his.

481
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,301
What's this?
- God gave it to me.

482
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:05,901
Oh, my God!

483
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,967
Move it! Move it!

484
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:10,901
Come on. Bring him.

485
00:31:11,966 --> 00:31:12,966
What happened to him?

486
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:17,634
lt's a case of milk-o-magnesia.

487
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:22,637
Because of an accident he
has lost his memory. - What?

488
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,170
Don't you know what
amnesia is? Are you illiterate?

489
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:30,636
Memory? Where am l?
Don't you watch movies?

490
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,035
Who am l, sister?

491
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,634
Sister?
- Aren't you shocked?

492
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:37,501
Now he will go up.
- No!

493
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,634
He'll not go to heaven.
He'll go upstairs, to his room.

494
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:44,035
The more you love him, the
closer he'll get to you.

495
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:47,302
Look, as soon as he saw you,
he smiled at you.

496
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:50,167
Come on..
- Go on. Go on.

497
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:52,101
Give him love therapy. Go on.
- My baby.

498
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,369
Give him love therapy. Go closer.
- My wabbit.

499
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:56,900
My pumpkin.

500
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,034
My tweeny.

501
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:01,168
My sister.

502
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:04,233
No!

503
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,034
Are you crazy? Why are you shouting?

504
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:09,968
Lower you voice. No! No!

505
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,568
He has lost his memory.
He has not gone deaf.

506
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:15,634
No. No.
- Sorry.

507
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:19,569
Okay. Do this. Pick
him up and take him.

508
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:20,966
Gently!

509
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:24,034
Remove his clothes.
Remove his pyjamas..

510
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:27,636
..and find your husband.
He'll be there somewhere.

511
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,901
Come on. Let's go.

512
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:32,434
Doctor?
- Doctor.

513
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:36,435
Yes. Little. Dolittle.

514
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:38,966
Dr. Dolittle.

515
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:40,966
Which hospital?

516
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:43,635
Hospital.. Hospital Universal.

517
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,368
And why are you here?

518
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,970
Yes, Lucky. He lost
his memory. Amnesia.

519
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:54,500
To solve his problem.

520
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:57,035
What have you
prescribed to him, doctor?

521
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,969
One Paramount injection
with Miramax mixed together..

522
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:03,968
..and amnesia is solved.

523
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,503
Then you must have got your medical
degree from Columbia Tristar.

524
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,501
''Bebo..''

525
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:12,968
Brother, shall we remove the wigs?

526
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:23,635
Wouldn't stuntmen become
heroes if they knew acting?

527
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:25,233
All fake.

528
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,967
All men are the same.

529
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:30,502
Cheats, liars, zero
moral fibre, low IQ..

530
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,968
You want to see how
Iow a stuntman can get?

531
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:37,368
Kamini, l've not come
here to get insulted.

532
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,101
Then are you here to insult people?

533
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:42,968
''Wretched love.''

534
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:45,969
Sim! Sim, please.
- ''Wretched love.''

535
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:51,100
Baby. Baby!

536
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:54,633
Brother..

537
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:57,233
Forget whatever happened.

538
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,636
Because believe it or not,
we're going to Italiano.

539
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:02,967
You must have heard the saying.
- Which?

540
00:34:03,966 --> 00:34:05,967
When in Rome, do the Romans.

541
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:09,569
Just imagine. You and me in Milano.

542
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,235
Brother, me too.
- Yes, you too.

543
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:17,503
The ramps there, and tall
eight-foot girls doing the catwalk.

544
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:18,566
Their legs reach up to here.

545
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:20,100
Supermodels.

546
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:24,169
With their soft sleek hands,
they will feed us pasta.

547
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:26,301
Brother, pasta with mozzarella?
- Absolutely, with mozzarella.

548
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:27,967
Let's go then.
- Yes, come on. - Lucky!

549
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,967
Brother, you can go.
- No. Come with me.

550
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:31,100
No, brother. You can go.
- Come on.

551
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,968
Come on. Cancel his tickets.
- Okay.

552
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,167
Sim, isn't it an irony?

553
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:37,968
Do the surgery, and then
collect money for the surgery.

554
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,101
Money?
- Yes, don't you know?

555
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:43,034
_5000 for the registration?

556
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:46,102
You have to give it before the
first surgery. l've received a memo.

557
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,166
5000 dollars.

558
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:49,901
Ali.
- Yes.

559
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:53,034
l just remembered. l have to
make an important phone call.

560
00:34:53,566 --> 00:34:55,034
We'll catch up later. Okay?
- All right.

561
00:34:57,433 --> 00:35:02,971
Hey Jack. That Italian job?
Is that still on?

562
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:07,368
Great! l'll be there.

563
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:08,966
Thanks.

564
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,333
Hi Jack!

565
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Oh my God.

566
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,902
Hi Tiger.
- Jack, hi.

567
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:25,100
Sit, brother.

568
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:28,634
What the heck!
- Sorry, man.

569
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,633
You?
- Yes, me.

570
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,367
What are you doing
in business class?

571
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:38,433
Show me your boarding card.

572
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:40,033
''Don't need to love.''

573
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:41,968
Bank balance, credit card,
property papers, grocery bills..

574
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:43,968
..would you like to check all these?

575
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:45,033
They're all up there.

576
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:47,634
''Don't want to love.''

577
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:49,300
Excuse me.
- Miss, please, take your seat.

578
00:35:49,366 --> 00:35:50,366
We're about to take off.

579
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,502
Come on, sit. You'll
fall down. Hurry. Come on.

580
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,968
What happened, ma'am?
Didn't you take a bath?

581
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:28,100
Excuse me.
- Yes.

582
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,500
Can l please change my seat?

583
00:36:29,566 --> 00:36:31,367
Certainly, miss. Let
me check it for you.

584
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:33,433
Seat 2B is free.

585
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,102
Hi. Can you just tell me
where can l go and sit?

586
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,367
l don't want to sit here any longer.

587
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:44,500
Of course, sir.

588
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:45,566
You take that seat there.

589
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:48,034
That one?
- Yes. - Thank you.

590
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:30,966
Can l help you, sir?

591
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,568
Please, can you get
rid of her? Please.

592
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:36,901
Excuse me, ma'am.

593
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,901
You appear to be
disturbing your co-passenger.

594
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:42,966
Sorry.

595
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,166
You?

596
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,301
Why are you following me?

597
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:54,035
lf l were following you, l'd
have had to take the window seat..

598
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:56,168
..by climbing over you like this.

599
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,169
Had l come like this,
you would have felt it.

600
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:04,104
Good or bad, you would
have surely felt something.

601
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:08,234
Be quiet and don't disturb anybody.

602
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Sorry about her.

603
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:18,234
Dog.
- Witch.

604
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,968
''Wretched love.''

605
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:23,502
''Wretched love.''

606
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:47,033
Cut!

607
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,968
Put that in the can!

608
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:51,101
What will it take
for you to get down?

609
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,168
Belisimo! Great reaction.

610
00:38:58,233 --> 00:38:59,968
You like it?
- Yes. Sure.

611
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:01,100
Why don't you call
the female model now?

612
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:03,234
Okay, l'll call. Come on. Nice.

613
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,166
Brother!

614
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:10,067
Money.
- l know what you're talking about.

615
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:11,200
Excuse me.

616
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,900
What?
- This is the model?

617
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:15,633
You?

618
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:17,100
What are you doing here?

619
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:19,968
So darling,
like l told you earlier..

620
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:24,904
..you'd be sitting behind
him and move yourself forward.

621
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,368
And get close to him. Okay?

622
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,469
As l call 'Action', feel the love.

623
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,100
Feel the love.

624
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:33,166
''Don't want to love.''

625
00:39:34,366 --> 00:39:35,366
''Don't need to love.''

626
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,903
Ma'am, have you come to
Italy to die? - What?

627
00:39:40,966 --> 00:39:42,567
No, l mean, l have no objections.

628
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,468
lt's just that the
bike is not insured.

629
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:47,233
What?

630
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,902
Hold on tight, if you
don't want to fall off.

631
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:55,337
And like the director
has said, feel the love.

632
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:05,467
''Feel the love..''

633
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:07,568
''Feel the love..''

634
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,400
''Feel the love..''

635
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,068
''Feel the love.''

636
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:20,101
''Feel the love.''

637
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,500
''Feel the love.''

638
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,501
''Feel the love.''

639
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,300
Cut!

640
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:30,434
What will it take
for you to get down?

641
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,169
Superb! Superb! Great shot!

642
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,101
Now let's get the real hero.

643
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:47,569
God, originals are
just so much better.

644
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:51,968
''Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

645
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:56,168
''Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

646
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:02,033
l'll just be there.

647
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:05,903
Sim, this is Alexandra. Your type.

648
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,301
Excuse me?
- You like girls, don't you?

649
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
What?

650
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:13,969
You like girls, so l thought..
- Why did you even try to think?

651
00:41:14,966 --> 00:41:16,033
lt doesn't suit you.

652
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,302
Listen to me.
- What's your problem?

653
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,034
l don't have a problem, you do

654
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:22,100
You have a problem with men.

655
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,969
l have a problem with you.
- With me?

656
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:27,033
What's wrong with me?

657
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:29,634
l am hot. l am good in bed.

658
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:33,470
And l've not done anything to you.
- And you never will.

659
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,368
You're not so lucky.

660
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:36,567
Listen you creep!

661
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:42,637
l have no interest in you,
any other man or any woman.

662
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:46,235
Wow! No action!

663
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:50,368
l'll die before l let a
guy like you touch me, okay?

664
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,567
Such attitude? Such attitude!

665
00:41:53,633 --> 00:41:56,635
l think you'll die before
anything does happen to you.

666
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:57,901
Hey!

667
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,167
''Such attitude..''

668
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:43,566
''Come on.''

669
00:42:56,966 --> 00:43:00,169
''Stop throwing your tantrums.''

670
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,569
''Your tricks won't affect me.''

671
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:07,269
''Stop throwing your tantrums.''

672
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:10,635
''Your tricks won't affect me.''

673
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:14,103
''Hey, beautiful one.''

674
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:18,103
''Hey, beautiful one.''

675
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:36,170
''Where are you going
with your Prada bag?''

676
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:43,169
''Whose heart are you going
to crush under your heels?''

677
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:50,369
''Where are you going
with your Prada bag?''

678
00:43:50,433 --> 00:43:53,302
''Whose heart are you going
to crush under your heels?''

679
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:55,301
''The sparkle in your eyes.''

680
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,067
''The sway of your waist.''

681
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:58,968
''The sparkle in your eyes.''

682
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:00,634
''The sway of your waist.''

683
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:04,103
''They try to entice me.''

684
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,969
''Stop throwing your tantrums.''

685
00:44:08,033 --> 00:44:11,035
''Your tricks won't affect me.''

686
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:14,570
''Hey, beautiful one.''

687
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:18,436
''Hey, beautiful one.''

688
00:44:47,966 --> 00:44:51,269
''You can't control your anger.''

689
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:54,569
''You can't control your anger.''

690
00:44:54,966 --> 00:44:58,302
''That's why you need
a rogue like me.''

691
00:44:58,366 --> 00:45:01,969
''That's why you need
a rogue like me.''

692
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:05,436
''You can't control your anger.''

693
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,369
''That's why you need
a rogue like me.''

694
00:45:08,433 --> 00:45:10,334
''You're not so beautiful.''

695
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,968
''You're not even worthy of me.''

696
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:13,968
''You're not so beautiful.''

697
00:45:14,033 --> 00:45:15,634
''You're not even worthy of me.''

698
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,236
''l'm putting up with
you for no reason.''

699
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,103
''Stop throwing your tantrums.''

700
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:26,102
''Your tricks won't affect me.''

701
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:29,636
''Hey, beautiful one.''

702
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:33,303
''Hey, beautiful one.''

703
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:36,635
''Hey, beautiful one.''

704
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:40,904
''Hey, beautiful one.''

705

''Hi, bftby!''

706
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,504

00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:20,169
''Bebo.. Bebo.''

708
00:46:22,433 --> 00:46:26,637
''Bebo.. Bebo.''

709
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:31,900
Excuse me?
- Yes.

710
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:34,902
The Asian guy at the back
in the superman T-shirt?

711
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,367
Yes.

712
00:46:38,433 --> 00:46:39,433
He is carrying drugs.

713
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:40,966
Are you sure?

714
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,300
Rico!

715
00:46:46,966 --> 00:46:48,634
''Hi, bftby!''

716
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:51,634
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

717
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:55,035
You've been randomly selected
for a private security search.

00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:56,100
l hope you understand.

719
00:46:57,033 --> 00:46:58,501
Yes, l do understand.

720
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:00,033
Okay, could you please follow me?
- Sure.

721
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:01,434
Brother, what an
amazing understanding?

722
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,634
lt's nothing like that.

723
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,235
Right this way.
- She called me to a room alone.

724
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,102
No. No. You wait. This is your
friend's private search. - Okay.

725
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:14,100
l'm Waiting.

726
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:19,967
Where's the bed? Wow!

727
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:22,534
lt's always good on the table.

728
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:24,166
Check me.

729
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:35,901
Who is she?

730
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:44,366
Very fast.

731
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:55,169
No! No! No!

732
00:47:55,966 --> 00:47:58,635
Control, brother.
It's a public place.

733
00:47:58,699 --> 00:47:59,967
''Wftnnft get down!''

734
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:07,901
No! No!

735
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,368
Brother, you can be heard outside.

736

737
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:16,200
No!

00:48:17,966 --> 00:48:22,437
You got drugs. l will find them.
- No! No!

739
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:25,033
Scream!

740
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:29,504
Stop it. Stop it. - Brother,
keep at it. l'll get the car.

741
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:53,633
What happened to you?

742
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:55,168
What's your problem, woman?
Do your work.

743
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:58,002
A^^hole!
- Yes, that's the problem.

744
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:00,300
''Hi baby.''

745
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:04,269
''Bebo.. Bebo.''

746
00:49:04,966 --> 00:49:07,968
''Bebo.. Bebo.''

747
00:49:08,433 --> 00:49:10,902
F^^k you.

748
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,168
''Bebo.. Bebo.''

749
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:15,434
''Bebo.. Bebo.''

750
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,634
What happened to you, brother?

751
00:49:19,966 --> 00:49:20,966
Why are you limping?

752
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:24,033
Take this.

753
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,567
What happened to you brother?
Why are you limping?

754
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:29,634
l got it.
- Come on. Hurry up.

755
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,133
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

756
00:49:32,266 --> 00:49:33,533
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

757
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,901
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

758
00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:38,100
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

759
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,434
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

760
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:45,503
''Supreme lord Vishnu
is the holiest one.''

761
00:49:45,966 --> 00:49:50,103
''Son of the Raghu
dynasty is the holiest one.''

762
00:49:50,566 --> 00:49:54,636
''Supreme lord Vishnu
is the holiest one.''

763
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:59,237
''Son of the Raghu
dynasty is the holiest one.''

764
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:02,101
What's this mantra?
Isn't it the Marriage mantra?

765
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,166
What nonsense!

766
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:08,035
Why don't you wear it?
It will suit you better.

767
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:11,570
l can't help it. l'm in the
habit of thinking about you first.

768
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,968
Not me..

769
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:17,569
..at least fear God. You
should never refuse holy gifts.

770
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:20,369
God doesn't want me to
get married, but you do.

771
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:22,034
l didn't say it is for your wedding.

772
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:24,168
lt is God's blessing.
It is for your welfare.

773
00:50:24,566 --> 00:50:26,434
lt could also help you
in becoming a surgeon.

774
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,300
Just wear it.

775
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:32,568
As it is, you don't
believe in such superstitions.

776
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:34,634
lt doesn't make a difference to you.

777
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:36,434
lt's just a watch for you.

778
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,636
''My heart beats every moment.''

779
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:43,634
''lt beats, but why
does it beat so fast?''

780
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:46,436
'God, l don't know
what's going to happen'

781
00:50:50,966 --> 00:50:52,901
Man, once in a while
try to look happy

782
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:56,068
You're always with this
Iong face. C'mon, Be happy.

783
00:50:57,366 --> 00:50:58,567
l should have a reason to be happy.

784
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,901
Earlier, Kamini
didn't let me come close.

785
00:51:01,233 --> 00:51:02,634
But at least she loved me.

786
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:05,969
After the memory loss prank,
she doesn't even look at me.

787
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:07,901
l sit right in front of her,
but she doesn't even look at me.

788
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:13,503
Hi Viraj! - That's because you
don't know how to treat a girl.

789
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:15,166
Get it?

790
00:51:15,633 --> 00:51:18,902
Girls are special, delicate
little creatures. - Viraj.

791
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,168
Treat them with love.
- Viraj.

792
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:23,435
And they will run after you.
- Wait.

793
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,567
And be a man.
- Viraj.

794
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:28,069
Remember, be a man and they
will fall for you like this.

795
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,300
Where's your phone?

796
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,367
Hello.

797
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:46,567
Hi, is Lucky there?

798
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:48,633
Who is this?

799
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:51,903
'This is Jackie. And you
must be his sister Kamini# 

800
00:51:52,966 --> 00:51:55,368
'Lucky told me l'm going to
get lucky tonight at the club# 

801
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:57,033
What?

802
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:07,168
Hello. Simrita.

803
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:15,633
Excuse me.

804
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:20,033
What kind of place is this?

805
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:21,634
Why? It's not nice?

806
00:52:21,699 --> 00:52:22,901
This place is sleazy.

807
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,901
Jackie, this is our brother.

808
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,300
And..
- Hi.

809
00:52:27,366 --> 00:52:29,634
lt's not me. It's him.
You carry on drinking

810
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:34,368
Didn't you tell her that
she has to flirt with him?

811
00:52:34,433 --> 00:52:35,500
Don't worry, brother.

812
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:37,034
She'll be all over him as
soon as sister-in-law comes.

813
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:38,167
But does she know to act?

814
00:52:38,566 --> 00:52:40,034
l won't be able to do
anything in front of Kamini.

815
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:42,035
She has to do everything. Brother,
l.. - Don't worry.

816
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:46,036
She's an actress from
the union. She'll be good.

817
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:47,968
Brother, she's not from the union.

818
00:52:48,033 --> 00:52:49,634
The one from the
union was asking for $OO.

819
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,034
l picked her from the street for $O.

820
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:52,367
Just to save money.
- What?

821
00:52:52,433 --> 00:52:53,567
She's probably run
up a bill worth $OO.

822
00:52:57,033 --> 00:53:00,503
Are you okay?
- Yes, l'm fine.

823
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:05,233
Brother, she threw up on me.

824
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:10,169
Go wash it. Just take her away.
Go on.

825
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:11,966
Just go.

826
00:53:14,366 --> 00:53:15,366
What kind of girl have you got?

827
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:17,634
For $O dollars what do you expect?

828
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,500
Are you okay?

829
00:53:24,633 --> 00:53:25,633
Okay, there.

830
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,635
''Lucky..''

831
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:31,301
''Lucky..''

832
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:44,467
Don't you think this
place is a bit sleazy?

833
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,300
What do you expect?

834
00:53:46,633 --> 00:53:49,302
Where else would
your husband hang out?

835
00:53:52,033 --> 00:53:55,569
Look Sim, whatever happens,
my Lucky is not a bad guy.

836
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:57,967
He loves me very much.

837
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:01,635
''Lucky..''

838
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:15,567
He'll not do anything wrong.

839
00:54:16,699 --> 00:54:17,967
He'll not break my heart.

840
00:54:18,966 --> 00:54:20,967
''Lucky..''

841
00:54:24,966 --> 00:54:28,135
Sim, this place is not all that bad.

842
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:30,368
Listen, they are
playing spiritual music.

843
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:32,033
lt's not that bad.

844
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:35,303
This is not spiritual music.
It's Aunt Dolly's gift.

845
00:54:35,633 --> 00:54:37,501
This watch plays
this music every hour.

846
00:54:38,033 --> 00:54:39,234
Police!

847
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,568
Officer, just a minute.

848
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,969
Kamini, you? l..

849
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:03,901
Brother, let me handle this.

850
00:55:04,366 --> 00:55:05,900
Sister-in-law, the thing is..
- Just shut up.

851
00:55:09,233 --> 00:55:12,336
Kamini, it's not what you think.

852
00:55:12,966 --> 00:55:15,635
lt's just that.. l was here..

853
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:26,968
Since Mr. Doshi
doesn't want a divorce..

854
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,568
..and Mrs. Doshi doesn't have
any clear grounds for seeking it..

855
00:55:31,433 --> 00:55:33,968
..l give you three month's time
to reconcile your differences..

856
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:35,367
..and also recommend counseling.

857
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:38,100
Case adjourned.

858
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:39,900
Brother, Lucky.

859
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,334
Everything is over, brother.
- Nothing is over.

860
00:55:47,033 --> 00:55:48,968
The court has given
you three months, right?

861
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:50,901
The divorce will happen if
there is no reconciliation.

862
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:55,103
l'll talk to Kamini. l'll
tell her that it was my fault

863
00:55:55,533 --> 00:55:56,967
l will take the blame
for everything.

864
00:55:57,966 --> 00:55:59,067
Don't worry.

865
00:55:59,133 --> 00:56:00,234
Your elder brother is still here.

866
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:03,634
Kamini.. Kamini, listen to me.

867
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:06,367
Listen to me. Listen..

868
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:09,302
Why are we ruining their
lives because of our egos?

869
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,901
Please understand. Lucky
Ioves Kamini very much.

870
00:56:12,466 --> 00:56:14,034
Please forget the past.

871
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:17,235
You're her best friend. Just try
to be a little more understanding

872
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,635
Please listen to me.
Please, try to understand.

873
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:20,967
Don't be like this.

874
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:22,100
Stop it!

875
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:23,901
Come on. Why are you making
her lose so that you can win?

876
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:25,966
Hey! Hey!

877
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:27,966
Stop being such a witch.

878
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:31,433
l'll stop being a witch..

879
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:34,301
..the day men like
you stop being dogs.

880
00:56:35,966 --> 00:56:37,033
Get out!

881
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:39,168
''Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

882
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,902
The fuel truck will roll down first.
That's the fire stunt.

883
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,068
Now you have gone over this
with the safety guys, right?

884
00:56:49,966 --> 00:56:51,033
Yes.

885
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:52,634
The next shot is the train shot.

886
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:55,001
All the cables and
everything else is setup.

887
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:56,167
lt's a real simple shot.

888
00:57:01,533 --> 00:57:04,335
Lucky..
- Viraj? Viraj, the shot is ready.

889
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:06,067
Come on. Let's start shooting.

890
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:07,967
Give this your best shot, alright?

891
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,634
And action!

892
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:12,901
Through fire.

893
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,600
Move background.

894
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:24,901
Go, fuel truck!

895
00:57:27,966 --> 00:57:28,966
Enter frame!

896
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,267
And move train!

897
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,300
Out of here!

898
00:57:39,566 --> 00:57:40,633
Move! Move!

899
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:41,901
Move from here.

900
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:43,533
Cue to jump.

901
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,400
Jump now!

902
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,133
Brother!

903
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,533
Get the first-aid.

904
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,501
Brother!
- Brother!

905
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,300
Don't worry.
- Brother.

906
00:57:57,533 --> 00:57:58,533
Ambulance!

907
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:00,333
Get an ambulance!

908
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:01,633
Now!

909
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,935
Don't worry. l'll be okay.

910
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:19,001
Yes, brother.
- Lucky. - Open the door.

911
00:58:19,366 --> 00:58:20,366
Tiger.

912
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:22,902
Stop crying. Don't be a wimp tiger.

913
00:58:31,699 --> 00:58:33,902
Congratulations, Sim. Finally!

914
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,166
Nervous?

915
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:37,635
Very. It's a clear
case of intestine rupture.

916
00:58:37,966 --> 00:58:38,966
Should be a simple surgery.

917
00:58:39,566 --> 00:58:40,566
All the best.

918
00:58:41,133 --> 00:58:42,300
Thank you.
- Yes.

919
00:58:43,566 --> 00:58:45,167
Why is this place spinning?

920
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:48,634
Please send me back to Punjab.

921
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:51,301
l want to go to Punjab.

922
00:58:52,966 --> 00:58:55,168
Hello, Mother.

923
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:57,966
Slowly.

924
00:59:04,366 --> 00:59:06,201
You?
- What is she doing here?

925
00:59:06,966 --> 00:59:09,034
Mother, what is she doing here?

926
00:59:09,433 --> 00:59:11,034
She's going to be operating.

927
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:12,968
She'll operate? She's a model.

928
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:16,969
''Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

929
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:18,033
No. She can't operate.

930
00:59:18,566 --> 00:59:20,034
l've not come here for a ramp walk.

931
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:23,302
She can't operate. She
can't even wax properly.

932
00:59:23,566 --> 00:59:26,302
He's just hallucinating
due to pain and anesthesia.

933
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:28,100
How much profile have you given him?

934
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,166
10cc.

935
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,566
Give him 5cc more.

936
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:32,901
No 5cc.

937
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,300
She's going to kill me.

938
00:59:35,433 --> 00:59:36,433
Mother.

939
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,635
She emptied five bottles inside me.

940
00:59:41,566 --> 00:59:43,634
The whole bottle.

941
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,300
Save me.

942
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:53,033
She is a wretch.

943
00:59:54,166 --> 00:59:57,235
No, not her. That's the other one.

944
00:59:57,633 --> 01:00:00,902
She is a witch. Witch.

945
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:05,168
She'll murder me. Stop her.

946
01:00:10,966 --> 01:00:14,569
What are you doing? Making a tunnel?
- Shut up!

947
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:16,500
ls my body your dad's property?

948
01:00:17,966 --> 01:00:20,168
Are you searching
for a way to Dubai?

949
01:00:21,433 --> 01:00:23,902
Come on. Kill me.

950
01:00:24,966 --> 01:00:26,100
Kill me.

951
01:00:27,099 --> 01:00:28,301
You'll go to jail.

952
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:30,433
l will sue you.

953
01:00:30,966 --> 01:00:32,634
Stop preparing this chutney.

954
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,168
l will sue you.

955
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,101
l will become a bikini model.

956
01:00:39,633 --> 01:00:42,035
And l will also become a doctor.

957
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:46,635
l will model for briefs and vests.

958
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:51,103
Thank God. God should save me now.

959
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:54,034
Call my friend..

960
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:58,301
He works in a laundry..

961
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:07,536
Doctor, this is the patient's
report and X-ray. - Thank you.

962
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,968
Where's the patient from 516?

963
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,500
l have no idea.

964
01:02:19,966 --> 01:02:20,966
Viraj!

965
01:02:23,633 --> 01:02:24,633
Run!

966
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,567
Take me and run!

967
01:02:26,633 --> 01:02:28,634
You should have said that.
Come on. Come.

968
01:02:29,266 --> 01:02:31,968
Open the door quickly.
- Where are you going?

970

l'm your doctor.

971
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:38,436
You can't leave this
hospital without my permission.

972
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,968
Did you pay the bill?
- The entire bill.

01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:42,901
Nobody can stop me now.

How can you leave?
- How can l? Watch me.

975
01:02:46,633 --> 01:02:47,633
What?

976
01:02:47,966 --> 01:02:49,534
Hey, don't touch me.

977

l have to check.
l have to watch you.

979
01:02:56,966 --> 01:03:00,235
You've made a hole in my belly.
What else do you want?

980
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:03,167
Viraj, why don't you understand?

981
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:04,233
No you understand.

982
01:03:04,566 --> 01:03:06,968
Had l known that
you'd operate on me..

983
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,368
..l'd have died instead of
allowing you to operate on me.

984
01:03:09,966 --> 01:03:11,167
Just try to touch me.

985
01:03:12,233 --> 01:03:14,234
All my lawyers will sue you.

986
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:19,966
Enough.

987
01:03:20,966 --> 01:03:21,966
Out.

988
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:24,301
''Mangalam.. Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

989
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:26,434
''Mangalam.. Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

990
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,568
''Mangalam.. Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

991
01:03:28,633 --> 01:03:30,634
''Mangalam.. Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

992
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:34,969
''Mangalam.. Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

993
01:03:35,033 --> 01:03:38,970
''Mangalam.. Don't want to love.
Don't need to love.''

994
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,969
''lt's show time.''

995
01:03:43,033 --> 01:03:44,033
''lt's show time.''

01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:47,234
''lt's show time.''

997
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,068
''lt's show time.''

998
01:04:21,966 --> 01:04:23,100
lt's a disgrace.

999
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:25,635
Not just for a hospital,
but for a profession.

1000
01:04:25,966 --> 01:04:27,367
Who was the doctor-in-charge?

1001
01:04:28,233 --> 01:04:31,235
Simrita Rai, you've been
negligent in carrying out..

1002
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,968
..your duties as a doctor..

1003
01:04:33,033 --> 01:04:35,502
..because of your personal
differences with the patient.

1004
01:04:35,966 --> 01:04:38,535
You're hereby barred
from medical practice.

1005
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:42,966
Excuse me..

1006
01:04:44,233 --> 01:04:46,435
Dr. Rai, how could you
be so careless?

1007
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:51,969
Nimrita.. - Why did you put an
innocent man's life in danger..

1008
01:04:52,033 --> 01:04:54,635
..just because of your
personal differences?

1009
01:04:55,566 --> 01:04:58,568
Why did you ruin
your years of hard work?

1010
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:00,900
Why Sim?

1011
01:05:01,966 --> 01:05:04,301
Sister Nim..
- Don't call me sister.

1012
01:05:04,966 --> 01:05:06,901
l can't be your sister.

1013
01:05:09,566 --> 01:05:10,566
Sister Nim!

1014
01:05:15,966 --> 01:05:16,966
Sister Nim?

1015
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,500
What happened?

1016
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:21,301
l was just practicing 'Shavasan'.

1017
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,302
Sorry. l had a bad dream.

1018
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,168
You are doomed.

1019
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:34,368
Do you think l don't know that?

1020
01:05:34,966 --> 01:05:37,501
But what should l do now?
What will happen to me?

1021
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:38,633
You?

1022
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:40,968
What will happen to the one
who has a watch in his stomach?

1023
01:05:41,033 --> 01:05:42,234
Sim, what will happen to him?

1024
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:46,235
lf there is an infection,
he's finished.

1025
01:05:46,966 --> 01:05:49,034
And even if he doesn't,
he'll be in trouble.

1026
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:51,168
He'll be pissing blood.

1027
01:05:51,233 --> 01:05:52,233
He'll be..

1028
01:05:53,566 --> 01:05:55,968
Sim, if the watch
reaches his lower intestine..

1029
01:05:56,033 --> 01:05:58,235
..he won't be able to
pass his stools.

1030
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,969
You'll end up in jail and
your career will be finished.

1031
01:06:01,033 --> 01:06:03,635
Ali! - Not Ali, now only
God can help you.

1032
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:05,635
Even if he survives,
he will sue you.

1033
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:08,235
And you will commit suicide,
you'll hang yourself.

1034
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,435
You are doomed, ruined, finished.

1035
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,235
You're life is..
- Shut up!

1036
01:06:14,566 --> 01:06:15,566
Relax.

1037
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:26,970
''Om Mangalam Mangalam
(''Sanskrit Chants.'').''

1038
01:06:27,966 --> 01:06:31,569
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1039
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,235
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1040
01:06:34,966 --> 01:06:38,502
''Supreme lord Vishnu
is a highest goodness.''

1041
01:06:38,566 --> 01:06:39,633
Are you singing?

1042
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:43,437
''Son of Raghu dynasty
is a highest goodness.''

1043
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:47,904

''Son of Raghu dynasty is a highest
goodness.'' - l won't spare you.

1050
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,034
You lousy neighbour!

1052
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:24,902
Hey, this is a cool neighbourhood.

1053
01:07:25,366 --> 01:07:26,500
Stop playing 'bhajans'
(Hindu hymns).

1054
01:07:30,966 --> 01:07:31,966
Thanks.

1055
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:34,633

''Son of Raghu dynasty

1062
01:08:02,966 --> 01:08:07,036
''Supreme lord Vishnu
is a highest goodness.''

1063
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:11,637
''Son of Raghu dynasty
is a highest goodness.''

1064
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:17,903
Brother! What happened?

1065
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,635
''Supreme lord Vishnu

1066
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:26,101
Can you also hear that noise?

Where is that noise coming from?

1068
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,169
How would l know? You point a finger.
It's coming from there.

1069
01:08:36,966 --> 01:08:37,966
Brother!

1070
01:08:38,966 --> 01:08:40,534
Hey Viraj.
- Yo.

1071
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,302
On action, make sure you get
out of the way quickly, okay?

1072
01:08:43,366 --> 01:08:44,967
Because that water is
going to come really fast.

1073
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:46,634
All right, sir.
- Rolling.

1074
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:49,234
Ready! Standby! And action!

1075
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:55,903
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.
Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1076
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,568
Viraj, get out of the way!

1079
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:11,901

He is a famous doctor.
He has cured Obama too.

1082
01:09:27,633 --> 01:09:29,901
Should a man look at his
wife in such a lustful manner?

1083
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,201
What else can l do
other than just look?

1084
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:35,500
Viraj Shergill.
- Yes.

1085
01:09:44,966 --> 01:09:45,966

Tell me, boy, what can l do for you?

You know, doctor.

l don't you.. l can
hear some mantras and..

1091
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,036
You have to speak up. Why
are you speaking so softly?

1092
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,100
Speak up. Don't worry.

1093
01:10:06,366 --> 01:10:08,901
l don't know what happens
to me. l can hear mantras.

1094
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,901
And after every hour something..

1095
01:10:13,233 --> 01:10:16,903
Nothing. Speak aloud.
Come on, young man.

1096
01:10:18,699 --> 01:10:21,636
A few days ago, l met
with an accident. - What?

1097
01:10:21,966 --> 01:10:23,901
And now l hear
'mantras' (Hindu chants).

01:10:24,466 --> 01:10:27,602
l have gone mad. l can't..

1099
01:10:27,966 --> 01:10:30,435
l hear some 'mantras'. l
don't know what to do..

1100
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,635
Speak up, boy. Speak..
- l am speaking up.

1101
01:10:32,966 --> 01:10:35,301
l hear some 'mantras'.
l have gone mad.

1102
01:10:35,366 --> 01:10:37,501
Oh, my God. We have a problem.

1103
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:40,234
You can't hear. You can't speak.

1104
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,601
You're using your hands too much.

1105
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,234
You have a double complication.

1106
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,235
l don't have any double
complications.

1107
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,168
A few days back, on the film sets.

1108
01:10:47,233 --> 01:10:48,233
Sex?

1109
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:51,635
No. No. Now l understand.
You've come to the wrong place.

1110
01:10:51,966 --> 01:10:54,501
l am an ENT specialist.

1111
01:10:54,566 --> 01:10:56,968
l am not a sex therapist.

1112
01:10:57,033 --> 01:10:58,901
Oh, come on.

1113

You will have to go.
- Okay. Okay, Doctor. Please.

1115
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,970
Doctor, you have to
check me. Check me.

1116
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,502
Sex with me? What
are you talking about?

1117
01:11:11,566 --> 01:11:13,901
Please go. l'm so sorry.
You have to leave.

01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:15,367
Please cover that.
Please cover that.

1119
01:11:15,433 --> 01:11:16,567
l am under a lot of pressure.

1120
01:11:16,633 --> 01:11:17,967
l cannot give you any pleasure.

1121
01:11:18,033 --> 01:11:21,035
Doctor, please..
- Please leave. Please go.

1122
01:11:21,966 --> 01:11:22,966
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1123
01:11:23,433 --> 01:11:25,501
Can you hear it?
- l can't bear it.

1124
01:11:25,566 --> 01:11:27,968
No, doctor. Can you hear it?
- l can't bear it.

1125
01:11:28,433 --> 01:11:31,969
Doctor, do something. Do it.
- Brother, even with men.

1126
01:11:32,366 --> 01:11:34,367
l'm a married man.
l am too confused.

1127
01:11:34,433 --> 01:11:36,301

You help me.

Let's go inside.

1132

Do something. - Brother, let him go.
What happened?

1133
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:46,233
Do something.
- Brother, what happened?

1134
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,968
Brother, what happened?

1135
01:11:48,233 --> 01:11:49,968
Everything has gone
wrong because of this fool.

1136
01:11:50,233 --> 01:11:51,567
What kind of a doctor is he?

1137
01:11:51,633 --> 01:11:54,435
He can neither see nor hear,
and he has cured Obama?

1138
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,635
He can't cure his dog.
- Okay, brother.

1139
01:11:56,966 --> 01:11:59,234
Why are you shouting?
Talk softly. l can hear you.

1140
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:03,034
Can you hear the 'mantra'?
- What 'mantra'?

''Om Mangalam Bhagwan Vishnu.
Om Mangalam..''

1142

Oh, my God! Are you sure?

Oh, it's a miracle! It's a miracle!
- Miracle?

1146
01:12:14,699 --> 01:12:16,968
That's your wedding 'mantra'.
You're going to get married.

done anything wrong.

1222
01:15:43,433 --> 01:15:45,368
Foreign body inside my body?

1223
01:15:47,433 --> 01:15:49,902
My ultimate dream.

1224
01:15:50,966 --> 01:15:51,966
God is great!

1225
01:15:54,033 --> 01:15:57,369
Jackpot!

1226
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:04,969
Kamini?
- Be in your half, please.

1227
01:16:05,033 --> 01:16:07,034
What is all this?
What are you doing?

1228
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:10,303
You know, Lucky.
l should have listened to Sim.

1229
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:14,102
Kamini, l know l've hurt you,
but l'm really sorry.

1230
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:15,166
l really love you.

1231
01:16:15,966 --> 01:16:19,969
But Simrita says..
- She can say anything.

1232
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:21,367
Can't you take your own decisions?

1233
01:16:21,433 --> 01:16:25,036
Sim was right. You stuntmen!
- Witch!

1234
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,968
Kamini, l'm sorry.

1235
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,902
Kamini! Kamini! l'm..

1236
01:16:33,366 --> 01:16:36,302
Whatever it takes, l'll
bring him to the hospital.

1237
01:16:36,566 --> 01:16:38,234
And operate on him.

1238
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:41,036
Why will he come? He hates you.

1239
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,301
And you don't know
his number either.

1240
01:16:42,366 --> 01:16:43,900
No, Simrita, you're doomed.

1241
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,969
l have Lucky's number.
l'll call him.

1242
01:16:47,566 --> 01:16:49,100
Brother, l remember my promise.

1243
01:16:49,433 --> 01:16:52,035
No matter what it takes,
l'll reunite you and Kamini.

1244
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,100
Don't worry.

1245
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,367
lt's futile.

1246
01:16:55,433 --> 01:16:57,902
Kamini is not the problem.
It's Simrita.

1247
01:17:02,966 --> 01:17:04,033
Hello.

1248
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,634
Hi.
- Kamini?

1249
01:17:05,699 --> 01:17:07,501
No. Simrita.

1250
01:17:07,566 --> 01:17:10,035
What? Simrita? Wrong number.

1251
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,168
Lucky! Lucky, listen.

1252
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,635
l want to ask you about Viraj.

1253
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:17,501
Ask what? Whether
brother is alive or dead?

1254
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:19,968
l'm sorry to inform you. l'm
sorry to disappoint you rather..

1255
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:22,368
..brother came back alive
after you operated on him.

1256
01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:24,368
Lucky, why don't you understand?

1257
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:26,100
l am Viraj's doctor.

1258
01:17:26,566 --> 01:17:28,301
l want to do a
post-op check-up on him.

1259
01:17:28,966 --> 01:17:30,367
The stitches have
not been removed yet.

1260
01:17:30,433 --> 01:17:31,967
He could have an infection.

1261
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,102
Oh, God! He could have an infection.

1262
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:38,968
Why is she being such a pain?
- Pain? - Pain?

1263
01:17:39,433 --> 01:17:40,500
Where is it paining?

1264
01:17:40,566 --> 01:17:41,967
Where is the pain?

1265
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:43,434
Why didn't you tell me before?

1266
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,968
Oh, God! 'Shanti' (Peace).

1267
01:17:45,033 --> 01:17:46,033
Hello.

1268
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:47,966
Who is this Shanti?

1269
01:17:48,433 --> 01:17:49,500
Your sister-in-law.

1270
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,168
l thought her name was Simrita.

1271
01:17:52,233 --> 01:17:54,501
Man, tell him to stop.
Else l'll break his legs.

1272
01:17:54,566 --> 01:17:55,900
l swear l will.

1273
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,035
What are you doing, Tiger?
Couldn't you find any other girl?

1274
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,167
Could you only find a girl..

1275
01:18:01,233 --> 01:18:02,901
..who doesn't give
brother any importance?

1276
01:18:04,966 --> 01:18:06,567
What? She doesn't
give me any importance?

1277
01:18:06,966 --> 01:18:08,033
Obviously.

1278
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,502
She doesn't give me any
importance or l don't.

1279
01:18:10,966 --> 01:18:12,967
Come on, brother. l know
all the girls want you..

1280
01:18:13,033 --> 01:18:15,969
..but she's hardcore.

1281
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,301
Even you can't charm her.
She hates you.

1282
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:22,635
You carry on please.
l'll drive her crazy.

1283
01:18:23,566 --> 01:18:25,034
l'll make sure she sleeps with me.

1284
01:18:26,966 --> 01:18:28,967
You're fired. You're fired.

1285
01:18:29,033 --> 01:18:30,968
Hey, pay her. You're fired.
Please go.

1286
01:18:32,566 --> 01:18:34,301
She listens to everything.
- Loser!

1287
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:37,369
Nosy cow!
- Brother, relax.

1288
01:18:42,366 --> 01:18:43,366
And then?

1289
01:18:44,966 --> 01:18:48,636
And then l'll do to
her what she did to you.

1290
01:18:50,966 --> 01:18:55,370
She broke your heart. l'll
break hers after playing with her.

1291
01:18:55,633 --> 01:18:57,167
''l am a bad boy.''

1292
01:19:00,366 --> 01:19:03,302
Seven days.
- Seven days.

1293
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,100
Done.

1294
01:19:06,566 --> 01:19:07,633
What's all this?

1295
01:19:07,699 --> 01:19:08,967
These are flowers, Sim.

1296
01:19:09,633 --> 01:19:11,968
l know that. But for whom?

1297
01:19:15,699 --> 01:19:17,968
'They say every flower
has a meaning# 

1298
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,968
'For example,
happiness, love or friendship# 

1299
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:22,101
'When l think about
you l don't understand.# 

1300
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:24,968
'..which flower l should send you# 

1301
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:27,968
'l thought l'd play it safe.
So l've sent all the flowers# 

1302
01:19:28,033 --> 01:19:29,501
'Viraj#  Viraj?

1303
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,435
Viraj? Who is he?

1304
01:19:33,566 --> 01:19:35,968
Nobody. He's a creep.

1305
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:39,102
Creep? l wish there was
such a creep in my life.

1306
01:19:39,433 --> 01:19:41,168
l'd get such lovely flowers.

1307
01:19:47,966 --> 01:19:49,634
'Today is an important day for me# 

1308
01:19:50,366 --> 01:19:53,969
'On such occasions, it is important
that friends are with you# 

1309
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:15,102
'And to announce the
next category.# 

1310
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:20,438
'..please welcome on stage the
very beautiful Holly Valance# 

1311
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:23,567
Good evening Hollywood.

1312
01:20:23,633 --> 01:20:26,969
Best stunt coordination and
or second unit direction..

1313
01:20:27,033 --> 01:20:30,035
..for best stunts during
an entire film of any genre.

1314
01:20:30,633 --> 01:20:34,636
And the award goes
to Viraj Shergill.

1315
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:44,968
And to give away this award,
l'd like to invite someone..

1316
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:49,370
..who's not only a superstar,
but a legend in the world of action.

1317
01:20:49,966 --> 01:20:51,967
Now, l'm not really
a big fan of his.

1318
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,568
l just happen to know that
his next film is releasing in..

1319
01:20:54,633 --> 01:20:58,103
..eight months, 26 days,
35 minutes and 14 seconds.

1320
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,500
Thirteen seconds.

1321
01:21:05,366 --> 01:21:07,634
Please put your hands
together for the man..

1322
01:21:07,699 --> 01:21:10,369
..the legend,
Mr. Sylvester Stallone.

1323
01:21:23,699 --> 01:21:24,901
Thank you.

1324
01:21:27,699 --> 01:21:28,901
Good evening, everyone.

1325
01:21:29,633 --> 01:21:30,900
My name is John Rambo.

1326
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:38,169
But tonight, ladies and
gentlemen is not about me.

1327
01:21:38,233 --> 01:21:40,234
lt's about the real
heroes behind the action.

1328
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:44,504
And it's my real privilege to
give this award to someone..

1329
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,367
..who is my real life hero.

1330
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:51,237
To the man who takes the fall
as the director yells action.

1331
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,634
And the good looking hero..

1332
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:55,436
..rolls up in the continuity
and dusts himself off and says..

1333
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:57,367
..''l'm your worst nightmare.''

1334
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:03,036
lt's my absolute pleasure
and honour to give this award..

1335
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:06,503
..to a man without whom,
many of my recent films..

1336
01:22:06,566 --> 01:22:07,900
..would have never been
what they are.

1337
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:12,035
The incredible, Viraj Shergill.

1338
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:20,100
Viraj, why don't you
say a few words?

1339
01:22:27,366 --> 01:22:30,902
When l was a young boy in Punjab,
l used to tell my mom..

1340
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:36,170
''Mom, when l grow up, l'd
like to be Sylvester Stallone.''

1341
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:38,300
l can never be Sylvester.

1342
01:22:38,566 --> 01:22:39,633
Nobody can.

1343
01:22:40,699 --> 01:22:43,969
But this middle class Indian boy..

1344
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:49,237
..has worked every day of his life
to be able to stand next to him..

1345
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:54,970
..on the same studio floor, to
be able to take the fall for him.

1346
01:22:55,633 --> 01:22:56,900
To be able to say..

1347
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:01,503
''Look mom, you son has
become Sylvester. Look.''

1348
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,903
''He may be a duplicate,
but he has become Sylvester.''

1349
01:23:10,566 --> 01:23:13,902
ln India, whenever
something big like this happens..

1350
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:19,903
..we seek the blessings of our
elders, our parents or guru.

1351
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:25,638
Tonight l'd like to take the
blessings of the guru of action.

1352
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,434
Thank you very much.

1353
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,100
Thank you very much.

1354
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,901
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1355
01:23:45,633 --> 01:23:46,900
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1356
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,568
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1357
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,501
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1358
01:23:54,566 --> 01:23:57,302
''Supreme lord Vishnu
is the holiest one.''

1359
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,568
Must be their national anthem.
- Oh!

1360
01:23:59,633 --> 01:24:03,970
''Son of the Raghu
dynasty is the holiest one.''

1361
01:24:04,033 --> 01:24:08,103
''Supreme lord Vishnu
is the holiest one.''

1362
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:12,503
''Son of the Raghu
dynasty is the holiest one.''

1363
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:14,567
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1364
01:24:15,233 --> 01:24:16,567
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1365
01:24:17,566 --> 01:24:18,900
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1366
01:24:19,699 --> 01:24:21,168
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1367
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,568
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1368
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,500
Oh God.

1369
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,500
No!

1370
01:25:27,699 --> 01:25:28,901
Cut!

1371
01:25:29,966 --> 01:25:31,367
What the hell!

1372
01:25:33,233 --> 01:25:34,367
Let's do it again.

1373
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:38,436
l'm so sorry. - That's all right.
You scream pretty well.

1374
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:39,967
Thank you.

1375
01:25:40,033 --> 01:25:42,235
You're performing stunts
so soon after the surgery.

1376
01:25:42,633 --> 01:25:43,633
That's bad for you.

1377
01:25:44,366 --> 01:25:46,367
Come to me once for the check-up.

1378
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:48,301
Let me check if
everything is all right in there.

1379
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:52,369
ls this a circus? Is there a
circus going on here? - No.

1380
01:25:52,433 --> 01:25:53,634
Come on, bring me the protein shake.

1381
01:25:54,033 --> 01:25:55,367
Brother, l just gave it to you.

1382
01:25:55,433 --> 01:25:58,102
l know. l want the other one.
The soya-bean shake.

1383
01:25:58,166 --> 01:25:59,166
Go bring it.

1384
01:26:00,166 --> 01:26:02,434
Let me check it whether
this is good for you or not.

1385
01:26:04,966 --> 01:26:06,434
What happened? Why
can't you look happy?

1386
01:26:09,033 --> 01:26:10,100
Yes, it's fine.

1387
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:11,233
ls it good?
- Yes.

1388
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:15,037
Why wouldn't it be fine?
You've added so many things in it.

1389
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,501
l added?
- Yes. - What?

1390
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:20,233
You've added something.

1391
01:26:20,566 --> 01:26:27,239
Sweetness, kindness and goodness.

1392
01:26:27,966 --> 01:26:29,100
All right, l'll leave now.

1393
01:26:30,233 --> 01:26:33,903
What's the hurry?
When will we meet again?

1394
01:26:34,233 --> 01:26:35,233
ln half an hour.

1395
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,100
Such eagerness?

1396
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,167
Bye.

1397
01:26:41,233 --> 01:26:45,170
''l am a bad boy. l am good boy.''

1398
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:47,101
''l am a bad boy. l am good boy.''

1399
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:48,166
Do you have the money in the bank?

1400
01:26:49,633 --> 01:26:50,967
Nothing has happened yet.

1401
01:26:51,033 --> 01:26:52,434
lt will happen in half an hour.

1402
01:27:00,233 --> 01:27:01,367
Hey!
- You!

1403
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:03,967
What's wrong?

1404
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:05,968
You said the pills will
take affect in half an hour.

1405
01:27:06,033 --> 01:27:07,100
Yes. So?

1406
01:27:07,166 --> 01:27:09,968
And you said that every patient
of the studio is brought here.

1407
01:27:10,033 --> 01:27:11,100
Yes. So?

1408
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:12,233
Yes, but nothing happened.

1409
01:27:16,233 --> 01:27:17,300
Hello.

1410
01:27:17,366 --> 01:27:19,634
Hello, Sim. l'm so worried.

1411
01:27:19,699 --> 01:27:20,901
Why are you worried?

1412
01:27:21,233 --> 01:27:22,968
You know Lucky has not come home yet.

1413
01:27:23,033 --> 01:27:24,300
So, l called up the studio.

1414
01:27:24,633 --> 01:27:26,901
They said a stuntman has
been taken to the hospital.

1415
01:27:27,233 --> 01:27:28,500
l just hope it's not Lucky.

1416
01:27:28,566 --> 01:27:29,967
lt's Viraj, not Lucky.

1417
01:27:30,033 --> 01:27:31,100
How do you know?

1418
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:32,567
l hope it is Viraj.

1419
01:27:32,633 --> 01:27:34,434
St. Martin's is not too far away.

1420
01:27:34,966 --> 01:27:37,101
St. Martin's? What do
you mean St. Martin's?

1421
01:27:37,699 --> 01:27:38,967
That's the hospital name.

1422
01:27:39,033 --> 01:27:40,033
Why St. Martin's?

1423
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,634
What do you mean why?

1424
01:27:41,699 --> 01:27:42,901
l'll talk to you later.

1425
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,567
Sim! Sim, what's happening?

1426
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:45,900
Sim, tell me. Sim?

1427
01:27:59,166 --> 01:28:00,967
'Oh, God! He has got an X-ray?'

1428
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:05,166
'Oh God!'

1429
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:06,901
Brother, that..

1430
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:12,233
Viraj!

1431
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:15,503
Where is your watch, ma'am?
Where is it?

1432
01:28:16,366 --> 01:28:17,433
Where's your watch?

1433
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,903
Viraj, please try to understand.
My life is in your hands.

1434
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,367
Have you gone mad?

1435
01:28:26,566 --> 01:28:30,369
l'm sorry, Viraj. l
had forgotten the watch.

1436
01:28:31,233 --> 01:28:32,901
Forgot the watch? Where?

1437
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,901
Where did you forget it?

1438
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:37,567
You said you'd be
back in half an hour.

1439
01:28:37,633 --> 01:28:39,501
l've been waiting for four hours.

1440
01:28:39,566 --> 01:28:40,900
Where did you forget the watch?

1441
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,567
Did you forget it at home?

1442
01:28:43,966 --> 01:28:46,501
What?
- Yes. Did you leave it at home?

1443
01:28:50,966 --> 01:28:53,902
l had forgotten the watch at home.

1444
01:28:54,699 --> 01:28:56,902
l had forgotten the watch at home.

1445
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:59,567
l had forgotten the watch at home.
- Brother, she is mad.

1446
01:29:00,966 --> 01:29:04,903
Oh, Viraj!
- Brother! Brother! - Sorry.

1447
01:29:05,233 --> 01:29:10,905
l swear l'll never
drink your protein shake.

1448
01:29:11,166 --> 01:29:13,501
Brother, my stomach's hurting

1449
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,102
Take him away. Take him away.
Lock him up in the washroom.

1450
01:29:18,633 --> 01:29:19,967
What were you saying?

1451
01:29:21,966 --> 01:29:23,901
How can l talk here?

1452
01:29:25,233 --> 01:29:27,969
This is not the right place. l
want to meet you in private.

1453
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,434
Brother!
- Excuse me.

1454
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:30,500
What happened to him?

1455
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:32,901
''Bebo.''

1456
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,567
Brother..

1457
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:52,037
Listen, what do you do if
you want to control someone?

1458
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,235
What do you mean someone? Whom?

1459
01:29:57,166 --> 01:29:59,234
You know, guys.

1460
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:04,036
Guys! Well, usually l smile.

1461
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:07,102
Not you, l am talking
about a normal person.

1462
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:10,435
Why? What do you want
someone to do for you?

1463
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:15,170
Not me. l was just asking to
improve my general knowledge.

1464
01:30:17,033 --> 01:30:19,902
Usually, if you request politely,
then people will do it.

1465
01:30:20,699 --> 01:30:22,501
No, l can't do that.

1466
01:30:23,166 --> 01:30:24,166
You?

1467
01:30:24,433 --> 01:30:27,903
No. No. My friend was asking.

1468
01:30:28,633 --> 01:30:30,968
But you said you're asking to
improve your general knowledge?

1469
01:30:31,633 --> 01:30:35,103
Whatever the reason might be,
do you know the answer or not?

1470
01:30:35,366 --> 01:30:37,968
lf l knew it, l wouldn't
have filed for divorce.

1471
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:42,036
And if you want to know,
then why don't you ask Jackie?

1472
01:30:43,566 --> 01:30:46,969
With her short dresses
and her sweet talk..

1473
01:30:47,433 --> 01:30:49,368
..she brings everyone under control.

1474
01:31:23,033 --> 01:31:24,634
Right.
- Okay.

1475
01:31:25,633 --> 01:31:27,167
All right, call you later. Bye.

1476
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:32,367
Let's go for a swim.

1477
01:31:32,433 --> 01:31:33,433
Okay.

1478
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:37,367
So where are we off to now?

1479
01:31:38,366 --> 01:31:39,366
lnside.

1480
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:41,233
To swim?

1481
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,036
Yes.. You do have a bathtub,
don't you?

1482
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,034
You know where it led last time.

1483
01:31:46,633 --> 01:31:47,633
l know.

1484
01:31:48,366 --> 01:31:51,035
You do know that l want to
have golden babies with you.

1485
01:31:51,966 --> 01:31:56,970
With your skin, my eyes,
your hair and my smile.

1486
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:59,634
They will be so beautiful.

1487
01:31:59,699 --> 01:32:01,501
Yes, they will be striped babies.

1488
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:04,301
You never take me seriously.

1489
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:06,168
And if l do what you'll do.

1490
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:09,901
Try me.

1491
01:32:16,433 --> 01:32:17,901
''l am bad boy.''

1492
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:19,968
Her timing is always wrong.

1493
01:32:22,033 --> 01:32:23,100
What did you say?

1494
01:32:23,166 --> 01:32:26,302
Oh, my God! Denise Richards?

1495
01:32:27,366 --> 01:32:29,434
Nothing, l was just
thinking why don't you go inside..

1496
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,301
..and l'll get champagne.

1497
01:32:42,966 --> 01:32:44,300
You go in. l'll come.

1498
01:32:46,366 --> 01:32:48,167
So, you're going to
be shooting in Brazil?

1499
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,302
Busy?
- Yes, but.. Excuse me.

1500
01:32:54,566 --> 01:32:55,633
You?

1501
01:32:55,699 --> 01:32:58,903
Yes, me. And that was
Denise Richards, wasn't she?

1502
01:32:59,433 --> 01:33:01,902
Yes, that was Denise Richards.

1503
01:33:03,966 --> 01:33:05,967
l don't like Hollywood girls.

1504
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,368
They are so bland, you know.
You understand?

1505
01:33:08,699 --> 01:33:10,101
l like a girl l can take home.

1506
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:13,102
And tell mom, l want to
marry this Indian girl.

1507
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:15,034
lndian, you know.. - Which
Indian girl are you talking about?

1508
01:33:19,033 --> 01:33:22,302
Someone l want to meet
in private but she..

1509
01:33:23,366 --> 01:33:24,900
She too had come to meet you alone.

1510
01:33:25,966 --> 01:33:30,303
But Denise Richards got the
same idea then what could she do?

1511
01:33:30,566 --> 01:33:33,302
Does she want me to throw
Denise Richards outside?

1512
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:43,368
l'll see you tomorrow.

1513
01:33:47,566 --> 01:33:50,969
Hotel Venetian.
Room No.$01 at $:30pm.

1514
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,436
Now you can do your
stunts with Denise.

1515
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:00,233
Bye.

1516
01:34:00,566 --> 01:34:03,902
And tomorrow l'll do
the stunts with you.

1517
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:13,300
Four..

1518
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,301
Six.. eight..

01:34:17,433 --> 01:34:18,433
Ten..

1520
01:34:22,433 --> 01:34:26,103
Left glass. Left glass. Left glass!

1521
01:34:35,966 --> 01:34:37,901
''Ladies and gentlemen.''

1522
01:34:42,966 --> 01:34:44,300
''Bad boy's stop.''

1523
01:34:52,699 --> 01:34:53,967
''Bad boy's stop.''

1524
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:58,903
''Bad boy's stop.''

1525
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:02,634
You're looking hot.

1526
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,500
Thank you.

1527
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,301
Juice, coffee.

1528
01:35:09,966 --> 01:35:13,969
Tea or me?

1529
01:35:19,966 --> 01:35:21,233
Juice.

1530
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:23,901
''Bad boy's stop.''

1531
01:35:27,233 --> 01:35:28,500
Lucky glass!

1532
01:35:33,166 --> 01:35:34,634
Bottoms up!

1533
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,500
Bottoms up!

1534
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:14,567
ls there any reaction in you?

1535
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:20,968
Yes, there is.

1536
01:36:21,966 --> 01:36:22,966
Good.

1537
01:36:24,566 --> 01:36:27,302
lt's a very strong dose.

1538
01:36:29,566 --> 01:36:30,566
What are the symptoms?

1539
01:36:32,033 --> 01:36:33,367
My heart is beating faster.

1540
01:36:34,699 --> 01:36:36,034
l am breathing faster.

1541
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:42,905
Me too. Why? Why me?

1542
01:36:46,633 --> 01:36:50,169
You know, you're very sweet.

1543
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,901
But why were you so mean earlier?

1544
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,367
You too were so mean.

1545
01:37:00,233 --> 01:37:02,969
That's because you're so hot.

1546
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:08,303
And you used to think that
you could trap any girl.

1547
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,367
But l was wrong.

1548
01:37:11,366 --> 01:37:16,437
ln the past few days, l have
realised that you're not like that.

1549
01:37:19,966 --> 01:37:20,966
You're not, are you?

1550
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:25,300
No.

1551
01:37:28,966 --> 01:37:33,303
You know, my dad was like that.

1552
01:37:37,166 --> 01:37:38,967
My sister's husband is like that.

1553
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,234
But you are not like them.

1554
01:37:53,699 --> 01:37:54,901
You're not, are you?

1555
01:38:00,233 --> 01:38:01,233
No.

1556
01:38:01,633 --> 01:38:07,438
They think they can fool the
girls and take advantage of them.

1557
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:15,905
As if girls don't have a
heart filled with love.

1558
01:38:17,633 --> 01:38:18,900
But you are not like them.

1559
01:38:22,633 --> 01:38:23,633
You're not, are you?

1560
01:38:26,966 --> 01:38:27,966
Are you?

1561
01:38:30,633 --> 01:38:31,633
No.

1562
01:38:40,366 --> 01:38:41,366
What happened?

1563
01:38:41,966 --> 01:38:43,267
l'm talking too much, am l not?

1564
01:38:43,633 --> 01:38:45,101
No
- So kiss me.

1565
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,403
You'd said you knew
how to shut me up.

1566
01:39:22,366 --> 01:39:23,433
''Hey you.''

1567
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:26,368
''Every breath of
mine is close to you.''

1568
01:39:26,433 --> 01:39:29,435
''Why are you burning from inside?''

1569
01:39:30,133 --> 01:39:31,133
''Hey you.''

1570
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:34,068
''l'll be with you all night.''

1571
01:39:34,133 --> 01:39:37,236
''And talk to you about love.''

1572
01:39:37,633 --> 01:39:38,633
Bebo.

1573
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:42,470
''Bebo. l am Bebo.
Take away my heart.''

1574
01:39:42,966 --> 01:39:46,636
''l've come with my heart, take it.''

1575
01:39:46,699 --> 01:39:50,170
''Bebo. l am Bebo.
Take away my heart.''

1576
01:39:50,466 --> 01:39:54,436
''l've come with my heart, take it.''

1577
01:40:18,066 --> 01:40:22,036
''l am really, really nervous.''

1578
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:25,636
''Don't stop me.''

1579
01:40:25,966 --> 01:40:29,636
''My life is bound to you.''

1580
01:40:29,699 --> 01:40:33,336
''Don't go away from me.''

1581
01:40:33,399 --> 01:40:36,202
''To be away was just an excuse.''

1582
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:40,469
''l wanted to take it slow.''

1583
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,269
''l didn't really know.''

1584
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:49,637
''Our love is like a quarrel.''

1585
01:40:49,699 --> 01:40:53,003
''Bebo. l am Bebo.
Take away my heart.''

1586
01:40:53,366 --> 01:40:57,336
''l've come with my heart,
take it.''

1587
01:40:57,399 --> 01:41:00,636
''Bebo. l am Bebo.
Take away my heart.''

1588
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,970
''l've come with my heart,
take it.''

1589
01:41:05,033 --> 01:41:11,205
''Take it.''

1590
01:41:36,233 --> 01:41:39,970
''On the sly..''

1591
01:41:40,033 --> 01:41:43,569
''..why do you turn and look at me?''

1592
01:41:43,966 --> 01:41:51,039
''l am all yours.''

1593
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:54,636
''Every guy tried to woo me.''

1594
01:41:55,233 --> 01:41:59,170
''l was not impressed.''

1595
01:41:59,233 --> 01:42:01,969
''One glance from you..''

1596
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:06,504
''..has claimed my heart.''

1597
01:42:07,699 --> 01:42:11,270
''Bebo. l am Bebo.
Take away my heart.''

1598
01:42:11,333 --> 01:42:15,270
''l've come with my heart,
take it.''

1599
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:18,636
''Bebo. l am Bebo.
Take away my heart.''

1600
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,970
''l've come with my heart,
take it.''

1601
01:43:49,633 --> 01:43:52,435
''Fall in love.''

1602
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:25,403
''Fall in love.''

1603
01:44:34,466 --> 01:44:38,102
God is great! Hot baby doll.

1604
01:44:39,066 --> 01:44:42,002
lt seems you too
didn't sleep last night.

1605
01:44:42,699 --> 01:44:45,269
Earlier l had thought l'd sue you.

1606
01:44:45,333 --> 01:44:48,636
But now l think, why should l?

1607
01:44:49,066 --> 01:44:52,335
What if we come to a compromise?

1608
01:44:52,633 --> 01:44:55,635
lf we can get into a
compromising position..

1609
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,300
Get out!

1610
01:44:58,699 --> 01:45:01,569
Get out! Security!
- Sim?

1611
01:45:02,466 --> 01:45:05,969
What do you think of me?
All of you are the same.

1612
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,634
All men are the same.

1613
01:45:08,699 --> 01:45:09,967
Hey, come. Come with me.

1614
01:45:10,033 --> 01:45:12,268
They want only one thing
from girls. Scoundrels!

1615
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:22,569
Mr. Keswani, what is
your problem? What?

1616
01:45:22,633 --> 01:45:24,634
What is your problem?
What is my problem?

1617
01:45:24,699 --> 01:45:27,102
Now you're going to be
in big trouble.

1618
01:45:27,166 --> 01:45:30,636
Fool, first you left this
watch in my stomach. - Watch?

1619
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:33,102
The watch is ticking
while l'm talking.

1620
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:35,034
Wa.. Wa.. Watch?
- Watch! Watch!

1621
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:37,268
Watch? Oh, God!

1622
01:45:37,333 --> 01:45:39,435
Mr. Keswani, this is not your X-ray.

1623
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,635
Stupid! Idiot! Son of a gun!

1624
01:45:42,699 --> 01:45:45,002
Give me the good news.
Then whose is it if not mine?

1625
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:46,634
This is Viraj's X-ray.

1626
01:45:49,966 --> 01:45:53,436
Keswani, there's nothing
here for you.

1627
01:45:57,199 --> 01:46:00,202
You wanted to say something to me?

1628
01:46:00,566 --> 01:46:01,900
l want to give you something.

1629
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:08,535
Go wear this first.

1630
01:46:09,966 --> 01:46:10,966
Go.

1631
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,168
''Don't want to love.''

1632
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:23,635
''Don't need to love.''

1633
01:46:25,633 --> 01:46:26,633
Scoundrel!

1634
01:46:30,133 --> 01:46:31,300
''Wretched love.''

1635
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:33,901
''Wretched love.''

1636
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,269
''Wretched love.''

1637
01:46:40,133 --> 01:46:41,133
''Don't want to love.''

1638
01:46:42,466 --> 01:46:43,533
''Don't need to love.''

1639
01:46:44,966 --> 01:46:45,966
''Done want to love.''

1640
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:32,634
l don't believe this, Sim.

1641
01:48:35,566 --> 01:48:36,566
Kamini?

1642
01:48:37,133 --> 01:48:40,236
Lucky told me everything,
that you and Viraj..

1643
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:42,502
Don't take his name in the same
breath as mine for as long as l live.

1644
01:48:42,566 --> 01:48:44,434
But you love him, right?

1645
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,501
There's nothing between
Viraj and me.

1646
01:48:46,566 --> 01:48:48,067
lt was just an act.

1647
01:48:48,133 --> 01:48:49,968
You know how much l hate him.

1648
01:48:50,033 --> 01:48:54,103
When l was operating on Viraj,
l left my watch inside him.

1649
01:48:54,166 --> 01:48:56,301
What?
- l was really afraid.

1650
01:48:56,366 --> 01:48:57,467
lt was the question of my career.

1651
01:48:57,533 --> 01:48:58,901
l thought l was
going to lose everything.

1652
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:05,537
When nothing else was working l
pretended to be in love with him.

1653
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,634
l was so worried.

1654
01:49:06,966 --> 01:49:08,634
l'm not that foolish, Kamini..

1655
01:49:09,133 --> 01:49:11,101
..that l'd fall in
Iove with a guy like him.

1656
01:49:19,266 --> 01:49:20,300
What are you doing here?

1657
01:49:21,466 --> 01:49:23,568
What were you telling Kamini?

1658
01:49:23,633 --> 01:49:24,633
The truth!

1659
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,167
lt's such a relief.

1660
01:49:26,233 --> 01:49:31,504
l was fed up of
pretending to love someone l hate.

1661
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:33,633
Sim..

1662
01:49:33,699 --> 01:49:35,101
Dr. Simrita Rai.

1663
01:49:35,166 --> 01:49:38,002
Now l won't have to
hear you call out my name.

1664
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:39,967
lt feels like an abuse.

1665
01:49:40,966 --> 01:49:41,966
Now just get out!

1666
01:49:42,699 --> 01:49:45,969
Hey.. Hey, you're just joking,
right?

1667
01:49:46,699 --> 01:49:48,001
You're just joking, right?

1668
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:53,638
Kamini, what did l tell you
about the IQ of a stuntman?

1669
01:49:53,966 --> 01:49:55,400
They're just so freaking dumb.

1670
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:57,100
Freaking idiots.

1671
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:06,635
Why did you do this to me?

1672
01:50:07,133 --> 01:50:09,969
l did what l what was right.

1673
01:50:10,466 --> 01:50:12,634
l treated you like you
deserve to be treated.

1674
01:50:17,566 --> 01:50:21,002
But l deserve you. l love you.

1675
01:50:23,433 --> 01:50:25,101
We were going to get married.

1676
01:50:25,466 --> 01:50:29,636
Marriage? Who's going to
marry a sick scoundrel like you?

1677
01:50:30,699 --> 01:50:33,202
God! Just get out.

1678
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:35,334
Get out!

1679
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,268
God, he just doesn't get it

1680
01:51:23,966 --> 01:51:24,966
Cut!

1681
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:28,569
Yes.. cut it..
- Okay.

1682
01:51:28,633 --> 01:51:30,968
Great shot Viraj. Moving on.

1683
01:51:31,033 --> 01:51:34,336
That was a great shot. He loved it.
- Thank you.

1684
01:51:37,699 --> 01:51:39,001
That was a great shot, brother.

1685
01:51:43,466 --> 01:51:45,501
Viraj.
- Hi. - Hi.

1686
01:51:46,633 --> 01:51:47,633
What's wrong?

1687
01:51:48,433 --> 01:51:49,500
Nothing.

1688
01:51:49,566 --> 01:51:50,633
Nothing?

1689
01:51:50,699 --> 01:51:53,102
Well, is there
anything l can do to help you?

1690
01:51:54,966 --> 01:51:55,966
Marry me.

1691
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:58,100
Marry me.

1692
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:01,569
You always jokingly say
that you want golden babies.

1693
01:52:01,633 --> 01:52:02,633
Yes.

1694
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:04,634
So what if l say yes. Then?

1695
01:52:05,166 --> 01:52:07,101
Then l'd say yes.

1696
01:52:07,699 --> 01:52:09,535
Hey Denise, the shot is ready.

1697
01:52:12,699 --> 01:52:15,436
Say when and we'll go get a ring.

1698
01:52:20,966 --> 01:52:22,100
Hi.
- Hey.

1699
01:52:22,166 --> 01:52:23,500
How are you?
- Great. - Good.

1700
01:52:32,033 --> 01:52:33,033
What are you doing, brother?

1701
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,468
l want to see..

1702
01:52:36,533 --> 01:52:38,001
..whether a sick scoundrel
like me gets married or not.

1703
01:52:48,199 --> 01:52:51,169
Why are you trying
to remove this ring?

1704
01:52:51,233 --> 01:52:52,334
What's wrong with it?

1705
01:52:53,966 --> 01:52:54,966
Viraj gave it to me.

1706
01:52:55,466 --> 01:52:58,001
Sim, Viraj proposed?

1707
01:52:58,433 --> 01:53:00,268
This is great.

1708
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:02,535
God has finally heard my prayers.

1709
01:53:02,966 --> 01:53:04,634
Come on, decide on a date.

1710
01:53:04,699 --> 01:53:06,301
l've also got a proposal.

1711
01:53:06,366 --> 01:53:08,634
l will also say yes.

1712
01:53:08,699 --> 01:53:10,501
We'll get matching wedding outfits.

1713
01:53:10,966 --> 01:53:12,567
And take our vows together.

1714
01:53:12,633 --> 01:53:13,633
Stop it!

1715
01:53:14,699 --> 01:53:16,101
lt was a bogus engagement.

1716
01:53:16,166 --> 01:53:17,901
And for all you know, this
ring might also be fake.

1717
01:53:19,466 --> 01:53:20,466
Fake?

1718
01:53:21,333 --> 01:53:22,333
Of course.

1719
01:53:22,966 --> 01:53:24,033
How can l ever think..

1720
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:27,002
..of getting engaged,
married or be in a relationship.

1721
01:53:27,466 --> 01:53:30,435
After what happened
to Nim and with mom?

1722
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:32,968
What happened to your mom?

1723
01:53:33,699 --> 01:53:36,202
You were just a year
old when they separated.

1724
01:53:36,633 --> 01:53:37,633
How would you know?

1725
01:53:37,966 --> 01:53:39,967
Did your mom ever tell you anything?

1726
01:53:40,366 --> 01:53:41,366
No.

1727
01:53:41,633 --> 01:53:42,633
What could she say?

1728
01:53:43,033 --> 01:53:44,968
Could she say that she got
into an arranged marriage..

1729
01:53:45,033 --> 01:53:46,968
..because her parents forced her to..

1730
01:53:47,033 --> 01:53:49,635
..but she couldn't love her husband?

1731
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:51,167
Or could she have said that..

1732
01:53:51,233 --> 01:53:55,270
..her husband tried
to save the marriage..

1733
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:57,435
..but she was very stubborn?

1734
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,635
Just like you. She
didn't give in to him.

1735
01:54:00,133 --> 01:54:02,635
Finally, your father gave
up and went back to India.

1736
01:54:02,966 --> 01:54:05,435
And by the time your
mother realised her mistake..

1737
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,234
..it was too late.

1738
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:11,569
Your mom told me all this, not you.

1739
01:54:11,633 --> 01:54:13,968
She told me to see to
it that her daughters..

1740
01:54:14,033 --> 01:54:15,968
..don't repeat her mistakes.

1741
01:54:16,333 --> 01:54:19,636
Do you think l enjoy
nagging you to get married?

1742
01:54:20,033 --> 01:54:23,269
Don't l know that you
think l'm just a joke?

1743
01:54:23,333 --> 01:54:25,334
And that you're putting up
with me just because of your mom?

1744
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:28,201
l pity you.

1745
01:54:28,266 --> 01:54:33,204
l'm putting up with the burden
which your mom passed on to me.

1746
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:04,401
lf you had told him the truth..

1747
01:55:05,033 --> 01:55:06,501
..brother would have himself
come in for the operation.

1748
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:09,001
Listen, you know nothing about me.

1749
01:55:09,066 --> 01:55:11,435
l know everything you
did the other night.

1750
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:14,202
Just shut up! - Why? Sounds terrible
to hear the truth, doesn't it?

1751
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:18,503
l feel worse thinking you were
ready to do anything that night.

1752
01:55:18,566 --> 01:55:21,335
But for the first time,
my brother controlled himself.

1753
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,635
He.. he didn't..

1754
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,435
No Simrita. He did not
sleep with you.

1755
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:30,567
l think he should have.

1756
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
But he didn't do it.

1757
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:40,106
Maybe because he loves you
as much as l love Kamini.

1758
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,969
Just because of your ego,
you've broken two relationships.

1759
01:55:44,533 --> 01:55:46,401
Yours and Kamini's.

1760
01:55:47,366 --> 01:55:48,967
lt's our divorce hearing tomorrow.

1761
01:55:50,166 --> 01:55:51,166
Good luck.

1762
01:56:04,533 --> 01:56:15,010
''Why have the
flowers lost their colour?''

1763
01:56:16,199 --> 01:56:26,910
''Why have the
flowers lost their colour?''

1764
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:37,442
''Why am l so cross
with myself these days?''

1765
01:57:03,433 --> 01:57:06,269
''Maybe in one of our meetings.''

1766
01:57:06,333 --> 01:57:09,269
''l said something wrong.''

1767
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:12,002
''False promises were made.''

1768
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:14,902
''Because of some excuse.''

1769
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:20,071
''l found you, and then l lost you.''

1770
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:23,502
''lt was my mistake.''

1771
01:57:23,566 --> 01:57:26,201
''This is my punishment.''

1772
01:57:26,266 --> 01:57:32,538
''And yet my heart asks
why did this happen.''

1773
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:41,909
''Why am l so cross
with myself these days?''

1774
01:58:07,966 --> 01:58:10,435
''My story is so blurry.''

1775
01:58:10,699 --> 01:58:13,636
''That's why there
are tears in my eyes.''

1776
01:58:13,699 --> 01:58:16,536
''As they roll down my cheeks.''

1777
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:19,269
''They leave a symbol of my sorrow.''

1778
01:58:19,633 --> 01:58:24,204
''All my wishes have been shattered.''

1779
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,569
''lt's my mistake.''

1780
01:58:27,966 --> 01:58:30,535
''This is my punishment.''

1781
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:36,973
''And yet my heart asks
why did this happen.''

1782
01:58:37,033 --> 01:58:46,208
''Why am l so cross
with myself these days?''

1783
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:10,510
''Why have the
flowers lost their colour?''

1784
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:36,500
You may now sign

1785
01:59:43,033 --> 01:59:44,033
Stop!

1786
01:59:49,633 --> 01:59:53,303
Are you guys out of your
minds to renounce such happiness?

1787
01:59:55,566 --> 01:59:58,101
And for a stuck up
little witch like me?

1788
02:00:00,366 --> 02:00:02,367
Kamini, you listened to your heart,
and fell in love with him.

1789
02:00:03,699 --> 02:00:04,967
Then why are you
listening to your mind..

1790
02:00:05,033 --> 02:00:07,368
..when it is time to
stick to your love?

1791
02:00:08,633 --> 02:00:11,902
Don't you have a mind?
Can't you even think?

1792
02:00:13,566 --> 02:00:15,901
Can't you see how much he loves you?

1793
02:00:20,366 --> 02:00:21,366
l'm sorry, Kamini.

1794
02:00:27,033 --> 02:00:28,033
Sorry, Lucky.

1795
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:29,634
lt's okay.

1796
02:00:29,699 --> 02:00:31,902
You would have lost
your love because of me.

1797
02:00:32,366 --> 02:00:35,302
And you'll lose your
Iove if you don't hurry up.

1798
02:00:35,699 --> 02:00:37,101
l've already lost it.

1799
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:42,103
He has found true love.
And he's marrying her.

1800
02:00:44,366 --> 02:00:46,034
l just want to see him happy.

1801
02:00:46,100 --> 02:00:47,100
Crap!

1802
02:00:47,433 --> 02:00:50,169
Don't you always say
that all stuntmen are dumb?

1803
02:00:50,233 --> 02:00:52,969
l'm sorry that..
- It's true. Absolutely true.

1804
02:00:53,033 --> 02:00:55,635
My brother is just being an idiot.
He doesn't love her.

1805
02:00:55,966 --> 02:00:59,235
Nor does she love him.
She's just satisfying a whim.

1806
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:00,968
And Viraj?
- Brother is trying to prove..

1807
02:01:01,033 --> 02:01:03,502
..something to himself. That's all.

1808
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:12,436
How stupid! These stuntmen.

1809
02:01:23,566 --> 02:01:25,100
Lucky, look ahead.

1810
02:02:06,366 --> 02:02:08,968
All right guys. l don't want
any trouble so just back off..

1811
02:02:09,033 --> 02:02:10,634
..We need to get somewhere.
All right?

1812
02:02:10,966 --> 02:02:12,500
You should have thought
about that..

1813
02:02:12,566 --> 02:02:13,633
..before you came
into this neighbourhood.

1814
02:02:13,699 --> 02:02:16,436
l know, but l need to get somewhere.
So, just back off. All right?

1815
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:19,636
Tell you what.. you go
and let the chicks stay.

1816
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:20,901
Hello baby!

1817
02:02:25,433 --> 02:02:26,634
Run! Run!

1818
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:31,400
Get the girl!

1819
02:02:40,166 --> 02:02:41,166
Help!

1820
02:03:16,233 --> 02:03:17,233
What's up, guys?

1821
02:03:18,166 --> 02:03:19,467
All's good in the hood?

1822
02:03:19,533 --> 02:03:20,967
You're in the wrong neighbourhood.

1823
02:03:29,699 --> 02:03:31,501
What's up baby?
You want some of this?

1824
02:03:31,966 --> 02:03:32,966
l know you like it.

1825
02:04:01,966 --> 02:04:02,966
Come on.

1826
02:04:03,566 --> 02:04:04,566
Come on.

1827
02:04:05,233 --> 02:04:06,968
You. You. You. Come on.

1828
02:04:19,033 --> 02:04:20,100
Thank you.

1829
02:04:20,166 --> 02:04:22,635
Lucky, get up.
- Kamini.

1830
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:25,168
Lucky, are you okay?
- Yes, l'm okay.

1831
02:04:25,699 --> 02:04:26,901
Are you okay?
- Yes.

1832
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:29,168
Where is Simrita?
- Simrita?

1833
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:34,367
Sir.
- Hey, Lucky.

1834
02:04:35,166 --> 02:04:36,433
Sir, thank you so much
for your help.

1835
02:04:37,033 --> 02:04:38,234
l'll see you on the set tomorrow.

1836
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:39,300
You got that, sir.

1837
02:04:39,566 --> 02:04:40,566
Shall we?

1838
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:43,100
Shall we?

1839
02:04:44,233 --> 02:04:45,300
Shall we?

1840
02:04:45,366 --> 02:04:46,366
Go!

1841
02:04:47,033 --> 02:04:48,033
Let's go.

1842
02:04:48,366 --> 02:04:49,366
Come on. Let's go.

1843
02:04:52,033 --> 02:04:53,033
Thank you, sir.

1844
02:05:05,233 --> 02:05:07,301
Kambakkht Ishq. (Damned Love)

1845
02:05:34,566 --> 02:05:40,371
We gather here today to join
Viraj and Denise in holy matrimony.

1846
02:05:41,233 --> 02:05:47,505
You may now exchange the rings.
- Yes.

1847
02:05:57,233 --> 02:05:58,634
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1848
02:05:59,566 --> 02:06:00,900
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1849
02:06:01,633 --> 02:06:03,501
''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

1850
02:06:03,966 --> 02:06:10,639
''Supreme lord Vishnu
is the holiest one.''

1851
02:06:10,966 --> 02:06:15,236
''Son of the Raghu dynasty is the
holiest one.'' - Sister-in-law?

1852
02:06:19,033 --> 02:06:20,033
How dare you?

1853
02:06:27,633 --> 02:06:28,633
l mean how could you?

1854
02:06:31,699 --> 02:06:33,435
l know l have no right..

1855
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:36,367
..because of what l've done to you.

1856
02:06:38,699 --> 02:06:39,901
And l know it's too late.

1857
02:06:42,233 --> 02:06:44,635
But all l want to
say is that l love you.

1858
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,100
l'm sorry.

1859
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:56,169
But don't marry
for the wrong reason.

1860
02:06:58,433 --> 02:07:02,637
She's a good girl.
She's really very nice.

1861
02:07:04,566 --> 02:07:05,633
Don't do this to her.
It won't be fair.

1862
02:07:06,033 --> 02:07:07,367
Yes, l know.

1863
02:07:11,033 --> 02:07:13,502
But l deserve..
- You deserve me, Viraj.

1864
02:07:25,566 --> 02:07:26,566
Excuse me.

1865
02:08:00,899 --> 02:08:02,501
So what were you saying?
- Brother please..

1866
02:08:02,566 --> 02:08:03,566
Hold on!

1867
02:08:05,633 --> 02:08:07,434
You were saying
something about a guy like me.

1868
02:08:07,899 --> 02:08:08,900
Come with me.

1869
02:08:09,633 --> 02:08:12,969
Yes, l was destined to fall
in love with a guy like you.

1870
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:15,568
l'm lucky that l found you.

1871
02:08:18,566 --> 02:08:22,036
You changed me by
coming into my life.

1872
02:08:23,633 --> 02:08:26,569
You left, and it changed again

1873
02:08:27,233 --> 02:08:29,034
l changed so much that
l couldn't recognise myself.

1874
02:08:29,966 --> 02:08:31,567
Please Viraj, don't
throw me out of here.

1875
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:34,568
l know it was wrong
of me to come here.

1876
02:08:34,633 --> 02:08:36,301
Please try to understand.

1877
02:08:38,633 --> 02:08:40,901
l was used to living my
life on my own terms..

1878
02:08:40,966 --> 02:08:42,100
.. and taking my own decisions.

1879
02:08:43,166 --> 02:08:44,233
Right or wrong.

1880
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:45,834
l made mistakes and
l corrected them.

1881
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:47,901
l had no one to take care of me..

1882
02:08:47,966 --> 02:08:50,301
..and save me from
myself until you came along.

1883
02:08:51,166 --> 02:08:52,166
Get in the car.

1884
02:08:52,966 --> 02:08:56,035
Get in the car!

1885
02:08:57,366 --> 02:08:58,567
Are you foolish?

1886
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:01,568
lf you don't get in the car,
how will we elope?

1887
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:04,300
Do you understand?

1888
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:15,301
Love you. l love you.

1889
02:09:23,166 --> 02:09:24,166
Yes!

1890
02:09:24,566 --> 02:09:25,566
Yes!

1891
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:31,500
Thank you.

1892
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:42,567
''Mangalam.''

1893
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:44,834
''Mangalam.''

1894
02:09:45,633 --> 02:09:49,169
''Mangalam.''

1895
02:09:52,033 --> 02:09:55,870
Bye. Bye!
- ''Mangalam.''

1896
02:09:56,500 --> 02:10:00,570
''Mangalam. Don't want to love.''

1897
02:10:00,633 --> 02:10:02,568
''Mangalam.
- Don't need to love.''

1898
02:10:02,966 --> 02:10:04,967
''Don't want to love.''

1899
02:10:05,033 --> 02:10:06,033
So, you love me?

1900
02:10:06,633 --> 02:10:08,034
What a stupid question to ask.

1901
02:10:08,966 --> 02:10:10,567
l'm not stupid, you are.

1902
02:10:11,166 --> 02:10:15,236
What would l have done had
you married Denise Richards?

1903
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:19,236
How dumb! No IQ, l tell you.

1904
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:21,568
Did l get married to
Denise Richards?

1905
02:10:22,899 --> 02:10:24,034
l'm not dumb, you are.

1906
02:10:24,300 --> 02:10:26,101
You didn't even know
that you loved me.

1907
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:27,567
And you..

1908
02:10:29,233 --> 02:10:32,169
Just a minute. Just..

1909
02:10:34,899 --> 02:10:35,900
Okay.

1910
02:10:37,366 --> 02:10:38,433
You talk too much.

1911
02:10:39,566 --> 02:10:42,035
