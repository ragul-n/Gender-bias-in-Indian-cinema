1
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,292
Shankar?

2
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,333
You are being released tomorrow, right?

3
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,583
Are you having trouble falling asleep?

4
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,333
I've been here for so many years...

5
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:33,917
Yes.

6
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,083
Not years...

7
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,167
You've been here for three decades.

8
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,708
You were wrongly accused in those cases.

9
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,708
I don't care about that.

10
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:47,250
I care about the struggle...

11
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,042
and the countless lives that were lost...

12
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,750
in the name of revolution.

13
00:02:57,042 --> 00:03:01,083
You've become old... and weak.

14
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,167
Where will you go?

15
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:09,083
I'll go see Raju.

16
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:11,542
Yes.

17
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,917
Back then, we met
when the situation was adverse.

18
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,292
But our paths diverged.

19
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,042
I don't know where he is now.

20
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:22,750
Who's Raju?

21
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,875
A Naxalite?

22
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,792
No.

23
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:34,000
A lover.

24
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,958
JAYAGIRI VILLAGE

25
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,000
Son.

26
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,083
A man named Raju
used to live in this village.

27
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,458
-His house--
-Raju? He's my friend.

28
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,625
I guess he must be of your age.

29
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:39,375
-Anyone else by that name?
-Tell me his phone number. I'll check.

30
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:43,333
I don't know if Raju has a phone.

31
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,417
You neither know his address
nor his phone number.

32
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:46,750
We can't help you.

33
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,375
Raju? What does he do?

34
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,875
His father used to paint houses.

35
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,417
A painter?
Do we have any painters around here?

36
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,375
Not that I know of.

37
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,750
By the way, who are you?

38
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:12,000
<i>My dear, my poetry is inspired by you.</i>

39
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,375
<i>You are the waves of the ocean</i>
<i>in my heart.</i>

40
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,708
<i>You are the rainbow</i>
<i>that stretches across the sky.</i>

41
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,000
<i>You are the moonshine</i>
<i>that melts the skies.</i>

42
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:25,917
<i>You are the ecstasy I want forever.</i>

43
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:31,667
<i>My dear, you are the pearl that dwells</i>
<i>in the oyster of my heart.</i>

44
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,333
I know Raju.

45
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,208
I know the Raju you are looking for.

46
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,500
But who are you?

47
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,917
I...

48
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,250
I am his friend.

49
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,917
His friend?

50
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,958
How did you become friends?

51
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:08,083
I met Raju... in the police station.

52
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,667
-He told me about him.
-What did he tell you?

53
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,958
About his love... for the princess.

54
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,125
Shank...

55
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,792
Shankar?

56
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,333
-Who are you?
-I used to work for His Majesty.

57
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,125
I am Siddha.

58
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,708
Where is he now?

59
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,417
Did he marry the princess?

60
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,083
I came here as soon as I got out of jail.

61
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,875
Where is Raju now?

62
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,042
God, we're so late!

63
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,542
Your train never arrives on time.

64
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,500
Yeah, right!
Raju, go slow, okay?

65
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,000
I've rented this bicycle from Kareem.

66
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,750
Don't tell him that
the three of us rode on it.

67
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,583
He'll charge us extra.

68
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,708
That's right.

69
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,917
-Damn it!
-Oh, God!

70
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,917
Hey, Buchi! Are you blind?

71
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,667
Buchi?

72
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,000
-Go.
-Kareem is right there.

73
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,917
Go on, keep it there.

74
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,417
-Shit!
-Run!

75
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,500
What did you do this time?

76
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,917
A FRIENDSHIP THAT WILL LAST FOREVER

77
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,208
It's been ages since we came here!

78
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,417
As kids, we used to play here every day!

79
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,792
But ever since you've moved,
we haven't climbed this fort.

80
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,083
Yes, and he never skips school
to see us.

81
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,667
The last time we saw him
was during his summer break.

82
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,208
You don't know this, right?

83
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,833
Do you remember the mailman's
daughter Vasantha?

84
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:44,667
-Yes.
-Seenu is dating her.

85
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:48,208
Vasantha was in school with us, right?

86
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,292
Yeah.

87
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,875
-Is he really dating her?
-Yes.

88
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,917
Look at him, he's blushing!

89
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,500
That's His Majesty's car.

90
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,208
I have to make arrangements
for the festival.

91
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,292
I completely forgot about it.

92
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,875
You're studying too hard.

93
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:23,667
It's been years since you moved.

94
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,958
You look so thin.

95
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,875
Is Grandma taking good care of you?

96
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,458
Of course, not!
He looks miserable.

97
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,958
Nothing like that, Dad.
She takes good care of me.

98
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:38,542
You're here after so long.
And you're leaving just in four days?

99
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,833
Will you be able to stay for a month?

100
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,083
We aren't allowed to take
so many leaves, Mom.

101
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,917
I can stay for fifteen days.

102
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,542
My exams are just around the corner.

103
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:51,167
That's what you say every time.

104
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,583
Listen, there's a lady selling fish.

105
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:56,417
You think you have the money to buy fish?

106
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,875
I've borrowed two eggs and boiled them.

107
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,667
Come on, son. Let's eat.

108
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,958
Mom, I'm tired.
When will she come out?

109
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,875
Just a few more minutes.
She'll be here.

110
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,792
The princess has grown up, right?

111
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,750
I saw her two years ago.

112
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,833
-She looked like a kid then.
-Yes.

113
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,667
Even I had seen her a long time ago.

114
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,958
-She's still a little girl.
-Shut up.

115
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,333
Do not address her by the word "girl."

116
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:57,083
What if His Majesty finds out?

117
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,375
You're talking about them
as if they are your family.

118
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:05,083
I know them because Dad and I
visit them quite often.

119
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:11,042
Do you think the princess eats
cheap food like we do?

120
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,583
She eats rice with chicken curry
and yogurt.

121
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,625
They change recipes for every meal.

122
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,083
That's why she was glowing.

123
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,167
No, that's not the case.

124
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,125
Don't tell this to anybody.

125
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:28,417
The princess hit puberty three years ago.

126
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,542
What do you mean by "hitting puberty"?

127
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,083
That means...
Well, I don't know.

128
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,000
But it's supposed to be
something special for girls.

129
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,500
And that's the case
with the princess as well.

130
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,292
Listen. You were
recently circumcised, weren't you?

131
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,417
Is that what hitting puberty means?

132
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,667
Not at all!
It's completely different!

133
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:54,083
Really?
Then what does it mean?

134
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,708
You'll know when it happens to you.

135
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,125
You guys never tell me anything!

136
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,083
How am I supposed to just know it?

137
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:14,625
Please tell me.
What does hitting puberty mean?

138
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,667
It means hitting puberty in the face.

139
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,000
What does that mean?

140
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:26,792
God shall grant you
everything you want, Your Highness.

141
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,833
All the riches, diamonds and pearls.

142
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,792
Please give me something
in the name of God.

143
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,542
I'll bless you with all my heart.

144
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,667
Seenu.

145
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,333
I am here for Seenu.

146
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,042
Hey!

147
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,042
Why did you come here?

148
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,000
Come with me.
You shouldn't step into the fort.

149
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,667
You had asked me
to write something, right?

150
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,167
Here. Give this to Vasantha.

151
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,167
You have no idea how
impactful Raju's poems are.

152
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,083
"My dear...

153
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,208
I am the dream..."

154
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,208
Why did you do that?

155
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:44,000
Look over there.
That's Siddha.

156
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,833
He works for His Majesty,
just like my dad.

157
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:48,167
If he finds out...
No!

158
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,458
One cannot afford to fall in love
in this village.

159
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,500
-Let's just go.
-But why?

160
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,417
Don't worry.
I'll write another poem.

161
00:17:58,875 --> 00:17:59,875
Go give it to Vasantha.

162
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,292
I'll lace it into a single braid, Padma.

163
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,792
I've got a lot of work.

164
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,500
-God, please. I'll look like an old woman.
-That's Vasantha.

165
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,375
Which one of the two?

166
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,083
The younger one.

167
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,875
The one who's lacing the braid.

168
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,917
Her father is here. What do we do?

169
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,458
-You see that telephone?
-Yes.

170
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,875
We'll pretend making a call.

171
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,792
Then you can go give her this letter.

172
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,625
Really? Do you even know
how to make a call?

173
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,333
And whom will you call?

174
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,542
I have the number to the fort.
Let's call them up.

175
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,375
No way!

176
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,458
-Please don't.
-Okay, we won't.

177
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,667
We'll put on an act.

178
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,375
Let's go. And don't be scared.

179
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,333
Hey, don't go looking like that.

180
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:52,083
No, I don't need it.

181
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,167
-Stand still.
-Much better.

182
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,333
Why are you unlacing the braid?

183
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,042
Seenu.

184
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,417
-Keep an eye on him.
-Yeah!

185
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,250
Hey, why is he pacing like that?

186
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,375
Maybe his radio is not
catching any frequency.

187
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,292
My dear...

188
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,458
I am the dream

189
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,375
And you are its form

190
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,167
Why is he reciting
the poem he wrote for me?

191
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,000
I am the cloud

192
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,042
And you are the rain

193
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,750
I am the poem

194
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,000
And you are the melody

195
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,958
I am the night

196
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,125
And you...
You are the moon

197
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,833
<i>My dear...</i>

198
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,042
<i>I am the dream</i>

199
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:28,083
<i>And you are its form</i>

200
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,542
<i>I am the cloud</i>

201
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,375
<i>And you are the rain</i>

202
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,125
<i>I am the poem</i>

203
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,667
<i>And you are the melody</i>

204
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:58,583
He wants money for his studies.
But we can't arrange for it.

205
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,958
We're broke.

206
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,958
And no one will loan us money.

207
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,083
We've got to do something.

208
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,333
We'll have to ask His Majesty.

209
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,167
Hey, Iloni!
His Majesty wants to see you!

210
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,250
Everyone comes to the office
to get the paperwork done.

211
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:37,375
And then there's His Majesty!
He brought the office to his fort.

212
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,208
But...

213
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:48,375
the princess will have to go sign
the documents for the registration...

214
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,458
in Darmasagar tomorrow.

215
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,708
How can the princess
go without His Majesty?

216
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,125
He's very busy.

217
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:59,625
Darmasagar is a different territory.
Otherwise, I'd have taken care of it.

218
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,125
-Really?
-Yes.

219
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,625
Sir, His Majesty wanted to see us?

220
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:07,875
When we threatened
to confiscate your harvest,

221
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,125
you said you'd pay your debts.

222
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,417
It's almost harvest time.
When will you pay up?

223
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,375
Don't think you can escape it.

224
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,375
Don't say such things, sir.

225
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:17,917
Please try to understand.

226
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,917
Fate has not been on our side.

227
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,333
Give us some more time
and we'll pay you back.

228
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,625
You're so arrogant!

229
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,667
Don't you dare talk to me like that.

230
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,250
His Majesty is furious.

231
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,917
He doesn't want you to
work on the fields anymore.

232
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,708
Go away! Get lost!

233
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:35,167
Sir... please don't say that.

234
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,167
We won't be able to survive
without the land.

235
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:42,208
That land is our only source of income.

236
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,500
We'll do anything you ask us to, sir.

237
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,000
Never try to argue with me again!

238
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,583
You filthy lowlife!

239
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,167
Try and learn something from your wife.

240
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,833
Pay the debt as soon as you can!

241
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,333
-Okay, sir.
-Okay, sir.

242
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,292
You should get an education.

243
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:07,750
In fact, everyone in this village
should get an education.

244
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,583
But we did, didn't we?

245
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:14,042
We were in school till the fifth grade,
weren't we?

246
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:16,542
Yeah, and we passed it as well.

247
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,583
So did his Vasantha.

248
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:23,125
It was so many years ago.
Why are you talking about it again?

249
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,042
Education can be pursued at any age.

250
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,750
It will make your life better.

251
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,833
Your parents can afford it
because you are their only son.

252
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:33,292
But our parents cannot.

253
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,583
Who will work in the fields
and take care of the cattle?

254
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,375
Who will work in the fort?

255
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:40,583
We want to get an education.
But we don't have a choice.

256
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,000
We need to work so that we can survive.

257
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,833
In fact, I was at
His Majesty's place last night,

258
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,417
repairing the motor.

259
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:49,000
You think we'll get better jobs
if we study?

260
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,042
You're a talented poet

261
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,333
and your father has the guts
to give you an education as well.

262
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,875
My father also wanted me to study.

263
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:59,500
But we are burdened with debts.

264
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:02,042
I know what you
and your family is going through.

265
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,292
I am not asking you to quit your job.

266
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:07,458
You can study and work at the same time.

267
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:09,875
But don't do it just to get better jobs.

268
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,958
Education is for enlightenment.

269
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,625
Start by reading newspapers and books.

270
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,500
Education will make you independent.

271
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:19,583
You won't have to bow before anybody.

272
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:22,208
You're right, but...

273
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:26,083
Where will we get the books?
Tell me.

274
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,750
You can go to the library.

275
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:30,833
But you won't, right?

276
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,917
DHARMAVARAM LIBRARY

277
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,958
DISTRICT OFFICE

278
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,083
You don't need to get into the details.

279
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,125
I'll take care of everything.

280
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:00,542
Make sure...

281
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,667
Everything seems okay.

282
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:13,208
This land will be registered
under your name.

283
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,083
Please sign here.

284
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,125
Where's that file I asked you to bring?

285
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,667
We can't sell our land.

286
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,583
How will we survive?

287
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:28,625
Why are you selling the land
if you're feeling so bad about it?

288
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:35,833
Are you selling the land out of fear?

289
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:53,167
I need to talk to my father.

290
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:56,542
Can we do the registration after that?

291
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,750
Oh, God! How did you fall, you fool?

292
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,583
Hey, where were you looking?

293
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,833
You could have damaged the car.
Get lost!

294
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,208
The princess is so pretty.

295
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:37,292
May God bless her mother's soul.

296
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:39,708
She looks exactly like her.

297
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,292
Hey, what are you doing here?

298
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:32,333
The sub-divisional officer
was killed in a bomb blast.

299
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,958
Now they're attacking the police as well.
Let's go.

300
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:38,917
Seenu, it's getting dark.

301
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,458
Go bring some diesel for
His Majesty's car.

302
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,167
But why?

303
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,375
The village is burning.

304
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,208
He won't let the princess stay here.

305
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,917
He's sending her to the city tomorrow.

306
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:03,875
What is it?

307
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,542
Why did you wake me up at this hour?

308
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,250
Your father said that the princess
is going to Hyderabad, right?

309
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:14,500
Yes. So what?

310
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:21,750
I...

311
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,625
I am in love with her.

312
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,042
And I think she loves me too.

313
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,792
She also gave me an umbrella.

314
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:31,292
You...

315
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,000
YOU TOUCHED MY HEART
I COME TO YOU, LEAVING EVERYTHING BEHIND.

316
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,958
Hari, let's turn around.

317
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:53,208
What happened?

318
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:56,417
I'll tell you once we're back in the fort.

319
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,250
Ameen is here, Your Majesty.

320
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,167
Hello, Your Majesty.

321
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,875
Yesterday, the sub-divisional officer
was killed in a bomb blast.

322
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,375
Today, they didn't let the princess go.

323
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:48,375
I think the people are revolting.

324
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:54,917
That's why the government has sent
a new inspector to our station.

325
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:57,458
He's a little dangerous.

326
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,958
He will thoroughly investigate
this matter.

327
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,125
Your Majesty.

328
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,792
We'll search all the villages.

329
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:32,917
No matter where they're hiding,
we'll find them and we'll kill them.

330
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:01,667
We'll take care of it, Your Majesty.

331
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,958
You don't need to worry...

332
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,833
-or be afraid.
-What?

333
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:09,750
"Don't be afraid"?

334
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:14,000
You're telling me not to be afraid?

335
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:19,333
The police should be afraid, not me.

336
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:21,708
Now get to work.

337
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,417
Who is it?

338
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,792
Dad, it's me, Prathap.

339
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:57,083
<i>Did they bring her back home?</i>

340
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,292
What's your decision?

341
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,000
She'll be there after Dasehra.

342
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:04,875
Till then you look after the registration
of the lands in the city.

343
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:08,042
-I'll send the papers with Siddha.
-Okay, Dad.

344
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:11,208
Do you want us to come there for Dasehra?

345
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:12,792
<i>Not now, Prathap.</i>

346
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:16,333
I'll call you when
the situation calms down.

347
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,875
-Is everything okay over there?
<i>-Yes, Dad.</i>

348
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:25,000
-What did he say?
-She'll come here after Dasehra.

349
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:29,917
Whenever something happens,
he refuses to leave the fort.

350
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,750
And she ends up suffering.

351
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,125
By the way, somebody had called for you.

352
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,042
Who?

353
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:39,458
Somebody called... Saarayaa.

354
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,375
Not "Saarayaa." It's Sarayya.

355
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,583
What did he say?

356
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:45,375
He said he wants to talk to Dad.

357
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:46,583
Idiot!

358
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,833
He's in love with a girl
but he's afraid of marrying her.

359
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:52,208
He wants me to help him.

360
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:55,042
And will you?

361
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,208
If they are in love, they can get
married on their own, Barathi.

362
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,750
-Shall we go to the fort?
-No way!

363
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:04,083
-I won't go there.
-Come on, don't be scared.

364
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:05,583
I have an idea.

365
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,167
Chandri?

366
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,875
Yes, Your Highness?

367
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:18,958
Siddha is going to Hyderabad, right?
Please give this to him

368
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,500
so that he can buy something for himself.

369
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:21,833
Okay, Your Highness.

370
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,333
I wanted to give these
to Prathap in person.

371
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:33,625
-Please ask Siddha to take these.
-Okay, Your Highness.

372
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:57,500
"You touched my heart.

373
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:00,875
I come to you, leaving everything behind."

374
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,542
Rain, rain,
Fill our stomachs with water

375
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:08,958
Rain, rain,
Fill our stomachs with water

376
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:10,875
Fill our pots with water

377
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:13,042
Fill our pots with water

378
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,167
Rain, rain,
Fill our stomachs with water

379
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,667
Rain, rain,
Fill our stomachs with water

380
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,833
Fill our pots with water

381
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,542
<i>The raindrops sing a song</i>

382
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,292
<i>The rainbow stretches across the sky</i>

383
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,125
<i>The waves touch the shore</i>

384
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,833
<i>The thunder roars loudly</i>

385
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:45,000
<i>Kids jump like frogs in the rain</i>

386
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,625
<i>Kids jump like frogs in the rain</i>

387
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,583
<i>The raindrops sing a song</i>

388
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,250
<i>The rainbow stretches across the sky</i>

389
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,000
<i>The waves touch the shore</i>

390
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:56,792
<i>The thunder roars loudly</i>

391
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,917
<i>Kids jump like frogs in the rain</i>

392
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,500
<i>Kids jump like frogs in the rain</i>

393
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:07,417
<i>Is our love coming alive?</i>

394
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,708
<i>Is our love coming alive?</i>

395
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:14,375
<i>Is our love coming alive?</i>

396
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:17,708
<i>Is our love coming alive?</i>

397
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,250
<i>Climb the tallest tree...</i>

398
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,875
<i>Climb the tallest tree</i>
<i>For the most succulent fruit</i>

399
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:28,417
<i>The cuckoo sings</i>
<i>Sitting on the branch of that tree</i>

400
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,167
<i>Fly away, birdie</i>

401
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,375
<i>The sound of your wings</i>
<i>Will shatter the walls of this fort</i>

402
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,083
<i>Break all the shackles</i>

403
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:41,000
<i>Break all the shackles</i>
<i>And find your path</i>

404
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:47,667
<i>Your smile is breathtaking</i>
<i>And your hair luscious</i>

405
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,167
<i>Your gait intoxicating</i>
<i>While your heart is filled with kindness</i>

406
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:53,417
<i>Let go of the fear</i>

407
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,417
<i>Let go of the fear</i>
<i>And leave everything behind</i>

408
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,250
It's pouring heavily, isn't it?

409
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:13,708
Why are you singing the rain song?
It's not even monsoon!

410
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:21,792
Stop dancing in front of the fort!
Go away!

411
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,042
Planting that bomb was a grave mistake.

412
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,042
You thought you could get away with it?

413
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:38,833
We won't spare anybody.

414
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,083
Run.

415
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,417
Our next target is Shankar.

416
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,625
Send the search team as soon as possible.

417
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:11,417
Sir, there's a small problem.

418
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,792
We still don't know who stopped
the princess from leaving the village.

419
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:17,042
-It wasn't Shankar's brigade?
-No.

420
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,375
Perhaps there's another brigade.

421
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:21,500
Let's get serious about this.

422
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,292
The movement has taken many brave souls.

423
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,458
Leaving behind nothing
but bullet-riddled bodies.

424
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,708
There's no other way.

425
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:56,500
Only sacrifices can change this system.

426
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:07,333
But remember, a few clouds
cannot discourage the sun.

427
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:13,833
Go.

428
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,708
Go and start questioning
the lords in your villages.

429
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:23,375
Mark an end to this slavery.

430
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,958
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!

431
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:29,750
Dear?

432
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,083
Devaki!

433
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:34,667
Devaki...

434
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,042
-What is the princess doing?
-Your Highness?

435
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:38,750
Dad?

436
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:41,375
You've been sending them poems
since you were a kid, right?

437
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,792
They've finally recognized your talent.

438
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:46,833
Look.

439
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,000
They published your poem.

440
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:52,792
Sir, she is a very clever girl.

441
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:56,042
She has definitely taken after you!

442
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,750
In fact, she is the cleverest girl
in our district.

443
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:04,708
Let's go.

444
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,542
<i>My dear...</i>

445
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:13,292
<i>I am the dream</i>

446
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:14,792
<i>And you are its form</i>

447
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:16,333
<i>I am the cloud</i>

448
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:18,125
<i>And you are the rain</i>

449
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:19,792
<i>I am the night</i>

450
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,625
<i>And you are the moon</i>

451
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:57,833
<i>"You came to me,</i>
<i>erasing all the borders.</i>

452
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,292
<i>I found you, by bending the light.</i>

453
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,208
<i>You got me excited about your poems.</i>

454
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:26,375
<i>I am looking for you,</i>
<i>with my heart wide open."</i>

455
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,500
Hey! How dare you!

456
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,708
-Oh, God!
-Your Majesty!

457
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:52,417
-Please forgive him, Your Majesty.
-I beg you!

458
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,958
-Please forgive us.
-He didn't know.

459
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:58,292
-Forgive him, Your Majesty.
-Please forgive him.

460
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:06,208
<i>All the galaxies in the universe</i>
<i>Are smiling</i>

461
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:10,417
<i>All the birds are singing</i>

462
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,000
<i>All the galaxies in the universe</i>
<i>Are smiling</i>

463
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:19,000
<i>All the birds are singing</i>

464
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:23,208
<i>The flowers in the garden are blooming</i>

465
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:27,500
<i>The stars are twinkling brightly</i>
<i>In the night sky</i>

466
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:32,000
<i>Our youth is breaking all the shackles</i>
<i>And running free</i>

467
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:19,333
<i>The princess is falling in love</i>

468
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:23,917
<i>Walking the path of passion with joy</i>

469
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:36,500
<i>The princess is falling in love</i>

470
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:40,833
<i>Walking the path of passion with joy</i>

471
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:44,833
<i>Her heart is overflowing with desires</i>

472
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:49,667
<i>She longs to see him every day</i>

473
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:54,250
<i>He who comes running,</i>
<i>Just to see her smile</i>

474
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:59,167
<i>All the galaxies in the universe</i>
<i>Are smiling...</i>

475
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:07,458
<i>All the galaxies in the universe</i>
<i>Are smiling...</i>

476
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:11,583
<i>All the birds are singing...</i>

477
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,042
Do you like it?

478
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:14,958
Then keep it.

479
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,625
What will I do
with this sari, Your Highness?

480
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:21,083
Wear it on the day of Dasehra.

481
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:25,625
I can't enter the fort wearing a new sari.

482
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:28,708
What if someone finds out?

483
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:33,000
<i>The moon shines in the night sky</i>

484
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:37,750
<i>And you glow in its light</i>

485
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:50,167
<i>The moon shines in the night sky</i>

486
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,708
<i>And you glow in its light</i>

487
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:58,792
<i>The colors of the rainbow</i>
<i>Seem dull without you</i>

488
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:03,292
<i>The flowers lose their fragrance</i>
<i>Without you</i>

489
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:07,292
<i>I think about you all the time</i>
<i>It's a love I can't explain</i>

490
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:11,500
<i>All the galaxies in the universe</i>
<i>Are smiling</i>

491
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:15,750
<i>All the birds are singing</i>

492
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:20,083
<i>The flowers in the garden are blooming</i>

493
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:24,250
<i>The stars are twinkling brightly</i>
<i>In the night sky</i>

494
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:28,708
<i>Our youth is breaking all the shackles</i>
<i>And running free</i>

495
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,625
-Here.
-What happened, dear?

496
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,583
Nothing, Dad.
I'll eat later.

497
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,333
Are you okay, dear?

498
00:52:54,417 --> 00:52:56,458
Yes, Dad.
It's just a headache.

499
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:15,833
It's pouring heavily.
Let me call Chandri.

500
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:17,708
You don't need to, Dad.

501
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:20,958
Then cover yourself with a blanket
when you sleep, okay?

502
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,000
Whose book is this?

503
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:28,625
Prathap sent it for me, Dad.

504
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,958
Really? Okay.

505
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,333
Good night, dear.

506
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:41,375
Who's that guy?

507
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:45,042
There's a painter named Iloni.
He's his son.

508
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:49,500
The dogs are barking.

509
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,708
The police are on the lookout.

510
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:53,708
I'll talk to His Majesty in the morning.

511
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,000
You should leave.

512
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:58,583
Be careful when you talk to him.

513
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:00,875
I hope he listens to you.

514
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:03,292
If not, we'll come back to talk to him.

515
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,667
We can't fight His Majesty.
Please don't do this.

516
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:45,875
He never owned the lands.

517
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:48,250
He took them forcibly.

518
00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:51,875
We've been serving them for generations.

519
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:55,083
If no one fights back,
we'll die of hunger.

520
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,167
You're going to get us killed!

521
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:59,333
If he finds out
that you met the party members,

522
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:01,333
he'll order the police to kill us!

523
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:04,833
Please listen to me!
Think about your family!

524
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,667
That land belongs to my ancestors.

525
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:14,125
Let go of it.

526
00:56:14,542 --> 00:56:16,875
You rascal! What are you saying?

527
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,625
How dare you talk like that to him!

528
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,792
Your ancestors lived on his land as well.

529
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,542
-And now--
-Bramayya!

530
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:25,833
Keep quiet.

531
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,250
Maybe he's not being
able to feed his family.

532
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,125
It's my duty to help him.

533
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,042
Where else will he go?

534
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:40,458
Yaadhi, go harvest the field.

535
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:42,417
It's your land.

536
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:46,000
I just want you
and your family to be happy.

537
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:50,042
Go, live your life.

538
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,792
Are you really letting go of the lands?

539
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:05,417
Let go of them?

540
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:08,875
Is that what I am supposed to do?

541
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:12,417
I will ask Siddha to take care of it.

542
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:05,917
Your Highness...

543
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:09,958
your brother sent these
new clothes and jewelry with Siddha.

544
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:11,917
It's Dasehra.

545
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:13,625
Make sure you wash your hair.

546
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,250
You can wear these for the celebration.

547
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,042
<i>My dreams are filled with anxiety</i>

548
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:31,625
<i>The excitement in my heart</i>
<i>Knows no bounds</i>

549
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:35,167
<i>My dreams are filled with anxiety</i>

550
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,125
<i>I am thrilled</i>

551
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:42,417
<i>My dreams are filled with anxiety</i>

552
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,958
<i>The excitement in my heart</i>
<i>Knows no bounds</i>

553
00:58:46,042 --> 00:58:49,500
<i>My dreams are filled with anxiety</i>

554
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:52,542
<i>There are new desires in my heart</i>

555
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:58,417
<i>I feel free</i>
<i>Inside this cage of loneliness</i>

556
00:58:58,542 --> 00:59:04,375
<i>My imagination has taken a new flight</i>

557
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,792
<i>Resting into the lap of anxiety...</i>

558
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:19,792
<i>My life is in the search of</i>
<i>Mystic pleasures</i>

559
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:24,875
<i>My mind is filled with tempting thoughts</i>

560
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:28,375
<i>They are teasing me to death</i>

561
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:33,417
<i>I am overwhelmed</i>
<i>With this warm feeling</i>

562
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:39,625
<i>The blush on my cheeks</i>

563
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:43,083
<i>Sends shivers down my spine</i>

564
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:47,875
<i>My eyes convey what my heart cannot</i>

565
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:53,875
<i>This feeling inside my little heart</i>

566
00:59:54,042 --> 00:59:57,458
<i>Makes me glow like the moon</i>

567
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:02,458
<i>Bringing a bright smile on my face</i>

568
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:25,833
We've ordered everything for Dasehra.

569
01:00:26,792 --> 01:00:29,833
It will be a grand celebration this year.

570
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:34,792
The princess wants to go to the garden
for a while, Your Majesty.

571
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:36,833
What?

572
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:39,417
All the ladies will be there
with holy flowerpots.

573
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,042
All of them will be looking
at the princess.

574
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,167
Don't let her go.

575
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:39,875
<i>I don't know where my desires</i>
<i>Are taking me</i>

576
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:43,875
<i>But I am following them</i>

577
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:48,708
<i>They are making my heart rejoice</i>

578
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:55,750
<i>I'm in a state of bliss</i>

579
01:02:56,583 --> 01:03:03,292
<i>It's intoxicating</i>

580
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:08,208
<i>Every inch of me is trembling</i>

581
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:12,083
<i>It's making me float in ecstasy</i>

582
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:17,208
<i>The rush is confusing</i>
<i>Yet enchanting</i>

583
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:23,333
<i>The blush on my cheeks</i>

584
01:03:23,417 --> 01:03:26,542
<i>Sends shivers down my spine</i>

585
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,125
<i>My eyes convey what my heart cannot</i>

586
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:37,458
<i>This feeling inside my little heart</i>

587
01:03:37,792 --> 01:03:40,958
<i>Makes me glow like the moon</i>

588
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:45,792
<i>Bringing a bright smile on my face</i>

589
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:13,167
It feels so good.

590
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:16,500
I have never been this happy.

591
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:21,250
Because here, there are no walls
restricting you.

592
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:30,375
I had no idea that the fort
looked this beautiful at night.

593
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:33,625
I think it looks more beautiful today.

594
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,083
Because you're here.

595
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:42,125
What do you like about me?

596
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:44,875
I...

597
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:51,000
The fact that you wait
by my window every night.

598
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:53,292
I like that.

599
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:57,083
What do you like about me?

600
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:01,542
I...

601
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:06,583
The fact that you come to the window
to look at me.

602
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:08,125
I like that.

603
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:13,917
What's your name?

604
01:05:18,083 --> 01:05:19,167
And you...

605
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,417
Well, you're the princess.

606
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,375
No.

607
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:27,792
I am Devaki.

608
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:29,333
No.

609
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:31,833
You are...

610
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:34,042
my princess.

611
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:42,167
My dad wants me to go to Hyderabad,

612
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:44,917
to stay at my brother's place.

613
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:46,583
I won't let you go.

614
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,250
That day...

615
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:55,042
I placed those rocks on the street

616
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,375
and stopped you from leaving the village.

617
01:05:58,708 --> 01:05:59,875
I'll do that again.

618
01:06:07,542 --> 01:06:10,667
I have the red scarf you lost.

619
01:06:12,042 --> 01:06:13,042
The scarf...

620
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:17,000
The one you lost in the garden.

621
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,542
Yes.

622
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:24,125
It's not an ordinary scarf.

623
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,500
It belonged to my mother.

624
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:30,625
It was her favorite scarf.

625
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:33,833
I am sorry.

626
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:36,667
I'll give it back to you.

627
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:41,833
It's okay.

628
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,083
You can keep it.

629
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:55,958
Your Highness.

630
01:08:57,583 --> 01:08:58,625
Who's that?

631
01:08:59,417 --> 01:09:00,625
A police officer.

632
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:09,958
I'll take your leave.

633
01:09:18,042 --> 01:09:19,208
Your Majesty!

634
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:23,167
-Did you prepare the meat?
-Yes, I did.

635
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:25,792
Good.

636
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:29,542
Pack some meat for Ameen
along with two bottles of brandy.

637
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,167
Okay.
Your Majesty...

638
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,208
It's Dasehra.

639
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:36,125
The princess is very fond
of the blue jays.

640
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,917
Shall I take her to the garden?

641
01:09:39,083 --> 01:09:39,958
Okay.

642
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:42,750
-But don't let her stay out late.
-Okay.

643
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,917
You went to see him
without knowing the consequences.

644
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:17,333
It was a grave mistake.

645
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:20,792
I have seen you grow up.

646
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:22,708
That's why I didn't inform your father.

647
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:25,750
If he finds out that he touched you...

648
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:27,917
he will kill him.

649
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:34,208
I am waiting for your word.

650
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,208
Tell me what to do.

651
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,417
I touched him too, right?

652
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:47,917
What you've done is enough.

653
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:50,625
Let him go.

654
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:22,125
What were you thinking
when you went to the fort every night?

655
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,000
Look at those wounds.

656
01:12:25,167 --> 01:12:26,833
They seem like a mob thrashed him.

657
01:12:28,292 --> 01:12:30,417
He never tells us anything.

658
01:12:32,042 --> 01:12:34,250
He should've never done this.

659
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:37,167
He has put all of us in trouble.

660
01:12:37,417 --> 01:12:38,667
That's enough.

661
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:40,958
I'll make sure he stays home.
Stop yelling at him.

662
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:44,458
This is what's spoiling him.
Stop pampering him.

663
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:47,667
If he stays here,
he'll create more trouble.

664
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,500
-Send him away tomorrow.
-Stop it!

665
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:53,125
Leave him alone, will you?

666
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:46,500
WE DECLARE A 48-HOUR CURFEW
IN THE MEMORY OF OUR MARTYRS

667
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,583
Have no fear, comrades.

668
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:58,458
This land has become more fertile
with the blood of our martyrs.

669
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,125
Comrade Yaadhi was murdered,
but he fought till his last breath.

670
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:08,833
And his murderers will stand accused
in the court very soon.

671
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:15,417
To protest the murders of our brothers...

672
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:18,250
we're declaring a 48-hour curfew.

673
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:20,375
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!

674
01:14:20,458 --> 01:14:22,458
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!

675
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,667
There won't be any buses now.
You can leave after two days.

676
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,250
-Long live...
-Comrade Yaadhi.

677
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,292
-Long live...
-Comrade Aravanna.

678
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:33,333
-Long live...
-Comrade Tulasi Ram.

679
01:14:33,417 --> 01:14:35,375
-Long live...
-Comrade Aravanna.

680
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:37,458
-Long live...
-Comrade Tulasi Ram.

681
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:39,792
-Long live...
-Comrade Somanna.

682
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,292
Where did you buy this shirt?
It looks good.

683
01:14:51,042 --> 01:14:52,125
His Majesty's son...

684
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:54,625
Sometimes he sends clothes
for me from the city.

685
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:56,958
He also gives me money when he's here.

686
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,042
Your father might be
in the fort right now.

687
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,542
You can go see him, right?

688
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:13,667
Stop beating around the bush.
Tell me what you want.

689
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:15,708
Actually...

690
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:18,417
The thing is...

691
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:21,417
It won't be appropriate if I go, right?

692
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:27,083
Can you please go to the fort...

693
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:30,417
-and see how the princess is doing?
-You fool!

694
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,917
Be grateful that
Siddha didn't kill you.

695
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,708
But if he sees you again, he will.

696
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:36,917
You said you were leaving, right?

697
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:39,833
I thought you got over her.

698
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:41,833
I wasn't going to leave forever.

699
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:46,333
I know he thrashed me, but...

700
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:47,500
Stupid!

701
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,958
If he sees me with you, he'll kill me.

702
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:50,750
I never want to see you again!

703
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:07,250
I just saw that guy, Your Highness.

704
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:36,083
You can't forget him, can you?

705
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:40,292
I serve you.

706
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:45,125
But I am also a woman,
just like you.

707
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:48,208
Let me tell you something.

708
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:51,333
My mother was also a servant.

709
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,625
She gave birth to me in this fort.

710
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,292
She used to tell me...

711
01:16:56,792 --> 01:16:58,458
that the lords who rule,

712
01:16:58,542 --> 01:17:00,458
can even kill people
for the sake of their honor.

713
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:05,875
The lords may die,
but the lordship doesn't.

714
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:10,750
No woman in this fort
can ever wish for something.

715
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:13,208
Be it a servant...

716
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:15,042
or a princess.

717
01:17:15,958 --> 01:17:18,458
Your mother would've talked
some sense into you.

718
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:21,542
But she died when you were just a kid.

719
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:26,750
And now they'll kill that boy
because you like him.

720
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:29,083
He's also a servant's son.

721
01:17:30,667 --> 01:17:35,542
<i>My dear, my poetry is inspired by you.</i>

722
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,542
<i>You are the waves of the ocean</i>
<i>in my heart.</i>

723
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:41,500
<i>You are the rainbow</i>
<i>that stretches across the sky.</i>

724
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:44,375
<i>You are the moonshine</i>
<i>that melts the skies.</i>

725
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:48,583
<i>You are the ecstasy I want forever.</i>

726
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:54,125
We'll get caught if we post it, Raju.

727
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:57,208
But I'm stamping it for you,
without telling my father.

728
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,208
Hi, Raju.
That's a really big package.

729
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:05,667
Whom are you sending it to?

730
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:10,375
It's for my exams...
It's an application.

731
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:13,125
Very good.

732
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:17,292
You should study if you
want to stop serving the lords.

733
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:22,125
Sir.

734
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:27,167
Is His Majesty a bad man?

735
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:30,417
It doesn't matter if he's good or bad.

736
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:33,750
But he behaves exactly
the way a lord should.

737
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,792
And he's been like that
for a very long time.

738
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:56,625
So what if he is a servant's son?

739
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,667
It's me... Devaki.

740
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:08,458
Your Highness!

741
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:10,875
I'm Ramaswamy's daughter Vasantha.

742
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,583
How can I help you?

743
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:14,042
Actually...

744
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:17,375
Raju had once called me from your phone.

745
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:19,333
Yes, I remember.

746
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:22,417
Can you please ask him to call me?

747
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:25,458
Sure. I'll tell him.

748
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:28,667
He was here a few minutes ago.
He has posted a letter to you.

749
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:30,083
Really?

750
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:32,708
Okay.

751
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:35,458
Also...

752
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:40,083
Don't tell anybody that I called, okay?

753
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,167
Okay, Your Highness.

754
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:47,375
-Hello, Ramaswamy!
-Hello, sir.

755
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,833
I have a letter for the princess.

756
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,167
-For the princess?
-Yes.

757
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,458
We're all slaves to His Majesty.

758
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:04,583
But you're one lucky man!

759
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:07,250
He can neither help nor harm you.

760
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,708
I wonder if there are
more people like you.

761
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:12,667
Hey, what are you doing?

762
01:20:16,292 --> 01:20:19,167
Why did you tear it?
It was for the princess.

763
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:20,417
I know, sir.

764
01:20:20,792 --> 01:20:23,333
-But there are obscene pictures in it.
-What?

765
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,333
The princess is growing up.

766
01:20:25,917 --> 01:20:27,167
It is not good for her.

767
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:04,000
Are you feeling bad?

768
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:08,125
I thought you might be feeling bad
about what I said this morning.

769
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,583
That's why I came looking for you.

770
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,167
It scares me to even look at the fort.

771
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,083
But now,
you are in love with the princess.

772
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:26,375
And she loves you too.

773
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:30,250
I cannot believe this.

774
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:34,417
You are a good man, Raju.

775
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:38,292
I just don't want you to get hurt.

776
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:54,083
I thought I could live without you.

777
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:58,292
But I can't.

778
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:02,667
I had a feeling
you'll come see me today.

779
01:24:03,792 --> 01:24:05,208
Me too.

780
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:09,458
I knew you'd be thinking about me.

781
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,792
Which means... we are in love.

782
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:32,542
Are you sure... I can drink this?

783
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:08,417
When will you come again?

784
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:12,292
Whenever you think of me.

785
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,000
The rain will come tell me.

786
01:25:18,292 --> 01:25:19,375
Bye.

787
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,708
What happened, Your Highness?

788
01:27:11,083 --> 01:27:12,750
I'll go to Hyderabad.

789
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:24,875
Please don't hurt him.

790
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:55,208
<i>The fort where your laughter echoed</i>

791
01:27:55,542 --> 01:28:00,208
<i>Will now give shelter to silence</i>

792
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:04,500
<i>The celebrations are lost</i>

793
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:08,917
<i>The happiness is fading away</i>

794
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:13,125
<i>Go on, Princess</i>

795
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:17,458
<i>You've bore the burden of sorrow</i>
<i>All your life</i>

796
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:21,917
<i>No matter what you do</i>

797
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,000
<i>You won't be able to change the truth</i>

798
01:28:26,417 --> 01:28:30,542
<i>Though the pain is unbearable</i>

799
01:28:30,792 --> 01:28:34,583
<i>Stay strong, Princess</i>

800
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,125
<i>All the memories will soon fade away</i>

801
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:43,625
<i>Cherish them for one last time</i>

802
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:47,958
<i>It's a burden</i>
<i>That is too hard to carry</i>

803
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:52,208
<i>You can never break this cage</i>

804
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:56,583
<i>The memories pierce your heart</i>

805
01:28:56,708 --> 01:29:00,875
<i>And the tears roll down your cheeks</i>

806
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:05,333
<i>Pull yourself together, Princess</i>

807
01:29:05,417 --> 01:29:10,167
<i>This moment was inevitable</i>

808
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:48,583
<i>It's not easy to walk away...</i>

809
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:52,833
<i>From the love that blossomed here</i>

810
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:57,292
<i>Where you took your first steps</i>

811
01:29:57,375 --> 01:30:01,167
<i>Nobody cares about your happiness</i>

812
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:05,750
<i>But no matter how hard one tries to...</i>

813
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:09,708
<i>They won't be able to forget you</i>

814
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:14,458
<i>You fell in love, Princess</i>

815
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:17,917
<i>Let that love be your sweetest memory</i>

816
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,333
<i>Let that fire of your longing</i>

817
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:26,500
<i>Be quenched by your tears</i>

818
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:30,958
<i>No matter what you do</i>
<i>You won't be able to change the truth</i>

819
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:34,750
<i>Bring yourself to accept it</i>

820
01:30:58,083 --> 01:31:01,958
<i>Let your sorrows be your strength</i>

821
01:31:02,292 --> 01:31:06,583
<i>Go on, Princess</i>

822
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:10,792
<i>And don't look back</i>

823
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,125
<i>Just move forward, Princess</i>

824
01:31:15,417 --> 01:31:19,542
<i>Let your sorrows be your strength</i>

825
01:31:19,667 --> 01:31:23,958
<i>Keep moving forward, Princess</i>

826
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:39,792
Where were you?
The police arrested your parents.

827
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:44,125
Nobody knows why.

828
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:47,083
Perhaps His Majesty can help them.

829
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:50,000
Those morons, they took them illegally!

830
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:52,208
What if they kill them?

831
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:54,458
Go and ask His Majesty to help you.

832
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:58,000
Why are you all staring at him?

833
01:31:58,458 --> 01:32:00,375
Can't you see that he's scared
to go to the fort alone?

834
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:02,042
Somebody go with him.

835
01:32:15,667 --> 01:32:18,125
Iloni's son is here, Your Majesty.

836
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:28,083
Malli, keep him here.

837
01:32:29,542 --> 01:32:32,083
And if you let him go, I'll kill you.

838
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:33,958
Yes, Your Majesty.

839
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:43,083
-He's here.
-Raju, he's here.

840
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:55,000
Your Majesty...

841
01:32:55,292 --> 01:32:58,917
the police took Iloni and his wife.

842
01:32:59,042 --> 01:33:01,125
Please do something
to get them out of jail.

843
01:33:01,292 --> 01:33:03,583
He's their only son.

844
01:33:07,417 --> 01:33:08,792
What's your name?

845
01:33:15,667 --> 01:33:16,792
What's your name?

846
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,042
Posayya, Your Majesty.

847
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:19,917
What about you?

848
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,042
Komaram, Your Majesty.

849
01:33:23,042 --> 01:33:24,208
Nagayya, Your Majesty.

850
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:25,750
Suri, Your Majesty.

851
01:33:34,583 --> 01:33:36,708
I am sure they took them for a reason.

852
01:33:37,667 --> 01:33:38,958
What did they do?

853
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:44,292
Or did you do something?

854
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:48,958
I don't he's guilty.
He's an innocent boy.

855
01:33:49,167 --> 01:33:50,500
He moved away a long time ago.

856
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,833
He's studying and stays
at his grandma's place, Your Majesty.

857
01:33:53,625 --> 01:33:54,667
Really?

858
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:59,667
He's a student.

859
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:02,625
Good.

860
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:07,500
But you'll know what happened only
when you go to the police station, right?

861
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:12,667
Do this.

862
01:34:13,292 --> 01:34:14,750
I'll write an application for you.

863
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:16,500
Give it to Ameen.

864
01:34:17,792 --> 01:34:18,958
They have a protocol to follow.

865
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:21,625
Let's see what they do.

866
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:51,625
Let them go.

867
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:21,792
POLICE STATION

868
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,375
Don't worry. He'll be back.

869
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:04,792
I wonder if my son
has eaten anything.

870
01:36:06,917 --> 01:36:08,667
I don't know whose custody he is in.

871
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:13,458
I wonder what they might be
doing to my son.

872
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:26,750
Tell me, are you nervous
about going to America?

873
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:29,792
I am going to America?
But why?

874
01:36:30,125 --> 01:36:32,333
What? Did they not tell you?

875
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,625
Your uncle is in America, right?

876
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:38,125
Your dad told us
that he's sending you there.

877
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,833
Your brother's already
making arrangements for that.

878
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,833
-It's me, Devaki.
-Your Highness!

879
01:36:57,292 --> 01:36:59,292
I am calling from Hyderabad.

880
01:37:00,125 --> 01:37:02,042
I need a favor.

881
01:37:03,917 --> 01:37:06,542
Please find out where Raju is.

882
01:37:06,625 --> 01:37:09,000
Oh, God! You're in Hyderabad?

883
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:12,083
The police arrested Raju.

884
01:37:12,167 --> 01:37:13,083
They arrested him?

885
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:34,917
-Dad.
-I hope you had a safe journey.

886
01:37:35,042 --> 01:37:36,125
Dad...

887
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:38,667
I was scared to
tell this to you in person.

888
01:37:40,292 --> 01:37:41,625
I love him.

889
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:44,625
<i>And I left him...</i>

890
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:45,958
only for you.

891
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:47,667
For your honor.

892
01:37:48,708 --> 01:37:50,708
So that you don't hurt him
because of me.

893
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:51,750
<i>But you--</i>

894
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:45,250
Come on.

895
01:39:12,583 --> 01:39:15,167
The villagers fear me.

896
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,958
My daughter is a princess.

897
01:39:21,417 --> 01:39:22,958
And you...

898
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:29,500
Your Majesty...

899
01:39:30,792 --> 01:39:34,292
I'll always treat your daughter...
like a princess.

900
01:40:03,917 --> 01:40:06,292
You'd asked me about the charges
that need to be filed on him.

901
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:09,000
Accuse him of being a Naxalite.

902
01:40:10,125 --> 01:40:12,125
While the princess
was going to the city...

903
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:16,083
he was the one
who stopped her from leaving.

904
01:40:41,083 --> 01:40:42,042
RAMAKANTH ALIAS RAJU

905
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:45,625
ANYONE WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT HIM
WILL BE REWARDED 10,000 RUPEES.

906
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:47,583
We're Raju's friends.

907
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:49,833
If he intended
to join the Naxalites...

908
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:51,542
he would have told us, right?

909
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:54,000
Something's fishy.

910
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:58,125
I'm scared.
Raju will be safe, right?

911
01:40:58,333 --> 01:41:00,833
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

912
01:41:01,125 --> 01:41:02,292
He'll be back tomorrow.

913
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:34,792
I AM THE EARTH, YOU'RE THE SKY
I LONG FOR OUR UNION

914
01:41:36,583 --> 01:41:39,125
MY DAY IS DULL AND THE NIGHT IS GLOOMY
WITHOUT YOU

915
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:53,292
So the lord's daughter loves you, right?

916
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,083
It's okay.
You can tell me.

917
01:42:04,417 --> 01:42:05,833
She is his daughter.

918
01:42:06,667 --> 01:42:08,208
She has his blood running in her veins.

919
01:42:09,292 --> 01:42:10,333
Right?

920
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:15,208
Then what makes you think
that she loves you too?

921
01:42:18,333 --> 01:42:20,042
Our bond...

922
01:42:21,875 --> 01:42:23,375
It's not just an infatuation.

923
01:42:24,833 --> 01:42:26,000
It's love.

924
01:42:28,458 --> 01:42:29,542
What do you mean?

925
01:42:33,875 --> 01:42:35,083
Love means...

926
01:42:36,583 --> 01:42:37,583
It is love!

927
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:42,125
She lives in the fort,
yet, she had come to see me.

928
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:44,792
Is that not love?

929
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:49,833
No, it's just attraction.

930
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:52,583
It's not love.

931
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:56,125
We both know it for sure.

932
01:42:57,083 --> 01:42:58,125
It is love.

933
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,417
But this love will never win.

934
01:43:03,167 --> 01:43:06,333
And if you fight for it...
they will kill you.

935
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:16,917
You've started a revolution, right?

936
01:43:18,042 --> 01:43:19,458
You think you'll win?

937
01:43:23,167 --> 01:43:24,625
They will kill you too.

938
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:30,667
It's true.
They will kill me.

939
01:43:33,042 --> 01:43:35,500
But in a revolution,
even death is victory.

940
01:43:39,917 --> 01:43:41,083
Then...

941
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:44,792
Our love is also a revolution.

942
01:43:52,417 --> 01:43:53,458
Dad...

943
01:43:54,042 --> 01:43:57,167
Devaki is missing.

944
01:43:59,958 --> 01:44:01,333
We looked everywhere for her.

945
01:44:02,292 --> 01:44:04,292
There is a police officer I know.

946
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:06,750
I am thinking of filing a report.

947
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:11,625
Hello, Dad? Can you hear me?

948
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:16,042
Don't file a report.

949
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,125
I'll call you back.

950
01:45:15,292 --> 01:45:18,917
"The police is going to
take you both someplace.

951
01:45:19,042 --> 01:45:20,292
Don't know where."

952
01:45:21,792 --> 01:45:22,958
Does that mean...

953
01:45:24,917 --> 01:45:26,333
they are going to kill you?

954
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,625
My death is inevitable.

955
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:37,042
I don't fear it.

956
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:40,708
It will help the revolution.

957
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:47,167
But... I have planned something for you.

958
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:22,875
-Where is Raju?
-Who?

959
01:46:23,708 --> 01:46:24,583
Who is Raju?

960
01:46:31,458 --> 01:46:32,375
Pass me the bidi.

961
01:46:34,833 --> 01:46:36,833
Where is Raju?

962
01:46:37,542 --> 01:46:39,000
Where have you kept him?

963
01:46:40,875 --> 01:46:44,542
-There's no one here by that name.
-I know he is here!

964
01:46:44,625 --> 01:46:47,750
-Who are you?
-I am Devaki.

965
01:46:47,875 --> 01:46:50,750
-Where is he? Tell me.
-Who is Raju?

966
01:46:50,875 --> 01:46:53,917
There is no Raju here.
Don't you get it?

967
01:46:56,542 --> 01:46:58,500
Here... This is Raju.

968
01:46:58,583 --> 01:47:01,042
It's his photo.
Tell me, where is he?

969
01:47:01,125 --> 01:47:03,125
He's this tall and...

970
01:47:44,958 --> 01:47:46,792
You can keep this.

971
01:47:47,042 --> 01:47:50,125
Please tell me, where is he?

972
01:47:50,417 --> 01:47:51,708
Where is Raju?

973
01:47:54,208 --> 01:47:57,000
The commissioner just took him away.

974
01:47:57,542 --> 01:48:01,792
Where... Where did he take him?

975
01:48:05,042 --> 01:48:07,792
Since you are in love with him, they...

976
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,542
You are doing this for me, right?

977
01:48:42,083 --> 01:48:43,417
What if I die?

978
01:48:43,625 --> 01:48:45,958
I am not doing this for you.

979
01:48:47,042 --> 01:48:48,333
It's for the lordship.

980
01:49:17,583 --> 01:49:19,583
Go on.

981
01:49:21,333 --> 01:49:22,167
Why?

982
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:23,750
Can't you kill us here?

983
01:49:25,042 --> 01:49:26,625
Why do you have to shoot us in the back?

984
01:49:27,167 --> 01:49:29,042
There's nothing else you can do...

985
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:31,542
except kill innocent people.

986
01:49:31,917 --> 01:49:33,000
Please leave.

987
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:35,875
Don't you think that ten men against two
is a bit unfair?

988
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,250
Fight me if you have the guts!

989
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,917
Sir, it was the tire!

990
01:51:05,042 --> 01:51:06,792
Shankar...

991
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:09,833
-Shankar, get up.
-Let me be.

992
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:11,708
-You should go...
-Shankar!

993
01:51:11,792 --> 01:51:13,458
...or else, both of us will die.

994
01:51:15,792 --> 01:51:17,958
Shankar, the police are coming.

995
01:51:18,167 --> 01:51:21,208
-Let me carry you.
-No! They will kill you!

996
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:25,417
Take the princess and run away!

997
01:51:25,708 --> 01:51:27,625
-Go!
-Shankar, please--

998
01:51:27,708 --> 01:51:29,167
I said go!

999
01:51:29,625 --> 01:51:31,417
But we are almost there.

1000
01:51:31,667 --> 01:51:32,958
Don't you get it?

1001
01:51:33,042 --> 01:51:34,875
The lord's heir is fighting
against the lordship...

1002
01:51:35,042 --> 01:51:36,917
for the first time in history.

1003
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,167
She's fighting for your love.

1004
01:51:41,542 --> 01:51:44,750
And if your love wins,
it will help this society.

1005
01:51:44,833 --> 01:51:46,042
Now go!

1006
01:51:46,708 --> 01:51:49,542
Go away!

1007
01:51:51,167 --> 01:51:52,250
Go!

1008
01:51:53,875 --> 01:51:56,000
-What are you doing?
-You are losing blood.

1009
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:09,583
Leave!

1010
01:52:09,667 --> 01:52:11,125
Sir, I found them!

1011
01:52:19,458 --> 01:52:21,583
-Look!
-That's Shankar!

1012
01:54:30,208 --> 01:54:32,667
Your Majesty, the villagers...

1013
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,417
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

1014
01:54:45,542 --> 01:54:49,458
They've put up posters stating that
our son joined the Naxalites.

1015
01:54:50,333 --> 01:54:52,333
He's an innocent boy.

1016
01:54:52,458 --> 01:54:55,042
But everyone in the village
believes it to be true.

1017
01:54:55,167 --> 01:54:58,167
He's not been home for a really long time.

1018
01:54:58,375 --> 01:55:00,250
Sir, we're scared to death.

1019
01:55:00,375 --> 01:55:04,042
Sir... we are at your mercy.

1020
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:06,208
My son would never do something like that.

1021
01:55:06,375 --> 01:55:08,333
Those are false allegations.

1022
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:10,750
I don't know how to make you understand.

1023
01:55:10,917 --> 01:55:12,500
Please forgive us.

1024
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:15,792
Your Majesty, last night...

1025
01:55:16,125 --> 01:55:20,125
Bhairi saw Raju and the princess eloping.

1026
01:55:23,208 --> 01:55:25,792
He told the entire village about it.

1027
01:55:27,833 --> 01:55:29,292
I knew something was going on
between them.

1028
01:55:29,792 --> 01:55:32,625
They talked over the phone a few times.

1029
01:55:34,792 --> 01:55:37,792
Does your son think that
he's good enough for the princess?

1030
01:55:38,042 --> 01:55:40,917
How could he do this?
How dare he!

1031
01:55:41,042 --> 01:55:44,333
You son of a bitch!
How could you do this to him?

1032
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,292
Come on, answer him!

1033
01:55:47,167 --> 01:55:49,542
I knew something was wrong
when he said

1034
01:55:49,625 --> 01:55:50,583
he wanted to educate his son.

1035
01:55:50,667 --> 01:55:52,417
He had planned this from the beginning!

1036
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:55,958
You're from a lower caste, you fool.
This village has rules!

1037
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:57,500
You wanted to be kins with His Majesty?

1038
01:55:57,625 --> 01:55:59,125
You trained him so well!

1039
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:01,833
You made him join the Naxals
and entrap the princess?

1040
01:56:01,917 --> 01:56:03,708
Bloody rascals!

1041
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:05,417
You thought he would do nothing about it?

1042
01:56:07,458 --> 01:56:09,958
His Majesty doesn't fear the Naxalites.

1043
01:56:10,375 --> 01:56:11,583
Your son will get killed.

1044
01:56:11,708 --> 01:56:13,208
Did he think that His Majesty
will give us our lands

1045
01:56:13,292 --> 01:56:15,333
if he kidnaps the princess?

1046
01:56:15,792 --> 01:56:18,542
God, stop talking nonsense!

1047
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:21,625
They are young.
Maybe they do love each other.

1048
01:56:21,792 --> 01:56:24,625
Why else would she run away with him?

1049
01:56:26,292 --> 01:56:29,708
Hey, what are you saying, you witch?
Don't you fear His Majesty?

1050
01:56:29,958 --> 01:56:32,542
He's our god.
He's everything we have.

1051
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:34,250
So what if they love each other?

1052
01:56:34,417 --> 01:56:35,917
They don't have the right to elope!

1053
01:56:38,708 --> 01:56:41,000
There's no way
they can leave this village!

1054
01:56:41,083 --> 01:56:42,750
We have to find them!

1055
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:43,667
Let's go.

1056
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:37,042
<i>A new ray of hope...</i>

1057
01:57:37,125 --> 01:57:43,708
<i>Is sprinkling a sweet fragrance</i>
<i>Over our hearts</i>

1058
01:57:44,667 --> 01:57:52,042
<i>A strange dizziness...</i>

1059
01:57:52,292 --> 01:57:58,125
<i>Is leading us into paradise</i>

1060
01:57:59,458 --> 01:58:02,875
<i>Every inch of our bodies is trembling</i>

1061
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,917
<i>It's making us fly high</i>

1062
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:13,250
<i>Our love is unfurling</i>
<i>In this sweet high</i>

1063
01:58:46,958 --> 01:58:48,292
Dad...

1064
01:58:48,792 --> 01:58:49,917
Tell me.

1065
01:58:51,417 --> 01:58:52,583
I heard what happened.

1066
01:58:55,833 --> 01:58:58,958
Please... stay strong.

1067
01:59:25,333 --> 01:59:28,625
It seems like Dad is very upset.

1068
01:59:31,542 --> 01:59:37,208
I think it would be better...
if you go see him once.

1069
01:59:44,542 --> 01:59:45,792
What you both did...

1070
01:59:46,708 --> 01:59:48,042
it wasn't right.

1071
01:59:49,833 --> 01:59:52,167
But it's already done.

1072
01:59:56,625 --> 01:59:58,833
I will talk to the police.

1073
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:00,625
You don't need to worry.

1074
02:00:06,542 --> 02:00:07,917
Did the bullet hit you?

1075
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,125
No.

1076
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:11,917
No, Your Highness.

1077
02:00:12,583 --> 02:00:14,292
You don't need to address me that way.

1078
02:00:17,583 --> 02:00:19,125
What are your plans for the future?

1079
02:00:19,917 --> 02:00:21,708
I want to teach.

1080
02:00:22,167 --> 02:00:24,542
-He's a great poet.
-Good.

1081
02:01:27,917 --> 02:01:30,458
I told you my brother loves me a lot.

1082
02:01:32,583 --> 02:01:34,500
He makes sure he buys me this soft drink

1083
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:35,958
because he knows I love it.

1084
02:02:06,292 --> 02:02:07,583
Don't get out of the car.

1085
02:02:08,250 --> 02:02:09,708
The police might see you.

1086
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:13,917
I'll go talk to them about your case.

1087
02:03:02,042 --> 02:03:04,583
At first, the police refused
to listen to me.

1088
02:03:04,792 --> 02:03:06,333
But it's all good now.

1089
02:03:40,333 --> 02:03:41,167
Prathap...

1090
02:05:59,458 --> 02:06:01,167
<i>I thought I could live without you.</i>

1091
02:06:01,875 --> 02:06:04,167
<i>But I can't.</i>

1092
02:06:04,875 --> 02:06:08,083
<i>I had a feeling</i>
<i>you'll come see me today.</i>

1093
02:06:08,625 --> 02:06:10,167
<i>Me too.</i>

1094
02:06:10,625 --> 02:06:13,083
<i>I knew you'd be thinking about me.</i>

1095
02:06:13,417 --> 02:06:15,667
<i>Which means... we are in love.</i>

1096
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:45,792
Raju won.

1097
02:06:49,292 --> 02:06:50,583
But it was Raju alone who won.

1098
02:06:52,417 --> 02:06:55,542
He won the moment the princess stepped
out of the fort for the sake of his love.

1099
02:07:09,833 --> 02:07:16,000
<i>All the galaxies in the universe</i>
<i>Are smiling</i>

1100
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:21,708
<i>All the birds are singing</i>

1101
02:07:22,750 --> 02:07:28,250
<i>All the galaxies in the universe</i>
<i>Are smiling</i>

1102
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:34,292
<i>All the birds are singing</i>

1103
02:07:35,667 --> 02:07:42,000
<i>The flowers in the garden are blooming</i>

1104
02:07:42,208 --> 02:07:48,500
<i>The stars are twinkling brightly</i>
<i>In the night sky</i>

1105
02:07:48,583 --> 02:07:54,667
<i>Our youth is breaking all the shackles</i>
<i>And running free</i>

1106
02:09:18,208 --> 02:09:20,333
<i>This is not just the</i>
<i>story of Raju and Devaki</i>

1107
02:09:20,417 --> 02:09:22,333
<i>who were killed in the name of honor.</i>

1108
02:09:22,875 --> 02:09:25,792
<i>It's the story of many lovers,</i>
<i>who are still being killed.</i>

1109
02:09:26,417 --> 02:09:29,542
<i>This land is soaked with the blood</i>
<i>of those who were in love.</i>

1110
02:09:30,083 --> 02:09:31,833
<i>Witnessing this tragedy...</i>

1111
02:09:32,292 --> 02:09:35,167
<i>might bring a change</i>
<i>and that's the only hope with which...</i>

1112
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:36,750
<i>I penned the story of this film.</i>
