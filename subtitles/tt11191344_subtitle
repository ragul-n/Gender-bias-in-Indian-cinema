1
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,583
Checking out the girl in the yellow dress?

2
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,167
Her name is Mahima.

3
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:31,167
She is the Creative Head
at Dream Ads.

4
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,625
<i>We work in the same apartment building.</i>

5
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,125
<i>Her office is on the tenth floor.</i>

6
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:47,375
<i>I see her in the elevator every morning.</i>

7
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,458
<i>Our working hours are different.</i>

8
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,125
<i>If I miss that chance,
I don't get to see her again on that day.</i>

9
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,000
We either decide whether
a girl is right for us or not

10
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,875
and spend some time with her…

11
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,958
or we spend some time with a girl
and then take a decision.

12
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,792
<i>However, neither holds
true in this girl's case.</i>

13
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,500
<i>The moment I saw her, I realized…</i>

14
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,500
<i>that she is the one!</i>

15
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,958
<i>I used to be alone
with her in the elevator…</i>

16
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,375
<i>for about ten seconds
after everyone got off.</i>

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,500
<i>Initially,
she didn't bother to talk to me,</i>

18
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:29,667
<i>but after a few days…</i>

19
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:31,875
<i>she started noticing me.</i>

20
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,667
<i>So, I finally broke the silence
and asked her…</i>

21
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,000
Can I take you out for a cup of coffee?

22
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:13,542
You've never introduced
yourself and we've never talked…

23
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,708
-yet, you're asking me out for a coffee!
-True…

24
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,792
but this coffee date is to introduce
ourselves and talk for ten minutes.

25
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,708
You didn't answer my question.

26
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,500
That's because your question is wrong.

27
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,458
I'll come only if you
ask the right question.

28
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,375
What did she even mean?

29
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,083
She could've simply said, "yes" or "no"
for the date. This is just strange.

30
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,875
I'll tell you later. Okay, bye.

31
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,458
Can I take you out for a cup of coffee?

32
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,750
Sorry, my bad!

33
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:06,333
I think, you are a feminist.

34
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,542
So, will you take me
out for a cup of coffee?

35
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,958
Shall we go out for a cup of coffee?

36
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:23,875
You are avoiding me on purpose, right?

37
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,250
You can say no if you don't want to come.

38
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:29,458
I swear… still, your question is wrong.

39
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,583
If you ask me the right
question, I'll definitely agree.

40
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:35,625
Bye!

41
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,208
Can I take you out?

42
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,250
Will you take me out for a cup…

43
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,083
Shall we go out for a cup of…

44
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:24,042
I swear, I've never had to think
so much even for a project.

45
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,667
It's okay if you don't
want to come with me,

46
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,667
but please tell me what
the right question is.

47
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,500
Tea!

48
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,375
The right question is,
"Can I take you out for a cup of tea?"

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,292
Because I hate coffee!

50
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:54,833
-Three days.
-Actually,

51
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:56,167
-my sense of humor--
-No, it's okay.

52
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,125
Never mind. It's my mistake.

53
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:03,917
Tea!

54
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:09,208
Why not!

55
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,167
Shall we go… for a cup of tea?

56
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:13,792
Yeah.

57
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,542
Tea.

58
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,583
Tea?

59
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,083
Cute, right?

60
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,875
You think it's cute because a girl
said that. Had I said the same thing,

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,167
you would've embarrassed me
in front of all our friends.

62
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,250
Of course! Girls can be a little innocent.

63
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:34,833
-I am Sid--
-Siddharth.

64
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,292
Civil engineer.

65
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,708
You are into construction.

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,167
You don't smoke or drink.

67
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,333
You like bikes and cars.

68
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:45,542
How do you know all this?

69
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,375
You got the information
about the person you like.

70
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,625
So, I just did the same thing.

71
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,417
Hi.

72
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,750
Sorry, I got late.

73
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,625
It's okay.

74
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,375
I used to get to see her…

75
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,208
just for a few seconds, and now…

76
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:16,833
even if I get late, she waits for me.
See how far I've come.

77
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,417
Then, why wait? Just propose to her.

78
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,083
She found out everything
about me on her own.

79
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,625
So, now, I'll wait 'til she gets
to know me completely.

80
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,208
She'll leave no stone unturned if she
realizes that I am the one for her.

81
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,375
She'll propose to me.

82
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,250
<i>A strange incident has taken
place in Bhuvaneshwar</i>

83
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,917
<i>at around 3:00 a.m. this morning.</i>

84
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,125
<i>We all must have heard of money
being stolen from the ATM,</i>

85
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:55,708
<i>but in this case, a gang of seven
people has stolen the entire ATM.</i>

86
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,083
<i>The bank has informed us that…</i>

87
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,750
<i>the ATM was loaded with
cash more than 20 lakhs</i>

88
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,667
<i>just an hour before
the incident took place.</i>

89
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,125
<i>The police are looking for the culprits.</i>

90
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,250
Why are you showing this to me?

91
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,375
To know if you like the news anchor.

92
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,250
Don't ask me these silly questions!

93
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:17,125
Do you know who stole that
ATM with 25 lakh rupees?

94
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,208
My partner.

95
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,208
It's 25 lakhs, boss.
That's a lot of cash.

96
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,417
-What's that?
-It's nothing.

97
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,458
We thought we could steal the money on
the spot, so we hit it hard with a rod,

98
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:01,542
but we could not open it.

99
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,583
Only a person who knows the mechanism
of an ATM can open it.

100
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,917
-Boss, yours is big.
-What?

101
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,292
I mean, your circle is big.
That's why, we got it here.

102
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,875
It is not possible at this time.

103
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,375
You won't get any mechanic
until Monday afternoon.

104
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:23,458
But it is not safe to keep
it here until then.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,458
I have a warehouse.
We will keep it there.

106
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,458
For safety.

107
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,042
-What about them?
-Who?

108
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,042
Five more people are
involved in this work.

109
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,125
If any of them gets caught,
we'll be at risk.

110
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,417
We have to get rid of them immediately
by giving them a lakh each.

111
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,250
Just give us five lakhs, boss.
We will take care of the rest.

112
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,167
Five lakhs?

113
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,833
Let it be. Let's go.

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,833
-Partner, wait.
-How is it fair?

115
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,875
We're supposed to trust
him with 25 lakhs,

116
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,167
-but he can't trust us with five lakhs!
-Don't be mad, brother.

117
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:57,417
I will give it to you.

118
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,667
Shankar!

119
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,292
Here are five lakhs.

120
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,792
Boss, you have to open
the machine in front of us.

121
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,250
Sure, brother.

122
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:14,625
Twenty for five!

123
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,000
The money is in the upper chest,
and they were hitting the lower chest.

124
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:17,917
Fools!

125
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,833
-Hello.
-Did the mechanic come?

126
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,750
Not yet, brother.

127
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,375
I'll call you once he's here.

128
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,417
I hope you remember.

129
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,250
You have to open it in front of us.

130
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,167
Sure, I will get it opened
in front of you. Okay?

131
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:40,417
"You have to open it in front of us."

132
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,542
Mechanic, keep two sets of 2,000-rupee
and 500-rupee notes separately.

133
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,125
Put your brains in the museum.

134
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,583
-What is it?
-Twenty-five lakhs, my foot!

135
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,083
There's nothing else inside.

136
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,458
You guys are the fools, not them.

137
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,583
This is not an ATM.

138
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,833
This is a dummy.

139
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,125
-Son.
-Dad.

140
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,417
Listen!

141
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:18,583
Did you order any snacks?

142
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,750
No, partner.

143
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,667
Then, what are they coming here for?

144
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,167
Momos!

145
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,208
How can you fool us by
showing us a dummy machine!

146
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,167
If you don't give us back the money,
we will complain to the police!

147
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:38,667
Let's go to the police, Dad!

148
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,875
Let's go!

149
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,333
-Let's go, Dad!
-Yes! Go, Dad.

150
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,667
Go, Dad!

151
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:49,208
If you go to the police,
you will get caught along with us.

152
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,167
Silly fellow!

153
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,500
Traitors!

154
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,500
If we are the traitors…

155
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:00,792
who are you?

156
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,625
How did you find out that
there is no money in the ATM…

157
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,333
if you didn't open the machine?

158
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,875
Come on, tell us!

159
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:13,500
Dad!

160
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,625
Idiot!

161
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,417
Who is good and who is bad
in this world? Tell me.

162
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,042
We all were born in the same way.

163
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,875
So, everyone's the same.

164
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:30,292
-At least, give us half the amount.
-We don't even have 50 paise.

165
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,583
We spent all your money.

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,917
-Did you guys really spend all the money?
-Yes!

167
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,458
But how?

168
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,458
<i>Pretty girl! Where are you from?</i>

169
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,875
<i>You seem to be lonely
Why don't you come with me to Bheemili?</i>

170
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,000
<i>With galore of dreams
I stepped out of my home</i>

171
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,125
<i>Men have cheated on me
So, I left my family</i>

172
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,458
<i>Dear, share your pain with me
And see it go away</i>

173
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:04,042
<i>There is one man
Who can help you fix your life</i>

174
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,750
Really? Where is that man?

175
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,750
Ask your hero to show up in front of me.

176
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,000
<i>In a passenger train with 12 coaches</i>

177
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,458
<i>He said we shall go to Bombay
At eleven o'clock</i>

178
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,958
<i>I had to come secretly to the station
As I was worried, people will see me</i>

179
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:00,250
<i>At 1:30, the train would arrive
On platform nine</i>

180
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,667
<i>He showed me the window seat
Of an AC compartment</i>

181
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,000
<i>He slowly comforted me with a warm blanket</i>

182
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,875
<i>There is nothing in store
As the night falls</i>

183
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,250
<i>Except the sirens of the train</i>

184
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:18,000
<i>He heated up the ambiance
And left me to my fate</i>

185
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,583
<i>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Don't jump around hither tither!</i>

186
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:24,750
<i>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Just come with me to the beach!</i>

187
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,167
<i>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
If I ruin your place…</i>

188
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,542
<i>I will get to know everything
With the pull of a string</i>

189
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,125
<i>As I pulled the chain
Someone called for me</i>

190
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,333
<i>Cut to this scene
And I am in Chennai</i>

191
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:17,750
<i>The story is interesting
What happened next?</i>

192
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,042
<i>Did your Kanchipuram silk sari
Fold at the borders yet?</i>

193
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,500
<i>He said that he will take me
To watch an English movie</i>

194
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:27,667
<i>And that he will teach me the French kiss</i>

195
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,250
<i>I am very happy! Oh, dear!</i>

196
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,250
<i>The night is full of ecstatic energy</i>

197
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,667
<i>Then, he drank a frothing beer
While dancing in his lungi</i>

198
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,292
And slumbered into deep sleep
After having sambar and idli

199
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,875
<i>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Don't jump around hither tither!</i>

200
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
<i>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Just come with me to the beach!</i>

201
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,542
<i>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
If I ruin your place…</i>

202
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,917
<i>I will get to know everything
With the pull of a string</i>

203
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,792
<i>Walking around through small gullies
I went weak in the knees</i>

204
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,125
<i>At the Charminar
He gulped down some drinks</i>

205
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,458
<i>So, you finally landed in Vizag!</i>

206
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:02,708
<i>This city is beautiful
Would you like to see around?</i>

207
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:06,333
<i>Boss' cutout is like that of a lighthouse</i>

208
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:09,417
<i>Let's go out and check out the city!</i>

209
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,833
<i>Baby, your body is soft</i>

210
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,958
<i>If you get down on the ground
You will pass out</i>

211
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:19,333
<i>Up and down
This train runs all around</i>

212
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:24,000
<i>If you like me and signal me
I will stay here with you</i>

213
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,625
<i>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Don't jump around hither tither!</i>

214
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,792
<i>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Just come with me to the beach!</i>

215
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,292
<i>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
If I ruin your place…</i>

216
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,625
<i>I will get to know everything
With the pull of a string</i>

217
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,458
That's it!
I am smoking a cigarette right now!

218
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,708
He made me go around
temples since morning.

219
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,833
Why did you throw away
half the cigarette?

220
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:22,958
-Smoking is injurious to health.
-So?

221
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:26,125
So, if I'm smoking just the half, its
side effect will also reduce that much.

222
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,375
Crazy!

223
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,833
Five minutes, baby.

224
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,542
Baby?

225
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,333
Why would you call him that?

226
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,083
He is a retired bank manager.

227
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:37,750
He has a lot of money.

228
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,458
He has no wife.

229
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,792
It seems like he's always
wanted a woman like me.

230
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,125
I've planned a trip to Shimla.

231
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,333
I will get all the details of
his credit card and debit card.

232
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:52,417
I am fine with whatever we get.
What do you think?

233
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,250
Why?

234
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,708
I am okay with your deal.

235
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,500
What?

236
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:58,833
Throw it away.

237
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,542
-Let's snap a selfie.
-Of course!

238
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,958
Oh, you figured it out.

239
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,750
Auntie Pavithra! You know the meaning
of your name is "sinless," right?

240
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,667
Did someone else name you
or you chose it for yourself?

241
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,167
-Shut your mouth!
-All right.

242
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,917
I can't hold it any longer, partner!

243
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,625
Partner, it's Rubi.

244
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:24,833
Did she see us?

245
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,708
Even if she saw us,
she won't enter the men's room.

246
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,625
-Oh, no! She's here.
-Aditya!

247
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:31,875
Hey…

248
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,250
what are you up to?

249
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,292
He is urinating.

250
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,292
I've been trying to reach you for a week.
Why are you ignoring my calls?

251
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,917
You don't even reply to my messages.

252
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,667
You don't respond to my WhatsApp
messages despite being online.

253
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,875
I should have worn diapers.

254
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,667
You don't even bother to message
me on Google Pay!

255
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,750
Messaging on Google Pay?
What is this, bro?

256
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,458
Nowadays, Google Pay is
also being used for messages!

257
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:51,917
I won't leave unless you tell
me the reason for avoiding me!

258
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,792
I can't relax myself
'til you're here, Rubi!

259
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,125
I am not leaving without
knowing the reason!

260
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,583
Why did you give me false hopes?

261
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,125
Did I ever say that I love you?

262
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,875
No.

263
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,875
Did I ever ask you to get married to me?

264
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,625
Did I ever decide the names of our kids?

265
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,667
Then, where did you get
all these hopes from?

266
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,917
What about our relationship?

267
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,708
Time to switch to Paytm!

268
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,583
Girls fall for you in a flash,
but you leave them immediately.

269
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,958
I don't get it, partner.

270
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,417
So? Are you planning
to make a biopic on me?

271
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,292
Siddhu.

272
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,958
I wanted to ask my
dad when I was a kid…

273
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,042
"Will you stay with us…

274
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,500
until the end and can I trust you?"

275
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,667
…but I never asked
him as he was my dad.

276
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:05,375
He left me and my mom.

277
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,125
"Anyway, he's gone.

278
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,750
At least, will you stay
with me until the end?

279
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,792
Can I trust you?"

280
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,917
I thought I should ask this to my mother…

281
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:24,667
but I did not ask her either.

282
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,875
She left me and got
married to someone else.

283
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,583
And after that,
nobody has crossed my path to date…

284
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,833
to whom I could ask this question.

285
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,958
Now, you've come into my life.

286
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,167
Will you stay with me until the end?

287
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,542
Can I trust you?

288
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,292
Those, who have parents, think that…

289
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,125
their wives are supposed to care of them.

290
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,917
Then, there are people like
me, who don't have parents.

291
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,958
They take care of their
wives as their parents.

292
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,458
If there's anyone I want
to spend my life with,

293
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,625
it is only you.

294
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:07,208
Did I get overly emotional?

295
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:11,500
When it comes to us,
anything less is a problem.

296
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,708
Anything in excess is just fine.

297
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,333
I love you.

298
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,833
There are total 160 apartments.

299
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:36,000
Sixty out of them are 3BHK apartments,
and the rest are 2BHK apartments.

300
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,958
So, you've started
looting people already.

301
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,125
There's sufficient corridor space
and ample ventilation.

302
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,042
Hey, be careful.

303
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,917
Here, we have all the facilities
we'd look for in our apartment.

304
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,250
We provide all those amenities with less
margin, and I have quoted the best price.

305
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,833
As you said earlier, a lot of
people around me are ready to loot.

306
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,458
People usually can't bear
someone else's success.

307
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,292
So, they have their dirty trails.

308
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,625
My father's savings and my savings…

309
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,750
have been invested in this project.

310
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,625
This project is going to decide my future.

311
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,000
-If this fails--
-Hey!

312
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,083
I am not the only one who
understands your genuineness.

313
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,375
Even your work that you do
with so much passion…

314
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:20,875
understands your genuineness.

315
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,292
Here.

316
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:26,208
If you put your heart into
something, it never fails.

317
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,333
I thought I'd fall in love
with a creative person…

318
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,875
like a painter, a writer or a musician.

319
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:37,833
But what can I do…

320
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,750
I got an engineer.

321
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:41,875
Why? What's wrong with me?

322
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,708
What is creative about you?

323
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:47,042
You just draw the same thing differently
each time. Am I not right?

324
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,042
You took this picture
near Howrah Bridge, right?

325
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,042
Yes…

326
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,250
so what?

327
00:23:58,417 --> 00:23:59,333
Strapless.

328
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:02,167
-You wear it very easily…
-Siddhu, give it to me!

329
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,375
-but there is an engineer behind this.
-Give it to me!

330
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,208
-Cantilever Principle.
-Siddhu, give it to me!

331
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:08,583
The same principle used
for the Howrah Bridge

332
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,958
-has been used for this strapless bra.
-Give it to me, Siddhu!

333
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:13,375
Without any support, it can hold the fort.

334
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:15,500
-Give it back, Siddharth!
-Is it not creativity?

335
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,583
There is an engineer even
behind a woman's undergarment!

336
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,292
That is my friend's.

337
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:22,792
Really?

338
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:24,917
But it's the same principle.

339
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,167
-Okay!
-Stupid.

340
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:37,750
What's with you?

341
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,042
I am going…

342
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:41,000
to jail.

343
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,875
Vema Imports and Exports.

344
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,375
That shop is mine.

345
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,792
Look at that, partner. It got sealed.

346
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,208
It got sealed because I
sold 30 duplicate computers…

347
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,792
as the imported and the original ones.

348
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,958
So, now,
I am going to be exported to jail.

349
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,000
Do I deserve going to jail?

350
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:06,500
Bloody burgers!

351
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
When did this happen?

352
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,917
We were not partners back then.

353
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,917
This case has been going on
for the last three years.

354
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,625
Tomorrow is the final verdict.

355
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:18,333
There are ten more people
involved in this case…

356
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:22,000
but all of them have a lot of money
and the support of influential higher-ups!

357
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:23,750
So, they escaped this situation!

358
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:26,250
I am the only one who's stuck!

359
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:27,792
Do you have the charge sheet?

360
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,417
I did not get a charger, partner.
Why? Is your battery dying?

361
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,625
-Hey!
-What?

362
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,833
I'm talking about a paper that has
the details of the case filed against you.

363
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:35,333
-Oh, okay.
-Where is it?

364
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,750
No matter how long you look at that
paper, there is no use.

365
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:42,750
It is not easy to fool them like
we fooled the other people, partner.

366
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,917
We're dealing with
the law and the court here.

367
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,875
The Tamil lawyer has
finalized the matter.

368
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,708
I am going to jail, for sure.

369
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:52,625
I understood now how
it must have happened.

370
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:55,375
When Jayasudha said, "I will hit you"

371
00:25:56,167 --> 00:26:01,708
to Prakash Raj in the climax
of the movie Bommarillu,

372
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:04,250
everyone in the theater
watched it very seriously…

373
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:05,458
but I just…

374
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,542
giggled, partner.

375
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:12,167
I think, Miss Jayasudha cursed me…

376
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:16,125
last night, in the Vema's house.

377
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:21,958
Partner, please take me along
with you when you'll go back.

378
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,500
I am going to jail.

379
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:38,542
Greetings, sir.

380
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,292
Better late than never. Anyway, let's go.

381
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,042
Did you study the case properly?

382
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,833
No, I did not.

383
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,167
If you've studied the case,

384
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,875
-you may come in and talk.
-Let it be, partner.

385
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:50,625
Sir, my friend has no
sense of how to talk.

386
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:53,167
Yeah, I can see that. Come.

387
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,292
Ask them to discharge you, they'll do it.

388
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:59,042
It's not a hospital, it's the court.
I can't ask them to discharge me.

389
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,458
He is a public prosecutor.

390
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:04,125
I see. He is using some legal words.

391
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,625
You want me to discharge him!

392
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,000
There were total 30 computers,
and all of them were duplicate.

393
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,250
The boxes had Dell's logo on them,

394
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,958
but the computers
inside were just hollow.

395
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:17,000
He was caught red-handed by the police.

396
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:20,333
Discharge him, my foot!

397
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,375
Check the charge sheet.

398
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,125
Hey, who are you?

399
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,458
Everything's clearly mentioned
in it about those 30 computers!

400
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,750
Hey, stop! What is it?

401
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,000
It is written here that
30 boxes were recovered,

402
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,958
but they forgot to mention
about the computers.

403
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,625
Clerical mistake!

404
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:53,042
I am sure… this is more than enough
to go and talk inside. Now, leave.

405
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,667
Let's move.

406
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:00,208
Excuse me, sir!

407
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:02,917
It's a very small issue,

408
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:06,458
and we don't have to be
geniuses to figure it out.

409
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:09,875
We just have to use our
brains a little. Got it?

410
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:12,458
You can go now.

411
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,625
Due to the lack of proper evidence,
this case has been dismissed.

412
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:26,750
On this happy occasion of my case
dismissal, let's get drunk today, partner.

413
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:28,542
By the way, what have you studied?

414
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,917
-Inter.
-Winter?

415
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,500
How is it connected to what
you spoke to my lawyer about?

416
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:34,542
And…

417
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,625
sorry, just a minute.

418
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:38,125
Hello!

419
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:40,375
I was about to call you, boss,
but you called me before that.

420
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,375
<i>I am sure you remember.</i>

421
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,458
I can forget my birthday, but I can
never forget the date I give you.

422
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,292
I will give you the money tomorrow.

423
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,000
Okay, boss. Bye.

424
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,792
I will go and get some drinks
for us, partner.

425
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,083
<i>What's with all the fuss
about these brands!</i>

426
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:07,792
<i>Oh, no! Such a big queue!</i>

427
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,917
Hey, Vema! What are you doing here?

428
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:16,625
I should ask you this question.

429
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:18,833
Didn't you go to jail?

430
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,792
You're asking me as if
it's a vacation spot.

431
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,000
Why don't you tell me? Come.

432
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,625
-Hey, go back.
-I am with her.

433
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:25,375
Adi pointed out some flaw

434
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:27,792
in the charge sheet. Even the lawyer
didn't know about it.

435
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,083
And he says he's only
studied until winter.

436
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:31,833
He can speak four to five
languages easily.

437
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,125
I don't understand him at all.

438
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,958
I know him better than you do.

439
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:39,792
With that kind of intelligence,
he can easily sell half the city.

440
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,458
What can we do?

441
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:44,667
But yes, just like everyone,
he also has one weakness…

442
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:45,833
gambling.

443
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,542
He cannot control
himself if he sees money.

444
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,583
When he is gambling with the cards,
he loses track of the time.

445
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,333
Hey!

446
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,833
Yesterday, when I called him,
he said that the money is ready.

447
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:38,583
Now, he says that he has no money.

448
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:41,292
What happened to the money, Vema?

449
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45,583
He is telling you the truth.

450
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,208
I took his money without his knowledge.

451
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:48,125
And?

452
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,792
I used it for gambling…

453
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:54,667
and I lost it.

454
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,333
Eight lakhs?

455
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,208
You're saying you lost
it all in one night!

456
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,458
You may not have the fear
of losing that money,

457
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,125
but…

458
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:11,208
I am sure Vema has that fear.

459
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:14,792
He fears that he will be killed
if he does not repay the money.

460
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,083
Am I right, Vema?

461
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,250
Yes, boss.

462
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,833
I'm giving you one week.

463
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,625
You owe me a total of eight plus
one, nine lakhs.

464
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,583
I not only eat fish that
I get from the sea…

465
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:38,792
but also kill people and throw them
in the sea if they do something wrong.

466
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:48,708
I would have been safe if I were in jail.

467
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,583
Now, you've left me to die at his hands!

468
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:52,833
That idiot says that he'll kill
me and throw me in the sea.

469
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,125
What kind of a person are you!

470
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:55,583
Are you going to die if you don't gamble?

471
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,542
Don't worry, it is just money.
We will give it back.

472
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,792
Call the machine maker,
and ask him to make an ATM.

473
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:02,042
How would we earn nine lakhs in one
week, and how many ATMs--

474
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,042
Hey!

475
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:04,917
Do you have any other option?

476
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:25,792
Hello… Auntie?

477
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:46,542
Did he start the work?

478
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,083
He said he'll start the work
only if we give him a lakh rupees.

479
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:49,708
But we'd agreed to give him
the money after the work is done.

480
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:52,500
-Didn't you tell him?
-I did, but he is not ready to listen.

481
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:54,667
What the hell!

482
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,042
-He earned so much money because of us--
-Calm down.

483
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,542
Getting angry won't help. Trust me.

484
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:01,333
We cannot get anything
done without a lakh rupees.

485
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:08,750
Aditya?

486
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:18,125
I didn't expect to see you
here like this, at all.

487
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,792
Mother-in-law had told me
that you'd be coming tomorrow.

488
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,542
-Mother-in-law?
-Sorry. I call your mother that.

489
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,333
You said your mother's no more.

490
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:35,042
It was scary to read in the newspapers
about the heavy rains in Kolkata

491
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,417
from the past three days.

492
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,083
As it is, you are a pilot.

493
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:45,083
I pray every day in
the temple for your safety.

494
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,458
I am learning Bengali, as well.

495
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:51,792
I don't want it to become
a problem after our marriage.

496
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:54,542
-You're mistaking me for someone else--
-Oh, I forgot to tell you.

497
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,375
Mother-in-law had asked me to give
her some money for her treatment.

498
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,458
She had asked for one
and a half lakh rupees…

499
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,625
but I only have a lakh in my account.

500
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,583
So, I had come to the bank
to withdraw the money.

501
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:09,333
Mother-in-law's calling.

502
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:10,708
Hello?

503
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:11,833
Mother-in-law!

504
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:14,292
This is a great opportunity
Please, take the money.

505
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:15,333
At the corner?

506
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:16,542
I am coming.

507
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,625
She is waiting in an auto-rickshaw.

508
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,458
Go ahead, I'm coming.

509
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,625
Okay.

510
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:24,250
What about the money?

511
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:29,792
It's just been ten minutes.

512
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,458
I saw him outside the bank.

513
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:33,958
I didn't expect to see him at all.

514
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:35,833
I'm sure your mother-in-law
didn't expect this as well.

515
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,667
Auntie is surprised to see us.

516
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,083
Don't you think so?

517
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,917
Here's the money that you had asked for.

518
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,000
It's okay.

519
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,250
I am here,
I will take care of my mother.

520
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:47,625
-You may leave.
-Okay.

521
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:49,208
I'll get going, Mother.

522
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,417
-Bye.
-Bye.

523
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:55,083
How can you act like a mother?
I tried to flirt with you so many times.

524
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,292
-Hey!
-What--

525
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,292
Who's that girl?

526
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:59,917
I told you not to drag me
into your nonsense!

527
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:01,625
I did not plan it.
It just happened.

528
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:04,083
We were just sharing
an auto-rickshaw together.

529
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,875
She said that she works
at a cell phone store…

530
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:09,000
her father works as a security guard

531
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,958
and her family
wants her to get married.

532
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:14,333
I said that I am doing the same thing.
And I showed her your picture.

533
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:18,542
I told her that my son is a pilot.
And that he lives in Kolkata.

534
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,042
I just lied and she believed it all.
What can I do?

535
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,042
Did you have to use my photo?

536
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:24,917
Had I showed his picture, she'd have
jumped out of the auto-rickshaw.

537
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,583
-Hey, what's wrong with me?
-Hello?

538
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:30,458
My father had called me. I told
him that I met you and your mother.

539
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,292
Did you give her my number?

540
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,250
You change your number
every two months, so…

541
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:35,792
didn't you change your number?

542
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,000
Hello?

543
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:40,500
What's the update on
Mother-in-law's treatment?

544
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,167
Yes, her treatment has begun.

545
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,375
She'll be perfectly fine.

546
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:46,375
When can my father and I come to see her?

547
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:48,250
I will tell you.

548
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,792
Actually, I liked you the moment
I saw your photo.

549
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:57,167
I never expected to get such
a good alliance for my marriage.

550
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,167
My family is very happy about this.

551
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,042
I…

552
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,000
hello?

553
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:04,250
Hello!

554
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:06,917
The call got disconnected.

555
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,875
I will not spare you…

556
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:15,417
if she gets in my way ever again!

557
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:22,167
One lakh rupees… gone.

558
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:24,792
Come.

559
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:48,292
We have a week before
I get killed by Baabji.

560
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,333
Please get a policy done on
my name before that, partner.

561
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:53,708
Then, you can happily play
cards with the money you'll get

562
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,042
from the policy after my death.

563
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,292
-Don't overreact.
-Who is overacting here?

564
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,750
Had we taken one lakh rupees from her,
we would've managed somehow!

565
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,250
Why didn't you take that money?

566
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,625
Hey, she works at a mobile shop.

567
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,250
She must be thinking twice

568
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,167
even before buying anything she likes,
because of how less she earns.

569
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,250
Poor girl. Leave it.

570
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,292
Poor girl?

571
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,500
What about me?
Don't you care about my life, partner?

572
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,083
Sorry… pilot.

573
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,833
Kolkata, heavy rains.
Drive carefully, okay?

574
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:23,833
We will do something.
Stop nagging me.

575
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,042
Enough now!

576
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:30,333
That Baabji is going to kill me anyway.

577
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,375
I'd rather kill myself.

578
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:38,917
Don't you feel like stopping me?

579
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:40,708
I know you will not jump.

580
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:43,292
Oh! You know everything!

581
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:46,125
I am the only one who knows nothing.

582
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,875
Hey!

583
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,083
-No!
-Hey, Vema!

584
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,958
Hey, give me the bike keys.

585
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:54,000
Pilots don't ride bikes.

586
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:07,542
I'll be back after five days.

587
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,333
Yeah, you told me about
the trip with your friends.

588
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,167
There are five of us.

589
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:15,542
Three girls… and two boys.

590
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:20,417
What?

591
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:26,917
One of the boys is smart and handsome.
Many girls have a crush on him…

592
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:30,458
but he likes me.

593
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,583
He is all prepared…

594
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,917
to propose to me on this trip.

595
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,375
This is what my friend told me.

596
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh, really?

597
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:52,167
What should I say to him
if he proposed to me?

598
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,250
Tell him, "My boyfriend kissed
me, and my lips are still wet."

599
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:13,708
<i>You and only you</i>

600
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:18,125
<i>Are enough for me to live</i>

601
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:22,167
<i>Then, you have no other wish</i>

602
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:27,250
<i>That needs to be fulfilled</i>

603
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:31,125
<i>You are like the rain</i>

604
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:35,208
<i>That deserts crave</i>

605
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,250
<i>You are like the gift</i>

606
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:45,167
<i>That shows itself</i>

607
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,000
<i>Yeah!</i>

608
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:34,375
<i>Your touch has spoken about the void</i>

609
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:38,792
<i>And I am full only with you</i>

610
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:43,042
<i>I swear I didn't know
How I lived all through</i>

611
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,292
<i>If not for you
I wouldn't realize my true self</i>

612
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:51,542
<i>The love that makes us feel like</i>

613
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:55,917
<i>We are the first couple of this world
Isn't it crazy?</i>

614
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,167
<i>Without madness
Wouldn't love cease to exist?</i>

615
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:04,583
<i>Is it wrong to spread the love?
Isn't love the only truth?</i>

616
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:25,625
<i>You and only you</i>

617
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,000
<i>Are enough for me to live</i>

618
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,250
<i>Then, you have no other wish</i>

619
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:39,042
<i>That needs to be fulfilled</i>

620
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:42,958
<i>You are like the rain</i>

621
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,292
<i>That deserts crave</i>

622
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,375
<i>You are like the gift</i>

623
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:57,167
<i>That shows itself</i>

624
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:11,625
<i>I just need one reason to live</i>

625
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:15,958
<i>And that reason is you</i>

626
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:20,250
<i>Don't say this to anyone
For, this is our secret to keep</i>

627
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:24,500
<i>Make your nest in my heart</i>

628
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:28,792
<i>For the words that seek their way</i>

629
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:33,167
<i>Aren't you the answer</i>

630
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,458
<i>To whom should I submit myself to?</i>

631
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:41,917
<i>Aren't you an answer to all my questions?</i>

632
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,917
For the first time in my life,
I've done something good.

633
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:07,292
What did you do?

634
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,667
I've resigned from my job.

635
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:11,250
-What?
-Yes, I've resigned from my job.

636
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,333
Why?

637
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:14,167
That is what I also thought, "why?"

638
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:17,042
Siddharth and I are getting married.

639
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:18,458
When?

640
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,500
After I return from Keertan's wedding.

641
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,458
Have you really thought about it?

642
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,292
Nope. Not at all.

643
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,083
Mahima!

644
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:30,000
I swear.

645
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:34,333
Look, I just know that I should not
keep him away from me any longer.

646
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:36,750
Nothing else is on my mind.

647
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:41,875
He's given me all that I've
missed in the past eight years.

648
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,250
What more can I ask for?

649
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,583
A 15-day wedding?

650
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:52,333
Is your friend crazy?

651
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,375
Siddhu, she is my best friend,
and I cannot avoid it.

652
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:58,292
Reunion, Meghalaya trip…

653
00:45:58,917 --> 00:46:01,583
bachelorette party, music ceremony,
henna ceremony, and so on.

654
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,625
So, all of that would take 15 days.
She's got me all packed.

655
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:08,667
I have also planned our wedding.

656
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:11,042
-When?
-Just now.

657
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:13,083
-How many days?
-Just 15 minutes.

658
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:17,792
I don't have the patience for all that.

659
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:19,833
After you return from
your friend's wedding,

660
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:23,000
I'll marry you at the first religious
place I'll spot. It doesn't matter…

661
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,125
if it's a church, a temple or a mosque.

662
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:28,167
Everyone is going to talk
about her marriage…

663
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:32,625
but we will talk to everyone
about our marriage.

664
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,750
Sounds alright.

665
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:38,458
Sounds crazy.

666
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,667
Siddhu!

667
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,083
Meanwhile,
what if someone else proposes to me?

668
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
You know what to say.

669
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,083
VISAKHAPATNAM

670
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:23,250
Please stop for a minute.

671
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:32,125
I had made a perfect plan saying…

672
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:36,042
that my son is a pilot,
but it was of no use.

673
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,167
-Tell me, Vema.
-It's Baabji.

674
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:51,208
There is still one more day.

675
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,875
What can you do in a day if you
could not do anything in six days?

676
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:55,917
I shouldn't have given
you even this much time.

677
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:58,708
Give me my money tomorrow
by 11:00 a.m. and take your guy.

678
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:01,875
I killed my father because I
had some minor issue with him.

679
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,792
So, killing you won't
be a big deal for me.

680
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:04,875
Let me talk to Vema once.

681
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:10,625
-Hello.
-Hey, Vema.

682
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:16,042
Don't worry. No matter what, I will be
there with the money by tomorrow morning.

683
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:18,458
Vema!

684
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:19,958
Hey!

685
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:33,375
Friends, all the apartments
of Siddharth Homes…

686
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,750
have sold out even before
the completion of its construction.

687
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,458
-Cheers, guys!
-Cheers!

688
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:38,542
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

689
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,917
Hey, I need some money urgently.

690
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:43,167
I bought a piece of land
just a week ago, Aditya.

691
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,583
Sorry, it's not possible
without security.

692
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:46,792
That Baabji is a very
dangerous fellow, Aditya.

693
00:48:47,042 --> 00:48:49,375
<i>He does what he says. Take care of Vema.</i>

694
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:07,750
<i>I am learning Bengali, as well.</i>

695
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:11,167
<i>I don't want it to become a problem
after our marriage.</i>

696
00:49:12,292 --> 00:49:14,500
Hey, why do you seem so upset?

697
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,458
Tell me, dear.

698
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,333
Gayathri?

699
00:49:28,917 --> 00:49:31,042
Sister, Aditya…

700
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:35,208
-it was all a lie.
-What do you mean?

701
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:37,417
That woman lied to me for some money.

702
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:39,208
What are you talking about?

703
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,917
I would've never imagined something
like this even in my wildest dreams!

704
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,208
Nothing good can happen in my life.
I should've known.

705
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:49,292
Why can't the truth be as
beautiful as the lie, sister?

706
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:52,125
Shall we complain to the police?

707
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:53,625
No, sister.

708
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,583
She might be a cunning woman…

709
00:49:58,083 --> 00:49:59,667
but Aditya is not like that.

710
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:05,458
Had he been greedy, he would have
taken the money from me immediately.

711
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,875
He didn't do that, so that
means, he's a good guy. Right?

712
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:30,083
Mom's health has worsened,
and the doctor's advised a surgery.

713
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:34,833
All my money is in an FD.

714
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,750
It is difficult to get
that out immediately.

715
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:42,000
If you could give me one lakh
rupees right now, I'd be grateful.

716
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,292
Thanks.

717
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:17,792
I will return it to you in two days.
Should I talk to your father?

718
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:20,375
He is not here. It's his night shift.

719
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:24,708
I don't need to ask anyone.

720
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,500
This is my money.

721
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:34,083
I had to compromise a lot in
order to save the money…

722
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:38,917
but this money gave me
hopes for my wedding.

723
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:41,500
This is mine.

724
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:45,833
I am not answerable to anyone.

725
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:49,417
I'll leave now.

726
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:53,917
Aditya!

727
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:00,750
Do you even know what my name is?

728
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:45,208
Thank you. Hey, I'll get going now.

729
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:46,500
This is your party, man!

730
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:48,667
I have a land registration in the morning.
I can't be late.

731
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,833
You will take care of everything, right?

732
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,833
-Yeah. Bye-bye. Take care.
-Okay, bye.

733
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,958
Sir, the new sub-inspector is talking
about all the rules.

734
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:36,500
She was suspended for three
months for helping an accused.

735
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:38,708
After that,
she got transferred to this station.

736
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:45,000
What are you guys doing?
Get out, everyone!

737
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,917
Don't you know that you should
not contaminate a crime scene?

738
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,958
Sorry, ma'am.

739
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:51,375
You guys are simply
having a chitchat! Out!

740
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:52,833
-Come, let's go.
-Sir!

741
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:54,333
Sir!

742
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:06,500
-Who informed us?
-The servant, sir.

743
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,083
She came back this
morning from her village.

744
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:11,250
After the murder, the body was dumped
into the tub with the tap open.

745
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:13,500
The servant turned off
the tap after she got here.

746
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:14,917
Any evidence?

747
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:16,167
No, sir.

748
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:17,833
We couldn't even find a small clue.

749
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:21,708
So, do you think that the murderer
has forensic knowledge?

750
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:43,583
I am sure he did not use any
knife to execute the murder.

751
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,417
It's a very sharp object.

752
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,167
Point of entry, sir.

753
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,292
This is the spot of the murder, sir.

754
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:21,708
Sir, the victim's name is Akash.

755
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:24,125
He doesn't have a mother,
and his father stays in the US.

756
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:27,542
Karma.

757
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:31,125
Our hands are already full of existing
cases, and now, we have one more.

758
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,083
Hey, 201!

759
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:34,667
Hey, Sudhakar!

760
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:36,417
Go.

761
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,708
Why don't you use a hearing aid
if you can't hear properly?

762
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:40,792
Nothing like that, sir. I can hear well.

763
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:45,083
-We are discussing the case, sir.
-Enough! Go, get a pack of cigarette!

764
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:46,250
Okay, sir.

765
00:59:49,042 --> 00:59:50,000
-Yamini.
-Sir!

766
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:51,333
Please, handle this case.

767
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:55,042
Also, inform his father.

768
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:57,875
Find out if he has any
relatives in the city.

769
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,208
Yeah, he is my cousin.

770
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:06,500
Please check if any money or
jewelry has gone missing.

771
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:14,583
The locker always used
to have a lot of cash.

772
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:17,292
That is missing now,
so I am sure something has happened.

773
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,375
-Where did you get this money from?
-What does it matter to you?

774
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:31,500
All you need is money.

775
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:34,875
It is not easy to earn nine
lakhs in one night, right?

776
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:38,333
I am just curious to know what
you did to get all this money.

777
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,250
Hey!

778
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:05,083
Why did you give me the money
if you knew I was lying?

779
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,625
I knew you were lying…

780
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,167
but I realized your necessity.

781
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,500
What if I had not returned?

782
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:19,000
What if I had stolen your money?

783
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:24,417
Had you not returned, it would have
been easy for me to forget about you…

784
01:01:25,917 --> 01:01:28,500
but it'd have been difficult
for you to forget about me.

785
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:37,833
What is all this?

786
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:40,917
I am not sure, Aditya.

787
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:43,125
This is new for me, as well.

788
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:52,708
I am done.

789
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:56,708
Will you stay back?

790
01:02:25,917 --> 01:02:28,375
The Circle Inspector is not at
all interested in this case.

791
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,375
He's given me this case as a formality.

792
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:33,000
We have been continuously
looking for witnesses…

793
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:34,792
and some evidence, but all in vain.

794
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:36,250
What more can we do, ma'am?

795
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:38,583
Ma'am…

796
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,792
the watchman who lives
next door had left for his village…

797
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:42,292
citing a marriage, just two
days before the incident.

798
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:43,500
His house is also locked.

799
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:46,333
-What about the others?
-I have inquired about everyone, ma'am.

800
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:50,000
No one stays here permanently except
for people visiting in summers or for fun.

801
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:52,875
In these types of houses,
even the people living in the same house

802
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:55,125
wouldn't know if a murder has
taken place in their house.

803
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:57,542
Then, how the people living next door
or in the opposite house would know?

804
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,208
-I am telling--
-What are you discussing? Get in the car.

805
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,708
-Sir!
-What is it?

806
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:19,750
We have been inquiring
about Akash's murder case.

807
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:21,792
On the night of the murder,

808
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:24,125
a birthday party was happening in
the house right across the Akash's house.

809
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:25,750
-So what?
-The party was thrown…

810
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,000
by the house owner's son.

811
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,958
He's from Vijayawada.
I've called him to the station.

812
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,708
-I hope I don't get into any trouble.
-Don't worry.

813
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,167
We got you here because we had some
doubts. Just wait for some time.

814
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,583
Come to the point, Yamini.

815
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:39,375
Sir.

816
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:43,208
-This is a selfie with his girlfriend.
-So?

817
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:46,958
Please zoom in, and look at
the right corner of the picture.

818
01:03:47,042 --> 01:03:49,000
It is the exact time
frame of Akash's murder…

819
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:52,042
and he is standing in
the balcony of Akash's house.

820
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:00,875
I know this person.

821
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:02,792
His name is Siddharth.

822
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,458
Former IIT student.

823
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:09,750
Send this picture across
all the police stations.

824
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:12,083
-Sir.
-Also, find out his present address.

825
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,417
Put aside all the other cases…

826
01:04:15,542 --> 01:04:17,250
and focus only on this
person and this case.

827
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,167
-Sir.
-Okay?

828
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,167
-Yes, sir.
-Sir.

829
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:27,208
I've finally got you after a long time!

830
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:38,958
Siddharth?

831
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,125
Yes.

832
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,833
Hello!

833
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:01,083
Can you hear me?

834
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:04,625
What's happening here?

835
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:16,917
Hello!

836
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:18,750
Anyone there?

837
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:17,750
What are you doing, sir?

838
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,083
You'd told me this inquiry will
not last more than ten minutes,

839
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:21,792
but you've locked me in since 10:00 a.m.

840
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:24,125
No one here seems to bother
about what I have to say.

841
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:25,583
You took my phone, as well.

842
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:26,667
Give me back my phone.

843
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,500
What problem did you have with Akash?

844
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:30,792
Akash?

845
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:33,042
-Who is Akash?
-R. Akash.

846
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:35,875
Number 31.

847
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:37,667
Sea Breeze Villa.

848
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:39,833
I don't know.

849
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,667
Where were you on Sunday night?

850
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:46,708
I was at a party with my colleagues.

851
01:06:46,792 --> 01:06:49,417
I heard that you left the party halfway.

852
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:53,875
What was so urgent?

853
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:57,958
I have a land registration in the morning.
I can't be late.

854
01:06:58,667 --> 01:06:59,625
Nothing was urgent.

855
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:01,833
-I had a slight headache.
-Headache?

856
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:06,833
But it seems that you told your friend
there was some registration the day after.

857
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:11,375
However, on Monday,
you did not go for any registration.

858
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,500
We have inquired about all the details.

859
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,542
Don't play the fool with us.

860
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:20,167
Sir, you're keeping our
bitter past in mind.

861
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,292
That's why,
you're trying to trap me on purpose.

862
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:27,708
How dare you say that!

863
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:48,292
You left the party at 11:30 p.m.
From there…

864
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,458
it is a 20 minutes' drive to your home.

865
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,833
Then, what the hell were
you doing until 3:30 a.m.?

866
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:58,792
I had a flat tire on the way.

867
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,208
Where?

868
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,708
The CMR Subway.

869
01:08:13,417 --> 01:08:17,167
Bhupati, does it take three
hours to change a flat tire?

870
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,708
It takes maximum half an hour.

871
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:22,708
There was no jack in my car.

872
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,833
I kept asking for help from all the people
going that way, but nobody cared to stop.

873
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:31,000
Then finally, one guy stopped his car, but
he had no jack either. So, he also left.

874
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:35,708
After a long time, a cab guy helped me.

875
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:44,583
Which cab?

876
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,083
I did not notice it.

877
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:47,042
Cab number?

878
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:49,292
It was raining,
so I could not see it properly.

879
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,583
You neither know the type
of cab nor the cab number,

880
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:53,167
but someone helped you and left.

881
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:55,083
His story is very interesting, sir.

882
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:02,000
Believe it or not, but that's the truth.

883
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:06,333
Exactly that day, a person named
"Akash" was brutally murdered…

884
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:09,000
with a sharp weapon.

885
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:12,708
Here! He was mercilessly
stabbed and killed.

886
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:14,667
But why are you telling me all this?

887
01:09:18,042 --> 01:09:19,000
Right.

888
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:20,750
Why I'm telling you!

889
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:24,250
It's because you don't know who Akash is.

890
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:26,708
You have no connection with Akash,

891
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,125
and you did not go
to his house that night.

892
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:35,917
But then, what the hell were you
doing in his balcony…

893
01:09:36,792 --> 01:09:39,292
exactly at the time of the murder?

894
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:02,958
This single evidence is more than enough.

895
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,375
Your life and career are finished.

896
01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:07,917
You're dead.

897
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:24,625
I have absolutely no
connection with this case!

898
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:28,125
The Circle Inspector is
purposefully targeting me!

899
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:30,208
He just wants revenge against me!

900
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,542
Give me back my phone!

901
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,292
I have the right to speak to my lawyer!

902
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:45,083
Sir, there's a small problem.

903
01:10:45,667 --> 01:10:47,375
-What?
-Please come with me, sir.

904
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,250
Hey!

905
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,958
Hey!

906
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,792
Sir, he is drunk.

907
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:28,458
We arrested him for drunk driving.

908
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:30,833
We had sent his photo
to all our stations.

909
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,542
The sub-inspector
at Madhurawada Station

910
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:34,083
identified him
and sent him here.

911
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,792
-Take him to the storeroom.
-Yes, sir.

912
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:24,875
Where were you on the second night?

913
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:32,750
I hardly remember what happens two
minutes ago. How do you expect me to--

914
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:33,833
Shut up!

915
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,042
Damn it! I'm back to my senses.

916
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:41,333
Answer his question!

917
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:43,583
Give me some time to remember, sir.

918
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:50,833
That day, my friend was not well.

919
01:12:51,792 --> 01:12:53,750
He had a high fever, so I was with him.

920
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,625
I went to my room after he took
his medicines and had dinner.

921
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:59,042
What is your friend's name?

922
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:01,000
Vema.

923
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:04,500
He has an import and export
shop on the Bazaar Street.

924
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,708
Find out the address
and the other details of this friend.

925
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:12,750
Okay, sir.

926
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,333
Hey, Sarathy. Come to the station.

927
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:24,042
-Now?
-Yes, now.

928
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,333
Tell me.

929
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,292
It's 36…

930
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:31,708
24…

931
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:33,875
36.

932
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:35,125
Hey!

933
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:40,583
Door no. 36, street no. 24, Vizag-36.

934
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:43,375
Address.

935
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:46,250
Isn't that what you asked me?

936
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:49,125
Sir, did you see that? He has a woman's
handkerchief in his hand.

937
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:53,083
Hey, is that it or do you have
nail polishes and lipsticks as well?

938
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,125
Hey!

939
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:55,792
Sorry.

940
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:07,042
Ma'am, is this your handkerchief?

941
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:07,958
You--

942
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:11,875
Gaurishankar Sharma versus the State
of Uttar Pradesh, January 12th, 1990!

943
01:14:12,167 --> 01:14:13,083
Gaurishankar?

944
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:15,042
He is talking about some judgment, Pydi.

945
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:16,208
What are you talking about?

946
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:18,417
"Any form of torture, cruel,
inhuman, or degrading

947
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,625
treatment is prohibited
by the court of law."

948
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:22,042
What is he saying?

949
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,125
You didn't hear it
or didn't understand it?

950
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:25,833
I heard it, but I didn't understand it.

951
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:29,125
It is against the law to torture
a suspect brought in for a mere inquiry.

952
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:30,833
Not just inflicting physical pain,

953
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,667
but any inhuman behavior…

954
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:34,458
is also a crime.

955
01:14:35,042 --> 01:14:36,708
IPC Section 330.

956
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,125
Are you not aware?

957
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:40,875
He's only aware of leaving the office
by 5:30 p.m. and going home.

958
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,708
Pritpal Singh versus the State of Punjab.

959
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:55,333
Just like this,

960
01:14:55,667 --> 01:14:58,250
a sub-inspector unaware of
the consequences of physically hurting

961
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:02,625
a suspect was suspended by the court,
along with all the other policemen…

962
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,083
who were just watching it quietly.

963
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,167
No one was spared.

964
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,458
Beat him in such a way
that it can't be made out.

965
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,500
Rigorous imprisonment.

966
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:26,792
Rigorous imprisonment.

967
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:32,625
Ragbir Singh versus the State of Haryana.

968
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:35,750
Don't you know?

969
01:15:36,667 --> 01:15:38,625
The head constable, who ordered
the other constable to hit a suspect

970
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:41,958
and the other constable, both were given
eight years of imprisonment by the court.

971
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:45,750
To date, both the constables…

972
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,083
are in the same jail as the accused.

973
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:53,042
Same jail.

974
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,500
Sudha…

975
01:15:58,208 --> 01:15:59,208
here!

976
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:00,333
Why?

977
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:03,542
I don't want my name to be on the list…

978
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:06,125
of Sudhakar Pasupula versus
the State of Andhra Pradesh case.

979
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,167
Sorry!

980
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:11,375
-Let's go.
-Yes.

981
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:31,125
What is this?

982
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:34,167
Both of them look strikingly same.

983
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:36,333
This is the only evidence we have.

984
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:39,958
If they want, get this picture
framed and give it to them.

985
01:16:40,792 --> 01:16:43,583
It's worthless. Trust me.

986
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,042
Did you file any case against Siddharth?

987
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:47,917
No.

988
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:50,042
I just got him here for an inquiry.

989
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:52,417
He is the managing director
of a construction company.

990
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:55,208
I am sure he has a lot of contacts.

991
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:59,625
It is not safe to keep
him in custody for long.

992
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:02,125
So, am I supposed to let him go just
like that? Should I give him a ride home?

993
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:03,667
-I didn't mean--
-Sarathy!

994
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,750
I called you here to help me.

995
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,583
I am going to retire in two months.

996
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:17,250
I will not get a better
opportunity than this to ruin him.

997
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:18,292
Nagendra…

998
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:22,333
I haven't forgot what happened
between you and Siddharth.

999
01:17:23,458 --> 01:17:24,750
But as a public prosecutor,

1000
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:27,875
I know the practical
problems involved in this.

1001
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:32,500
The real problem is that you've found
a person who looks exactly like Siddharth.

1002
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:36,458
Had you found this look-alike first…

1003
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:38,417
you could have killed him,

1004
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:40,875
and trapped Siddharth
in Akash's murder case.

1005
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:42,708
That would have closed the case.

1006
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:46,708
But this look-alike was
found by another police officer.

1007
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:50,625
Every detail has been recorded
from the time of his arrest

1008
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,917
to the time he got handed
over to you in this station.

1009
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,125
What do you want me to do now?

1010
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:56,417
That murder was committed
by either one of the two.

1011
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,125
-No doubt.
-So, one of them is undeniably lying.

1012
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:08,250
Today is Friday.

1013
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:10,875
The court will be closed
on Saturday and Sunday.

1014
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:14,083
Both of them have to be presented
before the court on Monday morning.

1015
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:17,542
You have only two days.

1016
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:20,250
Meanwhile, find out who the murderer is.

1017
01:18:20,792 --> 01:18:22,917
Find out if it's Siddharth or Aditya.

1018
01:18:23,708 --> 01:18:24,667
Find out!

1019
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:34,875
-Yes?
-Good morning, sir.

1020
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:37,667
-We are the students of a film institute.
-Okay.

1021
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:41,542
We have planned to make a documentary
based on Akash's murder case, sir.

1022
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,417
Sir, if you don't mind,
we need some information.

1023
01:18:48,417 --> 01:18:49,250
Sorry.

1024
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:50,500
-Sir!
-Please, sir.

1025
01:18:56,542 --> 01:18:57,542
Thank you so much, sir.

1026
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,375
I hope no one will know that
I've given you the information.

1027
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:00,417
Don't worry, sir.

1028
01:19:00,542 --> 01:19:01,917
-We will take care of it.
-Okay.

1029
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,458
This is for you to hear…

1030
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:06,833
and this is for me to hear.

1031
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:10,875
Though there have been many cases
in the past, this case is very unique.

1032
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,833
The Circle Inspector
and the Sub-Inspector…

1033
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,125
didn't let us breathe even for a minute.

1034
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,958
It feels like it just happened yesterday.

1035
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:18,792
I can still feel it.

1036
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:24,833
We have to produce both of
them in the court on Monday.

1037
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:27,667
We just have 48 hours.

1038
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:30,583
Within this time, we have to find
out who Akash's murderer is.

1039
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:33,708
Neither of them should
know about each other.

1040
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:37,375
Siddharth must think that
he is the only suspect…

1041
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:40,458
and Aditya must think that
he is the only suspect.

1042
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:42,833
Start the treatment.

1043
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:44,833
Until they tell the truth,

1044
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:46,583
don't even give them water.

1045
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:48,708
Siddharth is fine to deal with, sir…

1046
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:52,542
but Aditya is talking about some
old court cases in his defense.

1047
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:53,750
Shut up!

1048
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,333
Just do as I say!

1049
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:56,250
-Sir.
-Sir.

1050
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,167
Out!

1051
01:19:57,958 --> 01:19:58,833
Sarathy…

1052
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:01,417
he should not slip away from our
hands this time, at any cost.

1053
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,333
Right.

1054
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:04,292
Handle this case properly,

1055
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,167
but don't make it evident…

1056
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:08,333
that you are targeting him.

1057
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:09,708
I will take care of the rest.

1058
01:20:10,292 --> 01:20:13,250
If the murderer is Siddharth,
then our track is clear.

1059
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:18,375
But if it's Aditya, we will have to think
about what has to be done.

1060
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:20,875
They should not escape.

1061
01:20:25,042 --> 01:20:26,000
Take your shirt off.

1062
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:27,625
Why, sir?

1063
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:28,750
Just take off your shirt!

1064
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:38,917
What is that?

1065
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,875
That's a bruise from a rod
at the construction site.

1066
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,125
Take it off.

1067
01:20:58,375 --> 01:20:59,333
Hey!

1068
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:00,500
Take off your T-shirt!

1069
01:21:01,292 --> 01:21:02,667
Why can't you say it clearly, sir?

1070
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:14,667
What happened there?

1071
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:18,250
Idiot!

1072
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:19,792
What's that wound?

1073
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:26,333
It's from when my bike skid off the road.

1074
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:33,042
We've tortured them so much,

1075
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:35,250
yet, they're just repeating what
they've already said.

1076
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:38,500
It's a sheer waste of time to expect
them to cough out the truth on their own.

1077
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,000
Then what else can we do, ma'am?

1078
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:41,333
Who is Akash?

1079
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:43,333
What is his connection with these two?

1080
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,042
Who is Akash's murderer
out of the two of them?

1081
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:47,583
Why was he killed
in the first place?

1082
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,375
Once we get to know more about Akash…

1083
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:55,250
it'll be easy for us to find
out who the murderer is.

1084
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:56,625
Yes, ma'am.

1085
01:21:58,208 --> 01:21:59,958
Mr. Akash always used to be at home.

1086
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,792
It's very rare for him to go out.

1087
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:04,792
Most of the times, he'd play his
video games or he'd play his guitar.

1088
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:06,917
He used to be on his
computer for hours, sir.

1089
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:08,458
Are you and Akash best friends?

1090
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:11,292
Back in college, we were
in the same music band.

1091
01:22:11,542 --> 01:22:12,875
We were very close then,

1092
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:15,542
but as he left for the US,
we lost contact.

1093
01:22:15,792 --> 01:22:17,000
Why did he return to India?

1094
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:18,542
There is no particular reason.

1095
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:20,583
He just wanted to come
back, so he came back.

1096
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:21,917
For a job or anything like that?

1097
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,292
No… his father used to send
him money every month.

1098
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:26,500
So, he never even
thought of getting a job.

1099
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:28,458
Sir, Akash is a very good person.

1100
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:33,375
Once, when my son was suffering from
dengue, he took care of all the expenses.

1101
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,708
He didn't even deduct
the money from my salary.

1102
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:37,250
Love life, girlfriends?

1103
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:40,500
No… he was never
interested in all that.

1104
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:43,875
He told me once about a girl who
rejected his proposal in college.

1105
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,125
He was very reserved
when it came to women.

1106
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:49,042
Music and games were his only world.

1107
01:22:49,167 --> 01:22:50,250
Have you seen this guy?

1108
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,042
Have you seen this person anywhere?

1109
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:55,958
No, sir.

1110
01:22:56,542 --> 01:22:57,500
No.

1111
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:02,542
On the night of second,
I was suffering from fever.

1112
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,708
My partner was by my
side, taking care of me.

1113
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:07,833
Once I took my tablet and went to sleep,
he also went to his room, ma'am.

1114
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:09,583
He is talking about Aditya, ma'am.

1115
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,542
Both of them are frauds.

1116
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:12,833
Then, aren't any cases
filed against them?

1117
01:23:12,917 --> 01:23:15,417
Aditya's intelligence can be
seen in his ways of cheating.

1118
01:23:16,042 --> 01:23:19,167
His main target is the people, who
want to earn money via illegal ways.

1119
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:23,792
So, nobody has filed a case against
him fearing that they'll also get caught.

1120
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:26,375
He was supposed to go to jail
in a case recently, ma'am.

1121
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,750
Aditya rescued him
quoting some legal point.

1122
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:30,208
What is his educational qualification?

1123
01:23:30,292 --> 01:23:31,375
-Winter.
-What?

1124
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:32,917
Inter, ma'am.

1125
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:36,458
How can an intermediate passed
person have so much legal knowledge?

1126
01:23:36,542 --> 01:23:37,667
I'd asked him that, ma'am.

1127
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:44,542
He said that people should stop poking
their nose in other people's lives.

1128
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:45,458
You…

1129
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:48,833
I Apollo fish if I said
something wrong, ma'am.

1130
01:23:48,917 --> 01:23:49,833
"Apollo fish"?

1131
01:23:49,917 --> 01:23:51,083
He meant, "apologize," ma'am.

1132
01:23:51,417 --> 01:23:52,583
Yes. We can say that, as well.

1133
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:54,333
We will call you as and when required.

1134
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:57,708
You're not allowed to go anywhere
until this case is solved. Got it?

1135
01:23:57,917 --> 01:23:58,875
Okay, ma'am.

1136
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:03,833
Don't forgo any information about Aditya.

1137
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:04,792
Yes, ma'am.

1138
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:05,958
What?

1139
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:09,250
Sorry, ma'am. I didn't hear it properly.
I will find out from Raghav.

1140
01:24:09,875 --> 01:24:10,708
-Pydi.
-Yes, ma'am.

1141
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:13,292
I need the phone records
of Aditya, Akash, and Siddharth.

1142
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:15,292
-Including Akash's bank statement.
-Okay, ma'am.

1143
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:21,042
Give me the list of all those people,
who had booked a cab that night.

1144
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:40,292
You're not allowed to go anywhere
until this case is solved.

1145
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:41,333
-Got it?
-Okay, ma'am.

1146
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:58,708
Sir!

1147
01:25:00,917 --> 01:25:05,583
I have checked all the call data
of Siddharth, Aditya and Akash.

1148
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:09,583
Siddharth and Aditya have no
connection whatsoever with Akash.

1149
01:25:09,917 --> 01:25:11,417
And what about
Siddharth and Aditya?

1150
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,625
No, sir. All three have
very different lifestyles.

1151
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:16,000
None of them have any kind
of association with the other.

1152
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:21,417
Also, I got to know during my inquiry
that Akash is a very fair person.

1153
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,958
He doesn't even have any weakness.

1154
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:27,375
His sister said that his locker
always used to have a lot of cash.

1155
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:29,917
So, I asked for Akash's bank
statement to be collected.

1156
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,833
What about the cab driver?

1157
01:25:32,042 --> 01:25:33,208
We have informed everyone.

1158
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:36,542
-We'll get an answer by tomorrow evening.
-Why is it taking so much time?

1159
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,500
We had only two days,
and one day is already gone.

1160
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:44,000
I want a piece of strong evidence against
Siddharth to prove that he's the murderer!

1161
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:48,958
I mean, Siddharth or Aditya.

1162
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:53,208
You may go.

1163
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:54,375
Yes, sir.

1164
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:04,583
We are missing out on
a very small detail, Pydi.

1165
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:10,708
I know there's something going on,
but I'm not able to put my finger on it.

1166
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:15,042
What is the issue between
Mr. Nagendra and Siddharth?

1167
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:16,750
Good evening, ma'am.

1168
01:26:18,167 --> 01:26:19,750
It's okay, ma'am. It's just Sudhakar.

1169
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:21,792
Although, it seems like he can hear
us, he can't.

1170
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:23,875
What is the problem between
the Circle Inspector and Siddharth?

1171
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:26,167
Sir Nagendra has one daughter, ma'am.

1172
01:26:26,667 --> 01:26:28,958
She loved someone
during her college days.

1173
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:30,792
That boy belonged to a different caste.

1174
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:33,833
Sir was against their love, so he fixed
his daughter's marriage with someone else.

1175
01:26:33,917 --> 01:26:39,583
Just two days before the wedding,
she eloped with her lover and married him.

1176
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:43,167
Siddharth took care of everything,
from helping her elope with her lover…

1177
01:26:43,542 --> 01:26:45,542
to their wedding.

1178
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:49,708
Because her lover and Siddharth
are very good friends.

1179
01:26:50,792 --> 01:26:51,833
The highlight is that…

1180
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:55,833
sir has no clue where his daughter
is, to date.

1181
01:26:56,667 --> 01:26:59,667
Now, if he's getting a chance to seek his
revenge, why wouldn't he take it?

1182
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:04,458
Even if Aditya is the murderer,
he will try to push it on Siddharth.

1183
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:07,667
I've heard it all.

1184
01:27:10,167 --> 01:27:12,875
Is your caste more important to you
than your daughter, Pydi?

1185
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,208
How could you say that?

1186
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:19,292
You don't know your daughter's
whereabouts. How is that a "highlight"?

1187
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:21,542
Ma'am, please make him understand.

1188
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:24,042
What kind of a man are you!

1189
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:26,417
See how he misunderstood everything!

1190
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:28,875
Unless we get some additional evidence…

1191
01:27:29,917 --> 01:27:31,458
we can't do anything about this, Pydi.

1192
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:34,750
Hello!

1193
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:35,833
Hello, Yamu.

1194
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:37,042
This is Purushotham.

1195
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:40,542
Who gave my number to Purushotham?

1196
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:43,250
I did, because he wanted
to talk to you about the case.

1197
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:46,125
I had changed my number because
of his constant nagging.

1198
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:47,292
Sorry, ma'am.

1199
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:50,000
"I had changed my number because
of his constant nagging."

1200
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:51,625
Isn't that what you just said?

1201
01:27:51,708 --> 01:27:52,667
I could sense it.

1202
01:27:53,792 --> 01:27:56,125
I am in a tense situation.
Tell me, why did you call me?

1203
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:58,083
I had--

1204
01:27:58,167 --> 01:27:59,125
I'm on a personal call.

1205
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:03,125
I'd called you to tell you that you
need not be tensed anymore.

1206
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:05,792
-Why?
-Akash's case has been solved.

1207
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:08,167
-What?
-It's exactly what you just heard.

1208
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:10,583
Akash's case has been solved.

1209
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:12,792
-What are you talking about?
-It's the truth!

1210
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:15,917
Before I tell you this truth,
I need to know something.

1211
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:16,958
What is it?

1212
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:18,208
Why did you reject…

1213
01:28:18,667 --> 01:28:22,875
my marriage proposal three months back?

1214
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,625
If you're going to ask me such
idiotic questions at this time,

1215
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:29,125
I'll have to use some cuss words!

1216
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:30,833
-What?
-I wasn't talking to you.

1217
01:28:31,208 --> 01:28:32,667
I know you wouldn't say that to me.

1218
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,042
Anyway, I'll come to the point.

1219
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,583
My team has collected a hair
sample from the murder spot.

1220
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:40,000
Of the murderer?

1221
01:28:40,417 --> 01:28:41,292
Of course!

1222
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:42,292
You must be aware…

1223
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:43,833
that we have already tested the DNA

1224
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:46,333
from the hair samples of
everyone associated with Akash.

1225
01:28:46,458 --> 01:28:49,875
<i>Nobody's DNA matched with the DNA
of the hair sample found at the spot.</i>

1226
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:51,458
Who else is left then?

1227
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:55,125
So, if you send the hair sample
of the suspect immediately…

1228
01:28:55,417 --> 01:28:57,208
the case will be solved
by tomorrow morning.

1229
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:00,667
-Pydi.
-Ma'am!

1230
01:29:01,792 --> 01:29:03,292
We've got the additional evidence.

1231
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:08,958
No matter what the crime is,
no matter how clever the culprit is…

1232
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,833
he is bound to be found at some point.

1233
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:15,833
He got caught with the help
of just a strand of his hair.

1234
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:21,167
We did not expect this
case to be solved so easily.

1235
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:24,708
Siddharth and Aditya's hair
samples were sent to the lab.

1236
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,167
Hey!

1237
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:42,833
Move!

1238
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:51,167
Hey, what is it?

1239
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:52,708
I need to use the men's room.

1240
01:29:52,792 --> 01:29:53,792
All right!

1241
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,583
What are you looking at?

1242
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:08,542
Hey!

1243
01:30:09,542 --> 01:30:10,375
Hey!

1244
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,417
Open the door!

1245
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:16,667
Hey, stop!

1246
01:30:18,792 --> 01:30:19,917
Hey, stop!

1247
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:21,708
Hey!

1248
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:24,042
Catch him!

1249
01:30:24,417 --> 01:30:25,250
Hey!

1250
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:31,958
Hey, stop!

1251
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:08,833
Hey!

1252
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:43,333
Sir, Aditya and Siddharth
are fighting with each other!

1253
01:31:43,417 --> 01:31:44,250
Come quickly, sir!

1254
01:31:51,417 --> 01:31:52,375
Hey!

1255
01:31:58,042 --> 01:31:58,875
Hey!

1256
01:31:58,958 --> 01:32:01,875
-Did you call the Assistant Sub-Inspector?
-Yes, sir! He is on the way!

1257
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,250
Stop them!

1258
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:18,792
Stop him!

1259
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,583
Hey!

1260
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:28,625
Stop it!

1261
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:32,833
-Let go of him right now!
-Hey, stop it!

1262
01:32:34,042 --> 01:32:36,417
Let go! If I hit you,
your nose will be squashed.

1263
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:11,167
Hey!

1264
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:31,708
Hey, push him aside!

1265
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:43,583
I am sure he is the murderer.

1266
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:45,250
Else, why would he try to escape?

1267
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:49,958
Sit down!

1268
01:33:51,083 --> 01:33:52,042
Oh, God!

1269
01:33:52,292 --> 01:33:54,000
Your nose got squashed as he hit you.

1270
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:55,083
Sudha…

1271
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:57,417
it must be by mistake.

1272
01:33:58,042 --> 01:34:00,125
He hit you without missing an inch.

1273
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:01,500
-Really?
-Sir!

1274
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:02,917
-Yes?
-Did you realize something?

1275
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,792
-What?
-They already know each other.

1276
01:34:06,083 --> 01:34:08,083
And they hate each other, as well.

1277
01:34:08,917 --> 01:34:10,208
They hate each other.

1278
01:34:14,917 --> 01:34:15,875
Morning, Yamu!

1279
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:18,458
-I was expecting you.
-What happened?

1280
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:21,750
You look like a perfect
bride even in your uniform.

1281
01:34:23,042 --> 01:34:25,125
I tested the hair samples
as soon as I received them.

1282
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:28,000
The DNA from the murder
spot and the DNA…

1283
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:32,250
from the sample you
sent, matched perfectly.

1284
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:35,750
I wanted to call you and inform the same,

1285
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:37,417
-but--
-What?

1286
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:41,000
Although, I'd got the confirmation
from the first sample…

1287
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:43,417
I also checked the second
sample as a formality.

1288
01:34:43,542 --> 01:34:44,542
And the twist is…

1289
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:49,333
not only the sample
from the first suspect…

1290
01:34:49,542 --> 01:34:51,667
but the sample from the second
suspect also matched perfectly

1291
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:53,375
with the hair sample found at the spot!

1292
01:34:54,542 --> 01:34:56,250
-Are there two suspects?
-Yes.

1293
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:58,125
Are they identical?

1294
01:34:59,208 --> 01:35:03,458
If their DNAs are also the same, then
both the suspects in your custody are…

1295
01:35:03,917 --> 01:35:04,917
Identical twins!

1296
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:07,792
I was born 15 seconds
after Siddharth was born.

1297
01:35:08,292 --> 01:35:10,125
Even a father and a son
have different DNAs,

1298
01:35:10,542 --> 01:35:12,417
-then--
-Correct.

1299
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:16,333
Not just a father and a son,
even normal twins have different DNAs…

1300
01:35:16,583 --> 01:35:20,958
but identical twins are two
lives formed from the same egg.

1301
01:35:21,458 --> 01:35:26,667
So, they not only look the same,
but their DNAs are also the same.

1302
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:31,250
So, there is no use of this evidence.

1303
01:35:34,958 --> 01:35:37,625
The moment I'd got the photo as the
evidence, I thought the case was solved.

1304
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:39,125
But then, we found one more guy!

1305
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:41,333
No matter how much we torture them,

1306
01:35:41,417 --> 01:35:43,250
neither of them is ready
to accept the crime.

1307
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:45,667
What else can be there other than a DNA?

1308
01:35:46,542 --> 01:35:48,583
Here, I was thinking
the case has been solved.

1309
01:35:49,292 --> 01:35:51,542
-Now, what?
-Hey, don't worry.

1310
01:35:51,792 --> 01:35:52,792
There is another option.

1311
01:35:52,875 --> 01:35:54,167
-What is it?
-Fingerprints.

1312
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,708
Though, they are the identical
twins with the same DNA…

1313
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:01,167
their fingerprints
ought to be different.

1314
01:36:05,667 --> 01:36:07,042
My team's checked the crime scene.

1315
01:36:07,125 --> 01:36:09,125
Had they found any fingerprints,
they'd have sent them to you.

1316
01:36:09,208 --> 01:36:10,792
I know how your team
looks for the clues.

1317
01:36:10,875 --> 01:36:11,792
Coffee.

1318
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:13,292
You may go.

1319
01:36:14,167 --> 01:36:16,458
This time, I will check the crime scene.

1320
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:19,375
Where is the point of entry?

1321
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:20,292
That way.

1322
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
The point of exit?

1323
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,458
It'd be the same as
the point of entry, right?

1324
01:36:24,542 --> 01:36:25,542
Why?

1325
01:36:25,917 --> 01:36:28,875
Look! When he was entering, there might
not have been anyone on the road…

1326
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:31,375
but as he was exiting,
there could have been someone…

1327
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:32,958
which made him take another exit.

1328
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:34,792
And this could be the exit.

1329
01:36:35,292 --> 01:36:37,708
Maybe, the fingerprints we are
searching for are right here.

1330
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:39,417
Give me the gloves.

1331
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:48,958
"If you love a person lovingly…"

1332
01:36:52,667 --> 01:36:54,583
"If you love a person lovingly…

1333
01:36:55,167 --> 01:37:00,208
the person who'll get your love,
will also love you lovingly!"

1334
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:01,833
How's it, Yamu?

1335
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:05,750
What happened?

1336
01:37:05,917 --> 01:37:06,958
Didn't you like it?

1337
01:37:07,458 --> 01:37:08,542
I felt…

1338
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,083
the same, actually--

1339
01:37:10,875 --> 01:37:11,875
He wrote this.

1340
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:14,708
I'd told him that it's bad.
Such an outdated fellow.

1341
01:37:15,417 --> 01:37:17,333
Yamini, I have a tricky question for you.

1342
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,042
Marriages are made in…

1343
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,458
Heaven!

1344
01:37:22,167 --> 01:37:23,083
No.

1345
01:37:23,542 --> 01:37:25,625
The right answer is,
"bharatmatrimonial.com."

1346
01:37:25,917 --> 01:37:28,292
That is where I saw your
beautiful profile picture.

1347
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:33,375
I know you are blushing.

1348
01:37:37,208 --> 01:37:39,250
I think, the murder happened
on the upper floor…

1349
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:42,250
but he fled down from here.

1350
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,500
I am not sure.

1351
01:37:45,708 --> 01:37:48,750
You said that the point of entry and
the point of exit need not be the same.

1352
01:37:48,833 --> 01:37:50,958
Then, why would he come down to flee?
He could have left from the upper floor.

1353
01:37:51,042 --> 01:37:52,000
Correct!

1354
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:54,833
I think, it is better to follow
your point of view.

1355
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:56,167
Isn't that common sense?

1356
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:57,833
-If we don't even know that--
-Shut up!

1357
01:37:59,292 --> 01:38:01,833
First, learn to make some good coffee!
Then, give an advice!

1358
01:38:03,042 --> 01:38:05,167
Take the cup! Bloody loser!

1359
01:38:05,542 --> 01:38:07,000
What are you doing in the forensics?

1360
01:38:07,708 --> 01:38:09,292
-What are you doing?
-Yamu.

1361
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:11,542
As per the forensics,

1362
01:38:11,958 --> 01:38:14,875
it'd be better if we think like a police
officer in this particular case.

1363
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:16,375
Else, the case cannot be solved.

1364
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:18,208
A waste fellow!

1365
01:38:18,375 --> 01:38:20,500
-I know you're not talking about me.
-I am!

1366
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:06,125
My parents had a love marriage.

1367
01:39:06,917 --> 01:39:08,750
My mother's parents were against it.

1368
01:39:10,083 --> 01:39:12,417
She still married my father
against her family's wish.

1369
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:15,208
My mother was a bank employee…

1370
01:39:16,458 --> 01:39:17,542
and my father was a lawyer.

1371
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:21,417
Just after a few years into the marriage,

1372
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,208
my parents started having
compatibility issues.

1373
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:25,250
-What does it mean?
-Difference of opinions.

1374
01:39:26,667 --> 01:39:30,417
Why don't you understand? You don't
have to earn and support this family!

1375
01:39:31,667 --> 01:39:33,583
Just stay home,
and take care of the kids!

1376
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:37,167
Why don't you answer me?
I'm shouting at the top of my lungs!

1377
01:39:40,542 --> 01:39:41,542
Have you gone mad?

1378
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,042
Why do you want a divorce all of a sudden?

1379
01:39:46,167 --> 01:39:48,125
Bharati, think twice
before you make a decision.

1380
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:50,167
It's not going to be of any use…

1381
01:39:50,792 --> 01:39:53,333
even if I think it over a 100 times.

1382
01:39:54,167 --> 01:39:55,417
Nothing can change my decision.

1383
01:39:56,708 --> 01:39:57,667
I left with my father.

1384
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:02,542
I left with my mother.

1385
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:08,667
I love you, dear.

1386
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:10,625
I love you too, Mom.

1387
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:15,750
Wow!

1388
01:40:17,083 --> 01:40:18,167
Thank you, Mom!

1389
01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:22,792
That is fine…

1390
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:25,333
but I heard that your mom
was addicted to poker.

1391
01:40:26,667 --> 01:40:27,917
Tell me about it.

1392
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,000
It is refreshing to hear about it.

1393
01:40:32,042 --> 01:40:33,208
Did he tell you about this?

1394
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:35,458
-He is dead!
-Hey!

1395
01:40:35,542 --> 01:40:36,833
-Hold him!
-Hey, stop!

1396
01:40:36,917 --> 01:40:38,542
-Hey!
-Hold him tight!

1397
01:40:38,625 --> 01:40:40,542
-You…
-Hey, sit! Sit down!

1398
01:40:40,708 --> 01:40:42,167
Don't let go of him! Hold him tight!

1399
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:43,292
-Hey, stop!
-Hey!

1400
01:40:43,792 --> 01:40:44,750
Sit down!

1401
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:48,792
Sit down.

1402
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:58,333
It's not easy for a woman to play
poker in a male-dominated club.

1403
01:41:01,542 --> 01:41:04,833
I know mothers who take their
children to schools, tuition, etc…

1404
01:41:06,542 --> 01:41:09,958
but for the first time, I'm hearing about
a mother who would take her kid to a club.

1405
01:41:13,458 --> 01:41:15,208
My mother was a university gold medalist!

1406
01:41:19,375 --> 01:41:22,625
As she graduated,
she was offered a job as a bank officer.

1407
01:41:25,458 --> 01:41:29,542
My mother wouldn't think
twice to help those in need.

1408
01:41:33,625 --> 01:41:35,250
Couldn't that rascal tell you this?

1409
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:14,917
How could you eat just anything!

1410
01:42:15,417 --> 01:42:17,708
-See! Now, you got sick.
-I was hungry, Mom.

1411
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:22,625
I am sorry, son.

1412
01:42:23,167 --> 01:42:25,792
I will not go to the club
from tomorrow onward.

1413
01:42:26,167 --> 01:42:27,083
Okay?

1414
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:41,750
Dad and I could never understand
why she got addicted to the club.

1415
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:43,458
What is there not to understand?

1416
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:47,917
My mother was not happy with the way
her life turned out after marriage.

1417
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:50,125
Grief and anger.

1418
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:52,708
They're not gender-specific.

1419
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:57,583
How many of you buy clothes
and biscuits for your children?

1420
01:42:58,083 --> 01:43:00,167
Do your children hate
you because of that?

1421
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:19,958
Mom.

1422
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:27,000
No matter how hard I try,
I am unable to get rid of this habit.

1423
01:43:30,042 --> 01:43:32,625
I am deeply burdened.

1424
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:36,292
I lost.

1425
01:43:38,708 --> 01:43:42,042
I lost the entire salary of this month.

1426
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:49,750
I don't know what's going on with me.

1427
01:44:07,542 --> 01:44:10,208
But why are you more interested
in our past than Akash's case?

1428
01:44:11,583 --> 01:44:13,458
First of all,
find out what you ought to know.

1429
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:15,292
Siddharth is a compulsive liar.

1430
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:17,083
He can only lie.

1431
01:44:17,875 --> 01:44:19,333
He is not as naive as he looks.

1432
01:44:20,083 --> 01:44:23,375
He got a psychiatric
treatment for a year.

1433
01:44:24,417 --> 01:44:25,625
Didn't he say that to you?

1434
01:44:26,292 --> 01:44:27,250
Me?

1435
01:44:28,667 --> 01:44:31,000
Call the Hyderabad Erragadda Hospital
and find out, sir.

1436
01:44:31,125 --> 01:44:33,375
Find out who was at the hospital…

1437
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:37,667
getting a treatment from
June 2006 to June 2007.

1438
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:38,917
I am sure they will tell you.

1439
01:44:39,167 --> 01:44:41,167
Call them and find out.
I also want you to do that.

1440
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:45,625
He ruthlessly stabbed the chief doctor
there with a fork he was eating with.

1441
01:44:47,458 --> 01:44:49,167
Half the fork was pierced into his neck.

1442
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:52,458
He was hospitalized for a month.
He was almost dead.

1443
01:44:53,125 --> 01:44:54,083
Me?

1444
01:44:55,792 --> 01:44:57,833
Sir, call them and find out who did it!

1445
01:44:58,167 --> 01:45:00,667
Then, you'll have a clear picture
of this murder case as well.

1446
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:07,708
You are right, ma'am.
He was the son of a lawyer.

1447
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,333
<i>He stabbed the doctor out of
anger for what the doctor said.</i>

1448
01:45:10,417 --> 01:45:11,292
What's his name?

1449
01:45:11,375 --> 01:45:12,333
I don't know, ma'am.

1450
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,125
This incident happened
about 12 years ago.

1451
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:15,625
<i>I've just joined four years ago.</i>

1452
01:45:15,917 --> 01:45:17,625
<i>I heard it from someone here, ma'am.</i>

1453
01:45:17,708 --> 01:45:18,833
What happened to the doctor?

1454
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:21,708
He was stabbed in the throat, so he could
not talk anymore.

1455
01:45:21,917 --> 01:45:23,208
<i>He died a year ago.</i>

1456
01:45:23,292 --> 01:45:25,958
I'm sure you note down the details of
the patients when they're admitted.

1457
01:45:26,042 --> 01:45:26,958
Right, ma'am…

1458
01:45:27,375 --> 01:45:30,500
but there had been a fire incident in
the building, so all the files got burnt.

1459
01:45:30,583 --> 01:45:31,792
A few files are in the storeroom.

1460
01:45:31,875 --> 01:45:34,042
I'll try to find out
and call you back, ma'am.

1461
01:45:34,667 --> 01:45:35,708
-Okay, ma'am?
-All right.

1462
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:48,917
-Tell me.
-I'm totally blank, Sarathy.

1463
01:45:49,875 --> 01:45:51,208
I'm unable to understand anything.

1464
01:45:51,292 --> 01:45:54,042
I was just doing your work.
I seem to have found a way out of this.

1465
01:45:54,625 --> 01:45:56,458
Give me some time.
I'll call you back.

1466
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:10,792
What is Aditya's problem?

1467
01:46:11,542 --> 01:46:12,833
He was already disturbed

1468
01:46:13,125 --> 01:46:15,125
when he came to live with us
after our mother's death.

1469
01:46:15,208 --> 01:46:17,667
He was temperamental, disturbed…

1470
01:46:18,208 --> 01:46:19,125
and frustrated.

1471
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:22,042
We were unable
to comprehend the situation.

1472
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:23,208
How did your mother die?

1473
01:46:23,625 --> 01:46:25,917
Jaundice… as stated by my father.

1474
01:46:26,708 --> 01:46:27,917
How did your mother die?

1475
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:33,292
Jaundice.

1476
01:46:43,583 --> 01:46:44,667
He is lying, Pydi.

1477
01:46:45,833 --> 01:46:48,250
Aditya knows the truth
about his mother's death.

1478
01:46:50,625 --> 01:46:52,125
Even Siddharth doesn't know about it.

1479
01:46:55,292 --> 01:46:57,833
How could she do this
despite having a kid!

1480
01:46:58,125 --> 01:47:00,792
Why should we bother? Leave it.

1481
01:47:00,875 --> 01:47:01,792
True.

1482
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:07,667
Mom!

1483
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,875
You are Bharati's son, right?

1484
01:47:13,042 --> 01:47:14,458
Your mother and I are colleagues.

1485
01:47:15,042 --> 01:47:17,917
She got unconscious in the club,
so I took her to a doctor.

1486
01:47:18,833 --> 01:47:20,083
The tablets are on the table.

1487
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:22,125
If you need anything,
ask your mother to call me.

1488
01:47:22,458 --> 01:47:23,583
Okay? Bye.

1489
01:48:28,417 --> 01:48:29,500
Wait a minute, dear.

1490
01:48:46,708 --> 01:48:49,125
There is nothing wrong with
me the way you're thinking.

1491
01:48:50,042 --> 01:48:51,667
Your mother is not that kind of a woman.

1492
01:48:54,125 --> 01:48:57,042
I grew up in a house, where
I could not be myself.

1493
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I didn't have any scope
to express my anger.

1494
01:49:00,083 --> 01:49:02,250
My father's mentality was such that…

1495
01:49:02,333 --> 01:49:06,500
he'd always judge me on the basis
of what other people talked about me.

1496
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:08,458
I couldn't take it.

1497
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:11,292
I felt like flying away
into the wilderness,

1498
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:13,917
but right then, your father came
into my life. We got married,

1499
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,875
and I thought that was
the end of my slavery.

1500
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:20,417
But later, I found out…

1501
01:49:21,042 --> 01:49:24,000
that I flew out of one cage
just to end up into another.

1502
01:49:24,333 --> 01:49:27,417
Earlier,
I was unable to question my father.

1503
01:49:28,083 --> 01:49:32,167
After marriage, I couldn't answer
the questions of your father.

1504
01:49:33,625 --> 01:49:35,833
I took you along,
and got out of that relationship.

1505
01:49:37,292 --> 01:49:40,708
Then, I realized that I'd
just got out of it physically,

1506
01:49:40,833 --> 01:49:44,583
but the grief and anger
within me still remained.

1507
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:48,458
We often forget that…

1508
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:51,458
grief and anger are not gender-specific.

1509
01:49:53,375 --> 01:49:56,250
Eventually, because of that,
I got drowned in my bad habit.

1510
01:49:57,250 --> 01:50:02,583
I thought, "At least, let me win a game."
Such was my stubbornness.

1511
01:50:03,833 --> 01:50:05,750
All that made me a slave.

1512
01:50:07,958 --> 01:50:09,792
But when I realized…

1513
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:15,000
my son has been crying in
the middle of the night…

1514
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:20,333
because of me,

1515
01:50:21,417 --> 01:50:22,458
I thought, that's enough.

1516
01:50:23,292 --> 01:50:27,417
My father or your father might be
responsible for the failure of my life…

1517
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:32,833
but I am the one
responsible for your life.

1518
01:50:33,708 --> 01:50:39,333
I swear… I will not go back to the club.

1519
01:50:43,875 --> 01:50:44,917
I love you, my dear.

1520
01:50:48,542 --> 01:50:50,500
I will not go to work today.

1521
01:50:51,375 --> 01:50:53,750
Don't go to play football
after school today.

1522
01:50:54,333 --> 01:50:56,250
Come home directly.

1523
01:50:57,417 --> 01:50:59,833
I will make your favorite dessert.

1524
01:51:00,542 --> 01:51:02,208
After that, we will go shopping.

1525
01:51:03,042 --> 01:51:04,000
Okay?

1526
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,333
I just changed my path,

1527
01:51:11,292 --> 01:51:13,125
because I did not like
the path that I was on.

1528
01:51:14,333 --> 01:51:15,333
But dear,

1529
01:51:16,458 --> 01:51:18,083
your mother never chose the wrong path.

1530
01:51:28,583 --> 01:51:31,167
Promise me that you'll
come home directly.

1531
01:51:34,708 --> 01:51:35,708
Please, trust me.

1532
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,875
If you think I am telling the truth,

1533
01:51:39,708 --> 01:51:42,125
you'll come home directly after school.

1534
01:51:42,542 --> 01:51:43,625
Don't go to play football.

1535
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:31,583
After my mother passed away,

1536
01:52:32,083 --> 01:52:33,625
my father got Aditya to stay with us.

1537
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,167
<i>I could sense a kind of
inferiority complex in him…</i>

1538
01:52:37,625 --> 01:52:39,708
<i>when he saw the things
I had, but he didn't.</i>

1539
01:52:46,083 --> 01:52:47,875
My father never bothered
to take care of me.

1540
01:52:49,083 --> 01:52:51,708
<i>Though, we were close physically,
I never felt close to him.</i>

1541
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:55,125
<i>Siddharth never treated
me like his brother.</i>

1542
01:52:57,375 --> 01:53:00,042
<i>I realized that I could not call
it my "home" without my mother.</i>

1543
01:53:00,375 --> 01:53:03,417
He would act according
to his whims and fancies.

1544
01:53:04,417 --> 01:53:06,042
<i>No matter which college he'd join,</i>

1545
01:53:06,125 --> 01:53:09,958
<i>he'd be given a transfer
certificate by that college.</i>

1546
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:12,333
Aditya.

1547
01:53:14,583 --> 01:53:15,625
-Aditya!
-Hey!

1548
01:53:15,833 --> 01:53:17,625
-Get down!
-Let go of me!

1549
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:18,750
What are you doing?

1550
01:53:20,917 --> 01:53:22,625
You are just like your mother,
living a dirty life!

1551
01:53:22,708 --> 01:53:24,292
How dare you say that about my mother!

1552
01:53:24,375 --> 01:53:25,667
How dare you slap my father!

1553
01:53:26,458 --> 01:53:28,792
-How dare you slap my father!
-Siddharth, control yourself!

1554
01:53:28,875 --> 01:53:30,833
-Stop it, Siddharth!
-How dare you!

1555
01:53:30,917 --> 01:53:31,875
Dad, let go of me!

1556
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:33,917
Get up! Stop it!

1557
01:53:34,333 --> 01:53:35,875
-You…
-Siddharth, stop it!

1558
01:53:40,542 --> 01:53:42,375
Hey, Aditya! Stop! Both of you!

1559
01:53:42,625 --> 01:53:43,625
Stop it!

1560
01:53:43,833 --> 01:53:44,875
Have you guys lost it?

1561
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:45,958
Stop it! Get up!

1562
01:53:46,875 --> 01:53:48,292
Stop it!

1563
01:53:49,208 --> 01:53:50,333
Are you guys crazy?

1564
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:51,958
-Hey!
-Hey, stop!

1565
01:53:52,958 --> 01:53:54,250
Do you want to kill each other?

1566
01:53:54,333 --> 01:53:57,042
My mother should've been alive!
You both should've been dead instead!

1567
01:53:57,125 --> 01:53:58,167
Aditya, wait!

1568
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:03,083
My father wanted me to take up
a career in law, like him…

1569
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:05,125
but I chose engineering.

1570
01:54:06,917 --> 01:54:08,042
Aditya took up law.

1571
01:54:09,958 --> 01:54:13,000
Not because he loved our
father, but because he hated me.

1572
01:54:13,583 --> 01:54:15,917
I realized this when he left
the law school within a year.

1573
01:54:16,875 --> 01:54:18,833
He always wanted to stay ahead of me.

1574
01:54:19,542 --> 01:54:22,500
I know three languages,
so he learned six languages.

1575
01:54:24,417 --> 01:54:27,292
He came home only
when he needed money.

1576
01:54:28,292 --> 01:54:30,792
Dad expired when I was in
the final year of my college.

1577
01:54:32,083 --> 01:54:34,750
After Dad died,
we had nothing to do with each other.

1578
01:54:35,625 --> 01:54:36,750
We went our separate ways.

1579
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:38,875
I also thought the same…

1580
01:54:40,875 --> 01:54:44,583
but I realized recently that
he has been following me.

1581
01:54:50,083 --> 01:54:51,958
<i>I started my own construction firm…</i>

1582
01:54:52,167 --> 01:54:54,375
<i>after I cleared my engineering
exam with a good rank.</i>

1583
01:54:54,458 --> 01:54:57,083
<i>My life was sorted, both,
personally and professionally.</i>

1584
01:54:57,333 --> 01:54:58,250
<i>I was very happy.</i>

1585
01:55:00,042 --> 01:55:01,333
<i>Aditya could not bear it…</i>

1586
01:55:02,125 --> 01:55:04,917
<i>because his life was a total disaster.</i>

1587
01:55:07,625 --> 01:55:09,833
<i>Unclear and hopeless.</i>

1588
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:12,042
<i>To add to it, he drinks,
smokes, and gambles.</i>

1589
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:16,583
He has a very different opinion on women.

1590
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,792
The only obsession he
has in his life is…

1591
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:21,583
me.

1592
01:55:40,667 --> 01:55:44,208
I knew he would try to disturb my
life, one way or the other.

1593
01:56:28,083 --> 01:56:29,083
-Hello.
-Hey!

1594
01:56:29,542 --> 01:56:31,167
I am unable to find the diamond
ring that I got for Mahima.

1595
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:32,125
What?

1596
01:56:32,208 --> 01:56:33,542
I am sure he is behind all this.

1597
01:56:34,583 --> 01:56:36,208
Do we know anyone from the police?

1598
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:37,833
Yeah, I will take care of it.

1599
01:56:38,042 --> 01:56:39,000
Listen…

1600
01:56:39,875 --> 01:56:40,833
don't do it officially.

1601
01:56:41,042 --> 01:56:42,333
Yes. I got it.

1602
01:56:47,667 --> 01:56:48,583
It's them, Siddhu.

1603
01:56:50,333 --> 01:56:51,750
We tried our best, sir…

1604
01:56:52,125 --> 01:56:53,792
<i>but if we push too hard, he may die.</i>

1605
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:56,375
There is no connection
between him and the ring, sir.

1606
01:56:56,458 --> 01:56:57,875
Okay. You can leave.

1607
01:57:06,375 --> 01:57:08,292
Open the drawer in your cupboard.

1608
01:57:14,208 --> 01:57:15,167
Do you see the ring?

1609
01:57:17,292 --> 01:57:19,208
I'd left a photo of our mother there.

1610
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:21,458
I'd come to take it back.

1611
01:57:23,708 --> 01:57:26,250
I just realized today that
I have so many body parts,

1612
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,125
<i>after you got me beaten up.</i>

1613
01:57:30,833 --> 01:57:32,667
I already had such deep hatred toward you.

1614
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:37,208
You've made another mistake today.

1615
01:57:39,458 --> 01:57:41,500
Now, the hatred has got more intensified.

1616
01:57:43,333 --> 01:57:45,333
You made me realize that
we share the same blood.

1617
01:57:48,875 --> 01:57:50,375
Now, I'll make you realize the same.

1618
01:58:01,875 --> 01:58:04,708
After that incident,
I directly saw him today.

1619
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:10,208
So, keeping that incident in mind,
he is trying to trap me in this case.

1620
01:58:11,083 --> 01:58:14,625
Ma'am, I think he is telling the truth.

1621
01:58:15,875 --> 01:58:17,083
Sir, he is lying.

1622
01:58:17,458 --> 01:58:19,875
Why would he try to escape
if he is not the murderer?

1623
01:58:24,625 --> 01:58:26,125
-Yes, Sarathy.
-Hey, Nagendra!

1624
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:27,750
We've found a way to trap Siddharth.

1625
01:58:27,833 --> 01:58:28,792
Thank you.

1626
01:58:31,125 --> 01:58:33,167
Our work is done.
Quickly come to my office.

1627
01:58:36,042 --> 01:58:37,042
Sir, Mr. Bhupati.

1628
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:39,583
Mr. Nagendra has called you both.

1629
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:40,875
Sudha, we'll be back.

1630
01:58:40,958 --> 01:58:42,125
Hey, he's called us.

1631
01:58:44,333 --> 01:58:45,542
-Raghav.
-Yes, ma'am?

1632
01:58:45,625 --> 01:58:47,208
-Why has he called them?
-I don't know, ma'am.

1633
01:58:47,292 --> 01:58:49,167
-He just told me to call them.
-Okay, go.

1634
01:58:49,417 --> 01:58:50,375
Okay, ma'am.

1635
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:53,417
You have told us many things,

1636
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:56,583
but still, you haven't answered
Mr. Nagendra's one question.

1637
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,208
You left the party
citing a registration…

1638
01:59:00,917 --> 01:59:03,250
but you didn't go for any
registration the next day.

1639
01:59:03,833 --> 01:59:04,750
Why?

1640
01:59:10,083 --> 01:59:11,250
It's okay, you can tell me.

1641
01:59:11,542 --> 01:59:12,625
98824…

1642
01:59:13,625 --> 01:59:15,167
88431.

1643
01:59:16,167 --> 01:59:17,125
Shweta.

1644
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:19,875
Mr. Nagendra's daughter.
It's her phone number.

1645
01:59:19,958 --> 01:59:24,667
Yes, my husband and I had come
to Vizag to see Siddharth.

1646
01:59:25,208 --> 01:59:26,167
We talked to him.

1647
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:30,417
He understood our financial
problem and helped us.

1648
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:32,167
-What happened?
-Nothing.

1649
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,833
Mr. Nagendra will leave
no stone unturned…

1650
01:59:37,167 --> 01:59:38,375
in order to find them.

1651
01:59:42,333 --> 01:59:43,667
So, I did not reveal anything.

1652
01:59:45,917 --> 01:59:46,875
-Where is Mr. Nagendra?
-We don't know, ma'am.

1653
01:59:46,958 --> 01:59:47,792
He was speaking to someone over the phone

1654
01:59:47,875 --> 01:59:49,625
and then,
he left with Bhupati and Sudhakar.

1655
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:51,792
-Pydi.
-Yes, ma'am.

1656
01:59:52,458 --> 01:59:55,042
Can anyone of you open
a door without a key?

1657
01:59:57,958 --> 01:59:59,083
We all can do that, ma'am.

1658
02:00:07,292 --> 02:00:08,542
Search for the car keys.

1659
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:09,708
Okay, ma'am.

1660
02:00:10,875 --> 02:00:14,042
Ma'am, do you still not believe Siddharth?

1661
02:00:14,542 --> 02:00:17,292
He said that it took him three
hours to get back to home

1662
02:00:17,375 --> 02:00:20,125
on the night of the murder because
his car tire had got punctured,

1663
02:00:20,208 --> 02:00:23,500
but we have no evidence to prove that.

1664
02:00:25,208 --> 02:00:26,583
-All the cab services--
-Ma'am!

1665
02:00:27,375 --> 02:00:28,292
Car keys!

1666
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:33,042
Now, we'll get to know whether
Siddharth's telling the truth or no.

1667
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:39,750
I had a flat tire on the way.

1668
02:00:42,875 --> 02:00:45,083
He's telling the truth, ma'am.
The car has a flat tire.

1669
02:00:52,125 --> 02:00:54,708
-Hey, if the police come here--
-Police?

1670
02:00:55,417 --> 02:00:58,708
Tell them that you were sick on the night
of second, and that I looked after you.

1671
02:00:58,792 --> 02:01:01,125
They'll leave but before they come
back, you have to escape.

1672
02:01:01,208 --> 02:01:03,292
Keep traveling for two-three
days without any halts.

1673
02:01:03,667 --> 02:01:04,917
What about the police?
Why are you asking me to run away?

1674
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
What did you do?

1675
02:01:06,458 --> 02:01:07,750
From where you got the money
that you gave to Baabji?

1676
02:01:07,833 --> 02:01:09,958
No questions! Do as I say!

1677
02:01:13,667 --> 02:01:15,458
Don't you check the fuel in the vehicle?

1678
02:01:15,542 --> 02:01:16,583
Sorry, ma'am.
I'll get it in five minutes.

1679
02:01:16,667 --> 02:01:17,667
-Be quick!
-Okay, ma'am.

1680
02:01:18,292 --> 02:01:19,250
Okay, Raghav.

1681
02:01:26,292 --> 02:01:27,208
Ma'am.

1682
02:01:27,375 --> 02:01:28,250
What is it, Pydi?

1683
02:01:28,333 --> 02:01:29,833
I am sure Aditya is the murderer.

1684
02:01:31,417 --> 02:01:33,375
Aditya withdrew 11 lakhs
from his account…

1685
02:01:33,958 --> 02:01:36,042
just four days before Akash's death.

1686
02:01:36,125 --> 02:01:38,292
And the very next day,

1687
02:01:38,375 --> 02:01:40,083
he repaid his friend,
Vema's loan to Baabji.

1688
02:01:40,167 --> 02:01:43,708
Nine lakhs with interest.

1689
02:01:45,042 --> 02:01:48,667
To add to this, Vema has fled
from the city yesterday, ma'am.

1690
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:53,125
Mr. Nagendra had already got
this information in the evening.

1691
02:01:53,917 --> 02:01:58,500
They did not reveal it to you as they
didn't want their plan to fail, ma'am.

1692
02:01:58,708 --> 02:02:01,458
-What plan?
-Ma'am, on the very day of the murder,

1693
02:02:01,958 --> 02:02:04,792
<i>there had been a robbery at
a jewelry shop on the Bazaar Street.</i>

1694
02:02:05,542 --> 02:02:08,083
<i>No one knows who the culprit is.
It is an unsolved case.</i>

1695
02:02:08,542 --> 02:02:10,875
<i>So, Mr. Nagendra wants
to mislead this case</i>

1696
02:02:11,125 --> 02:02:13,542
<i>by framing Aditya in that robbery case.</i>

1697
02:02:14,042 --> 02:02:15,000
Put your finger there.

1698
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:17,375
Keeping his personal vengeance in mind…

1699
02:02:18,292 --> 02:02:20,583
Mr. Nagendra wants to trap
Siddharth in this murder case.

1700
02:02:20,917 --> 02:02:22,125
This is his master plan.

1701
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:23,958
Put your finger there.

1702
02:02:24,208 --> 02:02:25,208
Why, sir?

1703
02:02:25,333 --> 02:02:26,708
-It's for your own good--
-Wait.

1704
02:02:29,833 --> 02:02:31,708
The 11 lakhs…

1705
02:02:32,125 --> 02:02:35,792
in Akash's locker went
missing after his murder…

1706
02:02:36,958 --> 02:02:39,458
and the very next day,
you gave nine lakhs to Baabji,

1707
02:02:39,833 --> 02:02:42,917
and repaid your friend, Vema's loan.

1708
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,833
This one point is more than enough
to prove that you are the murderer.

1709
02:02:56,333 --> 02:02:58,042
I won that money in
the game of poker, sir.

1710
02:02:58,125 --> 02:02:59,083
What?

1711
02:02:59,417 --> 02:03:02,208
I won those nine lakhs in
the game of poker.

1712
02:03:05,833 --> 02:03:06,833
Ratanlal.

1713
02:03:07,333 --> 02:03:09,417
We play poker once every
month at our guest house.

1714
02:03:09,917 --> 02:03:11,833
Minimum amount
for the entry is one lakh, sir.

1715
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:15,042
Aditya was here on
the night of second, sir.

1716
02:03:15,417 --> 02:03:18,083
He played all through the night
and earned ten lakhs.

1717
02:03:18,625 --> 02:03:20,208
Will you say this in the court as it is?

1718
02:03:20,292 --> 02:03:21,292
I will, sir.

1719
02:03:21,625 --> 02:03:24,500
The Assistant Commissioner of Police
also comes to our guest house.

1720
02:03:26,417 --> 02:03:27,375
Thank you, sir.

1721
02:03:29,417 --> 02:03:30,250
Sir.

1722
02:03:30,417 --> 02:03:32,833
The case has been solved.
Siddharth is the culprit.

1723
02:03:33,875 --> 02:03:34,833
Okay.

1724
02:03:35,958 --> 02:03:37,167
The case has been solved.

1725
02:03:37,333 --> 02:03:38,458
Aditya is the culprit.

1726
02:03:39,875 --> 02:03:41,958
Along with your ears,
have you lost your mind as well?

1727
02:03:42,042 --> 02:03:43,833
I'd got a call from the station, sir.

1728
02:03:43,917 --> 02:03:46,000
I hope you remember that
Siddharth had told us

1729
02:03:46,083 --> 02:03:47,958
a cab driver helped him for
his punctured tire that day.

1730
02:03:48,042 --> 02:03:50,000
That cab driver is at our
station right now, sir.

1731
02:03:50,417 --> 02:03:52,958
Sir, why are you not reacting to-- Sir!

1732
02:03:53,667 --> 02:03:55,625
We have already informed
all the cab services.

1733
02:03:55,792 --> 02:03:57,292
We've almost inquired all of them.

1734
02:03:57,375 --> 02:03:59,708
Rest of them who haven't been
inquired, are coming to the station.

1735
02:03:59,792 --> 02:04:01,333
He'd gone to Hyderabad two days ago.

1736
02:04:01,417 --> 02:04:03,375
Just one hour ago,
he came to the station, sir.

1737
02:04:04,917 --> 02:04:07,542
This cab driver helped Siddharth
with his car's punctured tire.

1738
02:04:08,125 --> 02:04:09,333
Is the information genuine?

1739
02:04:09,542 --> 02:04:10,500
Yes, sir.

1740
02:04:12,458 --> 02:04:13,875
The owner told us that Aditya…

1741
02:04:14,667 --> 02:04:19,417
was indeed at their guest house playing
poker on the night of the murder.

1742
02:04:20,167 --> 02:04:22,667
So, Aditya hasn't killed Akash.

1743
02:04:23,917 --> 02:04:25,458
Also, the cab driver is the witness…

1744
02:04:26,208 --> 02:04:28,250
for when Siddharth's car
had a punctured tire.

1745
02:04:28,542 --> 02:04:30,583
He had helped him on
the night of the murder.

1746
02:04:31,167 --> 02:04:34,125
So, it's not Siddharth who killed Akash.

1747
02:04:35,208 --> 02:04:38,583
There is no other option but
to present them in the court.

1748
02:04:39,417 --> 02:04:40,667
Only the court has to decide.

1749
02:04:44,750 --> 02:04:47,958
After all of this,
we were back to square one!

1750
02:04:48,667 --> 02:04:50,292
We had no clue what was happening.

1751
02:04:50,708 --> 02:04:52,208
The case went on for seven months.

1752
02:04:52,292 --> 02:04:54,750
And finally,
the day of judgment arrived.

1753
02:04:55,167 --> 02:04:57,708
CC 220/2019!

1754
02:04:58,042 --> 02:04:59,583
Aditya and Siddharth!

1755
02:05:00,958 --> 02:05:03,375
We didn't expect that the court
would give such a verdict.

1756
02:05:10,083 --> 02:05:11,667
There is no doubt that…

1757
02:05:12,250 --> 02:05:13,792
one of you is the murderer.

1758
02:05:16,958 --> 02:05:19,417
But the prosecution has failed…

1759
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:23,042
to prove who that murderer is.

1760
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:29,167
Don't you think the law
wants to punish the real culprit?

1761
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:35,042
But what can we do if we
have no idea who that is?

1762
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:37,917
The law cannot punish the both of you…

1763
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:43,542
because one of you is innocent.

1764
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:47,292
"Doesn't matter if a hundred
culprits escape,

1765
02:05:47,542 --> 02:05:49,750
but not a single innocent
person should be punished."

1766
02:05:50,083 --> 02:05:52,458
This is the first rule of the law.

1767
02:05:54,708 --> 02:05:57,625
I have to give the judgment based
on the evidence presented to me.

1768
02:05:58,250 --> 02:05:59,083
TRUTH ALWAYS WINS

1769
02:05:59,167 --> 02:06:01,292
Are you the one who
investigated this case?

1770
02:06:01,667 --> 02:06:02,625
Yes, Your Honor!

1771
02:06:02,875 --> 02:06:04,750
It's a black mark for your department.

1772
02:06:09,625 --> 02:06:13,458
In Akash's case,
the guilty could not be proved.

1773
02:06:14,583 --> 02:06:18,167
Therefore, both the suspects,
Siddharth and Aditya…

1774
02:06:19,458 --> 02:06:22,083
are set free.

1775
02:06:26,583 --> 02:06:28,500
Sir, did they really
release the both of them?

1776
02:06:29,083 --> 02:06:29,917
Yes.

1777
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,333
But sir, who exactly
is guilty of the crime?

1778
02:06:36,542 --> 02:06:37,458
We don't know.

1779
02:06:37,542 --> 02:06:38,875
-We have no clue.
-We don't know.

1780
02:06:42,167 --> 02:06:44,583
Ma'am, we are moving
everything to the upper floor.

1781
02:06:44,708 --> 02:06:46,625
-Do you want your files to be moved?
-Okay.

1782
02:06:50,958 --> 02:06:52,667
I'd asked you to put this picture
back in Siddharth's house!

1783
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:54,042
Sorry, ma'am. It skipped my mind.

1784
02:06:54,125 --> 02:06:55,958
I'll send it back with Raghav.

1785
02:06:58,667 --> 02:06:59,875
Oh, that girl.

1786
02:07:00,625 --> 02:07:04,000
The case went on for seven months, but she
didn't come to see Siddharth even once.

1787
02:07:04,667 --> 02:07:07,583
I'd asked him about this girl when
I found this picture in his house.

1788
02:07:08,875 --> 02:07:10,625
He told us that she broke up with him,

1789
02:07:10,708 --> 02:07:12,458
because we charged him
and put him in jail.

1790
02:07:27,417 --> 02:07:28,333
What happened, ma'am?

1791
02:07:28,417 --> 02:07:29,667
What are you thinking about?

1792
02:07:34,083 --> 02:07:36,625
The first time we brought in
Siddharth for questioning…

1793
02:07:38,083 --> 02:07:40,167
we had showed him our photo evidence.

1794
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:41,708
Do you remember?

1795
02:07:44,958 --> 02:07:46,542
Pydi… do you remember?

1796
02:07:47,708 --> 02:07:48,625
Yes, ma'am.

1797
02:07:53,625 --> 02:07:57,042
He kept quiet when
he saw the photo then.

1798
02:07:58,250 --> 02:08:01,208
He did not even talk
about his twin brother.

1799
02:08:02,458 --> 02:08:04,583
We are missing out on
a very small detail, Pydi.

1800
02:08:07,417 --> 02:08:10,667
I know there's something going on,
but I'm not able to put my finger on it.

1801
02:08:15,333 --> 02:08:16,917
-Hello?
-Yamini here.

1802
02:08:17,333 --> 02:08:18,458
MVP Station Sub-Inspector.

1803
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:19,667
Yes, ma'am.

1804
02:08:20,292 --> 02:08:24,000
You'd told me about a girl,
whom Akash loved back in college.

1805
02:08:24,250 --> 02:08:25,250
Yes.

1806
02:08:26,042 --> 02:08:27,375
What is her name?

1807
02:08:30,458 --> 02:08:31,375
Mahima.

1808
02:09:01,667 --> 02:09:04,292
Mahima was supposed to be in
Kolkata for her friend's wedding,

1809
02:09:04,375 --> 02:09:05,458
but she never got there.

1810
02:09:05,542 --> 02:09:07,208
I tried many times to call her,

1811
02:09:07,542 --> 02:09:09,417
but her phone was always switched off.

1812
02:09:12,583 --> 02:09:14,833
Siddharth, sorry to say this…

1813
02:09:15,042 --> 02:09:17,542
and I am not sure if it's
right for me to tell you this,

1814
02:09:17,625 --> 02:09:19,833
but the situation is such
that I have to tell you.

1815
02:09:19,917 --> 02:09:21,333
I got to know that…

1816
02:09:21,958 --> 02:09:25,333
she left Vizag with some guy,
and they got down at the next station.

1817
02:09:26,875 --> 02:09:28,333
It seems that they were very close.

1818
02:09:32,458 --> 02:09:34,667
I know Mahima very well.
She is not that kind of a girl.

1819
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:36,917
Siddharth,
someone I know saw them together!

1820
02:09:38,083 --> 02:09:39,542
I am telling you for your own good.

1821
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,417
Don't waste your time.

1822
02:09:41,917 --> 02:09:42,833
Forget about her.

1823
02:09:44,208 --> 02:09:45,875
Do you know…

1824
02:09:46,125 --> 02:09:47,333
who that guy is?

1825
02:09:48,375 --> 02:09:49,333
Akash.

1826
02:09:52,125 --> 02:09:53,250
He was in Mahima's college.

1827
02:10:07,583 --> 02:10:09,000
I spiked Mahima's drink.

1828
02:10:11,833 --> 02:10:15,042
When she was unconscious,
I took her with me.

1829
02:10:17,708 --> 02:10:21,333
I injected drugs into her. I got
physical with her for two days in a row.

1830
02:10:38,083 --> 02:10:40,458
Nobody ever says "no" to me!

1831
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,375
Then, I killed her with a drug overdose.

1832
02:10:47,292 --> 02:10:48,708
I gave ten lakhs to the police…

1833
02:10:49,042 --> 02:10:51,000
to make sure they don't
file any case against me!

1834
02:10:51,417 --> 02:10:55,375
She kept saying your name
until her last breath.

1835
02:11:59,667 --> 02:12:00,500
Ma'am.

1836
02:12:03,125 --> 02:12:05,667
This report has been sent by
the Hyderabad Erragadda Hospital.

1837
02:12:09,208 --> 02:12:11,208
They did not get the exact
details we asked for,

1838
02:12:11,292 --> 02:12:13,667
but they've sent the papers
related to Siddharth

1839
02:12:13,750 --> 02:12:15,375
and Aditya from the chief doctor's files.

1840
02:12:15,458 --> 02:12:18,458
So, who was taking the treatment?
Siddharth or Aditya?

1841
02:12:20,042 --> 02:12:21,000
Both.

1842
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,708
Yes, ma'am. Siddharth was there for three
months, and Aditya was there for a year.

1843
02:12:26,958 --> 02:12:30,167
They both had got into a deadly fight
with each other when they were 16.

1844
02:12:32,458 --> 02:12:34,875
Please read the last line of that
report by the chief doctor, ma'am.

1845
02:12:34,958 --> 02:12:36,042
<i>That explains it all.</i>

1846
02:12:39,708 --> 02:12:44,042
"Though they hate each
other to the core…

1847
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:46,708
if they come across any problem…

1848
02:12:51,292 --> 02:12:52,292
they both become one."

1849
02:13:21,458 --> 02:13:24,083
When you tried to stop me when I was
escaping from the police station,

1850
02:13:24,167 --> 02:13:26,083
I thought you did it out
of your anger toward me.

1851
02:13:27,708 --> 02:13:29,750
But I realized later that
you'd come to help me.

1852
02:13:29,833 --> 02:13:32,083
I knew your focus was entirely
on Akash ever since…

1853
02:13:32,167 --> 02:13:33,875
you planned to kill him.

1854
02:13:35,375 --> 02:13:38,083
You were being careful to make sure
you don't leave any evidence…

1855
02:13:38,167 --> 02:13:40,000
but you weren't following
the investigation.

1856
02:13:41,333 --> 02:13:42,458
I was following it, though.

1857
02:13:52,417 --> 02:13:53,708
Because of that photo evidence,

1858
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,292
you got caught with no way out.

1859
02:13:59,250 --> 02:14:00,333
Airtight case.

1860
02:14:00,917 --> 02:14:03,417
You'd have got either a life imprisonment
or a death sentence.

1861
02:14:04,875 --> 02:14:07,958
I realized that you can get out
of the case only if I get in.

1862
02:14:20,167 --> 02:14:21,542
Hey, stop!

1863
02:14:21,792 --> 02:14:22,833
Sir, catch him!

1864
02:14:23,583 --> 02:14:25,000
Hey, stop!

1865
02:14:25,917 --> 02:14:26,917
Hey, you come along.

1866
02:14:31,333 --> 02:14:33,167
We'd sent his photo
across all our stations,

1867
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:36,583
so the sub-inspector of Madhurawada
Station identified him and sent him here.

1868
02:14:38,167 --> 02:14:42,000
I knew that Nagendra will go to any
extent with a vengeance to trap you.

1869
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,917
You're dead.

1870
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,167
He is the circle inspector.

1871
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:47,667
He can do anything.

1872
02:14:48,625 --> 02:14:50,583
I had to find a source to stop him.

1873
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,250
That's when I got to know…

1874
02:14:54,375 --> 02:14:55,292
about Yamini.

1875
02:15:01,208 --> 02:15:02,167
What happened, ma'am?

1876
02:15:03,625 --> 02:15:06,792
I entered the police station only after
I got all the information about her.

1877
02:15:07,667 --> 02:15:09,625
As soon as Aditya entered
the police station…

1878
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:13,083
he started playing mind games with me.

1879
02:15:16,083 --> 02:15:17,958
He made sure that I
keep my focus on him…

1880
02:15:18,875 --> 02:15:20,875
by diverting my attention
away from Siddharth.

1881
02:15:23,042 --> 02:15:24,167
He diverted me.

1882
02:15:28,667 --> 02:15:29,500
Idiot!

1883
02:15:29,833 --> 02:15:33,042
She'd got suspended for three months
for helping an accused in one case.

1884
02:15:33,833 --> 02:15:36,875
Though, she's a very sincere officer…
her basic nature is very mild.

1885
02:15:38,583 --> 02:15:41,500
I knew she'd be of great help
to us if I managed to trap her in my plan…

1886
02:15:42,292 --> 02:15:43,208
and I was right.

1887
02:15:43,458 --> 02:15:46,750
No one should know that I
arranged the cab driver.

1888
02:15:47,292 --> 02:15:48,417
It should stay between us.

1889
02:15:48,792 --> 02:15:51,167
What if she reopens the case
once she realizes the truth?

1890
02:15:52,542 --> 02:15:53,917
She must've realized it already,

1891
02:15:54,292 --> 02:15:55,958
but she can't do anything about it now.

1892
02:15:56,042 --> 02:15:59,292
Because she's the one, who arranged
the fake evidence for you.

1893
02:16:01,417 --> 02:16:02,667
If she reopens the case,

1894
02:16:02,875 --> 02:16:05,000
she'll not only lose her job but
also be charged for the crime.

1895
02:16:05,083 --> 02:16:07,917
So, the case ends at Yamini's end.

1896
02:16:10,667 --> 02:16:11,875
Who played the game, ma'am?

1897
02:16:12,875 --> 02:16:13,833
Tell me.

1898
02:16:19,292 --> 02:16:20,500
I don't have anything to say.

1899
02:16:25,917 --> 02:16:29,625
At the hospital, both of us were punished
as no one knew who between the two of us

1900
02:16:29,708 --> 02:16:30,958
had stabbed the chief doctor.

1901
02:16:31,958 --> 02:16:33,792
But when it comes
to the law, it's different.

1902
02:16:35,375 --> 02:16:37,583
This was the biggest
and the riskiest gamble of my life,

1903
02:16:38,542 --> 02:16:39,625
but it was worth the risk.

1904
02:16:40,083 --> 02:16:41,083
I won the game.

1905
02:16:44,542 --> 02:16:45,958
Why did you risk your life for me?

1906
02:16:47,917 --> 02:16:48,917
Not for you,

1907
02:16:49,625 --> 02:16:50,500
I did it for our mom.

1908
02:16:53,583 --> 02:16:55,208
You don't know much about our mother.

1909
02:16:57,542 --> 02:16:59,208
Whenever she used to buy a shirt for me,

1910
02:16:59,458 --> 02:17:00,750
she used to buy one for you as well.

1911
02:17:02,833 --> 02:17:04,458
She'd always cry whenever
she'd miss you.

1912
02:17:09,167 --> 02:17:12,875
Though she was happy that I was with
her, she always felt your absence more.

1913
02:17:16,792 --> 02:17:18,708
We are two different
people only for this world,

1914
02:17:19,125 --> 02:17:20,958
but not for our mom
who showed us this world.

1915
02:17:24,125 --> 02:17:26,583
Had she been alive today,
she'd have expected me to help you…

1916
02:17:26,667 --> 02:17:27,542
exactly the way I did.

1917
02:17:37,875 --> 02:17:41,458
When I didn't know where to go or what
to do, I found the right path to tread.

1918
02:17:43,208 --> 02:17:44,250
That path is Gayathri.

1919
02:17:46,167 --> 02:17:48,500
I want to marry her,

1920
02:17:48,875 --> 02:17:50,167
and start my life afresh.

1921
02:17:52,667 --> 02:17:53,667
What about you?

1922
02:17:54,875 --> 02:17:57,542
I am going to Mumbai,
and from there to Copenhagen.

1923
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:00,667
I don't intend to come back.

1924
02:18:18,083 --> 02:18:19,542
Probably, this is our last meeting.

1925
02:19:33,833 --> 02:19:39,125
<i>In silence, I seek your presence</i>

1926
02:19:39,417 --> 02:19:44,333
<i>Please come with me</i>

1927
02:19:45,083 --> 02:19:50,333
<i>It's morning already</i>

1928
02:19:50,667 --> 02:19:55,167
<i>But I am asleep dreaming about you</i>

1929
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:58,208
<i>Pay heed, I am your heartbeat</i>

1930
02:19:58,292 --> 02:20:01,042
<i>Do you have to stress
That I see you as me?</i>

1931
02:20:01,125 --> 02:20:03,875
<i>Shall we find a place
Where no one can find us?</i>

1932
02:20:03,958 --> 02:20:06,625
<i>And let our souls twine as one</i>

1933
02:20:06,708 --> 02:20:09,333
<i>Everyone lives alone</i>

1934
02:20:09,417 --> 02:20:12,917
<i>But from now onward
We'll live our life together</i>

1935
02:20:20,042 --> 02:20:21,000
What happened?

1936
02:20:24,792 --> 02:20:27,750
My grandfather couldn't
understand my mother.

1937
02:20:28,583 --> 02:20:30,333
My dad couldn't
understand my mother.

1938
02:20:31,833 --> 02:20:33,625
As a son,
I couldn't understand her either.

1939
02:20:34,875 --> 02:20:37,000
Had I understood her…

1940
02:20:39,083 --> 02:20:40,375
she would have been with us today.

1941
02:20:42,333 --> 02:20:43,333
I lost her.

1942
02:20:46,875 --> 02:20:49,375
A woman should've authored
the Ramayana, Gayathri.

1943
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:53,208
If that would have happened,
the idea of doubting…

1944
02:20:53,292 --> 02:20:55,292
a woman's fidelity
would have ended.

1945
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,833
I promise that I'll try to understand you…

1946
02:21:03,958 --> 02:21:05,292
because that's all I can do now.

1947
02:21:10,208 --> 02:21:15,375
<i>I am ready to lay down my heart for you</i>
