Getlost.

161
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:31,588
Buddha said believe nothing.

162
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:33,894
Justbecause the so-called
wise person said it.

163
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:35,060
Believe nothing.

164
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:37,362
Justbecause itis
said in ancientbooks.

165
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:38,494
Believe nothing.

166
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:41,064
Justbecause itis said
to be of divine origin.

167
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:42,365
Believe nothing.

168
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:44,468
Justbecause someone else believesit.

169
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:48,982
Believe onlywhatyou yourself
testand judge to be true.

170
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:49,981
Thankyou.

171
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:54,520
Everyreligion claims
to be the ultimate path to God.

172
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,682
Buteveryreligion
hasa differentconcept..

173
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:58,419
..ofwho orwhatGod is.

174
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:01,454
God exists.

175
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,660
lf God didn'texist, so many
people wouldn'tbe worshiping Him.

176
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,963
So many people can'tbe dumb.

177
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:09,829
He is so dumb. Do you know?

178
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:11,532
You were there forthe debate, right?

179
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:13,767
With greatdifficulty
l controlled mylaughter.

180
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,669
He justlooked cute.

You know Akhil uncle?

So?

1335
01:32:41,297 --> 01:32:43,731
Then mom said they are
havingan open marriage.

1336
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:44,925
What?

1337
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:47,433
lwasalso shocked.

1338
01:32:49,839 --> 01:32:51,807
l am very angrywith them.

1339
01:32:52,342 --> 01:32:53,900
lwas so proud ofthem.

1340
01:32:54,344 --> 01:32:57,040
Since childhood you have
an image ofyourparents.

1341
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,548
Theymusttake care ofit.

1342
01:33:02,886 --> 01:33:06,413
Because when thatimage breaks,
itfeelsverybad.

1343
01:33:06,923 --> 01:33:08,322
lthurts.

1344
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:10,987
You lose yourrespectforthem.

You actuallybegin to hate them.

1346
01:33:13,696 --> 01:33:15,288
You are right.

1347
01:33:16,766 --> 01:33:18,791
My dad is supercool.

Thank God forgiving

1351
01:33:29,412 --> 01:33:32,472
Otherwise nowadays you
don'tgetto see good fathers.

01:33:34,284 --> 01:33:36,411
Butyou also sleep around, right?

1353

They are parents, dear.

1355
01:33:40,423 --> 01:33:41,913
Theywere supposed to be in love.

1356
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:46,659
Maybe they are.

1357
01:33:50,767 --> 01:33:51,756

01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:25,243
''Letme walkwith you like that.''

1404
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:28,976
''Let'smake the momentsradiant.''

1405
01:37:29,785 --> 01:37:32,549
''Letitbe vague.''

1406
01:37:32,588 --> 01:37:34,579
''Letitbe hazy.''

1407
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:37,883

How old are you? -Why?

People have multiple personalities.

1422

Are you mad? No ways.

1508
01:45:09,745 --> 01:45:12,236
Do doctorsdischarge
someone so quickly?

1509
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,348
They also have to make money.

1510
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:16,342

Why did Ashwin kill hisdad?

1673
01:59:52,961 --> 01:59:54,952
Why did Sameerbreakmyheart?

1674
01:59:57,732 --> 01:59:59,666
