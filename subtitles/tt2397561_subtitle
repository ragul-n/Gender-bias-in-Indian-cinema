00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:16,855
Hail Sai!

2
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:31,695
Hail Sai!

3
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:55,958
Consecrating the divine Sri Sai
with the milk of holy Kamadhenu...

4
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:24,084
Consecrating the sweetness of sweet
of divine Sri Sai with honey...

5
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:47,607
Consecrating divine Sri Sai
with the cool sandalwood...

6
00:02:54,454 --> 00:03:18,643
Consecrating divine Sri Sai
with the holy water of river Ganges...

7
00:03:25,285 --> 00:04:00,009
Consecrating the luminescent Sri Sai
with the sacred ash...

8
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:24,875
Hail Sri Sai...dedicate the victory
to your holy feet...

9
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:41,555
This is lndia, holy land...
land of Karma.

10
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:47,223
Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and
Lord Buddha incarnated here.

11
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:52,236
lt produced seer like
Veerabrahmendra Swamy who foresaw future.

12
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:54,567
With the blessings of chaste women,

13
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:56,732
without following the
Karma of sins,

14
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,901
conducting good deeds only,

15
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,072
many a great Sages like Adi Shankaracharya,

16
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:06,912
were born in this holy
as representatives of God.

17
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:11,087
Sri Guru Raghavendra Swamy,
Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa,

18
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:13,384
Sri Ramana Maharishi,
such great ascetics appeared here,

19
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:16,585
they were accepted and
shown devotion like God.

20
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,922
Sainath is one of those great men.

21
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,928
Sai presides from the hearts of
millions of people all over the world.

22
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:28,768
To tell the truth, there's no place
in Telugu land without a Sai temple.

23
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:32,400
Where did he come from?
Who were his parents?

24
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,273
Who this great soul is?

25
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:36,609
Whose incarnation he is?

26
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:58,962
A wonder happened one day
on this universe...

27
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:05,135
Goddess Parvathi asked husband,
who the most chaste woman is?

28
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:17,314
Said Umapathy that Anasuya, wife of
Sage Athri, adopted son of Lord Brahma...

29
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,655
Hearing this, consorts of
Trinity got angry...

30
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:32,328
To test Anasuya, they sent
their husbands to her...

31
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:43,177
Anasuya offered payers to
the three divine guests...

32
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:56,692
Astonished to hear
to serve them nude...

33
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:11,602
Turning Trinity into infants,
she came nude...

34
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:21,510
The chaste woman breast fed the
Gods and became their mother...

35
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:31,725
Lakshmi, Saraswathi, Parvathi were
shocked seeing their husbands as infants...

36
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:39,066
They begged her to forgive them
and return their husbands...

37
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:48,412
Anasuya returned Trinity to their consorts
and became their mother-in-law...

38
00:07:50,083 --> 00:08:01,255
The power of Brahma, Vishnu,
Shiva were divested to Sage Athri...

39
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:06,259
Creator, protector and
destroyers of this world...

40
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:15,431
Brahma, Vishnu and Parameshwara
merged into one body...

41
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:22,674
Cow, symbolizing charity and
peace behind him...

42
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:31,114
Four dogs around him symbolizing
the four Vedas...

43
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:42,299
There are the five powers
that became Sri Datta...

44
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:52,139
Shone bright like
the light of dharma...

45
00:09:56,542 --> 00:10:18,694
Bow with devotion to Lord Shiva...

46
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:23,892
Looks like a young boy is
meditating under the neem tree.

47
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,231
Let's meet him.
- Come.

48
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,911
Who is he?
New to the place?

49
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,717
Don't know, never saw him before.

50
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,916
Why are his eyes closed?
- Shall we ask him?

51
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:51,586
Hey you! Who are you?
Why don't you answer us?

52
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:53,426
Hey you! Why don't you answer us?

53
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:57,091
Answer us...you...
- Boys, go away!

54
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:11,606
Ganga Bai, l see brightness
in the boy!

55
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:17,451
Yes, the boy looks like a young Yogi!

56
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,123
lt seems a boy is meditating
under the neem tree, aunt.

57
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:28,757
Yes, l too heard about him.
lt seems he's bright and divine!

58
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:32,461
Who could that boy's mother be?

59
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:36,130
lf he had parents, why would he
sit under a tree like an orphan?

60
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:39,767
But his face is divine!
- Yes, true!

61
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:57,657
Guru!

62
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,511
Guru!

63
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,821
Why are you shivering in fear?
Did you see snake?

64
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:31,690
Guru...
- Snake bit you!

65
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:33,526
When?
- Just now!

66
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:36,031
Really?
- We saw it with our eyes.

67
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,203
Then, see where the snake has gone!
- Come.

68
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:53,712
lt died! Oh my God!

69
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:57,050
Guru! What's this? Generally man dies
if a snake bites him.

70
00:12:57,223 --> 00:12:58,713
How come snake died after biting you?

71
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:00,723
lt wriggled and died miserably!

72
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:05,061
Who am l?
- You're village head!

73
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:07,062
1854!

74
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,724
Who is ruling our country?
- Englishmen!

75
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:11,860
What's their language?
- English!

76
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:20,068
We must speak English and
be barbaric like them.

77
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:23,409
lf anyone crosses swords with us,

78
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,244
they must die like that snake!

79
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:30,745
Oh! You're more poisonous
than a deadly snake!

80
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,757
Not just poisonous but
l've matter too!

81
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:36,760
Madam must tell about that.

82
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:41,896
What are these names?

83
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,264
Names of our children
l wish we had!

84
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,430
You always cared about interest and
money, never cared about me.

85
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:53,272
lt seems a boy is meditating
under the neem tree.

86
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:56,438
lt seems he's very cute,
bright and divine.

87
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,277
Let's adopt him as our son.

88
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,919
Why him? lf we keep a dog...

89
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,281
lt'll guard home.
- lf we have a rooster...

90
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:04,616
lt'll wake us early morning!

91
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,918
lf it fails to?
- We can cook and eat it.

92
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,458
Please listen to me.

93
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:12,792
Entire village is talking
great about that boy.

94
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:17,626
People must talk great
about Bhatia only!

95
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:20,465
l'll drive him away from here.
Come!

96
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,332
lf you're hungry,
please eat this chapatti, dear.

97
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,167
This tastes good!

98
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,333
Are neem leaves tasty?
lt's bitter, right?

99
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:00,741
ls it?
Eat and tell me.

100
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:15,525
lt's sweet like sugar!
- Really?

101
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:17,526
Let me also taste it.

102
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:28,002
Yes, it's sweet like sugarcane juice.
- lsn't it?

103
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:32,007
What are you saying?
How can neem taste sweet?

104
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:35,009
Just because we're listening,
are you narrating cock and bulls story?

105
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:38,206
Not by listening, taste to know it,
please give me also a leaf.

106
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:40,545
For us too!

107
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:50,889
lt's bitter!
- As you feel so it tastes!

108
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,554
Who are you?

109
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:54,024
Where have you come from?

110
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,901
Where did that lightning come from?

111
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,401
Where is your native place?

112
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:07,742
Which place does that thunder belong to?

113
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:11,239
Are you questioning me?

114
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:16,750
Okay, l'm asking as the village head.
What's your father's name?

115
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:17,752
l don't know.

116
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:21,052
Okay, who is your mother?
- l don't know.

117
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,423
He doesn't his own name, who his
parents are or where his place is,

118
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:28,499
were you born to wind? That's why
are you eating leaves like a goat?

119
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:30,933
You look like a mad boy!

120
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,439
lf one who eats leaves is mad,
then l'm mad!

121
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:39,073
Did you hear it?
He has accepted he's mad.

122
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,439
Look, l'm sparing you
because you're a boy,

123
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:44,276
enough these mad people around!

124
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,281
No place for the new!

125
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:49,615
Leave this place by tomorrow
morning, if not...

126
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,087
l'll show who l am tomorrow!

127
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,451
Why not now?

128
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:58,086
l'm not in a mood to beat.
- Go...
- Go!

129
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:01,464
Did you see the boy?
Did you like him?
- He's dead!

130
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:02,623
No hubby...

131
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:06,961
By morning he must leave this place!
- How dare he question me!

132
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:10,635
l'm not lucky to have
children anymore!

133
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:49,336
What a surprize!

134
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:52,507
lsn't this strange, Ganga Bai?
- Yes!

135
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:56,019
The tree is here,
fallen leaves are here.

136
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:58,350
But the boy is here to eat it.
- No!

137
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,355
What happened to him?
He ran away!

138
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:04,860
He ran away fearing me!

139
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,156
Don't talk like that, Bhatia!

140
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:07,855
Though entire village is
wet with rain water,

141
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:10,365
not a drop around this
neem tree, see!

142
00:18:10,536 --> 00:18:11,525
ls this logic?

143
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:14,696
Rain fell there and it didn't here.

144
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:18,173
lt rained in Khopargaon but not here!

145
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:21,369
There's water in the sky there but
no water in the sky above this tree.

146
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:22,172
How can it rain here?

147
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:26,875
Bhatia, the boy is truly divine!
Trust me!

148
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:30,378
That boy is a thief,

149
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:33,047
he has learnt tricks to cheat
and loot our village.

150
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:36,389
When l questioned him?
He ran away!

151
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:43,058
Go...go...go..
- Go home...go home...

152
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:45,067
What has happened to the poor boy?

153
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,062
Don't know where has he gone?

154
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:34,411
God is one!

155
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:52,527
There's one sun!

156
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:56,865
There's one moon!

157
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:02,201
There's one God!

158
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:13,208
lt's you who worshipped Rama
as God...

159
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:19,882
lt's you who venerated Jesus
as God...

160
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:27,461
lt's you who chanted Allah...

161
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:32,565
Let anyone call Him by any name...

162
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:36,902
Let them offer prayers
as they wish...

163
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:41,376
The one who created and
taking care of this nature is...

164
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:54,584
There's one God...
there's one and only God...

165
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:09,404
Raising the saffron flag and
chanting the sacred monosyllable...

166
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:13,408
You said it is Hindu religion...

167
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,409
Raising green flag with
crescent moon and star...

168
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:22,610
You said it is lslam religion...

169
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:26,952
Wetting the holy cross with
the blood of Jesus...

170
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:31,426
You said it is Christianity religion...

171
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,794
Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism...

172
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:40,132
Let it be any heart or any call...

173
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:44,435
The one who created and
taking care of this nature is...

174
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:57,886
There's one God...
there's one and only God...

175
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:27,843
Wind never shows any class
difference between king and poor...

176
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,357
lt is God's grace...

177
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,024
Whether is palace of gold
or a poor hut...

178
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:44,864
Rain showers same on
without any difference...

179
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:52,205
lt is God's mercy...

180
00:23:52,377 --> 00:24:00,876
God resides in the temples of
hearts of humane people...

181
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:07,390
Come out from the illusion
of caste and religion...

182
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:13,888
Everything is His image...

183
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:23,236
Every life is His incarnation...

184
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:24,962
l don't see anyone here!

185
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:28,800
Here!

186
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:29,963
Who is it?

187
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:56,995
Why are you looking shocked, Chand Bhai?

188
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:58,500
How do you know my name?

189
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:00,002
l know that's why l called you, right?

190
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:04,336
Then, tell me whom
l'm searching now?

191
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:07,171
For you missing horse Bijili!

192
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:10,338
Allah! You're right!

193
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,176
l never lie!

194
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:13,511
What is your name?

195
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:18,350
Nobody has called me
by any name till now.

196
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:22,357
You said so many things,
can you tell me where my horse is?

197
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:24,017
There, near the pond.

198
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:28,030
l was standing there till now
and shouting...

199
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:32,025
What did you do?
- l shouted and came.

200
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:36,864
lt'll not come if you shout.
Call with love it'll come.

201
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:40,038
Whatever work you do,
do it with dedication and softly.

202
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:42,202
Can l call it?

203
00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:53,213
Here it comes!

204
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:03,064
Allah willed it!

205
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:19,243
Thank you very much!

206
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:24,714
Your horse has come back,

207
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:27,255
will you smoke from your
favourite tobacco pipe?

208
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:30,088
l need fire to light it, right?

209
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:32,594
lf you ask, God will give anything.

210
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:48,610
You're not an ordinary man!
You're God!

211
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:51,445
God is one!

212
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,615
Are you from the nearby village?

213
00:27:53,752 --> 00:27:56,118
No! l've to go further up!

214
00:27:56,455 --> 00:28:00,619
There's a marriage in my village,
if you wish, you can join me.

215
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,117
l'll come but one condition!

216
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:07,959
lf l stop anywhere,
you mustn't ask me why?- Okay.

217
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:11,967
My carts are there! Come!

218
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:20,702
Come Sai!

219
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:23,200
Sai?

220
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:24,273
Baba!

221
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:27,368
Where were you all these days, Baba?

222
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:28,535
Baba?

223
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:32,847
Sai..? Baba...?

224
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:34,841
Sai Baba!

225
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:38,379
When asked your name,
you said you didn't know!

226
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:40,616
How would l know that's my name?

227
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:44,385
l'll answer if you call me
as Sai or Baba!

228
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:45,552
Move...move.

229
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,563
l'll call you as Fakir,
will you answer me?

230
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:52,866
lf you think l'm a Fair, then l'm!

231
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:54,868
You left this place,
why did you come back?

232
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:56,301
Why did you come back?

233
00:29:56,875 --> 00:30:01,574
This wind called me,
this land invited me! l'm here!

234
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:05,409
Looks like your madness has grown!
- ls he mad?

235
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:08,576
l missed my horse and was
searching for it everywhere,

236
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:11,586
he's the great man who told me
it is near the pond.

237
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:14,088
Told you great thing! Shut up man!

238
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:18,252
Any horse would go to the pond for
water, would it go to the rocks?

239
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:23,595
Keep quiet, Bhatia!
l know who he is!

240
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:30,765
When he first came to Shiridi,
l saw a wonder happen!

241
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:50,924
What? ls there a cellar
under the neem tree?

242
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:52,790
Did the boy enter it?

243
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:58,130
Lie but don't tell white lie!
White lie!

244
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:00,134
lf you don't believe, it's your fate!

245
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:02,933
Okay, let's dig under the tree.

246
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:07,305
lf there's no cellar as you say,
l'll bury you in the ditch.

247
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:10,642
Let's see whether l get buried
or your ignorance!

248
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:13,943
Why? Let's bury Bhatia
if there's a cellar!

249
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,642
Let's bury him!

250
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:30,217
Have you got sense at least now, Bhatia?

251
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:34,388
You said about burying Ganga Bai
if there's no cellar here.

252
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:36,397
As decided Bhatia must be
buried here.

253
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:42,234
Yes, bury Bhatia!

254
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:46,241
Sir, run away if not they'll bury
in the ditch you made!

255
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:48,242
lf they bury you there...

256
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:51,246
No need to light a lamp for you.
Already there are 5 lamps!

257
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:55,250
You fed us with your hands.
- We don't want to cover you with mud!

258
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,584
Cellar...lamps...mud!
They'll bury me!

259
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:02,423
Where's he?
- Where's he?

260
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,767
Please close this cellar!

261
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:18,504
This is the place of my Guru!
- Okay, Sai! Close it!

262
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:41,795
Hail Sai...

263
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:11,657
l seek refuge in you, Sainath...

264
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:21,000
Listening to the story of Sainath
cleanses all the sins...

265
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:30,138
Divine feet of Sai is
holy river Bhagirathi...

266
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:35,513
Chanting Sai's name is holy hymn...

267
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:54,365
Baba, you look like my brother.

268
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:57,372
Bhaicha, our relationship
isn't of this birth.

269
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,373
We've siblings for many births!

270
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:07,545
Seeking alms from people...

271
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:12,554
A mendicant who carries
sins of people...

272
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:23,898
Lighting the lamps with water...

273
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:28,903
He illuminated people with wisdom...

274
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:39,413
Coming!

275
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:48,416
Keeping the hand in fire...

276
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:54,425
A soul mate who saved the
life of a child...

277
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:23,787
Serving the diseased with devotion
and blessing them...

278
00:36:23,962 --> 00:36:29,798
He cured the disease and
became a God...

279
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:45,649
Giving new lease of life to
a mother who gives life to us...

280
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:55,486
Grinding the stone...

281
00:36:57,295 --> 00:37:00,162
Keeping disease at bay...

282
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,063
A noble spirit who saved poor
from the danger...

283
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:31,689
Where are you Sai?

284
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:37,028
Where are you?

285
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:44,437
l'm unable to walk,
please come to me...

286
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:52,206
l don't get peace till l see you...

287
00:37:54,719 --> 00:38:04,355
Are you always in meditation?
Don't you think of your hunger?

288
00:38:06,898 --> 00:38:11,358
Don't from which birth
relationship is...

289
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:16,233
Don't know how long
we've been indebted to each other...

290
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:21,243
Tell me Sai...

291
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:26,581
Tiger...tiger...

292
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:32,586
Every image is the mirror
image of itself...

293
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:37,759
A sage who emancipates
deadly beasts too...

294
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:49,097
When cyclones hit...
People run for cover...

295
00:38:49,273 --> 00:39:03,620
Ordering it to stop to save people
like holy Mount Goverdhan...

296
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:18,796
l don't think the smoke isn't
from your cigar.

297
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,961
lt looks like someone's
house is burnt!

298
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:23,630
This isn't smoke but my jealousy!

299
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:26,436
Has any new money lender come
here offering low interest?

300
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:31,445
Not interest, people are hailing
Baba, who roams with a stick.

301
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:33,981
l'm also carrying a stick,
but why don't people hail me?

302
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:36,985
What should we do to make
people hail us?

303
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:38,315
That's all?

304
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:41,448
People are praising Baba
when he just walks past!

305
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:47,461
lf you buy a good horse...
- Riding on it.- lf you go past!

306
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:50,657
When people of the village see it...

307
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:55,837
Hail Bhatia!

308
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:59,238
Then, we've to buy a good horse!

309
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:16,683
Did you call me, Baba?

310
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:20,353
l'm hungry,
can you get me chapattis please?

311
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:22,193
Are you hungry, Baba?

312
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:25,597
l'll go home and
make chapattis for you.

313
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:50,718
Baba, l've brought chapattis for you.
Take this.

314
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:26,257
l made those chapattis for you, Baba.

315
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,761
Why did you give it to the dog?

316
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,934
What did l tell you, Lakshmi Bai?
- You said you were hungry.

317
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:35,265
l can talk so l asked you.

318
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,930
lt can't talk so didn't ask you.

319
00:41:39,777 --> 00:41:42,575
lf it's hunger is satiated,
my hunger too is satiated.

320
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:47,278
Look at the eyes of the dog!
How gratefully it is looking at you!

321
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:57,291
ln God's creations animals too were
given the same hunger a humans,

322
00:41:57,795 --> 00:42:00,958
but the knowledge he gave to
humans was denied to animals.

323
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:03,956
You enlightened me from
my ignorance, Baba!

324
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:09,971
Not just your ignorance but this fire
will enlighten all the ignorant.

325
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,970
Who is he?
Where did he come from?

326
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:16,807
The beggar who came here...

327
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:22,316
One who begs to live,
how can he liberate you?

328
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:27,150
He's a cheat, trickster, sorcerer...

329
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:31,621
No, he's just a man!

330
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,991
l'll prove it...

331
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:36,159
l'll prove it...

332
00:42:37,168 --> 00:42:41,628
l'll open the eyes of people...

333
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,399
Kashiram sent this with great love.

334
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:47,636
Let's call it as Shamakarmi.

335
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:52,009
Take care of it from now.
- Okay Baba.

336
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,408
Come, Shamakarmi.

337
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:58,645
l'm Nanavali!

338
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:02,184
l know.

339
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:05,192
You know but still sitting?
Get up!

340
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:14,360
Who do you think he is, Nanavali?

341
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:16,670
l'm here to know it.

342
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:19,035
Are you in sense to say that?
- How dare!

343
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,678
No need to be brave to seek truth!

344
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:24,875
One needs to be brave
to tell the truth.- Are you mad?

345
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:25,879
You'll lose eyes!

346
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,383
He wants to ask something,
please let him ask.

347
00:43:30,688 --> 00:43:32,451
Are you God?

348
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:34,546
Who said so?

349
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:38,221
When l came here,
some called me Sai Baba,

350
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,221
some called me a Fakir,

351
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:44,697
people who got treated by me
called me a doctor,

352
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:47,568
now you say God!

353
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:52,471
God is one!

354
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:59,482
lf God is one, why do we've
different names as Rama and Krishna?

355
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:06,245
What is this?

356
00:44:06,924 --> 00:44:07,720
Water!

357
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:10,086
ln Telugu it is 'Neellu'.

358
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:12,084
ln Tamil it is 'Thanneeru'.

359
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:13,594
ln Kannada it is 'Neeru'.

360
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:14,925
ln Hindi it is 'Paani'.

361
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:16,430
ln Malayalam it is 'Vellam'.

362
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:19,095
ln English it is 'Water'.

363
00:44:19,937 --> 00:44:22,735
Though it called by different names,
it is the same thing, right?

364
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:25,431
God too like that only!

365
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:28,442
Trying to escape with
an intelligent answer.

366
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:30,944
Answer my questions directly,

367
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:32,742
what is faster than wind?
- Mind!

368
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,440
What is faster than mind?
- Thought!

369
00:44:34,618 --> 00:44:36,108
What's the animal with knowledge?
- Man!

370
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:37,447
What man shouldn't have?
- Ego!

371
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:38,610
What they should have?
- Affection!

372
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:39,950
Reason for sorrows?
- Desire.

373
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:41,955
What man should keep?
- Promise!

374
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:46,529
When would man be peaceful?
- After death!

375
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:54,295
Can't you believe it?
Doesn't it look like true?

376
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:58,870
As time passes people think
what follows them is age,

377
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:07,475
but what chases man is age,
selfishness, jealousy, avarice, desire.

378
00:45:08,152 --> 00:45:11,644
They don't leave man till he dies!

379
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:16,783
That's why l said man is peaceful
only after death

380
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:35,172
Great soul! You've told the
truth about life and death!

381
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:37,507
Did you ask these questions
thinking Baba wouldn't know it?

382
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:40,343
Nanavali didn't ask
because l don't know.

383
00:45:40,518 --> 00:45:43,180
lsn't it, Nanavali?
- Yes, Baba.

384
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:45,185
You're the supreme of all Yogis!

385
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:48,924
Though all of them believe you,
few still don't believe you!

386
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:52,360
l've come this far
to open their eyes.

387
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,520
Asked you so many questions.

388
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,190
Bye!

389
00:46:18,856 --> 00:46:21,381
l'll not get down.
- Get down.

390
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:25,051
Teacher Shyama says you're not
attending school regularly.

391
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:27,220
Get down!
You must go to the school.

392
00:46:27,398 --> 00:46:28,729
lf you ask me to go to school,
l'll jump down!

393
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:31,232
Don't threaten me!
You must go to school, that's it!

394
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:33,063
l'll jump!
- Get down!

395
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:34,226
l'll jump!

396
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:36,737
Please listen to me.
- Then, l'll jump!

397
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:45,079
Baba, you were in the mosque, right?
How did you come here?

398
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:51,748
l don't need vehicles for my travel!

399
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:59,261
You saved my son, Baba.
You're God to me, Baba.

400
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:03,426
No, you're my mother
who satiated my hunger.

401
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:05,898
You came in search of me
and offered food.

402
00:47:06,904 --> 00:47:09,270
You fed me fondly, my mother!

403
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:11,904
l've to repay your gratitude, right?

404
00:47:16,113 --> 00:47:21,016
Our bond is of 72 births old!

405
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,454
Will you go to school and
study as your mother says?

406
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:29,782
Say l'll study!

407
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:33,119
Allah will do you good!

408
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:50,311
l can see only animals here,
where are the people?

409
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:52,312
Who are you guys?

410
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:54,951
Are you here to buy or beg?

411
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:57,313
What's here to beg?
- Why not?

412
00:47:57,488 --> 00:48:01,822
Droppings of horses, pigs and chicken

413
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:04,393
Keep it with you and sell the animals!

414
00:48:06,497 --> 00:48:09,955
Your faces don't appear like buyers!
- How do they look then?

415
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:14,729
Like people who would take happily
even a camel's urine if given free!

416
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:17,663
No need anything free,
we want a good horse!

417
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:21,174
Why do you want a horse,
why not buy an elephant?

418
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:24,508
Why not buy a camel?
Why not buy a donkey?

419
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:26,172
We're here, right?
- You're right.

420
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:29,683
lf our boss rides on horse,
he'll look majestic!

421
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:32,185
Camel would be much more majestic!

422
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:36,349
Who would ride the horse among you?
- That's him!

423
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:38,688
Why doesn't he talk to me?
- Move!

424
00:48:38,862 --> 00:48:40,693
lf you tell the rate,
he'll talk to you.

425
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:43,697
l want to know a thing before that.
- What is it?

426
00:48:43,867 --> 00:48:47,701
Will you tie the horse outside
or inside the house?

427
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,203
Will you feed grass to it
or eat you too?

428
00:48:50,374 --> 00:48:52,001
What bothers you where
we keep after buying it!

429
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:55,007
You're wrong! Horse is my son!
- l mean like son!

430
00:48:55,212 --> 00:48:57,874
Camel is mother...
- like mother...

431
00:48:58,015 --> 00:49:02,384
Elephant is my father...like father...
- You're right!

432
00:49:02,553 --> 00:49:06,216
How much would he pay for the horse?
- 10 coins!

433
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:09,382
You'll get camel droppings!
- 20 coins!

434
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,394
You'll get goat's phlegm!
- 30 coins!

435
00:49:13,564 --> 00:49:16,032
You'll get a basket of chicken droppings!

436
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:18,224
You said so many things,
can l say one thing?

437
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:20,802
What's wrong with you if you can talk?

438
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:28,238
That one!

439
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:33,747
When you ride this horse!
- Added beauty to the horse!

440
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:36,249
But there's no one here to see it.
- Other than us!

441
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:42,752
Allah is God!

442
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:46,256
Guru!
- Look there!

443
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:52,429
Woman is taking bath!
- They may beat us!

444
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:54,594
Look there!

445
00:49:59,076 --> 00:50:02,273
Not Baba, let's prove he's a fake Baba!

446
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:05,779
Let's go to mosque, give him receipt
and send him out of Shiridi.

447
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:06,938
What a brain!

448
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:08,608
Can't say if he has or not
unless we remove the cap.

449
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:10,777
Shut up! Come...come...

450
00:50:10,954 --> 00:50:12,080
You'll be fine, mother.

451
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:14,082
Hey fakir!

452
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:17,787
Hey fakir! l'm calling you.

453
00:50:17,961 --> 00:50:20,293
How dare you call Baba as fakir!
You'll go blind!

454
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:23,297
l'll call him many more names!
He has charmed you all!

455
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:25,094
l'll prove he's a fake!

456
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:27,964
What will you prove?
We'll throw you out!

457
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:33,805
lf you understand his cheating,
you'll throw him out yourselves.

458
00:50:33,977 --> 00:50:35,808
Am l cheating them?

459
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:40,814
Other than this cloth and a begging
bowl, l don't have anything.

460
00:50:40,984 --> 00:50:44,476
Saying you've nothing,
made everyone believe you're God!

461
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:48,318
lf you really create magic,
why are you begging food then?

462
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:49,652
You can create it yourself, right?

463
00:50:49,827 --> 00:50:51,488
You can bring it from
thin air, right?

464
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:53,129
You can create vegetables too, right?

465
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,128
Why to beg?
Why to beg?

466
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,995
l'm begging to accept their sins.

467
00:50:59,837 --> 00:51:03,136
Did you hear?
All of you are sinners!

468
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,831
lt seems he's taking your sins!

469
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,139
You didn't get what l said, Bhatia!

470
00:51:11,014 --> 00:51:15,508
Every man would commit sins
wittingly or unwittingly,

471
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:19,520
While pounding paddy,
while sweeping homes, while cooking,

472
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:23,524
unwittingly he kills
many micro-organisms,

473
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:25,594
and commits sins!

474
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,691
l'll accept it as alms.

475
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:32,029
Give the fruits of good deed
of feeding the poor to them.

476
00:51:32,169 --> 00:51:34,535
ls feeding the poor
such a great deed?

477
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:39,369
Yes, eating the food you
have is nature!

478
00:51:39,543 --> 00:51:43,536
Plucking the food of others
to eat is against nature.

479
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:47,881
Giving the food you have
to others is culture!

480
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:51,885
Have you understood now
why Baba begs?

481
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:54,387
Know how great deed
is feeding the poor!

482
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:56,185
Learn to share your food
with others!

483
00:51:56,393 --> 00:51:57,553
Let's come to the point!

484
00:51:57,728 --> 00:52:00,060
Our boss has committed grave sins!

485
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:02,893
Why don't you beg from him?

486
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:05,398
He has done so many sins that
can't be washed away by my begging.

487
00:52:05,903 --> 00:52:09,737
Such a big man is riding
such a small horse!

488
00:52:10,073 --> 00:52:12,405
l think he's not feeding
it properly!

489
00:52:13,076 --> 00:52:16,307
His sins can be washed only
with punishment not with begging.

490
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:20,744
Baba is jealous that
you're riding on a horse!

491
00:52:20,918 --> 00:52:22,909
Boss, they're ignorant.

492
00:52:23,086 --> 00:52:24,576
lf you enter the village
riding this horse,

493
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:27,747
people would salute you!

494
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:29,222
Come...come...

495
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:31,326
How to get Baba to our way?

496
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:40,001
Why do we hear your words like barks?

497
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:45,606
Boss...dog!

498
00:52:59,122 --> 00:53:01,249
Horse is running away! Catch it!

499
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:02,948
How can we? lt ran away!

500
00:53:03,126 --> 00:53:05,788
Why did you say how?
- lt barked and jumped on you!

501
00:53:05,963 --> 00:53:08,454
Shut up! Come.

502
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,822
Stones thrown at him have turned
into flowers! Let's go!

503
00:53:41,164 --> 00:53:41,994
You...

504
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:53,670
Hit Baba with this stone!
lt'll wound him severely!

505
00:54:07,691 --> 00:54:08,521
Come Tatya!

506
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:14,323
l made a mistake,
please forgive me, Baba.

507
00:54:15,866 --> 00:54:19,529
Tell me...tell me...
- Please don't beat sir.

508
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:21,034
Where did you steal these jewels from?

509
00:54:21,204 --> 00:54:23,195
Please don't beat me, sir.
- Tell me...tell me l say!

510
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,864
Where did you steal these jewels from?

511
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:26,202
l'm telling you the truth!

512
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:28,208
Shiridi Sai Baba gave it to me!

513
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:33,214
Shiridi Sai or fake Baba!
Tell me the truth!

514
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:37,042
Revenue Officer!
He's not telling the truth!

515
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,553
Let's call that fake Baba,
we'll know the truth!

516
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:46,356
Don't say like that,
thousands pray Baba with love!

517
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:49,555
lt's not good to call here
a great man like him.

518
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:51,064
Let's go to him.

519
00:54:51,368 --> 00:54:53,233
Okay, let's settle it there!

520
00:55:04,915 --> 00:55:05,904
Greetings Baba!

521
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,745
My daughter struggling
with labour pain,

522
00:55:08,919 --> 00:55:11,581
you sent sacred ash with your
blessings to save mother and child.

523
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:14,087
l know you're God like man!

524
00:55:14,257 --> 00:55:16,748
But still l'm here to inquire
about a theft case.

525
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:18,918
What's the connection between
the theft and Baba?

526
00:55:19,096 --> 00:55:22,259
He's a thief, he claims that
fakir gave it to him.

527
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:27,759
Did he say like that?

528
00:55:27,938 --> 00:55:29,769
He did that's why l'm here to inquire.

529
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:34,274
lf he says l gave him,
it means l gave him, right?

530
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:36,777
Your clothes are worthless,

531
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:39,108
if you're sold nobody would
buy you for 25 paise too,

532
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:41,410
where did you get
so much ofjewellary?

533
00:55:41,952 --> 00:55:44,113
Hey police! Mind your words!

534
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:46,778
We'll not keep quiet
if you accuse Baba.
- What can you do?

535
00:55:46,957 --> 00:55:49,949
As you watch, shall l beat this
fake Baba to get the truth?

536
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:54,962
lf you dare touch out Baba, rivers of
blood would flow here. Be careful!

537
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:57,528
You won't go back!
- Let's see!

538
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:02,628
l'll inquire!
You calm down.

539
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:03,962
Your name?

540
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:08,971
For the sake of record! Can't avoid it!
Tell me!

541
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:12,142
l'm called as Sai Baba!

542
00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:14,143
Your father?

543
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:15,543
Sai Baba!

544
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,153
What? How can you and your father
have the same name?

545
00:56:20,323 --> 00:56:22,154
ls there any law forbidding it?

546
00:56:22,325 --> 00:56:24,657
Your Guru?
- Venkusa!

547
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:26,819
Your caste?
- Godliness!

548
00:56:26,997 --> 00:56:28,658
Your religion?
- Religion of Kabir.

549
00:56:28,832 --> 00:56:30,163
Your age?

550
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:37,568
Few lakhs of years!

551
00:56:39,843 --> 00:56:43,335
You're talking to ajudge,
you mustn't tell lies!

552
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:47,844
l never tell lies!

553
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:50,680
Did you see?
l wanted to settle in court,

554
00:56:50,854 --> 00:56:52,481
but you came here saying
he's a great man!

555
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:55,852
He claims Baba gave him,
Baba says he never tells lies!

556
00:56:56,026 --> 00:56:57,857
Where did you get these jewels from?

557
00:56:58,028 --> 00:56:58,494
Did God send it?

558
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:00,185
l gave him.
- l gave him!

559
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:16,701
l gave him.
- l gave him!

560
00:57:17,714 --> 00:57:23,516
Baba! Please forgive me!
l stole the jewels!

561
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,214
But people are taking the crime
on their heads for your sake.

562
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:35,529
l stole it from rich people coming
here for treatment of their beloveds.

563
00:57:37,734 --> 00:57:42,398
Sir, l committed the crime.
Punish me!

564
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:44,973
There's no better punishment
than repentance.

565
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:47,533
l'm releasing you as innocent.

566
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:53,079
Baba, please forgive me.

567
00:57:54,084 --> 00:57:56,075
Sir, you did your duty!

568
00:57:56,553 --> 00:57:59,249
But this police officer
went over the board!

569
00:57:59,422 --> 00:58:01,083
He insulted our God!

570
00:58:02,092 --> 00:58:03,252
He'll pay for it.

571
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:05,257
Fall at his feet seeking forgiveness.

572
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:20,766
Baba, l know only to take
thieves to jail!

573
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:23,344
But you know to convert
thieves into devotees!

574
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:27,109
l was harsh without knowing
your greatness.

575
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:30,283
l can't get rid of
this sin with my life!

576
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:38,291
To wash this sin, l need to
take a holy bath in Ganges.

577
00:58:39,796 --> 00:58:41,457
To take a dip in Ganges and Yamuna!

578
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:47,293
No need to go to Prayag
to take a holy dip!

579
00:58:47,971 --> 00:58:50,804
lf you make a wish, it'll come here!

580
00:59:24,341 --> 00:59:39,746
Hail supreme soul Sri Sainath!

581
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:49,765
Holy rivers Ganges and Yamuna
flowed from your divine feet...

582
00:59:51,534 --> 00:59:56,198
lt is love and grace
flowing on us...

583
01:00:07,884 --> 01:00:12,378
Any holy place or holy pond
to us is you Sai...

584
01:00:12,555 --> 01:00:17,390
Any life or thought is you...

585
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,894
You're omnipresent, Sai...

586
01:00:22,065 --> 01:00:26,399
This world is your Dwarakamai...

587
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:39,575
l don't bow to anyone else
other than Lord Rama. Please leave me.

588
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:42,708
Please listen to me,
make a visit to Baba!

589
01:00:42,919 --> 01:00:45,251
You'll know it!
Come.

590
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:47,720
Shiridi Baba is different
from fake Babas.

591
01:00:47,924 --> 01:00:49,414
l'm telling you, come.

592
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:58,265
You're God among humans...

593
01:00:58,435 --> 01:01:03,270
You appear like Lord Rama
of Kosala...

594
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:08,434
You've spread the message
of utmost devotion...

595
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:12,741
You appear like Lord Hanuman...

596
01:01:15,285 --> 01:01:19,619
You've showered your
divine mercy on us...

597
01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:24,853
You appear like Lord Shiva...

598
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:39,307
You're the oneness of
3 crores of Gods...

599
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:48,976
You're omnipresent
and omnipotent...

600
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:29,185
All are cows herded by you, Krishna...

601
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:34,023
Be my companion to show
the path, Krishna...

602
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:38,827
All are your devotees, Krishna...

603
01:02:39,035 --> 01:02:43,199
You're never ending love, Krishna...

604
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:54,841
Supreme lord of world...
Saviour of the universe...

605
01:02:55,718 --> 01:02:59,848
You're omnipresent Krishna...

606
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:04,720
You're omnipotent Krishna...

607
01:03:15,405 --> 01:03:17,396
Why did you stop?
Come, Sundari Bai!

608
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:19,731
How do you know my name?

609
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:22,233
Not just your name,

610
01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:26,576
l know why you are here
leaving Pandaripur.

611
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:30,746
You've charmed many with your talk.
Can't charm me!

612
01:03:30,887 --> 01:03:36,587
The place where Supreme soul
Krishna lives is Dwaraka,

613
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:38,090
why did you name this mosque after it?

614
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:40,752
Why do you call it as Dwarakamai?

615
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:41,761
Why do you think l did?

616
01:03:41,898 --> 01:03:44,765
Question can't be an answer to question.
- Then, listen.

617
01:03:45,435 --> 01:03:49,269
Dwaraka means place which has
doors on all four sides.

618
01:03:50,106 --> 01:03:52,904
Caste, religion, sub caste, race,

619
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:54,599
without bothering about all this,

620
01:03:54,777 --> 01:03:57,109
it means anyone can enter this place.

621
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:03,775
Whether it is mosque or
a temple or a church,

622
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,615
it is built with mud and stones, right?

623
01:04:05,788 --> 01:04:08,279
People who see it as mosque,
it is a mosque,

624
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:10,119
for those who see it as temple,
it is temple!

625
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:13,622
What's the doll in your hands?

626
01:04:14,297 --> 01:04:15,286
Radha and Krishna!

627
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:18,127
For ordinary people
it is just mud dolls.

628
01:04:18,468 --> 01:04:22,131
You see it with heart,
so you see Radha and Krishna.

629
01:04:22,472 --> 01:04:27,307
lf you see with faith,
you can see temple in this mosque,

630
01:04:27,477 --> 01:04:30,640
and see Krishna
in whom you've faith!

631
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:56,964
Please forgive me, Baba.

632
01:04:57,173 --> 01:05:00,665
From this moment Shiridi
is my Pandaripur!

633
01:05:00,843 --> 01:05:08,181
You pray Radha and Krishna, so l'll
call you as Radhakrishna Mai! Okay?

634
01:05:08,685 --> 01:05:09,845
l'm blessed!

635
01:05:15,692 --> 01:05:17,990
Why did you come back?

636
01:05:18,194 --> 01:05:21,994
You gave a lousy horse,
it humiliated me.

637
01:05:22,198 --> 01:05:26,191
lt didn't come on its own,
you ate its share of grass,

638
01:05:26,369 --> 01:05:28,701
it ran away getting angry on you!

639
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:31,863
l don't care about,
return the horse to me.

640
01:05:32,008 --> 01:05:33,999
lf it comes, take it.

641
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:36,701
lf it comes...
- You get on it.

642
01:05:36,879 --> 01:05:38,540
lt throws you down.
- You break your back.

643
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:41,707
lsn't this the reason that
has not made madam a mother?

644
01:05:41,884 --> 01:05:42,714
Why do we need it?

645
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:43,715
What shall we do then?

646
01:05:43,886 --> 01:05:45,444
Why don't you take the camel?

647
01:05:46,889 --> 01:05:48,550
Why should we take the camel?

648
01:05:48,725 --> 01:05:50,386
When others go in single bullock cart,

649
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,393
if you go camel,
it's like living one pillar fort!

650
01:05:53,563 --> 01:05:55,724
Just say yes.
- Say yes Guru!

651
01:05:55,898 --> 01:05:59,390
You can talk, right?
Why are you hesitating?

652
01:06:00,903 --> 01:06:04,134
He said yes!
Give the camel to him!

653
01:06:09,045 --> 01:06:13,243
Are you leaving me alone
here, O mother camel?

654
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:15,748
lf you face any difficulty there...

655
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:18,250
Earlier it was horse and
took time to come back.

656
01:06:18,421 --> 01:06:20,252
This is camel,
it may come back immediately.

657
01:06:20,423 --> 01:06:21,913
l beg you, let's go.

658
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:34,434
Who are you people?
What brings you here?

659
01:06:34,604 --> 01:06:38,267
They're from Shiridi!
All are devotees of Sai Baba!

660
01:06:40,777 --> 01:06:44,770
Baba is an incarnation of God!
- He's God to us!

661
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:49,081
l heard some fakir gives sacred ash!

662
01:06:51,954 --> 01:06:58,951
Devotees coming to Shiridi for
festival in 15 years have reached 75000.

663
01:06:59,095 --> 01:07:03,964
Baba has decided this year to
celebrate Ramanavami and Urs together.

664
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,624
They're here for your permission.

665
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:10,466
There's acute water problem everywhere.

666
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,973
With the grace of Baba,
when he put flowers into dried wells,

667
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:15,975
those wells filled with water!

668
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:38,566
Even salt water wells turned
into sweet drinking water.

669
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:43,332
Not only that, every year in the
festival of 'Chavidi',

670
01:07:43,506 --> 01:07:46,236
we take in a procession his
sandals and celebrate grandly!

671
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:57,852
Hail Sainath!

672
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:02,150
lf you grant them permission,
they'll celebrate Ramanavami and Urs!

673
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:05,020
l'm granting you permission.

674
01:08:05,695 --> 01:08:07,026
Do you want security?

675
01:08:07,163 --> 01:08:11,691
Baba's grace is our security!
Bye sir!

676
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:21,866
Mother...mother...

677
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:23,875
Why are you so happy?

678
01:08:24,046 --> 01:08:26,879
Baba has given me the responsibility
of Ramanavami celebrations.

679
01:08:27,049 --> 01:08:31,713
He said, nephew, take charge
of the celebrations!- ls it?

680
01:08:33,055 --> 01:08:37,185
Don't be happy for it,
do it with utmost devotion!

681
01:08:37,393 --> 01:08:42,194
With Baba here in Shiridi,
many are getting work and food.

682
01:08:42,398 --> 01:08:44,730
lt has become a holy pilgrim place!

683
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:47,199
As a little boy,
l made fun of Baba ignorantly!

684
01:08:47,403 --> 01:08:50,304
lf Baba asks l'm ready to
give my life also, mother.

685
01:08:50,907 --> 01:08:52,067
That's enough!

686
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:55,735
He promises to look after
like his own life.

687
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:59,409
You're ready to sacrifice
your life for him.

688
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:03,210
Only he can understand the
relationship between you both.

689
01:09:03,419 --> 01:09:06,582
He said that our relationship
is 72 births old!

690
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:11,587
Hindus and Muslims have fallen
into a trance!

691
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:14,594
They've forgotten religion!
Fell into the charm of Baba!

692
01:09:14,764 --> 01:09:21,226
He's insulting Hindus and Muslims
by celebrating Navami and Urs together.

693
01:09:21,437 --> 01:09:23,598
That's why l've called you
from neighbouring villages.

694
01:09:23,773 --> 01:09:24,933
lf we leave it like this,

695
01:09:25,107 --> 01:09:27,439
Shankar Shastri would
become Shankar Khan,

696
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:30,238
Bismillah Khan would
become Bismillah Shastri!

697
01:09:30,446 --> 01:09:31,606
A new religion will take birth!

698
01:09:31,781 --> 01:09:34,944
Beard is beard!
- Tuft is tuft!

699
01:09:35,117 --> 01:09:36,948
How can both be same?

700
01:09:37,253 --> 01:09:40,245
l swear on my sacred mark,
we'll not let this happen.

701
01:09:40,456 --> 01:09:41,946
We'll not let them
celebrate Ramanavami!

702
01:09:42,124 --> 01:09:43,955
We'll not allow celebrating
Urs with Ramanavami!

703
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:48,790
We'll not let it happen!

704
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:13,282
Hail Lord Rama...
beauty is in chanting thy name...

705
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:50,191
Ramanavami tells the
essence of Rama's story...

706
01:10:59,869 --> 01:11:05,205
Entire village is celebrating...

707
01:11:09,879 --> 01:11:12,712
Sky too is dancing in joy...

708
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:39,373
Kausalya was blessed with son Rama
in the palace of Dasaratha...

709
01:11:42,578 --> 01:11:52,385
Dasarathi established world peace on
a mission with Sage Vishwamithra...

710
01:11:54,757 --> 01:12:04,098
Epitome of goodness turned stone
into woman with the dust of his feet...

711
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:09,101
Rama married Seetha breaking
the legendary bow of Lord Shiva...

712
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:31,619
You're Lord Shiva prayed
by Rama to us, Sai...

713
01:12:31,794 --> 01:12:56,449
Rama Sai...

714
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:21,474
Journey to Dandakaranya tells the
value given to father's words...

715
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:33,680
Rama's journey took a turn
with the magic Deer...

716
01:13:36,025 --> 01:13:45,366
Rama crossed the sea by building a
bridge with the help of monkeys...

717
01:13:45,501 --> 01:13:51,030
Rama became king after wiping out
demon Ravana in a battle...

718
01:13:58,047 --> 01:14:05,886
You're Rama...you're Krishna...
you're Ranga to us Sai...

719
01:14:08,057 --> 01:14:10,525
You're an abode of all Gods...

720
01:14:10,726 --> 01:14:12,887
You're Saint Guru Sai of Shiridi...

721
01:14:41,557 --> 01:14:42,751
Let's decide it once for
all today, come!

722
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:44,552
Stop it!

723
01:14:47,263 --> 01:14:50,755
They've stop singing long back.
- Shut up!

724
01:14:50,933 --> 01:14:54,926
Who is conducting Ramanavami
celebrations here?- We!

725
01:14:55,104 --> 01:14:56,264
Are you a Hindu?
- Yes.

726
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:59,271
Will you dance in celebration with Urs?

727
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:00,430
Aren't you ashamed of being a Hindu?

728
01:15:00,576 --> 01:15:04,774
Not shame, we feel proud of
celebrating it with Urs!

729
01:15:04,947 --> 01:15:07,279
What celebrating together?
Do you know this?

730
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:10,941
Hindus write from left to right,
Muslims write from right to left!

731
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:11,779
You're right!

732
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:14,286
Hindus sport moustache
and Muslims shave it!

733
01:15:14,456 --> 01:15:17,289
You're right!- Hindus shave beard
and Muslims sport it.

734
01:15:17,459 --> 01:15:18,448
You're right!

735
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:20,960
Hindus and Muslims have
different customs.

736
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:22,791
Why to discuss with them?
Beat them!

737
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:24,458
Stop!

738
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:31,963
Hindus and Muslims are living
peaceful in Shiridi as brothers!

739
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:36,305
Are you trying to create
differences coming from outside?

740
01:15:36,478 --> 01:15:39,811
First decide who you are!
Are you a Hindu or Muslim?

741
01:15:39,982 --> 01:15:43,145
l'm a Hindu to Hindus and
a Muslim to Muslims!

742
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:45,480
No need to talk to them,
just say yes,

743
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:47,816
we'll throw them out of this place.

744
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:51,323
You came here to do something,
they're angry but you're silent.

745
01:15:51,493 --> 01:15:54,155
Beat them!

746
01:16:12,514 --> 01:16:15,642
Stop!

747
01:16:16,852 --> 01:16:20,344
Bhatia! Are Hindus and Muslims different?

748
01:16:20,522 --> 01:16:22,353
He's Abdullah, a Muslim!

749
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:25,857
He's Hindu!
Both are wounded!

750
01:16:27,196 --> 01:16:31,656
Find which blood belongs to Hindu
and which blood belongs to Muslim?

751
01:16:34,036 --> 01:16:38,439
Air we breathe and water we drink
has no religion!

752
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,532
Earth into which we go after death
too has no religion.

753
01:16:42,544 --> 01:16:46,446
Death is beyond religion,
why do you want it to live?

754
01:16:47,883 --> 01:16:54,686
My wish is that Shiridi must become a
role model to world not just to lndia.

755
01:16:55,891 --> 01:16:59,452
There must be only one holy
pilgrim place to all religions.

756
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:03,456
My dream is that Shiridi
becomes that place.

757
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:09,569
lf you think l'm bringing bad name,
l'm ready to leave Shiridi!

758
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:14,065
Don't do injustice to
your devotees, Baba!

759
01:17:14,243 --> 01:17:16,905
We don't want Shiridi without you!

760
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:19,908
No, please let me go!

761
01:17:37,599 --> 01:17:40,432
What happened to you?
Give him way!- Shut up!

762
01:17:40,602 --> 01:17:44,436
Baba, please forgive us listening
to this devil's words!

763
01:17:44,606 --> 01:17:47,734
You opened our eyes by teaching
man is important than religion.

764
01:17:47,943 --> 01:17:50,935
God is one! Your doctrine is true!

765
01:17:51,113 --> 01:17:54,105
May every village be blessed
with communal harmony like in Shiridi.

766
01:17:54,283 --> 01:17:58,276
Baba, we'll live together
like brothers hereafter!

767
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:12,758
Sai Baba!
- Hail Sai Baba!

768
01:18:12,968 --> 01:18:16,301
Sir, get on the camel,
that dog may chase you again.

769
01:18:16,638 --> 01:18:17,969
Get on!

770
01:18:24,146 --> 01:18:27,138
My plan went awry and
they joined his ranks!

771
01:18:29,651 --> 01:18:30,982
Don't say how!

772
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:35,149
Ride it faster!

773
01:18:35,324 --> 01:18:39,658
You're safe ion the camel,
we're on ground!

774
01:18:47,503 --> 01:18:50,165
Why do the flowers smell bad?

775
01:18:50,339 --> 01:18:53,001
Not from flowers,
it's emanating from boss.

776
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:58,502
What's this slush?
- Not slush but dung!

777
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,806
What happened to him?

778
01:19:00,015 --> 01:19:03,348
Hindus and Muslims were served food
as part of Ramanavami celebrations,

779
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:06,181
A big ditch was dug for
public convenience.

780
01:19:06,355 --> 01:19:09,188
Boss came on a camel and
fell into it.

781
01:19:09,358 --> 01:19:10,518
lt took an hour to take him out.

782
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:15,026
l told him not to trouble Baba,
that's why he got punished.- lndeed!

783
01:19:15,197 --> 01:19:20,191
Madam, though you're sporting flowers,
please sleep in the next room.

784
01:19:22,704 --> 01:19:27,198
ls it morning sickness madam?
- l think it's twins!- l'll beat you, boys!

785
01:19:29,378 --> 01:19:31,539
Hail Sai Baba!

786
01:19:33,215 --> 01:19:35,046
Hail Sai Baba!

787
01:19:41,723 --> 01:19:46,387
Not a soul other than us three
must know about this plan.

788
01:19:46,562 --> 01:19:49,224
Guru, camel is hearing you!

789
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:55,860
lt has long neck but small head!
What can it do anyway? Listen carefully!

790
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:59,563
At midnight as Shiridi is sleeping,

791
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:02,073
let's send Baba into
permanent resting place!

792
01:20:02,244 --> 01:20:07,739
Get men from outside,
cut Baba into pieces!

793
01:20:59,468 --> 01:21:17,649
What would've happened?

794
01:21:27,829 --> 01:21:29,160
This Baba...

795
01:21:46,515 --> 01:21:49,348
What we saw just now?
ls it true or dream?

796
01:21:49,518 --> 01:21:51,349
ls it imagination or hallucination?

797
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,182
We don't need knives any more.
- Keep it with you.

798
01:21:56,191 --> 01:22:00,525
lf we're seen with weapons,
people may think we'd killed Baba.

799
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:02,357
What shall we do now?

800
01:22:03,865 --> 01:22:05,992
Well! Shall we throw into it?
- Okay!

801
01:22:06,201 --> 01:22:07,691
Come...over!

802
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:11,866
Come!

803
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:18,710
Have you come?
Did you cut Baba into pieces?

804
01:22:19,715 --> 01:22:20,704
Why don't you answer me?

805
01:22:20,882 --> 01:22:24,010
Give me the good news of killing Baba.
l'm tensed!

806
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:29,885
Baba is cut into pieces!
- Great!

807
01:22:30,025 --> 01:22:33,392
Good riddance of misfortune!
l'm unchallenged!

808
01:22:33,562 --> 01:22:38,727
Sir, it is true that Baba is dead!
But we didn't kill him!

809
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:40,561
Not you?
- No!

810
01:22:40,736 --> 01:22:45,400
When we went Baba was found
cut into pieces.- ls it?

811
01:22:45,574 --> 01:22:48,042
Who would've done it?
Let it be anyone!

812
01:22:48,243 --> 01:22:50,734
We wanted to get rid of him
and got rid of him!

813
01:22:50,912 --> 01:22:53,403
We must be celebrating,
why are you feeling sad?

814
01:22:53,582 --> 01:22:56,050
We're worried about you sir.

815
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:59,243
You're the only enemy Baba
has in Shiridi!

816
01:22:59,421 --> 01:23:02,049
lf people inquire
who would've done it,

817
01:23:02,257 --> 01:23:03,747
you'd be their first suspect!

818
01:23:03,925 --> 01:23:06,587
l'm sure entire village would
come with weapons!

819
01:23:06,762 --> 01:23:09,253
l'm sure they'll haul us!
- l'm sure police would come.

820
01:23:09,431 --> 01:23:12,764
l'm sure you'd be hanged!
- l'm sure madam would become a widow.

821
01:23:12,934 --> 01:23:13,923
Stop it boys!

822
01:23:16,071 --> 01:23:21,600
Throw the weapons somewhere if
you don't people to suspect me.

823
01:23:21,777 --> 01:23:24,075
No more knives!

824
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:29,444
We got scared and threw into well!
- Donkeys!

825
01:23:30,452 --> 01:23:31,851
What should we do now?

826
01:23:32,087 --> 01:23:34,783
Did anyone see you going
to Baba's mosque?

827
01:23:38,794 --> 01:23:39,852
Nanavali saw us!

828
01:23:40,462 --> 01:23:41,793
Come!

829
01:23:41,963 --> 01:23:50,632
Sai is everywhere...
- He's coming!

830
01:23:53,475 --> 01:23:55,636
What are you doing at this hour?

831
01:23:55,811 --> 01:24:00,475
We're answering calls of nature.
lt has no time!

832
01:24:00,649 --> 01:24:01,479
Why are they with you?

833
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,312
Ghosts roam at night, right?

834
01:24:04,486 --> 01:24:06,113
We're taking demons to keep them off.

835
01:24:07,322 --> 01:24:09,984
No, we'll control it for tonight.
Come boys!

836
01:24:10,992 --> 01:24:12,323
We got the mad man!

837
01:24:12,494 --> 01:24:14,485
He himself doesn't know what he does!

838
01:24:14,663 --> 01:24:18,497
Fools! Make people believe
that he killed Baba.

839
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:20,498
l'll give whatever you ask!

840
01:24:22,337 --> 01:24:24,498
They've hacked Baba!
- They've killed Baba!

841
01:24:24,673 --> 01:24:34,514
They've hacked Baba!

842
01:24:38,687 --> 01:24:40,917
They've hacked Baba!

843
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:08,946
What have you done, Nanavali!
- Don't feel sad. Let's take him to task.

844
01:25:11,887 --> 01:25:14,549
Okay...okay...
- l'm telling you to calm down.

845
01:25:17,392 --> 01:25:21,726
How am to see you hacked to pieces?
- l can't see it!

846
01:25:21,897 --> 01:25:25,890
Please blindfold me!
- How can you see then?

847
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:30,197
l'll touch with hands and see!
Roll it!

848
01:25:36,077 --> 01:25:38,068
l can't see!
- Please open your eyes and see!

849
01:25:39,414 --> 01:25:42,906
l'm Nanavali asking you to see!

850
01:26:06,241 --> 01:26:10,439
How did he get down without a ladder?
- Steps are there for him in air!

851
01:26:10,612 --> 01:26:13,604
Hail Sai Baba!

852
01:26:14,616 --> 01:26:18,609
Are you worried that your
wish hasn't come true?

853
01:26:20,455 --> 01:26:21,786
At least now open your eyes!

854
01:26:21,957 --> 01:26:25,256
Fools! You said Baba was
hacked into pieces!

855
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:29,453
Fool! Baba is great Sage
amongst sages!

856
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:31,622
Great Yogi amongst Yogis!

857
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,461
Great Guru of Gurus!

858
01:26:33,802 --> 01:26:35,793
Great saint amongst saints!

859
01:26:35,971 --> 01:26:39,805
Baba knows 'Khandayoga' which
very few in this world know.

860
01:26:39,975 --> 01:26:43,638
He can dismantle parts of the body!
Rejoin it again!

861
01:26:43,812 --> 01:26:47,043
That happened last night!

862
01:26:47,482 --> 01:26:51,475
l'm confused!
What's this dismantling and rejoining?

863
01:26:51,653 --> 01:26:56,647
lf we're hungry,
we can eat food to satiate it.

864
01:26:56,825 --> 01:26:59,988
lf we're sick, we can take
medicine to get well.

865
01:27:00,662 --> 01:27:04,496
Enmity in one's heart can
be wiped with love!

866
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:07,157
Didn't you get me?

867
01:27:07,302 --> 01:27:09,395
Come, let's go before anything happens.

868
01:27:09,671 --> 01:27:12,834
No use anymore.
We must see the end of Baba.

869
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:19,669
Stop saying how or else
the dog will bite you! Let's go!

870
01:27:19,848 --> 01:27:21,315
Not this side, go that side.

871
01:27:53,214 --> 01:27:56,342
l'm tired shedding
crocodile tears there.

872
01:27:56,551 --> 01:27:58,883
l'm terribly hungry,
make hot chapattis for me.

873
01:27:59,054 --> 01:28:01,887
Chapattis? Hot chapattis?
Look there!

874
01:28:12,567 --> 01:28:15,900
Why is the house shabby like a shandy?

875
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:20,371
You brought horses and camels
where children should be playing!

876
01:28:24,579 --> 01:28:30,381
l told you camel is hearing us.
- You brushed it aside.

877
01:28:30,585 --> 01:28:34,077
We advised against hurting Baba.
lt has taken revenge.

878
01:28:34,255 --> 01:28:37,918
Let's buy a big elephant this time.

879
01:28:38,093 --> 01:28:41,392
Either it'll keep its trunk
or bow to madam.

880
01:28:41,596 --> 01:28:42,585
l'll kill you, fools!

881
01:28:42,764 --> 01:28:45,927
All the money is lost to
feed horse and camel.

882
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:50,770
lf you buy an elephant, to feed it
your boss may sell me also.

883
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:05,613
Were you using this brick
as pillow all these days, Baba?

884
01:29:05,787 --> 01:29:08,278
Had you asked us, we would've
brought silk cotton pillow, right?

885
01:29:10,425 --> 01:29:13,121
What's that blood mark on the brick?

886
01:29:14,429 --> 01:29:17,193
This is not a brick, it's my life!

887
01:29:17,799 --> 01:29:20,131
lt is drenched with the
blood of my Guru Venkusa!

888
01:29:20,301 --> 01:29:23,634
Blood of your Guru? How?

889
01:29:33,148 --> 01:29:36,982
l and few others were
disciples of my Guru!

890
01:29:37,819 --> 01:29:42,449
Feeling l was more dedicated and
intelligent than others,

891
01:29:42,657 --> 01:29:45,558
he took personal interest
to impart knowledge to me.

892
01:29:46,995 --> 01:29:50,453
He used to take special care
day and night!

893
01:29:50,999 --> 01:29:54,662
Taught me the essence of holy
Upanishads, secrets of Vedas,

894
01:29:54,836 --> 01:29:57,828
and kernel of holy scripts,

895
01:29:58,006 --> 01:30:04,343
Unable to bear this, a disciple
tried to hit me with brick.

896
01:30:07,849 --> 01:30:08,679
Son!

897
01:30:10,685 --> 01:30:11,674
Guru!

898
01:30:12,487 --> 01:30:13,351
Guru!

899
01:30:14,689 --> 01:30:17,487
Son, don't feel sad for me.

900
01:30:21,696 --> 01:30:25,860
This is not an ordinary brick.
lt is drenched with my blood.

901
01:30:26,034 --> 01:30:28,696
From now, this is your life!

902
01:30:29,704 --> 01:30:34,038
lf this brick is broken,
it means you're no more!

903
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:36,608
Take it!

904
01:30:37,212 --> 01:30:38,611
May God bless you long life!

905
01:30:40,048 --> 01:30:44,041
lf this brick is broken,
it means l'm no more!

906
01:30:47,889 --> 01:30:49,720
Please forgive me, Baba.

907
01:30:49,891 --> 01:30:54,055
lt happened while arranging your bed.
What if anything had happened to you!

908
01:30:54,529 --> 01:30:57,521
lt was not your mistake.

909
01:30:58,066 --> 01:31:01,900
God sends signals like this.

910
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:04,231
What is the signal for, Baba?

911
01:31:04,405 --> 01:31:07,238
lf anything happens to you,
can we bear it, Baba?

912
01:31:07,408 --> 01:31:11,902
Not just we, millions of your
devotees' hearts would stop.

913
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,742
Don't worry, nothing has
happened yet, right?

914
01:31:14,916 --> 01:31:19,250
Hereafter keep an eye on the
brick while cleaning the bed.

915
01:31:20,088 --> 01:31:24,422
You said this is your life,
you're our life!

916
01:31:24,759 --> 01:31:28,559
We'll take care of it
more than our lives!

917
01:31:29,931 --> 01:31:33,765
God is one!
He'll take care of everything!

918
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:40,571
Move...move...
- Go fast!

919
01:31:40,775 --> 01:31:44,267
Stop...stop...

920
01:31:44,779 --> 01:31:46,940
l feel your face is familiar!

921
01:31:47,115 --> 01:31:50,949
Your name is some Bhutia
or Ghutia, right?

922
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:53,952
lt's long time my mother camel
and son horse are dead.

923
01:31:54,122 --> 01:31:56,955
but these donkeys are still with you!

924
01:31:57,125 --> 01:31:59,593
What's this new vehicle?

925
01:31:59,794 --> 01:32:00,954
Lost faith in animals.

926
01:32:01,129 --> 01:32:02,790
So, trusting us,
he bought this vehicle.

927
01:32:02,964 --> 01:32:05,455
They're drowning you!
- Did we?

928
01:32:06,134 --> 01:32:07,965
You've lost mind not cough.

929
01:32:08,136 --> 01:32:11,469
lt's your boss who has lost his mind.

930
01:32:12,473 --> 01:32:14,600
You're paying him for
pulling the rickshaw,

931
01:32:14,809 --> 01:32:16,970
you're paying them
for riding on it.

932
01:32:18,146 --> 01:32:20,307
Do you know what l would've done?
- What would you've done?

933
01:32:20,481 --> 01:32:24,315
l would've fired him and made
these two fools to pull it,

934
01:32:24,485 --> 01:32:28,319
l would've saved his salary!
- Can't l do that?

935
01:32:28,489 --> 01:32:30,821
Hey you're fired!
You pull the rickshaw!

936
01:32:30,992 --> 01:32:36,624
Now it is fine, pull it boys!
- Pull the rickshaw!

937
01:33:04,025 --> 01:33:06,858
Call Mhalsapathi and
others immediately.

938
01:33:29,884 --> 01:33:32,546
Why did you call us urgently, Baba?

939
01:33:37,892 --> 01:33:39,223
What happened, Baba?

940
01:33:40,895 --> 01:33:43,693
l got a call from God!

941
01:33:45,566 --> 01:33:47,056
Are you testing us, Baba?

942
01:33:47,235 --> 01:33:50,398
How can God call you, Baba?
You're a God, right?

943
01:33:52,707 --> 01:33:55,073
l'm just God's representative!

944
01:33:56,244 --> 01:33:58,235
l'll come back in 3 days!

945
01:33:58,413 --> 01:34:00,074
Will you come back in 3 days?

946
01:34:00,248 --> 01:34:02,079
Did it ever happen in history?

947
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:04,718
Baba, don't say anything to
leave our hearts ceased.

948
01:34:04,919 --> 01:34:07,410
Yesterday you talked
about some signal,

949
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:12,082
now you say you'll meet God
and come back in 3 days.

950
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:14,728
How is it possible?

951
01:34:14,929 --> 01:34:18,421
Though my soul goes,
my earthly body stays here only!

952
01:34:19,434 --> 01:34:23,268
Look after my body safely.

953
01:34:24,939 --> 01:34:29,740
Baba, we can't understand
what you're saying!

954
01:34:34,115 --> 01:34:38,745
Time is running out,
listen carefully.

955
01:34:41,622 --> 01:34:47,959
For 3 days my heart will cease,
my pulse would stop.

956
01:34:51,766 --> 01:34:53,290
l'll not breathe!

957
01:34:55,303 --> 01:34:59,865
lf God doesn't permit me
to come back.

958
01:35:01,776 --> 01:35:06,975
Please don't say like that, Baba.
We're orphans without you.

959
01:35:07,315 --> 01:35:11,149
Your path is our way!
We'll also give up life for you!

960
01:35:11,319 --> 01:35:12,786
We will!

961
01:35:12,987 --> 01:35:15,649
You're wrong!
Don't talk like that.

962
01:35:16,991 --> 01:35:22,486
God send every life with
a decided lifespan!

963
01:35:27,335 --> 01:35:31,499
lf l don't come back,

964
01:35:32,807 --> 01:35:39,007
dig a grave there and bury my body!

965
01:35:45,019 --> 01:35:57,193
Put saffron flag for Hindus and
green flag for Muslims on my grave.

966
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,031
You're travelling outside,

967
01:36:08,209 --> 01:36:10,541
many incidents are happening
in our place.- What is it?

968
01:36:10,711 --> 01:36:12,542
Good news for you.
- What?

969
01:36:12,713 --> 01:36:14,704
Baba is dead and gone.
- Dead?

970
01:36:15,049 --> 01:36:16,539
Then, distribute sweets
to everyone.

971
01:36:16,717 --> 01:36:18,207
But it seems he'll come back.

972
01:36:18,386 --> 01:36:20,377
How can the dead come back, you fool!

973
01:36:20,555 --> 01:36:23,547
lt seems Baba himself has told
that he'd come back in 3 days.

974
01:36:23,724 --> 01:36:26,056
People are waiting with the corpse.

975
01:36:26,227 --> 01:36:28,218
Then, we must inform this
to the Collector.

976
01:36:28,396 --> 01:36:29,863
Don't know what you tell him or how,

977
01:36:30,064 --> 01:36:33,397
but people are singing devotional
songs keeping the body.

978
01:36:38,739 --> 01:36:44,234
Sai means mother...

979
01:36:44,579 --> 01:36:48,743
Baba means father...

980
01:36:49,884 --> 01:36:56,414
Without Sai Baba...

981
01:36:57,892 --> 01:37:03,262
We've become orphans
without mother and father...

982
01:37:03,431 --> 01:37:09,267
We've become wingless birds...

983
01:37:09,437 --> 01:37:13,771
With the hope that
you'd come back...

984
01:37:13,908 --> 01:37:18,106
With the hope that you'd
come back alive...

985
01:37:18,279 --> 01:37:29,918
We're like stars eagerly
waiting for moon...

986
01:37:30,124 --> 01:37:34,117
We've become drops of tears...

987
01:38:11,832 --> 01:38:17,327
Who would teach us...
Who would share our sorrows...

988
01:38:17,505 --> 01:38:23,341
Who would show divine ploys...
Who would play marbles with us...

989
01:38:34,522 --> 01:38:44,523
Who would sing with us...
Who would correct our mistakes...

990
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:56,702
Who would gently point us out...
Who would share love later...

991
01:38:56,877 --> 01:39:05,376
Sai,...

992
01:39:05,553 --> 01:39:11,890
you give us life,
have you gone lifeless yourself?

993
01:39:13,894 --> 01:39:21,562
We'll not rest till you come back...

994
01:40:07,948 --> 01:40:14,786
Sacred ash you gave us,
we'll apply it to you...

995
01:40:14,955 --> 01:40:20,450
Wake up Sai...

996
01:40:20,628 --> 01:40:27,090
We'll wake you up with the
stick you carry...

997
01:40:27,301 --> 01:40:33,103
Wake up Baba...

998
01:40:33,307 --> 01:40:44,479
Till now you begged and
took our pain...

999
01:40:44,652 --> 01:40:52,821
Today we're begging to give
back your life as alms...

1000
01:40:52,993 --> 01:40:58,329
We can't wait till it is given...

1001
01:40:58,499 --> 01:41:06,497
We'll not keep quiet
till you come back...

1002
01:41:06,674 --> 01:41:13,011
We'll not have a drop of water too...

1003
01:41:42,877 --> 01:41:47,712
Check if Sai Baba is dead or alive.

1004
01:42:13,407 --> 01:42:16,740
No...no...Baba promised
to come back in 72 hours.

1005
01:42:16,911 --> 01:42:18,742
That time hasn't elapsed yet.

1006
01:42:18,913 --> 01:42:21,746
Baba isn't back in 71 hours
and 45 minutes.

1007
01:42:21,916 --> 01:42:23,747
Can he come back alive
in 15 minutes?

1008
01:42:31,926 --> 01:42:33,086
Dig a grave! Let's bury him!

1009
01:42:33,227 --> 01:42:35,923
Won't you honour our faith, Collector?

1010
01:42:36,096 --> 01:42:37,222
Won't you care about our beliefs?

1011
01:42:37,431 --> 01:42:40,594
Body will decay if you delay.

1012
01:42:40,768 --> 01:42:44,101
Plague is rampant everywhere.

1013
01:42:45,606 --> 01:42:48,939
No, if Baba says, it'll happen.

1014
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:52,772
He's no ordinary man, he's a
great soul! He'll definitely come.

1015
01:42:52,947 --> 01:42:55,780
We've faith,
he'll definitely come.

1016
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:59,943
Collector, if you listen to them,
nobody would survive here.

1017
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:04,614
Everyone would die with plague.
Get the grave ready, fast!

1018
01:44:08,322 --> 01:44:14,522
Hail Great Guru Sainath!

1019
01:44:20,534 --> 01:44:26,700
A dead man coming back to life
after 3 days in this world...

1020
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:28,872
First time!

1021
01:44:54,368 --> 01:44:55,892
Understood it?

1022
01:44:58,072 --> 01:44:59,903
lt isn't anyone's mistake.

1023
01:45:00,574 --> 01:45:04,738
Time will clear doubts.
lt'll give answers.

1024
01:45:04,912 --> 01:45:06,072
You may go now.

1025
01:45:07,081 --> 01:45:08,241
We'll take leave Baba.

1026
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:14,744
lt's good if you do one thing.
Go and fall at Baba's feet!

1027
01:45:15,255 --> 01:45:18,918
Massage his legs, if not
you'll be buried in the grave.

1028
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:22,751
l'll show you after getting
into the vehicle.- Come.

1029
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:24,261
How could Baba come back alive?

1030
01:45:24,398 --> 01:45:26,764
Don't say how?
Dog will come after us!

1031
01:45:27,768 --> 01:45:29,759
lt has come!
- Pull faster!

1032
01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:33,262
We're not connected to this.

1033
01:45:33,941 --> 01:45:35,932
Go...go...

1034
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:37,600
Why are you beating us
if dog chases you?

1035
01:45:38,946 --> 01:45:40,106
We can't...
- lt caught us!

1036
01:45:42,616 --> 01:45:47,110
Guru!- My leg!...

1037
01:45:47,621 --> 01:45:48,781
Lift him!

1038
01:45:49,423 --> 01:45:51,118
Have you broken your leg?

1039
01:45:53,293 --> 01:45:55,955
Dog!
- Lift me up!

1040
01:45:58,298 --> 01:45:59,629
Please bear it.
- Fan me!

1041
01:46:01,301 --> 01:46:02,529
Take porridge.

1042
01:46:04,972 --> 01:46:07,805
Oh no, l hate to have porridge.

1043
01:46:07,975 --> 01:46:10,808
Then, think about Baba.
You'll get well soon.

1044
01:46:10,978 --> 01:46:14,311
lf you talk about Baba,
l'll throw this porridge on you!

1045
01:46:14,448 --> 01:46:15,642
That's why you got hurt.

1046
01:46:15,816 --> 01:46:18,649
Please send some milk for us.
We'll have it.

1047
01:46:18,819 --> 01:46:20,309
l'll kill you.
You apply!

1048
01:46:20,454 --> 01:46:21,978
You fan!
- You have it.

1049
01:46:36,670 --> 01:46:46,477
Where are you?
Where are you, Sai?

1050
01:46:52,853 --> 01:46:59,019
Show up before me for
the last glimpse...

1051
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:13,868
Let my soul merge with you...

1052
01:47:24,218 --> 01:47:30,714
This is enough for this life...

1053
01:47:32,726 --> 01:47:37,891
Let me breathe my last in your lap...

1054
01:47:38,065 --> 01:47:39,054
Mother!

1055
01:47:50,077 --> 01:47:54,537
My mother died as l watched,
how am l to live, Baba?

1056
01:47:54,915 --> 01:48:00,547
Life and death,
born again, die again,

1057
01:48:00,754 --> 01:48:03,746
this is life!
Understood it?

1058
01:48:03,924 --> 01:48:09,556
He's feeling orphaned, it's your
responsibility to wipe his tears.

1059
01:48:10,097 --> 01:48:13,089
You've to feed him.
- As you say Baba.

1060
01:48:13,767 --> 01:48:15,564
l'll take care of him like my son.

1061
01:48:24,778 --> 01:48:26,575
My damn fate l'm working with you.

1062
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:27,769
White dog!

1063
01:48:27,948 --> 01:48:29,779
White fox!
- White pig!

1064
01:48:30,284 --> 01:48:33,583
White pig!
ls yours a life?

1065
01:48:33,787 --> 01:48:35,948
Big moustache and majestic walk!

1066
01:48:36,123 --> 01:48:37,454
l'll beat you with slippers.

1067
01:48:40,594 --> 01:48:44,291
l've brought homemade
sweetmeats for you, sir.

1068
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:53,803
ls it to see or eat?
- To eat seeing.

1069
01:48:53,974 --> 01:48:56,602
What is this like a ball?

1070
01:48:57,611 --> 01:49:00,307
This is like a cycle wheel.

1071
01:49:00,614 --> 01:49:03,481
This is like a round table.

1072
01:49:04,151 --> 01:49:07,985
This is not a ball but 'Poornamu'!
Earth!

1073
01:49:08,822 --> 01:49:11,814
This is not cycle wheel but 'Garey'
Lord Vishnu's discuss.

1074
01:49:12,993 --> 01:49:14,984
This is 'Bobbattu' not round table.

1075
01:49:18,165 --> 01:49:20,998
Begging faith!

1076
01:49:21,168 --> 01:49:23,636
Sir, it is mad faith!

1077
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:32,642
With that mad faith people are
worshipping a beggar as God.

1078
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:40,643
Slaves who should be saluting us!

1079
01:49:40,854 --> 01:49:44,847
lt seems they're going after
a fakir and visiting a mosque.

1080
01:49:45,025 --> 01:49:47,357
He's not an ordinary man, sir.

1081
01:49:47,527 --> 01:49:50,655
People are seeing Rama and Krishna
in him for the past 20 odd years.

1082
01:49:50,864 --> 01:49:53,526
People are worshipping him!

1083
01:50:28,235 --> 01:50:30,396
How dare you talk to me
in English!

1084
01:50:30,570 --> 01:50:33,562
People believe he's God!

1085
01:50:34,408 --> 01:50:37,400
l didn't speak in English,
why did you slap me now?

1086
01:50:37,577 --> 01:50:41,240
Slapped for speaking Telugu
which l can't understand

1087
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:48,085
Aren't you hurt?
- l'm Baba's devotee.

1088
01:50:48,588 --> 01:50:51,716
Baba accepts the hurt
of his devotees.

1089
01:50:51,925 --> 01:50:56,726
When someone beat the horse
Baba loves so dearly!

1090
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,727
Mad faith!

1091
01:51:03,937 --> 01:51:06,929
Only an Englishman is great
in the world!

1092
01:51:07,107 --> 01:51:10,440
We found the train,
you're riding in it.

1093
01:51:10,610 --> 01:51:13,943
We found the airplane,
you're flying in it.

1094
01:51:14,114 --> 01:51:21,111
We found telephone, you're
talking nonsense for hours.

1095
01:51:21,288 --> 01:51:27,124
lndians intelligence is zero
compared to Englishmen.

1096
01:51:27,294 --> 01:51:32,459
lf you're smart, can you tell me
how could this jaggery get into this?

1097
01:51:32,632 --> 01:51:35,123
lt's a miracle!

1098
01:51:35,302 --> 01:51:40,968
You couldn't answer this and yet claim
to be intelligent and we're foolish.

1099
01:51:41,641 --> 01:51:44,132
That's why some people
think of you like this.

1100
01:51:44,311 --> 01:51:45,778
What do they think?

1101
01:51:45,979 --> 01:51:49,881
lf Baba decides,
you'd go back as you had come.

1102
01:51:50,150 --> 01:51:53,779
Loose tongues like me think so.
- What do you think?

1103
01:51:53,987 --> 01:51:57,787
That your flag would get ripped!
You can't even use it as loin...

1104
01:51:58,158 --> 01:51:59,989
Loose tongues like me think so.

1105
01:52:02,162 --> 01:52:10,661
Then, l must keep an eye on Baba!

1106
01:52:11,338 --> 01:52:23,341
Hail Sai! You're Krishna
and you're Rama...

1107
01:52:23,517 --> 01:52:24,814
Guests are coming.

1108
01:52:25,185 --> 01:52:25,810
Please come.

1109
01:52:28,688 --> 01:52:37,027
He's a freedom fighter fighting
for lndia's independence.- l know.

1110
01:52:38,031 --> 01:52:39,828
'Freedom is my birth right'
with that caption,

1111
01:52:40,033 --> 01:52:44,197
a man who is awakening lndia's
conscience Balagangadhar Tilak.

1112
01:52:46,373 --> 01:52:48,705
Would l achieve in my aim, Baba?

1113
01:52:49,709 --> 01:52:51,540
Would our country get freedom?

1114
01:52:51,711 --> 01:52:54,703
lt will but not now!

1115
01:53:14,568 --> 01:53:16,866
ln near future a great man
is about to come,

1116
01:53:18,071 --> 01:53:19,561
his name is Gandhi,

1117
01:53:20,574 --> 01:53:23,407
our country will get freedom
because of him.

1118
01:53:25,579 --> 01:53:28,571
Our national flag will
fly on Red Fort!

1119
01:53:36,590 --> 01:53:39,582
What my foot?

1120
01:53:39,759 --> 01:53:43,889
lt seems Baba has told Tilak
that lndia will get freedom.

1121
01:53:44,097 --> 01:53:45,894
Freedom is my birth right...

1122
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:51,669
Why do we need freedom, sir?

1123
01:53:53,106 --> 01:53:58,772
lt seems some freedom
fighter visited Baba.

1124
01:53:58,912 --> 01:54:02,439
lt seems he talked about freedom.

1125
01:54:02,916 --> 01:54:10,118
lt seems that fakir too
predicted lndia freedom.

1126
01:54:10,624 --> 01:54:20,124
That fakir is an extremist
in the garb of a beggar.

1127
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:24,134
l'll take his photo in black and white.

1128
01:54:24,304 --> 01:54:29,037
l'll prove if your Baba
is black or white.

1129
01:54:34,814 --> 01:54:35,644
Come!

1130
01:54:35,949 --> 01:54:40,318
Baba, you appeared in my dream and
permitting me to build a temple,

1131
01:54:40,487 --> 01:54:42,648
l consider it as my great fortune!

1132
01:54:42,822 --> 01:54:47,953
ln future lakhs of devotees
would visit this temple.

1133
01:54:48,495 --> 01:54:51,328
They'll offer prayers and
sing devotional songs every day!

1134
01:54:52,165 --> 01:54:55,328
This temple must be completed
before Vijayadasami.

1135
01:54:55,502 --> 01:54:58,164
Vijayadasami? Very auspicious day!

1136
01:55:00,507 --> 01:55:05,501
Everyone's path is decided
on the day of Dasami.

1137
01:55:11,851 --> 01:55:12,681
Please come, sir.

1138
01:55:16,690 --> 01:55:17,987
He's Baba!

1139
01:55:21,528 --> 01:55:26,761
Sir, let's take his permission.
He's a living God!

1140
01:55:28,868 --> 01:55:30,995
Permission to us?

1141
01:55:33,373 --> 01:55:35,364
l mean we're the rulers!

1142
01:55:35,542 --> 01:55:38,375
Sir, but he's Lord of Lords.

1143
01:55:39,879 --> 01:55:43,110
Only Jesus is the God of this world!

1144
01:55:57,230 --> 01:55:59,562
Why are these heads
coming in between?

1145
01:55:59,733 --> 01:56:02,224
To tell your head is
filled with mud.

1146
01:56:04,738 --> 01:56:08,230
May be they're here to tell not to
take photo without his permission.

1147
01:56:08,408 --> 01:56:10,899
We'll take.
- Go ahead!

1148
01:56:11,044 --> 01:56:13,569
Take and develop it.
- Then see it!

1149
01:56:13,913 --> 01:56:16,814
What would l get?
- May be it'll give a shock.

1150
01:56:28,428 --> 01:56:29,759
lt's done!

1151
01:56:48,782 --> 01:56:49,942
Why are you shouting?

1152
01:56:50,083 --> 01:56:51,778
l'm feeling giddy seeing
the photo you'd taken.

1153
01:56:51,951 --> 01:56:53,612
Don't know how you'd feel!

1154
01:57:06,299 --> 01:57:11,635
Don't go on say my foot, that's why,
Baba's holy feet are in your hands.

1155
01:57:11,805 --> 01:57:15,468
People shake hands in your country,
we prostrate at feet,

1156
01:57:15,642 --> 01:57:19,100
so stop saying my foot and
fall at Baba's feet!

1157
01:57:21,114 --> 01:57:23,105
There's some magic in this.

1158
01:57:23,316 --> 01:57:27,480
Not magic sir, we've an episode
about Vamana in our epics,

1159
01:57:27,654 --> 01:57:30,122
one foot on sky, one foot on earth,

1160
01:57:30,323 --> 01:57:32,120
a foot on your head!

1161
01:57:32,325 --> 01:57:36,659
History about God's feet is
not ordinary in this country.

1162
01:57:50,143 --> 01:58:00,018
Even great saints are liberated
by the lotus feet of Vishnu....

1163
01:58:02,522 --> 01:58:09,360
Untouched by bonds and ties...
shining as the universe...

1164
01:58:10,864 --> 01:58:14,857
Holiest of all feet is Vishnu's feet...

1165
01:58:17,036 --> 01:58:22,372
Holy feet of the supreme lord...

1166
01:58:31,384 --> 01:58:41,726
Vamana's holy feet scaled the
earth, sky and heaven...

1167
01:58:41,895 --> 01:58:52,203
Lord Shiva holy feet gave birth
to ever flowing Ganges...

1168
01:58:52,405 --> 01:59:02,212
Holy feet of Lord Rama created a
society of love and brotherhood...

1169
01:59:02,415 --> 01:59:06,579
These holy feet are the
lights of all directions...

1170
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:10,583
Holy feet are the epitome of mercy...

1171
01:59:10,757 --> 01:59:14,591
Seek refuge in holy feet of Vishnu...

1172
01:59:14,761 --> 01:59:18,754
Seek refuse in holy feet of Rama...

1173
01:59:18,932 --> 01:59:22,925
Seek refuge in holy feet of Krishna...

1174
01:59:23,102 --> 01:59:36,106
Seek refuse in holy feet of Sri Sai...

1175
01:59:43,957 --> 01:59:53,958
Holy feet that protect
the good from demon...

1176
01:59:54,133 --> 02:00:02,973
Holy feet that little Krishna danced
on the hood of giant snake Kalindi...

1177
02:00:04,477 --> 02:00:14,648
Holy feet that took on Kamsa and
others to protect Yadavas...

1178
02:00:14,821 --> 02:00:18,814
Holy feet of the Trinity...

1179
02:00:18,992 --> 02:00:23,292
The corner stone feet
of all Gods...

1180
02:01:01,534 --> 02:01:05,527
Baba, please forgive us.
- Allah will forgive you!

1181
02:01:06,706 --> 02:01:09,539
He's Lord Wales,
British Empire representative.

1182
02:01:09,709 --> 02:01:12,200
He took your photo without
your permission,

1183
02:01:12,345 --> 02:01:14,336
all he got was the full
size of your feet,

1184
02:01:14,547 --> 02:01:18,347
May be these feet would
become beacon of future!

1185
02:01:18,551 --> 02:01:25,719
Those feet mean people who follow
right path have good future.

1186
02:01:25,892 --> 02:01:30,352
l warned him not take photo
without Baba's permission.

1187
02:01:30,563 --> 02:01:33,225
At least now take his permission
and take his photo.

1188
02:01:55,755 --> 02:01:59,589
Are you worried that Baba
is speaking in English?

1189
02:02:01,761 --> 02:02:07,165
l must take Baba's photo and
send it to high command.

1190
02:02:48,307 --> 02:02:49,205
You fool!

1191
02:02:50,643 --> 02:02:54,443
What happened?
ls it feet again?
- No Lord!

1192
02:02:54,647 --> 02:02:57,980
Baba's full size image
is looking bright!

1193
02:03:37,857 --> 02:03:42,021
l committed sins saying my foot!

1194
02:03:44,030 --> 02:03:47,022
l want to touch your holy feet once!

1195
02:03:53,372 --> 02:03:59,277
You're Rama, you're Krishna,
you're Allah, and you're Jesus!

1196
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:15,891
Get up!

1197
02:04:18,898 --> 02:04:21,731
For giving me the permission
to photograph you,

1198
02:04:22,068 --> 02:04:24,400
please ask me anything
if l can do for you.

1199
02:04:24,537 --> 02:04:29,634
Make copies of this photo and
distribute it to everyone in Shiridi.

1200
02:04:30,076 --> 02:04:33,534
When you're with us,
do we need your photo, Baba?

1201
02:04:37,083 --> 02:04:40,075
Where ever l may be,
you'd see me.

1202
02:04:40,253 --> 02:04:42,244
l too must see you, right?

1203
02:04:43,556 --> 02:04:47,424
No need to come to Shiridi
to have a glimpse of me.

1204
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:51,252
ln which ever home has my photo,
l'm there only! Okay!

1205
02:04:51,430 --> 02:04:58,097
Hail Sainath!

1206
02:05:16,289 --> 02:05:19,781
How long do l've to go through this?
- Please bear it sir.

1207
02:05:19,959 --> 02:05:23,793
Please listen to me and
bow before Baba's photo.

1208
02:05:23,963 --> 02:05:24,952
Your leg pain will ease.

1209
02:05:25,131 --> 02:05:27,463
l'm unable to get up,
how can l walk to you?

1210
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:30,967
Have faith in Baba! Pray devotedly!

1211
02:05:31,137 --> 02:05:34,129
lf you're sincere in your prayers,
Baba will shower his mercy!

1212
02:06:19,185 --> 02:06:24,020
Baba, please forgive all my mistakes!

1213
02:06:24,190 --> 02:06:27,023
Bhatia, give me two rupees.

1214
02:06:27,193 --> 02:06:31,527
l'll give everything to temple,
why just Rs.2, Baba?

1215
02:06:33,366 --> 02:06:36,529
l asked your ego and
your ignorance!

1216
02:06:36,669 --> 02:06:39,763
ls that why you see Rs.2 from everyone?

1217
02:06:40,206 --> 02:06:44,040
lf you're not dedicated,
l'll take devotion and prayers.

1218
02:06:44,210 --> 02:06:47,543
From another person,
l'll take jealous and hatred.

1219
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:51,047
From few people
l'll take desire and anger.

1220
02:06:51,217 --> 02:06:58,385
Baba, consider us also as a rupee...
- Take our egos!

1221
02:06:58,557 --> 02:07:03,688
Remove ego form hearts
and live as humans.- Okay Baba.

1222
02:07:06,899 --> 02:07:10,062
Temple is very good.
- lt's also your grace, Baba.

1223
02:07:10,236 --> 02:07:12,397
ldol of Krishna too is getting ready.

1224
02:07:13,239 --> 02:07:18,700
Make a beautiful pedestal
there to install the idol.- Okay Baba.

1225
02:07:19,078 --> 02:07:24,914
No need for Shiva but
Krishna loves decorations.

1226
02:07:28,421 --> 02:07:29,410
What?

1227
02:07:29,588 --> 02:07:34,582
lf you permit me, l'll all over the
country to spread your message.

1228
02:07:35,594 --> 02:07:39,587
As you please!
Start now!

1229
02:07:47,606 --> 02:07:48,595
What is it, Baba?

1230
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:55,270
l felt like seeing you once again!

1231
02:08:17,136 --> 02:08:21,539
What's this? What happened?
What happened to you?

1232
02:08:21,974 --> 02:08:27,139
For God's sake please don't
tell this to Baba.

1233
02:08:28,647 --> 02:08:32,310
lf he knows, he may not bear it.
Baba won't bear it.

1234
02:08:53,672 --> 02:08:56,505
Tatya told you not to
tell me a thing, right?

1235
02:09:08,354 --> 02:09:11,517
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to Tatya.

1236
02:09:12,358 --> 02:09:17,193
lt's not just bond between us,
he's my responsibility too.

1237
02:09:19,532 --> 02:09:25,027
His mother, my sister Bhaija Bai.

1238
02:09:25,704 --> 02:09:30,368
Where ever l may be, she used
to come with food to feed me.

1239
02:09:32,545 --> 02:09:34,536
l must repay her gratitude, right?

1240
02:09:34,713 --> 02:09:39,377
l'll save his life with mine.

1241
02:10:04,076 --> 02:10:05,407
lt is broken!

1242
02:10:06,412 --> 02:10:10,405
Please forgive me, Baba!
l didn't do it wantonly.

1243
02:10:11,417 --> 02:10:13,578
lt's not your mistake.

1244
02:10:15,754 --> 02:10:17,415
One has become two!

1245
02:10:19,258 --> 02:10:23,752
Body and soul are different, right?

1246
02:10:24,430 --> 02:10:30,096
Baba, don't say like that.
Abdullah broke it by mistake.

1247
02:10:30,903 --> 02:10:36,000
lt isn't Abdullah's work but God's!

1248
02:10:36,775 --> 02:10:46,116
As fire is burning here is true,
so is body getting cremated.

1249
02:11:02,635 --> 02:11:05,798
There are nine ways of
devotion in this world.

1250
02:11:07,139 --> 02:11:10,131
You're devoted to me in
all the ways.

1251
02:11:11,143 --> 02:11:18,379
As remembrance of it,
please keep these 9 coins.

1252
02:11:27,159 --> 02:11:30,322
When you're not there anymore,
why do l need these coins?

1253
02:11:30,496 --> 02:11:31,963
No...

1254
02:12:35,227 --> 02:12:38,560
l'm cured of my disease!
l'm cured!

1255
02:12:49,575 --> 02:12:51,042
Don't do this sacrifice, Baba!

1256
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:54,902
You're trying to give
your life to save mine.

1257
02:12:55,748 --> 02:13:03,052
l'm one among crore but you're God
who graces a crore people.

1258
02:13:03,589 --> 02:13:07,821
Don't sacrifice your life
for me and go away from us.

1259
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:09,420
Don't go away!

1260
02:13:11,063 --> 02:13:14,931
l told you ours is bond of many births!

1261
02:13:15,934 --> 02:13:18,061
The bond has snapped!

1262
02:13:19,271 --> 02:13:21,068
Please don't test us again.

1263
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:25,273
Would that God take away this God?

1264
02:13:26,945 --> 02:13:28,845
Can't avoid it.

1265
02:13:30,282 --> 02:13:32,273
When God calls,

1266
02:13:33,786 --> 02:13:35,447
one must reach his lap!

1267
02:13:35,621 --> 02:13:37,088
Please don't say like that, Baba.

1268
02:13:38,457 --> 02:13:43,622
l'm Nanavali saying
we'll not let you go away.

1269
02:13:44,296 --> 02:13:46,856
lf necessary,
l'll stop the moving time!

1270
02:13:47,633 --> 02:13:53,196
l'll stand against God
and save your life.

1271
02:13:54,106 --> 02:13:58,805
l'm leaving the body but
not this incarnation.

1272
02:13:59,978 --> 02:14:01,468
After l depart,

1273
02:14:02,314 --> 02:14:06,978
Shiridi must become a holy place
granting boons to its devotees.

1274
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:10,645
Like rivers flowing to join the sea,

1275
02:14:11,824 --> 02:14:15,817
people of all religions must
join as one in Shiridi.

1276
02:14:17,329 --> 02:14:19,820
God is one!

1277
02:14:25,671 --> 02:14:31,337
l want to see Das!

1278
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:33,341
Send him message.

1279
02:14:37,850 --> 02:14:42,685
lf they say wind is standing still,
should l've to believe it?

1280
02:14:42,855 --> 02:14:47,690
lf they say earth is melting down,
should l've to believe it?

1281
02:14:47,860 --> 02:14:52,524
lf they say sky's lifespan is over,
should l've to believe it?

1282
02:14:52,698 --> 02:14:59,695
lf they God will die,
should l've to believe it?

1283
02:15:00,372 --> 02:15:05,366
That will not happen...
l'll not let it happen...

1284
02:15:05,544 --> 02:15:10,379
Coming...l'm coming Baba...

1285
02:15:10,549 --> 02:15:15,384
l'm coming to stop the
approaching death...

1286
02:15:15,554 --> 02:15:23,051
l'm coming to sacrifice
my life to save yours...

1287
02:15:28,734 --> 02:15:35,902
How are we to live without
seeing you or without you?

1288
02:15:36,074 --> 02:15:38,736
How are we to bear this harsh truth?

1289
02:15:38,911 --> 02:15:41,573
Who would share our pain and sorrows?

1290
02:15:44,082 --> 02:15:46,744
You're my devotees...

1291
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:53,084
l'm a slave of your devotion...

1292
02:15:55,227 --> 02:16:00,096
l'm the sun, moon and stars...

1293
02:16:00,232 --> 02:16:04,225
l'll always be seen by you...

1294
02:16:04,603 --> 02:16:09,939
l'll always keep an eye on you...

1295
02:16:10,442 --> 02:16:19,942
l'm your Baba,
l'll carry your burden...

1296
02:16:25,123 --> 02:16:35,624
From my grave...
l'll answer from my grave...

1297
02:16:35,801 --> 02:16:40,966
lf you seek help,
l'll come to you...

1298
02:16:44,643 --> 02:16:57,818
lf you call, l'll answer you...

1299
02:17:01,159 --> 02:17:04,651
... l'll answer you...

1300
02:17:23,849 --> 02:17:28,684
You said your devotees
won't lack in anything.

1301
02:17:28,854 --> 02:17:31,516
But we don't have light.
We don't have shade!

1302
02:17:32,024 --> 02:17:34,686
Our lives have no meaning at all!

1303
02:17:35,193 --> 02:17:39,687
How are we to fill the void
of your absence, Baba?

1304
02:17:44,036 --> 02:17:49,872
With a clear peaceful mind...

1305
02:17:51,543 --> 02:17:58,540
With unwavering devotion...

1306
02:18:06,058 --> 02:18:09,050
Think of me...

1307
02:18:11,063 --> 02:18:14,897
l'll preside in your hearts...

1308
02:18:16,068 --> 02:18:19,231
Chant my name...

1309
02:18:21,073 --> 02:18:24,565
l'll vanish your sorrows...

1310
02:18:26,244 --> 02:18:29,736
Join the prayers of my Arathi...

1311
02:18:31,249 --> 02:18:34,582
l'll stall dangers in your life...

1312
02:18:36,388 --> 02:18:39,915
Apply my sacred ash...

1313
02:18:41,093 --> 02:18:46,087
l'll take your pain...

1314
02:18:46,264 --> 02:18:50,257
Light lamps for me...

1315
02:18:51,403 --> 02:18:56,272
l'll light up your lives...

1316
02:18:56,408 --> 02:19:00,504
Read my life story...

1317
02:19:01,279 --> 02:19:06,114
l'll make your life blessed one...

1318
02:19:07,619 --> 02:19:18,120
This is not death bed...
For refuge seekers it is bed of mercy...

1319
02:19:18,296 --> 02:19:26,795
This is not a grave but holy temple
that will ease your difficulties...

1320
02:19:26,972 --> 02:19:33,138
Treasure house of my divine grace...

1321
02:19:36,448 --> 02:19:55,460
Shiridi which grants boons of
peace and happiness...

1322
02:20:30,784 --> 02:22:08,963
A PuLi - DDR Presentation ;)
