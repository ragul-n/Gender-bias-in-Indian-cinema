00:03:06,474 --> 00:03:07,474
Dude…Truck..!

2
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:29,302
It won’t work, Raja

3
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:33,434
That day itself I told Pappan,

4
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:36,194
to find that boy and finish him.

5
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:39,033
That’s the only solution

6
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:43,353
You know what the consequence would be 
if Moopan finds him..

7
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:47,873
Okay. Cut the phone. I will call later

8
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,410
Oh God!

9
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:12,419
You!

10
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:28,557
My dear Folks,

11
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:29,557
Only if Earth exists,

12
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:31,597
there will be human 
beings, trees and rain!

13
00:04:31,797 --> 00:04:32,717
To recall this,

14
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:37,677
To protect soil from the 
clutches of soil mafia,

in Kadakassery Center this evening,

17
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,732

Sir!

54
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:02,005
Yes

55
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,028
Did you get Candles?

56
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:04,091
Yes Sir..I do have.

57
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:06,051
Keep it there and leave quickly

58
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,438
One Candle will do, Sir

59
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:11,387
Definitely! If we buy candles as per age,

60
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:12,966
then, we will have to 
order for another Cake

61
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:13,987
That’s correct!

62
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:16,731
Cake...bullshit!

63
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:19,957
In a station without S.I, 
many such things will happen!

-Isn’t there ASI here? 
- Damn it!

65
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:31,576
Bring him

66
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,280
Atleast once in a life time,

67
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,322
if step into the Police station,

68
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,827
and spend a day in Lock up

69
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:52,466
Thereafter life won’t be like earlier

70
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:55,354
You won’t be the same person

71
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:57,834
…after you return.

72
00:08:58,424 --> 00:08:59,144
Hey Move! You dog

73
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:07,447
You abduct women, aren’t you?

74
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:13,057
That is enough, sir.

If you thrash more, he may die!

76
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:18,467
It’s unlike olden days!

77
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:23,113
Okay, let’s cut the cake then.

78
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,088
Please come

79
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,113

- Thank you.

81
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:34,544
Get up

82
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:37,653
Your bullshit vehicle!

83
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:46,245
Take a breathe

84
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,534
Happy Birthday too you

85
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,574
- Did you see? It’s your money 
- Pity!

86
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:56,854
Are you okay now sir?

87
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:58,778
Give it to Sir

88
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:02,338
Cake had cut

89
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:04,702
There is extra here, Writer sir

Prameela Sir...Just a little sir

91
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,120
Come in

92
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:14,736
-Sir, Murugan - What?

93
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,408
I run a Driving School

94
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,371
I got a call from the Station,

95
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:20,276
For That..?

96
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,236
to come with book and Papers!

97
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,820
Philip Sir!

98
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,266
This is the other case…That Vehicle case! 
Go to him

99
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,796
-Do you have a cooling glass? 
- No

100
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:35,744
Do you need?

101
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,760
No.

102
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:38,704
Are you running a driving school 
with such lousy people?

103
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:41,798
Isn’t that your vehicle?

104
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:43,638
Then, you are also a co-accused!

105
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:45,598
Move and stand

106
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,638
I say you to move here

Muruketta...

109
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:57,531
As your mom pleaded, I gave you a job

110
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,982
Did you find only my vehicle for 
such shoddy jobs?

111
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:03,486
That is not the issue now

112
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:04,885
No, stop it!

113
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:06,912
Henceforth I shouldn’t see 
you in that vicinity!

114
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:07,672
Hey

115
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:10,003
Why are you ill treating him?

116
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,283
Aren’t we here to do that?

117
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:12,616
Sir, my Vehicle..

118
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:14,656
Bloody Vehicle! Get out of here!

119
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:16,776
Idiot

120
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,729
(Police Walkie talkie Speaking)

121
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,237
What’s in it?

122
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,350
I don’t know, bro

123
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:31,797
You stole it, isn’t it?

124
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,390
- It’s a gift from a person 
- Gift!

125
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:36,890
What gift is that?

126
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:42,904
- For your birthday? 
- No, it’s for a Wedding

127
00:11:43,464 --> 00:11:46,504
Wedding ? Whose? Your?

128
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:50,760
- Sadam’s! 
- Sadam?!

129
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:51,715
Yeah!

130
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:05,105
Don’t look at me and drive, 
look straight and drive, bro

131
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,463
Hey Chandu! Stop the Car

132
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:08,932
- What is the matter? 
- When will you be free?

133
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:09,896
Wait at the driving School

134
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:12,557
Let me reach there first and then come

135
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:13,464
Come soon okay

136
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:15,304
Bro, how many times have 
I told you to look straight and drive!

137
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:16,599
Can’t you see the road infront of you?

138
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:19,184
Don’t pull out the Gear! I require that

139
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:22,104
Eh! Park it on the side. Over there. Halt!

140
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,809
Never listen to what I say!

141
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:26,057
Take the key!

142
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:29,807
Where is he going so early?

143
00:12:29,924 --> 00:12:31,844
Hang the key there and head to RT office

144
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:33,975
- I need to go for an urgent work! 
- Okay

145
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:35,924
To hell with RT office!

146
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:38,065
- Chandu, I’m in a big trouble 
- What is the problem, buddy?

147
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:39,229
- Did her family come to know? 
- No

148
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:40,658
- Or your family knew? 
- No

149
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:41,728
- What else then? 
- Wait Chandu

150
00:12:41,783 --> 00:12:44,111
- Leave my hand 
- She refuses to come, Chandu

151
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:47,594
Needlessly had a big 
argument early morning!

152
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:48,955
She said no to Registrar’s 
office and marriage!

153
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,194
Now she is not even attending my calls

154
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:56,111
At least today, you needn’t have fought!

155
00:12:56,229 --> 00:12:59,613
Dude! Chandu!! What will I do now?

156
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,390
- What was the new issue today? 
- Same as usual!

157
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:04,974
She wants me to fly to 
Dubai soon after marriage

158
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,670
What else will she tell?

159
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,182
It was to make money 
that my dad had gone to Gulf!

160
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:11,583
He stayed there for 20 years

161
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:15,189
The only thing he earned is… 
My name! SADAM!

162
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:18,291
Sadam, you need not go to Gulf now! 
But just give a nod!

163
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:19,580
- Impossible! 
- Why?

164
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,690
If I agree to her conditions and marry,

165
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:24,225
- I’ll be in total trouble!! 
- Then don’t marry

166
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:26,625
What? Look at this!

167
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,010
It’s 9 now

168
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,040
Atleast by 10.30 
I should reach Registrar’s office

169
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,080
There’s no time, buddy!

170
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,510
Do one thing! Go to her house 
and convince her

171
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:37,715
- No, it won’t work 
- Why?

172
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,035
My Uncle is there! Her Dad!

173
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:41,846
Even now I tremble seeing him!

174
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,159
Not only during Childhood days, even now!

175
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:50,588
- Will it work if I go to her house? 
- What can you do?

176
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:01,982
Please understand..

177
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:02,614
Let me see

178
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:06,697
If you talk to his family, 
we may be relieved!

179
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:09,911
If children are not raised with discipline, 
they may walk away with someone!

180
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,560
But…only good will fall on us

181
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:18,447
You dumped me cleverly, right?

182
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:19,289
Laila!

183
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:29,377
Our Sadam..

184
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:31,937
You are the only one responsible 
for what he did!

185
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:35,367
If you wish to see him for the last time, 
come with me!

186
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,560
Tell me the matter

187
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:45,657
Come fast

188
00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:47,377
With whom is this Thangal’s 
daughter walking away!

189
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:48,057
Laila...

190
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:49,737
Laila...

191
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:51,257
Laila...

192
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,130
Hello…Hello..

193
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:57,323
Why the hell doesn’t he pick?

194
00:14:58,902 --> 00:14:59,942
With whom are you speaking to?

195
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:02,843
- Sadam 
- What? Sadam!!

196
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:05,441
Is he…Where are we going now?

197
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:09,164
Tell me where are we going now?

198
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:11,342
Give that phone to me

199
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,004
To Registrar’s office

200
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,761
He is waiting for you since morning.

201
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,995
Keep up your word!

202
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:23,370
It’s my mistake. I shouldn’t 
believe your words

203
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:25,691
Don’t destroy it. That’s my phone!

204
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:27,628
He will come soon

205
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,534
He needn’t come! Drop me home

206
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:32,526
How the hell will I make her understand!

207
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:34,347
Anyway you’ve come till here…

208
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:36,808
Situation will be bad if you go back.

209
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:40,941
So please wait for little more time! 
Where did this idiot go?

210
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,737
Now, will this burden fall on me, O God!

211
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:44,800
What did you say? Ah!

212
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:48,245
-No..I didn’t say anything. 
-Master! Everything is ok!

213
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,261
- Oh, is this the bride? 
- Yeah..Yeah

214
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:54,050
I’m Narayanan! Student 
of his driving school.

215
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,018
Let’s not delay it further!

216
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,355
-But, he hasn’t come! 
-Sir has already come

217
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:01,738
Not the Sir, I meant the groom

218
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:03,472
His phone is not reachable also

219
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,886
The person you call is not responding now

220
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:15,523
You wait here

221
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,469
What is the time now?

222
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,143
-He won’t wait 
-Please wait for little more time.

223
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,042
Where is she going?

224
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:24,707
My phone

225
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:37,214
Look at the time he arrives!!

226
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:38,928
Get in

227
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,448
O my Lord!

228
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:54,878
Do you know me?

229
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:55,784
Of course! Sadam’s Dad!

230
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:58,417
Ain’t I? Who the hell 
are you to perform my son’s wedding?

231
00:16:58,617 --> 00:16:59,577
Dad! He is my friend

232
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:00,106
Sorry..Sorry..

233
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:01,090
How dare you perform my son’s marriage!

234
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,152
Listen to my father.

235
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:06,629
In the case of the female it is. 
He's got a good beat anyway

236
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,850
Master..Master I’d bought this for them.

237
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:15,146
When they get married in future, 
give this to them on my behalf.

238
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:26,730
Sir! It all happened due 
to a misunderstanding

239
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,447
I’ll explain in detail

240
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:31,982
Didn’t I tell you in simple 
language that it won’t work?

241
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:32,634
Please Sir

242
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:34,554
Kasim Bhaba is directly 
involved in this Case!

243
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,087
If there’s anyone with higher range 
something can be done!

244
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,043
Hello Jayaetta!

245
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:58,327
Welcome Jaya

246
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:00,552
What is need for a Lawyer? 
No Case is filed.

247
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,425
Keep that all inside, Mr.Advocate!

248
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:06,277
To throw dust into the 
eyes of Protesters, I..

249
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:08,603
dude..My number came up

250
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:12,267
Philip! Police is not 
to satisfy Protesters!

251
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:17,619
My quarry is operating not without license!

252
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:18,731
That I know

253
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,971
Even earlier, these Protesters 
have tried a lot to hook me!

254
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:27,518
Until I hold the legal papers 
got by engaging top lawyers,

255
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,952
even if I scoop away the whole hill,

256
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,603
no one can dare question me!

257
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:32,723
Awesome guy..?

258
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:33,683
No Jaya, the fact was,

259
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:35,777
Many people had waylaid the Truck,

260
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:38,082
And I should also retain my 
position, right? I did it for that!

261
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:41,514
Give Cake to Jayan. It was her birthday

262
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:42,834
Advocate, have Cake

263
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:46,114
As per law, you were supposed 
to protect the Workers,

264
00:18:46,762 --> 00:18:48,802
Why do you make things 
complicated, Mr.Advocate?

265
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,699
Nothing serious happened, right?

266
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:52,725
Prameela, give Jayan’s keys!

267
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,277
Don't just eat ants.

268
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:00,497
Happy Birth Day

269
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:06,917
While seizing the Truck, 
Radhakrishna lost control!

270
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:08,837
-Nothing serious, isn’t it? 
-No

271
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:12,566
Oh, was it you?

272
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:18,191
Jayan never steps into a Police station.

273
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:22,391
-And now you made it happen! Hey you! 
-What man!

274
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,948
Who is he? He is Sand Jayan!

275
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:29,121
In case you’re acting smart 
because of this Uniform,

276
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,969
To make you take that off, 
this is more than enough!!

277
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:33,695
Don’t make a scene!

278
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:37,089
Radhakrishna, get inside

279
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:44,451
Jayan! One thing. Bail him also out

280
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:48,676
Come down with him

281
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:53,027
A love Case! Troublesome!!

282
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:56,629
Can’t leave him that easily! 
Kasim Bhaba is involved!

283
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,489
If Kasim Bhaba is involved.. 
Then Jayan will take him out!

284
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:05,864
Hey, Sir.. please release him

285
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:10,137
Keep that down,

286
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,486
Where to get it..?

287
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:14,535
I’m afraid to go inside

288
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:22,953
How do you come to know all this?

289
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:24,873
Don’t you watch T.V or read newspapers?

290
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:28,153
There’s only this news everywhere! 
Take this also

291
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,270
Apart from boys, girls 
are also there it seems

292
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:32,051
Everyone is standing in 
the courtyard itself

293
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:35,772
You are not aware of the happenings, sis!

294
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:37,973
Hell with these kids!

295
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:41,251
I will be back now

296
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:44,691
I will surely pay back

297
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:45,814
Son!

298
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,504
-Something wrong! 
-What mom?

299
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:54,257
-Did your Car hit somewhere? 
-Yeah..Yeah

300
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,629
How many times do I tell 
you to drive carefully?

301
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,029
Let me see if there is any medicine at home

302
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,340
Don’t ever take such nasty jobs!

303
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,164
It’s not a big issue! 
Such things happen while driving!

304
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:14,204
-Better go to the Doctor and take medicine! 
-Okay

305
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:22,263
-Dude, Laila is not attending my calls 
-You just shut up!

306
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:30,499
I lost my job and also 
got thrashed by Police!

307
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:33,499
But you are only concerned 
of your problems!!

308
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,513
-His damn mobile!! 
-Hey Chandu!

309
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,713
I want my mobile back tomorrow

310
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:45,598
Hey Chandu! Chandu! Wait.

311
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:50,825
Don’t say that, Dude! Didn’t I?

312
00:21:51,856 --> 00:21:54,576
Didn’t I come to the Police station 
to help you out?

313
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:57,696
-Yes! You helped yourself a lot! 
-Shut up!

314
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:01,936
Gopi, he is here

315
00:22:05,254 --> 00:22:08,082
Chandu! Laila’s brother!

316
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,700
Come.

317
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:16,197
Dude, are you in full fit?

318
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:18,465
Ah..Yes

319
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:19,588
Then come, dude

320
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,072
If there is a daring enough 
man to take away Kasim Bhaba’s daughter,

321
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:32,958
then, I must get acquainted, right?

322
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:35,518
Oh! So you’re here to get acquainted?

323
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:41,126
Well, I’m Chandu and this 
is your Bro-in-law Sadam

324
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,645
Your name?

325
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,535
When I could get off the 
station that easily,

326
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:50,859
I’ve absolutely no fear 
to step in there also.

327
00:22:51,684 --> 00:22:55,164
Then, I’m a low class, 
but you are not such,

328
00:22:55,364 --> 00:22:57,754
Your trouser will tear! Understood?

329
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,999
If it was Kasim Bhaba who got me locked,

330
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:04,326
the one who took me out was Sand Jayan..

331
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,439
Sand Jayan..!

332
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,759
They belong to Sand Jayan team

333
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:10,316
We have to get details about them first

334
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:13,461
Go! Go! Go! Get lost!

335
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:16,014
Get lost!

336
00:23:47,237 --> 00:23:49,557
-Aunty, where is mom? 
-She is fetching water

337
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,619
Aren’t you going to Driving school today?

338
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:06,389
No mood today, mom! I’ve severe body pain

339
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:11,695
Chandu, check that water pump motor! 
Tired off drawing water!

340
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,641
-What damn shop are you running? 
-Please let me talk

341
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:20,772
- Don’t talk.. 
- Isn’t this just a memory card?

342
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:22,081
Don’t talk anything.

343
00:24:22,123 --> 00:24:23,397
This is a Memory Card? Understood

344
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:26,107
It’s not something that recognizes a face!

345
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:27,076
A mistake happened!

346
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:29,761
If you make such mistakes, 
I’ll smash your face!

347
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:31,587
Wait bro, I will sort this. 
What is the issue, dude?

348
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:33,601
Memory card got misplaced! A big mess!

349
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:39,537
I understood! Come here bro! 
Hope no one saw at home! ..

350
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,226
-Who the hell are you? His friend? 
-No way

351
00:24:41,386 --> 00:24:44,537
, You make him understand, Okay!

352
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:46,462
Chandu! It’s Laila calling

353
00:24:47,124 --> 00:24:49,644
Yeah coming dude! Make him understand.

354
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:52,244
-Hello..Hello Laila 
-Did you give phone to Chandu?

355
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:55,217
I will give him. It’s your 10th call today!

356
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:57,476
So you didn’t give him yet?

357
00:24:57,808 --> 00:24:59,648
Why does he need a phone now?

358
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,404
Because of you…he lost 
the job..that he had!

359
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,459
Hello..Hello...

360
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:14,147
O my goodness! That is 
enough, select a phone

361
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,839
-What? 
-Come on select any phone you like!

362
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:20,316
-You take this!

363
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:22,248
-Keep this 
-This?

364
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:24,246
-How to unlock this? -Eh!

365
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:25,664
How to remove the lock?

366
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:27,232
-No need to remove! – Then?

367
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:31,127
-Like this! Too simple. 
-Show the Camera

368
00:25:31,327 --> 00:25:33,247
Like this, is it?

369
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:36,178
Awesome rush....

370
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:37,498
O Pappettan!

371
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:43,576
Where does he go?

372
00:25:43,604 --> 00:25:46,124
FOREIGN LIQUOR

373
00:25:56,905 --> 00:26:01,145
My dear Unni! Get me liquor please

374
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,789
Any thing will do!

375
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:05,887
Also need some touching!

376
00:26:06,087 --> 00:26:07,047

377
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:09,527

00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:12,177

386
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,186
-Which one do you need?

00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:28,506

390
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:44,816
O my gift! Please come

391
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:01,732
It’s Matador’s Engine. Always strong!

392
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:02,904
Yes

393
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:07,811
It’s a Pearl..My boy!

394
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:14,850
-I’m the first driver of this jeep 
-You?

395
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:17,756
And the Cleaner was Jayan!

396
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:25,727
For 2000 bucks! Okay

397
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:28,047
Fill 200 less!

398
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,567
200?

399
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:32,303
Money for his drinks!

400
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:37,473
-Pappettan! New guy? 
-Yes bro

401
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:41,047
You fill it!

402
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:58,313
Here! Gulp one more also

403
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:07,913
Get down.. Get down I say 
Don’t dare sit on top of that!

404
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:09,804
Take this! Don’t damage your tender heart

405
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:19,498
From far, it looks like 
a shell upside down!

406
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:24,081
That’s why this hill was 
known as Chiratta(Shell)kunnu!

407
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:28,849
Now also its shape is correct.

408
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:32,493
Not upside down but lying flat on its back!

409
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:37,909
Inhabitants here were loggers earlier!

410
00:28:38,756 --> 00:28:41,725
When the trees were 
over..they became drivers!

411
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:43,862
And again drivers!

412
00:28:44,796 --> 00:28:48,967
These drivers are not 
fit for any other jobs!

413
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:53,281
No Pappettan! I’m also 
a Driver and You too one

414
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:55,073
Shall I ask you something?

415
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:58,295
Will anything happen around 
without these drivers?

416
00:28:58,576 --> 00:29:00,656
For dropping School children, 
Drivers are needed

417
00:29:01,194 --> 00:29:03,714
For rushing a dying person, 
Drivers are needed

418
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:04,954
Why not…

419
00:29:05,154 --> 00:29:06,514
Even for Ministers to 
attend inaugural function,

420
00:29:06,674 --> 00:29:08,034
Drivers are needed!

421
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:10,185
Right!

422
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:18,561
Pappetta! I lost my job.

423
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,936
Can you recommend to Jaynettan 
and get me a driver job?

424
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:24,583
This is a Sand Quarry!

425
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:29,183
Not any Employment office!

426
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,520
If you think, it’s possible!

427
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,320
It’s not any driving school as you imagine!

428
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,240
I also got heavy licence!

429
00:29:40,264 --> 00:29:41,264
It was good.

430
00:29:41,931 --> 00:29:44,811
Hold this!

431
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,881
It’s possible for you, Pappettan

432
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:53,736
Do one thing

433
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,600
- Come tomorrow, I will talk to Jayan. 
-Okay

434
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:20,528
You people bashed around 38 yesterday.

435
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:24,164
It’s me who spends and 
not your dad, okay!

436
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:28,207
Pappan! Come here

437
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,487
Jayan, I mentioned..

438
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:34,766
-Isn’t he the one whom we took out from 
lock up the other day?- Yeah!

439
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,617
He lost his job,

440
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:40,057
He is a good driver! Aren’t you?

441
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:41,942
He also holds a heavy licence

442
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:45,851
It’s not Licence what this 
Jayan’s worker should have!

443
00:30:47,994 --> 00:30:50,154
Ganesha! Come here.

444
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:55,314
Give the key of 9691

445
00:30:59,202 --> 00:31:01,722
You first need to drive 
the truck and show to him

446
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:06,807
Then I’ll decide to take you or not!

447
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:11,681
Come on..Get in..

448
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,570
Go my dear gift!

449
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:28,358
He holds a real licence, is it?

450
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:43,876
Only based on your recommendation, 
I’ve given him the keys!

451
00:31:57,642 --> 00:31:59,345
Would I lose a truck?

452
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,760
So he holds a Heavy licence then!

453
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:02,609
It’s good to have one equal 
to Ganeshan in our team!

454
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,067
Come on!

455
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,521
Take out the Cash

456
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,566
What the hell he is doing?

457
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:29,071
-Keep this for your expenses! 
-Take it.

458
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:30,484
Take it man

Hey, lick and count like this! 
What is the need for a machine then?

00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:25,178
Do one thing! Drop them. 
They will direct you the route

528
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,885
-Cash… 
- It’s with you

529
00:39:27,137 --> 00:39:29,057
-I will hand it over to Ganeshan 
- Okay

530
00:40:01,228 --> 00:40:04,668
Sister, eyes to see the 
vehicle coming from the front

531
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,671
Hands to hold the steering like this!

532
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,551
Ears to give way to vehicle 
after hearing honking

533
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:12,917
Legs to apply brake and to 
increase the speed! Got it?

534
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:14,837
I will not repeat, start the Car

535
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,030
Will it be a problem 
if I shake my hand like this?

536
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:33,384
“We go leaning and swaying 
on the flower-ridge,

537
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:42,090
created by seasons”

538
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,905
“You smiled near me 
like moonlight”

539
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:58,191
“The wheel is moving 
my mind is following”

540
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:10,326
“We go leaning and swaying 
on the flower-ridge,

541
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,670
created by seasons”

542
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:19,261
“You smiled near me 
like moonlight”

543
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:27,263
“The way is far…far away 
my mind is following”

544
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:33,223
Oh Grand mother

545
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,898
Wait, you go to your mom

546
00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:11,229
“Scattering dreams each day, 
carrying hopes in each path,”

547
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:19,901
“Wishing heartily for dawn, 
the eyes are lengthening, eager to see”

548
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:32,634
“Slipping away like petals in the breeze 
the words in the ears turn into songs”

549
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:41,447
”In the mirror of your lovely eyes, 
I saw myself”

550
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:46,070
“In this path where the fragrance of 
“kaithola” flowers waft”

551
00:42:46,137 --> 00:42:53,783
“You and I are searching for a shore.”

552
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:59,033
“We go leaning and swaying 
on the flower-ridge,

553
00:42:59,193 --> 00:43:03,564
created by seasons”

554
00:43:03,986 --> 00:43:08,330
“You smiled near me like moonlight”

555
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:12,389
“The wheel is moving 
my mind is following”

556
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:16,229
“The way is far…far away”

557
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,840
Come out, my dear!

558
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,160
Where is Sand Jayan? Call him

559
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,240
Throw him into the Jeep, 
bring the truck to the Station

560
00:44:18,473 --> 00:44:20,753
-Get in, - Hey go

561
00:44:46,612 --> 00:44:47,612
see...

562
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:13,373
“If I beat you, you can’t bear it”

563
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:16,253
“ You won’t be able to sleep for 4 months”

564
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:31,828
I wanted to host a party for you, 
but couldn’t!

565
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,645
You’d helped me that much!

566
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:39,526
I know you influenced higher 
officials and got me this transfer!

567
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,462
I’ll create some chance and come back here!

568
00:45:42,862 --> 00:45:44,062
Then, we’ll see!

569
00:45:44,262 --> 00:45:47,662
Okay…Have a good visit and come back!

570
00:45:48,427 --> 00:45:50,547
This Jayan will be here only! Okay

571
00:45:57,201 --> 00:46:00,081
I took charge here today, Pappa!

572
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:02,998
It’s been two weeks since I got the order!

573
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,478
I was waiting. Hope you know 
the specialty of this day!

574
00:46:07,438 --> 00:46:09,958
Jayan’s Quarry licence expires today!

575
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:14,278
Well Pappa! Isn’t Jayan 
aware of me taking charge?

576
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:17,534
Won’t the work be stopped then?

577
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:22,767
Serve a glass of juice to Sir.

578
00:46:23,134 --> 00:46:25,044
Are you trying to call Jayan? 
Then tell him,

579
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:38,177
S.I Moopan is back after 
having a good visit,

580
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:40,427
As Kadagasherry S.I!!

581
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:47,738
If he is Manly, ask him to smuggle 
a load of sand via my station!

582
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,470
As you say, Ganeshan is not 
new to smuggling sand!

583
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,430
Please don’t exaggerate this case

584
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,110
We want the Ganeshan as 
well as the Truck back

585
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:08,630
Let’s see!

586
00:47:09,021 --> 00:47:12,261
Moopan has just taken charge! 
That’s why he is too annoyed

587
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:15,021
-We’ll sort it out. 
- Give the phone to me

588
00:47:17,146 --> 00:47:23,091
My many trucks are lying 
rusted in many Police stations!

589
00:47:23,544 --> 00:47:27,624
That’s not an issue for me.

590
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:30,304
All those were given as 
compliments to Police officers!

591
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:32,068
But this Truck,

592
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:36,849
Even if it lies atleast for 
a day infront of Moopan’s station,

593
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:38,769
Then, that’s my defeat!

594
00:47:39,536 --> 00:47:41,129
That should never happen

595
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:47,618
Cut the phone! I know what to do.

596
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:57,872
You ask him to come

597
00:48:02,287 --> 00:48:03,407
Come in!

598
00:48:09,896 --> 00:48:10,696
Bro!

599
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:24,997
You got to carry a load tomorrow night!

600
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:31,119
Not free of cost

601
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,999
If you reach the load at 
the said destination,

602
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:36,654
I will offer you that Truck!

603
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:38,119
What do you say?

604
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:02,179
Pappaettan! How much will this cost now?

605
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:05,819
A second hand one!

606
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,440
Nearly 8-8.5 lacs

607
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:14,266
Vijayan, come here!

608
00:49:20,477 --> 00:49:21,517
Not free of cost,

609
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:24,677
If you reach the load 
at the said destination

610
00:49:25,953 --> 00:49:27,843
I will offer you that Truck.

611
00:49:34,175 --> 00:49:36,695
Thank God! I was afraid 
that it might go down !

612
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,029
Will my truck ditch me?

613
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:41,229
I am holding this Steering for 12 yrs

614
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:43,629
He knows my financial condition better

615
00:49:50,148 --> 00:49:52,159
Ha ha, Flat tyre…!

616
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,200
However it was good that 
you lost job in the Driving school

617
00:49:58,308 --> 00:50:00,108
That time I was a bit disappointed.

618
00:50:00,308 --> 00:50:03,388
Now I feel big trucks are far better 
to drive than small Cars!

619
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:09,638
Listen! I am not driving a big truck.. 
It’s a Small one

620
00:50:10,082 --> 00:50:12,242
No matter big or small, isn’t it a truck?

621
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:14,247
I will borrow loan from Kudumbasree 
(Women Organisation)

622
00:50:14,582 --> 00:50:16,222
We’ll withdraw the Chit fund amount

623
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,750
Why can’t we buy a truck?

624
00:50:22,292 --> 00:50:23,692
We’ll buy it later

625
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,100
First serve me some more curry! Very tasty!

626
00:50:27,722 --> 00:50:30,082
Buying truck borrowing 
loan from kudumbasree!!

627
00:50:34,175 --> 00:50:37,375
Why we needlessly involve in 
the fracas of Policeman and Jayan!

628
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:38,216
We?

629
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:43,063
When you are involved, there is no need 
of my separate involvement, right?

630
00:50:43,223 --> 00:50:45,503
- It’s a risk, buddy 
- Yes I know

631
00:50:46,058 --> 00:50:49,498
But If take that risk now, 
it will benefit us in future.

632
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:53,178
Would he keep his word of 
offering you a Truck?

633
00:50:53,498 --> 00:50:54,818
He is Serious, isn’t it?

634
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:56,800
What if he ditches us?

635
00:50:57,402 --> 00:50:58,322
Let’s see

636
00:50:58,527 --> 00:51:00,456
I may also become rich like Jayan!

637
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:05,162
- Stop..Stop 
- What’s it?

638
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:06,442
- Stop I say 
- What?

639
00:51:06,642 --> 00:51:07,562
Stop I say

640
00:51:09,558 --> 00:51:11,958
- Jayanettan’s daughter! 
- Yeah, you wait.

641
00:51:16,753 --> 00:51:18,153
- Why are you waiting here? 
- Mom went upstairs.

642
00:51:18,313 --> 00:51:20,833
- Oh! I’ve good news 
- What?

643
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,766
- I’m planning to buy a truck 
- Really?

644
00:51:24,063 --> 00:51:26,263
How long I keep driving others vehicles?

645
00:51:26,423 --> 00:51:27,023
- Ain’t I right? 
- Yes Yes

646
00:51:27,223 --> 00:51:30,430
Chandu! Enough!

647
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,623
Wait coming

648
00:51:31,823 --> 00:51:33,343
My friend! You’ve a surprise

649
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:34,503
Surprise?

650
00:51:35,344 --> 00:51:36,664
I will tell you the next time

651
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:37,944
Tell and go

652
00:51:38,144 --> 00:51:38,984
No I will tell later

653
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:40,304
My friend is waiting! He is in a hurry

654
00:51:40,504 --> 00:51:41,224
See you then, bye

655
00:51:41,424 --> 00:51:42,544
Tell me and go

656
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:43,664
I’ll tell later

657
00:51:49,571 --> 00:51:50,411
Where is your helmet?

658
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:52,291
Pay the fine and go

659
00:51:52,451 --> 00:51:53,531
Sir, I don’t have money

660
00:51:53,851 --> 00:51:55,091
Driving without a helmet?!

661
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:57,933
Move away and stand

662
00:51:58,454 --> 00:52:01,672
-Move 
–Sir please tell him to leave me

663
00:52:03,297 --> 00:52:05,617
Sir, it’s Jayan speaking

664
00:52:05,977 --> 00:52:07,057
Sand Jayan!

665
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:10,320
Do you need to specify your 
nick name to recognize you?

666
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:15,078
Isn’t that my house name now? Let it be.

667
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:19,842
I am going to shoot the 
ball you passed to me

668
00:52:20,743 --> 00:52:22,609
If I am able to score a goal 
then I’ll stop the game

669
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:25,047
Isn’t that the decorum?

670
00:52:25,766 --> 00:52:31,286
This Jayan’s one load of sand will pass 
through your, S.I Moopan’s station limits,

671
00:52:32,336 --> 00:52:34,536
today..right away

672
00:53:45,011 --> 00:53:46,131
Why this rush?

673
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:48,784
S.I has asked us to rush up

674
00:53:48,948 --> 00:53:50,788
As if he!

675
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:52,468
It’s all in vain!

676
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:02,572
That scoundrel beat you 
black and blue, is it?

677
00:54:05,652 --> 00:54:08,012
Either he must pack his box and get away,

678
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:12,571
Or he should be into the box forever!

679
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,893
Either way, let that not be 
carried in your account!

680
00:54:42,837 --> 00:54:43,485
Hello..

681
00:54:43,688 --> 00:54:45,328
There is a chance of Police chasing you

682
00:54:45,768 --> 00:54:47,568
-Change your route 
-Okay dude

683
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:24,184
Nope!

684
00:57:28,856 --> 00:57:29,376
Oh Sir!

685
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:30,776
Sir!

686
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:31,965
Sir!

687
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:54,822
It was needless to rush, wasn’t it, Sir?

688
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,822
Sir, he is trying to flee! Go and check

689
00:58:09,044 --> 00:58:09,673
You!

690
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,306
Sir, it’s our S.I

691
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,392
Stop..Stop..Sir..

692
00:58:24,388 --> 00:58:25,668
Where the hell were you?

693
00:58:26,728 --> 00:58:28,128
What is this.. blood?! Where is the Truck?

694
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,251
I will tell you, let’s move.

695
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:31,877
- Tell me the matter. 
- I will tell you, you move.

696
00:58:44,283 --> 00:58:45,523
You said the bike skid, isn’t it?

697
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:46,587
Injury is on his head

698
00:58:46,803 --> 00:58:48,323
Got to take a scan!

699
00:58:48,523 --> 00:58:49,790
- Please come. 
-Go

700
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:50,763
Okay sir

701
00:59:09,369 --> 00:59:12,369
Moopan would’ve been finished,

702
00:59:13,169 --> 00:59:15,249
but that stupid boy..That Chandu,

703
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:16,849
foiled our plan!

704
00:59:21,649 --> 00:59:24,642
I did all this after 
listening to your bullshit advice.

705
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:28,453
You’re still "Sand Jayan" 
because you listen to my advice!

706
00:59:29,307 --> 00:59:30,587
No matter you listen or not

707
00:59:31,307 --> 00:59:32,387
It was an utter foolishness!

708
00:59:36,408 --> 00:59:37,528
What is happened has happened!

709
00:59:38,494 --> 00:59:41,694
Now tell me advocate, what should I do now?

710
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:44,254
Don’t release those two trucks!

711
00:59:44,454 --> 00:59:46,214
Particularly the truck that hit Moopan!

712
00:59:47,471 --> 00:59:52,711
As you imagine, it’s not that easy 
to pin up the case over that boy!

713
00:59:54,337 --> 00:59:56,057
If Police catches that trucker,

714
00:59:56,157 --> 00:59:57,677
Jaya…Look..

715
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,920
Jaya..No..No

716
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:06,283
Who the hell you think of yourself?

717
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,111
- No Jayaettan! Please 
- Don’t dare lay hands on me!

718
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,560
No Chandu!

719
01:00:13,886 --> 01:00:14,923
Listen to me!

720
01:00:15,103 --> 01:00:16,103
Jaya..No.

721
01:00:16,439 --> 01:00:21,369
Is that bloody policeman’s hospitalization 
more important than the task I assigned!

722
01:00:21,477 --> 01:00:23,357
Is he your dad?

723
01:00:24,197 --> 01:00:25,580
Take off your hand

724
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:26,751
Jaya..

725
01:00:26,853 --> 01:00:29,837
Laying hands on me without 
dispatching the load!!

726
01:00:30,228 --> 01:00:30,892
Jaya..No..

727
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:33,001
This Chandu knows how to dispatch the load

728
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:34,494
Amid it’s you who played the lousy tricks..

729
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:37,534
Who sent Ganeshan after me?

730
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,565
He would’nt have come to the spot 
without your knowledge

731
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:41,325
If he hadn’t played his lousy tricks,

732
01:00:41,525 --> 01:00:43,285
truck would’ve reached its destination!

733
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,565
Take him away!

734
01:00:44,765 --> 01:00:46,009
Leave...leave..

735
01:00:46,244 --> 01:00:46,884
Leave,

736
01:00:47,004 --> 01:00:47,830
Leave I say

737
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:48,580
Father..

738
01:00:50,963 --> 01:00:52,123
No..no

739
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:58,501
Hey Pappan, because of this fellow, 
my asset is in the Station now

740
01:00:58,932 --> 01:01:01,652
Jayan will play… play lousy tricks!

741
01:01:01,732 --> 01:01:04,532
But I want my asset right away here.

742
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:07,852
Otherwise.. Warn him what will happen

743
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:19,228
Get away..

744
01:01:19,336 --> 01:01:20,576
Why do you guys come here at this hour?

745
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,069
Go...

746
01:01:30,585 --> 01:01:32,105
What are you going to do now?

747
01:01:32,841 --> 01:01:34,761
I clearly know what I must do now

748
01:01:36,773 --> 01:01:38,613
Despite doing all jobs he commanded us,

749
01:01:39,372 --> 01:01:41,132
he finally fixed us, isn’t it?

750
01:01:42,273 --> 01:01:43,473
He doesn’t know me

751
01:01:43,673 --> 01:01:44,953
That truck is for us

752
01:01:45,553 --> 01:01:48,353
If I give that up, 
then we’ll incur loss and not him

753
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,833
I will show you what should be done next

754
01:02:30,868 --> 01:02:32,388
No use of all this, Sir

755
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:33,639
Hey ...?

756
01:02:35,764 --> 01:02:37,210
Sir, hurry up.. 
someone is taking away the truck

757
01:02:39,132 --> 01:02:40,888
Hey, stop.. stop

758
01:02:44,688 --> 01:02:45,488
Hey, Truck!

759
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:47,675
O Shit!

760
01:02:47,915 --> 01:02:49,835
A man under the wheels! Please check

761
01:02:50,035 --> 01:02:51,275
Get down and check

762
01:02:52,622 --> 01:02:53,639
Check dude

763
01:03:00,171 --> 01:03:01,178
Get up..

764
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:05,689
Chandu, come quickly

765
01:03:05,714 --> 01:03:06,963
Let me move this away

766
01:03:07,592 --> 01:03:08,553
Come fast

767
01:03:09,814 --> 01:03:11,046
Stop there

768
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,498
Dispose it quickly

769
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:15,522

770
01:03:16,817 --> 01:03:17,817
Take the Jeep

771
01:03:20,937 --> 01:03:21,417
Stop there.

772
01:03:21,617 --> 01:03:23,577
Come on move fast

773
01:03:24,097 --> 01:03:24,937
Sadam, you move

774
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:26,017
I will come

775
01:03:28,257 --> 01:03:29,137
Get away dude

776
01:04:21,974 --> 01:04:23,534
Where the hell did you go in this rain?

777
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:24,463
Haven’t you slept yet?

778
01:04:24,663 --> 01:04:27,263
No, how can I?

779
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:33,214
Stand there

780
01:04:34,779 --> 01:04:35,974
Wipe properly

781
01:04:41,631 --> 01:04:43,357
You sleep, mom! I already had dinner

782
01:04:44,871 --> 01:04:46,279
What is wrong with him?

783
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:24,532
Yes, Sadam

784
01:05:24,863 --> 01:05:27,863
As it’s a stolen truck, 
I'll tell you a price!

785
01:05:28,886 --> 01:05:30,932
If it’s okay with you, I will buy

786
01:05:31,175 --> 01:05:32,198
Give the phone to him

787
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:36,961
I’m terribly scared

788
01:05:38,049 --> 01:05:40,346
Let's go away with whatever amount we get!

789
01:05:40,738 --> 01:05:43,378
I’m afraid to come behind you, Chandu

790
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:47,493
Come here quickly with whatever you get!

794
01:06:15,381 --> 01:06:17,221
What's the use of brooding over now?

795
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:19,461
You should’ve done that earlier

796
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:22,061
And now, what tensions do 
 we have to face with this?

797
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:24,557
Speak something

798
01:06:25,557 --> 01:06:26,797
I’m almost dead!

799
01:06:29,897 --> 01:06:33,737
Why don’t we return this money to Jayan?

800
01:06:34,303 --> 01:06:35,743
Then, we needn’t fear of him, right?

801
01:06:37,162 --> 01:06:39,482
Let’s plead his mercy

802
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:44,641
You needn’t, I will do it.

803
01:07:06,248 --> 01:07:07,088

01:08:20,002 --> 01:08:21,322
Will you stand by me?

817
01:08:41,746 --> 01:08:42,426
Hello!

Will he get away with our gold?

Shut up! Don’t frighten me

831
01:09:50,862 --> 01:09:55,331
Would this Contessa cause any trouble? 
Would it?!

832

No..

Come dude!

844
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:23,213
However Chandu, this is not a Safe game!

845
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:26,890
What if they chase us?

846
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,650
Let's stay elsewhere for a few days!

847
01:11:34,042 --> 01:11:36,581
Dude! Henceforth, the number of 
our enemies will increase!

What you said is right!

849
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,186
Let’s stay elsewhere for a few days.

850
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,565
Where are you going with baggage?

851
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,223
I need to travel, mom

852
01:12:00,581 --> 01:12:02,983
I will return only after some days

853
01:12:26,378 --> 01:12:28,698
Jayettan! All unexpected 
things have happened!

854
01:12:33,034 --> 01:12:35,248

As per the calculations, 
we brought the Cash for a new truck

There are no dealings between us in this.

857
01:12:47,933 --> 01:12:50,093
We forgot about that Truck

858
01:12:50,573 --> 01:12:51,653
You too must!

01:12:53,815 --> 01:12:54,480

Was that fight, the Surprise for me?

862
01:13:17,096 --> 01:13:18,300
That was not deliberate

863
01:13:18,784 --> 01:13:20,179
One thanks is still due,

864
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,308
for rescuing me.

865
01:13:23,878 --> 01:13:27,078
Not only that, I was able to rescue 
another person also because of you.

866
01:13:28,547 --> 01:13:29,307
Thanks!

867
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,070

How can I walk without looking?

876
01:14:11,356 --> 01:14:12,761
Let there be light for some time.

877
01:14:14,425 --> 01:14:15,425

883
01:14:26,477 --> 01:14:27,815
Why is he like this?

01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:29,789
Give, I will keep it here

885
01:14:34,624 --> 01:14:36,690

How is it? Good, isn’t it?

887
01:14:41,263 --> 01:14:42,463
Yes, Excellent!

888
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,080
Very nice!

889
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,045
I shouldn’t step out of the room,

890
01:15:16,182 --> 01:15:17,502
shouldn’t speak in the mobile

891
01:15:17,803 --> 01:15:19,040
And you can do whatever you like ah!

892
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:23,610
When you gain one, you will lose another!

893
01:15:25,592 --> 01:15:26,952
That’s how we lose certain 
things in life, right?

894
01:16:02,139 --> 01:16:03,259
“Till this night and day is over”

895
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,686
“The whole world is running,

896
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:06,474
to see the festival of unseen dreams”

897
01:16:07,452 --> 01:16:08,572
“Till this night and day is over”

898
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:10,154
“The whole world is running,

899
01:16:10,257 --> 01:16:11,857
to see the festival of unseen dreams”

900
01:16:12,572 --> 01:16:15,975
“Now we can go a long distance,

901
01:16:18,272 --> 01:16:20,672
on this hill, sun is climbing up”

902
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,900
“Now we can fly”

903
01:16:23,585 --> 01:16:26,105
on this hill, sun is climbing up”

904
01:16:26,305 --> 01:16:27,998
“Now we can fly”

905
01:16:29,059 --> 01:16:33,699
“The world may join this 
path and disappear”

906
01:16:33,996 --> 01:16:39,063
“In a trice, life may 
take a different turn”

907
01:17:01,426 --> 01:17:06,346
“Somebody shared time in the night”

908
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:11,480
“And he went away searching 
for an unknown path”

909
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:14,578
“Though pains are still 
lingering in the heart”

910
01:17:14,688 --> 01:17:16,595
“There is only smile”

911
01:17:16,985 --> 01:17:21,298
“In the tears, you will come 
as a support, to go on”

912
01:17:21,467 --> 01:17:26,907
“The world may join this 
path and disappear”

913
01:17:27,228 --> 01:17:32,540
“In a trice, life may 
take a different turn”

914
01:17:33,009 --> 01:17:37,730
“The world may join this 
path and disappear”

915
01:17:37,965 --> 01:17:44,066
“In a trice, life may 
take a different turn”

916
01:17:44,308 --> 01:17:46,035
Hey come

917
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:17,078
Jayan…Please come and sit

918
01:18:17,438 --> 01:18:18,958
No, I will stand..

919
01:18:19,118 --> 01:18:21,158
I wish to talk to you

920
01:18:26,547 --> 01:18:27,900
Would like to have any drinks?

921
01:18:30,644 --> 01:18:33,416
Just take this as an 
opportunity for our meeting

922
01:18:35,392 --> 01:18:40,272
Few days back, you missed 
a truck from the Station, right?

923
01:18:42,699 --> 01:18:46,749
Only when we lose, 
we realize it’s true worth, don’t we?

924
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:51,382
It was on the day you missed your Truck,

925
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:56,547
that I lost my dear one!

926
01:19:31,483 --> 01:19:32,389
David!

927
01:19:34,022 --> 01:19:36,866
They killed my own boy!

928
01:19:38,241 --> 01:19:41,557
I can’t leave that

929
01:19:42,858 --> 01:19:44,969
And they also stole his bag.

930
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:49,109
There was some gold in that bag

931
01:20:07,733 --> 01:20:09,053
Till the Police station,

932
01:20:09,866 --> 01:20:11,346
we were behind them!

933
01:20:14,241 --> 01:20:15,459
It was from there, it went missing

934
01:20:18,233 --> 01:20:21,473
I wish to know who threw 
the dust into my eyes!

935
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:29,698
Contessa!

936
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:33,293
I still didn’t get the 
guys who fled in the bike.

937
01:20:34,226 --> 01:20:35,546
But I’m sure of one thing

938
01:20:36,569 --> 01:20:40,209
Only till the Police station 
they had the bag with them.

939
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,915
It went missing in front 
of the Police Station!

940
01:20:45,654 --> 01:20:47,974
Someone else has found it

941
01:20:48,547 --> 01:20:49,347
Because,

942
01:20:49,999 --> 01:20:52,975
those who found had sold 
this in Madi Jewellery

943
01:20:53,131 --> 01:20:55,436
And just escaped!

944
01:20:57,226 --> 01:20:59,306
Only if I tell you all the details,

945
01:20:59,451 --> 01:21:01,225
you can help me, isn't it, Jayan?

946
01:21:03,616 --> 01:21:07,146
I only wish to know one thing

947
01:21:09,584 --> 01:21:12,017
Who stole the Truck from the Station?

948
01:21:12,607 --> 01:21:14,687
Any leads?

949
01:21:16,342 --> 01:21:18,125
I will enquire ji!

950
01:21:18,976 --> 01:21:19,976
Yes.

951
01:21:22,343 --> 01:21:25,913
So you neither enquired 
nor felt like enquiring!

952
01:21:28,155 --> 01:21:31,675
As it was seized by the 
Police, I just wrote it off!

953
01:21:31,995 --> 01:21:33,647
What is the use of analyzing 
dead one’s horoscope?!

954
01:21:33,832 --> 01:21:37,152
You don’t worry, ji! I will 
definitely get you a lead

955
01:21:40,584 --> 01:21:43,144
Well Ji! You’ve been to my 
house for the first time

956
01:21:43,623 --> 01:21:44,951
and leaving without having anything?

957
01:21:45,983 --> 01:21:48,111
According to me 
Gold and Time are one and the same

958
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:49,868
I don’t wish to lose!

959
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:03,741
hey..

960
01:22:07,311 --> 01:22:11,194
If such a bigwig comes in search of me,

961
01:22:11,514 --> 01:22:14,235
that means the lost good 
is not a trivial one!

962
01:22:17,358 --> 01:22:20,975
How much price does the truck 
they sold would fetch?

963
01:22:21,867 --> 01:22:25,227
- Maximum 3 -3.5 lacs 
- Okay

964
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:26,710
How much cash did they give?

965
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,190
Eight lakhs!

966
01:22:29,287 --> 01:22:30,447
How did they arrange the rest?

967
01:22:31,601 --> 01:22:33,001
Do one thing then

968
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,361
Bring those guys secretly to me!

969
01:22:37,756 --> 01:22:40,276
Do we need to take risk?

970
01:22:43,108 --> 01:22:46,308
So you started realizing things!

971
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,678
Come Pappa!

972
01:22:50,148 --> 01:22:59,178
The protest movement needs permission

973
01:23:00,484 --> 01:23:02,523
I can’t tell you to carry 
on with the protest

974
01:23:02,613 --> 01:23:03,843
Because I’m a Police officer

975
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:07,826
And Law has its own rules

976
01:23:08,026 --> 01:23:09,866
We’ve also moved as per law

977
01:23:10,281 --> 01:23:11,881
That’s why we received the Stay order!

978
01:23:12,259 --> 01:23:14,099
Jayan’s men are inside this Station

979
01:23:14,299 --> 01:23:15,781
And you are also aware of that

980
01:23:15,906 --> 01:23:16,656
Yes.

981
01:23:16,802 --> 01:23:17,482
Sir...

982
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:23,970
Okay, you leave, I will see to it.

983
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:25,218
- Thank you 
- Okay Okay

984
01:23:34,765 --> 01:23:37,843
Sir, I wished to come and 
 see you in the hospital

985
01:23:38,171 --> 01:23:41,451
By then, I got a suspension 
and was busy with that!

986
01:23:41,738 --> 01:23:42,818
Why did you call me, Sir?

987
01:23:42,971 --> 01:23:44,691
I have just one thing to tell you

988
01:23:45,656 --> 01:23:48,425
This sailing on two boats 
 must be stopped at once!

989
01:23:48,711 --> 01:23:49,631
Why do you talk like that, Sir?

990
01:23:49,831 --> 01:23:51,882
It’s the Government who pays your Salary,

991
01:23:52,062 --> 01:23:53,382
and not Sand Jayan!

992
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:54,941
Listen!

993
01:23:55,218 --> 01:23:58,981
I want the stolen truck 
and the trucker that hit me right here!

994
01:23:59,093 --> 01:24:00,718
- That…Sir, I.. 
- Stop it.

995
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,928
To change your suspension 
to dismissal is not a big thing for me!

996
01:24:04,128 --> 01:24:05,070
I won’t do such a thing

997
01:24:05,203 --> 01:24:06,851
Because I want you right here

998
01:24:07,062 --> 01:24:08,222
At this Station limits!

999
01:24:08,422 --> 01:24:10,109
Let me see if I can mend you!

1000
01:24:15,922 --> 01:24:17,288
Moopan must have got some leads

1001
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,740
That’s why he is in such a speed!

1002
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,780
Shucks! I didn’t get time to act also

1003
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,940
You lost your Cap and Lathi also!

1004
01:24:24,281 --> 01:24:25,700
Being in Suspension, 
what the hell can you do?

1005
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:28,485
Though in Suspension, 
a Police is a Police!

1006
01:24:29,045 --> 01:24:29,805
As if!

1007
01:24:30,687 --> 01:24:35,205
Sir, Please take a gulp

1008
01:24:37,433 --> 01:24:38,633
What to do?

1009
01:24:42,648 --> 01:24:46,608
Definitely he will find out 
who stole the truck from the Station.

1010
01:24:47,078 --> 01:24:48,007
And if he catches him,

1011
01:24:48,187 --> 01:24:51,307
That boy will blurt out everything! 
That is for sure

1012
01:24:51,538 --> 01:24:55,558
So better find out where that guy is! 
That’ll be good!

1013
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:04,960
Not this…

1014
01:25:05,442 --> 01:25:07,842
I will get you another one

1015
01:25:07,927 --> 01:25:09,007
Keep quiet bro!

1016
01:25:09,709 --> 01:25:11,069
You tell the same whenever you see me!

1017
01:25:11,285 --> 01:25:13,045
Don’t say like that, my pearl.

1018
01:25:13,245 --> 01:25:15,125
In my mobile also, a few matters are there!

1019
01:25:15,325 --> 01:25:17,005
Please don’t fix me!

1020
01:25:17,205 --> 01:25:18,725
So you’ve fear, right?

1021
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:26,654
If Laila comes to know 
I stayed in such a lousy place,

1022
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,588
my life will be at stake!

1023
01:25:32,225 --> 01:25:34,373
I don’t think we’ll be chased anymore!

1024
01:25:34,521 --> 01:25:36,385
For, they should’ve done that long ago!

1025
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:40,373
If we keep staying away for a long time, 
People may doubt

1026
01:25:40,613 --> 01:25:42,813
It was you who suggested this idea!

1027
01:25:42,927 --> 01:25:45,703
So what if I said? 
Shouldn’t there be an end to it!

1028
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:49,687
It’s like being in a prison…

1029
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,960
I’m going.

1030
01:25:52,217 --> 01:25:53,021
Sadam..

1031
01:25:54,522 --> 01:25:57,662
On one side Police… the other - Contessa!

1032
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:00,006
Contessa! Bullshit!

1033
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,123
Isn’t that safe over there?

1034
01:26:01,265 --> 01:26:02,865
We can take it whenever we want!

1035
01:26:02,982 --> 01:26:05,195
Dude! Things are not as we imagine

1036
01:26:06,459 --> 01:26:08,662
Who created a brawl in 
Madi Jewellery the other day?

1037
01:26:09,512 --> 01:26:10,832
Didn’t a bike hit us,

1038
01:26:11,107 --> 01:26:12,379
Who rode that bike?

1039
01:26:12,569 --> 01:26:15,089
Wasn’t it you who told me 
 they went away by bike?

1040
01:26:15,289 --> 01:26:16,729
Then, where are they?

1041
01:26:17,395 --> 01:26:18,955
If that bag belongs to them,

1042
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:20,494
won’t they come looking for us?

1043
01:26:21,682 --> 01:26:24,224
But they are not aware 
that bag is with us!

1044
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:26,420
No..that Truck..

1045
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:28,580
Then Jayan..

1046
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:33,711
If they want, they can easily trace us!

1047
01:26:34,201 --> 01:26:36,561
O my Chandu! Don’t get 
tensed unnecessarily!

1048
01:26:37,147 --> 01:26:40,027
No kick even after a drink 
 is my plight now!

1049
01:26:41,381 --> 01:26:43,301
And besides, this lousy set up,

1050
01:26:44,107 --> 01:26:45,787
to distract concentration!

1051
01:26:58,498 --> 01:27:01,029
- Dude! 
- Sir, Like to have any touching?

1052
01:27:01,338 --> 01:27:05,178
Pickle, Snacks..Whatever you like

1053
01:27:06,061 --> 01:27:08,381
Shut up and get away! Hell with him!

1054
01:27:09,647 --> 01:27:11,847
What sort of people are they! Shucks!

1055
01:27:26,552 --> 01:27:30,334
Keep at least the door open.. 
Let the ventilation come

1056
01:27:31,201 --> 01:27:32,241
Okay no need

1057
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:34,799
It’s a complete playground

1058
01:27:35,121 --> 01:27:38,084
If all the Players get in 
you know what’ll happen!

1059
01:27:39,459 --> 01:27:43,552
If it’s that rascal… 
Definitely I’ll smash his face!

1060
01:27:53,459 --> 01:27:55,179
Pappaettan! You! Here?

1061
01:27:57,248 --> 01:27:58,448
Do you fear?

1062
01:28:01,115 --> 01:28:01,622
Is there ...?

1063
01:28:03,459 --> 01:28:04,790
You carry gold, don’t you?

1064
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:06,230
That too Contessa!

1065
01:28:20,371 --> 01:28:22,931
They will come! 
Sure to come at any cost!

1066
01:28:23,761 --> 01:28:25,411
They have no other option

1067
01:28:28,925 --> 01:28:29,816
Here they come!

1068
01:28:34,261 --> 01:28:35,222
Come, come!

1069
01:28:36,821 --> 01:28:38,021
Didn’t I say, Jaya?

1070
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:56,714
Hope you don’t carry any old grudges!

1071
01:29:01,925 --> 01:29:03,245
I’ve already forgotten it

1072
01:29:03,574 --> 01:29:06,206
You gave the Cash, didn’t you? Then what?

1073
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:08,050
Why is he like this?

1074
01:29:08,574 --> 01:29:09,454
Come guys!

1075
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,520
I came to know the happenings.

1076
01:29:14,078 --> 01:29:16,318
Careful! Be very careful

1077
01:29:17,613 --> 01:29:18,597
Don’t worry!

1078
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:21,180
Till I’m beside you, 
no one can dare touch you

1079
01:29:21,853 --> 01:29:22,597
Come.

1080
01:29:27,082 --> 01:29:28,962
The person whom we’re going 
to meet now is,

1081
01:29:29,162 --> 01:29:30,362
a close friend of mine!

1082
01:29:31,082 --> 01:29:32,042
Hi Jayan Bhai!

1083
01:29:32,202 --> 01:29:35,202
He will help you to sell your gold

1084
01:29:36,905 --> 01:29:39,065
Nothing to fear! You can trust him

1085
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:43,235
Once everything is done, 
please don’t forget this Jayanettan!

1086
01:29:43,839 --> 01:29:44,519
Deal!

1087
01:29:45,902 --> 01:29:46,933
As said and done!

1088
01:30:06,188 --> 01:30:10,305
Come..20..20 Rs ..70..70..70...

1089
01:30:13,171 --> 01:30:13,922
Hey..

1090
01:30:14,009 --> 01:30:14,657
Hey..

1091
01:30:15,698 --> 01:30:18,360
This thrashing is not to 
 make you tell the truth!

1092
01:30:25,056 --> 01:30:27,743
Do you think yourself to be 
God of death to run over me by truck?

1093
01:30:28,837 --> 01:30:29,837
Hey..Hey..

1094
01:30:30,648 --> 01:30:33,408
Attempting to kill a Police 
officer on duty, You rascal!

1095
01:30:34,743 --> 01:30:37,657
I know how to put you 
behind bars for life time.

1096
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:44,376
Right now I can present 
you before the Magistrate

1097
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:45,977
But I won’t do that

1098
01:30:46,188 --> 01:30:48,741
Because I will lose my chance

1099
01:30:50,735 --> 01:30:54,416
You rascal! I know on 
whose behest you did it!

1100
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:56,727
It’s not yet time to deal with him.

1101
01:30:57,072 --> 01:30:58,232
But that will happen soon!

1102
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:00,290
Bloody Sand Jayan!

1103
01:31:04,478 --> 01:31:06,958
Moopan will present Ganeshan before 
the Judge right today

1104
01:31:07,298 --> 01:31:08,298
Remand is for sure

1105
01:31:09,138 --> 01:31:12,138
If Court permits, 
Moopan will get him for interrogation

1106
01:31:12,338 --> 01:31:13,218
If they find the trucker also,

1107
01:31:13,418 --> 01:31:15,978
Then Police van will reach 
 your house looking for you!

1108
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:17,905
It may happen a little earlier also!

1109
01:31:18,215 --> 01:31:20,735
Well! I scoot away from your case

1110
01:31:21,596 --> 01:31:23,356
It’s a matter of my life, Jayan!

1111
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:28,700
Ungrateful swine!

1112
01:31:29,759 --> 01:31:31,524
I’m not sure that he is grateful or not!

1113
01:31:31,751 --> 01:31:33,111
But he talks perfect law

1114
01:31:33,311 --> 01:31:35,352
I’ve something more to tell!

1115
01:31:35,533 --> 01:31:37,413
You please stay away for sometime

1116
01:31:38,814 --> 01:31:41,654
Attempting to 
kill a Sub-inspector on duty is the Case!

1117
01:31:42,326 --> 01:31:44,886
This is my advice! 
Later don’t say I didn’t.

1118
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,360
Pappan! Remove the vehicle 
from there today itself!

1119
01:31:49,071 --> 01:31:50,391
If Police..

1120
01:31:50,594 --> 01:31:52,880
Don’t worry about Police and Moopan

1121
01:31:53,626 --> 01:31:56,586
Until the gold reaches my hand,

1122
01:31:57,066 --> 01:31:59,586
It’s wise that I don’t get caught by Moopan

1123
01:32:00,186 --> 01:32:01,706
It’s a waste of time! That’s why…

1124
01:32:03,165 --> 01:32:04,405
For the time being, I will stay away

1125
01:32:04,845 --> 01:32:07,485
And later attend to the Case etc!

1126
01:32:12,415 --> 01:32:15,135
I don’t understand what you say or do!

1127
01:32:18,251 --> 01:32:19,939
Listening to your words, 
I dismantled the truck

1128
01:32:20,329 --> 01:32:22,449
You order me to do this and that 
and I do..

1129
01:32:23,946 --> 01:32:26,186
At least now say, where are we heading to?

1130
01:32:26,395 --> 01:32:28,755
No change in what I say and do

1131
01:32:30,704 --> 01:32:33,224
We will leave tonight, Sadam

1132
01:32:33,704 --> 01:32:34,485
Where?

1133
01:32:34,664 --> 01:32:36,904
Do I need to dance in 
tune with your decision?

1134
01:32:37,704 --> 01:32:39,784
I have a couple of tasks to do

1135
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:43,580
Immediately after I return, 
we will leave. Got it?

1136
01:32:53,637 --> 01:32:55,557
Where are you going with baggage?

1137
01:32:59,571 --> 01:33:00,531
I need to travel, mom

1138
01:33:03,682 --> 01:33:04,305
I..

1139
01:33:06,991 --> 01:33:08,031
..will return only after some days

1140
01:33:13,558 --> 01:33:16,484
I’m confident that you 
 won’t engage in any wrong doing

1141
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:38,444
That won’t work, Raja

1142
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:40,730
I told Pappan that day itself,

1143
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:43,690
to find that guy and finish him

1144
01:33:44,603 --> 01:33:46,523
That is the only solution

1145
01:33:48,571 --> 01:33:51,048
As you know, if Moopan catches him..

1146
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:52,819
Okay..

1147
01:33:53,779 --> 01:33:55,899
Cut the phone, I will call you later

1148
01:34:00,781 --> 01:34:01,485
Oh no!

1149
01:34:09,882 --> 01:34:10,618
You!

1150
01:34:20,597 --> 01:34:21,996
You said you’re checking out,

1151
01:34:22,136 --> 01:34:22,980
but you seem to have visitors.

1152
01:34:23,156 --> 01:34:25,076
Anything benefiting us, sir?

1153
01:34:25,276 --> 01:34:25,996
Visitors?

1154
01:34:35,786 --> 01:34:36,574
What happened?

1155
01:34:45,027 --> 01:34:46,627
Where is my bag? Where is it?

1156
01:34:48,856 --> 01:34:49,776
Where is my bag, you dog?

1157
01:34:49,843 --> 01:34:51,643
Thought you can easily ditch me!

1158
01:34:55,017 --> 01:34:55,800
Sadam! Come.

1159
01:35:03,289 --> 01:35:03,925
Oh God!

1160
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:39,425
Hey..Hey..Open it man

1161
01:36:20,737 --> 01:36:22,897
Won’t it be enough if I wash my hands once?

1162
01:36:36,231 --> 01:36:37,951
It’s enough if both of you speak,

1163
01:36:38,638 --> 01:36:40,118
where my Possession is?

1164
01:36:54,738 --> 01:36:55,738
Take him...

1165
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:02,979
One witnessing a murder 
 will only feel to speak the truth!

1166
01:37:03,828 --> 01:37:06,388
Till now, my judgement in 
 that aspect has not gone wrong

1167
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:09,510
Therefore I trust your words

1168
01:37:13,589 --> 01:37:16,454
So my Possession is with Jayan, isn’t it?

1169
01:37:18,043 --> 01:37:21,894
So let’s together go to 
 where Jayan is before he flees! Move

1170
01:37:26,137 --> 01:37:26,957
Come dude!

1171
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,298
Please sir, Jayan is not at home

1172
01:37:49,415 --> 01:37:50,750
Only two ladies are there

1173
01:37:52,556 --> 01:37:53,236
Get away,

1174
01:37:54,525 --> 01:37:56,064
Sir, Please listen

1175
01:37:56,409 --> 01:37:57,369
Jayan is not here, sir

1176
01:38:05,627 --> 01:38:08,525
I don’t think I have seen 
 you when I’d come here earlier

1177
01:38:09,107 --> 01:38:10,212
Were you not here?

1178
01:38:14,361 --> 01:38:18,041
The matter is I lost plenty of my gold

1179
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:22,571
I know that is with your dad, dear

1180
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:26,496
If I need, I can call your dad and say,

1181
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:32,037
Your daughter is in my hands. 
I can say is I want my Gold.

1182
01:38:33,017 --> 01:38:34,177
You got scared?

1183
01:38:34,948 --> 01:38:35,470
Dear!

1184
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:38,564
Mom!

1185
01:38:42,508 --> 01:38:46,289
My Possession..Her dad will bring

1186
01:38:47,945 --> 01:38:50,788
Or I will finish both of you and walk away

1187
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:52,867
Come guys

1188
01:39:10,193 --> 01:39:13,633
Could’ve gone somewhere by 
train or bus much earlier!

1189
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:16,982
This is the safest place, dude.

1190
01:39:17,255 --> 01:39:18,495
Before anyone could notice us,

1191
01:39:18,593 --> 01:39:20,033
we can see them.

1192
01:39:21,318 --> 01:39:22,718
Dude! My family…

1193
01:39:22,918 --> 01:39:24,998
My mom…must be in tension now.

1194
01:39:26,568 --> 01:39:28,128
Let’s for god’s sake end this up, Chandu!

1195
01:39:28,408 --> 01:39:29,568
I’m tired,

1196
01:39:30,287 --> 01:39:32,047
running in fear like a thief!

1197
01:39:32,767 --> 01:39:34,487
Chandu! Let me tell you one thing.

1198
01:39:34,687 --> 01:39:36,687
You are playing staking both our lives!

1199
01:39:37,741 --> 01:39:40,998
We can take that from there and return it, Chandu

1200
01:39:41,834 --> 01:39:43,354
That’s not possible, dude!

1201
01:39:45,407 --> 01:39:47,367
Would you stop only after staking my life?

1202
01:39:48,818 --> 01:39:50,618
I’ve stopped! I’m not in this game anymore

1203
01:39:50,778 --> 01:39:52,298
You do what the hell you want!

1204
01:39:52,599 --> 01:39:53,479
Leave me

1205
01:39:53,618 --> 01:39:55,418
Hey Sadam! Sadam!

1206
01:39:57,010 --> 01:39:58,650
Stop..Stop I say

1207
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:00,519
Stop, listen to me

1208
01:40:00,799 --> 01:40:02,443
- Listen to me, Sadam 
- No.

1209
01:40:02,889 --> 01:40:05,089
You! I’m telling you not to go!

1210
01:40:05,436 --> 01:40:06,138
Leave..

1211
01:40:07,609 --> 01:40:08,809
You idiot!

1212
01:40:09,381 --> 01:40:13,421
Not only mine, I’m concerned 
of your life also now.

1213
01:40:19,839 --> 01:40:23,675
We must get out of this mess at any cost

1214
01:40:23,945 --> 01:40:25,932
For that, we need his help once more

1215
01:40:39,807 --> 01:40:41,087
He doesn’t know me

1216
01:40:41,449 --> 01:40:42,769
That Truck is for us

1217
01:40:43,285 --> 01:40:45,085
If I give up that Truck 
then loss is for us

1218
01:40:45,182 --> 01:40:46,045
And not for him

1219
01:41:13,574 --> 01:41:15,014
Jayan is a scoundrel!

1220
01:41:15,409 --> 01:41:18,254
I stood beside all his dirty activities.

1221
01:41:19,307 --> 01:41:24,174
When you had courage to 
face such a wicked person,

1222
01:41:24,932 --> 01:41:27,787
Shouldn’t I also show a little courage?

1223
01:41:31,089 --> 01:41:32,327
What you said was right

1224
01:41:35,042 --> 01:41:36,802
This is not Jayan’s truck anymore

1225
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:38,317
It’s your’s!

1226
01:41:40,562 --> 01:41:43,802
Jayan only knows to make. 
Never gives others!

1227
01:42:15,183 --> 01:42:18,663
Now Jayan’s enemy is neither Adiga nor Moopan

1228
01:42:19,703 --> 01:42:20,423
Its YOU!

1229
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:30,679
That bugger cheated me, didn't he?

1230
01:42:32,035 --> 01:42:32,763
Look at me!

1231
01:42:33,183 --> 01:42:34,706
After being with me..

1232
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:39,613
Before Adiga gets him, I want him

1233
01:42:50,308 --> 01:42:52,348
If Pappettan had met Jayan

1234
01:42:53,972 --> 01:42:55,667
Then, Adiga surely have met Jayan

1235
01:42:58,512 --> 01:43:00,392
So, Pappettan..

1236
01:43:02,098 --> 01:43:02,858
I..

1237
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:05,810
…have decided a few things

1238
01:43:09,074 --> 01:43:12,194
For that, I need your help

1239
01:43:22,363 --> 01:43:23,123
Tell me

1240
01:43:23,523 --> 01:43:25,855
Bro, we’ll sell the gold

1241
01:43:27,656 --> 01:43:28,736
Let’s meet the Marwadi tomorrow

1242
01:43:30,443 --> 01:43:33,964
Why not? We’ll surely meet..

1243
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,714
Tomorrow, I will let you know the place, okay

1244
01:44:26,079 --> 01:44:26,759
Bro!

1245
01:44:28,782 --> 01:44:29,587
Where is the Gold?

1246
01:44:29,954 --> 01:44:32,074
This is not a safe place, let’s scoot

1247
01:44:33,795 --> 01:44:34,703
Follow me

1248
01:45:20,533 --> 01:45:21,853
You’re too smart!

1249
01:45:23,413 --> 01:45:24,845
Now I got your plan

1250
01:45:26,134 --> 01:45:28,054
You made him come here

1251
01:45:28,136 --> 01:45:28,936
Fantastic!

1252
01:45:29,087 --> 01:45:32,204
In certain things, you are smarter than me!

1253
01:45:44,896 --> 01:45:47,259
This is Jayan’s place!

1254
01:45:47,892 --> 01:45:49,092
Who is Adiga here?

1255
01:45:49,897 --> 01:45:52,137
Here I’m the Adiga!

1256
01:45:57,211 --> 01:45:58,852
Even I took some pain

1257
01:45:58,954 --> 01:46:01,160
So I also need a share in that

1258
01:46:01,767 --> 01:46:04,167
I will get it at any cost

1259
01:46:37,373 --> 01:46:37,975
What?

1260
01:46:37,999 --> 01:46:38,530
Sir..

1261
01:46:38,606 --> 01:46:39,827
Jayan’s truck is parked over there

1262
01:46:39,857 --> 01:46:40,545
Whose?

1263
01:46:40,731 --> 01:46:41,936
Jayan’s truck!

1264
01:46:43,183 --> 01:46:44,423
Pappaettan! Move.

1265
01:46:47,299 --> 01:46:48,179
Come take the jeep

1266
01:47:00,584 --> 01:47:01,424
Come!

1267
01:48:05,906 --> 01:48:08,106
Tell me where my gold is!

1268
01:48:48,864 --> 01:48:49,904
Adiga!!

1269
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:54,350
Playing your tricks with Jayan, rascal!

1270
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:06,567
Now the game is between us

1271
01:49:09,245 --> 01:49:11,767
Tell me where Contessa is!

1272
01:49:16,877 --> 01:49:19,917
Speak! Where is the Contessa!

1273
01:49:20,515 --> 01:49:21,408
Game is not between us

1274
01:49:21,544 --> 01:49:22,824
But between you both

1275
01:49:34,151 --> 01:49:37,271
If I have to go to Jail or lose some gold,

1276
01:49:37,589 --> 01:49:38,705
I don’t give a damn!

1277
01:49:39,971 --> 01:49:44,372
But no one will leave this place alive 
after cheating me.

1278
01:49:59,601 --> 01:50:00,401
Wait..Wait..

1279
01:50:00,718 --> 01:50:02,038
Let their programme end

1280
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:14,190
What? Is it enough for you?

1281
01:50:16,281 --> 01:50:17,801
Don’t try to become Jayan

1282
01:50:18,088 --> 01:50:19,448
And You are yet to reach that level

1283
01:50:40,114 --> 01:50:42,074
It’s enough if I be my self

1284
01:50:42,582 --> 01:50:43,542
I don’t wish to become Jayan

1285
01:50:51,888 --> 01:50:52,968
Take him away

1286
01:51:00,131 --> 01:51:01,211
Come on move

1287
01:52:44,722 --> 01:52:45,580
Dude!

1288
01:52:45,752 --> 01:52:47,409
Did you disclose this to anybody else?

1289
01:52:48,843 --> 01:52:49,564
Dude!

1290
01:53:48,464 --> 01:53:49,424
Do you’ve fear?

1291
01:53:50,362 --> 01:53:51,026
Is there fear ...?

1292
01:53:51,831 --> 01:53:53,191
Gold is in your hand!

1293
01:53:53,837 --> 01:53:54,917
That too Contessa!

1294
01:54:01,126 --> 01:54:04,206
Gold is bad. It is a killer!

1295
01:54:31,164 --> 01:54:34,930
All our efforts have gone in vain, dude!

1296
01:54:36,986 --> 01:54:38,266
Pull down the shutter and come

1297
01:55:05,047 --> 01:55:07,927
We shouldn’t have trusted that rascal

1298
01:55:08,659 --> 01:55:10,219
He should not be spared!

1299
01:55:10,563 --> 01:55:13,443
We must find him at any cost

1300
01:55:14,059 --> 01:55:15,672
That bloody Pappan!

1301
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:19,340
He needn’t enjoy it all alone after cheating us

1302
01:55:22,617 --> 01:55:27,692
We shouldn’t do anything that we feel is wrong

1303
01:55:29,086 --> 01:55:30,235
We’ve not lost anything

1304
01:55:30,874 --> 01:55:31,594
We got everything!

1305
01:55:33,055 --> 01:55:34,272
You got Laila!

1306
01:55:35,305 --> 01:55:36,491
I got mom…

1307
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:37,695
..and You!

1308
01:55:39,117 --> 01:55:42,513
Dude! Let us happily live 
like old Chandu and Sadam!

1309
01:55:43,289 --> 01:55:45,594
Taking couple of drinks…What do you say?

1310
01:55:55,672 --> 01:55:56,531
That's enough.

1311
01:56:02,063 --> 01:56:03,110
Dear Chandu!

1312
01:56:03,903 --> 01:56:06,103
This World is only for 
the one who knows to play the game

1313
01:56:06,567 --> 01:56:07,927
For being a part in this game,

1314
01:56:08,402 --> 01:56:10,322
definitely a share will reach you!

1315
01:56:10,929 --> 01:56:11,828
It’s not Jayan’s words

1316
01:56:12,462 --> 01:56:13,875
But this Pappettan’s words, my boy!

1317
01:56:13,990 --> 01:56:15,649
Mom! Let’s try for a loan,

1318
01:56:17,884 --> 01:56:19,244
and buy a Truck

1319
01:56:19,390 --> 01:56:22,891
We’ll buy it later! You first have food

1320
01:56:24,633 --> 01:56:27,313
“Tomorrow we should live like kings”

1321
01:56:27,513 --> 01:56:30,393
“Men and elephants 
should be there with us”

1322
01:56:30,553 --> 01:56:33,930
“We must roam in cars, we must buy bungalows

1323
01:56:34,102 --> 01:56:36,902
You come, you come”

1324
01:56:37,102 --> 01:56:39,662
“We must jump over hurdles like cheetahs”

1325
01:56:39,862 --> 01:56:42,542
“Without slipping, we must climb step by step”

1326
01:56:42,782 --> 01:56:46,266
“Darling should be with us with mischief in her eyes

1327
01:56:46,485 --> 01:56:48,851
You come, you come”

1328
01:56:49,391 --> 01:56:52,191
“We must climb many paths and come first,

1329
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:53,744
“Without making mistakes “

1330
01:56:53,959 --> 01:56:55,119
“With eyes and body as one”

1331
01:56:55,334 --> 01:56:56,694
“We’ll go on”

1332
01:56:56,855 --> 01:56:58,055
“We’ll go like thunder and lightning”

1333
01:56:58,248 --> 01:56:59,728
“There should be lots of money in your hands”

1334
01:56:59,849 --> 01:57:01,209
“Go forward, dude”

1335
01:57:01,316 --> 01:57:02,436
“Shouldn’t we smell

1336
01:57:02,572 --> 01:57:04,406
The fresh, crisp notes”

1337
01:57:04,673 --> 01:57:05,793
“Shouldn’t we sleep

1338
01:57:05,953 --> 01:57:07,433
keeping the bundles under our pillows”

1339
01:57:07,633 --> 01:57:08,873
“Shouldn’t we grope for them,

1340
01:57:09,113 --> 01:57:10,433
Waking up now and then”

1341
01:57:10,633 --> 01:57:11,753
To get money soon,”

1342
01:57:11,993 --> 01:57:13,393
“You come, bro”

1343
01:57:13,813 --> 01:57:15,133
“Times change, appearances change”

1344
01:57:15,373 --> 01:57:17,053
“You and I also change”

1345
01:57:20,165 --> 01:57:21,445
“Like Onam Bumper Prize

1346
01:57:21,645 --> 01:57:23,525
Luck will come tomorrow”

1347
01:57:26,405 --> 01:57:29,125
“You fight valiantly using strategy”

1348
01:57:29,325 --> 01:57:30,405
“Even if there is danger,

1349
01:57:30,565 --> 01:57:32,125
you stand without falling”

1350
01:57:32,285 --> 01:57:36,445
“Without success,

1351
01:57:36,725 --> 01:57:38,274
your journey will not end”

1352
01:57:38,469 --> 01:57:41,349
“One, two, three, four, 
Five, six, seven, eight”

1353
01:57:41,509 --> 01:57:44,309
“We want bundles of notes 
which cannot be counted”

1354
01:57:44,509 --> 01:57:46,309
“Money, money, money, 
money, if no money,

1355
01:57:46,509 --> 01:57:48,829
fall in the trap of borrowing in the palm of the rich”

1356
01:57:49,029 --> 01:57:52,555
“to get money soon, you come”
