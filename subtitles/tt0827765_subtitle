304
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:20,333

Don't be frighten Uncle You will be fine

306
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,583
Go and search

307
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:27,458
What happened? Sikandar have you saw someone running from here?

308
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:33,750
I was taking care of uncle so, did saw anyone what happened?

309
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,416
Some guy tells us about smuggling

310
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:40,458
and when we reach there, he ran with all stuffs

311
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,541
He is too clever

312
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,916
Yes, some day this cleverness will become hand cuffs for him

313
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:50,583
I guess he might be at this way ok

314
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:58,791
You will run in darkness for complete life But you will never reach me

315
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:05,166
Sikander We slum people considered you angel of nice and honesty

316
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,500
but you are a thief bad man

317
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,916
I will right way tell Amar that, you did this all

318
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:14,458
No Uncle this is false What false?

319
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:21,583
Is it not true that you are running holding this bag? Reality

320
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:26,583
Reality is that Uncle, my mother didn't die becauseof fire

321
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:31,333
One Police officer killed her Murder Yes uncle

322
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:38,333
And from that day, I connect wires to police station and get information about illegal wealth

323
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:47,666
Then I tell them about robbery and rob all wealth to give to poor people

324
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,541
because I believe, that this wealthbelongs to poor people

325
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:53,333
But son, who long you will do all this?

326
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:57,333
The day, till I didn't get killer of my mother I will irritate police department in same way

Yes, Sikandar Amar is right

460
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:07,958
The person who save life of other without thinking of own

461
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:09,458
is never less than the God

462
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:13,041
But Uncle how are you here? We went to hospital to pick you up.

463
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:15,916
And got to know about this accident We thought,

464
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:20,625
we should also go and meet the God

465
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:24,916
father, I guess Sikandar is feeling shy by hearing his appreciation

466
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:29,666
He thinks that Police man only scold and beat

467
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:33,333
That mother must be so lucky who gave birth to you

468
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:37,875
I am alone in this world No son

469
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:41,291

Shama, I feel like every police man is killer of my father

476
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:42,750

1066
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:56,541
Sikandar will kill his own father And inspector Amar will kill Sikandar

1067
02:00:57,041 --> 02:01:01,708
Boss, Ididn't understand Verma Sikandar's father?

1068
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:05,958
Yes, Sikandar is real son of Verma

1069
02:01:06,458 --> 02:01:10,875
When sikandar told me about his mother's murder

1070
02:01:11,375 --> 02:01:14,458
and he told about taking photograph of that killer

1071
02:01:14,958 --> 02:01:18,125
Then I got to know that Sikandar is real son of Verma

1072
02:01:18,625 --> 02:01:20,458
But how? That is how, because

1073
02:01:20,958 --> 02:01:26,666
15 years prior, when I went to kill Zarina bai in inspector's costume

1074
02:01:27,166 --> 02:01:33,458
Shekhu

1075
02:01:33,958 --> 02:01:38,458
That time the kid that was in her home was not Amar

1076
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:41,833
but he was Sikandar, who took the picture

1077
02:01:42,333 --> 02:01:48,291
I ran with camera And I preserve that photograph

1078
02:01:48,791 --> 02:01:53,208
To ensure that the day when Verma will be in my path

1079
02:01:53,708 --> 02:01:57,000
I will use the same photograph for his death

1080
02:01:57,500 --> 02:02:00,708
No I will not let this happen but before 1

1081
02:02:01,208 --> 02:02:04,458
5 years, court gave you death sentence

1082
02:02:04,958 --> 02:02:12,916
