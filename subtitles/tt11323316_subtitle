1
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,729
Cyrus!

2
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:53,970
I'm alright dear!

3
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:24,248
Hi Ritu...

4
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:25,487
Woke up?

5
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:29,758
I reached the conference
meet, It will start now.

6
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:32,003
It's our first
wedding anniversary!

7
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:35,295
It kills me not being there...

8
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:38,079
Anyways, I miss you so much!

9
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:39,871
I'll be back tomorrow.

10
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:44,123
If you are bored being alone,
ask Bhavana or Abi to stay over.

11
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,284
Then... Don't forget your tablets...

12
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:48,316
have food, take rest...

13
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:49,825
and avoid mood swings!

14
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,420
Ask our baby to behave nice...

15
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:55,940
and tell her Dad will
narrate her fairy tales!

16
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:57,071
Okay?

17
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,258
You got check-up at 3:30 today...

18
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:01,669
don't forget.

19
00:05:02,316 --> 00:05:04,738
Drive carefully Ritu! Okay?

20
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:07,631
Hey!

21
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,642
I miss you!

22
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:35,581
Shruthi! Please come.

23
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,717
Move aside, make some space.

24
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,833
What will I do now?

25
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:54,321
Why did you attempt suicide?
What will happen to us?

26
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:55,901
Move aside...

27
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:03,098
Near the cold sea...

28
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:05,258
several Penguins are living.

29
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:07,351
Among them, there's a Penguin...

30
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:10,241
that was having fun with
its family and friends.

31
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:14,273
The penguin then delivered
a small penguin.

32
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:18,999
The small penguin is now
the apple of her eye!

33
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:21,838
One day, the Penguin
set out farther...

34
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,693
to bring fish for the nestling.

35
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:27,933
When she was bringing
all the fish back...

36
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,517
down pour started with
heavy thunders,

37
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,424
and the mother Penguin
got injured severely.

38
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:38,590
Even then, she managed to walk back
just to see her little nestling, but...

39
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:44,058
the little penguin is caught in
the sea alone and crying aloud!

40
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,934
Mother Penguin got tensed!

41
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,679
The mother penguin can't understand
how the little one got into the sea.

42
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:52,137
But, to save her nestling...

43
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,844
she steps on the water
despite her injuries.

44
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:57,736
But, she doesn't know that
there are crocodiles...

45
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:01,172
...and piranhas in the sea that
are waiting to eat her!

46
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:02,476
Rhythm!

47
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,925
Ajju, I will be back in a minute.

48
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,730
What's up Raghu?

49
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:15,937
Bhavana...

50
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,172
Bahavana's father is no more.

51
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:29,861
Kathir, take it.

52
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:32,815
Please go inside.

53
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:39,887
His heart stopped while sleeping.

54
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,067
Come inside.

55
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:43,326
[Bhavana Mom] Please look at me

56
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:48,741
[Bhavana Mom] What am I going to do?

57
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,569
[Bhavana Mom] I can't bear the loss

58
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:59,154
[Bhavana's Mother] Rhythm is here,
you are always fond of her,

59
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:00,883
[Bhavana's mother] please
wake up and see her

60
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:03,471
We are all with you.

61
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,428
Don't think that you are alone.

62
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:13,931
You need to...

63
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:15,883
console your Mom.

64
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:18,627
Bhavana...

65
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:20,894
Bhavana...

66
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:24,841
Give her some space.

67
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,482
Where's Ajay?

68
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:40,479
He's with Kathir.

69
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:45,211
Kathir, Is Ajay there?

70
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,950
Is Ajay there?

71
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:48,710
He came with you inside.

72
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:51,565
What? But... he was there!

73
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,919
Hey... Just now he
came with you inside!

74
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,785
oh no... Raghu... Ajay is

75
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:57,593
Wait..wait!

76
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:58,685
Don't get tensed

77
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,131
Everyone's grieving, search him
without disturbing others.

78
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,919
Ajay!

79
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:10,966
Sorry... Sorry

80
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:15,782
[Bhavana Mom]What will we do without you!

81
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:21,462
Please get up!

82
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:23,868
What happened?

83
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:25,732
He's not here Raghu.

84
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,831
Did you see a boy around here
wearing a white T-shirt?

85
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:40,121
Ajay...

86
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:41,476
- Did you find him?
- Ajay is missing

87
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:42,831
- What happened?
- Ajay is missing.

88
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:44,132
Ajay is missing...

89
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,503
- Calm down.
- A few minutes back I saw him.

90
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,769
- Don't get tensed, we will search
- Don't cry, just don't cry

91
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:49,602
He should be here.

92
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:50,627
What happened?

93
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:53,595
A small kid is missing,
did you saw him here?

94
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:56,191
Hey, A kid is missing,
Search him guys.

95
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:58,273
He's a small kid, can you
check on the backyard?

96
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,466
- Sir, can you check outside?
- Sure sir.

97
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:03,024
- Please call me if you find him.
- Okay sir.

98
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,351
- Where?
- He's not here.

99
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,568
Abi, search him there.

100
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:13,955
[Bhavana Mom] What happened?

101
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,194
[Woman] Rhythm's kid is missing

102
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,457
[Bhavana's mom] Oh God!
Rhythm's son is missing!

103
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,243
[Crowd] He's not inside the house

104
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:32,661
- What happened?
- Bhavana...

105
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,839
Ajju is missing.

106
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,381
Don't panic, I
will check around.

107
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:41,202
He's nowhere to be found Raghu!

108
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:44,222
Don't say 'he is missing'...You lost him!

109
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:45,936
You are responsible for this.

110
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:47,917
If we don't find him...

111
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:48,938
I searched backside as well

112
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,552
- Isn't he inside?
- No, he isn't...

113
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,692
Ajay is here.

114
00:10:58,112 --> 00:10:59,112
Ajay

115
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:05,170
Sorry Ajju.

116
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:07,280
I won't leave you again.

117
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:09,123
Won't leave you again.

118
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,283
He's just scared!

119
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:12,815
Rhythm

120
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:16,383
Rhythm, you are next.

121
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,616
Where are you running away baby?

122
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,255
Don't roam this side.

123
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:10,547
There is a ghost
behind these walls.

124
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:11,824
It will bite you!

125
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:12,955
Okay?

126
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:15,444
Don't go near the wall.

127
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:20,983
We can hear heartbeats...

128
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,779
but the baby is not moving.

129
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:26,530
Is that a problem?

130
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,743
Baby wake... wake

131
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:31,071
Wake

132
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:32,555
Wake baby!

133
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:43,196
Looks like baby is scared.

134
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:45,815
You are already
scared of insects...

135
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,325
why did you go there?

136
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:51,059
I didn't expect that Doctor.

137
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:53,498
If the blood pressure
shoots up again,

138
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,476
it will impact oxygen
supply for the fetus.

139
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:57,586
It will put your
life also in danger.

140
00:13:57,925 --> 00:13:58,925
Doctor...

141
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,866
I'm okay if anything
bad happens to me...

142
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:02,392
...but nothing should
happen to my child.

143
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:05,621
Rhythm, your life is as important
as your child's life.

144
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:07,023
Anyways...

145
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:10,230
Just be cautious for
the next two months, okay?

146
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:13,772
Doctor?

147
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,038
Please don't tell Goutham.

148
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:17,407
He'll get tensed.

149
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:20,184
Sorry dear, I've
already informed him!

150
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:25,365
Rhythm, I know how important
this child is for you.

151
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,083
So, Personally let
me suggest you to...

152
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:30,157
avoid everything that
reminds your past.

153
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,428
Especially, Don't
go near the Lake.

154
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,445
Hi Aunty!

155
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Hi, Pavi!

156
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:13,307
Ajay is not playing with me!

157
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:14,702
Oh... Is it?

158
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,799
I will ask Ajay to play with
you for two more hours.

159
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:19,703
- Is that okay dear?
- No Aunty!

160
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:20,750
But why dear?

161
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:24,433
We heard a whistling sound
from the forest...

162
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:28,885
Ajay went into the
forest following it.

163
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,071
- When did this happened?
- Some time back.

164
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,836
But, who was there?

165
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:40,425
Charlie Chaplin Uncle, with an
umbrella was standing there...

166
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:43,221
and Ajay never returned!

167
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:56,557
AJAY!

168
00:18:58,916 --> 00:18:59,916
AJAY!

169
00:19:13,124 --> 00:19:14,489
AJAY!

170
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:38,943
AJAY...

171
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:15,486
Rhythm...

172
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:16,578
Let's search him.

173
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:28,802
AJAY!

174
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:55,523
Sir...

175
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,673
- What is it?
- Come here and see this.

176
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,943
[Doctor] She assumes insects are a
metaphor for death, hence she fears them.

177
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,708
Doctor, does this mean
she can't go outside?

178
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,339
[Doctor] No. She can move around.

179
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,536
Any treatment?

180
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,649
[Doctor] Not needed, She will be fine
if she doesn't recall those moments.

181
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,400
You got any info about Ajay?

182
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:06,745
We are still searching.

183
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,672
Sir, It's been a year...

184
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:11,330
poor kid.

185
00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:15,328
Every morning he seeks
me when he wakes up.

186
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,937
He can't bear hunger,
he'll start crying.

187
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:23,923
Don't know where
he's suffering or...

188
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:25,458
what he's doing.

189
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:30,026
Sir...

190
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:15,356
No Raghu...

191
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:18,756
No...

192
00:24:20,813 --> 00:24:21,984
I will not come...

193
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:25,719
Please...

194
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:27,829
No Raghu...

195
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:30,995
No way...

196
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:33,280
Please Raghu...

197
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:35,918
Raghu...

198
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:38,719
Raghu... Please no...

199
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:41,199
I will not come...

200
00:25:12,014 --> 00:25:13,014
I am sorry.

201
00:25:13,368 --> 00:25:14,799
I think Ajay is dead.

202
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,284
Nothing happened to him...

203
00:25:17,195 --> 00:25:18,341
and nothing will happen.

204
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:21,075
Nothing happened to him.

205
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:24,383
Nothing happened to him...

206
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,552
If I was in your place,

207
00:25:57,577 --> 00:25:59,516
I would thought about
killing myself.

208
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:01,707
But, If you are able
to cross this phase,

209
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:03,785
then life will bring
you surprises...

210
00:26:04,178 --> 00:26:05,844
and for that, you should live.

211
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:16,823
Even in the orphanage, we
haven't seen you this broken.

212
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:21,693
You were an inspiration for
everyone in the school.

213
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:24,037
So, what happened to you now?

214
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:26,840
Everyone has their
struggles dear,

215
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:29,696
Our Bhavana, she was madly in
love with a guy in college...

216
00:26:29,912 --> 00:26:32,151
But he dumped her casually
for another girl.

217
00:26:32,492 --> 00:26:35,069
Did she end her life there?
she survived.

218
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:39,549
Kathir and I, married for seven
years and we don't have a child...

219
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:41,423
But still, we didn't lose hope.

220
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:44,548
Look, this is not your end...

221
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:47,115
...you have lot more
to experience in life.

222
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:48,734
Sir... Sir... What happened?

223
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,361
He is... coming back.

224
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:54,912
I don't get you Sir, let
me call an Ambulance.

225
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:56,564
I saw him...

226
00:27:58,114 --> 00:27:59,114
Whom did you see?

227
00:28:00,563 --> 00:28:04,078
That... missing kid... I
saw the kid as well.

228
00:28:05,745 --> 00:28:06,745
Missing kid?

229
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:12,479
Sir, which kid did you saw?

230
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:15,240
Which kid, sir?

231
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:54,742
Sir, Which kid did you see?

232
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:55,767
Please tell me sir.

233
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:57,536
Sir... Which kid?

234
00:29:02,328 --> 00:29:03,328
RUN!

235
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:15,645
I took a picture of him...

236
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:18,572
Go

237
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:20,474
Go...

238
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:22,167
GO...

239
00:32:36,107 --> 00:32:38,123
- Sir...
- Yes Madam?

240
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,717
- There...
- What happened madam?

241
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:42,810
Accident... A guy...
fell from the top.

242
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,243
Hey, check if anyone's
there in the car

243
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:49,039
No Sir... someone in
blood... was dragging him...

244
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,961
Sir, no one's here.

245
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:52,274
Where Madam?

246
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:54,455
Save him... near Lake.

247
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,914
Okay, you are safe
now, calm down.

248
00:32:57,488 --> 00:33:00,118
Sir, bring her some sweet water.

249
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:01,253
- Get the bike
- Yes sir!

250
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:02,998
you stay here Madam,
we will check it out.

251
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,123
It's cold here, come
and sit inside madam.

252
00:33:11,316 --> 00:33:12,748
I want to talk to the Inspector.

253
00:33:13,764 --> 00:33:15,097
Yeah, tell me Rhythm.

254
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:18,102
Sir, a stranger near the lake
told me that he saw the kid.

255
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:19,311
Which kid?

256
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,956
He was dragged away before
revealing details...

257
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:23,700
...it should be Ajay, sir.

258
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:26,721
- Please Sir, do something.
- Rhythm!

259
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:28,178
- start the jeep.
- Please Sir.. Please

260
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:31,410
Please Sir, The guy who came
should be the kidnapper.

261
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:33,336
He should be the one
who kidnapped Ajay.

262
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,575
I don't think it's Ajay

263
00:33:34,654 --> 00:33:38,664
- No sir, he said... he saw a kid...
- Rhythm!

264
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:41,668
It can't be Ajay

265
00:33:42,622 --> 00:33:44,054
Another child is missing!

266
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:45,902
You stay there, I will come.

267
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:52,955
Dispatch a search team to West Lake.
Urgent!

268
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:56,684
There might be a connection between
the missing child and the Lake.

269
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,704
Any team near the
Lake, Respond now.

270
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:00,554
Why are you going alone
in these odd hours madam?

271
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,690
Who is missing?

272
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:09,642
Anjana, an eight year old kid.

273
00:34:09,877 --> 00:34:12,064
We are searching for
her since dawn.

274
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:16,803
Six children in these six years!

275
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:20,762
We are not sure either this is
missing case or kidnapping case.

276
00:34:21,232 --> 00:34:22,768
Atleast this child
should be found.

277
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:25,831
Inspector will be here
now, Don't worry madam.

278
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:29,814
Sir... anybody there?

279
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,175
Are you able to hear? We
are calling from Lake area

280
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,481
We found a flower bouquet with
the caption "REST IN PEACE"

281
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:41,612
Sir... it's full of flesh... and
lots of flies here.

282
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,434
Hey... Don't touch that!

283
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:53,234
Madam...!

284
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:55,507
Sir, that Lady is driving
back to the Lake.

285
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:25,108
Goutham...

286
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:28,099
Ritu, I'm back, On my way to the
checkpost along with the Inspector.

287
00:35:28,124 --> 00:35:31,456
Goutham, I'm going to Lake. I think
the same guy kidnapped our Ajay

288
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:34,840
Ritu, Don't be adamant,
just go back to check-post.

289
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:37,419
No Goutham... I'm sure Ajay is with...

290
00:37:30,627 --> 00:37:31,627
Ajay...

291
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:05,521
Open your mouth!

292
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:16,241
Did he talk?

293
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,502
No doctor.

294
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:18,942
Okay.

295
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,673
I'm so happy dear.

296
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:29,331
Ajay!

297
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:31,846
How are you?

298
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:33,407
Do you remember me?

299
00:38:36,456 --> 00:38:37,237
He's got...

300
00:38:37,262 --> 00:38:38,747
touch discomfort.

301
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:41,104
He didn't allow any
nurses to touch him.

302
00:38:41,912 --> 00:38:43,245
He's very disturbed.

303
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:46,392
I've gone through
all the reports.

304
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:49,279
We observed him for
the past 18 hours...

305
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:52,094
but he hasn't uttered a word.

306
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:54,522
- Nurse
- Yes Doctor?

307
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:57,356
- Prepare the reports for Police.
- Sure

308
00:38:57,407 --> 00:38:59,428
Did Ajay said anything?

309
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:01,548
She's Anjana's mother.

310
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,448
Doctor... is still checking him

311
00:39:08,204 --> 00:39:09,974
Can you please ask Ajay...

312
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:12,941
whether he saw my daughter?

313
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:18,751
Madam, We are enquiring,
please hold yourself.

314
00:39:18,986 --> 00:39:20,262
But Sir...

315
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:24,662
she's just a kid, she
can't even bear hunger

316
00:39:24,689 --> 00:39:27,501
- When she wakes up...
- When he wakes up, he seeks me first.

317
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:31,278
He can't bear hunger,
he will start crying.

318
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:35,096
We will find her soon, Madam.

319
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:36,430
Let's go Madam.

320
00:39:38,955 --> 00:39:40,155
Just one minute...

321
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,179
This... is my daughter.

322
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,867
She was wearing the same
dress when she went missing.

323
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:55,627
Can you please ask
about her whereabouts?

324
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,170
My daughter...

325
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:08,371
will be found soon.

326
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:11,591
It's a blessing that
you got the kid back.

327
00:40:15,003 --> 00:40:17,711
When you ignored me and
went to the lake...

328
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:21,819
I really got mad at
you for first time.

329
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:24,900
But...

330
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:27,580
when you stood there
with your son,

331
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,279
I was stunned by your
belief all these years!

332
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:32,466
I'm so happy for you Rhythm.

333
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,873
We have to inform Ajay's father as well.

334
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:50,098
Ajay?

335
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:56,518
- Hi Raghu
- Hi

336
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:09,071
Ajay...

337
00:41:27,378 --> 00:41:28,229
Is that Ajay?

338
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:30,417
Yes, the DNA matches.

339
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:32,794
Why is he like this?

340
00:41:36,883 --> 00:41:38,966
He got thinning in the
right ankle bone.

341
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:42,220
I think his legs were
tied to a rusted chain.

342
00:41:43,524 --> 00:41:44,904
He's not salivating at all...

343
00:41:45,284 --> 00:41:46,794
because his saliva
glands are dry.

344
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,398
I'm not sure what he was eating...

345
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:52,314
and that could be the
reason for his tooth stains.

346
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:57,003
Also, he should have been
stayed in a dark room...

347
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:59,475
that's why his skin is pale.

348
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:02,152
His nails got lots of sawdust...

349
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:04,390
and I sent those samples
to you Inspector.

350
00:42:04,423 --> 00:42:05,206
Okay Doctor.

351
00:42:05,987 --> 00:42:09,424
Ajay's body got lots of
scratches and scars...

352
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:12,695
He has suffered a lot.

353
00:42:13,582 --> 00:42:17,027
Since his arrival, he hasn't
spoken a single word...

354
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:18,052
not even a sound...

355
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,207
and didn't even shed a tear!

356
00:42:19,232 --> 00:42:20,232
Importantly...

357
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:22,279
he's not scared at all!

358
00:42:24,805 --> 00:42:29,875
The guy who did this to him didn't
even consider his tender age, so...

359
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:31,992
He's definitely a ruthless monster.

360
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:36,831
All Ajay needs now is...

361
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,253
good food and lots of care.

362
00:42:41,805 --> 00:42:43,316
Leave him alone for a few days.

363
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:45,097
Give him space.

364
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:50,476
He will take time to socialize.

365
00:42:52,977 --> 00:42:54,826
Who tortured Ajay this way?

366
00:42:55,764 --> 00:42:58,107
To find that, either we
need to find Anjana or...

367
00:42:58,132 --> 00:42:59,748
Ajay should start talking.

368
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,212
- Inspector
- Yes Doctor?

369
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:02,905
Can you collect the reports now?

370
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:03,930
Okay Doctor.

371
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,269
Goutham, please come.

372
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:16,654
Don't get confused, we got him back!

373
00:43:18,293 --> 00:43:20,195
Hey, I'm so happy dear.

374
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:22,424
Kathir will be
delighted to hear it.

375
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:24,845
Hey, let this be a surprise to Kathir.

376
00:43:25,756 --> 00:43:27,545
I will go and prepare room for Ajay

377
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:28,397
Let us help you.

378
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:33,647
Bhavana, you take Rhythm
to Ajay's ward and wait there,

379
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,095
I will give a call
when we are done.

380
00:43:39,689 --> 00:43:41,981
Fine, let me go and
settle the bill.

381
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:46,013
You should have cared
more when he was alive!

382
00:43:47,784 --> 00:43:50,466
Now with your grief
you are killing me!

383
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:03,826
You should have been
careful in watching him!

384
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,637
You are not worthy
to raise a kid!

385
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:21,371
Let's split Rhythm!

386
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:24,371
Let's end this here.

387
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,260
How long are you pregnant?

388
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,212
Seventh month.

389
00:44:49,157 --> 00:44:50,157
How many kids you have?

390
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,024
No, I'm not married yet.

391
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,618
Sorry...

392
00:45:06,718 --> 00:45:08,098
Sorry... for everything.

393
00:45:17,455 --> 00:45:18,455
Raghu...

394
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,980
Who is going to
take care of Ajay?

395
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:22,005
Rhythm will take care.

396
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:24,712
Okay fine, I will complete
the procedure accordingly.

397
00:45:28,932 --> 00:45:31,759
Ajay should be
with you... Always!

398
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:45,770
What a beautiful weather today and hope it
extends tomorrow to welcome Mystic Carnival!

399
00:45:45,795 --> 00:45:49,961
We expect people from 6 to 60 year
old for this annual festival!

400
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,514
It will be full of smiling and happy faces,

401
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:55,301
so get ready lots of fun
and excitement folks!

402
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,253

with this song and I hope you do...

did you sing?

455
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:17,039
Are you sure?

456
00:53:18,098 --> 00:53:19,098
Is this it?

457
00:53:19,438 --> 00:53:22,354
Yes Doctor, this is what
I see in my dreams.

458
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:24,437
But, how did he sketch that?

459
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:30,323
His random sketches just matched
your dream, that's it.

460
00:53:31,286 --> 00:53:32,535
Don't take it too seriously.

461
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:36,416
But, when I see this...

462
00:53:38,828 --> 00:53:41,406
it looks like reflections
of his thoughts.

463
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:44,400
I think he's trying to communicate
through these sketches.

464
00:53:47,188 --> 00:53:48,188
So...

465
00:53:48,281 --> 00:53:53,557
What do you think about this sketch?
A guy standing near the window!

466
00:53:55,287 --> 00:53:57,997
He should have imagined that...

467
00:53:58,022 --> 00:54:01,094
the Kidnapper is stalking him,

468
00:54:01,632 --> 00:54:02,632
Or...

469
00:54:02,725 --> 00:54:05,537
the kidnapper might
have paid him a visit.

470
00:54:06,006 --> 00:54:10,042
I can only give further inputs
only if he sketches again.

471
00:54:10,276 --> 00:54:11,760
Why don't you ask
him about this?

472
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:13,972
They tried to make him speak...

473
00:54:14,053 --> 00:54:15,276
but he's non-responsive.

474
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:17,021
I told you that he
sang last night.

475
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,262
Ajju!

476
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,541
Can you sing the rhymes again?

477
00:54:22,687 --> 00:54:24,327
Ajju... Please.

478
00:54:24,352 --> 00:54:26,513
Everybody assumes that
your mom is lying...

479
00:54:26,538 --> 00:54:28,204
Ajju... Look here...

480
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,536
Ajju..Look at your mom...

481
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:32,061
Relax... Relax dear!

482
00:54:32,296 --> 00:54:33,696
Let's do one thing,

483
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,722
If he sings again...

484
00:54:35,747 --> 00:54:38,116
you record it and we
will all get a clarity.

485
00:54:38,638 --> 00:54:39,638
At this time...

486
00:54:40,461 --> 00:54:43,042
Don't strain yourself with
unwarranted thoughts.

487
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:44,067
You need to rest!

488
00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:45,315
See you.

489
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:47,963
Ajay, bye!

490
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:53,139
Okay Rhythm, I will drop him off.

491
00:55:04,098 --> 00:55:05,295
Yes, Raghu?

492
00:55:05,994 --> 00:55:07,560
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

493
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:12,014
I thought of meetingAjay before I leave.

494
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,748
You can come home.

495
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,478
No..No...

496
00:55:16,274 --> 00:55:18,826
I feel uncomfortable
to come home...

497
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,588
so, shall we meet outside?

498
00:55:24,504 --> 00:55:25,883
Okay, Where?

499
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,461
Ajju, where were you
all these days?

500
00:56:24,403 --> 00:56:26,684
How you got all these scars?

501
00:56:29,638 --> 00:56:31,513
Anjana is also pitiful like you.

502
00:56:32,503 --> 00:56:34,184
She could be
suffering somewhere,

503
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:36,616
Who did this to you dear?

504
00:56:41,867 --> 00:56:42,867
Thank you!

505
00:57:00,565 --> 00:57:04,669
He should have imagined that
the kidnapper is stalking him

506
00:57:04,694 --> 00:57:07,845
Or the kidnapper might
have paid him a visit.

507
00:57:20,425 --> 00:57:21,425
Ajju!

508
00:57:28,851 --> 00:57:31,429
Ajju... is there
anyone behind me?

509
00:57:34,867 --> 00:57:36,455
Is it the Kidnapper?

510
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:18,748
Ajay, come.

511
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:44,814
There was a guy in that table...

512
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:46,558
- There?
- Yeah, did you see him?

513
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,610
I didn't notice madam.

514
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,683
- Any orders placed from that table?
- No madam.

515
00:58:50,673 --> 00:58:52,755
- Is there any other exit here?
- No madam.

516
00:59:25,484 --> 00:59:27,491
Cyrus, Stay!

517
01:00:35,105 --> 01:00:37,475
I asked you to wait inside!
What are you doing here?

518
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:39,860
Raghu! The Kidnapper
is in this crowd.

519
01:00:41,448 --> 01:00:42,256
Here?

520
01:00:42,282 --> 01:00:44,338
Let's go somewhere
and discuss, come.

521
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:45,389
Raghu!

522
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:50,833
Ajay!

523
01:00:51,474 --> 01:00:53,208
Rhythm, what happened?

524
01:00:53,314 --> 01:00:53,964
Ajay is gone!

525
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:55,421
He took off into the crowd

526
01:00:55,446 --> 01:00:56,446
Ajay!

527
01:00:56,793 --> 01:00:57,793
AJAY!

528
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:00,059
Ajay...

529
01:01:01,168 --> 01:01:02,168
AJAY...

530
01:01:05,543 --> 01:01:06,543
AJAY!

531
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:09,252
Ajay...

532
01:01:09,918 --> 01:01:10,918
Cyrus...

533
01:01:13,656 --> 01:01:14,656
Ajay!

534
01:01:15,257 --> 01:01:17,470
CYRUS...

535
01:01:20,257 --> 01:01:21,257
Ajay...

536
01:01:53,132 --> 01:01:54,132
Ajay

537
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:59,902
I'm here... You are safe!

538
01:02:01,374 --> 01:02:02,728
Ajju... Ajju

539
01:02:02,846 --> 01:02:03,991
What's happening here?

540
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,064
Why did he run away from you?

541
01:02:07,089 --> 01:02:08,877
The kidnapper came by
the house yesterday.

542
01:02:09,382 --> 01:02:12,471
He followed us here as
well, that's why Ajay ran.

543
01:02:13,366 --> 01:02:14,537
I thought Ajay is safe!

544
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:17,729
Why would the
kidnapper come again?

545
01:02:19,006 --> 01:02:21,219
Cover... where's the cover.

546
01:02:29,137 --> 01:02:30,204
What's it Raghu?

547
01:02:34,396 --> 01:02:35,396
Goutham photos.

548
01:02:39,387 --> 01:02:40,787
Where is Goutham now?

549
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:43,710
- Tell me
- He's at home.

550
01:02:44,049 --> 01:02:45,049
Call him...

551
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:47,615
no time to think, just call him.

552
01:02:48,656 --> 01:02:49,958
What if it was Goutham?

553
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:52,563
Why would he leave his own
pictures on the cover?

554
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:56,365
Also, If that's the case, Ajay
would have reacted seeing Goutham.

555
01:02:57,043 --> 01:02:59,272
You can't conclude anything
from these pictures.

556
01:02:59,297 --> 01:03:02,068
I know him well,
It can't be him.

557
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:05,053
The kidnapper is somewhere else.

558
01:03:13,517 --> 01:03:15,027
Take me to the place
where you found Ajay...

559
01:03:15,938 --> 01:03:17,527
We will find all
the answers there!

560
01:03:27,959 --> 01:03:30,026
Do you want to know
who kidnapped?

561
01:03:30,823 --> 01:03:31,943
Ajay will show you now.

562
01:03:59,455 --> 01:04:00,965
He is agitated.

563
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:03,960
Please stop this Raghu.

564
01:04:05,704 --> 01:04:07,292
Don't push him.

565
01:04:23,508 --> 01:04:25,357
He's not scared to
go inside, but...

566
01:04:25,382 --> 01:04:26,797
...he's not ready to snitch.

567
01:04:28,272 --> 01:04:29,938
Ajay was with us for
two years only,

568
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:31,613
but with kidnapper, he spent...

569
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:32,744
SIX YEARS!

570
01:04:33,608 --> 01:04:35,691
Naturally, he's inclined
towards Kidnapper.

571
01:04:38,451 --> 01:04:40,534
He won't reveal, even
if the kidnapper is...

572
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,624
in front of him

573
01:04:48,011 --> 01:04:49,011
What if...

574
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,828
Ajay prefers to stay
with Kidnapper?

575
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,186
No..No way...

576
01:04:57,036 --> 01:05:00,264
Whomsoever he spent
time with, he's my son!

577
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:04,222
You are blinded by love,

578
01:05:04,641 --> 01:05:05,942
he's my son as well.

579
01:05:07,582 --> 01:05:09,118
But, think practically...

580
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,854
All these are assumptions!

581
01:05:15,697 --> 01:05:16,697
Fine...

582
01:05:17,103 --> 01:05:18,483
Did we find Ajay?

583
01:05:19,343 --> 01:05:21,076
No, he came on his own.

584
01:05:23,249 --> 01:05:24,759
What if he got other plans?

585
01:05:47,848 --> 01:05:49,905
Champ... put that down.

586
01:05:52,499 --> 01:05:53,499
Put that DOWN!

587
01:05:56,613 --> 01:05:57,613
JUST DROP IT!

588
01:07:32,377 --> 01:07:34,798
Relax... Relax

589
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,093
We are at your home only

590
01:07:37,899 --> 01:07:40,945
I tried reaching Goutham,
but no response.

591
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:43,757
That's why I called Ambulance
and accompanied you.

592
01:07:45,009 --> 01:07:45,712
Ajay?

593
01:07:46,026 --> 01:07:47,026
He's inside.

594
01:07:48,619 --> 01:07:50,675
I don't know whom to suspect!

595
01:07:53,098 --> 01:07:55,467
but, I'm sure his
childhood is not happy.

596
01:07:57,551 --> 01:07:59,842
Physically, he's still a kid...

597
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,392
but mentally, I don't know.

598
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,420
I don't know what he's thinking...

599
01:08:07,168 --> 01:08:09,417
I don't know how he reacts...

600
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:11,109
He's so unpredictable.

601
01:08:11,472 --> 01:08:14,743
Please don't mistake
me for saying this...

602
01:08:14,768 --> 01:08:16,087
If you don't feel safe...

603
01:08:16,915 --> 01:08:18,087
Call me immediately!

604
01:08:18,817 --> 01:08:21,577
I wish to meet the kidnapper...

605
01:08:23,686 --> 01:08:26,654
and want to ask him why
he did this to my son.

606
01:08:27,842 --> 01:08:29,743
He will get caught soon...

607
01:08:30,766 --> 01:08:32,380
and you will ask him the same.

608
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:37,410
I'll leave now.

609
01:08:39,707 --> 01:08:41,425
- Take care
- One minute.

610
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,243
Ajay haven't responded to anyone but...

611
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:50,306
he threw the stick the
moment you commanded him.

612
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,400
Why?

613
01:08:54,473 --> 01:08:55,473
I don't know.

614
01:08:56,504 --> 01:08:57,504
Maybe...

615
01:08:57,858 --> 01:09:00,774
the kidnapper might have
trained him by commanding.

616
01:09:01,374 --> 01:09:03,587
So he might have responded
when I commanded him.

617
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:06,467
We will see tomorrow, bye.

636
01:15:18,176 --> 01:15:19,709
- What happened?
- Cyrus

637
01:15:21,926 --> 01:15:24,530
Nothing..he's been sedated.

638
01:15:24,555 --> 01:15:25,555

There's a shiver in his voice.

643
01:15:43,617 --> 01:15:46,611
It sounds like a cry for help.

644
01:15:47,731 --> 01:15:48,903
The guy who came...

645
01:15:50,205 --> 01:15:52,471
spoke in sign language.

646
01:15:54,164 --> 01:15:55,569
Okay... Ajay...

647
01:15:58,564 --> 01:15:59,564
Hello

648
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:02,278
My name is

649
01:16:03,034 --> 01:16:06,393
D - A - V - I - D

650
01:16:08,006 --> 01:16:10,325
What is your name?

651
01:16:14,232 --> 01:16:18,606
If you understand, nod your head

652
01:16:20,836 --> 01:16:23,413
This doesn't look like
normal sign language.

653
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,058
It looks like a secret
communication between them.

654
01:16:29,013 --> 01:16:30,013
He needs help.

655
01:16:32,007 --> 01:16:35,757
If he can sing, then why
isn't he speaking normally?

656
01:16:36,148 --> 01:16:37,148
Stress...

657
01:16:37,971 --> 01:16:39,497
Either he should cry or...

658
01:16:39,991 --> 01:16:41,553
should shout out in anger.

659
01:16:42,803 --> 01:16:46,396
Only in his prime emotion,
he will be able to speak

660
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:48,010
But most importantly...

661
01:16:48,245 --> 01:16:53,036
He should trust at least one
person with unshakeable faith.

662
01:16:54,601 --> 01:16:55,601
Isn't it Ajay?

663
01:16:58,508 --> 01:16:59,757
No one's around your house.

664
01:17:00,982 --> 01:17:04,731
But let's not risk it, I will
leave a constable for a watch.

665
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:09,408
Please search around the
place where he was found.

666
01:17:09,513 --> 01:17:11,778
This forest is 1000
square kilometers vast...

667
01:17:11,803 --> 01:17:13,938
In fact we are right
in the middle of it.

668
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,551
So, where do we start?

669
01:17:15,576 --> 01:17:18,362
He's out there alive which put every
children in this town at risk.

670
01:17:18,387 --> 01:17:21,147
Don't think about it,
let them do their job.

671
01:17:21,622 --> 01:17:23,653
Call me if you need
anything, take care.

672
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,547
Don't waste your time
on sign language,

673
01:17:28,304 --> 01:17:30,179
Take him to a good
speech therapist.

674
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:34,189
don't worry, I will fix an appointment.

675
01:17:35,768 --> 01:17:36,768
Doctor...

676
01:17:37,513 --> 01:17:39,491
...shall we leave?
See you Goutham.

677
01:17:40,429 --> 01:17:42,773
I couldn't see Kathir
at all, Where is he?

678
01:17:43,257 --> 01:17:46,903
He went on a business trip, He's
not even reachable on the phone.

679
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:48,621
He doesn't know about Ajay yet.

680
01:17:50,731 --> 01:17:51,731
Kids?

681
01:17:54,117 --> 01:17:55,117
Not yet Raghu.

682
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:56,929
I'm taking medications.

683
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:58,704
We are still trying.

684
01:17:59,533 --> 01:18:00,080
Abi!

685
01:18:00,105 --> 01:18:02,371
Will you ask him to call
me when he reaches you?

686
01:18:02,632 --> 01:18:04,585
- Abi, shall we go?
- Yeah, I'm coming.

687
01:18:05,224 --> 01:18:06,291
Just relax dear.

688
01:18:07,596 --> 01:18:09,731
Hopefully, you will
get answers soon.

689
01:18:11,085 --> 01:18:12,085
Take care.

690
01:18:16,606 --> 01:18:18,012
- Bye Goutham
- Bye

691
01:18:24,601 --> 01:18:25,601
Goutham

692
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,013
I know you hate me,

693
01:18:33,445 --> 01:18:36,726
Four years back, I spilled the
words without empathy at her.

694
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:39,736
and the relationship
ended there.

695
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:44,450
My presence now is only
for Ajay and no one else.

696
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,444
The moment I find what
happened to him, I will leave.

697
01:18:48,147 --> 01:18:49,147
Don't worry!

698
01:18:52,054 --> 01:18:53,382
You've got a good family Goutham.

699
01:18:55,336 --> 01:18:56,336
Take care.

700
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:01,603
I'm sorry Goutham.

701
01:19:09,256 --> 01:19:14,438
Goutham, I think the kidnapper is following
Ajay and threatening him with something...

702
01:19:14,545 --> 01:19:19,388
I think... that's why Ajay is not talking.

703
01:19:19,715 --> 01:19:22,527
He will talk today, Just wait for sometime.

704
01:19:30,627 --> 01:19:32,960
You wait here, I
will check it out.

705
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,881
Cyrus, No.

706
01:19:46,397 --> 01:19:47,699
CYRUS... NO

707
01:19:57,533 --> 01:19:58,666
Please move aside

708
01:19:58,925 --> 01:20:00,643
Madam..Madam..

709
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:03,046
Madam, get up please.

710
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,450
- What happened?
- She fainted.

711
01:20:05,164 --> 01:20:06,673
Madam, get up...

712
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:08,158
...let's go to the hospital.

713
01:20:08,237 --> 01:20:10,007
Auto... Somebody please call an Auto.

714
01:20:10,345 --> 01:20:11,986
Sir, we have a vehicle here.

715
01:20:12,065 --> 01:20:13,784
You take Ajay, I will go
to the hospital with her.

716
01:20:14,487 --> 01:20:15,553
Lift her please.

717
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:18,002
Careful... Just careful.

718
01:20:46,472 --> 01:20:47,472
Cyrus!

719
01:20:50,873 --> 01:20:51,873
Cyrus...

720
01:20:54,675 --> 01:20:57,643
Brother... Did you see a
dog with a red collar?

721
01:20:58,372 --> 01:21:01,757
There's a black dog near
the garbage, check it out.

722
01:21:01,808 --> 01:21:03,006
- There?
- Yes Madam.

723
01:21:07,059 --> 01:21:09,351
Cyrus, What are you doing here?

724
01:21:10,029 --> 01:21:11,669
I should not let
you off the hook.

725
01:21:14,638 --> 01:21:15,638
Come.

726
01:21:16,044 --> 01:21:17,294
Cyrus, I'm going to thrash you.

727
01:21:18,285 --> 01:21:19,285
Cyrus...

728
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,153
What's there?

729
01:22:05,871 --> 01:22:06,871
Cyrus

730
01:22:13,675 --> 01:22:14,675
Cyrus

731
01:22:43,516 --> 01:22:44,516
Cyrus...

732
01:23:21,347 --> 01:23:22,347
Hi Doctor!

733
01:23:25,061 --> 01:23:26,061
Hi.

734
01:23:29,644 --> 01:23:32,768
Car break-down, Goutham
went to ask for help.

735
01:23:33,056 --> 01:23:37,561
I become little dizzy, that's
why knocked your house...

736
01:23:37,586 --> 01:23:38,586
Wait Cyrus.

737
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:41,528
Can I have some water?

738
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:48,332
Doctor, can I have some water?

739
01:23:49,806 --> 01:23:52,071
Yes... Sure... Come.

740
01:24:18,872 --> 01:24:20,188
Welcome Ajay.

741
01:24:46,731 --> 01:24:48,517
That's an interesting
painting, right?

742
01:24:49,741 --> 01:24:52,267
There's a lot of history behind this.

743
01:24:54,194 --> 01:24:55,939
Doctor, Are you staying alone?

744
01:24:56,903 --> 01:24:57,970
In loneliness...

745
01:24:58,847 --> 01:25:00,279
it's different from being alone.

746
01:25:03,413 --> 01:25:04,413
Water.

747
01:25:05,966 --> 01:25:07,320
Hot water.

748
01:25:07,893 --> 01:25:09,429
I think you need coffee.

749
01:25:10,226 --> 01:25:12,152
You look tired. One minute.

750
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:31,892
Go

751
01:25:37,351 --> 01:25:38,351
Cyrus...

752
01:26:16,549 --> 01:26:17,825
Coffee smells nice.

753
01:26:19,285 --> 01:26:20,285
It's homemade.

754
01:26:22,357 --> 01:26:23,491
Thank you doctor.

755
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:29,377
I will book a cab, will
leave once it arrives.

756
01:26:29,664 --> 01:26:30,664
Okay.

757
01:26:33,246 --> 01:26:34,246
Cyrus...

758
01:26:38,663 --> 01:26:40,277
Mom can't stretch further dear.

759
01:26:44,341 --> 01:26:45,773
Doctor... If you don't mind

760
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,960
can you take Cyrus for a walk?

761
01:26:49,733 --> 01:26:50,733
Please...

762
01:26:51,909 --> 01:26:54,018
Yeah... sure.

763
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:57,378
Thank you.

764
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:14,112
Ajay... Stay here.

765
01:29:26,531 --> 01:29:27,531
Run!

766
01:30:23,564 --> 01:30:24,564
Anjana...

767
01:30:24,970 --> 01:30:25,970
Anjana...

768
01:30:31,391 --> 01:30:33,995
Ajay... Don't come here, get out.

769
01:30:36,028 --> 01:30:37,028
Anjana...

770
01:30:38,397 --> 01:30:42,021
Anjana, wake up.

771
01:30:43,683 --> 01:30:44,683
You are alright

772
01:31:23,725 --> 01:31:25,599
Why would you come here Rhythm?

773
01:31:31,172 --> 01:31:33,280
Ajju... get out.

774
01:31:36,189 --> 01:31:37,189
AJJU...

775
01:32:00,553 --> 01:32:01,553
Cyrus...

776
01:32:06,412 --> 01:32:07,792
Cyrus... No Cyrus...

777
01:32:09,146 --> 01:32:10,760
Cyrus... stay calm.

778
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:12,698
STAY!

779
01:32:12,723 --> 01:32:13,723
Don't leave him Cyrus.

780
01:32:15,343 --> 01:32:16,905
No..No..

781
01:32:18,349 --> 01:32:20,301
Stay, Stay Cyrus.

782
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:25,161
Rhythm...

783
01:32:25,829 --> 01:32:28,511
Cyrus... Good boy... good boy.
No..no...

784
01:32:28,563 --> 01:32:29,630
Don't leave him.

785
01:32:29,829 --> 01:32:30,829
Cyrus stay!

786
01:32:37,042 --> 01:32:38,042
Rhythm...

787
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:39,269
Cyrus stay there!

788
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:40,490
Cyrus...

789
01:32:46,886 --> 01:32:47,886
CYRUS!

790
01:32:57,186 --> 01:32:58,186
Ajay...

791
01:33:10,313 --> 01:33:11,313
Doctor...

792
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:13,750
Please...

793
01:33:14,026 --> 01:33:15,026
Leave him.

794
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:19,140
Please.

795
01:33:23,506 --> 01:33:25,173
Ajju, come to mom...

796
01:33:28,427 --> 01:33:29,427
Ajju...

797
01:33:30,172 --> 01:33:31,422
Ajju... come here.

798
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:44,049
Throw that away!

799
01:33:46,341 --> 01:33:47,341
STOP!

800
01:33:50,325 --> 01:33:51,325
Hold it tight!

801
01:33:52,357 --> 01:33:53,357
Ajay...

802
01:33:54,597 --> 01:33:55,769
I'm your friend, right?

803
01:33:55,976 --> 01:33:56,976
Slash him!

804
01:34:05,419 --> 01:34:06,419
Ajay...

805
01:34:07,815 --> 01:34:09,012
I say...

806
01:34:09,507 --> 01:34:10,507
DROP!

807
01:34:19,498 --> 01:34:21,867
Ajay... it's fine.. nothing
happened..look at mom

808
01:34:21,892 --> 01:34:22,892
Ajay...

809
01:34:31,997 --> 01:34:32,997
Ajay...

810
01:34:52,272 --> 01:34:53,287
Why?

811
01:34:53,446 --> 01:34:55,632
Why Rhythm... Why?

812
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,020
Ajay...

813
01:35:06,235 --> 01:35:08,864
This is a special place Rhythm!

814
01:35:08,904 --> 01:35:09,904
Let's leave...

815
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:12,105
I told you...

816
01:35:12,955 --> 01:35:14,413
not to come here.

817
01:35:21,919 --> 01:35:22,920
Doctor.

818
01:35:33,415 --> 01:35:34,415
Come Ajay...

819
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:36,539
Rhythm... Rhythm...

820
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:38,805
Rhythm... Rhythm...

821
01:37:39,756 --> 01:37:41,839
He's injured!

822
01:37:43,089 --> 01:37:44,489
You go to hospital...

823
01:37:44,756 --> 01:37:45,719
I need to go to the station.

824
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:47,073
I told you I will
take care of it.

825
01:37:47,568 --> 01:37:48,568
No...

826
01:37:49,417 --> 01:37:51,526
I want to know why
he kidnapped my son.

827
01:38:06,102 --> 01:38:08,524
How long do you plan
to keep quiet, doctor?

828
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:10,873
You have to speak,

829
01:38:11,562 --> 01:38:12,562
Why all these?

830
01:38:14,382 --> 01:38:16,543
Don't take my patience
for granted...

831
01:38:17,004 --> 01:38:18,280
I know other methods too.

832
01:38:21,316 --> 01:38:22,670
I want to talk to Rhythm.

833
01:38:22,695 --> 01:38:24,699
No... You must talk only to me.

834
01:38:24,858 --> 01:38:26,446
Trust me Inspector.

835
01:38:27,853 --> 01:38:30,821
You will definitely get lots
of interesting information.

836
01:38:41,915 --> 01:38:43,451
Why do you want to talk to me?

837
01:38:45,081 --> 01:38:46,539
To ask a few questions.

838
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:49,873
Because the unasked
questions become...

839
01:38:50,446 --> 01:38:52,659
the unsolvable puzzles!

840
01:38:54,014 --> 01:38:55,159
Why did you kidnap Ajay?

841
01:38:57,102 --> 01:38:58,872
What you did to him for
the past six years?

842
01:38:59,707 --> 01:39:01,529
Shall we play a GAME, Rhythm?

843
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:08,430
If you play till the end, all
your questions will be answered.

844
01:39:09,004 --> 01:39:10,004
But...

845
01:39:10,071 --> 01:39:12,883
If you quit in between,
you get nothing.

846
01:39:18,065 --> 01:39:19,065
What is the Game?

847
01:39:19,827 --> 01:39:21,753
The name is ONE-FOR-ONE

848
01:39:22,535 --> 01:39:25,633
You need to answer all
my questions honestly!

849
01:39:26,259 --> 01:39:27,743
I will also do the same...

850
01:39:28,082 --> 01:39:29,082
Simple!

851
01:39:30,712 --> 01:39:32,040
But without rules...

852
01:39:32,534 --> 01:39:34,305
The game will not be interesting.

853
01:39:34,488 --> 01:39:36,441
I will say this once!

854
01:39:36,858 --> 01:39:38,029
Rule number 1:

855
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,269
Each can ask one
question at a time...

856
01:39:40,764 --> 01:39:42,821
and upon answering, can
move to next question.

857
01:39:42,967 --> 01:39:44,165
Rule Number 2:

858
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,899
We shouldn't ask each
other the same question.

859
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,514
Rule number 3:

860
01:39:48,722 --> 01:39:53,423
If you answer "I don't
know", then the game ends!

861
01:39:53,448 --> 01:39:54,358
Shall we start?

862
01:39:57,149 --> 01:39:59,518
Shall I ask the first question?

863
01:39:59,571 --> 01:40:00,571
Of course!

864
01:40:01,004 --> 01:40:03,269
- Why did you kidnap...
- Your turn is over!

865
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,722
You asked, "Shall I ask?"
and that's counted!

866
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:10,196
Rules are Rules!

867
01:40:11,993 --> 01:40:13,190
Now it's my turn!

868
01:40:13,858 --> 01:40:15,368
My first question...

869
01:40:15,837 --> 01:40:18,442
Do you know why I
want to talk to you?

870
01:40:18,545 --> 01:40:23,380
Because I caught you when
no one ever doubted you.

871
01:40:23,571 --> 01:40:25,029
Why did you kidnap Ajay?

872
01:40:25,447 --> 01:40:26,714
What is this Rhythm!

873
01:40:27,217 --> 01:40:29,406
You struggled and found Anjana as well...

874
01:40:29,431 --> 01:40:31,279
but why selfishly do
you ask about Ajay?

875
01:40:31,383 --> 01:40:33,909
You wouldn't be here
if I acted selfishly!

876
01:40:35,967 --> 01:40:38,284
- Who died in the Lake?
- I don't know him!

877
01:40:39,498 --> 01:40:43,248
He saw me while kidnapping Anjana,
so I had to kill him.

878
01:40:43,769 --> 01:40:45,227
Witness clearance!

879
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:47,154
How did you find me?

880
01:40:48,195 --> 01:40:50,374
I didn't find you...

881
01:40:50,383 --> 01:40:51,383
It was Cyrus!

882
01:40:51,998 --> 01:40:52,998
Cyrus?

883
01:40:54,368 --> 01:40:55,368
The dog?

884
01:40:58,118 --> 01:40:59,758
Nasty error on my side!

885
01:41:02,405 --> 01:41:03,405
Proceed!

886
01:41:03,811 --> 01:41:05,269
Why did you kidnap Anjana?

887
01:41:05,374 --> 01:41:08,602
Some animals don't see every
living thing as prey...

888
01:41:08,759 --> 01:41:10,451
they choose their
prey selectively!

889
01:41:10,476 --> 01:41:11,252
That's not an answer!

890
01:41:11,259 --> 01:41:14,409
I answered though, Why did
you want to save Anjana?

891
01:41:14,747 --> 01:41:17,533
Anjana reminds me of Ajay!
same age!

892
01:41:18,941 --> 01:41:20,232
What did you do to Anjana?

893
01:41:20,285 --> 01:41:22,107
All I want are organs...

894
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:24,920
Fresh... Organs!

895
01:41:25,441 --> 01:41:27,680
I keep them alive and start
taking piece by piece!

896
01:41:28,202 --> 01:41:30,935
Since they are kids, need
to be handled with care...

897
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,834
but that's when you came!

898
01:41:33,347 --> 01:41:35,440
Rhythm, How is it possible...

899
01:41:36,358 --> 01:41:38,310
being adventurous
despite pregnancy?

900
01:41:38,335 --> 01:41:40,731
I'm just pregnant...

901
01:41:40,756 --> 01:41:42,318
not a brain-damaged!

902
01:41:43,587 --> 01:41:44,727
KIDS!

903
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:46,410
Wait...

904
01:41:46,426 --> 01:41:47,962
When you say kids...

905
01:41:48,066 --> 01:41:49,837
you meant Anjana
and Ajay, right?

906
01:41:53,326 --> 01:41:55,851
No doubt Rhythm, You are smart!

907
01:41:57,858 --> 01:42:00,175
Till now, I kidnapped 17 kids!

908
01:42:01,476 --> 01:42:04,213
And in this town...

909
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:05,238
FOUR!

910
01:42:07,665 --> 01:42:10,503
All the kids... for their organs?

911
01:42:10,686 --> 01:42:11,988
Now my TURN!

912
01:42:13,758 --> 01:42:17,898
What I'm gonna say next, will
it be safe for the baby inside?

913
01:42:19,357 --> 01:42:24,747
Even if she has a bit of courage
like her mother, she will suffice!

914
01:42:27,222 --> 01:42:29,097
What did you do with other kids?

915
01:42:29,165 --> 01:42:32,342
All are kids... and
they are tender...

916
01:42:33,592 --> 01:42:35,779
So once I remove the organs,

917
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:40,467
I will allow them to
suffer without sedative...

918
01:42:40,492 --> 01:42:44,269
and listen to their
cry with bliss...

919
01:42:44,321 --> 01:42:47,799
then drag and...

920
01:42:47,824 --> 01:42:53,007
chop them into pieces...

921
01:42:53,324 --> 01:42:56,177
then solve it in acid and...

922
01:42:56,577 --> 01:42:58,712
the bones...

923
01:42:58,738 --> 01:43:00,769
the flesh...

924
01:43:00,796 --> 01:43:03,712
everything dissolves into a broth!

925
01:43:04,129 --> 01:43:05,743
Then I take it and...

926
01:43:11,082 --> 01:43:12,802
drown it in the Lake!

927
01:43:12,827 --> 01:43:13,827
CONSTABLES!

928
01:43:14,181 --> 01:43:14,988
Get up Rhythm!

929
01:43:15,014 --> 01:43:16,680
There is no point in
talking further.

930
01:43:16,707 --> 01:43:18,686
Sir, he didn't provide
the answers yet...

931
01:43:18,834 --> 01:43:20,500
Please sir, this
game is the only way!

932
01:43:20,525 --> 01:43:22,035
- What you did to Ajay?
- No Rhythm!

933
01:43:22,077 --> 01:43:23,092
Sir... Please sir!

934
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:25,401
- He's far more dangerous!
- We shouldn't stop the game!

935
01:43:25,426 --> 01:43:26,988
Drag him to interrogation cell!

936
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,062
SIR!

937
01:43:29,229 --> 01:43:31,051
Sir, only he can
answer my questions!

938
01:43:31,312 --> 01:43:32,457
We need to continue the game...

939
01:43:32,536 --> 01:43:34,228
We will be able to find
other kids as well...

940
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,665
- Please sir, give me a chance!
- Poor girl!

941
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:38,696
Give her a chance Inspector!

942
01:43:39,322 --> 01:43:42,681
It only gets interesting
from here!

943
01:43:46,664 --> 01:43:49,816
SP(Superintendent of Police) is on
the way, I will give you 10 minutes.

944
01:43:51,223 --> 01:43:53,749
These are the photos of six children
that went missing in this town...

945
01:43:53,775 --> 01:43:54,910
Apart from Anjana and Ajay,

946
01:43:54,935 --> 01:43:56,941
I want to know who are
the other two kids?

947
01:43:56,966 --> 01:43:58,633
You got only 10 minutes!

948
01:44:01,343 --> 01:44:04,207
Good Rhythm, I like your conviction!

949
01:44:04,390 --> 01:44:06,096
We are running out of time,

950
01:44:06,121 --> 01:44:09,638
So let's make this
game more interesting!

951
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:12,540
I give you 10 WISHES...

952
01:44:12,983 --> 01:44:14,935
You can ask only 10 questions!

953
01:44:15,562 --> 01:44:17,879
Same rules... let's continue.

954
01:44:19,692 --> 01:44:21,957
- In these..?
- Observe the game carefully.

955
01:44:23,546 --> 01:44:25,967
Again... It's my turn.

956
01:44:26,791 --> 01:44:28,926
Where you got all this courage?

957
01:44:29,176 --> 01:44:31,858
Once you decide to get into the sea,

958
01:44:31,911 --> 01:44:34,671
You shouldn't fear of
losing sight of the shore!

959
01:44:37,197 --> 01:44:39,176
Who are the four
kids among these?

960
01:44:39,983 --> 01:44:42,769
You can't ask in a bunch...

961
01:44:42,822 --> 01:44:46,103
you need to ask one by one.

962
01:44:46,494 --> 01:44:50,790
So don't waste your wishes
asking for unwanted questions!

963
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:53,488
You may need them later!

964
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:58,384
What consequences are you ready
to face for your courage?

965
01:44:58,958 --> 01:44:59,958
Anything!

966
01:45:02,317 --> 01:45:03,317
Yes!

967
01:45:04,713 --> 01:45:08,712
- Are you sure? Anything?
- Except for my family!

968
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:12,030
Yes!

969
01:45:12,619 --> 01:45:14,208
Can you be specific...

970
01:45:14,233 --> 01:45:16,422
whom in particular
in the family?

971
01:45:16,447 --> 01:45:17,447
My kids!

972
01:45:19,103 --> 01:45:20,103
No!

973
01:45:21,656 --> 01:45:26,525
Who do you like the most? Ajay or the unborn?

974
01:45:26,619 --> 01:45:27,843
Both are my blood!

975
01:45:29,979 --> 01:45:30,979
Yes!

976
01:45:31,134 --> 01:45:32,660
Both are your blood,

977
01:45:32,686 --> 01:45:34,535
but one belongs to Raghu...

978
01:45:34,587 --> 01:45:36,256
and one belongs to Goutham so...

979
01:45:36,281 --> 01:45:39,822
answer me, Whom do
you prefer the most?

980
01:45:41,582 --> 01:45:42,582
Ajay!

981
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:47,650
No!

982
01:45:48,916 --> 01:45:51,728
So, Is it fine to leave
your unborn to die?

983
01:45:51,851 --> 01:45:52,970
Take a look again!

984
01:45:53,135 --> 01:45:55,635
I said NO! Now answer me!

985
01:45:56,234 --> 01:45:58,057
You only kidnapped! You are lying!

986
01:45:58,083 --> 01:46:00,088
Goddammit! SIT DOWN!

987
01:46:04,332 --> 01:46:05,666
The game's not over yet!

988
01:46:07,239 --> 01:46:08,436
Answer my question.

989
01:46:09,974 --> 01:46:12,734
Is it fine to leave
your unborn to die?

990
01:46:12,759 --> 01:46:16,613
Until I'm alive, I won't
let anyone harm them!

991
01:46:16,638 --> 01:46:17,638
Beautiful!

992
01:46:18,073 --> 01:46:20,129
You kidnapped Ajay...

993
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:21,484
what did you do to him?

994
01:46:21,536 --> 01:46:25,155
If I had Ajay, I wouldn't
have spared his organs!

995
01:46:26,562 --> 01:46:29,036
Now answer my
earlier question...

996
01:46:29,453 --> 01:46:31,926
Why did I want
to talk to YOU?

997
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:36,256
If you didn't do...

998
01:46:37,073 --> 01:46:39,052
then who kept the
RIP flower bouquet...

999
01:46:40,614 --> 01:46:42,775
Who was there in the
lake with the umbrella?

1000
01:46:44,207 --> 01:46:45,207
That...

1001
01:46:45,848 --> 01:46:47,555
Why did you do all that?

1002
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:51,812
I haven't missed a detail Rhythm,
so you find it.

1003
01:46:53,286 --> 01:46:55,812
Even though I saw
you in the lake...

1004
01:46:55,845 --> 01:46:58,423
why did I spare
you as a witness?

1005
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:00,760
Think!

1006
01:47:01,661 --> 01:47:02,661
Think!

1007
01:47:02,937 --> 01:47:03,937
THINK!

1008
01:47:04,187 --> 01:47:10,307
You diverted the case towards
kidnapper and escaped your crimes...

1009
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:13,328
Then why all this game?

1010
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:17,275
I told you Rhythm, I
like your courage.

1011
01:47:17,667 --> 01:47:18,838
I care for you!

1012
01:47:18,943 --> 01:47:23,447
Now answer me, Why did I
want to talk to you?

1013
01:47:24,046 --> 01:47:25,046
Because...

1014
01:47:25,505 --> 01:47:28,812
You wanted to find that my
weakness are my kids.

1015
01:47:31,338 --> 01:47:32,510
but, why do you want to know?

1016
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:35,755
You can't paint without a brush.

1017
01:47:36,432 --> 01:47:38,176
You need to search
in the right path!

1018
01:47:38,906 --> 01:47:42,005
When you change your perception,
everything will be clear to you

1019
01:47:43,047 --> 01:47:44,047
I didn't kidnap.

1020
01:47:44,635 --> 01:47:48,384
So, the kidnapper's target is...

1021
01:47:48,724 --> 01:47:52,395
Ajay or You or your weakness?

1022
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:55,156
Think... THINK!

1023
01:47:55,208 --> 01:47:56,208
All of them are...

1024
01:47:56,213 --> 01:47:59,624
interconnected... and all are the same!

1025
01:47:59,649 --> 01:48:02,062
Fantastic! Fantastic Rhythm!

1026
01:48:02,087 --> 01:48:04,874
Now answer my next
question carefully.

1027
01:48:06,473 --> 01:48:08,739
Who... kidnapped... Ajay?

1028
01:48:16,072 --> 01:48:17,165
Do you know him?

1029
01:48:17,661 --> 01:48:19,718
Your ten questions are over...

1030
01:48:19,796 --> 01:48:21,210
now answer my question!

1031
01:48:21,236 --> 01:48:24,275
No... No... No... you know him.
Who is it?

1032
01:48:24,328 --> 01:48:26,236
Who kidnapped Ajay? Who?

1033
01:48:26,271 --> 01:48:28,093
Don't get diverted Rhythm!

1034
01:48:29,176 --> 01:48:32,275
Now answer my question,
Who kidnapped Ajay?

1035
01:48:34,192 --> 01:48:35,192
THINK!

1036
01:48:36,379 --> 01:48:38,045
Come on... Think!

1037
01:48:39,554 --> 01:48:41,378
Who kidnapped Ajay?

1038
01:48:41,535 --> 01:48:42,629
I don't know!

1039
01:48:42,904 --> 01:48:43,904
I don't know!

1040
01:48:45,041 --> 01:48:46,186
I don't know!

1041
01:48:49,285 --> 01:48:50,743
GAME OVER!

1042
01:48:51,941 --> 01:48:52,982
You can leave now.

1043
01:48:53,114 --> 01:48:55,327
No... No... No... Please
tell me the truth!

1044
01:48:55,328 --> 01:48:56,455
- Please... Please...
- Constables...

1045
01:48:56,456 --> 01:49:00,472
Please tell me who kidnapped Ajay,
Please... Please

1046
01:49:00,654 --> 01:49:01,654
Tell me who kidnapped Ajay?

1047
01:49:01,711 --> 01:49:03,744
- Take her away.
- Tell me please...

1048
01:49:03,822 --> 01:49:04,822
Grab him!

1049
01:49:06,998 --> 01:49:07,998
Rhythm!

1050
01:49:08,223 --> 01:49:09,785
You played well!

1051
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,967
You are like a joker
in a pack of cards!

1052
01:49:15,748 --> 01:49:17,935
One can end the game
with or without Joker!

1053
01:49:19,239 --> 01:49:20,239
and you...

1054
01:49:21,363 --> 01:49:23,003
don't deserve to live!

1055
01:49:23,524 --> 01:49:24,524
Really?

1056
01:49:27,483 --> 01:49:29,149
Ajay is not my prey!

1057
01:49:29,748 --> 01:49:32,275
but still he's prey for someone!

1058
01:49:32,353 --> 01:49:33,748
So, don't forget that.

1059
01:49:33,773 --> 01:49:34,946
GOOD LUCK!

1060
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:43,041
Ajay...

1061
01:49:51,249 --> 01:49:53,671
Goutham Please, pick up Goutham...

1062
01:49:55,598 --> 01:49:56,598
Pick up!

1063
01:50:00,155 --> 01:50:02,186
Ajay haven't responded
to anyone yet...

1064
01:50:02,586 --> 01:50:04,955
but still he threw the rod
away when you commanded him.

1065
01:50:05,493 --> 01:50:06,493
Why?

1066
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:13,426
It's been seven years now, We are
not blessed with a child yet!

1067
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,983
He went on a business trip, not
even reachable over the phone!

1068
01:50:55,034 --> 01:50:56,257
- Goutham!
- Rhythm...

1069
01:50:56,988 --> 01:50:58,211
I'm sorry Rhythm...

1070
01:50:58,486 --> 01:50:59,486
Ajay...

1071
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:01,481
Somebody please help us...

1072
01:51:01,506 --> 01:51:02,639
Ajay was taken...

1073
01:51:02,837 --> 01:51:03,982
by a...

1074
01:51:04,086 --> 01:51:05,950
I saw a girl's hand...

1075
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,160
It's a GIRL!

1076
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:10,013
she went that way.

1077
01:51:10,467 --> 01:51:12,550
Goutham, did you see her?

1078
01:51:12,758 --> 01:51:16,915
Who is she?

1079
01:51:17,082 --> 01:51:18,148
Who is the Girl?

1080
01:51:18,462 --> 01:51:20,050
It's... a...

1081
01:51:20,482 --> 01:51:21,482
girl...

1082
01:51:22,097 --> 01:51:23,998
It's a girl!

1083
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:31,588
Girl?

1084
01:51:31,668 --> 01:51:32,668
Who is the girl?

1085
01:51:35,586 --> 01:51:36,586
Who is it?

1086
01:51:37,346 --> 01:51:38,346
WHO???

1087
01:51:39,405 --> 01:51:41,930
Do you know why I
want to talk to you?

1088
01:51:43,014 --> 01:51:44,014
Why..Why me?

1089
01:51:44,134 --> 01:51:47,649
All your questions
will be answered

1090
01:51:48,248 --> 01:51:50,019
Think... THINK...

1091
01:51:50,191 --> 01:51:50,790
Think...

1092
01:51:50,842 --> 01:51:52,743
I have answered already!

1093
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:55,060
- Think... Think...
- What was the answer?

1094
01:51:55,138 --> 01:51:57,039
You can't paint without a brush!

1095
01:51:57,603 --> 01:51:58,603
Paint...

1096
01:51:59,191 --> 01:52:00,191
Paint...

1097
01:52:01,092 --> 01:52:02,081
Paint...

1098
01:52:03,070 --> 01:52:04,070
What's in it?

1099
01:52:06,438 --> 01:52:12,063
Charlie Chaplin uncle with an
umbrella was standing there Aunty!

1100
01:52:12,134 --> 01:52:12,759
I don't get it...

1101
01:52:12,872 --> 01:52:16,803
If the perception changes,
everything will be clear!

1102
01:52:21,342 --> 01:52:22,878
So... kidnapper should
be left-handed!

1103
01:52:22,903 --> 01:52:25,064
Who... Kidnapped... Ajay?

1104
01:52:30,262 --> 01:52:31,668
So, Ajay was kidnapped by...

1105
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,040
Why?

1106
01:54:06,095 --> 01:54:07,517
Are you surprised?

1107
01:54:08,887 --> 01:54:10,792
Is it because the
kidnapper was a woman?

1108
01:54:13,001 --> 01:54:14,537
or because it's me?

1109
01:54:18,156 --> 01:54:20,630
You assumed that the
person with an umbrella...

1110
01:54:23,798 --> 01:54:25,314
should be a man!

1111
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:26,840
Where's Ajay?

1112
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:30,933
Did you find the left-hander
clue from gloves...

1113
01:54:30,959 --> 01:54:32,626
Or from your kid's sketches?

1114
01:54:33,902 --> 01:54:34,902
Is Ajay here?

1115
01:54:35,699 --> 01:54:36,699
Ajay...

1116
01:54:37,418 --> 01:54:38,418
Ajay...

1117
01:54:40,074 --> 01:54:41,074
Where is Ajay?

1118
01:54:41,845 --> 01:54:43,245
Why are you asking me?

1119
01:54:44,136 --> 01:54:45,724
Then what's the point
in the kidnapping?

1120
01:54:47,887 --> 01:54:50,334
You didn't harm Ajay, right?

1121
01:54:52,225 --> 01:54:53,943
I will do whatever you want...

1122
01:54:54,751 --> 01:54:57,277
But Please spare Ajay

1123
01:55:07,772 --> 01:55:10,897
If I ask you to drink this
to answer your question?

1124
01:55:19,195 --> 01:55:20,195
Tell me now...

1125
01:55:24,325 --> 01:55:26,565
So you will do anything...

1126
01:55:27,919 --> 01:55:29,560
because he's your world.

1127
01:55:32,008 --> 01:55:35,367
But, my world was
shattered to pieces...

1128
01:55:36,982 --> 01:55:39,898
I tried a lot to
fix it up, but...

1129
01:55:40,732 --> 01:55:43,700
I see only you in every
shattered pieces.

1130
01:55:46,373 --> 01:55:49,992
Teacher, Rhythm will do this better,
why did you put it on Bhavana?

1131
01:55:50,513 --> 01:55:52,466
Take this and put it on Rhythm!

1132
01:55:52,482 --> 01:55:54,356
So for the fanny...

1133
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:58,756
All the school girls also many!

1134
01:55:58,862 --> 01:56:00,632
The grass is the green...

1135
01:56:00,659 --> 01:56:03,263
Since childhood, you
are always in light...

1136
01:56:03,782 --> 01:56:05,344
and I'm in darkness!

1137
01:56:06,023 --> 01:56:08,914
You know whats the cruelest
punishment in this world?

1138
01:56:09,461 --> 01:56:13,445
To lose one's self
and imitate others!

1139
01:56:13,706 --> 01:56:15,710
Dad, I'm first again...

1140
01:56:16,246 --> 01:56:17,627
in athletes.

1141
01:56:17,784 --> 01:56:20,388
What about your exams? Rhythm is school first!

1142
01:56:20,935 --> 01:56:23,086
What's the point in adding
such useless trophies?

1143
01:56:23,138 --> 01:56:24,138
Go and study like her!

1144
01:56:24,685 --> 01:56:28,096
[Bhavana Mom] Yeah, you are always with her,
why don't you learn something from her?

1145
01:56:28,591 --> 01:56:31,325
Even though they push me
to follow your steps,

1146
01:56:31,585 --> 01:56:33,617
but falling in love
was my choice!

1147
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:37,159
But even that guy
chose you over me!

1148
01:56:38,825 --> 01:56:42,435
Everybody asked me to imitate you
and eventually I lost my identity.

1149
01:56:42,460 --> 01:56:44,414
We got an alliance for Rhythm.

1150
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:47,643
[Bhavana Mom] Even our daughter
is ready for marriage.

1151
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:50,820
Rhythm is an orphan, we
should take care of her.

1152
01:56:50,847 --> 01:56:53,545
If you keep pushing me back...

1153
01:56:53,597 --> 01:56:56,018
then how will I move forward?

1154
01:56:56,992 --> 01:57:01,575
Comparing with others
is also violence!

1155
01:57:01,835 --> 01:57:05,574
Throughout my life, wherever
I go, I keep hearing...

1156
01:57:05,626 --> 01:57:14,157
RHYTHM! Rhythm! RHYTHM!

1157
01:57:14,247 --> 01:57:16,174
You destroyed my identity!

1158
01:57:17,684 --> 01:57:20,105
So, I created one for myself!

1159
01:57:24,221 --> 01:57:26,221
I want to pull this trigger...

1160
01:57:26,425 --> 01:57:29,028
But I want you to see
what's happening around...

1161
01:57:30,305 --> 01:57:32,778
Then only you can
understand my pain.

1162
01:57:38,247 --> 01:57:42,544
You were crashed when your kid
was missing for five minutes!

1163
01:57:43,081 --> 01:57:44,695
That's when I decided...

1164
01:57:44,904 --> 01:57:45,904
To kidnap him!

1165
01:57:46,336 --> 01:57:47,585
I swear...

1166
01:57:48,237 --> 01:57:51,153
that I wanted to leave
him the next day.

1167
01:57:51,925 --> 01:57:55,596
But, I liked the way you
grieved the whole day!

1168
01:57:56,664 --> 01:57:58,799
So, I extended one more day!

1169
01:57:59,164 --> 01:58:00,518
You were in more pain!

1170
01:58:00,882 --> 01:58:02,731
Then I extended a week,

1171
01:58:02,784 --> 01:58:04,320
you were devastated!

1172
01:58:05,153 --> 01:58:09,153
I started enjoying
each moment and now...

1173
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:11,185
it's been six years!

1174
01:58:12,784 --> 01:58:15,023
My 20 years of anger!

1175
01:58:17,617 --> 01:58:19,622
Everything was fine until...

1176
01:58:19,674 --> 01:58:22,903
the doctor copied my
style of kidnapping!

1177
01:58:23,112 --> 01:58:24,596
I got agitated...

1178
01:58:25,064 --> 01:58:28,058
Somehow Kathir
followed me into the forest!

1179
01:58:31,211 --> 01:58:32,482
- Bhavana...
- Kathir!

1180
01:58:32,507 --> 01:58:33,107
Ajay...

1181
01:58:35,169 --> 01:58:36,169
Stab him!

1182
01:58:36,669 --> 01:58:40,289
- Ajay... Ajay...
- Run away Ajay...

1183
01:58:45,263 --> 01:58:48,231
More than escaping from me...

1184
01:58:48,256 --> 01:58:51,380
I was pissed off that
he came back to you.

1185
01:58:52,607 --> 01:58:54,638
He shouldn't be with you.

1186
01:58:55,758 --> 01:58:57,971
That's why I took
him back again!

1187
01:58:58,429 --> 01:59:02,152
If you want to hurt, hurt me...

1188
01:59:02,935 --> 01:59:04,158
but not my kid.

1189
01:59:05,034 --> 01:59:06,622
He's a child!

1190
01:59:07,325 --> 01:59:09,486
For which child are
you empathizing now?

1191
01:59:19,956 --> 01:59:21,022
What did you do?

1192
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:22,471
What did you do?

1193
01:59:23,775 --> 01:59:25,311
What the hell you did?

1194
01:59:25,336 --> 01:59:27,915
Hey, Just chill!

1195
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:30,091
Why did you commit this
sin to the unborn?

1196
01:59:30,492 --> 01:59:33,226
Your unborn will be alive
for one more hour!

1197
01:59:36,315 --> 01:59:37,460
Where is Ajay?

1198
01:59:39,102 --> 01:59:40,611
I gave the same drink to him!

1199
01:59:44,102 --> 01:59:45,435
He should be dead now...

1200
01:59:46,106 --> 01:59:47,304
or else...

1201
01:59:48,318 --> 01:59:50,403
he too got one hour!

1202
01:59:50,846 --> 01:59:53,216
I'm not going to kill your kids,

1203
01:59:53,528 --> 01:59:55,507
It depends on your choice.

1204
01:59:55,532 --> 01:59:59,716
I'm going to give you the same comparison
equation that destroyed my life!

1205
01:59:59,741 --> 02:00:04,558
Decide one among them
by comparing and save!

1206
02:00:08,725 --> 02:00:09,846
What will I do now..?

1207
02:00:09,951 --> 02:00:13,075
You are going to save one
and let other one die.

1208
02:00:13,883 --> 02:00:16,216
and when you think
about your choice...

1209
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:20,539
BHAVANA... Bhavana... BHAVANA...

1210
02:00:20,618 --> 02:00:22,636
That's all you will remember...

1211
02:00:22,663 --> 02:00:23,756
FOREVER!

1212
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:33,626
AJAY!

1213
02:00:35,450 --> 02:00:36,450
Ajju...

1214
02:00:38,758 --> 02:00:41,845
Somehow Kathir
followed me into the forest!

1215
02:00:43,781 --> 02:00:44,781
Cyrus!

1216
02:02:16,414 --> 02:02:17,414
AJAY!

1217
02:02:22,453 --> 02:02:23,453
AJAY!

1218
02:02:28,842 --> 02:02:29,842
AJAY!

1219
02:02:45,548 --> 02:02:46,548
Ajay...

1220
02:02:53,414 --> 02:02:54,414
Cyrus...

1221
02:02:57,414 --> 02:02:59,471
I took a wrong decision.

1222
02:03:01,109 --> 02:03:02,987
I should have tried to...

1223
02:03:05,174 --> 02:03:06,762
save atleast one child.

1224
02:03:20,857 --> 02:03:21,857

02:05:31,577 --> 02:05:32,577
- Ma...
- Ajju...

1246
02:05:55,525 --> 02:05:56,525
Ajju...

1247
02:05:58,118 --> 02:05:59,446
I'm not... well

1248
02:06:10,461 --> 02:06:13,121
Ma, What happened ma?

1249
02:06:15,216 --> 02:06:16,414
Ma...

1250
02:06:22,237 --> 02:06:24,268
Ma, come let's go...

1251
02:06:24,867 --> 02:06:26,846
Let's go ma...

1252
02:06:28,867 --> 02:06:30,429
Let's go ma...

1253
02:06:34,647 --> 02:06:35,647
Ajay...

1254
02:06:38,476 --> 02:06:39,476
Ajay...

1255
02:07:07,336 --> 02:07:11,633
When the mother Penguin escapes
the sharks, crocodiles...

1256
02:07:11,659 --> 02:07:15,044
and saved the little nestling,

1257
02:07:15,071 --> 02:07:20,216
Then only she realized that another
Penguin has kidnapped the nestling.

1258
02:07:20,372 --> 02:07:21,372
After that...

1259
02:07:21,397 --> 02:07:23,531
the Penguin and the
little nestling

1260
02:07:23,556 --> 02:07:26,320
lived happily ever after.

1261
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:27,847
Super!

1262
02:07:34,944 --> 02:07:36,428
If not for Kathir...

1263
02:07:36,872 --> 02:07:38,434
We wouldn't have got Ajay!

1264
02:07:39,335 --> 02:07:42,069
I don't know how Abi will
lead her life all alone!

1265
02:07:43,867 --> 02:07:45,168
Abi is pregnant...

1266
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:48,110
and she got us.

1267
02:07:49,247 --> 02:07:52,658
As a mother, she decided
to move on for her kid!

1268
02:07:52,996 --> 02:07:55,652
Mother is always a special
relationship, right?

1269
02:07:56,579 --> 02:08:00,068
Being a mother is not
just a relationship...

1270
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:03,245
THAT'S AN ATTITUDE!

1271
02:08:03,766 --> 02:08:05,979
Hey Rhythm, How's my baby now?

1272
02:08:06,162 --> 02:08:07,386
The baby is active

1273
02:08:07,594 --> 02:08:09,720
Due to the minimal
intake of the drink,

1274
02:08:09,745 --> 02:08:11,307
we were able to save the Child.

1275
02:08:11,364 --> 02:08:13,521
Keep your adventurous
journey aside,

1276
02:08:13,541 --> 02:08:15,141
and enjoy the pregnancy!

1277
02:08:16,031 --> 02:08:17,334
Can we see the baby?

1278
02:08:17,531 --> 02:08:18,531
Okay Doctor!

1279
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:21,124
I want to see the baby...

1280
02:08:21,437 --> 02:08:23,598
You can see in this
monitor screen.

1281
02:08:27,972 --> 02:08:29,977
Mom is so lucky, right?

1282
02:08:30,002 --> 02:08:31,371
The baby is the lucky one,

1283
02:08:31,427 --> 02:08:35,307
because trusting the Mother, baby
enters this world without fear!
