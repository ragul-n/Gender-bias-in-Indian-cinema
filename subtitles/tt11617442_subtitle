3
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,280
How did you get this much money ?

4
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,460
Friend gave me to start business.

5
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,440
With whom you are going to do business ?

6
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,460
Hello, Buddy,  
I am coming.

7
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,700
You are going without answering my question.

8
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,320
I will come back and explain you in detail.

9
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,800

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,000
Hi, are you waiting for a long ?

13
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,660
It’s ok.

14
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,840
Shall we go ? 
-Yes

15
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,730
What happened ?

16
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,760
Why are you sad ?

17
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,300
I feel bad as I absconded from marriage.

18
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,280
Why don’t you marry and come ?

19
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,860
No hubby

20
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,410
It’s a big shame for my father, right?

21
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,530
That's why

22
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,360
Ok ok, come.. 
let’s go home and talk further.

23
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,010
Wow, thanks.

24
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,460
Annam , It’s not a big palace..

25
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,690
it’s just a small home.

26
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,490
You will be alone after I go for job.

27
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,570
Look at these later.

28
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,760
Annam.

29
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,960
Is this the room ? 
-Yes

30
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,920
This is our room where we sleep .

31
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,060
I believed you and came with you.

32
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,260
You cheat me like this?

33
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,940

34
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,880
Oh my God  
-Don’t cry .

35
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,130
To whom I can say these.

36
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,220
I deserve this as I absconded 
 from my marriage.

37
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,490
Hey...Why do you create a scene now ?

38
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,930

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,570

43
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,440
Hmm.

44
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,290
I won’t come to your room  
without your permission

45
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,840
Is that ok ? Happy ? 
-Huh

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,930
Have to change my dress..Please go out.

47
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,800
Hmm... 
Hope I’m in my room.

48
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,240
Get out of your room .

49
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,980
People concern Bhagavadgita, bible and 
 Quran are noble books.

50
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,100
As per my concern this is my noble book.

51
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,610
Baby,you know why ?

52
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,010
This is going to change our life.

53
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,360
Ya Ya, we have stuffs to do in our life.

54
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,730
I was worried before.

55
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,160
Hannah,You know one thing, 
The life is going to be changed.

56
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,240
We have abandoned money in our hand.

57
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,960
I’m glad now.

58
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,900
We are going to marry , 
we are going to have kids.

59
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,000
Ok 
You know

60
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,960
The hard phase is going to over. 
-Hmm

61
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,600
Aah shit 
-Who are you ?

62
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,040
What do you want?

63
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,360
Honey, why are they holding a gun?

64
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,810
What’s happening ?

65
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,080
Silence.

66
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,900
What do you want ? what’s going on ? 
-Silence

67
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,600
Silence 
-What’s happening ?

68
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
What's going on? 
-Silence

69
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,520
Sometimes we have to take violence 
 to make silence.

70
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,170
A person having 10 rupees  
give one rupee for beggar.

71
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,120
A person having 100 rupees  
give 10 rupees for beggar.

72
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,480
A person having 1000 rupees  
spend in hundreds just like that.

73
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,850
A person having one lakh rupees  
spends for parties in thousands.

74
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:24,100
But a person having crores of money 
 doesn’t give even a penny for anyone.

75
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,800
Like that, we stolen those money from them ..

76
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,450
But you stolen it from me.

77
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,570
See it..

78
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,330
Where you hide?

79
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,530
Where is the money ?

80
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,960
Tell me.

81
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,680
Will tell you boss.. 
Will tell you where the money is.

82
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,520
Where is it?

83
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,800
Tell me

84
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,490
Catch him man, catch him.

85
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,090
Boss, get up.

86
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,520
Catch him.

87
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,170
Hey, stop man...

88
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,520
Hey I am following him

89
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,120
Follow me 
Come this side soon.

90
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,060
Will kill you if you didn’t catch him.

91
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,060
Hey, come on.

92
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,120
Where have you all been lost ?

93
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,570
Made me to search of them..

94
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,770
Riya..Riya.

95
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,450
Hey, you seem to be talking in phone always.

96
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,690
Need half day off ?

97
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,280
Just you came here..

98
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,760
Not even one customer arrived since.

99
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,180
But you are asking for day off ?

100
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,260
When did customer came here ?

101
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,010

102
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,500
Ok go.

103
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,640
Thanks. buddy bye.

104
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,010
Oh sh*t.

105
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,570
Who is it ? OMG!

106
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,610
No one seen

107
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,180
Hello brother ?

108
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,540
Oh my God...

109
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,060
Nothing to worry brother.. 
Let’s go to hospital.

110
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,680
Nothing to worry. Brother

111
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,580
Sit down.

112
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:02,820
Each and every thing is seen by satellite  
and CCTV cameras rather than God..

113
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,420
You can’t escape from that.

114
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,170
A car comes now.. 
Follow it and come

115
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,480
Go.

116
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,810
Go man Go go

117
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,340
Move forward.

118
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,560
Where is he ?

119
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,050
Gone. sir

120
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,850
Where he gone?

121
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,100
I admitted him in hospital that day.

122
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,810
Next day when I went to see him,  
he was not there.

123
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,540
Don’t know where he went .

124
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,240
We can’t eat while talking, 
likewise

125
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,720
We shouldn’t eat while talking.

126
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,570
Which hospital ?

127
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,440
A hospital in sideways of National Highway..

128
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,800
Don’t remember the name.

129
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,080
Have a drink.

130
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,120
Not used to.

131
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,850
It isn’t fair not to offer drink for guest.

132
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,320
No sir. 
-Why?

133
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,210
Don’t you have a habit of drinking ?

134
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,920
No 
Have drunk with my friends.

135
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,960
We are friends too..So have a drink.

136
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,370
Sir, why are you in search of him ?

137
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,650
Hunger.

138
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,170
If a guy takes away all the food prepared for five persons 
 before everyone have it ?

139
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,290
One man only take and runaway all the food

140
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,680
How will it feel,?

141
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,410
Huh,will feel more hungry sir.

142
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,900
Ha ha ha... 
Hunger.

143
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,380
Hunger....hunger...

144
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:49,200
Go Hey  
-Come here.

145
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,370
Throw it away.

146
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,060

Shit... 
Are you drunk ?

149
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,520
Because of work pressure had some.

150
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,160
Every alcoholic says a reason.. 
But your reason seems to be very old.

151
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,880
Sorry Annam.

152
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,610

158
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,440

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,920
Sit down , He is taking bath.. 
Will ask him to come.

161
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,420

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,000
Baby, did my mind voice reached him ?

163
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,410

Where is he ?

168
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,480
He gone out sir.

169
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,890
Where did he go ?

170
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,460
Huh friends.

171
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,480

172
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,160
We have to take headache tablet 
 if it’s a headache.

173
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,850

00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,820
Come on boys.

186
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,300
You made to drink coffee in car 
 instead of having it in your home.

187
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,810
But coffee was good.

188
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,410
Hey, stop the car.

189
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,080
Hey stop the car

190
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,900
It’s good if you say the truth.

191
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,800
Where is he ?

192
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,450
I don’t know sir.

193
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,450
Where did he go ?

194
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,100
Won't you say anything?

195
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,850
Sir, really I don’t know. 
-Where he gone?

196
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,650
Where is he?

197
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,460
He went sir.

198
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,050
Will shoot you, 
 if you don’t say.

199
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,600
Will shoot you for sure.

200
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,560
Our boys get scared 
 if I scare him.

201
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,770
Looks like you Tamil guys..

202
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,770
I’m fan of Thala and Thalapathy..

203
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,740
It’s been two days since I had food.

204
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,900
Please give me some money.

205
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,460
Thank you.

206
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:22,730
Head ?

207
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,600
Head, wow it’s a head.

208
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,290
Yes 
-Now you are dead.

209
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,820
What do you look at ?

210
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,530

00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,140
No he don't get hungry

212

Tell me..

231
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,060

Tell it man.... tell...

233
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,810
Sir, he has bullet wound in his body.

234
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,600
I didn’t do anything

235
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,610
I don’t know whether he died because of my gun shot 
 or because of your car.

236
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,740
Don’t worry boss, 
 I will find it.

237
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,040
Let’s go.

238
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,780
Go....everything gone

239
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,140
Boss, keeping him with us is good  
until we find our money.

240
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,360
Hmm....

241
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,220
Need courage to do a murder..

242
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,640
But need to be clever to hide a dead body.

243
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,010
I don’t know whatever you were doing till now  
and to whom you were working ,

244
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,440
But from tomorrow

00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,380
Thanks god, he didn’t see it.

260
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,340
Hope he saw it.

261
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,570
He may torture me

262
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,540
Don’t know whatever he is gonna question me.

263
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,000
What did you see ?

264
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,800
He is looking again and again which I saw.

265
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,980
I saw what you saw?

266
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,880
What did you see ?

267
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,260
Will you leave me? 
 if I say nothing

268
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,400
Nothing.

269
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,020
I know there’s nothing..

270
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,940
But tell me what did you see ?

271
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,660

00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,130

275
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:29,900
Huh ?

276
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,650
Call him.

277
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,140
For it? 
Can’t you say it ? Ok. boss

278
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,600
What to do with these guys ?

279
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,940
One can’t hear when he can speak and 
 one can’t speak when he can hear.

280
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,340
What do I do now ?

281
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,760
Boss, don’t worry..I will handle it.

282
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,140
Come early today.

283
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,010
Why ?

284
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,840
Shall I do bajji or bonda for snack ?

285
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,100
Boss is calling you.

286
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,000
Coming.

287
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,690
Tell me , which snack to do ?

288
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,660
Who is on call ?

289
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,610
Wife.

290
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,720
What did you talk about ?

291
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,810
Asked what to do for evening snacks ?

292
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,780
What did you say ?

293
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,520
I instruct her to do both.

294
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,250
Bonda or bajji ?

295
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,160
Both will be good to eat along with coconut chutney  
 isn’t it ?

296
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,200
Shall I come and prepare coconut chutney for you ?

297
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,820
What did he say to him ? 
 why is he angry too much ?

298
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,460
It’s better to die instead of working with these guys.

299
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,410
Open the door.

300
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,520
I’m scared to sleep in my room.

301
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,880
Can I sleep in your room ?

302
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,490
Hmm.

303
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,850
Hey.

304
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,170
Sir.

305
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,580
What will you do if I die ?

306
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,500
Will go home sir.

307
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,960
What will you do if I die?

308
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,520
Don’t worry boss, you won’t die.

309
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,500
What will you do if I’m die ?

310
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,000
I’m still not dead.. 
stop you crying

311
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,900
If I dead? 
I am still alive

312
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,320
What will you do if I’m die ?

313
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,200
Huh ?

314
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,380
How to make him understand ?

315
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,560
What will you do if I’m die ?

316
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,210
Don’t worry boss,  
we will find the money.

317
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,560
Why do I need money after my death.

318
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,930
Money money money.

319
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:41,360
Can’t live in this world without money.

320
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,170
Hey, did you guys sleep ?

321
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,360
Everyone go and sleep..Go.

322
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,740
Go and sleep.

323
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,620
Let me read this book  
until I sleep sir.

324
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:47,720
Sir, I found it..I found  
where the money is.

325
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,410
All got your deserved money 
 for the hard work you did this much days..

326
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,300
For this hard work you get good return

327
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,100
Not necessary for you all to sleep 
 at day time further.

328
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,480
No more work for you here. 
-Ok sir

329
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,050
Terminated you from the job from now on.

330
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:44,400
Happy ?

331
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,440
Happy sir.

332
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,570
But that coffee was very nice.

333
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,820
Tell your girl.

334
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,280
Yes I tell her sir.

335
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,760
Hey, why joined both rooms together.

336
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,720
Just did.

337
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:24,010
Are we ready for it ?

338
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,900
That’s after marriage only.

339
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,970
huh, then why these arrangements.

340
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,210
It’s because I miss you so much.

341
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:38,900
I don’t like to be alone without you.

342
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,000
Even when you are here, 
 we are being separated only.

343
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,820
That’s why.

344
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,930
Oh ok.

345
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:51,890
Look..

346
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,290
Shall we get married ?

347
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,760
Hmm.

348
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,820
Riya..

349
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,010
What you want ?  
why are you stalking me ?

350
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,130
I want to tell you something.

351
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:20,300
I love you.

352
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,490
Can’t you understand what I said already.. 
try to understand.

353
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,360
Huh ?

354
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,410
I hate you.. 
Don’t stalk me further..ok ?

355
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,600
Riya ?

356
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,100
I hate my life.

357
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,560
When the girl we love is not with us.

358
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,180
Whatever money we have is waste

359
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,680
She hates me.

360
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:49,740
Leave me..You go.

361
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,720
Hey, will she return back  
if he keeps on crying ?

362
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,410
We have to move on.

363
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,300
Tell him.

364
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,930
How did she die ? who killed her ? 
 why killed her ?

365
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:06,640
It’s wrong that we disposed her body 
 without knowing anything.

366
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,370
Yes, it’s wrong..We know it..

367
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,340
But what to do now ?

368
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,640
We should have gone to police.

369
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,250
We may go to police,

370
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,920
If we go to police

371
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,220
They inquired who is she? and relatives

372
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,220
At last we don't know they find the killer or not

373
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:31,460
Before that we are all caught by police

374
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,800
Where is her share of money ?

375
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,890
Before her death  
I gave the money to her where it is?

376
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,300
I searched for it..But couldn’t find it.

377
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,740
That means,

378
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,610
Murderer has killed her for money.

379
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,720
From now on ,our job is 
 to find that murderer.

380
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,610
Come on boys.

381
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:39,020

420
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,800

Hello, coming.

424
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,400
You are going without answering my question.

425

I will come back and explain you in detail.

426
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,520

429
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,640
Hey, let’s go in my car itself.

430
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,200
Ok.

431
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,120
To bar , right ?

432
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,400
Go to asian beer cafe

433
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,440
Ordered pizza..Till  
what you need ?

434
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,720
Bar has closed, shall we go? 
 I'll come you go.

435
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,320
I didn’t park the car this way ..I feel confused..

436
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,720
Forgot my keys too.

437
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,120
Door is open.

438
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,360
What’s she doing ?

439
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:31,880
Annam..

440
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,280
What’s she doing.

441
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,760
Annam..

442
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:58,000
Annam.. Annam.. Annam..

443
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,520
Annam what are you doing ?

444
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,280
Annam...

445
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,880
We didn’t hold the work.. 
We are still searching for a year.

446
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,960
But this case is too challenging.

447
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,360
This murder has been done at 11:11 PM without any clue.

448
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,600
The girl has been seen dead in bathtub..

449
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:06,960
But as per post- martem reports the water in her stomach was sea water.

450
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,200
So, murder has not done in home.

451
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,320
What do you say sir ?

452
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,840
Murder is not done in home ?

453
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:19,920
Don’t know.

454
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,440
We can know about murderer only  
if that girl comes alive and tell us.

455
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,120
So please understand..We will find the murderer..

456
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,400
We will get them soon.

457
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,960
Ok sir, thank you.

458
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,120
Annam, why did you leave me.

459
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:16,520
I’m all alone in the home where we lived together.

460
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:21,080
Still I couldn’t find the murderer who killed you.

461
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:28,520
When I ask police, they say that,  
they can find only if you come and tell them.

462
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:34,320
Why should you tell them ? 
 You tell me.

463
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:44,880
I will search for him and kill him and place him  
in front of your graveyard.

464
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,080
Hello Joseph.

465
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,400

Do you think , why I stopped ?

547
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,680
Most of them will give  
money after doing it..

548
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:31,320
But you gave me money for not to do it.

549
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:35,680
But I wish to do it.

550
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,880
Yes, shall we do it ?

551
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,480

Did you shoot me ?

602
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:49,240
You have to target  
while shooting..Sit down.

603
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,000
Sit down.

604
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:59,570
Sorry, understand me..

605
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:03,680
I kidnapped you as  
I wish to talk to you frankly.

606
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:08,560
Look at this beautiful beach.. 
No one is here.

607
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,530
We are only two here.

608
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,640
If so it’s the beach in our country,

609
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,920
There will be disturbance by boys  
who sells snacks.

610
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,360
Look at here..

611
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:27,560
Instead of enjoying the nature 
 you keep on crying.

612
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:32,440
I was to talk about your and 
 my likes and dislikes.

613
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,600
But you are not talking at all.

614
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,560
Please talk some.

615
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,320
Don’t run..stop.

616
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:06,320
Stop..Why do you run  
even for touching you ?

617
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:03,560
Annam..Annam.

618
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:15,440
Who are you ? 
 What do you need ? tell me.

619
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:20,720
I’m telling as you ask me.

620
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:28,840
First,have food..You didn’t have food 
 for a long time..Have it.

621
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,680
Tell me who are you ?

622
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:39,680
It seems like you will eat only 
 if I say about me.

623
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:43,480
Will tell you everything.

624
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,280
Who are you ?

625
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,040
Who are you?

626
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,880
Don’t you know me ?

627
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:57,440
I saw you and engaged you properly..

628
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,960
But you absconded at the time of marriage.

629
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,520
Now, you ask about me ?

630
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,920
What to do ?

631
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,920
That’s why I came in search of you.

632
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:21,940
They are arranging a marriage with a girl 
 like a parrot to a boy like a monkey.

633
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:23,940
I thought about it

634
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,440
Yes, I’m a monkey.

635
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:30,800
But even a monkey has a good heart, right ?

636
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,160
You too said that you like me.

637
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:37,360
So i too liked you.

638
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:41,920
Did you like me or not ?

639
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:43,440
Tell me.

640
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,160
Did you like me or not ?

641
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:48,320
Hmm hmm.

642
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,880
Like me ?

643
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:56,320
Please tell me, I love you.

644
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,760
Tell me.. tell me.. tell me

645
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:02,680
I Love You.

646
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,040
Do you know one thing,

647
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:14,480
I love you is a decent version of saying  
that I’m ready to sleep with you.

648
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:20,760
Now a days many say it like that only.. 
Calling to sleep with them.

649
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:24,000
He has asked you sleep with him  
and you have accepted to sleep with him .

650
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,480
Why ? why did you ?

651
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:31,720
You have to tell  
I love you ,only to me..Ok ?

652
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:35,800
Will you say it to any other ?  
will you ? You shouldn’t .

653
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,680
Don’t cry..don’t cry.

654
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,440
Don’t cry..don’t cry.

655
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:59,280
Smile.

656
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,760
Why did you leave me ?

657
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,040
Because of I’m bald ?

658
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,520
No.

659
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:22,960
Many are bald here.. 
yes, many are bald.

660
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:31,320
Do you know that, in this world there is 
 ratio of 1: 5 women for men..

661
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:38,520
But I didn’t get even one girl.

662
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:43,280
You were there..But you too left me.

663
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:50,440
Why you left me ? why ?

664
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,520
Because I love Joseph.

665
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,600
Because I love Joseph.

666
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:15,960
You know one thing,  
all girls wish to marry heroes.

667
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:21,560
But all heroes are married.

668
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:29,400
Yes ,Vijay,Ajith, Surya, Karthi, 
Sivakarthigeyan,

669
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:34,560
Dhanush , G.V.Prakash  
all are married.

670
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,360
Vishal is committed.

671
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:41,520
Arya is searching for bride.

672
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:54,640
Only simbu is in confusion.. 
Whether Simbu will get married or not ?

673
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:59,920
Tell me whether Simbu will get  
married or not ?

674
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,320
Don’t know.

675
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:02,320
Don’t know ?

676
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,520
Even I don’t know.

677
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,120
Ok, leave it.

678
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:12,440
When is our marriage ?

679
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:18,880
Marriage broker said to me  
that you sing well.

680
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:23,400
Sing one song.

681
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,520
Sing.

682
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,120
You sang well.

683
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,640
Marriage broker told me  
that you dance well too.

684
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,360
so dance now.

685
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:31,120
Ok ..you are tired by dancing..sit down.

686
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,720
You danced well.

687
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:49,120
Saw you singing and dancing..

688
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:54,000
I wish to go for an interval.

689
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,280
I will go and come.

690
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,480
Will you run ?

691
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,440
You won’t run.

692
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,920
Annam..Annam.

693
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:47,000
Open the door.. 
Open the door.

694
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,680
You wish to be with your lover..

695
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:01,520
Likewise I wish to be with my lover.

696
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,360
Is that wrong ?

697
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,560
Ok, don’t cry.

698
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,520
You love him itself.

699
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,560
Let him be your first lover..

700
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:20,200
I won’t mistake you.. 
I will be your second lover.

701
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:27,000
Go and be with him.

702
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:35,240
I sacrifice you.. 
Have a good life.

703
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:40,000
Don’t get scared..It’s me.. 
Your second lover.

704
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:51,080
Do you think that  
I will sacrifice like some heroes in old films ?

705
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,440
Do you want me sacrifice ?

706
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:02,000
I’m not a hero.. 
I’m villain..A big villain.

707
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:10,200
Annam, move aside..It may hurt you.. 
Move aside.

708
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,800
Peek a boo..I see you.

709
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,880
I’m in.

710
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:53,320
Leave it.

711
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:05,200
Shall we get married ?

712
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,600
No.

713
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:09,800
yes.

714
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:21,200
Instead of living together ,  
lets die together.

715
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:09,520
Dreams come for all..But don’t know for  
how many it happens in real.

716
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:14,880
I’m looking at a man now  
whom I saw in my dreams.

717
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:18,000
I haven’t seen him before..

718
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:22,280
But now I can feel the presence of him

719
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:29,120
whenever me and Annam 
 where together.

720
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:39,480
I don’t know any details about him.

721
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:44,520
But it’s him whom I have to kill..It’s him.

722
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:45,800
Only him

723
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:14,680
Do you know one thing,

724
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:27,360
It’s easy to do a murder in this world, 
 but suiciding is so hard.

725
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:30,520
I can't, can't..

726
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:35,920
Each day I attempted for a suicide..

727
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:42,120
I tried very hard to reach you  
but I failed.

728
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:46,640
When all people in the world wish to live,

729
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:52,600
I’m a dead body  
who lives here wishing to die.

730
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:59,320
Yes, I’m a dead body living here.

731
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:06,480
This dead body speaks, roams , 
 eats and sleeps.

732
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:09,160
Always thinking about you.

733
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:28,080
Thanks , as you made me to be 
 together with Annam.

734
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,120
I'm In.
