1
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,594
Sometimes this thought
enters my heart

2
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:35,572
So loudly that you soil your pants

3
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,369
Sometimes this thought
enters my heart

4
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,379
So what enters your mind?

5
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,707
Tell me

6
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,808
Shut up. Quiet. Silence.

7
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,053
Sometimes this thought
enters my heart

8
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,453
Who am l?
- I know

9
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,530
You go to work and come home
every day

10
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:04,065
The boss yells at you.
You tell no one

11
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:11,004
You're one of hundreds,
packed in a crowded bus

12
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,110
Warning. The audience has arrived

13
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,510
Go. Go.

14
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,173
Hovv can I go without you?

15
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:23,514
We're connected.
inseparable, eternally

16
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,654
Live and die together

17
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,424
Two bodies, one soul

18
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:34,027
SOS SOS Charlie come
in Charlie Security

19
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,198
Forgive the poor chap

20
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:40,398
A nice guy like you.
But what to do?

21
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:45,735
He's stuck between the heart
and the world. Like you

22
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,674
There's more to come

23
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:53,141
You see I am here

24
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,345
His heart's voice

25
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,516
The heart skips a beat

26
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,688
What is a heart?

27
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,288
The heart! The heart!

28
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,998
Disruptive technology
A B theeta beeta gaama

29
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,504
Five hundred and seventy-five
methods, fester.

30
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,375
He's prepared a play for you

31
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,639
Straight from the heart

32
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,672
Clap if you like it

33
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,414
So? Are you sitting comfortably?

34
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,113
Shall we start?

35
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:54,441
He did so badly,
got the lowest marks

36
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,580
He can't solve the simplest problem

37
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,810
I understand that

38
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,385
Ask him what's wrong

39
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,549
Stories obsess him

40
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,444
Got the money?

41
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,538
Let's go

42
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,093
Half an hour

43
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,773
Many years ago

44
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,355
A million miles away, there was
a unique land

45
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:52,321
Made famous, not by the King,
but by the Prince

46
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,360
A rare Prince

47
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,261
The heartbeat of all

48
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,202
The apple of all eyes

49
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,201
Ayodhya sang His praises

50
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,270
But He chose e><i
e over throne

51
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,542
He who slayed the evil Ravaan...

52
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,510
...the one they call...

53
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,449
Hail shri Ram!

54
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,566
The forest is strewn with thorns,
my Queen

55
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:43,440
You're delicate, a Princess
The forest is not a place for you

56
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,314
All the world's comforts...

57
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,214
...mean nothing without you,
my Lord

58
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,023
With your hand in mine...

59
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:57,151
...thorns are flowers to me

60
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,060
Beware, Princess

61
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,398
The forest is as dangerous
as it is beautiful

62
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,702
Lakshman will protect you

63
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:11,141
I shall now hunt that deer

64
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,339
That's all

65
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,740
Half an hour. Go

66
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,981
What happens next?

67
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,119
End of story...money over Scoot!

68
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,118
A little more. Please

69
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,995
5 minutes

70
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,376
Are you done?

71
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,151
Grandma

72
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,694
"l shall now hunt that deer"

73
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,475
Where was l?

74
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,276
The evil Ravaan abducts Sita

75
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,014
When the noble king returned,
the Princess was gone

76
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,323
The evil king had taken her...

77
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,451
...across the seas to Troy

78
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,654
The King called all the Greek kings

79
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,426
Brothers!
Set sail a thousand ships

80
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,259
Fight the great Trojan vvar

81
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,699
Bring back my honour, my Helen

82
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,068
Wait!

83
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,999
Somethings wrong
- What?

84
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,337
You told me a different story
the last time

85
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:58,747
The demon king Ravaan carried
Sita away to Lanka

86
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,013
So what's the problem?

87
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,689
A story is a story

88
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,290
Same everywhere

89
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,392
In Ayodhya or in Greece

90
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,262
Laila- Ivlajnu. Romeo- Juliet.
Alexander's Victory

91
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,003
The Battle of Lanka

92
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,166
Your story too is like all stories

93
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,376
It's always the same story

94
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,979
Ignore the vvhy, the where
and the what

95
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,709
Take pleasure in the story

96
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,750
Are you comfortable?
Shall we begin?

97
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,146
The story begins with a rhythm

98
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,317
Starting from Time itself

99
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,292
Running free through words

100
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,431
A story within a love story

101
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,400
An age- old story

102
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,403
The story of our new love

103
00:09:56,229 --> 00:10:02,339
Who knows from where the story
flows or where it goes

104
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:39,045
Like the river Chenaab,
flowing with love

105
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:43,781
Sohni goes to Ivlahiwal

106
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:48,549
Her name was Sohni
And she belonged to Ivlahiwal

107
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,488
Scared of King

108
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:57,225
Vasudev crosses
the river with Krishana

109
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:03,158
Pharoah's sister picks
Moses from the river

110
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,785
So the day had come when...

111
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,648
...Sanyunkta had to get married.

112
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,391
Several rulers from
all over the vvor
d..

113
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,224
..had come to her palace,
to get married to her.

114
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,561
But she only liked
Prithvi Raj Chauhan.

115
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,760
And so the story flows on

116
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,454
Who does she go to?

117
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:05,002
Who calls her from beyond
society's confines?

118
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,307
With garland in hand...

119
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,200
...Sanjunkta comes out of the palace

120
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,370
Sayunkta!

121
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,213
Yamuna or Jamuna?

122
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,347
Joseph or Yusuf?

123
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,380
Jesus or Isa?

124
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,053
Moses or Ivlusa?
Tell me

125
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,719
Brahma or Abraham?

126
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,426
Or Ibrahim?

127
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,757
A Hindu river or Indus?

128
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,496
Hind or India?

129
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,432
It's Sanjukta

130
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,103
And so the story flows on

131
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,469
And so the story flows on

132
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,237
And so the story flows on

133
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,643
And so the story flows on

134
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,148
And so the story flows on

135
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:56,449
And so the story flows on

136
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,384
The story begins with a rhythm

137
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,685
From the start of Time itself

138
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,426
Running free through words

139
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,462
A story within a love story

140
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,566
An age- old story

141
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,536
The story of our new love

142
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:22,677
Who knows from where the story
flows or where it goes

143
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:35,055
Why suffer the pain of separation?

144
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:41,231
When it is you I see in my heart

145
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:47,229
I count each passing moment

146
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,602
Years have gone since
I gave myself to you

147
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:59,480
My eyes have been
shedding tears since morning

148
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:05,451
It's hard to describe
my love in words

149
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:12,027
Should I end my life or end
this distance?

150
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:17,598
Or fill this distance with
sweet memories of you?

151
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,105
"My heart's wrenching."

152
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,486
"
 will explain you how."

153
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,214
"Sita."

154
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,458
There's the flag of
rebellion soaring high

155
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,017
The Emperor feared...

156
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,427
...the Prince would fall in love

157
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,194
Bring shame to his name

158
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,099
Helen belonged to Troy

159
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,398
The undefeatable Raavan

160
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,803
A fierce battle cry

161
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,770
Ranjha belongs to you

162
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:03,339
The genie appeared before Aladdin

163
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,713
"Your wish is
my command, Master"

164
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,655
You are not listening to me...

165
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,291
I am not asking for money,

166
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,802
lam asking to make a call...
A phone call...

167
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,733
No no phone, go...

168
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,302
It'll be one second, okay?

169
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,534
l'll just call and quickly
ask them to call back.

170
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,042
No, no!

171
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,106
Please one phone call, please...

172
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,012
No no no money go

173
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,752
Bloody miser! Swine.

174

Thank you

175
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,320
Go, go

176
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,159
Please. . . please. ..

177
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,252
No money go

178
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,193
Fine

179
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:29,495
Bloody miser! Swine.
Die, you rascal

180
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,626
Thank you.. Go, go

181
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,652
Excuse me.

182
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,185
You said bloody miser?

183
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,225
I was just telling that.
- Swine.

184
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:04,234
To make one call,
it was just going to take one second.

185
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,402
Here.

186
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,730
I have to call India.

187
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,405
It's ok, go ahead

188
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,376
MY bags gone

189
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,014
Passport, phone, wallet

190
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,649
That bag one should never lose

191
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,547
Or someone stole it

192
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:29,321
I went back. I looked everywhere.
No one speaks English

193
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,192
Bloody Asteri>< in Corsica

194
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,688
Sorry.

195
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,026
I mean the Asteri>< comics

196
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,730
That's the reason actually.

197
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,430
"Asterix in Corsica,"
my favorite comic

198
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,101
I always thought I'd come here
one day

199
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,575
Phone first. OK?

200
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,284
Hi.
- Hi.

201
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,552
They'll call back, 0k?

202
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,188
Absolutely

203
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,462
Five minutes

204
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,595
<i>
'

</i> just...
- Yeah, sure.

205
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,467
By the way, thank you.
- Please, you don't have to do that.

206
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,739
No, I have to do it.

207
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,476
I was in a state

208
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,209
If you weren't there...

209
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,551
By the way, my name is..
- Stop.

210
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,148
One sec.

211
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,552
Pause.

212
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,157
You'll tell me your name,
l'll tell you mine

213
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,497
We become friends

214
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,370
Where we live, what we do Say:
"Wow! Small world!"

215
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,666
Mutual friends

216
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,707
I'll tell you old jokes.
Try impressing you

217
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,076
I'll behave decently

218
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,015
Behave decently? In Corsica?

219
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,049
Tough finding a place...

220
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,385
...where no one knows me.
I can be anyone, do anything

221
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,582
I'm Don!

222
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,294
The police from 12 countries
are looking for me and I wait here...

223
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,524
...for Teja's gold

224
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,662
And you?

225
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,461
Me?

226
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,371
Yes, you

227
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,035
You must have a name

228
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,138
I am Mona

229
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,208
Mona Darling

230
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,480
I work with Teja

231
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,546
Should I call you Mona or...

232
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,316
...Darling?

233
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,549

\/Ir Don

234
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,719
I like it

235
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,730
But hovv can I be sure that
you have the gold?

236
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:55,002
Hovv can I be sure that you're Don?

237
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,474
Proof is the law's thing

238
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,068
And Don doesn't play by those rules

239
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:06,072
May I ask why Teja isn't here?

240
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:11,148

\/Ir Teja has a dentist
appointment, sir

241
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:16,386
He's having root canal
treatment miles away

242
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,559
Interpol!

243
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,168
I'll handle it

244
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,132
Hello...

245
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,804
Yeah... dad...

246

Antoniya. ..
- Antoniya

259
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:39,227
Feeding the hungry was a
good move. But drinks too?

260
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,763
I don't know

261
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,803
Why? What do you plan to do?

262
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,217
I also don't know.

263
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,110
What is this place?

264
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,543
Where are we?

265
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,113
Shall I tell you?

266
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,278
At once upon a time...

267
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,117
A story begins

268
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,190
Will the story be good?

269
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,625
Always the same

270
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:43,498
Boy meets girl,
starts hitting on her

271
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,126
Like it's his duty

272
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,534
Tries to impress her

273
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,766
Makes some excuse...
touch, feel, hug, kiss

274
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,566
lam a boy, I'll play my role

275
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,804
I'll plot, create situations

276
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,044
To hell with Corsica!

277
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:01,209
Figure out hovv to touch you,
get physical

278
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:06,018
Oh no! Then I'll have to play
Miss Touch-me-not

279
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,082
Keep a safe distance from you

280
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:13,557
Then I'll have to behave

281
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,388
No.

282
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,400
Hold myself back

283
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,327
No, no

284
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,433
Hold back? In Corsica?

285
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,564
What to do?

286
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,109
Shame is a woman's wealth

287
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:31,581
I won't...

288
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,513
What?

289
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,572
...be a rascal

290
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,141
Move.

291
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:39,683
Don't hold back. I'll be good

292
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,285
You'll see

293
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,255
I give you my word

294
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,297
Understand?

295
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,398
"As long as I breath, honey"

296
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,736
My passport arrives in 7 days

297
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,671
I'm here for a week

298
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,110
I'll soon have cash

299
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,146
I'll be broke by then

300
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,608
No introductions

301
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,451
We could be anyone,
I don't know

302
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,218
No talking?

303
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,517
No talking the truth

304
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,698
Let's promise

305
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:26,297
We lie about our lives

306
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,406
Speak nothing but lies

307
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:34,308
And after Corsica,
we'll disappear. Magic!

308
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,637
Never meet again

309
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:41,140
A twist in the story.
A story like no other

310
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:45,080
So whatever happens,
happens here

311
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,382
And what happens in Corsica...

312
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,787
Stays in Corsica!

313
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:34,761
Strolling down the open road

314
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,337
Showing off big-time

315
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:42,209
Hail rained down on me

316
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,543
No umbrella to my rescue

317
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,174
Can't decide

318
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,379
Shall I run or get drenched?

319
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:55,722
And then I thought,
dry up what's soaked

320
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,360
Be it female or male

321
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:01,622
Attention

322
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:04,361
She played a new ruse

323
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,425
And tricked me again

324
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,098
Trapped me for no reason

325
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,265
Curse you, O life

326
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,571
She played a new ruse

327
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,101
And tricked me again

328
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,478
Trapped me for no reason

329
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,307
Curse you, O life

330
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,316
You know...

331
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,411
You're the one

332
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:55,243
I played tag with

333
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:59,286
You're Laila, Shirin, Sohni, Juliet

334
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,121
Don't seek me in the forest

335
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:06,061
I am on WhatsApp

336
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,001
This is not your era or my era

337
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,229
Not female or male

338
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:18,573
Take the bait

339
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,042
She played a new ruse

340
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,337
And tricked me again

341
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,746
Trapped me for no reason

342
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,015
Curse you, O life

343
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,361
You're the one who...

344
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:48,160
...tugged at my dhoti

345
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,106
Where do you seek me?
I'm not in Kaaba or Kashi

346
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,745
I am on Twitter

347
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:06,022
Listen, O beloved

348
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,415
My heart betrayed me

349
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:15,426
When I set eyes on you

350
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:20,402
I lost all senses

351
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:25,041
My weeping heart whispered

352
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:29,610
My eyes now speak for me

353
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:34,484
I see a new dream every day

354
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:40,047
My restless heart cries out

355
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,694
Don't hide behind that veil

356
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:49,132
A devoted lover...

357
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:53,636
...can only talk of love

358
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,400
The heart may lament

359
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,496
So...

360
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,509
Baby, I have news

361
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:45,316
The gold will be hidden
behind the lighthouse

362
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,485
And handed over to Don

363
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:51,824
Gorgeous 
\/Iona Darling
is handling the transfer

364
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,324
I'm sure you know the name

365
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:54,756
Where's Teja?

366
00:30:55,153 --> 00:31:00,626
Still at his dentist's

367
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,605
On behalf of Interpol,
I'll arrest the lot

368
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,005
Unarmed

369
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:12,146
The time is right, baby

370
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:17,484
If you trust me, then follow me

371
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:25,492
I wonder what secrets
are hidden in the case

372
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,052
It's so heavy

373
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,731
A little burden scares you?

374
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:32,530
I'm from Interpol.
It's my duty to tell you

375
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:36,630
Your beautiful valley is visible

376
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,054
So now what?

377
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,086

Why did you call me here?

00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,625
What utter nonsense!
I'm an Interpol officer

380
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,035
Don't Interpol officers have a pole?

381
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,630
Disgusting!

Say it

391
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:27,345
What is it? Why so sad?

392
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,083
You're usually so cheerful

393
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,190

00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,038
Not here

398
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,738
Home is ok

399
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,582
Packed like sardines

400
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,044
Do your own thing

401
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:07,750
- I'm all yours
- Hand is God

402
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:12,993
- Sister by day, wife by night
- Wife by night?

403
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:19,067

Buy me a drink?

00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:30,326
And hovv do you say
"Will you take me out this evening".

415
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,059
Excuse me.

Welcome to India, Sambar-vada,
Medu-vada, Pav-vada

00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,096
Very, very nice. Namaste

00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,313
What must I do?
Beg on the streets?

419
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,290
Beg for aims?

420
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:07,028
You shou
d've thought about
that before betting

421
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:11,431
Look. Can you see an expensive
restaurant nearby?

422
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,697
God, if only
You had made me a girl...

423
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,966
...
 would've sold my honour
to feed this glutton

424
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,043
What do I do?

425
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,705
Are you listening, God?

426
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,145
You're too cool, God

427
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,548
Come on.

428
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,618
What's the plan?
- Don't know

429
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:44,428
Padre. Padre.

430
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:48,260
She's a movie star

431
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,770
Ivladhubala making a picture
in Corsica

432
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,570
Welcome. Please come.

433
00:38:57,636 --> 00:39:00,207
Please come.
Come, come, enjoy.

434
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,246
Welcome.

435
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,452
What a lovely dinner.

436
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:08,447
Merci! Merci!

437
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:12,461
But I will only be happy
if he cast me in his ne><t movie.

438
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:18,190
Mousier Director, why don't
you tell them about your latest story?

439
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,201
You wi

440
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:25,266
Bravo. Big Indian movie director

00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,139
Bravo. Bravo.

442
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,609
And then he put the gun to his head.

443
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,742
And he said I'm going to kill you,
prepare to die.

444
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:38,009
And she said, Merci..

445
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:42,456
Thank you God for
answering my prayers.

446
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:44,425
For one year I tried to kill myself.

447
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,395
I shoot myself Bang‘...
and the chandelier fell.

448
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:48,430
I miss.

449
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,159
Then I take poison to die.

450
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,031
Ne><t morning
I wake up with hangover.

451
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,594
Mama mia...then I cut my vein.

452
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,198
I still no die.

453
00:39:57,262 --> 00:40:00,141
I get infection,
doctor give me seven injections.

454
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,672
My ass is soar.

455
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,003
Now God send you...

456
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,412
Hurry up, kill me. Shoot me now.

457
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,420
But vvait...
 have to pi-pi..

458
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,021
First I pi-pi then you kill me.

459
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,457
What does it matter?

460
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:20,429
Once I die I have no pi-pi,
shoot me now.

461
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:22,465
What if you kill me 'Boom'..

462
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,557
..and I pee on your shoe.

463
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,791
Ooh la-la...what a lovely shoe.

464
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:28,596
What brand shoe?

465
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,730
Jimmy-chu.

466
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:31,536
Armani?

467
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:32,801
I am tired of talking.

468
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,134
Pardon me, where's the wine?

469
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,542
Where?

470
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,641
Salute.

471
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,681
Pretty, pretty girls...

472
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,522

473
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,529
No, no, no girlfriend.

474
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:56,361
Yes... lvladhubala...free.

475
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,367
Ivladhubala available.

476
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:03,194
And in my heart...
there is lot of love, amore.

477
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,468
I want to give you love, come...

478
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,531
Take it.

479
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,670
Praise the Lord.
He has come to redeem us

480
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:48,047
He has come to save us
from our foes

481
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:51,178
Show mercy to our ancestors,
remember his Holy covenant

482
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,080
Thank you very much

483
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,233
What?

484
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:50,701
Just looking

485
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:56,040
That's allowed.
Remember our vow

486
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,206
Vvhy?

487
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:04,584
See?

488
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,088
That's all you get

489
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,127
You upset?

490
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:15,153
Your carnal desires
are weakening our oath

491
00:44:15,553 --> 00:44:17,055
What to do?

492
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:21,370
Once we make a commitment

493
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:26,535
Don't be disheartened, Princess

494
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:30,008
Why just ‘ting?
We can 'tong' too

495
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,182
What a fun

496
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,547
Fun hasjust begun, baby.

497
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,280
There's more we can do

498
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:40,112
For example

499
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,589
ls this allowed?
- Why not?

500
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:53,101
And even...

501
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,368
...this is allowed

502
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,344
Sure it's allowed?

503
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,138
Why not? Why not?

504
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,450
No crossing the line

505
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,519
So can I do this?

506
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,722
And this too

507
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,501
The line is drawing close

508
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,436
But we won't cross it

509
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,401
Sure?

510
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:37,145
I gave you my word

511
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,552
I gave you my heart. And all
you gave me was your word

512
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:50,158
This heart will mean nothing
in the ne><t world, Zohra Bai

513
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:51,485
Alas!

514
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:57,355
Rules and regulations are
so different there

515
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,168
What do we do?

516
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:04,467
Shall we run away?

517
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,045
Run! Run!

518
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,079
Why does this always happen?

519
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,554
Good times pass so quickly

520
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,255
What if Sohni just never
returns home?

521
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:28,760
Can she stay?

522
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:37,532
A day early’?

523
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,703
There were a few phone-calls
from the ministry in New Delhi.

524
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,134
You can tell me when
you want to fly out.

525
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,106
There is a flight tomorrow.

526
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,128
What time's the flight?

527
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,511
Good bye.

528
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,720
The airport is an hour away

529
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,306
We'll never meet again

530
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,755
Heer is very sad

531
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:44,550
She's so upset these days

532
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:47,221
Heer is very sad

533
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,730
She's so upset these days

534
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,365
Doesn't eat or drink

535
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:54,994
Can't even complain

536
00:49:55,226 --> 00:50:00,107
The embers of love
have singed her

537
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:09,545
Hovv to face these embers again?

538
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:16,081
Heer's state,
I swear by God

539
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,022
ls a very bad state

540
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,529
Heer is very sad

541
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,156
She's so upset these days

542
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,259
Heer is very sad

543
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:46,186
Love is a matchstick,
the heart is diesel

544
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,723
Best to keep them apart

545
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,385
Thorns piercing vision

546
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:54,328
Shattering all dreams

547
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:59,395
Heer's song is broken

548
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,993
Who can enjoy the melody?

549
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,562
She once spoke so freely

550
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:07,268
Now utters not a word

551
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:11,108
People say she's senile

552
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:17,079
So utterly mad

553
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:19,621
Heer is very sad

554
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:22,351
Heer is very sad

555
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:25,622
She's so upset these days

556
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,315
Her heart plays
a tuneless tune

557
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,119
She looks pale

558
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:34,721
Her mind is like
a pressure cooker

559
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,635
To hell with life

560
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,296
She sleeps to kill Time

561
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,771
She blames Time

562
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:47,566
Keeps punching it in the face

563
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:51,477
Even her Dad is so worried now

564
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:57,219
Mom is sad too

565
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,684
Heer is really very mad

566
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,383
Yes, she's very mad

567
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:05,086
And none too glad too

568
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:07,652
Doesn't eat or drink

569
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,222
Can't even complain

570
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:14,994
The embers of love have singed her

571
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:25,078
Hovv to face these embers again?

572
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:31,484
Heer's state, I swear by God

573
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,216
ls a very bad state

574
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:37,020
Heer is very sad

575
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,584
She's so upset these days

576
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,529
Heer is very sad

577
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:32,299
If you look at point
no.3 in the presentation.

578
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:34,569
..you'

 see that
for this strategy to work,

579
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:36,373
we'll probably need
to get some e><pertise..

580
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,242
..and hire some technical people.

581
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:40,145
So I mean we should go back.

582
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:41,342
Excuse me, please.
- Sure.

583
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:43,476
Excuse me. Excuse me.

584
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,076
Hi.

Remember?

586
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,321
Corsica! Oh my, God.

587
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:54,795
You? Here?

588
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:58,461
I come here often.
You're from Delhi

589
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,227
We decided never to meet again

590
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,332
What now?

591
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,066
What shall we do?

592
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,179
Ved

593
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:13,079
Ved?

594
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:15,140
Like Rig Ved?

595
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:19,414
Tara Ivlaheshwari

596
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:21,489
Ved Vardhan Sahni

597
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,453
Your real name?

Listen

601
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,502
This is no coincidence.
I was pretending

602
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:42,542
I've often come here
because I know you do

603
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,771
I came to Delhi from Kolkata
on an assignment

604
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:50,046
I couldn't stop myself

605
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:52,678
Listen...don't. It's fine

606
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,717
Really?
- Yeah, really.

607
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:57,556
There's more

608
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,056
9K8)’-

After you.

611
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:15,037
You know since
I came back from Corsica...

612
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,144
...
 thought it'd be ok, usually is

613
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,119
I don't know what it is

614
00:57:25,509 --> 00:57:27,511
All this love and all

615
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:30,752
I thought hovv stupid I am

616
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:35,361
Why do I always behave
like this with you?

617
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:44,770
Your friends are waiting

618
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:50,101
Give me 5 minutes?
- Sure

619
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,501

00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:00,010
Don't psych yourself out.
I'm not a crazy stalker

622
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,488
I promise you, I won't pile on

623
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:06,619
I know you have a life.
Probably a girlfriend too

624
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:10,392
I don't have a girlfriend

625
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,262
Oh, okay.

626
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:15,126
Five minutes

627
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,039
You did well

628
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:22,334
Be right back

629
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:16,722

Yeah.

647
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:23,657
Japanese cuisine is so popular, no?

648
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:27,532
What a brand. Japan!

649
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:35,268
Countries are the latest companies,
and Companies are the latest Countries.

650

Have some.

651
01:00:50,414 --> 01:00:51,722

01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:58,222
Great

654
01:00:58,755 --> 01:00:59,756

656
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,530
Yeah! Why’?

657
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:07,265
No, just asking.

Nice place.

661
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:42,200
There are four apartments like this?

662
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,113
So?

663
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,150
So?

665
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,192
One sec...

666
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,473
I am sorry.

9K8)’-

Good morning, sir!

676
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:13,560
The CSB focus
of the recent tradewinds.

677
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,570
..rests in the lateral
shift of consumer behavior.

678
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:20,370
..vvhich may appear bi-polar, but it
does not take an Einstein to co-re
ate..

679
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,410
Granted that we cannot
un-google ourselves.

680
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:25,447
..from the geometrical
growth of social-media.

681
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:27,106
Why do you get nervous?

682
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:30,646
Ne><t time don't get nervous.
- Okay, sir.

683
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:33,278
You can do it, boy.
- Thank you, sir.

01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:43,061

Good.

688
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:53,536
My plan?
You'll decide that

689
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,269
9K8)’-

690
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:09,614
So this is it, huh!

691
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:13,220
This is what they say...
love and all.

692

01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,372
Why are we standing?
Everyone's waiting...

694

Come, 80..

695
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,798
Hero, nothing today?

Good morning, sir.

697
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:01,736
Good morning, sir.

698
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:03,443
I would say Glo-cal.

699
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,308
Global, yet local.

700
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,080
This out-of-the-box strategy. .

701
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:08,741
..fo

ows a bottom-upward approach.

702
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:11,310

01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,583
Good, could be better.

Please tell the driver
to come by in half an hour.

Sir.
- Yes, boy.

708
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,020
Ta ra

709
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,166
I won't say meet my "boss."
I'd say meet my "guru"

710
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:29,764
Hello.
- Hello.

711
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:35,572

His vision, his philosophy has
changed the face of Indian telecom.

714
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:43,773
Totally.

715
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:48,188
Good human in today times

716
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,348

720
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:18,552
Happy birthday to you.

721
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:21,089
Guys, she's coming.

722
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,075
One sec, Ved.

723
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:54,446
Can we step out for a minute?

724
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,387
What's wrong?

725
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,126
Just come out, please.

726
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,077
Excuse us...

727
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:37,721
Yeah.

728
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:47,505
Ved, since I've returned
from Corsica...

729
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:50,503
It's like.

730
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:53,781
It's like you're with me

731
01:07:58,141 --> 01:07:59,347
You understand?

732
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:03,454
I don't know your name

733
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:10,631
No hope we'd meet again.
But I am with you

734
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:16,230
ls it possible? To feel like this?

735
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:20,472
I never knew

736
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,444
Then you found me

737
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:27,579
l\lo

738
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:33,447
I found a product manager
who lives in a city

739
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:38,250
Who is very well behaved.
Polite, decent

740
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:42,260
But...

741
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:49,261
Tara, I am a product manager.
I do live in a city

742
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,271
I am not Don, Tara

743
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,667
Nor a movie director

744
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,308
That was play-acting.
Role playing

745
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:06,481
This is the real me

746
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,213
l\lo

747
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:10,313
Meaning?

748
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:15,621
You're Don,
and the Interpol officer

749
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:18,566
You're acting here

750
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:23,135
Now you're playing the role of
a regular guy

751
01:09:24,127 --> 01:09:26,198
Who follows a set pattern

752
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:32,469
Who does things as he ought to.
It's not you, Ved

753
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,409
All fake

754
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,217
You stick your face in the
river and drink like a beast

755
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:45,049
You talk to the mountains.
That's you, Ved

756
01:09:47,317 --> 01:09:48,990
What's with you?

757
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,329
What's with you, Tara?

758
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:05,340
Who is that? He's no one.
It's all in your head

759
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,781
Maybe you have imagined
that's me

760
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,112
This is me, Tara

761
01:10:15,445 --> 01:10:18,221
Standing here before you

762
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:19,755
This is all I am

763
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,523
Sure?

764
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:25,657
Tara.

765
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:28,294
Yes, I am sure, Tara

766
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,403
Then I'm with someone else, Ved

767
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,814
I am looking for something else

768
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:47,317
I already have this

769
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,489
I don't want this

770
01:11:00,557 --> 01:11:01,661
It's a mess now

771
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:06,539
Everything is ruined

772
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:10,605
But it's happened

773
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:20,539
Hi... So I am back...

774
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:28,080
There are things we must sort out

775
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:31,883
It's like this...

776
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,323
It's fine, okay...?

777
01:12:35,785 --> 01:12:37,992
Please... let's relax...

778
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,002
It's okay...

779
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:45,938
Let's order the main course

780
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:48,765
Excuse me...

781
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:05,153
Look, boss, you've two options

782
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,252
Become Ivlajnu

783
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:12,095
Rip your clothes off and scream

784
01:13:13,323 --> 01:13:15,132
Or stay cool

785
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:21,397
You know vvhat...
'

 stay cool

786
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:25,305
Yeah... It's all good.

787
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:29,914
It wasn't going to work

788
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,977
What had to happen -
happens hovv

789
01:13:34,043 --> 01:13:35,545
It's fine

790
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:38,420
No tension now

791
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:41,790
Good.

792
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:44,257
Set.

793
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,468
Hey Raju...

794
01:13:56,065 --> 01:13:57,738
Good Morning... good morning...

795
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:58,809
Good Morning...

796
01:13:58,835 --> 01:13:59,939
Hovv are things?

797
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:12,091
We're going to the movies tonight

798
01:14:12,482 --> 01:14:13,893
Coming?

799
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,022
We'll have a beer later

800
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,931
Where?

801
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,766
At the same pub we went to
after your breakup?

802
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:26,098
Why not why not...?

803
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:29,442
My girl dumped me.
Something good must happen

804
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:31,438
Keep me amused!

805
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,776
That's right.

806
01:14:36,372 --> 01:14:39,910
I was waiting for you to feel better

807
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:42,052
But you look perfectly fine

808
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:43,323
So here

809
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,952
You forgot this at the restaurant

810
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:49,757
Saved me thousands

811
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,398
Never seen him this happy

812
01:14:53,456 --> 01:14:55,060
Someone help me break up too

813
01:14:55,124 --> 01:14:57,331
No problem
- And me!

814
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,877
Sorry, it's very late

815
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,236
It's okay..

816
01:15:07,303 --> 01:15:08,782
But I was just...

817
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,916
Come in
- No

818
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:15,088
I won't take time. I was thinking...

819
01:15:20,817 --> 01:15:24,355
I mean...you...instead of...

820
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:33,101
Ved, look at me

821
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,203
What is it?

822
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,803
Tell me Ved...

823
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:42,879
It's not what you think

824
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:46,078
Nothing important
- Then say it

825
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:47,344
<i>9K8)’</i>

826
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:50,424
You see it was different in Corsica

827
01:15:50,446 --> 01:15:54,451
We promised we'd lie.
Here you didn't have to

828
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:55,923
What?
- The truth!

829
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,764
You cou
d've told me the truth

830
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,873
Ved, come inside
- I'm not here to come inside

831
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:10,502
You shou
d've said I was not
on your level

832
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:11,408
Ved...

833
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:15,745
I don't know what you thought
of me in Corsica. But here?

834
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:18,350
You know what I am

835
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,444
A normal person. Ordinary

836
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:21,783
Ved, one second

837
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:24,758
I'm ordinary
- That's the issue, Ved

838
01:16:24,814 --> 01:16:27,454
I am average. Like them all

839
01:16:27,517 --> 01:16:30,396
Walking on the street, with briefcase

840
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:31,864
Ved. ..
- Mediocre

841
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:35,368
That's what I said, Ved.
You're not that

842
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,835
I know who you are

843
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:39,772
5*! You know, but no one else does

844
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:42,776
My family, friends.
Don't know myself, but you...

845
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:02,763
No it's not fine Tara...

846
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:04,186
Hovv could l?

847
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,291
It's good to let it out

848
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:09,358
What's there to let out?

849
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,033
Ved, just come.
- I am very sorry

850
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:15,033
I'm really really sorry.

851
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,008
Let it go Ved... It's fine...

852
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,073
Come inside

853
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,911
I shouldn't come inside

854
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:25,142
I didn't come here to patch up

855
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:27,812
No sense standing out here

856
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:30,850
It's late. People must be asleep

857
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:35,763
l'll wake them because I'm nuts.
l'll scream, make a racket

858
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:37,058
Make a scene

859
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,963
Take me inside. Hide me

860
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:41,467
Anything to control this beast

861
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:08,091
You're my life

862
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:12,758
You're m)’ JOY

863
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:17,864
Hairstyle is terrific, boss

864
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:20,468
Hairstyle

865
01:18:20,897 --> 01:18:22,137
Hairstyle

866
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:28,077
Joining the movies?
- I wanted to

867
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:30,448
Sure, I did

868
01:18:30,907 --> 01:18:33,444
Do it. What's the problem?

869
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:36,986
Only one problem

870
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:39,083
Circumstances

871
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:44,758
Parents did their duty,
got me married

872
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:48,101
I did the needful, had two kids

873
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:51,137
The wheel of time turns

874
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:56,302
Food, children's education,
wife's demands

875
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,211
The traffic, this rickshaw

876
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:01,045
You wanted to act?

877
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:04,243
To sing

878
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:09,388
You couldn't guess from my looks

879
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:13,922
But when I sang on stage
in Allahabad...

880
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,259
...the audience went crazy

881
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:20,092
They wouldn't let me stop

882
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:22,994
So you're a hero

883
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:25,399
No, sir

884
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:27,270
I'm just a rickshaw driver

885
01:19:29,165 --> 01:19:32,510
Not a damn soul knows me

886
01:19:34,737 --> 01:19:38,981
Inside, I am another man.
Outside, I'm powerless

887
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:48,025
Maths

888
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:50,860
I don't get Maths

889
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:53,398
Can't get the hang of it

890
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:55,234
Go on

891
01:19:55,925 --> 01:20:00,101
I don't vvant to study
engineering, actually

892
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,233
It's not me, Papa

893
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:05,742
I am not interested. So...

894
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:10,706
When your grandpa came
here after the Partition...

895
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,045
...he had zero

896
01:20:14,944 --> 01:20:16,924
No roof over his head

897
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:20,123
And a family of 8 to feed

898
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:25,459
If he had said: "
'm not
interested in working in a factory

899
01:20:26,222 --> 01:20:29,897
"lt's not me,
actually, I want to play the flute"

900
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:33,997
Could the family have survived?

901
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:37,967
Would you have the chance
of doing engineering?

902
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:41,345
After two years of training...

903
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:44,851
...you couldn't even pass the
entrance e><am

904
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:47,744
You wasted a year at home

905
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:51,182
You're getting admission now
thanks to my donation

906
01:20:51,781 --> 01:20:56,355
You should be grateful.
Work harder out of shame

907
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,256
But what interests you?

908
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:04,167
Sitting under trees, telling stories
at 10- rupees an hour

909
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:06,196
Want to be a movie star?

910
01:21:06,896 --> 01:21:12,471
What is your career plan?
Speak up!

911
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:31,364
Locking eyes
with dazzling damsels

912
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:38,103
Trying to lure lovely chicks

913
01:21:41,864 --> 01:21:50,249
Locking eyes
with dazzling damsels

914
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:59,486
Trying to lure lovely chicks

915
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:01,454
O beauty...

916
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:07,195
Doing my duty, hitting on you

917
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:13,532
I've left decency behind

918
01:22:13,796 --> 01:22:16,868
Inviting trouble on myself

919
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:24,813
I'm in hot water, thanks to you

920
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:36,822
Locking eyes
with dazzling damsels

921
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:42,795
Trying to lure lovely chicks

922
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:05,389
Spending time talking
about you to myself

923
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:08,894
Laughing to myself,
crying to myself

924
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:12,057
Torturing myself

925
01:23:12,121 --> 01:23:18,800
They all mock me because
of you

926
01:23:18,861 --> 01:23:26,006
Me? Who strutted about proudly

927
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:36,179
What next? The usual

928
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:41,418
The same old story.
Ivlajnu rips off his clothes

929
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:43,430
Makes a scene in public

930
01:23:43,986 --> 01:23:53,202
Thinking to himself:
"Why. . .where. ..sunny. . . money"

931
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,900
Without money, hovv would it be?

932
01:23:57,233 --> 01:24:00,442
Just think! Forget boring facts

933
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:02,311
Be happy, eat well

934
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,317
Lock horns, walk the gallows.
Tear your clothes, untie knots

935
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:07,513
Whip the cream, tell the tale

936
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:11,781
Entertain them all.
Make noise, shake hips

937
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:16,989
Pour out the silver and gold
of your heart. I surrender to you

938
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,760
Just for you

939
01:24:19,288 --> 01:24:24,328
Your slave, master, wearing a tie.
In the lift, coming to you

940
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:27,101
Doing again what I do
every day

941
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:30,502
Doing it again and again
and again

942
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:36,042
Sometimes it's your story.
Sometimes another's

943
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,375
What's in your heart?

944
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:44,114
The colour of your heart?
What does it seek?

945
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:46,151
Tell me

946
01:24:46,982 --> 01:24:48,052
Answer me

947
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,729
Sorry, Papa
- No, son, my donation

948
01:24:54,056 --> 01:24:56,764
You realise, that's enough

949
01:24:57,893 --> 01:24:59,839
I am proud of you my son...

950
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:03,909
I know you'll do well in college

951
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,811
All the best...

952
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:15,416
The flowers in your hair have
robbed the very life from me

953
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:21,393
Your every move has ensnared me

954
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:28,390
Tell me where are you
leading me

955
01:25:28,424 --> 01:25:35,000
Slowly but surely
you've done me in

956
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:43,244
Locking eyes
with dazzling damsels

957
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:53,154
Trying to lure lovely chicks

958
01:25:54,183 --> 01:26:02,830
Locking eyes
with dazzling damsels

959
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:20,377
I pray you get your dream girl

960
01:26:21,477 --> 01:26:22,820
Thank you

961
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:27,286
Good morning

962
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,285
Morning

963
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:33,288
Good morning sir

964
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:36,462
Where's your tie?

965
01:26:37,426 --> 01:26:38,928
Forgot it?

966
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:40,967
Tivvari

967
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:43,032
It's okay boss...

968
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:44,368
It's okay...?

969
01:26:45,467 --> 01:26:46,775
It's okay...?

970
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:52,345
We're hardly selling the tie

971
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:55,114
Put it on!

972
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,123
Gone nuts, all for a girl

973
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:01,759
Hurry up...

974
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:06,493
...it is finally our core values
that will harness the seismic shift

975
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:09,463
because technology epiphanies
are not a result of a packed like sardines

976
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:12,399
Eureka Moment they
are systematically produced

977
01:27:12,461 --> 01:27:14,270
and the Devil is in the detail
what difference does it mane

978
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:17,401
plus the Blue Ocean Strategy
is call it what you want IP driven

979
01:27:17,466 --> 01:27:20,106
and favors the backward
integration process

980
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:22,239
Why, sir? I wasn't nervous today

981
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:23,840
Not the point

982
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:27,219
The client looks happy

983
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:30,983
You were talking crazy stuff

984
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:32,915
Crazy stuff?

985
01:27:36,785 --> 01:27:38,287
Anyway...
- Okay sir

986
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:39,999
Anyway...

987
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:43,460
and sector agnostic though
it looks from the outside,

988
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,932
from the inside it
is not only hello hello Charlie

989
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:49,237
consistent to our corporate
DNA but also organic to the

990
01:27:49,298 --> 01:27:51,744
new drivers of economy
Patparganj and since...

991
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,711
all points of convergence
are known to us-

992
01:27:54,236 --> 01:27:56,045
Very amused, right?

993
01:27:57,172 --> 01:27:59,448
Yes!

994
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:03,290
You know you'll get sc

995
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:05,250
Badly

996
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:08,921
You'll get sc*

997
01:28:12,154 --> 01:28:13,292
Bastard

998
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:17,363
It's come to this

999
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:22,298
Went nuts over a girl

1000
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:28,771
Ved..

1001
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:29,740
Hi, Tara

1002
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:32,005
Sorry, I saw your missed calls

1003
01:29:32,267 --> 01:29:36,010
Hovv are you?
- Absolutely fine. You?

1004
01:29:36,305 --> 01:29:37,841
Can we meet?

1005
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,310
Vvhy?

1006
01:29:39,341 --> 01:29:40,752
I want to see you

1007
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:43,253
That's not why I called

1008
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:46,090
I just wanted to apologise

1009
01:29:46,148 --> 01:29:47,991
I want to see you, Ved

1010
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:50,824
What is it? I'm fine

1011
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,028
Where are you now, Ved?

1012
01:29:54,089 --> 01:29:55,261
Can I come over?

1013
01:29:56,358 --> 01:29:58,360
I'll wait, if you're busy

1014
01:29:59,294 --> 01:30:00,295
(Dk

1015
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:18,123
l—li

1016
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,191
on, m

1017
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:24,987
Dicey, eh?

1018
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:29,501
Should we? Yes, no?

1019
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,234
Better

1020
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,409
Hello, hovv are you?

1021
01:30:46,074 --> 01:30:48,076
I won't do anything crazy

1022
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:52,123
What did I do the other day?

1023
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:56,118
Ved...

1024
01:30:58,887 --> 01:31:01,265
I came here to tell you
it's my fault

1025
01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:03,892
How?

1026
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,362
Because you rejected me?

1027
01:31:07,329 --> 01:31:12,005
Because I said something...

1028
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,943
...acting too smart

1029
01:31:16,438 --> 01:31:19,078
It disturbed you

1030
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:23,755
I think I touched a raw nerve
in you

1031
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:26,459
I want to say sorry

1032
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:31,823
Then say it

1033
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:36,295
Say sorrY

1034
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:40,397
Go on, say it

1035
01:31:43,265 --> 01:31:44,903
What are you?

1036
01:31:45,767 --> 01:31:48,475
A psychiatrist?
Am I your patient?

1037
01:31:48,737 --> 01:31:49,374
I'm concerned

1038
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:51,348
That's mighty helpful

1039
01:31:51,406 --> 01:31:52,180
WOW !

1040
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,220
I'm feeling well these days

1041
01:31:54,276 --> 01:31:55,846
Great, thanks

1042
01:31:55,911 --> 01:31:57,948
Ved, I'm sorry

1043
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:03,486
I take back everything I said
to you the other day

1044
01:32:06,288 --> 01:32:08,495
Where's the ring? I want it

1045
01:32:15,397 --> 01:32:18,344
Everyone can see hovv happy I am

1046
01:32:20,302 --> 01:32:21,474
Ved.

1047
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:23,777
Don't get physical

1048
01:32:23,972 --> 01:32:27,181
Leave it, Tara
- Please, Ved, sit down

1049
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:31,017
You're in love, crazy girl

1050
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,318
Yes, Ved

1051
01:32:36,118 --> 01:32:37,791
But with someone else

1052
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:43,298
You belong to someone else,
O muse of poetry

1053
01:32:44,226 --> 01:32:45,762
Tara, listen

1054
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:49,338
I can't predict my reactions

1055
01:32:49,398 --> 01:32:52,277
So I'll go
- What have I done wrong?

1056
01:32:52,334 --> 01:32:53,836
Sorry

1057
01:32:55,337 --> 01:32:57,374
You're so great, Tara

1058
01:32:58,106 --> 01:33:02,282
I could worship you

1059
01:33:06,348 --> 01:33:07,326
See...

1060
01:33:07,883 --> 01:33:11,797
...what I become
when I'm around you?

1061
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:14,062
Your negativity

1062
01:33:14,122 --> 01:33:15,760
Ved, it's a passing phase

1063
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:19,033
It'll be fine
- Stay away from me

1064
01:33:19,194 --> 01:33:20,298
I might do something

1065
01:33:20,362 --> 01:33:22,865
That's the problem

1066
01:33:23,465 --> 01:33:25,240
I can't stay away from you

1067
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:28,412
Betraying your true love?

1068
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:30,416
Ved seriously...

1069
01:33:30,472 --> 01:33:31,951
No, seriously, Tara

1070
01:33:32,007 --> 01:33:34,783
You're compromising. Right?

1071
01:33:35,477 --> 01:33:37,184
Wait. Don will return

1072
01:33:37,512 --> 01:33:39,355
He'll come back some day

1073
01:33:39,414 --> 01:33:40,552
Wait for him

1074
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:42,222
Ved
- Tara

1075
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:44,389
I promise I'll make things right

1076
01:33:44,453 --> 01:33:47,195
Don't you get it? Let me go

1077
01:33:47,255 --> 01:33:49,030
I won't let you go

1078
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:59,303
Stay still, let the moment pass

1079
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:03,305
Let the heart settle

1080
01:34:03,905 --> 01:34:10,413
But hovv do I stop you?

1081
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:18,963
My sorrows would slip away

1082
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:25,463
If you let me fill my eyes
with you

1083
01:34:26,895 --> 01:34:33,904
Talk to you without words

1084
01:34:34,135 --> 01:34:39,778
If you were by my side

1085
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:46,156
If you were by my side

1086
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:07,380
Flowing as one

1087
01:35:10,405 --> 01:35:13,113
Like a lake and river

1088
01:35:14,409 --> 01:35:19,409
Your world makes my world

1089
01:35:26,121 --> 01:35:32,766
I will mould myself in your image

1090
01:35:32,794 --> 01:35:37,072
If you were by my side

1091
01:35:37,132 --> 01:35:41,012
Your eyes hold your dreams

1092
01:35:41,036 --> 01:35:44,916
Dreams full of disappointment

1093
01:35:44,973 --> 01:35:48,853
You believe that feelings
of the heart...

1094
01:35:48,877 --> 01:35:52,723
are merely deceitful words

1095
01:35:52,781 --> 01:35:56,729
If you were or not by my side

1096
01:35:56,785 --> 01:36:00,358
Doesn't matter

1097
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:04,370
Life was cruel

1098
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:07,872
And still is

1099
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:12,139
If you were by my side

1100
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:15,477
Let the heart settle

1101
01:36:15,737 --> 01:36:19,310
If you were by my side

1102
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:23,248
Every sorrow would slip-away

1103
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:27,953
If you were by my side

1104
01:36:28,016 --> 01:36:31,088
These days would pass

1105
01:36:31,152 --> 01:36:35,498
If you were by my side

1106
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:39,062
ls it all right, boss?

1107
01:37:39,487 --> 01:37:40,488
Okay sir.

1108
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:41,761
Shyamji Jewellers?

1109
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:43,927
I'm returning the diamond ring

1110
01:37:43,992 --> 01:37:46,268
It can't lose value

1111
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:48,864
Charge the ne><t buyer

1112
01:37:48,930 --> 01:37:50,170
You have no heart

1113
01:37:50,899 --> 01:37:52,469
Good morning

1114
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:54,742
Good morning

Give me something!

such a kind man...

1123
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:35,081
...in the current socio-political
climate where consumer is king

1124

and companies are the new

01:39:08,009 --> 01:39:09,386
What's happening to me?

1133
01:39:10,845 --> 01:39:12,381
Somethings wrong

1134
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:15,155
Sure, somethings wrong

1135
01:39:16,351 --> 01:39:20,231
But sir, this job is all I have

1136
01:39:21,089 --> 01:39:22,397
I don't want to lose it, sir

1137
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:29,173
Listen, boy, your behavior is
always A- 1

1138
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:34,435
Your work is average.
Yet you survived all these years

1139
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:37,013
Only on good behaviour

1140
01:39:37,872 --> 01:39:41,979
You're decent,
polite, nice...everyone likes you

1141
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:43,845
And you're doing this?

1142
01:39:44,913 --> 01:39:46,392
All for that girl

1143
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:49,886
What is there so much in
that girl?

1144
01:39:53,388 --> 01:39:56,392
Everyone has a weak moment

1145
01:39:57,892 --> 01:39:59,769
Even I do

1146
01:40:04,098 --> 01:40:07,944
I have a weak moment.
So what do I do?

1147
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:11,045
I put in more effort

1148
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:13,342
More focus, focus!

1149
01:40:15,276 --> 01:40:16,880
And you've a bright future

1150

You could be the Company's
VP in five years

1152
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:25,328
WOW !

1153
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:28,027
And if things go vvell...

1154
01:40:28,289 --> 01:40:30,792
...you may have my seat

1155
01:40:30,925 --> 01:40:32,029
Yes, why not?

1156
01:40:32,226 --> 01:40:34,934
In 15 years you could be like me

1157
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:37,505
Oh, s* No!

1158
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:39,767
It is possible

1159
01:40:39,834 --> 01:40:44,044
Impossible! Tell me it's a lie

1160
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:49,821
No!

1161
01:40:58,753 --> 01:41:00,892
You're going to yell again

1162
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:08,798
Now go for it, boy

1163
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:12,471
Send security

1164
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:35,026
I was very wrong.
Can you forgive me?

1165
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:38,835
Tell me. Say it

1166
01:41:39,394 --> 01:41:41,067
Can you forgive me?

1167
01:41:42,063 --> 01:41:43,940
Please sir!

1168
01:41:46,467 --> 01:41:48,344
Will you forgive me or not?

1169
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:01,786
Go on, forgive me

1170
01:42:03,818 --> 01:42:04,956
Raju

1171
01:42:06,921 --> 01:42:09,925
Won't you forgive me?

1172
01:42:12,093 --> 01:42:15,006
Security! Throw this man
out of the office

1173
01:42:18,166 --> 01:42:22,376
I'll ruin you, ruin you

1174
01:42:55,770 --> 01:43:04,986
The beauty is here to face
punishment for loving him

1175
01:43:09,984 --> 01:43:16,959
May no one throw a stone...
at my crazed one

1176
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:26,808
What's happening, boss?

1177
01:43:34,175 --> 01:43:38,988
Please I beg you

1178
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:44,856
"Please I beg you"

1179
01:43:47,121 --> 01:43:48,498
Drama

1180
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:53,034
Hello... Hovv are you Ved buddy?

1181
01:43:53,094 --> 01:43:53,936
Fine...

1182
01:43:53,995 --> 01:43:57,306
So wonderful to see you.
You're fine...? Hmm...?

1183
01:43:57,365 --> 01:43:59,140
Are you 0k? All good?

1184
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,111
Actually, no, I'm not fine

1185
01:44:01,368 --> 01:44:05,145
In a bad way. I've been fired

1186
01:44:05,339 --> 01:44:09,287
Security threw me out.
So I sit at home all day

1187
01:44:09,344 --> 01:44:13,224
I wake up at nights, anxious,
in a sweat

1188
01:44:13,281 --> 01:44:15,761
I had my appendix operated

1189
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:18,085
It's been leaking ever since

1190
01:44:18,152 --> 01:44:23,101
And fungus is growing
inside my body

1191
01:44:23,157 --> 01:44:28,038
The scrotum? In Hindi it's...?
- I don't know

1192
01:44:28,329 --> 01:44:32,072
Algae in my scrotum

1193
01:44:33,134 --> 01:44:36,411
I know it doesn't happen,
it's all psychological

1194
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:39,940
What are you doing?
- He asked

1195
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:41,179
Four times

1196
01:44:41,242 --> 01:44:43,745
Everyone says:
"Hovv are you?"

1197
01:44:45,046 --> 01:44:46,957
Why? They don't want to know

1198
01:44:47,148 --> 01:44:48,320
Very funny

1199
01:44:49,917 --> 01:44:52,261
I'll tell you

1200
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:55,801
I swear I tell you today

1201
01:44:55,857 --> 01:44:57,427
Let me go...

1202
01:44:59,227 --> 01:45:01,503
He's mad...
He assaulted me...

1203
01:45:03,164 --> 01:45:06,236
He is dangerous... He can't
be walking around like this...

1204
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:38,876
You are someone else

1205
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:44,809
You know it

1206
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:52,084
The world...

1207
01:45:53,714 --> 01:45:57,491
...sees only a mask

1208
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:03,902
You are someone else

1209
01:46:04,726 --> 01:46:08,003
Be who you truly are

1210
01:46:09,297 --> 01:46:14,297
Why aren't you what you really are

1211
01:46:24,312 --> 01:46:34,199
Don't forget your true self
for the sake of the world

1212
01:46:36,023 --> 01:46:45,876
Do not torment yourself

1213
01:46:46,801 --> 01:46:56,745
Remove the shackles you have tied

1214
01:46:57,144 --> 01:47:06,497
Tell the world you are another

1215
01:47:08,356 --> 01:47:09,494
Tara!

1216
01:47:17,798 --> 01:47:19,038
Which star?

1217
01:47:20,334 --> 01:47:21,836
Heading where?

1218
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:27,249
Where does my heart lead me?

1219
01:47:27,842 --> 01:47:29,185
Without my walking

1220
01:47:31,912 --> 01:47:36,793
The princess of my dreams
stands far away

1221
01:47:37,017 --> 01:47:39,861
Unreal. A mirage

1222
01:47:41,021 --> 01:47:43,831
Looks like water but is sand

1223
01:47:44,325 --> 01:47:46,134
Why make the effort?

1224
01:47:47,027 --> 01:47:49,405
She's worthless. Why bother?

1225
01:47:49,997 --> 01:47:52,375
Sacrifice everything for nothing?

1226
01:47:53,334 --> 01:47:58,306
Who wants gold and pearls
of the heart? Who cares...

1227
01:47:59,073 --> 01:48:00,347
....what's inside

1228
01:48:01,309 --> 01:48:04,722
Looks like water but is sand

1229
01:48:08,215 --> 01:48:13,130
Speak to him calmly
- Of course I will

1230
01:48:13,353 --> 01:48:14,423
What do you mean?

1231
01:48:16,957 --> 01:48:18,459
Come...

1232
01:48:20,428 --> 01:48:21,736
Come, son

1233
01:48:23,064 --> 01:48:24,737
Hovv long will you stay?

1234
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:26,970
A day or two

1235
01:48:27,868 --> 01:48:30,246
That's all? Only for a clay or tvvo?

1236
01:48:30,771 --> 01:48:31,977
Can't you e><tend your leave?

1237
01:48:38,145 --> 01:48:39,215
What's wrong?

1238
01:48:40,814 --> 01:48:41,849
Nothing

1239
01:48:44,051 --> 01:48:47,157
I am not working
- You quit yourjob?

1240
01:48:47,455 --> 01:48:48,957
Working elsewhere?

1241
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:55,333
Hovv long has it been?

1242
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:58,136
It's been...

1243
01:48:59,834 --> 01:49:00,972
A few days

1244
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:04,175
Two days, a month?
- Si>< months

1245
01:49:05,072 --> 01:49:06,881
Papa, don't worry

1246
01:49:07,108 --> 01:49:10,487
Si>< months
Doing what for si>< months?

1247
01:49:11,212 --> 01:49:13,852
What's wrong with you, Ved?

1248
01:49:13,915 --> 01:49:16,862
Ma, don't make a scene
- She's making a scene?

1249
01:49:17,351 --> 01:49:19,888
Idle for si>< months

1250
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:23,400
Look at your face! You look like
a drug addict

1251
01:49:23,457 --> 01:49:24,959
l'll leave today

1252
01:49:27,294 --> 01:49:28,432
I'll go back, Papa

1253
01:49:28,863 --> 01:49:31,810
You'll repeat the same things

1254
01:49:31,866 --> 01:49:34,938
Remind me of my duty.
When will I be responsible?

1255
01:49:35,002 --> 01:49:36,481
Think it pleases me?

1256
01:49:36,971 --> 01:49:39,281
Repeating the same things
over and over

1257
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:44,685
You're on the wrong path.
I have to drag you back

1258
01:49:45,813 --> 01:49:48,453
OK, Papa. I'll pack my bags

1259
01:49:49,183 --> 01:49:51,424
Am I your enemy?

1260
01:49:51,685 --> 01:49:53,221
No need for that

1261
01:49:53,821 --> 01:49:56,927
I'm my own enemy.
Ruining myself

1262
01:49:56,991 --> 01:49:58,766
That's true

1263
01:49:59,259 --> 01:50:01,034
Now you've said it

1264
01:50:01,696 --> 01:50:04,870
People without problems,
create problems

1265
01:50:05,232 --> 01:50:07,337
Never faced bad times

1266
01:50:08,769 --> 01:50:09,747
Cool...

1267
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:11,005
Super...

1268
01:50:11,739 --> 01:50:13,343
I'll pack my stuff

1269
01:50:26,787 --> 01:50:29,996
Done? What now?

1270
01:50:32,026 --> 01:50:34,973
I am going beyond the mountains

1271
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:39,902
Today I'll find out if the gypsies
found water

1272
01:50:40,935 --> 01:50:44,041
Get out of the world of stories,
you idiot

1273
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:51,418
Think of yourself. What will
become of your life?

1274
01:50:51,945 --> 01:50:56,223
Who knows? Only the storyteller
knows what will happen

1275
01:50:56,283 --> 01:50:57,887
He'll tell me

1276
01:51:15,102 --> 01:51:17,946
An old man used to sit here years ago

1277
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,277
Tell me a story

1278
01:51:50,838 --> 01:51:52,249
A story

1279
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:56,383
I have money. Loads of it

1280
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:09,258
The girl says to the boy:
"You're not whom I thought you were

1281
01:52:09,857 --> 01:52:14,328
"
 thought you were free, but
you're stuck." She goes

1282
01:52:14,995 --> 01:52:17,999
The boy is shaken.
He starts behaving oddly

1283
01:52:18,265 --> 01:52:23,180
He's fired. He's all alone.
What happens ne><t?

1284
01:52:24,137 --> 01:52:26,845
He's bound to his fate

1285
01:52:33,113 --> 01:52:39,553
The boy leaves the city for the
forest, lives among the beasts

1286
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:44,030
He talks to the trees, laughs loudly

1287
01:52:44,391 --> 01:52:49,067
Seeks Laila in all things.
In every speck

1288
01:52:49,129 --> 01:52:52,406
This is not lvlajnu's story.
It's Ved's story

1289
01:52:52,499 --> 01:52:53,773
Who?

1290
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:55,944
Ved. Me

1291
01:52:56,837 --> 01:52:59,408
This boy lives in the city.
Not the forest

1292
01:53:01,275 --> 01:53:06,782
He finds everything disagreeable

1293
01:53:07,114 --> 01:53:07,990
Correct

1294
01:53:08,382 --> 01:53:12,990
People around him
are suspicious of him

1295
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:17,429
They get mad at him.
Call him useless and crazy

1296
01:53:17,925 --> 01:53:20,030
He calls them crazy.

1297
01:53:20,261 --> 01:53:23,071
They are nasty to him

1298
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:26,409
He cries out: "It's my right."

1299
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:27,274
Stop!

1300
01:53:27,334 --> 01:53:30,941
They bury him alive between
two walls

1301
01:53:31,005 --> 01:53:33,884
The Emperor says:
"Take the vvretch away

1302
01:53:33,941 --> 01:53:36,512
"Throw him off the highest tower

1303
01:53:36,777 --> 01:53:39,257
"So Heer shan't see him again"
- Listen!

1304
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:40,986
Heer cries loudly

1305
01:53:41,048 --> 01:53:43,460
Where is my Lord Ram?

1306
01:53:43,717 --> 01:53:47,995
Ravaan, standing among
the crowd of devotees...

1307
01:53:48,055 --> 01:53:49,830
What are you blabbering?

1308
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:51,460
I asked something

1309
01:53:51,725 --> 01:53:53,033
What are you asking?

1310
01:53:53,093 --> 01:53:55,733
About my story

1311
01:53:55,796 --> 01:53:58,367
Who are you?
Why are you here?

1312
01:53:58,432 --> 01:54:00,139
What happens in my story?

1313
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,976
You're a thief. Throw him out

1314
01:54:03,837 --> 01:54:04,781
Calm down, Baba

1315
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:08,479
What happens ne><t?
- What did you come to steal?

1316
01:54:09,043 --> 01:54:12,115
We have no diamonds or
cures or God

1317
01:54:12,346 --> 01:54:13,825
Calm down, Baba

1318
01:54:13,847 --> 01:54:15,827
He's senile
- What happens next?

1319
01:54:16,083 --> 01:54:22,864
You're scared.
You ask me for your story. Coward!

1320
01:54:24,859 --> 01:54:28,102
Who do you fear? Who is here?

1321
01:54:30,331 --> 01:54:32,368
You tell me what happens ne><t

1322
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:35,176
Tell your story

1323
01:54:36,036 --> 01:54:38,778
What's in your heart?

1324
01:54:39,340 --> 01:54:41,149
What do you want?

1325
01:54:45,379 --> 01:54:47,188
What do I want?

1326
01:54:51,418 --> 01:54:56,128
Heer is in your heart but you
seek her in the wilderness

1327
01:54:57,824 --> 01:55:01,294
lmposter. Cheat!

1328
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:05,476
Get out!

1329
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:08,937
I said get out

1330
01:55:09,102 --> 01:55:10,945
Call the police

1331
01:55:11,305 --> 01:55:13,751
He's an imposter, a thief

1332
01:55:13,807 --> 01:55:15,081
He's gone.
- Call the police.

1333
01:55:40,401 --> 01:55:46,443
The story of this journey

1334
01:55:47,107 --> 01:55:54,389
Replete with questions

1335
01:55:55,215 --> 01:55:57,991
It starts with you

It ends with you

1337
01:56:03,190 --> 01:56:07,502
The story of this journey

1338
01:56:11,264 --> 01:56:16,264
The one I sought...

1339
01:56:24,411 --> 01:56:30,089

was deep within me

A step taken towards you.
Soon we shall meet

1342
01:57:06,453 --> 01:57:07,488
l—li

1343
01:57:08,355 --> 01:57:09,333
Hello

1344
01:57:09,723 --> 01:57:10,963
What happened?

1345
01:57:11,025 --> 01:57:12,129
Nothing

1346
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:14,202
You said you were leaving

1347
01:57:14,428 --> 01:57:17,136
I didn't. This is my father's house

1348
01:57:22,035 --> 01:57:24,379
Papa, can I tell you a story?

1349
01:57:27,074 --> 01:57:29,350
Yes, go ahead

1350
01:57:44,424 --> 01:57:48,873
Many years ago when India
was Partitioned

1351
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:52,208
There was a man who lived
in Lahore

1352
01:57:52,866 --> 01:57:54,937
His name was the Hero

1353
01:57:57,104 --> 01:57:59,209
The fire of Partition
spread ferociously

1354
01:57:59,273 --> 01:58:02,482
The Hero had to bring
his family to India

1355
01:58:05,045 --> 01:58:07,423
He left his riches behind

1356
01:58:07,815 --> 01:58:10,386
In one night,
our hero became a zero

1357
01:58:11,451 --> 01:58:15,797
Sorry, mistake. He didn't become
a zero, he's the hero

1358
01:58:16,389 --> 01:58:18,130
He worked in a wood mill

1359
01:58:18,191 --> 01:58:19,932
He worked hard.

1360
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:23,505
Started his own business,
built a beautiful house

1361
01:58:24,331 --> 01:58:27,335
Ne><t came his son,
the new hero

1362
01:58:28,969 --> 01:58:32,109
Worked hard too,
grew the business

1363
01:58:32,172 --> 01:58:35,483
He got a job. Educated
his children well

1364
01:58:35,742 --> 01:58:37,983
Added rooms to the old house

1365
01:58:39,012 --> 01:58:40,855
And then came his son

1366
01:58:41,348 --> 01:58:42,918
Now this is our hero

1367
01:58:44,051 --> 01:58:48,761
He tried management,
engineering, office work

1368
01:58:48,822 --> 01:58:52,964
Say yes, look down,
happy and sad

1369
01:58:57,130 --> 01:59:02,842
One day many miles away,
between the heart and world

1370
01:59:03,436 --> 01:59:05,006
Our hero found a companion

1371
01:59:12,078 --> 01:59:13,785
Who said: "HP.

1372
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:15,855
Our hero said: "Hello"

1373
01:59:16,049 --> 01:59:18,791
The companion asked:
Hovv are you?

1374
01:59:19,019 --> 01:59:22,125
Our hero said: Fine, thank you.
Hovv are you?

1375
01:59:22,389 --> 01:59:25,734
The companion asked:
Why are you talking like this?

1376
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,194
How?

1377
01:59:27,995 --> 01:59:30,236
You sound like a machine

1378
01:59:30,931 --> 01:59:32,137
Meaning?

1379
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:35,872
Wait. Where are you going?

1380
01:59:36,069 --> 01:59:38,845
I cannot stop. If I stop, I will die

1381
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:41,010
Die?

1382
01:59:41,742 --> 01:59:43,847
lam running a race

1383
01:59:45,812 --> 01:59:49,021
What race do you run?
- I don't know

1384
01:59:49,916 --> 01:59:52,795
You don't know,
so why are you running?

1385
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:57,191
Everyone is running.
So that's why I am running

1386
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:03,140
Why is everyone running?
Does no one stop to ask?

1387
02:00:03,363 --> 02:00:05,934
What? Why?

1388
02:00:06,232 --> 02:00:07,734
"What's that?"

1389
02:00:08,034 --> 02:00:09,172
What's that?

1390
02:00:09,469 --> 02:00:12,211
Vvhy?

1391
02:00:12,972 --> 02:00:14,042
Our very own "Why?"

1392
02:00:14,107 --> 02:00:15,711
You don't know why

1393
02:00:15,975 --> 02:00:18,216
You seem to have
dialed the wrong number,

1394
02:00:19,379 --> 02:00:20,858
Forget it

1395
02:00:21,181 --> 02:00:22,990
What difference which race

1396
02:00:23,249 --> 02:00:24,455
As long as you're winning

1397
02:00:24,851 --> 02:00:27,297
I'm sure you always win

1398
02:00:28,322 --> 02:00:29,300
Come second?

1399
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:30,800
l\lo

1400
02:00:31,158 --> 02:00:33,195
Third?
- No

1401
02:00:33,893 --> 02:00:37,136
Fourth, fifth, sixth,
seventh, eighth?

1402
02:00:37,197 --> 02:00:38,107
Ninth?

1403
02:00:38,164 --> 02:00:40,371
‘You seemed to have
dialed the wrong number.‘

1404
02:00:40,433 --> 02:00:45,314
Train no. 721...
Stop. Forget password.

1405
02:00:45,972 --> 02:00:47,747
Insurance is a subject
matter of solicitation.

1406
02:00:47,808 --> 02:00:49,879
Please read the offer document
carefully before investing.

1407
02:00:53,780 --> 02:00:56,260
You're somewhere in the middle

1408
02:00:57,150 --> 02:00:58,424
The middle-man

1409
02:00:59,152 --> 02:01:03,760
Yes, I'm mediocre

1410
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:07,170
You're so proud to be mediocre

1411
02:01:10,197 --> 02:01:12,837
Can I say something?

1412
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:16,247
I don't think you're ordinary

1413
02:01:17,337 --> 02:01:20,147
When I'm with you I feel special

1414
02:01:20,206 --> 02:01:21,879
Imagine hovv special you are

1415
02:01:22,409 --> 02:01:25,720
I've never met anyone like you

1416
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:30,225
Don't you think you're special?

1417
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:32,823
Sorry, wrong number.

1418
02:01:33,053 --> 02:01:36,159
What? Did no one tell you?

1419
02:01:37,090 --> 02:01:39,297
That reminds the hero of something

1420
02:01:39,759 --> 02:01:40,794
He says:

1421
02:01:41,094 --> 02:01:45,201
"There was someone
who said I was special"

1422
02:01:45,932 --> 02:01:48,105
That's right
Who was it?

1423
02:01:48,168 --> 02:01:51,377
He was a snake
- A snake?

1424
02:01:51,438 --> 02:01:54,783
Yes! He talked rot

1425
02:01:54,841 --> 02:01:58,288
You're full of wonder!
A mine of diamonds

1426
02:01:59,813 --> 02:02:00,883
Damn imposter

1427
02:02:01,248 --> 02:02:03,228
Know his name?

1428
02:02:03,817 --> 02:02:05,922
His name was...

1429
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:07,457
Childhood

1430
02:02:09,155 --> 02:02:10,156
My childhood

1431
02:02:10,223 --> 02:02:13,136
Childhood? Meaning, brother?

1432
02:02:13,193 --> 02:02:14,433
Are you mad?

1433
02:02:14,494 --> 02:02:17,168
Childhood was a poisonous snake

1434
02:02:17,230 --> 02:02:19,767
Slithering in the garden

1435
02:02:19,832 --> 02:02:21,072
Hiding behind bushes

1436
02:02:21,134 --> 02:02:24,343
Hood raised, ready to strike

1437
02:02:25,171 --> 02:02:27,378
Destroyed him when I grew up

1438
02:02:28,342 --> 02:02:29,946
Crushed him underfoot

1439
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:35,323
I put my foot on his damn neck
and pressed hard

1440
02:02:36,149 --> 02:02:38,151
Destroyed

1441
02:02:41,888 --> 02:02:46,098
Now it's ok. Now no one says
I am special

1442
02:02:46,493 --> 02:02:49,133
I can live my life comfortably now

1443
02:02:49,429 --> 02:02:53,343
Walk, stop, smile please, mediocre...

1444
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:56,371
Nonsense! A mistake

1445
02:02:57,070 --> 02:03:00,415
Choose your race. See if you
come first or not

1446
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:02,148
You'll come first

1447
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:04,882
Guaranteed. Stop!
- I cannot stop

1448
02:03:05,178 --> 02:03:06,885
Look at yourself

1449
02:03:07,414 --> 02:03:08,950
Know who you are

1450
02:03:09,149 --> 02:03:12,460
One day the world will know you.
Open your eyes

1451
02:03:12,886 --> 02:03:15,093
I won't open my eyes, I won't stop

1452
02:03:15,155 --> 02:03:17,829
l'll keep running the race.
l'll keep running

1453
02:03:17,891 --> 02:03:19,063
I'll stay mediocre

1454
02:03:19,126 --> 02:03:22,767
Average. Work, stop, smile please.

1455
02:03:25,331 --> 02:03:29,438
So our hero ran the race for
the rest of his life

1456
02:03:30,103 --> 02:03:31,514
And one day he died

1457
02:03:33,139 --> 02:03:34,311
Story over

1458
02:03:34,508 --> 02:03:37,011
Vvhy?
- What's "why?"

1459
02:03:41,414 --> 02:03:42,893
So hovv was the story?

1460
02:03:46,219 --> 02:03:47,323
Papa?

1461
02:03:52,125 --> 02:03:53,399
The end's bad?

1462
02:03:57,363 --> 02:03:58,740
Bad ending

1463
02:04:01,234 --> 02:04:05,205
It's my story. We'll change the end

1464
02:04:08,942 --> 02:04:12,788
This is who I am, papa.
This is who I am.

1465
02:04:14,347 --> 02:04:17,385
I am no good at Maths. I'm sorry

1466
02:04:20,887 --> 02:04:25,996
The last hero is the best.
My favourite

1467
02:04:34,134 --> 02:04:37,877
I'll come first in this race. I know

1468
02:04:37,937 --> 02:04:39,507
I know you vvill, son

1469
02:04:39,773 --> 02:04:42,777
Will you keep hugging each other?

1470
02:04:45,979 --> 02:04:47,720
What happens next?

1471
02:04:53,887 --> 02:04:56,299
No one has ever given me
such a big gift

1472
02:04:56,923 --> 02:04:59,460
I was so happy

1473
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:02,001
But what will I do with it?

1474
02:05:02,195 --> 02:05:05,938
The ring will fulfill
all your heart's desires

1475
02:05:06,232 --> 02:05:07,142
You'll see

1476
02:05:25,385 --> 02:05:29,231
When souls unite,
hovv long can bodies stay apart?

1477
02:05:30,056 --> 02:05:35,005
Ranjha, wander in forest or mountain.
Befriend the wilderness

1478
02:05:35,362 --> 02:05:39,310
You'll find your path.
Your feet will start moving

1479
02:05:39,332 --> 02:05:43,474
And one day Ranjha will reach
Heer's abode

1480
02:06:06,793 --> 02:06:09,399
Looking forward,
to the second part of your speech.

1481
02:06:09,462 --> 02:06:10,065
Thank you.

1482
02:06:10,129 --> 02:06:13,941
The discussion on the bipolar behavior
of the metropolitan consumer..

1483
02:07:31,177 --> 02:07:33,817
Stay cool, be normal.

1484
02:07:34,781 --> 02:07:38,194
They're watching us.
Keep walking

1485
02:07:42,822 --> 02:07:45,234
So you got the diamond consignment?

1486
02:07:49,161 --> 02:07:50,196
Oh, by the way.

1487
02:07:50,963 --> 02:07:55,036
Don 2!

1488
02:07:55,936 --> 02:07:59,281
The police from 12 countries
are looking for me...

1489
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:04,847
...and I am at a corporate's,
settling an old score

1490
02:08:06,746 --> 02:08:07,781
And you?

1491
02:08:09,349 --> 02:08:12,091
Me
-Yes, you

1492
02:08:12,785 --> 02:08:14,059
You must be someone

1493
02:08:15,788 --> 02:08:17,290
Me?

1494
02:08:19,192 --> 02:08:20,728
Mata Hari

1495
02:08:21,327 --> 02:08:24,137
Must have heard the name

1496
02:08:25,131 --> 02:08:29,876
So should I call you Mata...or Hari?

1497
02:08:31,003 --> 02:08:36,146
Don't call me anything,
just listen

1498
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:40,889
Indeed. I have much to hear

1499
02:08:41,047 --> 02:08:44,028
Hovv are you? Where were you?

1500
02:08:44,083 --> 02:08:48,725
Actually, I was in China, training

1501
02:08:49,289 --> 02:08:54,932
What training?
- Chinese torture training

1502
02:08:56,229 --> 02:08:59,733
In exchange for the diamond,
I'll teach you

1503
02:08:59,766 --> 02:09:03,077
Hovv exciting!
- No need for that

1504
02:09:03,102 --> 02:09:08,848
There's need.
I know unique ways of torturing

1505
02:09:10,076 --> 02:09:14,149
I have changed, Tara
- You'll change again

1506
02:09:14,180 --> 02:09:17,252
No, I was born as Don,
got corrupted later

1507
02:09:17,450 --> 02:09:19,191
Let me start at the beginning

1508
02:09:22,288 --> 02:09:27,288
The masks you're wearing
are not yours

1509
02:09:34,167 --> 02:09:40,118
Step forward,
tell us what lies in your heart

1510
02:09:40,239 --> 02:09:46,155
Step forward,
tell us what lies in your heart

1511
02:09:46,345 --> 02:09:56,198
The path of your dreams...

1512
02:09:57,123 --> 02:10:06,771
...wi

 lead you where you must go

1513
02:10:07,333 --> 02:10:12,282
Embrace those dreams

1514
02:10:13,172 --> 02:10:17,712
Tell us who you really are

1515
02:10:18,978 --> 02:10:27,329
Untie those shackles

1516
02:10:47,239 --> 02:10:54,088
You're someone else

1517
02:10:56,315 --> 02:11:00,957
You without boundary

1518
02:11:01,888 --> 02:11:07,895
Sky without limit

1519
02:11:09,195 --> 02:11:13,701
Be who you wish to be

1520
02:11:15,735 --> 02:11:18,909
You're the waves

1521
02:11:20,206 --> 02:11:23,278
You're the grandeur

1522
02:11:44,964 --> 02:11:46,409
Ladies and Gentlemen

1523
02:11:46,999 --> 02:11:48,171
Present...

1524
02:11:48,401 --> 02:11:50,039
The story teller...

1525
02:11:50,436 --> 02:11:52,473
Ved Vardhan Sahani.

1526
02:15:13,439 --> 02:15:15,214
I am convinced now

1527
02:15:17,009 --> 02:15:18,181
What?

1528
02:15:19,411 --> 02:15:21,789
You do have Teja's gold

1529
02:15:24,150 --> 02:15:25,390
For sure

1530
02:15:25,918 --> 02:15:26,862
So...

1531
02:16:24,110 --> 02:16:27,990
And then I thought,
dry up what's soaked

1532
02:16:28,848 --> 02:16:32,455
Be it female or male

1533
02:16:32,918 --> 02:16:33,521
Take the bait

1534
02:16:33,786 --> 02:16:35,959
She played a new ruse

1535
02:16:36,322 --> 02:16:38,393
And tricked me again

1536
02:16:38,457 --> 02:16:40,994
Trapped me for no reason

1537
02:16:41,193 --> 02:16:43,036
Curse you, O life

1538
02:17:16,929 --> 02:17:20,934
Listen, O beloved

1539
02:17:22,134 --> 02:17:25,877
My heart betrayed me

1540
02:17:25,938 --> 02:17:30,444
When I set eyes on you

1541
02:17:30,509 --> 02:17:35,481
I lost all senses

1542
02:17:35,881 --> 02:17:40,261
My weeping heart whispered

1543
02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:44,859
My eyes now speak for me

1544
02:17:45,090 --> 02:17:49,061
I see a new dream every day

1545
02:17:50,462 --> 02:17:55,138
My restless heart cries out

1546
02:17:55,200 --> 02:18:00,081
Don't hide behind that veil

1547
02:18:00,139 --> 02:18:04,019
A devoted lover...

1548
02:18:04,076 --> 02:18:08,821
...can only talk of love

1549
02:18:08,881 --> 02:18:11,418
The heart may lament

1550
02:18:11,483 --> 02:18:12,723
So...
