00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,700
Is anyone here?

2
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,060
It's very quiet

3
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,259
It's too quiet
I can't bear it

4
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,660
Who is in the next street?

5
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,100
Can you hear me?

6
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,220

My name is Kumar

'Kokki' Kumar

10
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,660
What does 'kokki' mean?

11
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,180
Who knows?

12
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,340
Kokki Kumar was happy
studying in a Govt school

13
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,380
- See you, ma
- Take care, son

14
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,060
Hey, Kumar

15
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,420
Why are you hitting me?

16
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,340
You are dancing here
without going to school

17
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,940
Why are you hitting
such a big boy?

18
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,260
Just like his father

19
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,340
Don't hit me like this
Then I'll run away somewhere

20
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,180
Go, get lost!

21
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,580
I'll go to the school
You go home

22
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,460
If you don't go to school,
don't come back home

23
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,100
- Listen to your mother
- Mind your own business

24
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,059

Kick your heels

77
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,540
Yes, I am having an affair
What will you do?

78
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,060
Wretched man!
Will you prosper?

79
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,059
You lay a finger on me
I'll slice you into two

80
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,580
Ma, I'm going for a movie

81
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,340
Take care

82
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,580
Will there be a lot
of fight scenes?

83
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,580
What, pa?

84
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,980
Has mother slept?

85
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,220
Why did you call me so late?

86
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:26,460
I slept early
Oh my god!

87
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,379
You killed her

88
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,500
I thought this would
happen one day

89
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,420
I didn't do it intentionally

90
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,620
She came after me
with a rolling pin

91
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,300
What to do?

92
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,460
Your wife is rough too

93
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,500
What, Selvam?

94
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,500
Your son is crying
Bring him along with you

95
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,340
Shekar, why is he crying non-stop?

96
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,580
Not a good sign

97
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,460
He was mother's pet

98
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,779
Tomorrow he will promptly
tell everyone you killed his mother

99
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,100
As it is there are enough people
waiting to see us go down the drain

100
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,460
- What do you want me to do?
- I'm not giving you ideas

101
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,059
But you think properly

102
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,580
You already have
another family in Korattur

103
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,700
Now do you get it?

104
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,139
This is only for
your own welfare

105
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,899
Understand
Don't leave the boy out

106
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,180
Okay?

107
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,580
- What do you want, Kumar?
- Water

108
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,659
Hey Kumar...wait

Anna, can you
give me some food?

120
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,420
I'll pay you tomorrow morning

121
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,740
Omelet

122
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,260
Serve me an omelet

Throat operation

124
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,300
Give me some money

Police

126
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,420
What?

127
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,340
Do you who I am?

128
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,939
If Anbu comes to
know about this-

129
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,060
Don't make a fuss

130
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,100
- Don't make me hit you
- Try touching me

131
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,100
Brother, call Anbu

132
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,340
Hey, come

133
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,299
If my shirt tears-

134
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,740
Come out
I'll teach you a lesson

135
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,380
Take your hand off me

136
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,860
This chap also

137
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,700
Take them in

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,380
Take your hands off me
I'll come

139
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,700
Hey, go man

140
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,299
Sir, I didn't do anything

141
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,940
Your face gives it away

142
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,500
Sir, I'm just a beggar here

143
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,820
I don't know them at all
I'll fall at your feet

144
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,820
This is the limit

145
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,340
I don't want to hit you

146
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,019
Get in

147
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,540
Get in

148
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,740
Who is he?

149
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,779
Throat operation fellow

150
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,660
He is a beggar

151
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,539
Don't

152
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:01,980
Aiyo!

153
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:04,139
Sir, don't hit me

154
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,380
I didn't do anything
I was only begging, sir

155
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,540
He is too tall
Send him back

156
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,340
Smile

157
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,700
Not you

158
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,980
Try to look sad

159
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,420
'20 drug peddlers arrested
Police on a rampage'

160
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,500
My hands were tied, Anbu

161
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,460
DIG gave strict orders
to beat them up

162
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,540
But I made sure
they were fed well

163
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,660
Yes, bro, he bought us
'biryani' thrice

164
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,460
Shut up, hog of a mongrel!

165
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,860
Shanmugam, are only my boys selling?

166
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,740
What about Murthy's boys?

167
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,740
Get your palms alone
greased well from both of us

168
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,660
Anbu, a retired judge in
that area complained

169
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,500
Murthy thinks no end of himself
because he is favored by the Govt

170
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,980
Tell him it will be
our turn one day

171
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,900
Murthy is a royal pain
in our areas, boss

172
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,660
Who is this chap?

173
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,620
Bro, when the police arrested us
he was also brought in by mistake

174
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,340
The Inspector beat him up
black and blue

175
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,860
Big joke!

176
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,020
You could have told him

177
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,419
Do they even listen to us?
Only their 'lathi' speaks

178
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,860
But all 3 meals
they fed us 'biryani'

179
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,540
Useless fellow

180
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,579
Who are you, boy?

181
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,820
'Throat operation' fellow

182
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,780
He is a beggar

183
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,340
Stop ridiculing him

184
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,099
Clear out

185
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,780
Don't come here

186
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,700
Out

187
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,220
Please give me a job

188
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,860
I feel ashamed to beg

189
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,619
Haven't had a decent meal
for the past 2 days

190
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,100
I'll do any kind of work

191
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,579
- Are you educated?
- 12th grade

192
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,700
What do you say, Mani?

193
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,740
His story is true
He is a beggar, I know

194
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,859
Okay, let me think about it

195
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,420
Apply ointment here

196
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,220
Inspector's wife will
come to our market-

197
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,180
Who the hell is that?

198
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,620
What is all this?

199
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,140
Bless me, brother

200
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,619
"Coming?"

201
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,740
"Homecoming?"

202
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,620
"Booming?"

203
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,339
"Blooming?"

204
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,340
If we come into power, I vow
we will uproot all these atrocities-

205
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,460
"Oh...Yeah..."

206
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,260
"Rooming?"

207
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,260
"Mushrooming?"

208
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,100
"Grooming?"

209
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,020
"Homecoming?"

210
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,859
"Booming?"

211
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,020
"Blooming?"

212
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,140
"Girl who brings the water
It tastes more like liquor!"

213
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,780
"The water-bearer lassie"

214
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,100
"Will you come away with me?"

215
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,380
"Shall we go away separately?"

216
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,700
"Lay it thick!"

217
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,460
"Take her quick"

218
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,820
"Coming?"

219
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,379
"Homecoming?"

220
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,460
"Booming?"

221
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,420
"Blooming?"

222
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,300
"Upcoming?"

223
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,420
"Forthcoming?"

224
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,579
"Welcoming!"

225
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,740
Go easy

226
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,540
First you had a fix

227
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,700
Now booze

228
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,020
Wonder what will happen?

229
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,899
He will just get the runs

230
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,020
He seems to have collapsed

231
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,540
Weak body

232
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,700
I feel like laughing at him

233
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,300
I feel like laughing at him

234
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,060
But I'm crying inside

235
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,980
I feel like crying out loud

236
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,300
Mani anna, would you mind if I cried?

237
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,540
Promise me you won't laugh

238
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,380
He is in high spirits

239
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,180
Who know what his problems are?

240
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,580
Turn on the taps

241
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,100
But why do you want to want to cry?

242
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,380
My mother died

243
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,620
How?

244
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,740
My father cut my mother's throat

245
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,980
Such a small throat
Half of it was missing

246
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,780
She was lying down
like this and staring at me

247
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,580
I just couldn't see her lifeless

248
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,220
Blood every where

249
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,859
It was my fault

250
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,660
If I had not gone to watch a film
I would have saved my mother

251
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,579
Mani anna
give me a sickle

252
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,660
Like my father used

253
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,460
I'll kill him with 1 blow

254
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,540
He is laughing at me

255
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,380
I know why you are laughing at me

256
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,220
Taking a dig at me, wondering
how on earth he will kill?

257
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,060
Anna, ask him
not to laugh at me

258
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,700
I feel awful

259
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,300
Just shut up, will you?

260
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,140
Don't spoil for a fight

261
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,460
Sit down

262
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,980
Listen to me

263
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,540
He is too tanked to know
what he is saying!

264
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,099
Kumar, you love your mother?

265
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,860
Who won't?

266
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,180
Even cats and dogs do

267
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,780
My mother will beat me
black and blue

268
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,220
But I won't feel the pain

269
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,140
When I open my eyes
wondering why...

270
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,100
...she will be hitting
the floor and bench

271
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,740
Not a single blow on me

272
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,300
But still I'll act
as if I am hurt

273
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,500
By mistake if I do get hit
her eyes will start watering

274
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,700
My precious son,
will I ever beat you up?

275
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,460
You should go to
school everyday

276
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,260
Study properly and become
a bank official or a Govt officer

277
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,220
She will falling at my feet
literally pleading, Mani

278
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,899
I'll get goose bumps

279
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,700
You want me to go
to school, that's all, right?

280
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,619
I'll take my bag and leave

281
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,260
If only my mother was alive,
I won't be begging

282
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,700
Not land up here

283
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,460
I might have even become a doctor

284
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,820
Why are you provoking him?

285
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,740
As if he is the only one
with a mother!

286
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,260
Were we born with drugs
smeared head to toe?

287
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,460
Even I had a mother

288
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,180
I asked her 1 question

289
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,140
When my father has gone out
why do you make out with the tailor?

290
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,500
She poured hot water
straight from the stove all over me

291
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,820
I was totally scalded

292
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,260
I was in the hospital for 2 months

293
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,220
Today she is coming
and asking me for money

294
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,540
I said, 'Get lost, you itch
with a B in front!'

295
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,620
Everyone here
has a story, Kumar

296
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,180
Ask Jeeva his story
It is truly funny

297
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,740
Is my life a joke to you?

298
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,139
Your story is interesting

299
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,339
Go ahead, share it

300
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,700
Let Kumar hear it

301
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,780
Why do you hassle me like this?

302
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,140
My father was a lorry driver

303
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,500
He went somewhere, got AIDS
gave it to my mother and conked off

304
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,500
'She suffered a lot'

305
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,420
'My sister and I took care of her
by doing some menial jobs'

306
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,340
'One day, she committed suicide
by self immolation'

307
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,260
'Praise be to Lord Ganesha'

308
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,619
Thank you

309
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,300
Don't you want me to do
anything for you this time too?

310
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,380
If you are scared
let me know

311
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,260
I can-

312
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,139
No

313
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,660
Why?

314
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,180
You work your butt out every month

315
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,060
Why do you give it to me?

316
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,380
Can I leave?

317
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,780
Do you have some other
job to attend to?

318
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,619
Did you enquire properly?

319
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,980
Why are you tense, bro?

320
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,940
They are all busy
with their own stuff

321
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,060
No one is around now

322
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,500
This is confirmed news

323
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,579
Why does our boss conduct
meetings in only Murthy bro's area?

324
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,980
Sticking these posters
is a painful job

325
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,740
We should show our power
only in their area

326
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,940
When they see our poster
in morning, they will die

327
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,540
Is that Murthy?

328
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,380
Yes, bro

329
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,020
Anna...anna

330
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,260
I asked if you had
enquired properly

331
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,460
What can I do?
His program must have changed

332
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,780
'Murthy M.L.A., Ruling party'

333
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,300
Only 5 of them

334
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,340
We can always
finish them off

335
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,980
If Murthy is somewhere
in this area...

336
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,940
...there are at least
100 thugs around him

337
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,339
He can kill 10 men
single-handed for sure

338
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,220
And if he's watching us
paste posters in his area now-

339
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,540
Hey! Stop it

340
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,700
What to do now?

341
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,339
Start the car

342
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,900
Run over anyone
who blocks our way

343
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,540
Boys, run as fast as you can

344
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,700
Hold on

345
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,020
Run to the left

346
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,740
Grab them

347
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,700
Look at this useless henchman

348
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,900
Drive slowly

349
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,060
Turn and wait

350
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,500
Don't stop

351
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,740
They are sticking
posters in our area, bro

352
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,220
Some of them escaped in their car

353
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,099
Our boys have gone
in search of the rest

354
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,220
We got hold of
only this chap

355
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,060
Who is that?

356
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,940
Looks like a pencil

357
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,980
He is one of the underdogs

358
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,980
We didn't get any of the biggies

359
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,099
Kill and throw his body in the market

360
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,459
Let them know the repercussions
of sticking posters in our area

361
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,260
Did you take your medicine?

362
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,740
Coughing all the time

363
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,580
And your dream is
to become a hero!

364
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,339
For the sin of being your brother
I'm forced to produce a film for you!

365
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:25,660
Wait and watch
what a roaring success I'll be

366
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,859
Remove your damn coolers and go

367
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,300
Oh yes! And you'll dye your hair

368
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,340
They are playing
a cat and mouse game

369
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,019
They will take their own
sweet time to kill him

370
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,700
As if their memory is short
to what we did to their goon

371
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,260
Delhi, Anbu here

372
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,340
We came here to stick
posters in Murthy's area

373
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,780
We are in a soup

374
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,019
Can you send some boys here?

375
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,580
More than 100 goons here

376
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,180
Shall I let go?

377
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,780
That seems right too

378
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,940
Okay

379
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,420
Let's go

380
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,740
Come on

381
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,300
Bro, Kumar

382
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,940
That's all
It's his fate

383
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,340
Let us at least see
what they do to him, bro

384
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,460
You think we should?
That seems right too

385
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,980
As if we won't get hold
of his boys someday

386
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:43,180
- Enough, huh?
- No, bro

387
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,740
Don't you remember the way
they murdered our Krishna?

388
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,140
Don't keep comparing

389
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,180
I'm panting
Finish him off

390
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,780
Hit him elsewhere

391
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,580
Why are you dilly dallying?

392
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,020
Isn't it getting late?

393
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,380
Bro, almost over

394
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,420
Let go of him

395
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,580
He is on his feet

396
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,180
Not bad, bro

397
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,700
He is still able to move

398
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,060
Move aside

399
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,140
It's getting late

400
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,020
Bro will lose his patience

401
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,220
Come on, I say

402
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,539
Hit me

403
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,100
Hit me if you consider yourself a man

404
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,060
You want to hit me?

405
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,940
Go on

406
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,340
Bash me up

407
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,660
How long can you hit?

408
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,100
I don't feel the pain

409
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,780
Not even an ounce of pain

410
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,420
Hit me, you sissies

411
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,420
I am burning inside

412
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,579
I'll kill all of you

413
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,140
I can't believe this

414
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,860
I swear, Delhi
I saw him

415
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,059
Just a punch

416
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,540
Like this

417
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,700
The sound still rings
in my ears

418
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,300
His ribs are broken it seems

419
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
Only him

420
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,340
Singlehanded

421
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,619
Like a lion

422
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,180
100 men around him

423
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,740
Murthy was also there

424
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,740
You know Murthy's track record

425
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,860
We are the talk of the town

426
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,220
They are searching
for us with a frenzy

427
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,580
The thug who died
is quite topnotch

428
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,380
It will take a while for
things to cool down

429
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,260
He is safe
only at your place

430
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,260
Why don't you sit
at the table and eat?

431
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,980
He's still in a frenzy

432
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,820
Kumar

433
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,460
Your friends are here to visit you

434
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,740
Let's go, sister

435
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,020
Sister...?

436
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,100
You carry on
I'll be with you

437
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,380
Cigarette

438
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,980
No, forget it

439
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,620
Not in the mood

440
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,140
Don't interrupt
when he is talking

441
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,180
If you keep talking-

442
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,620
What is the final conclusion?

443
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,100
You know all of us
inside out, bro

444
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,260
If you bring in novices
who have killed only once...

445
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,700
...it will be a major hassle
We have a respect to maintain

446
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,900
Send him on an assignment
We will see how he performs

447
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,820
Don't be scared of this test

448
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,579
We should know your ability

449
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,059
Never lock your bike
on the side

450
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,820
You can't getaway
in an emergency

451
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,140
Come, we need to walk
a little distance from here

452
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,020
You isn't a big job

453
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,940
Just chop a man's hand

454
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,540
Right hand
Note it down

455
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,300
Okay anna

456
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,100
Come

457
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,380
That's the house

458
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,540
He will come to
this house at 10:00 p.m

459
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,420
And leave by 1:00 a.m

460
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,940
She is his mistress

461
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,380
Look, that's his car

462
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,060
He has to walk this
distance to get into his car

463
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,180
That's why we are
standing here

464
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,340
Understood?

465
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,700
Look if he is inside

466
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,140
If you look for so long...

467
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,540
...kaput

468
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,860
You should peep a little bit
and then pull away

469
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,780
All you'll get is 1 second

470
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,740
Note down everything
within that span

471
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,059
Is that clear?

472
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,380
Now look

473
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,099
What did you see?

474
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,780
There is no one there

475
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,420
What else did you see?

476
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,420
Why do you stress me out?

477
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,140
There is man walking on the street

478
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,260
A female is looking out
from her balcony

479
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,340
2-3 kids are playing
hide and seek

480
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,780
2 dogs are roaming around

481
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,660
3 houses have their doors open

482
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,060
Take a look

483
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,179
I was right?

484
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,420
Eye should capture
everything like a camera

485
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,260
Not miss a single detail

486
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,740
Here, take this
Your weapon

487
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,700
Keep it safe at home
invoking God's blessings!

488
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,260
Hold it

489
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,420
Your hands are shivering

490
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,540
Hold it steady

491
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,700
Keep it like this

492
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,740
It shouldn't be seen
And easy to handle

493
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,220
Take it out

494
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,620
Shove it in

495
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,940
Do it once more

496
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,060
Shove it in

497
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,180
Not bad

498
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,820
Only 5 minutes left
He will be here any time

499
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,900
Be alert

500
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,780
Keep your hands
on your hip

501
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,820
Are you scared?

502
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,100
No

503
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,060
Don't lie
Aren't you scared?

504
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,979
Even I'm scared

505
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,459
It isn't wrong

506
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,460
Fear will protect you

507
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,820
Only when we fear our life
we can take another life

508
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,380
He is coming

509
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,820
Don't even breathe

510
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,780
Keep your hand
on the knife

511
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,700
Go

512
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,579
Go, man

513
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,060
Go, I say

514
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,940
You would have
got me killed too

515
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,580
I am stuck with you

516
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,780
Get up

517
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,059
It's okay

518
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,940
This is how it will be
the first time

519
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,980
Don't get tense

520
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,180
I've chopped half

521
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,820
You chop the rest

522
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,780
Only then you will understand

523
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,780
GO

524
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,860
Let's go

525
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,539
Don't worry

526
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,180
I'll certify you well

527
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,380
"To one side of the mouth, fire flickers"

528
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,499
"In both eyes however, a knife glitters"

529
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:18,459
"The stride of a man is a give-away
The whole town will at once give way"

530
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:26,780
"What is this, oh God?
I have no clue, my lord!"

531
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:32,979
"Uprooted trees surround
Jungle razed to the ground"

532
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:14,380
"Spying neighbor
Road-side informer"

533
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:20,380
"At the market stares daggers
Dying to kill me, follows orders"

534
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,659
Whatever happens
never express your fear

535
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:28,580
"He follows me like a puppy
Like Lord Yama, he tails me"

536
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:34,220
"Many faces, different sides
When our eyes meet, he hides"

537
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,740
This is your problem, Kumar

538
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,380
You killed Murthy's brother

539
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,380
So they are after you

540
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,580
If we come in between
then it will become a gang war

541
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:47,140
"Will he make the 1st move?
Or will I attack to prove?"

542
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,700
"If tomorrow night, dude"

543
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,500
"...he comes, I'll tell you"

544
00:51:53,540 --> 00:52:00,380
"Clouds burst and break into rain indeed
A ball when kicked quickens its speed"

545
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,220
"What is this, oh God-"

546
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,540
Hey, no

547
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,740
Stay like that

548
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,420
He's twirling his weapon so fast!

549
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,620
Chop his head

550
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,180
Chop his head

551
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,740
Aim for his head

552
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,900
Come on I say

553
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,260
Saroja, is Krishnaveni there?

554
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,980
She has gone with
a customer to Mahabalipuram

555
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,300
She will be back tomorrow

556
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,900
Is it urgent?

557
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,660
Can I send someone else?

558
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,540
No need

559
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,820
I'll give you her number

560
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,019
Want to talk to her?

561
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,260
Call for you

562
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,300
Why are you giving
this number?

563
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,540
Wherever we go
we should give the number

564
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,260
Bloody fool!

565
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,900
Did he beat you?

566
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,820
Did he hit you?

567
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,820
No

568
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,500
What's the matter?

569
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,100
I want to see you

570
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,100
I'll come tomorrow morning

571
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,459
Okay, see you

572
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,780
I'll call you later

573
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,420
Don't imagine the worst
and get tense

574
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,499
I'll see you tomorrow

575
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,700
Bro, for my sake

576
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,539
That brothel survives
thanks to her

577
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,940
Krishnaveni is the main attraction

578
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,380
How can she be spared?

579
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,060
Poor thing, bro
She is not interested

580
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,220
As if we do our job
with great interest

581
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,780
It's our profession

582
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,060
Kumar, you are unaware of
behind the scene activities

583
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,260
We have rules to follow

584
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,900
I won't ask whom
you intend killing

585
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,060
They same way don't
ask me to spare this girl

586
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,580
You shouldn't even be
asking me in the first place

587
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,620
I was the one who
took you there

588
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,740
Don't talk without knowing
the history behind it

589
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,019
Why this deviation?

590
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,860
You are doing
well for yourself

591
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,019
Everyone is raving about you

592
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,860
Why trespass into unwanted space?

593
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,900
If you want take her out for 2 days

594
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,060
Be happy

595
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:26,860
Instead you are trying
to reform people!

596
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,820
No, bro

597
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,540
Poor girl

598
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,380
Leave her

599
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,940
Are you threatening me?

600
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,140
You are not talking

601
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,380
Your desire for her is talking

602
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,539
Because you enjoyed
what she offered you

603
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,140
You are blinded

604
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,060
What did she say?

605
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,019
Did she say you are a big shot
and we will be frightened of you?

606
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,780
Your are a toddler!

607
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,340
How much I would have seen?

608
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:05,020
Just because I know you
I'm trying to be patient

609
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,140
Go

610
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,460
I've been there
Felt all this

611
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,100
- Bro?
- Then what?

612
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,460
Does he really know me?

613
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,180
From tomorrow
she won't come to work

614
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,740
Put it back

615
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,540
You don't need that
to kill him

616
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,340
Take him away

617
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,500
Thinks he is royalty
to order us around

618
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,580
Do a good job
of polishing it

619
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,420
Not the same place

620
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,580
Why are you glaring at me?

621
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,420
I'm telling you and
you are still glaring at me

622
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,460
Bro, listen to me

623
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,140
Don't get tense

624
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,620
He is a novice

625
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,220
Let him go

626
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,140
Go and don't act stupid

627
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,420
If our boss hears about this
it will become an issue

628
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,100
Let's go, anna

629
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,180
What the hell?

630
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,140
Are you sending
a messenger?

631
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,860
Looks like both brother and sister
have forgotten your past

632
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,220
I'll chop you

633
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,140
You don't need me anymore?

634
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,540
Are you fed up with it?

635
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,979
That bloody mongrel
is defending you to me

636
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,500
You lured him, huh?

637
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,660
Is he the knight
in shining armor?

638
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,300
You should be like this
for a week now

639
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:15,459
Saroja, lock her up and
starve her till I tell you

640
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,220
Did she ask you
to defend her?

641
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,539
She was leading her own life

642
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,420
He will kill her

643
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:41,300
He has ordered
his goons to kill you too

644
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,140
They are looking for you

645
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,420
Go hide somewhere for a week

646
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,260
We will try and plead
for your life

647
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,499
If you stay here
he will kill you

648
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,460
Clear out

649
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,940
You should know your place

650
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,820
Not think you are
Lord of all you survey!

651
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,580
Can't get into the bad
books of Anbu, Kumar

652
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,300
The message will reach our boss

653
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,740
Find some other place to stay

654
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,300
How is the gravy?

655
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,740
Your mother prepared it

656
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,820
I searched for you everywhere

657
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,900
You ran away that day
though I kept calling you

658
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,980
My boys came and told me

659
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,540
You had joined Delhi's gang
and become quite notorious

660
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,220
I just couldn't believe it

661
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,340
I was so happy

662
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,940
I threw a party for the boys
and tipped them 1000 bucks each

663
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,660
Why do you feel shy?

664
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:43,740
He is your brother
Come and serve

665
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,540
Look at her feeling shy

666
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,979
Don't worry, Kumar

667
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,140
You can stay here for
as long as you want

668
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,940
We aren't as big as you

669
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,620
Still no one can sneak into
our area without my knowledge

670
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,140
How much do they pay you?

671
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,020
Tell me only if you want to

672
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,300
Around 30 to 40000

673
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,540
God exists, Kumar

674
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,700
You were worried
we were suffering

675
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,660
My son has come back to save us

676
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,980
For the past 6months,
no proper income

677
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,100
I'm living on
borrowed money

678
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,940
I'm not even sending them to school

679
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:30,380
I didn't have an option
but to picked pocket yesterday

680
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,139
I was totally disgraced, Kumar

681
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,340
What?

682
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,300
Keep it in, Kumar

683
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,139
Why are you suddenly
taking out your money?

684
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,340
Now we are all one family

685
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:47,100
Just felt like sharing it
with my son, I did so

686
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,499
Do something

687
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,580
'A few days later'

688
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,300
Behave properly, Kumar

689
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,700
I've told Anbu bro everything

690
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,300
He is in a good mood today

691
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,020
Don't get me wrong

692
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,900
How could you rub
our boss the wrong way?

693
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,220
Don't be scared
We are here with you

694
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,499
The girl looked up to me
like I was her hero

695
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,540
In that temerity
I lost my cool

696
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,059
Forgive this dog, bro

697
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,420
Ask your thugs not to kill me

698
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:29,220
You are everything to me, bro

699
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,459
Bro, don't, please

700
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,100
Ask these boys

701
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,420
I'll praise you sky high
daily to them

702
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,620
He is such a fast learner

703
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:55,780
He will reach greater heights
within 5 to 6 years

704
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,300
How dare you talk
to me like that?

705
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,940
What did you lack?

706
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,860
I looked after you
like my son, didn't I?

707
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,860
Bro...!

708
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,740
Why fall at me feet
after being so audacious?

709
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,180
Decision once made
can't be changed

710
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,380
Get up

711
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,619
Don't kill me

712
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,980
Think yourself to be a rowdy?

713
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,860
How much did they pay you?

714
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,179
Who sent you?

715
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,780
Did you come here to kill Anbu?

716
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,300
Sir, don't

717
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:01,940
Don't get tense

718
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:03,180
Anbu is dead

719
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,380
Can't you see?

720
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,180
Who will look
after that locality?

721
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,780
At the beginning of every month
he will give me 10 million bucks

722
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,820
He will place it at my feet
and get my blessing

723
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,420
He worked like
a dog for 30 years

724
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,700
Why did you bring him here?

725
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,340
Why didn't you dissect him
and throw him into the Cooum?

726
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:21,940
Son of a mongrel

727
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,740
I spoke to him
2 nights ago

728
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,900
Told him the elections are nearing

729
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,979
He asked me not to worry and
promised to arrange for 50 million

730
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,900
Such an unfair untimely death

731
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:36,420
What to do with him?

732
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,380
Erect a statue in the beach

733
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,260
Okay?
Go

734
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,620
Get lost!

735
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:48,380
He has set a bad example
Others will follow

736
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,740
Will it turn out well?

737
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:52,940
Hey Delhi

738
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,700
If we spare him,
will he be of any use to us?

739
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:59,979
If you spare my life,
then I'll let you go

740
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,660
Are you acting over-smart?

741
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,700
Can't you see our men around?

742
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:13,180
If you create a scene
I'll show you my prowess

743
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,060
Then what is the use
of your boys chasing me?

744
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,340
What?

745
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,380
Did you have this knife hidden
and let me beat you?

746
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:23,059
What if you had
killed me in anger?

747
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,500
I was almost tempted

748
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,380
But you might be of
some use in the future

749
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:31,220
Hey, what's your age now?

750
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,660
Hey Ram
Times have changed

751
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:39,420
They are growing up so fast

752
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,460
What do you know about Anbu?

753
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,620
He was in politics
for the past 30 years

754
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,099
Do you know there is
a big gang behind him?

755
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,420
Do you think they will leave you?

756
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,300
Can you survive 1 night?

757
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:58,620
If you are alive till dawn
you are brave indeed

758
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,220
Anbu's area will be
under your control

759
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,700
- Take it, go
- Boss?

760
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:04,340
Hey, I know Anbu's men
better than any of you

761
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,180
Hey Ramu

762
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,020
E.M.M follower Kumar is dead
Give this as news to be printed

763
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,020
Your parents will take
the room downstairs

764
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:52,380
Our room is upstairs

765
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,019
Mani and Jeeva will stay
in the next room

766
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,380
For security

767
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,900
I need some money

768
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,740
There is no provision
in the house

769
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,180
Can we postpone this for tonight?

770
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:12,019
Not angry with me?

771
01:08:18,059 --> 01:08:19,419
1 minute

772
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,900
Go

773
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:56,620
Here, I can only give this

774
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,220
That too not for you

775
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,620
For the sake of my leader

776
01:09:01,139 --> 01:09:03,419
Don't know what is happening

777
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:08,380
A greenhorn is seated with
crossed legs and dictating terms

778
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:10,260
You are silently watching

779
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,900
He will tell us it seems

780
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,979
How much we should
supply in each area

781
01:09:14,059 --> 01:09:15,660
And we should obey I believe

782
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:20,259
I can't be treated like crap

783
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:22,220
What will he do
if I don't give?

784
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,300
What will you do?
I'm asking you directly

785
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,540
Will you finish me off?

786
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,380
You're going overboard

787
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,340
Oh my God!

788
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,780
Don't make this worse

789
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,259
Take him away

790
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,860
I might kill him in anger

791
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:37,379
Father, you wait out

792
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,460
I'll handle this

793
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,460
Kumar, you are a novice

794
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,580
Listen to me

795
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:51,060
If necessary call us
We are waiting out

796
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:52,620
Disgusting!

797
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,940
Your area collection
is 2 million

798
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,700
I should get 8 lakhs

799
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,380
Next month, I need 15 lakhs

800
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,300
Increase the price of
drug and alcohol

801
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:04,580
We have to pay our leader

802
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,980
Can you hear me?
This applies to everyone

803
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:09,700
I just now said
I cannot give

804
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:10,820
But you-

805
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,419
I'll solve your problem later

806
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,100
I'm talking to them

807
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,740
Listen! You need not
pay any money today

808
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,780
We will discuss and
come to a conclusion

809
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,980
Go now, I will
meet you tomorrow

810
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,380
I'm trying to be polite

811
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:31,340
You're behaving like
a heavy weight, huh?

812
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,260
Do we look like
pipsqueaks to you?

813
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:40,499
Inform our boss
to change this dog

814
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,300
Otherwise he will not get
even 10 paise from any area

815
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:48,420
Bloody pigs playing with marbles in
the street trying to order me around

816
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:51,900
He was given this posting
because he killed 4 thugs it seems

817
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,540
We have been at this for years
shedding blood and sweat

818
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:59,219
I'll be here tomorrow morning

819
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,780
I shouldn't see you
anywhere in this city

820
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,460
If I see you...then-

821
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:11,020
Come to my area tomorrow

822
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,579
Hereafter I call the shots
Understood?

823
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,020
You are doing well for yourself

824
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,379
All the best!

825
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,300
Your man Sethu spoke to me

826
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,580
You wanted me to
forget my brother's death

827
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,740
And become friends I heard

828
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,259
That isn't possible

829
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,500
1 minute

830
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,140
Sethu wants to talk to you

831
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,259
Don't send these sissies anymore

832
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,820
3 more days
You will be dead

833
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,620
Only after your die...

834
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:51,100
...my brother's wife has vowed
to don the widow's attire

835
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,579
Why are you making
a mockery of this?

836
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:56,540
I'll send you
Sethu's body

837
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,700
Okay?

838
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:58,860
Bye, dear

839
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,180
We are leaving now

840
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,940
I thought we can stay together

841
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:11,620
But looks like we will
have scant respect

842
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,260
My son is doing well
I'll admire him from far

843
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,860
Mani, bring it here

844
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,900
Selvam anna, take this

845
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:31,700
What is this?

846
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:34,100
Share this 2 million
amongst yourself

847
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:38,660
I'll look after my father

848
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,660
You leave

849
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,020
You need not work anywhere

850
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,100
Live peacefully

851
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,219
Take this

852
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,660
You are indeed blessed, Shekar

853
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:57,340
Your only son is
helping the entire city

854
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,220
See you

855
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,260
Don't sulk, father

856
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,900
There should be only
1 spokesperson

857
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,900
You love me a lot

858
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,500
What if you act rashly?

859
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,100
So I asked you to stay out

860
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,700
But you have a point

861
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:21,980
Don't stay with me

862
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,259
They will pin you down
and kill me

863
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:27,100
Besides this is our den
for all our activities

864
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:29,379
Not good to have
sister in her teens around

865
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,020
We have 3-4 houses

866
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,020
Take a look

867
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:34,100
Choose whichever house you want

868
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,580
Each house is worth 1 billion

869
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,579
It's not about money, Kumar

870
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,259
I prefer to stay with you

871
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,500
We are anyway close by

872
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:44,380
I'll visit you on Sundays

873
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,339
Relax, father

874
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,140
Why do you want to suffer?

875
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:50,420
Veni

876
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,260
When you need money
let me know

877
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,860
I'll send it over

878
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,100
They are going
to the new house

879
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:02,259
Take them shopping and
buy whatever they want

880
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:03,740
Now?

881
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:06,540
What will they do
with an empty house?

882
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,540
Go

883
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:09,660
Let's go

884
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,940
Make a list of things you want

885
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,900
Mani, take my father and
show him Anbu's houses

886
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:22,060
Give him the keys
to the house he selects

887
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,980
Set right all the items
he will need to live comfortably

888
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:26,940
Okay

889
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,700
Go, father

890
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,339
I'll call you in the evening

891
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,579
Hurry up

892
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,700
How long will you
take to get down?

893
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,980
Mani, I don't like this house

894
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,379
Too congested

895
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,860
Should I stay all my life
in a street house?

896
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:05,740
How about the Neelangarai house?

897
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,259
Come in

898
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,980
They seem to have
started the party?

899
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,259
Hey Jeeva

900
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,540
How come you are here?

901
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,540
Kumar anna, wanted to
know if everything is fine

902
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,260
Come...don't feel shy

903
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:22,020
This one?

904
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,780
Go

905
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:26,820
See you

906
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,700
What is this?

907
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,180
This is the house

908
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,700
Here, huh?

909
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,340
We have to walk a little

910
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,820
Street is too small for a car

911
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:49,900
A house in this place?

912
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,340
Take a look

913
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,700
With a garden and grove

914
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,380
You will definitely like it

915
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:01,740
Nothing

916
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:12,379
What?

917
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,940
Get into this pit

918
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,460
Will you shut up or not?

919
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,299
Who is it?

920
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,260
Damn!

921
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,660
They won't even let me
to relax for a while

922
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,460
What?

923
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,380
Bro-

924
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:33,980
Who are you?

925
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:36,780
Did Kumar send you?

926
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:49,220
Is this your way of showing
you don't want me in your gang?

927
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,500
You know what will happen
if Kumar gets to know?

928
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,060
I'll go and-

929
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,459
Let go of me

930
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,500
If my son comes to know
he will chop you to pieces

931
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:00,460
Let me go

932
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,100
Kumar, Mani here

933
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,980
Father wants to talk to you

934
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,300
Here

935
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,700
Kumar, they have dug a pit for me

936
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,740
Mani is forcing me
to lie in there

937
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,820
- Do you know all this?
- Give the phone to Mani

938
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,620
Tell him

939
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,540
He is acting smart

940
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,299
I got scared

941
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,700
I thought you were
avenging your mother's death

942
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,780
I'll talk to him

943
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:32,020
Hey, my son wants to talk to you

944
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,580
Okay, we will be there

945
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:46,020
We have another
assignment at 10

946
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,419
He is asking us to come early

947
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:49,660
Quick, lie down

948
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:50,980
It's getting late

949
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,900
Can I talk to you
for 5 minutes?

950
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,379
- Take it
- No need

951
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,700
Kumar will be looking for us

952
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:11,900
We must leave now

953
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,540
Give Kumar my regards

954
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:23,980
Don't

955
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,299
Tell him to spare me

956
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,140
I'll go somewhere else

957
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,660
I'm too old to harm him

958
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,620
Please ask him to
forgive me once

959
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:35,060
I didn't kill his mother on purpose

960
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,219
Mani, what will happen
to my wife and daughter?

961
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:00,020
I'll fall at your feet
Please don't kill me

962
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,539
If you make a fuss
I'll beat you to death

963
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,820
Just obey implicitly

964
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,100
Mani, ask them to stop

965
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,820
Don't throw sand on me

966
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:31,940
Tell Kumar you have buried me

967
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:33,180
I'll escape somewhere

968
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:34,660
You don't know your son at all

969
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:37,460
He will come and dig
this pit in the morning

970
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,420
Please don't bury me alive

971
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:48,860
I won't spare you

972
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,580
Even I'm a big rowdy

973
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,980
I'll finish you off
like I did your mother

974
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,580
Everyone has paid up the money

975
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,020
No problem

976
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:42,420
Good morning
All is well

977
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,419
Good morning, sir

978
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,500
Boss is in a meeting
but you can go in

979
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,020
Good morning, boss

980
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:09,860
Duraiswami, wait out

981
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,100
How can I?

982
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,700
In front of the boss

983
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,460
Show him

984
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:31,100
You trusted me and
gave me that area

985
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,100
Whatever I could collect

986
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:32,860

God, bless us all

990
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:48,660
Give me the garland

991
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:51,820
Bless me, boss

992
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:53,700

We are being harassed
by the manager

998
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:15,380
He blatantly asks us
to sleep with him

999
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,380
If we don't comply,
he will fire us it seems

1000
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:18,540
Only you can intervene

1001
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,780
They have arrested my son

1002
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,860
We are starving

1003

are being sold to hotels

1016
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:07,900
Come, Kumar

1017
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:09,259
Let us go and talk inside

1018
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:17,020
What happened, boss?

1019
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:24,780
Thenmozhi

1020
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,780
Hello, madam
How are you?

1021
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,980
Go to bed, my dear

1022
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,180
Kumar is here
He will handle it

1023
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,500
Go and sleep peacefully

1024
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:43,460
Sir, what happened?
Why is your daughter crying?

1025
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,539
Thenmozhi is studying in a college

1026
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:48,500
She has a whole load of friends

1027
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,860
Both boys and girls

1028
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,700
She used to come home late
at night attending parties and disco

1029
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:58,020
I didn't bother because
this is the new generation

1030
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:01,020
2 days ago she went to
her friend's birthday party

1031
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:03,459
Somewhere in a guest house
near Mahabalipuram

1032
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:07,820
They all drank
Got tanked

1033
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:10,259
She fainted over there

1034
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:18,259
3 guys took her to a room and
raped her continuously, Kumar

1035
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:22,060
Sir, I understand

1036
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,140
No, Kumar

1037
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:24,619
I can even stomach this

1038
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:27,380
But they have shot a video

1039
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:34,980
Now they are asking me
to cough up 2 billion

1040
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:37,020
Otherwise they will
upload the video

1041
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,540
Money is not a problem for me

1042
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:42,180
What if they go back
on their word?

1043
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:45,260
Don't know
whom to ask a favor

1044
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,020
I know all the cops in Tamil Nadu

1045
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,339
Ministers in the ruling party
are all my friends

1046
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,780
But if I ask them...

1047
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:54,980
...then my daughter's life
will be spoilt

1048
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:58,219
How can I get her married?

1049
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,780
Hello, can you move?

1050
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,219
I have to take my car out

1051
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,940
Won't your parents be worried?

1052
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,540
Wandering around so late

1053
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,540
What?

1054
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:26,980
Hey! Don't mess with me

1055
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:34,220
Girls from Tamil Nadu!
Can you leave?

1056
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:35,980
I need to talk
to your friend in private

1057
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,180
Hey look

1058
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:40,700
Okay, you must have
lured her with drinks

1059
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,060
I understand

1060
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,740
Just 10 minutes

1061
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:47,780
Charmi, you go wait there
I'll come

1062
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:51,980
Come soon

1063
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:53,660
What?

1064
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:56,339
We are here
to get that video

1065
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:58,580
Don't get it?

1066
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:00,459
Thenmozhi's video

1067
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:02,420
You played with a girl
in the guest house

1068
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,020
Money?

1069
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,940
Show it to him

1070
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,820
Where is Thenmozhi?

1071
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:20,580
She will come

1072
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:22,580
You saw the money, right?

1073
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:24,060
Now give me the cassette

1074
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,060
Do I look like a fool to you?

1075
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,499
If I show you the cassette
won't you snatch it from me?

1076
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:29,980
Leave the money and go

1077
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,780
Cassette will reach you tomorrow

1078
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,260
Selvam

1079
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:44,459
You need some more practice

1080
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,900
He is shouting

1081
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,300
Put him in the trunk

1082
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,620
Where is the cassette?

1083
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:51,900
Do you know who my father is?

1084
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,259
I'll kill you, rascal

1085
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:00,620
This is better

1086
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:03,180
Put him in the trunk

1087
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,500
Where is the cassette?

1088
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:12,420
Not gone to bed as yet?

1089
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:15,980
If you give me a job
you can sleep in peace

1090
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,620
Just this
No other copy

1091
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:21,740
Your money

1092
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:26,260
Kumar, what would I have
done without you?

1093
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:32,100
Thenmozhi should pray
to your picture daily!

1094
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,940
Only now I am at peace

1095
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,620
Kumar, do girls from
such a high class drink?

1096
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,219
She was drunk

1097
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:45,260
These girls will
let the guys trespass

1098
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:49,379
Boys were also drunk
Sooper rich

1099
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:52,700
They showed their might
Who can be blamed in this?

1100
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:55,619
Will it work if you compete
with men in all areas?

1101
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:02,820
He gave us the cassette
Can we let him go?

1102
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:10,780
Won't the place where we buried
my father be deserted now?

1103
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:17,220
Raji, drive towards
East coast road

1104
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:22,860
Kumar, you keep burying like this
you'll create a small graveyard

1105
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,660
Yes, of course

1106
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:26,980
I've killed so many times

1107
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:29,420
But all that is so insignificant

1108
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,580
The 1st murder

1109
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:34,259
That is really a big deal

1110
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,500
You take a knife

1111
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:40,660
Pierce it into a body
And see blood splatter

1112
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:47,380
A rush of temerity
in every nerve

1113
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,060
2 horns grow
out of your head

1114
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:52,219
It happened to me

1115
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:55,940
After that, we can kill an army
We won't feel bad at all

1116
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:00,900
It's me

1117
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:03,140
Me...ME

1118
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:06,900
A kind of intoxication

1119
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,060
Poisonous high

1120
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:13,259
As it hits the head
we slide into our world

1121
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,100
What I think is right

1122
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,100
I am God

1123
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:18,940
Welcome, Kumar

1124
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:20,580
Leave me

1125
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:25,860
Welcome

1126
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:28,060
I was worried whether
you will come or not

1127
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:29,539
How are you, Veni?

1128
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:37,420
Hey, you have always
been very generous

1129
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:38,260
It's okay

1130
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:41,140
If you put it in this offering plate
the notes will get wet!

1131
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:44,060
Okay, come in

1132
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,220
This is my sister, Kumar

1133
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,860
She was all along in Madurai
So you would haven't seen her

1134
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:09,660
What's this bad habit?

1135
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:11,220
Fall at his feet and
take his blessings

1136
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:12,140
No need

1137
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,379
- Keep quiet
- No need

1138
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:14,380
Listen to me

1139
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:15,220
Keep quiet

1140
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:15,900
No need

1141
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:17,339
Get his blessings

1142
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:20,620
Without your help as if I could
have conducted such a grand wedding

1143
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:28,700
Enough...enough

1144
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,579
God bless you

1145
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,219
See you

1146
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,700
We'll take leave

1147
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:37,940
I have some errands to run

1148
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:38,820
Please eat

1149
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:41,500
I've arranged for a party tonight
at the beach, come without fail

1150
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:09,420
"Grass and flowers vocalize
Puzzled, fire tends to verbalize"

1151
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,740
"In ignorance lips publicize"

1152
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:14,820
"Blowing hot and cold
high spirits will hug and hold"

1153
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:19,700
"A girl's glance casts its net
Her look hits like a tempest"

1154
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,060
"Eyes ignite desire
with no barrier"

1155
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,940
"Her third eye kumkum
Hot glance kindles a welcome"

1156
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:39,900
"With a little passion
With a thirst for gratification"

1157
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:44,620
"This is life's essence
Why be cloaked in pretence?"

1158
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:59,700
"One side is hot and sultry
The other is cold and wintry"

1159
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:02,020
"I can see my previous birth, dearie"

1160
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,740
"Time twists and twirls me
in the 'circle of life' theory"

1161
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:39,500
"Reflection said 'welcome' warmly
Heart said 'stop, stop' warily"

1162
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:44,700
"An illusive image of you and me
Chase the ghost away religiously"

1163
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:49,500
"If you fall into the pit of intoxication
I swear there's no inhibition"

1164
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:54,540
"Rivers that roll into a hollow
cannot flow to hills above"

1165
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:59,460
"Even if it is God's decree
tigers won't live on any tree"

1166
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:04,460
"As per the season's dictum
leaves fall off branches in autumn"

1167
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:09,900
"With a little love in tow
Tad disappointed also"

1168
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:15,100
"This is life's experience
Why this disguise nonsense?"

1169
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,220
"I'll take you on a shopping spree
I'll get you whatever you fancy"

1170
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:29,460
"Come home with me, honey
Wherever I go, stick next to me"

1171
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:34,620
"I didn't see you yesterday
I didn't sleep a wink today"

1172
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:39,700
"What will happen in the morning?
Who will be the groom in the wedding?"

1173
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:44,860
"What does tomorrow hold for me?
Who will get married is destiny"

1174
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:49,700
"Will my senses awaken anew?
Will the moon become a square too?"

1175
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:54,780
"Will my high spirits affect my head?
Will the moon be a square instead?"

1176
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:57,060
"Once corrupt why seek enlightenment?"

1177
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,820
"Is righteousness in lust an endorsement?"

1178
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:37,980
I don't know how
to wear this damn thing

1179
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:42,500
Where have you
kept the flowers?

1180
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:43,580
In the room downstairs

1181
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:45,060
I've been looking
for it for so long

1182
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,579
Has Lakshmi akka reached?

1183
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:47,540
She came long ago

1184
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:48,860
Oh God!
The door is open

1185
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:49,740
Close it

1186
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,540
(Holy chants)

1187
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:25,740
It has fallen down
Keep it in the tray

1188
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:27,299
What kind of priest are you!

1189
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:52,020
Give the sacred thread
to the priest

1190
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,459
You should be
the one to give

1191
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,460
Listen to me

1192
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:56,460
The marriage will take place
only if you give

1193
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:57,580
I've informed everyone

1194
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:58,700
Give it with your blessing

1195
01:36:58,740 --> 01:36:59,700
No, you go

1196
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:02,100
- Don't play
- Give it

1197
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:03,700
What is all this?

1198
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:10,220
'Imagine feeling shy
for all this!'

1199
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,420
'What a disgrace!'

1200
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:48,540
Selvi, he has ruined your life

1201
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:51,860
Idiot! Why did you invite
this dog for the wedding?

1202
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:54,620
What?

1203
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,740
Is this a wedding
or a funeral?

1204
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:58,380
Why are you lamenting like this?

1205
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:02,100
Mani, why can't I marry your sister?

1206
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:04,900
In what way am I inferior
to the groom you chose?

1207
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,379
Who is he?

1208
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:11,620
After all that dog works for
pittance in some random office

1209
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:14,299
We begged him for a year
just for 1 sovereign of gold

1210
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:16,460
She will get new clothes
for only Diwali and Pongal

1211
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:20,260
Do you want her to suffer
in poverty all her life?

1212
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:21,940
I can't watch her suffer

1213
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:24,180
Don't you know about me?

1214
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:26,380
Don't you know how well
I'll look after your sister?

1215
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:27,500
You mother can cry

1216
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,620
Your father can cry
But can you cry?

1217
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:31,620
I'm sad

1218
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:32,980
I'm very sad

1219
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,619
You have known me for so long
And you are letting me down

1220
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,020
I'm ashamed

1221
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:39,020
To be honest,
what should you have done?

1222
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:40,379
You should have garlanded me

1223
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:44,740
Got me new clothes and
escorted me with respect

1224
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:46,499
What kind of a friend are you?

1225
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:50,379
Go and do whatever
you need to do

1226
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,380
Make arrangements
for our wedding night

1227
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:55,020
Sir, go get the flowers, fruits
and the necessary paraphernalia

1228
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,539
My dear lady
please go

1229
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:58,860
You will kill me
with your tears!

1230
01:38:58,940 --> 01:38:59,940
Please go

1231
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:03,700
Go, Mani

1232
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:05,540
Won't I feel like getting married?

1233
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:07,020
Understand my view point

1234
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:13,980
You're such a big shot and
you don't know to wear a 'dhoti'?

1235
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,580
I'm not used to all this

1236
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:17,300
This has nothing
to do with my job

1237
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:22,180
Use this belt and
it won't fall off your waist

1238
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:27,820
Spray this too

1239
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:30,539
She is an educated girl
She will expect all this

1240
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,220
Don't know what she expected

1241
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:37,460
She loved that guy so much

1242
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:40,180
Who on earth imagined
this kind of atrocity will happen

1243
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:44,020
What did you say?

1244
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:47,020
No, nothing

1245
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,820
You have decided to speak
your mind, you might as well finish

1246
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:55,220
That girl is a graduate

1247
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:57,100
She would've married
someone on her wavelength

1248
01:39:57,180 --> 01:39:58,180
And led a peaceful life

1249
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,260
I think you messed it up big time

1250
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:02,700
I know it was
wrong on my part

1251
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,940
I didn't do it purposely, Ravi anna

1252
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:09,060
Somehow I fell for her

1253
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:14,060
I'll tell you something
Everyone has a childhood dream

1254
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,499
About the kind of girl
he would want to marry

1255
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:19,020
But rarely does one get
the girl of his dreams

1256
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:23,100
If you happen to see
someone like that by chance...

1257
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:25,379
...and if you can make
your dream come true

1258
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:27,580
...will you take it or not?

1259
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:31,740
Instead of dying
yearning for her lifelong...

1260
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:33,900
...better to make a mistake
and regret for 5 minutes

1261
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:34,820
I'm human after all

1262
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:35,980
Not Gandhi

1263
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:39,620
In spite of wearing a belt
it refuses to stay on my waist

1264
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:31,580
I heard you plan
to kill my brother

1265
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:33,140
Is it true?

1266
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:38,180
I'll comply to
every wish of yours

1267
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,700
But leave my brother alone

1268
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:51,180
Were you very close to
the man my brother killed?

1269
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:57,100
How close is he to you?

1270
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:00,299
He is like my brother

1271
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,780
He taught me everything

1272
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:10,860
You claim he is
like your brother

1273
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:13,180
He died just a few minutes ago

1274
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:16,060
You're not even grieving for him?

1275
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:18,060
You are intent on
removing my jewelry

1276
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:41,379
What is her name?

1277
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:44,500
I have married her
without knowing her name

1278
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:52,940
What you said is true

1279
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:56,620
Ravi is close to me
Like my own brother

1280
01:42:57,340 --> 01:42:58,700
He is dead

1281
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:00,380
I'm not feeling sad at all

1282
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:04,020
I want to cry
But I am unable to

1283
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:05,020
Why?

1284
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,900
How will I know
what is in your heart?

1285
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:15,020
Can I tell you what I feel?

1286
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:18,260
Then you shouldn't feel bad

1287
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:22,820
I feel-

1288
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:26,740
I feel like sleeping with you

1289
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:29,820
If you don't agree...

1290
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:33,820
...I'm thinking of threatening you
by saying 'I'll kill your brother'

1291
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:35,900
Don't get me wrong

1292
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,700
Our first night together
Such a beautiful wife

1293
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,700
What else will I think?

1294
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:47,980
Should I switch off
the light or let it stay?

1295
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:50,539
I'm okay with both

1296
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:52,100
Your wish

1297
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,540
Don't agree thinking
I'm threatening you

1298
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:58,339
I told you what I felt

1299
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:01,020
I won't harm your brother

1300
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,259
Happy?

1301
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:24,539
Then...what's news?

1302
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:28,300
Who has come
so early in the morning?

1303
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:30,820
Tell them I can't
meet anyone today

1304
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,060
Office is closed today

1305
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:34,499
I've been invited for lunch
at my sister-in-law's place

1306
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:36,340
Mudaliyar asked me
to give this to you

1307
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:39,700
I thought he won't give me
but he has changed his mind

1308
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:42,300
Proves my new wife
is my lucky mascot

1309
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:45,380
Go and give this to Selvi

1310
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:48,060
Tell her I asked you
to give it to her

1311
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:49,020
Okay

1312
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:53,379
Are you married?

1313
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:58,259
Wretched fellow!
Get married soon

1314
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:00,500
It's sheer undiluted pleasure

1315
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:03,220
Yesterday was my wedding night

1316
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:06,340
She touched me

1317
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:09,219
Something melted inside

1318
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:11,980
Above all, the scent

1319
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:13,780
The scent of a woman

1320
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:16,259
Mixed with sandalwood
and vermilion...

1321
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:22,540
...I could not figure out whether
it was the scent of her body or tresses

1322
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,100
What a rush of adrenalin!

1323
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:27,180
She placed her head here

1324
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:34,060
I felt giddy and slept for hours

1325
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:37,180
When I woke up in the morning-

1326
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:39,900
What is that film in which
Saroja devi will sing a song?

1327
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:41,060
What is that song?

1328
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:46,940
"I heard the temple bell ring in my ears"

1329
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:48,339
She's a clone of Saroja Devi

1330
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:50,740
Hot coffee

1331
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:52,300
In the bed itself

1332
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:53,380
So clean

1333
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:56,420
Unlike the tea our boy brings
with his fingers dipped into it

1334
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:59,380
I wonder how I drank
that horrible stuff day in and day out

1335
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:01,339
Once I drank my coffee...

1336
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:05,980
...she requested me
to brush my teeth

1337
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:08,540
I went inside the bathroom
and undressed

1338
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:13,260
She followed me and I wondered
if she wanted a quickie in the morning

1339
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:15,380
She said she wanted
to scrub my back!

1340
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:18,180
She scrubbed my body
Shampooed and dried my hair

1341
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:20,180
It feels soft as silk

1342
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:23,220
First she used shampoo
and then conditioner

1343
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:25,660
She rinsed my hair thoroughly

1344
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,740
I feel clean head to toe

1345
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:34,900
What's wrong with all of you?

1346
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:38,140
I'm talking and none of you
seem to be happy for me

1347
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:40,940
What is the problem?

1348
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:43,420
I'm asking you

1349
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:44,780
Is there any problem?

1350
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:46,220
Mani-

1351
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:49,620
What happened to Mani?

1352
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:52,300
Mani joined Murthy's gang

1353
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:59,299
Bloody scumbag! Rogue

1354
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:01,540
Don't you have a better time
to give me bad news?

1355
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:04,260
I spend half a night
with my wife

1356
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:05,940
And then come back
in 'cloud 9' mode

1357
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:08,620
You pile up bad news
into my ears

1358
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:10,900
Why are you making
my life miserable?

1359
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:13,219
Why couldn't this news
have waited till tomorrow?

1360
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:14,740
You should tell me
everything now

1361
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:16,140
And I should take
a knife and run

1362
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:17,740
My shirt should be bloodstained

1363
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:20,780
There should be no fragrance of
sandalwood or turmeric on me

1364
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:22,940
I should smell like a butcher

1365
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:24,140
Isn't it so?

1366
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:27,100
Kumar

1367
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:29,100
Now what is your bad news?

1368
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:31,259
What next?

1369
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:32,380
Not that-

1370
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:33,380
Then

1371
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:35,419
Krishnaveni has come

1372
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:57,940
I'm going back
to my home town

1373
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:06,740
I thought you would marry me
one day and we will have babies

1374
01:48:07,540 --> 01:48:08,860
It's my fault

1375
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:11,339
Whatever said and done...

1376
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:14,140
...I am not a virgin

1377
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:17,259
I'm leaving

1378
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:19,820
I came to tell you
before I go

1379
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:21,700
Do you need money?

1380
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:25,860
What?

1381
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:32,380
You've given me a lot already

1382
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:34,100
Bye

1383
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:41,620
I didn't want to tell you this

1384
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,339
But I can't hide it from you

1385
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:49,660
I fainted last evening and
the doctor congratulated me

1386
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:53,140
He said I'm pregnant

1387
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:55,300
I was only able to laugh

1388
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:00,420
I haven't decided as yet
to go for an abortion or not

1389
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:03,220
If you were with me it's fine

1390
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:05,660
If not...

1391
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:10,580
...people will malign him
as a prostitute's son

1392
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:15,500
Don't know if my hometown
is equipped with abortions

1393
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:16,940
I'll manage

1394
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:19,780
What else to say?

1395
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:23,860
I only feel like crying

1396
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:28,540
I want to go alone and cry

1397
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:32,140
I anyway have to go
a 1000 kilometers alone

1398
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:33,980
I can do my crying in the bus

1399
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:45,140
'Hey! Look how happy Jeeva is'

1400
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:46,700
'He got his sister married'

1401
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:53,459
Would you have married me
if I was not pregnant?

1402
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:22,540
Selvi, I did not do it purposely

1403
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:24,140
Poor girl!

1404
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:31,060
If you keep sulking
won't I feel sad?

1405
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:36,740
Isn't one girl enough for a night?

1406
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:41,820
Take your tablets properly

1407
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:42,820
Okay

1408
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:44,340
Look at him

1409
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:46,940
My dear?

1410
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:48,860
What?

1411
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:52,780
Doctor, will my son look like this?

1412
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:12,100
What did the doctor say
at the hospital?

1413
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:15,860
Boy or girl?

1414
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,020
You have changed a lot

1415
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:25,020
It seems you are taking
very good care of her

1416
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:27,180
You take her to the hospital

1417
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,580
The old rowdy in you has vanished

1418
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:32,980
Are you so fond of babies?

1419
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:38,060
I am myself clueless, Selvi

1420
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:40,140
This seems to be
a new kind of joy

1421
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:43,379
There should be a purpose
in making money, right?

1422
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:46,620
I've been thinking a lot

1423
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:50,299
I became like this because
my father was not a decent man

1424
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:52,140
Then how should I bring up my son?

1425
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:55,620
He should be oblivious
to a place like this

1426
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:57,020
I'll send him abroad

1427
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:58,420
Think about it

1428
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:03,020
He will come back
and talk to me in English

1429
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:04,700
I won't understand a word

1430
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:07,060
I'll just say okay and listen

1431
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:15,460
Are you aware your boys
are gossiping behind your back?

1432
01:52:16,180 --> 01:52:17,100
What?

1433
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:20,380
Whether the baby is really yours!

1434
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:26,860
Why get angry?
Her profession is such

1435
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:30,339
As if you married a virgin

1436
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:34,580
Anyway if you are
convinced it is okay

1437
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:39,060
Nobody should laugh
behind your back tomorrow

1438
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:44,380
Who knows, maybe one of
your henchmen could be the father

1439
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:05,660
'Kokki Kumar arrested for 30 murders
Statement by his own assistant'

1440
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:11,420
There is no connection
between Kumar and my party

1441
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:16,620
I've never met him under any
circumstance nor any reason

1442
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:18,980
I can swear on
my mother tongue

1443
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:25,540
I'm convinced it is an attempt
to slander my party

1444
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:28,860
You took the bribe
Not fair

1445
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:42,540
I've even gone to
his house to check out

1446
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:44,260
They swear our boss is not in town

1447
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:47,020
They are making up stories
he is in Madurai and Dindugal

1448
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:50,900
They will make use
of us till their work is done

1449
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:52,900
Once their work is over
they will ditch us

1450
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:54,500
We can't believe them

1451
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:57,380
Poor thing!
Krishnaveni is also inside

1452
01:53:57,860 --> 01:54:00,339
She is pregnant
Wonder how she is

1453
01:54:00,820 --> 01:54:03,140
Only if you surrender
they will let Veni out

1454
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:24,180
How dare you attack Murthy anna

1455
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:27,180
I won't spare you

1456
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:36,100
What is that noise?

1457
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:38,220
Get inside

1458
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:40,219
Go

1459
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:56,020
The lawyer says
the case is very strong

1460
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:58,299
Why should I stay in
for his misdeeds?

1461
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:00,300
I don't know what you will do

1462
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:01,460
I have to come out soon

1463
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:03,820
'They will kill me if I stay
2 more days in here'

1464
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:22,660
Traitor!

1465
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,700
Mongrel! You betrayed
your own sister's husband

1466
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:38,620
Hey! Move aside

1467
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:40,100
Please sit

1468
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:04,660
What?

1469
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:09,379
What is your name?

1470
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:12,259
What is your name?

1471
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:18,860
If something happens to me
my wife will die, sir

1472
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:24,220
If you punish an innocent man
like me, my wife will self-immolate

1473
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:26,300
She loves me so much

1474
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:28,700
Why are you blabbering
without any relevance?

1475
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:31,380
To the concern person
it will be relevant

1476
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:33,460
'You cannot talk
like this in court'

1477
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:35,620
'Answer to the point'

1478
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:43,060
Mani, where are you going?

1479
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:44,459
Wait

1480
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,300
The judge is waiting for you

1481
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:47,620
Mani, listen to me

1482
01:56:47,660 --> 01:56:49,260
Judge will be annoyed

1483
01:57:53,420 --> 01:58:00,940
Kumar, they belong
to various parties

1484
01:58:07,660 --> 01:58:08,860
Don't you understand?

1485
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:10,580
Since Tamilselvan ditches us...

1486
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:12,900
...they want to know
if you will join their party

1487
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:16,580
They are ready
to give you a posting

1488
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:19,299
'Can't you hear us?'

1489
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:20,340
'Clear out'

1490
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:22,380
'Step out'

1491
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:26,580
Kumar, they are not
letting me come inside

1492
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:28,620
He hasn't received
the payment for this month

1493
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:30,340
Our leader wanted to know why

1494
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:35,060
Am I in town?

1495
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:38,300
No, you have gone to
Madurai or Dindugal

1496
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:39,900
Not in town it seems

1497
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:41,259
Come back later

1498
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:44,100
Don't make a blunder, Kumar

1499
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:46,980
This is not wrong

1500
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:49,860
So many days I worked
like a dog for you

1501
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:51,219
Only that is wrong

1502
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:54,540
Do I look like a foo-

1503
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:57,420
Only now I know about you

1504
01:58:57,860 --> 01:59:00,780
When I had a problem
all of you ran away

1505
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:02,500
Go

1506
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:04,060
Go and tell your leader

1507
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:05,619
We don't need his party

1508
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:07,100
We will stay alone

1509
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:09,539
Kumar, as your friend
I am cautioning yo-

1510
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:11,900
I'm hopping mad

1511
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:13,259
Just leave

1512
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:19,180
He kicks me now and then

1513
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:22,980
Nothing, don't worry

1514
01:59:23,020 --> 01:59:24,299
You sit
I'll see

1515
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:26,259
What is it, dear?

1516
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:28,820
Nothing

1517
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:30,740
What is happening?

1518
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:41,860
We have seen
all kinds of castes

1519
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:43,700
There is a black smudge
under my eye

1520
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:45,540
Hello, Kumar

1521
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:46,580
What a surprise!

1522
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:48,820
Have you finished visiting
Madurai and Dindugal?

1523
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:51,180
Don't taunt him!

1524
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:53,860
Why did you throw
a bomb into my house?

1525
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:57,259
Bomb, huh?
I don't know anything

1526
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:00,020
Why are you acting?

1527
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:01,700
Didn't you throw
a bomb last night?

1528
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:04,340
I swear on my mother
I don't know anything

1529
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:05,860
I don't know anything
Don't be evasive

1530
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:08,339
Either accept or refute it

1531
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:11,940
Someone who felt good for me
might have done it

1532
02:00:12,020 --> 02:00:13,540
I don't know anything else

1533
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:17,540
If anything happens
to me or my wife-

1534
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:19,780
They dropped the bomb
only in your house, right?

1535
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:21,219
Not on your head

1536
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:24,580
So you are the one
who did that

1537
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:26,340
I don't know, Kumar

1538
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:29,180
Suddenly you said
you won't give money

1539
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:32,740
Members from other parties are
coming to your office it seems

1540
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:36,219
May be one of our volunteers
must have got angry and done it

1541
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:37,860
Do you know
anything about this?

1542
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:40,500
- No idea
- We don't know

1543
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:43,100
For those who claim
they don't know anything

1544
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:45,100
And those who are sniggering
let me tell you this

1545
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:47,499
Whoever put the bomb
will be headless tomorrow

1546
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:50,780
Why are you over reacting, Kumar?

1547
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:52,940
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything

1548
02:00:52,980 --> 02:00:54,740
Just leave me in peace
That's enough

1549
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:57,420
Ramu, come here

1550
02:00:57,660 --> 02:01:00,780
Immediately make Kumar
secretary of Egmore region

1551
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:03,300
Sir, why select him for-

1552
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:04,940
I know what to do

1553
02:01:05,340 --> 02:01:07,700
Kumar, you won't
face any problem

1554
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:10,700
Even the ruling party members
will not harm you

1555
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:12,540
If you still have any problem...

1556
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:14,220
...our party will support you

1557
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,660
If they arrest you,
whole of Tamil Nadu will protest

1558
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:18,500
I assure you chaos
in every nook and corner

1559
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:19,420
Satisfied?

1560
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:25,500
I am the kind to elevate
and admire from far

1561
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:31,140
Fall at my feet, Kumar

1562
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:34,620
Go ahead

1563
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:37,980
'Leader of E.M.M party Tamilselvan
elects 'Kokki' Kumar as regional secretary'

1564
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:45,820
Kumar, this is the 1st step
in your ladder to reach the stars

1565
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:48,660
One fine day you might
even become a minister

1566
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:51,219
- It's getting late, sir
- Wait, I'll come

1567
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:54,060
Make arrangements
for the money

1568
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:57,340
Kill the men in the list

1569
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,980
They are my men

1570
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:00,379
Don't ask any reason

1571
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:03,340
This is politics
That's all

1572
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:04,500
Go...go

1573
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:07,020
You should work like
a tongue of flame

1574
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:09,860
Only sacrifice will elevate you

1575
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:12,900
Yov! Let's go

1576
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:23,860
If you ask for money...

1577
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:25,219
...this dog had better give

1578
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:26,820
Why are you lowering yourself?

1579
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:29,420
Patience is the watchword

1580
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:31,740
In politics patience is very important

1581
02:02:31,780 --> 02:02:33,460
We should be thick skinned like buffaloes

1582
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:35,700
Whatever should happen
will happen of its own accord

1583
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:37,580
Don't we need him
till the election?

1584
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:39,100
Don't you know even this?

1585
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:40,020
Scumbag!

1586
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:42,459
One of these days
I'll peel your skin with a belt

1587
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:44,740
I'm a classical poet

1588
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:46,500
I am the son of
Mother Tamil

1589
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:00,380
Aye, what is it?

1590
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:02,220
Why did you wake me up
so early in the morning?

1591
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:03,580
What is so bloody urgen-

1592
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:05,700
Congratulations, sir

1593
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:06,740
I am DSP Ganapathy, sir

1594
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:08,460
Feel free to call me
Whatever reason

1595
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:09,820
Whenever you need me

1596
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:11,700
Sir...?

1597
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:12,940
All the best sir

1598
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:14,100
Congrats, sir

1599
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:15,419
Next you'll become MLA?

1600
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:17,140
Move aside

1601
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:18,700
Given a chance
you'll kill my boss

1602
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:19,780
Come one by one

1603
02:03:19,860 --> 02:03:22,420
Bro, Dhanasekhar
Divisional secretary

1604
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:24,460
When I read the news
in the paper this morning-

1605
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:25,820
Bring the garland

1606
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:27,140
Move...move

1607
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:29,180
I'll take care of everything

1608
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:30,460
You need a personal assistant

1609
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:31,620
I'll accompany you

1610
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:33,540
All the industrialists
in the area are here

1611
02:03:33,620 --> 02:03:35,340
Hereafter you don't have
to threaten people

1612
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:36,900
Money will flow
of its own accord

1613
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:39,339
Move...move, man

1614
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:40,780
How long should we wait!

1615
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:42,060
Come in line

1616
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:44,259
Who is that?

1617
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:45,780
Do you know who he is?

1618
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:48,180
He grew up here

1619
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:50,420
His mother has come to see him

1620
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:52,900
Let me see if any dog can stop me

1621
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:54,940
The women's wing, bro

1622
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:59,020
I know you will go places

1623
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:01,180
I know you'll soon become a minister

1624
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:02,260
Sky is the limit

1625
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:04,060
Then he will forget us all

1626
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:06,700
Kumar, he is Ezhumalai
Our caste union's leader

1627
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:09,140
We are proud that someone
from our caste has made it big

1628
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:11,419
From now on, our caste
should be given priority

1629
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:12,700
Tender, contract, everything

1630
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:13,820
Keep this in mind

1631
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:15,180
Long live
Our leader!

1632
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:21,020
Long live
Our future chief minister!

1633
02:04:21,460 --> 02:04:22,940
Who is this?

1634
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:25,460
Should I open an auto shed?

1635
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:26,940
1000 autos?

1636
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:29,860
On the 8th

1637
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:31,299
I'll come

1638
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:35,339
You are older than me
and you're falling at my feet?

1639
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:37,220
Get up

1640
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:38,620
Who is this?

1641
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:39,940
Your father?

1642
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:41,500
You have come to bless me?

1643
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:43,420
Then why are you
falling at my feet?

1644
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:45,100
I should attend your meeting?

1645
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:48,820
I'm busy talking to someone
and you are interrupting

1646
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:53,419
Am I a father now?

1647
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:20,700
Kumar, he looks just like you

1648
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:29,379
Do you mean that?

1649
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:31,780
Kumar, can't you see for yourself?

1650
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:33,620
He is a carbon copy of you

1651
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:43,380
Look properly

1652
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:45,860
You are jobless, huh?

1653
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:47,419
The baby is ditto Kumar

1654
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:49,340
Forehead, nose
All the features

1655
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:02,660
Ask the baby's uncle to sit here

1656
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:06,380
Aren't you his uncle?

1657
02:06:06,420 --> 02:06:07,700
Come and sit down

1658
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:09,619
Sit down, 'mama'

1659
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:13,499
I was in the hustling trade long ago
Doesn't mean I'm still one

1660
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:16,020
Jeeva, aren't you his uncle?

1661
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:17,180
Sit down

1662
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:19,020
Give him the baby

1663
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:20,379
Don't cry, dear

1664
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:22,860
Don't cry

1665
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:25,540
Sir, I'll kill you
if my baby's ears bleed

1666
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:27,540
'General Election'

1667
02:06:30,140 --> 02:06:32,219
It's a question of life or death

1668
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:35,460
If they regain power
they will destroy us

1669
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:37,340
Chennai is your responsibility, Kumar

1670
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:39,940
All the walls must have
only our posters and our symbol

1671
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:42,380
We must come back to power

1672
02:06:43,380 --> 02:06:46,420
Otherwise we must
immolate ourselves

1673
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:51,900
Murthy, only our people
should win in the whole of Chennai

1674
02:06:51,940 --> 02:06:54,020
When this election is over
either we should be alive

1675
02:06:54,100 --> 02:06:55,419
Or they should be alive

1676
02:06:55,460 --> 02:06:57,140
When they come to our area
chop them to pieces

1677
02:06:57,220 --> 02:06:58,180
Kill them

1678
02:07:09,580 --> 02:07:10,780
The handle is too small

1679
02:07:10,820 --> 02:07:11,700
Make it big

1680
02:07:11,740 --> 02:07:14,180
Shouldn't the boys be able
to hold it properly to kill?

1681
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:15,860
What is it?

1682
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:17,940
Tomorrow they will be
announcing the candidates' list

1683
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:20,379
People are so sure
you will get the MLA seat

1684
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:22,580
We will start all our work
the day after tomorrow

1685
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:31,100
"Do desire recede?
Do senses pay heed?"

1686
02:07:31,180 --> 02:07:34,140
"Till the dying day
fate's hand at play"

1687
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:40,340
"Wind, water, earth eyes perceive
Mind says it's all yours I believe"

1688
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:46,419
"Will desire take a backseat?
Will senses retreat?"

1689
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:49,580
"Till the dying day
fate's hand at play"

1690
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:54,980
"Wind, water, earth eyes perceive
Mind says it's all yours to thieve"

1691
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:57,499
We will do it

1692
02:07:57,580 --> 02:07:59,780
Trichy district
Lalgudi area

1693
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:01,180
Chinna Sivalingam

1694
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:03,580
Trichy 1
Govindarajan

1695
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:07,299
Pudukottai
Ranganathan

1696
02:08:07,380 --> 02:08:08,980
Next Madurai District

1697
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:11,100
Madurai Central
Vellaisamy

1698
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:18,620
Shall we make Sivakumar
stand in T.Nagar this time too?

1699
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:19,540
No need

1700
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:20,940
His reputation is in tatters

1701
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:23,020
Even our own party members
speak ill of him

1702
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:25,980
Then we can opt for Krishnan?

1703
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:27,700
Okay, no objection

1704
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:29,700
Only problem is he has
a weakness for ladies

1705
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:32,300
Twice or thrice his name
has hit the headlines

1706
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:34,020
But people would
have forgotten this

1707
02:08:34,060 --> 02:08:35,379
He'll definitely win

1708
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:41,580
Next Egmore

1709
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:48,820
Kumar, your area

1710
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:51,700
Select Kumar
No second thoughts

1711
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:53,940
People will cast their votes
out of fear for him

1712
02:08:57,980 --> 02:08:59,020
Okay

1713
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:01,700
We lost last time

1714
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:03,540
This time we should
be on our toes

1715
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:05,860
Who has a good reputation
in this area?

1716
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:07,660
Why not our Selvaraj?

1717
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:09,060
That is the right choice

1718
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:11,180
If we select Selvaraj
we will surely win

1719
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:12,980
He works 24x7
On his feet all the time

1720
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:15,020
Are we unanimous on this?

1721
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:16,539
Yes

1722
02:09:19,580 --> 02:09:21,220
Next Thousand Lights

1723
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:27,460
Sir, give me a chance

1724
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:29,340
Let me stand in Egmore

1725
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:33,100
The people in this area
know me very well

1726
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:34,660
I've done a lot for them

1727
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:37,860
If they know I'm standing
they will vote for me surely

1728
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:41,180
If you decide
we will definitely win

1729
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:43,980
That was just a joke
and you took it seriously

1730
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:47,500
Kumar, are you tired
of killing people?

1731
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:49,420
You want to change your job?

1732
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:52,100
Most of the murders
were at your request

1733
02:09:54,260 --> 02:09:58,540
I think he is really serious
And you are sitting quietly

1734
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:04,299
Whenever I asked
you gave me money

1735
02:10:04,340 --> 02:10:06,220
So I made you
Regional secretary

1736
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:09,380
If you aspire for more
things will turn unpleasant

1737
02:10:09,460 --> 02:10:10,780
To come to this position...

1738
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:13,460
...you should have served
the party for at least 10 to 12 years

1739
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:15,780
People who have done so
are standing outside the gate

1740
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:18,500
Just because you have gained entry
you're asking this shamelessly?

1741
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:20,420
Don't you know
what to talk and when?

1742
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:22,820
Stand there quietly

1743
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:24,740
They will be annoyed

1744
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:29,540
Wait for another 10 years

1745
02:10:29,620 --> 02:10:31,380
Then I'll think about it, okay?

1746
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:36,420
What if they kill me by then?

1747
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:38,299
Can we worry about all that?

1748
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:39,620
That's how you should see

1749
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:41,460
Don't I have to
settle down in life?

1750
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:43,580
I have a wife and
a child to take care of

1751
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:46,420
Can I keep checking daily
if I am alive or not?

1752
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:48,780
Don't I need protection
for my boys and me?

1753
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:51,260
You come and stay
with us for a day

1754
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:53,100
You will know how
difficult my life is

1755
02:10:53,140 --> 02:10:54,780
You will casually say
kill this person

1756
02:10:54,820 --> 02:10:57,060
Or kill that person
And I should comply

1757
02:10:57,140 --> 02:10:59,020
Then you'll ask
for 10 or 20 million

1758
02:10:59,100 --> 02:11:00,259
I should bring it

1759
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:01,820
You will roam all around Tamil Nadu

1760
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:03,820
I should carry a knife
and guard you with my life

1761
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:05,500
How many streamers have I tied?

1762
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:06,860
How many poles have I erected?

1763
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:08,140
And how many stages?

1764
02:11:08,220 --> 02:11:11,500
I've followed you like a dog without even
a proper meal night and day tirelessly

1765
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:13,260
When I ask for a seat...

1766
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:14,580
...you ridicule me

1767
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:17,180
Touch your heart and tell me

1768
02:11:17,260 --> 02:11:19,420
Haven't I saved
your family's reputation?

1769
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:23,060
When I have the energy
and I am affluent enough...

1770
02:11:23,100 --> 02:11:25,780
...and the party is still afraid of me
I should settle down in life

1771
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:27,259
Whether the others win or not

1772
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:28,660
...I'll win and show you

1773
02:11:28,700 --> 02:11:31,380
Our leader respects you

1774
02:11:31,420 --> 02:11:33,180
And you're being so rude

1775
02:11:33,660 --> 02:11:37,300
In every area we've placed a man
like you whom we have trained well

1776
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:40,940
If we have to give you all seats
should we end up as barbers?

1777
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:44,459
You are talking as if you are from
Gandhi and Kamaraj's lineage?

1778
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:46,100
You were also rowdies once

1779
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:48,180
You think I don't know
the number of cases piled on you?

1780
02:11:48,220 --> 02:11:50,020
Hey coal-face! Do you know
whom you are talking to?

1781
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:51,140
I will chop you to pieces

1782
02:11:51,220 --> 02:11:52,140
Let me go

1783
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:53,420
Please sit

1784
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:55,100
How dare he talk like this!

1785
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:56,900
Stop it

1786
02:11:56,980 --> 02:11:59,020
Why are you also
arguing with him?

1787
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:00,700
Arumugam, sit

1788
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:03,219
For Heaven's sake
sit down, I'm here

1789
02:12:05,140 --> 02:12:06,900
Wait out...go

1790
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:08,660
No, tell me right now

1791
02:12:08,700 --> 02:12:10,180
Will you give me
a seat or not?

1792
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:11,900
Don't be scared
of these damn dogs

1793
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:13,860
(uproar)

1794
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:15,620
What's your problem?

1795
02:12:15,660 --> 02:12:18,100
What will you do?

1796
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:30,219
This is the money which
I've set aside for the election

1797
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:32,300
This is the money
for my posting

1798
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:33,580
I'll wait down

1799
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:35,300
My name has
to be in the list

1800
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:37,740
Otherwise I'll go and join
the party which accepts me

1801
02:12:37,780 --> 02:12:39,980
Already with open arms
they are inviting me

1802
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:41,299
Keep that in mind

1803
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:54,340
Silence...silence please

1804
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:55,540
Listen to me

1805
02:12:57,980 --> 02:13:00,740
Chennai district
T.Nagar constituency

1806
02:13:00,780 --> 02:13:01,900
Krishnan

1807
02:13:04,620 --> 02:13:07,740
1000 lights
Ramadurai

1808
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,220
Egmore constituency

1809
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:17,900
Represented by Selvaraj

1810
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:25,740
Perambur constituency

1811
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:26,900
Hey Selvaraj

1812
02:13:26,940 --> 02:13:29,180
Do you think you can win
in my area by ignoring me?

1813
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:30,740
If you dare step in-

1814
02:13:30,820 --> 02:13:31,900
Kumar, don't

1815
02:13:31,940 --> 02:13:34,460
You're a dog who pees
in his pants seeing me

1816
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:35,500
And you get a posting?

1817
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:36,260
Listen to me, Kumar

1818
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:37,540
What kind of justice is this?

1819
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:39,900
How dare you treat our leader
with scant respect?

1820
02:13:44,020 --> 02:13:45,700
Who has the guts
to face me?

1821
02:13:48,420 --> 02:13:50,500
You are too impulsive, Kumar

1822
02:13:56,980 --> 02:13:59,419
You're trying to threaten us
with that knife?

1823
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:00,700
Shove it back in

1824
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:02,100
Know who I am?

1825
02:14:02,180 --> 02:14:04,419
Pandiyan
66 murders

1826
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:06,580
I'll cut you into pieces

1827
02:14:06,860 --> 02:14:08,900
If you show us the knife...

1828
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:11,580
...are we the police
or the public to be scared

1829
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:13,180
If I point the knife at you-

1830
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:15,220
Why waste time talking?

1831
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:16,620
What can you do
with your knife?

1832
02:14:16,660 --> 02:14:18,580
Kill...go ahead

1833
02:14:18,620 --> 02:14:19,460
I'm telling you

1834
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:20,340
I'm asking you to kill me

1835
02:14:20,380 --> 02:14:21,620
If you don't kill me
I'll kill you

1836
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:22,980
Come on, kill

1837
02:14:23,020 --> 02:14:26,259
This old man thinks
a murderer gets a seat

1838
02:14:27,820 --> 02:14:29,299
Wait...wait

1839
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:31,140
You dare show us the knife?

1840
02:14:31,220 --> 02:14:32,860
Shall I pour this on you?

1841
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:34,860
It will corrode your bones

1842
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:44,540
Bring water at once

1843
02:14:47,300 --> 02:14:48,140
Hey Ganesha

1844
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:49,379
Why are you pouring it on me?

1845
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:51,300
I didn't aim it at you
Sorry, it was a mistake

1846
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:54,380
You poured very little
and his hand is scalded

1847
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:55,820
If you had poured
the whole stuff...?

1848
02:14:55,860 --> 02:14:57,380
His face would be a mess

1849
02:14:57,420 --> 02:14:58,900
It's acid, right?

1850
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:00,140
I've brought it

1851
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:02,100
Look here

1852
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:03,860
Don't do something
you'll regret

1853
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:05,100
Stay calm

1854
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:06,619
Our leader wants to speak

1855
02:15:06,700 --> 02:15:07,940
Why waste time talking?

1856
02:15:07,980 --> 02:15:08,940
Just nod your head

1857
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:10,700
We will bury him right here

1858
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:12,419
Silence!

1859
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:18,780
According to the rules of the party

1860
02:15:18,860 --> 02:15:24,100
...I dismiss Kumar for being
involved in unjustified violence

1861
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:31,780
I'll ask the police force
to take action on Kumar

1862
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:33,500
Law will do its duty

1863
02:15:33,540 --> 02:15:35,140
Are you telling us
to let go of him?

1864
02:15:35,180 --> 02:15:36,659
I'm saying 'not here'

1865
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:37,940
Don't you understand?

1866
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:39,540
The press is waiting outside

1867
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:40,780
You can retaliate later

1868
02:15:40,820 --> 02:15:44,060
You are asking us to let go
of the fellow who threatened us

1869
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:47,299
This is not my habit
But I have no choice

1870
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:48,820
Leave now

1871
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:51,860
Go, I'll follow you

1872
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:57,540
Kumar, let us go?

1873
02:15:58,460 --> 02:16:01,500
Where did you buy this coffee?
Not in 'Hotel Udipi'?

1874
02:16:11,540 --> 02:16:12,980
Our leader said
no violence here

1875
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:14,219
Let him go

1876
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:16,540
Hey! Clear out right now

1877
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:18,300
Everyone is boiling mad

1878
02:16:18,339 --> 02:16:19,620
Get lost

1879
02:16:31,180 --> 02:16:33,419
Unfaithful bloody mongrels

1880
02:16:33,499 --> 02:16:36,819
Stabbing me after using me!

1881
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:39,460
Half of them have left

1882
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:41,499
Security is less at home

1883
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:43,580
If we go with full force
we can kill Kumar

1884
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:51,740
Dance without touching the CM

1885
02:16:53,460 --> 02:16:55,500
They have ousted Kumar
from the party

1886
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:57,259
Now we can do anything

1887
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:00,140
Why are you fighting like this?

1888
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:03,139
He is a very good servant

1889
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:05,740
Pull him to our side somehow

1890
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:07,860
If you both work together

1891
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:09,620
...imagine the fruit of your labor?

1892
02:17:10,579 --> 02:17:12,379
You will become a Chief Minister

1893
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:13,860
He will also settle down

1894
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:17,540
Will my brother return?
Or will I walk?

1895
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:19,499
I was like a lion

1896
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:21,380
Look what he has done to me

1897
02:17:21,460 --> 02:17:25,860
My children are asking me why I'm not
spending time with them like before

1898
02:17:29,259 --> 02:17:33,700
My brother's wife who is
just 20 years is crying even now

1899
02:17:34,579 --> 02:17:36,780
We won't get a better
opportunity than this

1900
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:38,579
You will reap your rewards soon

1901
02:17:38,659 --> 02:17:40,659
Don't interfere
with my plans

1902
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:44,060
Can I ask the commissioner
to 'encounter' him?

1903
02:17:44,419 --> 02:17:46,020
Give him the order

1904
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:47,700
I'll tell you when

1905
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:49,780
He shouldn't have an easy death

1906
02:17:51,419 --> 02:17:53,499
News has spread all around

1907
02:17:53,579 --> 02:17:56,100
Random strangers
are spying on us

1908
02:17:56,140 --> 02:17:58,900
Our strength has
lessened drastically

1909
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:01,060
If they attack is in a gang
then we are finished

1910
02:18:02,060 --> 02:18:04,020
Take them home safely

1911
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:05,540
Okay

1912
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:10,580
Call me once you reach
your home town

1913
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:15,419
Why are you wasting your time?

1914
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:16,500
Go now

1915
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:22,820
Please understand

1916
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:24,419
It isn't safe here

1917
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:26,140
Everything will get back
to normalcy soon

1918
02:18:26,180 --> 02:18:28,300
I can take care of myself
You go peacefully

1919
02:18:29,259 --> 02:18:30,979
Can't you come along with me?

1920
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:33,100
Why?

1921
02:18:33,300 --> 02:18:35,620
Should the whole city
call me 'sissy' Kumar?

1922
02:18:35,659 --> 02:18:37,299
Everyone will demean me

1923
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:38,940
Don't I have self-respect?

1924
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:41,620
No one can harm me

1925
02:18:41,659 --> 02:18:43,579
I'm worried something
will happen to you

1926
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:47,100
Do you get it?
Take care of our child

1927
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:50,060
Go

1928
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:07,020
Someone go to Selvi's house

1929
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:11,180
Mani is there, right?

1930
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:18,380
Send someone along
just to be safe

1931
02:19:19,540 --> 02:19:20,860
How many of you are there?

1932
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:21,940
Totally

1933
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:25,460
We'll send 2 more men
along with Veni?

1934
02:19:27,820 --> 02:19:28,900
She has left?

1935
02:19:31,339 --> 02:19:33,420
I'm fine with just 5 of you
guarding me here

1936
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:35,260
Is there anyone upstairs?

1937
02:19:35,340 --> 02:19:36,500
At the gate?

1938
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:40,340
You've positioned one of
our men at the rear side?

1939
02:19:41,140 --> 02:19:42,700
Why are you staring
blankly at me?

1940
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:45,220
The entire city
will be here to kill me

1941
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:48,220
Are all of you equipped?

1942
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:52,139
I should also carry a weapon

1943
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:53,580
Are you scared, Kumar?

1944
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:41,780
What?

1945
02:20:41,820 --> 02:20:43,340
A tree has fallen
across the road

1946
02:20:43,380 --> 02:20:44,740
They are clearing it up

1947
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:56,780
Hey! Don't do anything

1948
02:20:56,860 --> 02:20:57,900
Don't kill him

1949
02:20:57,980 --> 02:20:59,860
Someone has to report
the news, right?

1950
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:10,300
Hey Kumar

1951
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:13,059
They conspired against us

1952
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:18,780
They followed us and
kidnapped your baby

1953
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:21,500
We tried our level best

1954
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:23,980
They were 50 of them

1955
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:27,059
Veni refused to part
with the baby

1956
02:21:27,100 --> 02:21:28,660
They attacked her

1957
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:31,180
We have admitted her in the hospital

1958
02:21:51,060 --> 02:21:53,660
Kumar, the baby is
with Murthy it seems

1959
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:55,140
Our boys found out

1960
02:22:10,740 --> 02:22:13,580
Before we go in
they will kill the baby

1961
02:22:21,940 --> 02:22:24,300
Murthy, Kumar speaking

1962
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:29,059
Let me know, if you want
I'll surrender completely

1963
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:30,620
Do whatever you want with me

1964
02:22:30,660 --> 02:22:32,059
But spare my baby

1965
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:37,900
See your baby
for one last time?

1966
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:40,140
Even we have a conscience

1967
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:43,460
If you take one more
step forward...

1968
02:22:43,540 --> 02:22:44,980
...I'll drop your baby

1969
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:47,220
Cry whole night through

1970
02:22:47,380 --> 02:22:50,500
'For what he did to me, let him
at least cry one whole night'

1971
02:22:55,700 --> 02:22:58,180
Murthy has kidnapped
my baby, dear

1972
02:22:58,580 --> 02:23:01,020
Call Mani and ask him
to bring my baby back

1973
02:23:01,100 --> 02:23:02,979
Whatever problem arises
I'll handle it

1974
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:09,380
Don't harbor a grudge
and play with my baby's life

1975
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:11,540
What sin has the child committed?

1976
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:13,820
You haven't seen
the baby, Selvi

1977
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:16,739
He's such a bundle of joy
I can see him in my mind even now

1978
02:23:17,820 --> 02:23:19,460
He means the world to me, Selvi

1979
02:23:19,540 --> 02:23:21,060
I wonder what they are doing

1980
02:23:24,140 --> 02:23:25,300
Please call Mani

1981
02:23:25,340 --> 02:23:26,700
There is no time to waste

1982
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:28,620
Step a little forward

1983
02:23:30,820 --> 02:23:34,540
Looks like water
near your eyes

1984
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:36,860
I can't see properly

1985
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:38,220
Come closer

1986
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:39,540
Come

1987
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:42,860
Your eyes are watering

1988
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:44,420
Are you crying?

1989
02:23:46,100 --> 02:23:48,819
'Kokki' Kumar is actually crying

1990
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:52,420
The other day you said
you can never cry

1991
02:23:55,340 --> 02:23:57,739
Your baby, right?
Natural reaction

1992
02:23:58,980 --> 02:24:03,380
God knows when and
how to punish wrongdoers

1993
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:05,979
Without an iota of shame

1994
02:24:06,020 --> 02:24:10,500
...you forced me to sleep with you,
or else you threatened to kill my brother

1995
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:12,540
Wretched fellow!

1996
02:24:17,660 --> 02:24:19,979
Every time you touched me

1997
02:24:21,380 --> 02:24:23,540
...can you see how I am now?

1998
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:27,860
I feel ashamed when I look
at myself in the mirror

1999
02:24:27,940 --> 02:24:29,100
Dirt

2000
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:30,700
I feel dirty

2001
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:33,500
Whatever I do
I'm unable to peel it off me

2002
02:24:39,620 --> 02:24:42,220
But do you know something?

2003
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:45,219
I never thought
it was you beside me

2004
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:47,100
I always thought
it was him

2005
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:49,860
You want the baby?

2006
02:24:51,940 --> 02:24:54,020
You won't get your baby back

2007
02:24:55,340 --> 02:24:57,299
What will he achieve
by surviving?

2008
02:24:57,860 --> 02:24:59,700
He will become
another 'Kokki' Kumar

2009
02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:01,820
And ruin 4 more families

2010
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:03,580
Good riddance!

2011
02:25:04,060 --> 02:25:06,980
It seems the police will
kill you in another 3 days

2012
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:08,540
My brother informed me

2013
02:25:08,820 --> 02:25:10,220
I have a lot of work to do

2014
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:12,660
First I should marry him

2015
02:25:12,740 --> 02:25:15,900
He has asked me to come
as soon as I can

2016
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:17,739
He has promised
to marry me

2017
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:21,700
I want to live the way
I dreamt I would

2018
02:25:46,820 --> 02:25:48,580
Your baby is lying
in your backyard

2019
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:49,820
Go and take a look

2020
02:25:53,220 --> 02:26:06,900
"You'll now understand life slowly"

2021
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:23,460
"When the time comes surely
even stone will speak sincerely"

2022
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:30,380
"With eyes open widely"

2023
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:56,459
They asked me
to kill the baby

2024
02:26:57,260 --> 02:26:59,660
But I didn't have
the heart to do so

2025
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,780
They are already upset with me

2026
02:27:04,180 --> 02:27:05,739
I wonder what they will do now

2027
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:07,540
It's okay

2028
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:10,060
Instead of killing
a baby and being alive...

2029
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:11,180
...I'd rather die

2030
02:27:12,140 --> 02:27:14,020
You ruined my sister's life

2031
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:18,460
Doesn't matter
Take your baby and go

2032
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:21,139
Treat is as my alms to you

2033
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:24,140
Every time you look
at that baby's face...

2034
02:27:24,220 --> 02:27:25,860
...you should be
reminded of me

2035
02:27:26,420 --> 02:27:27,299
Go

2036
02:28:05,300 --> 02:28:08,220
Will I survive?

2037
02:28:11,220 --> 02:28:13,460
It hurts real bad

2038
02:28:19,420 --> 02:28:21,580
I can't breathe

2039
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:35,860
Won't you ask even now
if this baby is yours?

2040
02:28:39,820 --> 02:28:41,780
Deep inside don't you
have that thought?

2041
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:48,420
Really?

2042
02:28:52,180 --> 02:28:54,020
So much faith in me, huh?

2043
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:24,460
Come we will leave

2044
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:26,459
Murthy's men are in search of you

2045
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:29,739
Have you booked the tickets?

2046
02:30:32,420 --> 02:30:35,660
Careful
Call us if there is any problem

2047
02:30:36,700 --> 02:30:38,980
Don't know how you will manage
with a new born?

2048
02:30:39,220 --> 02:30:42,700
As a friend I'm telling you
Instead of you bringing it up

2049
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:44,500
Leave him in an orphanage

2050
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:51,180
Don't mistake me
The situation is like that

2051
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:53,819
They will not leave you alone

2052
02:30:54,380 --> 02:30:57,860
The knife which is aimed for you
might even touch the child

2053
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:03,219
I never said anything wrong

2054
02:31:05,100 --> 02:31:07,180
I'll leave
Take care

2055
02:31:15,580 --> 02:31:17,620
We will leave
Don't forget us

2056
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:21,219
'What will we do without Kumar?
We should go back to our native'

2057
02:31:29,460 --> 02:31:31,860
Don't cry

2058
02:31:36,860 --> 02:31:38,180
Greetings brother

2059
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:39,460
How come you are here?

2060
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:41,580
Are leaving out of town?

2061
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:28,220
What?

2062
02:32:28,260 --> 02:32:31,540
Are you wondering why your father
has left you behind here?

2063
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:35,860
I wanted to bring you up
in a proper manner

2064
02:32:36,940 --> 02:32:38,100
I can't

2065
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:40,860
Everything is gone
You should be alive

2066
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:44,979
You should be alive

2067
02:32:45,340 --> 02:32:46,700
That is important

2068
02:32:47,660 --> 02:32:49,819
Appa, will die

2069
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:53,739
You don't get scared

2070
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:55,540
Some good person will come

2071
02:32:55,580 --> 02:32:57,059
To take you away

2072
02:32:57,820 --> 02:32:59,540
You will definitely come up

2073
02:32:59,620 --> 02:33:01,300
You are my son

2074
02:33:12,220 --> 02:33:14,140
Can I take you with me?

2075
02:33:15,740 --> 02:33:18,700
No appa, let me be alive

2076
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:22,220
That's right

2077
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:28,059
I've not even heard you call me 'appa'

2078
02:33:33,260 --> 02:33:35,380
One shouldn't be head weighted

2079
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:38,140
This is what will happen

2080
02:34:11,620 --> 02:34:13,660
Maa, look here a baby is crying

2081
02:34:19,460 --> 02:34:20,740
Yes

2082
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:23,860
Who left it here?

2083
02:34:23,940 --> 02:34:25,420
I don't know

2084
02:34:25,820 --> 02:34:30,500
They will give birth and then
get rid of the child

2085
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:33,180
Come...dear

2086
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:37,380
Ants all over

2087
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:40,180
Don't cry, dear

2088
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:45,300
Maa, see there is money

2089
02:34:45,620 --> 02:34:46,820
Money ah?

2090
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:50,500
Yaa, they have kept money
to bring up the child

2091
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:52,660
Take it
Spend it on the child

2092
02:34:54,180 --> 02:34:55,260
Drat!

2093
02:34:55,300 --> 02:34:57,020
Why do I need money?

2094
02:34:58,580 --> 02:35:00,739
I've 2 kids

2095
02:35:00,780 --> 02:35:02,700
I'll bring this baby along with them

2096
02:35:02,740 --> 02:35:05,340
I can work in 4 houses

2097
02:35:05,580 --> 02:35:06,979
And I can bring them up

2098
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:09,739
Why do I need this?
So scared to see so much of money

2099
02:35:09,820 --> 02:35:11,500
Take it and go

2100
02:35:11,540 --> 02:35:13,220
You can bring up the child

2101
02:35:13,260 --> 02:35:17,260
There will be a lot of problem
behind this money

2102
02:35:17,300 --> 02:35:19,660
Someone will follow me home

2103
02:35:19,740 --> 02:35:22,580
We should always be satisfied
with what we have

2104
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:24,380
If you are greedy for so much of money

2105
02:35:24,460 --> 02:35:26,460
Then we will have to face
so much of problems

2106
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:28,540
You have a child
what more do you need

2107
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:30,739
See

2108
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:32,860
How beautiful this child is?

2109
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:36,180
Oh see, it's smiling

2110
02:35:39,620 --> 02:35:43,620
How did they ever think of
putting it in the dustbin?

2111
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:50,460
Will you take care of the child?

2112
02:35:50,540 --> 02:35:52,100
Why are you asking?

2113
02:35:52,380 --> 02:35:56,900
If your husband was a drunkard
and beat the children up

2114
02:35:56,980 --> 02:35:58,780
Why unwanted problem for you?

2115
02:35:58,820 --> 02:36:00,820
Mind your own business

2116
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:03,180
Why you fussing like it's your child?

2117
02:36:03,500 --> 02:36:06,500
Even I've brought up kids

2118
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:12,900
Maa, careful

2119
02:36:12,980 --> 02:36:14,260
It's a baby

2120
02:36:14,780 --> 02:36:15,940
Educate the child

2121
02:36:15,980 --> 02:36:17,500
Don't send it to work

2122
02:36:17,860 --> 02:36:21,060
When you see his face
You will know he will come up in life

2123
02:36:21,420 --> 02:36:22,979
Take him to the doctor

2124
02:36:23,020 --> 02:36:24,660
Don't leave him like that

2125
02:36:24,980 --> 02:36:27,100
What's your name?

2126
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:29,060
For what?

2127
02:36:29,140 --> 02:36:30,500
Just wanted to know

2128
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:32,260
Not necessary, get lost

2129
02:40:11,220 --> 02:40:12,780
Aiyo...no

2130
02:40:31,980 --> 02:40:33,780
No...don't

2131
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:37,020
Please, don't harm him

2132
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:38,620
Let him go

2133
02:40:48,020 --> 02:40:49,860
Go...go

2134
02:40:49,900 --> 02:40:52,100
Just leave

2135
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:53,140
No...!

2136
02:40:53,380 --> 02:40:54,700
Go I say

2137
02:41:01,860 --> 02:41:03,660
Don't harm him

2138
02:42:23,860 --> 02:42:26,500
Cut here

2139
02:42:26,580 --> 02:42:28,100
Cut on the nerve

2140
02:42:28,300 --> 02:42:29,660
I'll die quickly

2141
02:42:32,180 --> 02:42:34,300
As it is I've gone through a lot

2142
02:42:34,460 --> 02:42:36,060
Don't make suffer

2143
02:42:36,820 --> 02:42:38,820
Cut here

2144
02:42:39,100 --> 02:42:41,059
Kill me

2145
02:42:41,740 --> 02:42:43,780
You are losing your aim

2146
02:42:43,820 --> 02:42:45,940
Hold it properly

2147
02:42:48,940 --> 02:42:50,620
Your hands are shivering

2148
02:42:50,740 --> 02:42:52,500
Can I kill myself?

2149
02:42:52,700 --> 02:42:54,540
Quickly

2150
02:42:59,740 --> 02:43:01,700
If you can't then leave

2151
02:43:01,900 --> 02:43:03,500
I'll accept you in my...

2152
02:43:03,580 --> 02:43:05,139
Will give you a MLA's posting

2153
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:11,139
It's a big wound

2154
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:19,420
Listen, I can't cut properly

2155
02:43:19,500 --> 02:43:20,899
I'll try my best

2156
02:43:20,980 --> 02:43:22,380
You have to adjust

2157
02:43:22,420 --> 02:43:24,540
It will take ½ an hour to die

2158
02:45:08,180 --> 02:45:09,940
They came

2159
02:45:11,580 --> 02:45:13,420
Even I'm going to die

2160
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:20,460

We live in Gandhi's land

Lack of time

2216
02:48:59,700 --> 02:49:02,460
