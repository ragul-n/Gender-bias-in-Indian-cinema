1
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,458
Yes, sir.
I have covered all the points.

2
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,541
Yes.

3
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,083
I was about to leave.

4
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,625
I am prepared
for tomorrow's presentation, sir.

5
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,750
You don't need to worry about it.

6
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,916
I know I came home late last night.

7
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:29,916
It's okay.

8
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,916
You're always busy.
You have no time.

9
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,083
I understand.

10
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,208
Move. I have loads to do.

11
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,083
What do you mean by
"You're always busy"?

12
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,500
You know my work is hectic.

13
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,166
Is Adhya hungry?

14
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,208
Reva, I said I am sorry.

15
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,666
I'll go get ready.

16
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,958
Yes, sir.

17
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,208
Our company needs it.

18
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,416
In fact, I was going to
suggest to you

19
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,583
that we should fire a few of our employees
and recruit some new ones.

20
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,666
- Reva, hurry up.
- Yes!

21
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,125
Samyak.

22
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,333
Do you have some time?

23
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,375
I need to talk to you.

24
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,708
Yes, tell me.

25
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:41,208
Your dad had bought a plot in the village.
Remember?

26
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,000
I think we should go there.

27
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,416
- It's been years since we...
- Mom, please!

28
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,901
We have already talked about this.

29
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,791
Why do you always repeat it?

30
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,416
- It's not that...
- Enough!

31
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,625
Mom, Samyak?

32
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,291
He left.

33
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,041
These days he's always in a hurry.

34
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,375
Yes, tell me.

35
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,448
I have been noticing your behavior
for the past few days.

36
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,833
You have been very busy with work.

37
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:12,750
I mean... I understand,
but it's not good to always be in a hurry.

38
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,778
You should take care of yourself.

39
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,083
And why did you leave without telling me?

40
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,875
Actually...

41
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,500
we are expecting some clients
in the office today.

42
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,041
So, I...

43
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,250
I will tell you everything
once I am home. Okay?

44
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,166
Listen, I'm getting another call.

45
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,541
I will call you later. Okay?

46
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,791
- Bye.
- Listen, Sam...

47
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,333
Your presentation was good.

48
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,208
Really good.

49
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,791
Our company is going to work
on that project.

50
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,333
Sir, I wanted to talk
to you about the same.

51
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,125
I mean...

52
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:52,125
I don't think they understood
my presentation at all.

53
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,916
Because they didn't react to it.

54
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,166
Don't overthink it.

55
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,666
Okay?

56
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,541
You did great.
Don't be disappointed.

57
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,166
In the end, it's the result that matters.
Right?

58
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,666
Samyak.

59
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,750
Mom asked me to wake her up
once you're back from work.

60
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,208
No, not now.

61
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,745
And you know she's going to
talk about the same thing.

62
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,500
What's the occasion?

63
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,930
We got a contract for a new project today.

64
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,041
- It's the boss' gift.
- Great.

65
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,916
Is Adhya asleep?

66
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,125
So, how's the work at your ad agency?

67
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,208
How are you?

68
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,291
- I...
- Hey, Omi.

69
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,267
Don't give me a high five.
Take your drink.

70
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,125
- Sanjay.
- Yeah?

71
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,541
Your drink.

72
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,625
Why are we meeting
on such a short notice?

73
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,375
"Let's turn the pages again."

74
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,083
Let's blow away the dust.

75
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,041
We can't rewind the time, my friends.

76
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,208
So let's live our memories again...

77
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,666
Well said!

78
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,250
- Wonderful, Vickya.
- Cheers.

79
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,526
Will you please come to the point?

80
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,875
Sure! Let's go somewhere.

81
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,791
Let's go some place and have fun

82
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,555
the way we used to
when we were in college.

83
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,416
What say?

84
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
- Yes.
- Good idea.

85
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,833
Where?

86
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:10,875
- Sanjya.
- Yes?

87
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,791
Let's go to Lonavala.

88
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,375
Vickya, I am not going to Lonavala!

89
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,958
- We won't go there. Relax.
- Okay.

90
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,333
- By the way, Samya.
- It's Samyak.

91
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,125
Where do you think we should go?

92
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,958
Omya, Vickya, first decide the place.

93
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,625
- It's decided.
- Really?

94
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:51,875
Where?

95
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,416
We'll go to my village.

96
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,416
Nice!

97
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,666
- Good idea.
- Great idea.

98
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,208
Very good.

99
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,125
Let me be very clear about one thing.

100
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,333
I won't be able to make it.

101
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,416
Come on, Samya.

102
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,341
We'll go to my village
the day after tomorrow.

103
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,666
Let's just have some fun, man!

104
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,041
- I have made all the arrangements.
- Vicky...

105
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,750
Mom has been pestering me
about visiting our village.

106
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,855
And going to your village
on such a short notice is impossible.

107
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,458
Why?

108
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,793
Short notices were never
a problem during college.

109
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,791
In fact, you used to plan everything.

110
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,041
Did you forget about them?

111
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,708
Let's do this.

112
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,976
We plan on leaving
the day after tomorrow.

113
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,500
You can join us the day after that.

114
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,041
You won't involve Reva into this.

115
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,500
- Rava is our friend.
- It's Reva.

116
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,750
Two days, at the max.

117
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,458
That's the spirit. Good!

118
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,291
- Samyak.
- Yes?

119
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,541
What's going on?

120
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,708
Where are you guys going?

121
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,416
What do you mean?

122
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:28,333
Look, Vickya texted me...

123
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,388
that you guys are planning
to go somewhere.

124
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,500
Oh, God!

125
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,791
I told him not to.

126
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,416
It's nothing.
Vickya wants to go to his village.

127
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,833
And he wants me to join him.

128
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,833
That's good. You should go.

129
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,000
I mean... you never spare time for us.

130
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,803
But you should spare some time
for yourself.

131
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,125
Why do you always have to taunt me?

132
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,916
- What are you doing?
- What?

133
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,375
We have to leave. Let's go.

134
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,708
And you're coming along?

135
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,675
I will tell you everything on the way.
Get in.

136
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,958
Come on.

137
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,583
I hope you know I'm going to Konkan.

138
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,875
Yes, I know.

139
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,791
Reva, will you please
tell me what's going on?

140
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,625
Reva.

141
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,083
Reva, where are we going?

142
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,041
Samyak, I told you.

143
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,375
For now, I am just going to tell you
how to get there.

144
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,375
All you have to do is drive.

145
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,583
Oh, God!

146
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,500
Take this left.

147
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,208
You couldn't have been quicker.

148
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,666
Yes, straight.

149
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:26,958
And listen.

150
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,166
You won't be taking the car.

151
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,583
Yes.

152
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,833
Seriously?

153
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,208
Then how will I go?

154
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,791
You're going to Konkan all by yourself.

155
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,833
I can't allow you to take the car.

156
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,916
So... how will I go?

157
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,750
Don't worry.
I have already talked to Vickya.

158
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,458
I don't understand
what you guys are up to.

159
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,541
Stop.

160
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,750
Over here?

161
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:04,958
Yes.

162
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,833
So I am taking the bus?

163
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,250
Keys, please.

164
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:47,958
Take care.

165
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,000
Is there no other seat available?

166
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:37,791
No.

167
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,166
Oh, the bag...

168
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,583
Give it to me.

169
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,875
Let me keep it on the luggage rack.

170
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,375
Come on.

171
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,833
I wonder what people
bring with themselves.

172
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,458
It was really heavy.

173
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,875
Atmaram Gavde.

174
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,291
My name is Atmaram Gavde.

175
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,583
What's your name?

176
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,500
Do you have a problem?

177
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,333
I just asked your name.

178
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,458
- You don't want to tell me? I thought...
- Please be quiet.

179
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,666
Okay.

180
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,458
What are you doing?

181
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:53,208
I want to see outside.
The view is not clear.

182
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,541
Are you getting a clear view?

183
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,625
It's too foggy. Wait a minute.

184
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,875
- I'll just...
- Do you want to sit here?

185
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,392
- I was just wiping the glass.
- I think you should sit here.

186
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:11,125
- No, I don't want to.
- No, get up! Take my seat.

187
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,083
- Okay, okay...
- Hurry up!

188
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,083
Hey, be careful.

189
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,000
It's so clear now.

190
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,875
Hey, take a look.

191
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,000
It's so pleasant.

192
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,041
Beautiful.

193
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,458
As a child, did you ever insist on sitting
near the window?

194
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,041
I always used to.

195
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:44,000
I am having fun.
Hey, that was awesome!

196
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:46,061
One should never listen to music on...

197
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:48,583
Please keep quiet!

198
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,583
I am not very talkative.

199
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,291
I wonder why people think so.

200
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,041
What?

201
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,416
Sanjya.

202
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:58,083
Hey, Sanjya! Samya had called.

203
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,458
Then call him back.

204
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,125
Where are you, Vicky?

205
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,541
You're here already?

206
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:19,351
Yes, it's been 15 minutes
since I have arrived.

207
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,291
Sorry, man.
I am extremely sorry.

208
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:22,875
You guys are idiots!

209
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,333
Samya, listen to me.

210
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:30,250
Take a rickshaw to Bhor Junction.

211
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:31,750
What?

212
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,083
So now you're asking me
to travel by a rickshaw?

213
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,250
Come on, buddy.

214
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:40,416
Come on.

215
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,458
Sir... hello.

216
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,041
Where do you want to go?

217
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,416
Sir, where do you want to go?

218
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:00,833
Bhor Junction.

219
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:01,791
Bhor Junction?

220
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:04,208
My rickshaw is right there.
Let's go.

221
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,583
- Come on.
- Go on, I am coming.

222
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,416
Please get in, sir.

223
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,500
Where am I supposed to sit, man?

224
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,750
I am sure you can manage, sir.

225
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:34,750
Go ahead.

226
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,833
Come on, sir.

227
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:46,125
Aunt, please move a bit to that side.
Come on.

228
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,875
There's a lot of space, come on.

229
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,000
Sir, please get in.

230
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,125
This is the last rickshaw available.

231
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,958
Otherwise, you will have to
walk all the way.

232
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:58,250
Come on, have a seat.
Guys, move.

233
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,458
Sir, excuse me.

234
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,833
Please have a seat.

235
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,791
Move.

236
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:24,208
See you later, buddy!

237
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,416
Like this.

238
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,250
Now I am going to pop it.

239
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:52,000
Reva, please call Samyak.

240
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,250
I will call him in some time.

241
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:56,125
Just ask him if he is there.

242
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,083
- Please.
- Right now?

243
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,500
I will look after her.

244
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,166
- Okay.
- Hey, what are you up to?

245
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:04,541
Having fun?

246
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,791
Hi, Samyak.
Are you guys having fun?

247
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,791
Yeah, right!

248
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,166
Those idiots didn't come to receive me.

249
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,541
I am traveling alone...

250
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,000
in a stupid rickshaw.

251
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,208
Reva, did you pack my charger?

252
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,291
Oh, no!

253
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:50,208
I think... I forgot.

254
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,666
What?

255
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,291
Hang up, I have to call Vicky.

256
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,500
My phone's dying.

257
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,583
Hello, listen to me, Samyak...

258
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,250
Here you are, sir.

259
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,791
- How much?
- 20 rupees.

260
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:03,958
Are we at Bhor Junction?

261
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,250
No, but it's not that far from here.

262
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,166
What?

263
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:10,250
Okay, bye.

264
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,833
BHOR JUNCTION.

265
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,208
Hello, Samya.

266
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,291
- Listen.
- Where are you?

267
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:32,750
Samya, there's a small problem.

268
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,291
Now what?

269
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,750
Omya's car broke down.

270
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,250
What do you mean the car broke down?

271
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,166
Try to understand, man.

272
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,875
They have taken it to the garage.

273
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,000
Vickya, you...

274
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:14,625
You seem frustrated.

275
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,500
Don't be upset.

276
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,375
Your nerves tend to
tense when you're upset

277
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,059
and it eventually leads to a headache.

278
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,723
Then you won't be able to think straight.

279
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,125
And once you stop thinking, you stop.

280
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
What?

281
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:30,875
You stop.

282
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,000
What do you mean?

283
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:37,750
When you can't think of anything,
you run out of ideas.

284
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:41,666
And when you run out of ideas, you stop.

285
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,291
That's why I said that.

286
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:51,291
Your friend will be here soon.
You have to be patient.

287
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,458
Patience is very important.

288
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,041
You can't get everything so easily.

289
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,625
You must wait.

290
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,083
Come on, come with me.

291
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,416
Sir.

292
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,333
Sir, please come in. Come in!

293
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:55,500
Why are you getting drenched?
Come inside.

294
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:13,833
Come, please have a seat.

295
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,291
What's this?

296
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,041
This?

297
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,375
My palace.

298
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
What?

299
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,458
My house!

300
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,625
Like the one you and your friends have.

301
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,188
That's where you're headed to, right?

302
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,083
Similarly, this is my house.

303
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,458
It has no doors or windows.
It's in the open.

304
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:45,541
And...

305
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,958
one should be open about everything.

306
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,958
You live here?

307
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:54,791
Yes.

308
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:58,875
You...

309
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,375
You could have burned my face.

310
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:02,945
It's for lighting your cigarette.

311
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,416
Sir...

312
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,416
you smoke a lot, right?

313
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,541
May I ask you something?

314
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,416
What happens when you smoke?

315
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,708
How does it make you feel?

316
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,541
It feels good for a while.

317
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:03,625
It relaxes me.

318
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,833
Momentary happiness, right?

319
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:15,916
Something like that.

320
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,958
You smoke for a moment of happiness.

321
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,500
Don't you think you're
wasting your life and money?

322
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,583
You were the one to approach me.

323
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,541
But I never stopped you.

324
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,833
And even though I don't want to be...

325
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,458
I am here.

326
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:49,500
But why do you need to lecture me
about my smoking habits?

327
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:55,000
It's my money
and my life that I am wasting...

328
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,250
not yours.

329
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,375
Come on, sir.

330
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:05,875
You're getting frustrated again.

331
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,875
Nowadays people don't really appreciate
when you try to help them.

332
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,375
That's fine by me.

333
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:26,958
Sir.

334
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:30,708
Do you believe in fate?

335
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:38,958
It always gives us a sign.

336
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:41,458
But we always tend to ignore it.

337
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:45,625
And it is later that we realize
we should have paid attention.

338
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:57,416
But by then it's too late.

339
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,833
That's why I always say
that people should have patience.

340
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,958
Patience is very important, sir.

341
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,375
I should not have said that.

342
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,416
Realization is very good.

343
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:39,583
You just experienced it.

344
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:44,041
It proves that you have a good heart.

345
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,708
And that you're sensitive.

346
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:50,708
Hold on.

347
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:55,125
If a person realizes something...

348
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:59,000
how does it mean
that he has a good heart

349
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,583
or that he's sensitive?

350
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,666
What do you think realization is?

351
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,083
It's...

352
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:14,416
when you realize that...

353
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:19,125
whether your actions are...
right or wrong.

354
00:44:19,916 --> 00:44:21,250
It's a feeling, that's it.

355
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,041
Correct.

356
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:25,541
To realize.

357
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,416
To feel.

358
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:35,166
But to understand this feeling,
you need to have...

359
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,333
real eyes.

360
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,166
No.

361
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:46,333
Not "realize," sir.

362
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,708
Clear, free from sin.

363
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:53,166
I got it.

364
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,445
You're still annoyed, aren't you?

365
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:01,583
Sir, may I say something?

366
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,833
Whenever you feel angry...

367
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:07,041
or annoyed or stuck...

368
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,375
you should keep calm.

369
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,666
You should close your eyes and
think about the good things in life.

370
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:15,916
It will make you smile.

371
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,916
I mean it.
You should try doing it.

372
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:22,351
- What?
- Try doing it, you will feel good.

373
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,375
I swear.
You should try doing it right now.

374
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,458
Just do it.

375
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:28,791
What will someone who sees us,
think of us?

376
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,625
No one's out there.

377
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,833
Come on, try.
You'll feel better.

378
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,916
- I mean it...
- I said no.

379
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:25,833
Smile a bit, sulk a bit.

380
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:30,500
That's how relationships grow.

381
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:41,041
Smile a bit, sulk a bit.

382
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:45,750
That's how relationships grow.

383
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,916
Let our joys

384
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,125
intertwine.

385
00:46:56,375 --> 00:47:01,000
You and I.

386
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:05,416
And this silence between us.

387
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:11,291
You and I.

388
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:16,458
And this silence between us.

389
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,250
The melody echoes everywhere.

390
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:31,333
The breeze flows with fragrance.

391
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:36,750
And joyful colors spread all around.

392
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:46,625
There's light everywhere.

393
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:51,500
And our hearts are racing.

394
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,750
The stars shine over us.

395
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:01,458
You and I.

396
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:06,000
And this silence between us.

397
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,041
Like a shadow exists because of the light

398
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:34,083
I exist because of you.

399
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:44,083
Like a shadow exists because of the light

400
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,166
I exist because of you.

401
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:54,083
The moon shines with a new light.

402
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:59,333
It stays deep inside our hearts.

403
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,166
When I see you I forget the world.

404
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:09,000
You are the reason I have everything.

405
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,416
You and I.

406
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:19,250
And this silence between us.

407
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:24,583
You and I.

408
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:29,458
And this silence between us.

409
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,958
Smile a bit, sulk a bit...

410
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,125
Sir.

411
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,166
You're completely drenched.

412
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:44,853
It's good to get drenched in the rain.

413
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:49,750
Let our joys intertwine.

414
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,583
You and I.

415
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,500
And this silence between us.

416
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:04,666
You and I.

417
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:10,333
And this silence between us.

418
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:22,541
Sage.

419
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:28,708
"Sage"?

420
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:34,041
So is everyone with long hair
and a beard, a sage to you?

421
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,958
"Sage."

422
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:42,291
Do you live here all by yourself?

423
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,250
I am not alone.

424
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:50,791
Look at this huge land...

425
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,666
and this road, and the lamp.

426
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:55,083
Those trees.

427
00:51:57,541 --> 00:52:00,375
And... look at this.

428
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,458
This tree...

429
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,458
is as old as me.

430
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:11,833
I'm not alone.

431
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:19,708
I mean, do you have
any relatives or friends?

432
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,916
I have you.

433
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:33,125
What do you mean?

434
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:38,250
Tonight, it's you.

435
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:43,125
Last night, it was someone else.

436
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,666
Tomorrow, it will be someone else.

437
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:51,375
And two lonely people can always
give each other company.

438
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:52,875
Right?

439
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,666
Yes, but... it doesn't last long.

440
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:06,708
Something like
your momentary happiness, right?

441
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:10,875
What?

442
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:12,291
Your cigarettes.

443
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:19,500
Cigarettes give you...
momentary happiness, right?

444
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:21,791
Similarly, spending some time...

445
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,100
with a person that crosses this path
gives me momentary happiness.

446
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:28,250
And what's important

447
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:31,708
is the joy and satisfaction
one derives from another's company.

448
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,125
That's the beauty of togetherness.

449
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:43,416
Sir, are you getting bored?

450
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:45,666
No, please continue.

451
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:48,458
Were you thinking about your friend?

452
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
He will be here.

453
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:51,208
I know it.

454
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:52,458
Wait for him.

455
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,625
It's always good to wait.

456
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,125
Wait.

457
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:06,041
I guess I have no other option.

458
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,333
- Care for some refreshments?
- What?

459
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,708
Have you eaten something?

460
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:28,916
No, right?

461
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,625
Come, let's eat.

462
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:33,416
Come on.

463
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:37,208
No.

464
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:39,458
I'm not hungry.

465
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:44,583
But you look hungry.

466
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,083
No, you can go ahead.

467
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:49,541
No?

468
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:54,833
Okay.

469
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:06,166
You were saying something.

470
00:55:07,916 --> 00:55:09,916
You were saying something a while ago.

471
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:13,416
About what?

472
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:20,458
Momentary happiness,
satisfaction or something...

473
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:38,375
One should not depend
on the company of those...

474
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,750
who provide only momentary happiness...

475
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:47,833
because it will cause
a lot more trouble later on.

476
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:54,583
And eventually, you'll get bored of them.

477
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:33,583
You want some water?

478
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,958
One shouldn't say no to water.

479
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,125
I will be right back.

480
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:46,958
Eat this if you get hungry.

481
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,250
Okay? I will be right back.

482
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,875
Sage, wait. I'm coming.

483
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,166
Be careful.

484
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,708
You might fall.

485
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:23,458
Sir...

486
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,500
would you like to have some?

487
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:44,875
Let's go.

488
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:50,750
Come.

489
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:57,875
Make sure your footfalls
are loud enough in the dark.

490
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,250
Or else you might end up
hurting one of us.

491
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:05,125
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

492
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:09,041
Don't you feel scared?

493
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Of what?

494
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:14,500
This... dense forest.

495
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:16,250
It's a jungle.

496
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:18,500
And you stay here alone.

497
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:20,708
Are you talking about ghosts?

498
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,625
No, not ghosts.

499
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:27,208
One should never fear ghosts.

500
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:30,666
One should rather fear people.

501
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:34,625
- People?
- Yes. People.

502
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:37,583
If ghosts possess you...

503
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:41,333
you know they will leave you
for another body someday.

504
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,958
However, if people possess you

505
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:47,041
you will stay frustrated all your life.

506
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,083
They continue to linger...

507
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,916
even after they're gone.

508
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,166
You are a fluent speaker of English.

509
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:10,125
How so?

510
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:17,375
I get to hear a lot of things
when I bump into people like you.

511
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:19,458
So I try to learn.

512
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:22,500
It's not that difficult.

513
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:45,291
What do you do all day?

514
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:47,833
I mean, do you work?

515
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:49,708
No.

516
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,250
You don't work?

517
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
So...

518
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:59,416
what about your livelihood?
What do you eat?

519
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:04,666
What's so funny?

520
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,458
It's a weird question.

521
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:11,041
This is how I live.

522
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:13,226
And getting food is not that difficult.

523
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,000
I just had fritters, right?

524
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:17,791
I know you had fritters.

525
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:22,333
But... what did you eat yesterday?

526
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,833
And what will you eat tomorrow?

527
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,583
I'm talking about your daily meals.

528
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:28,541
I see.

529
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:30,791
It's not that difficult.

530
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:33,791
People like you always give me
something or the other.

531
01:01:33,916 --> 01:01:35,166
And I survive on that.

532
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:45,166
- So you're a beggar...
- No, I am not!

533
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,166
I'm not a beggar. No way.

534
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:52,083
Get up.

535
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:53,541
Get up!

536
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:55,333
Do you see that board over there?

537
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,083
Pick it up.

538
01:01:57,166 --> 01:01:58,166
Come on.

539
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:00,416
See what's written on it.

540
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:02,958
Read it out.

541
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:07,726
- "Get your punctures fixed here."
- Exactly.

542
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:08,750
Come here.

543
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:10,541
Let me show you something.

544
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:14,375
Look, I made these tools.

545
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:16,458
I made this hammer as well.

546
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:17,791
And...

547
01:02:18,416 --> 01:02:20,541
I also repair shoes.

548
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,291
And do you see those tires?

549
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:26,000
I cleaned them.

550
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:30,250
I do such jobs to earn a living.

551
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:36,375
And it is for my mental satisfaction
that I talk to people like you.

552
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:42,666
I never had any expectations.

553
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:49,416
I believe, one should
never have any expectations.

554
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:51,875
Why?

555
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:56,916
If we do something with all our passion...

556
01:02:57,458 --> 01:03:00,458
it is natural for us
to expect a great outcome.

557
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,375
Expectations give rise to dreams.

558
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,083
What?

559
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:10,916
Expectations give rise to dreams.

560
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:15,250
And when dreams don't come true...

561
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,708
it causes a lot of mental pain.

562
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:22,875
Which is far worse
than physical pain, sir.

563
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:27,291
And most importantly...

564
01:03:28,666 --> 01:03:30,208
unexpected change.

565
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:36,208
Sometimes it pleases us...

566
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:38,750
and sometimes it hurts us.

567
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:44,458
When something good happens
you should be happy about it.

568
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,291
But you should also be certain that
something bad might be coming your way.

569
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:52,083
Similarly, when something bad happens

570
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:55,833
be rest assured
that something good is on its way.

571
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:02,000
Because change...
is the only constant in life.

572
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:12,541
That's why I say
that one should learn to be patient.

573
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:19,666
Okay, I understand that
change is the only constant in life,

574
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:23,166
we shouldn't have expectations
and that being patient is very important.

575
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:25,291
But tell me one thing.

576
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:28,208
Ever since you met me...

577
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:32,666
you've been saying weird,
philosophical things.

578
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,666
You think you're a philosopher?

579
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:45,666
No, sir.

580
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:47,458
No.

581
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:52,083
Even a fool can tell you

582
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:55,375
the greatest secret to life
when on his deathbed.

583
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:59,583
Consider me one such fool.
Not a philosopher.

584
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,208
No.

585
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:05,333
You still haven't told me...

586
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:09,333
why you live alone out here.

587
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:24,625
Forget it, sir.

588
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,250
It's a long story.

589
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:31,791
I'd like to hear it.

590
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:35,416
Anyway, Vickya, I mean...

591
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:38,458
until my friend arrives...

592
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:45,208
You will have to listen
to the entire story.

593
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:47,916
Please begin.

594
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,041
There were two brothers.

595
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:32,291
They were returning...

596
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,580
after visiting a carnival
at the neighboring village.

597
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,500
And they took a turn.

598
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,708
Did they ever get home?

599
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:52,583
No.

600
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:58,291
Sir... please don't interrupt me.

601
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:01,083
It's always good to listen.

602
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:07,875
Please go ahead.
What happened next?

603
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:10,958
They came across a pond.

604
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:26,458
While they were playing in the pond...

605
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,000
a woman came there.

606
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:35,666
I still remember her.

607
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,333
She was extremely beautiful.

608
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:42,750
Pretty.

609
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:44,958
And graceful.

610
01:07:46,416 --> 01:07:49,125
Anybody would fall for a woman like her.

611
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:53,125
She had long, dark hair.

612
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:04,375
Her eyebrows were so pretty,
as if they were drawn by an artist.

613
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,583
She had eyes as deep blue as water.

614
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:13,916
And her eyelids were big enough to protect
that water from flowing away.

615
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,458
Her lips were like rose petals.

616
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:21,291
And she had a mole on her chin.

617
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:27,541
Her body was curvy and voluptuous.

618
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:30,875
And she had a graceful gait.

619
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,458
Was she really that beautiful?

620
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:37,166
Absolutely.

621
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:43,583
You're already
in love with her, aren't you?

622
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:46,125
Not really, but...

623
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:48,333
She's really very beautiful.

624
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,000
Yes.

625
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,500
What happened next?

626
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:57,125
The elder brother...

627
01:08:58,166 --> 01:08:59,916
fell for her.

628
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:16,416
Inadvertently, he started
walking towards her.

629
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:29,041
He went to her and said...

630
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:50,750
Don't lie.

631
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:53,208
It's impossible.

632
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:56,375
It doesn't even happen in films.

633
01:09:57,125 --> 01:10:00,541
You see a girl for the first time,
hold her hand

634
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:02,416
and ask her out on a date?

635
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:04,750
You are bound to get slapped.

636
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:07,375
Why is it not possible?

637
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,083
Give me one reason.

638
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:13,625
Beauty can mesmerize anybody.

639
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:16,791
And he was just an ordinary guy.

640
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:19,208
Like you.

641
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,666
There's nothing wrong
in expressing your desires.

642
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:32,958
Everyone wants love.

643
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:37,625
What do you mean?

644
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,333
Did she really not say a word?

645
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,166
Her eyes did all the talking.

646
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,125
And that little boy...

647
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:58,041
he kept looking at his brother
and that woman.

648
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:05,555
She started walking
in the other direction.

649
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:09,666
The elder brother followed her.

650
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:14,041
And the little boy...

651
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:17,625
started following them.

652
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:32,750
And soon, they arrived at a bridge.

653
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:43,111
It was as if she communicated something
through her eyes...

654
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:52,458
and the elder brother
said to the younger one...

655
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:58,625
I will be right back.
Wait for me.

656
01:12:02,291 --> 01:12:04,333
And he left with her.

657
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:21,958
The elder brother
didn't come back for a long time.

658
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,166
But then a man came there.

659
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:35,458
He said...

660
01:12:35,541 --> 01:12:36,833
Hey, kid!

661
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:41,333
What are you doing here?

662
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:43,125
I am waiting for my brother.

663
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,083
Waiting for your brother?

664
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:51,583
Okay, but don't stay here for too long.

665
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,208
This bridge is possessed.

666
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:56,958
And then he left.

667
01:13:00,666 --> 01:13:03,958
The little boy kept
waiting for his brother.

668
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,541
The brother never came back.

669
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,958
So the boy went into the forest
looking for him.

670
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,291
On his way, he saw a man
sitting next to a fire.

671
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:22,541
What happened?

672
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:25,125
Did my brother pass through here?

673
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:28,375
What did the man say?

674
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,083
He said he didn't see anybody.

675
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:35,458
So the boy went back to the bridge.

676
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:36,750
Samya!

677
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:39,875
Samya, I am extremely sorry.

678
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:43,041
- Actually, Omya's car...
- What is this, Vickya?

679
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:45,541
Do you think I'm a fool?

680
01:13:46,666 --> 01:13:47,958
- I said sorry...
- Look...

681
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:51,298
I left all my work behind and
came all this way because you asked me to.

682
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:53,375
I traveled for eight hours.

683
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:57,833
And when I called you up, you said,
"I'll be there in five minutes."

684
01:13:59,000 --> 01:13:59,875
But I am here, aren't I?

685
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:01,625
I have been waiting here for two hours.

686
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:03,666
At least he was there to entertain me.

687
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:06,083
No, I didn't mean that.

688
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:08,125
I will talk to you in private.

689
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:10,750
- Come on.
- Sir.

690
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:13,625
Please stay.
I am not done telling you the story.

691
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:19,750
My friend is here and it's late.
Please let me go.

692
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,166
But you promised...

693
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,291
that you would listen to the entire story.

694
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:27,125
Yes, but he's here now.
And it's quite late.

695
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:28,892
But I have to say,
the story was really nice.

696
01:14:28,916 --> 01:14:30,708
Just a few more minutes, sir.

697
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:32,291
I should go.

698
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:37,000
Let's go.

699
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,125
Let go of my hand.

700
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:43,416
Keep walking.

701
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,166
Move.

702
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:13,291
Sir...

703
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:18,583
you should have listened to the story.

704
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,166
What are you looking at?

705
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,250
Let's go.

706
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:56,500
Come on, man.

707
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:58,541
You fooled me.

708
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:01,208
Come on, I said sorry.

709
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:03,058
You know what?
Why don't you just hit me?

710
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:05,250
Come on, let's go.

711
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:06,750
Don't touch me.

712
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:08,916
You're such a baby.

713
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:10,541
You should've come earlier.

714
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:14,291
The car broke down, man.

715
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:15,541
That's why I'm late.

716
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:17,291
Come on, man.

717
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:19,666
I have made all the arrangements.
Let's go.

718
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,208
"The car broke down!"

719
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:22,958
So, where's the car?

720
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:25,166
Oh, God!

721
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:26,583
The car broke down.

722
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,291
So, we left it at the garage.

723
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,500
I had to walk all the way,
only for you.

724
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,000
I shouldn't have listened to Reva.

725
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,208
Oh, come on.

726
01:16:39,916 --> 01:16:41,083
Do you know the route?

727
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:42,750
Yes, I know it.

728
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:45,375
Look, we'll have to take a turn here.

729
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:47,250
And then, we'll be there in five minutes.

730
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:48,625
Let's go, man.

731
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:49,833
Take off your hand.

732
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:51,250
"The car broke down."

733
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,625
That's enough, man.

734
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,083
Look.

735
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:55,750
Here we are. Let's go.

736
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:57,101
Are you sure you know the route?

737
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:58,541
Yes! Come on!

738
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:01,181
- Aim the flashlight at this point.
- Yes.

739
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,833
Bloody nonsense!

740
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,041
- Be careful.
- I know! Just keep walking!

741
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:17,416
Be careful.

742
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:19,923
- Aim the flashlight to the ground.
- Yes, man.

743
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:22,041
Nonsense!

744
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:27,333
I hope you know
that I'm here because of you.

745
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:29,250
We planned this for you, buddy.

746
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:31,666
"Planned this for you."

747
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:34,708
Then why didn't you come receive me?

748
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,583
Where the hell have you brought me?

749
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:55,125
Don't worry.
We'll be out of here in a jiffy.

750
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:57,666
God! I can't see anything.

751
01:17:58,208 --> 01:17:59,416
We have to go that way.

752
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:11,333
What the...

753
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:21,166
This is a foolish idea.

754
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:54,958
Samya...

755
01:18:55,666 --> 01:18:57,226
What happened?
Wait, let me carry your bag.

756
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:00,625
Call Omi and tell him
to bring the car right now!

757
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:03,476
- Samya...
- I want the car here right now!

758
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,375
Samya...

759
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:06,250
We'll be there in five minutes.
Why call Omi?

760
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:07,375
Five minutes?

761
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:10,875
We have been walking aimlessly
for the past 20 minutes!

762
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:13,041
Samya, will you please listen to me?

763
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:15,291
Please shut up.
I want the car here right now!

764
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:18,625
Look, there's a well nearby.

765
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:21,375
You can freshen up over there.
We'll be there in two minutes.

766
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:22,958
Two minutes?

767
01:19:23,916 --> 01:19:25,666
- I don't care.
- Please, let's go...

768
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,750
Let go!

769
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:29,166
You think I'm a fool?

770
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:31,958
- Sorry, man.
- To hell with your sorry!

771
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:34,000
Let's go. We are almost there.

772
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:38,041
Come on, please.

773
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:39,916
Please, for my sake.

774
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,458
Aim the flashlight properly!

775
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:07,000
Vickya, how far is this well?

776
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:08,416
Wait.

777
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:14,791
We're here.

778
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,125
Hold on.

779
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Give me your hand.

780
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,416
Come on.

781
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:33,333
Careful.

782
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:14,708
Move back.

783
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:26,416
Back off.

784
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:41,833
What are you doing?

785
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:43,166
Getting some water.

786
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,250
Are you done?

787
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:20,041
Here.

788
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,458
Easy.

789
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:34,833
Samya...

790
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:39,833
she's so hot.

791
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:07,375
Beautiful.

792
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,125
Pretty.

793
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:12,458
Graceful.

794
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,583
Look at her hair.

795
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:19,791
So long and dark.

796
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:24,125
Such a beautiful forehead.

797
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:27,583
And her eyebrows...

798
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:32,958
they look as if
they've been drawn by an artist.

799
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:34,958
Deep blue eyes.

800
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,250
A cute, small nose.

801
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:48,791
And beneath that nose, rest her lips
that resemble rose petals.

802
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:52,291
And a tiny mole...

803
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,083
on her chin.

804
01:23:54,916 --> 01:23:56,791
Her body is curvy...

805
01:23:58,583 --> 01:24:00,416
and voluptuous.

806
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:07,458
Curvy body...

807
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:10,208
Voluptuous...

808
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:12,291
Her body is curvy...

809
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:14,708
and voluptuous.

810
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:19,916
I have heard this before.

811
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:27,166
"Her body was curvy and voluptuous."

812
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:32,291
A mole on her chin.

813
01:24:32,916 --> 01:24:34,791
Small nose, deep blue eyes.

814
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,958
A beautiful forehead, pretty eyebrows...

815
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:40,458
"and long, dark hair."

816
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:54,125
Vick...

817
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:06,833
Hey...

818
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:08,666
Vickya!

819
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,041
Vickya.

820
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:19,125
Vickya.

821
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:22,291
Listen, I need to tell you something.

822
01:25:22,666 --> 01:25:24,083
Hey, Vickya.

823
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:26,583
Do you remember that old man?

824
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:30,125
The one we met a while ago.

825
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:31,541
Hey, Vickya!

826
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:35,083
Samya, forget about that old man.

827
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:38,291
I think she likes me.

828
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:40,875
No... listen to me.

829
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:43,208
Something's fishy.

830
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,833
Vickya...

831
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,833
I have a bad feeling about this.

832
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:51,583
Vickya.

833
01:25:52,166 --> 01:25:53,333
Samya.

834
01:26:30,666 --> 01:26:31,875
Hey... Vickya.

835
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:35,041
There's something fishy about that woman.

836
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:36,833
- Vickya, listen to me.
- Samya...

837
01:26:36,916 --> 01:26:38,541
- Vickya!
- Samya.

838
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:42,500
Wait for me.
I'll be back in five minutes.

839
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:43,625
No, no...

840
01:26:44,041 --> 01:26:45,392
- Please, Samya.
- Vickya, listen to me...

841
01:26:45,416 --> 01:26:47,625
Hey, Vickya!

842
01:26:57,416 --> 01:26:59,375
The old man told me a story.

843
01:26:59,833 --> 01:27:01,583
Is the same really happening with me?

844
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:06,416
Let me take it one step at a time.

845
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:09,333
They were two.

846
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:12,750
We are two.

847
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:15,916
They took a turn.

848
01:27:16,916 --> 01:27:18,541
And we did the same.

849
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:23,541
They came across a pond on their way.

850
01:27:23,958 --> 01:27:26,333
And we came across a well.

851
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:29,583
Then...

852
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:31,416
What happened after that?

853
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:34,833
Then, they saw a beautiful woman.

854
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:37,958
And so did we.

855
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:40,583
Hey, Vickya!

856
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:45,000
Hey, it's really happening with us!

857
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:48,833
What happened next? The woman...

858
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:51,125
They saw a woman and then...

859
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:54,250
they arrived at a bridge.

860
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:07,666
Then one of them followed the woman.

861
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,250
Like...

862
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,458
What happened next?

863
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:17,416
What happened next?

864
01:28:18,416 --> 01:28:19,458
What are you doing here?

865
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:25,375
What are you doing here?

866
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,500
I am waiting for a friend.

867
01:28:36,916 --> 01:28:39,000
Don't stay here for long.

868
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:43,458
This bridge is possessed.

869
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:01,375
Vickya!

870
01:29:02,291 --> 01:29:05,125
It's really happening with us!

871
01:29:08,291 --> 01:29:09,125
Hold on.

872
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,666
So what happened after that?

873
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,666
They were two.

874
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:16,541
And... we are also two.

875
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:18,666
They...

876
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:21,791
What did they do? They...

877
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:24,000
They took a turn.

878
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:26,541
Then they saw a pond.

879
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:28,041
And we saw a well.

880
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:29,791
Then they met a beautiful woman.

881
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:31,875
And so did we.

882
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:34,791
Then they arrived at a bridge.

883
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,375
And one of them...
went with her.

884
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,125
Then a man came...

885
01:29:43,666 --> 01:29:46,416
A man came to me as well.
And then...

886
01:29:48,041 --> 01:29:51,208
The boy first waited at the bridge

887
01:29:51,416 --> 01:29:53,458
and then started looking for
his elder brother.

888
01:29:53,541 --> 01:29:56,000
Then he found a man sitting beside a fire.

889
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,625
I won't go.

890
01:30:00,083 --> 01:30:01,625
Vickya, I am right here!

891
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:03,083
I am waiting.

892
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:06,541
Vickya, I won't go!

893
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:07,750
I will wait right here.

894
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:09,375
I am waiting.

895
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:12,666
I am waiting for you. Vickya!

896
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:17,083
Vickya, I am waiting.

897
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,250
Vickya!

898
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:39,458
Vickya?

899
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:03,291
Vickya?

900
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:16,000
Did you get hurt?

901
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,291
Did you see...

902
01:31:39,208 --> 01:31:41,958
a man and a woman passing by?

903
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:43,708
No, sir.

904
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:52,000
Where does this road lead to?

905
01:31:53,791 --> 01:31:54,916
No idea.

906
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:58,708
Then what are you doing here?

907
01:31:59,833 --> 01:32:00,916
I am visiting someone.

908
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:04,000
It's cold so I am collecting
wood for fire.

909
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,541
This is nonsense!

910
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:49,708
What's happening with me?

911
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:55,000
Whatever that old man
said is happening with me!

912
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:58,125
What happened next?

913
01:32:58,708 --> 01:33:00,125
They were two.

914
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:02,875
They took a turn and they
came across a pond.

915
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:04,500
There they met a beautiful woman.

916
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:07,208
Then they walked up to a bridge.

917
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:08,892
Then the elder brother
left with the woman.

918
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,716
And the younger one
stayed back on the bridge.

919
01:33:10,875 --> 01:33:13,625
Then a man appeared.

920
01:33:13,833 --> 01:33:16,750
Then the boy
started looking for his brother.

921
01:33:16,916 --> 01:33:18,750
Then he met a man sitting beside a fire.

922
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,458
Then the boy came back to the bridge.

923
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:22,750
Then...

924
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:26,125
Then Vickya came to take me.

925
01:33:28,541 --> 01:33:29,791
Then Vickya came to take me!

926
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,583
Why didn't I listen to the story?

927
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:37,125
Why?

928
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:42,333
No! This can't be happening!

929
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:47,625
That old man was blabbering a lot!

930
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:50,083
There has to be a clue.

931
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:54,250
What could it be?

932
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,041
Don't be upset.

933
01:33:57,333 --> 01:33:58,833
Do you believe in fate?

934
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:04,166
It always gives us a sign.

935
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:06,750
But we always tend to ignore it.

936
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:10,500
And it is later that we realize,
we should have paid attention.

937
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:13,791
But by then it's too late.

938
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:16,916
That's why I always say
that people should have patience.

939
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,875
Patience is very important, sir.

940
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:21,291
I don't care if it's too late.

941
01:34:21,833 --> 01:34:23,473
I am sure the old man
must still be there.

942
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:25,125
Yeah.

943
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:57,791
Sage!

944
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:03,041
Sage!

945
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:07,916
Where are you?

946
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,666
I want to listen to that story!

947
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:14,958
I need to listen to the entire story!

948
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:18,500
My friend is lost!

949
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:21,083
He's all alone!

950
01:36:22,083 --> 01:36:23,708
Please come back!

951
01:36:24,791 --> 01:36:25,791
Sage!

952
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:28,041
Sage...

953
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:29,833
Sage!

954
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:33,583
Sage, please come back!

955
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:37,250
I need you!

956
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,291
Where are you?

957
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:42,250
Sage!

958
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:45,416
Why are you doing this to me?

959
01:36:47,291 --> 01:36:48,500
Sage!

960
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:51,583
You stupid old man!

961
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:55,041
Where are you?
I need to listen to that story!

962
01:36:55,916 --> 01:36:58,708
Hey, my friend is lost!

963
01:37:00,083 --> 01:37:01,500
Hey, old man!

964
01:37:02,541 --> 01:37:03,541
Hey...

965
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:29,708
Sage!

966
01:37:31,916 --> 01:37:32,958
Sage!

967
01:37:34,958 --> 01:37:35,958
Sage...

968
01:37:37,166 --> 01:37:38,375
Old man!

969
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:40,500
Where are you?

970
01:37:46,666 --> 01:37:47,666
Sage!

971
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:29,625
Old man!

972
01:38:36,708 --> 01:38:39,625
Tell me the story!

973
01:38:41,541 --> 01:38:44,125
Tell me, old man!

974
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:49,166
Old man!

975
01:38:56,166 --> 01:38:57,250
Old man!

976
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:01,125
Where are you?

977
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:16,291
Old man, tell me the damn story!

978
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:21,291
Tell me!

979
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:25,833
I need to listen to the entire story!

980
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:32,500
Sir?

981
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:34,333
What's wrong?

982
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:52,625
The...

983
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,708
The story...

984
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:01,833
I was telling you the story.

985
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:03,750
But you fell asleep.

986
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:05,875
- What?
- Yes.

987
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:10,750
What happened next?

988
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:20,291
The boy went back to the bridge,
looking for his brother.

989
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:30,583
Samya!

990
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:34,458
Sorry, Samya!
I am extremely sorry!

991
01:41:34,666 --> 01:41:36,541
The car broke down.

992
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:38,291
That's why we're late.

993
01:41:38,583 --> 01:41:39,583
Right, Sanjya?

994
01:41:39,875 --> 01:41:40,875
Sorry, man.

995
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:43,083
Your friends are here.

996
01:41:43,833 --> 01:41:44,958
You should go.

997
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:50,625
Let's go.

998
01:41:53,916 --> 01:41:55,625
What happened next?

999
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:56,916
About what?

1000
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:06,458
In the story.

1001
01:42:07,916 --> 01:42:10,708
Stories are a part of life, sir.

1002
01:42:11,791 --> 01:42:13,958
One story took place yesterday.

1003
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:15,750
One is taking place today...

1004
01:42:16,125 --> 01:42:18,041
and another will take place tomorrow.

1005
01:42:18,333 --> 01:42:19,583
It's nothing new.

1006
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,166
You shouldn't waste time now.

1007
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:24,291
It's late. Hurry up.

1008
01:42:24,666 --> 01:42:26,458
You should go.

1009
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:27,958
Your friends are here.

1010
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:29,666
Come.

1011
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:30,791
Let's go.

1012
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:32,125
Come on.

1013
01:42:38,083 --> 01:42:40,416
Get in the car.

1014
01:42:41,083 --> 01:42:42,458
Go on.

1015
01:42:45,083 --> 01:42:46,083
Here you go.

1016
01:43:24,666 --> 01:43:29,375
The game is on.

1017
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:34,708
Right on this turn.

1018
01:43:39,916 --> 01:43:44,416
The game is on.

1019
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:49,125
Right on this turn.

1020
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:54,458
Let's find a familiar person.

1021
01:43:54,833 --> 01:43:59,666
Amongst strangers.

1022
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,541
The life that was lost.

1023
01:44:05,041 --> 01:44:08,958
Has been found again.

1024
01:44:09,041 --> 01:44:09,958
IT'S WISE TO WAIT.

1025
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:16,791
Come and meet me again.

1026
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:24,333
Accompany me again.

1027
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,541
Vickya.

1028
01:45:13,875 --> 01:45:15,708
- Let's turn around.
- Why?

1029
01:45:19,583 --> 01:45:20,583
I will tell you.

1030
01:45:20,791 --> 01:45:22,625
But where are we going?

1031
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:26,375
I will tell you.
Let's take this turn.

1032
01:45:27,666 --> 01:45:28,666
Alright.

1033
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,500
Well, what happened is...

1034
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:37,458
that boy...

1035
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:42,000
went back to the bridge
hoping that his brother will come back.

1036
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:45,708
Time passed...

1037
01:45:47,291 --> 01:45:49,166
but his brother never came back.

1038
01:45:51,708 --> 01:45:54,500
And the boy went looking for him.

1039
01:45:57,916 --> 01:46:00,375
He kept walking and didn't realize...

1040
01:46:01,541 --> 01:46:02,750
where he was going.

1041
01:46:05,583 --> 01:46:07,208
An hour passed by.

1042
01:46:07,875 --> 01:46:09,416
Many hours passed by.

1043
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:13,708
He kept looking for him.

1044
01:46:17,583 --> 01:46:20,791
His thoughts were filled
with suspicion and confusion.

1045
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,541
And in that state of bewilderment,

1046
01:46:23,833 --> 01:46:26,500
he was unable to see anything
in front of him.

1047
01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:30,375
Eventually, he ended up here.

1048
01:46:43,083 --> 01:46:47,750
I wish that boy had waited
a little longer.

1049
01:46:50,708 --> 01:46:54,291
Perhaps, he would have found his brother.

1050
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,041
That's why I say...

1051
01:46:59,416 --> 01:47:01,625
it's always good to wait.

1052
01:47:04,666 --> 01:47:06,083
And you did.

1053
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:11,500
Maybe that boy is the
reason you waited.

1054
01:47:14,416 --> 01:47:18,666
But that boy didn't realize
how long he should have waited.

1055
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:24,416
He didn't know.

1056
01:48:53,958 --> 01:48:55,000
What are you doing?

1057
01:48:56,083 --> 01:48:57,083
Nothing.

1058
01:49:00,708 --> 01:49:02,500
May I borrow your phone?

1059
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:05,250
My phone died.

1060
01:49:12,125 --> 01:49:14,916
Vickya, how much longer?

1061
01:49:16,458 --> 01:49:18,166
Omya, what's going on?

1062
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:21,208
She is so fast!

1063
01:49:21,333 --> 01:49:22,375
Go slow, dear.

1064
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:25,041
Come on, come to me.

1065
01:49:25,333 --> 01:49:27,666
- Your dad had called up.
- What happened?

1066
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,083
He wanted you to sign some documents.

1067
01:49:30,583 --> 01:49:32,000
Hold on.

1068
01:49:33,875 --> 01:49:35,958
Do you want to sit there?

1069
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:37,833
Yes, tell me.

1070
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:44,041
I need to tell you something.

1071
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:45,500
Go ahead.

1072
01:49:58,041 --> 01:49:59,500
Never mind. Avoid it.

1073
01:50:00,083 --> 01:50:01,083
And listen...

1074
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:05,166
tell Leela that I want
a few days off from work.

1075
01:50:05,875 --> 01:50:11,791
And I think...
you, Adhya and Mom should come here.

1076
01:50:12,958 --> 01:50:14,041
To our place...

1077
01:50:15,083 --> 01:50:16,125
at our village.

1078
01:50:17,541 --> 01:50:20,958
Mom wanted to visit the village anyway.

1079
01:50:26,375 --> 01:50:27,708
Reva...

1080
01:50:34,041 --> 01:50:35,791
let's just take a step back.

1081
01:50:37,625 --> 01:50:38,666
Okay.

1082
01:50:39,416 --> 01:50:40,666
Samyak.

1083
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:44,750
Samya.

1084
01:50:52,166 --> 01:50:54,750
Sir!

1085
01:50:56,416 --> 01:50:57,958
Sir, where is Kokanwadi?

1086
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:02,291
- Come, I'll tell you.
- Where is Kokanwadi?

1087
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:04,000
I'll tell you.
Please have a seat.

1088
01:51:04,708 --> 01:51:06,166
I am so exhausted.

1089
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:08,375
- Are you alone?
- It was a long journey.

1090
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:10,958
- Are you traveling alone?
- Yes.

1091
01:51:11,041 --> 01:51:13,458
- Okay.
- Please tell me. How far is it?
