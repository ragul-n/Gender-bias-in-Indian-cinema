00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,531
By, Paappi & Appachan

6
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,893
With the blessing of Jesus,
she has given milk nicely.

7
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,890
Thankamani.
- Yes, madam.

8
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,120
Give her little grass more today.

9
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,063
Hey, Mollykutty.
- Yes, Mother.

10
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,892
Kuttappy hasn't come?

11
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,394
Mother. l came.
- Came?

12
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,732
Did our children get up?
- Children?

13
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,399
Yes. Father and Paappi.
Now, it is 8:30am.

14
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,580
l am seeing those people who keep alarm to
get up at 8:30am for the first time in my life.

15
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,584
Paappi.

16
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:39,677
Appacha (father).

17
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,252
Don't you want to see omen?
- Yes.

18
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,423
Then look at my face, dear.

19
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,683
l want to see omen
and not a trap.

20
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,426
Come Paappi. Let's pee.
Pee without falling inside.

21
00:03:52,532 --> 00:04:00,268
Don't dance by seeing this.
For all this..

22
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,540
Oh. l am fed up of this
father and son.

23
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,768
l have told them 100 times not
to pee by standing in the room.

24
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,608
Playing by peeing in the morning.
l will cut that today itself.

25
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,613
Look.
- No, Mother. No.

26
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:12,546
l am going to cut leaf.

27
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,947
Father. Mariamma is coming here
in a state of anger. Close the valve.

28
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,348
Otherwise, the pump set
will damage today.

29
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,753
Kuttappy. Let's go to see good omen.
Take the vehicle.- l am ready.

30
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,786
My mother.

31
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,224
Take tender coconut, Mathai.

32
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,459
You are cutting tender coconut
like cutting head.

33
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,787
This is my livelihood, Mathai.

34
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,621
Are you living by making
others frightened?

35
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,292
Mathai.

36
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,964
Broker, why are you shouting?
- Yes. Mathai.

37
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:24,308
Mathai, do you know your value here?
- Rs.8.50.

38
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,739
What?

39
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,811
l was telling the price of
tender coconut.

40
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,308
Mathai, you have a nice value
among people.

41
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,314
Coconut bunch.

42
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,313
Hey, what happened?
You have been saying this for long time.

43
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,490
Hey, this is coconut bunch.
You keep the tender coconut bunch there.

44
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,818
Come. Don't stand here.
Walk.

45
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,654
You tell me what the matter is.

46
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,489
Why are you leaving Paappi like this?

47
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,994
Then what else will l do?
Tie him somewhere?

48
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,326
Yes. You have to tie him.
With a wedding chain.

49
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,094
Paappi also needs family planning.
- What?

50
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,430
Family planning.

51
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,835
Get married and have five-six children.
A wild life.

52
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,273
l didn't understand that.
- Oh. A nice family life.

53
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,512
Coconut bunch.

54
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,341
Coconut bunch is taken just now.
ls tender coconut enough?

55
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,780
You tie two coconut bunches
in your moustache.

56
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:11,355
Then you walk like this and give
that to your father. You please walk.

57
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,683
Let me see.

58
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:17,386
Like this. Like this. Like this. Go.
What? Uncivilised person.

59
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,521
Now, you tell me..

60
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,029
My dear Mathai, l don't have
time to spend by talking.

61
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,365
Where's Paappi?
- He was there.

62
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,634
Paappi.

63
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,178
Jesus. Allow to hit century.

64
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,684
One minute.

65
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,355
ls this pitch okay?

66
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,758
Don't tease me. Hey, throw.

67
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,838
Mathai. Mathai.
Paappi's wicket is gone.

68
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,445
Oh, my God.

69
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,377
We are only planning for his marriage.
Before that itself he lost his wicket?

70
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:50,113
Not that. There are three sticks, right?
The middle one is gone.

71
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,950
Jesus, that itself is gone?

72
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,889
Three sticks will be fixed in the place
whiling playing cricket, right?- Yes.

73
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,794
The middle stick has fallen by
hitting of the ball. Pappu is out.

74
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,400
Why didn't you tell that Paappi got out?

75
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,698
l am not out.
- Why?

76
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,874
As per international cricket law,
the first ball won't be thrown on the stump.

77
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,373
That is no ball.
- Whatever it is, Paappi is out.

78
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,313
lf you try to make me out, then you will
never find a place in the lndia team.

79
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,642
God promise.
- Hey, come. Let's play.

80
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,150
That's all.
- Let's agree that. He is a fool.

81
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,984
lf he becomes angry and takes his
bat and ball, then we can't play.

82
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,659
They have hit the stump
without any reason.

83
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,088
Hey, are you playing?

84
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,930
Will you agree,
if you would be out again?

85
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,758
Let me see.

86
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,606
Mathai. Mathai.
- What happened?

87
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,432
Our match box factory caught fire.

88
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,169
Jesus. Paappi.

89
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,857
Jesus. Father.

90
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,199
Pour water fast.
Out match box factory. My Jesus.

91
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,530
We can't block God's decision, Paappi.

92
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,640
Anyway, no one was
blocked inside this.

93
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,877
Jesus.

94
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,373
Father.

95
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,543
Father. Father. Father.

96
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,382
Let everything go.
Let's take father to hospital.

97
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:38,058
Father. With the next call,
this drama is ending.

98
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,458
Father.

99
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,891
How was my acting?
- Better than last time.

100
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,070
You should have acted little more.
l was to do little more.

101
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,071
But my neck was dislocated.

102
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:54,838
Paappi, does anyone know that
we have put the fire?- No.

103
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,513
How could they understand that?

104
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:01,643
Our villagers and the insurance
officers are fools.

105
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,518
Whenever we are tight of money,
we can put fire and break.

106
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,690
That fools won't understand.

107
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:21,430
" Splendid.''
"There is festival in the beach.''

108
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,043
Paappi, let's turn check post into bar.
- Go. Go.

109
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:31,547
These all are possible here because
vehicles are rarely passing through this place.

110
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,282
His bar.

111
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,116
l am not boosting him
because he is my son.

112
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,118
l haven't seen as good a
liquor maker as Paappi in my life.

113
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:48,362
Mathai. No one is there to compete
with Paappi in making meat curry.

114
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,298
Paappi, you explain how you
made that wild rabbit curry.

115
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:05,976
When the wild rabbit's meat boils,
then it cries like this.

116
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:06,810
How?

117
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,985
This is the sound of boiling.
That's cooking.

118
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,588
Hey, what is this?
Does the rabbit boil like this?

119
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,163
l will cut into pieces.

120
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,332
Father.
- Yes.

121
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,935
We are drunk too much.

122
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,171
lf mother sees, she will kill us.

123
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,237
How mother comes to know?

124
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,844
My daughter Molly will close the door
in an adjustment without locking.

125
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,675
Both of us will go inside and
sleep without Maria's knowledge.

126
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,416
She won't allow us to drink
liquor inside the house.

127
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,745
lf we drink from outside,
police will catch us.

128
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:52,193
We realised that it is safe to
drink with police. That is very safe.

129
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,305
Paappi. Mathai.
We reached home.

130
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,138
The house has reached here?
- Oh! We reached home.

131
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,641
lf we go forward, mother will get up
by hearing the sound ofjeep.

132
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,871
So, you push the jeep.

133
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,477
We have to push the jeep
because of your mother.

134
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,778
l am drunk.
l don't know anything.

135
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,614
Push slowly. Be careful.

136
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,722
What is the use of drinking so much?

137
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,553
Everything would be lost
when we push this.

138
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:29,660
Push properly. Push.

139
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,070
Whatever is there my stomach,
all that would come out.

140
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,899
What about tomorrow morning.

141
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,734
The sun will come out
in the morning.- Okay.

142
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:37,738
Daylight will come.
- Okay.

143
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,503
That time you will come.
You will say something foolish.

144
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,739
That time l will beat you.
- Hey, you go soon.

145
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,314
We have to go to see
good omen in the morning.

146
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,918
ls he become short after
joining here for work?

147
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,850
You are feeling so because he
has just come out of the jeep.

148
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,751
You go fast. Otherwise you
will become shorter. Go.

149
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,995
Hey stop. Stop.
- Don't make noise, mother will get up.

150
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:03,100
Then we can't enter the house.
Be a little decent.

151
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,367
ls there any smell?
- Let me see.

152
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,102
No. You just see mine too.

153
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,216
There is no liquor smell.
But it is better to brush your teeth daily.

154
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,941
You go and tell that to your father.

155
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,120
Hey. lf you say bad word
to my father...

156
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,119
What will you do if i say bad
word to your father? You fool.

157
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,954
Your father's and your main hobby is making
money by fooling insurance companies, right?

158
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,629
Father and son.
- Leave. Leave.

159
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,789
lf you say bad word to my father,
then l will forget you are my own father.

160
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,293
What is that sound?

161
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,969
Don't roll me.
- Maria. Maria.

162
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:50,979
l won't roll more.
- Not roll. Maria.

163
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,980
What is this?
Who has shouted mother?

164
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,150
l have shouted by calling my mother.

165
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,152
But your mother has come.

166
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,985
What happened, Kuttappy?
- l have come for a morning walk.

167
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,423
When l reached here, l came to know
that sun hasn't risen. Right?

168
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,326
Then we were thinking that
how to spend time till morning.

169
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,668
l don't feel that sun will rise soon.

170
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,768
Okay, l will come tomorrow morning.

171
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,232
Hey... She is standing here.

172
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,002
Oh. You have shown all these
drama after drinking, right?

173
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:23,940
One father and son.
Grown up like a bull.

174
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,014
lt's about you.
- Dirty creature.

175
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,344
That's about you.

176
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,180
Take.

177
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,789
Let's go away.
- Keep quiet and eat. l am hungry.

178
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,258
Hey serve them.
Came after burning own property.

179
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,027
They may feel hungry.

180
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,532
Four-five months back,
you have burnt your own theatre.

181
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,036
After that, now this match box factory.

182
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,362
People are laughing by
saying this and that.

183
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,538
Let them laugh.

184
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:54,208
ln front of villagers,
Paappi and his father are rich.

185
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,880
They won't know that
all these are rolling.

186
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,942
What they are seeing?
Hundreds of business.

187
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,878
Hotel. Bar.

188
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,612
School. Theatre.

189
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:09,055
Hospital. Chit company.
Market. Then what?

190
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,560
From here, we put there.
From there to another place.

191
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,392
From there to here.

192
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,726
When we are short of money,
we will fool the insurance people.

193
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,568
All this is because of our situation.
What else?

194
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,232
We possess a big house.
Possess vehicle.

195
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:33,350
l and my dear son only know
how we are running all these. Right?

196
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,184
Everything will be all right, Father?
All right.

197
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,617
Kuttappy, let's go to see good omen.
Take the vehicle.

198
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,591
l am ready.

199
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,171
Crow didn't pass motion for long time.

200
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,713
Has Kunjali's shop passed?

201
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,282
For knowing that, you open your eyes.

202
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,453
l will open my eyes only after
Annie comes in front of me.

203
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,449
You have to tolerate this
till l get married.

204
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,126
Yes. We reached.
Get out properly.

205
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:20,959
Jesus. Let me stand here.

206
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,699
Why this tyre is not
becoming punctured?

207
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,630
ls my position correct?
- Yes. lt's correct.

208
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,232
Oh, Paappi's matter.

209
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,577
Paappi become so wealthy by seeing
Annie teacher as omen every day.

210
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,474
lf he won't see her as omen for one day,
then that day would flop.

211
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,741
One thing is true.

212
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,650
lt is very beautiful to see
Annie teacher coming to school.

213
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,653
She is coming.
Open. Open.

214
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,343
Good morning, teacher.
- Good morning.

215
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,176
lt's my birthday today.
- ls it?

216
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,108
Happy birthday.

217
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,855
Hey, take that boy.
- Okay.

218
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,695
Come.
- Good morning, teacher.

219
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:24,863
Good morning.

220
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,532
Omen is there in the morning itself, teacher.

221
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,196
What is the use of having everything?
People must have little sense.

222
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,639
For make shame for me too.

223
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,540
l am searching for a alternate path
to go to school through hell.

224
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,040
Good morning.
- l took him.

225
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,544
Let me take him.

226
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,050
What is the specialty of today?

227
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,378
lt is my happy birthday today.
- ls it?

228
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:55,049
Yes.
- Happy birthday to you.

229
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,889
Hey, enough. l will give you one kiss.

230
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,227
l will give you one kiss, son.
Let me see. Where?

231
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:08,065
Yes. Here.
- Dirty fellow.

232
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,900
Now, l..
- Don't touch.

233
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,500
l am keeping down.

234
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,405
Son. Don't wash your forehead.

235
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,840
You come when Paappi calls you.
- Okay.

236
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,572
l have to frame him in a glass, right?

237
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,916
My first kiss.
- Last kiss?

238
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,915
Don't say any bad thing.
l just started.

239
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,750
l am going to resign.
- What?

240
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,426
Coming with you in the morning.

241
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:33,926
Did Annie teacher look at Paappi's face till now
after coming here in the morning like this?

242
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,760
Both of you have so much enmity.
Then why should l waste my time like this?

243
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,665
No. Not much enmity like you think.

244
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,269
A small problem happened
during my childhood.

245
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,775
l was studying in seventh grade that time.
She was in fifth grade.

246
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,610
We were good friends that time.

247
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:55,786
One day when we were playing
she had fallen down.

248
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:06,630
That time herjacket was misplaced.
l had seen a scare in her thigh.

249
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:12,134
l had shown that to some of my friends
and teased her by calling black girl.

250
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:17,036
That time she became angry
and took the slate of one..

251
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,903
..boy and hit my forehead with that.

252
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:26,310
l am carrying this mark
as the memory of that.

253
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,576
That was because of his behaviour.

254
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,151
Yes. That's due to my bad behaviour.

255
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,815
lt's bad to tell everybody about
a girl's secret, right?- Yes.

256
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,652
Why should l respond for that slap?

257
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:41,828
lf she won't have love towards me, then
she wouldn't come to teach in our school.

258
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,834
l will getjob somewhere else.
Some offers are there.

259
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,498
But l have to teach the student
in my village, right?

260
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,606
That is Annie.

261
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,501
Whatever she does,
everything has a reason.

262
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:54,840
She loves me.

263
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:59,848
But she can't express that
in front of villagers, right? Tell me.

264
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,849
You thrash and kill me.

265
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,113
Oh, yes.
- Don't kill me.

266
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,255
Mother.

267
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,361
Children, come out.

268
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,767
Fast. Fast.

269
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:21,605
Take it.

270
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,612
Everybody is here. Good morning.
- Good morning.

271
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,542
Master, your bus seems
to be a school bus.

272
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:33,946
l feel sympathy to them.
How long they will walk by carrying bag?

273
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,683
l don't have to put extra petrol for that.

274
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,115
Ajourney with children in the morning.
That's a fun.

275
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,725
We are telling Paappi for long time
to buy a school bus.

276
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,896
He is not much interested
in these school matters.

277
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:49,227
What a person who stopped studying
in ninth standard knows about school?

278
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,798
lt's the luck of children that they got
teachers like us and master like Dasan.

279
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,472
Don't make fun of Paappi like that.

280
00:22:55,774 --> 00:23:00,973
A person needs eligibility and
not education. Paappi possess that.

281
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,710
What happened? Shilaja teacher is
having a soft corner towards Paappi.

282
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,813
He is still a bachelor.
- What to do?

283
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:13,321
l am already married, master.
He is the eligible person to marry.

284
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,489
lf it was five-six years back,
l would have tried.

285
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:22,997
l wish to help Philipose.
But in this situation..

286
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,995
Don't feel bad by hearing this.

287
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,567
l have stopped the business
of lending money.

288
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:34,434
Don't worry. lf there is any
other option, you try that.

289
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:39,511
Okay. May l go?
- Oh yes.

290
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,620
Did you stop the business
of lending money?

291
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,123
No. l haven't stopped.

292
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,626
Then why didn't you give
him money, father?

293
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:57,029
l will give him coconut palm.
Do you know who he is?

294
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:03,868
His elder daughter Linda.
She looks like an angel.

295
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:09,274
She is having hair from here to
this place. Face is very fair.

296
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:13,382
Beautiful lips.
l have dreamed her a lot.

297
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:18,212
Do you know what this old man
told my grandfather who..

298
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,881
..had gone to his house
with my proposal?- What?

299
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:26,154
Nirappel Mathai is a useless fellow.

300
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,730
Then with whom he conducted
her marriage? With a doctor.

301
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,228
lf he would conduct her
marriage with me,

302
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:39,502
then l would have a beautiful son
like Shashi Tharoor instead of you.

303
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:44,410
You look like a monkey.
You know why?

304
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:48,241
Your ugly mother, that Maria.

305
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:52,082
l can expect a son like you,
if l marry someone like her.

306
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,758
Hey, useless fellow.
- Oh, my mother.

307
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,423
When l became ugly for you?

308
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:02,657
Did l come behind you by
saying you should marry me?

309
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,935
What you possessed
when you married me?

310
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,605
Don't make me say nonsense.

311
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,941
l won. l won. l won the bet.
- Bet?

312
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,204
Bet?
- Yes

313
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:22,613
Today, l told him that l will make you
call me useless before today evening.

314
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:29,283
l won. Take the money.
Rs.500. You keep this.

315
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:30,791
Oh, the father and son.

316
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,454
You buy broom with that money
and sweep here.- Drink this tea.

317
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,633
Hey, give a kiss to your mother.
- Yes. Like that.

318
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,067
Let me give some grass for that cow.

319
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,139
Workers are there to give grass.
- What is this?

320
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,310
Nothing.
- l closed my eyes.

321
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,241
Don't you feel ashamed?
- You are very innocent.

322
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,813
Why didn't you tell me
that she is behind us?

323
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,650
l haven't seen her, Father.
l am admitting your courage.

324
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,985
When l saw mother
immediately, l shivered.

325
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,661
You only shivered,
my life itself was gone.

326
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,730
Mathai.
- Oh, Murali.

327
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,259
What about the matter
which l told with you?

328
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,836
lf l agreed something,
then that would happen, Mathai.

329
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:24,604
No one is there in this ltthirikandam
village council who is as eligible as Mathai.

330
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,344
l am not much interested in contesting
in village council election.

331
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,357
But we are spending money
for the contestants of election.

332
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:37,025
That's why l decided that Paappi
will contest in this election.

333
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:42,693
Little power is needed along
with money, right? Right, Murali?- Yes.

334
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,199
ls there anything which Mathai
wishes that doesn't happen?

335
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,902
Now, we are also with you.

336
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:48,868
Father.
- Yes.

337
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,373
l am thinking about increasing
my reputation before this election.

338
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:56,308
Nerappal Mathai's son itself
is an image for you.

339
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,539
Paappi has only that problem.
- What?

340
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,848
We need idea.
ldea can do everything.

341
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,881
l will tell you all ideas.

342
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,585
The favourite people of this
lttirikandam village.

343
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,796
Neraooal Mathai and Nerappal Paappi.

344
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,501
The social service of these people
have been shown in the..

345
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:23,834
..live programme of lttirikandam
cable vision.

346
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:29,476
They have climbed the steps of
success by defeating the fate.

347
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:34,345
This father and son started their life
by doing scrap business.

348
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,250
We have started out life as scrap-dealer.
We are not ashamed to say that.

349
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,585
Because the people in Nerappal house
won't forget the life path they passed.

350
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,259
The path which Nerappal Paappi
and Mathai have passed..

351
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,930
..through was full of
thorn and rock.

352
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:53,264
Oh. Two sacred people walked through
the path of rocks and thorns.

353
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:57,271
Thus, the Nerappal family is going forward
by taking the love and affection of villagers.

354
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,103
Villagers are very optimistic
while talking about them.

355
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:05,609
lf Paappi and his father wasn't there,
then there wouldn't be a school in this village.

356
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,614
Hospital won't be there.
- Hospital won't be there.

357
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:12,950
Paappi is God of poor people like us.
- Paappi is God of poor people like us.

358
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,621
We like him.
We like him very much.

359
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:16,293
Hey, tell her to say all this.

360
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,952
He is our favourite.
- He is our favourite.

361
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,292
She should make it flop.
Favourite? What?

362
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,968
This is live programme.
She should have made it flop.

363
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,968
Jesus. Did l give her all money?
- Paappi, give me Rs.100 more.

364
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,300
Enough. You have spoken only half.

365
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,735
How will you and your father improve?

366
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,707
Hogues in Nerappal house.
Animals.

367
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,308
Son. l want to speak something
more about these people.

368
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:41,315
Catch. Catch. Don't go. Don't go.
- Leave me. Leave me.

369
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,817
Catch.- Leave me.
What is this?

370
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,320
Put her somewhere there. Hey take her.
Take her away from camera.

371
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:52,326
This father and son used to give everything
to the poor people in lttirikandam village.

372
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:52,996
Take.

373
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,562
What is the use of shawl for the
people who wears house coat.

374
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:11,004
The favourite of this village.
Our favourite. Our Paappi.

375
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,345
Do you want to hear
what Paappi wish to say?

376
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,677
Mother, you read the bible
instead of seeing this.

377
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:21,519
From my childhood onwards my father
has taught me about love and sincerity.

378
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:26,356
My father used to say that there are only
two people in the world are humble.

379
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,930
Firstly, one is Mother Therasa.

380
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:33,762
My humbleness won't allow me to
say who is the second person.

381
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,703
Current is gone.
- Good.

382
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,967
The transformer might have
burst by hearing lies.

383
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,142
Dirty fellows.

384
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:42,370
Mother.
- Yes.

385
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,979
Brother has gone to see omen, right?

386
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,208
Everyday he is having that madness.
- His omen has come in our house.

387
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,388
Mother.
- My Jesus. Who is this?

388
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,820
l thought you have forgotten this route.

389
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,391
l am busy always.

390
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:01,224
Now, l have gone to my friend's
house for her engagement.

391
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:05,562
Thottunkal Mary's daughter, right?
We are also going there.

392
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,570
lf l go away from here without coming here,
then mother you will kill me, right?

393
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,901
l will give you one.
- Where is father?

394
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,077
Father is sleeping.

395
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:18,245
Brother Paappi has gone out for seeing
someone like he usually goes.

396
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,746
Oh, is it?

397
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:24,579
ls it enough to participate
in friend's engagement?

398
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:29,920
You also need a marriage, right?
- My mother is also saying this.

399
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,029
Shankaran is coming with
proposals every day.

400
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:33,925
Here too.

401
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,430
We are also planning
to conduct Paappi's marriage.

402
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:37,601
Conduct it fast, Mother.

403
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,597
We should conduct his marriage with
a girl who is capable of controlling Paappi.

404
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,774
Not from this village.
From outside this village.

405
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,770
We should conduct his marriage with
the daughter of some Kashmir soldier.

406
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,776
Then only he will become disciplined.

407
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,950
l am going.
l have to attend the first period.

408
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,780
Dear. Drink something.
- No, Mother. l will drink afterwards.

409
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,120
Nothing is there in her mind.

410
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:08,131
Why he is going to see her everyday
like a dog goes to market.

411
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:13,570
First Panipat war started in 1526.

412
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:20,142
Barbar who came here and
lbrahim Lodi, the ruler of that time..

413
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,811
Vijeesh. Stand up.

414
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,581
Who was the rival of Barbar
during first Panipat war?

415
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,324
How long you are sitting in
the same class, Vijeesh?

416
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,822
Aren't you ashamed?

417
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,324
What happened?
Are you not well?

418
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,160
Why Suresh is sleeping?
What happened?

419
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,164
He...he is having head ache.

420
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,006
Both of you are not well at same time?

421
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,772
He...he..
- Why are you talking like this?

422
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,343
Teacher. Both of them drank liquor.

423
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,849
Liquor?

424
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,177
We can't live it like that.

425
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,181
This is not at bus stand, railway station,
theatre or tea shop.

426
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,354
lt is happened in a school.

427
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:13,254
Children are drinking and
sitting in the class room.

428
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,800
Master, you should try to
understand our situation also.

429
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,196
Everything is right, teacher.
What will l do?

430
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:25,201
The owner of this school and
the person who makes..

431
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,808
..liquor in the next plot are
Nerappal Mathai and Paappi.

432
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:33,040
Everyone knows this.
To whom will we complaint for that?

433
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:33,876
That's true.

434
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,383
lf we say something like that, then they
will remove the school itself from here.

435
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,555
That is profitable for them
than running this school.

436
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,226
While thinking from Paappi's side..
- Teacher, you keep quiet.

437
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,559
Let me talk to Mathai.

438
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:49,722
Where? He won't talk.
Rajappan master is their person.

439
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,394
Why should we blame Headmaster?

440
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,570
The student who is sitting in
the same class for three times..

441
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,831
..and doing nonsense like this,
then we should give TC for him.

442
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,475
l will make it an issue in the
PTA meeting day after tomorrow.

443
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,969
Teacher, this is not the
problem of this school.

444
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,508
This is the problem of entire village.

445
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,309
They are doing all this
because they knew that no..

446
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,019
..one is here to question the
people in Nerappal house.- Yes.

447
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,752
The time for a change
all this is reached.

448
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:17,924
For that, there is no use of striking
and conducting PTA meeting.

449
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,263
We should need the
power to respond.

450
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:25,260
That's why we are forcing you to contest
in the coming village council election.

451
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,269
My job is teaching people, master.

452
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,940
Why can't you serve this village?

453
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,110
Then Dasan master,
you contest in election.

454
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,940
l do not belong to this village.

455
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,606
No one else would get
as much as support you get.

456
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:46,219
Teacher, they will say something like this.
The opposite contestant is Paappi.

457
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,119
lf you contest in the election,
you will lose yourjob.

458
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,953
For contesting in the election,
you have to resign the job.

459
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,726
This is an aided school,
so you can take a long leave.

460
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,064
So that threatening is
not needed, teacher.

461
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,733
l just said what l felt.

462
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,899
You have started with the
matter of school and reached..

463
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,630
..the matter of making me to
take leave for election

464
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,568
Don't take it as silly.
We are serious.

465
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,979
Teacher, you think and
take a positive decision.

466
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,809
Leave it, master.

467
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,913
Hello.
- Shailaja, here, Paappi.

468
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,652
Oh.- Don't tell her that l have
told you, Paappi.- Okay.

469
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,685
Kuttappy, close the vehicle.

470
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,421
Why are you looking?

471
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,255
Round-eyed girl.
Pumpkin-eyed girl. Black girl.

472
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,591
Hey.
- What? Hey?

473
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,431
l heard that you are going
to block Paappi's drinking.

474
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,604
By conducting PTA meeting.

475
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:09,936
Here. Here.

476
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:15,443
You have seen only the old Paappi
who had played with you.

477
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:20,516
Today, Paappi is a big establishment
by giving and taking.

478
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,709
You know that.

479
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:27,048
You are pretending that
you don't know anything.

480
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,623
Don't show that, Paappi.

481
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:31,624
Today, this play will come to an end.

482
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:39,133
l heard a talking in the school that
you are contesting against Paappi.

483
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:44,806
No, dear. No.
You haven't grown to oppose Paappi.

484
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:49,812
lf Paappi wished something,
Paappi would win that.

485
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:54,307
lf you have some such dream,
leave it as nightmare.

486
00:35:56,687 --> 00:36:00,487
Paappi will contest in the election
in this village council. And win.

487
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:05,324
l will start liquor making as a small
scale business in this village.

488
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:11,992
Thus, l will make this as a liquor village.
What will you do to this Paappi, black girl?

489
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:18,107
Remember one this.
You are living in this Paappi's mercy.

490
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,834
The salary which this Paappi is
giving you..- Stop it.

491
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,614
Speaking for long time. Paappi..

492
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,085
Whose Paappi are you?
Paappi of where?

493
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,786
Fool who doesn't have
common sense and education.

494
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,018
Very nice.
- Hey. Hey.

495
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,964
You told me that l know only
that seventh standard boy, right?

496
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,292
You don't know this Annie
after fifth grade.

497
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,969
This is road.

498
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,206
Otherwise, l would have
given you one slap.

499
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,106
You said that you are
an establishment.

500
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:57,810
Hey. Do you know how to write the word
establishment in Malayalam without mistake?

501
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:05,112
Wearing white dress and a dirty glass.
Came with this dirty face.

502
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,552
lf you come to see me in the
morning with this vehicle..

503
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:13,389
..while l am going to school,
then l will pierce your eyes.

504
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:14,460
Understood?

505
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,400
Till now, l haven't thought about
contesting in election.

506
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,064
Because of this show you
have done here.

507
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,638
l have decided to contest
against you in the election.

508
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,414
lf you have courage,
then contest against me.

509
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:31,739
Let's see that time.

510
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,420
Paappi.

511
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:45,929
Stop there.

512
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:18,790
See. See this. This is Annie's leg.
l am catching it.

513
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,626
Please don't contest against me
by hearing all this.

514
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,131
l have to contest.

515
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,633
l have spent some money for that.

516
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,203
lt's not Friday today.
Time is not 4.30pm.

517
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,305
We haven't met.

518
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,476
A scene like this hasn't happened.
A show like this hasn't happened.

519
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,539
You have taken this decision now.
Please change that.

520
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,137
No.

521
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:42,048
lf my late father comes and tells me,
then too l won't change my decision.

522
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,984
Oh.

523
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:49,156
When l begged you to avoid one war,
are you cutting my hair by sitting in my head?

524
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,088
Then let's see.
- Yes.

525
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,737
l have done all this in a hurry.
That wasn't needed, right?

526
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,770
Should we get back
the fired cracker?

527
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,274
There are lots of people
to say all these.

528
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,314
We have to live in this village itself.

529
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,710
Five years back, when your father died,
this Paappi and Mathai..

530
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,580
..had given his job for you.
Don't forget that.

531
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,585
That is not his favour like he says.

532
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,252
lt is the right of children to get the
job of father, if he dies while in service.

533
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,025
l am taking salary from them
after teaching the student.

534
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,529
Mother, you don't worry.
We have the support of party.

535
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,159
Then we are also with you.

536
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:36,705
l don't know anything.
What all l have to see, my Jesus?

537
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,036
Dasan Master.
- Yes.

538
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,941
Would my decision become wrong?

539
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,118
There must be lot of expenses
in the election, right?

540
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,122
Annie teacher, why are you
getting frightened.

541
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:59,021
Good people will come to help
the daughter of ideal teacher..

542
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,564
..and villager's favourite
Varghese master.

543
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:21,910
Gone?

544
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,981
Damaged my umbrella?
l will kill you.

545
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:32,158
Teacher. l like you, teacher.
l like you very much.

546
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,499
Teacher, you decided to
reply for Paappi, right?

547
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,098
Ladies should be like this.

548
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:41,670
Teacher, you contest in the election.
This Shashankan agreed to help you.

549
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,342
For that how much money
l have to spent, l won't mind.

550
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,841
Won't mind. Won't mind.
- Boss won't mind anything.

551
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,343
Stop it. Stop. Fools.

552
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,016
That's not due to the
love to you, teacher.

553
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:57,415
My aim is to defeat them.
Enemy's enemy.

554
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:58,745
See me like that.

555
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:02,681
Whoever contest against Paappi,
l will spent money and defeat him.

556
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,361
Defeat him. Defeat him.
- Stop it. - Master.

557
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:06,359
Please come.

558
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,361
Some problem is there in his arrival.

559
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,603
Teacher. Party and Mathai
will spend money nicely.

560
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,374
So, we need a person to spent money.

561
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,471
lf it is Shashankan,
then what is the problem?

562
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,211
Where do we get a fool like him from?

563
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:27,043
Come. Come. Come.
- Where is it going?

564
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,719
Are you laying eggs in time?
- That is male and not female.

565
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,218
l will give you one.
Come. Come. Come.

566
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,818
See. He is a useless.
He is enough.

567
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:49,501
l'm requesting you to cast your vote for Paappi
the favourite person of lttirikandam village.

568
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:55,737

00:41:55,946 --> 00:42:01,407

my class, dear singer.''

570
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:06,850
" My friend who makes everything
which he touches into Gold.''

571
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,924
" My family member..''

572
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,756
" Cast vote for Anni teacher
who gives love to everyone..''

573
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:21,266

"Paappi will fails.'' " Teacher will win.''

576
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:37,716
l am asking.
ln Asian contract..

577
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:46,120
l am saying that would be
a treat for Malayalam.

578
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,295
Sister.
- Mother.

579
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,967
Let.- Sorry.
- Light.

580
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:55,294
Sister. Sisters, please cast vote for me.

581
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,968
Kuttappy. Walk in the side.

582
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,904
We don't need the bad name
of touching ladies.

583
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,910
That is the only thing which we don't have.

584
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,847
Are you confessing there?

585
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,510
Father, l was thinking that
l should work for Annie.

586
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,851
What did you say?
- Then l can see her always.

587
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,356
Aren't you ashamed?

588
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:59,525
Mother. You know, right?
- Who will l pray for?

589
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:06,875
Don't forget. You know, right?
- Where is Rajappan, Kalyani?

590
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:07,941
He has gone out.

591
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,939
You should cast the 15 votes
of this house for him.

592
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:15,550
We all are one, Kalyani.
- Father, come here.

593
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,787
Father, what you have done?

594
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,719
l had a wish to hug her from
my childhood. Now, l've done it.

595
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,821
Don't give me a bad name
for beating father.

596
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,223
How long l will hug your mother?

597
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,497
Don't come with me.
- l will come.

598
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,395
Next house is Kausalya's.
She had fooled me several times.

599
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,233
Anyway, it is good that
election campaign is over.

600
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,833
lf it would be there for three days more,
then my mouth would..

601
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,839
..be extended up to the
head by laughing.

602
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,907
Where is my father?
- He is taking rest in the house.

603
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,239
ls it?
- l am also going to take rest.

604
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,583
Don't call me for any
programme today.

605
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,269
What is this?
Without any short notice.

606
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,837
Who are you? Mother.

607
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,601
l don't want to know who you are.

608
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,445
What is the matter?
Who are you?

609
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:18,205
What you want?

610
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:26,285
Oh! You want this.
- Paappi. Don't think anything.

611
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,286
Thrash them.

612
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,696
Give me your hand.

613
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:42,798
Give me your hand.

614
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,708
Are you studying typewriting?

615
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,384
Am l a tree to climb?

616
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,976
Egg roast ready.
Bulls-eye ready.

617
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,082
Paappi.

618
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,185
Come one by one.

619
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,426
Have you given this in my hand
for sending me in jail?

620
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,763
My mother. Unexpected fighting.
l can't walk.

621
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:02,605
They won't know father has trained him
Kalari & Karate instead of egg & milk for Paappi

622
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:03,609
Go.

623
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,015
lf they were here for some more time,
then l would have died.

624
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,508
Paappi, who are those people.

625
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,288
This is his people.
Shashankan's.

626
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:17,624
Let me win in this election.
The first cracker will break in his face.

627
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,957
You have come back after
listening that. Useless.

628
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,792
That l..
- What?

629
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,801
He hadn't said that in front of us.
We heard all these from villagers.

630
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,531
Oh, if it was in front of you,
then you should have done something.

631
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:36,145
When you hear the name Paappi,
you will pee. Useless fellow.

632
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,638
Who are those people who
thrashed him after coming here?

633
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:02,000
The announcement of village council election
result of 9th ward in lttirikandam village.

634
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:05,508
Ambujaskan who contested
with the symbol of pillow and..

635
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:09,677
..Prabhakaran who contest with
the symbol of net was defeated.

636
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:16,015
Paappi who contested with the
symbol flower sparkle was..

637
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,952
..defeated to opposite contestant
Annie Varghese for 16 votes.

638
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,355
Congratulations.
- Don't burst crackers.

639
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,691
Jesus. My money is gone.

640
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,535
Now, climbing tree is best for you.

641
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,942
Mr. Mathai. How you are
seeing this defeat?

642
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:42,043
l am seeing it like this.
How you are seeing?

643
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:56,783
You go fool.

644
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,051
Your father is a fool. Go.

645
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,229
lf you call me fool, then l will raise again.

646
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,398
No father. Cool down. Cool down.

647
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,688
Cock is whooping.
Mother's..

648
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,326
Hello. We are participating
in Paappi's sorrow.

649
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:39,929
When is body to be taken?

650
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,602
No need to take.
He will get up after sometime.

651
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,371
We are celebrating the sorrow of defeat.
l will call you back.

652
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,775
The counting people might
have mistaken.

653
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:56,282
Even counting people were mistaken,
the people won't be mistaken.

654
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,885
People are talking like that.

655
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,719
l lost my fame.

656
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:05,622
Paappi, you don't worry.
You are in the second place.

657
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,794
Where is second place
in election, fool?

658
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:11,126
Box. Box. Ballet box.

659
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,461
Paappi had failed when the
box was opened.

660
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,797
Paappi had failed when the
box was opened.

661
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,133
ln ninth standard too, Paappi failed.

662
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:20,476
l can't see. Move aside.

663
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:24,909
ln ninth ward too, Paappi failed.
- ln ninth ward too, Paappi failed.

664
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:29,313
Narapal Paappi is in road.
- Narapal Paappi is in road.

665
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,149
When Paappi failed, crackers were burst.
- When Paappi failed, crackers were burst.

666
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:38,657
Paappi had failed when the box was opened.
- Paappi had failed when the box was opened.

667
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,490
Father, what happened?
- Father, what happened?

668
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:45,759
l slept here to see the
cracker bursting in the sky.

669
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,163
Burst in the land is not enough?

670
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,832
lt is a nightmare for Paappi.

671
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,166
What he said.

672
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:54,502
When result would announce he will
burst crackers in my face, right?

673
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:55,177
Then what happened?

674
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:58,673
l have burst crackers
in front of his house.

675
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,845
He might have been ashamed, right?
- Yes.

676
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,411
Teacher, listen.

677
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,783
lf Paappi and father have
some work in Panchayat,

678
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,686
then l will come in front of you, teacher.

679
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,090
When election is over, that is over.

680
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,457
Why should l show stubborn
in that matter?

681
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,797
Mother, did your fear over now?

682
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,265
What is there to fear now?
Now they will get feared.

683
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,374
l will play against them
with teacher.

684
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,443
Teacher, you be with us.
What you are saying?

685
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,142
No need of all that, Shashankan.

686
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,510
Shashankan has helped me
a lot for my success.

687
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,984
l am saying this not because
l have forgotten all that.

688
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:42,454
l have contested in the election not to
become a part of your personal rivalry.

689
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:46,217
l contested in the election for
doing good for this village.

690
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,329
For that, Paappi had become a reason.

691
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,328
That's all.

692
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:54,230
Don't put me into the persons
problems between you people.

693
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,565
lf something like that would happen,
then l will respond.

694
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:00,572
Oh! That means when you
crossed the bridge,

695
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,074
you are....discarding us, right?

696
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,238
l who spend money has
become a fool.

697
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,277
Annie teacher,

698
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,473
you don't know who this
Shashankan is.

699
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:08,582
Tell her.

700
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:13,916
My boss is a fool, rogue,
third rate and dirty fellow.

701
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,121
Stop it.

702
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:16,883
What happened here
to say like this?

703
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:21,095
Don't spoil this day by
saying something.

704
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,825
Teacher, why are you responding
like this to Shashankan?

705
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,863
We don't have to fight like this.

706
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,433
Shashankan, you eat
this Laddu (sweet).

707
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:30,901
No thanks.

708
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:31,869
My stomach is full.

709
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:32,769
Hey come.

710
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,944
Let's take some Laddu,
Our stomach is empty.

711
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:35,770
Go.

712
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,210
lf l spend money,
l know how to utilise that.

713
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,581
Today too, l have to drink rice soup.

714
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:49,114
NlRAPPEL MARKET

715
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,160
Manikunju Sir.

716
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:28,161
This Nerappal market is the
back bone of lttirikandam.

717
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,593
All the agricultural product
cultivated in this village would..

718
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,962
..firstly come to Nerappal market.

719
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,262
The people in Nerappal would
sell that in the town.

720
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:42,007
This is the custom of this
village for long time.

721
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:48,674
This market belongs to Radhakrishna Kaimal
who was the landlord at that time.

722
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,090
Kaimal was actually
the ruler of lttirikandam.

723
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,859
He was a spender.

724
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:04,557
That time Nerappal people had
expanded their business here.

725
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:05,860
What to say more?

726
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,765
Whatever Kaimal sold had come
in Nerappal people's hand.

727
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,133
People are saying that they
had secured everything.

728
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:16,377
When Kaimal lost his wealth,
he had run away from here.

729
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:22,013
His wife and son have
to leave the house.

730
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,345
After that there is no information
about them.

731
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,191
Look.
That is Nerappal Mathai.

732
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:32,691
The person who is dealing
with money is Paappi.

733
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,796
Villagers trust Nerappal people.

734
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,399
Even if it is two weeks late,
they will give them money.

735
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:43,130
Here anyone can do business.

736
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,104
They have to give 2% of the
profit for Nerappal people.

737
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,038
But all merchants are safe here.

738
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,906
So, l am having a doubt that
the matter which Manikinju sir is...

739
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,006
... planning would work out here.
Then too, l will try.

740
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,013
You know,

741
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,743
if they comes to know about this
then l will lose my head.

742
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,083
Okay.

743
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:07,763
We are cultivating for our livelihood.
We can't trust an outsider.

744
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,831
Paappi and his father won't cheat us.
Then what is the problem.

745
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,366
Till now they have done
everything properly,

746
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,504
even if we think something like that,
then it would be dishonesty.

747
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,669
Manikunju sir.
No one is agreeing.

748
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,808
They told me not to come
with this offer.

749
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:24,173
They won't sell goods to anyone
except that father and son.

750
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,491
Hey, keep the vehicle aside.

751
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,923
Otherwise Mani would think that
we have come for fighting.

752
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,061
Hey, keep aside.

753
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,961
ls it enough?
- Mani, it's not possible, lt's not possible.

754
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:44,430
l have tried a lot.

755
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:45,862
lf something should work out
in this place,

756
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,536
then that father and son should
be destroyed.- Yes.

757
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,671
You have to extract them from root.

758
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:52,307
Otherwise, nothing will work out
in lttirikandam.

759
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,304
Otherwise, l would become
the king of this place.

760
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:54,977
Yes.

761
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,543
lf Paappi and his father wouldn't be here,

762
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,941
then my boss would be the
real boss here.

763
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,081
Right, boss?

764
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,551
l am Shashankan boss.

765
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,482
l am also trying to fix
my root here like you.

766
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,257
Anyway, you have shown the
courage to go to tiger's den.

767
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,392
l liked that.

768
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,152
That's why l came here to meet you.

769
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,727
What is not there to capture,
if we stand together.

770
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:20,897
Nice.

771
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:22,736
He is the well suited person.

772
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,928
He takes time to befriend with me.

773
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,630
Then too he is the apt person.

774
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,400
A person like him should be needed to
suppress that father and son.

775
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:28,670
Father.

776
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,243
President is coming.

777
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:31,772
Where is mother?

778
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,347
Mother has gone with brother
to see eye specialist.

779
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:37,252
Does Paappi's eye get damaged
by seeing omen?

780
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,187
He has shown to show mother.

781
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,521
What will l do now?

782
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,924
Are you fine?
l am fine.

783
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:50,929
What happened?

784
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:55,298
l am born as the father of Paappi,
that why l have given side to him.

785
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,201
lf l was born as your father,
l would be with you.

786
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,876
l was happened because
of my situation.

787
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,977
lf l come to the village
council for something,

788
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,443
you won't kick me here
and there like a ball.

789
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,846
Let me think.
- Enough.

790
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,848
You think about it when you are free.

791
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,247
Don't think about it always.

792
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:15,288
Sister, how Paappi see omen,
if you are not going to school?

793
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,722
Does he come and stand
in front of village council office?

794
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:20,418
No. l haven't seen him after that.

795
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,997
Every day morning when
l go out of the house,

796
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,031
l used to see his jeep in the road.

797
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:28,602
One day when l heard a sound
and looked outside,

798
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:31,035
l have seen him running
near the mango tree.

799
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,299
l have just seen him.

800
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,976
His tail was also along
with him that time.

801
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,741
Mollykutty, what madness Paappi is doing?

802
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:39,813
Who knows? Not only that.
One more madness is there.

803
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,313
Come.
l will show you.

804
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,585
This is Paappi's room, right?
- Yes.

805
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,685
Does anyone say that the girl in that photo

806
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:51,588
would become village council president.

807
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:55,321
But Paappichayan would look at you
where ever he stands.

808
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,392
See this.
- What is this?

809
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:03,504
This is the lttirikandam village
which Paappi brother designed.

810
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:22,115
When all these happened?
- Sister, it is full comedy.

811
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:23,724
lf my brother would have won,
then he would change

812
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:25,394
the entire lttirikandam village.

813
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:29,554
He has written about each
and every place.

814
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,599
When l get bored, if l don't get
Boban and Molly magazine,

815
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,270
l used to read this and laugh.

816
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,296
This is not fun.

817
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,906
He has written this seriously.
- Yes.

818
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:40,234
That is fun.

819
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,673
After writing all this, he has defeated.

820
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:45,040
He can't make all villagers fool.

821
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,405
Shall l take this?
- Oh, yes.

822
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,710
lf it is kept here, after some time
we will sell this along with scraps.

823
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,652
Don't tell Paappi about this.

824
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:10,069
Person without education.

825
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,672
He is not like what l thought about him.

826
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,435
Paappi... Paappi...

827
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:16,639
What happened?

828
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:20,509
An outsider is taking goods from
our market at higher price.

829
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,015
That Gopalan and Paili
are supporting him.

830
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:24,948
They are planning to destroy
our business.

831
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:29,924
Paappi

832
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,257
Take one more.

833
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,698
Paappi has come.
- What?

834
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,092
Paappi has come.

835
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,571
Let's handover Paappi to
Manikunju this time.

836
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:46,764
Let him play.

837
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:01,454
What happened, Gopalan?

838
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,389
Gopalan and Paili have
given side to that sir

839
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:11,461
who had given you more
money than us, right?

840
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:16,962
You have the right to decide for whom
you have to sell the products.

841
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,068
l am agreeing to that.

842
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,469
But you have to do that
out of this market.

843
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,905
Paappi, what you are saying?

844
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:26,605
You have taken our products but you
haven't given any advance for that, right?

845
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,182
Earlier itself, it was like
that, Right Gopalan?

846
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,444
We used to give the price
of your products

847
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:32,746
after selling that in
the market, right?

848
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:33,922
Now, what happened?

849
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:37,456
We will sell out products
to who we like.

850
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,491
How much rent do you need
for keeping all this here?

851
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,721
lf you want to give rent for us,

852
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,331
then you have to sell
your house, Paili.

853
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,869
Now, we are in need of money.

854
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,595
A person is ready to give us
money at this moment,

855
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:50,670
that's why we sold it to him.

856
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:57,780
l have kept an account of money you have
taken from us when it was necessary.

857
01:01:58,314 --> 01:01:59,747
Leave that.

858
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:06,184
Whatever goods you have loaded from
here should be unloaded now itself.

859
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:16,021
lf anyone among you is stubborn that
you will take then you can take.

860
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,369
Sir, Paappi is not agreeing.

861
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,198
We have loaded the goods
as you said.

862
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,806
You do the remaining.
That's our contract.

863
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,408
lf that is not possible,
then take this money back.

864
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,473
We have to live here.

865
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:46,719
Take the vehicle.

866
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,842
Jesus.

867
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,422
Hey, are you become tired
after saying big dialogue?

868
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,354
l fell down.

869
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,152
But it's very nice to sleep like this.

870
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,092
Go thrash them without losing
Nerappal Mathai's name.

871
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:31,624
Then brother-in-law gave me your hand.

872
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,825
Brother-in-law?
l am your father.

873
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,663
Father, give me your hand.

874
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,491
Where are you going?
Come here.

875
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,202
Paappi.

876
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,865
What is going on here?
What is going on here?

877
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,796
Everybody go away from here.
Go away.

878
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,128
Haven't you heard?

879
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,467
lf you have any problem,
you report in the police station.

880
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:58,765
We know what to do.

881
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:01,374
Go away from here.
Go. Go.

882
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:10,051
Manikunju, don't try to shine here
by listening to Gopalan and Paili.

883
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:15,953
Paappi and his father made this
market like this by hard working.

884
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,752
The villagers have gratitude for that.

885
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:22,392
They don't seduce by others.

886
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,897
This is not the field for you
to cultivate, Manikunju.

887
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,000
Go. Go.

888
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:35,139
Take.

889
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:47,255
Poor Manikunju.
He got backfire from you.

890
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:52,518
He has tried to train P.T. Usha
how to run.

891
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:56,255
l got the luck to be born as his father.

892
01:08:56,665 --> 01:09:00,101
You are extraordinary.
- Yes.

893
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:04,773
ls there anymore seed?
- Yes.

894
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:10,002
lf there is space, then we can grow.
ls there any space?

895
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:17,448
Paappi, do you like this
father or your mother?

896
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:19,921
What a question is this, Beeran?

897
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,647
That is one and a half question.

898
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,456
Right, Paappi?

899
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,785
Father.

900
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:34,800
Paappi, whom you like more,
father or mother?

901
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,801
Father.

902
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,262
Father.

903
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:39,498
Father.

904
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,300
Father.

905
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,155
" Paappi.''

906
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:00,692
" Father.''

907
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:03,189
" Paappi.''

908
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:05,424
" Father.''

909
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:07,693
" Oh, Paappi.''

910
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,871
" Father.''

911
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:12,267
" Oh, Paappi.''

912
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:14,999
" Father.''

913
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,974
" Father, dust, wind and
liquor is there.''

914
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:19,579
" Holy spirit.''

915
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:24,219
" lt beats, it breaks.''
"Small duck.''

916
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,548
" Dinner in the night.''

917
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:32,620
" lf curry is there, liquor too is good.''

918
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:14,702
" When we went to Kunnel church
for praying..''

919
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:18,930
" You have carried me
like a holy cross.''

920
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:24,035
" When l fell from the papaya tree
after drinking liquor..''

921
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:28,410
" That time l sat on your shoulder, Father.''

922
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:33,214
" Don't advice me.''
"Don't show formality.''

923
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:38,189
" Don't show your scare.''
"This won't go.''

924
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:41,261
" Pour this pure liquor.''

925
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:45,957
" Pour this pure liquor.''

926
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:51,972
" Hey, Syrian Christian,
don't die by drinking this.''

927
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:55,268
" We have to go to church for festival.''

928
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:59,370
" Don't say anything by
seeing nonsense.''

929
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,977
" Don't respond to injustice.''

930
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:56,495
" Climb the mountain by
seeing the elephant..''

931
01:12:56,705 --> 01:13:01,005
" ..like a small pumpkin.''

932
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,647
" Offer small bead like pepper.''

933
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:09,682
" Becomes shelter for sister.''

934
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:15,156
" l told you several times not to
say this old story, Father.''

935
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,847
" Don't crawl, my son.''

936
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,755
" l understood your change of tone.''

937
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:22,897
" Pour this pure liquor.''

938
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,535
" Pour this pure liquor.''

939
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:33,641
" lf mother comes to know,
then we won't get dinner''

940
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:37,869
" For villagers also we will
become a burden, my son.''

941
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,040
" Don't say anything by
seeing nonsense.''

942
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:46,044
" Don't respond to injustice.''

943
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,117
" Paappi.''

944
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,726
" Father.''

945
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:53,889
" Oh, Paappi.''

946
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,724
" Father.''

947
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:58,729
" Father, dust, wind and
liquor is there.''

948
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:01,334
" Holy spirit.''

949
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:05,906
" lt beats, it breaks.''
"small duck.''

950
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:09,339
" Dinner in the night.''

951
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:14,408
" lf curry is there, liquor too is good.''

952
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,929
Enough.
- l too finished.

953
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,610
lttirikandam village should surprise by
seeing this year's school anniversary.

954
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,278
Everything should be done properly.

955
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:46,812
What is this?

956
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:48,209
l told you to do everything properly.

957
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:49,645
Before that itself everything
is inadequate, right?

958
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:50,944
l haven't done anything.

959
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,953
" Forest man.''

960
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,385
Teacher, what is this?
- What?

961
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:57,991
lf there is any scarcity,
then you tell me.

962
01:14:58,193 --> 01:14:59,057
Why are you making children say it?

963
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:00,523
l haven't mentioned anything
about inadequacy.

964
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,627
Then why children are
saying it is less.

965
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,662
What is not there for you?
Tell me.

966
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,230
Paappi, that is a song.

967
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:11,303
" Forest man.''

968
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:15,136
" Forest man staying in Elamanikad.''

969
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,470
" Elamanikad.''

970
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:18,972
lf motion is less, then go
and consult a doctor.

971
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:21,182
See you.
- Okay.

972
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,144
Paappi, your would-be is coming.

973
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,144
When did she come?

974
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,583
This is teacher's school,
so, she can come at anytime.

975
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,312
You are seeing her after
so many days.

976
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,923
Remove your spectacles.

977
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,685
Otherwise she will break that.
- Yes.

978
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:35,159
You can't change your dress.

979
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,924
What to say?
- Let's order for two teas and snacks.

980
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:40,196
When two people meet,
then what to say.

981
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:41,426
Walk properly.
- What?

982
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:43,662
We used to say that when
two people collide each other.

983
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,768
What to say like saying
good morning?

984
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,772
As per your status,
you can say good morning.

985
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:49,636
You wish me.

986
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:51,176
Take care.
- Good morning.

987
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:53,273
Show a little muscle.

988
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,812
She is the village council
President, so you say hello.

989
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:57,417
Yes. That's good.
Hello.

990
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:00,053
But good morning is nice.
- Then good morning.

991
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:02,786
Hello is new style, it is suited.

992
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,626
Keep quiet.
l know what to say.

993
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:08,329
Gumasthay.

994
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,827
Teased me, right?
- No.

995
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,732
ls it because of the anger that
l have become President?

996
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,140
When l saw immediately,

997
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,469
then Good morning and
hello came together.

998
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:25,036
l told you don't say anything, right?

999
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:30,383
Very nice.
- Teacher is eating that much food.

1000
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,447
Go and take my phone from the jeep.

1001
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:33,643
Take Paappi's phone.

1002
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,652
You keep it in the vehicle.
Then stand there.

1003
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:37,347
Why?

1004
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,322
lf someone calls in this,
then who will pick it.

1005
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,826
l can do that here also.
- Are you back-answering me?

1006
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,497
lf no one calls in this,
you call someone.

1007
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:44,324
Go.

1008
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,328
You are doing your duty nicely.

1009
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:55,976
Whatever l thought in my mind,
Annie is doing all that nicely.

1010
01:16:56,178 --> 01:17:01,013
By seeing all that, my sorrow due
to the failure in election was over.

1011
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,911
For that, l have to say
thanks to Paappi.

1012
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:05,212
What for?

1013
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:09,083
For making me, who would have failed
after winning the election, successful.

1014
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,183
l didn't understand.

1015
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,385
Paappi's this dairy is my text book.

1016
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:16,188
l have taken it from your house
without Paappi's permission.

1017
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:17,023
Sorry.

1018
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:18,529
You know painting very well, right?

1019
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,226
Little bit.
- l haven't copied fully.

1020
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:24,769
l have made little changes.

1021
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,107
One doubt.

1022
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,208
You have written that the
river through Chandran's land

1023
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,503
hould be reverted to west, right?

1024
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:34,614
But that... there..

1025
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:36,479
Here.

1026
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:01,973
Right?

1027
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:04,303
Yes. Yes.

1028
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:10,581
For this, you have sent me back.

1029
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,175
Not that.

1030
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,950
lf the work of this
hanging bridge gets over..

1031
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:14,986
Teacher.

1032
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,590
Teacher's mother called me when she
didn't get you on the phone.

1033
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:18,987
They have come to see you.

1034
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:21,262
Time is gone. May l go?

1035
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,859
This is the problem of the
village council president.

1036
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,696
People would be always
there in the house.

1037
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,929
Wants to make toilet, bath room..

1038
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:33,005
This is not that.
- Then?

1039
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,698
They have come to see her
for marriage.

1040
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,673
Oh! lt's nice.

1041
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:43,150
l am having the fear that the church
festival and marriage would mix up.

1042
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:44,340
Yes, Suma.

1043
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:46,716
What to say?

1044
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,584
l wasn't tensed this much
when l contested elections.

1045
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:53,227
l was shivering when l stand
in front of the groom.

1046
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:54,154
No. no.

1047
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:55,124
They haven't gone.

1048
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:59,064
The boy is not bad.
He is not looking problematic.

1049
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,471
Suma, l will call you back.

1050
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:27,227
Mary.

1051
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:29,794
My banana.

1052
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:32,125
Hey, show your face and go.

1053
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:36,236
What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

1054
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:38,570
My name is Tony.
Tony lssac.

1055
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,140
You told me earlier.

1056
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,311
Then too, l have to say something to you.

1057
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:46,572
Because talking with the bride
is a custom nowadays.

1058
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:50,409
l studied engineering.
But now, l am doing a small business.

1059
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,517
Food exporting.

1060
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:53,479
You are Annie.
You were a school teacher.

1061
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:54,712
Now, village council President.

1062
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:56,447
That's all, right?
Simple.

1063
01:19:56,658 --> 01:20:01,118
l... marriage soon.

1064
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:04,832
You know about my responsibility, right?

1065
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,092
Marriage is not conducting tomorrow.

1066
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:09,026
Take your own time.

1067
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,831
When my mother saw your
photograph, she liked you.

1068
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,372
lf my mother says,
l don't think more.

1069
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:16,438
So, you think nicely.

1070
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,474
l am expecting a positive reply.

1071
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,815
Hello.
- l am Tony's mother.

1072
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,586
Mother, tell me.

1073
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:30,985
Who is your mother?

1074
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:35,524
Why are you talking like this?

1075
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,426
l am not getting you.
- Lousy woman.

1076
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,066
l will make you understand.

1077
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:41,963
Who is Nerappal Paappi of yours?

1078
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:44,631
What is the relationship between you?

1079
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,665
Hey, if he is having affair with you,

1080
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,639
then why are you putting
us in trouble?

1081
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,779
Hey, mind your tongue.

1082
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,174
What do you think?
After having affair with someone

1083
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:55,815
and conduct marriage
to a wealthy family?

1084
01:20:56,618 --> 01:21:00,748
He can't open his eyes, if he
won't see you in the morning.

1085
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:03,186
He has thrashed my son.

1086
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:03,948
Hello.

1087
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,626
You are speaking without
knowing anything.

1088
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:08,227
Whatever we came to know,
that's enough.

1089
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,022
Soon after seeing the bride,
you are behaving like this.

1090
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,963
l am thankful to you for showing
your real behaviour before marriage.

1091
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:17,605
My father hadn't taught me to speak
in a dirty language like this.

1092
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,330
So, l am not giving any reply to you.

1093
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:23,773
l heard what your father had taught you.

1094
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:27,142
Your lover told me that villagers
would say the remaining..

1095
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:29,783
You have lived worse there..

1096
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,252
Who was that?

1097
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:35,146
What is the matter, dear?

1098
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,602
Dear.

1099
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:50,566
Annie.

1100
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:52,530
Annie, open the door.

1101
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:54,631
Annie.

1102
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:35,509
Sister, why did you come so early?
What is the matter?

1103
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:39,409
l have come here to see the people
who make problems here.

1104
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:40,588
Where is your brother?

1105
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,189
He has gone to the town with goods.

1106
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,859
Right, Father?
- Yes.

1107
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:48,755
Dear, what is the matter?
- Problem is not for me.

1108
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:49,931
You son is having problem.

1109
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:55,600
Tell him don't play with Annie.

1110
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:56,930
What he is thinking about himself?

1111
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:59,299
l haven't told anyone to interfere
in my matters.

1112
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:01,907
What is the matter?
- You should be blamed first.

1113
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,102
lf lot of money is there,
then pride would also be there.

1114
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:09,147
The life of poor people like us
would be silly for you.

1115
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,942
God has decided everything.
Remember that.

1116
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:18,748
Dear, tell me clearly.
We didn't understand anything.

1117
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,723
l will make you understand.
Listen.

1118
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:24,126
Your son had rejected
my marriage proposal.

1119
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:26,629
My Jesus.

1120
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,633
He hadn'tjust cancelled.

1121
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:35,469
He had beaten the groom
after going to his house.

1122
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:37,642
What you are saying?

1123
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,143
Paappi won't do anything like that.

1124
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,474
Whatever he does, he would tell me.

1125
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,844
Your son has become like
this because of you.

1126
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,520
Does any father in the world
serve liquor to his son?

1127
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:48,086
Would they drink and
dance with them?

1128
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:50,990
A father who gives side for him
to do all nonsense.

1129
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:52,784
Dear, you tell whatever
you want to tell.

1130
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:55,292
You have the right for that.

1131
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,521
But this..

1132
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:57,993
Wait and see.

1133
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,999
You will suffer because of the
way you brought up your son.

1134
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:03,767
You will cry heartbroken.

1135
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:08,041
My poor mother.

1136
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:13,442
lf she cursed him in mind,
all this will burn.

1137
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,186
Here also one girl is there.

1138
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:21,054
When her marriage would
cancel because of his

1139
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:22,723
behaviour that time you come
to know about our situation.

1140
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:27,118
That time you would understand
my mother's sorrow.

1141
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:30,694
Remember that.

1142
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:35,299
The son who is friendly to you
would denounce you.

1143
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:38,137
Blame you.

1144
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,907
He may even kill you.

1145
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:44,801
That time only you would learn a lesson.

1146
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:47,977
l am saying this from broken heart.

1147
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:58,157
My Jesus.

1148
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:00,391
What all is he doing?

1149
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,758
Paappi won't do like that.

1150
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:15,373
l am wishing the students of this
school to become well known artists.

1151
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,044
l am briefing my speech.

1152
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:22,774
l am inviting village council
President and our favourite

1153
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:28,288
teacher Annie for inaugurating
this anniversary.

1154
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:31,785
Boss will give us too.
- Sure.

1155
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:39,456
The felicitated guest,
villagers and students.

1156
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:47,098
Move aside.

1157
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,936
l will make everything flop.

1158
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:52,042
Paappi.

1159
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:55,048
Leave me.

1160
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,616
Hey, what happened,
Pumpkin eyed girl? Black girl.

1161
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:04,721
Don't go there now.

1162
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:08,155
She had given a big speech
in front of my father.

1163
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:10,058
Now, she won't give speech here.
- Paappi, listen to me.

1164
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:12,233
Move aside.
- Please give side for my boss and me.

1165
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:16,728
Father. Paappi is here to question her.
Who are you?

1166
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:19,164
Show the power of village council
President to someone else.

1167
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:22,669
lf you come and shout at my
father and mother, l will Paappi, no.

1168
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:25,402
People are seeing.
No one came to know about this.

1169
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,174
Don't make us ashamed.

1170
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:29,646
She had made Paappi ashamed a lot.

1171
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:31,680
lt is Paappi's day today.
- Paappi.

1172
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:33,584
Go home.
- Paappi.

1173
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:35,422
Don't create any problem.

1174
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:37,587
Father, you mind your own business.

1175
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:41,991
You don't act too smart after
disgracing my father.

1176
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:43,421
What did you say?

1177
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:46,099
l have cancelled your
marriage, right? Yes.

1178
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:48,594
l have cancelled your marriage.

1179
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:55,939
l have beaten him.

1180
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:02,275
Paappi will block all the
proposals coming for you.

1181
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:04,610
What will you do?
Black buffalo.

1182
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:06,946
Hey. Mind your tongue.

1183
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:09,347
You are insulting a lady in public.

1184
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:12,023
Who are you to say that?
Move aside.

1185
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:15,686
Came to give her side.
Who are you?

1186
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,557
Useless.
- Stop it.

1187
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,624
What?
- This is a school.

1188
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:22,459
Don't do nonsense here.
Otherwise l will call the police.

1189
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:26,132
You show your power there.
ln village council office.

1190
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,908
She calls police.
Then you call.

1191
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:34,641
This is my place.
The school which l built.

1192
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:38,248
l will do anything here.
Who is there to block me?

1193
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:46,153
My Jesus.

1194
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:58,164
Get out from here.

1195
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:06,002
This is Nerappal Mathai's property.
The school which l built.

1196
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:11,007
Do you have any doubt?
Get out from here.

1197
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:14,953
Please take him. Son.

1198
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:19,924
When she came to our house
and told me, l didn't believe her.

1199
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:22,527
l argued that my son won't do that.

1200
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:24,095
Now, l understood everything.

1201
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:26,960
Don't come in front of me.
Go away from here.

1202
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:34,268
Son. No.
- Mother. No.

1203
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:38,377
Someone take him away.
- No, son.

1204
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:39,876
Take him.

1205
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:46,550
Hey, come here.

1206
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:49,050
Paappi.

1207
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:53,554
Son. Leave him.

1208
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:56,226
Leave him. Leave my son.

1209
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:04,672
Paappi, leave that.
He is your father, right?

1210
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,568
That is the problem.

1211
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:09,066
My father has beaten me
for the first time.

1212
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,177
That too, in front of so many people.

1213
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,240
l can't tolerate that.
l don't want to live.

1214
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:20,413
No one will tease for getting
slapped by your father.

1215
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:22,079
Not that, Sir.

1216
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:26,159
Wherever l fail.
Whatever happens..

1217
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:30,921
Then too my father hugs me
like this and consoles me.

1218
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:32,823
Leave it, son.

1219
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,029
l am here for you and
you are here for me.

1220
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:38,364
Then what is there for us to fear?

1221
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:41,432
And now..

1222
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:44,111
Without knowing what the matter is..

1223
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:47,273
Father beats me.

1224
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:55,556
For me, no one is there, Sir.
l lost everything.

1225
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:04,187
What happened?

1226
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:09,798
Paappi. Our school caught fire.
lt's burning.

1227
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:34,819
Pour water.

1228
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:37,263
What are you looking at?

1229
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:39,694
Don't you see that it's is burning?

1230
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:41,993
Go and get water.

1231
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:44,267
Fast.

1232
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:48,236
What happened, Gopalan?

1233
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,671
Why are you standing like this?

1234
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:51,504
Why are you not trying
to stop the fire?

1235
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,347
Sir.
Who has done this?

1236
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:59,250
Where is my father?
l want to see him.

1237
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,944
He won't tolerate this.

1238
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:01,985
Where is my father?

1239
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:02,849
Stop it.

1240
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,359
His drama.

1241
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:08,358
What do you think?

1242
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:11,655
You have been using started this
burning drama for a long time.

1243
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:15,858
Do you want to show revenge of your father
by taking the lives of the students

1244
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:21,974
Master. Master.
Don't believe this.

1245
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:22,870
lt's a lie.

1246
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:25,045
Don't believe what he says.

1247
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:29,541
We never thought that a devil like
this was there in your mind.

1248
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:31,650
Paappi, now you don't try
to give say any excuse.

1249
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:33,218
Your sordid bastard
character has come out.

1250
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:38,425
Hey, if you say something to my
father, then l will kill you.

1251
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:39,318
Rogue.

1252
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,387
You will do that.

1253
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:42,790
You have tried to kill your father.

1254
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:44,225
Then what about the others?

1255
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,134
Father.

1256
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:57,174
Father.

1257
01:31:58,279 --> 01:31:59,268
What happened to you, father?

1258
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,276
Mother.

1259
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:02,743
Did you hear what Shashankan said?

1260
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:05,282
Father you have beaten me up,
but that is nothing for this Paappi.

1261
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:07,078
Father, you open your eyes.

1262
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:09,313
lf one school is burnt,
then we will build 100 schools.

1263
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,151
That is our habit.

1264
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:12,883
These people are jealousy, father.

1265
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:15,085
Father.

1266
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:19,255
The son who is friendly to you
would denounce you.

1267
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:21,931
He may even kill you.

1268
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:24,969
Father.
- Take your hand, you dog.

1269
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,369
Did you come here to
see my dead body?

1270
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:36,845
You are playing against
me now, right?

1271
01:32:37,985 --> 01:32:39,384
What are you saying father?

1272
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:41,651
Now onwards you don't call me father.

1273
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,619
You don't have the right for that.

1274
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:46,625
Father.
- Phew.

1275
01:32:47,461 --> 01:32:48,450
Your father is dead.

1276
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:50,790
Jesus. What are you saying?
- You keep quite.

1277
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:55,564
The son who was like a friend for his father
and that same son has killed the father.

1278
01:32:55,937 --> 01:32:58,337
This is Mathai, Nerappal Mathai.

1279
01:32:58,539 --> 01:32:59,801
You can call me like that.

1280
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:03,772
Are you saying all this by hearing to this
dirty fellow who wants to see our downfall?

1281
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:05,741
lf he wasn't there, then nothing
would have been here now.

1282
01:33:05,947 --> 01:33:08,507
He has shown the love which my
own son never didn't have.

1283
01:33:08,716 --> 01:33:12,243
lf he wouldn't have saved me, then Mathai
would have now burned into ashes.

1284
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:14,945
You are mad.
- Yes.

1285
01:33:15,156 --> 01:33:18,990
Now l understood that loving children
beneath the limit is madness.

1286
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,553
Now l decided to remove
that madness.

1287
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:25,596
l removed your name from
the ration card of Nerappal house.

1288
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:33,035
Now onwards, you are just Paappi.

1289
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,373
Paappi without any address.

1290
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:43,575
l don't have a son like this.

1291
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:46,446
You also think that your father is dead.

1292
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:53,022
Yes.

1293
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,563
My father is dead.

1294
01:33:56,764 --> 01:33:58,095
My father won't speak like this.

1295
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:01,427
Then why are you standing in Nerappal
Mathai's property without any shame.

1296
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:02,568
Get out from here.

1297
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:03,259
Shashankan.
- Yes.

1298
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:04,631
Take him from here.
- Oh, yes.

1299
01:34:04,839 --> 01:34:05,863
Don't touch me.

1300
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:10,032
You or your father can't
touch even Paappi's hair.

1301
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:11,869
l am going.

1302
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:14,570
Don't think that Paappi has failed.
l don't want to fail.

1303
01:34:14,782 --> 01:34:17,751
Men must show their strength
not in talking but through courage.

1304
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:21,080
lf you have courage,
you better show that.

1305
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:25,247
Live a life without touching
anything which Mathai has made.

1306
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:27,450
Mathai hasn't made anything alone.

1307
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,256
Father and son have
together made all these.

1308
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:33,190
lf you want to do everything alone,
then let's see who win.

1309
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:35,561
Father or son.
- You're mistaken.

1310
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:37,033
Not between father and son now.

1311
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:40,173
The war is between
Nerappal Mathai and Paappi.

1312
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:43,571
You try if you can
compete with Mathai.

1313
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,438
Then give me shake
my hand, brother-in-law.

1314
01:34:46,647 --> 01:34:47,841
Get out from here.

1315
01:34:51,652 --> 01:34:52,277
Come.

1316
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:59,489
NlRAPPEL PAAPPl V/S NlRAPPEL MATHAl

1317
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:02,993
''JUST'' PAAPPl V/S NlRAPPEL MATHAl

1318
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,707
Father, is it due to the
after effect of Saturn?

1319
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:28,711
This is not because of Saturn.

1320
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:31,323
Now onwards,
it is Shashankan's time.

1321
01:35:31,525 --> 01:35:33,789
The backbone of Nerappal
house has collapsed.

1322
01:35:33,994 --> 01:35:37,623
lnstead of Paappi, l became
the right hand of Mathai.

1323
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:41,131
l will separate father and son forever.

1324
01:35:41,335 --> 01:35:44,133
Both of them have played
a lot with me.

1325
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:49,974
Hello.

1326
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:57,384
Give it back. Give it back.

1327
01:35:57,585 --> 01:36:01,180
Give back our money.

1328
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:04,155
Hey give us our money.
Give it..

1329
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:06,720
Hey. This plan has worked out.

1330
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:08,360
Stop it.

1331
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:11,195
Don't say any excuse.
Give our money.

1332
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:12,922
Let me enquire what is the problem?

1333
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:14,863
Who are you to enquire? CBl?

1334
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:21,169
What is going on here?

1335
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:22,672
Did the manager run away
from here with the money?

1336
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:25,107
l am the manager.
- Then what is this?

1337
01:36:25,312 --> 01:36:28,304
ln the morning, when the office was opened,
some people came and withdrew the money.

1338
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:29,881
l didn't feel anything wrong in that.

1339
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:31,881
After that, lots of people
started coming.

1340
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:33,246
l told them that there is no money.

1341
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:34,944
Since then they have started this.

1342
01:36:35,156 --> 01:36:35,622
Boss.

1343
01:36:35,823 --> 01:36:38,951
Someone has given publicity that
our chit company has collapsed.

1344
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,151
l know that who has done that.

1345
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:45,025
lf the snake has died, then the
sacred Ghee varghese has killed it.

1346
01:36:45,232 --> 01:36:46,529
Playing with Mathai.

1347
01:36:48,002 --> 01:36:49,196
How much money is there
in the bank?

1348
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:50,665
Not much is there.

1349
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:52,805
The entire amount is invested
in other businesses.

1350
01:36:54,608 --> 01:36:56,633
You give me some paper.
- What paper?

1351
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:59,540
Keep some plain paper
in a file and give me.

1352
01:37:02,783 --> 01:37:03,977
Stop.

1353
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:05,975
Don't make noise.

1354
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:08,246
Let me speak.
- You don't say anything.

1355
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:09,046
Give our money back.

1356
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:10,723
You say something after
giving our money back.

1357
01:37:17,932 --> 01:37:19,126
Are you coming now?

1358
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,163
Go fast and ask.

1359
01:37:20,367 --> 01:37:21,391
Go fast.

1360
01:37:21,802 --> 01:37:24,771
This chit company belongs to the
people in lttirikandam village.

1361
01:37:25,105 --> 01:37:27,164
Your money is safe here.

1362
01:37:27,374 --> 01:37:29,274
lf it is safe here,
then you show us money.

1363
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:30,773
Without giving spiritual talk.

1364
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:34,571
You are the son of that
Puthiya Padathai Joy, right?

1365
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:36,147
Who has gone to Dubai, right?

1366
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,841
You don't have chit here.
- l don't have.

1367
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:41,021
But he possess, he is a dumb.

1368
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:43,247
That's why l came here to talk for him.

1369
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,084
Mathai, give us our money
without wasting time.

1370
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:48,192
Yes.

1371
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,094
Give us our money back.

1372
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:51,797
Give them their money.

1373
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:55,196
l will give you the money.
But give me a little time.

1374
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:57,370
You all know me.

1375
01:37:57,571 --> 01:37:59,300
l won't run away from here.

1376
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:04,102
lf you make noise here, then you won't
get your money at this moment.

1377
01:38:04,311 --> 01:38:13,447
Because l have registered this chit company
in the name of Paappi who was with me earlier.

1378
01:38:16,757 --> 01:38:20,420
lf you have any doubts, then you
can check these documents.

1379
01:38:20,628 --> 01:38:21,458
What documents?

1380
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:26,190
Your money is invested in his
name in the bank account.

1381
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,628
When?

1382
01:38:27,835 --> 01:38:30,998
l need time to find him and
get that money back.

1383
01:38:31,205 --> 01:38:32,365
That's what l am asking you for.

1384
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:35,974
lf you find him, then you
bring him in front of me.

1385
01:38:36,176 --> 01:38:37,643
l will get your money from him.

1386
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:39,913
Escape.

1387
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:43,081
One salted soda.

1388
01:38:47,855 --> 01:38:49,516
Put little more salt.

1389
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:53,717
He is having a little
more intelligence.

1390
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:57,659
Paappi came to know that father's chit
company has collapsed, he'll be overwhelmed.

1391
01:38:58,132 --> 01:38:59,497
That's why he decided to drink
one salted soda.

1392
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,167
His overwhelm will increase more.

1393
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:03,768
lt's better to start
a soda company.

1394
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:06,268
Shashankan, take the vehicle.
- Oh!

1395
01:39:14,315 --> 01:39:15,509
Father, get in.

1396
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:17,775
Father?
When onwards?

1397
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,527
Put some more rice balls.
He likes that very much.

1398
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,561
Put in this umbrella.

1399
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:32,959
Let father don't see this.

1400
01:39:35,736 --> 01:39:36,361
Come.

1401
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:41,037
Catch that without showing him.

1402
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:43,908
He is coming.

1403
01:39:45,612 --> 01:39:46,544
Hide that.

1404
01:39:49,683 --> 01:39:51,150
Where mother and
daughter are going?

1405
01:39:51,352 --> 01:39:53,013
To see the doctor.

1406
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:55,211
What happened?
ls that umbrella pregnant?

1407
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:57,752
Who is behind that?

1408
01:39:58,692 --> 01:40:01,661
The umbrella is bulged.
That's why l asked.

1409
01:40:01,862 --> 01:40:03,591
What is in that, Mollykutty?

1410
01:40:03,864 --> 01:40:05,092
Nothing father.

1411
01:40:05,299 --> 01:40:08,996
lf there is nothing, then you
raise that umbrella. Right?

1412
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:12,938
Some sweets for Paappi
are there in that.

1413
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:16,570
Mollykutty, open that.

1414
01:40:16,877 --> 01:40:19,402
Then put that in the plate of cow.

1415
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:21,280
Father, that..

1416
01:40:21,548 --> 01:40:23,015
Put that.

1417
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:28,782
Mix it.

1418
01:40:36,063 --> 01:40:40,022
lf you want to see him, then you
remove that wish from our mind.

1419
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:43,635
lf anyone goes from
here to see him...

1420
01:40:44,405 --> 01:40:48,535
Go inside. Go inside.
Go. Go. Go inside.

1421
01:40:56,817 --> 01:41:01,049
Nutritious food in time.
Lots of dresses.

1422
01:41:01,255 --> 01:41:04,884
Money. How l have lived.

1423
01:41:05,092 --> 01:41:06,218
Who?
- l.

1424
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:07,894
Father and son have
destroyed everything.

1425
01:41:08,429 --> 01:41:11,057
Then you go there.
You don't discard anything for me.

1426
01:41:11,265 --> 01:41:12,892
l haven't told you all this for
making you disappointed.

1427
01:41:13,267 --> 01:41:16,327
l have told this by thinking that l will
also destroy because of Paappi's company.

1428
01:41:16,537 --> 01:41:18,801
His...You don't destroy like that.

1429
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:23,235
You see Paappi's play from now onwards.
- l haved seen your play.

1430
01:41:23,444 --> 01:41:25,071
What?
- Your father is very crooked.

1431
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:27,747
He has diverted the mind of people
with just plain paper.

1432
01:41:27,948 --> 01:41:30,917
People understood the truth,
that's why you escaped.

1433
01:41:32,786 --> 01:41:34,913
Paappi, when we go to play,

1434
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:39,582
we should realize that the opposite
team also knows to play very well.

1435
01:41:41,528 --> 01:41:43,428
Think that from where you will start.

1436
01:42:12,092 --> 01:42:12,786
Attack.

1437
01:42:12,993 --> 01:42:14,051
Attack.

1438
01:42:18,999 --> 01:42:22,298
" Even if it is a forest man,
then to l will cut you into pieces.''

1439
01:42:22,503 --> 01:42:24,971
" By locking the prey and
showing the tiger's den.''

1440
01:42:26,006 --> 01:42:27,564
" Don't try to threaten me.''

1441
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:29,298
''Don't try to evacuate me
by hitting with tin.''

1442
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:32,638
" l will fry you in a pot.''
-" Go man.''

1443
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:35,974
" l will hang and kill you.''
-" l will shout at you.''

1444
01:42:36,183 --> 01:42:39,482
" l will cut you like a thunder sword.''

1445
01:42:39,686 --> 01:42:43,144
" l will thrash and dump you.''
-" l will bury in fire.''

1446
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:46,815
" Even if your body is damaged.''

1447
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:18,178
" lf you come to fight,
you'll lose your teeth.''

1448
01:44:18,385 --> 01:44:22,014
" l will break your hand like rubber.''

1449
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:28,758
" l will set fire in the godown.''

1450
01:44:28,962 --> 01:44:32,193
" l will keep snakes in
the textile shop.''

1451
01:44:32,466 --> 01:44:35,765
" Don't make last supper
in the market..''

1452
01:44:35,902 --> 01:44:39,167
" Swing in the holy cross and enjoy.''

1453
01:44:39,373 --> 01:44:42,774
" Hey, silly boy.''
"Don't make your own trench.''

1454
01:44:42,976 --> 01:44:47,606
" Pala church will open
tomorrow for festival.''

1455
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:52,617
" l will put bitter seed in father's liquor.''

1456
01:44:52,819 --> 01:44:56,118
" You are just a fake snake.''
"Don't you play with me.''

1457
01:44:56,323 --> 01:44:59,952
" Go away from here without
before you get beaten.''

1458
01:45:21,448 --> 01:45:25,145
lttirikandam village is going
to become an English country.

1459
01:45:25,352 --> 01:45:30,255
Paappi is opening an English Medium
school from next academic year.

1460
01:45:30,457 --> 01:45:35,656
Let's listen what Lal says.

1461
01:45:36,029 --> 01:45:40,659
There was in a width of wall.
The dramatist must device a new world.

1462
01:45:40,867 --> 01:45:44,325
" A, e, i , o, u.''
"By learning the lesson.''

1463
01:45:44,538 --> 01:45:47,268
" And by teaching the lesson.''
"l will become a big person tomorrow.''

1464
01:45:47,474 --> 01:45:49,999
" Llisten, l will also become
a big person.''- Yes.

1465
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:53,668
We have to study English
for our betterment.

1466
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:56,610
lf we study English, then only we will
come to know about lndia well better,

1467
01:45:56,817 --> 01:46:01,845
Let's listen what our dear Mammootty
says about lndia in English.

1468
01:46:02,289 --> 01:46:05,190
For knowing that,
you should know what lndia is.

1469
01:46:05,392 --> 01:46:09,351
You should have the sense to know
the soul of great country lndia.

1470
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:12,358
You should have the sensibility.
You should have the sensitivity.

1471
01:46:12,632 --> 01:46:23,201
By taking these people's advice,
our Paappi is going to start his new venture

1472
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:26,140
St. Paappi's English Medium School.

1473
01:46:26,413 --> 01:46:27,380
St.Paappi's?

1474
01:46:27,581 --> 01:46:28,878
Just Paappi doesn't have any style.

1475
01:46:29,082 --> 01:46:31,209
Now you don't have any address.
lt will give you credit for you.

1476
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:34,882
Yes. Malayalam speaking is
injurious to health.

1477
01:46:35,088 --> 01:46:35,554
Hey. What is this?

1478
01:46:35,756 --> 01:46:40,216
lf our Paappi opens a school, then it
would be like starting 100 schools.

1479
01:46:40,527 --> 01:46:42,995
Paappi's way. The actual way.

1480
01:46:43,196 --> 01:46:43,787
Go man.

1481
01:46:45,298 --> 01:46:47,493
Thoroughfare.
- Yes.

1482
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:50,670
lt is very difficult to start
an English medium school, Mathai.

1483
01:46:50,871 --> 01:46:54,398
They won't get permission.
Nothing is going to happen.

1484
01:46:54,608 --> 01:46:57,736
lf he wants, he can start.
He has taken permission earlier.

1485
01:46:57,944 --> 01:47:00,174
The documents regarding
that were in his name.

1486
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:03,747
That is his pride.
- That is too much.

1487
01:47:04,684 --> 01:47:06,584
What is the option to obstruct that?

1488
01:47:06,787 --> 01:47:09,415
Let him start the construction of
the school. After that, we can obstruct.

1489
01:47:09,623 --> 01:47:13,252
Yes. That's enough. That's enough.
You fight with him in this spirit.

1490
01:47:13,493 --> 01:47:17,088
lt's fun to see the fighting
between father and son.

1491
01:47:17,464 --> 01:47:18,931
lf it goes like this, then it
would become a big problem.

1492
01:47:19,132 --> 01:47:22,863
Yes. Yes. The main problem
is about that market.

1493
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:27,267
Farming is the livelihood of 99%
of the people in this place.

1494
01:47:27,808 --> 01:47:31,175
When the father and son were separated,
the market affairs became problematic.

1495
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:34,703
They have fled Manikunju who
came to capture the market.

1496
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:38,209
lf that market collapses,
then this village would be destroyed.

1497
01:47:38,418 --> 01:47:39,942
Then, too, Paappi will play more.

1498
01:47:40,153 --> 01:47:43,452
That's how much he had
abused me in the market.

1499
01:47:43,657 --> 01:47:46,785
Your father has made everything
with the help of Paappi.

1500
01:47:47,394 --> 01:47:52,297
But realizing the truth that father has made
Paappi, then you should sacrifice a little bit.

1501
01:47:52,499 --> 01:47:55,059
Father will come to know
the value of Paappi.

1502
01:47:55,502 --> 01:47:58,062
Otherwise father would say publically,
that he has failed.

1503
01:47:58,271 --> 01:48:01,297
My dog will say.
Who is the father? He or me?

1504
01:48:01,508 --> 01:48:04,136
Wants to defeat his father.
Dirty pathetic fellow.

1505
01:48:04,344 --> 01:48:07,404
Fathers would scold their sons.
They may even beat them.

1506
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:08,975
Mathai has done only this much.

1507
01:48:09,282 --> 01:48:12,308
lf l was in this place, then l would have
killed him and thrown him in the sea.

1508
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:15,084
this is their family matter.

1509
01:48:15,589 --> 01:48:18,490
What is wrong in his statement?
He is having the right to say that.

1510
01:48:18,692 --> 01:48:20,819
He was with me in my bad times.

1511
01:48:21,561 --> 01:48:25,327
Mathai, Jesus told us to
forgive even enemies.

1512
01:48:25,565 --> 01:48:27,260
Then, why are you behaving like
this with to your own son.

1513
01:48:27,467 --> 01:48:28,593
Jesus can say like this.

1514
01:48:28,802 --> 01:48:32,898
He was not married and
didn't have a son like this.

1515
01:48:33,206 --> 01:48:34,901
Jesus had carried only one holy cross.

1516
01:48:35,108 --> 01:48:37,508
l am carrying 3 crosses here.

1517
01:48:39,546 --> 01:48:44,040
Movie exhibition in the church
ground during coming festival.

1518
01:48:44,251 --> 01:48:46,185
Each movie every day.

1519
01:48:46,386 --> 01:48:52,689
Fathers who used to ill-treat their
sons should watch these movies.

1520
01:48:52,893 --> 01:48:54,758
'Makkal Mahatmayaiam'
'Achan Urangathat Veedu'

1521
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:57,864
'Vruthanmaria Sukshikkuka'
'Mera Baap Pehala Aap'

1522
01:48:58,064 --> 01:49:00,191
Daddy cool.

1523
01:49:00,567 --> 01:49:01,591
Daughter, this is too much.

1524
01:49:01,968 --> 01:49:05,199
The people in this village have seen the
father and son with a lot ofjealousy.

1525
01:49:05,739 --> 01:49:08,867
Their love and happiness has
been lost because of you.

1526
01:49:09,309 --> 01:49:12,301
Mother. l have said all that because of
my mental condition at that point of time.

1527
01:49:12,512 --> 01:49:14,036
Then, too, it is too much.

1528
01:49:14,481 --> 01:49:19,885
Now l am praying, my daughter won't get
the curse of the mother & daughter there.

1529
01:49:27,594 --> 01:49:30,495
When we are in a dilemma, then, too,
you won't stop this habit, Paappi.

1530
01:49:30,697 --> 01:49:31,721
Keep quiet and see whether
she is coming.

1531
01:49:31,932 --> 01:49:34,400
Yes, she is coming. Open.
- Where?

1532
01:49:34,668 --> 01:49:36,067
Not in the front. Back side.

1533
01:49:37,537 --> 01:49:38,504
Here.

1534
01:49:45,545 --> 01:49:47,570
Now a days good omen is
in the back side.

1535
01:49:49,749 --> 01:49:51,307
lt's better to consult a doctor.

1536
01:49:51,685 --> 01:49:55,246
Seeing good omen is not
a disease, daughter.

1537
01:49:56,122 --> 01:49:56,986
What did he say?

1538
01:49:57,223 --> 01:49:58,349
Kurup, please stop.

1539
01:49:59,526 --> 01:50:00,515
Kuttappy.
- Yes.

1540
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:02,921
One complaint is there
in Panchayat office.

1541
01:50:03,964 --> 01:50:06,432
Tell the person who has given complaint
to come to the office at 1 1 am.

1542
01:50:06,633 --> 01:50:07,600
Okay.
- Let's go, Kurup.

1543
01:50:07,801 --> 01:50:09,666
1 1 :00 AM

1544
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:20,769
The complaint is that the half land
where Nerappal textile..

1545
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:22,881
..is situated is the land of
Panchayat and that should..

1546
01:50:23,116 --> 01:50:26,608
..be surrendered to
the Panchayat.

1547
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:31,951
ls the person who has given complaint
have family name and father's name?

1548
01:50:32,392 --> 01:50:32,949
No.

1549
01:50:33,226 --> 01:50:36,957
At the end of this complaint, only written
two words, and they are anonymous Paappi.

1550
01:50:37,497 --> 01:50:38,395
l, too, felt so.

1551
01:50:38,732 --> 01:50:40,791
He might be an address less person,

1552
01:50:41,001 --> 01:50:43,469
that's why he has given a complaint
regarding this land.

1553
01:50:44,337 --> 01:50:47,738
That's nice.
- You go out. Go out.

1554
01:50:48,842 --> 01:50:50,400
President, you have read
the complaint, right?

1555
01:50:50,610 --> 01:50:51,736
Take a decision soon.

1556
01:50:51,945 --> 01:50:54,641
l am having another meeting
outside with some gentlemen.

1557
01:50:55,582 --> 01:50:56,981
What is your answer for this?

1558
01:50:57,183 --> 01:51:00,641
President, the shop is situated
in my land.

1559
01:51:00,887 --> 01:51:02,650
lf you have any doubts,
you can measure that.

1560
01:51:03,023 --> 01:51:07,153
l won't take this land when l go
home after closing the shop.

1561
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:09,155
You should measure, president.
You should measure.

1562
01:51:09,629 --> 01:51:12,496
That land was captured by
Nerappal Mathai and family earlier.

1563
01:51:12,699 --> 01:51:17,500
Listen. He couldn't seduce her, that's why
he is saying he wants to measure that land.

1564
01:51:22,042 --> 01:51:24,010
Stop.- This is not the place
to conduct a dance.

1565
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:26,610
This is the Panchayat office.
Be a little more decent.

1566
01:51:26,813 --> 01:51:28,075
Say like that.

1567
01:51:28,782 --> 01:51:31,910
President, this is not enough,

1568
01:51:32,619 --> 01:51:47,796
l will tell the concerned authorities about
the fake dealings of Nerappal Mathai..

1569
01:51:48,234 --> 01:51:50,600
l won't leave.
l've just started.

1570
01:51:51,071 --> 01:51:53,631
My next complaint is to
income tax department.

1571
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,703
Now itself l am going to Delhi.

1572
01:51:55,909 --> 01:51:57,206
Kuttappy.
- Yes.

1573
01:51:58,078 --> 01:51:59,705
Take the jeep.
- Okay.

1574
01:52:01,081 --> 01:52:02,548
Ah! Going to Delhi in a jeep?

1575
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:05,215
Let's enquire.

1576
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,484
Don't worry about income tax people.

1577
01:52:09,689 --> 01:52:12,214
Let's go and surrender everything
before they come here.

1578
01:52:16,296 --> 01:52:17,854
l am not scared about income tax.

1579
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:24,434
lf he tells the secret about me to Maria,
then l will lose my family life.

1580
01:52:24,971 --> 01:52:26,700
What secret, father?
- Go man.

1581
01:52:27,273 --> 01:52:29,207
Father. His mother's...

1582
01:52:29,609 --> 01:52:33,204
As per this stay order,
Paappi is having equal right in all..

1583
01:52:33,646 --> 01:52:35,614
..businesses which
Nerappal Mathai is conducting.

1584
01:52:35,849 --> 01:52:38,010
He is having the documents
for proving that.

1585
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:44,119
Because of this case, court has
stopped all transactions of Mathai.

1586
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:46,620
As per our language,
transactions are freezed.

1587
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,127
ln brief,

1588
01:52:48,328 --> 01:52:53,766
l can't take any money from the bank before
the court reaches a conclusion in this case.

1589
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,533
Right, Advocate?
- Yes.

1590
01:52:58,171 --> 01:53:01,140
Then l will come and meet
you in the office.- Okay.

1591
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:02,137
Okay.

1592
01:53:07,113 --> 01:53:08,978
We should send this stay to Paappi first.

1593
01:53:09,182 --> 01:53:12,310
What is there to freeze for a person
who doesn't possess anything?

1594
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:20,152
Salary of staff, money of chits, payment,
everything is in problem now.

1595
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:26,330
What will l do to face this bad situation
till the case gets over, my Jesus?

1596
01:53:28,168 --> 01:53:30,762
Shashankan
- Ah! Mathai, l am in tight.

1597
01:53:31,437 --> 01:53:34,338
Hey, l have called you to know the time
because my watch is not working.

1598
01:53:35,441 --> 01:53:36,408
12

1599
01:53:37,377 --> 01:53:39,174
How fast the time is running, right?

1600
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:42,004
Maria.
- Yes.

1601
01:53:42,215 --> 01:53:47,414
You have five acres of land
near that canal, right?

1602
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:50,621
Ah! Five acres.
Anything else is there?

1603
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:53,349
You think.
On whose name this house is?

1604
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:54,456
For what?

1605
01:53:54,961 --> 01:53:56,758
lf l was in the place of Mathai,

1606
01:53:56,963 --> 01:54:00,091
then l would have sold everything
and taken revenge on Paappi.

1607
01:54:01,868 --> 01:54:04,200
That...to teach him a lesson.

1608
01:54:05,738 --> 01:54:10,698
Maria, for meeting the present needs,
let's sell that 5 acres of land.

1609
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:16,041
Yes. That is smartness.
l will bring people to buy that.

1610
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:22,110
Anyway, don't forget to convey
my regards to your mother.- Okay.

1611
01:54:31,397 --> 01:54:32,523
Why is it raining suddenly?

1612
01:54:37,103 --> 01:54:39,867
Are you standing here because
it is raining or to confess?

1613
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:43,209
Surprized to see you in church.

1614
01:54:45,245 --> 01:54:47,440
Come. l will drop you near yourjeep.

1615
01:54:47,914 --> 01:54:50,940
No need of that.
- Come.

1616
01:55:05,832 --> 01:55:11,134
l am also feeling sorry for all these.
Why did you cancel my marriage?

1617
01:55:11,604 --> 01:55:13,504
That's why these entire
problems arose.

1618
01:55:13,773 --> 01:55:15,570
l haven't cancelled anyone's marriage.

1619
01:55:15,875 --> 01:55:18,969
l, too, said something when l heard that
you came & created a scene in my house.

1620
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:22,840
l haven't thought about the situation.
- Who cancelled the marriage?

1621
01:55:23,383 --> 01:55:25,408
lt might be him. Shashankan.

1622
01:55:25,885 --> 01:55:28,945
He will benefit if l and
my father get separated.

1623
01:55:29,622 --> 01:55:32,147
Then why didn't you tell
this to your father?

1624
01:55:32,558 --> 01:55:33,752
Then problems would've been solved.

1625
01:55:34,961 --> 01:55:35,689
For that?

1626
01:55:36,296 --> 01:55:40,824
Till now, we lived like friends, then,
too, he didn't understand me.

1627
01:55:41,301 --> 01:55:43,098
Then how will l make him
understand everything?

1628
01:56:08,661 --> 01:56:09,457
Sorry.

1629
01:56:10,163 --> 01:56:11,858
l was about to fall down.

1630
01:56:36,289 --> 01:56:37,984
Get into the vehicle, fast.
l will drop your at your house.

1631
01:56:38,358 --> 01:56:40,758
No. l will go walking.
- Get in.

1632
01:57:31,077 --> 01:57:33,545
" We are always seeing
each other always.''

1633
01:57:33,746 --> 01:57:37,477
" But for a long time we are
not talking to each other.''

1634
01:57:38,184 --> 01:57:44,885
" We used to look into the eyes.''
"But your heart is full of spine.''

1635
01:57:45,425 --> 01:57:52,058
" Even the time flies goes''
"even the years gets over''

1636
01:57:52,265 --> 01:57:59,171
" Your sweet sound..''
"..becomes the songs of shalom.''

1637
01:58:56,496 --> 01:59:03,129
" Hey autumn, who adds honey
in the lips of bees?''

1638
01:59:03,569 --> 01:59:10,304
" Did you see the mango tree
in front of my house?''

1639
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:17,473
" Hey butterfly, you fly.''
"fly and sit in the branch.''

1640
01:59:17,683 --> 01:59:24,816
" Without making the falling mango
flowers fall and take the honey.''

1641
01:59:25,024 --> 01:59:31,486
" l wish for wings to fly.''

1642
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:17,936
" Counting the days.''
"the sky has waited.''

1643
02:00:18,411 --> 02:00:25,044
" Waves, is the time to
come me reached?''

1644
02:00:25,318 --> 02:00:32,383
" Let the cold make bed for me.''
"Let the bed sheet cover me.''

1645
02:00:32,592 --> 02:00:39,657
" Let the shining pearl say''
"whatever you possess is mine.''

1646
02:00:39,865 --> 02:00:46,566
" You will spread me like the cold.''

1647
02:01:23,909 --> 02:01:26,776
Hey. Reached your house.

1648
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:32,950
Hey. Thanks.

1649
02:01:40,493 --> 02:01:44,122
We can't say that Manikunju is behind
that by seeing him there at that time.

1650
02:01:45,398 --> 02:01:48,697
Yes. l have seen revenge
in his eye.

1651
02:01:49,368 --> 02:01:50,630
l was with Annie then.

1652
02:01:51,003 --> 02:01:52,368
l will get my hand on him.

1653
02:01:53,005 --> 02:01:54,404
Jesus will bring him in front of me.

1654
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:55,807
Brother.

1655
02:01:58,911 --> 02:01:59,969
Why you came here?

1656
02:02:00,179 --> 02:02:01,237
l came here without
the knowledge of father.

1657
02:02:01,447 --> 02:02:03,540
Brother, you don't want
to see us, right?

1658
02:02:03,816 --> 02:02:05,306
Who told you that l am
not seeing you?

1659
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:11,154
Mother and you go to the church and
you go for studying in front of Paappi.

1660
02:02:12,191 --> 02:02:15,922
l am not interested in creating
a scene by going in front of mother.

1661
02:02:16,295 --> 02:02:18,490
Brother, why did you file
complaint against father?

1662
02:02:19,965 --> 02:02:22,934
Whoever is with father now
will now eat his property.

1663
02:02:23,202 --> 02:02:24,931
That belongs to you also.

1664
02:02:25,805 --> 02:02:28,103
l thought a lot and
took that decision.

1665
02:02:28,941 --> 02:02:30,340
ln every war, situations like
this would always arise.

1666
02:02:30,576 --> 02:02:33,443
Leave that. How is our father?

1667
02:02:33,646 --> 02:02:35,170
l came here to tell that.

1668
02:02:35,381 --> 02:02:38,680
He is going to sell the 5 acres
of land in mother's name.

1669
02:02:39,218 --> 02:02:40,014
That land?

1670
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:43,689
l have avoided that land when l filed the
case because that is in mother's name.

1671
02:02:43,889 --> 02:02:46,016
That Shashankan is arranging all this.

1672
02:02:46,258 --> 02:02:48,624
JCB is coming tomorrow
for cleaning that land.

1673
02:02:52,798 --> 02:02:53,492
You go.

1674
02:03:02,541 --> 02:03:03,872
Mathai, drink water.

1675
02:03:04,110 --> 02:03:06,704
What else l have to suffer
more than this?

1676
02:03:17,423 --> 02:03:27,890
Around 1 ,500 years old antique pieces
are found from Nerappal Mathai's land.

1677
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:32,400
All these were found when they were
cleaning this land with JCB.

1678
02:03:32,772 --> 02:03:37,004
Now JCB's driver Velayudan is with us.
Let's ask Velayudan about this.

1679
02:03:37,209 --> 02:03:39,177
Tell me Velayudan.
Who saw it first?

1680
02:03:39,378 --> 02:03:42,677
You or this JCB or villagers?
Tell me.

1681
02:03:42,882 --> 02:03:47,251
l have seen them firstly.
We were taking sand from that part.

1682
02:03:47,853 --> 02:03:48,842
l am not lying.

1683
02:03:49,121 --> 02:03:52,648
When l was taking the land, l felt that
this sand wasn't normal one.

1684
02:03:52,858 --> 02:03:56,760
JCB's couldn't dig in.
l told that to my assistant.

1685
02:03:56,962 --> 02:03:59,430
Yes. Yes. Boss told me that.
- You keep quite.

1686
02:03:59,632 --> 02:04:00,428
l will speak. l am the driver.

1687
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:03,767
When l started cleaning,
l felt tensed.

1688
02:04:03,969 --> 02:04:05,800
Why so? ls it because of the reason that
you won't get money for your work?

1689
02:04:06,005 --> 02:04:08,997
l got the money early itself.
Not that.

1690
02:04:09,408 --> 02:04:12,275
When l tried to dig,
l couldn't do that.

1691
02:04:12,478 --> 02:04:17,939
When l went down and looked,
l saw these antique pieces.- Yes.

1692
02:04:18,150 --> 02:04:21,278
l will tell you something which
no one should believe.

1693
02:04:21,487 --> 02:04:25,446
l have seen light in that area.
- Thank you, Mr. Velayudan.

1694
02:04:25,825 --> 02:04:29,955
For more details regarding this,
let's talk to Nerappal Mathai.

1695
02:04:30,663 --> 02:04:32,187
By getting all these antique pieces,

1696
02:04:32,398 --> 02:04:36,960
this 5 acres land is taken by
archeological department for observation.

1697
02:04:37,169 --> 02:04:40,900
What is your reaction seeing this
decision of archeological department?

1698
02:04:41,106 --> 02:04:43,233
Archeological department,
your mother's..

1699
02:04:44,109 --> 02:04:49,411
l am very happy.
Can't even sit because of happiness.

1700
02:04:49,849 --> 02:04:53,649
These are tears of happiness.
- You keep quite.

1701
02:04:54,553 --> 02:04:56,145
Paappi is not a fool.

1702
02:04:57,056 --> 02:04:59,820
How much is the cost of buying all those
antique pieices from Mannadiyar's shop?

1703
02:05:00,025 --> 02:05:00,821
Rs.40000.

1704
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:02,484
How much you have given
to that JCB driver?

1705
02:05:02,695 --> 02:05:04,595
Rs.10000.
- Then for arcriyology department.

1706
02:05:04,797 --> 02:05:06,162
Not arcriyology, fool.

1707
02:05:06,365 --> 02:05:07,332
Arcricollege.

1708
02:05:07,533 --> 02:05:11,162
Any way, they were also very greedy.
l have given them Rs.10000.

1709
02:05:11,537 --> 02:05:12,765
That is too much.

1710
02:05:13,472 --> 02:05:16,839
l have taken that money for
36% interest from Jose.

1711
02:05:17,209 --> 02:05:20,178
Then, too, no problem.
l have taught a big lesson to my father.

1712
02:05:20,379 --> 02:05:24,008
But 5 acres is gone to the government.
Paappi, this is too much.

1713
02:05:24,216 --> 02:05:25,945
How hard he worked for making that.

1714
02:05:26,151 --> 02:05:28,676
This is nothing.
Nothing would happen to that land.

1715
02:05:28,888 --> 02:05:30,355
l have taken that surety from them.

1716
02:05:30,623 --> 02:05:32,352
For 2 months it would go on like this.

1717
02:05:32,825 --> 02:05:34,918
When the actual enquiry comes,
everything would get over.

1718
02:05:35,294 --> 02:05:37,558
They will think that some robbers
would have done that.

1719
02:05:37,763 --> 02:05:39,958
Oh! What a brain.

1720
02:05:40,566 --> 02:05:44,525
That is my mother's land.
Besides me, who will take care of that?

1721
02:05:50,409 --> 02:05:52,377
What is the use of all this, brother?

1722
02:05:52,578 --> 02:05:54,978
l am also always asking
this with him.

1723
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:56,875
Hey. Go and see whether
the curry is cooked.

1724
02:05:57,082 --> 02:05:59,380
You always cook for me only,
then what is there so special to see?

1725
02:05:59,585 --> 02:06:01,644
l will give you one.
- Who is making the food here?

1726
02:06:01,854 --> 02:06:03,719
Morning food is from Kunjali's shop.
- Okay.

1727
02:06:03,923 --> 02:06:05,447
He makes lunch.

1728
02:06:05,791 --> 02:06:08,817
The sambhar which he made yesterday
is there under that coconut tree.

1729
02:06:09,028 --> 02:06:10,222
Even crows didn't touch it.

1730
02:06:10,596 --> 02:06:13,394
A dog which came here in the morning
told me it was good for loose motions.

1731
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:14,156
You blame me.

1732
02:06:14,366 --> 02:06:18,166
lf there's nothing here,
l will take it from neighbor's house.

1733
02:06:18,771 --> 02:06:19,738
Mollykutty, you know.

1734
02:06:20,105 --> 02:06:24,235
Poor neighbhors are seeing me like God,
that's why we are living.

1735
02:06:24,443 --> 02:06:26,001
Like God?
- Yes.

1736
02:06:26,278 --> 02:06:29,179
Yesterday when the chillies got over,
l went to the neighbhor's house.

1737
02:06:29,381 --> 02:06:30,678
You know what they told me?

1738
02:06:30,883 --> 02:06:33,750
God, you came again?
Right, brother?

1739
02:06:34,053 --> 02:06:34,917
Go man.

1740
02:06:35,354 --> 02:06:37,254
Anyway, brother, you look tired.

1741
02:06:37,623 --> 02:06:42,356
But villagers are saying that
Nerappal Mathai is having problems.

1742
02:06:43,462 --> 02:06:45,259
Did you start calling your father
by his name?

1743
02:06:45,464 --> 02:06:48,433
Jesus. Mother started speaking.

1744
02:06:48,634 --> 02:06:51,102
lf l start talking, then you don't
have anything to reply.

1745
02:06:52,571 --> 02:06:54,095
You come back home.

1746
02:06:54,473 --> 02:06:58,705
Mother, father has thrown me
out of the house by..

1747
02:06:58,978 --> 02:07:01,344
..listening to someone else.

1748
02:07:02,114 --> 02:07:05,777
When father comes and calls me,
then only l will come.

1749
02:07:05,985 --> 02:07:08,180
You father and son fight
with each other.

1750
02:07:08,721 --> 02:07:12,350
2 more souls who know only
to love are there in that house.

1751
02:07:12,825 --> 02:07:14,224
Don't forget that.

1752
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:19,392
l had come with this poor man
after abandoning everything.

1753
02:07:20,499 --> 02:07:22,467
With whom l will stand?

1754
02:07:23,369 --> 02:07:26,065
With my husband or with my son?

1755
02:07:26,271 --> 02:07:28,466
With whom l will stand?
Tell me.

1756
02:07:28,674 --> 02:07:31,472
Mother. l don't want to
see you in tears.

1757
02:07:32,044 --> 02:07:34,308
You haven't seen your mother crying.

1758
02:07:35,614 --> 02:07:40,313
When we came to that house which we are
staying in now, we had a small baby, too.

1759
02:07:40,853 --> 02:07:43,822
Your elder one.
My poor child.

1760
02:07:44,757 --> 02:07:48,784
When l think about that,
my heart aches.

1761
02:07:49,361 --> 02:07:52,728
Because of measles...
we didn't have money to treat.

1762
02:07:53,866 --> 02:07:55,424
He died in my hands.

1763
02:07:56,368 --> 02:07:58,495
l didn't even fully satisfy
with my desire of loving him.

1764
02:07:58,704 --> 02:08:01,172
Before that itself,
Jesus had taken him back.

1765
02:08:05,878 --> 02:08:11,908
You know what your father whom you're going
to defeat told me that time to console me?

1766
02:08:12,985 --> 02:08:18,013
Jesus would give us a son.
He would give us happiness.

1767
02:08:18,490 --> 02:08:20,583
He would look after us.

1768
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:25,290
You are taking revenge on that poor man.

1769
02:08:26,432 --> 02:08:31,529
Our house was an heaven because
of you father and son's unity.

1770
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:34,361
When did the devil come
into your mind?

1771
02:08:35,007 --> 02:08:36,975
Mother, you think in whose mind
is devil in this house

1772
02:08:37,076 --> 02:08:38,976
whose mind do you think is devil
in this house mine or father's?

1773
02:08:39,178 --> 02:08:41,203
Kuttappy, take them home.
- Okay.

1774
02:08:46,919 --> 02:08:49,649
l will return your money.
But now l am in a problem.

1775
02:08:50,022 --> 02:08:54,049
You father and son do anything.
What have we done?

1776
02:08:54,259 --> 02:08:57,888
The people in this place are not making
any problems because of us.

1777
02:08:58,097 --> 02:09:00,224
Take a decision within 2 days.

1778
02:09:00,432 --> 02:09:02,400
People in the market told me that
they will find an alternative for this.

1779
02:09:02,601 --> 02:09:07,129
How many times l have told you?
So Mathai, you find a solution for this.

1780
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:09,237
l am saying this because
of my love for you.

1781
02:09:09,942 --> 02:09:10,840
Walk. Walk.

1782
02:09:13,445 --> 02:09:16,573
When Paappi was here, he used
to arrange money somehow.

1783
02:09:17,683 --> 02:09:21,483
Mathai, me and the others didn't face
any difficulty for money.

1784
02:09:21,687 --> 02:09:23,678
He was very strict in money matters.

1785
02:09:24,323 --> 02:09:28,919
Hey. l heard that Choolaparambil
Sosamma's daughter delivered.- Yes.

1786
02:09:29,128 --> 02:09:30,595
Baby boy.
- Baby boy?

1787
02:09:30,796 --> 02:09:32,923
Yes.
- What is the use?

1788
02:10:13,839 --> 02:10:16,307
Daughter, one tea for me.
What about you?

1789
02:10:16,508 --> 02:10:18,635
Mathai doesn't need.
He has just taken his tablet.

1790
02:10:18,844 --> 02:10:20,368
You have blood pressure problem, right?

1791
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:22,977
There is one problem with
the blood pressure tablet.

1792
02:10:23,182 --> 02:10:25,980
lf we start eating,
then we can't stop it.

1793
02:10:27,753 --> 02:10:29,311
That is the situation of life, too.

1794
02:10:29,521 --> 02:10:32,888
lf we start failing,
then we have time only to fail.

1795
02:10:33,358 --> 02:10:36,657
Did you forget me, Mathai?
We have metjust once only.

1796
02:10:37,129 --> 02:10:40,826
How will you forget me, right?
That time you had taken my dhothi.

1797
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:42,098
Shall l tell you the truth?

1798
02:10:42,334 --> 02:10:44,894
That time l feltjealous of you
and not angry.

1799
02:10:45,103 --> 02:10:50,063
By seeing people's love and trust on you.
What was the trick, Mathai?

1800
02:10:50,442 --> 02:10:54,776
l don't have this much value in my place.
All are related to money.

1801
02:10:55,414 --> 02:10:59,009
Even though l have given money,
they have taken your side when they saw you.

1802
02:10:59,218 --> 02:11:01,186
All this because of love.

1803
02:11:01,954 --> 02:11:04,514
The people in this place are
like his own children for Mathai.

1804
02:11:04,723 --> 02:11:06,350
Oh! ls that the reason
behind this love?

1805
02:11:06,558 --> 02:11:08,685
Listen, Mathai. Don't consider
me as an outsider.

1806
02:11:08,894 --> 02:11:12,762
Take it as respect to Nerappal Mathai.
l know your situation.

1807
02:11:12,965 --> 02:11:15,263
Take this money inside by thinking
that it's your own money.

1808
02:11:16,001 --> 02:11:18,026
Let everything go smoothly.
- Yes.

1809
02:11:20,405 --> 02:11:23,465
lf you won't take it like that,
then you take it as loan.

1810
02:11:24,409 --> 02:11:26,036
lf men become friends,

1811
02:11:26,712 --> 02:11:29,613
then the name of this piece of paper
is something else.

1812
02:11:32,751 --> 02:11:36,710
l have a request, Mathai.
Don't destroy that market.

1813
02:11:36,922 --> 02:11:41,291
There is no noise and people now.
lf you can't run that, then you sell it.

1814
02:11:42,094 --> 02:11:45,393
Don't misunderstand me thinking
that l'm here to buy your market.

1815
02:11:45,864 --> 02:11:50,801
Sell that to someone, Mathai.
You have become old.

1816
02:11:51,003 --> 02:11:56,805
Enjoy your life with that money.
People lost trust in you.

1817
02:11:57,009 --> 02:11:59,239
lt's better to sell that market, Mathai.

1818
02:11:59,745 --> 02:12:00,575
Manikunju.

1819
02:12:01,947 --> 02:12:07,078
l haven't talked till now
not because l didn't understand..

1820
02:12:07,286 --> 02:12:09,151
..your love and motive behind that.

1821
02:12:09,788 --> 02:12:12,655
lf any dog comes and barks
in front of this house,

1822
02:12:13,225 --> 02:12:14,920
l would listen to him also
for a while.

1823
02:12:15,127 --> 02:12:19,587
For knowing whether that barking is
for some reason or for making fun of us.

1824
02:12:21,466 --> 02:12:24,094
lf l won't talk now, then you would
try to buy even my father.

1825
02:12:24,303 --> 02:12:28,763
So Manikunju boss,
please get up from there.

1826
02:12:29,141 --> 02:12:33,601
Then you go away from here with
this box which is full of love. Go. Go.

1827
02:12:33,812 --> 02:12:34,938
Go away from here soon. Fast.

1828
02:12:43,822 --> 02:12:44,345
Tea.

1829
02:12:44,556 --> 02:12:48,458
Tea is cancelled. You go inside.
Shashankan, go out.

1830
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:49,627
Yes. Yes.

1831
02:12:54,166 --> 02:12:59,126
He is sinking in water, and then, too, his
pride is not decreased or weakened.

1832
02:12:59,938 --> 02:13:03,305
l tried to get that from him
by showing love.

1833
02:13:04,343 --> 02:13:06,140
But my fate is to get by force.

1834
02:13:29,067 --> 02:13:34,334
Come. Come.
- Sit.

1835
02:13:34,539 --> 02:13:35,437
No.
- Sit there.

1836
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:38,905
This Paappi won't drink liquor
made by someone else.

1837
02:13:41,313 --> 02:13:47,274
Kesavan, l wouldn't have
come here if l knew..

1838
02:13:47,486 --> 02:13:49,511
..that people like him
would come here.

1839
02:13:49,721 --> 02:13:50,847
Here. Here.

1840
02:13:51,123 --> 02:13:57,858
l came here after knowing that
some old boss is here.

1841
02:13:58,397 --> 02:14:01,855
l want to speak to boss.
- When did l become boss?

1842
02:14:02,067 --> 02:14:05,468
Boss of check post?
- Keep quiet and listen.

1843
02:14:05,737 --> 02:14:10,197
lf you have failed, then admit it.
- God. You found that, too.

1844
02:14:10,575 --> 02:14:11,974
Yes. l failed in 10th standard.

1845
02:14:12,277 --> 02:14:18,546
l have entered this job
using a fake certificate.

1846
02:14:19,785 --> 02:14:24,051
Keep quiet and listen, Mappila.
- Mappila?

1847
02:14:26,358 --> 02:14:34,732
lf you try to dupe the people in this
place with the help of an outsider,

1848
02:14:35,033 --> 02:14:36,227
this Paappi won't sit like this.

1849
02:14:36,435 --> 02:14:39,962
You can't sit properly,
it is because of piles.

1850
02:14:40,172 --> 02:14:44,074
That too, you found.
- l won't allow.

1851
02:14:44,276 --> 02:14:47,734
lf you want to tell anything,
then tell directly. That's courage.

1852
02:14:48,447 --> 02:14:53,578
Then you listen, the market in
this village is mine too.

1853
02:14:54,052 --> 02:15:00,855
l heard that you are going to
sell that market to Manikunju.

1854
02:15:01,193 --> 02:15:02,421
l won't allow that..

1855
02:15:03,195 --> 02:15:04,753
Who needs your permission?

1856
02:15:05,230 --> 02:15:07,425
Till now l haven't taken a decision.

1857
02:15:07,632 --> 02:15:08,758
Now l am saying,

1858
02:15:08,967 --> 02:15:13,768
l am going to sell market to Manikunju
to take revenge on you.

1859
02:15:13,972 --> 02:15:17,533
You won't do anything.
l will sell it for the money which l get.

1860
02:15:17,742 --> 02:15:20,677
l will do that, if l am alive.

1861
02:15:20,879 --> 02:15:22,278
lf you have the courage,
then you stop me.

1862
02:15:23,315 --> 02:15:26,944
lf l can't block stop that,
then you consider Paappi is dead.

1863
02:15:30,155 --> 02:15:32,953
Mathai, there is something
smelling in the words of Paappi.

1864
02:15:33,158 --> 02:15:34,125
You go man.

1865
02:15:35,827 --> 02:15:37,954
Where is that Shashankan?

1866
02:15:38,163 --> 02:15:42,862
Anyway, you go now.
Let me think what to do.- Okay.

1867
02:15:49,774 --> 02:15:54,302
Besides Panchayat President,
whom will we tell about the market?

1868
02:15:56,281 --> 02:15:58,408
lf Manikunju gets that,
then everything would get finished.

1869
02:15:58,717 --> 02:16:01,481
Knowingly or unknowingly,
everything started from the teacher.

1870
02:16:01,686 --> 02:16:05,486
You have to find a solution to the
problem that started with you, teacher.

1871
02:16:23,308 --> 02:16:24,605
lf l come to power,

1872
02:16:25,010 --> 02:16:31,711
then l will make a co-operative
society for the people in this village.

1873
02:16:32,417 --> 02:16:35,875
My dream project.

1874
02:16:36,488 --> 02:16:42,222
My decision is to use the market
which is now owned by Nerappal family.

1875
02:16:42,894 --> 02:16:44,987
lf the farmer brings his
product to the market,

1876
02:16:45,263 --> 02:16:48,061
then it would be auctioned under
the supervision of the Panchayat.

1877
02:16:48,266 --> 02:16:53,329
Then the most important matter is to attract
the outside merchants to this market.

1878
02:16:53,705 --> 02:16:57,732
80% of the profit of auction would
go to the farmers and..

1879
02:16:57,943 --> 02:17:00,741
..20% for running
the co-operative society.

1880
02:17:01,179 --> 02:17:02,806
lf this project is implemented,

1881
02:17:03,014 --> 02:17:07,007
then the farmers in lttirikandam village
would get double the profit which they

1882
02:17:07,219 --> 02:17:08,413
are getting now.

1883
02:17:21,466 --> 02:17:24,924
The person you are calling
is out of coverage area.

1884
02:17:25,136 --> 02:17:26,603
Whenever l call him, he would be
out of coverage area.

1885
02:17:40,485 --> 02:17:43,283
Hello.
- Hello, Dasan master. Annie here.

1886
02:17:44,656 --> 02:17:46,453
l know l am disturbing you
in at the night.

1887
02:17:47,192 --> 02:17:49,626
But l felt the need to inform
you now itself.

1888
02:17:50,428 --> 02:17:51,258
What is the matter, teacher?

1889
02:17:51,796 --> 02:17:56,233
Master, at last we are going to find
a solution to the market problem.

1890
02:17:56,434 --> 02:17:57,628
A nice idea.

1891
02:17:58,103 --> 02:18:00,697
Nerappal people are not selling
that market to anyone.

1892
02:18:01,072 --> 02:18:03,700
lnstead of that,
Panchayat is taking over it.

1893
02:18:12,384 --> 02:18:15,319
Master, may l tell you
something interesting?

1894
02:18:15,654 --> 02:18:17,485
Do you know who is the
master brain behind this?

1895
02:18:18,189 --> 02:18:19,417
That is the Teacher herself.

1896
02:18:20,191 --> 02:18:21,215
Not me.

1897
02:18:21,426 --> 02:18:22,825
lf l say, you won't believe.

1898
02:18:23,094 --> 02:18:26,495
Not anyone else.
Our Paappi is behind this.- ls it?

1899
02:18:27,032 --> 02:18:30,593
l have called Paappi now.
But he is out of range.

1900
02:18:31,369 --> 02:18:33,837
Hello. Master, are you listening?

1901
02:18:34,039 --> 02:18:37,668
Yes. Yes. l am listening.
Teacher, this is nice.

1902
02:18:37,876 --> 02:18:40,674
l am also thrilled.
lt would be a success.

1903
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:41,504
You wait and see.

1904
02:18:41,813 --> 02:18:44,008
This would be a golden feather
in the crown of the President.

1905
02:18:44,215 --> 02:18:46,615
See you in the morning.
- Okay. Good night.

1906
02:18:49,187 --> 02:18:50,814
Slowly. Slowly.

1907
02:18:51,489 --> 02:18:53,480
You should have come nicely
in that vehicle.

1908
02:18:54,192 --> 02:18:56,160
You told me we should walk a little,
but we walked a lot.

1909
02:18:56,528 --> 02:18:59,156
We should have come in
the vehicle, right?- Yes.

1910
02:19:00,165 --> 02:19:02,326
What Mathai wants to
speak to me about?

1911
02:19:02,534 --> 02:19:06,994
ls Manikunju a nice person?

1912
02:19:07,205 --> 02:19:09,002
Mathai, why are you asking
a question like this?

1913
02:19:09,207 --> 02:19:13,667
l am planning something
in my mind.

1914
02:19:14,112 --> 02:19:17,013
l just asked for your opinion.

1915
02:19:20,118 --> 02:19:27,183
Ah! What happened? Ah! Mathai.

1916
02:19:34,065 --> 02:19:37,193
Ah! Help. Help.

1917
02:19:41,306 --> 02:19:48,212
Mother. Come fast...
See, Mathai.

1918
02:19:48,413 --> 02:19:51,940
Ah! What is this?
Who stabbed Mathai?

1919
02:19:54,085 --> 02:19:55,211
Paappi.

1920
02:19:56,721 --> 02:19:57,881
Paappi.

1921
02:19:59,190 --> 02:19:59,986
Paappi?!

1922
02:20:02,026 --> 02:20:04,119
Paappi. Stop. Stop.

1923
02:20:05,163 --> 02:20:06,323
Have you come here to die?

1924
02:20:06,765 --> 02:20:09,063
Paappi, where had you been?
Why didn't you tell me?

1925
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:13,236
Searching for you since last night.
Mobile was out of range.

1926
02:20:13,438 --> 02:20:15,906
l had gone to the town to arrange
money for the market.

1927
02:20:16,107 --> 02:20:16,903
What happened?

1928
02:20:17,242 --> 02:20:21,474
Paappi.
- Hey, what happened?

1929
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:23,238
Father.

1930
02:20:33,725 --> 02:20:34,589
What is the matter, sir?

1931
02:20:34,793 --> 02:20:37,591
Paappi boss doesn't know anything, right?

1932
02:20:38,329 --> 02:20:39,296
Tell me what the matter is.

1933
02:20:39,798 --> 02:20:41,493
Get into the vehicle
without wasting time.

1934
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:43,993
Sir, my father is in the hospital
after someone stabbed him.

1935
02:20:44,202 --> 02:20:44,930
Shall l go there?

1936
02:20:45,737 --> 02:20:47,762
lf you go there, then too,
you can't see your father.

1937
02:20:47,972 --> 02:20:50,270
That place is full of police..
..for arresting you.

1938
02:20:50,475 --> 02:20:53,774
Let the credit of arresting you
be in my name.

1939
02:20:54,379 --> 02:20:55,846
What crime have l committed?

1940
02:20:56,414 --> 02:20:58,382
You have threatened your father
by saying you will kill him.

1941
02:20:58,583 --> 02:21:02,576
There is proof and eye witness
in the case that you have..

1942
02:21:02,821 --> 02:21:04,049
..tried to kill Nerappal Mathai
by stabbing him.

1943
02:21:05,223 --> 02:21:11,219
Sir.l.. my father..
Sir, what are you saying?

1944
02:21:11,429 --> 02:21:12,293
Hey, come out.

1945
02:21:13,164 --> 02:21:17,931
Where have you kidnapped and
hidden Panchayat President Annie teacher?

1946
02:21:19,170 --> 02:21:19,636
Annie?

1947
02:21:19,838 --> 02:21:24,036
ln the complaint, it is mentioned that it
is revenge of splitting you and your father.

1948
02:21:24,242 --> 02:21:25,140
Whose complaint?

1949
02:21:25,343 --> 02:21:28,176
That we, the police, will inform
the concerned people.

1950
02:21:28,513 --> 02:21:30,208
Are you opposing me?

1951
02:21:31,683 --> 02:21:32,980
Hey, walk.

1952
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:37,647
l heard that you are too smart.

1953
02:21:37,922 --> 02:21:40,686
So let this bangle be in
your hand for some time.

1954
02:22:00,979 --> 02:22:04,005
l am too smart. But l am not
a crooked man like you.

1955
02:22:04,549 --> 02:22:06,278
This bangle suits you more.

1956
02:22:06,818 --> 02:22:08,683
Now you have shown the behavior which
won't suit either a man or a woman.

1957
02:22:08,887 --> 02:22:10,184
Paappi, you don't make a mistake.

1958
02:22:10,388 --> 02:22:12,356
lf l come with you now,
then it would be a mistake.

1959
02:22:12,891 --> 02:22:15,291
Then this Paappi won't see
sunlight for some time.

1960
02:22:15,894 --> 02:22:19,796
My father and Annie need me now.
So l need some time.

1961
02:22:20,565 --> 02:22:23,864
Sir, you have given something
which l don't need.

1962
02:22:26,638 --> 02:22:28,037
l have returned it.

1963
02:22:28,406 --> 02:22:31,204
l am not taking this key.
l will forget it somewhere.

1964
02:22:31,409 --> 02:22:32,706
So l am keeping it in the vehicle.

1965
02:22:34,078 --> 02:22:35,204
l am putting in this.

1966
02:22:35,413 --> 02:22:36,880
Hey.
- Diesel is less.

1967
02:22:37,081 --> 02:22:38,639
When l put the key inside the tank,
l heard the sound of tin.

1968
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:40,875
Hey. Paappi, you have to pay for this.

1969
02:22:41,386 --> 02:22:42,478
You go, sir.

1970
02:22:42,687 --> 02:22:45,383
l know who is making you
to do all this.

1971
02:22:46,190 --> 02:22:49,557
Hey. Hey. Stop there. Stop.

1972
02:22:54,933 --> 02:22:56,332
Don't run. Stop there.

1973
02:23:06,611 --> 02:23:08,078
Hey, Paappi. Run.

1974
02:23:53,524 --> 02:23:56,982
Why did you stab my father?
- l didn't.

1975
02:23:57,428 --> 02:24:00,090
Then who stabbed my father
and kidnapped Annie?

1976
02:24:03,701 --> 02:24:05,328
Tell me.
- l will tell.

1977
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:07,838
l will tell you everything.

1978
02:24:08,306 --> 02:24:10,433
lt's true that l am having
a grouse against you.

1979
02:24:10,842 --> 02:24:13,003
But Shashankan won't kill anyone.

1980
02:24:13,378 --> 02:24:16,176
That's why l took Mathai to the
hospital with the help of people.

1981
02:24:16,381 --> 02:24:17,575
Who stabbed him?

1982
02:24:18,416 --> 02:24:22,113
He. He has done everything.
- Who?

1983
02:24:31,696 --> 02:24:32,321
Leave me.

1984
02:24:34,532 --> 02:24:36,659
Hey, come out.

1985
02:24:40,772 --> 02:24:42,330
Come here.

1986
02:24:52,150 --> 02:24:53,174
Catch her.

1987
02:25:17,542 --> 02:25:18,372
Master.

1988
02:25:21,913 --> 02:25:23,540
What? What happened?

1989
02:25:24,348 --> 02:25:25,372
l don't know.

1990
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:27,775
l left home to see you
in the morning, master.

1991
02:25:28,252 --> 02:25:29,116
That time these people..

1992
02:25:41,432 --> 02:25:44,401
What is this Manikunju boss?

1993
02:25:47,371 --> 02:25:51,273
When the story enters the climax
chasing is very common, master.

1994
02:25:51,843 --> 02:25:57,179
Even though you try to save her, master,
in this story, he's teacher's hero.

1995
02:25:57,381 --> 02:25:59,906
That Paappi. Nerappal Paappi.

1996
02:26:02,286 --> 02:26:04,686
lf Paappi is the hero,
then who is master?

1997
02:26:05,957 --> 02:26:10,758
Villain. Best villain.
Right, master?

1998
02:26:30,281 --> 02:26:31,373
Dasan master.

1999
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:45,121
What happened, teacher? Scared?

2000
02:26:46,998 --> 02:26:49,626
l am Dasan master himself.
But a small change.

2001
02:26:50,334 --> 02:26:55,135
l am not that poor Dasan master who
comes to teach students in Nerappal school

2002
02:26:55,840 --> 02:27:02,803
l am son of Radhakrishna Kaimal who ruled
this lttirikandam village 20 years back.

2003
02:27:03,181 --> 02:27:04,580
Shivadasa Kaimal.

2004
02:27:13,524 --> 02:27:18,257
Dasan. Dasan master. l...

2005
02:27:20,097 --> 02:27:22,725
Because of my father's extravagance,
the property which l should enjoy..

2006
02:27:22,934 --> 02:27:24,663
..market, match box factory,
theatre..

2007
02:27:25,203 --> 02:27:27,763
He has spoiled everything
by pledging and selling.

2008
02:27:28,339 --> 02:27:30,432
That all came into the hands
of this Nerappal family.

2009
02:27:31,209 --> 02:27:35,441
One fine day we ran away from
here after losing everything.

2010
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:39,909
After that, because of shame,
my father committed suicide.

2011
02:27:43,454 --> 02:27:46,423
The pain is in my mind since then.

2012
02:27:47,558 --> 02:27:48,252
Yes.

2013
02:27:48,726 --> 02:27:52,628
l don't need to cry for the property which
we lost because of my father's inability.

2014
02:27:53,164 --> 02:27:58,192
Justice is on Nerappal family's side.
But this is my land.

2015
02:27:58,736 --> 02:27:59,964
My property.

2016
02:28:00,504 --> 02:28:03,530
l will play any dirty games
for getting that.

2017
02:28:05,309 --> 02:28:09,473
For getting that, l started my game
by acting as a master in that school..

2018
02:28:11,249 --> 02:28:12,876
..for splitting father and son.

2019
02:28:13,084 --> 02:28:17,544
When l was thinking about where to start
that's the time l thought about you.

2020
02:28:21,692 --> 02:28:25,059
The love which l felt for you
at first sight.

2021
02:28:25,763 --> 02:28:26,889
Your presence.

2022
02:28:27,765 --> 02:28:29,392
Your touch.

2023
02:28:31,269 --> 02:28:33,897
Really, l was enjoying it.

2024
02:28:37,608 --> 02:28:43,513
When l came to know that you are
the girl in Paappi's heart.

2025
02:28:43,814 --> 02:28:48,080
lt's my brain behind you to contest
against Paappi in the elections

2026
02:28:48,619 --> 02:28:51,679
and l had stabbed him that time.
But, it flopped.

2027
02:28:53,124 --> 02:28:56,423
l never let any opportunity go
which l got later on.

2028
02:28:58,029 --> 02:28:59,758
From there onwards,
l started succeeding.

2029
02:29:00,865 --> 02:29:04,801
For cancelling your marriage..

2030
02:29:07,571 --> 02:29:10,665
Annie is the bride of this Nerappal Paappi.
Understood?

2031
02:29:12,476 --> 02:29:13,773
That, too, me.

2032
02:29:20,318 --> 02:29:23,344
Poor Paappi. His bad times
started from then onwards.

2033
02:29:24,655 --> 02:29:25,121
Yes.

2034
02:29:26,490 --> 02:29:32,895
When everybody was enjoying
the happiness of throwing..

2035
02:29:33,397 --> 02:29:37,231
..Paappi out of the school,
that time the school caught fire.

2036
02:29:40,938 --> 02:29:43,406
This poor Dasan master did that, too.

2037
02:29:48,346 --> 02:29:51,907
When l told you that this
Dasan master had seen..

2038
02:29:52,450 --> 02:29:54,475
..Paappi running away after litting fire to school
you and his father believed that.

2039
02:29:54,685 --> 02:29:57,483
That was enough for
father and son to split.

2040
02:29:58,522 --> 02:30:01,650
The market of lttirikandam.

2041
02:30:01,859 --> 02:30:06,319
l sent my business partner
Manichan for getting that back.

2042
02:30:07,999 --> 02:30:11,435
He is notjust my partner only.
He is like my brother.

2043
02:30:11,702 --> 02:30:15,570
lf l couldn't fulfill his wishes,
then how can l call myself a man?

2044
02:30:16,540 --> 02:30:20,943
When l was to reach my aim,
that time you came with a diary.

2045
02:30:21,145 --> 02:30:23,511
Your grandmother's co-operative society.

2046
02:30:23,714 --> 02:30:25,181
Then how would Dasan get peaceful sleep?

2047
02:30:28,052 --> 02:30:29,349
When you called me,

2048
02:30:30,187 --> 02:30:34,021
that time itself l decided that l had to
put an end to everything today itself.

2049
02:30:34,725 --> 02:30:38,354
That night itself,
l stabbed Mathai on the road.

2050
02:30:43,100 --> 02:30:45,625
Mathai. Mathai.

2051
02:31:00,751 --> 02:31:01,376
No.

2052
02:31:02,887 --> 02:31:05,913
Come fast. Come fast.
Come fast. Save.

2053
02:31:13,264 --> 02:31:16,392
Mother. Come fast. Come fast.

2054
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:25,500
Only one witness saw stabbing Mathai.
Shashankan.

2055
02:31:25,810 --> 02:31:28,176
He ruined everything.
l won't leave him.

2056
02:31:30,314 --> 02:31:32,612
Now, my people would've finished him.

2057
02:31:33,317 --> 02:31:35,785
Thus one more new case on Paappi's head.

2058
02:31:37,321 --> 02:31:41,121
Now onwards, Paappi's time
is the best time.

2059
02:31:42,660 --> 02:31:46,460
Poor Mathai won't come out of the hospital.

2060
02:31:47,164 --> 02:31:52,124
l have bribed people including the police.

2061
02:31:54,839 --> 02:32:00,038
l am going to enjoy the
property which Paappi has.

2062
02:32:01,479 --> 02:32:06,644
l have brought Annie teacher here
for inaugurating that. Right, Mani?

2063
02:32:09,053 --> 02:32:11,817
Yes. You are Paappi's girl.

2064
02:32:12,223 --> 02:32:15,124
Paappi got the credit of getting
the teacher's heart.

2065
02:32:15,392 --> 02:32:19,488
Then this master gets the credit
of atleast touching your body.

2066
02:32:20,097 --> 02:32:21,257
What you are saying, teacher?

2067
02:32:22,833 --> 02:32:23,822
Come children.

2068
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:38,007
Take your hand off, idiot.

2069
02:32:39,717 --> 02:32:42,185
You know what's the biggest
strength of a lady is?

2070
02:32:43,320 --> 02:32:44,753
A man is there for her.

2071
02:32:46,090 --> 02:32:48,854
Yes. l am Paappi's girl.

2072
02:32:53,531 --> 02:32:56,557
For that, Paappi won't even see you.

2073
02:35:24,148 --> 02:35:27,675
lf you are Nerappal Mathai's son
then you thrash them.

2074
02:35:28,185 --> 02:35:29,777
Only after that you can come home.

2075
02:35:32,056 --> 02:35:35,025
Your father is saying this.
Thrash them.

2076
02:37:34,344 --> 02:37:35,140
No.

2077
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:39,571
You are not the person to
go to jail after killing him.

2078
02:37:40,417 --> 02:37:44,979
This father's desire to enjoy
life with you is not yet over.

2079
02:37:46,256 --> 02:37:47,814
l need you.

2080
02:37:53,197 --> 02:37:54,164
Leave him.

2081
02:37:54,431 --> 02:37:56,831
Jesus has the right to take one's life.

2082
02:38:01,104 --> 02:38:07,907
We offered a job for you after knowing that
you are son of Radhakrishna Kaimal.

2083
02:38:09,646 --> 02:38:10,908
One mistake we made.

2084
02:38:11,448 --> 02:38:15,009
We didn't notice you in between
the threats of Manikunju.

2085
02:38:17,387 --> 02:38:21,289
Now onwards your life is
gratitude of Nerappal family.

2086
02:38:24,361 --> 02:38:30,561
Don't come to lttirikandam village.
Understood?

2087
02:38:37,875 --> 02:38:38,705
Paappi.
- Father.

2088
02:38:54,024 --> 02:38:54,718
Paappi.

2089
02:38:56,360 --> 02:38:57,793
Can you please let me be with you?

2090
02:38:58,128 --> 02:39:00,460
l too started loving this father
by accompanying him.

2091
02:39:01,365 --> 02:39:02,798
Let's think about it.
Right, Father?

2092
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:07,232
Yes. That's enough.
But l am joining now itself.

2093
02:39:09,339 --> 02:39:11,807
Paappi.
- Father.

2094
02:39:12,276 --> 02:39:14,904
Hey, Paappi.
- Yes, Father.

2095
02:39:15,112 --> 02:39:19,845
Whom does Paappi like more?
Mother or father?

2096
02:39:22,619 --> 02:39:27,079
Anniekutty.
- Hi. l escaped.

2097
02:39:27,291 --> 02:39:29,691
Now onwards, he will see only
good omen in his house.

2098
02:39:57,621 --> 02:40:01,682
Paappi.
- Father.

2099
02:40:02,225 --> 02:40:06,753
Paappi.
- Father.

2100
02:40:06,964 --> 02:40:11,025
Paappi.
- Hey, father.

2101
02:40:11,234 --> 02:40:16,171
Oh, Paappi.
- Hey, Father.

2102
02:40:16,373 --> 02:40:20,776
" Father, dust, wind and liquor is there.''
"Holy spirit.''

2103
02:40:20,978 --> 02:40:25,108
" lf beats, it breaks.''
"Small duck.''

2104
02:40:25,649 --> 02:40:28,618
" Dinner at night.''

2105
02:40:30,253 --> 02:40:33,950
" lf curry is there, liquor, too, is good.''
