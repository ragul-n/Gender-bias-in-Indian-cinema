1
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,398
The inevitable always happens

2
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,068
Sorry sir, you were saying something

3
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,838
No doubts about your alacrity,
But the inevitable always happens

4
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,654
You were saying something
about my alacrity

5
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:17,690
All these security officers I've seen... make me wonder...

6
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,265
whether you are men or machines

7
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,043
He doesn’t understand Hindi, does he?

8
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,218
No sir

9
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:51,895
Ever wondered? In the Indian
subcontinent... our part of Asia...

10
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,466
how many presidents... how many prime ministers...

11
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,570
have been killed
in the last 50 years?

12
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,805
In our own country,
Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi

13
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:08,775
In Bangladesh, Mujibur Rahman,
In Sri Lanka, Premdasa

14
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,514
In Pakistan, Zia-ur-Rehman

15
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,265
The next name on this hit list
is our Prime Minister

16
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:32,994
I am here gathering evidence, names,
of those behind the entire conspiracy

17
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:39,578
Diplomacy was just a ruse,
The evidence is in a little floppy

18
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,181
I´ll hand it over to you
when we reach the hotel

19
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:47,717
If something happens to me, you will
hand it over to the Prime Minister

20
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:58,205
This 2-inch y 2-inch floppy is more
precious than your life or mine

21
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,741
No one dies

22
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,447
No one kills

23
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,048
Not I ..

24
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,056
I´m not the one who´s saying that

25
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,060
It´s there, written in the Gita

26
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:44,729
I am merely a tool

27
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,073
´Tool, merely

28
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,115
In this game of puppetry...

29
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,774
I am the hunter...

30
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,982
you are my prey

31
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,658
what´s in a face?

32
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:20,795
´What is in a face? Mere happenstance... that you are a Manu Verma...

33
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,375
and I a Raghavan

34
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,046
Therefore...

35
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,935
please, not to mind

36
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,394
Good is bad
bad is good...

37
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,665
in the false light,
it´s all true

38
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:35,712
´True-False, who knows what?
One´s a lesser evil than the other

39
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:41,042
But they all look-walk the same,
it all seems to measure the same

40
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:46,217
Set fire to Truth,
find a Lie burnt out

41
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,054
Good is bad
bad is good...

42
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,057
in the false light,
it´s all true

43
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,330
Black is black,
black as Death

44
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,946
But life´s a kaleidoscope of colours,
to be diced, piece by piece

45
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:12,985
´What´s unborn of sin,
in sin is bred

46
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,389
Dregs spat out,
breed hunger

47
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:34,666
´What was, is no more believed,
what the eye beholds, is unbelievable

48
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:40,043
what was all pervading...
no longer dwells on this earth

49
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:45,212
´Trust your instincts,
it´s ugly

50
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,046
Once what bred
in every festering wound...

51
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,553
is no more, nowhere,
you´re told

52
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,859
Good is bad
bad is good...

53
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,259
in the false light,
it´s all true

54
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,795
I stopped your transfer orders
on grounds of lapses in the...

55
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,229
Defence Minister´s security detail,
Home Ministry says, you want to see me

56
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,996
In private

57
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,553
This file contains whatever the
late Defence Minister had to tell me

58
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,817
But the floppy containing the details
which he wanted to give me...

59
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,930
isn´t yet in my possession

60
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,938
Your name is the next on the hit list

61
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,971
´Who is behind it, we can know only
from the Defence Minister´s assassin

62
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,884
According to this note... this information...

63
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,988
ought to remain only between
you and me?

64
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:35,153
Because your staff is not beyond
the pale of suspicion, sir

65
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,036
Anytime, Anywhere

66
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,673
Mahadev, wash your hands

67
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,934
I won´t

68
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,777
Mahadev, wash your hands

69
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:30,983
No...

70
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,987
I won´t

71
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,793
Don´t wash

72
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,897
Don´t

73
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:31,903
No, I will

74
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:36,174
You won´t?
- I will

75
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,245
You won´t,
- I won´t

76
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,181
I will

77
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,047
where´s Raghavan?

78
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,458
One minute

79
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,191
Please hold

80
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:58,967
I ..

81
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,969
don´t hold

82
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,776
Yakub goes on hold for no one

83
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,577
I´ll wash

84
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,049
One minute

85
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:58,458
You killed the defence minister,
You got a big price

86
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,665
won´t you give a piece
of the pie to Yakub?

87
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,370
Threatening me?
- Not threat

88
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,509
Tax

89
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,000
Brother sends

90
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,772
Brother sends

91
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,109
A joker?

92
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,066
No one gets killed

93
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,069
No one kills

94
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,340
I´m not the one who´s saying that

95
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,944
It´s there, written in the Gita

96
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,850
I am merely a tool

97
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,871
In this game of puppetry...

98
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:38,840
I am the killer...

99
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,705
you are a corpse

100
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,317
Not to mind

101
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,721
Not to mind

102
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:12,943
Tax

103
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,985
Make sure no one´s left out

104
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,892
You´ve sent the jeep to the airport?
- Yes... if the flight isn´t late...

105
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,495
he should be arriving anytime

106
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,499
Don´t touch anything
until Manu arrives

107
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,995
what´s for breakfast?

108
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,041
I don´t see the purpose
in transferring you...

109
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:47,543
from vlP security to Crime Branch,
- Just missing you

110
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,609
Me? Or thieves... robbers and murderers?
- Pradhan... don´t assume...

111
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,514
you woke me out of my sleep and hauled
me overnight from Delhi for no reason?

112
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,390
what´s this?
- Piece of rubber

113
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,725
Found at the place of crime

114
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,739
Often used for making masks
for films

115
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:20,977
Rameez was Yeda Yakub´s chauffeur,
an underworld collector

116
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,982
Your underworld types
have interesting names

117
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,651
Same with Yeda Yakub´s throat,
Same modus operandi

118
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,256
Corpse is in the health club, Upstairs

119
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,995
Looks like gang war, Pradhan,
You called me from Delhi for this?

120
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:44,893
´The assassin himself sent me a message,
to have you called in, Urgently

121
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,666
Message?

122
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,705
with a signature

123
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,660
Killing isn´t only his calling,
Pastime too, looks like

124
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,932
One who leaves his signature
on his work is no simple killer

125
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,945
He´s challenging us,
catch me if you dare

126
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:34,884
I´m getting Supriya and Gita over here... Strange! For all my invitations...

127
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,887
you never found the opportunity... and now for the sake of an assassin...

128
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,991
you´re ready to move en famille?

129
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:48,796
Friends can be refused, Pradhan,
Not foes

130
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:56,705
How much longer?
- Here he comes

131
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,067
I can´t see the connection
between the two murders

132
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:59,700
But the modus operandi is the same,
- Who might be his quarry now?

133
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,770
Still at work? If you will bring
the office to the dining table...

134
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:12,714
I might send dinner to office, right?
- Only the cheeses, Not the kebabs

135
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,317
They´re great

136
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:24,790
Manu, don´t you sometimes get
the feeling that we married cooks?

137
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,721
And such pretty cooks

138
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,996
Why only cooks? Nurse... governess...

139
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,163
Gardener...
- Washerwoman

140
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,340
Secretary...
- Housekeeper...

141
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:40,705
Accountant, all rolled-into-one,
- All-in-one, let´s eat

142
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,044
where are the kids?

143
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,379
These cartoons and video games
are for little kids, I hate it

144
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:57,858
But Mummy thinks I´m mad about these,
like other kids

145
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:03,997
´You know Dipu, scientists
have found a new solar system

146
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:12,576
Just imagine, a whole new Sun!
It´s planets

147
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,709
Maybe even people will be there,
- Yes! Also Shah Rukh Khan

148
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,954
why didn´t Manu marry all these years?
- That´s what my father asked him...

149
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,285
when he went to ask for my hand,
You know what he said?

150
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,051
what...?
- Guess

151
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,465
Maybe he never found the right girl?
- No

152
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,659
Then...?
- He said... he forgot

153
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,267
He forgot to marry?
- He forgot

154
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,115
That line you´ve never heard

155
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,118
My father is so serious,
Even he broke out laughing

156
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:03,150
How did you win him over?
- He was in love too

157
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:08,722
But he never dared, Because my father
was his senior, And I was in college

158
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:15,865
But I had decided, That gave him
the confidence to woo my father

159
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,910
Pradhan... our kids are either
growing up too fast...

160
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,545
or maybe we just notice
things too late

161
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,606
´Yes, they are growing up,
But in what conditions?

162
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:35,049
The situation is going from bad to
worse... feel scared telling him...

163
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,959
about honesty and integrity... am I
making him too weak to face...

164
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:43,295
the world that is to come about?
In the coming times of hypocrisy...

165
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:47,531
lies, dishonesty, cold-bloodedness,
will he be able to survive?

166
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:53,509
Sometimes, I feel like retiring
and going back to the village

167
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:01,209
You can retire from a job... not from
life... it´s the coming times...

168
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:08,316
´that we´re fighting for,
- Still, of late I miss my village

169
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:14,995
Particularly, the rains,
- Let´s make it someday, together

170
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:17,996
To watch the rains in the village

171
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,605
I've put the word out to my informers... in the underworld...

172
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,182
things like this don´t stay hidden

173
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,911
So what stays hidden?
Tell us some too

174
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,056
what´s in the tiffin box?
Dipu hasn´t eaten?

175
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:43,925
Everyone has eaten, This is
for me and this one

176
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,729
´The two of them are locked in battle,
- Oh yes, they aren´t getting married

177
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,838
Good night, Mister Forgot

178
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:02,945
Forgot...?

179
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,176
Got it?

180
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,782
Come over,
- Sure

181
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,399
Are boys really such fools?

182
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,003
Had I been a fool, would your Mummy
have married me?

183
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,199
who knows? I wasn´t even born then

184
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,012
This night

185
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,849
Is mine

186
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,047
Like the lizard, it crawls

187
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,224
Like rolling Death´s dice...

188
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,637
It swallows... it devours...
this black... venomos night

189
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:11,975
Blink... you will miss the link
this complicated night

190
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:17,310
From silence it draws its might...
this night that moves

191
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,970
Isolation... it´s isolation

192
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:20,437
Your heart will forever be lonely...
it´s crazy

193
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:42,797
Every person is a ruin...

194
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:47,002
every heart isolates
another

195
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,778
It stuns... it strikes...
this night of Death´s rolling dice

196
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:12,983
The night turns darker suddenly...

197
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:17,992
my veil will slip out of his hands

198
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,048
´They´re ashore;
and yet they drown

199
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:44,377
It´s the night that
brings the storm

200
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:55,930
On bare bodies that speak...
this is night that simmers

201
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,845
I know who you are

202
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,104
who are you?

203
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,918
Your assassin

204
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,243
Any last wishes?

205
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:34,252
Only too die, nothing else

206
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:46,066
You got a last wish?
- Only you, No other wish

207
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:20,327
How have you been Hanif-Brother?
- All by your grace

208
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:35,052
who killed Yeda Yakub?

209
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:44,727
You are asking too big a price
for saving my life once

210
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,797
Name

211
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,392
when did you start smoking?

212
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,061
Raghavan

213
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:56,860
Dog gets card

214
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:05,235
Dog, goes for the card

215
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:29,388
Mahadev-Brother, dog goes
fetches card

216
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,501
Fetches card

217
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,799
Fetches

218
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,506
Dog goes...
- Fetches card

219
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,769
won´t even die!

220
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,708
Fetches card, Dog fetch card

221
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,052
Dog fetch card

222
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:01,924
Dog fetches card

223
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,070
we´re playing another game

224
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,770
One...
- Two

225
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,772
Three...
- Four

226
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:16,636
Eighty...
- Ninety

227
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,777
Count till...
- A full hundred

228
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,985
Have you counted...
- Till a hundred?

229
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,977
There´s the thief...
- Getting away

230
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:04,927
In all, 18 Raghavans,
6 in lock-ups, serving life

231
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:11,731
10 ordinary criminals,
One in death row, awaiting hanging

232
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,732
That leaves one,
what about him?

233
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:18,136
1983, Age 1 1

234
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,708
She used to work, like me,
Raghu asked for money

235
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:25,983
She refused. He burnt her alive

236
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,451
Burnt his own mother alive

237
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:35,248
Age 16, from remand home to
Arthur Road jail, warden´s murder

238
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:43,998
Mr Deshmukh was a religious man,
He tried reading the Gita to the boys

239
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,997
To reform them, Raghavan took
Gita lessons, But

240
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:50,233
No one dies

241
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:51,898
No one kills

242
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:54,840
I´m not the one who´s saying that,
it´s there, written in your Gita

243
00:46:56,414 --> 00:47:01,579
1990, Age 18

244
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,657
Jailbreak, Missing ever since,
- Anyone else in the family?

245
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,119
An only brother, was

246
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,923
´That Madhavan? Poor fellow, he was mad

247
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:32,314
Live till you can

248
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,398
No one dies

249
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,039
No one kills

250
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:20,793
I´ll get an ambulance

251
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,849
Raining, back home in the village

252
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,160
No one dies

253
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,996
No one kills

254
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:26,995
´You are a soul, you aren´t born,
you don´t die

255
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:44,515
As one discards used clothes
for the new

256
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:56,328
Only form changes,
faces change

257
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,941
´That, which we know as Death, is Life

258
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:10,545
Of late I miss my village

259
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,311
Particularly, the rains

260
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:28,520
How are you related to Raghavan?
- As woman to man

261
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:29,926
Husband or lover?

262
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,164
Killer

263
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:40,809
what else do you know about Raghavan?
- It´s beyond my comprehension...

264
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:46,038
why the police is interested
in what I know of Raghavan

265
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,943
Answer the question

266
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,929
I didn´t ask that,
- You asked me what I know of him

267
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:05,725
´What he does, where he goes, who he
meets, address, means of livelihood

268
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:15,101
Raghavan never asked my age,
I never asked his income

269
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,647
we never wasted time
over silly questions

270
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,989
Do I still have to tell you
what kind of business?

271
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,986
That´s apparent

272
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:39,230
I know what you want to know from me... what you don´t know is...

273
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:43,772
you´re wasting your time,
- You think you´re very smart?

274
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:47,038
Raghavan thinks I´m beautiful too

275
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:49,878
No...?

276
00:55:56,587 --> 00:56:02,583
But I don´t know of too many girls
who´d care for a killer´s adulation

277
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:08,924
´Yes, he might wash his bloody hands
before he touches you

278
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:16,437
The expensive gifts he buys for you
are bloodstained

279
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:26,976
I don´t know which Raghavan you´re
referring to... the Raghavan I know...

280
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:29,379
slakes my thirst with his fire

281
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,788
Have you ever used fire
to slake your thirst, officer?

282
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:50,896
If you want... you can make life
easier for me... if I want...

283
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,601
I can make life difficult for you,
I want Raghavan

284
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:00,647
As much as I knew,
I've told you

285
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,923
If you don´t say, Narang will,
- Was I called here for time-pass?

286
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:19,731
No, my interrogation continues

287
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:30,710
´The question isn´t where Raghavan is,
Question is whether you know, or not

288
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,147
Question isn´t whether
you will divulge

289
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,993
Answer is, I know how
to make you talk

290
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:56,057
No one dies, no one kills

291
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,993
You´re gone

292
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,063
You too

293
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:43,951
I´m Arjun Srivastav, I've been deputed
in Mr Pradhan´s place

294
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:49,725
I needn´t have been sent to
wrap up the rest of the case

295
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:55,061
Any clerk can do it,
- I see

296
01:03:55,865 --> 01:04:03,931
Using an academy-topper for a cook
is a waste of talent, And why waste?

297
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:07,101
I'd say, it´s an insult

298
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:13,647
Had you called me in before
Raghavan was nabbed...

299
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:20,450
I'd show you what Arjun Srivastav is,
I've majored in criminal psychology

300
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,992
Raghavan would´ve been in jail
in two days

301
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,997
So you´ve been sent
to take Pradhan´s place?

302
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:31,600
what to do? Had to come,
- Be seated

303
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:35,994
List the names of people
you´ve shot till date

304
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,604
I haven´t shot anyone... At least the names...

305
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:49,480
of those you´ve arrested,
- I haven´t arrested anyone

306
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:53,852
I've just passed out of the academy,
- And you come to take Pradhan´s place?

307
01:04:55,258 --> 01:05:01,163
Pradhan had more scars on his body than
the number of years in your age

308
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:07,835
You´ve majored in criminal psychology?
In one of the dark... dank alleys...

309
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:11,872
if you come across a Raghavan, he won´t
quiz you about criminal psychology

310
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:16,945
He will tear you to pieces... far more difficult than nabbing him...

311
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:24,781
´will be holding Raghavan behind
the bars, and it´s nearly not to be

312
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:32,323
The police officer´s job isn´t over
until crime is stamped out

313
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:39,996
In your place... Pradhan wouldn´t have
let anyone breathe in peace...

314
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:44,333
not you, not I
until Raghavan hanged

315
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:20,304
After killing the Defence Minister,
you took a floppy

316
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:32,977
You´re a small cog in the wheels of
a huge conspiracy... your role was...

317
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:37,991
smaller than the bullets which killed
the Defence Minister... but you know...

318
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:43,827
which finger pulled the trigger... whose the gun it was...

319
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:48,936
and the hand that ordered the gun... and the hand behind that hand...

320
01:06:49,072 --> 01:06:54,840
you surely know this much?
- I´m an assassin, Not a traitor

321
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:04,577
In my business, the client´s name
isn´t divulged, At no cost

322
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:14,496
At least... you know...?
You´re sure to hang

323
01:07:16,299 --> 01:07:20,429
Tell me where the floppy is,
You might be let off lightly

324
01:07:34,484 --> 01:07:36,452
Two sides of the coin

325
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:39,989
Good and bad

326
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:43,384
Pretty and ugly

327
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:48,262
´We need each other, Manu Verma

328
01:07:53,036 --> 01:07:55,004
we´ll meet in the office

329
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:57,636
Supriya...

330
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:06,505
Isn´t that your wife´s name?
She´s pretty

331
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:11,976
Had you not been here now, you´d be
in her arms right now, no?

332
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:28,165
You aren´t a bad fellow,
You´re a demon

333
01:08:30,073 --> 01:08:35,705
You are where you are because it´s
dangerous for society to let you live

334
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:37,709
wrong

335
01:08:39,082 --> 01:08:40,379
Absolutely wrong

336
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:47,854
I am where I am because society
doesn´t want to see it´s own face

337
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:52,960
Society doesn´t have the guts
to admit that...

338
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:55,462
one of society´s faces
is Raghavan too

339
01:08:56,132 --> 01:09:05,097
Abolish laws, set men free, And every
Manu Verma might become a Raghavan

340
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:10,473
Because every Manu Verma wants
to become a Raghavan

341
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,648
No Raghavan inside this Manu Verma

342
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:20,716
And till this Manu Verma is alive,
no Raghavan can stay alive

343
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:29,829
Look Raghavan... in a very short while...

344
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:34,663
you´ll be wearing a black hood

345
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:41,601
And that nasty laugh of yours
will be buried forever

346
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:48,615
A noose goes around your neck, Suddenly,
the ground beneath your feet slips away

347
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:52,710
And you´re swinging in a hole blacker
than the blackest of your crimes

348
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:57,454
Noose tightens... tightens

349
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:05,599
´You´ll blabber, your lungs will fight
to breathe, but not a breath

350
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,834
First of all... your heart...

351
01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:11,665
stops

352
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:14,876
Then your brain will stop working

353
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:22,445
And then you, Raghavan,
will be gone for good

354
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:33,392
Felt nice

355
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,327
Felt very nice

356
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:45,666
It´s going to be just the way
you enjoyed telling me about it

357
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:54,677
But Manu Verma, one thing never ends

358
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:05,860
There´s something that´ll never end

359
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:10,992
See you at that gallows

360
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,240
There´s something that never ends

361
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,003
Thus it is proven that
the accused killed...

362
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:54,906
´the Defence Minister, Yeda Yakub,
Rameez and Pradhan

363
01:11:55,711 --> 01:12:00,774
I pray that the court to pronounce the
harshest sentence for Raghavan Ghatge

364
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:09,988
In view of evidence and
depositions by witnesses...

365
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:20,796
Raghavan Ghatge son of Sadanand Ghatge
is sentenced to hang until death

366
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,832
That´s all there is to your law?

367
01:13:01,344 --> 01:13:07,772
If I am to hang, does it make
any difference who hangs me?

368
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:11,648
´Your hangman, or I myself´

369
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:17,849
´This is a court, Raghavan,
this is my court

370
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:23,989
I won´t allow you to ridicule my court,
Take this animal out of the court

371
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:30,561
I´m an animal? And you are human just
because you carry that wooden hammer?

372
01:13:33,476 --> 01:13:35,000
why...

373
01:13:37,647 --> 01:13:40,047
do you think your decision
is the last word?

374
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:45,451
Outside this city lies a vast
jungle, Justice Chowdhury

375
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:53,055
where the darkness reigns... in that court...

376
01:13:55,765 --> 01:14:00,464
one day, you will stand
where I stand today

377
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:06,333
And I´ll be where
you are sitting

378
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:19,546
Until then, stay imprisoned in your
black cloak and await your trial

379
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:38,898
If life takes away,
so it gives too, I´m fine

380
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,057
In school to catch a thief?

381
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:00,823
Got good news for you,
- Nabbed another thief?

382
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:07,929
we´re going to see Granny
during the holidays

383
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,933
´This time, we´re going,
- I don´t believe this

384
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,106
Just make sure you buy tickets
for Gita and myself

385
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:16,710
´What will you be doing here, Papa?
- Vanquishing the evil

386
01:15:32,595 --> 01:15:36,395
Go away, Evil

387
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:41,402
Lord Ram has a bow and arrows

388
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:45,506
Get lost

389
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:10,261
Evil has many lives,
Evil is wiser

390
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:19,972
Go to your City of Evil

391
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:26,971
Go home and boast

392
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:37,390
You don´t know The Evil´s powers

393
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:42,589
The world will be vanquished

394
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:50,400
You will be crushed

395
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,909
You will be stamped out

396
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:12,928
You talk too much

397
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,938
I´m going to abduct you

398
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,240
Then I shall wait for the Redeemer

399
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:43,791
Evil! You are but Evil!

400
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:47,553
Do not brag... you are not bigger
than the Redeemer

401
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:57,370
I´ll set to fire your empire
with my tail

402
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:00,940
Remember... you´re female...
- Okay

403
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:04,145
I´ll set afire your
Golden City of Sin

404
01:18:04,914 --> 01:18:12,787
´You have abducted Sita,
I´m going to tell Ram

405
01:18:16,759 --> 01:18:21,594
How will you cross the seas?
You will drown

406
01:18:23,566 --> 01:18:30,529
´The City of Sin is far away,
no phones are not working

407
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:53,522
O´Redeemer, use the e-mail,
inform my Ram quickly

408
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:19,715
Let´s fight a war

409
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:21,649
´Yes, let´s fight

410
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:25,990
Let the world be cleansed of sin

411
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:32,330
´The City of Sin
will thrive forever

412
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:37,172
Evil will thrive
as long as virtue lives

413
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:50,051
Evil will thrive

414
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,667
who are you?

415
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:22,040
Your killer

416
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:27,656
Any last wish?

417
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:33,586
´When you are with me,
I have no wishes

418
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:53,857
If you have come to see me at
the gates of Death... the purpose...

419
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:56,971
must be more precious than my death,
- Right, Your life

420
01:22:58,874 --> 01:23:02,970
Here´s your pardon,
with the President´s signature

421
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:09,979
Tell me where the floppy is, Death
will be commuted to life, Look

422
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:19,824
You´re here to strike a deal?
- I´m giving life...

423
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:23,464
to a convict like you,
How can it come for free?

424
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:28,602
In my business, the client´s name
isn´t divulged, whatever the price

425
01:23:31,073 --> 01:23:39,037
The price isn´t money,
it´s life. You know what life means?

426
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:45,850
Just now... when you met Nita
for the last time...

427
01:23:45,988 --> 01:23:48,889
when you held her hand... when you felt her heartbeat...

428
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:53,061
her eyes... her lips...

429
01:23:55,097 --> 01:23:58,555
it can all be yours, Not now,
ten years on, But you can have her

430
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,942
No one knows anything about this deal

431
01:24:10,913 --> 01:24:14,781
Apart from the Prime Minister
and myself, no one knows anything

432
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,984
´Your last hope, I am

433
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,271
Look Raghavan...

434
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:45,475
the hangman is testing his ropes
with a dummy that weighs like you

435
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,641
The doctor and the magistrate must
be here, The doctor has seen you

436
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:53,278
He´s only waiting to certify your
corpse... the magistrate must be...

437
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:57,290
looking at his watch... he has to drop
his kids to school... the hangman...

438
01:24:57,426 --> 01:25:02,261
must be turning the hood inside out,
His wife might be at home

439
01:25:02,965 --> 01:25:04,933
He might be in a hurry too

440
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:17,243
After you´re hanged, everyone
will go back to their lives

441
01:25:19,381 --> 01:25:21,542
Only you won´t be here

442
01:25:23,085 --> 01:25:25,986
Life will be the same,
Only you won´t be

443
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:32,460
So...

444
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,192
tell me...

445
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:37,658
where the floppy is

446
01:25:40,035 --> 01:25:43,004
They´re coming

447
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:46,726
You can´t escape... you can´t!

448
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,920
Are you all right, sir?

449
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:43,991
No one kills

450
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:41,717
Sir, are you all right?

451
01:28:43,093 --> 01:28:43,957
what are you staring at?
Get an ambulance

452
01:28:57,474 --> 01:29:00,034
Since when did this hospital
start employing pretty nurses?

453
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:06,039
- When are you quitting the job?
- First thing, once I´m out

454
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:10,520
Lies!
- Then why ask me?

455
01:29:11,589 --> 01:29:15,116
I can´t even ask you why
this show of chivalry?

456
01:29:15,726 --> 01:29:17,489
Listen Supriya, Raghavan is dead

457
01:29:19,263 --> 01:29:21,925
Nothing´s over, There´ll be
someone else in Raghavan´s place

458
01:29:22,533 --> 01:29:24,899
How is Gita?
- Don´t you try to digress

459
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:33,840
Supriya, this is a battle to be fought,
in my place, someone else...

460
01:29:34,011 --> 01:29:39,176
In your place someone else
- So easy to say, so nice to hear

461
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:43,418
But no once cares for the one who
suffers it! What do you think?

462
01:29:43,687 --> 01:29:46,417
This life is only yours?
You´re forgetting

463
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:51,357
Two other lives are tied to yours,
You life´s ours too

464
01:29:51,929 --> 01:29:54,022
And you´ve no right
to endanger it

465
01:29:58,402 --> 01:30:01,132
For my husband, my child, my family,
I will be selfish

466
01:30:02,072 --> 01:30:05,371
And no one takes that right
away from me, Not even you

467
01:30:16,287 --> 01:30:17,515
How´s Gita?

468
01:30:26,497 --> 01:30:28,556
She´ll come to see you on her way
back from school

469
01:30:33,604 --> 01:30:35,037
She has sent a card for you

470
01:30:40,344 --> 01:30:43,108
The Evil is vanquished,
the story is over

471
01:30:44,949 --> 01:30:47,918
But Sita's (my) test by fire pends.

472
01:31:35,599 --> 01:31:37,567
No one should find that briefcase

473
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,298
Narang´s release orders

474
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:38,288
Narang´s release orders,
- Put it here

475
01:34:31,208 --> 01:34:32,505
Take this

476
01:34:35,112 --> 01:34:36,511
Take it

477
01:34:37,648 --> 01:34:43,245
You stabbed me in the back,
Now stab me in the heart

478
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:46,550
Right away,
Sir, call for you

479
01:34:50,594 --> 01:34:52,221
Like this

480
01:34:54,031 --> 01:35:01,494
One, two, three, four,
count till a full five score

481
01:35:04,274 --> 01:35:05,502
Go on, play

482
01:35:06,543 --> 01:35:15,451
One... two... three... four...
- Count till a full five score

483
01:35:22,526 --> 01:35:23,959
You´re gone

484
01:36:02,799 --> 01:36:05,393
why did he have try to escape?
Had he known that...

485
01:36:05,535 --> 01:36:09,665
his release orders have arrived,
he might not have tried to escape

486
01:36:44,541 --> 01:36:46,168
What is the matter, Manu?

487
01:36:48,545 --> 01:36:52,003
Not the first time
you shot someone

488
01:36:53,283 --> 01:36:56,252
Neither was the man you shot,
a gentleman

489
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,054
But he wasn´t guilty

490
01:37:00,524 --> 01:37:06,019
You must´ve shot him in self-defence,
why get so worked up over it?

491
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:13,302
Just because I´m your husband
doesn´t mean whatever I do is right

492
01:37:15,305 --> 01:37:20,174
I wasn´t given the upbringing
to approve my husband´s every act

493
01:37:20,877 --> 01:37:22,970
I know... Then...?

494
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:32,455
Is it impossible that I did wrong?
- Yes, But I also know...

495
01:37:32,589 --> 01:37:36,719
that if ever, you´ll be
the first man to own up

496
01:37:43,433 --> 01:37:45,560
I feel I've killed an innocent man

497
01:37:47,738 --> 01:37:50,764
Consider that done,
Now what do you wish to do?

498
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:56,479
You want to go through life with
that guilt? Or do you wish to do...

499
01:37:56,613 --> 01:38:01,846
whatever is the next necessary step?
I´m with you in your every decision

500
01:38:02,586 --> 01:38:09,424
Because I know you can´t kill anyone
without reason, if the law...

501
01:38:09,593 --> 01:38:12,221
takes up case against you, I´ll find
a good lawyer to fight your case

502
01:38:12,596 --> 01:38:17,898
If you wish to carry the guilt all
your life, I´ll bear half your burden

503
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:30,012
I wish I could think so simplistically,
- Time to go to bed, not think

504
01:38:31,715 --> 01:38:33,182
Go to sleep

505
01:38:41,591 --> 01:38:42,785
Has Gita gone off to sleep?

506
01:38:44,261 --> 01:38:49,460
Nice seeing the old Manu in you again... I was apprehensive...

507
01:38:49,599 --> 01:38:51,567
that something has come over you

508
01:38:54,204 --> 01:38:57,970
In your eyes, there is a jungle

509
01:39:00,477 --> 01:39:02,502
I want to forget my sorrows
in your eyes

510
01:39:05,449 --> 01:39:10,819
I still can´t make out what makes
poets of husbands after midnight

511
01:39:12,589 --> 01:39:15,319
Not poet, Lovers

512
01:40:47,617 --> 01:40:48,743
who´s there?

513
01:40:49,653 --> 01:40:51,587
No one dies

514
01:40:54,658 --> 01:40:56,592
No one kills

515
01:41:04,334 --> 01:41:05,961
You´ve seen me in the mirror

516
01:41:07,504 --> 01:41:09,472
Raghavan now lives in Manu Verma

517
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,510
Manu Verma is Raghavan

518
01:41:43,607 --> 01:41:44,972
what happened?

519
01:42:06,930 --> 01:42:13,233
No Madhu, the gunfire wasn´t shocking,
it was the look in Manu´s eyes

520
01:42:13,703 --> 01:42:17,730
His eyes?
- He was like someone else

521
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:20,009
I don´t know what to do

522
01:42:21,044 --> 01:42:24,343
Apart from the Indian Prime Minister... heads of nuclear power states...

523
01:42:24,481 --> 01:42:29,885
will be present at the Mumbai meet
on nuclear disarmament

524
01:42:39,929 --> 01:42:42,124
Arjun Srivastav will assist you

525
01:43:04,587 --> 01:43:07,522
According to intelligence... Raghavan took the contract...

526
01:43:07,691 --> 01:43:09,625
for assassinating
the prime minister

527
01:44:11,054 --> 01:44:14,114
Dried, dead leaves

528
01:44:17,193 --> 01:44:22,495
But they travel to the roots,
to be born again as new leaves

529
01:44:25,335 --> 01:44:29,669
Nothing dies, only changes form,

530
01:44:30,673 --> 01:44:34,905
what´s happening to me is beyond
my comprehension... I find myself...

531
01:44:35,044 --> 01:44:41,506
helpless, confused, I don´t know
what to believe, what not to

532
01:44:42,919 --> 01:44:54,558
If you think I can give you a talisman... or perform rituals to set things right...

533
01:44:58,067 --> 01:45:01,969
She´s getting me wrong,
- Then tell me, what am I to do?

534
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:09,240
Nothing is more powerful
than your faith, your love

535
01:45:12,549 --> 01:45:17,851
No power in the world is greater,
It will protect you

536
01:45:21,391 --> 01:45:26,488
´What you have lost,
you will surely retrieve

537
01:47:20,109 --> 01:47:25,911
´The night comes,
the night goes

538
01:47:26,549 --> 01:47:35,890
Unfaithful, the night
comes, goes away

539
01:47:40,129 --> 01:47:48,901
´Yet, she returns to darken
my home, stealthily

540
01:48:43,026 --> 01:48:51,559
Ask the night... she has
a tale to tell...

541
01:49:07,683 --> 01:49:16,489
of old wounds that
will never heal

542
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:26,495
Has she a grief hidden away
in her heart?

543
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:37,506
It is a grief she nurtures
like a stolen jewel

544
01:49:38,081 --> 01:49:51,552
´The night comes, goes,
she´s unfaithful

545
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:34,231
who is it?
- Used to be my question

546
01:50:43,513 --> 01:50:46,482
You...?
- Who?

547
01:50:50,653 --> 01:50:52,587
My killer

548
01:50:56,926 --> 01:51:00,362
Any last wish?

549
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:08,366
Death, nothing else

550
01:51:10,273 --> 01:51:16,508
You got any last wish?
- When you are with me...

551
01:51:19,549 --> 01:51:21,517
I have no wish

552
01:51:23,586 --> 01:51:25,520
what do you intend?

553
01:51:28,991 --> 01:51:30,219
Intention?

554
01:51:33,262 --> 01:51:34,559
Good intention

555
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:40,296
Raghu... you are...

556
01:51:49,512 --> 01:51:51,480
No one dies...

557
01:51:52,949 --> 01:51:54,576
no one kills

558
01:51:54,717 --> 01:51:56,810
But with my hands,
I took your ashes

559
01:51:56,986 --> 01:52:01,150
´The one who had to die, is dead

560
01:52:04,927 --> 01:52:09,796
´The one who had to live, lives on

561
01:52:13,603 --> 01:52:19,508
I told you, I'd return,
Told you, didn´t I..?

562
01:52:26,148 --> 01:52:29,117
You...? What are you doing
in my room?

563
01:52:34,824 --> 01:52:39,557
Don´t go by the facade,
Your eyes can be deceived

564
01:52:41,597 --> 01:52:44,157
Ask your heart

565
01:52:45,601 --> 01:52:47,569
You´ve killed Raghu,
what more do you want from me?

566
01:52:47,937 --> 01:52:54,001
I.. I am Raghu, Look

567
01:52:55,611 --> 01:52:58,239
Look at me... Raghu´s killer is Raghu...?

568
01:52:59,515 --> 01:53:04,509
´Try what you will to make me squeal,
but you´re getting nothing here

569
01:53:10,593 --> 01:53:14,689
Raghu hasn´t gone away,
Raghu is right here, with you

570
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:19,229
Everything that was Raghu´s
is with you

571
01:53:20,536 --> 01:53:26,168
´You, Mahadev, everything

572
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:47,358
Kill me and I won´t
be able to avenge myself

573
01:53:50,099 --> 01:53:54,559
It was tough getting inside
Manu Verma to destroy him

574
01:54:03,546 --> 01:54:05,309
Trust me

575
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:12,510
´The Raghu in my arms,
is Raghu´s killer?

576
01:54:14,523 --> 01:54:16,047
How am I to believe?

577
01:54:54,196 --> 01:54:55,959
Brother...?

578
01:55:03,672 --> 01:55:09,110
what happened to your face?

579
01:55:10,546 --> 01:55:12,309
Got old

580
01:55:13,549 --> 01:55:15,449
Got myself a new one

581
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,455
I have a thousand faces,
you made for me

582
01:55:23,526 --> 01:55:26,086
Brother... brother´s back

583
01:55:36,405 --> 01:55:38,498
where are my ashes?

584
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:24,779
"Come into my cave"

585
01:57:36,492 --> 01:57:39,017
"Do your sin"

586
01:58:36,085 --> 01:58:38,053
"Face beneath faces..."

587
01:58:38,287 --> 01:58:40,551
"cover faces"

588
01:58:40,756 --> 01:58:42,849
"It´s all a facade"

589
01:58:43,592 --> 01:58:46,026
"Facade sells"

590
01:59:19,528 --> 01:59:21,826
"Do your sin"

591
01:59:29,238 --> 01:59:32,503
"Come into my cave"

592
02:00:04,907 --> 02:00:06,875
"Let the spasm rise"

593
02:00:07,276 --> 02:00:09,403
"Let the longing linger"

594
02:00:09,745 --> 02:00:14,512
"Let souls burn
in the dark of night"

595
02:00:38,841 --> 02:00:41,810
"Look into my eyes"

596
02:00:43,612 --> 02:00:46,911
"Suffer me"

597
02:00:48,383 --> 02:00:51,011
"Do your sin"

598
02:00:58,227 --> 02:01:01,128
"Come into my cave"

599
02:01:56,051 --> 02:01:59,179
I killed you,
you killed me

600
02:02:07,863 --> 02:02:09,558
It´s your wife,
I´ll be outside

601
02:02:12,734 --> 02:02:16,101
Yes,
- Where were you all night?

602
02:02:26,548 --> 02:02:28,015
what do you mean?

603
02:02:30,052 --> 02:02:31,519
You know...

604
02:02:34,857 --> 02:02:36,552
duty comes first

605
02:02:38,594 --> 02:02:40,391
Then the wife

606
02:02:40,596 --> 02:02:46,728
Does duty make you forget? This day,
ten years ago, whom did you marry?

607
02:02:47,603 --> 02:02:54,907
If you´re late tonight, you´re
choosing between duty and beauty

608
02:02:55,611 --> 02:03:01,846
Tonight, I can even give up my duty,
but not you

609
02:03:04,486 --> 02:03:08,718
Be ready, we´re going out

610
02:03:13,295 --> 02:03:19,097
Raghavan´s history sheet,
I´ll regret not having killed him

611
02:03:20,535 --> 02:03:22,503
He´s history now

612
02:04:24,533 --> 02:04:25,898
why don´t you talk?

613
02:04:26,535 --> 02:04:27,502
Coward

614
02:05:40,142 --> 02:05:43,305
Case Number 203A, Raghavan versus
Justice Chowdhury

615
02:05:43,545 --> 02:05:47,003
Justice Chowdhury is accused
of premeditating Raghavan´s murder

616
02:05:51,586 --> 02:05:53,451
This case has been decided

617
02:05:53,622 --> 02:05:57,956
Justice Chowdhury has been
sentenced to death

618
02:06:00,529 --> 02:06:02,292
My client wishes to say something

619
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:08,998
After the verdict has been pronounced,
the accused has no right to speak

620
02:06:23,852 --> 02:06:27,253
what kind of a joke is this?
Raghavan is dead

621
02:06:33,028 --> 02:06:39,263
The accused admits that
he killed Raghavan

622
02:06:39,434 --> 02:06:40,992
what nonsense is this?

623
02:06:49,544 --> 02:06:56,643
This is Justice Raghavan´s court... mine...

624
02:06:57,819 --> 02:06:59,013
my court

625
02:07:01,389 --> 02:07:07,487
Justice Chowdhury, the court has
no option but to pronounce death

626
02:07:09,531 --> 02:07:15,094
Justice Balwant Chowdhury,
son of Yashwant Chowdhury

627
02:07:16,304 --> 02:07:20,502
the court orders you
to be hanged until death

628
02:07:54,609 --> 02:07:58,272
Judge-jury-lawyer-audience-hangman,
I´m all rolled in one

629
02:07:59,881 --> 02:08:03,840
And you... are just a corpse

630
02:09:27,269 --> 02:09:28,497
Careful...

631
02:09:29,337 --> 02:09:30,634
you´ll be all right

632
02:09:44,586 --> 02:09:46,520
Burnt me

633
02:09:54,596 --> 02:09:56,564
Burnt

634
02:10:01,236 --> 02:10:02,726
They came to take briefcase

635
02:10:03,138 --> 02:10:06,369
where´s the briefcase?
Still lying?

636
02:11:24,652 --> 02:11:26,552
Are you mad?

637
02:11:29,657 --> 02:11:31,181
Hey, are you asleep?

638
02:12:29,284 --> 02:12:31,252
No one dies

639
02:12:32,587 --> 02:12:34,521
No one kills

640
02:12:38,693 --> 02:12:40,558
I´m not saying this

641
02:12:42,597 --> 02:12:44,565
It´s in the Gita

642
02:12:54,709 --> 02:12:59,578
I´m merely a tool

643
02:13:17,532 --> 02:13:19,500
In this game of puppetry...

644
02:13:20,869 --> 02:13:22,837
I´m a killer

645
02:13:24,539 --> 02:13:26,507
And you...

646
02:13:31,546 --> 02:13:33,173
are corpses

647
02:13:40,021 --> 02:13:41,511
Not to mind

648
02:14:25,133 --> 02:14:28,500
It was found near
Justice Chowdhury´s corpse too

649
02:14:54,729 --> 02:14:58,563
Manu, where are you?

650
02:15:11,713 --> 02:15:13,613
Is this a surprise?
Or a bribe?

651
02:15:16,484 --> 02:15:18,247
Get dressed

652
02:15:23,524 --> 02:15:25,458
Surprise after surprise?

653
02:15:32,533 --> 02:15:34,501
Just the beginning, my dear

654
02:16:50,478 --> 02:16:53,845
Cool dude

655
02:17:05,927 --> 02:17:07,758
what are you thirsting for?

656
02:17:07,929 --> 02:17:09,487
Cool dude

657
02:17:40,762 --> 02:17:43,890
Dude´s cool

658
02:17:48,836 --> 02:17:52,499
He´s a clever, greedy bee

659
02:17:52,774 --> 02:17:56,437
´That Janus face,
is double-edged sword

660
02:17:56,744 --> 02:17:58,575
Cool dude

661
02:18:12,493 --> 02:18:15,291
He wants the nectar
from every flower

662
02:18:16,197 --> 02:18:17,892
what are you thirsting for?

663
02:18:18,032 --> 02:18:19,761
Cool dude

664
02:18:37,585 --> 02:18:39,212
Am I drunk?

665
02:18:44,926 --> 02:18:46,860
Am I seventeen again?

666
02:18:54,936 --> 02:18:58,565
´What´s good, what´s bad?
It´s all about living life

667
02:18:58,806 --> 02:19:02,674
It´s the magic that intoxicates,
alcohol will wear off´

668
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:04,500
Cool dude

669
02:19:14,689 --> 02:19:17,487
He wants the nectar
from every flower

670
02:19:18,426 --> 02:19:20,291
what are you thirsting for?

671
02:19:20,461 --> 02:19:22,292
Cool dude

672
02:19:58,599 --> 02:20:00,567
was that a dream?
was it true

673
02:20:02,603 --> 02:20:04,901
Just the beginning, Princess Supriya

674
02:20:08,609 --> 02:20:12,375
´What next have you in mind,
my slave?

675
02:20:29,597 --> 02:20:31,565
Now your hair...

676
02:20:34,001 --> 02:20:35,559
your hair

677
02:20:37,004 --> 02:20:38,562
what are you doing?

678
02:21:35,596 --> 02:21:37,223
what are you upto?

679
02:22:10,097 --> 02:22:16,502
The bangles are disturbing me

680
02:22:20,541 --> 02:22:22,509
- Out
- What are you doing?

681
02:22:23,677 --> 02:22:24,644
Out

682
02:22:28,549 --> 02:22:30,176
Manu, what are you doing?

683
02:22:43,931 --> 02:22:45,899
what has come over you?

684
02:22:53,140 --> 02:22:55,108
I´m your wife

685
02:22:57,011 --> 02:23:00,503
Let go,
- Tonight, you´re just a woman

686
02:23:08,589 --> 02:23:10,352
want to get away?

687
02:23:11,058 --> 02:23:11,990
Go

688
02:24:56,597 --> 02:24:58,258
I told you not to touch me

689
02:24:58,799 --> 02:25:00,391
Don´t touch me,
- Listen to me

690
02:25:00,534 --> 02:25:02,502
I want to hear nothing!
Just don´t touch me

691
02:25:02,736 --> 02:25:05,034
Listen to me, I have something
to tell you

692
02:25:11,545 --> 02:25:14,275
Go away from here!
I want to listen to nothing

693
02:25:14,715 --> 02:25:16,239
Stay away from me

694
02:25:29,530 --> 02:25:31,498
I don´t know what´s happening

695
02:25:33,534 --> 02:25:35,502
I know nothing of what´s happening

696
02:25:42,543 --> 02:25:44,511
That which I am...

697
02:25:45,879 --> 02:25:48,279
I am not

698
02:25:48,549 --> 02:25:50,176
I´m not the one

699
02:25:50,918 --> 02:25:57,983
Not I... it´s someone... else,

700
02:26:00,094 --> 02:26:02,028
Someone else is making
me do all this

701
02:26:03,797 --> 02:26:05,890
I don´t know what else
he´s going to make me do

702
02:26:06,367 --> 02:26:08,995
I don´t know what
he has made me do

703
02:26:17,478 --> 02:26:19,446
I know nothing

704
02:27:58,612 --> 02:28:00,307
Happens

705
02:28:01,715 --> 02:28:09,554
Happens... even when one isn´t possessed... 
but your aura tells me...

706
02:28:09,690 --> 02:28:16,687
´there´s someone else within you,
who is misusing your body

707
02:28:20,868 --> 02:28:22,836
Come close to me

708
02:28:58,372 --> 02:29:00,272
No one dies...

709
02:29:01,542 --> 02:29:03,510
no one kills

710
02:29:04,545 --> 02:29:06,513
I´m not saying that

711
02:29:07,614 --> 02:29:09,514
It´s written in your Gita

712
02:29:19,726 --> 02:29:21,887
You want to get rid of me?

713
02:29:24,198 --> 02:29:26,166
You want to see me homeless?

714
02:29:29,803 --> 02:29:36,834
You forget? You are obliged to me,
You forget that you need me?

715
02:29:51,058 --> 02:29:56,963
´You call yourself good? But without me,
you won´t achieve your goal

716
02:30:03,604 --> 02:30:06,095
when it´s a woman who
has to be abducted...

717
02:30:08,275 --> 02:30:11,574
if it´s a woman
you need to dishonour...

718
02:30:14,548 --> 02:30:16,516
you need me

719
02:30:20,587 --> 02:30:22,521
You need me

720
02:30:28,595 --> 02:30:30,563
Murder

721
02:30:30,998 --> 02:30:32,966
Rape

722
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:35,568
Destruction

723
02:30:38,338 --> 02:30:43,298
´Without me, you can do nothing

724
02:30:47,014 --> 02:30:51,917
I´m such an essential part of you,
and I get your hatred?

725
02:30:55,656 --> 02:31:00,525
Hate me as much as you will,
you cannot get rid of me

726
02:31:03,764 --> 02:31:09,964
Because your hatred
is my power

727
02:31:27,588 --> 02:31:29,522
You are so selfish

728
02:31:30,924 --> 02:31:33,859
So soon you forget last night?

729
02:31:35,596 --> 02:31:40,158
Oooh Manu Verma, is this a dream?

730
02:31:40,767 --> 02:31:44,897
Oooh Manu Verma, a I drunk?

731
02:31:45,672 --> 02:31:49,301
Oooh Manu Verma, am I seventeen again?

732
02:31:53,880 --> 02:32:02,720
Come, I´ll give you back your
seventeenth, Tonight, here, now

733
02:32:12,399 --> 02:32:15,835
Let go of my husband!
Get out of our lives!

734
02:32:57,611 --> 02:32:59,579
Supriya, he´s taking revenge on me,

735
02:33:02,015 --> 02:33:03,983
He won´t spare you,
he won´t spare Gita

736
02:33:04,217 --> 02:33:07,311
who...? Who´s taking revenge?
- Raghavan

737
02:33:08,588 --> 02:33:10,522
He´s taking revenge on me

738
02:33:11,591 --> 02:33:17,154
Take Gita and go someplace far away,
- What are you saying?

739
02:33:17,931 --> 02:33:23,665
we aren´t leaving you,
- This is no simple criminal

740
02:33:27,207 --> 02:33:28,834
He possesses me,

741
02:33:30,544 --> 02:33:32,512
He can make me do anything,

742
02:33:33,547 --> 02:33:40,009
For you, I´m danger

743
02:33:41,254 --> 02:33:44,451
Listen to me, go away,
- No, I´m not leaving you

744
02:33:44,591 --> 02:33:46,024
Priest, please tell her

745
02:33:46,593 --> 02:33:48,356
She´s right

746
02:33:50,597 --> 02:33:57,560
You must fight the Satan within,
- How can I fight myself?

747
02:33:58,105 --> 02:34:05,511
why can´t you? How do you give up
bad habits? When you go on a fast...

748
02:34:05,946 --> 02:34:08,107
how do you make do without food?

749
02:34:10,550 --> 02:34:11,517
On mountains... in deserts...

750
02:34:11,685 --> 02:34:18,716
at sea, or underground, how
do people survive adversity?

751
02:34:20,527 --> 02:34:23,087
Is there a God who comes by
to work miracles?

752
02:34:24,998 --> 02:34:29,298
Or does your resolve
your self-confidence...

753
02:34:29,536 --> 02:34:31,504
awaken the power within?

754
02:34:36,343 --> 02:34:39,779
Raghavan isn´t human,
He´s an evil spirit

755
02:34:43,550 --> 02:34:46,110
Not even evil can escape
the laws of nature

756
02:34:48,588 --> 02:34:51,887
Formless they are,
yet they have desires

757
02:34:54,594 --> 02:34:58,155
It´s their willpower
that drives them

758
02:34:59,366 --> 02:35:06,499
But there comes a time when
their will weakens too

759
02:35:07,541 --> 02:35:12,501
That is when evil
can be defeated

760
02:35:14,147 --> 02:35:15,444
when...?

761
02:35:15,715 --> 02:35:18,445
when day isn´t day...

762
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:22,454
when night isn´t night

763
02:35:34,534 --> 02:35:37,503
Fix it, Something must be wrong
with the machine

764
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:44,039
The machine makes no errors,
Error is human

765
02:36:02,329 --> 02:36:04,297
Please let me speak
to the commissioner

766
02:36:04,531 --> 02:36:06,294
This is Arjun Srivastav

767
02:36:11,538 --> 02:36:14,769
The police officer´s job isn´t over
until the criminal is stamped out

768
02:36:30,991 --> 02:36:32,925
The machine...

769
02:36:40,333 --> 02:36:42,301
can make errors

770
02:36:49,542 --> 02:36:54,502
Raghavan has lived in me till now,
Today I´m going to his place, Topaz

771
02:36:56,950 --> 02:37:00,852
I might be able to overcome
Raghavan´s dark powers

772
02:37:23,009 --> 02:37:24,840
where´s Manu?
- Why?

773
02:37:25,545 --> 02:37:27,513
we´ve found the criminal

774
02:37:30,884 --> 02:37:32,852
Right place to look
for the wrong guy

775
02:38:53,800 --> 02:38:56,564
One loose end, Manu Verma

776
02:38:58,605 --> 02:39:07,741
You´ve checked out the prime minister´s
security detail entirely... except for...

777
02:39:07,881 --> 02:39:14,753
´the most dangerous place,
and that you forget

778
02:39:16,856 --> 02:39:18,949
which... which place...?

779
02:39:20,794 --> 02:39:26,391
Yourself... the person in-charge of
the prime minister´s security...

780
02:39:26,533 --> 02:39:31,493
is the biggest threat to him,
Any doubts?

781
02:39:33,940 --> 02:39:36,500
Brilliant! Even I could
never imagine this!

782
02:39:41,114 --> 02:39:46,552
Your smile smells of betrayal,

783
02:39:46,686 --> 02:39:50,315
No, I´m human, you´re spirit

784
02:39:53,993 --> 02:39:59,898
How can I betray you? You possess
all I have, even my mind

785
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:09,804
That is true, But one thing
is beyond my control

786
02:40:10,877 --> 02:40:12,071
what...?

787
02:40:40,773 --> 02:40:45,301
´You display a weakness,
to make me tell you my weakness?

788
02:40:47,614 --> 02:40:50,742
That´s why you went to the blind man
asking for eyes?

789
02:40:52,652 --> 02:40:58,056
This war isn´t over,
- This war will never get over

790
02:41:01,995 --> 02:41:04,361
Because we mirror each other

791
02:41:06,599 --> 02:41:09,568
Mirror-images of each other

792
02:41:14,073 --> 02:41:18,908
But the tale ends when
Evil is vanquished

793
02:41:20,213 --> 02:41:25,173
All Evil was vanquished,
You will lose

794
02:41:25,385 --> 02:41:27,853
I can´t lose...

795
02:41:30,590 --> 02:41:34,048
because I can´t die

796
02:41:38,431 --> 02:41:42,026
I am immortal

797
02:41:47,607 --> 02:41:53,170
The demon´s life lies hidden
in some bird,

798
02:41:55,615 --> 02:41:57,583
Heard that story?

799
02:41:59,652 --> 02:42:02,519
The day I get that bird...

800
02:42:05,992 --> 02:42:08,552
I will hold your neck

801
02:42:09,495 --> 02:42:13,556
Not to forget,
your neck is mine

802
02:43:36,149 --> 02:43:37,946
Looking for this?

803
02:43:51,564 --> 02:43:53,429
Hurt your right hand?

804
02:44:21,694 --> 02:44:23,628
Someone is coming

805
02:44:44,951 --> 02:44:49,183
I want a home... for you and me...

806
02:44:49,422 --> 02:44:53,188
someplace far away,
a world for our baby

807
02:44:55,795 --> 02:45:00,129
Let´s leave all this, let´s go
and make a world for our child

808
02:45:13,312 --> 02:45:14,711
we will

809
02:45:15,415 --> 02:45:16,643
Surely

810
02:45:27,160 --> 02:45:28,957
who´s this?

811
02:45:33,466 --> 02:45:36,299
This is Nita

812
02:45:37,804 --> 02:45:39,704
Raghu, who is this?

813
02:45:47,079 --> 02:45:52,574
Supriya, Mrs Manu Verma

814
02:45:53,686 --> 02:45:56,177
Manu, what´s going on?
- Not Manu

815
02:45:58,458 --> 02:45:59,516
Raghu

816
02:45:59,759 --> 02:46:02,990
He is Manu,
- Only the face is Manu Verma´s

817
02:46:05,164 --> 02:46:09,191
But in every pore of his body,
he is my Raghu

818
02:46:09,368 --> 02:46:11,529
Manu... why don´t you say...?

819
02:46:15,408 --> 02:46:17,376
I´m not what you think I am

820
02:46:21,914 --> 02:46:26,374
You´ve been sleeping with someone
else´s man, But not any more

821
02:46:28,654 --> 02:46:34,183
Raghu and I are going away
to have our baby

822
02:46:34,393 --> 02:46:36,554
You aren´t taking
my husband anywhere

823
02:46:38,297 --> 02:46:43,030
He isn´t your husband,
He´s my assassin

824
02:46:44,604 --> 02:46:48,563
My last wish,
Shall we leave?

825
02:46:50,209 --> 02:46:50,972
He isn´t going anywhere

826
02:46:53,412 --> 02:46:57,280
Manu Verma... surrender... I´m arresting you...

827
02:46:57,416 --> 02:47:02,319
´for the murders of Narang,
Justice Chowdhury and three others

828
02:47:18,404 --> 02:47:20,372
I wanted to kill you too

829
02:47:27,079 --> 02:47:28,774
But you escaped

830
02:48:21,801 --> 02:48:23,029
No...

831
02:48:26,405 --> 02:48:28,373
You can´t be Manu

832
02:48:32,678 --> 02:48:36,774
Raghu... my Raghu

833
02:48:42,755 --> 02:48:44,723
My baby

834
02:49:28,401 --> 02:49:30,369
No one dies...

835
02:49:32,738 --> 02:49:34,706
no one kills

836
02:51:31,724 --> 02:51:33,658
No one dies...

837
02:51:35,461 --> 02:51:37,395
no one kills

838
02:51:38,964 --> 02:51:44,129
I´m not saying this,
it´s written in the Gita

839
02:51:47,706 --> 02:51:52,109
I´m merely a tool

840
02:51:55,815 --> 02:51:58,784
In this game of puppetry...

841
02:51:58,984 --> 02:52:00,884
I am a killer

842
02:52:06,458 --> 02:52:08,392
And you...

843
02:52:12,631 --> 02:52:17,295
are merely...

844
02:52:17,469 --> 02:52:19,437
a corpse

845
02:52:22,474 --> 02:52:24,169
what are you doing?

846
02:52:24,476 --> 02:52:26,444
Come to your senses, Manu!

847
02:52:27,913 --> 02:52:29,608
Manu, she´s your daughter!
- No!

848
02:52:35,955 --> 02:52:41,222
Raghavan, let go of my baby,
what has she done to harm you?

849
02:52:41,393 --> 02:52:46,387
My baby in Nita´s womb!
what harm did it do to you?

850
02:52:46,899 --> 02:52:48,958
Brother...

851
02:52:51,570 --> 02:52:52,594
I´m here

852
02:52:56,742 --> 02:52:57,800
Or I shoot

853
02:53:03,282 --> 02:53:05,182
Raghavan cannot die

854
02:53:08,921 --> 02:53:12,550
I cannot die

855
02:53:14,460 --> 02:53:16,325
Because I ..

856
02:53:16,462 --> 02:53:18,396
am immortal

857
02:53:19,865 --> 02:53:24,427
I am immortal

858
02:53:33,312 --> 02:53:37,840
when day isn´t day
when night isn´t night

859
02:53:42,421 --> 02:53:50,760
Look Manu, the day isn´t day, night
isn´t night, Remember the priest?

860
02:53:52,364 --> 02:53:54,389
Look Manu

861
02:53:55,467 --> 02:53:57,230
Remember what the priest said?

862
02:53:58,070 --> 02:54:00,197
when day isn´t day...

863
02:54:00,572 --> 02:54:02,540
when night isn´t night

864
02:54:03,642 --> 02:54:06,372
This is the time Manu,
Finish of Raghavan

865
02:54:07,146 --> 02:54:08,909
Remember your oath

866
02:54:09,815 --> 02:54:13,717
There comes a time...

867
02:54:13,953 --> 02:54:18,720
when their will weakens

868
02:54:26,265 --> 02:54:27,425
Let go of the baby

869
02:54:27,566 --> 02:54:30,160
You can finish off Raghavan!
You can Manu

870
02:54:34,873 --> 02:54:36,238
The time is passing

871
02:54:37,142 --> 02:54:38,769
Purge yourself of Raghavan

872
02:54:42,381 --> 02:54:43,211
Try Manu

873
02:54:45,851 --> 02:54:47,375
You can do it

874
02:54:49,421 --> 02:54:50,945
Manu, do something!

875
02:55:12,411 --> 02:55:14,038
Gita, run!

876
02:55:14,413 --> 02:55:17,541
Run away Gita!
Go to Mummy

877
02:55:22,421 --> 02:55:24,389
Run away!
Take Gita away

878
02:55:27,359 --> 02:55:28,758
End of Raghavan

879
02:55:30,462 --> 02:55:31,759
End of Raghavan

880
02:55:41,840 --> 02:55:43,364
- This is the only way, Supriya
- No, Manu,

881
02:55:43,842 --> 02:55:46,174
The only way

882
02:55:50,416 --> 02:55:52,884
If I don´t put an end
to Raghavan now...

883
02:55:53,018 --> 02:55:54,781
- He´ll never go away
- There must be a way out

884
02:56:02,194 --> 02:56:03,661
Raghavan! Let go of my husband!

885
02:56:03,962 --> 02:56:05,691
Else, I´ll kill your brother!

886
02:56:31,090 --> 02:56:32,887
Let go of my husband!

887
02:57:05,357 --> 02:57:12,525
I won´t need Manu Verma anymore

888
02:57:24,409 --> 02:57:27,867
we face each other again

889
02:57:45,397 --> 02:57:49,356
That was the last time

890
02:58:03,348 --> 02:58:05,816
No one dies

891
02:58:35,414 --> 02:58:37,382
war is not the solution
to the problem

892
02:58:38,850 --> 02:58:40,818
war itself is a problem

893
02:58:41,687 --> 02:58:45,646
And in the end we face
only two challenges

894
02:58:47,392 --> 02:58:50,259
Either put an end
to the arms race...

895
02:58:50,395 --> 02:58:52,090
or ourselves

896
02:59:26,398 --> 02:59:30,266
Come on Manu, hurry,
we´ll miss the train

897
02:59:32,404 --> 02:59:34,372
Do I have a reservation?

898
02:59:46,351 --> 02:59:49,912
I was expecting to learn
so much more from you

899
02:59:51,356 --> 02:59:54,325
The case you are investigating
is still incomplete

900
02:59:54,860 --> 02:59:59,160
Yes sir... but the files on Narang... Justice Chowdhury and three others...

901
02:59:59,298 --> 03:00:01,357
have been closed... case was such...
