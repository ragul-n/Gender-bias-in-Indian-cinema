1
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,304
Ma thinks I'm always lying.
Do you think I'm a liar ?

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,639
Not at all, when ever did you lie ?
- Grandpa, I didn't slap Ramesh

3
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:03,972
Then... why is his mother complaining ?
You must've done something ?

4
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:10,271
I just touched his cheek, so lightly.
- No, not by the look of that cheek...

5
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:12,934
that one was one big ugly welt

6
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:19,571
Keep your hands off Ramesh's cheeks.
And you get home in time

7
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:36,866
loom out

8
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:41,502
Fix the lapel mikes. Cut the noise

9
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,871
I hope you're comfortable, sir.
Technical problems, you see

10
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:54,402
Understandable.
Proceed when you can

11
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:56,567
Right away, sir. Shall we...?

12
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:08,204
So Mr Tiwari, from where did
this chain of events originate ?

13
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,839
The stoy begins in Gorakhpur.
The contention was railroad contracts

14
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,806
Railroad development contracts
worth millions are issued here

15
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,237
Mafia don Tarkeswari Singh
had a major say in these contracts

16
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,438
In the 90s, the gang was challenged
by a new rival, Don Gajraj Singh

17
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,801
Ty to understand, Tarkeswari,

18
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:47,204
he deserves to get the contracts
for the job in his area

19
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,434
Why must you make a grab for these ?

20
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:56,239
Gazipur and Balia are his, So who gets
the railroad repair contracts ? You ?

21
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:02,004
No, now it's time we shared the spoils

22
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,803
Are you crazy ?
- Hear me out, Tarkeswari

23
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:11,938
Now you hear me out. Eveyone knows,
evey railroad contract is mine...

24
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,104
be it in Gorakhpur or Gazipur. And
I fought long and hard for what's mine

25
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:21,436
And it's been a decade and no one
has taken from me what's mine

26
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:25,736
And the ones who tried, have died

27
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:31,437
You tell these upstarts
to mind their limits

28
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:34,335
let's go.
- No please, not in a huff

29
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,971
I am leaving. I came here only
because of you, Mr Dwivedi. Excuse me

30
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,401
Now what ?

31
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:57,037
He'll take some convincing,
yes he's stubborn, but he'll understand

32
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:05,172
Until then ?
- Restraint. Patience does it...

33
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,869
we mustn't let things
get out of hand

34
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:34,369
Ajay... tea.
- Put it down. I'll have it later

35
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,801
And biscuits

36
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:39,433
Ma...

37
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,335
you'll tire yourself slogging all day
like this... sit with me

38
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,237
I'm not yet done with the unpacking.
- It's only a day since we arrived

39
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,667
You want to get over eveything
in a day ?

40
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,136
Twenty years has transformed this city

41
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:06,871
I've come back to a different city...

42
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:14,170
even the language has lost its grace

43
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,601
Nothing's like what it used to be

44
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,203
You get to bear the brunt of
my frequent transfers

45
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,603
Fourteenth posting in eight years,
you're doing fine...

46
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:36,135
got to pay this price
for your integrity...

47
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,738
dereliction of duty
is easiest to get away with

48
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,602
So how do you find lucknow ?
- Fine

49
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:03,671
I've had a long relationship with
this city. Here's where I began

50
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:11,538
In those days,
one hoarding even read...

51
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,534
''Smile, because you're in lucknow''

52
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:17,935
look, you're smiling for real

53
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,533
What's that ?

54
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:27,070
A few paper-cuttings of reports
related to Tarkeswari Singh's murder

55
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,769
If these are a few, what'd be more ?

56
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,037
As usual, you seem to have
researched it in-depth already,

57
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,667
and now, you're looking
for a discussion, are you ?

58
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,535
Secretay to chief minister
on line one

59
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,934
Yes Mr Gupta ?
- Kapoor, the principal secretay...

60
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,101
and I want a discussion
about the big parade

61
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,068
Sure, I'm in a meeting now...
- At ten thirty

62
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:33,937
Three boys. Sixty rounds.
Firing lasted some 30 seconds

63
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,634
They never had a chance

64
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,002
All rimless. Fired from carbines

65
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:54,038
Rivaly over university elections.
- Semi-automatic in university elections

66
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:03,635
''Smile, because now you're in lucknow''

67
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,401
In 1991...

68
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:15,002
just after the assembly elections...

69
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:18,402
lucknow was a hotbed
of political turmoil

70
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:21,535
Out of the power struggle
emerged a new chief minister...

71
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:25,403
and his lieutenants,
who assumed power

72
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,103
A sirocco blew over
the political landscape...

73
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,402
and all was moving well
each at its own pace

74
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:38,903
The World Trade Organisation
I've heard about, but...

75
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,869
about international trade,
I know scant little

76
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,134
Yes Ma...?
- Can you make her out ?

77
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,101
Please, let it be

78
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,401
Come on, ty to, you're a policeman

79
00:09:54,533 --> 00:10:00,005
What Ajay Kumar, this is Anamika,
Major Subodh Kant's daughter

80
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:05,035
Oh, you're all grown up

81
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,404
The major telephoned yesterday, after
reading your interview in the papers,

82
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,772
he's impressed with your replies, and
I asked him, how's your little daughter

83
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,534
That had him in splits

84
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,401
And here's the little one

85
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,836
Keep yourselves company,
I'll rustle up a snack

86
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,870
Kidney beans are still your favourite ?
- Yes, always

87
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:02,036
Meeting up after so long...
almost twenty years ?

88
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,333
Yes

89
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,468
So... you do something ?

90
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:19,334
So what do you do ?

91
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,468
lecturer in economics

92
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,734
In lucknow university

93
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,735
Too economical with words
for a lecturer

94
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:34,335
''She has the airs''

95
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,870
''Now that the one with airs
is here...''

96
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:52,336
''the fragrance of jasmine
will linger all night''

97
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,335
''The lovely bride...''

98
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,870
''The lovely bride...''

99
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:19,270
''is as striking as lightning''

100
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,968
''Her veil...''

101
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:34,770
What need was there to kill Akhilesh ?
We decided ! No fratricide !

102
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:36,967
Don't lose your head

103
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,803
When we decided on that
our priorities were different

104
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:47,035
Then a word of honour is of no value ?

105
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:52,936
None. If anything's worthwhile,
it's only the business

106
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:56,068
For the sake of business,
we can do anything... anything

107
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,001
Anything !
- Suboo...

108
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:07,504
look Gajraj, it's simple,
bloodletting is what nobody wants

109
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,606
Because nobody stands to lose, except we
and we've been in business for so long

110
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,636
Our interests are demarcated,
a system has been put in place

111
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,769
If you look at it that way,
each of us is powerful

112
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,436
Then where is the problem ?
- That's where the problem is...

113
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,634
eveyone is powerful

114
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:35,367
No one can be reined in

115
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,203
This has got to be changed.
A new order will come to be

116
00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:44,434
Only one will reign...

117
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,803
unequalled and omnipotent

118
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,202
His power will be ultimate

119
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:00,535
And you assume that
we'll abdicate in your favour ?

120
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:04,800
No

121
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:11,704
To which end, you must be
denuded of your powers

122
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,567
So what do you expect from me ?

123
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:24,635
This Gajraj can do anything

124
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,570
He speaks strangely,
of power struggle and supremacy

125
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:33,135
He doesn't listen,
he has gone mad

126
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,601
You're new to town

127
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:41,136
So it's our duty to draw your attention
in the right direction...

128
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,135
whether or not you may
care to recognise us

129
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:57,334
Narain Pandey

130
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:03,771
Mafia don, active in the states of
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh

131
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:12,339
Accused of murder, attempt to murder,
abductions, extortion and gun-running

132
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:16,636
l9 criminal cases registered

133
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,068
What was that about recognition ?

134
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,302
That's a twenty year-old file

135
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:33,235
Those allegations are false

136
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:39,604
I'm committed to social causes
and the world knows that

137
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,637
Why are you after me ? I only came
to tell you Gajraj's stoy

138
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:57,468
Gajraj's stoy and yours...
are any different ?

139
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,434
It's the system you have created...

140
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,136
mafia dons like you
and Tarkeswari Singh

141
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,001
Now Gajraj emerges out of it

142
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,004
And the sole contention is...
he wishes to run your system his way

143
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:19,003
Someone's doing to you
what you did to someone else

144
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:26,705
Yesterday's boss was Narain Pandey.
Now, Gajraj Singh ; then, someone else

145
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:36,336
Your stories are all the same.
- You realise the implications ?

146
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,139
Fully well. It's private turf.
The police will do nothing

147
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,001
So Gajraj goes scot free ?

148
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:51,169
No concern for social workers
of your ilk

149
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,935
What are you searching for
inside the dictionay for so long ?

150
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:22,271
There's this word, Ma.
Supremacy

151
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,502
Supremacy, as in struggle
for supremacy

152
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:30,468
The vey words he said.
- Said... who ?

153
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:34,401
Someone who is a social activist

154
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:39,936
What's a social activist got to do with
struggle for supremacy ?

155
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:46,504
This one has a lot to do,
he's a different kind of activist

156
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:53,438
Do you know the meaning of supremacy ?
- Yes, it's in political science books

157
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:01,536
Supremacy as in absolute power...

158
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:08,405
when assumed, is not to shared

159
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:11,534
It can only be seized

160
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:18,304
Absolute power is his,
who can cower anyone into obedience,

161
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,104
and he makes happen,
whatever he wishes...

162
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:26,867
on his terms

163
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,268
Two things in common

164
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,537
Firstly, these murders
are connected to railroad contracts

165
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,501
Secondly, the brutality
in these assassinations

166
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:52,472
Whole magazines were pumped in,
where two bullets could've been enough

167
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:57,870
The message is, opposition kills

168
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:05,467
Gangsters after all,
Iet them get killed

169
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,803
Good souls, for doing what we can't

170
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:14,802
I beg to differ, sir.
Matters aren't as simple as they seem

171
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:19,002
The victims included police informers

172
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,301
Happens all the time

173
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,802
Then it's going wrong, sir

174
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:34,402
And like you always tell me,
what's wrong is always wrong

175
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:42,266
At ease

176
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:46,802
How many men with Gajraj ?
- Three men, four months ago

177
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:50,402
Now he has twenty one.
Some are already in police records

178
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:55,937
Some are outsourced from other gangs,
mostly university students

179
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,101
Same old stoy, university students

180
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,234
I wonder at times...

181
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,905
how these criminals can brainwash
even an educated mind

182
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:21,135
After all this hullabaloo
over education...

183
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,802
this is what has become of you ?

184
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,101
I've tried

185
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,302
But no one ever gave a chance
to do anything

186
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,802
Ever wondered why you weren't given
even a chance ?

187
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,301
Because you are powerless

188
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:46,466
look up

189
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:50,434
Who'll give you a break
if you're powerless ?

190
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,802
There are no chances for the helpless,
their chances are stolen from them

191
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,969
You see this man ?
And the one standing over there ?

192
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:06,770
None of them ever got a chance,
so what's the big deal ?

193
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,735
It's what has been happening all along
and it'll go on happening forever...

194
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:15,201
not a chance is given

195
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,734
But one thing still
sets you apart from them

196
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:29,737
Unlike you, they decided
not to remain helpless,

197
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:39,172
and not to take insults.
If need be, they'll answer taunts...

198
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,134
with bullets

199
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:46,734
But that was their decision

200
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:52,467
Now, question is, what do you wish ?

201
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,702
I told you a month ago, kill him

202
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,202
He's dangerous !
But who cares to listen to me ?

203
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,969
Calm down,
I've spoken to Kanpur

204
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,100
In a day or two
it'll be arranged

205
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,869
If you only gave me one signal,
I would've shot the bastard

206
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,369
In Narain's death, the last pillar
of the old order has crumbled

207
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,368
The new overlords added
an edge to the old order,

208
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:05,171
unleashing a headline-hitting saga
of abductions, ransom, contract murders

209
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:14,140
Terror ran rife in the world of crime,
the game was getting dangerous by far

210
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,302
Infamous railway contractor and
ex-legislator Vijendra Singh...

211
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:21,602
shot to death, in broad daylight,
inside his residence

212
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,870
On record, are comments by Mr Mishra,
ex-minister for law and order

213
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,771
If mere enactment of legislation
could achieve the intent of the law...

214
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:34,301
the county
would not have come to this

215
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:38,002
It takes an understanding of
ground realities and necessities,

216
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:41,235
and the earlier we realise it,
the better

217
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,204
Mr Dwivedi, do arrange
for a meeting with this Gajraj

218
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,202
You don't want
to mess with him, Mr Mishra

219
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:58,939
He's a cynic, never speaks his mind
and ends up doing these bizarre acts

220
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:03,102
Then he is the man of the hour.
- What...?

221
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:10,538
He will prove to be vey effective in
the political fracas that's shaping up

222
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,967
But Mr Mishra...
- Dwivedi...

223
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:17,536
not all battles can be fought within
the confines of the political perimeter

224
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:22,168
Strange solutions are sometimes sought

225
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:32,936
Mr Ajay, here's the volume you wanted.
Contemporay Issues in Organised Crime

226
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:36,035
It was tough finding this one

227
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,200
Hello, how are you ?

228
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:47,268
Hello, and how are you ?
- Fine

229
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:51,234
looking for a book ?
- No...

230
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,837
my students wanted help,
just being of assistance...

231
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:00,966
Coffee...

232
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,001
do you drink coffee ?

233
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,133
Yes

234
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:13,533
So...

235
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,136
can you join me for a coffee...
would you like to ?

236
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:26,467
Yes... but my students

237
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:30,867
One too many

238
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,701
My policemen too

239
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,468
You aren't visiting us...

240
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,967
Ma often speaks of you

241
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,567
Your coffee

242
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,868
''The heart is mute''

243
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,402
''So pour out...''

244
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:22,402
''your feelings''

245
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,802
''Bring it to your lips''

246
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,568
''Sunset...''

247
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,801
_ _
Or SUnriSe,,,

248
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,602
''you are in my heart...''

249
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:36,401
''evey moment...''

250
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,401
''my love''

251
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,635
''Don't shy away''

252
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,002
''Don't sneak away''

253
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:54,402
''The heart is mute''

254
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:58,501
''Pour out your feelings''

255
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,501
''Silence...''

256
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:03,501
_ _ _ _
says...

257
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:05,867
''things are...''

258
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,334
''going too far...''

259
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:10,867
''my love''

260
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,901
''My thoughts...''

261
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:31,467
''you rule''

262
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:35,869
''You invade my dreams''

263
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:40,335
''In my hair, I find you''

264
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:45,336
''In my arms, I find you''

265
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,835
''In nights of loneliness...''

266
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:53,468
''I find you''

267
00:27:56,433 --> 00:28:00,270
''You are the air I breathe''

268
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,636
''My heart beats for you''

269
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:07,734
''The heart is mute''

270
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:13,768
''Pour out your feelings''

271
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,968
''Don't shy away''

272
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,700
''Don't sneak away''

273
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,802
''The heart is mute''

274
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,436
''Pour out your feelings''

275
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:07,737
Fresh development. Case of carjacking
at gunpoint on the expressway...

276
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,804
by Gajraj and his men.
- How many men ?

277
00:29:13,366 --> 00:29:17,770
Five, including Gajraj.
The driver resisted, shot with an AK 4l

278
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,201
Bullet in the leg

279
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,202
Anything serious ?
- No sir, routine

280
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:28,335
Gajraj is in Benares.
That's his address

281
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:32,901
Confirmed news ?
- Pukka information, sir

282
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:36,202
The house belongs to a convicted felon,
he also happens to be Gajraj's uncle

283
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:39,401
And he's a swine.
I wish I'd shoot him

284
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:43,902
They used this house last month
when the ex-legislator was killed

285
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,803
Do we know the topography of this area ?
- Yes sir, some basic information

286
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,601
So what's on your minds ?

287
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:58,470
I'd rather that we stuck to
the proper procedure

288
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,634
What is the procedure ?

289
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,270
We take the local police into confidence
and we plan a joint operation

290
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,804
like the time when we went to town
with our operation. In fact sir,

291
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:17,737
tv crews were at the railroad station
for the lucknow Police. Even gave us...

292
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:22,370
live coverage.
- So we ignore a well-laid out system...

293
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:26,436
in total disregard for right procedure ?
- Don't expect results out of procedure

294
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,534
Solanki... Yadav is right

295
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,668
The local police must be involved.
- But sir...

296
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,435
But we have no such information

297
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,702
We have our sources.
- Wonderful

298
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,202
Your sources
inside my jurisdiction

299
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:52,703
Well you see Mr Ajay, we're in the midst
of a high security deployment in Benares

300
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:58,537
So there's a dearth of police personnel.
But your mission is as important

301
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:02,536
Assistant Superintendent Tripathi
will join you

302
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:05,701
I'm sure you have adequate forces

303
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:11,570
But tell me, is Gajraj Singh
a criminal of such import...

304
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,469
that it warrants the presence of
a Senior Superintendent of Police ?

305
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:17,168
Yes, it warrants. And some habit

306
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:22,404
Then change your habit !
Officers like you give us a hard time

307
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:45,637
Dwivedi was here. You were asleep

308
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:51,170
He wants you in lucknow.
- Why, for what ?

309
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:54,634
Wants to set up a meeting

310
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:57,467
With this one

311
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:03,304
Ramnath Mishra.
- He said it's urgent,

312
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,068
something important

313
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:10,467
Want to meet ?

314
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:18,069
But tell him, the meeting isn't
happening in lucknow. Over here

315
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,267
In Benares

316
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:25,135
You think he'll come here ?

317
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:30,568
If it's necessay for him,
he'll come anywhere

318
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:28,336
The string of failed encounters
continued for weeks

319
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,170
Operations were mounted
in Gonda, Azamgarh and Allahabad

320
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:36,167
There were also
stray incidents of success

321
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,570
But the efforts of the police
had little restraining effect...

322
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,002
on the activities of the mafia
in Eastern Uttar Pradesh

323
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,201
The powers that be
in the government...

324
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:51,103
castigated the spirited efforts
of the lucknow Police

325
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:57,703
Why is the police failing
to match expectations ?

326
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:04,171
Failure or successes of operations
cannot be the basis of analysing...

327
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:07,569
police initiative.
Honestly, we're tying our best

328
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:19,473
Are such initiatives being marred
by the police-politician-mafia nexus ?

329
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:25,601
That was Ajay Kumar,
Special Superintendent of Police...

330
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,067
on the crackdown on criminals

331
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,336
Dateline October 14, 199l

332
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:41,604
Seven unidentified persons
wearing police uniform...

333
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:47,505
forced their way into the residence
of legislator, Mr Jagatwedi...

334
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:53,171
and misbehaved with the legislator
and his family members

335
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:59,337
You are requested to suspend
the responsible personnel...

336
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:05,872
in order to prevent such infractions
against honest politicians

337
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,201
That report says about all there was

338
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:24,435
Only missing information is,
that night...

339
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:27,568
Gajraj Singh happened to be
the legislator's guest

340
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,069
If we could only complete the search,
we would've nabbed him

341
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,534
The Inspector General of Police
intervened

342
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:46,904
Despite all its flaws,
this city is politically vey active

343
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:52,437
Evey aspect of life in this city
is intertwined. Here's a system...

344
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:55,068
which prescribes evey procedure

345
00:35:57,566 --> 00:36:03,104
In my mind, we ought to dwell upon
the outcomes...

346
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,301
whatever the procedure

347
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,137
This special force has
no juridical responsibilities,

348
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,339
no civil duties.
It's an administrative, legal quagmire

349
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,472
Are you aware ?
- Sir, it's a new approach,

350
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,535
it has its advantages

351
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:42,470
If such a force is ratified, what of
jurisdictions of the police precincts ?

352
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:45,201
Are they to cease to function ?

353
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:52,139
Officers who are beyond reproach,
can be committed to the sole agenda...

354
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,739
of wiping out organised crime,
licensed to use preferred means

355
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:06,939
We're bound by legislation.
This force has no space in our system

356
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:11,269
Sir, let this special force
be granted state-wide jurisdiction,

357
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:17,872
to allow freedom of movement within
the state without any need for permits

358
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:27,901
The force will report directly to...

359
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:31,736
the Assistant Director General,
law and Order. That's you

360
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:41,239
Only a few provisos to existing systems
can make way for this force

361
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:42,733
Provisos...?

362
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:46,902
The Assistant Director General says
that our system is incompetent ?

363
00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:55,436
Even the constitution is amended
using provisos

364
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:59,235
That doesn't mean that
the constitution is incompetent ?

365
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:05,069
Sir, if I may so appeal,
for a special purpose...

366
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,668
let us assign
a special team of police officers

367
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,971
Mr Assistant Director General,
to maintain law and order...

368
00:38:16,266 --> 00:38:22,138
you may use such personnel and procedure
as are prescribed in the system

369
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:42,671
The new irrigation minister's
daughter-in-law needs security cover

370
00:38:55,333 --> 00:39:00,604
Will be done, as you say.
But only cash won't make it work

371
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:06,066
What else ?

372
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,105
The tender for the twin-track railroad
between Gorakhpur and Deoria...

373
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:19,036
has a bidder representing me.
He ought to bag the contract

374
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:25,105
What ! How can anyone guarantee the
contract, what's this, child's-play ?

375
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,801
It's never happened before !

376
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,601
If it's never happened before...

377
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:36,837
then it will happen now.
- Just because you want it ?

378
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,767
Mr Mishra, make him see reason !

379
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,836
Do it the way he wants.
- But Mr Mishra...

380
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:55,005
Gajraj, you've got the overview.
You'll get the details tomorrow

381
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:06,603
What is the matter Ramji ?
- A trunk lying outside the store-room

382
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,138
I'll take care of it. Keep it here.
- Vey well

383
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,773
Major Ravi Kumar is accused of deserting
his post instead of confronting the enemy

384
00:40:56,966 --> 00:41:00,536
Bullets were flying all around, Prabha.
Corpses lay strewn eveywhere

385
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:05,570
Black is the colour of dead blood,
I discovered. You understand, Prabha ?

386
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:11,536
But never tell this to Ajay.
You won't, will you ?

387
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:14,600
Ma...

388
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,870
Papa isn't opening his door.
Will you ask Papa to open the door

389
00:42:00,466 --> 00:42:03,635
This tea is so insipid
it belongs to the gutters

390
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:09,170
I think he sold out to Mishra,
he won't let you taste anything sweet

391
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,971
Stop staring and
go and tell the opposition...

392
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:19,938
that in the elections this time,
Mr Thakur will defeat Mishra soundly

393
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:26,034
Which room is Mr Thakur's ?

394
00:42:26,466 --> 00:42:27,633
This one

395
00:42:58,066 --> 00:43:02,904
look what they're writing in the papers
... I'm guilty for Thakur's murder ?

396
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,102
Anarchy is the chief minister's
responsibility

397
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:11,034
Are we framing a reply to this
or aren't we ?

398
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:17,536
This government is reduced to a joke,
have you read what's in that ?

399
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:21,536
Yes sir, but these four papers
are the opposition's mouth-pieces

400
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:25,402
They enjoy no political standing,
right sir ?

401
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,838
Clearly, a parochial interpretation
instead of objective analysis

402
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:35,966
Right sir ?

403
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:39,700
May I speak now ?

404
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,000
Yes sir

405
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:43,968
What's printed isn't
so much the question...

406
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:46,901
as the fact of what happened

407
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,537
Now question is, what are we doing
to stop this unbridled anarchy ?

408
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:56,003
We are doing our best
to apprehend the perpetrators

409
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:59,035
Then, ensure
Mr Principal Secretay...

410
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:04,336
that the efforts are honest

411
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:14,402
I've told you eveything on phone,
what more do you wish to know ?

412
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,736
In the deposition, you have stated
that you walked out...

413
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:21,935
and was surrounded by
four gun-toting men...

414
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:26,870
who bundled you into their car
and moved off. Can you describe...

415
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:30,035
the place where you were held ?
- Some village, most likely...

416
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,871
the rooms were mud-walled.
- Anything else you can recall ?

417
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:40,337
Excuse me, I'm ill.
The doctor advises me to avoid stress

418
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:45,936
How was the ransom paid ?

419
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:53,838
They summoned my accountant
to a parking lot in Delhi

420
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,935
Gajraj was there to receive it
in person

421
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,801
Settled at ?
- What...?

422
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,268
Settled at how much ?

423
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,266
3.l million

424
00:45:03,466 --> 00:45:05,267
_ust 3.l million ?

425
00:45:05,866 --> 00:45:09,402
Sir, 3.l million is a lot of cash

426
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,267
Maybe...

427
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,668
you are right

428
00:45:15,066 --> 00:45:16,801
But the police was ready

429
00:45:17,933 --> 00:45:21,803
Had you co-operated with us, we
might've succeeded in arresting them

430
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,269
For members of my family,
my life being more precious...

431
00:45:28,266 --> 00:45:30,368
they wished to see me alive,

432
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:32,968
not wrapped in a shroud

433
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:43,606
By 11=03=09 am, the police control room
had news of the shootout at the hotel

434
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,272
Gajraj and co needed 5 minutes at least,
to clear of a 190-metre crowded sidewalk

435
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:54,901
Notably...
- Understood

436
00:45:55,366 --> 00:46:00,204
leaving the hotel at 11=03 am,
they reach their car at 11=08

437
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:09,371
At 11=05 am, Gajraj telephoned
the dead man's brother,

438
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:14,203
told him about the murder
and warned him off a railroad contract

439
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:19,502
Interestingly, this call originated
from a cellphone

440
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:27,404
Impossible ! It isn't even ten days
since cellular services began in lucknow

441
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:30,201
How could he have found a phone ?

442
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:34,736
He has one and he's
making good use of it

443
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,835
How are we to track
cellular conversations ?

444
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:49,371
landlines can be brought under
surveillance, but cellphones, how ?

445
00:46:49,966 --> 00:46:53,369
That was a poser for the man in charge
of law and order...

446
00:46:53,966 --> 00:46:57,336
who was aware that
the police were unprepared...

447
00:46:57,633 --> 00:47:01,803
for this new weapon in the hands
of the underworld. Surprisingly...

448
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,670
the until the mid-nineties
the police across the county...

449
00:47:06,133 --> 00:47:10,136
had failed to place cellular phones
under surveillance. In this test...

450
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,670
of grappling with this new technology,
lucknow Police was at a loss

451
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:23,605
Each cell is a magnetic area, which is
defined by transmission towers

452
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,836
Transmission towers in cities
use tri-directional antennae,

453
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:33,705
on highways, it's bi-directional.
The base station is a transmitter

454
00:47:34,733 --> 00:47:39,537
Sizes of magnetic fields depend upon
transmission wattage of base stations

455
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:44,703
Mr Solanki, one poser

456
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,768
I can't comprehend a bit

457
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,472
The GSM cell structure is hexagonal

458
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,801
Discussions after a peaceful tea break

459
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,601
I don't think I have the appetite, sir

460
00:48:12,866 --> 00:48:14,601
Get on with your tea, please

461
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:23,536
Syed, you got something to say ?
- One problem, sir

462
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:26,634
Our requirements are vey specific

463
00:48:27,066 --> 00:48:30,369
These telecom experts
are engrossed with technical details

464
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,469
We don't need any of this.
Actually, we need someone...

465
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,638
who can explain cellular technology
in the parlance we use

466
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:41,334
I can explain, but
if you wish to understand...

467
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:43,667
you must attend the classroom regularly

468
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:47,368
We'll go over it once again

469
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:51,066
look...

470
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:58,338
it's shaped like interconnected
little hexagons in a beehive...

471
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:08,671
just the way GSM communications
networks are designed...

472
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,304
enabling transit across points
using an audio trigger

473
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:27,437
Be back in class tomorrow.
We will discuss Wll

474
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,569
Mr Tiwari...
- I'm late for my next class

475
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,002
Can we discuss this later ?
- Possibly not

476
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,402
The vey next day,
I'm probationed on research,

477
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,702
and given a spacious office
at the police headquarters

478
00:49:58,566 --> 00:50:03,537
One table, one tape recorder,
two telephones, three mobile phones

479
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,569
From the university libray,
I had picked up...

480
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,437
all available books and journals
on cellular technology

481
00:50:13,699 --> 00:50:18,704
Daylong meetings with telecom experts,
and night-times for research

482
00:50:21,033 --> 00:50:24,736
A replicated SIM of the number
we want to tap...

483
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,302
what I mean,
is a matching SIMcard...

484
00:50:28,633 --> 00:50:32,403
is inserted in this cellphone.
We will be able to eavesdrop...

485
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:35,734
without affecting
the subscriber's bill

486
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,668
And so began electronic surveillance

487
00:50:57,366 --> 00:51:01,336
We placed the mobilephones of Gajraj
and his men under surveillance

488
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:09,106
And we began monitoring all numbers
calling to and from these numbers

489
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:13,436
It took us time
and we had our share of mistakes

490
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:18,170
But gradually, the police caught up with
organised crime's new gadget

491
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,536
Four encounters in eighteen days,
what's come over lucknow police ?

492
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:56,104
Not a single outsider knew that he was
coming in, still the police gets to know

493
00:51:56,433 --> 00:52:01,471
Someone must've spotted him,
he was one for flashy outfits

494
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:05,600
No

495
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:12,304
This encounter had to be pre-planned

496
00:52:14,033 --> 00:52:17,536
The police knew when and where

497
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,468
How come they got the information ?

498
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,468
Pay him off, what's there to ask ?

499
00:52:30,466 --> 00:52:32,868
No, I'm with Gajraj now.
We'll take time

500
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:36,235
Get him to call me

501
00:52:38,866 --> 00:52:43,303
I want him at the Bata showroom
in two hours. Alone

502
00:52:46,866 --> 00:52:48,033
What happened...?

503
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,267
let's talk later

504
00:52:55,566 --> 00:52:57,301
Careful what you talk

505
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:00,801
Vey careful

506
00:53:04,533 --> 00:53:07,802
How are you keeping ?
- I'm fine Anamika,

507
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:10,801
no reason for wory

508
00:53:12,033 --> 00:53:14,802
The body reminds one
of the ageing years

509
00:53:17,466 --> 00:53:22,237
One good outcome of this illness
is getting to meet you

510
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:26,803
You had all but forgotten about us.
- I was here the day before

511
00:53:27,366 --> 00:53:28,800
You were asleep

512
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:33,467
Maybe Solanki... give me a break,
will you please...?

513
00:53:38,866 --> 00:53:39,967
Who's speaking ?

514
00:53:41,466 --> 00:53:45,303
I am Anamika.
- We know you, the university teacher

515
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,804
You tell your policeman, we won't spare
that bastard, we'll bump him off...

516
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,803
so while there's time, let him choose
between a transfer or a lucknow-funeral

517
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,235
No one can save him. You understand ?

518
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:03,235
Anamika, what happened ? Whose phone ?

519
00:54:03,733 --> 00:54:06,302
Nothing, just a wrong number

520
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:28,934
These kinds of calls keep coming

521
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:33,435
But they're no-good folks

522
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:42,736
Thus the need for men like us
to fix no-gooders

523
00:54:47,966 --> 00:54:51,336
It's late, I should be leaving

524
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:13,670
Mr Hariprasad Singh is one non-resident
Indian industrialist...

525
00:55:14,066 --> 00:55:18,069
who has carved a niche for himself in
the European and American markets

526
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:23,070
Despite his great success, he has kept
his ties with his motherland intact

527
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,071
The government of Uttar Pradesh is
therefore felicitating him...

528
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:33,069
for his rare contribution

529
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:39,201
Before conferring this honour
on him...

530
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:42,068
I'd like to tell you a stoy

531
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:46,070
There's this hamlet close to lucknow.
Peepiya

532
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:48,667
There lived a poor farmer
in the village

533
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,002
One of his sons was vey good
at his studies...

534
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,937
but he couldn't pursue his studies owing
to the bad financial situation at home

535
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,004
There was also a landlord in the hamlet.
A vey kind soul

536
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:07,938
He came forward to bear the expenses of
the upbringing of the poor farmer's son

537
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:14,003
From school to college, the poor
farmer's son completed his studies...

538
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:20,005
with the landlord's only son.
From childhood to adolescence...

539
00:56:21,233 --> 00:56:28,607
the landlord's son never ever reminded
the farmer's son of his humble bearings

540
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,601
He treated him like a brother

541
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,001
ladies and gentlemen...

542
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:43,605
that poor farmer's son is
today your Chief Minister

543
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:49,002
And today, at this moment...

544
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:55,003
he's about to felicitate
the landlord's son

545
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:23,668
Kapoor, it's a stroke of good-fortune
for this county...

546
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:25,934
that its affairs are not run
by politicians...

547
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:28,668
but by bureaucrats like us

548
00:57:28,933 --> 00:57:28,933
Else, you and I know what would
have happened of the system here

549
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,534
Never mind. I'll make it.
Thank you

550
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:43,539
Despite his goodness, the Chief Minister
is today in a weak position

551
00:57:44,066 --> 00:57:48,937
The ruling party and its alliances
have only 218 members...

552
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:54,938
in a legislative assembly
of 405 members

553
00:57:55,699 --> 00:57:58,102
It's indeed a weak position

554
00:58:00,466 --> 00:58:02,467
Milk?
- Yes

555
00:58:03,466 --> 00:58:07,803
I've received an offer
from Ramnath Mishra

556
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:13,471
He wants to join the ruling alliance
with 29 of his members...

557
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:18,471
and all his criminals in the state.
I don't need to tell you...

558
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:22,870
that an alliance with him is
vey necessay for us

559
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:27,869
However, he has a condition

560
00:58:28,866 --> 00:58:30,867
Tea.
- Thank you

561
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:38,471
Over tea, the chief secretay spoke of
the transfer of SSP Ajay Kumar

562
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:42,868
It was a small price to pay for
forging a new political alliance...

563
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,702
and a necessity, given the scenario
of the emerging political future

564
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:54,473
The ADG of lucknow knew vey well that
these orders could not be turned down

565
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,401
This transfer is crucial
for all of us

566
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,803
It's okay if you have already made up
your mind, sir, but, if we have to...

567
00:59:02,933 --> 00:59:06,403
effect the transfer of an officer
like Ajay Kumar...

568
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:09,402
to garner the support of a politician
like Ramnath Mishra...

569
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,401
I... I just don't understand this, sir

570
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,805
You need to be farsighted to
understand this move. Foresight

571
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,401
Haven't you left, Tiwari-ji?

572
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,402
I've gotten over some habits
in the last one month

573
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,501
Going home is one of them

574
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,801
What are you doing?

575
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,402
I've been studying Gajraj's
phone details

576
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,403
Whenever he makes a call outside
lucknow, he changes the SIM card

577
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,403
ook, the equipment identification
number is the same...

578
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,404
but the IMSI is altered.
- Good enough

579
01:00:01,533 --> 01:00:03,801
He'll at least get to know that
his phone's being tapped

580
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,804
That gun, if you don't mind...
can you put it away?

581
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,801
Any problems?

582
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,802
The sight of such things
gives me a scare

583
01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:28,804
I can't concentrate properly. I've also
requested Solanki and Baidyanath...

584
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:32,569
to keep these weapons out of sight

585
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,402
No problems. So long as
you are comfortable

586
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:43,034
You tea's getting cold

587
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,401
Here are some call-details, sir

588
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,402
Mr Tiwari had asked for surveillance
on four telephone numbers

589
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,802
The third number happens to be a Public
Call booth at Gomti Nagar

590
01:00:56,466 --> 01:01:00,736
Dubey visits the place vey often and
makes all out-station calls from there

591
01:01:03,466 --> 01:01:05,467
He's expected to be there
at eleven again today

592
01:01:15,733 --> 01:01:17,734
The Second World War
had just got over...

593
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:21,335
and the American economy was
limping back to its feet...

594
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:27,737
when a 22-year old Indian found
America to be the ideal place to...

595
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:34,737
Gaju-bhaiwa, Dubey-ji was at the Gomti
Nagar PCO a little while ago

596
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:37,735
The police suddenly arrived there...

597
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:41,335
and without any warning,
they started firing

598
01:01:42,966 --> 01:01:45,735
Dubey-ji's got killed

599
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:52,337
He had decided to achieve
what he wanted to...

600
01:01:52,866 --> 01:01:57,670
and also overcome the hardships
and obstacles he came across

601
01:01:58,266 --> 01:02:03,671
I strongly believe that a man's life
is a never-ending struggle...

602
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:08,669
What are we going to do about tomorrow?
Must we call it off?

603
01:02:09,266 --> 01:02:11,668
It's going to be vey difficult
without Dubey-ji anyway

604
01:02:14,266 --> 01:02:15,266
No

605
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:20,268
If we call it off now, the position
we have made for ourselves...

606
01:02:21,266 --> 01:02:25,269
will all be finished.
In one simple stroke

607
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:31,269
let's go ahead with it.
We'll deal with whatever happens

608
01:02:32,266 --> 01:02:35,268
Do you have a message for
the young generation, sir?

609
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,269
Yes. Hail India

610
01:02:45,266 --> 01:02:50,270
Members of the Gajraj Singh gang
killed industrialist Hariprasad Singh...

611
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:55,671
near the botanical gardens at lucknow,
and abducted his 10-year old grandson

612
01:02:56,266 --> 01:02:59,202
The miscreants, who were driving
a white-coloured Cielo...

613
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,203
surrounded H.P. Singh and his grandson,
when they were out on their morning walk

614
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,603
According to eye-witness accounts, when
H.P. Singh resisted the assailants...

615
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:11,202
Gajraj Singh opened fire on him
with an AK41 assault rifle...

616
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,601
killing him on the spot

617
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:18,604
H.P. Singh was a childhood friend of
the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister

618
01:03:18,733 --> 01:03:23,337
Hariprasad Singh's body has been taken
to his village for the last rites

619
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:42,603
''I'm return to Thee
this black, calm fire...''

620
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:47,604
''I'm also return to Thee
the white ashes...''

621
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:52,604
''the flowing waters, the winds
and the vast open skies...''

622
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:55,201
''which is anyway mute''

623
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:59,536
''I know God, that You knew...''

624
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:06,138
one day, I would return it all to You

625
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:15,536
Hari Prasad loved this poem
right from his childhood

626
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:20,136
He recited the poem to us whenever
he could, and we heard him out too

627
01:04:23,533 --> 01:04:28,537
In fact, it has taken me so many years
to realise its true meaning today

628
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:33,535
You... were you saying something?

629
01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:38,136
I was telling you about the jurisdiction
of the Special Police Force, sir

630
01:04:38,266 --> 01:04:42,136
The Special Force does not have
any regional responsibilities

631
01:04:42,533 --> 01:04:44,534
Isn't that what you said?
- Yes, sir

632
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:48,135
Without restrictions on jurisdictional
movement, it would be easier for us...

633
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,468
to move swiftly in the entire state.
- Excuse me

634
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:55,137
Must not our focus right now be on
rescuing Mr Hari Prasad's grandson?

635
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:57,468
These legalities can be
discussed even later

636
01:04:59,066 --> 01:05:02,068
The focus even now is on saving
Mr Hari Prasad's grandson

637
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:07,069
We're even discussing the legalities so
that we can nab the kidnappers quickly

638
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:11,470
Saving the child and the formation
of a Special Police Force

639
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:14,700
I can't see what the
connection is all about

640
01:05:15,066 --> 01:05:18,736
You need foresight for that, Mr Gupta

641
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,070
If the Special Force wishes to involve
district police for an operation...

642
01:05:27,266 --> 01:05:30,469
they should be given a free hand...
- Some incidents have the power...

643
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:32,468
to change political thinking

644
01:05:33,466 --> 01:05:36,068
Hari Prasad's killing was
one such incident

645
01:05:38,066 --> 01:05:40,067
In the meeting that extended
Iate into the night...

646
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:40,199
all aspects of the Special Force were
discussed in great detail

647
01:05:44,466 --> 01:05:46,467
Honest answers were sought
for burning questions...

648
01:05:47,066 --> 01:05:50,068
and an attempt was made to understand
evey aspect in great depth

649
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,404
The resolve was there and the formation
of the Special Task Force was a reality

650
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,303
So you are joining me in the STF?
- What else, sir?

651
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,002
This is the time to do something.
We're all with you

652
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:07,003
With you. For you. Always.
- That's a slogan of the Delhi police

653
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:10,002
Whatever. It fits
What say, Tiwari-ji?

654
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:16,005
Right. With you. For you.
Always, sir

655
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,403
Well...? Weren't you told
not to make a noise?

656
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,002
Can't you get that into your skull?
- I'm thirsty

657
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,401
I'll wring your neck.
End of your thirst

658
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:42,005
I'm going nuts listening to you ranting
in the last eight days anyway!

659
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:46,402
Gajju-bhaiwa has sent for you.
- Yeah

660
01:06:47,233 --> 01:06:53,005
Make another sound and I'll send
your head to your mother

661
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,400
You get that?

662
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,934
The rat wants water!

663
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:03,935
Give him some water after an hour.
- Sure

664
01:07:09,933 --> 01:07:12,935
Brajesh...
- Coming

665
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:35,937
Was this the only hideout you could
find? Right next to the railway track!

666
01:07:36,933 --> 01:07:38,934
I can't even sleep in peace

667
01:07:41,533 --> 01:07:45,336
The consignment from Nepal has to
be received at lucknow tomorrow

668
01:07:45,933 --> 01:07:50,937
Take the next train. You'll meet
Dwivedi's man with the money there

669
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,935
Make sure you phone me as soon
as you get the delivey

670
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,867
Kasim...

671
01:07:58,099 --> 01:08:00,101
no screwing around this time

672
01:08:08,866 --> 01:08:10,867
What happened?
- The report has arrived, sir

673
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:13,867
You have all the details?
- Oh yes, sir

674
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,870
Our information was wrong, sir.
They didn't go to Kanpur at all

675
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,369
And the man we have arrested
belongs to the Balram Pandey gang

676
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:25,002
He has nothing to do with Gajraj.
- Tiwari-ji...

677
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:27,869
the number four is really a
public call centre

678
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,269
There are local numbers too.
- What's up, Tiwari-ji?

679
01:08:32,866 --> 01:08:37,870
Well, we have confirmation from the
exchange that Kasim is in lucknow

680
01:08:39,266 --> 01:08:43,870
At 10=20, he made a call
to his girlfriend

681
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:50,873
Because there was a disturbance, it
appeared he wanted to kiss her...

682
01:08:52,066 --> 01:08:55,869
and since the voice still wasn't clear,
he called her again after 5 minutes

683
01:08:56,033 --> 01:09:01,204
Both calls were made from the public
phone on platform number one

684
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,202
He's still there

685
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,202
Splash the water on his face.
Go on!

686
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,201
Where's the kid?

687
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,202
Open your eyes!
Use some more water!

688
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,202
That's okay, but did you get anymore
information from Kasim?

689
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:30,803
No, sir. We got whatever information
he had to give

690
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,468
He has nothing more to say

691
01:09:35,066 --> 01:09:38,202
And where is Chhapna?
- On the lucknow-Benaras highway

692
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,801
About 25 kilometers away from _aunpur

693
01:09:41,033 --> 01:09:45,036
It's the region where we caught
Bajrangi about a month ago

694
01:09:46,033 --> 01:09:49,436
Sir, do we have to really
take the kidnappers alive...?

695
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,801
That's the decision you will make

696
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,536
And your decisions will henceforth
be my decisions

697
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:05,203
Munna... Hey Munna...

698
01:10:08,233 --> 01:10:10,201
Where are you?

699
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,202
When are we going to have
a bulb here?

700
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,203
Find him and let me know quick

701
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:36,202
No word from Kasim?
- No

702
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:39,202
We've telephoned evey place.
Nobody has a clue

703
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,203
let's wait for another hour.
If we still don't receive word...

704
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,802
let's take the kid and
head towards Allahabad

705
01:10:48,966 --> 01:10:50,367
Must be the milkman

706
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,735
Why're you here today?
Where's the boy?

707
01:10:57,133 --> 01:10:59,134
Gajju-bhaiwa, Ramlal here

708
01:10:59,233 --> 01:11:02,135
I saw a white Sumo heading towards
Chhapna early this morning

709
01:11:02,233 --> 01:11:05,135
I've been tying to reach you,
but I just couldn't get through

710
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:07,401
I was so worried

711
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:14,201
Hey! Step aside!

712
01:11:51,133 --> 01:11:54,069
Baidyanath, call HQ and tell them
that the kid is safe

713
01:11:54,233 --> 01:11:56,034
To take him away from here.
let's go

714
01:12:10,066 --> 01:12:13,068
Who were they?
- The police team from lucknow...

715
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:16,670
that came to Benaras, on your trail
four months ago

716
01:12:25,066 --> 01:12:28,068
You didn't call to warn us this time.
- When we ourselves didn't know...

717
01:12:28,233 --> 01:12:31,069
how could we tell you, Chaudhay-ji?
Think about it

718
01:12:39,066 --> 01:12:43,069
Gupta-ji, you are the SSP

719
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:50,070
How could there possibly be an
operation in your area...

720
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:56,003
without your knowledge?
- You don't understand, sir

721
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,002
The STF covers the whole of U.P.

722
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,604
And the local police' involvement in
their operations is next to nothing

723
01:13:04,766 --> 01:13:09,604
The other day, in Bareilly,
in broad daylight...

724
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:12,001
they killed Suraj Pal Ojha
in an encounter

725
01:13:12,133 --> 01:13:15,002
The local police got to know
when they were made witnesses...

726
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:19,003
to record the incident. And you tell me
that I didn't call you...?

727
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,604
You know, sir, the STF and the local
police are two separate authorities

728
01:13:25,733 --> 01:13:26,733
Mr SSP...

729
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:31,368
what more do you know
about the STF?

730
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,604
I began my studies in lucknow.
In the la Martinier School

731
01:13:38,133 --> 01:13:42,604
I was only eight when...
my father expired

732
01:13:43,133 --> 01:13:47,003
We moved to Delhi after that and
I completed my education there

733
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,002
Sir, how were you
at your studies?

734
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,538
But I always knew what to study
and what to avoid

735
01:14:02,933 --> 01:14:06,936
I'm told you got vey good marks
in the Civil Services examination

736
01:14:07,066 --> 01:14:09,535
You could even have become an Indian
Administrative Officer

737
01:14:10,866 --> 01:14:14,936
That's true, but I always wanted
to join the police force

738
01:14:18,533 --> 01:14:20,935
How old are you, sir?
- 3 1

739
01:14:24,933 --> 01:14:28,936
It's important to know, ma'am!
- No! And I mean it, okay?

740
01:14:32,066 --> 01:14:34,935
Tell us, sir! Please!

741
01:14:45,699 --> 01:14:47,935
And you're laughing?
- I'm sory

742
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:54,235
Do you really manage to teach them?
- It's vey easy

743
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:59,870
And they really listen to you?
- Yes. There's a way of teaching

744
01:15:01,466 --> 01:15:05,870
Why didn't you answer Anita's question?
- Anita, who?

745
01:15:06,866 --> 01:15:10,469
The one who asked you whether
you've ever fallen in love?

746
01:15:14,866 --> 01:15:17,468
You think I should have answered that?
- Yes

747
01:15:18,133 --> 01:15:20,869
It's necessay to answer
certain questions

748
01:15:42,866 --> 01:15:44,867
How're you doing, Satyapal-ji?

749
01:15:47,466 --> 01:15:49,467
I'm okay.
- And how're you keeping?

750
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,668
Much better

751
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,869
It takes time for things
to return to normal

752
01:15:55,466 --> 01:15:59,803
What brings you here again?
- I had to figure out some things

753
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:03,402
I thought you'd perhaps be able to
explain them in detail here

754
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,401
Follow me

755
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,802
Hari Prasad's grandson was freed
from Gajraj's clutches...

756
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,734
twelve days ago

757
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:16,802
From the same location, we recovered
documents of two plots of land

758
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:21,804
Investigations revealed that the names
and addresses in the documents...

759
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,802
were fictitious. Would you
like to take a look?

760
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:30,402
Both the plots happen to be located
in a posh area of lucknow

761
01:16:30,933 --> 01:16:33,802
Construction activity is also
proceeding on a war-footing

762
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:37,402
The name of the construction company
is Mehra Constructions

763
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,702
We got a tip off nine days ago...

764
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,802
and your phone's been under surveillance
for the last eight days

765
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,801
What do you do for Gajraj?

766
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:56,736
And why do you do it for him?

767
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:04,736
Take your own time.
I'm in no hury

768
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:16,736
The ransom from Satyapal Mehra was to
be made in two installments

769
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,735
The first, a cash payment
of 3.l million

770
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:23,736
The second was the use of the name
of Mehra Constructions...

771
01:17:23,866 --> 01:17:26,335
as a front for Gajraj's land dealings

772
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:33,337
Even lucknow's real estate market,
like the railway contracts...

773
01:17:33,633 --> 01:17:37,336
was now thriving on funds
from the underworld

774
01:18:00,433 --> 01:18:02,434
Taking him to court?
- Yes, sir

775
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,669
The lawyer has asked for documents to
seek his remand. The hearing is at 3

776
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:11,269
What happened of his file, Solanki?
- It has been delivered to the ADG

777
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:13,267
See you this evening

778
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:21,270
Sir, this is Basheeruddin Ahmed. We
arrested him in Azamgarh yesterday

779
01:18:21,466 --> 01:18:25,670
He actually hails from Nepal. He was the
source of the AK41 rifles and pistols...

780
01:18:25,766 --> 01:18:29,269
we recovered from Gajraj's
gangsters recently

781
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:32,268
This is the photograph of
Mirza Aslam Shaikh

782
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:34,435
The frontman for the ISI in Nepal

783
01:18:35,266 --> 01:18:37,267
He's also connected with
the Bombay blasts case

784
01:18:38,266 --> 01:18:42,269
Actually, this is the guy
Basheeruddin works for

785
01:18:44,899 --> 01:18:48,370
But why would Gajraj mess around with
someone like Aslam Shaikh?

786
01:18:48,733 --> 01:18:52,603
It's not about messing around, sir.
It's all about convenience

787
01:18:53,266 --> 01:18:56,202
Gajraj's criminal activities
are fast spreading

788
01:18:56,366 --> 01:18:59,602
For which he needs weapons
of evey kind

789
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:04,837
And there's only one man who can give
him such sophisticated weapons today

790
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,834
Mirza Aslam Shaikh

791
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,202
How long has this been going on?
- 5 months, sir

792
01:19:12,733 --> 01:19:16,603
In fact, Gajraj visited Nepal only
Iast month. To meet Aslam Shaikh

793
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:20,202
We got from Basheeruddin a VHS
of the meeting...

794
01:19:32,433 --> 01:19:34,601
Stop Baidyanath from leaving, sir!
Now!

795
01:20:31,733 --> 01:20:34,602
It must all have happened
vey suddenly

796
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,702
To live...

797
01:20:57,133 --> 01:20:58,534
Well, lord...

798
01:21:00,133 --> 01:21:03,135
This body is but Yours

799
01:21:04,133 --> 01:21:07,135
To Thou, we must surrender it

800
01:21:21,466 --> 01:21:25,536
And thus, Sub Inspector
Baidyanath Mishra had left us

801
01:21:27,533 --> 01:21:31,536
In the coming weeks, the STF prepared
a list of underworld ganglords...

802
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:34,135
and other most wanted criminals

803
01:21:34,433 --> 01:21:39,538
What followed was a spate of arrests,
encounters, raids and killings

804
01:21:41,133 --> 01:21:44,135
For perhaps the first time in the
histoy of Uttar Pradesh's police...

805
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,536
organised crime was being challenged
in an organised manner

806
01:21:50,133 --> 01:21:55,471
The underworld was badly jolted by the
offensives mounted by the STF

807
01:22:09,066 --> 01:22:13,470
The land-deal in the city has been put
on hold. Things are hot at the moment

808
01:22:14,366 --> 01:22:17,068
I've even told the boys that
until things cool down...

809
01:22:19,466 --> 01:22:21,467
Tea for you, Gajju-bhaiwa

810
01:22:23,066 --> 01:22:28,070
Didn't I ask you to take rest?
You're running a fever

811
01:22:29,066 --> 01:22:31,067
Why're you still working
when you're not well?

812
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:35,469
Chaudhay, have you sent for a doctor?
- Yes, I have

813
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,070
He'll be here by this afternoon.
- Well... go to sleep now

814
01:22:40,566 --> 01:22:42,067
Go

815
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:58,002
The STF guys bumped off
lallan Shukla yesterday

816
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,004
They're now after this guy.
Poor lallan didn't know much...

817
01:23:04,133 --> 01:23:08,003
so he couldn't say anything.
But this guy has all the information

818
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:10,701
If he squeals...
- Nothing's going to happen

819
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,001
You wory for no reason, Chaudhay

820
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:20,402
The moment his health improves,
arrange for him to leave lucknow

821
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,001
I'll find a way out

822
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,403
Ajay, I must leave now.
- I'm going with you

823
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:41,004
No. You've got to become a big man
and look after your mother

824
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:46,404
You must study hard and
never be afraid of anyone

825
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,404
It's not good to be scared.
Do you understand, my son?

826
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:54,001
Go on now

827
01:23:57,933 --> 01:24:01,336
Ma... Papa's not opening the door

828
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:05,335
Ask him to open the door

829
01:24:32,933 --> 01:24:35,935
Don't you guys want to go?
The train has arrived. C'mon

830
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:39,935
The train has arrived on time.
How about the food?

831
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:42,935
Who the hell knows?
let's go

832
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:04,269
His name is Shridhar Pandit.
A graduate from the University

833
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:06,867
His father's a teacher
in a primay school

834
01:25:09,866 --> 01:25:12,868
He was working with Gajraj
for the last ten months

835
01:25:13,866 --> 01:25:16,868
It's said that it was him,
and not Gajraj...

836
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,868
who shot Narain at
the railway crossing

837
01:25:31,133 --> 01:25:33,869
How are you, Ajay?
And where are you?

838
01:25:34,366 --> 01:25:36,267
I'm in the office, Ma.
What's wrong?

839
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:39,267
I got a terribly threatening call

840
01:25:40,166 --> 01:25:46,038
They said that they would,
crush you like a bedbug...

841
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:49,501
come home right now.
I want to see you

842
01:25:49,866 --> 01:25:51,367
I'm feeling vey restless

843
01:25:51,866 --> 01:25:53,867
I'll come home as soon as
my work is over, Ma

844
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,805
I told you to come home right now.
I don't want any arguments

845
01:26:00,199 --> 01:26:04,203
And don't drive all alone.
Make sure there's someone with you

846
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,201
Do you understand?

847
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,801
All right, Ma.
I'm coming over

848
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:15,202
I'll have to leave, Solanki.
There were some threatening calls...

849
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:17,201
and my mother's vey upset

850
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,202
The phone-call really
shook them up, Bhaiwa

851
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,801
Of course, I know that

852
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:38,801
Hey kid, ask for some tea

853
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,802
If he doesn't come around,
won't I have him bumped off?

854
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,201
_ust don't wory, bhaiwa

855
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,801
I could do anything for you

856
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,203
No, it was a lady.
So I was really vey polite

857
01:26:54,433 --> 01:26:56,735
I wasn't offensive over the phone

858
01:26:56,899 --> 01:27:00,737
Unless you get tough with these cops,
they're not going to mend their ways

859
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:04,135
Sure... my respects, bhaiwa

860
01:27:08,733 --> 01:27:11,735
Who the hell are you?
Who sent you here?

861
01:27:11,866 --> 01:27:15,135
Because it was a lady,
you were vey polite

862
01:27:15,733 --> 01:27:20,737
You weren't abusive on the phone, eh?
- You know who I am?

863
01:27:23,733 --> 01:27:26,135
You know what it is to be abusive...?
- You godamn...

864
01:27:41,133 --> 01:27:43,134
What the hell is all this?

865
01:27:49,733 --> 01:27:52,135
looks like you haven't heard
what I said, Solanki

866
01:27:55,066 --> 01:28:01,672
Sir, Kasim told us that this was the guy
who threatened people on Gajraj's behalf

867
01:28:02,066 --> 01:28:04,067
So...
- So what?

868
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:07,668
You will thrash him in public
like an animal?

869
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,069
Because he has made a few calls?

870
01:28:13,866 --> 01:28:18,870
If you are so scared of threats
over the phone, Solanki...

871
01:28:19,066 --> 01:28:21,668
you ought to quit the police force.
Shame on you!

872
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:26,668
For your information, the man
you guys beat up...

873
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,670
happens to be a youth activist of
Ramnath Mishra's political party

874
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:35,670
Ajay, I don't want an explanation
from you for what they did today

875
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:43,204
Ramnath Mishra has given this
entire episode a political angle

876
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:46,068
He claims that because of the STF...

877
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:48,668
UP has now become a police state!

878
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:55,001
Do we have any less problems
to deal with...

879
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,601
that we had to enact
a farce like this?

880
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,001
What's up, Tiwari-ji

881
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,603
From Satyapal Mehra, we had got
information of 5 mobile phones

882
01:29:05,733 --> 01:29:09,002
Four of them belonged to Gajraj,
but one belonged to Chaudhay

883
01:29:09,233 --> 01:29:13,003
A Delhi-based number. The phone has
been activated for over an hour now

884
01:29:13,266 --> 01:29:16,602
Which means Chaudhay's in Delhi.
- That's what we hope

885
01:29:16,733 --> 01:29:20,603
But only an analysis of the call details
will give us a confirmation

886
01:29:21,766 --> 01:29:25,603
While you handle the call details,
I'll go and handle the ADG

887
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:26,700
All right

888
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,002
If there's another mistake,
I will personally ensure...

889
01:29:31,133 --> 01:29:33,134
that the three of you are suspended!

890
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,602
When did you reach Delhi, Chaudhay?
- This morning, Mishra-ji

891
01:29:42,133 --> 01:29:44,134
I had to come to make a collection...

892
01:29:44,266 --> 01:29:46,267
or I'd have left for Nepal
with Gajju-bhaiwa

893
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:51,604
I had warned Gajraj not to take on
the STF in a straight fight

894
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,001
But he just won't listen to anyone

895
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,602
Neither can I help him now
nor can I...

896
01:29:57,866 --> 01:30:02,604
Gajju-bhaiwa wants your help in the
contract for the Delhi metro

897
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,602
All right, have the papers sent.
I'll talk to the people here

898
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:09,002
I'll do that and talk to you
in detail when we meet, Mishra-ji

899
01:30:09,133 --> 01:30:11,001
Good bye.
- Bye

900
01:30:13,233 --> 01:30:18,004
Gajraj has landed us all in trouble.
How long can we tolerate this?

901
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,603
let's tolerate it as long as we can.
We'll find another away after that

902
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:28,603
This nation has no dearth of
people like Gajraj

903
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,002
Yes... please verify the rest
of the addresses too, Tiwari-ji

904
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,601
I'll hold on,
please check the addresses

905
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,002
What are you doing?
- I'm making a guest-list...

906
01:30:45,133 --> 01:30:48,002
of the people we want to invite
at your wedding with Anamika

907
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,234
Tiwari-ji, I'll call you later

908
01:30:57,666 --> 01:31:02,871
Ma, what are you talking about?
- About your marriage

909
01:31:03,033 --> 01:31:05,535
Is that wrong?
- No...

910
01:31:05,766 --> 01:31:10,937
but... I've known Anamika for
barely six or eight months

911
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:14,937
Don't live under any illusions.
The Major called this morning

912
01:31:15,533 --> 01:31:19,937
He said it's exactly 11 months
and 12 days since you met Anamika

913
01:31:22,533 --> 01:31:26,937
How did the Major know all this?
- The bride's father knows eveything

914
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:30,536
And what you know about each other
is good enough for now

915
01:31:30,933 --> 01:31:32,934
The rest you can cary on with
after your wedding

916
01:31:39,066 --> 01:31:42,536
The wedding is taking place.
Do what you want to, after that

917
01:31:44,533 --> 01:31:47,535
If we could ask Anamika
for her opinion...?

918
01:31:49,066 --> 01:31:53,937
I have. She has no problems.
Do you have any?

919
01:31:55,699 --> 01:32:00,471
May I give Ramji a hand now? And I also
have to make that guest list, remember?

920
01:32:05,466 --> 01:32:07,835
So... when did you arrive?

921
01:32:08,866 --> 01:32:14,104
Well, ''The Major called... the bride's
father is supposed to know eveything...

922
01:32:14,766 --> 01:32:16,467
that's when

923
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,903
These two numbers at the top are
at Ramnath Mishra's Delhi residence

924
01:32:38,466 --> 01:32:40,968
One is at a farmhouse in Mehrauli

925
01:32:44,699 --> 01:32:47,469
These are the two numbers
that are important to us

926
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,469
Goldie Car Servicing Centre?
- Right

927
01:32:52,866 --> 01:32:55,401
located in the inner circle
of Connaught Place

928
01:32:55,633 --> 01:32:58,402
I have a feeling we'll surely find
a lead there

929
01:32:58,533 --> 01:33:00,401
Any special reason?
- Yes

930
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,802
Chaudhay has called these two numbers
23 times from various phones...

931
01:33:03,933 --> 01:33:05,801
between yesterday and the day before

932
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:08,401
And no call had a duration
of less than four minutes

933
01:33:08,533 --> 01:33:12,803
Which means there is someone
at the service station...

934
01:33:12,933 --> 01:33:15,802
from whom Chaudhay is tying
to extract some details

935
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:18,969
The question is= When will
Chaudhay actually come here?

936
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:26,803
I'm sick of listening to that song!
Change the bloody tape!

937
01:33:27,033 --> 01:33:29,902
Of course, I will.
What are you flaring up for?

938
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:35,803
Where the hell is Goldie? I had asked
him to come here on time

939
01:33:35,933 --> 01:33:35,933
The bastard. He's never on time

940
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:41,034
Now listen to this song

941
01:33:48,399 --> 01:33:51,402
So you are joining me in the STF?
- What else, sir?

942
01:33:51,533 --> 01:33:55,336
This is the time to do something.
With you. For you. Always

943
01:33:57,733 --> 01:34:01,336
In the retaliatoy fire,
two gangsters died on the spot

944
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:02,333
While Rituraj Chaudhay
was critically injured

945
01:34:06,333 --> 01:34:08,334
On human grounds...

946
01:34:08,466 --> 01:34:13,337
the STF rushed Chaudhay to
the Ram Manohar lohia Hospital

947
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:18,334
And it was there that
he was declared dead

948
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:20,734
Anything else?

949
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:26,736
Whatever our report contained is
already there in the counter affidavit

950
01:34:27,733 --> 01:34:30,735
What do you think, Ajay?
- Yes, sir

951
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:35,336
We didn't expect Chaudhay's brother to
file a writ petition in the Delhi court

952
01:34:35,533 --> 01:34:39,737
He has made several serious allegations.
- Exactly why we've come to you, Mr Suri

953
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:47,337
That's okay, Kapoor. You know how active
the Human Rights Commission is in Delhi

954
01:34:47,566 --> 01:34:49,968
If you had to undertake
this operation...

955
01:34:50,133 --> 01:34:52,969
you should've ideally
arrested these gangsters

956
01:34:53,433 --> 01:34:55,668
Which is perhaps something
you could well have done

957
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,669
Mr Suri, if you want the police to
operate in an ideal manner...

958
01:34:59,266 --> 01:35:01,668
you must also provide them
an ideal environment

959
01:35:03,266 --> 01:35:08,270
With things being the way they are,
to deal with people like Chaudhay...

960
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,669
we will have to adopt
underhand methods

961
01:35:12,266 --> 01:35:15,669
If battles like this are fought within
the framework of phony idealism...

962
01:35:15,899 --> 01:35:17,901
we can vey well forget about winning

963
01:35:20,266 --> 01:35:23,268
The allegations made in the writ
petition could not withstand...

964
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:23,399
Mr Suri's legal genius...

965
01:35:25,366 --> 01:35:29,269
and the honourable High Court of Delhi
dismissed the petition

966
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:33,670
On the other hand, the morale of the
Uttar Pradesh police received a boost...

967
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,801
with the continuing success
of the STF

968
01:35:36,266 --> 01:35:38,668
After ages, even at the
police station levels...

969
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,669
a close watch was kept
on underworld activities

970
01:35:42,266 --> 01:35:45,268
A rare spirit had come to possess
the entire police force

971
01:35:48,899 --> 01:35:53,271
At 5=34= 19 seconds, a call was
made to 9891005280...

972
01:35:54,266 --> 01:35:57,202
the during was 25 seconds.
Right

973
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,602
Tiwari-ji, I'm going home.
I can drop you on my way

974
01:36:09,833 --> 01:36:11,601
There was information being relayed
from Sayed Exchange...

975
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:14,602
Can I help you?
- Thank you

976
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:20,204
As my physics professor said, a man
must always cary his own burden

977
01:36:20,366 --> 01:36:24,203
Your own burden, okay. But you bear
the burden of the whole department

978
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:45,204
Are you still scared of it?
- Well, yes... I mean...

979
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,602
''Strange stoy, this one...''

980
01:36:50,199 --> 01:36:52,201
You don't mind the song, do you?

981
01:36:56,133 --> 01:36:58,535
''what destination is this...?''

982
01:37:00,766 --> 01:37:03,535
''neither does he know,
nor I''

983
01:37:04,533 --> 01:37:08,770
The operations of Uttar Pradesh's STF
have revealed that some gangsters...

984
01:37:09,133 --> 01:37:13,136
of eastern U.P. are now
operating from Nepal

985
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:17,537
Under the protection of Pakistan's ISI,
these gangs are now involved...

986
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:23,538
in smuggling of arms, printing and
circulating counterfeit currency

987
01:37:23,766 --> 01:37:26,135
It's now a question
of internal security...

988
01:37:26,233 --> 01:37:28,535
and it can't be tackled
at the state level

989
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:32,536
We'll need the help of specialised
intelligence like the MW, the IB...

990
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:37,137
and the Interpol. And we are already
in discussions with the Centre

991
01:37:38,733 --> 01:37:41,135
After spreading its tentacles in
the railway-contract racket...

992
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:45,537
the UP mafia is now extending a hand of
friendship to international syndicates

993
01:37:46,133 --> 01:37:48,134
According to latest information...

994
01:37:48,766 --> 01:37:50,767
Whatever you say, Mishra-ji...

995
01:37:51,133 --> 01:37:54,469
Gajraj has really shaken up
Raghuvir's government

996
01:37:57,066 --> 01:38:00,068
Asses! They're out to create
a fearless society

997
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:05,070
The administration and the police...
they're all on tenterhooks!

998
01:38:07,466 --> 01:38:10,468
You were right.
He's really a useful guy

999
01:38:12,066 --> 01:38:12,066
He must only hold his ground

1000
01:38:15,066 --> 01:38:18,068
He won't be able to hold
his ground like this

1001
01:38:18,466 --> 01:38:22,069
We'll have to find a way to
make him stand his ground

1002
01:38:24,066 --> 01:38:28,069
A bye-election has been announced
in the Gorakhpur assembly constituency

1003
01:38:28,699 --> 01:38:33,071
That's an absolutely safe seat. We'll
make Gajraj fight the elections there

1004
01:38:33,466 --> 01:38:36,468
But will he fight it?
- Why not?

1005
01:38:37,066 --> 01:38:41,069
He's being drawn into the system.
He'll happily fight it

1006
01:38:41,466 --> 01:38:44,468
But won't the party's image
take a beating...

1007
01:38:44,699 --> 01:38:47,702
if we publicly associate with him?
- Not at all

1008
01:38:48,066 --> 01:38:53,070
He'll fight as an independent candidate.
We'll only lend him outside support

1009
01:38:54,066 --> 01:38:57,002
But this is where he'll have to come
to fight the elections

1010
01:38:57,133 --> 01:39:00,002
And you know the STF are
baying for his blood

1011
01:39:00,266 --> 01:39:03,002
If they see him somewhere,
they're going to shoot him

1012
01:39:03,399 --> 01:39:07,003
I have a solution to
that problem too

1013
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,001
Mind your luggage

1014
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:12,401
Your stay has been arranged
in Agra

1015
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,003
This constable will keep you company.
Phone me, if there is a problem

1016
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,402
And you needn't wory about Gajraj...

1017
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,402
Kasim... Kasim!

1018
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,402
Have you finished packing?
- Yes

1019
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,403
Ma, I've given all the numbers
of Delhi to Ramji

1020
01:40:41,399 --> 01:40:44,002
Call me whenever you want to

1021
01:41:03,333 --> 01:41:06,936
I must leave, Ma.
look after yourself

1022
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:15,935
It's righteousness that's
always victorious

1023
01:41:17,333 --> 01:41:19,935
That's exactly why I'm
fighting it out, Ma

1024
01:41:58,966 --> 01:42:02,002
According to intelligence reports
Gajraj Singh was in Delhi

1025
01:42:03,166 --> 01:42:05,968
On that nightlong journey,
none of us slept

1026
01:42:06,966 --> 01:42:09,368
Eveyone firmly held on
to their seats

1027
01:42:10,699 --> 01:42:12,701
There was a weird silence
inside the van

1028
01:42:18,433 --> 01:42:21,636
For the next ten days, Delhi
became the STF's operational base

1029
01:42:22,533 --> 01:42:25,102
We got cracking as soon as we
received news from investigators

1030
01:42:25,699 --> 01:42:27,635
We stepped up surveillance

1031
01:42:28,966 --> 01:42:31,635
The aim was clear
and the intention was obvious

1032
01:42:32,199 --> 01:42:34,168
Target, Gajraj Singh

1033
01:42:35,966 --> 01:42:39,102
And probably, this was
the finishing touch to the stoy

1034
01:42:48,633 --> 01:42:50,468
It's clear from his cellphone ID...

1035
01:42:51,033 --> 01:42:55,103
that, he is located somewhere here,
between these two towers

1036
01:42:58,033 --> 01:43:00,034
Then that's where we must focus

1037
01:43:00,899 --> 01:43:01,934
My point

1038
01:43:02,899 --> 01:43:04,901
But Chanakyapuri
is a diplomatic location

1039
01:43:05,466 --> 01:43:07,434
Delhi police might object
to our operations here

1040
01:43:09,899 --> 01:43:12,402
Fine. We'll pick him up...

1041
01:43:12,899 --> 01:43:14,901
and cary out the operations
at Mehrauli

1042
01:43:18,366 --> 01:43:21,402
Why not, after a gallon of tea?

1043
01:44:10,899 --> 01:44:14,136
Know what my Ma says, Tiwari-ji?

1044
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:17,834
When you are spent...

1045
01:44:18,433 --> 01:44:20,401
stand before the rising sun

1046
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:24,234
It invigorates you

1047
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:29,402
Did it invigorate you?

1048
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:33,401
My body, yes

1049
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,235
It's my mind's turn now

1050
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:51,069
You know things are tense now. So why
did you fix this place for the meeting?

1051
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:55,436
Is the power of attorney ready?
- That's why the lawyer is here

1052
01:44:56,433 --> 01:44:59,969
But where are you?
- Nearby. Checking something

1053
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,301
I'm sending Dwivedi to pick you up

1054
01:45:05,766 --> 01:45:07,367
It's confirmed.
The call's been traced

1055
01:45:07,766 --> 01:45:10,768
Gajraj is on a public phone
outside Nizamuddin station

1056
01:45:11,399 --> 01:45:14,102
Mishra.
- Check Mishra's cellphone ID, pronto

1057
01:45:15,033 --> 01:45:18,369
How long will it take to reach?
- At least 15 minutes in normal traffic

1058
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,768
He might get away, sir

1059
01:45:21,466 --> 01:45:22,767
He won't

1060
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:33,169
Tiwari-ji, I think you
should be coming. We may need you

1061
01:45:58,699 --> 01:46:01,903
Ajay sahib, Gajraj has probably
stepped out of the phone booth

1062
01:46:02,699 --> 01:46:04,401
No other way out

1063
01:46:05,399 --> 01:46:07,902
We came up with this idea
after much consideration

1064
01:46:09,133 --> 01:46:13,203
listen Gajraj, you got to
surrender, just once

1065
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:17,069
Besides, these are formalities
that cannot be overlooked

1066
01:46:25,733 --> 01:46:27,701
If you say so, it's fine

1067
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,301
Under whose jurisdiction
will this surrender take place?

1068
01:46:31,699 --> 01:46:35,203
Gorakhpur. It's my territoy

1069
01:46:36,699 --> 01:46:38,701
Eveything will be under my control

1070
01:46:40,699 --> 01:46:42,301
What if I'm remanded
to police custody?

1071
01:46:42,699 --> 01:46:44,735
The police won't even touch you

1072
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:47,234
Why do you wory?

1073
01:46:47,766 --> 01:46:49,434
I've fixed eveything

1074
01:46:50,333 --> 01:46:52,768
You will be remanded to
judicial custody

1075
01:46:58,766 --> 01:47:02,636
And yes, the nomination papers
will also be filed from jail

1076
01:47:06,633 --> 01:47:07,633
Tell me

1077
01:47:09,233 --> 01:47:10,968
I'm in a meeting with Mr Mishra

1078
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:13,634
I'll tell him,
he'll get it done

1079
01:47:23,366 --> 01:47:25,367
We'll send this surrender application
as soon as we reach

1080
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,968
The day after, or the next
will be the date

1081
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:29,968
Then the game's yours

1082
01:47:33,266 --> 01:47:35,034
I need to go to the loo

1083
01:47:41,333 --> 01:47:44,636
Ajay sahib! Gajraj was talking
on his cellphone

1084
01:47:44,933 --> 01:47:46,934
He is with Mishra.
Should be somewhere around here

1085
01:48:12,566 --> 01:48:15,135
looks like the entire STF team
is here

1086
01:48:15,566 --> 01:48:18,702
I suspected Mishra all along.
He must've called them

1087
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,034
Discard the cellphone

1088
01:48:33,566 --> 01:48:34,566
C'mon

1089
01:48:49,566 --> 01:48:50,733
Where's Gajraj?

1090
01:48:52,233 --> 01:48:53,834
Where the hell is Gajraj?

1091
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,068
Must've taken that train

1092
01:48:58,566 --> 01:48:59,667
C'mon, Tiwari-ji

1093
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,835
The train seems empty.
Where's lokpal and the others?

1094
01:49:13,133 --> 01:49:15,535
He just called.
Their compartment is blocked

1095
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,501
Okay, move

1096
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:43,901
Syed...?

1097
01:49:45,633 --> 01:49:46,667
Hold him

1098
01:49:54,266 --> 01:49:55,967
Tiwari-ji, place your hand here

1099
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:07,968
Syed, I'll be back

1100
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:10,501
Tiwari-ji, stay put.
Don't move from here

1101
01:51:04,899 --> 01:51:06,668
Tiwari-ji, what are you doing here?

1102
01:51:07,533 --> 01:51:09,434
You need to be with Syed

1103
01:51:10,733 --> 01:51:11,934
Please go, Tiwari-ji

1104
01:51:54,466 --> 01:51:55,633
He's alive

1105
01:52:09,366 --> 01:52:11,501
I ran a check

1106
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:14,936
Our compartment is blocked.
This is the only way out

1107
01:52:24,933 --> 01:52:26,668
Is it the river?

1108
01:52:27,766 --> 01:52:28,933
Appears so

1109
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:10,500
Move

1110
01:56:05,899 --> 01:56:07,668
Anything else, Mr Tiwari?

1111
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:18,800
Yes...

1112
01:56:21,266 --> 01:56:22,300
that's all

1113
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:32,503
So that was the stoy
of SSP Ajay Kumar?

1114
01:56:36,466 --> 01:56:38,367
Not his stoy alone

1115
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:44,568
It was our stoy

1116
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:48,100
Solanki...

1117
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:53,034
Baidyanath...

1118
01:56:57,033 --> 01:56:58,033
Srihant...

1119
01:56:59,833 --> 01:57:00,833
Yadav...

1120
01:57:03,033 --> 01:57:04,033
lokpal...

1121
01:57:09,033 --> 01:57:11,702
and me

1122
01:57:15,833 --> 01:57:17,534
It was our stoy
