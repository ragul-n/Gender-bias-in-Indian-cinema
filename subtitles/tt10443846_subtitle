1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,640
Did the mouse come?
- No.

2
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,320
Ma'am, bill.
- Thank you.

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,880
Did the mouse come?

4
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
Not yet.

5
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,480
Excuse me.

6
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,840
Did the mouse come?

7
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,600
He will come. He's coming every
day. He will surely come today.

8
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,960
Anwar, kill it when you see it.
Don't miss it.

9
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,760
What do you feel? I will let it go.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,800
If we lose him today then Mr. Chenu
will deduct our salary.

11
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,440
If I find him I'll kill him today.

12
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,680
Uncle.
- Yes. - The mouse.

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,440
I will...

14
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,360
Let me handle it.
- Yes.

15
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
How are you'll?

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,040
Are you hungry?
I got food for you'll.

17
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,480
Look some lentils and rice.

18
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Take it.

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,160
How is it?
- Delicious.

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,440
What happened?
- It's spicy.

21
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,560
I'll get cold drink for you.

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,400
And don't move from here.
Eat your food. I'll be back.

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Do you steal?

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,280
Sahil! Call the police.

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,840
Sir, I'm sorry. I won't do it
again. Please forgive me.

26
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Why did you steal?

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,240
My siblings were hungry.
So I had to steal.

28
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,960
If they were hungry
you could ask food.

29
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,120
What will they learn from you?

30
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
I vow on them. I won't do it again.

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
That's enough. Let him go.

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,080
Go.
- Uncle, wait.

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,440
If we leave them now they may
take a wrong step in life.

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,320
We need to take their
responsibility.

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,600
We? You will go to the college
leaving them to me.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,440
Sir, please keep them here. Please!

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,120
These children need
a mentor like you.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,800
Where will I keep them?
What will they do here?

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,880
We needed an extra helper right?

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,960
Uncle Anwar will teach him the job.

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,880
He won't need to steal then.

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,640
Look... Sir.! - Don't pressurize
me. I refuse to hire him.

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,640
I... Sahil, look. I will...

44
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,640
Sir, please. Last time for my sake.

45
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,160
Anwar.
- Sir. - He won't listen.

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,680
Teach him the job.
Take the boy with you.

47
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
Thank you Mr. Chenu.

48
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,400
Come son. Follow me children.

49
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,560
Thank you brother.

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
What is it now?

51
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,560
Thank you sir.

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,320
Stop thanking me.
It's will be 12 PM.

53
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,400
Tomorrow is the first day
of your final year right?

54
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,560
I will manage things. No worries.

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,480
Listen. This... keep it.

56
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,080
What are you doing? I am an intern.

57
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,800
Keep it. You deserve it.

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,880
Thank you sir. I'm leaving. Bye.

59
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Bye-bye.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,080
Stupid guy.

61
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,320
How are you?
- I'm good. What's up?

62
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,880
Sahil! Sahil, wait.

63
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
Venu!

64
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,880
Where were you?
I thought you didn't come.

65
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,240
I was sleeping in Aman's room.

66
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,800
Dude who comes so early
in the morning?

67
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,280
Why did you wear the muffler?
- I will do it.

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
Just like that. I am feeling cold.
- Look.

69
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Jehan!

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,920
Fool!

71
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,600
He is troubling me since morning.
Idiot. - Let's go.

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Forget it.

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,240
Hey! What happened on your cheeks?

74
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,080
I got a cut while shaving.
Forget it.

75
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,360
Is it a deep wound?

76
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
No.

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,400
It must be Mr. Javed's lecture.
Let's go. - Let's go.

78
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,520
Really? Mr. Javed.

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,680
Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

80
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,920
Settle down.
- Thank you sir. - Thank you sir!

81
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,720
So guys how was your vacation?

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,880
Amazing sir.
- Good. - Great.

83
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,080
This semester we will
be starting...

84
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,120
Yes.

85
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,680
Hello Sir! I am Mittee.

86
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,960
Oh yes.
Mr. Das informed me about you.

87
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,040
You are late.
- Sorry sir!

88
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,160
Come.

89
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,240
So this semester we will start
with a very interesting topic.

90
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,960
If all is done in the process...

91
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,520
Come on, sit there.

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,120
Yes sir.

93
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,160
Hi! Venugopal.

94
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,760
Hi!
- Hi!

95
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,840
Hi!
- Hi!

96
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
And that one.

97
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,000
Look at you it's not even 24
hours that you've seen her.

98
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,480
I found her sweet.

99
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,000
How come she's sweet without
knowing her? Idiot.

100
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,680
Come on.
- What?

101
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,440
She is coming here.
- Let's join them. - Sure.

102
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Where were you before this?
- Delhi.

103
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,880
Oh, I am also from Delhi. Noida.

104
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,640
Which sector?
- 16. - Nice! - Fool!

105
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,040
Hey! - Gyan, that's enough.
- What are you doing?

106
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,800
Look,
the body guard is getting angry.

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,080
Sit down. Forget it. - Sit down.
They keep troubling all the time.

108
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
Forget it. You know how he is.

109
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,240
These two often fight.

110
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,760
Hey! A tattoo?

111
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,600
You said it's a cut. Show it to me.

112
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,320
Anuisvenu?

113
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,360
Anu is Venu.
There's an apostrophe after Anu.

114
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,960
Who is Anu?

115
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,960
She's my wife.

116
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,280
Wife? Did you marry during
the vacation? - Hush!

117
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,960
In my family everyone gets
married at the age of 21.

118
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
They got me married too.

119
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,760
Do you know the meaning of Anus?

120
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
I know it.
The place you leave faeces.

121
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,200
I realised after I made the tattoo
that is looks anus and not Anu.

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,200
What will you do with it? - I will
bandage it. - The whole year?

123
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.
Jehan and Om shouldn't notice it.

124
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,800
Hey! Vow on me.
Don't tell anyone. It's our secret.

125
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,360
Okay Anus.
- Stupid.

126
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,800
Hey!

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,520
What were you watching?
- Nothing.

128
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,520
Desibhai.com.

129
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Anything.

130
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
If you are not watching then show
it to me. Why are you hiding it?

131
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,240
Oh, the Delhi girl.

132
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,200
I will tell Mittee.

133
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,440
Sahil Mehra is feeling something.

134
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,840
She's cute. Your choice is not bad.

135
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,560
What did you do?

136
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,960
If you tell anyone I'll make your
tattoo picture viral. I...

137
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
Delete it.
- Why?

138
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,520
Do you feel I'll tell anyone?

139
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,400
Don't think about it.
- You are serious.

140
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,160
Obviously!

141
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,800
It's her birthday tomorrow. Look.
- Birthday?

142
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,400
7th June. It's written here. Look!

143
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,200
Enjoy your drink.
- Yeah. Thank you.

144
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,960
Here.

145
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,200
It's fine. Mittee didn't invite
us for her birthday. So what?

146
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,200
We are having our party.
Take it. Come on.

147
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,560
Cheers!

148
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,360
Look, the girl with golden hair.
She is staring at me.

149
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,920
Drink it.
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

150
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,520
Venu, you are married.

151
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,560
I am going to dance. Let me dance.

152
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,120
If you do anything else.
I will pull off this bandage.

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
I got it.
- What?

154
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Thank you.

155
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,120
Come along.

156
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,240
Oh my god!

157
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
Mittee, come quickly.

158
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,600
Hey!
- Hi!

159
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,680
Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

160
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,520
Two large avelox on the rocks.

161
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,120
What should I get for you?
Milk or sweet butter milk.

162
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,640
Mittee! Cheers!

163
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,560
Drink it.

164
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,080
Oh, this is my favourite song.
Come let's dance.

165
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Why not? Let's go.

166
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,040
Jehan! I'll join you in some time.

167
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,240
Why later? Come on.
- Please!

168
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,160
Okay. If you don't come for the next
track I'll pull you on the floor.

169
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,360
Now let's work it boys!

170
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,920
Oh no! He is so irritating.

171
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,960
Take this drink. Have it.

172
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,440
Actually I don't smoke or drink.

173
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,520
Really?
- Yes.

174
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Same here.

175
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,760
I don't understand why you need
alcohol for enjoyment.

176
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,400
I agree.
- Whoa!

177
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,440
Sorry! I didn't invite
you for my birthday.

178
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,920
It's okay.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm new here. So I called the people
Kavita suggested. Really sorry.

180
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,080
It's not a problem.

181
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,440
Anyway we are celebrating.

182
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,320
The track has changed.
Jehan will come. I'll step out.

183
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,840
Mittee! I'll come with you.

184
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,080
You sure?
- Sure. Come.

185
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,160
What are you thinking so seriously?

186
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,880
Actually I am thinking which
topic should we talk on.

187
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,200
Your favourite film.
- What?

188
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Quickly. It's rapid fire question.

189
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,520
Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho'.

190
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,720
Hey, give a Bollywood name.

191
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,160
'Dil Chahta Hai'. And you?

192
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,800
'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.'
Ranbir's fan for life.

193
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,680
Good choice.

194
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,520
Favourite City?

195
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Amritsar.

196
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,400
The Golden Temple and the World's
best 'Chole Kulcha'.

197
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Nice choice.
- Yours?

198
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,160
London.
My dream is settle down there.

199
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,560
Ask me something.

200
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,760
Okay.

201
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,960
Come on Sahil. Ask something funny.

202
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,920
Sorry!

203
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,400
Love marriage or arranged marriage?
- Arrange. Obviously.

204
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,520
I'm okay with my parents’ choice.

205
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
You?

206
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Love marriage.

207
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,160
Okay. This will be fun.

208
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
First kiss.

209
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
It's pending.

210
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,280
What? You never kissed?

211
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,440
You don't have a girl-friend?
- No.

212
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,400
Are you serious?

213
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,720
I thought I'm the only one who
hasn't kissed until now.

214
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,400
You know all my friends
make so much fun of me.

215
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,880
Just a second.

216
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,040
It means you haven't kissed yet?

217
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,840
No.
- Superb. It's coincidence.

218
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
What makes you happy?

219
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,400
No. I am not happy.

220
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,000
I was... just like that.

221
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,000
Why just like that?

222
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Nothing.

223
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
God!

224
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,560
This is the oldest
Church of Shimla.

225
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,400
Venu and I often come here.

226
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
How sweet!

227
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,480
Do you have any best friend?

228
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,880
Dad! He's my best friend.

229
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,520
He's my strength and weakness too.

230
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
You?

231
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,480
Venu is my best friend.

232
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,920
Okay. Mom or dad?

233
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,400
Can't choose.
I was close to them equally.

234
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,240
What do you mean by I was?

235
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,800
They are no more.
- Oh! I'm so sorry.

236
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,240
Actually...
- It's okay.

237
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,400
It's 10 years now. It's fine.

238
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,880
When starting a new restaurant.

239
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,160
Making a menu is a main duty
that you will undertake...

240
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,480
as a restaurant owner.
- We all were at the club.

241
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,520
But you enjoyed the real party.

242
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,160
Which party?

243
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,880
Mittee Deora's party.
Did you do anything or not?

244
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,400
Come on, tell me.

245
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,840
I told you.

246
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,920
Why are you hiding from me?
It's okay if you did it.

247
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,960
Kavita, Sahil and I didn't kiss.

248
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,200
Hello!
- What are you doing?

249
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
Don't say you didn't
even hold her hand.

250
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
I didn't.

251
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,080
Why not? Everything holds hand.

252
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Bloody useless! - What did
you both do for one hour?

253
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,640
Are you thinking of this
since morning? - Yes.

254
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
We chilled.
Spoke to each other. Played games.

255
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,320
Did you go to Karan Johar's show?
Rapid fire?

256
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,880
The idea was hers.

257
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,280
When a girl calls you for a walk
it means something else.

258
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,680
She won't give you a second chance.
Your game is over, bro.

259
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,960
Alright. My game is over.

260
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,120
Are you happy? Now go to sleep.

261
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,960
Good night.

262
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Hey!

263
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:39,920
"You came like a breath
of fresh air!"

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:51,200
"You can be any language I'll
blend you in my own!"

265
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,640
"Your smile is the remedy
for my sorrow!"

266
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
"When I hear your footsteps I feel
a thousand lights are lit up!"

267
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,680
"When I meet you the surrounding
gets excited!"

268
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,680
"My eyes spark when I meet you!"

269
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:23,880
"You came like a breath
of fresh air!"

270
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:34,400
"You can be any language I'll
blend you in my own!"

271
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,200
"I feel relaxed when I
see your frizzy hair!"

272
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,920
"If you notice me I
don't feel lonely!"

273
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:20,840
"I live for you. My heart stops
beating when you touch me!"

274
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,840
"You are the word that
my heart has!"

275
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:33,920
"I am possessive about you!"

276
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:44,080
"You came like a breath
of fresh air!"

277
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:55,480
"You can be any language I'll
blend you in my own!"

278
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,800
I really like you a lot.

279
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,280
I love you Mittee!

280
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,360
I love you!

281
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,720
I love you too.

282
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,320
Sahil!

283
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
But... I am not ready for this.

285
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,800
I know I am behaving stupid
and old fashion. But...

286
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,080
I'm sorry Sahil.

287
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,400
Actually I'm sorry.

288
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,640
Maybe I was too... I mean.

289
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Wow! Perfect.

291
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,480
I don't have a shirt in red.

292
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,600
Red is my favourite colour
so I thought...

293
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I noticed it.

294
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,320
You mostly wear red clothes. Right?

295
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,920
Shall we go to Sky Land for dinner?

296
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,840
Yes. We can go.

297
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,640
It's our first dinner date.

298
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,960
But why a five star hotel?

299
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,920
We will go to Momo's.

300
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,680
No. Let's do something grand.

301
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,240
There are so many under privilege
people who don't get a meal.

302
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,800
We'll spend so much
money for one date.

303
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,080
I agree but...

304
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,520
I wanted to do something special
for us. That's it.

305
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,080
If you want to do anything special.

306
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,680
Then there are other
means to do it.

307
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,320
Any example?
- For example...

308
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,080
My parents celebrate my birthday
in an orphanage at Nodia.

309
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,520
That is so sweet Mittee.

310
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
If you want then...

311
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,280
We can donate a small amount
at that same orphanage.

312
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,440
Instead of this dinner.
- Superb idea!

313
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,280
Muskan foundation. Rs.10,000 only.

314
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,800
10,000?
- Yes.

315
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,840
Don't be stupid.
5,000 is sufficient.

316
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,480
Dad has left so much for me.

317
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,440
Anyway I don't have much expenses.
- Still Sahil.

318
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,440
Instead of lying in the bank it's
better it helps the orphans.

319
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,200
It's really okay.

320
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,320
And transfer.
- You are very stubborn.

321
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,360
True.
- Guys! - Hi!

322
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,480
Guest lecture at 6 PM.
You both have to be there.

323
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,080
Okay. See you.
- Thank you!

324
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,400
Mr. Kaif of Lion's group
is visiting us.

325
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,560
But we had a date today?
- Yes.

326
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
What to do?

327
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,640
Hospitality exist...

328
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,680
when we believe that the other
person is on our side.

329
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,680
My dear friends I want all
of you to believe...

330
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,760
that you are not merely management

331
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
students but you are in fact...

332
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Where are you?

333
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,360
I am having severe headache.
I am sleeping.

334
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,480
Headache? I'm coming over.

335
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,200
No Sahil! Attend the lecture.

336
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,600
Please! It's important.

337
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,360
Alright. Take medicine and go to
sleep. You will feel better.

338
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Good night.

339
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,760
You forced me to come here
though I had diarrhoea.

340
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,800
You got worried as Mittee
has a mere headache.

341
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,760
If she didn't have any headache she
would obviously attend the lecture.

342
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,360
Idiot!
Is headache bad or diarrhoea?

343
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,880
Any problems?
- What is wrong with you? - Venu.

344
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Sorry sir!

345
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
What are you doing?
- I'm having diarrhoea.

346
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,120
People bunk lectures
to go on a date.

347
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,680
You bunked date and attended
the lecture.

348
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,240
You are stupid.
- Brother!

349
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,160
Yes. - The guy from 210 took pizza.
But he's not paying. Help me.

350
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,640
Who's order is it?
- Jehan.

351
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Jehan!

352
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,240
He won't change. Let's go.

353
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,360
You take care of Jehan's bill.
I'll take care of my problem.

354
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,120
Let's go.

355
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,080
Go in.
- The door is open.

356
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,280
I'm knocking since some time. He's
not opening the door. Please check.

357
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Jehan!

358
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Jehan!

359
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
Jehan!

360
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,480
Jehan,
the pizza guy is waiting outside.

361
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Jehan!

362
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Sahil!

363
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,080
Love birds!

364
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
Sahil! Sahil, listen to me. Please!

365
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,080
Sahil!

366
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,440
You shouldn't have lied, Mittee.
You shouldn't have.

367
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,760
It's not about smoking or drinking.

368
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,160
You said you have headache
and were going to sleep.

369
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Whereas you were chilling
in Jehan's room.

370
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,120
The same Jehan who you feel is
cheap and irritating. Really?

371
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,520
Sahil! You didn't try to find out
why I didn't attend the lecture.

372
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,880
Why I had a headache?

373
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,040
Why?

374
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,480
My grandmother had an
attack last evening.

375
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,320
She is hospitalized.

376
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,160
Why didn't you tell me?

377
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,120
I was disturbed since yesterday. I
didn't share anything with anyone.

378
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,880
I wanted to tell you.

379
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,560
How is your grandmother now?

380
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,800
She is fine now.

381
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,720
She will get a discharge tomorrow.

382
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,840
Seeing you having drugs
yesterday...

383
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,480
I don't take drugs.

384
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,920
I was feeling so low.
I don't know why I took the drag.

385
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,840
Now I feel so stupid about it.

386
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,920
I swear on my grandmother, Sahil.

387
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Anyway.

388
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,200
Forget what happened. I mean...

389
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,320
It's useless to think about this.

390
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,160
Sorry! Sorry! Just a second.

391
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,680
Good morning baby!

392
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,760
Good morning!
What message have you sent?

393
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,320
Last night Mr. Chenu
called at 1 AM.

394
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,920
I am going to Manali as the CA
has problem with accounts.

395
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,800
Oh! But we had a date today.

396
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,040
I know. I'm sorry. I couldn't
refuse Mr. Chenu.

397
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,680
We will go tomorrow after I return.

398
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Alright. As you say.

399
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,280
Baby, it's 8.45 AM. Don't you
want to dress up. Wake up.

400
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,080
Yes. Love you. Bye!

401
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,920
Bye! Love you.

402
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,200
You know there is little...

403
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,040
Yes Venu. I've returned. The CA's
account problem got solved.

404
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,760
Listen. I'm very hungry.
I'll eat something.

405
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,160
Yes.
Alright. I'll get for you too. Bye.

406
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,840
Give me my phone.
Mittee, what are you doing?

407
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,240
Wait. I'll show you. Ah!

408
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,960
Jehan! Jehan!
- Oh!

409
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
What?

410
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
Hi Sahil!

411
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,800
You returned today itself?

412
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,520
What is happening here?

413
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,760
Wh... What?

414
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,960
We were just...

415
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Just like that? - Dude! Chill out.
Why are you scaring the girl?

416
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,120
Don't interfere.

417
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,360
Mittee, go away from here.

418
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,480
I am talking to her.

419
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,080
I am talking to you, loser.

420
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,640
Sahil!

421
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,520
"Love is foolishness.
Loving is foolishness!"

422
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,800
"It's a sweet way of cheating.
Believing is foolishness!"

423
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:28,600
"The heart is like a piece of paper.
You will repent if you light it!"

424
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:37,800
"All your desires are
shed in tears!"

425
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:44,640
"Love is foolishness.
Loving is foolishness!"

426
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:53,240
"It's a sweet way of cheating.
Believing is foolishness!"

427
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:18,960
"Why are the promises false?
Why are nights painful?"

428
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:26,880
"Why are you crying?
Why this sleepless night?"

429
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,960
"Why did my heart break?
Why are morning's dark?"

430
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:43,240
"Why does my soul feel unwanted?"

431
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,200
"Love is foolishness.
Loving is foolishness!"

432
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:01,800
"It's a sweet way of cheating.
Believing is foolishness!"

433
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,200
Last 30 minutes to go!

434
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,400
Ma'am, supplement.

435
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Ma'am!

436
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,800
Come with me.

437
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,480
The answers are on her thighs.

438
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,680
I was gesturing to you to
show what she is doing.

439
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,120
But you complained about her.

440
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,800
So? We are working hard and
she'll copy to pass.

441
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,880
Don't you think she deserved it?

442
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,560
She deserved it. But I don't know.

443
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,080
Mittee has to repeat this year.
That's final.

444
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,200
Sir, we broke our F.D's to
get Mittee this admission.

445
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,800
How will I get more money?

446
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,760
Mittee should have thought about it
before she copied her answers.

447
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,760
Sir! Sir! Sir, please!

448
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,880
Sir, I beg of you.

449
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,920
Sir! Don't do this.

450
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,240
Mr. Deora, what are you doing?
Get up. - Please!

451
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,240
Give one chance to my daughter.

452
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,840
Dad, what are you doing?

453
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,560
Please! Sit down. Come.

454
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,960
Dad is a heart patient.
He may get an attack.

455
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,800
Sir, please. Give me one chance.

456
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,240
Please!

457
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,040
I am giving you one last chance.

458
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,760
Yes.

459
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,400
But there is a condition.

460
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,240
Mittee can score any percentage
in her exam.

461
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,280
But in the final mark sheet the
college will give her only 35%.

462
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,560
I can't do anything more than this.

463
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,760
35%?

464
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,600
Listen guys. I am worried. One
of you must come with me.

465
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,960
I think we have to break
Mittee's door.

466
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,360
What happened?
- I don't know.

467
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,760
Kavita is knocking the door.
She's not opening it.

468
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,280
Sara! Sara! Relax!
- I hope she hasn't harmed herself.

469
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,080
Let's go and see what happened.
- Come on.

470
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,560
What happened?
- Open the door.

471
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,520
Open the door.
- Someone break the door.

472
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,480
Quick. Mittee.
- Sara, just relax!

473
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,600
Mittee, please wake up.
Mittee! Mittee!

474
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,480
Kavita, don't panic.
- Take care.

475
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,200
Mittee, please. - She will be
fine. - Mitte, speak to me.

476
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,440
Mittee! Mittee!
- Don't worry.

477
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,200
I don't know what happened to her.
Come along.

478
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,240
How is she now?

479
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,240
'Reports are normal.
But there's a bad news.'

480
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,760
What?

481
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,400
'Her grandmother died
this afternoon.'

482
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,760
What are you saying?

483
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,800
'Listen, the doctor is here.
I'll call you later.'

484
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,320
I was close to grandmother
after dad.

485
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,600
The worst part is I couldn't go
to Delhi because of my health.

486
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,160
I'm really sorry Mittee.

487
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,320
I heard about your 35% marks.

488
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,840
I didn't expect that...

489
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,480
the authorities will take
such strict action.

490
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,080
Why are you saying sorry?

491
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,760
I deserve it.

492
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm sorry for everything.

493
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,440
I won't force you.

494
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,080
But if possible please
give me a chance.

495
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,320
Please!

496
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,960
Sahil! Sahil! Are you alright?

497
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,440
What happened?

498
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,640
It's done.
- Where?

499
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,640
Really? Let's ask Sahil.

500
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
Tell me who it belongs to.

501
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,600
I think it belongs to Ria ma'am.

502
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,040
It must be of Mr. Das.
It matches his shirt.

503
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,480
Right. My God!

504
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,200
She is so small.
It can't belong to Kavita at all.

505
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,800
Kavita!
- Just shut up.

506
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Sahil! It's mine. Please stop him.

507
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,240
Hey! This belongs to Mittee.

508
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,600
Venu! Don't create a scene.
Give it here.

509
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,520
Here.

510
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,800
Sahil!
- Sahil! - Sahil, no.

511
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Sahil! What are you doing?
- Sahil, leave him.

512
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,160
Sahil, let him go.

513
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,480
Are you fine?
- Are you mad? Why did you hit me?

514
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,920
Mittee, let's go.
- Venu. - He broke my hand.

515
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
Come.
- He is mad.

516
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,440
I shouldn't have told you.

517
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,720
The matter has escalated that
even Mr. Javed has found out.

518
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,920
Hey! Slowly.

519
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,560
Sorry Venu. It's my mistake.

520
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,440
It's the mistake of
his overreaction.

521
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,600
Did I find it?
How will I know who's it is?

522
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,160
Why didn't you stop
when you found out?

523
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,120
I was having fun. It's just her
undergarment. Why get angry?

524
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,320
If someone makes fun of your mom's
undergarment won't you get angry.

525
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,080
Why are you talking about my mom?
Why?

526
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,440
Such examples are given
to fools like you.

527
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Your mom is no more. So you won't
understand the emotion.

528
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,320
Stop it guys. Stop it!

529
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,120
It shows that it was at
100% boiling fall.

530
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,960
Which is ideal for the
service industry.

531
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,840
The first part of the distillate
is the head. Followed by the...

532
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,960
Look here?

533
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,280
What is going on class?

534
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,200
What is this?
- What is happening?

535
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,440
Did you read it?
- What is happening here?

536
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,080
Anus!
- Anus!

537
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,560
What's wrong with all of you?

538
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,240
Anus Venu. - What?
- Jehan, what are you doing?

539
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,720
Sorry sir. Sorry.
- Venu?

540
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,200
Everyone has seen it.

541
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,800
What is Anus Venu?

542
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,080
Venu? Go back to your seat.

543
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,360
Oh no!

544
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,600
Where did you get the picture from?

545
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,080
Sources, bro.

546
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,880
Tell me clearly where
did you get it from?

547
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,600
I won't tell you. What will you do?
Hit me? Then hit me.

548
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,080
Hit me. Get that anger out.

549
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,240
Fool.

550
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,640
Let's go.

551
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,520
(Other language)

552
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,960
Sahil, what are you doing?
- Boys, hold him.

553
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,880
Sahil! Sahil!

554
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,120
Sahil!
- Mittee, are you okay?

555
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,520
Guys, stop it.
- Why are you hitting him?

556
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,600
Sahil has gone mad. - Guys!
Guys! - Ask him what he has done.

557
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,120
He was destroying everything
in my room.

558
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,800
What proof do you have
that he has done it?

559
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,440
If you don't believe it
then come to my room.

560
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,960
Guys, stop it. Leave it.
- Let him go!

561
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,960
Look at my laptop.
Notes. My parent's photo frame.

562
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,120
And look he has scribbled so badly
on Mittee's photograph.

563
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,600
What proof do you have that
Venu has done it? - Here...

564
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,960
What?

565
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,680
Sir, it was written on this room.

566
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,960
Yes. But where is it now?

567
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,160
I swear it was here.

568
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,800
Venu is right. He is actually mad.

569
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,440
How could you hit him?

570
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,760
Venu is nothing. He hit Mittee too.

571
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,560
Kavita, when did I hit Mittee?

572
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,320
Everyone knows what happened.
Mittee, let's go.

573
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,200
Sir! - Sir, I am telling you you
should take some action against it.

574
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,040
Tomorrow at 9 AM at Mr. Das cabin.
Be there.

575
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,800
Sir, listen to me.
- Let's go.

576
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,920
Mittee.

577
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,360
'Sahil got you caught.'

578
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,560
'He gestured to Venu.
And he complained to Miss D'souza.'

579
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,400
'Mittee has to repeat this year.
That's final.'

580
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,120
'How can I get more money?'

581
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,280
'Sir, I beg of you. Don't do this.'

582
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,920
'Give once chance to my daughter.'

583
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,880
Sahil Mehra, you bashed a wrong
girl. It will be fun now.

584
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,400
Mittee! Are you okay?

585
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,200
Yes. I am coming.

586
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,560
Are you alright?

587
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,360
I'm depressed Mittee.

588
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,840
Whatever is happening
is due to Venu.

589
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,960
He destroyed my room.
Broke my laptop.

590
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,600
Did you see how he scribbled
at your...

591
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,280
It was clearly written on the
wall your father is...

592
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,240
Who else besides Venu will do it?

593
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,400
If something was written on the
wall how did it disappear.

594
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,960
That's what I don't understand.

595
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,480
Mittee, I vow on you.
I am not lying.

596
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,960
At least you must trust me.

597
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,360
Of course I trust you. I really do.

598
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,400
Mittee.
- Yes.

599
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,760
Mittee, will you leave me?

600
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,160
I will never leave you. Never!

601
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,880
You look exhausted.
You must sleep now.

602
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,960
I am going crazy thinking
of the incident.

603
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,320
I love you!

604
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,680
I love you too.

605
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,520
Yes Mittee.

606
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,680
Mittee, what happened?

607
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,680
What is the room number
of Mittee Deora? Quick.

608
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,440
Quick.
- Yes.

609
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,400
Hello!

610
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
Mittee!

611
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,920
Mittee! Open the door.

612
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,520
Please open the door, Mittee.

613
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,040
Oh my God!

614
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,160
Who did this?

615
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,320
Mittee, tell me who did it?

616
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,120
Sahil!

617
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,840
What did he do?

618
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,280
He molested me.
- What?

619
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,480
It's paining.

620
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,360
Mittee! Mittee!

621
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,680
I informed Mr. Das.
Nothing will happen.

622
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,400
Mittee! Mittee!

623
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,320
You bastard.

624
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,720
Mittee!

625
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,560
Mittee!

626
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
You touched Mittee.

627
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,360
What are you doing?
- Are you crazy?

628
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,520
Sahil!
- Grab him. - Sir, are you okay?

629
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,320
Hey what's wrong with Sahil?
Stop it.

630
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,760
You touched Mittee.
- Sahil!

631
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,240
Stop it Sahil! - You touched Mittee.
- Stop him. What is he doing?

632
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,880
Are you mad?

633
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,680
How dare you?
- Sahil! - Grab him.

634
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,520
Sahil, hold him. - You will be
trapped. What are you doing?

635
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,480
Sahil!
- Sahil!

636
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,040
Sir!
- You?

637
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,280
Get up!
- Mr. Javed.

638
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,440
Is this a rape case?

639
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,600
I feel it is.

640
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,720
Tell me in one sentence
what happened?

641
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,280
Javed Siddhique molested
Mittee Deora.

642
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,480
And I bashed that guy.

643
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,960
You are arresting a wrong person.
Listen to me.

644
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,440
I was saving Mittee from that man.

645
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,760
Mr. Das, believe me.
You have a misunderstanding.

646
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,680
Sir, ask Mittee.
She will tell you the truth.

647
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,840
Venu! Venu, talk to them. Do you
think I can do something like this?

648
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,360
Friends, trust me.

649
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,480
Where are you going?
- Sir, I am from the college.

650
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,520
Harman was calling up. - What
happened? - They arrested Sahil.

651
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,840
And Mr. Javed?

652
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,640
He's in the ICU.
I'll go and check him.

653
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,440
Mittee! Mittee, are you fine?
I'll call the doctor.

654
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,520
Sir, I had gone to speak to Mittee.

655
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,960
To talk to her or for
something else?

656
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,040
Sir! I am not that kind of a boy.

657
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,360
Actually her dad is a heart
patient. He can't bear this news.

658
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,080
Alright. The secrecy of this
case will be maintained.

659
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,800
I'll treat you like a hero.

660
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,320
He had started dominating
Mittee too.

661
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,480
Sir, he behaved very unusual.
Either he was hyper or very quiet.

662
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,520
He looked calm.

663
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,600
No one understood what was
going on in his mind.

664
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,120
Whenever he lost his mind
he’s like an animal.

665
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,560
Absolutely out of control.

666
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,320
You have lot of anger.
Show it to me. Show it.

667
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,640
Sir, he was mad since a few weeks.
We were scared of him.

668
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,520
He called Venu his brother.
But he treated him badly.

669
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,240
To beat up a man like Mr. Javed
so much. Disgusting!

670
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,360
I had gone there as Mittee
asked me for help.

671
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,640
She was crying bitterly.

672
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,320
Did Mittee called you
on the intercom?

673
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,280
There is no record of the intercom.
So you will tell this.

674
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,240
Sir, take Mittee's statement once.

675
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,800
You will know the truth.

676
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,400
Mittee!

677
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,480
Miss Deora, what happened on
the night of 4th November?

678
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,880
Sahil came to my room
at around 10 PM.

679
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,080
We spoke to each other.

680
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,840
Then as usual.

681
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,840
He removed my top.
And tried to be physical with me.

682
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,160
What?

683
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,320
When I stopped him. He hit me.

684
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,480
He started abusing me.

685
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,680
Mittee! What are you saying?

686
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,840
Sahil called you...

687
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,640
to his room at night on 31st
July 2015 to study.

688
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,560
He kissed and raped you again
with your consensus.

689
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,400
Yes or no?

690
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,760
Mittee, that kiss was mutual.

691
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,600
She is lying. I didn't rape her.

692
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,440
Mr. Mehra, stay calm.

693
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,880
You will get a chance to speak.

694
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,920
Miss Deora, yes or no?

695
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,600
Yes.

696
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,680
Mittee,
why are you doing this to me?

697
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,920
Why are you lying?

698
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Something similar happened
on 4th November too.

699
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,120
Mittee stopped Sahil from
getting physical.

700
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,840
Sahil's male ego couldn't
tolerate it.

701
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,080
In that anger Sahil beat up...

702
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,440
Mittee, Javed Siddhiqui
and the 11 students.

703
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,560
All of them are lying.

704
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,440
They are cooking up
story to trap me.

705
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,560
Mr. Mehra,
this is the last warning.

706
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,160
If you speak out of
your turn again.

707
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,400
Or disturb the court's decorum.

708
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,200
I will charge you with
contempt of court.

709
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,920
Thank you sir.

710
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,920
Your honour.
I will tell you such a truth.

711
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,920
Hearing it everyone present
here will be shocked.

712
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,120
On 13th September 2007.

713
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,040
Sahil's mom, Anita Mehra.

714
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,800
Went into coma after she
slipped from the stairs.

715
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,840
After that Sahil Mehra was
severely disturbed.

716
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,120
Exactly 6 months later
15 year old Sahil...

717
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,000
under mysterious circumstances...

718
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,800
murdered his father mercilessly,
Anish Mehra.

719
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,520
He was imprisoned for
it for 3 years.

720
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,240
In 2008, 2009, 2010.

721
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,840
Sahil Mehra, is this story false?

722
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,120
Am I lying?

723
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,560
Mr. Mehra, please answer.

724
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,600
Your honour, the person who can kill
his father can go to any extend.

725
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,120
Sahil Mehra is a dangerous
criminal.

726
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,320
He is mentally sick.

727
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,040
Such a insane person living
a free life...

728
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,440
can be dangerous to society.

729
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,960
I request the honourable court.

730
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,600
To have a detail mental
examination of Sahil.

731
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,040
Only after that it reaches
to a conclusion.

732
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,760
That's all your honour.

733
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,800
After the examining the
medical reports...

734
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,160
the court has concluded...

735
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,480
Sahil Mehra is a patient of
Intermittent mental disorder.

736
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,560
Mischief. Obscene act. Assault.

737
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,040
And attempt to rape.

738
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,640
Under section 427.

739
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,160
294. 354.

740
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,520
And 511.

741
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,560
Would punishes some other criminal
with two and half year.

742
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,400
On the basis of Sahil Mehra's
mental disorder.

743
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,200
The court orders him to admit
him to Shimla Mental asylum.

744
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,440
Why did you do it?

745
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,240
'Listen guys,
we have to break Mittee's door.'

746
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,440
'-I just hope she hasn't harmed
herself. - Let's go.'

747
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,760
'Mittee! Mittee, please wake up.
- Mittee!'

748
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,680
'If possible please
give me a chance.'

749
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,120
'Alright. Tell me. Who's is it?'

750
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,120
'Sahil, it's mine.
Please stop them.'

751
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,200
'Stop it guys.'

752
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,840
Hold him tight. Stand stiff.

753
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,800
'Where did you get
the picture from?'

754
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,360
'I won't tell you.
What will you do?'

755
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,240
'Anus Venu.'

756
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,480
'What is Anus Venu?'

757
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,440
Come on.

758
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,200
'He entered my room and
destroyed everything.

759
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,040
What proof do you have
that he's done it?'

760
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,520
'Is this a rape case?
- I think so.'

761
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,440
'Sahil, Mr. Javed touched me.'

762
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,680
'Sir, please save me.'

763
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,760
'Ask Mittee she will
tell you the truth.'

764
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,640
'Looking gorgeous honey!'

765
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,680
It's all for you.

766
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,160
Today is your first meeting with
the company's director.

767
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,760
Are you nervous?

768
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,800
No. I am very excited.

769
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,080
I like the attitude.

770
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,760
As we all know the last chorus
for Stellar sweets...

771
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,800
In fact it was very difficult for
all the hospitality industry.

772
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,280
In the current market condition
9.5% growth year on...

773
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,880
is not easy.
But it's definitely possible.

774
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,960
To achieve this we have to
focus on three factors.

775
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,160
The power of the internet.
Revenue management and...

776
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,200
effective delegation.

777
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,880
This is the way to sustain in such
a complex and competitive market.

778
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,720
Sure. - Sure. - Correct!
- With this we can break for lunch?

779
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,960
Yes. - Yes. - Thank you
all. See you at 2 PM.

780
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,760
It got ruined towards the end.

781
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,560
It's okay. The rest was amazing.

782
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,680
Well done. Well done.
Apply the soap. - Birju!

783
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,920
What are you doing?
Do it properly.

784
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,480
Birju, don't fool again.

785
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,320
Get up. - Do it.
- The soap will go in the eyes.

786
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
What are you doing?
Be quick.

787
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,080
Patel, eat food.
Read the newspaper.

788
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,320
Nanu, give me some bread.

789
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,040
Ganju, how much will you eat?

790
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,800
You had 12 already.
Not anymore.

791
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,440
Ganju, why are you laughing?

792
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,200
I am not laughing but crying.
I am hungry.

793
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,160
Why are you crying?

794
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,360
I am not crying.
I am laughing. Look.

795
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,600
Hey! Mr. Hussain is leaving.
Say bye to him.

796
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,040
Bye. Bye.
- Bye-bye Hussain.

797
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,720
Bye!
- Bye!

798
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,960
Hussain, don't drink hot tea.

799
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,800
Your tongue gets burnt. Careful.

800
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,148
Hey! What happened?
- What happened?

801
00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:09,253
What happened?

802
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:12,840
Nothing. There is a patient who
gets violent on seeing red colour.

803
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,490
We need to be careful.
- Sorry!

804
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:16,480
Okay. - Come dad.
- Yes dear.

805
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,040
Dad, let's go.

806
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,440
Toothpaste.
- Don't send it today. Got it?

807
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,680
Nanu!

808
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,840
Haven't you slept?

809
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,160
Seeing the red colour...

810
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,600
I could control myself.

811
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,800
Is it?

812
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,480
I got angry even today.
But it has reduced.

813
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,640
This is good news.

814
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,280
You should talk to Dr. Irani.

815
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,720
Will he allow me to
leave this place?

816
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,040
You can try.
Why won't he let you go?

817
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,560
I feel Rinku is sleeping.
Go to sleep.

818
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,440
Good night.

819
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,960
Good night Nanu.

820
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,080
Honey! What day is today?

821
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,240
What? Is it our anniversary?

822
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,680
No. We informed our families about
us exactly six months ago.

823
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,280
Oh yes. Right. 11th.

824
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
We must celebrate tonight.
Call our friends home.

825
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,680
We will do it. Shall we do
something noble with it?

826
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,360
Cool! Shall we donate something
in your NGO Muskan?

827
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,720
One lakh is good.

828
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,160
Isn't it more?

829
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,000
Do it sweetheart.
I will be back in a moment.

830
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,240
Excuse me.
- Sure.

831
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,800
Mr. Govind,
it's such an honour to have you.

832
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,160
Excuse me?

833
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,640
Priyank?

834
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,280
What are you doing here? - Mittee,
you have played a big game.

835
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,480
From a trainee to a director.
Great!

836
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,560
I don't want to talk to you.
Go away from here.

837
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,320
Okay. When you find a rich man you
don't remember poor people.

838
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,120
Dear, I am your ex-lover.

839
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,840
Anuj is coming here.
Don't talk nonsense.

840
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,600
Good evening sir.
I am Priyank Sharma.

841
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,280
New Finnish Coffee Shop manager.

842
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,520
Hi!
- Shall we go? - Yes.

843
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,360
Sir! I wanted to talk to
you something important.

844
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,440
Yes tell me.

845
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,960
Sir, our relation is not like that.

846
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,760
But I want to share
something with you.

847
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,360
Sure.

848
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,200
Sir, the sale of our coffee shop
is up by 27% than last month.

849
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,240
That's great. Good job.
- Thank you sir.

850
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,680
Ma'am, I hope your experience
was comfortable.

851
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,920
Yes. Thanks.

852
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,560
Thank you ma'am. Thank you sir.
- Keep up the good work.

853
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,840
Bye sir. Bye ma'am. Bye. Good day!

854
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,920
Mittee Deora, watch it.

855
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
I will teach you a lesson for sure.

856
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,240
Red is just a colour.

857
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,320
Which we see all around us.

858
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,480
This colour has nothing
to do with that girl.

859
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,200
Okay.

860
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,720
Doctor Jha.

861
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,920
30% doctor.

862
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,280
Sahil, are you alright?

863
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,240
Dr. Jha, 50%.

864
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,760
Sahil, relax. Control your anger.

865
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Stop. Stop. Stop.

866
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,200
Increase it.

867
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,760
60.

868
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,760
Enough. Stop it.

869
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,440
60% intensity of red light.
And 80 seconds of time.

870
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,440
Last month you couldn't do 10
seconds on low intensity.

871
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,760
Good.

872
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,720
I could do it much better.

873
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,240
Very good. We'll try it next time.

874
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,120
Next patient please.
- Sahil, get up.

875
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,240
Doctor, there's so much improvement
in me. Let me go.

876
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,000
Relax boy! You have improved.
You are not healed.

877
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,760
Get up. Get up. Sahil, stand up.

878
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,920
What should I do to
get out of here?

879
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,080
Jha, just a moment.

880
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,360
Option 1.

881
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,480
You need a guarantor.

882
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,360
Like Mr. Hussain.
He is not with you.

883
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,480
So option 2. Impress me.

884
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,760
No complains and 100% results.

885
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,840
If you can do it for 3 months.

886
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,760
Then I can write to the authorities
and get you released.

887
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,480
Everything depends on me.

888
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,720
I will do it doctor.

889
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,280
Dad looks cool!

890
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,640
Excuse me?

891
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,640
Hello! - Hello dear your ex.
Priyank Desai.

892
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,960
That day you looked very rich.

893
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,320
Can I call you later? - Shall
I call up Mathur right away?

894
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,600
Alright. Tell me what's the issue?

895
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,960
I need one lakh.
Meet me at Coffee day at 6 PM.

896
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,160
I don't have it. - Even I don't have
it. That's why I am asking you.

897
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,360
If you don't come on time.
I will call up Mathur.

898
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,680
The rest depends on you.
Love you. Bye.

899
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,880
No brother.
We will do it on her next birthday.

900
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,840
Cancel. Cancel. Thank you. Bye.

901
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,360
What are you cancelling?

902
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,320
Actually I ordered a bracelet
for mom on her birthday.

903
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,400
As it's expensive I cancelled
the order.

904
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,720
How much does it cost?

905
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,040
Two lakhs.

906
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,800
It's out of my budget.

907
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,200
Take the money.
Give it on our behalf.

908
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,640
Anuj, I knew it. That's why I
don't tell you such things.

909
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,040
Babe, just take it.

910
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,600
Sahil!
- Yes. - Who is Surya?

911
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,520
Who is he?

912
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,400
Why?

913
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,920
He had a meeting with the
security head Mishra.

914
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,760
They want you to sign something.

915
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,360
They gave him lot of money.

916
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,520
Look here. They gave me too.

917
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,800
At 11 PM tomorrow all the CCTV...

918
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,960
camera will shut down for
10 minutes for servicing.

919
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,080
They will get him inside then.

920
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,240
What is the matter?

921
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,040
The food is here.
- Ganju, take this.

922
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,680
Yes. Yes.
- Patel.

923
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,160
Where is Sahil?
- He was sleeping.

924
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,840
What will we get in this?

925
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,600
Soup. Soup.
- What?

926
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,920
Soup.

927
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,720
Hussain, give me bread.

928
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,200
Are you unwell?

929
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,720
Why were you sleeping?

930
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,360
Slowly. It's hot.

931
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,320
What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

932
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,840
Sahil, what happened?

933
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,200
Oh my God!

934
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,160
Sahil, are you mad?

935
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,440
Sahil, stop. Stop!
- Hey! - Nanu!

936
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,560
Chandu. Nanu.

937
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,720
Sahil!

938
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:07,760
Give that to me.
- Sahil! Sahil!

939
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,960
Sahil! Hold his hand,
- What is wrong with him?

940
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,320
He saw the red soup.

941
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,680
I knew he won't mend.

942
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,280
Not three months he will
be here for three years.

943
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,080
Pick him up and lock him.

944
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,640
You haven't eaten since morning.
Eat it.

945
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,960
I know nothing happened to you
seeing the red coloured soup.

946
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,040
Then why did you do it?

947
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,200
Won't you tell Nanu?

948
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,200
Alright. Don't speak to me.

949
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,360
He is my brother.

950
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,440
What?

951
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,400
Surya is my brother.

952
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,880
You said you don't have a family.

953
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,720
The one who can kill his
father so mercilessly.

954
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,880
He can't be anyone's relative.

955
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,920
What do you mean?
That rascal committed the murder.

956
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,560
And blamed you for it.

957
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,760
I am going to meet Dr. Irani.

958
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,960
I will tell him about what he
and Mishra are planning.

959
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,960
Nanu!

960
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,120
Don't say a word to anyone.

961
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,600
Lock it.

962
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,400
What is it? Do you want this?

963
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,520
Yes. I want it.

964
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,160
I won't give it to you.

965
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,640
Do you want it?

966
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,600
Alright.

967
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,280
Manju!
- I want it. I do.

968
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,440
You want it.

969
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,200
Mishra, they are here.

970
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,960
Did you check the car's number?
- Yes sir. It's them.

971
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,920
Alright. Allow them to come.

972
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,520
He is here.

973
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,240
Don't worry.
I'll be in this room too.

974
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,240
Did you get him?
- Yes. He's here.

975
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,160
I sent you to prison 13 years ago.

976
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,800
That girl sent you to
the mental asylum.

977
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,400
Sahil Mehra,
what else will you face?

978
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,880
Why did you kill dad?

979
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,400
Sign here. I'll reply after that.

980
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,280
First answer me.
Then I'll sign the documents.

981
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,320
He had a sharp tongue.

982
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,680
So I stabbed him with a scissor.

983
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,240
And blamed it on me?

984
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,280
I should have benefit for being a
twin. Right? Isn't it a smart move?

985
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,040
Sign it.

986
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,200
When I called you up for
help three years ago...

987
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,360
you didn't even speak to me. Why
should I sign the documents now?

988
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,040
Sign it!

989
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,240
Hey! Don't slap the patient.

990
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,320
Move out!
- Hey!

991
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:12,200
You?
- Is someone here? Call Dr. Irani.

992
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,080
Hey, who is he?
- I don't know. - 'Call Dr, Irani.'

993
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,320
Call Dr, Irani.
I'll seen everything.

994
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,480
Is someone here? I'll seen
everything. Call Dr. Irani.

995
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,880
Security, what are you doing?

996
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,440
Nanu, take care over here,
I'll check there.

997
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,920
Alright.

998
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,040
Sign it. Or I'll beat him up.

999
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,400
Here. Sign it.

1000
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,840
I'll seen everything.
- What is wrong with him?

1001
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,360
I don't know what he has seen.
- I'll seen everything.

1002
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,240
What did you see?
- Call Dr. Irani. I'll tell him.

1003
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,960
Shut up! Or I'll hit you.

1004
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,160
Call Dr. Irani.
Bobby saw everything.

1005
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:00,040
Patel! Shut up! - Call Dr. Irani.
Bobby saw everything.

1006
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,720
Call Dr. Irani.
Bobby saw everything.

1007
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,520
Call Dr. Irani. Dr. Irani.

1008
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,120
Dr. Irani.
- Wait. I'll give you a shock.

1009
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,720
You don't have the machine here.

1010
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,480
Hey, call Dr. Irani.

1011
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,960
Thank you! Bye!

1012
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,040
Quick.

1013
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,080
You could wait for me.
Why did you hit him?

1014
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,960
I told him. You can speak to me.

1015
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,120
Jamal, go away.

1016
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,560
Okay.
Who are you to give this order?

1017
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,200
Keep an eye on the door.
I'll dress him up. - Alright.

1018
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,600
Go quickly.
- Okay.

1019
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,760
Mad.

1020
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,400
You are trying to trap me.

1021
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,320
You are like your father.

1022
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,880
You are like your father.

1023
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,120
Sahil!

1024
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,800
Open the door. Open the door.

1025
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,640
Why didn't you open the door?
Forget that. Sahil is getting mad.

1026
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,280
Take him away quickly.

1027
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,600
Let's go.
- Yes.

1028
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,920
Come.

1029
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:09,360
"Someone's end begins here.
The false blame on someone!"

1030
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,760
"Someone's life will be whirling!"

1031
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,400
'If you want this forever.
Then you have to help me.'

1032
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,280
'Alright. I'll do it.'

1033
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,520
'When all the lights are
switched off at night...

1034
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,440
Nanu will take me somewhere.'

1035
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,560
'After a short while the lights
outside your room will flicker.'

1036
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,840
'That is your signal.'

1037
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,880
'Immediately you will scream
at the top of your voice.'

1038
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,160
'Call Dr. Irani.
I've seen everything.'

1039
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,400
'Call Dr. Irani. Is someone here?'

1040
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,840
"I am mad. Be aware of me!"

1041
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:51,240
"I am mad.
I am mad. Be aware of me!"

1042
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,080
"I am not mad.
I'll bring out the truth!"

1043
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,480
"Don't understand me.

1044
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,280
I have no need. I need your
torture. I want you dead!"

1045
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:11,200
"I am mad.
I am mad. Be aware of me!"

1046
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:16,840
"I am mad.
I am mad. Be aware of me!"

1047
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,440
Sir, where do you I drop you?

1048
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,320
Home.

1049
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,720
Is someone here? Call Dr. Irani.

1050
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,480
Dad?

1051
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,920
'I thought of pushing
him from the stairs.'

1052
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:09,080
'People will think he slipped
just like mom did.'

1053
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,080
'Then I thought no.
What if he lives.'

1054
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,960
'You don't have to give
exam tomorrow.'

1055
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,360
'You will be imprisoned.'

1056
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,320
'And if you refuse...

1057
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,840
I will kill you.'

1058
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,560
'And if the police or
anyone finds out...

1059
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,600
then I'll kill your mom.'

1060
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,280
'Save your mother.'

1061
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,080
What did you see last night?

1062
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,520
Tell me.

1063
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,280
I will tell Dr. Irani.

1064
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,480
I am Dr. Irani.

1065
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,320
Am I mad?

1066
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,960
I'll tell Dr. Irani what I saw.

1067
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,760
Jha, he hasn't seen anything.
Take him away.

1068
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,080
I gave you Sahil’s appearance.

1069
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,920
Now watch how I turn
you into a mad man.

1070
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,160
No!

1071
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,160
Listen.
- Yes. - Give me your phone.

1072
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,600
Yes.

1073
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,400
Why are you staring at me?

1074
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,800
Sorry sir.

1075
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:53,600
"I am torched.
My hatred is very extreme!"

1076
01:21:53,680 --> 01:22:03,880
"Wherever you are.
I'll reach there!"

1077
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:13,200
"How can I leave you? I'll break
you. The way you left me!"

1078
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:17,560
"Listen cruel one,
it's my turn now!"

1079
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:21,640
"You are very sweet
but full of venom!"

1080
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:32,240
"Yes, I am mad. I am mad!"

1081
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:43,040
"I am mad. I am mad!"

1082
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,680
Surprise!

1083
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,960
Kuttee Deora!

1084
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,280
What is this?

1085
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,920
This is Kavita's prank.
She's totally mad.

1086
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,720
She clicked this picture.

1087
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,080
Who is Kavita?

1088
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,640
Kavita!
My best friend from college.

1089
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,240
I told you about her.

1090
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,160
'If there is emotion
in business then

1091
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,400
it's not business but some serial.'

1092
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,440
'Do you understand?'

1093
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,360
Come. Come. Come.

1094
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,440
Sahil Mehra!

1095
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,440
Yes.

1096
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:09,960
"You are delicate to look at.
But you are a savage inside!"

1097
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:20,120
"I have borne your brutality.
I have done a lot for you!"

1098
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:29,560
"I was your protector. But not
anymore. I will plan to end you!"

1099
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,880
"I won't let you cry.

1100
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:37,960
Nor let you sleep.
I will give you sleepless nights!"

1101
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:40,960
2172.

1102
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:53,680
"Yes. I am mad. I am mad!"

1103
01:24:53,760 --> 01:25:01,760
"I am mad. I am mad!"

1104
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:17,120
"You are falling on my knees!"

1105
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:22,960
"Which you only know
who's your love!"

1106
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:29,160
"Some of my heart is falling
for another heart!"

1107
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:33,320
"For my soul!"

1108
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:43,040
"You can't beat me down!
I've been for love!"

1109
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,960
"You can't beat me down!"

1110
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,960
"You can't beat me down!"

1111
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,480
The battery?

1112
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,560
Honey, are you back?

1113
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,760
Come inside.

1114
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,600
Why did you do this to me, Mittee?

1115
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,960
Why did you do it with me?
Why? Why?

1116
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,680
Why did you do it?

1117
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,480
Speak up. Speak up.

1118
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,360
There's no one outside.

1119
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,440
Anuj,
I want to share something with you.

1120
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,640
A boy called Sahil was interested
in me at college.

1121
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,920
He always stared at me.
Tried to talk to me.

1122
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,040
One day he proposed to me.

1123
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,600
But I refused.

1124
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,320
I didn't know he would go mad
on hearing my refusal.

1125
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,320
He would beat up students
and teachers.

1126
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,640
This is nothing.

1127
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:39,200
I found out at the court he
murdered his father when he was 14.

1128
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:41,920
He was mad.

1129
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,200
He was sent to the mental asylum.

1130
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,960
It's three years now.

1131
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,640
Anuj, I'm sure.
He is discharged from there.

1132
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,040
He is doing things that
are happening here.

1133
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,800
Which asylum was he in?

1134
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,600
Shimla Mental Asylum.

1135
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,120
Shimla Mental Asylum.

1136
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,080
Sir, I wanted information
on Sahil Mehra.

1137
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,160
Who is speaking?

1138
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,680
I am his cousin speaking.

1139
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,040
Is he still admitted or
discharged from there?

1140
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,240
He is right here.

1141
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:16,680
Thank you! Thank you sir.

1142
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,040
Anuj, I'm sure he's not there.
But here.

1143
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,920
Mittee, how can one person
be at two places?

1144
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,640
Anuj! Come with me.
I want to check something.

1145
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,280
There is no movement.

1146
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,520
Wait. Play the footage further.

1147
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,400
How did you do it?

1148
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,680
It is complicated to explain it.
Let it be.

1149
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,600
This? I told you.

1150
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,240
Mittee, this is me.

1151
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Take this.

1152
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,880
No bro. It's complimentary.

1153
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,280
Why?

1154
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,640
Actually what she did to you.

1155
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,920
Some other girl did it to me too.

1156
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,720
Everyone says women are
unsafe in our country.

1157
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,600
I feel even men are not very safe.

1158
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,040
You are right, bro.

1159
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,080
I can feel you man.

1160
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:55,840
Yes dad.

1161
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:02,400
Dad, can you attend this meeting
instead of me? Please!

1162
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,920
Alright. Fine dad. Okay bye.

1163
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,800
Honey!
I have to go to Mumbai for 2 days.

1164
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,720
Mumbai?

1165
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,200
Hello sir!

1166
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,560
Good evening sir.

1167
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,040
Anything else?

1168
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,960
Sir, I wanted to show you
the sample of chainsaw.

1169
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,240
We have tested it.
The quality is very good.

1170
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,960
Sir, a dealer from Gurgaon...

1171
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,800
is ready to give us the same
design for 1/3rd prize.

1172
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,520
It will be best for profits too.

1173
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,760
How many pieces are we importing?

1174
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,280
Sir, we are exporting it.

1175
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,280
Yes. I meant export.

1176
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,360
Alright. How many pieces?

1177
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,440
5 lakh. You said that.

1178
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,680
I told you. Yes.

1179
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,600
And how is the quality
of the Gurgaon dealer?

1180
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,080
Sir, definitely the quality
is not as good as this one.

1181
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,320
But we can manage.

1182
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,400
I don't think of short
term but long term.

1183
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,320
If our quality is good
our sales will boom.

1184
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,480
And also profitability too.

1185
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,760
Right uncle?

1186
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,480
Right sir.

1187
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,760
Listen Priyank, I'm very busy
today. Don't irritate me.

1188
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,720
Your bank account is
going to Mumbai.

1189
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,320
You must be enjoying a lot.

1190
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,200
What do you want?

1191
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,560
Two lakhs.
- I don't have it.

1192
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:42,040
Alright. I have Anuj's number.
Shall I ask him?

1193
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,000
Priyank,
try to understand my situation.

1194
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,920
Meet me at 10 AM at VIP theatre
near Hanuman Temple.

1195
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,400
Priyank, listen.
- Stall. Seat number P17.

1196
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,280
Love you! Bye dear.
- Priyank.

1197
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:57,600
Even your father paid.
It's done now.

1198
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,600
Good day uncle.

1199
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,960
I am Mittee's college friend.
Smiley!

1200
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:03,520
Hello!

1201
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,360
I was passing from here so
I thought of meeting you.

1202
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,000
It's good. Come inside.
- Right.

1203
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,680
Son, what do you do for a living?

1204
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,920
I settle accounts.

1205
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:21,760
I mean to say I work at my uncle's
hotel in accounts department.

1206
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,160
Oh! I see.

1207
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,400
Mittee must be returning home
anytime. Did you speak to her?

1208
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,840
I spoke to her a while ago.

1209
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,960
Please handover this
envelope to her.

1210
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,200
This?
- Yes.

1211
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,440
What is this?
- Cash of 10,000.

1212
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,600
Mittee donates on important
day’s right?

1213
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,200
It's my birthday's donation
to Muskan NGO.

1214
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,160
Muskan?

1215
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:51,040
I don't know what charity
Mittee's does.

1216
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,200
True.

1217
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,120
Honestly, you can't know.

1218
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,520
Son, will you have tea?
- Yes.

1219
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,840
Aunt, next time. I have to leave
now. Thank you very much.

1220
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,080
Hey! Grandmother!

1221
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,160
I was sad to hear about her death.

1222
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:15,600
Mittee was very close to her right?
- You have a misunderstanding.

1223
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,200
Mittee didn't even see
her grandmother.

1224
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,240
She was in my womb when her
grandmother expired.

1225
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,080
Oh! Is it?

1226
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:35,440
Now I understand.

1227
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,840
Parking?

1228
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,080
Parking?
- Go straight to the basement.

1229
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,800
'Brother-in-law, let me go.
Or sister will be here.'

1230
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:50,160
'Do it quickly.'

1231
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,240
Move aside.

1232
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,280
'Brother-in-law, it's enough.
Let me leave now.'

1233
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,960
'It's just the beginning.'

1234
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,920
Where can I get the money from?

1235
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,600
I am calling up Anuj.
- Priyank?

1236
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:05,920
Priyank, please. Priyank.

1237
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Oh no!

1238
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,520
It's Rolex! Remove it.

1239
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,160
No. It's belongs to Manoj.

1240
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,960
Hey, you won't comply easily. Wait.

1241
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,440
Wait I'll call up Anuj.

1242
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,600
Priyank. I'll give it.

1243
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,560
'We aren't done yet.'

1244
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,760
It is worth 20 lakhs.

1245
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,840
Anuj will disapprove of it.

1246
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,880
20 lakhs. You are wearing my
3 years salary on your hand.

1247
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,200
Priyank.

1248
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,640
Why are you doing this?

1249
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,600
Hey, don't shed crocodile tears.
Just shut up.

1250
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,560
Did you forget what you did to me?

1251
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,960
Go away from here. Go!

1252
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,560
Somebody help!

1253
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,600
Is someone here?

1254
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,040
Mittee! Mittee, please help me.

1255
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:21,760
Mittee! Please help me.
- Kavita!

1256
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,800
Help me Mittee.

1257
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,200
Please save me.

1258
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,640
Help!

1259
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,680
Please help me!

1260
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,760
Mittee, please help me. Help!

1261
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,440
Hey! Why did you do it?

1262
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:43,440
But what were you doing
at that basement?

1263
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,000
It was Saturday.
So I had gone to the temple.

1264
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,760
I didn't find a parking there.
So I parked at VIP theatre.

1265
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,240
I didn't know he would come there.

1266
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,920
Anuj, he has reached my house.

1267
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,600
If anything happens
to my parents I...

1268
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:02,560
Yes sir.

1269
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,840
Okay. Alright thank you.

1270
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,480
What?

1271
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:12,400
The police says they don't
have any such complaint.

1272
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:16,840
Anuj! Did he kill Kavita?

1273
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,560
Hello! Is Kavita home?

1274
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:25,560
What?

1275
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,240
Kavita?

1276
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,840
What are you doing here?

1277
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,680
Last night Sahil chopped
your leg right?

1278
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:38,240
What? Chopped my leg?

1279
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,400
Who is Sahil?

1280
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:40,800
Sahil Mehra.

1281
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,960
Mittee, Sahil Mehra is in the
mental asylum since 3 years.

1282
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:45,960
Are you taking drugs?

1283
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,880
Mittee.
- Honestly.

1284
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:52,080
Sahil chopped her leg. I swear.

1285
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:57,320
I'm sorry sir.
But take her to a doctor.

1286
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,640
I feel she has gone mad just
like her ex-boyfriend.

1287
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,520
Ex-boyfriend?

1288
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:03,040
Yes. Sahil.

1289
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:05,960
Didn't she tell you about it?

1290
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:08,520
Anuj, let's go.

1291
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,280
Hey!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1292
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:13,400
Come on. - Mittee. - This
girl is very cunning.

1293
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,760
Yes. Are you enjoying it?

1294
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,840
A lot.

1295
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,320
But seriously.

1296
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,800
I am telling you despite being
a strong headed feminist.

1297
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,360
Don't let her go.

1298
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,720
After tormenting so many people
if she is left free...

1299
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,880
she will feel she has won.

1300
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:47,600
Don't worry.

1301
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,600
I won't let her win.

1302
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,080
Anuj, I'm sure I parked the
car here last night.

1303
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,720
Ma'am,
no car is allowed at this place.

1304
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,800
We are renovating the
place since 3 weeks.

1305
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,280
A board is put up here.
Work in progress.

1306
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,880
There was no such board here.

1307
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,920
And he asked me to park
at the basement.

1308
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,800
This man?
- Yes.

1309
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,080
Impossible!
He works during the day.

1310
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,080
Anuj, Sahil was pretending to
chop Kavita legs over here.

1311
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,800
I feel she has lost it.

1312
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,160
Anuj, they are a team.

1313
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,760
They are trying to frame me.

1314
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,480
You are saying the security here,
building security...

1315
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,600
police,
asylum and Kavita are in it.

1316
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,600
They have no work beside
trapping you.

1317
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,920
What nonsense!

1318
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,640
Anuj, listen to me. Anuj!

1319
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,480
Yes Sahil. They left just now.

1320
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,640
Was it him?

1321
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,680
No dear. He was a Sardar.

1322
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,920
Sardar?
- Yes.

1323
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,680
Okay. Can he look like this without
his beard and moustache?

1324
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,360
But Mittee, what is wrong? Tell us.

1325
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,520
Answer my question.
Don't question me.

1326
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:09,720
Look again.

1327
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:12,360
Was it him?

1328
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:15,600
No.
- No.

1329
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,680
Why are you nodding?
Look carefully. It was him.

1330
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:21,400
Enough. Enough.

1331
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:24,360
Come with me.

1332
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:31,200
The live CCTV feed of
high security unit.

1333
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,560
The patient is in front of you.

1334
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,680
Is he Sahil?

1335
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:42,960
Yes. But how can he be here?

1336
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,840
Thank you doctor.
- Welcome! - Let's go.

1337
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,160
I will go inside and see him.
- Impossible ma'am.

1338
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,360
The patients of that ward
are majorly dangerous

1339
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:51,880
criminals and mentally disturbed.

1340
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,640
Anuj, talk to him.

1341
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,600
Mittee, you saw Sahil here.

1342
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:02,040
I don't want to hear
his name again.

1343
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:03,720
Understand?

1344
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:11,320
Bittu, phone. Take the call.

1345
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:20,640
At 2 AM how did you remember me?

1346
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:22,760
Did he leave you?

1347
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,960
What? Is she mad?

1348
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,280
What problem is she getting into?

1349
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:33,840
2 lakh.

1350
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,840
Alright. Meet me at 10 AM tomorrow.

1351
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,360
Yes brother.
Mittee called me up just now.

1352
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,120
Whom will you shoot?

1353
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,080
It's for safety.

1354
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,680
Look,
whatever you do do it deliberately.

1355
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,320
Deliver the snack.
Yes, that car over there.

1356
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:28,480
Yes Kavita!

1357
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,800
There's a breaking news.

1358
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,480
What? - This Sunday Mittee and Anuj
Mathur are getting engaged.

1359
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,320
What are you saying?

1360
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,920
Moreover they will marry two
weeks later at London.

1361
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,040
They will settle there permanently.

1362
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,720
Are you serious?

1363
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:49,360
It means Anuj is ready to marry
her after all that happened.

1364
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,200
Yes!

1365
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,640
This girl must have performed well.

1366
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,680
Do something before she
runs away from India.

1367
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,160
We don't have much time.

1368
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:00,920
Kavita, hold on.

1369
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,720
Sir, I wanted your signature.

1370
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:04,760
It's urgent.

1371
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,440
Okay. Who told you?

1372
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,280
Anuj Mathur's dad had come to
invite my Hotel's promoter.

1373
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,000
Luckily I was present there.
So I heard them speaking.

1374
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,200
Is someone present there?
- Yes.

1375
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,600
If you want we can talk later.

1376
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:32,520
Alright.
I will call you later. Bye.

1377
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,040
Is there a problem?

1378
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,280
There's no problem Mr. Sahil Mehra.

1379
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,040
Sahil?

1380
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,440
Yes.
You can keep your neck straight.

1381
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:57,360
I alerted myself when
you spoke of quality.

1382
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:01,560
Surya never spoke of quality.
He spoke of only money.

1383
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,480
I doubted you earlier.

1384
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,400
Today you confirmed it.

1385
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,480
You did your signatures.

1386
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,040
Oh no!

1387
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,920
Where is Surya?

1388
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,320
At Shimla Mental Asylum.

1389
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,400
Asylum? What do you mean?

1390
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,560
Please don't tell anyone anything.
Please!

1391
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,360
I always felt you are innocent.

1392
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,600
You can't kill anyone.

1393
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,320
But I couldn't do much.

1394
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,680
I had no evidence.

1395
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,480
Don't worry. I'll do something.

1396
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,440
Three years ago when that
girl did the act...

1397
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,480
I tried to help you.

1398
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,680
But Surya found out.

1399
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:55,960
You were my father's servant.
Remain a servant.

1400
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,680
Don't try to enter the family.

1401
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,600
Hereafter if you try
to talk to Sahil.

1402
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,160
I will do exactly the same thing
what I did to my father.

1403
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,160
And your state will
be just like Sahil.

1404
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,960
I am pleased that rascal
is in that asylum now.

1405
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,680
And you are free.

1406
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,720
Sorry! I couldn't do much for you.

1407
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:30,560
But if I can do something
for you...

1408
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:32,760
don't hesitate to tell me.

1409
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,000
Congratulations!

1410
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:42,240
Congratulations to the beautiful
couple. Anuj and Mittee.

1411
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,800
You guys are truly made
for each other.

1412
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:48,040
Well, this is blessed day
for both the families.

1413
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,240
The Mathur's and the Deora's.

1414
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:53,680
Presenting to you all something
really special.

1415
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,640
Dim the lights please!

1416
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,040
Oh!

1417
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:29,480
Hi Mittee!
And hi the lucky man, Anuj Mathur.

1418
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:33,400
I am very happy today.
Finally Mittee found her dream man.

1419
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,160
Do you remember what
you said on the

1420
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,760
10th anniversary of Stellar sweets?

1421
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,280
I want to be rich babe.

1422
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,360
Look,
I will date my boss Anuj Mathur.

1423
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:42,880
You were a trainee.

1424
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,960
Guess what? Today you are
getting engaged to him.

1425
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,760
Now you are rich, babe.

1426
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,080
Hello Mittee.
Do you remember 35% marks?

1427
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:54,400
No money in the pocket. Trying to
pacify me twice in a day at office.

1428
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:58,040
Bilal, get me a job. Get me a job.

1429
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,760
And in a month Bilal
became your lover.

1430
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,760
We started dating.

1431
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,480
I managed to get a trainee's
position at Stellar sweets.

1432
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:09,840
After that you turned off the phone.
Number got changed. No contact.

1433
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:11,800
When I met you, you said...

1434
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:14,640
My parents won't allow me
to marry a Muslim guy.

1435
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,880
Sorry Bilal!

1436
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:20,080
Next month you found
your next lover.

1437
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:24,520
Mittee's best friend Kavita
and I were engaged.

1438
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,800
One day Kavita introduced
me to Mittee.

1439
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,240
After dinner when I went
to drop Mittee home.

1440
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,760
She started talking sexy
things with me.

1441
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:36,640
I...

1442
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:41,760
Within a week Anand broke
off the engagement.

1443
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,840
My cousin's took me for clubbing to
help me cope with my depression.

1444
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:48,320
Guess whom I see Anand
dancing with?

1445
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,720
Mittee Deora.

1446
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,960
She trapped Sahil Mehra the richest
boy of the class in Shimla.

1447
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:56,760
When they had an argument...

1448
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,920
she proved that normal
boy as unstable

1449
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,280
and sent him to the asylum.

1450
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:02,760
He is in the asylum
since three years.

1451
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:05,320
After Sahil was out of the way.
I was the next one.

1452
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:09,160
We didn't have a proper
relationship. We were just enjoying.

1453
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,560
During that time Mittee
took a loan of 35,000.

1454
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,600
When she had to return it she got
away with her dad's health stories.

1455
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:20,800
Look here. Your Rolex watch.
Mittee gave it to me.

1456
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,920
Your fiancée was 15 year
old and I was 22.

1457
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,520
We had an affair since then.

1458
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,560
I earned 10,000 a month.

1459
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,720
I gave her 5,000 out of it.

1460
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,320
One day my mom fell sick.
I exhausted my money.

1461
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,640
Mittee started blackmailing me.

1462
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,880
Give me money. Or I will imprison
you for sex with minor.

1463
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:43,200
I sold mom's earrings and
arranged the money.

1464
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,440
She is such a cheap girl.

1465
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,160
On our 5th month anniversary
she said...

1466
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:51,040
Please let's donate 25,000.

1467
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:53,760
When I transferred the money...

1468
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:56,200
She got a sms on her mobile.

1469
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,080
That alerted me too.

1470
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:00,480
I checked her phone.

1471
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:04,360
25,000 credited to Muskan NGO.

1472
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:08,240
It means she was the
false trustee...

1473
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,840
of that false NGO.

1474
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:12,480
I left her right there.

1475
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,960
And chapter closed.

1476
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:17,760
Sir, if you have to live alone
in life then live alone.

1477
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,200
But don't marry this girl
even by mistake.

1478
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,760
We told you the whole story.

1479
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,480
And you are intelligent.

1480
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,920
So save yourself and your family,
Mr. Mathur.

1481
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,200
All the best, dear boss!

1482
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:46,240
Anuj.

1483
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:00,120
Go to hell.

1484
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:13,360
Shame on you!

1485
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,120
What is wrong with you?
What happened?

1486
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,880
Dad!
- Call the doctor.

1487
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:29,040
Dad! - Call the doctor.
- What happened? - Call the doctor.

1488
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:30,600
What happened?

1489
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,280
Call the ambulance.

1490
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,400
Leave us alone.

1491
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,520
For God's sake leave us alone.

1492
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:51,880
Hello!
- Hi Mittee.

1493
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,720
You bastard!

1494
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,960
Your dad is dying at the hospital.

1495
01:51:58,040 --> 01:51:59,760
And you are sleeping
peacefully at home.

1496
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,160
Aren't you worried about your dad?

1497
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,440
Don't speak about my dad.

1498
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:07,880
If you have the courage come to me.
I won't spare you.

1499
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,560
I won't spare you instead.

1500
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,760
I stole your bank account
I mean Anuj Mathur.

1501
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:18,960
Then showed your true face to
everyone and humiliated you.

1502
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,360
Now I'll steal from you the
most precious thing.

1503
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:27,240
Dad!

1504
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:32,400
I will kill you if anything
happens to dad.

1505
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:38,280
Hello! Hello!

1506
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,840
Dr. Sarah, come to O.T. right away.

1507
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:58,400
Dad!

1508
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,040
Mittee, leave from here.

1509
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:13,560
You gave us enough sorrow.

1510
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,160
Mom, please let me meet dad once.

1511
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:20,240
He doesn't want to meet you.
Got it?

1512
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,360
Go away from here.

1513
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:26,920
Mom, please. Don't do this.
- Please!

1514
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,040
Dad!
- Go away from here.

1515
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:34,480
'Response ward. 2nd row.'

1516
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,600
'Hi Kuttee. I mean Mittee.'

1517
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,360
'Are you enjoying yourself?'

1518
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,040
'Why did you do this to me?'

1519
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,120
Come in front of me once.

1520
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:55,120
'You are crazy to get
rid of me earlier.'

1521
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:57,280
'Now you want to see me?'

1522
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:59,960
Where are you?
- 'Turn'.

1523
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:05,040
What joke is this? Hello! Hello!

1524
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:09,200
Hello!

1525
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:13,280
Our story is so dramatic.

1526
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:16,160
Come.
Let's make the climax interesting.

1527
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,720
You hit a girl. Rascal!

1528
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:20,960
Ma'am, are you alright?

1529
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:31,840
'Who got shot?'

1530
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,240
Go away from here.
- No. No.

1531
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,960
Mittee Deora, come here.

1532
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:49,360
No. No wait here. Don't
go outside the room.

1533
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:53,200
Mittee! Here. Here.

1534
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,080
Where are you running away?

1535
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,800
I am here to beat you.

1536
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,680
Ma'am,
you are not allowed to come here.

1537
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,400
It's a restricted area.
- Shut up.

1538
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,160
Ahh!
- Hey!

1539
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,280
Hey, wait.

1540
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,960
The girl is here.
She has gone upstairs.

1541
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,080
Sahil!

1542
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:09,520
Mittee!

1543
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,120
Switch on the fan.

1544
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,400
Shut up!

1545
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:13,800
Someone is here to meet you.

1546
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,880
Uh! Is it my dad?

1547
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,880
Surya Mehra. I am his twin brother.

1548
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:58,240
He didn't tell anyone about me.

1549
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,040
He hated me.

1550
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:06,320
As I killed my father
and blamed it on him.

1551
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:13,080
I went to meet him at the asylum
for some signatures.

1552
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,680
He trapped me and ran
away from there.

1553
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:22,760
He worried you and
me for two months.

1554
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:27,760
But the way you killed him...

1555
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,760
I was very happy to hear about it.

1556
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,520
I wanted to meet you personally
to thank you.

1557
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:39,680
Thanks!

1558
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:45,520
I heard you got a life term.

1559
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,520
And your parents didn't
come for your hearing.

1560
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,240
Sad!

1561
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,680
But don't worry.

1562
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,640
I will help you somehow.

1563
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:03,800
You fulfilled my revenge
by killing Sahil.

1564
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:06,440
Say bye to him. Your time is up.

1565
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:12,760
Bye!

1566
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,360
Leave me.

1567
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,480
Leave me.

1568
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:50,200
'You have to get Surya out from
the asylum.' - 'What?'

1569
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:52,080
'Mittee had taken a gun.'

1570
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:56,320
'I'm sure she will try to kill me
after her engagement breaks.'

1571
02:00:57,200 --> 02:01:00,280
'She will fire at Surya not me.'

1572
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:02,120
Leave me.

1573
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:07,800
'I am ready to take the
responsibility of Sahil Mehra.

1574
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:08,880
I am his uncle.'

1575
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:16,800
"I am mad.
I am mad! Be aware of me!"

1576
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:19,920
'I have blood cancer. I am going
to London for the treatment.'

1577
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:22,080
'Before going home come
to the hospital

1578
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:23,920
and take the legal papers from me.'

1579
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:25,800
'Which hospital?'

1580
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,680
'Where are you?' - 'I am on the
first floor. Where are you?'

1581
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:34,680
'Come on the third floor.'

1582
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:42,040
"My quality is that I am crazy.
I do mistakes!"

1583
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:44,520
"I am out of my mind and
my life is messed!"

1584
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,080
"I walk carefree. Stare at me!"

1585
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:49,760
"I did what you taught me.
This fight was fair!"

1586
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:55,800
'Where are you?
Someone is firing here.'

1587
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:57,680
'Come to 218. Quickly.'

1588
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:01,960
'Where is Sahil Mehra?'

1589
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:03,520
'Sahil!'

1590
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:13,360
'The fight was fair!"

1591
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:19,080
"I am mad.
I am mad. Be aware of me!"

1592
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:24,520
"I am mad.
I am mad. Be aware of me!"

1593
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:20,400
"I am torched.
My hatred is very extreme!"

1594
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:30,800
"Wherever you are.
I'll reach there!"

1595
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:39,880
"How can I leave you? I'll break
you! The way you broke me!"

1596
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:44,360
"Listen cruel one.
Now it's my turn!"

1597
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:48,600
"You are very sweet.
But full of venom!"

1598
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:59,360
"Yes. I am mad. I am mad!"

1599
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:09,240
"I am mad. I am mad!"

1600
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:38,480
"Why did you do this?
You cheated me!"

1601
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:46,600
"Why did you wound me?"

1602
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:15,600
"You are delicate to look at.
But you are a savage inside!"

1603
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:25,960
"I have borne your brutality.
I have done a lot for you!"

1604
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:30,560
"I was your protector.
But not anymore!"

1605
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:35,200
"I will think of ending your life!"

1606
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:39,800
"I won't let you cry.
Nor allow you to sleep!"

1607
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:43,680
"I will give you sleepless nights!"

1608
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:53,400
"Yes. I am mad. I am mad!"

1609
02:05:54,680 --> 02:06:04,960
"I am mad. I am mad!"
