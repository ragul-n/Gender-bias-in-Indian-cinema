Man! Is that a name or a mail train?

00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,083
'Raju' is a nice and short.

00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:47,616

Okay. So, give two teas there!

Tea.

00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,560
Enough! Come! We'll go home...

16
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,229
I can't put you through this.

Don't worry Maa... I can do it!

Go, I said!
I'll ﬁnish and come home.

Go!

25
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,423

00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,326
Wash the glasses.

27
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,144
Raju! One cutting over there!

28
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,614
Thank you.

29
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,021

Send two teas- special.

32
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,730
Can I get one without sugar?

33
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,329
Two coca colas!

34
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,340
How have you washed this?!
Wash it again!

35
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,992
Hey! Hurry up!

00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,287
What did you say?

39
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,189
When can I go home?

40
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,058
Wait! There's still time.

41
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,065
A lot of people will come here now.

42
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,464
In the night?

43
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,166

Raju! Over there.

55
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,108

00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,491
Welcome back to class, sir...

61
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,554
Hope you are feeling well sir.

62
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,401
Leaning Tower of Pisa.
- Bro!

63
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,801
What are you doing bro?

64
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,274
What's this Shivam?

65
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,438
Sir I was waiting for this day...

66
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,140
What was the need
for all this champ?

67
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,081
Sir by saving my son's life...

68
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,140
Statue!

69
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,817
Off!

70
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,148
Hey kids...

71
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,522
Have you met my
older brother?

72
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,787
Aniruddha Bhargava...

73
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,220
Bugs for short.

74
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,726
When he was 5 years old,

75
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,725
he was the fastest junior skater
in the nation..

76
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,490
And after that...27 State Gold's.

77
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,434
17 National Gold's.

78
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,439
5 Asian Gold's.

79
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,199
He is my true inspiration guys.

80
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,005
My super champ! My Guru! My Bro!

81
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,108
Wow! So why don't you come to class?

82
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,739
I don't live here.

83
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,708
The great American Bug!

84
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,515
He has been living in New York City
for the past 4 years.

85
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,486
Has come to play nurse
because of this.

86
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,456
Does he teach skating there?

87
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,755
No! No! He's an investment banker!

88
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,495
Big man!

89
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,758
Bro... this is our skating gang

90
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,124
Roll-o-ﬁt!

91
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,463
Hi Bugs sir...
- Hi Bro sir!

92
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,232
Hi Great American Bug.

93
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,811
Okay! ...North South East West...

94
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,177
ROLL-O-FIT IS THE BEST!!!

95
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,243
That's the spirit!

96
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,286
I missed you my little champs!

97
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,086
It's so good to be back!

98
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,355
The fab stench of the creek!

99
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,090
These blood-sucking mosquitoes...

100
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,492
and tea!

101
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,292
Bro you want tea?

102
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,534
Bhatt! Send tea!

103
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:20,009
Okay then.
On your marks... get set...

104
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,407
Go for it.

105
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,517
Hit your legs! Hit your legs!

106
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,446
Put your weight on your hips!

107
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,020
Strong, creamy, doubly sugared tea!

108
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,452
For Lucky Sir.

109
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,493
He's come after ages.

110
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,553
Must be aching
for this glass of tea.

111
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,768
Sagar, hit your legs.

112
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,109
Look at Rutvi!

113
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,473
Burger Badshah!
Why are you tailing so much?

114
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,708
Hit the tar!

115
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,546
Strong... creamy...
doubly sugared tea.

116
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,323
Hey, who are you?

117
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,519
Raju.

118
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,527
Hit your legs!

119
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,581
Hey Raju! Come here!

120
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,316
Go get empty glasses from there...

121
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,621
Burger Badshah!

122
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,325
Are you hurt?

123
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,425
Have you forgotten
skating in a month?

124
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,108
Move aside.

125
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,491
Hey... what are you doing?

126
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,386
I said, what are you doing?

127
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,023
Keep it down!

128
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,687
Costs a hundred thousand!
Keep it down!

129
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,563
Here! Take this glass.

130
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:18,019
Okay class over. I'm going to see
you tomorrow. Good night.

131
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,713
You're back child!

132
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,188
Hey my Mauli...

133
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,621
Wait, I'll just come...

134
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,088
Granny, you have your dinner.
I'll look after her.

135
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,018
Mau
i...come to me...

136
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,254
You've come?

137
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,068
<i>Faster... iaster...</i>

138
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,305
Hit the tar!

139
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,379
That's how he was instructing.

140
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,079
This one's nice and hot... Eat it!

141
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,220
Let me see!

142
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,569
No need to go tomorrow!

143
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,161
It's nothing Ma...

144
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,696
These big city guys
have really hot tea.

145
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,338
I'd almost forgotten...

146
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,214
Listen! They were really very fast.

147
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,356
Hit the tar! Hit the tar!

148
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,995
I wish you could've seen...

149
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,495
Costs a hundred thousand!

150
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,759
Don't ﬁb...

151
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,265
I got a used one in scrap
and gave eight bucks for it...

152
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,431
A hundred thousand! Baaah!

153
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,771
You get a brand new car
in a hundred thousand!

154
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,773
No really!
The boy's driver said so.

155
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,071
He said...
and you believed!

156
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,047
Next he'll invite you to live
in his mansion...

157
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,413
Angie on your left,
JLo on your right!

158
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,781
What a sight!

159
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,789
You've barely been here a month...

160
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,150
And you're believing all this!

161
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,255
So come and see this evening.

162
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,319
But where?
- At the Bandm Kurla Complex..

163
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,195
..after the ofﬁces shut.

164
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,427
Only if you treat us to tea.

165
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,524
He just landed a job yesterday,

166
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,228
and you're picking his pocket
already Gochi!

167
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,471
No, no... tea is on me!

168
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,505
You'll come Bhum?

169
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,269
If I manage to sell off my wares.

170
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,434
Hey guys, want Butter Chicken?

171
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,571
A doddering drunkard chucked it
out of his car at 3 am

172
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,138
said have a party!

173
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:44,142
Hey out of here.

174
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,127
What's cooking?

175
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,103
I've got some pasta, broccoli
and mushroom in white sauce...

176
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,029
I'll toss it fresh after class.

177
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,532
Why bother with
this cooking routine?

178
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,574
To make you feel at home Brother.

179
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,771
No need!

180
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,445
The doctor ordered
a month's bed-rest!

181
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,711
And what's the need
to go to the class?

182
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,218
No. This won't work...

183
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,549
I'll have to take you with me.

184
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,189
You won't give up, will you?

185
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,223
Why should I?

186
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,452
Look at yourself!

187
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,788
Look at your state!

188
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:03,094
Any drunk can run over
a skating child!

189
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,962
That is exactly why
lam needed...

190
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,627
I need to protect my champs!

191
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,603
District championships are
just 2 months away.

192
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,230
I better be at it!

193
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,098
But for how long?

194
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:14,733
And is it worth it?

195
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,310
Every penny, big bro!

196
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,246
I'm doing it because
it's worth much more.

197
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,278
When I watch little children
ﬂy off on four wheels

198
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,684
and win trophies...

199
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,551
my world comes alive.

200
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,020
It's like giving them wings!

201
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,677
Hey!

202
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,245
Huh?

203
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,718
How much for these?

204
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,181
That thing on your feet.

205
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,091
Ohmthese?
-Ya... ya...

206
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,522
3O K.

207
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,629
Huh?

208
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,290
30 K!

209
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,332
Thirty?
- Yeah.

210
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,560
Thirty right?

211
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,565
That's exactly what I told him

212
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,434
and he says it's
a hundred thousand!

213
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,336
Told you! It's cheap!

214
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,703
Just thirty bucks!

215
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,499
Tell me... if you wanna do it,

216
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:21,976
I'll get it for you!

217
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,325
Keep it going. Three more laps.
Keep it going.

218
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,431
Smith bend your back.

219
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,125
Close to the cones.
Close to the cones guys.

220
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,464
Riyansh, your wheel is making
a lot of noise.

221
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:50,767
Oh my God...

222
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,702
This is really bad...

223
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,035
Sorry... Do I know you?

224
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,372
No...

225
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,079
I'm Pmgya Nanda.

226
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,409
You banged against
my brother Vinit's car...

227
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,153
I was out of the country.
I wasn't here.

228
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,483
You weren't here...

229
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,147
you were out of the country...

230
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,249
and you walk in
and make it sound like an accident.

231
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,384
Wow!

232
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,683
Why?

233
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,285
Was it not an accident?

234
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,627
Of course! Just like that,
accidentally...

235
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,429
dead drunk, he would have
mowed down my children...

236
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,234
He would have killed
Shivam had I not...

237
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,265
Forget it.

238
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,209
Your panel of lawyers
have been calling me.

239
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,381
They've been offering me
a lot of money...

240
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,247
What's your offer?

241
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,120
And what do I tell the cops?

242
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,286
That it was a bathroom accident?

243
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,257
Nothing to do with your brother...

244
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,058
so that he gets away scot free...

245
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,996
Party time again for him?

246
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,595
But my parents...
told me something else...

247
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:57,435
They said... you suddenly-

248
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,565
-jumped in front of the car.

249
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,041
I know that version.

250
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,339
I'm really sorry...

251
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:06,541
It's just...

252
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,052
he's my little brother...

253
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,583
I thought genuinely that
he deserved a second chance...

254
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,789
If I knew...l would've never...

255
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,559
Hey listen...

256
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,452
Bro...

257
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,550
Let's go by the police station.

258
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,059
Why?

259
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,586
You want to take
the cop out for dinner?

260
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,157
No... no...
I was thinking about that boy...

261
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,592
That boy or...

262
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,035
that girl?

263
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,733
Please Bro...

264
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,641
Thinking about the girl!

265
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,305
Hey! Take the left! Take the left!

266
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,212
Kherwadi police station is this way.

267
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,522
Yes?
- Mr. Aniket Bhargava?

268
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,455
Yes... That's me...

269
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,419
Sir...

270
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,060
lam... I...

271
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,394
Thank you...

272
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,069
I mean...

273
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,594
You did it just like that?

274
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,399
I went home and slapped
him so many times..

275
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,810
and you saved him...
just like that?

276
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:42,804
Wow.

277
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,137
So you're Vineet.

278
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,045
Sorry, I didn't recognize you...

279
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,277
That day there were
no proper introductions.

280
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,615
I lost my consciousness
afterjumping on your BMW,

281
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,710
hadn't I?

282
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,344
Sir-
- Come on in VineeL.

283
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,685
Come Pmgya... Come.

284
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,822
Sir l...made a mistake...

285
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,119
From today...

286
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,989
I never will drink again...
I promise...

287
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,124
<i>Never.</i>

288
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,335
That's good...
but do it for yourself...

289
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,166
and for those walking
on the streets.

290
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,762
Don't do me that favour.

291
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,467
What's this?

292
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,739
Heavy stuff.

293
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,111
Gold bars or what?

294
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,278
No. Those are books.

295
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,778
About heroes.

296
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,180
Nowadays... it's very difﬁcult
to ﬁnd heroes among men.

297
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,348
This is okay...

298
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,384
what about 'that?'

299
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,654
'That?'

300
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,324
I take cash...

301
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,792
once the job is over.

302
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,467
Take what you want.

303
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,697
Impressed.

304
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,072
What do you do?

305
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,402
Theatre.

306
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,304
Theatre? Come on...

307
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,037
Show us something...

308
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,375
Come on. Come show us.

309
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,546
Come.

310
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:54,582
No...

311
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,224
Uncle!

312
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,163
What?

313
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,293
Where's Gochi?

314
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,098
Why?

315
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,695
His Pa just died!
His Ma sent me to fetch him!

316
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,138
Hey Gochi!

317
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,583
Your pal's killing your
old man unnecessarily!

318
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,683
Go...

319
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,620
But be back in an hour!

320
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,782
Uncle...
- What is it?

321
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,719
Give me thirty bucks...
- Why?

322
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,351
Why are you asking why?

323
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,020
Cut it from my paycheck later.

324
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,323
Just hand it over.

325
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,230
I'll be back in an hour...

326
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,037
I'll cut 4 bucks an hour.

327
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,338
From 15?

328
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,743
Want me to cut it all?

329
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,508
I'll work all night...

330
00:33:58,636 --> 00:33:59,774
That you'll have to do anyway!

331
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,176
...have to cut 4 bucks.

332
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,219
Hey Murugan! Come!

333
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,619
Come down fast.

334
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,255
Let me go“

335
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,356
Go!

336
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,234
Who'll serve the tea?

337
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,501
Who'll wash the glasses?

338
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,703
His mom's dying
and you're bothered about tea duty?

339
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,210
Are you even human?

340
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,178
Shut up! Or I'll slap you!

341
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,608
Go for an hour.

342
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,210
Come back quickly.

343
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,637
Where's the boss?

344
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,605
No begging here. Get out!

345
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,576
Want nothing for free.

346
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,976
We've come to buy...

347
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:04,704
What's that?

348
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,039
Skate.

349
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,542
That one.

350
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,611
Hey!

351
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,120
Get out of my shop! Out!

352
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,749
We don't take anyone's nonsense.

353
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,585
Take this... and pack that.

354
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,236
What's the deal?

355
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,700
Want to make our friend a champion.

356
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,330
We checked one like that...

357
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,669
The kid said it cost thirty.

358
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,040
So got thirty!
Now start packing!

359
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,459
Twenty ﬁve...

360
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,192
Cool! We saved 5 bucks!

361
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,064
Zero...

362
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,696
zero...

363
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,099
zero...

364
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,499
How many zeroes?

365
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,702
Three zeroes...

366
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,544
How much is that Arjun?

367
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,614
Twenty ﬁve thousand...

368
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,411
So show us a cheaper one...

369
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,151
Pick up your pennies..

370
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,450
..and get lost!

371
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,729
Welcome ma'am...

372
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,698
Do you have swimming caps, goggles?

373
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,704
Sure.

374
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,741
They have F-50 also.

375
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,669
I swear... she had said thirty...

376
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:46,408
<i>Do you have them "m Speedos?
- Speeds is there, Scuba is there,</i>

377
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,744
Endurance is there.

378
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,484
Madam I have Nike also.

379
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,042
I want trunks also.

380
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,143
Sure.

381
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,087
Hey Gochi.

382
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,354
Gochi!

383
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,062
What are you doing here?

384
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,529
I thought all day...

385
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,199
What a head bang!

386
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,530
I want to take a good look at that.

387
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,230
What?

388
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,368
That...

389
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,504
Get that guy's.

390
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,467
NO! No!

391
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,548
I can't pick up what is not mine...

392
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,344
It's just for a bit.

393
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,017
I'm not taking it home.

394
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,076
No, his driver gets furious!

395
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,594
I've got an idea.

396
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,263
It's tea-time for this wise guy...

397
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,702
Tea.

398
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,273
Strong... creamy... doubly sugared.

399
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,373
Late r.

400
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,470
It'll get cold. No fun then!

401
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,572
Give them to me...
you have your tea.

402
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,139
Who are you?

403
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,207
I'm Gochi... his friend.

404
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,580
Relax, I'm holding it tight...

405
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,748
Riyansh!
Cross your legs at the turning.

406
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,423
Stick to the cones.

407
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,195
Don't bang into each other.
Don't bang. Keep distance.

408
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:50,663
Here...

409
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,268
Tea was good... Give it back.

410
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:58,541
Hey brother!

411
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,308
How did this happen?

412
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,049
It's very simple.

413
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,051
Spat on the bearing
and the dirt slid off...

414
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:06,951
What's your name again?

415
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,081
Gochi.

416
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,486
Do you go to school?

417
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,093
If I did, I'd end up feeding
books to my old man!

418
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,054
Come on champs! Get ready for races.

419
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,464
I'm timing you now.

420
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:21,663
I've understood.

421
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,663
It's about wheel balance.

422
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,232
Bhum, Bindaas, Abdul, you and I-

423
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,299
let's hit the
sump-yard on Sunday!

424
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,341
Hey Arjun. What are thinking?

425
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,064
Little drops of water,

426
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,158
ﬁll up the ocean.

427
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:57,162
Little grains of sand, the earth.

428
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,740
Moment by moment,

429
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,010
time collects to form age.

430
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,443
You dare not call
the moment small,

431
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,409
for it's the creator of all.

432
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,501
Where is he?!

433
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,602
Here he comes.

434
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,607
Can't you ever come on time?!

435
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,149
We've been waiting for so long...

436
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,312
My old man bashed me up so badly
early in the morningm.

437
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,822
Your old man also
doesn't wear a shirt does he?

438
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,423
As if your old man wears
a gold threaded jacket!

439
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,824
Why are you wrapping my dead old man

440
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,459
in a gold threaded jacket?

441
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,493
Why do you always say
'old man, old man'?

442
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,596
Can't you say 'father'?

443
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,329
Why? Calling him 'father'
will change the fellow?

444
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,666
Hey Bindaas, check that out.

445
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,410
Bro... What are you doing?

446
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:25,606
Its tickling!

447
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,207
Its a good sign.

448
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,184
I feel awkward...

449
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,775
You, at my feet...

450
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,480
I can't get over it..

451
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,481
Don't do this to me...

452
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,324
Come with me...

453
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,458
Time and again,
you plead and say..

454
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,362
'Don't do this to me.'

455
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,229
Cut the jokes Lucky. Get serious.

456
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,192
Try and understand.

457
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,134
Its been four years...

458
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,465
Some times its
the Russian coaches...

459
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,336
...some times a skating camp
in Pune!

460
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,768
Other times championships
or applications!

461
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,609
Don't I mean anything to you?

462
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,676
This street sport of yours...

463
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,382
...has trashed all my dreams.

464
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:13,584
You know...

465
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,427
back home hangs a big
photograph of Mom and Dad...

466
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,467
Everyday I look at them...

467
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,139
and...

468
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,403
I feel so guilty...

469
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,657
Come on little one... go for it.

470
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,157
Take a small turn...
ready steady go.

471
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,308
Swing... no half hands.

472
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,567
Well... its not simple.

473
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,373
The shops sell them for 30!

474
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:38,606
30 grand!

475
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,615
Some are for a hundred thousand!

476
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,684
But I'm sure we can make it!

477
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,581
Sure! Why not?!

478
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:56,755
All 4 wheels in a line...
not like a car.

479
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,432
And smooth... and balanced!

480
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,364
I've seen those.

481
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,663
Where?!

482
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,070
Where could you have seen?

483
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,403
It was ﬁrst time even for me.

484
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,464
Seen them he says!

485
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:10,444
You're the master mechanic...

486
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,003
I'm just your servant...

487
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,377
Your student!

488
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,345
20 cars to attend to...

489
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,442
and I'm stuck with your toy!

490
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,249
Shall we proceed...
with your permission?

491
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,289
So when did I say no?

492
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:24,019
All 4 wheels need support
strips on both sides,

493
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,219
welded here.

494
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,420
Got it Shekhar?

495
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,154
Yes boss!

496
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,729
What Uncle?!

497
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:22,739
This is not scrap. It's treasure!

498
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,044
Where are you staying?

499
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,617
My brother stays there,
I'm going for a holiday.

500
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,551
Thank you.

501
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,461
What? Why are you staring?

502
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,299
I told you I'd do it, didn't I?

503
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:53,099
May I wear it?

504
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,607
Wear a shirt ﬁrst!

505
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,103
May I wear it!

506
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,373
I'll wear them ﬁrst.

507
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,082
But I got all the stuff.

508
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,240
The gold threaded covers look good!

509
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,610
You can try them one by one.

510
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,456
I made them for you!
And you don't want to try?

511
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,423
I'll try them after all of you.

512
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,986
Flying Wheels is ready, kids!

513
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,562
But where will she ﬂy?

514
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,533
Hundreds of potholes here...

515
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,265
Where and how will she ﬂy?

516
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,665
Bandm Kurla.

517
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,161
Good.

518
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,433
But tomorrow.

519
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,135
It's late now,

520
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,407
get some rest.

521
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,500
Sq?

522
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,576
We've all got work tomorrow.

523
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,343
A man's got to work in the day,
not play Flying Wheels.

524
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,452
Nice name... Flying Wheels!

525
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,327
It's very simple.

526
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,103
I saw it the other day.

527
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,331
Nothing to it.

528
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,336
Walk like you walk,

529
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,103
the wheels do the rest!

530
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,476
Hey! What's so funny?

531
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,140
It happens the first time!

532
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,180
Murugan, give me a hand...

533
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,419
Hey... Don't leave my hand...

534
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,583
Don't leave...

535
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,556
How will you learn
if I keep holding you?

536
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:19,753
No no no....

537
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,292
Why are you laughing?

538
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:31,430
When your soft buns hit
the hard road,

539
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:34,237
I'd like to see your faces.

540
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,693
Hey brother, enough!

541
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:55,786
Enough!

542
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:56,656
Enough!

543
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,790
Enough.

544
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,393
What happened?

545
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:34,661
Nothing.

546
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,296
Can I stand and eat today?

547
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,567
Stand and eat?

548
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,301
You mean... graze like a cow?

549
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,816
Look... look.

550
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,073
Don't look down. Look at your turn.

551
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,538
Deep cross steps.

552
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,325
No, keep it.

553
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,732
Mr. Aniket Bhargava?
- Yes.

554
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,510
Your U. S. Visa.

555
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,335
It's come.

556
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,606
Powerful hands. Let them ﬂow.

557
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,707
Nice. Nice Ankita.

558
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,381
As you increase your speed
I want you to lean more forward.

559
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,075
Saw?

560
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:06,515
It's very simple.

561
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,218
Wow Arjun! You've tmnsformed.

562
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,226
Into what?
- Superman!

563
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,055
No, no.

564
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,391
I can barely do it.

565
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,489
You've come this far,
just by watching

566
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:20,000
when Mr. Double Sugared Tea
trains you...

567
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,366
you'll become a champion!

568
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,261
Pray and come tomorrow.

569
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,136
We'll set you up with him.

570
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,197
Get up now...

571
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,151
Bro, what are you doing?

572
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,151
It's time for class.

573
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,278
Hurry "P!

574
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:40,685
And why are you packing my shirts?

575
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:41,745
I'll wear yours...

576
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,286
It's for just a month!

577
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,653
Who knows? Once there,
you might change your mind.

578
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:53,232
Hello

579
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,238
Speak out winding ways...
twisted trunks...

580
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,638
speak out! Why so quiet!

581
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,973
Shout out Mother Goddess, shout out!

582
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,538
Excuse me?

583
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,244
Madhu Rye's Ashwatthama

584
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,141
It's opening on Sunday.

585
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,513
How many seats shall I keep?

586
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,018
Oops! Actually...

587
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,554
I'm leaving for
New York tonight.

588
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,754
But if you say so,

589
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,548
should I postpone it?

590
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,553
Hello?

591
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,564
Abandoning your country,
you traitor?

592
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:25,599
No no...

593
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,134
just going for a short while...

594
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,335
Only for bmhmaand (universe)...

595
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,636
You mean, for a bhmman (journey),
don't you?

596
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,731
Same difference.

597
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,772
No! Bmhmaand means universe.

598
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,275
That's a long journey.

599
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,179
If I get back, I'll call you.

600
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,618
What? Shall we go?

601
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,515
But what if you turn into
an American bug?

602
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,361
If I wanted to turn into an
American bug...

603
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:00,433
I would have followed
this great one long ago.

604
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,630
I wouldn't have stayed on.

605
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,732
Champs, it's just a matter
of one month.

606
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,600
Come on now... Come on!

607
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,541
Okay. I'll tell you what...

608
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,139
I want all of you
to give me your best today,

609
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:17,516
so I can leave relaxed

610
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:21,750
So champs.
North, South, East, West...

611
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,150
Roll-o-ﬁt is the best!

612
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,990
That's the spirit. Okay then...

613
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,621
Go... go!

614
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,071
Oh Lord, of curved trunk,
massive body,

615
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,268
and with the splendor
of a million suns,

616
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,736
please bless me so that

617
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,776
I do not face any obstacles,
in any of my endeavors.

618
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,778
I don't know how
to pray but still...

619
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,084
I'm trying for the ﬁrst time...

620
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,255
There's always a ﬁrst time...

621
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:58,254
In the name of the Lord.

622
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,269
Keep your eyes on the turn.

623
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:00,946
Raju?!

624
00:59:36,238 --> 00:59:37,808
Then the tribal boy Eklavya,

625
00:59:37,873 --> 00:59:40,149
made a statue of
Dronacharya in the jungle.

626
00:59:41,243 --> 00:59:45,783
So what if the great teacher
Dronacharya refused to train him?

627
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:47,953
The boy didn't accept defeat.

628
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:52,197
He practiced archery,

629
00:59:52,654 --> 00:59:56,295
drawing inspiration
from the statue of his teacher.

630
00:59:57,092 --> 01:00:00,073
Relentless practice resulted

631
01:00:00,729 --> 01:00:03,938
in Eklavya transforming into
the best archer of that land.

632
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:08,179
You are just like Eklavya, Raju.

633
01:00:10,772 --> 01:00:13,013
<i>Who's Raw here?</i>

634
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:16,718
Why? Isn't he Raju?

635
01:00:16,778 --> 01:00:19,850
That's Arjun! Our Eklava.

636
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:21,622
And his Flying Wheels.

637
01:00:21,817 --> 01:00:23,160
Flying Wheels?

638
01:00:23,885 --> 01:00:25,558
My friends created her.

639
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:28,625
Fabulous guys!

640
01:00:29,891 --> 01:00:31,063
Arjun,

641
01:00:31,126 --> 01:00:32,332
you want to learn skating?

642
01:00:32,594 --> 01:00:34,631
I'll teach you. Starting tomorrow.

643
01:00:35,964 --> 01:00:38,069
In the evening...at 7. Here.

644
01:00:39,301 --> 01:00:41,338
At 7 my boss won't leave me...

645
01:00:41,603 --> 01:00:43,640
Then you leave him.
How much does he pay?

646
01:00:43,705 --> 01:00:45,048
I'll give it to you.

647
01:00:45,107 --> 01:00:48,145
Boss pays me for work.

648
01:00:49,111 --> 01:00:50,681
I don't accept charity.

649
01:00:55,951 --> 01:00:57,589
Okay. I'll wait.

650
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,897
Will it be okay
if I teach after class?

651
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,934
Sir, you won't be needing
that now, would you?

652
01:01:11,366 --> 01:01:13,004
I can give you 200 bucks for it.

653
01:01:13,935 --> 01:01:16,677
You keep it. I'll give you 200!

654
01:01:16,805 --> 01:01:18,614
I'm fed up of'sitting on it!

655
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:44,778
<i>Faster bro, faster‘.!</i>

656
01:02:23,705 --> 01:02:25,548
What a creation!

657
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:28,578
Grips the road so tightly.

658
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:30,289
Oh, that's just mechanical stuff.

659
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:33,950
But, Bindaas,
what scrap you sourced!

660
01:02:34,015 --> 01:02:36,017
Scrap is scrap...

661
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:40,157
It's Abdul's gold threads
that give it the show.

662
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:42,259
Look how they shine!

663
01:02:44,025 --> 01:02:46,266
Nothing more than mere
blouse sleeves.

664
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:48,934
But you sat up nights and made them.

665
01:02:53,668 --> 01:02:55,204
I didn't do a thing...

666
01:02:56,204 --> 01:02:58,912
and yet I'm gorging on this feast.

667
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:00,845
Look at this idiot...

668
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:02,014
It is yourjasmine garlands...

669
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:03,579
that have made her divine.

670
01:03:10,285 --> 01:03:12,765
Aunty, the food is excellent.

671
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,168
Did you call for the taxi?

672
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:25,839
Should I call?

673
01:03:28,103 --> 01:03:30,105
How many times do you
want me to say sorry?

674
01:03:30,672 --> 01:03:31,309
I tell you what...

675
01:03:31,573 --> 01:03:32,916
I'll come over for Christmas.
Promise!

676
01:03:32,974 --> 01:03:34,954
It's not about that.
- Then?

677
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,250
This is sheer madness!

678
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:37,585
Ridiculous it is!

679
01:03:38,146 --> 01:03:39,682
Barely 2 months to the district
championships

680
01:03:39,714 --> 01:03:41,853
and you say that you'll make
that tin soldier a champion.

681
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:24,230
Just look at this! Look.

682
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:26,969
Our childhood memories
are hidden in them.

683
01:04:27,095 --> 01:04:28,233
This is my life!

684
01:04:28,296 --> 01:04:30,867
It was yours too!
You moved on... I can't!

685
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:34,077
That boy is a champion!

686
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,611
Just imagine... ﬁve little kids...

687
01:04:36,671 --> 01:04:39,151
put together a working pair
of inline skates out of scrap.

688
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:41,278
I feel so motivated!

689
01:04:41,977 --> 01:04:43,923
Just watch... I'll make him a champ!

690
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,558
You just wait and watch...

691
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:46,820
I'll make him a champion!

692
01:04:47,616 --> 01:04:48,788
I'm seeing...

693
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:51,891
I'm Seeing that you haven't
stopped living in your dreams...

694
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:10,176
Yes.

695
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,645
Ladies and gentlemen,

696
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:20,158
welcome to JFK International
Airport, New York City.

697
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:23,087
You didn't speak to me
even at the airport...

698
01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:25,623
I know you are angry...

699
01:05:25,687 --> 01:05:26,893
but please,

700
01:05:27,122 --> 01:05:28,658
don't cut me off like that...

701
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:49,815
Ready?

702
01:05:53,014 --> 01:05:54,687
Hey...what are you doing?

703
01:05:56,584 --> 01:05:57,654
Come.

704
01:06:02,824 --> 01:06:06,670
Knees, back, neck, head... all bent.

705
01:06:06,895 --> 01:06:08,306
Ready for attack.

706
01:06:08,663 --> 01:06:10,233
Go! Hit your legs.

707
01:06:10,298 --> 01:06:11,299
Ankles straight.

708
01:06:11,566 --> 01:06:13,739
Entire body weight
on the centre of the wheels...

709
01:06:14,636 --> 01:06:16,513
Arjun you're not skating!

710
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,846
Arjun...
- Bend!

711
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,581
Do it properly! Come on!

712
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:30,791
Hands behind, Arjun!
And knees lower.

713
01:06:32,787 --> 01:06:37,702
Hit the tar, Arjun!
Don't slow down at the bend.

714
01:06:40,295 --> 01:06:41,968
Haven't eaten or what?

715
01:06:58,947 --> 01:07:01,291
Come on! On the spot jogging.
5 minutes.

716
01:07:01,549 --> 01:07:02,721
Start.

717
01:07:06,821 --> 01:07:08,198
Look straight!

718
01:07:17,699 --> 01:07:19,872
Hey Gochi! Be careful.

719
01:07:35,183 --> 01:07:37,094
Move your arms. Move your arms.

720
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,826
Nice.

721
01:07:41,256 --> 01:07:42,667
Bend down.

722
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:10,889
Arjun!

723
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:29,571
Asleep already?

724
01:08:30,071 --> 01:08:31,778
Even last night you skipped dinner.

725
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,542
Arjun, get up son...

726
01:08:50,959 --> 01:08:52,905
Maintain your balance.

727
01:09:02,237 --> 01:09:03,682
Take your stance.

728
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:05,146
Go!

729
01:09:10,879 --> 01:09:13,120
Double up! Double up!
Come on Arjun!

730
01:09:20,955 --> 01:09:22,127
What them?

731
01:09:23,992 --> 01:09:25,232
What is this timing, Arjun?

732
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:27,834
What is this timing?

733
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:30,605
At this rate you won't even qualify.

734
01:09:32,934 --> 01:09:34,345
Look, you want to be a champion?

735
01:09:34,602 --> 01:09:35,603
Then give it your all.

736
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,274
Otherwise don't waste
your time and mine.

737
01:09:37,705 --> 01:09:39,946
The doctor hasn't prescribed
skating to you Arjun.

738
01:11:10,298 --> 01:11:11,675
Francis!

739
01:11:11,866 --> 01:11:12,936
Rutvi!

740
01:11:13,134 --> 01:11:13,976
Riyansh!

741
01:11:14,035 --> 01:11:14,945

743
01:11:17,305 --> 01:11:18,909
Wait after class.

744
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,585
Extra p ractice .

745
01:11:46,134 --> 01:11:47,135
Listen up now.

746
01:11:47,302 --> 01:11:48,303
Start!

747
01:11:48,903 --> 01:11:50,075
A good start means...

748
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:51,173
...you win the race.

749
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:52,309
Arjun...

750
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,146
Come forward.

751
01:11:54,275 --> 01:11:55,652
Bend.

752
01:11:57,011 --> 01:11:58,991
All your body weight on this.

753
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,625
Look straight.

754
01:12:01,582 --> 01:12:02,754
Go!

755
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,143
The difference between
victory and defeat.

756
01:12:21,736 --> 01:12:23,238
Four steps in one.

757
01:12:23,771 --> 01:12:25,182
The game changer...

758
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,644
Split!

759
01:12:29,911 --> 01:12:32,255
Waghmare! Look at his legs...

760
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:51,872
Champ sir! Champ!!

761
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:53,277
kn.
t he?

762
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:54,711
He skates as if he can see

763
01:12:54,736 --> 01:12:56,716
..the ﬁnish line right
in front of his eyes.

764
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:02,585
Slow down champs. Take it easy.

765
01:13:08,249 --> 01:13:09,694
Wow!

766
01:13:11,853 --> 01:13:15,164
Sir...my speed bearings
and mcing wheels.

767
01:13:15,223 --> 01:13:18,067
These will double his speed.

768
01:13:18,726 --> 01:13:20,603
That's so sweet Burger Badshah...

769
01:13:20,762 --> 01:13:23,265
but don't worry,
I've already got him new ones.

770
01:13:24,232 --> 01:13:27,213
Sir...but if he skates
on my wheels...

771
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:29,578
I'll feel very proud.

772
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,177
You rock Burger Badshah!

773
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:43,259
Here. For the champion.

774
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:47,657
May the Lord help you
and take you closer to victory.

775
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:50,202
Arjun who can stop your victory?

776
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:52,630
Lucky Sir...

777
01:14:53,054 --> 01:14:58,026
Which category will
your Flying Wheels skate in?

778
01:14:58,826 --> 01:15:00,237
Don't worry Mrs. Malhotm.

779
01:15:00,294 --> 01:15:02,205
He is not in your son's category.

780
01:15:11,739 --> 01:15:12,911
Madam?

781
01:15:13,574 --> 01:15:15,679
Can I come late to work tomorrow?

782
01:15:15,843 --> 01:15:17,151
Why? What happened?

783
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:19,691
It's my Arjun's skating race.

784
01:15:19,914 --> 01:15:21,951
Your son skates?

785
01:15:23,017 --> 01:15:24,826
District level.
- Wow!

786
01:15:27,588 --> 01:15:28,862
Hey Bro...

787
01:15:29,023 --> 01:15:30,866
The district championship
is tomorrow

788
01:15:31,025 --> 01:15:32,231

789
01:15:32,293 --> 01:15:35,638
My Arjun Harishchandm
Waghmare is ready.

790
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:37,537
You remember, in our time?

791
01:15:37,598 --> 01:15:38,906
There was a boy from Jalgaon...

792
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:40,805
<i>P rateek Pat“ .</i>

793
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:44,011
No proper skates. No coach. Nothing.

794
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:48,612
He would walk in
and claim the 5km gold...

795
01:15:48,676 --> 01:15:49,677
...year after year.

796
01:15:49,744 --> 01:15:51,223
Sheer grit and spirit.

797
01:15:52,313 --> 01:15:57,160
My Arjun...he is cut
from the same cloth.

798
01:16:03,124 --> 01:16:04,330

lsaid 'Hi..'

806
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:39,737
Oh! Hi Pmgya...

807
01:16:39,794 --> 01:16:41,569
What's the matter? Something wrong?

808
01:16:41,629 --> 01:16:43,302
One of my boys hasn't turned up.

809
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:45,608
So call him.

810
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:47,577
No Pmgya. He doesn't have a phone.

811
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:49,245
I don't know what to do.

812
01:16:49,971 --> 01:16:52,281
Sir! 12 - 14 age group...

813
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:54,178
Flying Wheels is not here.

814
01:16:54,542 --> 01:16:55,680
Pmgya I'll see you...

815
01:17:35,516 --> 01:17:37,018
Bhatt where's Arjun vanished?

816
01:17:37,084 --> 01:17:38,290
Wasn't his race today?

817
01:17:38,552 --> 01:17:40,657
He didn't show up.
Don't know where he's disappeared...

818
01:17:42,023 --> 01:17:43,593
He mustn't not have found
the address..

819
01:17:43,658 --> 01:17:44,728
he must be wandering
looking for the place...

820
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:46,738
No no...
I had explained it to him.

821
01:17:46,794 --> 01:17:48,535
His mother was supposed
to come with him.

822
01:17:48,596 --> 01:17:49,700
He hasn't come here.

823
01:17:49,764 --> 01:17:50,902
Then where has he gone Bhatt?!

824
01:17:50,965 --> 01:17:53,707
I don't know, Sir.
These kids come in for 3-4 months...

825
01:17:53,768 --> 01:17:55,270
then they ﬁnd better pay
and leave...

826
01:17:55,302 --> 01:17:56,679
But how can he leave like that?

827
01:17:56,737 --> 01:17:57,909
It was his District Championship!

828
01:17:57,972 --> 01:17:59,315
He can't disappear like that!

829
01:17:59,573 --> 01:18:00,574
It's ridiculous!

830
01:18:00,641 --> 01:18:01,711
What?

831
01:18:02,209 --> 01:18:04,052
Nothing... Do me a favour.
Take my number,

832
01:18:04,111 --> 01:18:05,818
and call me as soon as he comes...
- Yes Sir...

833
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,917
Don't nod, write it down!
- Yes Sir

834
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:09,590
9920...

835
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:10,788
9920...

836
01:18:10,851 --> 01:18:12,159
981970!

837
01:18:12,553 --> 01:18:14,726
9?
- 981970!

838
01:18:15,589 --> 01:18:17,159
Do you know where he lives?

839
01:18:17,224 --> 01:18:18,862
Not really.

840
01:18:18,993 --> 01:18:20,631
Somewhere in Dharavi slums...

841
01:18:20,761 --> 01:18:23,799
his aunt has a shanty near
the potters' quarters...

842
01:19:04,939 --> 01:19:05,883
Yes Bhatt...

843
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,045
Sir his friend is here
to collect his dues.

844
01:19:08,109 --> 01:19:09,247
Who is it? Let me speak to him...

845
01:19:10,277 --> 01:19:12,086
Yeah?
- Who is this?

846
01:19:12,313 --> 01:19:14,793
Sir. Gochi. Arjun's friend.

847
01:19:14,815 --> 01:19:17,819
Where is he?!
- In the hospital.

848
01:19:17,885 --> 01:19:19,694
What?! Which hospital?

849
01:19:19,754 --> 01:19:21,028
Bandra General.

850
01:19:28,129 --> 01:19:29,608
Sir! Sir! Sir!

851
01:19:29,663 --> 01:19:30,835
Not there.

852
01:19:30,898 --> 01:19:32,844
Here... on the ﬂoor.

853
01:19:33,868 --> 01:19:34,903
Arjun.

854
01:19:34,969 --> 01:19:36,846
What happened to him?!

855
01:19:37,638 --> 01:19:40,676
He was blabbering deliriously
with high fever...

856
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,616
Now even that has stopped...

857
01:19:42,643 --> 01:19:44,953
When did you get him here?
- It's been a couple of hours...

858
01:19:45,012 --> 01:19:47,856
I dropped him off here
and rushed to collect his money.

859
01:19:47,915 --> 01:19:49,087
Has a doctor seen him?

860
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:52,029
The one who could've ﬁlled
the form has only passed out.

861
01:19:52,086 --> 01:19:54,032
Gochi go stop a cab!

862
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:55,359
Arjun..

863
01:20:00,828 --> 01:20:02,102
Arjun...

864
01:20:56,684 --> 01:20:57,856
You are the mother?

865
01:21:01,188 --> 01:21:02,690
What do you people do?

866
01:21:02,923 --> 01:21:05,096
How could
you let it come to this?

867
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,171
Severe hepatitis...

868
01:21:09,663 --> 01:21:11,074
He's got hepatitis.

869
01:21:11,599 --> 01:21:13,306
How many days since he's eaten?

870
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,619
What have I done?

871
01:21:22,142 --> 01:21:24,179
All day on his feet...

872
01:21:25,045 --> 01:21:28,151
coming late and passing out...

873
01:21:28,782 --> 01:21:30,159
refusing to wake up...

874
01:21:30,217 --> 01:21:32,595
I thought it must be fatigue.

875
01:21:32,786 --> 01:21:35,096
God!
These people just don't understand.

876
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:37,293
He's crushed with exhaustion!

877
01:21:38,592 --> 01:21:39,696
The child isn't eating...

878
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,966
He's passing out hungry...

879
01:21:40,995 --> 01:21:43,100
and you didn't think
he needed a doctor?

880
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:45,335
What were you waiting for?
Him passing out?!

881
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:50,011
This one mistake can
cost you his life.

882
01:21:52,139 --> 01:21:53,777
Why do you make him work?

883
01:21:54,141 --> 01:21:55,848
ls it the age to work?

884
01:21:58,846 --> 01:22:00,723
Doctor, please save him.

885
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:02,055
What do you think I am doing here?

886
01:22:02,182 --> 01:22:05,254
No, no... I mean...
please don't spare any costs.

887
01:22:16,664 --> 01:22:19,235
Granny will just light this lamp
and be with you.

888
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:22,147
Brother Arjun is very ill...

889
01:22:22,736 --> 01:22:25,615
I have to complain to the Almighty.

890
01:23:36,677 --> 01:23:37,655
Lucky...

891
01:23:37,711 --> 01:23:39,019
Here.

892
01:23:51,191 --> 01:23:53,603
Look at our champ.

893
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:56,337
Because of Sir, he's alive at least.

894
01:23:57,064 --> 01:23:59,738
Otherwise he would've kicked it.

895
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:03,678
There is no difference
between garbage and us.

896
01:24:04,204 --> 01:24:06,946
We come close,
and the window slides shut.

897
01:24:07,107 --> 01:24:10,680
Damn it! Clutch it like this...
push it down!

898
01:24:11,278 --> 01:24:14,657
Shout straight into the face!

899
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:16,150
'Look there!'

900
01:24:16,216 --> 01:24:18,753
'That's a gutsy fellow!'

901
01:24:18,919 --> 01:24:21,559
'The clay he gets a chance,
he'll wrench it!'

902
01:24:21,622 --> 01:24:23,568
'He'll beat you hollow!'

903
01:24:24,658 --> 01:24:27,195
He's our Eklava! You got it?!

904
01:24:40,174 --> 01:24:41,676
What did you say? 'Eklava'?

905
01:25:44,705 --> 01:25:46,685
He winked!

906
01:25:46,907 --> 01:25:49,649
Arjun open your eyes.
Wake up, Arjun!

907
01:25:49,843 --> 01:25:51,789
What happened?
- He opened his eyes aunty!

908
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:53,549
Arjun! Arjun!

909
01:25:53,614 --> 01:25:54,752
What's happening here?!

910
01:25:54,815 --> 01:25:59,286
I saw him wink!
- Out! Out! Come on!

911
01:26:00,854 --> 01:26:02,026
Out!

912
01:26:17,871 --> 01:26:20,715
What happened?
- No clue Sir.

913
01:26:20,941 --> 01:26:24,946
He's been crying since
he regained consciousness.

914
01:26:36,723 --> 01:26:39,203
Forgive me Sir...

915
01:26:40,827 --> 01:26:42,204
Wha... What happened?

916
01:26:42,262 --> 01:26:44,640
I lost Sir.

917
01:26:44,698 --> 01:26:46,678
Race is over...

918
01:26:49,603 --> 01:26:51,139
What are you saying child?

919
01:26:51,805 --> 01:26:53,807
I lost....

920
01:26:58,011 --> 01:27:00,321
Stop this nonsense...
Stop it I tell you!

921
01:27:01,782 --> 01:27:03,557
I lost, didn't I?

922
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,203
Grandly I set out to feed him cake
on a golden platter...

923
01:27:17,231 --> 01:27:20,041
slipped and fell face down
into the cake.

924
01:27:20,801 --> 01:27:23,645
Skating, skating, skating!

925
01:27:24,137 --> 01:27:25,980
Am I blind or what?

926
01:27:27,007 --> 01:27:29,647
My champ is sinking... and me?

927
01:27:31,712 --> 01:27:34,625
Who is this
Arjun Harishchandm Waghmare?

928
01:27:35,182 --> 01:27:36,923
Where does he live?

929
01:27:37,084 --> 01:27:38,188
What does he eat?

930
01:27:38,252 --> 01:27:39,629
Does he eat at all?

931
01:27:39,653 --> 01:27:40,927
I don't know.

932
01:27:41,722 --> 01:27:43,759
And yet, I'm teaching him skating...

933
01:27:43,924 --> 01:27:45,562
making him a champion.

934
01:27:47,094 --> 01:27:48,903
One more gold medal...

935
01:27:49,162 --> 01:27:51,836
one more feather in my cap.

936
01:27:53,767 --> 01:27:55,212
As for Arjun...

937
01:27:56,069 --> 01:28:00,245
With a medal dangling,
he'll be back to sewing tea.

938
01:28:01,074 --> 01:28:02,280
And I?

939
01:28:02,909 --> 01:28:04,547
<i>
'

</i> pay my taxes,

940
01:28:05,178 --> 01:28:06,316
stop at red,

941
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:07,957
move at green

942
01:28:09,049 --> 01:28:10,756
and feel very good.

943
01:28:11,318 --> 01:28:13,992
V9 FY, Very good.

944
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:48,629
What's on your mind Sir?

945
01:28:48,922 --> 01:28:50,526
Your plate is empty.

946
01:28:51,758 --> 01:28:53,169
Why so lost?

947
01:28:53,994 --> 01:28:55,098
Just thinking...

948
01:28:55,162 --> 01:28:56,664
So deePW?

949
01:29:01,268 --> 01:29:03,680
When you see children
going to school...

950
01:29:04,671 --> 01:29:07,982
parents picking them up,
dropping them...

951
01:29:08,742 --> 01:29:10,050
What do you think?

952
01:29:10,544 --> 01:29:12,615
A burden worthy of a pack-mule,

953
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:16,627
lunches double their capacity.

954
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:18,791
Poor guys are tapped.

955
01:29:19,152 --> 01:29:20,756
And you all are free?

956
01:29:21,054 --> 01:29:22,590
No meals...

957
01:29:22,989 --> 01:29:24,093
no school.

958
01:29:24,157 --> 01:29:25,830
We didn't ask for it.

959
01:29:25,959 --> 01:29:27,267
From where the Lord ﬂung us,

960
01:29:27,327 --> 01:29:28,965
we rose and marched on.

961
01:29:31,565 --> 01:29:33,943
And destination?
- Destination meaning?

962
01:29:34,835 --> 01:29:37,111
Who doesn't dream in this world?

963
01:29:37,304 --> 01:29:39,215
Doesn't want
to fulﬁll those dreams?

964
01:29:40,173 --> 01:29:42,312
Surely you've got dreams too.

965
01:29:42,809 --> 01:29:45,312
What strange dream
did you see last night...

966
01:29:45,645 --> 01:29:47,215
that has gotten you in this mood?

967
01:29:48,215 --> 01:29:49,592
Do you really want to know?

968
01:29:54,988 --> 01:29:56,296
lsee...

969
01:29:56,656 --> 01:29:58,329
that all of you are in school.

970
01:30:00,627 --> 01:30:03,767
Instead of red and gold threads,

971
01:30:04,197 --> 01:30:06,006
Abdul has a nice pen in his hands.

972
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:10,782
Instead of garbage,
Murugan is picking up a book.

973
01:30:12,773 --> 01:30:15,652
Gochi is painting on
a canvas with a colourful brush.

974
01:30:17,177 --> 01:30:18,815
Bhum is reciting a poem...

975
01:30:20,213 --> 01:30:22,716
And our Eklava- Arjun-

976
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:24,793
is marching back with the gold.

977
01:30:25,185 --> 01:30:27,256
One dream at a time...

978
01:30:27,587 --> 01:30:29,897
Let's fulﬁll that ﬁrst...
right Sir?

979
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,907
But that race is over.

980
01:30:44,805 --> 01:30:46,216
What about the dream?

981
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,042
We all dreamt it together.

982
01:30:52,078 --> 01:30:53,682
It's shattered, isn't it?

983
01:30:55,882 --> 01:30:58,362
It's not the kind that
shatters when you wake...

984
01:30:58,919 --> 01:31:00,990
Let our champion recover.

985
01:31:01,054 --> 01:31:02,294
Then we'll set him up right?

986
01:31:02,689 --> 01:31:03,997
Of course...

987
01:31:04,024 --> 01:31:05,196
But where?

988
01:31:05,258 --> 01:31:06,794
In the State Competition.

989
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,941
But Mumbai District competition...

990
01:31:09,996 --> 01:31:11,839
is over, right Sir?

991
01:31:14,267 --> 01:31:18,010
There are 35 districts in
Maharashtra...

992
01:31:18,672 --> 01:31:20,879
and on our champion Arjun
Harishchandm Waghmare's form,

993
01:31:20,941 --> 01:31:22,716
it shall be written...

994
01:31:22,909 --> 01:31:24,252
Kolzhari Village,

995
01:31:24,611 --> 01:31:26,750
Yavatmal district, Maharashtra...

996
01:31:27,747 --> 01:31:29,988
From where nobody has ever competed.

997
01:31:38,792 --> 01:31:40,897
I had set out to teach Eklavya...

998
01:31:41,695 --> 01:31:44,005
and I landed with 5 Pandavas!

999
01:31:45,866 --> 01:31:48,779
At ﬁrst I thought
I was changing their lives...

1000
01:31:50,237 --> 01:31:55,778
now I've understood that
they've changed me forever...

1001
01:31:57,043 --> 01:32:00,581
Such small children...
and such big hearts!

1002
01:32:02,215 --> 01:32:06,061
I've hit jackpot Brother.

1003
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:21,737
North-South-East-West-

1004
01:32:21,801 --> 01:32:24,543
Arjun Waghmare is the best!

1005
01:32:37,284 --> 01:32:38,888
Food for the entire ward?

1006
01:32:38,919 --> 01:32:40,193
No doctor...

1007
01:32:40,253 --> 01:32:41,891
the food's here.

1008
01:32:59,573 --> 01:33:01,814
There you go.
Special delivery!

1009
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:03,650
Wear it and scoot off.

1010
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:05,853
Wow!

1011
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:09,317
Ask Sir to tell the doctor...

1012
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:11,054
I want to begin.

1013
01:33:59,699 --> 01:34:01,042
He's ﬂying!

1014
01:34:05,005 --> 01:34:07,713
Strong, creamy, doubly sugared tea.

1015
01:34:07,941 --> 01:34:09,147
New here?

1016
01:34:09,209 --> 01:34:10,279
Yes.

1017
01:34:10,343 --> 01:34:11,253
What's your name?

1018
01:34:11,311 --> 01:34:12,346
Raju.

1019
01:34:14,114 --> 01:34:15,991
Bhatt you're too much!

1020
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,203
Bend down! Nice!

1021
01:34:27,794 --> 01:34:29,239
Shriya bend down!

1022
01:34:34,801 --> 01:34:36,144
Focus! Focus!

1023
01:35:00,627 --> 01:35:02,766
Why is the ﬁre brigade painted red?

1024
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:05,800
Pass.

1025
01:35:05,865 --> 01:35:08,641
Everybody pass?
- Pass.

1026
01:35:08,935 --> 01:35:11,575
Because it has 8 men and 4 wheels.

1027
01:35:11,638 --> 01:35:13,618
8 plus 4 is equal to 12,

1028
01:35:13,673 --> 01:35:15,050
12 makes a foot,

1029
01:35:15,108 --> 01:35:16,746
foot makes a ruler,

1030
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:19,086
ruler reminds us
of the king of England.

1031
01:35:19,245 --> 01:35:21,020
England is next to Finland,

1032
01:35:21,081 --> 01:35:23,288
the tip of Finland points to Russia,

1033
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:24,995
Russia's ﬂag is red.

1034
01:35:25,051 --> 01:35:27,554
That is why the ﬁre brigade
is painted red.

1035
01:35:29,022 --> 01:35:30,899
Sir! Look! Who has come!

1036
01:35:30,957 --> 01:35:32,698
The great American bug!

1037
01:35:32,759 --> 01:35:34,705
Sir! Look! Sir! Look!

1038
01:35:40,533 --> 01:35:42,638
I don't believe this... Bro!

1039
01:35:49,075 --> 01:35:50,315
Bro!

1040
01:35:52,112 --> 01:35:53,147
What a surprise!

1041
01:35:53,213 --> 01:35:55,250
I've taken leave and come.

1042
01:35:56,883 --> 01:35:58,726
I want to see your dream come true.

1043
01:35:59,886 --> 01:36:01,797
So... North-South-East-West-

1044
01:36:01,855 --> 01:36:03,664
Roll-o-ﬁt is the best!

1045
01:36:16,569 --> 01:36:19,175
Speed lovers, skating enthusiasts,

1046
01:36:19,239 --> 01:36:21,276
children, mummies and daddies-

1047
01:36:21,541 --> 01:36:24,886
put your hands together
to welcome Shri Rajeev Patil,

1048
01:36:24,944 --> 01:36:28,084
who will light the ceremonial lamp
to ritually open

1049
01:36:28,148 --> 01:36:31,254
the 24th Maharashtra
Speed Skating Championship.

1050
01:36:33,052 --> 01:36:37,159
Skating is a new sport and every
sport has a swashbuckling hero.

1051
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:40,067
I want to hear deafening applause

1052
01:36:40,126 --> 01:36:42,663
to welcome Mr. Nikhilesh Tabhane-

1053
01:36:42,729 --> 01:36:45,209
the fastest man on wheels in India.

1054
01:36:45,698 --> 01:36:47,075
Nikhilesh Tabhane.

1055
01:36:49,869 --> 01:36:54,045
I declare the 24th Maharashtra
Speed Skating Championship open.

1056
01:36:54,574 --> 01:36:57,020
Welcome. A very good afternoon
Ladies and Gentlemen!

1057
01:36:57,076 --> 01:36:58,680
The first race for today,

1058
01:36:58,711 --> 01:37:00,713
girls age group 12 - 14.

1059
01:37:02,248 --> 01:37:04,660
And here we go!
What a way to start off!

1060
01:37:04,717 --> 01:37:06,321
Shreya at her best.

1061
01:37:06,586 --> 01:37:07,929
Leading as always.

1062
01:37:07,987 --> 01:37:09,967
She is a three time state champion.

1063
01:37:10,023 --> 01:37:11,866
Let's see if she does it again here.

1064
01:37:12,058 --> 01:37:14,197
Look at them go,
they are on the ﬁrst bang.

1065
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:15,762
She is maintaining the lead.

1066
01:37:24,037 --> 01:37:26,074
Boys! Age group 12 - 14...

1067
01:37:26,139 --> 01:37:28,016
please move to the starting line...

1068
01:37:28,575 --> 01:37:30,521
All birth certiﬁcates to Mr. Rathod

1069
01:37:30,577 --> 01:37:32,250
at the records-desk
for veriﬁcation.

1070
01:37:32,512 --> 01:37:34,116
Arjun Harishchandm Waghmare...

1071
01:37:34,747 --> 01:37:38,251
When your little bells will land
on the skating track...

1072
01:37:38,518 --> 01:37:40,691
they'll blast people's ears off!

1073
01:37:41,855 --> 01:37:43,232
All the best!

1074
01:37:44,824 --> 01:37:46,064
Eklava.

1075
01:37:46,926 --> 01:37:50,772
Last and ﬁnal call for
Boys age group 12 - 14...

1076
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:52,832
please move to the starting line.

1077
01:37:56,169 --> 01:37:58,274
In the boys 12 - 14 age group,

01:37:58,538 --> 01:38:01,815
on the outer most track,
we have Jaival Shah from Mumbai!

And for the first time in

01:38:36,943 --> 01:38:39,753
an entry from Yavatmal district-

1087
01:38:39,812 --> 01:38:42,656
Arjun Harishchandm Waghmare!

1088
01:38:52,659 --> 01:38:55,833
So that's the lineup for the boys
12 - 14 age group.

1089
01:38:55,862 --> 01:38:57,899
It's a ﬁercely competitive category

1090
01:38:57,964 --> 01:39:00,638
and this is going to be
one exciting race.

1091
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:03,237
The skaters are all warmed up
and they are on the track.

1092
01:39:03,303 --> 01:39:06,045
The ofﬁcials are ready
and we are set to go!

1093
01:39:07,006 --> 01:39:09,145
Skaters! On your marks!

1094
01:39:14,247 --> 01:39:15,624
Get set...

1095
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:25,892
Don't fire the shot! Stop the race!

1096
01:39:28,561 --> 01:39:29,767
Lucky Bhargava!

1097
01:39:30,897 --> 01:39:32,103
Lucky Bhargava... Come here!

1098
01:39:32,165 --> 01:39:33,576
Come here. There's a problem.

1099
01:39:41,808 --> 01:39:43,082
What have you submitted Lucky...

1100
01:39:43,142 --> 01:39:45,315
Your single entry from Yavatmal?

1101
01:39:46,646 --> 01:39:48,182
Where is his birth certiﬁcate?

1102
01:39:48,247 --> 01:39:49,282
It must be here somewhere...

1103
01:39:49,349 --> 01:39:51,727
This is somebody's
death certiﬁcate.

1104
01:39:51,784 --> 01:39:54,196
What?
- Some Harish... chandm“

1105
01:39:54,587 --> 01:39:55,861
What is all this?

1106
01:39:58,091 --> 01:40:00,071
The boy is Arjun Waghmare right?
- Yes...

1107
01:40:00,827 --> 01:40:02,306
I'll have to disqualify this boy...

1108
01:40:02,362 --> 01:40:04,137
Rathod... give me 2 minutes.

1109
01:40:04,197 --> 01:40:05,175
Please...

1110
01:40:05,231 --> 01:40:06,266
Arjun...

1111
01:40:07,066 --> 01:40:09,342
Arjun...
where is your birth certiﬁcate?

1112
01:40:10,136 --> 01:40:13,709
Your father's death
certiﬁcate has been submitted...

1113
01:40:14,173 --> 01:40:16,119
Mother must have... by mistake.

1114
01:40:16,709 --> 01:40:18,620
She has it...

1115
01:40:18,945 --> 01:40:20,185
She has it...

1116
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,226
The mother has it.
She is getting it.

1117
01:40:23,282 --> 01:40:26,092
I can't wait for this boy
for this long...

1118
01:40:26,152 --> 01:40:27,722
But she is coming...

1119
01:40:27,787 --> 01:40:30,097
Aunty!
Sir is calling you over there.

1120
01:40:31,224 --> 01:40:32,760
Oh God! Hope everything is okay...

1121
01:40:32,825 --> 01:40:34,099
Excuse me..

1122
01:40:36,262 --> 01:40:37,832
There she is!

1123
01:40:39,932 --> 01:40:41,309
I have it, I have it...

1124
01:40:41,567 --> 01:40:42,637
Birth certiﬁcate...

1125
01:40:42,668 --> 01:40:45,171
By mistake I...

1126
01:40:45,204 --> 01:40:46,706
Easy, easy...

1127
01:40:47,173 --> 01:40:48,652
I have it...

1128
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:50,085
Take it out.

1129
01:40:50,143 --> 01:40:52,817
It's in here somewhere...

1130
01:40:55,148 --> 01:40:57,219
Madam, please take it easy.

1131
01:40:59,852 --> 01:41:01,798
Not this...

1132
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:19,304
This seems right.

1133
01:42:20,566 --> 01:42:21,909
Let's go back on the mark.

1134
01:42:55,134 --> 01:42:57,045
There's nothing...

1135
01:42:57,170 --> 01:42:58,581
Nothing.

1136
01:42:58,638 --> 01:43:00,345
NO! No!

1137
01:43:00,606 --> 01:43:02,142
<i>Nothing!</i>

1138
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:05,348
Even this time nothing!

1139
01:43:06,012 --> 01:43:08,322
These are not seeds...

1140
01:43:08,948 --> 01:43:11,155
they are poison.

1141
01:43:11,217 --> 01:43:12,821
Tam!

1142
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:18,761
These are not seeds...
they are poison,

1143
01:43:30,102 --> 01:43:31,240
Arjun!

1144
01:43:31,304 --> 01:43:33,045
Arjun... Come.
See what's happened!

1145
01:43:33,105 --> 01:43:34,277
Father!

1146
01:43:36,108 --> 01:43:37,678
Get up!

1147
01:43:38,678 --> 01:43:40,157
Father!

1148
01:43:43,182 --> 01:43:45,788
Father...

1149
01:43:48,788 --> 01:43:50,062
Arjun!

1150
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:54,002
Run to the clinic!

1151
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:55,869
Get a doctor quickly!

1152
01:43:55,928 --> 01:43:57,236
Hurry!

1153
01:43:57,296 --> 01:44:00,243
Run to the clinic!

1154
01:44:00,299 --> 01:44:03,712
Arjun! Run! Go!

1155
01:44:34,967 --> 01:44:37,709
And it's no surprise...
Sohan Tarkar at number one,

1156
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:39,078
Jaival Shah at number two,

1157
01:44:39,138 --> 01:44:42,017
and unbelievably,
Arjun Waghmare at number three!

1158
01:44:42,041 --> 01:44:43,850
Such brilliant skill and footwork!

1159
01:44:43,909 --> 01:44:46,253
Speeding ahead with the wind
and he's number two!

1160
01:44:46,679 --> 01:44:48,625
This is going to be one tough ace“

1161
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:52,026
and Arjun is clearly on
a mission charging along.

1162
01:45:02,228 --> 01:45:04,765
And the blazing boy
has his target set.

1163
01:45:04,830 --> 01:45:07,640
Trailing on the south bank
and this is spectacular!

1164
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:11,273
Arjun marks number one, leaving
state champion Sohan Tarkar behind!

1165
01:45:11,304 --> 01:45:15,150
Pushing hard, using all his might-
look at this little wonder go.

1166
01:45:16,242 --> 01:45:18,518
He is number one
at the end of lap one.

1167
01:45:18,577 --> 01:45:20,284
Five more laps to go!

1168
01:46:41,026 --> 01:46:42,733
Arjun!

1169
01:47:33,145 --> 01:47:36,285
Go Arjun go!

1170
01:47:37,817 --> 01:47:40,593
Fly Arjun ﬂY!

1171
01:47:42,054 --> 01:47:43,829
Fly!

1172
01:47:45,191 --> 01:47:47,171
Ariun, carry on!

1173
01:47:50,996 --> 01:47:53,203
It's the right thing to do Arjun...

1174
01:47:53,265 --> 01:47:55,006
Do it!

1175
01:47:55,067 --> 01:47:59,209
Who can understand
the value of your tears?

1176
01:48:00,873 --> 01:48:03,547
Arjun go!

1177
01:48:03,776 --> 01:48:05,847
Arjun GO!

1178
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:13,760
Arjun GO!

1179
01:48:17,256 --> 01:48:21,796
Arjun GO!

1180
01:48:22,228 --> 01:48:25,232
That's Arjun! Our Eklava.

1181
01:48:25,498 --> 01:48:27,205
...and his Flying Wheels.

1182
01:48:27,933 --> 01:48:29,503
Arjun go!

1183
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,980
If not for yourself
do it for your friends!

1184
01:48:32,204 --> 01:48:34,684
Do it for Flying Wheels!

1185
01:48:34,874 --> 01:48:39,289
Go Arjun go!!

1186
01:48:39,545 --> 01:48:41,752
The skate slowly hitting
the tar once again.

1187
01:48:41,814 --> 01:48:42,952
And he's off!

1188
01:48:43,015 --> 01:48:47,259
Arjun Waghmare using all his might-
the crowd egging him on.

1189
01:48:47,653 --> 01:48:50,133
He's got a lot to cover up
to get back into this race

1190
01:48:50,189 --> 01:48:52,965
and it's looking really tough
at this point of time.

1191
01:48:53,526 --> 01:48:54,903
Come on!

1192
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:58,134
Ahead of him-
Rohan Budhmni at number seven.

1193
01:48:58,163 --> 01:49:01,542
The boy from Thane hasn't had
a great run so far.

1194
01:49:01,767 --> 01:49:04,646
Arjun Waghmare- covering up
the lead at the south bank

1195
01:49:04,703 --> 01:49:07,206
going full might, full force.

1196
01:49:09,642 --> 01:49:11,679
And he's closing in
and he's taken him

1197
01:49:11,710 --> 01:49:13,087
from the outside edge.

1198
01:49:13,145 --> 01:49:16,615
Going to number eight to seven
within a distance of hundred metres.

1199
01:49:16,815 --> 01:49:20,957
Look at him go.

1200
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:23,864
Oh my god!
This is unbelievable.

1201
01:49:23,923 --> 01:49:26,062
Vansh is ﬁnding it difﬁcult
to maintain his speed

1202
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:27,604
and he slips away!

1203
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:30,732
Lets go of the inner lane
and Waghmare capitalizes on it.

1204
01:49:30,796 --> 01:49:33,834
Gets in through the inside edge
and secures his spot at number 6.

1205
01:49:33,899 --> 01:49:36,277
Arjun, 5 more skaters to go!

1206
01:49:36,835 --> 01:49:38,678
Up ahead, we have Bhumik.

1207
01:49:38,737 --> 01:49:40,683
Not wanting to let go
of his inner lane...

1208
01:49:40,739 --> 01:49:43,151
trying every push
to keep Naytik at bay.

1209
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:46,655
I must say it's very unsportsman
like for the skaters.

1210
01:49:46,712 --> 01:49:48,817
And Arjun ﬁnds his way
through the battle!

1211
01:49:48,881 --> 01:49:50,952
Their loss is Waghmare's gain.

1212
01:49:51,016 --> 01:49:53,189
Oh my god! He has done it again.

1213
01:49:56,288 --> 01:49:58,268
Come on! Come on!

1214
01:49:59,725 --> 01:50:03,764
And there's Aamir Shaikh,
famous for his sharp mind games.

1215
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:08,703
And he is blocking him,
not allowing him to get past.

1216
01:50:10,669 --> 01:50:12,876
Arjun struggling to ﬁnd a way out.

1217
01:50:12,938 --> 01:50:15,976
Aamir blocking every attempt
of his to get ahead.

1218
01:50:22,715 --> 01:50:24,092
And what is this?

1219
01:50:24,149 --> 01:50:28,620
Arjun slowing down.
He is letting it go once again.

1220
01:50:28,687 --> 01:50:30,064
Has the run been too daunting
for this debutant?

1221
01:50:30,122 --> 01:50:33,660
Aamir Shaikh looks extremely
pleased with himself.

1222
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,265
We'll lose the race this way!
Go!

1223
01:50:38,597 --> 01:50:39,575
Now.

1224
01:50:39,632 --> 01:50:41,077
I can't believe this!

1225
01:50:41,133 --> 01:50:43,340
A burst of speed
from the little boy.

1226
01:50:43,569 --> 01:50:45,879
It's a trick! A trickier trick.

1227
01:50:54,113 --> 01:50:56,354
He's taken Shaikh
completely by surprise.

1228
01:50:56,615 --> 01:50:57,958
and he is going all out.

1229
01:50:58,017 --> 01:50:59,894
Speeding like never before.

1230
01:50:59,952 --> 01:51:01,863
Spellbound- that's what we all are.

1231
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,922
Come on!

1232
01:51:09,895 --> 01:51:11,772
Arjun... Last lap.

1233
01:51:16,001 --> 01:51:17,207
Come on...

1234
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:27,256
It all boils down to this ﬁnal lap.

1235
01:51:27,746 --> 01:51:30,852
Sohan Tarkar continues to lead
the pack at number one.

1236
01:51:30,916 --> 01:51:32,224
Jaival at number two.

1237
01:51:32,284 --> 01:51:34,093
Arjun Waghmare at number three“

1238
01:51:34,119 --> 01:51:36,690
closely followed by Aamir
at number four.

1239
01:51:36,922 --> 01:51:40,870
There's no doubt that this one's
going to be one close ﬁnish.

1240
01:51:44,329 --> 01:51:46,570
Within reaching distance
of the ﬁnish,

1241
01:51:46,632 --> 01:51:48,839
nothing to set the four apart.

1242
01:51:49,001 --> 01:51:51,038
Who is going to win this one?

1243
01:51:51,203 --> 01:51:54,116
Just a straight run of fifty
meters left to the finish.

1244
01:51:54,173 --> 01:51:57,313
A last burst of speed
as they give it their all.

1245
01:52:04,183 --> 01:52:09,963
Twenty meters from the ﬁnish now
and it is still too close to call.

1246
01:52:18,197 --> 01:52:20,973
YES!

1247
01:52:57,603 --> 01:52:59,913
And this is unbelievable.

1248
01:52:59,972 --> 01:53:02,680
Absolutely unbelievable.

1249
01:53:02,875 --> 01:53:04,980
Arjun Waghmare has done it.

1250
01:53:05,577 --> 01:53:10,048
His first state race,
his first championship.

1251
01:53:10,115 --> 01:53:11,685
What a victory!

1252
01:53:12,317 --> 01:53:16,231
Arjun Harishchandm Waghmare
bags the gold.

1253
01:53:27,699 --> 01:53:28,837
He won!

1254
01:55:14,273 --> 01:55:17,811
Let's see if you all
can recognize this.

1255
01:55:17,876 --> 01:55:19,685
What letter is this?

1256
01:55:19,745 --> 01:55:20,780
IAI

1257
01:55:20,846 --> 01:55:23,156
Very good children!
What letter is this?

1258
01:55:23,215 --> 01:55:24,193
IAI

1259
01:55:24,249 --> 01:55:25,660
Very good!

1260
01:55:25,717 --> 01:55:27,993
Letter 'A'!

1261
01:55:28,186 --> 01:55:29,164
Aye!

1262
01:55:29,221 --> 01:55:30,723
<i>F}?</i>

1263
01:55:30,789 --> 01:55:31,893
Aye!

1264
01:55:32,891 --> 01:55:34,996
Boys! What's happening?

1265
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:36,300
What letter is this?

1266
01:55:36,561 --> 01:55:37,301
IAI

1267
01:55:37,562 --> 01:55:38,267
Very smart.

1268
01:55:38,530 --> 01:55:40,271
Shall we all clap for ourselves?

1269
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:44,179
Very smart children.
Can the whole class repeat?

1270
01:55:44,236 --> 01:55:46,147
If we don't like it...
We'll run off...

1271
01:55:47,039 --> 01:55:48,780
Very smart children.

1272
01:55:49,074 --> 01:55:50,781
'Hot Embers'

1273
01:55:51,576 --> 01:55:57,720
Just the way hot embers singe the
ﬁngers before you earn the bread,

1274
01:55:58,050 --> 01:56:04,194
the fruit of life too, you shall get
when you have walked on hot coals

1275
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:08,665
...that's the order of life.

1276
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:14,700
Wow Champ...

1277
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,071
Straight from here
