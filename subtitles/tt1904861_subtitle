Honest company?"

" Who is company?
Honest company?"

" When you get trouble in life.."

23
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:17,312
" The juice of grapes is
a good company."

24
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:22,153
" Even when you get drunk
with the grape juice.."

25
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:27,095
..aren't we a good company?"

26
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:33,965

Xavier, take him and go. Go. Go.

32
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,952
You get in the car.

Go. Go. Go. Go.

Gawda.

36

There is only one king for
this Chinatown.

37
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,022
Me. Gawda.

38
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:49,263
ln this Chinatown,
in this Goa only one man..

39
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,767
..should have a gambling centre.

40
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,532
Now no Malayalee shall
dare come here.

41
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,833
None.

42
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,997
This is the new Goa.

43
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,237
The only city where gambling
is legal in lndia.

44
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,683
Now there is a change in the name
and size of the gambling centers.

45
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,626
ln place of clubs, casinos.

46
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,964
lnstead of three cards it
become blackjack and poker.

47
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:33,264
As lndian and foreigners
came with lakhs..

48
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,133

Boss.

At least now don't push me like a dog.

00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,714
Sir, my hands are paining
massaging you.

Welcome to tiger's room.

Malayalee?

66
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,926
Surely. Watch, purse, chain and
trunk, keep everything.

67
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:05,961
Come here..
- Sir..

68
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,223
Hey, shut up.

00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:07,956
No chain, boss.

70
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,226
No chain?
Do you have the waist band?

71
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,528
Yes, l have.
- Then remove it.

72
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,228
Hey sir, that..
- Remove it, l say.

73
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:15,799
Sir. Here.

74
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,909
What is this? A twine? l will..

75
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,739
Hey sir, don't do anything to me.
l came here asking for a place.

76
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,778
To Jackpot casino..

77
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,077
l always love people who come to gamble.

78
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,880
l change the people who come with
money into people who are paupers.

79
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:30,612
Sir l..

80
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,519
But you, l will change you
to a dead body.

81
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,954
Run away.
- Sir, my trunk.

82
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:35,889
Trunk, run along l say.

83
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,926
Run! Run! Run! Run!

84
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,599
This fellow has come to gamble
in torn underwear?

85
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,034
Sir, there is only one Bhutan lottery.

86
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,643
Then we are sure we won't
get any money.

87
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:54,835
Where is the watch?

88
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,609
Why is this watch like this?

89
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,942
Hey, this only a strap. Hey..

90
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,348
What happened, sir?

91
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,616
Hey, my purse is missing.
That beggar stole my purse.

92
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,690
Go and catch him.

93
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:12,830
Now l understood. His father, mother,
his whole family are Malayalees.

94
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,397
Or else he wouldn't have done like this.

95
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,194
l don't have money even to buy an egg.

96
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,974
Excuse me, are you in the guest list?

97
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,153
l want to meet Advocate Daniel.

98
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,549
Oh sorry sir, please.
- Thank you. Thank you.

99
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,625
l am Zakharia.
Coming from Chennai.

100
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,990
l had received a lawyer's notice.

101
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,096
l had sent that lawyer's notice.

102
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,493
So, you are the lawyer?
- Yes.

103
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,694
Though l was very busy, l came running
here as it was lawyer's notice.

104
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,429
There is no other problem, isn't it?

105
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,164
No problem. Come.

106
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,838
Do you know these people?

107
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,011
This is my father.

108
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,782
This is Xavier Uncle, Jaikishen Uncle.

109
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,960
This is Gomez Uncle.
- Good.

110
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,528
This Gomez Uncle has returned
now after 25 years

111
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,200
This casino belongs to him.

112
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,805
l can't believe it.
- Yes.

113
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,535
lt is for him that l searched and
sent lawyer's notice.

114
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,609
Come.

115
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,342
Sir.
- Yes?

116
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,882
This is Zakharia

117
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,626
Uncle.

118
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,789
Son, Zakharia you grew up
to be a big man.

119
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,635
Dear..
- What, dad?

120
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,104
This is Zakharia.

121
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,334
Daughter. Emily.

122
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,476
Hello.
- Hi.

123
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,706
Zakharia sit.
- No. You sit. l will stand.

124
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,247
What do you do in Chennai?

125
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,516
l am in Chennai for many years.

126
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,415
Oh! What do you do in Chennai?

127
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,850
ln the main city of Chennai.

128
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,321
Not that. What do you do in Chennai?

129
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,325
Uncle.

130
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,722
Now you need not do any thing.

131
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:28,127
l started this for you all.
For the sake of my friend's children.

132
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,233
No. No.

133
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,337
After searching for one whole year
l got the details of you three people.

134
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,000
Three people?
- Yes.

135
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,647
Yes. Three people. Xavier's son
Mathu Kutty and Jaikeshen's son Binoy.

136
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,372
One was not in that place.

137
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,178
The other sent back the registered
letter saying he won't take it.

138
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,480
Only then l came, isn't it?

139
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,022
Yes. Before l die l have to
hand over this to you all.

140
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,286
Hence Zakharia has to bring
these two also here.

141
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,862
Uncle, one doesn't accept
the letter..

142
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,228
..and the other we don't know
where he is.. Only l came.

143
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,299
Now you come here.

144
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,969
One minute..

145
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,799
Don't think you alone will get it.
- Hey, l didn't think so.

146
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,466
l understood that. You will get it
only when they also come..

147
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,111
..or the enquiry will go on
in many ways.

148
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,281
Now where should l go?
- l will tell you.

149
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,482
Brother, do you know where Binoy is?

150
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,059
There are hundreds of Binoys' here.

151
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,060
Kadapuram Binoy,
Katti Binoy who amongst them?

152
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,823
Like this, a little short..

153
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,798
Father's name, nick name,
anything like that?

154
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,566
This Binoy doesn't have father.

155
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,566
Now if he doesn't have father,
then it is the other Binoy.

156
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,403
You can't see him today.
- Why?

157
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,078
Today, his lover is getting married.

158
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,411
Lover's ..
- Wedding.

159
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,910
Every five, six months the guy is in love.

160
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,914
Then his lover will obviously
marry another man.

161
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,246
His work is to go there and
pick up fight.

162
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:01,583
Stop, you girl who cheated me,
this is my last gift for you

163
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,091
l am coming.

164
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,825
Bye. Bye.

165
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:17,438
Mother. Don't stand there..
Dog! Monkeys! Save me!

166
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,875
Uproot the tree.
- They will kill me like this.

167
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:32,281
When l loved you for so many years..
..you married some one else?

168
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,116
Don't fall at my feet.

169
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,623
The other day l removed this and
showed and said to forget me.

170
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,955
You said after you got
engaged, isn't it?

171
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:38,788
You..

172
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,466
Dear, is this how misfortune
comes to some one?

173
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,635
Misfortune? Misfortune is not
for me. lt is for you.

174
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,135
The one who you married
is Tsunami. Tsunami.

175
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:48,798
Catch you..

176
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,976
Hey drummers, play the drums
and go on.

177
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,643
Hey
- What son?

178
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,143
l brought this branch from above,
don't step on it.

179
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,143
You idiot.

180
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:01,308
Hey, he is an apt person for you.
- What?

181
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,154
Let's go.
- Take him and go.

182
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,824
l don't care if you don't marry me.
You are my sixth girl.

183
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,995
Hey man, one girl will do
some nonsense..

184
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,163
..and behind her you will walk
blowing this trumpet?

185
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,422
Find a job and make a living.

186
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,393
Must be going to have a feast.

187
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,900
All of you will suffer from
diarrhea and vomiting.

188
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,343
You saved my life, tree.

189
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,274
lf you were some where else..
..then you would be of some other use.

190
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:33,175
Tonight will be her consummation night.
l should create a ruckus.

191
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,447
Who is this conductor?

192
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,956
lt is Binoy, isn't it?
- What if he's not?

193
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,191
My name is Zakharia,
do you know me?

194
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,228
Then tell me, who l am?

195
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,962
You are James Uncle, isn't it?

196
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:55,363
l gave a letter that is true.
And if you are here to beat me for that..

197
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,201
..you should do so in this condition.

198
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,036
lf you are going to make me
stand up and beat me..

199
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,702
..then l don't have the strength to fall.
Please co-operate, brother.

200
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,706
Don't you remember me?
Try to remember.

201
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,887
ln Goa.. Uncle David's son. Zakharia

202
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,030
Now l will explain you everything
in detail one the way.

203
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,698
You must only understand
this much that..

204
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,026
..we three should reach Goa
as soon as possible.

205
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,863
Just like l found you now
l have to go find Mathukutty.

206
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,630
Wonder on which mountain he is.

207
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,706
You come here.
Do you remember?

208
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:36,370
ln childhood l.. Hey.. do you hear
anything that l say?

209
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,209
Hey, l drowned in the ocean.

210
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,383
Do you hear anything that l say?

211
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,383
Now, l can't come suddenly like that.

212
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,987
l have a lot of work.

213
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,054
Today l have to create ruckus
on her consummation night.

214
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,055
Creating ruckus on her consummation
night isn't an easy.

215
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,058
Chase her, beat her up,
lCU, blood group, Oh!

216
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,495
Come next Saturday.
- Hey you, l didn't come to beg.

217
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,396
To save all three of us,

218
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:02,063
uncle Gomez and his daughter..
..are waiting with millions and a Casino in Goa.

219
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,401
Come if you want,
or l will eat it all alone.

220
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,738
Hey. Who you said is waiting?
- Uncle Gomez.

221
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,573
Not that, the other one?
- Property worth millions.

222
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,248
Hey, barring that..
- Casino.

223
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,917
Daughter is there, isn't it?
- Above?

224
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,087
No, you said daughter, isn't ..
- l had said. Only daughter.

225
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,416
And you play with me?
How old is she?- 65

226
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:27,097
65? Why didn't you tell me?
- Hey stupid, uncle Gomez is 65 now.

227
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,597
When we left from there,
his wife was pregnant.

228
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:33,601
Now she must be 25 years old.
Only daughter of 25.

229
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,102
Okay. Then let us go.

230
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,610
Why are you going in huff?

231
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,209
What?

232
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:48,943
Have you hidden it? Take it out.

233
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,282
Just fine.

234
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,287
Whenever you've call me,
l'll also have it.

235
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,426
This is the place. Meditation centre.

236
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,579
Sister.
- Came here too?

237
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,349
What is all this?

238
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,515
You have caged a pigeon
that was flying freely.

239
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,514
What's the matter?

240
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,280
Why did you confine Mathukutty
in this Meditation centre?

241
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,859
l will do so that, is my wish?
Let me see if l can reform him.

242
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,462
Reform him? Mathukutty?

243
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,200
lf he's going somewhere and
if there is some crooked way..

244
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,197
..in between it is by that way
he usually goes.

245
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,370
Now who will reform him?

246
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,768
Mathukutty, the path on which
you were walking so long..

247
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,043
..was filled with many dangers, isn't it?

248
00:20:51,483 --> 00:21:01,449
Team[xMS]

249
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:06,828
What?

250
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,561
Any dangerous way is
a short cut for Mathukutty.

251
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,666
Understand?

252
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,732
lf you try to stop below Mathukutty
will fly above.

253
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,237
lf you put me in the nose.

254
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,571
l'll come out through the mouth.
That is Mathukutty's policy.

255
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,475
Mathukutty's ..
- Policy.

256
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,654
What is that on your ear?

257
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,864
There was a prayer in
Malayatoor church. An earring.

258
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,000
Earring?
- Yes, earring.

259
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,096
l know you have many enemies.

260
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,106
lf you do have a problem then you
should solve it with talks.

261
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,107
My usual habit is to talk
to them father.

262
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,780
How do you talk to them?

263
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,611
You idiot.
- Talk politely, Mathukutty.

264
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:09,621
ldiot.- Mathukutty, don't you know
how to talk politely?

265
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,795
Oh, l know.

266
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,630
Your bad sons who..

267
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,706
To see how good and
innocent you are.

268
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,866
That..
- Close your eyes.

269
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:25,805
Why, father?

270
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,538
Close your eyes. And recall all
your enemies in your mind.

271
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:48,026
Now, say...l have pardoned all of you.

272
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,759
l should say?
- Then should l say?

273
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,034
l will say.
- Then say it.

274
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,273
Pardoned.

275
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,739
Not like that, say it clearly
and loudly.

276
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,506
l..

277
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,747
Have..

278
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,519
Pardoned all of you.

279
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,392
Praise the Lord

280
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,501
Dear, even Lord Jesus wouldn't have
gone through so many..

281
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,072
..difficulties and experiences.

282
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,902
Now your face looks much brighter.

283
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,738
You are the girl who used to encourage me
when l used beat up people before.

284
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,471
Now what happened to you, dear?
Why do you slam me on the cross?

285
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,843
Because, when l close my eyes
l saw you dead..

286
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,812
with your hands and limb cut
and lying in pieces.- Oh, no.

287
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,252
l don't want that any more.
- Okay, l stopped.

288
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,325
This Mathukutty will do as you say.
That is my policy.

289
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,755
Father.

290
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:56,332
Rosamma. Not like as l thought.
His heart changed quite fast.

291
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,263
Praise the Lord.

292
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,433
Then shall l leave father?

293
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,834
Where to?
Now you are the son of Jesus.

294
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,274
Son of Jesus?
- Rosamma?

295
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,773
What?
- Let him stay here for two months.

296
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,274
Okay, father.
- Two months?

297
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,202
Praise the Lord.

298
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:15,782
Tell me, brother.

299
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:20,621
Two guys are after me
to see Mathukutty

300
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,294
Must be some quotation party.
- So what if they are?

301
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,862
He can come later on four wheels
and meditate, isn't it?

302
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,233
lf they come in here
then l will turn them blind.

303
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,970
Mathukutty.
- Didn't you hear her? Go from here.

304
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,478
Go. lf you go to see Mathukutty then you
will go blind. lf Rosamma says it happens.

305
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,250
Praise the name of Jesus.

306
00:24:47,452 --> 00:25:06,566
Praise the name of Jesus.
- Praise the name of Jesus.

307
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:34,264
Praise the name of Jesus.
- Praise the name of Jesus.

308
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:38,630
Praise the name of Jesus.
- Praise the name of Jesus.

309
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:42,830
You come here.
Hey, do you recognize me?

310
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:47,507
Yes. That.. Yes.
Don't you remember me?

311
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,237
Go on say it.

312
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,083
Praise the Lord!

313
00:25:52,784 --> 00:26:01,590
l am old David Uncle's son.
Zach.. Zach.. Zach.. Zakharia

314
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,488
Hey, how is everything?
- Hey, my neck is..

315
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:04,923
Hey how is everything man?

316
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,928
Leave that man's neck.

317
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,365
l always used to tell you
of Uncle David, isn't it?

318
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,596
This is David Uncle's son, Zakharia.

319
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,605
Hey, l didn't recognize you at all.

320
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,704
But l recognize though you grew up.
- How?

321
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:23,436
You look same like uncle Xaiver
- Then let us have tea. Do you want?

322
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:24,342
l don't want.

323
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,751
Then uncle Gomez came back, isn't it?

324
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,426
Not empty-handed,
but with millions of rupees..

325
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,925
..one casino. He has written
all that in our names.

326
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,098
We will go there.
Tell him, Uncle we have come.

327
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,598
Take the money and property in writing
and come back by the next train. That is all.

328
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:48,102
Shall we go?
- Now, we will go, but..

329
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:54,039
Don't lie to me.
Telling story of uncle Gomez..

330
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,946
lt is for some quotation work, isn't it?

331
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,610
What is the name of that girl?
- Rosamma.

332
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:02,275
My Rosamma, l am tired.
There is money in millions.

333
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,715
l heard.
- Casino.

334
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,551
l heard that too. l won't let him go
from here till two months.

335
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,387
Two months? That is not possible.
As quickly as possible..

336
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,058
Anyway l will go from here
only with you.

337
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,135
ls it that serious?- That serious.
Just get the rose to agree.

338
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:22,467
Come.

339
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,304
Come. Come. Come.

340
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,809
Don't kill me. Who is it?

341
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:38,721
Couldn't you knock before coming inside?
Who is this?

342
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,414
This is Mathukutty.
- Hey, who is this?

343
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,924
You move, doesn't Mathukutty
know this man?

344
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:50,092
Uncle Jaikishen's son Binoy
- Hey Binoy?

345
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,600
Don't kiss me.

346
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,402
Tell him not to play and
try to touch me.

347
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,840
Don't look like this.
The fellow is a little hot tempered.

348
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,617
All of you get inside the car.
The rest we will talk on the way.

349
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,516
Rosamma, if you sit on the back seat..
- ..then, l too will sit on the back seat.

350
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,557
Rosamma, if you sit on the front seat..
- ..then l too will sit on the front seat.

351
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,693
What a problem he is.
Rosamma, get in here.

352
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,524
Come. Come. Mathukutty get in.
- You aren't coming?

353
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,026
Now safe.

354
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,794
My God. How will l reach till
Goa with these two?

355
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,699
Are you coming?
- l am coming.

356
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,431
Hey, white man, want to sit in front?
No problem?

357
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:44,751
Let me see how she looks
from this mobile camera.

358
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,824
Brother, can you give me the phone?
- What?

00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,058
Will you give me that phone?
Phone.

00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,921
Am l a telephone booth to

00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,569
Sorry, l don't want. Praise the Lord.

362
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,170
Zakharia, why is he bothering me?

363
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,907
Whatever he sees
he wants immediately.

364
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,406
Doesn't allow me to click a snap.
Difficult.

365
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,909
Hello, keep your hand inside.
- Hand.

366
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:17,818

Don't go to talk.
- To see. To see.

369
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,269
What if l put both my legs out?

370
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,601
Did he trip his legs?
- Where do you see and drive?

371
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,278
Looks like someone fell down.
- Who is the driver of the car?

372
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,276
l am not driving. lt is him.

373
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:55,852
Hey, it is him who has put his legs outside.
- Can't put hand and head out, isn't it?

374
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,123
Praise the Lord.

375
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:03,232
Jesus, someone save me. Zakharia.

376
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:09,801
Now don't beat me.
- Move.

377
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:18,138
Hey Zakharia is this time to buy fish?
These guys are beating me.

378
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,318
Come soon and
get me free from them.

379
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:37,024
Team[xMS]

Praise the Lord.

381
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:45,001
lf you are not men

382
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,004
What is the problem?

383
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,681
What is the problem?
- Hey, it is Mathukutty run from here.

384
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:53,609
Why all are running from here?

385
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,014
Hey guys, see how they ran fearing me?

386
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,193
Don't waste time, get in the car.

387

00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,860
Praise the Lord always.

389
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:14,202
Like l have pardoned you. my enemy,
so you should pardon me, your enemy.

390
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,373
Big deal, l'll surely forgive you.

391
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:20,475
But before that you should
fall here, full of blood.

392
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,543
Only then your silence,
peace, and pardon, etc.

393
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,947
Brother, we will leave the
path of violence and evil..

394
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,882
..and welcome the path of
peace and goodness.

395
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,720
Should l interfere?
- Praise the Lord.

396
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:37,061
We can accept that too.
You go with a girl very dearly, isn't it?

397
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:43,064
Rosamma.. with her we all will
accept the path of love. lsn't it?

398
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,733
Then there is another way.
l will show it to you.

399
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,246
Did he remove a sword?
- Yes. Just go and help.

400
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:07,356
l am not in mood. l feel nauseated.

401
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,594
He is flying.

402
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,167
Come.

403
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:33,778
Come.

404
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,050
Hey sir, l came to buy fish.

405
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,913
ls this cycle enough to go on
the path of love?

406
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,362
l am a decent guy.

407
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,539
l am not from this place.

408
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,752
My mother.

409
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,604

Phone.
- l don't want.

412
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,353
Mathukutty you had a brother, isn't it?

413
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,017
Yes l did, but he's not here now.

414
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,086
Why is he not here?
- l told you he is not here.

415
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:03,190
lt is this Rosamma's father
who brought us up

416
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:09,400
He was good in studies. Her father sold
everything and made him a doctor.

417
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,843
He expected to get her married
to him so he did like that.

418
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,081
He finished his studies married
another girl and went away.

419
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,045
Hey. Now only l am left for her.

420
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,713
l will get her married to
a bigger doctor than him.

421
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,725
Yes, he will come,
a big doctor will come.

422
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,223
He will surely come.

423
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:36,395
lf it happens as this Zakharia says whatever
uncle Gomez gives, you will get all that.

424
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,410
What?

425
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,011
Shall we go?

426
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,419
Did you hear?

427
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,504
The Goa Police has successfully
raided and uncovered..

428
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,640
..a big cache of illegal drugs
in the city.

429
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,275
Please, keep our eyes open
for the dealers.

430
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,378
Who is the group behind this?

431
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,552
This is a gang operation.
We have to find them.

432
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,778
Who is the informer?
- Sorry, we cannot reveal it now.

433
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:34,116
Can you tell us how much it is worth?
- lt is worth around 25 crores.

434
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,787
No time. But we will catch them in seven days.
- ls there any specific information?

435
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:37,460
No comments.

436
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:40,290
The police is still behind
this big drug mafia.

437
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,290
This is Emily, with cameraman Ravi
for V TV

The media is here now.

442
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,143
Will police take any action
on drug mafia?

443
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,651
We hear that the drug mafia people
will vanish within a day.

444
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,982
Can we be sure of your support
and help in this?

445
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,819
Yes, of course. Sure.
l want to assure all of you..

446
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,753
..that we will sweep of the drug mafia
not only from this state..

447
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,990

00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,001
Sure, sir.
- We will take all possible action.

449
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,005
No, l will talk to you all later.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

450
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,083
You are from Kerala, right?
- Yes, sir.

451
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,676
Who is the informer?
- l don't know, sir.

452
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:40,521
As the information was all true
we did not trace much.

453
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,358
lf we do trace him and what if he
stops giving the information?

454
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,958
Okay, keep it up.
- Thank you, sir.

455
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:12,479
Team[xMS]

456
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,634
Not one or two crores,

457
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,563
but your police has caught
a full 100 crores worth drugs.

458
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:32,172
Your police and also..
..under your nose?

459
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,068
Cool down Gawda. Cool down.

460
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,904
See, this is not my mistake.

461
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,674
lf the police get any information
about you,

462
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,348
then one of your man must
be giving the information.

463
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:46,245
You correct your mistake and
then come to my house to lecture me.

464
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:52,324
l'll handle that.. But if one more
raid takes place then..

465
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,088
..everything will be over. Everything.

466
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,260
Then what do you want?

467
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:03,268
You want me to stop police raiding you?
Not to confiscate the drugs?

468
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,276
l am ready to finish everything.

469
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,038
l will resign as Home Minister.

470
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,270
ls that what you want?

471
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:17,947
l didn't make you a Home Minister to go..

472
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:24,955
..when you wish but to work as per
my wishes. Now, you have only way out.

473
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,559
Going up with my help.

474
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,129
Hi, Uncle.

475
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:35,531
Hi, Chandni. l came to know
of your social work.

476
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,569
Orphanage, divine homes. Good.

477
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,307
These are good places to step
into politics.

478
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,710
There is no politics in this.
lt is just my hobby. That is all.

479
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,849
Dear, go inside.
- Okay, daddy.

480
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,148
There is only a little time for the elections.

481
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,988
lt is good that we all live together.

482
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:00,319
Being with everyone is good for all of us.

483
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,165
For all.

484
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,003

You are the only Malayalee in this group.
- Don't know, sir.

00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,084
The one who got all the information
- l don't know, sir.

Tell the truth.
- l don't know, sir

490
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:33,523
Tell the truth. Look at me.
Who is the informer?

491
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,958
l don't know, sir.
l don't know that informer.

492
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:45,866
The police said whoever is behind this they
will catch him within seven days, isn't it?

493
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:50,546
Before that, l will catch him.
Whoever that informer is.

494
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,333
Hi Rose, after a long journey.

495

They say, Jaggubhai is in Goa, is it true?

498
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,168
You don't know Jaggubhai?

499
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,836
Hey, don't get angry, we will find out.

All this is for the three of us.

506
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,879
These women?

507
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:03,052
Hey, just be good till we get it.

00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,566
Uncle, here l brought them.

510

Come. Come. Come.
Uncle Jaikrishnan's son, Binoy.

512
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,426
Uncle Xavier's son Mathukutty.

513
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,155
Have you brought any identity proof?

514
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:46,488
Have a license.

515
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:51,430
We don't need all that.
The one standing in front is my Xavier.

516
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,703
Uncle. After a long time.
l am Binoy, Uncle.

517
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,934
People say that l look like my dad.

518
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,776
This is my daughter.

519
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:19,786


520
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:26,230
Mathukutty what is your
opinion about our place?

521
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,173
Nothing like that.
- Meaning..

522
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:39,508
Meaning.. a poor slave of his sister.
That is the opinion.

523
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:44,020
How come 32 petty cases
are in your name?

524
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,014
l don't know.

525
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,860
Zakharia had sent an e-mail
and let me know.

526
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:58,531
You did it? Congrats.
- Thank you. No mention.

527
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,362
Don't look at him.

528
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,798
l also called father at the
meditation centre and asked.

529
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,876
Brilliant?

530
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,542
Father said that you are a bulldozer.

531
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:15,376
lf no control, you will be razing
everything to ground.

532
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,749
And the driver of it is Rosamma.
- Not that.

533
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:25,387
Now, how is our man? You.

534
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:30,889
Hey, l don't go to any fights.
l don't like that all. Hey.

535
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,729
lt is like that, isn't it?
When you get all the beatings..

536
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,734
..then where do you get
time to retaliate?

537
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:43,240
Now what is the number
of love failure suicide attempt?

538
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,740
Suicide attempt.

539
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,416
Uncle, the sixth one.

540
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:55,416
Not six, seven.
- Seven?

541
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,653
Yes, seven. The seventh one is me, dad.
Love letter, he gave me.

542
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,825
The letter became a stab.

543
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:12,108
My dear, Mily. Mily? What is that thing?

544
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,435
l don't know.

545
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:18,272
He swallowed the 'E ' and
wrote the rest. lsn't it?

546
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,452
From the very minute l heard from Zakharia..

547
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:35,964
..my eyes are longing to see you.
My tongue is eager to talk to you.

548
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,963
Without others knowing if you please keep..

549
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:44,368
.. some secret minutes specially for me,
then l will open my heart.

550
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,136
What is this, a bypass surgery?

551
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:52,646
Actually this was a poetry on bypass surgery
but it's title got changed to a girl's name.

552
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,317
Smart.

553
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,487
Rosamma. lsn't meditation a good
medicine for such people?

554
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,485
Yes, of course. Very good.

555
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,655
Have to stay there at least
for six months.

556
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,093
Uncle, move. Leave it to me.

557
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:09,492
Let them go to meditation centre as they wish.
We can take them somewhere.

558
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,668
Then Uncle, Hi..
- Hi..

559
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:16,495
l am there to take care of things here.
- Okay, Okay, you come here.

560
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,937
Okay, please. Move. Move.

561
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:25,179
l won't talk to you. l am angry.
You nipped it in the bud, isn't it?

562
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,850
l will give to someone else?
What do you say?

563
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,620
Good that you told about your friends.
- Oh, thanks Uncle.

564
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,291
But that is a not what a good friend does.

565
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,194
Do you understand me?
- Clearly.

566
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,022
lf there is any problem with
friends then you should..

567
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,291
..tell them on their face and
you should not tell others about it.

568
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:49,938
Such people were called 'P ara' in our time.
Now what they call him?

569
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:55,039
Now.. Uncle, now also they call that 'para'
- Really?

570
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:55,973
Really.

571
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,982
Did you see we all were together
like the same flesh and blood?

572
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:06,547
By the grace of God l could get
to see the children of my friends.

573
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:10,386
Now you must be together like this.
You must be like the same flesh and blood.

574
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,561
Okay, sir.

575
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,227

Smile. All of you smile.

582
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,125
What is that?
- That is a dance floor.

583
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,295
lt will be like this every day?

584
00:47:56,506 --> 00:48:00,306
Everyday these ladies will come here? Really?

00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,478
Wow, l like to dance.

586
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,558
My dear Mathukutty, you only think.

Not possible. Come here.

589
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:45,176
Mathukutty, we'll sell it off.

590
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,017
Then divide it equally amongst us three.

591
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:50,352
Sell it? l'll beat you up and
change your shape.

592
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,858
What he said is,
we three should run this place.

593
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,292

Empty? Empty purse in our den?
Big boss and a poor man.

608
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,968
Who are you?

609
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:21,783

Please, let me out by opening the door.

610
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,944
You must let me out.

00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:32,190
A working watch, washed clothes, remove.

00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:07,296
Yes, after naming it, people will come
searching and beat us here.

619
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:08,691
Don't twist us by your tongue.

630
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:26,132
That Chandni knows only Hindi.
l am ashamed.

631
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:34,381
Great. Great.
A passerby in the Lion's den?

Love Therapy.

675
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:19,341
Therapy of Love.
- ln reality l am a doctor.

676
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,343
Really?
- Really. l have specialized in such things.

677
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,447
l do special nursing for that.

678
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:29,851
Then can we take him inside and
see him privately?- Yes. Yes.

679
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,028
No. l don't want. No. l don't want.
- You should. You should. You should.

680
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:33,525
l said, l don't want it, isn't it?

681
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:38,364
Normally, when portion below the hip loses
sensation there won't be any feeling in the legs.

682
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,536
Yes. l don't have any feelings.

683
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,533
You don't feel anything?
- l don't have any feelings.

684
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,709
Doctor there is a treatment in Ayurveda
for this. - ls it?

685
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,377
Hey, l am allergic to Ayurveda medications.

686
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:51,046
lt is not something to be given
from inside, but orally.

687
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:51,872
Then, give it.

688
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,880
When this is given there is
a history that people..

689
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,313
..who lost sensation even above
the hips have got up and ran.

690
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,884
Then please do it for him, please.

691
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:01,655
Chandni, why should we trouble these people?
- Hey, that doesn't matter.

692
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,054
Okay a good therapy.
- Did you beat?

693
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:10,559
No.

694
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,063
Any feeling?
- No

695
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:25,571


696
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:34,853
Do you have any slight feeling?
- Not at all. l don't feel anything.

697
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,423
Then why is this man crying?

698
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,590
That is because l don't get any feeling
even after you beat me so much.

699
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,926
That is alright. We are taking this
patient for treatment.

700
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,261
Oh sure. Sure.
- Where?

701
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:50,094
We have a couple of more treatments.
A special one is, by lighting a fire under him.

702
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,103
Oh God.

703
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,338
lf you show like this l will thrash you badly.

704
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,603
You people needn't become my leader.

705
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:00,612
l too have rights here.
l am also one of you.

706
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:06,278
Do you know who that Chandni is?
She is Home Minister's daughter.

707
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,290
lf you try any more tricks
with me then l will tell..

708
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:10,959
..the Home Minister and
get you both behind bars.

709
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,287
Mind it.

710
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,292
Oh, then you love the
Home Minister's daughter?

711
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:15,964
We both are in love.

712
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,463
lf he comes to know about that love..

713
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,135
..or if we let him know of it you
will be first one to go inside.

714
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,304
Understand?
- lt won't happen like that.

715
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:23,631
lt will happen like that.

716
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:31,142
Binoy goes behind a girl
if he gets the smell of a girl.

717
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:36,979
Then the other one is Zakharia. He always
thinks of money and nothing beyond that.

718
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,986
The other one is actually a ruffian.

719
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,887
Who amongst them,
my dad is getting me married to?

720
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:47,322
Dear Emily, l am not going to getting
you married to any one of these.

721
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,931
Not forcing you also.
l just told my opinion.

722
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:54,659
Then now you said that
Mathukutty is a ruffian.

723
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:58,398
But if his father was alive
would he become like this?

724
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:06,508
His father was my Xavier. He saved my life.
l am indebted to him.

725
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:16,689
Son, l wish that one of you
marry my daughter.

726
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,854
For that my daughter also
should agree.

727
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,530
What is there in that? Just fix the
time and date for the wedding.

728
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:26,532
Son, before that you must talk to
Mathukutty we need his consent, isn't it?

729
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,704
What?
- Don't l need his consent, son?

730
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:36,038
You need his consent? Yes, correct.
He wants his consent.

731
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:42,711
Hey, that won't do.
Wife, family, children.

732
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:47,546
This is not there in the list of Mathukutty.
- Then what is in your list?

733
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,049
After l get Rosamma married off either

734
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:58,725
in Bangalore or Bombay or Calcutta some
where in a simple way l want to live as a Don.

735
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:01,563
As a Don?
- Yes. Gather a small group of people..

736
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,501
..l will form a small ruffian gang.
l will become Don.

737
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,573
Now, when this Don has wife,
family children, etc..

738
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,571
..the opposite gang will come
and kidnap these kids.

739
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,248
Or some others will come and snatch
away my wife and ask for ransom,

740
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:14,746
why do l need a headache unnecessarily?

741
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:19,420
My dear Mathukutty when Uncle is saying
so much you go and see that girl.

742
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:24,082
l have seen her, isn't it?
- Hey, this is not her. Another one.

743
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:24,919
Which other one?

744
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:28,928
A bunch of bananas. You first go and see her.
Then if you say no then let it be.

745
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:32,197
That is good.

746
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,776
Do you know Jaggubhai?
- Jaggubhai? Who is that?

747
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,706
Don't you know Jaggubhai?
- No.

748
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,276
He is a big Don here.
Three murder cases.

749
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,949
When he was let off in three murder
cases by the court..

750
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:50,947
..then l burst crackers and celebrated it.
Do you know Jaggubhai?

751
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:51,944
No.

752
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:55,120
Hey, she doesn't have general science.

753
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:02,630
No. don't give that tablet to mother.
lt will cause allergy, l told you.

754
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,135
To doctor? That won't work.

755
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,702
Don't you know that mother
can't be brought out?

756
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:16,905
Since her pressure has increased now give
her Salomax. Spelling? Salomax. 50 mg.

757
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,144
No, l have seen the respiratory system.

758
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,715
l think with the same medicine
we can rectify.

759
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:25,149
There is no problem in that. BP..
didn't l tell you, is on the lower side?

760
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,656
Do one thing, l will talk with
the senior doctor.

761
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,222
l will call you back, thank you.

762
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:34,320
What is it?
- Now are you really a doctor?

763
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,999
l will get her married to a bigger doctor
than him l will get her married.

764
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:43,494
lf uncle Gomez gives me anything..
..then she has the right to all of that.

765
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,509
Didn't l tell you?
- No

766
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,512
l am doctor Zakharia.
- Hello.

767
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,678
Hello. MBBS, FRCS.

768
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,507
You haven't married till now?

769
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,778
What is this Mathukutty,
Hospital, busy with operation..

770
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,285
.ambulance where is the time
to get married?

771
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,717
Now why did you ask that now?
- Nothing.

772
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,521
There is something.
- Let the time come for that.

773
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,025
Tell me now.
- l will tell you later.

774
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,356
Tell me now.
- l will tell you later.

775
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,191
Please.
- Tell you later, come.

776
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:14,392
lf you put on some disguise
and come to me..

777
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:17,539
l have stopped all that long time ago.
- What to do now?

778
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:22,142
One proposal has come.
- You always keep getting proposals.

779
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,041
Actually not for me, but for Rosamma.

780
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,544
The boy is a doctor, oh!

781
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:40,322
He has told me take Rosamma to him.
Get ready soon.

782
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:47,330
Binoy, will you save me
from this proposal.

783
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:51,268
Rose, now are you with
someone, something..

784
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:56,173
l have a special liking.
But if l openly say that..

785
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,180
..then that very minute l will lose him.

786
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:02,009
Look Rose, you should not
let love without being told.

787
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:06,515
And if at all you are not able to say it,
then there are many ways to express it.

788
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,214
Love is divine notjust wine.
Jesus says that..

789
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:28,934


790
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:38,545
" ..by just the habit of it?
Will l be able to say it?"

791
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:44,421
" ls it something to be hidden?
ls it a run to search for it?"

792
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:48,152
" Just by avoiding can we say it?"

793
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:52,464
" Are you the one who danced
and stopped?"

794
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:56,468
" ls it a run that is in search of me?"

795
01:02:56,672 --> 01:03:02,975
" We keep searching for love all the time."

796
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,807
" ..by just the habit of it?
Will l be able to say it?"

797
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:10,816
" ls it something to be hidden?
ls it a run to search for it?"

798
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:18,153
" Just by avoiding can we say it?"

799
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,397
Bloody beggar, can't you see with your eyes?

800
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:32,173
Uncle.

801
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:37,907
Binoy, what happened to you?

802
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:44,584
Uncle, you leave.
And Chandni you too go.

803
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:48,952
You know Binoy?
- Yes, l know him. What happened?

804
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,855
An emotional shock.
Poor fellow two years in this wheel chair.

805
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:59,529
l see. Binoy you come here.
- Uncle, leave me alone this time.

806
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:04,699
Hey, get up.
l am telling you, get up.

807
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:06,374
Oh my God.
- Can you?

808
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,308
l will try.

809
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,609
Hey, you better walk and come.

810
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:16,216
Wait let me take my leg and keep it down.

811
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:24,052
Hey, you better walk well. Walk.

812
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,725
l will break your legs. Walk.

813
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,671
Hey, what a miracle.
Chandni l am able to walk.

814
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:42,399
Thank God, l am able to walk, Chandni.
- You..

815
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,739
Run man.
- Hey l am even able to run.

816
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:59,425
" Are you a star that the
hands of my eyes touch?"

817
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:07,433
" Are you the honey of a sunflower?"

818
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:15,442
" are you a scene that the
sky has gifted here?"

819
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:23,780
" Are you the one who has
come out of a beautiful picture?"

820
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:29,955
" The skies say that love now."

821
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:33,291
" ..by just the habit of it?
Will l be able to say it?"

822
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:38,297
" ls it something to be hidden?
ls it a run to search for it?"

823
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:45,964
"just by avoiding can we say it?"

824
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:49,975
" Are you the one who danced
and stopped?"

825
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:53,808
" ls it a run that is in search of me?"

826
01:05:54,183 --> 01:06:00,144
" We keep searching for love all the time."

827
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:19,164


828
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:39,525
" Are you one of the shapes
of the beautiful moon?"

829
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:47,434
" Are you the soothing cool water
in hot summer?"

830
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:55,441
" The pearls will shine like you."
"ls itjust a magic?"

831
01:06:55,644 --> 01:07:03,779
" Will it be able to talk sweetly?"
"ls it a feeling that is expressible?"

832
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,280
" You are in search of loving
relationship always."

833
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:09,458
" Even if you stand near can it be known?"

834
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,291
" ..by just the habit of it?
Will l be able to say it?"

835
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:18,229
" ls it something to be hidden?
ls it a run to search for it?"

836
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:25,806
" Just by avoiding can we say it?"

837
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:39,311


838
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:55,300
Victory to Gawdaji!
Victory to Gawdaji!

839
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,102
Why are they shouting?

840
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:01,104
He is a rowdy like me.
He is a big goon.

841
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:05,111
He's a smuggler and
distributes drugs all over the world.

842
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,774
Do you know he was playing because
of Home Minister's support?

843
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,885
Now that won't be needed.
lf he wins he will be a minister.

844
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:14,121
As long as l live, that won't happen.

845
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:26,561
Victory to Gawdaji!
Victory to Gawdaji!

846
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,398
Victory to Gawdaji!
Victory to Gawdaji!

847
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:31,971
You go die! You fool!

848
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:38,135
Victory to Gawdaji!
Victory to Gawdaji!

849
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:42,309
Did you tell him?

850
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:46,150
Don't be troubled we have told everything.

851
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:52,324
Now that Gawda is a close friend
of Chandni's father - l see?

852
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,655
..you must introduce us to him.
- l won't come.

853
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:55,660
Hey, l too won't.

854
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,993
lf you want go and get introduced.
- lf you want go and get introduced.

855
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:06,002
Victory to Gawdaji!
- Victory to Gawdaji!

856
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,521
Hey, stop.

857
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,859
What?
- He stopped, come let us meet him.

858
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,032
Hi, Uncle?

859
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:39,040
Hey Chandni dear, what are you doing here?

860
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,869
l came to the Casino.
- Oh, you started gambling?

861
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:45,205
Chandni is not that kind of girl.
She came to see me at the Casino.

862
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,041
l see.
- My friend Binoy.

863
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,773
Greetings
- Working in the Casino?

864
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:53,217
No. No. No. l am the owner of the Casino.

865
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:56,824
The boy standing there is my partner.

866
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,822
Which Casino?
- Jackpot.

867
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:05,228
Jackpot? lsn't one Mr. Wilson is
its owner, isn't it?

868
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:10,400
Yes, he gave it to us.
We are children of his friends.

869
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:14,406
l see. What is the name of Binoy's father?
- Jaikrisnan.

870
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:19,003
Then that one?
- Mathukutty. Mathukutty come here.

871
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,747
Come here
- Why is he calling me?

872
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:41,268
Mathukutty, son of Xavier?
The Xavier of the old four star club?

873
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:47,268
Yes. Do you know my father?
- Yes, l know.

874
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:53,843
Shoot at his head. Have a good look at them.
- Why?

875
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:55,777
When we see them now
we can avoid, isn't it?

876
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,278
And that is Zakharia
Another friend of father's son

877
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:09,730
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
You are David's son, isn't it?- Yes.

878
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:17,701
The man called Wilson,
is he Gomez of the four star club?

879
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:22,970
Yes. This Uncle's full name
is Wilson Gomez.

880
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,474
Then you know Uncle too?

881
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,378
Yes, of course.
We were all old friends, isn't it?

882
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:32,145
Now, it is quite a long time we saw them.

883
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:36,821
Doesn't matter. We will renew
our friendship.

884
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,155
Now whatever anyone may give
l won't go back to our place.

885
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:42,660
l am very happy here.

886
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:47,995
Who is Binoy?

887
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:51,335
Him.

888
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:53,172
Mathukutty

889
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,946
Then who is Zakharia?

890
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:03,678
Me?
- You are under arrest.

891
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:06,187
Yes, you deserve it.

892
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:19,190


893
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,196
Uncle must have known by now
that we are arrested by now.

894
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:24,702
He will get us out very soon.
No one knows Uncle's hold here.

895
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,308
Jesus. Uncle is also in?

896
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:42,554
Uncle has a good hold.
Hey, now who will get us out from here?

897
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:45,386
Go from here.
- Why is he wielding a stick?

898
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:53,062
Where is Binoy?
- There he is standing.

899
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,229
You also?
- Welcome home.

900
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,235
The police caught you too?

901
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:02,239
The police didn't catch me,
l surrendered myself.- Why?

902
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:04,002
To remain alive.

903
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,740
Since l didn't pay the salary to those
with me they put me in here.

904
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,078
And lenders are separate.
Did you have anything?- No.

905
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,254
Before the police caught you.
- Yes, we had.

906
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,080
l didn't have anything.

907
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:18,684
Hello Mr. Warden?
What is for lunch today?

908
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:22,261
l don't get any smell.
Can't you openly tell me, you!

909
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:29,266
Thought he was a north lndian.
And he turned out to be a Malayalee.

910
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:31,663
Can'tjust walk like this?
Shouldn't go to sleep?

911
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:33,538
They are beat you

912
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,944
Shouldn't we get before we sleep?
Try to sleep. Go. Go.

913
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:48,813
Hey, l can't take it anymore,
l am very hungry.

914
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,301
Hey, don't climb on the wall,
stand a little away.

915
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,300
The ladies jail is on the other side.
- Go.

916
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,303
He is of a type who will impregnate
even across a wall.

917
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:10,975
A lonely life..
- Hey, Chandra Valainja. -Yes

918
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:18,309
The lamps that were lit
on the nine nights..

919
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,715
You are a big goon, isn't it?
Why didn't you retaliate?

920
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:23,323
You hear clap sound only when
you hit with both the hands.

921
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:24,992
Yet l heard a good noise.

922
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:30,791
l did not hear any, maybe my ear
is blocked. Gone?- Who?

923
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,160
The one who slapped me.
- He is still there.

924
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,670
Tell me when goes away.

925
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:39,669
My mat is on that side, l want to sleep.

926
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,004
Hey, what a problem.
You don't worry.

927
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:47,841
Rasamma what you said
now was not correct.

928
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:53,215
Go you.. from there.
lf you just come here then l will..

929
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,753
l will poke on your eyes.

930
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:05,889
What business do you do?

931
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,165
Casino? Or drugs?

932
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,803
Drugs? Nothing like that.

933
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,563
We don't even know what drugs are, Sir.

934
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:12,740
What is your name?

935
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:13,839
Zakharia

936
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:15,576
Work?
- Doctor sir.

937
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:19,377
Did l ask him?
- No sir.

938
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:20,741
Good boy.

939
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:22,045
Are you a doctor?

940
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,116
l was once. But not now.

941
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,615
Now a duplicate?
- No.

942
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:28,653
Then what work?

943
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,757
Hey, old car selling.

944
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,690
Why are they all like this?

945
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,695
Why do you laugh like this?

946
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:40,766
Why you stare like this?

947
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,800
Are you playing with me?

948
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,974
Hey no. Why do you beat me?
l am not from here.

949
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:47,402
Who brought you here?

950
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:48,940
Why did you do so?

951
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,205
When did l get you here?

952
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:54,780
Nandu..

953
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,880
This is a trap.

954
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,780
But l am helpless. Sorry.

955
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:07,460
Mathukutty

956
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,090
Betrayal,

957
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,929
to marry my Rosamma
what you said is a lie, isn't it?

958
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,300
That you are a doctor?

959
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:22,734
My situation is that, man.

960
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:24,570
Do you remember?

961
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,680
When we were small and fought,
mother always came running..

962
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:29,407
..asking you if anything
happened to you Mathukutty

963
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:32,917
Now she is in hiding, man.

964
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:37,323
The Chennai police is on the lookout
for her and has a notice on her.

965
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:42,128
l started a car showroom.
lt was on mother's name.

966
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:48,227
Then due to the bad deeds which l did
my mother got a bad name.

967
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:52,173
l pray that mother
shouldn't die in jail.

968
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:56,943
l want money. l will kill,
cut any one for that.

969
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:02,844
Hit me back.

970
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,780
Earlier when you beat me
l did not hit you back.

971
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:06,113
The mistake is not always mine.

972
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:09,381
Not that. One of us should
go out from here.

973
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,218
We can't even call any
one from here.

974
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:13,656
You break my head.
When they take me to the hospital..

975
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,193
..l will jump out and run.

976
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:17,865
How is that? You also can escape.
Beat me man.

977
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:20,694
Beat me.

978
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:22,999
l will..

979
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:27,870
Wait. l will..

980
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,383
Hit me on my head, man.

981
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,826
Come and hit me.

982
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,667
Oh.

983
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:03,040
l won't tolerate injustice, Mathukutty

984
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,076
Go from here.

985
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,907
Go man.

986
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:13,316
Hey, you broke my tub?

987
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,753
Now if this breaks then
how will l puddle in this?

988
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:19,188
l will show you.
Come.. Come..

989
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:21,521
The man who beat him hasn't gone.
He is here.

990
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:26,190
The man who beat him is here.
Not gone anywhere.

991
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:28,301
Hey, don't beat me.
lt is not me.

992
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:30,767
Hey, don't beat me.

993
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:36,441
Go. Go. Go.

994
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:52,457
So you are Mr. Gomez Wilson Gomez?

995
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:59,398
Here and foreign countries you destroyed
all my drug deals one by one.

996
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:02,229
You appointed a lawyer
to shatter me.

997
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:05,964
Not one man could do
so much against me.

998
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:07,664
Brilliant.

999
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:14,543
But the responsibility of the drugs that the
police captured are yours and these people.

1000
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:18,550
Due to that you will have lie
in prison for your whole life.

1001
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:22,012
Now you can never
go out from here.

1002
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,125
The home minister is
sitting here. Ask him.

1003
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:29,890
Look gentlemen, between you,
you have a lot of problems l know that.

1004
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,396
This is not the time

1005
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,363
There is only three more days
time for election.

1006
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,596
What l have lost is 100 crore rupees.

1007
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:40,832
There should be an answer to that.

1008
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:44,678
Your casino.

1009
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:46,637
The other properties.

1010
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:52,343
The property rights that you and
your friends have in China town.

1011
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:56,247
l want all that.

1012
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:00,856
Everything.

1013
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:06,695
lf you write all that and give it to
Mr. Gawda you all can go.

1014
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:07,926
Today itself.

1015
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:11,429
There won't be any case on your name.

1016
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:13,938
l give you my word.

1017
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:24,417
Now no one should come here
saying my father's property.

1018
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,177
Sign it.

1019
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:27,446
Sign it.

1020
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:45,029


1021
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,707
That home minister is afraid.

1022
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:55,339
Or else even your dead body
would have come out.

1023
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,415
There are only three days for election.

1024
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:00,281
Till then l won't do anything.
A good boy.

1025
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:03,150
l will obey everything that
the home minister says.

1026
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:08,819
ln these three days you go
anywhere you want. Go.

1027
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:17,497
However far,
you can go even out of lndia.

1028
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,732
But l will search you all
and kill you.

1029
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,039
All of you.

1030
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:26,877
Gawda.

1031
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:29,812
we will settle the scores
between us only between us.

1032
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,610
Leave them out of it.

1033
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:38,749
Didn't you wait for 25 years
to seek revenge from me?

1034
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:43,059
Now in future no one should
come like this.

1035
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,424
No one should be left alive.

1036
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,737
Three days.

1037
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:52,600
That is all the time you have to live.

1038
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:12,019
We have lost everything.
Now none of you stay here.

1039
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:15,094
lf you do all the old things
will happen again.

1040
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:21,062
When l came back here.
l had two aims.

1041
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:24,127
To do something for you people.

1042
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:28,070
Then seek revenge for
the life of my friends.

1043
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:49,588
There is only one king for this China town.
That is me Gawda

1044
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:55,634
Victory to our Gawdaji.
Victory to our Gawdaji.

1045
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,930
Victory to our Gawdaji.
Victory to our Gawdaji.

1046
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,800
Don't be afraid, it is fire-crackers.

1047
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:04,741
Vote for Gawdaji.
Vote for Gawdaji.

1048
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:09,542
Victory to our Gawdaji.
Victory to our Gawdaji

1049
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:11,480
Victory to our Gawdaji.
Victory to our Gawdaji

1050
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:22,659
Vote for Gawdaji.
Vote for Gawdaji.

1051
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:24,855
You gave me three days time, isn't it?

1052
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:28,058
Before that your empire will end.

1053
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:30,261
How ever big that is.

1054
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:33,438
This is not a garland.

1055
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:36,371
This is a wreath that l placed
on your dead body.

1056
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,868
This is the soil in which my father died.

1057
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:07,736
He had seven stab wounds.

1058
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:11,677
Not a person who was just stabbed.

1059
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:16,249
He gave his life for his friends and died.

1060
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,112
That is how l see my father.

1061
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,311
lf my blood also falls in the soil where
my father's blood fell then let it fall.

1062
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:24,822
Mathukutty, what you say is all okay.
But what can we do?

1063
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:28,894
Now itself the three days time that
he gave us has become two.

1064
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:31,725
Police and underworld all are
in his hands, isn't it?

1065
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:39,203
Yes, Mathukutty little time and they are many
people we are only three, what can we do?

1066
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:42,638
We will go and ask forgiveness from him
and go from here and save ourselves.

1067
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:45,039
Hey, he is the one who killed
our mother and father.

1068
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,009
And you say we go and ask
for forgiveness from him?

1069
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:51,140
Death is only once.
Let us die bravely.

1070
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:53,286
That too in this soil
where we were born.

1071
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,286
There is brake.

1072
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,456
Brother, where all l searched for you,
but l should find you, isn't it?

1073
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:08,067
Why do you look for us?

1074
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,735
l didn't search,
that Gawda's men searched.

1075
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:12,630
Don't worry.

1076
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,742
l have brought the things
that will clear your tensions.

1077
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,741
Things?
- Yes.

1078
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,073
Here is country brandy.
- Liquor?

1079
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:21,009
Called that also.

1080
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:25,550
lf you have this then you won't feel
some blows from Gawda

1081
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:27,482
This Goa fenny. Very strong.

1082
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:30,283
lf you have a couple then even if Gawda
shoots also you won't know.

1083
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:31,254
Then give it to me.

1084
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,393
Then there are a lot of items.

1085
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:35,620
Here these are the things.

1086
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:38,765
lf you have this then even if
Gawda cuts off your head..

1087
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,401
..the head will lie far
and laugh at you.

1088
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:43,366
Anyway l am going to have.
Not due to fear.

1089
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:45,664
Fenny is enough for me.
Mathukutty, l am going to have this.

1090
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:48,035
l will have three or four
and due to fear only.

1091
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:49,210
Everything is going to be finished.

1092
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,502
Mathukutty, go ahead. Have one.

1093
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,111
He brought it like a God for us.

1094
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:53,780
l have stopped drinking.

1095
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,610
We will have one each now itself.

1096
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:57,978
Okay pour any one for me.

1097
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,844
Before we die,
this is a party from me.

1098
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:06,785
Here it is Gawda who will decide
who will die and when.

1099
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:11,295
When Mathukutty face to face told him that
he will place a wreath on his chest.

1100
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:17,460
l felt as if a saviour has come to save
China town from Gawda's clutches.

1101
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:20,469
Stopped, isn't it?
- Some more.

1102
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:25,610
What ever you all decide l and
my boys will stand with you all.

1103
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:26,711
Hey, you have children too?

1104
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:28,883
My ruffian boys who fight.

1105
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,072
Then another thing too.

1106
01:26:30,285 --> 01:26:34,483
Now if you are willing to sell the casino
then l have people with me to buy it.

1107
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:35,519
How is that?

1108
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:38,954
Now if you are willing to sell the casino
then l have people with me to buy it.

1109
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,559
How is that?

1110
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:45,324
Now if you are willing to sell the casino
then l have people with me to buy it.

1111
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:46,090
How is that you said?

1112
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:47,290
Hey, tell him, man

1113
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,663
l am not coming from a mental hospital.

1114
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:53,107
lf you have the man..
- l have.

1115
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:54,502
We will think about it.

1116
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,870
But Mathukutty we have signed
the stamp papers, isn't it?

1117
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,409
l will make all that alright.

1118
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:01,173
ls the man genuine?
- No. No. No. He is foreign.

1119
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:02,747
Then call him.

1120
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:05,543
Dupli tica.. tica
- What?

1121
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:08,551
lf you are going to sell with
spurious documents then

1122
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:10,519
l have a problem in joining it.

1123
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:12,192
Here hold it.

1124
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:17,330
Now here lick it lightly..
- What is this?

1125
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:20,262
Now tell me after ten minutes
there is a match or not.

1126
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:21,662
Give me.

1127
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:22,665
One person has agreed.

1128
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:24,428
Have a lick. Give one lick for me too.

1129
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,937
Now who has come?

1130
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,877
The girl who speaks Malayalam
like English.

1131
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:36,080
Along with her,
even star singers are there?

1132
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:41,951
One minute, l will just look and come.

1133
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:45,824
Hey, you frightened me.

1134
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:46,618
Should you be afraid?

1135
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,490
You shout more than this before
people to frighten them.

1136
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:52,666
You don't know me.

1137
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:54,461
l am CV Chandran Valanjavan.

1138
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:55,931
Nice to meet you.
- Same to you.

1139
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:58,503
Wait. l am the underwear of this..

1140
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:00,230
The don of the underworld.

1141
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:00,907
Oh!

1142
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,100
The boys standing there are
my gang members.

1143
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:04,175
ls that all? Then okay.

1144
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:05,403
One minute.

1145
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,241
ln this program till which round
should l reach to embrace you?

1146
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:09,177
You want to know that, isn't it?
Yes.

1147
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:10,112
Now l will show you.

1148
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:12,218
Guys...

1149
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,920
Stop. What is this danger zone?
- Yes.

1150
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,286
Hey, l got eliminated.

1151
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:55,519


1152
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:10,672
" Who is company?
Honest company?"

1153
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:16,515
" ln the middle of war,
the enemy is company."

1154
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:22,680
" Who is company?
Honest company?"

1155
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:29,625
" ln the middle of war,
the enemy is company."

1156
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:41,400
" When you get trouble in life.."

1157
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:43,736
" The juice of grapes
is good company."

1158
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:46,072
" Even when you get drunk
with the grape juice.."

1159
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,338
..aren't we a good company?

1160
01:29:50,618 --> 01:30:00,584


1161
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:14,908
" The woman is company
of a man always."

1162
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:19,671
" The dreams are always
the company of wishes."

1163
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:24,341
" Love is always the company of love."

1164
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:28,682
" All the life there is company
that walks hand in hand."

1165
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:33,020
" Who is company? Honest company?"

1166
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:42,526
" ln the middle of war,
the enemy is company.

1167
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:29,741
" When you get trouble in life.."

1168
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:34,251
" The juice of grapes is good company."
aren't we a good company?

1169
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:43,420
" Even when you get drunk with the
grape juice.. aren't we a good company?

1170
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:48,065
''We are a good and close company''

1171
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:57,334
" ln the middle of war,
the enemy is company.

1172
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:07,114
''We are agreat company...''

1173
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:12,623

To grow a moustache like this,
do you have a license?

1192
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:05,832
How you grew that moustache?

1193
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:10,100

To cut his moustache.

1200

Where ever we are that is our place.

1210
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:11,900
lf we tell you, you won't understand.

1211
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:13,300
Hey, don't talk.

1212
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:16,908
Hey, you go from here to there,
isn't it wrong?

1213
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:18,009
What happened?

1214
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:22,672
Have you taken drinks?
- Did l drink? Did you drink?

1215
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:23,713
Little.

1216
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:26,079
l just had a little. No problem.

1217
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:28,046
She kept the phone down.

1218
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,186
Hello. Hello. Hello.

1219
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:31,517
Dear, Rosamma

1220
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,353
What happened?

1221
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,461
Looks like Mathukutty is drunk, Uncle.

1222
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:36,721
ls that such a big thing?

1223
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:38,057
He much have had
a couple of drinks.

1224
01:35:38,265 --> 01:35:39,391
Don't make that a big issue.

1225
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,296
Hey, it is not that.
lf he drinks it is a big mess.

1226
01:35:42,503 --> 01:35:44,232
He can't be controlled by any one.

1227
01:35:44,438 --> 01:35:46,531
l don't know what will happen.

1228
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:49,375
That is why l took him
to the meditation centre.

1229
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:53,570
Specially in this situation
if he drinks also..

1230
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:56,079
Don't worry, dear.
He is not alone, isn't it?

1231
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:59,775
There is Zakharia and
Binoy to control him.

1232
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:03,286
Hey, don't vomit.

1233
01:36:03,524 --> 01:36:06,220
lf there is a gap to insert a finger
l will have a couple more too.

1234
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:09,293
His mother's ..
- Hey..

1235
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:13,297
Should we leave that Gawda
who killed our parents?

1236
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:17,232
Just like he vomited we should
beat him and make him bleed.

1237
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:18,969
Then make a promise.
- Promise.

1238
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:20,105
You?
- Yes we should take revenge.

1239
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:21,331
Promise. Promise.

1240
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:25,308
Promise. Promise. Promise.

1241
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:40,984


1242
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:44,787
Which is this place?

1243
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:11,113
Who is he?

1244
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:14,459
Hey, he is not my man.

1245
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:17,788
Who is it?

1246
01:37:18,199 --> 01:37:19,632
Pull the leg.

1247
01:37:20,401 --> 01:37:21,732
Leg. Leg.

1248
01:37:23,003 --> 01:37:26,769
Not my leg. His leg. Remove it.

1249
01:37:32,746 --> 01:37:35,408
Then his trunk. Trunk.

1250
01:37:38,385 --> 01:37:39,647
Pull me.

1251
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:46,825
Hey he is looking for me.
- You come here.

1252
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:51,991
Who is that man?

1253
01:37:52,433 --> 01:37:54,230
Which is this place?
Are we in Japan?

1254
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:56,596
Wasn't it you got us here?

1255
01:37:56,804 --> 01:37:59,034
Me? This me?

1256
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,104
Yes, you.

1257
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:01,740
This is the first time l am
seeing this place.

1258
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:04,467
Hey, wasn't it you who booked
a room for us here?

1259
01:38:04,678 --> 01:38:09,172
You said you wanted to some process and
went l didn't know when you returned too.

1260
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:10,975
No, l am not able to remember anything.

1261
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:13,853
Hey, don't say all that please.

1262
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:18,753
You said you will execute all sale
procedures and we all strongly trust you.

1263
01:38:41,815 --> 01:38:43,680
Need more on my buttocks?

1264
01:38:45,319 --> 01:38:46,343
Actually what happened?

1265
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:47,679

1266
01:38:47,888 --> 01:38:50,152
Yesterday.. don't remember anything.

1267
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:51,289
Do you remember anything?

1268
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:55,121
No. Yesterday we had a few drinks.

1269
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:56,318
What did you have?

1270
01:38:56,530 --> 01:39:03,231
Brandy, whisky, vodka, gin,
rum, beer, a little wine.

1271
01:39:03,437 --> 01:39:05,769
Then a little fenny, then some wine,
then some liquor.

1272
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:07,372
When you had all this
did you feel any difficulty?

1273
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:09,235
Of course how bad we felt
when the fenny was over.

1274
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:11,468
Then when we got the liquor
then we felt better.

1275
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,705
Embrace my..

1276
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:16,249
Did he have anything else?

1277
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:18,714
Then a powder in China town. This one.

1278
01:39:18,919 --> 01:39:20,386
Doctor, tell me, what this is.

1279
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:23,613
Oh my God, you should not have this.

1280
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:26,816
Now we only mixed it and drank it.

1281
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:29,989
Do you know how dangerous that is?

1282
01:39:30,197 --> 01:39:32,563
lf you have it, you won't remember
for two or three days.

1283
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:34,559
Some people may even
become mad.

1284
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:38,397
Now he is there.
We can't say how he will act.

1285
01:39:38,906 --> 01:39:41,397
May l come in?- Yes.

1286
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:46,044
He has something to tell the doctor.
- Yes.

1287
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:50,439
Hey, call the ambulance.

1288
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:53,279
We are in a hospital
then why an ambulance?

1289
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:54,920
Hey, bring him out.

1290
01:39:56,156 --> 01:39:59,489
Now what do we do with him?

1291
01:39:59,693 --> 01:40:03,595
Hey, come here. Not there.

1292
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:06,260

Hey, don't do that.

1296
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:16,437

Then you stand here, we are running.

Hey, your man is there.
There. You come here snake.

1314
01:41:12,099 --> 01:41:15,125
lf l think of giving some help

1315
01:41:15,235 --> 01:41:17,260
Why is that tsunami coming

You must thank him.

My heart is not a temple,

He is looking at us.

1480
01:49:19,419 --> 01:49:21,887
Not me. We drank and did
this without knowing.

1481
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:24,579
Even without drinks,
we would have done the same.

That is all there.

1496
01:50:17,143 --> 01:50:19,111
He only will come in person and say that.

1497
01:50:20,246 --> 01:50:23,147

Just asking like that.

1521
01:51:33,887 --> 01:51:37,789
lf per chance the documents
don't come then?

1522
01:51:39,926 --> 01:51:41,018
Hi. You die.

1523
01:51:42,262 --> 01:51:45,698
Now l will call them and
tell them to dig my burial pit.

1524
01:51:56,743 --> 01:51:58,404
See, how you look.

1525
01:51:58,611 --> 01:52:00,442
Hey, got saved.

1526
01:52:00,647 --> 01:52:01,875
No, not got saved.

1527
01:52:05,351 --> 01:52:06,716
Now you come to catch me.

1528
01:52:07,353 --> 01:52:10,117
Come and catch me.

1529
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,221
Where are you? That is right.

1530
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:13,722
So you got stuck?

1531
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:19,826
No documents, no money.
What will you do, you born to a frog?

1532
01:52:20,166 --> 01:52:23,658
l go, you die, okay?

1533
01:52:23,870 --> 01:52:24,837
One second.

1534
01:52:27,841 --> 01:52:29,240
Go, you mad fellow.

1535
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:33,845
Was it over? Hey, no.

1536
01:52:42,155 --> 01:52:45,181
Don't vomit on the ground. ln this. ln this.

1537
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:49,354
Where l am?

1538
01:52:49,629 --> 01:52:52,097
When this is over,
l will join for home nursing.

1539
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:57,061
Hey. No. No. Lie down.

1540
01:52:58,338 --> 01:53:01,205
Mathukutty, now what do we do with him?

1541
01:53:01,508 --> 01:53:03,840
Now that is thinking what it will do with us.

1542
01:53:04,878 --> 01:53:07,278
lf you vomit, l will break your
neck and intestines.

1543
01:53:11,151 --> 01:53:12,675
What did you tell me on the phone?

1544
01:53:12,886 --> 01:53:14,148
To manage that Sumo?

1545
01:53:14,354 --> 01:53:15,286
What you did do so?

1546
01:53:15,488 --> 01:53:17,888
lf you would have said to drink all
the water of the Arabian ocean..

1547
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:22,026
..l would have done so. l escaped
because he wasn't dressed up.

1548
01:53:22,228 --> 01:53:25,356
Once he has tied the tyres etc
it is like the Sardarjis..

1549
01:53:25,565 --> 01:53:27,430
..removing the Kirpan.

1550
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:29,226
They won't keep it back
without blood on it.

1551
01:53:29,435 --> 01:53:30,299
And you got me into it.

1552
01:53:30,503 --> 01:53:32,733
Someone has to go again.

1553
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:34,531
Surely that is a very good thing to do.

1554
01:53:34,741 --> 01:53:36,299
l know. Who is going?
- You.

1555
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:38,236
Me?

1556
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:42,437
Then you have decided that
l will be sacrificed, isn't it?

1557
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:44,480
Silence.

1558
01:53:45,785 --> 01:53:47,309
Just answer in one word.

1559
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,680
Who will go?

1560
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:51,322
l will go,
- To where?

1561
01:53:52,458 --> 01:53:52,981
Relax.

1562
01:53:53,193 --> 01:53:55,718
Okay. Okay now don't sit to argue.

1563
01:53:55,929 --> 01:53:57,897
Yes. You should go.

1564
01:54:00,099 --> 01:54:01,430
Now shall l tell you one truth?

1565
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:02,927
What?
- l will tell.

1566
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,831
Then tell.

1567
01:54:05,038 --> 01:54:08,371
l am mad. l don't remember anything.

1568
01:54:08,908 --> 01:54:11,536
But he remembers you very well.

1569
01:54:13,413 --> 01:54:14,641
Then?

1570
01:54:16,082 --> 01:54:17,606
You will have to give a small party.

1571
01:54:17,817 --> 01:54:18,476
Why?

1572
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:21,882
Without any one of us knowing
an engagement took place secretly.

1573
01:54:22,488 --> 01:54:23,819
This is the bride to be.

1574
01:54:24,357 --> 01:54:25,483
The groom is suspense.

1575
01:54:25,925 --> 01:54:29,554
Not that much of suspense.
He is the son of Uncle's friend.

1576
01:54:29,762 --> 01:54:30,888
Oh l see.

1577
01:54:31,097 --> 01:54:33,497
Then things like this happened
without my knowledge too?

1578
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:35,327
Okay if you don't tell me then don't .

1579
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:40,063
Who ever is that thief
l will make him say that to all.

1580
01:54:42,108 --> 01:54:46,169
You are in queue.
All lines in this route are busy.

1581
01:54:51,351 --> 01:54:54,650
Hello. Yes.
- What?

1582
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:57,182
All three of us?
- What is it?

1583
01:54:57,523 --> 01:54:58,547
Okay Uncle.

1584
01:54:59,626 --> 01:55:01,184
What?
- Nothing.

1585
01:55:01,394 --> 01:55:02,258
What?
- Nothing.

1586
01:55:02,462 --> 01:55:03,724
Something is there.

1587
01:55:04,163 --> 01:55:05,494
Uncle wants us three to go home.

1588
01:55:05,698 --> 01:55:09,998
What for? One of us three has
got married. Uncle says that.

1589
01:55:10,203 --> 01:55:11,670
When.
- Last night

1590
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:15,932
Why?
- l don't know anything. Hey. Come here.

1591
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:19,503
Really l didn't marry any one.
l know how to marry.

1592
01:55:19,712 --> 01:55:20,838
You take care of him.
- Why?

1593
01:55:21,047 --> 01:55:22,674
We have to go to a place.
Take care of him till we come back.

1594
01:55:22,882 --> 01:55:24,179
l have to two places.

1595
01:55:24,817 --> 01:55:28,913
He remembers you. He remembers you.
He remembers you. That is all.

1596
01:55:30,223 --> 01:55:32,020
You must see to all his needs.
- Not me.

1597
01:55:32,225 --> 01:55:36,184
He remembers you.
- You remember, isn't it?

1598
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:39,861
l don't remember anything.
- Hey, why you are like this?

1599
01:55:40,833 --> 01:55:42,528
Hey, take him away..
- l am going.

1600
01:55:42,735 --> 01:55:43,702
Go man.

1601
01:55:45,405 --> 01:55:47,873
Didn't you hear him call?
Take him to the toilet.

1602
01:56:02,188 --> 01:56:12,154


1603
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:27,673
" This is a happy day for a girl."
"A day in which a girl's heart is joyful."

1604
01:56:28,114 --> 01:56:31,015
" A day when we all get together."

1605
01:56:31,384 --> 01:56:35,013
" A day where flowers are
strewn with happiness."

1606
01:56:35,221 --> 01:56:38,190
" A girl who needs to sing
and dance happily."

1607
01:56:38,391 --> 01:56:44,023
" A day on which all celebrate grandly."

1608
01:56:44,230 --> 01:56:50,692
" A day for happiness."
"When the heart is full ofjoy."

1609
01:56:50,903 --> 01:56:57,536
" A day for happiness."
"When the heart is full ofjoy."

1610
01:56:58,244 --> 01:57:04,547
" This is a happy day for a girl."
"A day in which a girl's heart is joyful."

1611
01:57:04,917 --> 01:57:07,784
" A day when we all get together."

1612
01:57:08,254 --> 01:57:12,156
" A day where flowers are
strewn with happiness."

1613
01:57:22,268 --> 01:57:32,234


1614
01:57:39,619 --> 01:57:45,819
" At the time when the heart dances."
"When the girl longs for his company."

1615
01:57:46,392 --> 01:57:52,262
" The bride wears the jewelry of shyness."
"The cloud that floats in the wind."

1616
01:57:52,465 --> 01:57:58,426
" Soothing winds that give happiness."

1617
01:57:59,138 --> 01:58:02,767
" Both have made the
love flower bloom in me."

1618
01:58:02,975 --> 01:58:05,603
" A sweet dream in which
love brings joy."

1619
01:58:05,812 --> 01:58:12,115
" A day that is joyful gets
embedded in memory."

1620
01:58:12,318 --> 01:58:21,454
" lt strews happiness like
the pollen of flowers."

1621
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:35,569
" The feet tap in tune of a dance."

1622
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:42,145
" This is a happy day for a girl."
"A day in which a girl's heart is joyful."

1623
01:58:42,515 --> 01:58:45,484
" A day when we all get together."

1624
01:58:45,852 --> 01:58:49,913
" A day where flowers are
strewn with happiness."

1625
01:59:02,368 --> 01:59:12,334


1626
01:59:16,382 --> 01:59:19,510
" The heart sees dreams."
"And beautifies oneself."

1627
01:59:19,719 --> 01:59:23,018
" Oh the cloud that flitters
with happiness."

1628
01:59:23,289 --> 01:59:29,853
" This is the time when.."
"When the heart feels the love."

1629
01:59:30,062 --> 01:59:36,695
" This is the time when.."
"When the heart feels the love."

1630
01:59:39,238 --> 01:59:43,436
Stop. Stop.
- A decision for everything has come.

1631
01:59:46,078 --> 01:59:51,482
My God. Give me chance to escape.
Won't allow.

1632
01:59:51,684 --> 01:59:53,549
Where are you all going with this?
- Marriage.

1633
01:59:53,753 --> 01:59:54,219
What?

1634
01:59:54,921 --> 01:59:57,549
We were to go for a marriage
- we are late for the time of marriage.

1635
01:59:58,758 --> 01:59:59,816
What is in the sack?

1636
02:00:00,026 --> 02:00:02,494
Bananas.
- Coconuts.

1637
02:00:02,862 --> 02:00:05,660
Tell the truth, what is in it?
- Homeo..

1638
02:00:05,865 --> 02:00:09,062
Homeopathy medicines.
- One sackful?

1639
02:00:09,268 --> 02:00:12,066
lt was in two sacks we
made it in one sack.

1640
02:00:12,271 --> 02:00:15,399
Open it, man.
- Not your top. The sack.

1641
02:00:15,608 --> 02:00:18,736
Do it fast.
We got in the car on the way.

1642
02:00:18,945 --> 02:00:23,905
Though got in on the way,
- we are going together, isn't it?

1643
02:00:24,116 --> 02:00:25,583
That l will take care. You open.

1644
02:00:25,885 --> 02:00:29,252
l am going to open.
Pray that the knot doesn't open.

1645
02:00:29,455 --> 02:00:30,080
Hello.

1646
02:00:31,023 --> 02:00:33,617
What? Home minister is missing?

1647
02:00:37,463 --> 02:00:38,259
Don't .

1648
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:42,594
Come on, get in the car and drive fast.

1649
02:00:43,469 --> 02:00:53,435


1650
02:00:55,314 --> 02:00:57,942
Oh, we got saved.
Now we have to be very careful.

1651
02:00:58,150 --> 02:01:00,448
The police have spread
the net in the whole state.

1652
02:01:00,653 --> 02:01:01,620
Hey, minister is missing.

1653
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:04,449
The home minister is missing again.
There he is going.

1654
02:01:05,825 --> 02:01:09,625
Catch him.
Hey, don't beat him.

1655
02:01:11,163 --> 02:01:13,461
Why did you beat that poor fellow?
- Why did you do so?

1656
02:01:13,666 --> 02:01:15,133
l can do so, he is my father-in-law.

1657
02:01:15,334 --> 02:01:18,303
l also beat your father-in-law.
No one come to ask me.

1658
02:01:30,082 --> 02:01:31,140
What happened?

1659
02:01:31,417 --> 02:01:32,543
What will happen?

1660
02:01:32,752 --> 02:01:35,983
l went to many places and searched.
Can't find the money nor the documents.

1661
02:01:36,455 --> 02:01:38,650
Mathukutty is also looking in two places.

1662
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:42,989
Then Mathukutty may be
purposely doing this.

1663
02:01:43,195 --> 02:01:44,992
Hey, he won't do like that.

1664
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:48,165
When it comes to the question of money
we can't trust any one Binoy.

1665
02:01:48,367 --> 02:01:50,164
We can't say like that.

1666
02:01:50,469 --> 02:01:52,164
Leave that. What happened here?

1667
02:01:53,105 --> 02:01:54,595
What will happen here?

1668
02:01:54,874 --> 02:01:58,674
He was taken four times
to the toilet. Washed him.

1669
02:01:59,378 --> 02:02:02,006
He is my future father-in-law, isn't it?
Have to do it, isn't it?

1670
02:02:02,615 --> 02:02:07,177
Future. Death is just behind us,
it can catch us at any time.

1671
02:02:07,386 --> 02:02:10,685
lf l say one thing Zakharia
shouldn't fight with me.

1672
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:15,850
What if we tell him that we made
a mistake, ask for pardon?

1673
02:02:16,228 --> 02:02:18,355
Hey, Binoy don't do so.
- Don't say so.

1674
02:02:18,564 --> 02:02:20,031
What if he doesn't agree then?

1675
02:02:20,232 --> 02:02:21,358
lf he doesn't agree
then we will again beat him..

1676
02:02:21,567 --> 02:02:24,536
..on the head and make him
unconscious. lsn't that okay?

1677
02:02:25,571 --> 02:02:26,037
Come.

1678
02:02:28,574 --> 02:02:30,474
Uncle. Sir.

1679
02:02:33,913 --> 02:02:35,278
l have a few things to tell.

1680
02:02:35,481 --> 02:02:37,108
What?
- ls it important?

1681
02:02:37,316 --> 02:02:38,783
How long you can keep me here like this?

1682
02:02:38,984 --> 02:02:41,544
Do you guys think that you
can escape from this?

1683
02:02:43,422 --> 02:02:46,858
Never. You can never escape from this.

1684
02:02:47,426 --> 02:02:50,520
But one of you can escape.

1685
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:57,797
All the blame will come on your head
in the end. One of you is a betrayer.

1686
02:02:59,338 --> 02:03:02,739
Because he is acting that
he doesn't remember anything.

1687
02:03:03,142 --> 02:03:06,373
He has all the documents
and money in his hands.

1688
02:03:13,586 --> 02:03:19,889
Hey, he woke up.
- Binoy, where is Chandni?

1689
02:03:20,092 --> 02:03:22,060
We have kept her in the rest room.

1690
02:03:22,261 --> 02:03:27,221
Now no more talking
Take her and reach her safely to her home.

1691
02:03:27,433 --> 02:03:29,731
lf so then Chandni can go with sir, isn't it?

1692
02:03:29,935 --> 02:03:32,403
Hey, we have kidnapped him, isn't it?

1693
02:03:32,605 --> 02:03:35,233
Yes, sir, do you know who he is?

1694
02:03:35,441 --> 02:03:39,138
Your future son-in-law.
- l love you, papa.

1695
02:03:44,383 --> 02:03:45,907
l kissed her father.

1696
02:03:46,118 --> 02:03:48,916
l need a bag to safely send
the documents.

1697
02:03:50,289 --> 02:03:52,416
Then go and get a bag to carry everywhere.

1698
02:03:52,792 --> 02:03:55,090
Let me see how many feet.

1699
02:03:55,294 --> 02:04:01,096
One, two, three.
No three into three, six feet.

1700
02:04:01,467 --> 02:04:05,198
Hey, get his phone.
Get his phone.

1701
02:04:05,471 --> 02:04:06,768
Sir, where is your phone?

1702
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:10,438
Take his phone and
speak in his tone and call the lG.

1703
02:04:10,643 --> 02:04:15,444
DlG, Police, call all of them and
ask them to raid all of Gawda's places.

1704
02:04:15,648 --> 02:04:16,615
But no range here.

1705
02:04:16,816 --> 02:04:18,545
Then go to the place which has range.

1706
02:04:19,985 --> 02:04:22,681
Hello, now tell me what l should do?

1707
02:04:25,324 --> 02:04:27,451
That is possible only after a while.

1708
02:04:32,698 --> 02:04:38,659
Hey, Rosamma, everything is okay.
Our money.

1709
02:04:48,714 --> 02:04:51,205
The girl whom you love is his wife now.

1710
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:56,451
Can't believe it, isn't it?

1711
02:04:56,822 --> 02:05:02,021
Go. Go and enquire. Before your dear
friend gets you down in the betrayal pit.

1712
02:05:02,228 --> 02:05:05,129
This is your last chance to save yourself.

1713
02:05:18,744 --> 02:05:26,378
Tell the truth, the one who put this ring
on your finger was Mathukutty?

1714
02:05:31,957 --> 02:05:32,924
Yes.

1715
02:05:46,205 --> 02:05:49,902
Mathukutty. How can Mathukutty
do like this?

1716
02:05:50,276 --> 02:05:54,406
l am not able to believe this.
- Don't believe it, man.

1717
02:05:54,613 --> 02:05:56,410
Don't believe in any one.

1718
02:05:57,283 --> 02:06:00,582
What l thought among the group,
l am the greatest fraud.

1719
02:06:00,786 --> 02:06:06,918
We are nothing, Binoy. She and
her Mathukutty are the big people.

1720
02:06:08,027 --> 02:06:11,588
Now all the bad names are for us
and money and all comforts for them.

1721
02:06:12,665 --> 02:06:16,761
Mathukutty won't do like that.
He did all that without any memory.

1722
02:06:19,138 --> 02:06:20,196
Don't talk.

1723
02:06:27,813 --> 02:06:37,779


1724
02:06:40,259 --> 02:06:43,456
Only he doesn't remember anything.

1725
02:06:43,729 --> 02:06:46,357
Hiding the money, taking the documents.

1726
02:06:46,732 --> 02:06:48,029
He doesn't remember anything.

1727
02:06:48,334 --> 02:06:51,360
Why more? He doesn't even
remember he married you.

1728
02:06:56,675 --> 02:06:58,973
Now you or him shouldn't forget anything.

1729
02:06:59,178 --> 02:07:02,306
This is for not forgetting like that.
- Zakharia.

1730
02:07:02,514 --> 02:07:02,980
No.

1731
02:07:04,516 --> 02:07:08,145
Don't think that you will make a fool
of every one & you will take everything and go.

1732
02:07:08,354 --> 02:07:10,481
As of today all the games will be over.
l will end it all.

1733
02:07:10,689 --> 02:07:12,657
Now what ever it is say it clearly.
l am not able to understand anything.

1734
02:07:12,858 --> 02:07:16,817
l will explain. l will call Chandni
then tell her where her daddy is.

1735
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,155
As Uncle wanted we could
not stand together.

1736
02:07:20,366 --> 02:07:24,325
But we can end it all together,
- Don't talk like that. Hey..

1737
02:07:25,971 --> 02:07:29,236
Once we listened to what ever you said.
That is enough.

1738
02:07:29,708 --> 02:07:34,839
Now we will do.
Just be with us. Call man.

1739
02:07:36,382 --> 02:07:40,341
Binoy, don't call.
- No, don't do so.

1740
02:07:55,601 --> 02:07:58,297
Listen to what say, don't get
every one killed.

1741
02:08:12,651 --> 02:08:17,520
No. Now you go your way
and we will go ours.

1742
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:20,358
No problem between us.
Come, Rosamma

1743
02:08:21,326 --> 02:08:25,023
Hey, you put us all on the highway,
you will go your way, isn't it?

1744
02:08:25,631 --> 02:08:26,359
Don't do it.

1745
02:08:55,294 --> 02:09:00,254
Don't do it. Stop it all.

1746
02:09:01,233 --> 02:09:04,930
Mathukutty, don't do it. Stop it, leave him.

1747
02:09:05,304 --> 02:09:05,929
Stop it.

1748
02:09:08,373 --> 02:09:11,934
don't do it. Stop it, leave him.

1749
02:09:12,244 --> 02:09:13,108
Stop it.

1750
02:09:17,983 --> 02:09:21,612
Uncle, they have some problem.
Ask them what it is.

1751
02:09:25,157 --> 02:09:30,117
Since you're my Xavier's son l can't.
Or else l would have killed you.

1752
02:09:31,997 --> 02:09:35,125
You want everything alone isn't it?
Take it. Take everything.

1753
02:09:35,334 --> 02:09:36,858
No one will stop you.

1754
02:09:37,803 --> 02:09:38,701
Uncle, don't talk without knowing anything.

1755
02:09:38,904 --> 02:09:44,638
Go from here. You also.
Come on out.

1756
02:09:45,177 --> 02:09:46,144
Get out.

1757
02:10:04,797 --> 02:10:06,264
What?
- Binoy

1758
02:10:33,058 --> 02:10:43,024


1759
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:58,480
All are called here to tell you all
about a very important thing.

1760
02:10:59,284 --> 02:11:03,152
All things about us we have
told him and convinced him.

1761
02:11:03,689 --> 02:11:06,214
And he has agreed to protect us also.

1762
02:11:06,592 --> 02:11:13,156
Her father's need too is to escape
from the clutches of Gawda.

1763
02:11:13,365 --> 02:11:19,167
His decision is to make people believe
that Gawda and his men have kidnapped him.

1764
02:11:19,371 --> 02:11:23,273
For that he needs our help.

1765
02:11:23,475 --> 02:11:25,943
Dad told all three of you to go to him.

1766
02:11:26,144 --> 02:11:29,341
l won't. l won't come for any
such thing henceforth.

1767
02:11:30,682 --> 02:11:32,343
Especially with him.

1768
02:11:32,918 --> 02:11:38,015
Don't . Don't come with me.
l will go to your daddy. Come.

1769
02:11:40,058 --> 02:11:42,583
Let Rosamma be here. Please.

1770
02:11:47,232 --> 02:11:52,465
Zakharia just as you think she
and Mathukutty didn't betray you.

1771
02:12:02,748 --> 02:12:06,047
Rosamma, Rosamma, home minister.

1772
02:12:06,852 --> 02:12:08,979
Hey, what are you doing, dear?
- Everything is okay.

1773
02:12:09,187 --> 02:12:12,384
We sold our casino.
We have money with us.

1774
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:14,559
Tonight itself you and
Zakharia will marry.

1775
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:16,728
Here, l even brought the ring.

1776
02:12:17,729 --> 02:12:18,889
You go home and get ready and come.

1777
02:12:19,097 --> 02:12:22,066
l will get you married
then everything is okay

1778
02:12:22,434 --> 02:12:26,063
Dear.
- What?

1779
02:12:27,005 --> 02:12:30,304
l don't want this marriage.
- Why so?

1780
02:12:31,109 --> 02:12:32,906
l don't want marriage at all.

1781
02:12:33,211 --> 02:12:35,611
Since you didn't marry my brother?

1782
02:12:37,382 --> 02:12:41,250
Your brother didn't marry me
because of my say so.

1783
02:12:41,453 --> 02:12:44,854
Why was that?
- l can't marry any one else.

1784
02:12:45,057 --> 02:12:49,687
What did you say?
- l want to marry you only.

1785
02:12:50,295 --> 02:12:53,753
Why didn't you tell me before?
- l was afraid.

1786
02:12:54,232 --> 02:13:01,661
Rosamma look here.
Why did you hide it all for so long?

1787
02:13:01,873 --> 02:13:06,276
What wish of yours l didn't fulfill?

1788
02:13:09,815 --> 02:13:14,115
Come. Normally in our religion
we marry before saints.

1789
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:16,446
This is the first time
we got married before a devil.

1790
02:13:16,655 --> 02:13:19,123
Hey, my don goggles.

1791
02:13:19,324 --> 02:13:23,283
We got married.
We sold the casino.

1792
02:13:23,595 --> 02:13:26,120
Got the documents.
Got five crores too.

1793
02:13:26,331 --> 02:13:28,629
We all are going to marry
and live comfortably.

1794
02:13:28,834 --> 02:13:30,131
You go and tell that Gawda.

1795
02:13:33,438 --> 02:13:36,703
Later when Mathukutty said
he didn't remember anything..

1796
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:45,639
..l simply couldn't believe it.
Except that l did not betray any one.

1797
02:14:25,023 --> 02:14:25,682
Hello.

1798
02:14:27,092 --> 02:14:30,926
Will you all escape after
killing the home minister?

1799
02:14:35,534 --> 02:14:36,501
Now what to do?

1800
02:14:36,701 --> 02:14:39,829
The home minister is fated
to die at my hands.

1801
02:14:40,038 --> 02:14:43,997
But the credit for all that is on all of you.

1802
02:14:44,209 --> 02:14:48,737
Now l can kill you on the road
like they do of street dogs.

1803
02:14:48,947 --> 02:14:52,246
Before l become a minister,
a small heroism.

1804
02:14:52,984 --> 02:14:57,011
Three days are over,
and with it your lives.

1805
02:15:00,492 --> 02:15:02,289
Countdown starts.

1806
02:15:18,710 --> 02:15:20,337
What is this?
- Gawda.

1807
02:15:22,581 --> 02:15:23,878
Why are you all in this disguise?

1808
02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:27,482
One day today you can wear
this disguise and walk anywhere.

1809
02:15:28,487 --> 02:15:31,945
Today is Halloween day.
A big celebration here.

1810
02:15:32,324 --> 02:15:33,723
The day of the dead

1811
02:15:39,998 --> 02:15:45,231
Hi, l am from VTV. The whole Goa
is celebrating Halloween day today.

1812
02:16:00,418 --> 02:16:06,379
The biggest and the best event is
taking place right here in China town.

1813
02:16:06,691 --> 02:16:09,990
We are showing the live telecast
from there.

1814
02:16:15,033 --> 02:16:15,499
Talk.

1815
02:16:15,734 --> 02:16:18,430
Gawda, you need not search
for us and come.

1816
02:16:19,204 --> 02:16:26,667
We will come where you say.
l will come. We all will come.

1817
02:16:28,446 --> 02:16:33,008
That is good. l will have
a little less to do. Thanks.

1818
02:16:33,385 --> 02:16:35,580
Tell me where.

1819
02:16:38,390 --> 02:16:39,186
When?

1820
02:17:28,473 --> 02:17:38,439


1821
02:18:18,523 --> 02:18:25,156
Brave, just like the father.
Goes in search of death.

1822
02:18:25,463 --> 02:18:27,931
That is the problem of being
born to a good father.

1823
02:18:28,366 --> 02:18:30,493
That problem won't happen to you.

1824
02:18:31,202 --> 02:18:33,432
Then l didn't come in search of death.

1825
02:18:34,139 --> 02:18:37,006
Death has come in search of you.

1826
02:18:37,709 --> 02:18:39,404
Good, very good.

1827
02:18:41,046 --> 02:18:43,913
Don't finish him in one stroke.
No fun in that.

1828
02:18:44,649 --> 02:18:52,522
He must cry. Very loudly and
l must hear his cries.

1829
02:18:53,391 --> 02:18:58,419
Come on, boys. Go and kill him.

1830
02:22:57,335 --> 02:22:59,565
Hey put mask

1831
02:26:12,163 --> 02:26:15,291
Hotel now is this only.
l got the key from him.

1832
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:17,525
Who was living?

1833
02:26:20,671 --> 02:26:21,797
Who is this?
- Jaggu.

1834
02:26:22,006 --> 02:26:24,474
You run...
- Jaggubhai.

1835
02:26:27,512 --> 02:26:28,638
Who did this to you?

1836
02:26:28,946 --> 02:26:29,640
You

1837
02:26:31,382 --> 02:26:38,481
l didn't think that l could know
Jaggubhai so quickly.

1838
02:26:38,689 --> 02:26:43,149
l had expected. l knew that a business
of Rs.5crores will be done.

1839
02:26:43,361 --> 02:26:43,918
l came for that.

1840
02:26:44,128 --> 02:26:44,890
Jaggubhai.

1841
02:26:46,197 --> 02:26:48,165
You keep this money here and go.
- Jaggubhai.

1842
02:26:51,269 --> 02:26:54,170
Mathukutty, our five crores and
documents is all in this.

1843
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:57,733
And now what do we have in store today?
Escape from here.

1844
02:27:00,044 --> 02:27:01,102
Don't move.

1845
02:27:01,813 --> 02:27:03,838
Be careful, he is more dangerous
that Gawda.

1846
02:27:04,048 --> 02:27:04,844
Will take care.

1847
02:27:10,555 --> 02:27:12,022
Stop there.
- l will come now.

1848
02:27:12,223 --> 02:27:13,588
This is our Jaggubhai.

1849
02:27:13,825 --> 02:27:16,089
lf l catch him l will get Rs.10 lakhs.

1850
02:27:18,396 --> 02:27:24,062
l will come back to settle accounts
