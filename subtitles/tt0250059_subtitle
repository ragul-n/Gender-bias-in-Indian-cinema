00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,557
(Machinery clanging)

2
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,231
(Man recites a Zoroastrian prayer)

3
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,310
{Female voice-over)
"The vultures swoop earthwards

4
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,637
'to perform their funereal duties.

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,434
'Solemn high priests of Ahura Mazda,

6
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,759
'engendering the purification
of the world.

7
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,360
'No one knows where they come from,

8
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,309
'nor where they go to nest.

9
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,713
'In the Towers of Silence,

10
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,998
the vultures gnaw your soul.

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,717
Your little dog with four eyes

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,198
was made to sniff the face
of your mother

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,433
'and the evil spirit was exorcised.

14
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,398
(Prayer continues)

15
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,554
(Prayer ends)

16
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,431
(Crows cawing)

17
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,714
(Cawing)

18
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,313
(Baby crying)

19
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,358
I'm sorry.

20
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,952
I want you to treat this child
as if he were my own.

21
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,513
It's forbidden to enter.
It's an abandoned Tower of Silence.

22
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,870
Sacred burial ground
of the Zoroastrians.

23
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,195
Is this where corpses are left
to be devoured by vultures?

24
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,559
It's grotesque.

25
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,149
You speak in ignorance.

26
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,239
The vultures are divine ministers
that strip the soul of its flesh.

27
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,193
The skeleton is dried by the sun
and thrown into a well

28
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,994
where it gradually crumbles to dust,

29
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,590
Rich and poor meet
on a level of equality after death.

30
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,390
My mother was laid to rest here.

31
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,597
(Echoing shrieks)

32
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,555
Tell me about your childhood.

33
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,431
I was born here.

34
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,631
My father was in the army.

35
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,713
He was a Muslim.

36
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,555
My mother was
from a Zoroastrian family.

37
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,510
They fell in love.
It was quite a scandal.

38
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,520
Zoroastrians don't tolerate marriage
outside their own community.

39
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,834
A few years after I was born,

40
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,316
they divorced
and she went back to her parents.

41
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,191
She died when I was five.

42
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,877
After that, I went to live
with my father for a while.

43
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,159
One day...

44
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,911
...he disappeared.

45
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,676
This is where I saw my father
for the last time.

46
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,952
In the beginning,
there existed twin spirits

47
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,594
who represented good and evil

48
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,638
Both possessed creative power.

49
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,639
Ahura Mazda is light and life,

50
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,513
and Ahriman, darkness and death.

51
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,035
Although nature is divided and rent
asunder by two conflicting principles,

52
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,549
man is free to choose

53
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,275
and will bring about
the ultimate triumph of good

54
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,438
for the overthrow
and annihilation of evil.

55
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,719
You're under arrest.

56
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,712
(Father urinates)

57
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,152
(Crowd sounds)

58
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,514
(Dog barks)

59
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,757
(Howling)

60
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,671
(Recitation from the Koran)

61
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,995
You grieve for a rabid dog.

62
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,230
The Prophet has said
the saliva of the dog is unclean.

63
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,354
Allah sends dogs to hell

64
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,031
(Chant praising God)

65
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,876
(Woman) 'I see a distant land.

66
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,399
'Something is written,

67
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,517
'something unresolved,

68
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,431
"The levels of time are confused.'

69
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,309
A tapestry of dreams,

70
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,438
reality woven into fiction.

71
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:21,912
I see successive revolutions
perpetuating a corrupt system.

72
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:29,754
There is & dark man struggling
against the forces of oppression

73
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,999
I see for him a violent death.

74
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,430
You bore his child.

75
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,395
I see him returning to his birthplace.

76
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,709
I hear the rush of wings.

77
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,594
(Beeps horn)

78
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,199
Wait for me.

79
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,199
There are some instructions
I have to give the workers.

80
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,152
You're under arrest.
