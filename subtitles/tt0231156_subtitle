Try and unite two estranged hearts

5
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,040
Why must you worry?
It's a short life

6
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,090
Let's sing merrily
and make others happy

7
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,420
Try and unite two estranged hearts

8
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,420
Humanity is another name for love

9
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,310
So let's bring glory to mankind

10
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,800
Try and unite two estranged hearts

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,940
It's a free life;
why must you live in ruin?

Let's save people from ruin

13

Go for your goal merrily

15
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,820
Try and unite two estranged hearts

16
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,070
- Who are you?
- Wrong question.

17
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,130
It's a tall, broad, young man.
Can't you see?

18
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,620
- What's your name?
- The name's Laat Saab (Big Boss).

19
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,070
Are you blind?
Can't you see it's a curfew?

20
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,060
All bosses are blind.
Don't you know that?

21
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,360
- You seem to be a decent man.
- You think I'm like you?

22
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,690
Get lost.

23
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,530
- Where do I go?
- Home.

24
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,360
- Home? I'm homeless.
- Go to hell.

25
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,980
Let's go to hell then.
It'll be fun together.

26
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,580
You know, men of your ilk
are out on the roads tonight.

27
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,770
- What if I'm waylaid again?
- Where's your house?

28
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,960
Bosses live where they like.

29
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,310
In India, I stay where I like.

30
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,650
- Go away.
- Where do I go?

31
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,640
Go away!

32
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,860
Hurry.

33
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,980
Sister, I can't sleep,
I'm hungry.

34
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,120
Prakash, it's very late in the night.

35
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,890
Where do I get food for you now?

36
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,160
Will I starve tonight too?

37
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,510
Adversity puts us to the test, Prakash.

38
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,430
After father passed away...

39
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,630
we've been at the receiving end.

40
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,140
Are we the only ones
God puts to test?

41
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,360
Why doesn't God put
those millionaires to test?

42
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,330
- Why does He take it out on the poor?
- No...

43
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,850
don't say that, Prakash.

44
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,430
Even I'm hungry.

45
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,720
As you know...

46
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,570
everything in the house is pawned.

47
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,250
They'll be taken away tomorrow.
We'll be left...

48
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,470
with father's only memento, a ring.

49
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,100
Sell it off to aunt tomorrow.

50
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,600
Lady, you can't hear me.

51
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,240
But I shall get you bread, somehow.

52
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,400
Even if I have to go to jail.

53
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,420
Get up.

54
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,000
Up!

55
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,940
Hurry up.

56
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,040
- So it's you.
- Yes.

57
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,130
- You're trapped, sonny.
- Can't help it. I failed.

58
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,830
- Come on! To the police station.
- I know.

59
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,570
Let me give this bread to the needy.

60
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,380
Else, two hungry people
won't sleep tonight.

61
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,190
- Are you the city's messiah?
- No, constable.

62
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,870
- You know the name is Big Boss.
- C'mon!

63
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,360
- Constable...
- Go on, quick.

64
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,730
- Here you are.
- Who are you?

65
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,070
Laat Saab.

66
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,490
I have no time, the regiment
is waiting for me. Take it.

67
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,240
How do you know we're hungry?

68
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,730
I know, because I'm also poor.
Take it.

69
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,000
No.

70
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,000
Thank you, but I can't accept it.

71
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,140
Quandary did me in.
Same with you.

72
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,870
- Please take it.
- C'mon.

73
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,680
The State provides me bodyguards.
Bye.

74
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,330
Who the hell?

75
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,680
What's your name?

76
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,390
- Nice tone to start a conversation.
- Shut up.

77
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,690
- Tone, my foot!
- Oh, you talk so sweet.

78
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,710
Inspector, just imagine...

79
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,990
if I were in your shoes
and you in mine...

80
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,850
and I'm yelling at you,
how would you feel?

81
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,590
I see.

82
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,440
- What's your name, sir?
- That's more like it.

83
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,610
I have a name,
but they call me Laat Saab.

84
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,430
- What do you do, sir?
- Need you ask?

85
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,970
- I nurture people like you.
- Damn you!

86
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,130
The two of you are witness.

87
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,880
- He is committing a grave crime.
- What crime?

88
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,900
I broke the curfew,
he'll break my skull.

89
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,300
Get in, smartass.

90
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,940
No.

91
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,220
Can one fall in love with me...

92
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,420
at first sight?

93
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,200
First sight? Just a glimpse,
and he won't forget you all his life.

94
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,990
Naughty boy.

95
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,390
He's right.

96
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,100
God made me beautiful.

97
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,550
All girls have
that misconception, sister.

98
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,180
Just you wait!

99
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,440
- My hand!
- Let go of my ear!

100
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,560
- My hand!
- Let go of my ear first.

101
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,170
Let it go!

102
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,430
How can you be so heartless?
Her father died just recently.

103
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,790
- How can I evict her?
- Unless she vacates the house...

104
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,160
we won't pay rent.
We won't let such a girl live here.

105
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,140
No way!

106
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,180
Done. Have patience.

107
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,950
I've exchanged glances with a stranger

108
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,000
My heart skips a beat.
Am I falling in love?

109
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,600
I've exchanged glances with a stranger

110
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,310
When I woke up today...

111
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,950
I felt as if something
struck my heart

112
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,040
I've exchanged glances with a stranger

113
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,870
My heart skips a beat.
Am I falling in love?

114
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,000
I've exchanged glances with a stranger

115
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,370
The stranger was so brave

116
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,720
He stole my heart away

117
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,630
He stole my heart away
right under my nose

118
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,290
My heart skips a beat.
Am I falling in love?

119
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,910
I've exchanged glances with a stranger

120
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,960
Twenty... and thirty.

121
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,800
Be careful.

122
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,160
- It's you!
- I need to talk to you.

123
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,500
Please come in.

124
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,840
Be seated.

125
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,380
- Tell me.
- I don't say that you are bad.

126
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,810
But it's bad for a young girl
to stay alone.

127
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,840
- Any complaints?
- God knows if it's true.

128
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,800
I hear that at nights...

129
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,270
a loafer comes... forget it.

130
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,830
Aunt, you are doing well.

131
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,600
- Where do you keep the money?
- Why?

132
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,110
Just asking. If you tell me
before you die...

133
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,590
I'll give you a proper funeral.

134
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,690
So you are waiting for me to die!

135
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,370
Just you wait!

136
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,480
I can't anger the other tenants
for your sake.

137
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,110
Besides, you haven't paid me
for the last three months.

138
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,660
I'll pay you the entire amount
once Prakash returns.

139
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,020
Rich people drive blindly!
They mowed him down.

140
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,740
Prakash! Prakash!

141
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,530
You think you are human beings?
If you can't help others...

142
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,790
- at least don't condemn them!
- One must condemn the bad ones.

143
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,550
I saw it myself. A loafer was
talking to her that night.

144
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,800
- Then the cops took him away.
- I know her.

145
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,270
She isn't that type.
You folks are cruel.

146
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,110
When her father was alive,
none of you dared taunt her.

147
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,940
Why argue?
We'll live with our own opinions.

148
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:47,780
Hardly matters.
You folks kicked her out finally.

149
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,030
Her brother was mowed down
by a car.

150
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,690
Not one soul went to mourn.
What do you want?

151
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,350
Cabbage and tomato.

152
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,160
Prince...

153
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,130
Aliens!

154
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,980
- Gotcha! What's your problem now?
- There's a problem. Let me go.

155
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,130
Prince!

156
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,700
- We're tired of looking for you.
- Really?

157
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,770
- Don't you have other work to do?
- Your mother writes every day.

158
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,630
She wants you back home.
Where do you wander?

159
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,980
- Tell him.
- In hell.

160
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,180
What are you saying?
He belongs to a rich family.

161
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,470
His actions speak otherwise.

162
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,530
- Prince, where have you been living?
- If only I had a home.

163
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,830
All the houses in the city
belong to me, so do the streets.

164
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,460
I sleep where I want to,
I wander where I want to.

165
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,900
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm his manager.

166
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,020
He isn't a manager, constable.
He is a con man.

167
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,790
I see.

168
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,370
- Come on!
- No, wait! Prince...

169
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,360
This isn't fair.
I've been looking for you like crazy.

170
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,410
And I was looking for you like crazy.

171
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,020
- Come on.
- Take him away.

172
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,150
Prince, your mother is seriously ill.

173
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,990
Your mother is seriously ill.

174
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,760
Take it.

175
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,470
You too... take it.

176
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,730
It's you!

177
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,380
Have some.

178
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,610
- It won't fill your stomach though.
- No, thanks.

179
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,770
You're being formal again.
The next station is six hours away.

180
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,440
Have some.

181
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,850
I'm not hungry.

182
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,950
I'm sorry I couldn't help you much.

183
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,030
I'm ashamed too, you were maligned
because of me.

184
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,780
Well, you know how I spent the night
at the lockup?

185
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,730
Handkerchief.

186
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,390
Wipe your tears.

187
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,190
You're being too much. If you cry,
God will punish the entire world.

188
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,500
Every teardrop of yours is like
a bomb. Wipe your tears, please.

189
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,460
Porter!

190
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,100
- May I say something?
- Go ahead.

191
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,250
- Or should I shut up?
- Tell me.

192
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,640
- May I?
- Say what you have to.

193
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
Actually...

194
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,840
Well, let alone me, even the most
courageous ones get nervous.

195
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,120
- Then stay quiet.
- That's the problem.

196
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,320
I can't stay quiet,
nor can I speak out.

197
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,330
I'd rather write it there.

198
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,700
'I love you.
I hope you won't forget me'.

199
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,470
Did you read?

200
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,610
No.

201
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,580
Please write an answer.

202
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,930
I'm illiterate.
I can't read or write.

203
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,200
It's a question of my life,
and you are joking.

204
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,810
Please write.

205
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,430
Turn around.

206
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,840
Don't look here until I finish.

207
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,310
Fine.

208
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,730
- Not fair.
- All right, write.

209
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,910
I forgot your name.

210
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,620
What style.
You remember it, though.

211
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,000
Laat Saab.

212
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,380
'I hope you won't forget me'.

213
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:13,340
Don't forget this rendezvous,
this journey

214
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,810
Now that you have stolen my heart,
don't forget me

215
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,610
My heart has fallen for you

216
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,200
Oh, those demure eyes

217
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,350
Now that Cupid has struck me,
don't forget me

218
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,830
Don't forget this rendezvous,
this journey

219
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,270
With much hope
I've surrendered my heart

220
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,400
I love you, I desire you

221
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:09,270
Don't forget
these eyes full of love

222
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,980
Doctor, where am I?

223
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,050
- You're in a hospital.
- Where's the girl who was with me?

224
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,300
There are so many injured girls here.
Look for her.

225
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,450
- Doctor, I didn't find her.
- I can't help it.

226
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,020
Search other hospitals.

227
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,730
Did you give her the medicines?

228
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,770
Get some sweet lime juice.

229
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,500
Medicines.

230
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,110
I wonder what my son is doing.

231
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,480
You worry about him every now and then
and you harass me too.

232
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,150
We have but one son.

233
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,270
You'd rather have had none.

234
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,330
What a thing to say.
No matter what...

235
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,990
- he is our son.
- Just imagine.

236
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,240
We spent so much on his studies,
we pampered him.

237
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,920
We pinned our hopes on him,
that he'd grow up to be our support.

238
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,010
The relationship with children
isn't business.

239
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,930
Even children have duties towards us.
Did we sweat it out...

240
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,240
so that he'd give all the money
away to the poor?

241
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,040
My money is not for him to squander.
He can't touch a penny...

242
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,270
unless he lives by my rules.
If he has the guts...

243
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,160
let him work in a mill,
let him plough the fields.

244
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,740
That's how it'll be, father.

245
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,370
I don't need your money.
However, don't forget that...

246
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,270
you have a duty towards society.

247
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,940
The selfish attitude of your ilk
has diseased people with poverty.

248
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,440
If it is not treated,
it'll only grow worse.

249
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,160
That's the way it is,
and will be.

250
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,920
So will be the chaos and atrocities
against the poor happen.

251
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,660
So will the world be destroyed
and made again.

252
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,750
I ask, why are you here?

253
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,040
The news of mother's sickness
drew me here.

254
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,340
You can't meet here. Go away.

255
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,026
- Son!
- Why did you come out?

256
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,700
- Son!
- The doctor forbids you from walking.

257
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,590
Mother...

258
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,870
- My son.
- Nurse! Summon the doctor, quick.

259
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,470
No need to call the doctor.

260
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,350
My doctor is with me.

261
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,750
Mother...

262
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,410
Mother?

263
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,600
Son...

264
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,820
don't be stubborn.

265
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,780
Else, we'll always be unhappy.

266
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,010
Drink.

267
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,720
Son...

268
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,440
I won't live to say much to you.

269
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,130
You can never be happy...

270
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,280
while your father is unhappy.

271
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,730
Apologize to your father...

272
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,360
and let me die in peace.

273
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,850
Please forgive him, my lord.

274
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,810
She was a goddess.

275
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,420
With her, our hopes
have burnt to ashes.

276
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:38,390
Had she been alive, she'd have
changed the face of the village.

277
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,350
Do you hear, father?

278
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,060
Wealth, property...
everything is destructible.

279
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,310
But a poor man's blessings...

280
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,230
does one good forever.

281
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,440
Our attitude killed your mother.

282
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,130
I wish we had a reached
a sensible decision earlier.

283
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,850
Sadly, there was a terrible difference
of opinion existing between us.

284
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,630
And each one thought
the other was wrong.

285
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:29,480
Anyway, I must fulfill her wish.

286
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,780
Everything belongs to you now.

287
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,390
I've decided to go on a pilgrimage.

288
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,100
I hope I'll find peace.

289
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,430
Doctor!

290
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,040
How are you feeling now?

291
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,370
Please let me go.
Why don't you let me go?

292
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,560
Where do you want to go?

293
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,080
We'll drop you there.

294
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:12,850
You don't even remember that.
All right, try to tell us your name.

295
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,170
My name...

296
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,410
My name?

297
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,040
You remind me again!

298
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,600
I can't remember my name,
I've told you!

299
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,870
Doctor...

300
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,600
I think you are a shaman.

301
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,420
You've destroyed my memory.

302
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,160
Why did you destroy my memory? Why?

303
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,840
For God's sake, destroy the spell!
What do you have against me?

304
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,839
What do you hold against me?

305
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:21,209
Why did you bring me here?
Let me go.

306
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,590
- Let me go.
- Call for you, doctor.

307
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,540
Nurse?

308
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,640
- Did you see the loony girl?
- No.

309
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,580
- Boy! Did you see that girl?
- No, sir.

310
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,030
Find her before she vanishes.
Hurry.

311
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,110
The sky has turned green.

312
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,040
- Sparkler!
- Of course, it'll sparkle.

313
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,100
- I've had two doses!
- Look behind.

314
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:51,180
- The moon has come down on earth.
- Moon? It's the sun.

315
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,940
The sun doesn't rise during the day.
She's a fairy.

316
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,760
Doctor, the guard looked everywhere.

317
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,620
But he didn't find her.

318
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,440
What do we do now?

319
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,720
- It'll bring disrepute to the hospital.
- And to you.

320
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,070
- You were on duty.
- I just went to take a call...

321
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,860
and she vanished.
Strange girl.

322
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,960
- Who was she?
- She was tall...

323
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,670
royal nose...

324
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,330
fair complexion...

325
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,980
sensuous eyes...

326
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,030
beautiful forehead...

327
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,850
melodious voice...

328
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,540
musical tone.

329
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,060
- Doctor, you're married.
- I'm sorry.

330
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,490
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

331
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,350
- Yes?
- I'm looking for a girl.

332
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,200
- Who is she?
- We met with a train accident.

333
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,530
God knows who it is.
Forty women are dead.

334
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,150
Fifty were given first aid
and discharged.

335
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,160
- No one is in the hospital now?
- No.

336
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,816
- Can you describe her?
- Doctor, no one is in the hospital?

337
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,340
Can you describe her?

338
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,410
- Describe her?
- Yes.

339
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,040
Tall...

340
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:14,390
royal nose, fair complexion...

341
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,700
sensuous eyes...

342
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,420
beautiful forehead...

343
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,150
melodious voice...

344
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,800
musical tone.

345
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,800
- Where is she?
- She was...

346
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,810
- like someone's musical composition.
- Where is she?

347
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,840
I'd also like to know that.

348
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,110
- Bye.
- Bye.

349
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,790
How are you feeling?

350
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,840
Are you a doctor?

351
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,280
No.

352
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,590
I'm a philosophy professor
at lmperial College.

353
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,040
I am Professor Nath.

354
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,380
- How did I get here?
- I'd like to know that.

355
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,240
I don't know how I came here.

356
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,770
How did I end up here?

357
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,780
I'm sorry.

358
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,420
I shouldn't have come here.

359
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,780
Forgive me.

360
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,890
For God's sake, forgive me.

361
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,630
What are you doing?
Please don't weep.

362
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,690
Else, God will destroy the world.

363
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,890
Women's teardrops are like atom bombs.

364
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,470
Here... wipe your tears.

365
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,130
I thought it was my house.

366
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,870
Can you tell me where my house is?

367
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,070
Your house?

368
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,150
Your house?

369
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,180
I was only joking.
This is your house.

370
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,140
Is this my house?

371
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,480
Yes.

372
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:55,410
You used to play that piano.
Remember?

373
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,020
Those books you used to read?

374
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,510
Really? What's my name?

375
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,630
Your name?

376
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,840
You have a beautiful name.

377
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,420
Your name is... Kamini

378
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,180
Kamini.

379
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,000
How are you related to me?

380
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,080
You forgot?

381
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,490
Let it be. I'll tell you later.

382
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,160
Go and sleep.

383
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,550
I think you've forgotten your room.

384
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,590
It's there.

385
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,160
Upstairs. Over there.

386
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,750
Remember?

387
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,330
Go on.

388
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,510
You lent me support

389
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,756
How could you forget me?

390
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:24,290
You robbed me of my peace

391
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:50,850
Come to me, I'm distressed

392
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,420
Even my fate has turned against me

393
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:05,690
My stars seem to destroy me

394
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,320
You lent me support

395
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,350
How could you forget me?

396
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:43,710
I'm in agony, I'm heartbroken

397
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:49,530
Who is calling out to me?

398
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:01,040
I don't know what's happening
to my heart

399
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:06,920
It's crying out in pain

400
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:15,870
Someone is touching my heart

401
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:21,790
Who is calling out to me?

402
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:33,430
Oh, the storms in life

403
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:38,910
My heart hopes for your return

404
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,990
My ship is caught in a whirlwind

405
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,880
The horizon seems so far

406
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,540
For all your support...

407
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,520
why aren't you here
at this juncture?

408
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,470
The agony in my heart...

409
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,270
torments me no end

410
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,930
Someone tell me...

411
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:11,090
who does this to me

412
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,910
You stole my heart...

413
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,780
at first sight

414
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:25,310
Oh, who is calling out to me?

415
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:47,990
Now what?

416
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,790
What is the commotion outside?

417
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:56,240
What noise is that?
I can't bear to hear it.

418
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,640
You are the reason for the commotion,
you were singing.

419
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,240
- You were singing too.
- You must be dreaming.

420
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,980
You were singing.

421
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:10,910
Was I?

422
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,960
I won't sing again... never.

423
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,480
You sang to wake up forever.

424
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,350
You will sleep...

425
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,600
but I'll never sleep again.

426
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,530
Go to bed.

427
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,930
Come on.

428
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,050
This way.

429
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,060
Please take me to some quiet place.

430
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:21,360
Some place far away
to the wilderness.

431
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,570
Any problem here? Why do you want
to go to the wilderness at midnight?

432
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:30,530
- I'm feeling queasy.
- Damn, you are an enigma.

433
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,880
Please hurry up,
or I'll go alone.

434
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,310
Let's go then.

435
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,260
I'm stuck with a mad girl.

436
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,490
God help you, professor.

437
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,510
For the first time
you've fallen in love.

438
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,230
And with a mad girl, too.

439
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,290
What did you say?
Am I mad?

440
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,870
Not you. I am mad.

441
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,260
Cover yourself.
It's chilly outside.

442
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,580
What happened?
Did lightning strike the car?

443
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,320
No. The lightning struck my heart.

444
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,620
And my car bears the brunt of it.

445
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,420
What does the car say?

446
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,300
Her mind is fine, she says...

447
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,420
but she needs rest
in this stormy night.

448
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,750
She can't move.

449
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,490
At least shut the hood.

450
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,330
Shut the hood.

451
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,430
Battered and showered.

452
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,310
The hood, too, need repairs.

453
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,640
- This car can't be fixed.
- What do we do now?

454
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,840
Swat flies, what else?

455
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,710
That looks like a mansion
of the East India Company era.

456
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,120
That's where we'll stay. C'mon.

457
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,800
Strange coincidence.

458
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,920
You stepped out
and the clouds burst.

459
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,400
Looks like you fell from the clouds.

460
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,840
What's that noise?

461
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,020
- What's that noise?
- They belong to our fraternity.

462
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,620
- Meaning?
- They are frogs.

463
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:43,580
They're also running out scared,
like us.

464
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,510
In this stormy night...

465
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:57,750
we should be sleeping
in our soft silken beds.

466
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,980
Thanks to you,
we're sleeping in a stable.

467
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,080
Well, it's fine...

468
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,350
since you must be relaxing happily.

469
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:14,730
And I feel...

470
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,460
as if I'll find peace here.

471
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,410
Why are you staring at me?

472
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,390
Such delicate questions
are unanswerable.

473
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,490
Please turn away.

474
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:49,440
The thunderous weather is enough
to lead me astray.

475
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,740
I can't fight against two
of the same kind.

476
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,580
Please go to sleep.

477
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:44,920
Why did she give her heart away?

478
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:49,050
Oh, what has she done?

479
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:55,110
She has melted my heart

480
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:25,950
She hardly knows
the meaning of love

481
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:31,820
And I've fallen for her

482
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:40,840
When it hurts,
my heart cries out

483
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,690
I can't take a heartbreak

484
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:50,600
She is so near...

485
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,390
yet so far away

486
00:54:55,230 --> 00:55:00,380
Oh, I live to see this day

487
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:23,190
I remember someone...

488
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,740
I had forgotten

489
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,250
Oh, who has touched...

490
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,960
a nerve again?

491
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,560
Once again the agony of love...

492
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,540
grips my heart

493
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,110
I am choking...

494
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,890
to death

495
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,510
Who has stepped...

496
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,630
into my life...

497
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,330
and ensnared my very being?

498
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,900
Oh heart, tell me...

499
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:10,600
who called out to me?

500
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,760
Who has made me weep...

501
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,650
tears of joy?

502
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,010
I remember someone...

503
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:25,670
I had forgotten

504
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,900
Oh, who has touched...

505
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,310
a nerve again?

506
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,420
Hello, professor. Where are you
coming from all tied up?

507
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,580
It's Laat. My car broke down
when I went hunting.

508
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:13,700
That's a big game.
It took an entire cart.

509
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,060
- It's a lion.
- Lion? I must see.

510
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,940
Don't! It's alive.

511
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,620
It's a lioness, professor.

512
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,620
I couldn't find peace
all over the world.

513
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,370
One finds peace only at home.
I will stay here.

514
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,690
Sir, you are rich people,
who stay in the city.

515
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,450
- You won't like the village.
- Why not?

516
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:01,450
What's our life anyway?
A small house...

517
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,700
cattle, we, cow dung and stove,
that's all.

518
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:11,000
We walk in knee deep waters
during monsoon.

519
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:16,170
At nights, dew falls on us,
and during daytime it's dust.

520
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,710
How will you live here, sir?

521
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:26,070
Uncle, I will live like you.
I am no different from you.

522
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,200
Sir, if you've made up your mind...

523
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:32,450
why don't you build a mansion?

524
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,650
How will you live in these ruins?

525
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,480
No matter how one's own land is...

526
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:41,810
it is dearer.

527
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,340
Have you forgotten?
I was born in this mansion.

528
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:52,170
If you say, we'll fix it.

529
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:57,610
After the village is fixed.

530
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:03,280
But sir, will your father
agree to it?

531
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,310
He has already agreed to it.

532
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:10,450
Watch the muck, sir.

533
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:15,220
It's gold, uncle.
Soil is where life grows.

534
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,990
It's true, sir.
But muck should not be everywhere.

535
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,350
Yes, every little thing
has a certain place in life.

536
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,920
Watch the pit, sir!

537
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,620
How long will one fall?
It's time to rise now.

538
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,730
We must change our lives now.
We must make roads.

539
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,320
We have to make beautiful houses
in place of these shanties.

540
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,200
We have to get a pipeline here, so
that we don't have to go far for water.

541
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,580
We will have electricity.

542
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,560
We will have schools and hospitals
and every thing we need.

543
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:53,180
It'll be a new world.
Everyone will be happy.

544
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,980
There will be no discrimination.

545
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,370
Now get back to work. Goodbye.

546
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:16,920
I don't know why my heart throbs

547
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:43,490
Across the Jamuna river
lives my beloved

548
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:52,540
Oh, youth is so tormenting

549
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:01,160
I can't hold back my passions

550
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,490
I yearn
for my childhood sweetheart

551
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:36,460
When the cuckoo sings
in my courtyard...

552
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:45,020
I can't bear the anguish
in her song

553
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:11,530
My heart is like a ship
on troubled waters

554
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:20,670
Restless as it is,
my heart seeks its boatswain

555
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:29,210
I can't negotiate
the whirlwinds anymore

556
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,090
What is it? Who are you?
Why did you clap?

557
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:59,740
What are you staring at?
Are you dumb? Why don't you talk?

558
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,640
- You sing very well.
- Why did you listen to me?

559
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:09,150
Coincidence. I was passing by.
Your song stopped me.

560
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:12,480
I know you came here on purpose.
Lowly city chap.

561
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:18,210
You are mistaken.
I'm also a villager.

562
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:23,580
Villager, my foot!
You're wearing imported clothes.

563
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:26,290
You're quite sharp.

564
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,500
They call me Mirch (Chilli)

565
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,210
Salt, chilli, turmeric, spices,
what kind of names are those?

566
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:39,550
Take that.

567
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:45,760
What are you doing?
Come on, apologize to him.

568
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:49,700
Apologize to him.
He's our young master.

569
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:54,090
Master...

570
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:58,290
Never mind.

571
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,620
Do you like this necklace?

572
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:15,220
I think you should try this.
It's very beautiful.

573
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,100
Try it on.

574
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:22,110
She'd like to try on this one.

575
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,070
- Hello, professor.
- Hello, Laat.

576
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:54,660
Have you quit being a professor?
Hunter, jeweller...

577
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,170
are you trying something new?

578
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,860
I shouldn't be hiding this from you.

579
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:06,020
Someone has walked into my life.

580
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:12,700
Professor, you have found someone...

581
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,080
- while I have lost someone. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

582
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:32,600
I told you!
It looks so beautiful on you.

583
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:58,350
Get off.

584
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:06,320
Now that you've had a ride,
take care of it. Don't fight.

585
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,040
- I'll take care it.
- I'll take care it!

586
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:15,180
- You're back, sir!
- Good you came, uncle.

587
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,310
It's aunt Ganga's daughter's wedding.

588
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,270
Here's her gift.

589
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,360
Ganga!

590
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:30,590
Quiet.

591
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:41,220
- Don't mess with me now.
- I won't fight.

592
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,910
Let's compromise. Get up.

593
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,010
- Compromise?
- Yes, compromise.

594
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:55,170
The young master has given
gold bangles for your daughter.

595
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,420
- What is it?
- Jaggery sherbet.

596
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,600
- Why?
- For the compromise.

597
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,570
I hope you aren't up to any tricks?

598
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:15,220
- I'm sorry. Forgive me.
- Why feel sorry about it?

599
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:18,730
You know, father hit me
black and blue that night.

600
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:23,080
I had to apply salve.
See the scars.

601
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:28,310
- I'm so sorry.
- No good.

602
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:31,500
- I was thrashed because of you.
- Because of me?

603
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,550
It was because of your pranks.

604
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:37,560
- You were the mischievous one.
- I?

605
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:44,560
Now that you've had me beaten,
don't forget me.

606
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:09,190
Why doesn't he burn?

607
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:13,160
Why doesn't the firefly burn?

608
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:35,229
The fire burns passionately...

609
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:39,019
and plays with the firefly

610
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:42,030
Yet, the firefly doesn't burn

611
01:08:58,069 --> 01:09:01,729
lnfatuation is love

612
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,979
And one slowly...

613
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:16,450
and gradually...

614
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:20,060
burns in the fires of love

615
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:30,230
Yet, the firefly doesn't burn

616
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,540
Why doesn't he burn?

617
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:37,940
Why doesn't the firefly burn?

618
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:01,130
For a beauty, he could die

619
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:04,760
He would give up his life
for love

620
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,810
For united in love...

621
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:17,210
united they are
in life and death

622
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,090
So, why'd the firefly burn?

623
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,340
The fire burns passionately...

624
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,620
and plays with the firefly

625
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,930
Yet, the firefly doesn't burn

626
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,990
Professor, was your lecture
about songs today?

627
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,530
Yes. I taught the boys
about love today.

628
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,020
- It'll be useful to them.
- But...

629
01:10:56,470 --> 01:11:00,390
this song was about the fire
and the firefly.

630
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,890
It was about my personal life.

631
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,770
Why do you always stare at me...

632
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:19,940
as if you're trying to read me?

633
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:23,740
The more you read the scriptures,
the more you shall be blessed.

634
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,540
By God, you're blessed
with pristine looks.

635
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:31,130
You know how to flatter.

636
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:35,160
This beautiful night,
this loneliness...

637
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,430
and your voluptuous beauty...

638
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:45,080
compel me to tell you something.
May I?

639
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:49,170
For God's sake,
listen to a request.

640
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:55,140
For a thousand crimes of those
lost eyes, I'd own up every one.

641
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:05,610
You said, you'd take me to a doctor.

642
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:10,880
For my own sake, yes. I'm sick.

643
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:15,250
- What ails you?
- I've forgotten my past.

644
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,400
You're the one I think about.

645
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:24,570
Professor...

646
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,410
I want to recollect my past.

647
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:31,470
Wise folks
get rid of useless memories.

648
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,000
I...

649
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,630
I'm not wise.

650
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,160
You say that I'm mad.

651
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,420
No. I'm mad.

652
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:51,210
Now that I've listened to you,
at least listen to me.

653
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:56,510
- Tell me.
- It's quite sensitive.

654
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,670
- I can't bring it to my lips.
- Please say it.

655
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:05,540
- What do you want to say?
- Please tell me.

656
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:11,670
If... if you...
oh, what do I say?

657
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:19,370
It's such a sensitive matter
that even the brave ones get nervous.

658
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:24,560
They can hardly voice it.

659
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:33,550
Well, I'll write it over there.

660
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:36,350
Please come and read it.

661
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,220
Please come.

662
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:18,090
Please.

663
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,540
'I love you.
I hope you won't forget me'.

664
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,860
Did you read it?

665
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:49,960
- No.
- No?

666
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:52,110
Please read it.

667
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,440
Professor...

668
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,150
I can't read it.

669
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,020
- I can't read it, professor.
- Please!

670
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:07,290
Try to read it.
It's a question of my life.

671
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,130
I'm feeling dizzy.

672
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:14,430
I'm choking.

673
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:45,240
Doctor, please come over
at the soonest.

674
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:27,260
Don't worry.
I know her ailment.

675
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:28,930
How do you know?

676
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:32,480
She was brought to the hospital
after a train accident.

677
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,840
I wanted to treat her,
but she ran off.

678
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:42,090
Doctor, what does she suffer from?

679
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,010
She has lost her memory.
Every time she receives a shock...

680
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,530
- she'll get bouts like this.
- What's the treatment?

681
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,420
Brain surgery.

682
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,100
Doctor...

683
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,430
I don't want her
to undergo the surgery.

684
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:04,410
Such a beauty seldom
walks into one's life.

685
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:07,880
- Seldom?
- Only once, sir.

686
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:13,630
- And he has to be one in a million.
- Will you still suggest surgery?

687
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:16,400
- Sorry.
- Doctor, why don't you...

688
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:19,450
- suggest an alternate therapy for her?
- Try to keep her happy.

689
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:24,920
As far as possible,
try to keep her busy and engrossed.

690
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:28,440
Take her to the movies, theatres
divert her mind.

691
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:14,560
Professor, let's go home.
I'm feeling sick.

692
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:19,260
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. Let's go, quick.

693
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:21,730
Wait. I'll get a soft drink for you.

694
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:53,640
- Where were you?
- I was tired looking for you.

695
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,200
Let go!

696
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:58,390
Don't ever misbehave
with a decent woman!

697
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:05,350
I'm sorry.
She acts a bit strange.

698
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:07,570
Very sorry.

699
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,070
I want to cut my hand off
for hitting him.

700
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,570
I hit him, but it hurt me.

701
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:43,770
I want that stranger
to stare at me again.

702
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:50,570
I loved to see him stare at me.

703
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,300
Why did I hit him then?

704
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,770
I was crazy.

705
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,310
But the way he was staring at me!

706
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:21,220
Tonight...

707
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,580
Tonight I met gazes with him

708
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:34,200
Through my idle heart...

709
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:40,820
Through my idle heart,
a wave of joy drifted

710
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,710
Why did your heart cry out?

711
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:09,040
Who have my eyes clapped on?

712
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,820
I try to remember the past

713
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,990
I try to remember who sang for me

714
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,870
I hear in my heart...

715
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:31,360
I hear in my heart
a sweet wedding song

716
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,010
Tonight...

717
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:44,560
Tonight I met gazes with him

718
01:25:56,310 --> 01:26:00,330
My heart's not in place,
I'm clueless

719
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:10,560
I've lost sleep

720
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:16,380
I've lost my peace as well

721
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,500
I feel as if...

722
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:26,030
I feel as if I have recollected
a story of the past

723
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:32,720
Tonight...

724
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:39,110
Tonight I met gazes with him

725
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,590
Did you hear my song?

726
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:04,530
I think the professor doesn't like it.

727
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,770
No, you sing very well.

728
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,710
Not very well.
I just hum away...

729
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,760
- when I'm happy,
- Any reason for being happy?

730
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,520
It's a mystery even for me.

731
01:27:24,570 --> 01:27:28,220
Sometimes when my heart is thrilled...

732
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:32,890
I feel like singing and enjoying.

733
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,940
Then sing on. Who stops you?

734
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:40,620
What will I sing?
You are so angry.

735
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:44,560
If I sing, you might kill me.

736
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,500
I need to ask you something.
It's urgent.

737
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:53,040
Forget it.
I want to enjoy tonight.

738
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:56,450
I wish to go there right now.

739
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:01,200
I wish to go there
where we took shelter that night.

740
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,230
Where I found peace.

741
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,520
Shall we go?

742
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:15,880
My doubts are being confirmed.
I'm a man, after all.

743
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,350
Oh, I never thought of it.

744
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:24,000
I always thought of you
as a professor.

745
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,180
I suspect you.

746
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:30,750
I can see love growing in your heart
for that man.

747
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:34,780
Love for whom?

748
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,640
You lose your senses on seeing him.

749
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,420
You feel like apologizing
after hitting him.

750
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:44,770
You get thrilled at the sight of him.

751
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:49,290
Professor, I don't know why...

752
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:53,310
the thoughts of him...

753
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:58,420
cloud my heart and mind...

754
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:01,970
and daze me.

755
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:07,510
I feel as if we've
known each other forever.

756
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:14,160
But then when I think about it,
it feels like a dream.

757
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:19,120
Because, I don't know him.
I've never met him.

758
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:26,350
I don't know why my heart is drawn
towards him. Why, professor?

759
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:31,250
You can't put me off
with that childish banter.

760
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:37,310
Whether you know him or not,
you do have a soft spot for him.

761
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:41,840
If you dream such wild dreams,
what will happen to our lives?

762
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:45,930
We will be maligned, we won't be
able to step out of the house.

763
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:47,840
And I can't take that!

764
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:51,840
You belong to me.
And you shall be mine!

765
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,390
Don't say that, professor.

766
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:56,620
I've spoken my heart out.

767
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:01,080
- I never lie to you.
- You must promise me that...

768
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,650
you'll never consider him,
you'll never think about him.

769
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:08,490
I'll never think about him.

770
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:11,220
I'll never consider him.

771
01:30:12,670 --> 01:30:13,770
Never.

772
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:19,340
I don't know him...
why do I think about him?

773
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:23,470
I'll never think about him. Never.

774
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,950
- Jaggery sherbet.
- Why are you here?

775
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:11,500
Father told me to clean your room.

776
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:16,800
Have you done it?
Now get lost.

777
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:22,070
- Where are you going?
- I do all your work.

778
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,050
Why do you get angry with me?

779
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,980
You have no idea!

780
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:31,710
My heart is wounded!
There's no cure.

781
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,660
Wounded?

782
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:38,890
We treat our wounds with lime
and turmeric? Want to try?

783
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,360
- Will you get lost?
- You want it right away?

784
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,550
- Have the jaggery sherbet first.
- Damn!

785
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,920
Go away!

786
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:31,010
Let me apply the salve.
Where's the wound?

787
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:35,240
Wound? Apply it on my head!

788
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:37,380
Sure. Come here.

789
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:39,290
You're so innocent.

790
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:43,430
No, I'm quite bitter.
But when it comes to you...

791
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:50,960
God knows, I just can't be rude.

792
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:06,740
I wish she was like you.

793
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,210
She? Who?

794
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:16,090
- No one. I just joked.
- Don't hide it from me.

795
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,310
Say it clearly.
Do you love someone else?

796
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,160
Who is she?

797
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,870
- She's going to become someone's wife.
- Goodness!

798
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:36,890
Aren't you ashamed
to love someone's woman?

799
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:44,640
Father always says, 'Do not eye
other's bullock, land and woman'.

800
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:48,240
She might belong to someone now,
but she was mine.

801
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:53,730
The past belongs to no one.
Take India for example.

802
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:57,870
The British ruled India,
but now we rule it.

803
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:01,650
Now get the hell out of here.

804
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:03,710
Get lost.

805
01:34:13,130 --> 01:34:16,310
Tell me another thing, sir.

806
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:24,780
Does she also miss you so much?

807
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:32,160
No. She refused
to even recognize me.

808
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:37,710
Short memory?
You'd rather come out of it.

809
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,740
Go away now.

810
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:50,640
They always miss
those who forget them.

811
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:54,120
No one misses
the people who miss them.

812
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:20,070
Why are you here?
I haven't met you before.

813
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:24,630
I don't know you.
I have never loved you.

814
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:30,000
Get out of my room.
Get out.

815
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:32,060
Go away.

816
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:42,510
When I don't know you,
why do I think about you?

817
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:13,670
She must be...

818
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:19,240
feeling for me

819
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:22,040
She must be...

820
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:27,800
missing me

821
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:59,830
When she can't stop her tears...

822
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:08,820
she must be crying...

823
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:14,360
inconsolably

824
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:17,090
She must be...

825
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:22,940
missing me

826
01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:43,480
She must be...

827
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:50,240
holding her heart back

828
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:55,790
She must be knowing...

829
01:38:56,240 --> 01:39:01,120
many such tricks

830
01:39:01,450 --> 01:39:03,670
She must be...

831
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:09,150
feeling for me

832
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:16,960
Sing on. Why did you stop?

833
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,220
Why are you here?

834
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:24,310
I?

835
01:39:25,970 --> 01:39:27,620
I don't know why.

836
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:34,040
And coincidentally you are here.

837
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:37,090
When you were there...

838
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:49,100
I tried to call out to you,
but you left.

839
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:50,630
Why are you here?

840
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,840
I don't know why.

841
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:00,650
- I find peace here.
- You find peace here?

842
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:02,330
Yes.

843
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:08,710
How come you are here?

844
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,850
- This is my house.
- This is your house?

845
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:30,720
Then you can surely tell me...

846
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:37,640
why I find peace here.

847
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,790
Because I'm restless here.

848
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:49,710
I don't understand...

849
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:54,520
why I find peace here...

850
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:59,470
why you are restless here.

851
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:03,700
Some people find peace
in messing up others.

852
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:08,910
- It's a strange attitude.
- What?

853
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:14,290
Have I made you restless?

854
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,870
Are you asking me?
Ask your heart.

855
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:19,750
Ask those treacherous eyes!

856
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:25,770
Your fake innocence had ensnared me.
Oh, we were so close to each other...

857
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:28,650
like a bond of a thousand lifetimes!

858
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:30,130
What are you saying?

859
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:33,520
I don't understand.

860
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:41,400
- I remember nothing.
- Because you are selfish and disloyal.

861
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:47,310
When realization dawns,
we will look for each other...

862
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:51,070
we will suffer,
we will yearn for each other.

863
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:55,350
But no power on earth
can unite us then.

864
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,840
You will be the professor's wife.

865
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:06,190
And I will have married someone else.

866
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:13,990
Look at me.

867
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:18,120
I'm your own.
Don't be misled by others.

868
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:28,310
Do you remember the night of curfew
when I brought bread for you?

869
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:34,870
I don't remember.

870
01:42:36,430 --> 01:42:37,830
I remember nothing.

871
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,140
My mind is blank.

872
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:53,690
I just remember that...

873
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:58,310
I ran away from the hospital
and entered the professor's house.

874
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:02,900
I didn't even remember my name.

875
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:06,980
Thanks to the professor...

876
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:11,490
for reminding me that
it was my own house.

877
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:16,430
- My name is Kamini.
- The professor is lying.

878
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:20,830
It's not your house,
you aren't Kamini either.

879
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:26,690
- What's my name then?
- Kamini.

880
01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:31,500
Let's go home.

881
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,760
Professor, I need to talk to you.

882
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,710
Midnight is not the time to talk.

883
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:50,050
You can come to the college tomorrow.

884
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:52,700
No. I need answers right now.

885
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:55,710
One doesn't misbehave with teachers.

886
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:57,930
I have taught you in college.

887
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:02,560
This is about destiny, sir.

888
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:06,110
Teacher and student
sail on the same boat here.

889
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:13,890
You want to ask me now?
Fine, come on.

890
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:25,160
Why don't you get her treated?
I know, she has lost her memory.

891
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:30,790
- Finally! But I knew it all along.
- Is it not a crime?

892
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:33,760
In love, no crime is a crime.

893
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,390
Blinded in love,
you are playing with her life.

894
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,880
That's fair in love.
Someone plays with your life.

895
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:44,040
- Or you play with someone's life.
- Professor!

896
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:47,070
Professor, let's go home.

897
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:15,180
I fell in love...

898
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:19,030
to gain nothing

899
01:45:19,490 --> 01:45:22,840
I just lost my peace

900
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:58,270
What do I say...

901
01:45:58,390 --> 01:46:01,760
about my tragic story?

902
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:15,750
Did he ever care?

903
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:23,320
The one I wish for...

904
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:26,560
belongs to someone else

905
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:30,550
I fell in love...

906
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:34,400
to gain nothing

907
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,180
I just lost my peace

908
01:46:55,420 --> 01:47:00,200
My eyes deceived me,
I weep in silence

909
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:13,880
I failed to create
my world of love

910
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,410
I was fine...

911
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:21,110
until I fell in love

912
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:23,930
Then I ruined my life

913
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:28,240
I fell in love...

914
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:33,270
to gain nothing!
I just lost my peace

915
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:55,790
You held me close...

916
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:59,550
only to betray me

917
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:06,160
You have created another legend

918
01:48:12,830 --> 01:48:16,020
My tragic story...

919
01:48:16,270 --> 01:48:19,620
you could never remember

920
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:22,590
You ruined me with a smile

921
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:26,580
I fell in love...

922
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:30,220
to gain nothing

923
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:33,250
I just lost my peace

924
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:43,680
'You are playing dirty'.

925
01:48:45,070 --> 01:48:46,470
'This is not your life'.

926
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,780
'God made you to teach others'.

927
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:53,840
'You are not made for love'.

928
01:48:55,580 --> 01:48:59,690
'Moreover, not for the one
who can never belong to you'.

929
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,270
'She belonged to someone else'.

930
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,300
'She belonged to someone else'.

931
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,500
'She will belong to someone else'.

932
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:12,430
'You are intruding,
you are ruining their lives'.

933
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:19,310
I will go and tell her
that I'm getting her treated.

934
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:23,450
Once she recovers,
she is free to decide.

935
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:26,650
She can marry anyone she wants.

936
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:49,050
'Oh, could beauty have another face?'

937
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:52,160
'No! Don't be insane'.

938
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,820
'Everyone in this world
is an opportunist'.

939
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:57,740
'So be an opportunist'.

940
01:49:58,770 --> 01:50:00,580
'Why must you abandon a treasure?'

941
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:03,960
'You adhere to your own philosophy...'

942
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:06,050
'so why care about the world?'

943
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:08,390
'Fulfil your wish'.

944
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:12,350
'Life is all about happiness
and success'.

945
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:27,540
At the final stage,
I'm staggering.

946
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:33,340
Thanks to someone's youth and beauty.

947
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:36,760
No one can snatch you away from me.

948
01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:40,080
No one can snatch you away.

949
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:19,360
He must be...

950
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:24,870
feeling for me

951
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:27,430
He must be...

952
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:32,900
missing me

953
01:51:51,870 --> 01:51:56,210
He must be...

954
01:51:56,290 --> 01:52:01,620
holding his heart back

955
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:07,576
He must be knowing...

956
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,600
many such tricks

957
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:23,830
He must be...

958
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:29,180
feeling for me

959
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:31,800
He must be...

960
01:52:32,350 --> 01:52:37,980
missing me

961
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,890
Wonderful song.

962
01:52:43,010 --> 01:52:45,490
Painful, it touched my heart.

963
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,440
- Do you like it?
- I loved it.

964
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:55,960
I too love it.
The stranger sang it last night.

965
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:59,430
- The stranger sang it?
- Yes.

966
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:02,590
It's a filthy song.

967
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:07,610
A good song always touches the heart.

968
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:15,780
I can sing better than him.
Would you like to hear?

969
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:18,190
- Sure, go ahead.
- All right.

970
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:33,620
She stole my heart,
she is so innocent

971
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:42,240
She has a unique style

972
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:08,250
She is the one who taught me love

973
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:18,900
Those eyes have given
a new meaning to my life

974
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:34,470
Oh, how do I hold my heart back?

975
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:36,420
She is so innocent

976
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:42,720
She stole my heart,
she is so innocent

977
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:58,200
Don't torment me,
don't break my heart

978
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,890
Don't drive me to despair

979
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:20,320
I don't wish for a heartbreak

980
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:22,260
She is so innocent

981
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:28,640
She stole my heart,
she is so innocent

982
01:55:37,350 --> 01:55:41,210
Her style so sensuous,
her eyes so intoxicating

983
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:50,270
All set to kill

984
01:56:01,790 --> 01:56:06,010
Who wouldn't give up
his life for her?

985
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:08,040
For her innocent looks?

986
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:14,420
She stole my heart,
she is so innocent

987
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:20,980
Like it?

988
01:56:22,330 --> 01:56:24,530
It was a filthy song.

989
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:25,940
What?

990
01:56:55,090 --> 01:56:59,480
I ask you for the last time.
Are you going to get her treated?

991
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:04,150
- You need to see a psychologist.
- My mind won't be sound...

992
01:57:04,730 --> 01:57:07,930
- until you decide for her.
- Do you know...

993
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:11,620
- what is the treatment?
- Yes. Surgery.

994
01:57:12,010 --> 01:57:15,850
Then you must know
that brain surgery is very risky.

995
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:20,950
- I know very well.
- So why do you want to invite trouble?

996
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:25,640
Because I can't see her dreams shatter
right in front of me.

997
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:28,730
Remember, you said...

998
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:32,050
that I was being selfish.

999
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:35,710
Just because you are selfish now...

1000
01:57:36,450 --> 01:57:38,350
you want to put her life at risk.

1001
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:42,270
No one can be more selfish.

1002
01:57:43,010 --> 01:57:44,310
You are mistaken.

1003
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,550
One finds happiness
only when the soul is at peace.

1004
01:57:48,110 --> 01:57:50,740
She isn't happy.
I want her soul to be at peace.

1005
01:57:51,390 --> 01:57:53,290
She is happy with her life.

1006
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:56,440
Please let her be happy.

1007
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:59,390
She is living a life
worse than death.

1008
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,180
You think so.

1009
01:58:02,050 --> 01:58:03,650
I don't want to argue with you.

1010
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,420
I'm getting late for college.

1011
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:14,710
I won't let you go to college
until you arrive at a decision.

1012
01:58:15,770 --> 01:58:17,710
You and I can never
reach a conclusion on this.

1013
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:22,240
I've made up my mind.
There will be a conclusion.

1014
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:29,680
This has driven you utterly crazy.

1015
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:31,850
Everything is fair in love.

1016
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:36,220
I don't want a lecture,
I want an answer.

1017
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:40,680
Adversity makes a man fearless.

1018
01:58:41,130 --> 01:58:43,470
Heartbreak drives one insane.

1019
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:46,160
He doesn't care for the fearless.

1020
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:57,660
If this is what I've taught you...

1021
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:02,870
if my teachings force you to do this...

1022
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:06,880
then go ahead and kill your teacher.

1023
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:15,280
What are you staring at?
Why don't you kill me?

1024
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:19,360
If you think you are right,
why don't you shoot me? Shoot!

1025
01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:29,750
You are right.

1026
01:59:31,170 --> 01:59:32,730
A teacher is like one's father.

1027
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:35,720
I can't kill you.

1028
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:42,880
I'd rather kill myself!

1029
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:46,190
- What are you doing?
- You can do anything after I die.

1030
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:48,620
- I can't live without her.
- Will you listen to me?

1031
01:59:48,770 --> 01:59:50,220
- You have said it!
- No.

1032
01:59:53,180 --> 01:59:57,830
You said, a teacher is
like one's father.

1033
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:02,950
A father cannot see his son
drop dead before him.

1034
02:00:06,510 --> 02:00:07,910
Take her away.

1035
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:11,600
Take her away as soon as possible...

1036
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:15,570
before I change my mind.

1037
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:19,500
I'm human, after all.

1038
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:49,020
He must be...

1039
02:00:49,590 --> 02:00:55,870
feeling for me

1040
02:00:57,620 --> 02:01:00,330
She must be...

1041
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:06,960
missing me

1042
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:12,830
He must be...

1043
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:18,560
missing me

1044
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:24,190
She must be...

1045
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:30,720
feeling for me

1046
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:38,130
You love this song.

1047
02:01:39,590 --> 02:01:42,780
- Why are you here?
- I'm here to take you away.

1048
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:45,660
Who do you mean to me?

1049
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:48,470
I mean everything to you.

1050
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:52,360
How are we related?

1051
02:01:54,070 --> 02:01:55,370
We are poor.

1052
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:58,740
Every poor man is related to another.

1053
02:02:01,390 --> 02:02:03,540
How do you know that I'm poor?

1054
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:08,310
Because I belong
to the same fraternity.

1055
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:13,150
Can't a poor man know another?
Impossible.

1056
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:19,090
I get anxious at the sight of you.

1057
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:21,890
I feel dizzy.

1058
02:02:23,620 --> 02:02:27,330
I don't understand a thing.
Please don't come before me.

1059
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:34,250
Did you ever imagine why it happens?

1060
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:40,290
My mind goes blank
when it comes to you.

1061
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:43,690
That's because you love me.

1062
02:02:44,630 --> 02:02:47,180
You lost your memory
because of the train accident.

1063
02:02:50,870 --> 02:02:51,970
Train?

1064
02:02:54,270 --> 02:02:55,420
Accident?

1065
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,540
Love?

1066
02:02:59,910 --> 02:03:01,190
No, no!

1067
02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:03,500
I never loved you.

1068
02:03:05,230 --> 02:03:06,900
I don't know you.

1069
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:09,540
I never travelled by train.

1070
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:14,740
Don't fret. Think.

1071
02:03:17,730 --> 02:03:18,930
Try to remember.

1072
02:03:20,070 --> 02:03:24,090
You are sick, aren't you?
I want to get you cured.

1073
02:03:26,730 --> 02:03:28,130
I'm not sick.

1074
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:31,930
The professor is sick.
He needs treatment.

1075
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:35,080
I'm absolutely fine.

1076
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,070
I'm marrying the professor.

1077
02:03:42,330 --> 02:03:45,630
Don't bother me. Go away.

1078
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:48,380
I'm feeling dizzy. Go away.

1079
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:50,500
Should I?

1080
02:03:54,350 --> 02:03:57,360
I won't go alone.
I'm here to take you along.

1081
02:03:58,460 --> 02:04:02,320
- You can't marry the professor.
- Who are you to stop me?

1082
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:04,040
I?

1083
02:04:08,770 --> 02:04:12,730
I love you.

1084
02:04:13,950 --> 02:04:15,700
I hope you won't forget me.

1085
02:04:18,810 --> 02:04:20,970
That's what I had written
inside the train compartment.

1086
02:04:22,130 --> 02:04:23,230
Remember?

1087
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:25,690
Try to remember.

1088
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:33,150
You didn't write that.
The professor wrote it.

1089
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:36,470
The professor has no right
to write it. I will erase it.

1090
02:04:36,650 --> 02:04:38,150
I won't let you erase it.

1091
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:43,800
- It's a question of my life.
- My love has decided on your fate.

1092
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:49,900
You are my life.
You must come with me.

1093
02:04:52,690 --> 02:04:54,640
Take those probing eyes off me!

1094
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,450
Look into my eyes.

1095
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,660
You will find your way.

1096
02:05:07,930 --> 02:05:09,030
No.

1097
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:11,960
No.

1098
02:05:12,910 --> 02:05:14,010
No!

1099
02:05:14,930 --> 02:05:16,720
You have nothing to do in my life.

1100
02:05:17,790 --> 02:05:18,990
Nothing.

1101
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:23,380
The professor means life to me.

1102
02:05:24,670 --> 02:05:26,200
I belong to him.

1103
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:30,910
My heart, my world...

1104
02:05:32,590 --> 02:05:36,780
my hopes... I give everything
to the professor.

1105
02:05:38,910 --> 02:05:41,780
Go away, please.

1106
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:45,020
You are sick of me.

1107
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:49,400
I won't come to harass you.
Never!

1108
02:05:52,180 --> 02:05:54,860
Let me give you a token of love.

1109
02:05:55,490 --> 02:05:58,400
If you ever get your memory back,
do remember me.

1110
02:06:01,390 --> 02:06:03,810
What have you done?
I didn't ask you to kill her!

1111
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:13,270
You have forgotten me

1112
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,280
May I never remember you

1113
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:44,960
Please don't compel me

1114
02:07:45,030 --> 02:07:49,620
I beseech you, let me grieve

1115
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:57,750
I live only for you...

1116
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:02,620
for those sorrows you've given me

1117
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:11,060
I'm heartbroken

1118
02:08:16,410 --> 02:08:18,700
You have forgotten me

1119
02:08:19,050 --> 02:08:21,580
May I never remember you

1120
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:39,360
I have failed in love

1121
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:44,070
I got nothing I desired

1122
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:52,120
I could never find happiness

1123
02:08:52,710 --> 02:08:56,750
Our eyes met,
but our hearts failed to unite

1124
02:09:00,330 --> 02:09:05,180
I have seen the outcome of love

1125
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:13,040
You have forgotten me

1126
02:09:13,230 --> 02:09:15,520
May I never remember you

1127
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:32,110
My heart is bereft of love

1128
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:36,650
For you don't love me

1129
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:44,450
I shall stop seeking love

1130
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:49,350
I shall make music no more

1131
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:57,690
I shall not sing,
and I beseech you not to sing

1132
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:08,150
You have forgotten me!
May you never come to mind

1133
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:17,880
I have forgotten you,
may you never come to mind

1134
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:43,470
- Doctor...
- Nothing to worry about.

1135
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:47,870
It's not a deep gash. She'll soon
come around, you can take her home.

1136
02:11:03,590 --> 02:11:04,690
Professor...

1137
02:11:11,570 --> 02:11:12,970
How is she now?

1138
02:11:18,330 --> 02:11:20,620
- What happened to you?
- Nothing, sir.

1139
02:11:21,910 --> 02:11:23,890
I was punished
for hitting an innocent girl.

1140
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:27,340
- Come with me to the doctor.
- No, sir.

1141
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:31,290
- How is she?
- Don't be crazy. She isn't badly hurt.

1142
02:11:31,510 --> 02:11:33,040
Let's dress the wound first.

1143
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:01,580
How are you feeling now?

1144
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:05,120
I'm fine.

1145
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,620
Who are you?

1146
02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:13,150
- The doctor?
- No.

1147
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:15,540
I'm the professor...

1148
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:21,050
Professor? Who?

1149
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:22,790
Your professor.

1150
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:25,850
My professor?

1151
02:12:26,890 --> 02:12:28,480
What have I got to do with you?

1152
02:12:29,980 --> 02:12:31,690
I don't know you.

1153
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:37,010
Where's my co-traveller?

1154
02:12:50,270 --> 02:12:51,470
Laat Saab.

1155
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:54,730
I hope you aren't hurt?

1156
02:12:57,060 --> 02:12:58,980
Have you really come around?

1157
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:00,600
Yes.

1158
02:13:01,170 --> 02:13:04,160
I fell unconscious due to the injury.

1159
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:07,360
Who is he?

1160
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:09,760
He's my professor.

1161
02:13:10,580 --> 02:13:12,210
He taught me in college.

1162
02:13:18,230 --> 02:13:19,730
Your hand is hurt.

1163
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:26,030
Unfortunately, our train
met with an accident.

1164
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:36,140
I hope you haven't forgotten
your promise?

1165
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:39,250
Can I ever forget that?

1166
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:42,780
- Sorry, professor.
- Good luck, doctor
